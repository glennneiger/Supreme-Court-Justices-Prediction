unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
when
they
entered...
embarked
on
this
enterprise,
enmund
was
aware
that
his
friend
had
a
gun?
unknown
speaker
on
the
ballistics
tests,
how
many
different
guns
were
indicated?
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
people
involved
in
the
enterprise?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reasonable
inference
that
there
were
three
different
firearms
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
said
that
there
were
two
that
they
could
identify
and
one
they
couldn't
identify.
that
makes
three.
unknown
speaker
how
many
bullets
were
put
in
the
bodies?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
would
be
irrational
for
reasonable
jurors
to
have
concluded
that
everybody
involved
in
that
automobile
knew
about
the
number
of
guns
that
were
present
and
who
had
them?
unknown
speaker
my
question
didn't
go
to
that.
suppose...
jurors
often
conclude
things
which
are
not
covered
by
instructions,
and
they
are
permitted
to
do
so.
would
it
be
irrational
or
unreasonable
for
a
juror
to
conclude
that
everyone
in
that
car
knew
that
this
was
an
armed
enterprise?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
legal
fiction
or
is
it
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
a
participant
in
a
felony
which
results
in
death
has
that
consequence?
you
call
it
a
legal
fiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
in
fact
something
a
little
different
from
a
fiction,
just
a
judgment
by
the
state
involved
that
if
you
participate
in
a
robbery,
and
because
a
robbery
is
sufficiently
likely
to
lead
to
a
fatal
killing,
that
you
are
going
to
be
held
accountable
for
the
killing,
too,
without
regard
to
your
intent
as
to
kill?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
the
argument
is
aided
by
stripping
away
whatever
there
is
of
a
fiction,
and
just
looking
at
the,
you
know,
what
facts
the
state
has
proved
and
what
reasons
are
traditionally
held
out
for
the
felony
murder
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
mr.
liebman,
in
this
case
he
is
guilty
of
murder,
in
your
book.
unknown
speaker
and
he
has
to
be
sentenced
to
something,
right?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
saying,
turn
him
loose.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
i...
i
don't
think
you
have
quite...
exactly
what
is
your
position
in
this
case?
what
should
this
man
have
been
sentenced
to,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
you
said
life
imprisonment
for
25
years?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
coker's
case,
nobody
died,
and
here
someone
did
die
as
a
result
of
the
enterprise
with
which
enmund
was
connected.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
get
around
to
suggesting
what
culpability
means?
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
want
to--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if...
would
it
be
enough
in
your
book
if
enmund
had
said,
well,
i
will
wait
for
you
in
the
car,
you've
got
guns,
if
necessary,
go
ahead
and
use
them?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
care
about...
what
is
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
i
suppose,
in
your
book
if
he
just
knew
they
had
guns.
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
say
what
i
said
he
said.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
a
jury
question,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
is
circumstantial
proof
of
intent.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
saying
that
just
the
fact
that
you
participate
in
a
robbery,
there
are
so
many
robberies
that
don't
involve
a
threat
to
life
that
you...
that
is
just
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
inferring
intent.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that?
suppose
in
this
very
case
the
jury
had
been
instructed
that
to
find
enmund
guilty
you
had
to
find
that
he
intended
to
take
life,
based
on
circumstantial
evidence.
suppose
the
jury
had
come
back
with
a
finding
of
guilty
and
imposing
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
would
that
evidence
be...
would
that
be
a
sufficient
basis
for...
right
on
this
record?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
you
don't
suggest
that
a
person
has
to
pull
the
trigger
himself
or--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
sure.
unknown
speaker
pertaining
to
your
point
about
intent,
assume
in
this
case
that
enmund
was
the
only
member
of
this
group
who
entered
the
residence.
he
was
armed,
but
he
had
no
intention
to
shoot,
so
he
testified.
a
struggle
ensued
in
which
the
gun
went
off,
his
gun
went
off
accidentally.
what
would
that
situation--
unknown
speaker
--how
would
that
be
viewed
in
light
of
your
emphasis
on
intention?
he
would
testify
he
had
no
intention
whatever
to
use
the
gun.
it
went
off
accidentally.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
the
fact
that
he
carried
a
gun
was
no
different
from
the
fact
that
coker
carried
a
knife.
unknown
speaker
he
wielded
it,
but
he
didn't
quite
use
it.
unknown
speaker
as
a
threat.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaden.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
he
procured
the
weapons?
unknown
speaker
what
is
support
for
your
statement
that
he
procured
the
weapons?
unknown
speaker
then
he
also
helped
to...
undertook
to
conceal
the
weapons
after
the
crime,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
the
death
penalty
ought
to
be
available
under
our
cases
in
a
case
of
negligent
homicide--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
would
say
if
the
florida
legislature
provides
the
death
penalty
for
negligent
homicide
there
would
be
nothing
that
any
federal
court
could
do
about
it.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
death
is
both...
the
occurrence
of
the
victim's
death
is
both,
in
effect,
a
necessary
and
a
sufficient
basis
for
imposing
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
liable
to
be
a
better
word
than
eligible
for?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
this
case
there
had
been
no
guns
involved,
but
two
people
went
in
the
house,
and
one
of
the
victims
pulled
a
gun,
and
one
of
the
robbers
picked
up
an
ashtray,
a
glass
ashtray
and
killed
them
with
it?
unknown
speaker
they
are
no
different.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
would
apply
to
the
man
who
was
sitting
out
in
the
car?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
you
just
put
them
a
moment
ago,
it
wouldn't
hurt
the
state
to
have
to
prove
intent.
i
would
think
you...
the
facts
the
way
you
reviewed
them
would
indicate
that--
unknown
speaker
--excuse
me.
did
you
say
the
defendant
killed
them?
shot
them?
he
shot
them?
unknown
speaker
oh,
well,
you
said,
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so.
would
it
be
constitutional
for
a
state
to
provide
that
at
any
time
firearms,
loaded
firearms
are
used
and
death
then
results,
intent
is
presumed?
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
gun
be
loaded
would
be
even
a
stronger
case
than
ordinary
felony
homicide
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
you
are
saying
in
certain
circumstances
you
don't
require
intent.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
under
existing
florida
law
without
regard
to
what
considerations
there
may
be
under
the
eighth
amendment,
are
there
homicides
which
do
not
require
intent
or
even
the
constructive
intent
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
here,
but
that
nonetheless
render
one
liable
to
the
death
sentence?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
just
your
run
of
the
mine
homicides.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
lowest
level
of
intent
you
can
have
for
a
homicide
in
florida
and
still
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty
under
florida
statutes?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
prove
intent
there
at
all.
unknown
speaker
except
to--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
to
prove
intent
to
rob,
though,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean,
counsel,
that
the
sentencing
authority
could
not
consider
the
degree
of
his
participation?
unknown
speaker
was
that
precluded?
that
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
petitioner.
unknown
speaker
explain
why
and
how.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
thing,
he
can't
be
found
innocent
any
more
than
once,
can
he?
right?
he
can't
be
found
innocent--
unknown
speaker
--more
than
once,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
except
for
mr.
spinkelnik,
when
was
the
last
time
anybody
was
executed
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
except
for
that,
when
was
the
last
time?
unknown
speaker
you
go
through
all
these
motions,
and--
unknown
speaker
--it
never
happens.
unknown
speaker
in
where?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kaden,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
the
trial
judge
found,
i
believe,
that
the
defendant
enmund
and
the
defendant
sampson
armstrong
each
fired
into
the
bodies
of
mr.
and
mrs.
kersey.
now,
the
appellate
court
came
up
with
a
different
holding.
how
does
that
affect
the
sentencing
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
trial
court
made
that
finding,
and
then
also
said
that
the
defendant's
participation
was
major,
was
the
finding
that
his
participation
was
major
based
on
the
belief
that
he
had
fired
the
shot?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
we
do
when
the
appellate
court
throws
it
out?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
florida
law
say
what
a
mitigating
circumstance
is,
or
is
it
just
undefined?
unknown
speaker
well,
none
of
them
is
participation
or
a
lack
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
the
supreme
court
is
saying.
there
aren't
any
mitigating
circumstances
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o
clock.
