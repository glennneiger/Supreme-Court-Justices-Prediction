mr.
newton
n.
minow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
where
the
ftc
has
been
obsessed
with
the
past,
unconcerned
with
the
present,
and
blind
to
the
future.
this
court
decided
the
important
goldfarb
case
in
june
of
1975.
the
american
medical
association
immediately
recognized
the
profound
implications
of
goldfarb
for
the
medical
profession
and
promptly
undertook
a
major
revision
of
its
ethical
standards
and
policies
in
light
of
goldfarb.
without
any
investigation
of
any
kind
to
learn
the
ama's
position,
the
ftc
filed
this
complaint
in
the
dark.
we
first
heard
of
it
when
the
ftc
had
a
press
conference
in
washington
and
a
reporter
called
the
ama's
office
in
chicago
to
inquire
about
the
ama's
position.
once
it
had
been
filed,
the
ftc
gave
its
attention
only
to
the
past.
five
years
later
judge
mansfield
observed
the
commission
"was
still
pressing
for
its
pound
of
flesh.
"
he
said
the
ftc's
action
"has
been
unjustified,
unnecessary,
a
waste
of
administrative
and
judicial
resources,
and
in
my
view
the
ftc.
"
he
said,
"is
engaged
in
the
futile
business
of
beating
a
dead
horse.
"
why?
how
did
such
a
thing
happen?
ethical
principles
in
the
medical
profession
are
nothing
new.
they
go
back
thousands
of
years
before
the
time
of
hippocrates.
in
1975
when
this
case
began
most
states
throughout
the
united
states
had
laws
that
prohibited
professional
advertising.
in
the
light
of
goldfarb,
however,
we
recognized
there
was
a
need
for
change.
so
in
the
spring
of
1976
the
ama
published
a
new
statement
on
advertising
and
solicitation.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
did
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
learned
professions
were
subject--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--were
not
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
and
we
knew,
i
must
say
as
well,
we
knew
bates
was
pending
in
the
lower
courts
on
its
way
up
here,
so
we
were
aware
of
the
change,
the
fundamental
change
that
was
evolving
in
the
law
with
its
relationship
to
professions
and
with
its
relationship
to
the
first
amendment
in
advertising.
we
could
see
the
winds
of
change
were
coming
fast.
so
what
we
stated
in
the
spring
of
'76
was
this:
the
public
is
entitled
to
know
and
the
physician
is
entitled
to
advertise
useful
information
provided...
including
information
about
fees...
provided
only
that
the
information
was
not
false
or
misleading
or
deceptive.
and
we
suggested
and
defined
four
practices
that
we
believe
have
a
significant
capacity
to
mislead
patients.
now,
that
was
14
months
before
bates
was
decided.
consumer
groups,
including
the
ralph
nader
organization,
immediately
congratulated
the
ama
as
being
the
first
profession
to
move
with
the
evolving
law.
we
went
to
washington.
we
told
the
ftc
what
had
happened,
what
we
had
already
done
about
advertising.
to
no
avail.
we
told
the
ftc
of
our
new
positions
on
contract
practice,
practices
to
which
the
ftc
has
not
objected
to
this
day.
we
got
nowhere
with
the
staff
so
we
filed
a
formal
motion
with
the
commission
and
said
to
the
commission
you
ought
to
reconsider
this
in
light
of
what
we've
done.
besides,
the
supreme
court
is
considering
bates.
it's
on
the
docket
of
the
supreme
court.
why
don't
you
wait
until
the
supreme
court
decides
the
law
in
bates
and
then
decide
whether
our
current
positions
are
appropriate
to
meet
the
law.
denied.
june
'77
this
court
decided
bates.
the
court's
opinion,
written
by
justice
blackmun,
refers
to
the
ama's
current
standards.
the
court
says
professional
societies
should
help
to
define
the
line
between
deceptive
and
nondeceptive
practices...
precisely
what
the
ama
had
done
14
months
earlier.
and
as
the
law
further
developed,
values
changed,
the
ama
continued
to
revise
and
to
improve
its
guidelines.
you
would
think
the
ftc
would
have
given
us
a
medal.
instead,
we
had
a
long,
tedious
trial
concentrating
on
the
events
of
the
'20s,
and
the
'30s,
and
the
'40s,
and
the
'50s,
and
the
'60s
and
the
early
'70s,
all
pre-goldfarb,
in
what
justice
jackson
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
in
1952
in
oregon
state
medical
society
called
a
great
amount
of
archaeology.
after
exhuming
all
this
archaeology,
the
ftc
introduced
no
evidence
whatever
on
the
competitive
impact
of
the
ama's
current
policies
on
price,
quality,
availability
of
medical
care.
we
called
witnesses
like
the
late
dr.
michael
halberstam,
the
late
dr.
france
inglefinger,
who
was
then
the
editor
of
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine;
and
they
told
how
the
practices
that
we
thought
were
misleading
could
horribly
misguide
and
mislead
patients,
particularly
the
poor,
the
unsophisticated.
we
showed
through
the
tragic
testimony
of
victims,
particularly
women
who
responded
to
ads
about
cosmetic
surgery,
who
ended
up
being
butchered
on
a
filthy
operating
table
and
even
to
death.
the
response
of
the
ftc
was
rescind
all
your
guidelines,
get
out
of
the
business
of
trying
to
define
the
line
between
deceptive
and
nondeceptive
practices,
make
no
pronouncements
whatever
on
advertising
for
two
years,
and
then
even
after
the
two
years
don't
do
anything
without
our
permission
first.
we
went
to
the
ftc.
we
said
good
lord,
if
hippocrates
were
alive
today,
he'd
need
your
permission
before
he
could
write
the
hippocratic
oath.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
just
at
the
break
i
was
saying
we
then
appealed
to
the
full
commission.
the
commission
made
no
analysis
of
any
kind
about
whether
our
current
positions
promoted
or
impeded
competition.
they
didn't
even
look
at
any
anti-competitive
consequence,
pro-competitive
consequence.
then
in
a
curious
opinion
it
said
that
it
itself
was
not
capable
of
writing
new
guidelines
with
respect
to
advertising;
but
then
in
a
process
which
it
called
exegesis,
it
then
proceeded
to
say
that
our
guidelines
were
"troublesome",
"worrisome",
"overbroad".
we've
got
a
strange
opinion.
it's
not
a
case
where
the
ftc
is
saying
we
have
a
better
set
of
guidelines
that
we
want
you
to
follow.
it's
not
a
case
where
the
ftc
is
saying
why
we
think
your
guidelines
are
wrong
or
violate
the
law.
it's
not
a
case
where
the
ftc
found
that
our
current
guidelines
have
any
anti-competitive
consequence.
it
is
a
case
where
the
law,
where
social
values
were
exploding
and
changing
very
quickly,
where
goldfarb,
bates
were
creating
a
revolution
in
the
thinking
about
the
law
and
the
professions.
now,
in
the
light
of
bates
why
does
the
ftc
press
on?
why
are
we
still
fighting?
mr.
newton
n.
minow
very
much,
justice
rehnquist.
we
also
did
at
the
court
of
appeals.
we
said
there's
no
cognizable
risk
of
any
recurrence
here.
all
these
practices
have
stopped.
but
the
ftc
said
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
that
our
pre-goldfarb
orders,
pre-goldfarb
orders
violated
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
and
therefore,
in
its
discretion
it
would
take
the
action
that
it
did.
now,
i
think
there
is
an
important
question
of
jurisdiction
involved.
perhaps
that's
why
the
ftc
presses
on.
i
think
the
ftc
is
stretching
to
establish
a
precedent
that
it
has
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
over
not-for-profit
professional
associations.
unlike
the
sherman
act,
unlike
the
clayton
act,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
does
not
apply
to
everybody.
the
clayton
act,
passed
at
the
same
congress
as
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
applies
to
all
associations,
all
persons.
but
when
it
got
to
writing
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
congress
very
carefully
limited
the
language
of
the
ftc's
jurisdiction
to
an
association
"organized
to
carry
on
business
for
its
own
profit
or
the
profit
of
its
members.
"
unlike
the
sherman
act,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
is
not
a
carefully
studied
attempt
to
bring
everyone
within
its
jurisdiction.
now,
the
three
not-for-profit
institutions,
professional
associations
that
are
here
simply
are
not
organized
to
carry
on
business
for
their
own
profit
or
for
that
of
their
members.
it
is
undisputed,
undisputed
in
the
record,
even
taking
the
ftc's
witness,
that
the
bulk,
the
principal
part
of
each
association's
resources
are
devoted
to
furthering
not
economic
interests,
not
profit.
it
is
equally
undisputed
that
when
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
passed
in
1914
that
learned
professions
were
not
regarded
as
business.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
the
ama's
biggest
activity
in
dollars
is
publishing,
and
a
lot
of
scientific
journals,
magazines.
on
its
business
activities
it
pays
taxes.
the
bulk
of
its
activity
involves
accreditation
of
medical
schools,
scientific
work,
research,
validating
drugs.
the
chief
justice
is
familiar
with
its
work
involving
prisons
and
health
in
prisons.
it's
involved
fundamentally
in
work
involving
advancing
health
is
the
bulk
of
its
activity.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
medical
profession
is
outside
the
antitrust
laws.
we
don't
suggest
that
at
all.
we
understand
that
the
justice
department
can
invoke
the
sherman
act
against
professionals
in
the
federal
courts.
the
federal
courts
are
equipped
to
make
the
delicate
assessments
required
of
purpose
and
effect
required
to
apply
antitrust
standards
to
the
not-for-profit
sector.
but
the
ftc,
we
contend,
with
its
tunnel
vision
is
not
so
equipped
to
make
those
judgments.
we
do
say
the
ftc
was
on
the
right
track
in--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--justice
white,
i
was
just
saying
congress
didn't
intend--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--we
think
congress
did
not
intend
it
originally.
moreover,
congress
did
not
intend
it
in
1977.
the
ftc
went
to
congress
in--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--no,
but
we
think
the
ftc
was
designed
at
the
beginning,
based
on
its
legislative
history,
to
have
expertise
involving
industries,
and
there
was
nothing
at
all
talked
about
at
that
time
involving
the
professions.
in
1977
the
ftc
went
to
congress
and
said
we'd
like
you,
senators,
congressmen,
to
change
the
law
to
expand
our
jurisdiction
over
the
not-for-profit
sector.
i
think
that
was
the
right
way
to
deal
with
this
question.
they
went
to
congress.
they
put
in
their
case.
congress
said
no,
absolutely
no.
so
the
law
was
not
changed
in
1977.
to
show
you
that
another
reason--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--the
law
was
left
as
it
was
written
in
1914.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
to
show
you
again
its--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--that's
correct,
including
professional
associations
as
well.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
we
think
that
the
statutory
language,
unlike
the
ftc's
argument,
first
of
all
talks
about
profit
rather
than
economic
benefit.
we
think
any
not-for-profit
association,
whether
it
be
the
smithsonian
institution,
the
american
bar
association,
or
the
american
medical
association,
any
such
institution
offers
some
benefits
to
its
members,
whether
it
be...
whether
i'm
involved
in
public
broadcasting,
whether
it
be
involved
in
getting
a
free
subscription
to
a
magazine,
or
free
parking,
or
buying
insurance
or
whatever.
there's
some
amount
of
it.
we
say
when
the
bulk,
predominant
part
of
an
activity
and
its
purpose
and
its
motivation
is
not
designed
for
its
own
profit
or
that
of
its
members,
then
clearly
it's
not
within
the
act.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
well,
the
ftc
says
you
should
weigh
your
budget
and
see
what
it
is.
if
you
take
that
test,
we
don't
think
that's
a
very
sensible
test,
but
if
you
take
that
test,
we
each
produced
experts.
our
experts
said
91
percent
goes
for
scientific,
educational.
their
experts
said
something
like
35
percent
goes
for
economic
benefits;
35
to
43
they
said
goes
for
economic
benefits.
i
don't
think
that's
it.
i
think
it's
whether
it's
organized...
i'll
go
back
to
the
statutory
language...
is
it
organized
for
the
benefit
of
itself
for
profit
for
itself
or
its
members.
what
was
its
intention.
we
recognize,
justice
rehnquist,
that
trade
associations
are
subject
to
the
act.
we
recognize
that.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
for
the
profit
of
their
members.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
if
it
does,
it's
insignificant.
the
administrative
law
judge,
justice
white,
said
that
if
the
ama
improves
medical
standards
of
medical
schools
or
advances
health,
that's
for
the
economic
benefit
of
the
doctors
because
that
will
produce
more
patients.
we
think
that's
preposterous.
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
doing
medical
research
or
validating
of
drugs.
i
think
we're
not
any
different
from
the
lawyers,
or
any
other
professional
association,
or
librarians.
i
don't
think
people
join
professional
associations
with
the
idea
that
they're
going
to
make
money
off
it.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
would
you
believe
that
it
was
contended
here
that
our
continuing
education
programs
are
for
the
profit
of
our
members,
because
if
you
learn
something
there,
you'll
get
more
patients.
that's
silly.
that's
not
why
professionals
conduct
continuing
education
programs.
it's
to
keep--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--help
advance
your
knowledge,
help
advance
your
professional
skills,
yes,
but
you
don't
go
there
for
profit.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
would
think
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
would
think
so,
but
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
ama
or
the
connecticut
medical
society
or
the
new
haven
medical
society
were
organized
for
the
purpose
of
producing
profit
for
themselves
or
their
members.
that's
a
different
question.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
to
advance
your
skills
or
advance
your...
right.
i
would
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
for
the
public
good
as
well.
in
1978,
as
the
court
knows,
it
decided
professional
engineers.
that
is
the
third
case.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
what's
important
here
is
goldfarb,
bates,
professional
engineers.
professional
engineers
said
when
you
look
at
an
ethical
canon,
a
professional
canon,
and
that
case
involved
engineers,
you
judge
as
to
whether
it
promotes
or
it
impedes
competition.
what
did
the
ftc
do?
it
didn't
even
look
at
that
question.
it
didn't
even
look
at
our
1976,
our
current
standards.
how
did
they
get
around
it?
they
got
around
it,
as
justice
rehnquist
said,
they
said
your
'71
standards
are
no
good
pre-goldfarb.
and
therefore,
in
the
exercise
of
our
remedial
discretion
we're
going
to
knock
you
for
'76
out
as
well,
and
we're
just
going
to
put
you
under
this
order
where
you're
out
of
the
business.
now,
we
think
that's
wrong.
why
do
we
think
that's
so
wrong?
because
we
think
there's
a
big
risk
and
a
big
danger
to
patients.
if
a
doctor
says
i
cured
my
last
25
patients,
we
think
that's
false,
deceptive,
misleading;
we
think
it's
dangerous.
no
two
patients
are
alike.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
difficulty,
the
danger,
the
risk.
i
ask
the
court
to
take
the
time
to
read
the
evidence,
read
the
testimony
of
these
poor
patients
who
saw
an
ad
in
a
magazine
or
a
newspaper,
usually
a
woman
with
a
cosmetic
surgery.
they
ended
up,
as
i
say,
being
butchered.
that's
the
risk.
you're
not
dealing
here
with
products.
you're
dealing
with
health.
you're
dealing
with
life.
you're
dealing
with
safety.
we
think
there
should
be
guidelines
and
protection
for
the
public.
we've
said
to
the
ftc
repeatedly
why
don't
you
get
the
consumer
protection
division
of
the
ftc
and
do
something
about
stopping
these
things
instead
of
trying
to
deal
with
us
who
are
trying
to
establish
guidelines
to
protect
the
public?
we
get
no
answer.
the
ftc
says,
moreover,
and
i'm
sure
you'll
hear
from
it,
that
there
were
some
activities
post-goldfarb
by
the
states,
by
the
local
societies.
i
point
out
to
the
court
there
are
some
1,900
state
and
local
medical
societies
in
this
gigantic
country
of
ours
with
230
million
people
speeding
across
3,000
miles.
we
are
not
in
control
or
in
charge
at
the
ama
of
state
and
local
societies.
they
are
independent.
they
are
autonomous.
they're
on
their
own.
they
may
or
may
not
choose
to
follow
ama
principles
or
standards.
in
many
cases
we
don't
even
know
what
they
do,
and
i
point
that
out.
with
respect
to
the
ama,
which
is
the
party
in
the
case,
the
ama
immediately
after
the
1976
publication
of
its
standards
did
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
advertising
at
any
time.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
think
it
would
depend,
justice
rehnquist,
whether
it
was
in
the
statutory
test
organized
for
its
own
profit
or
the
profit
of
its
members.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
we
have
absolutely
no
restrictions
whatever
on
minimum
fees,
on
maximum
fees.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
yes.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
right.
oh,
i
think
that
would
be...
of
course,
under
the
sherman
act
it's
been
held
that--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--yes,
it
would.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
under
the
federal
trade
commission's
jurisdiction,
but
certainly
under
goldfarb
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
ftc
has--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--well,
but
i
was
saying
if
there
was
an
association
that
was
organized
for
profit--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--yes.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i'd
say
we
are
certainly
subject
to
the
sherman
act--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--i
think
there's
a
serious
question
of
whether
we...
i
do
not
change
our
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
we're
not
a
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
section
4.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
that's
correct.
we'd
say
that
the
remedy
lies...
in
fact,
there
have
been
cases,
there
have
been
cases
where
state
associations
have
been
sued
by
the
justice
department
for
such
actions.
we
say
that's
where
it
belongs.
other
states
as
well,
other
states
as
well.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
not
that
we're
aware
of.
well,
i'm
aware
of
it
this
way,
justice
white.
we're
also
counsel
for
the
american
bar
association
in
its
case
in
this
area
where
the
justice
department
pursued
the
case.
as
you'll
recall,
as
soon
as
the
aba
changed
its
rules,
the
justice
department
dropped
the
case.
they
said
it's
finished,
over,
done.
but
the
federal
trade
commission,
that's
why
i--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
we'd
be
glad
to
defend
chief
justice
taft
any
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that.
we
think
it
was
a
perfectly
proper
role
in
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
yes.
we
think
that
ethics--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--i
think
that
professionals
are
citizens
who
under
the
first
amendment
have
a
right
to
freely
associate
with
each
other,
to
join
in
trying
to
establish
professional
ethical
standards.
we
recognize
if
they
got
together
and
fixed
prices
or
did
something
like
that,
we
recognize
that's
wrong.
but
there
is
an
area
of
speech
which
is
protected,
which
is
constitutionally
protected.
you
know,
when
we
had
dr.
halberstam
looking
at
it
from
a
doctor's
point
of
view,
what
did
dr.
halberstam
say
about
this?
he
said
if
there
is
anything
that's
erosive
to
the
very
nature
of
professionalism
it's
the
idea
that
a
profession
cannot
govern
its
members'
ethical
standards.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
not
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
where
we're
saying
yes,
advertise;
in
fact,
we
think
that
that
promotes
competition
to
have
information
in
the
marketplace
for
patients,
we
think
it's
desirable,
but
don't
do
it
in
a
false
or
misleading
way.
that's
our
position.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
think
that's
per
se
improper.
we
don't
defend
that.
but
what
we
do
say
is
that
when
professionals
in
this
case
are
trying
to
advance
ethical
standards
for
the
benefit
of
patients,
of
informing
patients
without
deceiving
them,
we
think
the
government
ought
to
encourage
them,
not
condemn
them.
we
think
that
that's
what's
involved.
the
record
shows
that
the
state
licensing
body
said
we
welcome
the
role
of
the
professional
societies.
they
help
us.
this
court
said
in
bates
we
think
it's
important.
i
come
back
to
what
judge
mansfield
said.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
when
the
case
began,
when
the
ftc
had
its
first
announcement
of
it,
all
the
attention
was
on
advertising.
when
they
got
into
that
and
saw
we
had
changed
our
rules,
they
changed
their
focus
to
talking
about
contract
practice.
all
those
contract
practice
rules
have
gone
by
the
boards
years,
decades
long
ago.
most
of
the
doctors
today,
justice
stevens,
who
are
in
practice
one
way
or
another,
in
hmos,
hospitals,
are
involved
in
some
contractual
relationship
for
their
services.
so
we
regard
that
as
archaic,
gone;
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
current
of
any
kind.
we
don't
defend
those
old
practices.
we
published
new
ones
in
1977
in
the
first
edition
of
our
guidebook
that
we
could,
and
that's
gone
by
the
boards.
we
don't
defend
it.
thank
you.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
answer
to
what
my
colleague,
mr.
shapiro,
just
said,
i
would
quote
judge
mansfield:
the
ftc
wants
to
press
for
a
pound
of
flesh.
this
argument
has
been
over
for
years
and
years
and
years.
they
want
some
kind
of
an
order.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
only,
justice
white,
if
there
is
some
risk
or
cognizable
danger--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--but
in
light
of
goldfarb--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--yes,
but
in
light
of
goldfarb/bates/professional
engineers,
the
likelihood
that
the
ama
is
going
to
go
back
to
its
pre-goldfarb
standards
is
nonexistent.
the
world
fundamentally
changed.
the
law
changed,
and
the
ama
responded.
counsel
for
the
ftc
never
said,
never
defended
in
all
this--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--as
for
our
pre-goldfarb
standards?
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
would
challenge
it
because
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
the
record
will
show,
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
the
ama
had
authorized
a
revision
of
its
guidelines,
but
they
were
not
satisfied
to
wait
two
months
until
we
got
it
out.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
yes,
we
do,
because
we
would
say
that
the
guidelines
we
had
at
that
time
met
the
law
at
that
time;
that
the
law
changed
and
as
quickly
as
we
could
in
a
membership
organization
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
going
through
the
process
spelled
out
by
its
procedures
and
constitution,
as
quickly
as
anybody
humanly
could,
before
any
other
profession
did
it
we
responded.
so
i
would
say
yes,
we
were
all
right
under
that
standard.
never
today
did
the
ftc
say
that
our
'76
standards
were
wrong.
never
did
they
point
out
why
they
were
wrong.
and
it's
nonsense
to
say
there
was
a
conspiracy.
the
brief
if
you
read
it...
you
know,
the
dentists
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
ftc
that
said
whatever
happens
to
the
doctors
will
also
happen
to
the
dentists.
that
shows
how
interested
the
ftc
is
in
the
particular
facts
about
associations
or
differences
between
the
professions.
but
the
dentists
say
it's
ridiculous
to
say
there
was
a
conspiracy
going
on
pre-goldfarb.
accountants,
lawyers,
doctors,
dentists...
everybody
had
a
different
view
of
where
the
profession
stood
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
laws.
this
court
decided
goldfarb.
we
immediately--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--that's
right,
justice
stevens.
and
as
i
say,
that
stuff
was
long
gone.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
regard...
if
there's
any
part
of
the
case
that's
gone
and
moot,
i'd
say
that's
it
because
that's--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--i
don't
know
that
i'd
characterize
it
as
illegal
because
it
was
nonexistent
at
the
time.
the
fact
was
that
for
a
period
of
40
years
all
those
practices
had
been
abandoned.
more
than
half
the
doctors--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--yes.
it
was
all
pre-goldfarb,
justice
stevens.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
understand,
but
i
repeat,
these
are
all
pre-goldfarb.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
i
think
the
law--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--i
think
lawyers
could
differ
on
it,
but
certainly
there
had
never
been
any
holding
by
this
court
until
goldfarb,
as
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
its
opinion
to
say
this
is
the
first
time
we've
ever
held
that
the
learned
professions
are
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
in
goldfarb.
and
i
think
there
could
be--
mr.
newton
n.
minow
--the
oregon
state
medical
society
case,
you
will
recall,
ended
up
without
any...
this
court
upheld
a
dismissal.
mr.
newton
n.
minow
and
believe
me,
if
there
had
been
any
conduct
by
the
ama
post
either
the
decision
against
the
ama
in
the
'30s
or
post-oregon,
believe
me,
we
would
have
heard
about
it
from
the
department
of
justice.
all
this
stuff
was
a
dead
letter
and
gone.
they
were
never
enforced.
there's
never
been
any
action
by
the
ama
enforcing
one
of
those
rules
at
any
time.
they
were
ignored,
they
were
forgotten,
and
they
were
never
enforced.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
