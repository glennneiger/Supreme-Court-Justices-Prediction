unknown
speaker
well,
does
goldfarb
deal
with
advertising
or
solicitation?
unknown
speaker
were
not
exempt.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
press
your
w.t.
grant
and
company
argument
before
the
ftc?
unknown
speaker
does
the
ama
conduct
any
business
enterprise
other
than
perhaps
the
ama
journal?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
would
be
a
reason
for
deciding
in
your
favor.
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
it
to
cover
it,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
congress
might
have
covered
it
whether
they
had
the
ability
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but
that
question
doesn't
depend
on
how
able
the
ftc
is.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
law
was.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
proposed
change,
mr.
minow,
would
have
added
all
nonprofit
corporations,
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
do
you
think
that
it
makes
any
difference
how
much
economic
assistance
an
organization
such
as
the
ama
would
give
to
its
members?
could
it
change
its
activities
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
it
under
the
act,
in
your
view,
by
increasing
the
amount
of
the
assistance?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
the
bulk
do
you
have
any
percentage
figure
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
why
are
they?
they
don't
make
profit
themselves,
but
they're
organized
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
doesn't
the
ama
have
any
impact
on
the
profitmaking
capabilities
of
doctors?
they
certainly
are
in
business
for
a
profit.
unknown
speaker
so
what
if
the
ama,
perhaps
what
it
does
has
a
series
of
adult
education
programs
for
doctors
to
keep
them
up
to
date.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
not
be
why,
but
you
don't
suggest
that
it
doesn't
help.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
the
more
skillful
the
physician,
i
take
it
the
more
other
physicians
would
lean
on
him,
for
example.
is
the
cost
of
attending
those
programs
deductible
for
income
tax
purposes?
unknown
speaker
because
they
produce
income.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
mr.
minow,
that
if
it
is
deductible,
and
i
would
assume
that
it
is,
it's
on
the
same
basis
that
a
schoolteacher
taking
summer
courses
can
deduct,
summer
courses
at
the
university.
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
probably
profitmaking
except
that
it's
profitable
for
the
teacher
in
the
long
run,
but
we
would
hope
for
the
public,
too.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
rule
out
the
possibility
of
some
local
or
state
association
being
included
within
the
ftc's
jurisdiction,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
fixed
minimum
fee
a
la
the
goldfarb
case
had
the
same
experience,
the
same
kind
of
a
record
as
appeared
before
this
court
in
the
goldfarb?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
was
giving
you
a
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
went
that
far.
unknown
speaker
it
would
fall
under
goldfarb
then,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
position
was
not
that
you
weren't
sure,
but
it
definitely
would
not
be
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
because
you're
not
a
corporation.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
say
you
have
exactly
the
same
organization
you
have
today.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
engaged
in
the
activity
of
price
fixing.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
that's
what
i
thought.
your
position
is
you're
not
a
corporation,
so
even
if
you
did
that,
you
would
not
be
subject
to
the
federal
trade
commission.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
not
be
subject
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act
even
if
you
engage
in
price
fixing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minow,
is
there
a
jurisdictional
agreement
between
the
department
and
the
commission
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
cases
the
department
will
handle,
or
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
aware
of
any
jurisdictional
infighting
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
as
a
result
of
that
development
that
you
just
mentioned
that
chief
justice
taft
was
not
in
any
trouble
by
chairing
the
commission
that
wrote
the
code
of...
what
did
they
call
it...
the
canons
of
judicial
ethics
in
that
day
back
in
'25?
unknown
speaker
to
announce
standards
of
ethics.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
any
first
amendment
right
on
the
part
of
the
bar
association
or
the
medical
association
to
announce
any
standards
it
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
lumber
dealers
and
potters
may
have
thought
they
had
a
first
amendment
right
to
get
together
and
govern
the
professions,
so
to
speak,
govern
the
business
by
setting
prices,
but
certainly
that
wouldn't
carry
the
day,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understood
you
to
carve
out
price
fixing
as
always
being
subject
to--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
minow,
before
you
close
would
you
just
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
contract
practice
aspect
of
the
case,
because
that
really
isn't
right
within
the
line
of
cases
you've
been
discussing.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
some
previous
restrictions
were
eliminated.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
no
change
at
all
in
'76
and
'77?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
with
a
statement
in
the...
the
'76
statement
which
says
that
the
principles
do
not
proscribe
advertising;
they
proscribe
solicitation?
now,
there
was
no
statement
like
that
before
that.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
never
have
banned
advertising,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
need
a
cease
and
desist
order
to
keep
them
from
banning
advertising?
unknown
speaker
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit
on
something
that
seems
to
me
very
fundamental
here,
mr.
shapiro.
do
you
think
there
is
any
authority
in
the
state
or
the
government
or
by
statute
that
would
limit
the
rights
of
a
voluntary
group
of
lawyers,
doctors,
dentists,
or
any
other
profession
from
announcing
a
set
of
standards
that
precluded
advertising
and
solicitation?
unknown
speaker
a
voluntary
association
that
you
can
join
or
not
join?
i'm
not
talking
about
an
integrated
bar.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
announcement...
you
go
into
that
very
rapidly
for
me...
the
announcement
of
a
ten
commandments
by
a
lawyers'
club
or
a
doctors'
society,
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
that?
unknown
speaker
you're
making
that
jump
very
fast.
i'm
trying
to
take
you
one
step
at
a
time.
unknown
speaker
the
announcement
of
ethical
standards
like
the
ten
commandments
you
concede,
i
take
it,
that
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
that
here
is
the
way
we,
the
people
who
are
announcing
it,
think
the
profession
ought
to
be
practiced.
unknown
speaker
but
goldfarb
had
nothing
to
do
with
solicitation
or
advertising.
goldfarb
was
a
straight
price
fixing,
either
a
gentleman's
agreement
or
a
gentleman's
agreement
buttressed
by
the
bar
association
practice.
everyone
in
the
bar
would
charge
the
fixed
price.
unknown
speaker
all
the
lawyers
in
fairfax
county
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
to
quote
a
price
for
reading
a
title.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
just
talking
about
the
announcement
of
the
code.
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
liability
is
it
the
ftc's
normal
practice
to
say
liability
is
to
be
determined
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
like
in
antitrust
cases.
unknown
speaker
is
a
remedy
question.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
what
page
did
you
say
that
was?
unknown
speaker
371?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
to
that,
let
me
see
if
i
have
a
clear
impression
of
what
you're
saying
to
us
about
the
impact
of
goldfarb
and
bates.
you
say
that
goldfarb
and
bates,
or
either,
or
the
two
of
them
together
would
prohibit
a
group
of
lawyers
from
getting
together
and
saying
here
is
our
code:
it
is
unethical
to
solicit;
it
is
unethical
to
advertise;
and
you
can't
be
a
member
of
this
organization
unless
you
take
a
pledge
not
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
standing
alone.
unknown
speaker
not
a
profession.
members
of
a
professional
organization.
the
organization
i'm
talking
about
no
one
need
join
if
he
doesn't
want
to,
but
if
he
joins
he
must
accept
the
pledge
not
to
advertise.
would
you
say
that's
a
violation
of
law?
unknown
speaker
but
the
engineers
case
was
a
pledge,
a
binding
pledge
never
to
enter
into
competitive
bidding.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that's
the
same
as
a
pledge
not
to
advertise
or
solicit?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
if
in
this
town,
the
district
of
columbia,
twenty
lawyers
get
together
and
say
we
are
banding
together
to
be
a
very
ethical
group,
and
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
wrong,
and
that's
our
code,
they
can't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
my
number
is
twenty.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
push
me,
i'll
take
it
to
six.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
could
one
lawyer
say
i'm
a
very
ethical
lawyer
and
not
be
ethical?
unknown
speaker
then
it
will
come
down
to
two,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
the
firm
of
jones
and
jones,
jones
and
his
wife.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
go
so
far
on
this.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
go
so
far
on
it.
well,
you're
not
going
any
farther
than
a
nationwide
association.
unknown
speaker
but
you
seemed
at
the
moment,
whether
it's
relevant
or
not,
to
be
making
an
exception
if
a
law
firm
having
250
lawyers
tells
every
lawyer
in
that
firm
if
you
solicit
or
advertise,
you're
out.
a
violation
of
law?
unknown
speaker
a
law
firm
is
a
voluntary
association.
unknown
speaker
like
a
corporation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
i'm
interested
in
your
use
of
the
word
"entrepreneurial".
what
about
an
association
of
ministers,
say
the
southern
baptist
association?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
they
have
to
make
a
living?
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
interested
in
the
contributions
to
the
church?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
include
the
ministers.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
schoolteachers?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
nea?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
interested
in
elevating
the
salaries
of
teachers?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
shapiro,
isn't
the
nea
interested
in
the
profit
of
its
members?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
it?
it
is
concerned
with
education,
but
it's
also
concerned
with
the
profit
of
schoolteachers.
properly.
i'm
not
criticizing
that.
but
this
is
precisely
what
you
say,
as
i
understand
you,
is
the
situation
of
the
ama--
unknown
speaker
--you
put
the
nea
in
the
category
of
a
union
of
employees.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
nea
ran
a
placement
service
for
its
members
and
charged
a
fee?
i
suppose
it
may
be
a
different
case
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
a
profitmaking
operation
even
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
employment
agencies
normally
do.
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
ftc
conclude
as
to
what
the
violation
was?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
but
in
terms
of
its
charter,
this
is
an
unfair
trade
practice?
unknown
speaker
because
it
violated
some
antitrust
law.
unknown
speaker
and
what
business
was
that
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
terms
of
the
ftc
act,
the
federal
trade
commission
act?
unknown
speaker
that's
strictly
a
construct
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
unknown
speaker
are
you
in
the
white
volume
now?
unknown
speaker
you're
right.
75a.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
date
of
that,
"what
has
the
ama
done
for
you
lately?
"
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
had
the
'81
they
would
probably
say
what
we've
done
for
you
lately
is
to
repeal
our
advertising
restrictions.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
the
business
of
why
would
you
insist
that
the
ama
take
responsibility
for
what's
going
on
in
the
states?
unknown
speaker
rather
than
focusing
under
a
w.t.
grant
standard
on
the
ama
itself,
which
i
take
it
the
ftc
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
people
can
certainly
differ
over
whether
an
injunction
or
a
cease
and
desist
order
is
appropriate
after
the
illegality
has
presumably
terminated.
unknown
speaker
but
people
can
differ
over
whether
that
risk
is
present.
unknown
speaker
witness
the
split
in
the
court
below.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
contest
except
on
jurisdictional
grounds
their
conclusion
on
liability
as
of
1975?
unknown
speaker
as
of
1975,
the
date
of
filing
the
complaint.
do
you
challenge
that
other
than
on
jurisdictional
grounds?
unknown
speaker
well,
nevertheless,
they
filed
the
complaint.
as
of
the
date
of
the
complaint
do
you
challenge
the
finding
of
liability?
unknown
speaker
mr.
minow,
i
hate
to
go
back
to
the
contract
medicine,
but
it
was
clear
that
that
aspect
of
the
profession
was
always
subject
to
antitrust
laws,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
issue
with
finding
146
with
respect
to
the
opinions
and
reports
that
were
unfair
and
unethical
as
of
1971?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
not
agree
that
that
described
illegal
conduct?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
quoted
in
a
1971
report.
finding
146
on
page
228a
of
the
appendix.
"the
1971
ama
judicial
counsel's
opinions
and
reports
provide
the
following
with
respect
to
contract
medicine:
a)
when
the
compensation
received
is
inadequate
based
on
the
usual
fees
paid
for
the
same
kind
of
service
and
class
of
people
in
the
same
community.
"
that
was
in
effect
at
that
time,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
when
a
reasonable
degree
of
free
choice
of
physicians
is
denied
those
cared
for
in
a
community
where
other
competent
physicians
are
readily
available,
this
relates
to
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
it
was
perfectly
clear
it
was
fair
to
assume
pre-goldfarb
that
these
were
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
at
all.
the
contract--
unknown
speaker
--the
contractual
arrangement
aspect
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
oregon
state
medical
society
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
was
an
understanding
that
the
society
was
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
no
remedy
was
necessary
because
they
had
abandoned
the
practice.
