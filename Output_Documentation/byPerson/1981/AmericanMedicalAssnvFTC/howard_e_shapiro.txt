mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
federal
trade
commission,
acting
under
section
5
of
the
ftc
act,
found
a
continuing
nationwide
private
agreement
in
restraint
of
trade
among
ama
and
its
affiliates
and
its
members.
this
agreement
was
effectuated
by
certain
ethical
restraints.
the
restraints
on
which
the
commission
focused
were
in
effect
at
the
time
the
commission
filed
its
complaint
in
december
1975.
they
almost
totally
banned
advertising
by
physicians,
and
they
protected
traditional
fee-for-service
practice
from
competition
by
alternative
contract
arrangements
of
physicians.
so
we
dealt
with
advertising
and
what
is
usually
denominated
by
the
american
medical
association
as
contract
practice.
now,
the
commission
entered
a
cease
and
desist
order
designed
to
eliminate
the
conspiracy,
which
was
nationwide,
and
its
effects
throughout
the
nation.
the
order
was
intended
to
leave
physicians
free
to
choose
whether
and
how
and
with
whom
they
will
make
contractual
arrangements
for
their
services
and
whether
and
how
they
will
compete
through
nondeceptive
advertising.
it
was
intended
to
open
the
previously
blocked
flow
of
information
needed
by
consumers
seeking
access
to
the
market
for
medical
services,
for
i
emphasize
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
market.
now,
the
commission
also
found
that
because
advertising
in
the
medical
context
involves
public
interest
considerations
sharply
different
from
those
applicable
in
the
ordinary
commercial
context
that
the
american
medical
association
and
similar
organizations
may
and
should
continue
through
ethical
standards
to
police
false
or
deceptive
or
oppressive
advertising
by
physicians.
the
issues
that
my
brother
has
discussed
with
you
are
two.
first,
does
the
commission
have
jurisdiction
over
ama
under
section
4
of
the
ftc
act;
that
is,
is
the
american
medical
association
a
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
and
should
the
commission
have
terminated
the
case
after
ama
began
to
make
changes
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
now,
the
only
matters
before
the
commission
when
that
occurred
are
ama's
statements
in
april
1976
dealing
with
advertising,
and
its
march
1977
revision
of
its
opinions
and
reports.
i
think
that
i
should
touch
a
bit
on
the
chronology
because
i
think
it's
important.
the
april
1976
statement
was
not
an
abstract
new
piece
of
writing.
the
ama
was
very
careful
in
drafting
that
statement
to
assert
that
it
was
reaffirming
its
prior
position
on
advertising.
moreover,
the
commission...
all
this
is
in
the
findings,
incidentally...
the
commission
found
that
this
april
1976
statement
and
the
march
1977
version
of
it
reflected
a
very
close
link
to
the
previous
restrictions.
the
statements
did
not
contain
any
express
recision
of
what
had
gone
before.
there
is
no
statement
in
this
record
in
which
ama
tells
the
affiliates,
who
are
the
means
by
which
this
conspiracy
is
enforced,
that
they
are
to
disregard
the
previous
restrictions.
it
doesn't
even
identify
what
they
are
to
disregard.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
we
have
had
some
difficulty
identifying
precisely
what
was
eliminated.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
was
so
highly
ambiguous
that
it
is
unclear
whether
there
was
a
change
or
not.
the
commission
ultimately
concluded
that
there
had
not
been
any
really
clear,
unambiguous
abandonment
of
the
conspiracy.
this
was
reflected
in
other
findings.
for
example,
in
the
very
statements
which
ama
says
today
represented
a
change,
it
was
also
saying
that
local
societies
could
have
restrictions
that
exceed
anything
that
ama
had
in
its
current
principles
of
ethics
with
respect
to
advertising.
it
left
the
ban
against
solicitation
in
the
principles
of
ethics
unchanged.
ama's
own
witnesses
who
were
put
on
in
surrebuttal
to
explain
its
current
position
on
advertising...
and
this
included
the
chairman
of
its
board
of
trustees,
a
members
of
its
house
of
delegates,
chairman
of
the
section
on
medical
schools...
each
seemed
to
be
stating
positions
that
were
clearly
reflected
in
what
had
gone
before.
moreover,
and
perhaps
most
important
given
the
fact
that
we
are
concerned
with
dissipating
the
effects
of
a
conspiracy,
the
evidence
before
the
commission
indicated
that
even
after
ama's
march
1976
statements
the
old
restrictions
were
being
applied
by
ama's
affiliates
in
numerous
circumstances,
ranging
from
one
of
the
connecticut
petitioner's
warnings
to
an
ophthalmologist
who
had
benefitted
from
some
newspaper
publicity
to
the
maryland
medical
society's
published
ethical
guide,
based
on
ama
standards,
which
condemned
advertising--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
there
was,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
interesting
things.
in
the
record
you
will
find,
in
the
findings--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
that
was
their
position
at
times.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
wording
of
their
position
has
changed
considerably,
i
must
say.
we
have
outlined
in
the
brief
and
the
commission
has
outlined
in
its
findings
positions
by
the
ftc
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
all
advertising
was
bad,
that
all
solicitation
includes
advertising.
and
then
there
would
be
a
slight
shift
because
they
would
allow
obviously
some
of
the
simplest
forms
of
advertising...
a
card,
a
sign,
an
official
directory.
so
that
the
commission's
finding
on
this
matter
is
that
the
ama's
abandonment
was
highly
ambiguous.
in
fact,
how
ambiguous
can
best
be
seen,
i
think,
by
looking
at
something
that
ama
has
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
although
it's
extra-record,
in
january
of
1980
they
finally
abolished
the
ban
on
solicitation
entirely
from
their
principles
of
ethics,
july
of
1980,
and
in
january
of
1981
they
issued
a
complete
new
edition
of
the
opinions
and
reports
which
very
clearly
seems
to
be
an
effort
to
come
into
conformity
with
the
law
by
providing
that
doctors
can
advertise
as
long
as
it's
not
misleading,
or
false,
or
deceptive,
or
oppressive.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
there
was
a
total--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
yes,
i
think
so
in
this
way.
certainly
the
voluntary
association
is
not,
of
course
subject
to
the
first
amendment
itself,
but
the
voluntary
association
if
it's
an
association
of
entrepreneurs
i
subject
to
the
requirement
that
it
not
suppress
competition
or
restrain
trade
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
announcement
is
certainly
something
that
is
within
the
first
amendment,
but
if
those
words
are
words
that
as
implemented
add
up
to
a
restraint
of
trade...
and
that
is
what
we
have
here,
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade...
through
the
application
of
these
restrictions--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
announcement
of
ethical
standards
would
be
within
the
first
amendment.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
goldfarb
and
bates,
although
bates,
of
course,
involves
a
slightly
different
issue,
but
goldfarb
and
bates
clearly
indicate
that
one
cannot
under
the
guise
of
exercising
first
amendment
rights
restrain
trade.
now,
we
have--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
an
agreement--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--exactly.
it
brings
us
back
to
professional
engineers,
your
honor,
that
restraints
of
trade--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
if
the
announcement
of
the
code
carries
with
it
the
effects
of
a
restraint
of
trade,
then
using
the
central
hudson
analysis
that
unlawful
speech
or
speech
in
aid
of
unlawful
activity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
then
we
would
have
to
say
that
the
restraint
of
trade
takes
the
conduct
and
the
utterances
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
first
amendment
was
invoked
before
the
commission
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
in
the
second
circuit,
but
only
in
connection
with
challenges
to
the
order.
moreover,
and
i
think
i
come
back
to
the
central
hudson
analysis
on
this,
restraints
on
competition
are
always
affected
through
speech
and
writings.
that
speech,
as
i've
said,
is
unlawful.
the
government
interest
in
suppressing
it
is
substantial
within
the
meaning
of
central
hudson,
and
reasonable
restrictions
advance
that
substantial
interest
within
the
meaning
of
central
hudson.
if
it's
reasonably
related
to
the
violation,
then
i
think
remedial
restraints
on
that
speech
are
deemed
to
be
no
more
extensive
than
necessary.
you
can't
quite
make
a
central
hudson
analysis
if
you're
trying
to
deal
with
a
remedy
for
unlawful
conduct.
that's
our
essential
position
on
the
first
amendment.
now,
there's
much
debate
about
what
the
commission
did
or
said
with
respect
to
ama's
changes
here.
what
the
commission
did
was
to
examine
the
changes
very
closely
under
the
standards
mentioned
by
justice
rehnquist,
the
w.t.
grant
standards.
in
fact,
ama's
argued
before
this
court
and
before
the
commission
that
we
couldn't
even
do
that,
that
we
had
to
judge
their
liability
on
their
post-complaint
changes.
i
know
of
no
case
that
says
that.
the
oregon
medical
society,
which
my
brother
invokes,
doesn't
support
it.
the
commission
examined
the
conduct
alleged
in
the
complaint,
found
a
violation,
and
looked
to
see
the
relationship
between
that
conduct
and
the
post-complaint
changes.
what
it
was
concerned
with
was
three
questions,
once
it
had
found
this
nationwide
conspiracy
which
the
evidence
showed
had
gone
on
with
the
continued
enforcement
of
the
old
standards.
it
looked
first
to
see
whether
the
post-complaint
changes
by
ama
would
dissipate
the
effects
o
the
conspiracy,
because
that,
after
all,
is
the
first
concern
of
any
remedy
in
a
conspiracy
case.
the
second
question
was
whether
the
post-complaint
changes
reflected
a
clear
and
unambiguous
abandonment
of
the
conspiracy,
not
only
by
ama
but
by
the
other
members,
because
the
conspiracy
was
between
ama
and
its
federated
affiliates.
and
finally,
the
commission
had
to
consider
whether
there
was
a
cognizable
danger
of
recurrence.
this
kind
of
analysis
is
essentially
what
i
think
is
implied
in
two
categories
of
cases:
first,
the
line
of
cases
reflected,
for
example,
in
ftc
against
colgate
concerning
the
commission's
remedial
responsibilities
and
discretion;
and
secondly,
the
line
of
cases
reflected
in
w.t.
grant
and
cases
in
that
line.
the
issues
thus
never
went
to
ama's
post-complaint...
i
mean
the
issue
about
ama's
post-complaint
changes
didn't
go
to
its
liability;
they
went
rather
to
the
appropriateness
under
the
public
interest
of
a
remedy.
now,
the
commission
examined
at
length
that
question.
it
found
that
ama's
changes
simply
did
not
meet
these
tests.
the
record,
i
think,
can
be
examined.
i
won't
take
up
the
court's
time
with
details
further.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
has
been
its
general
practice.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
in
antitrust
cases.
occasionally
one
allows
evidence
in
up
to
the
date
of
trial.
but
that
second
question--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--is
remedy.
and
that's
how
the
ftc
approached
it
here.
it
could
very
well
have
found
that
on
a
different
showing
of
change
the
case
might
have
not
warranted
a
remedy.
i
must
say
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
one
aspect
of
the
commission's
order,
because
i
think
it's
important.
section
4
of
the
commission's
order,
which
i
think
you'll
find
it
about
page
371
of
petitioner's
appendix,
section
4
is
designed
to
achieve
compliance,
and
what
it
focuses
on
is
a
requirement
that
ama
change
its
ethical
standards
to
comply
with
the
order
to
get
rid
of
the
restrictions.
all
right.
ama
says
at
least
by
july
of...
by
january
of
1981
it
has
done
that.
it
also
requires
that
steps
be
taken
to
assure
that
the
affiliates
agree
to
obey
the
order.
and
finally,
that
ama
take
steps
to
police
the
order
and
disaffiliate
anyone
who
does
not
comply.
that
is
really
the
concern
of
the
commission
when
it
addresses
the
abandonment
issue.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
was
bringing
the
court's
attention
to
the
petitioner's
appendix,
the
white,
thick
book.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
at
371,
which
dealt
with
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
order.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
the
remainder
of
my
time
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
the
commission's
finding
here.
an
absolute
ban
by
members
of
a
profession,
an
entrepreneurial
profession--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--that
would
be
a
violation
of
law,
because
as
in
the
engineers
case,
it
is
a
prohibition
against
engaging
in
competitive
conduct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
that
they're
quite
close
in
the
sense
that
advertising
is
an
offering
of
services,
and
you're
sort
of
pledging
i
will
never
make
certain
public
announcements
of
my
availability.
the
market
aspects
of
a
profession...
and
that's
all
that
the
commission
is
interested
in,
not
the
doctor-patient
relationship
obviously...
the
market
aspects
of
a
profession,
the
commercial
aspects
of
a
profession
are
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws,
as
in
engineers;
and
that
is
what
the
commission
was
addressing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
a
very
small
number--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--twenty.
i
think
that--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
the
essence
of
the
violation
is
the
agreement
not
to
advertise.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
that
would
be
a
violation
within...
under
the
rule
of
reason,
i
might
add,
if
someone
can
come
up
with
justification,
advertising
in
a
professional
context
is
always
assessed
under
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
there's
no
agreement
then,
no
agreement.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
two
is...
if
it
involves
an
agreement--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--not
to
advertise,
it's
an
agreement
not
to
compete,
and
an
agreement
not
to
compete
is
an
agreement
under
restraint
of
trade.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
firm
is
an
integration
of
competitive
functions.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
your
honor?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
actually
i
can't
really
go
further
than
the
commission,
which
did
involve
a
nationwide
conspiracy.
let
me
turn--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--no,
because
law
firm
partnerships--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--it's
not
the
voluntary
association
that's
the
essence
of
it;
it's
the
integration
of
competitive
functions
to
achieve
a
more
competitive
function.
a
law
firm
is--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--like
a
corporation
or
like
the
musical
copyright
groups
that
combine
and
in
effect
enhance
competition
through
their
combination.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
jurisdictional
question
very
briefly.
the
commission's
holding
on
jurisdiction
is
relatively
easily
stated.
first,
the
commission
does
not
claim
broad
jurisdiction
over
nonprofit
associations.
it
claims
jurisdiction
over
nonprofit
associations
made
up
of
entrepreneurs
when
those
associations
are
engaged
in
substantial
part
in
operating
for
the
profit
of
those
entrepreneur
members.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
holding.
what
the
commission
has
said
is
that
if
you
look
at
ama
you
will
find
that
it
is
engaged
in
many
praiseworthy
noncommercial
activities
of
all
kinds,
but
you
will
also
find
that
in
many
respects
it
functions
like
a
trade
association.
the
findings
of
the
commission
were
that
the
bulk
of
ama's
members
are
engaged
in
the
profit-motivated
private
practice
of
medicine,
in
the
traditional
practice
of
medicine,
fee-for-service
medicine.
in
short,
doctors
are
in
that
aspect
of
their
practice
like
any
other
entrepreneurs.
they're
entrepreneurs
operating
for
their
own
account.
when
you
combine
persons
together
into
an
association,
the
association
may
be
a
nonprofit
organization
like
any
other
trade
association,
but
if
it's
acting
for
the
profit
of
those
members
in
part,
in
substantial
part,
then
we
think
that
it
fits
within
the
definition
of
a
corporation
in
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
such
an
association
would
not
be
an
association
of
persons
engaged
in
entrepreneurial
functions,
in
for
profit
functions.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
don't
operate
for
profit
in
the
same...
i
don't
know
the
association.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
they--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--they
may
indeed
be
interested.
in
fact,
there
are
many,
many
associations
which
are
concerned
with
the
economic
interest
of
one--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--i
would
not
include
the
ministers.
i
would
not--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--similarly.
schoolteachers
are
typically
employees,
and
there's
a
difference.
i
could
use
a
hypothetical--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--the
national
education
association?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--they
are,
and
that
brings
me
to
my
hypothetical.
if
you
approach
a
union,
which
is
a
group
of
people
combined
together
in
economic
interest
but
the
union
member
is
an
employee,
he
is
not
an
entrepreneur
for
profit.
congress
chose
that
word
ftc's
jurisdiction
to
the
type
of
organization
which
involves
those
people
who
are
entrepreneurs
for
profit.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
a
very
broad,
nontechnical
sense,
yes.
but
the
commission
has
accepted--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--no.
i
think
i've
drawn...
i've
attempted;
i
haven't
yet...
drawn
a
line
between
profit
in
the
sense
of
somebody
who
is
engaged
in
business
to
gain
income
over
costs,
revenue
over
costs,
which
all
doctors
have
to
do
when
they're
operating
their
office
practices
and
their
fee-for-service
practices,
as
distinguished
from
the
employee
or
the
schoolteacher--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--it
comes
closer
to
that
than
a
guild
or
a
trade
association,
which
in
some
of
its
functions,
not
all,
ama
approaches.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
other
limit
on
the
commission's
jurisdiction
here.
the
limitation
is
one
which
focuses
on
the
commercial
aspects,
the
entrepreneurial
aspects
of
the
membership;
and
it
also
focuses
very
closely
on
substantiality.
obviously,
there
are
all
kinds
of
charitable
organizations
which
have
incidental
commercial
function...
we
have
to
concede
that...
whether
it's
raising
money
through
selling
something
or
what
have
you.
but
if
it's
incidental,
then
as
the
commission
has
said
in
its
opinion,
as
the
eighth
circuit
indicated
in
the
community
blood
bank
case,
which
we
think
the
commission's
opinion
is
consistent--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--it
may
be
incidental.
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--it
might
be.
and
if
it's
a
substantial
activity
that
impacts
on
the
marketplace
substantially--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--then
that
activity,
that
aspect
might
bring,
might
come
within
it.
it
depends
on
substantiality.
there
are
a
whole
range
of
indicia
that
have
to
be
looked
at.
i
mean
it's
not
an
automatic
or
simple
test.
the
commission's
test
has
essentially
been
one
of
looking
to
a
number
of
factors.
it
looks
to
the
origin
of
the
organization,
it
looks
to
its
statement
of
purposes,
it
looks
to
the
members'
relationship
to
profit-motivated
activities,
it
looks
to
publications,
it
looks
to
a
whole
range
of
functions.
i--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--in
this
case?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
violation
was
twofold.
one
was
a
violation
of
the
prohibition
against
totally
banning
advertising,
and
the
other
was
a
violation
against
restricting
contract
practice.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
the
ftc
found
an
unfair
trade
practice...
well,
no.
i'm
sorry.
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it's
twofold.
there
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
finding
based
on
the
antitrust
laws,
and
the
commission
also
found
some
consumer
injury
because
the
advertising
cutoff
cut
off
consumers
from
valuable
information
concerning--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--it
was
unfair
method
of
competition
with
respect
to
the
suppression
of
advertising
in
the
contract
practice,
and
an
unfair
practice
with
respect
to
consumer
injury
in
denying
consumers
access
to
needed
information
as
to
how
to--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--that's
the
way
the
commission
has
construed
its
statute.
the
record
on
jurisdiction
is
quite
lengthy.
i
shall
have
to
contradict
my
brother
on
his
suggestion
that
the
commission
said
the
budgetary
analysis
was
proper.
that
was
precisely
what
it
rejected.
what
it
said
was
you
look
to
the
actual
activities
of
the
association.
and
a
quick,
short
way
of
getting
an
idea
of
what
the
ama
is
about
in
its
commercial
aspects
is
at
page,
i
think
it's--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--i'm
in
the
white
volume.
i
believe
it's
75a.
well,
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
way
within
the
document.
but
it's
a
document
which
simply
says
"what's
the
ama
done
for
you
lately?
"
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
i
won't
go
through
it
step
by
step,
but
i
think
that
a
quick
glance
at
it
will
enumerate
listings
ranging
from
things
ama
has
done
to
enhance
the
productivity
of
practice
to
things
ama
has
done
to
cut
down
the
competition
of
competing
health
maintenance
organizations.
and
these
are
the
kinds
of
indicia
that
the
commission
went
through
very
carefully
and
at
great
length.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
that
was
1975.
there
is,
however,
a
1976
statement
made
in
december
1976--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
they
have
moved
on
that
certainly,
and
we
welcome
what
they
have
done
as
of
'81.
the
problem
is
what's
happening
out
with
the
rest
of
the
country.
if
the
old
standards
are
still
continuing--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--well,
in
answer--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
--we
did
focus
on
it,
but
we
do
have
a
remedial
responsibility.
now,
if
the
local
affiliates
are
as
independent
in
ethical
matters
as
ama
claims,
not
only
is
our
uncontested
finding
of
conspiracy
wrong,
but
then
it's
merely
a
matter
of...
then
its
mere
publication
of
modified
statements
won't
dissolve
the
conspiracy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
affiliates
can
be
expected
to
adhere
to
ama's
published
statements,
then
ama
shouldn't
be
denying
responsibility
for
correcting
the
effects
of
the
conspiracy.
thank
you,
your
honor.
