mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
justice
stevens'
question
because
i
think
that
question
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
the
only
thing
that
is
different,
if
anything
is
different,
about
these
contractors
compared
to
the
contractors
in
the
kern-limerick
case
or
king
&
boozer
is
that
they
get
their
money
up
front
instead
of
after
the
fact.
when
you
read
particularly
the
reply
brief
of
the
united
states,
it
is
clear
that
that
is
all
that
they
are
saying.
now,
the
benchmark
i
believe
that
would
assist
in
analyzing
the
contractors
today
is
the
boyd
case,
the
case
that
this
court
considered.
it
is
true
that
there
a
use
tax
was
being
considered
rather
than
a
gross
receipts
tax.
but
principles
were
enunciated
in
that
case
which
indicate
that
this
court
has
already
scrutinized
standard
management
contractors
and
said
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
contract
with
the
united
states,
the
fact
that
they
operate
in
a
government
facility,
use
advance
funds,
have
a
complete
absence
of
risk
as
a
result
of
advanced
funding,
undertake
important
federal
duties,
have
the
title
to
their
purchases
passed
to
the
united
states,
that
all
of
this
is
simply
symptomatic
of
government
contracting.
it
does
not
create
agents,
it
does
not
create
instrumentalities.
an
important
concession
found
at
page
201
of
the
appendix
is
the
concession
by
the
united
states,
which
i
think
is
proper
following
the
boyd
decision,
that
these
contractors
are
not
instrumentalities.
now,
i'm
never
sure
what
an
instrumentality
is,
but
in
some
way
i
read
that
to
mean
that
the
mere
fact
of
a
contractual
association
is
not
enough
to
make
you
an
agent.
advanced
funding
was
used
from
the
beginning
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
it
was
used
at
the
time
this
court
decided
roane-anderson,
it
is
continued
to
be
used
after
congress
legislatively
reversed
the
roane-anderson
case.
the
united
states
is
simply
selecting
one
contractual
element
of
the
relationship
and
after
the
fact
reading
in
great
significance.
there
is
really
no
difference,
as
shown
by
the
history
of
advance
funding
within
the
atomic
energy
commission.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
transcript
the
fact
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
always
viewed
these
contractors
as
cost
plus
contractors.
this
court
in
boyd
called
them
cost
plus
contractors,
even
though
they
were
getting
advanced
funding.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
no,
that
is
correct,
justice
white,
and
in
the
fourth
part
of
our
brief
we
discuss
at
some
length
the
benefits
that
accrue
to
sandia.
i
believe
justice
brennan
pointed
out
licenses,
payments
effectively
of
overhead
to
western
electric,
totaling
some
$300,000
in
the
year
in
which
the
interrogatory
was
responded
to.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
they
might,
indeed,
justice
burger,
and
basically,
it's
important
to
remember,
i
believe,
that
sandia,
although
it
was
created
to
undertake
these
contracts,
was
created,
if
you'll
pardon
the
colloquial
expression,
by
the
telephone
company.
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
the
telephone
company
is
the
government
of
the
united
states,
but
that
is
only
in
jest.
route
128
around
boston,
silicone
valley
in
san
francisco,
is
surrounded
by
companies
that
are
created
to
work
for
the
government,
that
only
exist
to
work
for
the
government.
the
real
comparison,
i
believe,
is
with
the
corporations
that
the
united
states
did
set
up
in
world
war
ii
to
build
ships,
to
build
munitions.
there
were
reasons
why
the
united
states
has
chosen
to
go
the
private
route.
and
as
justice
brennan
asked
about
gogco
plants,
government
owned,
contractor
operated,
i
believe
the
michigan
property
cases
are
decisions
by
this
court
recognizing
that
even
though
you
are
working
in
a
government
facility,
using
government
property,
you're
still
subject
to
taxes.
i
think
what
the
united
states
confuses
in
looking
at
advance
funding
is
the
difference
between
absence
of
risk,
which
i
say
is
endemic
to
government
contracting.
if
you're
on
cost
plus,
whether
you
get
paid
in
advance
or
get
paid
after,
unless
you're
taking
vacations
in
tahiti
with
the
money,
there
is
no
risk.
what
the
government
is
confusing
is
the
absence
of
risk
compared
to
who
has
the
obligation.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
i
believe
that
the
risk
of
loss
becomes
simply
an
element
of
the
cost
plus
contract--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--well,
in
the
case
of
sandia
i
believe
that
absent
malfeasance,--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
sandia
has
a
slightly
higher
threshold
of
responsibility.
there
is
still
written
into
the
contract
that
if
there
is
malfeasance
at
a
high
enough
level,
that
again
there
will
be
responsibility
in
that
sense,
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
yes,
but
again,
i
think
it's
hard
to
show
negligence
in
normal
government
contracting,
also.
i
don't
think
that
contractors
get
burned
very
often.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
no.
i
think
that
it
is
established
in
the
case
law,
justice
o'connor,
that
although
a
state
is
free
to
tax
a
government
contractor,
it
may
not
seize
property
of
the
united
states,
it
may
not
levy
against
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
apparently
not.
and
an
example
that
i
would
give
you
is
in
the
boyd
case,
after
the
decision
in
boyd
by
this
court
that
the
boyd
contractor
was
subject
to
property
taxes,
it
was
paid
from
advance
funding.
and
i've
cited
in
my
brief
from
the
pleadings
in
that
case
indicating
that
it
was
the
contractor
who
paid
the
tax,
but
he
paid
it
with
advance
funding.
the
important
point
i
believe
from
that
illustration
is
that
it
was
the
contractor's
obligation
to
pay
the
tax;
he
was
the
one
that
was
liable.
and
turning
to
a
question
that
was
asked,
similarly
with
the
employees.
and
remember
there
are
7000
employees
of
these
contractors,
only
160
of
whom
are
involved
in
procurement,
meaning
transactions
with
third
parties.
fifty-eight
percent
of
all
these
contractors'
receipts
are
not
in
that
classic
agent
relationship
of
dealing
with
third
parties;
58
%
are
simply
to
meet
the
payroll.
and
we
are
in
a
situation
in
which
the
united
states
has
conceded
they
are
not
instrumentalities;
we
are
not
liable
for
their
torts,
we
don't
want
to
be
involved
in
their
labor
relations;
we
conceived
that
the
contractors
are
independent
contractors
in
hiring
and
supervising
these
employees,
and
yet
when
the
taxman
comes
calling,
suddenly
as
the
reply
brief
says,
they
are
simply
independent
contractors
working
for
a
fee
for
the
zia
company
or
for
sandia.
this
to
me
strains
the
concept
of
employee
greatly.
the
united
states
has
made
so
many
concessions
in
this
case
about
its
relationship
vis
a
vis
the
contractors'
employees
that
there
is
no
way
of
finding
that
the
contractors'
7000
employees
in
some
way
have
a
direct
contractual
relationship
with
the
united
states.
true,
advanced
funding
is
used
to
meet
the
payroll,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
the
united
states'
obligation
to
pay
those
employees
or
is
it
the
contractor's?
i
think
the
distinction
has
to
be
that
under
these
contracts,
as
under
any
cost
plus
contract,
it
is
the
united
states
that
has
an
obligation
to
sandia,
zia
and
laci
to
pay
them.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
your
honor,
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
mcgrath,
the
treasury
department
representative,
he
says
that
there
is
no
way
that
a
third
party
can
go
against
the
letter
of
credit,
can
go
against
the
federal
reserve
bank,
can
go
against
the--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--i
think
that
he
has
to
sue
the
contractor.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
i
assume
that
there
are
various
mechanisms
for
end-running
the
process,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
frankly,--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
sir.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
i
think
that
is
indicated
under
the
purchase
documents--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--i
am
sorry
i
am
not
familiar
with
procedure
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
so
my
answer
is--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--there
is
not,
mr.
justice
white.
and
looking
at
page,
for
example,--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--at
page
120
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
clear
distinction
drawn
between
the
zia
company
as
the
buyer.
it
is
defined
in
the
purchase
documents
as
the
buyer,
and
indeed,
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
concedes;
they
call
it
the
nominal
buyer,
i
say
it's
the
buyer
and
that's
what
the
purchase--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--it
has
no
authority
any
different
from
that
of
any
other
cost
plus
contractor.
i
do
not
understand
them
to
have
that.
as
i
indicate,
by
the
concessions
in
this
case,
there
is
no
direct
claim
between
the
contractors'
employees
and
the
united
states,
so
that
is
one
segment
of
these
receipts.
in
dealing
with
third
parties,
the
contractors
are
required
to
order
in
their
own
names.
the
purchase
documents
indicate
that
the
purchase
orders
could
be
assigned
to
the
united
states,
which
to
me
indicates
that
they
are
not
parties
to
that
purchase,
but
discovery
reveals
that
they
never
are
assigned.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
in
other
jurisdictions,
as
discussed
in
our
brief
i
believe
in
the
footnote
at
page
16,
the
atomic
energy
commission
deliberately
structured
transactions
in
a
totally
different
way
from
these
transactions.
it
had
the
purchase
orders
assigned
to
it,
it
made
payments
directly
to
the
vendors.
it
was
done
deliberately
to
avoid
taxes.
the
fact
that
those
procedures
have
been
viewed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
a
means
of
avoiding
state
taxes
strongly
suggests
that
the
mere
contractual
interplay
that
is
at
issue
here
does
not
amount
to
the
same
relationship.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
justice
stevens,
this
was
done
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
did
find
that
the
contractor
was
an
agent
in
all
respects,
based
on
the
contract
documents
and
exhibits,
none
of
which
was
controverted.
the
tenth
circuit
reversed.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
but
also,
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
given
all
the
concessions
in
regard
to
the
relationship
with
the
contractor's
employees,
given
the
fact
that
the
contractors
were
contractually
required
to
order
in
their
own
name,
contractually
required
to
use
purchase
forms
that
said
zia
is
the
buyer,
not
the
united
states,
militated
the
conclusion
that
the
contractors
were
the
only
parties
that
were
obligated
to
the
vendors.
i
agree
that
it
is
easier
to
find
agency
in
the
relationship
with
third
parties.
that
is
the
classic
agent
use
of
an
agent.
and
therefore,
also,
that
the
relationship
with
the
employees
is
far
more
clearly
a
non-agent
relationship,
particularly
given
the
concession
that
these
contractors
are
not
instrumentalities.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
it
does,
justice
white,
but--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--justice
white,
the
united
states
has
advanced
no
claims
in
this
case
in
the
record
or
elsewhere;
they
have
purely
argued
that
advanced
funding
equal
the
relationship.
they
have
not
brought
in
examples
of
litigation
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
the
boyd
contractor
in
the
boyd
case
also
involving
these
same
atomic
energy
commission
contractors,
title
to
the
purchase
is
passed
to
the
united
states.
that
was
true
in
the
kern-limerick
case,
it
was
true
in
the
alabama
v.
king
&
boozer
case.
i
believe
that
what
this
court
has
consistently
said
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
title
is
passed,
and
the
mere
fact
that
contractors
in
some
loose
and
general
sense
are
operating
for
the
government,
or
acting
as
agents
for
the
government...
and
this
is
from
the
alabama
v.
king
&
boozer
case...
does
not
amount
to
an
agency
relationship.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
that
is
correct,
justice
white,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
what
was
said
in
the
opinion
in
boyd.
that
the
government
knows
how
to
make
agents,
it
knows
how
to
use
its
own
employees;
if
it
wants
to,
let
it
go
ahead.
that
is
the
same
contractors
as
we
are
dealing
with
here.
yet,
it
is
only
two
years
into
the
case,
and
i'm
a
trial
lawyer.
in
a
contract
case,
if
somebody
starts
changing
his
contracts
in
the
middle
of
the
case,
i
start
thinking
maybe
he
had
a
weak
case.
and
even
these
contract
modifications
are
still
reluctant
to
come
out
and
say
flat
out,
i
am
designating
you
as
an
agent.
our
brief
in
the
first
section
discusses
at
great
length
documentation
of
the
atomic
energy
commission's
reluctance,
its
fear
about
designating
its
contractors
as
agents,
its
fear
that
they
will
become
enmeshed
in
exactly
the
sort
of
red
tape
that
leads
the
government
in
the
first
place
to
use
private
companies.
obviously,
the
government
has,
on
other
occasions,
created
instrumentalities,
on
other
occasions
it
has
created
corporations.
yet
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
federal
contracting.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
because
of
the
factual
difference
between
this
case
and
that
one.
there,
the
atomic
energy
commission,
following
roane-anderson,
had
gone
back
and
rewritten
its
purchase
documents
to
say
nothing
herein
shall
preclude
direct
liability
of
the
united
states
to
the
third
parties.
so
there
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
taking
the
standard
contract
form
which
is
supposed
to
have
such
magic
and
putting
in
much
stronger
language
in
order
to
make
sure
that
that
happened.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
yes,
and
certainly
in
regard
to
the
employees,
justice
stevens.
it
is
unlike
the
kern-limerick
case,
unlike
the
boyd
case.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
yes.
i'm
saying
that
unlike
other
cases,
the
kern-limerick
case
purely
involved
a
relationship
between
a
contractor
and
a
third
party
supplier.
in
this
case,
42
%
of
the
receipts
relate
to
that
sort
of
transaction;
58
%
of
the
receipts
are
simply
meeting
the
internal
payroll
of
sandia,
zia
and
laci.
and
again,
as
to
those
relationships,
the
government
has
disclaimed
a
direct
relationship
with
the
contractors'
employees.
the
united
states
in
its
reply
brief
i
think
gives
a
strained
interpretation.
if
the
government
says,
in
regard
to
the
contract...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
no.
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
it
is
on
the
receipts
of
the
contractors,
and
the
question
is
what
did
they
do,
what
kind
of
transactions
did
those
receipts
relate
to.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
the
contractor
draws
from
the
united
states
funds
sufficient
to
meet
its
payrolls,
sufficient
to
pay
its
vendor.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
that
is
right,
because
it
is
a
gross
receipts
tax.
i
run
a
law
firm;
my
law
firm
pays...
i
pay
4
%
on
all
my
fees
even
though
much
of
it
goes
for
internal
costs.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
absolutely
correct,
justice
burger.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
i
forget
the
number,
it's
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
7000
employees.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
at
page
25
of
the
u.s.'s
brief,
it
is
conceded
that
absent
the
finding
of
an
agency
relationship,
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
is
on
the
contractor,
not
on
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
no.
the
contractor
pays
the
tax
based
on
what
he
has
received
from
the
united
states.
in
transactions
in
which
there
is
also
dealing
with
a
second
party
in
the
chain,
there
is
a
system
of
non-taxable
transactions.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
he
will
pay
a
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
no.
if
they
are
not
agents
he
will
pay
that
tax.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
appreciate
the
correction,
and
let
me
explain
it.
i'm
saying...
there
are
non-taxable
transaction
certificates
made
available
to
insulate
one
of
those
levels
of
transaction.
perhaps
that--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--because
he
will
have
given
a
resale
certificate.
that
is
still...
in
new
mexico
we
have
already
litigated
against
white
sands
missile
range
contractors,
air
force
contractors,
various
civilian
agency
contractors.
we
are
negotiating
with
them
to
work
out
precisely
those
transactions
so
that
we
can
give
them
the
non-taxable
certificates.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
underlying
the
court's
concern
in
this
area
is
the
need
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
needs
of
the
states
for
revenue
and
the
need
to
protect
the
united
states
from
affronts
to
its
supremacy.
i
think
what
distinguishes
this
type
of
case
from
the
type
of
case
in
which
there
really
is
an
attempt
to
tax
the
united
states
is
that
here
the
affront
is,
in
effect,
self-created
by
the
united
states.
if
the
tax
burden
is
too
onerous,
that
is
for
congress
to
adjust,
if
the
amount
is
too
great.
as
this
court
has
said
in
other
recent
cases.
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
contract
drafting
by
a
federal
contracting
officer
designed
to
assure
that
there
will
be
an
affront
to
the
supremacy
of
the
united
states.
and
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
kern-limerick
case
and
the
underlying
james
v.
dravo
case,
which
established
the
general
rule
that
federal
contractors
are
liable
for
state
taxes,
the
arbiter
of
this
balance
between
the
state's
needs
and
the
federal
interests
lies
in
the
hands
of
individual
contracting
officers.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
absolutely
not,
justice
white.
because--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--exactly,
that
is
right.
there
is
no
need
to...
we
rely
on
boyd,
and
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
kern-limerick
case
is
that
kern-limerick
dealt
exclusively
with
transactions
with
third
parties;
whereas
here,
58
%
relate
to
employment
relationships--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--no.
i
wanted
to
continue,
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
second,
in
kern-limerick
the
government
plastered
the
contracts
and
plastered
the
purchase
orders
with
clear
statements:
we
will
be
bound,
they
are
merely
our
agents,
we
will
pay.
it
was
done
deliberately
to
conserve
federal
funds.
no
such
language
is
found
here
until
july
1,
1977,
when
very
timid
contractual
modifications
are
inserted
only
in
the
contracts,
leaving
the
purchase
orders
exactly
the
way
they
were,
leaving
all
the
relationships
exactly
the
way
they
were.
third,
kern-limerick
inserted
all
this
contractual
language
long
in
advance
of
the
taxman
coming
calling.
here,
the
contracts
are
modified
two
years
into
a
tax
case.
i
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
putting
in
the...
it
indicates
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
kern-limerick
case.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
intended
that
the
mere
insertion
of
certain
magic
words
at
the
time
the
taxman
came
knocking
was
the
intent
of
protecting
the
government
against
affronts
to
its
supremacy.
we
are
long
past
the
days
of
mcculloch
v.
maryland
when
there
was
danger
that
discriminatory
taxation
by
the
states
would
consume
the
newly-hatched
federal
government.
if
anything,
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot
today.
but
having
given
the
power
to
federal
contracting
officers
to
insert
agency-creating
clauses,
whatever
the
wisdom
of
that
balance
may
be,
it
seems
to
me
that
great
scrutiny
should
be
given
when
the
affront
to
the
supremacy
of
the
united
states
that
is
claimed
is
self-created,
and
when,
in
fact,
these
contractors
are
indistinguishable
from
other
cost
plus
contractors.
the
only
difference
here
is
the
advanced
funding.
our
brief
indicates
clearly
that
advanced
funding
was
viewed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
only
as
a
reimbursement
method
for
cost
plus
contractors.
you
paid
them
in
advance,
but
later
on
you
had
an
audit
and
you
netted
out
what
you
would
have
advanced
against
what
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
reimbursement.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
it
did,
justice
powell.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
well,
it's
similar.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
that
is
correct,
justice
powell,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
that
at
the
time
that
congress
reversed...
if
you
will
pardon
that
expression--
mr.
daniel
h.
friedman
--that's
right.
but
they
left
intact
section
4(c)
which
this
court
had
referred
to
in
roane-anderson.
obviously,
in
repealing
the
roane-anderson
decision,
i
don't
believe
that
congress
intended
that
chance
contractual
clauses
could
be
grouped
together
to
equal
an
agency
relationship.
that
is
simply
the
way
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
always
done
business.
thank
you
very
much.
