unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
jones,
you
said
this
is
a
standard
form
of
contract
developed
by
the
predecessor
of
ferc?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
everything
that
it
uses
is
supplied
by
the
government,
isn't
it?
all
the
funds
it
spends
and
everything
else
is
supplied
by
the
government.
unknown
speaker
do
they
make
a
profit
under
these
contracts?
unknown
speaker
is
that
substantial?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
the
government
does
this
sort
of
thing
just
to
get
the
management
know-how
of
these
companies?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
rather
than
do
the
job
itself.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
jones,
are
you
going
to
elaborate
on
your
footnote
on
page
27
of
your
brief
of
the
carson-roane
and
then
repeal
of
9(b)
and
then
kern-limerick?
because
certainly,
congress
itself
was
not
entirely
happy
with
the
carson-roane
decision,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
government
concedes
that
these
contractors
are
on
the
same
footing
as
any
other
sort
of
government
contractors;
they
don't
occupy
any
special
status
by
virtue
of
the
earlier
legislation
that
was
passed
in
the
forties.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
it
is
immune
from
the
state
tax
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
payments
by
these
contractors
for
the
services
of
its
employees?
unknown
speaker
as
well
as
the
goods
that
are
purchased.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
conceive
that
the
employees
work
for
the
contractor
and
not
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is...
it
certainly
is
true,
though,
that
making
the
employees
technically
employees
of
sandia
rather
than
the
government
distinguishes
them
in
very
substantial
ways
from
other
employees
of
the
government.
they
aren't
civil
service
people,
they
aren't
subject
to
the
normal
rules
about
government
employees,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
record
or
is
it
agreed
what
the
real
motivation
was
for
moving
into
the
sandia
type
operations?
did
you
say
they
just
thought
it
was
the
best
way
of
drawing
on
the
private
sector?
unknown
speaker
and
most
efficient?
unknown
speaker
and
they
would
hire...
they
would
have
to
pay
what
the
market
required
them
to
pay
for
that
kind
of
skill.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
mr.
jones,
these
employees,
do
they
not,
have
the
protections,
for
example,
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
davis-bacon
acts
and
all
the
rest
of
them,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
things
that
are
applicable
to
other
private
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
they
weren't
grade
18.
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
so-called
government-owned/contractor
operated
system
that
was
in
effect
during
the
war
in
all
the
munitions
plants
in
the
country?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
in
that
regard,
i
take
it
you
agree
with
new
mexico
that
there
are
over
10,000
other
contracts
around
the
country
using
advanced
funding
arrangements
like
this
in
which
the
contractors
are
not
apparently
purchasing
agents
of
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
show
us
how
many
comparable
advanced
funding
arrangements
there
are
in
existence
that
the
government
has?
comparable
to
these?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
unique,
you
don't
mean
because
they're
atomic
energy
contractors,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
relationship.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
of
their
own.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
these
people
aren't
doing
this
out
of
pure
altruism,
as
indicated
by
the
fact
of...
is
it
sandia
that
gets
licenses
on
any
of
the
developments
in
the
laboratory
work?
unknown
speaker
are
those
entirely
consistent
with
county
of
fresno?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
on
this
advanced
spending
point.
would
the
government's
position
be
the
same
if
there
were
no
advanced
funding
but
there
was
merely
a
cost
plus
arrangement,
with
the
government
reimbursing
the
contractor?
unknown
speaker
why
would
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
change.
everything
else
is
the
same
except
instead
of
paying
in
advance,
you
purchase
on
credit
and
then
as
soon
as
the
contractor
pays
the
ball,
the
government
reimburses
the
contractor,
but
the
legal
liabilities
are
all
exactly
the
same
as
here
would
it
be
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
use
tax
in
boyd
is
different
from
the
use
tax
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
gross
receipts
tax
here
also.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
economic
effect
the
same
for
both
types
of
use
taxes
as
you
describe
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
uses
it
in
new
mexico?
who
uses
the
property
in
new
mexico?
doesn't
the
contractor
use
it?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
end
in
both
situations,
the
united
states
government
pays
the
tax.
unknown
speaker
does
all
of
this
depend
on
precisely
the
way
that
the
state
legislature
writes
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
plus
in
the
sandia
case.
unknown
speaker
those
license
might
produce
very
valuable
results
for
sandia,
might
they
not?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
risk
of
loss
of
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
if
it's
the
contractor's
fault.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
may
be
true
about
sandia,
but
what
about
an
ordinary
cost
plus
contractor?
if
he
negligently...
if
the
property
is
negligently
destroyed
by
him,
it's
not
going
to
go
into
his
cost.
unknown
speaker
but
here,
i
don't
know.
what
about
sandia?
unknown
speaker
but
the
risk
of
loss
of
the
property
is
on
the
government
for
almost
all
purposes
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
suppose
we
were
to
determine
that
the
lower
court
was
correct,
and
that
the
government
is
not
immune
from
these
taxes.
and
let's
further
suppose
that
the
contractor,
sandia
or
the
others,
simply
refused
to
pay
them.
do
you
think
new
mexico
could
seize
the
property
in
that
event?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
then
is
on
the
government?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
you
don't
think
that
an
employee
or
a
vendor
of
goods
to
the
contractor
could
ever
sue
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
contractor
somehow
absconds
with
the
funds
that
have
been
advanced,
whoever
should
have
been
paid
with
them
is
out
of
luck.
unknown
speaker
he
couldn't
get
the
money,
but
how
about
suing
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean?
that
he
could
or
could
not
sue
in
the
court
of
claims?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
united
states
is
an
obligor,
why
couldn't
he
sue
them?
i
would
think
he
could.
but
i
thought
your
message
to
us
was
that
the
only
obligation
that's
owed
to
any
third
parties
is
the
contractor's
obligation.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
right,
there
is
no
direct
obligation
or
indirect
of
the
united
states
to
third
parties,
including
employees
and
vendors.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
just
assume
the
answer...
that
whether
you
can
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
depends
on
whether
or
not
there
is
some
kind
of
a
contractual
obligation
with
the
united
states
between
the
third
party
and
the
united
states.
is
there
or
not?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
we
can
find
out
what
the
united
states'
position
is
on
that
shortly.
unknown
speaker
you
say
whatever
authority
the
contractor
has
in
this
case,
it
is
your
position
i
take
it,
that
it
has
no
authority
to
obligate
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if...
well,
never
mind.
unknown
speaker
help
me
again.
i
thought
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
relationship
insofar
as
purchasing
was
concerned
made
these
three
companies
purchasing
agents
of
the
united
states,
which
would
seem
to
me
to
mean
they
had
the
authority
to
obligate
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
saying
even
if
that's
true
we
would
reverse.
unknown
speaker
if
one
of
these
contractors
buys
from
a
third
party
and
he
is
required
to
order
in
his
own
name,
that's
perfectly
true.
but
upon
delivery,
the
united
states
owns
the
property.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
there
have
probably
been
weaker
claims
of
contract
with
the
united
states
that
have
prevailed
in
the
court
of
claims
than
this
one.
unknown
speaker
your
submission
i
suppose
is
if
the
united
states
wants
a
tax
immunity,
it
ought
to
either
have
what
might
be
called
an
instrumentality
or
they
just
ought
to
do
it
with
their
own
employees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
what
about
the
first
question
in
the
boyd
case
that
was
not
appealed?
isn't
it
correct
that
the
tennessee
court
held
that
the
contractor
was
a
purchasing
agent
and
therefore
was
immune
from
the
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
still
good
law,
why
doesn't
that
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
the
legal
issue
here
is...
the
bottom
line
is
whether
the
united
states
had
a
direct
obligation
to
the
vendor?
that's
really
what
we
have
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
with
regard
to
the
employees.
they
don't
have
responsibility
for
labor
negotiations
and
all
that.
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
maybe
i'm
confused
on
the
facts
a
little
bit
on
this
48
%
and
52
%.
the
tax
that
is
sought
to
be
imposed
here
is
on
the
receipts
by
the
vendor
in
making--
unknown
speaker
--receipts
by
the
contractors
paid
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
and
is
the
state
of
new
mexico
seeking
to
impose
a
tax
on
what
the
united
states
pays
the
contractor
for
its
labor
costs?
unknown
speaker
is
it
true
that
nearly
60
%
of
that
total
is
payment
to
employees
for
salaries?
unknown
speaker
there
are
7400
employees?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
on
the
receipts
by
the
contractor
with
respect
to
employees.
but
what
purchases?
is
it
also
measured
by
his
advanced
funding
from
the
government
for
purchases?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
how
much...
or
is
the
tax
collected
by
the
vendors?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
but
just
mechanically,
is
it
the
vendor
who
pays
the
tax
and
then
adds
it
to
the
bill?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
vendor
of
goods
to
the
contractor
doesn't
pay
a
gross
receipts
tax.
unknown
speaker
but
not
on
those
sales.
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
two
gross
receipts
on--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
you
tax
the
contractor,
the
contractor's
vendors
are
not
going
to
have
to
pay
that.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
sandia
occupies
quite
a
bit
of
property
around
albuquerque,
and
all
of
that
property
is
tax
exempt.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
do
you
think
that
for
you
to
prevail,
kern-limerick
has
to
be
overruled?
unknown
speaker
anymore
than
boyd
had
to
overrule
it,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
this
case
like
kern-limerick
to
the
extent
it
has
third
party
dealings--
unknown
speaker
--please
do.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
contract
in
carson
also
involve
advanced
funding?
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
say
that's
the
only
difference
here?
unknown
speaker
the
contract
is
almost
identical,
isn't
it?
the
contract
involved
in
carson
is
almost
identical
to
the
contract
here.
unknown
speaker
congress
repealed
section
9(b),
following
carson.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
that's
sort
of
an
arbitration
of
a
dispute.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
mean
he
wins;
that
just
tells
him
where
to
go
to
get--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
don't
know
if
that
follows.
the
contract
might
say
that
he
has
to
go
to
the
american
arbitration
association,
but
it
doesn't
mean
the
american
arbitration
association
will
be
liable
on
the
contract.
but
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question.
supposing
there
was
a
contract,
an
order
to
purchase
something
for
delivery
in
six
months,
and
there
was
a...
then
a
cancellation
of
the
order,
which
would
be
in
normal
commercial
terms,
a
breach
of
the
contract.
would
you
say
that
the
vendor
could
then
sue
the
united
states
directly?
unknown
speaker
say
the
contractor
went
insolvent
or
something
like
that.
you
say
there's
definitely
a
direct
obligation...
and
that's
the
key
to
your
case,
is
it?
the
united
states
is
obligated
on
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
that's
even
before
they're
paid,
so
you
really
don't
have
to
rely
on
advanced
funding,
if
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question
if
i
may.
with
regard
to
the
50
or
60
%
of
the
receipts
by
the
contractor
that
are
used
to
reimburse
his
own
employees,
not
to
pay
vendors,
does
the
government
contend
that
those
receipts
are
also
immune
from
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
and
the
whole
purchasing
relationship
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
part
of...
say
you
had
a
contractor
that
didn't
ever
buy
anything;
had
all
the
same
contractual
setup,
but
all
they
did
was
do
a
lot
of
research
and
services
of
one
kind
or
another.
you'd
say
they're
still
immune?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
third
parties
here
are
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
the
employees
are
not
united
states
employees.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
employees
were
not
paid
by
the
contractor,
the
employees
then
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
against
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
your
answer
yes?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
wrong
on
the...
you
think
the
case
does
turn
on
whether
the
united
states
is
obligated
directly
to
the
third
parties
and
to
the
employees?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
were
wrong
on
that?
would
you
lose
the
case?
unknown
speaker
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
