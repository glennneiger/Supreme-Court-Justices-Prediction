mr.
george
w.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether,
under
standard
atomic
commission
management
contracts,
three
private
contractors
received
and
disbursed
funds
of
the
united
states
as
agents
of
the
federal
government
and
are,
therefore,
constitutionally
immune
from
new
mexico's
gross
receipts
and
compensating
use
taxes.
each
of
the
contractors
is
a
party
to
a
management
contract
with
the
department
of
energy,
a
form
of
contract
developed
by
its
predecessor,
the
atomic
energy
commission.
the
united
states
filed
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
mexico,
seeking
declaratory
judgment
that
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
to
the
department
of
energy
through
the
management
contractors
was
a
sale
to
the
united
states
and
therefore
exempt
from
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
and
compensating
taxes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
the
management
contract
concept,
i
suppose
it
could
be
called,
was
developed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
shortly
after
the
world
war
ii,
and--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
sandia,
one
of
the
contractors,
makes
no
profit,
receives
no
fee
and
does
no
other
work,
other
than
the
work
it
does
for
the
government.
zia
and
laci,
the
two
other
contractors
in
this
case,
receive
a
management
fee.
in
addition,--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
guess
it's
relative.
if
you
compare
it
to
the
amount
of
money
they
spend,
it's
not
substantial,
it's
a
small
percentage.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
fee
that
zia
received,
but
it's
not...
in
the
mid-seventies
i
think
it
was
not
more
than
$50,000.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
the
primary
reason.
it
really
started--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
it
would
be
very
difficult,
i
imagine,
for
the
government
to
do
the
job
because
they'd
have
to
hire
all
of
these
people
who
have
expertise
in
particular
areas
who
might
well
be
working
for
private
companies
in
different
areas
using
that
expertise.
and
very
early
on...
i
think
this
is
primarily
historical.
the
manhattan
engineer
district,
which
is
responsible
for
the
development
of
the
atomic
bomb
in
world
war
ii,
decided
that
the
quickest
and
most
efficient
way
of
getting
the
manpower
and
the
knowledge
and
the
know-how
for
the
development
of
the
atomic
bomb
was
to
draw
on
the
resources
of
private
industry.
and
congress
after
world
war
ii
when
it
created
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
gave
it
statutory
authority
to
control
the
development
of
atomic
energy,
it
specifically
indicated
that
the
commission
should
be
permitted
to,
or
the
commission
could
continue
this
policy
of
drawing
on
or
relying
on
private
contractors
for
the
carrying
out
of
its
functions.
and
although
the
atomic
energy
commission
replaced
the
manhattan
engineers
district
in
1947
and
then
was
in
turn
replaced
by
the
energy
research
and
development
administration
in,
i
guess,
1975,
and
then
erda,
the
energy
research
and
development
administration,
was
replaced
by
the
department
of
energy
in
1977,
they
have
all
continued
to
use
these
same
kinds
of
management
contracts
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
their
responsibilities.
the
united
states
filed
this
action
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
sales
to
the
management
contractors
were
sales
to
its
agents,
and
therefore,
to
the
united
states.
and
as
a
result,
immune
or
exempt
from
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax.
the
united
states
also
sought
declaratory
judgment
that
the
funds
disbursed
by
these
three
contractors
were
not
subject
to
either
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax
or
the
compensating
tax.
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
held
that
the
management
contractors
were,
in
fact,
agents,
and
that
the
sales
of
personal
property
to
them
were
exempt
from
both
the
gross
receipts
and
compensating
taxes,
and
that
the
disbursements
by
the
contractors
were
also
exempt
from
such
taxes.
the
tenth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
management
contractors
were
not
agents
and
consequently
subject
to
such
taxes.
the
court
of
appeals
explained
its
decision
by
saying
our
reiterated
antipathy
to
wholesale
deprivations
of
state
treasuries
without
congressional
action
requires
at
the
least
some
special
arrangement
before
tax
immunity
attaches.
the
relevance
of
the
court
of
appeals'
hostility
to
federal
immunity
or
deprivations
of
state
treasuries
would
be
dubious
in
almost
any
case.
and
i
will
attempt
to
show,
that
the
court's
stated
antipathy
is
misdirected
is
misdirected
in
this
case.
mr.
george
w.
jones
but,
justice
rehnquist,
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
saying
that
the...
everyone
or
all
of
the
contractors
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
are
completely
immune
from
state
taxation
and
saying
that
the
contractor
shall
be
immune
to
the
extent
that
all
other
contracts
with
the
federal
government
would
be
immune.
and
congress
clearly
recognized
the
distinction
because
they
made
it
clear
that
all
they
were
doing
was
repealing
the
decision
that
this
court
had
interpreted
as
creating
a
statutory
immunity.
and
i'm
not
sure
what
further
elaboration
on
that
point
you
were
seeking.
mr.
george
w.
jones
we
concede
only
that
there's
no
statutory
immunity,
such
as
section
9(b),
but
it
is
not
our
position
that
these
contractors
are
like
any
other
contractors.
i
mean,
their
immunity
from
taxation
is
determined
in
the
same
way
that
any
other
private
contractor's
immunity
would
be
determined,
but
the
nature
of
their
relationship
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
we
think
is
very
different
from
that
of
many
other
private
contractors.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
disbursements--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
distinction,
no
reasonable
distinction,
to
be
drawn
between
the
disbursements
by
these
contractors
of
funds
for
the
payment
of
services
and
their
disbursement
of
funds
for
the
payment
of
goods,
because
in
both
cases,
the
contractors
are
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
they
have
no
interest
in
the
money
they
use
to
purchase
these
things.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
they
work
for
the
contractor
in
a
very
peculiar
sense.
sandia
is
totally
a
creation
or
a
product
of
this
arrangement
with
the
government.
it
had
no
existence
until
1949.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
receives
no
fee
from
the
government,
it
does
no
other
work.
furthermore,
in
the
contract
between
the
united
states
and
sandia,
and
sandia's
parent
company,
western
electric
company,
it
indicates
that
if
the
contract
is
terminated,
western
electric,
which
owns
all
of
the
stock
of
sandia,
would
be
required
to
dispose
of
that
stock
as
directed
by
the
department
of
energy,
and
before
doing
that,
required
to
designate
a
new
board
of
directors,
as
indicated
by
the
department
of
energy.
the
employees
at
sandia
were
hired
solely
to
perform
functions
for
the
government
in
exactly
the
same
sense
as
sandia's
purchase
of
supplies
from
a
third
party
vendor
are
made
solely
for...
on
behalf
of
the
government.
sandia
is
the
largest
of
the
three
contractors
and
it
was
created
in
1949
as
a
special
subsidiary
of
western
electric.
from
1949
until
the
present
time,
sandia
has
carried
on
its
responsibilities
for
the
government,
notwithstanding
the
changes
in
the
various
government
agencies
that
had
responsibility
for
the
development
of
atomic
energy.
mr.
george
w.
jones
sure.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
their
distinction
from
ordinary
government
employees
for
those
purposes--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--yes.
the--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--the
article
that
is
cited
most
that
discusses
the
sort
of
general
development
of
these
things
is
an
article
by...
i
think
the
guy
who
is
a
former
general
counsel
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
and
he
discusses
in
some
detail
the
development
of
these
things.
and
it
appears
that
the...
it's
by
highstein
and
florshim,
called
the
aec
management
contract
concept.
but
it
appears
that
the
manhattan
engineer
district
needed
to
mobilize
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
and
resources
and
energy
in
a
very
short
time
and
do
it
secretly,
and
they
decided
that
the
best
way
to
do
it
was
to
hire
private
contractors
to
mobilize
or
draw
on
the
resources
of
private
contractors.
mr.
george
w.
jones
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
occurred
because
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
george
w.
jones
sure,
they
do.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
but
we
are
not
sure
what
their
salaries
are,
and
those
are
very
carefully
controlled
in
some
circumstances
by
the
atomic
energy
commission,
the
department
of
energy
now.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no,
i'm
not.
the
other
contractor,
laci,
which
is
los
alamos
constructors,
inc,
was
also...
is
a
subsidiary
of
zia
and
was
also
formed
specifically
to
do
work
for
the
government.
it
performs...
its
only
work
is
construction
and
repair
and
alterations
at
the
los
alamos
scientific
laboratory.
under
these
contracts,
neither
sandia,
zia
nor
laci
is
required
to
spend
any
money
in
performance
of
the
contracts
with
the
department
of
energy.
mr.
george
w.
jones
i
don't
think
that's
mexico's
position.
i
think
they
say
that
there
are
10,000
other
letter
of
credit
arrangements.
most
of
those,
as
we
point
out,
most
of
those
letter
of
credit
arrangements
are
grants
to
private
individuals
and
not
contractors.
so
in
our
view,
the
fact
that
there
are
these
letters
of
credit
available
and
used
by
other
agencies
in
other
contexts
for
other
purposes
has
no
bearing
at
all
on
whether
the
use
of
letters
of
credit
by
contractors
to
purchase
property,
title
to
which
passes
directly
to
the
united
states--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
i
am
not
sure
the
record
indicates
anything
specific
about
the
nature
of
the
other
contracts.
if
you
look
at
the
attachments
to
the
deposition
of
mr.
mcgrath,
you
will
see
that
they
are...
that
the
letters
of
credit
are
to
institutions
that
are
not
doing
work
for
the
government.
there
are
about
40
or
so
attached,
and
they
are
all
to...
most
of
them
are
to
grantees.
there
is
one
from
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare...
it's
not
that
anymore,
it's
health
and
human
services
now...
to
a
professional
review
board.
but
it's
not
clear
what
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
that
organization
and
has
is.
so
it's
not
even
clear
that
the
one
example
they
point
to
is
comparable
to
the
contracts
here.
our
impression,
however,
is
that
the
type
of
relationship
that
exists
between
the
management
contractors
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
here
is
virtually
unique.
there
may
be
other
contracts
in
which
various
aspects
of
the
relationship
are
duplicated.
but
as
far
as
we
know,
there's
no
substantial
number
of
government
contracts
in
which
you
have
the
unique
combination
of
elements
of
a
contract
that
exist
between
the
management
contractors
and
department
of
energy.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right,
the
relationship
created
by
the
contract
is
relatively
unique.
none
of
these
contractors
spend
any
money
under
the
contract.
mr.
george
w.
jones
of
their
own.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
they
give
as
much
as
they
get,
however.
we
don't
suggest
that
they're
doing
it
because
of
altruism.
as
the
state
points
out
in
some
detail,
there
are
benefits
to
the
private
contractors.
i
mean,
the
knowledge
and
experience
that's
developed
in
these
areas.
the
dissenting
opinion
in
livingston
points
out
in
great
detail
that
these
contractors
receive
a
large
number
of
benefits
from
the
government
or
in
the
course
of
their
work.
that
does
not
change
the
nature
of
their
relationship
to
the
government,
however.
employees
of
the
government
learn
a
lot
in
the
course
of
their
work
for
the
government.
a
lot
of
young
lawyers
work
at
the
justice
department
for
some
time
and
then
go
on
to
private
practice,
using
what
they've
learned.
so
we
don't
think
that
changes
the
relationship
between
the
two.
the
new
mexico
gross
receipts
tax
involved
in
this
case
is
essentially
a
sales
tax.
it's
assessed
on
the
total
amount
of
money
that
is
realized
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
from
performing
services,
including
professional
and
construction
services.
in
addition,
new
mexico
has
what's
called
a
compensating
tax
imposed
on
the
use
of
property
that
is
imported
into
the
state
without
the
payment
of
a
gross
receipts
tax.
although
use
is
one
of
the
aspects
of...
one
of
the
factors
that
triggers
application
of
the
tax,
it
is
not
a
use
tax
of
the
sort
considered
by
this
court
in
boyd,
which
was
a
tax
on
the
use
per
se
of
the
property.
the
use
tax
involved
in
this
case
is
essentially
a
complement
to
the
gross
receipts
tax
to
protect
new
mexico
businessmen
from
the
unfair
competition
that
would
result
from
businessmen,
their
competitors,
being
able
to
buy
property
outside
the
state
and
bring
it
into
the
state
without
paying
a
gross
receipts
tax.
since
1819,
it
has
been
unquestionably
clear
that
the
federal
government
and
its
instrumentalities
are
constitutionally
immune
from
any
form
of
state
taxation,
absent
congressional
consent.
in
our
system,
the
tax
immunity
of
the
federal
government
is
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
supremacy
declared
by
the
constitution.
kern-limerick
establishes
the
principle
that
the
federal
government's
immunity
from
taxation
is
preserved
even
though
the
federal
government
chooses
to
exercise
or
to
perform
its
work
through
private
contractors
or
private
agents.
kern-limerick
rests
very
soundly
on
the
truism
that
the
government
can
only
function
through
employees
or
agents.
and
if
the
individuals
or
entities
through
whom
the
government
works
can
be
taxed
with
respect
to
their
activities
on
behalf
of
the
government,
federal
immunity
would
be
largely
illusory.
accepting
this
analysis,
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
found
that
the
management
contractors
in
this
case
are
not
agents
for
the
purposes
of
procuring
goods
and
services
for
the
united
states.
that
conclusion
is
contrary
to
every
other
court
that
has
considered
the
question;
this
court's
summary
affirmative
decision
in
livingston,
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
nevada
tax
commission,
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
boyd,
which
was
not--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--yes.
county
of
fresno
involved
the
question
of
the
state's
power
to
tax
an
employee
of
the
government's
interest,
beneficial
interest
or
beneficial
use
of
government-owned
property.
here,
new
mexico
hasn't
purported
to
tax
the
contractor's
interest
in
or
use
of
the
government's
property.
they
have
tried
to
impose
a
tax
or
interpreted
their
gross
receipts
tax
to
apply
to
money
that
the
contractors
have
no
interest
in
and
no
use
of.
they
are
simply
acting
as
agents
for,
disbursing
agents,
for
the
government.
the
money
goes
into
the
special
account,
or
the
special
account
is
set
up
in
the
name
of
the
contractor
and
the
atomic
energy
commission.
the
contractor
acquires
no
interest
in
the
funds
in
that
account;
title
always
remains
in
the
government,
and
the
contractor
writes
a
draft,
executes
a
draft
on
the
account--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--no.
mr.
george
w.
jones
because
in
the
latter
case...
well,
our
position
might
be
the
same
depending
on
what
other
aspects
of
the
arrangement--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
think
it
probably
would
be
a
different
case,
but
as
this
court's
decision
in
kern-limerick
makes
clear,
the
fact
that
the
government
could
have
accomplished
its
goals
in
different
ways
by
adopting
a
different
contract
than
the
one
it
did,
does
not
indicate
or
nullify
the
effectiveness
of
the
contract
that
it
did
adopt.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
relationship
here
including
the
advanced
funding
for
the
purchase
of
goods
for
the
united
states
and
services
for
the
united
states
indicates
an
agency
relationship,
at
least
as
clearly
as
the
relationship
indicated
in
kern-limerick.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
in
boyd
there
were
three
taxes
involved.
there
was
a
gross
receipts
tax
and
a
compensating
tax
of
the
sort
involved
here,--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
a
gross
receipts
tax
and
a
compensating
tax
that
were
of
the
sort,
exactly
the
same
sort
that
are
involved
here.
those
were
not
reviewed
by
this
court.
the
only
tax
that
was
considered
by
this
court
was
what
the
tennessee
supreme
court
described
as
a
use
per
se
tax.
it
was
a
tax
on
the
use
of
government
property,
wholly
without
regard
to
who
purchased
it
or
where
it
was
purchased.
and
this
court--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
think
not,
because
the
use
tax
in
new
mexico
is
not
a
use
tax;
it's
properly
called
a
compensating
tax,--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--certainly,
but
the
tax
is
not
on
his
use.
the
tax
is
simply
to
collect
the
gross
receipts
tax
that
was
avoided
by
purchasing
the
property
outside
the
state.
mr.
george
w.
jones
oh,
that's
for
sure.
but
the
holding
in
boyd
is
simply
that
the
contractor's
beneficial
use
of
the
property
of
the
government
was
a
taxable
interest.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
i
don't
know,
precisely
the
way
the
state
legislature
writes
a
tax.
but
it
does
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
interest
that
the
state
purports
to
tax.
for
example,
this
court
last
term
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
a
case,
united
states
v.
state
of
colorado
precisely
because
the
state
of
colorado
purported
to
tax
the
use
by
a
management
contractor
of
a
facility,
a
government-owned
facility,
on
its
full
value
to
the
contractor.
and
the
tenth
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
there
was
no
meaningful
use
that
the
state
could
tax
to
the
contractor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
w.
jones
i
have
two
points.
first,
in
both
sandia
and...
sandia's
purchase
order,
the
standard
terms
and
provisions
of
sandia's
purchase
order,
and
the
purchase
order
or
standard
terms
of
zia's
purchase
order
they
indicate
that
any
claims
against
the
contractor
arising
out
of
this
subcontract,
in
effect,
this
purchase
order,
that
are
not
resolved
by
the
contractor
and
the
supplier
must
be
submitted
to
a
government
contracting
officer.
the
erda
official
or
the
department
of
energy
official
who
supervises
the
contract,
and
if--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--and
if
the
dispute
is
not
resolved
at
that
point,
the
supplier
must
seek
redress
before
the
department
of
energy
contract
board
of
appeals.
mr.
george
w.
jones
but
that
very
clearly
indicates
that
he
has
a
claim
against
the
united
states.
and
if
he's
not
satisfied
with
the
conclusion
of
the
contract
board
of
appeals,
his
recourse
is
to
seek
judicial
review.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
sue
both
the
contractor,
and
the
united
states.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
it
follows
from
our
position
that
these
guys
are
agents
of
the
united
states.
it
necessarily
follows.
the
consequence
of
having
an
agent
act
for
you
is
that
you
are
bound
by
their
actions--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right,
because
the
contractors
have
no
interest
in
the
money.
they
purchase
these
services
of
these
third
parties--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right,
but
they
hire
these
employees
for
the
united
states,
to
provide
services
to
the
united
states.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
i
suppose
they
would
have
a
contract
claim
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
and
one
final
point.
the
contract
modifications
in
this
case
that
the
state
makes
so
much
of
in
1977
simply
confirmed
what
nobody
denied
until
1967.
even
the
state
of
new
mexico
recognized
that
these
contractors
or
contractors
of
this
sort
were
agents
of
the
united
states,
even
though...
on
all
of
their
receipts
from
the
united
states
except
their
fees.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
it
turns
on
that.
it
seems,
as
i
said,
that--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--no.
well,
i
mean
i
can't
be
wrong
on
that
if
these
guys
are
agents.
if
the
contractors
are
agents
for
the
united
states,
then
the
united
states
is
bound
by
their
contractual
undertakings
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
w.
jones
within
the
scope
of
their
authority,
as
all
agents.
