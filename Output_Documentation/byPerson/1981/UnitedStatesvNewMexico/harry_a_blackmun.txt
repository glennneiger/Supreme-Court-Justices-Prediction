justice
harry
a.
blackmun
united
states
against
new
mexico
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
issue
is
the
extent
to
which
a
state
may
impose
taxes
on
contractors
that
conduct
business
with
the
federal
government.
new
mexico
imposes
a
gross
receipts
tax
and
a
compensating
use
tax
on
those
who
do
business
within
that
state.
the
sandia
corporation
and
the
zia
company
have
contracts
with
the
government
to
manage
certain
government-owned
atomic
laboratories
in
new
mexico.
and
los
alamos
constructors
has
a
contract
for
construction
and
repair
work
at
one
of
the
laboratories.
the
contracts
use
an
“advanced
funding”
procedure
to
meet
costs
and
by
this
procedure,
the
contractor
is
allowed
to
pay
creditors
and
employees
also
with
drafts
drawn
on
a
special
bank
account
in
which
federal
funds
are
deposited.
the
united
states
brought
suit
in
federal
courts
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
new
mexico
taxes
do
not
apply
to
these
contractors.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
government.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
took
the
view
that
the
relationships
between
the
government
and
the
contractors
did
not
so
incorporate
the
latter
into
the
government
structure
as
to
make
them
"instrumentalities
of
the
united
states"
immune
from
the
new
mexico
taxes.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
contractors
are
not
protected
by
the
constitutions
guarantee
of
federal
supremacy
despite
the
fact
that
the
tax
had
an
effect
on
the
federal
government
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
united
states
shoulders
the
economic
burden
of
the
levy.
immunity
is
appropriate
only
where
the
state
levy
falls
on
the
united
states
itself
or
on
an
agency
or
instrumentality
so
closely
connected
to
the
government
that
the
two
cannot
realistically
be
viewed
as
separate
entities.
that
decision
is
unanimous.
