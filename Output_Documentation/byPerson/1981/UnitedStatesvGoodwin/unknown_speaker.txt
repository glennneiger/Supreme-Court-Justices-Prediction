unknown
speaker
move
the
microphone
closer
to
you.
i
can't
hear.
unknown
speaker
those
little
tiny
microphones,
you
can
pull
them
just
closer
to
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
can't
hear
you,
though,
we'll
have
to
have
the
reality
take
over.
try
moving
them
about
two
inches
nearer
to
you,
gently.
unknown
speaker
be
careful.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
there
lots
of
antitrust
cases
out
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
would
you
concede
that
in
a
case
when
there
is
actual
vindictiveness
involved
that
the
court
should
make
inquiry
into
that
and
then--
unknown
speaker
--base
its
ruling
on--
unknown
speaker
--well,
xx
the
proper
showing
were
made,
then
you
would
concede
that
the
court
under
those
circumstances
could
dismiss
the
xx--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
would
you
concede
it
for
purposes
of
a
pretrial
situation?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
urging
the
application
of
a
per
se
rule
either
way,
in
other
words?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
can
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second.
in
this
particular
case,
where
the
argument
is
made
that
the
increased
charges
were
in
response
to
the
jury
demand,
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
was
under
a
duty
to
explain
his
reasons
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is
he
didn't
even
have
to
file
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
take?
i
guess
one
of
the
questions
is,
when
if
ever
is
a
factual
inquiry
appropriate
or
necessary?
would
you
concede
it
could
ever...
is
there
anything
he
could
do
to
require
the
prosecutor--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
normally.
mr.
frey,
is
it
normal
for
a
prosecutor
to
increase
the
charge
when
a
man
asks
for
a
jury
trial?
is
that
the
normal
procedure?
unknown
speaker
no.
will
you
answer
my
question:
is
it
normal
for
a--
unknown
speaker
--for
a
prosecutor...
sir?
unknown
speaker
when
it
does,
is
it
warranted
to
look
into
it?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
you
just
ask
the
prosecutor,
well,
why
did
you
do
it?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
entitled
to
ask
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
judge
within
his
right
to
ask,
or
is
the
prosecutor--
unknown
speaker
--does
he
have
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
added
a
lot
to
mine.
mine
is
that
the
defendant
asks
and
at
the
defendant's
request
the
judge
says:
mr.
prosecutor,
why
did
you
raise
this
charge,
period.
that's
all
he
asks.
and
that
takes
how
much
time?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
interested
in
whether
the
prosecutor
has
objection.
i'm
interested
as
to
whether
the
judge
has
a
right
to
ask
him.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
judge
asks
him,
he's
exercising
a
discretionary
right.
there's
not
going
to
be
any
appeal
or
any
appellate
review
of
any
kind
of
whether
the
judge
should
or
shouldn't
have
asked
him.
if
he
asked
him,
the
prosecutor
is
probably
very
likely
to
respond,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
he
have
to
respond
to
a
judge's
request?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i
said,
in
an
ordinary
case,
you
remember,
the
man's
charge
is
raised
after
he
asks
for
a
jury
trial.
and
he
says:
judge,
this
man
has
raised
my
charge
after
i
asked
for
a
jury
trial.
i'd
like
to
know
why.
the
judge
says:
i
agree.
mr.
prosecutor,
why?
the
prosecutor
is
obliged
to
answer
in
my
opinion.
unknown
speaker
and
that
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
time.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
that
this
court
cast
aside
the
vindictiveness
point,
on
page
4a
of
the
appendix
to
your
petition
for
certiorari:
"on
this
record,
we
readily
conclude
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
act
with
actual
vindictiveness
in
seeking
the
felony
indictment.
"
unknown
speaker
but
they
said
that.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
go
beyond
what
they
said,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
before
we
leave
this
point,
if
the
judge
asks
the
prosecutor,
why
did
you
enhance
the
charges
after
a
jury
demand,
presumably
nine
out
of
ten
prosecutors
would
say,
well,
i
reexamined
the
case
and
i
concluded
this
was
the
appropriate
charge,
you
know,
the
appropriate
charge
for
these
facts.
then
it
seems
to
me
the
more
serious
question
is,
does
he
have
to
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
be
subject
to
examination
and
all
that.
would
there
ever
be
a
situation
in
your
view
where
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
subject
himself
to
cross-examination?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
are
there
facts
that
you
think
could
be
alleged
by
a
defendant
that
would
create
a
sufficient
appearance
of
vindictiveness
to
require
that
kind
of
procedure?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
as
i
understand
you
is
that
the
mere
sequence
of
events
which
we
have
in
this
case
is
not
enough
to
create
the
kind
of
presumption
that
requires
that
kind
of
response.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
particular
case
you
would
have
said
it
would
have
been
wrong
for
the
judge
to
require
either
the
affidavit
or
any
kind
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
i
think
that's
what
you--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand.
unknown
speaker
it's
your
position
that
this
alone
is
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
you
also
say
that
you
can
conceive
of
situations
where
it
would
require
the
judge--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frey,
would
the
facts
alleged
here
be
sufficient
in
your
view
to
allow
the
defendant
to
request
a
hearing
on
the
question?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
had
the
burden
of
going
forward
at
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
in
your
view,
these...
this
particular
situation
was
not
enough
to
even
enable
the
defendant
to
request
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
i'm
confused
a
little
bit
by
the
government's
position.
does
it
depart
at
all
from
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
because
in
your
brief
you
say
there's
no
logical
basis
for
extending
pearce
and
perry
beyond
their
setting
to
the
pretrial
stage
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
in
the
pretrial
stage
it
should
be
an
actual
factual
inquiry
and
a
certain
amount
of
evidence
to
be
adduced
by
the
defendant
before
any
inquiry
is
made?
unknown
speaker
are
you
stating
that
as
a
factual
matter,
mr.
spence,
that
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
reached
the
factual
conclusion
that
the
government
upped
the
ante
because
of
his
invocation
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean,
as
a
practical
matter?
does
that
simply
mean
that
that
the
raising
of
the
charges
came
after
the
request
for
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
would
have
been
tried
before
the
magistrate.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fourth
circuit
explicitly
ruled
out
vindictiveness,
malice,
in
its
opinion.
unknown
speaker
so
that
takes
the
legs
off
of
the
table
that
you
were
just
erecting,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spence,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
rule
here
that,
including
among
the
pretrial
activities
of
a
defendant
the
request
for
a
jury
trial,
that
would
trigger
this
presumption
that
you're
talking
about,
this
prophylactic
rule,
was
based
on
its
assessment
of
how
often
after
a
request
for
a
jury
trial
a
prosecutor
does
or
does
not
increase
the
charges?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
it's
based
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spence,
isn't
there
always
an
intervening
circumstance,
namely
that
the
lawyers
are
getting
ready
to
try
a
case
instead
of
just
file
some
pleadings?
doesn't
that
almost
always
generate
a
reassessment
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
which
often
leads
to
a
different
appraisal
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
what
about
his
failure
to
show
up.
unknown
speaker
mr.
spence,
there
have
been
comments
in
some
of
the
writings
along
here
that
your
position,
if
it
prevails,
will
force
prosecutors
to
throw
the
works
at
the
defendant
at
the
very
start
of
every
case.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
this
would
be
counterproductive
if
it
happened,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there
could
be
some
defendants
who
wouldn't
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
there
could
be
some
defendants
who
wouldn't
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
that
you
should
start
off
upping
up
the
charges.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
need
to
trigger
the
automatic
rule
that
you
want?
one,
that
the
charge
is
increased?
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was,
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
what
else
do
you
need?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
understand
the
government,
if
you
can
show
it
they
don't
mind
you
showing
it.
and
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
out
the
motivation
that
you're
driving
at,
did
they
not,
in
their
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
else
is
there
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
prosecutors
in
the
fourth
circuit,
or
some
of
them,
senior
prosecutors,
issued
a
memorandum
to
the
staff
lawyers,
the
assistant
united
states
attorneys
in
the
case
of
the
federal:
hereafter,
after...
once
you
have
arrived
at
the
proper
charge,
you
will
increase
it
by
the
next
higher
offense
to
enhance
our
bargaining
position
with
the
defendant.
is
that
prosecutorial
vindictiveness?
unknown
speaker
just
a
flat
rule.
every
time
that
they've
decided
they
have
a
manslaughter
case,
then
they're
going
to
push
it
up
to
some
kind
of
a
homicide,
other
homicide,
or
if
it's
a
second
degree,
if
there
are
degrees
in
the
jurisdiction,
push
it
up
to
first.
unknown
speaker
mr.
spence,
why
isn't
the
defendant
adequately
protected
by
a
rule
which
would
allow
for
dismissal
if
there
is
actual
vindictiveness,
but
not
otherwise?
why
isn't
that
entirely
adequate?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
make
that
kind
of
an
inquiry
in
selective
prosecution
claims?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
this
be
treated
in
the
same
fashion?
i
think
that's
how
this
case
should
be
treated,
your
honor.
as
to
selective
prosecution
cases,
i
am
frank
to
admit
that
i
am
not
positive
as
to
the
standard
which
this
court
would
require
in
analyzing
such
claims
or
in
analyzing
the
government's
rebuttal
of
such
claims.
we
would
only
state
there
is
a
difference
here,
and
that
is
a
difference
set
up
by
this
court,
that
the
presumption
of
prosecutorial
vindictiveness
will
arise
when
that
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
has
been
shown
at
the
outset
by
the
defendant,
when
he
has
met
his
initial
burden
to
show
that
the
circumstances
existent
in
the
case
generate
the
substantial
hazard
of
retaliation.
has
this
court
ever
decided
a
selective
prosecution
case?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
wick
woe
v.
hopkins?
unknown
speaker
that
was
some
time
ago.
sort
of
before
he
was
born.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
it
would
be
punitive
if
the
prosecutors
deliberately,
as
a
matter
of
regular
practice,
always
enhanced
the
charge
as
i
suggested
in
the
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
what
happens,
counsel,
if
in
the
federal
system
a
man
is
charged
with
selling
cocaine
and
the
day
before
the
trial
they
discover
that
the
person
that
he
sold
the
cocaine
to
was
a
child,
and
they
changed
the
indictment
to
a
request
for
the
death
penalty?
they
couldn't
do
it,
could
they,
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
situation
of
one
prosecutor
who
is
simply
either
inexperienced
or
incompetent
and
he
makes
a
bad
judgment.
the
staff
cannot
re-examine
that
judgment?
unknown
speaker
his
superiors
cannot
re-examine
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
rule
will
govern
the
prosecutor...
that
you
are
advancing
will
govern
a
prosecutorial
office
with
100
prosecutors
as
well
as
one
with
two
or
three.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
seriously
suggesting
that
with
100
prosecutors,
as
you
put
it,
the
right
hand
must
always
bound
to
know
what
the
left
hand
is
doing?
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
this
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
a
plea
bargaining
case.
unknown
speaker
i
believe
that
what
you
are
arguing
for
is
kind
of
a
mini-double-double
jeopardy,
isn't
it,
that
it
doesn't
start
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
but
when
the
indictment
is
first
returned,
that
the
prosecutor
would
be
best
advised
to
just
get
everything
out
on
the
table
right
then
because
if
he
doesn't,
there's
going
to
be
judicial
inquiry
into
why
he
didn't
from
then
on.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
really
sound,
because
we
have
held
double
jeopardy
starts
when
the
jury
is
empaneled.
it
doesn't
go
before
that.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
cure
for
this
is
for
all
prosecutors
to
make
a
preliminary
decision
and
then
up
it
one
or
two
points?
