mr.
paul
w.
spence
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
a
defendant
who
was
originally
charged
with
a
petty
offense,
a
misdemeanor
violation,
who
was
brought
before
a
united
states
magistrate
by
the
prosecution
for
trial
at
a
time
when
the
government
was
satisfied
to
proceed
on
said
petty
offense
and
misdemeanor
violations.
the
respondent's
only
action
at
that
time,
indeed
his
only
action
subsequent
to
that
time,
was
his
exercise
of
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
as
a
consequence,
this
individual
was
forced
to
face
felony
charges.
no
matter
how
the
actions
of
the
second
prosecutor
in
this
case
can
be
characterized,
no
matter
how
benignly
labeled
those
actions
can
be,
this
situation
smacks
of
the
sort
of
prosecutorial
reaction
to
the
exercise
of
a
procedural
right
that
was
proscribed
by
this
court
in
blackledge
v.
perry.
but
for
mr.
goodwin's
election
for
a
jury
trial,
he
would
have
disposed
of
his
case
in
the
misdemeanor,
petty
offense
context
before
the
united
states
magistrate
in
hyattsville.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it's
more
of
a
practical
conclusion.
assuming
the
court--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--as
a
factual
matter,
they
did
not
find
that
actual
vindictiveness
was
present
here,
in
other
words,
that
the
jury
trial
did
not
prompt
the
felony
charges.
as
a
practical
matter,
but
for
his
election
of
a
jury
trial,
the
fourth
circuit
did
hold
he
would
not
have
faced
those
felony
charges.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
well,
that's
certainly
part
of
it.
but
the
other
part,
the
more
important
part
of
it,
is
had
this
individual
not
elected
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
which
by
procedures
brought
his
case
to
baltimore
for
the
jury
trial,
he
would
have
remained
at
the
hyattsville
court
for
the
misdemeanor,
petty
offense
prosecution.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
that's
correct,
your
honor.
therefore,
but
for
his
election
the
procedures,
the
system
would
have
worked
to
keep
him
in
hyattsville,
and
the
extra
procedures
that
followed
would
not
have
occurred.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
well,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
this
case
certainly
is
not
and
has
never
been
one
involving
actual
vindictiveness.
petitioner
is
certainly
correct
in
stating
that.
it
has
been
conceded
from
the
outset
that
no
actual
vindictiveness
in
the
terms
of
a
subjective
malice
or
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
second
prosecutor
was
present.
however,
the
prophylactic
measure
established
by
this
court
in
blackledge
v.
perry
does
not
require
or
wait
for
a
showing
of
actual
vindictiveness
or
a
showing
of
actual
retaliatory
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
that's
made
very
clear
by
this
court
in
blackledge,
which
explicitly
states
that
they
did
not
find
actual
vindictiveness
in
the
case
before
it
and
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
such
a
finding.
rather
than
a
remedial
rule
which
is
designed
only
to
cure
the
effects
of
actual
vindictiveness,
the
blackledge
court
fashioned
a
preventive
measure
that
went
to
or
was
designed
to
purge
not
only
the
possibility
of
actual
retaliation,
actual
vindictiveness,
but
also
to
free
defendants
from
the
fear
of
such
retaliation.
this
court
recognized
in
that
case,
as
well
as
in
the
preceding
case
of
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
that
due
to
the
extraordinary
difficulty
of
proving
actual
motivations
and
subjective
intent
of
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor,
any
requirement
of
actual
vindictiveness
would
completely
undermine
the
due
process
protection
that
this
court
desired
to
erect.
therefore,
in
recognition
of
that,
the
blackledge
court
devised
this
prophylactic
measure
which
is
applicable
in
those
situations
where
the
hazard
of
vindictiveness
is
sufficient
enough
to
implicate
the
underlying
rationale
of
that
measure.
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
counsel's
assertions,
it
is
not
a
situation,
it
is
not
a
measure,
that
is
applicable
every
time
there
is
an
exercise
of
a
procedural
right
and
a
certain
upping
of
the
ante,
so
to
speak,
follows
it.
that
is
not
the
ruling
of
blackledge
v.
perry.
it
is
also
not
the
ruling
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
bottom
line
analysis
is
that
only
in
those
situations
that
generate
a
substantial,
a
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
will
they
then
apply
a
prophylactic
measure,
particularly
in
the
pretrial
setting.
obviously,
the
exercise
of
procedural
rights
by
the
defendant
is
indeed
commonplace.
obviously,
reactions
in
certain
ways
by
the
prosecutor
is
as
well
commonplace.
not
every
one
of
those
interplays
will
give
rise
to
the
application
of
the
prophylactic
measures
set
forth
in
blackledge.
however,
in
those
situations
where
the
circumstances
do
give
rise
to
the
requisite
substantial
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness,
then
the
prophylactic
measure
does
apply.
both
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
trial
court,
recognizing
the
similarity
between
this
case
and
the
facts
in
blackledge
v.
perry,
held
that
a
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
was
present,
that
the
hazard
inherent
in
the
facts
before
the
court
were
substantial
enough
to
warrant
the
application
of
the
prophylactic
rule.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
i
would
have
to
say
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
certainly
no
facts,
no
empirical
data,
was
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
well,
i
think
it's
based
on,
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
based
on
the
facts
before
it,
which
indicates
that
whatever
ongoing
investigation,
whatever
pretrial
preparation
which
the
government
asserts
in
justification
for
the
felony
charges,
was
indeed
completed
prior
to
the
may
24,
1979,
appearance
by
mr.
goodwin
before
the
magistrate.
thus
there
is
indeed
no
justification
or
no
changed
circumstances
or
new
evidence
subsequent
to
the
exercise
of
the
jury
trial
right
that
could
have
justified
the
felony
charges.
therefore,
rather
than
relying
on
empirical
data
which
would
lead
one
to
conclude
that
the
only
possible
basis
for
the
increased
charges
was
vindictive
motive,
it
looked
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
found
simply
that
the
jury
trial
right
preceded
the
increased
charges
and
that
nothing...
no
intervening
circumstance
or
changed
circumstance
came
after
the
jury
trial
right
and
the
increase
of
charges--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--well,
there's
no
question,
your
honor,
that
there
is
always
pretrial
preparation--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--our
position,
your
honor,
would
not
preclude
the
bringing
of
further
charges
if
that
reappraisal
or
ongoing
investigation
disclosed
new
facts
that
would
justify
new
charges.
that
is
not
the
case
before
the
court,
however.
the
case
before
the
court
is
a
situation
where
those
facts
that
are
offered
in
support
of
the
new
charges
were
known
to
the
government,
perhaps
not
to
the
second
prosecutor
but
to
the
government,
in
its
entirety
prior
to
the
may
24,
1979,
election
by
mr.
goodwin
of
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
no
question,
your
honor,
that
mr.
goodwin's
absence
from
the
jurisdiction
for
three
years,
his
failure
to
appear
at
trial,
is
obviously
a
justification
for
that
charge
and
perhaps
greater
charges.
the
factor
of
his
absence
from
the
jurisdiction
was
obviously
known
to
the
government
in
1976,
for
the
next
three
years
up
until
the
time
of
his
return
on
may
24,
1979.
at
that
time,
our
position
certainly
would
not
require
the
government
to
stand
still
or
to
stand
pat
on
those
charges
which
they
brought
three
years
ago.
they
were
entirely
able
to
bring
new
charges
at
that
time,
not
only
a
failure
to
appear
charge
but
greater
charges.
however--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do,
a
couple.
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
that's
speculative.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
if
the
government's
position
is
correct,
then
indeed
it
would
be
a
counterproductive
effect
to
our
application
in
this
case.
however,
we
believe,
first
of
all,
it's
speculative.
it's
certainly
unclear
at
least,
and
there's
certainly
no
empirical
data
establishing
that
that
in
a
great
majority
of
cases
is
not
what
happens
already.
second
of
all,
even
if
this
rule
went
through,
as
we
suggest,
this
court
follows
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
there
is
no
indication
that
that's
indeed
what
the
prosecution
will
do
in
the
future,
that
is
bring
the
most
serious
charges
at
the
outset.
perhaps
more
importantly,
as
your
honor
noted
in
your
dissent
in
bordenkircher
v.
hayes,
it
is
perhaps
far
preferable
to
require
the
government
to
do
just
that,
to
bring
the
charges
at
the
outset,
to
have
the
government
be
content
with
those
charges
it
first
brings
and
wants
to
justify
to
the
public,
to
have
out
in
the
open
their
charging
decision,
to
have
defendants
know
what
they're
in
for
in
the
beginning,
rather
than
behind
the
scenes
upping
the
ante
and
having
the
defendants
in
the
dark
as
to
what
they
face,
bring
the
most
serious--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
w.
spence
certainly--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--certainly
we
don't
agree...
certainly
we
would
not
ignore--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--well,
that's
certainly
part
of
it,
your
honor.
you
certainly
need--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--no,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
you
need
a
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
to
discourage
the
exercise
of
that
right.
you
also
need--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--the
fourth
circuit
clearly
did
not
rely
on
any
actual
vindictiveness.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
well,
there's
much,
much
more
to
the
case
than
merely
actual
vindictiveness.
this
court
in
both
the
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
blackledge
v.
perry
noted
obviously
the
primary
concern
of
actual
vindictiveness.
but
there
is
also
another
concern,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
other
defendants
will
be
chilled
in
their
exercise
of
these
rights,
particularly
the
exercise
of
a
jury
trial
right,
by
the
knowledge
that
the
stakes
can
be
increased
if
they
do
exercise
this
right.
there
is
this
secondary
goal
of
the
prophylactic
measure.
it
does
not
focus
only
on
actual
vindictiveness,
but
also
goes
to
remove
the
apprehension
of
vindictiveness.
the
objective
reality
of
vindictiveness
which
was
sought
to
be
proscribed
by
the
measure
in
blackledge
v.
perry
is
precisely
that
objective
reality
or
circumstances
that
exist
in
this
case
and
which
the
fourth
circuit
found
generate
a
realistic
hazard
of
vindictiveness
sufficient
at
that
point
to
generate
a
presumption
of
prosecutorial
misconduct.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
and
they
do
that
in
the
event
that
a
jury
trial
is
required?
mr.
paul
w.
spence
that,
your
honor,
brings
in
to
some
extent
the
notions
established
in
bordenkircher
v.
hayes,
and
that
is,
where
a
defendant
is
given
a
free
choice
and
full
notice
of
what
the
consequences
are,
then
perhaps
the
punitive
aspect
of
actual
vindictiveness
will
be
allowed.
in
the
situation
which
your
honor
posits,
i
believe
that
the
generalized
threat,
and
perhaps
even
the
vague
threat,
of
adding
charges
should
a
right
be
exercised
would
be
insufficient
to
bring
that
context
into
the
bordenkircher
v.
hayes
context
and
still
be
within
the
rationale
of
blackledge
v.
perry.
obviously,
we
recognize
the
difference
in
context
between
this
case
and
that
in
blackledge
v.
perry.
but
any
distinction
between
pretrial
and
post-trial
setting
is
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
it
reflects
on
the
prosecutorial
interest
in
discouraging
the
exercise
of
a
right.
we
do
not
argue,
and
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
state,
that
any
exercise
of
a
right
pretrial
followed
by
the
upping
of
the
ante
generates
a
presumption
of
prosecutorial
misconduct.
we
believe
that
is
not
their
holding.
we
do
not
urge
that
ruling
to
this
court.
rather,
we
only
state
what
blackledge
states,
and
that
is
when
that
scenario,
when
that
procedural
context
with
other
circumstances
generates
the
substantial
hazard
of
vindictiveness,
at
that
point
there
is
a
presumption
of
prosecutorial
misconduct,
at
which
point
the
government
must
justify
the
increase
in
charges.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
that
would
go
part
of
the
way,
justice
o'connor.
however,
blackledge
requires
one
step
further.
first
of
all,
it
requires
a
freedom
of
apprehension
of
actual
vindictiveness,
as
opposed
to
only
actual
vindictiveness.
more
importantly,
however,
i
think
the
rule
which
your
honor
advances
would
simply
generate
the
type
of
litigation,
the
type
of
inquiry
into
the
subjective
intent
of
judges
and
prosecutors,
which
this
court
in
pearce
and
perry
has
decided
is
just
not
appropriate.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
i
believe
with
respect
to
selective
prosecution
this
court
has
decided
to
require
defendants
to
make
the
preliminary
showing
insofar
as
the
substantial
hazard
of
vindictiveness.
that's
what
this
court
has
required
in
those
areas.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
it
has.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
i
believe
the
most
recent
one
in
which
this
court
found
invidious
selective
prosecution
was
in
the
wick
woe
case
sometime
ago,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
hopkins,
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
the
difficulty,
as
mentioned
just
recently,
in
exploration
of
the
actual
motivations
of
a
prosecutor
or
a
judge
is
no
less
significant
here
than
it
is
in
the
post-trial
setting,
and
certainly
warrants
the
application
of
the
prophylactic
measure
only
in
those
narrow
instances
where
the
realistic
likelihood
of
vindictiveness
is
present.
bordenkircher
v.
hayes,
frequently
and
consistently
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
this
case,
does
not
either
advance
or
support
its
position
with
respect
to
the
sole
importance
of
actual
vindictiveness
or
the
nonapplicability
of
blackledge
v.
perry
in
the
pretrial
setting.
the
bordenkircher
v.
hayes
decision
by
this
court
rests
on
the
express
determination
that
plea
bargaining
is
an
essential
component
to
the
administration
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
that
it
is
the
give
and
take
process
of
plea
bargaining,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
knows
what
he
is
in
for,
knows
the
consequences
of
his
elections
that
voids
that
process
of
any
punitive
aspects.
the
key
elements
are
those--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--your
honor,
if
in
this
case
or
in
any
case
such
as
this
the
prosecutor
said
if
you
exercise
your
right
to
a
jury
trial
we
will
then
do
a
to
you,
in
other
words,
a
specific
threat
as
to
what
they
would
do,
in
that
case
we
believe
bordenkircher
v.
hayes
would
control
and
in
effect
allow
that
actual
vindictiveness.
however,
the
distinction
between
blackledge
and
bordenkircher
and
between
this
case
and
the
situation
your
honor
advances
is
the
simple
fact
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
no
choice
as
a
matter
of
fact.
he
had
no
idea,
no
notice
that
if
he
exercised
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
these
new
and
substantially
higher
charges
would
be
brought
against
him.
that
simple
fact
completely
obviates
or
undermines
any
reliance
by
the
government
on
bordenkircher
v.
hayes.
we
submit
that
blackledge
v.
perry
stands
unaffected
by
this
court's
ruling
in
bordenkircher
v.
hayes,
requires
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
government
refers
to
ongoing
investigation
and
pretrial
preparation
that
provided
the
bases
for
more
serious
charges
against
mr.
goodwin.
however,
a
review
of
the
record
reveals
quite
simply
that
prior
to
the
return
of
the
defendant
to
hyattsville
for
trial
in
may
of
1979,
prior
to
the
government
in
effect
committing
itself
to
a
trial
on
the
petty
offense
and
misdemeanor
charges,
the
prosecution
had
that
information
which
it
now
asserts
justified
the
felony
indictment.
the
ongoing
investigation
which
is
spoken
of
by
the
petitioner
was
in
effect
completed
prior
to
may
24,
1979.
the
office
in
charge,
the
victim,
was
also
in
effect
the
investigating
agent.
he
had
found
out
about
mr.
goodwin's
record.
he
had
found
out
about
mr.
goodwin's
alleged
participation
in
narcotics
trafficking.
obviously,
the
government
at
the
time
prior
to
his
election
of
a
jury
trial
right
were
well
aware
of
his
flight,
were
well
aware
of
the
possibility
of
the
perjury
aspect
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
of
course
were
aware
of
the
seriousness
and
the
nature
of
the
charges.
all
these
factors
were
known
to
the
prosecution
prior
to
mr.
goodwin's
election
for
a
jury
trial,
yet
they
were
content
to
proceed
to
trial
at
that
time.
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
the
prosecutor
and
the
prosecution
to
reassess
the
charges.
certainly
in
no
way
did
the
defendant
preclude
any
opportunity
for
such
re-evaluation.
all
the
prosecution
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases
need
do
to
avoid
the
limitations
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
of
this
court
in
blackledge
v.
perry
is
to
make
informed
appropriate
decisions
to
prosecute
at
the
outset.
respondent's
position
is
simply
that
the
decision
below
is
required
by
this
court's
previous
holdings
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
blackledge
vs.
perry.
we
are
not
arguing...
and
as
i
believe
i
made
clear
already...
that
the
prophylactic
rule
is
always
applicable
in
the
pretrial
setting.
rather,
it
is
applicable
in
the
pretrial
setting
as
the
post-trial
setting
only
when
a
substantial
hazard
of
vindictiveness
is
set
up
by
the
circumstances.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
or
to
continue
a
rule
that
will
generate
inappropriate
litigation.
first
of
all,
only
narrow
circumstances
will
justify
an
inquiry,
will
justify
the
application
of
the
presumption
of
prosecutorial
vindictiveness.
further,
this
court
or
other
courts
certainly
would
be
entitled
to
fashion
a
preliminary
procedure
such
as
that
fashioned
in
franks
v.
delaware
where
the
defendant
would
have
an
obligation
to
make
a
substantial
preliminary
showing
requiring
such
an
inquiry
which
this
court
is
concerned
about.
perhaps
even
more
importantly,
if
this
court
eschews
reliance
on
blackledge
because
there
is
no
actual
vindictiveness
in
this
case,
this
court
and
other
courts
will
be
left
with
a
standard
which
will
require
explorations
into
the
subjective
intent
and
motivations
of
prosecutors.
every
word,
every
deed,
every
action
of
the
prosecutor
will
come
under
scrutiny.
this
would
be
precisely
the
type
of
litigation,
be
precisely
the
unseemly
task
which
this
court
tried
to
avoid
in
blackledge
v.
perry
that
would
now
come
about
by
only
requiring
actual
vindictiveness.
finally,
we
are
not
advocating
that
this
position
will
unduly
restrict
prosecutorial
discretion.
obviously
blackledge
v.
perry
to
some
degree
imposes
a
restraint
in
the
name
of
due
process
upon
the
prosecution.
however,
as
in
this
case,
it
is
not
unreasonable
restraint
if
proper
prosecutorial
procedure
is
followed
at
the
outset.
we
are
not
asking
for
any
change
in
procedure.
the
present
system
and
procedures
allows
for
deliberation
by
the
prosecution.
this
court's
opinion
in
lavasco,
or
united
states
v.
lavasco
certainly
establishes
that
the
prosecution
is
under
no
specific
or
strict
time
restraints
with
respect
to
the
bringing
of
charges.
there
is
certainly
plenty
of
time
generally,
certainly
plenty
of
time
in
this
case,
given
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
did
have
the
information
available
to
it
prior
to
the
defendant's
election
of
a
jury
trial
to
make
a
decision
that
it
would
be
content
to
live
with
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
your
honor,
we...
no,
no,
sir.
we
believe
that
if
new
information
arises
subsequent
to
the
exercise
of
procedural
right
that
legitimately
and
justifies
the
bringing
of
new
charges,
then
it's
permissible.
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
which
does
indeed
hold
that
the
only
way
the
prosecutor
could
have
justified
the
increased
charges
in
this
case
was
to
show
that
the
charges
could
not
have
been
brought
at
the
outset
is
a
simple
recognition
of
the
fact
that
that
was
the
only
explanation
in
this
case.
the
information
supporting
the
felony
indictment
was
known
to
the
prosecution
prior
to
may
24,
1979.
it
was
known
through
officer
morrissette
and
the
prosecutor
at
hyattsville,
this
information
which
the
second
prosecutor
ultimately
relied
upon
for
the
bringing
of
a
felony
indictment.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
that
situation
where
subsequent
to
the
exercise
of
a
jury
trial
right
new
information
was
garnered.
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
right,
but
this
court
need
not
go
so
far
as
the
fourth
circuit
did
to
affirm
its
decision.
the
facts
before
this
court
and
before
the
fourth
circuit
are
very
narrow.
a
situation
where
an
individual
will
go
before
the
magistrate
and
then
exercise
a
jury
trial
right
with
potential
for
higher
charges
is
a
fairly
rare
one.
however,
the
point
in
this
case
is
simply
that
due
to
the
officer's
investigation,
the
prosecutor's
role
at
hyattsville,
indeed,
the
second
prosecutor's
knowledge
of
some
of
the
background
facts
prior
to
the
exercise
of
the
jury
trial
right,
there
were
no
new
circumstances,
no
new
evidence
that
would
have
justified
the
increased
charges.
if
there
had
been,
we
probably
would
not
be
here,
such
charges
would
have
been
justified.
certainly
in
your
hypothesis,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
believe
the
added
charges
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
your
honor,
we
believe
the--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--we
believe
under
these
circumstances,
your
honor,
due
process
of
law
would
outweigh
the
interest
in
allowing
the
government
to
reassess
the
decision
of
one
of
its
own.
certainly
the
government
was
acting
as
a
unit
here.
there
is
no
valid
contention,
we
believe,
that
simply
because
the
first
prosecutor
was
located
in
hyattsville,
away
from
the
baltimore
prosecutor's
office,
that
that
should
justify
a
re-evaluation
or
an
entirely
new
assessment
of
the
procedures.
referring
this
court
to
the
plea
bargaining
cases,
obviously
one
individual
must
know
what
the
other
individual
is
doing;
the
left
hand
must
know
what
the
right
hand
is
doing.
the
prosecution
operates
as
a
unit.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
government--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
particularly.
for
example,
again
referring
to
the
plea
bargaining
cases,
i
think
it
can
be
stated
with
accuracy
that
should
one
of
100
prosecutors
make
a
firm
plea
agreement,
certainly
any
of
the
other
99
prosecutors
will
be
bound
by
that.
we
believe
the
situation
here
is
no
different.
mr.
paul
w.
spence
well,
there
certainly
are
elements
of
due
process
that
are
implicated
in
both
situations,
we
believe,
your
honor.
and
certainly--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--there
are
certainly,
your
honor,
double
jeopardy
implications
in
this
entire
analysis.
however--
mr.
paul
w.
spence
--due
process
rationale
advanced
by
this
court,
although
perhaps
having
implications
of
double
jeopardy
principles,
is
not
confined
by
the
double
jeopardy
approach.
indeed,
a
significant
difference
would
be
that
if
a
prosecutor
is
negligent
or
does
make
a
mistake
the
first
time
around,
the
defendant
does
not
walk
free
and
clear
as
in
a
double
jeopardy
situation
where
if
double
jeopardy
applies,
the
defendant
may
be
free
to
go.
in
this
situation
the
negligence
would
only
go
so
far
as
to
free
the
defendant
of
the
more
serious
charges.
we
believe
that
if
the
information
is
known
to
the
government,
if
the
one
out
of
100
attorneys,
chief
justice
burger,
are
aware
of
the
facts,
that
the
interest
in
encouraging
proper
prosecutorial
procedure
should
be
considered
by
this
court,
and
that
is
mistakes
occur,
as
perhaps
in
this
case
occurred
when
the
prosecutor
did
not
act
on
that
information
to
which
he
had
access
to
and
to
which
he
knew,
that
any
cost
because
of
that
mistake
should
be
borne
by
the
government,
that
the
appropriate
response
is
not
the
sacrifice
of
due
process
interests
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
blackledge
v.
perry.
thank
you.
