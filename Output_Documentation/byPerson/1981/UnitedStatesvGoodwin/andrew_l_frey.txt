mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
sure
i
can't
improve
on
the
arguments
that
were
given
in
finley
against
murray,
so
i
will
stick
to
the
goodwin
case.
this
is
a
case
that
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--oh,
yes.
are
the
microphones
there?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
was
asked
by
the
marshall
not
to
move
the
microphones.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
all
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
is
that
any
better?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
case
began
in
february
1976,
when
a
park
police
officer
stopped
respondent
for
speeding
on
the
baltimore-washington
parkway.
the
officer
spotted
a
suspicious
package
under
the
armrest
in
respondent's
car
and
asked
him
to
lift
up
the
armrest.
instead,
respondent
got
into
his
car,
placed
it
suddenly
in
gear,
and
roared
off,
knocking
the
officer
onto
the
rear
of
respondent's
car
and
then
onto
the
highway.
the
officer
recovered,
got
into
his
vehicle,
and
gave
chase
at
high
speeds,
but
was
unable
to
apprehend
respondent.
the
officer
thereupon
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
magistrate's
court
in
hyattsville,
charging
a
number
of
petty
and
misdemeanor
offenses,
including
a
misdemeanor
assault
charge
under
section
113(d)
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
a
warrant
was
issued
for
respondent's
arrest
and
he
was
apprehended
several
weeks
later.
he
appeared
at
a
preliminary
hearing
at
which
he
was
bound
over
for
trial
before
the
magistrate
and
released
on
bond.
he
failed
to
appear
for
the
trial
and
he
was
not
found
until
three
years
later,
when
the
magistrate
was
advised
that
he
was
in
jail
in
virginia.
arrangements
were
made
to
transport
respondent
to
hyattsville,
where
the
magistrate's
court
is
located,
and
he
appeared
there
on
may
24th,
1979.
on
that
day
cases
in
the
magistrate's
court
were
being
handled
by
an
attorney
from
the
antitrust
division
who
was
serving
on
a
two-week
detail
in
the
magistrate's
court.
she
conferred
briefly
with
the
park
police
officer--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
think
this
is
a
training
program
for
people
who
want
a
little
court
experience.
she
conferred
briefly
with
the
police
officer
who
had
filed
the
complaint
and
been
the
victim
of
the
assault,
and
she
also
discussed
with
respondent's
counsel
the
possibility
of
a
plea
bargain.
however,
respondent
indicated
that
he
was
not
interested
in
a
plea
bargain
and
instead
demanded
a
jury
trial
on
the
charges.
since
at
the
time
the
magistrate
had
no
power
to
conduct
jury
trials,
the
case
was
perforce
referred
to
the
district
court
in
baltimore,
where
assistant
united
states
attorney
norton
was
assigned
to
handle
the
case.
as
a
result
of
mr.
norton's
reevaluation
of
the
case
in
the
course
of
his
preparation
for
trial,
the
original
charges
were
superseded
in
an
indictment
containing
the
felony
charge
of
assaulting
a
federal
officer
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
118.
it
is
the
validity
of
that
charge
that
is
the
subject
of
inquiry
today.
in
response
to
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
on
vindictive
prosecution
grounds,
the
prosecutor
filed
an
affidavit
explaining
his
reasons
for
seeking
the
felony
indictment,
which
were
as
follows:
first,
his
assessment
of
the
gravity
of
respondent's
conduct
in
connection
with
the
commission
of
the
offense
itself;--
second,
respondent's
criminal
record,
which
showed
a
lengthy
prior
history
of
violent
crime;--
third,
his
judgment
that
the
assault
on
the
park
police
officer
was
related
to
a
major
narcotics
transaction;--
fourth,
his
belief
that
respondent
had
committed
perjury
at
the
preliminary
hearing
in
1976
when
he
testified
that
he
had
been
in
atlanta
and
not
on
the
baltimore-washington
parkway
at
the
time
of
the
incident;--
and
finally,
respondent's
flight
to
avoid
trial
on
the
initial
charges.
the
prosecutor
further
averred
that
his
decision
to
seek
the
felony
indictment
was
not
motivated
in
any
way
by,
nor
did
he
ever
consider,
respondent's
request
for
a
jury
trial
in
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
felony
assault
charge,
finding
that
the
prosecutor
had
adequately
dispelled
any
appearance
of
retaliatory
intent.
respondent
was
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment
on
the
charge.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
simple
fact
of
the
return
of
a
more
severe
charge
after
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
created
an
appearance
of
vindictiveness
that
establishes
"a
per
se
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
requiring
dismissal
of
the
new
charges.
"
it
further
held
that
the
fatal
appearance
of
vindictiveness
could
not
be
rebutted
by
any
explanation
of
the
prosecutor
other
than
a
showing
that
the
increased
charges
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
first
instance.
now,
before
turning
to
my
argument
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
preliminary
observations
about
the
case.
the
first
is,
i
think
the
court
should
appreciate
the
sweeping
effect
of
the
fourth
circuit's
rule,
because
the
rule
is
really
tantamount
to
saying
that
in
all
but
a
very
small
proportion
of
cases
the
initial
charge
that's
brought
by
the
prosecutor
cannot
be
increased.
all
that's
necessary
to
trigger
the
appearance
of
vindictiveness
and
the
almost
irrebuttable
presumption
of
a
due
process
violation
under
the
fourth
circuit's
holding
is
the
exercise
of
a
right
by
the
defendant.
and
in
a
criminal
case
rights
start
being
exercised
fast
and
furious
shortly
after
the
initial
filing
of
the
initial
charges.
and
the
kind
of
explanation
that
the
fourth
circuit
would
accept
to
rebut
the
appearance
of
vindictiveness
and
to
show
that
there
was
no
retaliatory
motive
is
strictly
limited
to
what
would
be
an
extremely
small
class
of
cases.
now,
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
preliminarily
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
vindictive
prosecution
due
process
prohibition
is
not
to
protect
generally
against
unjustified
charging
decisions.
the
protection
against
abuse
of
the
prosecutor's
discretion
generally
in
charging
decisions
is
the
grand
jury
and
the
trial
and
the
judicial
procedures
incident
thereto,
as
well
as
the
political
pressures
and
the
supervision
within
the
executive
branch
over
the
prosecutor's
conduct.
the
purpose
of
the
vindictive
prosecution
doctrine
is
specifically
to
protect
against
a
vindictive
retaliation
for
the
exercise
of
a
right
by
the
defendant.
now,
here
it's
important
to
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
readily
concluded,
in
their
words,
that
there
was
no
actual
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
and
respondent
has
never
alleged
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
it's
absolutely
clear
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
jury
demand
was
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
increase
the
charges.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
would--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
of
vindictiveness.
if
we're
talking
about
a
situation
like
bordenkircher,
where
there
was
a
retaliation
for
the
refusal
to
plead
guilty
as
part
of
the
plea
bargaining
process,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
further
inquiry.
but
we
would
agree
that
in
some
circumstances
the
defendant
could
make
a
showing
that
an
increase
in
charges
was...
appeared
to
be
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
but
i
think
it's
an
important
part
of
our
argument
that
the
circumstances
in
which
there
might
be
a
proper
showing
to
require
such
an
inquiry
are
quite
limited.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
argument
with
regard
to
the
pretrial
situation
us
essentially
that
there
should
be
no
presumption
of
vindictiveness,
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
and
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
been
doing
in
what
we
think
is
a
misinterpretation
of
pearce
and
perry
is
to
equate
the
mere
exercise
of
a
right
followed
by
an
increase
in
charges
with
a
presumed
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
government.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
has
any
place
in
the
analysis
of
these
cases.
i
think
we
are
not
prepared
to
say,
and
we
certainly
don't
need
to
for
purposes
of
this
case,
to
go
as
far
as
judge
meritt
went
in
the
andrews
case
and
say
that
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
the
prosecutor
to
be
vindictive
in
the
pretrial
context.
we're
not
urging
that
upon
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not.
let
me
just
explain
how
i
view
the
structure
of
the
issues
and
perhaps
our
position
will
become
clearer.
it
seems
to
me
that
every
due
process
vindictiveness
claim
essentially
presents
two
questions.
the
first
part...
the
first
question
is
whether
the
defendant
who
is
making
the
claim
has
shown
enough
to
make
out
a
prime
facie
case
of
a
due
process
violation
and
to
shift
to
the
prosecutor
the
burden
of
explaining
his
actions.
of
course,
if
not
enough
has
been
shown,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
matter
and
the
motion
should
be
denied.
the
second
question,
if
enough
has
been
shown
to
call
for
an
explanation
by
the
prosecutor,
is
what
kinds
of
explanations
should
be
deemed
acceptable
to
rebut
such
a
prima
facie
case.
now,
here
the
question
is
whether
the
respondent,
by
simply
showing
that
he
demanded
a
jury
trial
and
that
at
some
time
subsequent
to
that
demand
more
severe
charges
were
returned,
did
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
vindictive
prosecution.
the
court
of
appeals,
importing
the
principles
of
pearce
and
perry
to
the
pretrial
context,
has
held
that
those
facts
suffice
to
create
a
presumption
if
vindictiveness,
in
effect.
we
say
that
in
the
pretrial
context
there
should
instead
be
a
presumption
of
regularity
in
the
prosecutor's
action
and
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
defendant
to
show
concrete
and
specific
facts
from
which
a
conclusion
of
actual
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
can
be
drawn.
now,
this
presumption
of
regulatory
in
prosecutorial
charging
decisions
is
the
rule
in
every
other
context
of
which
i
am
aware.
this
is
the
only
exception.
and
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
treatment
of
selective
prosecution
claims.
these
claims
are
quite
analogous,
it
seems
to
me,
to
vindictive
prosecution
claims.
surely
the
bringing
of
a
prosecution
on
account
of
a
person's
race
or
political
views
or
religion
is
every
bit
as
invidious
a
practice
as
bringing
a
prosecution
to
retaliate
against
the
exercise
of
a
right.
equally,
the
possibility
of
an
invidiously
discriminatory
motive
underlying
a
prosecution
is
present
in
virtually
every
case.
yet,
it
has
never
been
thought,
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
that
those
things
combined
are
not
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
to
require
the
prosecutor
to
come
in
and
explain
his
reasons
for
his
actions,
let
alone
rigidly
restricting
the
reasons
for
his
actions
to
practically
nothing
that
can
justify
it.
now,
in
pearce
and
perry
the
court
confronted
cases
in
which
vindictiveness
appeared
to
be
the
most
likely
explanation
for
the
increased
penalty
exposure
of
the
defendants,
and
indeed
cases
in
which
no
non-vindictive
explanation
was
ever
tendered.
in
fact
in
the
rice
case,
which
was
the
companion
of
pearce,
the
district
court
found
actual
vindictive
retaliation
against
the
appeal,
and
in
pearce...
in
the
pearce
case
the
court
described
the
state's
assertion
as
nothing
more
than
the
naked
power
to
do
what
it
did.
now,
in
the
pretrial
context
we
submit
that
the
circumstances
are
entirely
different,
and
this
difference
consists
principally
of
two
elements:
the
first
element
is
that
the
exercise
of
rights
by
defendants
in
pretrial
contexts
is
an
entirely
commonplace
event.
it
is
not
likely
to
provoke
a
vindictive
or
retaliatory
response
by
the
prosecutor
that
the
defendant
has
pleaded
not
guilty,
that
he's
asked
for
a
jury
trial,
that
he's
moved
to
suppress
evidence,
that
he
sought
a
continuance
or
asked
for
a
severance
or
a
change
of
venue.
these
are
everyday
occurrences,
everyday
grist
to
the
prosecutor's
mill,
and
to
presume
that
the
prosecutor
would
react
in
an
unprofessional
and
unfair
manner
by
retaliating
against
that
kind
of
occurrence
is
simply
contrary
to
common
sense.
in
fact,
i
submit
that
the
prosecutor
generally
would
be
astounded
if
a
defendant
exercised
no
rights
in
the
pretrial
context.
now,
not
only
is
the
exercise
of
a
right
by
a
defendant
in
the
pretrial
context
therefore
not
a
likely
occasion
for
a
retaliatory
response
by
the
prosecutor,
but
equally
the
process
of
preparation
for
the
trial
itself
will
inevitably
give
the
prosecutor
a
better
grasp
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
can
be
expected
in
some
cases
to
reveal
reasons
for
concluding
that
the
initial
charges
were
too
lenient.
so
that
this
is
again
a
context
in
which
it
is
not
unlikely.
superseding
indictments
are
common.
sometimes
the
initial
severity
of
charges
is
reduced
because
the
prosecutor
concludes
in
his
pretrial
preparation
that
they
were
too
severe.
sometimes
the
severity
is
increased
because
he
concludes
that
it
was
too
lenient.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct,
that
is
our
position.
our
position
is
essentially
threefold:
first
of
all,
that
the
mere
showing
of
the
exercise
of
a
right
followed
by
an
increase
in
charges
is
not
enough
to
make
out
the
prima
facie
case
of
prosecutorial
vindictiveness;--
secondly,
that
looking
at
the...
if
you
went
beyond
that,
there's
nothing
about
the
circumstances
of
this
case
beyond
those
bare
facts
that
might
make
out...
let
me
back
up.
our
view
is
that
there
should
be
no
presumption
from
these
facts
that
the
prosecutor
acted
vindictively.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant,
unaided
by
a
presumption,
could
not
make
a
showing
that
in
a
particular
case
the
prosecutor
said,
i'll
fix
that
sob's
wagon.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
would
think
that
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
it
could
be
demonstrated
from
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
that
the
prosecutor
acted
vindictively.
he
may
have
said
something.
that
would
be
one
category
of
case.
or
his
behavior
may
otherwise
appear
so
inexplicable
from
looking
at
the
record
of
the
case...
this
is
before
asking
him
for
an
explanation...
that
the
only
conclusion
the
court
could
draw
was
that
he
was
retaliating
against
the
exercise
of
a
right.
but
our
basic
proposition
is
that
normally
in
the
pretrial
context
that
is
simply
not
a
reasonable
conclusion.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
doing
is
indulging
a
presumption
in
these
cases,
and
in
the
law
of
evidence
a
presumption
is
something
that
says,
if
facts
a
and
b
are
established
it
is
sufficiently
likely
that
fact
c
follows
that
we
will
presume
fact
c
and
place
the
burden
on
the
opponent
of
that
fact
to
disprove
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
say,
what
is
common
is
for
a
prosecutor
to
increase
charges
after
they
have
initially
been
brought.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
neither
normal
nor
abnormal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
it's
neither
normal
nor
abnormal.
it's
simply,
the
demand
for
a
jury
trial
is
simply
not
likely
to
trigger
any
particular
response
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
submission
is
that
it
is
not
warranted
to
presume
from
the
mere
fact
that
respondent
asked
for
a
trial
trial
and
that
subsequent
charges
were
filed
that
there
was
vindictive
prosecution,
and
therefore
there
is...
he
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
could
just
ask
the
prosecutor
why
did
you
do
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
submission
is
that
you're
not,
but
that
if
you
are
the
kind
of
explanation
that
the
prosecutor
gave
here
is
satisfactory.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
the
defendant
is
within
his
rights
to
demand
an
inquiry
into
the
subject.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
not
in
this...
our
position
is,
not
in
this
context.
and
let
me
turn
to
the
practical
aspects
of
this
problem
to
explain
just
why
we
think
this
is
so.
when
the...
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
it's
almost
inconceivable,
except
in
a
case
in
which
there's
already
been
plea
negotiations
and
the
defendant
has
agreed
to
plead
guilty
before
any
charges
are
actually
filed,
it's
virtually
inconceivable
that
rights
will
not
have
been
exercised
by
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
by
the
time
a
superseding
indictment
is
returned.
so
when
we
say,
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
have
it
inquired
into,
what
we
are
essentially
saying
is
that
every
time
a
superseding
indictment
has
been
filed
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
call
upon
the
court,
and
the
court
has
the
duty
to
respond
to
this
call,
get
in
the
witnesses,
get
in
the
prosecutor,
make
the
prosecutor
give
an
explanation,
have
a
hearing,
in
the
ninth
circuit
have
a
pretrial
appeal.
the
amount
of
resources,
the
amount
of
delay
that
is
potentially
involved
is
much
too
great
for
the
problem
that
this
procedure
is
designed
to
guard
against.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
may
or
may
not
take
very
long,
depending
on
the
procedures
that
ensue.
i
assume
normally
a
prosecutor
would
have
no
objection
to
satisfying
the
judge's
curiosity.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
the
judge
probably
has
a
right
to
ask
him
virtually
anything
that
he'd
like
to
ask
him.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he's
probably
likely
to
respond.
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
yes,
justice
marshall,
i
think
he
should
respond.
but
i
think
the
question
that
the
court
has
to
focus
on
is
whether
the
defendant
has
the
right
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
had
in
this
case,
to
have
this
hearing
at
which
the
prosecutor
is
essentially
gagged.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
will
accept
that
the
prosecutor
should
answer
that
question.
but
i'm
not
sure
what
consequences
would
follow--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
that's
not
the
issue,
justice
marshall,
in
this
case.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
prosecutor
has
to
give
an
answer.
the
issue
is
whether,
when
he
acts,
he
is
presumed
to
act
vindictively
and
he
has
a
heavy
burden
of
rebutting
that
presumption,
and
whether
his
hands
should
be
tied
behind
his
back--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
they
still
reversed
the
respondent's
conviction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
did
say
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we're
not...
i
think
we'll
ask
you
to
look
behind
what
they
said
or
look
at
it
through
specially
colored
glasses.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
look
behind
what
they
said.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
this,
justice
stevens.
we
would
far
prefer
that
procedure
to
the
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
prohibits
explanation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
while
it
may
be
unseemly
in
some
way
to
have
the
prosecutor
get
on
the
stand
and
to
have
the
judge
and
the
defendant
probing
his
motives
in
making
a
charging
decision,
it
is
far
preferable
to
throwing
out
the
case
the
prosecutor--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
there
probably
could
be.
that
is,
we
have
not
taken
the
position
that
no
matter
what
the
prosecutor
does
or
why
he
does
it
in
the
pretrial
context
there
would
never
be
a
due
process
vindictiveness
violation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
that
in
general,
the
mere
sequence
of
the
exercise
of
a
right
followed
at
some
point
in
the
future
by
an
increase
charge
is
not
enough.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
he
should
have
denied
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
without
any
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
don't
wish
to
say
that
he's
not
entitled
to
ask
the
prosecutor--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
can
also
conceive
in
selective
prosecutions
of
situations.
but
what
is
necessary...
and
the
same
rule
ought
to
be
true
here...
is
a
very
specific
showing
of
particular
facts
by
the
defendant
from
which
the
most
reasonable
conclusion
is
that
there
has
been
a
vindictive
retaliation
by
the
prosecutor.
if
he's
done
that,
then
i
think
it
may
be
appropriate
to
call
upon
the
prosecutor
to
respond.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
this
is
like
in
a
civil
case
if
you
file
a
complaint
which
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief...
fails
to
state
facts
that
make
out
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
you're
not
entitled
to
a
trial
to
see
whether
something
might
be
there.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
position,
and
that
is
our
position
generally,
not
just
about
this
case
but
about
most
of
the
vindictive
prosecution
cases
that
we've
lost,
particularly
in
the
ninth
circuit,
where
nothing
more
has
been
shown
than
the
exercise
of
a
right
followed
by
an
increase
in
charges.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
what
we
are
referring
to
there
is
not
the
notion
that
due
process
applies
to
vindictive
responses,
but
the
presumption
of
vindictiveness
and
the
prophylactic
rule
of
pearce
and
perry,
which
restrict
the
kinds
of
explanations
that
can
be
offered.
those
are
the
things
that
we
say
don't
belong
in
the
pretrial
context.
we
don't
say
there
can
never
be
a
due
process
claim.
but
what
pearce
and
perry
did
was
they
said,
when
you've
shown
an
appeal
followed
by
an
increase
in
charges
or
an
increase
in
penalty
exposure,
that's
it,
the
prosecution
is
finished,
due
process
is
violated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
he
has
to
overcome
a
presumption
of
regularity
in
the
prosecutor's
charging
decision.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
have
to
take
strenuous
issue
with
several
characterizations
of
my
colleague
about
what
is
going
on
here.
and
the
first
of
these
has
to
do
with
his
confusion
of
the
prosecution
with
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecution,
in
his
view,
includes
the
police.
let's
keep
in
mind...
and
although
i
don't
want
to
concentrate
too
much
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case...
these
initial
charges
were
brought
by
a
police
officer.
now,
the
prosecutor
who
allegedly
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
make
a
binding
decision...
and
let
me
say
this
is
not
just
punishing
the
government
if
you
don't
allow
the
increase
in
charges,
but
punishing
the
public
at
large...
this
is
a
prosecutor
who
was
assigned
to
the
hyattsville
magistrate
court,
and
what
happens
there
is
she
walks
in
in
the
morning,
she
is
handed
20
or
30
files
of
cases
that
are
on
the
docket
that
day,
she
struggles
as
best
she
can
with
that.
the
idea
that
the
government
should
be
bound
by
what
happened
at
that
initial
proceeding
and
should
be
barred
from
bringing
what
are
otherwise
entirely
appropriate
charges
seems
to
me
quite
indefensible.
now,
let
me
say
for
example,
suppose
the
u.s.
attorney
had
a
policy
that
he
announced...
and
we
don't
need
to
go
this
far,
but
suppose
he
had
a
policy
that
said
whenever
a
case
is
going
to
go
to
trial
we
are
going
to
assign
a
prosecutor
to
review
the
initial
charge
with
great
care
to
determine
whether
it
was
too
severe
or
too
lenient
or
whether
it
should
be
changed.
this
is
announced
policy.
now,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
such
a
policy
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
yet
that
is
the
inescapable
conclusion
if
you
agree
with
my
colleague
and
with
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
let
me
turn
to
this
question
of
whether
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
only
one
of
a
narrow
category
of
cases
in
which
there
is
a
substantial
hazard
of
a
vindictive
response.
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
one
of
the
most
routine,
common
occurrences
in
a
criminal
case.
if
that
is
enough
to
cause
a
prosecutor
to
retaliate
vindictively
and
out
of
spite
against
the
defendant,
then
any
exercise
of
a
right
by
a
defendant
at
the
pretrial
stage
is
going
to
be
enough.
now,
in
fact,
the
prosecutor...
the
respondent
says
in
his
brief
it
is
a
lot
of
work
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
to
try
a
case
instead
of
having
it
tried
in
magistrate's
court.
that
does
not
distinguish
the
case
from
colten
v.
kentucky
where
it
is
a
lot
of
work
for
the
judge
to
have
to
try
the
case
at
the
second
level
when,
if
the
defendant
did
not
seek
a
trial
de
novo,
the
judge
would
not
be
burdened
with
that
extra
effort.
also,
with
respect
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
the
court
in
colten
said
precisely
the
same
thing.
they
said
that
the
first
level
judge
was
likely
to
impose
a
higher
sentence
if
he
was
aware
that
the
sentence
he
was
imposed
would
limit
the
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
if
a
trial
de
novo
was
sought.
the
same
kind
of
thing
is
going
on
here.
the
prosecutor
plainly
has
incentives
to
bring
higher
charges
where
the
prosecutor
himself
has
brought
the
initial
charges
and
not,
as
here,
a
police
officer.
and
also
i
might
say
that
from
talking
to
prosecutors
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
we
have
had
most
of
our
vindictive
prosecution
case
and
most
of
our
losses,
there
is
unquestionably
a
chilling
effect
on
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
re-evaluate
the
case
because
if
even,
no
matter
how
appropriate
they
may
feel
some
superseding
or
changed
charge
is,
they
know
that
if
they
bring
that
charge
there's
going
to
be
a
full
dress
hearing
in
the
district
court,
followed
by
an
appeal,
and
it
is
just
more
grief
than
it's
worth,
and
it's
too
bad
that
the
appropriate
charges
can't
be
brought,
but
in
most
cases
that
is
the
result
of
a
rule
like
this.
now,
i
also
wanted
to
point
out
that
respondent
has
really
drawn
back
from
the
court
of
appeals
rule
as
to
what
kind
of
justifications
are
acceptable
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
would
have
to
show
that
the
charges
could
not
have
been
brought,
and
by
that
i
think
they
meant
we
would
have
to
show
that
we
didn't
know
or
have
evidence
of
some
aspect
of
the
offense
behavior
itself.
in
this
case
we
knew
all
the
facts
about
the
offense,
but
there
were
additional
facts
that
came
along
later
on
that
properly
entered
the
prosecutor's
discretion
and
judgment
that
the
fourth
circuit
would
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
would
not
recommend
to
prosecutors
that
they
do
that,
but
that
is
where
the
court
would
be
driving
them
with
such
a
ruling,
yes.
