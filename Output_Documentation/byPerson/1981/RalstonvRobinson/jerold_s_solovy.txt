mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
first
to
address
justice
blackmun's
question
of
mootness,
because
mr.
robinson
and
i
sort
of
feel
like
the
baseball
player
who
came
up
from
the
minors
to
the
big
leagues,
and
then
a
baseball
strike
is
called,
and
mr.
robinson
having
struggled
this
long
to
get
his
yca-mandated
treatment
as
directed
by
congress,
i
hate
to
see
him
lose
it.
number
one,
the
mootness
argument
presumes
that
this
court
will
not
act
expeditiously.
i
will
not
indulge
in
that
presumption.
but
if
one
were
to
indulge
that
presumption,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
january
1982,
mr.
robinson
will
only
be
conditionally
released
from
this
yca
sentence.
at
that
point
he
will
start
serving
his
adult
sentence,
and
should
he
be
paroled
within
two
years,
he
would
still
be
subject
to
the
yca
sentence
and
could
be
called
back
into
the
yca
system.
now,
a
lot
of
questions
have
been
asked
by
the
court--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
quite
to
the
contrary,
with
all
respect,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
all
right.
well,
let's
take...
the
government
says
that
mr.
robinson
is
a
hardened
criminal,
and
he
must
be
kept
in
the
most
maximum
confinement
possible,
namely
marion,
but
yet
when
mr.
robinson
wound
his
way
up
to
the
seventh
circuit,
the
bureau
of
prisons
started
thinking
about
its
obligations,
and
they
transferred
him
to
the
memphis
facility,
which
is
a
minimum...
a
medium
security,
and
then
to
butner,
which
is
an
administrative
facility.
now,
at
butner
we
lodged
with
the
court
his
current
report,
where
they
say
he
requires
a
minimum
of
supervision,
his
attitude
is
positive,
he
interacts
well,
he
does
his
job
well,
he
has
completed
courses,
and
that
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do
when
they
passed
the
yca.
under
the
yca,
a
person
could
get
a
20-year
sentence.
that
means
that
the
trial
judge
thinks
that
this
person
is
a
hard
core
case.
he
takes
a
long
time
to
be
rehabilitated.
the
whole
purpose--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that,
justice
marshall,
of
course,
is
what
congress
gave
to
the
trial
court.
each
time
that
that
defendant
came
before
the
trial
judge,
so
long
as
he--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes,
i
am
talking
about
any
person--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--oh,
no,
the
court
is
never
under--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--justice
marshall,
this
court--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--this
court
has
mandated
the
answer
in
dorszynski.
so
long
as
the
person
is
under
the
age
of
22,
the
trial
judge
must
make
a
specific
no
benefit
finding.
you
take,
for
example--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
if
i
were
the
trial
judge,
i
would
make
the
finding
of
no
benefit.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
there
is
a
world
of
difference,
because
mr.
robinson
was
judged
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case
to
require
ten
years
of
rehabilitative
treatment
to
straighten
himself
out,
and
i
have
to
back
away
from
the
question
that
when
you
read
the
government's
brief,
the
court
and
i,
until
i
start
reading
the
cases,
are
sitting
in
a
never-never
land.
the
bureau
of
prisons
says,
listen
to
our
expertise,
and
it
is
impractical
to
mix
these
people
together,
but
this
system
doesn't
exist.
there
is
no
yca
treatment.
there
is
no
yca
system.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
couldn't
agree
with
that
more.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
exactly
the--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--not
at
all.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
twenty-five
years
under
the
yca.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
government
sets
it
forth
in
its
brief,
and
there
are
quite
a
number
of
them.
i
don't
remember
the
exact
figures,
but
there
are
quite
a
number
of
long--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--percentagewise,
i
would
say
the
long
sentences
are
about
15
to
20
percent,
and
of
course
the
answer
that
congress
gave
to
these
difficult
prisoners,
and
congress
envisioned
this,
is
found
right
in
the
statute,
at
section
5011.
it
says
"classes
of
committed
youth
offenders
shall
be
segregated
according
to
their
needs
of
treatment.
"
so
congress
knew
that
when
you
gave
a
youth
offender
20,
25
years'
worth
correction
sentence
that
there
might
be
problems,
and
it
said
that
you
could
house
those
youth
offenders
according
to
their
needs
for
treatment.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--because
marion
is
a
penitentiary,
and
marion
does
not
afford
what
congress
mandated
should
be
afforded,
which
was
rehabilitative
treatment.
now,
the
bureau
of
prisons
says
that
the
youth
corrections
act
is
passe,
and
therefore
we
won't
enforce
it.
the
bureau
of
prisons
likes
to
mix
the
adult
offenders
with
the
youthful
offenders,
and
they
think
that
prevents
violence,
but
that
is
exactly
contrary
to
what
congress
said.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
the
direct
testimony
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
watts
versus
hadden,
bell
versus
johnson,
brown
versus
carlson,
and
as
they
say,
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
are
much
more
direct
in
their
testimony
in
the
litigation
than
they
are
in
the
briefs
filed
with
the
court.
in
watts
versus
hadden,
the
district
judge
held
as
follows,
and
this
is
469
federal
supplement
234.
i
think
this
is
a
rather
astounding
statement.
there
is
an
incredible
irony
in
reading
the
supreme
court's
careful
articulation
of
the
policy,
purposes,
and
procedures
of
the
yca
in
the
directions
given
to
sentencing
judges
in
dorszynski
with
the
knowledge
that
the
entire
system
therein
simply
does
not
exist.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
agree,
justice
rehnquist,
that
that
is
a
complete
irony,
and
that
when
people
come
before
the
courts,
they
do
not
want
to
be
sentenced
under
the
youth
corrections
act,
because
the
youth
corrections
act
is
not
a
picnic.
it
gives
them
a
longer
sentence
than
they
might
normally
get,
and
it
gives
them
in
many
ways
different
types
of
treatment.
this
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
picnic.
the
borstal
system
was
hard
work.
now,
they
want
to
take...
what
the
government,
though,
has
done,
justice
rehnquist,
is
try
to
put
mr.
robinson
in
a
penal
never-never
land.
bear
in
mind
that
one
year
after
his
ten-year
yca
sentence
he
got
a
consecutive
adult
sentence.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
for
assaulting
a
prison
guard.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
the
sentence
doesn't
seem
unreasonable.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes,
except
for
the--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--except
for
the
possibility--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
except...
no,
that
isn't
correct,
because
there
are
cases
like
that,
mickless,
for
example,
mickless
versus
united
states,
because
they
could
then
parole
him
the
next
day
from
the
adult
sentence,
and
since
he
would
still
be
subject
to
being
called
back
for
a
parole
violation,
i
think
the
court
would
have
the
right
to
render
a
decision
as
to
the
conditions
of
confinement.
but
meanwhile,
justice
marshall,
they
haven't
paroled
him,
and
he
is
still
there,
and
he
is
still
in
the
wrong
place,
and
they
are
still
not
giving
him
treatment.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
understands
my
position.
i
am
not
quarreling
with
the
legality
of
the
second...
of
the
first
consecutive
sentence.
the
irony
is
that
the
second
consecutive
sentence
is
an
illegal
sentence,
as
this
court
determined
in
dorszynski,
because
there
was
no
no
benefit
finding.
the
government's
position
would
result
in
strange
anomalies.
take,
for
example,
a
misdemeanor
who
could
only
get
a
six-month
sentence.
he
gets
an
indeterminate
yca
sentence.
that
means
he
is
there
for
a
potential
four
to
six
years.
he
then
gets
in
trouble,
and
he
gets
a
one-year
consecutive
adult
sentence.
that
means
he
is
going
to
end
up
serving
five
to
seven
years
for
an
offense
that
if
he
were
sentenced
as
an
adult
he
could
only
be
imprisoned
six
months,
and
that
would
be
an
anomalous
result.
under
the
congressional
scheme,
it
doesn't
matter
what
pattern
of
sentences
occur.
if
a
youth
at
the
age
of
18
commits
a
robbery
and
gets
a
one-year
adult
sentence,
then
gets
in
trouble
again
before
the
age
of
22,
he
can
get
a
yca
sentence.
this
court
has
mandated
that
a
judge
make
a
no
benefit
finding.
but
the
question
of
what
the
bureau
of
prisons
could
do,
whether
they
could
yank
a
man
in
and
out
of
his
status
as
a
yca
offender,
mr.
strauss
referred
to
the
borstal
system.
well,
the
borstal
system
was
plainly
explained
to
congress,
including
the
power
to
take
a
person
from
a
youth
facility
and
put
him
in
a
penal
institution.
congress
did
not
adopt
that
suggestion.
they
explicitly
left
it
out.
when
the
initial
act
was
proposed
in
1943,
the
american
law
institute
proposed
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
be
given
the
authority
to
determine
yca
status.
all
the
judges
in
america
screamed
about
that.
that
was
rejected.
then
they
proposed
that
the
judges
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
share
these
powers.
and
what
you
had
was
a
system
in
which
only
the
trial
court
could
impose
a
yca
sentence.
now,
bear
in
mind,
in
dorszynski,
this
court
held
that
that
determination
of
the
trial
judge
is
not
reviewable
by
this
court.
now,
what
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
saying
is
that
either
they
can
countermand
the
judgment
of
the
initial
trial
judge
or
that
the
second
trial
judge
could
do
that.
now,
if
this
court
could
not
review
a
yca
sentence,
then
certainly
the
bureau
of
prisons
could
not
do
it,
nor
could
the
second
trial
judge,
nor
did
the
second
trial
judge
in
this
case
intend
or
pretend
to
countermand
the
youth
corrections
sentence.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
a
good
question.
i
am
not
surprised
you
asked.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
that
is
because
it
is
probably
one
of
the
most
difficult
questions
in
the
case,
and
we
have
agonized
over
what
the
correct
answer
is,
and
correct
not
in
the
manner
of
espousing
our
position
but
intellectually
and
legally
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
exactly.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
bureau
can
have
no
discretion,
and
bear
in
mind
when
i
give
this
answer,
and
i
may
be
sailing
away
the
rights
of
some
poor
indigent
someplace--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--not
mine.
i
don't
represent
him.
we
believe
that
in
this
case
the
concurrent
sentence
would
take
precedence
over
the
youth
corrections
sentence,
because
otherwise
you
would
be
having
the
discretion
of
two
trial
judges
in
conflict.
when
the
trial
judge
gives
a
yca
and
the
second
judge
gives
a
consecutive
sentence,
there
is
no
tension
whatsoever.
the
first
judge
in
effect
is
deferring
to
the
discretion...
the
second
judge
defers
to
the
discretion
of
the
initial
judge.
but
when
you
have
a
concurrent--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--under
different
circumstances
for
a
different
time
and
a
different--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--justice
white,
i
don't
think
those
sentences
are
in
conflict,
because
his
no
benefit
finding
takes
effect
only
upon
the
expiration
of
the
youth
offender
sentence.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
that
is
the
clear--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--all
right,
but
that
is
the
clear
answer
under
the
congressional
act.
however,
as
to
the
concurrent
sentence,
now
you
have
two
courts
of
equal
jurisdiction,
and
the
second
court
says,
for
this
offense,
i
wish
to
impose
a
concurrent
adult
sentence
now,
i
might
point
out
the
bureau--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--no
benefit.
the
bureau
of
prisons,
according
to
their
statistics,
they
say
they
have
in
the
youth
corrections
facilities
175
persons
who
have
consecutive
and
concurrent
sentences
so
although
the
bureau
of
prisons...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
them
because
they
mix
adult
and
youth
offenders
up
all
together,
so
it
makes
no
difference,
but
they
treat
them
as
a
youth
offender.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
that
person
can
be
immediately
incarcerated
as
an
adult
offender,
because
the
second
judge
has
exercised
his
discretion
that
this
person
should
be
immediately
incarcerated
as
an
adult,
and
i
think
the
question
is
not
without
its
difficulty,
because
the
first
judge
made
a
determination
that
the
offender
would
benefit,
but
the
second
judge
says
no.
they
are
both
judges
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
first
judge
cannot
veto
the
power
of
the
second
judge;
as
in
this
case,
the
second
judge
could
not
countermand
the
sentence
of
the
first
judge.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
he
didn't,
justice
white.
that
is
exactly
correct.
the
government
quotes
in
its
brief
the
language
that
he
would
not
benefit
further,
but
they
omit
the
rest
of
it
in
which
he
says,
"and
i
decline
to
sentence
him
under
the
act.
"
which
is
exactly
what
he
was
required
to
do
under
dorszynski.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes,
i
wish
you
would,
justice
marshall.
you
have
been
giving
me
awful
hard
ones.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
he
would
go
back
before
the
sentencing
judge
and
that
sentencing
judge
under
dorszynski
would
exercise
his
discretion--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--no,
but
i
mean,
under
the
second--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
depending...
if
he
were
under
22,
the
trial
judge
is
mandated
by
law
and
by
this
court's
decision--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--to
make
a
no
benefit
finding.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
he
would
go
to
an
adult--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--the
difference
is,
justice
marshall--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that
the
first
judge
made
a
judicial
determination
that
mr.
robinson
would
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
youth
corrections
act
for
a
ten-year
period.
no
other
court--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
the
theory
of--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
then
i
assume
they
would
electrocute
him,
you
know,
fairly,
promptly,
but
the
theory
of
the
youth
corrections
act,
and
mr.--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
if
he
keeps
shooting
people,
either...
it
depends
upon
your
theory
of
penology.
i
might
veer
more
towards
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
that
case,
but--
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
even
lawyers
like
some
protection.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
think
that
is
a
situation
that
could
quite
frequently
happen,
and
i
think
that
the
judges
normally
in
those
situations
will
determine
whether
under
the
second
offense
the
judge
is
going
to
sentence
him
as
an
adult,
and
whether--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--is
as
an
adult?
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
normally,
the
trial
court
judges
exercise
good
sense,
so
if
he
has
a
second
judge
who
has
given
this
gentleman,
let's
say,
ten
years,
and
as
as
an
adult,
he
would
not
reinstitute
the
youth
act
sentence.
if
he
did,
then
he
would
have
to
determine
which
really
was
in
progress,
and
i
guess
the
answer
might
be
that
he
might
have
to
serve
his
youth
corrections
act
sentence,
but
of
course,
in
this
case,
mr.
robinson--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--what
congress
had
in
mind,
it
is
very
clear
that
if
someone
had
the
time,
as
i
had,
to
read
the
act
and
the
legislative
history
from
beginning
to
end,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
big
surge
of
youth
coming
back
from
the
war,
because
this
act
started
being
considered
in
the
early
forties,
and
because
it
got
tied
up
with
an
adult
indeterminate
sentence
that
the
trial
judges
didn't
like,
it
got
kicked
off
to
1949,
and
they
said
that
the
percentage
of
crime
committed
by
youth
far
exceeded
their
percentage
of
the
total
population,
so
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
stop
hard
core
criminals,
and
we
are
penalizing
mr.
robinson
in
a
way.
we
are
saying
he
is
a
hardened
criminal,
and
a
failure
of
the
system,
when
the
system
really
didn't
exist.
now,
when
he
finally
gets
to
butner
a
year
ago,
and
they
finally
give
him
the
treatment
that
judge
moultry
said
in
1974
that
he
should
get,
which
was
intensive
individual
therapy,
he
has
reacted
wonderfully.
he
has
completed
courses
in
real
estate,
basic
math.
he
is
a
member
of
the
band.
he
does
his
job.
he
interacts
positively.
that
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
they
wanted
to
take
the
youth
of
america
and
save
them
from
being
repeater
criminals.
this
wasn't,
as
they
said,
a
molly-coddling
feel
sorry
for
the
underprivileged.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
exactly,
justice
white.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
we,
unfortunately,
of
course,
were
not
appointed
until
we
got
to
the
seventh--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes,
no
question,
justice
white,
that
if
he
wanted
to
terminate
a
youth
corrections
act
sentence,
the
second
judge
would
enter
a
concurrent
sentence.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
none
whatsoever,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
poor
mr.
robinson,
as
i
say,
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
his
ten-year
yca
sentence,
he
gets
this
adult
sentence.
the
bureau
of
prisons
says,
it
is
all
over,
mr.
robinson.
no
more
youth
corrections
treatment,
which
you
never
got
in
the
first
place,
but
you
are
not
going
to
get
it.
and
you
are
going
to...
they
concede
his
yca
sentence
is
going,
so
therefore
you
will
serve
your
full
eight
years
before
you
get
your
conditional
discharge,
but
as
for
your
adult
sentence,
you
get
no
credit
whatsoever,
and
that
is
why
the
government
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
so
nervous
about
this
case,
because
really
you
cannot
say
that
it
makes
penological
sense
to
keep
mr.
robinson
incarcerated
for
eight
years
under
the
youth
corrections
act
and
not
give
him
the
treatment
that
congress
mandated,
and
at
the
same
time
house
him
in
marion
as
an
adult
offender
with
the
hardest
of
criminals
in
the
nation,
and
say,
you
don't
get
your
good
time
credits,
you
don't
get
your
time
off,
nothing.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
not
retroactively.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
he
won't
start
receiving
them
until
january
of
1982.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think
the
trial
judges
are
aware
of
that.
what
they
are
not
aware
of,
justice
white,
is
that
the
judge
found
in
watts
versus
hadden
that
the
youth
corrections
act
is
a
myth,
and
that
this
system
does
not
exist,
because
if
you
ask
the
trial
court
judges
what
is
going
to
happen
to
their
youth
offenders
when
they
are
sent
to
the
facility,
they
think
they
will
be
segregated
from
adult
offenders,
they
think
that
they
will
receive
rehabilitative
treatment.
they
don't
think
they
are
going
to
be
mixed
with
adult
offenders
who
are
going
to
enforce
peace
and
quiet,
because
that
isn't
the
intention
of
the
judges.
and
i
am
surprised
that
the
bureau
of
prisons,
with
the
state
of
litigation
that
is
going
on,
in
brown
versus
carlson,
watts
versus
hadden,
johnson
versus
bell,
where
they
are
being
told
continuously
to
bring
your
performance
within
the
congressional
mandate...
i
mean,
it
is
32
years
later...
that
they
would
have
the
temerity
to
bring
this
case
before
the
court
and
say,
defer
to
our
expertise,
and
it
would
be
impractical
to
operate
the
act
as
congress
has
mandated,
when
they
have
never
tried.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no,
but
dorszynzki--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--mandates
segregation,
rehabilitation.
it
is
all
set
out
in
this
court's
opinion.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
but
poor
mr.
robinson
is
someone--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--justice
marshall,
his
first
offense
could
not
have
been
more
adult.
it
was
a
murder
committed
in
the
course
of
a
robbery.
i
don't
think
that
any
human
being
should
be
written
off.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
all
right.
well,
let
us
say--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--let
us
say
that
it
is
my
position
that
congress
has
mandated,
whatever
adjective
we
ascribe
to
mr.
robinson,
that
he
was
to
receive
certain
treatment,
and
that
was
rehabilitation
and
correction
so
that
he
would
not
be
a
threat
to
society.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes,
it
comes
under
the
act
of
congress.
we
feel
that
if
the
government
does
not
like
the
way
this
act
operates,
if
they
want
to
run
the
youth
corrections
act
the
way
they
want
to
run
it
as
against
the
way
congress
said
it
should
be
run,
if
they
think
that
it
is
proper
to
mix
adult
offenders
with
youthful
offenders,
then
we
believe
that
that
question
should
be
put
before
congress,
and
it
should
not
be
put
before
this
court,
as
this
court
stated
in
dorszynski.
if
the
court
should
hold
that
this
second
sentence
somehow
revoked
mr.
robinson's
youth
offender
status,
then,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
you
have
serious
constitutional
issues
of
equal
protection,
double
jeopardy,
and
due
process.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
act
has
to
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
which
raises
those
issues.
we
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
clearly
correct
that
the
third
circuit,
which
had
issued
these
wonderful
decisions
in
this
area
up
to
thompson
versus
carlson,
was
incorrect
in
its
ultimate
premise.
in
thompson
versus
carlson,
the
third
circuit
clearly
said
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
you
cannot
unilaterally
revoke
this
man's
status.
you
do
not
have
it
within
your
power.
as
much
as
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
like
to
have
that
power,
they
do
not
have
it.
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
that,
other
than
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
outing.
that
is
the
only
decision,
and
an
early
decision
in
abernathy,
which
i
do
not
think
adequately
addressed
the
issues,
but
all
the
other
courts
have
said,
including
thompson
versus
carlson,
you
do
not
have
that
power.
thompson
versus
carlson
said,
though,
that
the
second
judge
in
imposing
the
sentence
terminated
the
first
youth
corrections
sentence,
and
we
believe
the
seventh
circuit
was
clearly
correct
in
holding
that
that
was
not
the
effect
of
the
second
sentence.
indeed,
the
consecutive
adult
sentence
may
have
been
imposed
in
mr.
robinson's
case,
as
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
out,
precisely
because
he
was
serving
then
a
youth
corrections
sentence,
and
the
court
might
have
imposed
a
youth
corrections
sentence
otherwise.
thank
you.
