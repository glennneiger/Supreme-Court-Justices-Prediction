justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
respondent
were
sentenced
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
to
a
youth
sentence.
he
committed
additional
crimes
while
serving
that
sentence
and
received
consecutive
adult
terms
of
imprisonment.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
despite
the
adult
terms
he
must
yet
received
youth
treatment
under
the
act
for
the
remainder
of
his
youth
sentence.
we
granted
the
government's
petition
with
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
on
this
issue.
the
government
argues
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
authority
to
determine
that
respondent
will
not
benefit
from
future
youth
treatment.
respondent
argues
that
he
must
be
treated
as
a
youth
until
his
youth
sentence
expires,
even
though
he
will
then
have
to
serve
adult
terms
of
imprisonment.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reject
both
arguments.
we
hold
that
the
act
does
not
require
continued
youth
treatment
if
the
judge
imposing
the
subsequent
adult
sentence
determines
that
the
defendant
will
not
benefit
when
further
youth
treatment
during
the
remainder
of
his
youth
sentence.
we
also
conclude
that
the
judge
who
imposed
the
first
adult
term
in
this
particular
case
made
such
a
determination.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined.
