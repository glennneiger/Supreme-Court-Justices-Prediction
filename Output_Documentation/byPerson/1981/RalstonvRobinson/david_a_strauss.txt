mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
prisoner
serving
a
sentence
under
the
youth
corrections
act,
who
commits
a
crime
and
is
sentenced
to
a
consecutive
term
of
imprisonment
as
an
adult,
must
continue
to
be
treated
as
a
youth
corrections
act
offender
for
the
remainder
of
his
youth
corrections
act
term.
in
1974,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
robinson,
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
maximum
punishment
for
that
offense
is
life
imprisonment.
the
respondent
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
or
yca.
the
yca
permits
a
judge
as
an
alternative
to
imposing
an
adult
sentence
to
commit
an
offender
under
the
age
of
22
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
for
a
program
of
treatment
designed
to
correct
his
antisocial
tendencies
and
restore
him
to
a
normal,
productive,
and
law-abiding
life.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
congress
intended
it
for
that
reason.
congress
intended
also
that
the
yca
be
modeled
on
the
english
borstal
system,
and
provided
as
one
aspect
of
yca
treatment
that
yca
offenders
be
segregated
insofar
as
practical
from
other
classes
of
offenders.
in
1975,
while
he
was
serving
his
yca
sentence,
the
respondent
was
convicted
of
assaulting
a
federal
correctional
officer
with
a
deadly
weapon.
the
judge
before
whom
he
was
convicted
expressly
declined
to
sentence
him
under
the
yca,
found
that
the
respondent
would
not
benefit
further
from
yca
treatment,
and
sentenced
him
as
an
adult
to
a
five
and
a
half
year
term
of
imprisonment.
the
judge
specified
that
this
sentence
was
to
run
consecutively
to
the
yca
term,
and
recommended
that
the
respondent
be
moved
from
the
youth
facility
where
he
had
been
being
confined
to
a
more
secure
institution.
two
years
later,
in
1977,
the
respondent
was
again
convicted
of
assaulting
a
federal
prison
guard,
and
although
he
was
not
yet
22,
he
was
again
sentenced
to
an
adult
term
of
imprisonment.
this
time
the
sentence
was
one
year
and
a
day.
the
judge
specified
that
this
sentence
was
to
run
consecutively
to
his
other
two
sentences.
when
the
respondent
received
his
adult
sentences,
he
acquired
a
dual
status;
although
he
was
still
serving
a
yca
term,
he
was
also
under
an
adult
sentence.
at
this
point,
the
bureau
of
prisons,
following
an
established
policy
for
dealing
with
dual
status
offenders,
began
treating
the
respondent
in
prison
as
an
adult
offender.
the
effect
of
this
was
that
the
respondent
was
given
access
to
those
treatment
programs
designed
for
adults
as
opposed
to
those
programs
designed
for
youthful
offenders.
in
doing
this,
the
bureau
was
exercising
a
power
that
is
possessed
by
correctional
authorities
under
the
borstal
system,
the
english
borstal
system,
which
as
i
said
was
the
model
for
the
yca.
in
that
system,
the
authorities
could
transfer
an
offender
from
a
youth
institution
to
an
adult
prison
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
they
could
do
it.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
not
a
necessary
part
of
our
argument
here,
because
he
has
been
convicted
twice.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
our
view
is
that
the
bureau
should
have
considerably
more
latitude
in
doing
that
than--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
bureau
does
have
the
power
to...
given
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
the
bureau
should
have
the
power
to
place
him
in
an
adult
institution.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
our
position,
but
we
do
have
the
second
conviction
in
this
case.
in
1978,
the
respondent
brought
this
action
to
challenge
the
bureau's
policy
by
filing
a
pro
se
document
in
the
united
states
district
court,
in
which
he
sought
to
be
segregated
from
adult
offenders,
and
to
be
treated
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
yca.
the
district
court
ordered
relief,
ordering
that
respondent
be
moved
to
an
institution
where
he
would
be
segregated
and
would
receive
yca
treatment.
at
the
time
the
district
court
granted
relief,
the
respondent,
because
of
his
two
adult
convictions,
and
because
he
had
compiled
an
extensive
disciplinary
record
in
prison,
including
several
violent
incidents,
was
in
the
control
unit
of
the
united
states
penetentiary
at
marion,
illinois.
that
is
the
most
secure
unit
of
the
most
secure
facility
in
the
federal
prison
system.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
justice
marshall.
as
of
january,
he
begins
his
first
adult
sentence.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
order,
and
on
our
petition
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
respondent
relies
on
the
provisions
of
the
yca,
which
prescribe
segregation
and
treatment
for
yca
offenders.
the
segregation
requirement,
as
respondent
virtually
concedes,
and
as,
in
any
event,
this
court
has
said
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt,
was
intended
to
allow
the
bureau
to
insulate
yca
offenders
from
the
corrupting
influence
of
more
hardened,
experienced
adult
offenders.
the
respondent
is
precisely
the
sort
of
offender
from
whom
yca
offenders
are
supposed
to
be
segregated.
he
is
under
two
adult
sentences.
he
has
been
in
prison
since
he
was
17,
and
his
terms
will
not
expire
until
he
is
31.
he
has
committed
three
violent
felonies,
and
he
has
an
extensive
disciplinary
record.
this
is
just
the
sort
of
offender
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
decided
that
yca
offenders
should,
insofar
as
practical--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
in
fact,
it
seems
reasonably
clear
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
this
situation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
language--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--it
is
essentially
unenlightening.
we
do
not
suggest
that
it
supports
our
position
directly.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
when
the
language
of
the
statute
is
essentially
not
addressed
to
this
problem,
and
leaves
us
where
we
started,
then
we
have
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
are
different
levels
of
security
for
different
types
of
yca
offenders
and
types
of
adult
offenders.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
are
several
problems.
one
problem
is
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--this
is
not
by
the
statute.
this
is
by
bureau
of
prisons
policy.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
the
statute
authorizes
it,
but
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
established
it.
one
problem,
justice
marshall,
to
answer
your
question,
is
that
in
several
lower
court
decisions
constraints
have
been
put
on
the
bureau's
power
to
place
troublesome
yca
offenders
in
maximum
security
institutions,
and
given
those
constraints,
they
have
to
place
this
sort
of
offender,
for
whom
the
act
is
so
clearly
not
designed,
in
a
yca
institution--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
are
no
maximum
security
yca
institutions.
there
are
yca
offenders
in
maximum
security
custody.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
are
yca
offenders
in
separate
units.
actually,
this
is
a
difficult
matter
to
talk
about,
because
the
policy
is
in
flux.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
are...
the
yca
units
consist
only
of
offenders
at
a
single
level
of
security
in
any
institution.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
are
yca
units
within
institutions,
and
the
institution
is
at
a
security
level.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
yes.
we
regret
the
practical
problem.
we
agree
the
proper
disposition
would
be
a
munsingwear
order
should
the
court--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
will
only
affect
a
couple
of
months
of
his
custody,
but
of
course,
that
is
enough
to
save
it
from
mootness,
and
as
we
explained
when
we
asked
the
court
to
expedite
consideration
of
this
case,
it
is
a
pressing
issue
for
several
other
reasons.
there
is
a
severe
conflict
in
the
circuits.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
at
this
time,
there
is
not.
there
is
a
plan
in
the
works
for
establishing
two
and
possibly
three
institutions
consisting
exclusively
of
yca
offenders.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
it
does
not.
it
depends
on
the
outcome
of
separate
litigation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no
doubt,
the
budget.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
under
a
different
provision
of
the
act
from
the
one
under
which
the
respondent
here
is
sentenced.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
the
theory
that
some
courts
have
used.
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
seems
to
be
right,
justice
o'connor.
the
quick
answer
to
that
concern
is
that
mr.
robinson,
the
respondent
here,
was
not
sentenced
to
a
longer
term
than
an
adult
could
have
received.
an
adult
could
have
received
life
imprisonment.
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years.
so,
whatever
those
concerns
are,
they
are
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
would,
of
course,
depend
on
the
contours
of
the
holding.
as
for
the
other
cases,
i
would
point
out
that
the
argument
is
by
no
means
decisive,
because
what
offenders
in
yca
custody
are
entitled
to
is
what
congress
gave
them,
and
if
we
can
establish
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
this
program
would
survive
beyond
the
point
where
is
served
any
purpose,
then
it
can't
be
said
that
they
are
being
denied
or
deprived
of
something
that
congress
intended
them
to
have.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
if
the
second
judge...
you
mean
the
judge
who
sentenced
him
to
his
first
adult
sentence?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
he
had
imposed
a
concurrent
sentence,
i
would
think
there
would
be
no
question.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
could.
of
course,
that
actually
points
out
a
paradox
in
the
situation,
that
an
offender
whose
crime
was
not
sufficiently
serious--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
also,
he
wouldn't
get
the
benefit--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
he
wants
to
impose
a
consecutive
sentence
essentially,
the
adult
sentence
to
go
on
top
of
it.
the
paradox
is
that
consecutive
sentences
ordinarily
denote
a
more
serious
offense,
and
the
lower
court's
decision--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
judge
decided
the
additional
time
was
necessary,
and
that
makes
it
necessary
also
to
change
the
character
of
the
first
sentence.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right.
it
is
not
necessary.
it
is
not
something
we
are
required
to
do.
in
our
view,
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
congress'
intention
in
enacting
the
statute.
the
other
point
about
the
segregation
requirement
is
that,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
and
as
justice
blackmun,
in
three
months'
time,
the
respondent
will
begin
his
adult
sentence,
and
at
that
time
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
he
will
be
an
adult
offender,
and
no
one
would
contend
that
at
that
time
he
can
claim
a
right
to
be
segregated
from
adults
or
placed
as
a
yca
offender,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
thinking
that
he
is
somehow
less
of
a
corrupting
influence
now
than
he
will
be
three
months
from
now,
or
that
he
is
more
fit
to
be
placed
with
yca
offenders
now
than
he
will
be
in
three
months.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right,
but
i
think
the
same
point
still
holds,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
believing
that
at
the
earlier
point,
after
he
has
committed
a
crime
and
sentenced
as
an
adult,
that
somehow
he
will
not
become
a
corrupting
influence
until
that
sentence
begins
to
run.
the
other
provision
of
the
yca
on
which
the
respondent
relies
is
the
treatment
provision,
and
again,
the
courts
below
have
applied
this
provision
to
the
kind
of
offenders
for
whom
congress
did
not
intend
it.
yca
treatment
in
congress'
view
was
designed,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested
in
an
earlier
question,
to
return
offenders
to
productive
lives
in
the
community,
and
to
that
end
an
integral
part
of
the
treatment
congress
envisioned
was
a
gradual
phased,
supervised
reintegration
of
an
offender
into
society.
at
the
end
of
his
yca
term
however,
the
respondent,
of
course,
will
not
be
returned
to
a
productive
life
in
society.
instead,
he
will
begin
two
adult
prison
terms,
and
for
that
same
reason
it
will
be
impossible
gradually
to
reintegrate
him
into
society.
so,
an
integral
part
of
yca
treatment
as
congress
saw
it
will
not
be
capable
of
being
afforded
to
this
respondent.
nothing
in
the
act
suggests
that
yca
treatment
is
preparation
for
a
life
in
prison,
and
nothing
in
the
act
suggests
that
the
custodial
phase
of
yca
treatment
followed
by
an
adult
prison
term
will
do
anyone
any
good,
society
or
the
offender.
it
is
at
least
plausible
that
a
custodial
treatment
program
designed
to
culminate
in
an
offender's
return
to
society
when
followed
not
by
a
return
to
society
but
by
an
adult
prison
sentence
will
do
even
the
offender
more
harm
than
good.
so,
if
anything,
it
thwarts
congress'
intention
to
attempt
to
provide
respondent
with
yca
treatment.
certainly,
there
is
no
basis
in
the
yca
for
requiring
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
provide
treatment
to
an
offender
such
as
this.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
the
judge
had
imposed
yca
sentences,
he
would
be
a
yca
offender.
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
would
still
be
a
yca
offender.
there
would
be
no
basis
for
claiming
he
is
an
adult
offender.
i
would
point
out
that,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
earlier,
if
his
prison
record
were
very
bad,
it
might
be
necessary
to
take
some
steps
that
would
require
confining
him
in
conditions
comparable
to
those
of
an
adult
offender,
but
the
bureau
would
still
regard
him
as
a
yca
offender.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
to
decide
whether
someone
is
a
yca
offender
or
an
adult
offender.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right,
although
the
treatment
conditions
have
to
be
in
the
control
of
the
bureau,
and
the
confinement
conditions
more
generally.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
may
be
sufficient
if
we
could
do
that.
one
problem
with
that
is
that
constraints
have
been
put
on
the
bureau
by
the
lower
courts.
the
other
problem--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
case
is
about
the
validity
of
the
existing
policy.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
obstacles
that
have
been
put
in
the
way
of
implementation
of
that
policy
give
this
case
its
practical
importance.
our
view
is
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute
remains,
that
congress
did
not
intend
yca
treatment
for
someone
who
is
going
off
to
an
adult--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
may
be
some
circumstances,
in
our
view,
under
which
a
yca
offender
is
such
a
problem,
the
only
practical
way
to
deal
with
him
is
to
place
him
in
an
adult
penitentiary.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
the
bureau's
present
policy,
and
it
is
one
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
its
validity
is
not
necessarily
involved
in
this
case,
because
he
would--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
the
bureau
has
complete
discretion
to
place
an
unruly
offender
in
adult
conditions
whether
or
not
he
has
a
yca...
has
an
adult
sentence,
then
a--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
one-year
adult
sentence,
in
our
view,
would
make
him
an
adult
offender,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
policy
of
treating
yca
offenders
with
adult
convictions
as--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
assume.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
policy
of
treating
a
straight
yca--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right,
essentially.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
would
be
a
difficult
question.
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
affirmance.
it
would
be
difficult--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
this
offender
has
two
adult
sentences
for
serious
crimes
in
prison.
it
is
hard
to
see
how
someone
could
be
more
unruly
than
that.
so
to
that
extent
it
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
again--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--simply,
if
you
simply
entered
an
order
of
affirmance,
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
carry
out
the
other
policy,
but
as
i
said,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
this
offender
can
be...
can
assert
a
right
to
continue
the
yca
treatment
unless
any
unruly
yca
offender
could.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
in
our
view,
that
is
not
what
the
act
says
or
intends.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
bureau's
policy
that
we
have
been
talking
about
of
placing
unruly
yca
offenders
in
adult
conditions
applies
only
to
segregation.
the
yca
forms
of
treatment,
the
characteristic
forms
of
education
and
counseling
made
available
to
youths
would
still
be
available
to
them.
essentially
the
problem
is
that
he
would
have
to
be
put
in
some
place
like
the
control
unit
at
marion,
where
he
is
under
very
close
supervision
all
the
time,
and
as
a
practical
matter
in
those
conditions
we
cannot
talk
of
segregation
from
adult
offenders.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
would
suspect
they
have.
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
cases,
but
i
would
suspect
it
has
been
done.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
it
is
common,
and
in
fact
my
understanding
is
that
at
the
federal
psychiatric
prison
institution
at
butner,
there
are
yca
offenders.
that
is
a
mixed
institution
specializing
in
psychiatric
treatment.
the
respondent
also
happens
to
be
there,
but
he
is
there
as
an
adult.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
it
specializes
in
psychiatric
treatment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
you
can't
send
them
to
marion--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
one
or
two
points.
justice
white,
the
reason
that
the
judge's
sentencing
an
offender
to
a
concurrent
adult
sentence
doesn't
solve
the
problem
is,
of
course,
the
judge
might
think,
as
he
evidently
did
in
this
case,
that
the
offense
was
sufficiently
serious
that
the
additional
punishment
of
a
consecutive
sentence
was
necessary.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
judge
in
this
case
didn't
take
any
convincing.
he
thought
a
consecutive
sentence...
well,
we
don't
know
if
he
took
convincing
or
not,
but
in
any
event
he
thought
a
consecutive
sentence
was
necessary.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
judge
could--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
of
course,
that
would
prohibit
the
judge
from
sentencing
a
consecutive
sentence,
a
consecutive
maximum
sentence
under
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we
think
the
judge
puts
on
a
consecutive
sentence,
that
it
would
be
grossly--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--it
should
permit
the
bureau
not
to
have
to
treat
him
as
a
yca
offender
anymore,
now
that
yca
treatment
is
inappropriate
for
him.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
said
that
the
offender
will
not
benefit
any
further
under
the
provisions
of
the
yca,
and
sentenced
him
to
an
adult
term,
and
also
recommended
that
the
offender
be
transferred
from
the
federal
youth
center
where
he
had
been
confined
to
a
more
secure
institution.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
paraphrased
at
page
6
of
our,
brief.
it
is
also
in
the
judgment
and
commitment
order
which
we
have
lodged
with
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
don't
rely
on
the
judge's
statements.
what
we
rely
on
is
the
fact
that
an
adult
sentence
was
imposed,
and
under
the
act
it
now
makes
no
sense
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--as
a
yca
offender.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
think
even
if
the
judge
hadn't
made
the
statements
that
it
would
make
no
sense
to
take
an
offender
who
is
an
adult
offender
in
the
contemplation
of
the
yca
and
continue
to
treat
him
as
if
he
were
a
yca
offender.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
it
is
not...
to
treat
him
as
an
adult
offender.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
do
want
the
bureau
to
be
able
to
say
in
cases
like
this,
we
are
going
to
treat
this
person
as
an
adult.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that
is
a
misconception
that
the
respondent
has
been
repeating.
this
isn't
a
matter
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
revoking
or
overruling
or
countermanding
a
sentence.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
sentence.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
after
the
second
adult--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
right,
because
the
question
is,
what
does
the
youth
corrections
act--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
authority
is
already
implicit
in
the
youth
corrections
act
sentence.
it
is
sour
view
that
congress
never
intended
a
youth
corrections
act
sentence
to
be
so
inalienable
that
even--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
first
sentencing
judge
may
very
well
have
known
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
just
don't
know
what
the
first
sentencing
judge
thought.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
not
overruling
a
federal
district
judge.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
is
not
even
changing
it.
the
federal
district
judge
gave
him
a
yca
sentence.
our
problem
is,
what
does
that
entail?
specifically,
does
it
entail
continuing
to
treat
him
as
a
yca
offender
when
it
makes
no
sense,
and
our
view
is,
it
does
not
entail
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
think
the
second
sentencing
judge's
decision
was
what
made
it
no
longer
appropriate
to
treat
him
as
a
yca
offender.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
his
decision
to
sentence
him
as
an
adult.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
did
i
abandon
what,
justice
marshall?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
are
relying
on
the
adult
sentence,
not
on
the
judge's
statements
that
went
with
the
sentence.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
an
adult
sentence,
found
that
he
would
not
benefit
from
yca
treatment.
that
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
judge
made
a
statement
that
the
offender
would--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we
rely
on
his
sentence,
on
the
imposition
of
the
adult
sentence.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
in
order
to
impose
that
sentence,
he
had
to
make
a
certain
finding.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
rely
on
the
sentence
which
includes
the
finding,
but
it
is
the
sentence
we
rely
on,
not
his
extra
statements.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
1975.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
he
made
a
no
benefit
finding
explicitly.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
1977,
there
is
no--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
is
none
in
the
judgment
and
commitment
order,
but
the
respondent
concedes
he
is
no
raising
that
here,
so
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
valid
adult
sentence.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
ten
years.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
not
quite,
i
suppose
because
he
had
more
than
four
and
a
half
years
left
on
his
yca
sentence
at
that
point.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
pretty
close
to
solving
it.
of
course,
that
would
have
required
the
judge
to
jiggle
around
his
sentences
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
problem.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
ten
years--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
the
bureau
thought
that
his
yca
sentence
plus
the
consecutive
sentence--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--thank
you.
