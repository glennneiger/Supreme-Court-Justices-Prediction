unknown
speaker
not
to
fit
in
with
a
group
of
hardened
criminals.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
just
on
that
analogy,
in
the
borstal
system
they
could
do
that
even
without
a
second
conviction,
couldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
could
do
that
under
the
yca
if
this
man
had
just
been
a
very
unruly
inmate,
and
caused
a
lot
of
trouble,
but
never
actually
was
convicted
of
a
second
felony?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
view
on
that
question?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
your
view
on
the
question
i
asked
you?
does
the
bureau
have
the
power
to
do
that
without
a
second
conviction?
unknown
speaker
you
really
don't
need
to
rely
on
the
second
conviction
then
to
sustain
your
position.
unknown
speaker
and
as
of
january,
this
all
will
be
moot.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather,
mr.
strauss,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
ever
contemplated
this
situation,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
might
appear
that
he
is
entitled
to
yca
treatment.
unknown
speaker
on
the
face
of
the
statute
it
seems
that
way,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
rather
explicit,
it
seems
to
me.
but
in
any
event,
in
any
event,
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
we
can
forget
what
the
statute
says,
and
just
in
contemplation
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
chap
who
is
supposed
to
get
yca
treatment.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
it
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
statute
as
explicitly
declared
by
congress,
if
they
were
to
put
him
with
other
young
youth
offenders.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
federal
institutions
for
hardened
yca
people
and
unhardened
ones.
there
is
only
one
level.
unknown
speaker
there
are?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
you
put
this
guy
in
that
one?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
only
had
one.
well,
excuse
me.
there
are
different
levels.
is
this
by
regulation
or
is
this
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
by
regulation.
unknown
speaker
like
a
maximum
security
yca
institution.
unknown
speaker
where
are
they?
in
the
regular
institutions?
unknown
speaker
so
in
the
yca
institutions
you
don't
have
any
separation.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
are
not
addressing
my
question.
in
the
same
yca
institution,
do
you
or
do
you
not
have
two
levels
of
security,
in
the
same
yca
institution?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
the
man
involved
here,
if
put
in
a
yca
institution
by
a
court,
would
be
right
beside
the
guy
that
was
doing
just
fine.
he
might
very
well.
that's
right.
we
have
something
of
a
practical
problem
with
this
case,
too,
don't
we,
because
if
the
case
is
argued
now
and
the
opinion
doesn't
come
down
before
he
begins
serving
his
adult
sentence,
there
will
be
an
issue
of
mootness
which
we
have
traditionally
dealt
with
by
the
munsingwear
case.
unknown
speaker
so
whatever
this
court
does,
it
isn't
going
to
have
much
effect
on
this
particular
respondent.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure,
because
i
think...
i
want
to
be
sure
about
your
colloquy
with
justice
marshall.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
yca
institution
as
such.
unknown
speaker
does
that
depend
on
the
outcome
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
the
budget.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
under
the
youth
corrections
act,
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
the
youth
offender
will
serve
a
longer
period
of
time
in
custody
than
if
he
were
an
adult,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
that
is
possible,
right?
unknown
speaker
right,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
and
the
theory
of
upholding
that
kind
of
a
provision
was
that
the
youth
offender
would
be
getting
special
treatment,
so
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo,
in
effect,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
then,
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
can
transfer
someone
in
the
middle
of
a
youth
offender
sentence
to
an
adult
facility,
then
you
lose
that
quid
pro
quo,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
our
holding
here
cause
major
concerns
in
future
cases
if
that
happened
to
be
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
follow
up
with
that?
is
it
your
view
that
the
second
trial
judge
at
the
time
of
the
second
offense
could
have
imposed
a
concurrent
sentence
instead
of
a
consecutive
sentence,
which
would
then
have
authorized
the
bureau
to
treat
him
as
an
adult
rather
than
a
yca
offender?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
the
department
of
justice
pretty
much
take
care
of
the
problem
by
asking
for
concurrent
sentences
whenever
a
yca
offender
commits
another
felony?
unknown
speaker
it
can't
get
the
benefit
of
the
longer
yca
sentence
that
justice
o'connor
adverted
to
it
it
did
that,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
what
he
wants
to
do
is
get
the
benefit
of
the
length
of
the
yca
sentence
but
not
the
quid
pro
quo.
unknown
speaker
so
they
want
the
additional
time,
and
they
also
want
to
change
the
character
of
the
first
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
make
it
necessary.
under
the
department's
policy
it
is
desirable
to
change
the
character
of
the
first
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
any
decision
the
court
is
going
to
make
is
going
to
apply
to
someone
who
might
have
nine
years
left,
or
a
longer
period.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
answered
this,
but
there
would
be
no
question
if
either
one
of
these
two
judges
had
said
yca,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
and
there
would
be
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
it
is
up
to
the
judge,
not
to
the
department
of
justice.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
understand
why
it
isn't
sufficient
to
achieve
the
department's
end
to
just
leave
it
to
the
bureau
if
he
is
a
youth
offender
to
deal
with
him
as
an
adult,
or
confine
him
as
an
adult,
or
confine
him
like
they
would
an
adult,
if
he
gets
out
of
hand.
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
think
what
this
case
is
really
about
is
the
validity
of
the
existing
policy
of
the
bureau.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
whether
they
may
confine
a
youth
offender
as
an
adult
if
he
gets
out
of
hand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
are
you
suggesting
to
my
brother
white
that
without
a
second
conviction,
just
because
of
misbehavior,
the
policy
of
the
department
would
permit
their
treating
him
as
an
adult,
even
though
he
had
been
sentenced
as
a
youth
offender?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
bureau's
presently
published
policy,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
its
validity
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily.
it
is
not
involved.
you
put
in
another
word.
you
put
in
another
word,
not
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
were
to
do
that,
we
would
be
answering
a
question
that
this
case
doesn't
present.
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
you
take
a
person
23
years
old
off
the
street
and
try
him
for
a
crime
and
the
judge
sentences
him
to
20
years,
he
begins
serving
that
sentence
as
soon
as
the
trial
judge
directs,
or
as
soon
as
his
appeals
are
exhausted?
unknown
speaker
and
here,
of
course,
he
begins
serving
the
adult
sentence
after
the
yca
sentence
expires.
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
a
ten-year
yca
sentence,
as
there
was
here
in
1974,
and
say
in
the
first
trial,
the
first
offense
was
in
1975,
and
the
trial
judge
gave
him
one
year,
as
he
did
the
last
time,
it
is
your
view
that
that
one-year
adult
sentence
would
entitle
the
bureau
to
give
him
ten
years
of
adult
treatment,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
whole
ten-year
sentence
could
be
treated
as
an
adult
sentence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
would
the
government
regard
an
affirmance
here
as
invalidating
the
policy?
the
present
policy.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
present
policy
you
told
us,
without
regard
to
an
adult
conviction,
that
they
can
treat
him
as
an
adult
if
he
gets
too
far
out
of
hand.
i
thought
you
just
told
me
that.
that
is
the
policy.
unknown
speaker
a
yca
offender
may
be
treated
as
an
adult
if
he
gets
too
far
out
of
hand.
that
is
the
present
bureau
policy,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
affirm
here,
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would
invalidate
that
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
talking
about
an
affirmance.
unknown
speaker
that
is
true,
but
you
think
an
affirmance
here
would
prevent
the
bureau
under
its
present
policy
from
confining
him
as
an
adult?
unknown
speaker
if
we
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
the
argument
is,
that
is
what
the
act
says.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
if
you
know
the
policy,
or
if
you
know
the
background,
has
the
bureau
of
prisons
had
any
occasion
to
take
an
unruly
youth
offender
who
is
in
custody,
who
is
thought
to
be
subject
to
some
emotional
problems,
and
sent
him
off
to
a
federal
psychiatric
institution
for
analysis
and
treatment?
have
they
done
that,
do
you
know?
if
you
know?
unknown
speaker
that
is
common,
or
at
least
it
is
not
uncommon
with
respect
to
other
prisoners
in
other
federal
institutions,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
burner
is
a
very
special
institution.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
a
sense
for
what
would
amount
to
violations
of
parole,
the
equivalent
of
parole.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
proposition,
laying
aside
the
statute
for
just
a
moment,
that
this
man
is
now
demonstrably
on
this
record
precisely
the
kind
of
person
that
congress
said
should
not
be
mixed
in
with
youth
offenders?
unknown
speaker
what
do
these
two
convictions
mean?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
a
man
was
up
for
youth
correction,
yca
treatment,
and
the
record
showed
he
had
three
felony
convictions
for
violent
crimes.
do
you
think
he
would
be
a
good
subject?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
this
man.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
a
man
who
is
brought
before
a
court,
and
this
is
his
third
conviction
for
violent
felony.
do
you
think
the
court
would
be
obliged
to
give
him
yca
treatment?
unknown
speaker
to
the
contrary.
you
would
think
he
was
not,
wouldn't
you?
now,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
say
three
violent
felonies.
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
he
makes
the
finding.
which
finding
do
you
think
he
would
make?
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
am
going
to
ask
you
what
is
the
significance
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case,
you
are
not
attacking
the
action
of
the
judges
under
later
convictions.
unknown
speaker
they
sentenced
him
as
an
adult.
you
don't
complain
about
that.
unknown
speaker
all
you
complain
about...
and
the
judge
himself
didn't
attempt
to
terminate
his
prior
youth
condition.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
said,
because
he
has
been
convicted
as
an
adult,
we
will
terminate,
treat
him
as
an
adult.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
any
later
judge
is
bound
to
sentence
him
for
a
later
felony
as
a
youth
offender?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
longest
sentence
that
you
are
aware
of
under
the
youth
corrections
act?
unknown
speaker
how
many
sentences
over
ten
years
under
the
yca
are
made,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
but
percentagewise,
it
is
a
small
percentage
of
cases,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
like
sending
them
to
marion.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
has
the
bureau
ever
made
any
announcement
of
any
such
policy,
or
is
that
your
inference?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
the
only
incredible
irony
in
this
case,
is
it?
in
a
sense,
you
are
urging
that
your
client
be
continued
to
be
confined
under
the
sentence,
whereas
the
government
is
urging
that
he
be
released
from
that
sentence
and
start
serving
another
sentence.
unknown
speaker
for
doing
what?
unknown
speaker
does
that
seem
unreasonable
to
you?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
government
paroles
him
from
the
yca
act
today.
is
this
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
he
will
stay
right
where
he
is,
won't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
you
couldn't
say
a
mumbling
word.
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solovy,
on
your
initial
point,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
you.
unknown
speaker
you
contend
that
because
of
the
two-year
parole
at
the
end
of
his
eight-year
time
in
custody,
this
case
will
not
be
moot
next
january.
unknown
speaker
technically,
because
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
other
sentences
being
paroled--
unknown
speaker
--within
the
two-year
period.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
sentence
were
concurrent.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
to
get
to
it.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
later
conviction
automatically
terminates
the
youth
sentence,
wholly
aside
from
any
discretion
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
that
is
the
question
i
want
an
answer
to.
unknown
speaker
does
it
automatically
terminate
it
when
there
is
a
concurrent
sentence?
or
does
it
give
some
discretion
to
the
bureau
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
but
not
yours.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
sense
that
in
order
to
sentence
him
as
an
adult,
he
has
to
make
a
no
benefit
finding,
which
is
contrary
to
what
the
first
judge
found.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
he
nevertheless
says
at
this
very
moment
he
will
not
benefit
from
being
treated
as
a
youth,
and
yet
your
argument
is
that
he
must
be
treated
as
a
youth.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
go
ahead
on
your
concurrent
sentence--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
says
no
benefit.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
didn't
even
try
to.
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
an
easier
one.
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
man
had
been
acquitted
originally,
and
then
knifed
somebody.
where
would
he
go?
unknown
speaker
no,
he
was
acquitted.
unknown
speaker
he
was
acquitted--
unknown
speaker
--and
he
knifed
somebody.
unknown
speaker
he
would
go
to
an
adult
jail,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
found
that
he
was
entitled
to
adult
treatment,
where
would
he
go?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
difference
here
that
is
instead
of
being
acquitted,
he
was
convicted.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
how
many
crimes
he
committed?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
shot
18
people
in
six
days?
unknown
speaker
could
they
do
that
under
your
theory?
could
they
electrocute
him
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
would.
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen...
suppose
a
youth
corrections
act,
as
it
was
here,
was
pronounced,
sentence
was
pronounced,
and
then
the
judge
said,
however,
i
am
going
to
put
you
on
probation.
that
will
be
hanging
over
you.
and
then
he
goes
out
and
commits
a
murder
or
something
else.
do
you
think
the
youth
corrections
act
sentence
must
be
served
first
before
the
second
conviction,
sentence
must
be
served?
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
that
the
second
sentence
then
for
murder--
unknown
speaker
--is
as
an
adult.
is
the
youth
corrections
act
sentence
going
to
be
a
barrier?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
this
act?
unknown
speaker
but
any
time
a
judge,
when
he
finds
a
youth
offender
is
convicted
of
another
crime,
any
time
a
judge
goes
to
sentence,
if
he
thinks
the
status
of
the
youth
offender
should
be
terminated
and
he
should
start
serving
an
adult
sentence,
he
can
affect
that
by
just
sentencing
him
concurrently.
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
option
is
always
available
in
such
cases
like
this.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
if
the
government
asked
the
judge
to
do
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
government's
position
is
that
you
should
say
that
automatically
the
youth
offender
status
ends
with
the
second
conviction--
unknown
speaker
--and
wouldn't
want
to
leave
it
just
to
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
the
judge
could
control
it.
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
is
a
yca
defendant
entitled
to
the
good
time
credits
and
the
two-thirds
maximum?
unknown
speaker
so
those
are
strictly
for
adult
offenders?
unknown
speaker
but
as
soon
as
he
starts
serving
his
adult
sentence,
he
will
receive
those.
unknown
speaker
not
retroactively,
but--
unknown
speaker
--which
will
be
the
date
he
commences
his
adult
sentence.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
judges
across
the
country
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
concurrent
sentence
will
terminate
the
youth
offender
sentence?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
cases
you
have
referred
to
are
not
from
this
court,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
it
also
makes
the
finding
on
review.
unknown
speaker
you
still
keep
talking
about
poor
mr.
robinson,
and
all
he
did
was
stab
a
prison
guard.
unknown
speaker
poor
mr.
robinson
wants
youth
treatment.
isn't
that
rather
adult
action
to
stab
a
guard?
unknown
speaker
i
just
object
to
your
using
the
word
"poor".
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
don't
make
me
cry
about
it.
unknown
speaker
and
that
comes
under
the
act
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
you
would
rather
have
an
automatic
rule
than
have
to
convince
the
judge.
i
can
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
a
concurrent
sentence
automatically
terminates
a
youth
offender,
all
a
judge
has
to
say
is,
he
could
say,
ten
years
as
an
adult,
and
the
sentence
to
begin
immediately,
the
youth
offender
status
is
terminated.
unknown
speaker
that
is
equivalent
to
a
concurrent
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you.
but
in
this
case,
exactly
what
did
the
judge
say?
your
position
is
that
you
want
an
automatic
rule
to
prevent
the
judge
from
putting
on
a
consecutive
sentence.
unknown
speaker
that
the
sentence
should
start
right
now.
unknown
speaker
exactly
what
did
the
second
judge
say
with
respect,
if
anything,
to
no
benefit?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
just
practically
the
same
as
saying,
i
hereby
terminate
the--
unknown
speaker
--you
want
an
automatic
rule.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
why
you
don't
rely
on
the
judge's
statement?
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
the
authority
to
be
put
in
the
bureau
of
prisons--
unknown
speaker
--to
revoke
the
yca
status?
unknown
speaker
do
you
or
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
where
do
they
get
that
authority
to
overrule
a
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judge
says
youth
corrections
act.
unknown
speaker
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
says
no
more.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
counteracted?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you
get
that
authority?
unknown
speaker
did
the
judges
know
that?
unknown
speaker
may.
do
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
does
the
bureau
of
prisons
get
the
right
to
overrule
a
federal
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
changing
it.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying,
in
effect,
is
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
is
the
one
who
has
revoked
or
taken
the
action
which
terminates
the
yca
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
abandoned
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
abandon
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
relying
on
the
judge's
action.
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
the
judge,
the
statement
that
the
youth
corrections
act
is
no
longer
in
force?
do
you
rely
on
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
the
judge's
statement?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
and
you
rely
on
that.
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
the
language
you
quoted
was
in
1975
or
1977?
unknown
speaker
1975.
so
you
say
he
did
make
the
equivalent
of
a
no
benefit
finding
in
1975.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
1977
he
did
not
do
it.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me
in
1975
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
which
the
trial
judge
could
have
imposed
for
the
crime
he
was
found
guilty
of?
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
had
given
a
concurrent
sentence
of
ten
years--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
have
solved
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
pretty
close
to
solving
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
bureau
immediately
treated
him
as
an
adult.
unknown
speaker
and
apparently
said,
ten
years
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
as
an
adult.
unknown
speaker
so
it
did
not
solve
the
problem.
