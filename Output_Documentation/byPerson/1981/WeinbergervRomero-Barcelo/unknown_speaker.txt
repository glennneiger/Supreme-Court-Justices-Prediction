unknown
speaker
mrs.
stillman,
i
take
it
that
the
epa
was
prepared
to
issue
a
permit,
but
was
unable
to
do
so
because
puerto
rico
had
refused
to
certify
compliance
with
local
water
quality
standards.
is
there
no
way
that
the
navy
can
challenge
puerto
rico's
refusal,
or
is
that
going
to
be
a
permanent?
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
happened,
it
would
solve
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
and
also,
i
understand
the
president
could
give
an
exemption
from
the
permit
requirement.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
stillman,
couldn't
the
president
take
care
of
that?
couldn't
he
say
to
the
navy,
we
would
like
you
to
follow
these
restrictions?
he
would
have
the
authority,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
presumably
wants
to
obey
the
law,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
the
power
to
grant
a
total
exemption,
but
do
you
think
it's
correct
to
assume
that
he
would
never
exercise
his
discretion
in
a
sort
of
a
discretionary
way
and
say
well,
i'll
grant
the
exemption
but
only
with
these
strings
attached.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
lose
in
the
proceedings
going
on
in
puerto
rico,
aren't
you
going
to
be
confronted
with
exactly
that
choice?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
relief
should
the
district
court
give?
unknown
speaker
if
that
happens,
then
what
relief
would
be
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
would
be
no,
if
you
lose
in
puerto
rico,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you've
already
told
us
this
is
not
a
routine
case,
this
is
a
very
important
military
area.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
process
of
the
act
if
you
lose
in
puerto
rico?
i
don't
understand
your
position.
if
you
just
can't
get
a
permit,
which
is
certainly
conceivable--
unknown
speaker
--then
your
only
choice,
it
seems
to
me,
is
either
to
comply
with
the
statute
or
to
get
a
presidential
exemption.
unknown
speaker
but
you
may
be
there
in
about
three
days.
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
february
26th
is
the
decision
date?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
stillman,
then
i
take
it
the
government
does
not
contest
the
need
to
get
the
permit?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
remedy
had
comported
with
what
you
thought
was
proper,
they
just
wouldn't
have
enjoined
you
from
doing
it,
from
continuing
with
the
activity.
unknown
speaker
that
is
sort
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you
applied
and
you
didn't
get
it,
then
an
injunction
would
be
proper,
you
think.
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
we
took
this
case
under
advisement
and
if
the
average
time
of
getting
an
opinion
out
is
60
days,
that
the
case
might
be
moot
by
that
time.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
get
the
permit.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
moot
then?
or
is
that
subject
to
review,
administrative
or
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
probably
would
be.
will
we
know
this
by
the
26th?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
board
says
yes,
you
may
have
it,
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
you
to
get
it?
unknown
speaker
should
we
decide
the
case,
if
the
board
says
yes,
you
may
have
a
permit
but
it
will
take
us
some
time
to
get
it
out?
unknown
speaker
is
the
certification
appealable
by,
say,
the
governor
who
is
opposing
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
this
whole
thing
has
been
going
on
for
about
20
years,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
this
whole
problem
has
been
going
on
for
about
20
years,
trying
to
get
the
navy
off
of
there.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
exactly
how
many
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
couldn't
bother
with
that
they
were
so
busy
arguing
it
in
the
newspapers.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
mrs.
stillman,
are
the
exercises
now
suspended?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
power
under
the
statute
in
the
epa
to
grant
any
kind
of
temporary
relief
pending
the
final
resolution
of
these
questions?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
a
temporary
permit
or
anything
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
i'm
asking
whether
there
is
administrative
relief
available
as
well.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
framework
of
the
whole
statute
indicates
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
take
it
out
of
the
realm
of
the
courts,
if
you
will,
and
have
these
problems
solved
administratively,
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
think
that
was
argued
by
the
respondents.
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt
if
i
may.
you
say
it's
just
a
question
of
timing
then,
when
they
must
stop
completely,
assuming
you
don't
get--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
it
any
different
to
stop
six
months
from
now
instead
of
now?
i
don't
understand
what...
it's
not
as
though
you
had
to
build
a
facility
to
get
in
compliance;
just
get
them
to
stop
shooting
off
the
artillery.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
conceding
that
if
you
lose
in
the
other
proceeding,
then
relief
would
be
appropriate.
and
then
would
relief
forthwith
be
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
time
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
from
the
president?
that
the
navy
is
asking
time
to
appeal
to
the
commander-in-chief?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
are
you
serious
about
that
argument?
if
it
is
determined
that
there
is
no
way
to
comply
with
the
statute,
is
there
any
reason
why
an
injunction
should
not
then
issue
forthwith?
if
there
is
a
reason,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
well,
i
won't
ask
you
to.
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
rationale
of
the
compliance
schedule
problem
it
is
that
the
entity
just
needs
time
to
build
the
appropriate
facility
or
something.
but
that's
not
involved
here.
you
just
either
are
going
to
continue
the
activity
or
discontinue
it,
one
of
the
two.
unknown
speaker
well,
sure,
because
there's
a
big
economic
investment
that
has
to
be
taken
care
of.
i
can
understand
that.
but
i
don't
quite
see
how
that
applies
to
this
case,
particularly
when
you've
got
such
a
clear
remedy
available.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
case...
do
you
have
any
support...
i
know
you
rely
on
the
hecht
case...
but
any
case
in
which
a
government
agency
has
been
violating
the
law
and
it
is
within
its
power
to
cease
the
violating
forthwith,
and
the
court
has
said
well,
go
ahead
and
continue
violating?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
illegal
as
of
today.
well,
what...
could
the
court
have
said
you
are
enjoined
until
you
get
the
permit?
wouldn't
that
sort
of
urge
you
to
get
it
a
little
faster?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
the
court...
doesn't
the
court
have
that
authority?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
happen
under
this
if
this
case
had
not
come
up
here,
and
20
years
from
now
they
have
never
gotten
a
permit?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
sort
of
repealing
the
law,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
literally,
i
take
it
you're
suggesting
that
that
court
has
narrowed
the
traditional
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
equity.
unknown
speaker
now,
could
the
congress...
i
don'
t
know
that
we
need
to
decide
it,
but
could
congress
alter
the
scope
of
equity
jurisdiction
which
is
vested
in
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodges,
before
you
get
too
far,
i
would
just
like
to
call
your
attention
to
our
rule
34
with
respect
to
a
summary,
34(1)(h).
your
summary
is
nine
lines
long
and
covers
one
paragraph.
it
doesn't
appear
to
me
that
that
is
a
very
adequate
summary.
i
just
call
your
attention
to
that
for
future
reference.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
a
conclusory
statement
in
your
summary.
and
if
that's
all
you
needed
to
say,
you
didn't
need
to
file
the
rest
of
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodges,
what
is
the
language
of
the
act
you
rely
on
to
cover
discharge
of
munitions?
unknown
speaker
if
i
hit
a
golf
ball
into
the
ocean,
am
i
polluting
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
federal
judge
can't
exercise
any
discretion
in
distinguishing
between
a
golf
ball
or
an
old
sweater
that
gets
blown
off
the
deck
of
a
fishing
vessel
or
something,
and
some
other
genuine
pollutant?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
equity
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
judge
today
is
different
from
what
it
was
in
1787
in
terms
of
traditional
discretion?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
this
statute
is
as
categorical
as
the
three
statutes
involved
in
tva
against
hill.
unknown
speaker
why
go
to
a
court?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
the
court
to
be
a
rubber
stamp,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
the
statute
require
you
to
go
to
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
you
want
the
court
to
do
is
to
grant
you
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
and
it
can't
do
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
right
that
the
only
action
the
court
can
take
is
to
grant
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
to
do
that
without
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean
how
could
the
court
do
it
outside
of
giving
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
admit
that
you
want
an
injunction
or
nothing?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
what
other
statute
can
you
point
to
me
that
says
that
the
only
thing
the
court
can
do
is
to
put
you
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
what
statute
says
the
only
thing
the
court
can
do
is
issue
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
won't
you
agree
there's
no
such
statute?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
agree
there's
no
such
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
agree.
unknown
speaker
i
read
that.
the
only
thing
they
relied
on
was
hill.
unknown
speaker
may
i
correct
you.
did
the
navy
go
to
court
or
did
you
take
them
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference
in
the
power
of
the
court
to
exercise
discretion
on
a
temporary
basis
as
it
was
attempted
here
by
the
district
court,
and
the
case
of
a
permanent
injunction?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
here
we're
dealing
with
inherent
equity
powers
of
the
court.
and
there
is
nothing
express
in
the
act
saying
that
courts
should
not
have
their
inherent
powers.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
all
that
says
is
that,
you
know,
you've
made
out
a
substantive
violation,
but
traditionally
that
is
not
all
that
a
court
of
equity
requires.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodges,
does
the
act
apply
with
the
same
force
to
a
private
operation,
as
you
say
it
does
to
a
government
operation?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
this
case
to
you.
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
pepco
were
operating
a
power
plant
on
the
potomoac
river
that
served
the
city
of
washington,
and
that
the
facts
in
all
other
respects
were
identical
to
this
case.
and
assume
further
that
the
problem
cannot
be
corrected
in
short
of,
say,
three
months.
would
the
court
have
no
authority
to
enter
anything
except
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
let's
assume
all
the
facts
are
exactly
the
same.
unknown
speaker
physically
possible
within
three
months.
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
told
it's
not
physically
possible
to
comply
in
this
case
forthwith.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
answer
to
justice
powell's
hypothetical,
are
you
assuming
that
compliance
on
the
part
of
pepco
could
be
attained
simply
by
shutting
down
its
plant?
and
shutting
down
the
city?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
act
requires
that?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you,
do
you
think
the
act
requires
the
shutting
down
of
the
plant
in
the
example
i
gave?
unknown
speaker
could
you
possibly
answer
it
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
in
three
months.
unknown
speaker
and
you
define
physically
possible
as
shutting
down
the
plant.
unknown
speaker
but
there,
though,
the
people
who
had
originally
brought
the
action
and
seeking
judicial
relief
were
trying
to
get
a
different
kind
of
relief
than
the
epa
provided
for.
and
here
it
seems
to
me
your
people
are
trying
to
invoke
the
epa
statute
and
have
the
courts
just
issue
an
injunction
whenever
you
see
fit.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
does
the
statute
say
in
so
many
words
that
anytime
a
citizens'
suit
is
brought,
the
court
shall
issue
an
injunction
if
it
finds
a
substantive
violation?
does
it
say
that
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
it
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
can
you
refer
me
to
a
section
where
it
says
that?
unknown
speaker
is
the
word
"injunction"
in
any
one
of
those
sections?
unknown
speaker
is
the
word
"injunction"
there.
now,
you
certainly
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
is
the
word
"injunction"
in
any
one
of
those
things?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hodges,
don't
you
really
think
that
tva
versus
hill
can
be
read
as
establishing
the
principle
that
normally,
federal
courts
will,
of
course,
enforce
federal
statutes
and
violations,
but...
and
as
a
matter
of
good
jurisprudence,
the
court
would
not
decline
to
enforce
a
clear
statutory
provision.
however,
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
the
court
has
no
reserved
equitable
power.
i
don't
think
the
court
in
hill
said
that
we
have
no
power
reserved
in
the
federal
courts
to
refuse
an
injunction
within
the
equitable
discretion
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
or
decline
to
act.
is
there
not
that
reserved
power?
isn't
it
a
question
of
how
you
do
it
and
the
things
you
should
properly
look
at?
unknown
speaker
even
on
a
temporary
basis
to
actually
facilitate
the
operation
of
the
congressional
statutory
scheme.
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
a
more
concrete
hypothetical
than
the
one
i
suggested
before
of
a
golf
ball
being
dropped
into
the
ocean.
a
fishing
fleet
goes
out
and
catches
tons
of
fish
in
a
day,
and
many
of
them
clean
the
fish
on
board,
some
mechanically
and
some
manually,
and
dump
the
refuse,
the
heads
and
entrails
of
fish,
overboard.
and...
now,
that's
presented
without
a
permit,
no
permit.
they
go
to
the
district
court
to
get
an
injunction
and
a
marine
biologist
says
that
far
from
being
bad,
this
is
good.
big
fish
eat
smaller
fish
and
small
fish
eat
still
smaller
fish.
and
that
therefore,
there
is
no
harm
to
the
environment,
and
on
the
contrary,
it's
an
aid,
a
natural
process.
are
you
suggesting
that
a
district
judge
could
not
exercise
his
discretion,
and
weighing
the
testimony
of
the
marine
biologist
against
the
opposing
testimony
say
no,
i
will
not
grant
an
injunction
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
we're
talking
about,
here.
you're
more
familiar
with
it
than
we
are.
you've
been
living
with
it
longer.
unknown
speaker
what's
your
answer
to
my
hypothetical,
then?
unknown
speaker
then
your
answer
is
that
the
district
judge
could
not
exercise
his
discretion
and
deny
an
injunction
in
the
case
i
have
just
given
you
hypothetically.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
same
thing
would
go
for
the
net,
then,
even
if
they
didn't
dump
anything
in
the
ocean.
if
they
just
put
the
nets
in
to
fish
and
the
testimony
was
well,
these
nets
are
as
clean
as
they
can
be.
nevertheless,
you're
putting
something
in
the
water.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
discharging
something
out
of
the
ship.
maybe
only
temporarily,
but
there
it
is.
unknown
speaker
how
about
launching
a
new
ship?
it's
going
to
be
on
the
water
forever.
unknown
speaker
ms.
stillman,
i
wanted
to
ask
one
question
about
that,
because
i
guess
the
whole
part
of
the
opinion
you
object
to
is
the
pages
48
and
49
of
the
appendix
to
your
cert
petition.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
really
one
long
paragraph.
and
early
in
that
part,
the
court
of
appeals
says
there's
an
absolute
statutory
obligation,
which
sounds
like
they
mean
there's
always
got
to
be
injunctive
relief.
but
really
they're
talking
about
the
violation
there,
not
the
remedy.
unknown
speaker
and
then
later
they
point
out
that...
they
cite
a
couple
of
district
court
cases
that
i
have
no
read,
and
then
they
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
statutory
violation
was
deemed
technical.
here,
the
navy
has
utterly
disregarded
the
statutory
mandate.
it
sounds
to
me
there
like
they're
saying
maybe
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
judge
to--
unknown
speaker
--otherwise,
why
would
they
draw
a
distinction
between
a
technical
violation
and
utter
disregard
of
the
statutory
mandate,
when
they're
talking
about
remedy?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
would
the
government
be
satisfied
with
a
remand
for
a
decision
under
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
rather
than...
is
that
all
you're
asking?
what
relief
are
you
asking
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
would
you
have
sought
review
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
clearly
said,
we
think
when
there
is
a
flagrant,
utter
disregard
of
a
statute,
as
there
has
been
here,
that
in
that
case
it's
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
grant
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
i
hope
the
future
doesn't
do
to
this
case
what
the
future
did
to
the
dam
case.
unknown
speaker
the
future
did
to
the
dam
case,
it
said
that
it
wasn't
true.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
it
says
there's
an
absolute
statutory
obligation.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
they
don't
say
there's
no
range
of
remedial
responses.
that's
part
of
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
well.
