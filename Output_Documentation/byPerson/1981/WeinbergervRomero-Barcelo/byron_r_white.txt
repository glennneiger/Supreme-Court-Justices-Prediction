no.
80-1990,
weinberger
against
romero-barcelo
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
that
court
held
that
whenever
it
is
shown
that
a
person
is
polluting
coastal
waters,
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
requires
the
district
court
enter
an
injunction
and
removes
any
discretion
that
the
district
court
might
otherwise
have
to
deny
an
injunction
pending
an
application
for
a
permit
under
the
act.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
the
reasons
we
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file,
we
hold
that
the
water
control
act
does
not
completely
foreclose
the
district
court
from
taking
equitable
considerations
into
account
and
from
denying
injunctive
relief
pending
action
on
an
application
for
a
permit
which
if
issued
would
allow
the
pending
discharges
to
continue.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
