ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
petitioners
seeking
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
are
the
secretary
of
defense
and
officers
of
the
navy
and
the
marine
corps.
this
action,
which
was
brought
by
the
governor
of
puerto
rico
and
others
to
enjoin
the
navy's
use
of
vieques
island
for
weapons
training,
raised
claims
under
a
number
of
different
statutes.
but
the
issue
for
review
in
this
court
is
simply
whether
a
district
court,
upon
finding
a
violation
of
section
301(a)
of
the
clean
water
act
respecting
discharges
of
pollutants
is
required,
regardless
of
circumstances,
to
enter
an
order
directing
the
immediate
cessation
of
the
activity
producing
the
discharge.
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
act
as
imposing
such
a
constraint
on
the
court's
remedial
discretion,
and
it
thus
held
that
the
district
court
lacks
discretion
to
enter
a
less
extreme
order
requiring
the
navy
promptly
to
seek
a
national
pollutant
discharge
elimination
system
permit,
commonly
termed
an
npdes
permit,
for
the
intermittent
discharge
of
pollutants
into
the
waters
of
vieques
island
that
are
part
of
the
principal
naval
weapons
training
area
for
the
atlantic
fleet.
petitioners
submit
that
neither
the
language
nor
the
purposes
of
this
act
require
this
constraint
on
a
district
court's
traditional
exercise
of
discretion
in
shaping
equitable
relief.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
represents
an
unprecedented
construction
of
the
clean
water
act,
requiring
an
all-or-nothing
approach
to
enforcement
which
would
preclude
any
kind
of
credible
enforcement
program
by
epa
or
by
authorized
state
agencies.
before
discussing
these
larger
implications
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
however,
i
would
first
like
briefly
to
summarize
some
of
the
factual
findings
which
led
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
the
order
it
entered
adequately
vindicated
the
interests
of
the
clean
water
act.
the
eastern
half
of
vieques
island
is
part
of
what
is
known
as
the
inner
range
of
the
atlantic
fleet
weapons
training
facility
headquartered
at
roosevelt
roads
naval
station
on
the
main
island
of
puerto
rico.
ships,
planes
and
marines
landing
in
amphibious
maneuvers
fire
at
air-to-ground
targets,
ship-to-shore
targets,
and
artillery
targets
located
in
narrow
zone
on
the
eastern
end
of
vieques.
both
inert
and
live
ordnance
is
used.
the
exercises
which
take
place
some
200
days
a
year
are
coordinated
from
roosevelt
roads
and
from
an
observation
point
on
vieques.
they
are
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
operational
qualification
standards
for
the
atlantic
fleet.
vieques
is
the
only
location
presently
available
in
which
the
fleet
can
engage
in
a
full
range
of
exercises
simulating
the
conditions
of
actual
combat.
in
the
course
of
these
exercises,
some
of
the
ordnance
misses
the
land-base
targets
and
drops
into
waters
within
the
three
mile
limit
of
vieques.
under
terms
of
the
clean
water
act,
this
is
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant
from
a
point
source,
requiring
an
npdes
permit.
this
is
so
because
the
definition
of
pollutants
includes
munitions,
and
a
point
source
is
any
discrete
conveyance
including
vessels.
epa
has
never
developed
any
effluent
limitation
guidelines
for
a
point
source
class
or
category
of
military
forces
conducting
weapons
exercises.
hence,
the
navy
committed
no
violation
of
any
existing
technology-based
effluent
limitation
under
the
act.
and
the
district
court,
following
the
trial
of
some
50
days,
determined
that
the
navy's
activities
did
not
violate
any
of
puerto
rico's
water
quality
laws,
that
no
credible
evidence
established
that
the
discharges
had
any
measurable
deleterious
effect
on
the
vieques
waters,
and
indeed,
that
there
was
no
appreciable
harm
to
the
vieques
ecology.
in
fact,
the
court
concluded
that
the
navy's
presence
on
vieques
had,
on
the
whole,
worked
to
the
benefit
rather
than
the
detriment
of
the
environment
there.
and
this
was
so
because
the
navy
had
to
place
restrictions
on
a
large
area
around
the
area
in
which
the
weapons
training
is
carried
on,
and
these
restrictions
limited
the
amount
of
human
trespassing
that
had
caused
problems
for
some
of
the
area...
would
have
caused
problems
absent
these
restrictions.
in
sum,
on
the
record
there
appeared
to
be
no
violation
of
any
water
quality
standards
or
any
technology-based
standards,
and
the
navy's
lack
of
an
npdes
permit
was
the
only
apparent
violation
of
the
clean
water
act.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
the
navy
can
challenge
the
refusal.
i
must
say
that
that
is
still
in
litigation
at
the
administrative
stage
in
puerto
rico.
there
is
still
a
motion
for
reconsideration
pending,
at
least
the
last
time
i
checked.
and
we
understand
that
the
environmental
quality
board
there
will
probably
issue
a
decision
on
that
february
26.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
if
they
grant
the
certification
i
think
the
permit
probably
would
issue
then
because
epa
has
developed
a
draft
permit
under
which,
i
might
add,
the
navy
would
be
required
to
monitor
water
quality
and
make
reports.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes,
he
could.
i
was
going
to
get
to
this
later
in
my
talk,
but
since
you
bring
it
up
i'll
address
it
now.
section
313
of
the
act
provides
for
a
presidential
exemption.
there
are
two
kinds
of
exemptions.
there
is
one
exemption
for
an
effluent
source
of
any
agency,
executive
branch
agency
or
department,
for
one
year.
it's
an
exemption
except
from
sections
306
and
307
of
the
act,
if
the
president
finds
it
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
to
do
so.
there's
a
second
exemption
provision
which
may
be
given
for
three
years.
it
has
to
be
done
by
regulation.
and
this
can
be
for
weapons
of
the
military
forces
and
related
military
equipment.
now,
respondents
have
suggested,
and
certainly,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
rely
on
this
also,
that
the
existence
of
this
exemption
provision
somehow
meant
that
the
district
court
was
denied
discretion
to
do
what
it
did
in
the
case
here.
that
this
exemption
provision
must
be
the
only
way
that
you
can
ever
allow,
even
for
a
limited
time,
any
carrying
out
of
military
exercises
without
the
permit.
we
strongly
believe
this
is
wrong.
for
one
thing,
i
think
it's
got
to
be
understood
that
the
exemption
is
not
the
equivalent
of
what
the
district
court
did
here.
under
the
three-year
exemption,
the
navy
would
not
be
required
to
do
what
it
will
be
required
to
do
under
this
permit.
under
the
permit,
if
it
issues,
the
navy
will
be
required
to
monitor,
i
believe,
nine
different,
they
call
them
parameters,
but
it's
monitoring
for
rhinos
like
iron
and
acidity
and
so
on.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
he
could,
but
under
the
statute
we
think,
that--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--but
he
could
issue
the
exemption
without
disobeying
the
law.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
i
don't
suggest
there
are
limits
on
his
discretion.
we're
simply
saying
that
we
think
the
best
accommodation
under
the
best
way
of
accommodating
the
interests
of
the
clean
water
act
here
is
to
find
a
solution
where
the
court
doesn't
have
to
choose
between
on
the
one
hand
saying
that
national
defense
efforts
will
be
held
up,
and
on
the
other
hand
saying
get
an
exemption,
which
may
not
require
you
to
do
anything.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
that's
right,
the
navy
would
be
confronted
with
that
choice,
but
we
think
unless--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
if...
may
i
say
that
one
of
the
factors
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
seek
an
immediate
cessation
order
on
the
part
of
the
government
is
whether
you
think
the
applicant
seeking
the
permit
will
ever
be
able
to
comply.
if
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--if
we
lose.
but...
that's
right.
if
you
came
to
some
point
where
it
was
clear
there
were
no
appeal
procedures,
that
they
were
going
to
refuse
the
certification,
at
that
point
i
think
the
exemption
clearly...
we
think
that
that
is
what
the
exemption
was
created
for.
these
exemptions
were
not
created
to
be
a
routine
use;
that
is,
the--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--well,
that's
true.
but
we
think
that
it's
better
to
have
water
quality
standards
set
by
the
epa
than
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget,
the
president's
executive
branch.
that
is,
it
betters
serves
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
let
the
situation
be
handled
under
the
processes
of
the
act,
if
that's
possible.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
right,
it's
conceivable.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
that's
true
at
that
point,
but
we
are
not
at
that
point
in
the
case,
and
the
district
court
was
not
at
that
point
when
it
issued
the
order
here.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
because
there--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--but
there
are
appeal
procedures
from
that.
that
is
not
a
final
order.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
does
not
contest
the
need
to
get
the
permit?
oh,
no,
no,
we
did
not
appeal
from
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
act.
that
is
a
technical
violation.
we
did
not
appeal
the
court's
finding
that
this
was
covered
by
the
permit
provisions.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
there
is
an
order
entered.
the
order
says
to
the
navy,
you
have
to
apply
for
a
permit.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
if
it
were
absolutely
clear
that
no
permit...
at
the
very
end
where
it
becomes
clear
that
the
denial
of
certification
is
going
to
stick
and
that
there
is
no
further
recourse,
at
that
point
we
might
say
the
injunction
is
proper.
but
even
there,
there
might
be
provision,
an
equitable
provision
for
reasonable
time
to
get
the
exemption
issued.
i
don't
want
to
give
up
on
that.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
doubt
that
very
much,
your
honor,
simply
because
this
opinion
that
may
issue
from
the
environmental
quality
board
on
the
26th
is
not
the
final
word,
necessarily.
we
have
various
appeal
routes
that
we
can
take,
and
so
i
don't
see
how
the
case
would
be
moot
at
that
point.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
if
we
get
the
permit--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--there
are
review
provisions
for
attacking
the
permit.
i
think
once
we
have
the
permit
in
its
final...
if
the
permit
is
only
in
draft
form...
now,
once
we
have
the
permit
in
its
final,
certainly
the
case
would
probably
be
moot
at
that
point.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
we
would
advise...
oh,
well,
we
wouldn't
have
the
permit
by
the
26th.
there
are
a
lot
more
procedures
that
have
to
be
gone
through.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
your
honor,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
long
these
procedures
take.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
am
advised
that
it
might
take
90
days
to
get
the
final
permit,
even
after
the
certification
is
issued.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
suppose
the
governor
could
object
to...
i
don't
think
it's
a
case
in
which
only
one
side
can
take
an
appeal.
i
should
say
that
the
environmental
quality
board
is
part
of
the
governor's
office.
i
was
just
reminded.
however,
it
may
be
one
of
those
agencies
like
the
national
labor
relations
board...
it
may
be
a
split
agency
where
there
would
be
someone
who
could
take
an
appeal.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
it
has
a
long
history,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
the
navy
has
been
there
since
world
war
ii,
and
there
has
been
some
kind
of
target
practice
going
on
there
since
i
believe
at
least
the
late
sixties
and
early
seventies,
and
it
started,
i
think
the
findings
indicated
in
its
present
intensity
at
least,
in
1975.
and
i
might
say
that
a
witness
from
epa
who
testified
in
the
trial
hearing
indicated
that
epa
had
never
had
any
requests
from
the
environmental
quality
board
in
puerto
rico
to
find
that
the
shelling
activity
was
a
violation
of
the
clean
water
act.
they
had
had
some
notification
concerning
suits.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i
don't
know
about
that.
i
do
know
that
their
complaint
was
something
of
a
shotgun
complaint
and
they
did
seem
to
be
relying
on
a
number
of
grounds
and
the
clean
water
act
was
only
one
part
of
the
case,
and
that
is
the
part
that
has
come
up
here.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
they
are
not.
they
are
not.
and
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we're
concerned
about
this
case
not
just
because
of
the
navy,
although
certainly
that's
a
very
strong
interest
here.
we're
concerned
about
the
workings
of
the
clean
water
act
as
a
whole
because
the
use
of
compliance
schedules
has
just
been
common
place
in
this
statute.
if
it
were
really
the
case
that
when
epa
wanted
to
take
an
enforcement
action
against
a
discharger
of
pollutants
who
is
in
violation
of
301(a)
of
the
act,
which
covers
a
number
of...
you
can
be
in
violation
in
terms
of
your
permit
or
not
have
a
permit
and
so
on--
if
the
question
they
have
to
face
is
either
we
don't
take
any
action
at
all
or
we
have...
we
go
to
court,
and
the
only
action
that
can
be
taken
is
that
they're
going
to
shut
down
the
whole
operation,
it
really
would
make
this
act
unworkable,
and
the
act
has
never
worked
that
way.
this
decision
of
the
first
circuit
really
was
quite
unprecedented
and
just
simply
not
consistent
with
the
way
the
statute
has
worked.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
on
the
part
of
epa
administratively?
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
epa
can
issue
administrative
compliance
orders--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
the
court,
by...
this
action
was
in
court,
so
it's
really
a
question
of
what
the
court
was
going
to
do
here.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
under
section
309,
the
administrator
can
issue
compliance
orders,
and...
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
temporary
relief.
i
guess
that's
what
i'
m
not
sure.
what
we're
trying
to
suggest
is
that
there
are
a
whole
range
of
remedial
responses,
either
administratively
or
judicially,
which
can
take
the
form
of,
for
example
in
some
of
these
consent
decrees,
having
civil
penalties
for
every
day
that
they
are
not
meeting
the
schedule.
but
this,
of
course,
comes
up
in
a
citizens'
suit,
and
so
it
is
not
in
the
framework
of
a
general
enforcement
action.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
your
honor,
do
i
understand...
are
you
touching
on
the
point
that
respondents
made
that
somehow
the
discretion
that
we
want
to
give
the
court
here
is
undermining
epa's
permit
review?
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i
don't
think
that's
happening
here.
for
one
thing,
when
a
citizens'
suit
is
filed,
epa
gets
notice
and
the
administrator
can
intervene
or
file
his
own
suit,
or...
and
he
is
free
at
any
time.
if
the
administrator
thought
that
there
was
a
situation
here
that
demanded
emergency
action,
that
demanded
immediate
cessation
remedy,
he
has
emergency
powers
under
section
504
of
the
act
to
go
in
and
ask
the
court
for
that.
evidently,
epa
did
not
think
that
was
the
case.
and
also,
i
might
point
out
that
the
order
that
the
court
has
given
here
is
to
invoke
the
epa
review
processes.
that
is,
they
ordered
the
navy,
go
get
the
permit,
at
which
point
the
navy
has
to
submit
an
application
to
epa.
and
epa
has
not
been
left
out
of
this
process.
it
is
not
cordoned
off
by
what
the
court
did
here
in
any
way,
and
we
don't
think
that
it
really
undermines
epa's
participation
or
epa's
role.
i
would
like
to
also
touch
on
the
reliance
that
the
other
side
has
placed
on
tva
against
hill
and
steelworkers
against
united
states,
because
they
suggested
that
this
is
just
a
case
in
which
we
are
trying
to
say
pay
no
attention
to
what
congress
did;
congress
did
something
very
unwise
here,
and
do
it
this
way
because
we
think
this
is
a
better
way
of
doing
it.
we
think
tva
v.
hill
was
a
very
different
case.
in
that
case,
the
injunction
sought
was
to
enjoin
the
closing
of
the
gates
of
tellico
dam.
if,
in
fact,
those
gates
had
been
closed,
this
would
have
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
the
critical
habitat
of
an
endangered
species,
against
the
direct
prohibition
of
the
statute.
and
this
kind
of
irreversible
and
prohibited
result
was
inconsistent
with
what
congress
seemed
clearly
to
require.
in
the
steelworkers
case
there
was
a
very
specific
remedial
directive
from
congress...
upon
making
these
factual
findings,
give
the
80-day
taft-hartley
injunction.
now,
that
is
a
very
different
situation
from
the
provision
for
judicial
relief
in
this
case.
as
i
said,
there
is
a
provision
for
immediate
cessation
orders;
that
is
in
section
504
of
the
act.
and
that
is
upon
certain
emergency
findings.
now,
we
don't,
of
course,
suggest
that
the
fact
that
that
remedy
is
specified
in
section
504
means
it
would
be
unavailable
in
federal
enforcement
suits
under
309
or
in
citizens'
suits
under
505.
we
only
suggest
that
since
congress
didn't
even
mention
it
in
these
other
two
statutes,
it
can't
have
meant
that
that
was
the
only
remedy
that
could
be
given
in
those
statutes.
i
also
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
kind
of
discretion
that
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
discretion
to
time
final
compliance.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there's
any
discretion
to
vary
standards
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
the
court
would
not
be
free
to
say
well,
this
discharger
is
not
harming
water
quality
standards;
therefore,
he
is
not
going
to
have
to
comply
with
the
technology-based
effluent
limitation.
the
court
can't
do
that.
the
court
also
couldn't
say
well,
there's
a
discharge
here
but
it's
quite
harmless
and
it
looks
to
us
pretty
unimportant,
and
so
therefore,
we're
going
to
excuse
him
from
compliance
with
the
permit.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
the
timing
in
this
case...
if
they
get
this
permit,
the
draft
permit,
they
won't
have
to
stop.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i
was
trying
to
suggest
that
it
might
be
open
to
a
court
of
equity
to
provide
time
to
get--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--get
the
exemption.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--i
see
the
logic
of
your
position,
your
honor.
i'm
reluctant
to
make
these
kinds
of
concessions,
but
no,
i
consider
if--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--i
understand
that
it
certainly
makes
sense
to
say
if
it's
clear
that
a
discharger
cannot
comply
with
the
act
ever,
that
probably
the
rationale
for
certainly
compliance
schedules
don't
make
too
much
sense.
however,
i
should
say--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--while
we
are
seeking
to
comply
with
the
act.
it
takes
a
while
to
go
through
the
permit
process.
we
think
the
principle
should
operate
in
both
cases.
i
might
say
also
on
the
other
point,
that
sometimes
a
discharger
will
say
to
epa,
we've
decided,
we
understand
that
we
are
never
going
to
be
able
to
meet
these
effluent
limitations.
and
in
that
case,
they
announce
an
intent
to
cease
their
activity.
but
even
in
that
case,
sometimes
schedules
are
worked
out--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--well,
your
honor,
are
you
suggesting
that
this
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
that
there
is
no
discretion?
because
i
think
the
question
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
is
not
really
up
here.
what's
up
here
is
what
the
first
circuit
said,
which
is
the
court
simply
has
no
discretion
in
these
cases,
and
that's
really
what
we
are--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--well,
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
case
that
has
quite
the
facts
of
this
where
ceasing
the
violation
forthwith
is
ceasing
an
activity
which
would
be
permitted
under
the
permit
that
it's
seeking.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
it
might,
but
we
are
only
suggesting
that
the
court
didn't
have
to
do
that.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
we
say
the
court
has...
certainly,
the
court
has
equitable
discretion.
and
even
a
court
of
equity
exercising
the
kind
of
discretion
that
we're
saying
it
has
here,
of
course,
has
discretion
to
enter
an
injunction
upon
a
proper
balance
of
factors.
but
as
we
understand
the
question
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
resolve,
it
is
does
the
court
have
discretion
to
enter
this
kind
of
order
upon
a
proper
showing
of
factors.
and
that
is
what
the
first
circuit
said,
is
they
don't.
once
there's
a
violation,
once
there
is
a
literal
violation
of
the
act,
that's
it,
and
you
have
to
have
an
immediate
cessation
of
the
discharge.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i
know
the
mills
grind
slowly,
but
i
expect
that
there
will
be
a
final
answer
before
20
years
are
out.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
no,
we
don't
believe
so.
we
think
that
the
navy
has
been
ordered
to
apply
for
this
permit,
it's
going
through
the
process
in
good
faith,
it's
doing
the
best
it
can
to
get
the
permit.
what
slowed
it
up,
quite
frankly,
is
the
refusal
of
the
environmental
quality
board
of
puerto
rico
to
certify,
even
though
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
looking
at
this
discharge
didn't
think
it
was
covered...
or
violated
puerto
rico
water
quality
laws.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
correct.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
congress
may.
we
don't
believe
it
did
so
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
could.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
just
three
points,
your
honor.
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
section
313
of
the
act
applicable
to
federal
facilities
does
say
that
federal
facilities
shall
be
covered
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
any
non-governmental
entity.
and
therefore,
if
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
the
navy
here
is
true,
it
would
be
true
of
electric
plants,
it
would
be
true
of
these
dams
that
we
brought
up
in
terms
of
the
case
we
cited--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--that's
true.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
certainly,
we
think
the
case
might
well
be
held...
i'll
admit
that
they
haven't
spoken
with
utmost
clarity
there,
but
we
argued
in
our
petition
for
cert
that
this
was
a
very
far-reaching--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--we've
never
suggested
that
we
didn't
think
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
equitable
discretion
to
look
at
all
factors
and
balance
and
so
on.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
we
would
strongly
disagree
with
that
finding
on
the
court
of
appeals'
part.
whether
we
would
regard
the
case
as
cert
worthy
then
might
be
another
question.
but
we
certainly
don't
think
that
the
navy
flagrantly
disregarded
anything.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
been
meaning
by
that
was
just
that
there
was
a
clear
statute
and
the
navy
violated
it.
i
might
say
that
it
may
look
clear
in
hindsight.
people
just
didn't
think
that
this
kind
of
exercise
was
covered
until
these
matters
finally
got
into
litigation.
and
this
act
is
full
of
surprises,
may
i
say.
there
may
be,
just
like
the
dam
case
that
we
cited,
you
might
say
that
if
it's
true
that
those
dams
are
all
point
sources
that
they're
in
flagrant
disregard
of
the
statute.
and
we
don't
think
that
that
means
that
if
you
bring
a
suit
against
one
of
those
dams
now
that
they
have
to--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
i
would
also
like
to
say
that
it's
not
true
that
a
permit
can
be
obtained
forthwith.
it's
not
like
applying
for
a
library
card.
and
also,
i
would
like
finally
to
address
the
question
that
counsel
posed,
which
is
what
did
congress
provide
in
this
statute?
what
we
say
congress
provided
was
some
rather
absolute
prohibitions,
and
sections
governing
enforcement
which
do
not
specify
that
there
has
to
be
an
injunction
of
the
kind
which
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
specified.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
yes.
we
don't
agree
that
there
is
no
range
of
remedial
responses
when
a
violation
is
found.
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
well,
your
honor,
we
assume
that
cert
was
granted--
ms.
elinor
h.
stillman
--because
the
court
read
it
as
we
did,
or
four
members
did.
your
honor,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
