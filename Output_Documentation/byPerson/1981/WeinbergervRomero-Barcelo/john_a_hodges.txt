mr.
john
a.
hodges
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
simple
and
stark
fact.
the
district
judge,
judge
torruella,
made
a
determination
that
congress
determined
should
be
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that.
we
do
feel
that
this
case
does
present
a
simple
question.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
we
believe
that
this
case
presents
an
overriding
consideration
of
the
proper
allocation
of
functions
among
the
three
branches
of
the
government.
if
ever
there
was
a
comprehensive
statute,
it
is
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
in
fact,
this
court
pounded
that
point
home
again
and
again
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois.
indeed,
congress
addressed
and
resolve
the
very
question
that
is
at
issue
here.
it
laid
down
an
explicit
requirement
that
prohibited
federal
facilities
from
discharging
munitions
into
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
without
a
permit.
the
permit
is,
indeed,
the
core
of
this
act.
it
defines
and
facilitates
both
compliance
and
enforcement.
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
indicates--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
section
30...
a
combination
of
section
301(a)
of
the
act
which
states
that
except
as
in
compliance
with,
among
other
things,
section
402
of
the
act,
all
discharges
are
prohibited.
i
then
tie
that
into
section
313(a)
of
the
act,
which
provides
that
the
federal
facilities
shall
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act.
and
then
i
tie
into
the
definitions
section
of
the
act,
which
defines
pollutants
as
including
munitions.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
that...
it
is
quite
possible
that
you
might
be.
that
case
is
not
this
case.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
may
be
other
cases.
congress
has
not
indicated
that
a
court
would
have
that
kind
of
discretion.
i
would
say,
however,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
case,
congress
has
specifically
identified
munitions
to
fall
within
this
prohibition.
it
has
addressed
this
question
and
has
resolved
it.
other
questions
could
come
up...
shooting
a
duck,
for
example.
i
know
that's
been
raised
by
the
government.
some
day
we
may
end
up
with
a
duck
case,
but
the
duck
case
doesn't
decide
that
case
here.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
in
regard
to
that
i
would
like
to
your
honor's
decision,
this
court's
decision
and
your
honor's
opinion
in
tva
v.
hill,
which
indeed,
this
court
has
applied
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois
case
in
which
it
stated
that
the
concepts
of
equity
jurisprudence
only
go
so
far.
and
once
a
court
is
facing
a
statutory
violation,
and
once
congress
has
spoken
and
has
said
what
it
wants
done,
and
if
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional,
and
there's
no
question
about
that
here,
then
should
enforcement
be
sought
and
liability
be
shown,
enforcement
should
be
given
by
the
court.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
there
is
no
distinction
between
thou
shalt
not
kill
this
three-inch
fish,
and
thou
shalt
not
pollute
without
a
permit.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
we--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
the
reason
we
went
to
court
was
because
of
the
fact--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
section
505
of
this
statute
provides
for
a
citizens'
suit
where
a
federal
facility
or
other
person
is
violating
the
act,
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
again,
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
all
other
cases
that
may
arise
under
this
act.
what
we
are
trying
to
do--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
what
we
are
asking
is
an
affirmance
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
which
is
that
forthwith,
the
district
court
should
take
all
steps
to
assure
that
no
further
illegal
discharges
of
munitions
are
taking
place
until
the
permit
is
obtained
or
a
presidential
exemption
is--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
your
honor,
if
the
navy--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--if
the
navy
would
halt
its--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--the
court--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
that
is
what
we
want.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
here
is--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--well,
your
honor,
this
would
not
be
going
to
jail.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
in
this--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--this
raises
a
very
good
point,
because--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
the
traditional
test
under--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
the
traditional
test...
and
we
try
to
point
this
out...
reconciling
the
hecht
case,
the
rondeau
case,
and--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
i
think
the
point
here
is
the
fact
that
we
have
prohibitions.
we
have
a
congress
that
has
addressed
the
particular
question
involved
and
it
has
said
exactly
how
it
wants
it
to
be
handled.
now,
it
provided
a
grace
period.
the
federal
facility
had
a
choice.
it
was
given
by
congress
a
grace
period
which
expired
in
1974,
and
if
it
didn't
want
to
have
that
permit,
it
could
go
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
which
then,
if
that
exemption
were
granted,
would
have
to
be
reported
to
congress.
now,
the
judges...
the
judicial
branch
was
the
only
branch
of
the
three
that
was
left
out
of
the
exemption
process.
if
there
is
any
example
of
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius,
this
is
it.
the
judiciary
was
kept
out
of
this
process,
and
for
a
very
good
reason.
first,
congress
said
that's
the
way
they
wanted
to
handle
it,
and
secondly,
the
presidential
exemption
procedure
is
inherently
a
political,
technical
and
indeed,
a
military
determination
that
a
district
court
really
isn't
very
good
at
making
that
kind
of
determination.
but
what
did
the
district
court
do
in
this
case?
the
navy,
when
it
was
finally
sued,
went
to
the
district
court
and
induced
it
to
release
it
for
the
interim
period
until
it...
while
it
was
attempting
to
get
a
permit--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--we
took
them
to
court,
and
what
they
sought
at
that
point...
and
they
succeeded...
was
the
district
judge
made
a
determination
at
that
point...
and
i
quote
his
words,
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
present
state
of
world
affairs
and
other
factors
that
he
considered,
that
he
considered
to
be
reasonable
and
equitable,
and
he
determined
that
it
would
be
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
of
america,
in
his
determination,
that
the
navy
be
allowed
to
continue
to
violate
the
statute
while
it
sought
to
get
that
permit.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
the
court
of
appeals
did
exactly
what
the
various
determinations
of
this
court
has
been;
it
applied
the
statute
with
an
acute
view
towards
the
purposes
of
indeed
this
statute.
it
saw
that
compliance
could
be
immediate;
there
were
no
facilities
that
had
to
be
built
or
anything
else.
it
focused
on
these
particular
requirements,
which
was
301,
the
requirement
with
402.
you
need
to
have
that
permit
before
you
pollute.
he
said,
if
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
thing,
you
go
and
you
see
the
president.
but
he
did
not
do
what
the
district
court
did,
and
i
think
that
properly
held
that
under
those
circumstances,
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
no.
we
would
say
that
because...
congress
didn't
write
the
law
in
that
way.
what
congress
said,
as
it
has
been
repeatedly
construed
by
this
court,
that
you
must
have
a
permit
before
you
pollute.
and
because
of
that
fact,
it
didn't
say--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
i
would
say
that
there
is.
we
have
a...
all
that
is
necessary
we
believe
in
the
case
is
the
substantive
prohibition;
the
substantive
prohibition
that
comes
from
section
301(a)
combined
with
section
402.
you
need
to
have
that
permit
before
you
pollute.
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
it...
to
allow
the
expert
agencies
to
take
a
look
at
this
thing.
you
do
not
need--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
what
the
court
of
equity
has
required...
again,
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
tradition
we're
speaking
of.
i
would
agree
with
that
if
we
were
speaking
of
a
situation
where
there
was
no
statute
that
was
being
violated.
but
where
a
statute
has
been
violated,...
and
i
now
refer
to
the
decision
in
the
rondeau
v.
mosinee
paper
corporation,
and
in
the
facts
of
the
hecht
case
where
compliance
has
been
achieved...
there
was
a
violation
but
there
was
no
further
violation...
there
was
no
need
to
grant
an
injunction.
but
where...
and
i'm
now
referring
to
the
rondeau
case...
the
traditional
test
of
the
granting
of
injunctive
relief
is,
one,
is
there
a
violation,
and
secondly,
is
that
violation
ongoing.
and
that
is
precisely
the
case
here.
there
is
no
question
that
the
navy
has
violated
the
statute,
and
there's
no
question
that
they
continued
to
violate
it
at
the
time
the
act
was
done
and
they
are
doing
it
now.
over
1000
bombs
were
dropped
into
the
coastal
waters
of
vieques
in
the
first
seven
months
of
1981.
if
there
ever
was
an
ongoing
violation,
that's
it.
congress
said
you
can't
do
that.
now,
you
can
go
to
the
president,
the
president
can
release
you,
but
you
can't
do
it
in
the
way
that
the
navy
has
done
it.
the
district
courts
simply
don't
have
that
competence
to
be
able...
to
make
the
determination.
the
president
and
the
courts
are
drinking
out
of
different
wells,
as
it
were.
think
of
the
way
in
which
a
determination
is
reached
by
a
court
and
the
way
it's
reached
by
the
president.
the
president
has
the
panoply
of
materials,
computers,
position
papers,
he
can
draw
on
anybody
he
wants
to.
he
can
draw
on
the
navy,
he
can
draw
on
the
state
department,
he
can
draw
on
a
number
of
things.
the
district
court
is
faced
with
the
record;
it
can't
even
actually
take
judicial
notice
of
the
president's
state
of
affairs--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
section
313
of
the
act
ties
the
federal
facilities
into
the
other
requirements
of
the
act,
but
it
does
apply
to
private
persons,
also.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
i
think
that...
let
me
address
it
in
a
couple
of
ways.
first,
we
are
restricted
here
to
a
situation
of
operation
without
a
permit.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
someone
does
have--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
i
think
that
if
compliance
is
physically
possible,
then
yes,--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--if
it
is
physically
possible
to
comply
forthwith,
compliance
should
be
required.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
all
they
have
to
do
is
stop
dumping
those
things
in
the
water.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
that
is
quite
possible,
your
honor.
i
think
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
this
case.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
i
think
the
navy
has
raised
the
point
where
they
said
look,
dams
are
a
point
source.
there
again,
i--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
i
think
that
in
a
case
where
compliance
is
physically
possible--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--if
it
is
physically
possible,
yes,
it
would
require
it.
because--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--during
that
interim
period
if
it
is
physically
possible,
they
would
be
required--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
sir,
i
would.
let
me
refer
again
to
the
other
cases
which
this
court
has
decided.
in
e.i.
dupont
versus
train,
again,
the
court
was
faced
with
the
situation
of
a
new
source
performance
situation.
and
the
court
was
asked
please
agree
to
the
variance
here;
and
the
court
refused
to
do
that.
they
said
look,
the
question
isn't
whether
or
not
this
is
what
is
generally
appropriate.
the
question
is
what
did
congress
intend
with
respect
to
these
particular
questions,
these
particular
provisions.
there
is
no
exception...
there
is
no
different
timetable
than
the
one
that
the
court...
that
congress
established.
it
provided
for
a
grace
period
already.
that's
been
slipped.
i
don't
think
that
we're
going
to
find
ourselves
in
a
wholesale
situation
where
everybody
in
the
world
is
going
to
be
shut
down.
what
is
the
class
of
people
who
are
going
to
be
gotten
by
this?
we're
going
to
have
the
people
who
slipped
that
deadline,
somehow
snuck
through
and
didn't
get...
didn't
meet
the
deadline
and
now
have
been
caught
dead
to
rights.
generally,
that
is
what
is
going
to
be
happening.
and
under
those
circumstances,...
congress
can
change
this
act
if
it
wishes
to
do
so.
and
maybe
the
navy
has
made
a
case
that
they
should
be
presenting
to
the
congress.
but
it
is
not
up
to
the
courts
to
do
this.
and
indeed,
the
concept
of
separation
of
powers
is
extremely
important,
and
indeed,
i
would
rely
on
the
fact
that
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
case,
this
court
applied
tva
v.
hill
to
this
particular
statute,
saying
that
the
usual
concepts
of
separation
of
powers
are
too
important
to
turn
on
the...
what
a
court
may
think
is
equitable.
and
indeed,
it
stated
that
this
particular
statute
should
not
be
construed
in
general
terms
of
equity
jurisprudence
when
congress
has,
indeed,
addressed
and
resolved
the
question.
again,--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--well,
what
we're
trying
to
do
is...
indeed,
we
are
trying
to
do
nothing
more
than
what
the
statute
provides.
and
what
the
navy
is
attempting
to
do--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
and
i
will
say
that
it
does
that
in
the
substantive
prohibitions,
and
it
does--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
sir,
i
can.
section
301(a)
and
section
402,
and
section...
again,
the
requirement
that
as
construed
by
this
court
that
you
must
have
permit
prior
to
this.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
there...
injunctions
are
specified--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
not
in
those
substantive
sections,
no,
that
is
correct.
however,
your
honor,
we
rely
on
the
substantive
sections,
and
i
also
rely
on
the
fact
that
in...
that
this
congress
did
not
write
on
a
clean
slate
when
it
enacted
the
1972
statute.
it
took
away
a
provision
from
the
old
statute,
which
indeed
had
existed
since
1948,
that
allowed
for
the
formulation
of
decrees
by
the
court
on
the
basis
of
equity
and
other
factors.
that
was
gotten
rid
of
by
the
court
in...
by
the
congress
in
1972
and
in
its
place
it
substituted
an
elaborate
scheme...
extraordinary,
125
pages
in
the
committee
print...
of
exactly
how
congress
wanted
to
have
these
matters
handled.
and
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
thrust
of
this
act
is
to,
with
respect
to
having
a
permit,
is
categorical;
it
is
required
where
compliance
is,
indeed,
possible.
i'd
like
to
briefly
address
certain
questions,
if
i
can,
that
were
posed
by
the
navy
here.
the
fact
that
there
were
no
effluent
guidelines
does
not
make...
does
not
release
the
navy
from
having
to
have
a
permit.
section
402
says
that
prior
to
the
time
that
any
effluent
guidelines
or
other
provisions
may
have
been
enacted,
a
permit...
that
the
epa
could
put
in
any
provision
that
it
wishes
to
have.
furthermore,
the
facts...
the
navy
says
that
well,
they
feel
that
this
would
be
the
best
particular
accommodation,
that
they
think
is
necessary.
but
again,
this
court
has
said
not
what
is
appropriate,
but
what
did
congress
provide.
let
me
make
one
other
point.
the
navy
has
said
that
the
interests
of
puerto
rico
really
were
protected
by
the
district
court.
but
what
this
does
is
to
really
second-guess
the
entire
process.
it
second-guesses
the
administrative
process,
it
second-guesses
what
the
president
had
done.
and
with
respect
to
the
administrative
process,
the
administrative
process
that
the
epa
will
go
into
is
more
than...
well,
are
things
being
banged
up
out
there.
they
are
going
to
look
into
monitoring,
they
are
going
to
look
into...
which
the
navy
has
already
admitted
is
one
of
the
criteria
that
is
going
to
be
looked
into,
or
was
provided
in
this
particular
permit.
when
the
epa
looks
at
this,
it
will
cover
other
things
like
what
kind
of
limitations,
when,
where,
how,
and
a
number
of
things
that
a
district
court
simply
does
not
look
at.
and
therefore,
the
interests
of
the
particular
state
are,
indeed,
not
protected
by
what
the
district
court,
this
district
court,
did
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
i
think
that,
again,
the
thrust
of
tva
v.
hill
was
to
say
what
did
congress
provide.
and
it
is
the
job
of
the
courts
to
do
what
congress
provided
when
it's
addressed
the
problem
and
it
has
resolved
it.
and
really,
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
that
particular
case.
it's
a
recognition
of
the
proper
roles
of
the
three
functions...
proper
roles
of
the
three
branches
of
government.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
that
a
traditional
balancing
of
equities
would
be
improper,
and
that
a
court
should
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case,
which
is
to
take
a
look
at
the
statute,
the
statutory
purposes,
and
look
at
this
with
the
statutory
purposes
clearly
in
mind
and
with
an
acute
sense
of
what
congress
driving
at
in
this
statute,
and
then
proceed
to
act.
there
is,
certainly--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
that
is
correct.
but
in
the
context
of
this
case,
to
decline
to
act,
to
enforce,
a
clear
directive
of
how
congress
said
it
wanted
to
have
something
done,
when
it
really
has
addressed
the
question,
would
we
think
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
under
these
circumstances,
we
feel
that
the
unanimous
court
of
appeals--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
there
may
be
other
cases,
but
this
case,
what
the
district
court
did
did
not
facilitate
the
compliance,
because
what
it
said
was
i
am
making
a
determination...
or
what
it
did
was
to
make
a
determination
that
was
to
be
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
clear
contravention
of
what
this
particular
statute
said.
under
these
circumstances,
and
since
there
is
a
direct
requirement
that
there
be
a
permit
prior
to
discharges,
we
would
say
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
take
a
look
at
this
particular
statute
to
find
out
how
that
has
been
dealt,
with.
i--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
i
would
think
that
the
thrust
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
that
the
law...
that
a
court
should
carry
out
what
the
law
provides.
when
enforcement
is
sought--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--when
enforcement
is
sought
and
liability
is
found
and
a
continuing
violation
takes
place.
and
if
it's
physically
possible
to
stop,
then
we
would
say
that--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--yes,
your
honor,
that
would--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
considered
to
be
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant.
mr.
john
a.
hodges
your
honor,
under...
there
are
many
instances
where
the
epa--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
a
ship,
indeed,
will
be
considered
to
be
a...
defined
to
be
a
pollutant
in
this
regard.
certainly,
if
there
are
problems
with
this
particular
statute
and
certainly,
this
congress
has
kept
its
hands
on
the
statute.
i
think
the
very
length
of
the
statute
and
the
extraordinary
detail
which
the
statute
has
gone
into,
and
indeed,
the
fact
that
the...
that
congress
enacted
very
substantial
amendments
in
1977
has
shown
that
it
can
deal
with
this
question
when
it
wants
to.
it
wants
to
keep
its
hands
on;
it
does
not
want
to
have
this
particular
statute
unraveled
through
the...
through
district
courts
not
doing
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
under
the
statute.
your
honor,
in
closing,
we
would
say
that
we
feel
in
this
particular
case,
the
statute
is
clear,
the
navy
has
violated
it,
it
continues
to
violate
it.
compliance
is
physically
possible.
the
district
court
made
a
determination
of
the
kind
that
should
have
been
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
dealing
with
this
particular
violation
here,
not
any
other
violations
of
this
particular
act,
felt
that
the
navy's...
that
that
particular
discharge
should
be
halted
until
the
act
was
complied
with.
the
only
final
thing
that
i
would
say
is
that
we
would
urge
this
court
to
reach
its
determination
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
facts
before
it.
this
does
not
deal
with
every
violation
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
the
congress--
mr.
john
a.
hodges
--thank
you,
your
honor.
