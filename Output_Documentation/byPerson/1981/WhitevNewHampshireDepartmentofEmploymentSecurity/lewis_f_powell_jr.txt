justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
use
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
substantive
controversy
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue
that
prompted
us
to
take
the
case.
before
trial,
the
parties
reached
a
settlement
agreement
favorable
to
the
petitioner,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
below,
but
the
agreement
made
no
mention
of
attorney's
fees.
four
months
after
the
district
court
had
approved
the
settlement,
the
petitioner
as
a
party,
primarily
prevailing
filed
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees.
although
the
respondent
argued
that
the
settlement
agreement
had
implicitly
waived
any
such
right
the
district
court
awarded
fees.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
relying
on
rule
59(e)
or
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
it
held
that
the
request
for
fees
was
a
motion
to
amend
the
final
judgment
which
must
be
made
within
10
days
of
its
entry.
as
petitioner
had
not
filed
within
this
period,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
request
was
time
barred.
rule
59(e)
was
adopted
to
permit
district
courts
to
correct
errors
in
their
decisions
promptly
within
a
10-day
period.
request
for
attorney's
fees
are
not
applied
of
the
substantive
decision
of
a
lawsuit.
on
the
contrary,
they
may
be
awarded
under
the
fees
act
only
to
the
prevailing
party
and
this
cannot
be
determined
until
a
decision
on
the
merits
has
been
made.
even
though
rule
59(e)
does
not
apply,
district
courts
have
discretion
to
set
their
own
time
limits
either
by
a
general
rule
or
in
the
particular
case.
no
such
limit
has
been
set
in
this
case.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
