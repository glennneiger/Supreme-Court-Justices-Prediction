mr.
marc
r.
scheer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
to
start
out,
it
is
important
to
focus
in
on
what
is
really
an
issue
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
a
really
very
narrow
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
issue
is
what
remedies
are
available
to
a
successful
civil
rights
litigant
if
he
is
not
asked
for
attorney's
fees
at
a
time
prior
to
judgment.
in
those
cases
where
the
civil
rights
litigant
has
properly
requested
attorney's
fees
in
his
pleadings,
or
in
a
motion
prior
to
entry
of
judgment,
that
request
is
preserved
and
can
be
addressed
by
the
court.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
i
believe
that
congress
provided
that
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
of
1976
would
apply
to
cases
pending
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
under
rule
15
they
have
liberal
rights
to
amend.
they
could
have
filed
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees
at
any
time
prior
to
entry
of
the
judgment.
in
this
case,--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--that
is
correct,
because
it
would
not
be
a
final
judgment,
your
honor.
because
the
if
fees
issue
has
not
been
addressed
by
the
district
court,
that
judgment
would
not
be
final.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is,
unless
the
district
court
perhaps
decided
to
certify
under
rule
54(b)
i
think
it
is
that
there
are
other
important
issues
that
desire
a
review
on
appeal.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
i
believe
that
he
could,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
point
is
that
the
application
of
rule
59(e)
gives
the
prevailing
civil
rights
litigant
a
second
shot
to
get
attorney's
fees
after
there
has
been
judgment
on
the
underlying
cause
of
action,
where
the
prevailing
plaintiff
has
not
yet
made
a
request
for
attorney's
fees.
rule
59(e)
gives
the
prevailing
litigant
an
additional
ten
days
to
make
that
request.
under
the
federal
appellate
rules,
number
4,
that
will
suspend
the
time
of
the
running
of
the
appeal
until
the
decision
on
the
fees
issue
is
made.
once
that
is
made,
the
entire--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--all
he
need
file
is
a
motion
to
amend
the
judgment.
that
is
all
that
rule
59(e)
requires.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
i
think
that
would
be
enough.
i
think
the
whole
point
is
that--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--well
presumably,
the
judge
could
treat
it
as
though
it
was
filed
under
rule
59(e).
the
purpose
of
rule
59(e)
is
to
promote
expeditious
resolution
of
matters
before
the
court.
the
court
would
presumably
schedule
a
hearing
on
the
fees
issue
if
the
issue
were
contested,
and
presumably,
the
court
could
schedule
that
hearing
fairly
expeditiously.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
the
ten
days,
under
rule
59(e)
refers
to
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
under
rule
4
of
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
okay,
what--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--no,
sir.
the
ten-day
rule
relates
to
the
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment
that
has
previously
been
entered.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
correct.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
if...
what
happens
is,
if
there
is
an
appeal
pending
at
the
time
the
rule
59(e)
motion
to
amend
the
judgment
is
filed,
that
time
for
appeal
will
be
suspended,
pending
the
court's
ruling
on
the
59(e)
motion.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
if
there
is
no
appeal
pending,
if
the
prevailing
party
has
not
filed
a
fee
request
within
the
ten
days
allowed
by
rule
59(e),
he
is
barred
from
again
seeking
the
fees.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
within
the
ten-day
period?
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
yes,
sir.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
then
the
court
would
presumably
schedule
a
hearing--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--in
the
white
case,
your
honor,
although
the
motion
was
not
filed...
in
this
case,
although
the
motion
was
not
filed
within
ten
days;
it
was
filed
four
and
a
half
months
later,
the
court
did
schedule
a
hearing
because
the
fees
issue
was
contested.
if
the
issue
is
contested,
the
court
will
schedule
a
hearing.
in
fact,
the
court
almost
always
generally
schedules
a
hearing
on
an
attorney's
fees
award
issue
because
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee
must
be
determined
by
the
court
through
the
application
of
various
criteria
to
determine
if
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
under
rule
54(d),
routine
costs
can
be
covered
at
about...
at
any
time.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
time
limit
on
it.
i
would
agree
with
counselor
larson
that
as
to
those
costs,
a
rule
of
reason
should
be
applied.
i
mean,
the
parties
should
not
wait
for
an
unusually
long
period
of
time
in
which
to
file
it.
but
the
reason
for
that
rule
is
because
costs
are
items
that
are
routinely
taxed;
they
generally
do
not
involve
any
major
controversy,
and
as
the
statute
provides,
the
clerk
of
the
court
may
tax
the
costs.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
there
can.
but
there,
however,
still
a
significant
difference
between
a
cost,
a
routine
cost,
and
an
attorney's
fees
award
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
the
attorney's
fees
award
can
lead
to
substantial
additional
liability
on
behalf
of
the
losing
party.
in
this
case,
at
the
district
court
level
the
attorney's
fees
award
was
roughly
an
amount
of
$16,000.
that
is
an
amount
of
money
that
must
be
paid
directly
by
the
defendant.
he's
got
to
pay
it
out
of
his
own
pocket.
it
is
an
additional
liability
that
he
does
not
have.
so,
since
there
is--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--that
is
correct.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
in
the
case,
solely
in
the
case
where
the
attorney's
fees
issue
has
not
been
awarded
prior
to
entry
of
judgment,
it
seeks
to
impose
a
new,
unanticipated
liability
on
the
defendant.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
if
the
issue
is
not
framed
in
the
pleadings,
and
if
it
is
not
raised
prior
to
entry
of
judgment,
if
it
is
not
before
the
court,
if
the
parties
have
not
resolved
it,
the
issue
is
not
in
the
case.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
litigant
has
never
asked
for
the
fees
prior
to
entry
of
final
judgment.
if
the
final
judgment
is,
presumably,
final,
it
terminates
the
litigation;
it
fixes
the
obligations
of
the
parties.
and
if
four
months
later
counsel
for...
if
four
months
later
the
prevailing
party
can
come
in
and
say
by
the
way,
we
would
like
to
have
our
attorney's
fees,
that
is
a
significant
new
liability
for
the
losing
defendant,
or
the
losing
party.
the
losing
party
has
a
right
to
expect
that
the
prior
judgment
that
was
entered
without
reference
to
attorney's
fees,
fixed
his
liability
and
that
the
case
was
over.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
but,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
this
case
indicates
that,
for
example,
in
the
settlement
context
the
defendant
may
come
to
believe,
after
discussions
with
other
counsel,
that
there
would
be
no
request
for
costs.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
nothing
specifically,
justice
o'connor,
but
there
is
language
i
believe
in
the
senate
report
that
indicates
that
in
passing
the
act,
the
congress
intended
to
bring
the
remedy
under
1983
actions
in
line
with
the
remedies
that
were
available
under
other
civil
rights
actions,
and
the
language
of
the
senate
report
also
indicated
that
it
did
not
intend
to
create
any
startling
new
remedies.
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
were
to
construe
a
free
as
a
cost,
and
thereby
allow
the
fee
award
to
be
asserted
adversely
any
time
after
entry
of
final
judgment,
that
would
indeed
be
a
startling
new
remedy
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
when
it
enacted
the
attorney's
fees
award
act
of
1976.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
correct,
but
there
are
basically
two
bases
for
our
position.
one
is
that
indeed,
fees
are
substantially
different
from
costs.
and
congress,
by
using
the
language
it
did
in
the
statute,
did
not
intend
to
define
fees
as
costs.
you
must
look
at
the
entire
language
of
the
statutory
at
the
discretionary
aspect
of
the
court
award
of
attorney's
fees.
the
other
basis
of
our
argument
is
that
a
fee
award,
under
42
usc
1988,
is
intimately
tied
to
the
merits
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action;
that
it
is
not
a
collateral
and
independent
matter,
as
suggested
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
in
support
of
that
contention,
he
cites
certain
cases
that
deal
with
what
is
known
as
the
common
fund
doctrine.
in
those
cases,
courts
have
held
that
when
a
common
fund
is
identified,
the
prevailing
plaintiff,
the
successful
plaintiff,
can
receive
an
attorney's
fee
award
out
of
the
common
fund.
those
cases,
however,
do
not
bear
on
this
case.
in
the
common
fund
cases,
once
the
fund
is
identified,
the
losing
party
no
longer
has
any
interest
in
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
out
of
the
fund.
the
award
of
those
fees
is
intended
to
spread,
to
distribute
the
fees
among
the
class
of
benefited,
by
the
efforts
of
the
successful
party.
in
this
case,
quite
to
the
contrary,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
attorney's
fee
award
is
directly
against
the
losing
party.
he
obviously
has
a
direct
compelling
interest
in
the
amount
of
the
fee
award
because
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay
it
out
of
his
own
pocket.
so
those
essentially
are
our
two
main
arguments
with
respect
to
why
rule
54(d)
cannot
be
applied
to
this
situation.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
i
am
not
familiar
with
those
statutes,
your
honor,
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
fact
that
there
are
several
statutes.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
to
this
court
filed
in
april
said
that
there
were
around
16
statutes
which
have
been
passed
by
congress
relating
to
the
attorney's
fees
issue.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
additional
issue
we
would
like
to
address
is
an
issue
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
and
that
is
the
applicability
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
54(c)
to
this
case.
this
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
courts
below,
and
the
parties
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
brief
it.
if
the
court
desires,
i
would
be
happy
to
state
our
position
with
respect
to
rule
54(c).
rule
54(c)
relates
to
the
power
of
the
trial
court
to
include
in
a
judgment
all
remedies
to
which
a
party,
a
prevailing
party
would
be
entitled.
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
rule
54(c)
is
a
directive
to
the
court
before
entry
of
final
judgment.
rule
54(c)
cannot
be
raised
at
a
time
after
the
final
judgment
is
entered.
therefore,
rule
54(c)
cannot
have
an
application
to
this
case.
as
we
say,
anytime
that
an
alteration
in
the
final
judgment
is
requested,
it
must
be
done
pursuant
to
the
directive
of
federal
rule
of
procedure
59(e),
within
ten
days
after
entry
of
the
judgment.
i
also
desire
to
inform
the
court
of
a
recent
decision
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
dated
november
20,
1981.
i
wish
to
inform
the
court
that
although
it
deals
with
an
issue
similar
to
this
issue,
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
not
totally
adopted
the
position
that
the
respondents
have
taken
in
this
case.
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
in
ruling
on
a
fees
request
made
approximately
two
months
after
entry
of
final
judgment,
allowed
the
prevailing
plaintiffs
to
assert
the
attorney's
fees.
however,
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
did
notice
in
its
decision...
and
incidentally,
the
name
of
the
case
is
royer
v.
benjamin
adams,
commissioner
of
new
hampshire,
department
of
employment
security.
it
will
be
reported
in
121
new
hampshire.
the
date,
again,
is
november
20,
1981.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
not
yet,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
and
that
is
the
point,
your
honor.
i
feel
an
obligation
to
tell
the
court
about
this
case,
and
this
case
is
also
distinguishable
from
the
white
case
which
is
now
under
consideration.
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
noted
that
mr.
royer
in
his
original
pleadings
requested
fees,
and
that
preserved,
under
our
analysis
of
59(e),
that
fee
request
would
still
be
appropriate
two
months
after
entry
of
judgment,
because
the
judgment
was
not
final
as
the
fees
issue
had
not
been
decided.
and
as
you
indicate,
justice
rehnquist,
new
hampshire
supreme
court
did
specifically
say
that
there
is
no
state
law
on
point,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
definitive
directive,
it
would
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
rule
of
reason
and
decided
that
applying
for
fees
two
months
after
entry
of
judgment
was
reasonable
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
finally,
the
application
of
rule
59(e)
to
judgments
in
a
case
of
this
type
has
practical
and
desirable
results.
as
noted
before,
there
have
been
many
different
positions
that
have
been
taken
with
respect
to
the
timeliness
of
a
request
for
attorney's
fees
after
final
judgment
is
entered.
it
is
desirable,
and
it
is
practical,
to
have
a
uniform
rule
which
will
require
that
attorney's
fees
requests
be
made
no
later
than
ten
days
after
entry
of
the
final
judgment.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
essentially,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
if
he
files
the
motion
with
ten
days,
he
has
preserved
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that's
right.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is
correct,
they
did.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
we
did,
because
there
is
a
final
judgment.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
the
fees
weren't
requested,
and
that
is
the
point.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
but
it
was
a
proper
appeal.
and
then
the
case
was
remanded,
the
judgment
was
opened
for
the
entry
of
the
consent
decree,
and
then
this
case
arose
after
that.
rule
59(e)
promotes
several
important
policy
considerations.
it
promotes
the
policy
of
finality
of
judgments.
it
allows
people
to
have
an
expectation,
a
legitimate
expectation,
that
a
final
judgment
entered
by
the
court
will
adjudicate
all
the
issues
that
have
been
framed
in
front
of
the
proceeding
in
the
trial
court.
and
the
application
of
rule
59(e)
also
promotes
fairness
to
all
of
the
parties.
the
parties
will
know
that
after
a
period
of
ten
days
has
run
after
final
judgment,
if
no
fee
has
been
requested,
the
issue
is
foreclosed.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
are
you
referring,
justice
marshall--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--the
joint
appendix
relates
that
the
defendants
considered
that
the
fees
issue
had
been
waived
during
settlement
negotiations.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
there
was
a
discussion
of
it.

that
is
correct,
but
the
defense
counsel
is
under
the
impression...
i
wasn't
defense
counsel,
justice
marshall,
but
the
defense
counsel
was
under
the
impression
that
fees
had
been
waived
in
the
settlement
context.
mr.
marc
r.

it
was
after
the
fees
motion
was
filed,
that
is
correct.
the
petitioners
said
that--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--we
were
aware
that
they
had
it
in
mind,
but
our
knowledge
was,
our
counsel's
knowledge
was,
that
they
had
been
waived.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
that
is
correct.
it
was.
but
since
the
consent
decree
embodied
the
agreement
of
the
parties--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--i
would
say
no
because
it
had
been
discussed.
but
surprised
based
on
the
fact
that
we
thought
that
they
had
waived
the
fee
request;
that
they
were
not
going
to
bring
it
up.
surprised
to
that
extent.
rule
59(e)
contrasts
with
the
practical
problems
that
would
arise
from
the
approach
suggested
by
the
petitioners.
there
would
be
no
uniform
rule
relating
to
the
request
of
attorney's
fees
in
civil
rights
cases.
the
parties'
expectations
after
settlement
or
after
entry
of
final
judgement
could
never
be
sure.
the
judgment
could
theoretically...
the
party
could
theoretically
be
exposed
to
significant
new
liability
for
long
periods
of
time
after
entry
of
final
judgment.
the
rule
of
reason
in
these
cases
really
does
not
help
losing
parties
because
they
will
never
know,
theoretically,
when
their
final
liability
is
going
to
be
foreclosed.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
relates
to
the
first
circuit's
language
relating
to
the
discussion
of
attorney's
fees
in
the
settlement
context.
the
first
circuit
decision
does
not,
does
not,
require
the
parties
to
simultaneously
negotiate
the
issue
of
attorney's
fees
and
the
merits
of
the
action
in
a
settlement
context.
all
the
first
circuit
decision
does
is
say
face
up
to
the
issue;
the
parties
should
consider
the
issue.
the
first
circuit
in
fact
touches
on
a
potential
unfairness,
a
basic
unfairness,
to
the
liable
party
in
settlement
context.
and
that
is,
if
one
of
the
parties
has
an
intention
to
seek
attorney's
feels
and
if
it
has
not
previously
been
raised,
that
intention
should
be
disclosed
during
the
course
of
settlement
negotiations.
if
the
parties
are
unable
to
reach
an
agreement
on
attorney's
fees
after
an
agreement
on
the
merits
has
been
reached,
the
parties
may
preserve
the
issue
in
the
dissent
decree
by
specifically
reserving
it
for
later
court
consideration,
or
the
prevailing
party
may
petition
the
court
within
ten
days
after
entry
of
the
consent
decree.
this
procedure
provides
a
safety
valve
which
promotes
the
important
policy
of
encouraging
settlement
of
litigation
and
it
also
provides
a
mechanism
whereby
the
attorney's
fees
issues,
if
it
cannot
be
settled,
can
be
reserved
for
consideration
at
a
later
date.
i
have
no
further
argument.
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
questions.
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
as
part
of
the
costs?
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
the
meaning
that
we
give
to
it
is,
as
part
of
the
costs,
the
expenses,
of
litigation.
we
don't--
mr.
marc
r.
scheer
--correct.
thank
you.
