unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
is
there
any
recognized
time
limit
for
the
filing
of
a
bill
of
costs
as
such
after
the
prevailing
party
has
gotten
his
judgment
in
a
lawsuit
and
it
has
been
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
provision
in
one
of
the
rule
54...
either
54
or
56...
that
the
entry
of
judgment
shall
not
he
delayed
because
of
entry
of
costs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
if
the
time
for
appeal
had
elapsed
and
no
appeal
were
taken,
do
you
think
that
thereafter,
any
application
for
costs
would
be
appropriate
under
rule
rule
54?
unknown
speaker
is
there
no
time
limit,
then,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
take--
unknown
speaker
--take
a
situation
where
the
costs
sought
to
be
taxed
are
traditional
costs,
costs
of
depositions,
filing
fee,
service
of
process,
that
sort
of
thing.
i've
been
away
from
private
practice
sufficiently
long
so
that
i
am
not
aware.
would
a
district
court
entertain
a
statement
of
costs
four
years
after
the
termination
of
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
no,
say
it
had
simply
terminated.
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
the
other
side
be
able
to
do
with
that?
would
they
object?
unknown
speaker
and
what
else
could
they
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
isn't
that
longstanding,
you
know,
it
has
only
been
on
the
books
a
few
years.
don't
you
think
it's
about
time
that
a
rule
was
established?
unknown
speaker
and
the
rule
of
reasonableness
is
how
long?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
rule
of
reasonableness
i
understand
can
extend
from
one
minute
to
36
years.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
maybe
i'm
different
reasonable
from
you.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
there
should
be
some
stability
to
it,
like
the
ten-day
rule
that
was
put
in
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
we
can,
if
congress
does
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
it's
costs
or
not.
the
question
that
justice
rehnquist
asked
you,
four
months
on
costs
due,
and
you
said
you
didn't
know.
if
it
was
on
appeal
or
something,
or
if
it
wasn't
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
but
then
the
problem...
what
is
it
here?
why
is
it
here?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
it's
here
because
we
wanted
to
look
into
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
mind
if
we
do,
please.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
that
isn't
quite
right.
all
they
have
to
do
is
reserve
the
issue
of
fees,
don't
they,
with
intend--
unknown
speaker
--the
judgment
says,
in
so
many
words,
the
question
of
fees
will
be
taken
up
in
six
months,
or--
unknown
speaker
--you
didn't
even
ask
for
them
in
your
pleadings,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
have
to
approve
boilerplates?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
rule
that
prevented
you
from
asking
for
them,
as
they
did
in
alyeska.
right?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
reserving
fees.
is
it
your
view
that
under
the
first
circuit
holding,
if
someone
gets
in
the
same
position
that
you
were
in,
five
days
after
judgment
the
plaintiff
went
in
and
said,
your
honor,
we
left
out
the
question
of
fees;
would
you
amend
the
judgment
and
add
a
clause
saying
the
issue
of
fees
shall
be
reserved
for
later
determination.
would
he
have
power
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
he
couldn't
amend
the
judgment
within
ten
day
in
that
way?
i
don't
understand
why
not.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
original
judgment
said
the
matters
of
fees
will
be
reserved
for
further
determination?
it
is
done
in
antitrust
cases
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
this
case
on
the
merits
went
off
on
a
consent
decree,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
in
a
consent
decree,
ordinarily
the
parties
taken
into
consideration
the
possibility
of
attorney's
fees
and
negotiate
for
them,
too,
so
that
when
the
consent
decree
is
finally
filed,
both
parties
figure
that
the
attorney's
fees
are
taken
care
of?
unknown
speaker
but
you
weren't
in
the
third
circuit.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
be
binding
on
the
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
the
second
circuit,
because
of
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york,
would
be
bound
to
follow
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
laron,
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
if
we
affirmed
the
first
circuit,
a
practical
effect
would
be
that
you
would
have
to
file
your
application
for
fees
within
ten
days.
and
not
only
that,
but
the
court
would
have
to
decide
the
application
within
ten
days?
unknown
speaker
if
we
affirm,
that
is
what
this
would
mean.
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
it
was
an
application
supported
by,
as
you
put
it
earlier,
an
inch
or
six
inches,
an
application
six
inches
thick?
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
your
reading
of
the
first
circuit
decision
is
that
both
the
application
would
have
to
be
made
and
the
decision
on
the
application
reached
by
the
court
within
ten
days.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
trying
to
get
your
reading
of
the
first
circuit
decision,
and
all
you're
telling
me
now
is
that
it
means
only
that
the
application
has
to
be
made
within
ten
days,
and
the
district
judge
may
sit
on
it
for
a
year.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
at
this
point,
mr.
larson,
are
you
resting
your
case
on
54(d)?
unknown
speaker
in
its
entirety?
would
you
be
content,
then,
to
have
attorney's
fees
taxed
by
the
clerk
on
one
day's
notice?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
not
resting
entirely
on
54(d).
unknown
speaker
could
i
have
your
comment,
now
that
i
have
you
interrupted,
to
the
eight
circuit's
opinion
in
obin?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
a
case
filed
before
this
statute?
did
they
have
to
ask
for
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
he
should
have
amended?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
he
does,
though,
have
it
in
his
complaint,
or
he
files
a
motion
and
then
there
is
judgment.
now,
the
ten-day
time
limit
would
never
apply
to
him,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
not
be
appealable
unless
he
certified
it
as
appealable?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
he
could
always
do
that,
and
still
save
the
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
may
i
interrupt?
what
is
your
view
of
what
he
should
file
within
the
ten-day
period?
should
he
file
a
fee
petition,
or
should
he
file
a
motion
to
amend
the
judgment
to
reserve
the
fee
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he
just
filed
a
fee
petition?
what
if
just
filed
a
document
that
said
motion
for
allowance
of
fees?
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
does
not
act
on
it
within
the
ten
days.
then
he
would
later
on
treat
it
as
though
it
were
filed
under
59(e)?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
when
there
was
an
appeal
involved.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
ten-day
involved
an
appeal.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
that
would
hold
up
the
appeal.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
appeal
involved
here.
unknown
speaker
so
how
does
the
ten-day
rule
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
i
understand
your.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
ten-day
was
restricted
to
where
there
was
an
appeal
involved.
unknown
speaker
prior
to
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
appeal
involved
here.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
is
no
appeal
pending,
what?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
had
filed
one?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen?
unknown
speaker
presumed?
can
you
give
me
a
case
that
says
it
happened?
excuse
me
your
honor?
you
said
presumed.
i
can't
work
on
presumed.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
frequently
a
judgment
will
say
the
plaintiff,
if
he
gets
the
monetary
judgment,
shall
recover
his
costs.
and
then
later
on
they
will
assess
the
costs;
sometimes
within
ten
days,
sometimes
not.
supposing
the
judgment
omitted
that
fairly
common
recital;
is
it
your
view
that
the
plaintiff
would
lose
his
right
to
recover
costs
if
he
didn't
ask
for
them
within
ten
days?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
of
the
time
limit
on
the
recovery
of
costs
when
the
judgment
makes
no
reference
to
costs?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
can
be
disputes
over
costs.
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
differentiated
from
the
judgment
itself,
if
you
have
money
involved?
the
defendant
always
pay
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
it
is
unanticipated?
unknown
speaker
it's
not...
the
amount
is
not
known.
unknown
speaker
but
reasonable
is...
of
course,
this
arose
in
a
transition
period.
but
do
you
suppose
there
really
will
be
very
many
cases
in
the
future
where
defendants,
state
organizations,
won't
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
somebody
is
going
to
ask
for
fees?
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
kind
of
theoretical.
the
statute
is
plain
on
its
face,
unless,
of
course,
you
have
the
ten-day
rule.
and
if
you
run
on
that,
then
they
will
just
have
to
be
more
diligent
in
their
pleadings.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
are
pretty
naive
defendants.
i've
been
in
a
lot
of
cases
where
there
are
fees
that
you
wait
on
until
later
on.
mr.
scheer,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
intended
the
fees
not
to
fall
under
rule
54
as
costs?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
argument
then
turns
almost
on
a
difference
that
attorney's
fees
as
costs
are
different
in
kind,
not
just
in
degree
from
the
fairmont
creamery
type
of
case
that
the
court
long
ago
held
was
not
barred
from
being
awarded
by
a
federal
court
under
the
11th
amendment
against
a
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scheer,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
you
were
faced
with
the
question
under
the
securities
act,
and
the
antitrust
act
and
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
and
the
communications
act
and
the
railway
labor
act,
where
also,
congress
has
referred
in
a
variety
of
ways
to
the
taxing
of
attorney's
fees
as
costs?
are
you
saying
that
in
none
of
those
instances
did
congress
mean
what
it
said;
that
they
would
be
taxed
as
costs?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
atlantic
cite?
unknown
speaker
new
hampshire
certainly
adopt
whatever
rule
it
wishes.
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather,
mr.
scheer,
all
that
the
prevailing
party
has
to
do,
do
i
understand
you
to
suggest,
is
simply
say
i
apply
for
fees,
period?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
he
has
to
do.
unknown
speaker
he
does
no
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scheer,
if
you
are
correct,
am
i
not
correct
in
believing
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
after
the
plaintiffs
first
won
in
this
case?
because
they
prevailed
at
the
first
trial,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
mention
of
fees
in
the
original
judgment,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
so
there
really
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals,
so
actually,
they
are
about
two
years
late,
not
just
four
months
late.
because
you
had
no
right
to
appeal,
i
take
it,
under
your
present
theory
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
you
had
no
right
in
1979
to
appeal
under
your
present
theory
of
the
case,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
there's
no
final
judgment
if
it
doesn't
dispose
of...
oh,
because
the
fees
were
not
requested.
i've
got
it.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what
significance
is
the
conversation
during
the
settlement
about
fees?
unknown
speaker
what's
in
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
there
was
an
argument
about
it
during
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
so
you
were
on
notice
then,
weren't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
disputed
in
court.
unknown
speaker
so
you
did
know
that
they
did
want
counsel
fees.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
first
decided
that
each
side
would
pay
its
own
counsel
fees?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
discussion
that
each
side
would
pay
its
own
fees,
and
that
was
discarded?
so
it
was
a
subject
of
discussion.
unknown
speaker
all
i
mean
is
you
weren't
so
surprised
when
they
did
ask
for
them
again,
were
you?
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
other
question.
you
may
have
already
completed
your
answer,
but
justice
o'connor
called
your
attention
to
a
number
of
statutes
that
make
reference
to
fees,
costs
including
fees,
or
fees
as
a
part
of
the
costs.
and
in
the
particular
statute
before
us,
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
would
the
statute
have
any
different
meaning
if
those
words
are
simply
stricken
from
the
act?
it
says
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
part
of
the
costs.
supposing
it
didn't
"say
as
part
of
the
costs.
"
do
you
give
any
meaning
at
all
to
those
words
in
your
analysis?
unknown
speaker
yes.
or
do
you
say
we
just
simply
ignore
it?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
would
have
the
same
meaning
if
the
words
were
simply
deleted.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
anything
short
of
a
stipulation,
casual
conversations
or
non-casual
conversations
takes
the
place
of
what
the
first
circuit
required?
unknown
speaker
mr.
scheer,
isn't
the
basic
purpose
of
a
consent
decree
to
resolve
in
favor
of
one
party
or
another
party
a
lot
of
disputed
issues,
of
which
each
party
has
notice.
and
some
may
be
resolved
in
favor
of
one,
some
in
favor
of
the
other.
but
the
consent
decree
is
a
package
which
presumably
brings
an
end
to
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
the
consent
decree
have
reserved
the
question
of
fees?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
answer,
mr.
larson,
mr.
scheer's
suggestion
that
they
had
reason
to
think
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
settlement,
fees
had
been
waived?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
helps
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
waived,
but
not
dealt
with
in
the
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
i'm
surprised
you
read
that
sentence
rather
than
the
one
you
omitted,
because
the
one
you
omitted
indicates
that
they
were
astounded
at
the
thought
that
you
would
waive
fees.
that
seems
to
me
a
lot
more
supportive
to
your
position
than
the
one
you
quoted.
unknown
speaker
but
not
reserved
in
the
decree;
it
simply
wasn't
settled
by
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
you
don't
see
anything
unethical,
do
you,
in
reserving
in
the
consent
decree
the
issue
of
attorney's
fees,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
or
in
a
settlement
agreement.
unknown
speaker
do
you
perceive
anything
unethical
in
the
agreement
or
consent
decree
if
the
parties
first
deal
with
the
merits
and
resolve
that
and
then
secondarily
deal
with
the
issue
of
the
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
but
presumably
you
could
do
it
in
a
bifurcated
fashion,
and
the
parties
could
still
contemplate
taking
care
of
all
potential
issues
in
any
settlement
or
consent
decree,
could
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
they're
thinking
ahead,
they
can
solve
these
problems
and
not
be
in
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
these
parties
found
themselves,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
will
you
help
me
out
on
new
hampshire?
i've
looked
at
both
judgments
here,
and
i
don't
see
costs
any
place.
is
there
a
separate
bill
of
costs
in
there?
a
separate
piece
of
paper?
unknown
speaker
on
page
41
of
the
appendix,
what
is
30?
that's
the
court
of
appeals,
right?
now,
where
is
the
district
court's
order?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
what
i
want.
i
didn't
see
any
costs
on
that
at
all.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there's
no
costs.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
is
the
judgment
that
gives
the
costs?
do
you
have
separate
costs?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
say
what
the
costs
are.
unknown
speaker
what's
confusing
me,
in
some
states
it
says
judgment
for
plaintiff,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
and
costs...
and
then
put
$30.80
or
$56.00.
unknown
speaker
are
there
no
costs
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
paid
for
the
filing
of
the
papers?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
side
had
no
expenses?
so
there's
no
costs
except
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
under
your
view,
of
the
case
does
it
matter
whether
the
parties
thought
that
their
litigation
was
at
an
end,
at
the
time
of
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
let's
suppose
a
judgment
was
obtained,
as
indeed
it
was
here,
but
both
parties
assumed
their
litigation
was
over.
unknown
speaker
now,
can
you
change
your
mind
later
and
come
back
and
ask
for
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
essentially
reserved,
it
certainly
wasn't
essentially
reserved
in
a
written
document,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
consent
decree.
