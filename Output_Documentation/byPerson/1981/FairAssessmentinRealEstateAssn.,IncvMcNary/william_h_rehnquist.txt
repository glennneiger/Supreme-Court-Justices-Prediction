justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
fair
assessment
in
real
estate,
the
petitioners
are
individual
taxpayers
in
st.
louis
county,
missouri
and
an
association
formed
by
taxpayers
to
promote
the
equitable
enforcement
of
missouri
property
tax
laws.
they
claimed
that
st.
louis
county
tax
officials
denied
them
the
equal
protection
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
taxing
new
property
at
higher
rates
and
older
property
and
retaliating
against
taxpayers
who
sought
administrative
adjustment
of
their
taxes
by
targeting
those
taxpayers
for
reassessment
the
following
year.
petitioners
asserted
their
claim
in
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
under
the
civil
rights
act
42
u.s.c.
1983
seeking
an
award
of
money
damages
for
these
alleged
violations
of
their
constitutional
rights.
before
suing
in
federal
court,
some
of
the
petitioners
had
successfully
sought
some
relief
in
missouri
courts
and
in
administrative
review
proceedings
which
missouri
provides.
the
district
court
dismissed
petitioners'
complaint
holding
that
federal
court
adjudication
of
state
tax
matters
is
barred
by
the
tax
injunction
act,
which
forbids
federal
courts
from
enjoining,
suspending
or
restraining
the
assessment,
levy
or
collection
of
taxes
and
by
the
principle
of
comity
between
state
and
federal
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
vote
because
we
decide
that
such
damages
actions
are
barred
by
the
principle
of
comity.
we
need
not
decide
whether
they
are
also
barred
by
the
tax
injunction
act.
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
before
enactment
of
the
tax
injunction
act
and
even
before
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
have
recognized
the
sensitive
nature
of
state
tax
systems
and
the
deference
they
should
be
accorded
in
federal
courts.
the
passage
of
the
tax
injunction
act
in
1937
did
not
restrict
this
recognized
comity
and
decisions
of
this
court
since
its
enactment
have
held
on
the
basis
of
comity
that
federal
courts
may
not
render
declaratory
judgments
as
to
the
validity
of
state
tax
laws.
because
we
conclude
the
petitioners’
damages
action
would
be
everybody’s
intrusive
in
the
missouri
tax
administration
as
with
the
declaratory
judgments
or
other
forms
of
equitable
relief
which
have
in
part
in
the
past
been
barred.
we
hold
the
damages
actions
brought
under
section
1983
to
redress
the
unconstitutional
enforcement
of
state
tax
laws
are
also
barred
by
the
principle
of
comity.
justice
brennan
joined
by
justice
marshall,
justice
stevens
and
justice
o’connor
have
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
