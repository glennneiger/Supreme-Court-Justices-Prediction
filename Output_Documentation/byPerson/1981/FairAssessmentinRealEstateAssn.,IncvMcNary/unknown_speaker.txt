unknown
speaker
mr
newburger,
is
there
any
issue
here
of
whether
your
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action
in
1983?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
whether
we
ought
not
get
that.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
whether,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
injunction
act
has
been
extended
to
declaratory
judgments,
it
should
also
be
extended
to
monetary
relief?
unknown
speaker
was
he
suggesting,
when
he
said
it
was
like
a
tax
refund
action,
that
that
in
any
event
would
be
the
limit
of
any
1983
damages?
a
refund
of
the
excess
tax?
unknown
speaker
including
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
including
punitive?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
certainly
the
thrust
of
great
lakes
versus
huffman,
wasn't
it,
that
just
because
it
said
injunction
didn't
mean
that
it
was
limited
to
injunction.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
newburger,
before
we
ever
had
1341,
i
gather
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
was,
at
the
very
least,
wasn't
it,
that
you
had
to
do
administrative
exhaustion,
administrative
exhaustion
in
the
state,
and
that
that
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
a
tax
suit,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
was
weld
county,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
think
that
1341
in
any
way
affected
that
jurisdictional
requirement?
unknown
speaker
so
that
left
standing,
weld
county
would
still
be
good
law,
notwithstanding
1341.
unknown
speaker
at
21
of
your
brief,
you
cite
matthews
and
rodgers.
unknown
speaker
and
the
conclusion
of
the
quotation
you
cite
from
suggests
that
a
suit
at
law
in
the
federal
courts,
if
the
essential
elements
of
federal
jurisdiction
are
present.
now,
didn't
that
at
least
contemplate
that
you
had
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies,
as
a
federal
jurisdictional
prerequisite,
before
you
could
maintain
a
suit
at
law
in
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
did
you
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies
in
this--
unknown
speaker
--no,
my
question
was,
did
you.
did
you
attempt
to
exhaust--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
an
administrative
appeal,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
it
does--
unknown
speaker
--even
it
it
can,
if
you
could
have
brought
your
suit
in
state
court
under
1983,
you
say
that
is
no
answer
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
you
may
still
go
into
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
they
are
state
officials?
unknown
speaker
they
are
state
officials?
unknown
speaker
and
to
sue
state
and
county
officials
does
not
interfere
with
their
work.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
sued
the
county
or
any
municipality
as
such,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
is
no
owen
and
independence
problem
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
newburger,
may
i
interrupt
you?
the
references
to
bad
faith
in
this
context
are
somewhat...
a
little
bit
unusual,
it
seems
to
me.
supposing
there
was
a
statute
in
the
state
that
said
new
homes
shall
be
assessed
at
33
percent
of
market
value,
and
after
a
year
they
shall
be
assessed
at
20
percent
of
market
value.
is
it
your
view
that
that
statute
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
we
know.
all
we
know
is
that
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that,
and
then
the
people
who
work
in
the
tax
department
are
trying
to
collect
taxes
on
that
basis.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
statute
had
a
preamble
reciting
that
the
additional
expense
in
connection
with
new
construction,
building
permits,
inspections,
and
so
forth,
justified
this?
would
you
have
any
problem
with
it
then?
there
are
additional
expenses
for
new
homes,
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
and
building
inspections.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
we
are
talking
about
the
federal
constitution,
does
it
really
matter
to
us
whether
the
classification
is
made
by
the
legislature
or
by
the
people
who
collect
the
taxes,
if
they
do
it
on
a
uniform
basis
and
make
the
particular
rule?
unknown
speaker
but
this
one
by
your
own
allegation
is
not
a
happenstance
or
an
accident.
they
have
a
state
policy
of
treating
new
homes
at
one
rate
and
older
homes
at
a
different
rate,
and
it
seems
you
have
conceded
that
it
is
not
palpably
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
a
statute,
you
conceded
it,
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
last
time
anybody
cited
sioux
city?
i
haven't
read
it,
to
be
honest
with
you.
unknown
speaker
was
there
an
answer
in
this
case,
or
just
a
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
my
ultimate
question.
was
immunity
pleaded
in
any
of
the
answers?
unknown
speaker
because
i
thought
our
qualified
immunity
rule
under...
and
i
think
it
was
in
procuniae
against
naverett
out
of
illinois,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
not.
i
am
thinking
of
the
qualified
immunity
case.
unless
the
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
he
is
immune.
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
several
times
said
that
unless
the
law
was
clearly
established,
especially
on
a
constitutional
basis,
he
shouldn't
be
held
liable
to
damages.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
just
wonder
why
in
this
case,
if
you
are
going
to
have
to
prove...
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
equal
protection
violation,
i
would
think
the
immunity
defense
is
going
to
be
fairly
solid.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
should
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
not
going
to
have
to
prove
it
then,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
any
cases
that
come
right
out
and
hold
that
this
differential
in
assessment
violates
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
the
missouri
administrative
appeal
system
gives
you
no
relief,
says
it
is
not,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
appealed
it.
you
appealed
it
in
a
couple
of
the
years,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
presented
the
constitutional
question
to
any
illinois
authorities?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
missouri.
unknown
speaker
is
the
equal
protection
question
pending
in
the
missouri
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
newburger,
i
saw
your
light
go
on.
i
just
wanted
to
ask
one
more
question.
unknown
speaker
if
we
can
get
back
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
namely,
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
to
entertain
a
1983
action
in
cases
like
this.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
this
quotation
from
rosewell?
you
just
mentioned
rosewell.
unknown
speaker
page
21,
in
which
we
said,
"it
is
true
that
post-1937
court
cases
have
suggested
that
the
tax
injunction
act
recognized
and
sanctioned
the
pre-existing
federal
equity
practice.
"
and
we
said
that
"it
was
a
long-standing
rule
of
federal
equity
to
keep
out
of
state
tax
matters
as
long
as
a
plain,
adequate,
and
complete
remedy
could
be
had
at
law.
"
does
that
bear
at
all
on
our
question
here?
unknown
speaker
so
we
assume
that
there
is
one.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
the
missouri
supreme
court
were
to
say,
yes
you
may
maintain
a
1983
action
in
our
state
court
for
the
damages
that
you
are
seeking
in
the
federal
courts.
would
that
have
any
relation
to
this?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
monroe
and
pape
argument,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
monroe
and
pape
argument.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wehrle,
the
statute,
of
course,
in
words,
deals
only
with
enjoining,
suspending,
or
restraining,
doesn't
it?
and
here
what
you
have
is
an
action
for
money
damages.
is
that
an
action
to
suspend
or
enjoin
or
restrain?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
declaratory
judgment
and
damages.
unknown
speaker
so
the
declaratory
judgment
case
does
not
help
you
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only
difference
between
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
is
one
piece
of
paper.
that
is
the
only
difference,
right?
unknown
speaker
what
else
do
you
need
after
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
all
you
need
is
a
motion
to
turn
it
into
a
permanent
injunction.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
little
difference
between
that
and
damages,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
can
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
it
help
you
on
damages?
unknown
speaker
but
they
limited
it
to
injunctions.
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
said,
the
federal
courts
shall
take
no
action
on
state
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not.
they
limited
it
to
injunctions.
unknown
speaker
so
eventually
we
will
extend
it
to
probate.
unknown
speaker
can
declaratory
judgments
become
a
predicate
for
money
damage
judgments?
unknown
speaker
not
only
that,
to
get
damages
you
certainly
are
going
to
have
to
have
a
judgment
that
this
assessment
system
is
illegal.
unknown
speaker
may
i
disagree
that
you
don't
need
a
declaratory
judgment
to
recover
actions
on
a
case
that
asks
for
damages.
you
can
get
damages
without
a
declaratory
judgment,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
when
you
sue
for
damages,
can't
you
get
it
without
a
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
can't
you?
i
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to
give
back
a
whole
lot
of
judgments
i
have
delivered.
you
can't
get
damages
without
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
said
declaratory--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
is
what
you
also
said,
declaratory.
i
said
judgment.
well,
take
declaratory
out.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
the
tax
injunction
act.
in
your
argument
you
don't
need
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
urge
it.
the
court
just
took
it.
unknown
speaker
it
was?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
on
comity.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
be
satisfied
with
comity,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
refund
remedy,
is
there,
under
missouri
practice?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
that
you
have
to
pay
your
tax?
unknown
speaker
does
that
commission
have
the
authority
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
classification
is--
unknown
speaker
--if
instead
of
this
being
a
discrimination
between
new
homeowners
and
old
homeowners,
if
the
discrimination
was
based
on,
say,
racial
classification
or
national
origin
or
something
like
that,
and
there
was
an
allegation
that
all
the
persons
of
a
given
race
were
assessed
at
a
different
basis,
and
that
was
state
policy
and
so
forth,
you
would
still
say
that
claim
had
to
be
asserted
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
the
principle
of
taxing
at
different
rates
because,
in
this
case,
they
are
new
homeowners
as
opposed
to
old,
or
in
the
other
case
because
they
are
members
of
race
a
instead
of
race
b,
that
that
principle
is
either
right
or
wrong.
you
couldn't
raise
that
issue
at
all
in
a
federal
court
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wehrle,
you
have
relied
primarily
on
the
tax
injunction
act,
1341--
unknown
speaker
--as
barring
this
1983
suit
for
damages.
unknown
speaker
have
you
any
other
ground
for
barring
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
is
that
jurisdictional,
comity?
unknown
speaker
is
comity
jurisdictional?
unknown
speaker
pre-1341--
unknown
speaker
--there
was
a
federal
principle
to
stay
out
of
state
tax
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
equity.
unknown
speaker
that
was
equity,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
would
be
willing
to
win
this
case
on
either
ground.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
the
eighth
circuit
found
it
so
difficult
and
divided
equally?
unknown
speaker
but
they
expressed,
and
i
think
it
is
very
unusual,
they
expressed
their
division.
unknown
speaker
and
did
not
hide
it
behind
a
general
statement
of
an
equally
divided
court.
unknown
speaker
was
monroe
and
pape
argued
in
the
eighth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
was
monroe
and
pape
argued
in
the
eighth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wehrle,
i
will
ask
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
do
i
correctly
assume
that
in
your
view,
anyway,
your
opposition
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
state
remedy
is
inadequate
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
do
they
agree
with
you
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
should
ask
them,
but
i
wanted
to
get
your
impression.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wehrle--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
agree
that
congress
simply
wasn't
thinking
of
a
damages
suit
under
section
1983
when
it
enacted
the
tax
injunction
act?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
mr.
wehrle,
about
what
the
federal
courts
have
done.
in
their
reply
brief...
i
haven't
read
the
cases,
but
your
opponent
on
page
16
cites
some
cases
in
which
he
says,
in
diversity
cases
the
federal
courts
had
rendered
damage
awards
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
that
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
were
damage...
there
was
federal
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
damage
judgment,
even
if
it
was
applying
state
law.
we
do
not
have
an
issue
about
what
kind
of
law.
unknown
speaker
and
the
objection
in
the
tax
injunction
act
was
to
enjoin
even
in
diversity
cases
applying
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
they
limited
the
statute
to
the
injunction
remedy,
because
they
were
concerned
about
the
federal
courts
interpreting
the
state
law
and
giving
that
remedy.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
questioning
your
analysis
of
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
is
all,
and
apparently
there
were
precedents
at
that
time--
unknown
speaker
--for
federal
courts
both
enjoining
and
granting
monetary
relief--
unknown
speaker
--and
congress
clearly
foreclosed
further
injunctive
relief,
but
did
not,
at
least
not
as
clearly,
foreclose--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question
of
mine,
mr.
wehrle,
you
take
the
position
that
the
tax
injunction
act
barred
not
only
injunction
suits
but
also,
and
the
congress
intended
also
to
bar--
unknown
speaker
--by
the
tax
injunction
act
damage
suits,
don't
you?
isn't
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
neither
were
the
injunction
cases
that
had
been
previously
decided.
they
were
also
based
on
state
law.
unknown
speaker
some
of
them
were.
some
of
them.
the
major
difficulty
that
congress
was
concerned
with
was
foreign
corporations
coming
in
having
the
advantage
of
diversity
jurisdiction
and
getting
injunctive
relief
under
state
law.
they
didn't
want
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
people
are
in
federal
court,
too.
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
is
put
in
in
behalf
of
the
defendants
to
explain
the
reason,
if
there
is
one,
for
the
classification
that
they
challenge,
that
is,
the
distinction
between
new
homes
and
older
homes?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
this
does
not
apply
to
taxes
within
the
city
of
st.
louis,
this
case.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
agree,
though,
that
in
the
course
of
your
litigation,
to
succeed
you
are
going
to
have
to
prove
that
the
assessment
was
illegal,
that
it
violated
the
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
and
have
a
judgment
of
the
court
that
it
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
