mr.
david
j.
newburger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1974,
david
and
lynn
cassilly
bought
a
new
home
in
st.
louis
county,
missouri.
in
1975,
they
with
other
citizens
of
st.
louis
county
initiated
a
series
of
litigations
in
the
state
court
system
to
attempt
to
obtain
a
reassessment
of
real
property
taxes
in
st.
louis
county
and
in
the
state
of
missouri.
a
series
of
decisions
by
the
state
courts
have
been
rendered
on
that
subject
and
a
process
of
reassessment
is
now
under
legislative
and
court
mandate
going
forward
in
the
state
of
missouri.
in
the
middle
of
the
process
of
raising
the
issue
of
reassessment
in
the
state
of
missouri,
the
cassillys,
together
with
a
citizen
organization
in
which
they
were
involved,
initiated
this
action,
a
1983
action,
in
which
they
sought
damages
against
certain
state
and
county
officials
for
what
they
viewed
as
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights.
particularly,
they
alleged
two
violations
of
rights.
first,
they
alleged
that
they
had
been
placed
in
a
category
of
classification
of
homeowners
that
was
separate
from
homeowners
in
general,
that
is,
new
homeowners,
and
that
as
new
homeowners
their
real
property
was
assessed
at
the
rate
of
33
and
a
third
percent
of
its
fair
market
value
when
other
homeowners
were
assessed
on
average
at
a
prevailing
market
rate
of
approximately
22
percent
of
its
fair
market
value.
secondly,
they
alleged
that
in
the
course
of
appealing
certain
assessments
over
the
years,
and
particularly
in
one
particular
year,
they
were
successful
in
their
appeal
and
their
assessed
value
was
reduced,
but
that
they
and
everybody
else
who
had
appealed
in
that
year
through
the
state
process
had
been
automatically
called
up
for
reassessment
in
the
second
year,
thus
that
they
were
put
in
a
classification
of
people
who
had
exercised
their
right
to
appeal
and
when
people
exercised
their
right
to
appeal
they
were
separated
into
a
separate
class
and
subjected
to
a
reassessment
that
raised
them
back
to
where
they
had
been
assessed
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i
do
not
believe
that
anybody
has
seriously
challenged
whether
we
stated
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
as
far
as
i
can
see,
we
have
in
fact
alleged
a
cause
of
action,
and
the
district
court
dismissed
us
out
exclusively
on
the
subject
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
and,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
connection
with
that,
i
would
also
like
to
narrow
today's
discussion
in
another
respect.
while
one
of
the
petitioners
is
an
association
of
citizens,
this
act...
this
lawsuit
has
been
determined
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
cassillys'
claim,
and
the
question
that
we
come
down
to
is
the
interest
today
of
these
homeowners
in
their
right
to
pursue
their
1983
action
in
light
of
the
tax
injunction
act
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes.
judge
nangle,
the
district
court
judge
who
heard
the
case,
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds,
stating
that
this
was
like
a
tax
refund
action,
on
the
grounds
that
the
tax
injunction
act
barred
this
action,
an
action
at
law
for
damages.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
again,
your
honor,
when
one
gets
into
a
situation
that
a
case
is
being
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
it
is
difficult
sometimes
to
know
what
facts
really
will
be
material.
in
petitioners'
complaint,
they
allege
damages
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
tax
refund,
and
i
am
speaking
specifically
about
the
cassillys,
wholly
aside
from
fair
assessment
in
real
estate.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
j.
newburger
including,
but
not
exclusively.
we
have
assessed
both
excessive
taxes
and
other
monetary
damages
in
some
of
the
years
of
the
complaint
and
punitive
damages,
and
seek
to
recover
those.
i
think
that
when
we
have
the
discussion
from
judge
nangle,
when
he
says
this
is
like
a
tax
refund
action,
i
think
we
should
recognize
another
element
of
his
decision,
and
that
is,
he
said
compared
to
younger
against
harris.
without
much
analysis
of
what
that
meant,
he
was
suggesting,
i
think,
that
the
difficulty
in
this
case
is
the
difficulty
of
federalism,
that
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
federal
courts,
the
lower
federal
courts
should
hear
a
section
1983
action
at
law
for
damages
in
the
context
of
a
claim
that
the
entire
process
is
a
part
of
the
state
taxation
process,
which
is
obviously
terribly
important
to
keep
within
the
confines
of
state
law.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
great
lakes
against
huffman,
the
court
confined
itself
to
the
subject
of
declaratory
judgment
actions,
which
was
the
question
presented,
and
our
tradition
is
to
recognize
that
declaratory
judgments
actions
are
not
quite
equity
actions
but
certainly
are
in
the
realm
that
is
somewhat
similar
to
equity
actions,
and
indeed
the
argument
that
i
would
present
to
this
court,
is
that
on
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
precedents,
like
the
great
lakes
case
itself,
that
on
all
of
those
terms,
that
section
1341,
the
tax
injunction
act,
bars
the
federal
courts
from
hearing
cases
in
which
the
claim
is
for
the
exercise
of
anything
in
the
order
of
equity
jurisdiction.
but
i
likewise
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
or
the
precedents
to
suggest
that
the
claim
for
damages
should
be
barred.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
exhaustion
was
determined
in
any
way
by
1341.
i
think
that
it--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--i
would
take
the
view
that
monroe
against
pape
and
the
cases
that
followed
from
that
have
determined
the
exhaustion
question
in
respect
to
this
matter.
i
certainly
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
courts
in
a
diversity
case
simply
based
on
an
argument
of
some
inappropriate
taxation
or
taxation
contrary
to
state
law
would
be
able
to
hear
that
case
without
going
through
the
processes
of
administrative
exhaustion.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
in
a
proper
case
in
which
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
or
judicial
remedies
is
presented.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
your
honor,
the
position
that
we
take
is
that
exhaustion
is
not
required.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
the
trouble
with
the
question
is...
again
relates
back
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
have
happened.
in
two
of
the
years
that
we
have
made
a
complaint
on,
we
did
not
appeal
the
assessment.
in
two
of
the
years
we
have
complained
of,
we
did
appeal
and
complete
the
appeal
of
the
assessment.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that
went
through
the
administrative
appeal
process.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
and
in
one
of
the
years,
the
appeal
was
started,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
carried
to
completion.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
another
very
important
question
here,
when
we
talk
about
exhaustion,
and
that
is
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
what
remedy,
because
the
remedy
that
is
being
claimed
here
is
the
constitutional
remedy
to
be
protected
from
violations
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
proceeding
that
could
be
had
in
state
court
other
than
an
analogous
1983
action,
perhaps,
in
state
court
that
would--
--have
the
missouri
courts
passed
on
whether
1983
suits
may
be
brought?
to
be
perfectly
honest,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
it
can
be
done
in
missouri,
but
i
don't
i
think
that
it
is
necessarily
100
percent
clear.
but
the
fact
remains
that--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--that's
right.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that's
right,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--quite
clearly
under
the
train
of
cases
that
have
developed
around
1983
following
monroe
against
pape,
this
is
an
election
that
a
plaintiff
has
under
the
circumstances.
the
other
fact
that
is
terribly
important
to
the
question
that
you
are
pressing
me
on
is
whether,
if
we
do
proceed
with
our
case,
we
actually
are
posing
a
problem
with
the
administration
of
state
taxes,
and
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
to
recognize
that
the
case
that
we
have
prosecuted
here
has
only
minimal
impact
on
the
exercise
of
the
taxation
processes
in
the
state
of
missouri.
the
only
thing
we
are
asking
for
is
damages
arising
out
of
our
constitutional
breach
by
individual
defendants,
not
by
any
public
authority.
we
are
asking
from
the
damages
from
institutional
defendants,
and
we
are
asking
from
those
damages
based
upon
the
fact,
as
we
allege,
that
those
individual
defendants
in
bad
faith,
because,
of
course,
there
is
official
immunity
in
the
picture,
in
bad
faith--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
j.
newburger
they
are
state
and
county
officials.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
no,
your
honor.
i
am
certain
that
it
is
possible...
well,
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
the
litigation
itself
has
some
possibility
of
a
chilling
impact
on
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
they
would
pursue.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
court
has
developed
a
doctrine
of
official
immunity,
wood
v.
strickland
and
the
cases
that
are
associated
with
that,
which
i
suggest
is
a
doctrine
developed
to
protect
state
officials
so
that
they
do
properly
exercise
their
discretion.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that
is
right,
your
honor.
in
fact,
this
case
came
down
before
the
decision...
this
case
was
initiated
before
the
decision
in
independence,
but
i
doubt
that
independence
would
be
relevant
because
this
is
an
exercise
of
the
county
taxing
authority,
which
is
in
a
direct
administrative
line
from
state
taxing
authority,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
the
presence
of
a
municipal
corporation
in
the
circumstance
to
create
that
problem.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
recognize
because
of
the
official
immunity
doctrine
that
the
liability
of
these
defendants
can
only
be
established
if
we
establish
first
the
equal
protection
violation
and
second
that
they
acted
in
bad
faith,
because
when
we
worry
about
whether
the
officials'
exercise
of
discretion
will
be
hindered,
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
that
while
it
may
be
hindered,
it
is
in
a
very
limited
way,
and
it
is
certainly
no
more
hindered
than
governors
and
police
officers
and
other
officials
who
under
the
official
immunity
doctrine
may
have
some
possibility
of
liability
in
some
circumstances
where
their
bad
faith
is
established.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
if
there
were
some
reasonable
basis
for
that
classification--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--the
question,
as
i
am
sure
you
recall,
mr.
justice
stevens,
relates
back
to
the
question
of
whether
such
a
classification
is
palpably
arbitrary,
and
indeed
that
is
the
reason
that
i
am
using
the
word
"bad
faith"
in
this
discussion.
i
would
take
the
view
that
that
kind
of
classification
has
no
apparent
justification
on
its
face
unless
there
is
some
kind
of
legitimate
public
policy
of
discouraging
the
construction
of
new
homes
which
i
have
a
very
hard
time
contemplating.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes,
certainly
there
are
expenses
for
new
homes,
including
a
building
permit,
which
indeed
could
be
characterized
as
a
tax.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
and
building
inspections
could
be
characterized
as
a
tax.
if
there
were
that
kind
of
rational
basis
for
the
distinction,
then
it
may
be
that
the
classification
is
not
palpably
arbitrary,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
important
for
us
to
remember
a
couple
of
facts.
one,
under
the
law
and
the
constitution
of
missouri,
there
is
no
classification
of
real
property
to
be
recognized.
that
is
a
ground
rule
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
the
second
argument
that
i
would
make
arises
out
of
sioux
city
against
breckenridge,
which
is
a
1923
decision
of
this
court,
and
that
is
that
if
you
have
by
happenstance
a
development
in
which
there
are
some
people
who
are
assessed
at
a
much
higher
rate
than
the
prevailing
rate
throughout
the
country,
that
that
is
a
palpably
arbitrary
distinction
that
creates
a
classification
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
concede--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--i
am
suggesting
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
program
can
be
established
in
which
distinction
can
be
drawn
in
different
kinds
of
real
property.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
exact
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
prove
in
the
district
court,
if
i
am
going
to
be
heard
on
this
case,
that
these
classifications
are
palpably
arbitrary.
my
intention
in
making
that
proof
is
that
what
had
happened
was,
because
of
an
absence
of
reassessment
in
the
county,
the
county
permitted
old
properties
to
continue
at
their
level
of
assessment
for
some
20
years,
and
at
the
same
time
engaged
in
an
activity
of
assessing
new
property
at
33
and
a
third
percent
of
the
fair
market
value
of
that
property.
now,
that,
i
suggest,
is
not
a
decision
that
was
based
upon
a
rational
basis,
that
there
is
not
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
that
old
property
and
the
new
property.
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
the
case
was
in
sioux
city,
and
the
court
in
that
case
taught
all
of
us
that
that
was
a
classification
that
was
unconstitutional
within
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
well,
it
is
interesting.
sioux
city
was
cited
in
1978,
i
believe
is
the
year,
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
to
tell
the
assessors
that
in
fact
that
is
the
controlling
law
of
the
land,
and
that
they
ought
to
have
either
been
assessing
property
at
that
lower
22
percent
or
they
ought
to
be
assessing
everybody
at
the
higher
33
percent.
the
important
question,
though,
here,
is
a
question
of
federal
jurisdiction,
and
while
it
is
certainly
fair
and
fair
game
to
take
after
me
on
the
question
of
whether
i
am
going
to
prove
that
equal
protection
violation
if
i
am
returned
to
district
court,
that
is
not
what
judge
nangle
did
in
dismissing
me,
and
what
he
did
in
dismissing
me
was
to
determine
that
i
was
barred
either
by
the
tax
injunction
act
or
by
some
analogy
to
the
younger
against
harris
doctrine.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
there
are
two
different
sets
of
respondents
and
defendants
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i
don't
recall.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
are
you
thinking
of
bridgewell,
your
honor?
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i
believe
that
is
right.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
well,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
except
that
if
you
go
back
through
the
history
of
what
has
gone
on
in
this
case
in
the
state
courts,
i
believe
that
the
defendants
fully
understood
that
they
were
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
individual.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
in
1975--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--well,
that
is
right,
but
i
mean,
i
believe
that
that
is
a
matter
of
defense,
and
certainly
i
expect
to
raise
that
issue
in
a
trial.
perhaps
i
am
assuming
that
they
will
defend
on
all
issues
and
they
will
not.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
sioux
city
and
breckenridge,
and
sioux
city
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1923,
and
breckenridge
is
a
decision
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
1978.
in
addition
to
that
there
was
a
decision
of
the
missouri--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--the
practice
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
has
been
to
continue--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--and
in
the
years
it
was
involved
there
was
partial
relief
but
there
was
not
total
relief.
in
fact,
if
i
have
my
years
straight,
in
1978
there
was
a
partial
relief;
in
1979,
the
assessor's
office
issued
a
computer
letter
which,
incidentally,
is
in
the
allegations
within
the
record
here,
a
computer
letter
that
said,
since
you
got
relief
and
your
taxes
were
reduced
last
year,
we
are
automatically
raising
your
taxes
for
next
year,
and
did
not
do
that
to
anybody
except
those
people
who
had
exercised
their
right
of
appeal,
and
i
must
say,
justice
stevens,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
another
classification
in
which
i
may
be
able
to
clearly
establish
constitutional
rights
violation.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
missouri,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
the
entire
question
of
whether
there
should
be
a
reassessment
is
in
the
missouri
legal
process,
where
it
belongs.
this
court
and
the
federal
district
courts
should
not
be
hearing
the
question
of
reassessment
as
a
general
policy
matter
within
this
court.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i...
no.
i
do
not
believe
the
question
is
pending
at
all,
because
i
believe
it
was
decided
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
breckenridge,
and
in
another
case
which
is
estate
of
cassilly
against
reining,
and
by
the
lower
courts
on
numerous
occasions--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--certainly.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
i
believe
it
bears
most
importantly
on
the
question
in
this
regard.
we
are
not
raising
the
question
of
litigating
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
plain,
speedy,
or
adequate
remedy.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
well,
we
assume
that--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--without
making
inappropriate
concessions.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
tax
injunction
act
which
refers
to
the
federal
courts
in
joining,
suspending,
or
restraining
the
actions
related
to
tax
assessment
is
simply
unrelated
to
damage
actions,
and
that
the
tax
injunction
act
nor
the
doctrines
of
comity,
as
this
court
has
developed
them
over
the
years,
in
the
absence
of
any
suggestion
of
a
claim
for
the
exercise
of
equity
jurisdiction,
should
bar
this
action.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
unless
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
new
precedent,
which
it
has
not
so
far
done,
that
requires
the
pursuit
of
a
1983
action
in--
mr.
david
j.
newburger
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
j.
newburger
yes.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
okay.
if
i
may
reserve
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
are
a
couple
of
points
that
i
would
like
to
specifically
address
that
the
justices
raised
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
if
i
might,
justice
o'connor,
address
the
question
that
you
asked
first,
don't
we
think
that
congress
really
wasn't
thinking
about
injunctions,
i
must
admit
that
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
we
have
specified
these
two
cases
at
page
16
of
the
reply
brief,
in
which
the
courts
quite
clearly
took
the
view
that
a
damage
action
could
be
brought.
i
think
that
congress
could
have
found
those
cases.
whether
they
found
them
or
didn't,
i
don't
know,
but
that
leads
me
perhaps
to
the
second
most
important
portion
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
that
is
that
congress
very
clearly
established
the
jurisdictional
bar,
and
specified
with
specific
words
what
the
jurisdictional
bar
was
going
to
be.
the
jurisdictional
bar
was
against
actions
or
suits,
rather,
to
enjoin,
suspend,
or
restrain.
it
says
nothing
about
actions
for
damages.
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
terribly
plain,
and
under
those
circumstances
i
think
if
the
bar
is
to
be
extended
because
of
policy
considerations,
that
it
should
be
extended
by
congress
and
not
the
court.
that
brings
me
to
the
question
that
justice
blackmun
raised.
what
speculation
can
one
have
for
why
the
eighth
circuit
evenly
divided
on
the
question?
and
i
think
that
what...
and
i,
if
i
may,
will
exercise
the
discretion
to
speculate
myself.
i
think
that
the
telling
argument
that
makes
the
case
terribly
convincing
on
behalf
of
petitioners
is
that
there
is
no
precedent
in
the
comity
cases,
and
there
is
no
way
to
read
the
tax
injunction
act
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
this
action
should
be
barred.
the
comity
cases
have
confined
themselves
to
areas
of
equity.
this
is
not
an
equity
action.
the
tax
injunction
act,
as
i
suggest,
is
plain
on
its
face.
well,
what
was
the
concern?
why
was
it
a
four-four
split?
i
submit
that
the
reason
that
it
is
a
four-four
split
is
because
we
are
raising
a
troublesome
question.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
federal
courts
in
some
way
may
become
involved
in
reviewing
what
is
going
on
in
the
state
assessment
processes.
i
submit
that
that
concern,
however,
was
overstated
or
overworried
in
the
eighth
circuit
for
these
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
an
effort
to
take
money
from
the
state
coffers.
it
is
an
action
against
individuals.
second,
there
are
all
kinds
of
good
faith
defenses
that
are
available.
if
we
get
to
the
merits
and
we
can't
prove
what
we
are
saying,
we
are
going
to
lose.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
as
far
as
the
second
claim
for
relief
is
concerned,
i
won't
have
to
prove
that,
the
second
claim
being
this
computer
letter
that
automatically
picked
people
up.
as
far
as
the
first
claim
for
relief
is
concerned,
i
will
have
to
show
that
the
classification
that
occurred
was
palpably
arbitrary.
mr.
david
j.
newburger
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
the
point
that
i
would
make
in
light
of
that,
when
one
talks
about
our
worrying
about
being
in
the
state
processes,
if
what
we
are
going
for
is
simply
a
new
political
process
or
a
new
policy
process
within
the
state,
we
would
not
undertake
the
burden
of
proving
palpably
arbitrary
classification.
the
question,
if
we
are
going
to
the
future
policy
of
what
is
going
to
go
on
to
the
state,
we
will
do
that
in
the
state
courts.
we
have
done
that
in
the
state
courts.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
in
the
course
of
going
through
the
process
of
raising
the
question
in
the
state
courts,
these
people
became
mad
at
us,
and
they
took
out
after
us,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that
they
violated
our
constitutional
rights,
and
we
have
a
right
under
section
1983
to
obtain
the
federal
court
protection
of
our
constitutional
rights
if
we
can
show
that
they
purposely
set
about
to
violate
those
rights.
if
we
can't
prove
that,
then
we
can't
prevail.
we
ask
the
court
to
send
us
back
and
give
us
our
day
in
court
so
that
we
can
demonstrate
that
we
can
indeed
prove
that.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
