mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
comment
on
mr.
newburger's
statement
that
he
felt
that
this
case
could
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
tax
officials
of
st.
louis
county
and
of
the
state
of
missouri.
i
believe
that
is
why
we
are
here,
because
we
feel
that
this
court
and
all
the
other
courts
as
well
as
congress,
that
their
intent
was
when
they
passed
the
tax
injunction
act,
was
to
keep
federal
district
courts
from
interfering
with
the
collection
of
state
taxes
as
far
as
the
method,
assessment,
levy,
and
collection
was
concerned,
and
when
he
says
that
no
doubt
that
this
cause
of
action
will
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
tax
officials,
then
we
submit
to
you
that
it
is
the
reason,
that
is
the
reason
why
judge
nangle
said
what
he
said,
because
he
said
he
could
not
in
any
way
go
into
this
lawsuit
without
actually
becoming
an
appellate
court
in
regard
to
the
assessment
of
taxes
in
st.
louis
county.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
i
think
it
would
be
an
action
to
restrain
and
suspend,
not
to
enjoin,
because
when
we
look
at
what
the
meanings
of
those
words
are,
restrain,
to
restrain
and
suspend,
restrain,
you
know,
to
pull
the
effect
back.
and
so
if
any
cause
of
action,
be
it
an
injunction
suit,
declaratory
judgment
suit,
a
suit
for
a
tax
refund,
or
just
a
plain
damage
suit
like
this,
it
is
going
to
have
the
effect
of
pulling
back
what
the
tax
official
is
going
to
do
in
his
job.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir,
but--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--mr.
justice,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
no,
sir,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--well,
the
declaratory
judgment
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--but
the
courts
have
looked
on
it
as
different,
judge,
and
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
history--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--there
is
a
difference,
yes,
sir,
but
when
we
look
at
the
history--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
it
helps
us
on
damages
for
this
reason.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
when
the
tax
injunction
act
was
passed,
what
congress
had
in
mind
at
that
time
was
the
fact
that
there
was
discrimination
against
state--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir,
but
the--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
but
they
limited
it
to
injunctions,
but,
judge,
the
court
has
extended
it
to
declaratory
judgments.
the
courts
have
extended
it
to
declaratory
judgments,
and
i
think
if
congress--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--possibly.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
it
could.
yes,
judge,
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
you
first
have
to
have
a
declaratory
judgment
saying
that
this
act
or
this
act
or
some
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
well,
judge--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir,
you
could,
but
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--you've
got
to
have
a
judgment.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
in
this
case,
i
think
before,
under
these
facts,
which
was
a
motion
to
dismiss...
this
is
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
no
question
about
it.
there
are
two
sets
of
defendants
here.
one,
the
county
defendants,
the
county
assessor,
the
county
collector
of
revenue,
and
the
county
executive.
there
is
also
a
set
of
defendants
of
the
missouri
state
tax
commission.
now,
the
missouri
state
tax
commission
filed
an
answer,
i
call
them
the
state
defendants.
the
county
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
comity
and
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
judge
nangle
sustained
that
motion
to
dismiss,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here,
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
judge,
i
might
point
out
that
the
breckenridge
case
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
had
never
been
tried.
it
came
back
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
we
submit
that,
judge,
before
any
damages
could
be
sustained
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
trial
court,
the
district
judge
first
is
going
to
have
to
go
into
the
manner
of
assessment,
how
the
assessment
was
arrived
at
comparing
new
homes
to
old
homes,
and
how
it
was
applied,
and
then
we
submit,
then
you
are
getting
back
into
an
attack
on
tax
assessment,
and
this
court
as
well
as
all
other
federal
courts,
the
history
has
been
that
they
have
deferred
to
the
state
courts.
they
say,
you
have
a
plain,
speedy,
efficient
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
you
take
your
matter
to
the
state
courts,
do
not
come
to
the
federal
courts.
that
has
been
the
history,
even
before
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
we
submit
that
since
that
tax
injunction
act,
that
the
courts
have...
they
started
out
with
injunction
suits,
but
then
they
have
gone
to
declaratory
judgment
suits,
they
have
gone
to
tax
refund
suits.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
have
said
that
on
a
tax
refund
suit,
which
was
not...
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
tax
refund
suit
as
far
as
when
the
tax
injunction
act
was
passed,
but
in
those
two
circuits
they
have
said
that
what
congress
intended,
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
in
the
past,
we
now
extend
to
a
tax
refund
suit,
and
therefore
the
tax
injunction
act
would
bar
us.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
no,
sir,
we
wouldn't,
but
we
do
have
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
not
with
one
of
our
motions
to
dismiss.
it
was
based
on
this.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
no,
sir,
that
is
what
the
court
found
on
both
of
them.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
judge
nangle
said--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir,
we
would
be
satisfied
with
a
tax
refund
or
comity.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
you
pay
your
tax
under
protest,
and
within
90
days
you
file
a
suit
in
the
circuit
court,
and
at
that
point
we
say,
besides
that,
they
take
an
appeal,
the
county
board
of
equalization,
to
the
state
tax
commission,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
their
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
at
law
which
the
tax
injunction
act--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--i
think...
yes,
sir,
judge,
yes.
that
is
how
the
breckenridge
case
went
up.
it
was
on
a
tax
protest
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir,
because,
judge,
i
think
the
tax
injunction
act
would
come
in
for
this
reason.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
way
you
could
arrive
at
that
decision
without
going
into
the
matter
of
assessment.
you
have
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
that
is
right,
judge,
because
of
the
fact
of,
i
think,
bland
versus
mchann.
that
was
a
case
in
which
they...
of
course,
that
was
an
injunction
case
and
for
damages,
and
that
was
one
of
our
allegations,
that
because
of
their
race,
and
because
of
the
demonstrations,
that
their
property
tax
assessments
had
been
increased,
but
the
court
said,
we
have
to
inquire
into
the
method
of
assessment,
and
because
we
have
to
inquire
into
the
method
of
assessment,
then
the
tax
injunction
act
comes
into
play,
and
would
bar
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
i
think
on
the
question
of
comity,
deferring
to
the
court,
and
i
think--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--sir?
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
well,
i
think
judge
nangle
was
saying
that
because
of
the
history
of
the
federal
courts
deferring
questions
of
state
taxation
to
the
state
courts,
then
that
is
where
they
should
be;
even
though
we
have
the
tax
injunction
act,
they
still
should
be
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
that
was
equity,
yes,
sir,
but
he
was
extending
it,
saying,
well,
since
that
has
been
the
history,
and
that
has
been,
as
the
court
said
in
bland
versus
mchann,
the
long-standing
judicial
policy,
and
congressional
restriction
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
cases
involving
state
tax
administration
makes
it
the
duty
of
federal
courts
to
withhold
relief,
and
i
think
that
is
what
judge
nangle
had,
the
long-standing
policy
of
the
federal
courts
and
congressional
restraint.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
i
think
either
ground
would
apply,
sir.
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
i
don't
know.
i
can't
answer
that,
judge.
i
know
they
did
not
come
down
with
any
opinion,
so
we
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
i
believe,
judge,
the
only
thing
i
might
say,
and
it
might
be
speculation
on
my
part,
is,
right
before
that
the
court,
i
think
it
was
the
seventh
circuit,
came
out
with
the
fulton
market
case,
in
which
they
permitted
a
damage
suit
under
1983,
and
said
that
the
tax
injunction
act
would
not
bar
it,
and
i
say
possibly
four
of
the
judges
on
the
eighth
circuit
thought
maybe
they
should
follow
that
and
four
might
think
they
could
distinguish
it,
and
i
think
it
can
be
distinguished.
i
do
not
think
it
is
so
applicable.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
i
am
sorry,
judge?
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
that
i
am
not
going
to
say,
judge,
because
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
were
or
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
no,
sir,
we
say
that
the
state
remedy
is
adequate.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
well,
i
know
that
for
two
years
they
have
appealed
in
the
state
and
it
is
still
pending.
two
years,
they
did
not.
1975
and
1976
they
did
not
appeal;
on
1978
and
1979
they
have
appealed.
so
i
assume
that
they
feel
it
is
adequate.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
well,
i
would
have
to
say
sort
of
a
qualified
yes,
because
at
that
time
i
think
all
you
had
in
the
federal
courts
were
injunction
actions,
and
i
don't
think
they
thought
sitting
back
then
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
maybe
back
in
1981,
that
somebody
was
going
to
come
in
and
ask
for
damages,
because
what
they
were
doing,
in
my
opinion,
they
were
putting
into
a
statute
what
the
federal
courts
had
been
doing.
they
were
concerned,
i
believe,
about
a
number
of
things,
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
they
were
concerned
about
was
at
that
time
cases
against
local
officials,
but
since
there
had
not
been
that
type
of
action,
only
injunction
suits,
i
think
that
is
why
they
worded
it
the
way
they
did,
but
i
think
we
must
look
at
the
fact
that
it
was
taken
after
the
johnson
act,
as
we
state
in
our
brief.
it
was
almost
the
exact
wording
of
the
johnson
act,
and
there
is
no
question,
i
don't
think,
about
that
act
being
a
complete
bar
to
any
case
filed
in
a
federal
district
court
in
regard
to
an
administrative
agency
setting
utility
rates
in
a
state,
and
when
we
look
at
that
history
and
see
that
that
was
the
act
that
the
tax
injunction
act
was
patterned
after,
then
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question,
and
when
we
look
at
the
report
that
came
out
of
the
senate
and
the
house,
they
didn't
just
say
the
reports
say
that
this
was
an
action
where
the
federal
district
courts
cannot
enjoin.
they
said
this
is
going
to
apply
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
i
submit
that
when
you
look
at
what
senator
bohn
said
with
regard
to
it,
because
he
read,
he
was
a
sponsor
and
he
read
from
the
johnson
act
in
his
statement
to
congress,
and
he
said,
this
act
is
patterned
after
that
one,
so
if
we
look
at
that
history,
and
we
look
at
the
intent,
and
then
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
over
the
years--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--judge,
i
think
if
you
read
those
cases,
they
were
applying
state
law.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
they
were
applying
state
law,
but
i
think--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
but
most
of
those,
i
think
you
will
see,
they
called
them
damages.
they
were
refund
actions,
but
now
we
have
some
of
these
circuits
that
actually
have
held
that
the
tax
injunction
act
applies
even
on
refund
actions.
i
think
it
is
the
case
out
in
california
where
the
court
said
that
this
is
going
to
affect
the
tax--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--there
were
precedents
in
regard
to--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
not
as
clearly,
but
i
think
congress
knew
at
that
time
that
there
were
suits
under
state
law
for
state
refunds,
but
i
do
not
think
they
felt
at
that
time
there
was
going
to
be,
say,
a
civil
rights
action
brought
against
a
state
official,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir,
but
see,
those
cases
were
not
based
upon
a
federal
statute.
state
statutes.
they
were
based
upon
state
statutes.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
well,
not
necessarily.
they
were--
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
--well,
they
were
getting
injunction
relief
from
the
federal
court,
though.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
but
i
would
still
submit
that
the
tax
injunction
act,
because
of
congress'
intention
at
the
time,
and
what
the
federal
courts
have
done,
not
only
before
but
since
then,
they
have
extended
it.
we
go
from
injunction,
to
declaratory
judgment,
to
refund,
and
now
we
come
to
damage
suits,
and
i
submit
that
when
we
look
at
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
your
various
circuits,
we
look
at
the
case
involving...
the
monman
case,
out
of
the
city
of
cambridge,
and
we
are
talking
about
suits
for
declaratory
judgments.
when
they
said
that
declaratory
judgment
action
as
well
as
this
damage
claim...
as
well
as
this
damage
claim...
is
predicted
upon
the
invalidity
of
the
assessment,
and
it
is
in
essence
an
attack
upon
the
tax
assessment,
then
they
say
that
the
tax
injunction
act
would
be
a
bar
even
though,
even
though
it
is
brought
under
1983,
and
we
look
at
the
district
court
case,
the
advertiser
claim
against
governor
wallace,
that
was
a
damage
suit,
strictly
a
damage
suit,
and
the
court
found
there,
and
let
me
quote
for
just
a
moment
from
that,
"the
same
principles
which
preclude
awarding
anticipatory
relief
or
a
refund
should
also
preclude
an
award
of
damages
sought
in
this
case.
"
they
say
"the
damage
award
plaintiff
seeks,
especially
its
request
for
punitive
damages,
still
is
designed
to
deter
collection
of
the
taxes
now
being
assessed
by
defendants.
"
i
think
that...
we
submit
that
when
we
are
talking
about
this
cause
of
action,
that
if
it
has
been
any
deterrent
effect
upon
the
assessment,
the
collection,
or
the
levy
of
taxes
by
state
officials
or
by
county
officials,
because
the
county
officials
in
the
first
instance
did
the
things
they
complained
about,
then
i
think
that
what
was
said
in
advertiser
is
true.
it
is
designed
to
deter
the
collection
of
taxes
being
assessed
by
defendants,
and
we
submit
that
even
though
it
as
an
eight
to
eight,
we
submit
that
what
judge
nangle
held
in
his
decision,
when
he
said
that
he
would
in
effect
become
an
appellate
court
for
appeals
from
the
local
tax
assessor,
if
he
had
to
hear
this
case,
we
submit
that
he
is
correct,
he
is
right,
and
when
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
we
look
at
what
the
courts
have
done
prior
to
it
and
since
then,
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
judge
nangle
should
be
affirmed
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
as
mr.
newburger
said,
there
had
not
been
a
reassessment
of
all
property
in
st.
louis
county
until
some
time
in
the
sixties.
the
new
homes,
so
i
don't
know
how
you
look
at
it,
judge,
but
you
could
say
the...
actually,
and
so
the
homes
were
being
assessed
at
33
and
a
third
percent
of
their
market
value,
but
because
of
inflation
the
value
had
gone
up.
all
homes
were
assessed
at
33
and
a
third,
and
the
new
homes
came
on
at
their
market
value,
and
they
were
assessed
at
33
and
a
third.
the
appeal
to
the
board
of
equalization,
they
reduced
the
assessment.
now,
under
missouri
law
the
assessor
is
to
assess
property
at
33
and
a
third,
and
so
that
is
why
the
assessor
was
faced
with
this.
under
missouri
law,
i
must
assess
property
at
33
and
a
third
percent
of
its
true
market
value.
now,
even
though
the
board
of
equalization
reduced
that
percentage
last
year,
i
think
i
must
follow
state
law,
and
that
is
why
he
put
it
back
at
33
and
a
third,
because
he
must
do
that
under
state
law,
and
the
notice
goes
out
because
that
gives
them
a
chance...
under
state
law
they
must
be
notified
if
their
assessments
increase,
so
they
would
have
a
right,
and
time
to
take
their
appeal
to
the
board
of
equalization
or
the
state
tax
commission.
mr.
thomas
w.
wehrle
no,
sir.
st.
louis
county
and
st.
louis
city
are
two
separate
entities,
judge.
