mr.
brent
r.
appel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court,
in
addition
to
responding
to
whatever
questions
you
may
have,
i
think
it
would
be
most
helpful
if
i
focus
on
four
general
areas
of
this
case.
first,
i
think
we
have
to
understand
precisely
what
the
regulation
under
question
here
does.
it
stands
for
the
following
proposition.
if
i
am
a
wealthy
lawyer
earning
$100,000
a
year,
and
i
have
a
spouse
who
for
whatever
medical
reason
needs
to
be
institutionalized
in
a
skilled
24-hour
a
day
nursing
home,
a
person
representing
the
iowa
department
of
social
services
cannot
deem
my
income
available
to
the
spouse
that
is
institutionalized
beyond
a
one-month
period.
the
only
alternative
for
the
state
of
iowa
is
to
use
spousal
responsibility
statutes
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to.
with
respect
to
those
spousal
responsibility
statutes,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
in
gray
panthers
was
rather
explicit
in
outlining
how
impractical
resort
by
administrative
agencies
like
that
iowa
department
of
social
services
to
spousal
responsibility
statutes
are.
there
are
difficulties
of
obtaining
service,
there
is
a
protracted
litigation,
and
it
is
almost
not
worth
the...
sometimes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
except
when
you
get
a
multiplicity
of
cases.
we
are
not
dealing
with
ten,
fifteen.
we
could
have
quite
a
few.
it
is
somewhat
like
the
child
support
recovery
program,
which
we
have.
now,
that
is
a
little
different,
in
part,
because
there
is
no
federal
largesse
involved,
and
therefore
we
have
a
little
higher
standard.
we
have
got
to
serve
process,
and
we
have
got
to
have
the
court
proceeding.
but
here
we
are
linking
it
to
medicaid
benefits
that
are
actually
paid.
but
that
is
the
effect
of
the
regulation
at
bar
here.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
clarify
models
of
adjudication
that
are
really...
really
at
issue
here,
and
the
petitioners
and
the
state
of
iowa
have
distinctly
different
models.
the
petitioners
have
a
legislative
effect
model.
basically
what
they
are
saying
is
that
health
and
human
services
has
kind
of
sketched
in
the
details
of
the
congressional
statute,
and
that
therefore
the
regulation
involved
is
entitled
to
legislative
effect.
the
theory
that
you
are
all,
of
course,
familiar
with
is
that
specialized
agencies
ought
to
fill
in
those
gaps.
this
court
doesn't
sit
as
kind
of
a
super-agency
to
review
closed
decision-making.
but
iowa
has
a
distinctly
different
model.
iowa's
model
is
the
ultra
vires
model
that
says
that
the
secretary
of
hhs
in
creating
this
one-month
iron
curtain
on
deeming
is
not
sketching
in
detail,
but
is
totally
outside
the
congressional
framework,
and
as
a
result
or
that
this
is
an
area
where
courts
traditionally
police
the
agencies,
and
since
the
regulation
involved
is
invalid,
it
has
no
effect
from
the
beginning,
and
iowa
is
not
in
violation
of
any
valid
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary.
so,
those
are
the
two
models
that
i
think
are
distinctly
different,
and
that
may
give
the
case
some
focus.
let
me
share
with
you
some
of
the
reasons
why
iowa
believes
the
ultra
vires
model
is
more
applicable
than
the
legislative
effect
model.
first,
we
go
to
the
statute
itself,
section
17(b)
and
(d)
of
the
medicaid
program
itself.
basically
what
this
statutory
framework
says
is
that
the
states
must
promulgate
reasonable
standards
for
medicaid;
17(b)
notes
that
the
state
can
only
consider
available
income
"according
to
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary.
"
and
then
17(d)
talks
about
spousal
deeming
of
income,
and
basically
17(d)
says
that
other
than
spouses
you
can't
deem
income
because
consanguinity
isn't
close
enough,
but
spouses
is
authorized.
now,
the
court
in
the
gray
panthers
case
construed
that
provision,
17(d),
and
on
17(d)
it
said,
unless
we
hold
this
as
express
authorization
for
the
state
to
deem
the
income
of
spouses,
it
would
be
superfluous.
it
would
be
meaningless.
it
is
a
little
awkward.
it
doesn't
expressly
grant
the
states
the
authority
to
deem
spousal
income,
but
it
knocks
everyone
else
out.
it
knocks
out
brothers
and
sisters
and
aunts
and
uncles.
but
in
gray
panthers,
if
you
read
the
case
carefully,
it
states
clearly
that
unless
you
construe
17(d)
to
mean
states,
you
can
deem
spousal
income,
it
would
be
literally
stricken
from
the
statute.
secondly,
in
gray
panthers
there
is
a
gloss
of
legislative
history.
i
don't
want
to
protract
that,
but
one
of
the
senate
committee
reports
that
is
cited
there
states
that
it
is
proper
to
expect
spouses
to
support
each
other.
i
think
that
comports
fairly
with
our
everyday
experience.
secondly,
let
me
point
out
the
secretary
has
not
promulgated
a
standard,
really.
iowa's
position
is
that
it
is
a
time
limitation.
it
has
no
connection
at
all
with
the
availability
of
income,
how
much
money
the
other
spouse
is
making,
what
the
obligations
of
the
other
spouse
might
be
on
the
strength
of
the
marriage
relationship.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
it
would
be
conceivable
that
a
time
limitation
would
be
appropriate
if
it
could
be
shown
that
it
had
some
kind
of
rational
relationship
with
expectations
of
spousal
support.
if
the
secretary
in
notice
and
comment
in
the
federal
register
said,
listen,
we
have
decided
that
after
six
years
or
five
years
the
family
obligation
dilutes,
or
practical
experience
shows
that
we
just
can't
enforce
it...
strike
that.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
but
experience
shows
us
that
somehow
the
family
relationship
is
so
diluted
then
that
you
can't
expect
it.
then,
perhaps.
for
instance,
in
the
dandridge
case,
we
are
talking
about
standard
of
need
for
afdc
and
the
result
of
it
as
well,
and
it
is
described
by
this
court
as
a
yardstick,
a
measuring
device,
something
like
standard
review
that
the
court
uses.
you
can
have
a
stringent
standard
of
review
in
first
amendment
cases,
or
a
lax
standard
of
review
as
we
have
in
agency
cases
where
legislative
effect
is
given
to
the
regulation.
but
what
the
secretary
has
done
is
in
fact
set
no
standard,
but
kind
of
brought
down
a
time
limitation
that
is
irrational.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
congress...
congress's
delegation
must
be
considered
in
the
context
not
only
of
17(b),
which
says
standards,
but
17(d)
as
well.
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
for
the
secretary
to
be
able
to
use
a
one-month
cutoff
that
has
no
relationship
whatever
to
spousal
responsibility.
in
effect
what
that
does
is
through
regulation
draw
a
dotted
line
through
17(d)
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
is
ultra
vires.
the
secretary
clearly
has
power
to
prescribe
standards,
and
draw
the
lines.
the
secretary
may
come
in
and
say,
listen,
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
more
than
$300
of
income
deemed
to
the
other
spouse
from
a
person
who
earns
$15,000,
or
wherever
they
set
the
line.
those
lines
are
entitled
to
legislative
effect.
iowa
could
not
come
before
the
court
and
say,
you
know,
we
think
it
ought
to
be
$300,
not
$200,
or
we
think
the
upper
income
ought
to
be
$50,000
instead
of
$40,000.
those
kinds
of
lines
are
entitled
to
legislative
effect.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no,
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
hhs
on
the
matter.
the
brief,
if
i
can
characterize
it,
basically
follows
the
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
it
did,
four-four,
and
in
fact,
i
think
the
split--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
whether
or
not
a
statute
is
ultra
vires
can
be
a
close
call,
and
in
fact--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--not
on
this
particular
one,
because
i
think--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
the
congressional
directive
is
pretty
clear
in
17(d),
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
the
reason
for
that,
i
think,
is
that
they
misapplied
the
batterton
test.
the
batterton
test,
i
would
suggest,
is
not
applicable
in
this
precise
setting.
why
is
it
not
applicable?
first,
in
batterton...
batterton
is
an
interesting
case,
and
it
somewhat
tracks
the
case,
but
let
me
distinguish
it
while
it
is
open
to
the
court.
batterton,
as
i
am
sure
you
will
recall,
was
a
case
that
involved
unemployment
benefits,
and
the
health
and
human
services
had
a
regulation
which
allowed
states
to
disqualify
families
from
afdc
benefits
if
the
father
became
unemployed
because
of
illegal
activity
that
might
have
disqualified
the
father
from
unemployment
benefits
under
state
law,
unlawful
strike,
that
kind
of
thing.
and
the
batterton
case
made
a
couple
of
observations.
first,
it
noted
that
there
was
no
indication
in
the
statutory
language
or
history
that
this
factor
could
not
be
taken
into
account.
that
is
at
430...
432
u.
s.
425.
au
contraire
here,
here
we
have
the
express
17(d),
which
has
been
held
that
it
allows
spousal
deeming.
other
than
that,
it
is
going
to
get
stricken...
it
is
stricken
from
the
statute.
and
so
therefore
it
is
distinguishable
there.
second,
in
batterton
it
was
conceded
that
the
secretary
could
not
adopt
a
regulation
that
has
no
meaningful
relationship
to
any
recognized
concept
of
unemployment
or
that
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
medicaid.
let
me
put
this
in
the
context
of
the
present
case.
what
meaningful
relationship
does
this
one-month
window
have
toward
the
availability
of
income
of
the
non-institutionalized
spouse
to
the
other?
not
yet
in
this
case
has
that
regulation
been
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
is
some
kind
of
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
is
available
or
not.
the
only
ground
that
has
been
asserted
is
that
because
it
is
used
in
ssi,
therefore
it
has
to
be
used
in
ssi
states
under
medicaid,
so
there
is
kind
of
an
administrative
jump
but
nowhere
is
a
rational
relationship
shown
between
a
one-month
window
and
deeming
policy
generally.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
or
exceeded
the
statutory
authority.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i
think
that
the
different
models
have
to
be
kept
in
place.
sure,
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
said.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judgment
of
whether
or
not
a
regulation
is
outside
the
congressional
framework,
specifically
where
you
have
the
clear
17(d)
authorization,
is
something
far
different
than
the
line
drawing
that
otherwise
occurs
in
the
guts
of
administrative
statutes
that
this
court
construes
daily.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
right.
in
the
ssi
statute
itself,
there
are
provisions
which
appear
to
set
up
the
one-month
window.
there
is
a
specific
statutory
provision
of
ssi...
i
think
it
is
1382;
it
is
cited
in
the
briefs...
that
basically
says
you
can
deem...
implies
that
you
can
deem
the
income
when
they
are
living...
when
the
spouses
are
living
together,
and
hhs
has
said,
well,
that
means
living
together.
that
means
if
they
are
separated
we
can't
deem
any
income.
query
whether
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
the
approach
that
has
been
taken
by
hhs
under
ssi.
and
what
the
petitioners'
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
because
that
is
what
goes
on
under
ssi,
that
is
what
has
got
to
happen
under
medicaid.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
congress
frankly
in
legislating
can
be
as
arbitrary
as
it
wants.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
that--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
am
saying
that
in
this
discussion,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
critical
to
the
guts
of
iowa's
case,
which
again
rotates
around
the
fact
that
17(d)
expressly
allows
the
states
to
salvage
some
kind
of
deeming
policy,
subject,
to
be
sure,
subject
to
whatever
standards
the
secretary
might
set
for
what
is
acceptable
deeming.
i
might
note
that
in
norman
v.
st.
claire,
which
is
admittedly
a
circuit
court
case,
but
it
describes
some
of
the
history
of
what
occurred
prior
to
the
passage
of
some
of
these
consolidating
statutes,
and
indeed,
in
all
the
states,
under
the
kerr-mills
program,
you
had
all
different
kinds
of
formulae
for
deeming,
and
they
are
in
all
different
directions,
and
the
idea
was
to
kind
of
consolidate
these
together
and
get
one
general
parameter
of
where
deeming
was
allowed.
that
is
the
standard
that
the
secretary
should
promulgate.
the
secretary
should
come
out
and
say,
listen,
again,
here
is
a
matrix,
like
in
dandridge...
or
rosaldo
actually
has
the
matrix.
here
is
a
matrix
of
the
standard
of
deemability.
beyond
a
certain
threshold,
can't
deem,
states.
let's
get
it
all
together.
but
again,
we
are
writing
out
17(d)
of
the
statute,
out
of
the
medicaid
statute.
i
want
to
point
out
the
difference,
too,
between
medicaid
and
ssi.
ssi,
as
the
court
is
aware,
is
a
federal
program,
totally
federal
funded,
has
a
much
different
philosophy
than
medicaid.
the
medicaid
is
a
cooperative
state
program.
the
states
are
entitled...
are
in
fact
directed
to
establish
plans
with
all
kinds
of
options
and
discretions
and
so
forth.
that
is
what
section
17
is
all
about.
now,
by
passing
ssi,
it
seems
to
me
congress
did
not
intend
to
take
the
state
discretion
expressly
given
in
17(d)
for
deeming
out
of
the
medicaid
program.
let
me
point
out
this
209(b)
matter
that
has
been
raised
with
the
court.
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
that
iowa
is
trying
to
get
in
the
back
door.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
iowa
could
go
back
and
become
a
209(b)
state,
yes,
if
it
chose.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no.
in
fact,
if
we
were
a
209(b)
case,
i
think,
under
gray
panthers,
we
could
have
a
much
broader
deeming
regulation.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
if
we
said,
listen--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--no,
no.
no.
iowa
is
a
so-called
ssi
state.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
it
has
the
option
of
becoming
a
209(b)
state,
which
under
gray
panthers
allows
broader
deeming,
but
iowa
doesn't
want
to
do
that.
why
doesn't
iowa
want
to
become
a
209(b)
state?
a
number
of
reasons.
one,
under
ssi
there
is
expanded
benefits
to
minor
handicapped
children,
and
there
is
a
more
liberalized
threshold
requirement,
more
liberalized
financial
eligibility
requirements.
in
fact,
iowa
has
taken
a
liberal
approach.
to
go
back
to
209(b)--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--oh,
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that
is
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
that's
correct.
moreover,
let
me--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that
has
this
one
month.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
let
me
draw
the
court's
attention,
too,
to
the
fact
that
under
a
state's
medicaid
policy,
all
of
its
standards
that
are
set
up
under
section
17
must
be
reasonable
or
they
get
struck
down.
so
if
iowa
or
any
other
state
had
some
kind
of
draconian
deeming
policy,
that
tried
to
squeeze
blood
out
of
a
turnip,
that
would
be
unreasonable
under
the
statute,
and
so
this
forced
choice
business
of
driving
someone
into
abject
poverty
in
order
to
make
the...
to
satisfy
the
deeming
policy
may
indeed
be
unreasonable,
and
is
subject
to
judicial
attack
on
that
ground,
and
again,
let
me
make
very
clear,
iowa
is
perfectly
prepared
to
follow
whatever
standards
are
set
by
the
secretary.
that
is
his
prerogative.
that
is
what
17(b)
says,
deeming
according
to
standards.
but
we
want
to
be
able
to
deem
spousal
income,
as
we
are
expressly
authorized.
and
that
is
what
is
being
cut
off.
again,
to
put
the
209(b)
option
in
focus,
we
are
talking
about
a
narrow
part
of
the
medicaid
program.
according
to
the
federal
resister,
only
7
percent
of
institutionalized
persons
actually
have
spouses.
they
tend
to
be
elderly.
and
of
those
7
percent,
many
of
them
have
very
little
income
at
all.
they
are
also
eligible
spouses,
and
so
there
is
no
deeming
to
be
done.
we
are
talking
about
a
narrow
case
here.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
it
does,
because
the
whole
medicaid
liability
in
the
state
of
iowa
is
tremendous.
it
runs
into
millions
and
millions
of
dollars.
i
think
$200
million
may
be
near
accurate.
cocounsel
suggests
it
is.
and
so
even
a
small
fraction...
i
don't
have
an
accurate
figure
for
how
much
this
would
cost
the
state
of
iowa,
because
of
our--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
no.
i
am
not
convinced
of
that.
i
think,
though
it
is
not
going
to
cost...
it
is
not
half
of
the
$200
million
in
total
medicaid
costs.
nursing
home
care
is
a
large
part
of
the
overall
$200
million,
and
if
it
costs
$12
million,
or
$500,000,
and
i
don't
have
that
figure
in
part
because
medicaid
deeming
is
administered
locally,
so
i
don't
have
a
centralized
figure,
but
if
it
costs
half
a
million
dollars,
that
is
a
lot
of
service.
and
iowa
wishes
to
maintain
its
liberal
policies.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
it
sure
is.
well,
at
these
prices,
not
so
much.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
it
could.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
if
we
chose
to
pursue
relative
responsibility.
i
am
not
sure
how
much
income
we
could
get.
we
would
have
to
hire
new
attorneys.
we
would
have
to
pursue
service
of
process.
i
do
know
that
in
our
child
support
recovery
operations
in
our
own
office,
we
have
seven
or
eight
attorneys,
and
they
are
traveling
around
the
state,
and
i
might
point
out
that
those
attorneys
under
iowa
law
are
paid
for
out
of
the
social
services
budget.
so
for
every
dollar
we
expend
on
attorneys,
you
know,
to
litigate
these
cases,
it
is
coming
out
of
social
services
generally.
i
don't
know
whether
the
expenses
would
be
worth...
it
would
certainly
be
an
administrative
burden,
and
again,
the
court
in
gray
panthers
i
thought
was
rather
clear
on
that
point.
a
few
other
miscellaneous
observations,
if
i
may.
again
i
want
to
stress
the
narrowness
of
this
case.
we
are
not
challenging
the
whole
ssi
and
medicaid
concept.
if
congress
tomorrow
passes
a
statute
that
adds
another
category
to
ssi
benefits
generally,
we
are
moving
right
along.
iowa
will
adopt
it
because
it
is
an
ssi
state.
if
congress
adds
five
categories
tomorrow,
iowa
will
move
right
along.
it
is
an
ssi
state.
the
only
thing
we
are
saying
is
that
the
medicaid
statute
expressly
allows
us
to
do
spousal
deeming,
and
we
want
to
do
so
in
a
reasonable
fashion.
to
hold
otherwise
is
really
a
repeal
of
17(d)
by
implication,
if
we
allow
the
secretary's
regulation
to
stand.
and
that,
i
think,
is
quite
a
dubious
proposition,
where
there
is
no
express
statutory
provision
overriding
it.
let
me
close
by
saying
that
iowa
is
interested
in
concentrating
its
resources
on
those
most
in
need.
that
is
the
name
of
medicaid.
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
passed.
and
a
reasonable
deeming
regulation
does
just
that.
it
avoids
the
prospect
of
having
lawyers
riding
circuit
across
the
state
trying
to
litigate
the
cases
that
were
disproved...
the
process
which
was
disproved
in
gray
panthers,
that
provides
that
relatively
wealthy
spouses
will
not
have
an
opportunity
to
slide
out
of
their
medicaid
obligations.
it
focuses
our
dollars.
and,
you
know,
whatever
the
financial
impact
is
on
this
case,
it
is
going
to
mean
there
is
less
money
for
something
else.
maybe
iowa
will
have
to
abandon
its
policy
of
having
optional
needy
with
medicaid.
maybe
iowa
goes
back
to
a
209(b)
state
if
the
pressures
get
so
great,
which
we
think
is
an
undesirable
policy,
because
of
the
lowered
eligibility,
and
because
of
the
impact
it
would
have
on
minor
children.
we
don't
want
to
be
a
209(b)
state,
emphatically.
but
we
think
that
the
policy
adopted
by
the
secretary
of
hhs
simply
is
contrary
to
the
statutory
framework.
it
is
contrary
to
17(d)
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
make
sense
in
terms
of
the
general
policy
of
deeming
since
family
obligations
continue
over
time.
they
don't
change
after
one
month.
they
remain
the
same.
administrative
enforcement
is
the
only
way
to
go.
this
is
a
case
of
ultra
vires
action
by
the
secretary,
not
a
case
of
line
drawing...
to
legislative
effect.
i
am
open
to
questions.
