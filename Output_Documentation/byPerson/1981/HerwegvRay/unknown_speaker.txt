mr.
dudovitz,
did
mrs.
herweg's
family
apply
on
her
behalf
for
ssi
benefits
before
applying
for
medicaid?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reason
why
no
application
was
made
on
her
behalf?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dudovitz,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
which
is,
if
we
were
to
reverse
in
this
case,
and
give
effect
to
the
secretary's
regulation,
would
states
still
be
able
to
collect
money
from
the
spouse
who
is
not
institutionalized
for
reimbursement
to
the
state
under
some
state
relative
responsibility
law,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
does
iowa
have
such
a
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dudovitz,
let
me
ask,
does
your
class
encompass
both
the
categorically
and
the
optional
categorically
needy?
unknown
speaker
does
the
regulation
that
was
struck
down
apply
only
to
the
optional
categorically
needy?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
example
that
you
are
giving,
of
course,
of
the
wealthy
non-institutionalized
spouse,
that
shouldn't
pose
such
a
problem,
should
it?
unknown
speaker
would
iowa
object
to
any
time
limitation
that
the
secretary
might
impose
on
deeming?
unknown
speaker
hasn't
congress
delegated
to
the
secretary,
though,
the
precise
power,
and
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
secretary's...
congress's
directive
has
been
effectively
ignored,
if
you
are
right?
unknown
speaker
general
appel,
we
haven't
heard
from
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
on
this
case,
have
we,
on
the
merits?
he
filed
a
brief
at
the
time
a
petition
for
cert
was
pending.
unknown
speaker
well,
general,
did
the
court
below
split
evenly?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
about
it
when
eight
judges
split
evenly
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
at
least
ambiguous?
and
if
it
is,
what
about
your
ultra
vires
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is,
do
you
leave
any
room
at
all
for
any
deference
to
the
secretary's
judgment
as
to
which
side
to
choose
on
this
ambiguity?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
must
not
be
ambiguous
then.
unknown
speaker
but
four
judges
below
are
against
you.
they
at
least
thought
it
was
sufficiently
ambiguous
to
vote
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
that
batterton
did
hold
that
the
original
judgment
was
for
the
secretary,
and
that
the
court
should
set
it
aside
only
if
it
was
unreasonable
or
irrational?
unknown
speaker
exceeded
statutory
authority,
not
simply
because
the
court
might
have
thought
it
would
come
down
with
a
different
regulation
if
it
had
been
entrusted
with
that
authority?
unknown
speaker
general
appel,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument?
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
same
deeming
regulation
is
used
to
determine
eligibility
for
ssi
benefits
as
for
the
medicaid
benefits?
the
one-month
rule,
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
that
it
is
arbitrary
in
the
case
of
medicaid
would
apply
also
to
eligibility
for
ssi
then,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
that
is
what
i
would
be
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
arguing
that
it
is
arbitrary
for
the
secretary
to
impose
that
requirement,
but
arguably
with
respect
to
ssi
congress
imposed
the
requirement
and
the
same
standard
of
arbitrariness
doesn't
apply
to
congress
as
it
does
to
the
secretary?
is
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--congress
can
act
arbitrarily,
but
the
secretary
can't.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
is
basically
what
you
are
saying
to
us.
unknown
speaker
because
if
it
is
arbitrary,
i
suppose
it
is
arbitrary
whoever
imposed
the
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
win
this
case,
i
take
it
that
iowa
couldn't
change
its
mind
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
as
long
as
it
is
a
209(b)
state,
it
may
not...
it
may
not
take
the
course
the
secretary
says
it
must
take?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
could
choose
to
do
it
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
could
choose
to
follow
the
ultra
vires
pattern?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
just
a
slightly
modified
version
of
justice
white's
question.
supposing
you
remain
an
ssi
state.
would
you
then
agree
that
you
could
not
adopt
new
regulations
that
are
precisely
like
the
secretary's
regulations?
unknown
speaker
you
could
not
do
that,
because
that
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
every
state--
--that
was
my
question.
thank
you
very
much.
and
every
state
in
the
country
that
has
followed
the
federal
regulation
has
invalid
regulations?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
every
ssi
state
that
has.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
going
to
cost
the
state
of
iowa
very
much.
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
point.
this
issue
isn't
going
to
cost
the
state
of
iowa
very
much
if
you
lose
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
lot
of
corn,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
depend
in
part
on
the
extent
to
which
iowa
is
willing
to
apply
its
own
relative
responsibility
laws
and
recoup
money?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
is
really
up
to
iowa
how
much
it
loses.
