justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
involves
the
eligibility
standards
for
the
medicaid
program
contained
within
the
social
security
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
the
day
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
uphold
federal
regulations
which
place
time
limitations
upon
the
authority
of
the
states
to
consider
the
income
of
an
institutionalized
medicaid
applicantâ€™s
spouse
when
determining
eligibility.
the
complexity
of
the
statutes
and
regulations
involved
virtually
defy
any
attempt
at
further
oral
exposition
and
i
shall
not
attempt
any.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
