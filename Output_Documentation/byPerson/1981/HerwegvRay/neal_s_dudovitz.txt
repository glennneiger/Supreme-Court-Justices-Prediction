mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
case
before
you
today
presents
this
court
with
familiar
concepts,
a
federal-state
cooperative
program,
federal
regulatory
issues,
and
specific
elements
of
the
medicaid
statute.
petitioners
are
a
class
of
poor
persons
from
the
state
of
iowa
who
are
being
deprived
of
medicaid
benefits
for
nursing
home
care
solely
because
iowa
has
chosen
to
disobey
federal
medicaid
regulations.
the
heart
of
the
medicaid
problem
here
involves
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
money
available
to
an
institutionalized
spouse
from
a
non-institutionalized
spouse
in
determining
benefit
eligibility.
this
process
is
called
deeming,
and
of
course
it
is
the
very
same
process
confronted
by
this
court
last
term
in
its
decision
in
schweiker
v.
gray
panthers.
whether
or
not
deeming
is
employed
for
spouses
separated
by
institutionalization
of
course
often
results
in
critical
life
decisions
for
members
of
the
petitioner
class.
as
a
majority
of
this
court
noted
in
gray
panthers,
many
individuals
in
need
of
medical
care
are
forced
by
deeming
to
choose
between
abandoning
an
institutionalized
spouse
and
living
in
poverty.
this
dilemma
is
at
the
core
of
the
present
controversy.
this
case,
like
that
in
gray
panthers,
revolves
around
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulations
that
determine
when
a
state
such
as
iowa
may
deem
income
between
spouses
separated
by
institutionalization.
contrary
to
the
plaintiffs
in
gray
panthers,
petitioners
in
this
case
are
not
attacking
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulations.
instead,
it
is
the
respondent
iowa
who
now
claims,
despite
their
acceptance
of
federal
moneys,
that
they
are
not
bound
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
iowa
argues
it
may
make
its
own
deeming
rules,
directly
contrary
to
the
federal
regulations,
and
still
be
reimbursed
by
the
federal
government
for
medicaid
payments.
petitioners
maintain,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
federal
regulations
are
a
valid
exercise
of
the
secretary's
authority
granted
to
him
by
congress,
and
the
federal
government,
as
stated
in
their
amicus
brief
filed
herein,
agrees
with
petitioners
that
iowa's
medicaid
rules
must
be
changed
in
order
to
comply
with
the
federal
regulations.
the
analysis
which
this
court
must
employ
in
evaluating
this
controversy
was
set
forth
by
the
court
in
its
decision
last
term
in
gray
panthers.
the
regulations
at
issue
in
this
case
are
promulgated
under
the
exact
same
statutory
authority
for
which
the
regulations
of
gray
panthers
were
promulgated.
in
the
gray
panthers
case,
this
court
ruled
that
the
section
of
the
medicaid
act
under
which
the
secretary
was
acting
both
in
gray
panthers
and
here
amounted
to
congress's
granting
to
the
secretary
the
power
to
make
regulations
that
have
legislative
effect.
the
court
therefore
applied
its
previous
decision
in
batterton
v.
francis,
in
order
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
regulations.
the
batterton
test
requires
that
the
regulations
be
upheld
unless
they
are
either
arbitrary
or
capricious,
or
beyond
the
authority
granted
the
secretary
by
congress.
it
is
important
to
note
that
neither
the
district
court
in
this
case
nor
judge
ross
writing
for
half
of
the
eighth
circuit
followed
the
batterton
test.
the
only
group
of
judges
that
did
was
the
second
half
of
the
eighth
circuit,
in
an
opinion
written
by
judge
mcmillian,
who
followed
the
batterton
test,
and
came
out
on
the
same
side
as
petitioners
are
herein,
indicating
that
the
regulations
must
stand
and
iowa's
rules
must
fall.
the
practical
implications
of
the
batterton-gray
panther
test
are
that
this
court
must
focus
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
regulations.
it
is
not
the
duty
of
this
court
to
interpret
the
statute
to
see
if
there
is
another
way
to
read
the
statutes,
nor
is
it
the
duty
of
this
court
under
batterton
and
gray
panthers
to
compare
iowa's
interpretation
or
the
secretary's
to
determine
whose
might
seem
most
reasonable.
the
question
is
not
really
whether
iowa's
policy
is
reasonable,
which
is
what
iowa
seems
to
want
to
argue
to
this
court.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
secretary's
regulations
are
reasonable.
if
they
are,
then
they
must
stand,
and
iowa
must
be
forced
to
follow
them.
the
gray
panthers
decision
is
not,
however,
controlling
on
the
ultimate
merits
of
this
case,
for
the
reason
that
the
regulations
at
stake
in
gray
panthers
ultimately
did
not
apply
to
the
state
of
iowa.
under
the
statutory
authority
of
the
medicaid
act
that
we
are
concerned
with,
the
secretary
issued,
in
a
sense,
two
sets
of
regulations,
one
that
applied
to
states
which
have
been
called
the
209(b)
states,
and
another
set
of
regulations
that
apply
to
the
ssi
states.
at
stake
in
gray
panthers
were
the
regulations
applicable
to
the
209(b)
states,
at
stake
here
are
the
regulations
applicable
to
the
ssi
states.
that
distinction
is
what
produces
the
critical
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
the
record
reflects
that
she
did
not
apply
before,
and
i
think
the
briefs
will
note
that
there
is
some
question
about
whether
or
not
she
in
fact
ever
was
an
ssi
recipient.
however,
the
court
will
note
that
attached
to
the
appendix
in
this
case
is
the
decision
of
the
iowa
department
of
social
services
on
the
herwegs,
and
they
note
in
that
decision
that
as
of
june...
they
had
received
notice
that
as
of
june,
1977,
she
was
going
to
receive
ssi.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
i
actually
do
not
know
the
answer
to
why
she
did
not
make
an
application.
it
is
my
understanding
that
she
would
have
been
eligible
after
the
first
month
that
she
moved
out
of
the
home.
the
difference
between
the
209(b)
and
ssi
distinctions,
as
i
said,
is
critical
here.
the
209(b)
option,
as
this
court
noted
in
gray
panthers,
was
created
by
congress
essentially
at
the
behest
of
the
states
because
the
states
did
not
want
to
be
bound
by
what
we
have
called
the
ssi
link.
that
link,
that
part
of
the
statute,
1396(a)(10)(a),
requires
that
a
state
provide
medicaid
benefits
to
all
ssi
recipients.
this
link
to
categorical
programs,
that
is,
linking
medicaid
eligibility
to
eligibility
for
categorical
programs,
was
not
new.
it
has
essentially
existed
in
the
medicaid
program
from
its
inception.
the
critical
difference,
though,
that
occurred
in
1972
was
the
adoption
by
congress
of
the
ssi
program.
prior
to
that
time,
the
states
were
able
to
control
many
of
the
eligibility
conditions
for
the
categorical
programs.
therefore,
to
link
eligibility
to
those
programs
did
not...
still
allowed
the
states
to
have
substantial
control
over
the
eligibility
conditions.
by
federalizing
the
age,
blind,
and
disabled
in
ssi,
congress
created
the
eligibility
conditions
for
supplemental
security
income.
that
would
have
resulted
in
some
states,
if
the
link
had
been
continued
to
apply
to
them,
having
to
pay
medicaid
benefits
to
people
they
had
not
paid
them
to
before.
in
order
to
not
force
the
states
to
have
to
do
this,
congress
provided
the
209(b)
option,
which
allowed
states
to
use
its
eligibility
conditions
that
were
in
existence
in
january,
1972,
rather
than
be
bound
by
the
ssi
rules.
states
had
a
voluntary
choice
to
make.
iowa
chose
to
be
bound
by
the
ssi
rules.
iowa
chose
to
follow
the
ssi
rules
for
medicaid
eligibility,
as,
of
course,
did
a
majority
of
the
states.
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
link
then
assures
that
all
ssi
people,
all
people
who
are
so
poor
that
they
need
cash
assistance,
will
also
get
corresponding
medical
benefits,
and
it
attaches
to
medicaid
the
eligibility
conditions
for
those
benefits
that
congress
crafted
in
the
ssi
statute.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
yes,
absolutely.
the
medicaid
rules
here
and
the
ssi
rules
say
nothing
about
the
state's
powers
under
its
relative
responsibility
laws.
in
fact,
the
secretary
has
noted
a
number
of
times
that
the
states
are
free
to
exercise
their
rights,
whatever
they
may
be,
under
those
laws.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
it
is
my
understanding
iowa
does
have
such
a
law.
the
particular
ssi
eligibility
rules
that
are
being
brought
to
the
medicaid
program
through
the
link
here,
the
deeming
rules,
are
simply
that
spouses
when
they
live
together
must
have
their
income
included
together,
and
when
only
one
spouse
is
an
eligible
spouse,
there
is
only
one
spouse
is
applying
for
benefits,
that
deeming
must
cease
after
the
first
month.
when
two
spouses
are
applying,
ssi
requires
that
their
income
be
considered
together
for
six
months,
and
correspondingly,
the
secretary
requires
that
same
six-month
deeming
in
the
medicaid
program.
iowa
admittedly
does
not
follow
that
rule,
and
admits
that
they
are
directly
and
specifically
in
violation
of
those
regulations.
the
secretary's
regulations,
then,
in
our
view,
when
evaluated,
that
is,
that
regulation
bringing
the
one
month
and
six
month
rule
over
from
ssi
to
medicaid,
when
evaluated
under
the
batterton-gray
panthers
test
which
this
court
has
established
balance
the
overall
policies
of
the
medicaid
program,
that
is,
the
attached...
assuring
that
categorical
eligible
people,
ssi
people,
get
medicaid,
with
section
17(b)
and
(d)
of
the
medicaid
act,
that
give
the
secretary
the
power
to
determine
what
income
is
available
and
talk
about
the
limited
exception
to
deeming
for
spouses
and
parents
to
children.
the
regulations
recognize
therefore
that
section
(d),
the
authorization
for
the
limited
deeming,
and
i
think
it
is
important
again
to
note
that
this
court
recognize
that
congress
generally
was
opposed
to
deeming
but
allowed
a
limited
exception,
recognize
that
(d)
is
such
a
limited
exception,
but
it
also
recognized
that
the
subsequent
enactment
by
congress
of
the
ssi
program
in
1972
amounted
to
a
modification
of
section
(d),
such
that
(d)
could
not
be
used
to
deprive
ssi
recipients
of
benefits.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
yes,
it
does.
there
is
no
distinction
in
the
class
between
the
two.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
regulation
would
apply
to
everyone
about
the
ssi
recipients
and
the
optionals.
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
as
i
think
both
our
brief
and
the
brief
the
federal
government
points
out,
that
the
optional
categorical
people
are
in
effect
categorical
people,
and
that
the
federal
government
has
always
applied
the
same
rules
to
all
of
them,
and
the
secretary
has
always
understood
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
they
be
treated
the
same,
again,
recognizing
that
the
optionals
was
a
voluntary
choice
by
the
state
of
iowa.
they
did
not
have
to
choose
to
cover
those
people,
but
that
was
their
choice
to
do
so.
the
secretary's
regulations
then
are
no
more
restrictive
than
the
ssi
deeming
rules
which
the
same
states
have
to
use,
and
it
is
in
our
view
the
only
way
to
assure
that
the
ssi
link
has
effect.
iowa,
to
our
knowledge,
is
by
itself
in
its
interpretation
of
these
rules
and
statutes.
the
only
other
state
to
our
knowledge
that
has
ever
argued
that
they
can
ignore
these
deeming
rules
was
the
state
of
florida,
and
as
i
think
we
noted
in
our
briefs,
in
the
griswold
case
the
federal
district
judge
enjoined
florida
from
undertaking
their
view.
the
federal
government
has
always
agreed
with
the
position
of
the
petitioners.
simply
that...
the
simple
question
is,
if
iowa
can
do
what
it
is
trying
to
do
here,
if
it
can
be
an
ssi
state,
but
then
pick
and
choose
which
ssi
rules
it
wants
to
use
in
the
medicaid
program,
it
effectively
emasculates
the
link
and
deprives
the
federal
government
of
any
opportunity
to
control
the
medicaid
program,
for
which
it
is
the
primary
funder.
another
interesting
point
in
this
case
is
that
again
if
you
look
at
the
department
of
social
services'
decision
attached
to
the
appendix
in
this
case,
you
will
note
that
there
were
two
federal
ssi
rules
brought
over
to
the
medicaid
program
which
were
at
stake
initially
in
the
herweg
case.
one
was
the
deeming
question,
and
the
other
was
the
income
disregards
question.
that
is,
how
much
of
mr.
herweg's
income
would
be
disregarded
under
the
ssi
rules.
iowa
chose
to
change
that
also
initially,
but
in
its
decision
on
the
herwegs'
case,
it
reversed
itself.
it
said,
we
are
bound
to
follow
the
ssi
income
rules
for
the
herwegs.
therefore,
we
have
to
use
the
ssi
exemptions,
but
we
are
not
bound
to
follow
the
ssi
deeming
rules.
petitioners
submit
that
makes
no
sense
under
a
federal-state
cooperative
program.
iowa
has
made
a
few
arguments
that
i
wish
to
deal
with
on
this
point.
one,
they
have
implied
that
there
is
somehow
some
inherent
power
in
the
state
of
iowa
to
do
deeming
through
the
medicaid
program.
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
iowa's
inherent
power
to
the
extent
it
exists
is
found
in
the
relative
responsibility
laws.
the
medicaid
program
is
a
federal-state
cooperative
program.
iowa
doesn't
have
any
inherent
powers
there.
what
a
federal-state
cooperative
program
does
is,
congress
says
that
these
are
the
rules.
if
you
want
to
use
federal
money,
you
have
to
agree
to
follow
the
rules,
and
congress
determines
who
has
the
power
to
set
the
rules.
it
seems
clear
here
that
they
have
given
the
secretary
the
power
in
this
area.
section
17(d)
is
not
mandatory,
and
again
is
modified
by
congress's
subsequent
enactment
of
the
link.
i
think
it
is
again
important
to
recognize
that
in
evaluating
federal-state
cooperative
programs
like
the
medicaid
program
and
the
afdc
program,
this
court
must
look
at
the
overall
policy
and
intent
of
congress,
as
justice
rehnquist
noted
in
the
filberg
case.
it
is
not
just
one
sentence
or
one
word
that
is
important
here.
it
is
the
entire
overall
policy.
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
overall
policy
is
to
ensure
that
ssi
recipients
receive
medicaid.
the
second
major
point
that
i
think
iowa
tries
to
make
is,
they
try
to
argue
that
the
ssi
program
does
not
actually
require
that
there
be
no
deeming
after
one
month,
and
they
imply
that
that
is
in
fact
the
secretary's
idea
rather
than
congress's.
in
ssi,
however,
congress
specifically
in
statute
set
forth
in
great
detail
most
of
the
eligibility
rules.
not
only
did
they
talk
about
only
deeming
in
one-month
and
six-month
times,
but
in
section
1382(a)(2),
where
they
define
unearned
income
once
people
are
separate,
for
people,
or
for
all
persons,
i
should
say,
including
when
people
are
separated,
they
indicated
that
support
and
maintenance
can
be
considered
unearned
income
only
if
supplied
in
cash
or
in
kind.
it
is
not
the
secretary,
but
it
is
congress
that
set
forth
these
ssi
deeming
rules
that
the
secretary
has
now
brought
over
to
the
medicaid
program
by
virtue
of
the
link
and
his
authority
under
17(b).
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
secretary,
balancing
all
these
interests,
to
use
congress's
enacted
eligibility
conditions
in
the
medicaid
program
as
a
way
to
effectuate
the
link.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
yes.
i
would
like
to
just
clarify
a
couple
of
points,
your
honor.
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
nobody
has
mandated
anything
on
the
state
of
iowa.
there
are
lots
of
choices.
and
point
out
a
point
that
i
think
was
neglected
a
second
ago,
that
while
iowa
can
become
a
209(b)
state,
and
they
can
have
more
liberal
eligibility
rules
than
they
had
in
1972,
they
just
cannot
have
any
more
restrictive
rules,
so
iowa's
209(b)
program
isn't
specifically
mandated
to
be
exactly
as
it
was
in
1972.
it
just
can't
be
more
restrictive.
so
if
they
want
to
add
a
few
more
people
under
the
209(b)
program,
they
absolutely
can.
secondly,
i
would
note
again
that
section
17(d)
is
not
mandatory.
section
17(d)
is
permissive,
and
the
problem
in
the
gray
panthers
case
was,
the
argument
was
being
made
that
there
could
be
no
deeming
in
the
medicaid
program.
what
this
court
held
is
that
the
secretary
must
allow
at
times
that
there
be
deeming.
the
second
important
distinction
is,
what
we
were
dealing
with
or
what
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
the
gray
panthers
decision
and
interpreting
(b)
and
(d)
was
that
congress
intended
in
1965,
when
it
enacted
the
medicaid
program.
again,
congress
modified
the
medicaid
program
a
number
of
times,
particularly
in
1972,
when
they
dealt
with
the
change
of
the
link
and
how
its
effect
is
on
the
ssi
program.
by
doing
that,
essentially,
congress
almost
in
some
sense
said
that
the
legislative
history
at
the
time
(b)
and
(d)
were
adopted
did
not
quite
have
the
same
meaning.
so
even
if
it
might
have
been
stronger
in
1965,
the
requirement
of
the
link
to
the
ssi
program,
which
no
one
seems
to
deny
here,
essentially
modifies
it.
it
makes
it
clear
the
secretary
is
reasonable
in
saying,
look,
you
can
deem
sometimes.
and
remember,
iowa
can
deem
sometimes.
in
fact,
it
can
deem
to
the
extent
that
the
congress
found
it
reasonable
to
deem
in
the
ssi
program,
a
program
for
poor
people,
so
that
the
wealthy
spouse
that
my
brother
talked
about
would
in
fact
get
ssi.
that
what
the
secretary
did
is
make
a
reasonable
balance
between
the
needs
of
the
link,
the
permissiveness
of
(d)
but
not
the
mandatory
nature
of
(d).
and
in
that
conjunction
i
want
to
point
out
again
that
it
is
not
the
secretary
who
set
up
those
deeming
rules
in
ssi.
it
is
congress.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
question
of
a
secretary
so-called
misinterpreting
the
ssi
deeming
rules,
and
i
refer
again
to
section
1382(a)(2)(a),
which
is
the
definition
of
unearned
income
in
determining
eligibility
for
an
ssi
recipient,
enacted
by
congress,
which
indicates
that
you
cannot
consider
support
and
maintenance
unless
provided
in
cash
or
in
kind.
finally,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
distinct
difference,
i
think,
between
the
arguments
that
were
being
made
in
gray
panthers
and
the
arguments
that
were
being
made
here
with
regard
to
state
relative
responsibility
laws.
what
this
court
was
addressing
in
gray
panthers
when
it
noted
the
inadequacy
of
the
relative
responsibility
law
was
the
argument
that
the
gray
panthers
had
made
that
the
relative
responsibility
laws
are
the
only
mechanism,
and
when
the
court
made
a
notation
to
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
that
counsel
had
acknowledged
the
difficulty
of
getting
relief
to
the
relative
responsibility,
counsel
was
talking
about
those
close
cases
where
it
would
be
just
as
difficult,
in
fact,
very
difficult
to
expect
a
state
to
order
it.
in
the
situation
of
a
wealthy
spouse,
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
enforce
the
relative
responsibility
laws,
and
the
relative
responsibility
laws
we
are
talking
about
here
are
in
addition
to,
not
the
only
remedy,
and
that
is,
a
state
can
still
do
deeming
under
medicaid
for
the
one-month
and
six-month
period,
and
in
addition
has
its
relative
responsibility
laws
for
remedy.
so
that
there
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
distinct
difference
between
the
problem
that
this
court
was
referring
to
in
its
notation
in
gray
panthers.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
any
other
questions,
your
honor.
