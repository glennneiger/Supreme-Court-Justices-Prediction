chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman,
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
princeton
university
and
new
jersey
against
schmid.
mr.
katzenbach,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
princeton
made
an
imprudent
decision
to
accept
the
invitation
to
intervene
instead
of
declining
that
and
volunteering
to
file
a
brief
amicus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
new
regulation
was
a
response
to
this
case,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
to
--
to
the
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
new
jersey
constitution
or
law
or
the
federal
constitution
to
prevent
princeton
from
putting
a
20-foot
wall
around
and,
in
fact,
making
it
like
a
monastery
of
the
middle
ages
if
they
wanted
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
make
it
an
8-foot
wall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
a
gm
has
a
plant
in
new
jersey,
it
derives
its
authority
in
some
way
from
the
states,
either
as
a
foreign
corporation
doing
business
or
a
new
jersey
corporation,
if
so,
would
they
fall
under
this
band
that
has
been
discussed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
they
could
say,
“we're
making
automobiles
here,
not
speeches”.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levinson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure.
i
--
i
attacked
you
on
these
illustrations
because
there
are
public
streets
running
through
all
of
the
campuses,
i
think
of
that
have
been
mentioned.
i'm
not
so
sure
about
georgetown.
but
take
it
as
a
hypothetical
campus
which
is
one
square
mile
or
a
half
square
mile,
entirely
college
property,
no
public
streets,
and
private
highways
and
sidewalks
running
through
them.
now,
this
is
operated
by
an
order
of
the
catholic
church.
are
you
telling
us
that
they
must
permit
people
to
come
on
there
and
make
speeches
advocating
abortion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
change
my
hypothetical
from
advocacy
of
abortion
to
advocacy
of
marxism.
it
eliminates
the
free
exercise.
must
they
allow
on
marxist
to
--
from
a
soviet
union
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
come
over
and
say
why
we
should
convert
to
marxism.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
was
asking
a
hypothetical
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
test
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
katzenbach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
80-1576,
princeton
university
and
new
jersey
against
schmid
in
a
concurring
opinion
--
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
dismissed.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
