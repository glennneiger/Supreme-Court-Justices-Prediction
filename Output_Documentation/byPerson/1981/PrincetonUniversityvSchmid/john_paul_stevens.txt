--
justice
john
paul

you
heard
our
colloquy
about
mootness
in
the
last
case.
is
there
not
a
similarity
between
this
case
and
that
you've
now
adopted
a
regulation
that
would
have
permitted
this
man
to
come
on
and
distribute
leaflets
for
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
--
is
that
a
test
or
is
it
--
if
he
did
precisely
the
same
thing
he
did
here
that
gave
rise
to
the
trespass
prosecution,
do
we
now
violate
your
present
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
katzenbach
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
katzenbach,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
with
the
test
they
proposed
might
lead
to
situations
in
which
the
intruder
makes
an
expression
that's
offensive
to
what
the
university
wants
to
express
and
thereby
offend
the
university's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
rights
to
expression.
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
is
the
basis
for
suggesting
that
what
mr.
schmid
did
had
any
conflict
whatsoever
with
any
expressive
policy
of
the
university?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
we
have
anything
before
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
reason
the
case
is
here
is
because,
if
you
lose,
he
can
go
back
and
do
exactly
the
same
thing
all
over
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
does
that
interfere
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
that
interfere
with
anything
that
you
want
to
do
with
your
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
this
limited
thing
that
he's
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
that's
a
fair
statement
there
in
the
opinion.
isn't
the
opinion
the
equivalent
of
a
new
jersey
statute
that's
said
in
effect,
“unless
a
university
adapts
regulations
that
contain
standards
for
inviting
people
to
come
under
their
campus,
reasonable
standard,
then
it
must
allow
a
certain
number
of
people
to
come
on
for
a
limited
purpose.”
it
doesn't
say,
anybody
can
come
on
whenever
they
want
to
and
it
does
say
that
if
you
adapt
regulations
that
are
reasonable,
you
may
--
there
--
there
may
be
no
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
--
i
don't
know
exactly
what
they
mean
but
they
say
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
say
--
it
contained
no
standards
aside
from
the
requirement
for
invitation
from
--
they
say
you
had
no
standards
whatsoever.
and
they
say,
in
a
standardless
case,
you
lose,
but
once
you've
got
standard,
presumably,
the
court
would
take
a
look
at
the
standards.
because
the
case
as
it
came
to
them
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
standard,
as
i
understand
it
was
permission.
so
it
was
essentially
no
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
say
you
got
to
do
something
more
than
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
then
they
would
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
say
that
if
you
want
to
operate
a
university
and
to
say
that
the
legislature
passed
such
a
statute
that
said,
“until
you
pass
some
kind
of
a
--
of
a
regulation,
you
must
let
people
on
for
reasonable
expressive
activities.”
would
that
be
an
unconstitutional
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
i
guess
you
have
to
be
arguing
that,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
got
to
do
--
are
private
universities
in
new
jersey
subject
to
any
kind
of
certification
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levinson,
they
haven't
repudiated
their
position
that
they
have
they
--
the
man
has
to
ask
to
come
on
the
campus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
rules
were
before
the
judgment
though.
these
rules
were
drafted
before
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
they
said
that.
at
least
they
said
that
those
rules
didn't
affect
this
case
because
this
case
arose
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
rules.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
really
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
new
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that
if
the
same
problem
arose
again
maybe
princeton
would
win.
