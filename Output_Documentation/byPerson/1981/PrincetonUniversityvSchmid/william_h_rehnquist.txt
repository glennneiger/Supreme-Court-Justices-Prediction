justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
katzenbach,
doesn't
it
also
involve
whether
princeton
should
be
here
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily,
in
a
state
prosecution
to
address
this,
the
matter
is
tried
in
the
criminal
courts
and
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
said,
â€œalthough
we
think
perhaps
the
federal
constitution
would
not
prohibit
trespass.
we
interpret
our
state
constitution
to
forbid
this
type
of
prosecution.
so,
the
indictment
is
dismissed
or
the
prisoner
free.
and
then
how
--
how
does
princeton
get
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
that
mean
you're
here,
too,
as
well
as
in
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
couldn't
say
of
the
same
of
the
city
of
mesquite
that
they
decided
they
would
be
better
to
repeal
a
part
of
their
ordinance
than
to
try
and
enforce
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
new
jersey
required
to
respect
private
property
at
all
except
under
the
eminent
domain
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
respect
private
or
set
up
a
system
of
private
property
at
all,
except
under
the
eminent
domain
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
well,
assume
that
there
--
there
are
no
--
the
state
does
not
pass
any
trespass
statute
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
it
doesn't
provide
for
any
recorder
of
deeds
and
it
simply
says
all
lands
shall
be
held
in
common
by
the
residents
of
a
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
it
had
started
out
that
way,
wouldn't
be
a
taking?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
katzenbach,
you
said
a
moment
ago,
if
princeton
is
to
be
reduced
to
the
status
of
a
governmental
body
like
new
jersey,
actually
princeton
is
in
a
sense
a
creature
of
new
jersey,
is
it
not?
it
has
--
doesn't
have
a
charter
from
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
--
i
mean
isn't
it
in
a
sense
of
business
or
a
private
institution
that
is
regulated
by
the
laws
of
the
state
subject
to
any
constitutional
provisions
of
the
u.s.
constitution
there
--
to
the
contrary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
new
jersey
couldn't
allow
a
police
officer
to
come
on
the
princeton
campus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
--
it
is
said
that
it
will
stay
the
hand
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
prosecuting
schmid,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
the
holding
was
it
would
--
it
would
stay
the
hand
of
the
prosecutors
in
new
jersey
from
prosecuting
schmid
under
an
ordinance
for
trespass.
