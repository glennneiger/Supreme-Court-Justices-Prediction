mr.
sanford
levinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ultimate
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
is
simple,
whether
princeton
university
has
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
compel
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
violate
its
own
constitution
by
applying
its
criminal
law
to
convict
chris
schmid
of
criminal
trespass
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
that
is
the
one
judgment
before
this
court.
princeton
university,
we
began
by
arguing
has
two
obstacles
to
run
before
this
court
can
even
reach
a
decision
on
the
merits.
the
first
is
jurisdictional
and
i
do
not
propose
to
take
much
of
your
time
because
you
have
addressed
that
issue
in
your
own
questions
and
we
brief
that
extensively.
mr.
sanford
levinson
that
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
that
would
certainly
be
one
plausible
reading
of
right
duties.
mr.
sanford
levinson
that
is
a
potential
issue.
a
potential
issue
is
whether
new
jersey
could
sue
schmid
subsequently
though
i
hasten
to
point
out
that
we
do
not
challenge
the
existing
regulations
of
princeton
university
and
schmid
and
his
political
cohorts
have
been
on
the
university
campus
following
the
rules.
there's
no
objection.
we
argue
that
this
case
is
moot.
but
one
other
way
of
generating
a
case
would
be
to
file
a
civil
suit
against
schmid
or
someone
similar
for
civil
trespass
and
go
backup
the
new
jersey
courts.
this
is
a
final
judgment
from
a
criminal
conviction.
there
are
$15.00
and
$10.00
court
costs
at
stake.
princeton
university
will
not
receive
the
(inaudible)
indeed,
one
of
the
issues
of
this
case
is
what
would
happen
if
the
court
reverses
the
new
jersey
opinion.
new
jersey
is
not
at
the
counsel's
table.
they
make
no
request
for
their
$15.00.
they
specifically
disaffirm
in
their
brief,
a
desire
for
the
$15.00.
the
rules
have
changed.
what
is
princeton
asking
for
other
than
an
advisory
opinion
that
at
a
time
three
and
a
half
years
ago
they
could
do
what
they
have
subsequently
repudiated?
it's
an
interesting
question
to
be
sure
but
not
a
question
which
provokes
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
mr.
sanford
levinson
we
don't
challenge
that,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
levinson
they
are
barred
from
having
a
--
they
are
barred
presumably.
i
confess
that
were
they
to
sue
in
tort
under
the
old
rules
of
absolutely
standardless,
in
fact
to
say
non-rule
it
set
unless
we
give
you
permission
and
we
will
not
tell
you
why
we
will
or
will
not
give
permission.
if
you
are
an
uninvited
stranger,
you
can't
get
on
campus.
that
was
the
old
so-called
rule.
it
is
true
that
the
most
plausible
reading
from
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
is
what
your
honor
suggested
from
questioning
to
mr.
katzenbach.
mr.
sanford
levinson
because
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
yes,
sir.
but
the
rules
were
changed
prior
to
determination
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
--
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
mr.
sanford
levinson
the
prohibition
--
i
think
it
is
true
that
if
princeton
have
not
changed
its
rules
at
all
not
only
with
the
trespass
law
not
be
enforceable
but
certainly,
he
would
argue
that
a
tort
suit
would
be
equally
unenforceable.
but
princeton
did
change
its
rules
well
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
decision.
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
effect
to
declare
the
present
new
jersey
rules
perfectly
constitutional
under
the
constitution
of
new
jersey
and
we
do
not
challenge
that.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
sanford
levinson
yes,
sir,
that's
right,
justice
stevens
but
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
they
did
not
legally
pass
on
the
validity
in
the
sense
of
declaring
that
the
rules
are
constitutional
but
i
think
the
most
plausible
reading
of
that
particular
opinion
is
that
the
new
rules
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
rules
that
would
pass
master
in
a
proper
case.
mr.
sanford
levinson
oh,
yes,
in
new
jersey
under
the
existing
rules
of
princeton
university.
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
doubt
about
that.
we
would
add
one
case
to
this
court's
attention,
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief
that
is
the
university
of
--
regents
of
the
university
of
texas
systems
versus
new
left
education
project,
414
u.s.
at
807
where
the
university
of
texas
in
the
midst
of
litigation
about
rules
quite
astonishingly
similar
to
the
instant
rules
changed
the
rules.
this
court
with
only
justice
douglas
expressing
some
reservations
in
a
one-paragraph
opinion
ordered
the
court
below
to
dismiss
the
case
as
moot.
that
precedent
ought
to
be
followed
here.
it
would
dispose
of
all
issues
in
the
most
economic
way
possible.
the
second
obstacle
to
this
case
has
not
been
addressed
by
princeton
of
--
in
their
briefs
or
in
oral
argument
and
that
is
flagg
brothers
versus
brooks,
which
we
argue
would
have
to
be
overruled
for
at
least
seriously
limited
in
order
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
case.
where
is
the
state
action
in
a
state
refusing
to
use
its
trespass
law
to
punish
somebody
for
conduct?
flagg
brothers
stands
for
the
following
proposition.
state
action
exists
if
and
only
if
the
state
--
the
action
can
be
attributed
to
the
state.
action
is
attributed
to
the
state
if
it
orders
conduct
or
indeed,
if
it
encourages
conduct.
chris
schmid
was
not
ordered
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
enter
the
princeton
campus.
chris
schmid
was
not
encouraged
by
the
state
from
new
jersey
to
enter
princeton's
campus.
it
was
an
entirely
private
decision
on
his
part
and
what
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
said
is
that
it
will
stay
the
hand
of
state
institutions
in
regard
to
such
private
conduct.
that
is
the
meaning,
i
believe,
of
the
majority
decision
in
flagg
brothers
versus
brooks.
i
will
add
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
sanford
levinson
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
but
under
flagg
brothers,
we
would
argue
that
is
not
the
kind
for
state
action
which
princeton
can
assert
that
if
this
case
is
properly
styled
as
princeton
university
versus
schmid,
princeton
university
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
on
the
appellant
side
which
is
the
style
for
this
case.
what
princeton
university
must
show
is
state
action
residing
in
appellee
schmid
and
there
is
no
such
state
action.
perhaps,
princeton
university
has
an
argument
with
the
state
of
new
jersey
obviously.
princeton
university
has
an
argument
with
the
state
of
new
jersey
but
it
would
say
that's
it's
precisely
the
kind
of
argument
held
by
brooks
with
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
could
allow
of
the
garage
in
that
case
to
sell
the
property
without
first
running
a
hearing.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
state
action.
under
power
of
a
state
law,
yes,
state
action,
no.
that
we
feel
is
a
serious
problem
facing
the
court
should
it
reach
the
merits
of
this
case.
in
all
candor,
i
might
say
that
appellee
schmid
would
endorse
the
overruling
of
flagg
brothers
verus
brooks
in
returning
indeed
to
logan
valley
because
that
would
make
state
actions
what
princeton
asks
for.
the
use
of
coercive
state
processes
to
punish
a
person
for
exercising
free
speech
rights.
we
do
not
argue
that
if
you
find
state
action,
schmid
loses.
we
argue
that
schmid
wins
either
way.
but
flagg
bothers
must
be
addressed
both
by
appellant
princeton
and
by
this
court
if
their
claims
on
the
merits
are
to
be
reached
at
all.
in
the
pruneyard
case,
neither
of
the
parties
briefed
the
issue.
there
is
one
mention
of
flagg
brothers
in
one
footnote
of
an
amicus
opinion
and
therefore,
this
court
cannot
address
the
issue.
it
easily
submits
a
fresh
issue
before
this
court
on
what
the
implications
of
flagg
brothers
are
for
cases
like
this
one.
we
therefore
move
to
the
issue
on
the
merits
where
we
obviously
are
willing
to
defend
of
a
highly
differential
new
jersey
state
decision,
a
decision
differential
to
the
interest
of
princeton
university
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors
points
out
at
length,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
took
full
recognition
of
the
legitimate
rights
of
princeton
university.
what
they
correctly
found
is
that
princeton
university
presented
no
reason
whatsoever
to
keep
schmid
off
its
campus
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
a
strong
tradition
in
support
of
political
speech.
that
is
not
only
the
rational
interest
but
we
would
argue
if
need
be
the
compelling
state
interest
that
the
state
sought.
the
brief
mentions
of
the
republican
forms
of
government
clause
that
is
obviously
not
judicially
enforceable
by
this
court
going
back
--
back
to
luther
versus
borden.
but
we
would
argue
that
the
republican
forms
of
government
clause
points
to
the
essential
underpinning
of
what
our
system
of
government
is
about
which
is
a
free
relatively
unrestricted,
relatively
unstructured
public
dialogue.
and
that
is
what
the
state
of
new
jersey,
the
very
state
protected
even
if
not
of
--
protected
by
judicial
enforcement,
protected
in
the
federal
constitution
and
surely
a
state
supreme
court
can
construe
its
own
state
constitution
to
protect
those
basic
republican
institutions
of
our
society.
and
that's
what
they
did
in
this
case
taking
full
measure
of
every
interest
that
princeton
university
could
properly
put
before
it.
and
thus
we
argue
--
we
would
be
delighted
if
this
court
reached
the
merits
in
spite
of
the
jurisdictional
and
state
action
hurdles
because
it
would
seem
inconceivable
that
a
state
could
not
act
so
as
to
protect
the
political
dialogue.
in
pruneyard
versus
robins,
united
states
participated
in
oral
argument
before
this
court
to
point
out
its
grave
reservations
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
should
the
shopping
center
be
upheld
in
that
case.
similar
issues
are
present
here.
what
princeton
university
argues
on
page
eight
of
its
reply
brief
and
in
oral
argument
this
afternoon
is
that
there
is,
“the
right
of
a
private
university
to
determine
its
educational
policy.”
with
educational
policy
being
whatever
is
defined
as
such
by
princeton
or
any
other
university.
this
point
has
also
made
it
like
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors.
what
if
the
policy
which
you
referred
the
special
authority
of
white
males
by
hiring
only
white
males
to
teach?
indeed,
what
if
in
furtherance
of
some
notion
having
alleged
educational
policy
princeton
sought
to
use
new
jersey
trespass
law
in
the
context
with
attempting
to
keep
up
uninvited
blacks
though
issuing
a
generous
invitation
to
all
whites
and
to
invited
blacks.
could
new
jersey
truly
not
refuse
its
aid
or
does
the
constitution
compel
that
giving
over
of
public
power
to
such
indefensible
private
ends.
the
bob
jones
case
will
be
before
this
court
later
in
this
term
and
raises
serious
constitutional
issues
for
the
constitutional
issues
are
those
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
if
princeton
university
hang
before
this
court
arguing
that
presbyterian
doctrine
forced
the
policy
adapted
in
1978,
that
would
present
a
truly
challenging
question
of
constitutional
law.
that
does
not
raise
questions
of
academic
freedom
at
all
however.
it
raises
questions
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion
and
issues
blessedly
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
neither
the
holding
nor
the
opinion
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
reaches
this
far
as
princeton
would
have
us
believe.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
extremely
narrow
in
its
holding
after
a
careful
and
detailed
examination
of
the
relationship
between
schmid's
speech
interest
and
the
actual
policy
operation
from
princeton
university
had
found
schmid's
interest
more
weighty.
so
a
vague
recognition
of
the
narrowness
of
the
holding
below,
princeton
constantly
asks
this
court
in
its
brief
and
in
its
argument
to
decide
cases
not
before
it
even
as
plausible
hypotheticals.
on
the
other
hand,
all
of
the
arguments
put
forth
in
our
argument
are
all
too
plausible
because
princeton
university
has
not
offered
and
cannot
offer
a
cogent
distinction
between
what
it
asks
for
in
this
case
and
any
future
request
to
be
exempt
from
the
most
basic
statutes
found
necessary
by
congress,
state
legislatures
or
the
people
of
the
state
acting
through
their
constitutive
document
in
order
to
provide
elemental
social
justice.
one
final
argument
must
be
addressed
more
before
by
conclusion
and
that
is
the
purported
use
by
the
court
below
of
inadmissible
content
distinctions.
the
court
below
does
argue
with
distinguished
among
categories
of
speech
but
so
of
course
does
this
court.
for
example,
political
speech
versus
commercial
speech,
not
to
mention
offensive
speech
or
obscene
speech.
categorical
distinctions,
whatever
the
difficulties
are
wholly
different
from
genuine
content
distinctions
which
say
that
for
example
within
a
given
category
certain
speech
is
acceptable
while
other
speech
is
not.
one
cannot
say
for
example
that
political
speech
about
domestic
policy
is
protected
though
debates
about
foreign
policy
is
not
or
that
one
can
only
praise
but
not
criticize
public
policy.
that
is
the
meaning
of
graded
mostly.
but
it
is
far
too
late
in
the
day
to
argue
that
all
speech
is
one
undifferentiated
whole
so
that
the
deceptive
(inaudible)
strength
of
a
commercial
salesperson
is
the
constitutional
equal
of
a
political
address.
in
summary
that
this
case
graces
a
host
of
complex
issues
not
the
least
of
depth
of
procedure.
and
these
complexities
can
be
most
easily
avoided
through
recognizing
this
as
the
moot
controversy
that
it
is.
but
my
concluding
remarks
return
to
the
merits
because
there,
princeton's
arguments
are
not
only
wrong
on
the
law
but
profoundly
dangerous
to
the
meaning
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
decision
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
does
not
open
up
the
princeton
campus
so
those
wishing
to
expound
on
the
merits
of
their
pizzas
or
used
cars.
but
to
chris
schmid
who
wishes
to
engage
his
fellow
citizens
in
this
course
relating
to
the
polity
of
which
we
are
all
apart.
it
has
become
the
duty
of
this
court
to
reject
princeton's
claim
of
exemption
from
new
jersey's
constitution
and
to
reassert
instead
the
right
of
a
state
to
assure
the
preservation
of
the
public
discussion
that
undergirds
a
republican
form
of
government.
indeed,
this
case
presents
an
example
of
our
uniquely
federal
system
at
its
best.
the
fact
that
the
united
states
constitution
is
interpreted
by
this
court
has
not
been
held
to
provide
by
its
own
force
access
to
non-state
controlled
property
saved
for
company
towns
does
not
preclude
a
state
from
structuring
its
laws
to
afford
additional
protection
for
important
public
values.
states
are
not
to
be
sure
of
--
free
to
act
without
limits
but
their
willingness
to
be
imaginative
and
creative
in
responding
to
the
exigencies
of
modern
life
should
not
be
stifled
unless
constitutionally
compelled.
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
new
jerseys
and
californians.
mr.
sanford
levinson
if
one
assumes
as
i
recall
that
the
constitution
does
give
congress
the
power
to
regulate
of
--
the
district
of
columbia,
i
would
be
prepare
to
argue,
yes,
if
georgetown
came
before
this
court
arguing,
no,
the
reason
would
be
free
exercise,
not
academic
freedom.
mr.
sanford
levinson
george
washington,
without
a
doubt.
mr.
sanford
levinson
that
congress
could
pass
a
law
of
--
in
behalf
of
defending
the
values
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
yes,
you
could
keep
those
who
wish
to
sell
pizzas
or
engage
in
commercial
speech
off
but
congress
could,
i
think,
require

at
least
and
perhaps
at
most
to
adapt
the
kinds
of
rules
adapted
by
princeton
university
subsequent
to
the
initiation
of
this
case
and
de
facto
upheld
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
its
decision
that
is
before
you.
mr.
sanford
levinson
i
am
stating
that
the
decision
on
appeal
before
this
court
certainly
does
not
extend
that
far
because
the
opinion
bends
over
backwards
to
what
the
educational
policy
of
the
institution
in
question.
let
us
say
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
what
i
am
submitting
is
that
the
college
raised
in
hypothetical
by
chief
justice
burger
could
put
forth
serious
free
exercise
claims
that
might
well
lead
this
court
to
say
that
public
power
have
gone
too
far.
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
say
that
in
our
brief
in
some
distinction
from
the
brief
of
amicus
american
association
of
university
professors,
we
emphasize
the
fact
that
on
princeton's
campus
are
required
to
leave
3000
registered
--
potentially
registered
voting
adults
and
if
a
state
found
in
the
hypothetical
post
of
that,
it
was
necessary
to
order
such
entrée
onto
campus
in
order
to
reach
registered
voters
or
potentially
registered
voters
--
the
brief
of
appellee
suggests
that
that
would
be
defensible.
the
brief
of
amicus
american
association
of
university
professors
is,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
somewhat
more
deferential
to
the
interest
of
an
educational
--
of
institutes
and
per
se.
mr.
sanford
levinson
a
marxist
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
the
facts
of
the
case
before
us
deal
with
someone
participating
in
the
american
political
process
trying
to
pass
out
information
for
candidates
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
--
beyond
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
--
someone
--
if
a
state
legislature
or
congress
in
your
initial
hypothetical
or
the
people
in
their
constitution
said
that
the
importance
of
the
free
trade
in
ideas
and
exposure
to
diversity
that
has
been
emphasized
as
the
root
meaning
of
academic
freedom
of
--
in
opinions
by
this
court
over
many
years
that
that
commitment
to
diversity
of
expressing
required
entrée
to
a
private
university.
yes
sir,
i
would
defend
the
ability
of
a
state
to
do
that.
mr.
sanford
levinson
i
am
saying
that
in
one,
there
is
a
free
exercise
claim
--
mr.
sanford
levinson
--
that
poses
serious
constitutional
problems.
mr.
sanford
levinson
if
a
university
--
to
return
to
a
hypothetical
raised
in
the
court
below,
if
a
university
on
whose
campus
was
forced
to
leave
--
were
forced
to
leave
3000
students
said,
“we
wish
only
republican
ideas,”
contemporary
republican
rather
than
classical
republican
ideas
to
be
heard
on
this
campus.
during
a
political
campaign,
i
would
not
support
the
right
of
a
university
to
in
effect
prevent
access
to
registered
voters
by
non-republicans.
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
the
university
must
teach
non-republican
values
in
its
classrooms
or
even
a
point
non-republicans
to
the
faculty
but
it
cannot
structure
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
mr.
sanford
levinson
there,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
over
the
set
has
emphasized
the
special
nature
of
military
communities
and
the
necessity
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
not
to
be
distracted
in
effect
by
political
controversies
of
the
day
which
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
that
which
one
would
say
about
the
kind
of
university
depicted
for
example
in
justice
powell's
opinion
in
the
bakke
case
wherein
every
other
opinion
by
this
court
that
has
addressed
the
meaning
of
academic
freedom.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
judgment
below
if
not
dismissed
should
certainly
be
affirmed.
