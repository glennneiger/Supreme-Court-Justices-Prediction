mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
rights
of
a
federal
--
of
a
private
university
under
the
federal
constitution,
the
first,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
determine
without
state
governmental
interference,
the
expressive
activities
of
strangers
that
it
permits
upon
its
property.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
--
it
does,
justice
rehnquist.
the
question
has
been
raised
withstanding
and
i'll
address
that
right
now
if
you
wish.
is
there
any
particular
part
of
it
that
you
would
wish
me
to
address
or
do
you
want
to
hear
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
my
argument
definitely?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
princeton
gets
in,
your
honor,
because
it
was
invited
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
to
intervene
in
the
case.
i
think
that
the
word
intervener
means
that
you're
there
as
a
party.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
so,
yes.
because
if
we
were
a
party
in
that
case
under
state
law
and
properly
so,
unless
there's
some
constitutional
reason,
a
due
process
reason
which
has
not
been
suggested
in
this
case,
as
to
why
we
should
not
be
there,
then
i
think
we
have
participated
in
a
decision
where
we
are
bound,
a
decision
in
which
we
participated,
in
which
we
have
an
interest
in
and
which
we
are
bound
by
the
result.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
i
believe,
if
we
had
--
if
we
had
been
invited
to
participate,
for
example,
as
amicus,
i
think
it
would've
been
open
to
us
following
the
opinion
there
and
assuming
that
it
was
not
appealed
to
this
court,
it
would've
been
open
to
princeton
to
have
sought
an
injunction
against
mr.
schmid
or
the
american
labor
party
from
coming
on
to
campus
at
princeton
and
that
would've
proceeded
through
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
then
on
up
on
here
on
appeal.
now,
that
--
if
that
were
the
law
in
this
court
then
obviously,
we
should
not
have
accepted
the
invitation
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
of
the
supreme
court
to
be
an
intervener
because
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
we've
lost
our
rights
of
appeal
as
a
result.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
it
is
real,
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
that
we
have
sacrificed
rights.
princeton
has
sacrificed
rights
in
this
case,
if
as
i
believe,
they
are
bound
by
that
decision
which
they
were
invited
to
intervene
in
which
they
fully
participated
and
i
see
it
to
be
no
different,
unless
there's
a
constitutional
reason
from
moving
as
we
did
for
rehearing
in
the
--
in
the
state
court.
the
state
did
not
happen
to
join
in
that
motion.
that
motion
was
denied
because
none
of
the
justices
wished
to
hear
it.
if
it
had
been
heard
and
the
decision
reversed,
then
that
would
be
the
same
position
that
it
will
be
and
that
this
court
would
remand
it
on
the
ground
that
the
new
jersey
constitution
violated
rights
of
the
property
owner
in
the
first
and
the
fifth
amendments.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
is
it
possible
that
was
a
mistake?
i
hope
not.
because
it
certainly
was
--
when
invited
to
intervene
at
new
jersey,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
a
very,
very
liberal
view
of
intervention
and
it
is
not
unusual
even
in
criminal
cases
to
have
intervention
although
it
is
unusual
for
private
parties
to
be
in
that.
it
is
--
normally
the
courts
will
invite
a
municipality
or
a
borough
or
somebody
else,
who
has
some
interest
in
a
criminal
prosecution
even
though
not
technically
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
the
criminal
prosecutor
to
intervene.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
don't
believe
--
it
is
clear
to
me,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
regulation
that
princeton
now
has
which
are
in
the
brief
are
not
consistent
with
the
interpretation
of
the
new
jersey
constitution
made
by
the
court
below
and
i
think
that's
very
obvious.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
because
he
never
even
asked
for
permission.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
they
presently
--
that
rule
still
tell
you
must
ask
for
permission.
so,
i
think
he
would
still
be
in
precisely
in
violation
of.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
not
to
the
decision,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
to
the
problem,
yes.
it
was
a
response
to
the
problem
and
they
decided,
for
whatever
reason
they
decided
to
at
least
try
a
new
regulation.
but
the
new
regulation
is,
as
i
say
tougher
in
some
respects,
more
liberal
on
others.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
it
still
requires
permission.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
at
least,
which
they
did
not
require
from
this
case.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
a
--
there's
a
difference
surely
between
changing
the
rule
of
a
private
organization.
if
you
change
work
rules,
for
example,
that
wouldn't
moot
the
questions.
under
the
old
rules
nor
would
you
narrowly
be
allowed
to
put
an
evidence
to
the
change
of
rules.
and
i
don't
see
--
i
think
these
rules
present
the
same
sentence,
the
same
problem
that
justice
rehnquist
that
the
other
rules
provided.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there
may
be
a
borough
ordinance,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
height
of
walls,
but
apart
from
that,
i
don't
know
of
anything
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
would
not
prevent
it,
nor
am
i
clear
at
the
--
under
the
new
jersey
constitution
that
if
they
said,
“if
you
want
to
keep
everybody
out,
that
you
can
do
so.”
the
test
that
they
apply
there
is
one
that
talks
about
the
more
you
invite
the
public,
the
more
you
allow
free
speech,
the
more
you
allow
controversy,
the
more
governmental
regulation
we
will
have.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
missed
the
word
there
justice.
required
to
what?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
would
suppose
that
--
if
you're
suggesting
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
state
could
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
it
is
a
private
property,
then
i
assume
it
is
state
property.
i
can't
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
i
don't
know
what's
in
between.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
doesn't
have
to.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
a
taking.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
i
suppose
today
at
least,
it
would
be
a
taking.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
is,
but
i
don't
–
it's
not
a
refusal
really
to
address
this
right
to
enforce
the
trespass
laws.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
is
--
it
is
saying
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
that
nobody
has
a
right
to
be
on
our
property.
we
could
--
we
could
not
even
take
self-help
at
this
point.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
we
object
to
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
we
object
to
it
on
both,
but
i
think
with
one
possible
exception.
if
like
--
if
we
could
not
prevail
on
the
free
speech
grounds,
it
would
have
very
unlikely
be
a
taking
and
the
one
exception
is
that
in
the
lloyd
and
tanner
it
said,
“if
there's
no
need
to
go
on
the
property
then
it
would
constitute
a
taking.
and
so
to
that
narrow
extent
since
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
no
need
for
communication
purposes
to
go
on
the
campus
of
princeton
that
--
that
might
be
a
taking.
but
i
basically,
fundamentally,
i
believe
that
it
is
a
first
amendment
right
mr.
justice
white
and
that
that
is
basically
what
we're
arguing
with
property
is
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
university
used
for
expressive
purposes.
then
to
--
for
the
--
for
the
state
to
impose
on
that
property,
expressive
purposes,
expressive
purposes
of
others
is
to
interfere
with
your
expressive
right.
i
grant
the
exceptions
that
can
be
made
to
that,
i
--
and
i
--
for
the
channels
of
communications
are
clogged
where
it
is
felt
necessary
for
--
for
state
power
to
do
so,
i
believe
it
--
it
can
be
done.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
--
with
pruneyard,
i
would
have
no
quarrel
with
--
with
the
--
the
prior
--
with
marsh.
i
would
have
no
quarrel
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
even
the
--
where
they
have
been
overruled.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
have
put
pruneyard
and
marsh
together
justice
marshall
for
only
--
for
only
one
purpose
to
serve.
i
put
them
together
because
in
each
instance,
they
said
we
are
--
we
will
treat
this
as
though
it
is
public
property
and
the
property
owner
will
have
the
obligations
of
government
with
respect
to
that
property
to
act
neutrally
and
to
have
only
time,
place,
and
manner.
it
was
for
that
purpose
that
i
was
putting
it
together.
here,
the
new
jersey
court
has
a
--
a
totally
different
rule.
it
has
a
rule
where
it
measures
content
against
content
to
decide
whether
it
can
be
said.
it
does
not
say,
you
must
admit
people
on
your
property,
to
say
anything
they
want.
they
say,
“you
must
admit
people
on
your
property
to
say
things
that
are
consistent
with
your
use
of
the
property,”
and
that
means
consistent
with
your
intellectual
use
of
the
property.
and
they
say
that
deciding
what
is
offensive
to
your
views
or
is
not
offensive
to
your
views
is
a
problem
for
the
judiciary.
it
is
a
problem
for
the
police
officers
to
resolve,
and
it
is
not
something
which
normally
would
be
under
the
trespass
statute
for
you
to
resolve
for
yourself.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
whether
what
mr.
schmid
did
or
not,
the
--
the
rule
that
they
put.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
think.
yes,
i
do.
let
me
--
let
me
--
you
have
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
so
can
anybody
else.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
so
can
anybody
else
at
princeton
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
would
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
princeton
is
restricted
as
the
new
jersey
court
says
it
is,
to
governmental
standards
of
time,
place
and
manner,
and
it
got
that
way
because
princeton
has
such
an
open
policy
and
let
people
up
on
the
campus,
then
i
assume
that
that
is
the
only
control.
now,
i
think
there
are
situations
as
open
as
princeton,
and
this
is
dedicated
to
those
purposes.
there
are
situations
on
a
college
campus
were
unquestioned.
what
is
said
is
highly
offensive
to
the
students
and
to
the
members
of
the
faculty
and
the
other
members
of
the
community.
i
believe
that
for
members
of
the
american
nazi
party,
to
proselytize
on
the
campus
of
princeton
would
be
highly
offensive
to
the
great
majority
of
students
there.
if
somebody
on
the
campus,
a
student
or
member
of
the
faculty,
wanted
to
adopt
those
views
and
express
or
even
if
they
wish
to
invite
somebody
who
did
that,
i
believe
that
that
decision
on
their
part
would
be
respected
by
other
members
of
the
community.
i
think
that
is
a
very
definite
thing
from
the
state
of
new
jersey
saying
to
princeton
whether
you
want
to
hear
him
or
not,
he's
got
a
right
to
be
there.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
justice,
the
dartmouth
college.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
did,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
i
understand
you
correctly
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
suggesting
that
it
is
in
effect
no
different
from
a
state
university.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
i
--
i
don't
accept
that
because
i
think
that
it
is
different
from
a
state
university.
it
is
not
totally
regulated
by
the
state.
it
has
a
charter
that
goes
back
as
the
dartmouth
case
did
and
in
that
case,
i
recollect,
this
court
said
that
they
had
all
the
rights
of
a
private
institution
they
were
not
just
a
creature
of
government.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
--
i
would
think
not.
there
are
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
but
i
think
we're
--
yes,
and
i
don't
see,
they
--
they
would,
but
if
the
general
public
were
invited
under
the
gm
premises
at
various
times
under
the
new
jersey
decision
then
people
would
have
rights
to
make
various
speeches
there
if
those
rights
did
interfere
with
the
assembly
line
and
so
forth,
and
so
on.
it
is
a
--
it
is
an
enormously
broad
principle
that
they
have
adapted
by
saying,
every
private
property
owner
in
the
state
is
subject
to
some
measure.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
by
time,
place
and
manner
only
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
what
they
say
for
princeton,
at
least.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
--
but
the
standard
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
plus
invitation.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
they
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
would
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
have
to
do
something
more
than
that.
why
they
have
to
do
something
more
than
that.
and
what
right
of
who
is
violated
by
you're
not
doing
something
more
than
that?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
--
i
believe
it
would
for
two
reasons.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
for
two
reasons.
i
think
one
is,
it
would
--
in
a
--
if
--
if
your
business
is
expressive
activity,
then
that
regulation
itself
forces
you
to
state
what
expressive
activities
you
will
or
will
not
permit
and
what
your
reasons
for
it
are
and
that
seems
to
me
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
to
--
yes,
to
require
that.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
it
goes
that
far.
i
think
it
almost
says
that
the
more
letters
to
the
editor
you
print,
the
more
you
have
to
print.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
let
me
suggest
justice
o'connor.
i
--
i
have
no
problem
with
pruneyard.
i
think
pruneyard
first
involved
the
shopping
center,
had
no
expressive
activity
and
i
think
that
was
quite
clear
that
the
premises
had
never
been
used
for
expressive
activity
even
though
there
were
some
concern
by
at
least
some
members
of
the
court
in
that
regard
when
it
came
to
the
expressive
activity.
secondly,
the
basis
for
that
decision
in
justice
newman's
court
in
his
state
court
decision
was
that
shopping
centers
had
replaced
downtown
centers
into
a
dangerous
degree
and
that
the
problems
of
communicating
on
political
matters
with
large
numbers
of
people
were
seriously
impaired
by
the
exclusion
of
those
activities
on
shopping
centers.
so,
there
was
i
think
a
compelling
state
reason
for
requiring
the
owners
to
permit
these
activities
on
those
premises.
and
the
third
reason
that
i
would
urge
which
was
--
is
related
to
it
is
that
the
california
court
having
made
that
decision
set
a
rule
which
it
set
all
shopping
centers
which
may
be
somewhat
vague,
but
all
shopping
centers
have
to
do
this.
and
there
is
no
test
which
analyzes
the
content
of
what
the
visitor
on
the
premises
wants
to
say
as
against
the
content
of
what
the
person
whose
expressive
activities
are
involved
wants
to
say
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
would
not
justice
o'connor
unless
there
was
a
compelling
state
reason
for
it
and
i
can't
see
it.
if
they
--
if
the
reason
--
it
would
be
a
much
stronger
case
here
if
the
facts
said
the
--
there
is
no
way
of
getting
at
the
students
of
princeton,
they
are
--
can't
be
informed
about
political
activity,
people
are
kept
off
the
campus,
there's
no
way
of
doing
it.
whether
that
case
would
survive
the
constitutional
test
or
not,
it
would
be
an
awful
lot
better
than
this
case.
this
case,
the
court
says,
“there's
absolutely
no
need
for
that.”
no
need
at
all
for
that
but
they
can
go
on
anyhow.
i
don't
see
--
i
have
difficult
seeing
any
state
reason
it
of.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
for
accreditation
on
the
(inaudible)
of
giving,
they
are,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
that's
about
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
as
a
practical
matter,
justice
white,
that
is
true.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
is
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
they
can't
stop
you
from
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
as
a
--
well,
no.
my
point
is
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
i
don't
think
they
can
stop
you
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
from
teaching
it.
they
can
stop
you
from
giving
a
degree
for
it.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
minimal
standard.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
and
that
is
basically
for
fraud
reasons
because
of
the
--
and
i
do
not
have
any
problems
with
expressive
activity
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
i
would
have
problems
with
that.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
have
certain
minimal
standards.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
and
they
do
and
i
think
they
do
it
so
that
those
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
oh,
i
think
tremendously
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
oh,
we're
not
saying,
they're
not
saying.
somebody
else
can
come
on
this
campus.
somebody
else
can
come
on
your
property.
somebody
else
can
do
that.
we're
going
to
give
him
a
right
to
do
that.
all
they're
saying
is,
“unless
you
must
make
some
minimal
standards
of
education
in
your
own
way,
that's
really
all
the
accreditation
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
it
was
down
to.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
of
course
not,
i
mean,
of
course
not.
i
would
agree
that
--
i
have
no
problem
with
that
kind
of
intrusion.
i
don't
think
that,
justice
rehnquist,
they
could
say
a
police
officer
can
come
on
the
campus
of
princeton
for
the
purposes
of
making
speeches.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
or
offering
a
course
or
doing
something
of
that
kind.
in
the
course
of
his
duties,
of
course
--
of
course
you
can
have
inspection
of
heating
systems
and
sewer
systems
and
other
legitimate
things
you
inflict
on
all
property
owners.
princeton
stands
in
no
special
status.
there
are
no
private
university
does
it
in
my
judgment.
so
i
have
no
problem.
can
princeton
discriminate
and
say
that
the
white
speakers
can
come
on
the
campus
but
not
black
speakers?
i
don't
think
so.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
free
speech.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
believe
so
justice
o'connor.
i
think
in
the
past
at
least
the
precedent
has
been
as
to
standing
in
the
court
below,
you
were
a
party
to
the
court
below
and
you
have
an
interest
and
you
have
standing
in
this
court,
if
that
is
not
the
rule.
if
the
rule
for
standing
is
a
federal
rule,
then
with
respect
i
suggest
you
have
to
make
the
standards
of
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
federal
rules
as
well.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
right.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
right.
that
was
why
i
--
i
said
if
you
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
you
don't
give
standing,
then
you
got
to
do
something
about
not
being
bound
by
a
judgment
or
it
seems
to
me
where
you
have
been
left
and
in
a
virtually
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
it
does
not
mean.
you're
correct
about
that
justice
white,
you're
correct
with
that.
but
if
the
--
as
a
federal
question,
if
it
adapts
the
state
standards
which
is
what
i
--
would
be,
i
think
a
more
accurate
way
of
saying
that
i
have
--
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
justice
o'connor,
it
would.
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
just
one
brief
comment
mr.
chief
justice.
i
hope
that
the
members
of
this
court
do
not
think
that
it
was
a
claim
of
princeton
university
that
it
can
discriminate
on
race
as
of
educational
philosophy
or
that
it
can
keep
people
off
the
campus
because
of
educational
philosophy.
or
that
a
court
cannot
inquire
and
enforce
for
the
republic
policy
statute
into
that
issue
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
genuine
question
of
educational
policy
in
philosophy.
