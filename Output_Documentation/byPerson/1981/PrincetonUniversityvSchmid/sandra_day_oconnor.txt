justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
katzenbach,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
two
different
areas.
one
is
i'm
not
clear
on
how
princeton
distinguishes
the
pruneyard
case
and
distinguishes
itself
from
pruneyard
and
explain
to
me
what
difference
it
makes
that
princeton
shops
or
selling
physics
and
poetry
instead
of
dry
goods.
why
isn't
pruneyard
applicable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
new
jersey
were
to
say
that
no
college
or
university
campus
may
exclude
anyone,
you
would
be
satisfied.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
katzenbach,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
standing
issue
again
--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--
if
i
may.
isn't
the
question
of
whether
princeton
has
standing
to
appeal
a
federal
question
to
this
court
itself
a
federal
question?
does
it
really
matter
to
us
whether
new
jersey
let
princeton
come
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
have
to
determine
that
question
anew
from
a
federal
standpoint?
