justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
enforce
or
even
try
to
enforce
your
rule
again
without
--
which
you
might
had
been
able
to
do
if
you
hadn't
been
a
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
also
creates
--
is
sufficient
to
create
a
case
of
controversy
between
you
and
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
still
require
a
permission.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
which
the
court
below
had
said
was
--
was
improper.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
feel
you're
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
katzenbach
i
thought
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the
major
part
of
your
argument
was
that
new
jersey's
refusal
to
apply
its
trespass
laws
may
not
violate
your
property
rights
but
your
free
speech
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
--
is
the
judgment
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
--
you
objected
on
grounds
as
i
understand
it
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
is
--
is
on
free
speech
ground.
it's
not
just
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
property
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
say,
“you
cannot
require
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he'd
have
permission?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
saying
to
the
newspaperman
that
you
should
--
he
should
be
required
to
put
certain
kinds
of
things
on
your
paper.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
--
in
that
sense
they
tell
you
what
kind
of
expression
you
can
have
at
least
indirectly,
they
don't
order
you
this
course
or
that
course
but
you
either
live
up
to
the
standards
or
you're
out
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
legal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
legal
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
legal
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
isn't
this
a
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
this
--
isn't
this
--
doesn't
the
state
insist
that
you
live
up
to
a
certain
standard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
your
expressive
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
fraud
reasons?
i
don't
know.
i
think
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
if
you
want
to
purport
to
be
an
educational
institution,
you
have
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
--
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
really
much
different
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
they're
just
telling
you
what
you
have
to
--
can
or
can't
teach.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
offering
a
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
argument
you
gave
awhile
ago
though
mr.
katzenbach
would
have
--
would
have
purported
to
suffice
to
--
that
even
if
it's
a
federal
question,
i
think
you
probably
will
find
that
it
is
a
federal
question
but
--
but
you
say
that
if
it's
a
standing
question
and
just
an
article
iii
question,
in
case
of
controversy,
and
you
say
that
you've
lost
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you're
bound
by
a
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
mean
though
that
it's
not
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levinson,
do
you
think
that
the
--
the
result
of
this
judgment
is
that
--
is
that
--
and
the
main
thrust
of
it
is
that
princeton
is
no
longer
permitted
to
keep
this
person
off
the
campus?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
use
self-help
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well,
so
that
--
so
that
the
case
involves
more
than
the
constitutional
right
to
have
new
jersey
enforce
its
trespass
statute.
it
involves
whether
or
not
princeton
may
by
itself
help
keep
this
person
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
barred
from
having
such
a
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
know
what,
in
some
cases
from
--
some
cases
from
state
courts
when
there
has
been
a
change
of
law
after
a
judgment
of
the
state
court,
we
have,
not
always
but
sometimes,
vacated
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
new
rule
or
the
new
statutory
provision.
why
wouldn't
that
be
appropriate?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
then
--
we
then
would
--
we
then
--
they
could
then
decide
whether
or
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
right.
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
they
--
and
so
--
but
--
well
then
a
fortiori,
wouldn't
they
then
require
a
--
or
--
or
outlaw
any
requirement
that
they
ask
for
permission?
they
didn't
--
they
certainly
did.
that
--
that
rule
would
--
that
prohibition
would
seem
to
survive
the
change
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levinson,
could
congress
do
the
same
thing
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
respect
to
georgetown
and
george
washington
or
catholic
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
george
washington?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
doubt,
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
saying
that
george
washington
you
must
allow
in
your
campus
certain
kinds
of
speech
but
you
can
keep
others'
speech
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
submitting?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
--
and
i
think
if
you
would
say
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
--
you
would
say
there'd
be
a
difference
between
a
catholic
university
and
american
university,
you
would
say
you
would
--
you
would
value
the
religious
freedom
claim
higher
than
the
free
speech
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
american
university
comes
in
and
says,
“i
am
not
making
a
free
exercise
claim,
i'm
making
a
free
speech
claim.
i
don't
want
to
be
told
what
kind
of
speech
to
be
--
to
be
airing
on
--
on
the
campus.”
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
army
base?
it
has
10,000
soldiers
living
on
it.
