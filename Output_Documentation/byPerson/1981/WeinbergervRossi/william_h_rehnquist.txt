justice
william
h.
rehnquist
section
106
of
public
law
number
92-129
enacted
in
1971
prohibits
employment
discrimination
against
united
states
citizens
on
military
basis
overseas
unless
permitted
by
“treaty”.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
word
treaty
is
used
in
the
1971
act
includes
executive
agreements
concluded
by
the
president
with
the
host
country
or
whether
instead
it
is
limited
to
those
international
agreements
entered
into
by
the
president
when
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
pursuant
to
article
ii
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
statutory
language
in
question
included
only
article
ii
treaties.
our
examination
of
the
legislative
history,
the
meaning
of
the
language
congress
used
and
other
applicable
canons
of
construction
leads
us
to
a
different
conclusion.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
word
treaty
in
section
106
embraces
executive
agreements
such
as
we're
involved
in
this
case
as
well
as
article
ii
treaties.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
