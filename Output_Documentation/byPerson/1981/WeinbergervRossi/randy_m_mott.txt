mr.
randy
m.
mott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
the
court
today
is
unique
in
one
important
respect.
the
four
lead
plaintiffs
in
this
action
in
the
district
court
actually
had
jobs
at
the
u.s.
naval
station
subic
bay.
they
were
all
americans.
one
was
a
retired
navy
enlisted
person,
one
was
a
resident
american
in
the
philippines,
and
two
were
american
dependents.
they
all
received
notices
that
they
were
losing
their
job,
not
because
of
their
performance
on
the
job
but
because
their
job
had
been
changed
because
they
were
u.s.
citizens,
and
the
job
was
now
going
to
be
labeled
a
local
national
job,
and
they
could
no
longer
keep
the
job.
they
perhaps
more
graphically--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--that's
right.
as
senator
schweiker
pointed
out
in
the
history
of
this
measure,
this
is
perhaps
unique
in
the
annals
of
certainly
the
western
world
that
a
country
would
discriminate
against
its
own
citizens.
i
think
that--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--the
distinction
being?
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no.
and,
of
course,
our
position
would
recognize
that.
in
fact,
in
any
case
such
as
that
the
executive
would
be
free
to
submit
to
the
senate
a
version
for
agreement.
in
the
event
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
the
executive
could
simply
take
the
agreements
it
deems
essential
and
submit
them
to
the
senate
for
approval.
there's
no
prospective--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--excuse
me?
mr.
randy
m.
mott
as
it
is
now,
that's
right.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
that's
right.
and,
of
course,
we
are
not...
and
i
would
add
to
this,
in
the
event
the
practice
was
determined
unlawful,
there's
no
district
court
order
on
relief
here.
i
would
imagine
just
as
under
title
vii
in
race
and
sex
cases
there
wouldn't
be
wholesale
bumping
out
of
the
incumbent
employees.
there
would
be
some
equitable
arrangement
worked
out.
so
i...
our
position
is
the...
prospectively
there
are
a
lot
options
open
to
the
executive,
and
clearly
nothing
that--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--no.
i
believe
that's
inaccurate.
we
have
determined
from
the
materials
cited
in
the
brief
for
the
government,
a
dod
circular
summarize
manpower
strengths,
that
is,
as
of
the
end
of
june
there
were
114,000
local
nationals
employed
by
the
department
of
defense
overseas.
counting
the
countries--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--no.
counting
germany
where
there
was
a
question
of
whether
the
status
of
forces
agreement
applied
and
required
this,
about
70,000
of
those
jobs
would...
local
national
jobs
would
be
in
countries
where
there
would
be
agreements
construed
to
require
preference.
now,
of
course,
not
all
those
jobs...
there
would
not
be
dependents
of
americans
available
for
all
those
jobs.
in
the
philippines,
prior
to
the
base
labor
agreement
of
1968
and
prior
to
a
preference
reserved
by
agreement,
there
was
in
fact
a
very
large
number,
the
preponderant
number
of
those
employees
were
local
national
anyway.
we're
talking
really
about
a
fine
tuning
off
that
number,
but
it
is
a
large
base
number
to
begin--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--that's
right.
that's
right.
and
as
you
may
well
realize,
of
course,
the
number
of
dependents
that
are
overseas,
while
it
is
large,
usually
includes
small
children
and
other
people
who
would
not
be
interested
in
the
work.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no.
the
agreement--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
every--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--every
u.s.
facility
maintained
by
the
department
of
defense
in
the
philippines.
there
are
separate
arrangements,
i
understand,
for
the
department
of
state
on
local
national
hiring
that
aren't
at
issue
here.
the--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
we
know
as
follows.
we
know
that
the
department
of
defense
told
senator
schweiker
in
the
hearings
on
the
1971
measure
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
encourage
the
hiring
of
u.s.
citizens,
not
local
nationals;
that
there
had
been
some
trouble
with
it
in
the
past
but
that
they
were
embarking
on
a
new
frontier,
and
they
actually
anticipated
giving
dependents
a
preference
over
others.
that
was
in
1971,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
measure
that
became
the
schweiker
amendment.
we
know
that
senator
schweiker
in
the
floor
debates
said
that
what
had
happened
in
europe,
the
one
example
in
the
legislative
history
cited
by
the
government
had
been
corrected.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
felt
that
that
one
incident
had
already
been
rendered
moot
and
had
by
the
executive's
own
position
at
the
time
been
inconsistent
with
the
position
of
the
department
of
defense.
so
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
as
of
1971
or
any
time
since
that
commanders
are
given
the
discretion
to
do
this.
the
dod
instructions,
which
we
have
included
in
the...
a
couple
of
passages
from
in
the...
in
our
brief,
the
dod
instruction
from
1974,
for
example,
says
that
dependents
are
to
get
a
preference
only
to
the
extent
of
treaties
and
agreements
requiring
local
national
preferences.
so
that's
there
no
option,
at
least
on
paper,
in
the
department
of
defense
for
local
commanders
to
do
this
and
apparently
never
has
been.
the
key,
though,
is
even
internally
in
the
department
of
defense
there's
a
distinction
between
treaty
and
other
agreements,
and
in
particular,
the
1961
policy
that
was
in
effect
and
was
the
circular
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
legislation,
provided...
and
i
think
this
is
extremely
important
to
keep
in
mind...
the
policy
at
the
time
provided
the
military
departments
will,
consistent
with
status
of
forces
agreements,
country
to
country
agreements
and
treaties,
make
the
maximum
feasible
reduction
in
the
number
of
local
national
employees
for
nonappropriated
fund
activities.
that
was
in
1961
and
was
the
policy
then
in
effect
for
the
department
of
defense.
so
there
was
no
policy
of
local
commanders
being
allowed
to
create
side
arrangements
whereby
there
were
local
national
preferences.
everything
that
was
done
was
done,
if
it
was
done
consistent
with
dod
policy,
was
done
either
by
status
of
forces
agreements,
country
to
country
agreements
and
treaties.
and
what
congress
did
in
referring
to
the
march
1962
memo,
it
said
we're
only
going
to
allow
one
of
those
exceptions,
treaties.
if
you
continue
to
need
to
discriminate
against
our
own
people
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
a
base,
come
back
to
us
and
do
it
in
the
form
of
a
treaty,
and
the
senate
will
authorize
it.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
i'm
making
one
jump
there.
the
memo
is
included
in
the
legislative
history.
it
is
referred
to--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
there
is
additionally
more.
maybe
i
should
get
immediately
into
that.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
and...
and
related--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--that's
correct.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
that's
correct.
and,
of
course,
the
local
national
preferences
had
been
most
strongly
done
in
practice,
and
there's
a
larger
number
of
them
apparently
in
the
nonappropriated
fund
activities
area
because
it's
recreational.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
right.
and
if
it
was
a
civilian
employee
in
the
headquarters
of
nato
or
something
in
brussels,
there
would
be...
there
are...
many
of
those
positions
are
regular
u.s.
civil
service
positions,
and
people
are--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
an
important
one
that
is
included
in
the
philippines,
however,
the
other
way
is
nurses.
there
is
a
local...
the
local
national
preference
is
given
to
nurses;
so
if
a
dependent
comes
in
who's
a
nurse,
and
several
of
the
42
individual
plaintiffs
are,
they
couldn't
get
a
job.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no.
i
don't--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
and
it's
been--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
it
will
have
to
go
back
to
negotiations.
that's
the...
the
posture--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--i
don't
think
necessarily.
all
we
have
is
rhetoric
to
look
at
that.
there's
no
facts
in
the
record.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
do.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
i
was
going
to
go
back
to--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
in
1976
the
philippine
union
called
for
an
abrogation
of
the
base
labor
agreement,
and
so
depending
on
which
the
winds
blow--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--it
was--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
the
public
statements
were
made
to
that
effect.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
the
agreement
was
renewed.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
and
a
significant--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
we
do
know
that
when
that
agreement
was
being
negotiated,
the
executive
branch
told
the
senate
that
the
agreement
would
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
approval,
and
that
the
agreement
would
in
fact
cover
the
local
national
preference.
the
real
policy
issue
here
is
not
whether
we
can
keep
our
base
or
even
whether
we
can
continue
preferential
hiring
if
we
need
to
to
keep
the
philippines
happy.
the
issue
is
how
do
we
do
that.
the
real
objection
of
the
executive
in
the
government's
brief
in
its
footnote
21
is
that
if
you
had
to
submit
these
things
as
article
ii
treaties,
it
would
be
time
consuming
and
reduce
negotiating
flexibility.
that's
the
issue.
any
arrangement...
and
senator
percy
in
the
military
appropriation
debates
in
december
pointed
out
for
this
current
fiscal
year
he
need
to
continue
to
have
some
of
these
agreements.
he's
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee.
i'm
sure
they
could
get
expedited
approval
of
any
agreement
if
justice
marshall's
scenario
were
the
facts.
however,
let
me
point
out
one
thing.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
i
understand
as
one...
the
most
recent
base
agreement
we
provided
several
hundred
million
dollars
of
economic
aid
as
part
of
the
package
to
satisfy
the
republic
of
philippines.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no,
not...
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no.
the
lead
claimant,
mr.
rossi,
did
not.
many
of
these
people
don't.
but
this
exactly
the
point
that
congress
has
addressed,
and
i
think
this
is
a
policy
prerogative
for
the
congress
to
address,
not
this
court.
congress
has
consistently
supervised
for
years
the
manpower
requirements
of
the
department
of
defense
at
overseas
bases,
including
the
mix
between
local
nationals
and
u.s.
citizens.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
language
has
been...
has
required
clear
inconsistency
and
some
other
phrases
such
as
even
going
back
to
cherokee
tobacco.
the
point
congress...
and
why
congress
excluded...
included
the
treaty
proviso
in
this,
you
have
to
look
at
what
was
happening
in
the
82nd
congress.
they
were
lamenting
that
the
executive
was
doing
too
much
by
executive
agreement
and
not
enough
by
treaty,
and
by
saying
that,
they
were
contemplating
there
might
have
to
be
exceptions
to
the
rule,
and
they
were
making
explicit
what
might
have
been
otherwise
implicit,
but
they
were
saying
if
you
need
to
do
it
and
need
to
have
local
national
preferences,
come
back
to
the
senate
for
approval.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
language
is
superfluous.
in
fact,
the...
if
anything,
it
reflects
some
wisdom
because
the
executive
has
never
come
back
with
anything
despite
these
invitations
to
do
so.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
language,
however,
in
the
82nd
congress
which
passed
the
case--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--ninety-second,
excuse
me.
they
encouraged
the...
by
the
case
act
the
filing
of
executive
agreements
with
congress.
they
encouraged
the
two
base
agreements
to
be
submitted
as
treaties
in
lieu
of
executive
agreements.
there
were
a
lot
of
pronouncements
about
whether
the
executive
should
act
by
treaty
or
executive
agreement,
particularly
at
that
time
in
the
early
'70s,
and
i
think
this
is
just
a
continuation
of
that.
the
key
phrase,
though...
and
i
do
take
considerable
difference
with
the
government's
characterization
of
the
record
as
containing
no
reference
to
agreements...
the
key
phrase
by
senator
hughes,
relied
on
by
judge
wilkie
in
the
court
of
appeals,
never
has
really
been
explained
by
the
government,
and
i
think
it's
critical.
senator
hughes
noted
that
dependents
of
enlisted
personnel
are
denied
the
opportunity
to
work
on
overseas
bases
by
agreement
with
the
countries
in
which
they
are
located
and
are
forced
to
live
in
poverty.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
independent
commander
nexus
with
discrimination
at
that
time.
the
department
of
defense
had
said
its
policy
was
to
the
contrary,
and
the
only
example
was
exhorted
as
a
mutation
from
the
main
policy
of
not
doing
it
internally.
the
commanders
didn't
have
the
discretion
to
do
it.
so
senator
hughes'
statement
is
exactly
accurate.
the
reason
why
the
people
couldn't
get
the
jobs
was
the
agreements.
now,
the
government
tries
to
say
senator
hughes,
who
was
a
sponsor
of
the
legislation
and
helped
presumably
work
on
its
language,
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about
and
might
be
referring
to
some
other
kinds
of
agreements.
but
the
agreements
which
perpetuated
discrimination
were
in
effect
then,
were
executive
agreements,
and
senator
hughes
says
the
people
can't
get
jobs
because
of
agreements.
now,
unless
you're
assuming
that
senator
hughes
made
a
mistake,
there
isn't
any
other
way
to
read
that.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
however,
the
key
to
the--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
right,
right.
and
the
key
is
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
was...
the
point
is
these
were
not
commander
agreements
with
the
foreign
government.
the
phipps
memo,
which
was
included
in
the
congressional
record,
was
an
internal
memo
of
the
european
exchange
system,
not
any
arrangement
the
base
commander
had
made
directly
with
the
host
government.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
of
the
consequences,
no.
there
are
two
references,
though,
that
were
not
mentioned
by
the
government
that
i
think
they're
important,
then
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
the
consequences.
the
two--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
the
first
was
in
the
senate
report
that
originated
the
provision,
and
it
said
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
is
to
correct
the
situation
of
discrimination
in
favor
of
local
nationals
and
against
american
dependents...
to
correct
the
situation,
not
to
take
care
of
a
hypothetical
where
another
commander
might
do
something,
but
to
correct
an
existing
situation.
that
language
was
repeated...
to
correct
a
situation...
in
the
conference
committee
report.
the
situation,
everyone
concedes,
was
continued
by
these
executive
agreements,
and
the
intent
was
to
get
out
of
it.
now--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--yes,
there
was.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
had
happened
is
apparently
there
was
a
new...
the
assistant
secretary
of
defense,
mr.
kelly,
indicated
that
in
fact
there
was
no
constraint
on
employing
u.s.
citizens,
and
that
the
policy
of
the
department
of
defense
was
to
employ
them
wherever
they
could.
that
was
in
the
supplemental
hearings
on
the
senate
side
at
page
76
and
77.
so
the
government
was
constantly
saying
it's
not
us
doing
it
internally;
it
is
not
the
department
of
defense's
policy.
and
they
did
not
discuss
in
there
the
agreements.
but
in
the
floor
debates
we
see
senator
hughes
referring
to
the
agreements.
i
think
the
chief
point
to
realize,
and
i
think
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
is
the
fact
that
if
the
treaty
exception
is
blown
out
to
include
any
kind
of
international
agreement,
then
the
section
just
folds
up
and
self-destructs.
it
does
absolutely
nothing.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
that
would
be--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--if
that
were
to
happen
hypothetically.
of
course,
the
legislative
history--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
but
the
legislative
history
says
the
purpose
was
to
correct
the
situation,
not
to
prevent
future
occurrences,
so--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--yes.
there
are
several,
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
extremely
salient
point,
because
really
the
government
creates
i
think
an
artificial
burden
of
persuasion
here
to
say
that
the
intent
has
to
be
specific,
there
has
to
be
specific
evidence
of
intent
to
abrogate.
that
has
never
been
done
by
this
court
before.
that
would
be
new
law.
in
cherokee
tobacco
there
was
an
internal
revenue
act
that
just
said
all
tobacco
in
the
united
states
is
taxed.
there
was
a
treaty
with
the
cherokees
that
said
tobacco
produced
in
the
cherokee
nation
would
not
be
taxed.
this
court
said
the
act
of
congress
must
prevail
as
if
the
treaty
were
not
an
element
to
be
considered.
there
was
no
evidence
that
congress
in
passing
this
general
revenue
measure
even
thought
that
the
cherokees
grew
tobacco.
there
was
no
reference
whatsoever.
in
sanchez
v.
the
united
states
in
1910
this
court
in
the
case
of
a
puerto
rican
who
claimed
he
had
a
government
quasi-public
position,
which
was
a
property
right
under
the
treaty
with
spain
and
puerto
rico,
this
court...
what
happened
is
the
military
governor
abolished
the
position,
and
then
congress
passed
the
foraker
act
preserving
the
law
of
puerto
rico
at
that
time
as
modified
by
military
decree.
so
the
position
was
abolished
by
the...
and
blessed
by
the
foraker
act.
and
this
court
held
that
the
act
of
congress
in
stating
the
military
order
superseded
the
treaty
with
spain,
and
this
court
commented
on
page
175
and
176,
"congress
did
not
intend
by
the...
even
if
congress
did
not
intend
by
the
foraker
act
to
modify
the
treaty,
if
that
act
were
deemed
inconsistent
with
the
treaty,
the
act
would
prevail.
"
the
point
is
not
that
the
intent
be
clearly
expressed
to
abrogate
but
only
that
there
be
clear
inconsistency.
and
that
is
a
similar
position
in
chae
chan
ping
v.
united
states
in
1898,
in
fdye
v.
robertson
in
1884,
in
united
states
v.
mcbratney
in
1881.
the
point
in
all
those
cases,
there
was
absolutely
no
intent
to
abrogate
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
act,
and
in
fact,
in
chae
chan
ping
this
court
said
it's
wholly
immaterial
whether
the
departure
from
the
treaty
was
accidental
or
designed.
if
it's
clearly
inconsistent,
the
statute
prevails.
i
think
the
point
here
is
largely
confused
by
the
government
bringing
in
the
repeals
by
implication
notion
which
applies
to
statutes,
and
we
cited
professor
henkin
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
he
more
adequately
describes
the
relationship.
and
that
is
that
congress
legislates
without
regard
to
international
obligations.
if
the
clear
effect
of
that
legislation
is
inconsistent,
then
for
domestic
law
purposes
the
agreement
has
to
be
superseded.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
the
situation
was,
as
senator
hughes
and
the
committee
report
described
it,
economic
hardship
by
military
families
overseas
since
dependents
could
not
get
jobs.
and
as
the
government
points
out,
this
was
a
critical
transition
in
1971
between
the
draft
and
the
all-volunteer
force,
and
they
were
attempting--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--that's
correct.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
12.
that
figure
came
from
the
trial
court
records.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
well,
there
are
two
things.
first...
well,
there
are
three.
if
i
can
first
say,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term
ii.
the
government
goes--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--where
it...
where--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
right.
no
indication
it
was
brought
to
anybody's
attention.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--for
jurisdiction
and
only
when
the
purpose
of
congress
would
be
frustrated
by
giving
it
the
normal
meaning.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
that's
right.
and
for
jurisdictional
purposes
the
court
of
claims
in
the
hughes
case
did
the
same
thing.
but
both
those
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense
to--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--the
second
one
is
the
references
by
senator
hughes
in
the
floor
debate
to
agreement
with
the
countries.
he
said
dependents
of
enlisted
personnel
are
denied
the
opportunity
to
work
on
overseas
bases
by
agreement
with
the
countries
in
which
they
are
located.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
there's
a
second
one
by
implication,
i
think,
and
that
is
senator
schweiker
pointed
out
that
most
civilian
jobs
in
u.s.
installations
in
europe
are
held
by
local
nationals
or
by
persons
from
another
european
country.
these
jobs
are
classified
as
local
national
jobs,
and
american
dependents
cannot
fill
the
jobs
because
of
their
classification.
now,
the
only
thing--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--right.
because,
for
example,
in
the
phipps
example
he
did
not
reclassify
the
jobs
as
local
national;
he
simply
said
he
wanted
all
european
exchange
system
elements
in
months
ahead
to
emphasize
recruitment
of
local
nationals
and
de-emphasize
recruitment
of
u.s.
dependents.
so
he
wasn't
classifying
jobs
saying...
and
literally
that's
what
happens
in
these
jobs.
if
you
apply
you
get
a
letter
back
saying
i'm
sorry,
you're
a
u.s.
citizen,
you
can't
apply.
it's
a
classification.
that
is
done
by
these
agreements.
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
the
policy
since
1961
had
been
that
dod
did
not
have
that
policy
of
classifying
and
restricting
jobs.
so
the
only
thing
that
classified
jobs
were
these
agreements.
the
only
discrimination
referred
to
in
the
congressional
record
or
anybody
knows
about
that
was
going
on
in
1971
against
u.s.
citizens
was
by
these
agreements.
the
policy
of
the
department
of
defense
was
to
encourage
people
to
the
extent
they
could
except
where
the
specified
types--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--that's
right.
and
i
really
hasten
to
emphasize
that
nowhere
has
this
court
ever
required
specific
intent
to
abrogate,
and
the
case
law
is
fairly
extensive
and
included
in
our
brief.
the--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--no.
i
think
to
the
contrary.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
senate
resolution
214
and
on
the
case
act.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
and
in
both
those
cases
they
used
it
very
specifically.
they
said,
in
the
case
act,
submit
international
agreements
other
than
treaties
to
congress.
now,
it's
interesting
that
all
these
agreements
entered
into
after
1971
had
been
submitted
under
the
case
act,
which
by
definition
only
applies
to
things
that
aren't
treaties.
if
the
government
was
really
right
that
the
same
82nd
congress
that
set
up
the
case
act
requirement
would
consider
these
things
to
be
treaties,
it
wouldn't
have
to
file
them
under
the
case
act
at
all.
and
the
point
is
this
elaborate
distinction
between
treaties
and
other
international
arrangements
only
exists
really
for
purposes
of
this
case.
the
government's
own
internal
memos,
the
state
department
procedures
on
when
you...
how
you
conclude
international
agreements,
the
very
memos
that
talk
about
the
policy
on
preferential
independent
hiring
always
make
the
distinction
between
treaties
and
other
agreements
and
always
use
treaties
in
the
constitutional
sense.
so
when
it
comes
time
to
defend
an
action
whereby
nothing
has
ever
been
submitted
as
a
treaty
and
the
exhortations
of
congress,
as
the
government
characterized
them,
have
been
ignored,
the
notion
of
a
non-article
ii
treaty
emerges
in
the
government's
brief.
and
that's
the
only
time
this
ever
has
come
up
as
an
administrative
construction.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
no,
it
did
not.
the
only
position
was
the
one
i
referred
to
in
which
they
said
their
policy--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
the
president
signed
it.
legislation
has
to
be
signed.
they
did
enact
it.
and
they
have
contemplated,
as
i
mentioned,
since
then
that
they
would
submit
these
kind
of
things
as
treaties.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
there
is
no
vehicle
for
congress
to
object
per
se,
but
congress
has
protested
in
a
couple
of
different
ways.
first,
the
gao,
the
legislative
agency
of
congress,
indicated
these
were
illegal
under
106
and
rendered
and
opinion
to
that
effect
in
1976.
second,
there
is
extensive
oversight
hearings
in
which
the
practice
is
criticized.
and
actually,
in
fy
1982
the
house
threatened
to
withdraw
all
funding
for
new
local
national
hiring,
and
the
provision
was
stricken
in
conference.
in
the--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--i
don't
know
of
a
way
congress
could.
mr.
randy
m.
mott
it
already
passed
a
law.
any
new
law
it
passed
would
have
the
effect
of
admitting
the
first
law
was
inadequate
and
that--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
that
would
imply
there
was
ambiguity
the
first
time
all
around,
and
all
the
victims
in
the
interim
period
would
have
another
legal
obstacle
to
recovery,
that
the
congress
felt
the
first
law
was
not
adequate.
there
is
a
reference
also
in
the
1977
house
report
95-68
at
page
25
to
the
fact
that
there
weren't
at
that
point
any
pending
lawsuits
to
challenge
this,
and
it
was
an
apparent...
i...
we
read
that
as
evidence
that
congress
was
waiting
for
a
case
like
this
to
come
along
to
challenge
the
construction
given
by
the
executive.
this
gets
really
to
the
separation
of--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--no
more
than
a
couple
affected
europe,
but
if
you
look
at
the
numbers,
there
are...
of
the...
i
don't
know
what
it
was
in
'71,
but
i
think
it
was
comparable;
we
haven't
changed
our
allocation
much
except
for
vietnam...
but
as
of
'81,
of
the
114,000
local
nationals
employed
overseas,
50,000
were
employed
in
germany,
so
germany
by
far
has
been
the
lion's
share
of
our
local
national
hiring,
and
that
was
done--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--well,
there
was
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
which
the
germans
interpreted
until
the
recent
german
labor
court
decision
as
requiring--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--there
is
some
controversy
of
whether--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--the
original
one.
there
are
supplements,
and
there's
a
question
of
whether--
mr.
randy
m.
mott
--whether
all
of
the
supplements
that
provided
the
language
the
german
unions
rely
on
were
actually
approved
by
the
senate.
thank
you.
