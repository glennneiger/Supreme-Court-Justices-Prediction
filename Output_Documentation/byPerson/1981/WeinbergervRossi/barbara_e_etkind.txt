ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
petition
of
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
statute
involved
is
section
106
of
public
law
92-129,
which
was
enacted
in
1971
and
which
forbids
discrimination
against
united
states
citizens
or
dependents
by
the
department
of
defense
in
its
employment
of
civilians
on
military
bases
overseas
unless
"prohibited
by
treaty".
the
single
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
word
ii,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
in
1944
congress
authorized
the
president
by
such
means
as
he
should
find
appropriate
to
withhold
or
to
acquire
and
to
retain
such
military
and
naval
bases
as
he
deemed
necessary
for
the
mutual
protection
of
the
united
states
and
the
philippines.
the
means
the
president
found
appropriate
were
two
international
agreements:
the
1947
military
bases
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
philippines,
and
the
supplemental
1968
base
labor
agreement,
which
is
at
issue
here.
neither
of
these
agreements
was
ever
submitted
to
the
senate
for
its
advice
and
consent.
in
the
military
bases
agreement
the
united
states
obtained,
among
other
things,
the
99-year
use
of
several
designated
military
bases
located
in
the
philippines,
as
well
as
the
right
upon
only
notice
to
the
philippines
to
the
use
of
additional
facilities
there
as
required
by
military
necessity.
the
major
military
facilities
currently
used
by
the
united
states
in
the
philippines
are
the
clark
air
base
and
the
naval
facility
at
subic
bay.
article
i
of
the
base
labor
agreement
provides
that
the
united
states
armed
forces
in
the
philippines
will
fill
its
needs
for
civilian
employment
on
these
bases
with
filipino
citizens
except
when
the
needed
skills
are
found
not
to
be
locally
available,
or
for
reasons
of
security
or
special
management
needs.
in
those--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--the
base
labor
agreement
has
not
been
amended,
no.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
in
those
cases,
united
states
nationals
may
be
employed.
when
section
106
was
passed
in
1971
there
were
in
existence
approximately
a
dozen
additional
such
agreements
in
which
the
united
states
provided
some
form
of
employment
preference
for
local
nationals
in
exchange
for
the
use
of
valuable
strategic
facilities
located
abroad.
in
march
1978
four
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
were
notified
that
their
jobs
as
game
room
managers
at
the
united
states
naval
facility
at
subic
bay
were
being
converted
into
local
national
positions
in
accordance
with
article
i
of
the
base
labor
agreement,
and
that
they
would
be
discharged
from
their
employment
with
the
navy.
the
four
respondents
subsequently
were
discharged,
and
after
exhausting
their
administrative
remedies,
they
filed
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
claiming
that
their
discharges
violated
section
106,
among
other
provisions.
approximately
30
additional
plaintiffs
joined
in
this
suit,
alleging
either
that
they
had
expressed
interest
in
civilian
employment
with
the
united
states
navy
in
the
philippines
but
had
failed
to
obtain
such
employment
because
of
the
local
national
employment
preference
contained
in
the
agreement,
or
that
they
had
been
rejected
for
a
specific
civilian
position
with
the
navy
in
the
philippines
because
the
positions
for
which
they
had
applied
were
reserved
for
local
nationals
under
article
i
of
the
base
labor
agreement.
the
district
court
denied
respondents'
claim
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
petitioners
on
the
ground
that
the
word
106
encompasses
all
binding
international
agreements,
including
the
base
labor
agreement.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
that
hasn't
been
challenged
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
there's
no
question
that
the
executive
does
have
the
right
to
enter
into
executive
agreements
other
than
treaties.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
executive
agreements
are
defined
in
the
restatement,
the
requirements
for
an
executive--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--the
restatement
of
foreign
relations
in
the
vienna
convention
on
laws.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
bind
this
court?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
but
it
has
been
looked
at
as
persuasive
authority.
there's
never
been--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--oh,
certainly,
yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
belmont
and
pink,
in
which
this
court
upheld
an
executive
agreement
by
which
the
courts...
by
which
the
executive
settled
outstanding
claims
of
national...
in
the
dames
and
moore
case
recently
an
executive
agreement
was
involved.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
an
agreement
for--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no,
no.
there
really
isn't
a
way.
as
we
point
out
in
our--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--this
one
follows...
almost
all
of
the
agreements
that...
base
labor
agreements
that
provide
for
national
employment
preferences
are
in
the
forms
of
congressional
executive
authority.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
they've
always
been
recognized
as
such.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
clearly.
and
that
is
why
i
referred
to
it
as
a
congressional
executive
agreement,
which
is
accorded
somewhat
more
status
than
an
executive
agreement
entered
into
solely
on
the
basis
of
presidential
authority.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i'm
sorry?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
for
something
that
had
to
be--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--this
is...
it
is
a
treaty
in
the
sense
of
an
international
agreement
which
is
between
countries
which
deals
with
broad
subject
matters
that
is
the
types
of
things
other
than
contracts
between
individual
parties
within
other
nations.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no
one
has
raised
it.
thank
you.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
exactly
the
question
in
the
case,
yes.
the
district--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--certainly,
yes.
and
in
holding
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no.
that's
exactly
the
question
here.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
what
did
congress
intend
by
the
use
of
the
word
106.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that
would
be
very
unusual,
because
that
way
the
senate
already
would
have
some
control.
in
holding
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--that's--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
no.
even
the
court
of
appeals
though
that
held
against
us
construed
the
word...
the
phrase
"unless
prohibited
by
treaty"
to
mean
unless
permitted
or
provided--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no.
well--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--it
is,
in
effect,
but
by
parsing
the
statutory
language
carefully
you
can
see
that
in
fact
what
it
is
is
a
double
negative.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
except
to
the
extent
that
you
said
that
it's...
it's...
what
is
prohibited
is
not
to
discriminate.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
in
this
case
certainly
it's
required
and
permitted
by
the
treaty.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
we
point
to
that
use
of
the
word
"prohibited"
as
an
example
of
how
congress
was
not
really
focusing
in
and
being
terribly
specific
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
in
ruling
for
us,
the
district
court
relied
primarily
on
the
concededly
sparse
legislative
history
which
the
court
found
argued
against
respondents'
contention
that
congress
intended
to
ban
all
discrimination
on
military
bases
abroad,
even
when
pursuant
to
an
agreement
between
nations.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
while
it
agreed
with
petitioners
that
the
mere
use
of
the
word
106
in
its
constitutional
sense,
and
that
it
accordingly
had
intended
sub
silentio
to
place
the
united
states
in
breach
of
all
existing
international
agreements
containing
local
national
employment
preferences.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
excuse
me.
at
the
time
section
106
was
enacted
there
were
about
12.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
there's
about
the
same
number
because
five
were
enacted
subsequently,
but
the
five
that
were
with
taiwan
have
been
abrogated.
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
the
mere
invocation
of
the
word
"treaty"
is
not
dispositive
of
whether
the
term
is
being
used
in
its
narrow
constitutional
sense
or
whether
it
is
intended
to
encompass
all
binding
international
agreements
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
the
only
example
that
is
pointed
to
in
the
sparse
legislative
history
is
that
of
a
commanding
officer.
that
was
only
by...
it
was
by
one
commanding
officer,
general
phipps,
who
was
the
commanding
general
of
the
entire
european
exchange
system.
he
had
within
his...
he
was
trying
to
change
4,000
jobs
that
americans
had
been
holding
to
local
national
positions.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
as
far
as
i
know,
no
article
ii
treaty
has
covered
an
agreement
giving
local
hiring
preferences.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
international
agreements
other
than
article
ii
treaties.
accordingly,
the
word
106
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
purposes
congress
sought
to
serve
by
the
enactment
of
that
provision.
in
our
view,
given
the
sparse
and
largely
superficial
legislative
history
of
section
106,
it
is
conceivable
that
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
that
statute
could
have
been
the
drastic
one
of
placing
the
united
states
in
breach
of
all
non-article
ii
agreements
that
contained
local
national
employment
preferences.
section
106
was
only
a
very
small
part
of
what
became
public
law
no.
92-129,
an
act
to
amend
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
to
increase
military
pay
and
for
other
purposes.
very
little
legislative
debate
was
devoted
to
the
provision,
and
only
a
few
senators
addressed
themselves
to
what
became
section
106.
indeed,
the
only
consequence
of
the
measure
that
was
considered
was
a
salutary
one
of
improving
the
financial
circumstances
and
therefore
the
morale
of
american
service
members
overseas.
but
as
i
alluded
to
earlier,
at
the
time
section
106
was
enacted,
there
were
in
existence
12
non-article
ii
agreements
to
which
the
united
states
was
a
party
and
which
provided
some
form
of
employment
preference
for
local
national
in
exchange
for
the
united
states'
right
to
use
military
facilities
located
in
the
host
country.
to
many
of
the
countries
with
which
we
have
such
agreements,
particularly
to
the
philippines,
the
united
states'
satisfaction
of
its
needs
for
civilian
employment
of
local
nationals
is
a
significant
quid
pro
quo
for
the
host
countries
permitting
the
united
states
to
use
facilities
located
on
its
sovereign
territory;
yet
no
here
in
the
legislative
history
is
even
one
of
these
international
agreements
mentioned,
much
less
did
congress
express
any
concern
for
the
drastic
consequences
that
a
statute
placing
the
united
states
in
breach
of
such
agreements
could
have
on
this
nation's
continuing
access
to
necessary
strategic
facilities
or
on
the
united
states'
relations
with
the
contracting
countries
in
general.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
we
do
not.
congress
clearly
had
the
power
to
do
it.
no
consideration
was
even
given
to
the
impact
that
such
a
statute
would
have
on
the
credibility
of
the
united
states
in
the
larger
international
arena.
in
our
view
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
upset
relations
with
several
other
nations
and
risk
the
loss
of
valuable
military
facilities
abroad
without
devoting
some
consideration
and
discussion
to
those
consequences.
decision
after
decision
by
this
court
has
counseled
against
lightly
attributing
to
congress
an
intent
to
place
the
united
states
in
breach
of
its
international
obligations.
we
can
think
of
no
more
appropriate
occasion
for
the
application
of
that
well-settled
canon
of
construction
than
in
the
present
case.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
two
provisions
at
issue
are
irreconcilable.
to
be
sure,
if
they
were
entirely
inconsistent,
the
earlier
international
obligation
would
have
to
give
way
to
the
subsequent
statute,
not
withstanding
any
possible
military
or
international
repercussions.
but
here,
where
there
are
two
equally
reasonable
constructions
of
the
word
"treaty",
that
usage
should
he
chosen
which
will
place
the
united...
which
will
not
place
the
united
states
in
violation
of
international
obligations
that
congress
expressed
absolutely
no
intention
to
breach.
our
construction
of
the
word
106
fully
capable
of
meeting
the
goals
congress
sought
to
serve
by
its
enactment.
the
most
obvious
of
them
was
the
prevention
of
discrimination
against
americans
or
their
dependents
by
virtue
of
directives
by
individual
officers
such
as
the
unilateral
order
of
charles
phipps,
then
the
commanding
general
of
the
european
exchange
system
in
europe,
to
fill
european
exchange
system
positions
with
local
nationals
instead
of
american
dependents.
in
addition
to
the
legislative
debate's
focus
on
the
action
of
general
phipps,
which
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief,
the
very
fact
that
all
of
the
examples
listed
in
section
106...
officers
clubs,
postal
exchanges,
and
commissary
stores...
are
nonappropriated
fund
activities,
as
were
the
positions
within
general
phipps'
control,
suggests
that
it
was
indeed
his
action
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
that
provision.
since
congress'
enactment
of
section
106,
the
executive
branch
has
continued
to
negotiate
and
enter
into
non-article
ii
agreements
that
provide
some
form
of
local
national
preference.
each
of
these
agreements
has
been
transmitted
to
congress
pursuant
to
the
case
act,
and
no
member
of
congress
has
expressed
concern
to
the
department
of
state
that
either
these
later
agreements
or
any
of
the
pre-existing
agreements
runs
afoul
of
section
106.
moreover,
subsequent
congresses
have
encouraged
the
executive
branch
to
review
and
attempt
to
renegotiate
existing
international
agreements
in
order
to
enhance
employment
opportunities
for
united
states
citizens
and
dependents
overseas,
but
only
to
the
extent
feasible.
nowhere
is
there
any
suggestion
that
this
prodding
of
the
executive
branch
is
based
on
any
perception
that
the
continued
employment
of
local
nationals
pursuant
to
non-article
ii
treaties
violates
section
106.
to
the
contrary,
these
exhortations
assume
the
continuing
existence
and
vitality
of
non-article
ii
agreements
providing
for
local
national
preferences,
notwithstanding
section
106;
and
they
nearly
urge
the
executive
branch
to
do
what
it
can
within
the
recognized
constraints
on
it
to
ameliorate
the
shortage
of
jobs
available
to
american
citizens
and
dependents
overseas.
this
post-enactment
legislative
history
suggests
that
another
purpose
congress
may
have
had
in
enacting
section
106,
a
purpose
that
also
fully
comports
with
the
use
of
the
word
"treaty"
in
its
broader
sense,
was
simply
to
let
the
executive
branch
know
that
congress
was
concerned
there
were
more...
i'm
sorry...
that
there
were
not
more
jobs
available
to
united
states
citizens
and
dependents
on
military
bases
abroad.
by
the
treaty
exception
contained
in
section
106
congress
recognized
the
necessity
in
some
cases
for
the
executive
to
offer
the
quid
pro
quo
of
local
national
employment
in
order
to
secure
the
use
of
strategically
necessary
military
facilities.
nevertheless,
congress
was
sending
the
executive
branch
a
message
which
it
was
to
repeat
in
the
future,
to
the
effect
that
were
possible,
it
should
attempt
to
avoid
reducing
the
number
of
jobs
available
to
americans.
construing
the
word
106
as
extending
to
all
binding
international
agreements
renders
both
the
ban
on
employment
discrimination
contained
in
that
provision
and
the
treaty
exception
to
it
reasonable
and
meaningful.
by
contrast,
to
construe
the
word
ii
treaties,
as
respondents
urge,
would
vitiate
the
treaty
exception
altogether
since,
as
respondents
concede,
there
were
no
article
ii
treaties
that
provided
for
local
national
employment
preferences
at
the
time
section
106
was
enacted,
and
any
subsequent
article
ii
treaty
that
might
do
so
could
supersede
a
previous
inconsistent
statute.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
but
most
significantly,
to
construe
the
word
"treaty"
in
its
narrow
constitutional
sense
when
the
equally
reasonable,
broader
construction
is
available
is
unnecessarily
to
attribute
to
congress
a
purpose
to
bring
about
drastic
international
and
military
consequences
that
congress
never
once
indicated
it
intended.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
just
have
a
few
points
to
make.
the
fact
that
the
discrimination
that
occurred
as
a
result
of
general
phipps'
action
was
done
in
contravention
of
then
existing
law
leaves
room
for
section
106
to
apply
in
the
future
to
other
examples
of
discrimination
that
could
be
done
also
in
contravention
of
existing
law.
although...
while
it's
true
that
the
same
92nd
congress
that
enacted
section
106
also
enacted
the
case
act,
number
one,
the
case
act
was
referred
to
in
the
conference,
in
the
report
on
it
as
only
for
informational
purposes;
and
moreover,
there's
no
hint
whatsoever
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
106
that
there
was
any
concern
behind
that
legislation
with
any
presidential
abuse
of
the
executive
agreement
power.
with
respect
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
the
only
agreement
in
europe
at
the
time
section
106
was
passed
was
an
agreement
with
iceland,
and
that...
no,
iceland
did
not
arise
in
the
discussion
of
section
106.
in
fact,
the
discussion
centered
around
discrimination
that
was
going
on
in
germany.
and
as
we
pointed
out
before,
the
nato
sofa
which
controlled
the
german
situation
did
not
provide
any
local
national
employment
preferences,
nor
did
it
classify
jobs
as
local
national
or
other
position.
in
effect,
what
general
phipps
was
doing
was
exactly
to
classify
jobs
as
local
nationals,
because
he
took
4,000
positions
that
had
been
held
by
americans
and
said
he
wanted
to
have
them
filled
by
local
nationals.
just
to
clarify,
the
exhortations
by
stevenson
were
in
the
legislative
history,
the
subsequent
legislative
history,
not
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
106
itself.
and
indeed,
the
exhortation
to
hire
more
dependents
was
one
within
the
constraint
of
existing
agreements.
also,
with
respect
to
the
need...
the
point
we
have
made
for
a
need
for
a
showing
of
intent
to
abrogate,
we
agree
where
two
enactments
are
clearly
inconsistent,
irreconcilable,
then
there's
no
question
that
the
earlier
must
give
way
to
the
later;
but
whereas
here
there
are
two
possible
constructions,
then
you
do
look
for
an
intent
to
abrogate,
and
in
the
absence
of
such
an
intent,
then
you
try
to
read
the
two
statutes
together.
with
respect
to
the
case
act
provision
and
why
if
we
believe
our
agreements
are
treaties
within
the
meaning
of
section
106
we
submit
those
agreements
under
the
case
act,
the
case
act
would
have
no
meaning
unless
international
agreements
were
what
was
supposed
to
be
submitted
under
it,
international
agreements
other
than
article
ii
treaties,
because
the
senate
at
least
would
already
have
been
aware
of
article
ii
treaties.
