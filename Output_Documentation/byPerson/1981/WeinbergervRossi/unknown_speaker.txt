unknown
speaker
ms.
etkind,
as
of
this
date
has
that
agreement
been
amended?
unknown
speaker
okay.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
is
it
accepted
by
everyone
that
that's
a
binding
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
valid
agreement
without
senate
approval?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
have...
how
can
you
tell
the
difference
between
an
agreement
and
a
treaty,
on
whether
he
seeks
senate
confirmation
or
not?
unknown
speaker
in
the
restatement?
unknown
speaker
does
that
bind
us?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
some...
do
we
have
some
cases
on
executive
agreements?
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
this
kind
of
agreement
though?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
way
of
telling
at
a
glance
whether
an
executive
agreement
has
to
have
senate
approval
before
it
becomes
binding
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
about
this
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
authority
to
say
that
those
are
agreements,
valid
agreements,
rather
than
treaties,
or
is
that
just...
that's
just
the
view
of
the
united
states,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
ms.
etkind,
in
this
particular
instance
did
not
congress
in
1944
pass
specific
legislation
authorizing
the
president
to
negotiate
this
agreement
with
the
philippines?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
couldn't
waive
the
necessity
to
have
senate
approval
for
a
treaty,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
congress
couldn't
waive
the
necessity
for
having
senate
approval
for
a
treaty,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
was
whether
this
is
a
treaty
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
the
issue...
nobody
has
raised
the
issue
in
this
case
anyway,
so
i'm
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
anyway
the
question
is
whether
when
congress
used
"treaty"
in
this
statute
it
intended
to
include
what
have
come
to
be
known
as
executive
agreements,
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
possible
that
in
some
contexts
the
use
of
the
word
"treaty"
in
a
statute
might
include
exactly
these
agreements
made
without
the
approval
of
the
senate
and
in
other
contexts
it
might
not.
unknown
speaker
is
this
basically
any
different
from
construing
a
statute
as
to
the
intent
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
we're
confronted
with?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
a
fairly
unusual
situation
in
which
congress
passed
legislation
authorizing
the
president
to
enter
into
a
treaty
in
the
sense
of
a
document
that
requires
confirmation
and
ratification
by
the
senate,
too,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question?
isn't
it
also
a
question
of
what
the
word
"prohibited"
means?
unknown
speaker
because
the
treaty
surely
doesn't
prohibit
the
discrimination
it
refers
to,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
word
"prohibited"
we
should
construe
to
mean
"permitted".
is
that
the
position
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
it
is,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
otherwise,
i
agree,
but
that's
exactly,
it
seems
to
me,
exactly
what
you're
arguing:
"prohibited"
means
"permitted".
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute...
well...
or
is
it
required,
unless
required
by
treaty?
is
it
required
or
permitted?
what
is
it
that
the
word
means,
"prohibited"
is
supposed
to
mean?
unknown
speaker
so
"prohibited"
means
either
"required"
or
"permitted".
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
those
did
you
say
there
were,
miss--
unknown
speaker
--how
many
are
there
today?
unknown
speaker
does
the
legislative
history
tell
us
how
much
of
the
problem
at
that
time
was
the
result
of
local
agreements
by
commanding
officers
as
opposed
to
some
kind
of
executive
agreement
resulting
in
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
both
this
court
and
other
courts
have
construed
the
word
in
its
later
international
relations
sense
where
the
context
within
the
term
was
used
indicated
that
it
was
intended
to
carry
that
broader
meaning.
congress
even
has
used
the
word
ii
treaties,
and
when
congress
intends
to
refer
exclusively
to
article
ii
treaties,
it
can
be
quite
explicit.
congress
employed
no
such
precision
in
its
drafting
of
section
106.
well,
it
certainly
used...
sloppily
used
a
word
here,
didn't
it,
that
has
a
distinct
impression.
do
you
know
whether
any
constitutional
treaty,
any
treaty
in
the
constitutional
sense
has
ever
covered
an
agreement
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
so
these
local
hiring
things
have
always
been
by--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
question
the
power
of
congress
to
do
this
if
we
were
to
interpret
it
as
the
respondents
would
have
us
do
so?
unknown
speaker
without
the
proviso
that
begins
section
116,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
most
of
our
cases
here
are
just
the
reverse,
that
you
can't
get
a
job
because
you're
not
a
citizen.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
some
difference
in
the
setting
in
which
that
distinction
occurs
and
the
reasons
for
it?
unknown
speaker
if
we
couldn't
get
bases
in
foreign
countries
on
any
other
terms,
is
there
any
question
about
the
soundness
of
doing
it
that
way,
laying
aside
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
only
be
for
the
future,
though,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
this...
this
philippine
one.
if
we
agree
with
you,
i
gather
it's
completely
ineffective,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
could
be
effective,
i
gather,
under
your
submission
only
for
the
future,
if
it
went
to
the
congress
and
the
congress
then
modified
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
colleague
said
that
there
were
about
4,000
jobs
at
stake,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
are
all
of
them
pursuant
to
agreements
like
this?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
there
just
weren't
that
many
americans
in
any
event
available
to
fill
the
jobs.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
this
only
apply
to
subic
bay
in
the
philippines,
because
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
americans
in
other
jobs
over
there.
in
manila,
for
example,
there
are
thousands.
unknown
speaker
does
this
agreement
apply
to
them,
too?
unknown
speaker
everybody
in
the
philippines.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
since
the
passage
of
section
106
there
are
no
more
local
agreements
entered
into
by
commanding
officers?
do
we
know
that?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
that
in
using
the
word
1962
memo,
when
congress
enacted
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
jumped
from
there
to
the
conclusion
that
that's
what
congress
meant?
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
you
referred
to
nonappropriated
fund
activities.
now,
that's
post
exchanges
essentially,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
employees
in
the
staff
headquarters,
civilian
employees
in
staff
headquarters
and
so
forth
are
not
covered
by
that
phrase--
unknown
speaker
--"#
nonappropriated
fund
activities".
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
the
officers'
club.
another
example.
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
px
employment
is
all
nonappropriated
funds?
unknown
speaker
but
there
still
will
be
a
problem
if
we
upheld
the
court
of
appeals,
wouldn't
there,
an
international
problem?
unknown
speaker
between
the
philippines...
well,
are
you
going
to
tell
the
philippines
that
the
agreement
is
no
good?
they
negotiated
it,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't...
you
mean
they're
just
going
to
sit
quietly
by?
unknown
speaker
it'll
be
a
pretty
good
problem,
won't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
rhetoric
goes
back
a
little
ways.
unknown
speaker
fifty
years.
unknown
speaker
where
there's--
unknown
speaker
--well,
wasn't
there
within
the
last
year
a
problem
that
they
might
not
renew
the
whole
agreement?
unknown
speaker
that
marcos
said
he
wasn't
going
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
same
kind
of
rhetoric
that
starts
wars.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are...
you
want
the
protection
for
a
double
dipper,
and
there
are
some
people
in
the
philippines,
80
percent,
who
from
the
time
they're
born
until
they
die
they
never
see
a
doctor
or
a
nurse.
you
know,
they
need
a
little
something,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
man's
already...
he's
living
on...
he's
got
retirement
money,
and
he's
taking
a
job
that
otherwise
would
go
to
a
native.
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
doubt
you'll
find
any
dispute
that
the
question
is
one
for
congress
to
address.
the
question
is
what
has
it
said.
and
it
strikes
me
that
your
construction
of
the
word
"treaty"
could
be
an
implied
proviso
to
every
act
of
congress,
because
everybody
knows
that
a
treaty
will
supersede
a
statute
if
it's
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
this
section
106
didn't
have
the
language
"unless
prohibited
by
treaty"
but
simply
had
the
provision
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
against
by
the
department
of
defense
or
any
other
officer
or
employee
thereof.
now,
if
congress
later...
the
senate
later
ratified
a
treaty
containing
just
the
language
of
the
base
agreement
with
the
philippines,
certainly
that
would
supersede
this,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
the
92nd
congress?
unknown
speaker
or
unless
he
was
referring
to
area
commanders
agreements.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
don't
think
he
was--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
a
possible--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
arguing,
mr.
mott,
in
effect
that
congress
really
intended
to
amend
or
to
eliminate
provisions
that
existed
in
a
dozen
agreements.
is
there
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
consequences
of
its
action
if
the
action
was
intended
to
do
what
you
say?
unknown
speaker
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
testimony
on
this
subject
presented
to
the
senate
committee?
unknown
speaker
that
related
specifically
to
the
base
agreements?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
mott,
does
it
not
prevent
by
congressional
enactment
the
possibility
of
a
changed
defense
policy
that
would
allow
local
commanders
to
enter
into
such
agreements?
unknown
speaker
it
would
at
least
accomplish
that,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
always
have
the
same
policy
makers--
unknown
speaker
--governing
the
department
of
defense.
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
any
other
situations
in
which
congress
was
held
to
have
invalidated,
without
even
mentioning
the
fact,
a
number
of
international
agreements?
unknown
speaker
let's
see
if
i
fully
understand
you,
mr.
mott.
when
you
say
that
congress
intended
by
160
to
correct
a
situation,
now,
define
what
that
situation
is
that
was
corrected.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
but
part
of
the
situation,
i
gather,
at
the
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
160,
you
say,
is
there
were
already
outstanding
a
number
of
executive
agreements.
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
is
there
in
the
legislative
history
to
say
that
in
correcting
the
situation
by
160
congress
intended
to
supersede
those
agreements?
unknown
speaker
well,
waltman
said
differently,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
waltman
did
treat
"treaty"
differently,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
that
was
on
the
books
when
all
this
happened.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--i
know.
but
ii
treaties.
unknown
speaker
now,
that's
your
one.
what's
the
other
two?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
recognition
in
the
history
of
the
existence
of
agreements
with
countries?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
would
be
true
only
under
those
agreements?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
for
us
to
adopt
your
submission
we'd
have
to
agree
with
you,
don't
we,
that
"correct
situation"
included
superseding
those
agreements,
do
we
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mott,
did
not
the
same
congress
that
passed
section
106
use
the
same
term
"treaty"
in
another
act
where
it's
been
determined
that
they
used
it
in
the
broader
sense?
unknown
speaker
the
case
act.
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
take
any
position
on
this
legislation
while
it
was
in
congress?
unknown
speaker
--what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
blame
them
then,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
you
think
that
congress
would
have
objected
when
they
were
submitted
if
in
fact
they
were
simply
international
agreements?
unknown
speaker
so
there
really
hasn't
been
any
action
by
congress
as
a
whole
to
overturn
the
government's
position
on
this.
unknown
speaker
it
could
pass
a
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
if
congress
is
concerned
about
what
the
government
is
doing
here
it
can
simply
pass
a
law
and
say
we
want
to
remove
all
ambiguity.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mott,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
senate
report
or
the
conference
comittee
report
about
correcting
the
situation?
they
said
the
situation
primarily
in
europe,
and
how
many
of
these
12
agreements
which
were
then
in
effect
affected
europe
and
how
many
affected
other
parts
of
the
world?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
no
executive
agreement
affecting
germany,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
and
that,
of
course...
that,
of
course,
was
ratified
by
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
the
status
of
forces
agreement?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
