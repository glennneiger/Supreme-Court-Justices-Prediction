unknown
speaker
how
much
time
do
these
physicians
spend
in
this
process
as
compared
with
the
time
they
spend
taking
care
of
the
patients?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
of
some
kind
at
the
time
the
case
began?
unknown
speaker
about
some
other
kinds
of
movements.
unknown
speaker
and
that
dispute
was
settled?
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
then
why
didn't
the
case
end
there?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
the
court
to
end
it
then?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
the
court
to
end
the
case
then?
unknown
speaker
and
you
went
right
ahead
and
litigated
these
other
issues?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
raising
a
case
or
controversy
here
for
the
first
time?
unknown
speaker
but
you
submitted
these
issues
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
mean,
you
litigated
those
issues
without
objection
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
the
question
were
properly
before
the
lower
courts,
dealing
with
the
transfer
to
a
higher
level
of
care,
would
new
york
have
stipulated
eventually
to
the
procedures
for
handling
them
as
was
done
on
transfers
to
lower
level
of
care?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
your
answer
is
no
from
advice
of
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
you
have,
i
think,
taken
the
position
in
your
brief
that
private
transfer
decisions
for
patients
in
nursing
homes
are
medical
decisions
unaffected
by
the
state.
now,
what
about
a
decision
by
the
nursing
home
itself
to
transfer,
when
made
by
someone
other
than
a
physician?
is
that
a
medical
decision?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
while
you
are
interrupted.
do
transfer
decisions,
even
those
made
by
private
physicians,
have
to
be
made
by
applying
state-defined
criteria?
unknown
speaker
can
a
patient
be
transferred
who
does
not
meet
the
state's
criteria?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
gordon,
we
have
granted
certiorari
on
just
two
questions
here,
relatively
narrow,
and
about
half
of
your
time
is
gone.
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
focus
on
those
two
questions.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
purport
to
be
transfers
of
named
parties
to
the
action?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
too
deeply
in
the
state
action
argument
because
it
is
hard
for
me
to
keep
these
proceedings
clearly
in
mind,
in
the
prior
proceeding
that
is
not
now
before
us
which
involved,
as
i
understand,
downward
decisions
by
a
urc
and
which
might
result
i
guess
in
the
discharge
of
a
patient
from
a
nursing
home,
was
it
decided
that
there
was
state
action
involved
there?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
hearing
requirement
was
imposed
by
federal
regulation.
unknown
speaker
now
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question.
the
last
section
of
your
opponent's
brief,
as
i
remember
it,
and
i
have
not
glanced
at
it
right
now,
suggests
that
federal
regulations
or
state
regulations
require
hearings
on
everything
that
is
before
us
now.
are
those
the
same
regulations
that
govern
your
decision
in
the
downward
urc
transfers?
or
do
they
apply
to
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
get
this
one
question
out
and
then
i
will...
why,
if
there
is
a
urc
decision
to
increase
the
level
of
care
which
would
require
moving
patient
from
one
place
to
another
and
which
might
give
rise
to
this
phenomenon
of
transfer
trauma,
why
wouldn't
the
regulation
apply
to
that?
because
it
would
be,
in
effect,
a
denial
of
the
existing
care.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
sanctions
which
the
state
attaches
to
a
violation
of
what
you
describe
as
its
command?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
a
public
health
type
of
regulation
where
they
would
shut
down
the
facility
if
they
failed
to
comply,
i
take
it.
it
is
more
like
a
regulation
governing
a
contractor
with
the
state.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
the
nursing
home
is
perfectly
free
to
say
we
will
go
without
the
money
and
operate
as
we
choose.
unknown
speaker
so
supposing
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
contracted
for
the
production
of
20,000
envelopes
or
something
like
that
with
a
contract,
and
it
has
certain
sanctions
attaching
to
the
contractor's
failing
to
comply
with
certain
production
regulations.
now,
if
the
contractor
does
not
comply,
he
will
not
get
paid
by
the
state
of
new
york,
but
you
would
not
say
that
the
contractor
is
commanded
to
comply
with
those
regulations.
unknown
speaker
and
the
sanction
is
not
that
the
facility
becomes
unlicensed
or
goes
to
jail,
but
simply
that
money
is
cut
off
which
it
otherwise
would
have
received.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
fine?
unknown
speaker
so
it
does
have
some
aspects
of
a
public
health
regulation,
then?
unknown
speaker
do
those
sanctions
apply,
counsel,
to
a
failure
to
move
the
patient
up
to
a
higher,
more
expensive
level
of
care?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
still
have
the
problem
of
the
fact
that
the
decision
to
transfer
is
not
the
state's,
at
least
in
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
right,
so
that
the
standard
is
applied
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
but
the
decision
is
made
not
by
a
state
official
but
by
a
private
party,
and
you
have
to,
nevertheless,
say
that
that
private
action
is
state
action.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
your
bridge?
how
do
you
get
to
that?
unknown
speaker
compelling
what?
unknown
speaker
they
compel
the
decision
to
be
made.
unknown
speaker
then
they
provide
the
standards.
unknown
speaker
not
until
the
decision
is
made.
by
a
private
party.
you
still
have
to
decide
that
the
decision
is
a
state
decision.
unknown
speaker
initiative?
this
is
the
decision...
the
decision
that
someone
needs
less
or
more
care.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
decision
i
am
talking
about.
is
that...
and
you
must
claim
that
that
is
a
state
decision.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
the
enforcement
mechanism
is
the...
involves
the
state
sufficiently
to
be
blamed
for
the
decision
to
transfer
or
to...
to
some
other
facility.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
inquire,
is
this
argument
limited
to
nursing
homes?
say
you
had
a
hospital
and
the
state...
say
there
is
a
shortage
of
hospital
beds
and
rooms
so
the
state
passes
a
law
and
says
that
when
a
patient
reaches
a
certain
level
of
recuperation
that
the
hospital
must
discharge
him
if
the
doctor
thinks
it
is
okay
to
do
so.
would
those
be
state
decisions
to
discharge?
say
a
mother
delivers
a
child...
must
be
discharged
in
48
hours--
unknown
speaker
--would
those
decisions
then
by
the
doctor
to
say
well,
you
are
well
enough
to
go
home
be
a
state
decision,
under
your
analysis?
unknown
speaker
or
say
they
had
a
state
law
that
said
don't
prescribe
a
certain
drug
unless
certain
symptoms
are
present...
don't
give
him
too
much
aspirin.
and
everytime
a
doctor
prescribes
aspirin,
is
that
state
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
my
hypothetical
i
was
assuming
it
was
a
firm
requirement
of
law.
you
just
do
not
over-prescribe
medicine,
don't
keep
people
in
the
hospital
too
long;
otherwise,
you
will
be
sanctioned
by
fines
and
all
the
rest.
that
would
make
it
a
state
action
everytime
the
doctor--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kirklin,
that
is
the
point.
i
thought
we
were
dealing
here
only
with
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care.
i
thought
that
was
what
was
left
and
what
we
were
concerned
with.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
the
briefs,
the
questions
that
we
have
here
involved
only
the
questions
of
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care,
and
secondly,
whether
there
was
an
article
iii
standing
problem.
i
thought
those
were
the
two
questions.
now,
the
court
resolved
below
the
question
of
simply
terminating
the
care
altogether
or
assigning
the
patient
to
a
lower
level
of
care.
and
in
fact,
the
parties
stipulated
that
in
those
situations,
a
fair
hearing
would
be
required.
and
i
understood
that
the
litigation
below
and
your
argument
below
was
based
on
the
reduction
of
benefits
that
would
ensue,
and
that
gave
the
state
its
financial
interest.
now,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
higher
level
of
care,
the
state
does
not
have
the
same
interest;
it
is
going
to
cost
the
state
a
lot
more
money,
and
they
are
not
eager
to
send
some
patient
to
a
higher
level
of
care
and
pay
more
money.
so
now
you
are
making
a
totally
new
argument
that
i
understand
was
not
made
in
the
courts
below
at
all;
that
because
of
state
regulation
on
the
standards,
that
that
makes
the
physician's
decision
state
action.
have
i
summarized
it
correctly?
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
gordon
informed
us...
and
maybe
i
misunderstood
her...
that
the
injunction
prohibited
the
nursing
homes
from
doing
just
that.
was
i
wrong
in
understanding
that?
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
no
longer
required
to
because
they
were
freed
of
the
compulsion,
as
i
understood
it,
of
the
urc
determination.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
to
put
it
differently,
weren't
they
free
to
say
we
are
going
to
keep
this
patient
here
and
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do
to
us
if
we
do.
unknown
speaker
they
were
not?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
prohibitant
from
doing
it
right
now?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
a
hearing?
a
state
hearing?
unknown
speaker
the
state
had
to
provide
a
hearing
forum
to
decide
as
to
whether
a
private
hospital
could
change
its
status
of
a
patient?
unknown
speaker
what
federal
law
says
that
in
this
case,
in
this
posture,
with
this
injunction,
cannot
do
it?
what
federal
law
says
that
hospital
a
privately-owned,
privately-financed,
cannot
change
the
status
of
a
patient?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
federal
law
now.
unknown
speaker
what
federal
law
requires
a
private
hospital
to
give
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
was
not
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
the
constitutional
basis,
and
i
thought
your
submission
was
constitutional,
too.
i
thought
your
answer
might
be
to
justice
marshall,
it
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
requires
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
you
now
say
it
is
the
federal
regulation.
unknown
speaker
you
were
trying
to
get
a
private
hospital,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
what
i
understood
you
to
be
trying
to
do.
unknown
speaker
it
sure
is.
if
you
are
right
about
the
regulations,
we
really
should
not
reach
any
constitutional
questions
here.
unknown
speaker
did
you
talk
about
the
regulations
before
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
they...
did
they
reject
your
view
of
the
regulations?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
they
didn't?
they
just
did
not
write
about
it.
unknown
speaker
v-11,
if
they
were
construing...
deciding
the
case
in
an
orthodox
manner,
if
they
reached
the
constitutional
question
they
must
have
rejected
your
claim
under
the
regulations
because
presumably,
they
do
not
reach
a
constitutional
question
if
there
is
a
statutory
or
a
regulation
way
of
disposing
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
so
they
rejected
your
regulatory
submission?
unknown
speaker
was
it
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
on
both
sides?
unknown
speaker
was
the
department...
did
the
federal
people
take
any
position
on
the
matter
as
amicus?
unknown
speaker
how
did
they
construe
their
own
regulations?
or
do
you
know?
or
is
it
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
insofar
as
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care
are
concerned...
and
i
still
think
that
is
one
of
the
issues
before
us,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
is
not
the
federal
position
that
no
hearing
is
required
for
the
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care?
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that,
so
you
are
not
here
making
that
argument
to
us,
that
it
is
required
by
federal
regulation.
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
you
are
saying
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you
and
the
petitioners
differ
on
whether
the
consent
decree
covers
those
transfers
to
a
lower
level
or
out--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
did
argue
below
only
on
the
basis
of
the
reduction
in
financial
benefits
as
the
basis
for
holding
that
there
was
state
action,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not...
i
take
it
your
submission
here
on
the
state
action
is
not...
certainly
is
not
in
defense
of
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
the
state
enforces
a
decision.
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
then
if
there
was
a
general
state
law
about
trespass
or
something,
and
the
home
decides
to
move
a
patient
and
the
patient
refuses
to
go,
so
the
court...
so
the
home
goes
to
court
and
gets
an
order,
just
for
self-protection
gets
an
order
to
move
the
person
out.
that
is
state
enforcement
of
the
private
decision.
would
you
say
that
is
automatically
state
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
trespass
action
would
not
give
any
hearing
on
the
validity
of
the
private
decision;
it
would
just
say
are
you
here
without
consent.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
general
law
says
a
person
cannot
stay
on
somebody
else's
property
without
consent.
and
a
court
will
enforce
it.
unknown
speaker
or
to
raise
the
standards,
you
said
before.
if
you
enhance
the
care,
given
them
higher
care,
more
benefits,
you
also
have
to
have
a
due
process
hearing.
unknown
speaker
on
that
theory
you
would
be
saying
that
under
goldberg
against
kelly,
if
some
welfare
director
wants
to
increase
the
welfare
payments
to
a
recipient
they
would
have
to
have
a
hearing,
a
goldberg
v.
kelly
hearing.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
property
interest
if
the
transfer
is
to
a
higher
level
of
care?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you
what
the
property
interest
is.
do
you
have
a
property
interest
if
somebody
wants
to
give
you
more
money?
a
property
interest,
to
decline
it?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that
that
makes
them
think
they
are
dying?
is
there
something
in
the
record,
a
medical
opinion
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
no
trauma
involved
in
an
adversary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
the
hearing...
the
chief
justice's
question
makes
me
wonder,
her
could
the
pre-transfer
hearing
provide
protection
against
this
concern
you
expressed
about
the
consequences
of
a
transfer
to
a
higher
level?
if
the
reason
is
that
there
is
greater
danger
of
mortality,
does
that...
how
does
it
help
to
make
them
spell
it
out
in
a
hearing
for
the
man
or
woman?
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
be
in
part.
i
mean,
if
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
you
are
saying
the
patient
must
be
given
the
bad
news
in
detail,
is
what
you
are
saying.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
case
at
all
like
that
in
this
record
before
us?
unknown
speaker
i
can
imagine
some
cases
with
extreme
facts
might
present
a
problem,
but
do
we
have
to
decide...
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
requires
us
to
decide
a
case
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
yes.
where
it
is
harmful
to
the
patient
to
give
him
the
added
protection.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
are
any
of
those
litigants
that
are
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
kirklin.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mrs.
gordon?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
before
you
start,
are
the
grey
panthers
parties
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
listed
as
parties?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
gordon,
if
you
will
stay
on
the
microphone
we
will
hear
you
better.
unknown
speaker
now,
rules
require
that
the
parties
be
identified.

they
identified
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown

not
find
that
they
were
included
in
the
list
of
parties
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
were
they

not?
maybe

the
other
side

tell
us.
unknown
speaker
where,
what
page?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
right,
i

not
want

detain
you.
unknown

unknown

mrs.
gordon,
on
this
matter
of
the
grey
panthers,
this
petition
is
yours,
isn't
it,
the
state's?
unknown
speaker
and
it
says
barabara
blum,
et
cetera,
against...
and
it
names
a
number
of
people...
and
the
grey
panthers,
new
york
chapter.
unknown
speaker
you
thought...
when
this
was
filed
you
thought
they
were
respondents,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
mentions
them.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
judgment
that
is
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
they
here?
unknown
speaker
they
are
here
also
as
technically
in
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
not
quite
technical;
that
is
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
made
any
objection
to
that,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
and
where
did
you
raise
that
objection?
right
now?
unknown
speaker
you
raised
it
now.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
raise
it
before.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
a
little
late?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
bound
by
your
serious
conversations
with
your
solicitor
general.
