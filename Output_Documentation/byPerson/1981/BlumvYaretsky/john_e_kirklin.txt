mr.
john
e.
kirklin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
contend
that
the
record
in
this
case
clearly
discloses
the
existence
of
a
justiciable
controversy
between
the
parties.
the
justiciability
inquiry
focuses
properly
on
three
main
areas
of
concerns:
the
circumstances
of
the
named
plaintiffs
at
the
time
of
the
consent
judgment,
the
joint
pretrial
order
in
this
case,
and
the
standing
allegations
of
the
organizational
plaintiff,
the
grey
panthers.
with
the
entry
of
the
consent
judgment,
which
ended
the
implementation
of
adverse
utilization
review
committee
determinations,
the
named
plaintiffs
and
class
members
came
under
the
immediate
threat
of
being
transferred
out
of
their
facilities
by
the
facilities
themselves.
it
is
the
unequivocal
command
of
applicable
state
law
that
a
nursing
facility
must
promptly
transfer,
without
a
hearing,
any
medicaid
patient
who
is
thought
not
to
need
that
level
of
care.
thus,
section
505.20
of
the
state
department
of
social
services
regulations
state
simply
and
clearly
that
patients
who
no
longer
need
skilled
nursing
or
health-related
facility
care
shall
be
discharged
promptly.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
your
honor,
the
penalties
that
can
ensue
if
a
facility
fails
to
promptly
discharge
a
medicaid
patient
are
retroactive
denial
of
reimbursement
for
services
rendered,
fines
and
suspension
from
the
medicaid
program
itself.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
i
imagine
that
might
be
the
case.
what
is
significant
is
that
the
state
commands
the
result;
it
backs
it
up
with
certain
kinds
of
sanctions.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
well,
your
honor,
we
assume
that
nursing
homes,
like
everybody
else,
will
comply
with
the
law.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
let
me
distinguish
two
situations,
it
might
be
helpful.
if
a
private
doctor,
for
example,
were
providing
services
to
a
medicaid
patient
and
the
state,
as
in
your
hypothetical,
declined
retroactively
to
pay
the
physician,
it
is
true
that
the
physician
might,
in
the
future,
decline
to
provide
services.
now,
that
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
what
happens
here.
the
state
here
does
not
just
say
that
if
you
do
not
do
something,
we...
it
does
not
simply
say
we
are
retroactively
possibly
going
to
deny
compensation
for
services
rendered.
it
directly
requires...
it
specifically
says
to
the
facility
if
that
patient
do
not
need
that
level
of
care,
you
shall
promptly
discharge
that
patient
without
a
hearing.
it
has
behind
it
obviously
certain
sanctions
like
any
affirmative
command
of
the
state,
but
it
is
the
nature
of
that
command
which
does
not
just
impose
an
indirect
harm
on
the
patient,
but
it
interferes
directly
with
that
patient's
right
to
be
in
that
facility.
the
conduct
of
the
government,
directly
commands
that
the
facility
must
move
the
patient.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
more
than
that,
your
honor.
the
facility
stands
not
just
to
lose
compensation
for
services
rendered;
it
stands
to
be
fined,
it
stands
to
lose
its
right
to
participate
in
the
medicaid
program.
and
that
is
pretty
serious
in
the
state
of
new
york
because
more
than
90
%
of
the
patients
in
nursing
facilities
in
new
york
state
are
medicaid
patients.
literally,
the
facility
depends
for
its
very
survival
being
part
of
the
medicaid
program.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
the
fines
i
believe,
your
honor,
can
be
up
to
$1000
a
day
for
violations.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
to
that
extent
i
guess
it
does.
but
in
addition
there
are
these
other
serious
sanctions.
and
sanctions
which,
if
applied
with--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
state
regulation
that
i
cited
at
505.20
specifically
requires
a
facility
to
move
a
patient
who
does
not
need
that
level
of
care.
the
regulations
of
the
state
department
of
health
additionally
say
that
a
facility
must
promptly
transfer
a
patient
whose
care
is
inadequate;
that
is,
who
should
be
moved
to
a
higher
level
of
care.
further,
those
same
regulations
require
that
a
patient
must
be
promptly
moved,
again
without
a
hearing,
if
the
patient
is
otherwise
inappropriately
placed
because
of
a
behavior
problem,
emotional
disorder,
some
other
problem
that
jeopardizes
the
welfare
of
that
patient
or
of
other
patients
in
the
facility.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
in
some
sense,
it
is
the
state's,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
the
regulation
that
i
cited
of
the
state
department
of
social
services
also
states
that
the
facility's
judgment
about
whether
a
patient
needs
a
level
of
care
as
provided
there
must
be
based
on
the
assessment
of
that
patient
as
against
the
state's
long-term
care
assessment
form,
called
the
dms-1.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
is
right,
your
honor,
and
we--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--the
bridge,
your
honor,
is
the
argument
that
when
the
state
puts
its
weight
on
the
side
of
private
conduct,
even
if
that
initiative
comes
from
a
private
party,
by
ordering
it,
by
compelling
it,
by
directing
it--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--compelling
the
facility--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--more
than
that.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
more
than
that.
the
state
requires
that
the
facility
kick
the
patient
out.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
respondents
contend
that
where...
even
if
the
initiative
came
from
a
private
party--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--the
decision,
the
standard
is
whether
the
person
needs
that
level
of
care.
that
is
correct.
that
is
no
different
than--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--we
submit
that
when
the
state
enforces
that
result
by
requiring
the
facility
to
kick
the
patient
out,
the
state
is
involved.
and
that
eviction
of
the
patient
from
the
facility
is
sufficient
to
require
the
state...
when
a
state
requires
it,
the
state
should
hold
a
hearing
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
applicable
federal
and
state
law
which
prohibits
a
facility
from
kicking
out
an--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--that
is
our
primary
argument;
that
when
the
state
directs--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--i
think
it
is
true
that
there
are
similar
requirements
for
medicaid
patients.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
yes.
we
maintain
that
if
the
state,
again,--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--again,
your
honor,
the
difference
there
is
that
the
state
does
not
tell
a
doctor,
you
cannot
provide
care
that
you
think
is
required.
it
would
merely
say
in
the
case
of
a
medicaid
patient
that
perhaps
retroactively,
you
will
not
be
paid
for
that.
the
state
does
more
here,
and
that
is
the
point
that--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--no,
it
would
not,
because
we
maintain
there
is
a
difference--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--the
difference
is
this:
that
if
the
state
merely
said
in
this
case
to
a
nursing
facility,
you
ought
not
to
provide
inappropriate
care,
with
the
consequences
that
might
follow,
that
if
they
did
so
they
might
not
be
paid,
we
do
not
insist
that
that
is
state
action.
it
is
state
action,
though,
when
the
state
goes
beyond
that
and
says
to
the
facility,
if
that
patient
is
improperly
there,
kick
him
out
immediately
without
a
hearing,
indeed
the
whole
incentive...
the
incentive
of
the
state
to
do
this
is
self-evident.
it
is
a
cost-containment
concern.
it
is
not
a
concern
that
the
facility--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--it
is
not
just
that
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
your
honor,
let
me
explain
what
happened
below.
there
was
a
consent
judgment;
that
consent
judgment
resolved
the
controversy
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants
about
implementation
of
utilization
review
committee
determinations.
ms.
gordon
has
explained
utilization
review
committees.
those
determinations
were
to
discharge
a
patient,
transfer
him
to
a
lower
level
of
care.
we
settled
that.
the
state
said
we
are
not
going
to
enforce
those
determinations;
they
are
too
traumatic,
they
are
too
harmful
to
the
patient.
now,
what
that
left
was
the
following:
it
left
the
facilities
themselves
capable...
not
only
capable
but
required,
as
i
have
explained...
to
move
those
patients
if
they
do
not
need
that
level
of
care.
the
state
never
maintained
these
people
did
not
need
that
level
of
care,
the
state
never
retreated
from
its
support
of
the
so
called
dms-1
instrument
as
a
way
of
assessing
that
level
of
care.
when
the
utilization
review
committee
route
to
moving
patients
was
closed,
then
these
plaintiffs
came
under
the
threat
of
the
state
law
that
i
described,
that
facilities
must
promptly
move
them.
before
that
time,
the
facilities
could
rely
upon
the
utilization
review
process
as
a
way
of
moving
in
appropriately
placed
patients.
now,
both
parties
in
the
lower
court
understood
full
well
that
the
threat
that
the
facilities
themselves
would
move
these
patients
crystallized
with
the
entry
of
the
consent
judgment.
with
the
entry
of
the
consent
judgment,
which
the
state
resisted
up
to
the
last
minute,
the
utilization
review
route
was
suddenly
closed
shut
as
a
way
to
move
these
plaintiffs.
each
one
of
these
plaintiffs,
though,
had
been
assessed
against
the
state's
dms-1
instrument
and
had
been
found
by
that
evaluation
which
the
plaintiffs
challenged,
not
to
need
that
level
of
care.
now,
with
a
consent
judgment
entered,
the
only
way
that
the
facilities
could
comply
with
the
requirement
of
state
law
that
they
must
promptly
without
a
hearing
move
inappropriately-placed
patients
was
to
move
them
themselves.
the
utilization
review
route
was
closed.
the
plaintiffs
moved
quickly
when
that
threat
existed
to
have
the
issue
adjudicated
simply
because
any
delay
in
the
resolution
of
that
question
obviously
carried
with
it
the
serious
risk
that
these
transfers
would
be
accomplished--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
situation.
by
the
consent
judgment,
the
state
agreed
that
for
its
part,
it
would
not
approve
or
enforce
adverse
utilization
review
committee
determinations.
the
consent
judgment
left
facilities
free
to
move
patients,
and
indeed,
the
state--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--they
were
free
of
the
obligation...
when
the
state
adopts
the
urc's--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--no.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
they
were
not.
the
state
no
longer
was
going
to
make
the
facility
move
the
patient
out
because
of
a
review
committee
determination.
however,
the
facilities
were
left
free
to
move
patients
if
they
thought
they
were
not
properly
placed.
and
indeed,
state
law
requires
facilities
on
their
own,
wholly
apart
from
the
review
committee
functions,
to
move
out
patients
not
properly
there.
that
is
the
distinction.
the
state
for
its
own
part...
the
state
said
we
tie
our
hands;
we
are
not
going
to
be
responsible
anymore
for
making
facilities
move
patients
because
there
has
been
an
adverse
review
committee
determination.
the
state
thought
that
too
harmful,
too
traumatic.
the
parties
both
recognized...
and
that
is
why
the
state
has
fought
this
issue...
that
the
facilities
themselves
not
only
were
free
but
should
be
free
to
move
patients
on
their
own.
and
respondents
contend
that
the
state
law
is
clear
that
they
have
to.
indeed,
that
is
the
only
way
that
the
facilities
now
could
discharge
their
obligation
under
law
to
move
any
inappropriately
placed
patients.
indeed,
it
is
precisely--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--what
prohibits
them
now,
your
honor,
is
the
deterrent
effect
of
a
hearing
at
which
these
plaintiffs
would
test
the
validity
of--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--what
the
district
court
required
after
finding
that
there
was
state
action
and
due
process
protection
was
that
the
state
had
to
provide
a
hearing
forum
in
which
the
plaintiffs,
the
named
plaintiffs--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--to
decide
whether
the
decision
upon
which
the
facility
based
its
transfer
was,
under
federal
and
state
law,
correct.
federal
an
state
law
says
a
facility
cannot
move
a
patient
unless
it
is
for
good
medical
reasons--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
the
traditional
barrier
that
is
imposed
by
the
law
in
the
context
of
a
review
committee
determination.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
federal
law
requires
it
there,
for
example,
if
doctors--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--the
regulations...
the
federal
regulations
that
ms.
gordon
discussed
that
state
when
a
review
committee
determines
a
patient
should
be
moved
and
that
there
is
a
medicaid
adjustment
at
issue,
the
state
has
to
provide
a
so-called
fair
hearing.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
well,
we
maintain
that
it
does,
of
course.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
we
say
both.
i
was
trying
to
respond
justice
marshall's--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--well,
we
are
trying
to
do
that
because
this
case
is
unique.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
yes,
we
did.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
they
did
not
reach
that
issue.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
is
true,
they
did
not
write
about
it.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
i
guess
that
is
true.
we--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--impliedly,
as
justice
rehnquist
characterized
it--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
yes.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
not
officially
before
the
court,
no.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
there
is
nothing
officially
in
the
record
about
ahs's
position,
but--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
i
am
not
here
making
the
argument
that
federal
and
state
fair
hearing
regulations
apply
to
transfers
up.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
is
right.
and
as
well,
we
are
saying
that
these
fair
hearing
regulations
apply
to
transfer
to
a
lower
level
of
care
or
out
of
a
facility
into
an
adult
home
or
the
community,
because
there
is
a
reduction--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--we
do
not
disagree
about
that
at
all.
we
both
understand
that
discharges
because
of
utilization
review
committee
determinations
are
forbidden.
we
are
in
full
agreement
that
the
consent
judgment
does
not
apply
to
facility
initiated
transfers
or
discharges.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
argued
with
respect
to
transfers
to
a
higher
level
of
care
and
to
a
lower
level
of
care.
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
prior
hearings
with
respect--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--we
do
not
retreat
from
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale,
but
we
believe
that
there
is
a
simpler
method
of
disposing
of
the
state
action
question
which
is
that--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--requires
it,
orders
it,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
well,
no.
i
would
say
that
when
the
state
provides
a
forum
for
deciding
whether
there
is
state...
there
is
a
violation,
that
the
mere
provision
of
a
judicial
forum
by
itself--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--well,
the
question,
your
honor,
in
this
context
is
that
again,
if
the
federal
and
state
regulations
themselves
say
that
a
facility
cannot
move
a
person
unless
for
valid
medical
reasons--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--here
it
is
a
question
of...
your
honor,
we
think
that,
for
example,
in
the
moose
lodge
case
where
this
court
had
not
trouble
saying
that
if
the
state
liquor
control
board
has
a
regulation
that
says
we
are
going
to
enforce
a
bylaw
of
a
private
club,
even
though
it
is
neutral
in
its
terms,
that
is
state
action.
we
submit
that
this
is
no
different
where
the
state
says
that
regulation
that
says
we
are
going
to
enforce
or
direct
a
nursing
home
to
kick
out
a
patient
if
the
patient
is
not
thought
to
be
appropriately
there,
we
think
that
is
a
state
action
as
well.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
we
maintain
that
we
do,
that
it
is
required
because
there
are
due
process
protected
interests
there
as
well
because
the
reg
is
again
saying
even
if--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--no,
we
would
not
because
there
is
no
property
interest
under
law
that
protects
someone
against
getting
more
benefits.
here
the
regulations
say
you
cannot
transfer
a
patient
up
or
down
or
out
unless
for
good
cause.
and
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
your
honor,
the
federal
and
state
regulations
state
that
a
nursing
facility
may
not
transfer
or
discharge...
that
is
the
language--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--the
property
interest
is
the
interest
which
is
embedded
in
positive
state
and
federal
law
that
says
that
you
should
be
free
of
having
to
move
to
a
higher
level
of
care
unless
there
is
good
reason
to
do
it.
and
the
reason
why
that
is
done
is
not
surprising
because
as
indicated
in
a
deposition
in
this
case,
when
people
are
asked
to
go
to
a
higher
level
of
care,
they
think
they
are
dying.
and
the
trauma
which--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--not
to
that
precise
effect.
what
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
the
whole
underpinning
of
the
consent
judgment...
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
defendants
made
it
very
clear,
affidavit
statements
and
the
commissioner's
letters
to
the
federal
government,
that
the
reason
why
it
refused
to
enforce
review
committee
determinations
was
because
the
move
itself
is
so
devastating
and
so
harmful
to
patients
that
it
should
not
be
done.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
there
is,
of
course,
trauma
involved,
but
we
do
not
maintain
that
a
finding
of
transfer
trauma
is
necessary
for
the...
on
the
narrow
issues
that,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
are
before
the
court,
which
is
whether
there
is
state
action,
and
on
the
standing
issue
as
well,
that
this
court
did
not
take
the
questions
of
whether
there
are
protected
property
or
liberty
interests
involved.
we
do
not
think
that
they
are
critical.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
because
that
is
not
the
only
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
that
would
be
part
of
the
issue.
the
other
part,
again,
in
the
regulations
which
talks
about
that
a
transfer
cannot
be
accomplished
unless
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
patient
or
his
welfare,
is
that
if
that
patient
could
show
that
he
or
she
had
lived
in
a
nursing
home
for
20
years
and
they
propose
to
send
that
patient
out
of
new
york
city
to
upstate
new
york
on
some
erroneous
medical
judgment--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--there
are--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--of
the
transfers
to
a
higher
level
of
care?
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
the
evidence
that
we
have
here
as
part
of
the
joint
pretrial
order
is
that
during
the
period
in
which
this
case
was
in
litigation,
and
when
the
state
did
provide
hearings...
at
one
point
it
did...
there
were,
the
defendants
state,
at
least
10
cases
of
transfers
to
a
higher
level
of
care;
five
were
reversed
at
hearing.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
those
litigants,
those
persons,
were
members
of
the
class;
none
of
them
are
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
your
honor,
i
want
to
briefly
point
out
some
significant
aspects
of
the
joint
pretrial
order
in
this
case.
in
that
case,
in
that
joint
pretrial
order,
there
were
the
allegations
made
that
a
substantial
proportion
of
facility
transfers
of
medicaid
patients
are
improper
under
federal
and
state
law.
defendants
did
not
controvert
that
particular
allegation.
that
is,
at
the
stage
of
the
case
where
in
affidavit
form
and
in
statement
under
local
court
rules
the
defendants
identified
what
allegations
of
the
plaintiffs
they
disagreed
with,
they
did
not
controvert
that.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
significant
here
when
the
class
was
defined
without
objection,
without
appeal
by
the
defendants
to
include
all
medicaid
patients
in
nursing
facilities
in
new
york
state,
and
given
this
allegation
that
class
members
were
transferred
improperly,
not
controverted
by
the
defendants,
standing
was
never
interposed
as
a
basis
for
objection
below,
that
that
class
certification
can
bridge
the
gap
between
the
allegations
of
the
named
plaintiffs
and
the
allegations,
unrefuted,
unobjected
to
by
the
defendants
concerning
class
members,
when
there
was
no
objection
taken
to
the
certification
of
the
class,
no
appeal
taken
in
the
statement
of
controverted
issues
that
the
proposition,
that
allegation
about
class
members
was
not
contested.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
listed
among
the
parties
before
this
court.
yes.
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
the
petition
itself,--
mr.
john
e.
kirklin
--they
are
definitely
listed
among
the
parties.
