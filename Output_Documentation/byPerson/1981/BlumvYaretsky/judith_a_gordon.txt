ms.
judith
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york's
alleged
involvement
in
medical
decisions
about
nursing
home
care
for
medicaid
patients
was
found
below
to
constitute
state
action
in
two
kinds
of
circumstances.
a
brief
review
of
the
kinds
of
circumstances
in
which
state
action
was
found
to
be
present
is
necessary
because
that
inquiry
determines
the
additional
question
petitioners
raise
in
this
case;
that
is,
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
to
decide
the
claims
that
are
now
before
you,
and
also,
it
aids
the
inquiry,
the
state
action
inquiry,
in
the
event
the
court
reaches
that
inquiry.
the
first
circumstance
in
which
state
action
was
found
to
be
present
occurs
when
a
patient's
outside
physician,
or
a
physician
on
the
staff
of
a
nursing
home,
decides
to
decrease
or
increase
the
level
of
the
patient's
care
because
his
condition
has
become
worse
or
because
it
has
become
better.
in
our
brief,
we
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
nursing
home
staff
physician
as
a
nursing
home
decision
or
transfer,
and
we
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
outside
physician
as
the
decision
of
a
private
physician,
albeit
both
of
those
decisions
are
private
action
within
the
constraints
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
below.
the
second
circumstance
in
which
state
action
was
found
to
be
present
occurs
when
a
utilization
review
committee
or
a
physician
member
of
that
committee
decides
to
increase
a
patient's
level
of
care
because
his
condition
has
become
worse.
parenthetically,
it
should
be
noted
that
utilization
review
is
a
federally-required
peer
review
system,
that
a
utilization
review
decision
about
a
change
in
care
for
a
patient
who
is
already
in
a
nursing
home
is
made
during
a
portion
of
that
process
called
continued
stay
review,
and
the
continued
stay
review
is
addressed
to
whether
or
not
the
patient
needs
nursing
home
care
at
all,
and
if
he
does,
what
kind
of
care
he
needs.
two
further
points
with
respect
to
utilization
review,
and
that
is
the
utilization
review
physician's
decision
to
change
a
level
of
care
is
final
once
made
if
it
is
not
opposed
by
the
patient's
own
physician,
and
that
requirement
is
specific
to
the
federal
regulations
which
are
found
at
42
cfr
556.336,
and
442
cfr
556.
436,
and
the
state
regulations
track
the
federal
regulations
in
that
regard.
in
addition,
if
the
utilization
review
physician
decides
that
the
patient
needs
this
upward
change
in
level
of
care
and
his
decision
is
opposed
by
the
patient's
private
physician,
if
two
utilization
review
physicians
agree,
then
the
decision
of
the
utilization
review
committee
becomes
final,
again,
under
the
regulations
that
i
just
called
to
your
attention.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
42
cfr
456.330
following
which
describes
these
various
utilization
review
procedures
in
quite
tedious
detail,
i
think
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
time.
however,
i
can't,
in
fact,
give
you
an
exact
estimate,
but
certainly
we
have
no
indication
that
the
physicians
who
serve
on
these
committees
are
not
attending
to
the
care
of
their
patients,
at
least
in
this
record.
petitioners
contend
that
the
district
court
should
never
have
reached
the
transfers
that
are
at
issue
and
that
i
just
described
with
respect...
in
the
circumstances
i
just
described.
and
that
is
because
there
was
no
plaintiff
and
no
class
representative
before
the
district
court
who
could
have
raised
the
issues.
not
only
was
there
no
one
who
had
such
a
transfer
or
was
threatened
with
such
a
transfer,
there
certainly
was
no
one
who
had
the
reality
or
the
prospect
of
the
kind
of
distinct
and
palpable
injury
that
article
iii
requires.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
with
respect--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--exactly.
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
the
name
respondents
and
the
named
intervenors,
and
that
case
or
controversy
rested
on
their
claims
that
you
urc's
had
improperly
transferred
them
to
lower
levels
of
care.
not
urc's--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--that
dispute
was
the
initial
predicate
in
this
case,
it
was
initially
decided
by
a
preliminary
injunction
back
in
january
of
1978,
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
it
was
ultimately
resolved
as
you
indicate
on
october
17,
1979
by
the
first
partial
final
judgment
in
this
case,
which
was
entered--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--yes,
it
was
resolved
in
the
district
court.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
exactly
my
question,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
pardon
me?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
your
honor,
the
assistants
then--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
assistants
handling
the
case
at
that
point
did
indeed
go
ahead
and
litigate
these
other
issues
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
this
court
on
the
petition
here
today.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
issues,
the
merits
of
the
issues
were
indeed
litigated
without
objection
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
would
add
one
point
to
that,
your
honor.
when
it
came
time
to
consider
the
preparation
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
mrs.
siegel
was
then
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
new
york...
she
is
no
longer...
and
we,
myself
and
the
assistants
who
aided
me,
reviewed
the
record
in
this
case
which
was
quite
lengthy,
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
article
iii
question
was
fairly
presented
by
the
record.
we
also
observed
that
it
had
not
been
raised
before
and
we
had
detailed
conversations
with
mrs.
siegel
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
call
it
to
your
attention.
the
conclusion
of
those
conversations
was
that
we
could
not,
consistent
with
the
standards
of
our
practice,
fail
to
call
them
to
your
attention,
lest
this
court
reach
the
merits
of
the
case
involving
constitutional
rulings,
which
was
not
adequately
presented
in
terms
of
article
iii.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
a
very
interesting
point,
your
honor.
at
page
14
of
our
main
brief
we
describe
briefly
what
the
state
policies
were
before
the
judgment
on
review
came
up.
one
of
the
state
policies
with
respect
to
urc
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care,
which
you
just
called
to
my
attention,
was
that
those
transfers
would
be,
in
effect,
advisory.
in
other
words,
the
state
of
new
york,
the
medicaid
authorities,
would
not
change
the
level
of
benefits
based
on
a
urc
decision,
it
would
simply
await
what
the
doctor
did,
what
the
urc
did.
if
the
patiently
ultimately
got
transferred
by
virtue
of
that
urc
decision,
then
it
would
adjust
the
benefits.
if
it
did
not,
if
the
patient
did
not
get
transferred,
they
would
leave
the
benefits
intact.
now,
aside
from
substantial
equity
problems
that
were
involved
in
that
policy
which
was,
of
course,
superseded
by
this
judgment;
namely,
there
were
people
in
nursing
homes
who
in
fact
needed
a
much
more
intensive
level
of
care
and
were
not
receiving
it,
that
being
one
of
the
equities
on
a
change
of
policy
side.
the
federal
government
came
along
and
advised
us
that
although
they
had
required
hearings
on
urc
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care,
that
our
ffp,
our
federal
financial
participation,
was
in
serious
jeopardy
if
we
avoided
hearings
on
higher
levels
of
care.
and
the
letters
with
respect
to
that
appear
in
the
second
supplement
to
the
joint
appendix,
which
includes
some
letters
referred
to
in
petitioner's
brief...
pardon
me,
respondents'
brief...
at
page
4,
note
4.
in
other
words,
respondents
refer
to
a
letter
by
commissioner
blum
to
the
federal
authorities
saying
can't
we
please
give
hearings
on
urc
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care
now,
since
you
already
told
us
there
is
a
program
requirement...
not
as
a
constitutional
requirement...
that
we
have
to
give
them
on
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care.
that
is
the
first
letter
in
the
second
supplement
to
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
right.
the
answer
from
the
federal
government
was
that
they
did
not
perceive
that
to
be
an
effective
way
of
utilization
review,
at
least
for
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
it
can
be
or
it
cannot
be
depending
on
how...
what
the
facts
are.
and
as
i
indicated,
we
do
not
have
any
plaintiffs
who
present
the
facts
that
would
support
those
kinds
of
conclusions.
however,
when
we
viewed
this
judgment,
we
thought
of
it
as
pertaining
really
only
to
medical
decisions;
decisions
by
a
nursing
home's
medical
director
and
therefore
medically
predicated.
there
is
a
possible
other
reading
which
plaintiff...
which
respondents
point
out
essentially
at
page
22
of
their
brief
and
throughout
their
brief,
that
a
nursing
home,
not
through
its
medical
director
but
through
its
administrator,
might
want
to
discharge
somebody
because
he
is
a
bad
patient,
or
for
some
other
non-medical
reason.
now,
those
discharges,
in
fact,
present
this
case
in
microcosm,
because
those
kinds
of
discharges
are
covered
by
something
called
the
patient's
bill
of
rights,
which
is
codified
in
federal
regulations
and
codified
in
state
regulations.
and
what
that
bill
of
rights
says
is,
if
you
were
transferred
by
your
nursing
home,...
presumably
a
human
being
who
has
made
a
decision
who
is
affiliated
with
the
nursing
home.
if
you
were
transferred
for
non-medical
reasons,
for
non-payment,
for
your
own
welfare,
you
have
a
right
to
challenge
that
nursing
home
decision.
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
bring
a
medicaid
reimbursement
claim
against
the
state
in
a
fair
hearing
to
get
money;
that
does
not
do
you
any
good.
you
have
a
right
to
bring
a
private
action
against
the
nursing
home.
and
we
suggest
to
you
that
the
kinds
of
medical
decisions
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
made
as
they
are
by
these
private
urc's,
the
facility
medical
director,
the
staff
physician,
your
outside
physician,
present
exactly
the
same
kind
of
private
transactions
as
the
purely...
as
respondents
call
them...
the
purely
non-medical
needs
decisions,
and
that
the
remedy
for
these,
if
there
is
to
be
a
remedy,
is
against
the
people
who
made
the
decisions.
not
in
a
request
to
the
state
to
pay
you
money
for
a
service
that
an
individual
in
the
private
sector
has
already
refused
to
provide
you.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
state
prescribes
the
use
of
what
respondents
have
called
and
what
are,
in
fact,
a
dms-1
form
and
a
dms-9
form.
those
forms
can
be
found...
they
are
not
referenced
in
respondents'
briefs,
but
they
can
be
found
in
appendix
c1
to
volume
c
of
title
x
of
the
new
york
code
rules
and
regulations.
their
are
displayed
there
in
full.
now,
the
state
has
prescribed
those
forms,
and
what
those
forms
consist
of
are,
one,
a
standard
sheet
which
assigns...
in
fact,
the
sheet
is
called
new
york
state
numerical
standards
master
sheet.
that
is
the
dms-9
form.
and
the
dms-1
form
is
called
the
new
york
state
long-term
care
placement
form.
and
what
those
forms
do
is
describe
certain
kinds
of
medical
conditions,
certain
kinds
of
patient
conditions...
in
other
words,
self-care
in
dressing,
needs
help,
needs
total
help...
and
certain
other
kinds
of
conditions
such
as
needs
restraints,
requires...
is
assaultive.
and
the
numerical
standards
assign
certain
weights
to
these
depending
on
when
the
condition
occurs.
now,
those
two
forms
used
in
combination...
and
they
are
used
throughout
this
proceed
including
with
respect
to
these
medical
decision...
create
what
are
called
predictor
scores.
if
you
get
a
score
of
60,
you
are
arguably
appropriate
for
an
intermediate
care
facility;
if
you
get
a
score
of
180
you
are
arguably
appropriate
for
an
snf
or
skilled
nursing
facility.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
now,
respondents
say
that
those
forms
determine
the
choice.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
the
doctor
has
to
use
this
form
means
that
the
state
has
made
up
his
mind
for
him.
the
answer
to
that
is
absolutely
no.
the
specific
regulations
which
control
the
use
of
these
forms;
namely,
10
new
york
code
rules
and
regulations,
section
415.1a(2)
and
section
420.1b,
state
in
terms
that
all
the
physician
who
gets
this
form
has
to
do
to
say
that
his
patient
needs
another
kind
of
care
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
predictor
score,
is
say
so.
in
other
words,
the
physician
has
an
override;
the
form
does
not
foreclose
the
patient's
access
to
the
kind
of
care
that
the
doctor
wants
to
see
him
have.
and
it
does
not
determine
what
the
doctor
is
supposed
to
do.
one
other
fact--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--very
well,
your
honor.
i
would--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--i
would
just
like
to
point
out
one
other
factor
with
respect
to
the
dms-1
forms
because
in
the
entire
array
of
federal
and
state
laws
which
the
respondents
bring
to
bear
on
their
argument...
which
is
not
the
court
of
appeals'
argument...
that
state
action
is
somehow
found
in
these
transfers
because
the
state
forces
them,
the
only
point
that
needs
clarification
is,
in
fact,
the
use
of
these
dms-1
forms.
justice
o'connor,
if
i
just
might
finish,
the
respondents
also
say
that
somehow,
even
if
we
use
these
forms
and
they
are
not
specifically
controlled
by
the
state,
their
results
are
not
specifically
controlled
by
the
state,
that
we
at
some
point
review
them,
and
we
determine
whether
they
are
correctly
drawn
or
incorrectly
drawn,
and
disapprove
or
approve
the
physician
choices
that
appear
on
those
forms.
that
is
an
absolutely
incorrect
statement.
the
portion
of
the
record
that
the
respondents
cite
for
that
point
is
an
affidavit
by
donald
davidoff,
which
is
document
18
of
the
record
on
appeal,
and
the
affidavit
simply
does
not
say
that,
and
that
is
not
in
fact
what
we
do.
we
leave
the
forms
as
we
find
them.
we
do
collect
them,
we
use
them
for
statistical
purposes,
and
it
is
possible
that
in
the
course
of
receiving
those
forms
or
in
the
course
of
another
procedure
that
the
respondents
called
to
your
attention
which
are
called
periodic
medical
reviews
and
independent
professional
reviews
which
are
audits
essentially
of
the
quality
of
care
offered
in
nursing
homes,
it
is
possible
that
in
the
course
of
any
of
this
regulatory
complex
that
the
state
might,
indeed,
find
a
nursing
home
patient
who
is
inappropriately
placed.
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case,
certainly
not
on
these
facts.
but
if
the
state
were
to
find
that
patient
and
it
were
to
direct
that
patient's
removal
from
a
nursing
home,
well
then,
certainly,
we
would
not
be
here
today
arguing
this
case.
that
would
be
a
state
initiated
transfer,
and
new
york
at
least
would
not
come
before
this
court
and
claim
that
state
action
was
not
present.
but
the
kinds
of
transfers
that
were
decided
below
are
all
medically
initiated
for
reasons
determined
by
private
parties,
and
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
state's
control,
intervention
or
forcing
of
any
of
the
decisions
at
issue.
returning
just
briefly
to
the
standing
point,
your
honor,
respondents
make
essentially
two
arguments
against
the
petition...
the
petitioner's
claim
that
they
lack
standing.
the
first
is...
depends
on
their
acknowledge
that
indeed,
in
january
of
1978,
the
district
court
did
enjoin
the
urc
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care.
but
they
turn
around
and
they
say
that
notwithstanding
that
injunction,
the
same
individuals...
presumably
the
respondents
and
the
intervenors...
were
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
risk,
albeit
the
injunction
was
enforced,
because
the
nursing
home
was
going
to
adopt
that
urc
decision
as
its
own.
it
was
going
to
simply
say
oh,
well,
urc,
you
are
enjoined;
now
we
are
going
to
enforce
that...
we
are
going
to
make
the
same
choice
and
disregard
the
order.
well,
the
argument
omits
to
point
out
that
in
the
very
order
that
enjoined
the
urc's...
to
wit:
the
january
5,
1978
injunction...
the
nursing
homes
themselves
were
also
enjoined.
and
therefore,
the
argument
assumes
that
the
nursing
homes
would
have
entered
into
some
kind
of
subterfuge
or
circumvention
of
the
order
to
make
the
same
choice
and
say
it
was
their
own
and
not
a
urc
order.
the
record
is
completely
barren
of
any
evidence
which
even
suggests
that
the
nursing
home
sought
to
circumvent
the
order
in
this
regard,
and
indeed,
it
is
barren
of
any
evidence
that
the
nursing
home
ever
threatened
or
transferred
any
of
the
named
respondents
in
any
way
whatsoever
once
the
order
was
issued.
moreover,
even
if
you
accept
the
logic
of
the
argument,
it
still
fails
because
the
injunction
upon
which
it
relies;
namely,
urc
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care,
is
not
at
all
coextensive
with
the
claims
that
the
respondents
sought
to
put
before
the
court;
namely,
including
those
claims
to
higher
levels
of
care
and
to...
and
physician
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care.
a
second
argument
that
respondents
make
with
respect
to
our
claim
that
they
lack
standing
relies
on
the
speculation
that
there
must
be
some
other
member
of
this
class,
even
if
it
is
not
the
named
respondents
and
intervenors,
who
in
fact
had
a
physician
transfer
to
a
higher
level
of
care,
or
a
urc
transfer
to
a
higher
level
of
care.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
argument
is
impossible
because
the
laws
established
that
the
claims
of
class
members
can
never
be
broader
than
the
claims
of
class
representatives,
and
the
only
class
representatives
before
the
court
below
were
indeed
the
named
respondents
and
the
intervenors
who
only
had
the
urc
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care.
respondents
also
called
to
your
attention
two
letters...
actually,
three
letters;
two
are
identical
and
one
is
slightly
different...
in
support
of
their
claim
that
some
member
of
the
class
had
these
transfers.
the
letters
are
dated
a
year
and
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
district
court
entered
the
last
partial
final
judgment
in
this
case,
and
they
are
appended
to
their
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
and
obviously,
a
transfer,
even
assuming
the
person
who
was
receiving
it
was
aggrieved,
and
these
letters
do
not
suggest
that
they
were,
a
transfer
happening
to
somebody
a
year
or
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
district
court
determined
the
claims
that
are
at
issue,
cannot
serve
to
place
those
claims
before
the
district
court.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
two
of
the
letters,
your
honor,
dated
december
18th,
1980,
are
to
nursing
homes
and
do
identify
two
individuals.
as
your
honor
reviews
those
letters
i
think
you
will
find,
as
i
have
found,
that
what
they
describe
are
the
enforcement
procedures
under
the
partial
final
judgment
that
is
in
issue
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
they
were
telling
the
nursing
home
liaison
how
to
comply.
and
the
patient
is
identified
in
that
context.
it
is
not
suggested
for
a
moment
that
any
of
the
identified
patients...
or
either
of
the
identified
patients...
thought
that
they
should
have
a
hearing
right
on
any
of
the
transfers
that
are
in
issue,
or
even
that
they
had
any
opinion
at
all.
in
other
words,
they
do
not
show
that
these
individuals
were
aggrieved
by
the...
on
the
same
basis
as
aggrieved
by
the
claims
that
were
adjudicated
below.
as
i
indicated
before
on
the
state
action
point,
or
as
i
perhaps
should
have
indicated
before,
we
think
the
stay
action
analysis
is
controlled
by
jackson
versus
metropolitan
edison
co.
we
think
that
the
close
nexus
between
state
and
private
action
that
that
decision
requires
must
be
shown
with
respect
to
the
state's
imprimatur
or
weight
or
affirmative
conduct
with
respect
to
one
of
the
kinds
of
choices--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--no,
your
honor.
the
issue
never
arose
because
in
1976,
while
a
district
case
was
in
progress
before
the
southern
district,
the
federal
government
advised
us
that
hearings
had
to
he
held
on
urc
transfers
to
lower
levels
of
care.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
medicaid
program
requirement--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--exactly.
right.
and
indeed,
when
they
so
advised
us...
and
their
exchange
of
letters
on
this
point
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
6
in
the
footnote
there...
they
characterized
our
antagonism,
if
you
will,
to
providing
hearings
in
that
context
as
not
the
most
reasoned
approach
to
fair
hearings...
to
utilization
review
decisions.
but
they
did,
indeed,
impose
that
requirement.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
those
are
the
same
regulations
which
the
federal
government
told
us
to
apply
in
the
downward
urc
transfers.
which,
as
i
just
noted
to
you,
characterizing
themselves
as
not
the
most
reasoned
application
of
the
regulations.
and
the
reason
that
it
is
not
the
most
reasoned
application
is
what
makes...
is
what
makes
those
regulations
inapplicable
here
and,
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
will
close
with
that.
the
regulations
require
fair
hearings
for
agency
action
reducing
or
terminating
assistance
or
denying
a
service,
essentially.
and
they
are
much
like
the
fair
hearing
regulations
in
goldberg
vs.
kelly
or
available
in
other
assistance
programs.
the
decision
to
transfer
a
patient,
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
case,
is
not
an
agency
decision,
and
so
much
is
revealed
by
the
exhibit
letter
from
the
federal
government
which
is
attached
to
our
brief,
wherein
the
letter
acknowledges
that
if
a
physician
made
this
choice,
not
the
urc,
then
there
would
be
no
fair
hearing
requirement
obligations.
in
other
words--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--as
the
federal
government
used
the
regulations,
a
transfer
to
a
higher
level
of
care
normally
results
in
an
increase
in
assistance,
all
right,
not
a
reduction
or
termination
of
assistance.
so
in
that
sense,
it
is
inapposite,
although
there
are
some
exceptions
in
new
york
because
we
have
a
varying
rate
system.
but
certainly,
our
rate
system
is
not
coextensive
with
all
transfers,
so
it
out
on
that
basis.
second,
it
is
not
agency
action,
and
it
is
out
on
that
basis.
no
matter
how
one
characterizes
it,
albeit
the
federal
government
did
and
would
withhold
our
ffp
if
we
disagreed
with
them
on
urc
down-transfers,
under
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
urc
is
a
private
body,
not
the
state
agency,
and
therefore,
it
could
not
make
a
relevant
decision.
but
perhaps
more
importantly,
if
we
want
to
put
aside
all
the
technical
deficiencies
in
the
terms
of
the
regulations,
i
think
we
come
back
to
what
i
indicated
to
justice
o'connor
before,
and
that
is
that
the
fair
hearing
does
not
address
the
issues.
the
dispute
here
is
between
the
urc
and
the
patient,
the
physician
and
the
patient.
if
i
take
a
fair
hearing
and
the
state
therefore
then
says
to
me,
well,
all
right,
we
will
continue
to
reimburse
mrs.
x's
snf
care.
that
does
not
mean
that
her
doctor
is
going
to
give
her
that
care.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
facility
medical
director
is
going
to
give
her
that
care.
that
decision
to
provide
the
facility
with
money
does
not
change
the
doctor's
mind.
thank
you.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor,
i
have
just
a
few
points.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
not
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--they
are
listed
as
parties,
they
were
apparently
parties
in
the
first
half
of
this
case
which
ended
with
the
consent
judgment
back
in
1979,
the
october
one.
but
if
your
honor
turns
to
the
pretrial
order
which
starts
at,
i
believe,
page
250
of
the
appendix...
pardon
me,
150
of
the
appendix,...
you
will
find
that
in
the
description
of
the
nature
of
the
action
in
proceedings
and
in
the
nature
of
the
parties,
which
is
on
page
151--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--i
am
sorry.
that
in
the
description
of
the
nature
of
the
action
in
proceedings
at
page
150
and
following
at
page
151,
the
nature
of
the
parties,
the
grey
panthers
are
not
described,
and
we
have
considered,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
that
their
claims
were
abandoned.
if
they
were
not
abandoned,
we
also
believe
that
their
standing
was
not
made
out.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor,
i
could
not
hear
you.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
justice
o'connor,
just
a
point
of
clarification,
it
is
not
only
urc
transfers
to
higher
levels
of
care
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case;
it
is
also
the
medical
decisions
of
the
outside
physician
and
the
nursing
home
physician
that
are
in
issue.
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
in
the
record
which
spoke
to
the
federal...
whether
or
not
hhs
was
requiring
hearings
in
the
circumstances
before
the
court,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
exhibit
that
concludes
our
brief,
wherein
hhs,
then
hew,
states
at
page
2(a),
"a
change
in
medical
care
ordered
by
a
patient's
physician
does
not
represent
an
agency
proposal
to
terminate,
suspend
or
reduce
assistance
payment.
"
"if
a
patient
disagrees
with
his
physician's
determination
of
medical
necessity
for
a
specific
service,
his
recourse
is
to
the
practitioner
or
his
professional
association,
not
to
the
medical
assistance
agency.
"
and
again,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
second
supplement
to
the
joint
appendix,
where
in
the
letters
that
follow,
commissioner
blum's
letter,
show
that
the
federal
government
not
only
did
not
consider
urc
transfers
upward
subject
to
fair
hearing
rights,
but
they
threatened
to
withdraw
ffp
if
we
provided
fair
hearing
rights
with
respect
to
them.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
it
is
not--
ms.
judith

gordon
--yes.
it
was
not
that
they
are
not
technical
parties.
they
were
listed
in
the
caption,
your
honor.
it
is
just
that
they,
one,
had
no
standing
in
the
original
case,
and
to
the
extent
that
one
has
to
rely
on
the
post-consent
judgment
claims
which
are
now
before
you,
the
grey
panthers--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--yes,
they
are

ms.

--that
is
correct,
your

ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
parties
here
in
terms
of
their
technical
inclusion
in

however,
they
made
no
sufficient
claims
at
the
outset--
ms.

gordon
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
do
not
have
an
objection
to
their
appearing
in
the
caption.
i
have
an
objection
to
finding
by
reason
thereof
or
any
other
predicate
that
they
had
standing
in
the
first
instance
in
this
case,
or
that
they
had
any
claim
specifically--
ms.

i
indicated
earlier,--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--that
is
correct,
your

ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct,
your

ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
for
the
fact
that
it
is
a
jurisdictional
objection
and
cannot
be
waived,
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
would
not
have
been
presented
to
this
court
were
it
not
for
serious
conversations
on
that
point
with
the
solicitor
general.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
portion
of
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
utilization
review,
which
i
think
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
utilization--

--thank
you,
your
honor.
