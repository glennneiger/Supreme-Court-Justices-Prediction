mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
much
of
the
debate
in
this
case
involves
what
mr.
gressman
referred
to
as
a
tug
of
war
between
the
executive
branch
and
the
congress.
while
those
concerns
are
important,
there
are
other
interests
at
stake
as
well,
and
it
is
important
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
legislative
vetoes
in
general,
and
this
one
in
particular,
affect
the
lives
of
many
people
subject
to
the
laws
of
this
country.
i
want
to
begin
by
answering
the
question
posed
about
the
effect
of
mr.
chadha's
marriage
and
the
refugee
act,
something
that
was
called
an
academic
matter
by
counsel
for
the
congress.
if
mr.
chadha's
decision
here
is
affirmed,
he
will
be
a
citizen
by
the
4th
of
july.
he
has
filed
a
naturalization
petition
which
has
been
accepted
by
the
naturalization
service
in
san
francisco.
he
is
only
awaiting
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
before
he
will
become
a
citizen.
that
means
that
he
will
be
able
to
vote,
he
will
have
other
rights
that
aliens
do
not
have,
and
he
will
have
it
almost
immediately.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
has
to
go
the
other
route,
he
will
be
told
that
his
wife
will
then
have
to
file
a
petition
to
adjust
his
status.
that
will
take
about
a
year
or
so
to
be
acted
upon
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
thereafter,
he
will
then
have
to
wait
three
additional
years
before
he
becomes
a
citizen.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
if
you
don't
determine
the
merits
of
this
case,
that
is,
if
the
decision
below
is
affirmed,
mr.
chadha
will
be
a
citizen
immediately.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
he
will
then
have
to
go
through
this
other
process.
he
will
then
have
to...
his
wife
will
then
have
to
file
an
application
in
his
behalf
to
adjust
his
status.
when
that
application
is--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--i
would
assume
you
would
set
it
aside,
and
vacate
the
judgment
on
grounds
not
of
mootness,
because
the
senate
and
house
do
not
contend
it
is
moot,
but
on
the
grounds
of
prudential
consideration.
he
will
be
told
that
this
case,
which
was
filed
in
1977,
arising
out
of
a
determination
by
the
immigration
service
in
1974,
and
a
veto
in
december
of
1975,
all
this
was
to
nought,
because
while
the
case
was
awaiting
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
he
and
his
wife
were
married.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
assume
that
is
what
would
happen,
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
don't
know
there
is
much
to
remand.
my
client
readily
concedes,
indeed,
if
he
loses
this
case
on
any
other
grounds,
would
have
to
embrace
the
notion
that
he
could
be...
remain
in
this
country
on
the
grounds
of
the
marriage
and
the
refugee
act.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
he
did
not.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
he
did
not.
we
believe
that--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes,
he
could
have.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
he
would
not
be
a
citizen
by
now,
because
he...
the
marriage
took
place
in
august
of
1980.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
so
this
was
several
months
before
the
decision,
and
we
were
concerned--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--four
years...
we
estimate...
and
three
years
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
other
time
is
a
matter
of
some
flexibility,
but
it
is
about
a
year,
and
he
was
advised
at
that
time
that
he
could
be
a
citizen
sooner,
and
since
he
very
much
wants
to
be
a
citizen,
he
insisted
upon
pressing
this
case.
he
also
feels
quite
strongly
about
this
case
and
the
way
he
has
been...
his
case
has
been
handled,
and
feels
that
the
separation
of
powers
is
an
interesting
concept
as
far
as
the
senate
and
the
house
and
the
president
are
concerned,
but
it
also
affects
people.
it
has
affected
his
life
very
greatly
during
this
time.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
they
appeared
as
amicus--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
is
correct.
he
filed
his
petition
for
review,
and
the
service
took
the
position
that
it
had
no
choice
but
to
deport
mr.
chadha
unless
a
court
agreed
with
the
service
that
the
provision
is
unconstitutional.
at
this
point,
the
service
contacted
the
senate
and
house
and
asked
them
to
file
amicus
briefs,
and
then
after
judgment
they
intervened.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
i
understand
the
answer
to
that.
what
happened
was
that
during
the
course
of
oral
argument,
the
court
raised
a
question
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is,
whether
we
were
in
the
right
court.
that
matter
had
been
alluded
to
in
the
house...
in
the
congress's
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
had
not
been
briefed
extensively.
the
court
asked
us
to
file
briefs,
and
shortly
after
briefs
were
filed,
we
received
an
order
saying...
shortly
after
the
briefs
were
ordered
to
be
filed,
we
received
an
order
from
the
court
saying,
the
matter
is
withdrawn
from
submission.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
an
internal
operating
procedure
of
the
ninth
circuit,
but
that
is
the
order
we
received.
incidentally,
one
of
the
judges
passed
away
while
the
case
was--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
and
that
is
the...
the
withholding
order
was
issued
at
the
same
time
as
the
order
to
submit
supplemental
briefs.
both
sides,
that
is,
the
senate
and
house,
saying
we
were
in
the
wrong
court,
and
the
justice
department
and
i
saying
we
were
in
the
right
court,
submitted
those
supplemental
briefs,
and
either
through
a
clerical
error
or
some
other
reason,
the
matter
was
not
ordered
to
be
resubmitted
and
reinstated
on
the
calendar.
that's
the
only...
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record
on
that,
justice
blackmun,
but
those
are
the
sequences
of
events
from
which
i
presume
that
it
had...
the
withdrawal
from
the
calendar
had
to
do
with
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
was
not
reargued.
in
this
case,
mr.
chadha
succeeded
in
persuading
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
deportation
would
result
in
extreme
hardship,
but
that
was
not
enough,
for
a
year
and
a
half
later
the
house
of
representatives
meted
out
what
the
court
of
appeals
aptly
described
as
a
summary
reversal,
and
told
mr.
chadha
and
five
other
aliens
out
of
340
that
they
may
not
remain
in
the
country.
as
a
result,
the
immigration
service
had
no
choice
but
to
order
his
deportation.
despite
this
clear
causal
connection,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
insist
that
mr.
chadha
has
no
place
being
in
court.
they
say
he
lacks
standing,
that
there
is
no
adverseness,
it's
a
political
question,
and
that
he's
even
in
the
wrong
court.
indeed,
according
to
the
congress,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
he
is
barred
from
the
courthouse
door
is
that
the
attorney
general,
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
in
this
country,
has
concluded
that
the
veto
here
is
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
fully
considered
and
rejected
each
of
these
arguments.
our
brief
has
replied
to
them
also.
i
only
want
to
discuss
the
one
today
upon
which
the
congress
seems
to
place
principal
reliance,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
severability.
the
congress
has
said
that
the
veto
is
inseparable
from
the
rest
of
the
statute,
that
the
veto
was
at
the
core
of
scheme,
and
that
if
the
veto
is
invalid,
then
mr.
chadha
is
not
entitled
to
relief,
therefore
the
hardship
scheme
must
fall
in
its
entirety.
now,
in
answering
this
question
of
severability,
it
is
vital
to
focus
on
the
proper
inquiry.
this
court
held
in
both
buckley
against
valeo
and
the
champlin
refining
company
that
an
unconstitutional
provision
is
severable...
and
these
are
the
court's
words...
"unless
it
is
evident
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
strike
the
constitutional
portion
with
the
unconstitutional
portion.
"
thus,
under
this
court's
test,
the
burden
of
proof
lies
with
the
party
seeking
to
deny
severability.
moreover,
the
burden
increases,
as
in
this
case,
when
we
have
a
severability
provision,
as
we
do
in
section
406.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
did
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
determine.
the
1940
act
was
an
amendment
to
an
earlier
provision
of
the...
the
existing
immigration
act.
the
1952
amendments
were
a
comprehensive
revision
of
the
act.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out
that
in
1962,
when...
when
the
final
change
was
made
in
section
244(c)(2),
to
change
the
group
of
people
who
had
to
go
through
the
one-house
veto
as
opposed
to
the
two-house
approval,
which
still
remains
for
some
categories,
that
that
was
an
amendment
and
there
was
no
additional
severability
provision
at
that
time,
but
the
only
severability
provision
is
that,
and
we
don't
place
great
reliance
on
it,
but
we
think
it
is
some
additional
burden
that
is
placed
upon
the
party
seeking
to
destroy.
most
of
the
discussion
by
the
senate
and
house
here
has
been
offered
to
show
that
congress
wanted
to
retain
the
veto
device.
of
course
it
did.
it
put
it
in
there
in
the
first
place.
it
augmented
the
powers
of
congress
to
have
it.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
an
outside
group
was
lobbying
for
inclusion.
this
was
a
provision
intended
to
increase
the
power
of
the
congress
vis-a-vis
the
legislature
and
the
people.
the
proper
question,
we
submit,
and
the
question
which
is
simply
stated
in
another
way
in
buckley
and
champlin,
is
what
would
congress
have
done
if
it
had
known
that
the
veto
was
unconstitutional?
the
question
here
is,
and
it
must...
i
must
emphasize
that
it
is
a
question
that
we
have
to
ask
in
each
specific
case,
and
i
would
agree
with
justice
rehnquist,
for
instance,
that
the
question
of
severability
in
the
reorganization
act
is
a
much
harder
case.
there
are
no
reorganization
powers
currently
extant,
so
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is
possible
that
it's
difficult.
i
think
that
that
is...
that
is
in
a
way
the
inquiry
which
has
been
made
in
every
one
of
these
cases.
indeed,
it
is
made
in
the
case...
cases
involving
equal
protection
when
we
have
problems
of
underinclusion
or
overinclusion,
what
would
congress
have
wanted
to
do
if
it
knew...
if
it
couldn't
have
everything
in
the
statute
that
it
wanted
to
have,
and
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with
it.
the
case
cited
by
mr.
gressman,
the
california...
califano
against
wescott
had
to
deal
with
precisely
the
same
question,
and
i
might
say
dealt
with
it
in
every
case
after
reaching
the
constitutional
issue.
and
i
agree
that
it
is
difficult
in
theory,
but
we
have
to
make
these
determinations,
and
in
this
case,
however,
we
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
is
very
strong,
and
strongly
supports
the
conclusion
that
congress
would
not
have,
if
you
will,
thrown
out
the
baby
with
the
bath
water,
if
it
had
been
faced
with
that
choice,
and
i
base
that
on
the
progression
of
changes
that
were
made
from
1940
through
1962,
in
which
congress
showed
a
pattern
of
increasing
the
categories
of
eligible
people,
of
making
it
easier
for
those
found
eligible
to
obtain
a
hardship
stay
of
deportation,
and
further
from
the
congress's
willingness
to
lessen
the
controls
over
the
process.
indeed,
if
you
put
the
options
as
between
the
private
bill
analogy,
if
you
strike
242(c)(2),
and
leave
it
to
the
attorney
general
alone
analogy,
congress
between
1948
and
1952
tried
the
private
bill
analogy
within
months
after
the
bill
was
passed,
and
that
bill
required
two-house
approval
upon
a
recommendation
by
the
attorney
general.
everybody
in
congress
said
it
is
unworkable.
they
couldn't
deal
with
the
problem.
and
so
finally,
in
1952,
when
the
immigration
act
was
next
amended,
they
did
away
with
the
two-house
approval
for
large
segments
of
the
aliens
who
were
seeking
hardship
adjustments.
in
1962,
there
was
a
further
chipping
away
at
that.
the
congress
consistently
made
it
easier,
showed
that
they
did
not
want
the
job
of
going
through
the
private
bills.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
would
look
to
each
of
the
congresses
that
made
a
change
in
the
law.
that
is,
from...
the
first...
the
first
change
was
made
in
1940.
congress
didn't
like
the
private
bill,
so
they
gave
up
a
little
of
their
control.
in
1948,
having
found
that
there
were
21,000
of
these
applications
that
came
in
between
1940
and
1948,
congress
decided
it
would
try
to
exert
a
little
more
control,
since
it
had
vetoed
none
of
them
during
that
time.
in
1948,
congress
said,
we
will
exert
more
control.
in
1952,
and
in
fact
before,
the
next
congress
moved
in
that
progression,
said,
that
is
unworkable,
and
in
1962
they
have...
they
continued
that
even
further,
and
i
recognize
that
you
don't
have
an
instant...
you
can't
point
to
one...
one
congress,
but
even
the
most
recent
consideration
by
the
congress,
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
points
out,
congress
is
now
considering
abandoning
the
matter
entirely.
and
my
point
is
that
the
court
has
to
make
a
determination.
it
is
not
an
easy
determination
to
make.
you
have
to
try
to
figure
out
what
congress
would
have
done.
but
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
party
seeking
to
destroy,
and
not
the
party
seeking
to
sever,
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
it
is
not
evident,
as
this
court
has
used
the
term,
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
throw
out
this
whole
humanitarian
program,
and
indeed
perhaps
call
into
question
the
legality
of
aliens
who
have
already
run
the
congressional
gauntlet,
to
throw
this
entire
program
out
if
it
could
not
have
retained
the
veto.
it
is
just
too
small
a
portion.
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated,
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
who
have
to
go
through
the
congress
make
it
through.
only
two
people
have
been
vetoed
since
1977,
and
ten
in
the
previous
six
or
seven
years.
i
suggest
that
the
congress
has
not
made
its
case
for
lack
of
severability.
whatever
the
case
may
be
under
another
statute,
such
as
the
war
powers
act
or
reorganization
act,
it
hasn't
made
its
case
here.
turning
to
the
merits,
i
want
to
say
that
i
fully
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
position
here,
support
his
argument,
support
the
ninth
circuit,
and
also
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
consumer
energy
council
case.
i
want
to
focus,
if
i
can,
on
the
separation
of
powers
arguments,
and
particularly
before
doing
that
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
upon
which
counsel
for
the
house
places
such
great
reliance.
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
allowed
the
congress
to
pass
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
section
244.
that
is
because
those
were
passed
by
two
houses
of
congress,
with
opportunity
for
presidential
decision.
the
question,
though,
is,
does
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
the
alienage
clause
in
article
i,
section
8,
authorize
the
congress
to
do
what
the
house
of
representatives
did
in
this
case,
not
to
pass
a
statute,
but
to
exercise
control
over
a
decision
of
the
executive
branch,
and
we
suggest
to
you
that
whatever
powers
the
congress
may
have,
those
powers
are
exercised
by
two
houses
of
congress
and
the
president,
with
the
exception
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
constitution
such
as
the
treaty-making
and
appointments
provision,
which
are
themselves
forms
of
one-house
vetoes.
the
congress
has...
the
framers
specifically
put
those
in,
and
as
i
noted
in
my
brief,
this
court
in
myers
said,
we
will
not
lightly
imply
other
forms
of
one-house
vetoes,
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
so--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--if
by
independent
body
you
mean
persons
who
are
officers
of
the
united
states
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
or
otherwise
officers
within
the
meaning
of
buckley
against
valeo,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
the
problem
here
is
that
we
have
an
interbranch
blending
of
power,
where
the
congress...
what
has
happened
here
is
that
congress
is
seeking
to
assign
to
one
branch
of
it
the
power
to
control
the
activities
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
would
be...
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
--that
may
be
ironic,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i
believe
that
that
is
the
way
our
constitution
was
set
up.
that
is
a
terribly
important
aspect
of
what
the
framers
were
concerned
about.
they
were
concerned,
as
the
cases
and
the
debates
show,
of
blending
the
power
to
execute
the
law
with
the
power
to
make
the
law.
they
were
fearful
of
this
concentration
of
power
lest
tyranny
result,
and
the
tyranny
they
were
concerned
with
was
the
tyranny
of
the
legislature,
indeed,
particularly
the
house
of
representatives,
and
so
whatever
irony
there
may
seem
to
be,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
an
intentional
irony
in
our
constitutional
system,
designed
to
prevent
the
kind
of
activity
which
took
place
in
this
case
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
buckley
versus
valeo
teaches
me
that.
i
feel
compelled...
let
me
say
a
word...
the
senate...
the
congress's
response
to
all
of
this
is,
there
really
isn't
a
veto
here,
that
all
we
have
is
a
recommendation
going
from
the
attorney
general
to
the
congress.
the
difficulty...
there
are
two
basic
fallacies
with
that
argument.
first
is,
it
mischaracterizes
the
process
we
have
here.
if
four
more
days
had
taken
place,
had
passed,
jagdish
rai
chadha
would
have
successfully
run
the
congressional
gauntlet,
and
he
would
now
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
is
that
congress
stepped
in,
not
to
act
with
regard
to
a
recommendation,
but
to
veto
an
act
by
the
executive
branch.
the
only
thing
that
prevented
his
being
a
citizen
now
was
his
veto.
indeed,
the
house
and
senate
reports
in
1952,
when
the
process
went
back
from
two-house
approval
to
one-house
veto,
described
this
process
as
action
by
the
congress
of
an
adverse
action
on
the
alien,
so
it
is
pretty
clear
in
terms
it
is
not
that.
moreover,
all
doubt
is
removed
if
you
consider
what
happened
to
the
other
334
aliens
who
were
up
before
the
congress
at
the
same
time.
according
to
the
congress,
these
recommendations
were
approved
by
silence,
and
that
silence
is
the
equivalent
in
constitutional
terms
to
legislation.
thus,
justice
brennan,
you
asked
earlier
whether
congress
still
has
a
role
after,
for
instance,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
something.
i
would
say
to
you
that
nothing
in
the
statute
would
change
the
role.
it
appears
that
once...
the
court
of
appeals
would
then
issue
a
decision,
it
would
go
back
to
the
executive,
and
then
it
would
go
up
to
the
congress.
our
constitutional
system
provides
that
laws
shall
be
made
by
the
vote
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
and
not
by
the
silence
of
its
members,
yet
if
you
accept
the
recommendation
analysis,
you
would
have
to
accept
that
members
can
vote
by
their
silence.
thank
your
honors.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
defending
against
the
presentation
clause
and
separation
of
powers
arguments
made
by
respondents
here,
the
senate
and
house
argue
most
clearly
perhaps
in
the
house
of
representatives
supplemental
brief
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
the
power
of
congress
over
aliens.
we
submit
that
that
is
no
more
true
here
than
was
the
question
of
the
power
of
congress
over
elections
at
issue
in
buckley
against
valeo,
or
the
power
of
congress
over
bankruptcy
at
issue
last
term
in
the
marathon
pipeline
case.
the
question
is
not,
we
submit,
what
is
the
power
of
congress,
but
by
what
means
must
congress
exercise
that
power
over
aliens
in
this
case.
any
time
it
wants,
congress,
that
is
two
houses
and
the
president
concurring
together,
can
change
the
law.
they
can
eliminate
section
244
entirely.
they
can
make
us
go
back
to
the
days
of
private
bills.
they
can
import
new
standards
of
flexibility.
they
can
have
more
or
less
of
it
as
congress
chooses.
what
congress
cannot
do,
what
the
constitution
forbids
it
from
doing,
is
to
delegate
to
one
house
of
congress
the
power
to
make
those
changes
in
the
law
and
to
perform
those
functions
regarding
aliens.
now,
congress
tries
to
avoid
this
argument
and
by
avoiding
the
argument
of
the
requirements
of
article
i
by
saying
that
we
don't
have
action
by
congress
here
and
that
all
that
happened
was
that
the
attorney
general
had
made
a
recommendation
to
congress
and
that
recommendation
failed
passage
in
the
house
of
representatives,
and
therefore
like
so
many
other
recommendations
that
fail
it
does
not
implicate
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
7,
of
the
constitution.
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
it
neither
comports
with
the
operation
of
section
244
nor
does
it
deal
with
or
fit
in
with
our
constitutional
requirements
under
article
i
for
lawmaking.
this
is
best
illustrated,
i
suggest,
by
examining
the
entire
matter
that
was
before
congress
in
1975
when
mr.
chadha
and
five
others
were
vetoed.
340
aliens
had
the
attorney
general's
approval.
only
six,
mr.
chadha
among
them,
were
disapproved
by
house
resolution
926.
viewed
alone,
that
might
be
seen
simply
as
saying
that
they
failed
of
approval
like
other
recommendations
failed
of
approval.
this,
however,
doesn't
account
for
the
fact
that
334
other
aliens
who
were
sent
up
in
the
same
general
time
frame
as
mr.
chadha
became
three
days
later
than
the
house
resolution
926
was
passed
entitled
to
have
their
status
adjusted,
simply
because
of
the
passage
of
time
and
the
fact
that
no
resolution
of
disapproval
had
been
introduced
in
either
house
for
them.
so
that
we
have
a
situation
in
which
334
aliens
had
their
status
adjusted,
according
to
the
senate
and
the
house,
by
the
passage
of
time
and
acquiescence
by
silence,
and
mr.
chadha
and
five
other
unfortunate
aliens
had
their
status
referred
back
to
deportability
by
the
action
of
a
single
house
of
congress.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
have
trouble
with
the
non-legislation
versus
legislation.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
silence
means
is
much
more
clearly
in
terms
of
it
defining
what
the
action
meant.
that
is,
that
the
action
was
adverse
action
to
mr.
chadha
and
five
others
and
it
wasn't
simply
the
failure
of
recommendation,
because
silence
under
our
constitution,
article
i,
section
7,
does
not
enable
a
law
to
be
passed.
laws
are
passed
by
two
houses
of
congress
with
the
concurrence
of
the
president
or
a
two-thirds
vote
overriding
his
veto,
and
that
is
not
what
happened
with
respect
to
any
of
the
334
aliens.
therefore,
i
conclude
that
the
description
as
mere
failure
of
approval
of
mr.
chadha
and
five
others
is
wholly
inaccurate,
as
it
would
be
inaccurate
and
unconstitutional
to
say
that
the
other
334
could
have
successfully
had
their
status
changed
simply
by
the
passage
of
time.
in
fact,
of
course
in
this
case
the
reason
that
mr.
chadha's
status
was
adjusted
was
because
of
the
veto,
and
this
veto
is
not
something
that's
authorized
by
the
constitution.
ours
is
a
system
of
limited
powers.
the
framers
did
not
provide
for
one-house
vetoes
over
aliens,
although
they
did
provide
for
two
one-house
vetoes
in
the
constitution
itself,
both
of
them
by
the
senate,
over
the
power
of
the
president
to
make
treaties
and
the
president's
powers
of
appointment.
those
are
explicit
one-house
vetoes.
they're
contained
in
the
constitution,
and
their
absence
here
makes
it
more
compelling
that
the
court
should
not
imply
that
congress
is
authorized
through
one
house
to
veto
actions
of
the
executive.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
contend
that
the
action
by
the
house
of
representatives
here
is
unauthorized
under
the
constitution
and
hence
is
not
proper
within
the
meaning
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
house
and
senate.
in
defining
the
scope
of
the
term
"proper"
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
this
court
in
marbury
versus
madison
required
that
the
legislation
be
both
necessary
and
proper
and,
in
terms
of
propriety,
that
it
meet
both
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution.
not
only
does
this
veto
run
contrary
to
the
specific
requirements
of
the
constitution,
but
it
also
violates
its
spirit.
the
veto
here
is
nothing
more
than
a
legislative
shortcut,
and
because
of
the
legislative
shortcut
it
eliminates
the
role
of
the
president
and
the
other
house.
but
it
also
runs
counter
to
the
entire
process
by
which
we...
the
framers
established
our
lawmaking,
under
which
deliberation
was
the
keynote,
and
the
precipitous
action
by
a
single
house
prevented...
would
not
comport
with
the
need
to
have
well-considered
deliberative
decisions
made.
this
point
about
the
need
for
deliberative
decisions
relates
to
another
point
i
want
to
make,
and
that
is
that
although
the
activities
here
are
portrayed
as
an
interbranch
struggle,
this
case
illustrates
that
the
lives
of
individuals
are
very
much
at
stake
in
controversies
such
as
this.
that
is,
that
the
legislative
veto
is
more
than
a
battle
between
the
president
and
the
congress.
similarly,
our
constitutional
system
was
established
not
simply
to
have
a
bicameral
system
with
each
house
being
individually
represented
and
the
president
assured
of
a
role
as
a
means
of
satisfying
three
separate
power
blocs.
it
was
not
given
to
do
the
lawmaking
in
order
to
assure
that
each
had
a
share
of
the
legislative
pie.
the
framers
were
concerned
with
the
avoidance
of
unwise,
oppressive,
discriminatory
or
hasty
legislation,
and
in
order
to
do
that
they
established
procedures
with
sufficient
checks
and
balances
built
into
them
to
make
it
far
more
difficult
for
congress
to
act
in
a
precipitous
manner.
and
it
is
these
institutional
checks
against
unwarranted
and
unwise
action,
as
much
as
the
formal
requirements
of
the
constitution,
that
the
veto
transgresses.
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
it.
the
attorney
general,
after
carefully
considering
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
statutes,
the
precedents,
concluded
in
a
formal
proceeding
that
mr.
chadha
was
entitled
to
an
adjustment
of
status
and
to
remain
in
this
country.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
it
is
a
power
to
carry
out
the
laws
and
to
administer
the
laws,
an
executive
power.
i
believe
that
the
violation
here
can
very
well
be
seen
as
either
lawmaking
by
the
congress
through
the
house
of
representatives
or
it
can
be
viewed
as
improper
interference
with
the
executive
carrying
out
of
the
function.
in
the
senate
supplemental
brief
they
make
four
separate
references
to
this
desire
to
share
the
responsibility
for
carrying
out
the
laws.
that
is
precisely
what
the
constitution
forbids.
so
if
you
view
what
the
house
did
as
lawmaking,
it
runs
afoul
of
article
i,
section
7.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
view
it
as
sharing
the
responsibility,
it
runs
afoul
of
the
separation
of
powers
principles
which
are
throughout
our
constitution.
congress
makes
the
law;
it
does
not
carry
out
the
law.
finally,
to
the
extent
that
you
could
view
what
congress
did
here...
and
in
part
because
of
the
very
hasty
proceedings
and
the
rather
cryptic
remarks
by
congressman
eilberg,
it's
impossible
to
tell
precisely
what
was
in
the
minds
of
even
congressman
eilberg,
let
alone
the
rest
of
them.
if
you
view
that
as
an
action
in
which
they
were
judging,
as
article
iii
judges
would
judge,
whether
the
attorney
general
had
complied
with
the
statute,
then
once
again
the
congress
is
performing
a
judicial
function.
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
so
much
as
though
they
are
interfering
with
any
article
iii
judge,
but
that
members
of
congress
would
be
performing
a
function
which
our
constitution
has
reserved
for
article
iii
judges.
the
point
is
important
because
it
gets
out
of
the
conundrum
of
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
label
the
action
of
congress.
in
our
view,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
house
of
representatives
was
doing.
if
it
was
engaging
in
judicial
activities
or
executive
activities,
then
it
runs
afoul
of
separation
of
powers.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
was
engaged
in
legislative
activities
it
failed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
7.
so
that
viewed
in
any
of
these
ways
the
legislative
veto
is
improper.
indeed,
it
makes
it
clear
that
it's
improper
whether
or
not
the
agency
performing
the
function
being
vetoed
was
an
executive
agency
or
an
independent
regulatory
commission,
as
it
is
in
the
two
other
cases
that
are
pending.
similarly,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
activity
was
adjudication,
either
formal
or
informal
adjudication,
or
whether
it
was
rulemaking,
formal
or
informal.
the
focus
in
the
challenge
here
and
in
the
other
cases
is
on
the
legality
of
what
the
house
of
representatives
or
the
two
houses
of
congress
acting
without
the
president
did.
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
particular
activity
that
the
executive
performed
was,
because
we
are
questioning
here
the
legality
of
what
the
congress
did.
and
for
that
reason,
a
decision
here
would
carry
with
it
a
decision
that
all
of
the
vetoes
are
unconstitutional
for
the
same
analytical
reasons
that
we've
suggested
here.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
say
that
the
attempt
to
postpone
the
decision
is
not,
an
attempt
to
postpone
the
decision
on
this
case,
is
one
that
ought
to
be
accepted.
this
case
presents
precisely
what
is
wrong
with
the
veto...
a
congressional
interference
in
a
non-lawmaking
capacity
with
what
the
executive
branch
has
done.
and
for
that
reason,
under
either
of
the
three
analyses
i've
set
forth
the
veto
is
unconstitutional
and
should
be
set
aside.
thank
you,
your
honor.
