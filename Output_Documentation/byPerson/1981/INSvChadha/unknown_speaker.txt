unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gressman,
do
you
think
that
cases
like
united
states
against
myers
involving
the
firing
of
a
postmaster,
and
buckley
against
valeo,
involving
the
method
of
appointment
to
the
federal
election
commission,
violate
mcculloch
against
maryland?
unknown
speaker
does
united
states
against
lovett
have
something
to
do
with
this,
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
that
an
effort,
at
least
so
justice
black's
opinion
reached
a
conclusion
that
congress
was
undertaking
to
terminate
the
employment
of
an
executive
branch
officer
without
any
due
process.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
think
the
bill
of
attainder
is
the
only
basis
on
which
that
result
is
supportable
in
the
lovett
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gressman,
may
i
ask
you,
you
rely
on
the
power
to
pass
private
naturalization
bills,
i
understand.
are
those
bills
consistent
with
the
constitutional
requirement
that
naturalization
bills
must
be
uniform?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that...
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
it
has
nothing
to
do,
you
suggest,
with
naturalization?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
doesn't,
is
a
naturalization
bill
a
little
broader
than
just--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
does
it
include
deportation
bills,
too?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
what
you
are
saying
is...
of
course,
i
guess
the
question
isn't
here...
that
the
uniformity
provision
in
any
event
does
not
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
you
couldn't
do
that
in
the
case
of
the
judicial
branch,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
say
that
a
court
is
given
kind
of
certiorari-like
jurisdiction
to
make
recommendations
to
congress.
unknown
speaker
does
that
suggest,
mr.
gressman,
that...
i
gather
the
action
of
the
attorney
general,
suppose
he
refuses
to
grant
the
suspension.
that
is
judicial
review,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
that
it
is
reviewed,
and
the
court
says,
no,
the
attorney
general
is
wrong,
he
should
have
granted
the
suspension.
unknown
speaker
may
congress
then
step
in
under
the
statute
and--
unknown
speaker
--no,
that
is
not
the
case
i
put
to
you.
unknown
speaker
it
is
where
he
refuses
it.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
says
he
should
have
granted
it.
unknown
speaker
then
my
interest
was
whether
or
not
the
congress
then
could
step
in
and
pass
a
suspension.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
what
was
said
in
waterman
rather
indicates
that
congress
could
not,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
except,
mr.
gressman,
this
was
an
action
of
the
immigration
subcommittee,
wasn't
it?
and
what
the
immigration
subcommittee
said
was,
it
was
the
feeling
of
the
committee
that
chadha
did
not
meet
the
statutory
requirements,
particularly
as
it
relates
to
hardships.
now,
is
that
a
legislative
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
it
said
was
that
chadha
did
not
meet
statutory
requirements.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
an
adjudicatory
act?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
what
is
involved,
i
think,
is,
did
congress
perform
a
legislative
act
in
that
determination?
congress
can't
do
other
than
legislative
action,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
where
does
congress
get
the
right
to
pardon?
unknown
speaker
that
gave
congress
the
right
to
pardon?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
word.
you
said
pardon.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
of
us
can
point
to
the
pardon
power
of
the
president.
unknown
speaker
in
haec
verba.
but
you
can't
even
get
close
to
verba,
let
alone
in
haec,
as
to
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
when
the
congress
took
the
kind
of
action
that
you
just
described,
was
that
after
a
proceeding
in
the
immigration
service
or
before?
unknown
speaker
you
are
speaking
now
of
the
private
bill
process.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
am
talking
about
what
was
actually
taking
place
in
the
past,
not--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
your
proposal
as
to
the
test
we
should
apply
for
severability?
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
court
do
with
the
severability
clause
that
congress
itself
enacted,
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
get
to
severability
until
you
first
decide
the
constitutional
question,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
that
hasn't
been
true
in
cases
where
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
constitutional
argument
that
a
part
of
a
statute
is
invalid.
there
is
just
no
need
to
pass
on
the
issue
of
severability
until
you
find
that
part
of
a
statute
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
you
can
cite
for
that
proposition,
that
you
first
take
up
severability
and
then
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
any
case
from
this
court
that
takes
up
severability
before
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
mr.
davidson,
are
you
going
to
reach
the...
are
you
going
to
touch
upon
or
are
you
going
to
leave
to
your
brief
the
question...
the
related
question
of
whether
mr.
chadha
has
other...
possible
other
grounds
for
relief
that
would
also
perhaps
serve
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
that
act
has
been
adopted
since
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
prior
to
it.
then,
when
was
his
marriage?
unknown
speaker
so
both
of
these
developments
occurred
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
both
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
rejected?
unknown
speaker
was
that
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
rehearing
en
banc?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
perhaps
not
related?
could
the
house
or
the
congress
delegate
this
veto
function
to
the
judiciary
committee
of
either
house
or
of
the
two
houses
acting
together?
unknown
speaker
do
you
find
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
the
constitution
explicitly
grants
certain
powers
to
the
senate
acting
alone,
that
is,
the
treaty
and
the
appointment
powers,
but
that
the
constitution
is
silent
on
this
subject?
unknown
speaker
mr.
davidson,
may
i
follow
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question
about
delegation
to
a
committee?
i
can
understand
why
you
say
that
would
be
a
different
case
when
we
are
considering
the
issue
of
separation
of
powers,
but
when
we
are
considering
what
i
understand
to
be
your
principal
argument,
namely,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
why
couldn't
that
be
equally
necessary
and
proper
to
use
a
more
efficient
way
of
processing
these
things?
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
be
sure
you
understand
my
question.
if
we
were
focusing
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
then
we
could
not
distinguish
an
action
by
the
whole
house
and
action
by
a
committee,
could
we?
unknown
speaker
if
we
are
buying
mr.
gressman's
argument.
unknown
speaker
which
political
branch
would
you
have
us
defer
to
here?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
myers,
the
president
in
office
at
the
time
the
law
was
passed
had
signed
it.
in
buckley
against
valeo,
the
president
in
office
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed
had
signed
it.
that
has
never
been
thought
to
be
a
reason
for
finally
resolving
the
separation
of
powers
on
kind
of
an
estoppel
basis.
unknown
speaker
is
this
something
like
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
one
of
the
four
presidents
said
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
just
didn't
take
any
action.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
they
approved
it
and
they
loved
it.
unknown
speaker
were
you
just
about
to
say
they
loved
it?
unknown
speaker
not
quite,
but
you--
--i
won't
say
they
loved
it.
in
fact,
for
administrative
reasons,
some
may
have
wished
it
to
be
done
in
another
way,
as
president
eisenhower
proposed
an
alternative
mechanism.
this
legislation
was
considered
in
tandem
in
1939
through
1962
with
the
reorganization
legislation,
and
in
the
reorganization
field,
presidents
repeatedly
asked
for
the
renewal
of
that
authority
as
a
cooperative
relationship
which
they
thought
important
to
both
branches.
in
this
area,
attorney
generals
would
ask
for
renewal
or
revisions
of
the
authority
without
indicating
at
all
that
there
was
a
constitutional
problem.
it
is
important
before
the
court
involve
itself
in
that
kind
of
issue
to
determine
whether
this
has
been
fairly
considered
in
the
executive
and
with
the
congress.
and
although
there
have
been
executive
objections
to
other
legislative
review
statutes,
there
has
been
none
to
this.
it
was
enacted,
revised,
and
has
worked
a
totally
beneficial
purpose.
mr.
davidson,
i
guess
we
don't
reach
these
questions
unless
we
get
over
the
various
justiciability
hurdles
that
have
been
raised,
and
you
spoke
about
one
of
them,
and
mentioned
that
because
mr.
chadha
now
is
married
to
a
citizen,
and
because
of
the
passage
of
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
that
he
has
gotten
everything
that
he
wanted.
let
me
just
ask
you
a
further
question
about
that,
if
i
may.
now,
i
assume
that
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
lower
court,
that
then
mr.
chadha
would
be
immediately
eligible
to
apply
for
citizenship,
whereas
if
we
did
not
do
that,
these
other
acts
would
not
enable
him
to
do
that
for
a
number
of
years.
does
that
make
a
difference,
so
the
questions
really
are
not
resolved?
unknown
speaker
has
there
ever
been
a
statute
held
invalid
by
this
court
beginning
with
the
jurisdictional
statute
that
was
involved
in
marbury
against
madison,
in
which
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
statute
had
the
blessing
of
the
two
houses
and
the
president?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
interrupt
you
on
that?
unknown
speaker
when
the
attorney
general
exercises
his
power
to
suspend
deportation,
is
he
exercising
legislative
power?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
one
argue
that
what
the
house
does
is
precisely
the
same
thing
the
attorney
general
has
done?
unknown
speaker
i
observe,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
both
you
and
your
friends
have
referred
to
this
as
legislative
veto,
not
as
it
is
sometimes
called,
one
house
veto.
does
that
mean
in
your
view
and
perhaps
his
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
one
house
or
both
houses
if
it
isn't
legislative
action
in
what
you
have
just
described
as
the
traditional
way?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
both
the
house
and
the
senate
had
taken
this
action,
you
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
lee,
i
think
that
the
house
and
senate,
though,
have
taken
the
position
that
this
particular
legislation
was
in
fact
passed
by
both
houses
and
presented
to
the
president,
and
therefore
met
all
the
requirements.
would
you
address
yourself
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
want
to
press
your
argument
a
moment.
legislative
power,
i
presume,
could
be
delegated
in
some
situations
to
somebody
that
will
act
other
than
by...
through
the
presentment
process.
unknown
speaker
say,
delegate
to
an
administrative
agency
the
process
of
drafting
regulation.
unknown
speaker
what
if,
in
this
statute,
instead
of
having
a
one-house
veto
they
created
a
special
administrative
review
board,
some
special,
unusual
name
for
it,
of
three
persons
appointed
by
the
president,
or
something
like
that,
who
would
then
make
precisely
the
decision
at
the
same
end
of
the
process
that
the
full
house
now
makes.
would
that
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
it
would
execute
the
law
through
that--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
it
would
follow
a
fortiori
also
they
couldn't
give
such
power
to
a
committee
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
requirement
in
the
statute
was
simply
that
the
recommendations
of
the
attorney
general
for
hardship
relief
lie
on
the
table
of
congress
for
60
days,
will
not
become
effective?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the...
is
there
that
much
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
also
putting
a
tail
end
limitation
on
what
would
otherwise
be
the
final
action
of
the
executive.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
law
just
said
that
the
attorney
general
should
take
these
cases
and
then
make
a
recommendation
to
congress
as
to
whether...
as
to
wherever
he
thought
suspension
was
authorized.
the
same
result
as
here?
unknown
speaker
it
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
makes
a
recommendation,
he
makes
a
recommendation
for
suspension.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
the
law
says,
please,
mr.
attorney
general,
look
at
these
cases
and
make
recommendations
where
you
think
suspension
should
be
authorized,
and
then
one
house
would
have
the
power
to
disagree.
unknown
speaker
no,
take
my
example,
mr.
solicitor
general.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
you
just
didn't
listen.
mr.
attorney
general,
please
give
a
recommendation,
and
then
if
one
house
vetoes
your
recommendation,
then
he
is
going
to
be
deported.
unknown
speaker
the
attorney
general's
judgment
stands.
unknown
speaker
just
like
this.
unknown
speaker
so
it
really
isn't
the
adjudication
or
judicial
review
or
anything
else.
he
just
makes
a
recommendation.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
before
this
statute
was
passed,
or
before
they...
in
the
era
of
private
bills--
unknown
speaker
--in
order
to
suspend
deportation,
there
had
to
be
legislative
action.
unknown
speaker
now,
this
bill
leaves
the
president
and
the
congress,
talking
about
the
separation
of
powers
issue--
unknown
speaker
--in
relatively
the
same
position,
doesn't
it?
the
president
takes
the
initiative
here,
and
recommends
a
suspension,
and
that
would
take
the
agreement
of
both
houses.
unknown
speaker
but
it
still
takes
on...
it
would
still
leave
the...
in
order
to
have
a
suspension,
it
would
still
take
the
agreement
of
the
president
and
both
houses
of
congress,
under
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true,
but
it
still
leaves
the...
in
relatively
the
same
position
as
before
the
statute
was--
unknown
speaker
--with
respect
to
suspension
of
deportation.
unknown
speaker
where
does
the
government
stand
on
severability?
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
government
take
any
position
on
severability?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
we
reach
the
issue
on
the
merits,
and
decide
it
in
your
favor.
then
what
is
your
position
on
severability?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
should
think
that
future
administrations
might
have
some
cause
to
regret
you
analysis
of
severability
when
they
go
to
congress
and
want
legislation,
because
in
effect
congress
gives
more
than
it
otherwise
would
have
in
return
for
the
legislative
veto,
and
then
the
next
day
after
signing
it
the
president
sends
his
attorney
general
to
court
to
challenge
the
legislative
veto.
so
in
effect
the
compromise
is
just
washed
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
question
on
the
merits,
but
on
the
severability
issue
it
seems
to
me
you
are
being
kind
of
piggy.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
have
to
reach
it
if
you
decide
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
let
me
get
straight,
with
respect
to
our
previous
colloquy,
if
the
statute
simply
said,
please
recommend
suspensions
of
deportation,
look
over
the
cases
and
recommend,
but
if
we
don't
do
anything
at
all,
then
there
will
be
no
suspension,
that
is
constitutional,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
analogy
at
all
to
the
rulemaking
process
that
we
have
where
the
judicial
conference
after
studying
criminal,
civil,
or
appellate
rules,
proposes
rules,
and
then
they
come
to
the
judicial
conference,
then
they
come
to
this
court,
then
they
go
over
to
congress,
and
if
nothing
happens
over
there
within
a
specified
period,
they
become
defective?
now--
unknown
speaker
--take
particularly
the
code
of
evidence,
which
was
cast
in
terms
of
rule.
congress
made
a
significant
number
of
changes,
or
at
least
there
were
significant
changes,
if
not
great
in
number.
was
that
making
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
perhaps
you
have
already
told
us,
but
i
have
forgotten.
what
is
your
reaction
to
the
effect,
if
any,
of
the
recent
marriage
of
mr.
chadha?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
bearing
does
it
have
on
whether
or
not
we
should
reach
the
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
got
standing,
but...
but
not
reaching
constitutional
issues
is
prudential,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lee,
in
the
reorganization
situation,
where
there
is
a...
is
there
a
one-house
veto?
unknown
speaker
so
the
president
is
proposing
a
reorganization
which
is
proper
unless
congress--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
say
that
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
pretty
well
have
to
take
that
position,
i
suppose,
to--
unknown
speaker
--to
have
it
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
do
you
think
the
reorganization
act
is
severable,
so
the
president
could
just
reorganize
by
himself?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
despite
your
own.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
morrison,
this
all
happens
if
we
do
what,
or
don't
do
what?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
don't?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
don't
reach
the
constitutional
question
by
reason
of
his
marriage,
what
then
will
we
do
with
the
judgment
below?
unknown
speaker
and
what
will
happen
to
his
case?
it
will
be,
what,
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
as
if
it
were
moot?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
remand
for
exploration
of
the
matters
raised
in
the
colloquy?
unknown
speaker
did
he
take
any
actions
under...
did
he
ask
his
wife
to
file
a
petition
as
soon
as
he
was
married,
or
did
he
take--
unknown
speaker
--some
actions
under
the
refugee
act?
unknown
speaker
could
he
have?
unknown
speaker
and
would
have
been
succeeded
by
now?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
be
then
still
maybe
three
more
years.
unknown
speaker
and
the
house
and
senate
are
in
this
case
only
as
intervenors,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
the
actual
case
is
between
him
and
the
service.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
perhaps
i
missed
it
in
the
record,
but
why
was
the
submission
to
the
ninth
circuit
withheld
for
over
two
years?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
withholding
order
was
within
four
days
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--original
argument.
unknown
speaker
was
it
reargued?
unknown
speaker
did
the
1940
act
in
which
this
provision
originally
appeared
have
a
severability
provision?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that...
if
you
are
talking
about
legislative
intent,
that
is
kind
of
a
difficult
inquiry
to
make
42
years
after
the
act
was
passed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrison,
you
are
using
the
term
"congress
wanted"
in
a
rather
undifferentiated
meaning,
it
seems
to
me.
which
congress
do
we
look
to
for
intent?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree,
counsel,
that
if
the
veto
were
to
be
exercised
by
an
independent
body,
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
power
to
control
were
exercised
by
a
body
of
six
persons,
two
of
whom
were
legislators?
unknown
speaker
the
irony
of
your
position,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
one
class
of
persons
who
may
not
exercise
delegated
legislative
power
are
people
whose
primary
business
in
government
is
lawmaking.
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
suggest,
then,
that
if
the...
if
the
body
vested
with
the
power
to
disapprove
was
the
majority
leader
of
the
senate
and
the
speaker
of
the
house,
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
the
text
of
that
resolution,
mr.
gressman?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true
that
had
the
resolution
not
passed
all
four
of
the
consequences
you've
described
would
have
taken
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
non-legislation
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
say
it
happens
across
the
street
365
days
a
year--
unknown
speaker
--whether
congress
is
in
session
or
not.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
consequence
of
926
on
the
action
of
the
service
and
of
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
then
i'm
confused
about
your
statements
which
i
thought
i
heard
that
this
didn't
alter
chadha's
rights.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
had
no
rights
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
have
a
right
to
have
the
attorney
general
grant
the
dispensation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gressman,
if
the
bill...
instead
of
having
the
resolution
having
been
agreed
to,
supposing
the
majority
had
voted
down
the
resolution.
would
that
have
been
an
act
of
legislation
or
non-legislation?
unknown
speaker
if
this
resolution
had
been
submitted
but
it
had
failed,
and
the
vote
and
the
action
in
not
passing
the
resolution,
in
your
view
would
that
have
been
legislation
or
non-legislation?
unknown
speaker
no,
they
just
never
submitted
it
to
the
other
house.
it
just
was
this
particular
bill
had
failed.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
resulted
in
a
change
of
status,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
action
presented
to
the
senate.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
thing
that
is
presented
is
a
house
resolution
is
presented
and
it
fails.
now,
does
the
vote
on
that
result
in
legislation
or
non-legislation?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
change
of
status,
though,
wouldn't
it,
assuming
no
action
in
the
senate?
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is--
unknown
speaker
--would
that
have
been
legislation
or
non-legislation?
unknown
speaker
so
it
depends
on
whether
the
resolution
carries
or
not--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
what
the
character
of
it
is?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
without
charging
your
colleague
for
the
time,
mr.
gressman.
you
are
familiar
with
the
statutory
provision
in
which
the
congress
has
delegated
to
the
district
courts
the
trial
of
cases
for
contempt
of
congress.
suppose
one
of
those
cases
is
delegated
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
it
tries
it
and
finds
the
man
not
guilty
of
contempt.
can
the
house
reverse
that,
or
the
senate,
or
both
of
them
together?
unknown
speaker
having
delegated--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
wasn't
a
judicial
power
in
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
power
that
belonged
to
the
house
and
the
senate
individually.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--now,
one
of
the
reasons,
if
not
the
dominant
reason,
for
congress
taking
that
action
was
that
it
was
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
congress
to
undertake
to
try
contempt
cases--
unknown
speaker
--because
it
interfered
with
their
business.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gressman.
mr.
gressman,
may
i
inquire
also
whether
historically
the
congress
has
used
its
sovereign
power
over
aliens
to
enact
specific
legislation
to
deport
specific
individuals?
unknown
speaker
to
give
them
relief--
unknown
speaker
--or
give
them
status
as
permanent
residents.
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
deport.
unknown
speaker
mr.
davidson,
you
have
15
minutes,
without
being
charged
with
any
of
our
recent
colloquy.
unknown
speaker
you're
adhering
to
your
position
here
in
this
particular
case
that
the
statute
is
not
severable?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
anyone
challenging
the
plenary
power
of
congress
over
these
broad
matters
of
immigration?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
bear
on
your
severability
argument,
too?
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
executive
get
into
the
process
at
the
stage
of
resolution
926?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
makes
you
think
that
you're
going
to
find
explicit
provision
for
everything
the
congress
can
do
in
the
constitution?
the
president
certainly
has
issued
innumerable
executive
orders
since
the
beginning
of
the
nation
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
article
i
that
talks
about
executive
orders...
article
ii.
unknown
speaker
general
lee,
as
i
recall
it
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
rested
both
on
the
usurping
or
interference
with
the
executive
power
and
also
on
interference
with
the
judicial
power.
do
you
assert
both
of
those
grounds
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
had
exercised
the
judicial
power
that
was
being
interfered
with?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
a
judicial
determination.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
didn't
go
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
congress'
overriding
of
the
attorney
general's
executive
decision
is
an
interference
with
the
judicial
power?
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
be
more
accurate
to
describe
the
attorney
general's
power,
whatever
it
is,
as
something
in
the
nature
of
a
quasi-judicial
power?
unknown
speaker
are
there
other
areas
where
that
kind
of
quasi-judicial
power
is
delegated
to
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
that
silence
equated
to
non-legislation?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
characterize
the
attorney
general's
power
that
was
delegated
to
him,
mr.
morrison?
unknown
speaker
mr.
davidson,
if
you
lose
this
case
congress
can
recapture
all
the
powers
that
it
wants
to
recapture,
just
repeal
the
provision
that's
at
issue.
