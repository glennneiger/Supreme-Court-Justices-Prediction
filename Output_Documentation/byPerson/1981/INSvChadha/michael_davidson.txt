mr.
michael
davidson
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
between
1934
and
1940,
the
congress
and
the
executive
were
at
an
impasse
over
the
question
of
relief
from
deportation.
the
impasse
had
resulted
from
the
inability
of
those
two
branches
to
reconcile
the
desire
of
the
executive
for
discretionary
authority
to
waive
mandatory
deportation
laws,
and
the
prevalent
belief
in
the
congress
that
to
grant
such
discretion
would
be
to
advocate
its
responsibility
over
the
immigration
act.
in
1940,
the
congress
and
the
executive
resolved
their
stalemate
by
agreeing
to
a
compromise,
since
amended
into
section
244,
by
which
they
have
since
cooperated
in
granting
permanent
residence
to
thousands
of
deportable
aliens.
the
executive
now
asserts
that
there
was
a
fundamental
constitutional
defect
in
that
accommodation,
and
that
this
court
should
now
revise
the
legislative
bargain
to
give
to
the
executive
the
very
power
which
the
congress
had
refused
to
grant
to
it.
mr.
michael
davidson
all
actions
by
the
congress
under
this
statute
are
after
proceedings
before
the
immigration
service,
where
the
immigration
service
makes
two
judgments
by
delegation
from
the
attorney
general.
mr.
michael
davidson
no,
i
am
talking
only
about
this--
mr.
michael
davidson
--prior
to
1940,
and
only
several
years
prior
to
that,
the
congress
considered
these
matters
as
private
bills.
up
to
1937,
it
had
in
fact
insisted
on
mandatory
adherence
to
mandatory
deportation
laws.
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
the
prescription
which
is
given
to
the
congress,
that
it
should
be
more
exact
in
its
legislative
classifications,
was
indeed
the
very
illness
of
the
times.
the
congress
was
exact.
the
laws
were
precise,
and
there
was
no
relief
from
them.
the
executive
came
to
the
congress
and
said,
in
the
interest
of
humanity,
there
should
be
a
procedure
for
relief.
but
year
after
year,
the
congress
refused
to
grant
that
until
they
fashioned
this
accommodation
whereby
both
branches
would
participate
in
that
decision.
two
principal
questions
are
presented
by
the
executive's
claim.
the
first
is
whether
the
court
may
sever
and
refashion
the
statute
to
grant
to
the
executive
the
precise
statutory
power
which
the
congress
had
refused
to
delegate
to
that
branch.
second
is
whether
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
requires
the
court
to
deny
to
the
two
political
branches
that
means
of
compromise
and
accommodation.
severability
is
a
statutory
question,
but
in
this
case
it
is
also
an
important
question
of
separation
of
powers.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
introductory
subsection
to
244
could
be
severed
from
the
remainder
of
the
section,
and
stand
as
an
independent
grant
of
final
authority
to
the
executive,
but
respondents
do
not
defend
that
precise
holding
in
their
briefs.
the
central
feature
of
the
compromise
of
1940
was
participation
by
the
congress
in
the
granting
of
permanent
residence
to
deportable
aliens.
the
text
of
the
statute
confirms
this,
because
the
attorney
general
may
only
cancel
a
deportation
if
neither
house
disapproves.
this
is
why
respondents
urge
this
court
to
ask
a
very
different
question
than
has
ever
been
put
to
the
court
on
the
question
of
severability,
and
that
is,
what
would
congress
have
done
if
it
had
known
that
this
court
years
later
would
find
unconstitutional
a
procedure
chosen
by
congress.
the
degree
to
which
the
respondents'
test
would
ask
the
court
to
become
involved
in
the
legislative
process
is
illustrated
by
the
history
of
section
244.
the
congress
chose
and
adhered
to
the
basic
design
of
this
section
in
the
course
of
rejecting
a
variety
of
alternatives.
even
if
the
court
thought
that
it
was
within
its
power
to
make
a
second
choice
for
the
congress,
it
would
be
difficult
to
know
which
second
choice
to
make.
among
the
diverse
second
choices
rejected
by
the
congress
have
been
the
following.
in
1937,
representative
diaz
proposed
that
the
executive
be
granted
this
final
authority,
but
for
only
a
limited
number
of
aliens,
for
a
limited
number
of
years.
the
second
possibility
was
the
house
bill
in
1939,
which
might
very
well
have
become
the
law
but
for
the
senate
compromise,
and
that
was
to
give
the
executive
the
power
to
suspend
deportations
temporarily,
and
ask
the
congress
for
legislation
to
cancel
those
deportations.
a
third
was
president
eisenhower's
proposals
in
1956
and
1957
to
give
to
the
attorney
general
this
final
authority
but
for
only
certain
classes
of
aliens,
such
as
clergymen
and
veterans.
and
a
fourth
was
what
the
congress
was
fully
prepared
to
do
prior
to
the
1940
act,
and
that
was
to
do
nothing
except
expect
compliance
with
mandatory
deportation
laws.
there
is
no
judicial
standing
by
which
the
court
may
now
determine
what
alternative
choice
to
make
for
the
congress.
mr.
michael
davidson
the
court
must
ask
two
questions.
one
is,
what
is
left?
is
that
fully
operative
as
law?
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
could
take
the
introductory
subsection
of
244
and
make
it
into
the
entire
section
as
a
full
and
final
grant
to
the
executive,
but
the
problem
with
that,
which
we
think
is
recognized
in
the
briefs
in
this
case,
is
that
that
section
begins
and
is
hereinafter
proscribed
and
incorporates
all
the
procedures
which
follow.
this
is
a
tightly
interwoven
section
which
either
must
be
accepted
or
rejected
as
a
whole.
without
being
able
to
make
any
individual
part
a
complete
statute
by
itself,
there
is
nothing
for
the
court
to
sever,
which
then
brings
the
court--
mr.
michael
davidson
--in
the
1952
act,
there
is
a
severability
clause
which
applies
to
the
vastness
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
and
quite
certainly
the
diverse
provisions
of
that
act,
which
include
quotas
for
immigration,
rules
for
naturalization,
procedures
of
all
kinds,
many
of
those
provisions
are
severable
from
each
other,
but
here,
in
this
one
section,
where
the
statutory
procedures
refer
quite
explicitly,
and
in
which
there
is
no
way
to
grant
the
final
relief
sought
here
unless
section
244(c)(2)
is
in
its
entirety
an
effective
provision,
then
the
court
may
not
do
what
only
the
congress
can
do,
which
is
to
make
the
second
choice,
what
powers
should
exist
if
these
powers
are
invalid.
i
think
this
brings
the
court
to
the
second
question,
and
it
is
one
that
is
briefed
by
both
sides.
if
it
is
impossible
to
sever
this
statute
without
being
unfaithful
to
the
intent
of
the
congress,
that
the
judgment
of
the
attorney
general
is
only
a
preliminary
judgment,
and
that
legal
effect
may
only
be
given
with
the
approval
of
the
congress,
then
the
court
must
decide,
is
there
any
basis
upon
which
it
can
give
relief
to
the
alien
respondent.
if
the
statute
is
inseverable,
then
the
entire
system
for
discretionary
relief
falls,
and
the
issue
goes
back
to
the
congress
to
decide
whether
it
should
be
replaced
at
all,
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
there
is
no
benefit
that
the
particular
individual
who
brought
this
proceeding
has
to
gain
from
the
court's
judgment.
the
respondents
argue
nonetheless
that
the
court
should
proceed
to
decide
the
issue,
that
the
court
has
never
decided
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
benefit
to
be
conferred
either
immediately
or
potentially
on
the
individual
who
invokes
the
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
davidson
this
court's
ordinary
approach
to
statutory
and
constitutional
matters
is
to
determine
statutory
issues
first,
in
order--
mr.
michael
davidson
--the
ultimate
question
is
of
the
court's
role,
and
particularly
of
the
court's
role
in
a
dispute
between
its
coordinate
branches.
if
a
ruling
on
severability
establishes
that
there
is
no
basis
for
granting
relief,
then
it
is
within
the
court's
tradition
not
to
reach
a
constitutional
issue
of
the
dimensions
presented
here.
mr.
michael
davidson
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
the
decision
in
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
because
that
court,
in
a
legislative
review
case,
decided
explicitly
that
it
should
reach
the
question
of
severability.
it
found
that
the
statute
was
non-severable,
and
that
it
should
therefore
not
render
an
advisory
opinion
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
davidson
we
have
cited
the
carter
company
coal
case,
in
which
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
wage...
of
price
control
provisions
under
the
nirra,
because
it
had
decided
that
those
provisions
fell
on
account
of
the
inseverability
of
the
statute.
the
only
cases
in
which
the
court
has
dealt
with
both
issues
is
when
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
the
structuring
of
its
opinions,
but
we
have
now
a
question
of
the
role
of
the
court.
it
is
very
important,
because
this
case
not
only
implicates
this
statute,
but
implicates
a
constellation
of
other
relationships
between
the
executive
and
legislative
branch,
from
war
powers
to
control
of
arms
sales,
budget,
rulemaking
throughout
the
national
government,
that
the
court
not
depart
from
traditional
rules
of
restraint
and
determine
whether
a
statutory
question
must
be
resolved
in
a
way
which
makes
the
constitutional
issue
unavoidable.
mr.
michael
davidson
let
me
address
those
quite
briefly.
mr.
chadha
does
have
two
other
grounds.
fortunately
for
mr.
chadha,
this
case
has
become
an
academic
matter.
he
has
married,
is
married
to
a
united
states
citizen.
he
has
been
married
since
august,
1980.
he
is
eligible
for
permanent
residence
on
that
basis.
additionally,
the
congress
in
the
refugee
act
of
1980
has
provided
a
system
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
may
have
concerned
the
immigration
judge,
and
there
are
now
a
whole
set
of
procedures
in
an
important
act
of
congress
to
deal
with--
mr.
michael
davidson
--no,
it
was
adopted
nine
months
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
davidson
his
marriage
was
in
august
of
1980.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
december
of
that
year.
mr.
michael
davidson
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
davidson
no.
no
one
informed
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
refugee
act
until
the
petition
for
rehearing.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
was
informed
of
the
marriage.
the
senate
and
the
house
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
brief
that
issue,
but
the
court
rendered
its
decision
before
receiving
briefs.
mr.
michael
davidson
no,
prior
to
it.
you
will
see
in
the
record
a
letter
from
the
house
and
senate
in
response
to
information
provided
by
mr.
chadha's
counsel
that
he
was
married,
that
this
was
an
important
issue
which
should
be
considered.
mr.
michael
davidson
this
case
does
not
require
the
court
to
anticipate
its
response
to
any
statute
which,
one,
goes
beyond
the
field
of
immigration
and
nationality,
and
two,
delegates
authority
to
anything
other
than
a
constitutional
unit
of
government,
an
entire
house.
i
think
it
is
important
in
this
and
many
other
respects
that
the
court
approach
this
case,
which
is
a
rather
singular
controversy,
in
the
most
narrow
manner
possible.
there
have
from
time
to
time
been
statutes
which
have
delegated
authority
to
committees.
they
are
not
in
very
much
use
now.
in
fact,
there
aren't
very
many
that
are
actually
in
force.
but
in
any
event,
they
pose
quite
distinct
problems.
in
establishing
this
system,
the
congress
was
attempting
to
maintain
the
essential
relationship
between
the
executive
and
its
houses
on
the
question
of
relief.
there
must
be
concurrence
by
the
executive
and
by
each
house
expressed
in
the
forms
of
this
statute
before
there
may
be
what
is
very
significant,
a
variation
from
the
otherwise
mandatory
effect
of
the
deportation
laws,
an
act
of
dispensation.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
intimate
at
all
what
the
result
would
be
if
there
were
to
be
a
further
delegation
to
a
subunit
of
congress.
mr.
michael
davidson
we
don't
think
the
constitution
should
be
read
as
a
contract
in
which
those
particular
methods
of
blending
power
are
thought
to
be
exclusive.
by
bicameral
agreement
and
presentation
to
four
presidents,
this
device
has
obtained
that
consensus
through
constitutional
means
necessary
to
establish
a
governmental
procedure,
and
we
think
that
those
are...
the
other
illustrations
are
illustrations
where
the
constitution
mandates
cooperation,
but
does
not
preclude
the
congress
and
the
president
from
agreeing
that
there
are
other
important
areas
which
should
be
resolved
through
related
mechanisms.
mr.
michael
davidson
the
senate's
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
key
issue
is
separation
of
powers.
the
question
that
should
be
asked
of
any
of
these
arrangements
is,
does
it
preserve
the
essential
balance.
mr.
michael
davidson
the
necessary
and
proper
clause--
mr.
michael
davidson
--the
necessary
and
proper
clause
must
be
exercised
consistent
with
the
limitations
of
the
constitution,
and
we
accept
as
a
major
limitation
adherence
to
the
separation
of
powers.
once
authority
is
delegated
in
a
way
which
changes
the
relationship
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
to
the
president,
there
may
be
questions
raised
for
this
court
that
are
not
presented
in
a
case
such
as
this.
another
factor
in
this
case
is
that
it
does
deal
with
authority
over
immigration,
an
area
which
the
court
has
historically
deferred
to
the
political
branches.
this
is
a
very
special
arrangement.
there
is
no
other
legislative
review
statute
that
concerns
individuals.
mr.
michael
davidson
i
would
have
you
defer
to
the
joint
decision
of
the
congress
and
the
four
presidents
to
whom
these
statutes
were
presented
and
approved.
mr.
michael
davidson
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
congress
and
the
president
may
amend
the
constitution,
but
when
the
question
is
separation
of
powers,
and
not
compliance
with
a
specific
provision
of
article
ii,
it
is
a
factor
that
none
of
the
presidents,
that
none
of
the
attorney
generals
who
advised
the
congress,
and
whose
opinions
were
sought
during
the
period
of
this
legislation,
in
any
way
intimated
that
any
function
of
the
executive
branch
would
be
disrupted
by
this
cooperative
arrangement.
mr.
michael
davidson
no,
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
congress
and
the
president
may
waive.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
what
it
thought
to
be
the
disruption
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
administration
of
the
immigration
act.
there
is
in
fact
no
record
of
disruption.
there
is
a
legal
argument
in
this
case.
there
is
the
experience
of
attorney
general
after
attorney
general
considering
this
matter,
with
the
responsibilities
he
has
over
the
immigration
service,
and
not
finding
that
this
provision
in
any
way
rendered
him
unable
or
less
able
to
fairly
administer
this
statute.
mr.
michael
davidson
these
bills
were
approved
by--
mr.
michael
davidson
--well,
more
than--
mr.
michael
davidson
--they
approved.
they
were
doing
this
at
a
time--
mr.
michael
davidson
--no,
i
won't
say
that.
mr.
michael
davidson
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
he
would
be
immediately
eligible
for
citizenship.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
deportation
should
be
cancelled.
the
statute
provides
no
means
for
retroactive
grant
of
permanent
residence.
it
provides
explicitly
that
permanent
residence
shall
be
recorded
upon
the
cancellation
of
deportation.
that
is
an
event
with
the
stay
of
the
mandate
that
is
yet
to
occur.
so
he
will
not
become
eligible
for
permanent
residence
until
there
is
a
mandate,
and
would
have
to
wait
three
years.
there
is
a
footnote,
not
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
court
thinks
that
permanent
residence
would
be
retroactive
to
some
earlier
time,
but
this
court
and
the
court
before
has
jurisdiction
to
review
a
deportation
order.
he
essentially
raises
a
naturalization
question,
and
a
question
which
would
require
the
court
to
read
some
other
term
into
the
statute,
because
as
the
statute
is
now
written,
his
permanent
residence
is
prospective
only.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
davidson
thank
you.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
o'connor,
in
response
to
your
question,
in
our
reply
brief
we
describe
the
incident
in
1940
in
which
the
congress
considered
legislation
to
deport
harry
bridges.
attorney
general
jackson
roundly
denounced
that
effort
as
totally
unprecedented
and
a
violation
of
all
cardinal
constitutional
principles,
and
the
congress
did
not
enact
that
legislation.
and
this
was
at
the
very
time
that
attorney
general
jackson
had
been
advising
the
president
that
he
may
sign
the
alien
registration
act
of
1940,
which
initiated
these
procedures
that
are
now
under
review.
last
term
i
stated
petitioner's
argument
why
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
because
of
the
inseverability
of
the
statute
or
vacated
because
of
the
availability
of
alternative
relief.
it
remains
our
conviction
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
decide
the
merits
of
legislative
review.
however,
it
is
also
the
view
of
the
senate
that
it
will
serve
the
public
interest
to
obtain,
in
an
appropriate
case
or
cases,
the
judgment
of
this
court
on
the
constitutionality
of
legislative
review
procedures.
to
that
end,
the
senate
yesterday
docketed
in
this
court
an
appeal
from
the
en
banc
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
federal
trade
commission
case.
the
statute
in
that
case
authorizes
the
congress
to
disapprove
trade
regulation
rules
of
the
federal
trade
commission
by
concurrent
resolutions
of
the
congress.
that
statute
is
severable
and
the
congress
in
the
federal
trade
commission
improvements
act
of
1980
established
a
special
procedure
to
obtain
judicial
review
and
the
judgment
of
this
court
on
its
constitutionality.
we
are
therefore
asking
in
that
case
that
the
court
reach
the
merits
and
decide
the
constitutional
questions
presented.
mr.
michael
davidson
that
is
correct,
and
because
it
is
not
severable
there
is
no
relief
which
may
be
provided
to
the
petitioner
and
the
issue
should
be
taken
up
in
a
case
in
which
effective
judicial
relief
under
article
iii
may
be
provided.
in
determining
whether
to
ask
the
court
to
resolve
the
disagreement
between
its
coordinate
branches
over
legislative
review,
petitioner
has
weighed
competing
considerations.
on
the
one
side
is
the
need
for
stability
in
the
structure
of
government
which
has
been
developed
in
recent
years
by
the
political
branches.
the
executive
paints
a
history
of
legislative
overreaching
and
we
have
described
a
history
of
executive
acquiescence
or
agreement.
but
in
fairness
and
in
some
detachment,
i
believe
we
can
all
step
back
and
agree
that
the
political
participants
have
joined
in
the
creation
of
these
contemporary
governmental
arrangements
and
share
responsibility
for
that.
although
the
branches
may
be
contending
for
relative
advantage
now,
the
ultimate
interest
is
that
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
a
whole
in
cautiously
approaching
the
devices
which
are
presently
used
to
mediate
political
powers
over
arms
sales,
budget
authority,
and
numbers
of
other
matters
to
which
legislative
review
has
been
applied.
these
procedures
serve
important
governmental
purposes
even
when
they
do
not
result
in
actual
disapproval,
because
they
establish
a
framework
for
consultation
and
agreement
between
the
political
branches.
it
is
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
that
the
senate
may
be
more
in
agreement
with
the
ninth
circuit
than
are
the
respondents.
that
court
saw
the
need
for
restraint
and
the
need
to
limit
its
decision
in
preference
to
a
precipitous
redistribution
of
present
political
power
and
responsibility.
the
need
for
caution
must
be
balanced,
however,
against
the
need
for
authoritative
constitutional
guidance.
the
congress
may
be
expected
to
turn
again
to
legislative
review
to
solve
new
problems,
and
it
is
critically
important
to
know
whether
such
resolutions
can
be
founded
securely
on
procedures
for
legislative
review
or
whether
the
congress
and
the
executive
should
look
to
other
ways
to
accommodate
their
differences.
therefore,
when
a
controversy
is
presented
in
which
the
severability
of
the
statute
or
the
lack
of
alternative
relief
makes
a
judgment
on
the
merits
appropriate,
the
senate
will
ask
the
court,
as
in
the
federal
trade
commission
case,
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue
on
appropriately
narrow
grounds.
on
the
merits
of
the
present
case,
the
claim
is
made
that
section
244
abridges
the
president's
role
in
the
legislative
process
and
his
responsibility
to
faithfully
execute
the
laws.
however,
the
history
of
the
statute
and
an
examination
of
its
text
shows
that
the
statute
preserves
the
balance
between
the
branches
while,
in
representative
celler's
words
in
1940,
"providing
a
humane
and
reasonable
solution
to
an
issue
over
which
the
congress
and
the
executive
have
been
at
impasse.
"
a
case
which
brings
into
question
the
process
of
legislation
must
begin
with
a
decision
made
through
that
process
to
limit
immigration.
but
from
the
outset
that
basic
legislative
decision
has
been
the
subject
of
stresses
resulting
from
the
openness
of
borders
and
the
nation's
hospitality
to
tourists
and
students
and
others.
mr.
michael
davidson
no,
but
what
is
being
asked
in
this
case
is
to
transmute
a
very
limited
effort
to
provide
relief
into
a
general
authority
on
the
part
of
the
executive
to
confer
amnesty
subject
to
no
review.
and
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
describe
to
the
court
the
nature
of
the
legislative
decision
that
was
made,
to
see--
mr.
michael
davidson
--oh,
it
bears
very
directly,
and
it
is
indeed
very
difficult
to
separate
the
severability
point
from
our
analysis
on
the
merits.
our
analysis
on
the
merits
is
to
demonstrate
that
this
particular
sharing
of
power...
and
it
is
a
sharing
of
power...
is
quite
unique
under
the
laws;
and
the
two
parts
of
it,
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
to
make
recommendations
and
the
power
of
the
congress
to
allow
an
alien
to
change
his
status
from
deportable
under
the
laws
to
lawful
permanent
residence,
are
integrally
related.
one
response
to
the
tensions
which
have
resulted
from
restrictions
on
immigration
has
been
the
periodic
consideration
of
amnesty,
and
from
time
to
time
the
congress
has
granted
discretion
to
the
executive
to
register
as
permanent
residents
aliens
who
had
entered
the
united
states
prior
to
statutorily
designated
dates,
and
we
are
now
at
a
critical
moment
in
the
consideration
by
the
congress
of
the
broadest
grant
of
amnesty
ever.
section
244
began
in
the
1930's
as
an
executive
request
to
the
congress
for
the
power
to
confer
amnesty.
the
proposal
encountered
all
the
problems
which
amnesty
proposals
have
since
encountered.
it
is
difficult
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
compelling
circumstances
of
individuals
and
the
strong
national
desire
to
enforce
the
legislative
decision
to
limit
immigration.
in
the
course
of
the
seven-year
debate
which
ensued,
the
congress
considered
but
could
not
obtain
agreement
on
various
of
the
alternatives
which
the
solicitor
general
has
properly
described
as
constitutional.
for
example,
the
solicitor
general
correctly
suggests
that
congressional
control
may
be
maintained
by
a
legislative
decision
to
limit
a
delegation
of
authority
to
a
specified
period
of
years.
the
house
bill
in
1937
would
have
done
that,
by
limiting
the
availability
of
relief
for
a
period
of
four
years.
but
that
proposal
failed
in
the
senate,
which
had
been
opposed
to
the
grant
of
any
discretion
to
the
executive
to
grant
permanent
residence
to
deportable
aliens.
or,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated
last
term,
the
statute
might
have
been
passed
to
authorize
the
executive
to
recommend
cancellations
of
deportations,
but
to
require
legislation
to
actually
cancel
those
deportations.
indeed,
the
house-passed
bill
in
1939
would
have
established
that
very
procedure.
but
the
administration
rejected
that
as
inadequate.
at
that
point
the
congress
could
have
determined
that
neither
bicameral
agreement
nor
agreement
with
the
executive
branch
to
a
relief
procedure
was
possible.
it
could
have
declared
that
it
had
done
its
constitutional
best
and
simply
let
the
affected
class
be
deported.
but
by
that
time
it
was
may
and
june
of
1940
and
an
alternative
to
deportation
in
time
of
a
world
at
war
was
deemed
essential.
the
congress
persisted
in
its
effort
to
resolve
the
seven-year
impasse
and
invoked
those
procedures
which
contribute
to
successful
political
resolutions.
first
the
congress
consulted
with
the
executive.
professor
mansfield
relates
in
a
contemporary
account
that
the
senate
judiciary
committee
substituted
a
labor
department
draft,
and
senator
connally
described
to
the
senate
how
the
judiciary
committee
had
called
on
the
department
of
justice
"and
had
the
solicitor
general
with
us.
"
i
cannot
say
what
attention
the
solicitor
general
paid
to
the
relief
provisions
of
the
alien
registration
act,
as
there
were
other
important
provisions.
but
that
act
is
not
lengthy,
and
senator
connally
further
stated,
"we
went
over
all
the
existing
laws
and
worked
the
new
provisions
into
existing
laws
so
as
to
make
a
harmonious
whole.
"
important
in
this
respect,
congress
incorporated
into
the
immigration
act
the
legislative
review
procedures
of
the
reorganization
act
of
1939,
which
presidents
continued
to
support
and
which
the
department
of
justice
has
supported
for
decades,
until
disowning
it
in
this
litigation.
and
then,
after
fashioning
this
statute
in
consultation
with
the
executive,
the
bill
received
bicameral
support
and
was
presented
formally
to
the
executive
for
the
approval
of
the
president,
which
it
received.
section
244
establishes
a
procedure
to
grant
permanent
residence.
it
is
not
a
deportation
statute.
the
only
status
which
may
be
changed
by
section
244
is
from
deportability
to
lawful
permanent
residence.
under
these
arrangements,
the
legal
authority
for
the
attorney
general
to
record
the
permanent
residence
of
a
deportable
alien
derives
from
the
act,
which
had
been
approved
through
the
process
of
bicameral
agreement
and
presentation.
the
procedures
of
section
244
preserve
the
balance
among
the
three
participants
in
the
legislative
process,
the
two
houses
and
the
executive.
each
must
concur
in
the
form
established
by
the
statute
for
there
to
be
a
change
in
the
legal
status
of
an
alien
from
deportable
to
lawful
resident.
mr.
michael
davidson
the
executive
precedes
it.
this
is
an
arrangement
which
changes
the
order
of
decision
but
preserves
the
role
of
each
branch.
the
legal
status
of
a
deportable
alien
may
not
be
changed
unless
the
executive
initiates
the
request
to
the
congress
and
unless
the
two
houses,
through
the
mode
of
acquiescence
or,
in
the
case
of
criminal
aliens,
through
a
positive
resolution
of
approval,
concur.
and
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
in
1939
and
'40,
which
was
to
take
the
burden
from
the
alien
of
initiating
private
relief
procedures
by
finding
a
member
who
would
introduce
a
bill
and
conferring
that
burden
on
first
the
department
of
labor
and
then
the
attorney
general
to
screen,
to
recommend,
while
leaving
effective
control
in
the
congress
to
determine
whether
the
law
may
be
suspended.
and
that's
a
significant
element
of
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
the
creation
of
new
rights
through
the
process
of
resolution.
we
are
talking
about
the
suspension
of
existing
mandates
of
the
congress
to
deport
individuals
who
meet
certain
standards
or
who
fail
to
meet
them.
and
in
order
to
give
that
individual
a
new
status,
the
status
of
a
permanent
resident
with
eligibility
for
citizenship,
it
was
determined
fundamentally
important
that
all
participants
in
the
legislative
process
take
part,
even
though
the
order
of
consideration
would
change,
the
initiative
would
come
from
the
executive
and
consideration
then
be
had
by
the
congress.
the
concurrence
by
the
congress
in
the
grant
of
permanent
residence
to
a
deportable
alien
only
confirms
the
view
of
the
executive
that
permanent
residence
should
be
granted,
and
is
of
course
totally
beneficial
to
the
aliens
whose
status
is
changed.
and
therefore,
even
if
questions
may
be
asked
about
legislative
review
in
other
contexts,
there
is
no
one
before
the
court
who
may
claim
to
be
injured
by
the
procedures
for
granting
permanent
residence
through
section
244.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
davidson
to
reiterate
a
point
of
the
last
argument,
the
question
of
severability
in
this
case
is
very
much
a
question
of
separation
of
powers
also.
the
entire
history
of
this
effort
to
reach
accommodations
between
the
two
branches
from
the
1930's
on
has
involved
at
critical
points
requests
by
the
executive
for
new
and
enhanced
authority,
which
as
this
history
demonstrates
often
would
not
have
been
granted
without--
mr.
michael
davidson
--it
would
in
any
case
have
to
recapture
that
power
over
the
veto
of
the
president.
our
point
is
it
should
return,
if
at
all,
to
the
status
quo
ante
and
establish
a
new
basis
for
shared
power
after
that.
