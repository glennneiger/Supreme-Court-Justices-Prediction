mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
any
attempt
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
veto
faces,
i
submit,
an
insoluble
dilemma.
the
reason
is
that
there
are
two
separate
constitutional
demands
that
that
device
has
to
satisfy.
they
are,
first,
the
twin
requirements
for
lawmaking
specified
in
article
i
of
the
constitution,
passage
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
presentation
to
the
president,
and
the
second
is
separation
of
powers.
and
now
the
dilemma.
any
attempt
to
explain
a
legislative
veto
in
such
a
way
as
to
blunt
the
separation
of
powers
problems,
that
this
is
not
really
enforcement
of
the
law,
or
this
is
not
really
interpretation
of
the
law,
only
serves
to
highlight
the
fact
that
whatever
else
may
be
involved,
the
congress
is
clearly
exercising
legislative
power,
making
new
law,
and
is
doing
so
by
one
house
of
congress
and
without
participation
by
the
president.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
the
most
fundamental
underpinning
of
article
i
and
it
is
also
the
most
fundamental
underpinning
of
the...
of
the
framers'
intention.
if
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
constitutional
history,
it
is,
number
one,
that
they
were
concerned
above
all,
as
this
court
observed
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
about
an
overweening
congress,
and
number
two,
that
the
two
protections
that
they
built
into
the
constitution
against
that
very
eventuality
was,
number
one,
bicamerality,
if
there
is
such
a
word,
the
requirement
of
two
houses
of
congress,
and
number
two,
the
presidential
veto.
in
an
understandable
attempt
by
the
house
and
senate
to
focus
this
court's
attention
on
the
separation
of
powers
issue
on
that
issue
alone,
and
i
will
deal
with
that
in
just
a
moment,
the
house
and
senate
stressed
the
fact
that
this
is
legislation.
the
house
brief
asserts,
for
example,
that
congress
is
here
executing
its
own
vested
legislative
powers,
and
with
that
statement
i
agree.
it
is
only
part
of
the
case,
but
it
is
a
correct
statement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
he
is
not.
this
court
held
in
buckley
versus
valeo
that
rulemaking
was
an
executive
power.
a
fortiori,
in
my
view,
adjudication
of
this
kind
is
an
executive
power,
carrying
out
the
intent
of
the...
or
carrying
out
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
dilemma
that
the
house
faces
is
not
that...
we
do
not
face
the
same
dilemma
that
the
house
faces
for
this
reason.
they
are
two
separate
constitutional
hurdles,
and
you
have
to
get
over
both
of
them.
and
any...
as
i
say,
any
attempt
to
highlight...
or
to
downplay
the
separation
of
powers
clause
does
highlight
the
presentment
and
bicameral
requirements.
the
same
is
simply
not
true
insofar
as
the
executive's
position
is
concerned,
because
we
contend
that
this
is...
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
call
it,
and
this
is
one
instance
in
which
labels
clearly
can
become
an
enemy
of
analysis,
that
whatever
else
it
is,
it
is
a
violation
of
article
i,
section
1,
for
this
reason.
maybe
mr.
gressman
is
right,
maybe
mr.
gressman
is
not
right
when
he
says
that
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
exercising
legislative
power.
it
doesn't
matter,
for
this
reason.
there
are
certain
instances
in
which
the
constitution
authorizes
congress
to
take
action
other
than
by
legislating,
such
as
proposal
of
constitutional
amendments,
treaty
ratification,
confirmation,
and
disciplining
of
members,
and
there
are
some
others,
but
not
even
the
best
friends
of
the
legislative
veto
contend
that
that
device
falls
into
any
one
of
those
categories.
all
right.
so
that
aside
from
those
categories,
the
only
way
that
congress
can
act
is
by
legislation.
if
section
244(c)(2),
then,
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
is
not
legislation,
then
congress
lacks
the
constitutional
power
to
do
it.
and
if
it
is
legislation,
then
the
bicameralism
and
the
presentation
requirements
must
be
met.
for
that
reason,
you
don't
need
to
characterize
it
as
either
legislation
or
not
legislation,
because
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
it
is
something
that
congress
has
attempted
to
do.
if
it
is
legislation,
then
bicameralism
and
presentation
must
be
complied
with.
if
it
is
not
legislation,
then
congress
lacks
the
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely.
the
two
houses--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--same
result.
same
result.
it
satisfies
the
bicameralism
requirement.
it
does
not
satisfy
the
presentation
requirement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
a
very
easy
question,
or
very
easy
argument
to
answer,
and
it
is
simply
that
the
house
and
senate
by
two-thirds
vote
at
least,
as
i
read
the
constitution
as
i
came
into
court
this
morning,
cannot
amend
the
constitution.
this
one
was
in
fact
passed
over
president
truman's
veto,
but
that
is
immaterial.
neither
the
house
and
senate
acting
together
with
the
president
nor
the
house
and
senate
by
two-thirds
vote
have
the
power
to
eliminate
the
very
clear
requirements
in
article
i,
section
1
of
the
constitution
that
legislative
power
means...
that
legislative
power
means
power
that
is
to
be
exercised
by
two
houses,
and
the
requirement
in
article
i,
section
7,
that
any
exercise
of
legislative
power
must
be
presented
to
the
president,
and
that
is
the
defect
also
with
the...
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
won't--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
sir.
it
then
becomes
execution
of
the
laws,
in
my
view,
justice
stevens,
and
that,
i
think,
follows
naturally
from
both
this
court's
decisions
of
a
half-century
ago
and
also
even
more
so
buckley
versus
valeo.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
not
violate,
in
my
view--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
right.
so
long
as
it
is
not
a
congressional...
that
gets
you
into
the
buckley
versus
valeo
appointments
problem.
then
it
would
be
constitutional.
and
parenthetically,
let
me
mention
that
if,
as
this
court
held
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
congress
may
not
constitutionally
appoint
officers
of
the
united
states,
a
fortiori,
they
may
not
perform
the
executive
function
themselves
by
stepping
in
and
in
effect
appointing
themselves.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely.
i
would
think
it's
really
a
fortiori.
i
think
it
is
the
same
case.
similarly,
the
petitioners'
arguments
with
respect
to
congress's
power
over
aliens
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
simply
will
not
wash
under
the
constitutional
provisions
of
article
i,
section
1
and--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no
problem.
no
problem.
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
because
it
gives
to
congress
the
opportunity
to
pass...
to
exercise
its
legislative
powers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you
can
make
an
argument
that
that
is
a
violation
of
separation
of
powers.
i
think
that
given
this
court's
decision
in
sibbach
versus
wilson,
it
wouldn't
be
a
very
strong
argument,
and
we
are
not
pursuing
it
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
same
result.
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
constitutional.
if
he
is
just
making
the
recommendation,
and
absent
any...
absent
any--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--for
suspension,
but
it
is
only
a
recommendation,
and
if
congress
does
nothing,
it
is
not
sustained.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
what
if
congress
doesn't,
under
your
hypothetical--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
i
just
want
to
test
your
example.
0
[generallaughter.]
if
congress
does
nothing,
then
does
it
become...
did
i
misunderstand?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
i
have
to
know,
justice
white,
is
what
happens
in
the
event
that
neither
house
does
anything,
what
happens
to
that
recommendation?
does
the
deportation
get
suspended
or
not?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
then
it
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
let
me
return--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right,
okay.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do
not
agree
that
it
is
relatively
the
same
insofar
as
separation
of
powers
is
concerned,
for
this
reason.
before,
all
that
the
attorney
general
could
do
was
to
make
recommendations,
and
then
congress
would
consider
it.
now,
effectively,
what
congress
has
done
insofar
as
separation
of
powers
is
concerned
is
to
say,
we
passed
this
1952
nationality
and
immigration
act.
it
is
a
massively
complex
statute.
over
every
provision
except
for
two,
the
enforcement
is
going
to
be
vested
in
the
attorney
general.
but
as
to
two
provisions,
and
one
of
them
is
this
244(c)(2),
we
are
going
to
wait
and
see
how
it
is
that
the
executive
decides
to
enforce
the
statute,
and
then,
in
the
event
that
we
decide
we
don't
like
the
way
the
executive
enforces
the
statute,
then
we
will
do
the
job
ourselves.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
but
as
the
house
itself
says
in
its
brief,
congress
has
withheld
from
the
executive
some
part
of
the
functions
of
executing
the
whole
of
the
statute,
and
we
agree
completely
that
that
is
exactly
what
congress
has
done,
and
that
is
exactly
what
congress--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
relatively
the
same
position
if
all
the
constitution
was
talking
about
was
the
matter
of
the
total
package
of
power
on
the
president's
side
and
the
total
package
of
power
on
the
congress's
side.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
with
respect
to
suspension.
but
the
constitution
also
requires
more.
number
one,
there
is
also
an
article
i
of
the
constitution,
and
number
two,
the
constitution
does
address
in
what
respect
those
powers
are
in
fact
exercised
vis-a-vis
the
other
branch.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
it
is
really
not...
that
it
is
one
of
the
less
important
severability
issues,
less
serious
severability
issues
that
this
court
has--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
we
take
exactly
the
same
position
that
was
implied
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
davidson.
it
shouldn't
be
reached
here.
and
let
me
fill
that
out
just
a
bit
and
give
you
a
few
of
the
cases
that
you
were
asking
mr.
davidson
about.
we
have
examined,
justice
rehnquist,
the
cases
that
we
can
find,
and
i
do
not
represent
that
it
was
exhaustive,
but
it
was
as
exhaustive
as
we
could
make
it.
i
do
not
know
of
any
single
case...
we
found
about
25
of
them...
i
do
not
know
of
any
single
case,
and
certainly
carter
versus
carter
coal
is
not
one
of
them,
in
which
this
court
has
ever
considered
the
issue
of
severability
prior
to
the
issue
on
the
merits.
now,
in
fairness,
i
must
say
that
there
is
never
any
case
in
which
the
issue
was
exactly
as
mr.
davidson
has
argued,
and
i
understand
what
his
argument
is,
but
i
will
also
say
that
i
agree
completely
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
simply
no
reason
even
to
reach
the
severability
issue
unless
and
until
you
first
reach
the
issue
on
the
merits.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
it
is
not
severable,
for
these
reasons.
mr.
morrison
will
develop
this
in
more
detail,
because
it
pertains
more
to
his
client,
but
in
the
first
place,
severability
is
merely
an
aspect
of
the
more
general
and
the
broader
constitutional
principle
that
the
function
of
the
court
is
to
save
rather
than
to
destroy.
now,
using
mr.
davidson's
own
characterization
in
that
respect,
that
the
question
is
whether
the
balance
could
stand
if
we
took
out
this
particular
provision,
it
can
stand
very,
very
well.
you
take
out
244(c)(2)
and
just
put
them
out
of
the
statute.
the
rest
of
it
functions
very
nicely.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
that
is
saying
is,
of
course,
exactly
what
my
opponents...
this
is
a
major
theme
in
their
briefs,
that
there
are
some
practical
reasons
that
the
legislative
veto
has
something
to
say
for
it,
and
my
answer,
of
course,
to
that
is,
whatever
those
practical
reasons
may
be,
they
have
to
yield
to
the
examination
of
the
principles--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--if
the
court
will
agree
with
me
on
the
second
proposition,
that
it
should
not
reach...
our
preferred
approach
would
be
never
to
reach
the
severability
issue,
but
in
response
to
the
question,
how
should
you
rule
if
you
do,
i
am
simply
responding
to
that
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
of
course.
if
you
decide
the
merits,
then
you
have
to
reach
the
severability
issue.
it
is
excisable.
there
is
the
general
strong
presumption
that
you
save
rather
than
destroy.
in
this
particular
instance
congress
said,
we
want
as
much
saved
as
possibly
can
be
saved,
because
there
is
a
severability
clause,
and
perhaps
strongest
of
all,
if
our
view
prevails,
that
is,
that
the
statute...
that
this
particular
provision
is
severable,
then
the
net
result
is
going
to
be
the
same
as
has
occurred
over
the
42
years
of
this
statute's
history,
in
over
96
percent
of
the
cases,
whereas
if
the
statute
is
not
severable,
then
the
result
is
going
to
be
the
same
as
it
has
been
in
less
than
4
percent
of
the
cases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
we
don't
do
anything
at
all,
there
will
be
no
suspension.
that
one
is
constitutional.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
is
the
same
basic
analysis.
the
constitutional
defect
is
when
congress
attempts
to
pick
a
foil,
if
you
will,
some
funnel,
some
laundromat
through
which
they
can
run
a
policy
decision
and
then
have
that
policy
decision
reflect
back
before
them
so
that
they
can
make
the
policy
choice
absent
compliance
with
bicameral...
with
the
two
house
and
presentation
requirements.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
see,
i
am...
if...
i
am
not
certain
which
was
the
evidence
and
which
was
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
if
congress
simply
changes
by
legislation,
that
is,
by
going...
by
running
the
matter
by
passage,
the
changes
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
presentation
to
the
president,
then
it
is
constitutional.
if
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
everything
has
to
be
varied
only
by
one
house
of
congress
or
by
both
houses
of
congress,
then
it
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
is
also
the
basic
defect
with
my
opponents'
reliance
on
the
congressional
power
over
aliens,
or
their
asserted
congressional
power
over
aliens,
and
also
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
gressman
referred,
for
example,
to
congress's
vast
power
over
aliens.
that
is
simply
just
a
wrong
statement.
it
is
not
a
congressional
power
over
aliens.
it
is
a
power
to
make
laws
dealing
with
aliens,
and
in
order
to
bring
that
power
into
existence,
the
constitutional
prerequisites
for
lawmaking
must
be
observed.
the
same
deficiency
applies
to
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh.
mr.
morrison
will
deal
more
completely
with
that,
because
it
is
his
client.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
the
short
answer,
justice
brennan,
is
that
it
makes
a
very
great
difference
to
him,
because
he
becomes
a
citizen
about
two
years
earlier
if
this
court
affirms
the
court
of
appeals
than
if
he
has
to
go
through
the
other
procedures.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
has
this
bearing,
that
he
clearly
does
have
standing
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue,
because
he
is
one
who
is
aggrieved
by
what
the...
by
what
the
house--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
it
certainly
can
be
done
on
prudential--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
i
don't
know...
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
this
court,
faced
with
the
kind
of
detriment,
actual
detriment
that
mr.
chadha
faces,
would...
has
declined
to
consider
a
constitutional
issue
such
as
the
one
that
mr.
chadha...
that
mr.
chadha
raises,
because
while
it
may
be
true
that
he
now
has
a
way
around
deportability,
certainly
citizenship
is
a
very
important
interest,
and
citizenship...
citizenship
sooner
is
a
much
greater
advantage
than
citizenship
later.
if
mr.
gressman
were
correct
that
the
only
test
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
was
whether
there
were
this
fit
between
means
and
end,
it
would
repeal
article
i,
section
7.
article
i,
section
7,
does
not
say
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
anything
that
it
deems
to
be
necessary
and
proper.
article
i,
section
7,
says...
or
article
i,
section
8,
says
that
congress
has
the
power
to
make
all
laws
which
may
be
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
to
execution
the
foregoing
power.
there
is
no
defect
more
fundamental
to
my
opponents'
case
than
simply
the
fact
that
they
have
completely
ignored
article
i
of
the
constitution,
the
requirement
in
section
1
of
bicameral
passage,
and
in
section
7
of
presentation
to
the
president,
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
helps
them
not
at
all,
because
it
gives
them
only
the
power
to
enact
laws.
i
simply
close
where
i
started,
that
there
was
no
concern
manifest
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution
any
greater
than
that
that
was
expressed
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
to
protect
the
other
branches
of
the
government
against
an
overweaning
congress.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
will
take
the
hardest
case
there.
where
it
is
a
two-house
veto,
it
is
still
unconstitutional,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
fails
of
presentment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
the
hardest
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
unconstitutional,
because
that
is
an
instance
where,
even
though
it
is
just
as
good
to
do
it
that
other
way,
do
it
a
way
other
than
the
constitution
prescribes--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
in
order
to
be...
in
order
to
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
and
in
order
to
be
faithful
to
my
oath
of
office,
faithfully
to
carry
out
the
laws
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
i
would
have
to
take
that
position.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
justice
rehnquist,
there
might
be
serious
severability
questions.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
power
to
legislate
is
the
power
to
make
law,
to
change
people's
rights
and
obligations.
it
is
the
most
important
power
of
government
and
in
the
view
of
those
who
wrote
the
constitution
it
has
the
greatest
potential
for
abuse.
the
constitution
is
unusually
explicit
concerning
how
this
legislating
power,
this
power
to
make
laws,
is
to
be
accomplished:
either
passage
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
presentation
to
the
president
for
his
approval
or,
in
the
event
of
veto
by
the
president,
passage
by
two-thirds
of
both
houses
of
congress
over
his
veto.
in
recent
times
congress
has
invented
a
device
which
circumvents
these
basic
constitutional
requirements,
eliminates
the
president
from
his
constitutionally
guaranteed
participation
in
the
lawmaking
process,
and
switches
the
authority
to
legislate,
to
make
changes
in
the
legal
rights
and
obligations
that
people
would
otherwise
have,
to
congress
acting
alone
by
majority
vote
or
to
a
single
house
or
committee
of
congress.
the
legislative
veto
in
this
case
suffers
from
the
same
defect
as
the
legislative
veto
in
any
other
case.
whatever
labels
one
may
choose
to
attach
to
it,
no
label
can
obscure
the
fact
that
a
legislative
veto
is
something
that
congress
does.
it
is
an
official
governmental
act
by
congress.
if
it
is
not
legislative,
if
it
is,
as
mr.
gressman
said,
non-legislation,
then
congress
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
it,
because
as
this
court
made
clear
in
buckley
versus
valeo
and
springer
versus
philippine
islands,
the
legislative
power
is
the
power
to
make
laws.
and
if
it
is
legislative
in
character,
then
it
must
comply
with
the
constitutional
prerequisites
for
legislation,
passage
by
two
houses
and
approval
by
the
president.
whether
it's
a
legislative
no
or
a
legislative
yes
is
beside
the
point.
congress
has
in
any
event
made
law.
it
has
affected
people's
rights.
absent
what
the
house
did
to
mr.
chadha
in
this
case,
his
status
would
have
been
adjusted
from
deportability
to
a
lawful
permanent
residence,
a
very
important
change,
and
today
he
would
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
it
is
true,
as
mr.
davidson
says,
that
he
had
no
right
to
have
the
attorney
general
change
his
status
prior
to
enactment
of
the
original
legislation,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
but
that
legislation
made
law,
made
it
in
the
proper
way,
two-thirds
passage
over
president
truman's
veto.
that
statute
gave
to
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
make
law
as
to
mr.
chadha
and
others
like
him,
and
from
that
point
forward
he
did
have
the
right
to
have
the
dispensation
that
the
attorney
general
gave
to
mr.
chadha
and
others
like
him
in
this
particular
case.
in
those
few
instances
in
which
the
constitution
authorizes
congress
to
act
other
than
through
legislation,
the
textual
authorization
is
explicit
and
narrow.
examples
are
treaty
ratification
and
appointment
confirmation
by
the
senate
and
the
proposal
of
constitutional
amendments.
when
the
framers
intended
to
authorize
exceptions,
they
knew
how
to
do
so
and
they
did
so
in
narrow
and
explicit
terms.
other
than
those
exceptions,
the
authority
granted
to
congress
is,
as
this
court
said
in
buckley
and
springer,
the
authority
to
make
laws.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
difference
is,
justice
rehnquist,
of
course
that
the
constitution
is
explicit
on
this
one
point,
and
that
is
that
if
congress
is
to
act
other
than
in
a
non-legislative
fashion,
such
as
dealing
with
adjournment,
ratification
of
treaties
and
so
forth,
it
must
present
its
work
product
to
the
president
for
his
approval.
on
one
day
the
framers
passed
clause
2
of
article
i,
section
7,
in
which
they
said
that
all
bills
must
be
presented
to
the
president,
and
then
in
explicit
fear
that
congress
might
be
able
to
act
to
affect
people's
rights
other
than
by
a
bill,
they
added
the
next
day
clause
3
of
article
i,
section
7,
which
expanded
that
to
all
orders,
votes
and
resolutions.
the
senate
also
suggests
that
the
legislation
requirement
was
met
in
this
case
by
the
original
legislation
when
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
first
became
law
in
1952.
this
is
nothing
less
than
an
invitation
to
rewrite
the
constitution
in
its
most
fundamental
respect.
it
would
mean
that
congress,
acting
all
by
itself
by
a
two-thirds
vote,
could
remove
both
the
bicameralism
and
the
presentation
requirements
from
all
future
lawmaking
efforts.
and
in
fact,
this
case
involves
nothing
less
than
that
issue.
if
one
house
of
congress
can
lawfully
change
the
otherwise
applicable
law
establishing
mr.
chadha's
rights
as
it
did
in
this
case,
then
i
know
of
no
intellectually
defensible
way
to
distinguish
a
statute
in
which
congress
makes
every
action,
rulemaking
or
adjudication,
by
every
department
or
administrative
agency
in
the
government
subject
to
veto
by
one
or
both
houses
or
even
one
committee.
the
president
would
surely
veto
the
original
scheme,
but
by
a
two-thirds
vote
overriding
that
veto
congress
could
eliminate
the
president's
constitutionally
vested
power
to
participate
in
lawmaking
and
thereby
bring
to
pass
the
very
result
that
was
the
framers'
most
deeply
held
separation
of
powers
concern.
and
from
that
point
on
congress
would
be
home
free
with
a
new
power
not
recognized
in
the
constitution,
and
all
that
it
took
to
bring
that
about
is
a
two-thirds
vote
by
congress
itself.
mr.
gressman
refers
again
to
the
unique
sovereign
power
vested
exclusively
in
congress
to
deal
with
aliens.
the
constitution
does
in
fact
grant
broad
power
over
matters
of
alienage,
but
it
is
not
a
power
that
belongs
to
congress
alone.
when
this
court
ruled
in
our
favor
in
the
placencia
case
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
it
was
dealing
with
a
statute
that
was
enacted
by
the
legislative
process:
both
houses
of
congress
with
the
approval
of
the
president.
the
power
to
deal
with
aliens
is
a
power,
therefore,
that
belongs
to
a
majority
of
both
houses
with
the
concurrence
of
the
president
or
to
a
two-thirds
majority
of
both
houses
acting
together,
following
the
president's
disapproval.
and
for
the
same
reason,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
gives
by
its
own
terms
the
power
to
make
all
laws
which
shall
be
necessary
and
proper.
we
deal
here
with
constitutional
commands
which
are
unusually
explicit
and
concerning
whose
purposes
the
framers
left
no
doubt.
no.
73
of
the
federalist
papers
referred
to
the
propensity
of
the
legislative
department
to
intrude
upon
and
absorb
the
powers
of
the
other
departments.
and
this
court
in
buckley
versus
valeo
observed,
quoting
from...
excuse
me...
observed
that
the
debates
of
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
federalist
papers
are
replete
with
expressions
of
fear
that
the
legislative
branch
of
the
national
government
will
aggrandize
itself
at
the
expense
of
the
other
two
branches.
that
is
a
correct
statement.
anyone
who
reads
those
debates
and
the
federalist
papers
comes
away
with
the
unmistakable
conclusion
that
there
was
no
concern
that
more
dominated
the
debates
of
that
summer
of
1787
and
the
period
of
passage
and
ratification
between
1787
and
1789
than
that
which
justice
white
characterized
in
his
separate
opinion
in
buckley
versus
valeo
as
an
overweening
congress.
and
it
is
equally
clear
what
the
framers
did
in
response
to
that
concern,
that
with
specific
regard
to
that
very
concern
they
built
into
the
constitution
two
requirements:
the
first,
that
laws
be
passed
by
two
separate
houses
of
congress;
and
second,
that
any
congressional
attempt
to
make
law,
to
change
people's
rights
and
obligations,
must
be
presented
to
the
president.
let
me
say
just
a
brief
word
about
separation
of
powers.
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
is
a
massively
complex
act,
with
literally
hundreds
of
provisions.
congress
assigned
the
responsibility
of
carrying
out
most
of
those
provisions
to
the
attorney
general.
but
in
the
case
of
section
244(c)(2)
it
assigned
the
enforcement
job
to
itself,
acting
through
either
house.
the
fact
that
congressional
law
enforcement
occurs
only
after
executive
enforcement,
and
then
only
in
the
event
that
either
house
disagrees
with
the
executive,
helps
not
at
all.
it
lies
outside
the
power
of
congress
to
say,
we
will
wait
and
see
how
you
execute
this
law
we
have
passed
and
if
we
don't
like
the
way
you
have
done
it
we
will
take
over
the
job
ourselves.
congress
has
also
squarely
usurped
the
judicial
function.
in
this
very
case,
congressman
eilberg
explained
the
reason
for
this
particular
veto.
it
was
that
chadha
and
five
others
"did
not
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
"
plain
performance
of
a
plain
judicial
function.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
do.
in
this
particular
instance
it
was
a
clear
exercise
of
the
judicial
power.
congressman
eilberg
explained
the
reason
that
congress
should
take
the
particular
position
that
it
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
well
settled
and
has
never
been
a
matter
of
dispute
that
the
attorney
general
initially
has
the
authority
in
implementation
of
the
statute
to
make
the
determination
that
he
makes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that
is
an
executive
determination.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
it
was
congress
itself
rather
clearly
that
said,
we
conclude
that
he
did
not
comply
with
the
judicial
standards...
or
excuse
me,
did
not
comply
with
the
statutory
standards.
now,
if
that
were
the
case
that's
an
issue
that
should
have
been
raised
in
court,
either
by
mr.
chadha
in
the
event
that
he
contended...
if
it
had
gone
the
other
way
it
could
have
been
raised
in
court
by
mr.
chadha.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
for
that
reason
congress
in
effect
stepped
in
and
in
effect
appealed
from
that
determination,
and
necessarily
exercised
a
judicial
power.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
an...
it
is
an
interference
with
the
executive
power
by
exercising
a
judicial
power,
which
was
to
interpret
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
he
does
exercise
something
like
judicial
authority.
he
exercises
a
conglomerate
of
authority
that
is
necessary
to
his
implementation
of
the
statute
and
that
necessarily
also
includes--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
know
of
few
instances
of
either
adjudication
or
rulemaking,
particularly
rulemaking,
that
do
not
require
some
exercise
of
a
judicial
type
power.
finally,
notwithstanding
the
framers'
concerns
and
the
unusual
precision
with
which
they
required
not
only
passage
by
two
houses,
but
also
that
all
bills,
orders,
votes
be
presented
to
the
president,
the
house
and
the
senate
consistently
suggest
that
legislative
vetoes
ought
to
be
sustained
because
our
system
needs
them.
they
are,
we
are
told,
hybrids
that
work.
parenthetically,
it
would
appear
from
the
only
empirical
study
on
the
subject
and
from
the
experience
of
the
american
bar
association
that
that
premise
is
in
fact
lacking.
but
the
real
defect
is
that
whether
correct
or
incorrect
the
argument
is
irrelevant.
constitutional
defects
cannot
be
cured
by
practical
expediency.
in
this
case
and
two
others
now
pending
on
petitions
for
certiorari
and
appeals
before
this
court,
eleven
members
of
two
separate
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
concluded
that
the
constitution
means
what
it
says.
those
eleven
judges
were
correct
and
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
