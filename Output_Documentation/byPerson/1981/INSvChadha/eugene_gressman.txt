mr.
eugene
gressman
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
something
of
an
historic
occasion.
never
before
have
the
two
houses
of
congress
been
forced
to
intervene
as
litigating
parties
before
this
court.
they
have
been
forced
to
intervene
to
protest
another
episode
in
the...
what
this
court
once
described
as
the
tug
of
war
between
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
of
government.
the
house
of
representatives,
which
i
represent
here,
views
this
attack
upon
the
legislative
powers
of
congress
as
directed
primarily
at
the
historic,
necessary,
and
proper
power
of
the
congress
to
enact
legislation
which
it
deems
appropriate
and
necessary
in
execution
of
its
vested
legislative
powers.
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
proper
place
for
starting
the
constitutional
analysis
of
the
validity
of
section
244(c)(2)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
but
before
we
get
to
that
analysis,
we
must
understand
that,
as
i
stated
before,
while
the
assault
here
comes
upon
that
particular
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
this
is
but
one
episode
in
the
far-flung,
orchestrated
war
declared
by
the
executive
branch
against
the
device
that
is
popularly
and
often
inaccurately
known
as
the
legislative
veto.
in
case
after
case
where
private
parties
seek
to
raise
this
constitutional
attack
upon
the
so-called
legislative
veto,
the
executive
branch
immediately
drops
all
opposition
and
concedes
that
the
veto
provision
is
indeed
unconstitutional.
that
has
forced
the
two
houses
of
congress
to
become
litigating
parties,
which
is
not
their
basic
function,
but
we
have
been
forced
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one
in
the
executive
department
that
sees
fit
to
defend
or
state
the
case
for
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions.
now,
that
very
fact,
as
in
this
case,
gives
rise
to
a
tremendous
number
of
severe
problems,
threshold
problems
about
whether
or
not
that
is
a
case
or
controversy,
or
whether
there
are
other
reasons
why
such
a
momentous
constitutional
question
should
be
addressed
under
the
circumstances
in
which
this
case
arises.
we
have
in
this
case
alone
critical
problems
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lower
court
to
consider
this
constitutional
question.
we
have
problems
of
justiciability.
we
have
problems
about
the
standing
of
mr.
chadha
to
institute
this
kind
of
constitutional
challenge
based
not
on
his
personal
claims
or
rights
but
upon
the
executive's
claims
with
respect
to
the
legislative
veto.
we
have
a
severe
problem
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
any
adverse
parties
in
the
court
below,
and
there
are
other
prudential
considerations,
to
say
nothing
of
a
critical
severability
problem
which
may
preclude
resolving
the
constitutional
question,
a
matter
which
my
colleague,
the
senate
legal
counsel,
will
address.
to
take
but
one
brief
look
at
the
technical
appeal
problem
that
is
before
this
court
in
number
80-1832,
where
the
government
has
sought
to
take
an
appeal
to
this
court
under
section
1252
as
a
non-aggrieved
party.
i
will
not
add
anything
to
what
has
been
said
in
our
written
briefs
on
this
subject,
except
to
call
attention
to
the
court's
procuring
of
a
ruling
one
month
ago,
on
january
11th,
in
donovan
against
richmond
county
association,
which
i
suggest
makes
even
more
severe
the
government's
problem
in
trying
to
take
an
appeal
to
this
court
under
section
1252.
but
to
get
back
to
the
other
issues
in
this
case,
i
suggest
that
the
key
to
understanding
all
these
threshold
problems
as
well
as
the
basic
constitutional
question,
lies
in
an
appreciation
of
the
actual
meaning
and
scope
of
the
statutory
scheme
issue,
to
wit,
section
244
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
now,
the
executive
and
mr.
chadha
would
begin
and
end
their
constitutional
analysis
by
referring
to
the
two
constitutional
objections
that
are
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
all
this
litigation
respecting
the
so-called
legislative
veto.
that
is
an
objection
based
upon
the
presentment
clause,
article
i,
section
7
of
the
constitution,
which
typifies
the
bicameral
method
of
legislating,
subject
to
presentment
to
the
president
for
his
approval
or
veto.
the
other
claim,
the
only
other
constitutional
objection
raised,
again
by
mr.
chadha
as
well
as
by
the
executive,
is
that
this
provision
somehow
violates
the
general
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
not
that
it
violates
any
function
vested
expressly
in
the
president
or
the
judiciary,
but
that
it
violates
simply
baron
de
montesquieu's
original
theory
of
separation
of
powers.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
that
is
turning
constitutional
analysis
upside
down.
we
must
begin
analysis
where
this
court
has
always
begun
to
evaluate
congressional
legislation,
and
that
is,
let's
see
what
congress
was
actually
doing,
what
power
was
it
trying
to
execute
when
it
adopted
this
provision
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
basically,
i
rely
upon
the
analysis
that
was
established
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
in
1819,
and
has
been
followed
literally
hundreds
of
times
by
this
court
in
evaluating
the
constitutionality
of
congressional
legislation,
where
congress
is
trying
to
exercise
some
of
its
given
power.
it
is
not
difficult
to
state
that
standard
that
marshall
laid
down.
in
the
first
part,
he
says,
let
the
end
be
legitimate.
let
it
be
within
the
constitutional
scope
of
congressional
powers.
secondly,
he
said
that
all
means
which
congress
considers
appropriate
to
a
legitimate
end
are
constitutional,
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
that
simply
means
that
there
must
be
a
rational
connection
between
the
means
and
the
end.
and
thirdly,
the
mcculloch
opinion
says
that
the
means
selected
by
the
congress
in
exercise
of
its
vast
discretion
under
this
necessary
and
proper
clause
must
be
consistent
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution.
now,
he
also
added
another
part
to
that
last
step.
in
order
for
any
other
provision
in
the
constitution
to
inhibit
or
restrict
the
means
selected
by
the
congress,
he
says,
at
page
408
of
the
mcculloch
opinion,
that
those
other
words
of
the
constitution
must
imperiously
require
a
restriction
upon
the
means.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appointments
clause
in
article
ii,
i
think
it
is,
imperiously
inhibits
any
means
selected
by
congress
whereby
congress
is
trying
to
appoint
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
so
it
is
entirely
consistent.
i
am
not
objecting
to
the
use
of
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
i
am
merely
saying
that
somehow,
if
that
is
the
objection,
the
doctrine
must
be
reduced
to
a
specific
imperious
restriction,
as
it
is
when
you
have
some
vested
presidential
power
that
is
specified
in
article
ii,
where
congress
seeks
to
invade
or
utilize.
i
think
that
is
a
clear
imperious
restriction
upon
congressional
power.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
don't
believe
the
lovett
case
had
anything
to
do
with
the
power
of
congress
vis-a-vis
the
executive.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
without
any
due
process,
and
it
was
considered
to
be
a
bill
of
attainder,
which
was
a
right
adhering
to
the
private
parties
in
those
cases.
that
was...
the
congress
was
not
there
attempting
to
execute
some
kind
of
power
that
was
vested
in
the
president.
it
was
simply
that
congress
violated
the
bill
of
attainder
clause.
now,
i
say
that
that
is
another
good
example
of
a
provision
in
the
constitution
which
might
imperiously
restrict
the
means
selected
in
a
given
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
as
i
read
the
majority
opinion
and
the
briefs
in
that
case,
that
was
the
main
and
the
only
issue
that
became
decisive
in
this
court's
opinion,
and
it
was
not
conceived
of
as
an
executive-legislative
conflict.
now,
to
quickly
address
the
mcculloch
analysis
to
the
provisions
in
section
244,
i
think
it
is
without
any
doubt
that
the
end
being
sought
in
this
legislation
was
within
the
legitimate
powers
of
the
congress
under
the
constitution.
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
section
244
thereof
are
directed
toward
the
congressional
control
over
aliens
and
deportation,
and
as
this
court
said
as
late
as
1977
in
fiallo
versus
bell,
in
430
u.
s.,
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
over
no
conceivable
subject
is
the
legislative
power
of
congress
more
complete
than
it
is
over
the
admission
of
aliens.
our
cases
have
long
recognized
the
power
to
expel
or
exclude
aliens
as
a
fundamental
sovereign
attribute
exercised
by
the
government's
political
departments,
largely
immune
from
judicial
control.
so,
the
end
sought
here,
that
is,
the
control
over
aliens,
is
certainly
a
legitimate
end.
secondly,
let
us
look
at
the
means
selected
by
the
congress
to
achieve
that
kind
of
control
or
end.
was
it
appropriate?
well,
we
have
attempted
time
and
again
in
our
briefs
to
outline
the
meaning
and
the
significance
of
section
244.
any
way
you
look
at
it,
it
is
by
intention
and
by
language
a
procedure
for
petitioning
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
be
excused
from
compliance
with
a
lawful
deportation
order.
it
replaces
the
private
bill
technique
for
attaining
identical
kind
of
relief
through
private
bill
legislation.
section
244
also
delegates
to
the
attorney
general
certain
limited
functions
in
the
consideration
of
those
petitions
or
applications.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
those
are
the
types
of
legislation,
private
legislation
i
am
referring
to.
these
are
simply
ones
that
permit
by
private
bill
an
alien
to
stay
within
this
country,
not
to
be
naturalized.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
is
a
different
operation,
but--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--no,
not
the
kind
of
private
bill,
nor
does
section
244
have
anything
to
do
with
naturalization.
it
merely
is
a--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--i
would
think
it
is
broader
than
to--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--well,
they
are
different,
is
all
i
can
say.
i
think
they
are
conceptually
different.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
well,
as
i
said,
the
attorney
general
is
given
a
limited
function,
to
wit,
he
is
given
a
certiorari-like
weeding-out
process,
a
screening
process
whereby
he
weeds
out
the
ineligible
and
the
unworthy
applicants
who
seek
this
relief,
and
he
is
authorized
to
give
temporary
stays
or
suspensions
of
deportation
to
those
who
he
considers
worthy
of
relief.
then,
he
reports
those
to
congress
for
a
final
consideration,
and
only
after
congress
considers
this
under
244(c)(2)
can
the
alien
be
excused
from
deportation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
the
interrelationships
between
article
i
and
article
ii
as--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--that
is
judicial
review.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
think--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--no.
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
said
that
you
must
grant
a
deportation.
but
you
raise
a
very
interesting
point,
justice
brennan,
and
that
is
that
if
the
attorney
general
grants
this
temporary
relief,
that
is
not
reviewable
by
the
courts.
there
is
no
aggrieved
party
in
that
situation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
know.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
would
think
that--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
likely
to
happen,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
it
ever
followed
through.
i
don't
think
congress
would
overturn,
seek
to
overturn
a
judicial
determination
of
that
nature.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
think
that
might
be
the
case,
yes.
but
the
point
finally
is
that
neither
the
presentation...
the
presentment
clause
nor
the
general
separation
of
powers
doctrine
can
be
said
to
be
an
imperious
restriction
upon
the
choice
of
means
selected
by
congress
to
execute
its
power
over
the
naturalization
or
deportation
of
aliens.
the
clause,
in
other
words,
as
was...
the
section
244,
as
this
case...
as
this
court
said
in
jay
versus
boyd,
section
244
really
calls
upon
the
congress
to
commit
an
act
of
grace.
it
is
just
like
a
pardon
given
by
the
president.
congress
is
authorized
itself
in
exercise
of
its
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
pardon,
to
excuse
a
lawful
deportation
requirement.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
is
a
legislative
act
of
grace.
that
is
what
jay
versus
boyd
said.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
at
all,
your
honor,
any
more
than
when
a
prisoner
seeks
to
get
a
pardon.
as
jay
versus
boyd
says--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--if
you...
if
you
describe
a
legislative
act
as
including
a
legislative
act
of
grace,
well
and
good,
and
i
think
there
is
a
world
of
difference.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
an
analogy
drawn
by
this
court
in
jay
versus
boyd,
an
analogy
to
what
congress
is--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--to
pardon.
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
have
nothing--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--that
is
right,
by
analogy
to
the
pardon
power
of
the
president,
but
here,
congress
has
established--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--all
i
can
do
is
to
repeat
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
jay
case,
that
an
applicant
for
suspension,
like
mr.
chadha,
comes
to
the
ins
and
to
congress
not
as
a
matter
of
right
but
as
a
matter
of
grace.
it
is
like
probation
or
suspension
of
criminal
sentence.
it
comes
as
an
act
of
grace
and
cannot
be
demanded
as
a
right,
and
they
footnote
the
analogy
to
the
presidential
pardon
power.
well,
i
see
my
time
has
expired,
but
i
will
only
conclude
by
saying
that
as
we
have
developed
at
some
length
in
the
brief,
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
the
general
separation
doctrine
simply
does
not
imperiously
prohibit
this
kind
of
action,
this
kind
of
act
of
grace
by
the
congress.
now,
you
will
note
in
that
connection
that
the
opposing
parties
are
totally
confused
as
to
what
this
act
is.
when
they
talk
about
the
presentment
clause,
they
talk
about
it
as
if
it
were
a
legislative
act.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
i
would
only...
i
would
conclude
by
repeating
or
emphasizing
what
we
have
said
in
our
briefs
concerning
the
total
lack
of
adverseness
of
parties
and
the
lack
of
standing
of
mr.
chadha
to
raise
the
executive's
powers
vis-a-vis
the
congress
in
this
situation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
speak
again
on
this
reargument
on
behalf
of
the
house
of
representatives.
this
time
i
proceed
directly
to
the
two
critical
arguments
or
contentions
of
those
who
seek
invalidation
of
section
244(c)(2)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
those
two
arguments
are:
one,
that
the
legislative
review
device
in
that
section
collides
with
the
presentment
clauses
of
article
i,
section
7.
the
second
contention
is
that
the
use
of
this
device
violates
the
general
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
these
arguments
must
be
examined
in
light
of
house
resolution
926,
an
act
adopted
in
1975
by
which
section
244(c)(2)
has
been
implemented
in
this
case.
that
examination,
i
suggest,
will
show
that
these
two
critical
contentions
in
the
context
of
this
case
are
illusory
and
misplaced,
and
that
the
faults
in
these
arguments
are
so
pervasive
as
to
implicate
article
iii
justiciability
problems.
now,
turning
to
the
first
argument,
the
presentment
clause
argument,
one
finds
that
that
argument
is
undermined
and
indeed
destroyed
by
the
negative
nature
of
house
resolution
926.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
resolution
is
incorporated,
i
think,
at
page
69a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
jurisdictional
statement.
it
reads
in
whole:
"that
the
house
of
representatives
does
not...
does
not
approve
the
granting
of
permanent
residence
in
the
united
states
to
certain
named
aliens.
"
including
mr.
chadha.
that
is
the
total
text
of
house
resolution
926.
now,
on
its
face
as
well
as
in
its
legal
effect
it
contains
a
number
of
significant
negative
propositions.
let
me
count
the
ways
in
which
it
is
negative:
one,
it
does
not
order
the
deportation
of
mr.
chadha.
mr.
chadha
came
into
this
section
244
proceeding
conceding
that
he
is
deportable
because
he
had
earlier
violated
the
statute
which...
by
overstaying
his
student
visa
by
which
he
entered
this
country,
and
under
the
statute
that
overstaying
of
a
visa
renders
him
deportable.
that
is
not
an
issue
and
never
has
been
in
this
case.
two,
house
resolution
926
does
not
alter
mr.
chadha's
legal
status
quo,
which
is
one
of
deportability.
it
has
no
effect
on
it.
three,
it
does
not
adjust
mr.
chadha's
status
to
that
of
a
permanent
resident
alien,
which
is
what
he
requested.
three...
or
four,
this
resolution
does
not
alter
or
affect
any
of
mr.
chadha's
personal
or
individual
rights.
it
is
long
established
that
an
alien,
a
deportable
alien
who
applies
for
this
kind
of
relief
comes
to
that
proceeding
with
no
rights.
it
is
a...
as
we
pointed
out
last
argument,
this
is
essentially
a
plea
for
mercy,
a
plea
for
grace
on
the
part
of
the
alien
who
seeks
to
get
his
status
changed
by
dispensation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
is
a
negative.
this
is
a
legislative
no
to
all
of
these
consequences
that
might
well
ensue.
that
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
if
either
house
had
disapproved
this
application,
then
certain
things
would
have
ensued.
then
we
would
have
had,
presumably,
some
kind
of
alteration
in
the
legal
status
quo.
but
the
critical
point
here
is
that
by
saying
no,
none
of
those
consequences
occurred
and
there
is
no
change
in
the
legal
status
quo.
to
put
it
differently,
there
is
certainly
no
kind
of
enactment
of
positive
law
which
results
from
the
house
action
saying
no.
now,
it
is
significant,
i
think,
that
the
opponents
of
this
legislative
review
device,
as
well
as
the
court
below,
have
been
unable
to
identify
any
kind
of
positive
law
change
that
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
adoption
of
house
resolution
926,
and
that
a
determination
of
a
positive
law
change,
an
identification
of
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
presentment
clause
argument.
and
i
think
they
have
utterly
failed
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
any
positive
law
change
here.
you
simply
cannot
change
a
legislative
no
into
a
legislative
yes.
now,
this
goes
straight
to
what
justice
white
was
speaking
about
in
his
opinion
in
buckley
against
valeo,
where
he
said
that
the
power
of
either
house
to
vote
to
disapprove
is
not
the
equivalent
of
legislation
or
to
an
order,
resolution
or
vote
within
the
meaning
of
article
i,
section
7,
which
requires
the
concurrence
of
both
houses.
nor
does
a
one-house
no
require
any
kind
of
presentment
to
the
president.
this
is
non-legislation.
this
is
what
happens
every
day
across
the
street
when
a
house
votes
down
a
proposal
made
by
one
of
its
members.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
this
no
is
the
equivalent
of
non-legislation,
and
it
cannot
bring
into
operation
the
presentment
clauses.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
statute
provides,
not
house
resolution,
but
the
statute
provides
that
upon
the
disapproval
by
one
house
the
attorney
general
is
directed
by
statute
to
execute
the
lawful
order
of
deportation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
he
had
no
rights
to
get
this,
an
affirmative
vote
granting
him
status
as
a
permanent
resident.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
that...
jay
versus
boyd
clearly
demonstrated
that
he
comes
into
the
application
at
the
initial
stage
before
the
attorney
general
having
absolutely
no
rights
to
get
a
favorable
determination.
it's
purely
discretionary
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general,
as
well
as
discretionary
on
the
part
of
the
congress
or
either
house
when
it
considers
that.
so
it
can
be...
it's
a
privilege
at
the
most,
not
a
right
that
he
seeks.
mr.
eugene
gressman
if
they
had
agreed
to--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--and
the
other
house
had
not
disapproved
as
well?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--under
the
statute
you
get
a
change
of
status
only
if
both...
neither
house
disapproved.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
think
that
is...
that's
incomplete
legislation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
no
action
in
the
senate,
yes,
then
it
would
have
achieved
that,
certain
consequences
which
would
change
his
status
and
permit
him
to
remain
in
this
country.
mr.
eugene
gressman
if
either
house
disapproved
or
took
any
action--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--that
is
a
form
of
legislation.
now,
that
is
not
this
case.
that
is
the
critical
point.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
that's
true
with
any
bill
that's
proposed
over
there.
if
it
fails,
that's
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
legislative
change
of
legal
status
quo
is
concerned.
now,
the
other
critical
point
i
want
to
mention
is
that
house
resolution
926
has
three
characteristics
which
reflect
a
unique
sovereign
power
vested
exclusively
in
the
congress
and
therefore
there
can
be
and
is
no
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
first,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
and
as
recently
as
three
weeks
ago
in
landon
against
placencia,
that
the
power
to
admit
or
exclude
aliens
is
a
sovereign
prerogative
that
implicates
many
of
our
problems
with
foreign
countries
and
involves
consideration
of
our
political
and
economic
circumstances
at
the
time.
and
virtually
all
of
that
sovereign
power
is
vested
in
the
congress,
and
congress
has
in
effect
created
a
kind
of
a
public
right
or
a
public
privilege
here
which
it
can
dispense
in
accordance
with
what
it
sees
most
desirable.
the
second
point
is
that
house
resolution
926
is
essentially
a
negative
answer
to
a
political
question.
ever
since
the
fong
yue
ting
decision
in
1893,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
exercise
of
this
power
over
aliens,
this
sovereign
power,
involves
answering
political
questions,
in
the
best
sense
of
that
term.
and
this
court
has
frequently
referred
to
the
purely
political
nature
of
the
legislative
power
over
aliens.
so
that
when
congress
was
saying
no
or
when
the
house
was
saying
no,
it
was
saying...
giving
a
negative
answer
to
a
political
question.
finally,
house
resolution
926
is
saying
no
within
the
traditional
area
of
legislative
discretion,
discretion
that
is
built
into
244(c)(2),
and
is
inherent
discretion
in
a
legislative
body
to
say
no.
so
we
suggest
that
a
combination
of
these
circumstances
will,
an
understanding
of
what
these
arguments
entail,
suggests
that
both
the
presentment
clause
argument
and
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
simply
do
not
apply
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
and
this
particular
statute.
mr.
eugene
gressman
reverse
a
judicial
determination
on
contempt?
no,
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that,
having
invoked
the
judicial
power,
that's
something--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
specific
separation--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
but
i
suppose
that
is
again
a
kind
of
a
public
right,
which
congress
may
or
may
not
delegate
to
the
courts
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
once
it
does
delegate
that
function,
that
kind
of
a
trial
to
the
courts,
then
it
becomes
involved
with
the
whole
inherent
judicial
power
over
cases
or
controversies.
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely.
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely.
but
that
is
basic
to
the
whole
public
rights
concept,
that
if
it
is
something
that
congress
creates
then
it
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
farming
out
some
of
those
functions
to
the
other
branches
as
it
may
see
fit.
once
it
does
farm
out
or
delegate
to
the
courts
a
matter
which
properly
may
be
said
to
be
a
case
or
controversy,
then
congress
loses
all
kind
of
control
to
review
a
judicial
decision.
but
that
is
not
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
believe
that...
i'm
not
aware
that
they've
ever
used
that
power.
now,
they
have
had
a
number
of
private
bills
in
the
past
to
give
them
relief
from--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--that
is
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
not
to
deport.
i'm
not
aware.
that
might
bring
into
play
a
bill
of
attainder
operations.
at
least
that
kind
of
an
objection
might
be
made
to
that.
but
i'm
not
aware
that
they
have
ever
used
that
kind
of
private
legislation.
