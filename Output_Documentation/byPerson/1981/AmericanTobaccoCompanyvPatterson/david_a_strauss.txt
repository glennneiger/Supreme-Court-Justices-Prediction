mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
position
that
section
703(h)
does
not
protect
an
employer's
decision
to
adopt
an
aspect
of
the
seniority
system,
although
it
may
afford
some
protection
to
subsequent
employment
decisions
made
pursuant
to
or
in
the
course
of
implementing
that
system.
this
is
not
a
belated
position,
really,
justice
blackmun.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
matter
on
its
own
before
both
the
panel
and
the
en
banc
court.
no
party
addressed
this
general
issue
of
whether
703(h)
applied
in
these
circumstances.
the
first
time
we
ever
had
occasion
to
consider
this
matter
was
when
the
case
came
to
this
court.
the
reason
we
take
this
position
is
that
no
other
interpretation
of
section
703(h)
is
suggested
by
the
language
of
that
provision,
and
the
interpretation
for
which
petitioners
contend
would
defeat
the
basic
antidiscrimination
policies
of
title
7
without
furthering
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
section
703(h)
exemption.
section
703(h)
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
apply
different
standards
of
compensation
or
different
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.
now,
whatever
else
might
be
said
about
the
decision
to
adopt
a
new
aspect
of
the
seniority
system,
that
decision
is
not
made
pursuant
to
a
seniority
system,
and
indeed,
the
petitioners,
who
place
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
language
of
section
703(h)
and
describe
it
as
a
carefully
crafted
section,
when
they
are
attacking
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
have
not
shown
any
way
in
which
that
language
can
be
read
to
immunize
the
decision
to
adopt
an
aspect
of
the
seniority
system.
in
a
similar
fashion,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
section
703(h)
was
designed
to
protect
what
its
drafters
called
seniority
rights,
that
is,
the
accumulated
expectations
of
employees
who
had
worked
under
a
system
and
relied
on
its
rules.
the
debate
over
seniority
in
congress
at
the
time
title
7
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
in
1964,
was
conducted
almost
entirely
in
terms
of
seniority
rights.
as
this
court
said
in
teamsters,
critics
of
the
bill
charged
that
it
would
destroy
existing
seniority
rights.
the
consistent
response
of
title
7's
congressional
proponents
was
that
seniority
rights
would
not
be
affected.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
that's
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
we
did
not
raise
the
ground
below.
as
i
say,
this
entire
issue
was
not
addressed
below,
but
as
respondents,
we
are
offering
it
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
are
several
cases
establishing
that
that
can
be
raised,
dandridge
and
williams,
north
carolina
against
hankerson.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
this
is
an
instance
in
which
the
court
of
appeals...
no
party
addressed
the
issue
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
know
one
offhand,
but
when
the
court
of
appeals
addresses
an
issue
that
was
never...
decides
the
case
on
the
basis
of
an
issue
that
was
never
addressed,
necessarily
the
court
must
deal
with
that
issue.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
is
certainly
comprised
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
it
is
not
a
wholly
separate
and
distinct
ground
from
the
court
of
appeals,
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
section
703(h)
does
not
apply
to
the
decision
challenged
here.
it
cast
its
net
wider,
and
assumed
that
even
if
applications
as
well
as
adoptions
were
legitimately
challenged,
that
its
rule
would
apply.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
need
to
go
that
far,
since
the
adoption
was
challenged
in
a
timely
fashion
here.
that
is
a
sufficient
basis
for...
that
would
have
been
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
as
i
said,
the
concern
of
the
drafters
of
the
act,
of
its
opponents,
indeed,
the
language
used
in
this
court's
opinions,
and
even
in
the
arguments
of
my
brothers
representing
petitioners,
has
been
that
of
seniority
rights.
and
a
challenge,
a
timely
challenge
to
the
adoption
of
a
new
aspect
of
a
seniority
system
simply
occurs
before
those
rights
develop,
and
does
not
interfere
with
or
affect
those
rights.
indeed,
typically,
as
in
this
case,
a
challenge
to
the
adoption
of
an
aspect
of
a
seniority
system
will
serve
to
vindicate
seniority
rights.
here,
employees
who
thought
their
seniority
would
entitle
them
to
certain
jobs
discovered
when
the
lines
of
progression
policy
was
instituted
that
suddenly
seniority
was
not
enough,
that
they
would
also
have
to
have
served
in
the
bottom
jobs
in
the
lines
of
progression.
their
challenge
therefore
served
to
uphold
seniority
rights,
not
to
interfere
with
them
or
affect
them,
and
to
bar
that
challenge
would
not
promote
any
of
the
purposes
of
section
703(h).
there
are
a
couple
of
points
that
petitioners
raise
in
opposition
to
this
argument.
one
is
that
it
would
somehow
be
meaningless
to
draw
this
distinction,
because
the
remedy
for
an
unlawful
adoption
of
the
seniority
system
would
necessarily
affect
the
application.
there
are
a
variety
of
answers
to
this.
the
most
straightforward
answer
is
the
one
the
court
gave
in
franks
against
bowman,
which
is
that
the
fact
that
a
remedy
might
affect
seniority
rights
is
immaterial
to
section
703(h).
section
703(h)
is
simply
not
addressed
to
remedial
adjustments
of
seniority
rights.
in
addition,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
was
the
model
for
much
of
title
7,
this
distinction
between
adoption
and
application
of
unlawful
features
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
established.
justice
harlan,
when
he
wrote
that
opinion,
machinists
local
1424,
saw
no
difficulty
with
outlawing
the
adoption
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
although
not
its
application,
even
though
obviously
the
remedy
would
have
to
run
to
application
as
well.
finally,
i
think
what
is
at
stake
here
is
that
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
then
it
is
simply
not
within
section...
then
it...
since
section
703(h)
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
it's
not
within
section
703(h)
because
it
is
not
a
decision
made
pursuant
to
a
seniority
system,
and
it
is
not
an
application
of
a
standard
of
compensation.
it
is
the
establishment
of
an
aspect
of
a
seniority
system,
so
section
703(h)
does
not
apply
for
that
reason.
it
is
then
illegal,
because
it
violates
the
substantive
prohibition,
703(a)(2).
it
limits
and
classifies
employees.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
adoption
of
a
seniority
system
is
to
be
judged,
as
you
say,
in
the
same
way
as,
say,
a
decision
whether
an
employee
has
sufficient
aptitude
to
fill
a
job.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
to
say,
7034(h)
simply
does
not
apply
to
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
703(h),
it
is
our
view
that
703(h)
would
apply.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
adoption
would
be
illegal.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
test
for
what
is
a
bona
fide
system
differs
for
the
test
of
what
is
an
illegal
employment
practice
under
other
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
say
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
the
adoption
of
a
seniority
system
from
the
adoption
of
some
other
rule.
section
703(h)
has
something
to
say
about
decisions
made
pursuant
to
a
seniority
system.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
system.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
test
for
what
is
a
bona
fide
system
differs
from
the
test
for
what
is
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
even...
in
fact,
that
is
what,
in
a
sense,
teamsters
itself
said.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
teamsters
says
that
were
it
not
for
703(h),
this
system
would
violate
the
act
as
interpreted
in
griggs.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
not
when
adopted.
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
certainly
is
right,
justice
marshall.
all
we
have
here
is
a
simple
straightforward
challenge
to
the
adoption,
which
we
say
should
be
judged,
as
justice
stevens
said,
in
the
same
way
as
any
other--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if
the
decision
to
adopt
was
made
pre
act,
it
was
not
illegal
when
it
was
made.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
isn't
protected
but
it
wasn't
illegal,
so
there
is
nothing
to
be
protected
from.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
the
act
was
not
effective,
then
actions
taken
were
not
illegal
under
the
act.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
adoption...
that
is
what
teamsters
says,
and
that
is
what
is
clear
from
the
fact
that
the
act
is
not
retroactive.
the
unlawful
decision
in
our
view
is
the
decision
to
adopt,
not
the
subsequent
decisions
to
promote
or
not
to
promote,
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
that
is
our
view.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
of
course.
this
is
always
assuming
the
seniority
system
is
bona
fide.
if
a
seniority
system
is
not
bona
fide,
then
necessarily
703(h)
does
not
apply.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
if
the
system...
this...
we
are
proceeding
on
the
assumption,
although
we
do
think
otherwise,
that
this
system
is
bona
fide.
we
are
assuming
that
arguendo.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
a
system
can
be
bona
fide
at
its
adoption
and
still
run
afoul
of
griggs.
that
has
been
established
since
griggs.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
we
do,
justice
o'connor.
we
spell
that
out
in
a
long
footnote
in
our
brief.
we
think
it
is
clear
they
are
not.
there
is
some
confusion
about
how
the
system
works,
because
the
employers
have
changed
their
explanation
of
it.
they
explain
five
times
that
it
worked
one
way,
and
then
when
the
court
of
appeals
panel
said
that
was
not
a
seniority
system,
they
changed
their
explanation.
but
the
system,
it
is
not...
the
lines
of
progression
don't
afford
a
basis
for
calculating
seniority.
they
simply
act
as
a
prerequisite
or
qualification.
if
you
haven't
served
in
a
bottom
job,
you
don't
get
a
top
job,
no
matter
what
your
seniority,
and
in
our
view
that
is
no
more
an
aspect
of
the
seniority
system
than--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
certainly,
if
this
is
not
a
seniority
system.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
we
do,
and
we
present
that
argument,
as
i
said,
in
our
brief.
thank
you.
