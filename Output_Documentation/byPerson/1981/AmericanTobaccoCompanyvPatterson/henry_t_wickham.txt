mr.
henry
t.
wickham
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
cases
were
consolidated
for
trial
and
remain
so.
the
patterson
case
is
a
class
action
case
brought
by
private
litigants
under
title
7
as
well
as
under
1981,
alleging
race
discrimination
only.
the
eeoc
case
was
brought
alleging
both
race
and
sex
discrimination.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
fourth
circuit
below
in
holding
that
703(h)
of
title
7
did
not
apply
to
seniority
systems
established
or
revised
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
the
issue
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
whether
post
act
seniority
systems
must
be
analyzed
under
the
impact
test
of
griggs
with
the
defense
of
business
necessity,
or
should
it
be
analyzed
under
703(h),
which
provides
for
intent.
if
the
fourth
circuit
is
right,
seniority
systems
are
no
longer
provided
with
the
special
treatment
that
the
congress
very
clearly
gave
them
in
enacting
703(h)
of
title
7.
our
position
simply
is
that
the
plain
language
of
703(h),
its
legislative
history,
the
labor
policy,
and
the
leading
decisions
of
this
court
all
dictate
that
703(h)
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
seniority
systems,
whether
enacted
pre
act
or
post
act.
the
particular
seniority
system
at
issue
here
are
lines
of
progression
that
are
in
effect
at
two
plants
in
richmond,
virginia,
one
a
virginia
branch
that
manufactures
cigarettes;
the
other
is
a
richmond
branch
that
manufactures
pipe
tobacco.
these
branches
are
under
separate
management
and
are
located
approximately
eight
blocks
apart.
there
are
six
lines
of
progression
at
these
two
plants.
two
of
these
lines
were
in
the
prefabrication
department,
and
involved
jobs
which
prior
to
1963
were
all
black.
two
other
lines
involved
in
this
case
involve
jobs
which
were
traditionally
all
female
prior
to
1965,
and
the
remaining
two
jobs
were
traditionally
white
male
jobs
prior
to
1963.
at
the
trial
of
these
cases
in
1974,
all
aspects
of
the
seniority
system
were
declared
invalid
under
title
7
on
the
grounds
particularly
that
it
continued
the
present
effects
of
past
discrimination.
the
district
court
ruled
that
it
was
fair,
that
the
seniority
system
was
fair
on
its
face,
but
for
the
static
conditions
of
the
industry
and
the
fact
that
american
had
not
hired
for
ten
years,
from
1955
to
1965.
it
may
not
even
need
any
implementation.
but
because
of
those
facts,
he
required
certain
relief,
and
for
american
to
do
certain
things.
on
appeal,
the
fourth
circuit,
the
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
what
we
call
patterson
one
affirmed
the
court's
ruling
concerning
the
seniority
system.
this
court
denied
cert
in
that
case.
on
remand,
during
back
pay
proceedings,
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
teamsters,
which,
as
we
all
know,
really
dramatically
altered
the
previously
prevailing
rule
concerning
impact
and
the
defense
of
business
necessity.
upon
moving
for
relief,
the
district
court
summarily
dismissed
our
contentions,
holding
that
the
seniority
system
was
not
bona
fide
and
on
appeal
of
this
decision
in
patterson
two
a
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
remanded
the
case
as
to
one
aspect
of
the
seniority
system,
which
was
what
we
have
called
the
no
transfer
rule.
this
system
did
not
permit
a
transfer
from
one
branch
or
one
plant
to
the
other
branch
or
plant
without
a
loss
of
competitive
seniority.
the
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
that
aspect
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
determination
under
703(h).
but
it
held
on
its
own
motion,
so
to
speak,
that
the
lines
of
progression
were
not
a
seniority
system.
on
rehearing
en
banc,
the
fourth
circuit
also
remanded
a
case
concerning
the
no
transfer
rule,
but
it
held
also
for
the
first
time
that
since
the
lines
of
progression
were
established
or
substantially
revised
in
january
of
1968,
they
were
not
covered
by
703(h).
they
went
on
to
hold
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
determine
the
bona
fides
of
the
no
transfer
rule,
and
that
they
did
not
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
lines
of
progression
were
a
part
of
a
seniority
system.
we
believe
that
the
fourth
circuit's
holding
is
plainly
wrong,
when
we
read
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
which
all
point
to
the
fact
that
all
seniority
systems
are
to
be
given
special
treatment,
two
memorandums
to
the
contrary,
one
being
the
justice
department
memorandum
and
another
the
case
memorandum,
which
were
both
published
to
answer
the
specific
question
of
whether
or
not
vested
seniority
rights
would
be
denied
under
title
7,
and
those
two
memorandums
answered
the
question
presented
and
nothing
more,
and
said
that
existing
seniority
rights,
of
course,
would
not
be
affected.
all
the
other
legislative
history,
including
statements
by
senator
humphrey,
senator
williams,
other
questions
submitted
by
senator
dirksen
all
point
to
the
fact
that
all
seniority
systems
are
to
be
included
within
the
cloak
of
703(h).
to
hold
otherwise
really
does
away
with
the
special
treatment
that
this
court
has
said
must
be
afforded
to
seniority
systems,
because
of
our
national
labor
policy
concerning
collective
bargaining,
and
of
course
seniority
is
a
very
major
part
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
absolutely.
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
these
systems
should
be
attacked
under
the
intent
analysis
of
703(h)
or
under
the
impact
test
of
griggs,
and
we
say
that
that
is
the
big
difference.
that
is
what
we
are
here
for,
and
we
say
that
new
systems
do
not
lose
that
immunity.
indeed,
employers
and
unions
would
be
reluctant
to
change
any
system
for
fear
that
they
would
lose
the
intent
analysis
of
703(h),
and
therefore
it
does
not
further...
our
labor
policy
of
collective
bargaining.
the
petitioner's
interpretation
seems
to
say
that
in
some
instances
a
new
system
might
be
protected
by
703(h),
but
of
course
our
system
should
not
be
protected,
and
the
bottom
line
seems
to
be
that
while
our
system
shouldn't
be
protected
because
it
is
a
discriminatory
system,
and
it
continues
the
present
effects
of
past
discrimination.
it
seems
to
me
that
patterson
and
eeoc
always
come
back
to
the
fact
that
we
have
got
a
bad
system,
but
that
is
not
what
is
before
this
court.
all
we
are
asking
here
is
that
we
be
tried
under
the
proper
statute.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
set
us
free,
but
we
should
be
tried
in
the
court
below
under
section
703(h).
i
think
that
teamsters
and
evans
and
hardison
all
point
the
way
to
the
interpretation
being
urged
in
this
court.
again,
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
take
away
the
special
treatment
that
has
been
afforded
seniority
systems.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
fourth
circuit
judgment
should
be
vacated,
and
the
district
court
should
be
directed
on
remand
to
decide
the
issues
here
of
our
seniority
system
under
703(h).
