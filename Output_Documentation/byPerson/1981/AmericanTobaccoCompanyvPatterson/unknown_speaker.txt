unknown
speaker
well,
these
systems
could
still
be
attacked
on
the
grounds
they
were
bona
fide,
couldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
could
i
interrupt
with
one
question
before
you
get
into
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
a
pre
act
seniority
system,
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
it
would
have
had
impact
that
might
have
raised
title
7
problems
if
you
didn't
apply
an
intent
test,
so
that
you
can
understand
why
an
impact
test
would
not
be
sufficient
for
a
pre
act
system.
when
you
look
at
a
post
act
system,
one
that
is
brand
new,
i
wonder
if
there
is
really
that
much
difference
between
an
intent
test
and
an
impact
test,
because
isn't
it
almost
necessary
that
when
the
system
is
designed,
the
people
are
going
to
predict
how
it
will
operate,
and
aren't
they
going
to
know
whether
or
not
it
is
going
to
have
an
adverse
impact?
in
this
case,
for
example,
wouldn't
you
know
what
the
probable
consequences
of
this
line
of
progression
would
do
and
what
it
would
not
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
know
what
the
consequences
are,
then
doesn't
that
satisfy
the
intent
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
applied
to
this
particular
case,
and
these
lines
of
progression,
it
really
seems
to
me
that
whatever
happened,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
what
the
proper
answer
is,
but
it
must
have
been
quite
predictable,
and
i
am
just
wondering
if
there
is
really
that
much
practical
difference
that
you
are
asking
to
have
the
trial
judge
face
up
to
on
retrial.
unknown
speaker
so
even
with
full
knowledge
of
the
inevitability
of
discriminatory
impact,
that
is
what
it
amounts
to.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
in
one
division
all
of
the
employees
are
white,
and
you
enforce
seniority,
that
doesn't
discriminate?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
use
the
word
"intentional".
it
is
awful
hard
to
find
a
difference
as
to
whether
somebody
stops
you
from
eating
intentionally
or
unintentionally.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
one
of
the
groups
in
this
case
in
the
category
i
said,
which
is
all
of
one
race?
unknown
speaker
and
somebody
had
to
show
intent
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
want
me
to
ignore
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
i
gather
you
say
that
standard
is
an
intention
to
discriminate,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
whether
its
adoption
or
application
of
the
seniority
system?
unknown
speaker
by
the
eeoc.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
to
their
former
position.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
703(h)
speaks
in
terms
of
application,
not
adoption,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
rosenberg,
is
there
a
question
of
the
date
when
the
new
system
was
made
effective
at
all
important
in
this
case?
i
see
there
is
a
debate
whether
it
was
january,
'68,
or
in
fact
shortly
before
1969
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
would
you
address
yourself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
lines
of
progression
are
part
of
the
seniority
system
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
they
were.
unknown
speaker
they
passed
it.
even
if
they
are,
the
act...
the
seniority
systems
post
act
are
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
they
didn't
decide
that
they
were.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
an
open
issue
on
remand,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
a
little
bit
how
it
works?
are
the
lower
jobs
in
the
line
of
progression...
is
entry
related
in
any
way
to
seniority,
into
those
lower
jobs?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
if
you
prevail,
i
take
it
we
will
have
to
address,
will
we
not,
the
eeoc
adoption
versus
application
argument?
won't
the
district
court
have
to
have
some
guidance
as
to
how
to
handle
that?
unknown
speaker
belated,
belated
as
the
argument
may
be,
as
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
particularly
since
i
gather
the
argument
is
that
in
respect
of
adoption,
there
may
be
a
violation
without
proof
of
intention.
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
in
respect
of
application
that
you
need
proof--
unknown
speaker
january,
1968.
unknown
speaker
and
the
complaint
was
filed
in
january
of
'69,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
when
was
the
complaint
filed?
unknown
speaker
1969.
within
the
90-day
period.
unknown
speaker
the
dates
of
adoption
are
november
and
december
of
'68,
then
this
was
within
the
90-day
period.
unknown
speaker
is
it
true
that
you
have
to
have
seniority
to
enter
the
lowest
job
in
the
line
of
progression?
is
that
how
the
entry
level
jobs
are
determined?
unknown
speaker
and
you
can't
get
started
in
the
line
of
progression
without
seniority?
i
mean,
that
is
the
basis
for
getting
into
it
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
mr.
marsh,
if
we
should
not
agree
with
you,
and
should
agree
that
the
lines
of
progression
are
part
of
a
seniority
system--
unknown
speaker
--then
do
you
go
along
with
the
eeoc
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
adoption
of
that
system
and
is
application?
in
the
former
case,
it
may
be
a
violation
without
proof
of
intent,
but
not
in
the
latter?
unknown
speaker
timely,
that
has
to
do
with
the
complaint
filed
in
january
of
'69.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
if
you
can
show
that,
mr.
marsh,
won't
you
win
under
the
test
promulgated
by
the
company
and
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
congress
didn't,
but
if
the
fourth
circuit
is
wrong,
and
it
did,
subject
only
to
a
bona
fide
challenge,
it
seems
if
the
evidence
is
what
you
say
it
is,
you
should
win
on
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
marsh,
i
take
it
the
en
banc
court
didn't
decide
whether
the
lines
of
progression
were
part
of
a
seniority
system.
unknown
speaker
they
just
said,
even
if
it
was,
the
act
doesn't
protect
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
was.
the
only
thing
is,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
panel,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
was
set
aside.
it
was
vacated.
that
opinion
doesn't
stand
for
anything
any
more.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
en
banc
court
didn't
decide
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
urge
us
to
decide
that,
though,
now,
that
the
seniority
system...
that
the
lines
of
progression
were
not
part
of
a
seniority
system.
you
submit
that
issue
to
us.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
we
agreed
with
you,
would
you
be
satisfied?
is
that
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know,
but
that
is
all
you
are
trying
to
win
here?
unknown
speaker
but
then
we
would
not
be--
unknown
speaker
--that's
right.
so
they
are
mutually
exclusive
questions.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me,
mr.
strauss,
if
we
agree
with
your
distinction
that
adoption
is
not
pursuant
to
and
therefore
the
immunity
does
not
apply,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do,
affirm
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
you
can
ask
us
to
do
this
if
you
raised
that
ground
below.
did
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
some
cases
where
we
have
affirmed
on
a
ground
that
wasn't
ventilated
below
at
all,
wasn't
raised,
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
we...
you
can
affirm
on
a
ground
that
wasn't
decided
below,
but
do
you
have
a
case
specifically
where
the
ground
used
was
never
raised
or
presented
to
anybody
below?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
a
case
in
this
court
where
we
affirmed
on
a
ground
that
was
never
raised
in
any
of
the
courts
below
by
any
of
the
parties?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
deal
with
that,
but
your
ground,
the
ground
you
are
presenting
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
your
position
is
that
adoption
is
simply
not
pursuant
to
and
therefore
the
immunity,
statutory
immunity
can't
apply
to
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
even
remotely
suggests
that
basis
of
the
inapplicability
of
the
immunity
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
argument?
are
you
in
essence
arguing
that
the
adoption
of
a
new
seniority
system
or
a
new
aspect
of
a
seniority
system
should
be
judged
by
the
same
standard
as
the
adoption
of
any
other
employment
practice
after
the
act?
unknown
speaker
that
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
act
that
says
adoption
of
these
kinds
of
rules
are
different
from
the
adoption
of
any
other
kind
of
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
follows
under
your
argument...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
am
stating
it
right...
that
if
that
is
true,
and
if
under
the
impact
test
the
lines
of
progressions
are
illegal,
whether
you
call
it
a
seniority
system
or
what,
whatever,
then
it
is
not
"bona
fide".
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
reason
it
is
not
within
section
703(h)
is
because
it
is
not
bona
fide,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
decision
to
adopt,
but
supposing
they
implemented
the...
what
do
you
call
this
again,
the--
--progression.
--progression
system,
later
on,
by
promoting
some
people,
promoting
some
whites
and
not
some
blacks.
then
they
are
implementing,
if
you
concede
it
is
a
seniority
system,
then
they
would
be
making
implementing
decisions,
but
would
it
not
follow,
if
your
analysis
is
correct,
that
they
would
be
implementing
a
seniority
system
which
was
illegal
at
the
time
of
its
adoption,
and
therefore
was
not
bona
fide?
so
wouldn't
your
argument
necessarily
carry
with
it
the
implication
of
this
particular
system
adopted
after
the
act
if
it
fails
to
meet
the
impact?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
what
applies,
then,
to
implementing
decisions
under
this
progression,
this
rule
of
progression
that
has
been
adopted,
whether
illegally
or
not?
unknown
speaker
if
you
call
it
a
seniority
system,
does
703(h)
apply
then
to
the
implementing
decision?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
would
be
illegal.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
adoption
is
illegal,
how
could
it
be
a
bona
fide
system?
unknown
speaker
does
it
after
the
act...
what
in
the
legislative
history
says
that
there
is
a
different
standard
for
judging
the
adoption
of
a
seniority
system
as
opposed
to
the
adoption
of
an
eligibility
or
promotion
rule?
unknown
speaker
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
system.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
carry
your
argument
to
its
logical
extreme.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
that
even
if
the
system
were
an
unlawful
system
it
could
nevertheless
be
a
bona
fide
system
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
teamsters
dealt
with
a
system
adopted
before
the
act
was
passed,
and
by
hypothesis
could
not
have
been
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
when
adopted,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
strauss,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
your
position
apply
to
the
adoption
of
the
seniority
system
whenever
it
was
adopted,
pre
act
or
post
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it
nevertheless
isn't
protected.
unknown
speaker
but
it
would.
your
position
is
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
when
it
was
adopted.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
is
what
teamsters
says.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
is
a
pre
act
seniority
system
that
is
implemented
afterwards.
that
implementation
is
protected?
unknown
speaker
if
the
seniority
system
was
bona
fide?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that...
don't
you
have
to
answer
the
question
about
whether
the
seniority
system
was
adopted
bona
fide?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
your
theory
would
mean
that
the
seniority
system
could
never
be
bona
fide
at
its
adoption.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
position
on
whether
the
lines
of
progression
are
part
of
a
seniority
system?
unknown
speaker
you
agree
that
the
court
could
resolve
the
case
on
that
basis
then?
unknown
speaker
this
court.
unknown
speaker
taking
that
literally,
that
is
clearly
inaccurate.
you
can't
say
the
bill
had
no
impact
on
seniority,
can
you?
is
that
your
position,
that
the
statute
has
no
application
ever
to
seniority?
that
is
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it
has
some
application
to
seniority.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
suggesting
that
isolated
statement
isn't
a
response
to
the
argument,
really.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
that
the
adoption
of
subsequent
seniority
plans
should
be
judged
by
any
different
standard
than
the
adoption
of
other
eligibility
rules
or
work
practices,
whatever
it
might
be?
unknown
speaker
seniority
rights.
i
gather
this
is
just
an
argument
that
adoption,
application,
pre
or
post
act,
it
didn't
matter,
703(h)
immunized
it.
unknown
speaker
without
regard
to
when
the
seniority
system
was
adopted,
pre
or
post
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
really
follow.
it
has
application,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
to
post
act
systems.
but
it
has
application
to
the
application
of
post
act
systems.
that
is
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
a
bona
fide
post
act
system.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
that
says
the
adoption
of
a
post
act
system
shall
be
judged
by
any
different
standard
than
the
adoption
of
any
other
work
practice.
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
didn't
use
any
word...
it
uses
the
word
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"adopt".
there
is
a
very
big
difference
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
emphasized
the
earlier,
the
existing
seniority
system,
but
in
effect
you
might
read
the
statute
to
say
that
all
existing
systems
are
bona
fide
because
they
were
lawful
when
they
were
adopted.
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
adoption.
and
the
application
of
those
is
hereby
protected.
and
the
application
of
future
adopted
systems
that
are
lawful
is
also
protected.
that
is
a
fairly
simple
reading.
