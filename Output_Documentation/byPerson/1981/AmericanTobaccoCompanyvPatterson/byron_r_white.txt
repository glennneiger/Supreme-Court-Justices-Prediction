under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
employment
practices
are
illegal
if
they
are
purposely
discriminatory
or
if
they
have
that
effect.
section
703(h)
of
the
act
however
says
that
an
employer
may
treat
their
employees
differently
pursuant
to
a
seniority
system
if
that
system
--
what
was
--
is
not
--
it
was
--
if
--
provided
that
system
is
not
racially
discriminatory
intentionally.
a
seniority
system
that
just
has
a
racially
discriminatory
effect
is
not
illegal
under
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
section
703(h)
protected
only
those
seniority
systems
that
were
adopted
prior
to
the
date
the
civil
rights
act
that
was
passed.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
703(h)
applies
to
all
seniority
systems
whether
they
were
adopted
before
or
after
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
act.

justice
