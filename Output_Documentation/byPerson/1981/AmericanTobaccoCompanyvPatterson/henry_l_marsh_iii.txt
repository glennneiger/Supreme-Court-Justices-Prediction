mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
class
of
black
employees
before
this
court
is
represented
by
five
men
who
at
the
august,
1974,
trial
date
had
a
total
of
122
years
of
service
with
the
american
tobacco
company.
two
of
these
men
were
among
the
small
number
of
black
employees
who
in
november
of
1968
had
overcome
some
of
the
barriers
which
this
company
and
union
had
erected
to
prevent
black
employees
from
moving
into
the
higher
paying
white
jobs.
the
plantwide
posting
and
bidding
system
which
had
become
effective
on
january
15,
1968,
had
at
least
on
paper
opened
the
door
to
black
employee
movement
into
jobs
in
the
previously
white
departments,
but
this
door
which
had
been
opened
in
january
was
slammed
shut
in
november
of
1968,
when
this
company
and
union
adopted
the
lines
of
progression,
which
for
all
practical
purposes
prevented
black
employees
from
securing
these
higher
paying
white
jobs.
now,
a
question
has
been
raised
about
the
date
the
lines
were
adopted.
the
fourth
circuit
did
say
january,
but
the
fourth
circuit
was
focusing
on
whether
they
were
pre
act--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--january
of
'68,
but
the
circuit
court
was
focusing
on
whether
they
were
pre
act
or
post
act.
the
specific
date
was
not
important.
mr.
wickham,
on
page
520
of
the
fourth
circuit
appendix,
asked
the
company's
director
of
manufacturing,
when
were
the
lines
of
progression
adopted?
he
said,
november
of
1968.
in
his
opening
statement,
on
page
34
of
the
trial
transcript,
line
22,
mr.
wickham
said,
the
lines
of
progression
were
adopted
in
november
of
1968,
and
on
pages
244
and
247
of
the
transcript,
it
is
clear
that
the
lines
were
adopted
by
a
group
of
people
in
november
of
1968
and
ratified
by
the
union
in
march
of
1969.
now,
these
lines
of
progression--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--january
of
'68
was
the
lines
of
progression.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
the
complaint
was
filed
in
january
of
'69.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
it
was
45
days
or
so
after
the
lines
of
progression
had--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--yes,
there
is
no
problem
about
that.
they
stipulate
that
they
were
within
the
time.
now,
these
lines
of
progression
placed
the
highest
paying
hourly
paid
jobs
completely
beyond
the
reach
of
the
black
employees.
this
was
true
because
the
black
employees
had
been
previously
kept
away
from
these
jobs,
and
they
had
been
kept
away
from
the
lower
jobs
in
the
lines
of
progression
by
such
practices
as
the
overt
departmental
segregation
which
mr.
wickham
alluded
to,
which
had
been
in
effect
until
1963,
and
then
the
subjective
supervisory
determinations
by
a
white
supervisory
work
force
from
1963
until
1968.
so,
when
the
lines
of
progression
were
adopted,
in
1968,
only
one
black
held
a
position
in
these
top
jobs
in
the
seven
white
lines
of
progression.
now,
five
years
after
these
lines
were
adopted,
whites
still
held
all
but
one
of
the
top
121
jobs
in
those
lines.
now,
it
is
this
practice,
instituted
well
after
the
passage
of
title
7,
after
the
effective
date
of
title
7,
for
which
this
company
and
union
seek
to
invoke
the
protection
of
703(h)
of
title
7.
there
are
two
basic
questions
before
this
court.
first,
whether
the
fourth
circuit
panel
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
lines
of
progression
are
not
a
part
of
a
seniority
system,
and
therefore
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
703(h),
and
second,
whether
the
lines
of
progression
system
instituted
by
an
employer
and
a
union
after
the
effective
date
of
title
7
is
protected
by
703(h)
where
the
system
perpetuates
the
employer's
and
the
union's
own
intentional,
prior
intentional
discrimination.
in
our
judgment,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
address
the
case
presented
by
the
outer
limits
of
the
rule
announced
by
the
fourth
circuit,
that
no
post
act
seniority
system
is
protected
by
703(h).
the
case
actually
in
issue
before
the
fourth
circuit
and
actually
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
was
decided
correctly.
now,
we
believe
the
fourth
circuit
panel
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
lines
of
progression
are
not
a
part
of
a
seniority
system.
in
the
lines
in
question
here,
neither
the
length
of
time
served
in
the
line
nor
the
length
of
time
served
in
a
lower
job
is
a
factor
in
determining
which
employees
can
bid
on
the
top
jobs.
only
the
fact
of
prior
service
in
a
lower
job
is
of
any
importance.
just
touching
that
base
for
any
period
of
time
would
be
sufficient
to
qualify
you
for
the
next
job.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
clearly
an
eligibility
requirement
which
must
be
met
before
an
employee
can
exercise
his
seniority.
it
is
something
that
runs
counter
to
seniority
rather
than
something
that
is
implementing
a
seniority
system.
we
think
this
question
is
controlled
by
both
the
teamsters
case
and
the
california
brewers
case,
where
this
court
apparently
anticipated
this
very
question.
the
lines
of
progression
here
distort
the
seniority
system.
they
do
not
focus
on
length
of
service
and
employment.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
that
is
how
you
get
access
to
the
entry
level
jobs
in
the
line,
but
once
you
get
in
the
entry
level
jobs
in
the
line,
once
you
serve
in
one
of
the
entry
level
jobs,
the
fact
that
you
have
served
there
means
that
then
you
are
eligible
for
the
next
line.
the
other
employees
in
the
company
cannot
move
in
those
lines.
you
only
have
to
be...
just
like
a
residency
requirement
or
like
a
high
school
diploma.
it
is
a
requirement
that
you
have
to
complete
before
you
are
eligible
to
use
your
seniority.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
well,
you
can
get
into
a
lower
job
in
the
line
by
seniority,
but
once
you
get
in
the
lower
line,
you
cannot
get...
the
lower
jobs
are
not
really
in
question.
it
is
the
top
jobs
we
are
concerned
about,
and
you
can't
get
to
one
of
those
top
jobs,
i
don't
care
how
much
seniority
you
have,
unless
you
have
served
in
the
lower
lines,
and
that
is
what
makes
this
not
a
part
of
a
seniority
system.
this
is
something
that
distorts
the
seniority
system,
because
the
employees
with
long
years
of
seniority
can't
get
at
these
jobs
because
of
this
eligibility
requirement.
remember,
the
blacks
had
been
kept
away
from
these
jobs,
so
they
have
not
had
a
chance
to
get
into
these
jobs.
the
whites
are
already
in
these
lines
of
progression.
so,
in
order
to
be
in
there,
you
have
to
have
been
in
the
lower
job.
that
is
the
question
that
makes
this
different.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
that
is
my
second
argument,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
we
do
not
oppose
the
government's
interpretation.
that
is
not
our
interpretation.
we
think
the
application
of
the
government's
interpretation
to
this
case
would
require
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below,
because
here
a
timely
objection
was
made
to
the
adoption
of
the
system,
and
the
adoption
of
the
system
here--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--right.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
and
the
adoption
of
the
system
here
established
a
new
qualification
for
the
top
jobs.
so
no
matter
how
much
seniority
an
employee
had,
he
had
to
have
served
in
a
bottom
job
in
order
to
get
to
the
top
job,
and
because
the
bottom
jobs
in
the
most
desirable
lines
of
progression
had
been
deliberately
reserved
for
whites
over
the
years,
the
decision
to
adopt
the
lines
of
progression
operated
to
freeze
the
status
quo
of
the
prior
discriminatory
employment
practice,
so
this
court
could
affirm
on
that
ground
without
reaching
the
interpretation
that
we
urge.
however,
we
believe
that
our
reading
of
703(h)
is
more
consistent
with
the
legislative
history,
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
minute,
and
with
the
underlying
purposes
of
title
7.
if
you
have
to
adopt
a
plain
meaning,
which
is
what
the
union
and
company
observe,
or
ask
you
to
do,
we
think
the
government's
plain
meaning
is
certainly
more
reasonable
than
the
company's
plain
meaning.
we
submit
the
second
question
assumes
that
the
lines
of
progression
are
part
of
a
seniority
system.
we
submit
that
in
enacting
703(h),
congress
did
not
intend
to
protect
this
system
here,
because
the
actual
overt
and
departmental
segregation
which
has
confined
blacks
to
these
prefab
department
jobs
until
1963
was
modified.
the
racially
motivated
discrimination
continued.
until
1968
black
employees
were
excluded
from
white
jobs
by
intentional
discriminatory
policies.
as
i
indicated,
the
white
work
force
continued
to
restrict
black
employees
to
the
black
jobs
by
subjective,
unwritten
standards,
selection
procedures,
and
it
was
against
this
background
that
the
company
and
union
in
november
instituted
the
lines
of
progression.
clearly,
a
post
act
system.
and
it
was
these
lines,
a
brand
new
system,
which
created
new
rights
for
white
employees,
after
the
act,
and
prevented
senior
black
employees
from
securing
the
higher
paying
white
jobs.
it
is
these
lines
for
which
immunity
under
703(h)
is
sought.
now,
what
the
union
attorney
urges
is
that
in
deciding
whether
703(h)
applies
to
this
system,
the
court
can
make
that
determination
by
focusing
exclusively
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
but
the
government
has
a
different
plain
meaning,
so
it
shows
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
and
it
demonstrates
why,
as
this
court
held
in
franks,
and
teamsters.
703(h)
must
be
read
against
the
legislative
history,
against
the
background
of
its
history
and
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
context
in
which
title
7
arose.
the
three
documents
introduced
into
the
congressional
record
by
senator
clark
which
were
hailing
teamsters
as
the
authority
of
indicators
of
703(h)'s
purpose,
point
out
that
703(h)
was
referring
to
the
rights
existing
at
the
time
it
takes
effect,
or
vested,
or
established
seniority
rights,
or
existing
systems.
the
clark
case
memo
states
that
title
7
would
have
no
effect
on
established
seniority
rights.
in
fact,
it
makes
this
statement.
"its
effect
is
prospective
and
not
retrospective.
"
now,
senators
clark
and
case
were
the
bipartisan
co
captains
of
title
7,
and
their
statements
should
be
given
a
lot
of
weight
rather
than
statements
made
by
other
senators
in
response
to
other
questions.
these
statements
indicate
that
the
purpose
of
title
7
was
to
assure
the
bill's
opponents
that
title
7
would
not
require
preferential
treatment
of
minorities
at
the
expense
of
rights
existing
at
the
time
title
7
took
effect,
and
franks
and
teamsters,
after
very
careful
study,
the
entire
court
seemed
to
agree
that
the
thrust
of
703(h)
was
the
validation
of
seniority
systems
in
existence
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
it
certainly
appears
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
immunize
post
act
seniority
systems,
and
even
if
it
did,
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
703(h)
to
protect
a
system
like
this,
a
post
act
system
which
perpetuated
the
effects
of
prior
intentional
discrimination
by
the
very
company
and
union
which
were
involved
in
perpetuating
that
discrimination.
now,
on
this
business
about
the
national
policy
of
collective
bargaining,
there
are
circumstances
where
there
may
be
a
conflict
between
the
national
policy
supporting
collective
bargaining
and
the
congressional
priority
to
eliminate
discrimination.
when
those
situations
exist,
this
court
has
said
that
the
resolution
depends
on
the
facts
involved,
but
that
conflict
cannot
exist
in
this
case,
where
the
industry
involved,
the
company,
and
the
union
involved
have
a
long
history
of
actively
operating
and
maintaining
a
caste
like
system
of
confining
black
employees
to
the
lowest
paying
and
the
most
menial
jobs.
that
conflict
can't
exist
here,
where
such
system
was
perpetuated
up
until
the
very
day
of
trial,
three
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
we
should
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
your
honor,
on
that
question,
because
we
have
been
litigating
this
case
since...
the
charges
were
filed
in
1969,
and
why
should
every
time
a
new
theory
comes
up...
my
plaintiffs
have
not
yet
gotten
any
relief.
some
of
them
are
dead.
and
we
have
won
every
round
of
this
case,
and
no
one
has
gotten...
they
have
not
gotten
a
single
bit
of
back
pay
or
any
injunctive
relief.
why
should
we
have
to
go
back
when
congress
didn't
intend
to
protect
this
kind
of
system?
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
well,
the
point
is,
your
honor,
we
should
not
have
to
go
back.
we
have
been
litigating
this
case
for
years,
and
if
the
company
and
union
intended
to
avail
themselves
of
the
protection
of
703(h),
it
was
their
responsibility.
that
is
an
exception
to
the
general
statute.
to
show
that
they
were
entitled
to
that
protection.
they
didn't
show
that.
there
is
no
confusion
in
this
record.
they
say
it
for
five
times,
that
this
was...
that
this
was
plantwide
seniority,
and
then
after
the
dissenting
opinion
came
out
by
judge
widener,
then
they
changed
their
position,
when
he
pointed
out
they
could
possibly
win
the
case
if
the
seniority
was
determined
by
within
the
lines.
they
changed
their
position.
it
is
their
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
protection
of
703(h).
they
did
not
do
that.
so
we
think
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct
in
deciding
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
that's
correct.
they
said
they--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--that's
correct.
they
say
we
believe
very
strongly
that
it
wasn't,
and
by
the
way,
that
question
was
litigated
below.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
it
was
suggested
earlier
that
it
wasn't.
it
was
litigated
by
all
the
parties.
it
was
decided
by--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--well,
the
panel
did
decide
it.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
they
wrote
an
opinion
on
it.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
well,
in
the
en
banc
opinion,
the
justices
still...
the
court
still
indicated
that,
the
justices
on
the
panel,
to
reaffirm
their
position.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
that's
true.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
case,
because
we
have
to
go
back
for
back
pay
and
other
things,
but
if
you
agreed--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--well,
if
you
agree
that
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
seniority
system,
then
that
would
end
this
issue,
and
we
think
you
can
under
the--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--you
would
not
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
703(h)
protects
this
particular
seniority
system,
or--
mr.
henry
l.
marsh,
iii
--they
are
not,
and
under
the
yuakim
versus
miller
case,
we
think
that
this
is
not
such
a
case,
because
the
issues
were
briefed
by
all
the
parties
below,
it
was
briefed
and
discussed
and
resolved
in
the
fourth
circuit,
and
simply
because
the
en
banc
court
didn't
reach
it,
we
think
under
yuakim
versus
miller
you
can
decide
the
question
on
that
basis,
but
if
you
don't,
we
submit
that
the
congressional
policy
favoring
equal
employment
opportunity
should
outweigh
any
policy
that
would
be
served
by
authorizing
employees
and
unions
to
adopt
post
act
systems
which
have
no
business
justification,
and
which
perpetuate
their
own
intentional
discrimination.
