mr.
ronald
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
and
the
problem
that
this
court
must
address
is
to
reconstitute
the
values
that
existed
as
the
congress
decided
this
controversial
and
critical
piece
of
legislation
in
1964,
and
the
question
is
how
to
apply
the
traditional
mechanisms
of
statutory
interpretation
to
this
situation
and
to
recreate
1964,
a
troubled
time
in
american
history.
in
1964,
this
bill
was
before
the
congress.
it
was
controversial.
the
debates
on
it
were
protracted.
the
alliances
in
support
of
the
bill
were
under
constant
attack,
and
they
were
under
particular
attack
in
the
area
that
this
court
must
now
address,
and
that
is
to
what
extent
were
the
beneficial
provisions
of
title
7
to
deal
with
the
difficult
questions
of
seniority
that
were
repeatedly
used
as
a
method
for
challenging
the
passage
of
title
7
by
its
opponents
who
acted
vigorously
indeed.
and
thus,
the
proponents
of
the
bill,
considering
the
charge
that
this
bill
would
attack
seniority,
that
this
bill
would
affect
seniority
rights,
were
called
upon
repeatedly
to
lay
to
rest
what
they
considered
to
be
a
canard,
that
the
bill
would
affect
seniority
rights.
and
ultimately,
as
that
debate
continued,
not
only
did
the
various
proponents
of
the
bill
speak
broadly
and
without
qualification
that
the
bill
would
not
affect
seniority
rights
at
all,
ultimately
they
found
it
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
final
passage
of
this
critical
bill
to
add
to
the
statute
section
703(h),
which
confirmed
as
a
part
of
the
actual
statute
rather
than
its
legislative
history
the
acknowledgement
that
they
had
made
that
seniority,
the
seniority
principle
was
a
preferred
value
that
was
to
be
maintained
so
long
as
seniority
was
not
used
as
a
subterfuge,
compressed
within
the
phrase,
the
provision
that
ultimately
became
703(h),
the
phrase
"bona
fide"
and
the
provision
that
there
is
to
be...
seniority
systems
would
be
protected
if
they
were
bona
fide,
and
not
themselves
a
demonstration
of
intentional
discrimination.
the
congress
had
compressed
in
703(h)
its
strong
desire
to
deal
with
these
conflicting
policies,
policy
that
could
have
separated
the
alliance
that
had
created
title
7.
and
so,
against
that
legislative
context,
we
must
look
to
the
development
of
this
statute
as
it
worked
its
way
through.
as
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
and
as
mr.
wickham
responded,
the
impact
of
the
decision
here
in
our
favor
would
mean
that
we
would
go
through
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
seniority
systems
here
involved
were
in
fact
bona
fide
or
the
product
of
intention
to
discriminate.
a
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
end
this
case.
it
would
merely
give
us
the
opportunity
on
the
remand
to
show
what
we
have
consistently
maintained,
that
these
systems
are
indeed
bona
fide.
but
let
us
look
for
the
moment
to
the
legislative
history
as
it
developed
through
the
congress
in
1964,
looking
at
that
legislative
history
from
the
view
of
the
proponents.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes,
there
might
well
be...
there
might
be
well
the
impact,
but
we
would
not,
your
honor,
be
adopting--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--no,
because
the
seniority
principle
is
a
broader
principle.
we
might
well
be
operating
in
order
to
enhance
the
seniority
principle.
our
intent
might
be
a
bona
fide
intent,
an
intent
not
to
discriminate.
when
one
views
the
entirety
of
the
situation,
there
could
be
situations
where
by
reason
of
technological
change
or
the
like,
there
is
a
need
to
adopt
what
could
be
referred
to
as
a
new
system.
one
would
know--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--i
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
practical
difference,
your
honor.
we
could
introduce
evidence
that
would
show...
of
our
intention,
show
corrective
measures
that
we
had
taken
in
the
past,
and
show
that
we
were
intent
upon
preserving
the
seniority
principle,
not
upon
discriminating,
and
that
adverse
impact
will
follow
in
almost
every
instance
from
the
seniority
principle.
there
is
a
tension
between
seniority
and
the
potentiality
of
the
perpetuation
of
past
discrimination,
but
yet
we
can
adopt
the
seniority
principle
without
an
intent
to
discriminate,
because
we
are
adhering
to
the
seniority
principle,
which
is--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
not
intentionally,
your
honor.
it
may
have
the
impact--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--but
that
is
the
difference,
your
honor,
that
the
congress
has
mandated
the
courts
to
follow
by
its
adoption
of
703(h).
congress
was
concerned
at
the
difference,
and
if
we
have
a
difficult
task
of
proof
at
trial,
we
are
prepared
to
undertake
that
task
of
proof,
but
we
should
not
be
subjected
to
a
test
that
congress
had
indicated
was
not
to
apply,
which
is
the
disparate
impact
test.
we
are
entitled
to
a
determination
based
upon
whether
there
is
a
finding
of
intention
to
discriminate.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes,
there
was
division
in
the
respective
departments,
but
as
mr.
wickham
pointed--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--not
standing
alone.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
would
be
a
need
for
more.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
that
may
well
be,
your
honor,
but
that
would
not
determine
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
issue
would
be,
did
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
all
available
evidence
conclude
that
the
adoption--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--i
am
not
suggesting
you
ignore
it,
your
honor.
i
am
suggesting
that
what
we
do
is
apply
the
standard
that
congress
had
intended
to
be
applied.
we
might
win
or
we
might
lose,
but
we
are
entitled
to
a
determination
under
the
standard
adopted
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
your
honor
is,
i
take
it,
addressing
the
argument
made
by
the
eeoc--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--to
which
i
would
like
to
direct
my
attention.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
think
it
very
significant
that
the
eeoc
has
adopted
a
position
quite
different
than
that
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
position
indicates
an
acknowledgement
that
as
regards
the
implementation
of
post
act
systems,
our
conduct
would
be
judged
under
703(h)
and
the
discriminatory
standard,
so
that
the
eeoc
has
said
at
least
as
far
as
implementation,
which
is
the
far
more
predominant
instance
where
charges
could
be
made,
post
act
systems
are
entitled
to
protection
under
703(h),
and
in
doing
so
they
are
taking
a
position
contradictory
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
to
the
position
advanced
by
the
private
respondents.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
and
to
their
former
position.
very
important,
your
honor,
that
the
reading
that
they
now
advance
is
advanced
for
the
first
time
between
the
time
of
their
opposition
to
certiorari
and
their
brief
in
this
court,
and
yet
it
is
based
upon
a
reading
that
they
claim
follows
from
the
statute.
certainly
it
took
them
a
very,
very
long
time
to
find
that
reading,
a
reading
that
is
not
supported
by
the
statutory
language,
a
reading
that
is
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
there
is
not
an
iota,
not
a
trace
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
intention
to
draw
the
distinction
between
adoption
and
implementation
that
the
eeoc
now
urges.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
it
uses
that
language.
there
is
a
conceivable
reading,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
reading
that
is
at
war
with
the
essence
of
703(h),
which
is
intended
to
apply
and
makes
clear
to
bona
fide
systems,
seniority
systems,
and
there
is
no
support
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
for
the
reading
that
the
eeoc
has
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
concluded
is
the
appropriate
reading.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
it
is
of
consequence,
your
honor,
only
to
the
extent
that
it
demonstrates
that
even
factually
the
eeoc
position
is
immeritorious,
that
the
eeoc...
the
charges
that
were
before
the
eeoc
would
have
been
out
of
time,
but
in
terms
of
the
central
parts
of
this
case,
that
argument
i
don't
think
is
particularly
relevant.
it
merely
points
up,
as
the
company's
brief
did,
the
lack
of
merit
in
the
newly
advanced
eeoc
position.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
they
clearly
are,
and
were
so
determined
to
be
so,
your
honor,
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
in
this
court
a
case
in
which
the
lines
of
progression
are
acknowledged
to
be
part
of
a
seniority
system,
and
the--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
treated
them
as
a
part
of
the
seniority
system
because
of
their
conclusion
on
the
statutory
language.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
that
presumably
could
be
a--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
now,
clearly,
under
california
brewers,
we
believe
that
the
lines
of
progression
can
easily
be
shown
under
california
brewers
and
teamsters
to
be
part
of
a
seniority
system.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes,
entry
at
the
lowest
level
is
by
plant
seniority,
the
broadest
measure
of
seniority.
in
order
to
get
to
the
first
step
in
the
line
of
progression,
there
is
the
use
of
plantwide
seniority,
and
at
that
point,
as
we
describe
in
our
reply
brief,
the
first
of
the
two
elements
of
seniority
applies.
you
determine
who
is
to
be
in
the
competition,
the
unit
of
competition
that
is
to
be
used
in
applying
the
next
part
of
a
seniority
mechanism,
which
is
the
measure
of...
the
measure
to
be
applied
in
determining
advancement
from
the
entry
level
job
up
to
the
next
job
on
the
line
of
progression.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
would
think,
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--yes,
i
think
your
honors
would
have...
will
have
to
deal
with
the
eeoc
argument.
i
think
that
is
clear.
it
is
made,
however
late
and
however
immeritorious.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--a
distinction,
your
honor,
that
is
meaningless
in
the
real
world,
because
if
one
is
to
attack
adoption
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
meaningful
remedy,
there
must
be
impact
on
the
application
of
the
rule,
so
that
the
eeoc
rule
simply
can't
be
squared
in
the
real
world.
it
has
no
practical
significance,
and
must
be...
and
we
certainly
could
not
ascribe
to
the
congress
the
intention
to
have
set
forth
a
standard
that
is
itself
so
meaningless.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
crucial
to
the
eeoc's
position
is
the
repeated
statement
that
my
opponent
made
that
the
references
to
seniority
in
the
congressional
debates
were
always
seniority
rights.
that
is
clearly
incorrect.
senator
clark,
one
of
the
proponents
of
the
bill,
in
introducing
the
very
memorandum
that
constitutes
the
whole
of
the
legislative
history
advanced
by
respondent,
stated
that
seniority...
it
is
clear
that
the
bill
would
not
affect
seniority
at
all.
no
use
of
the
word
"rights".
senator
humphrey,
another
proponent
of
the
bill,
title
7
does
not--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--it
has
application
only
in
the
franks
sense
in
terms
of
remedy.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
that
is
not
the
attack
on
the
operation
and
the
method--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
statement
is
not
isolated.
there
were
many
such
statements
by
the
sponsors
intending
to
lay
to
rest
the
charge
that
seniority
would
be
adversely
affected
by
the
statute.
as
i
started
to
say,
senator
humphrey
also--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--yes,
the
repeated
congressional
concerns
that
seniority
not
be
affected,
and
the
adoption
itself
of
703(h)
as
a
method
of
assuring
that
the
repeated
statements
by
the
proponents
regarding
the
sanctity
of
the
seniority
principle
would
be
preserved.
indeed,
when
703(h)
was
before
the
senate,
senator
dirksen
said,
seniority
rights
are
in
no
way
affected
by
the
bill,
and
throughout--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--except...
to
the
extent
that
they
are
bona
fide,
and
703(h)
leaves,
as
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
and
as
justice
stevens'
questions
point
out,
and
a
determination
as
to
the
bona
fide
nature.
congress
stated
broadly,
unqualifiedly,
and
repeatedly,
they
always
were
doing
so
in
the
context
of
a
system
that
was
bona
fide,
and
703(h)
crystallized
those
views
in
an
attempt
to
deal
with
the--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--that's
correct.
there
is
not
a
word
to
indicate
any
distinction
between
when
the
seniority
system
was
adopted,
and
certainly
not
a
word
to
deal
with
the
difference
between
adoption
and
implementation.
the
essence
of
the
eeoc
position
is
that
a
post
act
system,
the
implementations
of
that
post
act
system
are
protected
under
703(h),
so
that
703(h)
has
application
to
post
act
systems,
and
that
is
why
it
is
so
fundamentally
at
war
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
it
creates
a
different
standard,
your
honor.
they
are
prepared
to
concede
that
the
implementation
of
a
post
act
system,
they
would
be
required
to
show--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--intention
to
discriminate,
but
they
say...
and
that
is
a
post
act
system...
but
they
say
the
adoption
of
that
very
system,
all
they
had
to
do
would
be
to
show
the
griggs
standard.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
703(h)
indicates
a
clear
congressional
desire--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--that
is
not
a
reading
of
the
statute
that
bears
any
support
in
the
legislative
history,
and
it
is
a
strained,
an
illusory
reading,
as
we
showed.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
it
is
not
one
that
is
supported
by
the
full
context
of
the
legislative
consideration,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
reading
that
had
ever
occurred
to
the
eeoc
before,
nor
to
any
court.
that
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
this
statute.
