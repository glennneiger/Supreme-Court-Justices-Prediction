unknown
speaker
ms.
krell,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
fact
that
title
9
was
patterned
after
title
6,
and
title
6
had
an
express
provision
excluding
employment
practices
from
its
coverage,
and
a
similar
section
proposed
in
title
9
was
removed?
unknown
speaker
ms.
krell,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
the
case
is
moot
in
view
of
the
new
attitude
taken
by
the
department.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
a
conflict
between
the
two
departments
of
government.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
mentioned
these
16
court
opinions.
the
fifth
circuit
is
out
of
line
with
some
of
the
others,
is
it
not,
in
the
dougherty
case?
unknown
speaker
i
would
appreciate
your
comments
on
dougherty.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
happy
with
that
kind
of
a
resolution?
unknown
speaker
at
all?
unknown
speaker
even
though
an
employee
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
students
who
are
protected
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
in
essence
the
fifth
circuit's
approach?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
you
would
be
content
with
the
more
narrow
one
that
you
have
just
described,
the
more
narrow
than
the
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
department's
position...
i
am
sure
we
will
learn
what
it
is...
but
it
would
accept
a
regulation
that
was
just
program
oriented.
unknown
speaker
ms.
krell,
did
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
the
secretary
could
not
withdraw
these
regulations
without
the
approval
of
the
justice
department?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
new
regulations
that
are
proposed
haven't
gone
into
effect.
the
old
ones
are
still
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
and
they
cannot
be
withdrawn
by
the
secretary,
notwithstanding
his
change
of
view.
unknown
speaker
without
the
approval--
unknown
speaker
--but
there
has
been
a
notice
of--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
senator
birch
bayh's
statements,
how
do
you
explain
those?
he
was
the
chief
senate
sponsor.
unknown
speaker
and
did
he
not
make
several
statements
indicating
that
he
thought
employment
was
covered?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
he
was
just
confused
about
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
why
are
plaintiffs
anxious
to
bring
themselves
under
the
coverage
of
title
9?
is
it
because
of
the
potential
to
cut
off
federal
funds
to
the
employing
agency?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
remedies
are
available
under
other
programs
like
title
7,
i
just
wondered
why
you
thought
plaintiffs
would
be
anxious
to
come
under
this--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
are
more
familiar
with
it,
perhaps,
since
you
have
been
working
on
this
particular
problem.
is
there
any
other
federal
program
in
which
any
of
these
plaintiffs
were
involved
that
would
have
resulted
in
the
cutoff
of
federal
funds
if
they
were
successful?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
started
this
lawsuit,
didn't
you?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
was
that
at
the
request
of
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
that...
had
the
secretary
wanted
to
withdraw
them,
that
could
not
be
done
without--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
by
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
that
by
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
the
position
of
the
department
that
the
secretary
had
no
discretion
with
respect
to
issuing
regulations?
is
it
you
view
that
the
statute
compelled
him
to
take
the
position
that
the
former
secretary
took
in
these
regulations?
unknown
speaker
despite
the
fact
that,
what,
a
dozen
courts
have
held
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
before
you
move
to
that,
mr.
solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--i
have
made
this
observation
from
this
bench
before.
but
can
you
tell
me
why
executive
branches
of
government
don't
get
their
act
together
before
they
go
into
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
it
is
very
unseemly,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
public
statements,
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
am
talking
about
the
formality
that
results
in
two
major
departments
of
government
having
different
views
and
bringing
the
issue
to
this
court
to
resolve.
unknown
speaker
that
is
only
because
she
objected
to
the
position
of
the
secretary
of
education.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
said
in
your
response
to
justice
powell
that
the
act
to
which
reference
was
made,
the
decision
in
your
department,
and
that
of
the
attorney
general,
is
that
you
have
got
your
act
together.
right
or
wrong,
you
now
have
your
act
together.
unknown
speaker
i
am
speaking
of
the
government
when
i
say,
you
have
the
act
together.
unknown
speaker
which
may
be
right
or
which
may
be
wrong.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
you
are
the
spokesman
for
the
united
states
government.
unknown
speaker
whether
you
like
it
or
not.
unknown
speaker
you
have
also
got
another
arrow
here,
that
the
law,
the
executive
order,
even
if
you
weren't
the
exclusive
litigator
for
the
united
states,
the
executive
order
puts
the
authority
under
this
statute
in
the
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
feel
the
legislative
history
is
crystal
clear.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interpose
a
question
there?
i
guess
it
is
subsequent
to
the
act's
enactment
there
are
some
statements
by
congressman
o'hara.
unknown
speaker
now,
does
the
legislative
history
tell
us
what
the
congressman's
views
were
on
the
substantive
issue
that
separated
the
two
houses?
unknown
speaker
congressman
o'hara's,
prior
to
the
conference--
unknown
speaker
--it
does
not?
unknown
speaker
we
know
the
position
of
the
house
though.
the
position
of
the
house
was
contrary
to
your
position.
unknown
speaker
the
position
of
the
senate
was--
unknown
speaker
--general
lee,
is
there
or
more
properly
was
there
when
senator
bayh
spoke
a
recognized
definition
of
the
word
"program"?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
there
was...
you
referred
to
institutions,
protecting
against
sex
discrimination
in
educational
institutions.
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
says
programs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
mentioned
title
7.
there
are
two
individuals
who
initiated
the
complaints
that
brought
about
this
action.
would
they
have
had
relief
available
under
title
7?
unknown
speaker
and
under
title
9
is
there
any
administrative
procedure
remotely
equal
to
or
comparable
to
the
eeo
procedure
that
is
spelled
out
in
great
detail?
unknown
speaker
development
where?
unknown
speaker
in
one
of
the
footnotes
to
your
brief,
you
say
the
department
of
education
had
little
or
no
experience
with
respect
to
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
you
want
it
to
take
over
an
area
in
which
eeoc
has
had
more
than
a
little.
unknown
speaker
is
it
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
congress
to
enact
parallel
legislation
that
gives
options
to
employees
in
some
instances
with
elaborate
procedure
and
others
with
none?
unknown
speaker
this
case
was
started...
at
least
one
of
these
cases
was
started
by
the
school
board.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question
of
private
causes
of
action
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor...
yes,
i
wanted
to
hear
your
second
proposition.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
i
see
your
yellow
light
is
on,
and
i
am
very
concerned
about
one
aspect
of
the
case
and
your
views
on
it.
the
fact
that
the
act
is
framed
in
terms
of
programs
and
the
view
of
at
least
one
court
that
the
regulations
to
be
valid
must
address
themselves
to
programs,
and
not
in
the
broad
general
terms
of
these
regulations.
would
you
address
that,
please?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit's
reading
of
the
regulation
necessarily,
but
you
agree
with
its
rationale.
unknown
speaker
and
when
you
say
it
isn't
before
the
court,
are
you
indicating
that
the
court
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
address
itself
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
interesting
concession
on
your
part,
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
about
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
your
brief
almost
says,
at
least.
unknown
speaker
that
was
after
the
thing
had
been
passed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
unknown
speaker
again,
now,
confining
ourselves
to
pre
enactment
legislative
history--
unknown
speaker
--was
there
any
discussion
of
the
drafting
error
rationale
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
those
i
know
are
later,
and
there
is
nothing
else
about
that
drafting
problem
before?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
consistent
with
your
perception
of
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
the
plain
language,
no
ambiguity,
none
whatever?
unknown
speaker
it
might
depend
on
which
person.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
right,
mr.
solicitor
general.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
eeoc's
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
the
particular
employers
as
to
which
eeoc
has
great
expertise?
unknown
speaker
the
issue
here
is
employment,
not
education.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
eeoc
would
not
be
adequate
to
deal
with
a
similar
claim
in
the
laboratories
of
dupont
because
they
don't
know
anything
about
chemistry
and
how
laboratories
operate?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
ms.
hodgson,
i
gather
that
the
remedy
would...
if
you
prevail
on
the
discrimination
claim
under
either
9
or
7,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
remedy?
unknown
speaker
ultimately,
what
was
she
seeking,
reinstatement?
unknown
speaker
and
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
and
under
either
7
or
9,
that
is
what
she
might
expect
if
she
prevailed?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
suggest
that
there
be
a
different
remedy
under
title
9
if
she
prevailed
there
than
there
would
under
title
7
if
she
prevailed
there.
unknown
speaker
there
might
be?
unknown
speaker
in
what
sense
a
more
complete
remedy?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
all
that
the
teacher
would
be,
i
gather,
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
isn't
it?
