ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
the
private
respondent
in
this
case,
linda
potz.
three
years
ago,
after
an
investigation,
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
found
that
the
trumbull
board
of
education
had
violated
title
9
when
it
demeaned
ms.
potz
before
her
colleagues
and
students,
when
it
asked
her
to
falsify
a
report
which
would
have
shown
unequal
services
to
female
students,
and
when
it
terminated
her
employment,
leaving
female
junior
high
school
students
without
a
female
guidance
counselor.
the
trumbull
board
of
education
complains
that
ms.
potz
has
pursued
multiple
remedies.
i
suggest
that
the
record
shows
that
some
of
her
proceedings
merely
addressed
gross
irregularities
in
the
termination
proceedings,
and
certainly
no
inference
should
be
drawn
from
those.
ms.
potz's
complaint
of
discrimination
went
in
the
very
first
instance
to
the
agency
which
has
special
expertise
concerning
education.
it
went
to
hew.
only
after
the
district
court
had
enjoined
the
title
9
employment
regulations
did
ms.
potz
resort
to
title
7.
justice
o'connor
has
expressed
interest
in
why
private
litigants
would
be
interested
in
complaining
to
hew
rather
than
to
the
eeoc.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
eeoc
has
no
special
expertise
concerning
the
education
setting.
it
has
no
particular
knowledge
of
the
ways
in
which
that
setting,
in
which
decisions
in
that
setting
may
differ.
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
suggesting,
however,
that
there
is
superior
expertise
concerning
education
with
regard
to
hew.
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
my
suggestion
is
that
the
ways
in
which
discrimination
takes
place,
the
kinds
of
choices
made
are
particularly
germane
to
an
education
setting,
and
that
an
agency
which
deals
with
educational
settings--
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
--i
think
the
eeoc's
expertise
is
probably
best
developed
with
regard
to
industry.
i
am
suggesting
only
that
there
may
be
a
superior
familiarity
of
hew,
because
it
deals
with
education
all
of
the
time.
the
other
reason
for
resort
to
hew
is
that
the
eeoc,
as
this
court
knows,
has
labored
under
an
enormous
burden
of
a
case
load
which
it
cannot
keep
up
with.
the
record
indicates
in
this
case
hew
was
able
to
come
in,
do
a
thorough
investigation,
and
come
up
with
findings
within
a
year.
that
is
a
very
substantial
difference,
and
since
this
court
has
shown
great
interest
in
the
idea
of
resolving
these
problems
at
the
administrative
level,
it
is
a
difference
of
which
note
should
be
taken.
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
it
is
unsettled
whether
the
availability
of
administrative
remedies
is
greater
under
title
9.
clearly,
there
is
a
provision
for
fund
termination.
we
do
not
urge
that
remedy--
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
--she
was
seeking
reinstatement--
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
--and
back
pay,
and--
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
--yes.
however,
the
remedies
offered
under
title
9
can
also
be
attuned
finely
to
the
perception
by
hew
that
employment
discrimination
is
having
an
impact
on
students.
it
has
been
brought
to
this
court's
attention
that
there
is
a
vast
body
of
social
science
literature
indicating
that
there
is
a
real
lesson
to
students
when
female
teachers
are
discriminated
against.
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
there
might
be
in
some
cases--
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
--a
more
complete
remedy,
depending
on
the
administrative--
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
--well,
for
instance,
the
department
of
education
might
find
that
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this
infection
of
the
school
program
it
might
want
some
extra
publicity
so
that
students
would
see
that
the
injustice
that
they
may
have
drawn
some
conclusions
from
would
be
undone.
that
would
not
be
a
typical
sort
of
remedy
under
title
7.
ms.
beverly
j.
hodgson
with
regard
to
the
teacher,
yes.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
reason
that
title
9
governs
employment
is
because
the
employment
does
have
an
effect
on
students,
and
that
that
effect
can
be
adjusted
by
the
administrative
agency
which
knows
about
that
effect.
the
present
change
of
position
by
the
administering
agency
is
not
really
germane.
the
standard
of
review
here
is
not
what
the
agency's
philosophy
is
now,
and
it
is
not
what
other
courts'
philosophy
might
have
been
as
to
an
efficient
administrative
scheme.
the
flaw
with
the
alvo,
the
romeo,
the
seattle
cases
are
all
that
these
courts
decided
to
look
into
how
they
thought
this
regulation
should
best
be
enacted,
not
according
to
the
standard
of
review
which
this
court
has
said
is
germane
to
administrative
regulations.
as
recently
as
last
month,
the
court
decided
in
federal
election
commission
versus
democratic
senatorial
campaign
commission
that
an
administrative
action
is
valid
as
long
as
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
purpose.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated,
there
was
a
statutory
purpose
here
to
avoid
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
support
discrimination.
this
court
has
so
found
in
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago,
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
title
9
was
to
keep
those
who
accept
federal
largesse
from
using
it
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
and
the
view
that
these
regulations
should
be
inspected
as
to
their
efficiency
is
simply
one
which
does
not
comport
either
with
this
recent
case
i
have
just
cited
or
with
the
mourning
case
or
the
other
precedents
from
this
court
which
show
deference
to
administrative
regulations
and
to
the
contemporaneous
view
of
the
agency
which
accepts
the
mandate
of
interpreting
the
statute.
there
is
no
confusion
by
senator
bayh
when
he
addressed
the
question.
the
division
in
his
remarks
was
not,
as
the
petitioners
suggest,
a
division
between
remedies
for
faculty
members
and
remedies
for
students.
rather,
the
division
was,
remedies
concerning
recipients
of
federal
funds
and
remedies
concerning
other
kinds
of
educational
institutions
which
did
not
receive
funds.
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
does
not
permit
any
inquiry
into
the
program
specificity
question
because
despite
ms.
potz's
effort
to
make
a
record
concerning
infection
of
the
educational
program
and
the
loss
of
equal
services
to
students,
the
district
court
enjoined
all
of
the
regulations
on
their
face,
and
that
this
is
not
therefore
an
instance
in
which
program
specificity
is
really
raised
as
an
issue
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act
were
ever
intended
to
be
the
exclusive
remedies,
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
validity
of
overlapping
remedies.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
depart
from
that
recognition
in
this
case
whatever
its
own
view
of
efficiency
might
be.
the
question
is
whether
at
the
time
of
enactment,
with
broad
language
which
contained
no
exemption
concerning
employment,
it
was
proper
for
the
department
of
hew
to
include
regulation
of
employment
because
of
its
expertise
in
that
area.
the
court
in
reviewing
other
discrimination
statutes
has
taken
note
of
departures
from
prior
models.
in
the
context
of
age
discrimination,
the
court
has
said
that
where
title
7
is
abandoned
and
different
procedures
are
engrafted,
that
difference
will
be
respected,
and
the
change
from
the
section
604
model
of
title
6
must
similarly
be
given
effect.
i
urge
then
that
the
court
affirm
what
the
second
circuit's
view
has
been,
and
i
suggest
that
the
number
of
court
decisions
is
of
nowhere
near
as
much
significance
as
the
validity
of
the
reasoning,
and
in
this
case
the
application
of
the
traditional
standard
for
judicial
review
of
administrative
actions
favors
upholding
those
regulations
as
enacted.
