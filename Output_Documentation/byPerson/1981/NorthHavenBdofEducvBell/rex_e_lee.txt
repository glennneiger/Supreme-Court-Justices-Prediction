mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
state
first,
just
briefly,
that
the
interchange,
the
exchange
that
occurred
is
correct.
the
department
of
education
has
in
fact
withdrawn
its
request
for
change
of
regulations
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
they
disagree
with
the
regulations
and
with
the
policy.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
was
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
still
has
to
get
over
the
hurdle.
ms.
krell
is
correct--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
under
the
applicable
executive
order,
it
is
the
attorney
general
that
has
the
final
authority
to
make
any
change
in
title
9
regulation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
by
statute
and
then
executive
order
implementing
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
certainly
the
statute,
justice
powell,
did
not
require
all
of
the
details
of
the
former
regulations,
but
insofar
as
employment
coverage
is
concerned,
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
there
are
three...
the
reason
that
those
dozen
courts
are
so
wrong
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
this
morning
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
three
most
salient
of
those
as
to
why
it
is
that
those
courts
were
wrong.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
exactly
correct,
and
while
we
live
in
the
society
that
we
live
in,
with
the
privileges
of
the
first
amendment
which
are
permitted,
there
is
certainly
nothing
that
can
be
done
about
public
statements
that
are
made,
but
that
is
the
very
reason
for
the
exclusive
litigating--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
the
only
view
that
is
being
presented
to
this
court
is
the
view
that
i
am
about
to
espouse.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
because
of
the
fact
that
as
an
officer
of
this
court
with
peculiar
responsibilities
to
this
court
to
advise
as
to
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
in
1972
when
it
passed
these
amendments,
we
are
more
than
just
another
lawyer
representing
another
client.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
have
always
had
our
act
together.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
this
case
simply
shows
that
indeed
for
exclusive
litigating
authority
in
the
department
of
justice.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
this
case
it
happens
to
be
right.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
exactly
right.
now,
with
my
authority
adequately
sustained,
i
would
like
to
get
on
to
why
it
is--
0
[generallaughter.]
--that
we
are
right
in
this
case.
i
turn
first
to
the
language.
on
its
face,
it
clearly
includes
employment.
it
says
no
person
shall
be
subjected
to
discrimination,
and
person
clearly
includes
employment.
title
9's
kinship
to
title
6
has
been
noted.
title
6
does
contain
the
same
language.
title
6
does
not
pertain
to
employment,
but
title
6
contains
this
express
disclaimer.
title
9
does
not.
i
recognize
the
argument
that
my
opponents
have
made
that
604
in
title
6
was
just
there
for
purposes
of
clarification.
i
will
simply
refer
to
pages
34
and
35
by
brief,
and
note
that
that
issue
is
far
from
clear.
but
analysis
should
not
tarry
there,
because
in
any
event,
even
if
it
was
only
in
the
statute
for
purposes
of
clarification,
once
you
put
a
604
clarifier
onto
a
601
basic
prohibition,
then
any
future
congress
that
wants
to
prohibit
discrimination
by
using
the
601
prototype
needs
to
use
the
clarifier
with
it,
because
once
the
clarifier
has
been
used,
the
defect
becomes
a
procedure
of
art,
if
you
will,
and
it
must
be
used
if
the
purpose
is
to
exclude
employment.
the
case
here
is,
of
course,
much
stronger,
because
a
section
604
counterpart
was
included
by
the
house
version
of
the
1972
act
and
taken
out
in
conference.
the
legislative
history
concerning
the
reason
for
that
deletion
is
short,
but
equally
clear.
the
conference
report
devotes
two
sentences
to
the
matter.
the
first
sentence
describes
the
difference
between
the
house
and
senate
version,
and
the
second
sentence
states
simply,
"the
house
recedes".
now,
in
response
to
a
question
by
justice
o'connor,
there
was
suggested
a
different
reason
for
the
deletion
of
section
904
than
the
one
given
by
the
conference
report.
it
is
suggested
that
the
reason
for
that
change
was
simply
to
correct
a
drafting
mistake
because
the
bill
was
obviously
inapplicable,
or
rather,
the
disclaimer
was
obviously
inapplicable,
and
it
was,
to
other
parts
of
the
1972
amendment,
namely,
that
part
that
extended
the
coverage
of
title
9
and
the
equal
pay
act.
this
is
an
inadequate
explanation
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
receding
and
correcting
are
two
different
things.
the
conference
knew
which
it
was
doing
and
said
which
it
was
doing.
the
conference
report
does
not
say
that
the
conferees
picked
up
a
mistake,
and
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
there
even
the
slightest
hint
that
what
they
were
doing
was
to
correct
a
mistake.
the
language
that
they
used
was
the
language
that
says
that
there
was
a
substantive
difference
between
the
senate
and
the
house,
and
that
on
that
issue
it
was
the
senate
version
that
prevailed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
really
is,
justice
blackmun.
it
is
crystal
clear
if
you
read
it
against
two
perspectives.
one
of
those
perspectives
is
a
time
one.
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint...
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
whereas
from
1972...
from
1970
to
1972
there
were
four...
three
or
four
efforts,
depending
on
how
you
count,
to
include
some
kind
of
guarantee
in
the
civil
rights
laws
of
the
united
states
providing
against
discrimination
against
women
in
education,
and
much
of
the
legislative
history
that
is
quoted
from
and
that
might
imply
therefore
some
confusion
comes
from
those
earlier
efforts,
the
1970
and
the
1971
efforts.
the
legislative
history
that
really
counts
the
most
occurred
all
on
one
single
day,
and
it
consists
of
statements
by
one
senator.
the
case
probably
is
not
unique
in
this
respect,
but
it
certainly
is
distinctive.
now,
the
reason
that
the
statements
by
senator
bayh
on
that
particular
day
are
so
important
is
this.
the
version
that
eventually
prevailed
was
the
senate
version.
that
is
the
one
that
became
law.
the
senate
version
was
passed
on
the
same
day
that
it
was
introduced
by
senator
bayh
as
an
amendment
to
an
existing
senate
bill.
it
didn't
go
through
committee.
so
that
introduction,
debate,
and
final
senate
passage
all
occurred
on
the
same
day.
and
as
a
consequence,
the
views
of
senator
bayh
are
the
only
views
that
were
expressed
in
the
legislative
history,
and
his
views
really
are
the
legislative
history,
because
of
the
peculiar
way
that
this
particular
bill
was
passed.
now,
the
second--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
congressman
o'hara's?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
nothing
on
the
house
side.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now,
the
second
perspective
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
and
what
in
my
view,
justice
blackmun,
makes
it
so
crystal
clear,
is
a
distinction
that
everyone
recognizes
between
the
two
parts
of
this
particular
proposal.
senator
bayh
did
two
things
with
these
amendments.
one
was
to
propose
title
9,
which
prohibited
sex
discrimination
in
educational
institutions
receiving
federal
funds.
the
second
part
of
the
amendment
was
an
extension
of
both
title
7
and
also
the
equal
pay
act.
now,
it
is
true,
as
my
opponents
have
pointed
out,
that
some
portions
of
the
legislative
history
can
be
read
as
applicable
to
title
7
or
the
equal
pay
act,
but
there
is
simply
no
answer
to
these
two
compelling
propositions,
and
i
have
never
seen
any
answer
to
either
of
these
propositions.
the
first
is
that
nowhere
in
senator
bayh's
statements
and
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
many
statements
concerning
employment
apply
only
to
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act.
there
is
nothing
to
that
effect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
think
there
is
very
much
in...
i
don't
remember
anything,
frankly,
on
discussion
of
that
issue,
and
indeed
it
is
an
issue
that
is
not
involved,
in
our
view,
in
this
case.
it
is
going
to
be
in--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
it
is
programs,
and
it
is
program
specific
in
two
ways.
one
is
the
way
that
you
referred
to,
justice
white,
that
it
is
only
in
the
program
that
receives
the
aid
that
the
statute
reaches,
and
the
second
is
that
insofar
as
the
termination
provisions
are
concerned
it
can
only
be
with
regard
to
that
program.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
just
in
its
incipient
stages
of
development,
given
this
court's--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
given
this
court's
decision
in
cannon
that
there
is
a
private
remedy.
the
extent
and
the
nature
of
those...
of
that
private
remedy
and
the
procedures
that
would
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
and
i
think
that
is
again
outside
the
scope
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
and
it
may
very
well
be
for
those
reasons.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
apologize.
i
misunderstood
the
scope
of
the
question.
certainly
not.
and
this
court
in
the
gardner-denver
and
other
cases
has
noted
the
overlapping
of
remedies,
and
so
they
are
not
identical.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
they
both
were.
they
both
were.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
this
is
simply
not
part
of
this
case.
let
me
turn
now
second--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
what
i
want
to
hear,
too,
justice
stevens.
0
[generallaughter.]
the
second
proposition
is
that
the
congressional
record
had
three
separate
parts
of
senator
bayh's
statements
containing
at
least,
oh,
eight
or
ten
separate
references
that
are
only
consistent
with
applicability
to
title
9,
and
that
under
no
circumstances
can
fairly
be
read
as
applicable
either
to
title
7
or
to
the
equal
pay
act,
and
i
would
like
to
review
those
just
briefly.
first,
in
his
introductory
remarks,
the
senator
describes
his
amendment,
and
he
says
that
the
heart
of
this
amendment
is
a
provision
banning
sex
discrimination
in
educational
programs
receiving
federal
funds,
which
is
clearly
title
9.
that
is
not
title
7
or
the
equal
pay
act.
he
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
amendment
would
cover
such
crucial
aspects
as
admissions
procedures,
scholarships,
and
faculty
employment,
and
then
in
the
very
next
sentence
he
says
other
important
provisions
in
the
amendment
would
extend
the
equal
employment
opportunity
provisions
in
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act.
now,
they
just
can't
get
much
clearer
than
that,
that
the
heart
of
the
amendment
is
title
9,
which
covers
admissions,
student
services,
and
faculty
employment,
and
that
other
important
provisions
extend
to
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
we
agree,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
programs
that
the...
that
this
is
a
program
specific
statute.
there
is
some
question,
frankly,
as
to
whether
these
regulations
are
or
are
not
program
specific.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
you
can
make
an
argument
that
they
are
program
specific.
it
is
very
likely
after
this
case
is
over
that
the
department
of
education
will
want
to
have
another
look
at
that
issue,
and
of
course
on
that
issue
we
agree
with
the
department
of
education.
in
any
event,
it
is
very
clear
because
of
the
posture
of
this
case
that
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
is
a
very
fine
opinion.
the
only
thing
that
they
did
wrong
was
just
throwing
out
all
the
regulations.
other
than
that,
they
are
dead
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
exactly.
i
think
it
almost
would
partake
of
an
advisory
opinion.
certainly
you
don't
want
to
consider
it
without
a
record
in
this
case
as
to
what
is
a
program.
that
will
be
a
difficult
enough
issue,
and
i
suspect
that
we
may
be
back
again
on
that
issue
at
some
future
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that
is
our
view.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
to
the
extent
it
doesn't
say
that
it
should
have.
the
second
part
of
the
legislative
history
that
is
so
persuasive
is
senator
bayh's
part
by
part
analysis.
let
me
simply
say
this
in
the
interest
of
time,
that
the
first
section
of
that
summary
clearly
applies
to
title
9.
you
read
it,
there
is
no
way
that
it
applies
to
anything
other
than
title
9.
and
the
second
part
clearly
applies
to
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act.
and
he
says
with
regard
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
was
not,
and
that
is
the
crucial
difference.
senator
bayh
also
submitted
a
statement
after
it
had
passed.
and
i
don't
give
that
one
any
more
credence
than
congressman
o'hara.
those
don't
count.
this
was
on
the
senate
floor
february
28,
1972,
the
day
that
everything
happened
in
connection
with
the
statute,
and
he
said,
this
portion
of
the
amendment
covers
discrimination
in
all
areas
where
abuse
has
been
mentioned,
employment
practices
for
faculty
and
administrators,
scholarship
aid,
and
admissions.
i
do
not
have
time
to
cover
the
exchange
between
senator
bayh
and
senator
pell,
but
it
is
equally
persuasive.
at
all
points
it
becomes
overwhelmingly
persuasive
that
the
congress
that
passed
the
education
amendments
of
1972,
a
decade
ago,
regardless
of
what
is
good
policy,
regardless
of
what
anyone
might
think
today,
intended
that
title
9's
prohibition
against
sex
discrimination
in
programs
that
receive
federal
financial
aid
apply
not
only
to
student
matters
but
also
to
employment.
it
is
true
that
there
are
references
to
the
legislative
history
that
apply
to
students.
of
course
there
are.
that
is
covered
also.
of
course
there
are
references
to
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act.
but
there
are
a
number
of
references,
too
many
to
be
ignored,
that
can
only
apply
to
employment
discrimination.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
which
is
the
only
thing
that
is
relevant.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
you
have
two
sentences,
and
two
sentences
only.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
if
you
read
it
on
its
face
without
comparing
it
to
title
6,
it
is
very
plain.
it
says
no
person
shall
be
subject
to
discrimination.
the
ambiguity
comes
in
in
the
comparison
to
section
6,
and
then
you
have
to
make
the
comparison
to
section
6,
and
then
that
gets
you
into
the
604,
904
counterpart
with
its
attendant
legislative
history.
mr.
rex
