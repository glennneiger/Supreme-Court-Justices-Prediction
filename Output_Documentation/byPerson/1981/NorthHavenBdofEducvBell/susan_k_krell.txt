ms.
susan
k.
krell
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
regulations
promulgated
by
the
then
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
now
the
department
of
education,
pursuant
to
sections
901
and
902
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972.
it
is
the
petitioners'
position
that
section
901
was
drafted
with
an
unmistakable
focus
on
the
beneficiaries
of
federal
financial
assistance
and
not
as
a
general
prohibition
on
discriminatory
conduct
by
recipients
of
such
federal
financial
assistance,
and
thus
the
regulations
in
question
are
invalid.
i
will
briefly
present
the
facts
in
the
north
haven
case,
and
counsel
for
trumbull
will
address
the
facts
in
that
case.
the
legal
issues
are
the
same.
the
north
haven
case
arose
when
a
former
teacher
who
had
quit
her
job
applied
for
an
open
position
and
a
different
female
applicant
was
hired.
the
rejected
applicant
filed
charges
of
sex
discrimination
in
employment
with
the
eeoc
and
with
hew.
she
also
filed
a
federal
court
suit
under
title
7
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
under
43
us
code
1983,
and
under
title
9.
when
hew
attempted
to
investigate
her
charge,
the
board
of
education
pointed
out
that
it
believed
hew
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
general
employment
practices,
and
that
several
district
courts
had
so
found.
hew,
however,
persisted,
thus
necessitating
the
north
haven
board
filing
a
suit
in
district
court
in
connecticut.
judge
ellen
b.
burns
granted
north
haven's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
held
the
regulations
in
question
void,
invalid,
and
of
no
effect
whatsoever,
and
granted
an
injunction
prohibiting
further
investigation
by
hew.
the
trumbull
litigation
followed
a
similar
path,
and
the
department
of
justice
appealed
both
cases
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
where
they
were
consolidated.
the
cases
were
held
in
abeyance
pending
a
decision
by
this
court
on
three
petitions
for
writs
of
certiorari
filed
by
justice
department
from
three
court
of
appeals
decisions
that,
similar
to
judge
ellen
burns'
decision,
had
held
the
regulations
invalid.
when
those
petitions
were
denied,
the
cases
were
reactivated
and
heard
by
the
second
circuit.
at
that
time
there
were
15
court
decisions
in
various
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals,
all
holding
these
regulations
invalid.
the
second
circuit,
however,
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
upheld
the
validity
of
those
regulations.
it
is
our
position
that
an
analysis
of
the
legislative
scheme
of
title
9
in
its
entirety,
of
the
statutory
language
of
sections
901
and
902,
and
the
legislative
history
all
establish
that
employees
in
general
are
not
among
the
class
protected
by
section
901.
the
department
of
education
has
recently
indicated
its
agreement
with
that
position.
the
genesis
of
what
became
title
9
were
hearings,
extensive
hearings
held
before
the
house
of
representatives
in
1970,
and
at
that
time
two
problems
were
brought
to
its
attention.
one
was
sex
discrimination
in
employment
against
women
employed
in
educational
institutions,
and
at
that
time
title
7
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
explicitly
excluded
women...
excluded
educational
institutions
from
its
parameters.
the
equal
pay
act
at
that
time
excluded
people
in
positions
of
executive,
professional,
and
academic.
that
would
also
work
to
the
detriment
of
women
faculty
members
of
educational
institutions.
so,
thus
there
was
one
very
special
problem
of
women
employees
of
educational
institutions
who
were
victims
of
sex
discrimination
and
who
were
not
protected
by
title
7
of
the
equal
pay
act.
another
problem
that
was
brought
to
congress's
attention
was
the
problem
of
student
beneficiaries
who
were
also
or
might
also
be
victims
of
sex
discrimination
and
who
were
not
protected
by
section
601
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
a
section
that
protected
beneficiaries
of
federal
financial
assistance
from
race,
color,
or
national
origin
discrimination,
but
did
not
prohibit
sex
discrimination.
growing
out
of
these
hearings
was
the
bill
that
became
title
9,
which
very
explicitly
addressed
the
problem
of
women
employees
by
amending
title
7
to
remove
that
exemption
for
employees
of
educational
institutions,
and
by
amending
the
equal
pay
act
to
remove
the
exemption
for
academic,
professional,
and
executive
positions.
so,
employees
of
educational
institutions
now
have
federal
forums,
federal
agencies
that
could
investigate
their
claims
and
could
go
into
federal
court
pursuant
to
those
statutes.
the
problems
of
student
beneficiaries
were
addressed
in
what
became
section
901
of
title
9.
the
section
that
was
enacted
prohibited
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
in
educational
programs
or
activities.
that
section
901
language
was
chosen
over
other
proposals
that
had
been
suggested
to
congress.
one
proposal
by
the
department
of
justice
had
suggested
that
instead
of
amending
title
7
in
the
equal
pay
act
to
protect
employees
of
educational
institutions,
hew
should
be
given
that
jurisdiction,
and
it
proposed
what
would
have
been
comparable
to
section
901(a),
a
general
prohibition
against
discrimination
of
beneficiaries,
and
explicitly
would
have
given
jurisdiction
over
employment
to
hew.
that
proposal,
however,
was
not
adopted.
similarly,
senator
mcgovern
had
proposed
a
bill
that
would
have
first
banned
general
discrimination
against
beneficiaries
in
educational
programs,
and
again
would
have
explicitly
covered
employment.
those
proposals
were
not
adopted.
what
was
adopted
was
the
scheme
to
protect
employees
under
title
7
in
the
equal
pay
act,
and
to
protect
student
beneficiaries
under
section
901.
the
statute
then
is
clearly
addressed
to
those
beneficiaries.
the
exceptions
to
section
901
are
also
all
addressed
to
the
student
relationship.
they
address
admissions
to
educational
institutions,
certain
programs
or
activities
that
would
affect
students,
or
exempt
institutions
in
their
entirety.
nothing
related
to
employment
is
under
section
901.
when
congress
does
address
employment,
it
has
put
certain
exceptions
into
the
statute.
title
7,
for
example,
makes
an
exception
for
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
or
for
a
national
security
exemption.
those
exceptions
were
missing
from
the
section
901
exceptions,
further
indication
that
employment
was
not
covered
in
that
general
prohibition
to
protect
students.
the
hew
regulations
in
question,
however,
go
much
further
than
the
statutory
language.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
title
9
in
its
entirety
did
address
employment.
sections
906
and
908
of
title
9
were
the
sections
that
amended
title
7
and
amended
the
equal
pay
act.
to
have
a
section
904
in
it
prohibiting
agency
action
if
there
was
employment
discrimination
would
have
been
inconsistent.
so
therefore
it
was
eliminated
in
congress.
but
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
section
604
is
not
an
exclusion
from
coverage
under
section
601.
it
was
instead
a
clarification
of
what
senator
humphrey
had
said
had
always
been
intended
by
the
language
of
section
601
on
which
section
901
was
patterned.
further,
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
representative
o'hara
had
said
that
what
they
had
done
in
preparing
title
9
was
take
a
copy
of
title
6
and
just
cut
and
paste
it,
mark
out
section
601
and
make
901,
mark
out
604
and
make
904,
but
when
you
took
that
and
added
to
it
the
amendments
to
title
7
in
the
equal
pay
act,
it
made
no
sense
whatsoever,
and
thus
it
was
dropped
out.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not,
because
the
justice
department
apparently
has
not
gone
along
with
the
proposal
of
the
department
of
education.
president
carter
had
delegated
his
authority
that
was
given
to
him
under
section
902
to
approve
the
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
901
to
the
attorney
general,
and
when
the
department
of
education
had
proposed
a
revision
of
the
regulations
along
the
lines
we
have
been
discussing,
apparently
that
was
not
agreed
to
by
justice,
because
right
after
we
saw
that
letter,
we
got
the
justice
department's
brief,
which
indicates
it
intends
to
pursue
this
matter.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
yes,
apparently
we
do.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
yes.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
the
fifth
circuit
holds
the
regulations
invalid
as
written
because
they
are
not
program
specific,
and
they
are
not
directed
to
the
employees
in
certain
programs
receiving
federal
financial
assistance,
but
rather
are
broader,
and
would
just
cover
all
employees
conducted
by
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
no,
your
honor,
because
we
think
employment
was
not
intended
to
be
covered
by
section
601.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
right.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
in
those
very
narrow
circumstances
where
the
discrimination
against
the
employees
is
so
widespread
that
the
students
are
precluded
from
having
a
non
discriminatory
environment,
where
the
students
cannot
operate
in
a
non
discriminatory
educational
institution,
then
to
remedy
the
discrimination
against
students,
a
remedy
or
some
solution
to
the
problem
of
employment
discrimination
might
have
to
be
addressed.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
no,
i
think
they
went
further
than
that,
because
they
did
not
limit
it
to
cases
where
the
discrimination
against
employees
was
wide
ranging
throughout
an
entire
educational
institution.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
where
employment
in
general
is
not
covered,
but
only
in
specific
instances
where
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
students,
in
those
circumstances,
yes.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
i
believe
the
department
said
it
would
favor
regulations
where
there
was
a
clear
nexus
established
between
discrimination
against
the
employees
and
discrimination
against
the
students.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
right.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
the
old
regulations
are
still
in
effect.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
right.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
of
the
attorney
general.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
it
has
not
been
published,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
k.
krell
we
saw
it
in
the
daily
labor
report.
we
do
not
know
what
the
regulations
themselves
say.
what
hew
did
in
the
regulations
was
go
much
further
than
the
statutory
language
chosen,
and
they
attempted
to
rewrite
the
statutory
scheme
by
means
of
regulations,
which
they
cannot
do.
they
very
explicitly
put
into
the
very
first
regulation
in
question
that
general
prohibition
on
employment
discrimination,
which
had
been
rejected
by
congress.
they
further,
recognizing
that
if
employment
was
to
be
covered,
there
were
certain
situations
in
which
there
had
to
be
exceptions,
put
in
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
into
the
regulations,
which
had
also
been
missing
from
the
statutory
language.
so
i
think
the
regulations
in
question
go
much
further
than
that
which
was
intended
by
congress,
and
as
such
they
must
be
declared
invalid
by
this
court.
