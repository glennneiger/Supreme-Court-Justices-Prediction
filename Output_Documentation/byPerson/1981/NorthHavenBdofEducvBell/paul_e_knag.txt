mr.
paul
e.
knag
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
the
trumbull
board
of
education.
after
the
trumbull
board
of
education
declined
to
renew
the
contract
of
a
non
tenured
guidance
counselor,
linda
potz,
ms.
potz
commenced
seven
different
actions
and
proceedings
in
various
forums,
including
a
claim
under
the
subpart
e
regulations
promulgated
by
hew
under
title
9,
and
so,
we
too
commenced
an
action
seeking
to
declare
the
subpart
e
regulations
to
be
invalid.
ms.
krell
has
described
how
the
structure
of
the
statute
shows
clearly
an
intent
by
congress
to
regulate
employment
by
its
amendments
to
the
equal
pay
act,
and
title
7,
and
on
the
other
hand
to
address
beneficiaries
by
section
901,
and
that
analysis
is
strongly
buttressed
by
an
analysis
of
the
derivation
and
legislative
history
of
this
section.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
cannon,
section
601
was
the
basis
of
section
901.
title
9
was
derived
from
title
6.
and
when
president
kennedy
first
proposed
title
6
in
1963,
he
proposed
a
title
6
which
would
have
covered
employment
expressly.
however,
the
committee
later
deleted
that
language,
and
noted
that
employment
was
now
being
covered
under
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
once
that
coverage
of
employment
was
deleted
from
title
6,
both
the
floor
leaders
and
the
justice
department,
which
was
the
principal
proponent
of
the
legislation,
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
clear
the
intention
that
title
7...
title
6
was
generally
not
intended
to
cover
employment.
for
example,
a
justice
department
memorandum
stated,
"the
mere
fact
that
an
aid
recipient
violated
title
7
would
not
itself
warrant
termination
of
aid.
"
"moreover,
the
agency
administering
the
aid
would
not
adopt
a
non
discrimination
in
employment
provision
in
connection
with
its
aid
program
unless
assistance
to
employment
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
program.
"
as
ms.
krell
pointed
out,
this
all
occurred
before
the
section
604
language
was
ever
added
to
the
statute
and
when
they
did
add
section
604
to
the
statute,
senator
humphrey
went
out
of
his
way
to
make
clear
that
"we
have
expressed
in
specific
language
what
has
always
been
intended.
"
in
other
words,
section
604
did
not
change
the
meaning
of
section
601.
mr.
paul
e.
knag
that's
right.
mr.
paul
e.
knag
senator
bayh
made
a
number
of
statements,
and
those
included,
first
of
all,
the
statement
that
title
6
and
title
9
were
identical,
the
statement
that
section
901
applied
to
beneficiaries
of
federal
funds,
and
also--
mr.
paul
e.
knag
--that
is
one
interpretation,
and
that
is
the
interpretation
that
was
adopted,
in
effect,
by
most
of
the
courts
which
considered
his
remarks.
but
there
is
another
possible
explanation,
and
that
is,
as
ms.
krell
noted,
we
recognize
that
under
certain
circumstances
where,
for
example,
in
order
to
effectuate
a
desegregation
decree
you
need
to
have
provisions
concerning
faculty
assignment.
title
6
did
cover
employment,
and
so
we
agree
that
in
certain
circumstances
title
9
does
cover
employment.
but
nowhere
in
senator
bayh's
remarks
is
there
any
statement
that
he
intended
to
provide
more
coverage
in
the
area
of
sex
discrimination
than
in
the
area
of
race
discrimination.
mr.
paul
e.
knag
i
don't
think
so.
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
gone
out
of
her
way
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
threat
of
a
cutoff
of
federal
funds
in
this
case.
it
would
certainly
make
no
sense
to
cut
off
school
lunch
funds,
because--
mr.
paul
e.
knag
--unfortunately,
in
this
area,
justice
o'connor,
we
have
been
confronted
with
a
reductio
ad
absurdium
of
the
doctrine
of
overlapping
remedies,
and
it
becomes
a
test
of
wills,
a
test
of
endurance
to
get
through
to
the
end
of
one
of
these
cases.
mr.
paul
e.
knag
the
records
don't
show
that
either
plaintiff
were
engaged
in
any
federal
program,
and
our
complaint
is
that
hew
went
in
and
investigated
these
matters
without
even
inquiring
on
that
subject,
because
that
is
what
the
regulations
say.
it
just
makes
no
sense
to
construe
this
statute,
title
9,
as
authorizing
the
cutoff
of
funds
for
students
in
circumstances
which
weren't
authorized
in
title
6,
and
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
say
that
it
is
a
travesty
of
the
judicial
process
when
in
order
to
establish
that
it
properly
discharged
a
guidance
counselor
or
failed
to
renew
a
guidance
counselor's
contract,
a
school
board
like
this
has
to
go
through
seven
different
lawsuits
and
claims
and
proceedings.
mr.
paul
e.
knag
we
certainly
did,
but
we
had
a
number
of
cases
that
were
far
more
advanced
that
were,
we
thought,
headed
to
this
supreme
court,
and
we
pleaded
with
the
department
of
education
to
hold
off
pending
resolution
of
this
issue,
and
they
declined
to
do
that.
they
said,
we
are
only
going
to
follow
these
cases
in
the
districts
and
circuits
where
they
have
been
rendered,
and
that
is
why
we
needed
to
proceed.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
e.
knag
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
correct
several
things
that
were
said.
first
of
all,
it
was
suggested
that
back
pay
is
awardable
under
title
9.
i
would
simply
point
out,
although
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
several
courts
have
now
held
that
damages
are
not
awardable
under
title
9.
i
would
also
like
to
get
to
the
statements
by
the
solicitor
general
concerning
his
two
big
points
about
why
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
intended
to
cover
employment
under
section
901.
now,
the
fact
is
that
senator
bayh
doesn't
state
one
way
or
the
other
whether
he
intended
employment
to
be
covered
exclusively
under
title
7
and
the
equal
pay
act.
the
fact
is
also
that
the
solicitor
general
made
an
error
when
he
was
quoting
from
the
legislative
history.
at
one
point
he
referred
to
a
statement
by
senator
bayh
referring
to
coverage
of
employment
discrimination,
which
he
said
must
refer
to
section
901.
we
don't
think
it
must
refer
to
section
901.
but
then
he
quoted
what
he
said
was
the
next
sentence.
well,
the
fact
is
that
he
didn't
quote
the
next
sentence.
the
very
next
sentence
talked
about
the
parallelism
between
title
6
and
title
9,
and
similarly,
the
other
statement
that
he
specifically
referred
to
here
talks
about
employment
discrimination,
and
then
in
the
very
next
sentence,
again
in
the
very
next
sentence
talks
about
the
parallelism
to
title
6.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
statement
that
he
is
referring
to,
here
it
is.
it
has
got
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
words
in
this
first
part
of
the
statement.
there
are
only
six
words
that
just
mention
employment
discrimination.
and
so
the
focus
clearly
of
this
part
is
on
student
discrimination,
and
the
way
to
reconcile
that
passing
reference
to
employment
discrimination
if
you
construe
it
to
refer
to
section
901
is
that
he
intended
that
it
would
be
covered
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
covered
under
title
6.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
the
secretary
of
education
is
proposing
to
do,
based
on
his
letter
to
the
attorney
general,
and
we
think
this
court
should
declare
the
regulations
as
presently
written
invalid,
because
it
doesn't
contain
that
nexus
requirement
that
the
secretary
is
imposing...
is
proposing,
and
then
allow
the
secretary
to
amend
his
regulations
to
conform
them
to
the
statute.
