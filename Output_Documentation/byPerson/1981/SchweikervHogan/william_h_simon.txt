mr.
william
h.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
congress
has
required
a
state
medicaid
program
to
apply
a
lower
subsistence
standard
to
a
group
of
indigent,
aged
and
disabled
people
who
do
not
depend
on
public
assistance,
lower
than
it
applies
to
public
assistance
recipients.
and
if
so,
whether
it
is
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
so.
now
let
me
begin
by
responding
to
the
question
which
justice
rehnquist
raised.
we
do
not
challenge
the
ability
of
a
state
to
determine
eligibility
on
the
basis
of
gross
income.
we
do
not
challenge
the
ability
of
congress
or
a
state
to
draw
eligibility
conditions
on
the
basis
of
broad,
general
characteristics.
but
that
is
not
the
way
this
program
worked.
the
classification
involved
in
this
program
is
not
a
broad,
general,
overbroad
characteristic.
massachusetts
makes
a
precise
determination
of
the
impact
of
medical
expenses
on
financial
need.
it
does
identify
those
members
of
the
appellee
class
who
are
identically
situation
to
ssi
recipients
by
considering
the
additional
factor
of
medical
expenses.
this
case
is
thus
radically
unlike
the
cases
such
as
fullington,
for
instance,
or
weinberger
vs.
salfi
where
the
cases
upheld
over-broad
classifications
on
the
grounds
of
administrative
convenience
of
administrative
simplicity
on
the
theory
that
a
state
need
not
consider
every
factor
bearing
on
need.
a
program
has
no
obligation
to
identify
all
the
people
who
are
identically
situated
in
terms
of
the
program's
purposes.
mr.
william
h.
simon
it
is
necessary...
both
levels
that
apply
here,
your
honor,
are
massachusetts
levels.
massachusetts
sets
the
ssi
level
and
it
sets
the
medically
needy
level,
although
the
medically
level
is
at
the
4/3
cap.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
it
could
be
applied
in
any
state
which
had
a
medically
needy
program
in
which
the
4/3
maximum
was
above
the
ssi
level.
that
is
true
in
the
majority
of
medically
needy
states.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
reason.
the
reason
is,
of
course,
that
congress
cannot
authorize,
through
the
use
of
its
fiscal
power,
a
state
to
do
something
which
congress
could
not
do
itself.
i
do
not
think
there
is
the
same
rule...
if
congress
itself
had
applied
two
separate,
radically
different
standards
of
needs
to
two
identically
situated
classes,
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
here
congress
is
using
its
fiscal
power
to
force
some
states
to
set
its...
to
treat
one
class
differently
in
a
way
that
congress
could
not,
itself.
now,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
statutory
argument.
as
it
turns
out,
the
statutory
argument
and
the
constitutional
arguments
are
closely
entwined.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
to
the
court
the
nature
of
the
classification
that
is
at
stake
here.
as
mr.
jones
concedes,
massachusetts
covers
two
groups
of
indigent,
aged
and
disabled
people
who
are
identically
situated
in
terms
of
the
same
categorical
criteria
of
age
and
disability.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
the
case,
your
honor,
if
indigents
is
measured
as
that
program
measures
indigents
and--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--i
am
not
sure
which
statutory
classification
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
william
h.
simon
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
medically
needy...
the
distinctive
feature
of
the
medically
needy
program
is
that
income
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
income...
gross
income
after
medical
expenses.
that
is,
the
way
it
works
is
this:
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
has
income
in
excess
of
the
eligibility
standards,
the
state
then
considers
the
individual's
medical
expenses.
to
the
extent
that
the
individual's
medical
expenses
reduce
his
income
below
the
public
assistance
standard
or
the
medically
needy
standard,
the
individual
is
then
entitled
to
medicaid
for
medical
expenses,
for
which
any
remaining
excess
income
is
insufficient.
the
individual
spends
the
excess
income
for
his
or
her
own
medical
expenses,
receives
medicaid
for
only
those
remaining
expenses.
now,
the
effect
of
that,
if
the
medically
needy
standards
were
set
at
the
same
level
as
the
ssi
standard,
would
be
to
precisely
equalize
the
treatment
of
these
two
groups
of
aged
and
disabled
people.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
unlikely
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
all
members
of
the
class
are
aged
and
disabled,
and
certainly,
the
two
named
plaintiffs
have
permanent
continuing
medical
need,
and
in
view
of
the
types
of
expenditures
for
which
medicaid
tends
to
pay,
makes
it
also
seem
unlikely.
for
instance,
70
%
of
medicaid
expenditures
are
for
nursing
home
care,
which
tends
to
be
a
very
long-term
affair.
in
any
event,
it
is
also
the
case
that
the
class
of
ssi
recipients
fluctuates,
too,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
class
fluctuates
anymore
radically
than
the
class
of
ssi
recipients.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
order
to
qualify
as
medically
needy,
the
applicant
must
satisfy
an
asset
requirement
which
in
this
case
would
be
$2000.
so
there
are
no
millionaires
getting--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--no,
we
do
not
challenge
that
at
all,
your
honor.
we
think
congress--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
position
in
fact
is
quite
typical
of
the
situation
in
most
of
the
welfare
cases
this
court
has
considered
in
the
equal
protection
context.
it
is
always
the
case
that
welfare
benefits
are
optional.
on
the
other
hand,
all
of
this
court's
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
once
a
court
undertakes
to
provide
benefits,
it
assumes
minimal
obligations
of
rationality
in
distributing
them.
mr.
william
h.
simon
no,
but
it
is
important
to
focus
on
why.
the
reason
why
is
that
congress
and
the
states
have
a
right
to
determine
eligibility
on
the
basis
of
general
criteria.
they
do
not
have
to
consider
every
factor
bearing
on
need.
when
the
state
chooses
to
determine
eligibility
on
the
basis
of
gross
income
alone,
there
is
a
state
interest
in
simplicity
and
convenience;
there
is
also
at
least
a
formal
equality
in
the
way
people
are
measured.
in
this
instance,
however,
congress
has
given
massachusetts
its
option
and
massachusetts
has
accepted
it,
to
consider
an
additional
factor
to
make
it
a
more
precise
determination.
and
when
massachusetts
does
that,
we
submit,
it
cannot
apply
a
different
standard
of
non-medical
need
to
an
identically-situated
group
of
aged
and
disabled
people.
now,
the
relevance
of
the
legislative
history
to
both
the
statutory
and
the
equal
protection
arguments
is
that
the
entire
purpose
of
congress
in
creating
the
medically
needy
option
was
precisely
to
enable
the
states
to
avoid
the
unfairness
which
results
when
aged
and
disabled
people
who
cannot
receive
welfare
are
left
with
less
income
for
their
non-medical
needs
than
they
would
receive
if
they
could
qualify
for
welfare.
virtually
identical
language
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
on
the
original
1965
legislation
indicates
that
congress'
entire
purpose
in
doing
this
was
precisely
to
avoid
the
unfairness
that
is
involved
in
this
situation.
congress
proposed
to
do
this
through
the
two
distinctive
features
of
medically
needy
coverage.
the
first
is
the
net
income
principle;
the
second
is
the
comparability
principle,
which
now
appears
in
the
statute
in
section
1902(a)(17),
and
which
was
enacted
in
1965
for
the
precise
purpose
of
prohibiting
a
state
from
setting
its
medically
needy
standards
below
its
categorically
needy
standards.
mr.
william
h.
simon
in
1967,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
because
1902(a)(17)
is
still
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
1967
amendment
amended
that
requirement.
mr.
william
h.
simon
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
just
draw
the
court's
attention
to
two
sentences
from
the
much
longer
statement
in
the
1965
legislative
gloss
on
the
comparability
provision.
they
are
quoted
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
the
last
two
sentence
are:
"in
no
event,
however,
may
a
state
require
the
use
of
income
or
resources
which
would
bring
the
individual's
income
below
the
test
of
eligibility
under
the
state
plan.
"
"such
action
would
reduce
the
individual
below
the
level
determined
by
the
state
as
necessary
for
his
maintenance.
"
i
do
not
believe
there
can
be
any
reasonable
dispute
that
the
1965
legislation
was
intended
to
prohibit
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
the
question
then
arises
whether
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
4/3
cap
in
1967
to
alter
that
commitment
to
comparability.
mr.
william
h.
simon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
no,
we
did
not.
the
district
judge
at
the
outset
of
the
case
indicated
that
he
was
inclined
to
rule
on
the
constitutional
issue,
and
the
parties
focused
on
that
issue.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
not
at
all,
your
honor,
it
is
the
identical
relief.
congress,
in
fact,
mandated
precisely
what
the
district
court
ordered
in
1965.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
there
was
really
no
reason,
your
honor,
beside
the
fact
that
the
district
court
indicated
at
the
outset
that
it
was
going
to
focus
on
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
william
h.
simon
no,
i
do
not
think
the
court
is
obligated
to.
i
think
the
court
clearly
has
discretion
to.
i
think
rule
10(5)
specifically
gives
it
discretion,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
do
so
in
deference
to
the
principle
that
plausible
statutory
construction
should
be
adopted,
which
obviate
reaching
constitutional
issues.
mr.
william
h.
simon
indeed,
i
am,
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1967
amendment...
that
is,
the
4/3
cap...
which
the
secretary
asserts
to
require
the
discrimination
alleged
here,
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
4/3
cap
required
the
medically
need
standards
to
be
lowered
below
the
categorically
needy
standards.
congress
did
intend
to
lower
the
medically
needy
standards;
it
did
not
contemplate
that
they
would
be
lowered
below
the
categorically
needy
standards,
and
thus
abrogate
the
specific
commitment
to
equity
between
public
assistance
recipients
and
the
retired
working
corps
which
congress
made
in
the
comparability
provision.
the
legislative
history
of
the
4/3
rule
in
1967
shows
that
congress
was
reacting
to
the
new
york
program.
that
program
had
set
its
medically
standard
so
high
that
nearly
40
to
45
percent
of
the
entire
state
had
been
made
eligible,
even
before
consideration
of
medical
expenses.
congress
thought
that
new
york
had
abused
the
program
to
make
its
benefits
available
to
people
whom
congress
had
never
thought
would
benefit
from
the
program,
and
imposed
the
4/3
rule
as
a
cap.
the
sponsors
of
the
4/3
rule
repeatedly
characterized
its
purpose
as
simply
to
bring
the
new
york
program
into
line
with
congress'
original
expectations.
as
one
of
the
sponsors
put
it,
none
of
the
basic
purposes
of
title
19
have
been
harmed
or
injured
in
any
way.
the
1967
legislation
made
no
amendment
to
the
comparability
requirement
which
was
specifically
enacted
to
prevent
medically
needy
income
standards
from
being
set
below
the
corresponding
categorical
standards.
and
the
legislation
shows
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
alter
that
comparability
standard,
it
would
have
done
so.
in
fact,
in
1967,
congress
did
enact
a
provision
which
was
intended
to
make
a
minor
codification
in
the
related
comparability
provision,
also
known
as
a
comparability
provision.
and
in
that
instance,
congress
made
a
separate
and
specific
amendment
to
that
comparability
provision
which
appeared
in
the
1967
legislation
under
the
heading
"modification
of
comparability
provisions".
not
a
word
was
said
under
that
heading
about
any
modification
intended
in
the
comparability
provision
requiring
medically
needy
standards
at
least
as
high
as
categorically
needy
standards.
nor
was
anything
said
in
the
debates
or
hearings
that
suggested
any
understanding
that
this
result
would
occur.
and
again,
had
there
been
any
such
understanding,
the
record
indicates
that
there
would
have
been
such
discussion.
the
one
statutory
amendment
congress
did
consider
in
1967
which
was
identified
as
discriminating
against
the
medically
needy
was
severely
criticized
for
doing
so
and
was
eliminated
from
the
legislation
as
enacted.
the
statement
from
senator
long,
which
mr.
jones
quoted
does
not
refer
at
all
to
the
4/3
rule,
but
refers
to
a
separate
provision
that
was
considered
in
the
senate
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
income
eligibility
limitations
and
did
discriminate
against
the
medically
needy
and
was
eliminated
from
the
statute.
now,
mr.
jones
emphasizes
there
were
states
in
1967
in
which
the
4/3
maximum
was
below
the
old
age
standards.
to
be
specific,
there
were
six
states
with
medically
needy
programs,
six
out
of
22,
although
in
only
three
of
them
was
the
difference
at
all
substantial.
the
important
fact
is
that
this
conclusion
is
derived
from
a
very
elaborate
and,
we
concede,
ingenious
analysis
mr.
jones
has
performed.
it
was
not
an
analysis
that
was
performed
by
an
legislator
in
1967.
the
only
medically
needy
program
congress
discussed
in
anymore
than
a
passing
fashion
in
1967
was
the
new
york
program,
and
in
new
york,
the
4/3
maximum
was
well
above
the
old
age
assistance
levels,
there
was
no
danger
that
the
result
in
this
case
would
occur
in
new
york.
mr.
william
h.
simon
it
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
unless
the
comparability
rule
is
still
in
place,
it
is
possible
that
congress
assumed
the
comparability
rule
would
control
in
this
case,
it
is
possible
that
the
legislature
simply
never
contemplated
that
there
would
be
as
large
a
gap
between
the
afdc
and
old
age
standards
as
to
permit
this
to
be
possible.
it
is
worth
recalling
that
the
4/3
rule
was
part
of
an
omnibus
social
security
act
with
massive
changes
in
all
the
social
security
programs.
the
legislative
record
is
replete
with
complaints
by
legislators
that
there
had
not
been
time
enough
to
analyze
the
bill.
mr.
william
h.
simon
it
did
pass,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand...
and
it
is
the
law.
on
the
other
hand,
the
comparability
rule
is
also
the
law,
so
the
question
is
which
of
the
two
inconsistent
provisions
will
govern
here.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
i
would
dispute,
your
honor,
that
the
court
has
followed
that
rule
in
cases
that
involve
very
similar
situations.
in
cases
such
as
cass
versus
united
states,
for
instance,
and
the
cases
that
we
cite
on
page
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
the
court,
as
here,
has
been
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
the
literal
application
of
a
later
statute
would
require
the
abrogation
of
a
basic
policy
commitment
reflected
in
that
earlier
statute
or
earlier
legislative
history.
in
those
situations,
the
court
has
looked
to
the
legislative
history
of
both
statutes,
and
where
it
has
found
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
later
statute
no
intention
to
alter
the
prior
policy,
it
has
held
the
earlier
statute
governing.
that
analysis
applies
here.
comparability
was
a
fundamental
commitment
of
the
1965
legislation.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
the
only
program
that
we
are
seeking
to
have
the
court
cure,
your
honor.
we
do
not
dispute
at
all
that
congress
has
a
right
to
set
a
cap
on
medically
needy
income
levels,
and
in
the
majority
of
states
in
which
the
cap
would
set
the
levels
above
the
old
age
assistance
standards
or
the
ssi
standards,
we
don't
see
any
objection--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
simon
the
impact
of
the
district
court's
decision
will
be,
all
parties
agree,
to
require
that
the
medically
needy
standards
be
set
at
no
lower
than
the
ssi
standards;
it
would
be
exactly
identical
to
what
the
comparability
rule
requires.
the
effect
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
income
maximum
is,
first
of
all,
it
would
abridge
the
fundamental
commitment
congress
made
to
comparability
in
1965.
it
is
also
to
violate
the
basic
equities
that
are
expressed
throughout
the
statute,
particularly
in
title
ii,
by
penalizing
work
and
social
security
contributions
in
savings,
for
that
is
the
only
difference,
the
only
significant
difference
between
the
two
classes
in
this
situation...
is
that
the
members
of
the
disfavored
class
have
worked
more,
saved
more,
or
made
more
social
security
contributions
and
now
find
themselves
in
a
situation
where
the
income
they
have
worked
for
is
turning
into
a
liability
that
forces
them
to
live
nearly
$200
below
the
subsistence
income
that
massachusetts
provides
ssi
recipients.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
not
impute
an
intention
to
accomplish
this
result
to
congress
without
more
evidence
that
congress
intended
it
than
can
be
found
in
this
record.
now,
mr.
jones,...
let
me
turn
now
to
the
constitutional
argument.
we
submit
that
if
the
court
does
decide
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
right,
then
the
district
court's
analysis
is
entirely
sound.
that
analysis...
that
issue
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
distinction
in
the
situation
of
the
two
classes
which
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
distinction.
now,
mr.
jones
refers...
mr.
jones
mentions
the
purpose
of
saving
money.
that,
of
course,
as
this
court
has
held,
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
distinction
which
irrationally
burdens...
puts
the
burden
of
public
savings
disproportionately
on
one
class
and
not
on
another
identically-situated
class.
the
issue
was
specifically
held
in
rinaldi
vs.
yeager,
is
whether
the
specific
classifying
feature
rationally
determines
who
is
to
bear
the
burden
of
public
savings.
now,
mr.
jones
suggests
that
it
is
possible
that
the
medically
needy
have
greater
access
to
private
insurance
than
the
categorically
needy.
congress
never
made
any
such
determination.
the
references
to
private
insurance
in
the
1967
legislative
history
are
explicitly
linked
to
working
families
in
the
middle
income
range,
and
explicitly
linked
to
the
new
york
program--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
there
was
certainly
no
reason
to
conclude
that
congress
could
rationally
have
made
that
decision,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
william
h.
simon
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
and
let
me
try
to
answer
it.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
medically
needy
have
any
better
ability
to
purchase
private
insurance.
they
do
have
more
gross
income
but
whatever
advantage
gross
income
gives
them
in
getting
insurance
is
precisely
offset
by
the
fact
that
they
have
medical
expenses.
medical
expenses
are
equally
relevant
as
income
to
the
ability
to
purchase
insurance.
mr.
william
h.
simon
your
honor,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
an
awful
lot
of
the
aged
and
disabled
do
so,
and
the
thrust
of
congress'
consideration--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not
rational,
your
honor.
there
is
no
basis,
either
in
a
priori
logic
or
in
any
data.
indeed,
the
data
suggest
to
the
contrary.
in
1965,
congress
considered
data
on
the
availability
of
insurance
to
the
aged
and
disabled...
to
the
aged,
and
concluded
that
such
insurance
that
was
so
available
was
so
ineffective
that
it
displaced
the
principal
coverage
that
was
then
available
with
part
a
of
medicare.
since
that
time
there
has
been
no
federal
policy
in
favor
of...
encouraging
the
purchase
of
private
insurance
by
the
aged
and
disabled.
nor
would
that
be
rational--
mr.
william
h.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
issue
of
assuming
that
a
hypothetical
rational
basis
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
classification
of
whether
the
private
insurance
argument
is
a
sufficient
rational
basis,
of
course.
of
course,
amicus
have
argued
in
their
brief
that
a
hypothetical
rational
basis
is
not
sufficient,
at
least
under
minimum
rationality,
but
for
the
purposes
of
justice
white's
question
and
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
want
to
assume
that
it
is
sufficient.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
in
the
case
of
a
classification
which
results
from
legislative
inadvertence
that
is
not
supported
by
an
actual
legislative
judgment,
that
a
higher
standard
than
minimum
rationale
be
applied.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
four
members
of
this
court
at
least
have
subscribed--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--that
is
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--no,
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
for
that
reason
i
want
to
raise
the
question
of
whether,
in
fact,
there
is
a
sufficient
hypothetical
basis--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--well
again,
justice
rehnquist,
congress
enacted
two
laws.
they
are
in
inconsistent.
there
is
no...
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
second
statute
abridge
the
fundamental
policy.
mr.
william
h.
simon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
a
statutory
construction
argument.
on
the
other
hand,
the
legislative
history
does
have
bearing
under
the
analysis
in,
for
instance,
schweiker
versus
wilson,
because
the
first
place
one
looks
when
one
cannot
infer
a
rational
basis
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
is
to
the
legislative
history
to
see
if
congress,
in
fact,
made
an
explicit
judgment
that
some
purpose
would
be
rationally
served
by
the
classification.
we
submit
in
this
case
that
congress
made
no
such
judgment
in
this
judgment
here.
the
next
question,
of
course,
is
whether
the
government
can
hypothesize
a
rational
basis.
we
would
submit
that
a
hypothetical
rational
basis
of
the
sort
that
the
government
hypothesized
would
have
to
meet
at
least
two
conditions
to
be
sufficient.
first,
it
would
have
to
have
some
consistency
with
the
statutory
framework.
so
much
is
implied
in
the
requirement
of
rationality.
second,
it
would
have
to
be
supported
either
by
some
judicially-noticeable
data,
or
at
least
by
some
a
priori
common
sense
plausibility.
we
submit
that
on
reflection,
the
private
insurance
argument
satisfies
neither
of
these
criteria.
first,
with
respect
to
statutory
framework,
the
private
insurance
argument
is
not
only
unsupported
by
any
actual
legislative
judgment
that
the
appellees
have
better
access
to
insurance,
or
that
encouraging
to
purchase
insurance
would
reduce
medicaid
costs;
it
is,
in
fact,
contrary
to
the
premises
which
congress
acted
on
when
it
created
the
medically
needy
program,
which
are
precisely
that
people
who
have
less
income
after
medical
expenses
than
welfare
recipients
are
identically
situated
to
welfare
recipients
and
should
be
treated
as
identically
situated
to
welfare
recipients.
now,
with
respect
to
judicially
noticeable
data,
the
only
such
data
about
private
insurance
that
has
been
cited
to
the
court
is
the
data
we
cite
on
pages
44
through
46
of
our
brief.
that
data
consists
of
the
data
which
congress
considered
in
1965
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
private
insurance
to
the
aged
when
it
enacted
the
medicare
program,
and
some
more
recent
data,
published
data,
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
that
data
which
we
have
cited
to
the
court.
that
data
indicates
two
things.
first,
it
indicates
that
there
is
no
private
insurance
available
to
the
aged
which
covers
the
majority
of
services
for
which
medicaid
expenditure
are
made.
70
%
of
medicaid
expenditures
are
made
for
private
insurance...
excuse
me,
are
made
for
nursing
home
care.
virtually
no
private
insurance
covers
the
type
of
nursing
home
care
for
which
medicaid
expenditures
on
behalf
of
the
aged
are
made.
second,
the
data
indicates
that
where
private
insurance
does
cover
expenses
that
medicaid
does
cover,
it
does
so
at
greater
cost
than
medicaid
does
because
of
the
expenses
of
sales
effort,
advertising
and
profit
which
often
exceed
80
%
of
the
total
cost
of
the
insurance.
now,
i
would
submit
that
there
are
two
rational
conclusions
that
one
can
draw
from
this
data,
and
that
there
are
no
rational
conclusions
that
one
can
draw
from
it
which
sustain
the
classification.
first,
the
first
conclusion
that
the
data
suggests
is
that
the
principal
incentive
effect
of
the
discrimination
in
this
case
on
people
who
fear
ending
up
in
the
situation
of
the
appellees,
is
not
to
encourage
the
purchase
of
private
insurance
but
to
encourage
them
to
make
efforts
to
reduce
post-retirement
income
so
that
they
can
qualify
for
ssi,
by
working
less,
saving
less
or
by
investing
their
income
in
exempt
assets
such
as
their
home
or
burial
plots,
which
are
exempt
under
medicaid
and
ssi.
secondly,
i
would
submit
that
the
most
plausible
conclusion
from
this
data
is
that
even
if
the
discrimination
does
encourage
people
who
fear
ending
up
in
the
situation
of
mr.
hunter
and
mr.
hogan
to
purchase
private
insurance,
that
their
purchase
of
private
insurance
would
increase,
rather
than
reduce,
the
cost
of
the
medicaid
program.
that
is
true
for
this
reason:
explicitly
under
the
statute
under
section
1902(a)(17),
and
under
all
the
regulations,
the
medicaid
program
must
credit
the
cost
of
the
premiums
against
surplus
income
in
determining
eligibility
of
the
applicant.
the
effect
of
that
is
that
the
medicaid
program,
in
effect,
pays
for
the
insurance
because
by
crediting
the
premiums,
it
in
effect
reduces
the
amount
of
expenses
which
the
applicant
would
otherwise
have
to
make
for
his
own
medical
expenses
and
increases
the
amount
that
the
state
must
pay.
if
the
insurance
is
a
bad
buy
for
the
applicant,
it
is
a
bad
buy
for
the
medicaid
program
and
it
will
increase
medicaid
costs.
now,
of
course,
if
congress
had
made
a
contrary
determination,
we
would
expect
this
court
to
defer
to
it.
but
congress
has
not
considered
the
issue.
we
submit
that
the
only
rational
course
when
all
of
the
data
before
the
court
completely
contradicts
the
hypothetical
premise
of
the
government,
is
that
this
is
not
a
rational
basis.
now,
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
return
to
the
issue
that
i
think
justice
stevens
originally
raised,
which
is
the
question
of
is
there
a
difference
in
the
extent
to
which
the
income
of
the
two
classes
fluctuates.
when
i
answered
that
question
i
should
have
pointed
out
that
the
accounting
period
for
medicaid
eligibility
is
six
months.
that
is,
in
order
to
qualify
for
medically
needy
coverage,
an
applicant
must
demonstrate
that
his
or
her
medical
expenses
will
exceed
the
amount
of
his
or
her
surplus
income
for
at
least
six
successive
months.
now,
both
of
the
named
appellees
have,
in
fact,
permanent
conditions
and
indeed,
it
is
probable
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
class
have
conditions
that
go
on
for
much
longer
than
six
months,
and
of
course,
they
must
re-establish
eligibility
every
six
months.
by
contrast,
the
accounting
period
for
ssi
is
from
one
to
three
months,
so
that
one
can
establish
eligibility
for
ssi
if
one
has
income,
under
those
standards,
for
a
single
month;
at
most
three
months,
depending
on
when
in
the
quarter
one
applies.
so
that
insofar
as
one
can
determine
from
the
statute,
the
income
of
ssi
recipients
is
more
likely
to
fluctuate
than
the
income
of
the
medically
needy.
now
i
must
say
something
to
respond
to
an
argument
which
mr.
jones
makes
in
the
reply
brief
which
he
has
not
yet
made
here
today,
but
since
he
may
yet
make
it,
i
want
to
anticipate
it.
if
i
understand
mr.
jones'
reply
brief
correctly,
he
denies
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
an
income
comparability
requirement
in
the
statute
which
requires
comparability
between
medically
needy
and
categorically
needy
classes.
if
that
is
his
position...
and
i
may
misunderstand
him...
it
is
an
astonishing
position,
and
it
is
contrary
to
congress'
clear
understanding
and
the
clear
understanding
of
the
federal
courts.
i
just
wanted
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
a
sentence
from
the
conferees'
report
on
the
1981
medicaid
amendments
which
appears
at
three
places
in
the
congressional
record
and
cited
on
page
14
of
our
brief.
"moreover,
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
conferees
to
alter
the
requirements
under
section
1902(a)(17)
of
the
social
security
act
relating
to
comparable
treatment
of
income
and
resources
between
categorically
needy
and
medically
needy
programs.
"
mr.
william
h.
simon
this
was
made--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--this
is
1981,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
courts
in
the
numerous
cases
we
cite
on
page
13
of
our
brief,...
and
before
today
i
would
have
said
the
secretary
himself...
have
always
interpreted
the
comparability...
well,
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
simon
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
evidence
that
the
comparability
requirement
requires
comparability
of
income
standards--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
there
was...
and
the
legislation
is
somewhat
confusing
because
there
were
numerous
requirements
known
as
comparability
requirements.
there
was
a
set
of
requirements
which
required
that
the
aged
and
disabled
be
treated
the
same
as
families.
that
is
the
so-called
horizontal
comparability
requirement
which
was
eliminated
in
1981.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
purport
of
the
sentence
i
read--
mr.
william
h.
simon
--no,
your
honor,
it
appears,
at
least
the
most
recent
evidence
that
bears
directly
on
that
indicates
the
contrary.
in
1980,
congress
did
address
an
importantly
related
problem
and
left
the
record
indicating
that
either
it
is
not
aware
of
the
problem
or
it
understands
comparability
to
preclude
medically
needy
levels
below
the
4/3
rule.
mr.
william
h.
simon
the
legis...
we
acknowledge
the
subsequent
legislative
history
is
contradictory
and
inconclusive.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
clear
that
since
1965
not
a
single
legislator
has
expressed
any
intention
to
abrogate
the
comparability
requirement.
mr.
william
h.
simon
well,
the
only
legislative
history
that
remotely...
first
of
all,
i
should
say
that
the
1980
legislation
clearly
indicates
congress
is
not
aware
of
it,
or
that
it
understands
that
comparability
controls
here.
that
was
the
1980
amendment
to
the
veterans
benefit
act,
which
explicitly
was
made
not
applicable
in
medically
needy
states
on
the
explicitly
premise
that
in
medically
needy
states
a
person,
after
losing
categorically
needy
eligibility,
could
be
treated
no
worse
as
a
medically
needy
person.
