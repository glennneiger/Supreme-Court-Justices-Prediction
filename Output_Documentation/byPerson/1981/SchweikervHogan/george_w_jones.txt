mr.
george
w.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
differences
in
the
financial
eligibility
requirements
prescribed
in
section
1903(f)
of
the
social
security
act
for
the
two
major
groups
of
potential
medicaid
beneficiaries
violate
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
first
group
is
the
categorically
needy.
aged,
blind
and
disabled
individuals
whose
income
is
less
than
the
income
limits
established
in
the
cash
assistance
programs.
the
second
group
is
referred
to
as
the
medically
needy,
and
includes
aged,
blind
and
disabled
individuals
whose
income
is
greater
than
the
cash
assistance
limits.
all
of
the
appellees
are
in
the
second
group.
the
decision
in
this
case,
however,
will
not
only
determine
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
differences
in
the
income
requirements,
but
also,
the
validity
of
congress's
decision
to
require
participating
states
to
provide
medicaid
coverage
to
the
categorically
needy
but
not
to
the
medically
needy.
the
medicaid
program
was
established
in
title
19
of
the
social
security
act
and
provides
federal
financial
assistance
to
states
that
choose
to
pay
for
medical
treatment
for
certain
groups
of
poor
people.
states
that
choose
to
participate
in
the
program
must
provide
medicaid
coverage
to
all
individuals
who
are
receiving
benefits
under
one
of
two
cash
assistance
programs.
either
the
federally-financed
supplement
security
income
for
the
aged,
blind
and
disabled
program,
or
the
jointly-financed
program
for
providing
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
the
afdc
program.
participating
states
are
not
required
as
a
general
matter
to
provide
medicaid
benefits
to
any
other
group
of
individuals.
therefore,
a
person
who
is
not
eligible
for
benefits
under
one
of
the
cash
assistance
programs
is
also
ineligible
for
benefits
under
the
medicaid
program
unless
his
state
chooses
to
provide
benefits
to
one
of
the
optional
categories.
the
major
optional
coverage
group
is
the
medically
needy;
people
who
are
ineligible
for
cash
assistance
only
because
of
the
amount
of
their
income.
section
1903,
however,
provides
that
states
are
only
entitled
to
federal
financial
assistance
for
providing
medicaid
benefits
to
a
medically
needy
individual
if
he
incurs
medical
expenses
in
excess
of
the
difference
between
his
income
and
the
state's
spend
down
level.
the
spend
down
level
for
a
person
with
a
family
of
a
given
size
must
not
exceed
133
1/3
percent
of
the
state
afdc
payment
amount
for
a
family
of
the
same
size.
the
ssi
program
guarantees
a
federal
minimum
benefit,
but
the
states
may
supplement
that
amount.
if
the
state
chooses
to
make
supplemental
payments
to
individuals
who
are
receiving
ssi
benefits
or
who
would
be
eligible
for
ssi
benefits
except
for
the
amount
of
their
income,
the
state
may
also
provide
medicaid
benefits
to
those
individuals
without
regard
to
the
133
1/2
percent
limitation
prescribed
in
section
1903.
massachusetts
participates
in
the
medicaid
program,
provides
medicaid
benefits
to
the
medically
needy,
makes
supplemental
benefits
to
ssi
benefit
recipients
or
people
who
would
be
eligible
for
ssi
except
for
the
amount
of
their
income,
and
provides
medicaid
benefits
to
people
who
are
eligible
for
supplemental
payments.
all
of
those
choices
are
voluntary
choices
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
massachusetts.
appellees
filed
this
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
challenging
the
maximum
medically
needy
spend
down
level
prescribed
in
section
1903(f)
as
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
appellees
also
challenge
the
corresponding
provisions
of
the
massachusetts
medicaid
plan
as
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no.
appellees
represent
a
class
of
all
present
and
future
social
security
benefit
recipients
who
live
in
massachusetts,
are
disabled
or
older
than
65
years
old,
are
ineligible
for
cash
assistance
because
of
the
amount
of
their
income,
and
have
medical
expenses
not
subject
to
payment
by
third
parties
that
are
greater
than
the
difference
between
their
countable
income
and
the
cash
assistance
income
limits.
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
that
to
the
extent
that
section
1903(f)
requires
the
state
of
massachusetts
to
establish
a
spend
down
level
that
is
less
than
the
state
supplemental
payment
income
limits,
the
statute
discriminated
against
appellees,
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
time
for
comparing
the
circumstances
of
the
medically
needy
including
the
appellees,
the
group
to
whom
section
1903(f)
applies,
and
the
circumstances
of
the
categorically
needy,
to
whom
section
1903(f)
is
not
applicable,
was
after
the
medically
needy
had
incurred
medical
expenses.
according
to
the
district
court,
at
that
point
there
is
no
difference
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy,
and
consequently,
no
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
groups,
as
section
1903(f)
does.
mr.
george
w.
jones
this
is
an
example
of--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
the
difference
in
the
spend
down
level
and
the
income
limits
is
about
$100.
it
depends
on
the
particular
category
the
applicants
fall
in.
massachusetts
has
different
income
limits
for
an
aged
couple
where
both
individuals
are
over--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--right,
it
is
that
kind--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that
is
right.
and
the
district
court...
and
the
argument
of
the
appellees
assumes
that
the
medically
needy
will
pay
the
medical
expenses
as
soon
as
they
are
incurred,
or
at
least--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that
is
right.
but
they
ignore
the
fact
that
the
medically
needy
might
very
well
pay
the
expenses
over
a
ten-month
period
rather
than
a
one-month
period,
so
that
they
would
never
end
up
with
less
money
for
non-medical
expenses
than
the
categorically
needy.
as
i
mentioned,
the
appellees
failed
to
raise
their
statutory
argument
in
the
district
court.
we
have
set
out
at
some
length
the
reasons
we
think
that
argument
is
insubstantial
in
our
reply
brief,
and
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
will
turn
to
the
constitutional
argument.
mr.
george
w.
jones
we
don't
make
that
argument,
although--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that
is
right.
in
fact,
the
appellees
argue
that
it
was
required
by
the
statute,
and
the
district
court
proceed
on
that
assumption,
that
section
1903(f)
required
the
spend
down
level
in
massachusetts
to
be
equal
to
133
1/3
percent
of
the
afdc
payment
amount,
whether
or
not--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
i
am
suggesting
that
you
should
reject
it.
mr.
george
w.
jones
sure.
mr.
george
w.
jones
and
reject
that
as
well.
mr.
george
w.
jones
which
comparability
requirement?
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
problem
is
that
section
1903(f)
was
the...
was
enacted
in
1967.
to
the
extent
that
the
65
legislation
imposed
any
limits
on
the
extent
to
which
the
state
could
set
a
medically
needy
spend
down
level,
section
1903(f)
clearly
modified
that
requirement,
because
it
states
without
exception...
except
for
the
categorically
needy...
that
the
state
spend
down
level
shall
not
exceed
133
1/3
percent
of
the
amount
that
would
be
paid
under
the
state
afdc
program
to
a
family
of
the
same
size.
congress
clearly
did
not
believe
that
there
was
any
necessary
relationship
between
the
spend
down
level
and
the
cash
assistance
levels.
section
1903(f)
is
clear
on
its
face
and
it
makes
an
exception,
an
express
exception,
for
the
categorically
needy.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
last
year,
representative
frank
of
massachusetts...
and
according
to
appellees,
in
response
to
this
litigation...
introduced
a
bill
that
would
adopt
exactly
the
statutory
argument
that
appellees
press
on
this
court.
congress
did
not
act
on
it
last
term
and
i
am
not
even
sure
that
it
has
been
referred
to
a
committee.
there
has
been
no
action
on
it,
a
far
as
we
know.
contrary
to
appellees'
submission
and
contrary
to
the
premise
of
the
submission
of
amicus
massachusetts
association
of
older
americans,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
post
hoc
rationalization
of
congress's
action.
when
congress
enacted
section
1903(f)
in
1967,
its
stated
purpose
was
to
reduce
federal
expenditures.
in
its
view,
in
congress's
view,
the
states
had
been
much
too
generous
in
defining
who
constitute
the
medically
needy.
as
the
house
committee
clearly
indicated
its
concern
that
some
of
the
plans
operated
to
greatly
reduce
the
incentives
for
participating
in
the
optional
medicare
program,
and
the
committee
further
emphasized
its
view
that
medicaid
was
never
intended
to
supplant
private
health
insurance.
as
the
senate
committee
observed,
a
tendency
of
some
states
to
identify
as
eligibles
for
medical
assistance
under
title
19
large
numbers
of
persons
who
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
pay
some
or
all
of
their
own
medical
expenses,
has
not
only
significantly
increased
the
amount
of
federal
funds
flowing
into
this
program,
but
has
developed
future
cost
projections
at
a
level
totally
inconsistent
with
the
expectations
of
congress
when
it
enacted
this
program
in
1965.
congress's
explicit
purpose
was
to
limit
federal
expenditures,
and
to
do
so
by
limiting
the
state's
coverage
of
the
medically
needy.
by
definition,
the
medically
needy
have
more
income
than
the
categorically
needy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
the
only
difference
between
the
two
groups.
furthermore,
since
the
medically
needy
group
includes
anyone
who
would
be
eligible
for
ssi
except
for
the
amount
of
his
income,
an
individual
can
qualify
for
medicaid
benefits
as
medically
needy,
no
matter
how
much
greater
than
the
cash
assistance
limits
his
income
might
be.
as
a
class,
therefore,
the
medically
needy
are
plainly
better
able
than
the
categorically
needy
to
pay
their
own
medical
expenses
or
to
take
steps
to
assure
that
future
medical
expenses
can
be
paid
by,
for
example,
purchasing
private
insurance.
with
few
exceptions,
it
was
plain
to
the
members
of
the
90th
congress
that
the
medically
needy
were
less
needy
that
the
categorically
needy.
all
the
proposals
introduced
in
1967
to
limit
federal
expenditures
were
directed
at
limiting
expenditures
on
behalf
of
the
medically
needy.
as
senator
long
put
it,
we
are
talking
here
about,
the
people
who
are
not
on
the
cash
public
assistance
rolls.
that
is
the
area
in
which
we
think
savings
should
be
made.
on
this
point,
senator
long
spoke
for
an
overwhelming
majority
of
congress.
section
1903(f)
distinguishes
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
need
because
the
medically
needy
are
financially
better
able
to
provide
for
their
own
medical
expenses.
precisely
the
same
reasoning
underlies
congress's
decision
to
require
the
states
or
participating
states
to
cover
the
categorically
needy
but
not
the
medically
needy.
therefore,
the
reason
for
the
distinction
in
section
1903(f)
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy
is
implicit
in
the
structure
of
the
medicaid
program
itself.
now,
to
the
extent
that...
to
the
extent
relevant
in
this
case,
section
1903(f)
distinguishes
between
two
groups:
aged,
blind
and
disabled
individuals
whose
income
is
less
than
the
cash
assistance
levels,
and
aged,
blind
and
disabled
individuals
whose
income
is
greater
than
the
cash
assistance
levels.
accordingly,
the
appropriate
groups,
or
the
appropriate
classifications
for
equal
protection
analysis
are
those
two.
appellees'
status
as
social
security
benefit
recipients
is
completely
immaterial.
there
are
social
security
benefit
recipients
on
both
sides
and
appellees
don't
even
suggest
that
there
are
any
disproportionate
number
of
social
security
benefit
recipients
in
the
medically
needy
category.
in
addition,
it
is
inappropriate
for
equal
protection
analysis
to
compare
aged,
blind
and
disabled
individuals
whose
income
is
greater
than
the
cash
assistance
levels,
but
whose
income
net
of
medical
expenses
is
less
than
the
cash
assistance
levels,
with
the
group
of
aged,
blind
and
disabled
individuals
whose
gross
income
is
less
than
the
cash
assistance
levels
because
congress
simply
did
not
create
that
classification.
the
consequences
of
adopting
the
district
court's
analysis
and
appellees'
contentions
in
this
case
are
quite
far
reaching.
if,
as
the
district
court
held,
for
purposes
of
equal
protection
analysis
the
income
of
the
medically
need
net
of
medical
expenses
must
be
compared
with
the
gross
income
of
the
categorically
needy,
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction
between
the
two
groups.
in
fact,
there
is
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no.
as
far
as
i
know,
he
did
not
have
such
data.
he
had
the
named
plaintiffs--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
would
have
thought
so,
but
apparently
not
because
the
district
court
explicitly
rejected
our
contention
that
the
time
for
comparing
the
two
groups
is
before
medical
expenses
are
incurred.
and
if
that
is
true,
fullington
v.
shea
was
wrongly
decided
and
must
be
overruled;
two,
section
1902(a)(10)
of
the
act,
which
distinguishes
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy
by
requiring
the
states
to
cover
one
but
not
the
other...
or,
requiring
the
states
to
cover
the
categorically
needy
but
not
the
medically
needy,
is
unconstitutional.
and
finally
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
20
jurisdictions
that
now
provide
medicaid
benefits
for
the
categorically
needy
but
do
not
provide
any
benefits
at
all
for
the
medically
needy
must
either
extend
coverage
to
the
medically
needy
or
simply
drop
out
of
the
program
altogether.
the
district
court
seemed
to
be
completely
oblivious
to
those
consequences,
and
we
think
they
are...
they
simply
underscore
the
error
in
his
decision
and
the
error
in
his
analysis.
contrary
to
the
premise
of
the
district
court's
opinion
also,
there
is
no
basis
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
for
concluding
that
the
difference
in
treatment
of
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy
was
the
result
of
some
sort
of
legislative
accident.
on
its
face,
the
statute
distinguishes
between
those
people
who
are
eligible
for
cash
assistance
and
those
people
who
are
not.
the
statute
only
applies
to
the
medically
needy.
the
distinction
drawn
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy
was
described
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
described
in
the
conference
report,
it
is
the
67
amendments.
the
information
before
congress
plainly
indicated
that
in
many
states,
the
133
1/3
percent
of
the
afdc
amount
was
going
to
be
less
than
the
old
age
assistance
income
limits.
indeed,
the
under
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
now
health
and
human
services,
specifically
pointed
out
that
133
1/3
percent
of
the
afdc
payment
amount,
in
some
states,
was
even
lower
than
the
afdc
standard
of
need.
although
no
one
disputed
the
goal
of
saving
money,
the
provision
that
was
ultimately
adopted
as
section
1903(f)
of
the
act
was
repeatedly
criticized
on
the
basis
that
it
was
too
low.
congressmen
claimed
that
the
provision
would
destroy
the
concept
of
medical
indigence
in
the
medicaid
statute.
it
is
unlikely
in
these
circumstances
that
the
congressmen...
that
the
entire
congress,
as
appellees
contend,
ignored
or
overlooked
the
significance
of
the
data
indicating
the
effect
of
adopting
this
133
1/3
percent
limitation.
in
our
view,
it
is
far
more
likely
that
the
few
people
in
congress
regarded
the
difference
in
treatment
as...
difference
in
treatment
of
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy...
to
be
as
offensive
as
appellees
seem
to
think
they
should
have.
indeed,
senator
javits
expressly
argued
or
made
several
policy
arguments
against
discriminating
against
the
medically
needy.
the
senate...
senator
javits's
arguments
were
made
in
support
of
the
kuchel
amendment.
the
senate,
by
a
vote
of
more
than...
by
a
margin
of
more
than
two
to
one,
rejected
those
policy
arguments
and
enacted
the
senate
bill
as
the
committee
had
proposed,
with
the
expression
provision
that
discriminated
against
the
medically
needy.
that
is
a
different
provision
than
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here,
but
it
was
replaced
by
the
provision
here,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
vote
in
the
senate
on
the
kuchel
amendment
plainly
indicates
that
at
least
those
members
of
the
senate
who
voted
on
that
bill
did
not
regard
discrimination
against
the
medically
needy,
or
a
difference
in
treatment
of
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy
as
something
so
offensive
that
it
could
never
be
tolerated.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
george
w.
jones
appellees
state
that
the
district
court
indicated
that
it
was
inclined
to
rule
on
the
constitutional
argument
as
an
explanation
for
their
failure
to
raise
the
statutory
argument
in
the
district
court.
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case
does
not
raise
the
statutory
argument,
and
focuses
solely
on
the
constitutional
argument.
in
fact,
count
one
of
the
complaint
states,
the
statutory
4/3
limit
on
reimbursement
requires
this.
the
statutory
4/3
limit
on
reimbursement
and
the
regulations
of
the
secretary--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--if
the
judge
had
done
that,
i
would
probably
agree.
mr.
george
w.
jones
but
this
is
an
appellate
court
and
not
a
trial
court,
and--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
i
don't
think
you
can
decide
it
without
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
it.
our
only
opportunity
to--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--a
whole
reply
brief...
but
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
this
issue
in
the
lower
courts,
and
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
expand
on
the
argument.
we
think
our
reply
brief
is
perfectly
adequate
to
demonstrate
the
insubstantiality
of
the
statutory
argument.
but
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
not
reach
that
issue,
or
should
ignore
that
issue,
and
if
it
does
it
should
reject
it.
mr.
george
w.
jones
or
remand
it
and
give
the
appellees
an
opportunity
to
amend
their
complaint
to
raise
it.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
the
complaint
frames
the
issues
in
litigation
as
a
general
matter,
and
the
complaint
in
this
case
excludes
the
statutory
issue.
and
furthermore,
the
arguments
in
the
district
court
presumed
or
assumed
that
a
statutory
issue
was
a
non-issue.
the
statutory
argument
that
appellees
raise
now
is
simply
an
attempt
to
win
in
this
court
a
battle
that
they
have
already
lost
in
congress.
appellees
now
rely
on
a
statement
in
the
1981
legislative
history,
but
in
our
brief
we
quote
from
the
1972
provision
that
the
senate
adopted,
that
would
have
dealt
exactly
with
this
problem
and
it
was
eliminated
in
conference.
there
is
no
statutory...
cannon
of
statutory
construction
that
requires
congress
to
state
the
obvious.
so
we
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
at
all
for
the
statutory
argument.
now,
the
second
point,
the
difference
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
appellees
is
not,
is
not
that
the
appellees
have
worked.
there
are
people
in
the
categorically
needy
group
who
have
worked
and
whose
social
security
benefits
are
simply
less
than
the
cash
assistance
level.
the
difference
between
these
two
groups,
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy,
including
appellees,--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--no,
it
suggests
only
that
they
were--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--they
were
paid
a
little
more.
mr.
george
w.
jones
and
so
they
may
not...
they
may
very
well
not
be
anymore
hardworking
than--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--okay.
furthermore,
mr.
justice
stevens,
contrary
to
professor
simon's
answer
to
your
question,
if
the
time
for
comparing
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy
is
after
the
medically
needy
have
incurred
medical
expenses,
and
what
you
compare
is
the
income
net
of
medical
expenses
to
the
gross
income
of
the
categorically
needy,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two
groups,
and
all
states
would
be
required
to
adopt
medically
needy
programs
if
they
participate
in
the
medicaid
program.
i
mean,
there
is
simply
no
difference
between
the
two
groups
other
than
that.
moreover,
in
response
to
another
of
your
questions,
professor
simon
indicated
that
somehow
the
individuals
in
this
class
do
not
include
people
with
average
income,
but
it
clearly
does.
the
medically
needy
group
includes
anybody
whose
income...
or
any
aged,
blind
or
disabled
individual
whose
income
is
greater
than
the
gross...
the
cash
assistance
income
limits.
so
if
an
individual's
income--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
his
income
is
the
same.
if
you
deduct
the
medical
expenses--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
george
w.
jones
no.
and
that
is
exactly
the
point.
if
a
state
adopts
a
medicaid
program
for
the
categorically
needy,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
there
is
any
legitimate
reason
for
them
not
to
cover
people
whose
income,
net
of
medical
expenses,
is
less
than
the
income
of
the
categorically
needy.
the
appellees
make
an
argument
about
private
insurance.
they
say
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
this.
congress
clearly
said
the
reason
it
was
distinguishing
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy
is
because
the
operation
of
some
state
plans
operated
to
discourage
both
the
participation
in
the
optional
medicare
program,
as
well
as
to
supplant
private
insurance.
the
house
committee
indicated
that
it
clearly
did
not
intend
that.
and
the
senate
committee
agreed.
now,
appellees
argue
that
the
benefits
provided
by
private
insurance
just
would
not
be
sufficient,
or
would
be
worth
less
than
the
premiums
that
the
medically
needy
would
have
to
pay.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
something
that
should
be
submitted
to
congress,
but
congress
clearly
believed
that
people
with
gross
income
in
excess
of
the
cash
assistance
level
were
better
able
than
the
categorically
needy
to
take
care
of
their
own
medical
expenses,
either
by
buying
private
insurance
or
some
other
means.
throughout
this
case
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
spend
down
level
somehow
indicates
the
amount
of
income
that
will,
in
fact,
be
left
for
non-medical
expenses.
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
statute
simply
requires
that
an
individual
incur
medical
expenses
of
a
particular
amount.
it
does
not
require
that
he
pay
medical
expenses
in
the
particular
period
that
the
state
uses.
massachusetts
uses
a
six-month
period.
but
if
the
individual
pays
the
expenses
over
a
ten-month
period,
for
example,
he
may
never
end
up
with
less
money
for
non-medical
expenses
than
any
categorically
needy
person.
appellees'
entire
argument
depends
on
the
proposition
that
incurring
medical
expenses
somehow
makes
them
the
same
as
the
categorically
needy
whose
gross
income
is
less
than
the
cash
assistance
income
limitations.
our
submission,
however,
is
that
gross
income
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
basis
for
distinguishing
between
groups
of
individuals
in
a
program
intended
to
provide
medical
assistance
for
the
poor.
