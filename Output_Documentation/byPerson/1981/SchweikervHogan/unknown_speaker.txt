unknown
speaker
was
there
a
statutory
argument
eventually
presented?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
is
this...
your
footnote
9,
is
that
an
example
of
the
difference?
is
that
in
your
brief,
page
6,
footnote
9.
unknown
speaker
how
this
thing
works?
unknown
speaker
and
the
disadvantage
in
dollars
between
the
two
classes
runs
out
to
what?
about
$200
a
month?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
is
this
difference.
unknown
speaker
between
the
two
classes
that
is
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
argument
that
that
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
i
am
getting
$600
a
month
and
they
pay
medical
expenses
of
$250,
then
they
are
down
below
the
level,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest
that
the
appellees
are
not
entitled
to
be
present
it
here
as
a
ground
for
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
it
never
was
raised
below.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
we
should
ignore
the
statutory
argument
or
meet
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
we
should
decide
it
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
and
reject
it
and
then
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes.
if
we
were
to
find,
for
some
reason,
that
the
comparability
requirement
applied
to
the
case,
how
could
we
reconcile
it
with
the
spend
down
provision?
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
argument
made
by
the
appellees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
do
you
know
whether
there
is
any
legislation
pending
in
congress
to
overcome
these
fiscal
anomalies
that
the
appellees
complain
of?
unknown
speaker
how
was
the
district
court
able
to
compare
the
two
incomes?
did
he
have
statistics
before
him
that
would
have
related
to
all
of
the...
the
income
of
all
of
the
medically
needy?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
he
recognize
the
fact
that
congress
is
entitled
to
make
general
classifications
in
this
field,
and
that
you
don't
just
single
out
a
few
basket
cases,
so
to
speak,
to
prove
a
point?
unknown
speaker
mr.
simon,
is
it
necessary,
in
your
constitutional
argument,
as
i
took
it
to
be
from
the
district
court's
opinion,
that
the
federal
level
be
compared
with
the
massachusetts
level?
unknown
speaker
yes.
because
of
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
then
would
the
district
court's
holding
mean
that
the
federal
statute
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied
in
massachusetts,
but
that
it
could
be
in
other
states?
unknown
speaker
so
that
a
law
of
congress
is
held
unconstitutional
in
some
states
and
constitutional
in
others,
under
his
ruling.
unknown
speaker
but
i
did
not
understand
him
to
say
that
one
group
was
all
indigents.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
statutory
classification
is
much
broader
than
indigents.
unknown
speaker
those,
the
medically
needy.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
class
actually
is
one
that
fluctuates
in
membership.
at
any
given
point
in
time
a
person
may
be
rather
wealthy,
but
if
he
suddenly
has
a
lot
of
medical
expenses,
then
he
becomes
a
member
of
the
class.
unknown
speaker
one
other
question.
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
congress
provided
for
medicaid
just
for
the
categorically
needy
and
had
no
provision
for
the
medically
needy?
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
thing
that
always
troubled
me
about
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
once
congress
does,
or
a
legislature.
my
assumption
is
that
congress
decides
to
give
medicaid
benefits
to
the
categorically
needy,
period.
now,
does
he
have
an
obligation
to
give
medical
benefits
to
people
who,
because
of
their
medical
expenses,
are
equally
needy?
unknown
speaker
when
was
section
1903(f)
enacted?
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
focus...
isn't
that
the
one
that
the
district
court
declared
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
focusing,
then,
on
1965?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
statutory
construction
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
present
it
below?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
take
a
position
contrary
to
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
suggest
there
was
even
a
statutory
issue.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
if
you
win
on
this,
do
you
think
it
changes
the
relief
you
get?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
reason
it
was
not
raised
below
or
did
you
just
not
find
the
statute--
unknown
speaker
--well,
your...
do
you
think
we
are
obligated
to
entertain
your
statutory
issue?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
reach
the
positions
of
the
united
states
and...
in
their
answer
to
your
statutory
argument.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
congress
to
say
4/3
except
when
it
goes
below
the
categorically
needy...
it
did
not
say
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
they
would
have
voted
it
against
it,
then,
but
it
nonetheless
passed.
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
it
is
the
most
recently-enacted--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
sustain
the
statutory
argument,
it
would
only
cure
these
cases
where
the
level
falls
below?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
impact
of
the
district
court's
decision?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
impact
of
the
district
court's
decision?
the
same?
unknown
speaker
maybe
congress
did
not
make
any
express
reference
to
it,
but
is
it
a
rational
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
whether
they
could,
but
could
anybody
draw
that
inference?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know...
an
awful
lot
of
people
spend
an
awful
lot
less
for
medical
insurance
than
the
elderly
end
up
paying
for
doctors'
bills,
which
are
paid
by
their
insurance
company.
unknown
speaker
that
may
not
be
clear,
but
is
it
possible?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible?
is
it
rationale
to
think
that
a
medically
needy
person
with
a
higher
gross
income
has
greater
access
to
medical
insurance
that
might
pay
his
very
large
medical
bills?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
position
on
that?
may
we
consider
some
rational
basis
that
you
do
not
see
in
the
legislative
history,
or
anything
else?
can't
we
imagine
one?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
you
have
not
any
authority
for
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
haven't
any
authority
in
this
court
for
that,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
have
got
authority
from
this
court
directly
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
this
classification
results
from
legislative
inadvertence
when
congress
enacted
the
law?
i
mean,
they...
it
is
an
enrolled
bill.
unknown
speaker
then
that
is
really
a
statutory
construction,
isn't
it,
as
to...
the
one
you
were
making
before
lunch
as
to
which
should
be
applied.
unknown
speaker
how
long
after
the
event
did
congress
say
what
you
have
just
read?
unknown
speaker
you
said
1981?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
this
subsequent
legislative
history
is
pretty
good
evidence
as
to
what
the
prior
law
meant?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
same
time,
congress
did
change
the
impact
of
this
difference
to
some
extent,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
they
were
legislating
in
this
area
at
the
time,
in
the
comparability
area.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
must
have
been...
do
you
think
congress
by
that
time
was
aware
of
this
distinction
that
you
are
now
attacking?
unknown
speaker
so
you
get
flatly
contrary
indications
from
this
later
legislative
history
on
the
question
before
us
now
than
does
the
solicitor
general.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
other...
your
opposition
says
that
this
later
legislative
history
indicates
congressional
awareness
and
the
determination
to
leave
this
discrimination
in
place.
unknown
speaker
okay,
thanks.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
jones,
what
if
the
district
court
had
said
to
the
plaintiff,
well,
i
see
you
don't
raise
any
statutory
construction
argument,
but
i
have
read
the
statute
and
i
think
there
is
a
very
good
one.
now,
you
can't
make
me
reach
a
constitutional
issue
just
by
your
desire
not
to
raise
the
statutory
issue.
you
would
not
have
thought
the
judge
was
making
an
error,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
some
other
judges
involved
now.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
can
make
us
reach
us
the
constitutional
issue
if
we
don't...
if
there
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
statutory
issue
to
be
disposed
of
you
say
we
must
ignore
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
filed
a
whole
reply
brief
on
it.
unknown
speaker
or
if
we
reach
it,
you
would
say
at
least
we
ought
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
it
so
that
you
can
litigate
the
statutory
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
raised
now.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
isn't
it
probably
true
that
the
people
in
the
appellees'
group
have
worked
a
little
harder
or
a
little
longer?
unknown
speaker
they
have
higher
social
security
benefits,
quite
obviously.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
fair
to
assume
that
if
they
were
paid
more
they
might
have
earned
a...
well,
never
mind.
unknown
speaker
any
such
person
whose
income
is
at
that
level
after
he
has
paid
his
medical
bills.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
treat
net
income
as
income
available
after
medical
bills.
unknown
speaker
if
you
treat
income
as
income
available
after
paying
your
doctor
bills,
then
is
there
a
difference?
