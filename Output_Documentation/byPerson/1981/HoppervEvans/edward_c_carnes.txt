mr.
edward
c.
carnes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
federal
habeas
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
respondent
in
this
case
is
a
murderer
named
evans
who
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
under
the
alabama
capital
punishment
statute,
which
was
later
involved
in
this
court's
decision
in
beck
v.
alabama.
at
this
time
this
court
handed
down
its
beck
decision,
respondent
evans'
conviction
and
sentence
had
already
been
affirmed
by
the
state
appellate
courts.
this
court
had
denied
certiorari,
and
the
district
court
had
denied
the
federal
habeas
petition
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
after
the
beck
decision
was
handed
down,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
denial
of
habeas,
and
held
that
beck
required
that
evans
be
retried
and
resentenced.
it
did
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
case
is
different
from
the
beck
case
in
every
material
way.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
virtually
unique.
early
in
1977,
evans
and
a
co-defendant
named
ritter,
both
of
whom
had
just
been
released
on
parole
from
an
indiana
prison,
began
a
cross-country
crime
spree.
that
crime
spree
lasted
over
two
months,
and
by
their
own
admission,
involved
between
two
and
three
dozen
violent
felonies
committed
in
seven
different
states.
one
of
those
violent
felonies
was
a
robbery
they
committed
of
a
pawn
shop
in
mobile,
alabama,
in
january
of
1977.
it
is
absolutely
undisputed
in
the
record
that
prior
to
that
robbery,
which
is
the
basis
of
this
case,
evans
and
ritter
had
discussed
the
possibility
that
one
of
their
robbery
victims
might
try
to
go
for
a
weapon,
and
that
they
had
agreed
between
themselves
that
if
that
happened
they
would
kill
him.
when
evans
and
ritter
entered
the
pawn
shop
in
mobile,
a
man
named
mr.
nassar
was
working
behind
the
counter.
evans
pulled
a
pistol.
nassar
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
behind
the
counter
and
started
crawling
away.
evans
thought
that
nassar
might
be
going
for
a
gun,
so
he
leaned
over
the
counter
and
deliberately
shot
him
to
death.
they
then
pulled
another
robbery
in
mobile,
and
left
that
state
to
continue
their
crime
spree
in
another
state.
during
the
crime
spree,
and
after
they
had
killed
nassar,
evans
telephoned
an
fbi
agent
in
his
home
town
and
offered
to
turn
himself
in
if
that
fbi
agent
could
guarantee
evans
that
he
would
be
executed
when
he
turned
himself
in.
the
agent
told
evans
he
couldn't
make
him
any
promises,
and
for
that
reason
evans
refused
to
turn
himself
in.
that
is
from
evans'
own
sworn
testimony
at
the
grand
jury.
after
more
robberies,
evans
and
ritter
were
finally
captured
in
little
rock,
arkansas,
by
fbi
agents
in
march
of
1977.
from
the
very
beginning,
instead
of
contesting
his
guilt,
evans
admitted
it
and
bragged
about
it.
he
confessed
to
the
robbery
and
murder
of
nassar
and
the
two
to
three
dozen
other
violent
felonies
he
had
committed
to
the
fbi
agent
who
captured
him
within
hours
of
his
capture,
to
the
mobile
police
officers
after
he
waived
extradition
and
was
returned
to
alabama,
and
to
the
news
media
at
every
available
opportunity.
evans
insisted
that
he
wanted
to
be
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
for
the
murder,
and
his
insistence
on
that
so
frustrated
his
attorneys
that
they
arranged
through
the
court
to
have
evans
examined
by
a
psychiatrist.
the
psychiatrist
did
examine
evans,
and
he
reported
back
to
the
court
that
evans
was
competent
and
rational,
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong,
that
he
thoroughly
understood
the
nature
and
consequences
of
his
actions,
and
that
he
sincerely
preferred
execution
to
a
long
term
in
prison.
before
that,
evans
had
voluntarily
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
over
the
objections
of
his
attorney,
and
had
testified
under
oath
to
the
grand
jury
that
he
had
robbed
and
murdered
mr.
nassar,
that
he
fully
understood
what
he
was
doing,
that
nassar
was
not
the
first
person
he
had
killed,
and
that
he
would
kill
again
in
the
same
situation.
evans
also
testified
to
the
grand
jury
that
he
preferred
execution
over
life
in
prison.
then,
at
arraignment,
evans
pleaded
guilty.
the
judge
entered
evans'
guilty
plea
in
the
official
minutes
of
the
court,
but
nonetheless
scheduled
the
case
for
trial,
because
that
is
the
peculiar
procedure
in
alabama
capital
case
guilty
pleas.
at
the
trial,
the
state
presented
overwhelming
evidence
of
evans'
guilt,
including
the
testimony
of
eye
witnesses
and
undisputed
scientific
evidence.
after
the
state
had
rested
its
case,
evans
filed
a
written
motion
to
plead
guilty,
which
was
accepted
into
evidence
and
went
to
the
jury.
then
evans
took--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--no
dispute
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
your
honor,
he,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
told
the
jury
that
at
the
trial,
and
he
told
the
grand
jury
that.
in
the
trial
testimony
on
page
38
of
the
appendix,
he
said,
"our
whole
trip
was
based
on
robbery.
"
"kind
of
a
spree.
"
"it
was
well
planned,
and
i've
been
in
crime
a
long
time.
"
"before
you
go
back
in
there,
the
only
thing
i've
got
to
say
to
the
jury
is
that
i've
been
at
it
a
long
time,
and
if
you
don't
come
back
with
a
death
sentence,
which
is
the
only
other
thing
i
can
think
you
can
come
out
with,
i'm
going
to
get
out
and
i'm
going
to
do
it
again.
"
"there's
not
any
question
whatsoever.
"
evans,
in
addition
to
testifying
to
that
before
the
trial
jury,
also
testified
under
examination
by
the
district
attorney
that
he
felt
no
remorse
about
the
killing,
and
that
he
wouldn't
hesitate
to
kill
again
in
the
same
situation.
he
also
admitted
that
his
attorneys
had
advised
him
some
20
to
30
times
not
to
take
the
course
of
action
he
was
taking
at
trial.
there
were
absolutely
no
lesser
included
offense
evidence
of
any
kind
whatsoever
presented
at
the
trial.
the
jury
took
less
than
15
minutes
to
convict
him.
the
next
day,
the
judge
held
a
sentence
hearing,
and
after
weighing
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
found
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
far
outweighed
the
mitigating,
and
then
the
judge
sentenced
evans
to
death,
as
he
had
requested
all
along
to
be
sentenced.
after
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
alabama
appellate
courts
and
this
court
denied
cert,
the
habeas
petition,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
court,
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
in
mobile.
that
habeas
petition--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--excuse
me.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
no,
your
honor.
under
alabama
law,
what
we
have
is
a
coram
nobis
petition,
which
is
the
same
thing,
but
under
alabama
law
you
can't
raise
in
a
coram
nobis
petition
any
issues
that
you
could
have
raised
on
appeal
but
didn't,
and
also,
there's
a
very
strong
line
of
authority
in
alabama
law
that
you
can't
file
a
coram
nobis
petition
or
have
any
kind
of
collateral
review
unless
you
aver
that
you're
innocent,
something
which,
of
course,
no
attorney
representing
evans
could
do.
so,
we
have
conceded
from
the
very
beginning
that
he
had
exhausted
any
state
court
remedies
to
have
his
federal
claims
aired
in
state
court.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
could
not
have
been
raised.
it
would
have
been
rejected
without
any
answer
at
all
being
required
by
the
state.
the
federal
habeas
petition
that
evans
filed
in
federal
district
court,
or
that
his
new
attorneys
filed
for
him,
did
aver
that
the
preclusion
clause
contained
in
the
alabama
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
prohibited
jury
instructions
when
there
was
evidence
to
support
them,
something
this
court
later
found
in
the
beck
case.
however,
the
habeas
petition
in
this
case
did
not
aver
that
there
was
no
evidence...
that
there
was
any
evidence
to
support
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
in
this
case,
and
the
habeas
petition
did
not
aver
that
evans
had
been
harmed,
affected,
or
influenced
in
any
way
by
the
preclusion
clause.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
habeas
hearing,
evans,
through
his
attorneys,
insisted
that
he
was
attacking
the
statute
only
on
its
face
and
as
applied
statewide
instead
of
for
whatever
reason
it
may
have
affected
him.
the
district--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--no,
your
honor,
he
surely
didn't.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
habeas
transcript,
his
attorneys'
remarks
on
the
habeas
transcript,
pages
34
and
43,
they
specifically
say
that
he
is
not
attacking
it
because
of
anything
it
did
to
him.
quoting
his
attorney
in
the
lower
court
on
page
34
of
the
hearing
transcript,
"first
of
all,
we
are
not
going
to
argue
whether
or
not
capital
punishment
is
good
or
bad,
or
argue
whether
anything
regarding
the
statute
in
particular
was
applied
in
mr.
evans'
case
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
applied.
"
"what
we
will
be
arguing
here
is
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
alabama
death
penalty
statute
both
on
its
face
and
as
it
has
been
applied
in
the
state
of
alabama.
"
meaning
statewide
in
other
cases.
they
essentially
attempted
to
use
the
habeas
petition
as
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
i
doubt
if
even...
they
would
have
had
even
enough
standing
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition.
then,
after
the
beck
decision
was
released,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed.
to
the
state's
argument
that
evans
had
never
even
argued
that
he
was
harmed,
affected,
or
in
any
way
influenced
by
the
preclusion
clause,
the
fifth
circuit
replied,
"however
persuasive
this
argument
might
otherwise
be,
it
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
supreme
court.
"
what
the
fifth
circuit
thought
foreclosed
it
from
making
any
inquiry
into
harm
and
prejudice
was
the
paragraph
on
pages
642
and
643
of
justice
stevens'
opinion,
where
this
court
said
that,
"in
every
case
we
think",
meaning
in
every
case
being
discussed,
"the
alabama
statute
would
lead
to
unreliable
fact
finding.
"
in
lifting
those
three
words,
"in
every
case",
out
of
context,
and
misinterpreting
them,
the
fifth
circuit
ignored
the
fact
that
the
cert
question
was
very
carefully
limited
in
beck
to
cases
in
which
there
was
factual
evidence
to
support
a
lesser
offense
verdict.
also,
this
court's
holding
on
the
very
first
page
of
the
beck
opinion
says,
"we
hold
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
imposed
under
these
circumstances.
"
referring
to
circumstances
in
which
there
was
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
there
is
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
there
were...
reading
the
alabama
supreme
court's
beck
opinion
on
remand,
there
were
at
least
50,
plus,
from
the
time
of
that...
my
best
estimate
is,
there
were
more
than
60.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
more
than
60
pre-beck
convictions
and
sentences.
of
that
number,
your
honor,
we
have
conceded
that
all
but,
at
the
outside,
ten
are
entitled
to
retrial
under
the
beck
decision.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
it's
evans,
ritter,
six
more
before
this
court
now,
and
perhaps
two
more
in
the
state
courts.
this
is
our
most
compelling
case,
and
this
court
could
conceivably
issue
a
decision
in
this
case
that
evans,
and
by
extrapolation
ritter,
were
valid
and
should
be
affirmed
and
not
set
aside,
but
that
the
others
were,
because
in
none
of
the
other
cases
did
people
follow
the
unusual
and
unique
course
of
action
that
evans
and
ritter
did
here
at
the
trial.
the
frustrating
thing--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--yes,
sir,
all.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
without
question.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes.
without
question.
the
other
cases
are
primarily,
though
i
don't
think
entirely,
cases
where
there
was
an
alibi,
where
the
defense
essentially
was,
well,
whoever
did
it
surely
did
it.
that's
the
capital
offense.
but
i
was
200
miles
away
with
my
girlfriend.
here
we
go
beyond
that.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
in
the
initial
opinion,
they
said,
well,
the
state
is
being
fundamentally
unfair
to
mr.
evans.
first,
they
told
him
there
was
no
lesser
offense,
and
now
they
are
saying,
we
ought
to
affirm
his
death
sentence
because
he
didn't
present
evidence
of
a
lesser
offense.
that
might
be
a
valid
argument
for
those
other
cases,
but
in
this
case
they
ignored
our
argument
where
we
said,
look,
not
only
was
there
no
evidence,
but
we
can
show
you
from
this
unusual,
extraordinary
record
that
evans
was
not
influenced
in
any
way,
that
he
would
not
have
presented
any
evidence
of
any
lesser
included
offense,
that
he
launched
this
self-destructive
legal
course
before
he
was
even
captured,
much
less
before
he
knew
anything
about
the
preclusion
clause.
when
we
argued
that,
then
the
fifth
circuit
came
back
and
said,
oh,
well,
in
effect,
saying,
oh,
well,
even
if
you're
right,
we
are
foreclosed
by
the
"in
every
case"
language
of
beck.
the
frustrating
thing
about
that
was
that
it
seemed
so
clear
to
me
that
in
beck
what
this
court
was
talking
about
was
that
in
every
case
where
there
was
lesser
offense
evidence,
there
would
be
pressure
on
the
jury
not
to
acquit
the
capital
offense
because
the
jury
was
convinced
the
man
was
guilty
of
a
serious
lesser
offense.
you
can't
have
the
jury
convinced
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
serious
lesser
offense
unless
there
is
some
evidence
that
places
in
dispute
an
element
of
the
higher
offense
not
necessary
to
the
lower
offense.
no
jury
could
rationally,
anywhere,
say
that
evans
might
be
guilty
of
a
serious
lesser
offense
instead
of
the
capital
offense.
your
opinion
seemed
so
clear,
but
the
fifth
circuit
just
wouldn't
see
it.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
beck
itself
does
not
mandate
reversal
in
this
case,
harm
and
prejudice
is
necessary.
it's
necessary
because
this
court's
decisions
recognize
that
there
is
a
general
requirement
of
harm
and
prejudice
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation
in
any
case,
with
two
exceptions.
one
is
where
there
is
a
specific
bill
of
right
guarantee
involved,
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
and
the
other
is
where
there
is
a
denial
of
a
procedural
right
which
has
been
specifically
recognized
as
encompassed
within
the
right
to
fair
trial.
the
best
example
i
know
of
this
is
the
beck
case
itself.
this
court
recognized
at
least
in
death
cases
that
the
giving
of
lesser
included
offenses
when
the
evidence
justified
them
was
necessary
to
a
fair
trial,
specifically
and
necessary,
but
that
doesn't
control
this
case,
because
this
court
has
never
held,
and
no
court
has
ever
held
that
giving
lesser
included
offense
instructions
when
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
it
was
necessary
for
a
fair
trial.
instead,
their
contention
basically,
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
probably
is
saying
is
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair,
the
existence
of
the
preclusion
clause
itself
was
unfair
and
detrimental.
every
fundamental
fairness
claim
this
court
has
ever
decided,
it
has
required
a
showing
of
harm
and
prejudice.
the
burden
to
prove
harm
and
prejudice
should
be
on
evans,
not
only
because
it
is
part
of
his
claim,
a
threshold
part
of
his
claim,
but
also
because
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case.
the
interesting
thing
about
both
the
fifth
circuit
opinions
is,
after
they
said
initially
this
is
a
habeas
case
in
the
southern
district
of
alabama,
they
never
again
mentioned
habeas
corpus.
also,
evans,
in
this
court,
his
entire
brief,
beside
a
passing
reference,
the
references
to
this
habeas
case,
never
discusses
the
significance
of
this
being
a
habeas
corpus
case.
they
ignore
entirely
henderson
v.
kibbe,
where
this
court
said
that
not
only
did
you
have
to
show
prejudice,
but
you
had
to
show
more
than
you
would
show
in
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
your
honor,
it
is
more
an
interpretation
of
this
court--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--my
understanding
is,
this
court
has
said
it's
in
the
constitution
by--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--it
is
not
on
the
boldfaced
lettering
of
the
constitution.
it
is
within
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
and
other
cases--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
we
also
find
support
for
our
position
that
this
is
a
specially
significant
case
because
it
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
from
mr.
justice
stevens'
separate
opinion
earlier
this
month
in
rose
v.
lundy.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
and
they
argue
here,
that
chapman
v.
california
placed
the
burden
on
the
state
to
disprove
harm
and
prejudice
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
wrong
because
chapman
applies,
as
it
said,
only
where
a
constitutional
violation
is
first
established.
no
constitutional
violation
has
been
established
in
this
case.
instead,
harm
and
prejudice
is
a
threshold
requirement
to
their
fundamental
fairness
claim.
if
this
were
a
case
where
lesser
included
offense
instructions
should
have
been
given
because
there
was
evidence
for
them,
then
chapman
would
apply,
but
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
for
lesser
offense
instructions
absent
evidence
for
them.
but
in
any
event,
perhaps
it
is
a
moot
argument,
because
the
record
in
this
case
not
only
does
not
support
evans'
contention
that
he
was
harmed
or
prejudiced
or
any
conceivable
contention,
but
it
also
disproves
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
beyond
any
doubt
any
harm
or
prejudice
on
evans.
it
shows
there
was
none.
it
shows
it
in
two
ways,
first,
because
there
was
no
evidence
at
trial
at
all
to
support
it,
and
then
also
because
it
shows
that
the
preclusion
clause
didn't
influence
or
affect
his
course
of
action.
the
best
way
to
point
this
out
is
from
the
crucial,
decisive,
absolutely
undisputed
fact
that
evans,
according
to
his
own
sworn
statements,
began
this
self-destructive
course
of
action
before
he
knew
anything
at
all
about
the
preclusion
clause.
also,
the
record,
which
is
unusually
complete,
does
not
reflect
that
the
existence
of
the
preclusion
clause
after
he
learned
of
it
had
any
reinforcement
effect
whatsoever.
he
started
certainly
when
he
called
the
fbi
agent
and
said,
i'll
turn
myself
in
if
you
can
guarantee
me
you'll
be
executed.
he
hadn't
heard
of
the
preclusion
clause.
he
hadn't
heard
of
the
mandatory
verdict
form
requirement
or
anything
of
that
nature.
the
jury
verdict
form
requirement
is
an
alternative
grounds
that
they
assert
this
case
should
be
reversed
on.
now,
this,
alabama's
pre-beck
capital
punishment
statute,
the
one
evans
was
tried
under,
was
not
a
mandatory
death
penalty
statute,
as
witnessed
by
the
undisputed
fact
that
the
judge
was
the
sentencing
authority,
and
also
page
67
of
this
record
shows
that
roughly
a
third
of
the
convictions
were
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
the
problem
was,
it
appeared
from
the
jury's
perspective,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
beck,
to
be
a
mandatory
one,
because
the
jury
wasn't
told
of
the
judge's
later
sentencing
function.
our
response
to
that
is,
fine,
but
according
to
beck
and
according
to
any
reasoned
analysis,
the
verdict
form
requirement
could
have
only
two
conceivable
effects.
one
would
be
at
the
guilt
stage
where,
according
to
the
historical
information
in
earlier
cases,
it
might
impermissibly
encourage
the
jury
to
acquit.
our
response
to
that
is,
so
what?
why
should
evans
be
allowed
to
complain
because
his
jury
was
impermissibly
encouraged
to
acquit
him?
he
was
convicted
in
spite
of
the
preclusion
clause
and
not
because
of
it.
the
second
conceivable
effect
would
be
at
the
sentence
stage,
where
the
fact
that
the
jury
had
reached
a
sentencing
decision
that
had
been
publicly
announced
before
the
judge
came
to
making
his
decision
could
conceivably
impermissibly
encourage
the
judge
to
pronounce
a
sentence
of
death,
something
that
was
alluded
to
in
beck.
our
position
on
that
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
sentencing
errors
never
have
been
held
to
invalidate
otherwise
reliable
convictions.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
didn't
just
say,
go
back
and
resentence
evans.
they
said,
go
back
and
retry
him.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes.
the
specific
holding
said
that,
but
we
have
read
it
and
interpreted
it
and
conceded
it
from
our
first
reading
of
it
that
we
had
to
retry.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
the
second
position
on
the
mandatory
verdict
form
requirement
is
that
it
could
not
conceivably
have
affected
even
evans'
sentence
in
this
particular
case,
because
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
evans
had
asked
to
be
executed,
before
he
was
captured,
throughout
the
grand
jury,
the
trial,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
any
other
sentence
was
inconceivable,
not
only
because
evans
asked
for
it,
but
also
because
he
expressed
no
remorse,
and
told
everybody,
the
jury,
the
judge,
everybody,
"i'm
going
to
do
it
again.
"
so,
basically
what
we
say
here
is,
even
if
the
jury
verdict
form
requirement
was
constitutional
error
insofar
as
the
sentence
was
concerned,
the
record
proves
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
chapman
analysis,
it
was
harmless
error.
there
is
also
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
in
this
case...
for
affirming
the
conviction,
reversing
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
guilty
plea.
alabama
has
an
unusual
guilty
plea
in
capital
cases
rule.
the
guilty
plea
rule
basically
is
that
a
guilty
plea
in
a
capital
case
is
given
effect,
but
the
case
must
still
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
under
alabama's
unusual
rule,
the
formula
is
something
like
this.
a
guilty
plea
plus
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict
of
guilt
equal
a
waiver
on
appeal
of
non-jurisdictional
defects.
on
appeal,
the
alabama
courts
did
in
this
case
consider
the
constitutional
issues
about
the
statute.
they
had
to
in
the
process
of
determining
whether
there
were
any
jurisdictional
defects,
because
there's
a
two-step
process.
one,
are
there
any
defects,
any
unconstitutional
parts
of
the
statute?
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
then
they
have
to
say,
well,
are
these
severable
or
non-severable,
because
under
brady,
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
severable
part
of
the
statute
is
waived,
but
in
alabama
law
and
virtually
every
other
law,
if
some
part
of
the
statute
had
been
determined
to
be
unconstitutional
at
the
threshold
inquiry,
and
then
had
been
determined
to
be
non-severable,
then
the
entire
statute
would
have
fallen.
the
conviction
would
have
been
void
ab
initio,
and
the
court
would
not
have
had
power
to
convict
and
sentence
evans
under
the
statute,
and
we
would
have
conceded
it
was
jurisdictional
error.
that
is
why
they
approached
that
inquiry
in
this
particular
case.
to
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
that
evans'
guilty
plea
did
not
waive
the
preclusion
clause
because
it
was
limited
to
a
waiver
of
antecedent
defects,
we
have
two
responses.
our
first
response
is,
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statutory
provision
on
preclusion
clause
existed
from
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
was
in
existence
at
the
time
that
the
evans
case
went
to
trial.
therefore,
it
was
an
antecedent
defect.
secondly,
even
if
it
wasn't,
under
menna
v.
new
york,
the
effect
of
a
guilty
plea
is
to
render
irrelevant
anything
that
is
logically
consistent
with
the
factual
guilt,
and
that
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
factual
guilt
once
it's
established.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
your
honor.
it
said,
the
state
may
not
impose
the
sentence
of
death
on
evans
unless
and
until
he
is
retried
and
resentenced.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
i
don't
know
if
they
meant
that
or
just
retried
with
formal
notice
that
he
can
raise
them
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
it
could
mean
you've
got
to
go
back
and
give
him
another
chance
to
say,
well,
let
me
try
to
dream
up
some
lesser
included
offense.
in
other
words,
alabama
law
is
absolutely
clear.
the
ritter
case
on
remand,
four
justices
who
address
it
all
agree
that
you
still
don't
have
to
give
lesser
offense
instructions
unless
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
them.
the
fifth
circuit
might
be
saying,
you've
got
to
tell
him
that
in
advance
and
let
him
run
through
it
again,
and
they
specifically
said,
we're
not
even
going
to
worry
about
whether
he'll
try
that
or
not.
we're
just
going
to
make
the
state
do
it.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
your
honor.
the
reason--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--the
figures
are
roughly--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--there
is.
it
is
my
understanding
we've
got
this
case
plus
the
ritter
case,
five
other
cases
i
mentioned
in
footnote
5
of
ritter,
plus
a
subsequent
cert
case,
timothy
charles
davis,
that,
and
plus
two
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
there
is
either
nine
or
ten.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
yes,
your
honor,
and
those
cases
when
we
didn't
take
cert
were
cases
in
which
there
was
lesser
included
offense
evidence
presented
at
trial
and
it
was
clear
under
this
court's
decision
in
beck
that
they
were
entitled
to
it.
we
didn't
dispute
it.
that's
the
vast
majority
of
them.
somewhere
between
80
and
90
percent
presented
lesser
offense
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided...
the
fifth
circuit
convinced
it,
and
they
cited
the
fifth
circuit
evans
that
the
"in
every
case"
language
of
this
court's
beck
opinion
meant
in
every
case
literally
and
not--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--yes,
your
honor,
but
they
have
emphatically
stated
that
that
is
a
federal
constitutional
holding,
and
if
the
state
has
any
complaint
with
it,
we
should
take
it
before
this
court.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
exactly
what
we've
done,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
will,
of
course,
be
bound
by
this
court's
ruling.
so
there
haven't
been
any
pre-beck
cases
retried
that
there
wasn't
any
lesser
offense.
this
case
would
still
be
here
even
if
certification
had
been
granted--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--for
that
particular
reason.
their
instinctive
self-preservation
argument
is,
we
contend,
frivolous--
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
--no,
sir,
but
this
case
is
here
on
federal
grounds,
we
are
glad
to
have
it
here,
and
we
make
no
contention
at
all
about
that.
their
instinctive
self-preservation
argument
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
because
he
didn't
want
to
kill
anybody
unless
he
had
to,
and
because
he
thought
nassar
was
going
for
a
gun,
somehow
in
alabama
that
would
give
him
a
right
to
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
that
is
absolutely,
flatly
contrary
to
alabama
law.
alabama
law
is
that
if
you
intend
to
kill
somebody
instead
of
accidentally,
and
it
is
in
the
course
of
one
of
the
capital
offense
situations,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
reason
for
it
was.
the
only
time
an
alabama
court
has
ever
been
presented
with
somebody
who
had
the
temerity
to
argue,
i
was
killing
in
self-defense
in
this
robbery
murder
case,
was
reiner
v.
state,
which
is
an
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision
in
1977,
and
they
said,
quite
frankly,
this
is
the
most
novel
claim
that
has
ever
been
made.
they
dismissed
it
out
of
hand.
it
is
simply...
alabama
law
is
simply
clear.
there
was
no
lesser
offense
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
initially.
then
when
we
came
back
and
said,
wait
a
minute,
you
forgot
the
record,
we
will
prove
to
you
by
citing
the
record
that
he
would
not
have
done
it
otherwise.
we
think
the
burden's
on
him,
but
we
can
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
look
at
page
this,
that,
and
the
other
of
the
record,
his
comments,
what
he
said.
mr.
edward
c.
carnes
but
in
response
to
our
argument
in
that
regard
they
said,
however
persuasive
this
argument
might
otherwise
be,
we
are
foreclosed
by
"in
every
case"
language.
our
position
here
is
that
if
this
preclusion
clause
had
any
effect
at
all
on
evans,
it
actually
encouraged
him
to
present
lesser
offense
evidence.
through
his
own
sworn
testimony,
he
told
everybody
who
would
listen,
from
the
grand
jury,
to
the
trial
jury,
to
the
da,
to
the
new
york
times,
i
want
to
be
free
or
die.
let
me
go
free
or
die.
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
prison.
the
preclusion
clause
guaranteed
him
that
if
he
followed
a
lesser
offense
strategy,
he
would
have
nothing
to
lose.
he
would
go
free
or
die.
now,
those
are
the
cases
they
might
be
able
to
argue,
and
we
would
have
a
tough
time
rebutting
it.
they
will
come
up
and
say,
will
it
enhance
the
risk
of
conviction?
so
that
is
why
i
didn't
do
it.
read
mr.
justice
stevens'
opinion.
our
reply
to
that
is
simply,
it
is
absurd
for
them
to
argue
that
he
was
so
afraid
of
getting
convicted
of
a
capital
offense
by
presenting
lesser
offense
evidence
that
he
actually
went
up
there
and
admitted
the
capital
offense
and
asked
to
be
executed.
their
contention
that
the
evidence
would
have
supported
lesser
offense
instructions
had
it
been
presented
at
trial
is
rebutted
by
the
fact
that
the
three
alabama
justices
who
applied
alabama
law
to
the
record
all
found
on
the
ritter
case
on
remand,
the
three
dissenters
found
that
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
any
lesser
included
offense,
and
that
none
should
have
been
given
otherwise.
chief
justice
tolbert
concurred
with
them.
he
said,
i'll
go
with
the
majority,
that
"in
every
case"
language
seems
to
compel
it,
but
don't
get
confused,
lower
courts,
you
don't
have
to
give
an
instruction
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
it,
implying
that
there
wasn't
in
this
case.
everybody
who
has
ever
reviewed
it,
alabama
has
said,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
it,
and
we
asked
the
fifth
circuit,
we
said,
if
there
is
any
question,
don't
muck
up
alabama
law.
send
the
question
over
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
and
they
refused
to
do
so.
thank
you,
your
honor.
