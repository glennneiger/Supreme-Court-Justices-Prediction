unknown
speaker
there
is
no
dispute
about
all
this
so
far?
unknown
speaker
in
that
statement,
in
one
of
his
statements,
did
he
not
at
least
imply
strongly
that
if
confined,
as
distinguished
from
being
executed,
he
would
escape
and
kill
again?
unknown
speaker
could
you--
unknown
speaker
--tell
me
whether
there
was
any
attempt
made
to
file
a
habeas
petition
in
the
state
courts
first?
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
could
not
have
been
raised
in
a
state
habeas?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
he
did
not
make
the
argument
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
acted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carnes,
at
this
point,
if
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
and
you
lose
this
procedure
here,
in
your
view,
are
you
jeopardizing
all
pre-beck
convictions
in
the
state
of
alabama?
unknown
speaker
how
many
are
there?
unknown
speaker
sixty?
unknown
speaker
under
the
beck
decision?
unknown
speaker
so
that
at
the
outside,
only
ten
then
would
be
affected
by
this
one--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
while
you
are
giving
us
this
summary,
those
that
you
in
effect
concede
were
covered
by
beck,
are
they
all
cases
in
which
the
record
would
have
supported
a
lesser
included
offense?
i
mean,
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
have
justified
it?
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
was
the
theory?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
seven
or
eight
cases
other
than
ritter
and
evans,
i
take
it,
are
cases
in
which
one
cannot
be
as
sure
as
one
might
be
here
that
the
preclusion
clause
didn't
really
affect
it--
unknown
speaker
--what
was
put
into
evidence
or
offered
in
evidence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
what
section
in
the
constitution
says
you
have
to
show
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
in
the
constitution,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you,
where
is
it
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
do
you
find
it
in
the
same
place
where
you
find
the
requirement
that
instruction
be
given
on
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
presumption
of
innocence?
unknown
speaker
i
am
still
asking
where.
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
all
of
them
together
are
trying
to
give
the
answer.
i
mean,
what
amendment
to
the
constitution
or
what
section
of
the
constitution
says
it?
none.
i
will
answer
it.
unknown
speaker
so
did
beck,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
read
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
affirmed,
as
requiring
habeas
relief
in
the
form
of
a
new
trial
on
guilt?
unknown
speaker
retried
with
the
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
unknown
speaker
what
else
could
it
mean?
unknown
speaker
may
death
be
imposed
in
either
event?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
fit
the
evidence
in
this
case,
that
proposition
of
law
that
you
have
just
stated?
unknown
speaker
is
this
an
additional
argument
for
affirmance?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
go
on
that
basis,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
the
exact
testimony
of
other
evidence
that
backs
that
up?
unknown
speaker
did
you
present
this
argument--
--well,
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
this
particular
argument.
unknown
speaker
will
you
give
me
a
page?
page
6
on
the
blue
brief.
unknown
speaker
blue
brief?
unknown
speaker
that
is
his
brief,
the
brief
for
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
blue.
now,
what
page
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
and
i
want
to
know
what
part
of
that
gives
any
basis
for
a
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
else?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
think
anybody
would
get
hurt.
unknown
speaker
with
a
loaded
gun.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
square
that
with
what
he
said
that
you
have
repeated
or
your
friend
repeated
on
page
6
of
the
blue
brief?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
square
the
two
things?
the
argument
you
are
making...
is
this
another
case?
have
i
got
the
wrong
case,
where
he
said,
my
name
is
john
lewis
evans,
and
i
killed
him,
and
i'd
do
it
again,
and
if
you
let
me
out
i'll
do
it
again?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
jury,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
this...
on
page
6?
unknown
speaker
what
part
of
what
is
reproduced
on
page
6
would
have
entitled
him
to
a
lesser
included
offense
charge?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
yes.
that
even
if
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
support
such
an
instruction,
you
nevertheless,
you
are
entitled
to
this
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
haven't
let
you
get
there.
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
this
trial
had
taken
place
after
our
decision
in
beck,
and
the
alabama
court
had
simply
said,
we
know
we
have
to
give
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
included
offense
if
the
evidence
supports
one,
but
here
there
just
isn't
any
evidence
supporting
one.
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
they
still
had
to
give
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
imagine
this
court
or
any
other
court
deciding
that
with
no
evidence
to
support
it
it
was
a
constitutional
requirement
that
you
had
to
give
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
hypothesizing
a
case
that
came
after
beck,
so
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
on
notice
that
he
could
have
an
instruction
if
the
evidence
supported
it.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
i
understand
you
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
trial
record
that
justifies
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
talking
about...
that's
the
only
kind
of
evidence
i
understand,
is
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record,
you
admit
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
justifies
a
charge,
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
was
it
offered?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
can
you
complain
of
if
something
is
not
offered?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
constitutional
provision
gives
you
the
right
to
complain
about
evidence
that
you
didn't
offer?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you
are
here,
though,
on
collateral
attack.
your
argument
is
unbelievable
to
me.
you
are
here
on
a
collateral
attack,
and
under
wainwright
and
sykes,
don't
you
have
to
show
prejudice
and
cause
to
prevail
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
the
statute
struck
down
in
beck?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
rule
struck
down
in
beck?
unknown
speaker
there
was
an
alabama
rule
that
it
wouldn't
have
done
you
any
good
to
offer
evidence
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
because
there
was
a
flat
rule
against
submitting
it
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
so
you
were
told,
don't
offer
evidence.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
let
me
try
again.
you
say
if
you
had
given
the
same
testimony
that
was
given
before
the
grand
jury,
you
would
be
in
a
position
to
have
the
point
raised
about
the
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
in
the
world
stopped
him
from
testifying?
he
was
on
the
stand.
he
could
have
testified
exactly
as
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
and
he
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
rule
of
law
that
said
it
wouldn't
have
done
him
any
good.
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
that
same...
wasn't
that
rule
in
effect
when
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
and
still
he
testified.
unknown
speaker
some
place
i
missed
the
point.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
sub
silentio
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
here?
unknown
speaker
he
was
also
operating
within
the
confines
of
that
statement
which
evans
made
to
the
jury
that
he
did
it
and
he
would
do
it
again
the
first
chance
he
got.
unknown
speaker
his
statement
is
that
he
had
killed
other
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
enough
for
that
one
person,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
beck
had
the
foresight
to
put
in
some
evidence
of
a
lesser
included
offense,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
why
not
hold
this
defendant
to
that
same
standard,
if
he
wants
to
raise
the
beck
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
beck
managed
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
this
was
a
tactical
decision,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
general
rule
is
that
if
you
want
to
save
a
point
or
put
something
in
evidence
and
the
trial
court
refuses
it,
you
make
a
proffer.
unknown
speaker
again
i
come
back,
how
do
you
reconcile
what
you
are
now
saying
with
the
statement
that
he
made
to
the
trial
jury?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
get
the
grand
jury
testimony
before
the
jury
after
he
made
this
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
said
here
he
had
talked
to
the
lawyers,
is
it
20
or
30,
or
30
or
40
times
about
this.
you
are
suggesting
that
after
he
made
this
statement,
he
may
make
one
that
is
quite
contrary
as
you
see
it?
having
just
said,
we
intended
to
do
it,
we
did
it,
i
did
it
before,
and
i'll
do
it
again?
unknown
speaker
has
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
this
question?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
it...
either
way,
has
it
said
that
beck
requires...
must
be
applied
in
a
case
like
this?
it
hasn't
decided
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
right,
but
i
suppose
no
pre-beck
cases
could
get
before
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
attorney
general
is
right,
there
is
no
collateral
relief
available
in
alabama
to
get
this
question
up
on
a
pre-beck
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
there
are
any
cases
like
that
still
in
the
state
system?
unknown
speaker
pre-beck
cases.
well,
mr.
carroll,
aren't
there
about
ten
that
were
pre-beck
cases
that
we
sent
back
at
the
time
we
sent
beck
back,
and
as
to
all
of
those
i
thought
the
alabama
supreme
court
said,
whether
right
or
wrong,
that
they
read
beck
as
requiring
a
new
trial
in
all
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
did
they
ever
explain
why
they
said
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
must
have
then
rejected,
a,
harmless
error,
b,
rejected
the
notion
that
there
hadn't
been
cause
and
prejudice
for
failing
to
object
to
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
they
must
have
done
all
those
things.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
what
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
done?
unknown
speaker
except
this
one?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
if
there
had
been
a
certification,
this
case
wouldn't
be
before
us.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
why
not.
they
would
have
answered
the
case
themselves,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
of
state
law.
well,
i
don't
know.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
he
should
be
stuck
with
the
failure
to
object
to
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
right
on
our
table
now.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
many
pre-beck
cases
are
still
unresolved?
there
is
this
one.
unknown
speaker
from--
unknown
speaker
--four,
five?
unknown
speaker
six.
and
there
have
been
some
cases,
pre-beck
cases
that
were
retried
on--
unknown
speaker
--because
they
were
remanded
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
unknown
speaker
there
weren't
cert
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
agree
with
those
figures?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said...
i
thought
there
was
a
difference
of
one.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
some
cases
that
were
ordered
to
be
retried
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
on
which
cert
wasn't
taken.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
of
the
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
what
you--
--which
is
what
you
have
done
in
these
other
four
or
five
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
urge
that
the
wainwright
against
sykes
rule
applies.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
violates
the
fundamental
notions
of
due
process
to
say
that
he
didn't
present
the
evidence
when
there
was
a
rule
of
law
in
alabama
that
said
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction.
now,
that
is
a
brand
of
wainwright
against
sykes.
you
are
saying...
he
is
arguing
that
i
could
have
presented
evidence
but
i
was
deterred
from
it,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
denies
him
due
process.
unknown
speaker
all
they
did
is
extend
their
opinion.
they
never
changed
a
word
in
their
prior
opinion.
