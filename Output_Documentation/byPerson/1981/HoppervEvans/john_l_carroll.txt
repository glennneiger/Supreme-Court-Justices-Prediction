mr.
john
l.
carroll
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
in
order
to
get
an
adequate
understanding
of
exactly
what
constitutional
issues
we
deal
with
in
this
case,
it's
important
to
understand
the
framework
of
alabama
law
as
it
applies
directly
to
this
particular
situation.
two
points
need
to
be
made.
under
alabama's
capital
statute,
capital
murder
and
felony
murder
are
entirely
different.
felony
murder
is
first
degree
murder.
it
does
not
require
a
showing
of
intent.
capital
murder,
under
the
applicable
decisions
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
require
a
specific
showing
of
intent,
leading
to
the
present
practice
in
alabama
that
juries
are
instructed,
where
the
evidence
supports
such
instruction,
that
a
defendant
may
be
found
guilty
of
capital
murder
if
the
jury
finds
that
he
intentionally
killed
a
particular
victim,
or
he
may
be
found
guilty
of
felony
murder
if
that
intent
is
lacking,
and
that
is
clearly
the
differentiating
factor
under
alabama
law
between
felony
murder
and
capital
murder.
it
is
not
like
many
of
the
other
states.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
death
may
only
be
imposed
in
the
case
of
the
conviction
for
capital
murder.
for
a
conviction
for
felony
murder,
a
life
sentence
with
the
possibility
of
parole
is
the
sentence.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
chief
justice
burger,
our
position
is
really
multifaceted
on
how
that
particular
law
fits
this
case.
we
contend
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
particularly
in
mr.
evans'
grand
jury
testimony,
which
indicates
that
had
that
grand
jury
testimony
been
presented
to
the
trial
jury,
the
trial
judge
would
have
instructed
on
the
lesser
included
offense
of
felony
murder.
it
raises
a
factual
question
about
the
intent
that
mr.
evans
possessed.
we
do
not
say
necessarily
that
these
questions
involve
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
we
only
say
that
they
involve
questions
of,
would
the
trial
judge
have
instructed
the
jury
on
the
lesser
included
offense
of
felony
murder,
and
under
alabama
law,
charges
must
be
given
which
are
supported
by
any
evidence,
however
weak,
insufficient,
or
doubtful
in
credibility.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
this
is
an
additional
argument
for
affirmance,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
can,
your
honor.
it
appears
at
various
places
in
the
appendix,
but
is
set
out
most
recently
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
did
we
present
the
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
this
particular
argument
was
not
presented
exactly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
is
page--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--the
joint
appendix,
pages
12
through
35,
i
believe,
is
mr.
evans'
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
am
talking
about
the
joint
appendix,
justice
marshal.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
joint
appendix,
pages
8
through
pages
23
contain
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
particular...
pardon
me,
of
mr.
evans.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
first
of
all,
justice
marshal,
on
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
mr.
evans
testifies,
"like
i
said,
you
never
want
to
hurt
anybody,
and
we
always
try
to
pick
places
to
rob
that
we
didn't
think
anybody
would
get
hurt.
"
mr.
john
l.
carroll
pardon
me?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
then
on
page
19--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--then
on
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
says,
"i
was
going
to
shoot
him
if
he
reached
for
a
firearm.
"
"of
course,
our
intention
is
always,
you
know,
never
to
hurt
anybody
if
you
don't
have
to.
"
"that's
stupidity.
"
"but
if
it
ever
came
down
to
me
or
somebody
else,
whether
that's
pure
instinct.
"
"that's
self-preservation.
"
"i'm
going
to
fire.
"
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
may
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
this
is
the
same
john
lewis
evans,
and
that's
precisely
the
point,
chief
justice
burger,
is
that
there
is
a
conflict
in
evidence.
he
says
many
different
things
at
many
different
times.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that
is
the
evidence
before
the
trial
jury.
that's
exactly
correct.
our
point
is
not
necessarily,
though
we
contend
that
in
and
of
itself
would
have
been
sufficient
to
support
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
under--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--on
page
6.
on
this
whole
question,
though,
of
harm
and
prejudice,
we
refer
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
as
being
an
example
of
the
kind
of
testimony
that
could
have
been
presented
to
the
trial
jury.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
fact
that
he
says,
"i'm
the
one
that
pulled
the
trigger
during
the
commission
of
a
felony.
"
"it's
a
very
close
question,
and
certainly
not
our
strongest
argument.
"
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
was
working
my
way
there
as
i
was
talking
about
alabama
law.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
let
me--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--let
me
go
back
to
that
particular
point.
again,
the
crucial
difference
between
capital
murder
under
alabama
law
and
first
degree
murder
is
the
question
of
intent,
but
more
importantly,
alabama
has
created
a
procedure
that
some
other
states
have,
certainly
not
the
majority,
for
how
to
deal
with
capital
defendants,
and
their
way
to
deal
with
capital
defendants
is,
always
the
case
is
tried.
you
cannot
plead
guilty
under
alabama
law,
and
the
case
cited
by
both
sides,
the
protho
versus
the
state
of
alabama,
is
the
decision
of
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
indicating
that
is
the
case.
you
cannot
plead
guilty
under
alabama
law.
you
are
entitled
to
have
a
jury
try
the
case,
and
you're
entitled
to
have
a
jury
fix
the
punishment
in
the
case.
now,
what
that
translates
into
is
not
some
sort
of
empty
procedure,
but
in
fact
that
every
case
brought
under
a
capital
indictment
in
alabama
goes
to
a
trial
by
jury,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
voir
dired
the
jury,
he
sequestered
the
witnesses,
he
said
no
one
could
sit
who
could
not
be
fair
and
impartial,
there
was
argument
of
counsel,
there
was
presentation
of
evidence,
there
was
a
charge
to
the
jury,
and
there
was
an
important
part
of
the
charge
to
the
jury
that
i
think
is
worth
noting,
and
that
appears
on
page
44
of
the
joint
appendix.
judge
hoplander,
who
was
the
trial
judge,
charged
the
jury,
"i
can
only
tell
you
that
in
reaching
your
verdict,
you
may
not
take
the
simple
approach
and
say,
if
the
defendant
admits
he
did
it,
we
go
no
further.
"
"you
must
reach
a
verdict
that
is
supported
by
all
of
the
creditable
evidence
that
has
been
presented
to
you
in
this
particular
case.
"
so,
even
the
trial
judge
did
not
see
this
as
an
empty
procedure.
the
question
then
occurs,
how
does
the
beck
decision
and
the
infirmity
in
the
alabama
constitutional...
pardon
me,
the
alabama
death
penalty
law
relate
to
this
particular
statute?
and
the
answer
is
simply
this.
beck
identified
a
fatal
flaw
in
the
alabama
statute,
that
a
jury
was
precluded
from
reaching
a
verdict
on
a
lesser
included
offense
that
was
supported
by
the
evidence.
it
made
the
procedure
in
this
case
as
infirm
as
the
procedure
in
any
other
case,
and
that
flaw
applies
to
cases
like
this,
because
in
every
case
in
alabama,
even
where
there
is
an
attempted
plea
of
guilty,
the
trial
must
be
conducted
in
a
constitutional
fashion.
that's
the
clear
ruling
of
the
alabama
court
and
the
clear
ruling
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
we
would
suggest
that
that
would
frame
an
issue,
a
federal
constitutional
issue
under
this
court's
beck
decision.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
justice
rehnquist,
where
we
clearly
differ
is
how
the
relevant
inquiry
proceeds.
do
we
look
simply
at
the
facts
as
they
were
presented
to
the
jury,
or
do
we
look
further
and
look
at
the
facts
as
they
could
have
been
presented
to
the
jury
had
it
not
been
for
the
preclusion
clause
or
its
existence.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
given
the
state
of
alabama
law,
which
is
this
incredibly
liberal
standard
as
to
what
lesser
included
offense
instructions
you
are
entitled
to,
i
would
find
it
a
rare
case
in
alabama
where
a
trial
jury
in
a
capital
murder
case
was
not
instructed
on
the
issue
of
capital
murder
and
felony
murder.
in
effect,
what
that
would
be
would
be
a
directed
verdict
on
the
issue
of
intent
in
a
capital
case,
and
i
quite
frankly
can't
see
our
alabama
courts
directing
that
kind
of
verdict.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
justice
marshal,
our
position
on
that
point
is
that
the
evidence
as
actually
presented
to
the
trial
jury.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
we
do
not
concede
that
point.
we
would
argue
that
under
the
liberal
standard
of
alabama's
lesser
included
offense
law,
that
trial
testimony
would
support
the
giving
of
a
lesser
included
offense
on
felony
murder
alone,
but
we
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
other
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
more
evidence
could
have
been
presented
to
the
trial
jury.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
was
it
offered
to
the
court
and
then
refused?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no,
it
was
not,
justice
marshal.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
well,
i
think
we
are
into
the
whole
question
of
constitutional
error,
and
what
burdens
are
upon
whom
to
show
what
in
a
particular--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--justice
marshal,
john
evans
was
convicted
and
tried
under
an
unconstitutional
death
penalty
scheme,
as
unconstitutional
as
the
schemes
this
court
struck
down
in
woodson,
as
unconstitutional
as
the
schemes
it
struck
down
in
furman.
in
those
cases,
there
was
no
inquiry
into
what
evidence
was
before
the
trial
jury.
they
were
struck
down
on
their
face.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
under
wainwright
and
sykes,
we
must
show
cause
and
prejudice
if
there
is
some
sort
of
procedural
default.
there
has
been
no
allegation
by
the
state,
and
in
fact
such
an
allegation
would
not
be
true,
that
there
is
a
procedural
default.
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
alabama
death
penalty
statute
was
reserved
by
the
trial
counsel
in
this
case,
presented
to
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
alabama
supreme
court,
so
this
is
a
different
prejudice
or
different
concept
of
prejudice
that
we
deal
with
here.
our
position
as
far
as
prejudice
goes
is
really
threefold.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
the
constitutional
error
in
this
case
is
one
of
those
kinds
of
constitutional
error
where
prejudice
is
to
be
presumed.
it
is
presumed
because
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
on
the
face
of
this
record
what
prejudice
came
to
the
defendant.
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
exactly
what
would
have
happened
under
a
constitutional
statute,
so
that
that
fits
squarely
within
the
lines
of
cases
of
this
court
that
says
prejudice
is
to
be
presumed.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
this--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--the
specific
holding
of
the
court
was
that
the
lesser
included
offense...
that
the
preclusion
of
lesser
included
offense
instructions
was
constitutionally
infirm.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
exactly
right,
justice
white.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
we
were
told
that
offering
evidence
would
mean
nothing.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
but
you
haven't
yet,
at
least
for
my
ear,
mentioned
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
would
hint
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
now,
if
you
have
one,
i
would
like
to
hear
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
trial
record...
there
is
a
close
question
on
the
evidence
as
actually
presented
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
of
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
but
the
defendant's
grand
jury
testimony,
had
that
been
presented
to
the
trial
jury,
would
clearly
have
warranted
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction,
which
brings
me
into
the
next
cog
of
our
argument
on
prejudice.
again,
it's
our
position
in
the
case
that
this
is
an
eighth
amendment
case,
that
this
court
has
never
said
in
the
past
that
it
is
not...
that
it
requires
prejudice
when
there's
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
even
if
this
is
not
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
this
is
a
fundamental
right
which
infects
the
entire
trial
process,
the
method
by
which
evidence
is
assembled
into
the
record.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
right,
justice
marshal.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
he
certainly
could
have.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
he
didn't.
why
he
didn't,
we
don't
know,
and
that
is
precisely
the
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
was
a
rule
of
law
that
said
it
wouldn't
have
done
him
any
good.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
yes,
it
was.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
still
he
testified.
but
he
could
not
have
had
his
jury
reach
a
felony
murder
or
first
degree
murder
verdict.
he
could
not
have
been
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
under
alabama
law.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
again,
the
basic
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
this
is
an
eighth
amendment
violation
and
prejudice
must
be
presumed,
or
it
is
a
fundamental
type
of
fourteenth
amendment
violation
from
which
prejudice
must
be
presumed.
in
addition,
even
if
the
court
finds
that
prejudice
is
not
to
be
presumed
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
is
the
state's
burden
to
prove
that
the
error
in
this
case
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
quite
frankly,
the
points
that
have
just
been
raised...
we
don't
know
why
he
did
certain
things,
we
don't
know
why
certain
things
occurred...
indicate
the
impossibility
of
the
state
carrying
their
burden
of
proof
that
this
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
we
have
never
suggested
that
there
was,
chief
justice
burger.
the
counsel
was
operating
within
the
incredible
confines
of
this
alabama
death
penalty
law,
which
said
you
can
do
anything,
you
can
work,
you
can
do
anything,
you
can
put
evidence
in
the
record,
but
the
jury
cannot
consider
that.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
also
within
the
confines
of
the
statement
that
he
gave
to
the
grand
jury
that
it
was
instinct,
that
it
was
reflex,
that
it
was
self-preservation,
that
they
never
went
into
the
store
to
harm
anybody,
and
in
fact
in
this
alleged
crime
spree
that
evans
and
ritter
went
through,
they
never
harmed
anybody
during
the
course
of
that
crime
spree.
there
is
no
other
homicide,
and
evans
left
two
live
witnesses
in
the
pawn
shop.
there
were
two
children.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
is
one
reference
in
his
statement--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--no
question,
chief
justice
burger,
but
this
crime
spree
that
the
state
makes
so
much
about,
there
were
no
allegations
that
another
homicide
had
occurred
during
that
crime
spree.
again,
what
the
state
asks
this
court
to
do
is
turn
this
whole
question
of
harm,
prejudice,
and
who
must
do
what
on
its
ear,
and
create
some
new
rules
because
of
this
case
for
the
questions
of
how
harm
and
prejudice
are
to
be
determined.
again,
this
is
the
kind
of
violation,
either
an
eighth
amendment
violation
or
the
kind
of
due
process
violation,
because
of
its
effect
on
the
whole
trial
process.
it's
a
structural
problem.
it
infected
the
entire
structure
of
capital
cases
tried
under
this
particular
law.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
he
did,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
tortured
interpretation
of
the
law
to
say...
to
hold
somebody
to
putting
evidence
in
the
record
when
it
would
have
done
him
no
good.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that
was
a
tactical
decision
by
his
counsel.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
again,
unfortunately
or
fortunately,
we
really
can
only
speculate
as
to
why
these
things
happened.
the
state
has
a
version
of
facts
as
to
why
they
happened.
we
have
a
version
of
facts
as
to
why
they
happened.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
and
i
think
what
we
are
into
now
is
a
debate
over
what
was
the
best
course
of
action.
was
it
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
or
was
it
to
put
evidence
in
and
say
that
this
was
the
result
of
the
statute
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
don't
think
the
law
requires
you
to
do
both.
and
in
fact
the
statute
itself
may
have
compelled
some
of
the
behavior
in
this
particular
case,
the
fact
that
the
either-or
option,
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole
or
the
death
sentence,
were
the
only
things
that
john
evans
faced
in
the
case.
there
was
no
realistic
possibility
of
acquittal.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
may
be
no
way
to
reconcile
those
questions,
but
they
clearly
raise
an
intent
issue,
an
intent
issue
that
the
jury
should
have
decided.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
by
suggesting
to
the
defendant
that
he
testify
as
he
did
before
the
grand
jury,
or
by
referencing
that
in
some
fashion.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
was
again
a
question
which
we
contend
was
resolvable
by
a
jury.
somebody
had
to
make
that
decision.
which
was
the
correct
statement?
was
it
that
he
went
in
with
no
intent
to
kill
and
as
a
reflex
action
shot
the
individual,
or
was
it
the
question
of
what
he
testified
at
trial?
that
is
precisely
the
problem.
a
jury
should
have
decided
this
question
of
intent,
and
that
is
really
all
that
we
are
saying,
is
that
because
of
the
lesser
included
offense
preclusion,
the
jury
did
not
have
the
opportunity
in
this
case
to
decide,
as
it
must
decide
under
alabama
law,
whether
or
not
john
evans
was
guilty
of
felony
murder
or
capital
murder.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
this
precise
question?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
has
not,
justice
white.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
it
has
said
nothing
about
this
particular
case.
when
beck
came
back
on
remand
from
this
court,
the
alabama
supreme
court
rewrote
the
alabama
death
penalty
law
to
allow
for
lesser
included
offense
instructions
and
to
put
a
jury
as
the
sentencing
authority.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
no
pre-beck
cases
could
get
before
it.
this
was
the--
--on
a
collateral
relief
or
anything.
this
was
the
only
case
that
had
gotten
outside
of
the
state
court
system.
it
was
in
federal
habeas,
and
the
only
one
of
all
the
capital
cases
that
was
in
federal
court.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that
is
a
possible
interpretation.
quite
frankly,
the
law
surrounding
the
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
in
alabama
is
quite
murky.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
any
cases
like
this?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that's
exactly
right.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
they
eventually
on
remand
in
the
ritter
case
from
this
court
said
that
they
based
their
decision
to
order
new
trials
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
they
must
have
done
all
those
things.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
finally,
this
is
a
capital
case,
and
as
this
court
recently
said
in
the
eddings
case,
where
there
are
doubts,
and
clearly
in
this
case
there
have
to
be
doubts,
again,
all
that
can
be
given
to
this
court
are
the
suppositions
of
both
sides
as
to
what
happened
and
why
certain
things
weren't
done,
why
certain
courses
of
action
were
taken.
in
those
kind
of
cases,
what
the
proper
remedy
to
do
is
remand
this
case
for
a
new
trial,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
ordered
new
trials
in
all
of
the
pre-beck
capital
cases.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
except
this
one,
but
it
was
not
in
front
of
them
at
the
time.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
if
there
had
been
a
certification?
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
don't
think
that's
true,
justice
white.
i
think--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--the
issues
that
the
state
sought
to
have
certified
did
not
involve
any
unsettled
issues
of
state
law.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
that
has
never
been
raised
as
an
issue
in
any
proceeding
in
this
case,
that
i
know
of.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
well,
alabama
has
a
plain
error
rule
which
does
not
require
objection.
there
is
a
question,
rule
39(k),
which
is
the
alabama
plain
error
rule,
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
it
could
retroactively
be
applied
to
him.
there
is
one
decision
that
is
worth
mentioning,
and
that
is
the
lane
decision,
which
the
state
mentions
in
its
brief.
the
alabama
supreme
court
recently
held
that
in
a
guilty
plea
case
where
there
is
a
plea
bargain
in
a
capital
case,
that
a
guilty
plea
in
those
situations
which
results
in
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole
waives
all
jurisdictional
defects.
we
disagree
as
to
the
interpretation
of
that
case.
mr.
carnes
seems
to
say
that
somehow
resolves
the
issue,
but
it's
clear
that
applies
only
to
cases
where
the
sentence
is
to
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole
and
would
not
apply
to
this
particular
case.
again,
this
is
a
capital
case.
i
think
there
are
some
significant
doubts
as
to
what
harm
and
prejudice
came
to
the
defendant.
we
contend
you
need
not
reach
that,
because
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
prejudice,
the
kind
of
constitutional
violation
where
prejudice
ought
to
be
presumed,
or
at
a
minimum,
that
the
state
must
prove
harm
or
lack
of
harm
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
as
this
court
said
many
years
ago
in
chessman
versus
teaks,
no
matter
how
heinous
the
crime
in
question
and
no
matter
how
guilty
an
accused
may
ultimately
be
found
to
be
after
guilt
has
been
established
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
demanded
by
the
constitution,
he
is
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
there
are
now...
there
is
this
one,
and
five
cases
where
cert
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
from
the
alabama
supreme
court's
decision
to
order
retrials.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
six.
mr.
john
l.
carroll
i
have
tried
two
pre-beck
cases
myself
already,
and
there...
the
great,
great
majority--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--because
they
were
remanded
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
new
trials.
those
retrials
have
occurred,
and
they
are
now
in
the
process
of
going
back
for--
mr.
john
l.
carroll
--there
weren't
cert
in
any
of
those
cases.
thank
you.
