mr.
laurel
g.
weir
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
filed
this
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
north
district
of
mississippi,
aberdeen,
mississippi,
originally
by
five
people
representing
the
citizens
of
each
one
of
the
five
supervisor
districts
of
winston
county,
mississippi.
we
alleged
that
the
one-man,
one-vote
rule
was
being
violated
and
we
thought
there
was
no
doubt
but
what
it
was.
it
had
continuously
been
done
and
since
even
before
the
voting
rights
act
vast
groups
of
citizens
from
time
to
time
tried
to
get
that
remedied.
even
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
mississippi
saw
that
the
one-man,
one-vote
theory
was
being
violated
and
they
even
enacted
a
statute
before
the
voting
rights
act
took
effect.
no
one
was
ever
successful
in
court
or
in
the
legislature
or
anywhere
else
to
get
relief.
so
i
filed
a
suit
for
the
citizens
of
the
county.
there
are
more
people
living
outside
the
city
limits
than
live
inside
the
city
limits.
there
are
vastly
more
students
attending
the
school
system
that
reside
outside
of
the
city
limits
as
compared
to
inside
the
city
limits.
when
we
got
to
the
u.s.
district
court...
this
is
back
about
seven
years
ago,
july
of
1975,
before
the
people
could
ever
get
a
hearing
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
the
united
states
district
court
ruled
as
a
matter
of
comity
that
the
federal
court
did
have
jurisdiction
of
the
matter,
true
enough,
and
that
there
were
federal
questions
raised
there,
the
one-man,
one-vote
theory
undoubtedly
and
undisputedly
being
violated.
but
he
thought
that
it
was
better...
and
there
are
many
federal
decisions
to
uphold
his
theory...
that
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
state
courts
ought
to
first
be
granted
the
right
to
pass
upon
those
matters.
and
he
put
in
his
order
of
july
1,
1975,
that
he
retained
jurisdiction
and
gave
the
citizens
60
days
in
which
to
file
a
suit
in
the
state
court.
if
they
didn't
file
a
suit
within
60
days
the
case
was
to
be
dismissed.
in
his
order
he
cited
four
federal
decisions.
you
can
read
it
in
the
record
on
pages
80
and
81:
meridian
versus
bell
telephone
company...
i
have
the
citation
that
he
gave.
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
it's
in
the
record
that's
come
up
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
i
have
it
in
the
brief.
it's
on
pages...
i
just
made
a
note
of
what
page
it
appeared
on.
80
and
81
is
where
it
appears
in
the
record
that
came
up
from
the
state
supreme
court.
well,
we
promptly
filed
our
suit
in
the
state
court
and
we...
they
all
agreed
and
we
dictated
and
stipulated
into
the
record
that
all
supervisor
districts
were
in
compliance
with
the
justice
department
rules
and
that
all
five
of
the
supervisor
districts
do
come
into
the
city
limits
of
the
city
of
louisville,
mississippi.
and
it
was
long
after
that
until
any
black
ever
served
on
the
board
of
trustees
for
the
louisville
municipal
separate
school
district.
mr.
mayo
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
one
had
been
appointed.
it
was
only
after
the
state
court
ordered
him
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
united
states
department
of
justice
that
a
black
ever
served
on
the
school
board
under
the
appointed
system.
they
got
a
white
person
to
resign
so
they
could
appoint
a
black
lady
to
serve
as
school
board
trustee.
she's
the
one
and
only
lady
that
has
ever
served
under
the
appointive
system
on
the
school
board,
and
that
was
only
recently,
after
the
court
ordered
that
the
plan
be
submitted
to
the
justice
department.
they
got
a
person
to
resign
and
then
appointed
a
black.
she's
out
of
office
now.
she
got
beat
in
the
election,
too,
like
the
other
four.
all
five...
when
the
people
did
get
a
chance
to
vote
and
an
opportunity
to
vote,
every
trustee
that
was
in
office
ran
for
reelection
also
and
every
one
of
them
got
beat
in
the
election,
too.
and
the
majority
of
the
people...
like
i
say,
there
are
more
people
living
outside
of
the
city
limits
than
live
inside.
there
are
more
people
being
outside
the
city
limits
than
inside.
but
it
was
not
only
white
people
that
were
not
being
permitted
to
vote.
the
blacks
that
lived
outside
the
city
limits
were
deprived
of
their
right
to
vote.
the
indians
that
lived
outside
the
city
limits
of
louisville,
mississippi,
were
being
deprived
of
their
right
to
vote
just
like
the
white
people.
and
so,
when
we
filed
the
lawsuit
we
filed
it
as
more
or
less
a
class
action
in
behalf
of
reds,
blacks,
whites,
and
the
concerned
citizens.
then
after
this
matter
got
back
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court
ruling
that
the
chancellor
must
have
an
election...
and
they
ought
to
be
congratulated
on
the
opinion
they
wrote
in
that
case,
because
they
called
attention
to
the
bench
and
bar
of
the
federal
point
that...
and
it's
in
the
appendix,
their
opinion...
that
the
one-man,
one-vote
law
must
be
complied
with
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
however,
they
said
they
didn't
have
to
reach
that
point
since
there
was
already
a
statute
that
said
that
they
did
have
to
have
an
election.
but
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
statute
they
would
still
have
called
an
election
because
of
the
one-man,
one-vote
theory
being
violated,
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
laws
of
the
land
as
announced
by
this
court.
now,
he
brought
mr.
mayo...
and
one
of
the
justices
here
i
believe
was
concerned
about,
should
they
put
the
old
trustees
back
in
office
in
the
event
of
a
reversal.
let
me
call
your
attention
to
this
factor:
the
court
ruled
that
the
trustees
that
were
serving
were
never
legal
trustees
at
all,
and
the
court
order
just
provided
that
they
could
only
continue
to
serve
until
they
could
have
the
election
and
the
election
should
be
held
as
soon
as
possible.
one
order
on
that
is
in
the
record
on
page
97,
and
there's
another
order
on
page
225
of
the
record
that's
brought
up
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
saying
that
they
were
never
legal
trustees.
they
certainly
weren't
at
that
time,
and
only
over
our
objection
they
granted
them
the
power
to
stay
in
office
until
the
election
can
be
held.
well,
the
chancellor,
like
they
say,
ordered
the
matter
sent
to
the
justice
department,
the
u.s.
attorney
general,
for
his
approval
or
disapproval.
that
was
done
on
july
the
24th,
1979.
he
did
not
make
any
ruling
within
60
days
one
way
or
the
other.
the
chancellor
could
have
gone
ahead
and
called
the
election,
but
he
simply
wouldn't
do
it,
and
it
was
march
28th,
1980,
before
the
attorney
general
ever
made
any
ruling.
and
his
only
objection,
by
the
way,
is
not
to
keep
down
the
election;
his
only
objection
was
that
the
plurality
theory
ought
to
win
as
compared
to
the
runoff
election.
well,
so
we
go
back
into
court
and
file
a
petition
with
the
chancellor
saying,
all
right,
we
don't
care
whether
they
have
a
plurality
election
or
whether
they
have
a
runoff
election.
that's
in
the
record
there
on
page
249
of
the
record
brought
up
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
and
i
believe
that
petition
is
printed
in
the
appendix,
too.
and
the
petition
says
that
it's
immaterial
to
us,
because
our
interest
is
the
interest
in
the
schools
and
the
children,
who
are
going
to
teach
our
children,
who
are
going
to
be
trustees
of
our
schools;
and
that
we
also
prayed
that
if
the
court
found
it
necessary
to
join
the
attorney
general
in
as
a
party.
and
he
refused
to
do
that.
but
we
agreed
in
writing
and
filed
it,
we'd
go
along
with
the
attorney
general's
ruling
on
the
plurality
on
may
15,
1980,
when
we
filed
that
petition.
well,
the
chancellor
said,
i'm
not
going
to
let
him
have
the
election
yet.
see,
it
had
been
since
1960,
been
that
way;
still
no
election.
and
now
it's
gone
on
up
to
may
15,
1980.
the
attorney
general's
already
ruled.
the
chancellor
says,
still
can't
get
any
election,
because
the
attorney
general
said
a
plurality
man
has
to
win,
the
one
that
gets
the
most
votes
at
the
first
election
when
the
first
election's
held.
and
the
state
law
says
on
school
districts,
municipal
school
districts,
requires
a
runoff.
so
due
to
that
conflict,
i
can't
grant
your
petition
to
go
along
with
the
attorney
general
and
have
the
election.
so
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
again
with
them,
and
so
when
we
got
back
up
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
they
required
them
to
hold
the
election
and
ordered
the
first
order
enforced.
and
we
did
finally
have
the
election.
they
tried
to...
and
then
the
justice
department
did
come
in
and
file
some
papers
up
there
at
aberdeen.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes,
sir.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
no,
sir.
i'll
tell
you
how
that
came
about.
thank
you
for
raising
the
question.
i
was
going
to
call
your
attention
to
it.
of
course,
they
claim
in
their
opinion
that,
first
of
all,
the
case
law
had
already
been
decided
and
therefore
that
issue
could
not
come
before
the
court.
but
this
sentence
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
which
you
all
have
up
here,
if
i
understand
correctly.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
that's
the
last
opinion,
yes.
"on
oral
argument
both
parties
agreed
to
abide
by
the
statutory
scheme
requiring
a
runoff
election.
"
in
other
words,
nobody
has
questioned
that
in
this
court,
no
one
has
raised
that
issue.
the
justice
department
hasn't
even
raised
that
issue.
mr.
mayo
has
not
raised
that
issue.
nobody
had
raised
the
issue
about
whether
or
not
both
parties
or
everybody
that
was
involved
in
the
case
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
runoff
election.
they're
bound
by
it.
that
question
can't
even
be
ruled
on
by
this
court
because
nobody
raised
the
question.
nobody's
raised
the
point.
does
that
answer
your
question?
that's
the
way
they
disposed
of
it.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
i
told
him
it
didn't
make
us
any
difference,
judge.
see,
we
had
a
petition
on
file,
like
i
say,
saying
that
we
don't
care
whether
it's
a
plurality
or
a
runoff.
all
we
want
is
an
election.
we've
been
deprived
of
it
since
1960.
so
that's
the
way
the
mississippi
supreme
court
disposed
of
that
issue,
though,
saying
that
mr.
mayo
agreed
right
there
in
open
court
that
there
would
be
a
runoff
and
that
i
agreed
for
the
other
side
there
would
be
a
runoff.
nobody
disputes
that
fact.
but
also,
there
was
another
reason
that
they
ruled
maybe
in
that
manner,
because
of
the
law
of
the
case
theory,
which
i'm
going
to
get
down
to
argue
if
i
have
time
to
in
just
a
few
moments
here.
now,
about
them
knowing
about
and
should
have
been
ready
about
the
voting
rights
act
issue.
their
first
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
appears
in
the
record
on
page...
on
several
pages,
especially
in
the
record
on
page
29.
they
first
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
supreme
court
and
that
was
the
first
time
they
raised
the
issue
about
the
voting
rights
act,
the
one-man,
one-vote
theory.
then
they
argued
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
was
denied
by
this
honorable
court,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
petition...
this
issue's
already
been
ruled
on
by
this
court.
they
argued
in
their
petition
for
certiorari--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--thank
you.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
submit
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
a
party
to
this
case.
he
only
got
in
it
in
the
form
of
amicus
curiae.
actually,
he
got
here
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court...
now,
he
didn't
appear
in
the
lower
court
and
according
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
opinion
everybody
agreed
to
the
manner
of
holding
the
election.
he
says
in
his
own
brief
that
his
remedy
is
to
file
the
lawsuit
in
the
district
court,
have
a
three-judge
federal
panel
is
what
it
amounts
to,
and
that's
on
file
and
active
at
aberdeen,
mississippi,
in
the
federal
court.
and
we're
not
trying
to
avert
the
civil
rights
act
or
the
voting
rights
act
or
anything
of
that
nature
here.
these
people
have
waited
all
these
years
to
get
an
election
and
just
now
have
accomplished
that
purpose,
and
i
surely
would
say
that
the
court
should
let
them
stay
in
in
the
event
of
a
reversal,
because
the
other
group
stayed
in
much
longer
without
any
legal
authority
at
all.
at
least
these
people
were
elected
by
the
voters.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
judge,
there's
no
record
reference.
you
see,
in
the
mississippi--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--well,
no,
sir.
this
is
just
the
opinion
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
because
it
was
brought
out
in
oral
argument
before
the
court,
just
like
right
now.
they
asked
the
questions
to
us.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
they
asked
me
if
it
made
me
any
difference
whether
the
election
was
by
plurality
or
by
runoff,
and
we
told
them
no.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes,
sir.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
no,
sir.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
it
was
while
the
argument--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--it
was
all
right
with
them
to
have
it
either
way.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes,
and
that's
the
reason
the
supreme
court
put
it
in
here.
they
said:
"on
oral
argument
both
parties
agreed
to
abide
by
the
statutory
scheme
requiring
a
runoff
election.
"
well,
i
told
them
it
didn't
make
me
any
difference
in
effect.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
no,
sir.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
well,
to
show
that
there's
no
issue
between
the
parties
that's
now
before
this
court
as
compared
to
a
plurality
vote
or
a
runoff
election.
the
parties
that
were
involved
in
the
lawsuit
in
the
lower
court,
there's
no
issue
between
them
and
can't
be
an
issue
because
they
all
agreed
to
it.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
well,
that's
a
good
question.
they
don't
state
any
jurisdictional
grounds
whatsoever
in
the
petition.
and
we
raised
that.
they
just
merely
say
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
ruled
against
them--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--we
objected
to
the
jurisdiction,
and
when
they
went
to
write
down
jurisdiction
they
merely
say
one,
two
sentences:
"the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
was
entered
on
june
3,
1981,
and
rehearing
denied
on
july
8,
1981.
"
"the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
august
28,
1981,
and
was
granted
on
december
14,
1981.
"
that's
all
the
jurisdictional
things
they
allege
in
their
brief.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
well,
certainly
they
are,
judge.
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
well,
i
was
going
to
get
down
to
that,
judge,
right
shortly.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
you
see,
the
first
petition
that
came
here
to
this
court,
they
argued
the
voting
rights
statute,
you
see,
and
it
was
plainly
and
clearly
printed
in
there.
and
i
filed
an
opposition
paper
to
that
petition
for
rehearing.
that's
in
the
court
record.
a
copy
of
both
is
in
there.
and
when
it
got
back
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
they
cited
where
you
all
denied
certiorari
on
441
u.s.
946,
but
they
say
it's
not
your
decision
that
makes
the
law
of
the
case;
it
says
it's
our
prior
decision
that
makes
the
law
of
the
case.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes.
and
there's
law
to
support
that
proposition
in
numerous
places,
but
i
would
like
to
just
say
briefly,
it
was
the
same
people,
it
was
the
same
law,
the
same
issues
that
went
up
both
times,
you
see.
and
since
the
law
of
the
case
has
been
established,
then
they
couldn't
go
back
into
this
federal
question
of
civil
rights.
the
only
way
the
attorney
general
can
do
that
is
to
go
forward
with
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
at
aberdeen,
like
he
says.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
right,
and
at
the
time
of
the
second
hearing--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--and
if
you
don't
you
waive
it.
another
case,
rio
grande
railway
versus
stringham,
said
that
since
the
first
judgment
settled
the
issue
and
disposed
of
the
whole
case
on
the
merits
and
directed
what
judgment
should
be
entered,
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
lower
court
to
do,
and
then
that
the
question
sought
to
be
presented...
that
there
was
no
need
to
grant
certiorari
relief,
because
the
first
case...
the
first
case
decided
the
law
of
the
case.
i
have
with
me
a
mississippi
supreme
court
decision
of
mississippi
college
versus
may
holding
that
on
the
doctrine
of
law
of
the
case
whatever
is
once
established
as
controlling
legal
rule
of
decision
between
same
parties
in
the
same
case
the
court
should
not
rehear.
now,
a
very
interesting
case
that
this
court
ruled
on,
webb
versus
webb,
101
supreme
court
1889,
in
1891...
page
1891.
that
was
a
case
with
a
child
custody
decree
in
florida
giving
the
mother
custody,
one
in
georgia
giving
the
father
legal
custody.
so
the
u.s.
supreme
court
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
because
full
faith
and
credit
hadn't
been
given
to
the
florida
decree,
which
was
obtained
first.
when
it
got
up
here,
though,
you
said,
after
looking
at
the
record
and
seeing
that
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
lower
state
court,
then
you
cannot
pass
on
it,
that
you
have
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
in
mississippi,
yes,
sir.
i
have
a
citation
in
the
brief
there,
i
believe--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--yes,
i
got
the
whole
case.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
sir?
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
well,
this
particular
case
was
in
1961--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--in
the
appendix?
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
what
page,
justice
marshall?
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
page
11.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
well,
that
was
the
mississippi
supreme
court--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--that
wrote
that.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
no,
sir.
justice
marshall,
i'm
getting
my
basis
first
of
all
from
their
last
opinion.
it's
not
printed
in
your
appendix
there,
and
it
says
our--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--sir?
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes,
sir.
that's
what
it
says,
that
under
the
circumstances
they
have
no
right
to
alter
in
any
respects
something
that
has
already
been
ruled
on.
a
real
quick
one
here
would
be
the
case,
the
cardinal
case
from
louisiana
says
that
the
supreme
court
will
not
decide
federal
constitutional
issues
raised
before
it
for
the
first
time
on
review
of
state
court
actions.
there
is
another
case
that's
real
short
here
i
had
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
i
believe
it's
called
the
bloeth
case.
i
don't
see
it
right...
i
don't
see
it
right
handy
here,
but
that
was
a
case
where
the
bill
of
penalty
had
been
ordered
and
so
the
u.s.
supreme
court
ruled
that
even
so,
since
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court,
it
couldn't
be
raised
here.
herndon
versus
georgia
is
another
case
holding...
see,
the
question
of
how
to
appeal
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court
becomes
significant
here,
because
on
appeal
it
said,
we
found
it
unnecessary
to
review
the
points
made
since
this
court
is
without
jurisdiction
for
the
reason
that
no
federal
question
was
seasonably
raised
in
the
court
below
or
passed
upon
by
that
court.
none
was
in
this
last
decision.
that
had
already
been
decided
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
and
on
you
all's
refusal
to
grant
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
issue
was
raised
before
this
court--
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
--it
perhaps
was.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes.
i
didn't
write
the
opinion.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
the
law
of
the
case
is
what
disposes
of
this
case,
plus
another
factor:
the
attorney
general
can't
overturned
a
supreme
court
decision.
if
he
has
anything
to
say
about
it,
his
way
to
say
it
is
to
file
suit
in
a
federal
court
and
get
a
three-judge
panel,
and
that's
what
he's
done.
he
admits
that
in
his
brief.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
yes,
sir,
and
because
it
was
disposed
of
in
the
first
decision.
mr.
laurel
g.
weir
and
this
very
court
heard
it
and
it
was
certainly
raised
in
the
petition
that
was
filed
up
here,
and
i
filed
an
answer
to
it
in
opposition
to
it,
and
this
court
refused
to
grant
the
writ
of
certiorari.
and
these
questions
were
clearly
raised.
you
know,
there's
some
interesting
things
in
this
particular
statute.
it
reads,
"if
any
government
agent
desires
to
have
an
election
district
changed.
"
or
something.
it
doesn't
say
what
if
a
citizen
calls
on
the
city
or
the
government
and
claims
they're
not
obeying
the
federal
law.
that's
interesting.
also
it's
interesting,
in
the
government's
brief
the
fact
that
he
alleges
on
page
18
there
in
his
footnote...
that
was
very
interesting...
that
the
latest
federal
regulations
do
not
say
whether
or
not
a
decision
of
a
supreme
court
of
a
state
of
the
united
states
can
or
cannot
be
binding
in
reference
to
the
voting
rights
act.
we
hadn't
briefed
that
point
ourselves,
but
i
do
point
out
that
this
is
pointed
out
by
the
justice
department
here.
so
first
of
all,
the
law
of
the
case
was
established
at
the
time
the
case
was
first
before
the
mississippi
supreme
court
and
so
on.
and
i
enjoyed
being
with
you
gentlemen
and
mrs.
o'connor.
