mr.
james
c.
mayo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
section
5
voting
rights
act
case
up
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
the
issue
that
is
before
this
court
is
can
the
mississippi
supreme
court
order
noncompliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
a
submission
was
made...
and
i
would
add,
voluntarily
made...
on
the
basis
that
we
did
it
on
an
issue
that
we
raised
before
the
chancery
court
of
winston
county
and
made
a
submission
to
the
justice
department
under
section
5
of
the
act
for
preclearance
on
changes
in
the
method
and
manner
of
the
election
of
the
trustees
of
the
louisville
municipal
separate
school
district.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
we
were
placed
under...
we
have
received
this
letter
from
the
justice
department
telling
us
that
the
changes
were
legally
unenforceable.
but
the
decree,
the
final
decree
of
the
lower
court,
ordered
the
election
to
remain
in
force
subject
to
compliance
with
the
act,
and
the
decision
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
52758
advised
us
and
ordered
us
and
mandated
us
to
ignore
the
lower
court,
which
required
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
i
think
our
relief
under
the
voting
rights
act
as
i
understand
it
is
we
either
obtain
approval
or
resubmit
to
justice
or
we
go
into
the
district
court
of
columbia,
is
the
way
i
interpret
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
not
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
we
had
made
the
submission
to
the
justice
department
and
they
had
turned
us
down
and
said
the
changes
in
the
election
procedure
were
legally
unenforceable.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
once
again,
under
section
5
there
is
a
three-judge
relief
that
is
afforded.
but
i
really
feel
like,
since
we
had
made
the
submission,
that
we
were
limited
to
two
avenues
which
i
have
previously
stated,
either
justice
or
the
d.c.
court
in
columbia.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
yes,
sir.
but
the
federal
case
was
not...
which
federal
case?
the
one
filed
by
the
justice
department?
the
one
filed
by
the
justice
department
was
not
filed
until
just
prior
to
this
election
last
december.
now,
the
original
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
but
because
of
the
existence
of
the
state
law
the
district
court
judge
sent
it
back
to
mississippi,
the
mississippi
courts,
for
a
definition
under
section
37-7-203.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
he
dismissed
the
case
ultimately,
not
immediately
but
ultimately.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
that's
true,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
the
federal
issue--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--at
that
time
in
the
district
court
they
filed
suit...
it
was
originally
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
under
the
one-person,
one-vote
rule,
which
was
never
reached.
it
was
never
addressed.
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
either.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
the
lower
chancery--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--well,
the
lower
chancery
court
said
that
the
avenues
that
were
open,
in
its
final
hearing
before
the
second
appeal
or
the
appeal
from
which
this
is,
that
we
either
had
to
go
into
the
d.c.
court,
we
had
to
go
to
justice,
or
the
respondents
had
to
take
an
appeal.
the
suit
was
filed
by
justice
in
december,
this
past
december,
after
the
mechanics
in
the
election
was
pretty
far
down
the
road.
just
prior
to
the
election
they
filed
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
refused
to
grant
an
injunction
stopping
the
election.
we
had
a
hearing
about
the
third
day
of
december
and
the
first
primary
was
on
december
5th.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
they
have
asked
for...
they
have
asked
for
an
injunction
and
they
contend
that
we
are
in
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
by
having
an
election
in
the
face
that
we
have
been
denied
preclearance.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
that
may
be
true.
but
they
have
disapproved
the
scheme
that
we
were
mandated
to
do--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
i
think
sooner
or
later
either
the
district
court
or
the
d.c.
court
or
some
court
will
have
to
ultimately
solve
the
problem,
and
we
will
more
than
likely
go
into--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
is
because
i
just
do
not
feel
like
that
the
results
that
were
ordered
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court...
first
of
all,
it's
in
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
my
opinion;
and
secondly,
it
does
not...
the
results
of
the
election
speak
for
itself.
historically
in
the
city
of
louisville
and
in
winston
county
we
have
never
elected
a
black
person.
on
the
old
board
we
had
one
black
trustee.
mrs.
veterine
williams,
who
is
a
petitioner
in
this
cause,
is
a
black
trustee.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
as
far
as
the
act
itself,
i
believe
the
only
remedial
provision
of
that
statute
is
the
three-judge
panel.
i
think
perhaps
they've
even
stripped
the
district
court
from
that
remedial...
i
believe
it
specifically
says--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--a
three-judge
panel.
i
do
not
believe
a
state
court
could
usurp
the
authority
vested
in
the
three-judge
panel
by
the
statute.
but
i
think
that
the
state
courts
are
subject
to
the
federal
law
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
and
if
an
issue
comes
up
on
the
voting
rights
act,
i
think
all
of
the
decisions
that
i
read
and
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
put
the
burden
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
to
comply
with
the
act
and
to
seek
the
approval.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
at
the
temporary
hearing,
they
asked
to
eliminate
the
runoff
procedure.
that
was
the
sole
issue
that
was
before
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi,
was
just
eliminate
the
runoff
provision.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
they
did
not
challenge
the
boundary
lines
for
the
five
single-member
districts.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
that
is
almost
correct.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
immediately
after
the
attorney
general's
objections
we
were
taken
back
into
chancery
court,
and
as
soon
as
judge
love
rendered
his
final
decree
calling
for
his
decree
of
election
to
remain
in
force
subject
to
the
compliance,
we
were
immediately
appealed
and
jurisdiction
removed
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
52-758.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
justice
o'connor,
that
is
37-7-217.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
that
issue...
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
and
the
lower
court
did
rule
in
favor
of
the
runoff,
the
majority...
i
mean,
the
runoff
vote
requirement.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
the
provision
of
mississippi
law
in
municipal
separate
school
districts
does...
they
are
related
and
they
do
require
a
runoff.
i
was
of
the
opinion
that
perhaps
justice
in
filing
a
suit
thought
that
they
might
solve
a
problem
and
enable
blacks
to
be
elected
in
a
plurality
type
vote.
i
personally
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think
that's
the
proper
way
to
elect--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--if
you
just
totally
ignore
it
and
it
were
stricken.
but
in
the
provision
for
the
election
of
trustees
in
the
municipal
separate
school
district
statutes,
37-7-203
and
37-7-217,
they
are
related,
unless
they
are
stricken
by
a
court.
there's
no
decision
that
i
know
of
that
separates
them.
0....
the
facts
in
this
case
are
really
not
in
dispute
in
the
record
as
the
record
speaks
at
all.
prior
to
1960
there
were
three...
in
1960
we
annexed
to
entire
county
and
the
city
wanted
to
maintain
control,
so
three
were
appointed
and
two
were
elected.
of
course,
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
in
1965.
in
1964,
just
prior
to
it,
the
legislature
passed
a
local
and
private
bill
which
said
in
any
xx
where
14
and
15
intersect,
which
is
winston
county.
xx
it
was
because
of
section
90(p)
of
the
mississippi
constitution
and
because
of
another
related
case
involving
some
of
the
same
language,
it
was
not
sought
to
be
put
into
effect
until
petitioners
filed
a
suit,
and
we
were
ultimately
mandated
to
do
so
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
in
anticipation,
we
submit
that
all
the
decisions
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief...
perkins
versus
matthews,
allen
versus
u.s.,
and
then
the
most
recent
one,
mcdaniel
versus
sanchez,
which
was
decided
june
the
1st,
which
we
incorporated
into
a
petition
for
rehearing...
require
us
to
make
the
submission,
and
we
made
that
submission.
and
counsel
opposite
in
his
brief
asked
for
the
relief
to
be
prospective
in
nature,
but
we
like
the
language
in
perkins
versus
matthews
that
with
a
good
faith
compliance
by
us
with
the
act
that
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
this
honorable
court
should
be
remedial
or
retrospective,
because
we
sought
before
this
court
a
stay,
both
prior
to
the
granting
of
certiorari
and
after
the
granting
of
certiorari,
and
before
the
elections
were
held
and
after
the
elections
were
held
and
the
trustees
adjudicated
into
office.
and
this
court
on
two
occasions
denied
that
stay.
so
one
of
the
reliefs
that
we
are
asking
is
that
the
prior
election
be
vacated,
the
trustees
removed
from
office.
and
i
realize
that
down
the
road
we
will
have
to
comply.
thank
you.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--i'd
like
to
correct
an
error
in
one
question
that
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
about
the
election.
there
was
a
runoff
in
four
of
the
five.
the
elections
were
december
the
5th
and
december
the
19th.
there
was
a
runoff
election
in
four.
in
district
number
two
there
was
an
exact
tie,
and
by
special
order
the
two
candidates
agreed
to
have
a
runoff
election
on
december
the
19th.
and
i
wanted
to
correct
that.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
i
would
say
that
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
is
not
applicable
to
section
5
and
section
5
compliance.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
no,
sir,
they
did
not
decide
it.
in
49-446,
the
first
opinion,
they
did
not
decide
the
section
5.
what
we
did
was
no
different
than
what
the
attorneys
did
in
mcdaniel
versus
sanchez.
when
we
were
ordered
to
do
something
different,
then
we
had
to
raise
section
5
or
at
least
call
it
to
the
court's
attention.
and
i
don't
believe
that
there's
a
competent
attorney
in
the
united
states
of
america
representing
a
covered
jurisdiction
that
would
advise
his
clients,
in
the
face
of
a
disapproval
from
the
justice
department
of
the
united
states
when
a
submission
had
been
made,
to
go
ahead
and
have
an
election,
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
plurality
or
a
runoff.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
the...
to
me
that
is
the
key
issue,
regardless
of
all
the
other
things
that
have
been
argued.
that
march
28th
letter
said
don't
have
the
election.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
well,
of
course
it
would
be
error
for
the
state
court
to
do
that.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
if
it
had
been
decided
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
even
though
it
was
an
error,
that
issue
would
have
been
before
the
court
in
49-446,
but
it
was
not.
mr.
james
c.
mayo
i
do
not
believe
so,
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
have
for
that--
mr.
james
c.
mayo
--i
like
the
language
of
judge
love
when
he
ordered
compliance
with
section
5.
he
said:
"the
purpose
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
to
protect
people
not
before
the
court.
"
and
that's
in
the
record
at
pages
90
and
91.
thank
you
very
much.
