unknown
speaker
mr.
mayo,
you
say
the
issue
is
whether
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
can
require
noncompliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
do
you
think
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
has
ordered
noncompliance
or
has
simply
refused
to
order
compliance?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
does
that
leave
you?
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
simply
said
that
the
chancellor
shouldn't
have
put
in
the
direction
that
the
election
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act.
do
you
think
that
after
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
you
are
no
longer
free
to
go
into
federal
court
and
urge
that
the
federal
voting
rights
act
govern?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
you
could
have
gone
into
a
federal
court
in
mississippi
just
for
a
declaration
that
the
voting
rights
act
did
cover
it
or
had
not
been
complied
with?
unknown
speaker
or
could
you
have
sought
an
injunction
in
mississippi
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
there
a
federal
case
filed?
unknown
speaker
and
he
dismissed
the
case?
unknown
speaker
he
just
sent
it
back
for
state
law
construction,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
federal
issue?
what
happened
to
it?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
issue
would
be
whether
the
voting
rights
act
was
being
complied
with.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
well,
didn't
the
mississippi
court
say
that
if...
didn't
it
recognize
that
you
could
still
go
to
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
be
in
contempt,
would
you,
if
you
filed
a
suit
in
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
results
of
the
election?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that...
what
if
the
government
prevails
in
that
suit?
unknown
speaker
by
doing
what
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
so...
but
if
they
prevail
you
will
be
forced
to
do
what
you
want
to
do
anyway?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
you
didn't...
you're
objecting
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
mandated
you
to
do.
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
the
united
states
prevails,
you
will
be
relieved
of
what
you
wanted
to
be
relieved
of
in
the
first
place.
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
asking
us
to.
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
state
is
going
to
implement
a
change
in
a
voting
procedure
that
has
not
been
cleared,
and
some
private
citizen
objects
to
that
implementation
without
clearance
and
files
a
suit
in
the
state
court
saying...
asking
the
court
to
enforce
the
voting
rights
act.
under
the
voting
rights
act
is
the
three-judge
court
relief
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
voting
rights
act?
unknown
speaker
right.
how
about
a
state
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mayo,
may
i
ask
you
what
relief
the
government
seeks
in
the
federal
case
that's
been
filed?
unknown
speaker
so
they
don't
challenge
the
boundary
lines
for
the
five
single-member
districts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mayo,
along
the
same
lines,
the
attorney
general
did
not
challenge
either
the
order
that
there
be
elected
a
school
board
member
from
each
of
the
five
districts,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
your
clients
are
the
incumbent
board
members.
unknown
speaker
and
they
didn't
want
to
have
this
new
procedure
implemented,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
so
when
the
attorney
general
came
in
and
filed
an
objection
your
clients
were
pleased,
because
they
didn't
want
to
implement
it
anyway,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
why
you
didn't
go
on
to
federal
court,
because
you
didn't
want
to
get
this
clarified
because
your
clients
were
content
to
just
have
the
attorney
general's
objection
stand,
right?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
the
statute
that
requires
the
majority
vote.
that
is
a
separate
statute,
is
it
not,
from
the
statute
that
requires
the
election
of
a
board
member
from
each
separate
district?
unknown
speaker
a
separate
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
presumably
the
two
are
severable,
and
if
the
provision
for
a
majority
vote
is
not
permitted
and
people
can
be
elected
by
a
plurality,
then
under
the
state
law
of
mississippi
would
the
separate
district
election
still
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
that
runoff
vote
requirement
were
stricken?
is
it
related
in
any
way
to
the
separate
district
vote
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
runoff
provision
severable
from
the
other
requirement,
the
separate
election?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
that's
basically
a
question
of
mississippi
law,
isn't
it,
the
extent
of
the
application
of
law
of
the
case
or
collateral
judicial
estoppel?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't
be
true
if
we
were
talking
about
res
judicata
in
many
states,
would
it,
where
the
rule
is
that
anything
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
is
barred?
and
as
to
stuff
that
might
have
been
litigated,
you
would
have
no
notice
that
the
judgment
affected
that,
because
the
judgment
by
definition
wouldn't
speak
of
it.
it
hadn't
been
litigated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
does
the
record
tell
us,
or
if
it
doesn't
can
you
tell
us,
what
happened
at
the
election?
were
there
five
people
elected
by
majority
vote?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
is
in
issue
in
the
federal
case,
just
that
one
district?
unknown
speaker
but
in
that
litigation,
is
it
not
fair
to
predict
that
it
will
not
affect
four
of
the
people
who
now
hold
office,
no
matter
what
happens
to
it?
unknown
speaker
would
that
mean
then
that
the
three
people
appointed
by
the
city
and
the
two
elected
from
outside
the
city
would
then
be
returned
to
office?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
there
just
be
a
new
election
free
of
the
specific
thing
the
attorney
general
objected
to?
why
would
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
old
system?
unknown
speaker
well,
another
way,
another
way.
what
should
a
district
court
do?
hasn't
there
been
a
decision
lately
indicating
that
perhaps
a
court
shouldn't
go
any
farther
in
correcting
a
plan
than
the
extent
to
which
the
attorney
general
objected?
you
just
objected
to
the
majority
vote,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
object
to
the
single
member
districts.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you...
why
would
you
set
aside
the
entire
system?
you
would
just
say,
a
new
election
without
a
majority
vote,
and
there
was
no
majority
vote
necessary
in
some
districts.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is.
unknown
speaker
you're
submitting
that
if
you
object
to
any
provision
in
a
new
statute
the
entire
statute
is
suspended?
unknown
speaker
that
has
not
been
decided.
you're
quite
right,
that
hasn't
been
decided.
i
know
that's
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
let
me
hold
you
a
minute.
tell
me
again,
what
is
the
status
of
the
federal
suit
in
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
still
have
that
case
available,
however
this
one
is
decided,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you're
asking
be
done
in
the
suit
presently
going
on
in
the
federal
district
court?
you're
asking
the
court
to
just
sever
the
majority
vote
provision?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
declined?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
request...
do
you
think
the
district
court's
reaction
to
the
request
was
consistent
with
upman?
unknown
speaker
shouldn't
it
have
let
the
action
go
ahead,
go
forward,
pursuant
to
the
request
without
the
majority
vote
requirement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weir,
can
i
interrupt
you
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
on
that
appeal,
can
you
refresh
me?
did
the
mississippi
supreme
court
pass
on
the
question
whether
the
chancellor
was
correct
in
saying
that
the
majority
vote
requirement
could
not
be
severed
from
the
election,
or
did
they
just
not
reach
that?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
latest
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
way
it
does.
but
you
in
the
trial
court
had
said
you
were
willing
to
abandon
the
runoff
election.
unknown
speaker
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
weir.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weir,
you've
referred
two
or
three
times
to
this
stipulation
as
to
how
the
election
would
be
held.
now,
did
you
give
us
a
record
reference
on
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
there
wasn't
a
record
of
all
the
proceedings
or
stipulations?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
is
it
supported
by
the
record
or
not?
how
did
they
know
that?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
ask?
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
they're
referring
to
a...
they're
referring
to
a
stipulation
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
thought
you
said
they
were
referring
to
a
stipulation
in
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
no.
oh.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
the
response
from
the
other
side?
unknown
speaker
that
was
their
response?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
suppose
that
the
two
parties
could
stipulate
their
way
out
of
the
voting
rights
act.
you
don't
suggest
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what
is
the
significance
of
the
stipulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be.
but
how
did
the
case
get
here,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
somebody,
whoever
brought
the
case
here,
isn't
satisfied
with
the
result
below,
including
not
being
satisfied,
with
ignoring
the
objection
to
the
runoff
election.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
then
that
the
petitioners
are
disavowing
their
stipulation
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
what
they're
saying
now
is,
they
could
say,
well,
whatever
we
stipulated
to
then,
the
two
parties
were
acting
contrary
to
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
case?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that
this
is
just
like...
under
the
state
procedural
rules,
the
federal
issue
had
already
been
disposed
of.
unknown
speaker
it's
like,
if
you
want
to
raise
a
federal
issue,
some
rule
that
says
if
you
want
to
raise
a
federal
issue
you
have
to
raise
it
in
the
trial
court
first.
unknown
speaker
suppose,
mr.
weir,
suppose
i
did...
and
i'm
sure
you
have
done...
a
thorough
research
job
in
the
mississippi
cases.
would
i
find
consistently
adhered
to
this
law
of
the
case
doctrine?
would
you
think
that's
a
well-established
doctrine
in
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
them
is
ruling
case
law.
you
got
that
in
citation?
unknown
speaker
ruling
case
law?
a
little
old,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
little
old,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
this
citation
i
see
is
ruling
case
law,
and
it's
in
198
mississippi
that
cites
it,
in
your
appendix.
unknown
speaker
yes.
it's
the
opinion,
the
first
opinion
of
the
court.
is
that
where
the
rule
of
the
law
comes
from?
unknown
speaker
page
11.
unknown
speaker
citing
from
the
first
opinion
that
you've
been
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
that's
where
you
get
this
basis?
unknown
speaker
does
it
rely
on--
unknown
speaker
--does
it
rely
on
ruling
case
law,
too?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
i
take
it
that
on
the
law
of
the
case
rationale
the
stipulation
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
most
recent
appearance
before
the
supreme
court
was
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
really
had
no
significance
if
the
law
of
the
case...
that's
an
independent
state
ground,
i
take
it,
you're
insisting
on.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
you
certainly
have
called
our
attention
to
the
stipulation
several
times,
which
really
isn't...
in
itself
is
not
dispositive.
you
have
to
get
to
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
a
question...
if
the
issue
were
here,
it
wouldn't
be
a
question
of
the
attorney
general
overturning
anything.
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
had
complied
with
the
federal
law.
but
you
say
the
issue
can't
even
be
brought
here
because
of
the
law
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
what
is
your
answer
to
law
of
the
case
position,
just
briefly?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
not
in
its
last
opinion
but
in
the
opinion
before
this,
that
it
decided
the
section
5
question?
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
felt
obligated
to
come
here.
unknown
speaker
suppose
whatever
section
5
issue
is
presented
here
had
been
presented
in
the
earlier
appeal.
suppose
it
had
and
it
had
been
decided
adversely
to
you.
petition
for
certiorari
denied,
and
suppose
there
is
a
law
of
the
case
doctrine
in
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
could
the
state
legitimately
refuse...
could
the
state
supreme
court
legitimately
refuse
to
address
the
question
again
in
this
latest
appeal?
unknown
speaker
it
said
it
did.
