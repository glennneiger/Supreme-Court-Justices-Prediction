mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
review
that
court's
judgment
ordering
the
election
of
trustees
to
the
louisville
school
district
to
proceed
under
changed
election
procedures
without
first
obtaining
preclearance
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
notwithstanding
an
objection
to
the
changed
procedures
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
the
mississippi
court
erred
in
mandating
implementation
of
the
voting
change
in
the
absence
of
section
5
preclearance.
before
addressing
that
question,
which
we
believe
requires
an
affirmative
response,
respondents
have
raised
the
threshold
question
whether
this
court
can
properly
reach
the
section
5
inquiry
in
light
of
the
procedural
history
of
this
case.
very
briefly,
that
procedural
history
is
that
the
louisville
school
district
since
1960
has
embraced
the
whole
of
winston
county,
mississippi.
the
school
board
in
1960
consisted
of
five
trustees,
three
of
whom
were
appointed
by
city
officials
of
louisville
and
two
of
whom
were
elected
at
large
by
qualified
electors
outside
of
louisville.
in
1964
the
mississippi
legislature
enacted
legislation
applicable
to
the
louisville
school
district
requiring
each
of
the
trustees
to
be
elected
from
a
different
one
of
five
supervisory
districts.
believing
this
legislation
to
be
a
special
law
which
is
prohibited
by
the
mississippi
constitution,
the
city
officials
of
louisville
did
not
implement
that
change
in
1964,
or
indeed
thereafter.
and
in
1975
the
respondents
commenced
this
action
in
chancery
court
of
winston
county
seeking
enforcement
of
the
'64
statute.
the
chancery
court
ruled
that
the
statute
was
indeed
a
special
law
which
violated
the
mississippi
constitution
and
declined
to
enforce
it.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court
and
that
court
reversed,
concluding
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
'64
statute
could
be
saved
without
doing
violence
to
legislative
intent
by
removing
by
court
order
the
phrase
limiting
the
act's
applicability
only
to
the
louisville
district.
the
case
was
then
remanded
to
the
chancery
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
that
opinion.
petitioners
sought
rehearing
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court
and
raised
for
the
first
time
on
rehearing
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
the
'64
statute
as
modified
by
the
supreme
court's
decision.
that
rehearing
was
denied
without
any
mention
whatsoever
of
the
section
5
issue,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
on
remand
the
chancery
section
ordered
an
election
to
be
held
pursuant
to
the
'64
statute,
set
forth
procedures
to
govern
that
election,
and
then
entertained
the
section
5
question
and
ruled
specifically
that
the
election
of
all
five
trustees
from
supervisor
districts
was
an
election
change
requiring
preclearance
under
section
5,
and
then
ordered
that
that
change
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
for
section
5
review.
it
was
submitted.
the
attorney
general
objected
to
the
majority
vote
requirement
in
the
new
election
procedures.
following
that,
the
chancery
court
denied
a
motion
to
eliminate
or
sever
the
majority
vote
requirement
and
simply
to
allow
standing
the
mississippi
statute
relating
to
election
of
five
trustees.
it
said
it
would
not...
it
could
not
sever
that
because
the
statutory
framework
in
mississippi
required
that
that
particular
requirement
did
indeed
apply
to
the
louisville
school
district.
and
since
that
couldn't
be
severed,
the
chancery
court
reiterated
that
the
election
under
the
'64
statute
was
subject
to
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
that
prompted
respondent's
second
appeal
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
and
on
that
second
appeal
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
relying
on
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine,
reversed
as
to
the
part
of
the
decree
that
required
compliance
with
section
5.
now,
respondents'
claim
is
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
first
decision
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
on
rehearing
was
a
final
judgment
on
the
federal
question
as
to
section
5
applicability
at
the
time
that
it
was
rendered
and
it
came
to
this
court
on
certiorari,
and
thus
the
argument
is
made
that
because
that
was
a
final
judgment
at
that
time
and
certiorari
had
been
denied,
that
this
court
is
precluded
now
to
take
up
the
federal
question
on
the
applicability
of
section
5.
there
is,
however,
in
response
to
that,
there's
nothing
at
all
in
that
first
mississippi
decision
to
suggest
that
it
embraced
a
final
disposition
of
the
section
5
issue.
indeed,
that
first
decision
did
not
even
speak
to
the
section
5
issue,
and
that...
the
contention
that
it
did
dispose
of
the
federal
question
comes
up,
if
at
all,
only
with
respect
to
the
much
later
reference
the
second
time
around
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
law
of
the
case.
our
view
is
that
until
that
second
decision,
neither
the
parties,
nor
indeed
the
chancery
court
which
on
remand
reviewed
the
federal
question,
or
indeed
this
court
were
alerted
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
post
for
characterization
of
its
first
ruling.
indeed,
that
first
ruling
by
its
terms
was
certainly
susceptible
to
the
understand
by
everybody
that
it
was
a
non-final
decision
as
to
section
5,
it
didn't
speak
to
it,
and
that
the
section
5
question
was
one
that
was
available
to
the
parties
to
litigate
in
chancery
court
on
remand,
which
indeed
they
did.
surely
if
the
first
decision
is
one
that
does
not
by
its
terms
give
anybody
an
indication
of
finality,
the
parties
cannot
be
barred
from
supreme
court
review
of
the
federal
question,
nor
can
this
court
be
estopped
from
ruling
on
that
issue
in
the
absence
of
notice
that
it
was
indeed
a
final
judgment
at
the
time
that
it
came
here
the
first
time.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
the
mississippi
law
as
i
understand
it
on
law
of
the
case
is
that
it
applies
where
you
have
a
legal...
a
disposition
of
a
legal
issue
that
was
finally
determined.
and
what
i
think...
i
think
you're
right
that
it
is
an
application
of
mississippi
law.
but
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
first
mississippi
opinion
at
the
time
that
it's
rendered,
decision
at
the
time
it's
rendered,
to
give
an
indication
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
federal
question
issue
at
that
time,
we
think
that
this
court
is
not
precluded
nor
are
the
litigants
precluded
from
re-addressing
that
or
addressing
that
issue
when
it
comes
up
now
on
this
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think,
though,
that
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
you
had
a
final
judgment
at
that
time
that
would
bar
reaching
the
federal
question
at
this
time,
that
it's
different
than
the
res
judicata
situation.
and
our
view
is
that
the
issue
on
the
merits
is
properly
here
and
that
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
a
proper
grant.
on
the
merits,
the
decision
of
the
mississippi
court
i
think
did
mandate
that
this
election
go
into
effect
prior
to
any
preclearance.
and
in
doing
so,
that
was
error
if
the
change,
the
voting
change
in
question,
was
a
covered
change
under
the
voting
rights
act.
we
have
briefed
the
question
as
to
whether
it
was
a
covered
change.
we
think
it's
undisputed,
first,
that
there
was
an
election
here
that
was
involved.
second,
this
election
change,
even
though
it
occurred
by
legislation
prior
to
'64,
did
not
go
into
effect
until
after
november
of
'64,
and
this
court's
decision
in
perkins
v.
matthews,
justice
brennan's
decision,
makes
it
clear
that
a
change
which
goes
into
effect
after
'64
is
one
that
is
a
covered
change
notwithstanding
that
it's
pursuant
to
legislation
that
was
passed
prior
to
'64.
and
then
the
only
other
question
that
really
relates
to
whether
it's
a
covered
change
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
court-ordered
change
as
opposed
to
a
legislative
change.
i
think
that
on
that,
first,
it's
clearly
legislative.
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
when
it
held
the
statute
constitutional,
did
so
with
some
modification
or
redrafting
of
that
statute,
but
did
that
after
it
determined
that
its
change
was
fully
consistent
with
the
legislative
intent.
but
beyond
that,
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
court-ordered
change
by
a
state
court
would
be
immune
from
preclearance.
the
most
that
we
have
heard
is
in
the
east
carroll
parish
case
that
there
are
some
court-ordered
changes
pursuant
to
the
federal
court
reapportionment
plans
that
might
be
immune
from
section
5
preclearance.
but
as
to
state
court
changes,
it's
never
been
held
that
that
doctrine
would
apply,
and
so
even
if
this
were
by
some
stretch
to
be
considered
a
state
court's...
i
mean,
a
court-ordered
change,
it
would
not
be
immune
from
section
5
review.
we
think
that,
given
the
fact
that
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
covered
change
is
one
that
has
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
coverage,
that's
the
extent
of
the
inquiry
by
the
mississippi
court,
and
if
you
rule
that
it
is
a
covered
change
the
mississippi
court
was
in
error
to
order
the
election
to
go
into
effect
prior
to
preclearance.
and
we
do
think
that's
the
effect
of
the
order
and
it
has
to
be
reversed.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
were...
well,
there
was
one
runoff.
there
were
four...
four
people
were
elected
without
runoff
and
in
one
district
there
was
a
runoff
and
there
was
an
election
by
majority
vote.
so
that
the
majority
vote
requirement
did
take
effect
in
the
past
election
as
to
one
of
the
five
districts.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
the
federal
case
relates
to
the
voting
change,
not
to
the
past
election.
and
the
attorney
general
objected
to
the
majority
runoff
requirement.
in
fact,
he
objected
before
the
election
to
the
majority
runoff
requirement.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
necessarily
the
case,
because
all
the
people
that
are
elected
now
are
being
elected
from
supervisor
districts,
which
is
different
from
the
prior
arrangement
where
you
had
three
appointed
and
two
elected,
but
not
elected
by
any
defined
supervisor
district.
so
if
you
were
to
set
aside
the
election
because
it
had
not
been
precleared,
it
would
affect
all
five
of
them.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
if
one
were
to
set
aside
the
election
that
would,
unless
there
were
some
other
accommodation,
that
that
would
probably
be
the
result.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
would
be
another
way
that
it
could
be
done.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
the
decision
i
think
you're
referring
to
is
upman.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
the
question
really
is
whether
the
objection
by
the
attorney
general
as
to
a
submitted
plan,
if
it
identifies
that
portion
that
is
objectionable,
whether
that
would
permit
preclearance
of
the
rest
of
the
plan.
i'm
not
sure...
i
don't
believe
that
the
upman
case
really
decided
that
issue.
the
manner
that
the
law
now
is
is
that
an
objection--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--that's
right,
if
the
entire
statute
is
objectionable.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
no,
i
don't
think
that
has.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it's
actually
been
held
in
abeyance.
the
government
went
in
for
a
tro.
the
court
denied
a
tro,
and
that
case
is
now
pending
until
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct,
that
is
still
an
available
forum
to
go
in
and
to
continue
the
question
of
setting
aside
the
election
or...
in
that
case
we
ask
that
there
be
a
severability
of
the
majority
vote
requirement,
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
way
the
court
could
reach
the
result.
but
i
do
think
that
the
objection
as
such
would
go
to
the
whole
plan
as
submitted,
rather
than
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--we
asked
in
the
federal
district
court
that
the
court
simply
restrain
the
majority
vote
requirement,
enter
a
tro
as
to
the
majority
vote
requirement,
and
allow
the
election
to
proceed,
but
not
with
that
requirement.
and
the
court
responded
that
it
did
not
feel
it
had
the
authority
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
judicial
legislation
of
the
plan
that
was
submitted
and
so
it
declined
to
do
it
on
a
tro.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
district
court,
and
said
at
the
same
time
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
showing
of
irreparable
injury
to
stop
the
election.
but
the
request
was
to
ask
them
simply
to
stop
that
portion
going
into
effect
that
related
to
the
majority
vote.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
was
consistent
with
upman?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don't
believe
upman
really
reached
that
question
squarely.
i
think
that
one
could
argue
from
upman
that
the
district
court
might
have
taken
that
step,
but
i
don't
think
upman
really
reached
that
issue.
as
i
understand
upman,
upman
said
that
when
the
court
is
redrafting
its
own
reapportionment
plan
and
it
has
in
front
of
it
an
objection
from
the
attorney
general
that
it
should...
that
only
objects
to
certain
features,
deference
should
be
paid
to
the
legislative
judgment
that
is
made
as
to
the
rest
of
the
plan.
and
therefore,
in
its
reapportionment
activity
it
should
not
undertake
to
redo
or
redraw
those
features
that
are
not
subject
to
the
objection.
and
i
don't
think
it
really
reaches
the
precise
question
that
you're
asking.
