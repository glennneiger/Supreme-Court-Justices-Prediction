mr.
allan
r.
browne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
allen
browne,
kansas
city.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
supplement
the
statement
of
facts
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners
very
briefly.
there
was
--
the
way
it
was
put
to
you,
not
a
long
history
of
a
disabling
heart
trouble,
disabling.
owens
had
had
heart
murmurs
all
of
his
life.
a
congenital
matter,
he
said
his
parents
had
it
too
and
all
lived
to
a
nice
old
age.
but
he
did
have
this
murmur
in
his
heart.
he
had
high
blood
pressure
to
some
extent
but
the
crucial
point
that
caused
him
to
lay
off
was
because
he
was
tired
and
he
had
good
reason
to
be
tired.
he
worked
12
to
14
hours
a
day
with
an
associate
heaving
huge
sides
of
beef
weighing
450
pounds
perhaps
up
and
hanging
them
on
hooks
and
after
16
years
of
that
satisfactorily
performed,
he
became
rather
tired.
he
was
46
years
old
then.
and
so
he
had
sick
leave
and
the
like
and
he
decided
to
take
off.
he
went
to
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
did
not
blame
it
on
heart
trouble
but
blamed
it
on
his
being
too
fat
and
he
was
too
fat
and
he
took
off
50
pounds.
he
took
about
2
or
3
months
to
do
it
and
when
he
came
back
ready
to
go,
he
had
the
“okay”
of
his
doctor,
his
own
doctor
who
is
stated
by
the
other
side
or
by
the
company
to
be
a
recognized
doctor
and
then
he
got
other
statements
from
doctors
that
his
blood
pressure
and
everything
was
all
right,
he
was
able
to
work.
he
produced
a
total
of
six
doctors
and
this
of
course,
to
me,
is
more
of
a
jury
question
than
any
other
question
but
i
wouldn't
want
the
court
to
have
a
wrong
impression
about
that.
after
they
refused
to
let
him
go
back
to
work,
he
went
in
to
what
jobs
he
could
get
without
a
benefit
of
a
recommendation
from
his
former
employer
and
he
did
some
very
hard
work;
he
climbed
trees,
sawed
off
branches
and
did
whatnot
and
that
went
on
for
at
least
three
years,
i
think
before
the
case
was
tried.
the
case
was
tried
in
‘64
and
this
lay
off
if
i
remember
right,
occurred
in
'59.
so
there's
five
years
right
there
and
then
after
the
case,
and
he
got
a
work;
he
still
worked
along
and
he
did
finally
die
and
i
think
he
died
from
hypertension
which
i
suppose
could
happen
anytime
to
anybody
after
the
lapse
of
five
years
with
or
without
the
work.
now,
as
to
one
doctor
saying
he
was
not
suitable
to
go
back
to
work,
that
is
true.
in
fact,
two
doctors,
one,
the
country
doctor
and
the
other
doctor
that
he
went
to
on
recommendation
of
his
own
said
that.
but
six
doctors
said
that
he
was
able
to
go
to
work
and
this
again
to
me
is
strictly
a
jury
issue
if
unless
it
impinges
on
the
question
of
whether
he
had
a
meritorious
case.
now
that
had
some
slight
effect,
it
seems
to
me,
upon
the
question
--
the
cases
that
appear
here.
if
i
heard
correct
then
it
was
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
catch
the
question
that
was
asked,
someone
inquired
one
of
your
honors
about
whether
there
was
punitive
damages
sought,
there
was
and
punitive
damages
granted
and
i
blush
to
say
if
the
jury
did
give
more
than
we
asked
and
that
however
has
been
taken
cared
off
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
by
remedy.
the
$300.00,
i
thought
--
which
one
of
your
honors
inquired,
taking
our
testimony
at
its
best
as
the
jury
verdict
entitles
us
to
do,
i
think,
the
$300.00
was
not
taken
with
the
statement
that
it
was
a
poor
claim
but
he'd
take
the
$300
for
a
cost.
but
the
$300.00
using
an
inference
which
a
person
of
ordinary
reasonable
understanding
would
take
and
which
i
am
sure
the
jury
took
was
--
is
what
a
man
in
the
street
would
call
a
lug.
it
was
completely
without
authority;
it
was
outrageous
and
the
word
i
used
is
the
word
of
one
of
the
union
officials
when
asked
about
that.
it
was
improper
and
again
that
word
is
in
quotes
from
one
of
the
union
officials
when
asked
if
such
a
thing
could
be
done.
so
much
for
the
fact
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
suspect
and
by
inference
that
it
was
to
go
to
the
individual
because
the
officials
termed
it
improper,
you
see
and
therefore,
i
think,
the
jury
was
entitled
to
say
that
it
was
in
plain
language
a
“lug.”
mr.
allan
r.
browne
two.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
two
of
the
officials
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
in
the
record.
i'm
not
talking
out
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
in
the
record
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
to
me,
it
is.
and
i
haven't
gone
to
use
that
strong
language,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
to
me
it
is.
what
else
could
it
be
when
they
termed
it
outrageous
and
improper.
but
then
again,
this
goes
to
the
arbitrary
and
the
malicious
actions.
now
may
i
just
quickly
advert
to
what
the
whole
case
is
based
upon
in
our
view
which
is
upon
an
arbitrary
and
a
malicious
act
by
an
agent,
we
say
a
faceless
agent.
this
has
other
support
than
just
this
one
--
a
matter
and
we
have
outlined
a
number
of
those
in
our
brief
which
you
can
of
course
get
as
quickly
as
i
could
give
them
to
you
here
but
in
short,
one
of
them
is
that
this
very
person
who
asked
for
the
“lug”
had
a
freudian
slip
in
his
testimony
and
he
said
that
dismissing
the
grievance
clandestinely
one
month
before
the
case
was
tried,
if
you
please,
was
in
retaliation
for
bringing
the
suit,
then
later
he
corrected
himself.
but
there
again,
this
is
a
point
which
i
feel
that
this
court
has
a
right
to
take
but
its
common
sense
in
the
consideration
in
which
the
jury
did
take.
there
are
other
things
involved
in
the
question
of
arbitrariness
and
maliciousness
in
connection
with
faithless
representation
by
an
agent
of
his
principal
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
arbitrary
is
a
court
concept
in
the
gonzales
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
in
other
cases
and
this
is
the
basis
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
used
in
its
opinion
entirely
in
which
we'll
bring
in
just
a
moment
to
the
question
of
discrimination
then
known,
an
important
feature
in
this
case
as
i
see
it.
yes
sir,
the
action
in
the
--
began
in
the
missouri
case
is
based
upon
a
breach
of
a
contract
or
a
faithless
failure
by
an
agent
to
represent
his
principal.
the
contract,
being
the
duty,
it
is
true
is
set
out
by
the
bargaining
contract
but
of
course
there's
a
common
law
duty
in
addition
and
it
is
laid
under
our
view
as
an
internal
matter
involving
the
internal
operations
of
the
union,
the
petitioners.
it
is
laid
as
arbitrary
and
malicious
and
when
i
say
laid
down
meaning
the
petition,
of
course,
and
nowhere
in
the
petition,
in
the
evidence,
in
the
submission
by
instructions
to
the
jury
is
unfair
labor
practice
or
discrimination
mentioned
or
adverted
to.
this,
in
our
view,
is
a
simple
case
brought
under
the
common
law
duty
of
an
agent
faithfully
to
represent
and
the
agent,
its
true
became
the
agent
by
virtue
of
the
bargaining
contract
and
even
perhaps
by
the
statute
as
counsel
mentioned.
but
however,
he
became
the
agent,
his
duty
still
remains
governed
in
one
instance,
in
or
view,
by
state
law.
now
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
understand
your
question,
i
think.
no
sir,
of
course
not
because
this
would
put
an
impossible
burden
upon
everybody
concerned.
now
we've
nowhere
urged
that
but
the
touchstone,
your
honor,
is
as
i
see
it
is
arbitrary
or
malicious
actions,
then
they
must
respond.
but
only
then
and
that
is
the
touchstone
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
used
in
its
opinion.
it
confined
itself
solely
to
that.
it
discussed
other
features
of
course
and
incidentally,
now
the
question
is
raised
of
discretionary
power
of
the
union
which
has
some
nixes
with
your
question,
i
think,
and
as
to
discretionary
power,
the
union
does
have
discretionary
power;
it
must.
we
are
the
first
to
recognize
that.
but
to
what
limit
because
we
can
have
tyranny
in
union
officials
as
well
as
in
other
places
and
therefore,
the
law
must
have
some
control,
i
feel,
in
regulating
that
and
the
law
has
said
it
will
take
control
especially
in
the
gonzales
case
and
in
other
cases
since
that
time
by
regulating
arbitrary
and
malicious
actions.
these
are
our
points
in
this
particular
frame
of
factual
matter,
we
feel.
first,
if
i
--
i'm
not
putting
them
in
order
of
importance,
but
the
$300.00
averages
an
improper
request.
i
don't
and
probably
shouldn't
use
the
word
“lug”
because
it's
a
bare
knuckle
word
but
it
certainly
was
a
strange
thing.
they
didn't
deny
it
in
a
sense
because
in
their
evidence,
they
came
out
and
tried
to
turn
it
around
and
say
that
mr.
owens
had
requested,
had
said
he
would
give
$300.00
to
vaca
or
somebody
if
he
could
win
the
case
for
him,
like
on
a
contingent
basis.
you
see,
this
was
for
the
jury,
we
feel.
but
it
was
not
just
an
isolated
thing
that
mr.
owens
had
made
up
because
they
took
it
on
and
tried
to
turn
it
around
the
other
way.
now,
this
retaliation
business
is
significant
to
on
this
arbitrary
question,
if
you
please.
and
another
thing
is
the
clandestine
dismissal
one
month
before
this
case
was
tried,
if
you
please.
the
grievance
then
being
in
the
fourth
step,
there
were
five
altogether,
the
fifth
is
the
only
meaningful
one
in
a
really
contested
case
because
the
others
are
all
presented
to
the
employer.
the
meaningful
one
is
the
fifth
step
when
you
go
to
a
neutral
arbitrator
that
was
the
one
where
the
union
bought.
now
another
point
along
that
line,
if
i
may
continue
with
these
points
is
that
the
union
all
along
the
line
had
publicly
declared
that
this
claim
was
meritorious;
they
said
it
was
meritorious.
they
had
all
of
these
doctors'
statements,
six
to
two.
and
when
we
challenged
the
--
one
of
their
officials
at
the
trial
as
to
how
he
could
say
that
it
was
meritorious
at
one
time
and
then
at
another
time
no,
it's
not;
why
his
answer
was,
“well
we
might
the
twist
some
facts
a
little
bit
to
suit
the
occasion.”
to
me,
this
too,
adds
to
the
general
pile
of
arbitrary
actions
that
are
shown
by
the
evidence
here.
then
we
get
to
the
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
yes.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
we
had
an
action
gone
--
going
but
it
to
me
is
contingent
upon
the
decision
here.
i
think
it
may
be
inconsistent
with
this
and
it
has
been
held
in
advance
by
the
court
below.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
think
we'd
have
trouble
with
the
case
against
the
employer
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
please?
mr.
allan
r.
browne
well,
no
i
think
this
that
we
didn't
exhaust
our
remedies
to
the
employer
and
that
he
has
a
defense
there,
you
see.
that's
our
peak
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
we
didn't
exhaust
our
remedies
and
that's
what
this
suit
is
about
because
the
union
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
--
wouldn't
help
us
to
exhaust
the
remedy.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
he
would
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
he
has
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
he
has
said
it.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
but
we
haven't
exhausted
our
remedies
against
him
and
must
i
admit
that
he
may
have
some
merit
there.
and
so
that's
why
this
suit
is
brought
because
if
we
haven't
exhausted
our
remedies
we
can't
recover
against
the
employer
where
we
had
a
meritorious
claim
we
say.
and
now
here
we
are
flatfooted
there
and
therefore
the
people
who
put
us
in
that
position
are
the
petitioners
or
the
defendants
here,
that's
our
whole
case,
your
honor.
have
i
answered
that?
mr.
allan
r.
browne
the
breach
of
the
duty
without
any
collusion
between
the
employer
and
the
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
--
and
the
union
--
oh
i
think
so.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
well,
i
--
arbitrary
action
is
sufficient
and
coupled
with
malice,
there
--
the
legal
definition
of
malice
of
course
here,
i
think,
is
there
is
actual
malice.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
think
it
may
in
its
way
but
i
don'
think
it's
exclusive
and
here
i
get
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
some
degree
of
what?
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
know
they
govern
it.
the
federal
law
must
govern
as
should
the
law.
i'm
not
talking
about
forum.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
agree
entirely
and
wholeheartedly
the
federal
law
construing
what
the
duties
are
--
must
govern
and
you've
said
that
a
number
of
times
it
has
been
said
all
over.
so
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
feature.
the
question
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
similar,
yes,
your
honor.
lynn
is
one
of
the
case
upon
which
you
relied
and
--
but
i
would
with
your
permission
like
to
rephrase
that
just
slightly
and
say
not
that
i'm
asking
you
to
make
such
a
rule
but
i
think
there
is
such
a
rule
as
laid
out
by
gonzales
and
by
dowd.
dowd,
a
fairly
recent
case
in
which
my
distinguished
opponent
was
on
the
other
side
there,
and
which
this
court
said
that
there
were
state
forums
in
matters
that
had
federal
roots
shall
we
say
or
whatever
term
would
be
best
used,
and
in
addition,
a
number
of
other
cases.
i
like
the
dowd
case
which
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
and
i
like
the
gonzales
case,
when
i
say
i
like
i
mean
i
think
it
sets
out
these
principles
the
best.
the
gonzales
case
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
really
lays
it
out
in
very
clear
language
to
me
by
saying
that
certain
areas
are
not
taken
by
the
federal
forum.
they're
not
preempted.
the
federal
authority
can
operate
in
those
areas
and
the
dowd
case
made
that
very
clear
by
saying
that
these
are
things
the
state
still
are
on
board
with.
the
state
still
are
operating
very
well.
and
the
question
along
that
line
was
raised
that
there
be
conflict
between
the
federal
decisions
in
the
state.
you
still
control
that
and
i
think
it
was
in
the
dowd
case
that
you
said
that
this
is
the
appropriate
place
to
reconcile
any
such
differences
and
i
presume
that
that's
what's
happening
now
if
there
is
any
such
difference.
now,
not
only
the
lynn
case
but
there
are
several,
the
smith,
the
news
case.
the
maddox
case
written
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
the
russell
case
together
with
the
old
faithful
love
burnham
which
--
with
which
you're
all
very
familiar,
i'm
sure.
i
would
like
with
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left
to
discuss
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
have
said
that
court
jurisdiction
is
superior
to
board
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
a
climate.
this,
i'm
not
talking
about
state
courts
only
because
this
question
involves
federal
courts
of
course
as
well
as
state.
this
happens
to
be
from
the
state
jurisdiction
but
--
and
that
is
a
question
of
inadequacy
of
remedy.
a
board
is
limited,
we
know
that,
but
a
state
court
has
additional
powers.
this
is
highlighted
in
this
particular
case.
the
inadequacy
of
what
board
relief
would
have
been.
the
board
relief
can
hardly
be
a
deterrent
and
award
punitive
damages
such
as
can
be
awarded
in
a
court
case.
is
that
important?
it
seems
to
have
great
importance
because
we're
dealing
in
the
big
picture.
it
seems
to
me
with
the
question
of
deterrent
effect.
we're
dealing
with
the
possibility
of
you
might
say
despotic
--
oh,
that's
a
strong
word
or
tyrannical,
over
exercise
of
power.
this
is
an
--
synonym
perhaps
for
arbitrary
and
malicious
actions
certainly
for
arbitrary
actions
and
there
you
can
control
that
best
by
punitive
damages.
you
can
restore
a
man
to
his
job
but
if
he's
dead
or
if
the
worry
of
being
out
of
work
for
four
years
has
made
him
unfit
to
go
on
then
you
have
a
sterile
remedy.
so
a
board's
power
there
is
useless.
but
a
court,
while
it
is
not
omnipotent
in
its
powers
can
do
a
lot
more.
it
may
be
that
if
there
are
many
actions
like
this
in
the
air
now
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
if
there
are
or
not,
that
it
is
a
fine
thing
that
you
have
said
from
the
point
of
view
of
national
welfare
that
you
have
said
that
state
courts
or
federal
courts
shall
have
concurrent,
if
you
will,
jurisdiction
with
the
boards
that
that
is
a
fine
thing
because
it
will
serve
the
national
interest
and
it
will
serve
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
theories
of
industrial
peace.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
allen
browne,
kansas
city.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
supplement
the
statement
of
facts
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners
very
briefly.
there
was
--
the
way
it
was
put
to
you,
not
a
long
history
of
a
disabling
heart
trouble,
disabling.
owens
had
had
heart
murmurs
all
of
his
life.
a
congenital
matter,
he
said
his
parents
had
it
too
and
all
lived
to
a
nice
old
age.
but
he
did
have
this
murmur
in
his
heart.
he
had
high
blood
pressure
to
some
extent
but
the
crucial
point
that
caused
him
to
lay
off
was
because
he
was
tired
and
he
had
good
reason
to
be
tired.
he
worked
12
to
14
hours
a
day
with
an
associate
heaving
huge
sides
of
beef
weighing
450
pounds
perhaps
up
and
hanging
them
on
hooks
and
after
16
years
of
that
satisfactorily
performed,
he
became
rather
tired.
he
was
46
years
old
then.
and
so
he
had
sick
leave
and
the
like
and
he
decided
to
take
off.
he
went
to
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
did
not
blame
it
on
heart
trouble
but
blamed
it
on
his
being
too
fat
and
he
was
too
fat
and
he
took
off
50
pounds.
he
took
about
2
or
3
months
to
do
it
and
when
he
came
back
ready
to
go,
he
had
the
“okay”
of
his
doctor,
his
own
doctor
who
is
stated
by
the
other
side
or
by
the
company
to
be
a
recognized
doctor
and
then
he
got
other
statements
from
doctors
that
his
blood
pressure
and
everything
was
all
right,
he
was
able
to
work.
he
produced
a
total
of
six
doctors
and
this
of
course,
to
me,
is
more
of
a
jury
question
than
any
other
question
but
i
wouldn't
want
the
court
to
have
a
wrong
impression
about
that.
after
they
refused
to
let
him
go
back
to
work,
he
went
in
to
what
jobs
he
could
get
without
a
benefit
of
a
recommendation
from
his
former
employer
and
he
did
some
very
hard
work;
he
climbed
trees,
sawed
off
branches
and
did
whatnot
and
that
went
on
for
at
least
three
years,
i
think
before
the
case
was
tried.
the
case
was
tried
in
‘64
and
this
lay
off
if
i
remember
right,
occurred
in
'59.
so
there's
five
years
right
there
and
then
after
the
case,
and
he
got
a
work;
he
still
worked
along
and
he
did
finally
die
and
i
think
he
died
from
hypertension
which
i
suppose
could
happen
anytime
to
anybody
after
the
lapse
of
five
years
with
or
without
the
work.
now,
as
to
one
doctor
saying
he
was
not
suitable
to
go
back
to
work,
that
is
true.
in
fact,
two
doctors,
one,
the
country
doctor
and
the
other
doctor
that
he
went
to
on
recommendation
of
his
own
said
that.
but
six
doctors
said
that
he
was
able
to
go
to
work
and
this
again
to
me
is
strictly
a
jury
issue
if
unless
it
impinges
on
the
question
of
whether
he
had
a
meritorious
case.
now
that
had
some
slight
effect,
it
seems
to
me,
upon
the
question
--
the
cases
that
appear
here.
if
i
heard
correct
then
it
was
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
catch
the
question
that
was
asked,
someone
inquired
one
of
your
honors
about
whether
there
was
punitive
damages
sought,
there
was
and
punitive
damages
granted
and
i
blush
to
say
if
the
jury
did
give
more
than
we
asked
and
that
however
has
been
taken
cared
off
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
by
remedy.
the
$300.00,
i
thought
--
which
one
of
your
honors
inquired,
taking
our
testimony
at
its
best
as
the
jury
verdict
entitles
us
to
do,
i
think,
the
$300.00
was
not
taken
with
the
statement
that
it
was
a
poor
claim
but
he'd
take
the
$300
for
a
cost.
but
the
$300.00
using
an
inference
which
a
person
of
ordinary
reasonable
understanding
would
take
and
which
i
am
sure
the
jury
took
was
--
is
what
a
man
in
the
street
would
call
a
lug.
it
was
completely
without
authority;
it
was
outrageous
and
the
word
i
used
is
the
word
of
one
of
the
union
officials
when
asked
about
that.
it
was
improper
and
again
that
word
is
in
quotes
from
one
of
the
union
officials
when
asked
if
such
a
thing
could
be
done.
so
much
for
the
fact
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
suspect
and
by
inference
that
it
was
to
go
to
the
individual
because
the
officials
termed
it
improper,
you
see
and
therefore,
i
think,
the
jury
was
entitled
to
say
that
it
was
in
plain
language
a
“lug.”
mr.
allan
r.
browne
two.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
two
of
the
officials
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
in
the
record.
i'm
not
talking
out
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
in
the
record
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
to
me,
it
is.
and
i
haven't
gone
to
use
that
strong
language,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
to
me
it
is.
what
else
could
it
be
when
they
termed
it
outrageous
and
improper.
but
then
again,
this
goes
to
the
arbitrary
and
the
malicious
actions.
now
may
i
just
quickly
advert
to
what
the
whole
case
is
based
upon
in
our
view
which
is
upon
an
arbitrary
and
a
malicious
act
by
an
agent,
we
say
a
faceless
agent.
this
has
other
support
than
just
this
one
--
a
matter
and
we
have
outlined
a
number
of
those
in
our
brief
which
you
can
of
course
get
as
quickly
as
i
could
give
them
to
you
here
but
in
short,
one
of
them
is
that
this
very
person
who
asked
for
the
“lug”
had
a
freudian
slip
in
his
testimony
and
he
said
that
dismissing
the
grievance
clandestinely
one
month
before
the
case
was
tried,
if
you
please,
was
in
retaliation
for
bringing
the
suit,
then
later
he
corrected
himself.
but
there
again,
this
is
a
point
which
i
feel
that
this
court
has
a
right
to
take
but
its
common
sense
in
the
consideration
in
which
the
jury
did
take.
there
are
other
things
involved
in
the
question
of
arbitrariness
and
maliciousness
in
connection
with
faithless
representation
by
an
agent
of
his
principal
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
arbitrary
is
a
court
concept
in
the
gonzales
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
in
other
cases
and
this
is
the
basis
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
used
in
its
opinion
entirely
in
which
we'll
bring
in
just
a
moment
to
the
question
of
discrimination
then
known,
an
important
feature
in
this
case
as
i
see
it.
yes
sir,
the
action
in
the
--
began
in
the
missouri
case
is
based
upon
a
breach
of
a
contract
or
a
faithless
failure
by
an
agent
to
represent
his
principal.
the
contract,
being
the
duty,
it
is
true
is
set
out
by
the
bargaining
contract
but
of
course
there's
a
common
law
duty
in
addition
and
it
is
laid
under
our
view
as
an
internal
matter
involving
the
internal
operations
of
the
union,
the
petitioners.
it
is
laid
as
arbitrary
and
malicious
and
when
i
say
laid
down
meaning
the
petition,
of
course,
and
nowhere
in
the
petition,
in
the
evidence,
in
the
submission
by
instructions
to
the
jury
is
unfair
labor
practice
or
discrimination
mentioned
or
adverted
to.
this,
in
our
view,
is
a
simple
case
brought
under
the
common
law
duty
of
an
agent
faithfully
to
represent
and
the
agent,
its
true
became
the
agent
by
virtue
of
the
bargaining
contract
and
even
perhaps
by
the
statute
as
counsel
mentioned.
but
however,
he
became
the
agent,
his
duty
still
remains
governed
in
one
instance,
in
or
view,
by
state
law.
now
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
understand
your
question,
i
think.
no
sir,
of
course
not
because
this
would
put
an
impossible
burden
upon
everybody
concerned.
now
we've
nowhere
urged
that
but
the
touchstone,
your
honor,
is
as
i
see
it
is
arbitrary
or
malicious
actions,
then
they
must
respond.
but
only
then
and
that
is
the
touchstone
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
used
in
its
opinion.
it
confined
itself
solely
to
that.
it
discussed
other
features
of
course
and
incidentally,
now
the
question
is
raised
of
discretionary
power
of
the
union
which
has
some
nixes
with
your
question,
i
think,
and
as
to
discretionary
power,
the
union
does
have
discretionary
power;
it
must.
we
are
the
first
to
recognize
that.
but
to
what
limit
because
we
can
have
tyranny
in
union
officials
as
well
as
in
other
places
and
therefore,
the
law
must
have
some
control,
i
feel,
in
regulating
that
and
the
law
has
said
it
will
take
control
especially
in
the
gonzales
case
and
in
other
cases
since
that
time
by
regulating
arbitrary
and
malicious
actions.
these
are
our
points
in
this
particular
frame
of
factual
matter,
we
feel.
first,
if
i
--
i'm
not
putting
them
in
order
of
importance,
but
the
$300.00
averages
an
improper
request.
i
don't
and
probably
shouldn't
use
the
word
“lug”
because
it's
a
bare
knuckle
word
but
it
certainly
was
a
strange
thing.
they
didn't
deny
it
in
a
sense
because
in
their
evidence,
they
came
out
and
tried
to
turn
it
around
and
say
that
mr.
owens
had
requested,
had
said
he
would
give
$300.00
to
vaca
or
somebody
if
he
could
win
the
case
for
him,
like
on
a
contingent
basis.
you
see,
this
was
for
the
jury,
we
feel.
but
it
was
not
just
an
isolated
thing
that
mr.
owens
had
made
up
because
they
took
it
on
and
tried
to
turn
it
around
the
other
way.
now,
this
retaliation
business
is
significant
to
on
this
arbitrary
question,
if
you
please.
and
another
thing
is
the
clandestine
dismissal
one
month
before
this
case
was
tried,
if
you
please.
the
grievance
then
being
in
the
fourth
step,
there
were
five
altogether,
the
fifth
is
the
only
meaningful
one
in
a
really
contested
case
because
the
others
are
all
presented
to
the
employer.
the
meaningful
one
is
the
fifth
step
when
you
go
to
a
neutral
arbitrator
that
was
the
one
where
the
union
bought.
now
another
point
along
that
line,
if
i
may
continue
with
these
points
is
that
the
union
all
along
the
line
had
publicly
declared
that
this
claim
was
meritorious;
they
said
it
was
meritorious.
they
had
all
of
these
doctors'
statements,
six
to
two.
and
when
we
challenged
the
--
one
of
their
officials
at
the
trial
as
to
how
he
could
say
that
it
was
meritorious
at
one
time
and
then
at
another
time
no,
it's
not;
why
his
answer
was,
“well
we
might
the
twist
some
facts
a
little
bit
to
suit
the
occasion.”
to
me,
this
too,
adds
to
the
general
pile
of
arbitrary
actions
that
are
shown
by
the
evidence
here.
then
we
get
to
the
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
yes.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
we
had
an
action
gone
--
going
but
it
to
me
is
contingent
upon
the
decision
here.
i
think
it
may
be
inconsistent
with
this
and
it
has
been
held
in
advance
by
the
court
below.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
think
we'd
have
trouble
with
the
case
against
the
employer
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
please?
mr.
allan
r.
browne
well,
no
i
think
this
that
we
didn't
exhaust
our
remedies
to
the
employer
and
that
he
has
a
defense
there,
you
see.
that's
our
peak
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
we
didn't
exhaust
our
remedies
and
that's
what
this
suit
is
about
because
the
union
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
--
wouldn't
help
us
to
exhaust
the
remedy.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
he
would
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
he
has
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
he
has
said
it.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
but
we
haven't
exhausted
our
remedies
against
him
and
must
i
admit
that
he
may
have
some
merit
there.
and
so
that's
why
this
suit
is
brought
because
if
we
haven't
exhausted
our
remedies
we
can't
recover
against
the
employer
where
we
had
a
meritorious
claim
we
say.
and
now
here
we
are
flatfooted
there
and
therefore
the
people
who
put
us
in
that
position
are
the
petitioners
or
the
defendants
here,
that's
our
whole
case,
your
honor.
have
i
answered
that?
mr.
allan
r.
browne
the
breach
of
the
duty
without
any
collusion
between
the
employer
and
the
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
--
and
the
union
--
oh
i
think
so.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
well,
i
--
arbitrary
action
is
sufficient
and
coupled
with
malice,
there
--
the
legal
definition
of
malice
of
course
here,
i
think,
is
there
is
actual
malice.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
think
it
may
in
its
way
but
i
don'
think
it's
exclusive
and
here
i
get
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
some
degree
of
what?
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
know
they
govern
it.
the
federal
law
must
govern
as
should
the
law.
i'm
not
talking
about
forum.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
i
agree
entirely
and
wholeheartedly
the
federal
law
construing
what
the
duties
are
--
must
govern
and
you've
said
that
a
number
of
times
it
has
been
said
all
over.
so
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
feature.
the
question
--
mr.
allan
r.
browne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
r.
browne
similar,
yes,
your
honor.
lynn
is
one
of
the
case
upon
which
you
relied
and
--
but
i
would
with
your
permission
like
to
rephrase
that
just
slightly
and
say
not
that
i'm
asking
you
to
make
such
a
rule
but
i
think
there
is
such
a
rule
as
laid
out
by
gonzales
and
by
dowd.
dowd,
a
fairly
recent
case
in
which
my
distinguished
opponent
was
on
the
other
side
there,
and
which
this
court
said
that
there
were
state
forums
in
matters
that
had
federal
roots
shall
we
say
or
whatever
term
would
be
best
used,
and
in
addition,
a
number
of
other
cases.
i
like
the
dowd
case
which
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
and
i
like
the
gonzales
case,
when
i
say
i
like
i
mean
i
think
it
sets
out
these
principles
the
best.
the
gonzales
case
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
really
lays
it
out
in
very
clear
language
to
me
by
saying
that
certain
areas
are
not
taken
by
the
federal
forum.
they're
not
preempted.
the
federal
authority
can
operate
in
those
areas
and
the
dowd
case
made
that
very
clear
by
saying
that
these
are
things
the
state
still
are
on
board
with.
the
state
still
are
operating
very
well.
and
the
question
along
that
line
was
raised
that
there
be
conflict
between
the
federal
decisions
in
the
state.
you
still
control
that
and
i
think
it
was
in
the
dowd
case
that
you
said
that
this
is
the
appropriate
place
to
reconcile
any
such
differences
and
i
presume
that
that's
what's
happening
now
if
there
is
any
such
difference.
now,
not
only
the
lynn
case
but
there
are
several,
the
smith,
the
news
case.
the
maddox
case
written
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
the
russell
case
together
with
the
old
faithful
love
burnham
which
--
with
which
you're
all
very
familiar,
i'm
sure.
i
would
like
with
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left
to
discuss
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
have
said
that
court
jurisdiction
is
superior
to
board
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
a
climate.
this,
i'm
not
talking
about
state
courts
only
because
this
question
involves
federal
courts
of
course
as
well
as
state.
this
happens
to
be
from
the
state
jurisdiction
but
--
and
that
is
a
question
of
inadequacy
of
remedy.
a
board
is
limited,
we
know
that,
but
a
state
court
has
additional
powers.
this
is
highlighted
in
this
particular
case.
the
inadequacy
of
what
board
relief
would
have
been.
the
board
relief
can
hardly
be
a
deterrent
and
award
punitive
damages
such
as
can
be
awarded
in
a
court
case.
is
that
important?
it
seems
to
have
great
importance
because
we're
dealing
in
the
big
picture.
it
seems
to
me
with
the
question
of
deterrent
effect.
we're
dealing
with
the
possibility
of
you
might
say
despotic
--
oh,
that's
a
strong
word
or
tyrannical,
over
exercise
of
power.
this
is
an
--
synonym
perhaps
for
arbitrary
and
malicious
actions
certainly
for
arbitrary
actions
and
there
you
can
control
that
best
by
punitive
damages.
you
can
restore
a
man
to
his
job
but
if
he's
dead
or
if
the
worry
of
being
out
of
work
for
four
years
has
made
him
unfit
to
go
on
then
you
have
a
sterile
remedy.
so
a
board's
power
there
is
useless.
but
a
court,
while
it
is
not
omnipotent
in
its
powers
can
do
a
lot
more.
it
may
be
that
if
there
are
many
actions
like
this
in
the
air
now
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
if
there
are
or
not,
that
it
is
a
fine
thing
that
you
have
said
from
the
point
of
view
of
national
welfare
that
you
have
said
that
state
courts
or
federal
courts
shall
have
concurrent,
if
you
will,
jurisdiction
with
the
boards
that
that
is
a
fine
thing
because
it
will
serve
the
national
interest
and
it
will
serve
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
theories
of
industrial
peace.
thank
you
very
much.
