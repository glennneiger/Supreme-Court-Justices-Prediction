mr.
david
e.
feller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
as
that
court
imposed
a
judgment
of
$10,000;
$7,000
compensatory
and
$3,000
punitive
on
the
members
of
the
national
brotherhood
of
packinghouse
workers
were
represented
here
by
the
petitioners
who
had
been
sued
as
representative
of
the
class
of
the
members
of
that
union.
the
basis
of
the
suit
to
originally
found
--
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
jackson
county,
missouri
was
in
essence
that
the
union
had
failed
to
process
the
grievance,
a
grievance
to
arbitration.
the
facts,
i
think,
are
relevantly
simple.
benjamin
owens
who
was
originally
the
plaintiff,
now
deceased,
was
a
worker
in
a
swift
packinghouse
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
the
union
there
is
the
national
brotherhood
of
packinghouse
workers,
an
independent
union.
mr.
owens
had
a
long
history
of
heart
trouble
and
high
blood
pressure.
he
had
been
treated
in
hospitals
since
1956.
in
may
of
1959,
he
felt
so
bad
that
he
felt
he
had
to
take
off
work
and
did
take
off
work.
under
the
contract,
it
was
a
sick
leave
provision.
you
have
to
be
disabled
in
order
to
draw
the
sick
leave.
he
reported
to
the
company
doctor.
the
company
doctor
took
his
blood
pressure
and
he
said,
“you
won’t
hold,
you'll
get
your
sick
leave.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
not
precisely
sure.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
any
case,
he
went
home,
in
fact
went
to
the
hospital,
remained
under
treatment.
he
made
one
effort
to
come
back
to
work.
he
was
then
examined,
the
company
doctor
said
he
was
unfit
to
work.
he
made
a
second
effort
when
his
sick
leave
had
expired,
he
had
6
months,
27
weeks
of
sick
leave
to
come
back
to
work.
the
company
refused
to
permit
him
to
come
back
to
work
and
he
filed
a
grievance
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
union
asked
him
to
produce
doctor's
certificates
saying
he
was
able
to
work
and
he
produced
a
great
number
of
certificates
saying
either
what
his
blood
pressure
was,
reciting
his
blood
pressure
or
reciting
that
he
was
able
to
work.
and
the
union
processed
the
grievance
through
the
four
steps
provided
under
its
collecting
bargaining
agreement
beginning
up
a
foreman's
level
and
working
up
to
the
national
union
level
and
the
company
refused
to
put
him
back
to
work.
now
the
fourth
step
involved
the
national
representatives
of
the
union
and
we
do
have
in
the
record
here
report
of
what
happened
in
the
fourth
step.
the
company
took
the
position
that
it
could
not
in
view
of
its
own
records
as
to
its
previous
history
and
as
to
its
doctor's
report
put
him
back
to
work
simply
on
certificates
saying
mr.
owens
is
able
to
work
or
mr.
owens'
blood
pressure
is
so
and
so.
but
it
would
require
further
evidence.
the
union
then
after
the
fourth
step
making
tried
to
persuade
--
there
was
a
joint
effort
to
try
to
persuade
mr.
owens
to
apply
to
do
other
work
or
to
apply
for
social
security
disability
pension
under
social
security.
he
rejected
that
and
so
the
union
said,
“go
to
your
doctor,
we
will
pay
for
it,
and
get
an
examination,
a
complete
examination
that
will
give
us
the
kind
of
evidence
we
need
to
get
you
back
to
work.”
he
went
to
one
of
the
doctors
who
had
provided
the
certificate.
according
to
his
testimony,
the
doctor
said
he
was
not
equipped
to
give
him
a
complete
physical
examination
of
the
kind
requested
and
referred
him
to
a
heart
specialist.
mr.
owens
went
to
the
heart
specialist,
the
heart
specialist
examined
him,
concluded
that
he
was
totally
unable
to
work;
that
no
employer
could
hire
him
because
the
work
was
compensation
liabilities;
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled
and
eligible
for
the
social
security
sent
such
report
to
the
union.
union
executive
board
met,
decided,
the
motion
was
made
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
nevertheless.
the
union
executive
board
decided
in
the
light
of
this
report,
it
would
not
take
the
case
to
arbitration
but
even
then
did
not
withdraw
the
grievance,
left
it
pending
in
a
hold
status
in
the
event
that
something
later
should
develop
that
would
enable
him
to
get
mr.
owens
back
to
work.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it
was
really
chosen
by
his
own
doctor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
he
went
to
dr.
hesser
and
dr.
hesser
recommended
dr.
day
to
him.
the
union
had
no
choice
in
the
doctor.
the
union
said,
“go
get
a
doctor
and
we
will
pay
the
cost
and
get
us
some
evidence
so
we
can
take
this
case
to
arbitration.”
after
the
union
did
not
take
the
case
to
arbitration,
mr.
owens
then
brought
suit,
he
actually
filed
two
suits.
he
filed
a
suit
against
the
company
claiming
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
he
filed
a
separate
suit
against
the
union
claiming
essentially
the
same
thing,
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
also
claiming
that
the
union
had
wrongfully,
improperly,
arbitrarily
refused
to
take
the
grievance
to
arbitration.
the
case
against
the
company
has
never
been
tried,
still
pending
from
my
stipulation
of
the
parties,
awaiting
result
in
this
case.
the
case
against
the
union
was
tried
to
a
jury.
the
essence,
they
tried
the
merits
of
the
grievance
before
the
jury.
the
testimony
--
there
were
no
medical
testimony.
incidentally,
they've
put
--
the
doctor's
certificates
were
put
into
evidence.
dr.
day's
report
was
put
in
evidence
and
there
was
much
testimony
as
to
the
nature
of
the
kind
of
work
that
mr.
owens
had
done
since
he'd
left
swift
and
how
well
he
felt
and
how
he
played
ball
and
did
a
lot
of
other
things.
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
$7,000
compensatory
damage,
$3,300
punitive
damage
against
the
union.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
and
in
col.
brown
in
the
theory
of
the
suit
was
that
the
union
was
owens'
agent
and
it
had
wrongfully
refused
to
take
his
grievance
to
arbitration.
that's
--
as
--
that's
i
think
the
statement
in
the
complaint.
i
think
that's
the
statement
--
the
question
that
was
given
to
the
jury
by
the
judge's
charge.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
i
think
was
the
--
i
would
characterize
it
that.
i
don't
think
they
–
anybody
used
that
language.
mr.
david
e.
feller
again,
the
answer
is
yes,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out.
no
reference
was
made
to
any
federal
decisions,
any
federal
law
and
col.
brown
here
takes
the
position
that
this
is
a
simple
common
law
principal-agent
relationship
and
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
do
not
know.
i
simply
do
not
know.
in
any
case,
the
jury
entered
the
verdict
then
the
interesting
part
happened.
the
trial
court
set
aside
the
verdict
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
matter
exclusively
for
the
national
relations
board.
owens
then
appealed.
a
few
weeks
after
he
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
before
it
was
argued
in
the
kansas
city
court
of
appeals,
he
died.
he
died
incidentally
precisely
of
the
ailment
that
dr.
day
said
he
would
die
of
if
he
went
back
to
work.
his
administrator
continued
the
appeal.
kansas
city
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
trial
court's
setting
aside
of
the
verdict
on
preemption
grounds
but
referred
it
then
because
there
was
a
dissent
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
reversed,
holding
that
the
matter
was
not
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
precisely
because
there
was
no
claim
and
no
evidence
of
bad
faith
or
discrimination
against
owens.
there
was
no
showing
that
the
union
had
used
--
was
--
wanted
to
get
rid
of
owens
but
it
was
just
simply
a
question
whether
the
grievance
was
a
good
one
and
then
it
passed
to
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict.
it
found
that
there
was
because
there
was
conflict
between
the
medical
certificates
on
one
side
of
the
other
and
sustained
the
judgment,
doing
only
one
thing,
reducing
the
punitive
damages
to
$3,300
because
it
was
more
than
the
addendum
in
the
complaint
to
$3,000.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
this
court
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
a
very
curious
claim
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
i
think
i
have
to
treat
it
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
other
side
and
i
will
just
tell
you
what
mr.
owens
said
on
the
stand.
mr.
owens
said
that
mr.
vaca,
the
president
of
the
local
union,
told
him
that
the
grievance
was
no
good
and
that
the
local
union
didn't
have
any
money.
but
that
if
he
would
pay
$300,
then
certainly
they
would
see
what
they
could
do,
or
they
would
take
it
to
arbitration.
mr.
owens
was
asked
what
was
the
$300
for?
he
said,
“to
pay
the
cost
of
the
arbitration.”
now,
there
was
contrary
testimony,
i
think,
and
the
fair
reading
of
the
record
is
that
what
really
happened
is
what
mr.
jamerson
said
who
had
wanted
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
regard
himself
as
owens'
representative
and
he
said
that
owens
had
come
to
him
and
he
said,
“if
you'll
take
the
case
to
arbitration,
i'll
give
you
$300.”
but
in
any
case
accepting
owens'
statement,
what
vaca
said
to
him
is,
“this
is
a
no
good
grievance
but
if
you're
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
it,
we'll
take
it
to
arbitration.”
and
that's
on
owens'
own
testimony.
he
was
twice
asked
on
this
on
the
record
and
in
both
times
said
that
the
$300
was
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
arbitration.
now
vaca
denied
ever
doing
that,
he
said,
“if
it's
a
good
grievance
we'll
take
it
up,
if
it's
a
bad
grievance
we
wouldn't
take
it
up
and
i
wouldn't
ask
for
the
$300
in
any
case.”
but
a
secong
their
version,
the
plaintiff's
version,
the
only
thing
that
the
union
did
here
was
to
say,
“well,
if
we
--
if
you
want
us
to
take
a
bad
grievance,
which
we
can't
win
the
arbitration,
you
pay
the
cost.”
$300
wouldn't
be
the
cost
of
it
in
any
case.
before
i
finish,
i
--
my
partner
tells
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
he
was
51
at
the
time
of
trial,
mr.
owens
was
51
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question,
i
think,
in
this
case,
most
significant
one,
is
the
nature
and
extent
of
a
union's
responsibility
in
processing
or
refusing
to
process
grievances
under
a
typical
grievance
procedure.
well
let
me
state
at
the
outset
it
is
argued
that
this
is
a
federal
duty
imposed
by
federal
statute
and
governed
by
federal
standards.
section
9
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
“that
if
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
a
collective
bargaining
unit
choose
a
union
as
their
representative,
it
shall
be
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
those
employees
in
dealing
with
matters
with
regards
to
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
and
that
includes
not
only
the
negotiation
of
an
agreement
but
by
the
specific
terms
of
the
statute,
the
processing
of
grievances
under
that
agreement.”
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
of
principal
and
agent,
the
common
law
of
principal
and
agent,
has
nothing
to
do
with
membership,
the
duty
runs
to
all
persons
in
the
bargaining
unit,
members
or
not.
the
authority
which
the
union
is
granted
by
section
9
act,
this
court
has
said,
“imposes
upon
that
union
a
responsibility.”
and
that
responsibility
we
believe
is
a
federal
responsibility,
the
limits
of
that
responsibility
and
the
remedies
where
that
responsibility
is
not
met
are,
we
think,
matters
of
federal
law.
now
that
federal
law
is
suggested
in
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
i
think,
as
this
court,
we
believe,
that
duty
should
be
defined
by
this
court
in
light
of
the
institution
we're
talking
about.
the
grievance
procedures
are
rather
remarkable
institution;
it's
not
explicitly
provided
for
in
any
statute.
it
exists
in
almost
every
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it's
a
uniquely
american
contribution
to
social
institutions
of
this
world.
it
is
a
procedure
by
which
the
union,
acting
for
the
employees,
processes
through
steps
initially
the
employee
initiates
the
grievance,
succeeding
steps
of
the
hierarchy
both
on
the
union
side
and
the
company
side,
complaints
that
the
company
has
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
essential
to
the
operation
of
this
kind
of
procedure
is
the
assumption
which
both
parties
made.
that
the
union
will
act
responsibly
in
administering
its
side
of
the
procedure
and
that
will
in
fact
take
two
arbitration
if
arbitration
is
provided.
and
indeed
will
take
only
to
the
next
step
those
grievances
which
it
finds
are
meritorious.
the
system
could
not
exist,
literally
could
not
exist,
if
the
union
were
obliged,
as
the
agent
of
each
employee,
to
take
each
grievance
irrespective
of
its
use
of
the
merits,
all
the
way
through
the
procedure
and
to
arbitration.
indeed,
i
would
be
less
than
frank
if
i
say
that
the
greatest
problem
faced
by
those
unions
in
administering
a
grievance
procedure
is
the
problem
that
all
of
the
political
push
in
the
other
way,
after
all
the
union
exist
in
the
given
plan
only
if
the
majority
of
the
employees
have
selected
that
union,
they
have
a
right
to
change
it.
the
officers
of
that
union
run
for
election,
required
to
run
for
election,
every
three
years,
the
maximum
period,
under
the
landon
griffin
act.
the
easiest
thing
for
a
union
representative
to
do
when
a
member
comes
to
him
and
says,
“i
have
been
--
company's
violated
the
agreement
in
this
way,
that
way”
is
to
pass
it
on
through
the
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure
and
take
it
to
arbitration
and
if
the
man
losses
it's
just
because
we
had
a
lousy
arbitrator,
“it's
not
my
fault,
vote
for
me
next
time.”
and
in
the
literature
and
as
i
say
in
actual
experience,
the
greatest
problem
is
when
unions
do
not
exercise
their
responsibility
and
do
not
screen
out
the
grievances,
do
not
eliminate
those
which
do
not
present
generally
--
genuinely
meritorious
issues.
if
unions
do
not
do
that,
the
procedure
collapses.
and
the
question
in
this
case
really
then
is,
“does
the
law,
the
federal
law,
governing
the
relationship
provide
that
an
employee
who
is
not
satisfied
with
the
way
the
union
has
handled
it's
grievances,
provided
that
that
employee
can
go
to
court
and
have
a
court
or
a
jury,
under
this
case
a
jury,
express
its
opinions
as
to
the
grievance
and
award
damages
against
the
union?”
if
every
union
have
issued,
must
have
looking
over
its
shoulder,
the
possibility
of
a
court
suit
if
it
decides
that
this
grievance
is
no
good.
then
the
unfortunate
tendency
not
to
swing
grievances
will
be
magnified
a
hundredfold.
and
indeed,
the
short
period
since
this
lawsuit
was
first
decided,
the
people
in
the
business
tell
me
that
they
were
all
--
is
already
on
effect.
now
that
doesn't
mean
of
course
that
the
union
is
free
to
decide
not
take
any
grievance
for
any
reason
or
no
reason.
the
union
is
the
administrating
agents
for
the
employees
in
this
case.
and
the
same
standards
which
this
court
has
laid
down
the
exercise
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
the
negotiation
of
an
agreement,
we
think
apply
to
the
grievance
procedure
in
the
determination
of
the
union
not
to
process
a
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
a
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
not
to
take
a
complaint
to
arbitration
in
this
case.
or
for
that
matter,
i
suppose
this
question
is
the
same,
where
there
is
no
arbitration
at
the
end,
you
know
there
are
a
number
of
industries
in
this
country,
general
electric
placed
in
the
newspapers
most
recently
where
grievances
are
not
ordinarily
arbitratable,
only
discharge
grievances
are
arbitratable
in
general
electric.
other
grievances,
you
go
through
a
procedure.
the
procedure
is
the
same,
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
fourth
step,
whatever
the
numbered
step
is,
and
then
the
union
has
the
option
of
striking
you
or
not.
that's
the
old
fashion
way.
and
i
suppose
the
same
question
would
be
raised
where
the
union
says,
“we
don't
think
this
grievance
is
worth
striking
about.”
there
are
those
who
believe
that
when
the
grievance
procedure
doesn't
work,
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
get
rid
of
this
arbitration
business
because
the
union
keeps
taking
this
frivolous
cases
to
arbitration
and
eliminate
arbitration
and
put
the
strike
provision
in.
but
in
any
case,
it
is
our
view
that
the
federal
duty
is
what
this
court
has
said
that
duty
is.
in
ford
motor
company
against
huffman,
in
humphrey
against
moore,
and
that
is
a
duty
to
do
its
best
in
good
faith,
exercise
its
responsibility
to
all
the
employees
in
handling
the
individual
grievances
of
any
one.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
the
next
question,
your
honor,
assuming
that
that
is
the
duty,
we
have
a
very
difficult
question
as
to
whether
that
duty
is
enforceable
to
the
courts
or
through
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
i've
said
that
this
duty
is
a
federal
duty
imposed
by
section
9
(a)
of
the
act
as
this
court
has
construed
section
9
(a).
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
necessarily
saying
that
a
violation
of
that
duty
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
of
the
act.
the
board
is
given
authority
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practices,
i.e.
violations
of
section
8
of
the
act.
but
not
every
interference
with
the
right
guaranteed
by
section
7
or
the
rights
and
obligations
implicit
in
section
9
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
simplest
case
is
of
course,
when
not
an
employer
but
somebody
else
interferes
with
the
employees
in
engaging
their
right
to
strike
or
a
state
passes
a
law
that
you
can't
strike.
that
law
--
that
impinges
on
rights
protected
by
section
7
but
it's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
question
of
whether
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
not
is
a
much
litigated
one,
the
solicitor
general
has
supplied
a
memorandum
that
it
gave
to
the
court
yesterday,
the
most
recent
decision
on
the
question
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
fifth
circuit,
local
12
of
the
rubber
workers
versus
nlrb
which
sustains
the
board's
present
view,
a
view
which
it
has
adopted
quite
recently.
that
precisely
what
was
involved
here,
the
refusal
to
process
a
grievance
but
in
that
case
found
to
be
for
discriminatory
reasons,
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now
if
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
i
really
express
an
opinion
on
it
and
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
decide
it
in
this
case.
if
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
clearly,
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
believe
it
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
let
me
address
myself
directly
to
that.
the
complaint
against
the
union
for
failing
to
process
a
grievance,
it
is
a
complaint
that
it
has
failed
to
perform
a
duty
imposed
by
the
law
not
by
any
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
know
it's
improper
for
me
to
ask
your
honor
questions
but
i
don't
what
contract
it
can
be
said
the
union
is
violating.
the
employer
has
presumably
in
this
case
violated
a
contract
and
that's
why
the
employee
has
a
complaint,
and
if
he
sues
the
employer
or
if
he
sues
the
employer
and
the
union
jointly,
in
that
lawsuit
is
a
complaint
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
contract.
but
the
question
where
he
sues
the
union,
he
is
suing
it
for
breach
of
its
obligation
to
represent
him.
that
does
not
derive
from
contract;
indeed
it
has
that
same
obligation
to
represent
him
irrespective
of
what
is
in
the
contract
or
indeed,
if
there
is
no
contract
at
all.
it
is
his
agent,
his
representative,
pursuant
to
section
9
(a)
and
therefore
the
duty
which
is
being
enforced
in
our
--
my
view
is
a
duty
imposed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
in
the
section
301
cases,
in
smith
versus
evening
news,
we
have
conduct
a
breach
of
a
contract
which
is
in
violation
allegedly
of
both
a
contractual
obligation
and
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
law,
that
case
of
discriminatory
discharge.
this
court
held
in
smith
versus
evening
news
that
the
fact
if
you
have
violated
the
law
by
the
same
conduct
which
you
have
violated
the
contract
does
not
mean
that
you
cannot
proceed
to
obtain
a
remedy
for
the
violation
of
the
contract.
but
all
that
is
being
sought
for
relief
in
this
case
is
a
violation
of
the
statutory
obligation.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
proper
for
the
employer
to
be
agreeing
as
to
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
let's
throw
those
a
constitution
which
is
dial
--
or
an
agreement
between
the
union
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
alright.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
the
employer
and
union
agree
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
the
employee
would
then
sue
as
kind
of
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
contract
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
well,
i
can
conceive
in
that
case
--
i
will
--
no,
i've
never
seen
such
a
contract.
you
could
argue
that
as
a
third
part
beneficiary,
he
could
sue
and
the
standards
would
then
be
the
contractual
standards.
he
would
be
suing
for
the
violation
of
the
contract
and
it
may
say
imposes
stricter
standard
or
a
looser
standard.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
then
the
standards
in
enforcing
a
contract
would
be
the
same
standards
in
the
law
then
presumably
you
would
be
seeking
to
enforce
the
contract.
but
you
would
not
be
seeking
--
but
in
this
case,
and
in
no
case
that
i
have
ever
heard
of,
are
you
seeking
to
enforce
a
contract?
you
are
seeking
to
enforce
a
duty
defined
by
the
statute
and
bounded
by
the
statute.
now
if
that
duty
is
enforceable
through
the
procedure
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
arguably
so
under
the
government
standard,
then
the
courts
--
there
is
no
situation
except
the
particular
expressed
congressional
provision
in
section
303
of
the
act
that
you
can
also
sue
for
breach
of
secondary
boycott.
there
are
no
other
situations
i
know
in
which
a
duty
imposed
by
the
federal
act
is
enforceable
both
by
the
courts
and
the
national
labor
relations.
now,
if
this
is
and
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
simply
permit
that
question
here
as
you
did
in
the
huffman
case
because
i
think
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
without
dealing
it
with
it
and
i
would
be
embarrassed
to
tell
you
the
truth
if
your
honors
would
say
its
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
here
and
then
got
the
rubber
workers
case
which
petition
for
cert
is
going
to
be
filed
and
then
found
it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
far
flagship
cases,
your
honors
dealt
with
that
very
nicely.
you
had
the
two
cases
together,
the
one
you
said
its
not
enough,
the
labor
act
doesn't
apply
and
therefore
in
the
second
one
you
could
say
it's
no
longer
arguable.
and
unfortunately,
we're
here
before
the
rubber
workers
case
was
here.
now,
i'd
like
if
i
may
your
honors,
just
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
e.
feller
very
briefly,
if
your
honor
may.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
precisely
to
what
counsel
just
referred
to
the
question
of
remedy.
we
dealt
with
it,
i
think
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
and
it
is
our
view
that
wholly
apart
from
the
other
questions
in
this
case
that
the
remedy
in
damages
is
in
any
case
an
inappropriate
remedy.
it
--
because
first
of
all,
it
requires
the
court
to
try
the
merits
of
the
grievance
because
you
can't
find
damages
unless
you
find
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract
as
well
as
a
failure
of
duty
of
representation.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
our
view
is
that
that
is
what
it
should
do
and
if
it
so
found,
should
order
that
the
case
be
then
taken
to
arbitration.
precisely
that
remedy.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
the
damages
would
be
what
the
arbitrator
would
award
under
the
contract
as
the
remedy
for
the
breach.
now
if
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
come
to
that
question
as
i've
said
without
necessarily
involving
the
court
and
the
jury
in
trying
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
and
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
--
let's
take
this
case,
this
discharge
case,
we
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
direct
that
the
case
be
taken
to
arbitration
and
the
union
should
be
responsible
for
any
loss
which
has
been
suffered
by
the
individual
as
a
result
of
its
delay
in
proceeding
to
arbitration
which
is
precisely
the
only
loss
which
he
suffered
if
--
in
the
hypothetical
which
you've
put.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
only
after
arbitration.
i
mean
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
as
essentially
the
union
is
in
a
quasi-governmental
position
here.
it's
like
in
administrative
agency.
let
me
be
perfectly
frank,
it's
got
to
prosecute
on
behalf
of
the
employees
and
it's
a
bipartisan
joint
government
and
i
think
the
remedies
here
are
exactly
the
same
as
they
are
or
very
much
like
when
you
have
a
governmental
agency
which
doesn't
proceed
when
it
should
proceed.
if
an
official
doesn't
proceed
when
he
should,
you
go
into
court
and
require
him
to
proceed.
i
doubt
that
you
--
and
i
find
no
authority
for
inflicting
punitive
damages
or
even
compensatory
damages
upon
the
government
official
when
he
doesn't
do
what
he
should
do
under
the
statute.
mr.
david
e.
feller
they
do
not,
your
honor,
and
that
would
bring
me
exactly
to
the
arbitrary
and
malicious
thing.
the
instruction
which
appears
on
pages
159
to
161
which
is
the
critical
instruction,
i
regret
asking
your
honors
to
look
at
that
because
it's
difficult
to
read.
the
critical
part
of
it
is
quoted
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
its
opinion
on
page
216
of
the
record
and
that
is
the
question
as
each
the
court
says,
the
issue
submitted
to
the
jury
was
whether
the
union
as
plaintiff's
agent
arbitrarily
--
no
malicious
notion,
just
arbitrarily.
if
so
and
without
just
cause
or
excuse,
if
so,
and
thus
with
legal
malice,
if
so,
refuse
to
carry
said
grievance
differences
and
disagreement
through
the
fifth
step.
now
it
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
well
the
problem
in
instruction
number
5
is
it
says
that
acted
reasonably.
instruction
number
6
says
that
it
acted
wrongly
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
or
wrongly,
or
wrongly.
each
of
those
instructions
and
the
arbitrarily
instructions
essentially
permit
the
jury
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
grievance
and
that's
the
only
evidence
which
they
had.
it's
perfectly
clear
on
the
$300.00
incidentally,
the
reference
--
the
jury
was
not
even
given
that
issue.
the
court
in
it's
--
and
i
take
it
under
missouri
law
you
have
to
hypothesize
all
the
facts
in
the
case.
the
court
in
its
instruction
to
the
jury
did
not
require
the
jury
to
find
that
this
$300.00
has
been
testified.
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
no
reference
to
it
at
all
in
instruction
number
2
which
is
the
key
instruction.
the
question
before
the
jury
was
--
very
simply
was,
did
the
union
wrongly,
arbitrarily,
unreasonably
refused
to
process
this
grievance
and
what
they
tried
to
the
jury
to
come
to
the
answer
to
that
is
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
and
indeed,
as
i
say
the
missouri
supreme
court
expressly
said
there
was
no
discrimination,
none
of
this
business
about
we
don't
like
your
conduct
in
the
union
hall
because
they
said
that
if
it
did,
that
would
be
unfair
labor
practice
and
we
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
so
we
have
jurisdiction
only
because
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
conduct
here.
and
so
essentially,
of
course,
i
said
the
constructions
are
wrong
even
if
the
instructions
were
right.
i
think
there's
some
minimum
quantum
of
evidence
as
to
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
which
have
been
required
and
the
plaintiff
produced
none
here
and
the
defendant
rebutted
whatever
inference
could
be
brought
in
the
plaintiff's
testimony
as
to
precisely
the
reason
union
acted.
it
acted
after
it
got
dr.
day's
report
and
dr.
day's
report
said
this
man
is
unemployable.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
david
e.
feller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
as
that
court
imposed
a
judgment
of
$10,000;
$7,000
compensatory
and
$3,000
punitive
on
the
members
of
the
national
brotherhood
of
packinghouse
workers
were
represented
here
by
the
petitioners
who
had
been
sued
as
representative
of
the
class
of
the
members
of
that
union.
the
basis
of
the
suit
to
originally
found
--
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
jackson
county,
missouri
was
in
essence
that
the
union
had
failed
to
process
the
grievance,
a
grievance
to
arbitration.
the
facts,
i
think,
are
relevantly
simple.
benjamin
owens
who
was
originally
the
plaintiff,
now
deceased,
was
a
worker
in
a
swift
packinghouse
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
the
union
there
is
the
national
brotherhood
of
packinghouse
workers,
an
independent
union.
mr.
owens
had
a
long
history
of
heart
trouble
and
high
blood
pressure.
he
had
been
treated
in
hospitals
since
1956.
in
may
of
1959,
he
felt
so
bad
that
he
felt
he
had
to
take
off
work
and
did
take
off
work.
under
the
contract,
it
was
a
sick
leave
provision.
you
have
to
be
disabled
in
order
to
draw
the
sick
leave.
he
reported
to
the
company
doctor.
the
company
doctor
took
his
blood
pressure
and
he
said,
“you
won’t
hold,
you'll
get
your
sick
leave.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
not
precisely
sure.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
any
case,
he
went
home,
in
fact
went
to
the
hospital,
remained
under
treatment.
he
made
one
effort
to
come
back
to
work.
he
was
then
examined,
the
company
doctor
said
he
was
unfit
to
work.
he
made
a
second
effort
when
his
sick
leave
had
expired,
he
had
6
months,
27
weeks
of
sick
leave
to
come
back
to
work.
the
company
refused
to
permit
him
to
come
back
to
work
and
he
filed
a
grievance
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
union
asked
him
to
produce
doctor's
certificates
saying
he
was
able
to
work
and
he
produced
a
great
number
of
certificates
saying
either
what
his
blood
pressure
was,
reciting
his
blood
pressure
or
reciting
that
he
was
able
to
work.
and
the
union
processed
the
grievance
through
the
four
steps
provided
under
its
collecting
bargaining
agreement
beginning
up
a
foreman's
level
and
working
up
to
the
national
union
level
and
the
company
refused
to
put
him
back
to
work.
now
the
fourth
step
involved
the
national
representatives
of
the
union
and
we
do
have
in
the
record
here
report
of
what
happened
in
the
fourth
step.
the
company
took
the
position
that
it
could
not
in
view
of
its
own
records
as
to
its
previous
history
and
as
to
its
doctor's
report
put
him
back
to
work
simply
on
certificates
saying
mr.
owens
is
able
to
work
or
mr.
owens'
blood
pressure
is
so
and
so.
but
it
would
require
further
evidence.
the
union
then
after
the
fourth
step
making
tried
to
persuade
--
there
was
a
joint
effort
to
try
to
persuade
mr.
owens
to
apply
to
do
other
work
or
to
apply
for
social
security
disability
pension
under
social
security.
he
rejected
that
and
so
the
union
said,
“go
to
your
doctor,
we
will
pay
for
it,
and
get
an
examination,
a
complete
examination
that
will
give
us
the
kind
of
evidence
we
need
to
get
you
back
to
work.”
he
went
to
one
of
the
doctors
who
had
provided
the
certificate.
according
to
his
testimony,
the
doctor
said
he
was
not
equipped
to
give
him
a
complete
physical
examination
of
the
kind
requested
and
referred
him
to
a
heart
specialist.
mr.
owens
went
to
the
heart
specialist,
the
heart
specialist
examined
him,
concluded
that
he
was
totally
unable
to
work;
that
no
employer
could
hire
him
because
the
work
was
compensation
liabilities;
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled
and
eligible
for
the
social
security
sent
such
report
to
the
union.
union
executive
board
met,
decided,
the
motion
was
made
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
nevertheless.
the
union
executive
board
decided
in
the
light
of
this
report,
it
would
not
take
the
case
to
arbitration
but
even
then
did
not
withdraw
the
grievance,
left
it
pending
in
a
hold
status
in
the
event
that
something
later
should
develop
that
would
enable
him
to
get
mr.
owens
back
to
work.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it
was
really
chosen
by
his
own
doctor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
he
went
to
dr.
hesser
and
dr.
hesser
recommended
dr.
day
to
him.
the
union
had
no
choice
in
the
doctor.
the
union
said,
“go
get
a
doctor
and
we
will
pay
the
cost
and
get
us
some
evidence
so
we
can
take
this
case
to
arbitration.”
after
the
union
did
not
take
the
case
to
arbitration,
mr.
owens
then
brought
suit,
he
actually
filed
two
suits.
he
filed
a
suit
against
the
company
claiming
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
he
filed
a
separate
suit
against
the
union
claiming
essentially
the
same
thing,
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
also
claiming
that
the
union
had
wrongfully,
improperly,
arbitrarily
refused
to
take
the
grievance
to
arbitration.
the
case
against
the
company
has
never
been
tried,
still
pending
from
my
stipulation
of
the
parties,
awaiting
result
in
this
case.
the
case
against
the
union
was
tried
to
a
jury.
the
essence,
they
tried
the
merits
of
the
grievance
before
the
jury.
the
testimony
--
there
were
no
medical
testimony.
incidentally,
they've
put
--
the
doctor's
certificates
were
put
into
evidence.
dr.
day's
report
was
put
in
evidence
and
there
was
much
testimony
as
to
the
nature
of
the
kind
of
work
that
mr.
owens
had
done
since
he'd
left
swift
and
how
well
he
felt
and
how
he
played
ball
and
did
a
lot
of
other
things.
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
$7,000
compensatory
damage,
$3,300
punitive
damage
against
the
union.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
and
in
col.
brown
in
the
theory
of
the
suit
was
that
the
union
was
owens'
agent
and
it
had
wrongfully
refused
to
take
his
grievance
to
arbitration.
that's
--
as
--
that's
i
think
the
statement
in
the
complaint.
i
think
that's
the
statement
--
the
question
that
was
given
to
the
jury
by
the
judge's
charge.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
i
think
was
the
--
i
would
characterize
it
that.
i
don't
think
they
–
anybody
used
that
language.
mr.
david
e.
feller
again,
the
answer
is
yes,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out.
no
reference
was
made
to
any
federal
decisions,
any
federal
law
and
col.
brown
here
takes
the
position
that
this
is
a
simple
common
law
principal-agent
relationship
and
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
do
not
know.
i
simply
do
not
know.
in
any
case,
the
jury
entered
the
verdict
then
the
interesting
part
happened.
the
trial
court
set
aside
the
verdict
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
matter
exclusively
for
the
national
relations
board.
owens
then
appealed.
a
few
weeks
after
he
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
before
it
was
argued
in
the
kansas
city
court
of
appeals,
he
died.
he
died
incidentally
precisely
of
the
ailment
that
dr.
day
said
he
would
die
of
if
he
went
back
to
work.
his
administrator
continued
the
appeal.
kansas
city
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
trial
court's
setting
aside
of
the
verdict
on
preemption
grounds
but
referred
it
then
because
there
was
a
dissent
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
reversed,
holding
that
the
matter
was
not
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
precisely
because
there
was
no
claim
and
no
evidence
of
bad
faith
or
discrimination
against
owens.
there
was
no
showing
that
the
union
had
used
--
was
--
wanted
to
get
rid
of
owens
but
it
was
just
simply
a
question
whether
the
grievance
was
a
good
one
and
then
it
passed
to
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict.
it
found
that
there
was
because
there
was
conflict
between
the
medical
certificates
on
one
side
of
the
other
and
sustained
the
judgment,
doing
only
one
thing,
reducing
the
punitive
damages
to
$3,300
because
it
was
more
than
the
addendum
in
the
complaint
to
$3,000.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
this
court
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
a
very
curious
claim
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
i
think
i
have
to
treat
it
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
other
side
and
i
will
just
tell
you
what
mr.
owens
said
on
the
stand.
mr.
owens
said
that
mr.
vaca,
the
president
of
the
local
union,
told
him
that
the
grievance
was
no
good
and
that
the
local
union
didn't
have
any
money.
but
that
if
he
would
pay
$300,
then
certainly
they
would
see
what
they
could
do,
or
they
would
take
it
to
arbitration.
mr.
owens
was
asked
what
was
the
$300
for?
he
said,
“to
pay
the
cost
of
the
arbitration.”
now,
there
was
contrary
testimony,
i
think,
and
the
fair
reading
of
the
record
is
that
what
really
happened
is
what
mr.
jamerson
said
who
had
wanted
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
regard
himself
as
owens'
representative
and
he
said
that
owens
had
come
to
him
and
he
said,
“if
you'll
take
the
case
to
arbitration,
i'll
give
you
$300.”
but
in
any
case
accepting
owens'
statement,
what
vaca
said
to
him
is,
“this
is
a
no
good
grievance
but
if
you're
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
it,
we'll
take
it
to
arbitration.”
and
that's
on
owens'
own
testimony.
he
was
twice
asked
on
this
on
the
record
and
in
both
times
said
that
the
$300
was
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
arbitration.
now
vaca
denied
ever
doing
that,
he
said,
“if
it's
a
good
grievance
we'll
take
it
up,
if
it's
a
bad
grievance
we
wouldn't
take
it
up
and
i
wouldn't
ask
for
the
$300
in
any
case.”
but
a
secong
their
version,
the
plaintiff's
version,
the
only
thing
that
the
union
did
here
was
to
say,
“well,
if
we
--
if
you
want
us
to
take
a
bad
grievance,
which
we
can't
win
the
arbitration,
you
pay
the
cost.”
$300
wouldn't
be
the
cost
of
it
in
any
case.
before
i
finish,
i
--
my
partner
tells
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
he
was
51
at
the
time
of
trial,
mr.
owens
was
51
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question,
i
think,
in
this
case,
most
significant
one,
is
the
nature
and
extent
of
a
union's
responsibility
in
processing
or
refusing
to
process
grievances
under
a
typical
grievance
procedure.
well
let
me
state
at
the
outset
it
is
argued
that
this
is
a
federal
duty
imposed
by
federal
statute
and
governed
by
federal
standards.
section
9
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
“that
if
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
a
collective
bargaining
unit
choose
a
union
as
their
representative,
it
shall
be
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
those
employees
in
dealing
with
matters
with
regards
to
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
and
that
includes
not
only
the
negotiation
of
an
agreement
but
by
the
specific
terms
of
the
statute,
the
processing
of
grievances
under
that
agreement.”
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
of
principal
and
agent,
the
common
law
of
principal
and
agent,
has
nothing
to
do
with
membership,
the
duty
runs
to
all
persons
in
the
bargaining
unit,
members
or
not.
the
authority
which
the
union
is
granted
by
section
9
act,
this
court
has
said,
“imposes
upon
that
union
a
responsibility.”
and
that
responsibility
we
believe
is
a
federal
responsibility,
the
limits
of
that
responsibility
and
the
remedies
where
that
responsibility
is
not
met
are,
we
think,
matters
of
federal
law.
now
that
federal
law
is
suggested
in
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
i
think,
as
this
court,
we
believe,
that
duty
should
be
defined
by
this
court
in
light
of
the
institution
we're
talking
about.
the
grievance
procedures
are
rather
remarkable
institution;
it's
not
explicitly
provided
for
in
any
statute.
it
exists
in
almost
every
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it's
a
uniquely
american
contribution
to
social
institutions
of
this
world.
it
is
a
procedure
by
which
the
union,
acting
for
the
employees,
processes
through
steps
initially
the
employee
initiates
the
grievance,
succeeding
steps
of
the
hierarchy
both
on
the
union
side
and
the
company
side,
complaints
that
the
company
has
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
essential
to
the
operation
of
this
kind
of
procedure
is
the
assumption
which
both
parties
made.
that
the
union
will
act
responsibly
in
administering
its
side
of
the
procedure
and
that
will
in
fact
take
two
arbitration
if
arbitration
is
provided.
and
indeed
will
take
only
to
the
next
step
those
grievances
which
it
finds
are
meritorious.
the
system
could
not
exist,
literally
could
not
exist,
if
the
union
were
obliged,
as
the
agent
of
each
employee,
to
take
each
grievance
irrespective
of
its
use
of
the
merits,
all
the
way
through
the
procedure
and
to
arbitration.
indeed,
i
would
be
less
than
frank
if
i
say
that
the
greatest
problem
faced
by
those
unions
in
administering
a
grievance
procedure
is
the
problem
that
all
of
the
political
push
in
the
other
way,
after
all
the
union
exist
in
the
given
plan
only
if
the
majority
of
the
employees
have
selected
that
union,
they
have
a
right
to
change
it.
the
officers
of
that
union
run
for
election,
required
to
run
for
election,
every
three
years,
the
maximum
period,
under
the
landon
griffin
act.
the
easiest
thing
for
a
union
representative
to
do
when
a
member
comes
to
him
and
says,
“i
have
been
--
company's
violated
the
agreement
in
this
way,
that
way”
is
to
pass
it
on
through
the
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure
and
take
it
to
arbitration
and
if
the
man
losses
it's
just
because
we
had
a
lousy
arbitrator,
“it's
not
my
fault,
vote
for
me
next
time.”
and
in
the
literature
and
as
i
say
in
actual
experience,
the
greatest
problem
is
when
unions
do
not
exercise
their
responsibility
and
do
not
screen
out
the
grievances,
do
not
eliminate
those
which
do
not
present
generally
--
genuinely
meritorious
issues.
if
unions
do
not
do
that,
the
procedure
collapses.
and
the
question
in
this
case
really
then
is,
“does
the
law,
the
federal
law,
governing
the
relationship
provide
that
an
employee
who
is
not
satisfied
with
the
way
the
union
has
handled
it's
grievances,
provided
that
that
employee
can
go
to
court
and
have
a
court
or
a
jury,
under
this
case
a
jury,
express
its
opinions
as
to
the
grievance
and
award
damages
against
the
union?”
if
every
union
have
issued,
must
have
looking
over
its
shoulder,
the
possibility
of
a
court
suit
if
it
decides
that
this
grievance
is
no
good.
then
the
unfortunate
tendency
not
to
swing
grievances
will
be
magnified
a
hundredfold.
and
indeed,
the
short
period
since
this
lawsuit
was
first
decided,
the
people
in
the
business
tell
me
that
they
were
all
--
is
already
on
effect.
now
that
doesn't
mean
of
course
that
the
union
is
free
to
decide
not
take
any
grievance
for
any
reason
or
no
reason.
the
union
is
the
administrating
agents
for
the
employees
in
this
case.
and
the
same
standards
which
this
court
has
laid
down
the
exercise
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
the
negotiation
of
an
agreement,
we
think
apply
to
the
grievance
procedure
in
the
determination
of
the
union
not
to
process
a
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
a
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
not
to
take
a
complaint
to
arbitration
in
this
case.
or
for
that
matter,
i
suppose
this
question
is
the
same,
where
there
is
no
arbitration
at
the
end,
you
know
there
are
a
number
of
industries
in
this
country,
general
electric
placed
in
the
newspapers
most
recently
where
grievances
are
not
ordinarily
arbitratable,
only
discharge
grievances
are
arbitratable
in
general
electric.
other
grievances,
you
go
through
a
procedure.
the
procedure
is
the
same,
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
fourth
step,
whatever
the
numbered
step
is,
and
then
the
union
has
the
option
of
striking
you
or
not.
that's
the
old
fashion
way.
and
i
suppose
the
same
question
would
be
raised
where
the
union
says,
“we
don't
think
this
grievance
is
worth
striking
about.”
there
are
those
who
believe
that
when
the
grievance
procedure
doesn't
work,
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
get
rid
of
this
arbitration
business
because
the
union
keeps
taking
this
frivolous
cases
to
arbitration
and
eliminate
arbitration
and
put
the
strike
provision
in.
but
in
any
case,
it
is
our
view
that
the
federal
duty
is
what
this
court
has
said
that
duty
is.
in
ford
motor
company
against
huffman,
in
humphrey
against
moore,
and
that
is
a
duty
to
do
its
best
in
good
faith,
exercise
its
responsibility
to
all
the
employees
in
handling
the
individual
grievances
of
any
one.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
the
next
question,
your
honor,
assuming
that
that
is
the
duty,
we
have
a
very
difficult
question
as
to
whether
that
duty
is
enforceable
to
the
courts
or
through
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
i've
said
that
this
duty
is
a
federal
duty
imposed
by
section
9
(a)
of
the
act
as
this
court
has
construed
section
9
(a).
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
necessarily
saying
that
a
violation
of
that
duty
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
of
the
act.
the
board
is
given
authority
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practices,
i.e.
violations
of
section
8
of
the
act.
but
not
every
interference
with
the
right
guaranteed
by
section
7
or
the
rights
and
obligations
implicit
in
section
9
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
simplest
case
is
of
course,
when
not
an
employer
but
somebody
else
interferes
with
the
employees
in
engaging
their
right
to
strike
or
a
state
passes
a
law
that
you
can't
strike.
that
law
--
that
impinges
on
rights
protected
by
section
7
but
it's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
question
of
whether
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
not
is
a
much
litigated
one,
the
solicitor
general
has
supplied
a
memorandum
that
it
gave
to
the
court
yesterday,
the
most
recent
decision
on
the
question
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
fifth
circuit,
local
12
of
the
rubber
workers
versus
nlrb
which
sustains
the
board's
present
view,
a
view
which
it
has
adopted
quite
recently.
that
precisely
what
was
involved
here,
the
refusal
to
process
a
grievance
but
in
that
case
found
to
be
for
discriminatory
reasons,
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now
if
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
i
really
express
an
opinion
on
it
and
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
decide
it
in
this
case.
if
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
clearly,
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
believe
it
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
let
me
address
myself
directly
to
that.
the
complaint
against
the
union
for
failing
to
process
a
grievance,
it
is
a
complaint
that
it
has
failed
to
perform
a
duty
imposed
by
the
law
not
by
any
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
know
it's
improper
for
me
to
ask
your
honor
questions
but
i
don't
what
contract
it
can
be
said
the
union
is
violating.
the
employer
has
presumably
in
this
case
violated
a
contract
and
that's
why
the
employee
has
a
complaint,
and
if
he
sues
the
employer
or
if
he
sues
the
employer
and
the
union
jointly,
in
that
lawsuit
is
a
complaint
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
contract.
but
the
question
where
he
sues
the
union,
he
is
suing
it
for
breach
of
its
obligation
to
represent
him.
that
does
not
derive
from
contract;
indeed
it
has
that
same
obligation
to
represent
him
irrespective
of
what
is
in
the
contract
or
indeed,
if
there
is
no
contract
at
all.
it
is
his
agent,
his
representative,
pursuant
to
section
9
(a)
and
therefore
the
duty
which
is
being
enforced
in
our
--
my
view
is
a
duty
imposed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
in
the
section
301
cases,
in
smith
versus
evening
news,
we
have
conduct
a
breach
of
a
contract
which
is
in
violation
allegedly
of
both
a
contractual
obligation
and
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
law,
that
case
of
discriminatory
discharge.
this
court
held
in
smith
versus
evening
news
that
the
fact
if
you
have
violated
the
law
by
the
same
conduct
which
you
have
violated
the
contract
does
not
mean
that
you
cannot
proceed
to
obtain
a
remedy
for
the
violation
of
the
contract.
but
all
that
is
being
sought
for
relief
in
this
case
is
a
violation
of
the
statutory
obligation.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
proper
for
the
employer
to
be
agreeing
as
to
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
let's
throw
those
a
constitution
which
is
dial
--
or
an
agreement
between
the
union
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
alright.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
the
employer
and
union
agree
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
the
employee
would
then
sue
as
kind
of
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
contract
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
well,
i
can
conceive
in
that
case
--
i
will
--
no,
i've
never
seen
such
a
contract.
you
could
argue
that
as
a
third
part
beneficiary,
he
could
sue
and
the
standards
would
then
be
the
contractual
standards.
he
would
be
suing
for
the
violation
of
the
contract
and
it
may
say
imposes
stricter
standard
or
a
looser
standard.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
then
the
standards
in
enforcing
a
contract
would
be
the
same
standards
in
the
law
then
presumably
you
would
be
seeking
to
enforce
the
contract.
but
you
would
not
be
seeking
--
but
in
this
case,
and
in
no
case
that
i
have
ever
heard
of,
are
you
seeking
to
enforce
a
contract?
you
are
seeking
to
enforce
a
duty
defined
by
the
statute
and
bounded
by
the
statute.
now
if
that
duty
is
enforceable
through
the
procedure
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
arguably
so
under
the
government
standard,
then
the
courts
--
there
is
no
situation
except
the
particular
expressed
congressional
provision
in
section
303
of
the
act
that
you
can
also
sue
for
breach
of
secondary
boycott.
there
are
no
other
situations
i
know
in
which
a
duty
imposed
by
the
federal
act
is
enforceable
both
by
the
courts
and
the
national
labor
relations.
now,
if
this
is
and
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
simply
permit
that
question
here
as
you
did
in
the
huffman
case
because
i
think
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
without
dealing
it
with
it
and
i
would
be
embarrassed
to
tell
you
the
truth
if
your
honors
would
say
its
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
here
and
then
got
the
rubber
workers
case
which
petition
for
cert
is
going
to
be
filed
and
then
found
it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
far
flagship
cases,
your
honors
dealt
with
that
very
nicely.
you
had
the
two
cases
together,
the
one
you
said
its
not
enough,
the
labor
act
doesn't
apply
and
therefore
in
the
second
one
you
could
say
it's
no
longer
arguable.
and
unfortunately,
we're
here
before
the
rubber
workers
case
was
here.
now,
i'd
like
if
i
may
your
honors,
just
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
e.
feller
very
briefly,
if
your
honor
may.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
precisely
to
what
counsel
just
referred
to
the
question
of
remedy.
we
dealt
with
it,
i
think
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
and
it
is
our
view
that
wholly
apart
from
the
other
questions
in
this
case
that
the
remedy
in
damages
is
in
any
case
an
inappropriate
remedy.
it
--
because
first
of
all,
it
requires
the
court
to
try
the
merits
of
the
grievance
because
you
can't
find
damages
unless
you
find
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract
as
well
as
a
failure
of
duty
of
representation.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
our
view
is
that
that
is
what
it
should
do
and
if
it
so
found,
should
order
that
the
case
be
then
taken
to
arbitration.
precisely
that
remedy.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
the
damages
would
be
what
the
arbitrator
would
award
under
the
contract
as
the
remedy
for
the
breach.
now
if
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
come
to
that
question
as
i've
said
without
necessarily
involving
the
court
and
the
jury
in
trying
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
and
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
--
let's
take
this
case,
this
discharge
case,
we
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
direct
that
the
case
be
taken
to
arbitration
and
the
union
should
be
responsible
for
any
loss
which
has
been
suffered
by
the
individual
as
a
result
of
its
delay
in
proceeding
to
arbitration
which
is
precisely
the
only
loss
which
he
suffered
if
--
in
the
hypothetical
which
you've
put.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
only
after
arbitration.
i
mean
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
as
essentially
the
union
is
in
a
quasi-governmental
position
here.
it's
like
in
administrative
agency.
let
me
be
perfectly
frank,
it's
got
to
prosecute
on
behalf
of
the
employees
and
it's
a
bipartisan
joint
government
and
i
think
the
remedies
here
are
exactly
the
same
as
they
are
or
very
much
like
when
you
have
a
governmental
agency
which
doesn't
proceed
when
it
should
proceed.
if
an
official
doesn't
proceed
when
he
should,
you
go
into
court
and
require
him
to
proceed.
i
doubt
that
you
--
and
i
find
no
authority
for
inflicting
punitive
damages
or
even
compensatory
damages
upon
the
government
official
when
he
doesn't
do
what
he
should
do
under
the
statute.
mr.
david
e.
feller
they
do
not,
your
honor,
and
that
would
bring
me
exactly
to
the
arbitrary
and
malicious
thing.
the
instruction
which
appears
on
pages
159
to
161
which
is
the
critical
instruction,
i
regret
asking
your
honors
to
look
at
that
because
it's
difficult
to
read.
the
critical
part
of
it
is
quoted
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
its
opinion
on
page
216
of
the
record
and
that
is
the
question
as
each
the
court
says,
the
issue
submitted
to
the
jury
was
whether
the
union
as
plaintiff's
agent
arbitrarily
--
no
malicious
notion,
just
arbitrarily.
if
so
and
without
just
cause
or
excuse,
if
so,
and
thus
with
legal
malice,
if
so,
refuse
to
carry
said
grievance
differences
and
disagreement
through
the
fifth
step.
now
it
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
well
the
problem
in
instruction
number
5
is
it
says
that
acted
reasonably.
instruction
number
6
says
that
it
acted
wrongly
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
or
wrongly,
or
wrongly.
each
of
those
instructions
and
the
arbitrarily
instructions
essentially
permit
the
jury
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
grievance
and
that's
the
only
evidence
which
they
had.
it's
perfectly
clear
on
the
$300.00
incidentally,
the
reference
--
the
jury
was
not
even
given
that
issue.
the
court
in
it's
--
and
i
take
it
under
missouri
law
you
have
to
hypothesize
all
the
facts
in
the
case.
the
court
in
its
instruction
to
the
jury
did
not
require
the
jury
to
find
that
this
$300.00
has
been
testified.
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
no
reference
to
it
at
all
in
instruction
number
2
which
is
the
key
instruction.
the
question
before
the
jury
was
--
very
simply
was,
did
the
union
wrongly,
arbitrarily,
unreasonably
refused
to
process
this
grievance
and
what
they
tried
to
the
jury
to
come
to
the
answer
to
that
is
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
and
indeed,
as
i
say
the
missouri
supreme
court
expressly
said
there
was
no
discrimination,
none
of
this
business
about
we
don't
like
your
conduct
in
the
union
hall
because
they
said
that
if
it
did,
that
would
be
unfair
labor
practice
and
we
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
so
we
have
jurisdiction
only
because
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
conduct
here.
and
so
essentially,
of
course,
i
said
the
constructions
are
wrong
even
if
the
instructions
were
right.
i
think
there's
some
minimum
quantum
of
evidence
as
to
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
which
have
been
required
and
the
plaintiff
produced
none
here
and
the
defendant
rebutted
whatever
inference
could
be
brought
in
the
plaintiff's
testimony
as
to
precisely
the
reason
union
acted.
it
acted
after
it
got
dr.
day's
report
and
dr.
day's
report
said
this
man
is
unemployable.
thank
you
your
honors.
