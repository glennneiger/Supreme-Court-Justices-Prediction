justice

j.
brennan,

but
suppose,
mr.
feller,
the
contract
--
i
remember
seeing
one,
but
suppose
it
had
a
provision,
the
agreement
of
course
with
the
employer
and
the
union
undertakes
in
good
faith
to
represent
the
employee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
might.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
mine
first.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
suppose
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
which
that
appeared.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
never
seen
one
but
it's
not
impossible
there
could
be
a
--
such
a
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
union
shall
in
good
faith
represent
the
employees
in
the
administration
of
this
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
let's
make
it
easier.
and
the
union
undertakes
to
represent
the
employees
in
the
administration
of
this
contract
in
all
respects
consistent
with
the
obligation
under
the
national
labor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
“lug”
then
synonymous
with
a
bribe
or
a
pay
off
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
sort
of
a
tort
concept?
is
that
a
tort
concept,
arbitrary,
malicious
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
would
you
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
didn't
you
sue
the
employer?
i
suppose
that
--
have
you
got
an
action
going
against
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
if
you
say
the
breach
of
the
duty
is
a
failure
to
take
the
claim
to
arbitration.
the
claim
in
arbitration
is
essentially
that
the
employers
breached
this
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
employer
didn't
breach
his
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
employer
did
not
breach
his
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
in
the
arbitration,
the
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
employer
would
say
to
you
in
his
court
suit,
“you
haven't
taken
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
arbitration
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
said
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
if
you
--
i
gather
you
take
it
then
that
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
their
representation
can
be
--
can
occur
without
there
being
any
collusion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
it
takes
only
arbitrary
action,
doesn't
take
any
dishonesty
or
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
don't
--
apparently,
you
don't
think
federal
law
covers
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
federal
--
what
if
the
federal
law
was
at
least
say
in
this
court
some
other
courts
that
to
breach
that
duty
requires
some
degree
of
dishonesty
or
bad
faith,
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
degree
of
dishonesty
or
bad
faith
and
the
state
law
was
to
the
contrary,
they
didn't
--
they
only
took
arbitrary
action
which
--
do
you
suppose
a
federal
law
would
govern,
as
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
--
so
the
federal
--
we
don't
--
you
do
not
resist
the
federal
laws
governing
in
this
case,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you're
arguing,
mr.
browne,
that
we
are
to
have
a
federal
rule
that
the
federal
rule
ought
to
be
that
there
is
liability
for
arbitrary
malicious
failure
to
carry
out
one's
duty
of
representation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
you'd
argue
secondly
that
if
we're
going
to
do
that
as
we
did
in
lynn
with
libel
state
--
libel
actions
against
lynn,
that's
--
you're
to
allow
a
state
forum
for
it.
