mr.
scott,
in
texas
if
a
defendant
takes
a
stand
may
he
be
examined
on
his
part
criminal
records
in
the
future
--
justice
william
j.

purposes?
well
what
effect
on
that
practice
did
the
rule
you
asked
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
rule
you're
asking
us
to
announce,
the
constitutional
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
in
the
circumstances
cross-examination,
would
not
the
constitutional
similarly
bar
question
to
that
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
waiver
concept?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
--
i
could
see
that
if
these
were
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
problem
but
i
gather
that
is
not
your
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
suppose
mr.
attorney
general,
naturally
a
problem
whether
if
we
agreed
with
mr.
scott
that
this
is
a
constitutional
principle
we
should
make
it
retroactive
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
that
happen,
mr.
phillips,
i
take
it
then
on
a
verdict
of
guilty
the
jury
knowing
nothing
about
this
automatically
the
40-year
penalty
would
follow,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
jury
here
has
not
--
heard
nothing
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it's
only
that
where
he
denies
and
makes
an
issue
of
fact
of
the
allegations
of
that
count
that
the
jury
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
if
he
admits
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
he
doesn't
admit
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
led
to
the
jury
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
evidence
presented
in
support
of
the
allegation
of
that
second
count.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
jury
mr.
phillips?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
for
what
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly,
is
to
admit
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
relevant
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
does
in
--
really
does
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
that
truly
bear
on
credibility
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
mere
fact
that
it
happen
20
years
ago
may
have
committed
another
robbery
to
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
is
not
when
if
he
takes
the
stand
that
he
is
not
to
be
believed
in
his
version
of
the
events
to
these
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
phillips
statistics
on
this
may
not
be
available
but
i
was
just
wondering
how
often
do
defendants
deny
identity
under
the
old
procedure
and
require
this
to
be
tried
out?
it
happened
often?
