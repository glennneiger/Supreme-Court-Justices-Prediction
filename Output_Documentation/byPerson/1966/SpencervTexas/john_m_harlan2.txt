justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
just
ask
one
more
question
on
that
line?
it
doesn't
apply
directly
to
our
case
but
before
january
1,
1966,
in
non-capital
case
such
as
we
have
in
bell,
can
a
defendant,
by
admitting
his
prior
conviction,
prevent
the
jury
from
getting
the
hearing
indictment
and
getting
information
that
he
is
a
former
convict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
do
we
have
to
assume
in
deciding
the
bell
case
that
it
is
possible
for
the
prosecution,
regardless
of
the
admission
of
the
prior
convictions
to
give
to
the
jury
the
charge
that
you
got
us
to
as
to
those
priors?
justice
john
m.
harlan
within
the
question
of
requiring,
that's
a
question
of
permitting
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
are
we
to
consider
the
texas
law
as
our
–
in
state
matters
where
we're
suppose
to
accept
the
law
of
the
state
as
interpreted,
what
are
we
going
to
accept?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
read
it,
it
seems
to
me.
