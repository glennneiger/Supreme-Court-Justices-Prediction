mr.
hawthorne
phillips
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
scott
advice
here
that
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
follow
this
particular
procedure
that
was
used
by
texas
and
is
now
no
longer
used.
i
am
not
here
to
of
course
argue
to
this
court
which
is
the
fair
procedure.
the
legislature
has
determined
the
procedure
that
they
want
to
follow
in
the
future.
question
before
this
court
certainly
again
is
not
quite
that
this
old
procedure
is
better
than
the
new
but
whether
or
not
it's
constitutionally
impermissible.
we
do
not
have
figures
as
to
the
number
of
people
or
number
of
those
in
confinement
throughout
the
united
states
that
might
be
affected
by
your
decision.
texas
keeps
only
information
as
far
as
the
state
of
texas
is
concerned
as
to
those
who
have
the
received
the
life
sentence
and
there
are
some
537
of
those
in
the
state
of
texas
or
where
at
first
of
the
year.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
i
am
bringing
that
out
for
that
particular
reasoning.
of
course
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright
sir
the
provision
of
the
penal
code,
article
62
has
not
been
changed.
it
provides
of
course
for
an
enhancement
of
punishment
for
a
like
offense.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
for
a
like
offense.
that's
the
situation
in
bell.
in
case
is
proof
of
a
life
offense,
a
second,
the
second
offense
of
a
like
crime
then
it's
mandatory
that
the
maximum
set
up
our
statute
for
that
particular
crime
be
awarded
as
a
sentence.
a
prior
procedure
provided
at
the
matter
of
the
included
in
the
indictment,
the
prior
offense
is
a
separate
count
in
spite
of
course
the
original
offense
on
which
he's
now
charged
than
in
the
second
offense.
the
jury
was
charged
not
only
with
determining
guilt
or
innocence
but
was
charged
to
the
duty
of
assessing
the
punishment.
there
was
only
one
hearing.
there
was
no
provision
under
the
law
for
a
separate
hearing.
nothing
like
we
have
in
federal
courts
on
a
presentence
investigation
and
then
a
man
coming
back
end
of
the
sentence.
it
all
had
to
be
done
by
the
jury
in
one
procedure.
now
under
the
present
amendment
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
would
not
be
given
to
the
jury
because
it
would
no
longer
be
relevant.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
sir.
he
would
not
plead
guilty
at
the
second
offense
or
up
to
the
previous
offenses
because
it's
a
procedural
matter.
it
does
not
create
a
new
offense.
he
would
be
merely
admitting
to
identity
that
i
am
the
same
man
who
was
charged.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
that
is
the
maximum
for
the
(voice
overlap)
crime.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
jury
would
hear
nothing
of
it.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
sir.
he
has
injected
the
issue
by
refusing
to
admit
it
down.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it's
never
given
by
the
jury.
it's
not
evidence
the
court
instructs
the
jury
that
the
rating
of
the
indictment
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
in
its
entirety
if
the
question
of
identity
has
(voice
overlap).
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
on
the
second
count
which
would
be
as
to
the
prior
offenses
would
not
be
read.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
admits
it.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
doesn't
admit
it
then
the
entire
indictment.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
and
then
evidence
presented.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright
in
every
case
except
the
capital
case,
in
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
that's
held,
that
there
has
been
no
changes
as
far
as
capital
cases
are
concerned.
but
in
the
other
case,
the
indictment
is
now
read
under
the
first
count
to
the
jury.
the
second
count
containing
the
prior
offense
is
not
read
until
after
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
the
jury.
then
under
our
present
statute,
it
is
provided
that
at
that
time,
the
defendant
has
the
right
elect
whether
or
not
the
jury
will
assess
punishment
or
whether
or
not
the
court
without
a
jury
will
assess
punishment.
at
this
particular
time,
after
the
election
by
the
defendant,
then
the
matter
of
the
second
count
has
brought
it.
if
it's
the
hearing
before
a
jury
that
the
count
is
read
in
the
jury
and
evidence
is
not
introduced.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
same
jury.
if
before
the
court,
of
course
i
am
sure
the
court
has
already
seen
the
indictment
not
having
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
then
evidence
is
presented
before
the
court.
i
do
not
--
of
course
the
man
would
be
--
could
admit
at
the
time
and
it
will
no
longer
be
an
issue.
we
do
not
have
a
procedure
like
you
set
out
under
your
federal
narcotics
cases
where
the
court
questions
the
individual
concerning
his
identity
and
connection
with
the
fast
crime.
it
is
a
matter
still
in
fact
questioned
for
determination
unless
he
admits
it.
now,
i
don't
personally
would
not
feel
that
the
blanket
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
protecting
that
on
a
procedural
matter.
however,
the
courts
have
not
done
so
far
nor
has
our
legislature
can
align
the
defendant
could
be
placed
on
the
witness
stand
in
question
about
the
offense
or
the
previous
offenses
unless
they
voluntarily
wish
as
to
take
the
stand.
now,
certainly
i
think
that
here,
we
have
a
question
of
rules
of
evidence
and
i
think
the
court
is
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
rules
of
evidence
sometimes
the
court
is
quite
cumbersome.
they
are
designed,
i
think
we
all
admit
to
try
ensure
a
fair
trial
and
to
almost
every
rule
that
i
know
of
prohibiting
certain
types
of
evidence
except
some
to
have
a
risk.
take
to
his
favor
as
to
some
exceptions
to
the
hearsay.
i
think
the
rule
concerning
the
admission
of
the
character
of
the
defendant.
this
is
an
evidentiary
rule,
trying
again
to
ensure
a
fair
trial.
he
submitted
that
there
are
quite
a
number
of
exceptions
in
this
particular
instance
and
one
of
those
has
been
or
several
had
been
mentioned
previously
to
this
court
when
the
defendant
takes
the
stand.
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence,
the
effect
of
his
prior
convictions
or
even
prior
reputation
might
definitely
affect
his
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
finding
of
the
jury
concerning
guilt
or
innocence
i
should
say
but
still
it
submitted.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
to
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
to
the
offense
himself.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
then
you
have
as
much
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
to
some
extent
whether
or
not
the
man
is
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
goes
to
remote
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
depends
on
our
remote
the
crime
has
actually.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
know
that
has
occurred
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
probably
under
michelson
now
that
it
would
be
held
to
be
possibly
by
this
court
if
it
present
it
to
be
constitutionally
impermissible
to
go
into
that.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
michelson
case
has
discussed
the
fact
of
injection
of
character
in
the
trial.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
general
character
of
the
witness
and
certainly
the
lawlessness
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
black
that
the
character
of
the
witness
can
be
admitted
at
all
unless
the
character
is
in
some
manner
put
in
the
issue.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
michelson?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
yes
sir
by
this
court.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
we
do
have
the
exceptions
at
wigmore,
the
fact
that
character
generally
can't
be
put
in
there
except
for
these
various
things
we've
been
discussing.
one
of
which
he
says.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
the
constitutional
rule.
this
court
has
not
written
the
constitutional
rules
on
admissions
of
evidence
nor
the
constitution
specify
admissions
of
evidence.
constitution
only
hopes
and
guarantees
that
an
individual
will
be
given
a
fair
trial.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct
but
i'm
talking
about
due
process.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
now,
certainly
there
is
very
good
reason
just
as
there
is
reason
to
say
in
such
crimes
to
show
previous
sex
offenses,
where
the
issue
of
character
is
actually
in
the
trial.
it
then
becomes
relevant
to
that
particular
case.
it's
relevant
in
this
type
of
case
because
the
defendant
by
failing
or
refusing
to
admit
identity
that
puts
his
character
an
issue
before
the
jury.
now
i
can't
believe
that
under
federal
practice
where
your
rules
allow
and
particularly
have
noticed
in
narcotics
cases
over
200
similar
offenses
to
be
set
out
in
one
single
day
and
tried
at
one
time
or
where
under
some
of
the
cases
on
pornography
where
this
court
decided
recently
there
were
numerous
counts
in
the
indictment.
something
that
had
occurred
fairly
recent
that
that
is
not
informing
the
jury
of
the
character
of
the
defendant
and
that
they
would
be
much
more
likely
to
say
that,
here
is
a
man
of
bad
character
than
they
would
say,
the
same
thing
based
on
one
remote
offense.
i
leave
that
to
you
but
i
do
want
to
state
that
this
exact
practice
is
not
unknown
to
federal
practice
under
the
national
provision
act
where
a
procedure
was
not
specified,
and
you
had
an
enhancement
procedure.
federal
courts
uniformly
held
that
at
that
particular
time
there
are
circuit
court
cases
that
it
was
a
proper
procedure,
tried
both
for
substance
and
offense
and
the
question
of
identity
in
the
existence
of
prior
offenses
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
trial
and
read
to
the
jury
the
indictment
containing
these
as
prior
to
determination
of
guilt.
there
has
been
quite
a
reveal
of
the
cases
or
the
prior
cases
in
that
regard
in
massey
versus
united
states
281
f.293
and
that
was
carried
on
forward
as
long
as
the
national
provision
act
was
in
existence.
of
course
enhancement
under
narcotics
act
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
now,
the
procedure
is
said.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
the
supplemental
brief
we
filed
an
answer
to
the
reply
brief
filed
by
petitioner.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
didn't
read
them
that
way.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
my
impression
to
these
cases
were
that
they
did
provide
for
enhanced
punishment
for
greater
punishment.
he
did
not
have
a
different
crime
just
as
we
do
not
have
a
different
crime
under
texas
state.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
would
not.
we
do
have
the
same
situation
on
driving
while
intoxicated
and
driving
while
intoxicated
second
offense
and
i
think
under
the
national
firearms
act
you
have
transportation
across
the
state
line
of
a
firearms
by
a
person
who
has
been
previously
convicted,
but
that
is
not
in
this
case.
this
court
also
has
recognized
in
the
past
that
it
was
a
common
practice
to
handle
these
cases
in
this
time.
and
again
i
call
the
court's
attention
on
the
supplemental
brief
in
brown
versus
west
virginia
when
mr.
justice
hughes
stated
it
was
a
familiar
practice
to
set
forth
in
the
indictment
the
fact
of
the
prior
conviction
and
submit
to
the
jury
the
evidence
upon
that
issue
together
without
relating
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
on
which
the
indictment
charge.
and
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
in
1954
in
chandler
versus
fretag,
made
a
summary
statement
that
while
this
could
be
a
separate
issue
and
could
be
tried
separately,
that
it
was
common
practice
to
try
it
in
this
manner.
again,
mr.
justice
clark
in
oyler
versus
boles
and
crabtree
versus
boles
made
the
same
statement
referring
back
in
that
instance
that
authority
to
chandler
versus
fretag.
so
it's
a
practice
that
has
been
followed
and
while
not
this
question
was
not
before
the
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
practice
certainly
test
the
approval
was
given
by
this
court
in
stating
this
is
a
practice
that
may
followed.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
west
--
graham
versus
west
virginia.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
contains
that
language
and
you
said
it
in
graham
versus
west
virginia
also.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
a
little
farther
that
in
this
particular
case
i
think
the
facts
of
the
case
itself
come
within
the
rule
that
even
though
harsh
as
it
may
be
that
this
court
set
out
in
fay
versus
connecticut
and
that
is
that
it
must
--
that
there
cannot
be
any
reasonable
probability
that
the
evidence
in
question
affected
the
verdict
to
the
jury.
now,
in
this
case
i
don't
think
that
a
jury
of
12
reasonable
men
could
have
reached
any
other
conclusion
where
a
man
robbed
the
store.
he
left
the
store
manager
and
the
assistant
in
the
vault.
he
had
held
them
up
with
a
gold-plated
pistol.
he
forced
them
to
put
money
in
a
bag
that
had
the
store
marking
on
it.
they
were
able
to
secure
their
release
from
the
vault
because
it
had
a
provision
where
it
could
always
be
opened
from
the
inside,
they
called
the
authorities.
the
highway
patrol,
among
other
law
enforcement
officers
were
notified.
the
officers
were
starting
to
set
up
a
roadblock.
they
then
noticed
a
car
that
approached
and
then
made
a
u-turn.
they
gave
pursuit.
the
car
violated
the
speed
limit.
they
stopped
the
car
and
in
result
in
action
in
giving
a
ticket.
one
of
the
officers
looked
in
the
car
and
saw
the
gold-plated
pistol
on
the
seat.
they
went
through
the
car,
they
found
the
money
bag
where
the
money,
the
change
still
in
them
and
the
bills
under
the
seat.
the
store
manager
then
identified
the
defendant.
he
identified
the
money
bags,
the
amount
taken
corresponded
with
the
amount
that
had
been
taken
from
the
store.
there
was
a
case
of
actual
identity
and
arrest
just
a
very
short
time
after
the
crime
and
the
proceeds
of
the
crime
in
the
possession
of
the
individual.
there
was
no
rebuttal
evidence
offered
whatsoever
to
explain
these
facts
nor
did
the
defendant
take
a
stand
in
an
attempt
to
explain.
now,
the
only
evidence
that
was
offered
in
his
defense
was
by
his
mother
who
said
that
she
believed
that
he
must
be
insane
if
he
did
it
that
he
had
had
a
head
injury
and
that
she
had
noticed
that
he
had
acted
peculiarly.
and
that
he
had
him
treated
or
attempted
to
have
him
treated
in
a
mental
institution.
there
was
rebuttal
evidence
in
the
issue
of
insanity.
it's
not
--
it
was
given
to
the
jury
decided
against
the
defendant
and
is
not
a
part
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
only
question
is
under
the
rulings
then
in
fay
versus
connecticut
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
this
evidence
by
the
inclusion,
should
it
be
constitutionally
impermissible
which
we
still
deny
and
whether
or
not
any
jury
of
12
unbiased
persons
would
have
reached
a
different
verdict
and
i
do
--
i
present
to
the
court
that
in
examining
this
record.
now
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
which
is
included
in
the
record
details
this
evidence.
these
facts
have
not
been
denied
and
in
fact
counsel
admitted
that
the
statement
was
fair.
we
did
not
reproduce
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
this
court
has
asked.
you
of
course
have
the
original
transcript
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
one
copy.
we
reproduced
a
remainder
of
the
evidence
of
the
court,
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
if
they
want
to
examine
the
acts
of
facts
rather
than
take
word
of
counsel
both
of
us
feel
though
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
fairly
sets
this
matter
out.
if
you
wish
it
in
entirety
we
have
it
in,
we'll
be
glad
to
leave
it
with
the
clerks
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
now,
i
do
think
that
this
court
certainly
is
designed
to
protect
the
individual.
it
was
created
for
that
purpose.
our
very
constitution
gives
it
that
duty
but
also
there
is
a
duty
to
society
and
the
individual
is
protected
because
he's
a
member
of
that
society.
in
facts
as
we
have
in
this
type
of
case,
i
think
this
court
would
be
doing
a
great
service
to
society
to
establish
a
rule
that
would
release
these
people
who
to
say
the
least
that
has
shown
that
they
are
not
quite
adjusted
to
live
in
a
social
society.
for
all
laws
are
liberal,
that
of
course
would
not
waive
any
question
of
constitutionality,
as
i
grant
you
that.
but
i
do
urge
the
court
to
carefully
consider
this
record
and
the
facts
of
this
case
as
well
as
the
facts
that
the
defendant
by
his
own
acts
in
refusing
to
admit
identity
as
a
procedural
matter
not
as
an
element
of
crime
injected
into
this
case
the
question
of
which
he
now
complains.
thank
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
you're
asking
if
the
alleged
prior
convictions
then
do
not
prove?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
but
he
was
found
guilty
of
first
offense.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
think
there
again
it
was
an
issue
and
the
jury
would
be
more
likely
to
not
believe
the
state
if
they
could
not
prove
all
of
their
indictment
even
though
if
they
had
--
if
they
failed
in
proof
here
of
that
regard
certainly
the
jury
would
be
finding
it's
nothing
to
it.
this
man
was
a
good
character
at
that
time.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
thank
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
would
by
admitting
that
his
identity
as
being
the
same
person
charged
and
convicted
of
the
prior
offenses.
if
he
had
made
that
admission
then
that
evidence
could
not
or
the
charge
in
the
indictment
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
jury
nor
could
have
evidence
it's
been
presented.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
under
texas
procedures,
there
are
number
of
them
saying.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
old
procedure.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
mr.
justice
white
under
the
ground
that
the
defendant
has
injected
this
element
into
a
case
by
not
admitting
his
identity.
certainly,
it
was
a
procedure
that
has
been
filed
in
texas
since
1853
and
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
if
possibly
that
this
court
if
i
presented
to
them
with
a
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
legislature
has
the
power
to
pass
statute
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
that
under
the
decisions,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
interpretation
given
to
the
constitution
by
this
court.
or
the
statute
can
be
given
fact.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
yes.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
on
the
grounds
that
as
set
out
in
michelson.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
see
but
it
would
be
applied
i
believe
it's
correct
to
state
procedure
now.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
have
held
that
it
would
extend
the
question
of
procedural
due
process
to
state
cases.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
might
be
--
i
might
been
here
as
to
particular
case
but
i
was
–
it
is
my
impression
that
it
was
in
michelson.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it's
a
question
--
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
admission
of
character
evidence.
and
it
is
impermissible
i
would
think
in
federal
court
under
the
interpretations
we
submitted
this
court
has
made
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
would
extend
the
state
practice.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
well
you
have
held
a
number
of
state
laws
in
the
application
to
be
unconstitutional.
for
example
the
denial
of
counsel.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
also,
mr.
justice
black,
under
the
question
of
due
process
whether
or
not
the
man
received
a
fair
trial.
i
am
thinking
about
say
possibly
under
the
riddo
(ph)
case
where
the
confession
with
broadcast
or
the
turner
case
where
the
deputy
sheriff
had
jury
to
mind.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
the
question
of
character
injection
of
character
into
the
trial
where
it
is
not
relevant
then
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
an
impartial
jury
from
the
time
that
that
element
is
undertaken.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
certain
type
of
crimes
under
again
i
think
our
preponderance
rules
of
evidence
as
i
have
seen
them
(inaudible).
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
that
your
answer
in
that
in
my
impression
is
in
line
with
what
mr.
justice
black
was
asking.
i
think
that
the
man
is
being
denied
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
tribunal
by
slipping
those
matters
to
a
jury
they
could
not
be
entered
to
as
an
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
trial.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
feel
that
possibly
they
were
going
a
little
too
far
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
think
that
it
would
go
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
of
impartiality
of
the
jury
that
that
would
be
say
--
shall
we
say
stretching
the
rules
of
evidence
to
such
an
extent.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
go
back
to
the
premise
again
that
it
is
very
relevant
to
the
sentence
itself
and
has
been
injected
by
the
defense.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
jury
sentence
is
in
texas.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
under
the
former
procedure
that
was
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
done.
there
were
no
other
provisions
by
law.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
has
been
changed
now.
whether
the
legislature
says
the
present
method
is
better
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
some
places
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
capital
case,
you're
right
mr.
justice
clark.
they
still
use
the
old
procedure
in
the
capital
case.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
only
in
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it's
not
--
it
was
not
permitted
and
it's
still
not
permitted.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
all
because
the
jury
had
the
sentence.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
admitted
it
out.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
they
were
not
suppose
as
to
whether
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
on
some
of
the
cases
they
did.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
fix
the
sentence
except
under
the
enhancement
statutes.
automatically
it
becomes
a
question
of
law
on
page
62
and
page
63
cases.
because
if
the
jury
finds
or
if
the
man
admits
the
prior
offenses
then
as
a
matter
of
law
his
sentences
shall
be
like
under
63
cases
and
shall
be
the
maximum
allowed
under
62
cases.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
need
not,
if
it
did
it
will
lead
grounds
for
reversal.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
to
determine
--
the
way
i
understand
the
interpretation
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
stated
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
but
they
could
avoid,
there
are
number
of
cases
which
say
that
they
can
avoid
the
injection
of
this
issue
before
the
jury
by
admitting
that.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
all
i
can
answer
in
that
regard
is
that
since
the
sentence
becomes
important
a
matter
of
law
if
that
provision
is
not
necessary
in
the
charge.
i
would
have
--
it
would
be
my
question
if
it
were
included
in
the
charge
in
saying
that
they
are
--
that
the
court
would
reverse
it.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
thank
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
scott
advice
here
that
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
follow
this
particular
procedure
that
was
used
by
texas
and
is
now
no
longer
used.
i
am
not
here
to
of
course
argue
to
this
court
which
is
the
fair
procedure.
the
legislature
has
determined
the
procedure
that
they
want
to
follow
in
the
future.
question
before
this
court
certainly
again
is
not
quite
that
this
old
procedure
is
better
than
the
new
but
whether
or
not
it's
constitutionally
impermissible.
we
do
not
have
figures
as
to
the
number
of
people
or
number
of
those
in
confinement
throughout
the
united
states
that
might
be
affected
by
your
decision.
texas
keeps
only
information
as
far
as
the
state
of
texas
is
concerned
as
to
those
who
have
the
received
the
life
sentence
and
there
are
some
537
of
those
in
the
state
of
texas
or
where
at
first
of
the
year.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
i
am
bringing
that
out
for
that
particular
reasoning.
of
course
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright
sir
the
provision
of
the
penal
code,
article
62
has
not
been
changed.
it
provides
of
course
for
an
enhancement
of
punishment
for
a
like
offense.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
for
a
like
offense.
that's
the
situation
in
bell.
in
case
is
proof
of
a
life
offense,
a
second,
the
second
offense
of
a
like
crime
then
it's
mandatory
that
the
maximum
set
up
our
statute
for
that
particular
crime
be
awarded
as
a
sentence.
a
prior
procedure
provided
at
the
matter
of
the
included
in
the
indictment,
the
prior
offense
is
a
separate
count
in
spite
of
course
the
original
offense
on
which
he's
now
charged
than
in
the
second
offense.
the
jury
was
charged
not
only
with
determining
guilt
or
innocence
but
was
charged
to
the
duty
of
assessing
the
punishment.
there
was
only
one
hearing.
there
was
no
provision
under
the
law
for
a
separate
hearing.
nothing
like
we
have
in
federal
courts
on
a
presentence
investigation
and
then
a
man
coming
back
end
of
the
sentence.
it
all
had
to
be
done
by
the
jury
in
one
procedure.
now
under
the
present
amendment
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
would
not
be
given
to
the
jury
because
it
would
no
longer
be
relevant.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
sir.
he
would
not
plead
guilty
at
the
second
offense
or
up
to
the
previous
offenses
because
it's
a
procedural
matter.
it
does
not
create
a
new
offense.
he
would
be
merely
admitting
to
identity
that
i
am
the
same
man
who
was
charged.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
that
is
the
maximum
for
the
(voice
overlap)
crime.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
jury
would
hear
nothing
of
it.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
sir.
he
has
injected
the
issue
by
refusing
to
admit
it
down.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it's
never
given
by
the
jury.
it's
not
evidence
the
court
instructs
the
jury
that
the
rating
of
the
indictment
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
in
its
entirety
if
the
question
of
identity
has
(voice
overlap).
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
on
the
second
count
which
would
be
as
to
the
prior
offenses
would
not
be
read.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
admits
it.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
doesn't
admit
it
then
the
entire
indictment.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
and
then
evidence
presented.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright
in
every
case
except
the
capital
case,
in
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
that's
held,
that
there
has
been
no
changes
as
far
as
capital
cases
are
concerned.
but
in
the
other
case,
the
indictment
is
now
read
under
the
first
count
to
the
jury.
the
second
count
containing
the
prior
offense
is
not
read
until
after
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
the
jury.
then
under
our
present
statute,
it
is
provided
that
at
that
time,
the
defendant
has
the
right
elect
whether
or
not
the
jury
will
assess
punishment
or
whether
or
not
the
court
without
a
jury
will
assess
punishment.
at
this
particular
time,
after
the
election
by
the
defendant,
then
the
matter
of
the
second
count
has
brought
it.
if
it's
the
hearing
before
a
jury
that
the
count
is
read
in
the
jury
and
evidence
is
not
introduced.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
same
jury.
if
before
the
court,
of
course
i
am
sure
the
court
has
already
seen
the
indictment
not
having
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
then
evidence
is
presented
before
the
court.
i
do
not
--
of
course
the
man
would
be
--
could
admit
at
the
time
and
it
will
no
longer
be
an
issue.
we
do
not
have
a
procedure
like
you
set
out
under
your
federal
narcotics
cases
where
the
court
questions
the
individual
concerning
his
identity
and
connection
with
the
fast
crime.
it
is
a
matter
still
in
fact
questioned
for
determination
unless
he
admits
it.
now,
i
don't
personally
would
not
feel
that
the
blanket
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
protecting
that
on
a
procedural
matter.
however,
the
courts
have
not
done
so
far
nor
has
our
legislature
can
align
the
defendant
could
be
placed
on
the
witness
stand
in
question
about
the
offense
or
the
previous
offenses
unless
they
voluntarily
wish
as
to
take
the
stand.
now,
certainly
i
think
that
here,
we
have
a
question
of
rules
of
evidence
and
i
think
the
court
is
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
rules
of
evidence
sometimes
the
court
is
quite
cumbersome.
they
are
designed,
i
think
we
all
admit
to
try
ensure
a
fair
trial
and
to
almost
every
rule
that
i
know
of
prohibiting
certain
types
of
evidence
except
some
to
have
a
risk.
take
to
his
favor
as
to
some
exceptions
to
the
hearsay.
i
think
the
rule
concerning
the
admission
of
the
character
of
the
defendant.
this
is
an
evidentiary
rule,
trying
again
to
ensure
a
fair
trial.
he
submitted
that
there
are
quite
a
number
of
exceptions
in
this
particular
instance
and
one
of
those
has
been
or
several
had
been
mentioned
previously
to
this
court
when
the
defendant
takes
the
stand.
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence,
the
effect
of
his
prior
convictions
or
even
prior
reputation
might
definitely
affect
his
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
finding
of
the
jury
concerning
guilt
or
innocence
i
should
say
but
still
it
submitted.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
to
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
to
the
offense
himself.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
then
you
have
as
much
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
to
some
extent
whether
or
not
the
man
is
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
goes
to
remote
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
depends
on
our
remote
the
crime
has
actually.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
know
that
has
occurred
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
probably
under
michelson
now
that
it
would
be
held
to
be
possibly
by
this
court
if
it
present
it
to
be
constitutionally
impermissible
to
go
into
that.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
michelson
case
has
discussed
the
fact
of
injection
of
character
in
the
trial.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
general
character
of
the
witness
and
certainly
the
lawlessness
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
black
that
the
character
of
the
witness
can
be
admitted
at
all
unless
the
character
is
in
some
manner
put
in
the
issue.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
michelson?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
yes
sir
by
this
court.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
we
do
have
the
exceptions
at
wigmore,
the
fact
that
character
generally
can't
be
put
in
there
except
for
these
various
things
we've
been
discussing.
one
of
which
he
says.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
the
constitutional
rule.
this
court
has
not
written
the
constitutional
rules
on
admissions
of
evidence
nor
the
constitution
specify
admissions
of
evidence.
constitution
only
hopes
and
guarantees
that
an
individual
will
be
given
a
fair
trial.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct
but
i'm
talking
about
due
process.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
now,
certainly
there
is
very
good
reason
just
as
there
is
reason
to
say
in
such
crimes
to
show
previous
sex
offenses,
where
the
issue
of
character
is
actually
in
the
trial.
it
then
becomes
relevant
to
that
particular
case.
it's
relevant
in
this
type
of
case
because
the
defendant
by
failing
or
refusing
to
admit
identity
that
puts
his
character
an
issue
before
the
jury.
now
i
can't
believe
that
under
federal
practice
where
your
rules
allow
and
particularly
have
noticed
in
narcotics
cases
over
200
similar
offenses
to
be
set
out
in
one
single
day
and
tried
at
one
time
or
where
under
some
of
the
cases
on
pornography
where
this
court
decided
recently
there
were
numerous
counts
in
the
indictment.
something
that
had
occurred
fairly
recent
that
that
is
not
informing
the
jury
of
the
character
of
the
defendant
and
that
they
would
be
much
more
likely
to
say
that,
here
is
a
man
of
bad
character
than
they
would
say,
the
same
thing
based
on
one
remote
offense.
i
leave
that
to
you
but
i
do
want
to
state
that
this
exact
practice
is
not
unknown
to
federal
practice
under
the
national
provision
act
where
a
procedure
was
not
specified,
and
you
had
an
enhancement
procedure.
federal
courts
uniformly
held
that
at
that
particular
time
there
are
circuit
court
cases
that
it
was
a
proper
procedure,
tried
both
for
substance
and
offense
and
the
question
of
identity
in
the
existence
of
prior
offenses
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
trial
and
read
to
the
jury
the
indictment
containing
these
as
prior
to
determination
of
guilt.
there
has
been
quite
a
reveal
of
the
cases
or
the
prior
cases
in
that
regard
in
massey
versus
united
states
281
f.293
and
that
was
carried
on
forward
as
long
as
the
national
provision
act
was
in
existence.
of
course
enhancement
under
narcotics
act
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
now,
the
procedure
is
said.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
the
supplemental
brief
we
filed
an
answer
to
the
reply
brief
filed
by
petitioner.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
didn't
read
them
that
way.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
my
impression
to
these
cases
were
that
they
did
provide
for
enhanced
punishment
for
greater
punishment.
he
did
not
have
a
different
crime
just
as
we
do
not
have
a
different
crime
under
texas
state.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
would
not.
we
do
have
the
same
situation
on
driving
while
intoxicated
and
driving
while
intoxicated
second
offense
and
i
think
under
the
national
firearms
act
you
have
transportation
across
the
state
line
of
a
firearms
by
a
person
who
has
been
previously
convicted,
but
that
is
not
in
this
case.
this
court
also
has
recognized
in
the
past
that
it
was
a
common
practice
to
handle
these
cases
in
this
time.
and
again
i
call
the
court's
attention
on
the
supplemental
brief
in
brown
versus
west
virginia
when
mr.
justice
hughes
stated
it
was
a
familiar
practice
to
set
forth
in
the
indictment
the
fact
of
the
prior
conviction
and
submit
to
the
jury
the
evidence
upon
that
issue
together
without
relating
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
on
which
the
indictment
charge.
and
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
in
1954
in
chandler
versus
fretag,
made
a
summary
statement
that
while
this
could
be
a
separate
issue
and
could
be
tried
separately,
that
it
was
common
practice
to
try
it
in
this
manner.
again,
mr.
justice
clark
in
oyler
versus
boles
and
crabtree
versus
boles
made
the
same
statement
referring
back
in
that
instance
that
authority
to
chandler
versus
fretag.
so
it's
a
practice
that
has
been
followed
and
while
not
this
question
was
not
before
the
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
practice
certainly
test
the
approval
was
given
by
this
court
in
stating
this
is
a
practice
that
may
followed.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
west
--
graham
versus
west
virginia.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
contains
that
language
and
you
said
it
in
graham
versus
west
virginia
also.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
a
little
farther
that
in
this
particular
case
i
think
the
facts
of
the
case
itself
come
within
the
rule
that
even
though
harsh
as
it
may
be
that
this
court
set
out
in
fay
versus
connecticut
and
that
is
that
it
must
--
that
there
cannot
be
any
reasonable
probability
that
the
evidence
in
question
affected
the
verdict
to
the
jury.
now,
in
this
case
i
don't
think
that
a
jury
of
12
reasonable
men
could
have
reached
any
other
conclusion
where
a
man
robbed
the
store.
he
left
the
store
manager
and
the
assistant
in
the
vault.
he
had
held
them
up
with
a
gold-plated
pistol.
he
forced
them
to
put
money
in
a
bag
that
had
the
store
marking
on
it.
they
were
able
to
secure
their
release
from
the
vault
because
it
had
a
provision
where
it
could
always
be
opened
from
the
inside,
they
called
the
authorities.
the
highway
patrol,
among
other
law
enforcement
officers
were
notified.
the
officers
were
starting
to
set
up
a
roadblock.
they
then
noticed
a
car
that
approached
and
then
made
a
u-turn.
they
gave
pursuit.
the
car
violated
the
speed
limit.
they
stopped
the
car
and
in
result
in
action
in
giving
a
ticket.
one
of
the
officers
looked
in
the
car
and
saw
the
gold-plated
pistol
on
the
seat.
they
went
through
the
car,
they
found
the
money
bag
where
the
money,
the
change
still
in
them
and
the
bills
under
the
seat.
the
store
manager
then
identified
the
defendant.
he
identified
the
money
bags,
the
amount
taken
corresponded
with
the
amount
that
had
been
taken
from
the
store.
there
was
a
case
of
actual
identity
and
arrest
just
a
very
short
time
after
the
crime
and
the
proceeds
of
the
crime
in
the
possession
of
the
individual.
there
was
no
rebuttal
evidence
offered
whatsoever
to
explain
these
facts
nor
did
the
defendant
take
a
stand
in
an
attempt
to
explain.
now,
the
only
evidence
that
was
offered
in
his
defense
was
by
his
mother
who
said
that
she
believed
that
he
must
be
insane
if
he
did
it
that
he
had
had
a
head
injury
and
that
she
had
noticed
that
he
had
acted
peculiarly.
and
that
he
had
him
treated
or
attempted
to
have
him
treated
in
a
mental
institution.
there
was
rebuttal
evidence
in
the
issue
of
insanity.
it's
not
--
it
was
given
to
the
jury
decided
against
the
defendant
and
is
not
a
part
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
only
question
is
under
the
rulings
then
in
fay
versus
connecticut
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
this
evidence
by
the
inclusion,
should
it
be
constitutionally
impermissible
which
we
still
deny
and
whether
or
not
any
jury
of
12
unbiased
persons
would
have
reached
a
different
verdict
and
i
do
--
i
present
to
the
court
that
in
examining
this
record.
now
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
which
is
included
in
the
record
details
this
evidence.
these
facts
have
not
been
denied
and
in
fact
counsel
admitted
that
the
statement
was
fair.
we
did
not
reproduce
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
this
court
has
asked.
you
of
course
have
the
original
transcript
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
one
copy.
we
reproduced
a
remainder
of
the
evidence
of
the
court,
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
if
they
want
to
examine
the
acts
of
facts
rather
than
take
word
of
counsel
both
of
us
feel
though
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
fairly
sets
this
matter
out.
if
you
wish
it
in
entirety
we
have
it
in,
we'll
be
glad
to
leave
it
with
the
clerks
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
now,
i
do
think
that
this
court
certainly
is
designed
to
protect
the
individual.
it
was
created
for
that
purpose.
our
very
constitution
gives
it
that
duty
but
also
there
is
a
duty
to
society
and
the
individual
is
protected
because
he's
a
member
of
that
society.
in
facts
as
we
have
in
this
type
of
case,
i
think
this
court
would
be
doing
a
great
service
to
society
to
establish
a
rule
that
would
release
these
people
who
to
say
the
least
that
has
shown
that
they
are
not
quite
adjusted
to
live
in
a
social
society.
for
all
laws
are
liberal,
that
of
course
would
not
waive
any
question
of
constitutionality,
as
i
grant
you
that.
but
i
do
urge
the
court
to
carefully
consider
this
record
and
the
facts
of
this
case
as
well
as
the
facts
that
the
defendant
by
his
own
acts
in
refusing
to
admit
identity
as
a
procedural
matter
not
as
an
element
of
crime
injected
into
this
case
the
question
of
which
he
now
complains.
thank
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
you're
asking
if
the
alleged
prior
convictions
then
do
not
prove?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
but
he
was
found
guilty
of
first
offense.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
think
there
again
it
was
an
issue
and
the
jury
would
be
more
likely
to
not
believe
the
state
if
they
could
not
prove
all
of
their
indictment
even
though
if
they
had
--
if
they
failed
in
proof
here
of
that
regard
certainly
the
jury
would
be
finding
it's
nothing
to
it.
this
man
was
a
good
character
at
that
time.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
thank
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
would
by
admitting
that
his
identity
as
being
the
same
person
charged
and
convicted
of
the
prior
offenses.
if
he
had
made
that
admission
then
that
evidence
could
not
or
the
charge
in
the
indictment
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
jury
nor
could
have
evidence
it's
been
presented.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
under
texas
procedures,
there
are
number
of
them
saying.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
old
procedure.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
mr.
justice
white
under
the
ground
that
the
defendant
has
injected
this
element
into
a
case
by
not
admitting
his
identity.
certainly,
it
was
a
procedure
that
has
been
filed
in
texas
since
1853
and
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
if
possibly
that
this
court
if
i
presented
to
them
with
a
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
legislature
has
the
power
to
pass
statute
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
that
under
the
decisions,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
interpretation
given
to
the
constitution
by
this
court.
or
the
statute
can
be
given
fact.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
yes.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
on
the
grounds
that
as
set
out
in
michelson.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
see
but
it
would
be
applied
i
believe
it's
correct
to
state
procedure
now.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
have
held
that
it
would
extend
the
question
of
procedural
due
process
to
state
cases.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
might
be
--
i
might
been
here
as
to
particular
case
but
i
was
–
it
is
my
impression
that
it
was
in
michelson.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it's
a
question
--
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
admission
of
character
evidence.
and
it
is
impermissible
i
would
think
in
federal
court
under
the
interpretations
we
submitted
this
court
has
made
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
would
extend
the
state
practice.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
well
you
have
held
a
number
of
state
laws
in
the
application
to
be
unconstitutional.
for
example
the
denial
of
counsel.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
also,
mr.
justice
black,
under
the
question
of
due
process
whether
or
not
the
man
received
a
fair
trial.
i
am
thinking
about
say
possibly
under
the
riddo
(ph)
case
where
the
confession
with
broadcast
or
the
turner
case
where
the
deputy
sheriff
had
jury
to
mind.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
the
question
of
character
injection
of
character
into
the
trial
where
it
is
not
relevant
then
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
an
impartial
jury
from
the
time
that
that
element
is
undertaken.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
certain
type
of
crimes
under
again
i
think
our
preponderance
rules
of
evidence
as
i
have
seen
them
(inaudible).
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
that
your
answer
in
that
in
my
impression
is
in
line
with
what
mr.
justice
black
was
asking.
i
think
that
the
man
is
being
denied
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
tribunal
by
slipping
those
matters
to
a
jury
they
could
not
be
entered
to
as
an
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
trial.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
feel
that
possibly
they
were
going
a
little
too
far
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
think
that
it
would
go
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
of
impartiality
of
the
jury
that
that
would
be
say
--
shall
we
say
stretching
the
rules
of
evidence
to
such
an
extent.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
go
back
to
the
premise
again
that
it
is
very
relevant
to
the
sentence
itself
and
has
been
injected
by
the
defense.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
jury
sentence
is
in
texas.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
under
the
former
procedure
that
was
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
done.
there
were
no
other
provisions
by
law.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
has
been
changed
now.
whether
the
legislature
says
the
present
method
is
better
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
some
places
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
capital
case,
you're
right
mr.
justice
clark.
they
still
use
the
old
procedure
in
the
capital
case.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
only
in
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it's
not
--
it
was
not
permitted
and
it's
still
not
permitted.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
all
because
the
jury
had
the
sentence.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
admitted
it
out.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
they
were
not
suppose
as
to
whether
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
on
some
of
the
cases
they
did.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
fix
the
sentence
except
under
the
enhancement
statutes.
automatically
it
becomes
a
question
of
law
on
page
62
and
page
63
cases.
because
if
the
jury
finds
or
if
the
man
admits
the
prior
offenses
then
as
a
matter
of
law
his
sentences
shall
be
like
under
63
cases
and
shall
be
the
maximum
allowed
under
62
cases.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
need
not,
if
it
did
it
will
lead
grounds
for
reversal.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
to
determine
--
the
way
i
understand
the
interpretation
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
stated
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
but
they
could
avoid,
there
are
number
of
cases
which
say
that
they
can
avoid
the
injection
of
this
issue
before
the
jury
by
admitting
that.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
all
i
can
answer
in
that
regard
is
that
since
