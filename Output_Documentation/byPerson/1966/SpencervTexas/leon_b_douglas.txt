crime,
murder

mr.

what
was
this
crime?
mr.

b.
douglas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
has
been
mentioned
before
like
the
other
cases.
i'll
try
not
to
rehash
the
other
law.
i
will
try
to
answer
some
of
the
other
questions
maybe
you've
asked
before.
this
is
a
murder
case,
murder
with
malice
and
punishment
is
death.
the

bought
a

her

she
fell
over
on

the

got

the

pulled
him
off
and
shot
her
four
times
in
the
head
and
face
and
he
walked
out
and
says
that
she
is
no
good.
he
grinned
and
took
the
gun
and
went
to
the
sheriff's
office.
those
were
the
facts
in
the
case
and
the
when
i
say
the
facts
overwhelming
i
cannot
see
how
any
jury
could
reach
any
other
verdict
guilty
in
this
particular
case
and
then
it
was
the
matter
of
punishment
of
getting
in
the
prior
offense.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
they
could
have
given
a
suspended
sentence.
they
could
have
given
two
years
in
the
penitentiary
up
to
life
or
death.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
and
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
i
believe
about
15
years
of
being
life
sentence.
i
can
see
that
murder
is
cheap
in
texas
and
under
this
particular
type
of
case
that
is
a
fairly
good
high
verdict
on
the
first
case.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
that
we
have
--
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
sir.
we
have
indeterminate
sentence
in
maine.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
do
not
know
your
honor
but
in
1951
conviction
and
i
did
not
--
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
served
it.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
he's
eligible
for
--
and
the
oldest
code
before
1966
in
the
third
of
his
time.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
and
he
can
make
that
five
years
in
two-and-a-half
years.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
it
only
has
to
do
with
penalty
and
for
the
overall
recidivist
statute
that
made
an
answer

one
of
questions.
they
say
it
is

to

of
course
where
one
gets
the
maximum
penalty
you
can't
rehabilitate
there
but
i
mean
for
your
general
recidivist,
they
go
on
rehabilitation
and
deterrent.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
that
is
correct
and
the
jury
has
so
instructed
that
they
will
not
consider
that
as
a
matter
of
guilt.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
will
give
you
the
reasoning
your
honor
in
the
court's
opinion.
they
say
where
the
penalty
is
absolutely
fixed
by
law
and
he
admits
that
he
is
person
previously
convicted
the
jury
shall
not
hold
back
but
where
there
is
a
leeway
in
the
punishment
then
the
jury
hears
all
that
evidence
to
assess
punishment
but
where
it's
absolutely
fixed
by
law,
well
then
their
reasoning
was
that
the
jury
shouldn't
notice.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
under
--
not
in
capital
cases.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
this
capital
case,
no.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
you,
it
was
our
procedure
established
by
our
legislature
and
it
has
been
followed
all
these
times
in
the
--
i
don't
know
where
it
was
borne
down,
it
was
borne
in
this
case
or
in
the
other
case.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
it
was
--
it
was
read
to
the
jury.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
read
to
the
jury
and
then
the
evidence
was
introduced.
i
believe
in
this
particular
case
the
evidence
of
its
prior
conviction
was
introduced
first.
by
fingerprints
the
showing
with
his
record
and
by
fingerprint
experts
showing
that
they
are
known
--
yes
and
plus
his
indictment,
plus
his
judgment,
plus
his
sentence
and
then
the
evidence
as
to
his
guilt.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
and
then
the
matter
was
--
they
had
--
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
the
--
no
they
were
instructed
not
to
consider
the
prior
crime
on
hill.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
not
to
consider,
yes.
and
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap).
oh!
i'm
sure
that
there's
nothing
up
here
on
it
but
i
am
sure
it
is
mentioned
and
assessed.
if
i've
been
prosecutor,
i
would
mention
it.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
except.
no,
no,
nothing.
now
in
this
particular
case,
the
threat
that
was
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
out.
but
i
take
it
had
about
much
fact
ruling
that
out.
i
kill
you
like
i
killed
my
first
wife.
i
take
it
that
that
had
as
much
bearing
as
the
first
instruction
don't
get
it
consider
the
prior
one
on
guilt.
they
probably
considered
both
of
them.
and
our
article
1257
(a)
and
i
cited
it
in
the
brief
and
in
the
baker
case
that
was
cited
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
in
error
in
ruling
it
out.
the
jury
had
that
before
you
and
you
take
a
case
of
this
type,
many
cases
like
one
of
them
in
the
case
i
remember
says
where
did
you
learn
the
(inaudible)
like
that,
a
murder
case,
a
robbery
case.
he
says,
i
learned
it
in
the
penitentiary.
it
was
raised
(inaudible)
where
we
lose
the
colleague
it
was
introduced
and
it's
inadmissible.
another
one
like
that
says,
please
quit
it
and
you
get
in
trouble.
the
man
says
i've
been
in
the
penitentiary
before.
this
evidence
is
going
to
get
before
the
jury
in
most
instances
and
it
probably
--
it
got
before
the
jury
but
the
judge
took
it
out.
now
someone
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
on
admitting
a
prior
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark,
if
the
defendant
on
the
ordinary
procedure
admits
his
prior
convictions
not
a
capital
case.
if
i
may
attempt
to
answer
that
question
that
he
will
be
found
guilty
and
then
he
may
select
the
judge
or
the
jury
to
assess
the
punishment.
they
are
priors
of
the
amount
of
punishment.
and
then
the
record
under
the
new
code
is
admissible
and
they
will
know
of
the
prior
convictions
before
they
assess
the
punishment.
even
though
it
is
absolutely
fixed
by
law
the
legislature
so
provided
that
the
jury
would
assess
the
punishment
and
now
prior
crimes
on
texas
are
not
admissible
generally.
in
the
case,
that
decided
this
roxas
versus
state
and
that
discusses
our
new
code
in
the
procedure
on
it
which
holds
that
as
they
argue
them
more
and
they
don't
want
to
take
it.
i
say
this
same
rule
is
applied
to
capital
cases
and
i
think
the
roxas
case
said
so.
and
it's
in
403
2d
30.
and
judge
woodley
in
his
opinion
points
out
that
texas
does
not
allow
crimes
committed
yesterday
or
the
day
before
to
be
admitted
in
the
present
trial.
we
do
not
have
that
rule
in
texas,
but
most
states
do
have
that.
we're
in
the
minority
in
there.
and
mr.
justice
white
stole
my
argument
when
he
said
this
everything
you
put
in
is
prejudicial.
so
this
is
prejudicial.
but
the
evidence
that
he
shot
his
wife
is
prejudicial.
it's
all
prejudicial
but
it's
a
texas
rule.
it's
an
exclusionary
rule
there
of
evidence.
it
does
not
meet
constitutional
standards
and
i
think
that
the
court
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
wolfe
versus
nash
is
313
f.2d
393
and
in
dealing
with
an
individual
criminal
statute,
this
is
eighth
circuit
and
it
says
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
enable
us
to
review
errors
in
state
law.
and
we
submit
that
if
this
is
--
that
if
it
is
an
error
it's
an
error
of
state
law
and
it
does
not
have
constitutional
prohibitions.
now,
someone
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
what
happens
to
this
statute.
what
does
this
do
to
the
extraneous
offense?
article
3707
section
(f)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
it
does
not
affect
the
rules
on
27.
this
procedure
does
not
specifically
on
the
statute.
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
the
state
of
texas
has
nothing
further
to
present
unless
you
have
questions.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
opinion
in
roxas
vs.
state
is
42nd,
i
believe,
30.
in
the
motion
for
rehearing,
the
opinion
by
judge
woodley
said
that
3707
did
not
apply
to
capital
cases,
that’s
the
ultimate
punishment
statute.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
that
is
correct.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
that
is
the
point
i
tried
to
cede
and
had
difficult
in
getting
the
opponent
to
accept.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
your
honor,
that
was
the
law
in
pitcock
vs.
state.
it
came
down
and
that
pitcock
case
is
cited
in
opinion
on
the
spencer.
but
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
justices,
the
sims
case
and
the
ross
case
cited
here
yesterday,
there
must
be
two
legal
(inaudible).
how
they
got
to
the
court,
i
do
not
know.
and
there
is
cases
saying
that
you
can't
stipulate
and
prevent
it
being
going
to
the
jury
but
the
ross
case
and
the
sams
case
cited
by
mr.
scott
in
the
first
case
yesterday
indicates
perhaps
you
cannot.
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
court's
decisions,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
–
depending
upon
the
court
of
criminal
of
appeal's
holding,
i‘d
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
what
they
would
hold
on
there.
those
two
cases
are
just
like
sore
thumbs
taking
out.
i'd
think
that
if
it
was
pushed,
the
court
would
permit
the
stipulation
of
the
prior
convictions
and
require
no
proof
or
reading
of
the
indictment.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
cannot
reconcile
those
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
cannot
fail
find
if
there
is
one
case
after
the
ross
or
the
sims
case.
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
it
is.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
it
had
been
the
general
practice
not
to
do
it
if
they
agreed
to
stipulate
it,
your
honor.
and
these
two
cases
came
up
that
probably
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
those
moved
to
the
cases
that
are
those
two
got
by.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
401
was
been
in
1966.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
pitcock
case
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
spencer
case,
their
case
they
stipulated
to
prior
convictions
they
offered
to
and
the
court
reversed
that
case
because
they
did
not
allow.
and,
the
penalty
as
absolutely
fixed
by
law,
then
the
jury
knows
nothing
about
it,
they
had
found
him
guilty.
then
the
judge
under
the
old
code
assessed
the
penalty
as
maximum
provided
by
law.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
what
crime,
murder
with
malice?
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
what
was
this
crime?
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
has
been
mentioned

like
the
other
cases.

b.
douglas
the
--
no
they
were
instructed
not
to
consider
the
prior
crime
on
hill.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
not
to
consider,
yes.
and
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap).
oh!
i'm
sure
that
there's
nothing
up
here
on
it
but
i
am
sure
it
is
mentioned
and
assessed.
if
i've
been
prosecutor,
i
would
mention
it.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
except.
no,
no,
nothing.
now
in
this
particular
case,
the
threat
that
was
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
out.
but
i
take
it
had
about
much
fact
ruling
that
out.
i
kill
you
like
i
killed
my
first
wife.
i
take
it
that
that
had
as
much
bearing
as
the
first
instruction
don't
get
it
consider
the
prior
one
on
guilt.
they
probably
considered
both
of
them.
and
our
article
1257
(a)
and
i
cited
it
in
the
brief
and
in
the
baker
case
that
was
cited
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
in
error
in
ruling
it
out.
the
jury
had
that
before
you
and
you
take
a
case
of
this
type,
many
cases
like
one
of
them
in
the
case
i
remember
says
where
did
you
learn
the
(inaudible)
like
that,
a
murder
case,
a
robbery
case.
he
says,
i
learned
it
in
the
penitentiary.
it
was
raised
(inaudible)
where
we
lose
the
colleague
it
was
introduced
and
it's
inadmissible.
another
one
like
that
says,
please
quit
it
and
you
get
in
trouble.
the
man
says
i've
been
in
the
penitentiary
before.
this
evidence
is
going
to
get
before
the
jury
in
most
instances
and
it
probably
--
it
got
before
the
jury
but
the
judge
took
it
out.
now
someone
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
on
admitting
a
prior
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark,
if
the
defendant
on
the
ordinary
procedure
admits
his
prior
convictions
not
a
capital
case.
if
i
may
attempt
to
answer
that
question
that
he
will
be
found
guilty
and
then
he
may
select
the
judge
or
the
jury
to
assess
the
punishment.
they
are
priors
of
the
amount
of
punishment.
and
then
the
record
under
the
new
code
is
admissible
and
they
will
know
of
the
prior
convictions
before
they
assess
the
punishment.
even
though
it
is
absolutely
fixed
by
law
the
legislature
so
provided
that
the
jury
would
assess
the
punishment
and
now
prior
crimes
on
texas
are
not
admissible
generally.
in
the
case,
that
decided
this
roxas
versus
state
and
that
discusses
our
new
code
in
the
procedure
on
it
which
holds
that
as
they
argue
them
more
and
they
don't
want
to
take
it.
i
say
this
same
rule
is
applied
to
capital
cases
and
i
think
the
roxas
case
said
so.
and
it's
in
403
2d
30.
and
judge
woodley
in
his
opinion
points
out
that
texas
does
not
allow
crimes
committed
yesterday
or
the
day
before
to
be
admitted
in
the
present
trial.
we
do
not
have
that
rule
in
texas,
but
most
states
do
have
that.
we're
in
the
minority
in
there.
and
mr.
justice
white
stole
my
argument
when
he
said
this
everything
you
put
in
is
prejudicial.
so
this
is
prejudicial.
but
the
evidence
that
he
shot
his
wife
is
prejudicial.
it's
all
prejudicial
but
it's
a
texas
rule.
it's
an
exclusionary
rule
there
of
evidence.
it
does
not
meet
constitutional
standards
and
i
think
that
the
court
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
wolfe
versus
nash
is
313
f.2d
393
and
in
dealing
with
an
individual
criminal
statute,
this
is
eighth
circuit
and
it
says
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
enable
us
to
review
errors
in
state
law.
and
we
submit
that
if
this
is
--
that
if
it
is
an
error
it's
an
error
of
state
law
and
it
does
not
have
constitutional
prohibitions.
now,
someone
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
what
happens
to
this
statute.
what
does
this
do
to
the
extraneous
offense?
article
3707
section
(f)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
it
does
not
affect
the
rules
on
27.
this
procedure
does
not
specifically
on
the
statute.
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
the
state
of
texas
has
nothing
further
to
present
unless
you
have
questions.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
opinion
in
roxas
vs.
state
is
42nd,
i
believe,
30.
in
the
motion
for
rehearing,
the
opinion
by
judge
woodley
said
that
3707
did
not
apply
to
capital
cases,
that’s
the
ultimate
punishment
statute.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
that
is
correct.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
that
is
the
point
i
tried
to
cede
and
had
difficult
in
getting
the
opponent
to
accept.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
your
honor,
that
was
the
law
in
pitcock
vs.
state.
it
came
down
and
that
pitcock
case
is
cited
in
opinion
on
the
spencer.
but
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
justices,
the
sims
case
and
the
ross
case
cited
here
yesterday,
there
must
be
two
legal
(inaudible).
how
they
got
to
the
court,
i
do
not
know.
and
there
is
cases
saying
that
you
can't
stipulate
and
prevent
it
being
going
to
the
jury
but
the
ross
case
and
the
sams
case
cited
by
mr.
scott
in
the
first
case
yesterday
indicates
perhaps
you
cannot.
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
court's
decisions,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
–
depending
upon
the
court
of
criminal
of
appeal's
holding,
i‘d
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
what
they
would
hold
on
there.
those
two
cases
are
just
like
sore
thumbs
taking
out.
i'd
think
that
if
it
was
pushed,
the
court
would
permit
the
stipulation
of
the
prior
convictions
and
require
no
proof
or
reading
of
the
indictment.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
cannot
reconcile
those
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
i
cannot
fail
find
if
there
is
one
case
after
the
ross
or
the
sims
case.
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
it
is.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
it
had
been
the
general
practice
not
to
do
it
if
they
agreed
to
stipulate
it,
your
honor.
and
these
two
cases
came
up
that
probably
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
those
moved
to
the
cases
that
are
those
two
got
by.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
401
was
been
in
1966.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
pitcock
case
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
spencer
case,
their
case
they
stipulated
to
prior
convictions
they
offered
to
and
the
court
reversed
that
case
because
they
did
not
allow.
and,
the
penalty
as
absolutely
fixed
by
law,
then
the
jury
knows
nothing
about
it,
they
had
found
him
guilty.
then
the
judge
under
the
old
code
assessed
the
penalty
as
maximum
provided
by
law.
