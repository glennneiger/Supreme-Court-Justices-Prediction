mr.
michael
d.
matheny
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
defendant
in
this
case
leon
spencer
was
charged
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
article
64
with
the
offense
of
murder
with
malice
and
murder
with
malice
reputation.
he
was
charged
with
the
offense
of
murdering
with
malice,
his
common-law
wife
lavinia
erdie.
the
reputation
for
it
of
the
indictment
charge
at
some
15
years
prior
to
this
that
he
had
been
convicted
in
the
same
courtroom
of
the
offense
of
murder
with
malice
of
the
former
wife.
not
the
same
wife
sir.
the
defendant
from
the
very
beginning,
i
tried
this
case
on
the
trial
court
level
and
recognized
the
problem
that
this
man
would
have
on
trial
for
his
wife
to
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
from
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
of
murder
with
malice.
attempts
were
made
before
the
trial
actually
even
began
or
before
any
juror
were
questioned
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
this
prior
evidence
because
under
article
64,
it
was
not
admissible
for
any
purpose
except
in
the
situation
when
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
with
malice
and
the
jury
in
this
case
found
this
defendant
guilty
of
only
murder
without
malice
under
the
applicable
texas
cases
the
first
conviction
would
have
been
inadmissible
for
any
purpose.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir,
not
in
the
state
of
texas,
it
would
not
and
it
was
ruled
inadmissible
by
the
trial
court.
this
is
taken
out
of
context.
it's
not
in
the
printed
record
and
if
a
close
check
is
made
on
the
certified
record,
he
would
repeal
that
an
objection
was
made
because
this
was
testimony
put
up
by
the
state
by
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
woman
and
was
in
regards
to
testimony
that
occurred
three
years
before
this
woman
was
killed
or
said
to
be
killed.
three
years
before
in
the
trial
court
rule
that
it
was
entirely
too
remote
and
should
not
be
considered
for
any
purpose.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
baker
versus
states
is
the
testimony
of
threatening
and
in
that
case
the
trial
court
ruled
that
it
was
admissible.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
the
trial
court
in
the
trial
of
this
case
decided
what
the
law
is
in
the
state
of
texas
decided
that
this
was
too
remote
and
was
not
admissible
and
this
would
be
a
threat
and
not
a
prior
conviction
of
murder
with
malice.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
the
defendant
further
entered
into
a
judicial
stipulation
that
he
was
the
same
individual
that
have
been
convicted
before
and
further
that
for
the
first
conviction
was
constitutionally
valid
and
there
was
nothing
for
the
jury
to
decide
before
they
determined
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
this
was
overruled.
now,
when
it
falls
down
to
this
court
although
i
recognize
the
distinction
that
mr.
justice
black
is
making
and
what
he
is
saying
about
with
the
marshall
case
and
supervisory
powers
of
this
court
over
the
federal
court
but
we
have
up
here
is
a
man
is
being
tried
for
his
very
life.
and
this
goes
beyond
the
rules
of
evidence
of
a
blurting
out
of
a
witness
that
there
has
been
a
prior
conviction.
this
exaggerates
the
entire
fact-finding
procedure
guilt
or
innocence
of
this
man.
when
he
went
all
the
way
back
to
the
questioning
of
each
individual
juror
who
finally
set
up
a
jury
it
was
explained
to
them
that
the
state
was
contending
in
this
very
courtroom
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
a
murder
before.
this
was
read
to
him
from
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
when
a
complete
wide
of
reason,
yes
sir.
the
reason
that
i
would
say
this
is
unconstitutional
goes
back
to
what
this
court
says
on
due
process,
in
betts
versus
brady
as
to
the
situation
of
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
betts
versus
brady
what
would
constitute
the
due
process
in
one
case
might
not
in
another.
and
this
goes
further
than
this
court
saying
to
the
states
what
is
fair,
there
is
fair
way,
not
what
is
a
fair
and
what
is
fair.
i
am
saying
that
when
a
man
is
on
trial
for
his
life
the
effect
he
was
tried
for
this
first
conviction
that
half
of
the
proofs
put
on
by
the
state
went
to
the
first
conviction.
that
each
juror
has
been
told
he's
been
convicted
before
that
the
indictment
signed
by
a
grand
jury
was
introduced
into
evidence
as
the
first
court
has
been
approved
by
the
state
the
certified
copy
which
in
the
former
case
the
state
said
was
not
admissible.
the
certified
copy
was
admitted.
the
verdict
of
the
prior
jury
was
admitted
showing
that
he
had
been
convicted.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no
sir
it
comes
back
as
to
in
this
line
of
reasoning
i
still
believe
that
the
main
issue
was
whether
man
has
been
denied
of
fair
and
impartial
jury
and
not
as
a
rule
of
evidence
of
one
thing
in
that
there
has
been
--
has
there
been
in
this
matter
this
individual
case
of
this
man
charged
with
a
capital
offense
of
continuing
and
continuing
and
continuing
and
continuing,
going
into
this
again
and
again
two
live
witnesses
who
testified
they
were
present
before
and
he
was
the
same
man
and
the
same
courtroom
that
was
convicted
introducing
a
picture
of
them
with
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
if
it
is
admissible,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
it
is
not
admissible.
what
i
was
saying
is
this
court
has
have
then
when
we
go
into
past
opinions
that
the
jury
should
enter
into
a
jury
box
with
a
clear
mind.
the
behavioral
scientist
call
this
something
called
tabula
rasa,
it
means,
i
may
not
pronounce
this
correctly.
meaning
a
clean
slate,
that
they
have
no
fixed
opinion
as
to
this
man's
guilt
or
innocence
and
the
state
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
first
murder
was
a
conviction
15
years
before
the
murder
of
the
former
wife.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
his
then
wife,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
his
charge
was
to
the
conviction,
was
a
charge
of
murdering
another
wife.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
except
mr.
justice
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
black
i
believe
the
people
who
that
studied
the
civilizations
of
the
world
had
stated
that
each
culture
is
determined
by
the
guarantees
that
it
gives
to
each
individual
person
no
matter
what
type
of
person
he
is,
what
type
of
evil
may
he
is
or
what
he
has
been
involved
before
and
under
our
constitution
you
are
entitled
to
have
an
impartial
finding
by
an
impartial
jury
from
the
basis
of
what
you're
charged
with
this
time
that
just
because
you've
done
something
before
is
no
evidence
that
you've
done
it
this
time.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir,
it
is
none.
and
the
reason
again,
does
this
procedure
prevent
the
probability
of
unfairness?
i
say
not
only
does
it
not
prevent
the
probability
of
unfairness,
it
fosters
unfairness.
the
--
i
have
been
unable
to
find
one
case
and
i
am
not
saying
there
are
no
cases
like
this
mentioned
before.
i
have
been
able
to
find
no
case
and
the
state
in
its
brief
has
cited
no
case.
it
states
that
this
prior
conviction
was
admissible
for
the
purpose
showing
a
man
propensity
for
trial.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
first
murder
was
convicted
by
this
man
stabbing
the
woman
in
the
neck.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
second
murder
was
convicted
by
this
man
shooting
his
wife
in
the
head
as
to
what
the
facts
alleged
by
the
statute.
it
came
--
but
it
still
comes
back
to
this
man
as
entitled
to
have
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
primary
offense
and
that
the
courts
have
held
that
this
testimony
override,
it's
so
overwhelming
in
the
average
person's
mind
that
would
sit
upon
a
jury
that
he
could
not
separate.
and
in
texas,
it
would
not
have
been
admissible
for
any
purposes
other
than
to
accept
the
punishment
of
the
defendant.
this
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
texas
has
held
that
in
another
habitual
criminal
offense
when
you
have
a
non-capital
prior
offense
and
a
charge
capital
offense
that
you
could
not
combine
because
it
is
unfair
to
do
so
because
this
would
overweigh
with
the
jury
and
they
would
not
be
able
to
have
a
impartial
jury
under
the
terms
of
provision
to
the
sixth
amendment
and
they
reverse
such
a
case.
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
in
any
jurisdiction
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
united
states
has
this
prove
been
introduced
in
any
other
case
except
in
habitual
criminal
situations.
if
he
had
been
charged
with
running
a
stop
sign,
with
speeding,
with
parking
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
the
court
would
say
that
this
evidence
is
not
admissible
to
show
his
propensity
of
the
crime
in
the
so
overwhelming
it
is
prejudicial.
and
that
in
the
state
of
texas
had
he
been
charged
--
with
his
--
haven't
been
convicted
once
before,
haven't
been
charged
on
any
other
crime,
any
other
crime
on
the
trial
of
that
same
courtroom
for
running
a
red
light,
for
running
a
stop
sign,
this
evidence
would
not
have
been
admissible
and
court
would
say
if
you
did,
if
it's
so
overbearing
that
you
could
not
get
an
impartial
jury.
so
it
falls
down
to
this,
can
we
have
two
standards
for
what
an
impartial
hearing
is.
a
person
that's
been
involved
with
a
crime
that
the
state
says
that
we're
going
to
show
this
time
that
he
be
denied
an
impartial
hearing
should
he
be
denied
comes
back
in
not
one
case
studied
by
the
state
as
the
court
has
sustained
the
state's
position
giving
any
reason
for
doing
so
except
because
the
state
in
its
prior
argument
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
did
not
answer
what
is
the
basis,
what
necessity
is
there
for
confusing
the
jury
and
prejudicing
the
jury
with
the
existence
of
the
prior
conviction
before
the
determination
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
and
the
answer
is
there
is
no
necessity
this
is
known
throughout
the
state
of
texas
as
the
prosecutor's
door.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
prosecutor's
door.
and
many
people
had
been
convicted
on
slim
facts
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
because
there
is
no
way
to
tell.
you
can't
go
back
into
the
juror
line.
but
how
many
weak
facts
where
the
determination
and
it's
the
burden
on
the
state
to
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
based
on
moral
certainty
that
this
man's
action
that
resulted
in
the
crime.
it
resulted
on
the
guilt
because
of
that
overriding
fact,
the
procedure
that
we
have
in
texas
now
according
to
the
state's
attorney
in
every
case
besides
the
capital
case.
i
have
read
the
roxas
case
and
i
disagree.
that's
a
concurring
opinion
that
talks
about
--
that
case,
i
don't
believe
that
has
been
cited
by
the
court.
but
it
comes
back
to
makes
it
even
more
important
if
it's
still
there
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir,
it
is
not
they
are
more
likely
to
commit
a
third
and
what
i
have
read
about
it
is
your
honor,
that
the
state
is
taking
crimes
for
which
the
punishment
for
a
first
defense
should
not
be
but
five
years
based
upon
the
theory
which
probably
is
incorrect
that
you
should
make
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
and
that
consciously
or
conscientiously
the
state
cannot
inflict
a
punishment
for
the
primary
offense
of
stealing
a
car
of
the
maximum
of
10
years
in
the
penitentiary
and
on
the
third
time
if
a
man
steals
a
car
again
that
for
the
primary
offense
that
they
cannot
consciously
again
make
a
punishment
of
life
for
stealing
an
automobile
then
therefore
when
a
man
has
done
it
three
times
that
they
are
trying
to
make
an
additional
burden
on
this
person
not
to
create
an
additional
punishment
for
this
individual
but
all
of
these
does
not
go
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
i
am
sorry.
i
believe
they
pose
a
greater
sense
for
an
individual
on
the
third
theft
to
punish
that
individual
because
he
cannot
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
what
it.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir
because
(voice
overlap).
no
sir
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
believe
that
that
may
be
perhaps
relevant
but
that
may
be
relevant.
i
would
think
in
that,
that's
the
whole
basis
of
the
whole
--
of
the
contention
here
mr.
justice
black
is
that
because
of
human
nature
i
personally
would
think
that
a
man
that
has
been
involved
with
a
trouble
with
the
law
before
is
the
type
of
person
that
would
be
involved
and
has
trouble
with
the
law.
but
our
system
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
because
of
the
reason
that
this
would
overbear
so
much
for
the
jury
that
it
would
cloud
their
mind
so
much
that
the
average
juror
or
the
average
judge
or
the
most
educated
attorney
could
not
completely
separate
this
man
this
from
his
mind
and
only
use
it
to
determine
the
punishment
to
be
inflicted.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir.
it
comes
back
to
--
if
these
were
an
isolated
instance
in
trial
of
the
rule
of
evidence
and
whether
this
particular
piece
could
come
in
that
would
be
one.
but
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
from
beginning
to
end,
his
trial
was
such
that
he
did
not
receive
due
process
of
law
that
the
standards
that
our
constitution
required
and
that's
i
can
see
and
what
you're
saying
mr.
justice
black
i
realize
you're
saying
that
although
it
may
be
unfair
to
do
this
wherein
the
constitution
doesn't
say
you
can.
but
i
am
saying
is
that
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
man
did
not
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
before
a
fair
and
trial
impartial
jury
because
of
the
accumulation
of
all
these
evidence
being
introduced
for
no
other
purpose
than
decide
his
punishment
and
this
will
not
come
into
play
to
the
defending
guilty
of
murder
with
malice.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
if
the
legislators
or
attorneys
and
people
well-versed
in
either
human
nature
in
the
trial
of
lawsuits
it
should
be
the
legislature.
i
would
be
the
first
person
to
say
that
the
offense
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
but
he
comes
back
to
all
of
these
people
and
all
what
the
jurisdiction
says
because
of
what
makes
the
common
person
take
that
this
evidence
weigh
so
heavily
that
a
person
accused
of
crime
cannot
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
state
of
texas
has
stated
that
such
evidence
denies
the
person
of
a
fair
trial
and
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
the
courts
have
said
that
such
evidence
denies
a
man
fair
trial
and
if
the
legislature
produces
this
evidence
--
produces
the
statute
it
would
be
up
for
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
decide
it.
and
i
say
that
this
is
so
universally
acknowledge
that
this
evidence
bears
too
much
on
the
eyes
of
the
jury
that
they
cannot
separate.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir,
a
copy
of
the
verdict
has
been
given
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
by
simple
mathematic
computation
that
the
person
wasn't
even
old.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
you
can't
go
back
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
the
question
is
was
he
convicted
before
he
was
even
making
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir.
the
indicted
them,
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
verdict.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
the
question
was
if
there
were
or
were
not
mitigating
circumstances
as
to
first
conviction
that
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
court
or
the
jury
at
the
second
time.
the
question
has
he
been
convicted
before
if
he
had
received
just
two
years
conviction,
he
would
still
receive
the
maximum,
i
mean
the
minimum
penalty
of
life
in
the
second
conviction.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
with
an
alternate
punishment
of
the
crime.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
any
crime
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
first
one
was
murder
with
malice,
now
the
state
attempts
to
say
that
there
are
fair
things
in
the
federal,
there
are
unfair
things
in
the
state
but
the
federal
rule
provides
them
the
ruled
32
(c)
(2)
as
to
the
defendant
not
being
able
to
see
the
pre-sentence
report
and
i
believe
there
is
a
longer
report
and
a
shorter
report
of
summary
in
the
federal
court.
i
believe
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
see
it
but
the
state
has
not
mentioned
in
the
preceding
section
32
(c-1)
specifically
states
that
the
pre-sentencing
report
shall
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
for
contents
thereof
disclosed
to
anyone
until
after
the
defendant
has
plead
guilty
or
has
been
founded.
then
we
come
back
to
the
mention
of
the
narcotics
act
and
i
may
be
incorrect
with
my
research
shows
that
title
26
section
7237
as
to
the
penalty
on
narcotics
provides
that
after
the
conviction
of
the
first
--
conviction
on
the
primary
offense
that
court
has
been
informed
as
to
this
man's
status
as
to
the
first
conviction
and
said
that
a
federal
judge
in
a
very
well
reasoned
opinion,
haggard
versus
the
state
of
tennessee
that
the
threat
of
prejudice
is
inseparable
from
such
a
procedure.
a
threat
so
real,
so
ever
pressed
and
so
immune
from
judicial
review
in
correction
and
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
present
day
conceptions
of
the
degree
of
fairness
requiring
in
criminal
proceedings.
they
are
--
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
because
of
this
from
the
beginning
to
end
it
is
just
--
the
state
has
put
the
burden
on
him
of
an
evil
character
and
he
is
endeavored
from
beginning
to
end
to
try
him
for
the
first
crime
and
not
the
second.
the
state
in
its
brief
has
said
that
the
facts
were
overwhelming
against
leon
spencer
and
that
no
fair-minded
jury
could
reach
any
other
verdict.
well
if
this
be
true,
then
it's
all
of
the
more
reason
that
that
this
mean
should
receive
such
a
trial
that
would
be
fair
and
impartial
and
that
there
would
be
no
possible
threat
whatsoever
of
any
degree
of
unreasonableness
and
risk
of
harm
to
this
man.
now,
we
come
back
to
what
if
a
jury
in
such
a
case
believes
that
he's
not
the
same
man
and
for
the
some
reason
the
first
conviction
is
constitutionally
invalid.
what
do
we
come
back
to
then?
we
come
back
to
the
idea
that
is
not
admissible
for
any
purpose
and
you've
injected
in
front
of
the
jury
any
visible
testimony
that's
not
admissible
for
any
purpose
whatsoever.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
mine
was
under
article
64
which
provides
that
in
a
case
of
the
accusation
that
carries
a
capital
punishment,
if
such
a
person
has
been
previously
convicted
for
the
alternate
punishment
could
be
a
capital
punishment
that
he
shall
receive
not
less
than
life
or
death
in
the
electric
chair.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir.
this
goes
back
in
the
state
of
texas
at
about
1836.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
my
personal
opinion
sir
is
that
in
--
the
state
of
texas
says
in
its
brief
and
his
attorney
is
the
attorney
for
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
is
upon
appellate
lawyers
we
had
in
texas,
he
has
not
been
charged.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
that's
my
feeling
your
honor
but
i
am
probably
incorrect
i
guess
because
he
knows
more
about
the
criminal
law
in
texas
than
i
do.
but
this
is
just
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
rojas
case
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
entirely
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
just
have
one
two
other
remarks.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
your
honor,
the
main
comment
that
i
would
have,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
fact
that
we
are
not
dealing
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
for
the
case
of
isolating
significance
of
the
rule
of
evidence.
what
we're
dealing
with
is,
does
this
man
have
the
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
before
a
fair
and
impartial
jury?
and
if
any
proceedings
that
occurs
in
the
state
court
that
denies
a
man
a
fair
trial,
would
this
be
propensity
of
bribing
jurors,
people
crying
in
the
courtroom,
anything
that
would
have
for
the
admission
of
evidence
that
would
be
such
as
to
keep
the
jury
from
coming
to
a
conclusion
where
then
fair
conclusion
based
upon
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
he
is
denied
a
fair
trial.
and
then
therefore,
what
we
are
asking
in
this
case
as
in
the
leon
spencer
is
he
be
given
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
jury
on
the
question
of
his
guilty
or
innocence.
and
it's
not
a
--
particularly
a
question
of
whether
this
being
an
evidence
should
be
admitted
or
not.
but
the
question
is,
after
it
has
been
admitted,
is
it
such
that
it
is
rendered
an
impossibility
for
this
man
to
have
a
fair
trial?
and
this
judge
vegas
has
said
in
the
case
of
united
states
vs.
banmiller
on
exactly
the
same
point.
in
respect
to
the
virtual
criminal
statutes
and
their
applicability,
we
point
out
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
distance.
the
danger
resulting
from
prejudice
is
always
enhanced
on
a
capital
case,
fashion
drawn
high
in
the
penalty
is
irreversible.
certainly
such
a
feed
to
psychological
wizardry
verges
on
the
possibility,
impossibility
even
for
broke
judges.
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
could
have
been
accomplished
by
twelve
men
brought
together
as
a
jury.
the
impropriety
of
the
pennsylvania
practice
demonstrated
by
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
so
gross
in
results
in
such
fundamental
unfairness
is
to
constitute
the
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
sir,
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that,
mr.
fortas,
this
court
and
the
constitution
is
concerned,
perhaps,
it
would
be
a
lawful
state
matter
to
take
up
man's
pass
record
to
apply
to
what
punishment
society
should
inflict
on
him.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
to
decide
what
punishment,
after
he
has
been
found
guilty,
that
society
should
inflict
to
him.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
sir,
it
comes
back
to
you
and
in
my
personal
opinion,
i
think
that
it
would
because
you
cannot
enhance
that.
once
you
are
dead
and
the
state
has
executed
this
man,
it's
over.
and
as
far
as
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
itself,
had
taken
another
man's
life
away
uplifted,
it
should
be
done
on
the
basis
of
the
severity
of
the
charged
crime.
but
as
the
general
proposition
as
to
state's
right
to
inflict
a
heavier
punishment
less
than
death
for
the
repetition
of
crime
not
connected
in
--
prejudicing
the
jury
on
the
question
of
guilt
of
innocence,
that's
a
different
matter.
and
that's
where
our
draw
that
distinctions
perhaps
of
law
without
having
to
be
truthful
with
the
court.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
what
i'm
attempting
to
say
is
that
i
believe
personally
that
when
the
death
penalty
can
be
inflicted
that
you
should
even
asked
to
the
punishment.
it
should
be
limited
as
to
what
the
man
is
charged
with
this
time.
but
if
you
are
going
to
take
another
man's
life
away,
it
should
be
done
on
the
basis
of
the
charged
crime
-
as
to
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
as
to
his
punishment.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
you
mean
bad
things
and
the
good?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
in
the
state
of
texas,
it's
only
a
jury
can
inflict
a
death
penalty.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
perhaps,
it's
good
because
even
a
judge,
i
believe,
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
set
aside
this
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
punishment
should
be
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
those
were
not
the
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
my
argument
today,
we're
talking
about
the
policy
question
that
you
just
asked
me
or
we're
talking
about
the
case
of
leon
spencer
in
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
as
to
the
question
of
the
man's
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
main
trial,
i
think
there
should
be
no
distinction
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
none
whatever.
because
it
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
because
i
believe
the
differences
is
not
this
court
deciding
what
policy
of
the
state
may
use
as
to
the
rules
of
evidence
but
if
the
tom
(inaudible)
effects
of
admitting
this
evidence,
as
such
is
to
deny
a
man
a
fair
trial,
it
must
fall
under
the
sixth
amendment.
and,
i
believe
this
is
encouraged
here
because
of
the
accumulation
of
all
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence
that
courts
thereafter
argues
previously
said,
why
it's
too
heavily
on
deciding
a
man's
guilt
or
innocence
based
on
the
primary
jeopardy.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
the
record
–
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
he'd
been
convicted
of
one
crime
before
but
this
–
the
evidence
of
this
one
kind
came
in
from
the
very
beginning
in
the
voir
dire
to
the
judges
charged
in,
certified
copies
of
the
record
plus
two
live
witnesses
to
testify
on
this
the
same
man
who
sit
on
the
same
chair
and
who
was
convicted
by
another
jury
in
the
same
jury
about
15
years
before.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir,
it's
right.
but
sitting
here
listening
to
what
he
said
(inaudible).
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
that's
right,
sir--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
i'm
sorry.
voir
dire,
the
state's
position
was
explained
to
the
jury
–
they
did
not
say
it
is
a
fact
but
they
said
it's
our
opinion
that
the
evidence
would
show
this
and
therefore
he
has
punishment.
the
indictment
was
read
to
the
jury
on
the
primary
charge
which
included
the
going
back
into
the
repetitions,
your
honor.
a
certified
copy
of
the
previous
indictment
along
with
the
jury's
verdict,
along
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
sentencing
the
man,
was
introduced.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
except
to
the
fact
of
the
indictment
read
that
the
man
killed
this
other
woman
with
a
knife.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
because
you
have
to
give
notices
to
have
that
in
indictment
plus
the
fact,
besides
the
picture
with
a
number
across
these
chairs.
in
the
prison
--
the
records
of
his
finger
prints
there
were
two
live
police
witnesses
to
testify
that
they
were
present
on
the
same
courtroom
that
witness
the
same
man
convicted
before
in
the
same
courtroom
15
years
ago.
plus,
when
we
got
through
with
the
case,
besides
the
state
argument
as
to
what
punishment
should
be
inflicted,
the
charge
to
the
jury,
which
is
a
part
of
the
transcript
to
wit,
specifically
made
to
the
jury
found
that
he
was
the
man,
that
the
man
convicted
before.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
defendant
in
this
case
leon
spencer
was
charged
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
article
64
with
the
offense
of
murder
with
malice
and
murder
with
malice
reputation.
he
was
charged
with
the
offense
of
murdering
with
malice,
his
common-law
wife
lavinia
erdie.
the
reputation
for
it
of
the
indictment
charge
at
some
15
years
prior
to
this
that
he
had
been
convicted
in
the
same
courtroom
of
the
offense
of
murder
with
malice
of
the
former
wife.
not
the
same
wife
sir.
the
defendant
from
the
very
beginning,
i
tried
this
case
on
the
trial
court
level
and
recognized
the
problem
that
this
man
would
have
on
trial
for
his
wife
to
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
from
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
of
murder
with
malice.
attempts
were
made
before
the
trial
actually
even
began
or
before
any
juror
were
questioned
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
this
prior
evidence
because
under
article
64,
it
was
not
admissible
for
any
purpose
except
in
the
situation
when
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
with
malice
and
the
jury
in
this
case
found
this
defendant
guilty
of
only
murder
without
malice
under
the
applicable
texas
cases
the
first
conviction
would
have
been
inadmissible
for
any
purpose.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir,
not
in
the
state
of
texas,
it
would
not
and
it
was
ruled
inadmissible
by
the
trial
court.
this
is
taken
out
of
context.
it's
not
in
the
printed
record
and
if
a
close
check
is
made
on
the
certified
record,
he
would
repeal
that
an
objection
was
made
because
this
was
testimony
put
up
by
the
state
by
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
woman
and
was
in
regards
to
testimony
that
occurred
three
years
before
this
woman
was
killed
or
said
to
be
killed.
three
years
before
in
the
trial
court
rule
that
it
was
entirely
too
remote
and
should
not
be
considered
for
any
purpose.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
baker
versus
states
is
the
testimony
of
threatening
and
in
that
case
the
trial
court
ruled
that
it
was
admissible.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
the
trial
court
in
the
trial
of
this
case
decided
what
the
law
is
in
the
state
of
texas
decided
that
this
was
too
remote
and
was
not
admissible
and
this
would
be
a
threat
and
not
a
prior
conviction
of
murder
with
malice.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
the
defendant
further
entered
into
a
judicial
stipulation
that
he
was
the
same
individual
that
have
been
convicted
before
and
further
that
for
the
first
conviction
was
constitutionally
valid
and
there
was
nothing
for
the
jury
to
decide
before
they
determined
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
this
was
overruled.
now,
when
it
falls
down
to
this
court
although
i
recognize
the
distinction
that
mr.
justice
black
is
making
and
what
he
is
saying
about
with
the
marshall
case
and
supervisory
powers
of
this
court
over
the
federal
court
but
we
have
up
here
is
a
man
is
being
tried
for
his
very
life.
and
this
goes
beyond
the
rules
of
evidence
of
a
blurting
out
of
a
witness
that
there
has
been
a
prior
conviction.
this
exaggerates
the
entire
fact-finding
procedure
guilt
or
innocence
of
this
man.
when
he
went
all
the
way
back
to
the
questioning
of
each
individual
juror
who
finally
set
up
a
jury
it
was
explained
to
them
that
the
state
was
contending
in
this
very
courtroom
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
a
murder
before.
this
was
read
to
him
from
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
when
a
complete
wide
of
reason,
yes
sir.
the
reason
that
i
would
say
this
is
unconstitutional
goes
back
to
what
this
court
says
on
due
process,
in
betts
versus
brady
as
to
the
situation
of
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
betts
versus
brady
what
would
constitute
the
due
process
in
one
case
might
not
in
another.
and
this
goes
further
than
this
court
saying
to
the
states
what
is
fair,
there
is
fair
way,
not
what
is
a
fair
and
what
is
fair.
i
am
saying
that
when
a
man
is
on
trial
for
his
life
the
effect
he
was
tried
for
this
first
conviction
that
half
of
the
proofs
put
on
by
the
state
went
to
the
first
conviction.
that
each
juror
has
been
told
he's
been
convicted
before
that
the
indictment
signed
by
a
grand
jury
was
introduced
into
evidence
as
the
first
court
has
been
approved
by
the
state
the
certified
copy
which
in
the
former
case
the
state
said
was
not
admissible.
the
certified
copy
was
admitted.
the
verdict
of
the
prior
jury
was
admitted
showing
that
he
had
been
convicted.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no
sir
it
comes
back
as
to
in
this
line
of
reasoning
i
still
believe
that
the
main
issue
was
whether
man
has
been
denied
of
fair
and
impartial
jury
and
not
as
a
rule
of
evidence
of
one
thing
in
that
there
has
been
--
has
there
been
in
this
matter
this
individual
case
of
this
man
charged
with
a
capital
offense
of
continuing
and
continuing
and
continuing
and
continuing,
going
into
this
again
and
again
two
live
witnesses
who
testified
they
were
present
before
and
he
was
the
same
man
and
the
same
courtroom
that
was
convicted
introducing
a
picture
of
them
with
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
if
it
is
admissible,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
it
is
not
admissible.
what
i
was
saying
is
this
court
has
have
then
when
we
go
into
past
opinions
that
the
jury
should
enter
into
a
jury
box
with
a
clear
mind.
the
behavioral
scientist
call
this
something
called
tabula
rasa,
it
means,
i
may
not
pronounce
this
correctly.
meaning
a
clean
slate,
that
they
have
no
fixed
opinion
as
to
this
man's
guilt
or
innocence
and
the
state
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
first
murder
was
a
conviction
15
years
before
the
murder
of
the
former
wife.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
his
then
wife,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
his
charge
was
to
the
conviction,
was
a
charge
of
murdering
another
wife.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
except
mr.
justice
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
black
i
believe
the
people
who
that
studied
the
civilizations
of
the
world
had
stated
that
each
culture
is
determined
by
the
guarantees
that
it
gives
to
each
individual
person
no
matter
what
type
of
person
he
is,
what
type
of
evil
may
he
is
or
what
he
has
been
involved
before
and
under
our
constitution
you
are
entitled
to
have
an
impartial
finding
by
an
impartial
jury
from
the
basis
of
what
you're
charged
with
this
time
that
just
because
you've
done
something
before
is
no
evidence
that
you've
done
it
this
time.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir,
it
is
none.
and
the
reason
again,
does
this
procedure
prevent
the
probability
of
unfairness?
i
say
not
only
does
it
not
prevent
the
probability
of
unfairness,
it
fosters
unfairness.
the
--
i
have
been
unable
to
find
one
case
and
i
am
not
saying
there
are
no
cases
like
this
mentioned
before.
i
have
been
able
to
find
no
case
and
the
state
in
its
brief
has
cited
no
case.
it
states
that
this
prior
conviction
was
admissible
for
the
purpose
showing
a
man
propensity
for
trial.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
first
murder
was
convicted
by
this
man
stabbing
the
woman
in
the
neck.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
second
murder
was
convicted
by
this
man
shooting
his
wife
in
the
head
as
to
what
the
facts
alleged
by
the
statute.
it
came
--
but
it
still
comes
back
to
this
man
as
entitled
to
have
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
primary
offense
and
that
the
courts
have
held
that
this
testimony
override,
it's
so
overwhelming
in
the
average
person's
mind
that
would
sit
upon
a
jury
that
he
could
not
separate.
and
in
texas,
it
would
not
have
been
admissible
for
any
purposes
other
than
to
accept
the
punishment
of
the
defendant.
this
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
texas
has
held
that
in
another
habitual
criminal
offense
when
you
have
a
non-capital
prior
offense
and
a
charge
capital
offense
that
you
could
not
combine
because
it
is
unfair
to
do
so
because
this
would
overweigh
with
the
jury
and
they
would
not
be
able
to
have
a
impartial
jury
under
the
terms
of
provision
to
the
sixth
amendment
and
they
reverse
such
a
case.
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
in
any
jurisdiction
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
united
states
has
this
prove
been
introduced
in
any
other
case
except
in
habitual
criminal
situations.
if
he
had
been
charged
with
running
a
stop
sign,
with
speeding,
with
parking
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
the
court
would
say
that
this
evidence
is
not
admissible
to
show
his
propensity
of
the
crime
in
the
so
overwhelming
it
is
prejudicial.
and
that
in
the
state
of
texas
had
he
been
charged
--
with
his
--
haven't
been
convicted
once
before,
haven't
been
charged
on
any
other
crime,
any
other
crime
on
the
trial
of
that
same
courtroom
for
running
a
red
light,
for
running
a
stop
sign,
this
evidence
would
not
have
been
admissible
and
court
would
say
if
you
did,
if
it's
so
overbearing
that
you
could
not
get
an
impartial
jury.
so
it
falls
down
to
this,
can
we
have
two
standards
for
what
an
impartial
hearing
is.
a
person
that's
been
involved
with
a
crime
that
the
state
says
that
we're
going
to
show
this
time
that
he
be
denied
an
impartial
hearing
should
he
be
denied
comes
back
in
not
one
case
studied
by
the
state
as
the
court
has
sustained
the
state's
position
giving
any
reason
for
doing
so
except
because
the
state
in
its
prior
argument
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
did
not
answer
what
is
the
basis,
what
necessity
is
there
for
confusing
the
jury
and
prejudicing
the
jury
with
the
existence
of
the
prior
conviction
before
the
determination
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
and
the
answer
is
there
is
no
necessity
this
is
known
throughout
the
state
of
texas
as
the
prosecutor's
door.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
prosecutor's
door.
and
many
people
had
been
convicted
on
slim
facts
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
because
there
is
no
way
to
tell.
you
can't
go
back
into
the
juror
line.
but
how
many
weak
facts
where
the
determination
and
it's
the
burden
on
the
state
to
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
based
on
moral
certainty
that
this
man's
action
that
resulted
in
the
crime.
it
resulted
on
the
guilt
because
of
that
overriding
fact,
the
procedure
that
we
have
in
texas
now
according
to
the
state's
attorney
in
every
case
besides
the
capital
case.
i
have
read
the
roxas
case
and
i
disagree.
that's
a
concurring
opinion
that
talks
about
--
that
case,
i
don't
believe
that
has
been
cited
by
the
court.
but
it
comes
back
to
makes
it
even
more
important
if
it's
still
there
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir,
it
is
not
they
are
more
likely
to
commit
a
third
and
what
i
have
read
about
it
is
your
honor,
that
the
state
is
taking
crimes
for
which
the
punishment
for
a
first
defense
should
not
be
but
five
years
based
upon
the
theory
which
probably
is
incorrect
that
you
should
make
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
and
that
consciously
or
conscientiously
the
state
cannot
inflict
a
punishment
for
the
primary
offense
of
stealing
a
car
of
the
maximum
of
10
years
in
the
penitentiary
and
on
the
third
time
if
a
man
steals
a
car
again
that
for
the
primary
offense
that
they
cannot
consciously
again
make
a
punishment
of
life
for
stealing
an
automobile
then
therefore
when
a
man
has
done
it
three
times
that
they
are
trying
to
make
an
additional
burden
on
this
person
not
to
create
an
additional
punishment
for
this
individual
but
all
of
these
does
not
go
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
i
am
sorry.
i
believe
they
pose
a
greater
sense
for
an
individual
on
the
third
theft
to
punish
that
individual
because
he
cannot
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
what
it.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir
because
(voice
overlap).
no
sir
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
believe
that
that
may
be
perhaps
relevant
but
that
may
be
relevant.
i
would
think
in
that,
that's
the
whole
basis
of
the
whole
--
of
the
contention
here
mr.
justice
black
is
that
because
of
human
nature
i
personally
would
think
that
a
man
that
has
been
involved
with
a
trouble
with
the
law
before
is
the
type
of
person
that
would
be
involved
and
has
trouble
with
the
law.
but
our
system
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
because
of
the
reason
that
this
would
overbear
so
much
for
the
jury
that
it
would
cloud
their
mind
so
much
that
the
average
juror
or
the
average
judge
or
the
most
educated
attorney
could
not
completely
separate
this
man
this
from
his
mind
and
only
use
it
to
determine
the
punishment
to
be
inflicted.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir.
it
comes
back
to
--
if
these
were
an
isolated
instance
in
trial
of
the
rule
of
evidence
and
whether
this
particular
piece
could
come
in
that
would
be
one.
but
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
from
beginning
to
end,
his
trial
was
such
that
he
did
not
receive
due
process
of
law
that
the
standards
that
our
constitution
required
and
that's
i
can
see
and
what
you're
saying
mr.
justice
black
i
realize
you're
saying
that
although
it
may
be
unfair
to
do
this
wherein
the
constitution
doesn't
say
you
can.
but
i
am
saying
is
that
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
man
did
not
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
before
a
fair
and
trial
impartial
jury
because
of
the
accumulation
of
all
these
evidence
being
introduced
for
no
other
purpose
than
decide
his
punishment
and
this
will
not
come
into
play
to
the
defending
guilty
of
murder
with
malice.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
if
the
legislators
or
attorneys
and
people
well-versed
in
either
human
nature
in
the
trial
of
lawsuits
it
should
be
the
legislature.
i
would
be
the
first
person
to
say
that
the
offense
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
but
he
comes
back
to
all
of
these
people
and
all
what
the
jurisdiction
says
because
of
what
makes
the
common
person
take
that
this
evidence
weigh
so
heavily
that
a
person
accused
of
crime
cannot
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
state
of
texas
has
stated
that
such
evidence
denies
the
person
of
a
fair
trial
and
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
the
courts
have
said
that
such
evidence
denies
a
man
fair
trial
and
if
the
legislature
produces
this
evidence
--
produces
the
statute
it
would
be
up
for
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
decide
it.
and
i
say
that
this
is
so
universally
acknowledge
that
this
evidence
bears
too
much
on
the
eyes
of
the
jury
that
they
cannot
separate.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir,
a
copy
of
the
verdict
has
been
given
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
by
simple
mathematic
computation
that
the
person
wasn't
even
old.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
you
can't
go
back
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
but
the
question
is
was
he
convicted
before
he
was
even
making
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir.
the
indicted
them,
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
verdict.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir
the
question
was
if
there
were
or
were
not
mitigating
circumstances
as
to
first
conviction
that
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
court
or
the
jury
at
the
second
time.
the
question
has
he
been
convicted
before
if
he
had
received
just
two
years
conviction,
he
would
still
receive
the
maximum,
i
mean
the
minimum
penalty
of
life
in
the
second
conviction.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
with
an
alternate
punishment
of
the
crime.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
any
crime
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
the
first
one
was
murder
with
malice,
now
the
state
attempts
to
say
that
there
are
fair
things
in
the
federal,
there
are
unfair
things
in
the
state
but
the
federal
rule
provides
them
the
ruled
32
(c)
(2)
as
to
the
defendant
not
being
able
to
see
the
pre-sentence
report
and
i
believe
there
is
a
longer
report
and
a
shorter
report
of
summary
in
the
federal
court.
i
believe
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
see
it
but
the
state
has
not
mentioned
in
the
preceding
section
32
(c-1)
specifically
states
that
the
pre-sentencing
report
shall
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
for
contents
thereof
disclosed
to
anyone
until
after
the
defendant
has
plead
guilty
or
has
been
founded.
then
we
come
back
to
the
mention
of
the
narcotics
act
and
i
may
be
incorrect
with
my
research
shows
that
title
26
section
7237
as
to
the
penalty
on
narcotics
provides
that
after
the
conviction
of
the
first
--
conviction
on
the
primary
offense
that
court
has
been
informed
as
to
this
man's
status
as
to
the
first
conviction
and
said
that
a
federal
judge
in
a
very
well
reasoned
opinion,
haggard
versus
the
state
of
tennessee
that
the
threat
of
prejudice
is
inseparable
from
such
a
procedure.
a
threat
so
real,
so
ever
pressed
and
so
immune
from
judicial
review
in
correction
and
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
present
day
conceptions
of
the
degree
of
fairness
requiring
in
criminal
proceedings.
they
are
--
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
because
of
this
from
the
beginning
to
end
it
is
just
--
the
state
has
put
the
burden
on
him
of
an
evil
character
and
he
is
endeavored
from
beginning
to
end
to
try
him
for
the
first
crime
and
not
the
second.
the
state
in
its
brief
has
said
that
the
facts
were
overwhelming
against
leon
spencer
and
that
no
fair-minded
jury
could
reach
any
other
verdict.
well
if
this
be
true,
then
it's
all
of
the
more
reason
that
that
this
mean
should
receive
such
a
trial
that
would
be
fair
and
impartial
and
that
there
would
be
no
possible
threat
whatsoever
of
any
degree
of
unreasonableness
and
risk
of
harm
to
this
man.
now,
we
come
back
to
what
if
a
jury
in
such
a
case
believes
that
he's
not
the
same
man
and
for
the
some
reason
the
first
conviction
is
constitutionally
invalid.
what
do
we
come
back
to
then?
we
come
back
to
the
idea
that
is
not
admissible
for
any
purpose
and
you've
injected
in
front
of
the
jury
any
visible
testimony
that's
not
admissible
for
any
purpose
whatsoever.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
mine
was
under
article
64
which
provides
that
in
a
case
of
the
accusation
that
carries
a
capital
punishment,
if
such
a
person
has
been
previously
convicted
for
the
alternate
punishment
could
be
a
capital
punishment
that
he
shall
receive
not
less
than
life
or
death
in
the
electric
chair.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes
sir.
this
goes
back
in
the
state
of
texas
at
about
1836.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
my
personal
opinion
sir
is
that
in
--
the
state
of
texas
says
in
its
brief
and
his
attorney
is
the
attorney
for
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
is
upon
appellate
lawyers
we
had
in
texas,
he
has
not
been
charged.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
that's
my
feeling
your
honor
but
i
am
probably
incorrect
i
guess
because
he
knows
more
about
the
criminal
law
in
texas
than
i
do.
but
this
is
just
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
rojas
case
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
entirely
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
i
just
have
one
two
other
remarks.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
your
honor,
the
main
comment
that
i
would
have,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
fact
that
we
are
not
dealing
in
the
case
of
leon
spencer
for
the
case
of
isolating
significance
of
the
rule
of
evidence.
what
we're
dealing
with
is,
does
this
man
have
the
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
before
a
fair
and
impartial
jury?
and
if
any
proceedings
that
occurs
in
the
state
court
that
denies
a
man
a
fair
trial,
would
this
be
propensity
of
bribing
jurors,
people
crying
in
the
courtroom,
anything
that
would
have
for
the
admission
of
evidence
that
would
be
such
as
to
keep
the
jury
from
coming
to
a
conclusion
where
then
fair
conclusion
based
upon
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
he
is
denied
a
fair
trial.
and
then
therefore,
what
we
are
asking
in
this
case
as
in
the
leon
spencer
is
he
be
given
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
jury
on
the
question
of
his
guilty
or
innocence.
and
it's
not
a
--
particularly
a
question
of
whether
this
being
an
evidence
should
be
admitted
or
not.
but
the
question
is,
after
it
has
been
admitted,
is
it
such
that
it
is
rendered
an
impossibility
for
this
man
to
have
a
fair
trial?
and
this
judge
vegas
has
said
in
the
case
of
united
states
vs.
banmiller
on
exactly
the
same
point.
in
respect
to
the
virtual
criminal
statutes
and
their
applicability,
we
point
out
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
distance.
the
danger
resulting
from
prejudice
is
always
enhanced
on
a
capital
case,
fashion
drawn
high
in
the
penalty
is
irreversible.
certainly
such
a
feed
to
psychological
wizardry
verges
on
the
possibility,
impossibility
even
for
broke
judges.
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
could
have
been
accomplished
by
twelve
men
brought
together
as
a
jury.
the
impropriety
of
the
pennsylvania
practice
demonstrated
by
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
so
gross
in
results
in
such
fundamental
unfairness
is
to
constitute
the
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
sir,
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that,
mr.
fortas,
this
court
and
the
constitution
is
concerned,
perhaps,
it
would
be
a
lawful
state
matter
to
take
up
man's
pass
record
to
apply
to
what
punishment
society
should
inflict
on
him.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
to
decide
what
punishment,
after
he
has
been
found
guilty,
that
society
should
inflict
to
him.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
sir,
it
comes
back
to
you
and
in
my
personal
opinion,
i
think
that
it
would
because
you
cannot
enhance
that.
once
you
are
dead
and
the
state
has
executed
this
man,
it's
over.
and
as
far
as
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
itself,
had
taken
another
man's
life
away
uplifted,
it
should
be
done
on
the
basis
of
the
severity
of
the
charged
crime.
but
as
the
general
proposition
as
to
state's
right
to
inflict
a
heavier
punishment
less
than
death
for
the
repetition
of
crime
not
connected
in
--
prejudicing
the
jury
on
the
question
of
guilt
of
innocence,
that's
a
different
matter.
and
that's
where
our
draw
that
distinctions
perhaps
of
law
without
having
to
be
truthful
with
the
court.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
what
i'm
attempting
to
say
is
that
i
believe
personally
that
when
the
death
penalty
can
be
inflicted
that
you
should
even
asked
to
the
punishment.
it
should
be
limited
as
to
what
the
man
is
charged
with
this
time.
but
if
you
are
going
to
take
another
man's
life
away,
it
should
be
done
on
the
basis
of
the
charged
crime
-
as
to
his
guilt
or
innocence
and
as
to
his
punishment.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
you
mean
bad
things
and
the
good?
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
in
the
state
of
texas,
it's
only
a
jury
can
inflict
a
death
penalty.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
perhaps,
it's
good
because
even
a
judge,
i
believe,
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
set
aside
this
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
punishment
should
be
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
those
were
not
the
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
no,
sir.
my
argument
today,
we're
talking
about
the
policy
question
that
you
just
asked
me
or
we're
talking
about
the
case
of
leon
spencer
in
--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
as
to
the
question
of
the
man's
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
main
trial,
i
think
there
should
be
no
distinction
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
none
whatever.
because
it
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
because
i
believe
the
differences
is
not
this
court
deciding
what
policy
of
the
state
may
use
as
to
the
rules
of
evidence
but
if
the
tom
(inaudible)
effects
of
admitting
this
evidence,
as
such
is
to
deny
a
man
a
fair
trial,
it
must
fall
under
the
sixth
amendment.
and,
i
believe
this
is
encouraged
here
because
of
the
accumulation
of
all
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence
that
courts
thereafter
argues
previously
said,
why
it's
too
heavily
on
deciding
a
man's
guilt
or
innocence
based
on
the
primary
jeopardy.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir.
the
record
–
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
he'd
been
convicted
of
one
crime
before
but
this
–
the
evidence
of
this
one
kind
came
in
from
the
very
beginning
in
the
voir
dire
to
the
judges
charged
in,
certified
copies
of
the
record
plus
two
live
witnesses
to
testify
on
this
the
same
man
who
sit
on
the
same
chair
and
who
was
convicted
by
another
jury
in
the
same
jury
about
15
years
before.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
sir,
it's
right.
but
sitting
here
listening
to
what
he
said
(inaudible).
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
that's
right,
sir--
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
well,
i'm
sorry.
voir
dire,
the
state's
position
was
explained
to
the
jury
–
they
did
not
say
it
is
a
fact
but
they
said
it's
our
opinion
that
the
evidence
would
show
this
and
therefore
he
has
punishment.
the
indictment
was
read
to
the
jury
on
the
primary
charge
which
included
the
going
back
into
the
repetitions,
your
honor.
a
certified
copy
of
the
previous
indictment
along
with
the
jury's
verdict,
along
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
sentencing
the
man,
was
introduced.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
except
to
the
fact
of
the
indictment
read
that
the
man
killed
this
other
woman
with
a
knife.
mr.
michael
d.
matheny
yes,
because
you
have
to
give
notices
to
have
that
in
indictment
plus
the
fact,
besides
the
picture
with
a
number
across
these
chairs.
in
the
prison
--
the
records
of
his
finger
prints
there
were
two
live
police
witnesses
to
testify
that
they
were
present
on
the
same
courtroom
that
witness
the
same
man
convicted
before
in
the
same
courtroom
15
years
ago.
plus,
when
we
got
through
with
the
case,
besides
the
state
argument
as
to
what
punishment
should
be
inflicted,
the
charge
to
the
jury,
which
is
a
part
of
the
transcript
to
wit,
specifically
made
to
the
jury
found
that
he
was
the
man,
that
the
man
convicted
before.
