(inaudible),
i

texas
is

justice

no

made?
justice

are
the

provided

justice

black
yes,
on
the
relevancy
of

on

conviction.
justice

black
but
aren't
the
same
state,
rule
differently?
don't
we
have
some
other
cases
here
in
the
united
states
that
is
so
different?
isn't
that
a
question
of
the
law
what
the
law
should
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
evidence
was
he
admissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
of
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
aside
from
due
process
you
rely
on
and
say
that
that
is
inadmissible
evidence
constitutionally
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
aside
from
due

you
rely?
what
specific
one
that
points
that
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
says
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
right
to
an
impartial
tribunal
but
does
that
say
anything
about
the
right
to
what
evidence
will
be
admitted
or
denied
against
it?
justice
hugo

black
is
it
your
argument
that
a
rule
of

which
pass
by
legislative
by
department
which
said
that
that
evidence
would
be
admissible
is
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
any

he
didn't
like?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
those
that's
making
into
a
pattern
of
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
so
that
it's
a
question
of
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
of
policy
what
should
be
the
law.
justice
hugo

black
you
claim
that
we
have
the

in
this
court
to
determine
this

of

on
the
basis
of
whether
we
think
it
goes
just
a
little
too
far
or
just
not
quite
far
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
provision
of
the
constitution
on
which
you
can
rely
to
your
argument
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
rely
on
the
sixth.
the
sixth
says,
“tried
before
an
impartial
tribunal.”
would
the
tribunal
be
impartial
because
of
the
evidences
offered
or
because
of
some
inherent
prejudice
on
his
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
said
alleging
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
there
are
many
people
that
could
think
that
is
admissible
evidence.
those
are
not,
thinking
with
reference
to
many
crimes
that
are
familiar.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
us
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
on
the
basis
of
such
shadowy
reliance
as
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
isn't
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
people
who
commits
crime
allows
them
to
commit
other
crimes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
thing
can
be
argued
why
shouldn't
we
leave
it
up
to
the
legislative
body
to
decide
that
question
of
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
affecting
the
constitutionality,
are
we
not,
should
we
not
be
compelled?
to
look
for
the
reasons
that
might
uphold
the
law
rather
than
to
seek
reasons
it
might
take
advantage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
any
states
held
that
that
does
violate
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
when
was
that
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
first
time
it
was
ever
been
held
in
this
country?
justice
hugo

black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
ever
been
held
before
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
talking
about
on
the
written
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
judgment.
why
can't
a
legislative
body
think
that
it
is
relevant
and
is
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
you
think
it's
a
fair
way
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
not
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
a
policy
on
overweighing
the
policy
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
none
of
the
states
since
the
beginning
of
this
government
have
held
that
this
evidence
could
be
admitted,
there
is
relevance
to
show
the
propensity
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
it's
you
know
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
truthful
reputation
as
the
man
retrieve
his
character
has
been
lawless?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
truth
when
and
then
he
state
the
fact,
the
defendant's
general
reputation
has
been
on
the
lawless
character?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
do
you
say
that
we
have
withheld
as
constitutional
impermissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
character,
you
mean
of
lawlessness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
admissible
in
nearly
all
the
states
of
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
general
rule
not
the
constitutional
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
guarantee
is
another
thing;
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
federal
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it?
the
due
process
holding
of
law
is
unconstitutional
under
constitutional
claim
against
it
in
holding
that
this
court
is
--
was
called
at
supervisory
statute
federal
court
both
in
law
(inaudible)
does,
it's
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
constitution
prohibits
that
specifically.
they
could
have
it
specifically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there's
a
provision
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
should
be
tied
by
the
impartial
tribunal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
the
very
case
to
which
you
referred
michelson,
mr.
justice
jackson
referred
to
the
facts.
the
evidence
that
he
had
committed
many
crimes
might
be
persuasive
evidence
if
you
submitted
another
one
even
if
the
character
is
not
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
we're
talking
here
about
constitutional
rules
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say,
same
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
388.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that's
an
unreasonableness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
three
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
betts
versus
brady?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
an
idea
that
that
question
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
admissible,
why
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
--
what
was
the
first
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
wife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
they
offered
was
to
show
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
killing
wife
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
that
that's
unreasonable
to
offer
that
an
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
the
first
murder
committed
and
how
was
the
second
committed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
the
second
murder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
you
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
a
man
who
has
committed
a
number
of
crimes
that
commit
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
then
should
it
be
dealt
constitutionally
that
that
couldn't
be
offered
as
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
this
court
has
trouble
and
look
into
the
state
law
where
they
have
reason
that
can
offer
evidence
on
one
theory
on
another
theory
on
another
theory
and
reached
its
own
conclusion
that
they
ought
not
be
permitted
to
do
for
this
protection
constitutionally
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
it's
a
legislative
function
or
a
judicial
function
to
determine
that
we
in
different
policy
or
whatever
should
be
introduced
in
cases
aside
from
some
specific
constitutional
provisions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
is
a
legislative
function
or
a
judicial
function?
take
up
various
reasons
why
evidence
should
be
admitted
in
the
case,
is
it
a
judicial
function
basically
or
a
legislative
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
both
would
be
pretty
well-versed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
makes
the
common
person
safeguard
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
all
the
states
did
do
that
and
in
the
reason
for
the
federal
constitution
that
should
adopt
it
as
a
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you
to
say
you
are
mitigating
system?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
there's
an
impartial
jury
on
a
case
of
this
kind
is
because
there
has
been
a
mistake
made
in
the
introduction
of
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that's
the
kind
of
impartial
jury
that
is
spoken
of
in
the
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
complaining
about
is
that
a
jury
is
permitted
to
learn
that
the
man
who
is
on
the
trial
for
a
crime,
has
committed
crimes
before,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
counties
do
you
have
in
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
those
are
small
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
possible
to
have
a,
in
all
those
small
counties
all
over
the
united
states,
about
juries
“not
to
know”
something
about
the
past
life
of
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
you
disqualify
the
jurors
because
they
know
that
the
man
has
committed
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
not
kidding
(laughter).
i've
(inaudible)
to
the
fact
that
you
have
a
situation
here
which
you
know
as
the
law
accepts
and
jurors
are
supposed
to
know
that
that
life
of
the
man
is
on
trial.
here,
you
are
talking
about
a
policy
that's
wrong.
and
the
question
is,
are
you
going
to
the
right
tribunal
to
talk
about
that
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
came
from
a
small
county
in
alabama.
murders
that
have
been
committed
there
are
far
few
and
far
between.
everybody
knows
of
that.
all
the
jurors
know
that.
they
know
about
the
man
who
committed
it
and
worse
than
that.
what
would
you
do
in
a
county
like
that,
you
had
to
change
the
venue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
not
getting
away
from
the
word
“fact”
because
that's
an
abstract
word
which
is
not
in
the
constitution?
get
away
from
that
but
what
would
you
do
about
the
people
who
are
bound
to
know
that
this
man
committed
a
crime
before
and
have
been
in
the
penitentiary
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
they
will
find
out
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
know
he
has
committed
the
crime
and
he
has
suffered
the
penitentiary
sometime
before.
i've
known
many
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
don't
have
to
do
that
in
the
majority
of
counties
in
the
united
states
of
america
when
you
try
people
for
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
experience
as
a
lawyer
that
jurors
are
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
that
which
they
know
of
their
own
knowledge
in
the
past
and
by
that
which
was
offered
in
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
they
be
affected
if
they
just
do
it
from
the
outside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
gideon
vs.
wainwright,
we
were
concerned
with
the
fact
that
this
constitution
specifically
provides
that
a
man
should
have
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
then
use
the
word
“effective”
if
he
can't
request
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it's
wrong
for
the
jury
to
know
that
the
man
has
been
convicted
eight
times?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that's
constitutionally
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible),
i
mean
texas
is
--
justice

black
but
no

hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
judgment.
why
can't
a
legislative
body
think
that
it
is
relevant
and
is
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
you
think
it's
a
fair
way
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
not
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
a
policy
on
overweighing
the
policy
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
none
of
the
states
since
the
beginning
of
this
government
have
held
that
this
evidence
could
be
admitted,
there
is
relevance
to
show
the
propensity
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
it's
you
know
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
truthful
reputation
as
the
man
retrieve
his
character
has
been
lawless?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
truth
when
and
then
he
state
the
fact,
the
defendant's
general
reputation
has
been
on
the
lawless
character?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
do
you
say
that
we
have
withheld
as
constitutional
impermissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
character,
you
mean
of
lawlessness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
admissible
in
nearly
all
the
states
of
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
general
rule
not
the
constitutional
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
guarantee
is
another
thing;
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
federal
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it?
the
due
process
holding
of
law
is
unconstitutional
under
constitutional
claim
against
it
in
holding
that
this
court
is
--
was
called
at
supervisory
statute
federal
court
both
in
law
(inaudible)
does,
it's
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
constitution
prohibits
that
specifically.
they
could
have
it
specifically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there's
a
provision
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
should
be
tied
by
the
impartial
tribunal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
the
very
case
to
which
you
referred
michelson,
mr.
justice
jackson
referred
to
the
facts.
the
evidence
that
he
had
committed
many
crimes
might
be
persuasive
evidence
if
you
submitted
another
one
even
if
the
character
is
not
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
we're
talking
here
about
constitutional
rules
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say,
same
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
388.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that's
an
unreasonableness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
three
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
three
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
betts
versus
brady?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
an
idea
that
that
question
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
admissible,
why
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
--
what
was
the
first
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
wife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
they
offered
was
to
show
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
killing
wife
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
that
that's
unreasonable
to
offer
that
an
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
the
first
murder
committed
and
how
was
the
second
committed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
the
second
murder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
you
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
a
man
who
has
committed
a
number
of
crimes
that
commit
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
then
should
it
be
dealt
constitutionally
that
that
couldn't
be
offered
as
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
this
court
has
trouble
and
look
into
the
state
law
where
they
have
reason
that
can
offer
evidence
on
one
theory
on
another
theory
on
another
theory
and
reached
its
own
conclusion
that
they
ought
not
be
permitted
to
do
for
this
protection
constitutionally
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
it's
a
legislative
function
or
a
judicial
function
to
determine
that
we
in
different
policy
or
whatever
should
be
introduced
in
cases
aside
from
some
specific
constitutional
provisions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
is
a
legislative
function
or
a
judicial
function?
take
up
various
reasons
why
evidence
should
be
admitted
in
the
case,
is
it
a
judicial
function
basically
or
a
legislative
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
both
would
be
pretty
well-versed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
makes
the
common
person
safeguard
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
all
the
states
did
do
that
and
in
the
reason
for
the
federal
constitution
that
should
adopt
it
as
a
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you
to
say
you
are
mitigating
system?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
there's
an
impartial
jury
on
a
case
of
this
kind
is
because
there
has
been
a
mistake
made
in
the
introduction
of
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that's
the
kind
of
impartial
jury
that
is
spoken
of
in
the
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
complaining
about
is
that
a
jury
is
permitted
to
learn
that
the
man
who
is
on
the
trial
for
a
crime,
has
committed
crimes
before,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
counties
do
you
have
in
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
those
are
small
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
possible
to
have
a,
in
all
those
small
counties
all
over
the
united
states,
about
juries
“not
to
know”
something
about
the
past
life
of
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
you
disqualify
the
jurors
because
they
know
that
the
man
has
committed
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
not
kidding
(laughter).
i've
(inaudible)
to
the
fact
that
you
have
a
situation
here
which
you
know
as
the
law
accepts
and
jurors
are
supposed
to
know
that
that
life
of
the
man
is
on
trial.
here,
you
are
talking
about
a
policy
that's
wrong.
and
the
question
is,
are
you
going
to
the
right
tribunal
to
talk
about
that
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
came
from
a
small
county
in
alabama.
murders
that
have
been
committed
there
are
far
few
and
far
between.
everybody
knows
of
that.
all
the
jurors
know
that.
they
know
about
the
man
who
committed
it
and
worse
than
that.
what
would
you
do
in
a
county
like
that,
you
had
to
change
the
venue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
not
getting
away
from
the
word
“fact”
because
that's
an
abstract
word
which
is
not
in
the
constitution?
get
away
from
that
but
what
would
you
do
about
the
people
who
are
bound
to
know
that
this
man
committed
a
crime
before
and
have
been
in
the
penitentiary
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
they
will
find
out
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
know
he
has
committed
the
crime
and
he
has
suffered
the
penitentiary
sometime
before.
i've
known
many
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
don't
have
to
do
that
in
the
majority
of
counties
in
the
united
states
of
america
when
you
try
people
for
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
experience
as
a
lawyer
that
jurors
are
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
that
which
they
know
of
their
own
knowledge
in
the
past
and
by
that
which
was
offered
in
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
they
be
affected
if
they
just
do
it
from
the
outside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
gideon
vs.
wainwright,
we
were
concerned
with
the
fact
that
this
constitution
specifically
provides
that
a
man
should
have
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
then
use
the
word
“effective”
if
he
can't
request
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it's
wrong
for
the
jury
to
know
that
the
man
has
been
convicted
eight
times?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that's
constitutionally
wrong?
