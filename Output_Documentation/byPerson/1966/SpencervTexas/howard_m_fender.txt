mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
we
have
here
in
reed
vs.
beto
the
typical
old
time
habitual
case,
the
three
time
loser.
this
is
–
as
stated
aback
counsel
is
not
governed
by
requirement
of
the
same
offense
and
not
governed
by
the
requirement
that
they
be
capital
offenses
but
rather
that
they
all
be
offenses
less
in
capital.
this
is
society’s
attempt
and
effort
to
protect
itself
from
the
presence
of
man
who
have
proved
themselves
undesirable
and
unrehabilitable.
the
question
arises
now
is
as
to
why
we
have
tried
in
texas
everything
in
one
ball
of
action.
why
did
we
have
one
hearing
to
determine
both
guilt
and
innocence
in
the
recidivism
count?
and
i’ll
give
you
the
reason,
because
we
had
an
order
of
trial
fixed
by
statute
which
set
forth
exactly
what
must
to
be
done
in
each
case.
it
sets
forth,
“when
you
must
read
the
indictment
then
that
you
must
offer
your
proof,
that
next
the
court
must
instruct
the
jury
on
the
law,
that
next
the
jury
must
return
its
verdict
and
lastly,
that
the
court
shall
render
its
judgment”.
that
is
a
statute
passed
by
the
legislature
and
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
has
no
rule-making
power.
our
court
of
criminal
appeal
is
a
court
of
last
resort;
our
district
courts,
our
county
courts
and
our
justice
courts
all
have
appeal
going
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
none
of
inferior
courts
have
rule-making
power.
therefore,
in
order
to
comply
with
the
statute,
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
the
days
of
the
republic
of
texas,
it
was
no
choice
on
the
part
of
any
court
but
to
exhibit
to
the
jury
all
of
the
evidence
and
receive
one
verdict.
now,
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure
changes
this
not
only
with
regard
to
recidivism.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
recidivism
simply
rides
along
with
the
rest
of
our
procedure.
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure
sets
forth
a
two-staged
proceeding,
this,
once
again,
is
a
statutory
enactment
by
the
legislature
wherein
there
is
first
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
to
be
followed
by
one
of
two
alternative
procedures
in
cases
less
in
capital
to
determine
punishment.
now
this
is
a
fundamental
change
in
our
approach
but
it
is
not
direct
to
that
recidivism
but
rather
is
directed
in
our
entire
procedure
in
criminal
law
and
the
repetition
and
habitual
offenders
simply
ride
along
with
this
change
in
policy.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
i
meant
that
the
court
could
not
divide
the
proceedings
in
any
other
order
and
that
which
was
set
by
statute.
it
was,
therefore,
impossible
under
the
old
statute
for
the
court
to
hold
one
hearing,
receive
a
partial
verdict
from
the
jury
and
then
submit
more
evidence
and
more
instructions
to
the
jury
and
get
a
second
verdict
on
the
jury.
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
that
the
stipulation
is
acceptable
and
when
accepted,
that
the
prosecution
may
not
read
a
portion
of
the
indictment
alleging
the
prior
convictions
nor
present
evidence
to
the
jury.
in
the
sims
case
and
ross
case,
i
took
the
case
and
called
mr.
grady
height,
a
member
of
the
fort
worth
in
texas
bar
who
tried
that
case
and
argued
it
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
an
effort
to
tear
up
to
the
court
since
the
opinion
itself
was
somewhat
succinct
and
difficult
to
understand
and
he
indicated
that
their
entire
position
was
based
on
the
theory
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
no
rule-making
power
and
could
not
therefore
force
the
prosecutor
to
do
anything
other
than
follow
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute
unless
the
prosecutor
choose
to
go
along.
i’m
sorry
it
happened.
it
happened
on
my
own
hometown,
grady
height
worked
for
me
when
i
was
district
attorney
in
fort
worth
and
i
hated
i
have
to
talk
to
him
that
way
on
the
telephone
and
find
out
that
happened
that
he’d
taking
up
position
that
he
did.
our
court
rule
in
those
two
cases
essentially
that
they
were
paralyzed
for
lack
of
rule-making
power.
i
will
report
that
it
was
not
always
our
custom
to
that
entire
county
and
i
don’t
of
know
anything
with
precise
with
these
two
cases
where
that
was
done.
as
early
as
1952,
i
know
we
were
stipulating
prior
convictions
long
before
the
pitcock
decision
and
we
were
not
submitting
the
reading
to
the
jury
the
prior
indictments
nor
were
we
offering
proof
where
we
were
stipulating.
that
prior
to
1952,
i
don’t
know
because
i
was
not
district
attorney
prior
to
1952.
however,
it
was
a
procedure
that
we
pick
up
our
word
of
mouth
and
knows
we
proceeded
to
this.
so,
i
know
that
for
sometime
prior
to
that,
they
had
been
stipulating.
and
i
also
know
in
response
to
mr.
colven’s
testimony
about
what
prosecutors
do
and
i
was
happy
to
stipulate
the
prior
conviction
whether
you
don’t
prove
it
because
in
those
days
we
were
never
sure
we
could
prove
a
prior
conviction.
since
then,
fingerprint
methods
have
become
so
advanced
that
it
is
really
not
very
difficult
now
to
prove
a
prior
conviction
and
show
the
record
by
the
relationship
between
the
prison
fingerprints
and
the
current
fingerprints
taken
by
the
sheriff
of
the
man
who
is
on
trial.
but
it
used
to
be
a
very
difficult
thing
and
we
love
to
stipulate
on
them
so
we
wouldn’t
be
put
to
that
proof.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
not
while
i
was
district
attorney,
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
were
obviously
in
these
two
cases
that
went
up
from
tuck
county
where
mr.
grady
height
said
they
adopted
the
position
that
they
had
a
right
to
proceed
with
their
trial
and
that
being
dictated
to
by
the
defendants.
and
that
was
one
of
the
few
rights,
the
state
had
left
in
prosecuting
the
insistent
opponent.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
sims
and
ross
cases.
i
might
add
in
the
sims,
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
pressured
by
the
admitted
all
these
prior
convictions
in
relation
to
testifying;
that
in
ross,
the
defendant
testified
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
his
confession
was
voluntary.
and
in
the
absence
of
the
jury,
his
prior
convictions
were
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
in
full
court
and
then
they
were
later
on
introduced
before
the
jury
in
connection
with
his
trial.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
1964.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
1961,
excuse
me.
i
was
going
wrong
directions
from
this
pitcock
decision.
pitcock
was
in
1963
decision
but
i
say
the
practice
was
wide
spread
along
before
that.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
1952
to
1959
sir
–
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
we
followed
both.
if
are
they
for
the
stipulation,
we
stipulated.
if
they
did
not,
we
offer
the
proof.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
was
kind
a
nip
and
tuck,
your
honor.
if
they
didn’t
think
we
had
all
about
it,
they
wouldn’t
stipulate.
if
they
thought
we
had
the
necessary
proof,
they
would
usually
stipulate.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
would
say
we
had
to
make
more
proof
then
we
got
stipulations.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
contrary
is
through
the
day
because
its
--
the
proof
is
so
much
more
efficient
with
the
present
fingerprints
system.
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
here
before
yesterday
prevents
the
postponement
of
the
question
-
retrospective
or
retroactive
application.
there
was
no
objection
raised
on
the
trial
court
to
this
procedure.
there
was
no
motion
in
lemony
or
no
motion
to
elect
certain
counts.
it’s
true
that
this
indictment
contained
more
than
two
prior
convictions.
the
grand
jury’s
return
indictments
and
they
tell
they
find
from
the
evidence
before
them
the
things
that
go
in
the
indictments.
district
attorneys
prepare
them
under
the
direction
of
the
grand
jury.
in
this
instance,
the
grand
jury
found
that
all
these
prior
counts
existed.
this
was
a
pleading,
just
as
any
pleading
in
court
and
the
indictment
was
read
in
accordance
of
statute
requirement,
in
the
order
of
trial
that
the
indictment
be
read.
we
don’t
know
what
would
happen
if
the
defendant’s
attorney
-
and
admittedly
he
had
competent
counsel
–
we
do
not
know
what
would
happen
if
he
had
file
a
motion
to
require
the
state
to
elect
two
or
possibly
three
or
even
one
of
these
counts
for
enhancement
purposes.
we
don’t
know
what
would
happen
if
a
motion
in
lemony
had
been
filed
to
prohibit
the
reading
of
any
of
these
counts.
we
don’t
know
what
would
happen
if
an
objection
have
been
raised
nor
do
we
know
what
would
happen
if
an
offer
to
stipulate
had
been
made.
mr.
stanley
cork,
who
was
the
prosecutor
who
tried
that
case
when
this
was
introduced
and
admitted
to
this
court
yesterday
morning.
all
we
know
is
that
without
what’s
asking
the
trial
court
to
pass
on
this,
without
what’s
asking
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
pass
on
this
in
the
ordinary
course
of
appeal,
nor
without
asking
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
pass
on
this
by
way
of
habeas
corpus,
this
matter
was
first
submitted
to
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
17th
district
of
texas.
it
was
three
counts
submitted.
the
first
two
had
been
brought
up
in
normal
course
of
events
and
that
was
the
question
of
the
method
of
proof
of
the
priors
and
is
not
present
before
this
court.
but
that
was
the
reason
they
went
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals;
that
was
the
reason
they
initially
filed
on
the
federal
district
court;
and
they
headed
on,
for
the
first
time,
to
the
federal
district
court
of
–
i
might
had
to
put
the
habeas
corpus.
and
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
after
it
served
over
two
years
which
is
the
minimum
and
once
again,
did
not
raise
this
question
on
that
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeal.
then
for
the
first
time,
docket
on
the
federal
district
court
and
the
federal
district
court
did
not
consider
it
worthy
of
a
hearing,
a
plenary
hearing
but
this
means
count
three
with
the
simple
short
statement
that
appears
on
the
record
that
there
had
been
no
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
and
it
was
not
therefore
probably
before
district
court.
our
counsel
said
we
didn’t
raise
any
(inaudible).
i
believe
our
answer
to
the
application
for
certiorari
and
our
brief
on
the
merits,
once
again
caused
these
questions
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i
believe
this
is
jurisdiction
in
so
far
as
habeas
corpus
is
concerned
and
we
haven’t
given
up
for
minute.
i’m
feeling
that
this
is
improperly
before
the
court
because
they
did
not
exhaust
state
remedy
before
attempting
to
bring
this
in
the
federal
system.
nevertheless,
i
will
also
point
out
that
since
it
did
originate
as
a
collateral
attack,
this
court
in
determining
this
case
determines
whether
or
not
there
will
be
a
retroactive
application
of
any
rule
that
might
be
announced,
unless
the
court
simply
affirm
what
is
the
case
is,
which
naturally
we
hope
you
do
in
all
instances.
but
if
you
should
attempt
to
enunciate
any
other
rule
and
an
affirmation
if
your
apply
it
to
reed
you
are
automatically
applying
it
retroactive.
now
mr.
colven
mentions
the
537
habitual
offenders
who
were
in
the
penitentiary
on
the
first
day
of
january
or
the
31st
of
december.
even
the
penitentiary
system
does
have
no
accurate
account
is
because
in
some
of
these
small
counties
to
which
mr.
justice
black
earlier
referred,
the
bookkeeping
is
somewhat
sketchy.
and
if
a
man
is
convicted
out
of
an
offense
where
it
is
possible
to
receive
life
imprisonment,
they
may
not
include
the
fact
that
it
was
enhanced
when
they
send
the
papers
down
to
the
penitentiary
but
may
merely
show
the
offense
in
life
imprisonment
and
give
the
sheriff
his
commitment
papers
and
the
sheriff
gets
in
his
car
and
takes
him
down
of
the
penitentiary.
these
537
are
once
that
came
from
counties
that
did
show
enhancement.
if,
for
instance,
burglary
is
the
punishable
charge
as
it
is
in
the
reed
case,
12
years
is
the
maximum
punishment
that
can
be
given
for
the
offense
without
enhancement
under
article
63.
so
it
would
be
necessary
there
for
the
records
to,
in
some
way,
reflect
why
they
had
a
man
charged
with
burglary
that
was
in
the
penitentiary
for
life?
and
also,
in
your
major
counties
where
they
have
somewhat
larger
stuffs,
more
people
to
keep
track,
they
would
have
their
records
more
in
order
and
it
would
reflect
that.
there
is
another
set
of
much
larger
that’s
in
nowhere
reflected
on
the
records
and
that
is
the
repetition
offenses
which
would
be
those
charges
under
article
62
because
in
that
event,
the
punishment
never
exceeds
the
maximum
possible
punishment
for
the
offense
and
it’s
only
in
a
few
instances
in
the
major
countries
where
they
show
the
repetition
count
on
their
paper
work
and
then
they
just
--
penitentiary
opens
the
door
and
then
comes
a
sheriff
from
one
of
the
counties
and
the
man
who’s
got
the
maximum
punishment.
it
could
have
a
reason
from
enhancement
or
it
could
have
a
reason
simply
because
the
jury
chose
to
give
him
the
maximum.
at
any
rate,
it
would
be
far
in
excess
of
537
people
in
texas
alone
who
would
be
affected
by
any
retroactive
application
of
any
prosper
that
might
be
enunciated.
now,
counsel
spoke
of
the
concepts
of
ordered
liberty
in
connection
with
his
client.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
concepts
of
ordered
liberty
with
regards
to
society.
ordered
society
frond
upon
repetition
of
crime.
we
started
with
little
children
and
we
tried
to
teach
them
not
to
do
again
that
which
we
forbid
them
to
do
the
first
time.
we
first
give
them
a
spank
on
the
wrist
and
if
that
doesn’t
work,
we
give
them
a
spank
on
the
rear
arm.
and
if
that
doesn’t
work
the
third
time,
we
take
a
switch
and
work
him
over
pretty
good.
that
has
been
the
history
of
the
instilling
of
discipline
of
any
orderly
society
starting
with
the
family
and
going
on
up
to
our
national
scene.
the
effectiveness
of
enhancement
extends
itself
to
other
statutes
besides
these
three
penal
code
statutes.
article
186
of
the
penal
code
provides
that

than
$5
to
more
than
$50;
in
the
second
conviction,
not
less
than
50
or
more
than
100;
by
third
conviction
to
the
same
offense,
he’d
by
fine
not
less
than
$100,
no
more
than
$300
and
be
subject
to
removal
from

i
submit
that
the
principle,
if
applicable
to
the
case,
is
analogous
of
the
applicability
to
these
other
enhancement
statutes.
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it’s
true,
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
see
how
this
court
can
strike
down
the
procedure
about
which
they
complain
and
leave
us
with
a
procedure
where,
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
it
will
be
necessary
to
do
just
what
you
would
say
as
prejudicial
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
a
driving
while
intoxicated
statute
says
the
first
offense
should
be
a
misdemeanor,
it
says
the
second
offense
shall
be
a
felony.
well,
we
can’t
go
into
the
district
court
on
a
misdemeanor
as
we
first
go
in
as
a
felony
and
later
if
we
fail
on
the
repetition
count,
they
could
find
him
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
but
in
order
to
stay
in
the
district
court,
we
have
to
prove
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
that
that
man
has
been
there
before
convicted
of
the
misdemeanor
offense
of
driving
while
intoxicated.
now
if
you
(blowing
nose)
constitutional
matter
to
say
that
what
we
have
done
in
our
recidivist
case
is
wrong,
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
have
to
strike
that,
i
have
right
to
prove
that
prior
to
dwi
in
order
to
stay
in
court
with
the
felony.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
now
i
make
any
concessions
of
record,
your
honor.
the
state’s
in
bad
now
shape
now
without
conceding
anything.
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i’m
sure
that
our
legislature
will
have
to
adjust
anything
that
is
set
forth
as
law,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
as
it
stands
right
now
and
until
our
legislature
goes
back
in
session,
we
are
faced
with
jurisdictional
proof
or
prior
offense
in
several
field
and
there
is
no
procedure
to
have
a
pretrial
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
one
and
the
same
and
i
don’t
have
the
jury
passed
on
the
facts.
and
under
our
system,
any
fact
issue
is
submittable
to
a
jury.
we
do
not
have
any
system
at
this
time
in
texas
to
permit
the
court
to
pass
upon
the
jurisdictional
facts
or
the
court
to
pass
after
the
jury
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
recidivist
fact
unless
the
defendant
waives
his
right
and
appears
voluntarily
before
the
court
for
that
purpose.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it
provides
for
that
and
everything
except
capital
cases.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it
only
does
that,
mr.
justice
fortas,
insofar
as
recidivism
is
concerned.
i
don’t
have
in
any
other
way
change
the
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
under
which
we
can
present
evidence
of
prior
convictions.
we
still
have
the
right
--
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand,
we
still
have
the
right
to
impeach
him
by
the
proof
of
prior
convictions
if
for
any
other
reasons
show
method,
intent,
design
we
can
prove
prior
convictions.
all
of
these
reasons
are
still
justice
available
under
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure
as
they
were
under
the
old.
the
only
change
that
has
been
made
is
the
two-staged
proceeding
in
recidivism,
and
as
i
have
said
earlier,
is
not
reason
for
the
change;
it
just
goes
along
with
the
change.
many
people
criticize
the
system
under
which
a
jury
would
hear
the
evidence
on
which
conviction
would
be
based
and
would
out
of
that
evidence
determine
punishment.
it
produced
some
occasional
and
equitable
results.
many
thought
that
the
new
system
would
be
more
orderly
and
that
you
would
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
then
you
would
have
a
hearing
and
all
for
evidence
pro
and
con
and
determine
the
punishment.
i
might
answer
it,
it
was
frankly
compromise
between
those
who
wanted
the
jury
to
continue
doing
it
all
and
the
people
on
the
other
side
who
wanted
the
court
to
be
given
the
full,
overt
and
of
assessing
punishment
once
the
jury
had
determine
guilt
or
innocence
such
as
is
done
in
federal
assessment.
we
end
up
of
the
compromise
unless
the
defendant
chose
the
one
that
he
thinks
would
get
him
at
least
time.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
that’s
why
we
have
the
two-staged
proceeding
now.
counsel
spoke
of
swap
outs
and
with
regard
to
the
dropping
of
the
habitual
counts
in
return
for
plea
of
guilty
and
i
say
it’s
all
in
your
view
point.
he
says
he
was
pressured
by
the
prosecutor
and
i
say,
you
can,
just
as
easily
say
that
was
merciful
waiver
on
the
part
of
the
state’s
attorney
and
an
effort
to
get
the
man
into
the
penitentiary
and
rehabilitate
it
and
back
out
again.
and
me
as
far
as
rehabilitation
is
concerned,
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
well,
when
i
was
--
during
the
time
i
was
prosecuting,
we
average
about
30
indictments
a
week
in
terrell
county,
during
that
times
the
grand
jury
was
in
session
which
was
all
but
two
weeks
out
of
the
year,
we
had
two
then
i
have
three
criminal
districts
court
then
i
had
three
county
criminal
courts
and
we
could
not
possibly
have
discharge
our
dockets
without
obtaining
a
fairly
substantial
volume
of
guilty
plea.
we
tried
to
avoid
putting
ourselves
in
the
position
of
selling
out.
we
tried
to
have
a
realistic
appraisals
of
the
cases
but
we
did
on
a
number
of
occasions
agree
to
accept
guilty
pleas
where
we
would
dismiss
--
in
habitual
cases
sometimes,
we
would
cut
back
to
one
enhancement
and
agreed
on
a
guilty
plea
for
maximum
such
as
12
years
in
burglar
cases
and
so
forth.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
in
a
major
population
center
in
texas
under
our
present
set
up
with
the
stuff
and
the
equipment
available.
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
move
a
docket
without
a
substantial
number
of
guilty
pleas.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
it’s
quite
common
for
the
defendants
to
send
from
the
jail
to
ask
that
someone
come
up
and
talk
to
me
if
they
didn’t
have
an
attorney.
if
i
did
have
an
attorney,
they
would
have
an
attorney
come
talk
to
us.
but
most
of
you
get
to
prisoner
work
that
and
the
court
remark
that
it
has
been
set
for
trial
and
you
go
in
there
and
you
may
have
a
docket
of
eight
cases
for
the
morning
and
six
of
them
may
plea
guilty
and
two
of
them
get
continuances
and
you’re
through
about
11
o'clock
in
the
morning.
until
they
get
in
there
and
so-to-speak-up
glee
club,
they
don’t
really
want
to
give
up.
but
once
they
get
in
into
the
courtroom,
their
ready
to
work
something
out
of
sensible.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
a
probated
or
suspended
sentence
doesn’t
count.
furthermore,
in
order
to
enhance
for
life,
you
got
to
make
sure
that
the
first
offense
was
committed,
the
man
was
convicted
and
served
time
and
then
he
committed
the
second
offense
and
was
tried
to
convict
on
the
third
time
on
that
and
then
committed
the
third
offense.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
you
can’t
freshly
charge
a
man
with
three
hot
checks
written
on
the
same
day
and
try
him
and
then
use
two
of
those
charges
later
to
enhance
a
case
into
habituality.
well,
it
has
to
be
a
3-staged
proceeding
in
that
order.
counsels
spoke
with
a
white
shirt
of
innocence
in
the
cloak
of
prejudice
and
i
must
say
it
that
this
people
that
come
in
in
court
charge
with
the
prior
offenses
may
have
a
white
shirt
of
innocence
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
as
far
as
society
is
concerned,
it’s
soiled,
and
badly
soiled.
and
we
have
a
system
which
is
fair
in
its
application
to
everyone,
is
applied
in
the
same
manner
to
all
who
get
before
the
bar
of
justice.
for
in
our
state
has
seen,
and
i
hope
the
tenth
amendment
still
lets
us
see
it,
we
will
deal
this
way
with
our
unrehabilitable
criminals.
we
will
not
sent
our
boys
to
farm
soil
the
faith
and
die
even
as
they
die,
we
give
in
the
other
great
reminisce
from
within.
we
will
get
these
undesirables
out
of
circulation.
we
will
send
them
to
the
penitentiary
and
if
they
show
themselves
acceptable
to
society
again,
they
may
be
part
of
our
parole.
but
until
then,
the
state
should
have
the
right
to
remove
and
keep
removed
its
undesirable
citizens
and
that
would
certainly
take
the
thing
that
after
we
have
followed
the
procedure
for
over
a
hundred
years
that
we
would
certainly
find
537
of
the
most
undesirable
citizens
in
the
entire
state
turn
lose
because
one
man
says,
“i
was
faced
with
a
prejudiced
jury”.
and
yet,
when
the
jury
went
into
that
box,
the
defendant’s
attorney
had
qualified
everyone
on
those
jurors
on
whether
or
not
they
could
disregard
the
prior
convictions
in
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
and
those
who
said
they
could
not
were
excused
from
the
jury.
that
man
had
ample
opportunity
to
qualify
the
jury
and
had
they
not
been
able
to
get
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
he
could
have
moved
for
a
change
of
venue.
he
accepted
these
things
without
qualification
and
without
objection.
and
now,
he
comes
to
this
court
way
in
the
end,
and
says
despite
what
district
court
said,
despite
what
happened
prior
to
that
time,
i
want
you
to
reach
back
in
the
past
and
turn
me
lose
and
when
you
knew,
you
are
going
to
pull
the
flag
out
of
a
wrong
and
arrest
to
those
fellows
who
lose
and
they
are
all
in
there
having
understood,
after
they
committed
the
first
offense
and
what
did
the
penitentiary.
they
knew
what
“repetition”
meant
and
later
they
knew
what
“habituality”
meant.
everyone
on
the
penitentiary
knows
those
things
and
when
they
gladly
commit
that
next
offense,
they
do
it
knowing
that
they
can
be
put
away
for
life
which
shows
to
me
and
to
the
world
they
are
unfit
for
society.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
we
have
here
in
reed
vs.
beto
the
typical
old
time
habitual
case,
the
three
time
loser.
this
is
–
as
stated
aback
counsel
is
not
governed
by
requirement
of
the
same
offense
and
not
governed
by
the
requirement
that
they
be
capital
offenses
but
rather
that
they
all
be
offenses
less
in
capital.
this
is
society’s
attempt
and
effort
to
protect
itself
from
the
presence
of
man
who
have
proved
themselves
undesirable
and
unrehabilitable.
the
question
arises
now
is
as
to
why
we
have
tried
in
texas
everything
in
one
ball
of
action.
why
did
we
have
one
hearing
to
determine
both
guilt
and
innocence
in
the
recidivism
count?
and
i’ll
give
you
the
reason,
because
we
had
an
order
of
trial
fixed
by
statute
which
set
forth
exactly
what
must
to
be
done
in
each
case.
it
sets
forth,
“when
you
must
read
the
indictment
then
that
you
must
offer
your
proof,
that
next
the
court
must
instruct
the
jury
on
the
law,
that
next
the
jury
must
return
its
verdict
and
lastly,
that
the
court
shall
render
its
judgment”.
that
is
a
statute
passed
by
the
legislature
and
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
has
no
rule-making
power.
our
court
of
criminal
appeal
is
a
court
of
last
resort;
our
district
courts,
our
county
courts
and
our
justice
courts
all
have
appeal
going
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
none
of
inferior
courts
have
rule-making
power.
therefore,
in
order
to
comply
with
the
statute,
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
the
days
of
the
republic
of
texas,
it
was
no
choice
on
the
part
of
any
court
but
to
exhibit
to
the
jury
all
of
the
evidence
and
receive
one
verdict.
now,
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure
changes
this
not
only
with
regard
to
recidivism.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
recidivism
simply
rides
along
with
the
rest
of
our
procedure.
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure
sets
forth
a
two-staged
proceeding,
this,
once
again,
is
a
statutory
enactment
by
the
legislature
wherein
there
is
first
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
to
be
followed
by
one
of
two
alternative
procedures
in
cases
less
in
capital
to
determine
punishment.
now
this
is
a
fundamental
change
in
our
approach
but
it
is
not
direct
to
that
recidivism
but
rather
is
directed
in
our
entire
procedure
in
criminal
law
and
the
repetition
and
habitual
offenders
simply
ride
along
with
this
change
in
policy.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
i
meant
that
the
court
could
not
divide
the
proceedings
in
any
other
order
and
that
which
was
set
by
statute.
it
was,
therefore,
impossible
under
the
old
statute
for
the
court
to
hold
one
hearing,
receive
a
partial
verdict
from
the
jury
and
then
submit
more
evidence
and
more
instructions
to
the
jury
and
get
a
second
verdict
on
the
jury.
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
that
the
stipulation
is
acceptable
and
when
accepted,
that
the
prosecution
may
not
read
a
portion
of
the
indictment
alleging
the
prior
convictions
nor
present
evidence
to
the
jury.
in
the
sims
case
and
ross
case,
i
took
the
case
and
called
mr.
grady
height,
a
member
of
the
fort
worth
in
texas
bar
who
tried
that
case
and
argued
it
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
an
effort
to
tear
up
to
the
court
since
the
opinion
itself
was
somewhat
succinct
and
difficult
to
understand
and
he
indicated
that
their
entire
position
was
based
on
the
theory
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
no
rule-making
power
and
could
not
therefore
force
the
prosecutor
to
do
anything
other
than
follow
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute
unless
the
prosecutor
choose
to
go
along.
i’m
sorry
it
happened.
it
happened
on
my
own
hometown,
grady
height
worked
for
me
when
i
was
district
attorney
in
fort
worth
and
i
hated
i
have
to
talk
to
him
that
way
on
the
telephone
and
find
out
that
happened
that
he’d
taking
up
position
that
he
did.
our
court
rule
in
those
two
cases
essentially
that
they
were
paralyzed
for
lack
of
rule-making
power.
i
will
report
that
it
was
not
always
our
custom
to
that
entire
county
and
i
don’t
of
know
anything
with
precise
with
these
two
cases
where
that
was
done.
as
early
as
1952,
i
know
we
were
stipulating
prior
convictions
long
before
the
pitcock
decision
and
we
were
not
submitting
the
reading
to
the
jury
the
prior
indictments
nor
were
we
offering
proof
where
we
were
stipulating.
that
prior
to
1952,
i
don’t
know
because
i
was
not
district
attorney
prior
to
1952.
however,
it
was
a
procedure
that
we
pick
up
our
word
of
mouth
and
knows
we
proceeded
to
this.
so,
i
know
that
for
sometime
prior
to
that,
they
had
been
stipulating.
and
i
also
know
in
response
to
mr.
colven’s
testimony
about
what
prosecutors
do
and
i
was
happy
to
stipulate
the
prior
conviction
whether
you
don’t
prove
it
because
in
those
days
we
were
never
sure
we
could
prove
a
prior
conviction.
since
then,
fingerprint
methods
have
become
so
advanced
that
it
is
really
not
very
difficult
now
to
prove
a
prior
conviction
and
show
the
record
by
the
relationship
between
the
prison
fingerprints
and
the
current
fingerprints
taken
by
the
sheriff
of
the
man
who
is
on
trial.
but
it
used
to
be
a
very
difficult
thing
and
we
love
to
stipulate
on
them
so
we
wouldn’t
be
put
to
that
proof.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
not
while
i
was
district
attorney,
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
were
obviously
in
these
two
cases
that
went
up
from
tuck
county
where
mr.
grady
height
said
they
adopted
the
position
that
they
had
a
right
to
proceed
with
their
trial
and
that
being
dictated
to
by
the
defendants.
and
that
was
one
of
the
few
rights,
the
state
had
left
in
prosecuting
the
insistent
opponent.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
sims
and
ross
cases.
i
might
add
in
the
sims,
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
pressured
by
the
admitted
all
these
prior
convictions
in
relation
to
testifying;
that
in
ross,
the
defendant
testified
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
his
confession
was
voluntary.
and
in
the
absence
of
the
jury,
his
prior
convictions
were
used
to
impeach
his
testimony
in
full
court
and
then
they
were
later
on
introduced
before
the
jury
in
connection
with
his
trial.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
1964.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
1961,
excuse
me.
i
was
going
wrong
directions
from
this
pitcock
decision.
pitcock
was
in
1963
decision
but
i
say
the
practice
was
wide
spread
along
before
that.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
1952
to
1959
sir
–
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
we
followed
both.
if
are
they
for
the
stipulation,
we
stipulated.
if
they
did
not,
we
offer
the
proof.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
was
kind
a
nip
and
tuck,
your
honor.
if
they
didn’t
think
we
had
all
about
it,
they
wouldn’t
stipulate.
if
they
thought
we
had
the
necessary
proof,
they
would
usually
stipulate.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
would
say
we
had
to
make
more
proof
then
we
got
stipulations.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
contrary
is
through
the
day
because
its
--
the
proof
is
so
much
more
efficient
with
the
present
fingerprints
system.
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
here
before
yesterday
prevents
the
postponement
of
the
question
-
retrospective
or
retroactive
application.
there
was
no
objection
raised
on
the
trial
court
to
this
procedure.
there
was
no
motion
in
lemony
or
no
motion
to
elect
certain
counts.
it’s
true
that
this
indictment
contained
more
than
two
prior
convictions.
the
grand
jury’s
return
indictments
and
they
tell
they
find
from
the
evidence
before
them
the
things
that
go
in
the
indictments.
district
attorneys
prepare
them
under
the
direction
of
the
grand
jury.
in
this
instance,
the
grand
jury
found
that
all
these
prior
counts
existed.
this
was
a
pleading,
just
as
any
pleading
in
court
and
the
indictment
was
read
in
accordance
of
statute
requirement,
in
the
order
of
trial
that
the
indictment
be
read.
we
don’t
know
what
would
happen
if
the
defendant’s
attorney
-
and
admittedly
he
had
competent
counsel
–
we
do
not
know
what
would
happen
if
he
had
file
a
motion
to
require
the
state
to
elect
two
or
possibly
three
or
even
one
of
these
counts
for
enhancement
purposes.
we
don’t
know
what
would
happen
if
a
motion
in
lemony
had
been
filed
to
prohibit
the
reading
of
any
of
these
counts.
we
don’t
know
what
would
happen
if
an
objection
have
been
raised
nor
do
we
know
what
would
happen
if
an
offer
to
stipulate
had
been
made.
mr.
stanley
cork,
who
was
the
prosecutor
who
tried
that
case
when
this
was
introduced
and
admitted
to
this
court
yesterday
morning.
all
we
know
is
that
without
what’s
asking
the
trial
court
to
pass
on
this,
without
what’s
asking
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
pass
on
this
in
the
ordinary
course
of
appeal,
nor
without
asking
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
pass
on
this
by
way
of
habeas
corpus,
this
matter
was
first
submitted
to
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
17th
district
of
texas.
it
was
three
counts
submitted.
the
first
two
had
been
brought
up
in
normal
course
of
events
and
that
was
the
question
of
the
method
of
proof
of
the
priors
and
is
not
present
before
this
court.
but
that
was
the
reason
they
went
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals;
that
was
the
reason
they
initially
filed
on
the
federal
district
court;
and
they
headed
on,
for
the
first
time,
to
the
federal
district
court
of
–
i
might
had
to
put
the
habeas
corpus.
and
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
after
it
served
over
two
years
which
is
the
minimum
and
once
again,
did
not
raise
this
question
on
that
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeal.
then
for
the
first
time,
docket
on
the
federal
district
court
and
the
federal
district
court
did
not
consider
it
worthy
of
a
hearing,
a
plenary
hearing
but
this
means
count
three
with
the
simple
short
statement
that
appears
on
the
record
that
there
had
been
no
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
and
it
was
not
therefore
probably
before
district
court.
our
counsel
said
we
didn’t
raise
any
(inaudible).
i
believe
our
answer
to
the
application
for
certiorari
and
our
brief
on
the
merits,
once
again
caused
these
questions
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i
believe
this
is
jurisdiction
in
so
far
as
habeas
corpus
is
concerned
and
we
haven’t
given
up
for
minute.
i’m
feeling
that
this
is
improperly
before
the
court
because
they
did
not
exhaust
state
remedy
before
attempting
to
bring
this
in
the
federal
system.
nevertheless,
i
will
also
point
out
that
since
it
did
originate
as
a
collateral
attack,
this
court
in
determining
this
case
determines
whether
or
not
there
will
be
a
retroactive
application
of
any
rule
that
might
be
announced,
unless
the
court
simply
affirm
what
is
the
case
is,
which
naturally
we
hope
you
do
in
all
instances.
but
if
you
should
attempt
to
enunciate
any
other
rule
and
an
affirmation
if
your
apply
it
to
reed
you
are
automatically
applying
it
retroactive.
now
mr.
colven
mentions
the
537
habitual
offenders
who
were
in
the
penitentiary
on
the
first
day
of
january
or
the
31st
of
december.
even
the
penitentiary
system
does
have
no
accurate
account
is
because
in
some
of
these
small
counties
to
which
mr.
justice
black
earlier
referred,
the
bookkeeping
is
somewhat
sketchy.
and
if
a
man
is
convicted
out
of
an
offense
where
it
is
possible
to
receive
life
imprisonment,
they
may
not
include
the
fact
that
it
was
enhanced
when
they
send
the
papers
down
to
the
penitentiary
but
may
merely
show
the
offense
in
life
imprisonment
and
give
the
sheriff
his
commitment
papers
and
the
sheriff
gets
in
his
car
and
takes
him
down
of
the
penitentiary.
these
537
are
once
that
came
from
counties
that
did
show
enhancement.
if,
for
instance,
burglary
is
the
punishable
charge
as
it
is
in
the
reed
case,
12
years
is
the
maximum
punishment
that
can
be
given
for
the
offense
without
enhancement
under
article
63.
so
it
would
be
necessary
there
for
the
records
to,
in
some
way,
reflect
why
they
had
a
man
charged
with
burglary
that
was
in
the
penitentiary
for
life?
and
also,
in
your
major
counties
where
they
have
somewhat
larger
stuffs,
more
people
to
keep
track,
they
would
have
their
records
more
in
order
and
it
would
reflect
that.
there
is
another
set
of
much
larger
that’s
in
nowhere
reflected
on
the
records
and
that
is
the
repetition
offenses
which
would
be
those
charges
under
article
62
because
in
that
event,
the
punishment
never
exceeds
the
maximum
possible
punishment
for
the
offense
and
it’s
only
in
a
few
instances
in
the
major
countries
where
they
show
the
repetition
count
on
their
paper
work
and
then
they
just
--
penitentiary
opens
the
door
and
then
comes
a
sheriff
from
one
of
the
counties
and
the
man
who’s
got
the
maximum
punishment.
it
could
have
a
reason
from
enhancement
or
it
could
have
a
reason
simply
because
the
jury
chose
to
give
him
the
maximum.
at
any
rate,
it
would
be
far
in
excess
of
537
people
in
texas
alone
who
would
be
affected
by
any
retroactive
application
of
any
prosper
that
might
be
enunciated.
now,
counsel
spoke
of
the
concepts
of
ordered
liberty
in
connection
with
his
client.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
concepts
of
ordered
liberty
with
regards
to
society.
ordered
society
frond
upon
repetition
of
crime.
we
started
with
little
children
and
we
tried
to
teach
them
not
to
do
again
that
which
we
forbid
them
to
do
the
first
time.
we
first
give
them
a
spank
on
the
wrist
and
if
that
doesn’t
work,
we
give
them
a
spank
on
the
rear
arm.
and
if
that
doesn’t
work
the
third
time,
we
take
a
switch
and
work
him
over
pretty
good.
that
has
been
the
history
of
the
instilling
of
discipline
of
any
orderly
society
starting
with
the
family
and
going
on
up
to
our
national
scene.
the
effectiveness
of
enhancement
extends
itself
to
other
statutes
besides
these
three
penal
code
statutes.
article
186
of
the
penal
code
provides
that
any
county
or
municipal
officer
guilty
of
drunkenness
shall
be
fined
not
less
than
$5
to
more
than
$50;
in
the
second
conviction,
not
less
than
50
or
more
than
100;
by
third
conviction
to
the
same
offense,
he’d
by
fine
not
less
than
$100,
no
more
than
$300
and
be
subject
to
removal
from
office.
article
527
relating
to
obscene
photographs
and
literature
or
exhibiting
any
obscene
book
refers
to
offense
of
$2,000
fine
or
a
year
in
jail
or
a
both;
second
offense,
penitentiary
for
five
years
or
a
fine
of
$10,000
or
both.
possession
of
burglary
tools
with
intent
to
commit
burglary
for
a
person
convicted
of
a
felony
under
the
laws
of
the
us
and
the
state
of
texas,
the
fine
of
not
less
than
$500
or
more
than
$5,000
or
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
not
to
exceed
two
years.
in
article
1555b
concerning
the
presentation
of
a
credit
card
with
intent
to
defraud
on
the
first
offense
is
misdemeanor,
punishment
to
the
county
jail
not
exceeding
two
years
or
a
fine
(coughing)
not
exceeding
$1,000;
on
the
second
conviction,
not
less
than
30
days
or
more
than
two
years
and
a
fine
not
exceeding
$2,000;
third
and
subsequent
convictions
not
less
than
two
and
not
more
than
ten
years
in
the
penitentiary.
i
submit
that
the
principle,
if
applicable
to
the
case,
is
analogous
of
the
applicability
to
these
other
enhancement
statutes.
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it’s
true,
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
see
how
this
court
can
strike
down
the
procedure
about
which
they
complain
and
leave
us
with
a
procedure
where,
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
it
will
be
necessary
to
do
just
what
you
would
say
as
prejudicial
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
a
driving
while
intoxicated
statute
says
the
first
offense
should
be
a
misdemeanor,
it
says
the
second
offense
shall
be
a
felony.
well,
we
can’t
go
into
the
district
court
on
a
misdemeanor
as
we
first
go
in
as
a
felony
and
later
if
we
fail
on
the
repetition
count,
they
could
find
him
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
but
in
order
to
stay
in
the
district
court,
we
have
to
prove
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
that
that
man
has
been
there
before
convicted
of
the
misdemeanor
offense
of
driving
while
intoxicated.
now
if
you
(blowing
nose)
constitutional
matter
to
say
that
what
we
have
done
in
our
recidivist
case
is
wrong,
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
have
to
strike
that,
i
have
right
to
prove
that
prior
to
dwi
in
order
to
stay
in
court
with
the
felony.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
now
i
make
any
concessions
of
record,
your
honor.
the
state’s
in
bad
now
shape
now
without
conceding
anything.
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i’m
sure
that
our
legislature
will
have
to
adjust
anything
that
is
set
forth
as
law,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
as
it
stands
right
now
and
until
our
legislature
goes
back
in
session,
we
are
faced
with
jurisdictional
proof
or
prior
offense
in
several
field
and
there
is
no
procedure
to
have
a
pretrial
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
one
and
the
same
and
i
don’t
have
the
jury
passed
on
the
facts.
and
under
our
system,
any
fact
issue
is
submittable
to
a
jury.
we
do
not
have
any
system
at
this
time
in
texas
to
permit
the
court
to
pass
upon
the
jurisdictional
facts
or
the
court
to
pass
after
the
jury
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
recidivist
fact
unless
the
defendant
waives
his
right
and
appears
voluntarily
before
the
court
for
that
purpose.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it
provides
for
that
and
everything
except
capital
cases.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it
only
does
that,
mr.
justice
fortas,
insofar
as
recidivism
is
concerned.
i
don’t
have
in
any
other
way
change
the
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
under
which
we
can
present
evidence
of
prior
convictions.
we
still
have
the
right
--
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand,
we
still
have
the
right
to
impeach
him
by
the
proof
of
prior
convictions
if
for
any
other
reasons
show
method,
intent,
design
we
can
prove
prior
convictions.
all
of
these
reasons
are
still
justice
available
under
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure
as
they
were
under
the
old.
the
only
change
that
has
been
made
is
the
two-staged
proceeding
in
recidivism,
and
as
i
have
said
earlier,
is
not
reason
for
the
change;
it
just
goes
along
with
the
change.
many
people
criticize
the
system
under
which
a
jury
would
hear
the
evidence
on
which
conviction
would
be
based
and
would
out
of
that
evidence
determine
punishment.
it
produced
some
occasional
and
equitable
results.
many
thought
that
the
new
system
would
be
more
orderly
and
that
you
would
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
then
you
would
have
a
hearing
and
all
for
evidence
pro
and
con
and
determine
the
punishment.
i
might
answer
it,
it
was
frankly
compromise
between
those
who
wanted
the
jury
to
continue
doing
it
all
and
the
people
on
the
other
side
who
wanted
the
court
to
be
given
the
full,
overt
and
of
assessing
punishment
once
the
jury
had
determine
guilt
or
innocence
such
as
is
done
in
federal
assessment.
we
end
up
of
the
compromise
unless
the
defendant
chose
the
one
that
he
thinks
would
get
him
at
least
time.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
that’s
why
we
have
the
two-staged
proceeding
now.
counsel
spoke
of
swap
outs
and
with
regard
to
the
dropping
of
the
habitual
counts
in
return
for
plea
of
guilty
and
i
say
it’s
all
in
your
view
point.
he
says
he
was
pressured
by
the
prosecutor
and
i
say,
you
can,
just
as
easily
say
that
was
merciful
waiver
on
the
part
of
the
state’s
attorney
and
an
effort
to
get
the
man
into
the
penitentiary
and
rehabilitate
it
and
back
out
again.
and
me
as
far
as
rehabilitation
is
concerned,
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
well,
when
i
was
--
during
the
time
i
was
prosecuting,
we
average
about
30
indictments
a
week
in
terrell
county,
during
that
times
the
grand
jury
was
in
session
which
was
all
but
two
weeks
out
of
the
year,
we
had
two
then
i
have
three
criminal
districts
court
then
i
had
three
county
criminal
courts
and
we
could
not
possibly
have
discharge
our
dockets
without
obtaining
a
fairly
substantial
volume
of
guilty
plea.
we
tried
to
avoid
putting
ourselves
in
the
position
of
selling
out.
we
tried
to
have
a
realistic
appraisals
of
the
cases
but
we
did
on
a
number
of
occasions
agree
to
accept
guilty
pleas
where
we
would
dismiss
--
in
habitual
cases
sometimes,
we
would
cut
back
to
one
enhancement
and
agreed
on
a
guilty
plea
for
maximum
such
as
12
years
in
burglar
cases
and
so
forth.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
in
a
major
population
center
in
texas
under
our
present
set
up
with
the
stuff
and
the
equipment
available.
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
move
a
docket
without
a
substantial
number
of
guilty
pleas.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
it’s
quite
common
for
the
defendants
to
send
from
the
jail
to
ask
that
someone
come
up
and
talk
to
me
if
they
didn’t
have
an
attorney.
if
i
did
have
an
attorney,
they
would
have
an
attorney
come
talk
to
us.
but
most
of
you
get
to
prisoner
work
that
and
the
court
remark
that
it
has
been
set
for
trial
and
you
go
in
there
and
you
may
have
a
docket
of
eight
cases
for
the
morning
and
six
of
them
may
plea
guilty
and
two
of
them
get
continuances
and
you’re
through
about
11
o'clock
in
the
morning.
until
they
get
in
there
and
so-to-speak-up
glee
club,
they
don’t
really
want
to
give
up.
but
once
they
get
in
into
the
courtroom,
their
ready
to
work
something
out
of
sensible.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no,
sir.
a
probated
or
suspended
sentence
doesn’t
count.
furthermore,
in
order
to
enhance
for
life,
you
got
to
make
sure
that
the
first
offense
was
committed,
the
man
was
convicted
and
served
time
and
then
he
committed
the
second
offense
and
was
tried
to
convict
on
the
third
time
on
that
and
then
committed
the
third
offense.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
you
can’t
freshly
charge
a
man
with
three
hot
checks
written
on
the
same
day
and
try
him
and
then
use
two
of
those
charges
later
to
enhance
a
case
into
habituality.
well,
it
has
to
be
a
3-staged
proceeding
in
that
order.
counsels
spoke
with
a
white
shirt
of
innocence
in
the
cloak
of
prejudice
and
i
must
say
it
that
this
people
that
come
in
in
court
charge
with
the
prior
offenses
may
have
a
white
shirt
of
innocence
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
as
far
as
society
is
concerned,
it’s
soiled,
and
badly
soiled.
and
we
have
a
system
which
is
fair
in
its
application
to
everyone,
is
applied
in
the
same
manner
to
all
who
get
before
the
bar
of
justice.
for
in
our
state
has
seen,
and
i
hope
the
tenth
amendment
still
lets
us
see
it,
we
will
deal
this
way
with
our
unrehabilitable
criminals.
we
will
not
sent
our
boys
to
farm
soil
the
faith
and
die
even
as
they
die,
we
give
in
the
other
great
reminisce
from
within.
we
will
get
these
undesirables
out
of
circulation.
we
will
send
them
to
the
penitentiary
and
if
they
show
themselves
acceptable
to
society
again,
they
may
be
part
of
our
parole.
but
until
then,
the
state
should
have
the
right
to
remove
and
keep
removed
its
undesirable
citizens
and
that
would
certainly
take
the
thing
that
after
we
have
followed
the
procedure
for
over
a
hundred
years
that
we
would
certainly
find
537
of
the
most
undesirable
citizens
in
the
entire
state
turn
lose
because
one
man
says,
“i
was
faced
with
a
prejudiced
jury”.
and
yet,
when
the
jury
went
into
that
box,
the
defendant’s
attorney
had
qualified
everyone
on
those
jurors
on
whether
or
not
they
could
disregard
the
prior
convictions
in
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
and
those
who
said
they
could
not
were
excused
from
the
jury.
that
man
had
ample
opportunity
to
qualify
the
jury
and
had
they
not
been
able
to
get
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
he
could
have
moved
for
a
change
of
venue.
he
accepted
these
things
without
qualification
and
without
objection.
and
now,
he
comes
to
this
court
way
in
the
end,
and
says
despite
what
district
court
said,
despite
what
happened
prior
to
that
time,
i
want
you
to
reach
back
in
the
past
and
turn
me
lose
and
when
you
knew,
you
are
going
to
pull
the
flag
out
of
a
wrong
and
arrest
to
those
fellows
who
lose
and
they
are
all
in
there
having
understood,
after
they
committed
the
first
offense
and
what
did
the
penitentiary.
they
knew
what
“repetition”
meant
and
later
they
knew
what
“habituality”
meant.
everyone
on
the
penitentiary
knows
those
things
and
when
they
gladly
commit
that
next
offense,
they
do
it
knowing
that
they
can
be
put
away
for
life
which
shows
to
me
and
to
the
world
they
are
unfit
for
society.
thank
you
very
much.
