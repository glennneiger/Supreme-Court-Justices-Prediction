justice
abe
fortas
mr.
philips.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
phillips,
i'd
like
to
find
out
this
very
specifically
in
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
stewart
asked
a
little
while
ago.
that
is
under
the
old
procedure,
the
procedure
that
we
have
of
course
in
the
bell
case
and
in
other
two
cases,
(inaudible)
amendment
statute.
is
it
possible
to
--
for
the
defendant
by
his
own
action
to
withhold
from
the
jury
to
see
if
there
is
withheld
from
the
jury
information
as
to
his
prior
conviction?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now
i
want
to
take
it
through
that
very
carefully.
justice
abe
fortas
this
may
be
an
important
question.
first
under
article
64,
the
waiver
by
the
defendant
as
to
reading
the
indictment
and
the
making
of
proof
was
not
permitted.
justice
abe
fortas
under
article
--
under
the
old
procedure
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
statutes,
in
article
64
cases
that
is
to
say
capital
cases
a
waiver
procedure
was
not
permitted
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
that
in
capital
cases
the
prosecuting
had
to
read
to
the
jury
the
portion
of
the
indictment
charging
the
prior
convictions
and
it
also
had
to
make
proof
that
those
portions
of
the
indictment
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
so
that
in
article
64
that
is
capital
cases,
the
defendant
could
not
arrange
to
withhold
this
information
from
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
that's
number
one
and
number
two
let's
take
the
article
62
and
article
63
cases
that
is
to
say
cases
involving
less
than
capital
indictment.
as
i
understand
it,
recently
when
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
devised
a
procedure
by
which
the
defendant
could
avoid
the
reading
of
those
portions
of
the
indictment
and
the
defendant
could
also
avoid
the
state
making
proof
of
his
prior
convictions,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
but
even
in
those
situations
article
62
and
article
63,
did
the
jury
receive
information
as
to
prior
convictions
by
way
of
the
trial
judges'
charge
to
the
jury
or
by
way
of
the
prosecution
summation
or
both
of
them?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
current,
does
the
jury
fix
the
sentence
--
does
the
jury
fix
the
sentence
in
non-capital
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
well
would
the
--
would
the
trial
judge
in
such
cases
with
his
charge
to
the
jury
include
reference
to
the
prior
convictions,
does
you
answer
that
it
need
not?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
sure
there
would
be
grounds
for
reversal?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
case
under
this.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
now
i
want
you
to
be
careful
about
this
if
there
were
mr.
phillips
because
what
i
am
talking
about
is
a
trial
judge's
charge,
the
prosecutor
summation.
now
i
know
ex
parte
reyes
or
reyes
or
how
it
is
pronounced,
r-e-y-e-s.
now,
so
far
as
i
know
is,
you
made
mistakes
on
that
and
that
involved
the
reading
of
the
portions
of
the
indictment
but
it
did
not
involve
the
question
of
the
trial
judge's
charge
of
summation.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
matheny,
was
the
sentence
in
the
first
case
that
indicated
to
the
jury
on
the
second
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
first
sentence
was
2
to
15
years,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
there
must
be
under
some
circumstances
that
produces
relatively
light
sentence
for
murder
with
malice.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
allowed
to
develop
that
to
this
jury,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
went
to
the
jury
against
in
your
kind
of
case
as
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
by
getting
copy
of
the
sentence,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
verdict?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
would
include
the
sentence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
know
that
it's
2
to
15
years
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
there
were
some
litigating
circumstances,
are
you
telling
us
that
those
could
not
be
brought
out
in
the
second
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
may
ask
counsel
for
the
state
a
question,
can
i?
i
confess
i
still
have
some
confusion
as
to
one
of
the
matters
of
texas
law
that’s
involved
here.
do
the
latest
amendments
provide
–
are
they
applicable
to
capital
cases
as
well
as
to
non-capital
cases?
now,
i
know
this
question
was
asked
and
answered
several
times
yesterday
but
i
perhaps
misunderstood
or
perhaps
there
was
a
difference
in
the
answer
that
we
got
from
different
lawyers.
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
capital
cases
are
concerned,
the
texas
procedure
was
the
same
as
it
was
prior
to
january
1,
1966?
justice
abe
fortas
in
short,
that
the
defendant
cannot
wait
the
presentation
to
the
jury
of
the
fact
of
his
prior
convictions?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you
very
much.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
thank
you
so
much.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
as
if
i
may?
even
in
the
cases
where
there
was
a
stipulation
as
to
the
commission
of
the
prior
offenses,
was
it
customary
or
unusual
for
the
fact
of
the
prior
convictions
to
be
mentioned
on
the
bar
there?
justice
abe
fortas
where
there
was
a
stipulation,
was
it
customary
for
you
to
require
the
prior
convictions
to
be
mentioned
on
the
judges'
charge
to
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
it
was
totally
excluded
from,
not
only
as
an
evidentiary
matter
but
also
as
a
matter
of
statements
to
the
jury
or
to
the
individual
members
of
the
panel?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you
very
much.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
colvin,
isn't
there
a
difference
in
your
mind
and
experience
between
what
a
juror
may
know
on
the
one
hand
and
in
the
other
hand,
what
is
placed
on
the
record
and
brought
before
the
jury
and
instructed
to
consider
it
as
part
of
the
trial?
isn't
there
a
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
and
even
so,
mr.
colvin,
in
your
experience
as
lawyer,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
whether
juror
may
know
in
what
is
presented
in
evidence
in
pre
--
i
don't
know
what
was
done
in
your
case
in
the
preceding
case,
were
told
that
the
indictment
was
the
only
indictment
which
was
offer
in
evidence.
the
sentence
or
the
judgment
of
the
court
put
in
the
evidence,
two
policemen
were
put
on
the
stand
to
testify
to
the
conviction
and
the
picture
of
the
defendant
as
convict
with
his
convict
number
as
a
result
to
the
prior
conviction,
was
all
for
there
in
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
your
statement
that
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
considerable
significance,
legal
significance
between
that
and
the
general
hearsay
knowledge
of
the
juror.
justice
abe
fortas
this
defense
was
not
raised
on
behalf
of
mr.
reed
until
federal
habeas,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
was
stipulations
offered
by
the
defendant
ever
refute
by
the
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
so
at
least
two
cases
were
(voice
overlap)
than
to
stipulate
in
the
prosecution
judging?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don’t
want
to
make
that
as
a
concession
of
record,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
the
point
is
that
--
that
it
went
to
the
ju
--it
takes
as
it
so
has
made
a
revision
in
the
procedure
and
is
adopted
two-staged
procedure
and
the
recidivist
case
is
general
there.
and
in
the
driving
while
intoxicated
example
that
you
furthered,
i
think
i
understand
there’s
some
offer
of
this
about
4th
jurisdiction
and
so
on
but
you’re
not
saying
that
it’s
not
possible
to
preserve
the
principle
even
though
it
may
need
redrafting
of
the
statute
that
this
court
should
decide
that
you
cannot
introduce
prior
conviction
as
evidence
and
lecture
with
the
merits
of
the
second
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
understand
you
but
your
statute
replies
to
cases
drawn
after
january
1,
1966;
thus
provide
for
two-staged
procedure,
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
thereby
avoids
the
problem
that
has
been
--
we’ve
been
talking
about,
these
other
cases
that
is
to
save
the
bringing/placing
before
the
jury
evidence
as
to
prior
convictions
at
that
time
when
the
jury
has
been
sitting
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
not.

you
don’t
want
to
make
that
as
a
concession
of
record,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
the
point
is
that
--
that
it
went
to
the
ju
--it
takes
as
it
so
has
made
a
revision
in
the
procedure
and
is
adopted
two-staged
procedure
and
the
recidivist
case
is
general
there.
and
in
the
driving
while
intoxicated
example
that
you
furthered,
i
think
i
understand
there’s
some
offer
of
this
about
4th
jurisdiction
and
so
on
but
you’re
not
saying
that
it’s
not
possible
to
preserve
the
principle
even
though
it
may
need
redrafting
of
the
statute
that
this
court
should
decide
that
you
cannot
introduce
prior
conviction
as
evidence
and
lecture
with
the
merits
of
the
second
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
understand
you
but
your
statute
replies
to
cases
drawn
after
january
1,
1966;
thus
provide
for
two-staged
procedure,
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
thereby
avoids
the
problem
that
has
been
--
we’ve
been
talking
about,
these
other
cases
that
is
to
save
the
bringing/placing
before
the
jury
evidence
as
to
prior
convictions
at
that
time
when
the
jury
has
been
sitting
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
not.
