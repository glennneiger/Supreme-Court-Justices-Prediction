mr.
tom
r.
scott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
texas.
north
carolina
has
filed
an
amicus
brief.
in
this
case,
trial
was
to
a
jury
and
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
armed
robbery.
in
addition
to
the
allegations
of
the
primary
offense,
the
state
alleged
that
he
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
similar
crime.
this
was
done
pursuant
to
a
texas
procedure
which
permitted
the
allegation
of
the
prior
offense
for
purposes
of
enhancing
the
penalty
and
obtaining
a
longer
sentence
in
the
event
of
conviction.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
state
may
enter
use
to
a
jury
evidence
of
the
prior
offense
for
purposes
of
obtaining
an
increase
penalty
prior
to
a
finding
by
the
same
jury
and
the
same
time
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
this
is
a
question
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
there
have
been
other
recidivist
procedures
before
the
court
on
questions
of
notice
and
on
questions
of
equal
protection.
however,
none
of
these
cases
has
had
before
it
has
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
a
conflict
below
in
lower
court
authorities.
in
the
case
of
michelson
versus
the
united
states,
one
involving
the
cross-examination
of
character
witnesses,
mr.
justice
jackson
in
footnote
8
to
that
opinion
made
a
reference
to
the
possible
fact
that
such
a
procedure
would
be
acceptable.
however,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
--
that
this
question
is
not
decided
in
that
case
and
it
is
unclear
precisely
what
the
reference
in
that
case
had
reference
to
--
what
that
footnote
had
reference
to.
now
this
case,
involves
article
62
of
the
texas
penal
code.
that
section
of
the
penal
code
provides
a
mandatory
maximum
penalty
for
second
noncapital
offense
of
a
similar
nature.
the
validity
of
this
statute
is
not
contested.
the
policy
provision
of
this
statute
is
not
contested.
the
only
thing
which
is
contested
which
is
before
this
court
is
propriety
of
permitting
the
state
to
try
this
in
one
proceeding
and
one
hearing
in
which
the
same
jury
is
used
to
determine
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
at
the
same
time
is
informed
at
every
step
of
the
procedure
throughout
the
proceeding
of
the
accused
prior
criminal
record.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
correct.
it
has
been
amended.
it
was
amended
effective
january
1st
of
this
year.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
nearly
as
i
can
determine
it,
it
appears
to
be
23,
23
to
24.
there
are
some
appendices
that
have
been
attached
to
other
applications
for
certiorari.
i
have
not
searched
it
myself.
it's
difficult
to
determine
because
frequently
the
states
will
have
a
statute
which
appears
to
be
protected
and
entries
on
decisions
some
way
it
has
come
in
to
another
point.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
procedure
now
is
to
try
first
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
withhold
the
reading
of
the
allegations
in
the
indictment
which
relate
to
the
prior
offense.
then
if
there
is
an
issue,
if
there
is
a
return,
if
there
is
a
verdict
of
guilty,
that
portion
is
read
to
the
jury
and
then
they
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
the
person
who
have
previously
committed
a
prior
offense.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
it
is
included
in
the
indictment
but
it
is
not
read
at
the
jury.
there
are
some
exceptions
on
the
jurisdictional
type
offenses
but
others
are
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
or
any
of
these
three
cases.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
on
the
present
statute?
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
statute
in
effect
and
one
before
the
court
at
this
time.
the
one
in
effect
is
as
of
january
1st
of
the
statute
that's
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
no,
this
is
the
old
proceeding.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
if
he
admits
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
not
been
passed
on
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
but
i
would
assume
from
the
past
proceedings
that
that
would
be
permitted
and
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
there's
language
in
this
case
that
says
that.
they
–
i
think
it's
more
difficult
to
say
then
there
because
that
proceeding
came
in
late
in
the
effect
of
practice.
it
came
in
the
series
of
cases
decided
on
or
about
1963,
62
to
63.
they
are
cited
in
the
state's
brief.
i
think
we
referred
to
them
in
our
brief.
here
within
the
last
month,
it
appears
that
those
statutes
have
been
overruled.
i
mean
not
the
statute
but
those
cases
have
been
overruled
in
a
sort
of
go
fashion
with
the
case
of
ross
against
state
and
the
case
of
sims
against
state.
the
ross
case
is
cited
or
is
reported
in
401
s.w.
2d.
the
sims
case
was
reported
in
388
s.w.
2d.
now
there
are
three
cases
before
the
court
at
this
time
on
this
hearing.
the
spencer
case
involves
article
64
which
is
one
which
provides
that
a
–
in
a
capital
case
that
on
a
second
capital
case
a
conviction
will
result
in
not
less
than
a
life
sentence.
in
other
words,
there
can
be
death
or
life
and
so
they
have
to
make
a
finding
there.
the
reed
case
involves
a
question
of
habeas
corpus
case
which
comes
up
on
article
63
which
is
a
life
on
conviction
of
a
third
felony.
this
case
is
on
article
62
which
provides
for
a
--
the
maximum
offense
of
maximum
penalty
on
a
cert
finding
of
a
second
offense
under
a
--
of
a
similar
nature.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
right.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that's
right.
the
basic
question
and
the
question
before
the
court
which
i
understand
all
of
us
to
be
complaining
of
is
the
same,
the
question
of
reading
to
the
jury
informing
them
of
prior
complicity
in
crime.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that's
correct.
correct.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
there
were
no
stipulations
--
no
there
were
none
in
any
of
the
cases.
in
the
reed
case
he
was
not
permitted
to
stipulate,
on
spencer
case
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
the
capital
case,
they
said
that
since
he
had
the
option
since
the
jury
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
will
give
him
life
or
death
that
they
had
to
be
informed
with
this
and
they
would
not
permit
a
stipulation
even
though
it
was
unresolved.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
dispute,
the
rest
was
in
1963.
there
was
an
armed
robbery
of
a
grocery
store.
the
indictment
wasn't
drawn
as
we
have
said
allege
both
of
these
matters.
a
motion
to
quash
was
presented.
all
of
this
was
overruled.
on
the
trial,
the
presentation
of
evidence,
the
first
bit
of
evidence
to
come
in
were
fingerprints
and
picture.
now,
the
man
had
prison.
this
was
objected
to,
this
was
overruled.
then
a
fingerprint
expert
was
placed
on
the
stand
and
testified
that
he
had
taken
the
fingerprints
of
the
petitioner
and
he
had
taken
their
comparison
with
the
fingerprints
taken
from
the
federal
records
which
was
certified
and
place
in
evidence
over
this
same
objection
and
these
were
objected
to
and
again
overruled.
now
the
primary
evidence
in
the
case
is
summarize
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
primary
offense.
there's
a
prior
statement
of
what
happened
in
that
trial
of
the
case.
the
evidence
it
submitted.
the
defense
was
one
of
insanity.
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand,
he
did
not
offer
character.
the
charge
was
read
to
the
court
and
by
the
court
and
it
required
the
jury
to
consider.
it's
a
prolonged
charge
25
reports
from
page
25
to
page
32
of
the
record.
it
required
the
jury
to
consider
the
identity
of
the
petitioner
and
whether
or
not
he
committed
to
prior
offense
in
conjunction
with
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
charge
contains
admonitions
of
the
usual
fashion
to
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
question
of
prior
complicity
in
crime
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
finding
was
guilty.
it
was
found
that
he
was
the
same
person,
defense
of
insanity
was
refused.
the
--
an
appeal
was
taken
to
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
turned
down
and
this
case
was
brought
to
this
court
on
certiorari.
i
think
the
basic
dispute
between
the
parties
or
perhaps
the
basic
misunderstanding
is
best
exemplified
by
statements
contained
in
the
briefs
of
texas
and
north
carolina.
page
9
of
the
brief
of
texas,
this
statement
is
made
simply
logged
into
the
last
paragraph.
the
case
of
habitual
offenders,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
society
from
a
person
or
from
criminals
who
persists
in
the
commission
of
crime
and
by
serving
as
a
warning
to
first
offenders.
these
considerations
override
and
logically
so
the
rule
forbidding
the
introduction
and
proof
of
other
crimes.
north
carolina
states
the
same
concept
this
way
at
the
very
end
in
the
conclusion
of
their
brief.
when
the
state
legislature
says
that
a
prior
conviction
can
bring
about
increase
of
punishment
and
a
state
supreme
court
holds
that
the
issue
as
to
prior
conviction
can
be
tried
at
the
same
time
as
the
trial
of
the
subsequent
offense
and
why
should
a
criminal
be
protected
as
to
his
criminal
record.
answer
to
both
of
these
questions,
both
of
these
proposition
is
clear
until
the
man
is
found
guilty
of
the
second
offense
he
is
not
a
criminal
in
this
case.
he
is
not
a
habitual
criminal,
he
is
not
a
second
offender
and
there
is
no
reason
to
protect
society
against
him
until
he
is
given
a
fair
trial.
it
has
been
recognized
repeatedly
in
this
court
and
as
a
basic
proposition
that
by
fair
trial
before
a
fair
tribunal
is
a
basic
requirement
of
due
process.
as
early
as
1892
in
boyd
against
the
united
states.
it
was
recognized
that
fairness
required
one
--
that
one
who
had
a
prior
criminal
record
should
be
secure
from
the
injection
of
prior
criminality
into
the
case
unless
served.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
boyd
against
the
united
states
1892.
not
the
certainty
of
prejudice
but
the
probability
of
prejudice
which
is
sought
to
be
guarded
in
this
in
all
of
these
cases.
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
there
is
a
probability
of
prejudice.
in
marshall
against
the
united
states,
it
was
decided
that
in
this
court
recognized
that
reading
too
that
informing
the
jury
remands
past
criminal
history
to
something
that
cannot
be
removed
by
admonition.
in
that
case,
you
will
recall
the
jurors
read
in
the
newspapers,
seven
among
the
jurors
read
in
the
newspaper
account
about
the
prior
criminality
of
the
accused.
and
in
the
case,
the
district
judge
went
to
the
--
took
the
precaution
of
talking
to
all
seven
of
these
people
and
as
to
each
of
them
as
they
can
lay
that
aside.
and
this
is
the
case
under
the
federal
procedure
one
where
the
court
has
supervisory
jurisdiction.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
they
cannot
--
that
this
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
cannot
be
put
aside,
that
cannot
be
laid
aside
by
the
jury.
in
huron
against
state,
a
texas
case
40-30
s.w.
2d,
that
court
recognized
that
injecting
an
unrelated
offense
into
the
record,
into
the
trial
of
the
case
was
a
sort
of
thing
that
cannot
be
protected
against
and
which
would
cost
much
prejudice
in
the
words
of
the
court.
the
recent
case
of
seay
against
state,
a
texas
case
cited
in
the
brief,
the
court
there
said
that
it
would
then
deprive
him
of
an
impartial
jury
and
rob
him
of
the
fair
trial
to
which
he
is
entitled.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
correct.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
fact
that
it's
unnecessary
--
this
is
unnecessary
to
a
--
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
michelson,
as
it
is
acting
as
evidence
of
this
type
might
be
relevant
but
the
probability
of
harm,
the
probability
of
prejudice
due
to
defendant
is
so
great
that
it
is
excluded.
in
these
cases
the
court
is
not
admitting
it
on
any
question
of
defense.
it's
not
admitting
it
to
show
propensity
to
commit
the
crime
that
he
is
being
admitted
for
the
sole
reason
of
enhancement
that
shown
by
the
texas
procedure
which
were
committed
to
be
excluded
if
it
were
stipulated.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
it
could
be
argued
that
it
wouldn't.
i
think
that
in
michelson
case,
it's
recognize
that
that
type
of
evidence
might
have
relevance
but
if
the
relevance
is
so
borderline,
so
small
and
embraced
the
danger
of
prejudice
is
so
great
that
all
–
with
all
jurisdiction
excluded
and
as
part
of
the
trial
of
the
case
in
chief,
i
believe
that
that
require
to
the
stand.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
texas
speaks
in
terms
of
the
being
here
on
texas
court.
i
think
that
probably
there
is
after
shorthand
raised
for
the
presence
of
opinion
and
perhaps
it
is
relevant
for
the
sole
--
it
is
relevant
and
it's
so
prejudicial
and
it
is
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
it
is
a
denial
by
the
--
and
it
is
so
prejudicial
this
order
--
is
at
the
weight
so
heavy.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
they
hold
and
they're
irrelevant.
that's
certainly
implicit
in
fact
that
they
excluded
if
it
is
stipulated.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
on
the
relevancy
question?
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
think
its
uniform.
as
far
as
i
can
tell
that
all
of
them
exclude
it.
there
may
be
some
other
expressions
at
stake
that
there
is
shadow
line,
border
line
and
relevancy
but
that
they
exclude
it
because
of
the
great
danger
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
know
of
no
case
affirming
it.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes
that
is
the
question.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes
sir.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
his
right
to
an
impartial
--
impartial
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
article
6.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
or
an
impartial
tribunal
is
interpreted
in
these
cases
which
have
recognized
the
right
to
an
impartial
tribunal.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
question
of
the
evidence,
question
of
evidence
in
the
case
goes
to
be
two
prejudices,
the
prejudice
in
gender
by
this
type
of
evidence,
this
evidence
of
a
prior
crime,
that
is
the
significance
of
the
evidence.
the
evidence
could
be
admitted
through
an
alternate
procedure
--
an
alternate
procedure
such
as
one
that
has
now
established
in
fact.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
unless
it
regarded
with
stringent
safeguards.
safeguards
to
--
that
would
determine
types
of
evidence,
the
types
of
cases
that
could
be
admitted
perhaps
something
closely
related.
now,
our
exception
of
the
court
to
the
exclusion
which
permit
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
right.
certainly
those
are
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
but
there
are
procedures,
and
procedure
that
we
contended
that
this
is
one
of
those
procedures
that
is
so
far
beyond
the
realm
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
close
question
i
would
concede
that
the
reference
that
the
benefit
should
go
to
the
state
in
the
question
of
this
type
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
kind
of
question
of
this
case
and
the
other
cases
here
before
the
court
present
the
kind
of
a
policy
decision,
a
question
which
is
so
clear
as
to
show
to
the
court
or
to
present
a
question
which
oversteps
the
bounds
of
due
process.
that
is
our
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
sixth,
the
fifth
and
due
process.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
inherent
prejudice
is
introduced
the
moment
the
indictment
is
read
to
them
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
reading
of
the
indictment
the
introduction
of
evidence
the
charge
itself
all
of
these
things
go
unrelated
to
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt,
the
central
question
on
which
the
defendant
is
on
trial.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
of
course
on
cases
which
are
closely
related
of
things
of
that
type
and
they
are
--
there
are
certainly
cases
where
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
we
don't
feel
that
the
question
is
shadowy.
the
question
here
before
the
court
is
one
where
a
man
is
all
--
any
crime
can
be
introduced
against
him.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
statistically,
that
could
be
looked
to
and
perhaps
could
be
argued.
that
that
kind
of
thing
is
so
happened,
because
erroneously
that
it
has
been
marked
down,
it
has
been,
it
has
been
gone
against
and
in
other
cases.
it's
recognized
in
michelson
that
it
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
because
in
this
case,
the
state,
no
one
is
contending
that
this
is
being
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
proving
propensity.
it
is
being
admitted
for
the
sole
purpose
of
obtaining
a
sentence,
of
obtaining
a
greater
sentence
in
a
procedure
where
they
can
do
that
just
as
in
--
when
they
are
different
and
a
protective
procedure.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
where
the
state
has
not
continued
there
and
where
it
has
not
provided
any
--
whether
they
have
not
provided
any
protective
procedure
that
surrounds
the
provision
under
which
they
are
admitted.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
court
to
limit
our
decision
in
this
case
that
it
would
be
their
opinion
to
hold
open
the
possibility
that
in
a
proper
case,
a
proper
statute
could
be
passed.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
in
the
lane
case,
lane
against
warden
that
this
procedure
does
violate
due
process.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
1963.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
no
it
is
not.
in
barron
against
state,
massachusetts
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
barron,
that
was
1922
or
3.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
there
is
english
authority
uphold.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
far
as
i
know
that
is
the
first
question,
first
case
to
pass
on
the
constitutional
question
and
others
may
have
passed
on
the
evidentiary
side.
that
would
be
the
first
state
signature
that
passed.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
graham
case
would
indicate
that
they
have
a
long
history
to
take
back
at
least
as
far
as
1870.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
believe
that's
the
case.
there
have
already
have
been
that
because
of
the
virginia
statute
involved
there
and
brought
over
in
west
virginia,
at
least
again
in
1830.
the
history
of
them
in
england
go
back
even
farther
than
that
in
as
far
as
it
held
in
graham.
they
have
a
long
history.
it's
interesting
that
the
english
statute
was
passed,
a
statute
protective
statute
prohibiting
this
was
passed
two
years
after
the
case
which
upheld
the
admissibility
of
this
type
of
evidence
and
in
the
preamble
of
that
statute
they
point
out
that
there
might
be
doubts
as
to
whether
it
denies
the
defendant
an
impartial
trial
and
a
fair
determination
of
his
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
question
is
up
to
the
court
but
i
would
say
that
this
does
not
--
i
would
say
that
it
cannot
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
would
me
my
contention.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
would
say
that
it
would
not,
it
would
not.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
those
cases,
you
have
a
reason.
there's
a
reason
for
admitting.
there
is
a
relevant
reason
recognized.
in
these
cases,
it
is
unnecessary.
there's
no
necessity
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
it
is
of
course
relevant
to
the
question
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
because
this
type
of
evidence
has
been
recognized
in
weighing
so
heavily
with
the
court
while
with
the
jury
as
to
overweigh
their
consideration
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
decide
that.
the
state
makes
several
contentions.
they
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
this
case,
it's
irrelevant
to
any
issue
before
that
has
to
be
decided
at
this
time
by
the
jury.
those
cases
planned
or
designed
the
fingerprint
of
the
same
type
of
crime,
all
of
these
things
are
relevant
to
the
present
guilt
on
the
primary
offense.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
certainly.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
this
is
prejudicial
and
that's
admitted.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
unfairly
prejudicial
because
it
goes
to
no
question.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that's
correct
and
it's
unfair
because
there
is
a
simple
means,
there
are
other
simple
means
of
protecting
against
this
which
the
state
knows
of
and
has
known
of
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
it
was
the
case
in
lane,
they
all
sort
of
amended
their
statute.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
distinction
in
all
of
these
cases
is
that
the
defendant
there
is
attempting
to
gain
some
advantage.
i
would
say
that
that
would
still
be
permitted.
if
he
is
willing
to
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
if
he
is
willing
to
take
--
to
attempt
to
gain
an
advantage
by
(inaudible),
well
certainly
been
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
cross-examine
on
his
prior
criminal
record.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
because
he
has
taken
as
to
him,
he
is
gone
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
he
has
elected
freely.
yes,
it
is
a
waiver
concept.
he
has
elected
to
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
well
this
case
--
that
case
of
course
is
not
involved.
that
question
is
not
involved
in
their
case
so
the
case
is
not
before
the
court
here.
but
i
would
be
willing
to
say
that
in
our
case
that
time
that
it
could
--
that
it
would
be
upheld.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
if
he
were
allowed
to
take
the
stand
by
showing
this
type
of
--
without
showing
his
prior
criminality
he
would
be
standing
without
state
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
they
don't.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
under
patton
or
(inaudible)
is
the
only
case
--
are
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
sir.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
argument
which
the
state
is
now
giving
is
that
the
right
can
stipulate
--
the
opportunity
to
stipulate
is
a
good
protection
for
the
defendant
that
it
protects
his
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
it
affects
they
are
arguing
that
he
can
--
that
it
is
prejudicial,
they
are
admitting
it
is
prejudicial
and
they
are
saying
that
he
can
purchase
a
fair
trial
by
admitting
a
major
portion
of
the
state's
case.
if
this
is
their
argument,
we
say
that
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
here
and
be
against
self-incrimination
against
supplying
a
vital
part
a
link
a
vital
link
in
the
state's
case.
now
even
with
regard
to
the
stipulation
there
are
these
cases,
there
is
the
pitcock
case
in
1963
which
as
far
as
i
know
was
the
first
to
suggest
the
so-called
stipulation.
here
they
had
it
since
1907
and
finally
in
1963
they
devised
this
so-called
protective
procedure
of
stipulation.
but
here
in
1966,
they
have
overruled
those
cases
or
at
least
they
have
severely
limited
them
to
the
proposition
that
if
the
trial
judge
wishes,
he
can
refuse
to
accept
the
stipulation
in
a
non-capital
case
as
is
not
a
reversible
error.
both
that
case
with
ross
against
texas
401
s.w.
2d
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
but
the
case
prior
to
the
19
--
the
1st
of
january
reaching
appeal
in
1966
but
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
--
prior
to
that.
they
back
away
for
this
protective
procedure
without
citation
of
these
cases
without
overruling
they
permit
the
trial
court
that
it
permit
the
prosecution
to
go
ahead
and
read
into
evidence
the
proof
of
the
prior
offense.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
ross
against
state
401
s.w.
2d.
it's
also
foreshadowed
in
simms
against
texas.
most
of
these
cases
come
out
of
tarrant
county.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
388
s.w.
2d.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
with
regard
to
the
earlier
cases
which
you
referred
to
this
as
being
inseparable
procedure,
the
oyler
case,
the
graham
case.
the
graham
case
is
interesting
because
there
they
were
using
a
split
proceeding.
back
at
that
time,
they
--
the
person
who
was
being
tried
long
after,
long
after
the
time
that
he
had
been
primarily
convicted.
they
brought
him
back
in,
tried
him
again
and
he
was
complaining
of
the
split
procedure.
he
was
complaining
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
given
those
on
the
earlier
trial.
in
that
case,
(inaudible),
just
as
you
stated
that
that
is
permissive
procedure
but
that
it
was
not
required.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
to
give
a
greater
penalty
as
to
the
portion
granted
in
the
brief
that
it
would
be
an
example
to
multiple
offenders
that
deter
multiple
offenders
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
the
way
i
see
it
and
also
they
could
take
him
out
of
society.
that
is
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
--
as
i
understand
the
argument
that
is
the
proposition
advised
by
the
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
no,
it
is
not.
we
have
no
argument
to
the
procedure
having
recidivist
statute.
our
only
argument
is
the
way
in
which
it
is
applied
the
application
of
it
through
this
in
article
672.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
texas.
north
carolina
has
filed
an
amicus
brief.
in
this
case,
trial
was
to
a
jury
and
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
armed
robbery.
in
addition
to
the
allegations
of
the
primary
offense,
the
state
alleged
that
he
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
similar
crime.
this
was
done
pursuant
to
a
texas
procedure
which
permitted
the
allegation
of
the
prior
offense
for
purposes
of
enhancing
the
penalty
and
obtaining
a
longer
sentence
in
the
event
of
conviction.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
state
may
enter
use
to
a
jury
evidence
of
the
prior
offense
for
purposes
of
obtaining
an
increase
penalty
prior
to
a
finding
by
the
same
jury
and
the
same
time
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
this
is
a
question
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
there
have
been
other
recidivist
procedures
before
the
court
on
questions
of
notice
and
on
questions
of
equal
protection.
however,
none
of
these
cases
has
had
before
it
has
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
a
conflict
below
in
lower
court
authorities.
in
the
case
of
michelson
versus
the
united
states,
one
involving
the
cross-examination
of
character
witnesses,
mr.
justice
jackson
in
footnote
8
to
that
opinion
made
a
reference
to
the
possible
fact
that
such
a
procedure
would
be
acceptable.
however,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
--
that
this
question
is
not
decided
in
that
case
and
it
is
unclear
precisely
what
the
reference
in
that
case
had
reference
to
--
what
that
footnote
had
reference
to.
now
this
case,
involves
article
62
of
the
texas
penal
code.
that
section
of
the
penal
code
provides
a
mandatory
maximum
penalty
for
second
noncapital
offense
of
a
similar
nature.
the
validity
of
this
statute
is
not
contested.
the
policy
provision
of
this
statute
is
not
contested.
the
only
thing
which
is
contested
which
is
before
this
court
is
propriety
of
permitting
the
state
to
try
this
in
one
proceeding
and
one
hearing
in
which
the
same
jury
is
used
to
determine
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
at
the
same
time
is
informed
at
every
step
of
the
procedure
throughout
the
proceeding
of
the
accused
prior
criminal
record.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
correct.
it
has
been
amended.
it
was
amended
effective
january
1st
of
this
year.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
nearly
as
i
can
determine
it,
it
appears
to
be
23,
23
to
24.
there
are
some
appendices
that
have
been
attached
to
other
applications
for
certiorari.
i
have
not
searched
it
myself.
it's
difficult
to
determine
because
frequently
the
states
will
have
a
statute
which
appears
to
be
protected
and
entries
on
decisions
some
way
it
has
come
in
to
another
point.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
procedure
now
is
to
try
first
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
withhold
the
reading
of
the
allegations
in
the
indictment
which
relate
to
the
prior
offense.
then
if
there
is
an
issue,
if
there
is
a
return,
if
there
is
a
verdict
of
guilty,
that
portion
is
read
to
the
jury
and
then
they
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
the
person
who
have
previously
committed
a
prior
offense.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
it
is
included
in
the
indictment
but
it
is
not
read
at
the
jury.
there
are
some
exceptions
on
the
jurisdictional
type
offenses
but
others
are
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
or
any
of
these
three
cases.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
on
the
present
statute?
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
statute
in
effect
and
one
before
the
court
at
this
time.
the
one
in
effect
is
as
of
january
1st
of
the
statute
that's
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
no,
this
is
the
old
proceeding.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
if
he
admits
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
not
been
passed
on
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
but
i
would
assume
from
the
past
proceedings
that
that
would
be
permitted
and
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
there's
language
in
this
case
that
says
that.
they
–
i
think
it's
more
difficult
to
say
then
there
because
that
proceeding
came
in
late
in
the
effect
of
practice.
it
came
in
the
series
of
cases
decided
on
or
about
1963,
62
to
63.
they
are
cited
in
the
state's
brief.
i
think
we
referred
to
them
in
our
brief.
here
within
the
last
month,
it
appears
that
those
statutes
have
been
overruled.
i
mean
not
the
statute
but
those
cases
have
been
overruled
in
a
sort
of
go
fashion
with
the
case
of
ross
against
state
and
the
case
of
sims
against
state.
the
ross
case
is
cited
or
is
reported
in
401
s.w.
2d.
the
sims
case
was
reported
in
388
s.w.
2d.
now
there
are
three
cases
before
the
court
at
this
time
on
this
hearing.
the
spencer
case
involves
article
64
which
is
one
which
provides
that
a
–
in
a
capital
case
that
on
a
second
capital
case
a
conviction
will
result
in
not
less
than
a
life
sentence.
in
other
words,
there
can
be
death
or
life
and
so
they
have
to
make
a
finding
there.
the
reed
case
involves
a
question
of
habeas
corpus
case
which
comes
up
on
article
63
which
is
a
life
on
conviction
of
a
third
felony.
this
case
is
on
article
62
which
provides
for
a
--
the
maximum
offense
of
maximum
penalty
on
a
cert
finding
of
a
second
offense
under
a
--
of
a
similar
nature.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
right.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that's
right.
the
basic
question
and
the
question
before
the
court
which
i
understand
all
of
us
to
be
complaining
of
is
the
same,
the
question
of
reading
to
the
jury
informing
them
of
prior
complicity
in
crime.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that's
correct.
correct.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
there
were
no
stipulations
--
no
there
were
none
in
any
of
the
cases.
in
the
reed
case
he
was
not
permitted
to
stipulate,
on
spencer
case
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
the
capital
case,
they
said
that
since
he
had
the
option
since
the
jury
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
will
give
him
life
or
death
that
they
had
to
be
informed
with
this
and
they
would
not
permit
a
stipulation
even
though
it
was
unresolved.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
dispute,
the
rest
was
in
1963.
there
was
an
armed
robbery
of
a
grocery
store.
the
indictment
wasn't
drawn
as
we
have
said
allege
both
of
these
matters.
a
motion
to
quash
was
presented.
all
of
this
was
overruled.
on
the
trial,
the
presentation
of
evidence,
the
first
bit
of
evidence
to
come
in
were
fingerprints
and
picture.
now,
the
man
had
prison.
this
was
objected
to,
this
was
overruled.
then
a
fingerprint
expert
was
placed
on
the
stand
and
testified
that
he
had
taken
the
fingerprints
of
the
petitioner
and
he
had
taken
their
comparison
with
the
fingerprints
taken
from
the
federal
records
which
was
certified
and
place
in
evidence
over
this
same
objection
and
these
were
objected
to
and
again
overruled.
now
the
primary
evidence
in
the
case
is
summarize
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
primary
offense.
there's
a
prior
statement
of
what
happened
in
that
trial
of
the
case.
the
evidence
it
submitted.
the
defense
was
one
of
insanity.
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand,
he
did
not
offer
character.
the
charge
was
read
to
the
court
and
by
the
court
and
it
required
the
jury
to
consider.
it's
a
prolonged
charge
25
reports
from
page
25
to
page
32
of
the
record.
it
required
the
jury
to
consider
the
identity
of
the
petitioner
and
whether
or
not
he
committed
to
prior
offense
in
conjunction
with
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
charge
contains
admonitions
of
the
usual
fashion
to
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
question
of
prior
complicity
in
crime
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
finding
was
guilty.
it
was
found
that
he
was
the
same
person,
defense
of
insanity
was
refused.
the
--
an
appeal
was
taken
to
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
turned
down
and
this
case
was
brought
to
this
court
on
certiorari.
i
think
the
basic
dispute
between
the
parties
or
perhaps
the
basic
misunderstanding
is
best
exemplified
by
statements
contained
in
the
briefs
of
texas
and
north
carolina.
page
9
of
the
brief
of
texas,
this
statement
is
made
simply
logged
into
the
last
paragraph.
the
case
of
habitual
offenders,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
society
from
a
person
or
from
criminals
who
persists
in
the
commission
of
crime
and
by
serving
as
a
warning
to
first
offenders.
these
considerations
override
and
logically
so
the
rule
forbidding
the
introduction
and
proof
of
other
crimes.
north
carolina
states
the
same
concept
this
way
at
the
very
end
in
the
conclusion
of
their
brief.
when
the
state
legislature
says
that
a
prior
conviction
can
bring
about
increase
of
punishment
and
a
state
supreme
court
holds
that
the
issue
as
to
prior
conviction
can
be
tried
at
the
same
time
as
the
trial
of
the
subsequent
offense
and
why
should
a
criminal
be
protected
as
to
his
criminal
record.
answer
to
both
of
these
questions,
both
of
these
proposition
is
clear
until
the
man
is
found
guilty
of
the
second
offense
he
is
not
a
criminal
in
this
case.
he
is
not
a
habitual
criminal,
he
is
not
a
second
offender
and
there
is
no
reason
to
protect
society
against
him
until
he
is
given
a
fair
trial.
it
has
been
recognized
repeatedly
in
this
court
and
as
a
basic
proposition
that
by
fair
trial
before
a
fair
tribunal
is
a
basic
requirement
of
due
process.
as
early
as
1892
in
boyd
against
the
united
states.
it
was
recognized
that
fairness
required
one
--
that
one
who
had
a
prior
criminal
record
should
be
secure
from
the
injection
of
prior
criminality
into
the
case
unless
served.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
boyd
against
the
united
states
1892.
not
the
certainty
of
prejudice
but
the
probability
of
prejudice
which
is
sought
to
be
guarded
in
this
in
all
of
these
cases.
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
there
is
a
probability
of
prejudice.
in
marshall
against
the
united
states,
it
was
decided
that
in
this
court
recognized
that
reading
too
that
informing
the
jury
remands
past
criminal
history
to
something
that
cannot
be
removed
by
admonition.
in
that
case,
you
will
recall
the
jurors
read
in
the
newspapers,
seven
among
the
jurors
read
in
the
newspaper
account
about
the
prior
criminality
of
the
accused.
and
in
the
case,
the
district
judge
went
to
the
--
took
the
precaution
of
talking
to
all
seven
of
these
people
and
as
to
each
of
them
as
they
can
lay
that
aside.
and
this
is
the
case
under
the
federal
procedure
one
where
the
court
has
supervisory
jurisdiction.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
they
cannot
--
that
this
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
cannot
be
put
aside,
that
cannot
be
laid
aside
by
the
jury.
in
huron
against
state,
a
texas
case
40-30
s.w.
2d,
that
court
recognized
that
injecting
an
unrelated
offense
into
the
record,
into
the
trial
of
the
case
was
a
sort
of
thing
that
cannot
be
protected
against
and
which
would
cost
much
prejudice
in
the
words
of
the
court.
the
recent
case
of
seay
against
state,
a
texas
case
cited
in
the
brief,
the
court
there
said
that
it
would
then
deprive
him
of
an
impartial
jury
and
rob
him
of
the
fair
trial
to
which
he
is
entitled.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
correct.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
fact
that
it's
unnecessary
--
this
is
unnecessary
to
a
--
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
michelson,
as
it
is
acting
as
evidence
of
this
type
might
be
relevant
but
the
probability
of
harm,
the
probability
of
prejudice
due
to
defendant
is
so
great
that
it
is
excluded.
in
these
cases
the
court
is
not
admitting
it
on
any
question
of
defense.
it's
not
admitting
it
to
show
propensity
to
commit
the
crime
that
he
is
being
admitted
for
the
sole
reason
of
enhancement
that
shown
by
the
texas
procedure
which
were
committed
to
be
excluded
if
it
were
stipulated.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
it
could
be
argued
that
it
wouldn't.
i
think
that
in
michelson
case,
it's
recognize
that
that
type
of
evidence
might
have
relevance
but
if
the
relevance
is
so
borderline,
so
small
and
embraced
the
danger
of
prejudice
is
so
great
that
all
–
with
all
jurisdiction
excluded
and
as
part
of
the
trial
of
the
case
in
chief,
i
believe
that
that
require
to
the
stand.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
texas
speaks
in
terms
of
the
being
here
on
texas
court.
i
think
that
probably
there
is
after
shorthand
raised
for
the
presence
of
opinion
and
perhaps
it
is
relevant
for
the
sole
--
it
is
relevant
and
it's
so
prejudicial
and
it
is
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
it
is
a
denial
by
the
--
and
it
is
so
prejudicial
this
order
--
is
at
the
weight
so
heavy.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
they
hold
and
they're
irrelevant.
that's
certainly
implicit
in
fact
that
they
excluded
if
it
is
stipulated.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
on
the
relevancy
question?
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
think
its
uniform.
as
far
as
i
can
tell
that
all
of
them
exclude
it.
there
may
be
some
other
expressions
at
stake
that
there
is
shadow
line,
border
line
and
relevancy
but
that
they
exclude
it
because
of
the
great
danger
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
know
of
no
case
affirming
it.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes
that
is
the
question.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes
sir.
mr.

article
6.
mr.
tom

scott
that
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
or
an
impartial
tribunal
is
interpreted
in
these
cases
which
have
recognized
the
right
to
an
impartial
tribunal.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
question
of
the
evidence,
question
of
evidence
in
the
case
goes
to
be
two
prejudices,
the
prejudice
in
gender
by
this
type
of
evidence,
this
evidence
of
a
prior
crime,
that
is
the
significance
of
the
evidence.
the
evidence
could
be
admitted
through
an
alternate
procedure
--
an
alternate
procedure
such
as
one
that
has
now
established
in
fact.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
unless
it
regarded
with
stringent
safeguards.
safeguards
to
--
that
would
determine
types
of
evidence,
the
types
of
cases
that
could
be
admitted
perhaps
something
closely
related.
now,
our
exception
of
the
court
to
the
exclusion
which
permit
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
right.
certainly
those
are
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
but
there
are
procedures,
and
procedure
that
we
contended
that
this
is
one
of
those
procedures
that
is
so
far
beyond
the
realm
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
close
question
i
would
concede
that
the
reference
that
the
benefit
should
go
to
the
state
in
the
question
of
this
type
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
kind
of
question
of
this
case
and
the
other
cases
here
before
the
court
present
the
kind
of
a
policy
decision,
a
question
which
is
so
clear
as
to
show
to
the
court
or
to
present
a
question
which
oversteps
the
bounds
of
due
process.
that
is
our
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
sixth,
the
fifth
and
due
process.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
inherent
prejudice
is
introduced
the
moment
the
indictment
is
read
to
them
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
reading
of
the
indictment
the
introduction
of
evidence
the
charge
itself
all
of
these
things
go
unrelated
to
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt,
the
central
question
on
which
the
defendant
is
on
trial.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
of
course
on
cases
which
are
closely
related
of
things
of
that
type
and
they
are
--
there
are
certainly
cases
where
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
we
don't
feel
that
the
question
is
shadowy.
the
question
here
before
the
court
is
one
where
a
man
is
all
--
any
crime
can
be
introduced
against
him.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
statistically,
that
could
be
looked
to
and
perhaps
could
be
argued.
that
that
kind
of
thing
is
so
happened,
because
erroneously
that
it
has
been
marked
down,
it
has
been,
it
has
been
gone
against
and
in
other
cases.
it's
recognized
in
michelson
that
it
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
because
in
this
case,
the
state,
no
one
is
contending
that
this
is
being
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
proving
propensity.
it
is
being
admitted
for
the
sole
purpose
of
obtaining
a
sentence,
of
obtaining
a
greater
sentence
in
a
procedure
where
they
can
do
that
just
as
in
--
when
they
are
different
and
a
protective
procedure.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
where
the
state
has
not
continued
there
and
where
it
has
not
provided
any
--
whether
they
have
not
provided
any
protective
procedure
that
surrounds
the
provision
under
which
they
are
admitted.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
court
to
limit
our
decision
in
this
case
that
it
would
be
their
opinion
to
hold
open
the
possibility
that
in
a
proper
case,
a
proper
statute
could
be
passed.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
in
the
lane
case,
lane
against
warden
that
this
procedure
does
violate
due
process.

tom

scott
1963.
mr.
tom

no
it
is
not.
in
barron
against
state,
massachusetts
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
barron,
that
was
1922
or
3.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
there
is
english
authority
uphold.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
far
as
i
know
that
is
the
first
question,
first
case
to
pass
on
the
constitutional
question
and
others
may
have
passed
on
the
evidentiary
side.
that
would
be
the
first
state
signature
that
passed.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
graham
case
would
indicate
that
they
have
a
long
history
to
take
back
at
least
as
far
as
1870.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
believe
that's
the
case.
there
have
already
have
been
that
because
of
the
virginia
statute
involved
there
and
brought
over
in
west
virginia,
at
least
again
in
1830.
the
history
of
them
in
england
go
back
even
farther
than
that
in
as
far
as
it
held
in
graham.
they
have
a
long
history.
it's
interesting
that
the
english
statute
was
passed,
a
statute
protective
statute
prohibiting
this
was
passed
two
years
after
the
case
which
upheld
the
admissibility
of
this
type
of
evidence
and
in
the
preamble
of
that
statute
they
point
out
that
there
might
be
doubts
as
to
whether
it
denies
the
defendant
an
impartial
trial
and
a
fair
determination
of
his
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
question
is
up
to
the
court
but
i
would
say
that
this
does
not
--
i
would
say
that
it
cannot
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
would
me
my
contention.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
i
would
say
that
it
would
not,
it
would
not.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
those
cases,
you
have
a
reason.
there's
a
reason
for
admitting.
there
is
a
relevant
reason
recognized.
in
these
cases,
it
is
unnecessary.
there's
no
necessity
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
it
is
of
course
relevant
to
the
question
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
because
this
type
of
evidence
has
been
recognized
in
weighing
so
heavily
with
the
court
while
with
the
jury
as
to
overweigh
their
consideration
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
decide
that.
the
state
makes
several
contentions.
they
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
in
this
case,
it's
irrelevant
to
any
issue
before
that
has
to
be
decided
at
this
time
by
the
jury.
those
cases
planned
or
designed
the
fingerprint
of
the
same
type
of
crime,
all
of
these
things
are
relevant
to
the
present
guilt
on
the
primary
offense.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
certainly.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
this
is
prejudicial
and
that's
admitted.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
unfairly
prejudicial
because
it
goes
to
no
question.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that's
correct
and
it's
unfair
because
there
is
a
simple
means,
there
are
other
simple
means
of
protecting
against
this
which
the
state
knows
of
and
has
known
of
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
as
it
was
the
case
in
lane,
they
all
sort
of
amended
their
statute.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
distinction
in
all
of
these
cases
is
that
the
defendant
there
is
attempting
to
gain
some
advantage.
i
would
say
that
that
would
still
be
permitted.
if
he
is
willing
to
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
if
he
is
willing
to
take
--
to
attempt
to
gain
an
advantage
by
(inaudible),
well
certainly
been
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
cross-examine
on
his
prior
criminal
record.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
correct.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
because
he
has
taken
as
to
him,
he
is
gone
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
he
has
elected
freely.
yes,
it
is
a
waiver
concept.
he
has
elected
to
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
well
this
case
--
that
case
of
course
is
not
involved.
that
question
is
not
involved
in
their
case
so
the
case
is
not
before
the
court
here.
but
i
would
be
willing
to
say
that
in
our
case
that
time
that
it
could
--
that
it
would
be
upheld.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
if
he
were
allowed
to
take
the
stand
by
showing
this
type
of
--
without
showing
his
prior
criminality
he
would
be
standing
without
state
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
they
don't.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
under
patton
or
(inaudible)
is
the
only
case
--
are
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
yes,
sir.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
the
argument
which
the
state
is
now
giving
is
that
the
right
can
stipulate
--
the
opportunity
to
stipulate
is
a
good
protection
for
the
defendant
that
it
protects
his
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
it
affects
they
are
arguing
that
he
can
--
that
it
is
prejudicial,
they
are
admitting
it
is
prejudicial
and
they
are
saying
that
he
can
purchase
a
fair
trial
by
admitting
a
major
portion
of
the
state's
case.
if
this
is
their
argument,
we
say
that
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
here
and
be
against
self-incrimination
against
supplying
a
vital
part
a
link
a
vital
link
in
the
state's
case.
now
even
with
regard
to
the
stipulation
there
are
these
cases,
there
is
the
pitcock
case
in
1963
which
as
far
as
i
know
was
the
first
to
suggest
the
so-called
stipulation.
here
they
had
it
since
1907
and
finally
in
1963
they
devised
this
so-called
protective
procedure
of
stipulation.
but
here
in
1966,
they
have
overruled
those
cases
or
at
least
they
have
severely
limited
them
to
the
proposition
that
if
the
trial
judge
wishes,
he
can
refuse
to
accept
the
stipulation
in
a
non-capital
case
as
is
not
a
reversible
error.
both
that
case
with

the

the

of

reaching
appeal
in

but
--
mr.

--
prior
to
that.
they
back
away
for
this
protective
procedure
without
citation
of
these
cases
without
overruling
they
permit
the
trial
court
that
it
permit
the
prosecution
to
go
ahead
and
read
into
evidence
the
proof
of
the
prior
offense.

it's

mr.

with
regard
to
the
earlier
cases
which
you
referred
to
this
as
being
inseparable
procedure,
the
oyler
case,
the
graham
case.
the
graham
case
is
interesting
because
there
they
were
using
a
split
proceeding.
back
at
that
time,
they
--
the
person
who
was
being
tried
long
after,
long
after
the
time
that
he
had
been
primarily
convicted.
they
brought
him
back
in,
tried
him
again
and
he
was
complaining
of
the
split
procedure.
he
was
complaining
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
given
those
on
the
earlier
trial.
in
that
case,
(inaudible),
just
as
you
stated
that
that
is
permissive
procedure
but
that
it
was
not
required.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
to
give
a
greater
penalty
as
to
the
portion
granted
in
the
brief
that
it
would
be
an
example
to
multiple
offenders
that
deter
multiple
offenders
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
the
way
i
see
it
and
also
they
could
take
him
out
of
society.
that
is
--
mr.
tom
r.
scott
that
is
--
as
i
understand
the
argument
that
is
the
proposition
advised
by
the
case.
mr.
tom
r.
scott
no,
it
is
not.
we
have
no
argument
to
the
procedure
having
recidivist
statute.
our
only
argument
is
the
way
in
which
it
is
applied
the
application
of
it
through
this
in
article
672.
