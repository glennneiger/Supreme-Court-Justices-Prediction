chief
justice
earl
warren
number
69,
robert
a.
bell,
jr.
petitioner
versus
texas.
mr.
scott.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
present
statute
what
happens
if
he
admits
the
priors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
the
new
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
say
what
is
the
new
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
man
is
arraigned
he
said,
“i
lead
not
guilty
but
i
admit
my
priors.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
it
is
at
way
another
–
in
some
other
states
where
he
admits
the
priors
and
they
cannot
be
used
on
the
trial
subsequent
of
the
new
offense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
denies
them
they
can
be.
now,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
these
recidivist
statute
first
come
into
existence
in
this
country,
do
you
happen
to
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1870?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
sustain
your
position
would
that
have
any
effect
on
the
proof
of
similar
offenses
to
show
general
plan
or
scheme
to
negative
innocent
intent
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
three
minutes
at
the
end
of
your
argument
to
conclude
if
you
wish
and
you
may
have
that
much
time
also.
mr.
phillips,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phillips,
may
i
ask
you
at
the
outset
if
you
tell
us
what
the
elements
of
the
statute
is
the
one
under
which
this
case
is
to
be
governed
and
then
the
change
that
was
made
in
it
recently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
a
like
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
may
i
--
may
i
just
interrupt
you
once
more,
suppose
on
his
arraignment
he
plead
not
guilty
of
the
subsequent
offense
and
plead
guilty
to
the
prior
offenses.
would
that
then
be
given
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
law
under
which
we're
governing
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
interrupted
you
before
you
got
to
the
change
in
the
statute,
would
you
give
us
that
now
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
those
prohibition
cases
that
you
mentioned
exactly
like
this
or
were
they
under
a
statute
which
says
a
person
who
convicts
or
who
commits
the
second
act
of
sale
after
a
conviction
of
a
prior
sale
is
guilty
of
a
higher
degree
of
crime
than
it
was
a
first
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
asked
i
didn't
suggest
that
they
were.
i'm
just
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
it
wouldn't
raise
it
from
a
misdemeanor
from
a
felony
or
a
low
misdemeanor
up
to
a
high
misdemeanor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phillips
i
would
like
to
ask
you
just
one
other
question
that
occurred
to
me.
it
may
not
be
relevant
to
this
case
but
suppose
the
man
was
charged
with
prior
convictions
and
he
denied
them
and
he
was
convicted
and
then
later
they
found
that
they
established
that
he
had
not
committed
the
priors,
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
it's
material
to
your
case.
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
subsequent
offense,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scott,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
name
of
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scott,
we
understand
that
your
client
is
an
indigent
and
that
by
appointment
of
the
courts
below
you
will
carry
this
case
through
to
this
court
as
a
public
service
and
we
want
you
to
know
that
we
appreciate
that.
in
lawyers,
it
is
a
real
public
service
and
we
thank
you
for
having
done
it.
and
mr.
philips,
we
also
want
to
thank
you
for
the
earnest
manner
that
you
have
protected
the
rights
of
your
state.
the
next
case
is
number
68,
leon
spencer,
appellant
versus
texas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
matheny.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
matheny
your
case
was
tried
was
it
under
the
same
statute
as
the
case
we
have
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
was
just
changed
this
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
been
that
way
all
through
the
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
matheny.
mr.
douglas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
douglas
in
your
case
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
charge
of
the
prior
conviction
is
it,
is
it
just
to
increase
punishment
or
is
it
designed
to
have
some
relevancy
to
guilt
in
the
instant
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
as
i
understand
it
is
not
designed
to
have
any
influence
on
the
jury
in
determining
whether
he's
guilty
or
innocent
in
the
past.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
i
understood
counsel
a
short
while
ago
to
say
that
this
whole
trial
was
permeated
with
the
introduction
of
malice
concerning
that
prior
conviction
when
he
had
already
admitted
it
ready
to
concede
it
in
court.
now
if
that
is
true
why
was
the
trial
permeated
with
that
--
that
kind
of
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
still
come
back
to
this
question,
is
the
jury
entitled
to
go
into
the
issues
of
the
first
trial
if
the
defendant
admits
that
he
was
convicted
of
that
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
this
was
a
capital
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
but
then
again
i
ask
why
this
was
a
matter
of
this
time
permeating
the
whole
trial,
why
was
it
--
why
did
the
prosecution
bear
down
on
it?
why
isn't
the
admission
that
he
was
the
person
sufficient
to
accomplish
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
concerning
the
facts
of
the
first
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
nothing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
69,
robert
a.
bell,
jr.
petitioner
versus
texas.
mr.
scott.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
present
statute
what
happens
if
he
admits
the
priors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
the
new
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
say
what
is
the
new
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
man
is
arraigned
he
said,
“i
lead
not
guilty
but
i
admit
my
priors.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
it
is
at
way
another
–
in
some
other
states
where
he
admits
the
priors
and
they
cannot
be
used
on

of
the
new

chief
justice

warren
but
if
he
denies
them
they
can
be.
now,

chief
