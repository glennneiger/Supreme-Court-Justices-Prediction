mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
thank
mr.
chief
justice
to
a
great
extent
on
my
argument
has
been
outlined
by
the
questions
of
the
respective
justices.
and
if
you
would
consider
to
proofread,
i
would
like
you
to
turn
in
read
my
argument
around
the
questions
that
have
been
asked.
with
this
distinction,
however,
if
the
court,
pleases,
i
am
dealing
with
a
rather
distinct
statute
in
my
piece
–
article
63
of
the
texas
penal
code.
i
am
not
dealing
as
we,
and
you
are
aware,
in
article
62,
the
first
case
in
the
docket
of
bell
case.
in
article
62,
we
are
dealing
with
similar
offenses.
in
article
63,
the
offense
statute
that
i
am
here
concerned
with
is
mr.
reed,
the
petitioner.
it
is
a
material
whether
the
prior
offenses
or
convictions
are
similar
or
dissimilar
so
long
as
they
are
felonies.
i
would
like
to
make
that
distinction
from
the
very
beginning.
turning
to
the
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
stipulation,
it
has
been
concerning
me,
mr.
justice,
because
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
no
answer
to
mr.
reed
to
say
if
you
were
tried
some
several
years
later
you
could
have
stipulated
at
that
time
because
the
first
time
it
was
authorized
in
the
state
of
texas
–
it
was
in
the
case
of
pitcock
vs.
state
in
1963
–
it
comes
too
late
from
mr.
reed.
and,
i'm
too
quite
concerned,
and
as
i
cited
in
my
brief
of
whether
or
not
this
goes
in
the
charge
regardless
to
the
jury.
i
can
always
say
we
have
no
cases
at
this
time
in
texas
defining
that
proposition.
i
do
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
judges
put
it
in
their
charge
some
judges
do
not
because
we
have
not
crystallized
by
an
opinion
of
our
highest
court
but
stipulation
or
no.
what
concerns
me,
there's
something
seemingly
improper
when
i
say
that
i
must
purchase
using
my
6th
amendment
right
with
my
5th
amendment
right
by
stipulating
that
i
am
going
to
help
the
prosecution
complete
an
elements
of
its
case.
this
seems
to
be
against
at
least
my
conception
of
traditional
concepts
of
ordered
liberty.
but
at
least
i
have
my
conceptions.
let
us
assumed
that
there
may
be
overriding
circumstances
of
necessity
in
this
balancing
of
the
rights
of
society
as
opposed
by
the
defendants
in
some
instance.
let
us
assume
that
there
is
an
overriding
necessity.
it's
the
word
“necessity”
that
bothers
me.
is
there
a
necessity
for
this
trial-noted
academy,
not
a
separate
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
but
is
there
a
necessity
of
one
trial
in
which
all
is
uneasy
to
get?
now,
i
listened
very
closely
yesterday
for
someone
to
give
me
answer
on
that
word,
“necessity”.
i
heard
nothing.
i
heard
no
answer.
and
yet
i,
as
a
form
of
prosecutor,
and
every
prosecutor
in
this
room
knows
the
reason
for
this
“pc
63”
as
we
call
it,
colloquially
described
as
the
“big
bitch”
in
texas.
this
is
what
we
know
it
is.
and
it
is
the
horror.
it
is
the
type
of
statute,
the
type
of
proceedings
by
which
you
cannot
only
win
a
case
on
an
easy
current
or
on
a
difficult
case
rather
as
to
the
current
offense
but
you
can
also
achieve,
i
believe,
a
high
degree
of
pleas
of
guilty
to
weak
cases
or
cases
that
you
can't
possibly
try.
we,
prosecutors
and
we,
form
of
prosecutors,
know
the
viciousness
of
this
process
and
i
can
hear
to
agree
to
no
one
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
i
think
this
is
enunciated
mr.
justice
stewart
at
page
58
and
i
did
not
cite
this
in
my
brief.
page
58
note
3
of
this
new
american
bar
series
entitled,
“conviction,
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
without
trial”.
and
in
the
broader
form
on
extensive
note,
they
described
the
procedure
that
i
have
colloquially
described
here
this
morning
of
obtaining
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
am
right.
suggesting,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
believe
in
the
west
virginia
case,
your
honor,
i
think,
as
i
recall,
the
trial
judges
is
a
part
of
the
agreement.
i
do
not
suggest
that.
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
a
customary
thing.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
am
concerned
here
with
mr.
justice
black's
concern
and
i
think
that
was
reflected,
mr.
justice
black,
in
your
dissent
in
the
jackson
vs.
dino.
i
believe
the
question
that
you
have
been
asking
here
is
the
constitutional
power
of
this
court
to
change
state
procedure.
and,
of
course,
i'm
aware
of
your
dissent
and
it
appears
that
at
least
on
our
minds,
we
might
be
in
conflict.
but
i
am
--
i
can
make
nothing
more
than
a
frontal
attack.
i've
used
the
word
“procedure”
not
as
a
matter
of
a
magical
word.
it's
difficult,
i
think,
to
avoid
this
matter
of
semantics.
but
i
fear
that
at
times
we
suffer
from
material
labors.
and,
as
i
see
in
the
reed
case,
if
i
turn
back
the
labors,
whether
it
would
be
procedure
or
substance,
i
see
a
pitiful
accused,
who
may
be
wearing
a
white
shirt
of
presumptive
innocence
but
he's
rather
hotly
battled
in
a
crooked
prejudice
denominating
from
the
end
of
the
courtroom.
with
this
be,
what
do
we
mean
when
we
say
a
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
i
think
in
the
past,
this
court
has
managed
to
cut
through
the
point,
whether
it
be
substance
or
whether
it
be
procedure
to
reach
the
thing
that
bears
down
upon
a
citizen's
rights.
but
of
course,
i
say
here
the
substance
is
prejudiced
and
there's
some
question
and
there's
a
reason
here.
of
course,
this
prejudice
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
it,
there
is
prejudice
and
i
would
agree.
everytime
i
walk
into
the
courtroom
with
my
client
under
the
indictment
and
he
is
convicted,
he
is
prejudiced.
and
this
is
as
it
should
be.
it
is
as
it
should
be
if
he
is
tried
by
an
impartial
jury.
this
is
the
prejudice
that
i'm
and
concerned
about.
this
is
a
right
that's
guaranteed
to
him,
of
course,
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth.
this
is
the
inherent
prejudice
of
being
tried
by
a
partial
jury.
and
this
is
not
a
technical
concept;
it's
something
that's
deeply
imbedded
in
our
fundamental
ideas,
a
fairness
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
anything
less,
is
a
travesty
on
justice.
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
prejudice
that
the
court
was
dealing
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
owen
vs.
dowd,
where
it
appears
to
me
that
one
of
the
most
telling
circumstances
in
erwin
was
the
express
opinion
that
other
murderers,
other
crimes
had
been
attributed
to
the
defendant.
may
be
will
here
in
reed,
as
in
erwin,
as
in
marshall
that
there
actually
is
no
prejudice
that
exists.
but
when
we
speak
of
constitutional
rights,
in
our
system
of
law
we
speak
of
this
system
of
guarantees,
of
safeguards
designed
to
do
what?
to
prevent
the
probability
of
prejudice,
of
unfairness.
i
heard
my
premise
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
and
the
sixth
amendment
as
read
to
the
due
process
clause
i
am
hoping,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
the
right
to
impartial
jury.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
will
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
there
was
probably
a
mistake
made
prior
to
matt
vs.
ohio
when
you
introduce
illegally
obtained
evidence.
in
a
sense,
we
changed
the
rule
of
procedure
with
matt
vs.
ohio
and
cur
vs.
california.
in
a
very
clear
sense,
we
change
procedure
in
jackson
vs.
denno
as
to
how
a
confession
would
be
received
in
evidence.
of
course,
i
appreciate,
mr.
justice
black,
that
was
all
of
your
dissent
but
it
appears
to
me
that
there
are
times
when
procedure
will
be
so
emerge
under
the
substance
of
the
thing
that
we
are
talking
about.
and,
we
must
recognize
that
this
court
does
have
the
power
to
change.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
we
have,
i
believe,
about
a
183.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
254;
i
lost
count,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
your
honor,
they
vary
in
size,
area
wise
and
population
wise;
large
counties,
small
counties.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
probably
not,
your
honor,
certainly
in
these
smaller
communities.
but
what
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
of
course,
they
would
be
disqualified
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
if
they
would
show
prejudice
and
that'
exactly
what
i
think
your
leading
up
to
you
that
i
haven't
shown
actual
prejudice.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
i
must
come
to
this
tribunal,
your
honor,
that's
why
i'm
here.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
time
when
the
jurors
knew
all
the
facts,
and
the
defendant
and
the
witnesses
were
even
incompetent
to
testify,
i
can
hardly
equate
that
with
the
sense
of
fairness
that
we
have
since
read
in
the/our
constitution.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
and
probably
what
they
did
in
that
county.
we
would
make
every
effort
to
assure
to
the
best
of
our
ability
of
a
probability
of
facts.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
perhaps
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
harm.
there
would
be
no
prejudice.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
but
shall
we
sacrifice
the
man
where
there
would
be
a
prejudice.
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i'm,
of
course,
thinking
about
or
on
a
motion,
your
honor,
to
file
a
change
of
venue
if
there
is
actual
prejudice
there.
there's
so
much
knowledge
about
the
prior
record
of
this
man.
this
is
the
weapon
that
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
was
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
next.
here,
we
received
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
that's
true
in
all
these
cases.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
your
quite
correct.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
that
is
the
method
of
proof
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that,
i
think,
fairly
equitable
to
describe
the
procedure
that
used
in
proving
up
these
cases.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
as
to
this
particular
type
of
evidence,
they
would
surely
be
effected
and
effected
more
strongly.
they
are
presented
a
historical
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
they
will
be
affected,
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
in
either
way.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is,
there
are
presented
here
in
these
cases
a
historical
fact
judicially
approves
a
judgment,
a
record
of
conviction.
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
put
it
from
your
minds.
i
think
i
would
be
in
better
shape
if
the
judge
didn't
even
read
the
instruction
to
ignore
what
you
have
just
heard.
you
have
just
heard
to
the
courts
of
texas
a
record
of
conviction.
i
heard
the
voice
yesterday
of
my
friend,
harvey
leon
douglas,
a
man
of
the
extreme
and
electoral
integrity
and
he
candidly
admitted
this
before
the
court
as
i
know
it
would
that
the
procedure
we
used
is
under
attack,
the
jury
probably
considers
prior
convictions
in
their
determination
of
guilty
or
innocence.
and
to
me,
this
leads
us
to
a
concise
answer
as
to
why
this
is
a
denial
of
due
process
because
we
end
up
with
a
judgment
that
is
unreliable.
you
cannot
say
that
this
jury
actually
considered
the
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
pertainrd
to
this
offense.
i
think
that's
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
jackson
vs.
denno,
erwin
vs.
dowd,
gideon
vs.
wainwright
and
we're
brought
to
this
critical
question
of
course
in
my
case.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
were
concerned
with
the
effective
counsel
in
gideon
vs.
wainwright
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
believe
that's
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
court.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
but
in
this
case,
had
mr.
reed--
had
the
most
effective
counsel
in
the
world
that
would
have
made
no
difference.
the
on
slot
of
what,
two
prior
felonies?
that's
all
they
require
to
alleged
proof
you
see
under
article
63.
that's
all;
just
two.
but
what
did
they
allege?
eight
prior
convictions
prior
the
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
oh,
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
evidence.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
remember
i
started
in
looking
for
an
answer
to
that
word
“necessity”
in
my
argument.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
find
it
in
the
exceptions
to
the
normal
rule
against
the
admission
of
extraneous
offenses
that
you
referred
to,
system,
design.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
in
the
general
proposition,
extraneous
offenses
are
inadmissible
under
certain
conditions.
the
general
rule
is
inadmissibility
except,
these
systems,
design.
the
defendant,
of
course,
can
open
up
his
character.
other
than
that,
its'
not
even
–
it's
not
even
admissible
to
attack
character
unless
he
applies
in
texas
for
a
probated
sentence
where
in
effect,
the
legis
good
care
to
many
open
to
that
in
some
way.
but
the
point,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
there
is
a
reasonable
necessity
shown
for
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
otherwise
with
guilt
or
innocence
in
this
case.
let
me
demonstrate.
suppose
10
years
ago,
i
wrote
two
hot
checks
in
texas
over
$50.
this
would
be
a
felony
in
texas;
i
was
convicted.
now
10
years
later,
i
am
on
trial
for
a
narcotics
offense;
i'm
an
addict.
is
the
writing
of
two
hot
checks
10
years
ago,
is
that
relevant
to
a
narcotics
offense
today?
i
can
see
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
pointing
out
some
relevance
for
your
dealing
with
similar
offenses.
and
i'm
not
here
to
argue
these
other
cases.
i'm
just
here
to
argue
reed.
i'm
dealing
with
article
63;
defenses
may
not
be
similar.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
reeds
case,
there
was
some
what
dissent.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
basically
that
is
the
essence.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
emerged
in
our
whole
claim
because
the
reason
why
this
otherwise
inadmissible
evidence
comes
in
is
only
because
of
that
word,
a
“necessity”
and
overriding
of
what
we
know
would
normally
be
highly
prejudicial
to
the
man
on
trial.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
--
otherwise
the
defendant
could
open
the
door
himself
by
getting
upon
the
stand
because
–
and
he
could,
i
think
in
most
states
be
impeached
with
his
prior
convictions.
frankly,
i
doubt
the
validity
of
the
notion
that
this
really
goes
to
his
verity
and
credibility/veracity.
but
nevertheless,
that's
the
theory
under
(inaudible).
otherwise,
that
would
be
grounds
for
reversible
error,
normally
in
the
state
of
texas
and
i
think
most
states.
i
cannot
--
perhaps
i
am
not
expressing
my
self
clearly.
it
appears
to
me
that
when
we
have
a
man
on
trial
for
his
life,
that
the
whole
essence
of
our
system
is
to
do
that,
which
will
give
some
assurance.
and
it
would
be
more
likelihood
of
the
fair
trial.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
it
would
be
very
serious
to
me
if
it
were
30
days.
and
i
think
that's
true
with
most
of
it.
but
in
this
procedure
which
i
think
quite
frankly,
was
designed
to
do
the
very
thing
–
it
is
probably
done
–
and
that
is
to
prejudice
with
defendant
and
to
make
a
good
case
out
of
a
weak
current
offense.
now,
if
we
are
dealing
with
unreliable
judgment,
if
you
agree
with
me
there
then
i
think
retroactivity
must
necessarily
follow
under
the
opinions
of
this
court.
i
think
it
must
necessarily
follow
because
if
we
have
unreliable
judgments
of
conviction,
then
we
strike
at
the
very
foundation
of
our
whole
system
which
is
some
degree
of
assurance,
of
a
reliable
judgment;
the
whole
thing
trembles.
i
think
we're
always
faced
with
this
favorite
dragon.
if
you
hold
retroactive,
does
it
open
the
gates
of
the
penitentiary?
let's
compare
the
gates
that
were
opened
to
the
gideon
defendants
and
the
gates
that
may
be
opened
to
what
i
might
call
the
reed
defendant.
in
the
first
place,
i
doubt
that
we
have
as
many
reed
defendants.
we
may.
i
know
i
find
a
literal
terse
statistics
on
the
subject.
the
texas
penitentiary
reports
as
of
the
end
of
the
year
some
500
inmates
serving
a
life
sentence;
these
are
habituals
among
some
12,800
prisoners.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
allow
that
--
i
just
showed
that
i
attempted
to
get
some
figures
and
i'm
very
proud
of
it.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
oh
that
means
and
it
is
the
letter
attached
to
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
on
that
particular
day
at
that
penitentiary
there
were
500
defendants/prisoners
serving
under
article
63
as
habituals.
they
may
have
or
some
of
them
may
have
come
in
the
day
before
or
some
of
them
may
have
been
about
to
be
brought
on
the
next
day,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
life
sentences.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
out
of
12,800
prisoners.
at
the
time
i
contact
the
penitentiary,
they
didn't
even
have
these
statistics.
they
had
to
put
it
to
a
computer
to
answer
my
letter.
i
have
attempted
to
find
statistics
from
else
where
in
the
country
and
i
find,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
difficulty
and
even
obtaining
a
good
law
reviews
on
the
whole
general
settings.
i
think
i've
cited
in
my
brief
this
canadian
on
our
review
which
is
possibly
one
of
the
best.
but
there's
another
fact
wherein
to
comparing
this
with
the
gideon
defendant.
there's
a
rather
strong
deterrent
you
know
in
texas
and
i
think
possibly
another
states
in
a
man
filing
his
petition.
if
you
agree
that
this
is
unconstitutional,
he
can
be
retried.
the
retrial
of
his
case,
as
i
argue
it,
is
not
anymore
difficult
than
it
is
with
the
gideon
defendant.
what
is
the
element,
the
dismissing,
which
is
not
missing
with
the
gideon
defendant?
the
elements
are
the
prior
convictions.
this
is
a
historical
documented
fact
and
no
problem
in
the
retrial.
and
in
the
retrial,
under
the
law
of
texas,
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
credit
for
his
back
time
served.
now,
this,
of
course,
should
be
quite
a
deterrence
or
a
prisoner/inmate
under
the
situation
that
reed
is
in
filing
his
numerous
petitions.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
raised
it
on
the
theory
of
favors
vs.
noreen,
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
me
and
the
state
has
not
contested
that
from
that
point
on.
on
the
ground
that
i
have
no
effective
remedy,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
both
before
reed
“we
do
not
have
even
the
power
to
decide
this”
and
after
reed,
“we
do
not
have
the
power
to
decide
it”
and
the
fifth
circuit
speaking
through
judge
brown
stated
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
precious
time
and
judicial
energy
to
present
it
to
this
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas.
this
is
not
a
judicial
slap
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals;
they
just
recognized
facts.
i
would
say
this,
mr.
reed
possibly
made
the
best
argument.
he
ran
from
this
trial
before
it
was
over.
he
escaped.
he
recognized
the
prejudice.
he
recognized
his
position.
after
all
the
reading
of
eight
counts
prior
convictions
that
were
unnecessary
were
prove
only
two.
that
was
all
they
needed
to
prove.
a
representative,
if
i'm
in
with
this
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
negro
in
arkansas
wanted
to
escape
one
time
and
he
articulated
the
matter
rather
succinctly.
when
i
asked
him
why
he
ran
and
he
said,
“mr.
lawyer,
i
know
of
only
two
forms
of
justice
here
and
those
are
my
two
feet”.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
remarks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
i
don’t
think
we
disagree
with
too
much
about
what
he
said
and
that
this
has
been
rehabilitation,
we’re
all
for
that
and
the
civil
statute,
we’re
all
for
that.
the
thing
that
i’m
disturbed
about,
as
i
said
initially,
is
that
we
may
have
an
unreliable
judgment.
we
may
have
an
innocent
man
who
in
fact
was
not
guilty
of
the
current
offense.
that
is
what
disturbs
me
and
that
is
what
the
disturbing
factor
in
this
case.
now,
he
says
they
are
all
will
going
to
turn
lose.
of
course,
that’s
not
true.
they
can
be
retried
just
as
the
gideon
defendants
were,
we
tried.
now
they
have
got
an
(inaudible)
burden
here.
if
they
lose,
they
are
not
entitled
under
the
texas
law
any
of
their
back
town.
i
do
not
visualize
the
favorite
has
anything
more
than
a
favorite
dragon.
we’ve
been
very
gracious.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
thank
mr.
chief
justice
to
a
great
extent
on
my
argument
has
been
outlined
by
the
questions
of
the
respective
justices.
and
if
you
would
consider
to
proofread,
i
would
like
you
to
turn
in
read
my
argument
around
the
questions
that
have
been
asked.
with
this
distinction,
however,
if
the
court,
pleases,
i
am
dealing
with
a
rather
distinct
statute
in
my
piece
–
article
63
of
the
texas
penal
code.
i
am
not
dealing
as
we,
and
you
are
aware,
in
article
62,
the
first
case
in
the
docket
of
bell
case.
in
article
62,
we
are
dealing
with
similar
offenses.
in
article
63,
the
offense
statute
that
i
am
here
concerned
with
is
mr.
reed,
the
petitioner.
it
is
a
material
whether
the
prior
offenses
or
convictions
are
similar
or
dissimilar
so
long
as
they
are
felonies.
i
would
like
to
make
that
distinction
from
the
very
beginning.
turning
to
the
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
stipulation,
it
has
been
concerning
me,
mr.
justice,
because
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
no
answer
to
mr.
reed
to
say
if
you
were
tried
some
several
years
later
you
could
have
stipulated
at
that
time
because
the
first
time
it
was
authorized
in
the
state
of
texas
–
it
was
in
the
case
of
pitcock
vs.
state
in
1963
–
it
comes
too
late
from
mr.
reed.
and,
i'm
too
quite
concerned,
and
as
i
cited
in
my
brief
of
whether
or
not
this
goes
in
the
charge
regardless
to
the
jury.
i
can
always
say
we
have
no
cases
at
this
time
in
texas
defining
that
proposition.
i
do
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
judges
put
it
in
their
charge
some
judges
do
not
because
we
have
not
crystallized
by
an
opinion
of
our
highest
court
but
stipulation
or
no.
what
concerns
me,
there's
something
seemingly
improper
when
i
say
that
i
must
purchase
using
my
6th
amendment
right
with
my
5th
amendment
right
by
stipulating
that
i
am
going
to
help
the
prosecution
complete
an
elements
of
its
case.
this
seems
to
be
against
at
least
my
conception
of
traditional
concepts
of
ordered
liberty.
but
at
least
i
have
my
conceptions.
let
us
assumed
that
there
may
be
overriding
circumstances
of
necessity
in
this
balancing
of
the
rights
of
society
as
opposed
by
the
defendants
in
some
instance.
let
us
assume
that
there
is
an
overriding
necessity.
it's
the
word
“necessity”
that
bothers
me.
is
there
a
necessity
for
this
trial-noted
academy,
not
a
separate
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
but
is
there
a
necessity
of
one
trial
in
which
all
is
uneasy
to
get?
now,
i
listened
very
closely
yesterday
for
someone
to
give
me
answer
on
that
word,
“necessity”.
i
heard
nothing.
i
heard
no
answer.
and
yet
i,
as
a
form
of
prosecutor,
and
every
prosecutor
in
this
room
knows
the
reason
for
this
“pc
63”
as
we
call
it,
colloquially
described
as
the
“big
bitch”
in
texas.
this
is
what
we
know
it
is.
and
it
is
the
horror.
it
is
the
type
of
statute,
the
type
of
proceedings
by
which
you
cannot
only
win
a
case
on
an
easy
current
or
on
a
difficult
case
rather
as
to
the
current
offense
but
you
can
also
achieve,
i
believe,
a
high
degree
of
pleas
of
guilty
to
weak
cases
or
cases
that
you
can't
possibly
try.
we,
prosecutors
and
we,
form
of
prosecutors,
know
the
viciousness
of
this
process
and
i
can
hear
to
agree
to
no
one
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
i
think
this
is
enunciated
mr.
justice
stewart
at
page
58
and
i
did
not
cite
this
in
my
brief.
page
58
note
3
of
this
new
american
bar
series
entitled,
“conviction,
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
without
trial”.
and
in
the
broader
form
on
extensive
note,
they
described
the
procedure
that
i
have
colloquially
described
here
this
morning
of
obtaining
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
am
right.
suggesting,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
believe
in
the
west
virginia
case,
your
honor,
i
think,
as
i
recall,
the
trial
judges
is
a
part
of
the
agreement.
i
do
not
suggest
that.
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
a
customary
thing.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
am
concerned
here
with
mr.
justice
black's
concern
and
i
think
that
was
reflected,
mr.
justice
black,
in
your
dissent
in
the
jackson
vs.
dino.
i
believe
the
question
that
you
have
been
asking
here
is
the
constitutional
power
of
this
court
to
change
state
procedure.
and,
of
course,
i'm
aware
of
your
dissent
and
it
appears
that
at
least
on
our
minds,
we
might
be
in
conflict.
but
i
am
--
i
can
make
nothing
more
than
a
frontal
attack.
i've
used
the
word
“procedure”
not
as
a
matter
of
a
magical
word.
it's
difficult,
i
think,
to
avoid
this
matter
of
semantics.
but
i
fear
that
at
times
we
suffer
from
material
labors.
and,
as
i
see
in
the
reed
case,
if
i
turn
back
the
labors,
whether
it
would
be
procedure
or
substance,
i
see
a
pitiful
accused,
who
may
be
wearing
a
white
shirt
of
presumptive
innocence
but
he's
rather
hotly
battled
in
a
crooked
prejudice
denominating
from
the
end
of
the
courtroom.
with
this
be,
what
do
we
mean
when
we
say
a
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
i
think
in
the
past,
this
court
has
managed
to
cut
through
the
point,
whether
it
be
substance
or
whether
it
be
procedure
to
reach
the
thing
that
bears
down
upon
a
citizen's
rights.
but
of
course,
i
say
here
the
substance
is
prejudiced
and
there's
some
question
and
there's
a
reason
here.
of
course,
this
prejudice
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
it,
there
is
prejudice
and
i
would
agree.
everytime
i
walk
into
the
courtroom
with
my
client
under
the
indictment
and
he
is
convicted,
he
is
prejudiced.
and
this
is
as
it
should
be.
it
is
as
it
should
be
if
he
is
tried
by
an
impartial
jury.
this
is
the
prejudice
that
i'm
and
concerned
about.
this
is
a
right
that's
guaranteed
to
him,
of
course,
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth.
this
is
the
inherent
prejudice
of
being
tried
by
a
partial
jury.
and
this
is
not
a
technical
concept;
it's
something
that's
deeply
imbedded
in
our
fundamental
ideas,
a
fairness
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
anything
less,
is
a
travesty
on
justice.
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
prejudice
that
the
court
was
dealing
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
owen
vs.
dowd,
where
it
appears
to
me
that
one
of
the
most
telling
circumstances
in
erwin
was
the
express
opinion
that
other
murderers,
other
crimes
had
been
attributed
to
the
defendant.
may
be
will
here
in
reed,
as
in
erwin,
as
in
marshall
that
there
actually
is
no
prejudice
that
exists.
but
when
we
speak
of
constitutional
rights,
in
our
system
of
law
we
speak
of
this
system
of
guarantees,
of
safeguards
designed
to
do
what?
to
prevent
the
probability
of
prejudice,
of
unfairness.
i
heard
my
premise
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
and
the
sixth
amendment
as
read
to
the
due
process
clause
i
am
hoping,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
the
right
to
impartial
jury.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
will
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
there
was
probably
a
mistake
made
prior
to
matt
vs.
ohio
when
you
introduce
illegally
obtained
evidence.
in
a
sense,
we
changed
the
rule
of
procedure
with
matt
vs.
ohio
and
cur
vs.
california.
in
a
very
clear
sense,
we
change
procedure
in
jackson
vs.
denno
as
to
how
a
confession
would
be
received
in
evidence.
of
course,
i
appreciate,
mr.
justice
black,
that
was
all
of
your
dissent
but
it
appears
to
me
that
there
are
times
when
procedure
will
be
so
emerge
under
the
substance
of
the
thing
that
we
are
talking
about.
and,
we
must
recognize
that
this
court
does
have
the
power
to
change.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
we
have,
i
believe,
about
a
183.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
254;
i
lost
count,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
your
honor,
they
vary
in
size,
area
wise
and
population
wise;
large
counties,
small
counties.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
probably
not,
your
honor,
certainly
in
these
smaller
communities.
but
what
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
of
course,
they
would
be
disqualified
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
if
they
would
show
prejudice
and
that'
exactly
what
i
think
your
leading
up
to
you
that
i
haven't
shown
actual
prejudice.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
i
must
come
to
this
tribunal,
your
honor,
that's
why
i'm
here.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
time
when
the
jurors
knew
all
the
facts,
and
the
defendant
and
the
witnesses
were
even
incompetent
to
testify,
i
can
hardly
equate
that
with
the
sense
of
fairness
that
we
have
since
read
in
the/our
constitution.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
and
probably
what
they
did
in
that
county.
we
would
make
every
effort
to
assure
to
the
best
of
our
ability
of
a
probability
of
facts.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
perhaps
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
harm.
there
would
be
no
prejudice.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
but
shall
we
sacrifice
the
man
where
there
would
be
a
prejudice.
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i'm,
of
course,
thinking
about
or
on
a
motion,
your
honor,
to
file
a
change
of
venue
if
there
is
actual
prejudice
there.
there's
so
much
knowledge
about
the
prior
record
of
this
man.
this
is
the
weapon
that
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
was
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
next.
here,
we
received
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
that's
true
in
all
these
cases.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
your
quite
correct.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
that
is
the
method
of
proof
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that,
i
think,
fairly
equitable
to
describe
the
procedure
that
used
in
proving
up
these
cases.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
as
to
this
particular
type
of
evidence,
they
would
surely
be
effected
and
effected
more
strongly.
they
are
presented
a
historical
–
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
they
will
be
affected,
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
in
either
way.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is,
there
are
presented
here
in
these
cases
a
historical
fact
judicially
approves
a
judgment,
a
record
of
conviction.
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
put
it
from
your
minds.
i
think
i
would
be
in
better
shape
if
the
judge
didn't
even
read
the
instruction
to
ignore
what
you
have
just
heard.
you
have
just
heard
to
the
courts
of
texas
a
record
of
conviction.
i
heard
the
voice
yesterday
of
my
friend,
harvey
leon
douglas,
a
man
of
the
extreme
and
electoral
integrity
and
he
candidly
admitted
this
before
the
court
as
i
know
it
would
that
the
procedure
we
used
is
under
attack,
the
jury
probably
considers
prior
convictions
in
their
determination
of
guilty
or
innocence.
and
to
me,
this
leads
us
to
a
concise
answer
as
to
why
this
is
a
denial
of
due
process
because
we
end
up
with
a
judgment
that
is
unreliable.
you
cannot
say
that
this
jury
actually
considered
the
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
pertainrd
to
this
offense.
i
think
that's
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
jackson
vs.
denno,
erwin
vs.
dowd,
gideon
vs.
wainwright
and
we're
brought
to
this
critical
question
of
course
in
my
case.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
were
concerned
with
the
effective
counsel
in
gideon
vs.
wainwright
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
believe
that's
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
court.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
but
in
this
case,
had
mr.
reed--
had
the
most
effective
counsel
in
the
world
that
would
have
made
no
difference.
the
on
slot
of
what,
two
prior
felonies?
that's
all
they
require
to
alleged
proof
you
see
under
article
63.
that's
all;
just
two.
but
what
did
they
allege?
eight
prior
convictions
prior
the
--
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
oh,
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
evidence.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
remember
i
started
in
looking
for
an
answer
to
that
word
“necessity”
in
my
argument.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
find
it
in
the
exceptions
to
the
normal
rule
against
the
admission
of
extraneous
offenses
that
you
referred
to,
system,
design.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
in
the
general
proposition,
extraneous
offenses
are
inadmissible
under
certain
conditions.
the
general
rule
is
inadmissibility
except,
these
systems,
design.
the
defendant,
of
course,
can
open
up
his
character.
other
than
that,
its'
not
even
–
it's
not
even
admissible
to
attack
character
unless
he
applies
in
texas
for
a
probated
sentence
where
in
effect,
the
legis
good
care
to
many
open
to
that
in
some
way.
but
the
point,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
there
is
a
reasonable
necessity
shown
for
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
otherwise
with
guilt
or
innocence
in
this
case.
let
me
demonstrate.
suppose
10
years
ago,
i
wrote
two
hot
checks
in
texas
over
$50.
this
would
be
a
felony
in
texas;
i
was
convicted.
now
10
years
later,
i
am
on
trial
for
a
narcotics
offense;
i'm
an
addict.
is
the
writing
of
two
hot
checks
10
years
ago,
is
that
relevant
to
a
narcotics
offense
today?
i
can
see
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
pointing
out
some
relevance
for
your
dealing
with
similar
offenses.
and
i'm
not
here
to
argue
these
other
cases.
i'm
just
here
to
argue
reed.
i'm
dealing
with
article
63;
defenses
may
not
be
similar.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
reeds
case,
there
was
some
what
dissent.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
basically
that
is
the
essence.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
i
think
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
emerged
in
our
whole
claim
because
the
reason
why
this
otherwise
inadmissible
evidence
comes
in
is
only
because
of
that
word,
a
“necessity”
and
overriding
of
what
we
know
would
normally
be
highly
prejudicial
to
the
man
on
trial.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
--
otherwise
the
defendant
could
open
the
door
himself
by
getting
upon
the
stand
because
–
and
he
could,
i
think
in
most
states
be
impeached
with
his
prior
convictions.
frankly,
i
doubt
the
validity
of
the
notion
that
this
really
goes
to
his
verity
and
credibility/veracity.
but
nevertheless,
that's
the
theory
under
(inaudible).
otherwise,
that
would
be
grounds
for
reversible
error,
normally
in
the
state
of
texas
and
i
think
most
states.
i
cannot
--
perhaps
i
am
not
expressing
my
self
clearly.
it
appears
to
me
that
when
we
have
a
man
on
trial
for
his
life,
that
the
whole
essence
of
our
system
is
to
do
that,
which
will
give
some
assurance.
and
it
would
be
more
likelihood
of
the
fair
trial.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
it
would
be
very
serious
to
me
if
it
were
30
days.
and
i
think
that's
true
with
most
of
it.
but
in
this
procedure
which
i
think
quite
frankly,
was
designed
to
do
the
very
thing
–
it
is
probably
done
–
and
that
is
to
prejudice
with
defendant
and
to
make
a
good
case
out
of
a
weak
current
offense.
now,
if
we
are
dealing
with
unreliable
judgment,
if
you
agree
with
me
there
then
i
think
retroactivity
must
necessarily
follow
under
the
opinions
of
this
court.
i
think
it
must
necessarily
follow
because
if
we
have
unreliable
judgments
of
conviction,
then
we
strike
at
the
very
foundation
of
our
whole
system
which
is
some
degree
of
assurance,
of
a
reliable
judgment;
the
whole
thing
trembles.
i
think
we're
always
faced
with
this
favorite
dragon.
if
you
hold
retroactive,
does
it
open
the
gates
of
the
penitentiary?
let's
compare
the
gates
that
were
opened
to
the
gideon
defendants
and
the
gates
that
may
be
opened
to
what
i
might
call
the
reed
defendant.
in
the
first
place,
i
doubt
that
we
have
as
many
reed
defendants.
we
may.
i
know
i
find
a
literal
terse
statistics
on
the
subject.
the
texas
penitentiary
reports
as
of
the
end
of
the
year
some
500
inmates
serving
a
life
sentence;
these
are
habituals
among
some
12,800
prisoners.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
allow
that
--
i
just
showed
that
i
attempted
to
get
some
figures
and
i'm
very
proud
of
it.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
oh
that
means
and
it
is
the
letter
attached
to
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
on
that
particular
day
at
that
penitentiary
there
were
500
defendants/prisoners
serving
under
article
63
as
habituals.
they
may
have
or
some
of
them
may
have
come
in
the
day
before
or
some
of
them
may
have
been
about
to
be
brought
on
the
next
day,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
life
sentences.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
out
of
12,800
prisoners.
at
the
time
i
contact
the
penitentiary,
they
didn't
even
have
these
statistics.
they
had
to
put
it
to
a
computer
to
answer
my
letter.
i
have
attempted
to
find
statistics
from
else
where
in
the
country
and
i
find,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
difficulty
and
even
obtaining
a
good
law
reviews
on
the
whole
general
settings.
i
think
i've
cited
in
my
brief
this
canadian
on
our
review
which
is
possibly
one
of
the
best.
but
there's
another
fact
wherein
to
comparing
this
with
the
gideon
defendant.
there's
a
rather
strong
deterrent
you
know
in
texas
and
i
think
possibly
another
states
in
a
man
filing
his
petition.
if
you
agree
that
this
is
unconstitutional,
he
can
be
retried.
the
retrial
of
his
case,
as
i
argue
it,
is
not
anymore
difficult
than
it
is
with
the
gideon
defendant.
what
is
the
element,
the
dismissing,
which
is
not
missing
with
the
gideon
defendant?
the
elements
are
the
prior
convictions.
this
is
a
historical
documented
fact
and
no
problem
in
the
retrial.
and
in
the
retrial,
under
the
law
of
texas,
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
credit
for
his
back
time
served.
now,
this,
of
course,
should
be
quite
a
deterrence
or
a
prisoner/inmate
under
the
situation
that
reed
is
in
filing
his
numerous
petitions.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
raised
it
on
the
theory
of
favors
vs.
noreen,
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
me
and
the
state
has
not
contested
that
from
that
point
on.
on
the
ground
that
i
have
no
effective
remedy,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
both
before
reed
“we
do
not
have
even
the
power
to
decide
this”
and
after
reed,
“we
do
not
have
the
power
to
decide
it”
and
the
fifth
circuit
speaking
through
judge
brown
stated
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
precious
time
and
judicial
energy
to
present
it
to
this
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas.
this
is
not
a
judicial
slap
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals;
they
just
recognized
facts.
i
would
say
this,
mr.
reed
possibly
made
the
best
argument.
he
ran
from
this
trial
before
it
was
over.
he
escaped.
he
recognized
the
prejudice.
he
recognized
his
position.
after
all
the
reading
of
eight
counts
prior
convictions
that
were
unnecessary
were
prove
only
two.
that
was
all
they
needed
to
prove.
a
representative,
if
i'm
in
with
this
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
negro
in
arkansas
wanted
to
escape
one
time
and
he
articulated
the
matter
rather
succinctly.
when
i
asked
him
why
he
ran
and
he
said,
“mr.
lawyer,
i
know
of
only
two
forms
of
justice
here
and
those
are
my
two
feet”.
mr.
emmett
colvin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
remarks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
i
don’t
think
we
disagree
with
too
much
about
what
he
said
and
that
this
has
been
rehabilitation,
we’re
all
for
that
and
the
civil
statute,
we’re
all
for
that.
the
thing
that
i’m
disturbed
about,
as
i
said
initially,
is
that
we
may
have
an
unreliable
judgment.
we
may
have
an
innocent
man
who
in
fact
was
not
guilty
of
the
current
offense.
that
is
what
disturbs
me
and
that
is
what
the
disturbing
factor
in
this
case.
now,
he
says
they
are
all
will
going
to
turn
lose.
of
course,
that’s
not
true.
they
can
be
retried
just
as
the
gideon
defendants
were,
we
tried.
now
they
have
got
an
(inaudible)
burden
here.
if
they
lose,
they
are
not
entitled
under
the
texas
law
any
of
their
back
town.
i
do
not
visualize
the
favorite
has
anything
more
than
a
favorite
dragon.
we’ve
been
very
gracious.
