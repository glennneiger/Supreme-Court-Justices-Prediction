justice
potter
stewart
and
texas
no
longer
does
this?
justice
potter
stewart
this
year.
how
many
states
do
follow
this
practice,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
far
as
you
can
tell
it's
around
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
procedure
under
all
three
of
these
is
the
same
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
up
until
the
first
of
issue
as
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
same
jury
that
determines
guilt
in
doing
so
before
it
determines
guilt.
justice
potter
stewart
the
boyd
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
just
agree
that
might
and
would
it
continue
but
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it
is
that
the
admission
of
prior
offenses
does
not
violate
due
process
clause
on
the
point
as
to
show
a
common
scheme
or
plan
and
that
it
does
and
permissibly
it's
the
same
kind
of
prejudice
in
either
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
should
think
just
that
if
it's
prejudicially
unfair
and
violative
of
due
process
to
introduce
evidence
of
prior
criminal
offenses
before
jury
that's
determining
the
guilt
of
this
offense
that
it
is
in
the
one
case
than
it
is
in
the
other.
there
might
be
a
more
of
a
reason
in
one
case,
and
a
more
illogical
reason
to
do
in
one
case
than
in
the
other
but
if
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
is
violative
of
the
due
process
i
should
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
asking
us
to
balance
the
point
of
it
with
the
prejudicial
effect
of
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
unfairly
prejudicial.
justice
potter
stewart
if
justice
white
pointed
out
every
bit
of
the
evidence
of
the
prosecution
is
supposed
to
damage
the
defendant
and
lead
to
his
conviction,
that's
the
purpose
of
introducing
it.
the
question
is
whether
it's
unfairly
or
unconstitutionally
prejudicial.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
now
using
since
the
first
this
year?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
it
went
into
the
indictment
in
any
event
and
if
the
indictment
went
into
the
jury
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
read
--
that
indictment
is
read
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
mistaken,
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
has
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
massey
against
united
states,
i
see
it.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
in
referring
now
to
the
old
procedure
the
one
that
was
in
existence
in
this
case
now
before
us,
would
it
have
been
possible
for
the
defendant
to
have
avoid
the
jury
knowing
anything
about
the
charge
against
him
of
prior
offenses.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
you're
telling
me
as
i
understand
that
the
jury
would
not
have
known
and
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
was
charged
or
that
he
had
admitted
his
identity
as
the
one
who
had
been
previously
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
had
--
if
he
had
admitted
his
identity.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we're
now
talking
about
the
old
procedure
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
read
the
michelson
opinion.
i
read
it
frequently
right
here
on
the
bench
as
well
as
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinion
and
in
my
hasty
reading
i
didn't
quite
find
a
single
reference
to
the
united
states
constitution,
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
just
the
--
the
question
for
the
court
was
about
whether
or
not
this
court
was
going
to
promulgate
a
rule
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts.
i
don't
see
a
single
reference
to
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
why
--
why
is
that
in
1966,
the
question
no
longer
arise?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
without
--
certainly
this
much
would
have
been
admissible
in
this
particular
case
i
should
think
quite
apart
from
the
statute.
the
briefs
indicate
that
the
evidence
was
that
this
man
had
threatened
his
second
wife
and
he
said
when
they
were
arguing
in
a
room,
he
told
her
that
if
she
didn't
shut
up,
he
would
kill
her
like
he
did
his
first
wife.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
evidence
would
be
admissible
quite
apart
from
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
your
state
of
baker
against
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
six
years
before.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
his
then
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
douglas,
just
so
i
can
you
know
and
hopefully
basic
understanding
of
your
law,
if
this
had
been
a
first
offense,
and
that
is
the
first
offense
for
which
capital
punishment
can
be
imposed,
then
of
course
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
come
before
the
jury
and
what
would
the
jury's
power
would
have
-–
what
were
the
jury's
power
have
been
after
its
finding,
the
reaching
the
verdict
of
guilt,
then
what
power
would
they
have
had
with
respect
to
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
any
of
those
options
are
within
the
--
would
have
been
within
the
power
of
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
that
the
jury
apparently
has
15
years
in
the
first
case
but
then
when
the
judge
imposes
a
sentence
of
two
to
15
years.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
same
statutory
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
matheny,
as
i
understand
it,
you
at
least
inclusively
would
not
attack
a
procedure
that
allow
the
determination
of
guilt
in
this
kind
of
a
case
by
the
jury,
by
a
jury
which
was
uninformed
of
his
prior
conviction
and
then
subsequently,
a
determination
of
the
penalty
to
be
imposed
by
the
same
jury,
which
was
informed
of
his
prior
conviction.
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
that's
true,
then
what
would
be
the
words
of
chief
judge
vegas
that
you
just
read
to
us
if
--
wouldn't
they
have
equal
meaning
in
that
kind
of
situation?
because
it's
there
that
we'd
be
talking
about
the
count,
the
death
penalty
as
he
talks
about
and
that
the
jury
in
deciding
whether
or
not
will
impose
a
life
sentence
or
a
death
sentence,
which
is
i
understand
it
under
the
texas
law
is
the
only
alternative
in
the
cases
of
prior
--
second
prosecution
for
malicious
murder
or
whatever
you
call
it.
would
it
be
equally
invalid
constitutionally
to
have
a
jury
know
about
his
previous
conviction
in
determining
merely
the
question
of
what
penalty
to
impose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
must
appreciate
that
but
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't'
really
understand.
if
you
give
me
two
incidences
or
–
justice
potter
stewart
and,
therefore,
you
are
telling
us
that
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
bring
before
a
jury,
entrusted
only
with
the
decision
of
what
punishment
to
impose
any
record
of
previous
convictions
if
the
question
before
the
jury
were
whether
to
impose
a
life
sentence
or
death
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
gather
there
was
no
evidence
that
would
detail
to
the
previous.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
indictment
in
the
form
of
prosecution
was
in
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
you
telling
us?
you
were
telling
us
by
imputation
you
get
this
guilty
plea
from
the
defendant
and
return
for
your
agreement
not
to
invoke
63,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
return
to
the
prosecutor's
agreement
not
to
invoke
this
texas
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
not
use
suggesting
that
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
to
your
constitutional
rights.
as
i
understand
it,
the
part
of
the
constitution
and
the
only
part
upon
which
you
are
relying
in
this
case
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
which
part
of
the
sixth?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do,
i
would
just
want
to
be
sure
my
facts
are
right.
i
had
understood
that
there
were
instructions
in
this
case,
and
all
three
of
these
cases,
by
the
court
not
to
consider
these
previous
convictions
in
arriving
in
the
determination
of
guilt.
justice
potter
stewart
very
explicit
instructions,
is
that
correct
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
understand
your
argument
fully
but
if
i
do
then
what
you
say
i
should
think
will
also
make
constitutionally
invalid
the
introduction
in
evidence
before
a
jury
entrusted
with
the
determination
of
guilt
of
prior
convictions
in
sexual
offenses
or
in
fraud
or
in
the
various
other
familiar
evidentiary
exceptions
which
permit
the
introduction
of
evidences
of
prior
offenses
to
show
a
common
scheme
or
plan
or
to
show
propensity
and
you
know
all
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
in
textbooks.
why
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
what
you‘re
saying
now
about
this
procedure
wouldn't
be
equally
applicable
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
of
prior
convictions
in
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
how
normal
the
rule
is.
i'm
sure
there
are
variations
in
each
one
of
the
50
states.
but
we
are
familiar
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
telling
us
then?
if
it's
necessary,
the
due
process
clause
can
be
violated
but
in
this
case
it's
not
necessary.
justice
potter
stewart
i
never
understood
that
necessity
was
an
answer
to
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
isn't
highly
and
unconstitutionally
prejudicial
then
it
is.
and
if
it
isn't,
that
isn't.
and
if
it
is,
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
no
matter
what
the
claim
of
necessity
might
be,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
just
have
to
be
on
trial
for
his
life?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't,
perhaps
this
isn't
too
far
but
you
are
now
relying
on
the
statistics.
i
don't
quite
understand
that
--
those
statistics.
some
500
lifers
among
all
the
lifers
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
and
i
don't
understand
what
these
figures
are.
i
don't'
even
understand
the
figures.
are
they
that
among
all
the
people
serving
life
sentences,
500
of
them
are
recidivist
or
500
of
all
the
12,000
are
serving
life
sentences
or
what
other
figures
--
justice
potter
stewart
serving
life
sentences?
justice
potter
stewart
habitual
under
63?
justice
potter
stewart
out
of
how
many
serving
life
sentences?
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
understood,
mr.
fender
that
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
were
making
no
constitutional
tag
at
all
upon
the
laws
which
increase
the
punishment
for
multiple
offenders.
but
as
their
attack
was
limited
simply
and
exclusively
to
the
procedure
bringing
these
previous
convictions
before
a
jury
which
was
in
custody
of
determining
the
guilt
on
the
present
charge.
and
what
you
said
before
i
think
is
something
which
they
wouldn’t
disagree
it.
but
these
cases
involve
the
procedure
bringing
this
conviction
before
the
jury
entrusted
with
the
task
of
determining
the
guilt
of
the
person
charged.
justice
potter
stewart
and
texas
no
longer
does
this?
justice

arguing
in
a
room,
he
told
her
that
if
she
didn't
shut
up,
he
would
kill
her
like
he
did
his
first
wife.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
evidence
would
be
admissible
quite
apart
from
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
your
state
of
baker
against
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
six
years
before.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
his
then
wife?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
douglas,
just
so
i
can
you
know
and
hopefully
basic
understanding
of
your
law,
if
this
had
been
a
first
offense,
and
that
is
the
first
offense
for
which
capital
punishment
can
be
imposed,
then
of
course
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
come
before
the
jury
and
what
would
the
jury's
power
would
have
-–
what
were
the
jury's
power
have
been
after
its
finding,
the
reaching
the
verdict
of
guilt,
then
what
power
would
they
have
had
with
respect
to
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
any
of
those
options
are
within
the
--
would
have
been
within
the
power
of
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
that
the
jury
apparently
has
15
years
in
the
first
case
but
then
when
the
judge
imposes
a
sentence
of
two
to
15
years.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
same
statutory
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
matheny,
as
i
understand
it,
you
at
least
inclusively
would
not
attack
a
procedure
that
allow
the
determination
of
guilt
in
this
kind
of
a
case
by
the
jury,
by
a
jury
which
was
uninformed
of
his
prior
conviction
and
then
subsequently,
a
determination
of
the
penalty
to
be
imposed
by
the
same
jury,
which
was
informed
of
his
prior
conviction.
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
that's
true,
then
what
would
be
the
words
of
chief
judge
vegas
that
you
just
read
to
us
if
--
wouldn't
they
have
equal
meaning
in
that
kind
of
situation?
because
it's
there
that
we'd
be
talking
about
the
count,
the
death
penalty
as
he
talks
about
and
that
the
jury
in
deciding
whether
or
not
will
impose
a
life
sentence
or
a
death
sentence,
which
is
i
understand
it
under
the
texas
law
is
the
only
alternative
in
the
cases
of
prior
--
second
prosecution
for
malicious
murder
or
whatever
you
call
it.
would
it
be
equally
invalid
constitutionally
to
have
a
jury
know
about
his
previous
conviction
in
determining
merely
the
question
of
what
penalty
to
impose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
must
appreciate
that
but
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't'
really
understand.
if
you
give
me
two
incidences
or
–
justice
potter
stewart
and,
therefore,
you
are
telling
us
that
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
bring
before
a
jury,
entrusted
only
with
the
decision
of
what
punishment
to
impose
any
record
of
previous
convictions
if
the
question
before
the
jury
were
whether
to
impose
a
life
sentence
or
death
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
gather
there
was
no
evidence
that
would
detail
to
the
previous.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
indictment
in
the
form
of
prosecution
was
in
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
you
telling
us?
you
were
telling
us
by
imputation
you
get
this
guilty
plea
from
the
defendant
and
return
for
your
agreement
not
to
invoke
63,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
return
to
the
prosecutor's
agreement
not
to
invoke
this
texas
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
not
use
suggesting
that
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
to
your
constitutional
rights.
as
i
understand
it,
the
part
of
the
constitution
and
the
only
part
upon
which
you
are
relying
in
this
case
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
which
part
of
the
sixth?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do,
i
would
just
want
to
be
sure
my
facts
are
right.
i
had
understood
that
there
were
instructions
in
this
case,
and
all
three
of
these
cases,
by
the
court
not
to
consider
these
previous
convictions
in
arriving
in
the
determination
of
guilt.
justice
potter
stewart
very
explicit
instructions,
is
that
correct
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
understand
your
argument
fully
but
if
i
do
then
what
you
say
i
should
think
will
also
make
constitutionally
invalid
the
introduction
in
evidence
before
a
jury
entrusted
with
the
determination
of
guilt
of
prior
convictions
in
sexual
offenses
or
in
fraud
or
in
the
various
other
familiar
evidentiary
exceptions
which
permit
the
introduction
of
evidences
of
prior
offenses
to
show
a
common
scheme
or
plan
or
to
show
propensity
and
you
know
all
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
in
textbooks.
why
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
what
you‘re
saying
now
about
this
procedure
wouldn't
be
equally
applicable
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
of
prior
convictions
in
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
how
normal
the
rule
is.
i'm
sure
there
are
variations
in
each
one
of
the
50
states.
but
we
are
familiar
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
telling
us
then?
if
it's
necessary,
the
due
process
clause
can
be
violated
but
in
this
case
it's
not
necessary.
justice
potter
stewart
i
never
understood
that
necessity
was
an
answer
to
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
isn't
highly
and
unconstitutionally
prejudicial
then
it
is.
and
if
it
isn't,
that
isn't.
and
if
it
is,
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
no
matter
what
the
claim
of
necessity
might
be,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
just
have
to
be
on
trial
for
his
life?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't,
perhaps
this
isn't
too
far
but
you
are
now
relying
on
the
statistics.
i
don't
quite
understand
that
--
those
statistics.
some
500
lifers
among
all
the
lifers
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
and
i
don't
understand
what
these
figures
are.
i
don't'
even
understand
the
figures.
are
they
that
among
all
the
people
serving
life
sentences,
500
of
them
are
recidivist
or
500
of
all
the
12,000
are
serving
life
sentences
or
what
other
figures
--
justice
potter
stewart
serving
life
sentences?
justice
potter
stewart
habitual
under
63?
justice
potter
stewart
out
of
how
many
serving
life
sentences?
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
understood,
mr.
fender
that
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
were
making
no
constitutional
tag
at
all
upon
the
laws
which
increase
the
punishment
for
multiple
offenders.
but
as
their
attack
was
limited
simply
and
exclusively
to
the
procedure
bringing
these
previous
convictions
before
a
jury
which
was
in
custody
of
determining
the
guilt
on
the
present
charge.
and
what
you
said
before
i
think
is
something
which
they
wouldn’t
disagree
it.
but
these
cases
involve
the
procedure
bringing
this
conviction
before
the
jury
entrusted
with
the
task
of
determining
the
guilt
of
the
person
charged.
