justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
procedure
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
included
in
the
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
there
something
more
than
just
prejudice
to
--
behind
these
cases.
after
all,
almost
all
of
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
offers
is
intended
to
be
prejudicial
like
when
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
call
an
eyewitness
to
the
crime
and
he
testified,
the
defendants
committed
a
crime.
i
don't
know
anything
more
prejudicial.
but
it's
certainly
admissible
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
--
what
if
they
decide
prejudice
here
that
really
includes
this
kind
of
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it
relevant
to
the
actual
charge
in
the
case?
is
that
it
that
the
theory
is
relevant
or
is
it
relevant
that
it's
just
too
harmful?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
relevant
that
just
because
he
committed
one
crime
a
year
ago,
it's
more
likely
that
he
committed
one
today,
is
that
--
do
you
think
that's
--
do
you
think
the
evidence
is
relevant,
the
fact
crime
evidence
is
relevant
as
to
the
commission
of
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
general
--
that's
the
general
rule
all
in
behalf
of
these.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
what
makes
it
a
denial
of
due
process
that
if
really
be,
let's
say
--
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing
it's
a
denial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
texas
holds
that
it
is
irrelevant,
does
it?
to
the
actual
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
posed
a
credibility
doesn't
it
not
a
propensity
but
when
he
takes
the
stand
well
he
really
do
in
terms
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
the
states
allow
the
--
prohibit
these
kinds
of
evidence
as
an
evidence
to
prove
of
the
time
witness
on
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
always
have
another
reason
for
letting
this.
one
is
credibility
or
crucial
pattern
and
the
patton
and
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
phillips
how
does
the
state
of
texas
justify
the
admission
of
this
testimony
without
prior
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
then
that
texas
also
constitutionally
could
generally
have
a
--
what
if
by
statute
the
legislature
they
are
hereby
changing
all
of
our
rules
of
evidence
in
the
district
court
heretofore
evidence
of
prior
crime
will
be
generally
admissible
in
the
trial
of
any
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
you
--
what's
your
idea
with
state
power
to
do
that
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
no
federal
constitutional
bar
in
your
opinion
to
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
on
what
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
then
when
the
--
but
what
about
my
--
suppose
that
texas
says
that
the
general
proposition
you
can
introduce
evidence
of
prior
crime
because
they
are
relevant.
we
think
--
the
legislature
we
think
that
evidence
is
relevant
through
trial
that's
being
tried.
do
you
say
that
he
could
have
the
rule
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
say
it's
a
due
process
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
circuit
came
along
to
say
that
the
–-
we
know
we
can't
do
that.
at
least
there
must
be
evidence
then
to
one
of
these
recidivist
statutes
to
do
job
half
through.
we
know
that
they
haven't
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
sentence
is
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
to
have
the
evidence
that
the
man
have
pleaded
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
changed
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
what's
the
theory
of
the
recidivist
cases
the
statutes
of
texas
is
or
why
did
they
--
why,
in
terms
of,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
to
deter
others
rather
than
(inaudible)
committed
the
crime
more
than
once,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
is
more
likely
that
he
will
commit
another
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
concede
the
theory
of
the
texas
recidivist
statute
to
be
that
we're
going
to
give
an
apt
sentence
because
the
person
who
has
committed
two
crimes
is
more
likely
to
commit
a
third?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
do
you
think
the
state
poses
a
greater
sentence
for
the
third
theft
of
an
automobile
and
for
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
just
to
say
punish.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
rule
has
not
been
changed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
view
is
that
the
new
--
that
the
statute
reached
statutory
changes
has
changed
this
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
--
what
could
he
have
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
five
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
theory
at
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
trial
tried
whether
it
was
for
the
prior
crime,
was
there
any
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
also
there
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
second
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
procedure
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
included
in
the
