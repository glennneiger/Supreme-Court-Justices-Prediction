mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
the
distinguished
associate
judges,
i’m
somewhat
amazed
that
the
government
ignored
the
primary
issue
of
this
argument.
and
that
issue
is
simply
this,
has
congress,
by
reason
of
the
enactment
of
certain
sketchy
and
restrictive
modes
of
recovery
for
inmates,
thereby
obliterated
rights
which
prisoners
have
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and,
your
honors,
how
can
we
say
that
this
prison
industry
fund
is
a
compensation
act?
mr.
salzman
speaks
about
the
generosity
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
that
may
be.
that
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
but
we
don’t
determine
congressional
intention
on
what
the
attorney
general
does.
we
determine
congressional
intention
upon
what
congress
has
done
and
the
nature
of
the
bills
that
were
introduced
relative
thereto.
justice
brennan
asked
the
very
pertinent
question
when
he
said,
“is
there
a
compensation
schedule?”
mr.
salzman
answered
the
question
by
saying,
“well,
the
schedule
provides
that
we
can’t
pay
over
the
amount
that
is
paid
under
federal
employees
compensation.
but
he
didn’t
tell
you
that
there
is
no
minimum.
there
is
no
schedule
at
all
under
the
so
called
“prison
fund
industry”.
the
attorney
general
determines
at
his
own
discretion
what
will
be
paid.
he’s
paid
as
always
$50
for
the
lost
of
a
finger.
he
is
paid
as
always
$4,000
for
the
loss
of
a
human
life.
now,
when
congress
was
considering
the
enactment
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
31
bills
were
introduced.
of
these
31
bills,
6
bills
specifically
provided
that
prisoners
should
not
be
entitled
to
sue
under
federal
tort
claims.
congress
rejected
every
single
one
of
these.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
certainly
am,
your
honor.
there
is
a
case
(voice
overlap).
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
the
minimum
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
to
which
he
says
(voice
overlap)
that
is
geared.
but,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
tomorrow
consists
gearing
it
to
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
and
it’s
purely
a
discretionary
provision
within
the
act.
now,
congress
rejected
all
measures
which
in
anyway
restricted
the
right
of
federal
prisoners
to
recover.
now,
this
court
in
the
muniz
decision,
very
thoroughly
analyzed
this
question.
the
government
came
before
this
court
with
the
identical
argument.
they
said
federal
tort
claims
does
not
apply
because
there
is
a
prisoner
compensation
act.
well,
chief
justice
warren
analyzed
that
question
most
intensively
and
he
concluded
that
the
compensation
act
is
a
very
questionable
act.
and
here,
in
some
of
the
provisions
which
you’ve
contained
and
which
we
must
consider
most
intensively
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
absolutely
not;
that
is
an
absolute
absurdity.
what
we
have
done
in
this
case
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
absolutely,
he
will
not
retain
any
compensation
which
he
has
received
under
any
award.
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
brooks
decision
where
a
soldier
sustained
injury
while
he
was
getting
compensation
involving
a
government
vehicle.
the
court
held
he
had
the
right
to
sue
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
justice
warren
cited
that
in
the
muniz
decision.
and
they
held
that
what
he
was
receiving
in
compensation
without
a
medically
be
deducted.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
specific
circumstances
which
are
different.
the
government
stipulated
by
agreement
that
in
addition
to
the
$20,000
received
was
the
receipt
in
the
award
that
the
compensation
should
be
paid
to
him
in
order
to
represent
a
fair
return.
this
man
is
totally
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
if
compensation
weren’t
involved
here,
the
verdict
in
this
case
would
have
been
somewhere
around
a
$100,000
to
1$150,000
and
that
is
why
the
court
or
the
government
stipulated
to
this
in
agreement.
they
said
the
$20,000
plus
the
compensation
would
represent
a
fair
award.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
your
honor,
to
this
day,
i
regret
that
i
remedied
to
that
figure
but
i
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
man
would
receive
compensation
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
that
was
a
consideration
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
award.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
at
the
time
of
the
judgment,
it
was
a
$180
per
month.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
based
upon
the
mortality
tables,
this
man
is
35
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
the
injury
he’s
probable
mortality
was
somewhere
at
around
of
35
years.
that
could
have
been
a
most
substantial
amount
probably
$67,000
or
$80,000
representing
the
compensation
plus
the
additional
award
that’s
involved
here.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
told
you
about
the
man’s
injury,
i’m
going
to
refer
to
it
later.
i
feel
that
you
understand
the
basis
and
the
reason
for
this
arrangement.
now
this
court
has
outlined
certain
references
to
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
so-called
“compensation
act”
preempts
or
overwhelms
some
act
that
congress
has
previously
enacted.
in
other
words,
we
are
to
determine
here
whether
or
not
this
prison
industry
fund
is
a
substitution
for
rights
which
are
given
to
prisoners
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
clark
in
your
johansen
decision
where
you
decided
this
question
queerly
and
categorically,
you
said
before
a
compensation
system
replaces
a
specific
right
which
congress
has
given
to
an
individual,
the
compensation
system
must
be
simple,
it
must
certain,
it
must
be
uniform.
but
pardon
me
that
was
stated
in
the
paras
decision
which
involves
soldiers.
in
the
johansen
decision,
it
was
stated
that
before
a
compensation
system
can
be
presumed
to
preempt
a
congressional
enactment,
it
must
be
all
inclusive.
now
let’s
look
at
this
compensation
system
and
see
in
what
category
is
at
feast.
first,
we
have
discussed
that
it
is
discretionary
within
the
attorney
general,
first,
as
to
whether
or
not
any
award
will
be
made
and
secondly,
as
to
any
amount
which
will
be
given.
certainly,
when
the
compensation
award
is
to
be
made
when
a
man
is
confined
to
a
federal
penitentiary,
i
don’t
know
what
might
happen
after
his
release
but
he
certainly
does
not
have
a
right
to
a
position,
an
independent
position
of
his
own
choosing
to
determine
the
degree
of
injury,
the
degree
of
permanency
–
that
is
which
were
all
determined
while
he
was
confined
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
he
has
no
right
of
administrate
of
appeal,
a
right
which
is
clearly
laid
down
in
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employees
act
and
also
in
the
soldiers
disability
act.
and,
of
course,
as
justice
fortas
has
clearly
brought
out,
on
conviction
of
any
crime
and
we
do
know
that
a
prisoner
quite
frequently
may
be
picked
up
for
vagrancy
as
he
is
released
from
a
federal
institution.
at
those
points,
whatever
award
is
made
or
whatever
award
might
be
made
is
made
determinate.
now,
i
know
in
the
pittsburg
district
it’s
frequently
the
practice
of
some
of
our
district
judges
to
impose
one
of
the
conditions
for
probation
that
a
prisoner
show/attend
charge.
his
failure
to
attend
charge
would
be
reason
to
subject
him
to
violation
of
his
probation.
that
would
terminate
his
compensation.
now,
is
this
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
again,
your
honor,
we
come
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
he
could
do
whatever
he
wants.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
know
of
no
regulation
and
even
if
there
were
regulations
that
still
would
not
be
indicative
of
congressional
intent.
but
i
know
of
no
instance
where
compensation
was
terminated
and
then
it
was
reinstated.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
and
then
we
come
to
the
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
i
would
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
the
ultimate
source
of
this
decision.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
would
think
so.
that
would
be
under
the
director
of
prisons.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
what
is
that,
your
honor,
to
the
what?
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
it
says
that
it
shall
not
exceed
any
payment
which
is
made
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employees.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
know
of
no
regulation
that
--
it
may
provide
that
it
will
not
exceed
but
it
says
nothing
about
minimum
awards.
they
can
make
any
minimum
awards
they
see
fair.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
the
practice
has
been
in
many
instances
to
make
awards
which
are
in
keeping
with
provisions
of
the
parole
employees
compensation
act.
but
there
are
many
many
cases
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
where
they
have
given
much
lower
awards
and
they
have
provided
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
they
have
given
much
lower
awards
and
provided
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
it’s
strictly
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
i
refer
you
to
an
excellent
article
which
i
cited
in
my
brief,
written
by
student
at
yale
university
in
a
bar
review
in
which
he
speaks
of
these
specific
circumstances.
now
this
information
is
certainly
not
available
to
me
as
an
attorney.
it
is
something
which
is
kept
within
the
records
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
that
he
has
specific
illustrations
on
this
article.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
director
of
prisons
and
he
secured
certain
indications
of
these
awards.
and
here,
he
cites
the
one
of
the
$50
per
finger
and
for
$4,000
for
the
loss
of
a
life.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
that
in
the
absence
of
specific
exceptions,
it
would
naturally
be
regarded
as
exclusive.
now,
your
honor,
what
are
the
specific
exception
which
apply
in
the
case
of
the
prison
industry
fund?
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
the
muniz
vs.
united
states
decision,
there
is
no
fund
which
is
available
to
inmates
who
were
sick,
who
were
aged.
those
who
have
physical
or
mental
defects,
there
is
no
fund
available
to
any
prisoners
who
are
in
transit.
there
is
no
fund
available
to
any
prisoners
who
were
confined
to
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
no
fund
available
to
any
prisoners
who
were
engaged
in
road
construction
and
under
own
(inaudible)
for
such
purposes.
there
is
no
fund
available
for
any
prisoners
who
are
lone
out
to
military
camps
and
installations
which
is
done
on
a
quite
extensive
scale.
there’s
no
fund
available
on
any
instance
where
there
is
an
intentional
assault
or
attack
on
the
federal
inmate.
and
in
addition
and
this
is
the
most
significant,
there
is
no
fund
available
for
any
inmates
who
suffer
any
injury
at
times
when
they
are
not
engaged
in
maintenance
in
prison
industry.
in
other
words,
a
federal
employee
is
covered
under
federal
employees
compensation,
eight
hours
a
day;
if
anything
happens
to
him
during
that
eight
hour
period,
he
is
subject
immediately
to
receive
federal
employees
compensation.
a
federal
prisoner,
call
him
an
employee
or
what
you
will
is
engaged
in
his
occupation
24
hours
a
day.
the
only
benefit
which
is
specifically
available
to
him,
if
by
coincidence
at
the
time
of
the
injury
occurs,
he
happens
to
have
been
engaged
in
this
specific
type
of
activity.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
the
ordinary
workmen’s
compensation,
your
honor,
provides
a
compensation
automatically
applies
regardless
of
negligence
during
the
working
hours,
during
the
eight
hour
day
that
the
party
is
engaged
in
his
occupation.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
sir,
it
would
not
apply.
let
us
say
that
there’s
a
fire
on
the
louisburg
penitentiary
at
night
and
every
prisoner
has
caused
to
suffer
death
as
a
result
of
that
fire
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
every
prisoner,
every
inmate
were
to
suffer
death
as
a
result
of
that
fire.
there
would
be
no
award
under
any
compensation
program.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
in
any
of
the
event
if
negligence
can
be
shown,
if
that
fire
resulted
as
a
result
of
a
defective
type
of
flow
or
defective
furnace,
there
would
be
a
right
of
action
under
federal
tort
claims.
this
very
issue
arose
in
the
case
of
a
soldier
who
suffered
death
as
a
result
of
fire
in
a
military
camp
in
a
military
installation
that
happened
at
night.
and
he
sued
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
court
said
he
cannot
recover
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
because
he
has
covered
under
the
soldiers
disability
act,
which
is
an
all
inclusive
compensation
system.
in
other
words,
if
we
have
a
compensation
system
here,
that
was
comparable
to
any
degree
to
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
to
the
soldiers
disability
act,
to
that
provided
in
the
case
of
persons
on
the
ships
of
the
united
states,
we
would
have
no
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
he
is
no
longer
an
employee
after
he
returns.
but
i
say
a
prisoner
is
prisoner
24
hours
a
day
just
as
a
soldier
–
a
solider
is
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
correct.
it
is
very
limited
in
the
great
many
as
i
pointed
or
not
engaged
in
any
type
of
activity.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
is
covered
while
he
is
working
under
these
restrictive
circumstances
which
i
have
indicated.
and,
your
honor,
as
pointed
out
that
before
you
can
say
that
congress
intended
to
obliterate
right
which
exists
under
a
basic
hall
of
the
land,
you
must
show
that
congress
in
rule
of
that
act
has
instituted
an
act
which
is
all
inclusive.
and
i
point
out,
your
honor,
that
this
act
is
not
all
inclusive.
it
is
very
skeptic
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
cover
under
both?
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
only
in
the
event
that
negligence
can
be
shown.
when
there’s
no
negligence,
there’s
no
basis
of
any
recovery
under
any
recovery
under
tort.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
and
that
is
why
i
pointed
out,
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
a
comprehensive
compensation
system.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
would
get
nothing
on
the
compensation
unless
he
was
engaged
in
a
specific
activity.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
there
does
not
have
to
be
any
negligence
under
the
compensation
act
where
he
is
engaged
in
a
specific
activity.
but
where
he
is
not
engaged
in
night
time
at
prison
industry,
he
gets
nothing
under
compensation.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
if
he
was
injured
while
engaged
in
one
of
these
specific
activities.
but
as
i
point
out,
your
honor,
there’s
so
many
prisoners
who
were
not
engaged
in
specific
activities
of
this
kind
and
as,
your
honor,
pointed
out
in
your
decision
in
johansen,
in
order
for
the
act
to
be
considered
to
show
a
congressional
intention
to
bypass
a
federal
statute,
you
must
show
that
the
statute
which
has
replaced
it
is
is
of
such
a
nature
that
congress
indicated
an
intention
to
substitute
it
for
federal
tort
claims.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
sir.
i
say,
your
honor
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well
then,
your
honor,
there’s
no
basis
of
any
recovery
but
i
say
this
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
cannot
unless
he
is
engaged
in
specific
activity.
now,
i
say
if
there
was
fire
for
example
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
at
the
present
time,
under
federal
tort
claims,
i
must
to
establish
negligence
and
i
say
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
these
cases
was
to
discourage
acts
on
the
part
of
prisoner
officials
from
committing
acts
of
negligence
which
would
result
in
serious
injury
to
federal
prisoners.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
your
honor.
i
must
say
that
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
is
getting
240
a
month.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
as
long
as
his
disability
continues
which
would
be,
in
this
case,
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
your
honor,
the
government
stipulated
here
that
there
isn’t
negligence.
that’s
one
of
the
stipulation
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
true.
but,
your
honor,
the
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
to
give
the
right
where
negligence
exists
to
people
to
recover.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
correct.
but
the
trouble
is,
this
other,
this
substitute
to
which
we
refer
is
not
a
comprehensive
system
and
therefore
is
not
a
complete
substitution.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
your
honor,
we
are
going
to
say
that
through
the
magnanimity
of
the
attorney
generals’
office,
we
were
able
to
modify
and
alter
congressional
intent.
that
is
one
thing.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
my
theory
is
that
because
of
the
stipulation
here,
we
can
collect
under
both.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
they’re
not
alternative
remedies.
they
are
combined
remedies.
this
court
has
held
in
brooks
vs.
united
states,
it
was
held
in
brown
vs.
the
united
states
that
the
right
to
these
two
remedies
exists
unless
congress
indicated
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
precisely
my
argument.
and
i
say
this
that
in
most
cases
where
compensation
system
has
been
provided
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
it
is
so
provided
in
the
provisions
of
the
compensation
system
itself
and
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
so
provides.
of
course,
i
say
this
that,
as
i
reiterate,
that
if
federal
employees
compensation
or
soldiers
disability
compensation
existed
here
on
that
basis,
i
think
there
would
be
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
substitute
that
remedy.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
without
an
express
provision,
they
would
go
along
with
the
government
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
precisely.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
thanks
to
the
application
of
the
act
if
it
is
applied.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
but,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say,
i
don’t
feel
that
we
can
construe
congressional
intention
on
what
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
has
done.
we
must
construe
congressional
intention
by
the
acts
of
congress
and
this
court
has
held
that
before
we
can
say
that
congress
has
substituted
another
remedy
for
a
right
given
to
a
group
of
our
people
under
specific
act,
that
intention
must
be
established
first
by
a
clear,
certain
and
uniform
act
and
secondly,
by
an
act
which
is
all
inclusive.
i
have
pointed
this
many
many
instances
for
prisoners
who
would
not
be
covered
under
the
act.
i
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
a
certain
act.
it
is
an
act,
which
is
so
beautifully
stated
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
this
sentence.
the
only
merges
on
examination,
therefore,
is
a
severely
restrictive
system
of
compensation
permeated
at
all
levels
that
a
very
prison
control
and
dominion
which
was
at
the
origin
of
the
inmate
injuries.
now,
let
me
tell
you
why
congress
intended
to
give
prisoners
this
additional
protection.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
case
of
over
indulgence.
we
know
this
is
a
fact.
sutherland
and
his
work
on
criminology.
he
has
pointed
out
that
a
prisoner
has
no
freedom
of
choice,
no
freedom
of
action.
his
every
act,
his
every
move
is
controlled
by
prisoner
authority.
and
we
know
that
when
prisoner
authorities
order
a
prisoner
to
perform
a
certain
act,
and
when
those
authorities
direct
him
to
perform
an
act
in
a
negligent
matter
which
is
dangerous
to
his
well-being,
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
those
individuals
and
to
give
them
the
right
and
to
discourage
prison
authorities
from
subjecting
inmates
to
these
dangerous
conditions.
in
the
case
in
question,
we
have
a
prisoner.
he
was
not
guilty
of
any
active
violence.
he
was
simply
guilty
of
having
passed
some
bad
shots.
he
was
serving
a
term
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
he
was
a
carpenter.
he
was
told
to
go
up
in
the
powerhouse
where
a
window
had
exploded
and
to
replace
the
window.
they
refused
to
provide
him
any
stepladder,
no
scaffolding
was
provided.
he
had
to
climb
15
feet
on
the
side
of
the
wall.
the
wall,
incidentally,
is
made
of
tile.
water
had
come
in,
rain
had
come
in,
the
tile
had
been
slippery.
there
were
girdles
that
were
about
7
ft.
to
8
ft.
apart
and
he
tried
to
climb
up
cat
like
into
this
position.
he
bounced
a
five
foot
piece
of
glass
vicariously
on
his
shoulder,
he
attempted
to
insert
it
into
the
window
with
the
use
of
a
screwdriver.
and
the
glass
broke,
he
went
to
through
the
window
and
he
fell
37
feet
to
the
area
below.
now,
your
honors,
i
see
that
congress
intended
to
such
persons,
because
of
the
fragrant
negligent
act
of
prison
officials,
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
but
let
me
say
this,
that
the
prison
act
was
enacted
before
the
federal
tort
act.
and
at
the
time
the
federal
tort
act
was
passed,
the
restrictions
as
against
the
prisoners
was
not
placed,
was
not
included.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
i
would
say
this.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
feel
that
we
should
presume
or
infer
inferences
against
persons
who
were
granted
certain
rights
under
congressional
enactment.
i
believe
the
burden
should
be
on
the
party
who
say
that
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
an
act,
to
establish
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
act.
but
more
significantly,
it
would
appear
that
in
the
interest
of
good
sound
public
policy,
those
prisoners
who
have
no
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
that
compensation
is
awarded,
we
don’t
have
this
but
–
returning
to
society,
a
subject
to
having
this
grant
was
drawn
from
them.
i
say,
your
honor,
we
should
not
construe
congress
as
having
created
such
an
inference.
to
the
contrary,
we
should
infer
that
congress
has
created
this
fund
with
the
purpose
of
helping
prisoners
where
negligence
does
not
exist
so
as
not
to
make
them
a
drag
upon
society.
and
that
in
addition,
where
negligence
has
been
committed
on
part
of
officials
to
discourage
the
retention
and
then
the
appointment
of
such
officials,
that
prisoners
should
have
the
right
to
sue
under
the
rights
of
federal
tort
without
any
question
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
compensation
is
a
right
which
is
inherent
if
it
were
awarded
to
him
and
the
compensation
has
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
time
this
prisoner
under
then
the
court
he
is
receiving
compensation.
and
the
only
basis
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
see
no
reason
why
not.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
say
he
has
the
right
to
recover
under
both
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
has
the
right
to
recover
under
both
and
the
amount
of
compensation
awarded
should
be
deducted
from
the
amount
of
the
award
under
the
federal
tort
claims
which
is
done.
in
all
jones
act
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
it’s
a
matter
of
his
own
choice.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
absolutely
not.
and
this
court
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
right.
exactly,
and
this
court
has
so
declared
in
the
case
of
brooks
vs.
united
states
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
it
said
this,
your
honor,
that
this
court
will
not
impose
the
doctrine
of
the
election
of
remedies
unless
congress
has
indicated
an
intention
to
do
so.
and
this
court
will
not
limit
remedies
available
to
individuals.
we
know
that
in
ed
modi
cases
and
jones
sack
cases,
person
sue
under
compensation
on
occasion
and
whatever
award
they
receive
under
the
jones
act
is
automatically
deducted
from
whatever
award
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
whatever
award
is
made
under
compensation,
your
honor,
would
automatically
be
deducted.
there
are
two
remedies
available
to
federal
prisoners
where
negligence
exists
on
the
part
of
federal
employees
and
the
congress
has
done
this.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
and
congress
has
done
this
in
order
to
protect
federal
prisoners
from
sadistic
and
arbitrary
and
capricious
prison
officials.
and
that
is
what
they
had
in
mind;
they
want
to
discourage
it.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
the
distinguished
associate
judges,
i’m
somewhat
amazed
that
the
government
ignored
the
primary
issue
of
this
argument.
and
that
issue
is
simply
this,
has
congress,
by
reason
of
the
enactment
of
certain
sketchy
and
restrictive
modes
of
recovery
for
inmates,
thereby
obliterated
rights
which
prisoners
have
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and,
your
honors,
how
can
we
say
that
this
prison
industry
fund
is
a
compensation
act?
mr.
salzman
speaks
about
the
generosity
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
that
may
be.
that
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
but
we
don’t
determine
congressional
intention
on
what
the
attorney
general
does.
we
determine
congressional
intention
upon
what
congress
has
done
and
the
nature
of
the
bills
that
were
introduced
relative
thereto.
justice
brennan
asked
the
very
pertinent
question
when
he
said,
“is
there
a
compensation
schedule?”
mr.
salzman
answered
the
question
by
saying,
“well,
the
schedule
provides
that
we
can’t
pay
over
the
amount
that
is
paid
under
federal
employees
compensation.
but
he
didn’t
tell
you
that
there
is
no
minimum.
there
is
no
schedule
at
all
under
the
so
called
“prison
fund
industry”.
the
attorney
general
determines
at
his
own
discretion
what
will
be
paid.
he’s
paid
as
always
$50
for
the
lost
of
a
finger.
he
is
paid
as
always
$4,000
for
the
loss
of
a
human
life.
now,
when
congress
was
considering
the
enactment
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
31
bills
were
introduced.
of
these
31
bills,
6
bills
specifically
provided
that
prisoners
should
not
be
entitled
to
sue
under
federal
tort
claims.
congress
rejected
every
single
one
of
these.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
certainly
am,
your
honor.
there
is
a
case
(voice
overlap).
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
the
minimum
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
to
which
he
says
(voice
overlap)
that
is
geared.
but,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
tomorrow
consists
gearing
it
to
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
and
it’s
purely
a
discretionary
provision
within
the
act.
now,
congress
rejected
all
measures
which
in
anyway
restricted
the
right
of
federal
prisoners
to
recover.
now,
this
court
in
the
muniz
decision,
very
thoroughly
analyzed
this
question.
the
government
came
before
this
court
with
the
identical
argument.
they
said
federal
tort
claims
does
not
apply
because
there
is
a
prisoner
compensation
act.
well,
chief
justice
warren
analyzed
that
question
most
intensively
and
he
concluded
that
the
compensation
act
is
a
very
questionable
act.
and
here,
in
some
of
the
provisions
which
you’ve
contained
and
which
we
must
consider
most
intensively
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
absolutely
not;
that
is
an
absolute
absurdity.
what
we
have
done
in
this
case
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
absolutely,
he
will
not
retain
any
compensation
which
he
has
received
under
any
award.
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
brooks
decision
where
a
soldier
sustained
injury
while
he
was
getting
compensation
involving
a
government
vehicle.
the
court
held
he
had
the
right
to
sue
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
justice
warren
cited
that
in
the
muniz
decision.
and
they
held
that
what
he
was
receiving
in
compensation
without
a
medically
be
deducted.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
specific
circumstances
which
are
different.
the
government
stipulated
by
agreement
that
in
addition
to
the
$20,000
received
was
the
receipt
in
the
award
that
the
compensation
should
be
paid
to
him
in
order
to
represent
a
fair
return.
this
man
is
totally
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
if
compensation
weren’t
involved
here,
the
verdict
in
this
case
would
have
been
somewhere
around
a
$100,000
to
1$150,000
and
that
is
why
the
court
or
the
government
stipulated
to
this
in
agreement.
they
said
the
$20,000
plus
the
compensation
would
represent
a
fair
award.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
your
honor,
to
this
day,
i
regret
that
i
remedied
to
that
figure
but
i
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
man
would
receive
compensation
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
that
was
a
consideration
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
award.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
at
the
time
of
the
judgment,
it
was
a
$180
per
month.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
based
upon
the
mortality
tables,
this
man
is
35
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
the
injury
he’s
probable
mortality
was
somewhere
at
around
of
35
years.
that
could
have
been
a
most
substantial
amount
probably
$67,000
or
$80,000
representing
the
compensation
plus
the
additional
award
that’s
involved
here.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
told
you
about
the
man’s
injury,
i’m
going
to
refer
to
it
later.
i
feel
that
you
understand
the
basis
and
the
reason
for
this
arrangement.
now
this
court
has
outlined
certain
references
to
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
so-called
“compensation
act”
preempts
or
overwhelms
some
act
that
congress
has
previously
enacted.
in
other
words,
we
are
to
determine
here
whether
or
not
this
prison
industry
fund
is
a
substitution
for
rights
which
are
given
to
prisoners
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
clark
in
your
johansen
decision
where
you
decided
this
question
queerly
and
categorically,
you
said
before
a
compensation
system
replaces
a
specific
right
which
congress
has
given
to
an
individual,
the
compensation
system
must
be
simple,
it
must
certain,
it
must
be
uniform.
but
pardon
me
that
was
stated
in
the
paras
decision
which
involves
soldiers.
in
the
johansen
decision,
it
was
stated
that
before
a
compensation
system
can
be
presumed
to
preempt
a
congressional
enactment,
it
must
be
all
inclusive.
now
let’s
look
at
this
compensation
system
and
see
in
what
category
is
at
feast.
first,
we
have
discussed
that
it
is
discretionary
within
the
attorney
general,
first,
as
to
whether
or
not
any
award
will
be
made
and
secondly,
as
to
any
amount
which
will
be
given.
certainly,
when
the
compensation
award
is
to
be
made
when
a
man
is
confined
to
a
federal
penitentiary,
i
don’t
know
what
might
happen
after
his
release
but
he
certainly
does
not
have
a
right
to
a
position,
an
independent
position
of
his
own
choosing
to
determine
the
degree
of
injury,
the
degree
of
permanency
–
that
is
which
were
all
determined
while
he
was
confined
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
he
has
no
right
of
administrate
of
appeal,
a
right
which
is
clearly
laid
down
in
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employees
act
and
also
in
the
soldiers
disability
act.
and,
of
course,
as
justice
fortas
has
clearly
brought
out,
on
conviction
of
any
crime
and
we
do
know
that
a
prisoner
quite
frequently
may
be
picked
up
for
vagrancy
as
he
is
released
from
a
federal
institution.
at
those
points,
whatever
award
is
made
or
whatever
award
might
be
made
is
made
determinate.
now,
i
know
in
the
pittsburg
district
it’s
frequently
the
practice
of
some
of
our
district
judges
to
impose
one
of
the
conditions
for
probation
that
a
prisoner
show/attend
charge.
his
failure
to
attend
charge
would
be
reason
to
subject
him
to
violation
of
his
probation.
that
would
terminate
his
compensation.
now,
is
this
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
again,
your
honor,
we
come
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
he
could
do
whatever
he
wants.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
know
of
no
regulation
and
even
if
there
were
regulations
that
still
would
not
be
indicative
of
congressional
intent.
but
i
know
of
no
instance
where
compensation
was
terminated
and
then
it
was
reinstated.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
and
then
we
come
to
the
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
i
would
think
that
the
attorney
general
is
the
ultimate
source
of
this
decision.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
would
think
so.
that
would
be
under
the
director
of
prisons.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
what
is
that,
your
honor,
to
the
what?
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
it
says
that
it
shall
not
exceed
any
payment
which
is
made
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employees.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
know
of
no
regulation
that
--
it
may
provide
that
it
will
not
exceed
but
it
says
nothing
about
minimum
awards.
they
can
make
any
minimum
awards
they
see
fair.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
the
practice
has
been
in
many
instances
to
make
awards
which
are
in
keeping
with
provisions
of
the
parole
employees
compensation
act.
but
there
are
many
many
cases
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
where
they
have
given
much
lower
awards
and
they
have
provided
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
they
have
given
much
lower
awards
and
provided
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
it’s
strictly
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
i
refer
you
to
an
excellent
article
which
i
cited
in
my
brief,
written
by
student
at
yale
university
in
a
bar
review
in
which
he
speaks
of
these
specific
circumstances.
now
this
information
is
certainly
not
available
to
me
as
an
attorney.
it
is
something
which
is
kept
within
the
records
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
that
he
has
specific
illustrations
on
this
article.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
director
of
prisons
and
he
secured
certain
indications
of
these
awards.
and
here,
he
cites
the
one
of
the
$50
per
finger
and
for
$4,000
for
the
loss
of
a
life.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
that
in
the
absence
of
specific
exceptions,
it
would
naturally
be
regarded
as
exclusive.
now,
your
honor,
what
are
the
specific
exception
which
apply
in
the
case
of
the
prison
industry
fund?
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
the
muniz
vs.
united
states
decision,
there
is
no
fund
which
is
available
to
inmates
who
were
sick,
who
were
aged.
those
who
have
physical
or
mental
defects,
there
is
no
fund
available
to
any
prisoners
who
are
in
transit.
there
is
no
fund
available
to
any
prisoners
who
were
confined
to
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
no
fund
available
to
any
prisoners
who
were
engaged
in
road
construction
and
under
own
(inaudible)
for
such
purposes.
there
is
no
fund
available
for
any
prisoners
who
are
lone
out
to
military
camps
and
installations
which
is
done
on
a
quite
extensive
scale.
there’s
no
fund
available
on
any
instance
where
there
is
an
intentional
assault
or
attack
on
the
federal
inmate.
and
in
addition
and
this
is
the
most
significant,
there
is
no
fund
available
for
any
inmates
who
suffer
any
injury
at
times
when
they
are
not
engaged
in
maintenance
in
prison
industry.
in
other
words,
a
federal
employee
is
covered
under
federal
employees
compensation,
eight
hours
a
day;
if
anything
happens
to
him
during
that
eight
hour
period,
he
is
subject
immediately
to
receive
federal
employees
compensation.
a
federal
prisoner,
call
him
an
employee
or
what
you
will
is
engaged
in
his
occupation
24
hours
a
day.
the
only
benefit
which
is
specifically
available
to
him,
if
by
coincidence
at
the
time
of
the
injury
occurs,
he
happens
to
have
been
engaged
in
this
specific
type
of
activity.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
the
ordinary
workmen’s
compensation,
your
honor,
provides
a
compensation
automatically
applies
regardless
of
negligence
during
the
working
hours,
during
the
eight
hour
day
that
the
party
is
engaged
in
his
occupation.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
sir,
it
would
not
apply.
let
us
say
that
there’s
a
fire
on
the
louisburg
penitentiary
at
night
and
every
prisoner
has
caused
to
suffer
death
as
a
result
of
that
fire
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
every
prisoner,
every
inmate
were
to
suffer
death
as
a
result
of
that
fire.
there
would
be
no
award
under
any
compensation
program.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
in
any
of
the
event
if
negligence
can
be
shown,
if
that
fire
resulted
as
a
result
of
a
defective
type
of
flow
or
defective
furnace,
there
would
be
a
right
of
action
under
federal
tort
claims.
this
very
issue
arose
in
the
case
of
a
soldier
who
suffered
death
as
a
result
of
fire
in
a
military
camp
in
a
military
installation
that
happened
at
night.
and
he
sued
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
court
said
he
cannot
recover
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
because
he
has
covered
under
the
soldiers
disability
act,
which
is
an
all
inclusive
compensation
system.
in
other
words,
if
we
have
a
compensation
system
here,
that
was
comparable
to
any
degree
to
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
to
the
soldiers
disability
act,
to
that
provided
in
the
case
of
persons
on
the
ships
of
the
united
states,
we
would
have
no
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
he
is
no
longer
an
employee
after
he
returns.
but
i
say
a
prisoner
is
prisoner
24
hours
a
day
just
as
a
soldier
–
a
solider
is
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
correct.
it
is
very
limited
in
the
great
many
as
i
pointed
or
not
engaged
in
any
type
of
activity.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
is
covered
while
he
is
working
under
these
restrictive
circumstances
which
i
have
indicated.
and,
your
honor,
as
pointed
out
that
before
you
can
say
that
congress
intended
to
obliterate
right
which
exists
under
a
basic
hall
of
the
land,
you
must
show
that
congress
in
rule
of
that
act
has
instituted
an
act
which
is
all
inclusive.
and
i
point
out,
your
honor,
that
this
act
is
not
all
inclusive.
it
is
very
skeptic
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
cover
under
both?
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
only
in
the
event
that
negligence
can
be
shown.
when
there’s
no
negligence,
there’s
no
basis
of
any
recovery
under
any
recovery
under
tort.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
and
that
is
why
i
pointed
out,
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
a
comprehensive
compensation
system.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
would
get
nothing
on
the
compensation
unless
he
was
engaged
in
a
specific
activity.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
there
does
not
have
to
be
any
negligence
under
the
compensation
act
where
he
is
engaged
in
a
specific
activity.
but
where
he
is
not
engaged
in
night
time
at
prison
industry,
he
gets
nothing
under
compensation.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
if
he
was
injured
while
engaged
in
one
of
these
specific
activities.
but
as
i
point
out,
your
honor,
there’s
so
many
prisoners
who
were
not
engaged
in
specific
activities
of
this
kind
and
as,
your
honor,
pointed
out
in
your
decision
in
johansen,
in
order
for
the
act
to
be
considered
to
show
a
congressional
intention
to
bypass
a
federal
statute,
you
must
show
that
the
statute
which
has
replaced
it
is
is
of
such
a
nature
that
congress
indicated
an
intention
to
substitute
it
for
federal
tort
claims.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
sir.
i
say,
your
honor
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well
then,
your
honor,
there’s
no
basis
of
any
recovery
but
i
say
this
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
cannot
unless
he
is
engaged
in
specific
activity.
now,
i
say
if
there
was
fire
for
example
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
at
the
present
time,
under
federal
tort
claims,
i
must
to
establish
negligence
and
i
say
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
these
cases
was
to
discourage
acts
on
the
part
of
prisoner
officials
from
committing
acts
of
negligence
which
would
result
in
serious
injury
to
federal
prisoners.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
no,
your
honor.
i
must
say
that
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
is
getting
240
a
month.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
as
long
as
his
disability
continues
which
would
be,
in
this
case,
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
your
honor,
the
government
stipulated
here
that
there
isn’t
negligence.
that’s
one
of
the
stipulation
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
true.
but,
your
honor,
the
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
to
give
the
right
where
negligence
exists
to
people
to
recover.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
correct.
but
the
trouble
is,
this
other,
this
substitute
to
which
we
refer
is
not
a
comprehensive
system
and
therefore
is
not
a
complete
substitution.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
your
honor,
we
are
going
to
say
that
through
the
magnanimity
of
the
attorney
generals’
office,
we
were
able
to
modify
and
alter
congressional
intent.
that
is
one
thing.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
my
theory
is
that
because
of
the
stipulation
here,
we
can
collect
under
both.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
they’re
not
alternative
remedies.
they
are
combined
remedies.
this
court
has
held
in
brooks
vs.
united
states,
it
was
held
in
brown
vs.
the
united
states
that
the
right
to
these
two
remedies
exists
unless
congress
indicated
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that
is
precisely
my
argument.
and
i
say
this
that
in
most
cases
where
compensation
system
has
been
provided
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
it
is
so
provided
in
the
provisions
of
the
compensation
system
itself
and
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
so
provides.
of
course,
i
say
this
that,
as
i
reiterate,
that
if
federal
employees
compensation
or
soldiers
disability
compensation
existed
here
on
that
basis,
i
think
there
would
be
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
substitute
that
remedy.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
without
an
express
provision,
they
would
go
along
with
the
government
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
precisely.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
thanks
to
the
application
of
the
act
if
it
is
applied.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
but,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say,
i
don’t
feel
that
we
can
construe
congressional
intention
on
what
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
has
done.
we
must
construe
congressional
intention
by
the
acts
of
congress
and
this
court
has
held
that
before
we
can
say
that
congress
has
substituted
another
remedy
for
a
right
given
to
a
group
of
our
people
under
specific
act,
that
intention
must
be
established
first
by
a
clear,
certain
and
uniform
act
and
secondly,
by
an
act
which
is
all
inclusive.
i
have
pointed
this
many
many
instances
for
prisoners
who
would
not
be
covered
under
the
act.
i
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
a
certain
act.
it
is
an
act,
which
is
so
beautifully
stated
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
this
sentence.
the
only
merges
on
examination,
therefore,
is
a
severely
restrictive
system
of
compensation
permeated
at
all
levels
that
a
very
prison
control
and
dominion
which
was
at
the
origin
of
the
inmate
injuries.
now,
let
me
tell
you
why
congress
intended
to
give
prisoners
this
additional
protection.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
case
of
over
indulgence.
we
know
this
is
a
fact.
sutherland
and
his
work
on
criminology.
he
has
pointed
out
that
a
prisoner
has
no
freedom
of
choice,
no
freedom
of
action.
his
every
act,
his
every
move
is
controlled
by
prisoner
authority.
and
we
know
that
when
prisoner
authorities
order
a
prisoner
to
perform
a
certain
act,
and
when
those
authorities
direct
him
to
perform
an
act
in
a
negligent
matter
which
is
dangerous
to
his
well-being,
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
those
individuals
and
to
give
them
the
right
and
to
discourage
prison
authorities
from
subjecting
inmates
to
these
dangerous
conditions.
in
the
case
in
question,
we
have
a
prisoner.
he
was
not
guilty
of
any
active
violence.
he
was
simply
guilty
of
having
passed
some
bad
shots.
he
was
serving
a
term
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
he
was
a
carpenter.
he
was
told
to
go
up
in
the
powerhouse
where
a
window
had
exploded
and
to
replace
the
window.
they
refused
to
provide
him
any
stepladder,
no
scaffolding
was
provided.
he
had
to
climb
15
feet
on
the
side
of
the
wall.
the
wall,
incidentally,
is
made
of
tile.
water
had
come
in,
rain
had
come
in,
the
tile
had
been
slippery.
there
were
girdles
that
were
about
7
ft.
to
8
ft.
apart
and
he
tried
to
climb
up
cat
like
into
this
position.
he
bounced
a
five
foot
piece
of
glass
vicariously
on
his
shoulder,
he
attempted
to
insert
it
into
the
window
with
the
use
of
a
screwdriver.
and
the
glass
broke,
he
went
to
through
the
window
and
he
fell
37
feet
to
the
area
below.
now,
your
honors,
i
see
that
congress
intended
to
such
persons,
because
of
the
fragrant
negligent
act
of
prison
officials,
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
but
let
me
say
this,
that
the
prison
act
was
enacted
before
the
federal
tort
act.
and
at
the
time
the
federal
tort
act
was
passed,
the
restrictions
as
against
the
prisoners
was
not
placed,
was
not
included.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
well,
i
would
say
this.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
feel
that
we
should
presume
or
infer
inferences
against
persons
who
were
granted
certain
rights
under
congressional
enactment.
i
believe
the
burden
should
be
on
the
party
who
say
that
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
an
act,
to
establish
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
act.
but
more
significantly,
it
would
appear
that
in
the
interest
of
good
sound
public
policy,
those
prisoners
who
have
no
right
to
counsel
at
the
time
that
compensation
is
awarded,
we
don’t
have
this
but
–
returning
to
society,
a
subject
to
having
this
grant
was
drawn
from
them.
i
say,
your
honor,
we
should
not
construe
congress
as
having
created
such
an
inference.
to
the
contrary,
we
should
infer
that
congress
has
created
this
fund
with
the
purpose
of
helping
prisoners
where
negligence
does
not
exist
so
as
not
to
make
them
a
drag
upon
society.
and
that
in
addition,
where
negligence
has
been
committed
on
part
of
officials
to
discourage
the
retention
and
then
the
appointment
of
such
officials,
that
prisoners
should
have
the
right
to
sue
under
the
rights
of
federal
tort
without
any
question
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
compensation
is
a
right
which
is
inherent
if
it
were
awarded
to
him
and
the
compensation
has
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
time
this
prisoner
under
then
the
court
he
is
receiving
compensation.
and
the
only
basis
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
see
no
reason
why
not.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
i
say
he
has
the
right
to
recover
under
both
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
he
has
the
right
to
recover
under
both
and
the
amount
of
compensation
awarded
should
be
deducted
from
the
amount
of
the
award
under
the
federal
tort
claims
which
is
done.
in
all
jones
act
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
it’s
a
matter
of
his
own
choice.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
absolutely
not.
and
this
court
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
that’s
right.
exactly,
and
this
court
has
so
declared
in
the
case
of
brooks
vs.
united
states
--
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
it
said
this,
your
honor,
that
this
court
will
not
impose
the
doctrine
of
the
election
of
remedies
unless
congress
has
indicated
an
intention
to
do
so.
and
this
court
will
not
limit
remedies
available
to
individuals.
we
know
that
in
ed
modi
cases
and
jones
sack
cases,
person
sue
under
compensation
on
occasion
and
whatever
award
they
receive
under
the
jones
act
is
automatically
deducted
from
whatever
award
–
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
whatever
award
is
made
under
compensation,
your
honor,
would
automatically
be
deducted.
there
are
two
remedies
available
to
federal
prisoners
where
negligence
exists
on
the
part
of
federal
employees
and
the
congress
has
done
this.
mr.
gerald
n.
ziskind
exactly.
and
congress
has
done
this
in
order
to
protect
federal
prisoners
from
sadistic
and
arbitrary
and
capricious
prison
officials.
and
that
is
what
they
had
in
mind;
they
want
to
discourage
it.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
