mr.
richard
s.
salzman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
commence
this
suit
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act
to
recover
for
injuries
he
incurred
in
the
cause
of
work
he
was
performing
while
a
federal
prisoner
in
the
federal
penitentiary
of
louisburg,
pennsylvania.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute
for
purposes
of
this
hearing.
in
private
life,
respondent
had
employed
upon
occasions
as
a
carpenter.
while
imprisoned
he
was
assigned
to
do
maintenance
work.
in
the
course
of
replacing
a
broken
window
some
height
above
the
floor,
he
lost
his
balance,
fell
and
was
severely
injured.
as
a
result
of
that
injury,
he
applied
for
an
award
of
workmen’s
compensation.
under
the
prisoners
compensation
statute,
18
usc
4126,
he
was
awarded
such
compensation
in
the
sum
of
$180
a
month.
but
as
a
result,
this
summer
of
congress
raising
generally,
the
labels
of
workmen’s
compensation
paid
throughout
the
united
states
to
all
non-government
employees.
he
is
now
receiving
$245
a
month
in
compensation
from
the
united
states
for
the
injury
he
received
in
the
course
of
his
prison
work.
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
that
prisoner
compensation
remedy
is
like
all
other
workmen’s
compensation
remedies
provided
for
any
employee
or
anyone
working
for
the
united
states,
an
exclusive
one
and
therefore
precludes
this
suit
under
the
tort
claims
act
based
on
those
very
same
injuries.
or
stated
the
other
way,
whether
congress
intended
the
prisoner
compensation
remedy
to
be
different
from
the
compensation
remedies
provided
for
every
other
soldier
or
civilian
employee
of
the
government
or
any
federal
employee
of
any
branch
with
the
government
and
that
the
prisoner
was
not
only
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation
without
regard
to
fault.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes,
your
honor,
the
regulations
on
the
statute
provide
that,
it’s
on
28
cfr
31.2,
it
provides
that
anyone
who
is
injured
will
be
granted
an
award
of
compensation,
medical
benefits
and
the
like.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
the
answer,
yes.
the
compensation
is
actually
paid
when
he
leaves
the
prison
the
theory
being
that
compensation
is
to
replace
lost
earning
power
and
he
had
been
earning.
but
that’s
not
entirely
accurate,
sir.
if
the
prisoner
was
employed
in
prison
industries
where
he
did
get
a
salary,
then
he
does
continue
to
receive
his
pay
while
in
prison
even
though
he
can’t
work
for
prison
industries.
industry
is
a
job
to
the
apprentice
program,
contain
a
small
stipend
and
the
prisoner
may
earn
several
hundred
dollars
a
year.
he
continued
to
get
that.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
the
compensation
schedule
follows
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
that
is
the
administrators
had
interpreted
as
meaning
that
for
total
disability,
a
prisoner
who
will
receive
the
minimum
award
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
on
a
theory
that
the
prisoner
compensation
statute
says,
in
no
event
shall
compensation
under
that
statute
exceed
would
be
given
to
federal
employee.
that’s
$245
a
month.
there
is
a
schedule
of
benefits
paid
in
a
measure
of
the
minimum
wage.
whatever
the
federal
minimum
wage
is,
it’s
determined
as
to
what
the
prisoner’s
earning
power,
it’s
a
purposes
of
paying
benefits.
indeed,
this
is
also
payments
paid
for
lost
of
a
member
for
example.
off
hand,
i
would
assume
that
the
prisoner
would
loss
the
hand.
i
asked
the
prisoner
to
calculate
that
and
receive
about
$8,000
in
cash
award,
probably
not
in
a
lump
sum
benefit
as
a
matter
of
a
practice
plus
any
disability
benefits
he
would
result
from
it.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
as
far
as
i
can
see,
yes,
your
honor,
is
and
it
can
par
with
federal
employees.
it’s
applied
without
regard
to
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
or
fault
on
the
part
of
the
government.
indeed,
in
many
circumstances,
the
prisoners
who
were
employed
in
jobs
where
they’re
working
alongside
federal
employees.
for
example,
in
some
say,
a
prisoner
is
used
to
help
collect
trash
and
garbage
and
part
of
the
crew
is
made
up
of
ordinary
federal
employees
-
gs
1,
gs
2
employees
–
and
when
did
we
have
a
case
where
prisoner’s
injured
when
he
fell
of
the
truck.
and
we
would
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
compensation,
if
he
is
totally
disabled.
if
the
employee
had
fallen
off
the
truck,
it’s
quite
clear
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
compensation
and
would
not
be
entitled
to
sue
in
court.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
not
really,
your
honor.
the
act
itself,
that
is
the
compensation
act
that
was
passed,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
1932
originally
when
there
is
no
recovery
against
the
united
states
at
all
and
no
tort
claims
act.
it’s
passed
the
attorney
general’s
urging
to
provide
protection
for
prisoners
working
in
prison
industries
and
the
act,
it
says,
“compensation
may
be
paid
out
of
the
prison
industries
fund”
--
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
i
can
say
the
actual
lines
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
the
brief,
it
says
the
--
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
attorney
general,
who
is
authorized
to
promulgate
a
workmen’s
compensation
statute.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
there
is
certainly
positive
language
on
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
that
will
be
paid.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes.
but
i
think,
however,
it’s
fair
to
state
whether
it
was
amended
that
congress
certainly
assumed
that
a
--
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
he
puts
a
regular
emphasis
on
it
but
i
would
emphasize
this
in
answer,
the
act
was
original
statute.
it
passed
in
1932
and
the
regulations
promulgated
there
under
and
immediately
made
on
a
water
compensation
mandatory.
as
any
prisoner
who
was
injured
inside
the
compensation
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
i
really
don’t
think
the
answer
that
it
should
affect
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
scheme
where
in
fact
there
isn’t
award
made
and
the
substantial
award
made.
i
think
if
you
had
a
problem
with
the
attorney
general,
we’re
going
to
say
this
prisoner
is
going
to
get
an
award
of
that
prisoner’s
not
getting
an
award.
that
might
be
such
a
system.
but
the
only
discretion
here
is
leaving
the
detail
of
the
implementation
of
the
system
to
the
attorney
general.
congress
assumes
such
a
system
would
be
put
in
order
as
it
was
put
into
effect
more
than
30
years
ago
and
has
been
maintained
in
effect.
the
people
administering
the
system
under
the
regulations
have
no
discretion.
in
other
words,
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
an
award
under
the
regulations
and
always
has
that.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
with
or
without
fault;
that’s
on
ordinary
workmen’s
compensation
system.
it
was
no
question,
for
example,
when
this
man
in
essence
--
what
essence
happened
to
that
particular
respondent
if
he
alleged
in
his
tort
should
we
fail
to
provide
him
with
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
we
raise
no
defenses
in
the
compensation
award.
we
agreed
he
was
entitled
to
it.
we
didn’t
suggest
that
we
had
or
we
hadn’t.
there
was
just
an
industrial
accident.
this
is
a
sort
of
accident
and
that
the
scheme
covered
this
sort
of
accident
and
it
happens
in
any
sort
of
work
conditions.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
actually,
well,
i’m
going
to
give
you
a
specific
example.
had
respondent
been
engaged
in
this
–
he
was
a
carpenter
–
had
he
been
engaged
in
doing
the
same
sort
of
work,
that
is
putting
windows
in
a
private
dwelling
for
his
private
employer
in
his
home
state
in
pennsylvania,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
award,
indeed
he
would
be
even
restricted
to
an
award
of
compensation
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
he
would,
under
the
compensation
of
laws
in
pennsylvania,
it
would
have
been
less
than
he
is
actually
getting
now
from
federal
government.
it’s
also
clear
on
the
pennsylvania
law,
we’ve
cited
that
on
our
brief,
that
he
couldn’t
sue
his
employer
under
the
pennsylvania
law.
he
couldn’t
saw
her
for
tort,
recovery
of
tort.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
happen
in
most
state.
the
award
that
prisoner
getting
in
this
circumstance
was
substantially
less
than
he
would
get
under
the
prisoner’s
compensation
system.
the
long
sherman’s
act,
for
example,
provides
a
maximum
recovery
for
the
defendant
upon
salary
of
approximately
$70
a
week
which
compares
something
quite
reasonable
to
the
award
being
given
to
the
prisoner.
i
might
add,
of
course,
that
like
all
compensation
system,
if
the
illegibility
for
an
award
to
preclude
suit
against
the
prisoner,
there’s
no
problem
here.
we
could
prove
that
third
person
was
negligent.
he
was
certainly
be
free
to
sue
third-person
account
in
tort.
all
for
that
matter,
if
the
government
came
in
and
said,
“you
weren’t
injured”
or
someone
has
found
you
weren’t
injured
in
circumstances,
we
aren’t
entitled
to
compensation;
that
if
you
are
not
covered
by
the
system,
then
of
course
again,
he
could
sue.
indeed,
i
would
point
out
that
the
decision
below
is
quite
unique.
but
as
far
as
we
know,
there
is
no
compensation
system
anywhere
in
the
united
states
where
an
employee
is
given
the
right
both
to
attain
his
compensation
recovery
which
is
they
say
again
is
paid
without
regard
to
fault
and
without
regard
to
contributory
negligence
and
without
regard
to
the
other
delays
and
tort
litigations
that
always
go
on
and
it
sometimes
may
be
done
by
just
settlement.
and
also,
while
retaining
in
one
hand
that
absolute
right
to
recovery,
suing
his
employer,
there
may
be
nothing
on
to
award
about
this
system
but
allowing
both
recoveries.
but
i
would
think
that
if
congress
weren’t
had
intended
to
do
that,
it
would’ve
said
so
quite
clearly
that
surely
there
was
some
indication
of
it.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
oh,
no,
no,
the
point
i
was
making
at
is
that
we
know
of
no
system
generally.
there
was
certainly
no
federal
system
where
he
is
entitled
to
a
compensation
award
and
also
to
try
as
hand
to
the
suit
in
tort
to
see
if
he
could
do
better.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
that’s
the
problem,
of
course.
it
is
employment
and
there
would
be
employment
if
we
were
employed
for
federal
prison
industries
end.
that’s
certainly
a
clear
employment.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no.
this
system
is
not
substantially
different
from
that
other
than
the
fact
that
the
prisoners
being
required
to
do
--
maintenance
work,
training
work
and
i
allow
it
as
it
must
be
passed
away.
this
is
not
a
network
system;
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
covers
system
where
man
is
making
little
ones
out
of
the
big
ones
out
in
the
field.
he
is
in
fact
engaged
in
putting
in
a
plate
glass
window
that
blown
out
the
louisburg
broiler
plant.
other
prisoners
are
engaged
in
helping
maintain
and
operate
the
prison.
it’s
a
highly
desirable
program.
after
all,
one
of
the
purposes
of
putting
the
man
in
prison,
in
addition
to
keeping
him
away
from
anyone
else,
is
to
get
amused
and
help
to
working
and
to
doing
responsible
jobs
and
working
with
other
people.
this
is
not
substantially
different
from
an
ordinary
employment
system.
there’s
nothing
in
the
way
the
prisoners
would
being
work.
that
would
make
that
so
any
difference.
i
might
go
on
to
the
point
out
that
it’s
true
as
my
opponent
relies
on
heavily
as
the
court
below
relied
on
that
the
prisoner
compensation
statute
itself
does
not
say
it
exclusively.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
does
not
say,
in
so
many
words
and
it
is
to
be
in
exclusive
remedy.
we’ve
pointed
out
that
this
court
has
faced
that
problem
on
at
least
two
occasions
regarding
federal
seamen.
if
you
recall
yohansen
and
patterson
cases
which
came
up
in
the
circumstances
of
federal
seamen
who
were
employed
on
federal
owned
vessels.
at
the
time
of
question
seamen
rangered
in
the
course
of
their
work,
and
they
were
entitled
to
an
award
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
at
that
time,
the
compensation
act
did
not
say
it
was
an
exclusively
remedy.
moreover,
to
this
day,
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
does
not
say
in
it’s
an
exclusive
remedy
for
seamen.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
it
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
it
looked
to
the
background
of
what
the
congress
had
intended
to
do.
and
so
no
indication
that
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
public
vessels
act
to
have
substantive
of
the
act
which
indicated
any
congressional
intend
to
give
additional
benefits
to
those
who
already
had
some.
the
court
said
it
was
understandable
that
congress
didn’t
make
the
employees
compensation
system
in
exclusive
one
in
so
many
words
because
at
the
time
it
was
passed,
there
wasn’t
any
other
remedy
for
federal
employees
against
the
united
states
and
it
was
necessarily
the
exclusive
and
only
remedy.
the
same
is
true
with
the
prisoner
compensation
statute.
it
was
passed
in
1934,
some
12
years
before
the
tort
claims
act.
when
it
was
passed,
it
was
the
only
remedy
that
any
prisoner
had.
it’s
true
that
the
tort
claims
act
is
passed
in
1946
and
that
under
this
court
decision
in
muniz
the
prisoner
could
then
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act.
however,
when
the
prisoner
compensation
system
was
expanded
in
1961
to
cover
all
working
prisoners,
it
was
done
so
at
the
urging
of
the
attorney
general
once
again,
i
mean
far
from
the
attorney
general
not
one
any
ground
it
was,
the
attorney
general
was
looking
for
way
to
pay
these
prisoners
who
were
injured
and
he
pointed
out
correctly
that
it
doesn’t
allow
federal
courts
at
all
held
that
federal
prisoners
had
no
remedy
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
at
least
one
of
those
cases
of
certiorari
had
been
denied.
in
these
circumstances,
he
went
to
congress
and
asked
for
the
expansion
of
the
prison
industries
remedy
to
cover
all
working
prisoners
to
give
them
equal
treatment.
and
the
committee
report
which
we’ve
cited,
the
only
one
which
is
very
important
to
page
21
on
our
brief,
pre-states
what
the
congress
and
the
committee
thought.
let
me
quote,
“presently,
there’s
no
way
on
the
general
law
to
compensate
prisoners
injured
while
so
engaged”
–
that
is
engaged
in
operation/maintenance
work
like
respondent.
their
only
recourse
has
been
to
appeal
to
congress.
and
this
committee
has
reported
number
of
private
bills
in
the
relief
of
such
prisoners.
in
short,
when
congress
expanded
the
statute,
the
coverage
to
include,
contains
the
provision
or
continued
the
provision
that
in
no
event
shall
recover
exceed
that
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
surely,
indication
that
it
did
not
intend
to
treat
this
compensation
system
any
differently
than
he
treated
any
other
one.
now
in
united
states
against
muniz
which
is
the
other
case,
which
my
opponent
here
relies
on
very
heavily,
this
court
considered
whether
a
prisoner
could
sue
under
the
federal
claims
act
and
held
unanimously
that
he
certainly
could.
and
the
opinion
contains
language
to
the
effect
that
the
presence
of
a
compensation
system
does
not
necessarily
preclude
the
suit
in
tort.
but
we
think,
and
i
think
we
noted
in
the
second
circuit
whose
decision
this
court
affirmed
and
unanimously
agrees
with
us
because
as
you
know,
the
second
circuit
was
exactly
the
opposite
result
of
the
court
here,
the
third
circuit
did
in
this
case
and
we
think
that
language
as
we
understood
in
consideration
with
the
argument
which
the
argument
was
then
advancing.
the
government
suggested
that
congress
had
provided
a
remedy
in
small
area
for
some
prisoners
and
this
indicated
the
congressional
intent
never
if
not
to
provide
any
other
remedy
for
any
other
prisoners.
that
was
the
argument
which
this
court
rejected.
but
the
court
didn’t
consider
whether
the
fact
that
prisoner
had
a
compensation
remedy
and
was
in
fact
being
paid,
would
preclude
them
from
bringing
suit.
indeed,
the
court
didn’t
mention
patterson,
which
is
the
seamen
in
this
case,
and
then
decided
only
a
few
terms
or
earlier,
and
mentions
yohansen
only
on
the
footnote
in
passing.
i
think
that
the
decision
in
muniz
doesn’t
imply
that
one
who
has
got
an
adequate,
simple,
certain
remedy
is
also
entitled
to
sue
united
states
in
tort
in
addition
to
that
remedy.
i’m
not
saying
of
anything
wrong
of
that,
your
honor.
it’s
just
that
it’s
unusual
and
it
would
be
odd
of
the
ordinary
and
one
would
expect
congress
so
said
something
like
that
and
if
you
particularly
wanted
to
do
so.
i
might
add
that
once
again
that
no
employee
of
the
federal
government
at
all.
any
branch
of
the
government,
civilian
or
military
has
this
right
for
injuries
incurred
there
in
the
course
of
work.
and
indeed,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
uniform
general
rule
in
workmen’s
compensation
act
is
that
what
was
covered
by
the
injury
can
only
sue
to
make
third
parties
or
someone,
some
person
other
than
his
employer.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
indeed
it
would
not.
muniz
himself
was
injured
on
the
course
of
practices.
you
pinned
him
to
private
medicate.
henry
winston,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
a
medical
malpractice
matter.
and
more
than
that,
the
three
cases
which
service
granted
was
in
conflict,
none
of
those
prisoners
could
have
recovered
under
the
compensation
act
either.
i
might
add
that
in
this
regard,
that
the
prisoners
compensation
statute
is
probably
consistent
with
all
workmen’s
compensation
matters.
for
example,
if
you
are
injured
by
you
are
employer
when
you’re
not
working,
then
you’re
free
to
sue
your
employer
in
tort
and
you
are
also
not
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation.
that’s
precisely
what
would
happen
on
the
circumstances
here.
if
this
fellowmen
had
been
injured
to
the
full
negligence
of
the
government
at
the
time
when
it
wasn’t
part
of
his
employment,
it
wasn’t
a
risk
of
employment
which
is
protected,
then
he
would
be
entitled
suit
just
as
mr.
muniz
was.
but
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
the
rule
saying
he
can’t
sue
when
he’s
already
been
given
another
remedy.
i
might
add,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
the
remedy
is
fully
comparable,
we
thought,
to
any
other
workmen’s
compensation
remedies.
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
as
generous
as
given
to
full
time
federal
employees
selected
at
least
supposedly
for
that,
in
the
merit.
but
nonetheless,
it’s
not
inadequate
and
it’s
certainly
matches
the
level
of
those
keeping
the
ground
level,
threshold
level
given
to
federal
employees.
the
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
certainly,
your
honor.
some
of
them,
i’m
afraid,
are
inaccurate
and
some
of
them
are
irrelevant
and
some
of
them
i
think
should
not
make
any
difference
at
all.
as
we
pointed
out
earlier,
it’s
mandatory
how
big
it
by
regulation
of
the
attorney
general
in
force
for
some
35
years
rather
than
expressly
by
statute
of
congress.
but
the
second
one,
the
amount,
if
they
would
arrest
entirely
was
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
is
only
theoretical
problem.
in
essence,
the
attorney
general
has
set
the
regulation
set
that
the
certain
scale
to
be
followed
and
it’s
followed
in
every
case.
it’s
not
very
comprehensible
to
prisoner.
all
they
really
means
is
that
these
details
of
the
compensation
system
has
spelled
out
by
regulation
rather
by
statute.
i
might
add,
do
we
have
this
problem
or
the
problem
came
up
in
the
context
of
persons
who
were
employed
by
nonappropriated
fund
instrumentality
to
the
military
service.
in
short,
the
officers
message
which
were
run,
justice
fortas,
out
of
the
fund
they
take
in
rather
in
treasury
appropriation.
and
the
congress
there
passed
the
statute
which
said
that
those
employees
shall
be
given/provided
workmen’s
compensation
and
left
all
the
details
up
to
the
people
administering
it.
they
simply
went
out
and
got
the
usual
workmen’s
compensation
policy
that
anyone
else
could
have
done.
every
court
of
appeal,
which
has
considered
it,
had
held
that
that
was
exclusive
to
the
policy
they
have.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
i
think
two.
first,
i
don’t
have
to
assume
that
this
should
but
it
isn’t.
and
secondly,
i
thought
–-
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no,
sir.
the
regulations
provide,
for
example,
that
one
may
file
a
claim
for
compensation
but
within
a
year
after
release
from
prison,
as
it
is
you
file
normally
with
file
it
and
upon
release
and
examined
by
prisoner’s
physician
who
have
doctors
there.
if
you
are
not
satisfied,
that’s
what
you
get.
you
can
file
another
claim
upon
release.
indeed
i
think
the
second
circuit
noted
that
in
another
decision.
and
you
can
accompany
that
second
circuit
to
your
claim
with
the
report
of
your
present
physician
and
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
after
he
left
prison.
and
that’s
something
inaccurate,
sir.
in
this
case,
of
course,
he
was
given
the
full
award
before
he
left
prison.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
i
would
certainly
not
deny
that
there
is
a
difference
in
this
case
of
prisoners
between
the
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
only
on
the
sense
that,
at
the
regulation
as
i’ve
told
actually
quite
only
if
he’s
put
back
on
jail
and
not
entirely
correct
even
in
that
case,
your
honor.
the
circumstances
of
this,
the
compensation
is
understood
to
be
in
lieu
of
the
lost
earning
power
that
he
got
because
he
could
no
longer
work.
if
he’s
reconfined
that
there
he
was,
that
then
he’s
no
longer
lost
any
earning
power
and
they
could
cut
off
the
compensation.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
so
long
advised.
moreover,
if
he
has
dependents,
he
can
continue
repay
to
dependents
while
he
has
been
reconfined.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
the
answer
to
that
case,
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstance.
if
the
award
were
made
to
dependents,
they
would
get
it.
the
difficulty
with
the
problem,
i
would
say,
your
honor
is
that
there
haven’t
been
any
cases
that
i
come
across
that
we
know
of
–-
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
your
honor,
let
me
put
in
this
circumstances.
federal
employees
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
have
no
right
to
judicial
review
of
the
actions
of
the
board
giving
or
withholding
compensation
either.
and
to
that
extent,
certainly,
there
is
a
problem
of
whether
this
thing
is
the
administrate
problem.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no,
your
honor,
he
will
not.
but
cert—
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
true.
but
let
me
point
out
once
again,
your
honor,
we
just
don’t
think
that
is
relevant
to
this
particular
problem.
if
compensation
is
understood
to
be
a
substitution
for
the
wages
you
cannot
earn,
it’s
quite
clear
that
if
you
put
back
in
the
federal
prison
where
he
is
provided
with
food,
clothing
and
shelter,
the
problem
of
the
wages
you
cannot
earn
will
be
obviated.
if
for
example,
he
went
on
private
employment
and
then
he
would
be
put
back
in
jail,
his
private
way
would
cease
immediately.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
in
that
particular
circumstances,
i
think
that
mr.
demko
is
injured
and
the
federal
preclude
him
from
breaking
the
county
since
he
broke
his
leg
and
he
couldn’t
get
away.
but
in
any
event,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
never
deny
that
this
particular
scheme
thus
is
tearing
to
certain
degree
to
prisoners
and
that’s
necessarily.
the
question
is
whether
that
should
mean
any
less
comprehensive
remedy
or
not
i
think
that
doesn’t
make
it
single
difference.
i
don’t
think
we
should
turn
on
that
point,
your
honor.
he
would
not
loss
any
earning
power
or
any
wage
earning
capacity
if
you
will
reconfine.
i’ve
covered,
your
honor,
and
if
you
don’t
have
any
further
questions,
and
all
the
points
that
i’ve
intended
to
make
in
my
opening
argument.
i
would
like
to
save
for
a
moment
for
rebuttal
if
i
have
it.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
i
have
in
answering
the
questions
proposed
by
justice,
just
a
few
words
in
closure.
and,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i’ve
had
the
opportunity
to
check
with
the
federal
prisoner
official
who
are
in
the
courtroom
and
they
say
that
“yes,
the
compensation
is
resumed
upon
whether
the
prisoner
is
released
from
confinement”.
secondly,
regarding
the
letter
which
were
sent
to
all
the
justices
and
our
opposing
counsel,
the
letter
is
quite
accurate
by
both
by
practice
and
regulation.
total
disability
payments
are
geared
to
the
minimum
payments
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
that
was
set
out
in
specific
sum
of
a
$180
a
month
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
until
this
summer.
this
summer,
completely
independent
to
this
proceedings,
congress
raised
to
pay
the
minimum
award
of
$245
a
month
for
all
prisoners
who
were
totally
disabled
not
merely
mr.
demko,
who
received
a
prison
award.
regarding
the
other
amounts,
the
award
for
other
benefits,
it
is
a
schedule
of
benefits.
in
practice
and
under
the
regulations,
they
follow
the
schedule
of
benefit
set
out
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
which
is
normally
set
out
for
the
loss
of
a
particular
member;
so
many
weeks
of
compensation
and
so
forth.
and
they
used
to
compute
the
amount
of
compensation,
the
matter
was
in
tucked
to
which
the
prisoner
is
entitled
the
minimum
wage
that
an
employee
would
be
entitled
to
receive,
any
federal
employee
in
the
united
states
minimum
wage.
that’s
set
out
in
the
regulation
too.
if
you’d
like
further
details,
i
would
be
glad
to
send
an
additional
letter
to
the
court.
i
might
add
that
the
figures
$50
and
$4,000
relating
to
loss
of
finger
and
the
death
come
from
a
letter
which
among
other
things
is
12
years
old.
on
top
of
that,
the
$50
for
a
loss
of
a
finger
probably
was
$50
for
loss
of
a
tip
of
an
index
finger.
if
you
look
at
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
it
has
a
different
monetary
amount
for
any
particular
joint
or
body
loss.
the
death
of
one,
of
course,
it
would
be
determined
of
how
old
the
prisoner
was
and
how
much
time
it
was
like
much
longer
his
life
would
live.
naturally,
$4,000
it
would
for
an
older
man
would
be
unjust.
if
i
may
answer,
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
i
think
mr.
justice
blacks
question
too
about
two
remedies.
the
answer
is,
yes,
that’s
exactly
what
will
be
the
case
here.
we
agree
and
indeed
we
insist,
because
we
insist
there’s
no
tort
remedy
that
this
prisoner
is
entitled
to
compensation
if
he
was
injured
in
the
cause
of
his
work.
and
whether
he
win
or
loss
the
tort
suit,
he
would
get
the
compensation
and
that’s,
of
course,
why
the
government
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
right.
yes,
sir.
if
he’s
injured
in
the
course
of
work,
but
let
me
get
one
other
point
clear.
we’ve
had
a
lot
of
discussion
about,
on
my
recount,
about
the
comprehensiveness
of
remedy.
well,
i
think
the
accurate
is
remedy
is
comprehensive
in
the
same
sense
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
is
comprehensive
in
the
same
sense
that
every
compensation
statute
is
comprehensive.
if
a
man
is
injured
while
working,
he
gets
compensation
benefits.
if
he’s
injured
when
his
not
working
even
because
he
is
bitten
up
by
a
fellow
prisoner
for
negligence,
or
for
that
matter
runover
by
unrelated
truck,
a
government
vehicle,
then
he
can
sue
as
for
tort.
that’s
precisely
mr.
muniz’
situation.
indeed,
there
are
cases,
i
think
with
the
recent
case
the
tenth
circuit
called
browning
v.
united
states,
in
which
the
precisely
that
matter
came
up.
the
federal
employee
was
rundown
by
a
federal
truck
and
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
he
wasn’t
working.
consequently,
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
compensation.
he
gets
the
federal
employees
remedy.
i
might
add
that
the
remedy
as
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out,
is
not
insubstantial.
in
this
particular
case,
$75,000,
i
think
this
is
reasonable
minimum
amount
which
is
to
be
expected
receive
less,
of
course,
because
he
has
a
sudden
accidental
death
earlier.
that
would
be
paid,
of
course,
over
the
years.
moreover,
that’s
something
like
three
times
the
amount
which
the
defendants
would
receive
in
the
perez
cases,
which
this
court
pointed
out
it
was
not
an
insubstantial
amount.
i
might
add
that
in
the
army
cases
to
which
my
brother
makes
reference
here,
it’s
quite
clear
that
no
soldier
was
injured
incident
to
service
pursuant
to
the
tort
claims
act.
the
brown
case
and
the
brooks
case
upon
which
he
cites,
but
times
when
the
soldiers
run
further,
they
weren’t
working
and
they
held
that
they
could
sue
despite
the
benefits.
we
agree
that
in
circumstances
where
the
man
is
not
working,
he
is
entitled
to
sue.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
i
am,
mr.
douglas
that
they
didn’t’
come
up.
i
would
assume
the
answer
that
that
would
be
yes.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
if
they
are
covered
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
and
i
can’t
give
you
the
answer
to
that,
the
answer
is
they
would
be
covered
under
the
statute
because
the
people
of
the
muniz
statute
followed
the
same
standard
in
the
same
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
exactly
true.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
right.
i
have
presumed
the
assumption
would
be
that
a
prisoner
who
is
not
working,
not
to
be
released,
is
not
supporting
as
defendants.
on
the
other
hand,
a
prisoner
who
dies
in
prison
out
of
accident
might
proceed
and
the
future
be
released
next
day
to
pardon
to
anything.
consequently,
it’s
not
worries
immediately
to
the
widow.
i’d
like
to
add
in
closing
that
we
don’t
think
that
this
statute
is
in
anyway
in
conflict
with
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
indeed,
with
the
express
language
of
it.
i’d
like
to
point
out
again
that
as
i
closed,
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
imposed
by
that
act
was
to
be,
and
i
quote
from
28
usc
2674,
“imposed
on
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
in
like
circumstances”.
i
have
read
nothing
in
respondent’s
brief
and
i
heard
nothing
here
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
to
suggest
that
in
like
circumstances
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
private
employer
would
recover.
and
moreover,
private
employer-employee
would
not
be
able
to
recover
in
tort
as
private
employee
where
he
was
getting
compensation
remedy
in
pennsylvania
or
for
that
matter
in
any
of
the
50
states
of
this
columbia.
consequently,
we
think
that
the
interpretation
we
put
on
the
prisoner
compensation
system.
it
may
fairly
comports
with
the
act
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
your
honor,
let
me
read
20
of
the
pre-regulations
entering
code.
these
are
the
regulations,
of
course,
promulgated
through
under
the
section
of
the
attorney
general.
nobody
in
the
federal
prison
industry
can
change
them.
section
28
cfr
section
301.2,
“accident
compensation
will
be
paid
to
such
injured
inmates
as
our
totally
or
partially
disabled”
and
it
goes
on
to
say
when.
i
guess
no
question
on
that,
your
honor.
if
i
have
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
commence
this
suit
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act
to
recover
for
injuries
he
incurred
in
the
cause
of
work
he
was
performing
while
a
federal
prisoner
in
the
federal
penitentiary
of
louisburg,
pennsylvania.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute
for
purposes
of
this
hearing.
in
private
life,
respondent
had
employed
upon
occasions
as
a
carpenter.
while
imprisoned
he
was
assigned
to
do
maintenance
work.
in
the
course
of
replacing
a
broken
window
some
height
above
the
floor,
he
lost
his
balance,
fell
and
was
severely
injured.
as
a
result
of
that
injury,
he
applied
for
an
award
of
workmen’s
compensation.
under
the
prisoners
compensation
statute,
18
usc
4126,
he
was
awarded
such
compensation
in
the
sum
of
$180
a
month.
but
as
a
result,
this
summer
of
congress
raising
generally,
the
labels
of
workmen’s
compensation
paid
throughout
the
united
states
to
all
non-government
employees.
he
is
now
receiving
$245
a
month
in
compensation
from
the
united
states
for
the
injury
he
received
in
the
course
of
his
prison
work.
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
that
prisoner
compensation
remedy
is
like
all
other
workmen’s
compensation
remedies
provided
for
any
employee
or
anyone
working
for
the
united
states,
an
exclusive
one
and
therefore
precludes
this
suit
under
the
tort
claims
act
based
on
those
very
same
injuries.
or
stated
the
other
way,
whether
congress
intended
the
prisoner
compensation
remedy
to
be
different
from
the
compensation
remedies
provided
for
every
other
soldier
or
civilian
employee
of
the
government
or
any
federal
employee
of
any
branch
with
the
government
and
that
the
prisoner
was
not
only
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation
without
regard
to
fault.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes,
your
honor,
the
regulations
on
the
statute
provide
that,
it’s
on
28
cfr
31.2,
it
provides
that
anyone
who
is
injured
will
be
granted
an
award
of
compensation,
medical
benefits
and
the
like.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
the
answer,
yes.
the
compensation
is
actually
paid
when
he
leaves
the
prison
the
theory
being
that
compensation
is
to
replace
lost
earning
power
and
he
had
been
earning.
but
that’s
not
entirely
accurate,
sir.
if
the
prisoner
was
employed
in
prison
industries
where
he
did
get
a
salary,
then
he
does
continue
to
receive
his
pay
while
in
prison
even
though
he
can’t
work
for
prison
industries.
industry
is
a
job
to
the
apprentice
program,
contain
a
small
stipend
and
the
prisoner
may
earn
several
hundred
dollars
a
year.
he
continued
to
get
that.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
the
compensation
schedule
follows
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
that
is
the
administrators
had
interpreted
as
meaning
that
for
total
disability,
a
prisoner
who
will
receive
the
minimum
award
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
on
a
theory
that
the
prisoner
compensation
statute
says,
in
no
event
shall
compensation
under
that
statute
exceed
would
be
given
to
federal
employee.
that’s
$245
a
month.
there
is
a
schedule
of
benefits
paid
in
a
measure
of
the
minimum
wage.
whatever
the
federal
minimum
wage
is,
it’s
determined
as
to
what
the
prisoner’s
earning
power,
it’s
a
purposes
of
paying
benefits.
indeed,
this
is
also
payments
paid
for
lost
of
a
member
for
example.
off
hand,
i
would
assume
that
the
prisoner
would
loss
the
hand.
i
asked
the
prisoner
to
calculate
that
and
receive
about
$8,000
in
cash
award,
probably
not
in
a
lump
sum
benefit
as
a
matter
of
a
practice
plus
any
disability
benefits
he
would
result
from
it.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
as
far
as
i
can
see,
yes,
your
honor,
is
and
it
can
par
with
federal
employees.
it’s
applied
without
regard
to
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
or
fault
on
the
part
of
the
government.
indeed,
in
many
circumstances,
the
prisoners
who
were
employed
in
jobs
where
they’re
working
alongside
federal
employees.
for
example,
in
some
say,
a
prisoner
is
used
to
help
collect
trash
and
garbage
and
part
of
the
crew
is
made
up
of
ordinary
federal
employees
-
gs
1,
gs
2
employees
–
and
when
did
we
have
a
case
where
prisoner’s
injured
when
he
fell
of
the
truck.
and
we
would
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
compensation,
if
he
is
totally
disabled.
if
the
employee
had
fallen
off
the
truck,
it’s
quite
clear
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
compensation
and
would
not
be
entitled
to
sue
in
court.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
not
really,
your
honor.
the
act
itself,
that
is
the
compensation
act
that
was
passed,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
1932
originally
when
there
is
no
recovery
against
the
united
states
at
all
and
no
tort
claims
act.
it’s
passed
the
attorney
general’s
urging
to
provide
protection
for
prisoners
working
in
prison
industries
and
the
act,
it
says,
“compensation
may
be
paid
out
of
the
prison
industries
fund”
--
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
i
can
say
the
actual
lines
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
the
brief,
it
says
the
--
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
attorney
general,
who
is
authorized
to
promulgate
a
workmen’s
compensation
statute.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
there
is
certainly
positive
language
on
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
that
will
be
paid.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes.
but
i
think,
however,
it’s
fair
to
state
whether
it
was
amended
that
congress
certainly
assumed
that
a
--
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
he
puts
a
regular
emphasis
on
it
but
i
would
emphasize
this
in
answer,
the
act
was
original
statute.
it
passed
in
1932
and
the
regulations
promulgated
there
under
and
immediately
made
on
a
water
compensation
mandatory.
as
any
prisoner
who
was
injured
inside
the
compensation
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
i
really
don’t
think
the
answer
that
it
should
affect
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
scheme
where
in
fact
there
isn’t
award
made
and
the
substantial
award
made.
i
think
if
you
had
a
problem
with
the
attorney
general,
we’re
going
to
say
this
prisoner
is
going
to
get
an
award
of
that
prisoner’s
not
getting
an
award.
that
might
be
such
a
system.
but
the
only
discretion
here
is
leaving
the
detail
of
the
implementation
of
the
system
to
the
attorney
general.
congress
assumes
such
a
system
would
be
put
in
order
as
it
was
put
into
effect
more
than
30
years
ago
and
has
been
maintained
in
effect.
the
people
administering
the
system
under
the
regulations
have
no
discretion.
in
other
words,
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
an
award
under
the
regulations
and
always
has
that.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
with
or
without
fault;
that’s
on
ordinary
workmen’s
compensation
system.
it
was
no
question,
for
example,
when
this
man
in
essence
--
what
essence
happened
to
that
particular
respondent
if
he
alleged
in
his
tort
should
we
fail
to
provide
him
with
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
we
raise
no
defenses
in
the
compensation
award.
we
agreed
he
was
entitled
to
it.
we
didn’t
suggest
that
we
had
or
we
hadn’t.
there
was
just
an
industrial
accident.
this
is
a
sort
of
accident
and
that
the
scheme
covered
this
sort
of
accident
and
it
happens
in
any
sort
of
work
conditions.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
actually,
well,
i’m
going
to
give
you
a
specific
example.
had
respondent
been
engaged
in
this
–
he
was
a
carpenter
–
had
he
been
engaged
in
doing
the
same
sort
of
work,
that
is
putting
windows
in
a
private
dwelling
for
his
private
employer
in
his
home
state
in
pennsylvania,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
award,
indeed
he
would
be
even
restricted
to
an
award
of
compensation
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
he
would,
under
the
compensation
of
laws
in
pennsylvania,
it
would
have
been
less
than
he
is
actually
getting
now
from
federal
government.
it’s
also
clear
on
the
pennsylvania
law,
we’ve
cited
that
on
our
brief,
that
he
couldn’t
sue
his
employer
under
the
pennsylvania
law.
he
couldn’t
saw
her
for
tort,
recovery
of
tort.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
happen
in
most
state.
the
award
that
prisoner
getting
in
this
circumstance
was
substantially
less
than
he
would
get
under
the
prisoner’s
compensation
system.
the
long
sherman’s
act,
for
example,
provides
a
maximum
recovery
for
the
defendant
upon
salary
of
approximately
$70
a
week
which
compares
something
quite
reasonable
to
the
award
being
given
to
the
prisoner.
i
might
add,
of
course,
that
like
all
compensation
system,
if
the
illegibility
for
an
award
to
preclude
suit
against
the
prisoner,
there’s
no
problem
here.
we
could
prove
that
third
person
was
negligent.
he
was
certainly
be
free
to
sue
third-person
account
in
tort.
all
for
that
matter,
if
the
government
came
in
and
said,
“you
weren’t
injured”
or
someone
has
found
you
weren’t
injured
in
circumstances,
we
aren’t
entitled
to
compensation;
that
if
you
are
not
covered
by
the
system,
then
of
course
again,
he
could
sue.
indeed,
i
would
point
out
that
the
decision
below
is
quite
unique.
but
as
far
as
we
know,
there
is
no
compensation
system
anywhere
in
the
united
states
where
an
employee
is
given
the
right
both
to
attain
his
compensation
recovery
which
is
they
say
again
is
paid
without
regard
to
fault
and
without
regard
to
contributory
negligence
and
without
regard
to
the
other
delays
and
tort
litigations
that
always
go
on
and
it
sometimes
may
be
done
by
just
settlement.
and
also,
while
retaining
in
one
hand
that
absolute
right
to
recovery,
suing
his
employer,
there
may
be
nothing
on
to
award
about
this
system
but
allowing
both
recoveries.
but
i
would
think
that
if
congress
weren’t
had
intended
to
do
that,
it
would’ve
said
so
quite
clearly
that
surely
there
was
some
indication
of
it.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
oh,
no,
no,
the
point
i
was
making
at
is
that
we
know
of
no
system
generally.
there
was
certainly
no
federal
system
where
he
is
entitled
to
a
compensation
award
and
also
to
try
as
hand
to
the
suit
in
tort
to
see
if
he
could
do
better.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
that’s
the
problem,
of
course.
it
is
employment
and
there
would
be
employment
if
we
were
employed
for
federal
prison
industries
end.
that’s
certainly
a
clear
employment.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no.
this
system
is
not
substantially
different
from
that
other
than
the
fact
that
the
prisoners
being
required
to
do
--
maintenance
work,
training
work
and
i
allow
it
as
it
must
be
passed
away.
this
is
not
a
network
system;
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
covers
system
where
man
is
making
little
ones
out
of
the
big
ones
out
in
the
field.
he
is
in
fact
engaged
in
putting
in
a
plate
glass
window
that
blown
out
the
louisburg
broiler
plant.
other
prisoners
are
engaged
in
helping
maintain
and
operate
the
prison.
it’s
a
highly
desirable
program.
after
all,
one
of
the
purposes
of
putting
the
man
in
prison,
in
addition
to
keeping
him
away
from
anyone
else,
is
to
get
amused
and
help
to
working
and
to
doing
responsible
jobs
and
working
with
other
people.
this
is
not
substantially
different
from
an
ordinary
employment
system.
there’s
nothing
in
the
way
the
prisoners
would
being
work.
that
would
make
that
so
any
difference.
i
might
go
on
to
the
point
out
that
it’s
true
as
my
opponent
relies
on
heavily
as
the
court
below
relied
on
that
the
prisoner
compensation
statute
itself
does
not
say
it
exclusively.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
does
not
say,
in
so
many
words
and
it
is
to
be
in
exclusive
remedy.
we’ve
pointed
out
that
this
court
has
faced
that
problem
on
at
least
two
occasions
regarding
federal
seamen.
if
you
recall
yohansen
and
patterson
cases
which
came
up
in
the
circumstances
of
federal
seamen
who
were
employed
on
federal
owned
vessels.
at
the
time
of
question
seamen
rangered
in
the
course
of
their
work,
and
they
were
entitled
to
an
award
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
at
that
time,
the
compensation
act
did
not
say
it
was
an
exclusively
remedy.
moreover,
to
this
day,
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
does
not
say
in
it’s
an
exclusive
remedy
for
seamen.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
it
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
it
looked
to
the
background
of
what
the
congress
had
intended
to
do.
and
so
no
indication
that
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
public
vessels
act
to
have
substantive
of
the
act
which
indicated
any
congressional
intend
to
give
additional
benefits
to
those
who
already
had
some.
the
court
said
it
was
understandable
that
congress
didn’t
make
the
employees
compensation
system
in
exclusive
one
in
so
many
words
because
at
the
time
it
was
passed,
there
wasn’t
any
other
remedy
for
federal
employees
against
the
united
states
and
it
was
necessarily
the
exclusive
and
only
remedy.
the
same
is
true
with
the
prisoner
compensation
statute.
it
was
passed
in
1934,
some
12
years
before
the
tort
claims
act.
when
it
was
passed,
it
was
the
only
remedy
that
any
prisoner
had.
it’s
true
that
the
tort
claims
act
is
passed
in
1946
and
that
under
this
court
decision
in
muniz
the
prisoner
could
then
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act.
however,
when
the
prisoner
compensation
system
was
expanded
in
1961
to
cover
all
working
prisoners,
it
was
done
so
at
the
urging
of
the
attorney
general
once
again,
i
mean
far
from
the
attorney
general
not
one
any
ground
it
was,
the
attorney
general
was
looking
for
way
to
pay
these
prisoners
who
were
injured
and
he
pointed
out
correctly
that
it
doesn’t
allow
federal
courts
at
all
held
that
federal
prisoners
had
no
remedy
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
at
least
one
of
those
cases
of
certiorari
had
been
denied.
in
these
circumstances,
he
went
to
congress
and
asked
for
the
expansion
of
the
prison
industries
remedy
to
cover
all
working
prisoners
to
give
them
equal
treatment.
and
the
committee
report
which
we’ve
cited,
the
only
one
which
is
very
important
to
page
21
on
our
brief,
pre-states
what
the
congress
and
the
committee
thought.
let
me
quote,
“presently,
there’s
no
way
on
the
general
law
to
compensate
prisoners
injured
while
so
engaged”
–
that
is
engaged
in
operation/maintenance
work
like
respondent.
their
only
recourse
has
been
to
appeal
to
congress.
and
this
committee
has
reported
number
of
private
bills
in
the
relief
of
such
prisoners.
in
short,
when
congress
expanded
the
statute,
the
coverage
to
include,
contains
the
provision
or
continued
the
provision
that
in
no
event
shall
recover
exceed
that
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
surely,
indication
that
it
did
not
intend
to
treat
this
compensation
system
any
differently
than
he
treated
any
other
one.
now
in
united
states
against
muniz
which
is
the
other
case,
which
my
opponent
here
relies
on
very
heavily,
this
court
considered
whether
a
prisoner
could
sue
under
the
federal
claims
act
and
held
unanimously
that
he
certainly
could.
and
the
opinion
contains
language
to
the
effect
that
the
presence
of
a
compensation
system
does
not
necessarily
preclude
the
suit
in
tort.
but
we
think,
and
i
think
we
noted
in
the
second
circuit
whose
decision
this
court
affirmed
and
unanimously
agrees
with
us
because
as
you
know,
the
second
circuit
was
exactly
the
opposite
result
of
the
court
here,
the
third
circuit
did
in
this
case
and
we
think
that
language
as
we
understood
in
consideration
with
the
argument
which
the
argument
was
then
advancing.
the
government
suggested
that
congress
had
provided
a
remedy
in
small
area
for
some
prisoners
and
this
indicated
the
congressional
intent
never
if
not
to
provide
any
other
remedy
for
any
other
prisoners.
that
was
the
argument
which
this
court
rejected.
but
the
court
didn’t
consider
whether
the
fact
that
prisoner
had
a
compensation
remedy
and
was
in
fact
being
paid,
would
preclude
them
from
bringing
suit.
indeed,
the
court
didn’t
mention
patterson,
which
is
the
seamen
in
this
case,
and
then
decided
only
a
few
terms
or
earlier,
and
mentions
yohansen
only
on
the
footnote
in
passing.
i
think
that
the
decision
in
muniz
doesn’t
imply
that
one
who
has
got
an
adequate,
simple,
certain
remedy
is
also
entitled
to
sue
united
states
in
tort
in
addition
to
that
remedy.
i’m
not
saying
of
anything
wrong
of
that,
your
honor.
it’s
just
that
it’s
unusual
and
it
would
be
odd
of
the
ordinary
and
one
would
expect
congress
so
said
something
like
that
and
if
you
particularly
wanted
to
do
so.
i
might
add
that
once
again
that
no
employee
of
the
federal
government
at
all.
any
branch
of
the
government,
civilian
or
military
has
this
right
for
injuries
incurred
there
in
the
course
of
work.
and
indeed,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
uniform
general
rule
in
workmen’s
compensation
act
is
that
what
was
covered
by
the
injury
can
only
sue
to
make
third
parties
or
someone,
some
person
other
than
his
employer.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
indeed
it
would
not.
muniz
himself
was
injured
on
the
course
of
practices.
you
pinned
him
to
private
medicate.
henry
winston,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
a
medical
malpractice
matter.
and
more
than
that,
the
three
cases
which
service
granted
was
in
conflict,
none
of
those
prisoners
could
have
recovered
under
the
compensation
act
either.
i
might
add
that
in
this
regard,
that
the
prisoners
compensation
statute
is
probably
consistent
with
all
workmen’s
compensation
matters.
for
example,
if
you
are
injured
by
you
are
employer
when
you’re
not
working,
then
you’re
free
to
sue
your
employer
in
tort
and
you
are
also
not
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation.
that’s
precisely
what
would
happen
on
the
circumstances
here.
if
this
fellowmen
had
been
injured
to
the
full
negligence
of
the
government
at
the
time
when
it
wasn’t
part
of
his
employment,
it
wasn’t
a
risk
of
employment
which
is
protected,
then
he
would
be
entitled
suit
just
as
mr.
muniz
was.
but
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
the
rule
saying
he
can’t
sue
when
he’s
already
been
given
another
remedy.
i
might
add,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
the
remedy
is
fully
comparable,
we
thought,
to
any
other
workmen’s
compensation
remedies.
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
as
generous
as
given
to
full
time
federal
employees
selected
at
least
supposedly
for
that,
in
the
merit.
but
nonetheless,
it’s
not
inadequate
and
it’s
certainly
matches
the
level
of
those
keeping
the
ground
level,
threshold
level
given
to
federal
employees.
the
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
certainly,
your
honor.
some
of
them,
i’m
afraid,
are
inaccurate
and
some
of
them
are
irrelevant
and
some
of
them
i
think
should
not
make
any
difference
at
all.
as
we
pointed
out
earlier,
it’s
mandatory
how
big
it
by
regulation
of
the
attorney
general
in
force
for
some
35
years
rather
than
expressly
by
statute
of
congress.
but
the
second
one,
the
amount,
if
they
would
arrest
entirely
was
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
is
only
theoretical
problem.
in
essence,
the
attorney
general
has
set
the
regulation
set
that
the
certain
scale
to
be
followed
and
it’s
followed
in
every
case.
it’s
not
very
comprehensible
to
prisoner.
all
they
really
means
is
that
these
details
of
the
compensation
system
has
spelled
out
by
regulation
rather
by
statute.
i
might
add,
do
we
have
this
problem
or
the
problem
came
up
in
the
context
of
persons
who
were
employed
by
nonappropriated
fund
instrumentality
to
the
military
service.
in
short,
the
officers
message
which
were
run,
justice
fortas,
out
of
the
fund
they
take
in
rather
in
treasury
appropriation.
and
the
congress
there
passed
the
statute
which
said
that
those
employees
shall
be
given/provided
workmen’s
compensation
and
left
all
the
details
up
to
the
people
administering
it.
they
simply
went
out
and
got
the
usual
workmen’s
compensation
policy
that
anyone
else
could
have
done.
every
court
of
appeal,
which
has
considered
it,
had
held
that
that
was
exclusive
to
the
policy
they
have.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
i
think
two.
first,
i
don’t
have
to
assume
that
this
should
but
it
isn’t.
and
secondly,
i
thought
–-
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no,
sir.
the
regulations
provide,
for
example,
that
one
may
file
a
claim
for
compensation
but
within
a
year
after
release
from
prison,
as
it
is
you
file
normally
with
file
it
and
upon
release
and
examined
by
prisoner’s
physician
who
have
doctors
there.
if
you
are
not
satisfied,
that’s
what
you
get.
you
can
file
another
claim
upon
release.
indeed
i
think
the
second
circuit
noted
that
in
another
decision.
and
you
can
accompany
that
second
circuit
to
your
claim
with
the
report
of
your
present
physician
and
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
after
he
left
prison.
and
that’s
something
inaccurate,
sir.
in
this
case,
of
course,
he
was
given
the
full
award
before
he
left
prison.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
i
would
certainly
not
deny
that
there
is
a
difference
in
this
case
of
prisoners
between
the
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
only
on
the
sense
that,
at
the
regulation
as
i’ve
told
actually
quite
only
if
he’s
put
back
on
jail
and
not
entirely
correct
even
in
that
case,
your
honor.
the
circumstances
of
this,
the
compensation
is
understood
to
be
in
lieu
of
the
lost
earning
power
that
he
got
because
he
could
no
longer
work.
if
he’s
reconfined
that
there
he
was,
that
then
he’s
no
longer
lost
any
earning
power
and
they
could
cut
off
the
compensation.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
so
long
advised.
moreover,
if
he
has
dependents,
he
can
continue
repay
to
dependents
while
he
has
been
reconfined.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
the
answer
to
that
case,
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstance.
if
the
award
were
made
to
dependents,
they
would
get
it.
the
difficulty
with
the
problem,
i
would
say,
your
honor
is
that
there
haven’t
been
any
cases
that
i
come
across
that
we
know
of
–-
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
your
honor,
let
me
put
in
this
circumstances.
federal
employees
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
have
no
right
to
judicial
review
of
the
actions
of
the
board
giving
or
withholding
compensation
either.
and
to
that
extent,
certainly,
there
is
a
problem
of
whether
this
thing
is
the
administrate
problem.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
no,
your
honor,
he
will
not.
but
cert—
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
true.
but
let
me
point
out
once
again,
your
honor,
we
just
don’t
think
that
is
relevant
to
this
particular
problem.
if
compensation
is
understood
to
be
a
substitution
for
the
wages
you
cannot
earn,
it’s
quite
clear
that
if
you
put
back
in
the
federal
prison
where
he
is
provided
with
food,
clothing
and
shelter,
the
problem
of
the
wages
you
cannot
earn
will
be
obviated.
if
for
example,
he
went
on
private
employment
and
then
he
would
be
put
back
in
jail,
his
private
way
would
cease
immediately.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
well,
in
that
particular
circumstances,
i
think
that
mr.
demko
is
injured
and
the
federal
preclude
him
from
breaking
the
county
since
he
broke
his
leg
and
he
couldn’t
get
away.
but
in
any
event,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
never
deny
that
this
particular
scheme
thus
is
tearing
to
certain
degree
to
prisoners
and
that’s
necessarily.
the
question
is
whether
that
should
mean
any
less
comprehensive
remedy
or
not
i
think
that
doesn’t
make
it
single
difference.
i
don’t
think
we
should
turn
on
that
point,
your
honor.
he
would
not
loss
any
earning
power
or
any
wage
earning
capacity
if
you
will
reconfine.
i’ve
covered,
your
honor,
and
if
you
don’t
have
any
further
questions,
and
all
the
points
that
i’ve
intended
to
make
in
my
opening
argument.
i
would
like
to
save
for
a
moment
for
rebuttal
if
i
have
it.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
i
have
in
answering
the
questions
proposed
by
justice,
just
a
few
words
in
closure.
and,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i’ve
had
the
opportunity
to
check
with
the
federal
prisoner
official
who
are
in
the
courtroom
and
they
say
that
“yes,
the
compensation
is
resumed
upon
whether
the
prisoner
is
released
from
confinement”.
secondly,
regarding
the
letter
which
were
sent
to
all
the
justices
and
our
opposing
counsel,
the
letter
is
quite
accurate
by
both
by
practice
and
regulation.
total
disability
payments
are
geared
to
the
minimum
payments
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
that
was
set
out
in
specific
sum
of
a
$180
a
month
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
until
this
summer.
this
summer,
completely
independent
to
this
proceedings,
congress
raised
to
pay
the
minimum
award
of
$245
a
month
for
all
prisoners
who
were
totally
disabled
not
merely
mr.
demko,
who
received
a
prison
award.
regarding
the
other
amounts,
the
award
for
other
benefits,
it
is
a
schedule
of
benefits.
in
practice
and
under
the
regulations,
they
follow
the
schedule
of
benefit
set
out
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
which
is
normally
set
out
for
the
loss
of
a
particular
member;
so
many
weeks
of
compensation
and
so
forth.
and
they
used
to
compute
the
amount
of
compensation,
the
matter
was
in
tucked
to
which
the
prisoner
is
entitled
the
minimum
wage
that
an
employee
would
be
entitled
to
receive,
any
federal
employee
in
the
united
states
minimum
wage.
that’s
set
out
in
the
regulation
too.
if
you’d
like
further
details,
i
would
be
glad
to
send
an
additional
letter
to
the
court.
i
might
add
that
the
figures
$50
and
$4,000
relating
to
loss
of
finger
and
the
death
come
from
a
letter
which
among
other
things
is
12
years
old.
on
top
of
that,
the
$50
for
a
loss
of
a
finger
probably
was
$50
for
loss
of
a
tip
of
an
index
finger.
if
you
look
at
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
it
has
a
different
monetary
amount
for
any
particular
joint
or
body
loss.
the
death
of
one,
of
course,
it
would
be
determined
of
how
old
the
prisoner
was
and
how
much
time
it
was
like
much
longer
his
life
would
live.
naturally,
$4,000
it
would
for
an
older
man
would
be
unjust.
if
i
may
answer,
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
i
think
mr.
justice
blacks
question
too
about
two
remedies.
the
answer
is,
yes,
that’s
exactly
what
will
be
the
case
here.
we
agree
and
indeed
we
insist,
because
we
insist
there’s
no
tort
remedy
that
this
prisoner
is
entitled
to
compensation
if
he
was
injured
in
the
cause
of
his
work.
and
whether
he
win
or
loss
the
tort
suit,
he
would
get
the
compensation
and
that’s,
of
course,
why
the
government
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
right.
yes,
sir.
if
he’s
injured
in
the
course
of
work,
but
let
me
get
one
other
point
clear.
we’ve
had
a
lot
of
discussion
about,
on
my
recount,
about
the
comprehensiveness
of
remedy.
well,
i
think
the
accurate
is
remedy
is
comprehensive
in
the
same
sense
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
is
comprehensive
in
the
same
sense
that
every
compensation
statute
is
comprehensive.
if
a
man
is
injured
while
working,
he
gets
compensation
benefits.
if
he’s
injured
when
his
not
working
even
because
he
is
bitten
up
by
a
fellow
prisoner
for
negligence,
or
for
that
matter
runover
by
unrelated
truck,
a
government
vehicle,
then
he
can
sue
as
for
tort.
that’s
precisely
mr.
muniz’
situation.
indeed,
there
are
cases,
i
think
with
the
recent
case
the
tenth
circuit
called
browning
v.
united
states,
in
which
the
precisely
that
matter
came
up.
the
federal
employee
was
rundown
by
a
federal
truck
and
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
he
wasn’t
working.
consequently,
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
compensation.
he
gets
the
federal
employees
remedy.
i
might
add
that
the
remedy
as
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out,
is
not
insubstantial.
in
this
particular
case,
$75,000,
i
think
this
is
reasonable
minimum
amount
which
is
to
be
expected
receive
less,
of
course,
because
he
has
a
sudden
accidental
death
earlier.
that
would
be
paid,
of
course,
over
the
years.
moreover,
that’s
something
like
three
times
the
amount
which
the
defendants
would
receive
in
the
perez
cases,
which
this
court
pointed
out
it
was
not
an
insubstantial
amount.
i
might
add
that
in
the
army
cases
to
which
my
brother
makes
reference
here,
it’s
quite
clear
that
no
soldier
was
injured
incident
to
service
pursuant
to
the
tort
claims
act.
the
brown
case
and
the
brooks
case
upon
which
he
cites,
but
times
when
the
soldiers
run
further,
they
weren’t
working
and
they
held
that
they
could
sue
despite
the
benefits.
we
agree
that
in
circumstances
where
the
man
is
not
working,
he
is
entitled
to
sue.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
i
am,
mr.
douglas
that
they
didn’t’
come
up.
i
would
assume
the
answer
that
that
would
be
yes.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
if
they
are
covered
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
and
i
can’t
give
you
the
answer
to
that,
the
answer
is
they
would
be
covered
under
the
statute
because
the
people
of
the
muniz
statute
followed
the
same
standard
in
the
same
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
exactly
true.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
that’s
right.
i
have
presumed
the
assumption
would
be
that
a
prisoner
who
is
not
working,
not
to
be
released,
is
not
supporting
as
defendants.
on
the
other
hand,
a
prisoner
who
dies
in
prison
out
of
accident
might
proceed
and
the
future
be
released
next
day
to
pardon
to
anything.
consequently,
it’s
not
worries
immediately
to
the
widow.
i’d
like
to
add
in
closing
that
we
don’t
think
that
this
statute
is
in
anyway
in
conflict
with
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
indeed,
with
the
express
language
of
it.
i’d
like
to
point
out
again
that
as
i
closed,
that
the
liability
of
the
united
states
imposed
by
that
act
was
to
be,
and
i
quote
from
28
usc
2674,
“imposed
on
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
in
like
circumstances”.
i
have
read
nothing
in
respondent’s
brief
and
i
heard
nothing
here
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
to
suggest
that
in
like
circumstances
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
private
employer
would
recover.
and
moreover,
private
employer-employee
would
not
be
able
to
recover
in
tort
as
private
employee
where
he
was
getting
compensation
remedy
in
pennsylvania
or
for
that
matter
in
any
of
the
50
states
of
this
columbia.
consequently,
we
think
that
the
interpretation
we
put
on
the
prisoner
compensation
system.
it
may
fairly
comports
with
the
act
–
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
salzman
your
honor,
let
me
read
20
of
the
pre-regulations
entering
code.
these
are
the
regulations,
of
course,
promulgated
through
under
the
section
of
the
attorney
general.
nobody
in
the
federal
prison
industry
can
change
them.
section
28
cfr
section
301.2,
“accident
compensation
will
be
paid
to
such
injured
inmates
as
our
totally
or
partially
disabled”
and
it
goes
on
to
say
when.
i
guess
no
question
on
that,
your
honor.
if
i
have
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
