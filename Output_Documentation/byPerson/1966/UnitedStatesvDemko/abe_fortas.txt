justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
difference
in
the
discretionary
element
of
the
scheme?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
compare
with
the
language
of
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
generally?
justice
abe
fortas
such
as
may
to?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
for
prisoners.
how
about
the
others,
how
about
the
general?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it’s
incumbent,
it’s
mandatory?
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
that,
i
take
it
that
your
adversary
puts
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
upon
that
in
reaching
his
conclusion
that
a
compensation
paid
under
the
prisoner’s
act
does
not
preclude
a
recovery
under
the
tort
claim,
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
you
maintain
the
attorney
general’s
regulation,
had
maintained
the
discretionary
feature
of
it,
in
your
opinion,
would
that
affect
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
scheme?
justice
abe
fortas
with
or
without
fault?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
in
these
instances,
there
might
be
inaction.
and
he
had
a
recovery,
he
would
not
have
to
quit
it
to
receive
this
award?
justice
abe
fortas
your
opponent
also
wants
to
guide
us
procedure
on
deficiencies
in
this
scheme
and
that
is
no
opportunity
for
administrant
of
review
and
no
provision
that
have
a
personal
position
pursuant
his
examination
and
so
on.
assuming
that
all
that
were
true,
what’s
your
response
to
his
contention
that
that
shall
leave
this
court
to
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
preclusive
remedy.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it’s
not
true?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
point
that
your
opponent
makes
that
the
compensation
paid
to
him
is
subject
to
being
suspended
and
he’s
subsequently
convicted
of
a
crime.
or
i
suppose
that
he’s
release
on
parole
and
the
parole
revoked
that.
i’m
at
that
point.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
this
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
it
resume
when
he’s
released?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
sure?
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
the
dependents
have
the
right
to.
that’s
what
the
word,
i
think.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
so
admitted
that
they
call
this
as
a
good
deal
of
discretion
in
the
federal
prison
industries
authorities,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
suppose
mr.
demko
was
arrested
for
making
of
another
crime
and
put
in
jail
again.
if
your
opponent’s
brief
is
correct,
then
at
that
point,
the
compensation
award
to
him
would
cease.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
was
he
is
thereafter
be
able
to
bring
this
suit
on
the
federal
tort
side?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
let’s
suppose
he
gets
sides
on
parole,
it
violates
parole.
he’s
then
picked
up
and
put
back
in
jail.
his
compensation
ceases
then?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
may
be
that‘s
pretty
easy
because
may
be
he
was
not
broken
or
household
(inaudible)
the
county
would
pay
him
enough
compensation.
i
don’t
know
why
they
did
that.
justice
abe
fortas
you’re
fair
raising
collecting
on
the
both,
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
from
your
claim,
your
theory
is,
if
i
correctly
understand
you
that
a
federal
prisoner
could
both
apply
for
compensation
and
he
gets
compensation
award
and
then
he
can
sue
in
the
federal
court
and
the
federal
torts
claim
act.
you’re
theory
is
then
that
any
award,
any
judgment
in
his
favor
under
the
federal
torts
claim
act
is
reduced
by
the
maniacal
concession.
justice
abe
fortas
but
these
are
not
all
alternative
remedies.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
difference
in
the
discretionary
element
of
the
scheme?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
compare
with
the
language
