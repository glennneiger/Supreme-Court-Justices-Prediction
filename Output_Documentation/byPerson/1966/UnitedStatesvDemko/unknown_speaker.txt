what

was
there

isn’t
it
a

a

(inaudible)

under

but
that’s
not

it
does
not
what?
unknown

do
you
have
any

with
the

in
this

set
forth
in
your

the

if
you
will
excuse
me,
mr.
ziskind,
but
with
respect
to
your
comments
about
the
absence
of
a
minimum
relief,
may
be
what
they
elaborated
as
the

is
this
the

represented
the

how
(voice

--
that

indicating

there
was

minimum
--
unknown

you
mean
you
should
have
read
that
(voice

unknown

may
i
ask
you
with
this
thing?
unknown
speaker
is
it
true
of
you
that
the
prisoner
would
–
where
they
gets
the
compensation
whether
or
not
that
you
know
it’s
discretional,
be
able
to
retain
the
compensation
if
he
gets
the
recovery
under
the
tort
claims
act?
unknown
speaker
i’m
sorry.
the
answer
is
no
he
cannot
–
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
right
of
the
$20,000
after
crediting
in
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
but
you
settled
for
trial?
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
they
deny
of
that?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
prisons
deny
the
compensation
at
the
time
of
the
judgment?
unknown

what
if
the
prison
deny
that
(inaudible)?
unknown

(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
when
this
compensation
is
terminated
in
those
circumstances,
can
you
tell
us
whether
it
is
renewed
that
the
prisoner
gets
inside
of
the
jail
again?
unknown
speaker
you
know
of
no
rules
covering
at
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
i’d
be
very
interested
in
a
categorical
answer
to
that
if
it
can
be
obtained.
unknown

(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
mean
in
the

unknown

now
the

says
(inaudible)
must
be
alleged,
isn’t
it?
unknown

to
the
federal
employees
act.
unknown

the

(inaudible)

unknown

that’s
the
practice?
unknown

you

whether
they
have
(inaudible)
unknown

there
must
be
--
unknown

did
you
have
a
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
different
from
the
ordinary
workmen’s
compensation
system?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
from
counsel
that
this
could
apply
here.
unknown
speaker
every
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
when
did
he
then
be
entitled
to
come
under
the
tort
claims
act?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
he
only
works
at
certain
number

i
mean
a

unknown

well,
he
is
covered
while
he
is
working.
unknown
speaker
--
if
the
jurors
--
that
prisoners
can
recover
under
both?
unknown
speaker
yes?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
all
the
prisoners
will
be
compelled
to
sue
with
the
court
then?
unknown
speaker
--
the
prisoner
who
couldn’t
show
negligence
couldn’t
get
anything?
unknown
speaker
well
he
gets
something
out
of
the
compensation?
unknown
speaker
they
didn’t
have
to
be
negligent
under
the
compensation
act?
unknown
speaker
now
i’ve
just
a
question
why
he
would
recover
from
the
compensation
if
he
was
injured
regardless
of
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
now
what’s
your
claim
on
doe
as
i
understand
it
would
knock
out
all
prisoners
unless
they
could
show
negligence?
unknown
speaker
who
didn’t
show
negligence?
unknown
speaker
he
can
get
it
now.
unknown
speaker
the
clause
is
the
same
--
your
man
here.
would
he
have
to
show
negligence
now?
unknown
speaker
this
man,
it
seems
to
me
like
i
don’t
know
of
government
case
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
like
you’re
throwing
them
all
from
the
other
undecided
claims
in
a
tort
act
and
casting
them
entirely
outside
the
benefits
of
this
other,
which
i
understand
it
he’s
getting
$225
a
month.
unknown
speaker
how
much
is
he
getting?
unknown
speaker
for
how
long?
unknown
speaker
and
he’d
lost
that
entirely
unless
he
could
prove
negligence.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
i’m
talking
about
the
people
who
--
this
is
--
the
government
holds
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
also,
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
give
prisoners
a
right
to
exists
better
than
the
negligence
denial.
unknown
speaker
(voice

$245
a
month
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ziskind,
isn’t
really
the
thrust
of
your
argument
that
the
compensation
remedy
has
two
chances
to
read
from
it
an
intention
by
congress
to
bar
the
prisoner
from
having
an
exception
under
the
tort
claim.
unknown
speaker
without
an
express
provision
of
the
–
unknown
speaker
--
the
compensation
system
or
whatever
it
is
covers
what
it
covers.
i
suppose
a
federal
employee
who
was
off
duty
completely
and
away
from
his
place
of
work
and
was
hit
by
a
male
truck,
negligently
driven
by
its
driver
could
recover
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
is
not
covered
under
that
situation,
he
does
has
another
federal
tort
claim
remedy.
in
this
case,
your
client
was
covered
by
the
compensation
system.
unknown
speaker
whatever
it
states
too,
in
fact
he
was
covered.
unknown
speaker
is
it
unreasonable
to
say
that
congress
males
so
have
intended
that
if
this
fellow
applied
for
compensation
that
they
couldn’t
thereafter
bring
an
action
under
the
federal
torts
act.
there
were
findings
something
in
the
statute
–
unknown
speaker
you
know
why
--
is
it
your
position
that’s
unreasonable
to
say
that
when
congress
passed
federal
tort
act,
congress
said
that,
“well,
perhaps
this
would
be
available
to
prisoners
generally
but
not
to
prisoners
who
have
filed
for
an
award
under
the
prisoners
compensation
act
and
they
have
received
that
award.
unknown
speaker
of
course
this
man
tried
his
law
suit
before
the
jury?
would
you
say
he
could
still
recover
the
prisoner’s
compensation?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
award
and
i
don’t
mean
award.
did
he
recover
his
lost,
his
losses
on
this
tort?
unknown
speaker
let’s
suppose
he
is
not
receiving
compensation.
unknown
speaker
but
he
sues
of
a
tort
and
losses
it.
he
then
turn
around
and
recover
on
his
facts
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
so
he
could
recover
on
both?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
we
know
which
one
here
sue
and
which
one
he
could
sue
on.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
his
own
choice,
he
doesn’t
waive
it,
does
it,
by
suing.
unknown
speaker
(voice

tort
claim
and
then
loss
it
and
then
come
back
in
post
claim
under
the
–
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
it’s
declared
exactly
there.
unknown
speaker
that’s
automatically
deducted
if
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
two
remedies?
unknown
speaker
not
because
you
say
he
is
entitled
to
compensation?
unknown
speaker
are
they
covered
under
the
federal
employees
act?
unknown
speaker
and
do
i
correctly
understand
that
death
due
to
injury
at
work
results
in
a
compensation
payment
to
heirs
next
to
him,
i
take
it
quite
properly
after
death
or
as
if
he
survives
from
injury
at
work,
he
gets
nothing
until
he’s
released,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
he
gets
only
care
and—
unknown
speaker
one
last
question.
unknown
speaker
the
prisoners
compensation
system
you
say
gives
the
prisoner
incidence
where
a
claim
of
right?
unknown
speaker
but
it’s
not
payable
when
left
his

what
can
you
say
to
that?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a

unknown

isn’t
