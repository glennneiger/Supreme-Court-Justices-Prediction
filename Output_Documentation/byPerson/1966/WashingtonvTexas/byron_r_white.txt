justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
there
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
where
is
that
offered
proof
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
are
--
did
i
misunderstand
you?
are
you
challenging
this
on
its
face
or
as
applied
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
--
so
before
your
position
is
irrelevant
what
this
witness
would
testify
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
don't'
need
to
know
what
character
--
what
the
judgment
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
still
can't
find
any
statement
in
the
record
as
to
what
he
would
have
testified
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you?
i
suppose
--
what
would
you
say
if
the
--
does
the
defendant
calls
a
witness
and
the
witness
gets
some
stand
and
he
is
asked
a
question
that
calls
for
hearsay,
would
you
think
--
then
it
has
a
right
to
elicit
that
hearsay
from
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
hearsay
is
unreliable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
texas
legislature
says,
not
only
is
hearsay
unreliable
but
testimony
of
uncertain
witness
with
a
certain
relationship
to
another
is
unreliable.
we
judge
both
to
be
unreliable
in
the
same
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
think
our
question
is
--
isn't
the
rationality
of
the
texas
court's
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
texas
legislature
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
let's
--
let's
say
that
the
texas
legislature
had
a
statute
which
it
may
have,
i
don't
know
against
hearsay.
that
no
hearsay
in
our
courts
except
in
limited
--
with
limited
exception
and
the
reason
is
that
it's
unreliable.
do
you
agree
with
that
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
then
that
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
believe
and
then
the
texas
legislature
also
has
the
present
statute,
codefendants
may
not
testify
if
the
state
objects?
what
if
you
believe
that
that
was
as
rational
as
the
hearsay
rule,
you
wouldn't
think
then
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
outlaw
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
outlaw
the
hearsay
statute,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
agree
with
that.
that's
the
question.
do
you
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
violated
by
a
hearsay
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
believe
that
the
codefendant
statute
was
as
rational
as
a
hearsay
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
testimony
of
your
codefendant
was
as
unreliable
as
hearsay.
now
let's
just
assume
that.
then
i
suppose
you
can
not
reach
the
same
conclusion
on
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
except
for
hearsay?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
to
hearsay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
one
more
then
--
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
you
were
to
hear
from
one
of
these
other
states
that
has
a
statute
like
this
except
that
it
applies
to
both
the
state
and
the
defendant,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
let's
assume
right
here
that
in
this
--
this
was
in
another
state
what
happened
here
and
the
defendant
offered
his
codefendant
(voice
overlap)
objection.
i
suppose
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
such
that
that's
an
irrational
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
that
your
basis
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
overwrite
sensible
or
rational
testimonial
qualifications
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
there
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
where
is
that
offered
proof
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
are
--
did
i
misunderstand
you?
are
you
challenging

justice
byron

could
i
ask
you?
i

what
