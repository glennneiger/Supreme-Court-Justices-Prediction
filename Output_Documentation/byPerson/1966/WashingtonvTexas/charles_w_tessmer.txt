mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
question
presented
before
this
court
is
a
civil
one
but
one
of
vital
importance.
is
petitioner's
conviction
void
because
his
rights
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution
were
denied
by
the
trial
court,
in
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
compulsory
process
to
obtain
a
witness
who
it
permitted
to
testify
and
who
was
available,
would
have
exonerated
the
petitioner
of
the
crime
of
murder
if
the
testimony
were
believed.
that
basically
is
the
constitutional
issue
before
this
honorable
court.
now,
petitioner
washington
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it
is
now
repealed,
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
of
january
1,
1966.
it
was
a
statutory
rule,
article
711
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
since
repealed.
now,
petitioner
washington--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor.
all
codefendants
are
now
competent
under
the
statute
in
texas
now
to
testify
either
for
or
against
one
another.
petitioner
washington
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
and
given
50
years.
he
testified
to
the
facts
that
would
have
exonerated
him
if
believed
by
the
jury.
the
only
other
person
in
this
world
who
could
have
exonerated
petitioner
washington
was
the
codefendant,
philip,
who
had
previously
been
tried
under
a
separate
indictment
for
the
same
murder
and
assessed
of
50
years.
fuller
was
available.
fuller
would've
testified
that
the
petitioner
was
attempting
to
keep
him
from
pulling
the
trigger,
saying,
“don't
shoot!
i'm
going
to
leave,
just
don't
do
it”.
and
that
fuller
would
have
testified
that
jackie
washington
left
before
he
fired
the
fatal
shot.
only
three
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
the
point
was
protected
in
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
a
hearing
for
motion
for
new
trial.
i
would
like
to
point
out
this
proposition
to
this
court.
i
feel
that
judgment
must
be
reversed
whether
we
view
(inaudible)
case
through
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it's
in
the
stipulated
record,
mr.
justice
white,
and
it
is
--
and
admitted
in
the
state's
answering
brief.
i
believe
it
is
at
page
9
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
your
honor.
whether
we
approach
this
case
through
the
sixth
amendment
by
way
of
the
fourteenth
as
enforcing
the
sixth
amendment
the
right
to
compulsory
process,
directly
or
whether
we
approach
it
directly
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
result
should
be
the
same
as
the
right
to
a
witness
in
one's
behalf
particularly
a
witness
so
vital
as
here
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
pointed
out
in
palko
versus
connecticut.
this
question
has
been
settled
in
the
courts
of
appeal
where
it
has
arisen.
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
well-reasoned
opinion
has
held
in
effect
in
the
robinsons
versus
pate,
which
is
not
in
the
brief,
345
f.2d
691,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
that
in
the
wake
of
gideon
versus
wainwright,
or
pointer
versus
texas,
and
all
of
those
great
decisions
implicitly
holding
the
right
to
effective
counsel.
that
the
result
must
be
the
same
with
reference
to
compulsory
process,
that
it
is
implicit
in
any
concept
to
the
ordered
liberty
and
justice
whether
we
view
it
alone
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
we
view
it
that
that
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
incorporated
and
obligatory
on
the
states
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
interacting
with
the
sixth.
the
result
must
be
the
same.
now
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
compulsory
process.
the
right
to
compulsory
process;
to
make
a
fair
defense
is
a
concept
of
fundamental
justice
in
our
opinion
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
unreported
opinion
dated
february
the
15th
1967,
number
23803,
bonner
versus
beto
is
directly
in
point
with
this
case.
the
facts
are
critically
the
same.
in
that
particular
case,
the
same
statute,
article
711
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
was
applied.
the
petitioner
in
that
case,
the
appellant
in
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit,
have
tried
to
use
his
wife,
who
was
a
codefendant
who
had
been
tried
and
given
a
suspended
sentence
for
burglary.
her
testimony
would
have
been
that
he,
the
petitioner,
was
returning
the
stolen
goods
and
did
not
participate
in
the
burglary.
her
testimony
was
excluded.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
approached
this
problem
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
that
in
any
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
that
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
right
to
due
process
of
law,
apart
from
whether
the
sixth
amendment
is
incorporated
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
as
to
compulsory
process,
require
their
version
of
that
conviction.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
bonner
versus
beto.
the
result
is
the
same
in
that
case.
bonner
is
now
not
on
--
is
now
on
motion
for
rehearing,
i
am
advised
by
the
attorney
general's
department
of
texas.
the
result
in
bonner
versus
beto
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
result
in
robinson
versus
pate
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
the
robinson
v.
pate,
the
accused
person
in
which
he
called
two
witnesses
and
have
compulsory
process
who
could
have
testified
that
right
after
the
event,
he
was
acting
bizarre;
that
he
may
have
been
insane
to
lay
witness.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reached
the
result
to
applying
the
sixth
amendment
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth.
bonner
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
mr.
justice,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
the
failure
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
under
article
711
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
agree
with
that
to
this
extent.
he
was
available.
the
process
was
available.
the
process
was
used
but
its
effective
use
was
denied
by
the
particular
application
of
that
statute
to
this
petitioner
as
effectively
denied
as
if
there
were
no
law
required.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
unquestionably
so.
under
ferguson
against
georgia
as
pointed
out,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
a
concurring
opinion
that
the
georgia
statute
which
prohibited
the
testimony
of
a
defendant;
prohibited
his
being
sworn,
should
be
struck
down
even
though
petitioner
in
that
case
had
not
raised
the
point
below.
and
that
case
was
reversed
on
the
basis
that
the
amending
statute
did
not
permit
the
accused
counsel
to
question
this
man
and
making
a
statement
unsworn
before
the
jury.
and
that
that
in
effect
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
clark's
view
that
the
whole
statute
was
unconstitutional
when
tested
and
measured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
agree
with
that.
yes,
this
is
a
bad
statute
but
i
would
say
that
texas
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
thank
you,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
say
that
we
have
recognized
the
error
of
our
ways
by
the
repeal
of
that
statute
but
i
would
further
say
in
candor
to
this
honorable
court
that
texas
can
make
rules
by
statute
or
otherwise
as
to
who
is
competent
as
a
witness
and
as
to
who
is
not.
but
here,
it
is
the
application
of
this
particular
statute,
not
necessarily
its
unconstitutionality
that
works
an
injustice
on
jackie
washington,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
now,
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
we
know
that
effective
assistance
of
the
denial
of
counsel
means
the
denial
of
effective
counsel.
that
was
the
decision
in
powell
against
alabama
upon
which
gideon
against
wainwright
was
decided.
i
would
further
like
to
point
out
to
this
honorable
court
the
concept
adhered.
this
is
a
particular
or
was
a
particularly
vicious
statute.
interest,
according
to
black
stone,
i
believe,
was
the
only
disqualification
of
parties
if
they
had
understanding
of
the
event
and
reason.
this
statute
as
the
holdover
of
the
old
dead
hand
of
the
common-law
and
as
opposed
to
public
policy
of
turning
on
all
possible
light
for
the
jury
and
let
them
assess
credibility.
but
our
statute
was
particularly
vicious
and
that
it
permitted
this
supposed
interested
witness,
the
codefendant,
to
testify
for
the
state
but
not
for
defendant.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
am
challenging
it,
mr.
justice
white
on
its
face
and
as
applied
here
also
and
whether
we
arrive
at
the
result
to
applying
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
compulsory
process
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
this
is
implicit
just
like
in
the
--
held
by
this
honorable
court
in
pointer
versus
texas.
they
are
the
holding
being
the
right
of
compensation
under
the
sixth
amendment
by
the
majority
would
be
applied
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
as
obligatory
on
the
state
of
texas.
alright
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
judging
the
statute,
perhaps
not
but
i
am
aware
of
the
harmless
error
rule
and
how
--
if
this
witness
have
no
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
could
have
helped
the
petitioner.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
record,
i
believe,
bears
us
out
as
to
what
he
would
testify
to
at
page
4,
your
honor,
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
approved
by
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
which
is
our
way
of
settling
the
appeals
sometime
from
the
points
and
when
approved
by
the
judge
and
accepted
as
qualified,
page
4
of
the
record,
that
is
controlling
even
over
the
statement
of
facts
under
texas
practice,
mr.
justice
white.
even
if
the
shorthand
reporter
had
it
different,
if
the
trial
judge
approves
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
the
facts
stated
therein,
it
controls
over
the
statement
of
facts.
and
the
honorable
judge
meath
(ph)
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
approved
that
bill
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
with
the
purported
evidence
which
would
have
been
exculpated
the
petitioner
had
it
been
believed.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses,
which
means
the
right
to
have
counsel
there
to
cross-examine,
is
intertwined
with
the
right
to
counsel
and
if
compulsory
process
is
necessary
to
get
the
witnesses
there
to
have
a
fair
trial,
then
it
is
just
as
implicit
in
any
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
the
right
of
confrontation
as
so
held
in
pointer
against
texas.
now,
as
to
the
results
in
this
case,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
we
approach
this
case
strictly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process,
the
right
to
be
heard,
the
right
to
make
a
fair
defense
as
applied
in
this
particular
case
or
whether
we
approach
it
that
the
sixth
amendment
provisions
of
the
right
to
compulsory
process
is
incorporated
and
obligatory
against
the
state
of
texas
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
i
feel
that
my
opponent,
by
reading
their
brief,
would
possibly
err
that
the
recent
opinion
of
spencer
against
texas
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
case.
i
seriously
challenge
that
position.
i
think
spencer
against
texas,
the
majority
opinion
simply
holds
that
where
element
is
relevant
to
a
conviction
under
the
prosecution
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute
that
where
a
relevant
evidence
is
admissible,
though
it
is
harmful
and
damaging
to
the
accused
it
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension.
why?
because
there
was
no
provision
pointed
out
in
spencer
against
texas.
implicitly
in
the
bill
of
rights,
there
was
no
ex
--
implicit
constitutional
provision
violated
in
spencer
against
texas
and
this
court
held
in
majority.
and
i
think
with
sound
reasoning,
with
all
due
difference
to
the
dissent
that
in
trials
of
this
nature,
some
prejudice
is
bound
to
occur
to
the
defendant
in
the
admission
of
relevant
testimony.
we
might
get
to
the
point
to
where
bloody
pictures
were
relevant
could
be
so
bad
that
the
accused
would
contend
they
violate
process.
but
i
think
that
here
we
have
a
horse
of
a
different
coat.
and
in
my
humble
opinion,
pointer
against
texas,
gideon
against
wainwright,
the
sound
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
robinson
v.
pate,
the
viciousness
of
this
statute
which
is
aimed
against,
but
which
says
the
man
is
not
interested,
the
codefendant
if
he
is
called
by
the
state
even
though
he
has
been
tried
and
convicted
or
untried,
that
he
can
testify.
but
the
only
way
the
defendant
under
that
statute
could
use
this
witness
was
to
make
a
false
accusation.
now
what
would
the
defendant
have
to
do
to
use
fuller,
the
codefendant.
he
would
have
to
file
a
false
affidavit
that
fuller
was
not
guilty
and
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
fuller,
and
that
fuller
should
be
first
tried.
then
and
only
then
if
fuller
was
tried
and
acquitted
could
petitioner
use
that
witness.because
--
not
make
this
false
affidavit,
fuller
was
guilty.
the
only
other
way
he
could
use
fuller's
evidence
was
this
--
was
if
the
state
of
texas
would
wait
50
years
or
until
the
man
was
released
and
had
satisfied
his
conviction
then
he
could
be
called
or
if
the
prosecution
were
dismissed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
perhaps
three
minutes
for
rejoinder.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
by
way
of
a
few
brief
concluding
remarks,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
only
a
few
states
prohibit
the
use
of
a
codefendant
at
this
time.
they're
listed
in
the
appendix
a
of
the
brief.
that's
alabama,
alaska,
kansas,
nebraska,
south
dakota,
texas,
and
wyoming.
i
do
believe
however
that
in
fundamental
fairness,
the
other
states
outside
of
my
home
state
texas
apply
the
rule
equally
against
the
state
and
against
the
defendant
in
prohibiting
the
competency
of
a
codefendant
as
a
witness.
with
reference
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it's
my
opinion,
that's
true
your
honor.
the
state
cannot
in
those
few
states,
not
--
neither
can
the
defendant.
but
in
texas,
the
state
may
call
the
accused
co-principal.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
to
my
knowledge
no
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
to
my
knowledge,
no
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
answer
to
counsel's
argument
about
the
record,
i
would
suggest
fuller
versus
the
state,
the
opinion
cited
in
our
brief.
the
codefendant
being
first
tried
as
to
whether
or
not
he
mislead
the
state.
his
confession
introduced
by
the
state.
he
stated
as
follows,
then
i
saw
a
man
come
out
on
--
of
the
house
on
the
porch.
this
is
codefendant
fuller
testifying
in
his
confession
used
for
the
state.
that's
when
i
shot
the
gun
one
time,
jackie
ran.
jackie
is
washington.
therefore
the
state
used
this
evidence,
(inaudible)
but
its
true
that
jackie
did
not
fire
the
gun
and
that
he
ran.
and
i
therefore
challenge
counsel's
remarks
about
perjury
and
what
had
happened
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that's
the
confession
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
fuller
did,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
admitted
that
in
the
trial
record
of
firing
a
shot,
he
simply
tried
to
justify
it
on
the
grounds
that
he
meant
to
frighten
and
did
not
intend
to
hit
the
deceased
when
he
came
on
the
front
porch,
when
he
fired
the
shotgun.
but
in
his
confession
made
shortly
after
arrest
used
for
the
state,
he
clearly
exonerated
our
client.
now,
i
think
all
agree
that
a
man
is
not
guilty
of
a
crime
by
being
physically
present
at
the
scene
unless
he
by
act,
word,
or
gesture
encourages
the
commission.
the
defense
withdrew
from
the
intention
and
the
plan
is
a
valid
defense
and
was
so
charged
by
the
jury
in
the
washington
case.
by
way
of
conclusion,
mr.
justice
harlan
pointedly
remarked
yesterday,
is
this
in
fact
a
compulsory
process
case?
i
would
say
yes.
i
disagree
with
the
attorney
general
of
texas
when
he
states
that
process
means
merely
getting
one
to
court.
i
think
the
effective
process
is
the
same
as
effective
counsel,
that
the
legitimate
ends
of
process
is
to
not
get
the
man
to
the
court
outdoor
and
stop
there
but
to
get
him
into
the
witness
box
where
he
can
tell
a
truthful
story.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
no
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
not
in
every
case.
i
would
say
that
compulsory
effective
process
means
where
the
evidence
is
legitimate,
where
it
is
being
applied
to
deny
the
truth.
here
the
petitioner
itself
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
very
true,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
that
the
application
in
a
given
case
might
fall.
my
point
would
be
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
we
approach
this
case
to
the
sixth
amendment
by
way
of
the
fourteenth
by
incorporation.
or
whether
we
approach
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone
because
in
any
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
the
precept
that
one
should
have
a
right
to
offer
the
truth
by
way
of
defense
is
a
valid
precept
in
law
and
one
that
should
be
enforced
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
answer
that
when
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
then
your
honor
i
would
argue
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
under
the
fundamental
fairness
doctrine
the
right
to
be
heard,
the
right
to
make
a
defense
in
court
that
certainly
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit
reasoned
in
bonner
v.
beto.
that
where
the
state
by
legislation
and
the
trial
judge
by
enforcing
the
state
statute
by
order
suppresses,
suppresses
evidence
showing
the
truth,
the
truth
of
the
accused
is
not
guilty,
then
certainly
the
principles
of
brady
against
maryland
should
be
brought
in
this
case.
and
therefore
the
conviction
would
be
just
as
invalid
where
the
state
legislature
suppresses
the
truth
by
statute.
and
the
trial
judge
enforced
it
from
as
if
the
prosecutor
or
the
attorney
general
of
texas
suppressed
evidence
knowingly
that
would
show
innocence
of
the
accused.
i
think
either
--
by
authority
of
brady
against
maryland
or
by
authority
of
pointer
against
texas
specifically
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process,
this
case
should
be
reversed.
as
pointed
out
in
the
ferguson
case
and
in
concluding,
that
where
a
truth
is
sought
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
shown
by
way
of
defense.
that
it
would
seem
that
any
bar
to
the
ascertainment
of
that
truth
which
is
not
reasonable
are
not
applied
to
both
parties
must
fall
as
was
said
in
the
ferguson
case.
the
indulgence
in
such
an
age
worn
time
disallowed
principle
would
be
to
go
backwards
into
the
past.
and
i
respectfully
submit
in
conclusion
that
this
case
must
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
there
are
some
circuit
court
of
appeals
cases
and
i
believe
theoni
(ph)
holds
that
and
also
robinson
versus
pate.
it
is
cladly
--
a
clad
holding
on
the
sixth
amendment
that
that
embodies
the
right
to
have
those
witnesses
in
the
witness
box.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
in
robinson,
he
had
asked
for
some
witnesses.
he
claimed
insanity
as
a
defense.
the
counsel
did
not
subpoena
the
two
lay
witnesses
who
saw
him
shortly
after
the
homicide.
and
as
a
result,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
in
the
wake
of
gideon
against
wainwright,
and
that
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment
means
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
is
very
true.
now
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well
of
course,
looking
at
the
federal
decisions
in
funk
versus
the
united
states,
i
believe
that
would
be
the
holding
in
that
case
where
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
common
law
rule
was
previously
that
a
wife
was
incompetent
to
testify
for
her
husband
because
of
interest.
the
funk
court
--
this
honorable
court
in
that
case
overruled
the
common
law
rule
in
the
light
of
human
experience
and
reason
permitting
the
testimony.
on
the
other
hand,
the
privilege
has
been
sustained.
i
believe
in
a
man,
that
prosecution
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
now
we
do
have
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
we
do
have
statutes
in
texas
that
waive
the
wife's
privilege
in
many
cases
not
to
be
called
by
the
state.
the
legislature
recently
passed
a
statute
holding
that
the
wife
in
incest
prosecutions
could
testify
even
though
normally
she
would
be
barred.
so
it's
a
matter
of
legislative
enactment.
i
wish
to
thank
this
honorable
court
for
hearing.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
certainly
not
your
honor.
the
rules
of
evidence
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
because
we
deal
with
rules
that
have
a
guarantee
of
truthfulness
to
it.
ours
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
unreliable.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
then
i
think
this
honorable
court
should
weigh
in
the
balance,
the
reason
for
it,
and
the
effectiveness
of
such
a
rule.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
particularly
the
rationale.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
to
this
extent
that
the
judgment
of
the
texas
legislature
and
the
enforcement
of
this
particular
statute,
allowing
the
prosecution
to
indict
those
they
think
are
involved
in
the
crime,
and
thereby
eliminate
every
possible
witness
that's
indicted
until
he's
tried
and
acquitted.
certainly
that
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
agree
they
could
certainly
do
that
mr.
justice
white
because
the
dying
declaration
is
statutory.
we
find
the
--
a
reason
that
it's
trustworthy
when
a
man's
dying.
and
he
says
somebody
shot
me.
hearsay
is
untrustworthy
but
we
permit
exceptions.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
outlaw
the
statute
if
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
would
outlaw
this
statute,
mr.
justice
white,
if
its
application
evolved
and
invoked
the
depravation
of
sixth
amendment
rights.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
say
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well,
first
of
all
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
answer
it
this
way.
the
credibility
as
for
the
jury,
as
triers
of
the
fact,
they
can
adjudge
the
credibility
of
the
codefendant
far
better
than
the
legislative.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
or
even
the
attorney
general
figures
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
subject
to
hearsay,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
feel
that
would
be
highly
unfair,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
we
do
not
prohibit
the
state
from
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it's
the
law
in
our
courts
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
mr.
justice
stewart
since
time
immemorial,
our
courts
and
all
courts
of
law,
england
is
not
to
the
contrary,
have
recognized
the
most
intimate
relationship
in
the
world
as
man
and
wife.
and
that
anything
that
comes
between
what
god
has
joined
together,
they
must
follow
unless
there's
a
real
necessity
for
it.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
agree
with
that
and
i
certainly
think
it
must
face
the
balancing
of
interest
test
just
like
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
prosecution
from
calling
the
defendant
and
ascertaining
truth.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
certainly,
but
we
must
here
balance
the
rights
involved
which
is
more
important
to
fifth,
the
fourteenth
and
the
sixth
where
they
conflict.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
certainly
think
so
and
i
think
it
would
go
back
to
a
fundamental
fair
right
to
trial
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
of
course,
the
hearsay
rule
has
no
application
except
for
the
matters
offered
to
prove
the
truth
thereof.
secondly
i
would
say
that
the
hearsay
rule
is
valid
and
reasonable.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
out
of
court
statements
made
without
the
sanction
of
both
which
you're
offered
to
prove
that
that
statement
is
true
and
made
without
the
right
of
confrontation
of
that
hearsay
witness,
and
made
without
the
right
to
cross-examine
that
hearsay
witness
would
certainly
be
violative
of
due
process.
certainly
if
there's
a
valid
reason
for
it
because
we
just
said
in
pointer
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
it
is
heard
without
confrontation
as
in
pointer
and
without
the
right
to
effective
counsel
to
cross-examine
that
hearsay
declarant
who
made
the
statement
out
of
court.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
is
very
true.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
there
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
there
were
only
two
witnesses
in
the
world
who
knew
what
happened.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
your
honor,
there's
some
colloquy
in
the
record
about
objections.
the
citation
is
397
s.w.
2d,
south
western
reporter
second
at
page
434
wherein
the
state
used
fuller's
confession
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
what
happened.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor
and
verbatim
in
toto.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
is
our
offer
of
proof.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
in
the
settled
bill
of
exception.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor
and
that
is
corroborated
by
the
full
confession
of
fuller
set
out,
offered
at
his
preliminary
trial.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
so
the
state
had
knowledge
of
this.
they
used
it.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
with
this
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
on
the
sixth
amendment
with
this
exception
mr.
justice
white.
and
that
is
that
if
the
rule
were
applied
equally
against
the
state
and
the
defendant
equally,
that
neither
one
could
use
him.
and
if
the
rule
as
i
believe
it
to
be
in
some
of
those
states
is
that
after
trial
of
the
other
man,
he
has
no
interest
whether
he's
convicted
or
whether
he's
acquitted,
then
from
many
of
those
states
permit
him
to
testify.
we
don't.
we'd
have
to
wait
50
years.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
by
virtue
of
the
concurring
opinion
in
ferguson
against
georgia,
i
would
agree
wholeheartedly
with
that
concurrence
that
that
statute
should
fall.
justice
--
some
of
the
justices
felt
that
the
article
40,
416,
georgia
code
should
fall
even
though
there
was
no
objection
in
the
trial
court
to
not
being
sworn.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
agree
with
that
to
some
extent,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
that
--
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
balancing,
i
would
say
that
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
somewhat
relative
and
this
is
something
that
you
couldn't
automatically
say
work
the
constitutional
deprivation
whether
it
was
six
months
or
three
months
or
a
year.
certainly,
it's
not
as
strong
as
pointer
confrontation,
cross-examination,
and
compulsory
process.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
question
presented
before
this
court
is
a
civil
one
but
one
of
vital
importance.
is
petitioner's
conviction
void
because
his
rights
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution
were
denied
by
the
trial
court,
in
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
compulsory
process
to
obtain
a
witness
who
it
permitted
to
testify
and
who
was
available,
would
have
exonerated
the
petitioner
of
the
crime
of
murder
if
the
testimony
were
believed.
that
basically
is
the
constitutional
issue
before
this
honorable
court.
now,
petitioner
washington
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it
is
now
repealed,
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
of
january
1,
1966.
it
was
a
statutory
rule,
article
711
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
since
repealed.
now,
petitioner
washington--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor.
all
codefendants
are
now
competent
under
the
statute
in
texas
now
to
testify
either
for
or
against
one
another.
petitioner
washington
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
and
given
50
years.
he
testified
to
the
facts
that
would
have
exonerated
him
if
believed
by
the
jury.
the
only
other
person
in
this
world
who
could
have
exonerated
petitioner
washington
was
the
codefendant,
philip,
who
had
previously
been
tried
under
a
separate
indictment
for
the
same
murder
and
assessed
of
50
years.
fuller
was
available.
fuller
would've
testified
that
the
petitioner
was
attempting
to
keep
him
from
pulling
the
trigger,
saying,
“don't
shoot!
i'm
going
to
leave,
just
don't
do
it”.
and
that
fuller
would
have
testified
that
jackie
washington
left
before
he
fired
the
fatal
shot.
only
three
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
the
point
was
protected
in
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
a
hearing
for
motion
for
new
trial.
i
would
like
to
point
out
this
proposition
to
this
court.
i
feel
that
judgment
must
be
reversed
whether
we
view
(inaudible)
case
through
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it's
in
the
stipulated
record,
mr.
justice
white,
and
it
is
--
and
admitted
in
the
state's
answering
brief.
i
believe
it
is
at
page
9
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
your
honor.
whether
we
approach
this
case
through
the
sixth
amendment
by
way
of
the
fourteenth
as
enforcing
the
sixth
amendment
the
right
to
compulsory
process,
directly
or
whether
we
approach
it
directly
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
result
should
be
the
same
as
the
right
to
a
witness
in
one's
behalf
particularly
a
witness
so
vital
as
here
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
pointed
out
in
palko
versus
connecticut.
this
question
has
been
settled
in
the
courts
of
appeal
where
it
has
arisen.
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
well-reasoned
opinion
has
held
in
effect
in
the
robinsons
versus
pate,
which
is
not
in
the
brief,
345
f.2d
691,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
that
in
the
wake
of
gideon
versus
wainwright,
or
pointer
versus
texas,
and
all
of
those
great
decisions
implicitly
holding
the
right
to
effective
counsel.
that
the
result
must
be
the
same
with
reference
to
compulsory
process,
that
it
is
implicit
in
any
concept
to
the
ordered
liberty
and
justice
whether
we
view
it
alone
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
we
view
it
that
that
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
incorporated
and
obligatory
on
the
states
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
interacting
with
the
sixth.
the
result
must
be
the
same.
now
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
compulsory
process.
the
right
to
compulsory
process;
to
make
a
fair
defense
is
a
concept
of
fundamental
justice
in
our
opinion
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
unreported
opinion
dated
february
the
15th
1967,
number
23803,
bonner
versus
beto
is
directly
in
point
with
this
case.
the
facts
are
critically
the
same.
in
that
particular
case,
the
same
statute,
article
711
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
was
applied.
the
petitioner
in
that
case,
the
appellant
in
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit,
have
tried
to
use
his
wife,
who
was
a
codefendant
who
had
been
tried
and
given
a
suspended
sentence
for
burglary.
her
testimony
would
have
been
that
he,
the
petitioner,
was
returning
the
stolen
goods
and
did
not
participate
in
the
burglary.
her
testimony
was
excluded.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
approached
this
problem
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
that
in
any
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
that
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
right
to
due
process
of
law,
apart
from
whether
the
sixth
amendment
is
incorporated
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
as
to
compulsory
process,
require
their
version
of
that
conviction.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
bonner
versus
beto.
the
result
is
the
same
in
that
case.
bonner
is
now
not
on
--
is
now
on
motion
for
rehearing,
i
am
advised
by
the
attorney
general's
department
of
texas.
the
result
in
bonner
versus
beto
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
result
in
robinson
versus
pate
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
the
robinson
v.
pate,
the
accused
person
in
which
he
called
two
witnesses
and
have
compulsory
process
who
could
have
testified
that
right
after
the
event,
he
was
acting
bizarre;
that
he
may
have
been
insane
to
lay
witness.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reached
the
result
to
applying
the
sixth
amendment
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth.
bonner
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
mr.
justice,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
the
failure
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
under
article
711
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
agree
with
that
to
this
extent.
he
was
available.
the
process
was
available.
the
process
was
used
but
its
effective
use
was
denied
by
the
particular
application
of
that
statute
to
this
petitioner
as
effectively
denied
as
if
there
were
no
law
required.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
unquestionably
so.
under
ferguson
against
georgia
as
pointed
out,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
a
concurring
opinion
that
the
georgia
statute
which
prohibited
the
testimony
of
a
defendant;
prohibited
his
being
sworn,
should
be
struck
down
even
though
petitioner
in
that
case
had
not
raised
the
point
below.
and
that
case
was
reversed
on
the
basis
that
the
amending
statute
did
not
permit
the
accused
counsel
to
question
this
man
and
making
a
statement
unsworn
before
the
jury.
and
that
that
in
effect
denied
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
clark's
view
that
the
whole
statute
was
unconstitutional
when
tested
and
measured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
agree
with
that.
yes,
this
is
a
bad
statute
but
i
would
say
that
texas
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
thank
you,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
say
that
we
have
recognized
the
error
of
our
ways
by
the
repeal
of
that
statute
but
i
would
further
say
in
candor
to
this
honorable
court
that
texas
can
make
rules
by
statute
or
otherwise
as
to
who
is
competent
as
a
witness
and
as
to
who
is
not.
but
here,
it
is
the
application
of
this
particular
statute,
not
necessarily
its
unconstitutionality
that
works
an
injustice
on
jackie
washington,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
now,
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
we
know
that
effective
assistance
of
the
denial
of
counsel
means
the
denial
of
effective
counsel.
that
was
the
decision
in
powell
against
alabama
upon
which
gideon
against
wainwright
was
decided.
i
would
further
like
to
point
out
to
this
honorable
court
the
concept
adhered.
this
is
a
particular
or
was
a
particularly
vicious
statute.
interest,
according
to
black
stone,
i
believe,
was
the
only
disqualification
of
parties
if
they
had
understanding
of
the
event
and
reason.
this
statute
as
the
holdover
of
the
old
dead
hand
of
the
common-law
and
as
opposed
to
public
policy
of
turning
on
all
possible
light
for
the
jury
and
let
them
assess
credibility.
but
our
statute
was
particularly
vicious
and
that
it
permitted
this
supposed
interested
witness,
the
codefendant,
to
testify
for
the
state
but
not
for
defendant.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
am
challenging
it,
mr.
justice
white
on
its
face
and
as
applied
here
also
and
whether
we
arrive
at
the
result
to
applying
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
compulsory
process
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
this
is
implicit
just
like
in
the
--
held
by
this
honorable
court
in
pointer
versus
texas.
they
are
the
holding
being
the
right
of
compensation
under
the
sixth
amendment
by
the
majority
would
be
applied
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
as
obligatory
on
the
state
of
texas.
alright
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
judging
the
statute,
perhaps
not
but
i
am
aware
of
the
harmless
error
rule
and
how
--
if
this
witness
have
no
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
could
have
helped
the
petitioner.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
record,
i
believe,
bears
us
out
as
to
what
he
would
testify
to
at
page
4,
your
honor,
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
approved
by
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
which
is
our
way
of
settling
the
appeals
sometime
from
the
points
and
when
approved
by
the
judge
and
accepted
as
qualified,
page
4
of
the
record,
that
is
controlling
even
over
the
statement
of
facts
under
texas
practice,
mr.
justice
white.
even
if
the
shorthand
reporter
had
it
different,
if
the
trial
judge
approves
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
the
facts
stated
therein,
it
controls
over
the
statement
of
facts.
and
the
honorable
judge
meath
(ph)
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
approved
that
bill
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
--
with
the
purported
evidence
which
would
have
been
exculpated
the
petitioner
had
it
been
believed.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses,
which
means
the
right
to
have
counsel
there
to
cross-examine,
is
intertwined
with
the
right
to
counsel
and
if
compulsory
process
is
necessary
to
get
the
witnesses
there
to
have
a
fair
trial,
then
it
is
just
as
implicit
in
any
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
the
right
of
confrontation
as
so
held
in
pointer
against
texas.
now,
as
to
the
results
in
this
case,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
we
approach
this
case
strictly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process,
the
right
to
be
heard,
the
right
to
make
a
fair
defense
as
applied
in
this
particular
case
or
whether
we
approach
it
that
the
sixth
amendment
provisions
of
the
right
to
compulsory
process
is
incorporated
and
obligatory
against
the
state
of
texas
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
i
feel
that
my
opponent,
by
reading
their
brief,
would
possibly
err
that
the
recent
opinion
of
spencer
against
texas
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
case.
i
seriously
challenge
that
position.
i
think
spencer
against
texas,
the
majority
opinion
simply
holds
that
where
element
is
relevant
to
a
conviction
under
the
prosecution
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute
that
where
a
relevant
evidence
is
admissible,
though
it
is
harmful
and
damaging
to
the
accused
it
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension.
why?
because
there
was
no
provision
pointed
out
in
spencer
against
texas.
implicitly
in
the
bill
of
rights,
there
was
no
ex
--
implicit
constitutional
provision
violated
in
spencer
against
texas
and
this
court
held
in
majority.
and
i
think
with
sound
reasoning,
with
all
due
difference
to
the
dissent
that
in
trials
of
this
nature,
some
prejudice
is
bound
to
occur
to
the
defendant
in
the
admission
of
relevant
testimony.
we
might
get
to
the
point
to
where
bloody
pictures
were
relevant
could
be
so
bad
that
the
accused
would
contend
they
violate
process.
but
i
think
that
here
we
have
a
horse
of
a
different
coat.
and
in
my
humble
opinion,
pointer
against
texas,
gideon
against
wainwright,
the
sound
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
robinson
v.
pate,
the
viciousness
of
this
statute
which
is
aimed
against,
but
which
says
the
man
is
not
interested,
the
codefendant
if
he
is
called
by
the
state
even
though
he
has
been
tried
and
convicted
or
untried,
that
he
can
testify.
but
the
only
way
the
defendant
under
that
statute
could
use
this
witness
was
to
make
a
false
accusation.
now
what
would
the
defendant
have
to
do
to
use
fuller,
the
codefendant.
he
would
have
to
file
a
false
affidavit
that
fuller
was
not
guilty
and
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
fuller,
and
that
fuller
should
be
first
tried.
then
and
only
then
if
fuller
was
tried
and
acquitted
could
petitioner
use
that
witness.because
--
not
make
this
false
affidavit,
fuller
was
guilty.
the
only
other
way
he
could
use
fuller's
evidence
was
this
--
was
if
the
state
of
texas
would
wait
50
years
or
until
the
man
was
released
and
had
satisfied
his
conviction
then
he
could
be
called
or
if
the
prosecution
were
dismissed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
perhaps
three
minutes
for
rejoinder.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
by
way
of
a
few
brief
concluding
remarks,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
only
a
few
states
prohibit
the
use
of
a
codefendant
at
this
time.
they're
listed
in
the
appendix
a
of
the
brief.
that's
alabama,
alaska,
kansas,
nebraska,
south
dakota,
texas,
and
wyoming.
i
do
believe
however
that
in
fundamental
fairness,
the
other
states
outside
of
my
home
state
texas
apply
the
rule
equally
against
the
state
and
against
the
defendant
in
prohibiting
the
competency
of
a
codefendant
as
a
witness.
with
reference
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it's
my
opinion,
that's
true
your
honor.
the
state
cannot
in
those
few
states,
not
--
neither
can
the
defendant.
but
in
texas,
the
state
may
call
the
accused
co-principal.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
to
my
knowledge
no
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
to
my
knowledge,
no
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
answer
to
counsel's
argument
about
the
record,
i
would
suggest
fuller
versus
the
state,
the
opinion
cited
in
our
brief.
the
codefendant
being
first
tried
as
to
whether
or
not
he
mislead
the
state.
his
confession
introduced
by
the
state.
he
stated
as
follows,
then
i
saw
a
man
come
out
on
--
of
the
house
on
the
porch.
this
is
codefendant
fuller
testifying
in
his
confession
used
for
the
state.
that's
when
i
shot
the
gun
one
time,
jackie
ran.
jackie
is
washington.
therefore
the
state
used
this
evidence,
(inaudible)
but
its
true
that
jackie
did
not
fire
the
gun
and
that
he
ran.
and
i
therefore
challenge
counsel's
remarks
about
perjury
and
what
had
happened
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that's
the
confession
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
fuller
did,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
admitted
that
in
the
trial
record
of
firing
a
shot,
he
simply
tried
to
justify
it
on
the
grounds
that
he
meant
to
frighten
and
did
not
intend
to
hit
the
deceased
when
he
came
on
the
front
porch,
when
he
fired
the
shotgun.
but
in
his
confession
made
shortly
after
arrest
used
for
the
state,
he
clearly
exonerated
our
client.
now,
i
think
all
agree
that
a
man
is
not
guilty
of
a
crime
by
being
physically
present
at
the
scene
unless
he
by
act,
word,
or
gesture
encourages
the
commission.
the
defense
withdrew
from
the
intention
and
the
plan
is
a
valid
defense
and
was
so
charged
by
the
jury
in
the
washington
case.
by
way
of
conclusion,
mr.
justice
harlan
pointedly
remarked
yesterday,
is
this
in
fact
a
compulsory
process
case?
i
would
say
yes.
i
disagree
with
the
attorney
general
of
texas
when
he
states
that
process
means
merely
getting
one
to
court.
i
think
the
effective
process
is
the
same
as
effective
counsel,
that
the
legitimate
ends
of
process
is
to
not
get
the
man
to
the
court
outdoor
and
stop
there
but
to
get
him
into
the
witness
box
where
he
can
tell
a
truthful
story.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
no
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
not
in
every
case.
i
would
say
that
compulsory
effective
process
means
where
the
evidence
is
legitimate,
where
it
is
being
applied
to
deny
the
truth.
here
the
petitioner
itself
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
very
true,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
that
the
application
in
a
given
case
might
fall.
my
point
would
be
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
we
approach
this
case
to
the
sixth
amendment
by
way
of
the
fourteenth
by
incorporation.
or
whether
we
approach
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone
because
in
any
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
the
precept
that
one
should
have
a
right
to
offer
the
truth
by
way
of
defense
is
a
valid
precept
in
law
and
one
that
should
be
enforced
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
answer
that
when
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
then
your
honor
i
would
argue
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
under
the
fundamental
fairness
doctrine
the
right
to
be
heard,
the
right
to
make
a
defense
in
court
that
certainly
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit
reasoned
in
bonner
v.
beto.
that
where
the
state
by
legislation
and
the
trial
judge
by
enforcing
the
state
statute
by
order
suppresses,
suppresses
evidence
showing
the
truth,
the
truth
of
the
accused
is
not
guilty,
then
certainly
the
principles
of
brady
against
maryland
should
be
brought
in
this
case.
and
therefore
the
conviction
would
be
just
as
invalid
where
the
state
legislature
suppresses
the
truth
by
statute.
and
the
trial
judge
enforced
it
from
as
if
the
prosecutor
or
the
attorney
general
of
texas
suppressed
evidence
knowingly
that
would
show
innocence
of
the
accused.
i
think
either
--
by
authority
of
brady
against
maryland
or
by
authority
of
pointer
against
texas
specifically
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process,
this
case
should
be
reversed.
as
pointed
out
in
the
ferguson
case
and
in
concluding,
that
where
a
truth
is
sought
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
shown
by
way
of
defense.
that
it
would
seem
that
any
bar
to
the
ascertainment
of
that
truth
which
is
not
reasonable
are
not
applied
to
both
parties
must
fall
as
was
said
in
the
ferguson
case.
the
indulgence
in
such
an
age
worn
time
disallowed
principle
would
be
to
go
backwards
into
the
past.
and
i
respectfully
submit
in
conclusion
that
this
case
must
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
there
are
some
circuit
court
of
appeals
cases
and
i
believe
theoni
(ph)
holds
that
and
also
robinson
versus
pate.
it
is
cladly
--
a
clad
holding
on
the
sixth
amendment
that
that
embodies
the
right
to
have
those
witnesses
in
the
witness
box.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
in
robinson,
he
had
asked
for
some
witnesses.
he
claimed
insanity
as
a
defense.
the
counsel
did
not
subpoena
the
two
lay
witnesses
who
saw
him
shortly
after
the
homicide.
and
as
a
result,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
in
the
wake
of
gideon
against
wainwright,
and
that
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment
means
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
is
very
true.
now
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well
of
course,
looking
at
the
federal
decisions
in
funk
versus
the
united
states,
i
believe
that
would
be
the
holding
in
that
case
where
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
common
law
rule
was
previously
that
a
wife
was
incompetent
to
testify
for
her
husband
because
of
interest.
the
funk
court
--
this
honorable
court
in
that
case
overruled
the
common
law
rule
in
the
light
of
human
experience
and
reason
permitting
the
testimony.
on
the
other
hand,
the
privilege
has
been
sustained.
i
believe
in
a
man,
that
prosecution
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
now
we
do
have
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
we
do
have
statutes
in
texas
that
waive
the
wife's
privilege
in
many
cases
not
to
be
called
by
the
state.
the
legislature
recently
passed
a
statute
holding
that
the
wife
in
incest
prosecutions
could
testify
even
though
normally
she
would
be
barred.
so
it's
a
matter
of
legislative
enactment.
i
wish
to
thank
this
honorable
court
for
hearing.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
certainly
not
your
honor.
the
rules
of
evidence
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
because
we
deal
with
rules
that
have
a
guarantee
of
truthfulness
to
it.
ours
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
unreliable.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
then
i
think
this
honorable
court
should
weigh
in
the
balance,
the
reason
for
it,
and
the
effectiveness
of
such
a
rule.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
particularly
the
rationale.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
to
this
extent
that
the
judgment
of
the
texas
legislature
and
the
enforcement
of
this
particular
statute,
allowing
the
prosecution
to
indict
those
they
think
are
involved
in
the
crime,
and
thereby
eliminate
every
possible
witness
that's
indicted
until
he's
tried
and
acquitted.
certainly
that
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
agree
they
could
certainly
do
that
mr.
justice
white
because
the
dying
declaration
is
statutory.
we
find
the
--
a
reason
that
it's
trustworthy
when
a
man's
dying.
and
he
says
somebody
shot
me.
hearsay
is
untrustworthy
but
we
permit
exceptions.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
outlaw
the
statute
if
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
would
outlaw
this
statute,
mr.
justice
white,
if
its
application
evolved
and
invoked
the
depravation
of
sixth
amendment
rights.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
say
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well,
first
of
all
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
answer
it
this
way.
the
credibility
as
for
the
jury,
as
triers
of
the
fact,
they
can
adjudge
the
credibility
of
the
codefendant
far
better
than
the
legislative.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
or
even
the
attorney
general
figures
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
subject
to
hearsay,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
feel
that
would
be
highly
unfair,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
we
do
not
prohibit
the
state
from
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
it's
the
law
in
our
courts
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
mr.
justice
stewart
since
time
immemorial,
our
courts
and
all
courts
of
law,
england
is
not
to
the
contrary,
have
recognized
the
most
intimate
relationship
in
the
world
as
man
and
wife.
and
that
anything
that
comes
between
what
god
has
joined
together,
they
must
follow
unless
there's
a
real
necessity
for
it.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
agree
with
that
and
i
certainly
think
it
must
face
the
balancing
of
interest
test
just
like
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
prosecution
from
calling
the
defendant
and
ascertaining
truth.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
certainly,
but
we
must
here
balance
the
rights
involved
which
is
more
important
to
fifth,
the
fourteenth
and
the
sixth
where
they
conflict.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
certainly
think
so
and
i
think
it
would
go
back
to
a
fundamental
fair
right
to
trial
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
of
course,
the
hearsay
rule
has
no
application
except
for
the
matters
offered
to
prove
the
truth
thereof.
secondly
i
would
say
that
the
hearsay
rule
is
valid
and
reasonable.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
out
of
court
statements
made
without
the
sanction
of
both
which
you're
offered
to
prove
that
that
statement
is
true
and
made
without
the
right
of
confrontation
of
that
hearsay
witness,
and
made
without
the
right
to
cross-examine
that
hearsay
witness
would
certainly
be
violative
of
due
process.
certainly
if
there's
a
valid
reason
for
it
because
we
just
said
in
pointer
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
it
is
heard
without
confrontation
as
in
pointer
and
without
the
right
to
effective
counsel
to
cross-examine
that
hearsay
declarant
who
made
the
statement
out
of
court.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
is
very
true.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
there
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
there
were
only
two
witnesses
in
the
world
who
knew
what
happened.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
your
honor,
there's
some
colloquy
in
the
record
about
objections.
the
citation
is
397
s.w.
2d,
south
western
reporter
second
at
page
434
wherein
the
state
used
fuller's
confession
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
what
happened.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor
and
verbatim
in
toto.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
is
our
offer
of
proof.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
in
the
settled
bill
of
exception.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor
and
that
is
corroborated
by
the
full
confession
of
fuller
set
out,
offered
at
his
preliminary
trial.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
so
the
state
had
knowledge
of
this.
they
used
it.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
with
this
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
on
the
sixth
amendment
with
this
exception
mr.
justice
white.
and
that
is
that
if
the
rule
were
applied
equally
against
the
state
and
the
defendant
equally,
that
neither
one
could
use
him.
and
if
the
rule
as
i
believe
it
to
be
in
some
of
those
states
is
that
after
trial
of
the
other
man,
he
has
no
interest
whether
he's
convicted
or
whether
he's
acquitted,
then
from
many
of
those
states
permit
him
to
testify.
we
don't.
we'd
have
to
wait
50
years.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
by
virtue
of
the
concurring
opinion
in
ferguson
against
georgia,
i
would
agree
wholeheartedly
with
that
concurrence
that
that
statute
should
fall.
justice
--
some
of
the
justices
felt
that
the
article
40,
416,
georgia
code
should
fall
even
though
there
was
no
objection
in
the
trial
court
to
not
being
sworn.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
agree
with
that
to
some
extent,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
would
say
that
--
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
balancing,
i
would
say
that
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
somewhat
relative
and
this
is
something
that
you
couldn't
automatically
say
work
the
constitutional
deprivation
whether
it
was
six
months
or
three
months
or
a
year.
certainly,
it's
not
as
strong
as
pointer
confrontation,
cross-examination,
and
compulsory
process.
thank
you
very
much.
