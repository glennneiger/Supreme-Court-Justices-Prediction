mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
start
to
--
get
the
ground
rule
straight
here.
i
understood
from
the
papers
we
had
all
filed
that
we
will
here
today
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
right
to
compulsory
production
witnesses
was
to
be
discuss
here.
and
i
hope
i'm
prepared
to
discuss
that
point.
i'm
not
so
well
prepared
to
simply
go
into
general
rules
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
my
instructions
from
this
court
whether
to
respond
on
that
basis.
and
i
don't
feel
that
compulsory
process
has
meant
to
violate
it
at
all.
the
witness
that
he
wanted
was
available
right
there
in
the
dallas
county
jail
and
could
have
been
used
at
any
time.
he
did
not
issue
a
subpoena
and
the
sheriff
refused
to
serve
it.
the
man
was
there
available
but
he
was
prevented
by
an
evidentiary
rule.
he
was
an
incompetent
witness
in
the
same
manner
as
an
idiot,
a
lunatic,
or
a
drunkard.
because
our
state
law
says
that
he
was
an
incompetent
witness.
and
i
don't
think
that
rule
would
mean
any
different
if
he
had
issued
a
subpoena
and
brought
immediately
into
the
court
and
the
state
objected
to
the
testimony
of
an
idiot
or
lunatic.
and
the
court
had,
right
properly
under
the
statutes,
excluded
such
testimony.
as
true,
the
idiot
may
have
been
a
witness.
he
may
have
been
sitting
around
somewhere
where
he
could
see
what
was
going
on.
but
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
failure
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
provide
him
with
compulsory
process
just
because
the
court
said
that
idiot
cannot
testify.
in
this
instance
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
doubt
it.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
i'm
not
going
to
answer
(inaudible)
because
i
haven't
studied
the
question,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
mean,
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well,
i
feel
that
at
least
there
are
some
reason
for
saying
that
idiots
and
lunatics
can't
testify,
your
honor
and
i
felt
that
there
was
and
still
could
be
ample
reason
for
saying
that
a
codefendant
has
such
an
interest
in
the
outcome
or
he's
so
likely
to
lie
as
to
be
unreliable
and
therefore
they
will
not
permit
him
to
testify.
it's
true
that
we
have
changed
our
rules
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
he
cannot
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
testify
for
anybody
under
the
new
rule.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
under
our
current
--
under
our
new
code
of
criminal
procedure,
the
can
testify
for
anybody.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
by
the
rule
as
they
exist
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
he
could
be
called
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
do
you
want
me
to
continue
now,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
and
it
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
sometimes
do,
and
sometimes
don't.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
it's
much
the
same
way
that
you
can't
--
that
a
man
--
we
can't
call
a
man's
wife
to
testify
against
him
but
he
can
call
his
wife
to
testify
in
court.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
he
qualifies
as
an
idiot,
he
can't
testify
for
his
side.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
only
insofar
as
both
have
been
fallen
within
the
rule
that
prohibits
their
testimony.
yes.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
thank
you.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
occasion
of
adjournment
yesterday,
there
was
a
discussion
going
on
concerning
the
parallel
i
was
drawing
between
a
statute
which
prohibits
lunatics,
and
idiots,
drunkards,
from
testifying
in
the
statute
in
this
instance
which
prohibits
a
codefendant
from
testifying.
in
order
to
give
you
the
example
of
why
i
think
parallel
was
well
drawn
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
review
briefly
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case
although
i
dont
think
they're
entirely
necessary
to
a
determination
question.
nevertheless
counsel
yesterday
in
his
argument
indicated
that
if
the
codefendant
had
been
allowed
to
testify
that
he
would
exonerate
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
petitioner,
a
young
man
who
went
around
and
gathered
up
a
gang,
he
was
searching
for
a
gun.
he
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
his
drunken
codefendant,
placed
the
rest
of
his
gang
around
the
house
to
throw
rocks
at
the
house
to
bring
someone
to
the
front
door.
and
apparently
at
that
time
he
lost
his
courage.
and
according
to
his
testimony
and
according
to
the
affidavit
of
the
codefendant,
the
last
minute,
he
turned
and
ran.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
he'd
be
perfectly
guilty
as
a
principle
even
though
he
did
lose
his
courage
and
ran
at
the
last
minute.
he
started
the
whole
thing
going.
he
organized
the
expedition.
he
was
the
general
that
laid
down
the
plan
of
action
and
was
therefore
completely
culpable
for
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
oh,
to
the
purpose
of
shooting
him
your
honor
and
actually,
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
him.
at
the
trial,
they
naturally
claim
that
they
were
just
trying
to
fight.
the
deceased
had
been
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
the
deceased
had
been
running
around
with
the
petitioner's
girlfriend,
age
16.
and
some
bad
blood
had
arisen
between
them
and
he
went
around
and
said
he
was
going
to
go
there
and
shoot
him.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
girl.
the
girlfriend
was
--
the
others
were
in
there
17,
18-year
old
bracket.
and
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
50
years.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
--
at
that
time,
under
a
single
hearing,
the
jury
found
guilt
or
innocence
and
fixed
the
punishment.
under
our
new
code,
guilt
or
innocence
is
first
determined
except
in
murder
--
in
capital
cases
which
still
continue
that
way.
so
the
jury
under
the
present
system
still
fixes
both
in
capital
cases
which
murder
is.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that's
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
he
so
testified
the
testimony
was
before
the
jury.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
and
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
if
he
had
competent
witnesses
to
corroborate,
yes
he
would
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
but
in
this
instance
he
--
the
other
--
the
witness
that
he
called
for
was
not
competent
to
testify
under
state
law.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
and
because
the
statute
specifically
prohibited
codefendants
from
testifying
for
one
or
another
at
that
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
(inaudible)
got
50
years,
your
honor.
and
i
might
add
that
the
--
in
an
examination
of
the
record
here
you
will
see
that
the
codefendant
at
the
time
of
his
trial
was
trying
to
lay
it
all
on
the
petitioner.
the
affidavit
of
the
codefendant
according
to
the
statements
of
attorneys
in
the
--
in
our
transcript
here,
he
was
switching
around
and
after
he
gotten
his
50
years,
which
we
feel
is
the
perfect
justification
for
the
legislature
adopting
this
rule.
that
is
to
having
been
convicted,
given
his
50
years
then
the
codefendant
fuller
was
going
to
turn
around
and
switch
his
story.
and
it's
not
adequate
to
say
that
perjury
can
be
brought
because
as
this
court
well
knows
conflicts
and
statements
do
not
necessarily
support
perjury.
first
place
we'd
have
to
prove
at
which
time
the
man
was
lying.
but
he
obviously
was
changing
his
story
from
the
time
of
his
trial
when
he
was
putting
on
the
petitioner
that
is
the
codefendant
fuller
was
changing
his
story
from
the
time
of
his
own
trial
to
the
time
of
this
trial.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
cannot
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
my
explanation
to
that
your
honor
is
that
the
--
if
the
prosecutor
in
interrogating
these
people
as
prospect
to
witnesses,
unless
he
should
make
some
improper
promise
and
of
course
that
would
invalidate
any
witness'
testimony.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it'd
be
a
subject
(voice
overlap)
--
it
will
be
subject
to
attack,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
but
assuming
no
improper
inducement
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
if
one
codefendant
is
willing
to
turn
states
evidence,
the
prosecutor
is
privileged
to
use
it.
and
i
think
that
is
a
practice
that
is
followed
in
states
whether
or
not
they
have
such
a
statute
as
texas
has.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
natural
tendency
to
be
more
truthful
when
you
are
making
incriminating
statements
about
a
friend
and
then
if
you
are
making
statements
in
his
support
which
i
think
is
a
natural
human
tendency.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
to
be
truthful
in
his
accusation
than
to
necessarily
be
truthful
in
his
effort
to
gain
freedom
for
his
friend.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that
is
possibly
true
but
at
the
same
time
if
the
codefendant
is
subject
to
acquittal,
the
severance
statutes
which
were
mentioned
yesterday
permit
either
of
two
codefendants
to
file
a
motion
for
severance
and
to
require
the
trial
of
the
other
man
first
so
that
he
may
establish
his
innocence
and
thereby
become
a
free
agent
and
competent
witness
for
the
codefendant.
in
this
instance
the
--
fuller
was
tried
first,
convicted
and
given
50
years.
the
state
felt
that
it
would
avail
them
nothing
in
the
way
of
seeking
the
truth
of
this
story
to
put
him
on
the
stand.
and
in
accordance
with
the
statute
opposed
he's
getting
on
the
stand.
this
has
been
the
ruling
of
texas
for
time
immemorial
and
many
other
states
have
had
this
rule.
some
use
--
still
retain
the
rule
that
prohibits
codefendants
from
testifying
for
one
another.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
every
prosecutor
in
the
state
is
asking
that
same
question.
all
i
can
say
is
we,
we
have
to
live
with
it
now.
we
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
we
have
lost
a
great
many
of
our
tools.
we
still
try
to
go
on.
i
don't
believe
it
was
necessarily
required
but
in
the
sweeping
revision
of
our
code
of
criminal
procedure,
this
was
included
as
one
of
the
changes
that
the
legislature
brought
about.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
presumed
--
presume
so
your
honor
but
i'd
--
i
would
like
to
add
that
i
don't
feel
the
mere
fact
that
the
legislature
has
now
changed
the
statute
would
necessarily
reflect
that
the
prior
statute
was
bad
just
as
our
changing
from
a
single
hearing
wherein
guilt
and
innocence
and
punishment
were
determined
to
stage
hearing.
there's
not
in
my
mind
necessarily
mean
that
the
single
hearing
was
bad.
and
in
this
instance
i
feel
it's
just
a
change
that
has
come
about
with
the
changing
times.
but
i
still
don't
feel
that
that
should
be
any
indictment
of
our
former
system.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
can't
name
them
right
now
but
i'd
be
glad
to
furnish
them
to
the
court.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
of
course,
georgia
if
you'll
recall
until
this
court
acted,
even
prevented
the
defendant
from
taking
the
stand
at
one
time.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
but
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
under
the
common
law
rule
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that's
true
and
also
there
was
a
common
law
rule
that
developed
this
rule
originally
and
the
common
law
has
been
changed.
then
most
--
and
the
principle
authority
cited
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
the
funk
case
goes
into
that
but
i
don't
think
it's
authority
for
what
we're
considering
here
today
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
the
funk
case
was
an
effort
to
define
or
redefine
the
common
law
because
it
was
a
federal
trial
and
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
apply
the
common
law
of
the
state
in
determining
their
procedure.
but
it
--
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
authority
for
overwriting
the
statute
because
this
court
in
writing
in
funk
each
time
that
they
mention
the
change
always
added
a
proviso
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action
or
in
the
absence
of
legislative
statement
whereas
in
our
case,
we
have
a
statute.
there
was
no
question
of
the
common
law
being
applied
in
this
texas
trial.
the
only
place
is
whether
or
not
our
statute
is
valid
as
it
appears
to
be
for
quite
sometime.
now,
i
would
like
to
once
again
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
mention
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
feel
that
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
guarantees
to
every
person
who
is
going
to
have
to
stand
trial
that
any
witness
that
is
available
in
his
favor
will
be
brought
into
the
court.
in
other
words
you
cannot
deny
him
the
right
to
have
his
witnesses
present.
in
this
instance,
the
witness
was
available.
there's
no
question
about
that.
he
was
right
there
at
the
dallas
county
jail
and
the
court
had
to
control
all
remedy;
he
was
admitted
that
although
he
was
not
put
on
the
stand
because
of
the
objection
that
he
was
available
and
could
have
been
put
on
the
stand.
the
state
cannot
deny
a
man
the
right
to
have
a
sheriff
go
out
and
get
the
defendant's
witnesses
in
just
the
same
way
that
he
will
go
out
and
get
the
state's
witnesses.
that
to
me
is
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
but
in
this
instance
the
man
was
disqualified.
and
i
feel
that
you're
in
the
same
position
as
you
would
be
if
you
brought
a
man
in
by
compulsory
process.
and
a
motion
was
filed
by
the
state
to
prohibit
his
testimony
on
the
grounds
that
he
knew
nothing
but
hearsay
testimony,
and
therefore
could
have
no
possible
basis
for
testifying.
and
if
at
a
hearing
on
the
motion
in
limine,
the
court
determined
that
the
witness
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
facts
of
the
case
except
something
that
he
had
heard.
the
court
did
properly
exclude
the
testimony
of
that
witness
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
disqualified
by
a
reason
of
lack
of
knowledge.
that
would
not
deny
the
man
compulsory
process
to
bring
his
witness
in.
it
will
only
bar
the
witness
from
testifying
after
he
arrives
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
would
presume
that
such
a
statute
would
be
subject
to
attack
even
though
i
don't
--
i
can't
reasonably
expect
a
legislature
in
its
wisdom
to
pass
such
a
statute.
nonetheless,
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
attack
for
the
reason
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
on
the
ground
that
that
would
deny
a
man
a
fair
trial
without
reason.
that
it
would
be
outside
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
prevent
anyone
from
testifying.
whereas
i
do
not
believe
that
the
prohibition
of
a
codefendant
is
arbitrary
or
capricious
but
rather
that
it's
based
in
sound
judgment
although
the
judgment
has
now
been
changed.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i
think
by
the
same
token
if
it
bars
that,
it
would
also
bar
their
right
to
exclude
idiots,
lunatics,
and
drunkards
which
is
why
i
brought
it
up
yesterday.
there
would
be
no
end
to
it
if
you
can't
bring
in
--
i
mean
if
you
can't
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
exclude
one
man
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
then
you
get
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
neither
party
can
use
it
if
the
other
party
objects
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir
but
this
is
just
like
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
put
his
wife
on
the
stand
in
his
behalf.
but
the
state
may
not
call
the
defendant's
wife
in
his
behalf.
and
i
presume
that
if
our
present
ruling
failed
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it
also
our
statute
prohibiting
wives
from
testifying
against
their
husbands
would
fall
for
the
same
reason,
mr.
justice
black.
and
yet
i've
never
had
any
quarrel
with
the
statute.
i've
never
felt
that
we
should
attempt
to
force
wives
to
testify
against
their
husbands.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
we
don't
bar
them,
mr.
justice
black.
the
statute
says
that
the
state
cannot
call
the
defendant's
wife
and
force
her
to
testify
against
him.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
would
not
see
any
connection
there,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
there's
a
connection
between
the
man
and
his
wife,
but
i
see
no
connection
unless
it
would
be
an
illicit
one
between
him
and
another
man's
wife.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
frankly
don't
know
whether
the
privilege
would
extend
to
other
principles
or
not,
i
read
of
that.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well,
i
don't
think
if
the
constitution
under
the
sixth
amendment
should
extend
to
prohibit
--
i
mean
to
permit
a
man's
wife
to
be
forced
to
testify
against
their
husband.
and
i
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
i
don't
--
but
i
think
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i'm
sure
there
is
because
the
bill
of
rights
specifically
says
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
whereas
the
state
doesn't
get
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i'm
sorry
but
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
relative
difference
between
what
the
state
can
do
and
what
the
defendant
can
do
in
this
case.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
works
the
other
way.
and
i
believe
that
compulsory
process
is
available.
it
should
be
available
to
both
sides.
i
don't
know
whether
the
states
got
a
bill
of
rights
or
not
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
analogous,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
frankly
i
would
hope
that
it
applied
to
the
states
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
having
brought
in
the
rest
that
we
might
as
well
let
the
witness
clause
with
him
in
the
compulsory
process?
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
questions
whether
the
compulsory
process
clause
is
applicable.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
frankly
i
couldn't
find
any
but
i
just
assumed
that
since
the
hair
goes
with
the
hide
that
that
section
would
go
with
the
others
in
being
applicable
to
the
state.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
sometimes
the
hair
gets
burned
off,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
don't
necessarily
to
want
everybody.
i'm
just
not
going
to
fight
that
point
sir.
i
would
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
event
that
the
court
does
overturn
this
conviction
that
you
might
well
take
into
consideration
the
same
matter
that
you
did
in
the
case
of
reid
versus
plato
when
we
had
our
three
habitual
criminal
arguments
here
last
fall.
in
the
reid
case,
the
question
retroactivity
arose.
i'm
sure
that
there
are
great
many
prisoners
in
the
state
penitentiary
in
texas
right
now
who
in
one
way
or
another
would
claim
that
they
were
denied
the
right
to
call
a
codefendant.
these
are
men
whose
cases
have
long
since
been
put
to
rest.
their
time
for
--
neither
they
took
their
appeal
or
their
time
for
appeal
has
long
since
expired.
it
would
occur
to
me
that
in
the
event
you
do
overturn
this
that
you
might
put
sometime
limitation
as
you
have
done
in
some
of
your
recent
decisions
so
that
we
would
not
be
faced
with
a
substantial
number
of
applications
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
our
federal
courts
seeking
to
reopen
these
cases
on
this
basis.
i
would
hate
to
have
to
take
on
a
new
set
of
cases
because
we've
got
enough
to
say
grace
over
down
there
now.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no
sir.
it
applies
where
the
--
where
indictments
arise
out
of
the
same
offense,
essentially
the
same
set
of
facts.
we
do
not
often
jointly
indict
in
texas
because
of
the
procedural
difficulties
that
arise
from
joint
trials
under
our
statutes.
it
is
more
normal
to
return
single
indictments
and
then
we
occasionally
join
them
together
for
trial
unless
there
is
a
motion
for
severance
filed.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
can
go
even
further
if
you
pardon
me
for
testifying
outside
the
record
and
said
i
have
permitted
litigations
that
i
have
prosecuted.
it
can
be
waived.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
and
has
been
waived,
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well,
they
call
the
witness
in
the
state
objected
so
there
was
no
question
to
waiver.
the
state
affirmatively
objected
when
the
witness
was
called
by
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
--
petitioner.
but
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
just
simply
didn't
think
it
was
going
to
particularly
hurt
my
case.
i
thought
i
might
get
something
out
of
him
on
cross-examination
that
i
wouldn't
direct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i
say
when
i
don't
think
they'll
be
a
detriment
to
the
state.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
statute
has
been
changed.
that
was
effective
january
1st,
1966,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
very
little
appellate
experience
yet.
they've
had
some
experience
down
in
the
district
court
but
not
on
our
system.
not
many
cases
have
yet
gotten
up
to
the
appellate
court
where
this
been
done.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
just
in
talking
to
other
prosecutors
at
our
various
meetings,
i've
gotten
the
impression
that
it
has
been
tried
several
times
than
as
you
say
it
has
had
variable
results.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
frankly
would
welcome
the
opportunity
open
to
cross-examine
the
man
that
i
would
hesitate
to
put
on
the
stand
and
vouch
for
myself
but
i
don't
--
i
can't
give
you
any
statistics
on
it
sir.
i
notice
that
my
time
is
drawing
to
a
close.
i
would
like
to
simply
remind
the
court
one
more
time
that
this
is
a
hearing
under
the
sixth
amendment
with
regard
to
compulsory
process.
and
the
state
was
made
by
the
counsel,
that
spencer,
reid
and
belle
were
affirmed
by
this
court
on
the
basis
that
no
specific
provision
the
constitution
was
violated.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
was
available
in
the
courthouse
and
was
only
prohibited
from
testifying
by
the
state
statute,
i
would
like
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
principles
enunciated
in
spencer,
reid,
and
belle,
would
be
applicable
here
because
no
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
has
been
violated.
the
compulsion
of
the
attendants
of
witnesses
in
my
view
point
was
not
denied
to
this
man.
the
testimony
was
denied
to
him
under
the
statute
after
the
witness
had
been
made
physically
available
to
him.
the
mention
of
bonner
versus
beto
which
is
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
has
to
do
with
the
husband
and
wife
relationship
and
the
denial
of
her
testimony
under
similar
circumstances
where
she
was
a
co-indictee
is
under
motion
for
rehearing
by
our
office.
and
if
we
lose
there,
we're
going
to
ask
you
all
to
review
it
unless
you
little
too
adversely
in
this
case
and
we
consider
it
ill-advised
to
do
so.
but
it
has
not
been
finally
decided
at
this
point.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
start
to
--
get
the
ground
rule
straight
here.
i
understood
from
the
papers
we
had
all
filed
that
we
will
here
today
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
right
to
compulsory
production
witnesses
was
to
be
discuss
here.
and
i
hope
i'm
prepared
to
discuss
that
point.
i'm
not
so
well
prepared
to
simply
go
into
general
rules
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
my
instructions
from
this
court
whether
to
respond
on
that
basis.
and
i
don't
feel
that
compulsory
process
has
meant
to
violate
it
at
all.
the
witness
that
he
wanted
was
available
right
there
in
the
dallas
county
jail
and
could
have
been
used
at
any
time.
he
did
not
issue
a
subpoena
and
the
sheriff
refused
to
serve
it.
the
man
was
there
available
but
he
was
prevented
by
an
evidentiary
rule.
he
was
an
incompetent
witness
in
the
same
manner
as
an
idiot,
a
lunatic,
or
a
drunkard.
because
our
state
law
says
that
he
was
an
incompetent
witness.
and
i
don't
think
that
rule
would
mean
any
different
if
he
had
issued
a
subpoena
and
brought
immediately
into
the
court
and
the
state
objected
to
the
testimony
of
an
idiot
or
lunatic.
and
the
court
had,
right
properly
under
the
statutes,
excluded
such
testimony.
as
true,
the
idiot
may
have
been
a
witness.
he
may
have
been
sitting
around
somewhere
where
he
could
see
what
was
going
on.
but
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
failure
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
provide
him
with
compulsory
process
just
because
the
court
said
that
idiot
cannot
testify.
in
this
instance
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
doubt
it.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
i'm
not
going
to
answer
(inaudible)
because
i
haven't
studied
the
question,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
mean,
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well,
i
feel
that
at
least
there
are
some
reason
for
saying
that
idiots
and
lunatics
can't
testify,
your
honor
and
i
felt
that
there
was
and
still
could
be
ample
reason
for
saying
that
a
codefendant
has
such
an
interest
in
the
outcome
or
he's
so
likely
to
lie
as
to
be
unreliable
and
therefore
they
will
not
permit
him
to
testify.
it's
true
that
we
have
changed
our
rules
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
sir.
he
cannot
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
testify
for
anybody
under
the
new
rule.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
under
our
current
--
under
our
new
code
of
criminal
procedure,
the
can
testify
for
anybody.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
by
the
rule
as
they
exist
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
he
could
be
called
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
do
you
want
me
to
continue
now,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
and
it
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
sometimes
do,
and
sometimes
don't.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes,
it's
much
the
same
way
that
you
can't
--
that
a
man
--
we
can't
call
a
man's
wife
to
testify
against
him
but
he
can
call
his
wife
to
testify
in
court.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
he
qualifies
as
an
idiot,
he
can't
testify
for
his
side.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
only
insofar
as
both
have
been
fallen
within
the
rule
that
prohibits
their
testimony.
yes.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
thank
you.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
occasion
of
adjournment
yesterday,
there
was
a
discussion
going
on
concerning
the
parallel
i
was
drawing
between
a
statute
which
prohibits
lunatics,
and
idiots,
drunkards,
from
testifying
in
the
statute
in
this
instance
which
prohibits
a
codefendant
from
testifying.
in
order
to
give
you
the
example
of
why
i
think
parallel
was
well
drawn
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
review
briefly
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case
although
i
dont
think
they're
entirely
necessary
to
a
determination
question.
nevertheless
counsel
yesterday
in
his
argument
indicated
that
if
the
codefendant
had
been
allowed
to
testify
that
he
would
exonerate
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
petitioner,
a
young
man
who
went
around
and
gathered
up
a
gang,
he
was
searching
for
a
gun.
he
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
his
drunken
codefendant,
placed
the
rest
of
his
gang
around
the
house
to
throw
rocks
at
the
house
to
bring
someone
to
the
front
door.
and
apparently
at
that
time
he
lost
his
courage.
and
according
to
his
testimony
and
according
to
the
affidavit
of
the
codefendant,
the
last
minute,
he
turned
and
ran.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
he'd
be
perfectly
guilty
as
a
principle
even
though
he
did
lose
his
courage
and
ran
at
the
last
minute.
he
started
the
whole
thing
going.
he
organized
the
expedition.
he
was
the
general
that
laid
down
the
plan
of
action
and
was
therefore
completely
culpable
for
the
death
of
the
deceased
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
oh,
to
the
purpose
of
shooting
him
your
honor
and
actually,
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
him.
at
the
trial,
they
naturally
claim
that
they
were
just
trying
to
fight.
the
deceased
had
been
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
the
deceased
had
been
running
around
with
the
petitioner's
girlfriend,
age
16.
and
some
bad
blood
had
arisen
between
them
and
he
went
around
and
said
he
was
going
to
go
there
and
shoot
him.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
girl.
the
girlfriend
was
--
the
others
were
in
there
17,
18-year
old
bracket.
and
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
50
years.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
--
at
that
time,
under
a
single
hearing,
the
jury
found
guilt
or
innocence
and
fixed
the
punishment.
under
our
new
code,
guilt
or
innocence
is
first
determined
except
in
murder
--
in
capital
cases
which
still
continue
that
way.
so
the
jury
under
the
present
system
still
fixes
both
in
capital
cases
which
murder
is.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that's
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
he
so
testified
the
testimony
was
before
the
jury.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
and
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
if
he
had
competent
witnesses
to
corroborate,
yes
he
would
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
but
in
this
instance
he
--
the
other
--
the
witness
that
he
called
for
was
not
competent
to
testify
under
state
law.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
and
because
the
statute
specifically
prohibited
codefendants
from
testifying
for
one
or
another
at
that
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
(inaudible)
got
50
years,
your
honor.
and
i
might
add
that
the
--
in
an
examination
of
the
record
here
you
will
see
that
the
codefendant
at
the
time
of
his
trial
was
trying
to
lay
it
all
on
the
petitioner.
the
affidavit
of
the
codefendant
according
to
the
statements
of
attorneys
in
the
--
in
our
transcript
here,
he
was
switching
around
and
after
he
gotten
his
50
years,
which
we
feel
is
the
perfect
justification
for
the
legislature
adopting
this
rule.
that
is
to
having
been
convicted,
given
his
50
years
then
the
codefendant
fuller
was
going
to
turn
around
and
switch
his
story.
and
it's
not
adequate
to
say
that
perjury
can
be
brought
because
as
this
court
well
knows
conflicts
and
statements
do
not
necessarily
support
perjury.
first
place
we'd
have
to
prove
at
which
time
the
man
was
lying.
but
he
obviously
was
changing
his
story
from
the
time
of
his
trial
when
he
was
putting
on
the
petitioner
that
is
the
codefendant
fuller
was
changing
his
story
from
the
time
of
his
own
trial
to
the
time
of
this
trial.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
cannot
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
my
explanation
to
that
your
honor
is
that
the
--
if
the
prosecutor
in
interrogating
these
people
as
prospect
to
witnesses,
unless
he
should
make
some
improper
promise
and
of
course
that
would
invalidate
any
witness'
testimony.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
it'd
be
a
subject
(voice
overlap)
--
it
will
be
subject
to
attack,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
but
assuming
no
improper
inducement
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
if
one
codefendant
is
willing
to
turn
states
evidence,
the
prosecutor
is
privileged
to
use
it.
and
i
think
that
is
a
practice
that
is
followed
in
states
whether
or
not
they
have
such
a
statute
as
texas
has.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
natural
tendency
to
be
more
truthful
when
you
are
making
incriminating
statements
about
a
friend
and
then
if
you
are
making
statements
in
his
support
which
i
think
is
a
natural
human
tendency.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
to
be
truthful
in
his
accusation
than
to
necessarily
be
truthful
in
his
effort
to
gain
freedom
for
his
friend.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that
is
possibly
true
but
at
the
same
time
if
the
codefendant
is
subject
to
acquittal,
the
severance
statutes
which
were
mentioned
yesterday
permit
either
of
two
codefendants
to
file
a
motion
for
severance
and
to
require
the
trial
of
the
other
man
first
so
that
he
may
establish
his
innocence
and
thereby
become
a
free
agent
and
competent
witness
for
the
codefendant.
in
this
instance
the
--
fuller
was
tried
first,
convicted
and
given
50
years.
the
state
felt
that
it
would
avail
them
nothing
in
the
way
of
seeking
the
truth
of
this
story
to
put
him
on
the
stand.
and
in
accordance
with
the
statute
opposed
he's
getting
on
the
stand.
this
has
been
the
ruling
of
texas
for
time
immemorial
and
many
other
states
have
had
this
rule.
some
use
--
still
retain
the
rule
that
prohibits
codefendants
from
testifying
for
one
another.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
mr.
chief
justice,
every
prosecutor
in
the
state
is
asking
that
same
question.
all
i
can
say
is
we,
we
have
to
live
with
it
now.
we
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
we
have
lost
a
great
many
of
our
tools.
we
still
try
to
go
on.
i
don't
believe
it
was
necessarily
required
but
in
the
sweeping
revision
of
our
code
of
criminal
procedure,
this
was
included
as
one
of
the
changes
that
the
legislature
brought
about.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
presumed
--
presume
so
your
honor
but
i'd
--
i
would
like
to
add
that
i
don't
feel
the
mere
fact
that
the
legislature
has
now
changed
the
statute
would
necessarily
reflect
that
the
prior
statute
was
bad
just
as
our
changing
from
a
single
hearing
wherein
guilt
and
innocence
and
punishment
were
determined
to
stage
hearing.
there's
not
in
my
mind
necessarily
mean
that
the
single
hearing
was
bad.
and
in
this
instance
i
feel
it's
just
a
change
that
has
come
about
with
the
changing
times.
but
i
still
don't
feel
that
that
should
be
any
indictment
of
our
former
system.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
can't
name
them
right
now
but
i'd
be
glad
to
furnish
them
to
the
court.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
of
course,
georgia
if
you'll
recall
until
this
court
acted,
even
prevented
the
defendant
from
taking
the
stand
at
one
time.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
but
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
under
the
common
law
rule
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
that's
true
and
also
there
was
a
common
law
rule
that
developed
this
rule
originally
and
the
common
law
has
been
changed.
then
most
--
and
the
principle
authority
cited
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
the
funk
case
goes
into
that
but
i
don't
think
it's
authority
for
what
we're
considering
here
today
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
the
funk
case
was
an
effort
to
define
or
redefine
the
common
law
because
it
was
a
federal
trial
and
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
apply
the
common
law
of
the
state
in
determining
their
procedure.
but
it
--
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
authority
for
overwriting
the
statute
because
this
court
in
writing
in
funk
each
time
that
they
mention
the
change
always
added
a
proviso
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action
or
in
the
absence
of
legislative
statement
whereas
in
our
case,
we
have
a
statute.
there
was
no
question
of
the
common
law
being
applied
in
this
texas
trial.
the
only
place
is
whether
or
not
our
statute
is
valid
as
it
appears
to
be
for
quite
sometime.
now,
i
would
like
to
once
again
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
mention
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
feel
that
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
guarantees
to
every
person
who
is
going
to
have
to
stand
trial
that
any
witness
that
is
available
in
his
favor
will
be
brought
into
the
court.
in
other
words
you
cannot
deny
him
the
right
to
have
his
witnesses
present.
in
this
instance,
the
witness
was
available.
there's
no
question
about
that.
he
was
right
there
at
the
dallas
county
jail
and
the
court
had
to
control
all
remedy;
he
was
admitted
that
although
he
was
not
put
on
the
stand
because
of
the
objection
that
he
was
available
and
could
have
been
put
on
the
stand.
the
state
cannot
deny
a
man
the
right
to
have
a
sheriff
go
out
and
get
the
defendant's
witnesses
in
just
the
same
way
that
he
will
go
out
and
get
the
state's
witnesses.
that
to
me
is
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
but
in
this
instance
the
man
was
disqualified.
and
i
feel
that
you're
in
the
same
position
as
you
would
be
if
you
brought
a
man
in
by
compulsory
process.
and
a
motion
was
filed
by
the
state
to
prohibit
his
testimony
on
the
grounds
that
he
knew
nothing
but
hearsay
testimony,
and
therefore
could
have
no
possible
basis
for
testifying.
and
if
at
a
hearing
on
the
motion
in
limine,
the
court
determined
that
the
witness
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
facts
of
the
case
except
something
that
he
had
heard.
the
court
did
properly
exclude
the
testimony
of
that
witness
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
disqualified
by
a
reason
of
lack
of
knowledge.
that
would
not
deny
the
man
compulsory
process
to
bring
his
witness
in.
it
will
only
bar
the
witness
from
testifying
after
he
arrives
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
would
presume
that
such
a
statute
would
be
subject
to
attack
even
though
i
don't
--
i
can't
reasonably
expect
a
legislature
in
its
wisdom
to
pass
such
a
statute.
nonetheless,
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
attack
for
the
reason
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
on
the
ground
that
that
would
deny
a
man
a
fair
trial
without
reason.
that
it
would
be
outside
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
prevent
anyone
from
testifying.
whereas
i
do
not
believe
that
the
prohibition
of
a
codefendant
is
arbitrary
or
capricious
but
rather
that
it's
based
in
sound
judgment
although
the
judgment
has
now
been
changed.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i
think
by
the
same
token
if
it
bars
that,
it
would
also
bar
their
right
to
exclude
idiots,
lunatics,
and
drunkards
which
is
why
i
brought
it
up
yesterday.
there
would
be
no
end
to
it
if
you
can't
bring
in
--
i
mean
if
you
can't
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
exclude
one
man
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
then
you
get
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
now
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
neither
party
can
use
it
if
the
other
party
objects
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir
but
this
is
just
like
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
put
his
wife
on
the
stand
in
his
behalf.
but
the
state
may
not
call
the
defendant's
wife
in
his
behalf.
and
i
presume
that
if
our
present
ruling
failed
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it
also
our
statute
prohibiting
wives
from
testifying
against
their
husbands
would
fall
for
the
same
reason,
mr.
justice
black.
and
yet
i've
never
had
any
quarrel
with
the
statute.
i've
never
felt
that
we
should
attempt
to
force
wives
to
testify
against
their
husbands.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
we
don't
bar
them,
mr.
justice
black.
the
statute
says
that
the
state
cannot
call
the
defendant's
wife
and
force
her
to
testify
against
him.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
would
not
see
any
connection
there,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
there's
a
connection
between
the
man
and
his
wife,
but
i
see
no
connection
unless
it
would
be
an
illicit
one
between
him
and
another
man's
wife.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
frankly
don't
know
whether
the
privilege
would
extend
to
other
principles
or
not,
i
read
of
that.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well,
i
don't
think
if
the
constitution
under
the
sixth
amendment
should
extend
to
prohibit
--
i
mean
to
permit
a
man's
wife
to
be
forced
to
testify
against
their
husband.
and
i
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
i
don't
--
but
i
think
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i'm
sure
there
is
because
the
bill
of
rights
specifically
says
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
--
whereas
the
state
doesn't
get
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i'm
sorry
but
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
relative
difference
between
what
the
state
can
do
and
what
the
defendant
can
do
in
this
case.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
works
the
other
way.
and
i
believe
that
compulsory
process
is
available.
it
should
be
available
to
both
sides.
i
don't
know
whether
the
states
got
a
bill
of
rights
or
not
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
analogous,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
frankly
i
would
hope
that
it
applied
to
the
states
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
having
brought
in
the
rest
that
we
might
as
well
let
the
witness
clause
with
him
in
the
compulsory
process?
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
questions
whether
the
compulsory
process
clause
is
applicable.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
frankly
i
couldn't
find
any
but
i
just
assumed
that
since
the
hair
goes
with
the
hide
that
that
section
would
go
with
the
others
in
being
applicable
to
the
state.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
sometimes
the
hair
gets
burned
off,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
don't
necessarily
to
want
everybody.
i'm
just
not
going
to
fight
that
point
sir.
i
would
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
event
that
the
court
does
overturn
this
conviction
that
you
might
well
take
into
consideration
the
same
matter
that
you
did
in
the
case
of
reid
versus
plato
when
we
had
our
three
habitual
criminal
arguments
here
last
fall.
in
the
reid
case,
the
question
retroactivity
arose.
i'm
sure
that
there
are
great
many
prisoners
in
the
state
penitentiary
in
texas
right
now
who
in
one
way
or
another
would
claim
that
they
were
denied
the
right
to
call
a
codefendant.
these
are
men
whose
cases
have
long
since
been
put
to
rest.
their
time
for
--
neither
they
took
their
appeal
or
their
time
for
appeal
has
long
since
expired.
it
would
occur
to
me
that
in
the
event
you
do
overturn
this
that
you
might
put
sometime
limitation
as
you
have
done
in
some
of
your
recent
decisions
so
that
we
would
not
be
faced
with
a
substantial
number
of
applications
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
our
federal
courts
seeking
to
reopen
these
cases
on
this
basis.
i
would
hate
to
have
to
take
on
a
new
set
of
cases
because
we've
got
enough
to
say
grace
over
down
there
now.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
no
sir.
it
applies
where
the
--
where
indictments
arise
out
of
the
same
offense,
essentially
the
same
set
of
facts.
we
do
not
often
jointly
indict
in
texas
because
of
the
procedural
difficulties
that
arise
from
joint
trials
under
our
statutes.
it
is
more
normal
to
return
single
indictments
and
then
we
occasionally
join
them
together
for
trial
unless
there
is
a
motion
for
severance
filed.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
can
go
even
further
if
you
pardon
me
for
testifying
outside
the
record
and
said
i
have
permitted
litigations
that
i
have
prosecuted.
it
can
be
waived.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
and
has
been
waived,
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well,
they
call
the
witness
in
the
state
objected
so
there
was
no
question
to
waiver.
the
state
affirmatively
objected
when
the
witness
was
called
by
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
--
petitioner.
but
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
just
simply
didn't
think
it
was
going
to
particularly
hurt
my
case.
i
thought
i
might
get
something
out
of
him
on
cross-examination
that
i
wouldn't
direct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
well
i
say
when
i
don't
think
they'll
be
a
detriment
to
the
state.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
the
statute
has
been
changed.
that
was
effective
january
1st,
1966,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
very
little
appellate
experience
yet.
they've
had
some
experience
down
in
the
district
court
but
not
on
our
system.
not
many
cases
have
yet
gotten
up
to
the
appellate
court
where
this
been
done.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
--
mr.
howard
m.
fender
just
in
talking
to
other
prosecutors
at
our
various
meetings,
i've
gotten
the
impression
that
it
has
been
tried
several
times
than
as
you
say
it
has
had
variable
results.
mr.
howard
m.
fender
i
frankly
would
welcome
the
opportunity
open
to
cross-examine
the
man
that
i
would
hesitate
to
put
on
the
stand
and
vouch
for
myself
but
i
don't
--
i
can't
give
you
any
statistics
on
it
sir.
i
notice
that
my
time
is
drawing
to
a
close.
i
would
like
to
simply
remind
the
court
one
more
time
that
this
is
a
hearing
under
the
sixth
amendment
with
regard
to
compulsory
process.
and
the
state
was
made
by
the
counsel,
that
spencer,
reid
and
belle
were
affirmed
by
this
court
on
the
basis
that
no
specific
provision
the
constitution
was
violated.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
was
available
in
the
courthouse
and
was
only
prohibited
from
testifying
by
the
state
statute,
i
would
like
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
principles
enunciated
in
spencer,
reid,
and
belle,
would
be
applicable
here
because
no
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
has
been
violated.
the
compulsion
of
the
attendants
of
witnesses
in
my
view
point
was
not
denied
to
this
man.
the
testimony
was
denied
to
him
under
the
statute
after
the
witness
had
been
made
physically
available
to
him.
the
mention
of
bonner
versus
beto
which
is
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
has
to
do
with
the
husband
and
wife
relationship
and
the
denial
of
her
testimony
under
similar
circumstances
where
she
was
a
co-indictee
is
under
motion
for
rehearing
by
our
office.
and
if
we
lose
there,
we're
going
to
ask
you
all
to
review
it
unless
you
little
too
adversely
in
this
case
and
we
consider
it
ill-advised
to
do
so.
but
it
has
not
been
finally
decided
at
this
point.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
