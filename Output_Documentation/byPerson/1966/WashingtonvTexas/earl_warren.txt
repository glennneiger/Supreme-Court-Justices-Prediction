mr.
tessmer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fender.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
he
testify
for
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
under
the
rule
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
we
have
here,
could
he
testify
for
the
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
so
he
was
customarily
used
--
codefendants
to
testify
against
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
answer
that
question
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
his
reliability
is
not
--
does
not
affect
him
in
that
case
but
it
does
if
he's
to
be
used
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
block
an
idiot
from
testifying,
he
cannot
testify
for
either
side,
could
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
there
wasn't
any
direction
or
any
connection
between
the
situation
where
you
bar
an
idiot
and
where
you
borrow
--
bar
a
codefendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
no.
chief

jackie
washington,
petitioner,
versus
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
fender.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
agreed
that
they
plan
the
expedition
for
the
purpose
of
murdering
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
that
--
that
was
a
contested
fact,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
fixes
a
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
did
the
jury
fixes
the
punishment,
i
presume
it
might
be
quite
relevant
whether
he
abandoned
the
intention
to
do
whatever
he's
trying
to
do
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
it
happened.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
wouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
wouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
a
corroboration
of
that
if
it
was
in
order
to
support
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
he
was
the
codefendant
only.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
the
prosecution
have
called
him
and
used
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
if
he's
unreliable
for
one
side,
why
wouldn't
he
be
just
as
unreliable
from
the
other
--
for
the
other
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
explanation
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
invalidate
it
or
so
that
he
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
subject
to
his
credibility,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
principle
though
what
is
the
difference
between
him
testifying
for
one
side
but
not
being
able
to
testify
for
the
other
now,
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
--
well,
not
so
human
tendency
for
him
to
accuse
rather
than
to
excuse?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
the
legislature
of
texas
change
the
law
since
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
it
considered
fairness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
case
of
an
idiot,
can
the
prosecution
use
an
idiot
against
the
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
isn't
that
different
from
here
where
--
whether
the
state
can
use
a
witness
against
the
man
but
the
man
can't
use
the
witness
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
theory
on
--
what
theory
did
you
--
do
you
waive
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
use
it
only
when
it
will
benefit
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
say
though
that
if
as
to
hearsay
that
the
statute
said
that
a
defendant
could
not
produce
any
hearsay
but
that
the
prosecution
would
or
could
that
it
would
be
bad.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
isn't
it
unfair
to
allow
the
defendant's
wife
to
testify
in
his
behalf
but
to
prohibit
the
state
from
allowing
her
to
testify
in
its
behalf?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
also
you
would
say
that
the
state
could
limit
itself
in
any
way
it
wants
to
the
manner
in
which
it
would
prosecute
a
man
because
it
is
not
subject
to
the
bill
of
rights.
but
that
it
--
there
are
certain
things
that
it
cannot
do
as
to
an
individual
on
its
bill
of
rights,
and
wouldn't
that
be
a
factor
in
it
too?
