which
provision
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
sentence,
the
codefendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
affect
do
you
give
to
the
provision
of
the
sixth
amendment,
the
compulsory
process
of
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
states
could
go
further
and
abide
but
no
relative
of
any
person
charged
with
the
crime
should
be
allowed
to
be
testify
for
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
(inaudible)
the
words,
or
at
sometimes
disturbing,
arbitrarily
and
capricious
as
a
substitute
for
the
court,
the
court
can
utilize
to
make
new
laws,
constitutional
laws
when
it
so
desires.
but
what
i
was
talking
about
was
rather
this
right
--
the
sixth
amendment
some
on
which
to
having
that
available
means
to
have
them
--
have
to
be
used,
whether
that
--
why
in
your
judgment
the
sixth
amendment
shouldn't
be
construed
so
as
to
bar
what
texas
has
done
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
to
get
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
got
to
get
a
witness
who's
capable
mentally
to
testify
i
would
suppose.
maybe
he
couldn't
talk
at
all.
i
don't
think
your
idiots
and
drunkards
had,
should
they?
maybe
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
it
would
call
the
state
to
disqualify
a
state
from
barring
another
man's
wife
from
testifying
in
his
behalf?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he's
made
the
same
statement
that
a
defendant
cannot
call
another
man's
wife
to
testify
in
his
behalf?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
said
where
one
man
is
suspected
to
having
committed
the
murder,
his
wife
will
not
be
testify
--
someone
to
testify
on
behalf
of
another
man
charged
with
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
a
common
law
privilege;
i'm
talking
about
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
for
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
there's
a
difference
in
the
bill
of
rights
as
applied
to
the
state
and
applied
to
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
doesn't
get
too
far,
they
go
back
to
where
they
--
what
the
state
can
do
there.
the
question
whether
the
defendant
can
be
deprived
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
your
assumption
has
resounding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead
and
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
yesterday,
there's
a
man
who
gives
hearsay
evidence
to
testify
to
have
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
an
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
due
process
at
the
time
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
between
a
hearsay
privilege
and
other
privilege
the
hearsay
evidence,
the
evidence
that
a
man
gives
about
what
somebody
else
known
or
claimed
to
have
known.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not
evidence
of
his
knowledge
of
the
offense,
it's
the
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
in
short,
to
have
a
man
to
testify
to
somebody
he
doesn't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
what
he
say,
somebody
else
knew
which
would
--
i
suppose
one
of
the
basic
things
that
court
want
to
get
witnesses
who
are
familiar
with
the
facts
that
they
are
inquired
about.
justice
hugo

although
the
law
could
permit
hearsay?
justice

it
need
not.
