justice

white
well,
isn't
that
--
that's
certainly
a
personal
characteristic
when
he
said
that
he
didn't
have
the
skill.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
satisfied
quota
eligibility,
haven't
you,
if
you
get
a
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
people
can't
even
get
in
the
quota
can
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
some
qualifications.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
eligible
--
it
means
that
they're
eligible
for
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
some
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
now,
let's
assume
the
phony
marriage
and
the
fellow
was
in
the
quota,
he
set
a
phony
marriage
or
he
lies
about
something
else
to
get
in
this
year
and
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
in
next
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
throwing
–
well,
he
was
thrown
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
saying
it's
automatic
though.
you
are
saying
that
--
you're
saying
the
law
says
that
in
that,
he
was
eligible
for
entry
at
the
term
--
at
the
term
but
he's
deportable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
may
be
so
but
we're
dealing
with
section
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
maybe
so
but
we're
going
--
the
congress
maybe
didn't
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that

that's
