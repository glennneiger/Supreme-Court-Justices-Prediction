mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
muriel
may
scott,
the
petitioner
in
this
proceeding
is
a
native
of
jamaica,
the
west
indies.
she
seeks
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
affirming
a
determination
of
the
immigration
service
that
should
be
deported
from
the
united
states
because
of
the
fraud
perpetuated
at
entry.
this
relief
is
being
sought
pursuant
to
section
8
u.s.c.
1251
(f)
and
that
she
gave
birth
to
and
is
the
mother
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
essential
facts
are
as
follows.
petitioner
then
a
native
of
jamaica
the
british
west
indies
entered
the
united
states
on
the
non
quota
visa,
that's
nonquota
immigrant
visa
issued
to
her
as
the
wife
of
an
american
citizen.
that
was
in
1958.
in
1964
the
immigration
initiated
proceedings
against
solely
for
the
purpose
of
against
petitioner
charging
that
she
had
entered
into
the
marriage
ceremony
which
got
solely
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
for
a
nonquota
immigrant
visa
with
all
the
intention
of
establishing
a
bona
fide
marital
relationship
which
she
never
established
in
fact
subsequently
thereto.
the
sole
defense
she
raises
to
the
case
is
that
1251
(f)
prevents
some
deportation.
a
comment,
an
entry
was
excludable
for
deportation.
that
is
why
section
1251
(f)
is
being
raised
as
a
defense
1251
(f)
exempt
persons
that
have
obtained
a
visa
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
if
they
are
otherwise
admissible
and
they
are
the
parent
or
child
of
a
u.s.
citizen.
in
the
court
below
it
was
held
that
petitioner
was
qualified
in
entry
respect
except
that
there
was
no
quota
available
to
her
because
the
quota
from
jamaica
was
over
subscribed
at
that
time.
this
court
granted
certiorari
here
and
in
errico
to
resolve
the
differing
interpretation
says
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
total
defense
was
applicable
and
the
second
circuit
did
not.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
alien
who
entered
the
united
states
as
a
non
quota
immigrant
by
means
of
a
fraudulent
marriage
to
a
united
states
citizen
who
subsequently
gave
birth
to
a
citizen
child
and
was
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
and
for
the
fraud
in
avoiding
quota
requirements.
the
question
for
this
is
whether
or
not
this
particular
individual
is
subject
to
the
safe
provisions
of
section
1251
(f).
it
is
our
contention
that
the
purpose
and
language
of
the
statute
negate
the
possibility
that
otherwise
admissible
was
intended
to
encompass
the
availability
of
quota
status.
well,
before
proceeding
with
my
argument
i
certainly
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
as
to
his
question
posed
just
before
adjournment.
section
1182
(a)
of
the
immigration
act
specifically
has
placed
standards,
there
are
20
standards
criteria.
there
are
20
in
number
which
standards
cannot
be
evaded
because
they
are
the
qualitative
standards
says
settled
by
the
united
states
an
admission.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
they
may
be
disqualified
or
excludable.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
precisely,
your
honor.
precisely.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
exactly.
exactly
your
honor.
now
if
i
may
proceed.
we
don't
have
to
look
far
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
than
the
enacted
section
1251
(f).
it
was
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
family
unit
that
was
a
vital
and
paramount
interest
to
our
national
policy.
even
beyond
the
benefit
to
the
alien
is
the
likelihood
far
from
remote
in
this
case
that
expulsion
--
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
i
will
put
it
for
you
in
proper
perspective
your
honor
if
i
may.
if
i
am
married
to
a
non
citizen
when
they
arrive
in
the
united
states
i
can
go
to
the
immigration
service
fill
out
i
number
13
petition
and
demand
a
quota
visa
for
my
wife.
if
she
is
outside
of
the
united
states
she
could
do
that
to
the
consular
service.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
through
a
fraudulent
marriage,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes.
yes
your
honor.
expulsion
of
the
alien
will
result
in
banishment
of
a
citizen
during
the
period
of
its
minority.
now,
before
i
continue
with
my
argument,
the
reason
why
we
have
used
the
word
banishment
your
honor
is
that
i
want
to
give
you
an
idea
of
a
case
that
personally
tried
before
the
surface
just
last
year.
a
woman
came
here
on
a
visa
from
british
honduras
and
once
she
was
here
she
met
an
american
sailor.
she
became
a
fiancée
of
the
sailor
and
she
married
the
sailor.
the
sailor
did
not
want
to
fill
the
petition
that
i
just
explained
to
you,
your
honor
for
her
but
he
was
not
also
taking
care
of
the
woman.
the
immigration
service
discovered
that
this
woman
had
been
employed
outside.
and
they
apprehended
the
woman
but
the
woman
in
the
meantime
given
birth
to
a
child.
the
red
cross
called
the
legal
aide
and
asked
us
whether
or
not
you
would
not
represent
the
woman
before
the
immigration
service.
i
appeared
before
the
service
and
i
pleaded
but
i
confronted
the
discretionary
relief
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
woman
was
ordered
deported
and
i
had
the
hardest
time
between
the
red
cross
illegally
and
if
you
please
the
army,
your
honor,
to
get
this
woman
to
stay
here
for
a
while
longer
to
obtain
an
allotment.
the
minute
she
obtained
the
allotment,
the
auditor
deported
her
immediately
and
--
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
well
she
was
entitled
as
a
citizen
of
the
--
the
child
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
allotment
from
the
father.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
after
the
woman
was
deported,
i
discussed
this
case
again
with
one
of
the
members
in
the
service
so
they
said
to
me,
“(inaudible)
we
didn't
throw
the
american
citizen
out
of
the
country.
the
american
citizen
can
stay
here
even
if
she's
--
if
he's
one
month
old”
and
i
thought
that
was
a
horrible
thing
to
do
your
honor
because
in
every
ordered
law,
you
can
go
and
appoint
a
guardian
for
an
infant
to
take
care
of
the
infant's
property
or
a
guardian
for
the
infant
alone.
but
on
the
immigration
law,
you
cannot
appoint
a
guardian
for
a
child
to
petition
a
relief
on
the
parent
and
i
think
that
the
congress
had
exactly
these
situations
in
mind
when
they
said
that
this
statute
has
to
be
applicable
as
a
total
defense
and
that
no
discretion
of
the
relief
should
be
granted
to
the
attorney
general
in
situations
like
this.
with
the
exception
of
the
fraud
by
which
you
obtain
for
nonquota
visa,
petitioner
was
qualified
as
a
person
otherwise
admissible
since
he
falls
with
none
of
the
groups
that
i
just
recited
to
your
honor,
the
political
group,
the
mental
group,
the
political
group
of
agents
proscribed
from
receiving
a
visa.
however,
the
court
below
again
says
that
mrs.
scott
is
admissible
in
all
other
respect
except
that
she
is
not
otherwise
admissible
because
there
was
no
visa
available
for
them
because
the
british
honduras
quota
system
for
jamaica
was
over
subscribed.
we
submit
that
this
interpretation
can
only
stand
if
you
are
prepared
to
attribute
to
congress
the
intention
of
passing
a
law
widely
heralded
as
humanitarian
which
affects
almost
no
one
and
which
is
inconsistent
with
other
law's
contemporaneously
passed.
the
act
of
1957,
the
first
part
of
section
7
of
the
act
of
1957
was
carried
forward
as
section
1251
(f)
and
it
dealt
with
affording
relief
from
deportation
to
those
person
that
would
be
expelled.
the
second
sentence
of
the
same
act
carried
forward
as
section
15
affords
exclusion
for
non
resident
alien
with
the
same
familial
status
as
to
citizen
situated
as
petitioner
andif
i
may
i'd
like
to
read
the
statute,
sir.
“any
alien
who
is
the
spouse,
parent
or
child
of
a
united
states
citizen
and
who
is
excludable
because
(1)
he
seeks
has
sought
to
procure
or
has
procured
a
visa
or
other
documentation
or
entry
to
the
united
states
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
or
(2)
he
admits
the
commission
of
perjury
in
connection
therewith
shall
be
granted
a
visa
and
admitted
to
the
united
states
for
permanent
residents
if
otherwise
admissible,
if
the
attorney
general
in
his
discretion
has
consented
to
the
aliens
applying
or
reapplying
for
admission
to
the
united
states.”
this
section
using
the
same
otherwise
admissible
language
as
the
statute
know
before
the
court
for
construction
clearly
and
i
emphasize
that,
it
clearly
does
not
contemplate
the
availability
of
a
quota
place
since
the
familiar
relationship
which
is
the
factor,
which
gives
rise
to
the
extension
to
the
--
from
excludability
also
confers
nonquota
or
if
you
please
preferred
status
upon
the
alien.
for
us
to
attribute
the
congress
the
intention
of
incorporating
into
the
quota
system
the
familial
extension
would
mean
that
the
more
fatal
the
exemption
is
granted
to
aliens
outside
of
the
united
states
than
aliens
in
the
united
states.
and
what
we're
seeing
that
congress
is
doing
instead
of
tying
the
family
together
we
are
attributing
the
congress
that
the
congress
is
saying
now
well,
we
are
going
to
break
up
a
family
and
the
man
that's
out
will
bring
that
in
and
send
the
man
that's
out,
and
i
cannot
understand
or
think
that
congress
had
planned
to
do
this.
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
same
otherwise
admissible
language
should
success
a
sentence
of
the
1957
act
promote
a
national
policy
of
uniting
a
non-resident
alien
british
american
family
and
yet
required
a
break
up
or
immigration
of
the
american
family
of
a
resident
alien.
it
is
all
the
more
illogical
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
compel
expulsion
without
living
any
discretion
to
the
attorney
general
to
exempt
certain
individuals
a
discretion,
if
you
please,
which
is
given
in
the
section
where
we
don't
want
certain
people
from
that
are
proscribed
from
receiving
visas.
it
is
true
that
the
construction
that
we
place
upon
the
two
statutes
which
stand
in
pari
materia
gives
broader
right
of
resident
to
the
resident
alien
than
the
non-resident
alien
that
is,
we're
taking
the
position
by
the
attorney
general's
discretion
is
not
involved
in
the
form
of
situation
but
the
only
alternative
that
the
governments
render
is
the
broader
right
to
residence,
for
the
non
resident
aliens.
now,
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
nowhere
in
the
history
and
i
have
worked
on
the
history
with
a
number
of
law
students
for
a
number
of
months
and
we
have
read
and
read
and
read
many
books,
no
clear
reference
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
otherwise
admissible
appears
in
any
of
the
records
or
reports
accompanying
the
1957
act.
general
reference
to
the
effect
by
the
entire
16
sections
of
the
act
did
not
change
the
quota
system
were
continuously
made
by
senator
eastland
in
the
senate
and
they
were
also
made
by
mr.
--
representative
celler
and
chellos
in
the
house.
on
the
other
hand
general
reference
to
the
effect
that
section
7
was
designed
to
leave
hardship
conditions
were
made
by
the
then
senator
kennedy
and
johnson
and
also
by
senator
eastland.
the
general
tenet
of
all
references
to
the
1957
act
in
the
house
report
and
i
quote
here
“indicate
that
the
congress
intended
to
provide
for
a
liberal
treatment
of
children
and
was
consumed
to
keeping
families
of
the
united
states,
of
united
states
citizens
immigrants
united.
later
in
the
house
reports,
at
page
10,
11,
it
stated
that
the
exemption
provision
of
section
7
include
the
spouses,
parents
and
children
of
united
states
citizens
or
lawfully
resident
aliens
who
may
have
misrepresented
their
place
of
birth,
nationality,
immigrant
status
and
the
like
if
their
exclusion
would
work
extreme
hardship
on
their
families
in
respect
to
extortion
of
aliens
who
are
the
spouses,
parent,
or
children
of
united
states
citizens
are
lawfully
resident
aliens
and
who
are
already
in
the
united
states
misrepresentation
in
obtaining
documentation
or
entry
would
not
be
a
ground
for
deportation
if
the
alien
will
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry.
i
am
quoting
all
of
these
from
the
records
of
the
congress
,your
honors.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
i
take
it
all
of
these
went
to
congressional
record,
that's
the
legislative
history,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
i
think
we
have
it
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
on
page
7.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
and
page
8.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
the
reports
also
stated
that
in
the
past
considering
the
family
situation
had
resulted
in
enactment
of
a
number
of
private
bills
but
that
the
more
humanitarian
approach
wanted
to
be
taken
and
give
a
whole
class
the
benefit
of
this
bill.
now,
somewhere
the
government
argued
that
--
now,
the
belief
was
also
stated
in
this
report
at
page
11
that
most
resident
aliens
falling
into
the
latter
category
makes
it
the
national
the
fact
that
a
large
in
number
mexican
nationals
had
gotten
the
benefit
of
this
particular
section
and
that
mexico
was
a
nonquota
country.
this
does
not
show
anything.
i
mean,
it's
just
an
accident.
now,
the
effect
of
the
statute
as
we
see
it
is
fourfold
in
nature.
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
held
that
petitioner's
fraud
would
invite
wholesale
evasion
of
the
quota
system
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
decision.
now,
the
ominous
prediction
of
the
effect
is
unwarranted.
first,
it
assumes
wholesale
undiscovered
fraud
--
fraudulent
practices
as
has
been
the
case
in
this
particular
case.
then
it
further
assumes
that
immigrants
intended
a
design
of
the
fraudulent
and
the
subsequently
change
of
a
familiar
status
in
such
a
manner
to
acquire
a
citizen
spouse
and
a
citizen
child.
we
hardly
think
that
petitioner
at
the
time
of
her
fraudulent
and
she
planned
to
bear
a
citizen
child
or
that
she
anticipated
that
the
plan
would
be
to
release
her
off
her
fraud.
i
would
think
that
such
an
alien
would
really
be
a
sophisticated
alien
to
plan
all
of
that.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
but
--
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
take
the
position
that
this
statute
is
applicable
to
her
as
a
total
defense,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
there
are
few
more
examples
that
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
i
could
have
five
minutes
to
the
attorney
general
but
for
one
more
point
that
i
want
to
make.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
thank
you.
in
the
court
below,
the
government
contended
and
the
court
held
that
the
otherwise
admissible
language
included
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
admissibility
and
availability
of
a
quota
placed
at
the
time
of
entry.
the
effect
of
this
interpretation
is
to
relieve
of
the
fraud
or
material
representation
only
those
aliens
who
never
had
to
perpetuate
a
fraud
to
gain
admission
nor
do
we
see
house
section
241
(f)
of
the
immigration
law
under
the
new
law
at
the
present
time
where
45,000
visas
are
allocated
for
each
quarter
that
if
a
person
which
says
it's
a
quarterly
worldwide
series
for
immigrants
for
the
first
three
quarters
of
any
--
this
any
person
who
enters
in
a
particular
quarter
of
the
year
in
which
this
worldwide
sealing
is
filled
under
the
government's
interpretation
not
otherwise
be
admissible.
however,
if
they
waited
until
the
fourth
quarter
when
the
other
45,000
visas
were
available
and
then
make
application
and
then
he
would
automatically
get
a
visa.
in
short,
the
government's
interpretation
then
of
the
exception
provision
either
virtually
meaningless
or
effectively
according
to
a
sliding
scale
of
opportunity
values
which
bears
no
relationship
to
congress
concerned
for
maintaining
existing
family
unit.
we
therefore
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
errico
decision
and
reverse
the
scott
decision
in
the
second
circuit.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
answer
your
question
there
is
a
quota
system
for
latin
america
and
that
it
is
specified
in
the
law
that
these
people
are
special
immigrants
and
in
order
to
be
a
special
immigrant
they
have
to
comply
with
certain
formalities.
for
example,
no
latin
american
can
come
in
this
country
or
anybody
from
the
west
indies
at
the
present
time
unless
they
obtain
a
legal
clearance
certificate
from
the
united
states
department
of
labor
provided
that
they
do
not
fall
in
any
one
of
the
exempted
categories.
therefore,
if
mrs.
scott
goes
back
to
jamaica,
i
doubt
that
she
will
ever
come
back
in
the
country
and
as
to
the
five
examples
that
judge
--
mr.
justice
fortas
has
addressed
himself
before,
i
am
practically
saying
to
you,
your
honor
that
these
examples
are
examples
born
of
the
discretionary
relief
that
the
attorney
general
already
has
so
they
really
have
no
theory
on
section
1251
(f).
here
we
are
claiming
that
they
we
have
a
statute
construction
in
which
there
are
only
two
cases.
one
is
in
favor
of
the
statute
and
the
other
one
is
against
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
there
was
sympathy
at
the
heart
of
congress
when
they
enacted
the
statute
and
i
cannot
see
that
this
statute
should
not
be
given
a
rather
total
effect
than
rather
discretionary
effect
which
the
attorney
general
was
praying
for
it.
i
have
been
before
the
immigration
service
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
for
the
legal
aid
society
and
i
find
it
really
pathetic,
your
honors,
if
what's
so
impossible
to
see
there
is
really
a
case
that
evokes
sympathy
and
that
sympathy
is
being
materially
denied.
and
you
can't
go
to
the
federal
court
and
say
well
this
and
this
and
this
is
this
case
but
your
honor
has
nothing
to
do.
mr.
biervliet
there's
nothing
that
we
can
do
for
you.
the
service
had
not
abused
their
authority
so
therefore
you
have
no
case.
the
service
is
affirmed
and
it's
in
that
spirit
that
i
am
calling
here
to
ask
for
help
from
this
court
because
i
think
we
should
really
help
mrs.
scott.
thank
you
very
kindly.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
muriel
may
scott,
the
petitioner
in
this
proceeding
is
a
native
of
jamaica,
the
west
indies.
she
seeks
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
affirming
a
determination
of
the
immigration
service
that
should
be
deported
from
the
united
states
because
of
the
fraud
perpetuated
at
entry.
this
relief
is
being
sought
pursuant
to
section
8
u.s.c.
1251
(f)
and
that
she
gave
birth
to
and
is
the
mother
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
essential
facts
are
as
follows.
petitioner
then
a
native
of
jamaica
the
british
west
indies
entered
the
united
states
on
the
non
quota
visa,
that's
nonquota
immigrant
visa
issued
to
her
as
the
wife
of
an
american
citizen.
that
was
in
1958.
in
1964
the
immigration
initiated
proceedings
against
solely
for
the
purpose
of
against
petitioner
charging
that
she
had
entered
into
the
marriage
ceremony
which
got
solely
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
for
a
nonquota
immigrant
visa
with
all
the
intention
of
establishing
a
bona
fide
marital
relationship
which
she
never
established
in
fact
subsequently
thereto.
the
sole
defense
she
raises
to
the
case
is
that
1251
(f)
prevents
some
deportation.
a
comment,
an
entry
was
excludable
for
deportation.
that
is
why
section
1251
(f)
is
being
raised
as
a
defense
1251
(f)
exempt
persons
that
have
obtained
a
visa
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
if
they
are
otherwise
admissible
and
they
are
the
parent
or
child
of
a
u.s.
citizen.
in
the
court
below
it
was
held
that
petitioner
was
qualified
in
entry
respect
except
that
there
was
no
quota
available
to
her
because
the
quota
from
jamaica
was
over
subscribed
at
that
time.
this
court
granted
certiorari
here
and
in
errico
to
resolve
the
differing
interpretation
says
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
total
defense
was
applicable
and
the
second
circuit
did
not.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
alien
who
entered
the
united
states
as
a
non
quota
immigrant
by
means
of
a
fraudulent
marriage
to
a
united
states
citizen
who
subsequently
gave
birth
to
a
citizen
child
and
was
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
and
for
the
fraud
in
avoiding
quota
requirements.
the
question
for
this
is
whether
or
not
this
particular
individual
is
subject
to
the
safe
provisions
of
section
1251
(f).
it
is
our
contention
that
the
purpose
and
language
of
the
statute
negate
the
possibility
that
otherwise
admissible
was
intended
to
encompass
the
availability
of
quota
status.
well,
before
proceeding
with
my
argument
i
certainly
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
as
to
his
question
posed
just
before
adjournment.
section
1182
(a)
of
the
immigration
act
specifically
has
placed
standards,
there
are
20
standards
criteria.
there
are
20
in
number
which
standards
cannot
be
evaded
because
they
are
the
qualitative
standards
says
settled
by
the
united
states
an
admission.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
they
may
be
disqualified
or
excludable.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
precisely,
your
honor.
precisely.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
exactly.
exactly
your
honor.
now
if
i
may
proceed.
we
don't
have
to
look
far
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
than
the
enacted
section
1251
(f).
it
was
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
family
unit
that
was
a
vital
and
paramount
interest
to
our
national
policy.
even
beyond
the
benefit
to
the
alien
is
the
likelihood
far
from
remote
in
this
case
that
expulsion
--
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
i
will
put
it
for
you
in
proper
perspective
your
honor
if
i
may.
if
i
am
married
to
a
non
citizen
when
they
arrive
in
the
united
states
i
can
go
to
the
immigration
service
fill
out
i
number
13
petition
and
demand
a
quota
visa
for
my
wife.
if
she
is
outside
of
the
united
states
she
could
do
that
to
the
consular
service.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
through
a
fraudulent
marriage,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes.
yes
your
honor.
expulsion
of
the
alien
will
result
in
banishment
of
a
citizen
during
the
period
of
its
minority.
now,
before
i
continue
with
my
argument,
the
reason
why
we
have
used
the
word
banishment
your
honor
is
that
i
want
to
give
you
an
idea
of
a
case
that
personally
tried
before
the
surface
just
last
year.
a
woman
came
here
on
a
visa
from
british
honduras
and
once
she
was
here
she
met
an
american
sailor.
she
became
a
fiancée
of
the
sailor
and
she
married
the
sailor.
the
sailor
did
not
want
to
fill
the
petition
that
i
just
explained
to
you,
your
honor
for
her
but
he
was
not
also
taking
care
of
the
woman.
the
immigration
service
discovered
that
this
woman
had
been
employed
outside.
and
they
apprehended
the
woman
but
the
woman
in
the
meantime
given
birth
to
a
child.
the
red
cross
called
the
legal
aide
and
asked
us
whether
or
not
you
would
not
represent
the
woman
before
the
immigration
service.
i
appeared
before
the
service
and
i
pleaded
but
i
confronted
the
discretionary
relief
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
woman
was
ordered
deported
and
i
had
the
hardest
time
between
the
red
cross
illegally
and
if
you
please
the
army,
your
honor,
to
get
this
woman
to
stay
here
for
a
while
longer
to
obtain
an
allotment.
the
minute
she
obtained
the
allotment,
the
auditor
deported
her
immediately
and
--
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
well
she
was
entitled
as
a
citizen
of
the
--
the
child
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
allotment
from
the
father.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
after
the
woman
was
deported,
i
discussed
this
case
again
with
one
of
the
members
in
the
service
so
they
said
to
me,
“(inaudible)
we
didn't
throw
the
american
citizen
out
of
the
country.
the
american
citizen
can
stay
here
even
if
she's
--
if
he's
one
month
old”
and
i
thought
that
was
a
horrible
thing
to
do
your
honor
because
in
every
ordered
law,
you
can
go
and
appoint
a
guardian
for
an
infant
to
take
care
of
the
infant's
property
or
a
guardian
for
the
infant
alone.
but
on
the
immigration
law,
you
cannot
appoint
a
guardian
for
a
child
to
petition
a
relief
on
the
parent
and
i
think
that
the
congress
had
exactly
these
situations
in
mind
when
they
said
that
this
statute
has
to
be
applicable
as
a
total
defense
and
that
no
discretion
of
the
relief
should
be
granted
to
the
attorney
general
in
situations
like
this.
with
the
exception
of
the
fraud
by
which
you
obtain
for
nonquota
visa,
petitioner
was
qualified
as
a
person
otherwise
admissible
since
he
falls
with
none
of
the
groups
that
i
just
recited
to
your
honor,
the
political
group,
the
mental
group,
the
political
group
of
agents
proscribed
from
receiving
a
visa.
however,
the
court
below
again
says
that
mrs.
scott
is
admissible
in
all
other
respect
except
that
she
is
not
otherwise
admissible
because
there
was
no
visa
available
for
them
because
the
british
honduras
quota
system
for
jamaica
was
over
subscribed.
we
submit
that
this
interpretation
can
only
stand
if
you
are
prepared
to
attribute
to
congress
the
intention
of
passing
a
law
widely
heralded
as
humanitarian
which
affects
almost
no
one
and
which
is
inconsistent
with
other
law's
contemporaneously
passed.
the
act
of
1957,
the
first
part
of
section
7
of
the
act
of
1957
was
carried
forward
as
section
1251
(f)
and
it
dealt
with
affording
relief
from
deportation
to
those
person
that
would
be
expelled.
the
second
sentence
of
the
same
act
carried
forward
as
section
15
affords
exclusion
for
non
resident
alien
with
the
same
familial
status
as
to
citizen
situated
as
petitioner
andif
i
may
i'd
like
to
read
the
statute,
sir.
“any
alien
who
is
the
spouse,
parent
or
child
of
a
united
states
citizen
and
who
is
excludable
because
(1)
he
seeks
has
sought
to
procure
or
has
procured
a
visa
or
other
documentation
or
entry
to
the
united
states
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
or
(2)
he
admits
the
commission
of
perjury
in
connection
therewith
shall
be
granted
a
visa
and
admitted
to
the
united
states
for
permanent
residents
if
otherwise
admissible,
if
the
attorney
general
in
his
discretion
has
consented
to
the
aliens
applying
or
reapplying
for
admission
to
the
united
states.”
this
section
using
the
same
otherwise
admissible
language
as
the
statute
know
before
the
court
for
construction
clearly
and
i
emphasize
that,
it
clearly
does
not
contemplate
the
availability
of
a
quota
place
since
the
familiar
relationship
which
is
the
factor,
which
gives
rise
to
the
extension
to
the
--
from
excludability
also
confers
nonquota
or
if
you
please
preferred
status
upon
the
alien.
for
us
to
attribute
the
congress
the
intention
of
incorporating
into
the
quota
system
the
familial
extension
would
mean
that
the
more
fatal
the
exemption
is
granted
to
aliens
outside
of
the
united
states
than
aliens
in
the
united
states.
and
what
we're
seeing
that
congress
is
doing
instead
of
tying
the
family
together
we
are
attributing
the
congress
that
the
congress
is
saying
now
well,
we
are
going
to
break
up
a
family
and
the
man
that's
out
will
bring
that
in
and
send
the
man
that's
out,
and
i
cannot
understand
or
think
that
congress
had
planned
to
do
this.
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
same
otherwise
admissible
language
should
success
a
sentence
of
the
1957
act
promote
a
national
policy
of
uniting
a
non-resident
alien
british
american
family
and
yet
required
a
break
up
or
immigration
of
the
american
family
of
a
resident
alien.
it
is
all
the
more
illogical
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
compel
expulsion
without
living
any
discretion
to
the
attorney
general
to
exempt
certain
individuals
a
discretion,
if
you
please,
which
is
given
in
the
section
where
we
don't
want
certain
people
from
that
are
proscribed
from
receiving
visas.
it
is
true
that
the
construction
that
we
place
upon
the
two
statutes
which
stand
in
pari
materia
gives
broader
right
of
resident
to
the
resident
alien
than
the
non-resident
alien
that
is,
we're
taking
the
position
by
the
attorney
general's
discretion
is
not
involved
in
the
form
of
situation
but
the
only
alternative
that
the
governments
render
is
the
broader
right
to
residence,
for
the
non
resident
aliens.
now,
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
nowhere
in
the
history
and
i
have
worked
on
the
history
with
a
number
of
law
students
for
a
number
of
months
and
we
have
read
and
read
and
read
many
books,
no
clear
reference
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
otherwise
admissible
appears
in
any
of
the
records
or
reports
accompanying
the
1957
act.
general
reference
to
the
effect
by
the
entire
16
sections
of
the
act
did
not
change
the
quota
system
were
continuously
made
by
senator
eastland
in
the
senate
and
they
were
also
made
by
mr.
--
representative
celler
and
chellos
in
the
house.
on
the
other
hand
general
reference
to
the
effect
that
section
7
was
designed
to
leave
hardship
conditions
were
made
by
the
then
senator
kennedy
and
johnson
and
also
by
senator
eastland.
the
general
tenet
of
all
references
to
the
1957
act
in
the
house
report
and
i
quote
here
“indicate
that
the
congress
intended
to
provide
for
a
liberal
treatment
of
children
and
was
consumed
to
keeping
families
of
the
united
states,
of
united
states
citizens
immigrants
united.
later
in
the
house
reports,
at
page
10,
11,
it
stated
that
the
exemption
provision
of
section
7
include
the
spouses,
parents
and
children
of
united
states
citizens
or
lawfully
resident
aliens
who
may
have
misrepresented
their
place
of
birth,
nationality,
immigrant
status
and
the
like
if
their
exclusion
would
work
extreme
hardship
on
their
families
in
respect
to
extortion
of
aliens
who
are
the
spouses,
parent,
or
children
of

are
lawfully
resident
aliens
and
who
are
already
in
the
united
states
misrepresentation
in
obtaining
documentation
or
entry
would
not
be
a
ground
for
deportation
if
the
alien
will
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry.

all
of
these
from

mr.

the
reports
also
stated
that
in
the
past
considering
the
family
situation
had
resulted
in
enactment
of
a
number
of
private
bills
but
that
the
more
humanitarian
approach
wanted
to
be
taken
and
give
a
whole
class
the
benefit
of
this
bill.
now,
somewhere
the
government
argued
that
--
now,
the
belief
was
also
stated
in
this
report
at
page
11
that
most
resident
aliens
falling
into
the
latter
category
makes
it
the
national
the
fact
that
a
large
in
number
mexican
nationals
had
gotten
the
benefit
of
this
particular
section
and
that
mexico
was
a
nonquota
country.
this
does
not
show
anything.
i
mean,
it's
just
an
accident.
now,
the
effect
of
the
statute
as
we
see
it
is
fourfold
in
nature.
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
held
that
petitioner's
fraud
would
invite
wholesale
evasion
of
the
quota
system
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
decision.
now,
the
ominous
prediction
of
the
effect
is
unwarranted.
first,
it
assumes
wholesale
undiscovered
fraud
--
fraudulent
practices
as
has
been
the
case
in
this
particular
case.
then
it
further
assumes
that
immigrants
intended
a
design
of
the
fraudulent
and
the
subsequently
change
of
a
familiar
status
in
such
a
manner
to
acquire
a
citizen
spouse
and
a
citizen
child.
we
hardly
think
that
petitioner
at
the
time
of
her
fraudulent
and
she
planned
to
bear
a
citizen
child
or
that
she
anticipated
that
the
plan
would
be
to
release
her
off
her
fraud.
i
would
think
that
such
an
alien
would
really
be
a
sophisticated
alien
to
plan
all
of
that.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
but
--
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
take
the
position
that
this
statute
is
applicable
to
her
as
a
total
defense,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
there
are
few
more
examples
that
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
i
could
have
five
minutes
to
the
attorney
general
but
for
one
more
point
that
i
want
to
make.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
thank
you.
in
the
court
below,
the
government
contended
and
the
court
held
that
the
otherwise
admissible
language
included
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
admissibility
and
availability
of
a
quota
placed
at
the
time
of
entry.
the
effect
of
this
interpretation
is
to
relieve
of
the
fraud
or
material
representation
only
those
aliens
who
never
had
to
perpetuate
a
fraud
to
gain
admission
nor
do
we
see
house
section
241
(f)
of
the
immigration
law
under
the
new
law
at
the
present
time
where
45,000
visas
are
allocated
for
each
quarter
that
if
a
person
which
says
it's
a
quarterly
worldwide
series
for
immigrants
for
the
first
three
quarters
of
any
--
this
any
person
who
enters
in
a
particular
quarter
of
the
year
in
which
this
worldwide
sealing
is
filled
under
the
government's
interpretation
not
otherwise
be
admissible.
however,
if
they
waited
until
the
fourth
quarter
when
the
other
45,000
visas
were
available
and
then
make
application
and
then
he
would
automatically
get
a
visa.
in
short,
the
government's
interpretation
then
of
the
exception
provision
either
virtually
meaningless
or
effectively
according
to
a
sliding
scale
of
opportunity
values
which
bears
no
relationship
to
congress
concerned
for
maintaining
existing
family
unit.
we
therefore
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
errico
decision
and
reverse
the
scott
decision
in
the
second
circuit.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
c.
biervliet
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
answer
your
question
there
is
a
quota
system
for
latin
america
and
that
it
is
specified
in
the
law
that
these
people
are
special
immigrants
and
in
order
to
be
a
special
immigrant
they
have
to
comply
with
certain
formalities.
for
example,
no
latin
american
can
come
in
this
country
or
anybody
from
the
west
indies
at
the
present
time
unless
they
obtain
a
legal
clearance
certificate
from
the
united
states
department
of
labor
provided
that
they
do
not
fall
in
any
one
of
the
exempted
categories.
therefore,
if
mrs.
scott
goes
back
to
jamaica,
i
doubt
that
she
will
ever
come
back
in
the
country
and
as
to
the
five
examples
that
judge
--
mr.
justice
fortas
has
addressed
himself
before,
i
am
practically
saying
to
you,
your
honor
that
these
examples
are
examples
born
of
the
discretionary
relief
that
the
attorney
general
already
has
so
they
really
have
no
theory
on
section
1251
(f).
here
we
are
claiming
that
they
we
have
a
statute
construction
in
which
there
are
only
two
cases.
one
is
in
favor
of
the
statute
and
the
other
one
is
against
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
there
was
sympathy
at
the
heart
of
congress
when
they
enacted
the
statute
and
i
cannot
see
that
this
statute
should
not
be
given
a
rather
total
effect
than
rather
discretionary
effect
which
the
attorney
general
was
praying
for
it.
i
have
been
before
the
immigration
service
for
the
last
six
or
seven
years
for
the
legal
aid
society
and
i
find
it
really
pathetic,
your
honors,
if
what's
so
impossible
to
see
there
is
really
a
case
that
evokes
sympathy
and
that
sympathy
is
being
materially
denied.
and
you
can't
go
to
the
federal
court
and
say
well
this
and
this
and
this
is
this
case
but
your
honor
has
nothing
to
do.
mr.
biervliet
there's
nothing
that
we
can
do
for
you.
the
service
had
not
abused
their
authority
so
therefore
you
have
no
case.
the
service
is
affirmed
and
it's
in
that
spirit
that
i
am
calling
here
to
ask
for
help
from
this
court
because
i
think
we
should
really
help
mrs.
scott.
thank
you
very
kindly.
