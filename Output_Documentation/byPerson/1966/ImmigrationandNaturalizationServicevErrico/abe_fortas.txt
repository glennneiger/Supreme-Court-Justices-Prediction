justice
abe
fortas
but
general
on
the
other
hand
can
you
suggest
a
type
of
misrepresentation
or
fraudulent
statement
that
would
be
material
and
that
would
not
affect
his
admissibility
as
in
the
time
of
entry.
now,
what
kind
of
thing
could
come
as
it
contemplated
here
if
it
didn't
relate
to
his
qualification
for
entry?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
read
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
these
categories
would
or
might
very
well
affect
his
admissibility
as
of
the
time
of
entry
and
in
circumstances
are
very
much
like
this
case
or
the
next
case
the
scott
case
that
were
treating
up
next
when
he
says
pass
activities
well,
suppose
there's
a
misrepresentation
about
his
communist
party
affiliation
in
the
past.
wouldn't
that
affect
his
eligibility
as
of
the
time
of
entry?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
here
this
fellow
said
that
he
is
a
good
mechanic
on
foreign
cars,
that's
what
he
said.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
there's
been
a
finding
that
makes
it
clear
that
he
wasn't
a
mechanic
--
automobile
mechanic
or
something
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
so
he
was
allowed
coming
in
this
country
and
he's
been
working
ever
since
then
but
not
as
a
mechanic
on
foreign
cars,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
agency
started
out
as
the
(inaudible)
on
foreign
cars
but
why
is
that
different
from
some
--
any
of
these
other
situations?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now,
suppose
a
mexican
says
that
he's
got
a
thousand
dollars
or
whatever
to
acquire
him
and
he
then
get
but
for
that
misrepresentation,
he
couldn't
get
any
either.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
mean
to
say
that
if
this
statute,
the
statutory
provision
and
should
be
confined
misrepresentations
that
are
not
material
and
not
important
because
they
are
subsequently
corrected.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
a
misrepresentation
that
would
affect
his
eligibility
for
entry
as
of
the
time
he
made
it.
justice
abe
fortas
the
next
case
is
not
a
quota
case,
the
scott
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
she
made
some
misrepresentations
about
her
marital
status.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
take
a
lot
of
your
time
but
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this
now.
is
the
only
qualification
which
supports
the
government
contends
on
which
and
he
seems
to
be
the
wording
of
the
statute,
that
the
immigrant
has
to
have
been
eligible
for
entry
as
a
matter
of
quota.
now,
if
that
is
satisfied
then
you
construe
the
statutory
language
as
in
effect
the
excusing
or
waiving
any
other
misrepresentations
of
whatever
nature.
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
the
only
limit
--
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
only
limitation
is
the
--
is
that
the
person
must
have
been
eligible
for
entry
as
a
numerical
manner
under
the
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that's
a
kind
of
an
importance
as
to
say
whether
the
government
says
that
that
language
is
limited
only
by
a
quota
consideration.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
i'm
talking
about
what
does
this
statute
mean
and
what
does
this
statute
says.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
will
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
assume
there
wouldn't
be
any
misunderstanding
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
would
assume
a
lesson
until
otherwise
advised
by
you
that
the
government's
position
is
that
you
don't
--
there
are
no
other,
in
no
other
situations
where
you
go
to
the
basic
circumstances
at
the
time
of
entry
except
as
to
a
matter
of
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
seem
to
me
that
would
describe
the
statute
that
it's
the
only
kind
of
a
misrepresentation
that
a
person
is
likely
to
make
as
one
that
relates
to
in
the
terms
of
admissibility.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
when
you
talk
about
quota
system,
you're
talking
about
the
basic
quota
system,
aren't
you?
for
example,
at
the
time
that
this
respondent
came
into
the
country
was
there
a
numerical
limitation
on
the
number
of
skilled
people
who
could
be
brought
in
over
the
quota?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
a
number
of
them.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
is
it
your
position
then
that
this
misrepresentation
could
not
be
waived
because
he
could
not
--
because
out
of
the
existence
of
this
particular
specific
quota
for
skilled
persons?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
certainly
could,
if
he
had
in
fact
then
a
skilled
person,
he
would
come
within
that
part
of
the
quota.
oh!
yes,
yes.
yes,
no
question.
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
understand
your
position,
perhaps
i
don't,
it
is
that
you
would
have
to
qualify
that
unless
there
was
an
open
number
in
the
basic
quota
system
for
non-skilled
people
that
this
probably
is
deportable.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we're
not
--
that's
right.
that
is
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
other
hand,
that
there
had
been
a
--
if
there
had
been
some
open
numbers
in
this
basic
quota,
presumably
this
probably
wouldn't
have
to
lie.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he'd
just
apply
for
a
quota
number
and
come
in
under
the
regular
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
believe
that
that's
what
the
statute
means.
justice
abe
fortas
except
that
if
you
forget
about
it
you
waive
this
misrepresentation
then
you
can
–-
and
if
you
waive
that
misrepresentation,
i
assume
that
otherwise
in
fact
waive
it,
perhaps
and
arrive
to
the
assumption
that
fellow
was
in
fact
a
skilled
mechanic.
he
came
in
under
this
special
quota
for
skilled
mechanics.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
it
and
then
the
question
is
whether
that
language
can
be
construed
in
that
fashion
which
substantially
narrows
it
down.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
doing
is
--
what
you're
doing
is
on
this
theory
you
may
be
coming
close
to
waiving
unnecessary
perjury
but
not
waiving
necessary
perjury.
justice
abe
fortas
well
suppose
he's
subject
to
prosecution
for
false
statement
and
a
name?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
question
i
am
really
asking
you
is
this,
i
assume
that
underlying
this
rather
remarkable
provision
is
a
desire
to
protect
the
family
entity
which
has
established
itself
in
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
assume
too
there
is
not
a
desire
to
benefit
somebody
who
files
a
false
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
what
i
am
really
asking
you
is
whether
it
can
be
considered
that
what
congress
has
done
is
to
say
that
in
those
cases,
the
recourse
of
the
government
the
punished
person
for
false
statement
is
to
resort
to
the
criminal
process
rather
than
to
the
process
of
deportation
which
would
result
in
disrupting
a
family
unity,
does
that
or
does
it
not
accord
with
your
understanding
of
the
general
theory
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
mean
because
he
was
otherwise
qualified?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
he
was
not
otherwise
qualified
and
his
in
deference
to
my
brother
brennan.
justice
abe
fortas
what
allotment
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
their
adversaries
in
these
two
cases,
they
say
that
it's
used
in
these
other
places,
so
as
not
to
include
the
quota
and
the
corner
case
of
restrictions,
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
in
connection
with
the
use
of
the
phrase
otherwise
admissible.
justice
abe
fortas
oh
that's
what
i
am
talking
about.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
your
adversaries,
they
are
saying
that
wherever
this
phrase
has
been
used,
otherwise
admissible,
it
refers
to
these
qualifications
other
than
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
ask
you
again,
what
is
your
position
exactly
in
the
case.
suppose
he
had
been
a
communist
(inaudible)
and
he
has
filed
an
affidavit
or
representing
that
he
was
not
a
communist
or
that
he
has
not
a
tubercular
and
an
affidavit
had
been
posed
and
let's
suppose
which
is
unlikely
that
he
would
have
been
within
the
quota,
does
this
section
of
the
statute
relive
him
from
the
consequences
in
having
been
a
communist
or
a
tubercular?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
am
asking
if
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
you
got
to
help
me
a
little
more
than
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
interested
in
what
the
board
would
say.
i
am
interested
only
on
what
the
effect
of
the
statute.
you
told
us
that
unless
that
if
the
fellow
is
not
eligible
within
that
quota
then
this
provision
in
the
statute
does
not
help
him.
now
what
i
am
asking
is
suppose
he
is
not
intelligible
because
he
was
communist
or
a
tubercular
or
a
criminal
and
he
has
made
a
false
statement
in
those
respect,
the
statute
help
him
there.
justice
abe
fortas
well
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
the
statute
means
by
your
adversaries
say
that
the
effect
of
this
provision
in
the
statute
is
to
allow
a
person
to
stay
in
this
country
if
he
has
gotten
in
by
means
of
false
statement
even
though
he
was
not
eligible
--
his
number
had
not
come
up
within
the
quota
you
say,
but
that
if
he
was
a
communist,
if
he
had
entered
this
disqualifications
that
he
would
be
deportable,
now
that's
their
position
as
i
understand
it
your
position
is
in
précised
conflict
on
each
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
you're
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
just
say
that
the
immigrant
could
stay
in
this
country
despite
the
false
affidavit,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
is
personally
disqualified
of
his
being
communist
or
tubercular
on
the
one
hand
or
that
if
he
could
stay
in
this
country
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
was
outside
of
the
quota.
so
lets
just
take
one
of
the
other
those
who
may
have
take
both
of
them
that
given
much
meaning
for
this
provision
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
otherwise
admissible
on
all
stores.
that
is
to
say
he
was
in
the
quota,
you're
not
a
communist.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
tubercular,
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
the
government's
position
if
i
understand
it
is
that
he
total
effect
of
this
provision
in
the
statute
in
the
sole
fact
of
this
provision
of
this
statute
is
to
excuse
the
false
statement
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
but
could
you
imagine
any
situation
in
which
the
service
could
order
to
deport
somebody
for
false
statement
that
would
be
waived
under
what
you
say
is
a
correct
construction
of
provision.
it
seems
to
me
again
that
now
that
i
think
i
am
clear
about
your
position
which
you
are
saying
is
that
the
statute
waives
the
making
of
the
false
statement
only
whether
false
statement
does
not
relate
to
matters
of
admissibility
in
other
words
where
the
person
as
of
the
time
of
entry
in
order
for
the
person
who
have
made
the
most
statements
here
despite
the
statute,
the
person
has
to
show
that
he
had
--
the
number
was
available
within
the
quota.
he
has
to
show
that
he
was
not
a
communist.
he's
got
to
show
that
he
is
not
tubercular
and
all
the
rest
of
those
qualifications.
so
that
the
waiver
would
relate
only
to
the
area
of
unnecessary
perjury,
that
we
have
talked
about
this
morning.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we're
trying
to
find
the
meaning
of
this
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
with
the
policy
that
if
somebody
from
austria
or
let's
say
italy
came
across
the
mexican
border
and
he
said
i
am
a
mexican
and
that
was
false
and
then
under
you
construction
he's
deportable
despite
the
fact
that
he
has
a
family
here.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
as
i
read.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
read
those
exceptions
with
all
due
respect,
those
instances
you've
cited
where
the
statute
might
have
a
meaningful
application
it
seems
to
me
that
mostly
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
week.
justice
abe
fortas
but
general
on
the
other
hand
can
you
suggest
a
type
of
misrepresentation
or
fraudulent
statement
that
would
be
material
and
that
would
not
affect
his
admissibility
as
in
the
time
of
entry.
now,
what
kind
of
thing
could
come
as
it
contemplated
here
if
it
didn't
relate
to
his
qualification
for
entry?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
read
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
these
categories
would
or
might
very
well
affect
his
admissibility
as
of
the
time
of
entry
and
in
circumstances
are
very
much
like
this
case
or
the
next
case
the
scott
case
that
were
treating
up
next
when
he
says
pass
activities
well,
suppose
there's
a
misrepresentation
about
his
communist
party
affiliation
in
the
past.
wouldn't
that
affect
his
eligibility
as
of
the
time
of
entry?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
here
this
fellow
said
that
he
is
a
good
mechanic
on
foreign
cars,
that's
what
he
said.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
there's
been
a
finding
that
makes
it
clear
that
he
wasn't
a
mechanic
--
automobile
mechanic
or
something
like
that.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
so
he
was
allowed
coming
in
this
country
and
he's
been
working
ever
since
then
but
not
as
a
mechanic
on
foreign
cars,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
agency
started
out
as
the
(inaudible)
on
foreign
cars
but
why
is
that
different
from
some
--
any
of
these
other
situations?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now,
suppose
a
mexican
says
that
he's
got
a
thousand
dollars
or
whatever
to
acquire
him
and
he
then
get
but
for
that
misrepresentation,
he
couldn't
get
any
either.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
mean
to
say
that
if
this
statute,
the
statutory
provision
and
should
be
confined
misrepresentations
that
are
not
material
and
not
important
because
they
are
subsequently
corrected.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
a
misrepresentation
that
would
affect
his
eligibility
for
entry
as
of
the
time
he
made
it.
justice
abe
fortas
the
next
case
is
not
a
quota
case,
the
scott
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
she
made
some
misrepresentations
about
her
marital
status.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
take
a
lot
of
your
time
but
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this
now.
is
the
only
qualification
which
supports
the
government
contends
on
which
and
he
seems
to
be
the
wording
of
the
statute,
that
the
immigrant
has
to
have
been
eligible
for
entry
as
a
matter
of
quota.
now,
if
that
is
satisfied
then
you
construe
the
statutory
language
as
in
effect
the
excusing
or
waiving
any
other
misrepresentations
of
whatever
nature.
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
the
only
limit
--
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
only
limitation
is
the
--
is
that
the
person
must
have
been
eligible
for
entry
as
a
numerical
manner
under
the
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that's
a
kind
of
an
importance
as
to
say
whether
the
government
says
that
that
language
is
limited
only
by
a
quota
consideration.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
i'm
talking
about
what
does
this
statute
mean
and
what
does
this
statute
says.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
will
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
assume
there
wouldn't
be
any
misunderstanding
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
would
assume
a
lesson
until
otherwise
advised
by
you
that
the
government's
position
is
that
you
don't
--
there
are
no
other,
in
no
other
situations
where
you
go
to
the
basic
circumstances
at
the
time
of
entry
except
as
to
a
matter
of
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
seem
to
me
that
would
describe
the
statute
that
it's
the
only
kind
of
a
misrepresentation
that
a
person
is
likely
to
make
as
one
that
relates
to
in
the
terms
of
admissibility.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
when
you
talk
about
quota
system,
you're
talking
about
the
basic
quota
system,
aren't
you?
for
example,
at
the
time
that
this
respondent
came
into
the
country
was
there
a
numerical
limitation
on
the
number
of
skilled
people
who
could
be
brought
in
over
the
quota?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
a
number
of
them.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
is
it
your
position
then
that
this
misrepresentation
could
not
be
waived
because
he
could
not
--
because
out
of
the
existence
of
this
particular
specific
quota
for
skilled
persons?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
certainly
could,
if
he
had
in
fact
then
a
skilled
person,
he
would
come
within
that
part
of
the
quota.
oh!
yes,
yes.
yes,
no
question.
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
understand
your
position,
perhaps
i
don't,
it
is
that
you
would
have
to
qualify
that
unless
there
was
an
open
number
in
the
basic
quota
system
for
non-skilled
people
that
this
probably
is
deportable.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we're
not
--
that's
right.
that
is
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
other
hand,
that
there
had
been
a
--
if
there
had
been
some
open
numbers
in
this
basic
quota,
presumably
this
probably
wouldn't
have
to
lie.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he'd
just
apply
for
a
quota
number
and
come
in
under
the
regular
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
believe
that
that's
what
the
statute
means.
justice
abe
fortas
except
that
if
you
forget
about
it
you
waive
this
misrepresentation
then
you
can
–-
and
if
you
waive
that
misrepresentation,
i
assume
that
otherwise
in
fact
waive
it,
perhaps
and
arrive
to
the
assumption
that
fellow
was
in
fact
a
skilled
mechanic.
he
came
in
under
this
special
quota
for
skilled
mechanics.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
it
and
then
the
question
is
whether
that
language
can
be
construed
in
that
fashion
which
substantially
narrows
it
down.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
doing
is
--
what
you're
doing
is
on
this
theory
you
may
be
coming
close
to
waiving
unnecessary
perjury
but
not
waiving
necessary
perjury.
justice
abe
fortas
well
suppose
he's
subject
to
prosecution
for
false
statement
and
a
name?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
question
i
am
really
asking
you
is
this,
i
assume
that
underlying
this
rather
remarkable
provision
is
a
desire
to
protect
the
family
entity
which
has
established
itself
in
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
assume
too
there
is
not
a
desire
to
benefit
somebody
who
files
a
false
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
what
i
am
really
asking
you
is
whether
it
can
be
considered
that
what
congress
has
done
is
to
say
that
in
those
cases,
the
recourse
of
the
government
the
punished
person
for
false
statement
is
to
resort
to
the
criminal
process
rather
than
to
the
process
of
deportation
which
would
result
in
disrupting
a
family
unity,
does
that
or
does
it
not
accord
with
your
understanding
of
the
general
theory
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
mean
because
he
was
otherwise
qualified?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
he
was
not
otherwise
qualified
and
his
in
deference
to
my
brother
brennan.
justice
abe
fortas
what
allotment
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
their
adversaries
in
these
two
cases,
they
say
that
it's
used
in
these
other
places,
so
as
not
to
include
the
quota
and
the
corner
case
of
restrictions,
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
in
connection
with
the
use
of
the
phrase
otherwise
admissible.
justice
abe
fortas
oh
that's
what
i
am
talking
about.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
your
adversaries,
they
are
saying
that
wherever
this
phrase
has
been
used,
otherwise
admissible,
it
refers
to
these
qualifications
other
than
quota.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general
may
i
ask
you
again,
what
is
your
position
exactly
in
the
case.
suppose
he
had
been
a
communist
(inaudible)
and
he
has
filed
an
affidavit
or
representing
that
he
was
not
a
communist
or
that
he
has
not
a
tubercular
and
an
affidavit
had
been
posed
and
let's
suppose
which
is
unlikely
that
he
would
have
been
within
the
quota,
does
this
section
of
the
statute
relive
him
from
the
consequences
in
having
been
a
communist
or
a
tubercular?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
am
asking
if
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
you
got
to
help
me
a
little
more
than
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
interested
in
what
the
board
would
say.
i
am
interested
only
on
what
the
effect
of
the
statute.
you
told
us
that
unless
that
if
the
fellow
is
not
eligible
within
that
quota
then
this
provision
in
the
statute
does
not
help
him.
now
what
i
am
asking
is
suppose
he
is
not
intelligible
because
he
was
communist
or
a
tubercular
or
a
criminal
and
he
has
made
a
false
statement
in
those
respect,
the
statute
help
him
there.
justice
abe
fortas
well
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
the
statute
means
by
your
adversaries
say
that
the
effect
of
this
provision
in
the
statute
is
to
allow
a
person
to
stay
in
this
country
if
he
has
gotten
in
by
means
of
false
statement
even
though
he
was
not
eligible
--
his
number
had
not
come
up
within
the
quota
you
say,
but
that
if
he
was
a
communist,
if
he
had
entered
this
disqualifications
that
he
would
be
deportable,
now
that's
their
position
as
i
understand
it
your
position
is
in
précised
conflict
on
each
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
you're
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
just
say
that
the
immigrant
could
stay
in
this
country
despite
the
false
affidavit,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
is
personally
disqualified
of
his
being
communist
or
tubercular
on
the
one
hand
or
that
if
he
could
stay
in
this
country
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
was
outside
of
the
quota.
so
lets
just
take
one
of
the
other
those
who
may
have
take
both
of
them
that
given
much
meaning
for
this
provision
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
otherwise
admissible
on
all
stores.
that
is
to
say
he
was
in
the
quota,
you're
not
a
communist.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
tubercular,
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
the
government's
position
if
i
understand
it
is
that
he
total
effect
of
this
provision
in
the
statute
in
the
sole
fact
of
this
provision
of
this
statute
is
to
excuse
the
false
statement
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
but
could
you
imagine
any
situation
in
which
the
service
could
order
to
deport
somebody
for
false
statement
that
would
be
waived
under
what
you
say
is
a
correct
construction
of
provision.
it
seems
to
me
again
that
now
that
i
think
i
am
clear
about
your
position
which
you
are
saying
is
that
the
statute
waives
the
making
of
the
false
statement
only
whether
false
statement
does
not
relate
to
matters
of
admissibility
in
other
words
where
the
person
as
of
the
time
of
entry
in
order
for
the
person
who
have
made
the
most
statements
here
despite
the
statute,
the
person
has
to
show
that
he
had
--
the
number
was
available
within
the
quota.
he
has
to
show
that
he
was
not
a
communist.
he's
got
to
show
that
he
is
not
tubercular
and
all
the
rest
of
those
qualifications.
so
that
the
waiver
would
relate
only
to
the
area
of
unnecessary
perjury,
that
we
have
talked
about
this
morning.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we're
trying
to
find
the
meaning
of
this
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
with
the
policy
that
if
somebody
from
austria
or
let's
say
italy
came
across
the
mexican
border
and
he
said
i
am
a
mexican
and
that
was
false
and
then
under
you
construction
he's
deportable
despite
the
fact
that
he
has
a
family
here.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
as
i
read.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
read
those
exceptions
with
all
due
respect,
those
instances
you've
cited
where
the
statute
might
have
a
meaningful
application
it
seems
to
me
that
mostly
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
week.
