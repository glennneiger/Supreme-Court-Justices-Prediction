mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
associate
justices
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
feels
that
the
issue
is
concisely
stated
on
page
17
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
i
quote
from
that,
in
short,
to
be
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry,
the
applicant
for
relief
under
section
241
(f)
must
show
that
he
could
have
been
admitted
even
if
he
had
not
lied.
an
alien
like
respondent
errico
could
not
meet
the
quota
requirements
because
he
cannot
make
that
showing.
in
other
words
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
errico
in
this
case
because
the
truth
of
the
fact
is
that
he
is
not
a
specialized
mechanic
cannot
enter.
now
it
is
respondent's
position
that
to
interpret
241
(f)
in
this
manner
is
to
render
it
meaningless,
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress
and
to
inhibit
purpose
of
the
act.
respondent
contends
what
judge
jones
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
that
in
the
scott
case
i
believe
or
smith,
smith
that
the
words
otherwise
admissible
as
used
in
241
(f)
are
qualitatively
restrictive
but
not
quantitatively
restrictive.
all
of
section
7
of
the
act
which
is
the
predecessor
of
241
(f)
which
is
the
section
we're
now
dealing
with
is
set
forth
in
the
1957
u.s.
code
congressional
and
administrative
news
at
page
709
under
the
heading
nonquota
status.
respondent
in
supporting
his
position
that
otherwise
admissible
is
quantitatively
restrictive
relies
heavily
on
the
presumption
that
241
(f)
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
a
special
class
of
mexican
nationals
and
the
fact
that
they
were
nonquota
immigrants.
it
is
our
position
that
the
mexican
nationals
were
only
one
of
a
group
of
an
entire
defined
class
that
were
contemplated
by
congress.
a
review
of
the
house
report
no.
1199
of
the
judiciary
committee
upon
the
1957
u.s.
code
administrative
news
page
2016
reveals
that
section
7
of
september
11,
57th
amendment
to
the
immigration,
the
nationality
act
was
enacted
for
two
general
class,
subsection
(b)
for
displaced
persons
and
other
immigrants
who
entered
the
united
states
immediately
following
world
war
ii
and
subsection
(a)
for
spouses,
parents,
children
and
children
of
united
states
citizens
or
local
resident
aliens
who
seek
admission
to
the
united
states
and
who
may
have
misrepresented
their
place
of
birth,
national
immigrant
status
and
the
like
if
their
exclusion
would
work
in
extreme
hardship
on
their
family.
the
latter
category
included
mexican
nationals
who
entered
the
united
states
during
a
period
when
border
control
operations
suffered
from
laxity
who
later
established
the
family
in
this
country
and
were
subsequently
found
to
reside
illegally.
approximately
two
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
7
border
control
forces
had
been
strengthened
and
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
had
intensified
its
efforts
in
rounding
up
illegal
entrance.
the
immigration
service
argues
that
because
congress
contemplated
relief
for
these
mexicans
and
because
they
were
not
then
and
are
not
now
subject
to
quota
limitations
otherwise
admissible
is
quantitatively
restrictive
as
well
as
qualitatively
restrictively.
now,
section
7
subsection
(b)
of
the
1957
act
dealing
with
refugees
and
displaced
persons
specifically
refers
to
them
as
entrance.
now,
this
is
part
of
the
same
act
subsection
(b)
of
section
7.
and
it
states
referring
to
them
admitted
to
the
united
states
between
december
26
and
november
1,
1954
and
misrepresented,
goes
on
to
say
it's
misrepresented
their
nationality
place
of
birth
their
identity
etcetera.
now,
this
portion
was
made
discretionary
upon
the
attorney
general
and
was
specifically
placed
there
for
displaced
persons
entering
this
country
during
a
specific
period
of
time.
now
unlike
section
(b),
the
first
sentence
which
we
referred
to
now
which
became
241
(f)
and
which
the
immigration
service
was
feels
enacted
specifically
for
the
mexican
national
in
no
place
referred
to
them
specifically
or
in
any
way
mentioned
then
nor
does
it
mention
any
dates
concerning
the
border
crossing
incidents
referred
to
or
anything
of
the
like.
now
the
house
report
1199
found
in
1957
u.s.
code
congressional
and
administrative
news
at
page
2024
referring
to
this
indicates
as
follows.
in
respect
to
expulsion
of
aliens
who
are
spouses,
parents,
children
of
the
united
states
citizen
who
are
lawfully
resident
aliens
who
are
already
in
the
united
states,
misrepresentations
of
any
documentation
for
entry
would
not
be
a
ground
for
deportation
if
the
aliens
were
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
under
the
immigration
laws.
the
latter
category
of
aliens
includes
mostly
mexican
nationals
who
are
during
the
time
went
border
control
operation
suffered
from
regrettable
likes
that
they
were
able
to
enter
the
united
states,
established
families
in
this
country
and
were
subsequently
found
to
reside
illegally.
now,
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
for
the
house
and
the
senate
have
a
considerable
number
of
private
bills
before
them
which
the
conduct
of
such
aliens
considering
their
family
situation
would
be
condoned.
a
great
number
of
such
private
bills
passed
the
congress
and
were
enacted
in
the
law
the
last
few
years.
it
appears
to
the
committee
as
it
is
unfair
to
improperly
commit
the
benefit
of
legislative
relief
solely
to
a
few
selected
individuals
who
are
in
a
position
to
reach
congress
for
redraft.
it
is
felt
that
the
humanitarian
approach
should
be
extended
to
an
entire
defined
class
of
aliens
rather
than
to
selected
individuals.
now,
they
don't
in
any
way
refer
to
mexicans
and
then
in
the
1961
amendment
to
this
act
the
house
judiciary
committee
commented
that
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
subsection
(b)
which
referred
to
displaced
persons
and
persons
that
are
trying
to
escape
communism
and
so
the
1961
amendment
deleted
that
subsection
(b),
no
longer
referred
to
them
at
all.
subsection
(a)
though,
the
first
part
of
the
act
referring
to
the
mexican
nationals
remained
in
the
act.
now,
certainly
it's
nowhere
been
argued
that
in
1961
the
need
for
the
mexicans
continued.
however,
it
remained
in
the
law,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
remains
in
the
1965
law
exactly
as
it
was
in
1957.
it
has
never
been
repealed
and
the
need
for
it
if
it
were
simply
just
for
mexicans
i
think
certainly
by
now
would
have
passed.
but
as
i
indicated
before
the
language
of
it
it's
absolutely
general
and
therefore
we
think
that
if
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said
when
it
wanted
to
expand
that
to
an
entire
defined
class
rather
than
to
any
specific
group.
now,
otherwise
admissible
and
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
this
argument
but
in
the
scott
case
has
an
excellent
argument
in
it
concerning
the
present
241
(f)
as
compared
to
the
last
section
of
section
7
as
it
appears
and
we
wholeheartedly
agree
with
their
position
and
feel
that
it
reflects
the
intent
of
congress
again
as
we
have
stated.
now,
otherwise
admissible,
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
act
also,
241
(f)
and
241
(h)
are
set
forth
in
the
1957
u.s.
code
congressional
and
administrative
news
at
page
709.
now
under
the
heading
immigration
nonquota
status
indicating
to
me
that
clearly
that
that
is
not
quantitative,
it's
not
considered
under
a
quantitative
section.
it's
under
the
nonquota
section.
now,
another
part
of
the
act
section
12
of
the
1957
amendment
sets
forth
another
example
of
otherwise
admissible
meaning
qualitative
better
than
quantitative
and
i
quote
from
that
directly
“any
alien
eligible
for
quota
immigration
status
under
the
provisions
of
section
23
--
203
(a)
(1),
(2),
or
(3)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
section
1153
(a)
(1),
(2),
(3)
of
title
8
on
the
basis
of
petition
approved
by
the
attorney
general
prior
to
1957,
shall
be
held
a
nonquota
immigrant
and
if
otherwise
admissible
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
shall
be
issued
a
nonquota
immigrant
visa.
now
there
clearly
it
stating
that
if
he's
otherwise
admissible
he
won't
be
considered
a
nonquota
immigrant.
now,
judge
duniway
in
his
concurring
opinion
points
out
another
section
211
(a)
and
from
that
section
i
would
like
to
quote
the
following,
“no
immigrant
shall
be
admitted
into
united
states
unless
at
the
time
of
his
application
for
admission
he
(1)
has
a
valid
unexpired,
(2)
he's
properly
chargeable
to
the
quota
specified
in
the
immigration
visa,
(3)
is
a
nonquota
immigrant
if
specified
as
such
in
the
immigrant
visa,
(4)
is
the
proper
status
on
the
quota
specified
in
the
immigrant
visa,
and
then
(5)
is
otherwise
admissible.
so
again
clearly
the
words
otherwise
admissible
here
is
qualitative
rather
than
quantitative.
now,
your
honor,
example
section
5
without
reading
it
entirely
uses
the
word
exactly
the
same
way
referring
to
it
as
quantitative
exactly
the
same
way
referring
to
it
as
quantitative
rather
than
qualitative.
now,
some
questions
were
raised
about
the
family
status
of
the
respondent
and
he
is
the
eldest
of
seven
children.
six
of
these
children
entered
the
united
states
with
the
mother
and
father
and
were
admitted
because
they
were
under
21
years
of
age.
he
being
the
oldest
boy
and
then
over
21
years
of
age
could
not
come
in.
his
father
and
mother
are
not
citizens
at
this
time,
so
therefore
do
not
fit
in
the
nonquota
section
of
the
1965
act.
they
would
be
--
he
would
be
under
the
1965
act
admissible
if
under
the
fifth
preference
as
a
brother
and
sister
are
citizens.
i
think
the
numerical
limitations
for
that
group
is
40,800.
now,
as
i
indicated
his
mother
and
father
are
lawfully
residing
alien
residents.
they
are
not
citizens.
his
oldest,
the
next
oldest
boy
is
leo.
he
resides
in
portland,
oregon
also
and
is
a
citizen,
is
married
and
has
two
children
eight
and
seven
in
school.
his
oldest
sister
anna,
28,
is
a
citizen
resides
in
portland,
oregon,
has
one
child
and
is
pregnant
with
another.
the
next
is
antoinette,
25,
she
is
not
a
citizen.
she's
married,
living
in
portland,
oregon
and
is
expecting
a
child.
the
next
brother
pat
errico,
23
years
of
age,
works
in
portland,
is
a
citizen,
was
recently
discharged
from
two-year
service
in
the
army,
honorably
discharged.
paul
errico
is
19,
maria
errico
is
17,
living
with
her
folks,
attending
parkrose
high
school
in
portland,
oregon.
all
of
his
close
relatives,
all
of
his
aunts,
all
of
his
uncles,
all
live
and
reside
in
the
united
states
most
of
them
portland,
oregon
with
the
exception
of
two,
i
think
the
brother,
one
of
his
father's
brother
and
one
of
his
mother's
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
he
was
32
when
he
entered
but
he
was
over
21
when
his
folks
came
so
he
stayed
behind.
and
then
came
in
on
this
--
came
in
on
this
special
–-
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
right.
now,
we
feel
that
congress
contemplated
this,
a
non
discretionary
relief
specifically
for
a
man
in
errico's
category.
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
in
the
1961
and
1965
amendments
to
the
1957
legislations
is
that
in
this
particular
category,
in
connection
with
deportation
they
removed
the
discretionary
powers
of
the
attorney
general
and
made
it
absolute
and
we
feel
that
errico
is
entitled
to
this
protection
and
we
certainly
whether
or
not
he
would
be
eligible
under
any
of
these
other
categories
of
course
would
depend
on
the
number
of
applicants
from
italy
that
have
made,
filed
petitions
and
also
would
depend
under
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
and
we
feel
that
since
he
has
an
absolute
right
and
since
he
has
established
the
roots
in
this
country
that
congress
intended
this
legislation
to
protect
that
it
is
not
like
in
one
of
your
very
recent
cases
where
two
seamen,
i
think
it's
one
of
the
advance
sheets
of
two
seamen
were
here
on
a
temporary
visit
and
a
woman
was
pregnant
and
the
court
then
held
then
that
they
just
had
one
child
and
certainly
they
haven't
established
the
roots
necessary
for
the
relief
and
that
was
a
discretionary
type
relief
anyway
i
think
under
11
(c).
but
certainly
in
this
case
to
send
mr.
errico
back
to
italy
would
work
an
extreme
hardship
on
his
family
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
you
mean
in
the
criminal
courts,
your
honor?
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
mr.
justice.
he
may
well
be
but
certainly
i
am
sure
that
he
would
welcome
that
if
not
that
he
could
stay
there.
that
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
well
he
would,
i
am
sure
he
would
be
able
to
--
i
think
that
we
could
make
any
court
understand
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
very
true.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
i
would
think
it
would
certainly
be
the
more
humane
approach
to
a
problem
if
some
redress
had
to
be
made.
i
think
though
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
that's
true
mr.
justice.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
i
think
that
congress
contemplated
that
and
thought
that
if
this
does
happen
and
if
the
alien
is
in
this
country
long
enough
to
establish
family
roots
that
then
he
should
be
protected
by
section
7
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
to
have
reward
anybody
for
committing
fraud
at
all.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
well
there
was
some
question
mr.
justice
warren
but
i
appeared
with
him
at
the
immig
--
and
he
speaks
only
italian
and
very
broken
english.
i
understand
italian
somewhat
but
not
really
well
and
we
had
three
sessions
and
i
frankly,
right
now,
don't
know
exactly
what
happened
and
so
but
in
any
event
he
was
not
a
specialized
mechanic
and
we
admitted
that.
we
tried
to
through
an
interpreter
and
through
other
means
to
show
that
he
probably
did
not
understand.
mr.
errico
to
this
date
feels
that
he
is
a
skilled
mechanic.
he
is
not
--
he
has
such
a
--
his
attitude
is
such
that
he
would
never
and
could
never
be
a
skilled
mechanic.
he
doesn't
know
--
he
can't
even
do
the
most
simple
things
but
he
went
to
this
school
to
get
this
particular
certificate
and
he
felt
that
he
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes,
he
got
the
certificate,
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes,
he
did
but
we
--
the
reason
why
we
didn't
attack
that
position
very
much
is
that
because
he
was
not
specialized
mechanic
and
his
employer
submitted
an
affidavit
to
that
effect
i
think
that
there
is
some
serious
question
whether
he
committed
willful
fraud
in
this
matter
but
he
certainly
was
not
a
specialized
mechanic.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
i
don't
recall.
he
attended
over
a
long
period
of
time
but
not
for
any
great
period
of
time
at
any
time.
he
was
not
paid.
he
was
an
apprentice.
and
he
would
go
in
his
spare
time
to
help
other
mechanics
and
to
try
to
learn
this
work.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
alright,
we
feel
that
this
simply
removes
the
quantitative
barrier.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
any
of
the
other
qualitative
restrictions,
communist,
prostitute
moral
turpitude
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes.
but
he
falsely
swearing
to
that,
excusing
his
fraud
and
the
fact
that
he
had
lied
would
not
remove
the
qualitative
restriction.
while
it
would
remove
the
quantitative
and
get
him
pass
the
quota
system
it
would
not
remove
that
the
fact
that
he
was
not
otherwise
admissible
on
a
qualitative
basis.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
no.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
you're
exactly
referring
to
the
bufalino
case.
it
would
only
remove
the
quantitative
restrictions
and
in
fact
in
the
bufalino
case,
he
was
a
nonquota
immigrant.
and
so
that
if
by
removing
the
quantitative
requirement
you
are
still
otherwise
inadmissible
because
of
some
qualitative
restrictions
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
that's
right,
it
is
not.
not
if
those
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
no
the
quota.
you
may
come
in
under
as
a
nonquota
immigrant
or
you
can
come
in
as
a
preferred
quota
immigrant.
now,
we
simply
say
that
the
only
thing
that
section
7
protects
you
against
is
if
you
lied
in
order
to
make
a
different
preference
in
order
to
avoid
the
quota
system
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
that
is
not
excused
by
section
7.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
perhaps
under
making
myself
clear
by
saying
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
the
lie
itself
is
excused
in
either
situation.
however,
if
the
truth
of
the
matter,
makes
you
otherwise
admissible
under
some
of
these
sections
of
the
qualitative
sections
which
you
referred
to
prostitute,
well
then
that
is
not
removed
because
you
are
not
otherwise
admissible
qualitatively
but
if
you're
lying
simply
--
he
was
not
a
prostitute
of
course,
he
was
not
involved
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
nothing.
none
of
this
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
he
was
not
a
skilled
mechanic.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
but
it
is
not
a
qualitative
restriction.
it's
simply
--
the
only
thing
that
that
does,
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
section
14
of
the
qualitative
section
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
right
and
the
only
reason
why
he
would
not
have
been
otherwise
admissible
would
be
that
his
regular
quota
was
over
subscribed
and
that
statute
forgives
that
and
nothing
else.
it's
quantitative
and
not
qualitative.
even
in
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
right.
you
know
i
would
like
to
mention
the
bufalino
case
one
more
time
because
there
is
a
case
where
there
was
no
quota
justice
fortas
at
all.
he
came
in
as
nonimmigrant
quota
on
s
nonimmigrant
quota
and
yet
he
lied
about
being
a
communist.
well
they
deported
him
and
section
7
did
not
help
him
because
it
was
a
qualitative
and
rather
than
quantitative.
this
is
all
what
we're
saying.our
position
doesn't
come
into
conflict
with
any
other
cases
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
he
was
not
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
well
unfortunately
the
ninth
circuit
did
go
up
in
a
little
tangent
on
one
portion
of
it.
but
i
think
basically
speaking
that
they
also
use
a
qualitative
on
that.
and
i
think
this
is
that
there
have
been
six
circuit
judge
--
court
of
appeals
judges
that
had
looked
at
this
question
now
and
four
of
them
agree
with
the
respondent's
position.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
associate
justices
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
feels
that
the
issue
is
concisely
stated
on
page
17
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
i
quote
from
that,
in
short,
to
be
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry,
the
applicant
for
relief
under
section
241
(f)
must
show
that
he
could
have
been
admitted
even
if
he
had
not
lied.
an
alien
like
respondent
errico
could
not
meet
the
quota
requirements
because
he
cannot
make
that
showing.
in
other
words
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
errico
in
this
case
because
the
truth
of
the
fact
is
that
he
is
not
a
specialized
mechanic
cannot
enter.
now
it
is
respondent's
position
that
to
interpret
241
(f)
in
this
manner
is
to
render
it
meaningless,
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress
and
to
inhibit
purpose
of
the
act.
respondent
contends
what
judge
jones
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
that
in
the
scott
case
i
believe
or
smith,
smith
that
the
words
otherwise
admissible
as
used
in
241
(f)
are
qualitatively
restrictive
but
not
quantitatively
restrictive.
all
of
section
7
of
the
act
which
is
the
predecessor
of
241
(f)
which
is
the
section
we're
now
dealing
with
is
set
forth
in
the
1957
u.s.
code
congressional
and
administrative
news
at
page
709
under
the
heading
nonquota
status.
respondent
in
supporting
his
position
that
otherwise
admissible
is
quantitatively
restrictive
relies
heavily
on
the
presumption
that
241
(f)
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
a
special
class
of
mexican
nationals
and
the
fact
that
they
were
nonquota
immigrants.
it
is
our
position
that
the
mexican
nationals
were
only
one
of
a
group
of
an
entire
defined
class
that
were
contemplated
by
congress.
a
review
of
the
house
report
no.
1199
of
the
judiciary
committee
upon
the
1957
u.s.
code
administrative
news
page
2016
reveals
that
section
7
of
september
11,
57th
amendment
to
the
immigration,
the
nationality
act
was
enacted
for
two
general
class,
subsection
(b)
for
displaced
persons
and
other
immigrants
who
entered
the
united
states
immediately
following
world
war
ii
and
subsection
(a)
for
spouses,
parents,
children
and
children
of
united
states
citizens
or
local
resident
aliens
who
seek
admission
to
the
united
states
and
who
may
have
misrepresented
their
place
of
birth,
national
immigrant
status
and
the
like
if
their
exclusion
would
work
in
extreme
hardship
on
their
family.
the
latter
category
included
mexican
nationals
who
entered
the
united
states
during
a
period
when
border
control
operations
suffered
from
laxity
who
later
established
the
family
in
this
country
and
were
subsequently
found
to
reside
illegally.
approximately
two
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
7
border
control
forces
had
been
strengthened
and
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
had
intensified
its
efforts
in
rounding
up
illegal
entrance.
the
immigration
service
argues
that
because
congress
contemplated
relief
for
these
mexicans
and
because
they
were
not
then
and
are
not
now
subject
to
quota
limitations
otherwise
admissible
is
quantitatively
restrictive
as
well
as
qualitatively
restrictively.
now,
section
7
subsection
(b)
of
the
1957
act
dealing
with
refugees
and
displaced
persons
specifically
refers
to
them
as
entrance.
now,
this
is
part
of
the
same
act
subsection
(b)
of
section
7.
and
it
states
referring
to
them
admitted
to
the
united
states
between
december
26
and
november
1,
1954
and
misrepresented,
goes
on
to
say
it's
misrepresented
their
nationality
place
of
birth
their
identity
etcetera.
now,
this
portion
was
made
discretionary
upon
the
attorney
general
and
was
specifically
placed
there
for
displaced
persons
entering
this
country
during
a
specific
period
of
time.
now
unlike
section
(b),
the
first
sentence
which
we
referred
to
now
which
became
241
(f)
and
which
the
immigration
service
was
feels
enacted
specifically
for
the
mexican
national
in
no
place
referred
to
them
specifically
or
in
any
way
mentioned
then
nor
does
it
mention
any
dates
concerning
the
border
crossing
incidents
referred
to
or
anything
of
the
like.
now
the
house
report
1199
found
in
1957
u.s.
code
congressional
and
administrative
news
at
page
2024
referring
to
this
indicates
as
follows.
in
respect
to
expulsion
of
aliens
who
are
spouses,
parents,
children
of
the
united
states
citizen
who
are
lawfully
resident
aliens
who
are
already
in
the
united
states,
misrepresentations
of
any
documentation
for
entry
would
not
be
a
ground
for
deportation
if
the
aliens
were
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
under
the
immigration
laws.
the
latter
category
of
aliens
includes
mostly
mexican
nationals
who
are
during
the
time
went
border
control
operation
suffered
from
regrettable
likes
that
they
were
able
to
enter
the
united
states,
established
families
in
this
country
and
were
subsequently
found
to
reside
illegally.
now,
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
for
the
house
and
the
senate
have
a
considerable
number
of
private
bills
before
them
which
the
conduct
of
such
aliens
considering
their
family
situation
would
be
condoned.
a
great
number
of
such
private
bills
passed
the
congress
and
were
enacted
in
the
law
the
last
few
years.
it
appears
to
the
committee
as
it
is
unfair
to
improperly
commit
the
benefit
of
legislative
relief
solely
to
a
few
selected
individuals
who
are
in
a
position
to
reach
congress
for
redraft.
it
is
felt
that
the
humanitarian
approach
should
be
extended
to
an
entire
defined
class
of
aliens
rather
than
to
selected
individuals.
now,
they
don't
in
any
way
refer
to
mexicans
and
then
in
the
1961
amendment
to
this
act
the
house
judiciary
committee
commented
that
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
subsection
(b)
which
referred
to
displaced
persons
and
persons
that
are
trying
to
escape
communism
and
so
the
1961
amendment
deleted
that
subsection
(b),
no
longer
referred
to
them
at
all.
subsection
(a)
though,
the
first
part
of
the
act
referring
to
the
mexican
nationals
remained
in
the
act.
now,
certainly
it's
nowhere
been
argued
that
in
1961
the
need
for
the
mexicans
continued.
however,
it
remained
in
the
law,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
remains
in
the
1965
law
exactly
as
it
was
in
1957.
it
has
never
been
repealed
and
the
need
for
it
if
it
were
simply
just
for
mexicans
i
think
certainly
by
now
would
have
passed.
but
as
i
indicated
before
the
language
of
it
it's
absolutely
general
and
therefore
we
think
that
if
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said
when
it
wanted
to
expand
that
to
an
entire
defined
class
rather
than
to
any
specific
group.
now,
otherwise
admissible
and
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
this
argument
but
in
the
scott
case
has
an
excellent
argument
in
it
concerning
the
present
241
(f)
as
compared
to
the
last
section
of
section
7
as
it
appears
and
we
wholeheartedly
agree
with
their
position
and
feel
that
it
reflects
the
intent
of
congress
again
as
we
have
stated.
now,
otherwise
admissible,
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
act
also,
241
(f)
and
241
(h)
are
set
forth
in
the
1957
u.s.
code
congressional
and
administrative
news
at
page
709.
now
under
the
heading
immigration
nonquota
status
indicating
to
me
that
clearly
that
that
is
not
quantitative,
it's
not
considered
under
a
quantitative
section.
it's
under
the
nonquota
section.
now,
another
part
of
the
act
section
12
of
the
1957
amendment
sets
forth
another
example
of
otherwise
admissible
meaning
qualitative
better
than
quantitative
and
i
quote
from
that
directly
“any
alien
eligible
for
quota
immigration
status
under
the
provisions
of
section
23
--
203
(a)
(1),
(2),
or
(3)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
section
1153
(a)
(1),
(2),
(3)
of
title
8
on
the
basis
of
petition
approved
by
the
attorney
general
prior
to
1957,
shall
be
held
a
nonquota
immigrant
and
if
otherwise
admissible
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
shall
be
issued
a
nonquota
immigrant
visa.
now
there
clearly
it
stating
that
if
he's
otherwise
admissible
he
won't
be
considered
a
nonquota
immigrant.
now,
judge
duniway
in
his
concurring
opinion
points
out
another
section
211
(a)
and
from
that
section
i
would
like
to
quote
the
following,
“no
immigrant
shall
be
admitted
into
united
states
unless
at
the
time
of
his
application
for
admission
he
(1)
has
a
valid
unexpired,
(2)
he's
properly
chargeable
to
the
quota
specified
in
the
immigration
visa,
(3)
is
a
nonquota
immigrant
if
specified
as
such
in
the
immigrant
visa,
(4)
is
the
proper
status
on
the
quota
specified
in
the
immigrant
visa,
and
then
(5)
is
otherwise
admissible.
so
again
clearly
the
words
otherwise
admissible
here
is
qualitative
rather
than
quantitative.
now,
your
honor,
example
section
5
without
reading
it
entirely
uses
the
word
exactly
the
same
way
referring
to
it
as
quantitative
exactly
the
same
way
referring
to
it
as
quantitative
rather
than
qualitative.
now,
some
questions
were
raised
about
the
family
status
of
the
respondent
and
he
is
the
eldest
of
seven
children.
six
of
these
children
entered
the
united
states
with
the
mother
and
father
and
were
admitted
because
they
were
under
21
years
of
age.
he
being
the
oldest
boy
and
then
over
21
years
of
age
could
not
come
in.
his
father
and
mother
are
not
citizens
at
this
time,
so
therefore
do
not
fit
in
the
nonquota
section
of
the
1965
act.
they
would
be
--
he
would
be
under
the
1965
act
admissible
if
under
the
fifth
preference
as
a
brother
and
sister
are
citizens.
i
think
the
numerical
limitations
for
that
group
is
40,800.
now,
as
i
indicated
his
mother
and
father
are
lawfully
residing
alien
residents.
they
are
not
citizens.
his
oldest,
the
next
oldest
boy
is
leo.
he
resides
in
portland,
oregon
also
and
is
a
citizen,
is
married
and
has
two
children
eight
and
seven
in
school.
his
oldest
sister
anna,
28,
is
a
citizen
resides
in
portland,
oregon,
has
one
child
and
is
pregnant
with
another.
the
next
is
antoinette,
25,
she
is
not
a
citizen.
she's
married,
living
in
portland,
oregon
and
is
expecting
a
child.
the
next
brother
pat
errico,
23
years
of
age,
works
in
portland,
is
a
citizen,
was
recently
discharged
from
two-year
service
in
the
army,
honorably
discharged.
paul
errico
is
19,
maria
errico
is
17,
living
with
her
folks,
attending
parkrose
high
school
in
portland,
oregon.
all
of
his
close
relatives,
all
of
his
aunts,
all
of
his
uncles,
all
live
and
reside
in
the
united
states
most
of
them
portland,
oregon
with
the
exception
of
two,
i
think
the
brother,
one
of
his
father's
brother
and
one
of
his
mother's
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
he
was
32
when
he
entered
but
he
was
over
21
when
his
folks
came
so
he
stayed
behind.
and
then
came
in
on
this
--
came
in
on
this
special
–-
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
right.
now,
we
feel
that
congress
contemplated
this,
a
non
discretionary
relief
specifically
for
a
man
in
errico's
category.
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
in
the
1961
and
1965
amendments
to
the
1957
legislations
is
that
in
this
particular
category,
in
connection
with
deportation
they
removed
the
discretionary
powers
of
the
attorney
general
and
made
it
absolute
and
we
feel
that
errico
is
entitled
to
this
protection
and
we
certainly
whether
or
not
he
would
be
eligible
under
any
of
these
other
categories
of
course
would
depend
on
the
number
of
applicants
from
italy
that
have
made,
filed
petitions
and
also
would
depend
under
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
and
we
feel
that
since
he
has
an
absolute
right
and
since
he
has
established
the
roots
in
this
country
that
congress
intended
this
legislation
to
protect
that
it
is
not
like
in
one
of
your
very
recent
cases
where
two
seamen,
i
think
it's
one
of
the
advance
sheets
of
two
seamen
were
here
on
a
temporary
visit
and
a
woman
was
pregnant
and
the
court
then
held
then
that
they
just
had
one
child
and
certainly
they
haven't
established
the
roots
necessary
for
the
relief
and
that
was
a
discretionary
type
relief
anyway
i
think
under
11
(c).
but
certainly
in
this
case
to
send
mr.
errico
back
to
italy
would
work
an
extreme
hardship
on
his
family
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
you
mean
in
the
criminal
courts,
your
honor?
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
mr.
justice.
he
may
well
be
but
certainly
i
am
sure
that
he
would
welcome
that
if
not
that
he
could
stay
there.
that
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
well
he
would,
i
am
sure
he
would
be
able
to
--
i
think
that
we
could
make
any
court
understand
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
very
true.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
i
would
think
it
would
certainly
be
the
more
humane
approach
to
a
problem
if
some
redress
had
to
be
made.
i
think
though
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
that's
true
mr.
justice.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
i
think
that
congress
contemplated
that
and
thought
that
if
this
does
happen
and
if
the
alien
is
in
this
country
long
enough
to
establish
family
roots
that
then
he
should
be
protected
by
section
7
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
to
have
reward
anybody
for
committing
fraud
at
all.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
well
there
was
some
question
mr.
justice
warren
but
i
appeared
with
him
at
the
immig
--
and
he
speaks
only
italian
and
very
broken
english.
i
understand
italian
somewhat
but
not
really
well
and
we
had
three
sessions
and
i
frankly,
right
now,
don't
know
exactly
what
happened
and
so
but
in
any
event
he
was
not
a
specialized
mechanic
and
we
admitted
that.
we
tried
to
through
an
interpreter
and
through
other
means
to
show
that
he
probably
did
not
understand.
mr.
errico
to
this
date
feels
that
he
is
a
skilled
mechanic.
he
is
not
--
he
has
such
a
--
his
attitude
is
such
that
he
would
never
and
could
never
be
a
skilled
mechanic.
he
doesn't
know
--
he
can't
even
do
the
most
simple
things
but
he
went
to
this
school
to
get
this
particular
certificate
and
he
felt
that
he
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes,
he
got
the
certificate,
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes,
he
did
but
we
--
the
reason
why
we
didn't
attack
that
position
very
much
is
that
because
he
was
not
specialized
mechanic
and
his
employer
submitted
an
affidavit
to
that
effect
i
think
that
there
is
some
serious
question
whether
he
committed
willful
fraud
in
this
matter
but
he
certainly
was
not
a
specialized
mechanic.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
i
don't
recall.
he
attended
over
a
long
period
of
time
but
not
for
any
great
period
of
time
at
any
time.
he
was
not
paid.
he
was
an
apprentice.
and
he
would
go
in
his
spare
time
to
help
other
mechanics
and
to
try
to
learn
this
work.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
alright,
we
feel
that
this
simply
removes
the
quantitative
barrier.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
any
of
the
other
qualitative
restrictions,
communist,
prostitute
moral
turpitude
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
yes.
but
he
falsely
swearing
to
that,
excusing
his
fraud
and
the
fact
that
he
had
lied
would
not
remove
the
qualitative
restriction.
while
it
would
remove
the
quantitative
and
get
him
pass
the
quota
system
it
would
not
remove
that
the
fact
that
he
was
not
otherwise
admissible
on
a
qualitative
basis.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
no.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
you're
exactly
referring
to
the
bufalino
case.
it
would
only
remove
the
quantitative
restrictions
and
in
fact
in
the
bufalino
case,
he
was
a
nonquota
immigrant.
and
so
that
if
by
removing
the
quantitative
requirement
you
are
still
otherwise
inadmissible
because
of
some
qualitative
restrictions
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
that's
right,
it
is
not.
not
if
those
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
no
the
quota.
you
may
come
in
under
as
a
nonquota
immigrant
or
you
can
come
in
as
a
preferred
quota
immigrant.
now,
we
simply
say
that
the
only
thing
that
section
7
protects
you
against
is
if
you
lied
in
order
to
make
a
different
preference
in
order
to
avoid
the
quota
system
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
that
is
not
excused
by
section
7.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
perhaps
under
making
myself
clear
by
saying
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
the
lie
itself
is
excused
in
either
situation.
however,
if
the
truth
of
the
matter,
makes
you
otherwise
admissible
under
some
of
these
sections
of
the
qualitative
sections
which
you
referred
to
prostitute,
well
then
that
is
not
removed
because
you
are
not
otherwise
admissible
qualitatively
but
if
you're
lying
simply
--
he
was
not
a
prostitute
of
course,
he
was
not
involved
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
nothing.
none
of
this
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
he
was
not
a
skilled
mechanic.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
but
it
is
not
a
qualitative
restriction.
it's
simply
--
the
only
thing
that
that
does,
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
section
14
of
the
qualitative
section
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
right
and
the
only
reason
why
he
would
not
have
been
otherwise
admissible
would
be
that
his
regular
quota
was
over
subscribed
and
that
statute
forgives
that
and
nothing
else.
it's
quantitative
and
not
qualitative.
even
in
--
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
right.
you
know
i
would
like
to
mention
the
bufalino
case
one
more
time
because
there
is
a
case
where
there
was
no
quota
justice
fortas
at
all.
he
came
in
as
nonimmigrant
quota
on
s
nonimmigrant
quota
and
yet
he
lied
about
being
a
communist.
well
they
deported
him
and
section
7
did
not
help
him
because
it
was
a
qualitative
and
rather
than
quantitative.
this
is
all
what
we're
saying.our
position
doesn't
come
into
conflict
with
any
other
cases
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
he
was
not
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
frank
m.
ierulli
well
unfortunately
the
ninth
circuit
did
go
up
in
a
little
tangent
on
one
portion
of
it.
but
i
think
basically
speaking
that
they
also
use
a
qualitative
on
that.
and
i
think
this
is
that
there
have
been
six
circuit
judge
--
court
of
appeals
judges
that
had
looked
at
this
question
now
and
four
of
them
agree
with
the
respondent's
position.
