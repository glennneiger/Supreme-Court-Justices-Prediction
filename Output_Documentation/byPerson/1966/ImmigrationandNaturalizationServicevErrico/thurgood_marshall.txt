mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
two
cases
that
have
been
set
down
one
to
follow
the
other.
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
vacated
the
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
had
affirmed
an
order
of
deportation
issued
against
giuseppe
errico.
errico
had
entered
the
united
states
in
1959
by
fraudulent
representation
made
in
order
to
bypass
the
then
quota
requirements
for
his
native
country
of
italy.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
of
the
second
circuit
in
scott
against
immigration
service
which
is
the
case
to
follow.
the
issue
in
both
cases
is
much
the
same.
it
is
whether
a
relief
provision
of
the
immigration
act
of
1961,
intended
we
think
to
be
a
relatively
narrow
applicability
actually
waives
the
deportation
of
errico.
the
government
contends
that
the
provision
section
241
helps
in
the
immigration
act
does
not
authorize
the
waiver
of
deportation
in
each
of
these
cases.
a
conclusion
we
say
is
supported
by
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
overall
statutory
scheme
of
the
nationality
acts.
as
to
the
facts,
errico
is
now
32,
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy
and
because
at
the
time
he
sought
entry
as
of
the
present
time,
the
italian
quota
was
substantially
oversubscribed.
indeed,
we
point
out
in
the
brief
that
at
the
time
of
his
entry,
the
waiting
list
was
some
162,612
and
he
made
this
false
statement
in
order
to
obtain
entry
into
the
united
states.
he
falsely
represented
that
he
was
a
skilled
mechanic
with
experience
in
repairing
foreign
automobile
and
because
of
that
representation,
he
was
granted
a
first
preference
status
under
the
italian
quota.
and
under
the
then
existing
preference
system
and
those
are
section
203
(a)
and
(1),
he
was
admitted
in
the
united
states
in
october
of
1959
and
he
has
resided
continuously
in
portland,
oregon
since
his
entry.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
recent
provision
of
course
changes
the
whole
quota
system
that's
gone
and
as
of
now
he
could
qualify
to
come
in
but
there's
still
would
be
i
think
it's
20,000
for
italy.
but
as
it
now
stands
we're
applying
the
law
as
it
was
at
the
time
he
came
in
and
at
the
time
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
number,
it's
pretty
hard,
the
best
example,
i
don't
know
how
we
do
it
these
figures
there,
there
are
some
3
million
resident
aliens
in
the
country
as
of
now.
as
to
how
many
of
them
run
to
this,
i
don't
know.
and
--
but
on
the
other
point
if
you're
interested
on
what
would
happen
to
him
if
this
case
stands
and
the
deportation
stands
as
to
the
area
code,
he
has
parents
here
and
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
as
to
whether
they
are
citizens
yet.
and
he
has
brothers
and
sisters
eight
at
least,
at
least
eight
brothers
and
sisters
not
more,
and
as
he
stands
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
preference.
but
while
he's
in
the
united
states,
he
could
ask
for
discretionary
relief
and
he
could
apply
for
adjustment
of
status.
but
that
would
be
under
the
attorney
general
so
it's
not
a
certainty
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
back
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
could.
the
way
i
am
advised
by
the
revenue
service
that
under
245
which
is
8
u.s.
code
1255
he
could
qualify
for
adjustment
of
status
and
the
immigration
quota
for
italy
is
still
pretty
far
back
as
to
this
amount
and
he
would
have
to
qualify
for
some
of
the
preferences
and
that
would
depend
as
to
whether
or
not
his
mother
and
father
are
citizens
or
the
brothers
and
sisters
wouldn't
help
him
too
much
but
we
don't
know
those
facts.
he
would
still
have
to
qualify
under
the
---
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
never
applied
for
it.
and
once
the
deportation
is
ordered
upon
him
then
he
appealed
straight
up.
i
in
the
hearings,
i
don't
see
why
this
was
ever
raised
at
all.
you
might
have
been
but
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
and
they
just
merely
relied
--
errico
relied
on
this
statute
which
is
this
later
statute
which
gives
him
this
absolute
right
to
stay
in
the
country
if
he's
got
a
spouse
or
a
child
who
is
a
citizen.
and
they
relied
on
that
because
you
see
that
does
not
require
the
attorney
general's
waivers
or
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
obviously,
they
didn't
want
to
submit
to
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
that's
the
only
way
i
can
see.
i
am
told
that
even
as
of
now,
that
there
is
a
provision
where
even
if
this
opinion
is
reversed
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
still
is
a
waiver
possibility
but
i
can't
commit
to
attorney
general
as
to
what
he
will
do
and
that
depends
on
the
status
of
his
family
as
of
now
which
we
don't
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
came
here
with
him
and
his
child
was
born
10
months
after
their
arrival,
clearly
an
american
citizen.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he's
otherwise
admissible
no
question
about
that,
he
comes
on
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
both
the
mother
and
father
are
lawfully
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
--
oh
you
mean
as
to
his
existence?
yes.
yes,
sure.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
question
that
he
has
the
familial
ties
efficient
to
qualify
under
that
section.
there's
no
problem
there.
the
only
problem
is
that
one
as
to
what
is
meant
by
the
grounds
for
and
the
whole
argument
between
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
as
to
whether
or
not
that
includes
quota
and
the
word
is
used
over
and
over
again
in
the
ninth
circuit
of
its
automatic
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
we
can
do
that
is
to
go
back
to
the
statute
itself.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
he
must
admit
that
he
could
not
come
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
oversubscribe
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
says
because
otherwise
admissible
providing
you
deliberately
misstate
a
fact.
congress
said
that
you
can
stay
providing
you're
otherwise
admissible
and
otherwise
admissible
does
not
include
the
quota.
that
otherwise
admissible
the
quota,
qualitative
and
quantitative
are
all
the
same,
that's
his
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
we
say
that
congress
couldn't
possible
have
meant
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
have
some
set
out
in
our
brief
in
page
34
and
36
in
our
brief.
we
have
several
possibilities
and
the
--
i
say
quite
frankly
the
only
thing
i'm
sure
of,
it
doesn't
apply
to
cases
of
this
type.
you
notice
down
at
the
bottom
of
34
because
this
particular
act
and
its
immediate
predecessor,
there
were
words
in
the
congress
in
the
reports
and
in
the
debates
that
was
supposed
to
apply
to
mexicans
who
would
come
over
the
line.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
certainly
would
but
we
try
to
explain
it.
we've
got
that
one
here
under
(e).
since
he
was
otherwise
admissible
is
from
misrepresentation
is
waived
by
241
(f).
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
--
i'm
not
sure
but
these
are
possibilities
we
--
we're
not
certain
of
them
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
i
read
the
record,
it
wasn't
contested.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
assume.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
because
but
for
this
misrepresentation,
he
couldn't
have
gotten
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
he
could
have
because
--
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
if
at
the
moment
he
started
across
the
line
somebody
handed
him
a
thousand
dollars,
he
couldn't
come
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
this
man,
you
couldn't
have
handed
him
the
knowledge
of
this
cause.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
the
line
we
are
trying
to
draw
which
is
the
only
line
we
submit
you
can
draw
when
you
look
through.
number
one,
congress
has
never
failed
to
recognize
quotas.
quotas
up
until
recently
had
been
up
a
most
in
any
discussion
of
immigration
legislation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
yes.
sure.
you
see
that
jamaica
was
then
--
wasn't
an
independent
country
when
she
came
in.
it
was
under
great
britain.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
said
her
marital
status
which
gave
her
the
preference
under
the
quota
and
in
this
we
say
that
congress
insists
on
drawing
the
line
on
the
quota
because
if
the
misrepresentation
there's
no
way
for
him
to
be
otherwise
admissible
if
he
is
not
an
automobile
mechanic.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
says
so
if
the
language
is
but
specifically
says
on
misrepresentation
and
it's
limited
only
by
otherwise
admissible
so
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
that
would
be
our
position
because
we
saw
clearly
that's
what
this
case
is.
and
it's
the
only
thing.
the
only
reason
in
this
case,
we
insisted
that
these
people
are
deported.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
all
of
the
other
questions,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
every
one
that
we
were
able
to
think
of,
the
attorney
general
can
waive
most
of
the
other
provisions
where
you.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
statute
says
on
the
ground
that
and
otherwise
admissible
as
it
only
two
features
that
we
think
of
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
on
page
--
the
statute
is
on
page
4.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
comment
the
government
that
far.
i
just
don't
know.
under
this
statute
i
would
say
that
it
goes
to
any
otherwise
admissible.
it
goes
to
any
ground
you
would
have
to
show
you're
admissible
but
my
real
trouble
mr.
justice
fortas
i
can't
think
of
these
different
examples
that
i
wouldn't
want
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
at
all
mr.
justice
fortas
and
one
that
brought
these
statutes
about
was
whether
people
lied
about
the
country
they
came
from.
that's
what
was
brought
the
statute
on.
and
in
the
earlier
statutes
they
said
specifically
that
this
shall
not
apply
to
the
quota
provisions
and
they
lasted
out
of
this
one
but
this
is
a
statute
which
is
giving
relief
and
i
think
congress
has
a
right
to
limit
the
terms
upon
which
it
would
give
its
relief
in
immigration
matters.
i
think
congress
has
the
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
being
practically
automatic
once
you
show
that
you
made
them
a
statement
and
you
show
your
familial
ties,
that's
it.
and
you
don't
have
to
show
the
quantitative.
you
show
the
quantitative
you
only
show
quality
and
judge
duniway
in
a
concurring
opinion
attempted
to
limit
it
that
this
was
a
word
of
ought,
words
of
ought
rather
the
otherwise
admissible
but
in
the
broad
language
of
the
opinion
it
seems
to
me
that
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
(1)
you
have
made
them
a
statement
and
(2)
you
have
the
basic
ties
or
family
ties
and
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
judge
duniway
did.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are
specific,
tuberculosis
is
one
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
was
the
one
you
were
thinking
about.
yes
and
many
others.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
i
think
the
language
is
what
we
are
worried
about
the
ninth
circuit
language
is
so
broad.
on
the
--
getting
back
to
the
point,
you
bear
in
mind
that
this
section
241
(f)
which
is
on
page
4
as
i
remember
and
i
have
to
once
more
say
that
it's
on
the
ground
that
the
alien
was
excludable
at
the
time
of
his
entry
and
it
appear,
it
would
appear
that
it
was
for
procured
documents
of
forgery
and
what
have
you
and
then
it
says
otherwise
admissible
and
that's
our
whole
case
and
judge
duniway
as
i
mentioned
felt
that
it
was
otherwise
admissible
was
a
term
of
our
attorney
referring
only
to
qualitative
grounds
and
not
to
quantitative
and
that's
his
whole
basis
and
i
view
his
opinion
as
an
effort
to
so
limit
the
two
judges
opinion
so
that
it
would
stand
up
but
we
say
that
falls
too
and
judge
duniway
we
point
out,
beginning
on
page
26
that
the
only
basis
for
his
assertion
is
section
211
(a)
which
we
have
set
out
in
our
appendix
and
he
assumes
that
since
211
(a)
used
a
specific
language
about
quota
that
the
fact
that
it
didn't
use
it
in
our
statute
makes
it
clear
that
it
didn't
intend
it.
but
our
reading
of
241
(f)
waives
only
deportability
for
misrepresentation
and
not
any
additional
grounds
because
if
there
are
additional
grounds
you
can
go
through
the
other
sections
of
the
statute.
and
when
we
look
at
241
in
(f)
in
the
overall
statutory
scheme
which
i
like
to
do
for
a
change,
you
remember
that
way
back
prior
to
48,
they
had
put
in
provisions,
there
was
no
provision
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
if
there
was
a
misrepresentation,
the
only
means
of
deportability
was
the
courts
would
determine
that
you
didn't
have
a
visa
and
you
only
because
you
lied
to
get
a
visa.
and
then
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948
said
that
anybody
who
lies
shall
forever
be
barred
from
admission
and
then
in
1952
and
1957
and
eventually
the
one
that
we
get
up
here
1251
it
would
show
that
throughout
this,
congress
has
never
meant
to
throw
out
the
quota
system
and
we
spelled
that
out
in
our
brief
and
we
stand
on
that
particular
point
as
stated.
every
other
way
provision
in
the
immigration
act
is
hinged
with
applying
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
proving
that
you
are
entitled
to
get
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
a
discretion.
and
i
don't
believe
we
can
assume
the
congress
in
this
one
intended
to
give
absolute
authority
on
misrepresentations
that
normally
would
have
had
to
go
through
the
other
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
over
the
quota?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
within
each
party,
you
mean
the
quota.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
yes,
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
he
could,
that
he
could
not
fit
in
there
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that's
our
position.
i
think
that's
what
the
statute
clearly
means.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wouldn't
--
i
would
assume
he
wouldn't
have.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
wait
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
when
the
statute
means
otherwise
admissible
it
means
that
once
you
have
the
misrepresentation
you
have
made
created
your
preference
status,
you
obviously
are
not
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
fortas
my
point
is
all
you
can
waive
is
the
fact
that
he
lied,
lied
period.
but
you
can't
waive
the
fact
that
in
reality
he
wasn't
admissible
as
a
mechanic.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
--
the
way
we
try
to
spell
it
out
in
the
brief
if
i
could
but
that's
--
it's
just
--
if
waiving
the
lie
can
be
done,
but
waiving
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
waive
the
fact,
the
fact
is
that
he
was
not
a
qualified
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
glad
you
didn't
use
the
word
material,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
really
would
have
trouble
me.
chief
justice,
i
can
save
a
little
of
my
time.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
this
mr.
justice
brennan
on
qualitative
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
quantitatively
we
have
covered
those
points
and
started
on
page
26
of
our
brief.
qualitatively
i'm
along
with
you
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
say
that
that
cannot
stand
in
the
whole
theory
of
immigration.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
how
i
understand
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
don't
agree
with
but
you
don't
think
would
excuse
lying
about
these
other
things?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
some
of
it.
not
all
of
it
but
some
of
it.
it
did
have
to
be
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
used
--
i
have
about
three
more
minutes
if
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
was
just
pointing
out
the
very
touching
and
i
agree
with
the
situation
of
this
family
in
the
errico
case
and
it's
a
type
of
case
that
should
get
discretionary
relief
but
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
limited
to
a
family
of
that
size.
it
would
apply
to
a
woman
who
arrived
in
here
into
the
united
states
and
had
a
baby
one
month
after
she
arrived
and
having
told
the
same
type
of
lie
it
would
be
qualified.
that's
--
i'm
just
–
i
give
great
sympathy
for
the
errico
family
but
after
all
we
have
the
law
and
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
this
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
point
about
the
present
relationship
of
both
of
these
cases
and
if
the
court
would
note
on
our
brief
the
footnote
on
page
5,
none
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
brennan
petition
for
certiorari,
in
errico.
but
the
substance
of
it
is
that
it
is
not
limited
to
these
cases
because
under
the
act
which
will
become
effective
july
1
of
1968,
the
legislation
provides
a
worldwide
quota
that
still
be
an
annual
quota
but
it
will
be
a
worldwide
one
of
170,000
and
a
system
of
preferences
and
it
appears
that
it
also
includes
a
limitation
of
20,000
immigrants
from
anyone
country
per
year
so
we
still
have
the
problem
regardless
of
the
removal
of
the
existing
quotas.
there,
it's
really
expected
there's
of
course
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
there
is
one
additional
fact
which
we
have
in
our
brief
on
page
3
on
the
question
of
family
ties
that
we
have
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
of
our
brief
in
the
scott
case
the
brief
on
the
merits.
on
page
3
it's
pointed
out
that
her
sister
is
also
up
for
deportation
and
the
--
it's
being
of
course
judicial
review
has
been
sought
in
this
court
of
appeals
and
it's
apparent
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
waiting
for
this
on.
the
--
i
come
again
to
the
background
of
this
section
241
(f).
and
i
noticed
that
counsel
is
using
the
same
language
as
the
ninth
circuit
about
this
automatic
provision.
and
as
i
understand,
what's
being
argued
here
today
is
that
if
somebody
has
misrepresented
a
fact
and
they
have
anybody
within
the
language
of
the
statute
they
automatically
remain
here
and
i
would
assume
that
all
you
do
in
the
case
like
that
is
file
a
marriage
certificate
or
birth
certificate
and
that's
it.
we've
been
invited
to
go
through
the
legislative
history.
i
briefly
went
over
but
i
think
we
can
do
a
little
examining.
the
1948
act
said
in
so
many
words
that
any
person
who
willfully
makes
a
misrepresentation
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
an
admission
shall
thereafter
be
not
admissible
into
the
united
states,
ever.
that
was
of
course
harsh
language.
as
i
pointed
out
this
morning
prior
to
that
there
was
no
grounds
for
mistakes
and
then
in
1952
we
had
the
softening
of
it
that
it
continued
on
through
but
each
one
of
the
act
as
set
out
in
our
brief
from
the
48
act
up
to
the
last
one,
there
was
no
question
they
were
lessening
the
rules.
in
the
act
we
now
have
in
question
was
the
effort
to
remove
the
complete
harshness
of
the
48
bill
as
it
was
amended
down
the
line.
it
was
a
harsh
bill
and
i
assume
that
that
was
the
reason
that
it
would
appear
to
just
the
reading
of
the
statute
without
the
legislative
history
to
assume
that
it
was
to
be
automatic.
the
statement
has
also
been
made
that
the
phrase
otherwise
admissible
is
something
new.
it's
in
section
241
(f),
section
211
(b),
section
211
(a),
212
(b),
(e),
(g),
(h),
(i)
and
etcetera.
it's
also
on
the
statute.
i
mean
it's
--
it's
not
a
new
language
and
it
means
the
same
thing
it
meant
in
the
immigration
law
all
along.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
a
single
statute
where
it
deliberately
eliminates
the
quota
system.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
history,
the
legislative
history
always
gets
some
one
or
two
senator
or
one
or
two
congressmen
that
always
say
we're
not
going
to
touch
the
quotas.
they
keep
saying
it
over
and
over
again
up
until
the
last
act.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
in
the
general
discussion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
general
discussion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
act
also,
the
real
section
relied
on
the
act
restricts
the
quota
deliberately
and
i
think
you
have
to
take
the
two
together.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
on
the
past
or
in
the
future?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
past,
i
think
it's
on
an
annual
basis.
when
it's
used
up,
you
start
over
again,
you
start
over
again
on
a
new
one.
there's
never
been
any
question
of
most
of
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
first
come,
first
served
in
the
bracket
of
preference
that
you're
in.
they
run
in
size
five
preference
practice.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
for
that
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
your
number
might
come
up?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
does
it
go
for
one
year?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you're
listed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
if
there
was
a
less
--
if
there
was
a
less
of
1200
and
you
lied
and
come
here
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no.
actually
that's
the
argument
that's
made
here.
that
he
stays
right
here
forever.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
don't
think
the
number
matters
too
much.
if
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
so
far
as
we
know
he
didn't
have
any
number.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
in
here
she
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
in
both
cases,
the
applicant
lied.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
first
one
would
not
have
been
--
i
would
not
consider
that
the
person
who
was
on
the
list
is
eligible
to
be
admitted.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he's
not
eligible
until
his
number
comes
up.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
long
as
--
no
sir,
as
long
as
the
quota
is
there
i
am
not
defending
the
quota.
the
quota
is
there,
that's
all.
and
the
quota
says
that
this
many
people
can
come
from
jamaica
or
italy
to
be
the
case
you
want
and
that's
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
no
sir.
no
sir
because
you
are
waiting
in
a
group.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
but
it
does.
i
guess
that
some
could
get
on
those
that
have
some
criminal
records
and
things
like
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
criminal
records
and
stuff
like
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they're
not
eligible
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
that's
right,
at
some
time.
but
when
you
come
in
illegally,
you
have
taken
the
position
of
somebody
who
was
validly
ready
to
come
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
could
have
gotten
in
next
year
he
would
have
waited
for
that
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
see
that's
a
discretionary
point
more
than
i
believe
it
wouldn't.
but
i
don't
think
it's
automatic.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
general
law
of
immigration
ever
since
we
had
immigration
law?
before
there
was
no
chance
of
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
believe
that
section
7
said
that
somebody
who
comes
into
this
country
after
misrepresenting
themselves
and
the
mere
fact
that
by
the
own
action
of
the
person
involved
she
has
a
child,
she
should
be
in
a
better
position
than
everybody
else?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
congress
could
have
said
so
and
congress
did
not.
congress
said
otherwise
admissible.
and
just
being
on
a
list
does
not
make
you
admissible.
what
we
mean
by
admissible
is
that
you
are
ready
to
get
your
visa.
you
are
not
admissible
without
a
visa.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
in
the
last
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
in
the
last
case
the
only
thing
was
that
you
could
forget
the
fact
that
he
told
a
lie.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
i
am
sure
of
it.
he
could've
come
in
and
if
he's
in
a
quota.
if
his
number
had
come
up
or
if
he
was
a
qualified
automobile
mechanic
either
one
he
could
have
gotten
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
it
helps.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
it
helps
him
at
all.
i
think
these
are
several
other
sections
that
could
possibly
help
him
and
there
are
several
other
sections
that
could
possibly
help.
and
ms.
scott
is
a
much
better
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sure.
if
he
come
in
south
america
because
there
is
no
quota
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
it
still
has--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
said
in
the
debates
that
it
was
for
the
mexicans
and
other
continental
countries.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
as
to
the
tubercular,
there
is
a
specific
section
on
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
would
say
that
that's
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
clear
up
this
morning
that
where
you
have
a
specific
section
that
gives
relief,
i
don't
believe
this
section
was
meant
to
cover
that
specific
point
and
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
getting
ready
to
say
and
it
would
be
on
that
basis
that
i
would
say
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
would
say
that
you
don't
qualify
this
because
you
get
relief
onto
the
other
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
my
point
is
yes,
the
statute
would
help
on
the
communist
on
the
other
point
but
i
would
--
there's
no
decision
on
it
that
i
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
my
position
on
the
communist
as
i
understand
it
there
is
no
waiver
on
that
but
that's
strictly
for
the
communist
and
i
am
not
too
sure
about
the
others.
i
mean
we
spelled
it
out
as
best
as
we
could.
yes,
i've
been
reminded
that
the
criminal
record
that
there
is
a
provision
for
waiver.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
a
specific
provision.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
history
of
the
statute
says
that
the
waiver
was
to
cover
the
points
that
started
in
the
48
statute
saying
the
mere
fact
that
you
tell
a
lie
makes
you
forever
ineligible
for
citizenship.
this
as
i
understand
the
statute
it
says
no
longer
can
you
use
that
as
a
sole
basis
for
exclusion
or
for
deportation.
just
the
fact
of
lying
alone
is
not
enough
and
so
the
only
thing,
the
immigration
says
has
got
against
you
is
that
you
have
lied.
they
--
and
you
have
the
family
connection.
they
waived
that,
providing
you're
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
understand
it
to
mean.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
exactly,
yes
sir
and
now
i
footnote
it
by
saying
that
a
lot
of
these
others
have
specific
other
waiver
provisions.
no
sir
we're
not
concerned
with
those,
would
that
qualify
the
statement,
i
would
say
that's
our
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
we
agree
that
she
has
a
necessary
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
that
respect,
but
i
should
point
out
as
i
did
in
errico
that
she
can
apply
even
for
a
suspension
for
deportation
under
section
244.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
and
adjustment
of
status
and
if
she's
actually
deported
there's
no
question
about
it,
it
seems
to
me
about
it
getting
back,
because
she's
got
an
american
citizen
as
a
child.
i
don't
think
there
has
got
to
be
a
problem
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
has
got
an
american
citizen
as
her
child
is
an
american
citizen.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
the
number
will
be
too
difficult
for
jamaican
and
there's
also
the
question
of
immigrants
with
skills
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
–
there's
a
possibility
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
we
don't
know.
i
mean
there's
no
way
for
us
to
know.
well,
i
mean
the
jamaica
is
an
independent
country
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
has
an
independent
country
and
in
this
hemisphere
there
is
no
quota
involved
there.
no
longer.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
quite
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
she
can
apply
for
suspension
and
deportation
right
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
doesn't
do
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
(inaudible)
fast
plane.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
she
still
has
to
have
a
visa
and
she
has
to
qualify.
there
are
a
lot
of
qualifications.
she
has
to
fill
out
the
forms
to
qualify
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
not
a
single
suggestion
that
i
know
of
then
i've
had
this
check
by
immigration
and
they
can
find
that.
there
would
be
no
--
no
quota
restrictions
as
she
applied
now
but
it
wouldn't
be
immediate.
the
usual
red
tape,
i
would
assume,
would
be
involved
but
i
am
interested
in
the
part
that
she
can
apply
a
suspension
of
deportation
and
remain
here
now
and
i
--
i
am
not
at
all
carried
away
by
what
allegedly
happened
in
another
immigration
case.
i
am
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
she
would
have
an
adjustment
of
status
at
the
same
time
she'd
applied
for
just
adjustment
of
status.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
would
not
have
to
leave
but
the
--
in
all
fairness
there
was
an
adjustment
of
status
would
not
be
granted
because
of
the
long
standing
time
of
litigation
but
i
can
--
i
mean
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
i
can't
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sure
she
can
always
voluntarily
deport.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
original
order
gave
him
a
right
to
deport
voluntarily
if
she
wanted
to
but
instead
she
comes
up
on
this
and
we
insist
that
she
should
not
be
penalized
merely
because
she
came
to
the
courts.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
she
named
jamaica.
if
she
had
to
go
back
she
would
go
back
to
jamaica,
but
i
understand
again
from
the
regulations
that
the
old
idea
of
going
to
canada
and
coming
back
of
being
found
on
she
rather
go
back
to
jamaica
and
come
back.
it's
the
matter
of
transportation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
not
these
days.
theres
no
rules.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
said
before,
the
wisdom
of
it
i
--
it's
an
act
of
congress
and
it
was
made
to
get
rid
of
the
statements
that
were
made
under
pressure
or
would
have
you
about
the
country
you
are
from
and
all
then
tell
you
to
go
back
to
it
and
all
of
the
--
as
the
result
of
the
refugees
and
it
was
just
to
get
rid
of
that
that's
what
he
was
for.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
to
open
the
door.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir
we
have
our
time
in
getting
that
many
though.
i
could
see
quite
frankly
and
we
barred
some
from
judge
kaplan's
opinion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
obviously
there
were
some
purpose
in
mind
and
we
try
to
find
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
take
the
fifth
amendment
on
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
part
of
the
british
colony.
it
was
very
small.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
100.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
100
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
sure
always.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
are
68,
but
there's
no
quota
now
–
65
and
no
quota
now.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
the
great
difficulty
in
not
agreeing
in
this
case
and
i
don't
is
because
of
the
present
in
value
for
the
future
as
long
as
we
have
this
overall
quota
for
the
whole
world.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
take
the
answer
is
that
if
the
--
either
one
had
gone
or
one
of
the
roots
have
gotten
adjustment
status
and
what
have
you
there
wouldn't
be
any
litigation
in
the
first
place
but
they
insist
on
race
in
this
point
and
if
this
point
if
it's
allowed
to
stand
then
it's
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
fifth
amendment
again
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
submit.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
two
cases
that
have
been
set
down
one
to
follow
the
other.
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
vacated
the
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
had
affirmed
an
order
of
deportation
issued
against
giuseppe
errico.
errico
had
entered
the
united
states
in
1959
by
fraudulent
representation
made
in
order
to
bypass
the
then
quota
requirements
for
his
native
country
of
italy.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
of
the
second
circuit
in
scott
against
immigration
service
which
is
the
case
to
follow.
the
issue
in
both
cases
is
much
the
same.
it
is
whether
a
relief
provision
of
the
immigration
act
of
1961,
intended
we
think
to
be
a
relatively
narrow
applicability
actually
waives
the
deportation
of
errico.
the
government
contends
that
the
provision
section
241
helps
in
the
immigration
act
does
not
authorize
the
waiver
of
deportation
in
each
of
these
cases.
a
conclusion
we
say
is
supported
by
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
overall
statutory
scheme
of
the
nationality
acts.
as
to
the
facts,
errico
is
now
32,
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy
and
because
at
the
time
he
sought
entry
as
of
the
present
time,
the
italian
quota
was
substantially
oversubscribed.
indeed,
we
point
out
in
the
brief
that
at
the
time
of
his
entry,
the
waiting
list
was
some
162,612
and
he
made
this
false
statement
in
order
to
obtain
entry
into
the
united
states.
he
falsely
represented
that
he
was
a
skilled
mechanic
with
experience
in
repairing
foreign
automobile
and
because
of
that
representation,
he
was
granted
a
first
preference
status
under
the
italian
quota.
and
under
the
then
existing
preference
system
and
those
are
section
203
(a)
and
(1),
he
was
admitted
in
the
united
states
in
october
of
1959
and
he
has
resided
continuously
in
portland,
oregon
since
his
entry.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
recent
provision
of
course
changes
the
whole
quota
system
that's
gone
and
as
of
now
he
could
qualify
to
come
in
but
there's
still
would
be
i
think
it's
20,000
for
italy.
but
as
it
now
stands
we're
applying
the
law
as
it
was
at
the
time
he
came
in
and
at
the
time
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
number,
it's
pretty
hard,
the
best
example,
i
don't
know
how
we
do
it
these
figures
there,
there
are
some
3
million
resident
aliens
in
the
country
as
of
now.
as
to
how
many
of
them
run
to
this,
i
don't
know.
and
--
but
on
the
other
point
if
you're
interested
on
what
would
happen
to
him
if
this
case
stands
and
the
deportation
stands
as
to
the
area
code,
he
has
parents
here
and
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
as
to
whether
they
are
citizens
yet.
and
he
has
brothers
and
sisters
eight
at
least,
at
least
eight
brothers
and
sisters
not
more,
and
as
he
stands
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
preference.
but
while
he's
in
the
united
states,
he
could
ask
for
discretionary
relief
and
he
could
apply
for
adjustment
of
status.
but
that
would
be
under
the
attorney
general
so
it's
not
a
certainty
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
back
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
could.
the
way
i
am
advised
by
the
revenue
service
that
under
245
which
is
8
u.s.
code
1255
he
could
qualify
for
adjustment
of
status
and
the
immigration
quota
for
italy
is
still
pretty
far
back
as
to
this
amount
and
he
would
have
to
qualify
for
some
of
the
preferences
and
that
would
depend
as
to
whether
or
not
his
mother
and
father
are
citizens
or
the
brothers
and
sisters
wouldn't
help
him
too
much
but
we
don't
know
those
facts.
he
would
still
have
to
qualify
under
the
---
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
never
applied
for
it.
and
once
the
deportation
is
ordered
upon
him
then
he
appealed
straight
up.
i
in
the
hearings,
i
don't
see
why
this
was
ever
raised
at
all.
you
might
have
been
but
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
and
they
just
merely
relied
--
errico
relied
on
this
statute
which
is
this
later
statute
which
gives
him
this
absolute
right
to
stay
in
the
country
if
he's
got
a
spouse
or
a
child
who
is
a
citizen.
and
they
relied
on
that
because
you
see
that
does
not
require
the
attorney
general's
waivers
or
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
obviously,
they
didn't
want
to
submit
to
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
that's
the
only
way
i
can
see.
i
am
told
that
even
as
of
now,
that
there
is
a
provision
where
even
if
this
opinion
is
reversed
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
still
is
a
waiver
possibility
but
i
can't
commit
to
attorney
general
as
to
what
he
will
do
and
that
depends
on
the
status
of
his
family
as
of
now
which
we
don't
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
came
here
with
him
and
his
child
was
born
10
months
after
their
arrival,
clearly
an
american
citizen.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he's
otherwise
admissible
no
question
about
that,
he
comes
on
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
both
the
mother
and
father
are
lawfully
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
--
oh
you
mean
as
to
his
existence?
yes.
yes,
sure.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
question
that
he
has
the
familial
ties
efficient
to
qualify
under
that
section.
there's
no
problem
there.
the
only
problem
is
that
one
as
to
what
is
meant
by
the
grounds
for
and
the
whole
argument
between
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
as
to
whether
or
not
that
includes
quota
and
the
word
is
used
over
and
over
again
in
the
ninth
circuit
of
its
automatic
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
we
can
do
that
is
to
go
back
to
the
statute
itself.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
he
must
admit
that
he
could
not
come
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
oversubscribe
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
says
because
otherwise
admissible
providing
you
deliberately
misstate
a
fact.
congress
said
that
you
can
stay
providing
you're
otherwise
admissible
and
otherwise
admissible
does
not
include
the
quota.
that
otherwise
admissible
the
quota,
qualitative
and
quantitative
are
all
the
same,
that's
his
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
we
say
that
congress
couldn't
possible
have
meant
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
have
some
set
out
in
our
brief
in
page
34
and
36
in
our
brief.
we
have
several
possibilities
and
the
--
i
say
quite
frankly
the
only
thing
i'm
sure
of,
it
doesn't
apply
to
cases
of
this
type.
you
notice
down
at
the
bottom
of
34
because
this
particular
act
and
its
immediate
predecessor,
there
were
words
in
the
congress
in
the
reports
and
in
the
debates
that
was
supposed
to
apply
to
mexicans
who
would
come
over
the
line.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
certainly
would
but
we
try
to
explain
it.
we've
got
that
one
here
under
(e).
since
he
was
otherwise
admissible
is
from
misrepresentation
is
waived
by
241
(f).
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
--
i'm
not
sure
but
these
are
possibilities
we
--
we're
not
certain
of
them
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
i
read
the
record,
it
wasn't
contested.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
assume.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
because
but
for
this
misrepresentation,
he
couldn't
have
gotten
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
he
could
have
because
--
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
if
at
the
moment
he
started
across
the
line
somebody
handed
him
a
thousand
dollars,
he
couldn't
come
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
this
man,
you
couldn't
have
handed
him
the
knowledge
of
this
cause.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
the
line
we
are
trying
to
draw
which
is
the
only
line
we
submit
you
can
draw
when
you
look
through.
number
one,
congress
has
never
failed
to
recognize
quotas.
quotas
up
until
recently
had
been
up
a
most
in
any
discussion
of
immigration
legislation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
yes.
sure.
you
see
that
jamaica
was
then
--
wasn't
an
independent
country
when
she
came
in.
it
was
under
great
britain.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
said
her
marital
status
which
gave
her
the
preference
under
the
quota
and
in
this
we
say
that
congress
insists
on
drawing
the
line
on
the
quota
because
if
the
misrepresentation
there's
no
way
for
him
to
be
otherwise
admissible
if
he
is
not
an
automobile
mechanic.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
says
so
if
the
language
is
but
specifically
says
on
misrepresentation
and
it's
limited
only
by
otherwise
admissible
so
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
that
would
be
our
position
because
we
saw
clearly
that's
what
this
case
is.
and
it's
the
only
thing.
the
only
reason
in
this
case,
we
insisted
that
these
people
are
deported.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
all
of
the
other
questions,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
every
one
that
we
were
able
to
think
of,
the
attorney
general
can
waive
most
of
the
other
provisions
where
you.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
statute
says
on
the
ground
that
and
otherwise
admissible
as
it
only
two
features
that
we
think
of
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
on
page
--
the
statute
is
on
page
4.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
comment
the
government
that
far.
i
just
don't
know.
under
this
statute
i
would
say
that
it
goes
to
any
otherwise
admissible.
it
goes
to
any
ground
you
would
have
to
show
you're
admissible
but
my
real
trouble
mr.
justice
fortas
i
can't
think
of
these
different
examples
that
i
wouldn't
want
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
at
all
mr.
justice
fortas
and
one
that
brought
these
statutes
about
was
whether
people
lied
about
the
country
they
came
from.
that's
what
was
brought
the
statute
on.
and
in
the
earlier
statutes
they
said
specifically
that
this
shall
not
apply
to
the
quota
provisions
and
they
lasted
out
of
this
one
but
this
is
a
statute
which
is
giving
relief
and
i
think
congress
has
a
right
to
limit
the
terms
upon
which
it
would
give
its
relief
in
immigration
matters.
i
think
congress
has
the
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
being
practically
automatic
once
you
show
that
you
made
them
a
statement
and
you
show
your
familial
ties,
that's
it.
and
you
don't
have
to
show
the
quantitative.
you
show
the
quantitative
you
only
show
quality
and
judge
duniway
in
a
concurring
opinion
attempted
to
limit
it
that
this
was
a
word
of
ought,
words
of
ought
rather
the
otherwise
admissible
but
in
the
broad
language
of
the
opinion
it
seems
to
me
that
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
(1)
you
have
made
them
a
statement
and
(2)
you
have
the
basic
ties
or
family
ties
and
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
judge
duniway
did.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are
specific,
tuberculosis
is
one
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
was
the
one
you
were
thinking
about.
yes
and
many
others.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
i
think
the
language
is
what
we
are
worried
about
the
ninth
circuit
language
is
so
broad.
on
the
--
getting
back
to
the
point,
you
bear
in
mind
that
this
section
241
(f)
which
is
on
page
4
as
i
remember
and
i
have
to
once
more
say
that
it's
on
the
ground
that
the
alien
was
excludable
at
the
time
of
his
entry
and
it
appear,
it
would
appear
that
it
was
for
procured
documents
of
forgery
and
what
have
you
and
then
it
says
otherwise
admissible
and
that's
our
whole
case
and
judge
duniway
as
i
mentioned
felt
that
it
was
otherwise
admissible
was
a
term
of
our
attorney
referring
only
to
qualitative
grounds
and
not
to
quantitative
and
that's
his
whole
basis
and
i
view
his
opinion
as
an
effort
to
so
limit
the
two
judges
opinion
so
that
it
would
stand
up
but
we
say
that
falls
too
and
judge
duniway
we
point
out,
beginning
on
page
26
that
the
only
basis
for
his
assertion
is
section
211
(a)
which
we
have
set
out
in
our
appendix
and
he
assumes
that
since
211
(a)
used
a
specific
language
about
quota
that
the
fact
that
it
didn't
use
it
in
our
statute
makes
it
clear
that
it
didn't
intend
it.
but
our
reading
of
241
(f)
waives
only
deportability
for
misrepresentation
and
not
any
additional
grounds
because
if
there
are
additional
grounds
you
can
go
through
the
other
sections
of
the
statute.
and
when
we
look
at
241
in
(f)
in
the
overall
statutory
scheme
which
i
like
to
do
for
a
change,
you
remember
that
way
back
prior
to
48,
they
had
put
in
provisions,
there
was
no
provision
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
if
there
was
a
misrepresentation,
the
only
means
of
deportability
was
the
courts
would
determine
that
you
didn't
have
a
visa
and
you
only
because
you
lied
to
get
a
visa.
and
then
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948
said
that
anybody
who
lies
shall
forever
be
barred
from
admission
and
then
in
1952
and
1957
and
eventually
the
one
that
we
get
up
here
1251
it
would
show
that
throughout
this,
congress
has
never
meant
to
throw
out
the
quota
system
and
we
spelled
that
out
in
our
brief
and
we
stand
on
that
particular
point
as
stated.
every
other
way
provision
in
the
immigration
act
is
hinged
with
applying
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
proving
that
you
are
entitled
to
get
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
a
discretion.
and
i
don't
believe
we
can
assume
the
congress
in
this
one
intended
to
give
absolute
authority
on
misrepresentations
that
normally
would
have
had
to
go
through
the
other
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
over
the
quota?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
within
each
party,
you
mean
the
quota.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
yes,
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
he
could,
that
he
could
not
fit
in
there
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that's
our
position.
i
think
that's
what
the
statute
clearly
means.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wouldn't
--
i
would
assume
he
wouldn't
have.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
wait
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
when
the
statute
means
otherwise
admissible
it
means
that
once
you
have
the
misrepresentation
you
have
made
created
your
preference
status,
you
obviously
are
not
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
fortas
my
point
is
all
you
can
waive
is
the
fact
that
he
lied,
lied
period.
but
you
can't
waive
the
fact
that
in
reality
he
wasn't
admissible
as
a
mechanic.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
--
the
way
we
try
to
spell
it
out
in
the
brief
if
i
could
but
that's
--
it's
just
--
if
waiving
the
lie
can
be
done,
but
waiving
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
waive
the
fact,
the
fact
is
that
he
was
not
a
qualified
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
glad
you
didn't
use
the
word
material,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
really
would
have
trouble
me.
chief
justice,
i
can
save
a
little
of
my
time.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
this
mr.
justice
brennan
on
qualitative
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
quantitatively
we
have
covered
those
points
and
started
on
page
26
of
our
brief.
qualitatively
i'm
along
with
you
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
say
that
that
cannot
stand
in
the
whole
theory
of
immigration.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
how
i
understand
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
don't
agree
with
but
you
don't
think
would
excuse
lying
about
these
other
things?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
some
of
it.
not
all
of
it
but
some
of
it.
it
did
have
to
be
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
used
--
i
have
about
three
more
minutes
if
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
was
just
pointing
out
the
very
touching
and
i
agree
with
the
situation
of
this
family
in
the
errico
case
and
it's
a
type
of
case
that
should
get
discretionary
relief
but
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
limited
to
a
family
of
that
size.
it
would
apply
to
a
woman
who
arrived
in
here
into
the
united
states
and
had
a
baby
one
month
after
she
arrived
and
having
told
the
same
type
of
lie
it
would
be
qualified.
that's
--
i'm
just
–
i
give
great
sympathy
for
the
errico
family
but
after
all
we
have
the
law
and
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
this
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
point
about
the
present
relationship
of
both
of
these
cases
and
if
the
court
would
note
on
our
brief
the
footnote
on
page
5,
none
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
brennan
petition
for
certiorari,
in
errico.
but
the
substance
of
it
is
that
it
is
not
limited
to
these
cases
because
under
the
act
which
will
become
effective
july
1
of
1968,
the
legislation
provides
a
worldwide
quota
that
still
be
an
annual
quota
but
it
will
be
a
worldwide
one
of
170,000
and
a
system
of
preferences
and
it
appears
that
it
also
includes
a
limitation
of
20,000
immigrants
from
anyone
country
per
year
so
we
still
have
the
problem
regardless
of
the
removal
of
the
existing
quotas.
there,
it's
really
expected
there's
of
course
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
there
is
one
additional
fact
which
we
have
in
our
brief
on
page
3
on
the
question
of
family
ties
that
we
have
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
of
our
brief
in
the
scott
case
the
brief
on
the
merits.
on
page
3
it's
pointed
out
that
her
sister
is
also
up
for
deportation
and
the
--
it's
being
of
course
judicial
review
has
been
sought
in
this
court
of
appeals
and
it's
apparent
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
waiting
for
this
on.
the
--
i
come
again
to
the
background
of
this
section
241
(f).
and
i
noticed
that
counsel
is
using
the
same
language
as
the
ninth
circuit
about
this
automatic
provision.
and
as
i
understand,
what's
being
argued
here
today
is
that
if
somebody
has
misrepresented
a
fact
and
they
have
anybody
within
the
language
of
the
statute
they
automatically
remain
here
and
i
would
assume
that
all
you
do
in
the
case
like
that
is
file
a
marriage
certificate
or
birth
certificate
and
that's
it.
we've
been
invited
to
go
through
the
legislative
history.
i
briefly
went
over
but
i
think
we
can
do
a
little
examining.
the
1948
act
said
in
so
many
words
that
any
person
who
willfully
makes
a
misrepresentation
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
an
admission
shall
thereafter
be
not
admissible
into
the
united
states,
ever.
that
was
of
course
harsh
language.
as
i
pointed
out
this
morning
prior
to
that
there
was
no
grounds
for
mistakes
and
then
in
1952
we
had
the
softening
of
it
that
it
continued
on
through
but
each
one
of
the
act
as
set
out
in
our
brief
from
the
48
act
up
to
the
last
one,
there
was
no
question
they
were
lessening
the
rules.
in
the
act
we
now
have
in
question
was
the
effort
to
remove
the
complete
harshness
of
the
48
bill
as
it
was
amended
down
the
line.
it
was
a
harsh
bill
and
i
assume
that
that
was
the
reason
that
it
would
appear
to
just
the
reading
of
the
statute
without
the
legislative
history
to
assume
that
it
was
to
be
automatic.
the
statement
has
also
been
made
that
the
phrase
otherwise
admissible
is
something
new.
it's
in
section
241
(f),
section
211
(b),
section
211
(a),
212
(b),
(e),
(g),
(h),
(i)
and
etcetera.
it's
also
on
the
statute.
i
mean
it's
--
it's
not
a
new
language
and
it
means
the
same
thing
it
meant
in
the
immigration
law
all
along.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
a
single
statute
where
it
deliberately
eliminates
the
quota
system.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
history,
the
legislative
history
always
gets
some
one
or
two
senator
or
one
or
two
congressmen
that
always
say
we're
not
going
to
touch
the
quotas.
they
keep
saying
it
over
and
over
again
up
until
the
last
act.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
in
the
general
discussion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
general
discussion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
act
also,
the
real
section
relied
on
the
act
restricts
the
quota
deliberately
and
i
think
you
have
to
take
the
two
together.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
on
the
past
or
in
the
future?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
past,
i
think
it's
on
an
annual
basis.
when
it's
used
up,
you
start
over
again,
you
start
over
again
on
a
new
one.
there's
never
been
any
question
of
most
of
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
first
come,
first
served
in
the
bracket
of
preference
that
you're
in.
they
run
in
size
five
preference
practice.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
for
that
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
your
number
might
come
up?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
does
it
go
for
one
year?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you're
listed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
if
there
was
a
less
--
if
there
was
a
less
of
1200
and
you
lied
and
come
here
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no.
actually
that's
the
argument
that's
made
here.
that
he
stays
right
here
forever.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
don't
think
the
number
matters
too
much.
if
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
so
far
as
we
know
he
didn't
have
any
number.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
in
here
she
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
in
both
cases,
the
applicant
lied.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
first
one
would
not
have
been
--
i
would
not
consider
that
the
person
who
was
on
the
list
is
eligible
to
be
admitted.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he's
not
eligible
until
his
number
comes
up.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
long
as
--
no
sir,
as
long
as
the
quota
is
there
i
am
not
defending
the
quota.
the
quota
is
there,
that's
all.
and
the
quota
says
that
this
many
people
can
come
from
jamaica
or
italy
to
be
the
case
you
want
and
that's
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
no
sir.
no
sir
because
you
are
waiting
in
a
group.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
but
it
does.
i
guess
that
some
could
get
on
those
that
have
some
criminal
records
and
things
like
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
criminal
records
and
stuff
like
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they're
not
eligible
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
that's
right,
at
some
time.
but
when
you
come
in
illegally,
you
have
taken
the
position
of
somebody
who
was
validly
ready
to
come
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
could
have
gotten
in
next
year
he
would
have
waited
for
that
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
see
that's
a
discretionary
point
more
than
i
believe
it
wouldn't.
but
i
don't
think
it's
automatic.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
general
law
of
immigration
ever
since
we
had
immigration
law?
before
there
was
no
chance
of
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
believe
that
section
7
said
that
somebody
who
comes
into
this
country
after
misrepresenting
themselves
and
the
mere
fact
that
by
the
own
action
of
the
person
involved
she
has
a
child,
she
should
be
in
a
better
position
than
everybody
else?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
congress
could
have
said
so
and
congress
did
not.
congress
said
otherwise
admissible.
and
just
being
on
a
list
does
not
make
you
admissible.
what
we
mean
by
admissible
is
that
you
are
ready
to
get
your
visa.
you
are
not
admissible
without
a
visa.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
in
the
last
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
in
the
last
case
the
only
thing
was
that
you
could
forget
the
fact
that
he
told
a
lie.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
i
am
sure
of
it.
he
could've
come
in
and
if
he's
in
a
quota.
if
his
number
had
come
up
or
if
he
was
a
qualified
automobile
mechanic
either
one
he
could
have
gotten
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
it
helps.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
it
helps
him
at
all.
i
think
these
are
several
other
sections
that
could
possibly
help
him
and
there
are
several
other
sections
that
could
possibly
help.
and
ms.
scott
is
a
much
better
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sure.
if
he
come
in
south
america
because
there
is
no
quota
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
it
still
has--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
said
in
the
debates
that
it
was
for
the
mexicans
and
other
continental
countries.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
as
to
the
tubercular,
there
is
a
specific
section
on
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
would
say
that
that's
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
clear
up
this
morning
that
where
you
have
a
specific
section
that
gives
relief,
i
don't
believe
this
section
was
meant
to
cover
that
specific
point
and
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
getting
ready
to
say
and
it
would
be
on
that
basis
that
i
would
say
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
would
say
that
you
don't
qualify
this
because
you
get
relief
onto
the
other
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
my
point
is
yes,
the
statute
would
help
on
the
communist
on
the
other
point
but
i
would
--
there's
no
decision
on
it
that
i
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
my
position
on
the
communist
as
i
understand
it
there
is
no
waiver
on
that
but
that's
strictly
for
the
communist
and
i
am
not
too
sure
about
the
others.
i
mean
we
spelled
it
out
as
best
as
we
could.
yes,
i've
been
reminded
that
the
criminal
record
that
there
is
a
provision
for
waiver.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
a
specific
provision.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
history
of
the
statute
says
that
the
waiver
was
to
cover
the
points
that
started
in
the
48
statute
saying
the
mere
fact
that
you
tell
a
lie
makes
you
forever
ineligible
for
citizenship.
this
as
i
understand
the
statute
it
says
no
longer
can
you
use
that
as
a
sole
basis
for
exclusion
or
for
deportation.
just
the
fact
of
lying
alone
is
not
enough
and
so
the
only
thing,
the
immigration
says
has
got
against
you
is
that
you
have
lied.
they
--
and
you
have
the
family
connection.
they
waived
that,
providing
you're
otherwise
admissible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
understand
it
to
mean.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
exactly,
yes
sir
and
now
i
footnote
it
by
saying
that
a
lot
of
these
others
have
specific
other
waiver
provisions.
no
sir
we're
not
concerned
with
those,
would
that
qualify
the
statement,
i
would
say
that's
our
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
we
agree
that
she
has
a
necessary
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
that
respect,
but
i
should
point
out
as
i
did
in
errico
that
she
can
apply
even
for
a
suspension
for
deportation
under
section
244.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
and
adjustment
of
status
and
if
she's
actually
deported
there's
no
question
about
it,
it
seems
to
me
about
it
getting
back,
because
she's
got
an
american
citizen
as
a
child.
i
don't
think
there
has
got
to
be
a
problem
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
has
got
an
american
citizen
as
her
child
is
an
american
citizen.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
the
number
will
be
too
difficult
for
jamaican
and
there's
also
the
question
of
immigrants
with
skills
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
–
there's
a
possibility
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
we
don't
know.
i
mean
there's
no
way
for
us
to
know.
well,
i
mean
the
jamaica
is
an
independent
country
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
has
an
independent
country
and
in
this
hemisphere
there
is
no
quota
involved
there.
no
longer.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
quite
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
she
can
apply
for
suspension
and
deportation
right
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
doesn't
do
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
(inaudible)
fast
plane.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
she
still
has
to
have
a
visa
and
she
has
to
qualify.
there
are
a
lot
of
qualifications.
she
has
to
fill
out
the
forms
to
qualify
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
not
a
single
suggestion
that
i
know
of
then
i've
had
this
check
by
immigration
and
they
can
find
that.
there
would
be
no
--
no
quota
restrictions
as
she
applied
now
but
it
wouldn't
be
immediate.
the
usual
red
tape,
i
would
assume,
would
be
involved
but
i
am
interested
in
the
part
that
she
can
apply
a
suspension
of
deportation
and
remain
here
now
and
i
--
i
am
not
at
all
carried
away
by
what
allegedly
happened
in
another
immigration
case.
i
am
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
she
would
have
an
adjustment
of
status
at
the
same
time
she'd
applied
for
just
adjustment
of
status.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
she
would
not
have
to
leave
but
the
--
in
all
fairness
there
was
an
adjustment
of
status
would
not
be
granted
because
of
the
long
standing
time
of
litigation
but
i
can
--
i
mean
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
i
can't
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sure
she
can
always
voluntarily
deport.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
original
order
gave
him
a
right
to
deport
voluntarily
if
she
wanted
to
but
instead
she
comes
up
on
this
and
we
insist
that
she
should
not
be
penalized
merely
because
she
came
to
the
courts.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
she
named
jamaica.
if
she
had
to
go
back
she
would
go
back
to
jamaica,
but
i
understand
again
from
the
regulations
that
the
old
idea
of
going
to
canada
and
coming
back
of
being
found
on
she
rather
go
back
to
jamaica
and
come
back.
it's
the
matter
of
transportation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
not
these
days.
theres
no
rules.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
said
before,
the
wisdom
of
it
i
--
it's
an
act
of
congress
and
it
was
made
to
get
rid
of
the
statements
that
were
made
under
pressure
or
would
have
you
about
the
country
you
are
from
and
all
then
tell
you
to
go
back
to
it
and
all
of
the
--
as
the
result
of
the
refugees
and
it
was
just
to
get
rid
of
that
that's
what
he
was
for.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
to
open
the
door.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir
we
have
our
time
in
getting
that
many
though.
i
could
see
quite
frankly
and
we
barred
some
from
judge
kaplan's
opinion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
obviously
there
were
some
purpose
in
mind
and
we
try
to
find
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
take
the
fifth
amendment
on
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
part
of
the
british
colony.
it
was
very
small.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
100.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
100
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
sure
always.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
are
68,
but
there's
no
quota
now
–
65
and
no
quota
now.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
the
great
difficulty
in
not
agreeing
in
this
case
and
i
don't
is
because
of
the
present
in
value
for
the
future
as
long
as
we
have
this
overall
quota
for
the
whole
world.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
take
the
answer
is
that
if
the
--
either
one
had
gone
or
one
of
the
roots
have
gotten
adjustment
status
and
what
have
you
there
wouldn't
be
any
litigation
in
the
first
place
but
they
insist
on
race
in
this
point
and
if
this
point
if
it's
allowed
to
stand
then
it's
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
fifth
amendment
again
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
submit.
