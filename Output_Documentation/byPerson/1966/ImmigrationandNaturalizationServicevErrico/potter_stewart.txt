stewart
and
he
has
also
had
a
son
of
at
least
to
the
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents.
justice
potter
stewart
so
he'd
come
under
that
way
too
even
if
there
were
no
child.
justice
potter
stewart
he'd
come
out
of
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
even
--
i
don't
know
but
i
would
think
even
the
ninth
circuit
would
give
this
otherwise
admissible
summary,
in
other
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
i
am
not
mistaken
--
justice
potter
stewart
somebody
with
a
certain
kind
of
disease
is
simply
not
admissible.
and
i
suppose
that
if
it
turned
out
that
this
person
had
that
kind
of
disease
that
he
would
simply
be
not
otherwise
admissible
and
even
in
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
he
could
be
--
he
could
come
out
of
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
justice
potter
stewart
what's
an
example
of
one
of
the
so-called
qualitative
disqualifications
that
you
say
because
that
wouldn't
be
forgiven
on?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
but
what's
an
example
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
the
way
you
got
into
this
country
was
lying
about
his
former
political
beliefs
or
his
political
beliefs,
he
got
in
that
way
and
then
he
had
a
child
in
this
country
and
then
they
moved
to
deport
him
because
of
the
misrepresentation,
wouldn't
the
statute
affect
him?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now
this
would
--
this
would
cover
aliens
like
the
one
in
the
last
case.
and
that
would
be
the
usual
case
and
that
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
the
kind
of
case
that
this
legislative
history,
these
remarks
in
the
congress
seemed
to
be
addressed
to,
aliens
who
already
have
family
in
the
united
states.
this
woman
at
the
time
she
made
a
misrepresentation
wasn't
--
couldn't
possibly
have
been
qualified
under
this
statute
because
she
had
no
family
in
the
united
states,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
reason
now
that
she's
qualified
under
the
literal
--
under
the
words
of
the
statute
so
far
as
familial
connections
though
is
that
she
had
illegitimate
child
after
she
got
her.
justice
potter
stewart
and
after
she
got
here
fraudulently.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
also
had
a
son
of
at

the
aliens

admitted

justice
