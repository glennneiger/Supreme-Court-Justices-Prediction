mr.
william
h.
schroder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
suppose
it
will
accomplish
too
much
of
the
stage
of
the
argument
for
me
to
stand
too
much
time
on
doctrine
of
new
york
times
and
whether
or
not
our
client,
mr.
butts,
is
a
public
official
within
that
definition
nor
whether
or
not
the
matter
that
was
--
the
subject
of
this
magazine
story
was
a
newsworthy
event.
but
before
getting
along
to
that
portion
of
new
york
times
which
if
it
does
apply
to
the
first
two
issues
that
is
public
official
and
newsworthy
event.
clearly
the
way
this
case
or
this
story
was
worked
up
and
was
investigated
and
published,
clearly
beyond
in
a
scintilla
the
question
of
a
doubt
it
would
produce
amount
to
actual
malice,
i
want
to
say
first
that
i
do
not
concede.
certainly,
mr.
butts
is
not
a
public
official
within
new
york
times
as
new
york
times
has
written
at
that
time.
now
there
had
been
decisions
written
since
then
garrison,
rosenblatt
and
of
course,
as
this
court
stated,
time
against
hill
does
not
a
libel
case
and
is
not
to
be
considered
by
the
bar
as
a
libel
case.
so
maybe
the
definition
of
public
official
has
been
somewhat
relaxed
since
the
decision
by
this
court
in
new
york
times.
but
i
would
remind
the
court
that
the
arguments
made
by
my
distinguished
opponent
that
mr.
butts
was
working
for
a
state
university
as
an
athletic
director,
to
me
it
would
make
no
more
difference
than
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
athletic
director
and
the
head
football
coach
at
the
university
of
notre
dame
or
at
yale
university
or
at
harvard
because
they
are
not
tax
supported
of
institution.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
mr.
justice
clark,
if
he
has
been
successful
as
a
coach
and
he's
recognized
as
such
and
gets
a
fine
reputation,
i
say
that
he
is
a
public
figure
because
i
don't
see
how
i
can
deny
him
to
be
a
public
figure
in
candor
whatever
a
public
figure
might
be.
i'll
say
he
is
someone
whose
name
appears
in
the
paper
often.
now
if
that
makes
him
a
public
figure
certainly,
i
candidly
and
fairly
state
that
he
would
be.
but
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
yes,
sir.
he
would
have
been
a
public
man.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
that
would
give
the
news
but,
i
mean
the
magazine
a
privilege
to
comment
upon
his
activities
or
his
own
conduct.
now,
on
this
question
of
public
man
or
public
figure,
one
whose
name
appears
in
the
paper
everyday
is
going
to
be
quite
a
problem
somewhere
along
the
line
for
the
courts
to
delineate
what
is
or
who
is
and
who
is
not
a
public
figure.
for
example
in
atlanta,
we
have
a
community
chess
drive
every
year
and
the
head
of
that
community
chess
drive
name
is
in
the
paper,
pictures
in
the
paper
everyday.
does
he
thereby
become
a
public
figure
in
fair
game
for
comment
on
the
times?
now,
let
me,
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
the
head
of
the
community
chess
drive
would
be
a
public
man
but
i
think
if
the
court
extends
its
definition
of
public
official
and
to
the
public
man
or
the
public
figure
domain
then
i
think
you
get
pretty
close
to
it
anybody
whose
name
in
the
paper,
featured
in
the
paper
more
than
twice.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
correct,
correct.
no
official
connection.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
yes,
he
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
so
i'm
not
going
to
belabor
that
public
official
argument.
i
don't
want
to
be
considered
as
having
waived
it
by
in
our
argument
any
further
but
i
have
a
point
made
in
the
brief
and
we
would
like
to
have
it
considered.
but
going
down,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
the
story
itself
and
that
after
all
is
that
what
i
consider
to
be
what
we
have
a
trying
here
today
really
aside
from
technicalities.
we
assume
new
york
times
applies.
we
have
a
limitation,
which
was
even
recognized
and
followed
in
the
non-libel
case
or
the
invasion
of
the
right
of
privacy
case
being
the
hill
case.
and,
of
course,
that
if
the
publication
is
false
and
if
it
is
published
with
reckless
disregard
of
its
falsity,
then
under
garrison
and
then
on
the
time
against
hill,
it
is
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
does
this
case
--
to
the
facts
of
this
case
term
within
that
language?
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
highly
important
to
look
at
this
publication
and
what
curtis
publishing
company
actually
had
to
say
about
the
respondent.
this
was
not
a
report
of
maybe
in
some
nebulous
claim
as
to
how
he
was
handling
funds
as
the
key
director
or
as
to
whether
or
not
the
convicts
were
brutal
with
his
family
when
they
were
there.
this
is
most
serious
indictment
that
could
ever
in
my
mind
be
made
or
belittle
of
colored
student
and
i
think
it's
in
--
it's
a
test
to
petition
for
certiorari.
the
editorial
itself
which
i
will
read
and
then
pass
along,
this
sets
the
stage
not
since
the
chicago
white
sox
through
the
1919
world
series
has
there
been
a
sports
story
as
shocking
as
this
one.
this
is
a
story
of
one
fixed
game
of
college
football.
before
they
reversed
the
georgia
played
the
university
of
alabama
last
september
1922,
wally
butts,
athletic
director
of
georgia,
gave
paul
‘bear'
bryant,
head
coach
of
alabama,
georgia's
place,
defense
patterns,
all
these
significant
secrets
which
georgia's
football
team
possessed.
the
corrupt
here
were
not
professional
ball
players
known
wrong
as
in
the
1919
black
sox
scandal.
the
corrupt
were
disreputable
gamblers
as
in
the
scandals
continually
affecting
college
basketball.
the
corrupt
were
two
men,
butts
and
bryant,
employed
to
educate
and
to
guide
young
men.
how
prevalent
is
the
fixing
of
college
football
games?
how
often
do
teachers
sell
out
their
pupils?
we
don't
know,
yet
for
now
we
can
only
be
uphold.
in
the
body
of
the
article
which
is
a
test
with
the
petitioner
and
particularly
on
the
last
page,
the
editors
recognized
and
i
read
the
last
paragraph,
“the
chances
are
that
wally
butts
will
never
help
any
football
team
again”.
bear
bryant
may
well
fall
a
hand
into
oblivion.
a
special
hale
for
that
gram
extra
word
for
in
the
variant
real
sense,
he
betrayed
the
boys
he
was
pledged
to
lead
so
i
say,
careers
will
be
ruined.
that
i
saw
i
say,
that
story
was
published
about
a
post
with
full
knowledge
of
what
effect
it
would
have
upon
the
respondent
and
the
respondent
is
the
only
one
with
whom
i
have
this
minimum
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
the
evidence
for
the
--
about
the
plaintiff,
i
mean
the
one
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
like
going
to
the
plaintiff.
the
defendant
consisted
of
a
man
who
wrote
the
notes,
the
man
by
the
name
of
burnett,
it
consisted
of
the
head
football
coach
of
the
university
of
georgia,
who
testified
in
effect
that
the
only
thing
out
of
all
those
pockets
of
notes
that
we
have
here
that
he
saw
that
would
indicate
anything
to
anybody
where
the
two
formations
known
in
football
as
a
pro
set
and
slugged
formation.
each
of
which,
georgia
had
used
the
year
before
so
there
wasn't
any
secret
about
it.
in
support
of
truth,
that's
all
he
said.
and
actually
put
off
with
a
couple
of
assistant
coach
just
who
said
“no
more”
and
then
they
rested.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
there
was
evidence
from
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
--
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
i
heard
the
question.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
there
were
telephone
records
showing
that
there
was
a
telephone
call
between
the
two
partners
on
the
date
not
the
one
mentioned
in
the
magazine
or
they
put
it
on
either
one
day
or
before,
and
that
there
was
another
one
on
the
16th
of
september
between
these
two
parties.
the
same
telephone
records
showed
that
the
parties
have
talked
back
and
forth
with
each
other,
almost
daily.
certainly
every
week,
that
coach
bryant
for
example,
talked
to
every
coach
in
southwest
including
coach
del
rona,
its
all
in
this
in
record.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
yes.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
there
was.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
the
record
will
support
me
when
i
say
that
neither
party
had
any
independent
recollection
of
any
particular
telephone
conversation
that
they
had.
they
did
know
they
talked
often.
they
talked
about
matters
of
equal
interest
to
both
of
them
involving
rules
infractions
and
protecting
ball
players
from
getting
hurt.
they
talked
all
the
time.
that
seems
to
be
the
football
coach
is
hobby
as
to
call
up
one
of
his
competitors
and
discuss
business
with
him.
not
what
has
been
accused
of
hill.
but
where
this
thing
started
was
mr.
beddow,
whose
name
has
been
referred
to
here
earlier,
who
was
opposed
birmingham
attorney,
set
word
to
mr.
strubing
that
burnett,
the
man
in
atlanta
had
a
story
worth
looking
into
because
it
involved
bear
bryant,
who
was
suing
them
in
birmingham.
they
said
that
burnett
had
intercepted
a
telephone
conversation
five
months
previously
between
coach
butts
and
coach
bryant.
that
mr.
burnett's
friend,
john
carmichael,
was
with
them
at
the
time
this
conversation
was
going
on
and
discussed
it
with
him
after
it
was
concluded.
curtis
hired
a
freelance
sports
writer
by
the
name
of
frank
graham,
who
had
never
written
a
major
football
story
before,
to
go
to
atlanta
and
interview
burnett.
they
told
graham
before
he
went,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
record,
page
722,
“if
the
story
seems
to
be
working
out”,
whatever
that
means,
“not
to
worry
about
money.
money
was
no
other.”
graham
went
to
atlanta
and
he
interviewed
burnett.
but
he
didn't
interview
carmichael,
whom
he
knew
had
been
pressed.
graham
was
told
by
burnett
that
he
had
made
these
notes
of
what
was
said
but
they
didn't
have
possession
of
them
at
the
time
he
was
being
interviewed
by
graham
and
therefore
his
recollection
of
what
was
said
was
vague.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
i
don't
know
where
he
said
there
might
be
but
i
do
--
i
know
where
they
were.
it
would
be
out
of
the
record
maybe
if
i
said
so
but
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
--
they
didn't
ask
for
them.
they
were
available.
they
could
have
been
gotten.
said,
it
were
--
memory
was
sort
of
vague
because
the
conversation
had
taken
place
five
months
ago
and
it
didn't
have
his
notes.
anyway,
graham
said
in
effect,
give
me
an
affidavit
about
what
you
remember
anyway
and
i'll
pay
you
$2,000
for
your
affidavit.
and
i'm
going
to
take
you
back
to
new
york
and
i'll
submit
it
to
my
employers
up
there
and
if
they
think
its
good
enough,
strong
enough,
we'll
pay
you
$3,000
more
if
we
have
the
exclusive.
this
coupled
with
graham
and
the
post
knowledge
that
burnett
had
a
criminal
record
for
bad
check
rate.
it's
so
important
that
the
--
that
to
ensure
accuracy
i
will
quote
from
graham's
testimony
itself
taken
by
us
in
new
york
on
a
discovery
deposition.
since
the
affidavit
formed
the
real
core
of
the
story,
except
from
some
quotations
from
various
people,
most
of
which
quotations
was
subsequently
denied
under
oath
at
the
trial.
the
record
at
page
39,
question:
“other
than
what
is
set
forth
in
this
affidavit?”
now,
i'm
examining
mr.
graham
in
new
york,
he
has
this
affidavit.
but
he
has
secured
from
graham
in
atlanta.
“other
than
what
is
set
forth
in
this
affidavit,
there
was
no
discussion
as
to
the
substance
of
the
conversation
between
butts
and
bryant?”
answer
he
says,
“no.
just
that
he
was
he
couldn't
remember
anything
definite
about
it.”
this
is
quote.
he
said
“without
his
notes”.
so,
i
say
when
i
return
into
the
article
in
the
magazine
about
halfway
down
the
first
column.
there
is
a
paragraph
which
reads,
“butts
outlined
georgia's
offensive
plays
for
bryant
and
told
them
how
georgia
planned
to
defend
against
alabama
at
that
time.
now,
did
burnett
furnish
you
within
a
detail
as
to
what
offense
of
players
was
discussed?”
answer,
“no.
he
just
said
that
there
was
talked
about
this
in
which
butts
mentioned
specific
time
but
he
could
not
recall.”
now,
the
peculiar
thing
here
is
that
the
post
editors
and
an
editorial
accompanying
the
article
called
it
what
i
have
just
read
to
the
court.
that
was
an
interpretation,
had
to
be
an
interpretation
of
these
notes
or
what
was
said
that
was
recollected
by
months
earlier
because
there's
only
one
party
involved
and
that
is
the
man
who
is
listening
in.
so,
the
only
source
for
this
inter
--
for
the
statement
of
story
could
be
number
one,
an
interpretation
of
burnett's
notes
by
someone
knowledgeable
in
football
language.
but
it
didn't
have
that
because
the
post
never
got
the
notes
before
publishing
the
story.
the
only
other
alternative
for
an
interpretation
would
be
that
by
burnett
of
what
he
heard
five
months
previously
given
without
the
aid
of
his
notes.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
on
the
very
date
of
the
intercepted
telephone
conversation
burnett,
while
everything
was
clear
on
his
mind
as
to
what
he
had
heard
and
with
his
notes
before
him,
told
john
carmichael
what
he
had
heard
and
how
he
had
interpreted
what
he
had
heard
that
burnett
whatever.
and
he
told
carmichael
at
that
time
and
he
so
testified
at
the
trial.
that
that
soon
after
the
conversation,
we
couldn't
even
decide
which
team
to
bet
on
because
we
didn't
know
based
on
what
i
heard
who
the
favorite
was
or
who
the
favorite
should
be?
so
we
have
burnett
interpreting
the
same
conversations
twice,
right
after
they
were
over
and
again
five
months
later,
when
he
didn't
have
his
notes
and
when
the
post
was
willing
to
pay
him
$5,000
for
it.
no
wonder,
the
post
didn't
insist
on
seeing
the
notes
before
the
publication
and
they
didn't.
no
wonder
they
didn't
want
to
interview
carmichael
because
his
interpretation
might
differ
from
what
this
fellow
put
in
his
affidavit.
no
wonder
they
made
no
further
check
into
burnett's
past,
his
history.
they
had
what
they
had
come
to
buy
and
they
never
even
contacted
burnett.
now,
if
it
please
the
court
between
the
time
they
bought
that
affidavit
and
before
they
published
it.
i
represent
wally
butts,
sent
the
post
or
telegram
which
reads
in
part,
i'm
reading
from
the
record
777.
as
coach
butt's
attorney,
“i
am
informing
you
here
and
now”.
this
has
gotten
around
what
was
the
affidavit
having
been
sold.
although
not
many
people
knew
exactly
what
was
in
it
but
they
had
the
idea.
as
coach
butt's
attorney,
“i'm
informing
you
here
and
now
of
the
falsity
of
the
charges
contained
in
the
proposed
article
and
to
respectfully
request
that
you
and
the

letter
follows,
that
was
march
11th.
the
date
of
the
magazine
was
march
23rd.
on
the
same
date,
i
set
on
and
wrote
a
registered
mail
letter.
in
the
depositions,
the
editor
of
post,
this
is
in
with
the
record,
mr.
blair
acknowledged
that
he
received
them.
he
ignored
them.
he
didn't
even
acknowledged
receipt
of
them
to
me
at
that
time
and
proceeded
to
publish
the
story
as
it
has
been
written
without
making
any
changes
and
more
important
than
anything,
without
making
any
additional
investigation.
the
reason
i
sent
the
telegram,
i
wrote
the
letter.
certain,
it
was
not
laying
the
basis
for
a
libel
suit
because
i
was
sincerely
hopeful
that
no
publication
whatever
be
forth
coming.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
this
would
only
be
happening
in
a
very
few
case
because
you
hardly
ever
know
what
someone
had
known
to
publish
about
you
until
it's
already
published.
but
i
had
a
rumor
that
came
to
me
that
this
was
in
the
mails
and
the
record
was
shown
here
that
this
man
burnett
and
his
cohorts
had
tried
to
pedal
the
story
before
the
post
ever
bought
it.
the
record
shows
that
they
tried
to
pedal
it
to
a
radio
announcer
in
new
york
named
phil
rizzuto
and
that's
in
the
record
and
he
refused
to
touch
it.
the
word
got
to
me
that
the
post
had
bought
it.
and
i
certainly
felt,
that
the
post
being
a
responsible
member
of
the
press.
i
felt
competent
that
before
publishing
the
story
they
knew
and
so
stated
that
would
ruin
a
man's
career
and
forever
make
him,
his
children
and
his
grandchildren
bearing
his
name,
objects
of
public
hatred,
contempt,
and
ridicule.
they
would
either
kill
the
story.
the
courts
had
investigated
my
background
and
the
community
i
think
that
would
have
come
up
a
little
bit
better
than
the
man
who
had
given
the
affidavit.
either
kill
it
or
look
further
into
it.
get
in
touch
with
me
and
say,
“what
do
you
have
to
back
off
what
you
say?”
here's
what
they
could
have
done.
they
could
have
gotten
the
notes.
they
wouldn't
be
withheld
from
it.
they
could
have
submitted
them
to
an
expert
in
football,
who
would
have
told
them
as
the
experts
said
at
the
trial,
“there's
nothing
in
here
that
could
possibly
constitute
a
fixed,
a
rigged,
a
sell
out
as
the
post
has
charge.”
they
could
have
asked
for
the
film
of
the
game.
it
was
available.
the
jury
looked
at
it.
the
film
shows
exactly
what
happened
on
each
play.
to
be
brief,
the
first
three
touch
downs
scored
by
alabama
as
low
as
38
to
9.
first
three
touch
downs
was
scored
purely
as
a
result,
georgia
had
lost
to
the
sophomores,
failures
on
the
part
of
the
players
and
the
coaches
admittedly.
for
example,
i
had
offensive
halfback,
planned
defensive
halfback
for
georgia
and
the
in
run
by
him
and
joe
namath,
now
with
just
were
in
the
touchdown
phase.
the
second
touch
down
scored
when
the
georgia's
in,
got
a
position
as
first
varsity
game.
certainly,
there
was
nothing
in
those
films
that
would
suggest
a
sell
out.
that's
second
thing.
number
three,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
alabama
players
and
asked
them
whether
there
had
been
any
last
minute
changes
in
the
coaching
techniques
given
them
by
coach
bryant
and
they
would
have
found
that
there
weren't.
next,
they
could
have
call
--
they
could
have
interviewed
carmichael.
carmichael
would
have
put
an
entirely
different
slang
on
this
banded
burnett.
and
at
the
trial,
carmichael
even
testified
that
the
notes
that
burnett
brought
to
the
trial
with
him
were
not
the
same
ones
that
he
had
after
the
telephone
conversation.
and
the
post
could
have
found
that
out
just
by
interviewing
him
after
telling
him.
they
could
have
interviewed
the
lawyer
for
the
athletic
board,
who
is
the
one
that
has
the
notes
and
found
out
from
him
that
burnett
lied
to
him
when
he
first
came
up
there
about
telling
him
he
didn't
have
a
record.
and
he
found
out
that
he
did;
that
he
promised
this
lawyer
that
he
would
not
sell
or
keep
on
to
trying
to
pedal
this
toward;
that
he
wouldn't
sell
it.
on
the
very
next
day,
he
was
over
in
a
hotham
hotel
with
mr.
graham
selling
it.
they
could
have
found
that
out
merely
by
going
to
mr.
bowwick.
and
certainly,
they
could
have
interviewed
the
principals
involved.
coach
butts
and
coach
bryant,
i
think
they
would
--
american
way
of
life
i
think
that
before
you
were
convicted
and
condemned,
you
would
are
least
entitled
to
be
confronted
and
to
be
heard
and
right
there
be
sentenced.
when
post
went
ahead
and
published
this
story
after
my
telegram.
it
knew,
because
i
was
representing
mr.
butts
so
it
should
have
known
that
it
was
in
for
a
libel
suit.
i
put
them
on
notice
it
was
false.
i
knew
mr.
bryant
was
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
sued
at
birmingham
at
the
very
moment.
so
when
they
paid,
i
say,
when
they
pay
burnett
the
final
$3,000
after
they've
got
my
telegram
and
run
the
story
on
his
witness
affidavit
that
did
brought
two
more
officers.
and
as
the
record
will
show,
when
he
took
the
deposition
of
the
editor
in
new
york
of
the
post,
he
had
entered
them
pay
or
issued
them
memorandum
just
so
it
would
purports
to
his
stand.
he
is
an
incidentally
very
fine
man.
i'm
not
criticizing
him
but
he
had
an
editorial
policy
which
he
calls
sophisticated
mockery.
he's
going
to
have
an
expose
type
of
magazine,
this
is
the
post,
he's
going
to
hurt
people,
hit
people
where
they
hurt.
so
in
the
next
memorandum
and
then
i'm
through,
he
said
to
his
staff,
“you're
doing
a
great
job
as
evidenced
by
six
libel
suits
that
are
now
been
filed
against
us
and
not
consider
that
as
a
yardstick
of
the
occurring
at
my
editorial
policy.”
so,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
suggest
or
i
honestly
urge
that
the
lower
court
be
affirmed,
all
that
the
writ
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
suppose
it
will
accomplish
too
much
of
the
stage
of
the
argument
for
me
to
stand
too
much
time
on
doctrine
of
new
york
times
and
whether
or
not
our
client,
mr.
butts,
is
a
public
official
within
that
definition
nor
whether
or
not
the
matter
that
was
--
the
subject
of
this
magazine
story
was
a
newsworthy
event.
but
before
getting
along
to
that
portion
of
new
york
times
which
if
it
does
apply
to
the
first
two
issues
that
is
public
official
and
newsworthy
event.
clearly
the
way
this
case
or
this
story
was
worked
up
and
was
investigated
and
published,
clearly
beyond
in
a
scintilla
the
question
of
a
doubt
it
would
produce
amount
to
actual
malice,
i
want
to
say
first
that
i
do
not
concede.
certainly,
mr.
butts
is
not
a
public
official
within
new
york
times
as
new
york
times
has
written
at
that
time.
now
there
had
been
decisions
written
since
then
garrison,
rosenblatt
and
of
course,
as
this
court
stated,
time
against
hill
does
not
a
libel
case
and
is
not
to
be
considered
by
the
bar
as
a
libel
case.
so
maybe
the
definition
of
public
official
has
been
somewhat
relaxed
since
the
decision
by
this
court
in
new
york
times.
but
i
would
remind
the
court
that
the
arguments
made
by
my
distinguished
opponent
that
mr.
butts
was
working
for
a
state
university
as
an
athletic
director,
to
me
it
would
make
no
more
difference
than
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
athletic
director
and
the
head
football
coach
at
the
university
of
notre
dame
or
at
yale
university
or
at
harvard
because
they
are
not
tax
supported
of
institution.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
mr.
justice
clark,
if
he
has
been
successful
as
a
coach
and
he's
recognized
as
such
and
gets
a
fine
reputation,
i
say
that
he
is
a
public
figure
because
i
don't
see
how
i
can
deny
him
to
be
a
public
figure
in
candor
whatever
a
public
figure
might
be.
i'll
say
he
is
someone
whose
name
appears
in
the
paper
often.
now
if
that
makes
him
a
public
figure
certainly,
i
candidly
and
fairly
state
that
he
would
be.
but
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
yes,
sir.
he
would
have
been
a
public
man.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
that
would
give
the
news
but,
i
mean
the
magazine
a
privilege
to
comment
upon
his
activities
or
his
own
conduct.
now,
on
this
question
of
public
man
or
public
figure,
one
whose
name
appears
in
the
paper
everyday
is
going
to
be
quite
a
problem
somewhere
along
the
line
for
the
courts
to
delineate
what
is
or
who
is
and
who
is
not
a
public
figure.
for
example
in
atlanta,
we
have
a
community
chess
drive
every
year
and
the
head
of
that
community
chess
drive
name
is
in
the
paper,
pictures
in
the
paper
everyday.
does
he
thereby
become
a
public
figure
in
fair
game
for
comment
on
the
times?
now,
let
me,
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
the
head
of
the
community
chess
drive
would
be
a
public
man
but
i
think
if
the
court
extends
its
definition
of
public
official
and
to
the
public
man
or
the
public
figure
domain
then
i
think
you
get
pretty
close
to
it
anybody
whose
name
in
the
paper,
featured
in
the
paper
more
than
twice.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
correct,
correct.
no
official
connection.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
yes,
he
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
so
i'm
not
going
to
belabor
that
public
official
argument.
i
don't
want
to
be
considered
as
having
waived
it
by
in
our
argument
any
further
but
i
have
a
point
made
in
the
brief
and
we
would
like
to
have
it
considered.
but
going
down,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
the
story
itself
and
that
after
all
is
that
what
i
consider
to
be
what
we
have
a
trying
here
today
really
aside
from
technicalities.
we
assume
new
york
times
applies.
we
have
a
limitation,
which
was
even
recognized
and
followed
in
the
non-libel
case
or
the
invasion
of
the
right
of
privacy
case
being
the
hill
case.
and,
of
course,
that
if
the
publication
is
false
and
if
it
is
published
with
reckless
disregard
of
its
falsity,
then
under
garrison
and
then
on
the
time
against
hill,
it
is
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
does
this
case
--
to
the
facts
of
this
case
term
within
that
language?
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
highly
important
to
look
at
this
publication
and
what
curtis
publishing
company
actually
had
to
say
about
the
respondent.
this
was
not
a
report
of
maybe
in
some
nebulous
claim
as
to
how
he
was
handling
funds
as
the
key
director
or
as
to
whether
or
not
the
convicts
were
brutal
with
his
family
when
they
were
there.
this
is
most
serious
indictment
that
could
ever
in
my
mind
be
made
or
belittle
of
colored
student
and
i
think
it's
in
--
it's
a
test
to
petition
for
certiorari.
the
editorial
itself
which
i
will
read
and
then
pass
along,
this
sets
the
stage
not
since
the
chicago
white
sox
through
the
1919
world
series
has
there
been
a
sports
story
as
shocking
as
this
one.
this
is
a
story
of
one
fixed
game
of
college
football.
before
they
reversed
the
georgia
played
the
university
of
alabama
last
september
1922,
wally
butts,
athletic
director
of
georgia,
gave
paul
‘bear'
bryant,
head
coach
of
alabama,
georgia's
place,
defense
patterns,
all
these
significant
secrets
which
georgia's
football
team
possessed.
the
corrupt
here
were
not
professional
ball
players
known
wrong
as
in
the
1919
black
sox
scandal.
the
corrupt
were
disreputable
gamblers
as
in
the
scandals
continually
affecting
college
basketball.
the
corrupt
were
two
men,
butts
and
bryant,
employed
to
educate
and
to
guide
young
men.
how
prevalent
is
the
fixing
of
college
football
games?
how
often
do
teachers
sell
out
their
pupils?
we
don't
know,
yet
for
now
we
can
only
be
uphold.
in
the
body
of
the
article
which
is
a
test
with
the
petitioner
and
particularly
on
the
last
page,
the
editors
recognized
and
i
read
the
last
paragraph,
“the
chances
are
that
wally
butts
will
never
help
any
football
team
again”.
bear
bryant
may
well
fall
a
hand
into
oblivion.
a
special
hale
for
that
gram
extra
word
for
in
the
variant
real
sense,
he
betrayed
the
boys
he
was
pledged
to
lead
so
i
say,
careers
will
be
ruined.
that
i
saw
i
say,
that
story
was
published
about
a
post
with
full
knowledge
of
what
effect
it
would
have
upon
the
respondent
and
the
respondent
is
the
only
one
with
whom
i
have
this
minimum
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
the
evidence
for
the
--
about
the
plaintiff,
i
mean
the
one
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
like
going
to
the
plaintiff.
the
defendant
consisted
of
a
man
who
wrote
the
notes,
the
man
by
the
name
of
burnett,
it
consisted
of
the
head
football
coach
of
the
university
of
georgia,
who
testified
in
effect
that
the
only
thing
out
of
all
those
pockets
of
notes
that
we
have
here
that
he
saw
that
would
indicate
anything
to
anybody
where
the
two
formations
known
in
football
as
a
pro
set
and
slugged
formation.
each
of
which,
georgia
had
used
the
year
before
so
there
wasn't
any
secret
about
it.
in
support
of
truth,
that's
all
he
said.
and
actually
put
off
with
a
couple
of
assistant
coach
just
who
said
“no
more”
and
then
they
rested.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
there
was
evidence
from
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
--
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
i
heard
the
question.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
there
were
telephone
records
showing
that
there
was
a
telephone
call
between
the
two
partners
on
the
date
not
the
one
mentioned
in
the
magazine
or
they
put
it
on
either
one
day
or
before,
and
that
there
was
another
one
on
the
16th
of
september
between
these
two
parties.
the
same
telephone
records
showed
that
the
parties
have
talked
back
and
forth
with
each
other,
almost
daily.
certainly
every
week,
that
coach
bryant
for
example,
talked
to
every
coach
in
southwest
including
coach
del
rona,
its
all
in
this
in
record.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
yes.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
there
was.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
the
record
will
support
me
when
i
say
that
neither
party
had
any
independent
recollection
of
any
particular
telephone
conversation
that
they
had.
they
did
know
they
talked
often.
they
talked
about
matters
of
equal
interest
to
both
of
them
involving
rules
infractions
and
protecting
ball
players
from
getting
hurt.
they
talked
all
the
time.
that
seems
to
be
the
football
coach
is
hobby
as
to
call
up
one
of
his
competitors
and
discuss
business
with
him.
not
what
has
been
accused
of
hill.
but
where
this
thing
started
was
mr.
beddow,
whose
name
has
been
referred
to
here
earlier,
who
was
opposed
birmingham
attorney,
set
word
to
mr.
strubing
that
burnett,
the
man
in
atlanta
had
a
story
worth
looking
into
because
it
involved
bear
bryant,
who
was
suing
them
in
birmingham.
they
said
that
burnett
had
intercepted
a
telephone
conversation
five
months
previously
between
coach
butts
and
coach
bryant.
that
mr.
burnett's
friend,
john
carmichael,
was
with
them
at
the
time
this
conversation
was
going
on
and
discussed
it
with
him
after
it
was
concluded.
curtis
hired
a
freelance
sports
writer
by
the
name
of
frank
graham,
who
had
never
written
a
major
football
story
before,
to
go
to
atlanta
and
interview
burnett.
they
told
graham
before
he
went,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
record,
page
722,
“if
the
story
seems
to
be
working
out”,
whatever
that
means,
“not
to
worry
about
money.
money
was
no
other.”
graham
went
to
atlanta
and
he
interviewed
burnett.
but
he
didn't
interview
carmichael,
whom
he
knew
had
been
pressed.
graham
was
told
by
burnett
that
he
had
made
these
notes
of
what
was
said
but
they
didn't
have
possession
of
them
at
the
time
he
was
being
interviewed
by
graham
and
therefore
his
recollection
of
what
was
said
was
vague.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
i
don't
know
where
he
said
there
might
be
but
i
do
--
i
know
where
they
were.
it
would
be
out
of
the
record
maybe
if
i
said
so
but
--
mr.
william
h.
schroder
--
they
didn't
ask
for
them.
they
were
available.
they
could
have
been
gotten.
said,
it
were
--
memory
was
sort
of
vague
because
the
conversation
had
taken
place
five
months
ago
and
it
didn't
have
his
notes.
anyway,
graham
said
in
effect,
give
me
an
affidavit
about
what
you
remember
anyway
and
i'll
pay
you
$2,000
for
your
affidavit.
and
i'm
going
to
take
you
back
to
new
york
and
i'll
submit
it
to
my
employers
up
there
and
if
they
think
its
good
enough,
strong
enough,
we'll
pay
you
$3,000
more
if
we
have
the
exclusive.
this
coupled
with
graham
and
the
post
knowledge
that
burnett
had
a
criminal
record
for
bad
check
rate.
it's
so
important
that
the
--
that
to
ensure
accuracy
i
will
quote
from
graham's
testimony
itself
taken
by
us
in
new
york
on
a
discovery
deposition.
since
the
affidavit
formed
the
real
core
of
the
story,
except
from
some
quotations
from
various
people,
most
of
which
quotations
was
subsequently
denied
under
oath
at
the
trial.
the
record
at
page
39,
question:
“other
than
what
is
set
forth
in
this
affidavit?”
now,
i'm
examining
mr.
graham
in
new
york,
he
has
this
affidavit.
but
he
has
secured
from
graham
in
atlanta.
“other
than
what
is
set
forth
in
this
affidavit,
there
was
no
discussion
as
to
the
substance
of
the
conversation
between
butts
and
bryant?”
answer
he
says,
“no.
just
that
he
was
he
couldn't
remember
anything
definite
about
it.”
this
is
quote.
he
said
“without
his
notes”.
so,
i
say
when
i
return
into
the
article
in
the
magazine
about
halfway
down
the
first
column.
there
is
a
paragraph
which
reads,
“butts
outlined
georgia's
offensive
plays
for
bryant
and
told
them
how
georgia
planned
to
defend
against
alabama
at
that
time.
now,
did
burnett
furnish
you
within
a
detail
as
to
what
offense
of
players
was
discussed?”
answer,
“no.
he
just
said
that
there
was
talked
about
this
in
which
butts
mentioned
specific
time
but
he
could
not
recall.”
now,
the
peculiar
thing
here
is
that
the
post
editors
and
an
editorial
accompanying
the
article
called
it
what
i
have
just
read
to
the
court.
that
was
an
interpretation,
had
to
be
an
interpretation
of
these
notes
or
what
was
said
that
was
recollected
by
months
earlier
because
there's
only
one
party
involved
and
that
is
the
man
who
is
listening
in.
so,
the
only
source
for
this
inter
--
for
the
statement
of
story
could
be
number
one,
an
interpretation
of
burnett's
notes
by
someone
knowledgeable
in
football
language.
but
it
didn't
have
that
because
the
post
never
got
the
notes
before
publishing
the
story.
the
only
other
alternative
for
an
interpretation
would
be
that
by
burnett
of
what
he
heard
five
months
previously
given
without
the
aid
of
his
notes.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
on
the
very
date
of
the
intercepted
telephone
conversation
burnett,
while
everything
was
clear
on
his
mind
as
to
what
he
had
heard
and
with
his
notes
before
him,
told
john
carmichael
what
he
had
heard
and
how
he
had
interpreted
what
he
had
heard
that
burnett
whatever.
and
he
told
carmichael
at
that
time
and
he
so
testified
at
the
trial.
that
that
soon
after
the
conversation,
we
couldn't
even
decide
which
team
to
bet
on
because
we
didn't
know
based
on
what
i
heard
who
the
favorite
was
or
who
the
favorite
should
be?
so
we
have
burnett
interpreting
the
same
conversations
twice,
right
after
they
were
over
and
again
five
months
later,
when
he
didn't
have
his
notes
and
when
the
post
was
willing
to
pay
him
$5,000
for
it.
no
wonder,
the
post
didn't
insist
on
seeing
the
notes
before
the
publication
and
they
didn't.
no
wonder
they
didn't
want
to
interview
carmichael
because
his
interpretation
might
differ
from
what
this
fellow
put
in
his
affidavit.
no
wonder
they
made
no
further
check
into
burnett's
past,
his
history.
they
had
what
they
had
come
to
buy
and
they
never
even
contacted
burnett.
now,
if
it
please
the
court
between
the
time
they
bought
that
affidavit
and
before
they
published
it.
i
represent
wally
butts,
sent
the
post
or
telegram
which
reads
in
part,
i'm
reading
from
the
record
777.
as
coach
butt's
attorney,
“i
am
informing
you
here
and
now”.
this
has
gotten
around
what
was
the
affidavit
having
been
sold.
although
not
many
people
knew
exactly
what
was
in
it
but
they
had
the
idea.
as
coach
butt's
attorney,
“i'm
informing
you
here
and
now
of
the
falsity
of
the
charges
contained
in
the
proposed

and
to
respectfully
request
that
you
and
the
interest
of
fair
and
accurate
reporting
refrain
from
publishing
or
otherwise
releasing
the
said

so
as
to
void
--

totally
unnecessary
damage
to
my
client”.
letter
follows,
that
was
march
11th.
the
date
of
the
magazine
was
march
23rd.
on
the
same
date,
i
set
on
and
wrote
a
registered
mail
letter.
in
the
depositions,
the
editor
of
post,
this
is
in
with
the
record,
mr.
blair
acknowledged
that
he
received
them.
he
ignored
them.
he
didn't
even
acknowledged
receipt
of
them
to
me
at
that
time
and
proceeded
to
publish
the
story
as
it
has
been
written
without
making
any
changes
and
more
important
than
anything,
without
making
any
additional
investigation.
the
reason
i
sent
the
telegram,
i
wrote
the
letter.
certain,
it
was
not
laying
the
basis
for
a
libel
suit
because
i
was
sincerely
hopeful
that
no
publication
whatever
be
forth
coming.
mr.
william
h.
schroder
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
this
would
only
be
happening
in
a
very
few
case
because
you
hardly
ever
know
what
someone
had
known
to
publish
about
you
until
it's
already
published.
but
i
had
a
rumor
that
came
to
me
that
this
was
in
the
mails
and
the
record
was
shown
here
that
this
man
burnett
and
his
cohorts
had
tried
to
pedal
the
story
before
the
post
ever
bought
it.
the
record
shows
that
they
tried
to
pedal
it
to
a
radio
announcer
in
new
york
named
phil
rizzuto
and
that's
in
the
record
and
he
refused
to
touch
it.
the
word
got
to
me
that
the
post
had
bought
it.
and
i
certainly
felt,
that
the
post
being
a
responsible
member
of
the
press.
i
felt
competent
that
before
publishing
the
story
they
knew
and
so
stated
that
would
ruin
a
man's
career
and
forever
make
him,
his
children
and
his
grandchildren
bearing
his
name,
objects
of
public
hatred,
contempt,
and
ridicule.
they
would
either
kill
the
story.
the
courts
had
investigated
my
background
and
the
community
i
think
that
would
have
come
up
a
little
bit
better
than
the
man
who
had
given
the
affidavit.
either
kill
it
or
look
further
into
it.
get
in
touch
with
me
and
say,
“what
do
you
have
to
back
off
what
you
say?”
here's
what
they
could
have
done.
they
could
have
gotten
the
notes.
they
wouldn't
be
withheld
from
it.
they
could
have
submitted
them
to
an
expert
in
football,
who
would
have
told
them
as
the
experts
said
at
the
trial,
“there's
nothing
in
here
that
could
possibly
constitute
a
fixed,
a
rigged,
a
sell
out
as
the
post
has
charge.”
they
could
have
asked
for
the
film
of
the
game.
it
was
available.
the
jury
looked
at
it.
the
film
shows
exactly
what
happened
on
each
play.
to
be
brief,
the
first
three
touch
downs
scored
by
alabama
as
low
as
38
to
9.
first
three
touch
downs
was
scored
purely
as
a
result,
georgia
had
lost
to
the
sophomores,
failures
on
the
part
of
the
players
and
the
coaches
admittedly.
for
example,
i
had
offensive
halfback,
planned
defensive
halfback
for
georgia
and
the
in
run
by
him
and
joe
namath,
now
with
just
were
in
the
touchdown
phase.
the
second
touch
down
scored
when
the
georgia's
in,
got
a
position
as
first
varsity
game.
certainly,
there
was
nothing
in
those
films
that
would
suggest
a
sell
out.
that's
second
thing.
number
three,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
alabama
players
and
asked
them
whether
there
had
been
any
last
minute
changes
in
the
coaching
techniques
given
them
by
coach
bryant
and
they
would
have
found
that
there
weren't.
next,
they
could
have
call
--
they
could
have
interviewed
carmichael.
carmichael
would
have
put
an
entirely
different
slang
on
this
banded
burnett.
and
at
the
trial,
carmichael
even
testified
that
the
notes
that
burnett
brought
to
the
trial
with
him
were
not
the
same
ones
that
he
had
after
the
telephone
conversation.
and
the
post
could
have
found
that
out
just
by
interviewing
him
after
telling
him.
they
could
have
interviewed
the
lawyer
for
the
athletic
board,
who
is
the
one
that
has
the
notes
and
found
out
from
him
that
burnett
lied
to
him
when
he
first
came
up
there
about
telling
him
he
didn't
have
a
record.
and
he
found
out
that
he
did;
that
he
promised
this
lawyer
that
he
would
not
sell
or
keep
on
to
trying
to
pedal
this
toward;
that
he
wouldn't
sell
it.
on
the
very
next
day,
he
was
over
in
a
hotham
hotel
with
mr.
graham
selling
it.
they
could
have
found
that
out
merely
by
going
to
mr.
bowwick.
and
certainly,
they
could
have
interviewed
the
principals
involved.
coach
butts
and
coach
bryant,
i
think
they
would
--
american
way
of
life
i
think
that
before
you
were
convicted
and
condemned,
you
would
are
least
entitled
to
be
confronted
and
to
be
heard
and
right
there
be
sentenced.
when
post
went
ahead
and
published
this
story
after
my
telegram.
it
knew,
because
i
was
representing
mr.
butts
so
it
should
have
known
that
it
was
in
for
a
libel
suit.
i
put
them
on
notice
it
was
false.
i
knew
mr.
bryant
was
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
sued
at
birmingham
at
the
very
moment.
so
when
they
paid,
i
say,
when
they
pay
burnett
the
final
$3,000
after
they've
got
my
telegram
and
run
the
story
on
his
witness
affidavit
that
did
brought
two
more
officers.
and
as
the
record
will
show,
when
he
took
the
deposition
of
the
editor
in
new
york
of
the
post,
he
had
entered
them
pay
or
issued
them
memorandum
just
so
it
would
purports
to
his
stand.
he
is
an
incidentally
very
fine
man.
i'm
not
criticizing
him
but
he
had
an
editorial
policy
which
he
calls
sophisticated
mockery.
he's
going
to
have
an
expose
type
of
magazine,
this
is
the
post,
he's
going
to
hurt
people,
hit
people
where
they
hurt.
so
in
the
next
memorandum
and
then
i'm
through,
he
said
to
his
staff,
“you're
doing
a
great
job
as
evidenced
by
six
libel
suits
that
are
now
been
filed
against
us
and
not
consider
that
as
a
yardstick
of
the
occurring
at
my
editorial
policy.”
so,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
suggest
or
i
honestly
urge
that
the
lower
court
be
affirmed,
all
that
the
writ
be
affirmed.
