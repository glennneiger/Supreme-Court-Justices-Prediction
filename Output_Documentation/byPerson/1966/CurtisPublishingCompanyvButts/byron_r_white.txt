justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
the
sense,
aren't
you
really
saying
and
why
shouldn't
you
say
that
newspapers
are
interested
in
the
public
interest
in
reporting
news
of
the
events
especially
one
like
this,
and
the
participants
in
the
news
or
the
event
are
bound
to
be
reported.
why
should
the
press
--
why
do
you
think
the
press
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
absolute
truth?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
instance
--
wholly
aside
from
whether
the
people
involved
in
public
figures
or
public
officials
and
what
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
exactly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
start
with
you
that
supports
the
crowd
rumors?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
--
why
should
that
make
any
difference
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
think
there's
really
some
case
that
kind
of
reason
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
really
the
claim
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
don't
--
they
don't
say
that
the
press
may
deliberately
tell
the
court
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
new
york
--
the
new
york
times
rule
really
in
effect
to
protect
this
or
they
deliberately
lie?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
solely
with
the
claims
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
volume
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
volume
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
1229?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
if
--
where
is
the
--
is
the
government's
complaint
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you're
wrong
that
the
opinion
really
is
to
be
read
that
way
and
that
the
judge
has
ruled
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
of
new
york
times
type
malice?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
judge
here
apparently
didn't
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
--
these
are
plaintiffs
that
the
defendants
had
waived
this
point
because
the
judge
apparently
feel
it
was
still
on
the
case
and
not
want
n.
o.
v
to
rule
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
on
that
basis
so
there's
no
reason
for
the
judge
to
go
and
explain
why
new
york
times
and
what
did
not
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
no
reason
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
usually
are
when
they
are
embarrassing.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
point
raised
by
the
defendant's
motion
in
--
for
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
hence,
it
is
a
deliberately
false
statement
as
you
truly
found.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
the
judge
was
just
playing
along?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
when
he
says
there
--
when
he
says
there
was
no
new
york
times
take
malice,
you
say
he
was
just
plain
wrong
because
the
jury
found
exactly
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
begged
the
students
to
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
this
--
did
the
reporter
testify
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
introduce
it,
if
you
introduced
anything
from
his
deposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
introduced
statements
by
him
that
he
saw
general
walker?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
where
that
is
in
the
record
by
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
where
that
is
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
looking
for
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
the
jury
also
found
that
not
only
that
general
walker
did
not
lead
the
charge
but
that
he
did
not
even
participate
in
any
general
movement
forced
the
marshals?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
is
the
court
--
let
us
assume
the
civil
court
of
appeals
that
said
the
same
--
held
the
same
thing
in
affirming
the
reversal
of
a
punitive
damage
award
if
had
said.
assume
that
it
said,
exactly
what
the
trial
judge,
i
know
it
didn't
--
i
know
it
put
it
on
a
little
narrower
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
--
let's
just
forget
the
new
york
times
a
minute.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
that
you
denied
having
award
of
punitive
damages
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
holding,
throwing
out
punitive
damages,
doesn't
do
anything
full
of
rugs
out
one
of
the
jury's
finding
which
you
claim
you
still
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
set
aside
the
whole
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
didn't
say
that
lacks
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wechsler,
as
i
recall
your
submission
up
here
in
new
york
times,
it
was
principally
that
first
amendment
either
filed
a
libel
suit
or
it
didn't
and
you
said,
it
did.
is
that
right?
am
i
wrong
with
that?
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
make
an
argu
--
did
you
make
an
argument
that
appears
similar
to
what
the
court
finally
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
particular
argument
was
the
total
immunity
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
a
constitutional
defense,
which
would
have
precluded
the
whole
suit
wouldn't
have
destroyed
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying,
you're
suggesting
that
there's
a
trial
strategy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i'm
just
under
--
trying
to
understand
what
the
strategy
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
they
--
what
did
they
gain
that
was
worth
giving
up
the
constitutional
defense
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
pleading
in
the
constitutional
defense
wouldn't
have
gone
away
with
the
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
know
--
you
don't
know
them
whether
they
would
have
given
up
something
at
all
but
they
have
pled
the
constitutional
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
--
you
don't
know
then
but
that
that
is
a
matter
of
strategy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
new
