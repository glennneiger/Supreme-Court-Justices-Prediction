mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court.
my
partner,
mr.
schroder
and
i
will
divide
this
argument.
i
will
speak
briefly
and
address
my
remarks
only
to
the
question
that
is
to
whether
curtis
waived
any
constitutional
claims
that
may
have
had.
mr.
schroder
will
argue
the
merits
of
the
case
and
whether
or
not
--
and
the
reasons
why
times
v.
sullivan
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
we
contend
that
curtis
did
in
fact
waive
any
constitutional
claims
that
it
may
have
had.
the
court
of
appeals
held
among
things
that
curtis
did
in
fact
waive
those
claims
knowingly
and
that
they
obviously
decided
upon
another
strategy
defense
which
they
used.
now
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
followed
precisely
the
guidelines
that
have
been
fixed
by
this
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
claim.
this
court
held
in
the
case
of
zerbst
v.
johnson
or
johnson
v.
zerbst,
i
believe
it
is,
decided
in
our
brief
that
the
guidelines
for
determining
whether
waiver
has
occurred
is
the
intentional
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
of
privilege
and
this
court
said
in
determining
whether
the
right
is
known.
the
court
expressed
the
need
to
examine
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
case.
now,
does
the
court
of
appeals
also
cited
in
his
decision
upholding
--
holding
wavier?
this
court
decision
in
the
yacus
case,
yacus
v.
united
states
in
which
this
court
said,
“no
procedural
principle
is
more
familiar
to
this
court
than
that
a
constitutional
right
may
be
profited
in
criminal
as
well
as
civil
cases
by
the
failure
to
make
any
timely
assertion
of
a
right
before
a
tribunal
having
jurisdiction
to
determine
it.”
now,
what
are
the
facts
which
--
and
circumstances
which
brought
the
court
of
appeals
to
its
decision
that
could
just
did
waive
any
constitutional
claims
that
they
may
have
had?
they
are
simple.
they
are
clear.
we
said
they
are
convincing
and
they
are
as
follows.
in
early
1963,
before
the
article
involved
in
this
case
was
published,
curtis
publishing
company
published
in
article
concerning
paul
bryant,
the
coach
of
the
university
of
alabama.
he
sued
curtis
on
the
basis
of
that
article
and
on
february
26,
curtis
filed
his
defensive
answer
and
pleadings
in
that
first
paul
bryant
suit.
and
mr.
strubing
here,
general
counsel
for
curtis
was
in
the
alabama
case
along
with
mr.
t.
eric
embry
by
the
time
of
beddow,
embry
and
beddow
and
as
mentioned
by
mr.
wechsler,
that
prime
was
at
that
time
counsel
in
alabama
for
the
times
in
times
v.
sullivan.
at
that
particular
time,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
already
decided
the
times
case
and
it
was
on
certiorari
to
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
decision
that
in
the
certiorari,
curtis
made
its
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
identical
to
those
which
they
are
asserting
here.
now,
they
filed
that
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
the
federal
court
in
alabama
in
that
first
suit.
in
addition
to
that,
they
also
filed
the
public
man
defense
or
claim.
now,
we
have
in
georgia
a
statute,
a
public
man
statute
privilege
which
i
will
point
out
in
just
a
minute
that
they
did
not
even
apply
as
a
defense
in
this
case.
now
that
was
on
early
february,
february
26th,
one
month
later,
approximately
on
march
23,
1963,
the
article
that
is
here
involved
in
this
case
was
published
by
curtis
in
which
they
called
“wallace
butts,
paul
bryant
corrupt”
and
that
they
“fixed
and
rigged”
the
1962
game.
a
request
for
retraction
was
had
been
urged
upon
curtis.
they
did
not
make
any
retraction.
two
days
later,
on
march
the
25th,
wallace
butts
filed
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
georgia.
in
that
case,
again,
mr.
strubing,
who
obviously
had
to
be
familiar
of
course
with
the
first
and
fourteenth
privilege
claims
because
he
had
just
gone
through
it
one
month
before
in
filing
those
claims
in
alabama
in
behalf
of
curtis
in
the
first
bryant
suit.
in
defense
of
the
--
of
this
case,
the
butts
case
in
georgia,
curtis
did
not
file
any
constitutional
claim
defenses
whatsoever.
they
did
not
even
file
the
public
man
privilege
that
was
provided
for
in
the
georgia
law,
although,
they
had
filed
the
public
man
privilege
claim
in
the
bryant
cases
in
alabama.
within
a
less
than
a
month
after
this
suit
of
butts
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
in
georgia,
paul
bryant
filed
a
companion
case
again
in
the
federal
court
in
alabama,
again
of
course
represented
by
mr.
strubing
as
general
counsel
for
curtis
and
mr.
t.
erick
embry
of
the
same
law
firm.
and
again,
they
filed
in
the
second
bryant
suit,
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
and
the
public
man
defense
again.
the
butts
co
--
we
say,
that
those
facts
conclusively
show
that
mr.
strubing,
the
general
counsel
for
curtis,
was
well
aware
of
those
amendments,
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims,
as
being
a
privilege
to
which
curtis
was
entitled.
now,
the
butts
case
came
to
trial
in
georgia
before
either
one
of
the
bryant
cases
came
to
trial
in
alabama.
mr.
strubing,
we
were
delighted
to
have
him,
came
to
georgia
and
for
the
trial
of
this
case,
he
brought
with
him
mr.
t.
erick
embry,
counsel
in
the
times
case,
which
was
then
before
this
court
and
he
also
brought
mr.
roderick
beddow
of
the
same
firm
from
birmingham.
they
sat
throughout
the
butts
trial
for
over
two
weeks
trial
at
the
curtis'
counsel
table
along
with
its
atlanta
counsel
and
at
no
time
did
they
ever
raise,
did
they
ever
request
the
court
to
charge
any
constitutional
amendment
claims
of
privileges
whatsoever.
now,
when
the
strategy
failed
and
their
strategy
was
of
course
to
try
that
case
on
the
defense
of
truth
alone.
now,
the
reason
why
they
came
to
that
decision?
we
don't
know.
we
are
not
concerned
with
it
really
but
it
was
their
decision.
immediately,
after
their
strategy
failed
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
no,
sir.
we
--
we
of
course,
were
not
going
to
raise
in
--
or
suggest
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
don't
know,
sir.
no,
sir.
they
--
oh!
well!
oh,
they
took
advantages
of
that
true
defense
because
they
were
thereby
able
to
get
the
opening
and
concluding
argument
by
reason
of
having
pled
through
that
is
justification.
and
under
the
georgia
law,
they
thus
had
the
right
to
open
and
conclude.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
don't
know
what
they
decided
about
that.
that
was
their
decision.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well,
whatever
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well,
the
valuable
right
to
open
and
conclude
within
a
jury
argument
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
don't
know,
justice
white,
why
they
did
it.
but
the
fact
is
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well,
if
they
had
pled
the
constitutional
defense.
i
do
not
know
what
the
--
what
position
they
would
have
taken
about,
whether
or
not
they
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
they
had
to
go
forward
with
that
burden.
i
just
don't
know
about
that.
i
do
know
this
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
we
can
only
of
course
conclude
they
knew
all
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
that
were
available
to
them
and
they
used
them
in
the
two
bryant
cases
and
they
didn't
use
in
hill.
and
when
this
strategy
failed,
they
immediately,
on
their
first
motion
for
new
trial
which
they
had
to
file
within
ten
days
or
thereabout
after
the
verdict
was
in
them.
they
for
the
very
first
time
raised
their
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
and
the
record
shows.
it
was
not
later
on
in
march
of
‘64
or
in
january
of
'64
that
they
first
come.
however,
now,
what
i
want
to
point
out
to
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
that
they
would
not
--
i
cannot
state
that
as
a
fact.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
because,
that
is
the
only
defense
that
they
filed.
now,
they
may
have
wanted
to
get
a
verdict
in
georgia.
they
thought
that
they
possibly
might
have
or
get
a
chance
to
get
a
verdict
of
georgia
on
the
plea
of
truth
alone
as
a
means
of
trying
to
discredit
bryant
in
alabama
in
his
cases.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
do
not.
i
do
not
and
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
would
not
held.
but
i
am
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
why
do
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
say
that
we
have
to
assume
that
that
was
their
trial
tactic
and
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
because
they
had
--
they
had
used
those
defenses
in
alabama
and
they
certainly
could
have
--
in
georgia
and
they
did
not
and
we
--
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
reach
the
same
conclusion
exactly
and
it's
in
their
decision
and
you
will
find
that
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“we
do
not
know
why
they
chose
this
strategy.
it
very
likely
could
have
been.”
and
that
is
in
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
the
new
york
times
decision
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
no,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i'm
ba
--
i'm
basing
it
on
the
fact
that
you
--
as
pointed
in
our
brief.
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
which
show
that
all
the
warnings
and
signs
had
been
given
that
the
court
would
un
--
most
likely,
i
will
put
it,
would
have
--
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
had
did
reached
in
--
in
time
they
resolve
the
case.
i
only
have
just
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
yes,
sir.
it
says
that
in
effect
that
--
it
is
the
privilege
to
comment
upon
the
--
well,
the
matters
of
--
let
me
find
that
specifically.
yes,
yes,
yes,
if
you
would
like
me
to
answer.
it
is,
of
course,
the
georgia
statute,
“comments
upon
the
acts
of
public
men
in
their
public
capacity
and
with
reference
thereto
are
deemed
privilege
communication.”
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
absolutely.
and
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
in
its
decision
since
we
do
have
such
limited
time.
i
will
conclude
my
statement
by
asking
you
to
please
read
carefully
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
had
to
say
about
the
subject
of
waiver
and
how
obviously
curtis
knew
that
it
had
these
constitutional
claims
and
did
not
make
them
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court.
my
partner,
mr.
schroder
and
i
will
divide
this
argument.
i
will
speak
briefly
and
address
my
remarks
only
to
the
question
that
is
to
whether
curtis
waived
any
constitutional
claims
that
may
have
had.
mr.
schroder
will
argue
the
merits
of
the
case
and
whether
or
not
--
and
the
reasons
why
times
v.
sullivan
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
we
contend
that
curtis
did
in
fact
waive
any
constitutional
claims
that
it
may
have
had.
the
court
of
appeals
held
among
things
that
curtis
did
in
fact
waive
those
claims
knowingly
and
that
they
obviously
decided
upon
another
strategy
defense
which
they
used.
now
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
followed
precisely
the
guidelines
that
have
been
fixed
by
this
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
claim.
this
court
held
in
the
case
of
zerbst
v.
johnson
or
johnson
v.
zerbst,
i
believe
it
is,
decided
in
our
brief
that
the
guidelines
for
determining
whether
waiver
has
occurred
is
the
intentional
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
of
privilege
and
this
court
said
in
determining
whether
the
right
is
known.
the
court
expressed
the
need
to
examine
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
case.
now,
does
the
court
of
appeals
also
cited
in
his
decision
upholding
--
holding
wavier?
this
court
decision
in
the
yacus
case,
yacus
v.
united
states
in
which
this
court
said,
“no
procedural
principle
is
more
familiar
to
this
court
than
that
a
constitutional
right
may
be
profited
in
criminal
as
well
as
civil
cases
by
the
failure
to
make
any
timely
assertion
of
a
right
before
a
tribunal
having
jurisdiction
to
determine
it.”
now,
what
are
the
facts
which
--
and
circumstances
which
brought
the
court
of
appeals
to
its
decision
that
could
just
did
waive
any
constitutional
claims
that
they
may
have
had?
they
are
simple.
they
are
clear.
we
said
they
are
convincing
and
they
are
as
follows.
in
early
1963,
before
the
article
involved
in
this
case
was
published,
curtis
publishing
company
published
in
article
concerning
paul
bryant,
the
coach
of
the
university
of
alabama.
he
sued
curtis
on
the
basis
of
that
article
and
on
february
26,
curtis
filed
his
defensive
answer
and
pleadings
in
that
first
paul
bryant
suit.
and
mr.
strubing
here,
general
counsel
for
curtis
was
in
the
alabama
case
along
with
mr.
t.
eric
embry
by
the
time
of
beddow,
embry
and
beddow
and
as
mentioned
by
mr.
wechsler,
that
prime
was
at
that
time
counsel
in
alabama
for
the
times
in
times
v.
sullivan.
at
that
particular
time,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
already
decided
the
times
case
and
it
was
on
certiorari
to
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
decision
that
in
the
certiorari,
curtis
made
its
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
identical
to
those
which
they
are
asserting
here.
now,
they
filed
that
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
the
federal
court
in
alabama
in
that
first
suit.
in
addition
to
that,
they
also
filed
the
public
man
defense
or
claim.
now,
we
have
in
georgia
a
statute,
a
public
man
statute
privilege
which
i
will
point
out
in
just
a
minute
that
they
did
not
even
apply
as
a
defense
in
this
case.
now
that
was
on
early
february,
february
26th,
one
month
later,
approximately
on
march
23,
1963,
the
article
that
is
here
involved
in
this
case
was
published
by
curtis
in
which
they
called
“wallace
butts,
paul
bryant
corrupt”
and
that
they
“fixed
and
rigged”
the
1962
game.
a
request
for
retraction
was
had
been
urged
upon
curtis.
they
did
not
make
any
retraction.
two
days
later,
on
march
the
25th,
wallace
butts
filed
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
georgia.
in
that
case,
again,
mr.
strubing,
who
obviously
had
to
be
familiar
of
course
with
the
first
and
fourteenth
privilege
claims
because
he
had
just
gone
through
it
one
month
before
in
filing
those
claims
in
alabama
in
behalf
of
curtis
in
the
first
bryant
suit.
in
defense
of
the
--
of
this
case,
the
butts
case
in
georgia,
curtis
did
not
file
any
constitutional
claim
defenses
whatsoever.
they
did
not
even
file
the
public
man
privilege
that
was
provided
for
in
the
georgia
law,
although,
they
had
filed
the
public
man
privilege
claim
in
the
bryant
cases
in
alabama.
within
a
less
than
a
month
after
this
suit
of
butts
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
in
georgia,
paul
bryant
filed
a
companion
case
again
in
the
federal
court
in
alabama,
again
of
course
represented
by
mr.
strubing
as
general
counsel
for
curtis
and
mr.
t.
erick
embry
of
the
same
law
firm.
and
again,
they
filed
in
the
second
bryant
suit,
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
and
the
public
man
defense
again.
the
butts
co
--
we
say,
that
those
facts
conclusively
show
that
mr.
strubing,
the
general
counsel
for
curtis,
was
well
aware
of
those
amendments,
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims,
as
being
a
privilege
to
which
curtis
was
entitled.
now,
the
butts
case
came
to
trial
in
georgia
before
either
one
of
the
bryant
cases
came
to
trial
in
alabama.
mr.
strubing,
we
were
delighted
to
have
him,
came
to
georgia
and
for
the
trial
of
this
case,
he
brought
with
him
mr.
t.
erick
embry,
counsel
in
the
times
case,
which
was
then
before
this
court
and
he
also
brought
mr.
roderick
beddow
of
the
same
firm
from
birmingham.
they
sat
throughout
the
butts
trial
for
over
two
weeks
trial
at
the
curtis'
counsel
table
along
with
its
atlanta
counsel
and
at
no
time
did
they
ever
raise,
did
they
ever
request
the
court
to
charge
any
constitutional
amendment
claims
of
privileges
whatsoever.
now,
when
the
strategy
failed
and
their
strategy
was
of
course
to
try
that
case
on
the
defense
of
truth
alone.
now,
the
reason
why
they
came
to
that
decision?
we
don't
know.
we
are
not
concerned
with
it
really
but
it
was
their
decision.
immediately,
after
their
strategy
failed
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
no,
sir.
we
--
we
of
course,
were
not
going
to
raise
in
--
or
suggest
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
don't
know,
sir.
no,
sir.
they
--
oh!
well!
oh,
they
took
advantages
of
that
true
defense
because
they
were
thereby
able
to
get
the
opening
and
concluding
argument
by
reason
of
having
pled
through
that
is
justification.
and
under
the
georgia
law,
they
thus
had
the
right
to
open
and
conclude.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
don't
know
what
they
decided
about
that.
that
was
their
decision.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well,
whatever
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well,
the
valuable
right
to
open
and
conclude
within
a
jury
argument
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
don't
know,
justice
white,
why
they
did
it.
but
the
fact
is
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well,
if
they
had
pled
the
constitutional
defense.
i
do
not
know
what
the
--
what
position
they
would
have
taken
about,
whether
or
not
they
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
they
had
to
go
forward
with
that
burden.
i
just
don't
know
about
that.
i
do
know
this
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
we
can
only
of
course
conclude
they
knew
all
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
that
were
available
to
them
and
they
used
them
in
the
two
bryant
cases
and
they
didn't
use
in
hill.
and
when
this
strategy
failed,
they
immediately,
on
their
first
motion
for
new
trial
which
they
had
to
file
within
ten
days
or
thereabout
after
the
verdict
was
in
them.
they
for
the
very
first
time
raised
their
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claims
and
the
record
shows.
it
was
not
later
on
in
march
of
‘64
or
in
january
of
'64
that
they
first
come.
however,
now,
what
i
want
to
point
out
to
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
that
they
would
not
--
i
cannot
state
that
as
a
fact.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
because,
that
is
the
only
defense
that
they
filed.
now,
they
may
have
wanted
to
get
a
verdict
in
georgia.
they
thought
that
they
possibly
might
have
or
get
a
chance
to
get
a
verdict
of
georgia
on
the
plea
of
truth
alone
as
a
means
of
trying
to
discredit
bryant
in
alabama
in
his
cases.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
well
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
do
not.
i
do
not
and
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
would
not
held.
but
i
am
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
why
do
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i
say
that
we
have
to
assume
that
that
was
their
trial
tactic
and
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
because
they
had
--
they
had
used
those
defenses
in
alabama
and
they
certainly
could
have
--
in
georgia
and
they
did
not
and
we
--
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
reach
the
same
conclusion
exactly
and
it's
in
their
decision
and
you
will
find
that
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“we
do
not
know
why
they
chose
this
strategy.
it
very
likely
could
have
been.”
and
that
is
in
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
the
new
york
times
decision
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
no,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
i'm
ba
--
i'm
basing
it
on
the
fact
that
you
--
as
pointed
in
our
brief.
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
which
show
that
all
the
warnings
and
signs
had
been
given
that
the
court
would
un
--
most
likely,
i
will
put
it,
would
have
--
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
had
did
reached
in
--
in
time
they
resolve
the
case.
i
only
have
just
--
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
yes,
sir.
it
says
that
in
effect
that
--
it
is
the
privilege
to
comment
upon
the
--
well,
the
matters
of
--
let
me
find
that
specifically.
yes,
yes,
yes,
if
you
would
like
me
to
answer.
it
is,
of
course,
the
georgia
statute,
“comments
upon
the
acts
of
public
men
in
their
public
capacity
and
with
reference
thereto
are
deemed
privilege
communication.”
mr.
allen
e.
lockerman
absolutely.
and
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
in
its
decision
since
we
do
have
such
limited
time.
i
will
conclude
my
statement
by
asking
you
to
please
read
carefully
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
had
to
say
about
the
subject
of
waiver
and
how
obviously
curtis
knew
that
it
had
these
constitutional
claims
and
did
not
make
them
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
