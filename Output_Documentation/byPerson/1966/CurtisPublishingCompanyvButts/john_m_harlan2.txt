supposing

had
been
a
problem
of
a
student
leader
in
the
campus
as
he
done
what
the
record
shows
was
done
here,
would
you
say

it
will
all
be
a
public
figure
on

out
the
reasons
for
the
logical
conclusion
that
this
was
always
you
think
in
saying
that
all
faith
under
the

because
obviously,
a
libel
law
does
impose
an
inhibiting
effect
on
absolute
freedom
of
