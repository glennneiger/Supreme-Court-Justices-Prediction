black
has
he
won
all
of

justice

black
may
i
ask
you
if
all
of
this
is
a
part
of
the
facts
that
have
been
decided
against
by
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
extensive
statement
of
facts
in
connection
to
leading
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
he
denied,
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
claim
that
the
evidence
is
so
undecided
like
the
thompson
case
unrevealed
that
a
case
should
be
reversed
on
the
basis
of
wrongful
finding
of
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
legal
question,
mr.
rogers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
--
but
you
say
it
was
in
dispute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
believe
it.
we'll
be
upheld
by
the
time
in
disputing
the
evidence
the
decision
one
way
or
the
other
would
violate
due
process,
have
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
sir,
that
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
those
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
those
cases?
justice
hugo

black
is
that
in
mississippi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
general
walker
state
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
why
he
went
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
opposed
carrying
out
the
presidential
decree
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
sent
them
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
sent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
who
sent
the
troop
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
went
up
there
to
object
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
went
up
to
the
place
to
object
to
the
troops
being
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
went
there
to
protest
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
carrying
out
of
the
president's
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
that's
what
he
said
he
went
there
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
that
not
the
substance
of
what
he
said
he
went
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
try
to
prevent
its
being
carried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
he
ever
said
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
he
ever
said
about
going
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
that
you
know
whether
the
record
actually
shows
but
you
said
he
went
there
to
protest
against
the
presidential
order
being
carried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
those
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
say
that
by
inference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
permit
me
to
say
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
statement
that
the
president
--
the
chief
just
read
to
you
to
indicate
that
he
went
there
and
that
he
was
doing
best
to
lead
and
if
he
didn't
lead
and
trying
to
frustrate
the
president's
order,
he
then
go
as
far
as
he
wanted
to
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
he
have
made
the
speech
there?
it's
not
to
frustrate
the
president's
action
unless
he
was
trying
to
be
the
leader?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
what
he
said,
he
was
going
there
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
went
there
to
protest
what
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
american
army
was
doing,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
had
right
on
the
ground

it
enunciated

you
are

your
claim
for
waiver
on

should
have
anticipated

sometime
announce
