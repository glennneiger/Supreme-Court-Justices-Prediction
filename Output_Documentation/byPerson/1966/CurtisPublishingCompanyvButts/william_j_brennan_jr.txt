justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rogers
tell
me,
did
you
--
did
you
asked
that
it
be
submitted
to
the
jury
this
proposition
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
or
not
he
had,
as
you
put
it,
thrust
himself
into
the
middle
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
account
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
ask
them?
did
you
ask
them
that
there
be
a
charge
predicated
on
the
application
of
the
times
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
refused?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rogers,
what
--
in
relation
to
the
date
of
the
decision
in
time
from
sullivan
when
was
this
case
actually
tried?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
is
that
--
what
was
the
time,
did
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
it
had
been
decided
by
the
time
this
case
went
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
noticed
you
don't
cite
it,
mr.
rogers.
if
you
suggest
that
proposition,
then
i
wonder
why
you
don't
make
some
reference
to
time
and
hill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mentioned?
i
didn't
see
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
garrison
did,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
garrison.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
--
may
i
just
ask
you,
what
you
are
going
to
tell
us
is
that
part
of
the
trial
record?
i
mean,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
--
just
interests
me
something
like
this
if
there's
no
effort
at
the
trial
to
establish
that
there
was
a
connection
between
the
complaint
filed
--
this
initial
release,
the
author
of
that
release
and
the
author
of
that
release
has
one
of
it
supporting
the
government's
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
in
--
if
they
are
in
the
trial
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
claim
the
associate
press
putting
him
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
watts,
may
i
ask
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
pages
70
and
71
of
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
apparently
is
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge,
i
gather
on
the
associated
press'
motion
for
a
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
--
isn't
it
his
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
he
is
stating
the
reasons
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
why
he
is
acting
as
he
speaks
in
the
letter.
he's
going
to
act
on
the
motions
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
now
he
says
at
the
bottom
here
of
page
70,
he
goes
through
the
matter
of
actual
malice
and
he
detailed
it
and
he
concludes
that
negligence
was
involved.
but
then
goes
on
to
say,
“wisdom
in
good
judgment
do
not
necessarily
come
with
age
nor
are
they
necessarily
deny
view.”
in
my
opinion,
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
then
he
cites
william
carter
publisher
co.
over
the
little
page,
it's
called
the
panhandle
publishing
company
support
these
conclusions.
the
conclusion
being
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
malice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
citation
of
new
york
times
in
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
whether
these
opinions
of
the
trial
judge
at
least
it
could
be
read
that
he
concluded
there
was
no
malice
in
the
new
york
times
since
to
proved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
did
you
seek
any
review
of
his
setting
aside
the
award
of
punitive
damages
as
construed
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
lost
that
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
lost
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
least
to
that
extent,
whatever
is
the
reason,
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
judge
that
you
were
entitled
of
punitive
damages
has
been
sustained
all
to
the
there
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
tell
me
this
mr.
watts,
the
trial
court
said,
“i
failed
to
ascertain
of
the
failure
to
check
such
a
minor
discrepancy,
could
be
construed
as
that
entire
amount
of
care
which
would
amount
to
a
conscience
--
conscious
indifference
to
the
rights
of
plaintiff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
reckless
disregard
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
conscious
indifferences,
it
is
something
like
reckless
disregard
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
watts,
this
is
predicated
primarily
on
--
that
this
purports
to
be
an
eyewitness
account
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--what
happened
by
the
representative
of
the
associated
press
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--who
says
this
is
what
he
saw.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
suppose
really,
what
you
and
i
looking
at
the
same
conduct
of
general
walker,
i
might
honestly
believe
he's
leading
something
and
he
might
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
all
going
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
don't
know
--
i
just
wonder
whether
that
establishes
necessarily
that
the
young
reporter
deliberately
lied
when
he
said
he
led
them.
he
might
very
well
have
the
impression
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
watts,
before
you
put
down,
i
want
to
get
back
to
whether
i
could
see
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
trial
judge
did
say
at
page
72.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it's
the
record.
“since,
i
have
determined
that
that
there
is
no
actual
malice
in
this
case.
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
the
rule
of
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
was
to
prohibit
the
public
official
that
covering
damages
for
libel
when
there's
no
actual
malice,
should
apply
to
a
public
figure
such
as
plaintiff.
if
it
does,
then
the
entire
jury
verdict
must
be
set
aside
and
judgment
entered
for
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
not
--
isn't
that
a
finding
by
the
trial
judge
that
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
times
malice
in
the
case;
that
if
there
were,
the
whole
verdict
would
have
to
be
set
aside
and
the
only
reason
they
didn't
set
aside
on
compensatory
damages
was
that
he
concluded
that
a
public
figure
was
not
a
public
official
for
purposes
in
new
york
times
rule.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
old
dictum
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
rather
embarrassing
in
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
hope
mr.
rogers
you're
going
to
tell
us
why
you
didn't
ask
for
a
--
specifically
for
a
new
york
times
charge,
you
didn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you
did
not
ask
expressly,
did
you,
for
new
york
times
charge
that
was
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
have
made
the
argument,
frankly,
mr.
rogers
without
saying
new
york
times
apply
and
we
request
an
instruction
which
the
court
with
new
york
times
rule.
that's
what
usual
way
of
doing
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
rogers,
what
is
going
to
do
with
the
court
of
appeals
could
--
that
doesn't
seem
it
--
it
sustained
trial
judge.
but
it
does
sustain,
this
is
at
page
1547
and
1548.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that's
in
1548?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
it
says
is
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
says
is,
in
view
of
all
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
rapid
and
complete
turn
of
events
in
case
in
question
is
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
we
hold
that
the
appellee
prove
--
found
to
prove
malice
as
defined
and
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
setting
aside
such
findings.
i
don't
know
what
that
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
definition
in
find
--
in
special
verdict
number
4,
the
trial
judge
read
that
out
of
the
case
and
court
of
appeals
doesn't
seem
put
the
fact
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact
--
in
fact,
affirming
setting
--
taking
out
under
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
--
i
notice
the
court
of
appeals
cites
two
other
cases
and
trial
judge
cited
both
the
texas
cases
cites
a
third
texas
case
because
not
cite
new
york
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
because
he
was
not
a
public
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wechsler,
let
me
--
am
i
mr.
wechsler,
at
the
time
of
this
alleged
incident
occurred
the
game
fix.
he
was
not
the
coach,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
head
of
the
community
chess
drive,
would
not
be
a
public
man
under
the
statute
because
he
was
no
public
duty
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
mr.
butts
did
have
public
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rogers
tell
me,
did
you
--
did
you
asked
that
it
be
submitted
to
the
jury
this
proposition
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
or
not
he
had,
as
you
put
it,
thrust
himself
into
the
middle
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
account
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
ask
them?
did
you
ask
them
that
there
be
a
charge
predicated
on
the
application
of
the
times
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
refused?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rogers,
what
--
in
relation
to
the
date
of
the
decision
in
time
from
sullivan
when
was
this
case
actually
tried?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
is
that
--
what
was
the
time,
did
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
it
had
been
decided
by
the
time
this
case
went
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
noticed
you
don't
cite
it,
mr.
rogers.
if
you
suggest
that
proposition,
then
i
wonder
why
you
don't
make
some
reference
to
time
and
hill.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mentioned?
i
didn't
see
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
garrison
did,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
garrison.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
--
may
i
just
ask
you,
what
you
are
going
to
tell
us
is
that
part
of
the
trial

i
mean,
what

you

justice
william

brennan,

well,
mr.

may
i
ask
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
pages
70
and
71
of
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
apparently
is
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge,
i
gather
on
the
associated

for
a

justice
william

well,
is

isn't

his

justice
william
j.

in

he
is
stating
the

why
he
is
acting
as
he

he's

the

what
about
the

times
in
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
whether
these
opinions
of
the
trial
judge
at
least
it
could
be
read
that
he
concluded
there

in

lost
that
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
you
lost
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
least
to
that
extent,
whatever
is
the
reason,
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
judge
that
you
were
entitled
of
punitive
damages
has
been
sustained
all
to
the
there
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
tell
me
this
mr.
watts,
the
trial

said,
“i

no.
conscious

it
is
something
like
reckless

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
gather
mr.
watts,
this
is
predicated

on
--
that
this
purports

of

he

justice
william

brennan,

and
this
was
all
going
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
don't
know
--
i
just
wonder
whether
that
establishes
necessarily
that
the
young
reporter
deliberately
lied
when
he
said
he
led
them.
he
might
very
well
have
the
impression
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
watts,
before
you
put
down,
i
want
to
get
back
to
whether
i
could
see
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
trial
judge
did
say
at
page
72.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it's
the
record.
“since,
i
have
determined
that
that
there
is
no
actual
malice
in
this
case.
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
the
rule
of
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
was
to
prohibit
the
public
official
that
covering
damages
for
libel
when
there's
no
actual
malice,
should
apply
to
a
public
figure
such
as
plaintiff.
if
it
does,
then
the
entire
jury
verdict
must
be
set
aside
and
judgment
entered
for
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
not
--
isn't
that
a
finding
by
the
trial
judge
that
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
times
malice
in
the
case;
that
if
there
were,
the
whole
verdict
would
have
to
be
set
aside
and
the
only
reason
they
didn't
set
aside
on
compensatory
damages
was
that
he
concluded
that
a
public
figure
was
not
a
public
official
for
purposes
in
new
york
times
rule.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
old
dictum
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
rather
embarrassing
in
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
hope
mr.
rogers
you're
going
to
tell
us
why
you
didn't
ask
for
a
--
specifically
for
a
new
york
times
charge,
you
didn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you
did
not
ask
expressly,
did
you,
for
new
york
times
charge
that
was
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
have
made
the
argument,
frankly,
mr.
rogers
without
saying
new
york
times
apply
and
we
request
an
instruction
which
the
court
with
new
york
times
rule.
that's
what
usual
way
of
doing
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
rogers,
what
is
going
to
do
with
the
court
of
appeals
could
--
that
doesn't
seem
it
--
it
sustained
trial
judge.
but
it
does
sustain,
this
is
at
page
1547
and
1548.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that's
in
1548?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
it
says
is
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
says
is,
in
view
of
all
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
rapid
and
complete
turn
of
events
in
case
in
question
is
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
we
hold
that
the
appellee
prove
--
found
to
prove
malice
as
defined
and
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
setting
aside
such
findings.
i
don't
know
what
that
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
definition
in
find
--
in
special
verdict
number
4,
the
trial
judge
read
that
out
of
the
case
and
court
of
appeals
doesn't
seem
put
the
fact
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact
--
in
fact,
affirming
setting
--
taking
out
under
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
--
i
notice
the
court
of
appeals
cites
two
other
cases
and
trial
judge
cited
both
the
texas
cases
cites
a
third
texas
case
because
not
cite
new
york
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
because
he
was
not
a
public
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wechsler,
let
me
--
am
i
mr.
wechsler,
at
the
time
of
this
alleged
incident
occurred
the
game
fix.
he
was
not
the
coach,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
head
of
the
community
chess
drive,
would
not
be
a
public
man
under
the
statute
because
he
was
no
public
duty
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
mr.
butts
did
have
public
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
