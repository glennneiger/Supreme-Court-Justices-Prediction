mean
when
he
said
before
this

“rise

for

now
is

10,000

it

--
it

now

the
time
is
when
and
if
the
president
of
the
united

commits
or
uses
any
troop,
federal
or
state
in
mississippi.
the
last
time
in

a

i
was

that
was
in

arkansas
in
1957
and
'58.
this
time,
i'm
out
of
uniform
and
i'm
on
the
right
side,
and
i
would
be
there.”
now,
isn't
that
something
of
a
call
to
arms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
10,000
from
every
state
in
the
union
to
come
to
a
troubled
area
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
inflammatory
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
he
told
them
all
to
come
and
told
him
that
he
would
be
there.
and
he
was
there
and
he
did
something,
wouldn't
that
be
an
indication
that
there
was
some
leadership
in
the
affair?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
just
--
and
not
just
a
bystander
who
was
there
to
see
what
happened?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
have
to
say
of
this
testimony
of
a
deputy
sheriff
who
was
a
--
as
i
understand
it,
was
witness
of
the
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
some
of
the
crowd
has
asked
walker,
if
he
would
led
them?
he
stepped
down
from
the
side
of
the
monument
and
said,
“keep
protesting
and
see
if
we
can
get
closer.”
he
then
started
toward
the
marshals
and
the
crowd
of
at
least
a
thousand
by
that
time
followed
him.
this
crowd
was
armed
with
sticks,
rocks,
coca-cola
bottles,
and
other
things
as
i
have
heretofore
stated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
moment,
please.
they
seem
to
have
anything
that
they
could
get
their
hands
on
and
when
they
got
close
enough,
they
would
throw
towards
the
marshals.
when
the
front
of
this
crowd
which
general
walker
was
with,
got
in
about
200
feet
of
the
marshals,
they
fired
another
blast
of
teargas
and
the
crowd
ran
back
with
general
walker
with
them.
at
all
times,
during
this,
i
was
near
in
sight
of
general
walker
and
stayed
inside
of
him
until
about
5:00
a.m.
the
next
morning.
on
a
number
of
occasions,
walker
would
walk
toward
the
marshals
or
in
that
general
direction
and
whenever
he
did,
a
large
crowd
would
fall
in
behind
and
followed
him.
in
fact,
wherever
marshals
went,
the
crowd
followed.
during
the
time
after
the
first
march
toward
the
marshals
with
walker
in
or
near,
lead
i
heard
different
statements,
many
of
which
i
cannot
remember.
but
at
one
time
in
talking
with
group
about
the
protest,
they
were
making
--
he
said,
“good!
good,
keep
it
up.”
i
heard
people
asking
how
to
snap
out
or
counteract
the
teargas
and
walker
told
them
to
use
water
and
right
after
that
they
got
a
fire
truck
and
hose
and
begun
to
try
to
use
that
to
stop
the
gas.

did

has

wouldn't

wouldn't
that
have
