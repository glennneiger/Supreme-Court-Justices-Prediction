fortas
do
you
have
in
the
record
in
reference
to
your
request
for
a
charge
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
regard
that
as
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law
whether
he
was
a
public
figure
within
the
new
york
times?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
the
question
is,
do
you
think
that
issue
whether
a
particular
person
in
a
particular
setting
is
a
public
figure,
is
a
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
jury?
unless
you
had
thought
that
maybe
it
was
or
you
wouldn't
have
asked
for
the
instruction?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would
also
find,
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you'd
also
find
out,
mr.
rogers,
a
connection
whether
there's
any
instruction
--
i
don't
really
remember
that
there
was
any
instruction
to
the
jury
at
all
on
the
public
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
is
there
any
statement
by
the
court
or
any
ruling
by
the
court
as
to
why
--
why
not
or
what
the
trial
court's
view
was?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
looks
in
effect
a
ruling
by
the
trial
court
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
general
walker
was
not
a
public
figure.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
kind
of
thing
is
this
given
on
page
29,
is
that
a
letter
of
counsel
or
it
is
fully
indicate
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
general
walker
--
i'm
having
some
trouble
with
the
thrust
of
your
argument
that
is
--
are
you
telling
us
that
whether
a
man
is
a
public
figure
for
purposes
of
new
york
times
depends
upon
what
he
did?
that
is
to
say
suppose
general
walker
had
here
just
made
a
speech,
suppose
he
had
come
down
to
the
university
and
went
on
campus
and
just
made
a
speech,
no
violence,
nothing
else,
and
then
there's
been
a
libelous
article
published
by
associated
press.
now,
is
that
--
would
he
--
would
that
still
bring
him
--
will
he
still
be
within
a
public
figure
within
new
york
times
or
it
does
--
is
this
vortex
idea
of
an
essential
part
of
it
and
the
sense
that
you've
got
to
be
part
of
the
violence
and
commotion
of
the
incident?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
jury
found
that
against
you?
justice
abe
fortas
what
in
fact
is
the
question
of
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
my
own
question
would
be
is
suppose
you
took
general
walker
as
he
walks.
and
suppose
he
went
down
to
the
university
of
mississippi
and
then
mentioned
with
the
meredith
matter,
and
suppose
all
he
did
was
to
make
a
speech.
and
then
that
speech
and
the
ap
dispatched
as
libelous
and
let's
suppose
the
speech
was
rather
particularly
inflammatory.
would
general
walker
be
a
public
figure
for
purposes
new
york
times?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
the
associated
press
published
an
article
about
general
walker
and
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
university
of
mississippi.
well,
let's
suppose
that
his
private
life
or
i
suppose
that
time
or
what
--
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
public
figure
at
all
but
that
dealt
with
his
private
life?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
general
rogers,
i
wonder
if
that
really
is
in
fact
the
position
that
you
want
to
impress
on
this.
suppose
somebody
named
“john
doe”
had
appeared
out
of
nowhere
and
had
participated
in
this
university
of
mississippi
disturbance,
the
same
way
and
suppose
the
associated
press
carry
the
story
about
him.
and
that
story
was
not
true
and
he's
damage
and
then
he
brought
suit.
now
would
it
or
would
it
not
the
position
that
new
york
times
nevertheless
supplies
that
john
doe
that
came
out
of
nowhere
and
participated
in
a
public
event
in
a
way
that
attracted
a
lot
of
attention.
what
is
it?
i
mean
to
say,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
roger,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
as
i
understand
it
is
the
first
amendment.
and
the
question
is,
what's
the
other
report
by
the
press
is
entitled
to
some
kind
of
protection
over
and
above
what
is
included
in
the
interstate
libel
law?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then,
that
is
our
inquiry
or
inquiries
about
the
first
amendment
and
the
question
of
whether
the
person
is
a
public
figure
or
whether
it's
news
were
--
would
proceed
to
into
some
other
problems
in
time
against
hill
and
are
subordinate
to
that
inquiry.
but
you're
pitching
your
argument
here,
as
i
understand
it,
entirely
on
public
official
question?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
on
what
basis
do
you
say
as
i
guess
you
must
that
this
course
of
events
was
the
--
was
approximately
caused
by
the
associated
press
story?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
it
followed
the
release?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
general
rogers
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
abe
fortas
general
rogers
said
that
it's
customary
in
texas
to
have
rulings
in
the
form
of
a
letters.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
this
letter
anyway?
justice
abe
fortas
of
course,
it
was
a
--
it
wasn't
an
argument
--
but
it
was
an
explanation
of
a
ruling.
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
given
to
the
clerk
for
entry
as
part
of
the
papers
in
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rogers,
was
there
a
demand
for
retraction
served
on
the
associated
press
here?
justice
abe
fortas
in
no
time?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
--
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
a
situation
in
which
the
daily
press
has
to
report
a
story
in
hot
blood
so
to
speak
in
a
situation
in
which
like,
let
us
say
time
against
hill,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
investigation
with
respect,
i
have
to
ask
you
now
the
question
that
goes
to
theory
at
this?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
suppose
that
it's
arguable
in
many
kind
of
a
situation
that
mr.
x
did
not
lead
the
crowd
but
the
crowd
followed
mr.
x.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
there's
that
kind
of
a
subject
development
that
may
enter
into
this
one?
justice
abe
fortas
this
suit
was
before
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
suit
was
before
new
york
times?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
the
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wechsler,
what
--
when
was
the
--
exactly
when
was
the
60
(b)
motion
filed?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
after
appeal
had
been
taken
from
the
trial
court?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
was
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
the
first
time
that
sullivan
was
invoked?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
--
do
you
have
convenient
at
hand
or
the
date
of
our
decision
in
sullivan?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
consider
the
public
official
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
consider
the
public
official
on
the
new
york
times
question
a
question
of
law
or
in
fact
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
it's
something
that
the
jury
has
to
decide?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you've
been
the
quarterback
of
the
team
instead
of
the
coach?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
exactly
the
same
facts.
you
called
mister
--
now
this
man's
name
is
and
told
him
what
to
plays
or
the
particle
alleged
that
he
called
the
coach
of
the
other
team
and
told
him
what
to
plays
were.
justice
abe
fortas
whom
exactly
the
same
facts
but
that
instead
of
being
the
coach,
he
was
the
quarterback.
it's
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
think
that
new
york
times
would
not
apply
in
that
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
i
noticed
that
you
phrase
it
carefully.
justice
abe
fortas
instead
of
us
were
--
what
you're
really
coming
back
to
is
the
absolute
immunity
doctrine?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
but
you
have
applied
that
to
prevent
suit
by
anybody
regardless
of
the
public
official
or
public
position
doctrine
because
that's
--
if
you
take
my
illustration
of
the
quarterback
or
let's
suppose
that
that
was
a
substitute
spent
the
entire
season
on
the
bench
whether
he
knew
what
the
plays
were.
and
exactly
the
same
facts
or
i
suppose
that
--
would
you
argue
there
that
new
york
times
should
provide
immunity?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
--
but
taking
in
that
today,
i
suppose
that
the
controversial
exception
of
pornography,
the
rule
that
you
have
just
suggested
would
cover
everything
that's
published?
justice
abe
fortas
it
depends
of
our
decisions
made.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
so,
the
--
what
you've
come
down
to,
mr.
wechsler,
is
that
you
would
require
the
new
york
times
standards
to
be
met
in
any
area
covered
by
the
first
amendment
regardless
of
the
characteristics
of
the
person
who
is
liable,
that
is
to
say
whether
he
is
“a
public
official
or
public
figure
or
not?”
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
realistically
anywhere
where
it
has
legal
effects
won't
matter.
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
sort
of
hot
blood
story
which
you
had
in
the
preceding
case
and
a
situation
like
this
were
in
effect
the
publication
is
the
originator
of
the
story
and
the
investigator
and
plenty
of
time
to
write
it
and
investigate
it.
and
i
suppose
that
realistically,
there
is
differences
to
the
standards
to
which
a
publication
can
be
ill
with
due
regard
for
safeguarding
the
values
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
the
doctrine
of
strict
liability
has
in
fact
resulted
in
the
suppression
of
liberty?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
has?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
refer
to
--
you
referred
to
a
public
man
defense
in
the
georgia
law
well
could
you
without
taking
too
much
time
tell
me
what
that
is?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
they
did
not
raise
that
defense?
they
did
not
raise
that
defense
in
this
litigation
and
from
that
you
assume
that
gives
you
another
basis
for
assuming
that
there
was
a
deliberate
trial
strategy
for
whatever
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
fixed?
there
was
an
explanation
of
this
telephone
conversation,
wasn't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
in
the
record
in
reference
to
your
request
for
a
charge
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
regard
that
as
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law
whether
he
was
a
public
figure
within
the
new
york
times?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
the
question
is,
do
you
think
that
issue
whether
a
particular
person
in
a
particular
setting
is
a
public
figure,
is
a
question
of
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
jury?
unless
you
had
thought
that
maybe
it
was
or
you
wouldn't
have

for
the
instruction?
justice
abe
fortas
i

justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you'd
also
find
out,
mr.
rogers,
a
connection
whether
there's
any
instruction
--
i
don't
really
remember
that
there
was
any
instruction
to
the
jury
at
all
on
the
public
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
is
there
any
statement
by
the
court
or
any
ruling
by
the
court
as
to
why
--
why
not
or
what
the
trial
court's
view
was?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
looks
in
effect
a
ruling
by

as
a

i

an
argument
--
but
it
was
an
explanation
of
a
ruling.
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
given
to
the
clerk
for
entry
as
part
of
the
papers
in
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rogers,
was
there
a
demand
for
retraction
served
on
the
associated
press
here?
justice
abe
fortas
in
no
time?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
--
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
a
situation
in
which
the
daily
press
has
to
report
a
story
in
hot
blood
so
to
speak
in
a
situation
in
which
like,
let
us
say
time
against
hill,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
investigation
with
respect,
i
have
to
ask
you
now
the
question
that
goes
to
theory
at
this?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
suppose
that
it's
arguable
in
many
kind
of
a
situation
that
mr.
x
did
not
lead
the
crowd
but
the
crowd
followed
mr.
x.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
there's
that
kind
of
a
subject
development
that
may
enter
into
this
one?
justice
abe
fortas
this
suit
was
before
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
suit
was
before
new
york
times?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
the
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wechsler,
what
--
when
was
the
--
exactly
when
was
the
60
(b)
motion
filed?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
after
appeal
had
been
taken
from
the
trial
court?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
was
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
the
first
time
that
sullivan
was
invoked?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
--
do
you
have
convenient
at
hand
or
the
date
of
our
decision
in
sullivan?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
consider
the
public
official
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
consider
the
public
official
on
the
new
york
times
question
a
question
of
law
or
in
fact
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
it's
something
that
the
jury
has
to
decide?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you've
been
the
quarterback
of
the
team
instead
of
the
coach?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
exactly
the
same
facts.
you
called
mister
--
now
this
man's
name
is
and
told
him
what
to
plays
or
the
particle
alleged
that
he
called
the
coach
of
the
other
team
and
told
him
what
to
plays
were.
justice
abe
fortas
whom
exactly
the
same
facts
but
that
instead
of
being
the
coach,
he
was
the
quarterback.
it's
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
think
that
new
york
times
would
not
apply
in
that
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
i
noticed
that
you
phrase
it
carefully.
justice
abe
fortas
instead
of
us
were
--
what
you're
really
coming
back
to
is
the
absolute
immunity
doctrine?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
but
you
have
applied
that
to
prevent
suit
by
anybody
regardless
of
the
public
official
or
public
position
doctrine
because
that's
--
if
you
take
my
illustration
of
the
quarterback
or
let's
suppose
that
that
was
a
substitute
spent
the
entire
season
on
the
bench
whether
he
knew
what
the
plays
were.
and
exactly
the
same
facts
or
i
suppose
that
--
would
you
argue
there
that
new
york
times
should
provide
immunity?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
--
but
taking
in
that
today,
i
suppose
that
the
controversial
exception
of
pornography,
the
rule
that
you
have
just
suggested
would
cover
everything
that's
published?
justice
abe
fortas
it
depends
of
our
decisions
made.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
so,
the
--
what
you've
come
down
to,
mr.
wechsler,
is
that
you
would
require
the
new
york
times
standards
to
be
met
in
any
area
covered
by
the
first
amendment
regardless
of
the
characteristics
of
the
person
who
is
liable,
that
is
to
say
whether
he
is
“a
public
official
or
public
figure
or
not?”
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
realistically
anywhere
where
it
has
legal
effects
won't
matter.
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
sort
of
hot
blood
story
which
you
had
in
the
preceding
case
and
a
situation
like
this
were
in
effect
the
publication
is
the
originator
of
the
story
and
the
investigator
and
plenty
of
time
to
write
it
and
investigate
it.
and
i
suppose
that
realistically,
there
is
differences
to
the
standards
to
which
a
publication
can
be
ill
with
due
regard
for
safeguarding
the
values
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
the
doctrine
of
strict
liability
has
in
fact
resulted
in
the
suppression
of
liberty?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
has?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
refer
to
--
you
referred
to
a
public
man
defense
in
the
georgia
law
well
could
you
without
taking
too
much
time
tell
me
what
that
is?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
they
did
not
raise
that
defense?
they
did
not
raise
that
defense
in
this
litigation
and
from
that
you
assume
that
gives
you
another
basis
for
assuming
that
there
was
a
deliberate
trial
strategy
for
whatever
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
fixed?
there
was
an
explanation
of
this
telephone
conversation,
wasn't
there?
