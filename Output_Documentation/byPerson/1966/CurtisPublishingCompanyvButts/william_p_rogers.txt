mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
libel
action
in
which
general
edwin
walker
has
recovered
a
judgment
of
$500,000
against
the
associated
press
for
general
damages.
there
was
no
claim
made
nor
there
was
any
evidence
offered
that
he
suffered
any
actual
damages.
in
addition
to
the
$500,000
general
damage
as
reward,
the
jury
awarded
$300,000
in
punitive
damages.
the
trial
court
set
aside
this
award
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
malice.
the
suit
is
based
on
news
reports
concerning
walker's
activities
in
oxford,
mississippi
during
the
night
of
september
30,
1962,
a
night
when
violence
and
bloodshed
climaxed
in
attempt
by
james
meredith,
a
negro
to
enroll
as
a
student
at
the
university
of
mississippi.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
had
ordered
the
admission
of
mr.
meredith
to
the
then
all-white
university.
but
some
of
the
highest
elected
officials
in
the
state
had
asked
that
they
would
defy
the
order
of
the
federal
court
and
prevent
mr.
meredith's
admission.
the
associated
press
reported
the
events
which
followed.
the
statements
complained
of
in
this
case
were
contained
in
two
news
dispatches
dated
october
2nd
and
3rd
which
originated
with
a
local
associated
press
reporter,
who
was
on
the
campus
at
the
time
of
the
rioting
and
witnessed
the
events
which
he
reported.
those
statements
were:
one,
that
general
walker
assumed
command
of
the
crowd;
and
two,
that
he
led
a
charge
of
students
against
the
federal
marshals
who
were
there
to
see
that
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
was
carried
out.
a
basic
constitutional
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
before
the
document
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
is
to
be
confined
solely
to
public
officials
or
whether
it
should
be
extended
to
persons
like
general
walker,
who
though
not
technically
public
officials,
are
public
figures
or
persons
of
political
prominence
who
have
thrust
themselves
in
the
vortex
of
a
question
of
pressing
public
concern.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
after.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
issue
is
presented
squarely
on
this
appeal.
the
issue
before
the
new
york
times
to
be
extended
because
all
three
texas
courts,
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
courts
quite
properly
found
that
the
statements
were
published
without
any
malice
as
defined
in
the
new
york
times
case.
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution,
the
associated
press
also
claims
that
the
news
reports
were
substantially
true
and
therefore
the
judgment
represents
an
unconstitutional
denial
of
due
process.
that
an
award
of
$500,000
in
general
damages
is
unconstitutionally
oppressive
and
that
the
defense
of
“fair
comment”
as
applied
in
this
case
has
been
unconstitutionally
limited.
this
case,
i
believe,
represents
one
of
the
most
serious
attacks
ever
made
on
the
press
in
this
country.
it
is
but
one
of
the
50
libel
cases
brought
by
general
walker
against
the
associated
press,
its
members
or
both,
arising
out
of
news
reports
identical
or
almost
identical
with
the
one
involved
in
this
litigation.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
suppose
counsel
will.
the
general
has
made
claims
--
i'll
come
to
the
conflict
of
testimony
in
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
the
general
has
made
claims
against
a
significant
portion
of
the
press
asking
for
damages
totaling
more
than
$33
million.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
he's
won
the
two
that
had
been
tried.
now,
the
technique
that
he
uses
is
very
simple
and
effective.
he
is
attempting
to
convert
the
libel
laws
of
this
country
and
the
weapons
of
intimidation,
harassment,
and
punishment.
and
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
up
to
now
he's
been
very
successful.
what
gave
rise
to
the
associated
press'
dispatch
a
theory?
this
court
will
recall
the
many
months
of
legal
proceedings
involving
the
admission
of
james
meredith
to
the
university
of
mississippi.
when
he
had
finally
arrived
at
the
university
to
register
on
september
30th,
as
called
for
by
the
order
of
the
court,
this
circuit.
he
was
accompanied
by
federal
marshals,
who
were
there
to
see
that
the
order
was
complied
with.
that
evening,
when
the
word
got
around
that
meredith
was
in
the
campus,
there
occurred
what
general
walker
has
seemed
fit
to
label
a
protest.
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
violent
attacks
on
the
marshals,
federal
marshals
with
rocks,
sticks,
bricks,
bulldozers,
fire
engines,
and
molotov
cocktails.
one
deputy
marshal
had
a
leg
broken.
one
was
hit
in
the
head.
one
deputy
marshal
was
shot
in
the
back.
the
rioting
left
two
persons
dead
and
more
than
50
injured.
it
was
a
protest
which
brought
the
united
states
into
this
refute
all
over
the
world.
it
was
under
this
scene
that
general
walker
appeared.
it
was
into
this
vortex
that
he
thrusts
himself.
the
general
did
not
come
to
the
scene
unheralded.
he
made
sure
of
that.
over
a
period
of
several
days
with
a
maximum
of
fanfare,
he
announced
his
plans
in
a
series
of
telecasts,
radio
broadcasts,
and
press
conferences
as
he
made
his
way
to
oxford.
for
example
at
shreveport,
louisiana
on
september
26th
in
a
radio
broadcast.
here's
what
he
said,
“rise
to
a
stand
beside
governor
ross
barnett
of
jackson,
mississippi.
now
is
the
time
to
be
heard,
10,000
strong
from
every
state
in
the
union,
rally
to
the
cause
of
freedom,
the
battle
cry
of
the
republic.
barnett,
yes.
castro,
no.
bring
your
flag,
your
tents
and
your
skillets.
it
is
the
time,
now
or
never.
the
time
is
when
and
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
commits
or
uses
any
troops
federal
or
state
in
mississippi.
the
last
time
in
such
a
situation,
in
1957
and
1958
at
little
rock,
i
was
on
the
wrong
side.
this
time
i
will
be
on
the
right
side.
i
will
be
there”.
on
another
day,
a
day
or
two,
another
occasion
a
day
or
two
before
the
riots,
when
he
was
asked
if
he
recommended
that
the
volunteers
go
armed,
general
walker
said,
and
i
quote,
“the
administration
has
indicated
it
will
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
enforce
its
unconstitutional
action.
i
have
stated
that
whatever
is
necessary
to
oppose
that
enforcement
and
stand
behind
governor
barnett,
should
be
done”.
on
the
eve
of
the
riots,
walker
held
a
press
conference
at
oxford
and
announced
that
governor
barnett,
who
by
this
time
has
been
held
in
contempt
by
the
fifth
circuit,
was
being
supported
by
thousands
of
people
beyond
the
borders
of
mississippi,
now
on
their
way
to
join
him
at
oxford.
on
september
30th,
when
president
kennedy,
in
a
national
television
broadcast,
appealed
for
preservation
of
law
and
order,
general
walker
publicly
said,
“nauseating,
nauseating”.
the
evidence
is
clear
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
he
was
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
it
was
a
year
or
two
before
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date,
a
couple
of
years
before
that.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
he
did.
the
evidence
is
clear
and
admitted
that
walker
thrust
himself
into
the
middle
of
this
highly
charged
public
controversy.
not
only
did
he,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
rosenblatt,
thrust
himself
into
the
vortex
of
the
controversy,
but
he
played
a
major
role
in
creating
the
controversy
and
in
giving
leadership
to
those
who
sought
to
obstruct
the
order
of
the
federal
court.
now,
the
general
has
denies
it.
he
would
have
this
court
believe,
notwithstanding
all
the
broadcast,
press
conferences,
which
are
a
matter
of
record
that
he
went
to
the
campus
as
an
observer
or
as
a
spectator.
or
as
he
said
in
his
testimony,
“just
to
see
for
myself
exactly
what
happened”.
of
course,
this
is
an
outrageous
and
offensive
lie.
it
is
perfectly
obvious,
based
on
his
own
words
that
he
did
not
go
to
the
scene
as
a
spectator,
or
an
observer?
he
went
there
as
a
participant
as
an
active
collaborator.
walker
went
to
the
campus
at
oxford
for
the
stated
purpose,
in
his
own
words,
of
preventing
the
order
of
the
federal
court
from
being
carried
out,
as
he
said,
“to
be
on
the
right
side,
this
time”.
he
was
willing
and
anxious
to
do
what
he
could
to
help
that
cause
of
in
a
position
as
he
clearly
demonstrates.
in
fact
on
the
record
--
in
the
record,
he
admits
that
he
asked
the
sheriff
to
be
deputized
so
he
could
help
the
mississippi
authorities.
what
were
his
activities
when
he
arrived
to
the
campus
at
oxford?
well,
he
admits,
he
went
to
scene
of
the
rioting
at
about
8:30,
and
remained
there
on
the
campus
until
about
2
a.m.
he
was
hailed
as
the
leader
of
the
riots
--
rioters.
he
delivered
a
speech
to
the
rioters
although,
he
claimed
at
the
trial
tried
to
calm
the
rioters.
the
fact
is
that
his
speech
was
inflammatory.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
because
i
want
to
show
your
honor
that
he
thrust
himself
into
the
vortex
of
this
controversy
deliberately,
knowingly
for
the
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
but
which
is
all
a
matter
of
record.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
know
that
he
doesn't
deny
any
of
the
things
i
am
saying.
now,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we
do
make
the
argument.
there's
been
a
violation
of
due
process
because
the
evidence
clearly
supports
the
associated
press
insofar
as
the
truth
is
concerned.
but
more
than
that,
we
think
that
the
basic
constitutional
question
is
whether
the
new
york
times
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
cover
people
such
as
general
walker,
who
thrust
themselves
into
the
vortex
of
a
highly
involved
and
inflamed
public
controversy.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
plus
the
due
process
question.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
the
report
made
by
the
associated
press
was
true
and
therefore,
it
was
so
true
that
it
violates
due
process.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
think
there
are
some
cases
there.
but
as
i
said,
i
would
like,
your
honor
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no.
that
--
that
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
because
in
the
--
the
texas
courts
did
not
hold
that
the
new
york
times
rule
extended
to
people
like
general
walker.
they
limited
the
new
york
times
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
i
don't.
we
can
get
that
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we
regard
that
as
a
question
of
law.
the
facts
--
i
think
the
facts
on
his
activities
and
what
he
has
done
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
because
i
didn't
try
the
case
without
a
particular
instruction
was
included
or
not.
i
will
find
out
during
the
recess,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
i
don't
believe
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
i'm
not
sure
that
he
made
a
statement
during
the
trial.
but
the
ruling
of
the
court
was
that
the
new
york
time's
case
did
not
extend
to
anyone
except
public
officials.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it's
been
there
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--
justice
stewart,
in
that
same
opinion
you'll
notice
that
the
trial
court
said
that
the
new
york
times
rule
is
extended
to
persons
of
political
prominence
such
as
walker,
then
there
is
no
case
because
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
malice
in
this
case.
so
the
issue
is
--
was
for
the
new
york
times
rule
was
to
be
extended
to
persons
of
political
prominence
as
directly
for
this
court
in
the
clearest
form.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
it's
appellee
in
texas
--
it's
a
form
of
the
decision
of
the
court
which
is
a
letter
to
counsel,
although
that
was
the
way
he
rendered
his
opinion
in
--
the
trial
court
rendered
its
opinion.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
this
was
tried
in
june
1964.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it
was
--
it
was
just
before
that
march
‘64.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
your
honor
as
i
was
just
concluding
the
point
that
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
when
general
walker
got
to
the
campus
that
night
he
was
the
central
figure
among
the
rioters
because
of
what
he
has
said
before
he
arrived.
now,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
charge
for
the
associated
press
report
that
he
led
the
charge
of
students
against
the
marshals?
well,
the
trial
court
said,
leading
the
charge
means
encouraging
persons
and
the
charge
means
movement
towards
the
marshals.
the
evidence
showed
that
on
at
least
two
occasions
the
general
encouraged
the
crowd
and
moved
towards
the
marshals.
the
marshals
were
in
front
of
the
administration
building,
surrounding
the
administration
building,
protecting
that
building
because
the
crowd
at
that
time
i
think
thought
mr.
meredith
was
in
the
building.
the
rioters
were
on
that
what
is
called
“the
circle”,
an
area
of
about
the
size
of
two
football
fields
next
to
the
administration
building,
there's
a
flagpole
in
the
middle,
and
in
the
other
end
on
the
east
side
it's
the
confederate
monument.
now,
at
the
confederate
monument
the
general
made
his
speech
and
on
several
--
and
at
least
two
occasions
he
moved
in
the
direction
of
the
administration
building
with
people
following
him.
i
would
like
to
just
quote
a
couple
of
comments,
one
from
mr.
john
king,
who
was
the
manager
of
the
local
radio
station.
who
heard
walker
say
to
the
crowd,
“you're
doing
fine.
riot!
you're
getting
news
all
over
the
country.
now
you've
got
casualties”.
a
clear
description
of
what
happened
that
night.
i
think
it's
important
because
this
is
the
description
given
by
one
of
walker's
own
witnesses.
a
man
named
mr.
whit,
who
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
who
was
on
the
campus
at
the
time,
and
who
was
with
walker
during
the
whole
evening.
and
that
two
--
about
two
months
after
the
events,
he
gave
a
statement
to
the
lawyers
of
associated
press,
and
in
the
statement
he
said
these
things
and
it
was
a
signed
statement
by
the
deputy
sheriff,
“after
some
of
the
crowd,
i'd
asked
walker
if
he
would
lead
them.
he
stepped
out
and
sat
at
the
monument
and
said,
keep
protesting
and
see
if
we
could
get
closer”.
and
he
then
started
toward
the
marshals
and
the
crowd
at
least
a
thousand
by
this
time
followed
him.
this
crowd
was
armed
with
sticks,
rocks,
coca-cola
bottles
and
other
things
as
i
heretofore
stated.
they
seem
to
have
anything
they
could
get
their
hands
on.
and
when
they
got
close
enough,
they
would
throw
them
towards
the
marshals.
when
the
front
of
this
crowd,
which
general
walker
was
with,
got
in
about
200
feet
to
the
marshals,
they
fired
another
blast
of
tear
gas
and
the
crowd
ran
back,
with
general
marshal
--
general
walker
with
them.
now
as
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
wasn't
making
that
argument.
i
was
making
the
argument
that
the
ap
dispatches
were
true.
in
just
a
moment,
i
thought
i
would
come
to
the
argument
that
you
referred
to.
i
think
in
this
situation
the
dispatches
by
the
ap
were
actually
true.
but
i
think
furthermore
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
it's
clear
that
under
these
circumstances
where
the
case
was
tried,
as
i
will
point
out
in
louisiana,
a
companion
case
was
tried,
the
jury
there
was
asked
for
in
the
complaint
to
award
the
judgment
of
two
million
and
a
quarter
against
the
associated
press
and
they
brought
it
back
to
verdict
of
$3
million.
so,
it's
pretty
clear
that
in
the
climate
of
today
in
the
civil
rights
field
especially
the
question
of
truth
that
if
it
has
to
be
decided
by
juries
at
this
time,
is
going
to
be
very
inhibiting
as
far
as
first
amendment
constitutional
right
is
concerned,
because
newspapers
and
magazines,
and
television
stations
just
will
not
be
willing
to
risk
judgments
of
this
kind.
will
not
be
willing
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
the
question
of
law
that
you
ask
about
whether
i
think
that
making
a
speech
would
in
itself
suggest
that
he
was
a
man
of
political
prominence
i
think
is
difficult
to
answer.
it
would
depend
on
what
he'd
done
prior
to
the
speech?
what
he
said
in
his
speech?
and
the
nature
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
the
speech.
i
think
there
could
be
no
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
if
you
assume
in
addition
to
what
you
assume
that
all
the
other
things
that
general
walker
has
done
prior
to
the
time
he
made
the
speech,
my
answer
would
be,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
but
i
--
not
at
all,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it's
the
nature
of
his
activities.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--
and
plus
what
he's
done.
for
example
in
this
case,
general
walker
resigned
from
the
army
because
he
said
he
wanted
to
engage
in
political
controversy.
he
was
a
candidate
for
governor
of
texas
just
a
few
months
before
the
events
at
the
university
of
mississippi.
he
was
a
member
of
the
john
birch
society
and
achieved
national
status
with
a
political
following
of
his
own.
his
political
following
is
called
friends
of
walker.
and
paradoxically,
in
the
light
of
--
i
think
that
this
is
interesting
that
he
admitted
that
he
is
paid
to
make
speeches.
and
in
these
speeches,
generally
speaking,
he
maligns
public
officials
with
whom
he
disagrees.
that's
pretty
clear
your
honor
that
the
decisions
of
far-reaching
political
and
social
importance
are
often
significantly
influenced
by
views
and
activities
of
public
men
who
are
not
technically
public
officials.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
answer
those
questions
because
i
would
have
to
know
what
the
student
leaders
have
done.
and
if
didn't
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
well,
i
would
think
then
that
the
--
he
would
--
it
would
cover
him,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
assuming
he'd
done
all
the
things
that
general
walker
has
done.
if
he
had
a
political
following
of
his
own,
if
he
had
made
speeches
all
over
denouncing
the
federal
courts,
if
he
haven't
run
for
political
office
the
fact
he
was
student
leader
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
and
if
he
had
gotten
out
on
the
campus
and
encouraged
the
mob
to
riot
and
applauded
when
he
found
out
that
there
were
casualties,
i
would
say
that
the
new
york
times
rule
should
cover
him.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
do.
i
agree
with
that
and
that
is
what
we
are
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
i
would
if
the
person
was
a
person
of
some
political
prominence
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
can't
imagine
--
i
can't
imagine
the
situation
where
the
court
might
now
want
to
extend
the
rule
quite
that
broadly.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we've
mentioned
it.
we
figured
the
court
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
of
course
it
came
out
after.
i
think
our
--
it
was
decided
after
our
brief
was
prepared,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
time
in
the
hill
case
does
suggest
that
as
well
as
we
indicated
i
think
the
rosenblatt
suggests
that
and
the
garrison
case
suggests
that.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it
was
--
i
think
about
eight
months
before
or
six
months
before
something
like
that.
he
has
been
defeated
by
that
time
but
he'd
been
during
that
that
year.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
would
not
think
in
that
case,
it
would
be
covered
by
the
new
york
times
rule
because
it
would
have
--
new
york
times
rule
is
limited
to
official
conduct
and
i
think
that
if
new
york
times
has
extended
itself
it
will
be,
it
would
have
to
conclude
the
same
ambit
and
that
would
be
public
activities
involving
matters
of
political
controversy.
so
i
would
answer
your
question,
i
would
think
it
would
not
cover
private
activities
of
general
walker.
i
would
like
--
just
in
closing
this
portion
of
my
argument
to
point
out
that
--
that
upholding
it
just
extends
the
new
york
times
rule
to
this
case
will
not
fully
resolve
the
constitutional
issue
of
this
as
we
see
it.
the
threat
inherent
in
the
pendency
of
these
suits
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
threat
inherent
in
the
pendency
of
these
suits,
the
burdens
of
these
lawsuits.
there
are
15
of
them
in
10
states,
as
i
say
asking
for
$33
million
are
themselves
unconstitutionally
inhibiting
because
newspaper
just
can't
afford
to
report
an
events
of
this
kind
if
they're
going
to
be
faced
with
litigation
of
this
type.
for
example,
the
associated
press
now
has
a
bond
of
--
in
louisiana,
over
half
a
million
dollars,
in
the
--
in
texas
i
mean
in
louisiana
case,
we
have
--
because
the
times
(inaudible)
also
sued.
the
bond
required
there
was
$3,375,000.
each
defendant
has
$1,250,000
in
cash
on
deposit.
so
that
here
the
fact
is
that
if
a
man
such
as
general
walker
decides
to
sue
in
areas
where
the
facts
are
going
to
be
decided
by
juries
and
obviously,
you're
very
emotionally
involved
in
the
public
controversy.
then
the
threat
--
then
the
threat
is
so
serious
that
the
press
is
going
to
be
inhibited
in
what
they
report.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
i
do,
justice
harlan.
i
think
that
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
where
a
man
sets
out
to
become
a
political
figure,
who
says
he
resigns
from
the
army
to
engage
in
political
controversy,
is
a
candidate
for
governor,
who
has
a
large
political
following
of
its
own
that
help
to
support
him?
when
he
engages
in
matters
of
this
kind
where
he
attempts
to
obstruct
the
order
of
a
federal
court
being
carried
out
and
the
report,
i
think
in
this
case,
as
i've
said
is
true
but
when
it's
presented
to
a
jury
in
texas
that
tends
to
side
with
the
views
of
general
walker
as
they
brought
in
a
large
verdict.
they
brought
in
that
$300,000
verdict
for
punitive
damages
and
the
court
very
clearly
says
there
was
no
evidence
of
malice.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
may
i
just
say,
i
--
i
would
like
to
urge
that
the
rule
extend
to
that
person.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
i
would
hope
from
the
standpoint
of
the
press
that
the
court
will
see
fit
to
go
that
far.
i
think
there
is
a
considerable
difference
though
in
the
case
that
you
proposed
in
this
case.
and
that
in
this
case,
if
the
associated
press
had
written
about
the
united
states
marshal,
he
would
have
had
no
cause
of
action.
the
associated
press
says
the
same
thing
about
general
walker
who
has
been
a
100
times
more
active
in
the
field
of
civil
rights
than
the
single
united
states
marshal,
then
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
$33
million
and
he's
already
has
two
judgments.
so,
as
far
as
general
walker
is
concerned
in
this
case,
i
think
that
there's
no
doubt
about
it;
that
the
new
york
times
rule
has
to
be
extended
to
cover
him.
i
would
also
hope
that
it
would
be
extended
to
cover
the
case
as
you
cite.
your
honor,
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
i
say,
i
do
after
the
court
extends
the
rule
that
far.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
think
he
may
have.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
one
of
the
reasons
i
hesitate
to
answer
because
in
the
hill
case,
it
wasn't
a
libel
suit.
it
really
was
there
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
civil
rights
statute
in
new
york
and
i
hesitate
to
say
that
the
court
has
because
there
may
be
some
members
that
who
wouldn't
agree
with
me.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
your
honor.
i
hope
that
i
have
not
given
that
impression.
i
think
that
i'm
pitching
my
argument
here
on
the
facts
in
this
case
because
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
rule
that
the
new
york
times
still
extends
to
walker.
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
rule
that
the
issue
of
malice
has
been
determined
and
therefore
is
conclusively
determined
in
the
--
so
that
these
other
15
law
suits
don't
have
to
be
tried.
and
insofar
as
the
rest
of
your
question
is
concerned,
i
think
the
rule
should
be
extended,
not
only
the
person
with
political
prominence
but
to
public
events
that
reported.
and
if
the
type
of
situation
that
you
suggest,
the
persons
is
out
of
the
blow
and
takes
part
in
this
kind
of
an
activity,
thrust
himself
in
the
vortex
of
that
controversy
at
that
time,
the
rule
should
cover
him.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
briefly
to
answer
some
of
the
things
that
been
said
here.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
your
honor,
the
judge
--
it
was
conceded
to
begin
with
in
the
trial
that
he
was
a
public
figure,
that
walk
was
a
public
figure.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
because
--
no,
the
court
ruled
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
did
not
apply
to
a
public
figure
like
walker,
as
he
said
in
his
opinion.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we
--i
think
we
made
the
argument
at
the
new
york
times
doctrine
applied.
i
don't
think
we
asked
the
jury
because
i
it
was
conceded--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
i
say
the
--
i
think
that
the
reason
trial
counsel
didn't
is
because
there
was
a
concession
that
walker
was
a
public
figure
and
it
was
understood
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
rule
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
people
like
general
walker.
and
that
was
the
opinion
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
he
did
in
his
opinion.
there
was
big
surprise
--
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i'm
not
sure
about
the
timing
of
it
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
suppose
also
that
just
to
speak
about
counsel
who
tried
the
case.
i
suppose
that
that's
the
time
he
felt
that
it
was
a
matter
of
law
and
so
he
didn't
asked
for
the
instruction.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
would,
if
i
may
--
i'd
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised.
first,
in
answer
to
judge
fortas'
question,
the
letter
opinion
is
an
opinion
of
the
court
and
it
was
filed
in
the
court
and
i
just
checked
on
mr.
guyton
in
texas
and
he
said
that
is
the
--
a
traditional
way,
customary
way
of
filing
opinion
of
the
court.
secondly,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
chief
justice's
questions
of
mr.
watts
about
a
deputy
sheriff
whit.
and
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
he
had
testified
about
that
statement?
now,
the
statement
was
taken
about
two
months
after
the
events.
each
page
was
signed
by
the
deputy
marshal
--
deputy
sheriff,
his
name
is
whit.
and
when
he
testified
for
general
walker,
he
was
asked
these
questions
and
they
appear
on
page
280.
“i
hand
you
what
purports
to
be
a
statement.”
“yes,
sir”.
“is
that
your
signature
on
each
page?”
“that's
my
signature;
that's
my
statement”.
“did
you
make
this
statement?”
“i
did.”
“did
you,
in
making
that
statement
tell
the
truth
as
you
knew
it
at
that
time?”
“the
best
i
knew
how.”
“do
you
think
at
that
time
you
made
the
statement
if
the
matters
you
now
put
in
that
statement
were
true
and
the
best
of
your
knowledge
and
belief?”
“well,
i
told
it
the
best
i
could
think
of
it
then”.
in
addition
to
that
statement,
there
is
that
story
written
by
mr.
gregory
of
the
merit,
a
merit
in
a
newspaper,
which
is
a
local
newspaper
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
it
points
out
that
walker
led
a
charge
against
the
marshals.
and
it
points
out
the
good
many
other
things
that
were
said
in
the
ap
story.
in
addition
to
that,
the
upi
reporter
who
has
said
testified,
and
he
testified
at
page
963
in
the
record,
and
here's
what
the
upi
reporter
said,
“after
the
speech,
walker
stood
there
for
a
short
time.
he's
talking
about
the
speech
he
made
at
the
monument.
then
he
turned
to
his
left
and
sat
down
to
the
monument
to
face
the
lyceum.
that's
the
administration
building.
it
took
several
steps
up
to
walk
and
then
when
the
two
men
caught
up
with
him
and
moved
up
on
the
side
walk
and
about
that
time,
the
people
who
would
listen
to
walker
moved
in
behind
him
and
followed
with
him,
in
behind
him.
and
then
a
solid
line
formed
across
the
campus
with
the
general
and
these
two
people
in
the
middle.
they
moved
towards
the
lyceum
but
then
i
lost
sight
of
them
as
they
near
the
flagpole
and
about
that
time,
teargas
was
fired.
i
would
also
like
to
comment
briefly
about
justice
stewart's
question.
the
articles
complained
of
in
this
case,
appeared
on
october
2nd
and
3rd.
general
walker's
arrest
was
october
1st.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
about
the
arrest
because
it
was
obviously
irrelevant.
counsel
has
suggested
that
that
the
reporter,
the
associated
press,
before
they
trigger
the
arrest.
mr.
chief
justice
very
properly
points
out,
what
triggered
the
arrest
was
general
walker's
conduct,
not
the
associated
press
reporter's
story.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
think
that's
correct,
at
no
time.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
real
distinction
and
i
think
the
press
is
under
the
gun
in
the
situation
like
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
though
the
upi
reporters
said
the
same
thing
and
gregory
said
the
same
thing,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
press
has
more
of
an
obligation
if
it
has
a
long
time
to
check
the
facts.
in
this
case,
though
the
facts
were
perfectly
clear,
there
was
nothing
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
sir.
i
think
though,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
in
a
situation
of
this
kind,
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
was
there
anything
in
advance
of
the
story
itself
that
would
cause
anyone
to
doubt
that
the
accuracy
of
the
story?
and
here,
everything
that
walker
said
leading
up
to
the
events
suggested
that
the
report
was
accurate.
in
other
words,
there
are
may
be
situations
where
the
charge
is
so
serious.
what's
said
about
the
men
is
so
serious
when
he
about
punitive
check
on
the
accuracy
of
it
that
the
press
has
a
greater
responsibility?
here,
though,
i
think
that
the
events
leading
up
to
the
right
themselves
what
general
walker
said
would
indicate
that
he
fully
intended
to
be
the
leader
of
the
writers.
he
said
as
much
on
the
way
--
on
the
way
to
the
campus.
and
i
think
in
--
just
like
to
enclose
by
saying
that
the
trial
judge
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
ruling
on
malice
as
defined
in
the
new
york
times
case.
justice
brennan
and
justice
white
both
point
that
out.
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
what
the
trial
court
ruled.
in
fact,
it
ruled
very
clearly
that
malice
as
defined
in
new
york
times
was
not
present
in
this
case.
that's
why
i
determined
that
there
is
no
actual
malice
in
the
case.
the
question
that
arises
as
well
as
the
rule
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
should
apply
to
a
public
figure
such
as
plaintiff.
if
it
does,
then
the
entire
jury
verdict
must
be
set
aside
and
judgment
entered
for
the
defendant.
i
don't
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
uh
hum.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
don't
think
it's
--
your
honor,
i
know
this
is
quite
as
clear
as
the
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
means
as
defined
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
says,
that
he
defined
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
taking
--
taking
the
course
of
the
charge
that
you
were
cited
though
on
page
72
and
it's
affirming
that
--
to
that
finding.
and
that
finding
is
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
because
i
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
like
i
think
the
appellate
court
supported
the
trial
court
and
felt
that
the
trial
court
had
ruled
that
new
york
times
malice
was
not
in
the
case
and
therefore
had
no
reason
to
specifically
refer
to
it.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
--
that
is
in
our
reply
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
libel
action
in
which
general
edwin
walker
has
recovered
a
judgment
of
$500,000
against
the
associated
press
for
general
damages.
there
was
no
claim
made
nor
there
was
any
evidence
offered
that
he
suffered
any
actual
damages.
in
addition
to
the
$500,000
general
damage
as
reward,
the
jury
awarded
$300,000
in
punitive
damages.
the
trial
court
set
aside
this
award
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
malice.
the
suit
is
based
on
news
reports
concerning
walker's
activities
in
oxford,
mississippi
during
the
night
of
september
30,
1962,
a
night
when
violence
and
bloodshed
climaxed
in
attempt
by
james
meredith,
a
negro
to
enroll
as
a
student
at
the
university
of
mississippi.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
had
ordered
the
admission
of
mr.
meredith
to
the
then
all-white
university.
but
some
of
the
highest
elected
officials
in
the
state
had
asked
that
they
would
defy
the
order
of
the
federal
court
and
prevent
mr.
meredith's
admission.
the
associated
press
reported
the
events
which
followed.
the
statements
complained
of
in
this
case
were
contained
in
two
news
dispatches
dated
october
2nd
and
3rd
which
originated
with
a
local
associated
press
reporter,
who
was
on
the
campus
at
the
time
of
the
rioting
and
witnessed
the
events
which
he
reported.
those
statements
were:
one,
that
general
walker
assumed
command
of
the
crowd;
and
two,
that
he
led
a
charge
of
students
against
the
federal
marshals
who
were
there
to
see
that
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
was
carried
out.
a
basic
constitutional
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
before
the
document
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
is
to
be
confined
solely
to
public
officials
or
whether
it
should
be
extended
to
persons
like
general
walker,
who
though
not
technically
public
officials,
are
public
figures
or
persons
of
political
prominence
who
have
thrust
themselves
in
the
vortex
of
a
question
of
pressing
public
concern.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
after.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
issue
is
presented
squarely
on
this
appeal.
the
issue
before
the
new
york
times
to
be
extended
because
all
three
texas
courts,
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
courts
quite
properly
found
that
the
statements
were
published
without
any
malice
as
defined
in
the
new
york
times
case.
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution,
the
associated
press
also
claims
that
the
news
reports
were
substantially
true
and
therefore
the
judgment
represents
an
unconstitutional
denial
of
due
process.
that
an
award
of
$500,000
in
general
damages
is
unconstitutionally
oppressive
and
that
the
defense
of
“fair
comment”
as
applied
in
this
case
has
been
unconstitutionally
limited.
this
case,
i
believe,
represents
one
of
the
most
serious
attacks
ever
made
on
the
press
in
this
country.
it
is
but
one
of
the
50
libel
cases
brought
by
general
walker
against
the
associated
press,
its
members
or
both,
arising
out
of
news
reports
identical
or
almost
identical
with
the
one
involved
in
this
litigation.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
suppose
counsel
will.
the
general
has
made
claims
--
i'll
come
to
the
conflict
of
testimony
in
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
the
general
has
made
claims
against
a
significant
portion
of
the
press
asking
for
damages
totaling
more
than
$33
million.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
he's
won
the
two
that
had
been
tried.
now,
the
technique
that
he
uses
is
very
simple
and
effective.
he
is
attempting
to
convert
the
libel
laws
of
this
country
and
the
weapons
of
intimidation,
harassment,
and
punishment.
and
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
up
to
now
he's
been
very
successful.
what
gave
rise
to
the
associated
press'
dispatch
a
theory?
this
court
will
recall
the
many
months
of
legal
proceedings
involving
the
admission
of
james
meredith
to
the
university
of
mississippi.
when
he
had
finally
arrived
at
the
university
to
register
on
september
30th,
as
called
for
by
the
order
of
the
court,
this
circuit.
he
was
accompanied
by
federal
marshals,
who
were
there
to
see
that
the
order
was
complied
with.
that
evening,
when
the
word
got
around
that
meredith
was
in
the
campus,
there
occurred
what
general
walker
has
seemed
fit
to
label
a
protest.
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
violent
attacks
on
the
marshals,
federal
marshals
with
rocks,
sticks,
bricks,
bulldozers,
fire
engines,
and
molotov
cocktails.
one
deputy
marshal
had
a
leg
broken.
one
was
hit
in
the
head.
one
deputy
marshal
was
shot
in
the
back.
the
rioting
left
two
persons
dead
and
more
than
50
injured.
it
was
a
protest
which
brought
the
united
states
into
this
refute
all
over
the
world.
it
was
under
this
scene
that
general
walker
appeared.
it
was
into
this
vortex
that
he
thrusts
himself.
the
general
did
not
come
to
the
scene
unheralded.
he
made
sure
of
that.
over
a
period
of
several
days
with
a
maximum
of
fanfare,
he
announced
his
plans
in
a
series
of
telecasts,
radio
broadcasts,
and
press
conferences
as
he
made
his
way
to
oxford.
for
example
at
shreveport,
louisiana
on
september
26th
in
a
radio
broadcast.
here's
what
he
said,
“rise
to
a
stand
beside
governor
ross
barnett
of
jackson,
mississippi.
now
is
the
time
to
be
heard,
10,000
strong
from
every
state
in
the
union,
rally
to
the
cause
of
freedom,
the
battle
cry
of
the
republic.
barnett,
yes.
castro,
no.
bring
your
flag,
your
tents
and
your
skillets.
it
is
the
time,
now
or
never.
the
time
is
when
and
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
commits
or
uses
any
troops
federal
or
state
in
mississippi.
the
last
time
in
such
a
situation,
in
1957
and
1958
at
little
rock,
i
was
on
the
wrong
side.
this
time
i
will
be
on
the
right
side.
i
will
be
there”.
on
another
day,
a
day
or
two,
another
occasion
a
day
or
two
before
the
riots,
when
he
was
asked
if
he
recommended
that
the
volunteers
go
armed,
general
walker
said,
and
i
quote,
“the
administration
has
indicated
it
will
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
enforce
its
unconstitutional
action.
i
have
stated
that
whatever
is
necessary
to
oppose
that
enforcement
and
stand
behind
governor
barnett,
should
be
done”.
on
the
eve
of
the
riots,
walker
held
a
press
conference
at
oxford
and
announced
that
governor
barnett,
who
by
this
time
has
been
held
in
contempt
by
the
fifth
circuit,
was
being
supported
by
thousands
of
people
beyond
the
borders
of
mississippi,
now
on
their
way
to
join
him
at
oxford.
on
september
30th,
when
president
kennedy,
in
a
national
television
broadcast,
appealed
for
preservation
of
law
and
order,
general
walker
publicly
said,
“nauseating,
nauseating”.
the
evidence
is
clear
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
he
was
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
it
was
a
year
or
two
before
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date,
a
couple
of
years
before
that.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
he
did.
the
evidence
is
clear
and
admitted
that
walker
thrust
himself
into
the
middle
of
this
highly
charged
public
controversy.
not
only
did
he,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
rosenblatt,
thrust
himself
into
the
vortex
of
the
controversy,
but
he
played
a
major
role
in
creating
the
controversy
and
in
giving
leadership
to
those
who
sought
to
obstruct
the
order
of
the
federal
court.
now,
the
general
has
denies
it.
he
would
have
this
court
believe,
notwithstanding
all
the
broadcast,
press
conferences,
which
are
a
matter
of
record
that
he
went
to
the
campus
as
an
observer
or
as
a
spectator.
or
as
he
said
in
his
testimony,
“just
to
see
for
myself
exactly
what
happened”.
of
course,
this
is
an
outrageous
and
offensive
lie.
it
is
perfectly
obvious,
based
on
his
own
words
that
he
did
not
go
to
the
scene
as
a
spectator,
or
an
observer?
he
went
there
as
a
participant
as
an
active
collaborator.
walker
went
to
the
campus
at
oxford
for
the
stated
purpose,
in
his
own
words,
of
preventing
the
order
of
the
federal
court
from
being
carried
out,
as
he
said,
“to
be
on
the
right
side,
this
time”.
he
was
willing
and
anxious
to
do
what
he
could
to
help
that
cause
of
in
a
position
as
he
clearly
demonstrates.
in
fact
on
the
record
--
in
the
record,
he
admits
that
he
asked
the
sheriff
to
be
deputized
so
he
could
help
the
mississippi
authorities.
what
were
his
activities
when
he
arrived
to
the
campus
at
oxford?
well,
he
admits,
he
went
to
scene
of
the
rioting
at
about
8:30,
and
remained
there
on
the
campus
until
about
2
a.m.
he
was
hailed
as
the
leader
of
the
riots
--
rioters.
he
delivered
a
speech
to
the
rioters
although,
he
claimed
at
the
trial
tried
to
calm
the
rioters.
the
fact
is
that
his
speech
was
inflammatory.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
because
i
want
to
show
your
honor
that
he
thrust
himself
into
the
vortex
of
this
controversy
deliberately,
knowingly
for
the
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
but
which
is
all
a
matter
of
record.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
know
that
he
doesn't
deny
any
of
the
things
i
am
saying.
now,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we
do
make
the
argument.
there's
been
a
violation
of
due
process
because
the
evidence
clearly
supports
the
associated
press
insofar
as
the
truth
is
concerned.
but
more
than
that,
we
think
that
the
basic
constitutional
question
is
whether
the
new
york
times
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
cover
people
such
as
general
walker,
who
thrust
themselves
into
the
vortex
of
a
highly
involved
and
inflamed
public
controversy.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
plus
the
due
process
question.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
the
report
made
by
the
associated
press
was
true
and
therefore,
it
was
so
true
that
it
violates
due
process.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
think
there
are
some
cases
there.
but
as
i
said,
i
would
like,
your
honor
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no.
that
--
that
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
because
in
the
--
the
texas
courts
did
not
hold
that
the
new
york
times
rule
extended
to
people
like
general
walker.
they
limited
the
new
york
times
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
i
don't.
we
can
get
that
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we
regard
that
as
a
question
of
law.
the
facts
--
i
think
the
facts
on
his
activities
and
what
he
has
done
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
because
i
didn't
try
the
case
without
a
particular
instruction
was
included
or
not.
i
will
find
out
during
the
recess,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
i
don't
believe
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
i'm
not
sure
that
he
made
a
statement
during
the
trial.
but
the
ruling
of
the
court
was
that
the
new
york
time's
case
did
not
extend
to
anyone
except
public
officials.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it's
been
there
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--
justice
stewart,
in
that
same
opinion
you'll
notice
that
the
trial
court
said
that
the
new
york
times
rule
is
extended
to
persons
of
political
prominence
such
as
walker,
then
there
is
no
case
because
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
malice
in
this
case.
so
the
issue
is
--
was
for
the
new
york
times
rule
was
to
be
extended
to
persons
of
political
prominence
as
directly
for
this
court
in
the
clearest
form.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
it's
appellee
in
texas
--
it's
a
form
of
the
decision
of
the
court
which
is
a
letter
to
counsel,
although
that
was
the
way
he
rendered
his
opinion
in
--
the
trial
court
rendered
its
opinion.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
this
was
tried
in
june
1964.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it
was
--
it
was
just
before
that
march
‘64.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
your
honor
as
i
was
just
concluding
the
point
that
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
when
general
walker
got
to
the
campus
that
night
he
was
the
central
figure
among
the
rioters
because
of
what
he
has
said
before
he
arrived.
now,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
charge
for
the
associated
press
report
that
he
led
the
charge
of
students
against
the
marshals?
well,
the
trial
court
said,
leading
the
charge
means
encouraging
persons
and
the
charge
means
movement
towards
the
marshals.
the
evidence
showed
that
on
at
least
two
occasions
the
general
encouraged
the
crowd
and
moved
towards
the
marshals.
the
marshals
were
in
front
of
the
administration
building,
surrounding
the
administration
building,
protecting
that
building
because
the
crowd
at
that
time
i
think
thought
mr.
meredith
was
in
the
building.
the
rioters
were
on
that
what
is
called
“the
circle”,
an
area
of
about
the
size
of
two
football
fields
next
to
the
administration
building,
there's
a
flagpole
in
the
middle,
and
in
the
other
end
on
the
east
side
it's
the
confederate
monument.
now,
at
the
confederate
monument
the
general
made
his
speech
and
on
several
--
and
at
least
two
occasions
he
moved
in
the
direction
of
the
administration
building
with
people
following
him.
i
would
like
to
just
quote
a
couple
of
comments,
one
from
mr.
john
king,
who
was
the
manager
of
the
local
radio
station.
who
heard
walker
say
to
the
crowd,
“you're
doing
fine.
riot!
you're
getting
news
all
over
the
country.
now
you've
got
casualties”.
a
clear
description
of
what
happened
that
night.
i
think
it's
important
because
this
is
the
description
given
by
one
of
walker's
own
witnesses.
a
man
named
mr.
whit,
who
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
who
was
on
the
campus
at
the
time,
and
who
was
with
walker
during
the
whole
evening.
and
that
two
--
about
two
months
after
the
events,
he
gave
a
statement
to
the
lawyers
of
associated
press,
and
in
the
statement
he
said
these
things
and
it
was
a
signed
statement
by
the
deputy
sheriff,
“after
some
of
the
crowd,
i'd
asked
walker
if
he
would
lead
them.
he
stepped
out
and
sat
at
the
monument
and
said,
keep
protesting
and
see
if
we
could
get
closer”.
and
he
then
started
toward
the
marshals
and
the
crowd
at
least
a
thousand
by
this
time
followed
him.
this
crowd
was
armed
with
sticks,
rocks,
coca-cola
bottles
and
other
things
as
i
heretofore
stated.
they
seem
to
have
anything
they
could
get
their
hands
on.
and
when
they
got
close
enough,
they
would
throw
them
towards
the
marshals.
when
the
front
of
this
crowd,
which
general
walker
was
with,
got
in
about
200
feet
to
the
marshals,
they
fired
another
blast
of
tear
gas
and
the
crowd
ran
back,
with
general
marshal
--
general
walker
with
them.
now
as
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
wasn't
making
that
argument.
i
was
making
the
argument
that
the
ap
dispatches
were
true.
in
just
a
moment,
i
thought
i
would
come
to
the
argument
that
you
referred
to.
i
think
in
this
situation
the
dispatches
by
the
ap
were
actually
true.
but
i
think
furthermore
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
it's
clear
that
under
these
circumstances
where
the
case
was
tried,
as
i
will
point
out
in
louisiana,
a
companion
case
was
tried,
the
jury
there
was
asked
for
in
the
complaint
to
award
the
judgment
of
two
million
and
a
quarter
against
the
associated
press
and
they
brought
it
back
to
verdict
of
$3
million.
so,
it's
pretty
clear
that
in
the
climate
of
today
in
the
civil
rights
field
especially
the
question
of
truth
that
if
it
has
to
be
decided
by
juries
at
this
time,
is
going
to
be
very
inhibiting
as
far
as
first
amendment
constitutional
right
is
concerned,
because
newspapers
and
magazines,
and
television
stations
just
will
not
be
willing
to
risk
judgments
of
this
kind.
will
not
be
willing
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
the
question
of
law
that
you
ask
about
whether
i
think
that
making
a
speech
would
in
itself
suggest
that
he
was
a
man
of
political
prominence
i
think
is
difficult
to
answer.
it
would
depend
on
what
he'd
done
prior
to
the
speech?
what
he
said
in
his
speech?
and
the
nature
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
the
speech.
i
think
there
could
be
no
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
if
you
assume
in
addition
to
what
you
assume
that
all
the
other
things
that
general
walker
has
done
prior
to
the
time
he
made
the
speech,
my
answer
would
be,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
but
i
--
not
at
all,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it's
the
nature
of
his
activities.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--
and
plus
what
he's
done.
for
example
in
this
case,
general
walker
resigned
from
the
army
because
he
said
he
wanted
to
engage
in
political
controversy.
he
was
a
candidate
for
governor
of
texas
just
a
few
months
before
the
events
at
the
university
of
mississippi.
he
was
a
member
of
the
john
birch
society
and
achieved
national
status
with
a
political
following
of
his
own.
his
political
following
is
called
friends
of
walker.
and
paradoxically,
in
the
light
of
--
i
think
that
this
is
interesting
that
he
admitted
that
he
is
paid
to
make
speeches.
and
in
these
speeches,
generally
speaking,
he
maligns
public
officials
with
whom
he
disagrees.
that's
pretty
clear
your
honor
that
the
decisions
of
far-reaching
political
and
social
importance
are
often
significantly
influenced
by
views
and
activities
of
public
men
who
are
not
technically
public
officials.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
answer
those
questions
because
i
would
have
to
know
what
the
student
leaders
have
done.
and
if
didn't
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
well,
i
would
think
then
that
the
--
he
would
--
it
would
cover
him,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
assuming
he'd
done
all
the
things
that
general
walker
has
done.
if
he
had
a
political
following
of
his
own,
if
he
had
made
speeches
all
over
denouncing
the
federal
courts,
if
he
haven't
run
for
political
office
the
fact
he
was
student
leader
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
and
if
he
had
gotten
out
on
the
campus
and
encouraged
the
mob
to
riot
and
applauded
when
he
found
out
that
there
were
casualties,
i
would
say
that
the
new
york
times
rule
should
cover
him.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
do.
i
agree
with
that
and
that
is
what
we
are
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
i
would
if
the
person
was
a
person
of
some
political
prominence
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
can't
imagine
--
i
can't
imagine
the
situation
where
the
court
might
now
want
to
extend
the
rule
quite
that
broadly.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we've
mentioned
it.
we
figured
the
court
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
of
course
it
came
out
after.
i
think
our
--
it
was
decided
after
our
brief
was
prepared,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
time
in
the
hill
case
does
suggest
that
as
well
as
we
indicated
i
think
the
rosenblatt
suggests
that
and
the
garrison
case
suggests
that.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it
was
--
i
think
about
eight
months
before
or
six
months
before
something
like
that.
he
has
been
defeated
by
that
time
but
he'd
been
during
that
that
year.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
would
not
think
in
that
case,
it
would
be
covered
by
the
new
york
times
rule
because
it
would
have
--
new
york
times
rule
is
limited
to
official
conduct
and
i
think
that
if
new
york
times
has
extended
itself
it
will
be,
it
would
have
to
conclude
the
same
ambit
and
that
would
be
public
activities
involving
matters
of
political
controversy.
so
i
would
answer
your
question,
i
would
think
it
would
not
cover
private
activities
of
general
walker.
i
would
like
--
just
in
closing
this
portion
of
my
argument
to
point
out
that
--
that
upholding
it
just
extends
the
new
york
times
rule
to
this
case
will
not
fully
resolve
the
constitutional
issue
of
this
as
we
see
it.
the
threat
inherent
in
the
pendency
of
these
suits
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
threat
inherent
in
the
pendency
of
these
suits,
the
burdens
of
these
lawsuits.
there
are
15
of
them
in
10
states,
as
i
say
asking
for
$33
million
are
themselves
unconstitutionally
inhibiting
because
newspaper
just
can't
afford
to
report
an
events
of
this
kind
if
they're
going
to
be
faced
with
litigation
of
this
type.
for
example,
the
associated
press
now
has
a
bond
of
--
in
louisiana,
over
half
a
million
dollars,
in
the
--
in
texas
i
mean
in
louisiana
case,
we
have
--
because
the
times
(inaudible)
also
sued.
the
bond
required
there
was
$3,375,000.
each
defendant
has
$1,250,000
in
cash
on
deposit.
so
that
here
the
fact
is
that
if
a
man
such
as
general
walker
decides
to
sue
in
areas
where
the
facts
are
going
to
be
decided
by
juries
and
obviously,
you're
very
emotionally
involved
in
the
public
controversy.
then
the
threat
--
then
the
threat
is
so
serious
that
the
press
is
going
to
be
inhibited
in
what
they
report.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
i
do,
justice
harlan.
i
think
that
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
where
a
man
sets
out
to
become
a
political
figure,
who
says
he
resigns
from
the
army
to
engage
in
political
controversy,
is
a
candidate
for
governor,
who
has
a
large
political
following
of
its
own
that
help
to
support
him?
when
he
engages
in
matters
of
this
kind
where
he
attempts
to
obstruct
the
order
of
a
federal
court
being
carried
out
and
the
report,
i
think
in
this
case,
as
i've
said
is
true
but
when
it's
presented
to
a
jury
in
texas
that
tends
to
side
with
the
views
of
general
walker
as
they
brought
in
a
large
verdict.
they
brought
in
that
$300,000
verdict
for
punitive
damages
and
the
court
very
clearly
says
there
was
no
evidence
of
malice.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
may
i
just
say,
i
--
i
would
like
to
urge
that
the
rule
extend
to
that
person.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
i
would
hope
from
the
standpoint
of
the
press
that
the
court
will
see
fit
to
go
that
far.
i
think
there
is
a
considerable
difference
though
in
the
case
that
you
proposed
in
this
case.
and
that
in
this
case,
if
the
associated
press
had
written
about
the
united
states
marshal,
he
would
have
had
no
cause
of
action.
the
associated
press
says
the
same
thing
about
general
walker
who
has
been
a
100
times
more
active
in
the
field
of
civil
rights
than
the
single
united
states
marshal,
then
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
$33
million
and
he's
already
has
two
judgments.
so,
as
far
as
general
walker
is
concerned
in
this
case,
i
think
that
there's
no
doubt
about
it;
that
the
new
york
times
rule
has
to
be
extended
to
cover
him.
i
would
also
hope
that
it
would
be
extended
to
cover
the
case
as
you
cite.
your
honor,
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
i
say,
i
do
after
the
court
extends
the
rule
that
far.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
think
he
may
have.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
one
of
the
reasons
i
hesitate
to
answer
because
in
the
hill
case,
it
wasn't
a
libel
suit.
it
really
was
there
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
civil
rights
statute
in
new
york
and
i
hesitate
to
say
that
the
court
has
because
there
may
be
some
members
that
who
wouldn't
agree
with
me.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
your
honor.
i
hope
that
i
have
not
given
that
impression.
i
think
that
i'm
pitching
my
argument
here
on
the
facts
in
this
case
because
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
rule
that
the
new
york
times
still
extends
to
walker.
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
rule
that
the
issue
of
malice
has
been
determined
and
therefore
is
conclusively
determined
in
the
--
so
that
these
other
15
law
suits
don't
have
to
be
tried.
and
insofar
as
the
rest
of
your
question
is
concerned,
i
think
the
rule
should
be
extended,
not
only
the
person
with
political
prominence
but
to
public
events
that
reported.
and
if
the
type
of
situation
that
you
suggest,
the
persons
is
out
of
the
blow
and
takes
part
in
this
kind
of
an
activity,
thrust
himself
in
the
vortex
of
that
controversy
at
that
time,
the
rule
should
cover
him.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
briefly
to
answer
some
of
the
things
that
been
said
here.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
your
honor,
the
judge
--
it
was
conceded
to
begin
with
in
the
trial
that
he
was
a
public
figure,
that
walk
was
a
public
figure.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
because
--
no,
the
court
ruled
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
did
not
apply
to
a
public
figure
like
walker,
as
he
said
in
his
opinion.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we
--i
think
we
made
the
argument
at
the
new
york
times
doctrine
applied.
i
don't
think
we
asked
the
jury
because
i
it
was
conceded--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
i
say
the
--
i
think
that
the
reason
trial
counsel
didn't
is
because
there
was
a
concession
that
walker
was
a
public
figure
and
it
was
understood
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
rule
that
the
new
york
times
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
people
like
general
walker.
and
that
was
the
opinion
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
he
did
in
his
opinion.
there
was
big
surprise
--
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i'm
not
sure
about
the
timing
of
it
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
suppose
also
that
just
to
speak
about
counsel
who
tried
the
case.
i
suppose
that
that's
the
time
he
felt
that
it
was
a
matter
of
law
and
so
he
didn't
asked
for
the
instruction.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
would,
if
i
may
--
i'd
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised.
first,
in
answer
to
judge
fortas'
question,
the
letter
opinion
is
an
opinion
of
the
court
and
it
was
filed
in
the
court
and
i
just
checked
on
mr.
guyton
in
texas
and
he
said
that
is
the
--
a
traditional
way,
customary
way
of
filing
opinion
of
the
court.
secondly,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
chief
justice's
questions
of
mr.
watts
about
a
deputy
sheriff
whit.
and
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
he
had
testified
about
that
statement?
now,
the
statement
was
taken
about
two
months
after
the
events.
each
page
was
signed
by
the
deputy
marshal
--
deputy
sheriff,
his
name
is
whit.
and
when
he
testified
for
general
walker,
he
was
asked
these
questions
and
they
appear
on
page
280.
“i
hand
you
what
purports
to
be
a
statement.”
“yes,
sir”.
“is
that
your
signature
on
each
page?”
“that's
my
signature;
that's
my
statement”.
“did
you
make
this
statement?”
“i
did.”
“did
you,
in
making
that
statement
tell
the
truth
as
you
knew
it
at
that
time?”
“the
best
i
knew
how.”
“do
you
think
at
that
time
you
made
the
statement
if
the
matters
you
now
put
in
that
statement
were
true
and
the
best
of
your
knowledge
and
belief?”
“well,
i
told
it
the
best
i
could
think
of
it
then”.
in
addition
to
that
statement,
there
is
that
story
written
by
mr.
gregory
of
the
merit,
a
merit
in
a
newspaper,
which
is
a
local
newspaper
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
it
points
out
that
walker
led
a
charge
against
the
marshals.
and
it
points
out
the
good
many
other
things
that
were
said
in
the
ap
story.
in
addition
to
that,
the
upi
reporter
who
has
said
testified,
and
he
testified
at
page
963
in
the
record,
and
here's
what
the
upi
reporter
said,
“after
the
speech,
walker
stood
there
for
a
short
time.
he's
talking
about
the
speech
he
made
at
the
monument.
then
he
turned
to
his
left
and
sat
down
to
the
monument
to
face
the
lyceum.
that's
the
administration
building.
it
took
several
steps
up
to
walk
and
then
when
the
two
men
caught
up
with
him
and
moved
up
on
the
side
walk
and
about
that
time,
the
people
who
would
listen
to
walker
moved
in
behind
him
and
followed
with
him,
in
behind
him.
and
then
a
solid
line
formed
across
the
campus
with
the
general
and
these
two
people
in
the
middle.
they
moved
towards
the
lyceum
but
then
i
lost
sight
of
them
as
they
near
the
flagpole
and
about
that
time,
teargas
was
fired.
i
would
also
like
to
comment
briefly
about
justice
stewart's
question.
the
articles
complained
of
in
this
case,
appeared
on
october
2nd
and
3rd.
general
walker's
arrest
was
october
1st.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
about
the
arrest
because
it
was
obviously
irrelevant.
counsel
has
suggested
that
that
the
reporter,
the
associated
press,
before
they
trigger
the
arrest.
mr.
chief
justice
very
properly
points
out,
what
triggered
the
arrest
was
general
walker's
conduct,
not
the
associated
press
reporter's
story.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
think
that's
correct,
at
no
time.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
real
distinction
and
i
think
the
press
is
under
the
gun
in
the
situation
like
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
though
the
upi
reporters
said
the
same
thing
and
gregory
said
the
same
thing,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
press
has
more
of
an
obligation
if
it
has
a
long
time
to
check
the
facts.
in
this
case,
though
the
facts
were
perfectly
clear,
there
was
nothing
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
sir.
i
think
though,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
in
a
situation
of
this
kind,
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
was
there
anything
in
advance
of
the
story
itself
that
would
cause
anyone
to
doubt
that
the
accuracy
of
the
story?
and
here,
everything
that
walker
said
leading
up
to
the
events
suggested
that
the
report
was
accurate.
in
other
words,
there
are
may
be
situations
where
the
charge
is
so
serious.
what's
said
about
the
men
is
so
serious
when
he
about
punitive
check
on
the
accuracy
of
it
that
the
press
has
a
greater
responsibility?
here,
though,
i
think
that
the
events
leading
up
to
the
right
themselves
what
general
walker
said
would
indicate
that
he
fully
intended
to
be
the
leader
of
the
writers.
he
said
as
much
on
the
way
--
on
the
way
to
the
campus.
and
i
think
in
--
just
like
to
enclose
by
saying
that
the
trial
judge
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
ruling
on
malice
as
defined
in
the
new
york
times
case.
justice
brennan
and
justice
white
both
point
that
out.
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
what
the
trial
court
ruled.
in
fact,
it
ruled
very
clearly
that
malice
as
defined
in
new
york
times
was
not
present
in
this
case.
that's
why
i
determined
that
there
is
no
actual
malice
in
the
case.
the
question
that
arises
as
well
as
the
rule
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
should
apply
to
a
public
figure
such
as
plaintiff.
if
it
does,
then
the
entire
jury
verdict
must
be
set
aside
and
judgment
entered
for
the
defendant.
i
don't
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
uh
hum.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
don't
think
it's
--
your
honor,
i
know
this
is
quite
as
clear
as
the
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
means
as
defined
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
says,
that
he
defined
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
taking
--
taking
the
course
of
the
charge
that
you
were
cited
though
on
page
72
and
it's
affirming
that
--
to
that
finding.
and
that
finding
is
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
because
i
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
like
i
think
the
appellate
court
supported
the
trial
court
and
felt
that
the
trial
court
had
ruled
that
new
york
times
malice
was
not
in
the
case
and
therefore
had
no
reason
to
specifically
refer
to
it.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
--
that
is
in
our
reply
brief,
your
honor.
