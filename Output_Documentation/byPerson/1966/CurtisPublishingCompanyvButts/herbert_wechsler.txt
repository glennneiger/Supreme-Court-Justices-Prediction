mr.
herbert
wechsler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
raises
another
variant
question
of
the
scope
of
the
rule
declared
by
the
decision
in
the
new
york
times
company
v.
sullivan.
this
was
a
libel
action
instituted
in
the
northern
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
by
the
respondent
claiming
$5
million
punitive
and
$5
million
general
damages
for
an
article
which
appeared
in
the
side
the
evening
posts
of
march
23,
1963.
that
article
entitled,
“the
story
of
a
college
football
fix”
and
subtitled,
“a
shocking
report
of
how
wally
butts
and
‘bear'
bryant
rigged
the
game
last
fall”,
purported
to
tell
a
story
of
one
george
burnett,
an
insurance
salesman
in
atlanta
who
claimed
to
have
been
accidentally,
cut
in
on
a
telephone
call
from
atlanta
to
test
the
loser,
cut
in
while
he
was
making
local
call.
and
thus,
to
have
overhead
the
conversation
between
mr.
butts,
who
was
then
the
athletic
director
of
the
university
of
georgia,
former
football
coach
and
paul
bryant,
who
was
then
as
he,
of
course,
he's
now
the
head
coach
of
the
university
of
alabama
football
team
and
the
athletic
director.
the
article
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
mr.
butts
had
ceased
to
be
the
coach
some
18
months
before
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
and
was
now
the
athletic
director
of
the
university.
mr.
bryant,
of
course,
was
the
coach
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
alabama
team.
the
article
in
no
uncertain
terms
reported
burnett's
statement
that
he
had
overheard
bryant,
butts
i
mean,
responding
to
bryant's
question,
“have
you
got
anything
for
me
wally?”
could
proceed
to
give
him
in
detail
statements
about
the
georgia
players'
formations
and
place
which
he
inferred
was
information
that
butts
was
giving
him
about
what
georgia
was
going
to
do
in
the
forthcoming
opening
game
of
the
1962
season
which
was
scheduled
to
take
place
some
nine
days
thereafter.
the
telephone
call
that
burnett
claimed
to
have
heard
was
on
september
13,
1962
and
the
game
between
alabama
and
georgia
was
to
be
paid
--
played
on
september
22nd.
at
the
end
of
this
conversation
or
in
the
course
of
this
conversation
i
suppose
recorded.
bryant
would
ask
butts
specific
questions
and
butts
would
answer,
“i
don't
know”.
and
bryant
would
say,
“can
you
find
out
for
me?”
and
butts
would
say,
“i'll
try.”
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
conversation,
bryant
asked
butts,
if
he
would
be
home
on
sunday.
and
butts
said
that,
he
would.
the
importance
of
that
last
statement
being
that
it
was
proved
by
records
of
the
telephone
company
that
a
september
13th
call
did
take
place
from
bryant
at
the
office
in
atlanta,
georgia.
that
burnett
had
been
trying
to
get
on
the
phone
to
the
alabama
or
athletic
office
in
tuscaloosa.
that
--
and
secondly,
that
on
the
following
sunday,
there
had
been
a
telephone
call
of
over
an
hour
duration
from
tuscaloosa
placed
by
bryant
and
charged
to
his
credit
card
to
wallace
butts
at
his
home
in
athens,
georgia.
now,
they
say
again
the
publication
on
the
basis
of
burnett's
story
charged
and
they
editors
of
the
post
affirmed
the
charged
in
an
accompanying
editorial
statement
that
butts
and
bryant
had
fixed
or
rigged
this
game
by
butts
giving
bryant
confidential
information
about
the
georgia
plays.
the
case
in
the
district
court
proceeded.
suit
was
filed
almost
immediately
after
the
publication.
case
proceeded
on
the
defendant's
plea
of
truth
and
that
was
apart
from
inconsequential
denials.
that
was
the
issue
in
the
trial
of
this
case
below
the
trial
court
charge
in
the
conventional
libel
terms
that
the
burden
of
proving
truth
was
on
the
defendant.
proof
--
truth
of
the
--
what
the
court
called
the
“sting
of
the
libel”,
viewing
the
sting
of
the
libel
as
a
charge
that
butts
had
given
bryant
information
calculated
to
influence
the
result
of
the
game
either
to
influence
to
won
or
lost
or
to
influence
the
score
by
which
the
game
was
brought.
i
think
the
judges'
words
were
calculated
or
likely
to
influence
the
result
of
the
game.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
there
was,
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that's
not
here.
bryant
brought
suit
in
alabama
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
shortly
after.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
suit
was
brought
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
tried,
verdict
before
new
york
times.
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
verdict,
i
might
say,
was
$60,000
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
what
new
york
times
decision
before
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
time.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
sir.
it
was
pending.
it
was
pending
in
this
court
actually
at
that
time.
the
verdict
as
i
say
was
$60,000,
general
damages;
$3
million,
punitive
damages.
and
on
motion
for
new
trial
addressed
to
the
verdict,
the
district
court
reduced
the
$3
million
punitive
damages
to
$400,000
on
remittitur
which
the
plaintiff
filed
so
that
the
verdict
entered
against
curtis
is
a
verdict
for
$460,000.
now,
i
say
the
case
presents
a
variant
of
the
new
york
times
problem
but
i
must
deal
first
with
the
question,
whether
that
issue
is
in
the
case.
the
point
was
raised
immediately
after
the
new
york
times
decision
by
curtis
on
motion
for
new
trial
filed
under
rule
60
(b).
this
actually
was
a
second
motion,
60
(b)
motion
that
curtis
filed.
the
first
one
being
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
district
court
ruled
on
that
motion
on
the
merits
and
held
that
new
york
times
did
not
apply
on
the
ground
that
the
athletic
director
was
the
employee
of
the
athletic
association
and
thus,
not
within
--
not
an
official
within
the
ambit
of
the
times
rule.
i'll
come
to
that,
of
course,
in
a
moment.
on
appeal,
however,
the
majority
of
the
fifth
circuit
of
the
court
below
did
not
pass
on
that
submission
but
rather
held
that
curtis
had
waived
the
new
york
times
point,
if
it
has
that
point,
by
not
raising
it
earlier
than
the
60
(b)
motion.
and
in
reaching
its
conclusion
as
to
waiver,
the
court
gave
weight
to
the
fact
that
among
the
counsel
for
curtis
in
the
georgia
case
or
the
counsel
cooperating
in
the
georgia
case,
were
alabama
counsel
who
had
also
been
counsel
for
the
times
in
alabama.
the
embry-beddow
firm
so
that
these
lawyers
knew
of
the
submissions
that
were
--
had
been
made
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
the
argument
of
times.
here,
on
that
ground
it
was
concluded
by
the
majority
below
that
there
is
an
actual
waiver
of
any
right
to
invoke
the
benefit
of
the
times
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
when
was
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
was
just
--
i
can
give
you
the
date
of
the
notice
of
appeal
and
also
that
was
january
24,
1964
and
the
60
(b)
motion
was
february
28,
1964,
the
first
60
(b)
motion.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
second
motion
was
the
amended
60
(b)
motion
invoking
sullivan
was
march
23,
1964.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
march
9,
1964.
the
case
was
argued
incidentally,
mr.
justice
fortas,
january
6,
1964,
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
granted
the
previous
january
of
1963.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no
constitutional
claim
was
made
in
the
trial
itself.
there
was
no
request
for
an
instruction
that
would
raise
comparable
points.
the
first
constitutional
claim
asserted
by
the
defendants
of
anybody
in
this
lawsuit
was
on
the
first
motion
for
new
trial
attacking
the
verdict.
there,
the
$3
million
verdict
was
attacked
on
first
amendment
grounds
and
quite
independently
of
sullivan
before
sullivan.
and
that
point,
i
think
it's
perfectly
claimed
as
judge
rives
very
strongly
emphasized
below
is
in
this
case
beyond
the
doubt.
i
mean,
if
it
is
a
point
that
there
are
constitutional
objections
to
the
magnitude
of
the
verdict
part
for
any
issue
privilege
as
to
publication.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
see
now
i'm
put
to
answer
that.
i
certainly
did
not
explicitly
urge
that
liability
be
maintained,
defended
sustained,
conditioned
on
a
privilege
defined
and
the
terms
that
the
court
find
the
privilege
in
sullivan.
there
is
a
part
of
the
argument,
however,
which
was
that
if
our
claim
for
total
immunity
was
not
sustained
that
some
accommodation
of
the
interest
in
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
and
certainly
in
the
oral
argument
that
was
true.
and
on
the
brief,
there
is
a
section
as
i
recall
but
the
--
i
certainly
would
not
submit
that
anybody
reading
our
brief
in
new
york
times
would
perceived
in
it
the
opinion
and
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case.
and
yet,
the
suggestion
below
really
is
that
anybody
who
is
familiar
with
the
petition
for
certiorari
ought
to
have
been
aware
of
what
was
going
to
happen
here
when
the
new
york
times
case
was
argued
properly.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yeah.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
right.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
and
--
and
i
don't
gamble
about
that.
the
simple
fact
in
this
lawsuit
was
that
the
trial
counsel
representing
curtis,
believing
in
their
plea
of
truth,
did
not
consider
that
the
existing
law
gave
them
any
claim
of
constitutional
privilege
and
they
will
not
dispose
to
do
any
legal
experimentation
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
that
is
the
honest
and
candid
fact
to
the
matter
and
that
the
result
of
it
is
that
we're
out
to
fail
--
for
failure
to
anticipate
the
times
ruling
then
we're
out.
but
i
submit
that
is
not
the
law
and
that
the
decision
of
this
court
made
perfectly
plain
that
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
a
change
in
law
whether
it
would
be
statutory
or
constitutional
or
decisional,
whether
it
be
state
law
or
federal
law,
may
be
invoked
on
direct
attack
on
appeal,
and
we
do
invoke
it
that
this
court
has
imposed
that
rule
on
the
state
under
the
supremacy
clause.
i
should
suppose
it
would
be
quite
plainly
imposed
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
pardon,
sir?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no.
i
consider
the
question
--
i
can
certainly
consider
the
question
of
law
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
unless
the
--
unless
there
is
contrariety
in
evidence
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
individuals
to
the
nature
of
what
he
does
or
--
but
i
consider
that
the
issue
whether
the
privilege
applies
is
an
issue
of
law
and
indeed
an
issue
of
constitutional
law.
indeed,
but
i
may
pass
beyond
the
waiver
point
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
on
which
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
only
two
judges
below
have
passed
judge
morgan,
the
district
court,
who
ruled
against
us
on
the
merits
and
judge
rives
dissenting
in
the
fifth
circuit
who
ruled
with
us
on
the
merits
in
the
view
that
new
york
times
should
be
deemed
to
apply.
now
passing
to
the
merits,
i
should
first
state
what
the
facts
are
that
bear
upon
the
issue
as
athletic
director.
the
record
shows
that
butts
was
in
general
charged
of
the
athletic
program
of
the
university
of
georgia,
subject
as
to
policy
direction
to
this
athletic
board.
well,
if
athletic
association
nominally
board
in
conventional
lingo
which
in
turn
was
responsible
to
the
president,
chancellor
and
regents.
it
was
a
corporation
introduced
into
the
atlantic
management
picture
on
a
pattern
that
many
universities
have
adopted.
the
main
motivation
for
it
being
that
it
freeze
contracting
from
state
audit
and
other
red
tape
limitations
that
stand
in
the
way
of
the
operation
of
college
athletics
on
the
big
time
business
basis
college
athletics
now
to
proceed.
i
say
again
as
to
butts'
position,
he
was
appointed
by
this
association,
fitting
into
the
picture
of
university
management.
in
the
way
that
it
did,
he
was
paid
by
the
association
with
slight
addendum
out
of
university
funds
that
i
take
it
that
had
something
to
do
with
preparing
a
way
for
getting
in
the
pension.
of
course
georgia
was
a
state
university,
the
regents
are
regarded
and
treated
explicitly
declared
to
be
a
department
of
the
state
government,
the
chancellor
and
president
or
indubitably
state
officials
and
the
athletic
association
has
a
majority
of
faculty
on
it
who
are
chosen
by
the
president
of
the
university,
complying
thereby
incidentally
with
the
standard
of
the
athletic
association
and
particularly
of
the
southeastern
conference
of
which
--
which
georgia
is
a
member.
now,
we
say
quite
simply
that
running
the
athletic
operation
of
a
state
university
puts
a
pressure
in
a
position
where
criticism
of
his
official
conduct
ought
to
be
considered
within
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
and
therefore,
within
the
scope
of
the
new
york
times
privilege.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
and
a
comment
related
to
its
quarterbacking?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
--
i
think
it
would
distort
the
concept
to
regard
the
quarterback
as
an
official
obviously.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
oh!
i
put
it
--
i
say
it
would
distort
the
concept
of
public
officials
but
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
but
i
wish
to
reserve
very
strongly
the
proposition,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
new
york
times
rule
is
not
to
be
envisaged
as
a
limited
ru
--
a
rule
limited
to
situations
in
which
the
complainant
is
a
“public
official”
within
a
characterization
would
be
given
to
the
context
of
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
any
absolute
immunity
doctrine
at
all.
i
completely
accept
as
i
must
the
conclusion
of
the
court
in
sullivan
that
to
the
extent
that
the
constitution
imposes
limitations
on
state
imposition
of
liability
for
libel.
the
limitation
that
it
imposes
is
a
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
proved
that
the
statement
was
false
and
it
was
uttered
by
the
defendant
with
knowledge
of
its
falsity
or
with
recklessness
as
to
whether
it
was
true
or
false.
that
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
--
may
i
give
you
a
somewhat
extended
answer
to
that
because
it's
the
heart
of
the
case.
i
say
that
the
mode
of
analysis
is
the
one
foreshadowed
in
the
court's
delineated
and
foreshadowed
in
the
court's
opinion
in
times.
that
the
first
question
to
be
faced
is
a
question
whether
the
publication,
whether
the
utterance,
is
an
utterance
with
which
freedom
to
publish
which
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
with
which
is
our
concern
to
the
first
amendment,
to
the
purposes
of
the
first
amendment.
i
come
back
to
what
you
said
in
the
argument
of
--
in
question,
the
150
you
remind
counsel
what
you
--
was
starting
with
the
first
amendment
and
that's
where
i
started.
and
now,
i
don't
mean
to
depreciate
the
difficulty
and
the
problems
this
court
must
face
in
deciding
whether
or
not
utterances,
expression
to
the
particular
kind
are
or
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
protection
that
the
first
amendment
as
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
confers.
this
is
an
area
that
can
be
an
area
of
enormous
difficulty.
it
has
been
--
it's
relatively
young
and
the
jurisprudences
of
the
court
being
only
40
years
old
or
so.
but
given
that
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
must
be
answered
as
a
legal
question
that
because
of
the
subject
matter
of
this
publication,
freedom
to
speak
published
is
within
the
scope
of
what
the
first
amendment
is
about.
now,
if
the
answer
is
favorable
to
that
it
is
within
the
scope
of
what
the
first
amendment
is
about.
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
considerations
that
led
the
court
in
times
to
conclude
that
strict
liability
is
offensive
to
the
constitutional
guarantee
that
some
amelioration
of
strict
liabilities
be
at
the
statutory
liabilities
of
the
sought
that
had
been
imposed
in
many
different
areas
or
be
at
the
120-year-old
rule
in
libel
that
imposes
strict
liability.
that
such
strict
liability
is
because
of
their
inevitable
effect
on
people
who
would
publish
must
be
mollified
and
the
principle
of
mollification,
the
limitation
of
liability
to
knowing
reckless
falsehood
seems
to
me
precisely
responsive
to
the
conflicting
values
that
are
involved.
as
i
said
in
my
brief,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
rule
is
in
itself
an
accommodation
of
whatever
public
interest
is
being
involved
to
justify
the
liability
or
suppression
on
the
one
hand
and
the
claim
of
freedom
on
the
other.
now,
it's
less
clear
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
is
at
all
concerned
with
the
gossip
columns
about
who
slept
with
whom
in
what
hotel
room
three
nights
previously.
and
well,
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
court
may
have
to
face
claims
of
privilege
for
such
publications
on
first
amendment
grounds.
if
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
conclusion
reached
that
the
first
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
type
of
publications.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
would
be
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
i
would
be
the
last
to
wish
to
impose
limitations
on
human
curiosity
and
i
think
that
in
taking
that
view,
i
speak
in
the
constitutional
provision.
first
amendment
was
concerned
with
the
nurturing
of
the
human
mind
by
discourse
and
communication.
but
coming
back
to
your
concrete
case
about
the
football
player,
who
betrays
the
team,
i
should
think
given
the
many
years
that
it
seems
to
obtain
nationally
about
the
subject
of
football
and
the
loyalties
that
are
involved
and
the
place
of
athletics
in
university
programs.
all
of
which
we've
allude
to
in
the
brief
with
the
best
materials
we
could
find,
argue
for
the
privilege
in
that
situation.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
sir.
now,
i
should
have
--
i
should
say,
of
course,
that
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
we
should
prevail
on
narrower
grounds
and
that
the
decision
in
rosenblatt
is
indistinguishable
in
any
principle
sense
from
the
decision
we
ask
for
here.
there
you
had
a
director
of
skiing
area.
here,
you
have
a
director
of
athletics
of
a
state
university
and
realize
that
rosenblatt
didn't
--
wasn't
an
ultimate
holding
for
the
plaintiff
but
it
did
send
the
case
back.
and
the
only
theory
on
which
we
say
that
went
fact
is
that
if
rosenblatt
established
that
he
was
in
charge
of
the
area
that
then
it
had
to
face
the
charge
privilege.
now,
i
know
i
should
also
have
said,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
answer
to
your
--
final
answer
to
your
question
that
i
do
very
strongly
rely
on
time
against
hill
--
on
the
decision
on
time
against
hill
and
supporting
the
general
thesis
that
i
advanced.
although,
i
realized
the
reservations
in
the
court's
opinion
there
that
issued
in
this
case
and
others
like
it,
deliberately
and
specifically
left
open.
i
nevertheless
suggest
that
the
very,
very
consideration
that
led
the
court
deeming
that
publication
to
be
within
the
realm
of
first
amendment
protection
to
be
something
that
the
first
amendment
was
concerned
about.
telling
people
about
the
new
play
that
or
relationship
to
an
actual
episode
in
human
life,
a
very
logic
that
led
the
court
then
to
precede
the
necessity
for
new
york
times
kind
of
privilege
and
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
repeatedly
reply
in
any
situation
whether
is
that
type
of
public
interest
in
the
publication.
and
i
would
have
as
a
final
thought
that
this
doesn't
set
the
law
quite
as
far
adrift
as
it
might
seem
to
because
the
issue
is
very
close
to
the
issue
that
state
courts
have
confronted
under
the
fair
comment
defense
in
asking
the
question,
whether
this
is
a
matter
to
which
the
privilege
of
fair
comment
applies
so
that
there
is
a
body
of
law,
a
body
of
thinking,
judicial
thinking
that
will
be
relevant
in
working
out
this
subject
in
closed
cases.
for
example,
we
have
a
fair
comment
case
in
new
york
that's
cited
in
the
brief
that
involved
a
high
school
football
coach
and
the
court
just
--
and
no
doubt
that
the
communities
entrust
in
the
performing
to
that
high
school
football
coach
was
something
that
could
be
published
about.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
conventional
limitation
on
the
fair
comment
rule
that
limits
its
availability
to
facts
accurately
states
it's
that
it
adds
nothing
to
the
plead
of
truth
really,
does
not
comport
--
cannot
comport
with
the
policies
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
you're
quite
right
about
it
but
the
--
any
judgmental
statement
like
betrayal
would
i
think
potentially
be
within
the
fair
comment
rule,
except
that
the
rule
is
generally
limited
to
comment
on
facts
truthfully
stated.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
so
that
unless
you
couple
it
with
a
plea
of
truth
as
to
the
factual
statement,
it
avails
nothing
and
if
you
have
got
a
plea
of
truth
as
to
the
factual
statements,
you
don't
need
it.
that's
i
think
the
essence
of
still
courts
have
confronted
the
question,
what
is
the
legitimate
subject
of
fair
comment?
and
it's
that
body
of
judge
made
law
that
i
point
to
us
helping
you
guide
judgment
in
the
development
of
this
first
amendment
clause.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
that's
certainly
a
reasonable
distinction.
but
i
would
suggest
this,
mr.
justice,
even
in
the
operation
of
magazine
publication.
there
comes
a
point
where
judgment
has
to
be
made.
that
the
story
has
been
adequately
investigated
to
satisfy
the
publishers
that
it
should
be
published.
and
how
far
it
is
prudent?
given
the
first
amendment
interest
and
the
weight
of
that
interest,
how
far
it
is
prudent
to
so
cast
the
scope
for
the
privilege
than
any
jury
second
guesses
that
invited
the
second
guess
to
every
publisher
as
to
whether
the
investigation
was
adequate
or
not,
that's
a
question
that
would
give
me
some
pause.
and
i
think
the
great
virtue
of
the
new
york
times
privilege
as
defined
in
that
opinion
is
that
it
faces
the
question
as
essentially
question
in
good
faith
of
the
publisher.
now
normally,
publishers
functioning
in
good
faith
had
no
interest
or
motive
to
publish
false.
and
it
certainly
it
hasn't
been
established
i
think
either
that
the
history
of
strict
liability
has
done
a
great
deal
for
reputation
or
that
the
standards
of
the
american
press
to
have
modified
in
dealing
with
public
fig
--
officials
since
the
decision
in
new
york
times.
i
think
press
is
functioning
as
it
has
before
and
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
i
think
it
had.
and
i
think
it
is
been
controlled
in
the
suppression
of
truth.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
i
do
indeed
think
it
has.
as
matter
of
fact,
if
i
may
say
a
word
in
closing,
i
invite
attention
to
this
bracket
as
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
problems
that
confront
a
publisher
if
he
must
show
in
a
plea
of
truth,
liability
established
truth,
assume
the
burden
of
proving
truth
or
else
face
liability.
if
you
study
this
charge,
i
think
you
find
for
example
that,
if
the
jury
is
unpersuaded
then
our
statement
was
true.
then
--
and
then
face
off
to
the
punitive
damage
question,
face
off
to
the
malice
question,
they
face
off
to
it
on
the
theory
that
the
publication
was
false.
well,
obviously,
we
know
our
top
people
testified
that
we
know
that
this
publication
hurt
butts.
how
could
you
publish
a
thing
like
this
and
not
expect
you
to
hurt
the
subject
of
it?
we
publish
it
because
we
believe
it
was
true.
well,
here's
a
built
in
case
of
malice.
now,
the
position
of
the
jury
may
well
have
been
that
it
was
uncertain
whether
this
was
true
or
not.
it
could
have
been
uncertain
about
the
telephone
calls.
it's
conceivable
to
made
any
--
it
could
have
been
uncertain
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
whether
burnett
really
hurt
this
or
whether
his
notes
which
are
in
the
record
and
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
them.
these
are
the
notes
that
were
in
evidence
at
page
1075
of
the
record.
do
these
notes
indicate
that
important
information
was
conveyed
or
not?
well,
there
were
six
football
coaches
who
testified,
four
of
them
testified.
they
thought
this
information
was
helpful
to
an
opposing
coach.
two
georgia
assistant
coaches
said,
“no,
there's
nothing
here
that
would
help
anybody.
mr.
schroder
was
a
great
football
player,
took
everybody
to
the
traces
on
what
these
various
formations
are.
my
life
was
spent
on
happily
on
the
law
library
and
i
can't
say
that
i
am
able
to
follow
even
after
a
careful
study,
these
explanations
in
the
record.
but
when
i
read
that
two
of
the
coaches
say
that
this
contained
the
main
formations
that
georgia
used
in
the
game
and
plan
to
use,
i
can
think
that
this
is
hardly
a
fabrication
and
when
i
read
at
the
end
that
bryant
was
going
to
call
butts
on
sunday
and
then
find
on
the
record
that
following
sunday
he
did
call
him
and
all
that
came
out
only
after
the
university
investigation
of
this
whole
matter
had
begun
then
i
am
able
to
view
what
is
even
a
possibility
that
this
thing
was
a
fabrication.
but
did
the
jury
--
was
the
jury
uncertain
whether
the
information
really
helped
bryant,
the
great
coach?
it
may
have
helped
him
only
by
telling
him
that
it
was
nothing
new
that
he
knew
nothing,
didn't
know.
but
it
would
be
enough
to
explain
the
jury
verdict
that
contrary
opinions
as
to
whether
the
information
helped
bryant
or
not,
left
them
on
a
state
of
uncertainty.
and
then
on
the
malice
charge,
i
don't
see
how
they
can
escape
finding
malice
if
they
must
approach
that
on
the
assumption
that
the
statements
were
false.
may
i
reserve
my
few
minutes?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
answer
in
the
brief
time.
mr.
justice
fortas,
on
your
question
about
the
alabama
public
man
statute,
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
50
of
the
petitioner's
briefs
--
brief
on
the
merits
wherein
the
footnote
12
the
authorities
have
brought
together
that
indicate
plainly
that
there
was
no
defense
of
good
faith
under
the
public
man
section
of
the
alabama
statute
and
it's
quite
indefensible
really
to
put
to
the
court
that
there
is
if
further
we
claim,
we
settle
by
the
cases
cited
in
the
last
paragraph
of
our
footnote
that
the
privilege
adds
nothing
to
the
plea
of
truth.
you
got
to
be
right
on
your
facts.
the
--
if
you
look
at
page
36
of
the
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits,
you'll
see
that
all
they
have
to
say
against
this
is
that
in
georgia,
the
earlier
of
conflicting
authorities
governed.
well,
you
know
there
is
that
special
doctrine
in
georgia
but
i
will
simply
say
that
it
has
no
application
here
because
these
are
high
court
cases,
supreme
court
cases,
and
there
the
latest
authoritative
case
would
govern.so
that's
absolutely
out.
the
second
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
reference
was
made
to
mr.
strubing
that
was
here
in
his
participation
in
this
litigation.
his
affidavit
is
at
page
1340
of
the
record
and
where
he
makes
clear
that
there
was
no
deliberate
intention
to
surrender
any
rights
of
the
post
in
this
pleading
business
but
as
i
said,
in
my
argument
i
don't
regard
that
as
major,
any
how.
now
coming
to
the
facts
which
i
cannot
and
unhappily
review
in
a
minute
and
a
half,
may
i
at
least
direct
the
court's
attention
to
two
points?
first,
even
if
mr.
schroder
was
right
and
this
was
a
clearer
cases
of
recklessness
as
he
thinks
it
is,
he
says
it
is,
i
submit
that
we've
been
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
on
it
under
a
right
of
a
basic
point,
under
a
malice
--
proper
malice
instruction
as
the
court
held
in
rosenblatt
and
other
cases
that
will
reversed
without
ruling,
and
indeed
in
time
against
hill.
i
can't
believe
that
mr.
schroder
remains
to
argue
that
there
wasn't
a
jury
question
here
on
malice.
but
if
he
does
mean
to
argue
that,
then
i
must
direct
attention
to
the
summary
on
pages
68
and
9
of
our
brief
which
indicates
that
we
do
not
concur
in
his
reading
of
the
record.
for
example,
he
said
that
notes
were
available.
the
notes
were
not
available
at
the
time
when
the
post,
the
representatives
were
in
touch
with
burnett.
why
weren't
they?
because
they'd
been
turned
over
to
the
university
authorities
by
burnett
when
he
reported
this
on
january
4th,
the
notes
were
in
the
hands
of
mr.
cook
bowwick,
the
counsel
with
the
athletic
board
and
the
whole
matter
was
being
investigated
by
the
university
authorities.
now,
he
says,
“if
we
only
have
the
notes.
then
we
would
have
known
why.”
well,
obviously
from
our
point
of
view,
we
had
the
notes
who
would
have
confirmed
our
view
that
this
conversation
occurred
and
that
butts
did
give
bryant
this
information.
that
is
the
way
we
read
the
notes.
that
is
the
way
they
will
read
by
chief
coach
griffith,
on
the
night
when
they
were
turned
over
to
him.
that
is
the
way
they
were
read
by
the
georgia
university
authorities.
we
knew
also
that
butts
have
resigned
precipitately
which
didn't
exactly
seem
to
be
the
action
of
an
innocent
man.
we
knew
further
that
the
matter
was
taken
with
the
greatest
seriousness
by
the
university
authorities
and
by
the
state.
now,
all
those
things
were
known
that
i
say,
i
must
close
by
the
referring
to
the
summary
of
this
material
at
pages
68
the
following
our
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
raises
another
variant
question
of
the
scope
of
the
rule
declared
by
the
decision
in
the
new
york
times
company
v.
sullivan.
this
was
a
libel
action
instituted
in
the
northern
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
by
the
respondent
claiming
$5
million
punitive
and
$5
million
general
damages
for
an
article
which
appeared
in
the
side
the
evening
posts
of
march
23,
1963.
that
article
entitled,
“the
story
of
a
college
football
fix”
and
subtitled,
“a
shocking
report
of
how
wally
butts
and
‘bear'
bryant
rigged
the
game
last
fall”,
purported
to
tell
a
story
of
one
george
burnett,
an
insurance
salesman
in
atlanta
who
claimed
to
have
been
accidentally,
cut
in
on
a
telephone
call
from
atlanta
to
test
the
loser,
cut
in
while
he
was
making
local
call.
and
thus,
to
have
overhead
the
conversation
between
mr.
butts,
who
was
then
the
athletic
director
of
the
university
of
georgia,
former
football
coach
and
paul
bryant,
who
was
then
as
he,
of
course,
he's
now
the
head
coach
of
the
university
of
alabama
football
team
and
the
athletic
director.
the
article
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
mr.
butts
had
ceased
to
be
the
coach
some
18
months
before
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
and
was
now
the
athletic
director
of
the
university.
mr.
bryant,
of
course,
was
the
coach
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
alabama
team.
the
article
in
no
uncertain
terms
reported
burnett's
statement
that
he
had
overheard
bryant,
butts
i
mean,
responding
to
bryant's
question,
“have
you
got
anything
for
me
wally?”
could
proceed
to
give
him
in
detail
statements
about
the
georgia
players'
formations
and
place
which
he
inferred
was
information
that
butts
was
giving
him
about
what
georgia
was
going
to
do
in
the
forthcoming
opening
game
of
the
1962
season
which
was
scheduled
to
take
place
some
nine
days
thereafter.
the
telephone
call
that
burnett
claimed
to
have
heard
was
on
september
13,
1962
and
the
game
between
alabama
and
georgia
was
to
be
paid
--
played
on
september
22nd.
at
the
end
of
this
conversation
or
in
the
course
of
this
conversation
i
suppose
recorded.
bryant
would
ask
butts
specific
questions
and
butts
would
answer,
“i
don't
know”.
and
bryant
would
say,
“can
you
find
out
for
me?”
and
butts
would
say,
“i'll
try.”
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
conversation,
bryant
asked
butts,
if
he
would
be
home
on
sunday.
and
butts
said
that,
he
would.
the
importance
of
that
last
statement
being
that
it
was
proved
by
records
of
the
telephone
company
that
a
september
13th
call
did
take
place
from
bryant
at
the
office
in
atlanta,
georgia.
that
burnett
had
been
trying
to
get
on
the
phone
to
the
alabama
or
athletic
office
in
tuscaloosa.
that
--
and
secondly,
that
on
the
following
sunday,
there
had
been
a
telephone
call
of
over
an
hour
duration
from
tuscaloosa
placed
by
bryant
and
charged
to
his
credit
card
to
wallace
butts
at
his
home
in
athens,
georgia.
now,
they
say
again
the
publication
on
the
basis
of
burnett's
story
charged
and
they
editors
of
the
post
affirmed
the
charged
in
an
accompanying
editorial
statement
that
butts
and
bryant
had
fixed
or
rigged
this
game
by
butts
giving
bryant
confidential
information
about
the
georgia
plays.
the
case
in
the
district
court
proceeded.
suit
was
filed
almost
immediately
after
the
publication.
case
proceeded
on
the
defendant's
plea
of
truth
and
that
was
apart
from
inconsequential
denials.
that
was
the
issue
in
the
trial
of
this
case
below
the
trial
court
charge
in
the
conventional
libel
terms
that
the
burden
of
proving
truth
was
on
the
defendant.
proof
--
truth
of
the
--
what
the
court
called
the
“sting
of
the
libel”,
viewing
the
sting
of
the
libel
as
a
charge
that
butts
had
given
bryant
information
calculated
to
influence
the
result
of
the
game
either
to
influence
to
won
or
lost
or
to
influence
the
score
by
which
the
game
was
brought.
i
think
the
judges'
words
were
calculated
or
likely
to
influence
the
result
of
the
game.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
there
was,
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that's
not
here.
bryant
brought
suit
in
alabama
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
shortly
after.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
suit
was
brought
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
tried,
verdict
before
new
york
times.
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
verdict,
i
might
say,
was
$60,000
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
what
new
york
times
decision
before
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
time.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
sir.
it
was
pending.
it
was
pending
in
this
court
actually
at
that
time.
the
verdict
as
i
say
was
$60,000,
general
damages;
$3
million,
punitive
damages.
and
on
motion
for
new
trial
addressed
to
the
verdict,
the
district
court
reduced
the
$3
million
punitive
damages
to
$400,000
on
remittitur
which
the
plaintiff
filed
so
that
the
verdict
entered
against
curtis
is
a
verdict
for
$460,000.
now,
i
say
the
case
presents
a
variant
of
the
new
york
times
problem
but
i
must
deal
first
with
the
question,
whether
that
issue
is
in
the
case.
the
point
was
raised
immediately
after
the
new
york
times
decision
by
curtis
on
motion
for
new
trial
filed
under
rule
60
(b).
this
actually
was
a
second
motion,
60
(b)
motion
that
curtis
filed.
the
first
one
being
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
district
court
ruled
on
that
motion
on
the
merits
and
held
that
new
york
times
did
not
apply
on
the
ground
that
the
athletic
director
was
the
employee
of
the
athletic
association
and
thus,
not
within
--
not
an
official
within
the
ambit
of
the
times
rule.
i'll
come
to
that,
of
course,
in
a
moment.
on
appeal,
however,
the
majority
of
the
fifth
circuit
of
the
court
below
did
not
pass
on
that
submission
but
rather
held
that
curtis
had
waived
the
new
york
times
point,
if
it
has
that
point,
by
not
raising
it
earlier
than
the
60
(b)
motion.
and
in
reaching
its
conclusion
as
to
waiver,
the
court
gave
weight
to
the
fact
that
among
the
counsel
for
curtis
in
the
georgia
case
or
the
counsel
cooperating
in
the
georgia
case,
were
alabama
counsel
who
had
also
been
counsel
for
the
times
in
alabama.
the
embry-beddow
firm
so
that
these
lawyers
knew
of
the
submissions
that
were
--
had
been
made
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
the
argument
of
times.
here,
on
that
ground
it
was
concluded
by
the
majority
below
that
there
is
an
actual
waiver
of
any
right
to
invoke
the
benefit
of
the
times
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
when
was
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
was
just
--
i
can
give
you
the
date
of
the
notice
of
appeal
and
also
that
was
january
24,
1964
and
the
60
(b)
motion
was
february
28,
1964,
the
first
60
(b)
motion.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
second
motion
was
the
amended
60
(b)
motion
invoking
sullivan
was
march
23,
1964.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
march
9,
1964.
the
case
was
argued
incidentally,
mr.
justice
fortas,
january
6,
1964,
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
granted
the
previous
january
of
1963.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no
constitutional
claim
was
made
in
the
trial
itself.
there
was
no
request
for
an
instruction
that
would
raise
comparable
points.
the
first
constitutional
claim
asserted
by
the
defendants
of
anybody
in
this
lawsuit
was
on
the
first
motion
for
new
trial
attacking
the
verdict.
there,
the
$3
million
verdict
was
attacked
on
first
amendment
grounds
and
quite
independently
of
sullivan
before
sullivan.
and
that
point,
i
think
it's
perfectly
claimed
as
judge
rives
very
strongly
emphasized
below
is
in
this
case
beyond
the
doubt.
i
mean,
if
it
is
a
point
that
there
are
constitutional
objections
to
the
magnitude
of
the
verdict
part
for
any
issue
privilege
as
to
publication.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
see
now
i'm
put
to
answer
that.
i
certainly
did
not
explicitly
urge
that
liability
be
maintained,
defended
sustained,
conditioned
on
a
privilege
defined
and
the
terms
that
the
court
find
the
privilege
in
sullivan.
there
is
a
part
of
the
argument,
however,
which
was
that
if
our
claim
for
total
immunity
was
not
sustained
that
some
accommodation
of
the
interest
in
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
and
certainly
in
the
oral
argument
that
was
true.
and
on
the
brief,
there
is
a
section
as
i
recall
but
the
--
i
certainly
would
not
submit
that
anybody
reading
our
brief
in
new
york
times
would
perceived
in
it
the
opinion
and
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case.
and
yet,
the
suggestion
below
really
is
that
anybody
who
is
familiar
with
the
petition
for
certiorari
ought
to
have
been
aware
of
what
was
going
to
happen
here
when
the
new
york
times
case
was
argued
properly.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yeah.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
right.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
and
--
and
i
don't
gamble
about
that.
the
simple
fact
in
this
lawsuit
was
that
the
trial
counsel
representing
curtis,
believing
in
their
plea
of
truth,
did
not
consider
that
the
existing
law
gave
them
any
claim
of
constitutional
privilege
and
they
will
not
dispose
to
do
any
legal
experimentation
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
that
is
the
honest
and
candid
fact
to
the
matter
and
that
the
result
of
it
is
that
we're
out
to
fail
--
for
failure
to
anticipate
the
times
ruling
then
we're
out.
but
i
submit
that
is
not
the
law
and
that
the
decision
of
this
court
made
perfectly
plain
that
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
a
change
in
law
whether
it
would
be
statutory
or
constitutional
or
decisional,
whether
it
be
state
law
or
federal
law,
may
be
invoked
on
direct
attack
on
appeal,
and
we
do
invoke
it
that
this
court
has
imposed
that
rule
on
the
state
under
the
supremacy
clause.
i
should
suppose
it
would
be
quite
plainly
imposed
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
pardon,
sir?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no.
i
consider
the
question
--
i
can
certainly
consider
the
question
of
law
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
unless
the
--
unless
there
is
contrariety
in
evidence
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
individuals
to
the
nature
of
what
he
does
or
--
but
i
consider
that
the
issue
whether
the
privilege
applies
is
an
issue
of
law
and
indeed
an
issue
of
constitutional
law.
indeed,
but
i
may
pass
beyond
the
waiver
point
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
on
which
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
only
two
judges
below
have
passed
judge
morgan,
the
district
court,
who
ruled
against
us
on
the
merits
and
judge
rives
dissenting
in
the
fifth
circuit
who
ruled
with
us
on
the
merits
in
the
view
that
new
york
times
should
be
deemed
to
apply.
now
passing
to
the
merits,
i
should
first
state
what
the
facts
are
that
bear
upon
the
issue
as
athletic
director.
the
record
shows
that
butts
was
in
general
charged
of
the
athletic
program
of
the
university
of
georgia,
subject
as
to
policy
direction
to
this
athletic
board.
well,
if
athletic
association
nominally
board
in
conventional
lingo
which
in
turn
was
responsible
to
the
president,
chancellor
and
regents.
it
was
a
corporation
introduced
into
the
atlantic
management
picture
on
a
pattern
that
many
universities
have
adopted.
the
main
motivation
for
it
being
that
it
freeze
contracting
from
state
audit
and
other
red
tape
limitations
that
stand
in
the
way
of
the
operation
of
college
athletics
on
the
big
time
business
basis
college
athletics
now
to
proceed.
i
say
again
as
to
butts'
position,
he
was
appointed
by
this
association,
fitting
into
the
picture
of
university
management.
in
the
way
that
it
did,
he
was
paid
by
the
association
with
slight
addendum
out
of
university
funds
that
i
take
it
that
had
something
to
do
with
preparing
a
way
for
getting
in
the
pension.
of
course
georgia
was
a
state
university,
the
regents
are
regarded
and
treated
explicitly
declared
to
be
a
department
of
the
state
government,
the
chancellor
and
president
or
indubitably
state
officials
and
the
athletic
association
has
a
majority
of
faculty
on
it
who
are
chosen
by
the
president
of
the
university,
complying
thereby
incidentally
with
the
standard
of
the
athletic
association
and
particularly
of
the
southeastern
conference
of
which
--
which
georgia
is
a
member.
now,
we
say
quite
simply
that
running
the
athletic
operation
of
a
state
university
puts
a
pressure
in
a
position
where
criticism
of
his
official
conduct
ought
to
be
considered
within
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
and
therefore,
within
the
scope
of
the
new
york
times
privilege.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
and
a
comment
related
to
its
quarterbacking?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
--
i
think
it
would
distort
the
concept
to
regard
the
quarterback
as
an
official
obviously.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
oh!
i
put
it
--
i
say
it
would
distort
the
concept
of
public
officials
but
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
but
i
wish
to
reserve
very
strongly
the
proposition,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
new
york
times
rule
is
not
to
be
envisaged
as
a
limited
ru
--
a
rule
limited
to
situations
in
which
the
complainant
is
a
“public
official”
within
a
characterization
would
be
given
to
the
context
of
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
any
absolute
immunity
doctrine
at
all.
i
completely
accept
as
i
must
the
conclusion
of
the
court
in
sullivan
that
to
the
extent
that
the
constitution
imposes
limitations
on
state
imposition
of
liability
for
libel.
the
limitation
that
it
imposes
is
a
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
proved
that
the
statement
was
false
and
it
was
uttered
by
the
defendant
with
knowledge
of
its
falsity
or
with
recklessness
as
to
whether
it
was
true
or
false.
that
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
--
may
i
give
you
a
somewhat
extended
answer
to
that
because
it's
the
heart
of
the
case.
i
say
that
the
mode
of
analysis
is
the
one
foreshadowed
in
the
court's
delineated
and
foreshadowed
in
the
court's
opinion
in
times.
that
the
first
question
to
be
faced
is
a
question
whether
the
publication,
whether
the
utterance,
is
an
utterance
with
which
freedom
to
publish
which
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
with
which
is
our
concern
to
the
first
amendment,
to
the
purposes
of
the
first
amendment.
i
come
back
to
what
you
said
in
the
argument
of
--
in
question,
the
150
you
remind
counsel
what
you
--
was
starting
with
the
first
amendment
and
that's
where
i
started.
and
now,
i
don't
mean
to
depreciate
the
difficulty
and
the
problems
this
court
must
face
in
deciding
whether
or
not
utterances,
expression
to
the
particular
kind
are
or
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
protection
that
the
first
amendment
as
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
confers.
this
is
an
area
that
can
be
an
area
of
enormous
difficulty.
it
has
been
--
it's
relatively
young
and
the
jurisprudences
of
the
court
being
only
40
years
old
or
so.
but
given
that
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
must
be
answered
as
a
legal
question
that
because
of
the
subject
matter
of
this
publication,
freedom
to
speak
published
is
within
the
scope
of
what
the
first
amendment
is
about.
now,
if
the
answer
is
favorable
to
that
it
is
within
the
scope
of
what
the
first
amendment
is
about.
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
considerations
that
led
the
court
in
times
to
conclude
that
strict
liability
is
offensive
to
the
constitutional
guarantee
that
some
amelioration
of
strict
liabilities
be
at
the
statutory
liabilities
of
the
sought
that
had
been
imposed
in
many
different
areas
or
be
at
the
120-year-old
rule
in
libel
that
imposes
strict
liability.
that
such
strict
liability
is
because
of
their
inevitable
effect
on
people
who
would
publish
must
be
mollified
and
the
principle
of
mollification,
the
limitation
of
liability
to
knowing
reckless
falsehood
seems
to
me
precisely
responsive
to
the
conflicting
values
that
are
involved.
as
i
said
in
my
brief,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
rule
is
in
itself
an
accommodation
of
whatever
public
interest
is
being
involved
to
justify
the
liability
or
suppression
on
the
one
hand
and
the
claim
of
freedom
on
the
other.
now,
it's
less
clear
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
is
at
all
concerned
with
the
gossip
columns
about
who
slept
with
whom
in
what
hotel
room
three
nights
previously.
and
well,
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
court
may
have
to
face
claims
of
privilege
for
such
publications
on
first
amendment
grounds.
if
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
conclusion
reached
that
the
first
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
type
of
publications.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
would
be
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
i
would
be
the
last
to
wish
to
impose
limitations
on
human
curiosity
and
i
think
that
in
taking
that
view,
i
speak
in
the
constitutional
provision.
first
amendment
was
concerned
with
the
nurturing
of
the
human
mind
by
discourse
and
communication.
but
coming
back
to
your
concrete
case
about
the
football
player,
who
betrays
the
team,
i
should
think
given
the
many
years
that
it
seems
to
obtain
nationally
about
the
subject
of
football
and
the
loyalties
that
are
involved
and
the
place
of
athletics
in
university
programs.
all
of
which
we've
allude
to
in
the
brief
with
the
best
materials
we
could
find,
argue
for
the
privilege
in
that
situation.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
sir.
now,
i
should
have
--
i
should
say,
of
course,
that
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
we
should
prevail
on
narrower
grounds
and
that
the
decision
in
rosenblatt
is
indistinguishable
in
any
principle
sense
from
the
decision
we
ask
for
here.
there
you
had
a
director
of
skiing
area.
here,
you
have
a
director
of
athletics
of
a
state
university
and
realize
that
rosenblatt
didn't
--
wasn't
an
ultimate
holding
for
the
plaintiff
but
it
did
send
the
case
back.
and
the
only
theory
on
which
we
say
that
went
fact
is
that
if
rosenblatt
established
that
he
was
in
charge
of
the
area
that
then
it
had
to
face
the
charge
privilege.
now,
i
know
i
should
also
have
said,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
answer
to
your
--
final
answer
to
your
question
that
i
do
very
strongly
rely
on
time
against
hill
--
on
the
decision
on
time
against
hill
and
supporting
the
general
thesis
that
i
advanced.
although,
i
realized
the
reservations
in
the
court's
opinion
there
that
issued
in
this
case
and
others
like
it,
deliberately
and
specifically
left
open.
i
nevertheless
suggest
that
the
very,
very
consideration
that
led
the
court
deeming
that
publication
to
be
within
the
realm
of
first
amendment
protection
to
be
something
that
the
first
amendment
was
concerned
about.
telling
people
about
the
new
play
that
or
relationship
to
an
actual
episode
in
human
life,
a
very
logic
that
led
the
court
then
to
precede
the
necessity
for
new
york
times
kind
of
privilege
and
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
repeatedly
reply
in
any
situation
whether
is
that
type
of
public
interest
in
the
publication.
and
i
would
have
as
a
final
thought
that
this
doesn't
set
the
law
quite
as
far
adrift
as
it
might
seem
to
because
the
issue
is
very
close
to
the
issue
that
state
courts
have
confronted
under
the
fair
comment
defense
in
asking
the
question,
whether
this
is
a
matter
to
which
the
privilege
of
fair
comment
applies
so
that
there
is
a
body
of
law,
a
body
of
thinking,
judicial
thinking
that
will
be
relevant
in
working
out
this
subject
in
closed
cases.
for
example,
we
have
a
fair
comment
case
in
new
york
that's
cited
in
the
brief
that
involved
a
high
school
football
coach
and
the
court
just
--
and
no
doubt
that
the
communities
entrust
in
the
performing
to
that
high
school
football
coach
was
something
that
could
be
published
about.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
conventional
limitation
on
the
fair
comment
rule
that
limits
its
availability
to
facts
accurately
states
it's
that
it
adds
nothing
to
the
plead
of
truth
really,
does
not
comport
--
cannot
comport
with
the
policies
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
you're
quite
right
about
it
but
the
--
any
judgmental
statement
like
betrayal
would
i
think
potentially
be
within
the
fair
comment
rule,
except
that
the
rule
is
generally
limited
to
comment
on
facts
truthfully
stated.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
so
that
unless
you
couple
it
with
a
plea
of
truth
as
to
the
factual
statement,
it
avails
nothing
and
if
you
have
got
a
plea
of
truth
as
to
the
factual
statements,
you
don't
need
it.
that's
i
think
the
essence
of
still
courts
have
confronted
the
question,
what
is
the
legitimate
subject
of
fair
comment?
and
it's
that
body
of
judge
made
law
that
i
point
to
us
helping
you
guide
judgment
in
the
development
of
this
first
amendment
clause.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
that's
certainly
a
reasonable
distinction.
but
i
would
suggest
this,
mr.
justice,
even
in
the
operation
of
magazine
publication.
there
comes
a
point
where
judgment
has
to
be
made.
that
the
story
has
been
adequately
investigated
to
satisfy
the
publishers
that
it
should
be
published.
and
how
far
it
is
prudent?
given
the
first
amendment
interest
and
the
weight
of
that
interest,
how
far
it
is
prudent
to
so
cast
the
scope
for
the
privilege
than
any
jury
second
guesses
that
invited
the
second
guess
to
every
publisher
as
to
whether
the
investigation
was
adequate
or
not,
that's
a
question
that
would
give
me
some
pause.
and
i
think
the
great
virtue
of
the
new
york
times
privilege
as
defined
in
that
opinion
is
that
it
faces
the
question
as
essentially
question
in
good
faith
of
the
publisher.
now
normally,
publishers
functioning
in
good
faith
had
no
interest
or
motive
to
publish
false.
and
it
certainly
it
hasn't
been
established
i
think
either
that
the
history
of
strict
liability
has
done
a
great
deal
for
reputation
or
that
the
standards
of
the
american
press
to
have
modified
in
dealing
with
public
fig
--
officials
since
the
decision
in
new
york
times.
i
think
press
is
functioning
as
it
has
before
and
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
i
think
it
had.
and
i
think
it
is
been
controlled
in
the
suppression
of
truth.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
i
do
indeed
think
it
has.
as
matter
of
fact,
if
i
may
say
a
word
in
closing,
i
invite
attention
to
this
bracket
as
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
problems
that
confront
a
publisher
if
he
must
show
in
a
plea
of
truth,
liability
established
truth,
assume
the
burden
of
proving
truth
or
else
face
liability.
if
you
study
this
charge,
i
think
you
find
for
example
that,
if
the
jury
is
unpersuaded
then
our
statement
was
true.
then
--
and
then
face
off
to
the
punitive
damage
question,
face
off
to
the
malice
question,
they
face
off
to
it
on
the
theory
that
the
publication
was
false.
well,
obviously,
we
know
our
top
people
testified
that
we
know
that
this
publication
hurt
butts.
how
could
you
publish
a
thing
like
this
and
not
expect
you
to
hurt
the
subject
of
it?
we
publish
it
because
we
believe
it
was
true.
well,
here's
a
built
in
case
of
malice.
now,
the
position
of
the
jury
may
well
have
been
that
it
was
uncertain
whether
this
was
true
or
not.
it
could
have
been
uncertain
about
the
telephone
calls.
it's
conceivable
to
made
any
--
it
could
have
been
uncertain
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
whether
burnett
really
hurt
this
or
whether
his
notes
which
are
in
the
record
and
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
them.
these
are
the
notes
that
were
in
evidence
at
page
1075
of
the
record.
do
these
notes
indicate
that
important
information
was
conveyed
or
not?
well,
there
were
six
football
coaches
who
testified,
four
of
them
testified.
they
thought
this
information
was
helpful
to
an
opposing
coach.
two
georgia
assistant
coaches
said,
“no,
there's
nothing
here
that
would
help
anybody.
mr.
schroder
was
a
great
football
player,
took
everybody
to
the
traces
on
what
these
various
formations
are.
my
life
was
spent
on
happily
on
the
law
library
and
i
can't
say
that
i
am
able
to
follow
even
after
a
careful
study,
these
explanations
in
the
record.
but
when
i
read
that
two
of
the
coaches
say
that
this
contained
the
main
formations
that
georgia
used
in
the
game
and
plan
to
use,
i
can
think
that
this
is
hardly
a
fabrication
and
when
i
read
at
the
end
that
bryant
was
going
to
call
butts
on
sunday
and
then
find
on
the
record
that
following
sunday
he
did
call
him
and
all
that
came
out
only
after
the
university
investigation
of
this
whole
matter
had
begun
then
i
am
able
to
view
what
is
even
a
possibility
that
this
thing
was
a
fabrication.
but
did
the
jury
--
was
the
jury
uncertain
whether
the
information
really
helped
bryant,
the
great
coach?
it
may
have
helped
him
only
by
telling
him
that
it
was
nothing
new
that
he
knew
nothing,
didn't
know.
but
it
would
be
enough
to
explain
the
jury
verdict
that
contrary
opinions
as
to
whether
the
information
helped
bryant
or
not,
left
them
on
a
state
of
uncertainty.
and
then
on
the
malice
charge,
i
don't
see
how
they
can
escape
finding
malice
if
they
must
approach
that
on
the
assumption
that
the
statements
were
false.
may
i
reserve
my
few
minutes?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
answer
in
the
brief
time.
mr.
justice
fortas,
on
your
question
about
the
alabama
public
man
statute,
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
50
of
the
petitioner's
briefs
--
brief
on
the
merits
wherein
the
footnote
12
the
authorities
have
brought
together
that
indicate
plainly
that
there
was
no
defense
of
good
faith
under
the
public
man
section
of
the
alabama
statute
and
it's
quite
indefensible
really
to
put
to
the
court
that
there
is
if
further
we
claim,
we
settle
by
the
cases
cited
in
the
last
paragraph
of
our
footnote
that
the
privilege
adds
nothing
to
the
plea
of
truth.
you
got
to
be
right
on
your
facts.
the
--
if
you
look
at
page
36
of
the
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits,
you'll
see
that
all
they
have
to
say
against
this
is
that
in
georgia,
the
earlier
of
conflicting
authorities
governed.
well,
you
know
there
is
that
special
doctrine
in
georgia
but
i
will
simply
say
that
it
has
no
application
here
because
these
are
high
court
cases,
supreme
court
cases,
and
there
the
latest
authoritative
case
would
govern.so
that's
absolutely
out.
the
second
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
reference
was
made
to
mr.
strubing
that
was
here
in
his
participation
in
this
litigation.
his
affidavit
is
at
page
1340
of
the
record
and
where
he
makes
clear
that
there
was
no
deliberate
intention
to
surrender
any
rights
of
the
post
in
this
pleading
business
but
as
i
said,
in
my
argument
i
don't
regard
that
as
major,
any
how.
now
coming
to
the
facts
which
i
cannot
and
unhappily
review
in
a
minute
and
a
half,
may
i
at
least
direct
the
court's
attention
to
two
points?
first,
even
if
mr.
schroder
was
right
and
this
was
a
clearer
cases
of
recklessness
as
he
thinks
it
is,
he
says
it
is,
i
submit
that
we've
been
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
on
it
under
a
right
of
a
basic
point,
under
a
malice
--
proper
malice
instruction
as
the
court
held
in
rosenblatt
and
other
cases
that
will
reversed
without
ruling,
and
indeed
in
time
against
hill.
i
can't
believe
that
mr.
schroder
remains
to
argue
that
there
wasn't
a
jury
question
here
on
malice.
but
if
he
does
mean
to
argue
that,
then
i
must
direct
attention
to
the
summary
on
pages
68
and
9
of
our
brief
which
indicates
that
we
do
not
concur
in
his
reading
of
the
record.
for
example,
he
said
that
notes
were
available.
the
notes
were
not
available
at
the
time
when
the
post,
the
representatives
were
in
touch
with
burnett.
why
weren't
they?
because
they'd
been
turned
over
to
the
university
authorities
by
burnett
when
he
reported
this
on
january
4th,
the
notes
were
in
the
hands
of
mr.
cook
bowwick,
the
counsel
with
the
athletic
board
and
the
whole
matter
was
being
investigated
by
the
university
authorities.
now,
he
says,
“if
we
only
have
the
notes.
then
we
would
have
known
why.”
well,
obviously
from
our
point
of
view,
we
had
the
notes
who
would
have
confirmed
our
view
that
this
conversation
occurred
and
that
butts
did
give
bryant
this
information.
that
is
the
way
we
read
the
notes.
that
is
the
way
they
will
read
by
chief
coach
griffith,
on
the
night
when
they
were
turned
over
to
him.
that
is
the
way
they
were
read
by
the
georgia
university
authorities.
we
knew
also
that
butts
have
resigned
precipitately
which
didn't
exactly
seem
to
be
the
action
of
an
innocent
man.
we
knew
further
that
the
matter
was
taken
with
the
greatest
seriousness
by
the
university
authorities
and
by
the
state.
now,
all
those
things
were
known
that
i
say,
i
must
close
by
the
referring
to
the
summary
of
this
material
at
pages
68
the
following
our
brief.
thank
you.
