mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
a
participant
in
this
legal
conflict
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
the
doctors
have
a
rule
that
they
never
operate
members
of
the
family.
perhaps
lawyer
should
have
a
rule
that
they
should
not
participate
in
cases
in
which
the
two
closely
involved.
at
the
inception
of
this
litigation
or
of
this
argument,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
have
known
this
man
as
a
classmate
and
as
a
fellow
soldier
for
too
long.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
and
if
i
make
some
suggestions
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
it
does.
there's
--
i
just
apologizing
in
advance.
i
don't
intend
to
get
off
in
these
areas
and
i,
in
advance,
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
i
do
it's
an
error
of
the
mind
and
not
of
the
heart.
now
first,
the
issues
in
this
lawsuit,
although
apparently
complicated,
are
essential
in
sense.
as
counsel
stated
the
basic
issue
is
whether
there
is
an
immunity
upon
the
press
in
this
case,
falsely
to
accuse
a
man
of
crime.
by
our
concept,
the
action
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
--
that
is
our
contention.
oh!
that
is
their
contention.
yes
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that
is
the
effect,
sir,
of
the
argument
primarily
of
the
amicus
curiae
and
essentially
of
the
associated
press.
in
this
case,
unlike
any
reported
case
before
this
honorable
court
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
because
the
new
york
times
case
did
not
involve
the
charge
of
crime.
in
this
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
not
as
such
as
i
get
garrison.
the
issue
i
am
endeavoring
to
submit
and
suggest
to
your
honors
is,
that
this
court
is
now
plowing
out
the
perimeter
as
have
built
--
been
well-stated
by
the
authors
of
new
york
times
of
the
rule
of
that
case
extending
immunity
to
the
press,
threading
along
the
boundary
between
the
freedom
of
the
individual
from
accusa
--
from
false
accusation
and
false
defamation
as
distinguished
from
the
freedom
of
the
press
to
timely,
to
accurately,
and
timely
report
the
news.
now,
that
is
the
responsibility
and
it
is
a
somewhat
of
an
awesome
responsibility
that
now
rest
upon
the
shoulders
of
this
court,
to
fit
the
perimeter
in
a
manner
in
which
the
citizen
will
not
be
troubled
by
an
all
powerful
press
in
endeavoring
to
make
this
position
known
by
a
freedom
on
the
part
of
the
press
to
accuse
him
falsely
of
the
commission
of
crime.
now,
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
an
accusation
against
this
man
that
promptly
resulted
in
his
incarceration
in
a
federal
mental
institution.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
legal
issues
have
been
summarized
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
associated
press.
i
will
go
down
those
issues
for
brevity
and
simplicity,
the
time
is
short,
in
order
to
spotlight
before
this
honorable
court
the
issues
as
i
comprehended.
the
first
statement
that
is
made
in
the
reply
brief
is
that
walker,
in
attempts
to
create
the
impression
that
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
a
felony
and
separate
various
other
humiliations
as
a
direct
and
proximate
result
of
news
reports.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
first
associated
press
news
release
on
page
1229
of
the
record,
wherein
at
now
in
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that
is
volume
3
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir,
page
1229
of
the
record.
under
a
release
time
of
9:20
that
the
court
rule
recognized,
at
the
bottom
of
page
1222
--
i
as
you
are
page
1230,
with
release
time
of
9:20,
the
associated
press
reported
that
this
man
had
assumed
command
of
the
a
mob
and
he
led
a
charged.
the
reporter
who
issued
that
news
release
was
listed
upon
the
government's
complaint,
in
this
case,
as
having
furnished
information
upon
which
this
man
was
thrown
in
jail
and
a
fantastic
course
of
events
that
thereof
occurred
illustrates
graphically
and
dynamically
to
this
court,
the
potential
nuclear
impact
of
a
--
an
extreme
power
of
the
press
to
falsely
--
to
accuse
the
man
falsely
of
a
crime.
now
this
man
was
siezed
taken
before
a
united
states
commission
ordered
to
be
confined
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
the
custody
of
the
marshal
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
within
an
hour
a
telegram
arrived
from
the
department
of
justice,
directing
his
transportation
to
springville,
missouri.
and
without
a
court
order,
without
notice,
without
counsel,
without
a
hearing,
this
man
who
is
tried
and
admitted
to
a
prison,
mental
hospital,
in
defiance
of
almost
of
every
right
known
to
the
constitution
and
the
law
books
of
this
great
man.
the
next
day,
upon
an
affidavit
of
a
psychiatrist
who
had
never
seen
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
said
this
was
triggered
by
the
release
at
9:25
on
the
evening
of
the
riot.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
immediately
on
the
reporter,
sir,
who
made
the
release,
appeared
on
the
government's
complaint
as
the
witness
furnishing
the
information
upon
which
walker
is
incarcerated.
so
the
issue
i'm
endeavoring
to
present
to
this
honorable
court
is
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
if
your
honor
would
turn
to
the
answer
to
amicus
curiae
brief
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it's
page
7
of
the
appendix.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
page
7,
the
amicus
answer
to
amicus
curiae
brief
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
i
don't
remember
whether
that
was
specifically
entered
in
the
trial
or
not.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
those
facts
were
all
over
the
trial,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
couldn't
say
it
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
if
my
recollection,
i
won't
to
be
--
i
want
to
recheck
and
answer
your
honor's
question
precisely.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright,
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
to
answer
your
question,
sir.
i
have
rechecked
the
record.
i
have
tried
two
of
these
very
extensive
lawsuits
and
when
i
rechecked
my
mental
process,
when
counsel
referred
to
louisiana
case
that
is
specifically
in
the
record
of
louisiana
case.
in
the
texas
case,
it
is
not
in
the
trial
record.
i
presented
in
my
brief
solely
as
an
example
of
what
can
happen
to
an
individual
citizen,
if
the
press
is
free
to
accuse
him
falsely
with
a
crime.
that's
the
answer
to
that.
now
sir,
i
was
discussing
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
he
was
arrested.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
given
into
the
custody
of
the
u.s.
marshal
for
confinement
by
court
order
in
mississippi.
without
a
court
order
on
that
on
a
telegram
from
the
department
of
justice,
he
would
put
on
the
motor
patrol
plane,
not
told
where
it
was
going.
on
a
pursuant
to
an
affidavit
from
a
psychiatrist
in
washington
who
had
never
seen,
said
he
read
news
reports.
and
he
was
shipped
to
springville,
missouri,
prison
mental
hospital,
in
an
atmosphere
of
criminal
insanity.
the
next
day,
without
notice
counsel
or
hearing,
an
order
was
signed
committing
there
for
the
period
that
it
took
to
examine
which
developed
within
90
days
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
this
is
not
heard.
they
just,
sir,
asked
me
all
that
what
happened.
i
was
just
outlining.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
no,
sir.
that
--
as
i
remember
now,
that
could
have
been
involved
in
the
louisiana
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
and
in
the
texas
case.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it
was
excluded.
the
court
had
no
rule
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
relationship
with
the
acts
of
incidents
between
walker
and
the
government
of
the
texas
case.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
as
claim,
sir
that
the
associated
press
triggered
the
course
of
events
which
resulted
in
this
fantastic
situation.
they
on
the
night
of
september
30,
and
prior
to
the
reply
brief
of
the
associated
press.
and
on
the
night
of
september
30,
they
issued
the
new
release
at
9:25,
that
walker
had
assumed
command
of
the
crowd
and
led
the
charge.
now,
as
mr.
--
my
brother
rogers
has
outlined
has
been
tried
in
two
cases,
two
juries
upheld
that
he
did
not
lead
the
charge.
now,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
he
was
order
to
be
held
after
90
days.
i
finally
got
him
out
at
the
end
sixth
day
by
going
back
to
mississippi.
i
couldn't
even
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
what
i
say
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
what
happened
in
this
case,
sir?
the
associated
press
said
that
he
had
committed
the
crimes
of
insurrection,
sedition,
seditious
conspiracy,
and
assaulting
u.s.
officers.
immediately
he
was
arrested.
he
was
seized
and
taken
to
the
prison
mental
hospital
in
springville,
missouri,
without
notice
for
counsel
and
hearing
and
on
an
affidavit
of
the
psychiatrist
who
had
never
seen
him.
now
that
was
only
direct
and
approximate
result,
sir,
of
the
false
news
report
that
can
happen
when
the
news
media
has
no
intention
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
nature
of
damages
in
this
case.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
but
it's
relevant
only
to
the
extent
of
illustrating.
what
can
happen
to
an
american
citizen
when
--
who
is
exercising
his
right
of
freedom
of
free
speech,
when
the
newspapers
uninhibited
by
financial
responsibility
from
accusing
him
falsely
of
a
crime.
i
offered
solely
sir
as
an
illustration
of
what
can
happen
under
the
rule
demanded
by
the
press
in
this
case
and
to
freedom
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
charged
with
sedition,
assault
of
the
u.s.
office
--
officers,
insurrection
and
seditious
conspiracy.
four
crimes
that
he
had
take
the
self
--
he's
a
combat
soldier
in
the
united
states
army
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution
in
united
states.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
grand
jury
dismissed
the
charge.
refused
to
indict,
the
government
dismissed
the
charges.
and
there
as
i
show
in
this
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
in
mississippi,
yes,
sir.
as
i
say
and
have
presented
to
this
honorable
court,
in
the
briefs
the
associated
press
gamble
for
the
highest
stakes
known
to
human
conflict,
the
reputation
and
liberty
of
an
american
citizen.
they
gamble
for
extensive
financial
profit
by
presenting
around
the
world
on
their
war
services.
the
intelligence
of
this
man,
a
former
general
officer
in
the
united
states
army,
had
to
assume
command
of
a
rag
tag,
band
of
students,
and
had
led
the
charge
on
the
government
that
he
had
sworn
to
defend
against
all
enemies,
foreign
and
domestic.
now,
that
was
not
passed
around
the
world
for
profit
service
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
here
by
my
concept
of
it,
i
--
those
statements
are
enforced.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
regret
them
but
i
do
not
believe
they
could
have
triggered
them,
sir,
because
they
were
not
a
crime.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
they
were
not
a
crime.
in
other
words,
that
was
an
argument
that
general
walker
had
very
vehemently
and
acoustically
presented
but
it
was
not
he
accused
no
other
crime.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
has
the
associated
press
falsely
accused
walker
of
a
crime?
if
they
have
or
they're
privilege
under
the
constitution
to
accuse
a
man
of
crime
when
they
--
when
their
report
says,
“i
saw
walker
led
the
charge
from
a
distance
of
6
feet.
and
when
walker
answered,
“did
you
really
saw
me
or
you
didn't?
if
you
saw
me,
i
am
guilty
of
a
crime.
i've
been
properly
charged.
if
you
didn't
see
me,
i
have
been
falsely
accused.”
now,
that's
the
issue
and
we're
--
as
much
as
i
regret,
the
incompetent
statements
that
were
made,
sir,
and
i
sincerely
regret
them.
but
that
is
a
collateral
issue
that
as
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court,
has
been
injected
into
this
lawsuit
for
the
purpose
or
for
its
obvious
purpose.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that's
i
what
i
was
--
and
then
they
were
just
--
the
fact.
i
appreciate
that
sir.
my
time
is
short
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
number
one,
the
associated
press
has
had
every
advantage
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
they
have
had
every
advantage
of
the
rule
of
the
sullivan
case.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
request
the
jury
under
texas
special
issue
proceeding.
did
you
--
do
you
find
that
this
report
was
knowingly
false
or
in
reckless
disregard
of
truth?
they
elect
the
places
to
refrain
from
making
such
a
request.
under
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure,
when
they
make
no
such
request,
they
wait.
now,
here
is
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
was
made
actually
more
onerous
to
the
plaintiff
than
is
sullivan
had
said.
and
the
jury
was
instructed
in
the
definition
of
fair
comment.
here
instructed
that
by
said
term
has
made
a
statement
that
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that's
an
informal
letter.
yes,
sir.
it
did
--
it
did
not
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
well,
i
--
i
construe
it's
just
the
letter
to
counsel.
it
was
never
entered
down
the
record
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i'm
glad
you
already
answered
that
question
because
that
is
rather
on
target
on
the
--
really
the
only
issue
in
the
lawsuit.
there
was
no
evidence
of
actual
malice
as
defined
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
as
defined
by
the
texas
law
and
is
outlined
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
am
going
to
outline
that
here
sir.
that
the
court
vacated
the
punitive
damages
finding.
and
here
is
the
--
the
finding
of
his
record.
do
you
find
that
the
report
was
actuated
by
malice
as
the
term
is
defined?
definition:
“malice
is
meant
ill
will,
bad
or
evil
motive;
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
right
or
welfare
of
a
person.”
now,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
not
a
definition
of
sullivan
type
of
malice.
the
court
also
interrogated
the
jury,
“do
you
find
--
and
this
was
a
finding
that
remained
in
the
case.
it
was
not
disturbed
by
any
texas
court.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
don't
construe
it
that
way.
he
said
that
new
york
times
doesn't
apply.
therefore,
it
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that's
the
question
i
was
about
to
address
myself
to
moment
ago.
the
court
actually
in
under
special
issues,
one
and
five,
told
this
jury
that
fair
comment
is
a
statement
which
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
now,
that
is
the
ultimate
that
can
be
demanded
by
the
news
media
under
new
york
times.
in
other
words,
the
associated
press,
every
option
in
the
trial
of
this
case
to
demand
a
special
issue
of
this
jury,
do
you
find
that
this
publication
was
in
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth
or
was
knowingly
false?
the
associated
press
selected
not
to
do
that,
why?
because
the
special
issue
i
presented
into
the
jury
was
even
more
difficult
for
the
plaintiff
than
was
new
york
--
the
new
york
times
rule.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
sir
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
solely
--
solely
sir,
as
to
express
malice
for
the
purpose
of
punitive
damages
which
is
i
have
outlined.
there
is
a
vast
distinction
under
texas
law
of
expressed
malice
for
punitive
damage
and
sullivan
type
malice
which
is
knowingly
false
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
we
do
have
too
many
cases
too
long
i
have
seen
judge
has
go
on
and
comment
on
many
things
that
we
can
refer
to
as
dicta.
and
frankly
to
me,
sir,
that
is
dicta
that
he
used
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that
is
it
dicta
so
that
the
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
the
new
york
times
rule
was
made.
when
the
judge
--
here's
the
point
i
am
endeavoring
to
get
over
to
the
court.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
in
framing
the
issues,
this
defendant
was
perfectly
contempt
to
rely
on
the
definition
of
fair
comment
as
given.
do
you
find
that
this
report
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer?
the
jury
said,
“no”.
do
you
find
that
this
report
was
published
in
good
faith?
now,
there's
no
rule
under
new
york
times
and
those
findings
placed
here
remain
in
the
record.
they
are
undisturbed
by
the
trial
court,
the
seventh
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
so,
we
now
confront
this
honorable
court,
confront
this
case
in
this
posture.
in
the
record
there
is
a
finding
that
this
report,
that
walker
assumed
command
of
the
mob
and
led
the
charge,
is
not
fair
comment
and
is
not
“the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer”.
in
other
words,
there
goes
a
man
who
has
said
in
a
news
report,
“from
a
distance
of
six
feet,
i
saw
walker
assumed
command
of
the
crowd
and
led
a
charge”.
the
jury
said,
“that
is
fault.
that
is
not
your
honest
opinion
at
that
time
you
wrote
it.”
the
jury
also
said,
it
is
--
it
was
not
published
in
good
faith.”
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
jury
found
a
deliberately
false
statement
because
the
--
in
the
special
issue
under
which
the
associated
press
was
contempt
to
present
this
case
to
the
jury
said,
they're
entitled
to
fair
comment
which
is
a
statement
that
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no.
well,
i
think
his
comment
was
wrong
about
new
york
times.
so
i
think
he
got
off
into
an
area
that's
large
frankly
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
say
sir
that
in
the
first
place,
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
he
was
dealing
only
with
punitive
damage.
he
did
not
pass
upon
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
other
than
approve
it
the
other
special
issues.
and
he
approved
the
special
issues
and
said
this
was
not
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
that's
the
inevitable
fact
that
i
am
endeavoring
to
present
to
the
court.
so
my
first
contention
is,
gentlemen,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
that
the
plaintiff
--
the
defendant
has
had
every
benefit
of
new
york
times.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
as
to
my
recollection,
the
texas
counsel
had
unless
my
recollection
he
did.
i
know
we
intended
to
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh!
yes,
we
did
in
the
texas
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
lost
that
in
the
texas
court.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
right,
sustained
by
three
courts.
and
in
the
language
of
the
appellate
court,
the
appellee
had
failed
to
prove
malice
as
defined.
now
again,
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
definition
of
malice
that
was
ruled
out
and
the
court
held,
we
did
not
prove.
malice
is
meant
ill
will.
sullivan
does
not
involve
ill
will.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i'm
reading,
sir,
from
the
finding
--
finding
special
issue
number
8
in
page
about
58
of
the
record
or
on
page
22
of
my
brief.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
blue
brief.
malice
is
meant
l
ill
will,
bad
or
evil
motive,
have
that
entire
want
which
will
raise
to
believe
from
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
right
or
welfare
of
the
person
to
be
affected.
now,
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
that
we
had
not
through
that.
they
left
intact
in
our
ground
undisturbed.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
the
word
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
the
word
“conscious”,
if
your
honor
please?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
it
is
similar.
just
like
a
horse
is
similar
to
a
cow
but
a
horse
is
not
a
cow.
a
conscious
indifference
involved
an
element
of
evil
deliberate
design.
it
is
necessary
under
texas
law
to
get
punitive
damages.
that
court
held
that
we
have
not
proved
a
conscious
indifference.
but
your
honors
upheld
that
if
you
prove
a
reckless
disregard
so
--
and
i'm
going
to
commend
your
honor
a
careful
evaluation
of
the
sullivan
rule.
creation,
as
i
heard
counsel
very
aptly
stated
this
morning
of
a
guideline
and
i
think
one
of
the
members
of
this
honorable
court
made
a
suggestion
to
that
guideline
were
indicated
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
this
court
now
is
involved
in
writing
a
guideline
that
will
fix
the
perimeter
between
the
freedom
of
the
individual
against
false
accusation
and
defamation
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
report
to
news.
and
i'm
here
to
cover
if
i
have
time
in
this
issue
that
when
the
issue
involved
is
false
accusation
of
a
felony,
the
press
improper,
the
press
in
constitution,
the
press
can
carefully
assume
a
standard
of
care
that
will
prevent
precipitous
false
accusation
of
a
crime
and
have
a
man
thrown
in
jail,
completely
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
the
press
charged
him.
and
in
simple
language,
it
is
the
design
of
the
constitution
to
the
united
states
of
america
at
the
press
report
the
news
and
not
makes
the
news
as
they
did
in
this
case.
they
have
a
basic
defect,
the
defect
in
this
lawsuit,
the
greatest
news
of
media
on
the
face
of
the
earth
was
absorbing
the
actions
of
this
unfortunate
event
in
oxford,
mississippi.
an
individual
arrived
there
who
have
previously
had
created
of
him
a
public
image.
everything
that
was
written
by
associated
press
expanded
that
public
image
as
a
criminal
lunatic.
we
perhaps
support
the
fact
that
the
united
press
reported
that
during
along
in
the
rioting,
general
walker
manned
the
confederate
statue
and
begged
the
students
to
avoid
violence.
now,
i'm
sure
your
honor
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
to
avoid
violence
which
is
absolutely
the
truth?
we
prove
to
everybody
the
overwhelming
evidence
and
general
walker
was
utmost
at
all
the
students,
a
protest
in
this
unfortunate
event
that
he
cautioned
the
student
to
avoid
violence.
now,
there
are
many
few
witnesses,
not
many
and
all
of
them
incidentally
were
members
of
the
news
media.
they
came
in
and
reported
that
they
heard
walker
versus
the
report
of
counsel
made.
he
say,
riot!
riot!
and
general
walker
like
myself
has
built
our
careers.
what
he
said,
“right,
right!
right,
right.”
when
there's
someone
asked
him
something
he
said,
“right!
right!”
well,
witness
has
heard
it
and
reporter
heard
it,
“riot!
riot!”
now,
that
shows
what
can
happen
after
a
no
restraint
on
the
news.
now,
what
i
desperately
hope
to
get
over
to
this
honorable
court
is
that
you're
dealing
with
news
as
a
commercial
commodity.
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
the
associated
press
as
recognized
by
this
honorable
court
in
its
opinion
in
associated
press
against
the
united
states.
there's
no
single
element
by
traditional
insistence
upon
equality
of
fair
trial
for
every
person
from
which
any
such
discriminatory
practice
can
stand.
member
of
the
publishers
of
the
associated
press
are
engaged
in
business
for
profit
exactly
as
our
other
businessmen
who
sell
food,
steel,
aluminum
or
anything
else
people
need
or
want.
the
fact
that
the
publisher
handle
his
news
while
others
handle
food
does
not
at
which
i'll
later
point
out
afford
the
publisher
a
peculiar
constitutional
sanctuary
in
which
he
can
with
impunity,
violate
laws
regulating
his
business
practices.
one
of
the
laws
that
regulate
the
practice
of
selling
the
news
is
that,
thou
shall
not
falsely
defame
or
accuse
thy
name.
now,
we're
dealing
in
this
case
as
your
--
as
this
honorable
court
has
recognized
many
times
where
a
public
debate
it
goes
to
the
very
essence,
the
very
foundation
of
the
survival
of
this
country.
the
question
is
to
what
extent
can
an
individual
citizen
debate
with
a
newspaper,
with
the
associated
press,
or
the
magazine.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
unless
coupled
with
the
fantastic
economic
power
of
the
associated
press
and
its
related
news
organs,
there
is
coupled
a
financial
responsibility,
the
news
that
those
people
sell
to
the
world
of
the
common
drug
on
the
market.
as
i
remember,
one
of
the
imminent
writers
in
the
early
days
of
this
great
country
of
ours,
made
a
comment
that
it
is
pureness
alone
that
gives
things
at
right.
what
we
obtained
too
chiefly,
too
chiefly
we
as
deem
to
life.
now
when
the
people
attained
a
new
product
and
this
is
a
commercial
product
that
is
not
based
upon
the
financial
integrity
of
the
manufacturers
of
that
product,
if
the
court
please,
the
confidence
of
the
american
people
in
the
news
media
that
represents
them
or
be
completely
wiped
away
and
the
credibility
gap
will
extend
so
completely
that
the
people
will
believe,
in
nothing
they
read
and
nothing
they
hear.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
honorable
court
that
the
greatest
disservice
that
could
possibly
done
by
the
associated
press
in
this
case
is
to
permit
them
to
manufacture
and
sell
news
without
the
trademark
of
their
responsibility
behind
it.
now,
that's
the
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
now
as
to
the
effects
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
had
they
said
he
assume
command
of
the
crowd.
i
have
very
carefully
outlined
all
the
issues
in
this
case
are
on
the
efforts.
incidentally
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
he
did
not.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
that's
part.
then
he
assumed
command
of
the
crowd
and
led
the
charge.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
now,
i
have
analyzed
in
the
utmost
detail
in
the
evidence
of
this
case,
it
is
more
than
conflict.
it
is
overwhelming.
if
anyone
will
read
it,
the
general
walker
entered
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
in
the
part
of
the
crowd.
the
witnesses
testified
that
he
walked
towards
the
flagpole
which
was
in
the
center
of
the
circle
almost
the
length
of
a
football
field
the
lyceum.
the
evidence
is
also
so
completely
conflicting
that
this
young
cover
reporter
called
the
news
room
in
new
orleans
in
the
office
--
or
on
the
telephone.
he
said,
“i
have
seen
judge
walker
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
general
walker
come
on
this
campus
make
a
speech,
inflamed
the
crowd
and
led
the
charge.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
this
reporter
that
issued
the
charge
that
brought
the
charges.
incidentally,
he
was
the
only
one
of
six
newsmen
of
associated
press
on
the
campus
that
night
that
even
purported
to
have
seen
anything
of
this
kind.
the
associated
press
brought
to
court,
sir,
not
one
employee
of
the
associated
press.
they
brought
to
court
that
one
united
states
marshal.
not
one
highway
patrolman.
we
brought
a
highway
patrolman.
we
brought
a
reporter
from
the
new
york,
from
the
washington
star,
who
was
addressing
with
general
walker
on
the
campus
that
night.
no
one
in
the
world
that
we
have
seen
except
this
newsman
and
among
other
who
has
so
completely
conflicting
in
his
testimony
and
he
was
unworthy
of
belief.
no
one
else
has
ever
--
even
insinuated
that
general
walker
led
the
charge.
now
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
did
not
testify
in
this
case
except
for
not
kept
his
depositions
and
overdo
the
excerpt
covering
this.
they
brought
him
to
--
this
i
need
to
get
outside
the
record
that
counsel
i
just
refer
to
the
louisiana
case.
they
brought
him
to
louisiana.
the
judgment
there,
the
verdict
was
$3
million
because
we
had
actually
pled
for
$3
million.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
introduced
excerpts
with
deposition.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
sorry?
i
got
to
fill
here
and
place
in
this
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
could
find
it
if
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
i
just
take
look
--
take
a
little
bit
of
time.
but
i
offered
the
testimony
to
prove
respondeat
superior.
to
prove
that
the
order
of
this
police
report
that
said
from
a
distance
of
six
feet,
“i
saw
walker
lead
this
charge
so
i
know
such
thing.
i
also
offered
the
news
--
the
said
speech
of
the
associated
press
itself
which
preceded
the
argument.
it
said,
“here
is
the
story-events
available,
21,
associated
press
newsman.
he
was
there
and
saw
what
happened.
the
jury
held
he
was
there
but
he
didn't
see
what
he
said
he
saw.
now,
these
issues
have
been
litigated,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court.
thirdly,
i
mean
where
the
complete
opportunity
of
the
associated
press
to
prove
not
just
--
the
only
they
have
to
prove
was
that
this
was
the
honest
opinion
of
surveillance.
they
could
not
approve
--
they
could
not
prove
that
in
a
trial
that
i
submit
respectfully
to
this
court
was
eminently
fair
by
a
judge
who
took
and
look
up
our
effort
for
every
interest
that
the
associated
press
says.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
jury
was
out
as
i
remember
couple
of
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours.
may
be
more
but
they
were
out
of
substantial
length
of
time.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
--
the
special
issues
submitted
to
the
jury,
“do
you
find
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
there.
yes,
sir.
and
i
say
that
had
he
not
been
permitted
to
accused
of
a
crime
and
here,
i
better
get
minute
on
my
concept
of
the
sullivan.
i
think
the
sullivan
rule
has
a
wholesome
implication
to
help
the
news
media
report
confused
events.
but
i
feel
that
unless
the
sullivan
rule
is
implemented
with
financial
responsibility
where
they
assume
--
where
they
gamble
for
profit
upon
the
freedom
of
american
citizen
and
falsely
accuse
him
of
a
crime,
i
do
not
believe
then
that
they
are
entitled
to
any
different
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
your
honor
had
the
right
on
target.
i
could
speak
for
a
week
and
not
answer
anymore.
he
said,
“i
saw
walker
assume
command
of
the
mob
and
led
the
charge”.
the
jury
said,
“he
didn't”.
now
that
could
be
nothing
other
than
knowingly
false.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
if
it's
false.
what
the
jury
find
was
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
general
walker
stated
that
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright,
sir.
there
is
a
confederate
monument.
general
walker
said
that
he
arrived
on
the
campus.
so
he
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
he
said
he
went
there
because
he'd
command
and
led
the
mob.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
had
commanded
the
incident
--
the
situation
looked.
he
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
concept
of
using
armed
forces
for
political
purposes.
that
was
his
purpose
solely
in
this
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
--
general
walker,
if
i
could
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
not
opposing
--
he
was
not
opposing
the
presidential
decree.
he
objected
in
his
language
and
in
his
testimony
to
bring
26,000
troops
to
mississippi
from
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
who
sent
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh!
the
troops
were
sent
there
for
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
but
as
the
senate,
he
objected
and
his
objection
was
completely
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
as
a
former
commander
of
the
troops
that
are
brought
there,
he
knew
the
awesome
impact
of
sharp
federal
bandits
into
the
backs
of
helpless
civilians.
and
he
went
there
to
protest
26,000
troops
down
in
mississippi.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
he
asked
sir.
he
asked
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh,
no,
sir.
he
said
he
went
there
to
--
well,
not
in
so
many
terms.
he
said
he
went
there
to
protest
the
use
of
troops.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
that's
what
he
said,
he
went
there.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
he
didn't
say
he
went
there.
let's
say
i'm
standing
there.
i
act
his
actions,
“now,
gentlemen
just
what
is
your
purpose
in
going
to
mississippi?”
this
is
on
page
13
of
the
blue
brief.
“i
thought
it
was
absolutely
wrong
to
use
military
forces
--
troops,
american
troops
and
strictly
civilian
problem.
alright,
mr.
watts
let
him
finish
and
i
wanted
to
see
for
myself
exactly
what
happened.
i
wanted
know
first
hand
information.
i
did
not
trust
the
press
reporting
of
it.
in
any
forms,
since
i
have
been
in
law
and
i've
seen
that
exaggerated
out
of
all
proportions,
and
i
intended
to
see
for
myself.
now
his
testimony,
your
honor
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
there
was
some
more
testimony
on
the
record
but
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
and
--
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
what?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
in
those
--
even
--
what?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
now,
they
even
by
inference,
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
don't
so
construe
in
his
testimony.
and
he
testified
based
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
don't
get
unarmed
because
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
--
he
felt
very
keen
as
i've
suggested
as
a
soldier
that
this
was
a
misuse
of
military
problem
and
i
don't
consider
as
was
called
upon.
however,
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
lawsuit
was
tried
in
order.
in
other
words
sir,
they
tried
walker
in
place
of
crime
of
action.
the
jury
was
charged
of
finding
out
did
walker
lead
the
charge?
was
it
--
did
that
young
reporter,
when
he
led
that
charge,
was
he
honest
in
saying
that,
“i
saw
him
assume
command
and
lead
the
charge.
and
was
it
published
in
good
faith?
that's
what
the
jury
was
charged.
the
counsel
for
the
associated
press
just
saturated
the
record
for
these
unfortunate
and
inflammatory
statements.
and
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it
is
and
i
regret
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
suppose
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
agree
with
your
honor.
but
there
the
question,
did
he
assume
command
of
this
mob.
that
was
the
question.
and
we
proved
this
jury
conclusively,
sir,
that
he
did
not
assume
command
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
there.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
believe,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
the
jury
found
without
the
young
reporter
being
there.
the
found
that
walker
being
there
and
subjected
to
a
ruling
cross-examination
that
they
constantly
hammered
with
all
these
incompetent
statements
had
been
made.
the
jury
found
that
that
did
not
--
that
walker
did
not
assume
command
of
that
crowd.
that
he
did
not
lead
any
charge
against
the
united
states
marshals.
now,
i
don't
know
any
other
way
to
establish
such
a
fact
except
to
try
it
in
two
cases
before
a
jury.
now,
we're
dealing
not
with
--
whether
this
language
was
intemperate,
whether
it
thrust
him
in
the
vortex
of
controversy.
anything
else
we're
dealing
with
first
the
question,
did
he
command
that
crowd
and
did
he
lead
the
charge?
was
he
falsely
accused
of
a
crime
or
was
he
actively
accused
of
crime.
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
sir,
he
testified
repeatedly
in
many
other
ways.
he
has
testified
that
he
arrived
and
he
would
describe
graphically
in
this
big
texas
has
walked
around
the
whole
campus
very
slowly
and
let
the
students
came
up
and
said,
“here's
general
walker.
general
walker
your
leader.
general
walker
is
not
afraid
of
them.”
he
absolutely
refused
to
have
any
connection
with
them
whatever.
their
witness,
after
witness,
after
witness
that
testified
as
i
started
to
answer
your
cases
to
your
question
a
moment
ago
that
he
came
on
the
mississippi
campus
from
his
--
there's
a
chart
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
it's
been
oriented
by
the
circle
being
around
the
confederate
monument
with
the
lyceum
in
the
west,
300
yards
away
from
the
confederate
monument.
he
came
on
the
campus,
walk
around
in
the
area
of
the
monument
for
a
while,
came
on
to
the
flagpole
which
is
half-way
to
the
lyceum,
moved
over
the
football
field
then
he
went
back.
there's
a
highway
patrol
started
to
leave
and
someone
said,
“governor
barnett
sold
us
out”.
and
then
for
the
first
time,
for
the
purpose
of
quieting
the
students
down,
he
said
governor
barnett
has
not
sold
you
out.
this
is
not
the
place
for
violence.
violence
was
not
in
hand
because
our
real
enemies
are
over
there
in
cuba.
that's
what
he
actually
did.
and
when
he
got
down
of
the
monument,
he
walked
around
again.
now
here
is
the
direct
conflict
of
evidence.
this
young
reporter,
as
i
told
you,
told
on
reporters
on
the
telephone
that
walker
arrived
on
the
campus,
made
a
the
speech
and
led
the
charge
against
the
u.s.
marshals.
across
the
north
side
of
the
open
which
run
this
east
from
west.
these
four
star
witness
of
the
associated
press
with
a
picture
reverend
dunkin
gray,
who
was
all
over
the
area
all
the
time
from
the
time
walker
arrived
on
the
campus
until
walker
made
a
speech
on
the
monument.
reverend
dunkin
gray
said
there
was
no
such
charge
of
the
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
sir,
the
reason
he
made
the
speech
and
his
testimony
is
explicit
on
this
under
direct
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright,
sir.
alright,
he
maybe
--
the
word
lasting
general
walker
wanted
was
violence
because
he
wanted
it
to
appear
absolutely
unnecessary
to
bring
26,000
troops
to
mississippi.
he
felt
it
should
have
been
in
cuba
and
that
was
his
argument
across
the
board.
and
counsel
made
a
statement
that
he
was
a
racist.
general
walker
has
absolutely
no
background
and
there
is
not
one
single
on
the
record
that
walker
in
anyway
is
involved
in
any
racial
conflict.
now,
that
is
the
statement
that
i
have
submitted
completely
outside
the
record.
he
did
not
go
there
for
a
racial
purpose.
he
was
there
solely
to
protest
what
he
said,
was
used
a
military
force
to
the
type
of
military
that
he'd
lived
with.
that
were
--
as
much
as
his
life
as
his
very
sole
and
his
brain
itself.
he
went
there
for
protest.
taking
young
americans
and
using
him
against
their
fellow
americans.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
there
are
many
people
have
advanced
into
many
areas
to
protest
what's
going
on.
we
said
everyday
or
someone
comes
in
and
make
a
protest.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
said,
may
i
hid
in
the
protest
after
i
excuse
of
the
law
by
my
concept
sir.
what
he
was
protesting
was
the
use
of
troops
and
that's
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
again,
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
as
an
american
citizen
and
under
debate
robust
uninhibited
wide
open
which
at
some
--
sometimes
can
be
costly
given.
he
was
entitled
i
believe
as
american
citizen
to
appear
there
and
say,
“now
i
think
it's
wrong
for
my
presence
to
use
the
troops
to
whom
i
have
served,
to
come
in
to
mississippi
when
they're
ought
to
be
in
cuba.”
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
about
that,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
one
of
our
witnesses,
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i'm
familiar
with
that
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
say
about
that,
sir.
that
was
an
unsworn
statement,
an
unsworn
statement
of
this
witness
that
were
procured
by
the
associated
press.
we
forced
the
witness
to
come
to
trial
under
oath.
he
stood
there
under
the
absolutely
merciless
cross-examination,
one
of
the
greatest
trial
lawyers
of
the
southwest
and
convinced
that
jury
to
take
out
that
unsworn
statement
out
of
him.
that
he
was
with
general
walker
every
minute
from
the
time
he
arrived
on
the
campus
from
the
time
he
left
and
had
no
time,
the
--
the
general
walker
participate
one
hour
in
the
activities
of
the
crime.
the
jury
heard
this
same
witness
when
he
was
confronted
with
these
unsworn
statements.
i
heard
him
answer
news
in
the
record
and
i
will
guarantee,
sir,
that
that
was
his
answer
to
that
statement
to
the
satisfaction
of
that
jury
who
were
completely
and
totally
convinced
that
this
was
an
absolute
fabrication
solely
for
the
purpose
of
selling
news
about
general
walker
assuming
command
this
mob
and
led
a
charged.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
denied
his
speech
it.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
he
admitted
having
made
the
statement
to
attorneys
who
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
denied
the
facts
under
oath
extensively
under
the
most
vicious
--
i
wouldn't
say
vicious,
but
under
the
most
impressive
i'll
say,
cross-examination
i've
ever
seen
put
on
the
courtroom
by
a
man
who
knows
how
to
cross-examine.
and
with
that
statement
before
the
jury
with
this
witness
having
confronted
with
that
statement,
he
sat
there
and
looked
the
jury
in
the
eyes
which
no
representative,
no
employee
of
the
associated
press
did
and
he
convinced
that
jury
that
they
work
that
statement
out
of
him
and
it
was
not
true.
now,
that's
about
his
step
of
a
trial
proposition,
if
you
can
present
in
a
court
of
justice
alone.
i
submit
respectfully
if
the
issues
in
this
case
have
been
weighed
in
the
scales
of
justice,
they
have
been
tried
in
the
exclusive
of
adversary
conflict
twice
in
baltimore
and
i
do
not
understand
if
the
prerogative
of
an
appellate
court
and
this
court
have
well
stated
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
this
is
the
record,
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
in
that
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
do
not
think
so,
sir,
because
i
say,
this
was
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
this
was
a
gratuitous
statement
by
the
court
in
a
letter
to
counsel
in
which
he
stated
his
stories.
he
never
--
he
made
no
stories
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
if
you
--
if
want
sir
i
consider
in
connection
with
the
fact.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh,
well
if
something
that
court
was
carefully
consider
and
then
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
your
honors
own
target
is
a
very
tough
question.
now,
if
the
court
had
said,
that
if
sullivan
applies,
there
is
no
actual
malice.
the
court
had
said
that.
under
--
if
the
court
has
said,
let's
make
it
specific.
if
the
court
had
said,
“under
the
sullivan
rule,
we
find
there's
no
actual
malice.of
course,
we
would
be
out.”
but
then
i
suggest
your
honor
that
it's
up
for
this
court
to
find
out
what
lower
courts
did.
the
courts,
lower
courts,
left
in
the
record
a
specific
finding
by
this
jury
undisturbed
carefully
reviewed
by
the
trial
court,
by
two
appellate
courts
a
specific
finding.
do
you
find
that
the
statement
represents
the
honest
opinion
on
the
record?
now,
if
that's
still
in
there
even
though
they
did
execute
initial
talk,
even
--
unless
they
gone
home
own
to
hold.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
right.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
because
we
--
because
in
the
language
of
the
trial
court,
we
did
not
prove
that
this
statement
was
made
that
they
aware
or
within
entire,
not
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
but
with
entire
more
won't
care.
and
that
was
a
result
of
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
right
and
welfare
of
the
parties.
now,
the
ruling
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
i
think
if
the
appellate
--
even
if
any
of
the
three
courts
in
texas
had
in
handed
the
full
of
rug
out
one
of
the
jury's
finding
as
this
was
knowingly
false
and
in
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
they
would
have
--
let
say
would
have
rescind
it
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
they
would
have
set
aside
the
whole
verdict.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
that
would
be
--
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
a
judgment
as
distinguished
in
conversation.
in
simple
language
that
we're
dealing
with
and
in
resolving
these
things,
every
complicated
question
has
a
simple
action
and
the
simple
action
i
can
see
is
of
course
was
talking
and
not
working.
and
they
actually
entered
an
order
finding
that
there
is
no
sullivan
tagged
malice.
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
why
they
merely
entered
in
the
statement
and
by
way
of
a
letter
that
he
did,
i
do
not
consider
that
as
in
anyway
affecting
this
specific
finding
that
this
was
not
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer
and
was
not
published
in
good
faith.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
and
when
the
news
media,
it
relieve
of
responsibility,
product
liability
for
his
news
product
that
is
sold
for
her,
the
minute
that
is
--
that
rule
is
accomplished
then
there
will
be
no
more
copies
in
the
press.
i
would
then
make
this
one
last
comment,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it
would
be
very
brief.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
that
one
thing
i
can
do
is
get
brief.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
know
of
not
--not
if
i'm
a
texas
lawyer
but
i
know
of
no
such
customs.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it's
just
an
expression
to
counsel
of
the
court's
opinion.
now
the
court
said
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
it
was
direct
to
the
counsel
as
i
say
the
court
is
talking
and
not
deciding.
that
is
applied
in
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
don't
think
undoubted
it
was.
yes,
sir.
now,
i
was
going
to
make
this
last
comment.
if
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
it's
something
that
this
court
she
--
she
look
and
i'm
sure
will
consider.
but
it
is
not
a
judgment
finding
that
the
special
issues
that
are
left
in
the
case
were
improperly
returned
for
the
jury.
and
i
have
this
--
any
judge
in
texas
made
a
finding
that
we
vacate
special
findings.
as
i
remember
the
1,
3,
and
5
that
find
falsely.
it
finds
that
it
is
not
that
honest
opinion
of
the
writer
and
it
is
not
published
in
good
faith.
had
any
of
these
courts
which
had
the
responsibility,
the
judicial
responsibility,
of
weighing
the
evidence
had
bound
there
was
no
such
evidence
rather
than
just
talking
which
they
did,
they
had
some
embarrassment
--
embarrassing
conversation.
but
i
submit
respectfully
to
this
honorable
court,
that
it
is
conversation
and
not
judgment
and
if
the
record
is
overwhelmed
that
this
man
that
said,
i
saw
walker
assumed
command
of
the
mob
and
led
the
charge
from
six
feet,
didn't
see
it.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
could
i
respectfully
call
your
honor's
attention
to
page
1229.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
appreciate
that
sir
very
much.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
a
participant
in
this
legal
conflict
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
the
doctors
have
a
rule
that
they
never
operate
members
of
the
family.
perhaps
lawyer
should
have
a
rule
that
they
should
not
participate
in
cases
in
which
the
two
closely
involved.
at
the
inception
of
this
litigation
or
of
this
argument,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
have
known
this
man
as
a
classmate
and
as
a
fellow
soldier
for
too
long.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
and
if
i
make
some
suggestions
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
it
does.
there's
--
i
just
apologizing
in
advance.
i
don't
intend
to
get
off
in
these
areas
and
i,
in
advance,
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
i
do
it's
an
error
of
the
mind
and
not
of
the
heart.
now
first,
the
issues
in
this
lawsuit,
although
apparently
complicated,
are
essential
in
sense.
as
counsel
stated
the
basic
issue
is
whether
there
is
an
immunity
upon
the
press
in
this
case,
falsely
to
accuse
a
man
of
crime.
by
our
concept,
the
action
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
--
that
is
our
contention.
oh!
that
is
their
contention.
yes
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that
is
the
effect,
sir,
of
the
argument
primarily
of
the
amicus
curiae
and
essentially
of
the
associated
press.
in
this
case,
unlike
any
reported
case
before
this
honorable
court
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
because
the
new
york
times
case
did
not
involve
the
charge
of
crime.
in
this
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
not
as
such
as
i
get
garrison.
the
issue
i
am
endeavoring
to
submit
and
suggest
to
your
honors
is,
that
this
court
is
now
plowing
out
the
perimeter
as
have
built
--
been
well-stated
by
the
authors
of
new
york
times
of
the
rule
of
that
case
extending
immunity
to
the
press,
threading
along
the
boundary
between
the
freedom
of
the
individual
from
accusa
--
from
false
accusation
and
false
defamation
as
distinguished
from
the
freedom
of
the
press
to
timely,
to
accurately,
and
timely
report
the
news.
now,
that
is
the
responsibility
and
it
is
a
somewhat
of
an
awesome
responsibility
that
now
rest
upon
the
shoulders
of
this
court,
to
fit
the
perimeter
in
a
manner
in
which
the
citizen
will
not
be
troubled
by
an
all
powerful
press
in
endeavoring
to
make
this
position
known
by
a
freedom
on
the
part
of
the
press
to
accuse
him
falsely
of
the
commission
of
crime.
now,
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
an
accusation
against
this
man
that
promptly
resulted
in
his
incarceration
in
a
federal
mental
institution.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
legal
issues
have
been
summarized
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
associated
press.
i
will
go
down
those
issues
for
brevity
and
simplicity,
the
time
is
short,
in
order
to
spotlight
before
this
honorable
court
the
issues
as
i
comprehended.
the
first
statement
that
is
made
in
the
reply
brief
is
that
walker,
in
attempts
to
create
the
impression
that
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
a
felony
and
separate
various
other
humiliations
as
a
direct
and
proximate
result
of
news
reports.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
first
associated
press
news
release
on
page
1229
of
the
record,
wherein
at
now
in
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that
is
volume
3
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir,
page
1229
of
the
record.
under
a
release
time
of
9:20
that
the
court
rule
recognized,
at
the
bottom
of
page
1222
--
i
as
you
are
page
1230,
with
release
time
of
9:20,
the
associated
press
reported
that
this
man
had
assumed
command
of
the
a
mob
and
he
led
a
charged.
the
reporter
who
issued
that
news
release
was
listed
upon
the
government's
complaint,
in
this
case,
as
having
furnished
information
upon
which
this
man
was
thrown
in
jail
and
a
fantastic
course
of
events
that
thereof
occurred
illustrates
graphically
and
dynamically
to
this
court,
the
potential
nuclear
impact
of
a
--
an
extreme
power
of
the
press
to
falsely
--
to
accuse
the
man
falsely
of
a
crime.
now
this
man
was
siezed
taken
before
a
united
states
commission
ordered
to
be
confined
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
the
custody
of
the
marshal
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
within
an
hour
a
telegram
arrived
from
the
department
of
justice,
directing
his
transportation
to
springville,
missouri.
and
without
a
court
order,
without
notice,
without
counsel,
without
a
hearing,
this
man
who
is
tried
and
admitted
to
a
prison,
mental
hospital,
in
defiance
of
almost
of
every
right
known
to
the
constitution
and
the
law
books
of
this
great
man.
the
next
day,
upon
an
affidavit
of
a
psychiatrist
who
had
never
seen
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
said
this
was
triggered
by
the
release
at
9:25
on
the
evening
of
the
riot.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
immediately
on
the
reporter,
sir,
who
made
the
release,
appeared
on
the
government's
complaint
as
the
witness
furnishing
the
information
upon
which
walker
is
incarcerated.
so
the
issue
i'm
endeavoring
to
present
to
this
honorable
court
is
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
if
your
honor
would
turn
to
the
answer
to
amicus
curiae
brief
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it's
page
7
of
the
appendix.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
page
7,
the
amicus
answer
to
amicus
curiae
brief
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
i
don't
remember
whether
that
was
specifically
entered
in
the
trial
or
not.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
those
facts
were
all
over
the
trial,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
couldn't
say
it
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
if
my
recollection,
i
won't
to
be
--
i
want
to
recheck
and
answer
your
honor's
question
precisely.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright,
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
to
answer
your
question,
sir.
i
have
rechecked
the
record.
i
have
tried
two
of
these
very
extensive
lawsuits
and
when
i
rechecked
my
mental
process,
when
counsel
referred
to
louisiana
case
that
is
specifically
in
the
record
of
louisiana
case.
in
the
texas
case,
it
is
not
in
the
trial
record.
i
presented
in
my
brief
solely
as
an
example
of
what
can
happen
to
an
individual
citizen,
if
the
press
is
free
to
accuse
him
falsely
with
a
crime.
that's
the
answer
to
that.
now
sir,
i
was
discussing
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
he
was
arrested.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
given
into
the
custody
of
the
u.s.
marshal
for
confinement
by
court
order
in
mississippi.
without
a
court
order
on
that
on
a
telegram
from
the
department
of
justice,
he
would
put
on
the
motor
patrol
plane,
not
told
where
it
was
going.
on
a
pursuant
to
an
affidavit
from
a
psychiatrist
in
washington
who
had
never
seen,
said
he
read
news
reports.
and
he
was
shipped
to
springville,
missouri,
prison
mental
hospital,
in
an
atmosphere
of
criminal
insanity.
the
next
day,
without
notice
counsel
or
hearing,
an
order
was
signed
committing
there
for
the
period
that
it
took
to
examine
which
developed
within
90
days
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
this
is
not
heard.
they
just,
sir,
asked
me
all
that
what
happened.
i
was
just
outlining.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
no,
sir.
that
--
as
i
remember
now,
that
could
have
been
involved
in
the
louisiana
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
and
in
the
texas
case.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it
was
excluded.
the
court
had
no
rule
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
relationship
with
the
acts
of
incidents
between
walker
and
the
government
of
the
texas
case.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
as
claim,
sir
that
the
associated
press
triggered
the
course
of
events
which
resulted
in
this
fantastic
situation.
they
on
the
night
of
september
30,
and
prior
to
the
reply
brief
of
the
associated
press.
and
on
the
night
of
september
30,
they
issued
the
new
release
at
9:25,
that
walker
had
assumed
command
of
the
crowd
and
led
the
charge.
now,
as
mr.
--
my
brother
rogers
has
outlined
has
been
tried
in
two
cases,
two
juries
upheld
that
he
did
not
lead
the
charge.
now,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
he
was
order
to
be
held
after
90
days.
i
finally
got
him
out
at
the
end
sixth
day
by
going
back
to
mississippi.
i
couldn't
even
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
what
i
say
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
what
happened
in
this
case,
sir?
the
associated
press
said
that
he
had
committed
the
crimes
of
insurrection,
sedition,
seditious
conspiracy,
and
assaulting
u.s.
officers.
immediately
he
was
arrested.
he
was
seized
and
taken
to
the
prison
mental
hospital
in
springville,
missouri,
without
notice
for
counsel
and
hearing
and
on
an
affidavit
of
the
psychiatrist
who
had
never
seen
him.
now
that
was
only
direct
and
approximate
result,
sir,
of
the
false
news
report
that
can
happen
when
the
news
media
has
no
intention
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
nature
of
damages
in
this
case.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
but
it's
relevant
only
to
the
extent
of
illustrating.
what
can
happen
to
an
american
citizen
when
--
who
is
exercising
his
right
of
freedom
of
free
speech,
when
the
newspapers
uninhibited
by
financial
responsibility
from
accusing
him
falsely
of
a
crime.
i
offered
solely
sir
as
an
illustration
of
what
can
happen
under
the
rule
demanded
by
the
press
in
this
case
and
to
freedom
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
charged
with
sedition,
assault
of
the
u.s.
office
--
officers,
insurrection
and
seditious
conspiracy.
four
crimes
that
he
had
take
the
self
--
he's
a
combat
soldier
in
the
united
states
army
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution
in
united
states.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
grand
jury
dismissed
the
charge.
refused
to
indict,
the
government
dismissed
the
charges.
and
there
as
i
show
in
this
case
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
in
mississippi,
yes,
sir.
as
i
say
and
have
presented
to
this
honorable
court,
in
the
briefs
the
associated
press
gamble
for
the
highest
stakes
known
to
human
conflict,
the
reputation
and
liberty
of
an
american
citizen.
they
gamble
for
extensive
financial
profit
by
presenting
around
the
world
on
their
war
services.
the
intelligence
of
this
man,
a
former
general
officer
in
the
united
states
army,
had
to
assume
command
of
a
rag
tag,
band
of
students,
and
had
led
the
charge
on
the
government
that
he
had
sworn
to
defend
against
all
enemies,
foreign
and
domestic.
now,
that
was
not
passed
around
the
world
for
profit
service
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
here
by
my
concept
of
it,
i
--
those
statements
are
enforced.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
regret
them
but
i
do
not
believe
they
could
have
triggered
them,
sir,
because
they
were
not
a
crime.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
they
were
not
a
crime.
in
other
words,
that
was
an
argument
that
general
walker
had
very
vehemently
and
acoustically
presented
but
it
was
not
he
accused
no
other
crime.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
has
the
associated
press
falsely
accused
walker
of
a
crime?
if
they
have
or
they're
privilege
under
the
constitution
to
accuse
a
man
of
crime
when
they
--
when
their
report
says,
“i
saw
walker
led
the
charge
from
a
distance
of
6
feet.
and
when
walker
answered,
“did
you
really
saw
me
or
you
didn't?
if
you
saw
me,
i
am
guilty
of
a
crime.
i've
been
properly
charged.
if
you
didn't
see
me,
i
have
been
falsely
accused.”
now,
that's
the
issue
and
we're
--
as
much
as
i
regret,
the
incompetent
statements
that
were
made,
sir,
and
i
sincerely
regret
them.
but
that
is
a
collateral
issue
that
as
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court,
has
been
injected
into
this
lawsuit
for
the
purpose
or
for
its
obvious
purpose.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that's
i
what
i
was
--
and
then
they
were
just
--
the
fact.
i
appreciate
that
sir.
my
time
is
short
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
number
one,
the
associated
press
has
had
every
advantage
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
they
have
had
every
advantage
of
the
rule
of
the
sullivan
case.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
request
the
jury
under
texas
special
issue
proceeding.
did
you
--
do
you
find
that
this
report
was
knowingly
false
or
in
reckless
disregard
of
truth?
they
elect
the
places
to
refrain
from
making
such
a
request.
under
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure,
when
they
make
no
such
request,
they
wait.
now,
here
is
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
was
made
actually
more
onerous
to
the
plaintiff
than
is
sullivan
had
said.
and
the
jury
was
instructed
in
the
definition
of
fair
comment.
here
instructed
that
by
said
term
has
made
a
statement
that
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that's
an
informal
letter.
yes,
sir.
it
did
--
it
did
not
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
well,
i
--
i
construe
it's
just
the
letter
to
counsel.
it
was
never
entered
down
the
record
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i'm
glad
you
already
answered
that
question
because
that
is
rather
on
target
on
the
--
really
the
only
issue
in
the
lawsuit.
there
was
no
evidence
of
actual
malice
as
defined
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
as
defined
by
the
texas
law
and
is
outlined
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
am
going
to
outline
that
here
sir.
that
the
court
vacated
the
punitive
damages
finding.
and
here
is
the
--
the
finding
of
his
record.
do
you
find
that
the
report
was
actuated
by
malice
as
the
term
is
defined?
definition:
“malice
is
meant
ill
will,
bad
or
evil
motive;
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
right
or
welfare
of
a
person.”
now,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
not
a
definition
of
sullivan
type
of
malice.
the
court
also
interrogated
the
jury,
“do
you
find
--
and
this
was
a
finding
that
remained
in
the
case.
it
was
not
disturbed
by
any
texas
court.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
don't
construe
it
that
way.
he
said
that
new
york
times
doesn't
apply.
therefore,
it
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that's
the
question
i
was
about
to
address
myself
to
moment
ago.
the
court
actually
in
under
special
issues,
one
and
five,
told
this
jury
that
fair
comment
is
a
statement
which
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
now,
that
is
the
ultimate
that
can
be
demanded
by
the
news
media
under
new
york
times.
in
other
words,
the
associated
press,
every
option
in
the
trial
of
this
case
to
demand
a
special
issue
of
this
jury,
do
you
find
that
this
publication
was
in
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth
or
was
knowingly
false?
the
associated
press
selected
not
to
do
that,
why?
because
the
special
issue
i
presented
into
the
jury
was
even
more
difficult
for
the
plaintiff
than
was
new
york
--
the
new
york
times
rule.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
sir
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
solely
--
solely
sir,
as
to
express
malice
for
the
purpose
of
punitive
damages
which
is
i
have
outlined.
there
is
a
vast
distinction
under
texas
law
of
expressed
malice
for
punitive
damage
and
sullivan
type
malice
which
is
knowingly
false
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
we
do
have
too
many
cases
too
long
i
have
seen
judge
has
go
on
and
comment
on
many
things
that
we
can
refer
to
as
dicta.
and
frankly
to
me,
sir,
that
is
dicta
that
he
used
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
that
is
it
dicta
so
that
the
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
the
new
york
times
rule
was
made.
when
the
judge
--
here's
the
point
i
am
endeavoring
to
get
over
to
the
court.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
in
framing
the
issues,
this
defendant
was
perfectly
contempt
to
rely
on
the
definition
of
fair
comment
as
given.
do
you
find
that
this
report
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer?
the
jury
said,
“no”.
do
you
find
that
this
report
was
published
in
good
faith?
now,
there's
no
rule
under
new
york
times
and
those
findings
placed
here
remain
in
the
record.
they
are
undisturbed
by
the
trial
court,
the
seventh
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
so,
we
now
confront
this
honorable
court,
confront
this
case
in
this
posture.
in
the
record
there
is
a
finding
that
this
report,
that
walker
assumed
command
of
the
mob
and
led
the
charge,
is
not
fair
comment
and
is
not
“the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer”.
in
other
words,
there
goes
a
man
who
has
said
in
a
news
report,
“from
a
distance
of
six
feet,
i
saw
walker
assumed
command
of
the
crowd
and
led
a
charge”.
the
jury
said,
“that
is
fault.
that
is
not
your
honest
opinion
at
that
time
you
wrote
it.”
the
jury
also
said,
it
is
--
it
was
not
published
in
good
faith.”
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
jury
found
a
deliberately
false
statement
because
the
--
in
the
special
issue
under
which
the
associated
press
was
contempt
to
present
this
case
to
the
jury
said,
they're
entitled
to
fair
comment
which
is
a
statement
that
represents
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no.
well,
i
think
his
comment
was
wrong
about
new
york
times.
so
i
think
he
got
off
into
an
area
that's
large
frankly
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
say
sir
that
in
the
first
place,
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
he
was
dealing
only
with
punitive
damage.
he
did
not
pass
upon
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
other
than
approve
it
the
other
special
issues.
and
he
approved
the
special
issues
and
said
this
was
not
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer.
that's
the
inevitable
fact
that
i
am
endeavoring
to
present
to
the
court.
so
my
first
contention
is,
gentlemen,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
that
the
plaintiff
--
the
defendant
has
had
every
benefit
of
new
york
times.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
as
to
my
recollection,
the
texas
counsel
had
unless
my
recollection
he
did.
i
know
we
intended
to
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh!
yes,
we
did
in
the
texas
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
lost
that
in
the
texas
court.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
right,
sustained
by
three
courts.
and
in
the
language
of
the
appellate
court,
the
appellee
had
failed
to
prove
malice
as
defined.
now
again,
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
definition
of
malice
that
was
ruled
out
and
the
court
held,
we
did
not
prove.
malice
is
meant
ill
will.
sullivan
does
not
involve
ill
will.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i'm
reading,
sir,
from
the
finding
--
finding
special
issue
number
8
in
page
about
58
of
the
record
or
on
page
22
of
my
brief.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
blue
brief.
malice
is
meant
l
ill
will,
bad
or
evil
motive,
have
that
entire
want
which
will
raise
to
believe
from
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
right
or
welfare
of
the
person
to
be
affected.
now,
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
that
we
had
not
through
that.
they
left
intact
in
our
ground
undisturbed.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
the
word
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
the
word
“conscious”,
if
your
honor
please?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
it
is
similar.
just
like
a
horse
is
similar
to
a
cow
but
a
horse
is
not
a
cow.
a
conscious
indifference
involved
an
element
of
evil
deliberate
design.
it
is
necessary
under
texas
law
to
get
punitive
damages.
that
court
held
that
we
have
not
proved
a
conscious
indifference.
but
your
honors
upheld
that
if
you
prove
a
reckless
disregard
so
--
and
i'm
going
to
commend
your
honor
a
careful
evaluation
of
the
sullivan
rule.
creation,
as
i
heard
counsel
very
aptly
stated
this
morning
of
a
guideline
and
i
think
one
of
the
members
of
this
honorable
court
made
a
suggestion
to
that
guideline
were
indicated
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
this
court
now
is
involved
in
writing
a
guideline
that
will
fix
the
perimeter
between
the
freedom
of
the
individual
against
false
accusation
and
defamation
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
report
to
news.
and
i'm
here
to
cover
if
i
have
time
in
this
issue
that
when
the
issue
involved
is
false
accusation
of
a
felony,
the
press
improper,
the
press
in
constitution,
the
press
can
carefully
assume
a
standard
of
care
that
will
prevent
precipitous
false
accusation
of
a
crime
and
have
a
man
thrown
in
jail,
completely
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
the
press
charged
him.
and
in
simple
language,
it
is
the
design
of
the
constitution
to
the
united
states
of
america
at
the
press
report
the
news
and
not
makes
the
news
as
they
did
in
this
case.
they
have
a
basic
defect,
the
defect
in
this
lawsuit,
the
greatest
news
of
media
on
the
face
of
the
earth
was
absorbing
the
actions
of
this
unfortunate
event
in
oxford,
mississippi.
an
individual
arrived
there
who
have
previously
had
created
of
him
a
public
image.
everything
that
was
written
by
associated
press
expanded
that
public
image
as
a
criminal
lunatic.
we
perhaps
support
the
fact
that
the
united
press
reported
that
during
along
in
the
rioting,
general
walker
manned
the
confederate
statue
and
begged
the
students
to
avoid
violence.
now,
i'm
sure
your
honor
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
to
avoid
violence
which
is
absolutely
the
truth?
we
prove
to
everybody
the
overwhelming
evidence
and
general
walker
was
utmost
at
all
the
students,
a
protest
in
this
unfortunate
event
that
he
cautioned
the
student
to
avoid
violence.
now,
there
are
many
few
witnesses,
not
many
and
all
of
them
incidentally
were
members
of
the
news
media.
they
came
in
and
reported
that
they
heard
walker
versus
the
report
of
counsel
made.
he
say,
riot!
riot!
and
general
walker
like
myself
has
built
our
careers.
what
he
said,
“right,
right!
right,
right.”
when
there's
someone
asked
him
something
he
said,
“right!
right!”
well,
witness
has
heard
it
and
reporter
heard
it,
“riot!
riot!”
now,
that
shows
what
can
happen
after
a
no
restraint
on
the
news.
now,
what
i
desperately
hope
to
get
over
to
this
honorable
court
is
that
you're
dealing
with
news
as
a
commercial
commodity.
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
the
associated
press
as
recognized
by
this
honorable
court
in
its
opinion
in
associated
press
against
the
united
states.
there's
no
single
element
by
traditional
insistence
upon
equality
of
fair
trial
for
every
person
from
which
any
such
discriminatory
practice
can
stand.
member
of
the
publishers
of
the
associated
press
are
engaged
in
business
for
profit
exactly
as
our
other
businessmen
who
sell
food,
steel,
aluminum
or
anything
else
people
need
or
want.
the
fact
that
the
publisher
handle
his
news
while
others
handle
food
does
not
at
which
i'll
later
point
out
afford
the
publisher
a
peculiar
constitutional
sanctuary
in
which
he
can
with
impunity,
violate
laws
regulating
his
business
practices.
one
of
the
laws
that
regulate
the
practice
of
selling
the
news
is
that,
thou
shall
not
falsely
defame
or
accuse
thy
name.
now,
we're
dealing
in
this
case
as
your
--
as
this
honorable
court
has
recognized
many
times
where
a
public
debate
it
goes
to
the
very
essence,
the
very
foundation
of
the
survival
of
this
country.
the
question
is
to
what
extent
can
an
individual
citizen
debate
with
a
newspaper,
with
the
associated
press,
or
the
magazine.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
unless
coupled
with
the
fantastic
economic
power
of
the
associated
press
and
its
related
news
organs,
there
is
coupled
a
financial
responsibility,
the
news
that
those
people
sell
to
the
world
of
the
common
drug
on
the
market.
as
i
remember,
one
of
the
imminent
writers
in
the
early
days
of
this
great
country
of
ours,
made
a
comment
that
it
is
pureness
alone
that
gives
things
at
right.
what
we
obtained
too
chiefly,
too
chiefly
we
as
deem
to
life.
now
when
the
people
attained
a
new
product
and
this
is
a
commercial
product
that
is
not
based
upon
the
financial
integrity
of
the
manufacturers
of
that
product,
if
the
court
please,
the
confidence
of
the
american
people
in
the
news
media
that
represents
them
or
be
completely
wiped
away
and
the
credibility
gap
will
extend
so
completely
that
the
people
will
believe,
in
nothing
they
read
and
nothing
they
hear.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
honorable
court
that
the
greatest
disservice
that
could
possibly
done
by
the
associated
press
in
this
case
is
to
permit
them
to
manufacture
and
sell
news
without
the
trademark
of
their
responsibility
behind
it.
now,
that's
the
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
now
as
to
the
effects
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
had
they
said
he
assume
command
of
the
crowd.
i
have
very
carefully
outlined
all
the
issues
in
this
case
are
on
the
efforts.
incidentally
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
he
did
not.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
that's
part.
then
he
assumed
command
of
the
crowd
and
led
the
charge.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
now,
i
have
analyzed
in
the
utmost
detail
in
the
evidence
of
this
case,
it
is
more
than
conflict.
it
is
overwhelming.
if
anyone
will
read
it,
the
general
walker
entered
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
in
the
part
of
the
crowd.
the
witnesses
testified
that
he
walked
towards
the
flagpole
which
was
in
the
center
of
the
circle
almost
the
length
of
a
football
field
the
lyceum.
the
evidence
is
also
so
completely
conflicting
that
this
young
cover
reporter
called
the
news
room
in
new
orleans
in
the
office
--
or
on
the
telephone.
he
said,
“i
have
seen
judge
walker
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
general
walker
come
on
this
campus
make
a
speech,
inflamed
the
crowd
and
led
the
charge.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
this
reporter
that
issued
the
charge
that
brought
the
charges.
incidentally,
he
was
the
only
one
of
six
newsmen
of
associated
press
on
the
campus
that
night
that
even
purported
to
have
seen
anything
of
this
kind.
the
associated
press
brought
to
court,
sir,
not
one
employee
of
the
associated
press.
they
brought
to
court
that
one
united
states
marshal.
not
one
highway
patrolman.
we
brought
a
highway
patrolman.
we
brought
a
reporter
from
the
new
york,
from
the
washington
star,
who
was
addressing
with
general
walker
on
the
campus
that
night.
no
one
in
the
world
that
we
have
seen
except
this
newsman
and
among
other
who
has
so
completely
conflicting
in
his
testimony
and
he
was
unworthy
of
belief.
no
one
else
has
ever
--
even
insinuated
that
general
walker
led
the
charge.
now
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
did
not
testify
in
this
case
except
for
not
kept
his
depositions
and
overdo
the
excerpt
covering
this.
they
brought
him
to
--
this
i
need
to
get
outside
the
record
that
counsel
i
just
refer
to
the
louisiana
case.
they
brought
him
to
louisiana.
the
judgment
there,
the
verdict
was
$3
million
because
we
had
actually
pled
for
$3
million.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
introduced
excerpts
with
deposition.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
sorry?
i
got
to
fill
here
and
place
in
this
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
could
find
it
if
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
i
just
take
look
--
take
a
little
bit
of
time.
but
i
offered
the
testimony
to
prove
respondeat
superior.
to
prove
that
the
order
of
this
police
report
that
said
from
a
distance
of
six
feet,
“i
saw
walker
lead
this
charge
so
i
know
such
thing.
i
also
offered
the
news
--
the
said
speech
of
the
associated
press
itself
which
preceded
the
argument.
it
said,
“here
is
the
story-events
available,
21,
associated
press
newsman.
he
was
there
and
saw
what
happened.
the
jury
held
he
was
there
but
he
didn't
see
what
he
said
he
saw.
now,
these
issues
have
been
litigated,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court.
thirdly,
i
mean
where
the
complete
opportunity
of
the
associated
press
to
prove
not
just
--
the
only
they
have
to
prove
was
that
this
was
the
honest
opinion
of
surveillance.
they
could
not
approve
--
they
could
not
prove
that
in
a
trial
that
i
submit
respectfully
to
this
court
was
eminently
fair
by
a
judge
who
took
and
look
up
our
effort
for
every
interest
that
the
associated
press
says.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
jury
was
out
as
i
remember
couple
of
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours.
may
be
more
but
they
were
out
of
substantial
length
of
time.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
the
--
the
special
issues
submitted
to
the
jury,
“do
you
find
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
there.
yes,
sir.
and
i
say
that
had
he
not
been
permitted
to
accused
of
a
crime
and
here,
i
better
get
minute
on
my
concept
of
the
sullivan.
i
think
the
sullivan
rule
has
a
wholesome
implication
to
help
the
news
media
report
confused
events.
but
i
feel
that
unless
the
sullivan
rule
is
implemented
with
financial
responsibility
where
they
assume
--
where
they
gamble
for
profit
upon
the
freedom
of
american
citizen
and
falsely
accuse
him
of
a
crime,
i
do
not
believe
then
that
they
are
entitled
to
any
different
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
your
honor
had
the
right
on
target.
i
could
speak
for
a
week
and
not
answer
anymore.
he
said,
“i
saw
walker
assume
command
of
the
mob
and
led
the
charge”.
the
jury
said,
“he
didn't”.
now
that
could
be
nothing
other
than
knowingly
false.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
if
it's
false.
what
the
jury
find
was
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
general
walker
stated
that
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright,
sir.
there
is
a
confederate
monument.
general
walker
said
that
he
arrived
on
the
campus.
so
he
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
he
said
he
went
there
because
he'd
command
and
led
the
mob.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
had
commanded
the
incident
--
the
situation
looked.
he
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
concept
of
using
armed
forces
for
political
purposes.
that
was
his
purpose
solely
in
this
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
--
general
walker,
if
i
could
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
not
opposing
--
he
was
not
opposing
the
presidential
decree.
he
objected
in
his
language
and
in
his
testimony
to
bring
26,000
troops
to
mississippi
from
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
who
sent
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh!
the
troops
were
sent
there
for
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
but
as
the
senate,
he
objected
and
his
objection
was
completely
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
as
a
former
commander
of
the
troops
that
are
brought
there,
he
knew
the
awesome
impact
of
sharp
federal
bandits
into
the
backs
of
helpless
civilians.
and
he
went
there
to
protest
26,000
troops
down
in
mississippi.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
he
asked
sir.
he
asked
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh,
no,
sir.
he
said
he
went
there
to
--
well,
not
in
so
many
terms.
he
said
he
went
there
to
protest
the
use
of
troops.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
that's
what
he
said,
he
went
there.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
he
didn't
say
he
went
there.
let's
say
i'm
standing
there.
i
act
his
actions,
“now,
gentlemen
just
what
is
your
purpose
in
going
to
mississippi?”
this
is
on
page
13
of
the
blue
brief.
“i
thought
it
was
absolutely
wrong
to
use
military
forces
--
troops,
american
troops
and
strictly
civilian
problem.
alright,
mr.
watts
let
him
finish
and
i
wanted
to
see
for
myself
exactly
what
happened.
i
wanted
know
first
hand
information.
i
did
not
trust
the
press
reporting
of
it.
in
any
forms,
since
i
have
been
in
law
and
i've
seen
that
exaggerated
out
of
all
proportions,
and
i
intended
to
see
for
myself.
now
his
testimony,
your
honor
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
there
was
some
more
testimony
on
the
record
but
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
and
--
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
what?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
in
those
--
even
--
what?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
now,
they
even
by
inference,
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
don't
so
construe
in
his
testimony.
and
he
testified
based
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
i
don't
get
unarmed
because
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
--
he
felt
very
keen
as
i've
suggested
as
a
soldier
that
this
was
a
misuse
of
military
problem
and
i
don't
consider
as
was
called
upon.
however,
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
lawsuit
was
tried
in
order.
in
other
words
sir,
they
tried
walker
in
place
of
crime
of
action.
the
jury
was
charged
of
finding
out
did
walker
lead
the
charge?
was
it
--
did
that
young
reporter,
when
he
led
that
charge,
was
he
honest
in
saying
that,
“i
saw
him
assume
command
and
lead
the
charge.
and
was
it
published
in
good
faith?
that's
what
the
jury
was
charged.
the
counsel
for
the
associated
press
just
saturated
the
record
for
these
unfortunate
and
inflammatory
statements.
and
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it
is
and
i
regret
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
suppose
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
agree
with
your
honor.
but
there
the
question,
did
he
assume
command
of
this
mob.
that
was
the
question.
and
we
proved
this
jury
conclusively,
sir,
that
he
did
not
assume
command
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
was
there.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
believe,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
the
jury
found
without
the
young
reporter
being
there.
the
found
that
walker
being
there
and
subjected
to
a
ruling
cross-examination
that
they
constantly
hammered
with
all
these
incompetent
statements
had
been
made.
the
jury
found
that
that
did
not
--
that
walker
did
not
assume
command
of
that
crowd.
that
he
did
not
lead
any
charge
against
the
united
states
marshals.
now,
i
don't
know
any
other
way
to
establish
such
a
fact
except
to
try
it
in
two
cases
before
a
jury.
now,
we're
dealing
not
with
--
whether
this
language
was
intemperate,
whether
it
thrust
him
in
the
vortex
of
controversy.
anything
else
we're
dealing
with
first
the
question,
did
he
command
that
crowd
and
did
he
lead
the
charge?
was
he
falsely
accused
of
a
crime
or
was
he
actively
accused
of
crime.
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
sir,
he
testified
repeatedly
in
many
other
ways.
he
has
testified
that
he
arrived
and
he
would
describe
graphically
in
this
big
texas
has
walked
around
the
whole
campus
very
slowly
and
let
the
students
came
up
and
said,
“here's
general
walker.
general
walker
your
leader.
general
walker
is
not
afraid
of
them.”
he
absolutely
refused
to
have
any
connection
with
them
whatever.
their
witness,
after
witness,
after
witness
that
testified
as
i
started
to
answer
your
cases
to
your
question
a
moment
ago
that
he
came
on
the
mississippi
campus
from
his
--
there's
a
chart
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
it's
been
oriented
by
the
circle
being
around
the
confederate
monument
with
the
lyceum
in
the
west,
300
yards
away
from
the
confederate
monument.
he
came
on
the
campus,
walk
around
in
the
area
of
the
monument
for
a
while,
came
on
to
the
flagpole
which
is
half-way
to
the
lyceum,
moved
over
the
football
field
then
he
went
back.
there's
a
highway
patrol
started
to
leave
and
someone
said,
“governor
barnett
sold
us
out”.
and
then
for
the
first
time,
for
the
purpose
of
quieting
the
students
down,
he
said
governor
barnett
has
not
sold
you
out.
this
is
not
the
place
for
violence.
violence
was
not
in
hand
because
our
real
enemies
are
over
there
in
cuba.
that's
what
he
actually
did.
and
when
he
got
down
of
the
monument,
he
walked
around
again.
now
here
is
the
direct
conflict
of
evidence.
this
young
reporter,
as
i
told
you,
told
on
reporters
on
the
telephone
that
walker
arrived
on
the
campus,
made
a
the
speech
and
led
the
charge
against
the
u.s.
marshals.
across
the
north
side
of
the
open
which
run
this
east
from
west.
these
four
star
witness
of
the
associated
press
with
a
picture
reverend
dunkin
gray,
who
was
all
over
the
area
all
the
time
from
the
time
walker
arrived
on
the
campus
until
walker
made
a
speech
on
the
monument.
reverend
dunkin
gray
said
there
was
no
such
charge
of
the
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
sir,
the
reason
he
made
the
speech
and
his
testimony
is
explicit
on
this
under
direct
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright,
sir.
alright,
he
maybe
--
the
word
lasting
general
walker
wanted
was
violence
because
he
wanted
it
to
appear
absolutely
unnecessary
to
bring
26,000
troops
to
mississippi.
he
felt
it
should
have
been
in
cuba
and
that
was
his
argument
across
the
board.
and
counsel
made
a
statement
that
he
was
a
racist.
general
walker
has
absolutely
no
background
and
there
is
not
one
single
on
the
record
that
walker
in
anyway
is
involved
in
any
racial
conflict.
now,
that
is
the
statement
that
i
have
submitted
completely
outside
the
record.
he
did
not
go
there
for
a
racial
purpose.
he
was
there
solely
to
protest
what
he
said,
was
used
a
military
force
to
the
type
of
military
that
he'd
lived
with.
that
were
--
as
much
as
his
life
as
his
very
sole
and
his
brain
itself.
he
went
there
for
protest.
taking
young
americans
and
using
him
against
their
fellow
americans.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
there
are
many
people
have
advanced
into
many
areas
to
protest
what's
going
on.
we
said
everyday
or
someone
comes
in
and
make
a
protest.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
i
said,
may
i
hid
in
the
protest
after
i
excuse
of
the
law
by
my
concept
sir.
what
he
was
protesting
was
the
use
of
troops
and
that's
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
again,
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
as
an
american
citizen
and
under
debate
robust
uninhibited
wide
open
which
at
some
--
sometimes
can
be
costly
given.
he
was
entitled
i
believe
as
american
citizen
to
appear
there
and
say,
“now
i
think
it's
wrong
for
my
presence
to
use
the
troops
to
whom
i
have
served,
to
come
in
to
mississippi
when
they're
ought
to
be
in
cuba.”
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
about
that,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
one
of
our
witnesses,
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i'm
familiar
with
that
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
say
about
that,
sir.
that
was
an
unsworn
statement,
an
unsworn
statement
of
this
witness
that
were
procured
by
the
associated
press.
we
forced
the
witness
to
come
to
trial
under
oath.
he
stood
there
under
the
absolutely
merciless
cross-examination,
one
of
the
greatest
trial
lawyers
of
the
southwest
and
convinced
that
jury
to
take
out
that
unsworn
statement
out
of
him.
that
he
was
with
general
walker
every
minute
from
the
time
he
arrived
on
the
campus
from
the
time
he
left
and
had
no
time,
the
--
the
general
walker
participate
one
hour
in
the
activities
of
the
crime.
the
jury
heard
this
same
witness
when
he
was
confronted
with
these
unsworn
statements.
i
heard
him
answer
news
in
the
record
and
i
will
guarantee,
sir,
that
that
was
his
answer
to
that
statement
to
the
satisfaction
of
that
jury
who
were
completely
and
totally
convinced
that
this
was
an
absolute
fabrication
solely
for
the
purpose
of
selling
news
about
general
walker
assuming
command
this
mob
and
led
a
charged.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
denied
his
speech
it.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
he
admitted
having
made
the
statement
to
attorneys
who
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
he
denied
the
facts
under
oath
extensively
under
the
most
vicious
--
i
wouldn't
say
vicious,
but
under
the
most
impressive
i'll
say,
cross-examination
i've
ever
seen
put
on
the
courtroom
by
a
man
who
knows
how
to
cross-examine.
and
with
that
statement
before
the
jury
with
this
witness
having
confronted
with
that
statement,
he
sat
there
and
looked
the
jury
in
the
eyes
which
no
representative,
no
employee
of
the
associated
press
did
and
he
convinced
that
jury
that
they
work
that
statement
out
of
him
and
it
was
not
true.
now,
that's
about
his
step
of
a
trial
proposition,
if
you
can
present
in
a
court
of
justice
alone.
i
submit
respectfully
if
the
issues
in
this
case
have
been
weighed
in
the
scales
of
justice,
they
have
been
tried
in
the
exclusive
of
adversary
conflict
twice
in
baltimore
and
i
do
not
understand
if
the
prerogative
of
an
appellate
court
and
this
court
have
well
stated
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
this
is
the
record,
sir?
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
in
that
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
do
not
think
so,
sir,
because
i
say,
this
was
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
--
this
was
a
gratuitous
statement
by
the
court
in
a
letter
to
counsel
in
which
he
stated
his
stories.
he
never
--
he
made
no
stories
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes.
if
you
--
if
want
sir
i
consider
in
connection
with
the
fact.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
oh,
well
if
something
that
court
was
carefully
consider
and
then
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
your
honors
own
target
is
a
very
tough
question.
now,
if
the
court
had
said,
that
if
sullivan
applies,
there
is
no
actual
malice.
the
court
had
said
that.
under
--
if
the
court
has
said,
let's
make
it
specific.
if
the
court
had
said,
“under
the
sullivan
rule,
we
find
there's
no
actual
malice.of
course,
we
would
be
out.”
but
then
i
suggest
your
honor
that
it's
up
for
this
court
to
find
out
what
lower
courts
did.
the
courts,
lower
courts,
left
in
the
record
a
specific
finding
by
this
jury
undisturbed
carefully
reviewed
by
the
trial
court,
by
two
appellate
courts
a
specific
finding.
do
you
find
that
the
statement
represents
the
honest
opinion
on
the
record?
now,
if
that's
still
in
there
even
though
they
did
execute
initial
talk,
even
--
unless
they
gone
home
own
to
hold.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
alright.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
right.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
because
we
--
because
in
the
language
of
the
trial
court,
we
did
not
prove
that
this
statement
was
made
that
they
aware
or
within
entire,
not
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
but
with
entire
more
won't
care.
and
that
was
a
result
of
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
right
and
welfare
of
the
parties.
now,
the
ruling
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
no,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
sir,
i
think
if
the
appellate
--
even
if
any
of
the
three
courts
in
texas
had
in
handed
the
full
of
rug
out
one
of
the
jury's
finding
as
this
was
knowingly
false
and
in
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
they
would
have
--
let
say
would
have
rescind
it
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
they
would
have
set
aside
the
whole
verdict.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
that
would
be
--
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
a
judgment
as
distinguished
in
conversation.
in
simple
language
that
we're
dealing
with
and
in
resolving
these
things,
every
complicated
question
has
a
simple
action
and
the
simple
action
i
can
see
is
of
course
was
talking
and
not
working.
and
they
actually
entered
an
order
finding
that
there
is
no
sullivan
tagged
malice.
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
but
why
they
merely
entered
in
the
statement
and
by
way
of
a
letter
that
he
did,
i
do
not
consider
that
as
in
anyway
affecting
this
specific
finding
that
this
was
not
the
honest
opinion
of
the
writer
and
was
not
published
in
good
faith.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
and
when
the
news
media,
it
relieve
of
responsibility,
product
liability
for
his
news
product
that
is
sold
for
her,
the
minute
that
is
--
that
rule
is
accomplished
then
there
will
be
no
more
copies
in
the
press.
i
would
then
make
this
one
last
comment,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it
would
be
very
brief.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
that
one
thing
i
can
do
is
get
brief.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
know
of
not
--not
if
i'm
a
texas
lawyer
but
i
know
of
no
such
customs.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
it's
just
an
expression
to
counsel
of
the
court's
opinion.
now
the
court
said
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
it
was
direct
to
the
counsel
as
i
say
the
court
is
talking
and
not
deciding.
that
is
applied
in
--
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
don't
think
undoubted
it
was.
yes,
sir.
now,
i
was
going
to
make
this
last
comment.
if
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
yes,
sir.
it's
something
that
this
court
she
--
she
look
and
i'm
sure
will
consider.
but
it
is
not
a
judgment
finding
that
the
special
issues
that
are
left
in
the
case
were
improperly
returned
for
the
jury.
and
i
have
this
--
any
judge
in
texas
made
a
finding
that
we
vacate
special
findings.
as
i
remember
the
1,
3,
and
5
that
find
falsely.
it
finds
that
it
is
not
that
honest
opinion
of
the
writer
and
it
is
not
published
in
good
faith.
had
any
of
these
courts
which
had
the
responsibility,
the
judicial
responsibility,
of
weighing
the
evidence
had
bound
there
was
no
such
evidence
rather
than
just
talking
which
they
did,
they
had
some
embarrassment
--
embarrassing
conversation.
but
i
submit
respectfully
to
this
honorable
court,
that
it
is
conversation
and
not
judgment
and
if
the
record
is
overwhelmed
that
this
man
that
said,
i
saw
walker
assumed
command
of
the
mob
and
led
the
charge
from
six
feet,
didn't
see
it.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
could
i
respectfully
call
your
honor's
attention
to
page
1229.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
well,
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
clyde
j.
watts
i
appreciate
that
sir
very
much.
