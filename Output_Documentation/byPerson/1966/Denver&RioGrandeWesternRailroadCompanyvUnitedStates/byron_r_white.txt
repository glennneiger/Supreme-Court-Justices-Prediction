justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dempsey
does
the
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
none
of
the
–
that
no
control
problems
ever
developed
here.
that
the
greyhound
doesn't
acquire
any
more
stock
and
no
one
suggests
that
there
is
any
control
problem
within
section
5.
i
didn't
understand
the
government
at
this
point
to
say
that,
that
if
that
were
true
there
would
be
no
section
7
problem
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
let's
just
assume
there's
only
a
20%
acquisition
under
20a
do
you
understand
the
government
to
say
that
there
never
is
a
section
7
problem
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
government
says
including
now,
and
i'm
talking
about
the
about
the
commission
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
says
now
that
at
some
point
section
7
issues
–
that
the
section
7
issue,
anticompetitive
issue
does
have
to
be
faced
up
too
even
though
it
is
only
a
20%
acquisition
which
doesn't
represent
a
control
problem
under
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
be
put
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
you
and
the
government
are
now
together
in
terms
of
the
section
7
or
on
anticompetitive
impact
is
an
issue
under
20a?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
there
is
only
a
20%
acquisition
in
your
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
just
agreed
with
that
the
government
now
--
now
agree
that
section
7
was
an
issue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
does
right,
but
it
does
have
to
taken
into
consideration
--
justice
byron
r.
white
-–
to
prove
the
acquisition
to
court
at
some
point
in
connection
with
the
acquisition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
counsel
for
the
commission
is
on
this
brief
that
you
simply
accept
this
brief,
the
commission
brief
or
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
dempsey
let's
assume
that
the,
let's
assume
that
a
company
acquires
20%
of
the
competitor
and
the
antitrust
division
immediately
files
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
well,
they
announced
their
plans
to
acquire
and
they
acquire
--
file
a
suit
to
–
for
injunction
against
the
acquisition
and
move
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
the
court
turns
it
down.
does
--
i
don't
think
the
chances
of
violation
--
is
enough
to
warrant
holding
this
up
or
await
new
trial
on
the
merits.
now
that's
done
all
the
time
i
suppose
and
since
that,
why
is
this
just
like
the
commission
denying
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
saying,
we
are
going
to
wait
a
week,
we
get
all
the
evidence
in
and
then
we'll
decide
the
case,
maybe
we'll
have
to
take
it
part
again
but
or
maybe
we'll
have
to
freeze
the
holding
in
--
so
that
they
don't
have
voting
power
or
something
that
like.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
the
anticompetitive
consideration
come
in
under
section
5,
if
it
was
a
section
5
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
and
they
must
consider
the
anticompetitive
impact,
is
that
within
the,
is
that
in
connection
with
determining
the
public
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
you
contend
that
it
must
come
in
under
210a?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see,
i
really
don't
understand
why
you
think
you
have
the
better
case,
you
say
that
the
public
interest
includes
anticompetitive
consideration,
or
whether
you
say
that
it
does
[inaudible]
section
11
now,
it
says
[inaudible]
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
--
you
agree
that
--
do
you
agree
then
that
even
if
there
is
no
section
5
problem
in
the
sense
of
a
control
problem
that
if
rea
never
or
if
the
greyhound
never
acquires
any
more
stock
and
no
one
suggest
there
is
a
control
problem,
you
would
agree
that
there
is
still
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
purposes
of
section
7
or
section
20a,
one
of
the
other
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
would
agree
that
when
anyone
--
if
anyone
acquires
20%
of
the
competitor
that
there
is
a
--
that
there
is
some
order
of
the
section
7
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
call
it
20a
or
not
but
in
connection
with
the
20a
acquisition,
there
can
arrive
a
section
7
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
must
be
resolved?
justice
byron
r.
white
fundamental
of
that
proposition
though,
i
take
it
is
that
the
public
interest
as
used
in
section
20a
or
section
20
does
not
include,
does
not
have
to
include
any
anticompetitive
impact?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
public
interest
under
section
5
the
same
words,
those
same
words
do
include
anticompetitive
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
those
words
are
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
section
5
that
does
include
and
anticompetitive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
are
not
mentioned.
even
though,
anticompetitive
factors
are
not
expressly
mentioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
talk
about
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
concept
of
public
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
public
interests
were
construed
to
mean
under
section
20,
that
the
public
interest
meant
the
same
in
both
sections,
then
where
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
you
do.
you
say
you
can
--
you
can't
split
up
that
public
interest
matter
in
a
sense
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
will
certainly
approve
it
now,
will
approve
it
now
because
it's
consistent,
but
they
did
say
it's
consistent
with
the
public
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
--
you've
said
under
the
--
you've
said
that
public
interest
remains
the
same
thing
under
20
as
it
does
under
5
but
we
have
to
reverse.
so
that
seems
to
me,
to
me
to
say
that
the
commission
could
not,
i'm
not
saying
it
did
in
this
case,
the
commission
could
not
say
well
we
must
consider
a
competitive
impact
but
we're,
and
we
will
consider
it,
and
we
set
a
hearing
two
months
from
now
meanwhile
all
the
acquisition
may
go
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case,
in
this
case
it
said
it's
consistent
with
the
public
interest
which
if
it
includes
in
there
a
competitive
impact
they
haven't
considered
that
and
they're
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
do
it
another
way,
let
the
acquisitions
go
forward
and
then
we'll
consider
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
that
there
is
an
acquisition
under
section
20,
which
no
one
even
suggests
raises
any
control
problems
within
the
section
5.
at
some
point
in
every
such
acquisition
must
anticompetitive
consequences
being
considered.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
public
interest
under
20a
as
far
as
you're
concerned
doesn't
reach
any
of
the
competitive
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
aren't
any
competitive
consideration
in
that
finding
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
because
of
the
public
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
mean
as
it
appears
that
there's
some
serious
threat
or
some
likelihood
or
probability
of
a
control
for
that
antitrust
problem
or
competitive
problems.
if
that
appears
to
be
present
then
you
must,
you
think
you
must
differ
under
section
20
and
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
stock
issue,
that
the
commission's'
order
hasn't
been
challenged
at
all
and
the
acquisition
has
approved,
the
stock
was
issued
right
there,
when
would
the
rea
numbers
or
greyhound
numbers
go
on
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
immediately?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
contract
is
divested,
if
greyhound
goes
there
and
agreed
to
buy
the
stock
without
knowing
that
they
are
going
to
be
on
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
really
talking
about
immediately
issuing
the
stock
and
having
greyhound
representative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
right,
in
your
brief
of
course
--
it
would
ultimately
need
to
be
one
because,
because
you
would
sign
to
have
the
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dempsey
does
the
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
none
of
the
–
that
no

that
the
greyhound
doesn't
acquire
any
more
stock
and
no
one
suggests
that
there
is
any
control
problem
within
section
5.
i
didn't
understand
the

at
this
point
to
say
that,
that
if
that
were
true
there
would
be
no
section
7
problem
at

justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
let's
just
assume
there's
only
a
20%
acquisition
under
20a
do
you
understand
the
government
to
say
that
there
never
is
a

justice

so
the

and
i'm

about

the

says
now
that
at

that
the

it

as
far
as
you're
concerned
doesn't
reach
any
of
the
competitive
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
aren't
any
competitive
consideration
in
that
finding
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
because
of
the
public
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
mean
as
it
appears
that
there's
some
serious
threat
or
some
likelihood
or
probability
of
a
control
for
that
antitrust
problem
or
competitive
problems.
if
that
appears
to
be
present
then
you
must,
you
think
you
must
differ
under
section
20
and
section
5?
justice

well,
this
stock
issue,
that
the
commission's'
order
hasn't
been
challenged
at
all
and
the
acquisition
has
approved,
the
stock
was
issued
right
there,
when
would
the
rea
numbers
or
greyhound
numbers
go
on
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
immediately?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
contract
is
divested,
if
greyhound
goes
there
and
agreed
to
buy
the
stock
without
knowing
that
they
are
going
to
be
on
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
really
talking
about
immediately
issuing
the
stock
and
having
greyhound
representative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
right,
in
your
brief
of
course
--
it
would
ultimately
need
to
be
one
because,
because
you
would
sign
to
have
the
violation.
