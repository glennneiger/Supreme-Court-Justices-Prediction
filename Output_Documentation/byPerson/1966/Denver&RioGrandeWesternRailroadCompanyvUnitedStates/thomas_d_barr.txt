mr.
thomas
d.
barr
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
rea,
railway
express
agency.
there
are
two
transactions
involved
here.
first
one
is
the
sale
by
rea
to
greyhound
of
500,000
shares
of
stock,
which
represents
20%
of
rea
stock,
and
the
commission
has
authorized
rea
under
section
20a
to
issue
that
stock,
it
being
presently
unissued
and
to
sell
it
to
greyhound,
and
the
commission
has
found
that
rea
urgently
needs
the
$10
million
that
it
will
receive
from
greyhound.
the
second
transaction
which
is
also
involved
here
is
between
greyhound
and
rea
stockholders
and
i
include
the
appellant
railroads
as
among
those
stockholders
most
importantly.
immediately
after
the
sale
by
rea
to
greyhound,
greyhound
must
make
a
tender
offer
to
rea's
shareholders
to
buy
up
to
an
additional
40%
of
rea's
presently
outstanding
stock
and
that
offer
must
be
completed
within
60
days
after
the
offer.
one
possible
result
of
those
two
transactions
is
that
greyhound
will
ultimately
own
60%
of
rea
stock.
the
more
likely
result
is
that
the
appellant
railroads
will
and
they
have
said
very
clearly
several
times
that
they
will,
exercise
their
right
of
first
refusal
with
respect
to
the
40%
of
stock
that
greyhound
will
seek
on
the
tender
offer
and
that
they
because
they
already
own
10%
will
then
own
approximately
50%
of
rea
stock.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
your
honor
it
does,
they
do.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir,
it
is,
it's
in
the
standard
operating
agreement.
it's
not
in
the
agreement
between
rea
and
greyhound.
the
unissued
stock,
500,000
shares
of
stock,
that
are
not
issued
that
we
have
to
get
permission
from
the
commission
to
issue
are
not
subject
to
the
right
of
first
refusal
that's
why
they
can
go
through.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well
they
can't
do
that
your
honor,
but
they
can
prevent
the
stock
that
is
tendered
from
going
through
to
greyhound
by
exercising
the
right
of
first
refusal
after
it
has
been
tendered,
greyhound
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
you
don't
sir,
greyhound
will
offer
to
accept
tenders
up
to
40%
of
the
stock.
the
stockholders
will
then
make
the
tender
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
to
greyhound,
once
that
is
made,
all
of
rea's
other
stockholders
have
the
right
to
take
in
and
say
i'll
take
it
at
the
same
price.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
from,
no
your
honor.
they
have
that
right
as
among
themselves.
the
stock
may
not
be
sold
to
greyhound
without
being
in
effect
offered
to
all
the
other
stockholders
at
the
same
price
and
the
tender
offer
doesn't
cut
across
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
all
right
sir.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
that
in
the
record
as
among
any
other
party
your
honor.
there
is
of
course
a
third
possibility
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir
and
as
i
will
explain
to
you
in
just
a
moment
rea
is
rather
peculiar
kind
of
animal
in
that
respect
and
i
think
that's
very
important
now.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
there
is
a
third
possibility,
a
very
small
possibility
and
that
is
that
no
stockholder
will
tender
any
stock
to
greyhound.
this
i
say
is
very
unlikely
because
the
record
shows
that
the
holders
of
900,000
shares
of
rea
stock
have
already
indicated
that
they
will
tender,
that
they
will
either
sell
to
greyhound
or
to
the
southern
pacific
or
santa
fe,
the
appellants.
now
the
commission
has
properly
we
believe
postponed
consideration
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
appellants
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
until
the
results
of
this
tender
offer
known
60
days
after
the
first
sale
takes
place.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
doubt
about
that,
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
mr.
justice
fortas
that
greyhound
wants
to
buy
control
of
rea
and
wants
to
exercise
that
control
i
don't
contend
otherwise.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
is
not
defined
under
section
20
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
that's
under
section
5
and
it's
only
under
section
5
that
the
control
problems
can
be
raised.
section
20a
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
control.
all
section
20a
says
that
when
any
railroad
wants
to
issue
any
security
it
must
go
to
the
commission
and
obtain
permission.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
is
a
very
broad
definition,
control
or
power
to
control
and
the
cases
make
perfectly
clear
that
the
definition
is
a
very
broad
one
and
it
comes
down
to
something
like
the
power
to
influence.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir
there
is.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir,
there
is
and
i
plan
to
describe
that
at
some
length
and
let
me
answer
your
question.
this
agreement
was
negotiated
not
just
between
rea
and
greyhound.
it
was
negotiated
by
rea
with
its
58
railroad
stockholders
including
the
appellant
railroads,
who
are
part
of
the
negotiating
committee.
the
deal
went
through
several
offers
and
several
different
combinations
which
i'll
describe.
i
don't
think
anyone
gave
any
consideration
until
the
agreement
was
reached
as
to
what
the
appropriate
way
was
to
structure
the
agreement
in
order
to
put
it
to
the
commission
for
approval.
this
two-step
procedure
was
just
the
result
the
way
that
it
was
negotiated.
once
the
agreement
was
made
and
then
the
lawyers
focused
more
closely
on
what
was
the
appropriate
way
to
put
it
to
the
commission,
we
were
frankly
afraid
and
i
think
the
facts
that
i'll
recite
to
you
in
a
moment
will
show
you
why,
to
try
to
re-negotiate
the
deal
because
the
appellant
railroads
had
blocked
the
deal
twice
successfully,
we
were
afraid
to
give
them
another
opportunity
to
do
it.
it
seems
to
me
somehow
unfit
to
say
that
the
commission
should
send
it
back
to
rea
and
say
reform
the
deal
and
give
the
appellants
another
chance
to
block
the
deal
as
they
did
twice,
and
as
i'll
show
you
in
a
moment,
it
took
rea
ten
months
to
put
this
thing
together
but
it
just
didn't
seem
likely
to
us
that
we
could
reform
it
in
a
successful
way
without
perhaps
depriving
ourselves
with
the
money.
but
in
any
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
you
won't
find
any
statement
by
the
commission
to
that
effect
in
the
record
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir
you
won't
find
them
stating
expressly
that.
you
will
find
the
commission
there
is
something
i
think
in
the
record
and
i
misunderstood.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
commission's
reason
was
you
honor
that
it
said
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
consider
the
section
5
or
section
7
issues
at
this
time
and
that
appears
in
the
order,
which
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well
it
goes
on
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
the
commission
goes
on
that,
your
honor
please
after
it
makes
that
finding.
that
finding
appears
on,
on
page
198
of
the
record.
it
devotes
in
my
judgment
the
next
four
paragraphs
of
the
order
to
explaining
and
setting
forth
the
reasons
why
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
consider
the
section
5
problems
and
the
section
7
problem
at
that
time.
the
paragraph
that
includes
a
statement
is
the
paragraph,
the
last
full
paragraphs
on
198,
the
next
paragraph
deals
with
this
right
of
first
refusal
that
i've
just
described
to
you.
the
paragraph
after
that
describes
the
tender
offer.
the
paragraph
after
that
describes
the
way
that
rea
is
setup
and
so
on,
but
the
commission
doesn't,
if
your
honor
question
is
focused
directly
upon
should
we
have
this
thing
reformed,
the
commission
doesn't
focus
on
that.
one
of
the
reasons
it
doesn't
is
because
that
was
never
suggested
to
it
by
any
party
below.
the
suggestion
that
mr.
dempsey
makes
now
that
the
contract
could
have
been
reformed
is
a
suggestion
that
i
believe
is
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
it
was
certainly
not
made
to
the
commission.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
together
the
five
appellants
have
245,000
shares
of
stock
out
of
presently
outstanding
2
million,
so
they
have
a
little
more
than
10%
with
the
additional
500,000
that
would
be
issued
to
greyhound,
they
have
slightly
less
than
10%
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
is
certainly
oh!
yes
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
justice
fortas
at
page
40
and
41
of
the
record,
all
of
the
stock
holdings
of
all
the
stockholders
are
set
up
by.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
900
--
the
holders
of
900,000
shares
have
said
they
will
sell
their
stock
and
they
don't
care
who
they
sell
it
to.
they
will
sell
it
to
the
southern
pacific
in
the
sante
fe
if
they
exercise
their
right
of
first
refusal;
if
it
goes
through
that,
they
will
sell
it
to
greyhound.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
your
honor
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
dempsey
has
said
that
these
two
--
that
the
proper
line
of
commerce
here
is
express
service
and
that
rea
and
greyhound
together
have
about
95%.
we
say
and
we
said
only
tangentially
before
the
commission
that
the
proper
line
of
commerce
was
the
market
were
small
packages,
were
transportation
of
small
packages
and
that
we
had
about
2%
of
that
market
and
that
greyhound
had
1%.
there
has
been
no
attempt
whatsoever
your
honor
to
resolve
this
rather
large
difference
at
the
moment
between
mr.
dempsey
and
myself
and
that
will
have
to
be
resolved
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i'm
not
saying
that
the
commission
should
not
resolve
it.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
commission
properly
postpone
consideration
up,
that's
the
only
thrust
of
my
argument.
i
couldn't--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
is
still
something
that
has
to
be
resolved.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well,
i
don't
think
it
comes
under
section
20a
at
all
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
certainly
do
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
and
indeed
and
in
many
cases
your
honor
the
only
proper
to
way
to
do
it
is
to
do
it
all
at
once
and
i'm
not
saying
otherwise.
the
only
issue
here
between
us
is
really
a
pretty
simple
one.
the
appellants
say
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
approve
the
20a
application,
the
issuance
of
securities
and
to
postpone
consideration
of
the
section
5
problems
and
i'll
call
them
that
so
that
it's
clear
at
least
in
my
mind
what
i'm
talking
about
or
the
section
7
problems
to
postpone
consideration
of
those,
as
the
commission
said
this
is
not
the
appropriate
time,
this
order
is
only
under
20a
it's
not
to
be
taken
as
raising
any
presumption.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
quite
agree,
it
is
fundamental
and
i
take
that
position.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
words,
but
for
all
intents
and
purposes
there
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
the
public
interest
is
but
i
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well,
i
think
they
are
mr.
justice
white
because
it
requires
the
commission
under
section
5,
commission
is
required
to
take
into
consideration
the
impact
upon
other
carriers
in
making
its
determination
under
section
5.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir
but
i
always
thought
that
the
principal
impact
upon
other
carriers
would
be
the
competitive
impact,
but
in
any
case
this
court
has
made
clear
in
mclean
and
lately
in
the
seaboard
case
that
the
commission
must
take
the
--
within
the
policy
to
the
antitrust
law
-–
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir
under
section
5.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
then
you
reverse.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
if
no
–
excuses
me
–
if
what
you
say
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
if
you
say
that
the
commission
may
not
authorize
a
20a
approval
without
considering
the
anticompetitive
effects
and
if
this
court
holds
that,
that
the
public
interests
includes
that,
that
the
public
interest
in
20a
the
language
of
20a
includes
that
and
the
commission
has
not
done
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
say
that
section
20a
your
honor
in
this
i
think
mr.
rifkind
is
going
to
deal
with
this
more
fully,
but
i
say
the
20a
is
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
deal
only
with
the
physical
questions.
20a
was
passed
by
the
congress
in
1920
with
section
5.
section
5
is
setup
to
deal
with
the
control
questions
which
include
the
competition
question.
there
is
no
conceivable
reason
in
my
mind
why
you
should
say
that
if
the
congress
has
the
duty
under
section
5
to
do
all
of
these
things,
mr.
dempsey,
the
appellants
concede
that
the
principal
purpose
of
section
a
is
to
focus
on
these
problems
of
whether
there
is
stock
watering,
whether
there
is
the
value
behind
the
securities,
that's
what
section
20a
was
setup
to
deal
with.
the
appellants
concede
that's
the
principal
purpose,
but
they
say
that
a
subsidiary
purpose
is
to
reach
over
and
deal
with
all
the
problems
that
the
commission
is
required
to
deal
with
under
section
5.
now
i
say
you
can't
construe
the
statute
that
way
that
doesn't
get
rid
of
the
problems
in
any
way.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no,
your
honor
there
isn't
anything
that
actually
limits
it.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
isn't
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
in
anyway
suggests
to
me
that
it
is
supposed
to
consider
any
thing
other
than
what
i'll
call
the
stock
watering
problem.
you'll
recall
that
during
the
early
part
of
this
century,
the
railroads
were
notorious,
for
issuing
great
quantities
of
securities
behind
which
there
was
no
value
and
depriving
the
public
of
their
money
in
a
variety
of
ways.
now
in
1920,
we
didn't
have
a
securities
act
and
the
congress
after
the
commission
was
created
by
president
taft
and
this
commission
set
out
to
investigate
the
problem
of
stock
watering
and
the
problem
of
value
and
they
passed
section
20a
which
was
designed
to
make
the
carrier
come
to
the
commission
and
say
this
is
what
we
want
to
issue,
this
is
the
value
behind
it,
this
is
the
purpose
that
we're
going
to
use
the
securities
--
proceeds
of
the
securities
board
and
the
commission
then
said
you
may
sell
these
securities
or
you
may
not.
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
take
all
this
to
control
and
competition
problem.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
virtually
no
cases
at
all
under
section
20
and
there
are
no
cases
that
can
be
--
the
two
or
three
cases
that
have
been
decided
under
section
20,
all
suggest
to
me
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
that
the
only
thing
that
section
20a
is
designed
to
do
is
to
deal
with
these
physical
matters.
it
was
setup
to
run
on
a
track
of
its
own.
if
let
me
say
this,
if
there
was
not
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
a
section
5,
if
the
only
way
that
the
commission
could
be
require
to
consider
the
anticompetitive
problems
and
the
control
problems
was
to
read
it
in
the
section
20a
and
i'd
say
there
was
a
strong
reason
for
doing
it.
but
section
5
is
the
there,
there's
--
i
don't
argue
the
commission
doesn't
have
a
responsibility
under
section
5.
i
say
it
does,
i
say
it
should
discharge
it.
the
only
question
that
is
involved
here
is
whether
the
commission
has
the
power
to
defer
it
until
it
knows
what
the
results
of
this
tender
are.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
think
they
could
do
that
and
i
misunderstood
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
whether
the
commission
could
--
if
the
court
held
that
the
commission
could
not
authorize
the
20a
issue
without
first
considering
the
public
interest
and
if
that
public
interest
met
the
same
day,
they
can,
they
can
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
but
i
think
the
analogy
you
drew
between
the
denial
of
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
situation
is
an
apt
one
in
terms
of
what
happened.
the
commission
happens
to
be
operating
under
two
different,
three
different
parts
of
the
same
statute.
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
say
why
that
they
have
to
do
all
of
their
job
under
one.
all
the
commission
has
done
and
said
let's
differ
consideration
of
these
until
we
know
the
outcome
of
the
tender
offer,
and
all
we
say
is
that
the
commission
had
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
let's
no
–
let's
--
let
the
first
part
of
it
go
through.
let's
let
greyhound
buy
20%
then
we'll
see
whether
greyhound
ends
up
with
60
or
whether
the
southern
pacific
will
end
up,
and
the
santa
fe
will
end
up
in
50%.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
we
it
doesn't
have
any
alternative
in
that
respect
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
does
not
have
any
alternative
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no,
stock
changes
hand
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
don't
think
that's
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
you
were
discussing
the
chenery
doctrine
with
mr.
dempsey,
you
should
have
--
we
should
have
gone
to
the
next
paragraph
in
the
commission's
order
where
the
commission
says
that
it
is
nothing
is
determined
under
any
section
expect
20
and
5
as
for
the
future
that's
where
the
anticompetitive
--
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
rea,
railway
express
agency.
there
are
two
transactions
involved
here.
first
one
is
the
sale
by
rea
to
greyhound
of
500,000
shares
of
stock,
which
represents
20%
of
rea
stock,
and
the
commission
has
authorized
rea
under
section
20a
to
issue
that
stock,
it
being
presently
unissued
and
to
sell
it
to
greyhound,
and
the
commission
has
found
that
rea
urgently
needs
the
$10
million
that
it
will
receive
from
greyhound.
the
second
transaction
which
is
also
involved
here
is
between
greyhound
and
rea
stockholders
and
i
include
the
appellant
railroads
as
among
those
stockholders
most
importantly.
immediately
after
the
sale
by
rea
to
greyhound,
greyhound
must
make
a
tender
offer
to
rea's
shareholders
to
buy
up
to
an
additional
40%
of
rea's
presently
outstanding
stock
and
that
offer
must
be
completed
within
60
days
after
the
offer.
one
possible
result
of
those
two
transactions
is
that
greyhound
will
ultimately
own
60%
of
rea
stock.
the
more
likely
result
is
that
the
appellant
railroads
will
and
they
have
said
very
clearly
several
times
that
they
will,
exercise
their
right
of
first
refusal
with
respect
to
the
40%
of
stock
that
greyhound
will
seek
on
the
tender
offer
and
that
they
because
they
already
own
10%
will
then
own
approximately
50%
of
rea
stock.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
your
honor
it
does,
they
do.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir,
it
is,
it's
in
the
standard
operating
agreement.
it's
not
in
the
agreement
between
rea
and
greyhound.
the
unissued
stock,
500,000
shares
of
stock,
that
are
not
issued
that
we
have
to
get
permission
from
the
commission
to
issue
are
not
subject
to
the
right
of
first
refusal
that's
why
they
can
go
through.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well
they
can't
do
that
your
honor,
but
they
can
prevent
the
stock
that
is
tendered
from
going
through
to
greyhound
by
exercising
the
right
of
first
refusal
after
it
has
been
tendered,
greyhound
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
you
don't
sir,
greyhound
will
offer
to
accept
tenders
up
to
40%
of
the
stock.
the
stockholders
will
then
make
the
tender
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
to
greyhound,
once
that
is
made,
all
of
rea's
other
stockholders
have
the
right
to
take
in
and
say
i'll
take
it
at
the
same
price.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
from,
no
your
honor.
they
have
that
right
as
among
themselves.
the
stock
may
not
be
sold
to
greyhound
without
being
in
effect
offered
to
all
the
other
stockholders
at
the
same
price
and
the
tender
offer
doesn't
cut
across
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
all
right
sir.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
that
in
the
record
as
among
any
other
party
your
honor.
there
is
of
course
a
third
possibility
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir
and
as
i
will
explain
to
you
in
just
a
moment
rea
is
rather
peculiar
kind
of
animal
in
that
respect
and
i
think
that's
very
important
now.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
there
is
a
third
possibility,
a
very
small
possibility
and
that
is
that
no
stockholder
will
tender
any
stock
to
greyhound.
this
i
say
is
very
unlikely
because
the
record
shows
that
the
holders
of
900,000
shares
of
rea
stock
have
already
indicated
that
they
will
tender,
that
they
will
either
sell
to
greyhound
or
to
the
southern
pacific
or
santa
fe,
the
appellants.
now
the
commission
has
properly
we
believe
postponed
consideration
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
appellants
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
until
the
results
of
this
tender
offer
known
60
days
after
the
first
sale
takes
place.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
doubt
about
that,
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
mr.
justice
fortas
that
greyhound
wants
to
buy
control
of
rea
and
wants
to
exercise
that
control
i
don't
contend
otherwise.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
is
not
defined
under
section
20
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
that's
under
section
5
and
it's
only
under
section
5
that
the
control
problems
can
be
raised.
section
20a
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
control.
all
section
20a
says
that
when
any
railroad
wants
to
issue
any
security
it
must
go
to
the
commission
and
obtain
permission.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
is
a
very
broad
definition,
control
or
power
to
control
and
the
cases
make
perfectly
clear
that
the
definition
is
a
very
broad
one
and
it
comes
down
to
something
like
the
power
to
influence.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir
there
is.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir,
there
is
and
i
plan
to
describe
that
at
some
length
and
let
me
answer
your
question.
this
agreement
was
negotiated
not
just
between
rea
and
greyhound.
it
was
negotiated
by
rea
with
its
58
railroad
stockholders
including
the
appellant
railroads,
who
are
part
of
the
negotiating
committee.
the
deal
went
through
several
offers
and
several
different
combinations
which
i'll
describe.
i
don't
think
anyone
gave
any
consideration
until
the
agreement
was
reached
as
to
what
the
appropriate
way
was
to
structure
the
agreement
in
order
to
put
it
to
the
commission
for
approval.
this
two-step
procedure
was
just
the
result
the
way
that
it
was
negotiated.
once
the
agreement
was
made
and
then
the
lawyers
focused
more
closely
on
what
was
the
appropriate
way
to
put
it
to
the
commission,
we
were
frankly
afraid
and
i
think
the
facts
that
i'll
recite
to
you
in
a
moment
will
show
you
why,
to
try
to
re-negotiate
the
deal
because
the
appellant
railroads
had
blocked
the
deal
twice
successfully,
we
were
afraid
to
give
them
another
opportunity
to
do
it.
it
seems
to
me
somehow
unfit
to
say
that
the
commission
should
send
it
back
to
rea
and
say
reform
the
deal
and
give
the
appellants
another
chance
to
block
the
deal
as
they
did
twice,
and
as
i'll
show
you
in
a
moment,
it
took
rea
ten
months
to
put
this
thing
together
but
it
just
didn't
seem
likely
to
us
that
we
could
reform
it
in
a
successful
way
without
perhaps
depriving
ourselves
with
the
money.
but
in
any
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
you
won't
find
any
statement
by
the
commission
to
that
effect
in
the
record
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir
you
won't
find
them
stating
expressly
that.
you
will
find
the
commission
there
is
something
i
think
in
the
record
and
i
misunderstood.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
commission's
reason
was
you
honor
that
it
said
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
consider
the
section
5
or
section
7
issues
at
this
time
and
that
appears
in
the
order,
which
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well
it
goes
on
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
the
commission
goes
on
that,
your
honor
please
after
it
makes
that
finding.
that
finding
appears
on,
on
page
198
of
the
record.
it
devotes
in
my
judgment
the
next
four
paragraphs
of
the
order
to
explaining
and
setting
forth
the
reasons
why
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
consider
the
section
5
problems
and
the
section
7
problem
at
that
time.
the
paragraph
that
includes
a
statement
is
the
paragraph,
the
last
full
paragraphs
on
198,
the
next
paragraph
deals
with
this
right
of
first
refusal
that
i've
just
described
to
you.
the
paragraph
after
that
describes
the
tender
offer.
the
paragraph
after
that
describes
the
way
that
rea
is
setup
and
so
on,
but
the
commission
doesn't,
if
your
honor
question
is
focused
directly
upon
should
we
have
this
thing
reformed,
the
commission
doesn't
focus
on
that.
one
of
the
reasons
it
doesn't
is
because
that
was
never
suggested
to
it
by
any
party
below.
the
suggestion
that
mr.
dempsey
makes
now
that
the
contract
could
have
been
reformed
is
a
suggestion
that
i
believe
is
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
it
was
certainly
not
made
to
the
commission.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
together
the
five
appellants
have
245,000
shares
of
stock
out
of
presently
outstanding
2
million,
so
they
have
a
little
more
than
10%
with
the
additional
500,000
that
would
be
issued
to
greyhound,
they
have
slightly
less
than
10%
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
is
certainly
oh!
yes
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
justice
fortas
at
page
40
and
41
of
the
record,
all
of
the
stock
holdings
of
all
the
stockholders
are
set
up
by.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
900
--
the
holders
of
900,000
shares
have
said
they
will
sell
their
stock
and
they
don't
care
who
they
sell
it
to.
they
will
sell
it
to
the
southern
pacific
in
the
sante
fe
if
they
exercise
their
right
of
first
refusal;
if
it
goes
through
that,
they
will
sell
it
to
greyhound.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
your
honor
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
dempsey
has
said
that
these
two
--
that
the
proper
line
of
commerce
here
is
express
service
and
that
rea
and
greyhound
together
have
about
95%.
we
say
and
we
said
only
tangentially
before
the
commission
that
the
proper
line
of
commerce
was
the
market
were
small
packages,
were
transportation
of
small
packages
and
that
we
had
about
2%
of
that
market
and
that
greyhound
had
1%.
there
has
been
no
attempt
whatsoever
your
honor
to
resolve
this
rather
large
difference
at
the
moment
between
mr.
dempsey
and
myself
and
that
will
have
to
be
resolved
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i'm
not
saying
that
the
commission
should
not
resolve
it.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
commission
properly
postpone
consideration
up,
that's
the
only
thrust
of
my
argument.
i
couldn't--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
is
still
something
that
has
to
be
resolved.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well,
i
don't
think
it
comes
under
section
20a
at
all
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
certainly
do
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
and
indeed
and
in
many
cases
your
honor
the
only
proper
to
way
to
do
it
is
to
do
it
all
at
once
and
i'm
not
saying
otherwise.
the
only
issue
here
between
us
is
really
a
pretty
simple
one.
the
appellants
say
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
approve
the
20a
application,
the
issuance
of
securities
and
to
postpone
consideration
of
the
section
5
problems
and
i'll
call
them
that
so
that
it's
clear
at
least
in
my
mind
what
i'm
talking
about
or
the
section
7
problems
to
postpone
consideration
of
those,
as
the
commission
said
this
is
not
the
appropriate
time,
this
order
is
only
under
20a
it's
not
to
be
taken
as
raising
any
presumption.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
quite
agree,
it
is
fundamental
and
i
take
that
position.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
words,
but
for
all
intents
and
purposes
there
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
the
public
interest
is
but
i
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
well,
i
think
they
are
mr.
justice
white
because
it
requires
the
commission
under
section
5,
commission
is
required
to
take
into
consideration
the
impact
upon
other
carriers
in
making
its
determination
under
section
5.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no
sir
but
i
always
thought
that
the
principal
impact
upon
other
carriers
would
be
the
competitive
impact,
but
in
any
case
this
court
has
made
clear
in
mclean
and
lately
in
the
seaboard
case
that
the
commission
must
take
the
--
within
the
policy
to
the
antitrust
law
-–
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
yes
sir
under
section
5.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
then
you
reverse.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
if
no
–
excuses
me
–
if
what
you
say
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
if
you
say
that
the
commission
may
not
authorize
a
20a
approval
without
considering
the
anticompetitive
effects
and
if
this
court
holds
that,
that
the
public
interests
includes
that,
that
the
public
interest
in
20a
the
language
of
20a
includes
that
and
the
commission
has
not
done
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
say
that
section
20a
your
honor
in
this
i
think
mr.
rifkind
is
going
to
deal
with
this
more
fully,
but
i
say
the
20a
is
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
deal
only
with
the
physical
questions.
20a
was
passed
by
the
congress
in
1920
with
section
5.
section
5
is
setup
to
deal
with
the
control
questions
which
include
the
competition
question.
there
is
no
conceivable
reason
in
my
mind
why
you
should
say
that
if
the
congress
has
the
duty
under
section
5
to
do
all
of
these
things,
mr.
dempsey,
the
appellants
concede
that
the
principal
purpose
of
section
a
is
to
focus
on
these
problems
of
whether
there
is
stock
watering,
whether
there
is
the
value
behind
the
securities,
that's
what
section
20a
was
setup
to
deal
with.
the
appellants
concede
that's
the
principal
purpose,
but
they
say
that
a
subsidiary
purpose
is
to
reach
over
and
deal
with
all
the
problems
that
the
commission
is
required
to
deal
with
under
section
5.
now
i
say
you
can't
construe
the
statute
that
way
that
doesn't
get
rid
of
the
problems
in
any
way.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no,
your
honor
there
isn't
anything
that
actually
limits
it.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
there
isn't
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
in
anyway
suggests
to
me
that
it
is
supposed
to
consider
any
thing
other
than
what
i'll
call
the
stock
watering
problem.
you'll
recall
that
during
the
early
part
of
this
century,
the
railroads
were
notorious,
for
issuing
great
quantities
of
securities
behind
which
there
was
no
value
and
depriving
the
public
of
their
money
in
a
variety
of
ways.
now
in
1920,
we
didn't
have
a
securities
act
and
the
congress
after
the
commission
was
created
by
president
taft
and
this
commission
set
out
to
investigate
the
problem
of
stock
watering
and
the
problem
of
value
and
they
passed
section
20a
which
was
designed
to
make
the
carrier
come
to
the
commission
and
say
this
is
what
we
want
to
issue,
this
is
the
value
behind
it,
this
is
the
purpose
that
we're
going
to
use
the
securities
--
proceeds
of
the
securities
board
and
the
commission
then
said
you
may
sell
these
securities
or
you
may
not.
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
take
all
this
to
control
and
competition
problem.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
virtually
no
cases
at
all
under
section
20
and
there
are
no
cases
that
can
be
--
the
two
or
three
cases
that
have
been
decided
under
section
20,
all
suggest
to
me
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
that
the
only
thing
that
section
20a
is
designed
to
do
is
to
deal
with
these
physical
matters.
it
was
setup
to
run
on
a
track
of
its
own.
if
let
me
say
this,
if
there
was
not
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
a
section
5,
if
the
only
way
that
the
commission
could
be
require
to
consider
the
anticompetitive
problems
and
the
control
problems
was
to
read
it
in
the
section
20a
and
i'd
say
there
was
a
strong
reason
for
doing
it.
but
section
5
is
the
there,
there's
--
i
don't
argue
the
commission
doesn't
have
a
responsibility
under
section
5.
i
say
it
does,
i
say
it
should
discharge
it.
the
only
question
that
is
involved
here
is
whether
the
commission
has
the
power
to
defer
it
until
it
knows
what
the
results
of
this
tender
are.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
think
they
could
do
that
and
i
misunderstood
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
whether
the
commission
could
--
if
the
court
held
that
the
commission
could
not
authorize
the
20a
issue
without
first
considering
the
public
interest
and
if
that
public
interest
met
the
same
day,
they
can,
they
can
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
but
i
think
the
analogy
you
drew
between
the
denial
of
the
preliminary
injunction
in
this
situation
is
an
apt
one
in
terms
of
what
happened.
the
commission
happens
to
be
operating
under
two
different,
three
different
parts
of
the
same
statute.
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
say
why
that
they
have
to
do
all
of
their
job
under
one.
all
the
commission
has
done
and
said
let's
differ
consideration
of
these
until
we
know
the
outcome
of
the
tender
offer,
and
all
we
say
is
that
the
commission
had
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
let's
no
–
let's
--
let
the
first
part
of
it
go
through.
let's
let
greyhound
buy
20%
then
we'll
see
whether
greyhound
ends
up
with
60
or
whether
the
southern
pacific
will
end
up,
and
the
santa
fe
will
end
up
in
50%.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
we
it
doesn't
have
any
alternative
in
that
respect
sir.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
it
does
not
have
any
alternative
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
no,
stock
changes
hand
--
mr.
thomas
d.
barr
i
don't
think
that's
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
you
were
discussing
the
chenery
doctrine
with
mr.
dempsey,
you
should
have
--
we
should
have
gone
to
the
next
paragraph
in
the
commission's
order
where
the
commission
says
that
it
is
nothing
is
determined
under
any
section
expect
20
and
5
as
for
the
future
that's
where
the
anticompetitive
