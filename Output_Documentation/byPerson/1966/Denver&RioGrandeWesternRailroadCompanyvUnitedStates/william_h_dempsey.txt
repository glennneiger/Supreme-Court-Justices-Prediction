mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
district
of
colorado.
at
root
what
is
involved
is
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
pursuant
to
which
the
issuance
of
certain
securities
by
rea,
railway
express
agency
was
authorized,
those
securities
were
to
be
sold
to
the
greyhound
corporation
another
of
the
appellees.
the
appellants
here
are
five
railroads
who
are
stockholders
of
rea,
a
number
of
individual
motorbus
carriers
who
are
competitors
of
greyhound,
the
freight
forwarders
institute,
the
american
trucking
association
incorporated
and
a
number
of
individual
motor
carriers.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
few
moments
to
sketch
the
case
in
sort
of
an
outline
fashion.
the
basic
facts
are
quite
simple.
railway
express
is
the
number
one
ranking
carrier
of
express
freight
in
the
united
states
and
greyhound
is
the
number
two
ranking
carrier.
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
commission
that's
here
in
question
greyhound
will
acquire
a
20%
stock
interest
in
rea
and
that
will
be
accompanied
by
a
20%
representation
on
rea's
board
of
directors.
there
is
no
question
from
the
record
that
the
intent
of
the
parties
here
fundamentally
is
to
coordinate
and
consolidate
their
express
trade
activities.
now
in
these
circumstances
we
suggest
and
the
government
agrees
i
think
that
the
record
raised
a
very
serious
question
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
as
this
court
of
course
knows
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
control
by
one
carrier
of
another
without
commission
approval
pursuant
to
the
section
5
proceeding.
so
that
the
basic
question
here
is
what
should
the
commission
have
done
in
a
proceeding
that
it
was
engaged
in
when
these
were
questions
raised
on
the
record.
and
the
proceeding
that
it
was
engaged
in
was
not
a
proceeding
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
nor
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
was
a
proceeding
under
section
28
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
security
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
the
commission
made
no
findings
with
respect
to
competitive
effect
although
i
do
think
that
the
commission
made
some
findings
with
respect
to
acquisition
of
control.
there
is
a
difference
of
view
among
the
parties
on
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
it
may
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
i
am
sure
you
know
that
one
of
our
issues
here
is
a
chenery
issue,
a
question
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
commission's
order
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
really
quite
at
a
loss
in
answering
the
question
as
to
what
the
commission
felt
here
because
i
just
can't
tell.
i
think
that
with
respect
to
section
7,
one
doesn't
know
whether
the
commission
believed
that
they
didn't
have
to
consider
section
7
questions
or
any
question
with
respect
to
anticompetitive
impact
under
28
(2)
that
was
argued
to
them.
whether
they
thought
that
there
was
no
section
7
question
raised
on
the
record
that
was
argued
to
them,
whether
they
thought
that
this
was
really
a
justice
department
responsibility
or
whether
they
thought
that
they
could
do
it
later,
i
just
--
really
at
a
loss.
the
only
place
at
which
they
mention
section
7
is
in
a
sentence
of
the
very
opening
of
the
order
where
–
in
which
they
say,
i
think
i
quote
literally
that
it
is
not
appropriate
at
this
time
to
consider
the
section
7
question.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
competitive
impact
the
commission
does
say
on
page
200
of
the
record,
it
further
appearing
that
intervener's
opposition
is
directed
to
the
possibility
of
control
of
applicant
by
greyhound
and
to
the
anticipated
combination
and
correlation
of
certain
of
their
facilities
and
services.
now
there
it
seemed
to
me,
when
i
read
the
order
at
the
first
time
that
they
were
raising
the
question
of,
the
broad
question
that
you
raise,
of
anticompetitive
impact
apart
from
a
section
putting
it
section
7
terms.
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
they
go
into
the
question
of
the
position
that
greyhound
will
have
on
the
board
of
directors
and
they
indicate
their
belief
that
these
five
greyhound
directors
couldn't
influence
the
strong
railroad
directors
and
they
conclude
with
what
i
take
to
be
a
finding
that
there
is
no
control
and
maybe
a
finding
that
there
would
be
no
anticompetitive
impact
or
they
certainly
don't
say
that.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
just
can't
say
mr.
justice
stewart.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
they
conclude
that
paragraph
by
saying
and
that
control
or
power
to
control
must
be
real
and
not
based
on
conjuncture
or
remote
possibilities.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
page
201
right
on
top
and
that
concludes
i
think
the
thought
that
they
introduced
in
the
preceding
paragraph.
now
i
don't
--
it
does
certainly
doesn't
constitute
a
finding
that
they
would
be
no
anticompetitive
impact.
i
read
that
to
say
that
they
believe
that
this
20%
transaction
alone
would
not
constitute
an
acquisition
of
control
and
therefore
they
need
not
pursue
the
section
5
now.
i
cannot
find
in
that
sentence
or
in
any
other
sentence
in
the
order
a
determination
of
the
question
that
they
seem
to
be
raising
of
anticompetitive
impact.
so
that
--
i
do
think
there
is
a
very
serious
chenery
point
here.
we've
been
plagued
by
that
point
from
the
very
time
this
litigation
was
instituted
because
at
every
point
the
issue
seem
to
shift
and
at
one
time
we
are
arguing
the
scope
of
28
(2)
at
another
time
we
are
arguing
the
question
whether
there
is
control
or
not
control,
whether
there
is
a
section
7
violation
or
not,
whether
seaboard
standard
should
apply
and
i
--
this
case
it
seems
to
me
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
awkwardness
of
judicial
review
in
the
face
of
a
hopelessly
ambiguous
order.
now
so
far
as
the
–
as
the
facts
are
concerned
i
don't
know
that
i
need
to
go
into
them
in
great
detail
because
the
government
does
concede
that
this
record
does
establish
a
very
serious
problem
with
respect
to
the
anticompetitive
impact
of
this
transaction,
but
at
sometime
or
another
it
will
have
to
be
resolved.
and
rea
concedes
that
of
course
only
arguendo
because
they
will
naturally
dispute
that
in
any
further
proceeding
that's
been
held,
but
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
salient
facts.
the
greyhound
corporation
approached
and
i
might
say
that
these
facts
are
taken
almost
exclusively
from
the
papers
that
greyhound
filed.
there
was
no
hearing,
no
witnesses,
no
cross
examination,
no
sixth
amendment
problem
here.
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
greyhound
corporation
approached
rea
in
january
of
1965
with
an
offer
to
buy
a
controlling
stock
interest.
that
offer
foundered,
evidently
because
of
the
opposition
of
some
of
the
rea
stockholders
who
were
opposed
to
this
program
and
they
have
the
ability
to
block
it
because
all
existing
rea
stockholders
have
the
right
of
first
purchase
on
rea
stock
sales
so
that
if
one
rea
stockholder
wants
to
sell
to
a
third
party
another
rea
stockholder
can
come
in
and
exercise
his
right
of
first
purchase.
the
rea
management
and
board
then
struck
upon
the
notion
that
in
order
to
get
greyhound
into
the
company
the
thing
to
do
is
to
have
greyhound
buy
500,000
shares
of
authorized,
but
unissued
stock
as
to
which
the
right
of
first
purchase
does
not
apply
and
there
were
negotiations
and
in
july
of
1964,
greyhound
made
such
an
offering
a
letter.
in
the
letter,
greyhound
said
that
from
the
start
their
interest
in
rea
had
been
to
get
a
position
in
a
company
so
that
the
express
trade
activities
of
the
two
concerns
could
be
coordinated.
they
referred
to
certain
studies
that
had
been
made
by
the
company
in
this
regard.
they
said
they
didn't'
they
didn't
want
to
as
they
put
buy
into
a
controversy
with
the
dissident
rea
stockholders
so
that
they
were
willing
to
take
this
20%
position
and
leave
to
the
future
question
as
to
their
ultimate
position
of
the
company.
there
were
further
negotiations
and
then
the
matter
was
put
to
the
rea
board
which
approved
14
to
3
i
believe
the
vote
was
with
one
abstention
and
then
to
rea
stockholders
the
proxy
statement
indicated
that
the
benefits
of
the
transaction
would
be
to
secure
coordination
and
consolidation
to
express
activities.
a
heavy
vote
was
urged
because
greyhound
had
indicated
that
it
wanted
to
be
sure
that
it
would
have
the
cooperation
of
rea
management.
the
heavy
vote
was
obtained,
over
an
80%
vote
of
rea
stockholders.
now
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
these
studies
that
were
referred
to
by
greyhound,
with
one
exception
and
that's
reasonably
significant
i
think,
i
might
mention
it.
there
was
a
two
and
a
half
day
conference
between
two
vice
presidents
of
these
companies
about
three
weeks
before
greyhound
made
its
20%
offer
and
that
conference
is
memorialized
in
a
memorandum.
in
the
brief
it's
quite
long.
it's
summarized
in
some
detail
in
our
briefs
and
what
it
amounted
to
basically
was
that
the
two
vice
presidents
thought
that
the
thing
to
do
here
possible
was
really
to
have
a,
an
almost
total
union
between
two.
they
would
use
the
same
terminals,
they
would
use
the
same
service
forces,
the
same
maintenance
forces,
the
same
supervisor,
the
same
advertising
program.
rea
would
perform
pickup
and
delivery
service
for
greyhound.
they'd
have
--
entered
into
through
route
and
joint
rate
arrangements.
in
short
an
almost
complete
amalgamation.
now
we
don't
say
that
this
memorandum
is
a
binding
contract,
of
course,
we
never
had
said
that.
all
that
we
say
is
that
it
shows
with
some
specificity
the
kind
of
program
that
may
very
well
emerge
from
this
transaction.
the
contract
itself
has
several
relevant
provisions
that
i
might
mention
that
appears
on
page
15
of
the
record,
it's
a
letter
contract.
there
is
the
20%
representation
on
the
board
of
directors
clause,
sub-paragraph
a.
sub-paragraph
c
commits
the
rea
board
to
consider
seriously
and
work
toward
a
long-term
agreement
between
rea
and
the
greyhound
corporation
to
consolidate
operating
functions
and
facilities
and
to
cooperate
in
all
lawful,
feasible
and
jointly
advantageous
ways
to
effect
economy,
improve
service
and
increase
public
receptivity
and
patronage.
and
then
sub
paragraph
e
is
the
60-day
offer
clause
and
i'll
refer
to
it
as
the
60-day
offer
clause
by
which
greyhound
offered
to
purchase
up
to
an
additional
million
shares
of
rea
stock
for
a
period
of
60
days
after
the
closing
of
the
basic
20%
transaction.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas
this
is
a
point
that
we
have
raised
from
the
time
the
litigation
commenced
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
am
willing
to
adopt
that
characterization
of
it.
this
comes
--
this
goes
of
course
to
the
point
and
i
might
as
well
deal
with
it
right
now
that,
that
was
made
in
the
lower
court
that's
pressed
here
and
really
the
point
i
think
that
the
lower
court
went
off
on.
the
notion
here
seems
to
be
that
because
of
this
60-day
offer,
because
no
one
can
be
certain
now
and
the
commission
could
not
be
certain
when
it
read
this
contract
and
when
it
was
called
upon
to
act,
what
the
ultimate
position
of
greyhound
and
the
company
would
be,
it
was
appropriate
for
the
commission
simply
to
bypass
the
section
7
problem
or
the
anticompetitive
impact
problem.
the
government
says
this
is
sensible.
why
should
the
commission
conduct
an
extensive
hearing
when
at
the
end
they
may
have
to
do
it
all
over
again,
if
greyhound
picks
up
an
additional
substantial
block
of
stocks.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
[attempt
to
laughter]
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
certainly
what
has
been
part
of
our
argument
from
the
start.
we
say
more
though
than
that.
i
don't
--
from
the
commission's
point
of
view
i
am
not
going
to
urge
that
it
isn't
a
reasonable
position
for
a
commission
to
say,
well
now
we
don't
have
all
the
facts
that
we'd
like
to
have
before
us.
we
do
deal
with
this
problem
and
in
our
brief.
we
don't
think
that
double
hearing
problem
is
a
genuine
problem
in
this
case,
but
i
put
that
aside
for
the
moment
and
i
make
one
single
point
here,
which
i
think
is
dispositive.
as
i
say
if
the
commission
wants
to
take
that
kind
of
an
approach,
i
don't
say
that's
unreasonable
but
what
i
say
is
that
if
we
are
right
in
our
construction
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
obligation
of
the
commission
to
deal
with
section
7
problems
impacts
on
competition
problems
at
the
least
and
section
5
problems,
then
that
kind
of
a
position
by
the
commission
is
a
reason
for
denying
the
application,
not
a
reason
for
granting
it
and
letting
this
go
to
the
future.
what
the
commission
should
have
said,
if
that's
the
way
it
felt,
to
rea
we
suggest,
is
now
you
haven't
met
your
burden
of
proof
here
and
you
have
the
burden
of
proof,
you
haven't
met
it,
you
haven't
demonstrated
that
this
transaction
is
compatible
with
the
public
interest
under
section
20,
but
it's
for
a
lawful
object
because
this
record
raises
a
very
serious
question
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
a
very
serious
question
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
you
haven't
even
put
us
in
a
position
to
deal
with
this
problem
adequately.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes,
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
is
central
to
our
main
argument
i
would
say.
now
we
make
an
argument
in
the
alternative,
we
say
that
even
if
we
are
wrong
with
respect
to
our
view
as
to
the
scope
of
section
20
that
nonetheless
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion
to
go
ahead
with
the
section
20
proceeding,
authorize
a
transaction
that
might
very
well
violate
section
7
and
section
5
when
the
commission
has
the
obligation
under
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
to
enforce
section
7
and
under
section
5
of
course
to
enforce
that
section
or
under
section
12,
i
believe
it
is.
so
that
--
that's
a
secondary
argument
but
our
main
argument
does
hinge
on
the
meaning
of
section
20a
(2)
it
seems
to
me.
now
with
--
i
would
like
to
go
back
for
the
60-day
article
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
do
not
understand
them
to
say
that
anymore
in
their
motion
to
affirm.
i
understood
them
to
say
that,
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
i
must
say
i
think
the
government
of
course
knows
much
better
than
i.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
reading
their
brief
in
this
connection
because
there
is
what's
struck
me
as
a
rather
peculiar
paragraph,
which
said
that
the
united
states
believes,
continues
to
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
with
respect
to
impact
on
competition,
but
acquiesces
in
the
commission's
view
that
that
problem
can
be
diverted
later.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
can
be
put
off,
right.
so
that
i
can't
represent
really
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
what
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
i
--
is
an
issue
under
20a?
well,
i
think
we
are
clearly
not
together
on
that.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it
is
an
issue
under
section
11
of
the
clayton
act,
not
under
section
20,
as
i
understand
their
position.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
if
i
could
put
it.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
that
the
united
states
and
i
are
in
accord
on
that.
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
who
are?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
would
be
my
judgment
on
it.
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
commission
counsel
and
i
are
in
accord.
i
certainly
i
am
not
sure
that
the
commission
is
accord.
i
think
one
here
has
to
judge
not
on
the
basis
of
the
excellent
brief
that
that
solicitor
general
has
written.
he
certainly
has
put
up
as
he
always
does
a
stronger
defense
with
this
agency
action
as
anyone
could
do,
but
so
far
as
predicting
what
the
commission
will
do
mr.
justice
white
i
would
refer
to
the
order
of
the
commission
and
if
one
has
to
make
an
educated
guess
on
the
basis
of
that
order
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes
certainly
mr.
justice
white
but
i
don't
--
all
that
i
am
saying
is
that
under
chenery
the
agency
order
has
to
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
the
order
and
not
on
what
said
by
commission
counsel.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
right,
yes
i
didn't
want
to
suggest
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
are
certainly
--
i
didn't'
mean
to
suggest
that
they
were
apart
in
this
case.
the
government
of
united
states
opposed
it
as
you
say
before
the
commission.
they
remained
neutral
in
the
lower
court
and
they
are
now
together
with
the
commission.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
that's
the
paragraph
that
i
have
reference
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
so
i
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
the
only
indication
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
oh
yes
they
are
together
in
their
doctrinal
argument
here
as
to
the
grounds
for
affirming
the
decision,
but
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
as
to
what
might
happen
in
the
future
and
that's,
–
it
was
that
paragraph
in
the
brief
that
i
have
referenced
to.
i
might,
now
as
to
60-day
offer
matter
i
just
like
to
return
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
justice
fortas
you
asked
what
the
reason
would
be
for
that
provision
and
that
i
just
don't
know
because
we
have
put
that
question
before.
in
order
to
revise
it,
that
is
to
say
if
the
commission
would
have
done
what
i
suggest
and
that
is
to
say
you
haven't
met
your
burden
of
proof,
we
don't
want
to
be
faced
even
with
the
possibility
of
two
hearings
here,
go
back
and
rewrite
your
contract,
all
it
would
have
been
involved
here
would
have
been
to
make
that
60-day
offer
expire
before
the
case
went
to
the
commission
and
that
would
have
meant
simply
that
the
rea
stockholders
who
might
want
to
sell
would
have
to
so
indicate
earlier
and
those
who
might
want
to
exercise
their
right
of
first
purchase
would
have
to
indicate
further,
earlier,
all
of
course
subject
to
commissioned
approval
as
it
would
inevitably
be
in
any
event.
now
why
that
couldn't
be
done,
why
it
was
done
this
way,
we
suggest
that
it
could
have
been
done
and
the
commission
should
have
required
that
it
be
done
if
the
commission
was
troubled
by
this
problem
of
a
possible
double
hearing
of
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
take
it
that
that's
their
position,
at
least
their
ripe
for
consideration
whether
it
would
ripe
for
resolution
i
am
not
sure
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
well
i
think
that
i'd
like
to
make
my
response
in
several
parts
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no
that's
not
--
no
those
are
points
i
would
have
made
in
any
event.
in
the
first
place
if
the
commission
had
done
that
in
this
case
we
would
be
confronted
with
the
different
problem
here,
the
commission
did
not.
if
the
commission
had
said
in
this
case
it
doesn't
look
like
there
is
any
chance
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
section
7
finding
here
ultimately,
we
would
be
urging
that
was
plainly
wrong
and
the
government
i
take
it
so
far
as
one
can
tell,
would
be
agreeing
with
this.
so
that
distinguishes
it.
now
in
addition
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
they
continue
to
believe
that
serious
question
on
this
score
that
is
score
of
competitive
consequences
remain
to
be
investigated
i
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
fortas
i
think
maybe
i
should
read
from
their,
from
their
initial
submission
in
this
connection
because
i
read
what
they
said
there
to
mean
that
they
continue
to
have
that
view
although
its
somewhat
more
ambiguously
stated.
what
they
say
in
their
initial
submission
to
the
commission
states
our
position
succinctly.
there
the
government
said
that
petitioner,
that
is
the
government,
asserts
that
the
application
places
before
the
commission
serious
questions
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
which
by
virtue
of
section
11
thereof
the
commission
has
a
duty
to
enforce.
greyhound
will
if
the
commission
approves
this
application
to
acquire
a
substantial
stock
interest
etc,
and
they
go
ahead,
and
then
they
conclude
therefore
the
commission
in
accordance
with
its
responsibilities
under
section
11
cannot
avoid
determining
to
what
extent,
depending
the
proposed
transactional
result
and
effects
of
section
7
is
intended
to
prevent.
i
think
that's
a
somewhat
clear
statement
than
what
they
have
in
their
brief
now.
maybe
they
intend
to
repeat
from
it.
if
they
don't
in
any
event
if
they
adhere
to
that
then
they
would
be
on
our
side
in
opposing
a
postponement
on
the
ground
if
there
was
no
prospect
of
ultimate
success
in
the
litigation.
in
addition
i
would
think
that
on
the
section
5
issue,
certainly
there
is
a
substantial
question.
now
with
respect
to
the
temporary
restraining
order
problem
mr.
justice
white
there
is
another
difference
i
think
and
that
is
that
the
commission
does
operate
here
within
a
statutory
framework.
section
20a
(2)
requires
that
if
determined
that
the
transaction
is
compatible
with
the
public
interest
and
for
a
lawful
object.
now
in
the
penn
central
case,
the
solicitor
general
was
here
arguing
that
the
commission
couldn't
truncate
its
procedures
the
way
it
did.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
no
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
don't.
i
am
just
saying
that
in
a
certain
sense
they
involve
the
same
kind
of
procedural
problems.
i
might
suggest
that
i
think
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
problems
that
the
government
avoids
here
by
virtue
of
the
doctrinal
argument
that
they
are
making
is
that
it
is
not
relevant.
penn
central
is
not
relevant
at
all
if
public
interest
doesn't
include
any
question
other
than
fiscal
soundness
of
the
proposed
transaction.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
they
are
estopped
or
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
sort,
but
that
the
problem
of
the
statutory
framework
is
one
that
does
exists.
if
they
must
make
a
determination
with
respect
to
the
public
interest
and
if
that
does
include
as
we
say
as
an
ingredient
the
anticompetitive
impact
of
the
transaction
then
we
suggest
that
it
is
different
than
an
regular
restraining
order
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
if
there
was
a
section
5
proceeding?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
railroad
motor
carrier
case
of
course
it
comes
in
specifically
section
5.
if
it's
not
a
railroad
motor
case
then
i
take
it,
it
comes
in
either
under
--
i
take
it
comes
in
under
the
public
interest
standard
of
section
5,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right,
but
it
isn't
the
only
reason
though.
it
isn't
only
the
mclean
line
of
decisions
that's
relevant
here,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
also
california
versus
federal
power
commission,
the
rca
case,
every
case
that
this
court
has
decided
that
we've
been
able
to
find
involving
the
question
whether
a
term
like
public
interest
includes
reference
to
anticompetitive
factors,
has
gone
the
same
way.
the
court
has
always
said
that
it
does.
every
lower
court
decision
that
we
found
goes
the
same
way.
we
don't
say
they
are
controlling
authority,
but
certainly
it
seems
to
us
that
they're
instructed.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
that
we
do
have
a
better
case,
it
seems
it's
a
little
easier
to
argue
but
as
--
in
point
of
fact
i
don't
suggest
that
the
case
should
come
out
any
differently.
i
think
that
if
the
government
is
right
in
suggesting
that
the
--
if
the
commission
had
acted
the
way
that
we
say
it
should
have
acted,
to
have
produced
absurd
results
that
that's
a
very
good
ground
for
thinking
that
our
doctrinal
analysis
is
wrong
one
way
or
another.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we're
right
in
suggesting
that
there
were
no
difficult
practical
problems
involved
here,
that
there
may
very
well
be
damaged,
we
maybe
injured,
the
public
interest
maybe
injured
then
i
would
think
that
whether
you
put
it
under
20a
(2)
or
whether
you
put
it
under
5,
under
11
and
coordinated
enforcement
of
this
network
of
statutes,
you
really
ought
to
come
out
the
same
way.
but
--
well
let
me
say
one
more
thing
though
in
that
connection.
i
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
administrative
procedure
that
we
would
urge
that
it's
more
desirable
to
read
the
statute
so
as
to
include
these
factors
so
that
one
doesn't
get
into
this
problem
continuously
about
whether
the
commission
abused
it's
discretion
in
not
bringing
a
section
7
proceeding
immediately
or
waiting
50
days
or
waiting
an
year
or
whatever
it
might
be,
similarly
with
the
section
5
proceeding.
i
think
when
the
congress
says
that
the
commission
must
determine
that
a
transaction
is
in
the
public
interest
before
it
authorizes
it,
that
then
the
commission
is
on
notice
that
it's
got
to
be
on
some
fashion
at
least
with
every
ingredient
of
the
public
interest,
everything
that
touches
the
public
interest
in
a
decently
immediate
way.
so
that
i
think
there
is
some
purpose
in
reading
the
statute
that
way
in
terms
of
the
operation
of
the
agency.
the
question
of
impact
on
the
appellants
i
think
is
important
here,
it's
one
of
the
practical
considerations
that
the
government
advances.
and
as
to
that,
i
think
one
can't
say,
and
this
would
be
relevant
to
the
temporary
restraining
order
situation
also,
i
think
one
cannot
say
with
any
reasonable
degree
of
certitude
precisely
what
the
risks
are
going
to
be
here.
there
are
too
many
contingency.
the
60-day
offer
might
come
out
in
a
variety
of
different
ways,
but
what
one
can
say
it
seems
to
me
fairly
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
some
kind
and
that
root,
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
approved
this
basic
20%
transaction
and
that
transaction
is
going
to
be
in
effect
whatever
is
done
with
respect
to
instituting
a
section
5
proceeding
or
a
section
11
proceeding
in
the
future.
now,
we
have
motorbus
carriers
who
alleged
before
the
commission
that
their
degree
of
profitability,
their
measure
of
profitability
basically
turned
upon
express
carriage.
so
that
we
have
people
who
are
in
a
peculiarly
vulnerable
position.
the
proceeding,
if
there's
one,
may
last
for
two
or
three
years.
everyone
agrees
it
would
be
protracted.
so
the
government
suggests
though
that,
well,
perhaps
the
commission
could
do
something
such
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
might
be
done
in
a
temporary
restraining
order
case
in
order
to
protect
the
parties.
perhaps
they
could
impose
an
interim
condition
on,
if
they
began
a
section
5
proceeding,
perhaps
they
can
put
the
stock
in
a
boarding
trust
or
direct
the
greyhound
directors
not
sit
on
the
rea
board.
well,
perhaps
they
could,
but
no
one
knows
whether
they
will
and
if
one
must
measure
the
probabilities,
one
i
think
must
consider
that
they
did
not
do
that
in
this
proceeding
where
they
could.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
under
section
20,
i
think
indisputably
true
that's
their
position
under
section
20.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
that
is
their
position.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
burden
of
truth
is
on
the
applicant
under
section
20.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
the
opposite
would
be
true
under
section
11,
now
under
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
under
section
5
i
would
say
that
there
too
the
--
well,
if
it's
an
application
for
approval
and
of
course
the
applicant
has
the
burden
of
approval.
if
the
commission
is
investigating
frankly
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'm
just
not
sure,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
certainly
however
under
section
11
case
the
burden
would
be
different.
i
might
say
that
with
respect
to
the
penn
central
case,
i'm
not
an
expert
in
that
litigation,
it's
terribly
complex,
but
i
might
say
this
about
it,
that
in
that
proceeding
at
least
the
commission
tried.
now
this
court
may
hold
that
they
didn't
succeed,
but
at
least
they
tried
to
deal
with
all
factors
that
were
relevant
to
the
public
interest.
in
this
case,
they
didn't
even
try
we
say
what
we
think
we
have
here
is
the
kind
--
if
i
recall
judge
friendly's
opinion
there,
he
referred
to
a
case
that
one
does
not
meet
in
real
life,
where
the
commission
approves
the
transaction
while
deferring
all
the
consideration
of
factors
to
the
future
and
i
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
kind
of
case
in
real
life.
they
have
simply
put
the
matter
on
to
the
trial.
the
--
as
to
the
threshold
doctoral
question
of
the
scope
of
20a
(2),
the
appellees
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
is
controlling.
what
that
legislative
history
shows
is
that
when
the
congress
passed
the
securities
provision
the
problem
that
bothered
them
was
certainly
the
problem
of
fiscal
manipulation.
but
there
is
not
a
single
item
of
legislative
history
that
establishes
that
when
the
congress
employed
the
term
public
interest
and
lawful
object,
that
they
intended
that
the
commission
restrict
it's
consideration
to
problems
of
the
fiscal
soundness
of
the
issue.
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
to
that
effect
and
we
suggest
that
when
one
is
confronted
with
terms
in
their
natural
scope
would
include
anticompetitive
factors,
that
one
has
to
have
a
--
has
to
measure
up
to
a
very
strong
and
a
very
heavy
burden
of
proof
in
terms
of
legislative
history
to
this
conflict.
they
also
suggest
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
alleghany
case
is
controlling
here.
the
alleghany
case
of
course
as
the
court
knows
that
is
a
very
complex
body
of
litigation.
we've
gone
through
it
in
rather
laborious
detail
in
our
brief
i'm
afraid.
i
would
make
just
one
point
about
it
here.
we
don't
think
that
the
appellees
read
the
case
correctly,
neither
did
the
lower
court.
the
lower
court
thought
that
alleghany
was
not
controlling.
what
the
appellees
says
that
in
alleghany,
alleghany
ii,
the
second
per
curiam
decision,
this
court
held
that
section
5
questions
were
not
relevant
in
the
section
20a
(2)
proceedings.
as
i
say,
we
don't,
for
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
don't
read
it
in
that
way,
but
even
if
that's
right,
even
if
that's
what
the
court
meant
in
that
case,
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
case
because
of
the
character
of
the
section
5
issue
in
that
case.
there
the
section
5
question
was
the
allegedly
illegal
acquisition
of
the
new
york
central
by
alleghany
at
some
time
prior
to
the
section
20a
(2)
proceeding
and
the
securities
that
were
in
question
there
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
prior
acquisition
of
control.
it
was
just
an
exchange
of
one
kind
of
preferred
stock
for
another.
now
we
don't
say
that
in
a
section
20a
(2)
proceeding
the
commission
must
consider
every
past
misdeed
of
an
applicant.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
commission,
where
the
securities
issues
is
to
be
used
as
a
vehicle
for
acquiring
control
illegally
or
may
be,
and
where
it
is
to
be
used
as
an
instrument
for
the
violation
of
section
7
at
least
perhaps
that
the
commission
must
resolve
that
kind
of
section
5
problem
and
that
kind
of
section
7
problem
in
the
section
20a
(2)
proceeding
and
we
suggest
that
alleghany
however
it
may
be
read
doesn't
bear
on
that
problem
at
all.
i
think
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
think
with
all
of
those
results
would
be
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
commission
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
brief
remarks
that
i
like
to
make.
so
far
as
the
practical
problem
that
the
commission
speaks
about
here,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
major
justification
they
present
for
going
ahead
with
this
acquisition
transaction
before,
result
with
these
problems,
that
i
say,
they
say
that
the
commission
under
my
view
would
have
to
deal
with
this
peacefully.
now,
that
isn't
so.
i
spent
sometime
in
my
opening
argument
dealing
with
the
possibility
if
the
commission
wish
to
do
it
by
simply
having
this
contract
reformed
and
all
it
would
be
involved,
would
be
move
the
60-day
period
back.
now
the
only
response
that
has
been
made
to
that
is
one
that
the
--
this
would
give
the
appellant
railroads
another
chance
to
block
the
transactions
which
it
is
said
they
did
twice.
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
the
twice
involve
situations
where
the
right
of
first
purchase
was
in
question,
that
is
to
say
outstanding
stock,
50%
acquisition.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
acquisition
of
the
500,000
shares,
which
we
cannot
block
because
over
80%
of
the
rea
stockholders
voted
for
this
transaction.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
--
rather
been
raised.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas
and
we
don't
really
see
that
a
double
proceeding
would
be
necessary
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
anticompetitive
problems
involved
could
be
dealt
with
at
the
outset
even
without
this
kind
of
information.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white
that's
right.
in
addition
it
said
that
we
didn't
suggest
this
until
this
court,
is
not
precisely
correct.
we
did
suggested
in
the
lower
court
but
in
any
events
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned
this
is
not
a
private
party
litigation.
this
is
a
section
20a(2)
proceeding
in
which
it's
the
commission's
responsibility
to
protect
the
public
interest.
so
that
whether
or
not
a
private
party
makes
a
point.
we
didn't
have
much
of
a
chance
because
they
weren't
any
briefs,
there
were
no
arguments
just
petitions
to
intervene,
which
were
denied
or
which
were
granted
and
request
for
hearing
which
were
denied
and
the
petitions
for
rehearing.
but
in
any
event,
it's
the
commission's
responsibility
do
bear
a
statutory
burden
you're
not
the
private
parties.
now,
so
far
as
what
may
happen,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
real
difference
here.
there
will
be,
everyone
agrees
if
there
is
a
proceeding
two
or
three
year
proceeding
damage
maybe
done
in
the
interim
and
we
are
not
comforted
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
may
or
may
not
try
to
insulate
this
transaction
in
the
interim
period.
we
don't
see
any
judicial
review
that
we'd
have
available
if
they
chose
not
to
do.
and
so
far
as
the
prospects
of
a
proceeding
has
been
brought
or
concerned,
we
are
not
very
comforted
there
either
by
the
fact
in
this
court
it
appears
that
there
seems
to
be
agreement
as
to
what
has
gone
because
after
all
it
is
up
to
the
commission.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
district
of
colorado.
at
root
what
is
involved
is
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
pursuant
to
which
the
issuance
of
certain
securities
by
rea,
railway
express
agency
was
authorized,
those
securities
were
to
be
sold
to
the
greyhound
corporation
another
of
the
appellees.
the
appellants
here
are
five
railroads
who
are
stockholders
of
rea,
a
number
of
individual
motorbus
carriers
who
are
competitors
of
greyhound,
the
freight
forwarders
institute,
the
american
trucking
association
incorporated
and
a
number
of
individual
motor
carriers.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
few
moments
to
sketch
the
case
in
sort
of
an
outline
fashion.
the
basic
facts
are
quite
simple.
railway
express
is
the
number
one
ranking
carrier
of
express
freight
in
the
united
states
and
greyhound
is
the
number
two
ranking
carrier.
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
commission
that's
here
in
question
greyhound
will
acquire
a
20%
stock
interest
in
rea
and
that
will
be
accompanied
by
a
20%
representation
on
rea's
board
of
directors.
there
is
no
question
from
the
record
that
the
intent
of
the
parties
here
fundamentally
is
to
coordinate
and
consolidate
their
express
trade
activities.
now
in
these
circumstances
we
suggest
and
the
government
agrees
i
think
that
the
record
raised
a
very
serious
question
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
as
this
court
of
course
knows
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
control
by
one
carrier
of
another
without
commission
approval
pursuant
to
the
section
5
proceeding.
so
that
the
basic
question
here
is
what
should
the
commission
have
done
in
a
proceeding
that
it
was
engaged
in
when
these
were
questions
raised
on
the
record.
and
the
proceeding
that
it
was
engaged
in
was
not
a
proceeding
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
nor
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
was
a
proceeding
under
section
28
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
security
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
the
commission
made
no
findings
with
respect
to
competitive
effect
although
i
do
think
that
the
commission
made
some
findings
with
respect
to
acquisition
of
control.
there
is
a
difference
of
view
among
the
parties
on
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
it
may
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
i
am
sure
you
know
that
one
of
our
issues
here
is
a
chenery
issue,
a
question
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
commission's
order
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
really
quite
at
a
loss
in
answering
the
question
as
to
what
the
commission
felt
here
because
i
just
can't
tell.
i
think
that
with
respect
to
section
7,
one
doesn't
know
whether
the
commission
believed
that
they
didn't
have
to
consider
section
7
questions
or
any
question
with
respect
to
anticompetitive
impact
under
28
(2)
that
was
argued
to
them.
whether
they
thought
that
there
was
no
section
7
question
raised
on
the
record
that
was
argued
to
them,
whether
they
thought
that
this
was
really
a
justice
department
responsibility
or
whether
they
thought
that
they
could
do
it
later,
i
just
--
really
at
a
loss.
the
only
place
at
which
they
mention
section
7
is
in
a
sentence
of
the
very
opening
of
the
order
where
–
in
which
they
say,
i
think
i
quote
literally
that
it
is
not
appropriate
at
this
time
to
consider
the
section
7
question.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
competitive
impact
the
commission
does
say
on
page
200
of
the
record,
it
further
appearing
that
intervener's
opposition
is
directed
to
the
possibility
of
control
of
applicant
by
greyhound
and
to
the
anticipated
combination
and
correlation
of
certain
of
their
facilities
and
services.
now
there
it
seemed
to
me,
when
i
read
the
order
at
the
first
time
that
they
were
raising
the
question
of,
the
broad
question
that
you
raise,
of
anticompetitive
impact
apart
from
a
section
putting
it
section
7
terms.
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
they
go
into
the
question
of
the
position
that
greyhound
will
have
on
the
board
of
directors
and
they
indicate
their
belief
that
these
five
greyhound
directors
couldn't
influence
the
strong
railroad
directors
and
they
conclude
with
what
i
take
to
be
a
finding
that
there
is
no
control
and
maybe
a
finding
that
there
would
be
no
anticompetitive
impact
or
they
certainly
don't
say
that.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
just
can't
say
mr.
justice
stewart.
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
they
conclude
that
paragraph
by
saying
and
that
control
or
power
to
control
must
be
real
and
not
based
on
conjuncture
or
remote
possibilities.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
page
201
right
on
top
and
that
concludes
i
think
the
thought
that
they
introduced
in
the
preceding
paragraph.
now
i
don't
--
it
does
certainly
doesn't
constitute
a
finding
that
they
would
be
no
anticompetitive
impact.
i
read
that
to
say
that
they
believe
that
this
20%
transaction
alone
would
not
constitute
an
acquisition
of
control
and
therefore
they
need
not
pursue
the
section
5
now.
i
cannot
find
in
that
sentence
or
in
any
other
sentence
in
the
order
a
determination
of
the
question
that
they
seem
to
be
raising
of
anticompetitive
impact.
so
that
--
i
do
think
there
is
a
very
serious
chenery
point
here.
we've
been
plagued
by
that
point
from
the
very
time
this
litigation
was
instituted
because
at
every
point
the
issue
seem
to
shift
and
at
one
time
we
are
arguing
the
scope
of
28
(2)
at
another
time
we
are
arguing
the
question
whether
there
is
control
or
not
control,
whether
there
is
a
section
7
violation
or
not,
whether
seaboard
standard
should
apply
and
i
--
this
case
it
seems
to
me
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
awkwardness
of
judicial
review
in
the
face
of
a
hopelessly
ambiguous
order.
now
so
far
as
the
–
as
the
facts
are
concerned
i
don't
know
that
i
need
to
go
into
them
in
great
detail
because
the
government
does
concede
that
this
record
does
establish
a
very
serious
problem
with
respect
to
the
anticompetitive
impact
of
this
transaction,
but
at
sometime
or
another
it
will
have
to
be
resolved.
and
rea
concedes
that
of
course
only
arguendo
because
they
will
naturally
dispute
that
in
any
further
proceeding
that's
been
held,
but
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
salient
facts.
the
greyhound
corporation
approached
and
i
might
say
that
these
facts
are
taken
almost
exclusively
from
the
papers
that
greyhound
filed.
there
was
no
hearing,
no
witnesses,
no
cross
examination,
no
sixth
amendment
problem
here.
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
greyhound
corporation
approached
rea
in
january
of
1965
with
an
offer
to
buy
a
controlling
stock
interest.
that
offer
foundered,
evidently
because
of
the
opposition
of
some
of
the
rea
stockholders
who
were
opposed
to
this
program
and
they
have
the
ability
to
block
it
because
all
existing
rea
stockholders
have
the
right
of
first
purchase
on
rea
stock
sales
so
that
if
one
rea
stockholder
wants
to
sell
to
a
third
party
another
rea
stockholder
can
come
in
and
exercise
his
right
of
first
purchase.
the
rea
management
and
board
then
struck
upon
the
notion
that
in
order
to
get
greyhound
into
the
company
the
thing
to
do
is
to
have
greyhound
buy
500,000
shares
of
authorized,
but
unissued
stock
as
to
which
the
right
of
first
purchase
does
not
apply
and
there
were
negotiations
and
in
july
of
1964,
greyhound
made
such
an
offering
a
letter.
in
the
letter,
greyhound
said
that
from
the
start
their
interest
in
rea
had
been
to
get
a
position
in
a
company
so
that
the
express
trade
activities
of
the
two
concerns
could
be
coordinated.
they
referred
to
certain
studies
that
had
been
made
by
the
company
in
this
regard.
they
said
they
didn't'
they
didn't
want
to
as
they
put
buy
into
a
controversy
with
the
dissident
rea
stockholders
so
that
they
were
willing
to
take
this
20%
position
and
leave
to
the
future
question
as
to
their
ultimate
position
of
the
company.
there
were
further
negotiations
and
then
the
matter
was
put
to
the
rea
board
which
approved
14
to
3
i
believe
the
vote
was
with
one
abstention
and
then
to
rea
stockholders
the
proxy
statement
indicated
that
the
benefits
of
the
transaction
would
be
to
secure
coordination
and
consolidation
to
express
activities.
a
heavy
vote
was
urged
because
greyhound
had
indicated
that
it
wanted
to
be
sure
that
it
would
have
the
cooperation
of
rea
management.
the
heavy
vote
was
obtained,
over
an
80%
vote
of
rea
stockholders.
now
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
these
studies
that
were
referred
to
by
greyhound,
with
one
exception
and
that's
reasonably
significant
i
think,
i
might
mention
it.
there
was
a
two
and
a
half
day
conference
between
two
vice
presidents
of
these
companies
about
three
weeks
before
greyhound
made
its
20%
offer
and
that
conference
is
memorialized
in
a
memorandum.
in
the
brief
it's
quite
long.
it's
summarized
in
some
detail
in
our
briefs
and
what
it
amounted
to
basically
was
that
the
two
vice
presidents
thought
that
the
thing
to
do
here
possible
was
really
to
have
a,
an
almost
total
union
between
two.
they
would
use
the
same
terminals,
they
would
use
the
same
service
forces,
the
same
maintenance
forces,
the
same
supervisor,
the
same
advertising
program.
rea
would
perform
pickup
and
delivery
service
for
greyhound.
they'd
have
--
entered
into
through
route
and
joint
rate
arrangements.
in
short
an
almost
complete
amalgamation.
now
we
don't
say
that
this
memorandum
is
a
binding
contract,
of
course,
we
never
had
said
that.
all
that
we
say
is
that
it
shows
with
some
specificity
the
kind
of
program
that
may
very
well
emerge
from
this
transaction.
the
contract
itself
has
several
relevant
provisions
that
i
might
mention
that
appears
on
page
15
of
the
record,
it's
a
letter
contract.
there
is
the
20%
representation
on
the
board
of
directors
clause,
sub-paragraph
a.
sub-paragraph
c
commits
the
rea
board
to
consider
seriously
and
work
toward
a
long-term
agreement
between
rea
and
the
greyhound
corporation
to
consolidate
operating
functions
and
facilities
and
to
cooperate
in
all
lawful,
feasible
and
jointly
advantageous
ways
to
effect
economy,
improve
service
and
increase
public
receptivity
and
patronage.
and
then
sub
paragraph
e
is
the
60-day
offer
clause
and
i'll
refer
to
it
as
the
60-day
offer
clause
by
which
greyhound
offered
to
purchase
up
to
an
additional
million
shares
of
rea
stock
for
a
period
of
60
days
after
the
closing
of
the
basic
20%
transaction.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas
this
is
a
point
that
we
have
raised
from
the
time
the
litigation
commenced
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
am
willing
to
adopt
that
characterization
of
it.
this
comes
--
this
goes
of
course
to
the
point
and
i
might
as
well
deal
with
it
right
now
that,
that
was
made
in
the
lower
court
that's
pressed
here
and
really
the
point
i
think
that
the
lower
court
went
off
on.
the
notion
here
seems
to
be
that
because
of
this
60-day
offer,
because
no
one
can
be
certain
now
and
the
commission
could
not
be
certain
when
it
read
this
contract
and
when
it
was
called
upon
to
act,
what
the
ultimate
position
of
greyhound
and
the
company
would
be,
it
was
appropriate
for
the
commission
simply
to
bypass
the
section
7
problem
or
the
anticompetitive
impact
problem.
the
government
says
this
is
sensible.
why
should
the
commission
conduct
an
extensive
hearing
when
at
the
end
they
may
have
to
do
it
all
over
again,
if
greyhound
picks
up
an
additional
substantial
block
of
stocks.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
[attempt
to
laughter]
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
certainly
what
has
been
part
of
our
argument
from
the
start.
we
say
more
though
than
that.
i
don't
--
from
the
commission's
point
of
view
i
am
not
going
to
urge
that
it
isn't
a
reasonable
position
for
a
commission
to
say,
well
now
we
don't
have
all
the
facts
that
we'd
like
to
have
before
us.
we
do
deal
with
this
problem
and
in
our
brief.
we
don't
think
that
double
hearing
problem
is
a
genuine
problem
in
this
case,
but
i
put
that
aside
for
the
moment
and
i
make
one
single
point
here,
which
i
think
is
dispositive.
as
i
say
if
the
commission
wants
to
take
that
kind
of
an
approach,
i
don't
say
that's
unreasonable
but
what
i
say
is
that
if
we
are
right
in
our
construction
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
obligation
of
the
commission
to
deal
with
section
7
problems
impacts
on
competition
problems
at
the
least
and
section
5
problems,
then
that
kind
of
a
position
by
the
commission
is
a
reason
for
denying
the
application,
not
a
reason
for
granting
it
and
letting
this
go
to
the
future.
what
the
commission
should
have
said,
if
that's
the
way
it
felt,
to
rea
we
suggest,
is
now
you
haven't
met
your
burden
of
proof
here
and
you
have
the
burden
of
proof,
you
haven't
met
it,
you
haven't
demonstrated
that
this
transaction
is
compatible
with
the
public
interest
under
section
20,
but
it's
for
a
lawful
object
because
this
record
raises
a
very
serious
question
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
a
very
serious
question
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
you
haven't
even
put
us
in
a
position
to
deal
with
this
problem
adequately.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes,
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
is
central
to
our
main
argument
i
would
say.
now
we
make
an
argument
in
the
alternative,
we
say
that
even
if
we
are
wrong
with
respect
to
our
view
as
to
the
scope
of
section
20
that
nonetheless
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion
to
go
ahead
with
the
section
20
proceeding,
authorize
a
transaction
that
might
very
well
violate
section
7
and
section
5
when
the
commission
has
the
obligation
under
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
to
enforce
section
7
and
under
section
5
of
course
to
enforce
that
section
or
under
section
12,
i
believe
it
is.
so
that
--
that's
a
secondary
argument
but
our
main
argument
does
hinge
on
the
meaning
of
section
20a
(2)
it
seems
to
me.
now
with
--
i
would
like
to
go
back
for
the
60-day
article
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
do
not
understand
them
to
say
that
anymore
in
their
motion
to
affirm.
i
understood
them
to
say
that,
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
i
must
say
i
think
the
government
of
course
knows
much
better
than
i.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
reading
their
brief
in
this
connection
because
there
is
what's
struck
me
as
a
rather
peculiar
paragraph,
which
said
that
the
united
states
believes,
continues
to
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
with
respect
to
impact
on
competition,
but
acquiesces
in
the
commission's
view
that
that
problem
can
be
diverted
later.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
can
be
put
off,
right.
so
that
i
can't
represent
really
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
what
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
i
--
is
an
issue
under
20a?
well,
i
think
we
are
clearly
not
together
on
that.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
it
is
an
issue
under
section
11
of
the
clayton
act,
not
under
section
20,
as
i
understand
their
position.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
if
i
could
put
it.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
that
the
united
states
and
i
are
in
accord
on
that.
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
who
are?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
would
be
my
judgment
on
it.
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
commission
counsel
and
i
are
in
accord.
i
certainly
i
am
not
sure
that
the
commission
is
accord.
i
think
one
here
has
to
judge
not
on
the
basis
of
the
excellent
brief
that
that
solicitor
general
has
written.
he
certainly
has
put
up
as
he
always
does
a
stronger
defense
with
this
agency
action
as
anyone
could
do,
but
so
far
as
predicting
what
the
commission
will
do
mr.
justice
white
i
would
refer
to
the
order
of
the
commission
and
if
one
has
to
make
an
educated
guess
on
the
basis
of
that
order
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes
certainly
mr.
justice
white
but
i
don't
--
all
that
i
am
saying
is
that
under
chenery
the
agency
order
has
to
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
the
order
and
not
on
what
said
by
commission
counsel.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
right,
yes
i
didn't
want
to
suggest
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
are
certainly
--
i
didn't'
mean
to
suggest
that
they
were
apart
in
this
case.
the
government
of
united
states
opposed
it
as
you
say
before
the
commission.
they
remained
neutral
in
the
lower
court
and
they
are
now
together
with
the
commission.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
that's
the
paragraph
that
i
have
reference
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
so
i
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
the
only
indication
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
oh
yes
they
are
together
in
their
doctrinal
argument
here
as
to
the
grounds
for
affirming
the
decision,
but
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
as
to
what
might
happen
in
the
future
and
that's,
–
it
was
that
paragraph
in
the
brief
that
i
have
referenced
to.
i
might,
now
as
to
60-day
offer
matter
i
just
like
to
return
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
justice
fortas
you
asked
what
the
reason
would
be
for
that
provision
and
that
i
just
don't
know
because
we
have
put
that
question
before.
in
order
to
revise
it,
that
is
to
say
if
the
commission
would
have
done
what
i
suggest
and
that
is
to
say
you
haven't
met
your
burden
of
proof,
we
don't
want
to
be
faced
even
with
the
possibility
of
two
hearings
here,
go
back
and
rewrite
your
contract,
all
it
would
have
been
involved
here
would
have
been
to
make
that
60-day
offer
expire
before
the
case
went
to
the
commission
and
that
would
have
meant
simply
that
the
rea
stockholders
who
might
want
to
sell
would
have
to
so
indicate
earlier
and
those
who
might
want
to
exercise
their
right
of
first
purchase
would
have
to
indicate
further,
earlier,
all
of
course
subject
to
commissioned
approval
as
it
would
inevitably
be
in
any
event.
now
why
that
couldn't
be
done,
why
it
was
done
this
way,
we
suggest
that
it
could
have
been
done
and
the
commission
should
have
required
that
it
be
done
if
the
commission
was
troubled
by
this
problem
of
a
possible
double
hearing
of
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
take
it
that
that's
their
position,
at
least
their
ripe
for
consideration
whether
it
would
ripe
for
resolution
i
am
not
sure
but
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
well
i
think
that
i'd
like
to
make
my
response
in
several
parts
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no
that's
not
--
no
those
are
points
i
would
have
made
in
any
event.
in
the
first
place
if
the
commission
had
done
that
in
this
case
we
would
be
confronted
with
the
different
problem
here,
the
commission
did
not.
if
the
commission
had
said
in
this
case
it
doesn't
look
like
there
is
any
chance
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
section
7
finding
here
ultimately,
we
would
be
urging
that
was
plainly
wrong
and
the
government
i
take
it
so
far
as
one
can
tell,
would
be
agreeing
with
this.
so
that
distinguishes
it.
now
in
addition
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
they
continue
to
believe
that
serious
question
on
this
score
that
is
score
of
competitive
consequences
remain
to
be
investigated
i
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
fortas
i
think
maybe
i
should
read
from
their,
from
their
initial
submission
in
this
connection
because
i
read
what
they
said
there
to
mean
that
they
continue
to
have
that
view
although
its
somewhat
more
ambiguously
stated.
what
they
say
in
their
initial
submission
to
the
commission
states
our
position
succinctly.
there
the
government
said
that
petitioner,
that
is
the
government,
asserts
that
the
application
places
before
the
commission
serious
questions
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
which
by
virtue
of
section
11
thereof
the
commission
has
a
duty
to
enforce.
greyhound
will
if
the
commission
approves
this
application
to
acquire
a
substantial
stock
interest
etc,
and
they
go
ahead,
and
then
they
conclude
therefore
the
commission
in
accordance
with
its
responsibilities
under
section
11
cannot
avoid
determining
to
what
extent,
depending
the
proposed
transactional
result
and
effects
of
section
7
is
intended
to
prevent.
i
think
that's
a
somewhat
clear
statement
than
what
they
have
in
their
brief
now.
maybe
they
intend
to
repeat
from
it.
if
they
don't
in
any
event
if
they
adhere
to
that
then
they
would
be
on
our
side
in
opposing
a
postponement
on
the
ground
if
there
was
no
prospect
of
ultimate
success
in
the
litigation.
in
addition
i
would
think
that
on
the
section
5
issue,
certainly
there
is
a
substantial
question.
now
with
respect
to
the
temporary
restraining
order
problem
mr.
justice
white
there
is
another
difference
i
think
and
that
is
that
the
commission
does
operate
here
within
a
statutory
framework.
section
20a
(2)
requires
that
if
determined
that
the
transaction
is
compatible
with
the
public
interest
and
for
a
lawful
object.
now
in
the
penn
central
case,
the
solicitor
general
was
here
arguing
that
the
commission
couldn't
truncate
its
procedures
the
way
it
did.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
no
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
don't.
i
am
just
saying
that
in
a
certain
sense
they
involve
the
same
kind
of
procedural
problems.
i
might
suggest
that
i
think
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
problems
that
the
government
avoids
here
by
virtue
of
the
doctrinal
argument
that
they
are
making
is
that
it
is
not
relevant.
penn
central
is
not
relevant
at
all
if
public
interest
doesn't
include
any
question
other
than
fiscal
soundness
of
the
proposed
transaction.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
they
are
estopped
or
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
sort,
but
that
the
problem
of
the
statutory
framework
is
one
that
does
exists.
if
they
must
make
a
determination
with
respect
to
the
public
interest
and
if
that
does
include
as
we
say
as
an
ingredient
the
anticompetitive
impact
of
the
transaction
then
we
suggest
that
it
is
different
than
an
regular
restraining
order
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
if
there
was
a
section
5
proceeding?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
railroad
motor
carrier
case
of
course
it
comes
in
specifically
section
5.
if
it's
not
a
railroad
motor
case
then
i
take
it,
it
comes
in
either
under
--
i
take
it
comes
in
under
the
public
interest
standard
of
section
5,
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right,
but
it
isn't
the
only
reason
though.
it
isn't
only
the
mclean
line
of
decisions
that's
relevant
here,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
also
california
versus
federal
power
commission,
the
rca
case,
every
case
that
this
court
has
decided
that
we've
been
able
to
find
involving
the
question
whether
a
term
like
public
interest
includes
reference
to
anticompetitive
factors,
has
gone
the
same
way.
the
court
has
always
said
that
it
does.
every
lower
court
decision
that
we
found
goes
the
same
way.
we
don't
say
they
are
controlling
authority,
but
certainly
it
seems
to
us
that
they're
instructed.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
that
we
do
have
a
better
case,
it
seems
it's
a
little
easier
to
argue
but
as
--
in
point
of
fact
i
don't
suggest
that
the
case
should
come
out
any
differently.
i
think
that
if
the
government
is
right
in
suggesting
that
the
--
if
the
commission
had
acted
the
way
that
we
say
it
should
have
acted,
to
have
produced
absurd
results
that
that's
a
very
good
ground
for
thinking
that
our
doctrinal
analysis
is
wrong
one
way
or
another.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we're
right
in
suggesting
that
there
were
no
difficult
practical
problems
involved
here,
that
there
may
very
well
be
damaged,
we
maybe
injured,
the
public
interest
maybe
injured
then
i
would
think
that
whether
you
put
it
under
20a
(2)
or
whether
you
put
it
under
5,
under
11
and
coordinated
enforcement
of
this
network
of
statutes,
you
really
ought
to
come
out
the
same
way.
but
--
well
let
me
say
one
more
thing
though
in
that
connection.
i
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
administrative
procedure
that
we
would
urge
that
it's
more
desirable
to
read
the
statute
so
as
to
include
these
factors
so
that
one
doesn't
get
into
this
problem
continuously
about
whether
the
commission
abused
it's
discretion
in
not
bringing
a
section
7
proceeding
immediately
or
waiting
50
days
or
waiting
an
year
or
whatever
it
might
be,
similarly
with
the
section
5
proceeding.
i
think
when
the
congress
says
that
the
commission
must
determine
that
a
transaction
is
in
the
public
interest
before
it
authorizes
it,
that
then
the
commission
is
on
notice
that
it's
got
to
be
on
some
fashion
at
least
with
every
ingredient
of
the
public
interest,
everything
that
touches
the
public
interest
in
a
decently
immediate
way.
so
that
i
think
there
is
some
purpose
in
reading
the
statute
that
way
in
terms
of
the
operation
of
the
agency.
the
question
of
impact
on
the
appellants
i
think
is
important
here,
it's
one
of
the
practical
considerations
that
the
government
advances.
and
as
to
that,
i
think
one
can't
say,
and
this
would
be
relevant
to
the
temporary
restraining
order
situation
also,
i
think
one
cannot
say
with
any
reasonable
degree
of
certitude
precisely
what
the
risks
are
going
to
be
here.
there
are
too
many
contingency.
the
60-day
offer
might
come
out
in
a
variety
of
different
ways,
but
what
one
can
say
it
seems
to
me
fairly
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
some
kind
and
that
root,
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
approved
this
basic
20%
transaction
and
that
transaction
is
going
to
be
in
effect
whatever
is
done
with
respect
to
instituting
a
section
5
proceeding
or
a
section
11
proceeding
in
the
future.
now,
we
have
motorbus
carriers
who
alleged
before
the
commission
that
their
degree
of
profitability,
their
measure
of
profitability
basically
turned
upon
express
carriage.
so
that
we
have
people
who
are
in
a
peculiarly
vulnerable
position.
the
proceeding,
if
there's
one,
may
last
for
two
or
three
years.
everyone
agrees
it
would
be
protracted.
so
the
government
suggests
though
that,
well,
perhaps
the
commission
could
do
something
such
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
might
be
done
in
a
temporary
restraining
order
case
in
order
to
protect
the
parties.
perhaps
they
could
impose
an
interim
condition
on,
if
they
began
a
section
5
proceeding,
perhaps
they
can
put
the
stock
in
a
boarding
trust
or
direct
the
greyhound
directors
not
sit
on
the
rea
board.
well,
perhaps
they
could,
but
no
one
knows
whether
they
will
and
if
one
must
measure
the
probabilities,
one
i
think
must
consider
that
they
did
not
do
that
in
this
proceeding
where
they
could.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
under
section
20,
i
think
indisputably
true
that's
their
position
under
section
20.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
that
is
their
position.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
burden
of
truth
is
on
the
applicant
under
section
20.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
the
opposite
would
be
true
under
section
11,
now
under
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
under
section
5
i
would
say
that
there
too
the
--
well,
if
it's
an
application
for
approval
and
of
course
the
applicant
has
the
burden
of
approval.
if
the
commission
is
investigating
frankly
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'm
just
not
sure,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
certainly
however
under
section
11
case
the
burden
would
be
different.
i
might
say
that
with
respect
to
the
penn
central
case,
i'm
not
an
expert
in
that
litigation,
it's
terribly
complex,
but
i
might
say
this
about
it,
that
in
that
proceeding
at
least
the
commission
tried.
now
this
court
may
hold
that
they
didn't
succeed,
but
at
least
they
tried
to
deal
with
all
factors
that
were
relevant
to
the
public
interest.
in
this
case,
they
didn't
even
try
we
say
what
we
think
we
have
here
is
the
kind
--
if
i
recall
judge
friendly's
opinion
there,
he
referred
to
a
case
that
one
does
not
meet
in
real
life,
where
the
commission
approves
the
transaction
while
deferring
all
the
consideration
of
factors
to
the
future
and
i
say
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
kind
of
case
in
real
life.
they
have
simply
put
the
matter
on
to
the
trial.
the
--
as
to
the
threshold
doctoral
question
of
the
scope
of
20a
(2),
the
appellees
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
is
controlling.
what
that
legislative
history
shows
is
that
when
the
congress
passed
the
securities
provision
the
problem
that
bothered
them
was
certainly
the
problem
of
fiscal
manipulation.
but
there
is
not
a
single
item
of
legislative
history
that
establishes
that
when
the
congress
employed
the
term
public
interest
and
lawful
object,
that
they
intended
that
the
commission
restrict
it's
consideration
to
problems
of
the
fiscal
soundness
of
the
issue.
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
to
that
effect
and
we
suggest
that
when
one
is
confronted
with
terms
in
their
natural
scope
would
include
anticompetitive
factors,
that
one
has
to
have
a
--
has
to
measure
up
to
a
very
strong
and
a
very
heavy
burden
of
proof
in
terms
of
legislative
history
to
this
conflict.
they
also
suggest
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
alleghany
case
is
controlling
here.
the
alleghany
case
of
course
as
the
court
knows
that
is
a
very
complex
body
of
litigation.
we've
gone
through
it
in
rather
laborious
detail
in
our
brief
i'm
afraid.
i
would
make
just
one
point
about
it
here.
we
don't
think
that
the
appellees
read
the
case
correctly,
neither
did
the
lower
court.
the
lower
court
thought
that
alleghany
was
not
controlling.
what
the
appellees
says
that
in
alleghany,
alleghany
ii,
the
second
per
curiam
decision,
this
court
held
that
section
5
questions
were
not
relevant
in
the
section
20a
(2)
proceedings.
as
i
say,
we
don't,
for
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
don't
read
it
in
that
way,
but
even
if
that's
right,
even
if
that's
what
the
court
meant
in
that
case,
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
case
because
of
the
character
of
the
section
5
issue
in
that
case.
there
the
section
5
question
was
the
allegedly
illegal
acquisition
of
the
new
york
central
by
alleghany
at
some
time
prior
to
the
section
20a
(2)
proceeding
and
the
securities
that
were
in
question
there
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
prior
acquisition
of
control.
it
was
just
an
exchange
of
one
kind
of
preferred
stock
for
another.
now
we
don't
say
that
in
a
section
20a
(2)
proceeding
the
commission
must
consider
every
past
misdeed
of
an
applicant.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
commission,
where
the
securities
issues
is
to
be
used
as
a
vehicle
for
acquiring
control
illegally
or
may
be,
and
where
it
is
to
be
used
as
an
instrument
for
the
violation
of
section
7
at
least
perhaps
that
the
commission
must
resolve
that
kind
of
section
5
problem
and
that
kind
of
section
7
problem
in
the
section
20a
(2)
proceeding
and
we
suggest
that
alleghany
however
it
may
be
read
doesn't
bear
on
that
problem
at
all.
i
think
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
no,
i
think
with
all
of
those
results
would
be
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
commission
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
brief
remarks
that
i
like
to
make.
so
far
as
the
practical
problem
that
the
commission
speaks
about
here,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
major
justification
they
present
for
going
ahead
with
this
acquisition
transaction
before,
result
with
these
problems,
that
i
say,
they
say
that
the
commission
under
my
view
would
have
to
deal
with
this
peacefully.
now,
that
isn't
so.
i
spent
sometime
in
my
opening
argument
dealing
with
the
possibility
if
the
commission
wish
to
do
it
by
simply
having
this
contract
reformed
and
all
it
would
be
involved,
would
be
move
the
60-day
period
back.
now
the
only
response
that
has
been
made
to
that
is
one
that
the
--
this
would
give
the
appellant
railroads
another
chance
to
block
the
transactions
which
it
is
said
they
did
twice.
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
the
twice
involve
situations
where
the
right
of
first
purchase
was
in
question,
that
is
to
say
outstanding
stock,
50%
acquisition.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
acquisition
of
the
500,000
shares,
which
we
cannot
block
because
over
80%
of
the
rea
stockholders
voted
for
this
transaction.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
--
rather
been
raised.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas
and
we
don't
really
see
that
a
double
proceeding
would
be
necessary
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
anticompetitive
problems
involved
could
be
dealt
with
at
the
outset
even
without
this
kind
of
information.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white
that's
right.
in
addition
it
said
that
we
didn't
suggest
this
until
this
court,
is
not
precisely
correct.
we
did
suggested
in
the
lower
court
but
in
any
events
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned
this
is
not
a
private
party
litigation.
this
is
a
section
20a(2)
proceeding
in
which
it's
the
commission's
responsibility
to
protect
the
public
interest.
so
that
whether
or
not
a
private
party
makes
a
point.
we
didn't
have
much
of
a
chance
because
they
weren't
any
briefs,
there
were
no
arguments
just
petitions
to
intervene,
which
were
denied
or
which
were
granted
and
request
for
hearing
which
were
denied
and
the
petitions
for
rehearing.
but
in
any
event,
it's
the
commission's
responsibility
do
bear
a
statutory
burden
you're
not
the
private
parties.
now,
so
far
as
what
may
happen,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
real
difference
here.
there
will
be,
everyone
agrees
if
there
is
a
proceeding
two
or
three
year
proceeding
damage
maybe
done
in
the
interim
and
we
are
not
comforted
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
may
or
may
not
try
to
insulate
this
transaction
in
the
interim
period.
we
don't
see
any
judicial
review
that
we'd
have
available
if
they
chose
not
to
do.
and
so
far
as
the
prospects
of
a
proceeding
has
been
brought
or
concerned,
we
are
not
very
comforted
there
either
by
the
fact
in
this
court
it
appears
that
there
seems
to
be
agreement
as
to
what
has
gone
because
after
all
it
is
up
to
the
commission.
thank
you.
