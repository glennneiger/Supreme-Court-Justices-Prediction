mr.
justice
bernnan
who
are
the
united
states?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
mean
anti-trust
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
may
i
just
ask
mr.
dempsey?
i
know
this,
you
ask
alternatively
a
remand
to
conduct
a
hearing
under
section
5
on
anticompetitive
impact
or
allowing
the
application
without
qualification
but
the
record
doesn't
deal
will
all
of
that
or
finally
deny
the
application
will
lead
to
clause,
have
you
any
further
--?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
you
got
them
too?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
ratify
two
cues,
one
of
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
let's
see
it,
what
is
that?
i
gather
what
you
now
have
is
the
authorization
to
go
through
the
purchase
of
the
500,000
shares?
mr.
justice
bernnan
now,
under
mr.
dempsey's
position
it
would
not
that
be
set
aside
pending
further
proceeding?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
that's
pretty
big
difference,
isn't
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
what
i
say
whereas
if
you
prevail,
this
purchase
to
the
500,000
goes
through?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
then
pending
the
outcome
of
experience
with
the
tender
would
be
an
ultimate
determination
on
the
anticompetitive
aspect?
mr.
justice
bernnan
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
mr.
rifkind
can
there
be
any
scrambling
with
this
really
--
ultimately
the
transaction
is
disapproved
results
only
in
the
stock
going
back
to
rea
and
the
money
going
back
to
greyhound
or
is
there
any
other
unscrambling
involved?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
i
am
what
i
am
getting
at
is
all
that's
involved
then
is
the
divestiture
of
the
stock?
mr.
justice
bernnan
there
would
be
no
combination
as
in
penn
central
in
a
lot
of
facilities.
mr.
justice
bernnan
there
is
plenty
of
material
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
once
20%
acquisition
takes
effect,
these
people
propose
to
go
right
ahead
and
to
consolidate
operations
just
as
they
made
in
penn
central.
