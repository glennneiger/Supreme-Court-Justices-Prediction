chief

does
the

concede
that
a
matter
would
be
ripe
for
a
discussion
of
section
7
and
section
5,
when
this
section
8
provision
is
finally
completed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barr.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
this
60-day
provision
couldn't
have
been
fulfilled
before
the
commission
acted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
which
event
perhaps
a
question
of
whether
section
7
or
5
applies,
would
be
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
i
find
in
the
record,
the
stated
reason
of
the
commission
as
to
why
this
was
not
required
–?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
they
didn't
wait
until
60-day
provision
was
exercised?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
was
my
question.
was
there
anything
in
the
records
stating
the
reason
by
the
commission
for
not
waiting
until
that
60-day
provision
had
been
exercised?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
are
giving
me
your,
your
reasons
why
but
not
the
commission's
reasons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
understood
that
but
is
that
supported
by
any
finding
or
any
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
anything
that
it,
that
it
put
him
a
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
percentage,
the
line
of
commerce
these
two
companies
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
it
includes
only
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
actually
limits
this
to
fiscal
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why,
what
do
we
rely
on
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any,
any
cases
in
this
area
which
holds
that
the
public
convenience
or
necessity
incorporates
only
fiscal
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
posture
of
this
case
quite
similar
to
that
of
penn
central
so
far
as
truncating
the
actions
of
the
commission
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
the
position
of
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
want
to
have
penn
central
to
be
reargued
i
thought
that
the
both
sides
agree
that
penn
central
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
the
commission
to
determine
certain
things
and
the
only
question
was
whether
it
had
the
right
to
delay
those
things
until
a
time
when
it
felt
that
those
matters
were
ripe
for
decision
and
as
i
understood
it,
the
government
[inaudible]
as
this
can't
be
the
time
because
if
we
do
a
couple
of
unscrambling,
they
will
probably
set
forth
in
many
ways
and
the
government
argued
very
earnestly
in
that
case
that
that
wasn't
proper
time.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
just
what
the
difference
is
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought
here
the
valid
purpose
of
this
transaction
was
to
consolidate
the
terminals
and
to
consolidate
runs
and
all
of
those
things,
which
under
this
agreement
can
be
commenced
at
any
time
and
if
they
wait
until
those
things
are
done
and
terminals
are
closed
and
so
forth
how
can
it
--
how
can
we
unscramble
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
in
penn
state
or
penn
central?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you,
do
you
use
the
same
standard
for
determining
public
interest
as
railroads
as
rea
does
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
think,
you
don't
think
that
anticompetitive
factors
are
involved
in
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
20a?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
in
some
circumstances,
it
would?
