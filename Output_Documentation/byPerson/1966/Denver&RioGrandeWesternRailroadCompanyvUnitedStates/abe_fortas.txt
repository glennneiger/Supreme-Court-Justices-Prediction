justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
did
the
commission
make
any
findings
as
to
competitive
affect
regardless
of
the
statutory
parameters?
justice
abe
fortas
i've
had
some
difficulty
reading
these
papers
with
respect
to
clarifying
now
and
understanding
on
that
point,
but
you
do
think
that
the
commission
did
not
make
any
findings
as
to
competitive
effect
which
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
-–
mean
that
i
suppose
that
the
commission
thought
that
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
20
does
not
require
a
finding
as
to
competitive
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
understand
i
am
making,
in
this
question
i
am
making
a
distinction
between
section
7
section
5
on
the
one
hand
and
the
factor
of
competitive
effect
on
the
other
hand
as
arguably
part
of
the
public
interest
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
explanation
why
they
did
that
rather
than
settling
it
at
the
same
time?
justice
abe
fortas
it
sounds,
it
sounds
rather
peculiar.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
your
point
is
that
one
cannot
help
taking
back
that
it
cannot
loan?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
or
do
you
not
take
the
position
that
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
20
includes
competitive
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
the
department
of
justice,
including
the
antitrust
division,
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
walking,
marching
arm-in-arm,
hand-in-hand
at
this
stage
of
this
case,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
at
least
they
have
filed
a
brief
here
stating
the
position
of
both?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
opposed
this
acquisition,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
somewhere
along
the
line
the
department
had
a
second
thought
and
changed
its
position?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
now
both
take
the
position
they
either
i
am
not
sure,
see
to
--
which
one
it
is
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
take
position,
that
section
20
does
not
include
a
public
interest
standard
or
that
in
that
alternative
addressing,
serves
your
alternative
theory
that
the
commission
is
justified
in
close
calling
consideration
of
section
7
and
section
5?
justice
abe
fortas
this
possible
disagreement
as
to
what
happens
hereafter?
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
beg
your
pardon
but
in
that
little
part,
the
united
states
[inaudible]
all
united
states
says
here
that
they,
that
it
ought
to
be
investigated,
they
don't
say
that
[inaudible]
to
say
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
section
7.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
feel
quite
as
so
far
they
said
there
would
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
public
interest
does
include
competitive
question
then
you
are
saying
it
is
highly
arguable
that
taking
a
position
here
which
is
opposite
to
the
position
what
they
took
in
penn
central?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
threshold
legal
position
here
mean
that
they
--
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
of
the
united
states
and
the
icc
take
the
position
under
section
20,
for
example,
that
the
new
york
central
could
sell
x
percent
of
it's
stock
to
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
that
the
commission
would
pass
upon
that
without
regard
to
competitive
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
if
that
is
their
position
and
the
commission's
position
is
they
could
defer
it
indefinitely
or
defer
to
a
later
date
the
consideration
of
the
anticompetitive
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
actually
there
would
be
a
different
[inaudible]
truth
would
there
not,
if
public
interest
under
section
20
repeals
anticompetitive
effect,
would
the
burden
of
proof
be
one
the
applicant?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
--
and
the
same
thing
would
be
true
under
section
11,
section
7,
that
the
burden
of
--
i
mean
say
the
opposite
would
be
true,
the
burden
--
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
section
5?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
work
mr.
barr?
do
the
railroads
have
right
of
first
refusal
if
greyhound
calls
for
tender?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
in
the
agreement,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
the
railroad
stop
greyhound
or
anybody
else
from
calling
for
tenders
--?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
tender
will
be
made
by
the
individual
stockholder,
will
it
not
or
do
i
misunderstand
this?
justice
abe
fortas
to
greyhound.
justice
abe
fortas
from,
they
have
that
right
from
greyhound?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
haven't
read
the
document
and
i
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
greyhound
--
i
guess
we
have
to
assume
that
greyhound
intends
to
go
through
with
the
terms
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
how
is
control
applied
in
section
20
or
perhaps
is
it
section
20?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
there
a
phrase
control
or
power
to
control
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
my
question
should
have
been
asked
with
respect
to
section
5
and
section
5
does
say
--?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
like
the
definition
in
some
of
sec
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon--
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
ask
sir
the
appellants
here
have
characterized
themselves
as
minority
stockholders
of
rea.
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
stock
they
represent?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
are
some
stockholders
who
presumably
are
in
favor
of
this?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
i
asked
that
question
and
you
mentioned
your
pessimistic
forecast
as
to
the
results
of
the
call
for
tenders
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
difficulty
is
implicit
in
that
is
that
if
greyhound
stocks
had
20%
and
the
commission
seems
to
imply
that
they
will
have
to
look
into
anticompetitive
aspects.
first
greyhound
changed
its
mind,
does
not
exercise
its
option
and
then
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
let's
suppose
it
exercised
its
option
and
then
they
get
any
of
the
stock
and
it
seems
to
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
be
implicit
here
that
the
commission
knew
that
they
will
vary
from
dynamic
competitive
--
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
it
will
be
not
be
possible
by
reasonably
20%
stock
interest
or
operating
consolidations
and
changes
to
be
effective
that
is
to
say
consolidation
of
facilities
and
services
between
greyhound
and
railway
express
agency.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
regard
that
as
immaterial?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
changes
could
be
made,
there
could
be
a
consolidation
of
operating
stations,
places
where
freight
is
received,
facilities
for
the
handling
of
freight
and
so
on,
immediately
after
the
20%
acquisition
is
effective,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
but
in
some
other
cases
i've
heard
so
many
of
your
colleagues
up
here
arguing
about
the
impossibility
of
something
called
unscrambling
and
you're
satisfied
that
there
would
be
no
problem
about
unscrambling
here?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
an
unscramble
of
proforma
so
that
if
the
20%
acquisition
is
approved
and
the
separate
eggs
are
scrambled
and
an
omelet
emerges,
it's
unscrambled.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
real
question
is
not
the
divestiture
of
the
stock
if
i
understand
accurately
i
heard
you
fellows
in
other
cases
but
it's
a
question
of
what
happens
to
the
operating
facilitates
and
whether
the
words
would
be
changed
but
the
malady
would
linger
on
by
means
of
the
consolidation
etc
of
the
operating
facilities.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rifkind,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
delay
of
just
60
days,
are
we
and
let's
say
they
possibly
the
effectuation
of
a
tender
offer,
we're
talking
about
a
delay
which
will
probably
extend
into
many,
many
months,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
have
to
get
approval
of
the
icc
then?
justice
abe
fortas
for
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
under
the
tender
offer.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
has
been
approved
here.
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
raises
questions
under
5.
justice
abe
fortas
the
approval
would
be
necessary,
wouldn't
it
or
have
they
conceded
that
too?
justice
abe
fortas
what
make
you
say,
what's
the
basis
for
that
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
commission
order
to
that
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
mr.
rifkind
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
issue.
question
is
whether
under
20a
the
public
interest
standard
when
in
view
of
the
department
of
justice
does
or
does
not
mean
that
the
commission
has
to
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
competitive
or
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
stock
acquisition.
now,
what
is
your
position
on
that
question?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
mean
it
says
--
i
don't
understand
that.
what
is
the
law,
what's
you
construction
on
the
law?
does
the
law
or
does
the
law
not
require
you
that
they
require
the
commission
to
make
such
findings.
now,
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
place
for
ambiguity.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
got
to
say
that
the
statute
does
not
require
that
the
commission
make
findings
with
respect
to
competitive
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
new
york
central
let's
say
had
acquired
x
percent,
a
substantial
block
of
the
stock
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
then
it's
your
position
that
the
commission
would
not
have
been
required
by
section
20a
to
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
anticompetitive
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
there's
no
reality
to
it
as
turning
in
one
batch
of
stock
for,
stock
in
one
company
for
by
the
different
kind
of
an
ownership
instrument.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
heard
of
instances
where
the
antitrust
division
and
those
other
agencies
and
government
have
concerned
themselves
quite
competent
to
appraise
competitive
or
anticompetitive
effects
of
maintenance
of
a
–
of
a,
the
acquisition
of
a
substantial
block
of
stock
at
the
threshold
you
even
saw
in
preliminary
injunction.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
did
the
commission
make
any
findings
as
to
competitive
affect
regardless
of
the
statutory
parameters?
justice
abe
fortas
i've
had

will
have
to
look
into
anticompetitive
aspects.
first
greyhound
changed
its
mind,
does
not
exercise
its
option
and
then
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
let's
suppose
it
exercised
its
option
and
then
they
get
any
of
the
stock
and
it
seems
to
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
be
implicit
here
that
the
commission
knew
that
they
will
vary
from
dynamic
competitive
--
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
it
will
be
not
be
possible
by
reasonably
20%
stock
interest
or
operating
consolidations
and
changes
to
be
effective
that
is
to
say
consolidation
of
facilities
and
services
between
greyhound
and
railway
express
agency.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
regard
that
as
immaterial?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
changes
could
be
made,
there
could
be
a
consolidation
of
operating
stations,
places
where
freight
is
received,
facilities
for
the
handling
of
freight
and
so
on,
immediately
after
the
20%
acquisition
is
effective,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
but
in
some
other
cases
i've
heard
so
many
of
your
colleagues
up
here
arguing
about
the
impossibility
of
something
called
unscrambling
and
you're
satisfied
that
there
would
be
no
problem
about
unscrambling
here?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
an
unscramble
of
proforma
so
that
if
the
20%
acquisition
is
approved
and
the
separate
eggs
are
scrambled
and
an
omelet
emerges,
it's
unscrambled.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
real
question
is
not
the
divestiture
of
the
stock
if
i
understand
accurately
i
heard
you
fellows
in
other
cases
but
it's
a
question
of
what
happens
to
the
operating
facilitates
and
whether
the
words
would
be
changed
but
the
malady
would
linger
on
by
means
of
the
consolidation
etc
of
the
operating
facilities.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rifkind,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
delay
of
just
60
days,
are
we
and
let's
say
they
possibly
the
effectuation
of
a
tender
offer,
we're
talking
about
a
delay
which
will
probably
extend
into
many,
many
months,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
have
to
get
approval
of
the
icc
then?
justice
abe
fortas
for
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
under
the
tender
offer.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
has
been
approved
here.
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
raises
questions
under
5.
justice
abe
fortas
the
approval
would
be
necessary,
wouldn't
it
or
have
they
conceded
that
too?
justice
abe
fortas
what
make
you
say,
what's
the
basis
for
that
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
commission
order
to
that
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
mr.
rifkind
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
issue.
question
is
whether
under
20a
the
public
interest
standard
when
in
view
of
the
department
of
justice
does
or
does
not
mean
that
the
commission
has
to
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
competitive
or
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
stock
acquisition.
now,
what
is
your
position
on
that
question?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
mean
it
says
--
i
don't
understand
that.
what
is
the
law,
what's
you
construction
on
the
law?
does
the
law
or
does
the
law
not
require
you
that
they
require
the
commission
to
make
such
findings.
now,
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
place
for
ambiguity.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
got
to
say
that
the
statute
does
not
require
that
the
commission
make
findings
with
respect
to
competitive
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
new
york
central
let's
say
had
acquired
x
percent,
a
substantial
block
of
the
stock
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
then
it's
your
position
that
the
commission
would
not
have
been
required
by
section
20a
to
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
anticompetitive
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
there's
no
reality
to
it
as
turning
in
one
batch
of
stock
for,
stock
in
one
company
for
by
the
different
kind
of
an
ownership
instrument.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
heard
of
instances
where
the
antitrust
division
and
those
other
agencies
and
government
have
concerned
themselves
quite
competent
to
appraise
competitive
or
anticompetitive
effects
of
maintenance
of
a
–
of
a,
the
acquisition
of
a
substantial
block
of
stock
at
the
threshold
you
even
saw
in
preliminary
injunction.
