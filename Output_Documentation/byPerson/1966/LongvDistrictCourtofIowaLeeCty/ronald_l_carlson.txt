mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.the
petitioner,
your
honor,
in
this
case
is
an
indigent
inmate
at
fort
madison
penitentiary
in
iowa
and
i
have
been
appointed
by
this
court
to
present
his
course
to
the
court.
petitioner,
mr.
long
was
arrested
in
iowa
on
april
9th
of
1963.
on
april
10th
he
was
taken
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
where
his
preliminary
occurrence.
at
that
time,
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
and
as
the
record
shows
in
the
case,
a
plea
of
“guilty”
was
recorded.
the
petitioner
being
indigent,
your
honors,
was
incarcerated
for
some
six
months
before
he
came
up
for
trial
in
october
of
1963.
at
that
time,
no
less
than
11
questions
were
directed
at
the
petitioner
concerning
admissions
that
he
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
some
of
these
questions
were
objected
to
and
the
objections
were
sustained
but
others
he
was
forced
to
answer.
he
was
convicted
of
larceny
in
iowa
and
the
jury
there
sets
the
amount
of
the
thing
in
value
which
he
stole
in
this
case,
it
was
a
pump
which
was
valued
at
$25.
he
was
sentenced
to
four
months
in
penitentiary
for
a
term
not
to
exceed
five
years.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
he
had
appointed
counsel
at
his
trial,
and
this
was
only
trial.
now
his
court-appointed
counsel
did,
your
honor,
appeal
the
case
but
the
appeal
did
not
raise
the
white
vs.
maryland
point
which
we
have
urged
to
the
court
that
exists
on
his
habeas
corpus
claims
here.
the
appeal
on
the
case
involved
itself
for
the
lack
of
speedy
trial.
the
iowa
supreme
court
deemed
his
delay
regrettable
in
getting
to
trial
but
affirmed
his
conviction
and
thereafter,
well,
at
fort
madison
penitentiary,
he
filed
the
action
which
now
brings
this
cause
to
the
court.
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
certain
claims
including
the
fact
that
his
court
appointed
counsel
was
incompetent
and
that
he
was
denied
his
white
vs.
maryland
rights
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
lee
county
district
court,
which
is
the
county
wherein
fort
madison
penitentiary
is
located,
set
the
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
the
cause
came
on
for
evidentiary
trial
at
which
time
witnesses
were
called
and
evidence
taken
on
the
petitioner's
habeas
corpus
claims.
the
lee
county
district
court
dismissed
the
petitioner's
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
an
order
stating
that
the
petitioner
had
not
carried
the
burden
or
for
other
reasons
the
claims
were
not
viable.
the
petitioner
filed
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
from
his
denial
of
habeas
corpus
and
thereafter
filed
an
application
for
a
transcript
of
his
evidentiary
hearing
for
purposes
of
preparing
a
meaningful
appeal
on
the
habeas
corpus
denial
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
lee
county
district
court
passed
upon
the
application
for
transcript
and
it
stated
in
an
order
denying
the
application
for
transcript
that
habeas
corpus
being
a
civil
proceeding
in
iowa,
there
was
no
right
to
the
transcript
of
the
evidentiary
hearing.
petitioner
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
--
his
appeal
is
still
pending
at
this
time,
your
honors
--
requesting
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
enter
an
order
directing
that
he
receive
a
transcript
of
his
evidentiary
hearing.
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
at
this
time
summarily
denied
his
application
for
certiorari,
citing
to
the
case
of
waldon
vs.
district
court.
in
the
cited
case,
the
waldon
case,
credence
was
again
given
to
the
civil
label
of
habeas
corpus.
as
a
means,
we
submit
of
denying
constitutionally
protected
rights.
petitioner
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
the
matter
comes
on
for
hearing
on
the
question
of,
is
the
petitioner
entitled
on
an
appeal
from
a
habeas
corpus
denial
to
a
transcript
under
equal
protection
of
the
law?
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
when
he
took
his
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
where
he
was
convicted
on
his
felony
of
larceny
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
he
obtained
a
transcript
of
the
original
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
what
he
wants
here
is
a
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
trial,
the
evidence
presented
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
oh,
there
were
basically
four
issues
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
stewart,
including
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
his
preliminary
hearing.
at
which
time,
a
plea
of
“guilty”
was
recorded
and
he
was
interrogated
on
his
original
trial
as
to
admissions
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
could
have
been,
mr.
justice
stewart
but
counsel
is
not
provided
on
habeas
corpus
in
iowa
and
this
was
not
presented
to
the
court.
our
point
here
is
this,
however,
your
honors,
the
original
trial
transcript
would
not
reflect
the
particular
point
raised
in
habeas
corpus
here,
that
is,
the
original
transcript
would
not
reflect
whether
or
not
long
was
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
he
was
represented
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
right,
your
honor.
and
this
could
only
have
been
developed,
we
submit
by
evidentiary
matter
presented
on
habeas
corpus
on
which
point
of
evidence
was
taken
and
that
issue
was
resolved
against
the
petitioner
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
no,
your
honor.
the
issue
was
decided
factually
that
he
had
had
counsel
at
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
as
i
recall,
there
was
evidence
presented
by
the
county
attorney
from
the
county
which
had
convicted
long.
i
believe
another
police
officer
had
testified
on
the
point
and
long
himself
testified
contradictory
matter
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
now
on
review,
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
must
adjudicate
whether
this
finding
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
and
our
point
is,
that
the
reviewing
court
cannot
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
there
are
two
propositions
that
apply
here,
your
honors.
we
take
the
position
that
under
iowa
rule
340a
which
we
have
cited
the
court
to
that
the
rule
does
call
for
the
filing
of
a
transcript
to
present
any
evidentiary
record
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
on
an
appeal
of
this
kind.
now
the
attorney
general
takes
the
position
here
that
iowa
has
in
several
indigent
cases,
permitted
the
indigents
to
type
up
from
memory
of
their
own
narrative
of
the
facts
and
therefore,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
attorney
general
contends
to
file
this
transcript.
however,
it's
our
position
that
the
informal
waiver
on
a
few
prior
unreported
cases
does
not
constitute
a
standing
waiver
or
notice
to
this
indigent
that
he
need
not
file
the
transcript
which
is
called
for
in
that
rule.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
was.
they
were
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
in
a
district
court
matter,
court
reporters
are
always
provided,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
exception
to
that.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
has.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
appeal
is
still
pending.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
they
would
although
they
have,
as
i
say,
denied
our
application
for
that
transcript.
the
petitioner
himself
tried
to
obtain
the
transcript.
central
to
our
position
here,
your
honors,
is
the
point
that
appeal
is
a
matter
of
right
in
habeas
corpus
in
iowa.
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
was
able
to
appeal
his
denial
of
habeas
corpus
and
obtain
full
and
meaningful
appellant
review.
the
petitioner,
mr.
long
--
the
indigent
and
mr.
long's
position
is
precluded
from
doing
that.
he
–
basically,
he
is
in
the
position,
we
submit,
of
the
petitioner
in
lane
vs.
brown
or
the
defendants
in
griffin
vs.
illinois
being
foreclosed
from
meaningful
appeal
because
of
the
lack
of
transcript.
and,
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
the
griffin
is
made
applicable
for
post-conviction
remedies
by
virtue
of
smith
vs.
bennett,
which
case
arose
out
of
our
jurisdiction
as
well
as
lane
vs.
brown.
now
the
question
is,
is
a
transcript
necessary
to
obtain
meaningful
review
from
your
habeas
corpus
denial?
well,
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
recently
passed
on
this
connection
in
connection
with
direct
appeals.
in
the
case
of
weaver
v.
herrick,
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
the
iowa
supreme
court
was
presented
with
the
question,
what
is
necessary
for
meaningful
review
under
the
iowa
rules?
and
the
court
said
in
weaver
vs.
herrick
that
to
provide
the
indigent
with
any
kind
of
meaningful
appeal
under
the
iowa
appeal
rules,
a
full
transcript
is
necessary.
that
is
the
rule
on
iowa
on
direct
appeals.
question
is,
why
does
a
different
rule
prevail
in
habeas
corpus?
the
reason
is,
we
submit,
because
of
a
continuing
misconception
of
the
habeas
corpus
process.
we
point
out
that
in
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion,
representing
the
unanimous
consensus
of
the
court
in
smith
vs.
bennett,
court
said
that
the
choice
of
labels
should
not
continue
to
persist
as
a
means
for
suppressing
constitutionally
protected
rights.
however,
even
after
that
decision,
as
we
pointed
out,
the
use
of
the
civil
label
continues
to
persist
to
suppress
rights
which
are
necessary
in
this
case
to
obtain
meaningful
appeal.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
here
has
raised
some
possible
substitutes
for
a
transcript.
we
submit
that
these
are
inadequate
that
they
in
no
way
give
the
indigent
petitioner
as
meaningful
appeal
as
the
petitioner
with
funds,
first
of
all,
use
of
the
original
trial
transcript,
which
may
be
available
to
the
petitioner
here.
this
will
not
reflect
claims
not
contained
within
the
trial
record
itself.
such
things
perhaps
as
prejudicial
pre-trial
or
during
trial
publicity
which
may
not
be
in
the
trial
transcript
and
may
be
far
from
erasable
from
habeas
corpus.
such
things
as
threats
or
corrosions
on
a
defendant
which
will
not
show
up
in
the
printed
pages
of
the
record,
may
properly
be
raisable
in
habeas
corpus
and
therefore,
the
trial
transcript
would
not
operate
there.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
issue
of
that
kind,
no,
your
honor.
those
are
matters
that
i'm
simply
using
to
illustrate
the
point.
the
point
that
is
involved
here
is,
however,
this
white
vs.
maryland
point
which
does
not
show
up
in
the
trial
transcript
which
is
a
point
in
this
case.
and
i
must
say
the
attorney
general
here
has
commendably,
upon
the
review
of
this
record,
basically
conceded
the
point
that
it
appears
that
there
was
a
white
vs.
maryland
violation
here.
that
will
not
be
in
the
trial
transcript.
therefore,
an
evidentiary
transcript
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no.
oh,
excuse
me,
yes,
your
honor
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that
is
exactly,
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
we
cannot
review
whether
the
trial
court
was
correct
without
that
transcript.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
there
is
reference
to
it
in
the
record
or
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
of
the
respondent
and
i
have
also
alluded
to
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
just
in
this
court.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
sure.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
that
is
not
the
reference,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
if
you
go
to
page
20,
please
of
the
respondent's
brief
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor,
page
20.
as
the
record
reflects,
long
was
brought
before
justice
of
peace
of
w.
minor
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
at
which
time,
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
what
i
did
when
i
prepared
the
record
here,
i
got
the
justice
of
the
peace
transcript
and
that
is
the
record
--
it's
the
record
before
this
court
that
we
are
referring
to;
not
the
trial
record
but
the
justice
of
the
peace
papers.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
referring
to
on
page
20,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
and
that
particular
point
of
fact
was,
as
i
say,
resolved
against
the
petitioner
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
that
is,
the
district
court
for
lee
county
found
that
he
didn't
in
fact
had
counsel.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
what
the
habeas
record
shows
are
the
conflicting
evidentiary
matters
on
whether
or
not
he
had
counsel
at
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
your
honor,
that
would
be
splendid
if
that
would
control
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
district
court
in
and
for
lee
county
has
found
this
fact
adverse
to
us.
and
when
it
goes
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
their
function
is
to
determine
if
the
trial
court
had
substantial
evidence
to
support
their
findings.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
is
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
i
say
i
think
counsel
here
has
commendably,
upon
a
review
of
the
record,
brought
this
to
our
attention.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
now.
i
suppose
the
concession
here
goes
to
the
point
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
there
is
the
additional
matter
for
litigation
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
used
against
to
me
adversely
or
prejudicially
at
the
trial
of
the
cause.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes
--
well,
no,
no
it
was
not.
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
trial
court's
order
on
this
says,
“we
find
the
petitioner
had
counsel
at
all
relevant
times”
and
that's
the
end
of
this
finding
of
fact
as
i
recall
on
that
point.
so
that's
where
we
are
left
but
--
this
is
why
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
this
concession
will
probably
not
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
was
also
that
additional
point
of
white
vs.
maryland
to
be
litigated
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
prejudicially
used
against
the
petitioner.
in
addition
to
that,
if
that
claim
would
be
lost,
there
are
other
claims
in
the
petitioners'
habeas
corpus
concerning
incompetency
of
counsel
and
things
of
that
nature
which
we
contend
the
transcript
is
necessary
to
show.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
as
i
see
the
concession
here,
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
clear
on
counsel
that
on
the
white
vs.
maryland
point,
as
you
properly
pointed
out,
with
some
reservation.
we
contend
also,
your
honors,
that
the
trial
transcript
in
habeas
corpus
now,
trial
transcript
in
habeas
corpus
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
don't
know
what
occurred
at
that
habeas
hearing
for
sure,
your
honor.
i've
got
to
get
that
transcript
to
see.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
could
be
that
my
petitioner
has
explored
that
and
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
submit
it
would
be
helpful,
mr.
justice
white,
have
that
didn't
introduce
that
evidentiarily
at
the
habeas
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
true.
the
trial
transcript
would
be--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
as
i
say
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
assuming
that
that
white
vs.
maryland
point
may
be
determined
adversely
against
me,
that
is
if
the
supreme
court
feels
that
the
trial
transcript
shows
that
white
vs.
maryland
was
not
violated
and
therefore,
i
lose
on
that
point.
i
have
additional
points
for
the
reason
of
this
habeas
corpus
petition
including
incompetency
of
counsel
and
including
also,
i
submit,
your
honor,
this,
whether
or
not
in
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
petitioner
contends
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
true.
however,
i
think
the
court
has
indicated
that
whether
the
court
has
made
an
accurate
and
adequate
investigation
of
the
case
may
not
be
completely
shown
by
what
the
pages
of
the
trial
indicate.
the
petitioner
here
has
alleged
specifically
that
counsel
lack
time
and
there
was
a
shift
of
appointed
counsels
shortly
before
the
trial
that
the
counsel
act--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
wouldn't
call
at
that,
your
honor.
it's
incumbent
upon
me
that
test
whether
this
man
had
a
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
see
that
he
had
a
fair
trial
in
habeas
corpus.
the
original
trial
transcript
won't
tell
me
that.
to
find
out
of
the
trial
judge
in
habeas
corpus
wrongfully
admitted
hearsay
whether
he
improperly
cut
off
my
client
from
testifying
on
relevant
matter.
all
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
essential
for
me
to
have
a
habeas
transcript
to
see
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
there's
no
proof
that
he
requested
counsel.
there's
no
provision
for
counsel
in
habeas
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
was
there.
he
was
permitted
to
ask
such
questions
as
he
wanted
of
the
state's
witnesses
and
also
to
make
an
argument.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
have.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
do.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
do,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
i'm
sure
that
he
can't
recollect
the
decisions
made
by
the
trial
court
on
the
admission
of
evidence
or
objections
made
things
of
this
nature.
it
seems
to
me
that
test
whether
he
got
a
fair
hearing
or
fair
trial,
i
need
the
transcript
to
look
at.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
appears
clear
to
me,
your
honor,
that
upon
looking
at
it
that
it
was
used.
as
i
say
11
questions
that
i
found
were
directed
to
admissions
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
some
of
those
were
objected
to
and
overruled
but
--
or
the
objection
was
sustained
but
on
some
points,
the
petitioner
was
required
to
answer.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
original
trial
transcript,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
can
tell
you
it
was
not
there
at
the
habeas
corpus,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
the
petitioner,
being
a
non-lawyer,
apparently
did
a
very
poor
job
permit
me
to
the
very
cord
job
of
putting
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
he
might
be
able
to
do
that.
they
have
rather
liberal
authority
to
order
up
other
record
material
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
they
could.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
now,
the
experience
of
the
states
following
smith
vs.
bennett
and
lane
vs.
brown
has
been
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
position
that
we
here
advocate.
at
least
30
states
give
habeas
corpus
appeals
as
a
matter
of
right
just
as
iowa.
and
of
those
30,
26
gave
a
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
to
the
petitioner
in
the
position
of
the
petitioner
whom
i
represent.
so,
we
think
that
the
experience
of
the
states
is
moving
in
the
very
direction
of
the
position
we
raised
to
this
court.
we
do
not
say
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
is
not
or
that
the
states
are
not
free
to
put
on
limiting
devices
on
perhaps
the
number
of
writs
that
can
be
filed
to
otherwise
police
what
they're
--
the
amount
of
habeas
corpus
applications
made
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is,
that
where
a
screening
device
depends
upon
poverty
as
this
one
does.
this
is
an
improper
screening
device.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honors,
i
will
briefly
addressed
myself
to
a
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
white
have
inquired
into
and
that
is,
“has
the
iowa
supreme
court
ever
afforded
transcripts
in
habeas
corpus?”
if
i
could
respond
with
perhaps
a
brief
quote,
your
honor,
from
the
latest
authority
i
could
find
on
the
point
which
is
hoskins
vs.
bennett
which
they
say
--
here
the
petitioner
also
had
requested
a
transcript
of
public
expenses
in
habeas
corpus.
the
trial
court
said
that
habeas
corpus
is
a
civil
proceeding
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
iowa
law
for
a
transcript
to
be
evidence
in
such
cases
at
public
expense.
this
is
true.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
hoskins
vs.
bennett.
i
just
have
the
iowa
here,
your
honor,
256
iowa,
citing
page
1376.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
1964.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
also,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
walden
vs.
district
court
which
our
supreme
court
ordered
in
this
case,
cites
2
gives
credence
to
this
civil
labeling
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
justice
white
also
asked
the
question,
had
the
iowa
court
ever
been
faced
with
the
potential
substitutes,
the
bystanders
bills
and
so
forth
that
mr.
bennett
here
has
suggested
in
this
case,
we
point
to
the
case
of
weaver
vs.
herrick,
decided
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
1966
in
which
the
question
came
to
the
supreme
court,
what
is
necessary
for
a
meaningful
appeal
to
indigents
in
iowa?
this,
in
connection
with
direct
criminal
causes,
first
appeal,
court
responded
emphatically.
of
course,
the
transcript
is
essential
for
this
kind
of
appeal.
the
reason
they
don't
do
it
in
habeas
corpus
we
submit,
is
because
of
the
civil
labeling.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
would
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
to
order
the
district
court
to
enter
to
prepare
a
transcript
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor,
although
the
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
we've
done
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
that's
legitimate
your
honor.
of
course,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
decision
perhaps
could
be
broader
and
say
that
where
evidentiary
hearings
are
had
as
in
this
case,
where
the
appellate
court
is
being
asked
to
review
evidentiary
matters,
obviously
without
a
transcript
of
the
petitioner
who
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
you
have
the
problem
arising
quite
analogously
in
griffin
vs.
illinois.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
my
response
would
be
on
that,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
case,
of
course,
our
petitioner
is
without
counsel
denied
that
by
the
state.
he
would
be
all
prepared
to
drudge
up
from
memory.
what
evidence
was
presented
at
the
trial
of
the
case
even
to
present
to
bystanders
to
affirm
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right
and
he
will
still
be.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
they
are.
they
certainly
could
promulgate
a
supreme
court
rule
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
they're
broad
enough
to
do
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
that
is
also
denied
him
under
the
civil
proceeding
rationale.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
civil
proceeding
rationale
is
--
well,
perhaps
i
should
pause
on
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
perhaps
i
should
pause
on
that.
i
would
feel
that
in
the
context
that
were
talking
about
here,
equal
protection
–
that
would
dictate
the
appointment
of
counsel
ultimately
but
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
on
counsel?
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
no,
that's
my
response.
[voice
overlap]
that
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i've
enjoyed
my
service
so
far,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
too
griever
prospect.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
for
sure.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.the
petitioner,
your
honor,
in
this
case
is
an
indigent
inmate
at
fort
madison
penitentiary
in
iowa
and
i
have
been
appointed
by
this
court
to
present
his
course
to
the
court.
petitioner,
mr.
long
was
arrested
in
iowa
on
april
9th
of
1963.
on
april
10th
he
was
taken
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
where
his
preliminary
occurrence.
at
that
time,
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
and
as
the
record
shows
in
the
case,
a
plea
of
“guilty”
was
recorded.
the
petitioner
being
indigent,
your
honors,
was
incarcerated
for
some
six
months
before
he
came
up
for
trial
in
october
of
1963.
at
that
time,
no
less
than
11
questions
were
directed
at
the
petitioner
concerning
admissions
that
he
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
some
of
these
questions
were
objected
to
and
the
objections
were
sustained
but
others
he
was
forced
to
answer.
he
was
convicted
of
larceny
in
iowa
and
the
jury
there
sets
the
amount
of
the
thing
in
value
which
he
stole
in
this
case,
it
was
a
pump
which
was
valued
at
$25.
he
was
sentenced
to
four
months
in
penitentiary
for
a
term
not
to
exceed
five
years.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
he
had
appointed
counsel
at
his
trial,
and
this
was
only
trial.
now
his
court-appointed
counsel
did,
your
honor,
appeal
the
case
but
the
appeal
did
not
raise
the
white
vs.
maryland
point
which
we
have
urged
to
the
court
that
exists
on
his
habeas
corpus
claims
here.
the
appeal
on
the
case
involved
itself
for
the
lack
of
speedy
trial.
the
iowa
supreme
court
deemed
his
delay
regrettable
in
getting
to
trial
but
affirmed
his
conviction
and
thereafter,
well,
at
fort
madison
penitentiary,
he
filed
the
action
which
now
brings
this
cause
to
the
court.
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
certain
claims
including
the
fact
that
his
court
appointed
counsel
was
incompetent
and
that
he
was
denied
his
white
vs.
maryland
rights
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
lee
county
district
court,
which
is
the
county
wherein
fort
madison
penitentiary
is
located,
set
the
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
the
cause
came
on
for
evidentiary
trial
at
which
time
witnesses
were
called
and
evidence
taken
on
the
petitioner's
habeas
corpus
claims.
the
lee
county
district
court
dismissed
the
petitioner's
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
an
order
stating
that
the
petitioner
had
not
carried
the
burden
or
for
other
reasons
the
claims
were
not
viable.
the
petitioner
filed
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
from
his
denial
of
habeas
corpus
and
thereafter
filed
an
application
for
a
transcript
of
his
evidentiary
hearing
for
purposes
of
preparing
a
meaningful
appeal
on
the
habeas
corpus
denial
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
lee
county
district
court
passed
upon
the
application
for
transcript
and
it
stated
in
an
order
denying
the
application
for
transcript
that
habeas
corpus
being
a
civil
proceeding
in
iowa,
there
was
no
right
to
the
transcript
of
the
evidentiary
hearing.
petitioner
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
--
his
appeal
is
still
pending
at
this
time,
your
honors
--
requesting
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
enter
an
order
directing
that
he
receive
a
transcript
of
his
evidentiary
hearing.
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
at
this
time
summarily
denied
his
application
for
certiorari,
citing
to
the
case
of
waldon
vs.
district
court.
in
the
cited
case,
the
waldon
case,
credence
was
again
given
to
the
civil
label
of
habeas
corpus.
as
a
means,
we
submit
of
denying
constitutionally
protected
rights.
petitioner
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
the
matter
comes
on
for
hearing
on
the
question
of,
is
the
petitioner
entitled
on
an
appeal
from
a
habeas
corpus
denial
to
a
transcript
under
equal
protection
of
the
law?
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
when
he
took
his
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
where
he
was
convicted
on
his
felony
of
larceny
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
he
obtained
a
transcript
of
the
original
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
what
he
wants
here
is
a
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
trial,
the
evidence
presented
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
oh,
there
were
basically
four
issues
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
stewart,
including
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
his
preliminary
hearing.
at
which
time,
a
plea
of
“guilty”
was
recorded
and
he
was
interrogated
on
his
original
trial
as
to
admissions
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
could
have
been,
mr.
justice
stewart
but
counsel
is
not
provided
on
habeas
corpus
in
iowa
and
this
was
not
presented
to
the
court.
our
point
here
is
this,
however,
your
honors,
the
original
trial
transcript
would
not
reflect
the
particular
point
raised
in
habeas
corpus
here,
that
is,
the
original
transcript
would
not
reflect
whether
or
not
long
was
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
he
was
represented
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
right,
your
honor.
and
this
could
only
have
been
developed,
we
submit
by
evidentiary
matter
presented
on
habeas
corpus
on
which
point
of
evidence
was
taken
and
that
issue
was
resolved
against
the
petitioner
on
habeas
corpus.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
no,
your
honor.
the
issue
was
decided
factually
that
he
had
had
counsel
at
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
as
i
recall,
there
was
evidence
presented
by
the
county
attorney
from
the
county
which
had
convicted
long.
i
believe
another
police
officer
had
testified
on
the
point
and
long
himself
testified
contradictory
matter
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
now
on
review,
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
must
adjudicate
whether
this
finding
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
and
our
point
is,
that
the
reviewing
court
cannot
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
there
are
two
propositions
that
apply
here,
your
honors.
we
take
the
position
that
under
iowa
rule
340a
which
we
have
cited
the
court
to
that
the
rule
does
call
for
the
filing
of
a
transcript
to
present
any
evidentiary
record
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
on
an
appeal
of
this
kind.
now
the
attorney
general
takes
the
position
here
that
iowa
has
in
several
indigent
cases,
permitted
the
indigents
to
type
up
from
memory
of
their
own
narrative
of
the
facts
and
therefore,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
attorney
general
contends
to
file
this
transcript.
however,
it's
our
position
that
the
informal
waiver
on
a
few
prior
unreported
cases
does
not
constitute
a
standing
waiver
or
notice
to
this
indigent
that
he
need
not
file
the
transcript
which
is
called
for
in
that
rule.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
was.
they
were
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
in
a
district
court
matter,
court
reporters
are
always
provided,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
exception
to
that.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
has.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
appeal
is
still
pending.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
they
would
although
they
have,
as
i
say,
denied
our
application
for
that
transcript.
the
petitioner
himself
tried
to
obtain
the
transcript.
central
to
our
position
here,
your
honors,
is
the
point
that
appeal
is
a
matter
of
right
in
habeas
corpus
in
iowa.
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
was
able
to
appeal
his
denial
of
habeas
corpus
and
obtain
full
and
meaningful
appellant
review.
the
petitioner,
mr.
long
--
the
indigent
and
mr.
long's
position
is
precluded
from
doing
that.
he
–
basically,
he
is
in
the
position,
we
submit,
of
the
petitioner
in
lane
vs.
brown
or
the
defendants
in
griffin
vs.
illinois
being
foreclosed
from
meaningful
appeal
because
of
the
lack
of
transcript.
and,
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
the
griffin
is
made
applicable
for
post-conviction
remedies
by
virtue
of
smith
vs.
bennett,
which
case
arose
out
of
our
jurisdiction
as
well
as
lane
vs.
brown.
now
the
question
is,
is
a
transcript
necessary
to
obtain
meaningful
review
from
your
habeas
corpus
denial?
well,
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
recently
passed
on
this
connection
in
connection
with
direct
appeals.
in
the
case
of
weaver
v.
herrick,
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
the
iowa
supreme
court
was
presented
with
the
question,
what
is
necessary
for
meaningful
review
under
the
iowa
rules?
and
the
court
said
in
weaver
vs.
herrick
that
to
provide
the
indigent
with
any
kind
of
meaningful
appeal
under
the
iowa
appeal
rules,
a
full
transcript
is
necessary.
that
is
the
rule
on
iowa
on
direct
appeals.
question
is,
why
does
a
different
rule
prevail
in
habeas
corpus?
the
reason
is,
we
submit,
because
of
a
continuing
misconception
of
the
habeas
corpus
process.
we
point
out
that
in
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion,
representing
the
unanimous
consensus
of
the
court
in
smith
vs.
bennett,
court
said
that
the
choice
of
labels
should
not
continue
to
persist
as
a
means
for
suppressing
constitutionally
protected
rights.
however,
even
after
that
decision,
as
we
pointed
out,
the
use
of
the
civil
label
continues
to
persist
to
suppress
rights
which
are
necessary
in
this
case
to
obtain
meaningful
appeal.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
here
has
raised
some
possible
substitutes
for
a
transcript.
we
submit
that
these
are
inadequate
that
they
in
no
way
give
the
indigent
petitioner
as
meaningful
appeal
as
the
petitioner
with
funds,
first
of
all,
use
of
the
original
trial
transcript,
which
may
be
available
to
the
petitioner
here.
this
will
not
reflect
claims
not
contained
within
the
trial
record
itself.
such
things
perhaps
as
prejudicial
pre-trial
or
during
trial
publicity
which
may
not
be
in
the
trial
transcript
and
may
be
far
from
erasable
from
habeas
corpus.
such
things
as
threats
or
corrosions
on
a
defendant
which
will
not
show
up
in
the
printed
pages
of
the
record,
may
properly
be
raisable
in
habeas
corpus
and
therefore,
the
trial
transcript
would
not
operate
there.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
issue
of
that
kind,
no,
your
honor.
those
are
matters
that
i'm
simply
using
to
illustrate
the
point.
the
point
that
is
involved
here
is,
however,
this
white
vs.
maryland
point
which
does
not
show
up
in
the
trial
transcript
which
is
a
point
in
this
case.
and
i
must
say
the
attorney
general
here
has
commendably,
upon
the
review
of
this
record,
basically
conceded
the
point
that
it
appears
that
there
was
a
white
vs.
maryland
violation
here.
that
will
not
be
in
the
trial
transcript.
therefore,
an
evidentiary
transcript
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no.
oh,
excuse
me,
yes,
your
honor
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that
is
exactly,
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
we
cannot
review
whether
the
trial
court
was
correct
without
that
transcript.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
there
is
reference
to
it
in
the
record
or
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
of
the
respondent
and
i
have
also
alluded
to
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
just
in
this
court.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
sure.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
that
is
not
the
reference,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
if
you
go
to
page
20,
please
of
the
respondent's
brief
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor,
page
20.
as
the
record
reflects,
long
was
brought
before
justice
of
peace
of
w.
minor
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
at
which
time,
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
what
i
did
when
i
prepared
the
record
here,
i
got
the
justice
of
the
peace
transcript
and
that
is
the
record
--
it's
the
record
before
this
court
that
we
are
referring
to;
not
the
trial
record
but
the
justice
of
the
peace
papers.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
referring
to
on
page
20,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
and
that
particular
point
of
fact
was,
as
i
say,
resolved
against
the
petitioner
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
that
is,
the
district
court
for
lee
county
found
that
he
didn't
in
fact
had
counsel.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
what
the
habeas
record
shows
are
the
conflicting
evidentiary
matters
on
whether
or
not
he
had
counsel
at
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
your
honor,
that
would
be
splendid
if
that
would
control
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
district
court
in
and
for
lee
county
has
found
this
fact
adverse
to
us.
and
when
it
goes
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
their
function
is
to
determine
if
the
trial
court
had
substantial
evidence
to
support
their
findings.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
is
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
i
say
i
think
counsel
here
has
commendably,
upon
a
review
of
the
record,
brought
this
to
our
attention.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
now.
i
suppose
the
concession
here
goes
to
the
point
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
there
is
the
additional
matter
for
litigation
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
used
against
to
me
adversely
or
prejudicially
at
the
trial
of
the
cause.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes
--
well,
no,
no
it
was
not.
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
trial
court's
order
on
this
says,
“we
find
the
petitioner
had
counsel
at
all
relevant
times”
and
that's
the
end
of
this
finding
of
fact
as
i
recall
on
that
point.
so
that's
where
we
are
left
but
--
this
is
why
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
this
concession
will
probably
not
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
was
also
that
additional
point
of
white
vs.
maryland
to
be
litigated
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
prejudicially
used
against
the
petitioner.
in
addition
to
that,
if
that
claim
would
be
lost,
there
are
other
claims
in
the
petitioners'
habeas
corpus
concerning
incompetency
of
counsel
and
things
of
that
nature
which
we
contend
the
transcript
is
necessary
to
show.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
as
i
see
the
concession
here,
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
clear
on
counsel
that
on
the
white
vs.
maryland
point,
as
you
properly
pointed
out,
with
some
reservation.
we
contend
also,
your
honors,
that
the
trial
transcript
in
habeas
corpus
now,
trial
transcript
in
habeas
corpus
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
don't
know
what
occurred
at
that
habeas
hearing
for
sure,
your
honor.
i've
got
to
get
that
transcript
to
see.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
could
be
that
my
petitioner
has
explored
that
and
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
submit
it
would
be
helpful,
mr.
justice
white,
have
that
didn't
introduce
that
evidentiarily
at
the
habeas
hearing.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
true.
the
trial
transcript
would
be--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
as
i
say
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
assuming
that
that
white
vs.
maryland
point
may
be
determined
adversely
against
me,
that
is
if
the
supreme
court
feels
that
the
trial
transcript
shows
that
white
vs.
maryland
was
not
violated
and
therefore,
i
lose
on
that
point.
i
have
additional
points
for
the
reason
of
this
habeas
corpus
petition
including
incompetency
of
counsel
and
including
also,
i
submit,
your
honor,
this,
whether
or
not
in
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
petitioner
contends
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
true.
however,
i
think
the
court
has
indicated
that
whether
the
court
has
made
an
accurate
and
adequate
investigation
of
the
case
may
not
be
completely
shown
by
what
the
pages
of
the
trial
indicate.
the
petitioner
here
has
alleged
specifically
that
counsel
lack
time
and
there
was
a
shift
of
appointed
counsels
shortly
before
the
trial
that
the
counsel
act--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
wouldn't
call
at
that,
your
honor.
it's
incumbent
upon
me
that
test
whether
this
man
had
a
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
see
that
he
had
a
fair
trial
in
habeas
corpus.
the
original
trial
transcript
won't
tell
me
that.
to
find
out
of
the
trial
judge
in
habeas
corpus
wrongfully
admitted
hearsay
whether
he
improperly
cut
off
my
client
from
testifying
on
relevant
matter.
all
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
essential
for
me
to
have
a
habeas
transcript
to
see
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
your
honor.
there's
no
proof
that
he
requested
counsel.
there's
no
provision
for
counsel
in
habeas
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
was
there.
he
was
permitted
to
ask
such
questions
as
he
wanted
of
the
state's
witnesses
and
also
to
make
an
argument.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
have.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
do.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
do,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
i'm
sure
that
he
can't
recollect
the
decisions
made
by
the
trial
court
on
the
admission
of
evidence
or
objections
made
things
of
this
nature.
it
seems
to
me
that
test
whether
he
got
a
fair
hearing
or
fair
trial,
i
need
the
transcript
to
look
at.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
appears
clear
to
me,
your
honor,
that
upon
looking
at
it
that
it
was
used.
as
i
say
11
questions
that
i
found
were
directed
to
admissions
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
some
of
those
were
objected
to
and
overruled
but
--
or
the
objection
was
sustained
but
on
some
points,
the
petitioner
was
required
to
answer.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
original
trial
transcript,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
can
tell
you
it
was
not
there
at
the
habeas
corpus,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
the
petitioner,
being
a
non-lawyer,
apparently
did
a
very
poor
job
permit
me
to
the
very
cord
job
of
putting
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
he
might
be
able
to
do
that.
they
have
rather
liberal
authority
to
order
up
other
record
material
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
they
could.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
now,
the
experience
of
the
states
following
smith
vs.
bennett
and
lane
vs.
brown
has
been
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
position
that
we
here
advocate.
at
least
30
states
give
habeas
corpus
appeals
as
a
matter
of
right
just
as
iowa.
and
of
those
30,
26
gave
a
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
to
the
petitioner
in
the
position
of
the
petitioner
whom
i
represent.
so,
we
think
that
the
experience
of
the
states
is
moving
in
the
very
direction
of
the
position
we
raised
to
this
court.
we
do
not
say
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
is
not
or
that
the
states
are
not
free
to
put
on
limiting
devices
on
perhaps
the
number
of
writs
that
can
be
filed
to
otherwise
police
what
they're
--
the
amount
of
habeas
corpus
applications
made
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is,
that
where
a
screening
device
depends
upon
poverty
as
this
one
does.
this
is
an
improper
screening
device.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honors,
i
will
briefly
addressed
myself
to
a
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
white
have
inquired
into
and
that
is,
“has
the
iowa
supreme
court
ever
afforded
transcripts
in
habeas
corpus?”
if
i
could
respond
with
perhaps
a
brief
quote,
your
honor,
from
the
latest
authority
i
could
find
on
the
point
which
is
hoskins
vs.
bennett
which
they
say
--
here
the
petitioner
also
had
requested
a
transcript
of
public
expenses
in
habeas
corpus.
the
trial
court
said
that
habeas
corpus
is
a
civil
proceeding
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
iowa
law
for
a
transcript
to
be
evidence
in
such
cases
at
public
expense.
this
is
true.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
hoskins
vs.
bennett.
i
just
have
the
iowa
here,
your
honor,
256
iowa,
citing
page
1376.
mr.

1964.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
also,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
walden
vs.
district
court
which
our
supreme
court
ordered
in
this
case,
cites
2
gives
credence
to
this
civil
labeling
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
justice
white
also
asked
the
question,
had
the
iowa
court
ever
been
faced
with
the
potential
substitutes,
the
bystanders
bills
and
so
forth
that
mr.
bennett
here
has
suggested
in
this
case,
we
point
to
the
case
of
weaver
vs.
herrick,
decided
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
1966
in
which
the
question
came
to
the
supreme
court,
what
is
necessary
for
a
meaningful
appeal
to
indigents
in
iowa?
this,
in
connection
with
direct
criminal
causes,
first
appeal,
court
responded
emphatically.
of
course,
the
transcript
is
essential
for
this
kind
of
appeal.
the
reason
they
don't
do
it
in
habeas
corpus
we
submit,
is
because
of
the
civil
labeling.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
would
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
to
order
the
district
court
to
enter
to
prepare
a
transcript
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor,
although
the
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
we've
done
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
that's
legitimate
your
honor.
of
course,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
decision
perhaps
could
be
broader
and
say
that
where
evidentiary
hearings
are
had
as
in
this
case,
where
the
appellate
court
is
being
asked
to
review
evidentiary
matters,
obviously
without
a
transcript
of
the
petitioner
who
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
you
have
the
problem
arising
quite
analogously
in
griffin
vs.
illinois.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
my
response
would
be
on
that,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
case,
of
course,
our
petitioner
is
without
counsel
denied
that
by
the
state.
he
would
be
all
prepared
to
drudge
up
from
memory.
what
evidence
was
presented
at
the
trial
of
the
case
even
to
present
to
bystanders
to
affirm
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right
and
he
will
still
be.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
they
are.
they
certainly
could
promulgate
a
supreme
court
rule
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
they're
broad
enough
to
do
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
that
is
also
denied
him
under
the
civil
proceeding
rationale.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
civil
proceeding
rationale
is
--
well,
perhaps
i
should
pause
on
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
perhaps
i
should
pause
on
that.
i
would
feel
that
in
the
context
that
were
talking
about
here,
equal
protection
–
that
would
dictate
the
appointment
of
counsel
ultimately
but
–
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
on
counsel?
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
no,
that's
my
response.
[voice
overlap]
that
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i've
enjoyed
my
service
so
far,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
too
griever
prospect.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
for
sure.
