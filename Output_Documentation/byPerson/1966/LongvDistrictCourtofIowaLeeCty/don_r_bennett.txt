mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
go
to
the
point
that
has
been
commented
upon
by
several
justices
so
i
don't
lose
it.
did
mr.
carlson
was
referring
to
the
district
court's
order
denying
long's
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
insofar
as
that
court
found
that
long
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
i
believe
i
am
free
in
reading
this
language
to
have
made
the
concession
on
behalf
of
the
state
because
i
think
the
language
of
the
court's
order
had
self
indicates
that
counsel
wasn't
there.
and
if
i
could
take
the
liberty
on
page
30
of
the
record
and
without
going
into
the
whole
hearing
down
in
the
last
paragraph,
about
middle
way
through,
“court
further
finds
that
as
to
objection
no.
2
that
he
was
denied
counsel
at
the
time
of
preliminary
hearing,
the
county
attorney
(inaudible)
contacted
the
attorney
for
the
then
defendant,
patrick
lied,
and
said
attorney
advised
that
he
would
not
be
present
and
informed
the
county
attorney
that
he
would
waive
the
defendant
to
the
grand
jury”.
so,
the
court's
own
finding
shows
that
an
attorney
was
not
physically
present
in
the
courtroom;
that
the
county
attorney
had
called
the
attorney
and
he
said,
“yes,
i'll
represent
the
man
but
i
waive
him
to
the
grand
jury”.
and
of
course,
after
they
got
into
the
room
where
the
justice
of
peace
was
at,
the
justice
of
peace
accepted
“plea
of
guilty”.
and
the
justice
of
peace
in
the
state
of
iowa
has
no
jurisdiction
to
accept
a
guilty
plea
in
a
felony
case;
this
is
why
we
have
white
vs.
maryland
comparable
situation.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
what
the
trial
court
is
saying
is
that
he
was
at
all
times
represented
in
the
sense
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
had
made
the
same
statement
in
its
opinion
affirming
the
conviction
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
physically
in
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
as
the
court's
opinion
indicates,
at
the
very
moment,
the
man
was
taken
there
for
a
preliminary
hearing,
that
was
when
the
lawyer
was
contacted.
the
county
attorney
got
in
touch
with
this
lawyer
on
the
telephone.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
this
is
confusing
to
you
and
i
mean
i
can't
of
course
that's
in
the
record.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
--
they
brought
the
man
in
for
a
preliminary
hearing,
at
which
time
a
county
attorney
went
out
and
called
patrick
lied,
who
was
a
local
attorney
in
oskaloosa,
iowa
where
this
took
place.
mr.
lied
said,
“yes,
i'll
represent
the
man
but
i
waive
him
over
the
grand
jury”.
so
i
just
want
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
attorney
general
for
whatever
that
is
were,
has
ruled
subsequent
to
white
vs.
maryland,
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
at
a
preliminary
hearing
at
least
to
this
extent.
but
the
counsel
was
not
appointed.
and
if
the
man,
“enters
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
then
that
plea
of
guilty
or
admission
of--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
by
virtue
of
this
court
proceeding.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
he
has
ruled
that
counsel
ought
to
be
appointed
at
preliminary
hearing
because
of
white
vs.
maryland.
perhaps,
i
don't
fully
appreciate
your
question
but
to
me
white
vs.
maryland
becomes
significant
only
at
a
subsequent
period
of
time
when
they
tried
to
introduce
any
damaging
statements
made
after
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
cannot
--
the
states
unequivocally
as
mr.
carlson
had
stated
that
the
record
shows
that.
now
actually,
what
happened,
i
got
the
trial
record
with
me
--
it
was
found
by
him
here
and
what
does
this
record
would
show?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
you
do
not
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
do
not
request
--
this
record
was
not
directed
up
to
the
court
and
at
the
late
stage,
we
get
attempt
to
get
this
record
before
the
court
was
unsuccessful.
you're
certainly
entitled
or
you
certainly
may
have
my
copy
if
you
want
me
to
leave
it
with
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i'd
be
very
happy
for
you,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now
to
briefly
answer
your
question.
what
the
record
shows
is
an
attempt
by
the
county
attorney,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
in
cross
examining
lawrence
long
when
he
took
the
stand
to
get
lawrence
long
to
admit
that
he
made
some
admissions
before
the
justice
of
peace.
but
it's
neither
black
nor
white.
it's
not
clear
as
to
whether
white
vs.
maryland
has
been
violated
in
my
estimation.
now
here's
what
we
are
here
talking
about
this
morning.
it's
a
28-paged
transcript
that
recorded
the
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
i'm
not
saying
this
case
is
moot
because
i
ordered
this
transcript
after
certiorari
was
granted
and
it
has
not
been
made
available
to
lawrence
long.
obviously,
that's
what
we're
here
talking
about.
now
i've
got
to
admit,
and
i'm
going
to
admit
as
practical
matter,
that
it
isn't
too
practical
to
have
now
in
retrospect
spent
some
$3,000
or
$4,000
probably
to
attempt
to
justify
the
denial
of
this
$25
transcript.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
and
so
numerous
that
i
don't
mean
to
waive
aside
any
cases
since
the
court
is
not
concerned
with
whether
the
state
is
impractical
but
whether
the
state
has
denied
this
individual
particularly
lawrence
long
due
process,
equal
protection
by
not
making
available
to
him
a
free
copy,
a
copy
without
cause
in
this
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
is
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
physically
what
happened
was,
after
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
denied
--
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
it
was
denied
--
then,
lawrence
long
per
se
filed
at
that
time
with
a
proper
notice
of
appeal
with
the
iowa
supreme
court.
so
that
now
that
gave
the
iowa
court
jurisdiction
to
review
the
denial
of
this
petition.
simultaneously
with
filing
this
notice,
the
petitioner
made
an
application
to
the
trial
court
that
denied
the
petition.
he
said,
“i
want
to
be
a
free
hearing
transcript”
and
incidentally,
“i
want
counsel
to
assist
me
in
connection
with
the
appeal”.
and
that's
an
issue
which
is
in
the
petition
but
what
this
court
denied,
unaccepted.
alright,
the
trial
court
said,
“that
particularly
your
application
is
denied
because
there
is
no
provision
of
law”
and
i'm
required
to
furnish
him
of
the
pre-trial
transcript.
alright,
so
then
lawrence
long
says
well,
“you
can't
do
that
because
of
this
line
of
decisions,
griffin
vs.
illinois
on
down
true”.
he
filed
then
a
petition
or
an
application
for
certiorari
in
the
iowa
supreme
court.
certiorari
in
the
iowa
supreme
court
lies
to
correct
illegal
action
on
behalf
of
the
lower
tribunal.
so
he
is
saying
that
–-
lawrence
long
was
saying
the
lower
tribunal
acted
illegally,
unconstitutionally.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
now
in
footnote
5
of
our
brief,
i
pointed
this
out
because
i
think
conceptually
it's
very
important
that
the
court
knows/understands
that
on
appeal
that
the
appeal
still
is
pending.
now
we
could
have
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
when
long
didn't
file
his
record,
he
had
a
certain
length
of
time
within
which
to
file
this
record
--
we
could
have
moved
to
dismiss
his
appeal
but
obviously,
we're
not
going
to
do
that
whenever
he
has
made
application
to
this
court
for
relief
contending
the
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
so,
he
still
has
an
appeal
there.
now,
if
he
is
or
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
transcript,
he
still
has
the
iowa
supreme
court
to
turn
to,
to
review
the
denial
of
this
habeas
corpus
petitioner.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
pretty
universal
that
the
trial
courts
will
not
give
a
free
copy
of
the
habeas
hearing
transcript.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
nothing
to
keep.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
yes.
in
denying
this
petitioner,
in
denying
this
application
for
certiorari,
the
iowa
supreme
court
cited
walden
vs.
district
court
which
mr.
carlson
has
referred
to.
now,
walden
vs.
district
court
was
concerned
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
an
indigent
in
a
habeas
action.
and
mr.
carlson
rightly
points
out
that
the
iowa
court
talks
in
terms
of
the
civil
liability
but
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear,
i
mean
do
you
recall
that
when
this
court
decided
smith
vs.
bennett,
it
indicated
that
it
wasn't
going
to
be
quibble
with
this
nomenclature
whether
it
would
be
so
a
criminal
is
right
or
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
it
does
not
say
that.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
do
not
know
--
excuse
me.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
do
not
know
that
that
is
entirely
accurate
because
the
petition
for
certiorari,
petition
as
it
was
filed
with
the
iowa
supreme
court
as
well
as
the
application
to
the
trial
court
simply
as
a
conclusary
allegation
that
he
needs
the
transcript.
there
was
nothing
beyond
it
that
we
would
have
to
assume
but
perhaps,
had
there
been
a
stronger
showing
on
behalf
of
the
inmate
that
he
really
needed
the
transcript,
that
he
couldn't
get
the
record
up
to
the
court
in
any
other
way,
may
be
the
court
would
have
granted
the
certiorari.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
not
directly
in
point,
your
honor.
i
can
refer
you
to
all
of
the
cases
in
volume
256
of
the
iowa
reports,
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
matters.
i
went
back
and
checked
them.
i
put
some
of
the
orders
in
appendix
to
this
brief.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
petitioner
proceeded
per
se
and
everyone
of
the
supreme
court
relaxed
the
rule
regarding
the
record,
regarding
the
briefs
in
some
respects
or
the
other.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
think
to
say
that
it
is
civil
is
irrelevant
to
the
real
issue
here,
now
we
can
take
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
believe
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
cannot
speak
for
the
supreme
court
and
unfortunately
i
have
and
on
pretty
tenuous
ground
even
speak
for
the
attorney
general
because
of
last
night.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i'm
sorry,
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
no,
they're
not.
but
part
of
our
argument
here
is
that
the
appeal
is
still
pending
and
the
rules
in
the
civil
procedure
which
are
applicable
to
habeas
appeals
are
flexible
enough
that
this
man
may
very
well
be
and
we
will
get
an
adequate
record
before
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
short
of
having
the
hearing
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
mean
that
he
not
able?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
are
they
foreclosed
from
doing
it?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
trial
court
is
for
--
the
trial
court
has
the
power
to
do
it.
trial
court
says
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right,
there
is
no
rule
of
law
in
the
state
of
iowa
requiring
furnishing
an
indigent
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
would
have
to
answer
i
think,
yes
that
he
could
file
a
further
application,
trying
to
set
forth
why
he
cannot
comply
or
work
with
the
rules
of
the
civil
procedure
which
would
allow
him
to
get
up
a
record
despite
the
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
let's
go
to
the
rules,
mr.
justice
clark.
rule
340
which
is
the
main
rule
and
the
one
that's
discussed
on
the
brief,
provides
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
shortly
or
promptly
--
the
appeal
has
been
noted.
the
appellant
is
to
file
a
duplicate
typewritten
manuscript
of
so
much
of
the
record
as
is
believed
to
be
relevant
to
the
appeal
and
at
the
same
time
he
showed
file
of
the
trial
transcript;
in
this
case,
this
document.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
within
the
20
days
the
other
party
can
amend
the
record,
make
corrections
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
then
after
the
time
for
amendment
is
up,
then
upon
three
days
written
notice,
the
proposed
abstract,
with
whatever
amendments
or
corrections
there
might
be,
can
be
submitted
to
trial
court
who
heard
the
case.
and
then,
the
language
of
the
rule
as
in
this,
by
the
way,
has
statutory
authority.
it's
not
just
a
rule.
it
is
that
the
trial
court
shall
settle
the
record
--
to
the
end
of
the
abstract
correctly
shows
the
evidence
and
proceedings
at
the
trial
--
and
i
assume
along
with
me
just
for
a
moment
that
the
hearing
transcript
may
not
be
filed
as
rule
340
said
and
as
i
told
you.
well
then,
you
have
got
a
situation
which
i
think
was
contemplated
by
the
majority
in
graper
v.
washington,
a
situation
where
if
this
man,
lawrence
long,
has
the
ability
to
remember
the
evidence
at
the
hearing,
he
can
prepare
a
narrative
statement.
now
remember
this
man,
at
least
we've
got
to
assume
if
he
has
prepared
applications
and
petitions
and
etcetera
and
etcetera.
alright,
i
don't
think
he
can't
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
he
would
have
to
have
been
because
a
hearing
was
held
at
which
he
was
to
give
his
side.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
so
assuming
that
the
transcript
may
not
be
filed,
at
least,
we
have
a
situation
where
if
he
is
capable,
he
could
file
a
narrative
statement
of
what
he
thinks
the
evidence
shows.
now,
at
the
other
side,
in
this
case
the
county
attorney
doesn't
agree
that
this
was
a
way
the
evidence
was
shown.
well
then,
he's
got
the
burden
to
comment,
amend
and
correct.
now
what
i
think
as
even
more
important
is,
then
when
you
got
to
get
this
thing
before
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
is
enjoined
to
settle
any
differences
in
that
proposed
abstract.
to
the
end
of
the
abstract
correctly
shows
the
evidence
in
proceedings
at
the
trial.
now
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
whether
it
is
in
the
record?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
we
have
in
effect
conceived
that
perhaps
the
whole
court,
if
not
the
whole
then
a
substantial
majority
of
this
court
is
committed
to
the
proposition
that
if
an
indigent
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding
needs
a
transcript
to
get
adequate
and
effective
appellate
review,
he
is
constitutionally
entitled.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
no.
1
we
are
taking
a
position
that
he
has
not
shown
that
he
needs
the
transcript
and
no.
2,
that
there
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
any
place.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
his
petitioner
for
certiorari,
he
could
have
attempted
to
have
made
a
showing
beyond
just
simply
a
conclusary
allegation
that
he
needs
the
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
to
the
iowa
supreme
court,
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
we're
not
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
have
no
intention
of
turning
that
document
over
to
him.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
in
effect
that's
the
issue
but
i
want
to
take
a
step
further.
i
was
developing
this
point.
so
we
think
that
at
least
it
is
arguable
that
he
could
have
got
the
record
made
up.
alright
now,
the
petitioner
said,
“well,
isn't
that
foolish,
mr.
bennett?”
the
very
thing
which
i
can't
get,
they
going
to
force
me
to
file
in
order
to
get
this
thing
started.
well,
i
suggest
to
you
that's
just
not
so
because
iowa
rule
of
civil
procedure
371,
which
his
cited
in
the
brief,
plainly
indicates
that
the
court,
the
iowa
court
has
go
the
power
to
change
or
modify
rule
340
insofar
as
the
record
making
procedures
are
concerned
and
i
don't
think
the
iowa
court
is
going
to
say
to
him,
“we
recognize
you
an
indigent.
we
recognize
you've
got
the
right
to
appeal
but
were
going
to
force
you
to
file
the
very
thing
you
can't
get
because
you
can't
buy
it
to
get
up
here
to
us.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
am
asking
you
to
hold
that
there
has
not
been
a
sufficient
showing
that
this
man
has
been
deprived
of
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
rather
say,
it's
not
i
who
doesn't
want
to
give
it
to
him.
[voice
overlap]
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
now
no.
2
i
think
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
don't
think
the
draper
versus
washington
was
decided
couple
of
years
ago
and
of
course,
you
have
dissented
in
that
opinion
but
you
say
that
in
davis
versus
california
(inaudible)
griffin
versus
illinois.
and
draper
clearly
says
that
an
alternative
--
i'm
reading
from
page
905
i
guess
of
lawyer's
edition
--
no,
372
us
487,
“that
alternate
matters
of
reporting
trial
proceedings
are
permissible.
if
they
place
before
the
appellate
court
an
equivalent
report
of
the
events
at
trial
for
which
the
appellee's
contentions
arise.
yes,
and
the
court
says
--
a
statement
of
facts
agreed
to
by
both
sides.
we
have
a
rule-making
procedure
which
allows
that
and
which
is
very
briefly
discussed
in
the
brief.
the
statement
of
facts
agreed
to
by
both
sides,
a
full
narrative
statement
based
perhaps
on
the
trial
judge's
minutes
taken
before
trial
or
on
the
court
reporters
untranscribed
notes.
now
i
have
suggested
that
this
need
not
be
filed
and
that
the
trial
court
is
enjoined
to
settle
that
record.
to
the
end
of
that
show,
the
evidence
is
correct.
now,
the
trial
court
has
jurisdiction
over
and
control
of
his
court
reporter
and
there's
nothing
that
keep
him
from
calling
that
book
reporter
in
the
–
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
mean
at
the
habeas?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
mean
in
trying
to
get
up
a
record
from
the
habeas
hearing
itself?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
think
whether
the
objections
were
made
or
not,
whether
it
was
sustained
or
not,
is
not
terribly
important
because
what
his
interest
should
be
is
getting
the
evidence
set
out
to
show
how
and
he
has
been
unlawfully
confined.
now,
the
petitioner
has
stated
in
argument
and
he
states
in
his
brief
that
--
and
in
the
record
because
may
be
the
habeas
trial
court
made
some
error
--
overruled
an
objection
or
didn't
sustain
an
objection
something
like
this.
i
don't
think
that's
important.
i
don't
think
that
he
is
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
alright,
i
think
this
brings
to
the
third
point.
i
just
want
to
spend
at
least
a
couple
of
seconds
on
and
that's
his
trial
record
right
here.
now,
in
draper
vs.
washington,
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear,
the
majority
of
the
court,
that
is
not
necessary
to
furnish
a
transcript
to
an
indigent
if
the
transcript
is
not
germane
to
the
contentions
which
were
made.
draper
filed
a
motion
setting
forth
his
contentions
and
why
he
needed
the
transcript.
alright,
here,
lawrence
long
filed
a
petition
and
he
set
forth
certain
contentions.
in
fact,
he
set
forth
specifically
filed.
one
is
the
white
vs.
maryland
contention.
alright,
at
that
plea,
a
guilty
was
entered
at
the
trial,
this
is
the
best
source.
this
will
tell
you
not
anything
that
happened
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
you
look
to
the
original
trial
transcript
to
find
out
whether
white
vs.
maryland
had
been
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
what's
raised
--
you
can
see
that
from
the
trial
court's
judgment
denying
the
petitioner
for
habeas
corpus.
he
sets
the
five
areas
out
so
we
know
it's
been
raised
there.
but
the
most
relevant
source
to
(inaudible)
and
secondly,
he
says
he
had
incompetent
counsel
and
that
he
checked
the
petition,
he
says
the
comments
the
petitioner's
court-appointed
attorney
is
challenged
in
the
question
of
competence
here
goes
only
to
the
said
attorney's
conduct
and
action
and
representation
of
the
petitioner
in
his
criminal
trial.
where
else
would
you
want
to
--
what
more
relevant
source
would
you
have
to
see
how
his
attorney
behaved
than
right
here
in
the
trial
transcript?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
yes,
but
then
if
he
was
not
physically
present
and
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
at
this
trial
then,
i
think
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
relief
under
white
vs.
maryland.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well
i
don't
[voice
overlap]
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
i
don't
concede
that
white
vs.
maryland
has
been
violated.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
point
is,
i
think
this
is
the
place
to
find
out.
now
as
far
as
his
third
contention
is,
he
says
that
no
brief
on
the
merits
was
filed
with
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
he
is
thereby
contending
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
his
appeal.
well,
you
don't
mean
copy
that
trial
transcript
where
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
concerned
to
find
out
what
it's
own
record
show
and
in
fact,
they
will
show
on
the
appendix
of
our
brief
and--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
to
answer
your
question
and
i
am
a
little
bit
(inaudible)
with
it
because
it
seemed
not
to
be
phrased
quite
so
much
as
a
question
but
as
an
observation.
would
you
–
mr.
don
r.
bennett
if
i
might
respond
the
observation,
we
may
very
well
be
wrong,
of
course,
in
the
position
we've
taken
in
the
brief
and
if
we
are
wrong,
why
don't
this
court
rule,
issue
a
decision
which
will
take
care
of
the
problem
because
it
will
be
a
constitutional
decision
and
wallace
probably
will
be
no
comfort.
i
will
assure
you
this
that
if
the
court
holds
for
the
state,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
have
already
ordered
the
transcript,
and
in
fact
two
copies.
i
will
certainly
see
that
this
doesn't
happen.
but
i'm
not
releasing
that
transcript
until
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
happen
to
share
your
view,
your
honor,
i
would
just
assure
not
to
see
this
waste
also.
but
i'm
precipitated
in
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
is
the
law
of
iowa
in
so
far
as
the
court
is
right
in
saying
that
–
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
not
to
my
knowledge,
they
have
not.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
whether
they
would
agree
to
what
i
have
argued
to
the
court
today?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
would
have
to
assume
they
would
because
they
summarily
denied
the
application
for
certiorari
for
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
think
that
in
ruling
they
necessarily
have
stated
that.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
there
is
no
such
ruling.
the
iowa
supreme
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
they're
talking
not
the
transcript
but
about
an
abstract
of
record
which
would
ordinarily
be
made
up
from
the
hearing
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
this
is
possible
except
in
some
of
those
cases.
there
was
not
a
hearing
to
begin
with.
these
were
habeas
corpus
actions
that
were
resolved
on
the
pleadings
themselves
so
it
wasn't
necessary
to
go
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
and
those,
of
course,
are
available
to
lawrence
long.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
record
would
show.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
go
to
the
point
that
has
been
commented
upon
by
several
justices
so
i
don't
lose
it.
did
mr.
carlson
was
referring
to
the
district
court's
order
denying
long's
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
insofar
as
that
court
found
that
long
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
i
believe
i
am
free
in
reading
this
language
to
have
made
the
concession
on
behalf
of
the
state
because
i
think
the
language
of
the
court's
order
had
self
indicates
that
counsel
wasn't
there.
and
if
i
could
take
the
liberty
on
page
30
of
the
record
and
without
going
into
the
whole
hearing
down
in
the
last
paragraph,
about
middle
way
through,
“court
further
finds
that
as
to
objection
no.
2
that
he
was
denied
counsel
at
the
time
of
preliminary
hearing,
the
county
attorney
(inaudible)
contacted
the
attorney
for
the
then
defendant,
patrick
lied,
and
said
attorney
advised
that
he
would
not
be
present
and
informed
the
county
attorney
that
he
would
waive
the
defendant
to
the
grand
jury”.
so,
the
court's
own
finding
shows
that
an
attorney
was
not
physically
present
in
the
courtroom;
that
the
county
attorney
had
called
the
attorney
and
he
said,
“yes,
i'll
represent
the
man
but
i
waive
him
to
the
grand
jury”.
and
of
course,
after
they
got
into
the
room
where
the
justice
of
peace
was
at,
the
justice
of
peace
accepted
“plea
of
guilty”.
and
the
justice
of
peace
in
the
state
of
iowa
has
no
jurisdiction
to
accept
a
guilty
plea
in
a
felony
case;
this
is
why
we
have
white
vs.
maryland
comparable
situation.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
what
the
trial
court
is
saying
is
that
he
was
at
all
times
represented
in
the
sense
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
had
made
the
same
statement
in
its
opinion
affirming
the
conviction
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
physically
in
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
as
the
court's
opinion
indicates,
at
the
very
moment,
the
man
was
taken
there
for
a
preliminary
hearing,
that
was
when
the
lawyer
was
contacted.
the
county
attorney
got
in
touch
with
this
lawyer
on
the
telephone.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
this
is
confusing
to
you
and
i
mean
i
can't
of
course
that's
in
the
record.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
--
they
brought
the
man
in
for
a
preliminary
hearing,
at
which
time
a
county
attorney
went
out
and
called
patrick
lied,
who
was
a
local
attorney
in
oskaloosa,
iowa
where
this
took
place.
mr.
lied
said,
“yes,
i'll
represent
the
man
but
i
waive
him
over
the
grand
jury”.
so
i
just
want
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
attorney
general
for
whatever
that
is
were,
has
ruled
subsequent
to
white
vs.
maryland,
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
at
a
preliminary
hearing
at
least
to
this
extent.
but
the
counsel
was
not
appointed.
and
if
the
man,
“enters
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
then
that
plea
of
guilty
or
admission
of--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
by
virtue
of
this
court
proceeding.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
he
has
ruled
that
counsel
ought
to
be
appointed
at
preliminary
hearing
because
of
white
vs.
maryland.
perhaps,
i
don't
fully
appreciate
your
question
but
to
me
white
vs.
maryland
becomes
significant
only
at
a
subsequent
period
of
time
when
they
tried
to
introduce
any
damaging
statements
made
after
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
cannot
--
the
states
unequivocally
as
mr.
carlson
had
stated
that
the
record
shows
that.
now
actually,
what
happened,
i
got
the
trial
record
with
me
--
it
was
found
by
him
here
and
what
does
this
record
would
show?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
you
do
not
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
do
not
request
--
this
record
was
not
directed
up
to
the
court
and
at
the
late
stage,
we
get
attempt
to
get
this
record
before
the
court
was
unsuccessful.
you're
certainly
entitled
or
you
certainly
may
have
my
copy
if
you
want
me
to
leave
it
with
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i'd
be
very
happy
for
you,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now
to
briefly
answer
your
question.
what
the
record
shows
is
an
attempt
by
the
county
attorney,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
in
cross
examining
lawrence
long
when
he
took
the
stand
to
get
lawrence
long
to
admit
that
he
made
some
admissions
before
the
justice
of
peace.
but
it's
neither
black
nor
white.
it's
not
clear
as
to
whether
white
vs.
maryland
has
been
violated
in
my
estimation.
now
here's
what
we
are
here
talking
about
this
morning.
it's
a
28-paged
transcript
that
recorded
the
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
i'm
not
saying
this
case
is
moot
because
i
ordered
this
transcript
after
certiorari
was
granted
and
it
has
not
been
made
available
to
lawrence
long.
obviously,
that's
what
we're
here
talking
about.
now
i've
got
to
admit,
and
i'm
going
to
admit
as
practical
matter,
that
it
isn't
too
practical
to
have
now
in
retrospect
spent
some
$3,000
or
$4,000
probably
to
attempt
to
justify
the
denial
of
this
$25
transcript.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
and
so
numerous
that
i
don't
mean
to
waive
aside
any
cases
since
the
court
is
not
concerned
with
whether
the
state
is
impractical
but
whether
the
state
has
denied
this
individual
particularly
lawrence
long
due
process,
equal
protection
by
not
making
available
to
him
a
free
copy,
a
copy
without
cause
in
this
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
is
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
physically
what
happened
was,
after
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
denied
--
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
it
was
denied
--
then,
lawrence
long
per
se
filed
at
that
time
with
a
proper
notice
of
appeal
with
the
iowa
supreme
court.
so
that
now
that
gave
the
iowa
court
jurisdiction
to
review
the
denial
of
this
petition.
simultaneously
with
filing
this
notice,
the
petitioner
made
an
application
to
the
trial
court
that
denied
the
petition.
he
said,
“i
want
to
be
a
free
hearing
transcript”
and
incidentally,
“i
want
counsel
to
assist
me
in
connection
with
the
appeal”.
and
that's
an
issue
which
is
in
the
petition
but
what
this
court
denied,
unaccepted.
alright,
the
trial
court
said,
“that
particularly
your
application
is
denied
because
there
is
no
provision
of
law”
and
i'm
required
to
furnish
him
of
the
pre-trial
transcript.
alright,
so
then
lawrence
long
says
well,
“you
can't
do
that
because
of
this
line
of
decisions,
griffin
vs.
illinois
on
down
true”.
he
filed
then
a
petition
or
an
application
for
certiorari
in
the
iowa
supreme
court.
certiorari
in
the
iowa
supreme
court
lies
to
correct
illegal
action
on
behalf
of
the
lower
tribunal.
so
he
is
saying
that
–-
lawrence
long
was
saying
the
lower
tribunal
acted
illegally,
unconstitutionally.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
now
in
footnote
5
of
our
brief,
i
pointed
this
out
because
i
think
conceptually
it's
very
important
that
the
court
knows/understands
that
on
appeal
that
the
appeal
still
is
pending.
now
we
could
have
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
when
long
didn't
file
his
record,
he
had
a
certain
length
of
time
within
which
to
file
this
record
--
we
could
have
moved
to
dismiss
his
appeal
but
obviously,
we're
not
going
to
do
that
whenever
he
has
made
application
to
this
court
for
relief
contending
the
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
so,
he
still
has
an
appeal
there.
now,
if
he
is
or
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
transcript,
he
still
has
the
iowa
supreme
court
to
turn
to,
to
review
the
denial
of
this
habeas
corpus
petitioner.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
pretty
universal
that
the
trial
courts
will
not
give
a
free
copy
of
the
habeas
hearing
transcript.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
nothing
to
keep.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
yes.
in
denying
this
petitioner,
in
denying
this
application
for
certiorari,
the
iowa
supreme
court
cited
walden
vs.
district
court
which
mr.
carlson
has
referred
to.
now,
walden
vs.
district
court
was
concerned
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
an
indigent
in
a
habeas
action.
and
mr.
carlson
rightly
points
out
that
the
iowa
court
talks
in
terms
of
the
civil
liability
but
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear,
i
mean
do
you
recall
that
when
this
court
decided
smith
vs.
bennett,
it
indicated
that
it
wasn't
going
to
be
quibble
with
this
nomenclature
whether
it
would
be
so
a
criminal
is
right
or
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
it
does
not
say
that.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
do
not
know
--
excuse
me.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
do
not
know
that
that
is
entirely
accurate
because
the
petition
for
certiorari,
petition
as
it
was
filed
with
the
iowa
supreme
court
as
well
as
the
application
to
the
trial
court
simply
as
a
conclusary
allegation
that
he
needs
the
transcript.
there
was
nothing
beyond
it
that
we
would
have
to
assume
but
perhaps,
had
there
been
a
stronger
showing
on
behalf
of
the
inmate
that
he
really
needed
the
transcript,
that
he
couldn't
get
the
record
up
to
the
court
in
any
other
way,
may
be
the
court
would
have
granted
the
certiorari.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
not
directly
in
point,
your
honor.
i
can
refer
you
to
all
of
the
cases
in
volume
256
of
the
iowa
reports,
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
matters.
i
went
back
and
checked
them.
i
put
some
of
the
orders
in
appendix
to
this
brief.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
petitioner
proceeded
per
se
and
everyone
of
the
supreme
court
relaxed
the
rule
regarding
the
record,
regarding
the
briefs
in
some
respects
or
the
other.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
think
to
say
that
it
is
civil
is
irrelevant
to
the
real
issue
here,
now
we
can
take
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
believe
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
cannot
speak
for
the
supreme
court
and
unfortunately
i
have
and
on
pretty
tenuous
ground
even
speak
for
the
attorney
general
because
of
last
night.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i'm
sorry,
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
no,
they're
not.
but
part
of
our
argument
here
is
that
the
appeal
is
still
pending
and
the
rules
in
the
civil
procedure
which
are
applicable
to
habeas
appeals
are
flexible
enough
that
this
man
may
very
well
be
and
we
will
get
an
adequate
record
before
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
short
of
having
the
hearing
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
mean
that
he
not
able?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
are
they
foreclosed
from
doing
it?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
trial
court
is
for
--
the
trial
court
has
the
power
to
do
it.
trial
court
says
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right,
there
is
no
rule
of
law
in
the
state
of
iowa
requiring
furnishing
an
indigent
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
would
have
to
answer
i
think,
yes
that
he
could
file
a
further
application,
trying
to
set
forth
why
he
cannot
comply
or
work
with
the
rules
of
the
civil
procedure
which
would
allow
him
to
get
up
a
record
despite
the
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
let's
go
to
the
rules,
mr.
justice
clark.
rule
340
which
is
the
main
rule
and
the
one
that's
discussed
on
the
brief,
provides
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
shortly
or
promptly
--
the
appeal
has
been
noted.
the
appellant
is
to
file
a
duplicate
typewritten
manuscript
of
so
much
of
the
record
as
is
believed
to
be
relevant
to
the
appeal
and
at
the
same
time
he
showed
file
of
the
trial
transcript;
in
this
case,
this
document.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
within
the
20
days
the
other
party
can
amend
the
record,
make
corrections
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
then
after
the
time
for
amendment
is
up,
then
upon
three
days
written
notice,
the
proposed
abstract,
with
whatever
amendments
or
corrections
there
might
be,
can
be
submitted
to
trial
court
who
heard
the
case.
and
then,
the
language
of
the
rule
as
in
this,
by
the
way,
has
statutory
authority.
it's
not
just
a
rule.
it
is
that
the
trial
court
shall
settle
the
record
--
to
the
end
of
the
abstract
correctly
shows
the
evidence
and
proceedings
at
the
trial
--
and
i
assume
along
with
me
just
for
a
moment
that
the
hearing
transcript
may
not
be
filed
as
rule
340
said
and
as
i
told
you.
well
then,
you
have
got
a
situation
which
i
think
was
contemplated
by
the
majority
in
graper
v.
washington,
a
situation
where
if
this
man,
lawrence
long,
has
the
ability
to
remember
the
evidence
at
the
hearing,
he
can
prepare
a
narrative
statement.
now
remember
this
man,
at
least
we've
got
to
assume
if
he
has
prepared
applications
and
petitions
and
etcetera
and
etcetera.
alright,
i
don't
think
he
can't
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
he
would
have
to
have
been
because
a
hearing
was
held
at
which
he
was
to
give
his
side.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
so
assuming
that
the
transcript
may
not
be
filed,
at
least,
we
have
a
situation
where
if
he
is
capable,
he
could
file
a
narrative
statement
of
what
he
thinks
the
evidence
shows.
now,
at
the
other
side,
in
this
case
the
county
attorney
doesn't
agree
that
this
was
a
way
the
evidence
was
shown.
well
then,
he's
got
the
burden
to
comment,
amend
and
correct.
now
what
i
think
as
even
more
important
is,
then
when
you
got
to
get
this
thing
before
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
is
enjoined
to
settle
any
differences
in
that
proposed
abstract.
to
the
end
of
the
abstract
correctly
shows
the
evidence
in
proceedings
at
the
trial.
now
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
whether
it
is
in
the
record?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
we
have
in
effect
conceived
that
perhaps
the
whole
court,
if
not
the
whole
then
a
substantial
majority
of
this
court
is
committed
to
the
proposition
that
if
an
indigent
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding
needs
a
transcript
to
get
adequate
and
effective
appellate
review,
he
is
constitutionally
entitled.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
no.
1
we
are
taking
a
position
that
he
has
not
shown
that
he
needs
the
transcript
and
no.
2,
that
there
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
any
place.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
his
petitioner
for
certiorari,
he
could
have
attempted
to
have
made
a
showing
beyond
just
simply
a
conclusary
allegation
that
he
needs
the
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
to
the
iowa
supreme
court,
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
we're
not
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
have
no
intention
of
turning
that
document
over
to
him.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
in
effect
that's
the
issue
but
i
want
to
take
a
step
further.
i
was
developing
this
point.
so
we
think
that
at
least
it
is
arguable
that
he
could
have
got
the
record
made
up.
alright
now,
the
petitioner
said,
“well,
isn't
that
foolish,
mr.
bennett?”
the
very
thing
which
i
can't
get,
they
going
to
force
me
to
file
in
order
to
get
this
thing
started.
well,
i
suggest
to
you
that's
just
not
so
because
iowa
rule
of
civil
procedure
371,
which
his
cited
in
the
brief,
plainly
indicates
that
the
court,
the
iowa
court
has
go
the
power
to
change
or
modify
rule
340
insofar
as
the
record
making
procedures
are
concerned
and
i
don't
think
the
iowa
court
is
going
to
say
to
him,
“we
recognize
you
an
indigent.
we
recognize
you've
got
the
right
to
appeal
but
were
going
to
force
you
to
file
the
very
thing
you
can't
get
because
you
can't
buy
it
to
get
up
here
to
us.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
am
asking
you
to
hold
that
there
has
not
been
a
sufficient
showing
that
this
man
has
been
deprived
of
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
rather
say,
it's
not
i
who
doesn't
want
to
give
it
to
him.
[voice
overlap]
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
now
no.
2
i
think
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
don't
think
the
draper
versus
washington
was
decided
couple
of
years
ago
and
of
course,
you
have
dissented
in
that
opinion
but
you
say
that
in
davis
versus
california
(inaudible)
griffin
versus
illinois.
and
draper
clearly
says
that
an
alternative
--
i'm
reading
from
page
905
i
guess
of
lawyer's
edition
--
no,
372
us
487,
“that
alternate
matters
of
reporting
trial
proceedings
are
permissible.
if
they
place
before
the
appellate
court
an
equivalent
report
of
the
events
at
trial
for
which
the
appellee's
contentions
arise.
yes,
and
the
court
says
--
a
statement
of
facts
agreed
to
by
both
sides.
we
have
a
rule-making
procedure
which
allows
that
and
which
is
very
briefly
discussed
in
the
brief.
the
statement
of
facts
agreed
to
by
both
sides,
a
full
narrative
statement
based
perhaps
on
the
trial
judge's
minutes
taken
before
trial
or
on
the
court
reporters
untranscribed
notes.
now
i
have
suggested
that
this
need
not
be
filed
and
that
the
trial
court
is
enjoined
to
settle
that
record.
to
the
end
of
that
show,
the
evidence
is
correct.
now,
the
trial
court
has
jurisdiction
over
and
control
of
his
court
reporter
and
there's
nothing
that
keep
him
from
calling
that
book
reporter
in
the
–
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
mean
at
the
habeas?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
mean
in
trying
to
get
up
a
record
from
the
habeas
hearing
itself?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
think
whether
the
objections
were
made
or
not,
whether
it
was
sustained
or
not,
is
not
terribly
important
because
what
his
interest
should
be
is
getting
the
evidence
set
out
to
show
how
and
he
has
been
unlawfully
confined.
now,
the
petitioner
has
stated
in
argument
and
he
states
in
his
brief
that
--
and
in
the
record
because
may
be
the
habeas
trial
court
made
some
error
--
overruled
an
objection
or
didn't
sustain
an
objection
something
like
this.
i
don't
think
that's
important.
i
don't
think
that
he
is
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
alright,
i
think
this
brings
to
the
third
point.
i
just
want
to
spend
at
least
a
couple
of
seconds
on
and
that's
his
trial
record
right
here.
now,
in
draper
vs.
washington,
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear,
the
majority
of
the
court,
that
is
not
necessary
to
furnish
a
transcript
to
an
indigent
if
the
transcript
is
not
germane
to
the
contentions
which
were
made.
draper
filed
a
motion
setting
forth
his
contentions
and
why
he
needed
the
transcript.
alright,
here,
lawrence
long
filed
a
petition
and
he
set
forth
certain
contentions.
in
fact,
he
set
forth
specifically
filed.
one
is
the
white
vs.
maryland
contention.
alright,
at
that
plea,
a
guilty
was
entered
at
the
trial,
this
is
the
best
source.
this
will
tell
you
not
anything
that
happened
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
you
look
to
the
original
trial
transcript
to
find
out
whether
white
vs.
maryland
had
been
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
what's
raised
--
you
can
see
that
from
the
trial
court's
judgment
denying
the
petitioner
for
habeas
corpus.
he
sets
the
five
areas
out
so
we
know
it's
been
raised
there.
but
the
most
relevant
source
to
(inaudible)
and
secondly,
he
says
he
had
incompetent
counsel
and
that
he
checked
the
petition,
he
says
the
comments
the
petitioner's
court-appointed
attorney
is
challenged
in
the
question
of
competence
here
goes
only
to
the
said
attorney's
conduct
and
action
and
representation
of
the
petitioner
in
his
criminal
trial.
where
else
would
you
want
to
--
what
more
relevant
source
would
you
have
to
see
how
his
attorney
behaved
than
right
here
in
the
trial
transcript?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
yes,
but
then
if
he
was
not
physically
present
and
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
at
this
trial
then,
i
think
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
relief
under
white
vs.
maryland.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well
i
don't
[voice
overlap]
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
i
don't
concede
that
white
vs.
maryland
has
been
violated.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
point
is,
i
think
this
is
the
place
to
find
out.
now
as
far
as
his
third
contention
is,
he
says
that
no
brief
on
the
merits
was
filed
with
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
he
is
thereby
contending
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
his
appeal.
well,
you
don't
mean
copy
that
trial
transcript
where
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
concerned
to
find
out
what
it's
own
record
show
and
in
fact,
they
will
show
on
the
appendix
of
our
brief
and--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
to
answer
your
question
and
i
am
a
little
bit
(inaudible)
with
it
because
it
seemed
not
to
be
phrased
quite
so
much
as
a
question
but
as
an
observation.
would
you
–
mr.
don
r.
bennett
if
i
might
respond
the
observation,
we
may
very
well
be
wrong,
of
course,
in
the
position
we've
taken
in
the
brief
and
if
we
are
wrong,
why
don't
this
court
rule,
issue
a
decision
which
will
take
care
of
the
problem
because
it
will
be
a
constitutional
decision
and
wallace
probably
will
be
no
comfort.
i
will
assure
you
this
that
if
the
court
holds
for
the
state,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
have
already
ordered
the
transcript,
and
in
fact
two
copies.
i
will
certainly
see
that
this
doesn't
happen.
but
i'm
not
releasing
that
transcript
until
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
happen
to
share
your
view,
your
honor,
i
would
just
assure
not
to
see
this
waste
also.
but
i'm
precipitated
in
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
is
the
law
of
iowa
in
so
far
as
the
court
is
right
in
saying
that
–
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
not
to
my
knowledge,
they
have
not.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
whether
they
would
agree
to
what
i
have
argued
to
the
court
today?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
would
have
to
assume
they
would
because
they
summarily
denied
the
application
for
certiorari
for
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
think
that
in
ruling
they
necessarily
have
stated
that.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
there
is
no
such
ruling.
the
iowa
supreme
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
they're
talking
not
the
transcript
but
about
an
abstract
of
record
which
would
ordinarily
be
made
up
from
the
hearing
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
this
is
possible
except
in
some
of
those
cases.
there
was
not
a
hearing
to
begin
with.
these
were
habeas
corpus
actions
that
were
resolved
on
the
pleadings
themselves
so
it
wasn't
necessary
to
go
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
and
those,
of
course,
are
available
to
lawrence
long.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
record
would
show.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
thank
you,
your
honors.
