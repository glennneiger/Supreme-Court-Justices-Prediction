justice
potter
stewart
and
what
were
the
issues
on
the
merits
of
the
habeas
corpus
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
have
been
brought
to
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
counsel
on
this
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
that
he
had
had
counsel
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
something
damaging
had
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
basis
of
what
kind
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
so
that
was
a
factual
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
--
resolved
by
the
habeas
corpus
court.
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
record
before?
justice
potter
stewart
the
transcript
you
say
was
in
the
habeas
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
a
trial
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
record
was
made
at
the
habeas
hearing,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
issue
was
resolved
against
the
petitioner,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
as
an
appeal
from
the
resolution
of
the
issue
against
petitioner
joan
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
you
can't
do
that
effectively
except
as
you
have
copy
of
the
habeas
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
carlson,
what
you
referred
us
to
is
an
admission
by
the
state
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
for
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
told
me
that
you
needed
the
transcript
to
establish
that
fact
because
that
didn't
appear
in
the
recent
trial
record;
it
did
appear
in
the
habeas
record.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here's
a
concession
that
he
was
not
represented
to
that
by
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
didn't
make
this
concession
before
the
supreme
court
of
iowa?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
making
it
only
here?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
doesn't
do
you
any
good
as
the
judgment
against
you
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
--
that
was
in
the
habeas
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
--
the
question
whether
it
was
or
was
not
used
on
the
trial
of
the
court.
is
that
also
resulting
as
an
issue,
as
a
question
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
just
like
taking
your
time,
mr.
carlson.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
just
like
to
make
this
clear.
to
say
now
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
there's
been
an
admission
in
this
court
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong
and
he
did
not
in
fact
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
vacate
and
proceed
to
courtroom.
you
say
that
would
get
you
nowhere
since
there's
still
a
white-maryland
point
whether
or
not
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
was
introduced
to
the
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
no
evidence
was
taken
on
the
question
whether
it
was
introduced
at
the
criminal
trial
that
is
no
evidence
taken
at
the
habeas
hearing,
what
good
it
is
going
to
do
to
you
to
get
the
transcript
to
what
occurred
at
the
habeas
–
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
just
draw
that
instead
of
a
need
to
transcript
not
because
of
any
specific
question,
any
specific
reason
that
i
tell
you,
“i'm
just
plain
entitled
to
the
habeas
corpus
transcript
because
i'm
representing
this
man
on
appeal
and
i
have
to
know
what
went
on
there”.
there
may
be
that
--
that's
what
i
really
want.
you
want
to
engage
in
an
exploratory
examination
not
fishing
expedition.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
wrong
with
your
fishing,
i
would
say
that.
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
have
counsel
at
the
habeas
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
hearing?
was
he
there?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
asked
him
what
went
on
at
the
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
he
has
told
you
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
really,
you
will
find
out
something
more
out
of
the
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
you
found
those
from
looking
at
the
–-
afterwards
looking
at
the
trial
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
which
you
didn't
see
here
at
list
the
–
it
wasn't
there
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
there.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
trial
or
the
transcript
could
it
be
made
available
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
this
is
the
matter
of
judicial
notice
even
though
it
wasn't
before
the
habeas
corpus
court?
justice
potter
stewart
professionally
notice
of
proceedings
on
their
own
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
could've
done
here.
it
could
be
also
done
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
that,
this
language
that
follows
what
you
read
to
as
on
the
bottom
of
page
30
of
the
record.
where
it
goes
along
and
says
that
“the
court
finds
that
no
rights
were
lost
at
this
time”
and
that
“he
was
actually
represented”
and
the
iowa
supreme
court
found
on
the
case
of
state
against
long,
he
was
at
all
times
represented
by
counsel.
it
seems
inconsistent.
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
he
had
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
a
lawyer
but
the
lawyer
decided
not
to
show
up
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
represented
by
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
this
is
really
a
holding
that
the
defendant
was
represented
by
counsel
at
all
crucial
times
or
relevant
times
and
that
then
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
this
doesn't
have
to
deal
a
kind
of
a
time
in
iowa
where
you
need
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
would
be
true
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
long
as
he
doesn't
lose
anything
at
the
preliminary
hearing
as
long
as
he
pleads
not
guilty.
the
attorney
general
hasn't
said
that
under
white
against
maryland,
you
need
to
have
a
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'd
expect
that
although
it's
not
issue
of
waiver
here;
that
you
pointed
out
at
26
and
so
forth,
30
rather.
well,
that's
an
issue
of
waiver.
counsel
wasn't
there,
went
on
and
then
these
things
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
waiver
gets
you
all
(inaudible)
problems
there
and
anything
else,
does
it?
don't
they
have
to
be
developed
at
the
--
if
the
state
is
going
to
rely
on
the
waiver,
i
would
suppose
the
facts
would
have
to
be
develop
at
the
habeas
hearing.
you
are
relying
here
as
i
understood
you
when
you
opened
your
argument,
say
you
are.
and
what
appears
in
the
trial
court's
finding
that
in
effect
there
was
a
waiver
by
the
lawyer
and
appearance
at
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
there
is
something
lesser
than
the
plea
of
guilty
and
may
be
something
else.
i
think
you've
told
us
that
that
shows
or
perhaps
as
mr.
carlson
said.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know,
mr.
bennett,
i
fully
appreciate
the
use
of
(inaudible)
but
i
must
say
it
presses
me
to
think.
that
there
is
going
to
be
more
time
of
viewers,
of
your
judges,
of
everyone
because
inevitably,
that
he
is
not
to
get
this
transcript
this
is
going
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
and
we're
all
going
to
find
out
the
misuse
anyway.
and
why
do
we
have
to
go
over
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
fully
--
you
(inaudible)
filing,
you
take
that
position
and
ask
that
it
be
decided
by
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
bennett,
in
this
appendix
to
your
brief,
you
have
attached
some
orders
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
and
what
do
they
mean
where
they
say
and
i'm
just
reading
one
at
random,
“it
is
hereby
ordered
that
plaintiff
may
file
nine
copies
that
we
have
typewritten
record
and
briefs
in
lieu
of
printed
record
and
briefs
to
be
used
by
the
court
upon
submission
of
the
appeal
in
this
case”.
now,
what
“record”
are
they
talking
about
there?
i
gathered
not
the
transcript
but
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
or
from
the
recollections
of
the
people
appearing,
would
it
be
what
justice
(inaudible)
heard
to
as
equivalent
to
a
bystander's
bill
of
exception
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
this
type
of
question
in
law
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
record
would
still
show
the
pleadings
and
the
orders
or
any
memoranda
of
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
is
in
the
citation.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
you
don't
represent.
we
just
appointed
you
to
represent
him
here.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
go
back
to
iowa,
he
may
still
be
what
otherwise
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
you
would
agree
with
mr.
bennett
that
if
we
correct
--
that's
what
our
judgment
should
be,
the
misunderstanding
based
on
this
being
a
civil
procedure
for
the
iowa
supreme
court.
i
gather
you
would
agree
with
mr.
bennett
that
the
rule
of
iowa
supreme
court
are
broad
enough
within
their
present
context
to
authorize
you
to
have
a
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
were
the
issues
on
the
merits
of
the
habeas
corpus
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
have
been
brought
to
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
counsel
on
this
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
that
he
had
had
counsel
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
something
damaging
had
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
basis
of
what
kind
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
so
that
was
a
factual
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
--
resolved
by
the
habeas
corpus
court.
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
record
before?
justice
potter
stewart
the
transcript
you
say
was
in
the
habeas
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
a
trial
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
record
was
made
at
the
habeas
hearing,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
issue
was
resolved
against
the
petitioner,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
as
an
appeal
from
the
resolution
of
the
issue
against
petitioner
joan
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
you
can't
do
that
effectively
except
as
you
have
copy
of
the
habeas
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
carlson,
what
you
referred
us
to
is
an
admission
by
the
state
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
for
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
told
me
that
you
needed
the
transcript
to
establish
that
fact
because
that
didn't
appear
in
the
recent
trial
record;
it
did
appear
in
the
habeas
record.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here's
a
concession
that
he
was
not
represented
to
that
by
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
didn't
make
this
concession
before
the
supreme
court
of
iowa?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
making
it
only
here?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
doesn't
do
you
any
good
as
the
judgment
against
you
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
--
that
was
in
the
habeas
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
--
the
question
whether
it
was
or
was
not
used
on
the
trial
of
the
court.
is
that
also
resulting
as
an
issue,
as
a
question
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
just
like
taking
your
time,
mr.
carlson.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
just
like
to
make
this
clear.
to
say
now
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
there's
been
an
admission
in
this
court
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong
and
he
did
not
in
fact
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
vacate
and
proceed
to
courtroom.
you
say
that
would
get
you
nowhere
since
there's
still
a
white-maryland
point
whether
or
not
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
was
introduced
to
the
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
no
evidence
was
taken
on
the
question
whether
it
was
introduced
at
the
criminal
trial
that
is
no
evidence
taken
at
the
habeas
hearing,
what
good
it
is
going
to
do
to
you
to
get
the
transcript
to
what
occurred
at
the
habeas
–
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
just
draw
that
instead
of
a
need
to
transcript
not
because
of
any
specific
question,
any
specific
reason
that
i
tell
you,
“i'm
just
plain
entitled
to
the
habeas
corpus
transcript
because
i'm
representing
this
man
on
appeal
and
i
have
to
know
what
went
on
there”.
there
may
be
that
--
that's
what
i
really
want.
you
want
to
engage
in
an
exploratory
examination
not
fishing
expedition.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
wrong
with
your
fishing,
i
would
say
that.
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
have
counsel
at
the
habeas
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
hearing?
was
he
there?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
asked
him
what
went
on
at
the
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
he
has
told
you
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
really,
you
will
find
out
something
more
out
of
the
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
you
found
those
from
looking
at
the
–-
afterwards
looking
at
the
trial
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
which
you
didn't
see
here
at
list
the
–
it
wasn't
there
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
there.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
trial
or
the
transcript
could
it
be
made
available
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
this
is
the
matter
of
judicial
notice
even
though
it
wasn't
before
the
habeas
corpus
court?
justice
potter
stewart
professionally
notice
of
proceedings
on
their
own
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
could've
done
here.
it
could
be
also
done
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
that,
this
language
that
follows
what
you
read
to
as
on
the
bottom
of
page
30
of
the
record.
where
it
goes
along
and
says
that
“the
court
finds
that
no
rights
were
lost
at
this
time”
and
that
“he
was
actually
represented”
and
the
iowa
supreme
court
found
on
the
case
of
state
against
long,
he
was
at
all
times
represented
by
counsel.
it
seems
inconsistent.
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
he
had
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
a
lawyer
but
the
lawyer
decided
not
to
show
up
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
represented
by
a
lawyer.
justice

i
suppose,
this
is
really
a

that

if

--
justice
potter
stewart
as
long
as
he
doesn't
lose
anything
at
the
preliminary
hearing
as
long
as
he
pleads
not
guilty.
the
attorney
general
hasn't
said
that
under
white
against
maryland,
you
need
to
have
a
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'd
expect
that
although
it's
not
issue
of
waiver
here;
that
you
pointed
out
at
26
and
so
forth,
30
rather.
well,
that's
an
issue
of
waiver.
counsel
wasn't
there,
went
on
and
then
these
things
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
waiver
gets
you
all
(inaudible)
problems
there
and
anything
else,
does
it?
don't
they
have
to
be
developed
at
the
--
if
the
state
is
going
to
rely
on
the
waiver,
i
would
suppose
the
facts
would
have
to
be
develop
at
the
habeas
hearing.
you
are
relying
here
as
i
understood
you
when
you
opened
your
argument,
say
you
are.
and
what
appears
in
the
trial
court's
finding
that
in
effect
there
was
a
waiver
by
the
lawyer
and
appearance
at
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
there
is
something
lesser
than
the
plea
of
guilty
and
may
be
something
else.
i
think
you've
told
us
that
that
shows
or
perhaps
as
mr.
carlson
said.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know,
mr.
bennett,
i
fully
appreciate
the
use
of
(inaudible)
but
i
must
say
it
presses
me
to
think.
that
there
is
going
to
be
more
time
of
viewers,
of
your
judges,
of
everyone
because
inevitably,
that
he
is
not
to
get
this
transcript
this
is
going
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
and
we're
all
going
to
find
out
the
misuse
anyway.
and
why
do
we
have
to
go
over
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
fully
--
you
(inaudible)
filing,
you
take
that
position
and
ask
that
it
be
decided
by
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
bennett,
in
this
appendix
to
your
brief,
you
have
attached
some
orders
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
and
what
do
they
mean
where
they
say
and
i'm
just
reading
one
at
random,
“it
is
hereby
ordered
that
plaintiff
may
file
nine
copies
that
we
have
typewritten
record
and
briefs
in
lieu
of
printed
record
and
briefs
to
be
used
by
the
court
upon
submission
of
the
appeal
in
this
case”.
now,
what
“record”
are
they
talking
about
there?
i
gathered
not
the
transcript
but
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
or
from
the
recollections
of
the
people
appearing,
would
it
be
what
justice
(inaudible)
heard
to
as
equivalent
to
a
bystander's
bill
of
exception
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
this
type
of
question
in
law
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
record
would
still
show
the
pleadings
and
the
orders
or
any
memoranda
of
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
is
in
the
citation.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
you
don't
represent.
we
just
appointed
you
to
represent
him
here.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
go
back
to
iowa,
he
may
still
be
what
otherwise
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
you
would
agree
with
mr.
bennett
that
if
we
correct
--
that's
what
our
judgment
should
be,
the
misunderstanding
based
on
this
being
a
civil
procedure
for
the
iowa
supreme
court.
i
gather
you
would
agree
with
mr.
bennett
that
the
rule
of
iowa
supreme
court
are
broad
enough
within
their
present
context
to
authorize
you
to
have
a
transcript.
