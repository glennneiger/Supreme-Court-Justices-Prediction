brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
i
understand
the
concession
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
one
i
am
looking
at
the
page
5
of
the
state's
brief.
while
the
trial
court
erred
in
its
reason
for
denying
the
transcript,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
the
supreme
court
can
--
we
contend
that
the
real
issue
is,
whether
the
petitioner
can
obtain
adequate
appellate
review
without
a
free
hearing
transcript.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
twenty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that's
the
trial
record,
is
it,
or
is
that
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
and
as
well
not
the
habeas
record
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
wants
that
blue
covered
book
and
you
don't
want
to
give
it
to
him.
[laughter]
that's
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
that's
the
concrete
factual
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes,
but
he
says
that
he
not
only
wants
that
book,
that
he
is
entitled
to
it
because
he
needs
it
to
have
a
meaningful
appeal.
you
say
he
would
be
entitled
to
it
if
he
did
get
it
to
have
a
meaningful
appeal
but
he
doesn't
need
it
to
have
a
meaningful
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
there's
nothing
went
on
anyway
that
they
need
the
transcript
or
even
if
there
is,
there's
another
way
for
him
to
make
up
the
kind
of
the
record
he
needs
for
a
meaningful
appeal,
no.
