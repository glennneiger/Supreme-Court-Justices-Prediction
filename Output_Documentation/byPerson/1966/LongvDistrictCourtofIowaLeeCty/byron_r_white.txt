justice
byron
r.
white
was
a
testimony
of
where
the
proceedings
taken
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
customary
in
iowa
in
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
the
transcript
been
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
but
what
about
the
trial
transcript
itself
at
the
criminal
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
have
the
transcript
of
the
habeas
hearing.
you
have
available
the
transcript
in
the
criminal
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that
doesn't
show
whether
that
evidence
was
introduced;
nothing
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
don't
see
why
you
need
the
transcript
to
the
habeas
hearing
just
to
show
what
went
on
at
the
trial
because
the
trial
transcript
shows
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
do
you
need
the
transcript?
you
don't
need
the
transcript
of
the
habeas
hearing
with
respect
to
whether
you
had
counsel
for
preliminary
hearing
because
it's
been
a
concession.
you
don't
need,
it
seems
to
me,
the
transcript
to
the
habeas
hearing
to
show
up
what
went
on
at
the
trial
because
the
trial
transcript
is
by
far
that
(inaudible)
to
that.
so
now,
why
do
you
really
need
the
transcript
in
habeas
hearing?
i
agree
with
you
that
this
iowa,
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
has
conceded
that
if
you
can
demonstrate
a
need
on
appeal
for
the
transcript
that
you
are
entitled
of
transcript.
that's
what
the
major
point
in
this
case
seems
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
that
has
conceded,
the
same
has
conceded.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
don't
know
why
you
need
that
transcript
in
the
habeas
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
incompetency
--
that's
a
good
blanket
word
but
what
specifically
was
that
the
trial
transcript
would
show
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
you
find
out
how
counsel
for
this
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
agree
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong,
gave
the
wrong
reason
for
denying
the
request
for
a
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
petition
for
the
cert
in
the
iowa
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
have
to
do
is
return
over
that
document
to
him
and
the
case
is
over
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
shows
cross
examination?
an
effort
by
the
da
to
find
out
what
it
was
he
had
admitted
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
take
the
same
position,
in
all
fairness,
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
as
you
have
taken
here.
the
issue
would
make
up
the
same
way:
you
just
need
transcript
at
all
in
order
to
have
a
meaningful
appeal.
and
there
--
and
because
there
is
a
meaningful
state
procedure
available
where
in
to
vindicate
its
constitutional
rights.
you
could
make
up
the
same
sort
of
an
issue
there
as
here.
but
let
me
ask
you.
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
in
this
case
that
is
presented
here
on
the
petitioner
for
certiorari,
as
far
as
we
were
concerned,
we
were
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
trial
court
of
iowa
because
the
writ,
the
appeal
has
been
denied
and
we
were
reviewing
a
ruling
of
the
trial
court
entered
after
a
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
this
man
was
not
entitled
to
a
transcript
in
any
event
because
this
was
a
civil
proceeding.
and
that
issue,
and
as
far
as
we
knew,
and
as
far
as
we
still
know,
that
is
the
law
of
iowa.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
never
said
otherwise
or
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
never
said
otherwise,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose,
if
this
be
speculated
on
your
part,
what
if
this
court
said,
“no,
the
law
is,
you
must
have
a
transcript”
or
some
other
way
available
to
protect
his
appeal?
now
your
response
is,
“well,
these
rules
are
not
or
without
having
to
buy
a
transcript
at
all”.
do
you
think
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
never
been
through
that
issue,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
whether
they
would
agree
with
you
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
could
have
denied
because
they
could
have
said
that
this
is
a
civil
proceeding
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
transcript
in
any
event.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
can't
give
us
any
case
in
iowa
that
says
that
the
rule
about
an
indigent
in
a
criminal
case
applies
to
a
habeas
corpus
case.
there's
no
ruling
like
that
in
iowa,
is
it?
there's
no
supreme
court
holding
in
iowa
that
says
that
an
indigent
petitioner
in
habeas
corpus
is
entitled
to
a
free
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
we
know
the
rule
that
in
a
civil
proceeding,
he
is
not
entitled
to
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
--
when
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
before
long.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
this
court
took
this
case
and
reversed
it
and
--
to
what
court
would
it
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
this
court
just
took
the
--
this
one
as
far
as
saying
the
--
what
i
understand
with
the
law
of
iowa
to
be
at
least
the
decision,
the
rule
of
law
in
the
decision
which
we
are
reviewing
said
that:
this
is
a
civil
proceedings,
no
transcript.
we
reverse
that
and
iowa
must
have
observe
another
rule.
and
we
reversed
the
further
proceeding
consistent
with
this
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
we
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
then
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
would
have
the
job
of
saying,
how
--
in
the
light
of
iowa
procedures,
should
we
implement
this
constitutional
rule,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
might
not
decide
but
in
this
case,
there
was
to
be
a
transcript
or
it
might
remand
the
trial
court
for
further
proceedings.
we
don't
know
how
the
iowa
would
react
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
iowa
supreme
court
never
had
a
crack.
that
you're
showing
because
they
never
get
to
it.
they
never
get
to
the
question
because
they
say
this
is
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
the
iowa
supreme
court
might
decide
the
same
thing.
but
if
they
thought
you
are
really
asking
for
something
that
where
you
needed
the
transcript
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
quite
an
argument
between
the
two
of
you,
why
do
you
really
need
the
transcript
of
that?
it's
not
as
you
say
a
black
and
white
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
say
that
he
wouldn't
have
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
do
you
think
is
going
to
happen?
[voice
overlap]
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
bound
to
have
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
we
have
already
held
that,
haven't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
held
that
on
the
(inaudible).
we
had
a
case
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
in
post
conviction
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
he
might
go
back
to
that
lawyer
in
the
iowa
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did
a
good
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
a
testimony
of
where
the
proceedings
taken
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
customary
in
iowa
in
habeas

justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
the
transcript
been
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
but
what
about
the
trial
transcript
itself
at
the
criminal
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
doesn't
mean
you

you
have

justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that
doesn't
show
whether
that

nothing
was

justice
byron

white
so
i
don't
see
why
you
need
the
transcript
to
the
habeas
hearing
just
to
show
what
went
on
at
the
trial
because
the
trial
transcript
shows
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
do
you
need
the
transcript?
you
don't
need
the
transcript
of
the
habeas
hearing
with
respect
to
whether
you
had
counsel
for
preliminary
hearing
because
it's

you
don't

it

me,
the

to
show
up
what
went
on
at

because

so
now,
why
do

i

that

the

that's
what
the
major
point
in
this
case
seems
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
that
has
conceded,
the
same
has
conceded.
justice
byron

white
--
i
don't
know
why
you
need
that
transcript
in
the
habeas
