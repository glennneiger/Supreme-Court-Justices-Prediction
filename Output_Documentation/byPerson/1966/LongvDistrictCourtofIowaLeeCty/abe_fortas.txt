justice

fortas
mr.
carlson,
at
any
time,
did
they,
in
any
of
these
proceedings,
did
the
petitioner
receive
the
transcript?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
that's
what
he
wants
here?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
transcript
after
this
trial
before
the
court
on
habeas
corpus?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
that
jurisdiction
--
you
are
not
depriving
an
appeal
the
proof
of
the
essence
of
the
transcript?
justice
abe
fortas
when
is
this
concession
of
appeared?
just
tell
me,
is
it
in
your
brief,
or
the
record
or
–
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
the
attorney
general's
office
make
that
concession
at
the
habeas
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
just
in
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
reason
suppose
they
withdraw
the
concession,
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

stipulation,
now
the
attorney
general
that
when
that
appeal
is
heard,
you
will
say
that
the
trial
court
is
in
error.
you
find
him
to
be
handcuffed
so
you
are
probably
over.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know,
mr.
carlson,
but
it
looks
to
me
as
that
the
attorney
general
on
page
20
expressed
pretty
clearly
reserves
the
conclusion
of
law.
it
says
that
petitioner
probably
is
entitled
to
relief
in
habeas
corpus
in
the
white
against
maryland.
that
would
cover
a
reservation
of
the
question
as
to
whether
the
admissions
made
with
preliminary
examinations
were
used
against
him
at
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
is
the
rule
in
iowa,
this
matter
--
if
there
is
one
formulated
so
to
tell
us
those?
there's
an
opinion
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
from
denial
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
request
here
and
i
take
it
as
one
of
the
separate
ancillary
or
collateral
proceeding
done
by
application
in
the
district
court
in
iowa
and
then
petitioner's
certiorari
was
filed
from
the
denial
of
that
application
and
this
is
to
say
the
application
for
the
habeas
corpus
transcript,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
only
part
of
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
is
a
denial
of
the
certiorari.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
iowa
supreme
court
still
is
considering.
it
has
before
it
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
now
is
the
rule
or
is
there
a
rule
on
the
iowa
supreme
court,
decisions
of
this
iowa
supreme
court
in
no
event
will
that
court
order
that
a
transcript
of
habeas
corpus
proceeding
be
made
available
--
justice
abe
fortas
or
they
formulated
some
other
rule.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
--
any
holding
in
the
iowa
supreme
court?
justice
abe
fortas
nothing
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
never
for
example
said
that
“we
will
make
a
case
by
case
determination
and
it
doesn't
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
showing
that
the
transcript
is
needed?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
broad
--
we
are
confronted
with
the
broad
rule
of
law
here
to
the
effect
that
in
no
event
will
the
iowa
supreme
court
reverse
a
trial
court's
holding
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
transcript
will
not
be
furnished
on
habeas
corpus.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
refer
a
standing
case
in
which
iowa
supreme
court
has
ordered
a
transcript
to
be
furnished
in
these
circumstances?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
you
go
on
and
say
that
this
petitioner
could
demonstrate
satisfactorily
to
you
that
for
a
meaningful
appeal,
you
needed
the
habeas
corpus
transcript
that
he
is
entitled
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
but
you
can't
speak
for
your
supreme
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
was
it
open
to
the
supreme
court?
[laughter]
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
open
in
your
view
to
the
supreme
court
to
decide
if
this
man
is
entitled
to
the
transcript?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
open
to
your
supreme
court
when
the
appeal
is
heard
to
say
that
this
man
should
have
a
transcript
or
they
foreclosed
by
any
of
their
prior
decisions?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
short
of
the
transcript?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
he
wasn't?
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
then
the
supreme
court
says,
“well,
this
record
is
not
good
enough
for
us,
we
can't
tell
you
or
we
cant'
decide
this
thing.
there's
no
transcript
here.
we
can't
give
him
the
transcript
because
of
civil
proceeding,
are
they
foreclosed
by
their
prior
decisions
in
saying
that
they
will
order
up
an
adequate
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
yes?
justice
abe
fortas
this
trial
court
has
refused
to
do
it.
justice
abe
fortas
this
case
went
back
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
this
appeal
is
heard.
is
there
an
opportunity
for
this
man
to
persuade
the
supreme
court
that
he
does
needed
this
transcript
to
the
habeas
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
don't
know
of
any
decision
in
your
books
that
would
prevent
the
supreme
court
from
saying
that
these
circumstances
will
require
a
transcript?
justice
abe
fortas
he
was
personally
there
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
a
witness
there?
justice
