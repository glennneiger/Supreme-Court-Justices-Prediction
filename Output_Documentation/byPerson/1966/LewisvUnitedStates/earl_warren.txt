was
there
any
question
of
entrapment
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
question
as
to
probable
cause
for
his
going
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
it's
simply
a
question
as
to
whether
in
these
circumstances,
the
officer
had
to
right
to
go
to
the
home
and
complete
a
sale?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
in
the
case
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
had
informed
jimmy
that
he
was
open
to
making
sales
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
was
a
building,
not
his
home
--
a
building
where
he
operated
behind
closed
doors
and
only
admitted
those
whom
he
knew,
whom
he
thought
he
could
safely
sell
narcotics
to
and
we
had
the
same
deception
that
you
speak
of
with
that
effect,
would
that
affect
your
case
at
all
or
would
it
be
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
if
he
had
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
there's
no
question
of
probable
cause
here
because
a
man
was
invited
in
whether
it
was
through
deception
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
he
--
couldn't
he
go
on
there
to
search
the
place
for
the
instruments
of
crime
if
a
man
said,
“yes,
come
on
to
my
house.
i
think
maybe
i
can
take
care
of
it.”
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
there
was
some
narcotics
there
that
he
expected
to
use
in
the
commission
of
a
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
wouldn't
have
the
marijuana?

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
klarfeld,
if
your
position
is
sustained,
would
it
not
be
possible
for
all
of
the
narcotic
violators
of
the
country
to
operate
in
a
building
where
they
had
established
a
bed
and
a
dresser
and
perhaps
a
few
personal
articles
and
call
that
their
home
and
then
operate
inviting
people
to
come
there
and
then
do
so
with
a
feeling
of
absolute
security
that
no
one
who
came
to
that
establishment
and
dealt
with
him
could
possibly
be
one
who
is
going
to
involve
him
with
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
your
answer
to
my
question
would
be
that
they
could
do
that.
