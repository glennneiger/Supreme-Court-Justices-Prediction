but
you
normally
don't
think
there
is
somebody
going
to
be
hidden
in
a
trunk
of
the
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
wonder
that
he
did
get
the
search
warrant
whether
your
problem
really
would
be
solved
because
the
source
of
the
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
is
the
agent's
misrepresentation
over
the
telephone
when
he
talked
to
him
on
the
phone
and
the
invites
him
over
because
he
really
thinks
he's
an
ordinary
potential
customer.
based
on
this
conversation,
the
agent
will
search
warrant,
he
goes
to
the
door
and
executes
it.i
would
think
the
owner
of
the
house
will
say,
“well,
your
entry
here
is
fraudulent
as
it
can
be
because
you
lied
to
me.
the
government
lied
to
me
and
i
am
--
and
in
effect
you've
lied
your
way
into
my
house.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
what
if
he
relies
on
the
phone
call
for
the
probable
cause.
he
goes
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
the
magistrate
and
says
what
--
what's
your
probable
cause?
well,
i
just
talked
on
the
phone.
i
was
invited
over
to
buy
some
marijuana
and
well
then
the
magistrate
(inaudible)
to
me,
here
is
your
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
cause
is
sufficient,
it
just
happens
to
be
barred
by
the
fourth
amendment
on
your
argument.
