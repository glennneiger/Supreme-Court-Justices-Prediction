your
argument
seems
to
me
that
if
an
officer
does
not
tell
the
dope
seller
that
he's
an
officer,
goes
into
his
home
to
buy
dope
from
him,
he
is
an
officer
and
he
hasn't
told
him.
does
that
violate
the
fourth
amendment?

just
because
he
doesn't
tell
it.

it
is
we
are
going
to
move
it
up
now
to
where
the
government
agents
have
to
tell
a
man
in
advance
that
as
an
agent
so
that
he
won't
violate
the
law
in
their
person?
justice

was
this
officer
invited

did
you
say
that

justice

--
that
the
officer
should
have
told
you
that
he's
an
officer?
justice
hugo

if
the
officer
had
told
him
he's
an
officer,
he's
still
have
been
alright,
wouldn't
he?
justice

you
--
you
don't
have
proposition
which
protects
people
from
officers
who
invited
in
there
to
break
the
law?
justice

wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo

well,
it
would
protect
him
here
if
he
invited
him
in
and
you
want
to
buy
this
and
use
of
this
as
evidence,
that
would
certainly
protect
him,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo

but
he
didn't
break
in,
he
just
went
in
on
his
invitation.
