justice

fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
suppose
this
had
really
been
jimmy
the
pollack
but
all
the
other
facts
were
the
same
but
he
acted
as
government
informer,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
it's
not
crucial
in
your
analysis
whether
the
person
is
a
government
employee
or
officer
or
a
non-government
informer?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
was
not?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
was
not
paid
by
the
government?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
conceptually,
why
do
you
make
that
distinction?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
resting
entirely
on
the
law
of
the
search
and
seizure
by
the
government
or
by
somebody,
some
person
might
be
as
a
government
agent?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
you
mind
repeating
how
you
disposed
of
the
fifth
amendment
point
and
if
you
stated
it,
i
didn't
follow
you
mr.
spritzer.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
waiver
doctrine
but
it's
a
plenty
kind
of
a
waiver,
isn't
it?
and
it's
a
--
he
doesn't
know
that
the
person
whom
he
is
talking
is
a
government
agent
and
that
this
person
--
part
of
the
plan
is
that
this
person
will
use
it
to
in
a
legal
proceeding,
a
prosecution
and
legal
proceeding
against
him
so
it's
a
funny
kind
of
a
waiver,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
--
you
don't
have
to
have
a
compulsion
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
to
you
that
is
a
very
little,
how
can
spies
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
you
don't
have
to
have
overt
compulsion.
here
there's
deceit
by
the
nature
of
things
or
no
matter
lawful
or
not
it's
in
an
essentially
deceitful
situation
in
which
a
person
in
effect
is
invited,
implicitly
invited
to
make
statements
with
the
intention
on
the
part
of
the
auditor
and
lack
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
speaker
that
those
statements
will
be
use
to
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
issue.
your
statement
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
area
of
being
an
issue
and
look
at
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
have
forgotten,
in
trupiano,
was
there
also
an
electronic
device?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
you
believe
it
makes
any
difference
--
i
know
this
was
subject
to
debate
between
majority
in
dissent
in
lopez
and
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
it
makes
any
difference
that
a
recording
is
made
of
this
conversation
between
the
government
informer
and
the
defendant?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it
is.
as
a
theoretical
manner
whether
one
was
made,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
view
to
the
effect
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
just
a
minute
mr.
klarfeld.
with
the
search
warrant
help,
in
getting
of
the
search
warrant,
the
usual
sense
anyway,
the
government
agent
did
not
conduct
a
search
here.
now
suppose
a
government
agent
wants
to
go
in
and
to
talk
to
someone
about
a
crime
that's
been
committed.
he
knocks
on
the
door,
he's
invited
to
come
in
and
he
talks
to
the
persons,
and
what
develops,
develops,
doesn't
it?
if
the
federal
agent,
let's
suppose
a
narcotics
agent
or
an
fbi
agent
goes
into
the
house
and
found
any
preconceived
idea
that
the
occupant
of
the
house
is
going
to
tell
him
anything
that
will
lead
to
an
arrest,
would
you
say
that
the
search
warrant
--
that
search
warrant
would
be
necessary
for
the
validity
of
the
arrest
in
those
circumstances?
justice
abe
fortas
the
crime
has
been
committed.
an
fbi
agent
is
investigating.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
so
he
goes
to
the
house
of
a
neighbor,
let's
say,
somebody
near
the
scene
of
the
crime.
he
knocks
on
the
door.
the
occupant
says,
"come
in".
justice
abe
fortas
the
neighbor,
yes.
the
fbi
agent
starts
asking
questions
and
pretty
soon
it
develops
that
the
person
to
whom
he
is
talking
committed
the
crime.
now,
would
you
say
that
no
circumstances
the
entry
into
the
house
was
unlawful
or
that
the
fbi
agent
cannot
testify
as
to
the
conversation
because
it
didn't
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
he
had
to
take
the
second
illustration.
there
is
a
second
--
second
question.
suppose
he
had.
they
thought
maybe
this
fellow
did
it
but
he
didn't
get
a
search
warrant.
he
goes
to
the
house,
knocks
on
the
door,
invited
him,
let's
suppose
he
has
probable
cause.
he
is
invited
into
the
house
and
he
then
interrogates
the
occupant
of
the
house
and
the
occupant
gives
him
facts
that
result
in
an
arrest
and
the
agent
--
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
agent
cannot
subsequently
testify
as
to
that
conversation
because
he
had
probable
cause
to
suspect
the
occupant
but
he
didn't
get
a
search
warrant.
he
just
relied
upon
the
invitation.
he
went
to
the
door,
knocked
on,
was
invited
in,
that's
all
that
happened.
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
proposition
really
is
something
more
than
the
unlawful
entry
on
the
house.
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
search
warrant
has
to
be
obtained
when
a
government
agent
wants
to
enter
a
premise
--
wants
to
enter
somebody's
house
in
a
disguise.
justice
abe
fortas
and
a
disguise
might
create
the
necessity
for
the
search
warrant.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
has
really
been

justice
abe
