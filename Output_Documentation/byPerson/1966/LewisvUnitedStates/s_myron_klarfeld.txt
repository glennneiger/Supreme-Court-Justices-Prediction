mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
the
lewis
case
is
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
is
violated
when
a
government
agent
gains
entrance
to
the
home
of
citizen
without
a
search
warrant
and
by
disguise
and
deception
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
a
crime
and
obtaining
evidence
to
be
used
against
him.
the
facts
briefly
are
as
follows.
on
december
3,
1964,
a
man
by
the
name
of
jimmy
the
pollack
telephoned
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
telling
him
that
a
mutual
friend
had
said
that
the
petitioner
had
some
marijuana
and
that
he,
jimmy,
wanted
to
buy
some.
the
petitioner
responded
that
the
mutual
friend
had
mentioned
jimmy
and
jimmy
thereby
procured
an
invitation
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
some
marijuana.
jimmy
the
pollack
arrived
at
the
petitioner's
home,
went
into
the
apartment,
sat
down,
they
discussed
the
price,
made
his
purchase
and
prior
to
leaving,
jimmy
the
pollack
stated
that
if
he
was
satisfied
as
to
the
quality
of
the
marijuana
that
he
would
probably
give
mr.
lewis
a
telephone
call
in
a
few
weeks
and
return
to
get
some
additional
marijuana.
several
weeks
later
on
december
17,
1964,
jimmy
the
pollack
again
telephoned
the
home
of
the
petitioner
and
stated
that
he
wanted
some
additional
marijuana.
again,
he
went
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
where
he
received
his
marijuana.
almost
five
months
later,
on
april
26,
1965,
jimmy
the
pollack
again
showed
up
at
the
petitioner's
home,
only
this
time,
he
came
with
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
mr.
lewis.
prior
to
the
trial,
the
petitioner
had
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
used
to
convict
mr.
lewis
at
the
trial
and
that
motion
was
seeking
to
suppress
the
evidence,
admissions,
and
conversations
which
the
petitioner
alleged
were
procured
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
jimmy
the
pollack
in
reality
was
mr.
edward
cass,
an
undercover
agent
for
the
narcotics
bureau
of
the
treasury
department.
he
was
--
he
was
called
to
the
witness
stand
on
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
and
was
asked
the
following
questions
and
gave
the
following
replies.
question:
at
some
time
during
your
investigation
prior
to
the
arrest
of
mr.
lewis,
did
the
defendant
mr.
lewis
become
a
suspect?
answer:
yes,
he
did.
question:
can
you
tell
us
when
it
time
that
was
mr.
cass?
answer:
yes,
sir,
in
1963.
i
bring
this
respectively
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
remind
the
court
that
the
two
purchases
which
were
made
were
made
in
december
of
1964.
the
defendant
therefore
was
a
suspect
for
over
a
year
prior
to
a
time
when
these
two
buys
were
made.
question:
on
or
about
thursday,
december
3,
1964,
did
you
communicate
by
telephone
with
the
defendant
prior
to
going
to
his
home?
answer:
yes
sir,
i
did.
question:
was
the
purpose
of
your
telephone
call
on
this
date
sir
to
inquire
about
a
purchase
of
about
a
quantity
of
marijuana?
answer:
it
was.
question:
on
said
dates,
december
3,
and
december
17,
1964,
mr.
cass,
did
you
pose
as
someone
other
than
the
federal
officer
that
you
are?
answer:
i
did.
question:
whether
or
not
you
represented
your
self
to
the
defendant
on
those
occasions,
that
you
were
jimmy
the
pollack
operating
a
bar
and
grill
in
rhode
island.
answer:
that
is
correct.
question:
when
you
went
to
the
defendant's
home
on
december
3
and
december
17,
mr.
cass,
did
you
have
a
search
warrant
for
that
purpose?
answer:
i
did
not.
question:
at
the
time
you
went
to
the
defendant's
home
on
december
3,
1964,
did
you
suspect
from
information
you
had
received
prior
thereto
or
based
on
your
own
personal
knowledge
or
otherwise
that
the
transaction
might
take
place
at
the
home
of
the
defendant
so
far
as
the
transfer
of
marijuana
is
concerned?
question:
when
you
went
to
the
home
of
the
defendant
on
december
3
and
december
17,
mr.
cass,
did
you
not
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
narcotics
from
him?
at
page
31
of
the
record,
the
fact
is
disclosed
that
one,
richard
gold
was
the
informer
who
had
put
the
agent
in
touch
with
mr.
lewis.
the
petitioner
waived
a
trial
by
jury
as
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
according
to
law
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not,
unless,
you
would
consider
the
conversations
an
admission.
that's
all
the
case
in
the
apartment.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
the
question
--
the
defense
of
entrapment
was
not
raise
at
the
trial
court.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor,
there
wasn't.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
without
a
search
warrant.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
petitioner's
argument
for
reversal
is
based
on
six
brief
grounds.
first,
the
circuit
court
in
confirming
the
convictions
relied
on
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
pasquinzo,
334
federal
2d
page
74.
this
was
a
ninth
circuit
case
where
the
agent
was
in
disguise
but
the
purchase
of
the
narcotics
took
place
in
a
drugstore
which
is
a
place
in
business
open
to
the
public.
and
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
situation
from
the
one
that
is
presented
before
the
bar
this
morning.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
would
have
no
objections
to
it,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
addition
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
sir.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct.
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
this
informer
would
be
paid
by
the
government
in
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
if
he
was
not
paid
by
the
government
but
simply
volunteered
to
do
this
by
himself
and
then
subsequently
had
a
change
of
heart
and
decided
he
would
go
to
the
government
and
say
i
know
of
a
man
who
has
committed
a
crime,
i
would
not
have
the
objection
that
i
have
here
this
morning.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
because,
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
i
will
set
forth
a
little
further
in
my
argument
precludes
the
government
either
directly
or
indirectly
through
a
paid
informer
of
gaining
entrance
to
the
house
in
this
manner
and
i
would
like
to
develop
that
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
person
who
gained
entrance
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
was
a
narcotics
agent.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
not
a
really
a
question,
your
honor.
the
conversation
as
related
in
the
record
states
that
when
the
agent
told
the
petitioner
that
a
mutual
friend
had
indicated
that
he
had
some
for
sale,
the
petitioner
responded,
“yes,
jimmy.
he
told
me
about
you.
i
think
i
might
be
able
to
help
you”
or
words
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
the
government
has
cited
--
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no
your
honor.
oh!
excuse
me
your
honor.
from
an
office?
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
his
office.
i
maintain
that
if
mr.
lewis
has
done
this
on
a
street
or
in
some
public
place,
there
would
be
no
question
here
usually
from
my
limited
experience,
your
honor.
most
of
the
agents
will
make
their
buys
in
the
street,
in
an
agent's
automobile
or
some
public
place.
only
this
time,
the
agent
took
a
depart
himself
to
go
to
the
front
door
of
the
home
of
the
defendant
without
a
search
warrant
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
petitioner's
contention.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
he
could
have
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
if
i
may
digress
from
my
argument
for
a
moment
to
answer,
your
honor.
i
feel
in
my
heart
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
the
proposition
that
you
stated,
the
government
ought
not
to
participate
in
the
solicitation
of
crimes
in
the
obtaining
of
evidence
in
this
regard.
but
unfortunately,
in
this
particular
instance,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
purchase
took
place
in
the
home
of
the
defendant,
i
find
myself
for
the
moment
anyhow
confined
to
that
general
area.
i
truly
feel
there's
no
distinction
from
what
your
honor
has
said
but
for
the
basis
of
this
case
this
morning,
i'm
going
to
confine
it
to
the
home.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
he
goes
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
there
are
several
aspects
to
that.
that
is
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
i
think
it
goes
deeper
than
that,
your
honor.
i
think
where
this
agent
had
this
information
in
advance
and
had
already
previously
made
arrangements
to
go
to
the
home
and
make
the
purchase
that
under
those
circumstances,
he
should've
at
least
applied
for
if
not
obtain
a
search
warrant.
and
i'd
like
to
bring
that
on
a
little
further
in
my
argument.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
with
the
search
warrant,
your
honor,
having
previously
arranged
to
go
to
the
defendant's
home
to
procure
the
marijuana
and
if
your
honor
will
recall,
i
mentioned
that
he
had
information
from
an
informer.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
he
might
very
well
have
executed
the
search
warrant
and
just
said,
“where
is
it”
or
look
for
it
at
that
particular
time.
or
he
may
have
kept
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor
but
then
he
certainly
would
be
in
violation
of
the
law
in
possession
of
the
narcotics
without
the
proper
forum.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
with
all
my
heart,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor.
i
do.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
truthfully.i
think
that
it
would
be
the
same
i
think
that
is
the
line
of
reasoning
the
justice
stewart
has
suggested
to
me
this
morning.
i
must
confess
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
if
the
government
themselves
originate
and
start
the
chain
of
events
which
leads
up
to
something
like
this
where
they
obtain
evidence
in
disguise.
it's
something
this
court
has
discussed
at
great
lengths
in
many
cases
and
that's
why
i'm
forced
this
morning
to
try
if
possible
to
keep
myself
in
the
home
because
if
i
get
outside
the
home,
i'm
going
to
be
(inaudible)
a
little
bit.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
there
have
been
cases
which
you
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
there
have
been
some
that
have
been
close,
your
honor,
if
i
may
use
the
term.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
the
cook
versus
the
united
states
was
a
situation
where
an
agent
was
going
--
an
informer
was
going
to
buy
some
bootleg
whiskey
and
they
put
the
agent
in
the
trunk
of
the
automobile
while
the
other
one
drove
the
car
into
the
landowner's
--
inside
his
fence
and
the
court
held
that
in
following
gouled,
that
this
was
a
type
of
a
fraudulent
entry
into
the
home.
it's
the
entry
into
the
home
procured
by
fraud
if
the
petitioner
appeals
that
the
petitioner
appeals.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
sir.
but
the
man
who
was
driving
the
car
was.
you
see,
the
two
of
them
were
working
together.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
suppose
you
do.
but
the
--
the
government
has
in
their
brief
alluded
to
the
lopez
case
in
opposition
to
the
petitioner's
position.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lopez
case,
the
government
agent
from
internal
revenue
went
to
the
premises
of
the
defendant
asked
the
government
agent
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
operation
of
the
café
made
it
subject
to
the
cabaret
tax
and
why
he
was
there
in
his
official
capacity,
the
defendant
tried
to
bribe
him
and
that
was
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted.
my
second
ground
deals
with
the
prior
law
in
this
particular
point
and
i
feel
that
the
lewis
case
is
in
line
with
the
gouled
the
rakes
case
which
is
a
massachusetts
case
incidentally
where
a
supervisor
from
the
alcohol
tax
division
went
out
to
see
his
tenant
farmer
and
said,
“hi!
the
boss
had
sent
me
down
to
fix
this
still.”
whereupon,
the
defendant
said,
“alright,
here
are
the
keys,
it's
in
that
barn
over
there.”
this
type
of
a
deceptive
practice
and
the
rakes
case
also
relied
on
gouled.
the
cook
case
was
the
one
i
described
with
the
agent
in
the
trunk
and
in
gatewood
versus
the
united
states,
209
f.2d
where
the
officers
weren't
necessarily
invited
to
the
premises
but
they
did
knock
outside
the
door
of
the
defendants
and
when
asked
who's
there,
the
agents
replied,
“western
union”
and
of
course
gained
entrance
by
that
type
of
a
deceptive
practice.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
on
page
19
of
their
brief
states
the
shield
which
the
fourth
amendment
directs
around
the
home
is
designed
to
keep
out
unwanted
intruders
and
if
my
history
serves
me
correctly,
your
honor,
in
the
beginning
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
drafted,
the
unwarranted
intruder
at
that
time
was
government
and
i
submit
if
the
government
disguises
itself,
it's
still
the
unwanted
intruder
so
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned.
the
disguise
will
not
change
the
identity
of
the
government.
my
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
he
had
called.
he
telephoned
the
home
of
petitioner
first,
your
honor
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
buy
some
marijuana
and
on
the
strength
of
that,
he
was
invited
over
to
the
defendant's
petitioner's
home.
my
third
ground
for
reversal
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
if
the
officer
had
told
him
he
was
an
officer,
your
honor,
i'm
quite
sure,
he
wouldn't
have
been
invited.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
there
have
been
no
sale,
no
transaction
and
probably
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor
on
that
particular
point.
i
have
covered
that
in
the
remaining
section
of
my
argument
and
i
think
that
your
honor
will
have
an
answer
to
that.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
individuals
i
think
in
their
home
and
that
protection
must
be
equally
extended
to
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty.
i
can't
determine
in
my
own
mind
how
we
could
divide
and
say
in
one
instance
we
will
give
the
homeowner
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
in
another
instance
because
he's
a
criminal
or
he's
up
to
some
evil
deed,
we
won't
give
it
to
him.
now,
he's
going
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor,
but
he
is
an
officer
of
the
government.
he
had
ample
opportunity
and
time
to
get
a
search
warrant.
he
waited
for
five
months
until
he
arrested
him.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
yes
it
does,
your
honor
because
i
was
getting
to
this
third
ground
of
mine
which
deals
with
the
urgent
emergency
situation
or
under
extreme
circumstances,
when
a
federal
officer
can
go
into
a
home
and
invade
privacy
without
the
benefit
of
the
search
warrant
and
so
far
this
court,
has
limited
these
circumstances
to
a
situation
where
an
agent
is
in
hot
pursuit
of
a
felon
and
a
felon
runs
into
a
home,
you
don't
need
a
search
warrant
to
go
in
and
get
him.
when
an
officer
is
walking
by
someone's
home
and
this
is
shot
and
a
cry
for
assistance
the
officer
doesn't
need
any
warrant
to
get
into
the
home.
i
know
of
only
five
situations,
and
that
doesn't
mean
there
aren't
any
more
where
an
officer
can
get
into
the
home
of
a
citizen.
if
he
has
an
arrest
warrant,
a
search
warrant,
if
he's
in
hot
pursuit,
if
we
have
the
urgent
emergency
situation,
or
if
he
is
invited
into
the
home.
these
five
situations
are
the
past
type
situations
and
to
this
moment
i
don't
know
of
any
other
circumstances.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
i
think
that
if
--
that
if
there
was
a
crime
to
be
committed
in
his
presence,
if
that
would
be
the
probable
cause
to
go
in
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
but
he
didn't
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
him
your
honor.
you
see,
he
didn't
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
him.
he
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
getting
evidence.
and
he
did
not
arrest
him.
he
waited
five
months
and
then
got
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor
and
if
he
had
arrested
the
defendant
at
that
time,
there
would
be
no
case
before
this
court
today.
there
would
be
no
question
about
it.
he
could
make
a
search.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that's
probably
very
true
also,
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
the
petitioner
urges
for
his
third
ground
that
this
situation
does
not
fall
within
the
emergency
situation
or
extreme
circumstances
whereby
an
officer
can
go
into
the
home
without
a
search
warrant.
my
fourth
ground
deals
with
the
classes
of
cases
which
are
considered
doubtful
situations.
in
the
mcdonald
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
think
indicated
that
when
there
is
a
doubtful
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
probable
cause
exists
that
resort
should
be
made
to
a
search
warrant
in
order
that
a
decision
of
a
magistrate
and
not
that
the
police
may
govern
as
to
when
privacy
may
be
invaded.
this
was
most
adequately
set
out
in
the
jones
and
mcdonald
cases
and
i
think
this
situation
certainly
was
not
a
situation
which
would
step
outside
of
this
particular
category.
i
urge
this
court
to
consider
that
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
should
have
been
made.
my
fifth
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
no
question
about
it.
my
fifth
ground
deals
with
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
as
the
safeguard
to
the
police
state.
the
government
has
the
right
to
use
informers
and
this
particular
question
is
not
an
issue
here
now.
but
the
government
has
argued
and
urges
that
to
outlaw
what
i
have
choose
to
call
a
sneaky
peek
method
of
getting
into
the
home
would
immunize
criminal
activity
in
the
home.
however,
the
mcdonald
case
which
had
been
relied
upon
by
the
government
at
page
27
of
their
brief
dispels
any
fears
in
this
regard.
here
it
was
said
that
the
presence
of
a
search
warrant
serves
a
high
function
absent
some
grave
emergency,
the
fourth
amendment
has
interposed
a
magistrate
between
the
citizen
and
the
police
and
this
was
not
done
to
shield
criminals
nor
to
make
the
home
a
safe
haven
for
illegal
activities.
it
was
done
so
that
an
objective
might
waive
a
need
to
invade
the
privacy
in
order
to
enforce
the
law.
the
right
of
privacy
was
deemed
too
precious
to
be
entrusted
to
the
discretion
of
those
whose
job
is
the
detection
of
crime.
and
finally,
my
sixth
ground
deals
with
the
result
of
legalizing
this
type
of
entry
by
deception.
if
the
government
seriously
contends
that
striking
down
this
kind
of
intrusion
will
immunize
crime
in
the
home
which
you
cannot
and
will
not,
we
should
hear
the
government's
response
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
next.
i
am
compelled
to
point
out
to
this
honorable
court
that
if
the
police
power
is
enlarge
to
permit
this
type
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
government,
then
the
people
of
this
great
land
innocent
or
otherwise
could
never
be
certain
that
the
postman,
the
priest,
the
rabbi
or
some
repairman
coming
into
the
home
was
not
a
government
agent
bent
on
spying
into
the
home
or
into
the
private
affairs
of
its
occupants.
just
think
of
the
great
distrust
of
our
government
this
situation
will
create.
what
will
a
father
or
a
mother
think
when
their
children
bring
home
their
friends
or
their
dates,
are
these
agents
also?
could
not
brothers
then
eye
each
other
with
suspicion?
this
then
is
the
real
danger
which
we
are
faced
unless
this
particular
doctrine
is
eliminated.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
not
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
my
point
is
that
if
we
enlarge
the
police
powers
to
this
extent,
we
open
the
door
to
this
doctrine's
invasion
into
our
privacy.
i
don't
think
as
an
innocent
person
i
wouldn't
wonder
whether
or
not
my
daughter
is
bringing
home
a
date
that
this
might
not
be
an
agent
of
the
treasury
department
perhaps
to
see
what
the
inside
of
my
house
looks
like.
i
don't
want
to
have
this
thought
in
my
mind.
i
want
to
know
that
i
am
safe
in
my
home
unless
the
government
has
a
proper
warrant
to
come
into
my
house
and
look
for
something.
a
free
people
ought
not
to
fear
or
be
suspicious
of
their
government
or
his
doings
and
to
permit
this
type
of
intrusion
will
surely
blast
open
a
front
door
of
the
home
and
destroy
the
right
of
privacy
bequeath
to
all
of
us
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution.
for
these
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
and
in
my
proudest
moment,
i
urge
this
great
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
of
mr.
lewis
and
to
continue
to
guard
all
of
our
rights
as
you
have
in
the
past
as
zealously
as
those
who
would
seek
to
encroach
upon.
thank
you.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
nothing
noble
about
the
petitioner's
approach
to
this
case.
the
main
question
here
is
whether
or
not
under
these
facts
and
especially
where
the
government
had
enough
evidence
and
time
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
failed
to
do
so,
it
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
it
gained
entry
to
his
home
by
fraud
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
evidence.
it
is
the
fraudulent
entry
that
the
fourth
amendment
shields
us
against
not
too
much
what
goes
on
in
the
house.
and
i'll
ask
the
court
in
making
its
decision
please
to
keep
this
thought
in
mind.
this
is
the
law
of
the
gouled
case
as
was
followed
in
cook,
rakes,
and
gatewood.
it's
the
fraudulent
entry
into
the
home
by
the
government
and
that
i
think
is
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
before
i
answer
your
honor
it's
not
clear
on
my
mind
as
to
how
this
government
agent
originally
got
into
the
house
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
just
investigating?
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
this
is
the
neighbor,
your
honor?
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i'm
afraid
before
i
could
fully
answer
the
question
your
honor
that
i
have
to
say
that
if
the
agent
went
there
to
investigate
about
something
that
happened
across
the
way,
he
would
not
have,
in
my
opinion
serve
probable
cause
at
the
outset,
at
the
moment
of
going
in
to
the
house
to
make
an
arrest
of
this
individual
under
those
circumstances.
i
feel
that
this
is
a
--
i
understand
i
think
your
honor's
purpose
in
asking
and
it
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
i
feel
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor
if
the
occupant
of
the
house
knew
when
he
invited
this
person
into
the
house
that
this
person
was
a
government
agent
then
he
was
dealing
with
him
at
arm's
length
and
like
in
the
lopez
case,
he
took
matters
into
his
own
hands.
he
knew
fully
what
he
was
doing
with
an
agent
of
the
government
and
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
i
could
draw
on
this.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
in
part
your
honor
but
in
this
instance,
i
respectfully
call
your
honor's
attention,
there
was
ample
time
and
ample
evidence
to
get
this
search
warrant
and
the
failure
to
do
so
under
these
circumstances
is
one
of
the
thrust
of
the
petitioner's
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
in
one
instance.
that
is
to
say
if
he
has
personal
knowledge
that
the
from
another
source,
in
this
case
from
ritchie
gold
also
his
own
personal
knowledge
because
he
made
a
phone
call
that
the
marijuana
was
in
the
house,
he
should
have
gotten
the
search
warrant.
now,
the
other
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
then
the
question
becomes
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
probable
cause.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
wouldn't
say
so,
your
honor
completely
because
you
see
in
addition
to
having
personal
knowledge
the
agent
by
making
the
phone
call,
he
also
had
information
from
ritchie
gold
and
this
particular
defendant
had
been
a
suspect
for
over
a
year
prior
to
the
time
he
went
to
the
house,
your
honor.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
even
by
extreme
circumstances,
the
agent
had
more
than
enough
information
and
probable
cause
to
get
the
search
warrant
and
i
think
his
failure
to
do
so
by
using
this
deceptive
practice
to
get
into
the
house
to
solicit
some
more
crimes
and
get
some
more
evidence
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
respect.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
to
answer
your
question,
if
all
the
narcotics
people
were
to
confine
themselves
to
a
single
dwelling
this
would
be
the
greatest
boom
to
the
government
law
enforcement
agents
because
if
the
government
points
out
in
their
brief
90%
--
that
is
prevalent
and
most
of
these
sales
takes
place
on
the
street.
they
are
scattered
out
all
over
the
place.
if
the
dope
peddlers
got
into
their
homes
all
the
federal
officers
would
have
to
do
is
to
sit
out
in
front
of
the
house
and
like
the
farmer
says
watch
the
bee
traffic
and
they
knock
off
the
whole
thing
immediately.
it
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
that
could
stop
the
narcotics
trade
if
they
can
find
their
activities
to
one
particular
place
and
we
knew
where
they
were.
this
situation
that
we're
presented
with
here
isn't
going
to
help
them
a
bit.
if
anything,
it's
certainly
going
to
harm
them.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
they
could
do
that
but
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
him
because
they
would
get
caught.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
the
lewis
case
is
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
is
violated
when
a
government
agent
gains
entrance
to
the
home
of
citizen
without
a
search
warrant
and
by
disguise
and
deception
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
a
crime
and
obtaining
evidence
to
be
used
against
him.
the
facts
briefly
are
as
follows.
on
december
3,
1964,
a
man
by
the
name
of
jimmy
the
pollack
telephoned
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
telling
him
that
a
mutual
friend
had
said
that
the
petitioner
had
some
marijuana
and
that
he,
jimmy,
wanted
to
buy
some.
the
petitioner
responded
that
the
mutual
friend
had
mentioned
jimmy
and
jimmy
thereby
procured
an
invitation
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
some
marijuana.
jimmy
the
pollack
arrived
at
the
petitioner's
home,
went
into
the
apartment,
sat
down,
they
discussed
the
price,
made
his
purchase
and
prior
to
leaving,
jimmy
the
pollack
stated
that
if
he
was
satisfied
as
to
the
quality
of
the
marijuana
that
he
would
probably
give
mr.
lewis
a
telephone
call
in
a
few
weeks
and
return
to
get
some
additional
marijuana.
several
weeks
later
on
december
17,
1964,
jimmy
the
pollack
again
telephoned
the
home
of
the
petitioner
and
stated
that
he
wanted
some
additional
marijuana.
again,
he
went
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
where
he
received
his
marijuana.
almost
five
months
later,
on
april
26,
1965,
jimmy
the
pollack
again
showed
up
at
the
petitioner's
home,
only
this
time,
he
came
with
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
mr.
lewis.
prior
to
the
trial,
the
petitioner
had
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
used
to
convict
mr.
lewis
at
the
trial
and
that
motion
was
seeking
to
suppress
the
evidence,
admissions,
and
conversations
which
the
petitioner
alleged
were
procured
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
jimmy
the
pollack
in
reality
was
mr.
edward
cass,
an
undercover
agent
for
the
narcotics
bureau
of
the
treasury
department.
he
was
--
he
was
called
to
the
witness
stand
on
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
and
was
asked
the
following
questions
and
gave
the
following
replies.
question:
at
some
time
during
your
investigation
prior
to
the
arrest
of
mr.
lewis,
did
the
defendant
mr.
lewis
become
a
suspect?
answer:
yes,
he
did.
question:
can
you
tell
us
when
it
time
that
was
mr.
cass?
answer:
yes,
sir,
in
1963.
i
bring
this
respectively
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
remind
the
court
that
the
two
purchases
which
were
made
were
made
in
december
of
1964.
the
defendant
therefore
was
a
suspect
for
over
a
year
prior
to
a
time
when
these
two
buys
were
made.
question:
on
or
about
thursday,
december
3,
1964,
did
you
communicate
by
telephone
with
the
defendant
prior
to
going
to
his
home?
answer:
yes
sir,
i
did.
question:
was
the
purpose
of
your
telephone
call
on
this
date
sir
to
inquire
about
a
purchase
of
about
a
quantity
of
marijuana?
answer:
it
was.
question:
on
said
dates,
december
3,
and
december
17,
1964,
mr.
cass,
did
you
pose
as
someone
other
than
the
federal
officer
that
you
are?
answer:
i
did.
question:
whether
or
not
you
represented
your
self
to
the
defendant
on
those
occasions,
that
you
were
jimmy
the
pollack
operating
a
bar
and
grill
in
rhode
island.
answer:
that
is
correct.
question:
when
you
went
to
the
defendant's
home
on
december
3
and
december
17,
mr.
cass,
did
you
have
a
search
warrant
for
that
purpose?
answer:
i
did
not.
question:
at
the
time
you
went
to
the
defendant's
home
on
december
3,
1964,
did
you
suspect
from
information
you
had
received
prior
thereto
or
based
on
your
own
personal
knowledge
or
otherwise
that
the
transaction
might
take
place
at
the
home
of
the
defendant
so
far
as
the
transfer
of
marijuana
is
concerned?
question:
when
you
went
to
the
home
of
the
defendant
on
december
3
and
december
17,
mr.
cass,
did
you
not
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
narcotics
from
him?
at
page
31
of
the
record,
the
fact
is
disclosed
that
one,
richard
gold
was
the
informer
who
had
put
the
agent
in
touch
with
mr.
lewis.
the
petitioner
waived
a
trial
by
jury
as
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
according
to
law
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not,
unless,
you
would
consider
the
conversations
an
admission.
that's
all
the
case
in
the
apartment.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
the
question
--
the
defense
of
entrapment
was
not
raise
at
the
trial
court.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor,
there
wasn't.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
without
a
search
warrant.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
petitioner's
argument
for
reversal
is
based
on
six
brief
grounds.
first,
the
circuit
court
in
confirming
the
convictions
relied
on
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
pasquinzo,
334
federal
2d
page
74.
this
was
a
ninth
circuit
case
where
the
agent
was
in
disguise
but
the
purchase
of
the
narcotics
took
place
in
a
drugstore
which
is
a
place
in
business
open
to
the
public.
and
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
situation
from
the
one
that
is
presented
before
the
bar
this
morning.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
would
have
no
objections
to
it,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
addition
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
sir.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct.
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
this
informer
would
be
paid
by
the
government
in
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
if
he
was
not
paid
by
the
government
but
simply
volunteered
to
do
this
by
himself
and
then
subsequently
had
a
change
of
heart
and
decided
he
would
go
to
the
government
and
say
i
know
of
a
man
who
has
committed
a
crime,
i
would
not
have
the
objection
that
i
have
here
this
morning.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
because,
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
i
will
set
forth
a
little
further
in
my
argument
precludes
the
government
either
directly
or
indirectly
through
a
paid
informer
of
gaining
entrance
to
the
house
in
this
manner
and
i
would
like
to
develop
that
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
person
who
gained
entrance
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner
was
a
narcotics
agent.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
not
a
really
a
question,
your
honor.
the
conversation
as
related
in
the
record
states
that
when
the
agent
told
the
petitioner
that
a
mutual
friend
had
indicated
that
he
had
some
for
sale,
the
petitioner
responded,
“yes,
jimmy.
he
told
me
about
you.
i
think
i
might
be
able
to
help
you”
or
words
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
the
government
has
cited
--
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no
your
honor.
oh!
excuse
me
your
honor.
from
an
office?
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
his
office.
i
maintain
that
if
mr.
lewis
has
done
this
on
a
street
or
in
some
public
place,
there
would
be
no
question
here
usually
from
my
limited
experience,
your
honor.
most
of
the
agents
will
make
their
buys
in
the
street,
in
an
agent's
automobile
or
some
public
place.
only
this
time,
the
agent
took
a
depart
himself
to
go
to
the
front
door
of
the
home
of
the
defendant
without
a
search
warrant
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
petitioner's
contention.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
he
could
have
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
if
i
may
digress
from
my
argument
for
a
moment
to
answer,
your
honor.
i
feel
in
my
heart
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
the
proposition
that
you
stated,
the
government
ought
not
to
participate
in
the
solicitation
of
crimes
in
the
obtaining
of
evidence
in
this
regard.
but
unfortunately,
in
this
particular
instance,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
purchase
took
place
in
the
home
of
the
defendant,
i
find
myself
for
the
moment
anyhow
confined
to
that
general
area.
i
truly
feel
there's
no
distinction
from
what
your
honor
has
said
but
for
the
basis
of
this
case
this
morning,
i'm
going
to
confine
it
to
the
home.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
he
goes
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
there
are
several
aspects
to
that.
that
is
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
i
think
it
goes
deeper
than
that,
your
honor.
i
think
where
this
agent
had
this
information
in
advance
and
had
already
previously
made
arrangements
to
go
to
the
home
and
make
the
purchase
that
under
those
circumstances,
he
should've
at
least
applied
for
if
not
obtain
a
search
warrant.
and
i'd
like
to
bring
that
on
a
little
further
in
my
argument.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
with
the
search
warrant,
your
honor,
having
previously
arranged
to
go
to
the
defendant's
home
to
procure
the
marijuana
and
if
your
honor
will
recall,
i
mentioned
that
he
had
information
from
an
informer.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
he
might
very
well
have
executed
the
search
warrant
and
just
said,
“where
is
it”
or
look
for
it
at
that
particular
time.
or
he
may
have
kept
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor
but
then
he
certainly
would
be
in
violation
of
the
law
in
possession
of
the
narcotics
without
the
proper
forum.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
with
all
my
heart,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor.
i
do.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
truthfully.i
think
that
it
would
be
the
same
i
think
that
is
the
line
of
reasoning
the
justice
stewart
has
suggested
to
me
this
morning.
i
must
confess
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
if
the
government
themselves
originate
and
start
the
chain
of
events
which
leads
up
to
something
like
this
where
they
obtain
evidence
in
disguise.
it's
something
this
court
has
discussed
at
great
lengths
in
many
cases
and
that's
why
i'm
forced
this
morning
to
try
if
possible
to
keep
myself
in
the
home
because
if
i
get
outside
the
home,
i'm
going
to
be
(inaudible)
a
little
bit.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
there
have
been
cases
which
you
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
there
have
been
some
that
have
been
close,
your
honor,
if
i
may
use
the
term.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
the
cook
versus
the
united
states
was
a
situation
where
an
agent
was
going
--
an
informer
was
going
to
buy
some
bootleg
whiskey
and
they
put
the
agent
in
the
trunk
of
the
automobile
while
the
other
one
drove
the
car
into
the
landowner's
--
inside
his
fence
and
the
court
held
that
in
following
gouled,
that
this
was
a
type
of
a
fraudulent
entry
into
the
home.
it's
the
entry
into
the
home
procured
by
fraud
if
the
petitioner
appeals
that
the
petitioner
appeals.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
sir.
but
the
man
who
was
driving
the
car
was.
you
see,
the
two
of
them
were
working
together.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
suppose
you
do.
but
the
--
the
government
has
in
their
brief
alluded
to
the
lopez
case
in
opposition
to
the
petitioner's
position.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lopez
case,
the
government
agent
from
internal
revenue
went
to
the
premises
of
the
defendant
asked
the
government
agent
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
operation
of
the
café
made
it
subject
to
the
cabaret
tax
and
why
he
was
there
in
his
official
capacity,
the
defendant
tried
to
bribe
him
and
that
was
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted.
my
second
ground
deals
with
the
prior
law
in
this
particular
point
and
i
feel
that
the
lewis
case
is
in
line
with
the
gouled
the
rakes
case
which
is
a
massachusetts
case
incidentally
where
a
supervisor
from
the
alcohol
tax
division
went
out
to
see
his
tenant
farmer
and
said,
“hi!
the
boss
had
sent
me
down
to
fix
this
still.”
whereupon,
the
defendant
said,
“alright,
here
are
the
keys,
it's
in
that
barn
over
there.”
this
type
of
a
deceptive
practice
and
the
rakes
case
also
relied
on
gouled.
the
cook
case
was
the
one
i
described
with
the
agent
in
the
trunk
and
in
gatewood
versus
the
united
states,
209
f.2d
where
the
officers
weren't
necessarily
invited
to
the
premises
but
they
did
knock
outside
the
door
of
the
defendants
and
when
asked
who's
there,
the
agents
replied,
“western
union”
and
of
course
gained
entrance
by
that
type
of
a
deceptive
practice.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
on
page
19
of
their
brief
states
the
shield
which
the
fourth
amendment
directs
around
the
home
is
designed
to
keep
out
unwanted
intruders
and
if
my
history
serves
me
correctly,
your
honor,
in
the
beginning
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
drafted,
the
unwarranted
intruder
at
that
time
was
government
and
i
submit
if
the
government
disguises
itself,
it's
still
the
unwanted
intruder
so
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned.
the
disguise
will
not
change
the
identity
of
the
government.
my
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
he
had
called.
he
telephoned
the
home
of
petitioner
first,
your
honor
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
buy
some
marijuana
and
on
the
strength
of
that,
he
was
invited
over
to
the
defendant's
petitioner's
home.
my
third
ground
for
reversal
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
if
the
officer
had
told
him
he
was
an
officer,
your
honor,
i'm
quite
sure,
he
wouldn't
have
been
invited.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
there
have
been
no
sale,
no
transaction
and
probably
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor
on
that
particular
point.
i
have
covered
that
in
the
remaining
section
of
my
argument
and
i
think
that
your
honor
will
have
an
answer
to
that.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
individuals
i
think
in
their
home
and
that
protection
must
be
equally
extended
to
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty.
i
can't
determine
in
my
own
mind
how
we
could
divide
and
say
in
one
instance
we
will
give
the
homeowner
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
in
another
instance
because
he's
a
criminal
or
he's
up
to
some
evil
deed,
we
won't
give
it
to
him.
now,
he's
going
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor,
but
he
is
an
officer
of
the
government.
he
had
ample
opportunity
and
time
to
get
a
search
warrant.
he
waited
for
five
months
until
he
arrested
him.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
yes
it
does,
your
honor
because
i
was
getting
to
this
third
ground
of
mine
which
deals
with
the
urgent
emergency
situation
or
under
extreme
circumstances,
when
a
federal
officer
can
go
into
a
home
and
invade
privacy
without
the
benefit
of
the
search
warrant
and
so
far
this
court,
has
limited
these
circumstances
to
a
situation
where
an
agent
is
in
hot
pursuit
of
a
felon
and
a
felon
runs
into
a
home,
you
don't
need
a
search
warrant
to
go
in
and
get
him.
when
an
officer
is
walking
by
someone's
home
and
this
is
shot
and
a
cry
for
assistance
the
officer
doesn't
need
any
warrant
to
get
into
the
home.
i
know
of
only
five
situations,
and
that
doesn't
mean
there
aren't
any
more
where
an
officer
can
get
into
the
home
of
a
citizen.
if
he
has
an
arrest
warrant,
a
search
warrant,
if
he's
in
hot
pursuit,
if
we
have
the
urgent
emergency
situation,
or
if
he
is
invited
into
the
home.
these
five
situations
are
the
past
type
situations
and
to
this
moment
i
don't
know
of
any
other
circumstances.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
i
think
that
if
--
that
if
there
was
a
crime
to
be
committed
in
his
presence,
if
that
would
be
the
probable
cause
to
go
in
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
but
he
didn't
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
him
your
honor.
you
see,
he
didn't
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
him.
he
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
getting
evidence.
and
he
did
not
arrest
him.
he
waited
five
months
and
then
got
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor
and
if
he
had
arrested
the
defendant
at
that
time,
there
would
be
no
case
before
this
court
today.
there
would
be
no
question
about
it.
he
could
make
a
search.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that's
probably
very
true
also,
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
the
petitioner
urges
for
his
third
ground
that
this
situation
does
not
fall
within
the
emergency
situation
or
extreme
circumstances
whereby
an
officer
can
go
into
the
home
without
a
search
warrant.
my
fourth
ground
deals
with
the
classes
of
cases
which
are
considered
doubtful
situations.
in
the
mcdonald
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
think
indicated
that
when
there
is
a
doubtful
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
probable
cause
exists
that
resort
should
be
made
to
a
search
warrant
in
order
that
a
decision
of
a
magistrate
and
not
that
the
police
may
govern
as
to
when
privacy
may
be
invaded.
this
was
most
adequately
set
out
in
the
jones
and
mcdonald
cases
and
i
think
this
situation
certainly
was
not
a
situation
which
would
step
outside
of
this
particular
category.
i
urge
this
court
to
consider
that
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
should
have
been
made.
my
fifth
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
no
question
about
it.
my
fifth
ground
deals
with
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
as
the
safeguard
to
the
police
state.
the
government
has
the
right
to
use
informers
and
this
particular
question
is
not
an
issue
here
now.
but
the
government
has
argued
and
urges
that
to
outlaw
what
i
have
choose
to
call
a
sneaky
peek
method
of
getting
into
the
home
would
immunize
criminal
activity
in
the
home.
however,
the
mcdonald
case
which
had
been
relied
upon
by
the
government
at
page
27
of
their
brief
dispels
any
fears
in
this
regard.
here
it
was
said
that
the
presence
of
a
search
warrant
serves
a
high
function
absent
some
grave
emergency,
the
fourth
amendment
has
interposed
a
magistrate
between
the
citizen
and
the
police
and
this
was
not
done
to
shield
criminals
nor
to
make
the
home
a
safe
haven
for
illegal
activities.
it
was
done
so
that
an
objective
might
waive
a
need
to
invade
the
privacy
in
order
to
enforce
the
law.
the
right
of
privacy
was
deemed
too
precious
to
be
entrusted
to
the
discretion
of
those
whose
job
is
the
detection
of
crime.
and
finally,
my
sixth
ground
deals
with
the
result
of
legalizing
this
type
of
entry
by
deception.
if
the
government
seriously
contends
that
striking
down
this
kind
of
intrusion
will
immunize
crime
in
the
home
which
you
cannot
and
will
not,
we
should
hear
the
government's
response
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
next.
i
am
compelled
to
point
out
to
this
honorable
court
that
if
the
police
power
is
enlarge
to
permit
this
type
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
government,
then
the
people
of
this
great
land
innocent
or
otherwise
could
never
be
certain
that
the
postman,
the
priest,
the
rabbi
or
some
repairman
coming
into
the
home
was
not
a
government
agent
bent
on
spying
into
the
home
or
into
the
private
affairs
of
its
occupants.
just
think
of
the
great
distrust
of
our
government
this
situation
will
create.
what
will
a
father
or
a
mother
think
when
their
children
bring
home
their
friends
or
their
dates,
are
these
agents
also?
could
not
brothers
then
eye
each
other
with
suspicion?
this
then
is
the
real
danger
which
we
are
faced
unless
this
particular
doctrine
is
eliminated.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
that
is
not
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
my
point
is
that
if
we
enlarge
the
police
powers
to
this
extent,
we
open
the
door
to
this
doctrine's
invasion
into
our
privacy.
i
don't
think
as
an
innocent
person
i
wouldn't
wonder
whether
or
not
my
daughter
is
bringing
home
a
date
that
this
might
not
be
an
agent
of
the
treasury
department
perhaps
to
see
what
the
inside
of
my
house
looks
like.
i
don't
want
to
have
this
thought
in
my
mind.
i
want
to
know
that
i
am
safe
in
my
home
unless
the
government
has
a
proper
warrant
to
come
into
my
house
and
look
for
something.
a
free
people
ought
not
to
fear
or
be
suspicious
of
their
government
or
his
doings
and
to
permit
this
type
of
intrusion
will
surely
blast
open
a
front
door
of
the
home
and
destroy
the
right
of
privacy
bequeath
to
all
of
us
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution.
for
these
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
and
in
my
proudest
moment,
i
urge
this
great
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
of
mr.
lewis
and
to
continue
to
guard
all
of
our
rights
as
you
have
in
the
past
as
zealously
as
those
who
would
seek
to
encroach
upon.
thank
you.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
nothing
noble
about
the
petitioner's
approach
to
this
case.
the
main
question
here
is
whether
or
not
under
these
facts
and
especially
where
the
government
had
enough
evidence
and
time
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
failed
to
do
so,
it
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
it
gained
entry
to
his
home
by
fraud
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
evidence.
it
is
the
fraudulent
entry
that
the
fourth
amendment
shields
us
against
not
too
much
what
goes
on
in
the
house.
and
i'll
ask
the
court
in
making
its
decision
please
to
keep
this
thought
in
mind.
this
is
the
law
of
the
gouled
case
as
was
followed
in
cook,
rakes,
and
gatewood.
it's
the
fraudulent
entry
into
the
home
by
the
government
and
that
i
think
is
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
before
i
answer
your
honor
it's
not
clear
on
my
mind
as
to
how
this
government
agent
originally
got
into
the
house
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
just
investigating?
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
this
is
the
neighbor,
your
honor?
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i'm
afraid
before
i
could
fully
answer
the
question
your
honor
that
i
have
to
say
that
if
the
agent
went
there
to
investigate
about
something
that
happened
across
the
way,
he
would
not
have,
in
my
opinion
serve
probable
cause
at
the
outset,
at
the
moment
of
going
in
to
the
house
to
make
an
arrest
of
this
individual
under
those
circumstances.
i
feel
that
this
is
a
--
i
understand
i
think
your
honor's
purpose
in
asking
and
it
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
i
feel
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor
if
the
occupant
of
the
house
knew
when
he
invited
this
person
into
the
house
that
this
person
was
a
government
agent
then
he
was
dealing
with
him
at
arm's
length
and
like
in
the
lopez
case,
he
took
matters
into
his
own
hands.
he
knew
fully
what
he
was
doing
with
an
agent
of
the
government
and
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
i
could
draw
on
this.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
in
part
your
honor
but
in
this
instance,
i
respectfully
call
your
honor's
attention,
there
was
ample
time
and
ample
evidence
to
get
this
search
warrant
and
the
failure
to
do
so
under
these
circumstances
is
one
of
the
thrust
of
the
petitioner's
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
in
one
instance.
that
is
to
say
if
he
has
personal
knowledge
that
the
from
another
source,
in
this
case
from
ritchie
gold
also
his
own
personal
knowledge
because
he
made
a
phone
call
that
the
marijuana
was
in
the
house,
he
should
have
gotten
the
search
warrant.
now,
the
other
--
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
well,
then
the
question
becomes
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
probable
cause.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
i
wouldn't
say
so,
your
honor
completely
because
you
see
in
addition
to
having
personal
knowledge
the
agent
by
making
the
phone
call,
he
also
had
information
from
ritchie
gold
and
this
particular
defendant
had
been
a
suspect
for
over
a
year
prior
to
the
time
he
went
to
the
house,
your
honor.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
even
by
extreme
circumstances,
the
agent
had
more
than
enough
information
and
probable
cause
to
get
the
search
warrant
and
i
think
his
failure
to
do
so
by
using
this
deceptive
practice
to
get
into
the
house
to
solicit
some
more
crimes
and
get
some
more
evidence
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
respect.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
to
answer
your
question,
if
all
the
narcotics
people
were
to
confine
themselves
to
a
single
dwelling
this
would
be
the
greatest
boom
to
the
government
law
enforcement
agents
because
if
the
government
points
out
in
their
brief
90%
--
that
is
prevalent
and
most
of
these
sales
takes
place
on
the
street.
they
are
scattered
out
all
over
the
place.
if
the
dope
peddlers
got
into
their
homes
all
the
federal
officers
would
have
to
do
is
to
sit
out
in
front
of
the
house
and
like
the
farmer
says
watch
the
bee
traffic
and
they
knock
off
the
whole
thing
immediately.
it
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
that
could
stop
the
narcotics
trade
if
they
can
find
their
activities
to
one
particular
place
and
we
knew
where
they
were.
this
situation
that
we're
presented
with
here
isn't
going
to
help
them
a
bit.
if
anything,
it's
certainly
going
to
harm
them.
mr.
s.
myron
klarfeld
they
could
do
that
but
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
him
because
they
would
get
caught.
