mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
i
think
the
court
has
the
facts
well
in
mind.
let
me
comment
very
briefly
in
relation
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier
as
to
whether
there
is
any
question
of
entrapment.
counsel
correctly
pointed
out
to
your
honors
that
no
such
dissents
was
made
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
on
the
facts
of
records
here,
none
could
have
been
advanced.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
agent
had
leverage,
exercise
any
pressures,
psychological
or
otherwise
or
indeed
a
case
in
which
he
importuned
the
petitioner
to
engage
in
the
transaction.
there
was
a
simple
telephone
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
the
agent
said
that
he's
heard
the
petitioner
had
marijuana
to
sell.
petitioner
promptly
indicated
that
he
was
disposed
to
deal.
there
is
not
only
that
indication
of
his
disposition
to
engage
in
the
transaction
but
the
fact
later
develops
that
he
had
the
stock
on
hand,
that
he
had
marijuana
in
his
home,
confirmed
the
fact
that
he
was
a
person
who
was
already
engaged
in
a
course
of
criminal
conduct.
so
far
as
i
know,
no
court
has
ever
considered
that
an
undercover
agent,
that
is
to
say
one
who
has
concealed
his
identity
as
an
agent
is
disabled
by
the
constitution
or
by
any
principle
of
law
from
testifying
to
criminal
acts
or
admission
which
occur
in
his
presence
simple
because
he
concealed
his
true
identity
and
because
the
other
party
would
not
have
done
what
he
did
if
that
identity
have
been
disclosed.
of
course
undercover
agents
and
also
accomplices
who
later
turn
state's
evidence
have
been
used
in
literally
thousands
of
cases
from
the
time
that
our
courts
first
began
to
operate.
indeed
the
existence
of
informer
statutes
in
this
country
goes
back
to
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states,
the
same
congress
which
enacted
the
bill
of
rights.
although
petitioner
makes
his
argument
primarily
and
perhaps
almost
exclusively
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
in
this
instance,
the
transaction
took
place
in
the
home.
i'd
like
first
for
a
few
minutes
to
examine
the
question
quite
apart
from
the
home
on
the
assumption
for
the
moment
that
the
transaction
had
taken
place
somewhere
else
say
in
the
alley
in
back
of
the
house.
now,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
fifth
amendment
furnishes
no
guarantee
and
i
speak
of
the
fifth
as
well
as
of
the
fourth
that
a
person
to
whom
i
voluntarily
speak
and
make
an
incriminating
admission
or
whose
presence
i
commit
an
offense
will
respect
the
confidence
that
i
place
in
him
by
performing
that
act
or
engaging
in
that
conversation.
the
risk
as
the
person
to
whom
the
words
are
spoken
is
an
informer
as
justice
brennan
put
it
in
his
lopez
opinion
is
the
kind
of
risk
which
is
inherent
in
any
human
society,
the
kind
of
risk
we
take
whenever
we
speak.
and
by
the
same
token,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
thought
or
a
spoken
word
is
not
seized
in
the
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
one
of
the
positions
of
this
petitioner
voluntarily
engages
in
a
face
to
face
conversation
and
engages
in
a
criminal
transaction.
in
such
circumstances,
there
is
no
invasion
of
the
person
of
the
petitioner.
in
such
circumstances,
what
he
chooses
to
say
and
what
he
chooses
to
do
is
simply
a
means
of
furthering
the
criminal
enterprises
in
which
he
chooses
to
engage.
in
such
circumstances,
i
would
say
he
has
parted
with
no
secret
for
he
acted
in
the
agent's
presence
precisely
as
he
would
have
in
the
presence
of
any
customer.
now,
petitioner's
argument
seems
to
acknowledge
implicitly
what
i've
argued
thus
far
but
he
says
this
case
is
different
from
the
case
which
takes
place
in
the
--
a
transaction
which
takes
place
in
the
alley
or
in
the
parking
lot
or
in
the
restaurant
or
in
the
bar
because
it
took
place
at
petitioner's
residence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
spoke
briefly
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
then
said
that
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
better
fourth
amendment
contention.
if
the
statement
is
a
voluntary
one
not
in
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment,
then
it
seems
to
me
also
it
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
seized
from
him
in
the
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
was
arguing
that
one
who
makes
a
statement
relating
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
in
the
course
of
a
face
to
face
conversation,
intending
that
the
words
he
speaks
and
the
acts
he
commits
be
heard
and
known
to
the
other
party
is
not
being
compelled
to
make
an
admission
in
the
sense
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
wasn't
speaking
of
it
in
terms
of
a
waiver.
i
was
saying
there
was
no
compulsion
in
such
a
case.
one
may
in
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
an
element
of
deception
in
every
conversation
in
which
an
undercover
agent
takes
place.
this
court
has
never
regarded
such
deception
as
constituting
compulsory
self-incrimination.
it
has
said
rather
that
one
takes
the
risk
when
one
engages
voluntarily
in
a
crime
knowing
that
he
is
committing
a
criminal
act
that
the
person
in
whose
presence
that
act
is
committed
or
whose
presence
the
admissions
are
made
will
not
disclose
it.
this
is
a
case
involving
not
invasion
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment,
but
a
case
involving
a
breach
of
confidence
and
that
is
not
lawfully
protected.
that
isn't
same
as
harris.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
am
stating
a
position
and
i
think
i
am
supported
by
every
case
the
court
has
ever
decided
on
this
point.
let
me
refer
to
a
few
of
the
cases
which
clearly
place
this
on
issue.
let
me
begin
with
on
lee,
in
the
on
lee
case,
the
friend
who
was
in
fact
an
agent
came
on
to
the
premises.
that
man
was
named
chin
poy
and
outside
of
course,
there
was
another
agent,
unbeknownst
to
the
owner
of
the
premises
who
was
listening
in
through
a
device.
this
court
divided
on
the
question
whether
the
outside
agent
who
had
intruded
through
the
electronic
device
could
testify
but
no
member
of
this
court
had
any
doubt
that
chin
poy,
the
government
agent
who
entered
the
premises
could
have
testified
had
he
been
called.
reference
was
made
the
other
day
to
judge
frank's
dissent
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
on
lee
case
and
to
the
fact
that
judge
frank
had
emphasized
the
protection
to
which
the
person
is
entitled
in
his
home.
now
what
was
not
mentioned
about
the
judge
frank's
dissent
in
the
on
lee
case
was
that
judge
frank
was
also
quite
clear
that
chin
poy
could
have
testified
in
this
case
and
indeed
he
said
that
the
constitution
provides
no
safeguard
against
errors
in
judgment
as
to
the
character
of
persons
whom
i
admit
into
my
home.
this
court
then
a
few
years
after
had
the
trupiano
case
before
it.
there
was
a
case
in
which
a
government
agent
secured
employment
as
the
so-called
mash
man
and
went
to
work
in
an
illegal
still
which
was
located
on
a
private
farm.
the
detailed
information
which
that
agent
obtained
was
relayed
to
other
agents
on
the
basis
of
which
they
obtained
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
those
operating
the
still.
and
though
there
was
division
in
the
court
on
a
point
which
is
not
relevant
here,
the
court
had
no
doubt
in
that
case,
all
of
the
members
of
the
court,
that
the
valid
--
that
the
arrest
warrant
had
been
validly
obtained.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
was
not.
the
question
on
which
the
court
divided
was
whether
the
ancillary
search
was
within
proper
confines
or
extended
too
far,
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest
and
finally
i
would
mention
the
lopez
case
itself
which
has
been
discussed
several
times
in
these
three
cases.
in
the
lopez
case,
a
separate
argument
was
made
that
quite
apart
from
the
use
of
the
electronic
device.
there
had
been
a
deception
when
the
agent
went
into
the
office
of
mr.
lopez
and
the
deception
it
was
charged
was
that
the
agent
had
indicated
a
willingness
to
accept
the
bribe
and
had
he
not
indicated
that
willingness,
he
wouldn't
have
been
admitted
and
the
man
wouldn't
have
put
some
money
on
the
table.
and
the
court
and
i
think
this
is
true
of
all
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
refused
to
accept
that
contention.
it
was
rejected
as
shortly
in
the
dissenting
opinion
as
in
the
court's
opinion.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
mr.
justice
brennan
emphasized
in
his
dissent
that
there
is
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
use
of
an
undercover
agent
and
that
the
risk
that
a
person
with
whom
i
deal
may
be
an
informer
or
may
turn
out
to
be
an
informer
later
or
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
he
is
not
what
he
pretends
to
be
is
a
risk-inherent
in
human
society.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
if
it
had
been,
none
was
in
this
case
your
honor
i
understand.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
view
that
as
a
question
quite
separate
your
honor
from
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
entry
and
as
to
the
admissibility
of
such
a
recording,
the
government
does
indeed
in
those
cases
where
the
issue
arises
rely
on
the
lopez
decision
as
was
made
there
to
your
honor's
in
the
osborne
case
recently
argued.
i
should
mention
the
gouled
case
upon
which
petitioner
principally
relies
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
clearly
points
up
an
important
distinction.
gouled
as
we
see
it
is
a
quite
different
kind
of
case.
there
the
government
employed
an
agent
who
was
a
friend
of
gouled.
it
was
seeking
information
about
gouled
on
charges
of
fraud.
the
agent
went
to
gouled's
offices
ostensibly
to
pay
a
friendly
call
upon
him.
the
agent
was
admitted.
he
engaged
in
conversation
with
gouled
and
thereafter
gouled
absented
himself
from
the
office.
unbeknownst
to
gouled
and
without
his
consent,
the
agent
then
went
through
his
desk
drawers,
took
some
papers
out,
incriminating
papers
and
pirated
them
away
these
were
subsequently
offered
in
evidence.
now,
it
was
in
that
context
the
agent
doing
secretly
and
without
the
owner's
knowledge
something
to
which
the
owner
of
course
did
not
consented
that
the
court
concluded
that
there
had
been
an
invasion
of
the
papers
owned
by
the
person
who
occupied
those
premises.
it
was
in
that
context
that
this
court
said
that
regardless
of
the
mode
of
entry
the
taking
of
the
private
papers
was
unconsented
to
and
was
unknown
to
the
owner
of
the
premises
and
constituted
an
invasion
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
now,
in
this
case
of
course,
we
have
situation
in
which
the
agent
did
nothing
which
was
not
known
to
the
owner
of
the
premises.
he
was
the
intended
listener
when
the
statements
were
made.
he
was
the
intended
recipient
when
the
marijuana
was
passed.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
breadth
and
the
sweep
of
the
rule
for
which
petitioner
is
here
contending.
i've
indicated
earlier
that
it
is
a
completely
noble
contention.
to
my
knowledge
it
has
no
support
not
only
in
a
decision
of
the
court
that
has
no
support
so
far
as
i
know
in
any
opinion
of
the
single
justice
or
judge
but
not
only
is
it
a
noble
contention
but
i
would
like
to
stress
what
is
i
suppose
already
obvious.
that
if
such
a
rule
were
accepted
it
would
seem
to
me
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
no
informant
or
accomplices
or
undercover
agents
could
be
used
and
that
i
think
would
indeed
be
a
sweeping
and
unprecedented
step,
one
which
we
think
finds
no
justification
either
in
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
i
think
the
court
has
the
facts
well
in
mind.
let
me
comment
very
briefly
in
relation
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier
as
to
whether
there
is
any
question
of
entrapment.
counsel
correctly
pointed
out
to
your
honors
that
no
such
dissents
was
made
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
on
the
facts
of
records
here,
none
could
have
been
advanced.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
agent
had
leverage,
exercise
any
pressures,
psychological
or
otherwise
or
indeed
a
case
in
which
he
importuned
the
petitioner
to
engage
in
the
transaction.
there
was
a
simple
telephone
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
the
agent
said
that
he's
heard
the
petitioner
had
marijuana
to
sell.
petitioner
promptly
indicated
that
he
was
disposed
to
deal.
there
is
not
only
that
indication
of
his
disposition
to
engage
in
the
transaction
but
the
fact
later
develops
that
he
had
the
stock
on
hand,
that
he
had
marijuana
in
his
home,
confirmed
the
fact
that
he
was
a
person
who
was
already
engaged
in
a
course
of
criminal
conduct.
so
far
as
i
know,
no
court
has
ever
considered
that
an
undercover
agent,
that
is
to
say
one
who
has

an

by
any

from

to
criminal
acts
or
admission
which
occur
in
his

simple
because
he
concealed
his
true
identity
and
because
the
other
party
would
not
have
done
what
he
did
if
that
identity
have
been
disclosed.
of
course
undercover
agents
and
also
accomplices
who
later
turn
state's
evidence
have
been
used
in
literally
thousands
of
cases
from
the

that
our

presence
of
any
customer.
now,
petitioner's
argument
seems
to
acknowledge
implicitly
what
i've
argued
thus
far
but
he
says
this
case
is
different
from
the
case
which
takes
place
in
the
--
a
transaction
which
takes
place
in
the
alley
or
in
the
parking
lot
or
in
the
restaurant
or
in
the
bar
because
it
took
place
at
petitioner's
residence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
spoke
briefly
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
then
said
that
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
better
fourth
amendment
contention.
if
the
statement
is
a
voluntary
one
not
in
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment,
then
it
seems
to
me
also
it
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
seized
from
him
in
the
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
was
arguing
that
one
who
makes
a
statement
relating
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
in
the
course
of
a
face
to
face
conversation,
intending
that
the
words
he
speaks
and
the
acts
he
commits
be
heard
and
known
to
the
other
party
is
not
being
compelled
to
make
an
admission
in
the
sense
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
wasn't
speaking
of
it
in
terms
of
a
waiver.
i
was
saying
there
was
no
compulsion
in
such
a
case.
one
may
in
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
an
element
of
deception
in
every
conversation
in
which
an
undercover
agent
takes
place.
this
court
has
never
regarded
such
deception
as
constituting
compulsory
self-incrimination.
it
has
said
rather
that
one
takes
the
risk
when
one
engages
voluntarily
in
a
crime
knowing
that
he
is
committing
a
criminal
act
that
the
person
in
whose
presence
that
act
is
committed
or
whose
presence
the
admissions
are
made
will
not
disclose
it.
this
is
a
case
involving
not
invasion
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment,
but
a
case
involving
a
breach
of
confidence
and
that
is
not
lawfully
protected.
that
isn't
same
as
harris.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
am
stating
a
position
and
i
think
i
am
supported
by
every
case
the
court
has
ever
decided
on
this
point.
let
me
refer
to
a
few
of
the
cases
which
clearly
place
this
on
issue.
let
me
begin
with
on
lee,
in
the
on
lee
case,
the
friend
who
was
in
fact
an
agent
came
on
to
the
premises.
that
man
was
named
chin
poy
and
outside
of
course,
there
was
another
agent,
unbeknownst
to
the
owner
of
the
premises
who
was
listening
in
through
a
device.
this
court
divided
on
the
question
whether
the
outside
agent
who
had
intruded
through
the
electronic
device
could
testify
but
no
member
of
this
court
had
any
doubt
that
chin
poy,
the
government
agent
who
entered
the
premises
could
have
testified
had
he
been
called.
reference
was
made
the
other
day
to
judge
frank's
dissent
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
on
lee
case
and
to
the
fact
that
judge
frank
had
emphasized
the
protection
to
which
the
person
is
entitled
in
his
home.
now
what
was
not
mentioned
about
the
judge
frank's
dissent
in
the
on
lee
case
was
that
judge
frank
was
also
quite
clear
that
chin
poy
could
have
testified
in
this
case
and
indeed
he
said
that
the
constitution
provides
no
safeguard
against
errors
in
judgment
as
to
the
character
of
persons
whom
i
admit
into
my
home.
this
court
then
a
few
years
after
had
the
trupiano
case
before
it.
there
was
a
case
in
which
a
government
agent
secured
employment
as
the
so-called
mash
man
and
went
to
work
in
an
illegal
still
which
was
located
on
a
private
farm.
the
detailed
information
which
that
agent
obtained
was
relayed
to
other
agents
on
the
basis
of
which
they
obtained
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
those
operating
the
still.
and
though
there
was
division
in
the
court
on
a
point
which
is
not
relevant
here,
the
court
had
no
doubt
in
that
case,
all
of
the
members
of
the
court,
that
the
valid
--
that
the
arrest
warrant
had
been
validly
obtained.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
was
not.
the
question
on
which
the
court
divided
was
whether
the
ancillary
search
was
within
proper
confines
or
extended
too
far,
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest
and
finally
i
would
mention
the
lopez
case
itself
which
has
been
discussed
several
times
in
these
three
cases.
in
the
lopez
case,
a
separate
argument
was
made
that
quite
apart
from
the
use
of
the
electronic
device.
there
had
been
a
deception
when
the
agent
went
into
the
office
of
mr.
lopez
and
the
deception
it
was
charged
was
that
the
agent
had
indicated
a
willingness
to
accept
the
bribe
and
had
he
not
indicated
that
willingness,
he
wouldn't
have
been
admitted
and
the
man
wouldn't
have
put
some
money
on
the
table.
and
the
court
and
i
think
this
is
true
of
all
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
refused
to
accept
that
contention.
it
was
rejected
as
shortly
in
the
dissenting
opinion
as
in
the
court's
opinion.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
mr.
justice
brennan
emphasized
in
his
dissent
that
there
is
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
use
of
an
undercover
agent
and
that
the
risk
that
a
person
with
whom
i
deal
may
be
an
informer
or
may
turn
out
to
be
an
informer
later
or
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
he
is
not
what
he
pretends
to
be
is
a
risk-inherent
in
human
society.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
if
it
had
been,
none
was
in
this
case
your
honor
i
understand.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
view
that
as
a
question
quite
separate
your
honor
from
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
entry
and
as
to
the
admissibility
of
such
a
recording,
the
government
does
indeed
in
those
cases
where
the
issue
arises
rely
on
the
lopez
decision
as
was
made
there
to
your
honor's
in
the
osborne
case
recently
argued.
i
should
mention
the
gouled
case
upon
which
petitioner
principally
relies
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
clearly
points
up
an
important
distinction.
gouled
as
we
see
it
is
a
quite
different
kind
of
case.
there
the
government
employed
an
agent
who
was
a
friend
of
gouled.
it
was
seeking
information
about
gouled
on
charges
of
fraud.
the
agent
went
to
gouled's
offices
ostensibly
to
pay
a
friendly
call
upon
him.
the
agent
was
admitted.
he
engaged
in
conversation
with
gouled
and
thereafter
gouled
absented
himself
from
the
office.
unbeknownst
to
gouled
and
without
his
consent,
the
agent
then
went
through
his
desk
drawers,
took
some
papers
out,
incriminating
papers
and
pirated
them
away
these
were
subsequently
offered
in
evidence.
now,
it
was
in
that
context
the
agent
doing
secretly
and
without
the
owner's
knowledge
something
to
which
the
owner
of
course
did
not
consented
that
the
court
concluded
that
there
had
been
an
invasion
of
the
papers
owned
by
the
person
who
occupied
those
premises.
it
was
in
that
context
that
this
court
said
that
regardless
of
the
mode
of
entry
the
taking
of
the
private
papers
was
unconsented
to
and
was
unknown
to
the
owner
of
the
premises
and
constituted
an
invasion
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
now,
in
this
case
of
course,
we
have
situation
in
which
the
agent
did
nothing
which
was
not
known
to
the
owner
of
the
premises.
he
was
the
intended
listener
when
the
statements
were
made.
he
was
the
intended
recipient
when
the
marijuana
was
passed.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
breadth
and
the
sweep
of
the
rule
for
which
petitioner
is
here
contending.
i've
indicated
earlier
that
it
is
a
completely
noble
contention.
to
my
knowledge
it
has
no
support
not
only
in
a
decision
of
the
court
that
has
no
support
so
far
as
i
know
in
any
opinion
of
the
single
justice
or
judge
but
not
only
is
it
a
noble
contention
but
i
would
like
to
stress
what
is
i
suppose
already
obvious.
that
if
such
a
rule
were
accepted
it
would
seem
to
me
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
no
informant
or
accomplices
or
undercover
agents
could
be
used
and
that
i
think
would
indeed
be
a
sweeping
and
unprecedented
step,
one
which
we
think
finds
no
justification
either
in
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
court.
