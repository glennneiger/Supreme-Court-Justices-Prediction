what
should
they
have
done

yes,

incidentally,
i
gather
your
proposition
is,
that
even
though
the
homeowner
whether
deceived
or
not
has
the
government
agent
come
in
for
the
purpose
of
a
homeowner
committing
a
crime
namely
making
a
sale,
for
the
purpose
even
so

do
you
think
the

the

it
protects
the

the

come
in,
would
he?
justice
