justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
your
distinction
because
presumably
on
the
street,
somebody
in
the
position
of
mr.
lewis
would
have
the
narcotics
hidden
on
his
person
car,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
why
wouldn't
it
be
--
if
the
fourth
amendment
is
applicable
at
all,
why
wouldn't
it
be
equally
applicable
to
something
concealed
on
the
defendant's
person?
after
all,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
us
all
in
our
persons,
houses,
and
effects.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
the
reason
i
don't
understand
your
distinction.
in
other
words,
if
by
deception,
a
government
agent
should
induce
somebody
in
the
petitioner's
status
to
produce
narcotics
from
a
concealed
place
on
this
person
i
should
think
it's
precisely
the
same
fourth
amendment
issue
would
be
present
as
is
present
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
so
--
what's
so
wrong
if
my
daughter
brings
home
a
friend
and
i
sell
him
marijuana,
shouldn't
i
--
shouldn't
i
--
now,
what's
so
bad
about
that
if
he
goes
and
tell
the
police?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
mr.
spritzer
you're
not
talking
about
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
i
misunderstood
you
entirely.
justice

stewart
i
don't
