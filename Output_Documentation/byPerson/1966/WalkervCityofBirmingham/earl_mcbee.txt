mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
suggestion
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
doctrine
of
alabama
that
is
the
principles
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
relating
to
the
mine
workers
doctrine
relates
back
to
the
very
date
that
this
court
decided
that
case.
in
that
particular
--
at
that
particular
time
there
was
then
pending
in
the
alabama
courts
the
case
of
hecker,
greenwood
versus
hecker,
hecker
versus
greenwood,
and
there
was
also
pending
in
that
at
that
time
the
hotel
restaurant
employees
association
versus
greenwood.
in
that
case,
the
hecker
had
--
and
others
had
been
convicted
of
several
contempt.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
since
the
picketing
and
the
actual
strike
was
no
manners
for
a
lawful
purpose
and
was
legally
conducted,
that
it
did
involve
first
amendment
freedoms
of
assembly
and
speech.
and
that
therefore,
the
court,
the
lower
court
was
erroneous
in
reading
the
injunction.
they
dissolved
the
injunction.
they
then,
using
the
united
mine
workers
case
as
the
background,
determined
that
the
several
contempt
convictions
were
required
to
fall.
but
however,
the
closing
paragraph
of
the
opinion
was
that
in
view
of
the
united
mine
workers
case,
the
right
of
the
greenwoods
or
the
state
to
proceed
in
criminal
contempt
was
not
in
anyway
impaired
by
that
decision.
we
have
read
since
the
--
a
matter
of
the
city
of
fairfield
case
has
been
brought
up,
we
have
read
that
case
again.
and
we
do
not
find
that
that
case
in
anyway
militates
against
the
doctrine
that
we
have
said
in
our
briefs
as
applied
by
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
more
convinced
and
we
would
invite
the
court
to
read
the
case,
nor
that
we
might
be
certain
that
our
construction
is
not
biased
but
as
we
read
that
case,
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
they
were
not
going
to
consider
the
question
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance
in
the
fields
case.
and
that
by
the
way
was
a
pure
speech
question
involving
the
holding
of
a
meeting.
the
requirement
of
the
ordinance
was
that
the
--
before
a
meeting
could
be
held
in
the
city
of
fairfield,
permit
from
the
mayor
must
be
procured.
fields
was
holding
a
meeting,
was
planned
to
hold
a
meeting,
he
did
not
procure
a
permit.a
temporary
injunction
was
issued
on
that
ground.
the
court
said
that
they
would
not
go
into
the
question
of
the
ordinance
or
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
either
on
space
or
otherwise
because
they
couldn't
reach
it.
and
they
took
the
naacp
case
and
referred
to
it.
they
cited
the
mine
workers
case.
they
cite
howat
versus
kansas.
and
they
concluded
that
as
a
general
rule
they
said
unconstitutional
statute
is
that
--
is
an
absolute
nullity.
it
may
not
be
the
basis
of
an
illegal
right
or
legal
proceedings.
but
however
though,
when
an
injunction
has
been
issued
and
without
taking
the
normal
means
of
attacking
that
injunction
by
a
motion
to
dissolve
a
discharge,
the
defendant
may
not
in
criminal
contempt
in
--
in
a
con
--
appeal
or
certiorari
from
criminal
contempt
raise
the
question
of
its
unconstitutionality
and
collateral
proceedings
on
appeal,
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
the
contempt
case
or
on
that
case
read
as
habeas
corpus
or
for
certiorari.
mr.
earl
mcbee
this
is
the
fields
case,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
alabama
fields
case,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
fields
case
is
143
so.
2d
--
i
have
forgotten
the
page,
page
177,
143
so.2d,
143
so.2d,
page
147
--
177.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
citing
the
cases
that
they
relied
upon,
in
support
of
that
doctrine,
they
cited
the
case
united
mine
workers.
they
cited
howat
versus
kansas.
they
cited
the
people
versus
boshar
(ph),
an
old
supreme
court
new
york
case
in
which
the
case
--
the
court
there
said
that
they
would
not
consider
the
unconstitutionality
of
an
ordinance
or
act,
the
basis
of
an
injunction
as
invalidating
the
ordinance
of
the
injunction
or
making
that
erroneous
or
making
void
of
these.
it
would
be
erroneous
upon
of
course,
a
proper
appeal
from
a
motion
made
to
dissolve
or
from
carrying
on
the
merits
of
the
injunction
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no,
sir.
no
sir.
they
said
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
that
--
they
said
we
cannot
say
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
then
they
proceeded
to
say
that
we
can't
reach
that
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
collateral
here
--
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
i
--
i
construed
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
construed
that,
may
it
please
the
court
to
mean
that
they
were
saying
that
they
did
not
get
to
that
question
because
they
immediately
went
into
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
the
mine
workers
case
and
they
did
cite,
and
rely
upon
boshar
(ph)
and
the
other
cases
which
say
that
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act
or
ordinance
is
not
--
does
not
render
the
injunction
void.
that's
clearly
the
people
versus
boshar
(ph)
that
the
first
case
after
howat.
now
in
reference
to
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
rules,
the
rule,
that
--
it
has
(inaudible)
to
it,
all
the
way
through.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
the
(voice
overlap)
of
our
case,
yes,
that's
right.
now
getting
over
to
the
question
of
the
mine
workers
doctrine
and
its
limitations
or
of
any
event,
the
first
suggestion
has
been
made
that
in
re
green,
militates
against
that
case.
now
as
i
read
in
re
green,
the
fault
or
the
vice
of
that
case
was
that
this
lawyer
was
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
that
is
constructive
contempt,
without
being
afford
a
hearing.
he
tried
to
defend
his
case
but
was
deprived
of
that
privilege.
as
i
understand
the
opinion
which
was
written
reasonably
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
comment
was
made
about
the
mine
workers
case
but
the
question
though,
the
primitive
question
was
that
there
was
no
hearing.
and
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that,
that
that
illustrated
the
device
of
the
whole
thing.
that
is
the
preemption
doctrine
because
you
couldn't
tell
whether
it's
in
the
preemption
doctrine
involved
or
not.
in
as
much
as
they
never
did
reached
that
question.
they
never
did
give
a
chance
for
the
court
to
determine
that
question.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
i
believe
in
the
--
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
did
say
that
he
did
not
feel
that
that
case
will
take
against
the
mine
workers
doctrine
and
there
i
believed
conclude
that
the
mine
workers
doctrine
holds
that
even
if
the
federal
courts
were
barred
by
the
acts
of
congress
from
issuing
the
injunction
in
that
case,
that
nevertheless,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
defendants
to
abide
and
perform
the
injunction
at
least
while
it
was
in
effect.
and
until
it
was
dissolved
or
discharged
or
some
other
method
used
to
dislodge
it
and
it
should
be
obeyed.
and
that
failure
to
do
so
would
constitute
criminal
contempt.
that
we
say
is
--
we
feel
is
the
holding
of
that
case
clearly.
now,
there
has
been
much
said
about
the
vagueness
of
the
injunction.
actually,
the
injunction
does
say
very
specifically
that
the
action
above
designated
i've
read
to
in
the
appellate
complaint
or
the
acts
that
are
related
to
and
are
enjoined
and
specifically
referred
to.
among
those
acts
related
to
in
connection
with
mass
picketing
and
mass
street
parades,
mass
processions
or
like
demonstrations
without
a
permit
we
have
again
foresee
of
the
bill
of
complaint
a
situation
very
similar
to
those
that
which
developed
on
april
8,
12,
and
april
the
14th,
that
is
to
say
the
good
friday
and
the
easter
parades.
we
say
that
those
particular
demonstrations,
the
forerunner
of
those
particular
demonstrations
were
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
complaint.
now
if
there'd
be
any
question
about
what
type
of
injunction
is
issued
and
what
it
means
and
what
it
is
required
to
do,
we
say
that
under
the
authorities,
the
requirement
is
that
the
court
or
the
courts
in
construction
refer
back
to
the
original
bill
of
complaint
and
read
the
injunction
in
the
light
of
the
original
complaint.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
in
involving
the
defendants,
exactly
what
took
place,
the
injunction
was
issued
on
the
evening
of
the
10th
of
april.
on
the
morning
of
april
the
10th
--
11th,
it
was
served
upon
the
defendants.
at
that
time,
they
pronounced
that
they
would
not
abide
it,
that
they
would
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
first
time
they
said
it
was
at
the
time
the
injunction
was
served
upon
them.
the
second
time
they
said
it
was
when
they
had
a
press
conference
about
11
o'clock
or
thereabouts
on
the
morning
of
the
11th
of
april.
at
which
time
they
said,
“we
will
march
tomorrow,
saturday,
sunday,
monday,
and
on.”
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
didn't
specify
how
many
would
march.
no,
they
did
not
know
sir.
but
they
would
march.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
had
a
meeting
then
on
the
night
of
the
--
on
the
night
of
11th
at
which
time
--
and
by
the
way
too
i
may
add
this
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
in
the
easter
march,
there
were
approximately
1500
to
2000
in
which
the
entire
streets,
the
sidewalks,
everything
was
covered
from
side
to
side.
on
the
march
which
occurred
on
the
12th
of
april,
they
have
--
most
of
the
time
they
were
on
the
sidewalks
using
each
sidewalk,
but
sometimes
the
street,
but
in
the
main,
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
april
of
--
the
12th,
good
friday
march.
mr.
earl
mcbee
only
--
the
only
constitutional
right
they
claimed
was
when
they
came
into
court
and
said
that,
“you
have
violated
our
constitutional
rights.”
when
they
filed
their
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction
after
the
act
had
been
committed.
they
committed
the
good
friday
marches
and
they
also
--
they
marched
on
the
14th
of
easter
sunday
before
ever
making
any
effort
at
all
whatsoever
to
obtain
any
sort
of
relief,
obtain
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
any
sort
of
permit
and
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
marched
actually
two
days,
the
12th
and
the
14th.
mr.
earl
mcbee
on
the
12th,
the
information
they
let
out,
they
didn't
give
very
much
information
but
they'd
let
out
information,
they
were
going
to
march
on
at
noon.
however,
in
form
of
actual
fact,
they
did
not
march
at
noon
but
they
really
marched
about
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
on
one
side
of
the
street,
there
were
--
well,
the
evidence
is
over
50
because
over
50
were
arrested.
but
also
they
did
not
arrest
all
because
they
couldn't
get
to
all
of
them.
they
were
on
two
sides
of
the
street.
and
all
together,
the
evidence
is
that
there
were
some
thousands
involved
in
the
entire
proceeding,
approximately
a
thousand.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
--
well
no
sir.
now
that
--
that
is
only
a
part.
now
that
group,
it's
true,
did
march.
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
the
evidence
is
and
mr.
painter
(ph),
while
the
witness
--
a
witness
for
the
city
testified
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
the
group
outside
of
the
church
were
also
siphoned
into
and
they
engaged
in
a
march
along
with
the
other
marchers.
in
other
words,
this
technique
of
having
the
crowd
and
the
marches
intermingle
apparently
had
been
followed
in
other
cases
in
the
(inaudible)
movement
and
another
situations.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
joined
in.
they
joined
in
and
went
with
the
group.
they
were
engaged
and
--
heading
so
they
said
to
the
city
hall
that's
where
their
objective
was.
and
they
would
let
--
going
in
that
direction
at
the
time
the
arrest
took
place.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
believe
that
--
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
--
of
inspector
hailey
was
that
approximately
50
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
or
more
than
50
at
least.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
were
in
the
--
it
said
there
were
at
least
50
because
they
arrested
that
many.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
147.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
now
--
oh,
and
may
it
please
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
--
i
didn't
refer
to
1500
on
that
day.
now
that
was
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
was
on
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
depends
on
upon
which
particular
parade
you're
discussing.
now
the
good
friday
parade,
the
testimony
of
mr.
hailey
--
the
inspector
hailey
was
that
51,
at
least
51
were
in
that
parade
because
that
many
were
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
but
they
didn't
arrest
them
all.
now
on
the
good
friday
parade
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
50
basically
were
on
the
sidewalk.
and
i
believe
the
others
were
on
the
sidewalks
too.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
that
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
street.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
the
shuttlesworth
case
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
upon
is
now
before
the
supreme
court
but
has
not
yet
ruled.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
they
haven't
ruled
it.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir.
that
have
not.
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i'm
not
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
not
less
than
50
because
they
arrested
that
many,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
not
on
that
side
of
the
street,
i
believe.
no
sir.
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
the
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
the
testimony
of
mr.
painter
(ph),
he
is
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
said
that
the
crowd
on
the
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
on
page
207.
he
said
the
crowd
and
the
procession
could
be
described
as
one.
he
said
the
entire
crowd
was
about
a
thousand,
800
to
a
thousand.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
several
hundred
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
i
believe
he
said.
mr.
earl
mcbee
at
page
207
of
the
record,
is
where
the
particular
matter
was
discussed.
now,
down
there,
the
middle
of
the
page
i
believe,
this
group
was
led
by
reverend
martin
luther
king
jr.,
reverend
ralph
abernathy,
and
reverend
shuttlesworth
as
i
recall.
there
were
several
people
falling
in
formation.
there
are
several
people
who
were
falling
in
this
formation.
as
the
group
marched
away
from
the
church
in
the
direction
of
downtown,
a
group
of
persons
who
had
assembled
along
the
sidewalk
and
the
street
followed
this
procession,
this
group
of
people
who
consist
of
several
hundred.
this
group
on
the
march
is
actually
the
whole
procession
was
going
as
a
group.
as
the
group
came
out
the
church,
then
the
whole
groups
of
people
who
had
assembled
along
the
sidewalk
fell
along
behind
them.
and
i
think
you
could
describe
it
as
one
procession.
mr.
earl
mcbee
now,
actually
the
march,
the
14th
proceeding
involved
and
there
are
some
pictures
at
pages
210
i
believe
of
the
record
in
which
it
is
apparent
that
they
were
taking
in
the
entire
sidewalk
of
both
sides
and
also
the
street.
it
was
a
procession
of
some
--
variously
estimated
from
a
thousand
to
1500
to
2000
people
involved.
mr.
earl
mcbee
not,
not
210
--
410,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
in
the
back,
yes
it's
in
the
back,
yes.
the
first
picture
there
indicates
the
march
of
--
as
it
--
that
day
of
the
march
--
the
origin
of
the
march
was
not
the
church
shown
in
the
picture
but
it
was
a
block
and
a
half
or
two
blocks
below
that,
the
march
began.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
unless
you
might
say
that
it
was
done
by
the
lawyers
after
they
file
their
motion
to
dissolve
after
the
marches
took
place
but
not
perhaps
the
marches.
mr.
earl
mcbee
not
prior
to
the
marches,
no
sir.
they
made
no
such
contention,
at
least
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
appears
in
the
record
anyway.
that
was
this
march
that
that
developed
into
a
rather
violent
and
belligerent
mob.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
march
of
april
the
12th,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
prior
march
which
is
described
in
the
bill
of
complaint.
the
crowd
became
unruly.
it
became
violent.
some
people
were
injured.
one
person
at
least
was
injured.
a
police
officer
was
narrowly
missed
by
a
large
brick.
some
--
damage
to
some
city
property
occurred
and
that
a
three-wheeler
was
damaged,
the
radio
and
i
believe
the
windshield
and
some
other
things
possibly.
and
there
were
some
--
a
number
of
people
arrested
for
resisting
arrest.
there
were
a
number
arrested
for
assault
and
battery
in
connection
to
the
throwing
of
rocks,
and
so
on.
these
crowds
were
solicited
i
think
i
should
add.
mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
impossible
to
tell
because
the
whole
thing
degenerated
into
a
mob.
those
who
were
in
the
parade
and
everybody
else
generate
into
a
mob,
you
couldn't
tell.
no
way
to
tell.
but
we
do
say
this
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
that
is
the
petitioners
in
this
case
apparently
took
responsibility
because
during
the
course
of
the
afternoon,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
painter
(ph),
the
respondent
wyatt
tee
walker,
told
him
that
he
could
control
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
is
respondent
wyatt
tee
walker.
mr.
earl
mcbee
told
a
witness
painter
(ph,
who
was
the
witness
for
the
city
that
it
was
entirely
possible
for
him
and
he
could
as
a
matter
of
fact
guarantee
that
no
one
would
get
out
of
control.
that
he
could
control
this
crowd
of
people
without
any
problem
at
all.
he
would
guarantee.
the
officer
raised
the
question
that
--
engaged
him
getting
that
many
people
together
involved
in
a
demonstration
would
pose
some
problems
of
possible
balance
and
possible
danger
to
people
or
to
property.
and
at
that
time,
mr.
reverend
walker
stated
that
he
could
control
the
crowd.
and
then
he
said
if
anybody
got
hurt,
it
would
be
due
to
the
officers
and
nobody
else.
mr.
earl
mcbee
due
to
the
officers
doing
it
and
not
these
people.
he
could
control
them.
now
the
evidence
is
that
they
did
con
--
they
did
assemble
outside.
and
i
believe
the
witness,
hays
(ph)
who
as
a
witness
for
the
peti
--
that
is
the
respondents
and
who
was
one
--
who
is
one
of
the
respondents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
here
testified
that
he
went
down
to
the
church
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating.
and
also
--
a
mr.
shorz
(ph)
in
examining
some
of
the
witness
testified
that
or
rather
examined
the
witnesses
ref
--
with
reference
to
a
parade
or
a
procession.
now
the
ordinance
involved
--
now,
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
or
not
the
owners
involved
--
involves
anything
other
than
streets,
parades
or
street
--
use
of
the
sidewalks.
but
in
--
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ordinance
does
involve
mass
street
parades,
processions,
or
like
demonstrations
without
a
permit,
nor
was
--
it
does
involve
parades
and
processions
and
things
of
that
kind
which
conducted
mass
and
which
of
course,
whether
the
type
of
situation
that
was
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
ordinance
does
pro
--
and
does
prohibit
engaging
in
sponsoring
and
citing
on
--
or
rather
of
mass
street
parades,
processions,
or
like
demonstrations
without
a
permit
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
as
on
public
streets.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
public
ways,
well
that's
right.
public
ways
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
way.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir.
we
made
no
effort
to
do
that.
never
has
to
be
con
--
been
construed.
mr.
earl
mcbee
those
are
the
easter
parade,
yes
sir.
they
were
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
those
four.
and
they
were
taken
by
the
way
by
a
united
press
photographer.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
they
were
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
were
in
the
contempt
case
and
they
were
introduced,
and
are
filed
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
exhibit
was
introduced
by
the
city
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
(inaudible).
i
might
say
it
was
a
nasty
thing
that
those
exhibits
will
go
to
court
by
the
respondents
but
we
introduced
them
in
evidence
though.
now
we
simply
say,
may
it
please
the
court
that
we
don't
--
we
have
more
than
a
first
amendment
freedom
case.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
it
would
be
a
travesty
to
have
a
situation
where
a
group
of
people
who
start
out
for
the
purpose,
obvious
purpose,
of
getting
put
in
jail
during
the
various
meetings
that
were
held
from
time
to
time
by
this
group
on
the
evenings
of
the
11th,
and
the
12th,
and
the
13th,
they
were
constantly
recruiting
people
to
go
to
jail.
even
in
one
instance
on
friday
night
i
believe,
reverend
walker,
wyatt
tee
walker
recruited
a
dozen
or
so
negros
willing
to
die
for
me.
all
of
the
witnesses
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
you
mean
why
did
he
say
that?
mr.
earl
mcbee
where
is
that
evidence?
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
was
the
testimony
of
mr.
walter
johnson
who
is
a
representative
of
the
united
press
or
the
aap,
i'm
not
sure,
from
mobile.
that
testimony
is
on
page
--
is
repeated
several
times,
is
on
page
203.
during
the
discussions
that
occurred
on
the
--
at
these
meetings,
among
other
things,
the
leaders
were
upset
because
they
said
that
mr.
al
hibbler,
who
is
a
blind
negro
singer,
was
discriminated
against
because
he
was
not
arrested.
and
they
didn't
like
it,
they
say
it.
in
fact,
the
reverend
martin
luther
king
and
the
reverend
abernathy
had
planed
to
have
a
march
or
make
their
move
as
they
called
it,
on
thursday.
mr.
hibbler
had
gone
on
wednesday
and
they
were
going
on
thursday.
but
since
mr.
hibbler
had
not
been
arrested,
they
won't
give
him
another
chance
to
be
arrested,
so
they
sent
him
out
again
on
thursday.
and
they
then,
postponed
their
move
as
they
said
until
friday
at
which
time
they
did
make
their
move
and
the
result
was
that
they
get
arrested.
during
the
course
of
these
meetings,
reverend
walker
made
the
statement
that
he
had
something
that
he
wanted
of
the
school
population.
he
said
grades
one
through
graduate
school.
among
other
things,
he
said
that
the
students,
the
student
population
could
get
a
better
education
in
five
days
in
city
jail
than
they
could
get
in
five
months
in
the
segregated
schools.
there
was
all
the
way
through
these
proceedings,
a
very
obvious
effort
to
get
people
arrested.
there
was
no
effort
made
at
all
to
obtain
a
permit
from
the
city
commission.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
argue
with
the
court
below
and
we
think
the
argument
should
be
repeated
here
that
they
didn't
make
any
request
because
obviously
they
didn't
intend
--
they
didn't
want
to
get
a
permit.
they
wanted
to
get
arrested.
that
was
the
whole
procedure.
and
they
intended
to
get
arrested
in
order
to
accomplish
whatever
purposes
they
felt
were
desirable
for
their
ends
and
their
goals
to
be
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
is
our
contention
that
that
and
the
court
so
ruled
that
that
was
an
entirely
a
collateral
issue.
he
said
that,
“if
you
will
come
in
here,
when
you
move
to
dissolve
the
injunction
and
you
will
show
those
facts,
then
i
can
do
something
about
it.
but
you
elected
though
to
violate
the
injunction.
and
as
a
result
of
that
election,
you've
closed
my
hands
to
this
matter."
"this
time,
i
can
do
it”,
he
said
at
the
proper
time.
“but
i
can't
do
since
you
elected
to
violate
the
injunction
defiantly
as
you
did
without
have
--
asking
me
to
do
something
about
it,”
and
so
that
that
would
be
a
collateral
attack,
directly
collateral
attack.
mr.
earl
mcbee
what
they
contended
was,
i
don't
believe
they
contended
it
had
been
discriminate
or
--
discriminatorily
applied
so
much
as
what
they
contended
was
that
there
had
been
no
practice
in
the
past
to
obtain
a
permit
through
the
city
commission.
i
believe
that
was
the
burden
of
their
argument.
they
wanted
to
--
they
said
to
prove
that
that
had
not
been
the
practice.
but
however
though,
the
ordinance
specifically
said
and
as
early
as
april
the
5th,
commissioner
connor
himself
notified
the
reverend
shuttlesworth
that
the
proper
way
by
telegram,
the
proper
way
to
proceed
if
they
want
to
proceed
would
be
to
apply
to
the
city
commission.
and
the
court
said
that
he
would
be
glad
to
hear
any
evidence
of
anything
that
happened
after
the
injunction
occurred
and
the
matter
that
were
before
the
court
was
involved
but
he
would
not
and
did
not
feel
that
he
would
like
to
go
into
collateral
issues
at
this
particular
time.
now
from
the
very
beginning
all
the
way
through
the
case,
and
on
for
the
record
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
what
they
said
was
that
--
what
they
all
--
what
to
proof
was
as
i
recall,
they
put
the
city
clerk
on
the
stand
i
believe
and
asked
him
whether
or
not
it
had
been
the
custom
of
the
city
commission
to
issue
injunctions.
i
believe
that
was
the
tenor
of
the
proof
that
was
extended.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
permits,
i'm
sorry.
i
used
the
wrong
word.
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
really
honestly
couldn't
answer
that
question,
i
had
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
honestly
because
i
had
not
been
with
the
city
at
that
time
but
a
very
short
time.
mr.
earl
mcbee
and
i
was
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
i
really
cannot.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
only
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
only
thing
that
i
do
recall
and
i
do
have
some
recollection
of
this.
there
was
an
application
made,
a
request
made
to
the
mayor
and
to
the
--
and
to
commissioner
connor
by
mr.
shelton
who
was
the
ku
klux
clan
officer
or
some
official
to
have
a
demonstration
on
the
city
steps
and
i
remember
that
they
said
no.
that's
all
i
can
recall
specifically
about
this
particular
matter.i
do
not
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
they
--
they
were
--
they
were
--
that
they
--
that
there
was
a
three
commission,
three
member
commission.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
were
a
majority.
they
were
a
majority,
yes.
they
could
speak.
mr.
earl
mcbee
three
commissioners,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
actually
yes,
under
that
form
of
government.
now
i
think
the
background
of
this
matter
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
and
that
is
this.
much
has
been
said
about
commissioner
connor.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
commissioner
connor
had
been
defeated.
the
city
of
birmingham
had
made
a
change
in
the
form
of
government.
i
think
possibly
because
of
mr.
--
some
of
mr.
connor's
extreme
views
perhaps.
i
don't
know.
i
couldn't
say
that.
but
at
any
rate,
there's
been
a
change
of
government.
mr.
earl
mcbee
and
the
--
this
mere
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
council
form
of
government
had
been
installed.
mr.
earl
mcbee
now
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
it
happened
possibly
a
few
months
before.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
newly
elected
officers,
mayor
boutwel
and
the
council
had
been
elected.
there
was
at
that
particular
moment,
the
only
thing
which
prevented
them
from
taking
office
was
a
question
at
law
which
was
being
determined
by
the
board,
i
mean
in
the
courts,
whether
or
not
they
were
required
to
go
into
an
office
immediately
of
where
they
had
to
wait
a
period
of
time
before
they
could
take
office.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
no,
no.
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
but
i
just
simply
emphasizing
the
fact
that
that
commissioner
connor
was
on
his
way
out
as
a
power
in
the
city
of
birmingham
at
that
time.
mr.
earl
mcbee
pending
the
determination
of
when
the
new
officers
took
office,
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
had
already
taken
place,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
actually,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
they
took
over
in
may
of
1923
--
i
mean
1963
in
may
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
this
is
in
april.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
would
like
--
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
that
--
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
because
that's
just
what
i
was
going
to
say.
what
happened
was
this,
when
the
convictions
were
handed
down,
the
--
that
is
in
these
particular
cases
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
the
counsel
for
the
opposing
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
was
on
the
29th
of
april
i
believe.
i
think
that's
correct.
it
was
about
the
29th
of
april.
there
was
an
understanding
between
the
city
council
and
the
counsel
representing
the
parties
that
we
would
not
prosecute
those
cases
further,
that
is
--
that
case
is
rather
pending
their
decision
on
this
particular
case.
and
so
that
is
the
reason
that
we
did
not
--
it
has
not
been
brought
up
for
hearing.
it
has
not
been
prosecuted.
and
i
might
say
since
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
there
has
been
no
effort
whatever
to
enforce
the
1159.
of
course,
it
is
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir
because
it
has
not
been
ruled
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
yet.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
has
not
been
enforced,
no
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
same
--
for
some
of
these
same
petitioners,
reverend
shuttlesworth
is
conducting
demonstrations
right
now
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
it
was
last
week,
i
suppose
he
still
is,
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
were
sentenced
for
five
days
and
$50
i
believe.
now
that
is
the
maximum
penalty
however
in
the
state
of
alabama
for
criminal
contempt,
but
however
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
defendants,
those
that
made
the
defined
statements
and
those
that
just
participated
in
the
actual
marches
and
parades
were
fined
the
same,
no
differences
was
made.
mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
suggestion
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
doctrine
of
alabama
that
is
the
principles
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
relating
to
the
mine
workers
doctrine
relates
back
to
the
very
date
that
this
court
decided
that
case.
in
that
particular
--
at
that
particular
time
there
was
then
pending
in
the
alabama
courts
the
case
of
hecker,
greenwood
versus
hecker,
hecker
versus
greenwood,
and
there
was
also
pending
in
that
at
that
time
the
hotel
restaurant
employees
association
versus
greenwood.
in
that
case,
the
hecker
had
--
and
others
had
been
convicted
of
several
contempt.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
since
the
picketing
and
the
actual
strike
was
no
manners
for
a
lawful
purpose
and
was
legally
conducted,
that
it
did
involve
first
amendment
freedoms
of
assembly
and
speech.
and
that
therefore,
the
court,
the
lower
court
was
erroneous
in
reading
the
injunction.
they
dissolved
the
injunction.
they
then,
using
the
united
mine
workers
case
as
the
background,
determined
that
the
several
contempt
convictions
were
required
to
fall.
but
however,
the
closing
paragraph
of
the
opinion
was
that
in
view
of
the
united
mine
workers
case,
the
right
of
the
greenwoods
or
the
state
to
proceed
in
criminal
contempt
was
not
in
anyway
impaired
by
that
decision.
we
have
read
since
the
--
a
matter
of
the
city
of
fairfield
case
has
been
brought
up,
we
have
read
that
case
again.
and
we
do
not
find
that
that
case
in
anyway
militates
against
the
doctrine
that
we
have
said
in
our
briefs
as
applied
by
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
more
convinced
and
we
would
invite
the
court
to
read
the
case,
nor
that
we
might
be
certain
that
our
construction
is
not
biased
but
as
we
read
that
case,
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
they
were
not
going
to
consider
the
question
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance
in
the
fields
case.
and
that
by
the
way
was
a
pure
speech
question
involving
the
holding
of
a
meeting.
the
requirement
of
the
ordinance
was
that
the
--
before
a
meeting
could
be
held
in
the
city
of
fairfield,
permit
from
the
mayor
must
be
procured.
fields
was
holding
a
meeting,
was
planned
to
hold
a
meeting,
he
did
not
procure
a
permit.a
temporary
injunction
was
issued
on
that
ground.
the
court
said
that
they
would
not
go
into
the
question
of
the
ordinance
or
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
either
on
space
or
otherwise
because
they
couldn't
reach
it.
and
they
took
the
naacp
case
and
referred
to
it.
they
cited
the
mine
workers
case.
they
cite
howat
versus
kansas.
and
they
concluded
that
as
a
general
rule
they
said
unconstitutional
statute
is
that
--
is
an
absolute
nullity.
it
may
not
be
the
basis
of
an
illegal
right
or
legal
proceedings.
but
however
though,
when
an
injunction
has
been
issued
and
without
taking
the
normal
means
of
attacking
that
injunction
by
a
motion
to
dissolve
a
discharge,
the
defendant
may
not
in
criminal
contempt
in
--
in
a
con
--
appeal
or
certiorari
from
criminal
contempt
raise
the
question
of
its
unconstitutionality
and
collateral
proceedings
on
appeal,
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
the
contempt
case
or
on
that
case
read
as
habeas
corpus
or
for
certiorari.
mr.
earl
mcbee
this
is
the
fields
case,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
alabama
fields
case,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
fields
case
is
143
so.
2d
--
i
have
forgotten
the
page,
page
177,
143
so.2d,
143
so.2d,
page
147
--
177.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
citing
the
cases
that
they
relied
upon,
in
support
of
that
doctrine,
they
cited
the
case
united
mine
workers.
they
cited
howat
versus
kansas.
they
cited
the
people
versus
boshar
(ph),
an
old
supreme
court
new
york
case
in
which
the
case
--
the
court
there
said
that
they
would
not
consider
the
unconstitutionality
of
an
ordinance
or
act,
the
basis
of
an
injunction
as
invalidating
the
ordinance
of
the
injunction
or
making
that
erroneous
or
making
void
of
these.
it
would
be
erroneous
upon
of
course,
a
proper
appeal
from
a
motion
made
to
dissolve
or
from
carrying
on
the
merits
of
the
injunction
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no,
sir.
no
sir.
they
said
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
that
--
they
said
we
cannot
say
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
then
they
proceeded
to
say
that
we
can't
reach
that
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
collateral
here
--
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
i
--
i
construed
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
construed
that,
may
it
please
the
court
to
mean
that
they
were
saying
that
they
did
not
get
to
that
question
because
they
immediately
went
into
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
the
mine
workers
case
and
they
did
cite,
and
rely
upon
boshar
(ph)
and
the
other
cases
which
say
that
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act
or
ordinance
is
not
--
does
not
render
the
injunction
void.
that's
clearly
the
people
versus
boshar
(ph)
that
the
first
case
after
howat.
now
in
reference
to
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
rules,
the
rule,
that
--
it
has
(inaudible)
to
it,
all
the
way
through.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
the
(voice
overlap)
of
our
case,
yes,
that's
right.
now
getting
over
to
the
question
of
the
mine
workers
doctrine
and
its
limitations
or
of
any
event,
the
first
suggestion
has
been
made
that
in
re
green,
militates
against
that
case.
now
as
i
read
in
re
green,
the
fault
or
the
vice
of
that
case
was
that
this
lawyer
was
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
that
is
constructive
contempt,
without
being
afford
a
hearing.
he
tried
to
defend
his
case
but
was
deprived
of
that
privilege.
as
i
understand
the
opinion
which
was
written
reasonably
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
comment
was
made
about
the
mine
workers
case
but
the
question
though,
the
primitive
question
was
that
there
was
no
hearing.
and
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that,
that
that
illustrated
the
device
of
the
whole
thing.
that
is
the
preemption
doctrine
because
you
couldn't
tell
whether
it's
in
the
preemption
doctrine
involved
or
not.
in
as
much
as
they
never
did
reached
that
question.
they
never
did
give
a
chance
for
the
court
to
determine
that
question.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
i
believe
in
the
--
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
did
say
that
he
did
not
feel
that
that
case
will
take
against
the
mine
workers
doctrine
and
there
i
believed
conclude
that
the
mine
workers
doctrine
holds
that
even
if
the
federal
courts
were
barred
by
the
acts
of
congress
from
issuing
the
injunction
in
that
case,
that
nevertheless,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
defendants
to
abide
and
perform
the
injunction
at
least
while
it
was
in
effect.
and
until
it
was
dissolved
or
discharged
or
some
other
method
used
to
dislodge
it
and
it
should
be
obeyed.
and
that
failure
to
do
so
would
constitute
criminal
contempt.
that
we
say
is
--
we
feel
is
the
holding
of
that
case
clearly.
now,
there
has
been
much
said
about
the
vagueness
of
the
injunction.
actually,
the
injunction
does
say
very
specifically
that
the
action
above
designated
i've
read
to
in
the
appellate
complaint
or
the
acts
that
are
related
to
and
are
enjoined
and
specifically
referred
to.
among
those
acts
related
to
in
connection
with
mass
picketing
and
mass
street
parades,
mass
processions
or
like
demonstrations
without
a
permit
we
have
again
foresee
of
the
bill
of
complaint
a
situation
very
similar
to
those
that
which
developed
on
april
8,
12,
and
april
the
14th,
that
is
to
say
the
good
friday
and
the
easter
parades.
we
say
that
those
particular
demonstrations,
the
forerunner
of
those
particular
demonstrations
were
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
complaint.
now
if
there'd
be
any
question
about
what
type
of
injunction
is
issued
and
what
it
means
and
what
it
is
required
to
do,
we
say
that
under
the
authorities,
the
requirement
is
that
the
court
or
the
courts
in
construction
refer
back
to
the
original
bill
of
complaint
and
read
the
injunction
in
the
light
of
the
original
complaint.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
in
involving
the
defendants,
exactly
what
took
place,
the
injunction
was
issued
on
the
evening
of
the
10th
of
april.
on
the
morning
of
april
the
10th
--
11th,
it
was
served
upon
the
defendants.
at
that
time,
they
pronounced
that
they
would
not
abide
it,
that
they
would
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
first
time
they
said
it
was
at
the
time
the
injunction
was
served
upon
them.
the
second
time
they
said
it
was
when
they
had
a
press
conference
about
11
o'clock
or
thereabouts
on
the
morning
of
the
11th
of
april.
at
which
time
they
said,
“we
will
march
tomorrow,
saturday,
sunday,
monday,
and
on.”
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
didn't
specify
how
many
would
march.
no,
they
did
not
know
sir.
but
they
would
march.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
had
a
meeting
then
on
the
night
of
the
--
on
the
night
of
11th
at
which
time
--
and
by
the
way
too
i
may
add
this
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
in
the
easter
march,
there
were
approximately
1500
to
2000
in
which
the
entire
streets,
the
sidewalks,
everything
was
covered
from
side
to
side.
on
the
march
which
occurred
on
the
12th
of
april,
they
have
--
most
of
the
time
they
were
on
the
sidewalks
using
each
sidewalk,
but
sometimes
the
street,
but
in
the
main,
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
april
of
--
the
12th,
good
friday
march.
mr.
earl
mcbee
only
--
the
only
constitutional
right
they
claimed
was
when
they
came
into
court
and
said
that,
“you
have
violated
our
constitutional
rights.”
when
they
filed
their
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction
after
the
act
had
been
committed.
they
committed
the
good
friday
marches
and
they
also
--
they
marched
on
the
14th
of
easter
sunday
before
ever
making
any
effort
at
all
whatsoever
to
obtain
any
sort
of
relief,
obtain
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
any
sort
of
permit
and
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
marched
actually
two
days,
the
12th
and
the
14th.
mr.
earl
mcbee
on
the
12th,
the
information
they
let
out,
they
didn't
give
very
much
information
but
they'd
let
out
information,
they
were
going
to
march
on
at
noon.
however,
in
form
of
actual
fact,
they
did
not
march
at
noon
but
they
really
marched
about
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
on
one
side
of
the
street,
there
were
--
well,
the
evidence
is
over
50
because
over
50
were
arrested.
but
also
they
did
not
arrest
all
because
they
couldn't
get
to
all
of
them.
they
were
on
two
sides
of
the
street.
and
all
together,
the
evidence
is
that
there
were
some
thousands
involved
in
the
entire
proceeding,
approximately
a
thousand.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
--
well
no
sir.
now
that
--
that
is
only
a
part.
now
that
group,
it's
true,
did
march.
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
the
evidence
is
and
mr.
painter
(ph),
while
the
witness
--
a
witness
for
the
city
testified
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
the
group
outside
of
the
church
were
also
siphoned
into
and
they
engaged
in
a
march
along
with
the
other
marchers.
in
other
words,
this
technique
of
having
the
crowd
and
the
marches
intermingle
apparently
had
been
followed
in
other
cases
in
the
(inaudible)
movement
and
another
situations.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
joined
in.
they
joined
in
and
went
with
the
group.
they
were
engaged
and
--
heading
so
they
said
to
the
city
hall
that's
where
their
objective
was.
and
they
would
let
--
going
in
that
direction
at
the
time
the
arrest
took
place.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
believe
that
--
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
--
of
inspector
hailey
was
that
approximately
50
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
or
more
than
50
at
least.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
were
in
the
--
it
said
there
were
at
least
50
because
they
arrested
that
many.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
147.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
now
--
oh,
and
may
it
please
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
--
i
didn't
refer
to
1500
on
that
day.
now
that
was
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
was
on
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
depends
on
upon
which
particular
parade
you're
discussing.
now
the
good
friday
parade,
the
testimony
of
mr.
hailey
--
the
inspector
hailey
was
that
51,
at
least
51
were
in
that
parade
because
that
many
were
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
but
they
didn't
arrest
them
all.
now
on
the
good
friday
parade
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
50
basically
were
on
the
sidewalk.
and
i
believe
the
others
were
on
the
sidewalks
too.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
that
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
street.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
the
shuttlesworth
case
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
upon
is
now
before
the
supreme
court
but
has
not
yet
ruled.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
they
haven't
ruled
it.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir.
that
have
not.
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i'm
not
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
not
less
than
50
because
they
arrested
that
many,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
not
on
that
side
of
the
street,
i
believe.
no
sir.
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
the
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
the
testimony
of
mr.
painter
(ph),
he
is
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
said
that
the
crowd
on
the
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
on
page
207.
he
said
the
crowd
and
the
procession
could
be
described
as
one.
he
said
the
entire
crowd
was
about
a
thousand,
800
to
a
thousand.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
several
hundred
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
i
believe
he
said.
mr.
earl
mcbee
at
page
207
of
the
record,
is
where
the
particular
matter
was
discussed.
now,
down
there,
the
middle
of
the
page
i
believe,
this
group
was
led
by
reverend
martin
luther
king
jr.,
reverend
ralph
abernathy,
and
reverend
shuttlesworth
as
i
recall.
there
were
several
people
falling
in
formation.
there
are
several
people
who
were
falling
in
this
formation.
as
the
group
marched
away
from
the
church
in
the
direction
of
downtown,
a
group
of
persons
who
had
assembled
along
the
sidewalk
and
the
street
followed
this
procession,
this
group
of
people
who
consist
of
several
hundred.
this
group
on
the
march
is
actually
the
whole
procession
was
going
as
a
group.
as
the
group
came
out
the
church,
then
the
whole
groups
of
people
who
had
assembled
along
the
sidewalk
fell
along
behind
them.
and
i
think
you
could
describe
it
as
one
procession.
mr.
earl
mcbee
now,
actually
the
march,
the
14th
proceeding
involved
and
there
are
some
pictures
at
pages
210
i
believe
of
the
record
in
which
it
is
apparent
that
they
were
taking
in
the
entire
sidewalk
of
both
sides
and
also
the
street.
it
was
a
procession
of
some
--
variously
estimated
from
a
thousand
to
1500
to
2000
people
involved.
mr.
earl
mcbee
not,
not
210
--
410,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
in
the
back,
yes
it's
in
the
back,
yes.
the
first
picture
there
indicates
the
march
of
--
as
it
--
that
day
of
the
march
--
the
origin
of
the
march
was
not
the
church
shown
in
the
picture
but
it
was
a
block
and
a
half
or
two
blocks
below
that,
the
march
began.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
unless
you
might
say
that
it
was
done
by
the
lawyers
after
they
file
their
motion
to
dissolve
after
the
marches
took
place
but
not
perhaps
the
marches.
mr.
earl
mcbee
not
prior
to
the
marches,
no
sir.
they
made
no
such
contention,
at
least
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
appears
in
the
record
anyway.
that
was
this
march
that
that
developed
into
a
rather
violent
and
belligerent
mob.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
march
of
april
the
12th,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
prior
march
which
is
described
in
the
bill
of
complaint.
the
crowd
became
unruly.
it
became
violent.
some
people
were
injured.
one
person
at
least
was
injured.
a
police
officer
was
narrowly
missed
by
a
large
brick.
some
--
damage
to
some
city
property
occurred
and
that
a
three-wheeler
was
damaged,
the
radio
and
i
believe
the
windshield
and
some
other
things
possibly.
and
there
were
some
--
a
number
of
people
arrested
for
resisting
arrest.
there
were
a
number
arrested
for
assault
and
battery
in
connection
to
the
throwing
of
rocks,
and
so
on.
these
crowds
were
solicited
i
think
i
should
add.
mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
impossible
to
tell
because
the
whole
thing
degenerated
into
a
mob.
those
who
were
in
the
parade
and
everybody
else
generate
into
a
mob,
you
couldn't
tell.
no
way
to
tell.
but
we
do
say
this
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
that
is
the
petitioners
in
this
case
apparently
took
responsibility
because
during
the
course
of
the
afternoon,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
painter
(ph),
the
respondent
wyatt
tee
walker,
told
him
that
he
could
control
that
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
is
respondent
wyatt
tee
walker.
mr.
earl
mcbee
told
a
witness
painter
(ph,
who
was
the
witness
for
the
city
that
it
was
entirely
possible
for
him
and
he
could
as
a
matter
of
fact
guarantee
that
no
one
would
get
out
of
control.
that
he
could
control
this
crowd
of
people
without
any
problem
at
all.
he
would
guarantee.
the
officer
raised
the
question
that
--
engaged
him
getting
that
many
people
together
involved
in
a
demonstration
would
pose
some
problems
of
possible
balance
and
possible
danger
to
people
or
to
property.
and
at
that
time,
mr.
reverend
walker
stated
that
he
could
control
the
crowd.
and
then
he
said
if
anybody
got
hurt,
it
would
be
due
to
the
officers
and
nobody
else.
mr.
earl
mcbee
due
to
the
officers
doing
it
and
not
these
people.
he
could
control
them.
now
the
evidence
is
that
they
did
con
--
they
did
assemble
outside.
and
i
believe
the
witness,
hays
(ph)
who
as
a
witness
for
the
peti
--
that
is
the
respondents
and
who
was
one
--
who
is
one
of
the
respondents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
here
testified
that
he
went
down
to
the
church
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating.
and
also
--
a
mr.
shorz
(ph)
in
examining
some
of
the
witness
testified
that
or
rather
examined
the
witnesses
ref
--
with
reference
to
a
parade
or
a
procession.
now
the
ordinance
involved
--
now,
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
or
not
the
owners
involved
--
involves
anything
other
than
streets,
parades
or
street
--
use
of
the
sidewalks.
but
in
--
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ordinance
does
involve
mass
street
parades,
processions,
or
like
demonstrations
without
a
permit,
nor
was
--
it
does
involve
parades
and
processions
and
things
of
that
kind
which
conducted
mass
and
which
of
course,
whether
the
type
of
situation
that
was
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
ordinance
does
pro
--
and
does
prohibit
engaging
in
sponsoring
and
citing
on
--
or
rather
of
mass
street
parades,
processions,
or
like
demonstrations
without
a
permit
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
as
on
public
streets.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
public
ways,
well
that's
right.
public
ways
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
way.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir.
we
made
no
effort
to
do
that.
never
has
to
be
con
--
been
construed.
mr.
earl
mcbee
those
are
the
easter
parade,
yes
sir.
they
were
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
those
four.
and
they
were
taken
by
the
way
by
a
united
press
photographer.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
they
were
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
were
in
the
contempt
case
and
they
were
introduced,
and
are
filed
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
exhibit
was
introduced
by
the
city
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
(inaudible).
i
might
say
it
was
a
nasty
thing
that
those
exhibits
will
go
to
court
by
the
respondents
but
we
introduced
them
in
evidence
though.
now
we
simply
say,
may
it
please
the
court
that
we
don't
--
we
have
more
than
a
first
amendment
freedom
case.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
it
would
be
a
travesty
to
have
a
situation
where
a
group
of
people
who
start
out
for
the
purpose,
obvious
purpose,
of
getting
put
in
jail
during
the
various
meetings
that
were
held
from
time
to
time
by
this
group
on
the
evenings
of
the
11th,
and
the
12th,
and
the
13th,
they
were
constantly
recruiting
people
to
go
to
jail.
even
in
one
instance
on
friday
night
i
believe,
reverend
walker,
wyatt
tee
walker
recruited
a
dozen
or
so
negros
willing
to
die
for
me.
all
of
the
witnesses
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
you
mean
why
did
he
say
that?
mr.
earl
mcbee
where
is
that
evidence?
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
was
the
testimony
of
mr.
walter
johnson
who
is
a
representative
of
the
united
press
or
the
aap,
i'm
not
sure,
from
mobile.
that
testimony
is
on
page
--
is
repeated
several
times,
is
on
page
203.
during
the
discussions
that
occurred
on
the
--
at
these
meetings,
among
other
things,
the
leaders
were
upset
because
they
said
that
mr.
al
hibbler,
who
is
a
blind
negro
singer,
was
discriminated
against
because
he
was
not
arrested.
and
they
didn't
like
it,
they
say
it.
in
fact,
the
reverend
martin
luther
king
and
the
reverend
abernathy
had
planed
to
have
a
march
or
make
their
move
as
they
called
it,
on
thursday.
mr.
hibbler
had
gone
on
wednesday
and
they
were
going
on
thursday.
but
since
mr.
hibbler
had
not
been
arrested,
they
won't
give
him
another
chance
to
be
arrested,
so
they
sent
him
out
again
on
thursday.
and
they
then,
postponed
their
move
as
they
said
until
friday
at
which
time
they
did
make
their
move
and
the
result
was
that
they
get
arrested.
during
the
course
of
these
meetings,
reverend
walker
made
the
statement
that
he
had
something
that
he
wanted
of
the
school
population.
he
said
grades
one
through
graduate
school.
among
other
things,
he
said
that
the
students,
the
student
population
could
get
a
better
education
in
five
days
in
city
jail
than
they
could
get
in
five
months
in
the
segregated
schools.
there
was
all
the
way
through
these
proceedings,
a
very
obvious
effort
to
get
people
arrested.
there
was
no
effort
made
at
all
to
obtain
a
permit
from
the
city
commission.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
argue
with
the
court
below
and
we
think
the
argument
should
be
repeated
here
that
they
didn't
make
any
request
because
obviously
they
didn't
intend
--
they
didn't
want
to
get
a
permit.
they
wanted
to
get
arrested.
that
was
the
whole
procedure.
and
they
intended
to
get
arrested
in
order
to
accomplish
whatever
purposes
they
felt
were
desirable
for
their
ends
and
their
goals
to
be
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
is
our
contention
that
that
and
the
court
so
ruled
that
that
was
an
entirely
a
collateral
issue.
he
said
that,
“if
you
will
come
in
here,
when
you
move
to
dissolve
the
injunction
and
you
will
show
those
facts,
then
i
can
do
something
about
it.
but
you
elected
though
to
violate
the
injunction.
and
as
a
result
of
that
election,
you've
closed
my
hands
to
this
matter."
"this
time,
i
can
do
it”,
he
said
at
the
proper
time.
“but
i
can't
do
since
you
elected
to
violate
the
injunction
defiantly
as
you
did
without
have
--
asking
me
to
do
something
about
it,”
and
so
that
that
would
be
a
collateral
attack,
directly
collateral
attack.
mr.
earl
mcbee
what
they
contended
was,
i
don't
believe
they
contended
it
had
been
discriminate
or
--
discriminatorily
applied
so
much
as
what
they
contended
was
that
there
had
been
no
practice
in
the
past
to
obtain
a
permit
through
the
city
commission.
i
believe
that
was
the
burden
of
their
argument.
they
wanted
to
--
they
said
to
prove
that
that
had
not
been
the
practice.
but
however
though,
the
ordinance
specifically
said
and
as
early
as
april
the
5th,
commissioner
connor
himself
notified
the
reverend
shuttlesworth
that
the
proper
way
by
telegram,
the
proper
way
to
proceed
if
they
want
to
proceed
would
be
to
apply
to
the
city
commission.
and
the
court
said
that
he
would
be
glad
to
hear
any
evidence
of
anything
that
happened
after
the
injunction
occurred
and
the
matter
that
were
before
the
court
was
involved
but
he
would
not
and
did
not
feel
that
he
would
like
to
go
into
collateral
issues
at
this
particular
time.
now
from
the
very
beginning
all
the
way
through
the
case,
and
on
for
the
record
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
what
they
said
was
that
--
what
they
all
--
what
to
proof
was
as
i
recall,
they
put
the
city
clerk
on
the
stand
i
believe
and
asked
him
whether
or
not
it
had
been
the
custom
of
the
city
commission
to
issue
injunctions.
i
believe
that
was
the
tenor
of
the
proof
that
was
extended.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
permits,
i'm
sorry.
i
used
the
wrong
word.
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
really
honestly
couldn't
answer
that
question,
i
had
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
honestly
because
i
had
not
been
with
the
city
at
that
time
but
a
very
short
time.
mr.
earl
mcbee
and
i
was
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
i
really
cannot.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
only
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
only
thing
that
i
do
recall
and
i
do
have
some
recollection
of
this.
there
was
an
application
made,
a
request
made
to
the
mayor
and
to
the
--
and
to
commissioner
connor
by
mr.
shelton
who
was
the
ku
klux
clan
officer
or
some
official
to
have
a
demonstration
on
the
city
steps
and
i
remember
that
they
said
no.
that's
all
i
can
recall
specifically
about
this
particular
matter.i
do
not
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
they
--
they
were
--
they
were
--
that
they
--
that
there
was
a
three
commission,
three
member
commission.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
were
a
majority.
they
were
a
majority,
yes.
they
could
speak.
mr.
earl
mcbee
three
commissioners,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
actually
yes,
under
that
form
of
government.
now
i
think
the
background
of
this
matter
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
and
that
is
this.
much
has
been
said
about
commissioner
connor.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
commissioner
connor
had
been
defeated.
the
city
of
birmingham
had
made
a
change
in
the
form
of
government.
i
think
possibly
because
of
mr.
--
some
of
mr.
connor's
extreme
views
perhaps.
i
don't
know.
i
couldn't
say
that.
but
at
any
rate,
there's
been
a
change
of
government.
mr.
earl
mcbee
and
the
--
this
mere
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
council
form
of
government
had
been
installed.
mr.
earl
mcbee
now
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
it
happened
possibly
a
few
months
before.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
newly
elected
officers,
mayor
boutwel
and
the
council
had
been
elected.
there
was
at
that
particular
moment,
the
only
thing
which
prevented
them
from
taking
office
was
a
question
at
law
which
was
being
determined
by
the
board,
i
mean
in
the
courts,
whether
or
not
they
were
required
to
go
into
an
office
immediately
of
where
they
had
to
wait
a
period
of
time
before
they
could
take
office.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh,
no,
no.
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
but
i
just
simply
emphasizing
the
fact
that
that
commissioner
connor
was
on
his
way
out
as
a
power
in
the
city
of
birmingham
at
that
time.
mr.
earl
mcbee
pending
the
determination
of
when
the
new
officers
took
office,
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
had
already
taken
place,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
actually,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
they
took
over
in
may
of
1923
--
i
mean
1963
in
may
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
this
is
in
april.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
would
like
--
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
that
--
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
because
that's
just
what
i
was
going
to
say.
what
happened
was
this,
when
the
convictions
were
handed
down,
the
--
that
is
in
these
particular
cases
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
--
the
counsel
for
the
opposing
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
was
on
the
29th
of
april
i
believe.
i
think
that's
correct.
it
was
about
the
29th
of
april.
there
was
an
understanding
between
the
city
council
and
the
counsel
representing
the
parties
that
we
would
not
prosecute
those
cases
further,
that
is
--
that
case
is
rather
pending
their
decision
on
this
particular
case.
and
so
that
is
the
reason
that
we
did
not
--
it
has
not
been
brought
up
for
hearing.
it
has
not
been
prosecuted.
and
i
might
say
since
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
there
has
been
no
effort
whatever
to
enforce
the
1159.
of
course,
it
is
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir
because
it
has
not
been
ruled
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
yet.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
has
not
been
enforced,
no
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
same
--
for
some
of
these
same
petitioners,
reverend
shuttlesworth
is
conducting
demonstrations
right
now
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
it
was
last
week,
i
suppose
he
still
is,
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
were
sentenced
for
five
days
and
$50
i
believe.
now
that
is
the
maximum
penalty
however
in
the
state
of
alabama
for
criminal
contempt,
but
however
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
defendants,
those
that
made
the
defined
statements
and
those
that
just
participated
in
the
actual
marches
and
parades
were
fined
the
same,
no
differences
was
made.
