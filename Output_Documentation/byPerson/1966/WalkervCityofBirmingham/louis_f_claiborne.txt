mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
argument
begins
with
the
premise
that
the
court
will
reach
the
mine
workers
issue
here.
in
saying
that
i
don't
mean
to
disparage
in
any
way
the
argument
which
has
been
made
that
there
is
a
threshold
question
whether
alabama
courts
had
tried
to
this
case,
applied
the
mine
workers'
doctrine
and
therefore
whether
they
may
bar
the
petitioners
from
arguing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
here
because
for
the
first
time,
they
did
invoke
that
doctrine.
there
is
it
seems
to
us
a
strong
argument
to
that
effect.
we
have
not
reached
that
point.
we
have
noted
it
in
our
brief.
we
leave
that
argument
to
the
petitioners
and
we
argue
only
the
question
most
interesting
to
the
united
states
that
most
far
reaching
which
is
the
application
of
the
mine
workers'
rule
in
this
sort
of
context
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
a
question
likely
to
be
reached
by
the
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
likely
to
be
reached
by
the
court
as
we
view
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
without
meaning
in
the
least
to
quarrel
with
but
a
question,
the
mine
workers
doctrine
properly
applied
in
circumstances
which
clearly
called
for
its
application.
we
do
think
it's
important
to
point
out
at
the
outset
what
a
remarkable
extraordinary
rule
it
is
in
some
respects.
it
does
allow
the
imposition
of
criminal
penalties
for
the
violation
of
a
court
order
which
by
definition
is
contrary
to
law
or
contrary
to
constitution.
now
that's
a
principle
rather
unique
in
our
law.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
commands
of
the
legislature
or
of
the
commands
of
the
executive
officers.
a
policeman
tells
someone
to
remain
or
to
move
on
and
that
order
is
improper
or
unconstitutional.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
there
can
be
no
penalty
for
violating
it.
likewise,
there
can
be
no
penalty
through
violating
a
void
statutory
law
nor
can
there
be
any
penalty
for
violating
the
order
of
a
legislative
committee
when
it
directs
a
witness
to
answer
and
he
has
a
constitutional
privilege
to
refuse
to
do
so.
now
in
saying
all
that,
we're
not
as
they
say
trying
to
disparage
the
rule,
we're
trying
to
find
the
reason
which
is
special
to
court
decrees
which
justifies
to
somewhat
harsh
absolute
principle
that
the
mine
workers
doctrine
embodies.
now
why
should
there
be
such
a
special
rule
applicable
only
to
court
orders?
it
seems
to
us
that
there
can
only
be
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
judicial
orders
oriented
in
a
particular
case
directed
against
the
particular
defendant
they
can
find
as
to
time
and
place
and
in
this
respect,
they're
different
from
general
laws
or
general
executive
regulations.
for
the
same
reason,
they're
less
likely
to
be
vulnerable
to
such
defenses
as
inapplicability
are
overbreadth.
demanding
obedience
to
court
orders
is
less
likely
to
cause
widespread
injury
than
blind
obedience
to
more
generalized
laws.
but
even
that
rational
doesn't
carry
us
all
the
way
because
there
is
the
same
specificity
in
a
policeman's
specific
directive
to
a
suspect
to
stop.
and
there
is
the
same
specificity
in
the
order
of
a
legislative
committee
to
witness
to
answer
a
particular
question.
so
there
must
be
another
reason
why
court
orders
are
especially
immune.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
reason
is
that
in
our
system,
courts
are
the
final
authority
with
respect
to
litigable
issues
to
concrete
controversy.
the
considered
judgments
of
courts
must
be
respected
since
they
are
the
final
authority
unless
we're
to
altogether
abandon
the
rule
of
law.
and
because
of
the
way
the
judicial
process
works,
because
courts
need
time
to
decide
cases,
there
are
temporary
stay
orders
to
preserve
the
case,
to
preserve
the
status
quo
must
also
be
respected.
now,
applying
those
rationales
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
important
respects,
they
don't
fit.
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
shipp
case
for
instance
in
which
this
court
had
issued
a
stay
order
pending
an
appeal
here
in
a
capital
conviction
from
a
state
court.
this
court,
in
order
to
give
itself
time
to
decide
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal,
stay
the
execution
of
the
defendant
who
had
been
convicted
and
not
withstanding
that
order,
the
prisoner
was
lynched
allegedly
as
it
was
ultimately
found
with
the
connivance
of
his
custodian,
the
local
sheriff.
that
action
wholly
mooted
the
case
and
prevented
the
judicial
process
from
working.
here
it
seems
to
us
we
have
rather
the
reverse
of
that
situation.
the
issuance
of
the
injunction,
if
it
must
be
obeyed,
mooted
the
legal
controversy.
because
for
all
practical
purposes,
this
parade,
this
march
or
these
marches,
could
not
be
postponed
indefinitely.
their
timing
was
important
in
the
context
of
birmingham
in
1963.
it
could
not
--
this
protest
could
not
serve
its
purpose
several
months
or
several
years
later
when
this
injunction
was
ultimately
vacated
on
appeal
perhaps
even
in
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
no.
i
think
this
court
has
i
think
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
donnovan
case,
they
may
not
lose
and
in
thomas
versus
collins,
texas
badly
did
not
follow
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
argument
is
the
first,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
due
process
clause
in
the
case
of
the
state
bars
a
state
from
applying
the
mine
workers
doctrine
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
prohibits
the
state
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
especially
in
light
of
the
first
amendment
rights
which
are
affected
on
the
other
side.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
ground
would
have
to
turn
on
its
unconstitutionality.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
wouldn't
argue
here
that
this
was
a
mere
procedural
rule
that
had
no
rational
and
no
basis
of
--
so
as
to
prevent
the
usual
defense.
i
think
we
do
rest
on
the
rationale
of
the
green
case
as
i
understand
it,
in
re
green
in
this
court
in
which
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
state
from
denying
the
defense
of
invalidity
with
respect
to
an
injunction
issued
by
a
court
in
an
area
which
was
preempted
by
federal
legislation.
here,
we
would
say
in
one
part
of
our
argument
that
in
--
something
of
the
same
sense
the
area
was
preempted
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
the
court,
state
court
here,
in
issuing
the
sort
of
broad,
overbroad
injunction
citing
first
amendment
rights
was
acting
unconstitutionally
beyond
its
jurisdiction
in
an
area
preempted
by
the
constitution,
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does
seem
to
me
mr.
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say
that
when
the
consequences
of
such
a
rule
are
so
serious
as
they
are
here
that
is
to
bar
the
expected
ability
to
defend
on
the
ground
of
the
invalidity
of
the
injunction.
if
we
assume
that
alabama
had
for
the
most
part
in
the
past,
allowed
in
a
contempt
proceeding,
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding,
the
defendant
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
the
injunction
was
improper
that
expectation
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
invention
of
a
new
rule
which
has
such
a
drastic
effect.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
holding
of
this
court
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
in
anyway
the
argument
that
this
is
the
first
time
alabama
has
applied
this
rule
and
that
therefore,
it's
an
inadequate
state
ground
here.
i
do
begin
on
the
premise
however
that
there
is
some
question
about
that
and
that
the
court
may
have
to
reach
the
mine
workers
doctrine
that
that
is
the
question
which
concerns
most
directly
the
united
states.
it's
reason
for
participating
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
i'm
limiting
my
argument
to
it
without
really
taking
any
position
as
to
whether
the
court
must
reach
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
the
analysis
i
was
suggesting
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
might
explain
a
little
bit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do
accept
those
rulings
of
this
court
which
shall
view
the
first
amendment
as
more
absolutely
preempting
from
state
courts
that
--
for
that
matter
from
federal
courts'
power
to
interfere
in
the
first
amendment
area
then
it's
true
with
respect
to
other
constitutional
guarantees.
i
don't
see
the
necessity
for
reaching
the
question
whether
the
same
principle
would
apply
elsewhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
recent
argument
mr.
justice
stewart
that
a
serious
jurisdic
--
serious
constitutional
inhibition
on
state
action,
court
action
or
whether
under
the
first
amendment
or
in
the
other
would
deprive
that
court
of
jurisdiction
to
act
and
that
therefore
the
same
argument
would
apply.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
something
does
depend,
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
the
specificity
of
the
constitutional
protection
on
the
clarity
with
which
one
can
say
in
advance
that
the
court
is
acting
beyond
its
power.
and
when
we're
dealing
in
the
area
of
the
ninth
or
the
tenth
amendment
that
becomes
far
more
difficult
and
debatable
and
therefore
the
--
perhaps
the
duty
to
obey
should
be
the
greater.
i
think
the
mine
workers
case
itself,
the
case
mr.
justice
franklin's
opinion
indicates
that
if
this
were
a
case
plainly
governed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
then
of
course,
disobedience
could
not
be
punished.
when
the
area
is
so
clearly
withdrawn,
i
think
that
was
the
rational
of
the
green
case
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
very
plainly
withdrawn
from
the
state
court's
old
power
in
this
area.
and
that
can
never
be
true
in
the
area
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
i
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
should
suppose
that
that
in
general
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
injunction
could
be
disobeyed
with
impunity
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
could
--
i
would,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so
mr.
justice
fortas.
however,
it
maybe
that
in
order
to
get
over
the
hurdle,
one
must
prove
that
the
injunction
is
plainly
invalid
and
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
case,
i
took
that
to
be
the
case
and
therefore
answer
the
question
as
it
is.
but
certainly,
analytically,
one
first
decides
whether
the
defense
is
available
and
then
tries
out
the
--
whether
the
defense
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
would
be
a
somewhat
different
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
because
here,
there
was
no
scheduling
of
a
hearing
on
the
merit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
recognized
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
there
is
a
strong
argument
that
even
in
the
situation
you
posed
because
it
is
an
unconstitutional
prior
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
which
is
with
exceptions
not
relevant
here
are
wholly
improper
at
least
when
we're
dealing
with
an
injunction
of
this
breadth
which
has
no
escape
now
that
it
prohibits
parades
of
--
at
any
time,
at
any
place
in
the
city
for
the
indefinite
future.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
there
was
not.
it
was
issued
ex
parte,
nine
o'clock
at
night
upon
the
application
of
the
city.
so
far
as
appears
the
application
was
made.
the
judge
ordered
the
injunction
to
issue,
the
clerk
did
issue
it
all
in
space
of
minutes
of
course
appears
without
any
hearing
and
notice
so
the
injunction
was
then
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
was
the
contempt
hearing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
contempt
hearing.
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
never
was
a
hearing
--
a
motion
to
dissolve
was
--
to
dissolve
the
injunction
was
filed
although
after
the
parades
involved
here
the
day
after,
the
monday,
the
last
parade
here
is
the
easter
sunday
parade.
and
the
petitioner
did
ask
that
that
motion
be
taken
up
first
rather
than
the
contempt
citation
which
was
filed
later
that
day.the
judge
reversed
the
order
of
the
questions,
never
reached
the
question
of
the
solution
and
filed
the
petitioners
in
contempt.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
we're
able
to
determine,
it
is
technically
still
pending
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
(inaudible)
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
that
motion?
there
was
on
the
day
when
the
--
in
facts,
when
the
motion
was
filed,
it
was
set
for
a
hearing
a
week
hence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
motion
to
dissolve.
on
the
day
--
oh,
that
same
day,
later
that
same
day,
this
was
monday,
the
april
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
monday
after
the
parade.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
citation
for
contempt
is
--
or
a
motion
to
add
the
--
petitioners
held
in
contempt
is
filed
in
that
city
and
it
was
set
for
the
same
day
a
week
hence.
when
that
day
came,
the
petitioner
is
asked
for
a
hearing
on
their
motion
to
dissolve
since
it
had
been
(inaudible).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
city
objected
it
and
the
court
shows
to
consider
the
contempt
first
and
never
reach
the
motion
to
dissolve
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
never
yet
reached
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
--
applying
the
mine
workers
rule
that
the
question
became
moot.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
we're
able
to
determine
under
alabama
law
the
injunction
is
still
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
none.
no.
as
we
understand
the
local
law
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
guess
that
it
maybe
the
burden
of
the
petitioners,
if
they
want
that
tro
dissolved
that
is
if
the
city
still
views
it
has
in
effect
then
have
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
but
i
suppose
that
they
are
free
to
come
into
court
at
anytime
that
have
been
for
sometime
in
ask
for
its
--
for
the
dissolution
of
that
tro
or
for
that
matter
to
appeal
it,
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
go
to
the
facts
of
this
case
since
--
and
i
don't
think
it's
my
burden
to
show
that
the
kind
of
parade
actually
held
was
protected.
i
don't
mean
to
question
that
one
way
or
the
other.
but
i
do
think
there
are
cases
in
this
court
which
hold
that
the
injunction
which
was
any
parade
that
held
or
any
other
at
any
time,
in
any
part
of
the
city,
under
any
circumstances
for
any
purpose,
that
the
cases
which
are
so
hold
or
cited
in
the
footnote
in
the
cox
case,
now
that
--
one
aspect
to
the
invalidity
of
this
injunction,
it's
overbreadth,
its
failure
to
provide
any
sort
of
temporizing
escape
though.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir,
i
don't
think
this
issue
has
ever
come
before
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
context.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
so
--
as
i
was
about
to
suggest
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
other
defect
and
the
more,
perhaps
the
clearer
defect
in
both
the
ordinance
and
the
injunction
which
does
nothing
more
than
repeat
the
ordinance
with
no
narrowing
whatever
is
precisely
the
permit
or
aspect
of
it.
it
allows
the
city,
its
commission
to
withhold
the
permit
on
a
series
of
grounds
which
amount
to
absolute
unconfined
discretion
in
the
city
to
grant
or
withhold
the
permit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
rule
in
this
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
as
i
understand
it
ever
since
thornhill
and
alabama
and
then
repeated
only
two
times
ago
in
cox
and
louisiana,
is
that
even
one
who
might
have
fully
asking
obtained
such
a
permit
has
standing
to
challenge
this
censorship
procedure
of
the
municipality.
that
whether
that
applies
to
parades,
or
to
meetings,
or
to
speech,
the
court
has
applied
it
in
all
of
those
instances.
in
cox
of
course
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
demonstration
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
--
with
special
safeguards,
there
maybe
some
licensing,
some
censorship
in
the
movie
area,
but
has
been
very
cautious
it
seems
to
me
to
confine
that
exception
both
narrowly
to
that
area
and
to
insist
in
subsequent
cases
that
there'd
be
as
many
safeguards
as
possible
and
that
there
not
be
any
greater
prior
restraint
without
hearing
than
is
necessary.
here
we're
dealing
with
the
ex
parte
order
and
not
a
considered
adjudication
after
adversary
hearing.
and
at
the
same
time,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
state
order
entered
to
preserve
the
status
quo
because
this
order
leaves
nothing
open
on
the
merits.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
meant
to
say
that
this
court
has
held
that
generally
and
perhaps
in
somewhat
other
--
somewhat
different
context
that
a
prior
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
with
the
exception
of
the
movie
area
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
is
forbidden.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
not
beyond
the
power
of
a
city
to
control
but
beyond
the
power
of
the
city
perhaps
to
forbid
all
together
under
all
circumstances
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
cox
case
amongst
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
cox
case
most
recently
indicated
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
an
absolute
ban
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
did
not.
no
sir.
but
it
did
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
i
say
the
--
i
don't
have
them
at
hand
but
the
cox's
opinion
in
suggesting
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
in
this
case,
we
not
only
have
what
seems
in
one
sense
like
a
complete
prohibition
on
all
parades
of
any
kind
whether
or
not
they
obstruct
traffic
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
can
only
reply
your
honor
back
to
the
cox
case
and
those
cited
on
the
footnote.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
--
the
cox
case
did
not
so
hold
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
any
case
specifically
so
holds
but
the
other
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
other
flaw
here,
mr.
justice
black
is
that
this
injunction
does
track
a
permit
ordinance
which
allows
the
city
officials
to
waive
this
bar
on
parades
whenever
they
choose
in
their
absolute
unconfined
discretion.
and
there
are
many
cases
in
this
court
which
hold
that
that
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
and
that
is
also
involved
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
unlike
cox
and
new
hampshire
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
no
narrowing
construction
of
the
permits
requirement
which
might
arguably
save
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
but
this
case
dates
from
april
1963
as
does
the
shuttlesworth
case
which
was
decided
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeal.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
still
not
decided
the
question
in
that
criminal
case
in
that
shuttlesworth
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
but
that
very
issue
was
decided
in
the
shuttlesworth
case.
the
alabama
court
of
appeal
itself
held
this
ordinance
unconstitutional
in
three
respects.
well,
unconstitutionally
in
two
respects
inapplicable
in
the
third.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
while
having
granted
certiorari
review,
that
decision
has
not
decided
it.
that
would
seem
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
the
appropriate
place
to
have
it
decided.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
an
indication
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
an
indication.
now,
i
frankly
--
i'm
not
such
an
expert
to
alabama
law
to
discuss
it
but
i
assume
that
to
be
the
thing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
injunction
is
reproduced
on
pages
four
and
five
of
our
brief,
reply
brief.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
congregating
on
the
street,
all
public
places
into
mobs,
all
public
places
into
mobs.
well,
that's
6th
line
down
on
page
5.
now,
we
don't
rely
on
that
portion
of
the
injunction
because
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
that's
directly
at
issue
here.
the
violation
charged
here
is
a
violation
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
simply
would,
and
we
do
point
to
the
--
of
--
in
if
--
as
we
understand
that
this
injunction
does
two
things.
it
says
first,
you
shall
not
violate
the
ordinance
--
the
permit,
parade
ordinance
of
the
city,
nor
shall
you
do
anything
else
unlawful.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
its
--
we
feel
compelled
to
that
argument
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
violation
of
the
injunction
charged
here
is
a
violation
of
that
part
of
the
injunction
which
track
the
ordinance.
the
reason
that
we
charge
contempt
does
not
rest
on
a
congregating
in
the
park
into
mobs.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no.
i
say
nothing
about
the
parade
itself
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
i
--
i'm
treating
the
injunction
as
severable
into
that
portion
which
covers
parades
and
that
portion
which
covers
other
activities.
i
maybe
wrong
in
that.
it
maybe
proper
to
treat
the
injunction
as
one
or
too
broad
in
addition
on
any
first
amendment
conduct
whether
it's
picketing
or
meeting
in
the
park,
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
--
perhaps
we
should
rely
on
it.
we
do
point
out
that
it
not
only
tracks
the
ordinance
but
it
does
go
far
beyond
and
inhibits
also
some
other
action
which
however
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case.
but
primarily
we
say
this
is
an
effort
to
convert
an
ordinance,
the
violation
of
which
could
be
defended
in
a
trial
by
a
jury
on
the
ground
of
the
invalidity
of
the
injunction
just
by
giving
it
a
judicial
form,
the
defendants
have
been
deprived
to
both
those
rights.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
what
the
mine
workers
rule
was
intended
to
permit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
accompanied
with
two
or
three
--
i
forgot
affidavits
by
police
officials
of
the
city
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
are
in
the
record
and
annexed
to
the
complaint.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
could
have
been
done
in
the
injunction
mr.
justice
white,
but
by
tracking
the
language
of
the
ordinance
and
without
attempting
to
confine
it
to
the
sort
of
parade
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
had
been
held
in
previous
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
though
i
think
here
is
--
its
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
--
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white,
that
here
as
in
--
as
is
through
whole
first
amendment
cases,
this
petition
is
even
if
their
particular
conduct
might
have
been
reached
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
nevertheless
had
sending
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
tend
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
contempt
case
only
because
the
ordinance
was
put
into
judicial
language
without
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
kind
of
parade
described
in
the
application
mr.
justice
white
is
just
nothing
very
precise.
it
ranged
from
sit-ins
to
kneel-ins
to
parades
of
50
people,
to
parades
of
several
hundred
people.
and
indeed
the
alabama
court
of
appeal
found
that
a
parade
of
50
people
confined
at
the
sidewalk
did
not
require
a
permit,
whereas
the
parade,
a
larger
one
might.
now,
and
here,
these
petitioners
are
charged
with
engaging
in
two
parades,
the
one
on
good
friday
is
the
one
that
the
alabama
court
of
appeal
held
didn't
require
a
permit
at
all.
the
one
on
easter
sunday
being
a
larger
one,
probably
did
require
such
a
permit.
but
the
background
of
this
case
does
not
enlighten
the
scope
of
the
injunction
very
much,
i
would
say.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
argument
begins
with
the
premise
that
the
court
will
reach
the
mine
workers
issue
here.
in
saying
that
i
don't
mean
to
disparage
in
any
way
the
argument
which
has
been
made
that
there
is
a
threshold
question
whether
alabama
courts
had
tried
to
this
case,
applied
the
mine
workers'
doctrine
and
therefore
whether
they
may
bar
the
petitioners
from
arguing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
here
because
for
the
first
time,
they
did
invoke
that
doctrine.
there
is
it
seems
to
us
a
strong
argument
to
that
effect.
we
have
not
reached
that
point.
we
have
noted
it
in
our
brief.
we
leave
that
argument
to
the
petitioners
and
we
argue
only
the
question
most
interesting
to
the
united
states
that
most
far
reaching
which
is
the
application
of
the
mine
workers'
rule
in
this
sort
of
context
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
a
question
likely
to
be
reached
by
the
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
likely
to
be
reached
by
the
court
as
we
view
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
without
meaning
in
the
least
to
quarrel
with
but
a
question,
the
mine
workers
doctrine
properly
applied
in
circumstances
which
clearly
called
for
its
application.
we
do
think
it's
important
to
point
out
at
the
outset
what
a
remarkable
extraordinary
rule
it
is
in
some
respects.
it
does
allow
the
imposition
of
criminal
penalties
for
the
violation
of
a
court
order
which
by
definition
is
contrary
to
law
or
contrary
to
constitution.
now
that's
a
principle
rather
unique
in
our
law.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
commands
of
the
legislature
or
of
the
commands
of
the
executive
officers.
a
policeman
tells
someone
to
remain
or
to
move
on
and
that
order
is
improper
or
unconstitutional.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
there
can
be
no
penalty
for
violating
it.
likewise,
there
can
be
no
penalty
through
violating
a
void
statutory
law
nor
can
there
be
any
penalty
for
violating
the
order
of
a
legislative
committee
when
it
directs
a
witness
to
answer
and
he
has
a
constitutional
privilege
to
refuse
to
do
so.
now
in
saying
all
that,
we're
not
as
they
say
trying
to
disparage
the
rule,
we're
trying
to
find
the
reason
which
is
special
to
court
decrees
which
justifies
to
somewhat
harsh
absolute
principle
that
the
mine
workers
doctrine
embodies.
now
why
should
there
be
such
a
special
rule
applicable
only
to
court
orders?
it
seems
to
us
that
there
can
only
be
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
judicial
orders
oriented
in
a
particular
case
directed
against
the
particular
defendant
they
can
find
as
to
time
and
place
and
in
this
respect,
they're
different
from
general
laws
or
general
executive
regulations.
for
the
same
reason,
they're
less
likely
to
be
vulnerable
to
such
defenses
as
inapplicability
are
overbreadth.
demanding
obedience
to
court
orders
is
less
likely
to
cause
widespread
injury
than
blind
obedience
to
more
generalized
laws.
but
even
that
rational
doesn't
carry
us
all
the
way
because
there
is
the
same
specificity
in
a
policeman's
specific
directive
to
a
suspect
to
stop.
and
there
is
the
same
specificity
in
the
order
of
a
legislative
committee
to
witness
to
answer
a
particular
question.
so
there
must
be
another
reason
why
court
orders
are
especially
immune.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
reason
is
that
in
our
system,
courts
are
the
final
authority
with
respect
to
litigable
issues
to
concrete
controversy.
the
considered
judgments
of
courts
must
be
respected
since
they
are
the
final
authority
unless
we're
to
altogether
abandon
the
rule
of
law.
and
because
of
the
way
the
judicial
process
works,
because
courts
need
time
to
decide
cases,
there
are
temporary
stay
orders
to
preserve
the
case,
to
preserve
the
status
quo
must
also
be
respected.
now,
applying
those
rationales
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
important
respects,
they
don't
fit.
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
shipp
case
for
instance
in
which
this
court
had
issued
a
stay
order
pending
an
appeal
here
in
a
capital
conviction
from
a
state
court.
this
court,
in
order
to
give
itself
time
to
decide
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal,
stay
the
execution
of
the
defendant
who
had
been
convicted
and
not
withstanding
that
order,
the
prisoner
was
lynched
allegedly
as
it
was
ultimately
found
with
the
connivance
of
his
custodian,
the
local
sheriff.
that
action
wholly
mooted
the
case
and
prevented
the
judicial
process
from
working.
here
it
seems
to
us
we
have
rather
the
reverse
of
that
situation.
the
issuance
of
the
injunction,
if
it
must
be
obeyed,
mooted
the
legal
controversy.
because
for
all
practical
purposes,
this
parade,
this
march
or
these
marches,
could
not
be
postponed
indefinitely.
their
timing
was
important
in
the
context
of
birmingham
in
1963.
it
could
not
--
this
protest
could
not
serve
its
purpose
several
months
or
several
years
later
when
this
injunction
was
ultimately
vacated
on
appeal
perhaps
even
in
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
no.
i
think
this
court
has
i
think
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
donnovan
case,
they
may
not
lose
and
in
thomas
versus
collins,
texas
badly
did
not
follow
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
argument
is
the
first,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
due
process
clause
in
the
case
of
the
state
bars
a
state
from
applying
the
mine
workers
doctrine
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
prohibits
the
state
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
especially
in
light
of
the
first
amendment
rights
which
are
affected
on
the
other
side.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
ground
would
have
to
turn
on
its
unconstitutionality.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
wouldn't
argue
here
that
this
was
a
mere
procedural
rule
that
had
no
rational
and
no
basis
of
--
so
as
to
prevent
the
usual
defense.
i
think
we
do
rest
on
the
rationale
of
the
green
case
as
i
understand
it,
in
re
green
in
this
court
in
which
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
state
from
denying
the
defense
of
invalidity
with
respect
to
an
injunction
issued
by
a
court
in
an
area
which
was
preempted
by
federal
legislation.
here,
we
would
say
in
one
part
of
our
argument
that
in
--
something
of
the
same
sense
the
area
was
preempted
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
the
court,
state
court
here,
in
issuing
the
sort
of
broad,
overbroad
injunction
citing
first
amendment
rights
was
acting
unconstitutionally
beyond
its
jurisdiction
in
an
area
preempted
by
the
constitution,
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does
seem
to
me
mr.
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say
that
when
the
consequences
of
such
a
rule
are
so
serious
as
they
are
here
that
is
to
bar
the
expected
ability
to
defend
on
the
ground
of
the
invalidity
of
the
injunction.
if
we
assume
that
alabama
had
for
the
most
part
in
the
past,
allowed
in
a
contempt
proceeding,
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding,
the
defendant
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
the
injunction
was
improper
that
expectation
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
invention
of
a
new
rule
which
has
such
a
drastic
effect.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
holding
of
this
court
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
mr.
justice
white
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
in
anyway
the
argument
that
this
is
the
first
time
alabama
has
applied
this
rule
and
that
therefore,
it's
an
inadequate
state
ground
here.
i
do
begin
on
the
premise
however
that
there
is
some
question
about
that
and
that
the
court
may
have
to
reach
the
mine
workers
doctrine
that
that
is
the
question
which
concerns
most
directly
the
united
states.
it's
reason
for
participating
in
this
case.
and
therefore,
i'm
limiting
my
argument
to
it
without
really
taking
any
position
as
to
whether
the
court
must
reach
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
the
analysis
i
was
suggesting
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
might
explain
a
little
bit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
do
accept
those
rulings
of
this
court
which
shall
view
the
first
amendment
as
more
absolutely
preempting
from
state
courts
that
--
for
that
matter
from
federal
courts'
power
to
interfere
in
the
first
amendment
area
then
it's
true
with
respect
to
other
constitutional
guarantees.
i
don't
see
the
necessity
for
reaching
the
question
whether
the
same
principle
would
apply
elsewhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
recent
argument
mr.
justice
stewart
that
a
serious
jurisdic
--
serious
constitutional
inhibition
on
state
action,
court
action
or
whether
under
the
first
amendment
or
in
the
other
would
deprive
that
court
of
jurisdiction
to
act
and
that
therefore
the
same
argument
would
apply.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
something
does
depend,
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
the
specificity
of
the
constitutional
protection
on
the
clarity
with
which
one
can
say
in
advance
that
the
court
is
acting
beyond
its
power.
and
when
we're
dealing
in
the
area
of
the
ninth
or
the
tenth
amendment
that
becomes
far
more
difficult
and
debatable
and
therefore
the
--
perhaps
the
duty
to
obey
should
be
the
greater.
i
think
the
mine
workers
case
itself,
the
case
mr.
justice
franklin's
opinion
indicates
that
if
this
were
a
case
plainly
governed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
then
of
course,
disobedience
could
not
be
punished.
when
the
area
is
so
clearly
withdrawn,
i
think
that
was
the
rational
of
the
green
case
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
very
plainly
withdrawn
from
the
state
court's
old
power
in
this
area.
and
that
can
never
be
true
in
the
area
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
i
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
should
suppose
that
that
in
general
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
injunction
could
be
disobeyed
with
impunity
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
could
--
i
would,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so
mr.
justice
fortas.
however,
it
maybe
that
in
order
to
get
over
the
hurdle,
one
must
prove
that
the
injunction
is
plainly
invalid
and
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
case,
i
took
that
to
be
the
case
and
therefore
answer
the
question
as
it
is.
but
certainly,
analytically,
one
first
decides
whether
the
defense
is
available
and
then
tries
out
the
--
whether
the
defense
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
would
be
a
somewhat
different
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
because
here,
there
was
no
scheduling
of
a
hearing
on
the
merit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
recognized
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
there
is
a
strong
argument
that
even
in
the
situation
you
posed
because
it
is
an
unconstitutional
prior
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
which
is
with
exceptions
not
relevant
here
are
wholly
improper
at
least
when
we're
dealing
with
an
injunction
of
this
breadth
which
has
no
escape
now
that
it
prohibits
parades
of
--
at
any
time,
at
any
place
in
the
city
for
the
indefinite
future.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
there
was
not.
it
was
issued
ex
parte,
nine
o'clock
at
night
upon
the
application
of
the
city.
so
far
as
appears
the
application
was
made.
the
judge
ordered
the
injunction
to
issue,
the
clerk
did
issue
it
all
in
space
of
minutes
of
course
appears
without
any
hearing
and
notice
so
the
injunction
was
then
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
was
the
contempt
hearing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
contempt
hearing.
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
never
was
a
hearing
--
a
motion
to
dissolve
was
--
to
dissolve
the
injunction
was
filed
although
after
the
parades
involved
here
the
day
after,
the
monday,
the
last
parade
here
is
the
easter
sunday
parade.
and
the
petitioner
did
ask
that
that
motion
be
taken
up
first
rather
than
the
contempt
citation
which
was
filed
later
that
day.the
judge
reversed
the
order
of
the
questions,
never
reached
the
question
of
the
solution
and
filed
the
petitioners
in
contempt.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
we're
able
to
determine,
it
is
technically
still
pending
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
(inaudible)
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
that
motion?
there
was
on
the
day
when
the
--
in
facts,
when
the
motion
was
filed,
it
was
set
for
a
hearing
a
week
hence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
motion
to
dissolve.
on
the
day
--
oh,
that
same
day,
later
that
same
day,
this
was
monday,
the
april
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
monday
after
the
parade.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
citation
for
contempt
is
--
or
a
motion
to
add
the
--
petitioners
held
in
contempt
is
filed
in
that
city
and
it
was
set
for
the
same
day
a
week
hence.
when
that
day
came,
the
petitioner
is
asked
for
a
hearing
on
their
motion
to
dissolve
since
it
had
been
(inaudible).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
city
objected
it
and
the
court
shows
to
consider
the
contempt
first
and
never
reach
the
motion
to
dissolve
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
never
yet
reached
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
--
applying
the
mine
workers
rule
that
the
question
became
moot.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
we're
able
to
determine
under
alabama
law
the
injunction
is
still
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
none.
no.
as
we
understand
the
local
law
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
guess
that
it
maybe
the
burden
of
the
petitioners,
if
they
want
that
tro
dissolved
that
is
if
the
city
still
views
it
has
in
effect
then
have
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
but
i
suppose
that
they
are
free
to
come
into
court
at
anytime
that
have
been
for
sometime
in
ask
for
its
--
for
the
dissolution
of
that
tro
or
for
that
matter
to
appeal
it,
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
go
to
the
facts
of
this
case
since
--
and
i
don't
think
it's
my
burden
to
show
that
the
kind
of
parade
actually
held
was
protected.
i
don't
mean
to
question
that
one
way
or
the
other.
but
i
do
think
there
are
cases
in
this
court
which
hold
that
the
injunction
which
was
any
parade
that
held
or
any
other
at
any
time,
in
any
part
of
the
city,
under
any
circumstances
for
any
purpose,
that
the
cases
which
are
so
hold
or
cited
in
the
footnote
in
the
cox
case,
now
that
--
one
aspect
to
the
invalidity
of
this
injunction,
it's
overbreadth,
its
failure
to
provide
any
sort
of
temporizing
escape
though.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir,
i
don't
think
this
issue
has
ever
come
before
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
context.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
so
--
as
i
was
about
to
suggest
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
other
defect
and
the
more,
perhaps
the
clearer
defect
in
both
the
ordinance
and
the
injunction
which
does
nothing
more
than
repeat
the
ordinance
with
no
narrowing
whatever
is
precisely
the
permit
or
aspect
of
it.
it
allows
the
city,
its
commission
to
withhold
the
permit
on
a
series
of
grounds
which
amount
to
absolute
unconfined
discretion
in
the
city
to
grant
or
withhold
the
permit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
rule
in
this
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
as
i
understand
it
ever
since
thornhill
and
alabama
and
then
repeated
only
two
times
ago
in
cox
and
louisiana,
is
that
even
one
who
might
have
fully
asking
obtained
such
a
permit
has
standing
to
challenge
this
censorship
procedure
of
the
municipality.
that
whether
that
applies
to
parades,
or
to
meetings,
or
to
speech,
the
court
has
applied
it
in
all
of
those
instances.
in
cox
of
course
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
demonstration
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
--
with
special
safeguards,
there
maybe
some
licensing,
some
censorship
in
the
movie
area,
but
has
been
very
cautious
it
seems
to
me
to
confine
that
exception
both
narrowly
to
that
area
and
to
insist
in
subsequent
cases
that
there'd
be
as
many
safeguards
as
possible
and
that
there
not
be
any
greater
prior
restraint
without
hearing
than
is
necessary.
here
we're
dealing
with
the
ex
parte
order
and
not
a
considered
adjudication
after
adversary
hearing.
and
at
the
same
time,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
state
order
entered
to
preserve
the
status
quo
because
this
order
leaves
nothing
open
on
the
merits.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
meant
to
say
that
this
court
has
held
that
generally
and
perhaps
in
somewhat
other
--
somewhat
different
context
that
a
prior
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
with
the
exception
of
the
movie
area
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
is
forbidden.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
not
beyond
the
power
of
a
city
to
control
but
beyond
the
power
of
the
city
perhaps
to
forbid
all
together
under
all
circumstances
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
cox
case
amongst
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
cox
case
most
recently
indicated
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
an
absolute
ban
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
did
not.
no
sir.
but
it
did
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
i
say
the
--
i
don't
have
them
at
hand
but
the
cox's
opinion
in
suggesting
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
in
this
case,
we
not
only
have
what
seems
in
one
sense
like
a
complete
prohibition
on
all
parades
of
any
kind
whether
or
not
they
obstruct
traffic
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
can
only
reply
your
honor
back
to
the
cox
case
and
those
cited
on
the
footnote.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
--
the
cox
case
did
not
so
hold
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
any
case
specifically
so
holds
but
the
other
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
other
flaw
here,
mr.
justice
black
is
that
this
injunction
does
track
a
permit
ordinance
which
allows
the
city
officials
to
waive
this
bar
on
parades
whenever
they
choose
in
their
absolute
unconfined
discretion.
and
there
are
many
cases
in
this
court
which
hold
that
that
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
and
that
is
also
involved
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
unlike
cox
and
new
hampshire
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
no
narrowing
construction
of
the
permits
requirement
which
might
arguably
save
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
but
this
case
dates
from
april
1963
as
does
the
shuttlesworth
case
which
was
decided
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeal.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
still
not
decided
the
question
in
that
criminal
case
in
that
shuttlesworth
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
but
that
very
issue
was
decided
in
the
shuttlesworth
case.
the
alabama
court
of
appeal
itself
held
this
ordinance
unconstitutional
in
three
respects.
well,
unconstitutionally
in
two
respects
inapplicable
in
the
third.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
while
having
granted
certiorari
review,
that
decision
has
not
decided
it.
that
would
seem
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
the
appropriate
place
to
have
it
decided.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
an
indication
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
an
indication.
now,
i
frankly
--
i'm
not
such
an
expert
to
alabama
law
to
discuss
it
but
i
assume
that
to
be
the
thing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
injunction
is
reproduced
on
pages
four
and
five
of
our
brief,
reply
brief.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
congregating
on
the
street,
all
public
places
into
mobs,
all
public
places
into
mobs.
well,
that's
6th
line
down
on
page
5.
now,
we
don't
rely
on
that
portion
of
the
injunction
because
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
that's
directly
at
issue
here.
the
violation
charged
here
is
a
violation
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
simply
would,
and
we
do
point
to
the
--
of
--
in
if
--
as
we
understand
that
this
injunction
does
two
things.
it
says
first,
you
shall
not
violate
the
ordinance
--
the
permit,
parade
ordinance
of
the
city,
nor
shall
you
do
anything
else
unlawful.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
its
--
we
feel
compelled
to
that
argument
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
violation
of
the
injunction
charged
here
is
a
violation
of
that
part
of
the
injunction
which
track
the
ordinance.
the
reason
that
we
charge
contempt
does
not
rest
on
a
congregating
in
the
park
into
mobs.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no.
i
say
nothing
about
the
parade
itself
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
i
--
i'm
treating
the
injunction
as
severable
into
that
portion
which
covers
parades
and
that
portion
which
covers
other
activities.
i
maybe
wrong
in
that.
it
maybe
proper
to
treat
the
injunction
as
one
or
too
broad
in
addition
on
any
first
amendment
conduct
whether
it's
picketing
or
meeting
in
the
park,
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
--
perhaps
we
should
rely
on
it.
we
do
point
out
that
it
not
only
tracks
the
ordinance
but
it
does
go
far
beyond
and
inhibits
also
some
other
action
which
however
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case.
but
primarily
we
say
this
is
an
effort
to
convert
an
ordinance,
the
violation
of
which
could
be
defended
in
a
trial
by
a
jury
on
the
ground
of
the
invalidity
of
the
injunction
just
by
giving
it
a
judicial
form,
the
defendants
have
been
deprived
to
both
those
rights.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
what
the
mine
workers
rule
was
intended
to
permit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
accompanied
with
two
or
three
--
i
forgot
affidavits
by
police
officials
of
the
city
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
are
in
the
record
and
annexed
to
the
complaint.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
could
have
been
done
in
the
injunction
mr.
justice
white,
but
by
tracking
the
language
of
the
ordinance
and
without
attempting
to
confine
it
to
the
sort
of
parade
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
had
been
held
in
previous
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
though
i
think
here
is
--
its
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
--
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white,
that
here
as
in
--
as
is
through
whole
first
amendment
cases,
this
petition
is
even
if
their
particular
conduct
might
have
been
reached
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
nevertheless
had
sending
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
tend
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
contempt
case
only
because
the
ordinance
was
put
into
judicial
language
without
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
kind
of
parade
described
in
the
application
mr.
justice
white
is
just
nothing
very
precise.
it
ranged
from
sit-ins
to
kneel-ins
to
parades
of
50
people,
to
parades
of
several
hundred
people.
and
indeed
the
alabama
court
of
appeal
found
that
a
parade
of
50
people
confined
at
the
sidewalk
did
not
require
a
permit,
whereas
the
parade,
a
larger
one
might.
now,
and
here,
these
petitioners
are
charged
with
engaging
in
two
parades,
the
one
on
good
friday
is
the
one
that
the
alabama
court
of
appeal
held
didn't
require
a
permit
at
all.
the
one
on
easter
sunday
being
a
larger
one,
probably
did
require
such
a
permit.
but
the
background
of
this
case
does
not
enlighten
the
scope
of
the
injunction
very
much,
i
would
say.
