justice
abe
fortas
well,
may
i
ask
you
then
if
you
don't
mind,
the
--
as
i
remember
the
government's
brief
--
they
say
that
--
perhaps
i
am
mis
--
i
don't
want
to
misrepresent
their
view
but
i
think
they
--
i
had
the
impression
that
they
said
that
this
case
should
be
regarded
as
an
exception
to
the
mine
workers
doctrine,
would
you
phrase
it
that
way?
justice
abe
fortas
why,
because
it's
first
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
it'd
be
--
would
be
unfair,
do
you
mean
it'd
be
unfair
to
invoke
the
mine
workers
doctrine
here?
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
brief
and
the
reason
i
asked
you
about
the
government's
brief
is
that
you
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
an
identity
views.
but
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief
as
to
the
effect
that
--
if
you
apply
mine
workers
here,
then
the
contempt
order
is
valid
and
that
you
have
to
work
out
some
kind
of
an
exception,
the
mine
workers
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
injunction
or
not
the
type
of
situation
in
which
mine
workers
should
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
mine
workers
says.
justice
abe
fortas
in
toto
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
anything,
i
believe
that
were
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
claim
--
i
don't
get
this,
all
you're
asking
us
to
do
if
i
correctly
understand
your
brief,
can
i
call
your
attention
at
page
31,
is
that
--
you're
asking
that
the
--
you're
complaining
that
you
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
offer
proof
in
support
of
a
federal
constitutional
defense,
is
that
right?
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
we
would
do
--
what
we
would
do
if
i
understand
your
presentation
as
to
remand
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
not
technically
remand
the
case
but
to
send
it
back
so
that
there
would
be
a
hearing
and
the
evidence
would
be
receive
which
you
claimed
was
improperly
rejected?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
where
regardless
of
any
evidentiary
basis
which
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
you've
just
been
discussing
the
evidentiary
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
its
not
--
it
doesn't
make
it
bad
on
the
record
because
it's
--
the
record
is
not
here.
you're
saying
you
made
it
proffer?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
a
very
different
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
don't
you
have
to
say
a
little
more
mr.
greenberg,
perhaps
some
more?
you
have
to
say
that
the
petitioners
here
cannot
be
held
accountable
for
the
violation
of
an
injunction
on
the
basis
of
mine
workers
if
their
action
viewed
in
light
of
the
law
prior
to
the
law
in
this
case
was
justified
--
arguably
justified
because
of
alabama
law.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
really.
all
you're
talking
about
though
is
not
whether
the
injunction
can
be
disobeyed
with
impunity
but
whether
the
person
who
disobeys
the
injunction
has
the
right
to
have
his
claim
that
the
injunction
was
void
examined
by
the
court,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
there
are
two
questions,
two
hurdles
that
he
as
to
get
over.
one
is
the
united
mine
workers
case,
but
the
united
mine
workers
case
is
nothing
more
than
--
if
he
gets
over
that
that's
nothing
more
than
a
ticket
to
get
in
the
court
and
to
--
and
try
to
establish
that
the
injunction
is
void,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
the
fields
case?
justice
abe
fortas
in
alabama?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
do
you
have
the
alabama
citation?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
breckenridge,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
fields
against
city
of
fairfield?
justice
abe
fortas
in
that
case,
the
court
quoted
from
an
earlier
alabama
decision,
ex
parte
national
association
for
advancement
of
colored
people,
265
alabama.
and
then
a
part
forward
in
the
fields
case,
it
says
this.
it
is
only
where
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
of
the
proceeding.
or
where
on
the
face
of
it,
the
order
disobeyed
was
void.
or
where
procedural
requirements
with
respect
to
citation
for
a
contempt
and
the
like
were
not
observed.
or
where
the
fact
that
contempt
is
not
sustained
that
the
order
or
judgment
will
be
quashed.
that
was
a
contempt
case
like
this.
but
reading
that,
it
says
that
where
on
the
face
of
it
the
order
disobeyed
was
void.
it's
on
the
basis
of
that
plus
one
of
the
statements
in
the
fields
case
that
their
adversary
argues
that
the
voidness
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
order
permits
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
what
this
says
though.
where
--
this
says
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
where
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
where
the
order
was
void.
justice
abe
fortas
but
really
the
question,
the
question
is
whether
alabama
law
prior
to
its
decision
in
this
particular
case
permitted
the
use
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance
or
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
order
as
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
with
criminal
content.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
the
question
and
certainly
it's
a
position
that
seems
to
be
arguable
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
maybe
not
be
right
but
it's
arguable
in
any
rate
on
the
basis
of
the
language
in
fields.
justice
abe
fortas
but
still
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
but
a
criminal
contempt
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
sort
of
make
a
remark
that
the
--
on
its
face
the
statute
is
not
void
as
--
that's
a
--
remarked
to
be,
hasn't
it?
