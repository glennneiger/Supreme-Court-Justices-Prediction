mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
involves
a
wide-range
of
constitutional
issues
which
include
the
following
questions.
first,
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
parade
permit
ordinance,
second,
the
constitutionality
of
the
administration
of
that
ordinance,
and
then
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
to
establish
the
mode
of
this
administration.
the
validity
of
an
injunction
which
embodies
that
ordinance
in
toto
and
requires
parties
to
refrain
from
a
lengthy
enumerated
series
of
lawful
acts,
the
applicability
of
the
so-called
mine
workers
rule,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
one
may
litigate
first
in
the
alabama
courts,
and
second
in
this
court,
the
validity
of
a
permit
ordinance
and
the
validity
of
the
injunction
and
the
action
for
contempt,
the
constitutionality
of
the
finding
of
contempt
based
upon
statements
by
petitioners
expressing
outrage
at
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
and
the
validity
of
a
finding
of
contempt
against
certain
petitioners
against
--
on
whom
the
papers
had
not
been
served.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
would
submit
the
master
question
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
permit
ordinance
because
we
would
say
thereby
the
injunction
falls
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
first
amendment
questions
involved
in
this
type
when
it
affects
one's
speech,
the
so-called
mine
workers
rule
does
not
apply
and
we
have
--
there
are
reasons
in
state
law
where
the
mine
workers
rule
does
not
apply
also.
but
i
was
about
to
say
mr.
justice
harlan
that
while
it
would
be
impossible
to
discuss
within
30
minutes
--
because
it
will
be
impossible
to
discuss
within
30
minutes
all
of
these
issues,
all
of
which
are
rather
serious,
i
planned
to
focus
upon
--
but
one
or
two
of
them.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
in
an
amicus
brief
has
addressed
its
attention
exclusively
to
the
so-called
mine
workers
problem
and
the
position
in
their
brief
is
the
same
as
ours.
i
do
not
plan
to
discuss
that
question,
although
i
would
of
course
be
happy
to
answer
questions
concerning
it,
if
the
court
has
any.
the
issues
arise
out
of
incidents
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
might.
i
would
say
that
the
mine
workers
doctrine
was
not
to
or
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
a
situation
like
this
that
indeed
the
mine
workers
doctrine
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
not
only
because
it's
first
amendment,
because
of
the
circumstances
in
which
it
arose
because
of
the
nature
of
the
prior
restraint
haven't
--
of
the
injunction
having
been
issued
just
within
a
very
brief
period
of
time
before
the
march
was
supposed
to
commenced
because
of
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
we
face
--
we
might
just
posit
two-types
of
situations,
and
one
in
which
is
there's
merely
a
permit
ordinance
on
the
books
and
there
is
an
interest
in
regularity
of
enforcement,
an
interest
in
perhaps
applying
and
attempting
to
obtain
a
permit
under
that
ordinance.
yet
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases
that
if
that
cont
--
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
whereas
applied
one
may
violate
it
with
impunity.
on
the
other
hand,
we
might
posit
a
situation
in
which
we
might
assume
that
injunctions
ought
to
be
obeyed
until
they
are
litigated
and
disposed
of
on
the
injunction
rather
than
on
the
contempt.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
would
say
this
is
a
hybrid
situation
in
which
the
injunction
embodies
in
toto
the
ordinance
and
merely
transforms
the
mode
of
its
enforcement
from
ordinary
criminal
misdemeanor
proceedings
to
contempt
proceedings
and
we
would
argue
that
it
falls
in
the
permit
ordinance
type
category
of
cases
rather
than
the
other.
now
if
you
want
to
call
it
an
exception,
that's
possible
but
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
it's
a
different
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
one
would,
yes.
we
also
have
an
argument
which
i
think
is
--
which
we
would
submit
is
correct
and
that
is
that
under
alabama
law,
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
scope
of
reviewing
contempt
has
ever
been
so
narrowly
interpreted
that
in
the
case
of
fields
against
city
of
fairfield
which
came
to
this
court
and
was
reversed
on
no
evidence
grounds,
there
was
a
question
of
the
validity
of
a
permit
ordinance
involved.
the
alabama
supreme
court
appraised
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
then
appraised
the
validity
of
the
injunctive
order
passing
upon
the
merits
as
part
of
one
of
its
foregrounds
for
assessing
the
validity
of
the
contempt.
one
of
which
was
whether
the
injunction
was
on
its
face
void.
it
held
it
was
not
void
and
affirmed
the
contempt.
we
say
this
isn't
exactly
this
category,
and
in
a
speech's
state
ground
--
non-federal
ground
for
affirmance
was
given.
and
i
hope
to
come
to
that
in
a
few
moments
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
and
our
brief
as
well
mr.
justice
harlan,
merely
bec
--
well,
i'll
argue
it
if
i
can
get
to
it.
the
only
reason
i
was
trying
to
save
the
time
of
the
court,
i
do
believe
that
in
a
summary
argument,
that
there
were
a
number
of
important
things
i
had
to
say
in
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
believe
that
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
believe
this
is
an
adequate
thing
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
let
me
address
myself
to
it
then.
and
i
think
in
order
to
understand
the
context
--
the
mine
workers,
the
so-called
mine
workers
doctrine
and
the
other
issues
involved
in
this
case,
it's
important
to
see
the
context
in
which
this
case
arose
because
first
amendment
rights,
prior
restraint
questions,
questions
of
--
all
the
questions
involved
in
this
case
turn
on
the
context
of
the
situation,
the
enforcement
of
the
ordinance
and
so
forth.
this
case
--
issues
arose
on
an
incidence
which
occurred
four
years
ago
known
as
the
birmingham
demonstrations
of
1963
which
were
acknowledged
to
have
been
the
impetus
to
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
birmingham
at
that
time
was
a
virtually,
a
totally
segregated
community.
nine
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
board
of
education,
there
had
been
absolutely
no
school
desegregation.
fifteen
years
after
this
court's
decisions
in
sweatt
and
mclaurin
pursuant
to
state
policy,
the
university
of
alabama
remained
racially
segregated.
this
court's
decision
in
gober
against
city
of
birmingham
reflects
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
racial
segregation
ordinance
within
the
city
of
birmingham.
the
ordinary
channel
to
which
democratic
change
might
be
affected,
that
if
by
exercise
of
the
ballot
were
clogged,
only
11%
of
birmingham
negroes
were
able
to
vote
and
after
passage
of
the
1965
civil
rights
act,
the
rather
low
degree
of
negro
discretion
was
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
federal
registrars
were
sent
into
birmingham.
and
we
submit
that
the
first
amendment
claim
in
this
case
--
that
with
regards
to
the
first
amendment
claim
in
this
case
nothing
is
a
greater
testimonial
to
the
wisdom
and
utility
of
the
first
amendment
as
a
mechanism
for
affecting
change
democratically
than
the
fact
that
the
exercise
of
speech,
assembly
and
other
first
amendment
rights
in
birmingham
at
this
time
informed
the
conscience
of
the
nation
and
helped
changed
this
situation
not
only
in
birmingham
but
indeed
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
those
first
amendment
rights
were
not
exercised
without
opposition.
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
and
as
the
report
of
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission
indicates
which
is
quoted
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
it
said
that
street
demonstrations
were
regularly
suppressed
and
the
police
follow
that
policy
and
they
were
usually
supported
by
local
prosecutors
in
courts.
the
particular
facts
that
of
which
this
case
arose
were
as
follows.
these
demonstrations
were
part
of
the
series
that
began
on
early
april.
birmingham
has
a
parade
permit
ordinance
set
forth
and
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
4
which
ordinance
was
embodied
in
toto
into
the
injunction
in
this
case
and
it
stated
that
the
commission,
the
city
commission
will
grant
the
permit
for
parade
processions
or
other
public
demonstrations
unless
in
its
judgment
and
i
quote,
"for
public
welfare,
peace,
safety,
health,
decency,
good
order,
morals,
or
convenience
require
that
it
be
refused".
one
of
our
--
as
part
of
our
argument
we
submit
that
this
parade
permit
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
and
indeed,
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
arising
out
of
this
very
march
that's
involved
in
this
case
and
involving
one
of
the
very
petitioners
here,
held
that
ordinance
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
--
that's
not
all
we're
doing
mr.--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that
is
merely
--
we
make
a
series
of
arguments
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
merely
one
of
the
series
of
arguments.
we
also
argue
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
that
the
injunction
is
unconstitutional
--
unconstitutionally
vague
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
like
you
to
reverse
the
convictions
of
contempt
on
the
ground
that
they
are
based
upon
the
enforcement
of
an
unconstitutional
ordinance
embodied
into
an
unconstitutional
injunction.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
--
an
alternative
argument,
this
argument
on
page
31
that
you're
referring
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
now
on
april
3rd,
a
representative
--
petitioners
went
to
city
hall
to
inquire
about
getting
a
permit
and
she
said
she
went
to
mr.
connors's
office,
this
is
“bull”
connor
who
was
the
commissioner
of
public
safety
to
inquire
about
getting
a
permit
or
to
inquire
about
how
a
permit
might
be
obtained.
he
said,
"we
came
to
apply
to
see
about
getting
a
permit
for
picketing,
parading
and
demonstrating",
and
he
replied,
“no,
you
will
not
get
a
permit
in
birmingham,
alabama
to
picket.
i
will
picket
you
over
to
the
city
jail”.
and
she
said
he
repeated
that
twice.
he
did
not
inquire
about
the
names,
dates,
places,
numbers
or
anything
else,
which
might
be
pertinent
to
a
valid
enforcement
of
a
permit
ordinance.
several
days
later,
some
of
the
petitioners
sent
a
telegram
to
the
commissioner
and
asked
him
whether
they
can
have
a
permit
and
he
replied
back
and
said
“i
can't
give
you
one,
you
must
refer
this
to
the
entire
commission.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
ordinance
says
that.
but
then
at
the
trial,
there
was
an
effort
to
attempt
that
that
in
fact
was
not
the
procedure
that
in
fact
the
permits
were
issued
by
the
city
clerk
on
the
recommendation
of
the
traffic
division
which
was
under
the
police
commissioner
and
all
those
proffers
were
refused.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
our
position
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
but
if
the
evidence
had
been
--
has
been
allowed,
it
would
have
developed
that
as
the
record
shows
that
in
fact
this
ordinance
was
enforced
in
quite
a
different
way
that
it
was
in
--
that
the
city
commission
in
fact
had
never
granted
a
parade
permit.
that
the
parade
permits
were
be
granted
by
the
city
clerk
on
the
recommendation
of
a
subordinate
of
commissioner
connor.
and
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
that
would
make
quite
another
story
if
that
were
established
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
we're
trying
to
prove
that
that
wasn't
true
and
that
wasn't
permitted.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
the
--
that
the
commissioner
was
sending
these
petitioners
to
a
procedure
that
all
other
citizens
of
birmingham
not
have
to
follow,
that
it
was
a
discriminatory
enforcement.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
any
event,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
--
we
would
submit
that
it
--
it
makes
it
bad
on
the
record
though
mr.
justice
white,
because
the
injunction
remitted
us
to
amend
whom
--
who
might
kick
one
of
the
representatives
of
petitioners
out
of
the
door
and
then
center
on
a
runaround
to
follow
a
commission
that
--
a
procedure
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
no
one
else
would
follow
or
had
to
follow.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
as
to
the
aspect
of
a
case
that
relates
the
proffer,
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
on
that.
as
to
the
aspect
of
the
case
that
relates
to
the
constitutional
--
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
we
would
submit
that
if
this
court
finds
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional,
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
its
face,
we
--
this
ordinance
we
submit
is
very
much
like
almost
--
it
literally
in
some
force
is
like
the
ordinance
and
stab
new
facts.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
wouldn't
even
say
that
vagueness
was
out
of
this
mr.
justice
white
because
one
of
the
--
the
things
about
his
record
that
is
rather
clear
is
that
there
was
an
effort
to
conduct
all
of
these
walks
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
jack
greenberg
with
the
thought
that
it
would
not
come
under
the
ordinance
and
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
dealing
with
this
incident
in
a
criminal
case
has
held
that
certainly,
this
doesn't
apply
to
the
sidewalk.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
court
were
not
to
agree
with
us
on
the
question
of
the
constitution
--
that
the
vagueness
of
the
injunction
and
of
the
ordinance,
then
certainly
these
convictions
could
not
be
affirmed
without
an
evidentiary
record.
if
we
establish
the
evidence
that
we
proffer,
then
of
course
we
submit
that
the
charter
should
be
dismissed.
demonstrations
continued
in
birmingham
and
the
complaint
filed
against
the
petitioners
alleged
that
they
were
sit-in
demonstrations
at
privately
owned
businesses
and
this
court
subsequently
held
they
could
not
be
punished.
in
the
gober
case,
there
was
alleged
parades
without
a
permit,
petitioners
filed
affidavits
in
response
to
this
saying
that
they
were
walking
on
the
sidewalk
and
this
is
not
something
which
a
permit
was
necessary.
they
were
contemplated
though
apparently
never
occurred
the
so-called
kneel-ins
at
churches
and
then
there
were
a
great
many
arrest
during
this
period
of
time.
i
might
inform
the
court
that
now
pending
approximately
1500
cases
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
in
birmingham
awaiting
final
disposition
either
of
this
case
or
of
the
shuttlesworth
case
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeals.
about
seven
to
eight
hundred
were
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions
in
gober
and
ham
(ph),
and
about
1100
juvenile
cases
were
dismissed
with
no
reason
being
given.
and
then
about
50
to
60
people
paid
fines
and
--
so
those
cases
were
disposed
off.
the
city
catalogued
these
occurrences
in
a
complaint
filed
at
9:00
p.m.
on
wednesday
april
10th,
asking
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
all
so-called
unlawful
demonstrations
and
parading
without
a
permit.
without
notice,
without
hearing,
the
circuit
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
forbidding
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
--
there's
--
not
in
the
abstract,
but
i
think
we're
dealing
here
with
a
first
amendment
context
and
assessing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
and
assessing
the
validity
of
contempt
convictions
i
think
that
that
all
adds
up
to
the
general
repressive
atmosphere
and
the
way
this
type
--
these
proceedings
were
being
used
in
the
city
of
birmingham.
essentially,
this
tro
is
granted
the
night
--
on
the
affidavit
of
“bull”
connor
who
were
requesting
the
court
to
remit
the
petitioners
back
to
“bull”
connor
if
they
wanted
a
march.
after
he
had
told
them
that,
“i
will
picket
you
to
the
city
jail”,
and
we
would
submit
that
this
is
not
that
kind
of
--
this
is
not
a
mine
workers
case
be
it
called
exception
or
otherwise.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
ten
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
harlan
principally
where
they
go
to
the
very
core
of
the
case.
and
they
relate
to
the
mine
workers
issue.
to
its
significance
to
this
case
and
to
the
position,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
take
with
regard
to
the
issue.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
whether
it
was
not
the
threshold
issue
and
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
court
faces
the
problem
of
whether
it
can
reach
the
validity
of
the
injunction
on
review
of
the
judgment
of
content.
but
it
is
not
the
issue
in
the
sense
that
the
court
must
reach
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
state
can
invoke
the
mine
workers
issue
as
a
bar
to
entertaining
first
amendment
defenses.
the
court
can
reach
the
mine
workers
issue
but
it
doesn't
have
to
as
it
did
not
for
example
in
thomas
versus
collins
in
which
under
state
law,
the
state
courts
could
have
and
did
pass
upon
the
validity
of
the
injunction
in
the
action
for
contempt.
and
that,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
the
difference
between
our
position
and
the
government's.
the
government
argues
mine
workers
exclusively
and
we
come
here
sensitive
to
a
concern
that
the
court
may
think
it
inappropriate
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
of
such
great
importance
if
that
question
is
not
inescapable.
and
therefore,
the
major
thrust
of
our
argument
is
to
demonstrate
that
that
maybe
done
while
the
court
can
reverse
without
reaching
mine
workers
we
submit
however
it
cannot
affirm
without
reaching
it.
and
i
should
like
to
mention
several
grounds
on
which
the
court
may
reverse
without
reaching
the
mine
workers
issue.
now
the
alabama
state
supreme
court
gave
what
purported
to
be
an
adequate
state
ground
for
affirmance.
but
we
submit
that
heretofore;
state
law
did
not
embody
mine
workers.
the
alabama
state
courts
gave
its
reason
for
refusal
to
review
the
judgment
of
contempt
as
two
things.
one,
the
court
below
was
a
court
of
equity.
and
two,
they
would
service
upon
the
parties.
however
in
no
case
heretofore
has
alabama
law
embodied
this
as
the
sole
grounds
in
reviewing
a
judgment
of
contempt.
for
example,
in
fields
against
city
of
fairfield,
as
i
tried
to
point
out
yesterday,
there
was
at
issue
almost
precisely
the
issues
that
are
here
in
this
case.
there
was
the
question
of
the
validity
of
a
permit
ordinance
which
was
alleged
to
give
discretion
far
too
broad
and
vague
to
administrators.
there
was
the
validity
of
the
injunction
embodying
that
ordinance.
the
petitioners
in
that
case
went
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
the
state
supreme
court
examined
the
injunction
on
a
number
of
grounds.
disjunctively,
it
looked
that
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
order
was
void.
in
determining
whether
the
order
was
void,
the
state
supreme
court
examined
the
permit
ordinance
and
examined
the
injunction.
and
then
it
said
that
they
--
the
permit
ordinance
and
the
injunction
are
valid
and
it
proceeded
to
affirm.
this
court
then
reversed
it
on
other
grounds.
in
our
case,
they
did
not
examine
whether
the
order
was
void
in
the
same
sense
that
they
did
examine
whether
it
was
void
in
the
fields
case.
and
we
submit
that
alabama
law
having
heretofore
quite
clearly
embodied
that
type
of
review,
we
were
entitled
to
that
kind
of
view
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
consequently,
there
was
not
an
adequate
state
ground
for
refusal
to
review.
now
the
fields
case
is
not
a
mutation
or
a
sport
in
alabama
law.
alabama
courts
have
consistently
gone
beyond
the
two
narrow
grounds
that
they've
given
in
our
case.
in
a
case
involving
indeed
another
party
to
this
case,
commissioner
connor,
in
re
connor
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
alabama
courts
looked
at
whether
or
not
the
injunctive
order
was
too
vague.
and
they
stated
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
ground
for
reviewing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
in
a
contempt
action.
and
in
a
very
early
alabama
case
also
set
forth
and
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
the
alabama
--
merrill
--
board
of
review
versus
merrill,
the
alabama
courts
looked
at
whether
or
not
the
court
of
equity
had
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
they
were
proper
substantive
allegations
in
the
complaint
of
fraud,
corruption,
and
bad
faith
dealing
with
the
board
of
review
--
board
of
revenue.
and
it
said
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
a
review
of
the
contempt
action.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
issue,
the
injunction
and
consequently
have
reversed.
now
this,
we
submit,
is
something
that
the
alabama
courts
could
have
done
here
under
settled
alabama
law.
and
therefore
this
ground
is
available
to
this
court
because
as
this
court
has
done
in
thomas
versus
collins,
and
da
--
donovan
versus
dallas,
and
other
cases
in
which
it
has
reviewed
the
validity
of
the
injunction
and
the
contempt
action
if
that
ground
was
available
in
state
law
that
should
have
been
available
to
us
here.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
did
apply
the
mine
workers
rule
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
and
significantly,
they
cited
no
alabama
case.
they
cited
mine
workers
for
the
first
time
but
i
would
--
we
suggest
that
on
this
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
federal
question
is
properly
here,
i
think
it's
a
question
properly
for
this
court
as
in
--
let
us
say
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
one
might
have
said
that
the
state
could
have
changed
its
law
as
of
that
point
but
these
courts
had
petitioners
who
were
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
preexisting
law
in
raising
the
federal
question.
and
indeed
we
did
in
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
did
pass
upon
the
validity
of
the
injunction.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
we
would
submit
--
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
in
numerous
cases
in
this
court
that
when
a
procedural
rule
is
changed
for
the
first
time
as
a
bar
to
raising
a
federal
question
this
court
does
not
consider
it
a
bar
to
review
of
that
question
here.
there
was
the
--
the
petitioners
had
good
reasons
to
believe
that
they
could've
raised
that
question
and
presented
that
issue
in
the
alabama
courts
and
indeed
the
trial
court
to
some
extent
gave
it
--
its
holding
was
perhaps
an
alternative
ground.
they
did
pass
upon
the
validity
of
injunction.
they
cited
cox
against
new
hampshire
saying,
this
ordinance
is
okay.
see
cox
against
new
hampshire.
and
the
alabama
state
supreme
court
did
nothing
and
say
we've
got
a
court
of
equity
and
we
serve
the
parties
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now
we
submit
that
we
are
not
therefore
barred
from
bringing
this
question
here
via
that
route.
now
we
would
like
to
suggest
another
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
we
have
said
that.one
of
our
problems
is
that
there's
so
many
things
to
say
in
this
case.
it's
impossible
to
say
them
all
at
once.
but
clearly,
we
would
submit
that
it
does
not
take
very
much
argument
in
this
court
to
establish
that
we
did
have
here
an
unconstitutional
ordinance.
and
it
was
embodied
in
an
injunction
which
was
perhaps
more
unconstitutional
than
the
ordinance
if
that
were
possible.
and
peti
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
unquestionably,
ordinances
which
are
embody
some
of
this
very
same
standard,
general
welfare
and
so
forth
have
been
held
unconstitution,
stab
the
backs
in
many
other
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
true.
and
that
brings
us
to
another
ground
while
we
submit
the
court
need
not
reach
the
mine
workers
question
in
this
case.
though
if
the
court
were
to
reach
the
mine
workers
question,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
ought
to
there
--
go
directly
to
the
merits.
but
we're
aware
of
many
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
this
is
something
that
the
court
does
--
not
likely
and
we're
trying
to
in
argument
offer
to
the
court
certain
considerations
why
it
doesn't
have
to
go.
if
it
did,
we
would
say
the
court
ought
to
reverse.
and
we
were
precluded
from
making
a
record
which
would
demonstrate
just
what
remitting
us
to
bull
connor
would
mean.
and
we
would
say
that
before
the
court
should
make
a
decision
on
a
question
like
that
of
rather
far
reaching
constitutional
importance
to
what
extent
can
a
first
--
can
first
amendment
rights
be
frustrated
by
the
issuance
of
an
injunction.
we
would
say
that
the
court
ought
to
understand
the
full
implications
of
doing
something
like
that.
constitutional
decisions
frequently
avoid
a
non
--
if
the
record
is
not
complete,
their
case
--
it
say
then,
if
the
case
comes
up
in
a
demurrer
and
so
forth
and
we
here
would
have
wanted
too
and
try
to
make
a
complete
record
showing
just
what
an
injunction
meant
which
embodies
an
ordinance
which
says,
“go
work
it
out
with
bull
connor",
and
we
will
prevent
it
from
doing
that.
and
we
would
submit
that
as
an
additional
ground
why
the
court
--
on
which
the
court
may
decide
this
case
without
reaching
mine
workers.
the
court
would
have
a
full
record
before
it.
but
if
it
does
reach
mine
workers,
we
would
submit
that
it
ought
to
go
to
the
merits
and
reverse.
i
have
a
minute
left,
i
would
like
to,
if
the
court
please,
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court
in
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
reply
to
a
certain
questions
that
were
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
never
heard,
these
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
still
pending.
mr.
jack
greenberg
still
pending.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
move
to
have
the
motion
to
dissolve,
heard
our
opponents,
move
to
have
the
motion
of
contempt
heard.
the
city
and
the
judge
insisted
upon
going
ahead
on
the
motion
of
contempt.
we
said
the
motion
to
dissolve
should
be
heard
first
and
we
want
a
time
to
sue
out
a
writ
of
prohibition
to
have
that
established
in
the
state
supreme
court.
the
trial
court
refused
to
give
us
time,
insisted
in
going
ahead
on
the
contempt
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
was
not
heard.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
never
pressed
it
thereafter
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
had
set
a
time
for
hearing,
yes
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
mean
he
set
a
time
for
hearing
subsequently.
subsequent
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
he
said
it
for
i
think
some
date
in
may
actually.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
he
did
set
it
for
the
22nd
but
on
the
22nd
was
the
day
that
both
the
contempt
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
came
up.
he
did
set
a
time
for
hearing.
they
both
came
up
the
same
day.
we
said,
“ours
was
filed
first.
we
thought
it
ought
to
be
heard
first.
it
was
prior".
the
courts
said,
"well,
i'm
going
to
hear
the
contempt
first".
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
just
have
one
minute?
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
about
fields
versus
city
of
fairfield
and
i
would
like
to
say
the
language
he
quoted
is
on
page
52
of
our
brief.
but
in
addition
to
that
language,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
injunction
and
did
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
ordinance
and
treated
with
the
mine
workers
question
as
going
to
jurisdiction
in
the
disjunctive.
and
therefore
we
claim
that
the
merits
of
the
injunction
and
the
ordinance
were
there.
justice
black
asked,
whether
or
not,
mr.
claiborne
and
i
assume
the
same
question
applied
to
us
would
agree
that
the
municipality
can
regulate
the
streets
and
perhaps
under
some
circumstances
prohibit
use
of
the
streets.
and
certainly
we
would
concede
that
that
is
the
case.
no
one
denies
that
but,
we
think
the
law
is
clear
that
it
must
be
done
under
precise
standards,
and
it
must
be
done
on
the
basis
of
equality.
the
quality
is
to
all
and
i
think
that
is
our
position
in
the
case.
there
has
been
some
mention,
mr.
justice
black
of
the
facts
of
the
demonstrations.
that
however
was
never
an
issue
below.
the
only
thing
was
in
issue
was,
was
there
a
permit?
and
in
fact,
the
police
testified
that
the
marchers
and
the
onlookers
were
separate.
the
police
had
cleared
out
the
area.
there
was
no
vehicular
traffic
in
the
area.
there
were
no
white
people
in
the
area.
any
disorder
that
occurred
with
the
three
or
four
arrest
were
not
in
the
marchers,
there
were
other
people.
the
police
testified
that
they
could
have
obtained
assistance
if
they
needed
it
from
a
sheriff's
office
or
the
state
police
but
they
did
not
need
it
and
did
not
seek
to
get
it.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
there
was
mr.
justice
black.
on
a
number
of
occasions,
on
april
3rd
and
on
april
5th
prior
to
this
date,
efforts
to
obtain
permits
were
met
by
consistent
rebuffs
including
bull
connor
saying
when
it
--
when
someone
came
into
him,
one
of
the
commissioners,
mr.
breckenridge
stated
that
two
commissioners
could
grant
a
permit.
they
went
to
one
of
the
two.
certainly
that
was
proper
and
said,
“how
do
i
go
about
getting
a
permit
to
a
parade
in
birmingham?”
and
he
said,
“get
out
of
here.
i'll
picket
you
to
the
city
jail,
you
won't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
commissioner
connor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mrs.
lola
hendricks,
who
was
a
rep
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mrs.
lola
hendricks
who
was
a
representative
of
defendant
shuttlesworth
and
of
the
alabama
christian
movement
for
human
rights
did
that.
and
it
so
appears
in
the
record
and
it's
described
in
that
manner.
she
was
accompanied
by
a
baptist
minister
when
she
went
there.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
said
i
will
--
you
--
no,
you
will
not
get
a
permit
to
picket
in
the
streets
of
birmingham.
i
will
picket
you
to
the
city
jail.
she
not
only
asked
him
for
a
permit,
she
also
asked
him
how
do
i
go
about
by
getting
one.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
involves
a
wide-range
of
constitutional
issues
which
include
the
following
questions.
first,
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
parade
permit
ordinance,
second,
the
constitutionality
of
the
administration
of
that
ordinance,
and
then
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
to
establish
the
mode
of
this
administration.
the
validity
of
an
injunction
which
embodies
that
ordinance
in
toto
and
requires
parties
to
refrain
from
a
lengthy
enumerated
series
of
lawful
acts,
the
applicability
of
the
so-called
mine
workers
rule,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
one
may
litigate
first
in
the
alabama
courts,
and
second
in
this
court,
the
validity
of
a
permit
ordinance
and
the
validity
of
the
injunction
and
the
action
for
contempt,
the
constitutionality
of
the
finding
of
contempt
based
upon
statements
by
petitioners
expressing
outrage
at
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
and
the
validity
of
a
finding
of
contempt
against
certain
petitioners
against
--
on
whom
the
papers
had
not
been
served.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
would
submit
the
master
question
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
permit
ordinance
because
we
would
say
thereby
the
injunction
falls
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
first
amendment
questions
involved
in
this
type
when
it
affects
one's
speech,
the
so-called
mine
workers
rule
does
not
apply
and
we
have
--
there
are
reasons
in
state
law
where
the
mine
workers
rule
does
not
apply
also.
but
i
was
about
to
say
mr.
justice
harlan
that
while
it
would
be
impossible
to
discuss
within
30
minutes
--
because
it
will
be
impossible
to
discuss
within
30
minutes
all
of
these
issues,
all
of
which
are
rather
serious,
i
planned
to
focus
upon
--
but
one
or
two
of
them.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
in
an
amicus
brief
has
addressed
its
attention
exclusively
to
the
so-called
mine
workers
problem
and
the
position
in
their
brief
is
the
same
as
ours.
i
do
not
plan
to
discuss
that
question,
although
i
would
of
course
be
happy
to
answer
questions
concerning
it,
if
the
court
has
any.
the
issues
arise
out
of
incidents
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
might.
i
would
say
that
the
mine
workers
doctrine
was
not
to
or
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
a
situation
like
this
that
indeed
the
mine
workers
doctrine
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
not
only
because
it's
first
amendment,
because
of
the
circumstances
in
which
it
arose
because
of
the
nature
of
the
prior
restraint
haven't
--
of
the
injunction
having
been
issued
just
within
a
very
brief
period
of
time
before
the
march
was
supposed
to
commenced
because
of
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
we
face
--
we
might
just
posit
two-types
of
situations,
and
one
in
which
is
there's
merely
a
permit
ordinance
on
the
books
and
there
is
an
interest
in
regularity
of
enforcement,
an
interest
in
perhaps
applying
and
attempting
to
obtain
a
permit
under
that
ordinance.
yet
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases
that
if
that
cont
--
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
whereas
applied
one
may
violate
it
with
impunity.
on
the
other
hand,
we
might
posit
a
situation
in
which
we
might
assume
that
injunctions
ought
to
be
obeyed
until
they
are
litigated
and
disposed
of
on
the
injunction
rather
than
on
the
contempt.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
would
say
this
is
a
hybrid
situation
in
which
the
injunction
embodies
in
toto
the
ordinance
and
merely
transforms
the
mode
of
its
enforcement
from
ordinary
criminal
misdemeanor
proceedings
to
contempt
proceedings
and
we
would
argue
that
it
falls
in
the
permit
ordinance
type
category
of
cases
rather
than
the
other.
now
if
you
want
to
call
it
an
exception,
that's
possible
but
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
it's
a
different
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
one
would,
yes.
we
also
have
an
argument
which
i
think
is
--
which
we
would
submit
is
correct
and
that
is
that
under
alabama
law,
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
scope
of
reviewing
contempt
has
ever
been
so
narrowly
interpreted
that
in
the
case
of
fields
against
city
of
fairfield
which
came
to
this
court
and
was
reversed
on
no
evidence
grounds,
there
was
a
question
of
the
validity
of
a
permit
ordinance
involved.
the
alabama
supreme
court
appraised
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
then
appraised
the
validity
of
the
injunctive
order
passing
upon
the
merits
as
part
of
one
of
its
foregrounds
for
assessing
the
validity
of
the
contempt.
one
of
which
was
whether
the
injunction
was
on
its
face
void.
it
held
it
was
not
void
and
affirmed
the
contempt.
we
say
this
isn't
exactly
this
category,
and
in
a
speech's
state
ground
--
non-federal
ground
for
affirmance
was
given.
and
i
hope
to
come
to
that
in
a
few
moments
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
and
our
brief
as
well
mr.
justice
harlan,
merely
bec
--
well,
i'll
argue
it
if
i
can
get
to
it.
the
only
reason
i
was
trying
to
save
the
time
of
the
court,
i
do
believe
that
in
a
summary
argument,
that
there
were
a
number
of
important
things
i
had
to
say
in
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
believe
that
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
believe
this
is
an
adequate
thing
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
let
me
address
myself
to
it
then.
and
i
think
in
order
to
understand
the
context
--
the
mine
workers,
the
so-called
mine
workers
doctrine
and
the
other
issues
involved
in
this
case,
it's
important
to
see
the
context
in
which
this
case
arose
because
first
amendment
rights,
prior
restraint
questions,
questions
of
--
all
the
questions
involved
in
this
case
turn
on
the
context
of
the
situation,
the
enforcement
of
the
ordinance
and
so
forth.
this
case
--
issues
arose
on
an
incidence
which
occurred
four
years
ago
known
as
the
birmingham
demonstrations
of
1963
which
were
acknowledged
to
have
been
the
impetus
to
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
birmingham
at
that
time
was
a
virtually,
a
totally
segregated
community.
nine
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
board
of
education,
there
had
been
absolutely
no
school
desegregation.
fifteen
years
after
this
court's
decisions
in
sweatt
and
mclaurin
pursuant
to
state
policy,
the
university
of
alabama
remained
racially
segregated.
this
court's
decision
in
gober
against
city
of
birmingham
reflects
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
racial
segregation
ordinance
within
the
city
of
birmingham.
the
ordinary
channel
to
which
democratic
change
might
be
affected,
that
if
by
exercise
of
the
ballot
were
clogged,
only
11%
of
birmingham
negroes
were
able
to
vote
and
after
passage
of
the
1965
civil
rights
act,
the
rather
low
degree
of
negro
discretion
was
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
federal
registrars
were
sent
into
birmingham.
and
we
submit
that
the
first
amendment
claim
in
this
case
--
that
with
regards
to
the
first
amendment
claim
in
this
case
nothing
is
a
greater
testimonial
to
the
wisdom
and
utility
of
the
first
amendment
as
a
mechanism
for
affecting
change
democratically
than
the
fact
that
the
exercise
of
speech,
assembly
and
other
first
amendment
rights
in
birmingham
at
this
time
informed
the
conscience
of
the
nation
and
helped
changed
this
situation
not
only
in
birmingham
but
indeed
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
those
first
amendment
rights
were
not
exercised
without
opposition.
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
and
as
the
report
of
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission
indicates
which
is
quoted
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
it
said
that
street
demonstrations
were
regularly
suppressed
and
the
police
follow
that
policy
and
they
were
usually
supported
by
local
prosecutors
in
courts.
the
particular
facts
that
of
which
this
case
arose
were
as
follows.
these
demonstrations
were
part
of
the
series
that
began
on
early
april.
birmingham
has
a
parade
permit
ordinance
set
forth
and
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
4
which
ordinance
was
embodied
in
toto
into
the
injunction
in
this
case
and
it
stated
that
the
commission,
the
city
commission
will
grant
the
permit
for
parade
processions
or
other
public
demonstrations
unless
in
its
judgment
and
i
quote,
"for
public
welfare,
peace,
safety,
health,
decency,
good
order,
morals,
or
convenience
require
that
it
be
refused".
one
of
our
--
as
part
of
our
argument
we
submit
that
this
parade
permit
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
and
indeed,
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
arising
out
of
this
very
march
that's
involved
in
this
case
and
involving
one
of
the
very
petitioners
here,
held
that
ordinance
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
--
that's
not
all
we're
doing
mr.--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that
is
merely
--
we
make
a
series
of
arguments
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
merely
one
of
the
series
of
arguments.
we
also
argue
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
that
the
injunction
is
unconstitutional
--
unconstitutionally
vague
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
like
you
to
reverse
the
convictions
of
contempt
on
the
ground
that
they
are
based
upon
the
enforcement
of
an
unconstitutional
ordinance
embodied
into
an
unconstitutional
injunction.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
--
an
alternative
argument,
this
argument
on
page
31
that
you're
referring
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
now
on
april
3rd,
a
representative
--
petitioners
went
to
city
hall
to
inquire
about
getting
a
permit
and
she
said
she
went
to
mr.
connors's
office,
this
is
“bull”
connor
who
was
the
commissioner
of
public
safety
to
inquire
about
getting
a
permit
or
to
inquire
about
how
a
permit
might
be
obtained.
he
said,
"we
came
to
apply
to
see
about
getting
a
permit
for
picketing,
parading
and
demonstrating",
and
he
replied,
“no,
you
will
not
get
a
permit
in
birmingham,
alabama
to
picket.
i
will
picket
you
over
to
the
city
jail”.
and
she
said
he
repeated
that
twice.
he
did
not
inquire
about
the
names,
dates,
places,
numbers
or
anything
else,
which
might
be
pertinent
to
a
valid
enforcement
of
a
permit
ordinance.
several
days
later,
some
of
the
petitioners
sent
a
telegram
to
the
commissioner
and
asked
him
whether
they
can
have
a
permit
and
he
replied
back
and
said
“i
can't
give
you
one,
you
must
refer
this
to
the
entire
commission.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
ordinance
says
that.
but
then
at
the
trial,
there
was
an
effort
to
attempt
that
that
in
fact
was
not
the
procedure
that
in
fact
the
permits
were
issued
by
the
city
clerk
on
the
recommendation
of
the
traffic
division
which
was
under
the
police
commissioner
and
all
those
proffers
were
refused.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
our
position
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
but
if
the
evidence
had
been
--
has
been
allowed,
it
would
have
developed
that
as
the
record
shows
that
in
fact
this
ordinance
was
enforced
in
quite
a
different
way
that
it
was
in
--
that
the
city
commission
in
fact
had
never
granted
a
parade
permit.
that
the
parade
permits
were
be
granted
by
the
city
clerk
on
the
recommendation
of
a
subordinate
of
commissioner
connor.
and
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
that
would
make
quite
another
story
if
that
were
established
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
we're
trying
to
prove
that
that
wasn't
true
and
that
wasn't
permitted.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
the
--
that
the
commissioner
was
sending
these
petitioners
to
a
procedure
that
all
other
citizens
of
birmingham
not
have
to
follow,
that
it
was
a
discriminatory
enforcement.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
any
event,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
--
we
would
submit
that
it
--
it
makes
it
bad
on
the
record
though
mr.
justice
white,
because
the
injunction
remitted
us
to
amend
whom
--
who
might
kick
one
of
the
representatives
of
petitioners
out
of
the
door
and
then
center
on
a
runaround
to
follow
a
commission
that
--
a
procedure
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
no
one
else
would
follow
or
had
to
follow.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
as
to
the
aspect
of
a
case
that
relates
the
proffer,
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
on
that.
as
to
the
aspect
of
the
case
that
relates
to
the
constitutional
--
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
we
would
submit
that
if
this
court
finds
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional,
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
its
face,
we
--
this
ordinance
we
submit
is
very
much
like
almost
--
it
literally
in
some
force
is
like
the
ordinance
and
stab
new
facts.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
wouldn't
even
say
that
vagueness
was
out
of
this
mr.
justice
white
because
one
of
the
--
the
things
about
his
record
that
is
rather
clear
is
that
there
was
an
effort
to
conduct
all
of
these
walks
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
jack
greenberg
with
the
thought
that
it
would
not
come
under
the
ordinance
and
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
dealing
with
this
incident
in
a
criminal
case
has
held
that
certainly,
this
doesn't
apply
to
the
sidewalk.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
court
were
not
to
agree
with
us
on
the
question
of
the
constitution
--
that
the
vagueness
of
the
injunction
and
of
the
ordinance,
then
certainly
these
convictions
could
not
be
affirmed
without
an
evidentiary
record.
if
we
establish
the
evidence
that
we
proffer,
then
of
course
we
submit
that
the
charter
should
be
dismissed.
demonstrations
continued
in
birmingham
and
the
complaint
filed
against
the
petitioners
alleged
that
they
were
sit-in
demonstrations
at
privately
owned
businesses
and
this
court
subsequently
held
they
could
not
be
punished.
in
the
gober
case,
there
was
alleged
parades
without
a
permit,
petitioners
filed
affidavits
in
response
to
this
saying
that
they
were
walking
on
the
sidewalk
and
this
is
not
something
which
a
permit
was
necessary.
they
were
contemplated
though
apparently
never
occurred
the
so-called
kneel-ins
at
churches
and
then
there
were
a
great
many
arrest
during
this
period
of
time.
i
might
inform
the
court
that
now
pending
approximately
1500
cases
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
in
birmingham
awaiting
final
disposition
either
of
this
case
or
of
the
shuttlesworth
case
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeals.
about
seven
to
eight
hundred
were
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions
in
gober
and
ham
(ph),
and
about
1100
juvenile
cases
were
dismissed
with
no
reason
being
given.
and
then
about
50
to
60
people
paid
fines
and
--
so
those
cases
were
disposed
off.
the
city
catalogued
these
occurrences
in
a
complaint
filed
at
9:00
p.m.
on
wednesday
april
10th,
asking
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
all
so-called
unlawful
demonstrations
and
parading
without
a
permit.
without
notice,
without
hearing,
the
circuit
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
forbidding
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
--
there's
--
not
in
the
abstract,
but
i
think
we're
dealing
here
with
a
first
amendment
context
and
assessing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
and
assessing
the
validity
of
contempt
convictions
i
think
that
that
all
adds
up
to
the
general
repressive
atmosphere
and
the
way
this
type
--
these
proceedings
were
being
used
in
the
city
of
birmingham.
essentially,
this
tro
is
granted
the
night
--
on
the
affidavit
of
“bull”
connor
who
were
requesting
the
court
to
remit
the
petitioners
back
to
“bull”
connor
if
they
wanted
a
march.
after
he
had
told
them
that,
“i
will
picket
you
to
the
city
jail”,
and
we
would
submit
that
this
is
not
that
kind
of
--
this
is
not
a
mine
workers
case
be
it
called
exception
or
otherwise.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
ten
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
harlan
principally
where
they
go
to
the
very
core
of
the
case.
and
they
relate
to
the
mine
workers
issue.
to
its
significance
to
this
case
and
to
the
position,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
take
with
regard
to
the
issue.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
whether
it
was
not
the
threshold
issue
and
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
court
faces
the
problem
of
whether
it
can
reach
the
validity
of
the
injunction
on
review
of
the
judgment
of
content.
but
it
is
not
the
issue
in
the
sense
that
the
court
must
reach
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
state
can
invoke
the
mine
workers
issue
as
a
bar
to
entertaining
first
amendment
defenses.
the
court
can
reach
the
mine
workers
issue
but
it
doesn't
have
to
as
it
did
not
for
example
in
thomas
versus
collins
in
which
under
state
law,
the
state
courts
could
have
and
did
pass
upon
the
validity
of
the
injunction
in
the
action
for
contempt.
and
that,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
the
difference
between
our
position
and
the
government's.
the
government
argues
mine
workers
exclusively
and
we
come
here
sensitive
to
a
concern
that
the
court
may
think
it
inappropriate
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
of
such
great
importance
if
that
question
is
not
inescapable.
and
therefore,
the
major
thrust
of
our
argument
is
to
demonstrate
that
that
maybe
done
while
the
court
can
reverse
without
reaching
mine
workers
we
submit
however
it
cannot
affirm
without
reaching
it.
and
i
should
like
to
mention
several
grounds
on
which
the
court
may
reverse
without
reaching
the
mine
workers
issue.
now
the
alabama
state
supreme
court
gave
what
purported
to
be
an
adequate
state
ground
for
affirmance.
but
we
submit
that
heretofore;
state
law
did
not
embody
mine
workers.
the
alabama
state
courts
gave
its
reason
for
refusal
to
review
the
judgment
of
contempt
as
two
things.
one,
the
court
below
was
a
court
of
equity.
and
two,
they
would
service
upon
the
parties.
however
in
no
case
heretofore
has
alabama
law
embodied
this
as
the
sole
grounds
in
reviewing
a
judgment
of
contempt.
for
example,
in
fields
against
city
of
fairfield,
as
i
tried
to
point
out
yesterday,
there
was
at
issue
almost
precisely
the
issues
that
are
here
in
this
case.
there
was
the
question
of
the
validity
of
a
permit
ordinance
which
was
alleged
to
give
discretion
far
too
broad
and
vague
to
administrators.
there
was
the
validity
of
the
injunction
embodying
that
ordinance.
the
petitioners
in
that
case
went
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
the
state
supreme
court
examined
the
injunction
on
a
number
of
grounds.
disjunctively,
it
looked
that
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
order
was
void.
in
determining
whether
the
order
was
void,
the
state
supreme
court
examined
the
permit
ordinance
and
examined
the
injunction.
and
then
it
said
that
they
--
the
permit
ordinance
and
the
injunction
are
valid
and
it
proceeded
to
affirm.
this
court
then
reversed
it
on
other
grounds.
in
our
case,
they
did
not
examine
whether
the
order
was
void
in
the
same
sense
that
they
did
examine
whether
it
was
void
in
the
fields
case.
and
we
submit
that
alabama
law
having
heretofore
quite
clearly
embodied
that
type
of
review,
we
were
entitled
to
that
kind
of
view
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
consequently,
there
was
not
an
adequate
state
ground
for
refusal
to
review.
now
the
fields
case
is
not
a
mutation
or
a
sport
in
alabama
law.
alabama
courts
have
consistently
gone
beyond
the
two
narrow
grounds
that
they've
given
in
our
case.
in
a
case
involving
indeed
another
party
to
this
case,
commissioner
connor,
in
re
connor
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
alabama
courts
looked
at
whether
or
not
the
injunctive
order
was
too
vague.
and
they
stated
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
ground
for
reviewing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
in
a
contempt
action.
and
in
a
very
early
alabama
case
also
set
forth
and
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
the
alabama
--
merrill
--
board
of
review
versus
merrill,
the
alabama
courts
looked
at
whether
or
not
the
court
of
equity
had
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
they
were
proper
substantive
allegations
in
the
complaint
of
fraud,
corruption,
and
bad
faith
dealing
with
the
board
of
review
--
board
of
revenue.
and
it
said
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
a
review
of
the
contempt
action.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
issue,
the
injunction
and
consequently
have
reversed.
now
this,
we
submit,
is
something
that
the
alabama
courts
could
have
done
here
under
settled
alabama
law.
and
therefore
this
ground
is
available
to
this
court
because
as
this
court
has
done
in
thomas
versus
collins,
and
da
--
donovan
versus
dallas,
and
other
cases
in
which
it
has
reviewed
the
validity
of
the
injunction
and
the
contempt
action
if
that
ground
was
available
in
state
law
that
should
have
been
available
to
us
here.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
did
apply
the
mine
workers
rule
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
and
significantly,
they
cited
no
alabama
case.
they
cited
mine
workers
for
the
first
time
but
i
would
--
we
suggest
that
on
this
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
federal
question
is
properly
here,
i
think
it's
a
question
properly
for
this
court
as
in
--
let
us
say
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
one
might
have
said
that
the
state
could
have
changed
its
law
as
of
that
point
but
these
courts
had
petitioners
who
were
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
preexisting
law
in
raising
the
federal
question.
and
indeed
we
did
in
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
did
pass
upon
the
validity
of
the
injunction.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
we
would
submit
--
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
in
numerous
cases
in
this
court
that
when
a
procedural
rule
is
changed
for
the
first
time
as
a
bar
to
raising
a
federal
question
this
court
does
not
consider
it
a
bar
to
review
of
that
question
here.
there
was
the
--
the
petitioners
had
good
reasons
to
believe
that
they
could've
raised
that
question
and
presented
that
issue
in
the
alabama
courts
and
indeed
the
trial
court
to
some
extent
gave
it
--
its
holding
was
perhaps
an
alternative
ground.
they
did
pass
upon
the
validity
of
injunction.
they
cited
cox
against
new
hampshire
saying,
this
ordinance
is
okay.
see
cox
against
new
hampshire.
and
the
alabama
state
supreme
court
did
nothing
and
say
we've
got
a
court
of
equity
and
we
serve
the
parties
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now
we
submit
that
we
are
not
therefore
barred
from
bringing
this
question
here
via
that
route.
now
we
would
like
to
suggest
another
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
we
have
said
that.one
of
our
problems
is
that
there's
so
many
things
to
say
in
this
case.
it's
impossible
to
say
them
all
at
once.
but
clearly,
we
would
submit
that
it
does
not
take
very
much
argument
in
this
court
to
establish
that
we
did
have
here
an
unconstitutional
ordinance.
and
it
was
embodied
in
an
injunction
which
was
perhaps
more
unconstitutional
than
the
ordinance
if
that
were
possible.
and
peti
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
unquestionably,
ordinances
which
are
embody
some
of
this
very
same
standard,
general
welfare
and
so
forth
have
been
held
unconstitution,
stab
the
backs
in
many
other
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
true.
and
that
brings
us
to
another
ground
while
we
submit
the
court
need
not
reach
the
mine
workers
question
in
this
case.
though
if
the
court
were
to
reach
the
mine
workers
question,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
ought
to
there
--
go
directly
to
the
merits.
but
we're
aware
of
many
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
this
is
something
that
the
court
does
--
not
likely
and
we're
trying
to
in
argument
offer
to
the
court
certain
considerations
why
it
doesn't
have
to
go.
if
it
did,
we
would
say
the
court
ought
to
reverse.
and
we
were
precluded
from
making
a
record
which
would
demonstrate
just
what
remitting
us
to
bull
connor
would
mean.
and
we
would
say
that
before
the
court
should
make
a
decision
on
a
question
like
that
of
rather
far
reaching
constitutional
importance
to
what
extent
can
a
first
--
can
first
amendment
rights
be
frustrated
by
the
issuance
of
an
injunction.
we
would
say
that
the
court
ought
to
understand
the
full
implications
of
doing
something
like
that.
constitutional
decisions
frequently
avoid
a
non
--
if
the
record
is
not
complete,
their
case
--
it
say
then,
if
the
case
comes
up
in
a
demurrer
and
so
forth
and
we
here
would
have
wanted
too
and
try
to
make
a
complete
record
showing
just
what
an
injunction
meant
which
embodies
an
ordinance
which
says,
“go
work
it
out
with
bull
connor",
and
we
will
prevent
it
from
doing
that.
and
we
would
submit
that
as
an
additional
ground
why
the
court
--
on
which
the
court
may
decide
this
case
without
reaching
mine
workers.
the
court
would
have
a
full
record
before
it.
but
if
it
does
reach
mine
workers,
we
would
submit
that
it
ought
to
go
to
the
merits
and
reverse.
i
have
a
minute
left,
i
would
like
to,
if
the
court
please,
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court
in
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
reply
to
a
certain
questions
that
were
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
never
heard,
these
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
still
pending.
mr.
jack
greenberg
still
pending.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
move
to
have
the
motion
to
dissolve,
heard
our
opponents,
move
to
have
the
motion
of
contempt
heard.
the
city
and
the
judge
insisted
upon
going
ahead
on
the
motion
of
contempt.
we
said
the
motion
to
dissolve
should
be
heard
first
and
we
want
a
time
to
sue
out
a
writ
of
prohibition
to
have
that
established
in
the
state
supreme
court.
the
trial
court
refused
to
give
us
time,
insisted
in
going
ahead
on
the
contempt
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
was
not
heard.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
never
pressed
it
thereafter
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
had
set
a
time
for
hearing,
yes
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
mean
he
set
a
time
for
hearing
subsequently.
subsequent
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
he
said
it
for
i
think
some
date
in
may
actually.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
he
did
set
it
for
the
22nd
but
on
the
22nd
was
the
day
that
both
the
contempt
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
came
up.
he
did
set
a
time
for
hearing.
they
both
came
up
the
same
day.
we
said,
“ours
was
filed
first.
we
thought
it
ought
to
be
heard
first.
it
was
prior".
the
courts
said,
"well,
i'm
going
to
hear
the
contempt
first".
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
just
have
one
minute?
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
about
fields
versus
city
of
fairfield
and
i
would
like
to
say
the
language
he
quoted
is
on
page
52
of
our
brief.
but
in
addition
to
that
language,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
injunction
and
did
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
ordinance
and
treated
with
the
mine
workers
question
as
going
to
jurisdiction
in
the
disjunctive.
and
therefore
we
claim
that
the
merits
of
the
injunction
and
the
ordinance
were
there.
justice
black
asked,
whether
or
not,
mr.
claiborne
and
i
assume
the
same
question
applied
to
us
would
agree
that
the
municipality
can
regulate
the
streets
and
perhaps
under
some
circumstances
prohibit
use
of
the
streets.
and
certainly
we
would
concede
that
that
is
the
case.
no
one
denies
that
but,
we
think
the
law
is
clear
that
it
must
be
done
under
precise
standards,
and
it
must
be
done
on
the
basis
of
equality.
the
quality
is
to
all
and
i
think
that
is
our
position
in
the
case.
there
has
been
some
mention,
mr.
justice
black
of
the
facts
of
the
demonstrations.
that
however
was
never
an
issue
below.
the
only
thing
was
in
issue
was,
was
there
a
permit?
and
in
fact,
the
police
testified
that
the
marchers
and
the
onlookers
were
separate.
the
police
had
cleared
out
the
area.
there
was
no
vehicular
traffic
in
the
area.
there
were
no
white
people
in
the
area.
any
disorder
that
occurred
with
the
three
or
four
arrest
were
not
in
the
marchers,
there
were
other
people.
the
police
testified
that
they
could
have
obtained
assistance
if
they
needed
it
from
a
sheriff's
office
or
the
state
police
but
they
did
not
need
it
and
did
not
seek
to
get
it.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
there
was
mr.
justice
black.
on
a
number
of
occasions,
on
april
3rd
and
on
april
5th
prior
to
this
date,
efforts
to
obtain
permits
were
met
by
consistent
rebuffs
including
bull
connor
saying
when
it
--
when
someone
came
into
him,
one
of
the
commissioners,
mr.
breckenridge
stated
that
two
commissioners
could
grant
a
permit.
they
went
to
one
of
the
two.
certainly
that
was
proper
and
said,
“how
do
i
go
about
getting
a
permit
to
a
parade
in
birmingham?”
and
he
said,
“get
out
of
here.
i'll
picket
you
to
the
city
jail,
you
won't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
commissioner
connor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mrs.
lola
hendricks,
who
was
a
rep
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mrs.
lola
hendricks
who
was
a
representative
of
defendant
shuttlesworth
and
of
the
alabama
christian
movement
for
human
rights
did
that.
and
it
so
appears
in
the
record
and
it's
described
in
that
manner.
she
was
accompanied
by
a
baptist
minister
when
she
went
there.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
said
i
will
--
you
--
no,
you
will
not
get
a
permit
to
picket
in
the
streets
of
birmingham.
i
will
picket
you
to
the
city
jail.
she
not
only
asked
him
for
a
permit,
she
also
asked
him
how
do
i
go
about
by
getting
one.
thank
you.
