what
would
make
the
statute
(inaudible)?
justice

unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
that
the
injunction
hearing
though
or
the
contempt
hearing
--
over
that
time
you
know
that
your
conduct
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
the
ordinance
and
the
injunction
you
are
compelling
to
proscribe
and
there's
--
the
vagueness
is
out
of
it
--
maybe
overbreadth
this,
but
the
vagueness
is
out
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
seems
to
me
they
go
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
about
it
maybe
an
evidentiary
record
if
we
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
apply
the
mine
workers
rule
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
instead
--
it
was
alabama
law
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
free
as
--
a
state
is
free
to
change
its
policy,
to
change
its
rule
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
were
entitled
to
raise
it
in
the
--
in
this
court
to
raise
the
federal
question
but
here
the
state
supreme
court
has
already
said
that
this
is
the
rule
of
alabama.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
your
claim,
what
about
the
rule,
a
statement
--
a
rule
that
a
state
applies
in
some
case
that
that
this
doesn't
apply
in
other
cases?
it's
a
sort
of
what
--
sometime
thing
--
sort
of
a
discretionary
rule.
sometimes
they
do
and
sometimes
they
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
adequate
state
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that
you
don't
go
--
since
you
argued
the
constitutionality
to
feel
you
must
argue
it.
and
if
you
don't
stop
short
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
--
the
motion
is
still
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean,
you
mean
there's
no
time
limit
on
tros
and
--
in
alabama?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
responsible
for
then
--
whose
responsible
then
for
calling
up
more
hearings
on
the
permanent
injunction,
on
the
validity
of
the
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
right
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
that
the
cases
in
this
court
which
you
--
in
which
you
think
show
that
the
kind
of
grades
that
were
held
here
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
indicates
--
does
it
indicate
that
the
overbreadth
issue
maybe
raised
in
a
contempt
hearing
like
it
may
in
a
--
on
the
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
i
--
in
you're
brief,
you
seem
to
indicate
this
injunction
not
only
covered
parades
and
gatherings
in
connection
with
streets.
but
did
it
cover
demonstrations
or
assemblies
of
any
kind,
anywhere.
now
that's
not
so,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
said
this
--
where
is
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let's
assume
they
had
a
very
large
meeting
in
the
park,
is
that
enjoined
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps
if
it
were
true
that
it
covered
all
--
that
this
sort
of
thing
that
would
be
an
example
of
overbreadth,
wasn't
it
on
which
you
relied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
right
as
to
the
coverage
of
the
injunction,
it's
far
broader
than
the
ordinance
then
and
yet
you
say
it
really
distracts
the
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
mean
you
--
you
mean
you
--
you
must
testify
the
--
the
actual
permit
parade
that
you
held,
that
your
clients
held,
or
that
these
people
--
that
the
petitioners'
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
saying
just
--
are
you
really
saying
this
is
invalid
because
of
--
it
might
cover
some
other
kinds
of
parades?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
your
--
if
it's
overbreadth
you
rely
on,
i
don't
know
why
you
wouldn't
rely
on
that.
and
if
you
can't
rely
on
it,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
rely
on
overbreadth
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
--
were
the
certiorari
of
--
was
the
petition
or
the
complaint
filed?
was
it
accompanied
with
any
affidavits?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
they're
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
injunction
was
any
kind
of
an
adjudication
or
a
construction
of
the
ordinance
namely
that
at
least
the
permit
requirement
covers
the
kinds
of
parades
that
the
petitioners
were
engaged
in.
and
that
at
least
these
parades
required
a
permit.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it's
the
only
way
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
only
way
you're
inured
though
is
that
--
is
with
respect
to
the
parade
you
wanted
to
--
or
that
the
petitioners
want
to
propose.
and
--
so
it's
solely
an
overbreadth
that
you
rest,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
parade
is
somewhat
--
body
else
might
want
to
hold
or
some
other
kinds
of
parades
that
you
might
want.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
except
a
contempt
case
here.
you
haven't
got
a
--
that's
to
me
is
in
a
little
bit
different
light.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
--
but
it
was
suggested
by
the
issuance
--
the
temporary
injunction
that
this
particular
kind
of
parade
described
in
the
affidavits
and
whatnot
required
a
permit.
then
you
created
again.
and
there
was
--
then
there
was
a
contempt
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
these
photographs
pictures
of
the
easter
parade
or
some
other
parade?
justice

these

they

they

were
these

that
they're
defined.

justice
byron

you
mean
permits.
justice
byron

white
what
would
make
the

justice
byron

unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron

white
well,
what
if
that
the
injunction
hearing
though
or
the
contempt
hearing
--
over
that
time
you
know
that
your
conduct
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
the
ordinance
and
the
injunction
you
are
compelling
to
proscribe
and
there's
--
the
vagueness
is
out
of
it

maybe
overbreadth
this,
but
the
vagueness
is
out
of
it?
justice
byron

that
doesn't
(voice

justice
byron

well,
this
seems
to
me
they
go
to
mr.

about

a
statement

a
rule
that
a
