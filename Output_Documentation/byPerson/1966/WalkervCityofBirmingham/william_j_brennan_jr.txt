justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
mr.
claiborne
say
having
reached
it?
that
a
--
the
rational
agreement
which
was
that
because
congress
had
enacted
legislation
in
this
area
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
to
issue
the
injunction
allegedly
there
violated.
that
similarly
here,
not
because
there's
any
legislation
but
because
of
the
first
amendment
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
if
the
ordinance
violates
this
amendment
principles,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
to
issue
this
injunction
enjoining
violation
of
the
ordinance.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
example,
a
good
(voice
overlap)
--
suppose
what
had
happened
here
was
this
that
the
application
was
made
for
the
injunction.
and
the
petitioners
here
had
gone
to
the
trial
court
and
said,
“now,
we
want
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
the
validity
under
the
federal
constitution
of
this
ordinance.”
and
the
trial
judge
said,
“i
think
that's
right.
i
think
you
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
and
we'll
schedule
a
full
hearing
on
that
for
next
week
if
you
can
bring
in
all
your
witnesses,
we'll
hear
oral
argument
and
otherwise
--
but
meanwhile,
i
don't
think
you
should
demonstrate
and
i'm
issuing
a
restraining
order,
tro
and
come
back
here
next
week,
we'll
have
a
full
hearing.”
would
you
still
be
making
--
the
government
still
be
making
the
argument
to
this?
and
then
he
defend,
the
trial
judge
concluded
after
the
full
hearing
in
and
everything
else
that
no,
he
doesn't
find
any
merit
in
the
constitutional
arguments,
and
he
sustains
the
validity
of
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
no
but
if
--
as
i
understood
what
you
said
earlier,
the
ordinance
if
unconstitutional
establishes
a
jurisdictional
defect
in
any
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
issue
an
injunction
order
enforcing
that
ordinance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
incidentally
what
actually
happened
here,
the
application
as
i
recall
that
the
--
the
permit
--
a
permit
was
refused
by
commissioner
connor
then
the
application
was
made
or
was
there
any
kind
of
hearing
before
the
trial
judge,
before
the
interim
restraint
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
