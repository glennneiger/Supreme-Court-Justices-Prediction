mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
into
coming
on
is
the
bona
fide
of
the
so-called
full
birmingham
demonstration
from
1963
which
have
been
mentioned
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
connection
they
have
unless
they
imply
that
the
principle
was
lofty
that
it
justifies
a
violation
of
a
direct
court
injunction
or
decree.
but
i
would
assume
that
any
municipality
like
birmingham
demonstrations
of
this
nature
would
be
aimed
at
the
hope
of
convincing
the
local
government
to
change
some
law
or
some
procedure.
now
let's
see
what
these
defendants
did.
they
mounted
by
outsiders
the
defendant's
majority
were
outsider.
they
come
in
to
the
city
of
birmingham
at
a
time
when
the
people
of
the
city
of
birmingham
had
voted
to
change
its
form
of
government.
now,
who
has
the
deciding
vote
in
that
election?
the
majority
of
the
voters
who
voted
for
the
new
form
of
government
were
negros.
and
they
voted
overwhelming
for
the
new
form
of
government.
they
have
had
had
an
election.
commissioner
connor
had
run
against
mayor
boutwell,
and
mayor
boutwell
had
won
the
election.
and
they
started
these
demonstrations
in
april,
first
of
april
1963.
and
under
the
law,
the
new
form
of
government
went
into
--
they
took
office
on
april
15th.
now
who
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
election
day
was
several
months
before
that
because
they
had
to
have
a
change
in
qualifying
the
candidates.
i
think
probably
eight
--
seven
to
eight
months
along
the
(inaudible).
i
don't
have
the
exact
date.
but
they
had
changed
the
form
of
government,
candidates
had
qualified.
they've
elected
a
council
of
nine
and
they
had
elected
a
mayor.
and
they
were
take
place,
take
office
on
april
15th.
they
started
these
demonstrations
when
the
old
government
was
in
there.
i
don't
know
what
they
expected
them
to
do
or
what
they
--
would
have
been
reasonable
to
expect.
i
don't
know
what
the
purpose
was.
but
they
started
at
a
time;
it
would
seem
to
me
reasonable
to
have
waited,
to
not
have
started
it.
but
they
started
it.
now
they
had
--
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
somewhat
over
40
meetings.
we
have
never
contended
that
we
have
in
any
way
interfered
with
freedom
of
speech.
this
injunction
ordered
the
city,
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
testifies
that
he'd
been
over
20
meetings
and
there'd
been
many
more
that
mounting
this
campaign.
there
had
been
usurpation
of
the
streets
prior
to
this
that
matters
in
this
injunction.
if
you
read
the
affidavits
on
the
complaint
you
have
seen
that
there
was
possible
disorders
in
the
streets
of
birmingham
which
might
occur
and
with
the
change
in
government
and
the
possible
disorders,
and
the
fight
that
the
court
has
authority
to
issue
an
injunction
to
hold
a
status
quo
and
determine
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
are
to
modify
the
injunction
or
to
give
the
right
or
to
require
the
city
governing
body
to
let
them
parade.
they
chose
not
to
follow
that
injunction.
they
chose
to
disobey
it.
not
because
we're
vague
and
uncertain,
of
course,
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
enjoined
but
to
select
certain
things.
they
were
definite
in
that.
instead
of
these,
we
will
disobey.
we
will
march.
we
will
--
we
want
everybody
to
come
in
and
help
us
march.
that's
the
effect
of
it,
and
they
did
do
it.
and
the
injunction
citation
was
obtained.
all
they
had
to
do
under
alabama
law
was
file
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction
and
to
modify
it.
they
could
have
had
a
hearing
in
a
few
days.
and
the
time,
there
was
nothing
urgent
about
these
demonstrations
about
the
timing
because
the
timing,
it
should
have
been
waited
until
a
new
government
took
place.
now
what
happened
on
april
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
they
have
raised
the
question
of
the
--
the
other
parties
the
--
appellants
have
raised
the
question
of
the
urgency
of
the
situation
and
the
timing
of
the
demonstration.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that's
right.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
they
want
to
have
it.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
that
is
correct.
and
of
course
they
applied
--
they
didn't
apply
to
the
governing
body
for
a
permit.
they
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
gotten
it
or
not.
i
do
know
that
they
have
been
since
a
new
form
of
government
has
taken
over,
i
know
of
no
denial
of
a
permit
for
any
parade
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
this
was
the
old
government.
now,
the
new
government
came
in
--
on
april
15th
and
the
old
government
refused
to
vacate.
so
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case
we
had
two
municipal
governments
in
city
hall
and
the
evidence
indicates
that
it
had
only
one
isolated
incidence
for
it
--
incidence
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
motion
of
--
dissolution
i
believe
mr.
mcbee
mentioned
that
this
came
first
and
that
they
have
not
moved
to
set
it
down
because
this
was
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
permits
for
parades
have
all
been
--
have
been
granted
by
the
new
form
of
government
whenever
they
were
asked
for.
and
since
the
decision
of
alabama
court
of
appeals
we
have
elected
in
view
of
that
decision
not
to
prosecute
anybody
for
parading
under
these
ordinance
without
a
permit,
awaiting
on
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
determine.
now,
what
i
was
saying
about
the
situation,
the
one
instance
in
situation
that
shows
the
confusion,
not
the
confusion
but
the
situation
in
the
city
hall
and
mr.
shorz
(ph)
question
to
mr.
connor
--
when
mr.
connor
he
says,
“you
are
commissioner
mr.
connor.”
answer;
“uh-huh."
former
commissioner
--
mr.
shorz
(ph)
says,
"former
commission
of
the
city
of
birmingham?"
“yes”,
as
mr.
connor's
answer.
then
he
says,
“did
you
say
former
commissioner?
i
am
commissioner.”
so
you
can
see
that
we
had
a
time
in
birmingham
when
this
had
to
be
handled
delicately
and
properly.
now,
we
think
that
the
record
shows
that
it
was,
that
there
was
no
first
amendment
involved
in
this
case.
they
had
all
the
meetings
they
wanted
to.
they
had
all
the
hearings.
they
could
have
gotten
permits.
they
did
get
permits
after
the
new
government
came
in.
this
same
group
got
permits
to
parade
and
got
them.
now
we
submit
that
there's
no
first
amendment
freedom
in
this
case.
and
i
say
this
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
i
say
we
submit
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
case
issue
in
this
case.
they
claim
there
is
as
i
understand
them.
our
opponents
claim
there
is
a
first
amendment
by
saying
to
--
to
modify
united
mine
workers,
to
accept
first
amendment.
it
matter
so
that
in
this
--
so
they
evidently
assume
that
this
case
involved
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
has
never
given
the
people
the
right
to
usurp
the
streets.
freedom
of
speech
as
mr.
douglas,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
thomas
versus
collins,
no
one
may
be
required
to
attain
a
license
in
order
to
speak,
and
we
certainly
agree
with
it.
but
once
he
uses
the
economic
power
which
he
has
in
all
the
means,
this
was
the
(inaudible)
case.
and
these
--
and
their
jobs
to
influence
their
action,
he
is
doing
more
than
exercising
the
freedom
of
speech
protected
by
the
constitution.
now
we
said
take
that
same
argument,
same
reasoning,
and
say
that
once
they
get
in
the
streets,
and
use
the
streets
so
as
to
inconvenience
of
other
people
and
to
divert
their
use,
they're
using
more
than
pure
speech.
and
that
this
case
involves
the
use
of
the
streets.
it
has
in
it
before
this
court
for
the
first
time,
a
clear
cut
statement
of
the
theory
that
we
do
not
obey
a
law
which
we
believe
unjust
which
horrors
right
to
the
fundamental
thought
of
the
governing
of
a
society.
it
has
that
in
there,
a
statement
and
it
has
it
put
into
practice
in
refusing
to
obey
an
injunction.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that
was
a
statement
of
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
put
out
by
martin
luth
--
at
this
press
conference.
that
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that's
in
cities
--
complainants
--
wait
a
minute,
cities
of
–
exhibit
2,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
it
is
in
the
--
in
several
places
in
it
but
--
alright.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
this
is
just
at
--
now,
at
page
410
of
the
record
says
just
as
an
old
good
conscience,
we
cannot
obey
unjust
laws
neither
can
we
respect
the
unjust
use
of
the
courts.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
this
is
a
statement
put
out
by
--
this
was
a
news
release.
it
has
written
statement
by
m.
l.
king
jr.,
f.
l.
shuttlesworth,
ralph
abernathy
et
al.
for
engaging
in
peaceful
desegregation
demonstrations.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
established
practice.
i
would
deny
that
there
were
times
when
probably
a
permit
was
issued
by
the
city
clerks.
whether
they
--
if
it
were
issued,
it
was
issued
without
authority
of
law
or
ordinance
and
had
it
--
had
the
approval
of
(inaudible)
ours
has
been
referred
too,
we
would
require
that
it'd
be
by
the
governing
body
as
we
did
require
later
that
it'd
be
by
the
city
council.
and
in
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
the
new
city
code,
we
have
changed
that
and
in
adopting
a
new
city
code
in
which
we
have
completely
taken
out
a
many
ordinances
that
were
claimed
objectionable.
we
have
put
that
authority
in
the
mail
where
i
think
it
ought
to
be.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
going
to
have
to
say
that
i
have
not
personally
examined
those
records.
i
will
say
that
i
believe
they
will
show
that
they
were
granted
on
approval
of
at
least
two
commissioners
by
the
city
clerk
rather
than
formal
action
in
the
city
commission
meeting.
now
that
would
be
my
thought.
i
have
not
reviewed
the
records
but
that
--
i
do
think
that
that
would
be
the
results.of
course,
i
still
say
that
that
is
not
relevant
to
this
case.
that
if
--
that
they
could
have
come
to
the
jury
and
say
look
here
your
honor,
we
don't
--
or
not
to
have
to
go
to
the
city
commission
to
get
these
permits.
that's
invalid
in
law
if
it
is
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
but
it's
invalidly
--
it
has
been
invalidly
applied.
and
we
would
like
for
your
honor
to
let
us
have
the
parades.
when
our
judge
johnson
did
that,
he
said,
“you
take
this
parade
from
selma
to
montgomery.
and
there've
been
in
a
number
of
cases
in
which
--
even
in
birmingham,
the
city
has
been
enjoined
in
enforcing
certain
ordinances,
in
certain
respects,
and
under
the
old
co
--
city
code.
and
so
i
say
it
is
absolutely
immaterial
in
this
case
whether
it
was
or
was
not
of
practice
because
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
now,
what
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
say
you're
correct
if
it
was
a
prosecution
--
violating
of
an
order.
but
it
goes
through
the
how
--
by
prosecution
for
contempt,
for
violating
a
court
order.
a
court
order
commands
greater
respect
and
must
on
our
system
of
government
command
greater
respect
in
an
order.
now
in
an
ordinance,
you
can't
test
it
except
probably
by
being
arrested.
but
in
the
court
order,
the
way
as
they
are
charted
by
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
society
as
a
whole
sec
--
if
this
order
is
wrong,
come
in
and
tell
the
judge.
and
that's
what
these
cases
say
through
--
all
through
the
country,
that
you
modif
--
come
to
the
judge
and
get
it
modified
and
get
it
resolved
out.
i'll
give
you
one
illustration,
i
got
an
order
enjoining
the
--
me,
eight
or
nine
years
back
from
playing
night
baseball
in
the
certain
park.
the
case
was
applied
only
to
one
corner
of
the
park.
we
had
a
big
lighted
baseball
down
in
another
part
of
the
park.
but
we
--
i
--
we
didn't
play
baseball
in
violation
of
that
order.
i
marched
into
the
court,
filed
a
motion
for
modification,
and
of
course,
got
it
because
it
was
an
oversight.
but
would
it
have
been
the
same
thing
if
we
say
it
was
an
invalid
order.
i
would
not
--
you
just
cannot
on
our
system
of
law
disobey
court
order.
i
think
this
court
knows
that
more
than
anyone
of
--
any
of
us,
but
in
administering
municipal
affairs,
that
is
a
matter
so
important
that
i
--
i
personally
don't
think
it's
a
big
argument.
and
i
just
want
to
say
one
thing
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
let
me
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
justice
fortas
let
me
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
let
me
answer
--
and
answer
that.
i
do
not
--
a
court
order
is
not
void
into
my
opinion.
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
authority,
of
the
issues,
and
the
authority
to
issue
injunction,
it
maybe
defective,
it
may
be
irregular
but
the
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
it
said
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
if
it
void
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
oh,
well
there
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
under
united
mine
workers
court
--
if
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction,
certainly
it
can
be
obey
--
disobeyed
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes,
i
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
of
course
i
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
of
course
to
fields,
there
the
--
there's
clearly
a
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt.
one
rule
applies
to
civil.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
if
the
order
falls,
the
contempt
falls
but
on
the
--
under
criminal,
if
the
order
falls,
the
contempt
does
not
necess
--
does
not
fall.
but
now
this
order
is
not
void.
void,
as
i
see
it
is
--
what
the
alabama
courts
mean
is
for
its
criminal
contempt
lack
of
juris
--
what's
it
--
same
thing
that
means
the
united
mine
workers,
lack
of
jurisdictions,
lack
of
authority
to
issue
and
not
feel
that
jurisdiction
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
fear
for
the
criminal
contempt,
and
fear
to
nail
down
that
we
are
far
in
the
united
mine
workers,
although
it
did.
mr.
justice
stewart
said
make
a
remark
but
the
courts
after
take
up
some
collateral
issues
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
for
various
reasons.
but
then
they
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
it
made
that
--
it
did
make
that
statement
but
it
--
if
it
stop
there,
i
would
say
it
was
authority.
but
when
it
--
you
--
if
you're
going
to
say
it's
authority
for
the
position
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
then
you
have
got
to
erase
what
follows
after.
and
you
can't
do
that,
mr.
justice
fortas.
if
you
take
what's
followed
after
it,
you
see
that
it
is
an
affirmative
adoption
of
the
unite
mine
workers
rule
and
howat
versus
kansas
also.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
into
coming
on
is
the
bona
fide
of
the
so-called
full
birmingham
demonstration
from
1963
which
have
been
mentioned
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
connection
they
have
unless
they
imply
that
the
principle
was
lofty
that
it
justifies
a
violation
of
a
direct
court
injunction
or
decree.
but
i
would
assume
that
any
municipality
like
birmingham
demonstrations
of
this
nature
would
be
aimed
at
the
hope
of
convincing
the
local
government
to
change
some
law
or
some
procedure.
now
let's
see
what
these
defendants
did.
they
mounted
by
outsiders
the
defendant's
majority
were
outsider.
they
come
in
to
the
city
of
birmingham
at
a
time
when
the
people
of
the
city
of
birmingham
had
voted
to
change
its
form
of
government.
now,
who
has
the
deciding
vote
in
that
election?
the
majority
of
the
voters
who
voted
for
the
new
form
of
government
were
negros.
and
they
voted
overwhelming
for
the
new
form
of
government.
they
have
had
had
an
election.
commissioner
connor
had
run
against
mayor
boutwell,
and
mayor
boutwell
had
won
the
election.
and
they
started
these
demonstrations
in
april,
first
of
april
1963.
and
under
the
law,
the
new
form
of
government
went
into
--
they
took
office
on
april
15th.
now
who
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
election
day
was
several
months
before
that
because
they
had
to
have
a
change
in
qualifying
the
candidates.
i
think
probably
eight
--
seven
to
eight
months
along
the
(inaudible).
i
don't
have
the
exact
date.
but
they
had
changed
the
form
of
government,
candidates
had
qualified.
they've
elected
a
council
of
nine
and
they
had
elected
a
mayor.
and
they
were
take
place,
take
office
on
april
15th.
they
started
these
demonstrations
when
the
old
government
was
in
there.
i
don't
know
what
they
expected
them
to
do
or
what
they
--
would
have
been
reasonable
to
expect.
i
don't
know
what
the
purpose
was.
but
they
started
at
a
time;
it
would
seem
to
me
reasonable
to
have
waited,
to
not
have
started
it.
but
they
started
it.
now
they
had
--
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
somewhat
over
40
meetings.
we
have
never
contended
that
we
have
in
any
way
interfered
with
freedom
of
speech.
this
injunction
ordered
the
city,
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
testifies
that
he'd
been
over
20
meetings
and
there'd
been
many
more
that
mounting
this
campaign.
there
had
been
usurpation
of
the
streets
prior
to
this
that
matters
in
this
injunction.
if
you
read
the
affidavits
on
the
complaint
you
have
seen
that
there
was
possible
disorders
in
the
streets
of
birmingham
which
might
occur
and
with
the
change
in
government
and
the
possible
disorders,
and
the
fight
that
the
court
has
authority
to
issue
an
injunction
to
hold
a
status
quo
and
determine
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
are
to
modify
the
injunction
or
to
give
the
right
or
to
require
the
city
governing
body
to
let
them
parade.
they
chose
not
to
follow
that
injunction.
they
chose
to
disobey
it.
not
because
we're
vague
and
uncertain,
of
course,
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
enjoined
but
to
select
certain
things.
they
were
definite
in
that.
instead
of
these,
we
will
disobey.
we
will
march.
we
will
--
we
want
everybody
to
come
in
and
help
us
march.
that's
the
effect
of
it,
and
they
did
do
it.
and
the
injunction
citation
was
obtained.
all
they
had
to
do
under
alabama
law
was
file
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction
and
to
modify
it.
they
could
have
had
a
hearing
in
a
few
days.
and
the
time,
there
was
nothing
urgent
about
these
demonstrations
about
the
timing
because
the
timing,
it
should
have
been
waited
until
a
new
government
took
place.
now
what
happened
on
april
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
they
have
raised
the
question
of
the
--
the
other
parties
the
--
appellants
have
raised
the
question
of
the
urgency
of
the
situation
and
the
timing
of
the
demonstration.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that's
right.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
they
want
to
have
it.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
that
is
correct.
and
of
course
they
applied
--
they
didn't
apply
to
the
governing
body
for
a
permit.
they
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
gotten
it
or
not.
i
do
know
that
they
have
been
since
a
new
form
of
government
has
taken
over,
i
know
of
no
denial
of
a
permit
for
any
parade
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
this
was
the
old
government.
now,
the
new
government
came
in
--
on
april
15th
and
the
old
government
refused
to
vacate.
so
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case
we
had
two
municipal
governments
in
city
hall
and
the
evidence
indicates
that
it
had
only
one
isolated
incidence
for
it
--
incidence
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
motion
of
--
dissolution
i
believe
mr.
mcbee
mentioned
that
this
came
first
and
that
they
have
not
moved
to
set
it
down
because
this
was
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
permits
for
parades
have
all
been
--
have
been
granted
by
the
new
form
of
government
whenever
they
were
asked
for.
and
since
the
decision
of
alabama
court
of
appeals
we
have
elected
in
view
of
that
decision
not
to
prosecute
anybody
for
parading
under
these
ordinance
without
a
permit,
awaiting
on
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
determine.
now,
what
i
was
saying
about
the
situation,
the
one
instance
in
situation
that
shows
the
confusion,
not
the
confusion
but
the
situation
in
the
city
hall
and
mr.
shorz
(ph)
question
to
mr.
connor
--
when
mr.
connor
he
says,
“you
are
commissioner
mr.
connor.”
answer;
“uh-huh."
former
commissioner
--
mr.
shorz
(ph)
says,
"former
commission
of
the
city
of
birmingham?"
“yes”,
as
mr.
connor's
answer.
then
he
says,
“did
you
say
former
commissioner?
i
am
commissioner.”
so
you
can
see
that
we
had
a
time
in
birmingham
when
this
had
to
be
handled
delicately
and
properly.
now,
we
think
that
the
record
shows
that
it
was,
that
there
was
no
first
amendment
involved
in
this
case.
they
had
all
the
meetings
they
wanted
to.
they
had
all
the
hearings.
they
could
have
gotten
permits.
they
did
get
permits
after
the
new
government
came
in.
this
same
group
got
permits
to
parade
and
got
them.
now
we
submit
that
there's
no
first
amendment
freedom
in
this
case.
and
i
say
this
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
i
say
we
submit
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
case
issue
in
this
case.
they
claim
there
is
as
i
understand
them.
our
opponents
claim
there
is
a
first
amendment
by
saying
to
--
to
modify
united
mine
workers,
to
accept
first
amendment.
it
matter
so
that
in
this
--
so
they
evidently
assume
that
this
case
involved
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
has
never
given
the
people
the
right
to
usurp
the
streets.
freedom
of
speech
as
mr.
douglas,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
thomas
versus
collins,
no
one
may
be
required
to
attain
a
license
in
order
to
speak,
and
we
certainly
agree
with
it.
but
once
he
uses
the
economic
power
which
he
has
in
all
the
means,
this
was
the
(inaudible)
case.
and
these
--
and
their
jobs
to
influence
their
action,
he
is
doing
more
than
exercising
the
freedom
of
speech
protected
by
the
constitution.
now
we
said
take
that
same
argument,
same
reasoning,
and
say
that
once
they
get
in
the
streets,
and
use
the
streets
so
as
to
inconvenience
of
other
people
and
to
divert
their
use,
they're
using
more
than
pure
speech.
and
that
this
case
involves
the
use
of
the
streets.
it
has
in
it
before
this
court
for
the
first
time,
a
clear
cut
statement
of
the
theory
that
we
do
not
obey
a
law
which
we
believe
unjust
which
horrors
right
to
the
fundamental
thought
of
the
governing
of
a
society.
it
has
that
in
there,
a
statement
and
it
has
it
put
into
practice
in
refusing
to
obey
an
injunction.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that
was
a
statement
of
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
put
out
by
martin
luth
--
at
this
press
conference.
that
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that's
in
cities
--
complainants
--
wait
a
minute,
cities
of
–
exhibit
2,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
it
is
in
the
--
in
several
places
in
it
but
--
alright.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
this
is
just
at
--
now,
at
page
410
of
the
record
says
just
as
an
old
good
conscience,
we
cannot
obey
unjust
laws
neither
can
we
respect
the
unjust
use
of
the
courts.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
this
is
a
statement
put
out
by
--
this
was
a
news
release.
it
has
written
statement
by
m.
l.
king
jr.,
f.
l.
shuttlesworth,
ralph
abernathy
et
al.
for
engaging
in
peaceful
desegregation
demonstrations.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
established
practice.
i
would
deny
that
there
were
times
when
probably
a
permit
was
issued
by
the
city
clerks.
whether
they
--
if
it
were
issued,
it
was
issued
without
authority
of
law
or
ordinance
and
had
it
--
had
the
approval
of
(inaudible)
ours
has
been
referred
too,
we
would
require
that
it'd
be
by
the
governing
body
as
we
did
require
later
that
it'd
be
by
the
city
council.
and
in
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
the
new
city
code,
we
have
changed
that
and
in
adopting
a
new
city
code
in
which
we
have
completely
taken
out
a
many
ordinances
that
were
claimed
objectionable.
we
have
put
that
authority
in
the
mail
where
i
think
it
ought
to
be.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
going
to
have
to
say
that
i
have
not
personally
examined
those
records.
i
will
say
that
i
believe
they
will
show
that
they
were
granted
on
approval
of
at
least
two
commissioners
by
the
city
clerk
rather
than
formal
action
in
the
city
commission
meeting.
now
that
would
be
my
thought.
i
have
not
reviewed
the
records
but
that
--
i
do
think
that
that
would
be
the
results.of
course,
i
still
say
that
that
is
not
relevant
to
this
case.
that
if
--
that
they
could
have
come
to
the
jury
and
say
look
here
your
honor,
we
don't
--
or
not
to
have
to
go
to
the
city
commission
to
get
these
permits.
that's
invalid
in
law
if
it
is
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
but
it's
invalidly
--
it
has
been
invalidly
applied.
and
we
would
like
for
your
honor
to
let
us
have
the
parades.
when
our
judge
johnson
did
that,
he
said,
“you
take
this
parade
from
selma
to
montgomery.
and
there've
been
in
a
number
of
cases
in
which
--
even
in
birmingham,
the
city
has
been
enjoined
in
enforcing
certain
ordinances,
in
certain
respects,
and
under
the
old
co
--
city
code.
and
so
i
say
it
is
absolutely
immaterial
in
this
case
whether
it
was
or
was
not
of
practice
because
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
now,
what
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
say
you're
correct
if
it
was
a
prosecution
--
violating
of
an
order.
but
it
goes
through
the
how
--
by
prosecution
for
contempt,
for
violating
a
court
order.
a
court
order
commands
greater
respect
and
must
on
our
system
of
government
command
greater
respect
in
an
order.
now
in
an
ordinance,
you
can't
test
it
except
probably
by
being
arrested.
but
in
the
court
order,
the
way
as
they
are
charted
by
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
society
as
a
whole
sec
--
if
this
order
is
wrong,
come
in
and
tell
the
judge.
and
that's
what
these
cases
say
through
--
all
through
the
country,
that
you
modif
--
come
to
the
judge
and
get
it
modified
and
get
it
resolved
out.
i'll
give
you
one
illustration,
i
got
an
order
enjoining
the
--
me,
eight
or
nine
years
back
from
playing
night
baseball
in
the
certain
park.
the
case
was
applied
only
to
one
corner
of
the
park.
we
had
a
big
lighted
baseball
down
in
another
part
of
the
park.
but
we
--
i
--
we
didn't
play
baseball
in
violation
of
that
order.
i
marched
into
the
court,
filed
a
motion
for
modification,
and
of
course,
got
it
because
it
was
an
oversight.
but
would
it
have
been
the
same
thing
if
we
say
it
was
an
invalid
order.
i
would
not
--
you
just
cannot
on
our
system
of
law
disobey
court
order.
i
think
this
court
knows
that
more
than
anyone
of
--
any
of
us,
but
in
administering
municipal
affairs,
that
is
a
matter
so
important
that
i
--
i
personally
don't
think
it's
a
big
argument.
and
i
just
want
to
say
one
thing
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
let
me
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
justice
fortas
let
me
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
let
me
answer
--
and
answer
that.
i
do
not
--
a
court
order
is
not
void
into
my
opinion.
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
authority,
of
the
issues,
and
the
authority
to
issue
injunction,
it
maybe
defective,
it
may
be
irregular
but
the
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
it
said
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
if
it
void
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
oh,
well
there
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
under
united
mine
workers
court
--
if
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction,
certainly
it
can
be
obey
--
disobeyed
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes,
i
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
of
course
i
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
of
course
to
fields,
there
the
--
there's
clearly
a
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt.
one
rule
applies
to
civil.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
if
the
order
falls,
the
contempt
falls
but
on
the
--
under
criminal,
if
the
order
falls,
the
contempt
does
not
necess
--
does
not
fall.
but
now
this
order
is
not
void.
void,
as
i
see
it
is
--
what
the
alabama
courts
mean
is
for
its
criminal
contempt
lack
of
juris
--
what's
it
--
same
thing
that
means
the
united
mine
workers,
lack
of
jurisdictions,
lack
of
authority
to
issue
and
not
feel
that
jurisdiction
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
fear
for
the
criminal
contempt,
and
fear
to
nail
down
that
we
are
far
in
the
united
mine
workers,
although
it
did.
mr.
justice
stewart
said
make
a
remark
but
the
courts
after
take
up
some
collateral
issues
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
for
various
reasons.
but
then
they
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well
it
made
that
--
it
did
make
that
statement
but
it
--
if
it
stop
there,
i
would
say
it
was
authority.
but
when
it
--
you
--
if
you're
going
to
say
it's
authority
for
the
position
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
then
you
have
got
to
erase
what
follows
after.
and
you
can't
do
that,
mr.
justice
fortas.
if
you
take
what's
followed
after
it,
you
see
that
it
is
an
affirmative
adoption
of
the
unite
mine
workers
rule
and
howat
versus
kansas
also.
thank
you.
