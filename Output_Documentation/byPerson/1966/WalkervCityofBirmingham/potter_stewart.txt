justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
that's
what
the
ordinance
says
too,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
--
the
ordinance
does
say
that
the
license
has
to
be
secured
from
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
the
telegram
also
informed
you
that
the
license
had
to
be
secured
from
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
whatever
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
might
have
been
done
(voice
overlap)
--
you
were
told
both
by
the
words
of
the
ordinance
and
by
the
specific
language
of
the
telegram
that
the
li
--
that
your
application
for
a
license
had
to
be
made
with
the
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
the
telegram
told
you
that
--
the
entire
commission
has
to
grant
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
what
the
ordinance
says?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
commissioner
was
sending
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
wrong
about
that,
isn't
it?
right?
are
you
implying
that
that's
shocking,
that
you
had
--
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
without
a
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
question
like
what?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
claiborne,
i
followed
your
argument,
i
wanted
to
see
to
what
ultimately
it
is
directed.
the
mine
workers
rule
was
a
rule
in
the
federal
courts
basically,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
requirement.
there
--
there's
nothing
constitutional
about
it,
i
suppose.
there's
not
requirement
that
every
state
follow
the
mine
workers
rule.
has
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
indicated
really
not
follow
that.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
here,
alabama
has
followed
it
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
we
agree
on
that.
and
you're
claim
now
is
that
the
alabama,
there
--
there's
a
constitutional
compulsion
upon
alabama
not
to
follow
it
or
is
it
your
claim
that,
well,
alright
alabama
could've
followed
it
to
satisfy
themselves
but
that's
an
inadequate
state
ground,
which
is
your
argument
or
neither?
justice
potter
stewart
prohibits
the
state
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitution
prohibits
the
state
in
this
kind
--
in
this
kind
of
a
case
--
in
this
case
from
following
the
mine
workers
rule.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
your
argument
then
simply
that
this
is
an
inadequate
state
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
that
another
way
of
putting
the
same
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
not
necessarily
of
course,
often
a
state
ground
is
inadequate
even
though
it's
--
even
though
it
--
it's
maybe
partly
constitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
--
excuse
me,
is
your
argument
then
--
is
it
confined
to
the
first
amendment
or
is
--
would
this
--
would
your
argument
be
the
same
that
any
provision
of
the
constitution
deprive
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
injunction?
and
if
not,
why
not?
in
other
words,
why
or
how
can
it
--
what
should
there
be
confined
to
the
first
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well
likely,
it's
certainly
perhaps
not
in
this
case
but
when
we
just
--
when
we
think
of
an
argument,
and
we
decide
a
case,
it's
certainly
not
a
better
part
of
(inaudible)
or
its
just
think
how
far
it
does
reach,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
thinking
for
example
about
that
somebody
relying
on
the
ninth
amendment
or
the
tenth
amendment.
and
if
you're
thinking
he
can
disobey
his
choice
and
his
discretion
on
an
injunction
of
a
federal
court
because
he
reaches
a
conclusion
that
the
federal
court
is
absolutely
without
jurisdiction
to
order
and
to
do
something
because
of
the
ninth
amendment
or
the
tenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
make
exactly
the
same
argument,
couldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
certainly
not
right,
isn't
it?
is
it
--
it
could
many
times
be
very
clearly
true
in
the
area
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment?
what
if
the
federal
court
had
enjoined
the
person
from
getting
a
divorce
under
the
state
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
clearly
be
a
violation
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment
of
the
--
because
that's
clearly
a
manner
for
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
decide
any
full
faith
in
credit
competition.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
here
is
that
the
ordinance
provides
that
a
permit
on
application
maybe
issued
by
the
commission
and
there
was
never
any
application
to
the
commission
or
a
permit
in
this
case
so
you
don't
know
how
broad
or
narrow
it
was
in
practice.
it
never
applied
to
the
commission
although
they
were
told
to
by
the
language
of
the
ordinance
and
they
were
told
to
specifically
by
telegram.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
commission
has
never
withheld
a
permit
from
these
people
because
they
never
applied
to
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
let's
assume
it
is
censorship
which
is
that
fairly
large
step.
doesn't
the
issue
to
that
chicago
case
that
cut
the
other
way?
the
chicago
moving
picture
case,
i
cant
think
of
other.
justice
potter
stewart
time
still?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
this
injunction
i
supposed
that
would
have
been
the
issue
there.
one
of
the
important
issues
and
you
never
pursued
it.
i
don't
mean
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
on
the
fields
case,
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
said
we
cannot
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
did
reach
it
when
they
said
we
cannot
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
potter
stewart
if
that's
not
reaching,
then
what
is
it
doing?
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
way
of
saying
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
your
argument
--
is
your
argument
that
you're
now
making
mr.
mcbee,
this,
that
the
application
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
of
the
mine
workers
rule
in
the
present
case
was
no
change
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
thought
of
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
pictures
are
right
at
the
back
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
on
the
streets
or
other
public
way
of
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
way,
it
says.
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
say
no
or
did
they
say
we
haven't
got
the
power
to
say
yes
or
no.
you
have
to
go
to
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
three
commissions.
one
of
whom
is
the
mayor
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
three
commissioners?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
is
one
of
the
commissioners,
the
mayor?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
when?
justice
potter
stewart
when
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
that
happen,
mr.
mcbee?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
not
suggested
--
you're
suggesting
that
when
they
applied
to
mr.
connor,
they
were
a
prior
--
applying
to
a
private
(voice

justice
potter

he
was
holding
over
--
pending
the
straight
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
the
election
had
taken
place.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
then
was
when
did
the
new
people
take
over
and
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
was
holding
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
in
may?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
in
april.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
--
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
april.
we
tried
this
case
i
believe
about
the
23rd
and
24th
of
april
and
they
took
the
office
in
may
following.
and
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
there
is
any
rule
in
the
fed
--
in
the
courts
of
alabama
giving
precedence
and
priority
to
injunction
hearings.
we
do
have
a
rule,
rule
47
which
does
provide
that
they
shall
give
priority
to
hearings
of
this
particular
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
said,
considered
another
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you'd
not
enforced
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
election
date?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
rather
up
to
them.
i
mean
it
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
you
to
decide
whether
how
urgent
it
was,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
wanted
to
have
their
parades
on
easter
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
good
friday
and
easter
sunday.
justice
potter
stewart
those
days
come
only
once
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
the
old
government
still
in
office.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
was
your
opponent's
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
that's
what
the
ordinance
says
too,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
--
the
ordinance
does
say
that
the
license
has
to
be
secured

the

has

and
here,

has
followed

justice

stewart
when
did
that
happen,
mr.
mcbee?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
not
suggested
--
you're
suggesting
that
when
they
applied
to
mr.
connor,
they
were
a
prior
--
applying
to
a
private
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
he
was
holding
over
--
pending
the
straight
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
the
election
had
taken
place.
justice
potter
stewart

question
then
was

the
new
people
take
over
and
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
was
holding
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
in
may?

stewart
and

was
in
april.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
--
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
april.
we
tried
this
case
i
believe
about
the
23rd
and
24th
of
april
and
they
took
the
office
in
may
following.
and
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
there
is
any
rule
in
the
fed
--
in
the
courts
of
alabama
giving
precedence
and
priority
to
injunction
hearings.
we
do
have
a
rule,
rule
47
which
does
provide
that
they
shall
give
priority
to
hearings
of
this
particular
kind.

you
said,
considered
another
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you'd
not
enforced
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
election
date?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
rather
up
to
them.
i
mean
it
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
you
to
decide
whether
how
urgent
it
was,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
wanted
to
have
their
parades
on
easter
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
good
friday
and
easter
sunday.
justice
potter
stewart
those
days
come
only
once
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
the
old
government
still
in
office.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
was
your
opponent's
claim?
