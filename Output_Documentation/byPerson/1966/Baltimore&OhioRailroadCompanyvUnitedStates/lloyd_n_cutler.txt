mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
allotted
ten
minutes
to
present
to
you
the
unique
position
of
the
central
railroad
of
new
jersey,
one
of
the
appellant
railroads,
the
number
642.
c
&
j
is
a
relatively
small
railroad
but
it
is
an
important
one
and
there
are
those
who
depend
upon
it
even
though
they
might
not
love
it.
it
carries
18%
of
all
the
railway
freight
tonnage
originating
or
terminating
in
the
port
of
new
york
area.
and
it's
second
only
in
this
respect
only
to
the
pennsylvania
and
its
affiliates.
c
&
j
believes
that
it
will
be
unable
to
survive
the
impact
of
penn-central.
in
this
respect,
its
position
is
identical
to
that
of
e-l,
d
&
h
and
b
&
m,
i'm
really
sorry
for
all
of
these
initials,
which
have
been
referred
to
as
the
three
protected
roads.
but
unlike
the
three
protected
roads,
c
&
j
has
been
unable
to
obtain
a
hearing
before
the
commission
as
to
how
seriously
it
will
be
injured
by
a
merge
to
penn-central.
as
a
result,
the
commission
has
made
no
finding
as
to
the
ability
of
c
&
j
to
survive
penn-central
and
it
has
made
no
provision
looking
toward
the
inclusion
of
c
&
j
in
any
other
major
system
or
for
protecting
it
in
some
way
during
the
interim.
and
c
&
j
has
been
asking
so
far
without
success
that
only
that
it
be
given
such
a
hearing
before
penn-central
is
allowed
to
consummate.
under
this
court's
opinion
in
mclean
trucking
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
commission's
duty
before
approving
a
merger
as
large
as
penn-central
to
consider
its
effect
on
other
competing
eastern
railroads
and
in
fact
the
commission
expressly
recognizes
this
obligation
in
its
original
report
in
order.
nor
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
consider
the
effect
of
penn-central
on
c
&
j.
indeed
the
commission
in
its
report
on
reconsideration
made
an
expressed
finding
that
there
had
been
no
showing
of
record
on
this
point
one
way
or
the
other.
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
years,
c
&
j
has
been
trying
to
present
evidence
to
the
commission
showing
that
continuation
to
--
of
its
service
is
essential.
that
it
will
probably
be
unable
to
survive
penn-central
and
that
it
should
be
protected
from
the
impact
of
penn-central,
pending
its
inclusion
in
some
other
railroad
in
the
same
way
that
the
commission
intends
to
protect
the
three
protected
roads.
but
the
commission
has
turned
all
of
these
efforts
aside
either
on
the
ground
that
they
are
too
late
because
it
has
found
c
&
j
guilty
of
latches
or
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
too
early
and
that
c
&
j
will
be
given
an
opportunity
in
some
other
proceeding
at
some
other
time
after
penn-central
has
been
consummated
to
obtain
the
protection
it
needs.
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
period
of
latches
does
not
stand
up.
first,
it
doesn't
fit
the
facts
of
this
case.
it's
true
that
c
&
j
did
not
take
part
in
the
first
round
of
hearings
which
terminated
on
october
2nd
of
1963.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
sir.
the
n
&
w,
c
&
o,
b
&
o
merger
plan
contemplates
the
inclusion
of
c
&
j
and
c
&
j
has
petitioned
for
an
inclusion.
and
that's
the
only
proposal
to
date
that
would
take
care
of
c
&
j.
after
the
original
--
during
the
original
hearings
penn
and
central
were
vigorously
opposing
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
the
point
that
was
going
to
cause
the
most
injury
to
c
&
j
because
the
new
haven
is
one
of
c
&
j's
major
interchange
partners.
but
in
june
of
1964
after
the
hearings
--
at
the
first
days
of
the
hearing
had
closed,
penn
and
central
soften
there
opposition
to
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
and
indicated
that
they
would
be
willing
to
work
out
some
arrangement
with
the
new
haven.
and
at
this
point
which
was
two
and
one
half
years
ago,
c
&
j
petitioned
to
intervene
and
to
offer
evidence
showing
how
badly
it
would
be
damaged.
the
commission
allowed
the
petition
for
intervention
but
it
did
not
allow
c
&
j
to
introduce
it
evidence
saying
that
it
had
stood
by
during
the
first
round
of
hearings
and
that
it
was
too
late.
at
the
very
same
time
the
commission
in
it
same
order
did
reopened
these
hearings
for
september
of
1964
to
hear
some
evidence
on
the
labor
conditions.
and
as
it
turned
out,
hearing
c
&
j
at
that
time
would
not
have
done
any
harm
at
all
or
delay
in
the
process
because
the
examiners
did
not
file
their
report
until
march
of
1965,
some
eight
months
later.
so
that
the
commission
was
simply
wrong
when
in
its
decision
on
reconsideration,
it
lumped
c
&
j
with
n
&
w,
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
instead
of
all
four
that
their
expressions
of
discontent
now
more
than
four
years
after
the
merger
application
was
filed
come
to
late
for
theory
of
consideration
herein.
for
more
than
two
of
those
four
years,
the
c
&
j
was
doing
it's
very
best
to
be
heard
and
the
commission
would
not
hear
it.
the
theory
of
latches
is
even
weaker
as
applied
to
the
other
penn-central
terms
that
are
merged
even
later
and
also
injures
c
&
j.
for
example,
the
indemnity
arrangements
that
are
provided
for
the
three
protected
roads
did
not
come
to
light
until
they
first
appeared
in
the
commission's
original
report
and
order
of
april
1966.
c
&
j
promptly
requested
reconsideration
and
asked
for
such
protective
indemnity
terms
for
itself.
but
the
commission
again
refused
on
the
same
theory
of
latches
and
even
applied
that
theory
of
latches
to
the
notion
of
a
capital
indemnity
which
had
been
introduced
as
an
idea
for
the
very
first
time
in
the
petitions
of
reconsideration
of
the
other
railroads.
in
any
event,
we
would
submit
that
the
theory
of
latches
does
not
fit
the
framework
of
an
administrative
agency
that
is
suppose
to
find
where
the
public
interest
lies.
to
illustrate
the
point,
we
need
only
look
at
what
the
commission
did
for
the
three
protected
roads.
it
found
that
they
provided
essential
services.
that
they
could
not
survive
penn-central
and
that
as
the
commission
said,
“unless
they
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
their
future
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
at
this
time”.
now
let's
assume
that
one
of
those
three
protected
roads
had
also
been
late
in
presenting
its
evidence.
could
the
commission
as
the
guardian
of
the
public
interest
say
that,
“even
though
this
evidence
had
they
heard
it
would
have
convinced
them
of
the
above
conclusions
that
they
would
nevertheless
deprive
the
public
of
this
essential
service
because
the
applicant
had
been
too
late”.
we
think
the
answer
is
obviously
not.
and
yet
that's
precisely
the
way
the
commission
has
treated
c
&
j.
mr.
--
so
much
for
the
argument
that
c
&
j
is
too
late.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
our
position
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
merger
should
be
held
up
until
a
hearing
is
given
into
c
--
to
c
&
j.
and
if
the
commission
determines
that
c
&
j
service
is
essential
and
that
it
will
be
damaged
seriously
and
may
not
be
able
to
survive
penn-central.
that
some
protective
condition
should
be
devised
for
us
until
we
can
be
included
in
a
major
system
in
the
same
way
as
the
three
protected
roads.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
they
made
no
findings
and
its
literally
true
mr.
justice
white.
they
paid
no
attention
whatever
other
than
the
saying
you're
late
and
don't
bother.
they
also
said
we
were
too
early
and
that
we
could
be
heard
at
some
later
face
for
example
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
proceedings
in
order
to
protect
our
interchange
relationships
with
the
new
haven.
but
as
we've
shown
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
conditions
devised
at
a
later
time
may
never
work
out
and
provide
the
kind
of
protection
that
we
need.
moreover,
they
may
come
far
too
late
to
do
us
any
possible
good.
in
the
brief
moment
that
i
have
left
i'd
like
to
read
to
you
from
one
authority
on
page
14
of
our
reply
brief
which
is
through
the
looking
glass
from
the
speakers,
the
white
queen.
and
she
said,
”the
rule
is
jam
tomorrow
and
jam
yesterday
but
never
jam
today.
it
must
come
sometime
to
jam
today”,
alice
objected.
“no,
it
can't,”
said
the
queen.
“it's
jam
every
other
day.
today
isn't
any
other
day,
you
know”.
now
all
that
c
&
j
asks
is
a
small
taste
of
jam
today.
the
hearing
on
the
injury
of
the
penn-central
will
inflict
and
a
decision
about
its
future
while
it's
still
alive.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
may
i
direct
to
the
record
on
that
moment
mr.
chief
justice.
our
objection
was
that
we
were
not
provided
protective
conditions
of
our
own
or
capital
indemnity
conditions
within
the
office.
our
evidence
on
that
subject
in
this
free
open
hearing
was
denied,
was
refuse
entry
and
that
decision
upheld
by
commission.
we
were
permitted
to
offer
evidence
that
protected
conditions
offered
to
other
railroads
might
cause
conditional
injuries
to
us
and
that
matters
are
still
pending
to
the
commission.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
allotted
ten
minutes
to
present
to
you
the
unique
position
of
the
central
railroad
of
new
jersey,
one
of
the
appellant
railroads,
the
number
642.
c
&
j
is
a
relatively
small
railroad
but
it
is
an
important
one
and
there
are
those
who
depend
upon
it
even
though
they
might
not
love
it.
it
carries
18%
of
all
the
railway
freight
tonnage
originating
or
terminating
in
the
port
of
new
york
area.
and
it's
second
only
in
this
respect
only
to
the
pennsylvania
and
its
affiliates.
c
&
j
believes
that
it
will
be
unable
to
survive
the
impact
of
penn-central.
in
this
respect,
its
position
is
identical
to
that
of
e-l,
d
&
h
and
b
&
m,
i'm
really
sorry
for
all
of
these
initials,
which
have
been
referred
to
as
the
three
protected
roads.
but
unlike
the
three
protected
roads,
c
&
j
has
been
unable
to
obtain
a
hearing
before
the
commission
as
to
how
seriously
it
will
be
injured
by
a
merge
to
penn-central.
as
a
result,
the
commission
has
made
no
finding
as
to
the
ability
of
c
&
j
to
survive
penn-central
and
it
has
made
no
provision
looking
toward
the
inclusion
of
c
&
j
in
any
other
major
system
or
for
protecting
it
in
some
way
during
the
interim.
and
c
&
j
has
been
asking
so
far
without
success
that
only
that
it
be
given
such
a
hearing
before
penn-central
is
allowed
to
consummate.
under
this
court's
opinion
in
mclean
trucking
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
commission's
duty
before
approving
a
merger
as
large
as
penn-central
to
consider
its
effect
on
other
competing
eastern
railroads
and
in
fact
the
commission
expressly
recognizes
this
obligation
in
its
original
report
in
order.
nor
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
consider
the
effect
of
penn-central
on
c
&
j.
indeed
the
commission
in
its
report
on
reconsideration
made
an
expressed
finding
that
there
had
been
no
showing
of
record
on
this
point
one
way
or
the
other.
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
years,
c
&
j
has
been
trying
to
present
evidence
to
the
commission
showing
that
continuation
to
--
of
its
service
is
essential.
that
it
will
probably
be
unable
to
survive
penn-central
and
that
it
should
be
protected
from
the
impact
of
penn-central,
pending
its
inclusion
in
some
other
railroad
in
the
same
way
that
the
commission
intends
to
protect
the
three
protected
roads.
but
the
commission
has
turned
all
of
these
efforts
aside
either
on
the
ground
that
they
are
too
late
because
it
has
found
c
&
j
guilty
of
latches
or
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
too
early
and
that
c
&
j
will
be
given
an
opportunity
in
some
other
proceeding
at
some
other
time
after
penn-central
has
been
consummated
to
obtain
the
protection
it
needs.
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
period
of
latches
does
not
stand
up.
first,
it
doesn't
fit
the
facts
of
this
case.
it's
true
that
c
&
j
did
not
take
part
in
the
first
round
of
hearings
which
terminated
on
october
2nd
of
1963.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
sir.
the
n
&
w,
c
&
o,
b
&
o
merger
plan
contemplates
the
inclusion
of
c
&
j
and
c
&
j
has
petitioned
for
an
inclusion.
and
that's
the
only
proposal
to
date
that
would
take
care
of
c
&
j.
after
the
original
--
during
the
original
hearings
penn
and
central
were
vigorously
opposing
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
the
point
that
was
going
to
cause
the
most
injury
to
c
&
j
because
the
new
haven
is
one
of
c
&
j's
major
interchange
partners.
but
in
june
of
1964
after
the
hearings
--
at
the
first
days
of
the
hearing
had
closed,
penn
and
central
soften
there
opposition
to
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
and
indicated
that
they
would
be
willing
to
work
out
some
arrangement
with
the
new
haven.
and
at
this
point
which
was
two
and
one
half
years
ago,
c
&
j
petitioned
to
intervene
and
to
offer
evidence
showing
how
badly
it
would
be
damaged.
the
commission
allowed
the
petition
for
intervention
but
it
did
not
allow
c
&
j
to
introduce
it
evidence
saying
that
it
had
stood
by
during
the
first
round
of
hearings
and
that
it
was
too
late.
at
the
very
same
time
the
commission
in
it
same
order
did
reopened
these
hearings
for
september
of
1964
to
hear
some
evidence
on
the
labor
conditions.
and
as
it
turned
out,
hearing
c
&
j
at
that
time
would
not
have
done
any
harm
at
all
or
delay
in
the
process
because
the
examiners
did
not
file
their
report
until
march
of
1965,
some
eight
months
later.
so
that
the
commission
was
simply
wrong
when
in
its
decision
on
reconsideration,
it
lumped
c
&
j
with
n
&
w,
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
instead
of
all
four
that
their
expressions
of
discontent
now
more
than
four
years
after
the
merger
application
was
filed
come
to
late
for
theory
of
consideration
herein.
for
more
than
two
of
those
four
years,
the
c
&
j
was
doing
it's
very
best
to
be
heard
and
the
commission
would
not
hear
it.
the
theory
of
latches
is
even
weaker
as
applied
to
the
other
penn-central
terms
that
are
merged
even
later
and
also
injures
c
&
j.
for
example,
the
indemnity
arrangements
that
are
provided
for
the
three
protected
roads
did
not
come
to
light
until
they
first
appeared
in
the
commission's
original
report
and
order
of
april
1966.
c
&
j
promptly
requested
reconsideration
and
asked
for
such
protective
indemnity
terms
for
itself.
but
the
commission
again
refused
on
the
same
theory
of
latches
and
even
applied
that
theory
of
latches
to
the
notion
of
a
capital
indemnity
which
had
been
introduced
as
an
idea
for
the
very
first
time
in
the
petitions
of
reconsideration
of
the
other
railroads.
in
any
event,
we
would
submit
that
the
theory
of
latches
does
not
fit
the
framework
of
an
administrative
agency
that
is
suppose
to
find
where
the
public
interest
lies.
to
illustrate
the
point,
we
need
only
look
at
what
the
commission
did
for
the
three
protected
roads.
it
found
that
they
provided
essential
services.
that
they
could
not
survive
penn-central
and
that
as
the
commission
said,
“unless
they
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
their
future
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
at
this
time”.
now
let's
assume
that
one
of
those
three
protected
roads
had
also
been
late
in
presenting
its
evidence.
could
the
commission
as
the
guardian
of
the
public
interest
say
that,
“even
though
this
evidence
had
they
heard
it
would
have
convinced
them
of
the
above
conclusions
that
they
would
nevertheless
deprive
the
public
of
this
essential
service
because
the
applicant
had
been
too
late”.
we
think
the
answer
is
obviously
not.
and
yet
that's
precisely
the
way
the
commission
has
treated
c
&
j.
mr.
--
so
much
for
the
argument
that
c
&
j
is
too
late.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
our
position
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
merger
should
be
held
up
until
a
hearing
is
given
into
c
--
to
c
&
j.
and
if
the
commission
determines
that
c
&
j
service
is
essential
and
that
it
will
be
damaged
seriously
and
may
not
be
able
to
survive
penn-central.
that
some
protective
condition
should
be
devised
for
us
until
we
can
be
included
in
a
major
system
in
the
same
way
as
the
three
protected
roads.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
they
made
no
findings
and
its
literally
true
mr.
justice
white.
they
paid
no
attention
whatever
other
than
the
saying
you're
late
and
don't
bother.
they
also
said
we
were
too
early
and
that
we
could
be
heard
at
some
later
face
for
example
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
proceedings
in
order
to
protect
our
interchange
relationships
with
the
new
haven.
but
as
we've
shown
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
conditions
devised
at
a
later
time
may
never
work
out
and
provide
the
kind
of
protection
that
we
need.
moreover,
they
may
come
far
too
late
to
do
us
any
possible
good.
in
the
brief
moment
that
i
have
left
i'd
like
to
read
to
you
from
one
authority
on
page
14
of
our
reply
brief
which
is
through
the
looking
glass
from
the
speakers,
the
white
queen.
and
she
said,
”the
rule
is
jam
tomorrow
and
jam
yesterday
but
never
jam
today.
it
must
come
sometime
to
jam
today”,
alice
objected.
“no,
it
can't,”
said
the
queen.
“it's
jam
every
other
day.
today
isn't
any
other
day,
you
know”.
now
all
that
c
&
j
asks
is
a
small
taste
of
jam
today.
the
hearing
on
the
injury
of
the
penn-central
will
inflict
and
a
decision
about
its
future
while
it's
still
alive.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
may
i
direct
to
the
record
on
that
moment
mr.
chief
justice.
our
objection
was
that
we
were
not
provided
protective
conditions
of
our
own
or
capital
indemnity
conditions
within
the
office.
our
evidence
on
that
subject
in
this
free
open
hearing
was
denied,
was
refuse
entry
and
that
decision
upheld
by
commission.
we
were
permitted
to
offer
evidence
that
protected
conditions
offered
to
other
railroads
might
cause
conditional
injuries
to
us
and
that
matters
are
still
pending
to
the
commission.
