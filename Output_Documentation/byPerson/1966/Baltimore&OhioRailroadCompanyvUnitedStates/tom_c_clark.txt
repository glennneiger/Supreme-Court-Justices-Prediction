say,
your
position
and
i
take
it
as
if

and
that
if
c
&
o
permitted
to
go
through,
you
would
not
approve
of
the

justice

you'd
include
b

would
you?
justice

and
you
haven't

what
was
this

the
(inaudible),
21
by

that
allows
you

that
allows
what?
that
allows
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
n
&
w
to
take
in
these
reasons.
justice
tom
c.
clark
let's
see
if
i
understand
this
mr.
solicitor.
is
it
your
argument
that
this
ought
not
to
go
through
until
there's
a
home
found
for
these
orphans?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
alternatively
if
no
home
adequate
protective
condition.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
--
the
conditions
are
in
entered
many
way,
aren't
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
only
--
they're
only
suppose
to
be
interim
until
it
is
decided
into
which
system
these
three
roads
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
your
position
is
that
the
--
as
this
court
should
not
make
a
final
decision
until
the
commission
itself
decide
into
which
system
these
three
should
go
ultimately.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
why
do
you
say
18
months?
that
might
be
18
years?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
but
you
did
say
18
months
or?
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
ever
longer
time
that
needs
to
or
that
needs
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
there
maybe
judicial
review
involve,
couldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it
has
to,
i
admit
doesn't
have
to?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
--
and
in
the
mean
time
i
gather,
you
want
us
to
hang
on
to
the
case
and
come
back
to
it
maybe
two,
three
whatever
number
of
years
to
the
fact?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
about
the
new
haven?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
know
but
do
we
know
where
the
new
haven's
going
to
find
a
home?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
we
have
to
wait
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
should
we
wait
till
we
find
out
that
facts?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
it
may
not
be
an
orphan
but
its
strikes
me
that
it's
got
a
lot
of
the
attributes?
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
the
--
is
there
an
attempt
to
rest
on
whether
they
approve
the
d
&
o
and
c
&
o
merger
proposal?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
within
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
penn-central?
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
you
don't
reach
the
other
one?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
where
there
the
court
went
through,
would
that
be
satisfactory?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
isn't
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
just
one
last
moment.
justice
tom
c.
clark
now,
did
i
understand
you
amended
with
--
you
answered
me
earlier
not
with
the
new
haven
is
on
time
that
the
--
you
--
the
government
is
also
suggesting
that
the
commissioner
wrap
up
the
norfolk
and
western
and
c
&
o,
b
&
o
merger
matter
before
we
do
anything
further.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
what
then?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
wouldn't
we
send
it
back
the
three-judge
court?
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
commission
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
that's
inclusion
case.
justice
tom
c.
clark
now,
is
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
can't
--
back
over
into
the
second
circuit?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
can't
go
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
happened
to
suddenly?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
suppose
it
could
go
into
the
same
court,
couldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
if
everybody
was
still
happy
then
we
can
send
it
back
then.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
we
have
to
