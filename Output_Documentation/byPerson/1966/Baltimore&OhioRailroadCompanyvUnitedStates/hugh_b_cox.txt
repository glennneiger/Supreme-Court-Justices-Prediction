mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
new
york
central
in
this
case.
there
are
two
problems
here.
one
is
the
problem
whether
the
commission's
finding
that
this
merger
is
in
the
public
interest
is
valid
and
should
be
sustained.
that
is
the
point
to
which
the
arguments
in
the
city
of
scranton,
and
mr.
shapp
directed
yesterday.
the
other
question
is
whether
assuming
that
the
finding
of
the
mergers
in
public
interest
is
valid,
the
merger
should
be
consummated
now
or
at
some
differed
time,
it
was
at
that
point
the
arguments
of
the
carrier
appellants
were
directed
yesterday.
i
should
like
to
begin
by
saying
a
little
about
the
arguments
that
were
made
against
the
merits
of
the
commissions'
decision
as
to
the
public
interest
element
of
this
merger.
in
our
brief,
we
have
questioned
the
standing
of
mr.
shapp
and
the
city
of
scranton
to
raise
these
points.
i
should
like
to
rely
upon
that
discussion
in
the
brief
and
to
leave
that
point
in
that
posture.
in
our
brief,
we
have
also
discussed
the
merits
of
those
attacks
upon
the
findings
of
the
commission.
and
again
in
large
part,
i
should
prefer
to
rely
upon
that
discussion
in
the
brief
as
to
the
merits
of
the
attack.
but
there
are
one
or
two
comments
that
i
should
like
to
make
about
the
arguments
that
were
made
yesterday
about
the
commission's
findings.
and
i
shall
begin
by
commenting
on
mr.
keyserling's
arguments
or
at
least
the
main
branch
of
his
argument
which
involved
it
seem
to
me
two
related
ideas,
closely
related.
one
was
that
the
commission
had
not
given
proper
consideration
or
attached
enough
weight
to
the
improved
financial
position
of
these
two
carriers
in
1964
and
1965
and
that
the
other
was
that
the
commissions'
order
was
invalid
because
in
the
event,
it
turned
out
that
projections
that
mr.
keyserling
made
about
traffic
volumes
in
1964
and
1965
were
a
great
deal
better
as
indeed
they
were
than
in
traffic
projections
that
were
offered
in
the
evidence
by
the
two
railroads.
now,
these
arguments
are
related
because
i
understand
mr.
keyserling's
position
on
economics
it
is
the
1964
and
1965
refers
on
a
chart
that
should
gone
up
and
mr.
keyserling
believes,
of
course
he
is
an
eminent
columnist.
he
is
good
--
entitled
consideration.
these
curves
are
going
to
keep
on
going
up
and
up
and
the
railroads
here
involved
are
going
to
enjoy
prosperity
that
will
follow
from
the
rise
of
these
curves.
now
the
fact
is
that
the
commission
considered
that
arguments
so
that
it
can't
be
said
that
the
commission
ignored
it.
it
had
before
it
the
figures
as
to
1964
and
1965.
it
made
two
points
about
this
argument.
in
the
first
place
it
said
that
looking
at
the
historical
record,
it
was
not
prepared
to
accept
the
idea
that
the
curves
were
going
--
to
keep
going
up
and
up
and
up
without
any
deviation.
but
it
said
apart
from
that
that
even
if
it
accepted,
even
if
it
accept
the
projections
that
mr.
keyserling
had
made,
that
did
not
change
its
views
about
it's
basic
findings
because
on
the
record
that
the
satisfied
--
that
the
historical
record
again
that
the
railroads
was
not
necessarily,
at
least
two
railroads
particularly
share
proportionately
and
even
in
a
great
degree
these
increases
in
a
national
prosperity.
now,
this
is
all
in
the
finding
and
the
commission
supported
that
--
these
detailed
findings
pointing
out
even
in
these
two
years
which
were
years
of
unprecedented
at
least
in
recent
years
of
income
for
these
two
railroads
their
rates
of
return.
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
were
slightly
less
or
not
more
than
2%
or
too
low
by
any
--
even
by
conservative
standards
and
indeed
were
lower
than
the
return
you
could
get
on
government
bonds.
it
reviewed
and
made
findings
about
others
financial
facts
relating
to
the
conditions
of
these
railroads
in
the
pre-historical
period
of
time
covered
by
the
findings,
pointing
out
for
over
a
period
of
time
their
rates
of
return,
this
is
a
finding
made
by
the
examiners,
confirmed
by
the
commission,
their
rates
of
return
were
less
than
2%,
about
1.77%
over
a
period
of
12
years.
there
was
a
period
of
five
years
immediately
preceding
the
decision
when
these
two
railroads
did
not
have
enough
net
income,
net
income
from
their
own
railway
operations
to
pay
their
fix
charges.
in
those
years,
they
have
not
had
income
from
activities
that
were
not
related
to
their
own
railroad
operations,
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
pay
those
fix
charges.
now,
i
submit
on
that
basis
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
commission
ignored
mr.
keyserling's
arguments
and
that
they
ignored
the
facts
on
which
he
bases
those
arguments.
he
is
entitled
to
be
verified
by
his
success
of
profit
on
the
traffic
volume
but
i
submit
that
under
the
normal
standards
of
traffic
--
of
judicial
review
the
question
here
is
not
whether
mr.
keyserling
is
wiser
than
the
interstate
commerce
commissioners
in
terms
of
economic
theory
but
whether
the
commission
made
adequate
finding
based
on
substantial
evidence
which
it
did
in
this
case.
now,
i
only
want
to
try
and
comment
briefly
on
one
other
point
that
was
made
in
this
connection
which
has
to
do
with
the
argument
made
by
mr.
macdougall
for
mr.
shapp
and
again,
i'm
going
to
rely
largely
on
what
was
said
in
the
brief.
that
argument
suggests
that
the
commission
and
the
examiners
made
an
error
of
law
because
they
didn't
understand
the
public
interest
standard
laid
down
in
section
5(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if
the
members
of
the
court
will
look
at
the
examiners'
report
and
the
commission's
report,
it
will
appear
that
what
the
examiners
and
the
commission
did
was
to
comply
strictly
with
the
definitions
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
louden
case
and
in
the
new
york
securities
company
case
and
in
cases
which
have
been
decided
since
the
transportation
act
of
1940
was
decided.
the
other
statutes
such
as
the
appalachian
region
relief
act
(ph)
that
mr.
macdougall
talked
about
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
section
5(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
what
mr.
macdougall's
complaint
really
is,
i
think
that
he
again
believes
that
the
commission
didn't
give
proper
attention
to
the
effects
of
this
merger
on
the
certain
communities
in
pennsylvania.
i
respectfully
invite
the
court
again
to
look
what
the
examiners
did,
what
the
commission
did
in
terms
of
findings
about
pennsylvania.
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
is
not
here.
it's
now
supporting
the
merger
in
that
sense.
those
findings
are
detailed
and
they
show
that
commission
the
most
cheerful
consideration
on
the
facts
to
what
the
merger
effect
would
have
on
the
transportation
services
and
facilities
available
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
found
on
the
basis
of
those
detailed
findings
with
evidence
to
support
them
that
would
benefit
pennsylvania
and
not
--
now
with
that,
i
should
like
to
leave
the
questions
of
merits
and
move
to
the
matter
that
was
chiefly
subject
to
discussion
yesterday
which
is
when
should
this
merger
be
consummated.
the
commission
has
twice
found
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
for
the
merger
to
be
consummated
halfway.
it
made
that
finding
first
in
its
initial
report
in
connection
with
its
discussion
of
the
protective
conditions
that
it
was
prescribing
for
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
boston
and
maine.
it
made
it
again
more
detailed
in
its
report
on
reconsiderations.
mr.
ginnane
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
bet
that
i
could
not
accept
that
characterization
of
what
it
found.
i
read
its
report
and
i'm
referring
now
to
the
pages
i
think
there
in
327
i.c.c.
531
and
532.
i
read
those
pages
containing
findings
of
this
kind.
the
commission
said,
it
will
not
be
in
the
public
interest
to
consummate
this
merger
unless
there
are
protective
conditions
that
will
preserve
the
status
quo
and
prevent
these
three
railroads
from
having
their
service
impaired
by
the
diversion
of
traffic
to
diverge
10%
that
is
basic
finding.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there's
no
dispute
about
that
and
the
commission
has
never
withdrawn
from
or
modified
or
retracted
in
anyway
that
finding.
and
the
commission
went
ahead
and
said
to
this
end
as
i
construe
their
opinion,
to
this
end,
we
say
that
it
may
be
consummated
now
subject
to
the
conditions
that
we
specifically
set
out
in
appendix
g.
now,
the
only
thing
that's
been
reopened
in
this
proceeding
is
a
question
of
what,
if
anything
should
be
done
with
respect
to
the
specific
conditions
that
the
commission
prescribed.
the
commission
did
not
tamper
with
its
basic
finding
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
reopen
the
proceeding
largely
because
the
protected
lines
came
in
and
said
we
want
more,
we
want
better
protection
and
the
commission
said,
alright,
we'll
have
a
look
at
that.
but
that's
--
that
is
my
instruction
to
that
--
of
what
the
commission
did.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
said
also
yes
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
going
to
hurt
us.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
commission
would
have
done
with
that
in
the
absence
of
the
other
but
that
was
in
the
picture
and
the
hearings
that
cover
that
point
too
as
well
as
some
other
lines.
cnnj
is
in
that
position.
they're
having
a
hearing
on
that
point.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
perhaps
i
should
say
a
word
if
i
may
about
the
cnnj.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
central
of
new
jersey.
[laughter]
as
it
is
been
said
here,
the
--
that
railroad,
the
central
of
new
jersey,
did
not
try
to
intervene
in
this
proceeding
and
it
did
not
present
any
evidence
to
the
examiners
during
the
original
hearing,
just
stayed
out.
there
was
however,
and
what
i'm
saying
now
is
all
in
this
brief
to
look
in
the
appendix,
there
was
some
evidence
however
before
the
examiners
about
the
attitude
of
the
central
of
new
jersey
towards
the
merger
because
the
state
of
pennsylvania
which
was
collecting
evidence
at
that
point
to
oppose
the
merger
wrote
to
the
central
of
new
jersey
a
letter
and
said,
“what
about
it?
is
this
going
to
hurt
you?”
and
mr.
shoemaker
who
was
then
is
now
the
president
of
central
of
new
jersey
wrote
a
letter
back
and
said,
“no.
we
have
no
grounds
for
opposing
this
merger.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
going
to
improve
our
interchange
position
because
it
strengthens
the
position
of
the
merged
carrier.”
now
that's
what
the
commission
had
before
it
as
far
as
the
central
of
new
jersey
was
concerned
at
that
point.
now,
after
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
at
that
point,
the
new
haven
was
a
subject
of
argument
in
the
hearings.
after
it
became
and
seemed
to
be
likely
that's
a
new
haven
and
this
was
really
after
the
hearings
had
been
closed
except
on
the
matter
of
labor
conditions,
after
the
hearing
had
been
closed
to
that
extent
with
the
labor
condition
still
open,
one
of
the
periods
of
new
haven
might
be
included.
the
central
of
new
jersey
came
along
and
said
we
would
like
to
intervene
and
said
we'd
like
to
intervene
solely
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
in
this
merger
will
injure
us,
that's
the
only
point.
they
didn't
talk
about
the
things
that
mr.
cutler
has
been
talking
about
today.
and
the
examiners
or
the
commission
said,
“alright,
you
can
intervene
but
we
don't
--
we're
not
going
to
reopen
this
proceeding
at
this
point
to
take
evidence
about
what
new
haven
will
do
to
you
because
that
whole
matter
is
going
to
be
handled
in
a
hearing
about
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven.”
now
their
hearing
about
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
starts
next
monday
and
that
central
of
new
jersey
as
prior
to
that
hearing
and
one
of
the
issues
is
what
kind
of
protection
shall
be
given
to
the
central
of
new
jersey,
prevent
traffic
diversion
as
a
result
of
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven.
now
the
central
of
new
jersey
after
that
did
nothing
until
the
examiners
had
made
--
they're
prepared
with
proposed
report
and
then
it
came
along
and
filed
exceptions.
now,
i
must
say
that
in
those
exceptions,
it
indicated
that
it
was
rather
unhappy
about
the
merger,
but
it
was
rather
vague
about
it
--
not
anyone
is
interested.
i
would
like
the
court
to
look
at
this
document
because
it
made
some
complaints
about
it
but
it
didn't
propose
any
specific
conditions
for
its
protection.
it
didn't
ask
to
be
included
in
anything.
it
complains
--
so
far
as
it
complains
only
about
two
specific
things.
one
was
the
new
haven
inclusion
and
the
other
was
a
proposal
that
the
examiners
had
made
that
the
pennsylvania
should
be
required
to
give
the
d&h
some
traffic
rights
in
connection
with
this
merger.
and
the
commission
dealt
with
those
things
in
its
initial
report
and
said,
“alright,
you
get
a
hearing
on
whether
there
is
going
to
be
any
diversion
of
traffic
from
--
by
the
new
haven
in
the
new
haven
proceeding
and
that
this
trackage
right
thing
has
to
be
done
by
a
contract
which
we
have
to
approve
and
you
will
get
a
hearing
and
the
hearing
on
that
contract
on
what
should
be
done
in
connection
with
the
trackage
rights
to
prevent
diversion
of
your
traffic.
so
i
submit
that
up
to
last
july-august
when
the
central
of
new
jersey
filed
its
petition
for
reconsideration
here,
the
commission
has
afforded
the
hearing
on
the
only
complaint
of
this
railroad
that
was
specifically
made.
now,
this
thing
that
i
devoted
too
much
time
to
but
i
want
to
say
one
thing
more
because
--
and
then
i
should
finish.
mr.
cutler's
portrait
of
the
central
of
new
jersey
is
wasted
to
his
wondering
on
administrative
wasteland
where
no
man
comes
is
a
little
less
heartrending
i
think
to
read
his
brief
carefully
because
it's
apparent
that
what
the
central
of
new
jersey
is
really
saying
is
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
will
solve
our
problem,
is
to
approve
the
b&o
and
n&w
and
the
c&o
merger.
it's
true
we
have
these
prosperous
relatives,
the
b&o
and
c&o
and
the
--
but
do
they
not
--
going
to
give
us
any
money
unless
the
commission
approves
this
larger
plan.
so
this
argument,
i
think
it's
apparent
in
what
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
argument
is.
now,
i
should
like
to
move
on
to
the
question
which
i
think
is
the
important
question
here
and
it
affects
the
railroads
to
the
protected
railroads
who
really
may
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
this
and
i
think
the
arguments
entitled
serious
consideration
and
that
is
the
question
whether
this
merger
should
be
differed
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
on
the
protective
condition.
because
i
think
if
that
is
essentially
the
position
of
the
erie
and
the
d&h,
and
in
view
of
the
commission's
finding
about
what
will
be
done
to
them
by
the
merger
and
the
importance
of
their
service
is,
their
arguments
are
entitled
to
serious
consideration
and
this
is
a
serious
problem.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
merger
should
not
be
differed
pending
that
determination.
i
think
that
there
seems
to
me
to
underline
the
arguments
of
the
d&h
and
erie
in
assumption
that
if
it
is
not
deferred,
they
are
not
going
to
get
this
full
protection
from
the
commission
in
form
of
these
conditions
as
they
would
if
the
merger
is
deferred.
that
is
more
of
an
implicit
and
an
explicit
assumption
but
it
really
seems
to
me
to
color
their
arguments.
there
is
another
assumption
that
seems
to
me
that
color
their
arguments
and
that
is
that
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
conditions
turns
not
on
what
the
law
or
the
statute
requires
that
they'd
be
given
but
what
they
would
like
to
have
and
i'm
going
to
sum
it
again
on
that.
what
i
suggest
is
there's
nothing
in
this
--
in
either
of
these
assumptions.
the
commission
has
found
that
they
are
entitled
to
this
protection
and
the
commission
has
said
it's
going
to
give
it
to
them
and
it's
not
retracted
in
anyway
from
that
--
at
least
drawn
from
that
position.
now,
if
in
this
hearing
on
the
protective
conditions,
assuming
the
merger
is
consummated,
conditions
are
prescribed
which
these
protected
lines
don't
like.
they
unlike
the
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
have
the
right
of
judicial
review.
i
suggest
if
the
reviewing
court
finds
that
the
conditions
that
the
commission
has
prescribed
do
not
satisfy
the
commission's
own
findings
as
to
what
is
required
and
remands
the
court
--
the
case
to
the
commission
to
do
a
better
job
that
the
commission
will
do
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
white,
what
i
really
suggest
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
isn't
it
more
--
i
suppose
the
question
is
more
likely
whether
the
commission
would
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
know
it's
happened
[laughter]
but
it
has
been
my
observation
that
the
agencies
as
a
whole
are
likely
to
take
the
admonitions
that
they
derive
perhaps
by
inference
from
the
reviewing
opinions
with
a
fair
degree
gravity
and
by
now.
in
theory,
i
think
this
could
happen
but
as
judge
friendly
said
in
the
court
below,
this
notion
of
an
infinite
regression
of
endless
passage
of
the
case
back
and
forth
from
between
court
and
agencies,
i
think
that
rather
improbable
hypothesis.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
are
you
asking
mr.
chief
justice
for
an
estimate
as
to
the
time
to
take
the
matter
through
the
commission
and
ends
through
a
judicial
review?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
you
had
an
estimate
from
mr.
ginnane
about
the
time
that
would
take
in
the
commission.
i
think
he
said
the
first
june
or
something
of
that
kind.
that's
my
recollection.
now,
what
time
would
be
consumed
after
that
in
judicial
review
is
difficult
to
say.
i
will
--
i
point
out
as
you've
observed
sir
that
this
case
has
been
handled
very
expeditiously.
judge
friendly
in
that
court
below
handled
it
expeditiously
and
goes
back
to
the
same
course,
i
assume
it
would
be.
i
would
expect
that
it
would
handle
it
expeditiously
again
but
i
would
assume
in
june
that
the
best
we
could
hope
for
would
be
perhaps
another
decision
by
this
court
sometime
next
term,
but
that's
a
very
rough
guess.
i
might
better
of
course
--
you
must
remember
that
the
way
this
argument
is
shaping
up,
it
seems
likely
that
there
maybe
not
one
set
of
plaintiffs
in
that
review
proceeding
but
two,
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
d&h
will
say
the
conditions
don't
do
enough.
the
norfolk
and
western
and
the
c&o
will
probably
be
there
saying
they
do
too
much.
so
it
will
be
another
case
where
there
will
be
these
conflicting
problems
and
that
they're
complicate
it
but
that's
the
best
i
can
do
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
other
arguments
that
the
erie
and
the
d&h
made
about
the
necessity
for
postponing
this
merger
while
the
protective
conditions
are
being
finally
determined.
it
seem
to
me
they
take
two
lines.
in
the
first
place,
they
suggest
that
in
the
interim
period,
while
the
commission
and
the
courts
are
considering
these
conditions,
they
won't
really
get
effective
protections.
they
say
that
the
traffic
conditions
which
will
be
in
effect
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
they're
not
really
effective,
but
no
one
knows
what
they
mean.
again,
i
invite
the
court
to
read
appendix
g.
that
appendix
starts
out
with
a
direction
that
says,
that
penn-central
shall
not
change
or
establish
any
rate
or
practice
or
service
or
engage
in
any
other
practice
that
changes
the
status
quo
where
the
effect
would
likely
to
divert
traffic
from
these
two
protected
railroads.
now
that
categorical
in
that
first
paragraph
is
followed
by
five
sub-paragraphs
in
which
the
commission
says,
by
way
of
illustration
and
not
of
limitation
this
is
what
you
must
do
and
this
is
what
you
must
not
do.
now,
i
suggest
by
any
standards
of
particularity
and
precision
and
clarity
that
are
reasonable
that
appendix
will
effective
certainly
if
it
--
where
it
contains
as
it
might
well
be
by
so
far
as
this
content
is
concerned
and
the
decree
of
a
court
of
equity,
i
cannot
believe
anyone
would
say
that
the
decree
was
so
vague
as
to
be
in
effect.
there
are
just
two
other
observations
i
will
make
about
this
argument
about
the
traffic
conditions
being
in
effect.
the
d&h
i
think
their
counsel
have
said
representatives
of
pennsylvania
have
made
conflicting
statements
of
different
times
about
what
the
traffic
conditions
mean.
i
think
that
those
statements
have
read
in
context
that
they
appear
as
they
are
not
really
basically
inconsistent,
but
i
think
that
that's
irrelevant.
pennsylvania
isn't
going
to
construe
these
conditions.
the
commission
has
said
to
these
carriers,
you
must
comply
with
these
conditions
and
you
must
comply
with
spirit
of
not
only
the
letter
and
it
provided
a
summary
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
i.c.c.
may
make
--
yes,
it's
reconsidering
in
the
sense
that
it
may
make
changes
in
them
but
in
the
meantime,
these
traffic
conditions
are
in
effect.
these
are
the
mergers
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i'm
prepared
to
conceive
if
they
had
been
completely
satisfied
with
the
traffic
conditions.
they
wouldn't
have
added
the
indemnity
provisions
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
are
you
asking
me
sir
whether
there's
anything
the
commission
could
do
that
would
--
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
you
must
--
may
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
let
me
make
this
point
which
may
or
may
not
allay
some
of
your
doubts.
i
assume
you
realize
that
the
commission
has
said
that
the
indemnity
provision
which
is
a
provision
for
financial
payments
will
be
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
now,
the
other
point
that
i
should
like
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
we
know
that
indemnity
provision
will
compensate
the
roads
on
some
basis
for
any
diversion
of
traffic
if
it
occurs
despite
the
traffic
condition.
now,
there
is
another
point
that
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
here
which
was
made
yesterday
and
that
is
that
the
record
before
the
commission
demonstrated
that
the
effects
on
these
unprotected
lines
of
the
merger
would
not
occur
immediately.
mr.
white,
the
chief
executive
of
the
delaware
and
hudson
testified
before
the
commission
that
it
would
be
a
year
before
the
effects
of
the
merger
would
probably
begin
to
be
felt
by
the
d&h.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
understand
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
understand
and
my
--
our
position
is
of
having
said
that
and
having
considered
the
problem
on
petitions
for
reconsideration
of
the
commission,
again
determined
that
it
could
and
would
protect
these
lines
as
its
basic
finding
required
it
to
do
even
though
it
involves
some
change
in
these
conditions.
and
mind
you,
as
far
as
the
protected
liens
were
concerned
what
they
were
asking
for
were
improvements
and
the
commission's
report
on
reconsideration
says
that
the
penn-pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
said
that
they
would
have
no
objection
to
improvements
that
were
designed
to
strengthen
the
protection
to
these
lines
and
they
waive
the
right
to
judicial
review
as
opposed
to
traffic
conditions
in
the
indemnity
pleading.
i
submit
that
in
those
circumstances
where
the
commission
feeling
if
there
were
valid
reasons
for
public
interest
for
going
ahead
with
this
merger
that
the
measures
it
took
to
comply
with
its
basic
finding
and
to
provide
relief
for
these
carriers
were
added.
another
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
protected
carriers
which
is,
i
think
a
branch
of
their
argument
that
these
traffic
conditions
will
not
be
effective
is
an
argument
that
is
directed
perhaps
to
the
--
one
of
the
commission's
reasons
for
saying
that
the
merger
should
be
consummated
promptly
and
that
is
that
if
the
traffic
conditions
are
effective
then
the
savings
contemplated
by
the
merger
cannot
be
affected
while
the
traffic
conditions
are
in
effect
and
therefore,
there's
no
reason
to
prompt
the
compensation.
now,
this
is
related
to
a
matter
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
fortas
because
that
argument
rests
on
two
misconceptions.
one
is
that
these
savings
are
going
to
start
accruing
immediately
in
substantial
amounts
and
that
the
service
will
be
improve
as
a
result
immediately
to
mergers
made
--
that
commission
did
not
make
findings
that
kind
of
view
the
matter
that
way.
it
takes
time
to
these
things.
the
problem
here
on
consummation
is
when
are
these
railroads
to
be
allowed
to
start
because
before
you
can
do
any
of
these
things
that
get
into
a
point
where
they
are
producing
the
results
that
are
in
the
public
interest,
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
time.
now
therefore,
the
suggestion
that
because
the
penn-central
suggested
from
or
prevented
from
diverting
traffic
from
the
two
lines,
they
will
not
be
able
to
make
any
of
the
start
of
these
improvements
that
will
ultimately
savings
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
record.
about
half
of
these
savings,
ultimately
will
be
accomplished
by
consolidations
or
reconstructions
or
expansions
or
contractions
of
terminal
facility
and
that
can
be
done
without
diverting
--
you
can
start
on
that
work
without
diverting
any
traffic
from
these
protected
lines
or
without
in
any
way
violating
appendix
g.
the
selkirk
yard
which
was
mentioned
yesterday
is
a
good
example.
that's
going
to
take
months
at
least
and
perhaps
years
to
really
get
started
on
that
job.
that's
a
big
job,
and
if
roads
are
allowed
to
consummate
this
merger,
they
can
start
on
that
work
without
diverting
any
traffic
at
all.
there
a
suggestion
is
also
been
made
that
it
is
not
possible
to
really
prescribe
any
conditions
that
will
effectively
protect
these
roads
in
the
interim
period.
now,
the
interesting
difference
in
view
among
the
road
--
the
appellants
about
that,
i
don't
understand,
at
least
the
erie
and
the
d&h
seem
to
me
approach
that
argument
somewhat
gingerly,
they
indicated
points
if
they
have
some
doubts
but
they
don't
embrace
it
whole
heatedly.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
seem
to
think
that
the
commission
could
lawfully
devise
effective
conditions
in
this
reopened
hearing.
at
least
he
said
that
the
commission
has
the
obligation
and
the
authority
to
hammer
out
a
solution.
it
is
the
norfolk
and
western
and
the
b&o
who
say
that
the
commission
cannot
lawfully
devise
any
conditions
that
will
really
protect
these
three
railroads.
of
course,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
avoid
the
impressions
with
that
and
i
suppose
this
is
patent
in
their
argument
that
this
is
not
a
contention
that's
prompted
solely
by
the
solicitor
with
the
interest
of
those
rail
roads.
the
argument
is
that
these
protective
conditions
with
the
indemnity
provisions
specifically
are
an
unlawful
pooling
arrangement.
the
e&h
and
the
--
the
erie
and
the
delaware
and
hudson
specifically
have
rejected
that
notion
in
their
brief
taken
before
the
commission,
and
we
think
the
right
for
four
reasons
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i'd
rather
not
go
into
detail
here
but
we
think
that
it
is
clear
from
those
reasons
that
the
indemnity
provisions
prescribed
by
the
commission
in
the
first
place
and
any
indemnity
provision
that
maybe
prescribed
in
the
future
will
not
be
unlawful
as
unauthorized
pulling
arrangement.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it's
a
question
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
part
mr.
justice
fortas
is
simply
a
question
of
law.
we
think
you
can
look
at
the
indemnity
provision
that
was
prescribed
and
see
on
its
faces
not
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
we
don't
know
what
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
but
presumably
and
i
use
that
word
recognizing
the
weakness
in
it,
the
indemnity
provision
will
have
the
same
--
some
of
the
same
characteristics
as
the
one
that
exists.
if
there
is
any
change,
the
change
is
more
likely
to
be
a
change
that
would
remove
even
the
basis
for
the
argument
of
illegality.
in
the
inclusion
proceedings,
there
was
some
suggestion
that
the
way
to
provide
indemnity
was
not
on
this
formula
basis
which
is
now
done,
but
by
on
time
of
day
basis.
now,
if
you
do
that,
the
whole
pooling
argument
obviously
collapses.
so
my
response
is
that
if
there's
a
change
as
far
as
illegality
is
concerned,
i
think
it
would
almost
certainly
be
regarded
the
change
for
the
better.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
there
is
such
an
argument,
again
which
we
have
dealt
with
again
in
our
brief
and
i
will
say
this
about
it.
i
think
our
answer
hinges
in
large
part
on
the
responses
i
made
your
question
about
our
reading
of
the
findings
made
by
the
commission.
now
in
addition,
we
have
pointed
out
you
know
in
our
brief
that
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice
many
times
has
found
that
a
transaction
of
this
kind
will
have
or
may
have
adverse
effects
on
employees
and
has
approved
the
transaction
nonetheless
reserving
for
later
decision,
the
exact
character
and
content
of
the
conditions
that
should
be
attached
to
take
care
of
those
adverse
effects.
we
have
cited
other
cases
in
the
brief
including
rock
island
truck
case
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
commission
can
issue
a
motor
carriage
certificate
to
a
railroad
and
validly
reserve
the
right
later
to
attach
conditions
to
that
certificate
to
make
sure
that
it
complies
with
the
statutory
standard.
this
--
the
--
we
submit
that
if
you
look
at
section
5(2)
and
the
words
of
section
5(2)
that
the
section
does
not
impose
any
absolute
and
categorical
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
commission
to
approve
a
transaction
on
condition
which
it
specified
in
the
terms
it
has
here
and
at
the
same
time
reserving
the
right
to
give
content
or
to
change,
revise
the
conditions
in
--
subsequently
in
ways
that
are
consistent
with
its
original
basic
finding.
that
is
the
only
legal
argument
that
i'm
aware
of
that
has
been
made
in
this
case
about
the
commissions'
lack
of
authority.
in
the
remaining
time,
though
i
think
it's
–
the
matter
has
been
perhaps
adequately
covered,
at
least
some
aspects
of
it
by
mr.
ginnane,
i
want
now
to
speak
briefly
to
the
other
problem
and
it
is
whether
this
transaction
should
be
--
consummations
should
be
delayed
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
on
the
question
of
the
inclusion
of
the
three
smaller
railroads
in
some
larger
system.
the
--
erie
doesn't
make
this
argument
at
all.
the
d&h
made
it
in
its
brief
but
i
understood
that
yesterday
its
counsel
to
modify
that
stand
to
say
somewhat,
and
to
say
that
possibly
once
the
protective
conditions
were
determined,
they
might
be
satisfied.
this
is
an
argument
that
is
really
pressed
and
pressed
vigorously
by
the
norfolk
and
western.
and
i
think
it's
important
and
mr.
ginnane's
touch
on
this
to
understand
just
what
that
position
is
and
what
it
means.
this
is
the
position
of
norfolk
and
western
and
the
c&o.
the
position
is
that
these
three
roads
should
not
and
cannot
be
taken
in
to
the
independent
n&w
system.
they
have
resisted
that
in
the
proceeding
before
mr.
commissioner
webb.
they
have
indicated
that
they're
going
to
file
exceptions
to
his
report
and
i
assume
if
the
commission
firms
that
report,
they
will
seek
judicial
review.
that's
the
first
step.
the
next
step
is
that
they
say
these
three
railroads
cannot
be
included
in
the
penn-central
merger
because
that
would
create
a
rail
monopoly
in
doing
it.
so
they
say,
the
inevitable
consequence
is
that
these
three
railroads
can
only
be
taken
care
of
if
the
commission
will
approve
that
both
n&w
and
c&o
merger,
and
as
a
necessary
corollary
of
that
conclusion
they
say
that
if
the
commission
cannot
approve
the
n&w
and
c&o
merger
and
thereby
provide
a
home
for
these
small
lines
then
penn-central
merger
should
never
be
consummated.
and
they
have
taken
that
position
frankly
as
i
understand
it
in
the
conclusions
or
in
the
reopened
petition
hearing
on
the
conditions.
so
that
this
is
an
argument
and
approach
which
not
only
involves
protracted
delay
as
mr.
ginnane
has
pointed
out,
but
it's
a
delay
which
is
entertained
or
indulged
in
with
a
specific
possibility
in
the
mind
that
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
delay,
there
will
be
no
penn-central
merger
at
all.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
will
the
egg
be
unscrambled?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
it
would
be
--
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
time
which
i
find
it
difficult
to
estimate
but
i
would
suppose
that
certainly
within
two
years,
the
unscrambling
would
not
be
too
difficult
and
my
clients
have
told
me
that
it
can
be
unscrambled
and
they
realize
that
if
this
merger
is
consummated
they
may
have
to
unscramble
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
can't
give
you
a
date
specific
with
that.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--probably
something.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
it
might
well
be
something
in
that
area,
but
i
must
--
i'm
obliged
to
say
that
i
have
not
obtained
information
with
that
specific
about
the
--
but
the
--
as
far
as
the
physical
facilities
and
that
kind
of
thing
are
concerned,
there
will
be
a
considerable
period
of
time
as
i
indicated
previously
when
this
thing
could
be
unscrambled
and
they
realize
that
and
of
course
unscrambling
--
the
only
people
who
will
be
hurt
by
unscrambling
are
my
clients.
nobody
else
would
be
hurt,
it
has
to
be
done,
not
a
prospect
to
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
public
would
be
yes
[laughter]
but
i'm
assuming
that
some
responsible
tribunal
has
decided
that
the
public
would
be
better
off
without
the
merger
and
in
that
event,
if
that
decision
has
been
made
definitively
then
the
only
people
who
are
hurt
are
my
clients.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
as
independent
railroad,
yes,
because
the
report
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that
is
their
choice
of
course.
they
can
do
it
if
they
like.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
not
unless
they
wish
to
liquidate,
which
of
some
railroads
in
new
england
have
done
entirely
voluntarily,
but
they
have
done
but
you're
quite
right.
the
commission
faced
the
fact
that
these
three
railroads
would
have
to
be
absorbed
in
a
larger
system
and
found
nevertheless
that
this
merger
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i'm
not
--
i
think
in
the
sense
that
issue
is
here,
yes.
i
think
what
the
commission
has
--
the
complaint
in
the
commission
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
these
railroads
must
be
absorbed
in
a
larger
system
and
of
course
the
commission
has
at
the
present
time
at
least
two
options
in
that
respect.
one
being
independent
n&w
and
one
being
the
penn-central.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
certainly
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
arguments
would
be
--
the
arguments
delay
until
termination
of
the
condition
is
much
more
powerful
and
persuasive
argument
than
the
argument
for
this
other
delay.
this
other
delay
if
you
have
taken
to
the
point
which
is
taken
in
the
n&w
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that
the
problem
--
we
must
remember
this
about
the
inclusion
proceeding,
it
raises
essentially
considerations
of
private
as
opposed
to
public
interest.
what
i
mean
by
that
--
the
commission
is
found
that
the
continuance
of
the
transportation
services
of
these
three
railroads
is
in
the
public
interest
and
they
should
be
preserved.
now,
in
the
inclusion
proceeding,
the
question
really
is
what
terms
and
conditions
refer
so
far
as
the
stockholders
and
the
competitors
perhaps
of
this
company.
sir,
now
as
to
that
i
suggest
that
the
risks
are
not
great
since
the
commission
from
those
instances
has
complete
authority
both
to
norfolk
and
western
and
the
penn-central
if
the
merger
is
consummated
have
agreed
that
they're
bound
to
take
these
roads
if
the
commission
finds
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
that
either
one
should
and
fix
this
terms
that
are
fair
in
equity
so
that
they
have
no
choice
on
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
shouldn't
have
to
take
them
but
he
has
indicated
that
the
penn-central
might
well
have
to
take
them
and
the
commission
has
provided
that
in
case
that
time
that
b&m
can
now
apply
for
inclusion
in
the
penn-central.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
apparently
don't
think
so
because
they
haven't
appealed.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
have
announced
that
they
are
satisfied
that
one
way
or
another
the
commission
will
take
care
of
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
that
raises
the
question
of
what
extent
delay
would
imperil
this
merger.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
can't
be
dogmatic
about
that.
i
can't
be
nearly
as
confident
and
dogmatic
on
my
side
of
the
argument
as
my
opponents
are
on
theirs.
they
say
this
merger
i
gather
will
hold
together
for
anything
with
time.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
long
it
is.
now,
i
can't
be
that
confident
on
my
side.
i
can
say
there's
a
risk.
my
clients
would
want
to
go
through
with
this
merger.
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
and
money
trying
to
do
it
and
they're
going
to
try
to
preserve
it.
but
the
longer
the
delay
and
particularly
if
the
delay
is
accompanied
by
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
merger
will
ever
take
place,
the
longer
that
goes
on,
the
greater
the
risk
because
they
can't
continue
living
in
limbo,
they
have
for
four
years
and
this
thing
is
done
on
a
stock
ratio
for
change
and
it
is
very
difficult,
as
circumstances
change
and
they
have
been
changing
to
preserve
those
stock
ratios
indefinitely
and
that's
not
entirely
within
the
management's
control.
and
if
they
change
that
ratio
by
agreement
then
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
and
get
approval
and
there'll
be
more
hearings.
how
long
they
will
last
and
what
issues
will
be
raised
--
will
depend
upon
who
intervenes
and
what
issues
they
try
to
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
what?
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
fearless
in
what
sanction
mr.
justice
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
are
you
speaking
now
of
the
arguments
advanced
by
mr.
keyserling
and
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
merger
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
technically
that
there
would
still
be
an
opportunity
to
argue
perhaps
everything
and
certainly,
there
would
be
the
--
there
wold
be
an
opportunity
for
the
argument
to
be
made
with
the
commissions'
basic
findings
who
did
not
satisfy
the
statute
to
find
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
of
course
we
know
--
i
think
i
can
say
it
with
some
confidence
how
that
would
come
out
in
the
court
below.
that
was
briefed,
mr.
keyserling
and
mr.
macdougall
briefed
this
to
judge
friendly.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
right.
but
one
of
the
questions
on
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
held
that
looking
at
those
findings,
the
plaintiffs
who
are
attacking
them
have
no
reasonable
prospect
of
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it
did
little
more
than
that
if
you
read
judge
friendly's
opinion.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
he
regarded
those
arguments
so
--
and
substantially
didn't
want
to
spend
any
time
on
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
it
is
--
that
was
a
responsibility
of
the
plaintiffs
who
are
attacking
the
findings.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
court
--
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
the
court
is
entitled
to
take
the
facts
to
step
forth
and
reports
to
the
commission
and
then
reports
--
and
then
report
the
examiner's
work.
that's
the
old
mississippi
value
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
sorry.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
--
i
think
really
--
i'm
making
one
other
comment
then
i'm
over
with
my
time.
i
think
when
you
examine
the
arguments
made
by
mr.
keyserling
and
mr.
macdougall
there
are
arguments
that
are
not
addressed
so
much
to
the
bottom
of
the
evidence
as
they
are
to
the
nature
of
the
findings
to
exercise
the
judgment
that
the
commissioners
demonstrated
in
the
findings.
their
arguments
can
be
measured
on
the
face
of
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
so
far.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
those
were
the
--
they
had
full
opportunity
to
make
arguments.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
parties
who
are
attacking
here
made
all
of
the
arguments
below
that
they
made
here.
now,
i
understood
mr.
keyserling
in
one
point
which
i
agree
with
him
to
say
that
he
would
like
to
have
this
court
decide
finally
and
i
think
the
question
is
right
for
decision
where
those
findings
were
good
and
i
agree
with
him.
i
checked
--
and
since
i
like
to
have
the
question
decided.
he
is
not
going
to
do
--
it's
an
exercise
in
futility
and
i
say
this
with
to
the
conviction
to
send
that
question
back
to
the
three-judge
court.
even
judge
winfield
didn't
dissent
on
that
ground.
my
time
is
done.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
new
york
central
in
this
case.
there
are
two
problems
here.
one
is
the
problem
whether
the
commission's
finding
that
this
merger
is
in
the
public
interest
is
valid
and
should
be
sustained.
that
is
the
point
to
which
the
arguments
in
the
city
of
scranton,
and
mr.
shapp
directed
yesterday.
the
other
question
is
whether
assuming
that
the
finding
of
the
mergers
in
public
interest
is
valid,
the
merger
should
be
consummated
now
or
at
some
differed
time,
it
was
at
that
point
the
arguments
of
the
carrier
appellants
were
directed
yesterday.
i
should
like
to
begin
by
saying
a
little
about
the
arguments
that
were
made
against
the
merits
of
the
commissions'
decision
as
to
the
public
interest
element
of
this
merger.
in
our
brief,
we
have
questioned
the
standing
of
mr.
shapp
and
the
city
of
scranton
to
raise
these
points.
i
should
like
to
rely
upon
that
discussion
in
the
brief
and
to
leave
that
point
in
that
posture.
in
our
brief,
we
have
also
discussed
the
merits
of
those
attacks
upon
the
findings
of
the
commission.
and
again
in
large
part,
i
should
prefer
to
rely
upon
that
discussion
in
the
brief
as
to
the
merits
of
the
attack.
but
there
are
one
or
two
comments
that
i
should
like
to
make
about
the
arguments
that
were
made
yesterday
about
the
commission's
findings.
and
i
shall
begin
by
commenting
on
mr.
keyserling's
arguments
or
at
least
the
main
branch
of
his
argument
which
involved
it
seem
to
me
two
related
ideas,
closely
related.
one
was
that
the
commission
had
not
given
proper
consideration
or
attached
enough
weight
to
the
improved
financial
position
of
these
two
carriers
in
1964
and
1965
and
that
the
other
was
that
the
commissions'
order
was
invalid
because
in
the
event,
it
turned
out
that
projections
that
mr.
keyserling
made
about
traffic
volumes
in
1964
and
1965
were
a
great
deal
better
as
indeed
they
were
than
in
traffic
projections
that
were
offered
in
the
evidence
by
the
two
railroads.
now,
these
arguments
are
related
because
i
understand
mr.
keyserling's
position
on
economics
it
is
the
1964
and
1965
refers
on
a
chart
that
should
gone
up
and
mr.
keyserling
believes,
of
course
he
is
an
eminent
columnist.
he
is
good
--
entitled
consideration.
these
curves
are
going
to
keep
on
going
up
and
up
and
the
railroads
here
involved
are
going
to
enjoy
prosperity
that
will
follow
from
the
rise
of
these
curves.
now
the
fact
is
that
the
commission
considered
that
arguments
so
that
it
can't
be
said
that
the
commission
ignored
it.
it
had
before
it
the
figures
as
to
1964
and
1965.
it
made
two
points
about
this
argument.
in
the
first
place
it
said
that
looking
at
the
historical
record,
it
was
not
prepared
to
accept
the
idea
that
the
curves
were
going
--
to
keep
going
up
and
up
and
up
without
any
deviation.
but
it
said
apart
from
that
that
even
if
it
accepted,
even
if
it
accept
the
projections
that
mr.
keyserling
had
made,
that
did
not
change
its
views
about
it's
basic
findings
because
on
the
record
that
the
satisfied
--
that
the
historical
record
again
that
the
railroads
was
not
necessarily,
at
least
two
railroads
particularly
share
proportionately
and
even
in
a
great
degree
these
increases
in
a
national
prosperity.
now,
this
is
all
in
the
finding
and
the
commission
supported
that
--
these
detailed
findings
pointing
out
even
in
these
two
years
which
were
years
of
unprecedented
at
least
in
recent
years
of
income
for
these
two
railroads
their
rates
of
return.
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
were
slightly
less
or
not
more
than
2%
or
too
low
by
any
--
even
by
conservative
standards
and
indeed
were
lower
than
the
return
you
could
get
on
government
bonds.
it
reviewed
and
made
findings
about
others
financial
facts
relating
to
the
conditions
of
these
railroads
in
the
pre-historical
period
of
time
covered
by
the
findings,
pointing
out
for
over
a
period
of
time
their
rates
of
return,
this
is
a
finding
made
by
the
examiners,
confirmed
by
the
commission,
their
rates
of
return
were
less
than
2%,
about
1.77%
over
a
period
of
12
years.
there
was
a
period
of
five
years
immediately
preceding
the
decision
when
these
two
railroads
did
not
have
enough
net
income,
net
income
from
their
own
railway
operations
to
pay
their
fix
charges.
in
those
years,
they
have
not
had
income
from
activities
that
were
not
related
to
their
own
railroad
operations,
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
pay
those
fix
charges.
now,
i
submit
on
that
basis
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
commission
ignored
mr.
keyserling's
arguments
and
that
they
ignored
the
facts
on
which
he
bases
those
arguments.
he
is
entitled
to
be
verified
by
his
success
of
profit
on
the
traffic
volume
but
i
submit
that
under
the
normal
standards
of
traffic
--
of
judicial
review
the
question
here
is
not
whether
mr.
keyserling
is
wiser
than
the
interstate
commerce
commissioners
in
terms
of
economic
theory
but
whether
the
commission
made
adequate
finding
based
on
substantial
evidence
which
it
did
in
this
case.
now,
i
only
want
to
try
and
comment
briefly
on
one
other
point
that
was
made
in
this
connection
which
has
to
do
with
the
argument
made
by
mr.
macdougall
for
mr.
shapp
and
again,
i'm
going
to
rely
largely
on
what
was
said
in
the
brief.
that
argument
suggests
that
the
commission
and
the
examiners
made
an
error
of
law
because
they
didn't
understand
the
public
interest
standard
laid
down
in
section
5(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if
the
members
of
the
court
will
look
at
the
examiners'
report
and
the
commission's
report,
it
will
appear
that
what
the
examiners
and
the
commission
did
was
to
comply
strictly
with
the
definitions
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
louden
case
and
in
the
new
york
securities
company
case
and
in
cases
which
have
been
decided
since
the
transportation
act
of
1940
was
decided.
the
other
statutes
such
as
the
appalachian
region
relief
act
(ph)
that
mr.
macdougall
talked
about
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
section
5(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
what
mr.
macdougall's
complaint
really
is,
i
think
that
he
again
believes
that
the
commission
didn't
give
proper
attention
to
the
effects
of
this
merger
on
the
certain
communities
in
pennsylvania.
i
respectfully
invite
the
court
again
to
look
what
the
examiners
did,
what
the
commission
did
in
terms
of
findings
about
pennsylvania.
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
is
not
here.
it's
now
supporting
the
merger
in
that
sense.
those
findings
are
detailed
and
they
show
that
commission
the
most
cheerful
consideration
on
the
facts
to
what
the
merger
effect
would
have
on
the
transportation
services
and
facilities
available
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
found
on
the
basis
of
those
detailed
findings
with
evidence
to
support
them
that
would
benefit
pennsylvania
and
not
--
now
with
that,
i
should
like
to
leave
the
questions
of
merits
and
move
to
the
matter
that
was
chiefly
subject
to
discussion
yesterday
which
is
when
should
this
merger
be
consummated.
the
commission
has
twice
found
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
for
the
merger
to
be
consummated
halfway.
it
made
that
finding
first
in
its
initial
report
in
connection
with
its
discussion
of
the
protective
conditions
that
it
was
prescribing
for
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
boston
and
maine.
it
made
it
again
more
detailed
in
its
report
on
reconsiderations.
mr.
ginnane
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
bet
that
i
could
not
accept
that
characterization
of
what
it
found.
i
read
its
report
and
i'm
referring
now
to
the
pages
i
think
there
in
327
i.c.c.
531
and
532.
i
read
those
pages
containing
findings
of
this
kind.
the
commission
said,
it
will
not
be
in
the
public
interest
to
consummate
this
merger
unless
there
are
protective
conditions
that
will
preserve
the
status
quo
and
prevent
these
three
railroads
from
having
their
service
impaired
by
the
diversion
of
traffic
to
diverge
10%
that
is
basic
finding.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there's
no
dispute
about
that
and
the
commission
has
never
withdrawn
from
or
modified
or
retracted
in
anyway
that
finding.
and
the
commission
went
ahead
and
said
to
this
end
as
i
construe
their
opinion,
to
this
end,
we
say
that
it
may
be
consummated
now
subject
to
the
conditions
that
we
specifically
set
out
in
appendix
g.
now,
the
only
thing
that's
been
reopened
in
this
proceeding
is
a
question
of
what,
if
anything
should
be
done
with
respect
to
the
specific
conditions
that
the
commission
prescribed.
the
commission
did
not
tamper
with
its
basic
finding
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
reopen
the
proceeding
largely
because
the
protected
lines
came
in
and
said
we
want
more,
we
want
better
protection
and
the
commission
said,
alright,
we'll
have
a
look
at
that.
but
that's
--
that
is
my
instruction
to
that
--
of
what
the
commission
did.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
said
also
yes
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
going
to
hurt
us.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
commission
would
have
done
with
that
in
the
absence
of
the
other
but
that
was
in
the
picture
and
the
hearings
that
cover
that
point
too
as
well
as
some
other
lines.
cnnj
is
in
that
position.
they're
having
a
hearing
on
that
point.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
perhaps
i
should
say
a
word
if
i
may
about
the
cnnj.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
central
of
new
jersey.
[laughter]
as
it
is
been
said
here,
the
--
that
railroad,
the
central
of
new
jersey,
did
not
try
to
intervene
in
this
proceeding
and
it
did
not
present
any
evidence
to
the
examiners
during
the
original
hearing,
just
stayed
out.
there
was
however,
and
what
i'm
saying
now
is
all
in
this
brief
to
look
in
the
appendix,
there
was
some
evidence
however
before
the
examiners
about
the
attitude
of
the
central
of
new
jersey
towards
the
merger
because
the
state
of
pennsylvania
which
was
collecting
evidence
at
that
point
to
oppose
the
merger
wrote
to
the
central
of
new
jersey
a
letter
and
said,
“what
about
it?
is
this
going
to
hurt
you?”
and
mr.
shoemaker
who
was
then
is
now
the
president
of
central
of
new
jersey
wrote
a
letter
back
and
said,
“no.
we
have
no
grounds
for
opposing
this
merger.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
going
to
improve
our
interchange
position
because
it
strengthens
the
position
of
the
merged
carrier.”
now
that's
what
the
commission
had
before
it
as
far
as
the
central
of
new
jersey
was
concerned
at
that
point.
now,
after
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
at
that
point,
the
new
haven
was
a
subject
of
argument
in
the
hearings.
after
it
became
and
seemed
to
be
likely
that's
a
new
haven
and
this
was
really
after
the
hearings
had
been
closed
except
on
the
matter
of
labor
conditions,
after
the
hearing
had
been
closed
to
that
extent
with
the
labor
condition
still
open,
one
of
the
periods
of
new
haven
might
be
included.
the
central
of
new
jersey
came
along
and
said
we
would
like
to
intervene
and
said
we'd
like
to
intervene
solely
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
in
this
merger
will
injure
us,
that's
the
only
point.
they
didn't
talk
about
the
things
that
mr.
cutler
has
been
talking
about
today.
and
the
examiners
or
the
commission
said,
“alright,
you
can
intervene
but
we
don't
--
we're
not
going
to
reopen
this
proceeding
at
this
point
to
take
evidence
about
what
new
haven
will
do
to
you
because
that
whole
matter
is
going
to
be
handled
in
a
hearing
about
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven.”
now
their
hearing
about
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven
starts
next
monday
and
that
central
of
new
jersey
as
prior
to
that
hearing
and
one
of
the
issues
is
what
kind
of
protection
shall
be
given
to
the
central
of
new
jersey,
prevent
traffic
diversion
as
a
result
of
the
inclusion
of
the
new
haven.
now
the
central
of
new
jersey
after
that
did
nothing
until
the
examiners
had
made
--
they're
prepared
with
proposed
report
and
then
it
came
along
and
filed
exceptions.
now,
i
must
say
that
in
those
exceptions,
it
indicated
that
it
was
rather
unhappy
about
the
merger,
but
it
was
rather
vague
about
it
--
not
anyone
is
interested.
i
would
like
the
court
to
look
at
this
document
because
it
made
some
complaints
about
it
but
it
didn't
propose
any
specific
conditions
for
its
protection.
it
didn't
ask
to
be
included
in
anything.
it
complains
--
so
far
as
it
complains
only
about
two
specific
things.
one
was
the
new
haven
inclusion
and
the
other
was
a
proposal
that
the
examiners
had
made
that
the
pennsylvania
should
be
required
to
give
the
d&h
some
traffic
rights
in
connection
with
this
merger.
and
the
commission
dealt
with
those
things
in
its
initial
report
and
said,
“alright,
you
get
a
hearing
on
whether
there
is
going
to
be
any
diversion
of
traffic
from
--
by
the
new
haven
in
the
new
haven
proceeding
and
that
this
trackage
right
thing
has
to
be
done
by
a
contract
which
we
have
to
approve
and
you
will
get
a
hearing
and
the
hearing
on
that
contract
on
what
should
be
done
in
connection
with
the
trackage
rights
to
prevent
diversion
of
your
traffic.
so
i
submit
that
up
to
last
july-august
when
the
central
of
new
jersey
filed
its
petition
for
reconsideration
here,
the
commission
has
afforded
the
hearing
on
the
only
complaint
of
this
railroad
that
was
specifically
made.
now,
this
thing
that
i
devoted
too
much
time
to
but
i
want
to
say
one
thing
more
because
--
and
then
i
should
finish.
mr.
cutler's
portrait
of
the
central
of
new
jersey
is
wasted
to
his
wondering
on
administrative
wasteland
where
no
man
comes
is
a
little
less
heartrending
i
think
to
read
his
brief
carefully
because
it's
apparent
that
what
the
central
of
new
jersey
is
really
saying
is
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
will
solve
our
problem,
is
to
approve
the
b&o
and
n&w
and
the
c&o
merger.
it's
true
we
have
these
prosperous
relatives,
the
b&o
and
c&o
and
the
--
but
do
they
not
--
going
to
give
us
any
money
unless
the
commission
approves
this
larger
plan.
so
this
argument,
i
think
it's
apparent
in
what
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
argument
is.
now,
i
should
like
to
move
on
to
the
question
which
i
think
is
the
important
question
here
and
it
affects
the
railroads
to
the
protected
railroads
who
really
may
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
this
and
i
think
the
arguments
entitled
serious
consideration
and
that
is
the
question
whether
this
merger
should
be
differed
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
on
the
protective
condition.
because
i
think
if
that
is
essentially
the
position
of
the
erie
and
the
d&h,
and
in
view
of
the
commission's
finding
about
what
will
be
done
to
them
by
the
merger
and
the
importance
of
their
service
is,
their
arguments
are
entitled
to
serious
consideration
and
this
is
a
serious
problem.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
merger
should
not
be
differed
pending
that
determination.
i
think
that
there
seems
to
me
to
underline
the
arguments
of
the
d&h
and
erie
in
assumption
that
if
it
is
not
deferred,
they
are
not
going
to
get
this
full
protection
from
the
commission
in
form
of
these
conditions
as
they
would
if
the
merger
is
deferred.
that
is
more
of
an
implicit
and
an
explicit
assumption
but
it
really
seems
to
me
to
color
their
arguments.
there
is
another
assumption
that
seems
to
me
that
color
their
arguments
and
that
is
that
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
conditions
turns
not
on
what
the
law
or
the
statute
requires
that
they'd
be
given
but
what
they
would
like
to
have
and
i'm
going
to
sum
it
again
on
that.
what
i
suggest
is
there's
nothing
in
this
--
in
either
of
these
assumptions.
the
commission
has
found
that
they
are
entitled
to
this
protection
and
the
commission
has
said
it's
going
to
give
it
to
them
and
it's
not
retracted
in
anyway
from
that
--
at
least
drawn
from
that
position.
now,
if
in
this
hearing
on
the
protective
conditions,
assuming
the
merger
is
consummated,
conditions
are
prescribed
which
these
protected
lines
don't
like.
they
unlike
the
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
have
the
right
of
judicial
review.
i
suggest
if
the
reviewing
court
finds
that
the
conditions
that
the
commission
has
prescribed
do
not
satisfy
the
commission's
own
findings
as
to
what
is
required
and
remands
the
court
--
the
case
to
the
commission
to
do
a
better
job
that
the
commission
will
do
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
white,
what
i
really
suggest
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
isn't
it
more
--
i
suppose
the
question
is
more
likely
whether
the
commission
would
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
know
it's
happened
[laughter]
but
it
has
been
my
observation
that
the
agencies
as
a
whole
are
likely
to
take
the
admonitions
that
they
derive
perhaps
by
inference
from
the
reviewing
opinions
with
a
fair
degree
gravity
and
by
now.
in
theory,
i
think
this
could
happen
but
as
judge
friendly
said
in
the
court
below,
this
notion
of
an
infinite
regression
of
endless
passage
of
the
case
back
and
forth
from
between
court
and
agencies,
i
think
that
rather
improbable
hypothesis.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
are
you
asking
mr.
chief
justice
for
an
estimate
as
to
the
time
to
take
the
matter
through
the
commission
and
ends
through
a
judicial
review?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
you
had
an
estimate
from
mr.
ginnane
about
the
time
that
would
take
in
the
commission.
i
think
he
said
the
first
june
or
something
of
that
kind.
that's
my
recollection.
now,
what
time
would
be
consumed
after
that
in
judicial
review
is
difficult
to
say.
i
will
--
i
point
out
as
you've
observed
sir
that
this
case
has
been
handled
very
expeditiously.
judge
friendly
in
that
court
below
handled
it
expeditiously
and
goes
back
to
the
same
course,
i
assume
it
would
be.
i
would
expect
that
it
would
handle
it
expeditiously
again
but
i
would
assume
in
june
that
the
best
we
could
hope
for
would
be
perhaps
another
decision
by
this
court
sometime
next
term,
but
that's
a
very
rough
guess.
i
might
better
of
course
--
you
must
remember
that
the
way
this
argument
is
shaping
up,
it
seems
likely
that
there
maybe
not
one
set
of
plaintiffs
in
that
review
proceeding
but
two,
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
d&h
will
say
the
conditions
don't
do
enough.
the
norfolk
and
western
and
the
c&o
will
probably
be
there
saying
they
do
too
much.
so
it
will
be
another
case
where
there
will
be
these
conflicting
problems
and
that
they're
complicate
it
but
that's
the
best
i
can
do
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
other
arguments
that
the
erie
and
the
d&h
made
about
the
necessity
for
postponing
this
merger
while
the
protective
conditions
are
being
finally
determined.
it
seem
to
me
they
take
two
lines.
in
the
first
place,
they
suggest
that
in
the
interim
period,
while
the
commission
and
the
courts
are
considering
these
conditions,
they
won't
really
get
effective
protections.
they
say
that
the
traffic
conditions
which
will
be
in
effect
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
they're
not
really
effective,
but
no
one
knows
what
they
mean.
again,
i
invite
the
court
to
read
appendix
g.
that
appendix
starts
out
with
a
direction
that
says,
that
penn-central
shall
not
change
or
establish
any
rate
or
practice
or
service
or
engage
in
any
other
practice
that
changes
the
status
quo
where
the
effect
would
likely
to
divert
traffic
from
these
two
protected
railroads.
now
that
categorical
in
that
first
paragraph
is
followed
by
five
sub-paragraphs
in
which
the
commission
says,
by
way
of
illustration
and
not
of
limitation
this
is
what
you
must
do
and
this
is
what
you
must
not
do.
now,
i
suggest
by
any
standards
of
particularity
and
precision
and
clarity
that
are
reasonable
that
appendix
will
effective
certainly
if
it
--
where
it
contains
as
it
might
well
be
by
so
far
as
this
content
is
concerned
and
the
decree
of
a
court
of
equity,
i
cannot
believe
anyone
would
say
that
the
decree
was
so
vague
as
to
be
in
effect.
there
are
just
two
other
observations
i
will
make
about
this
argument
about
the
traffic
conditions
being
in
effect.
the
d&h
i
think
their
counsel
have
said
representatives
of
pennsylvania
have
made
conflicting
statements
of
different
times
about
what
the
traffic
conditions
mean.
i
think
that
those
statements
have
read
in
context
that
they
appear
as
they
are
not
really
basically
inconsistent,
but
i
think
that
that's
irrelevant.
pennsylvania
isn't
going
to
construe
these
conditions.
the
commission
has
said
to
these
carriers,
you
must
comply
with
these
conditions
and
you
must
comply
with
spirit
of
not
only
the
letter
and
it
provided
a
summary
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
i.c.c.
may
make
--
yes,
it's
reconsidering
in
the
sense
that
it
may
make
changes
in
them
but
in
the
meantime,
these
traffic
conditions
are
in
effect.
these
are
the
mergers
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i'm
prepared
to
conceive
if
they
had
been
completely
satisfied
with
the
traffic
conditions.
they
wouldn't
have
added
the
indemnity
provisions
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
are
you
asking
me
sir
whether
there's
anything
the
commission
could
do
that
would
--
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
you
must
--
may
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
let
me
make
this
point
which
may
or
may
not
allay
some
of
your
doubts.
i
assume
you
realize
that
the
commission
has
said
that
the
indemnity
provision
which
is
a
provision
for
financial
payments
will
be
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
now,
the
other
point
that
i
should
like
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
we
know
that
indemnity
provision
will
compensate
the
roads
on
some
basis
for
any
diversion
of
traffic
if
it
occurs
despite
the
traffic
condition.
now,
there
is
another
point
that
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
here
which
was
made
yesterday
and
that
is
that
the
record
before
the
commission
demonstrated
that
the
effects
on
these
unprotected
lines
of
the
merger
would
not
occur
immediately.
mr.
white,
the
chief
executive
of
the
delaware
and
hudson
testified
before
the
commission
that
it
would
be
a
year
before
the
effects
of
the
merger
would
probably
begin
to
be
felt
by
the
d&h.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
understand
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
understand
and
my
--
our
position
is
of
having
said
that
and
having
considered
the
problem
on
petitions
for
reconsideration
of
the
commission,
again
determined
that
it
could
and
would
protect
these
lines
as
its
basic
finding
required
it
to
do
even
though
it
involves
some
change
in
these
conditions.
and
mind
you,
as
far
as
the
protected
liens
were
concerned
what
they
were
asking
for
were
improvements
and
the
commission's
report
on
reconsideration
says
that
the
penn-pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
said
that
they
would
have
no
objection
to
improvements
that
were
designed
to
strengthen
the
protection
to
these
lines
and
they
waive
the
right
to
judicial
review
as
opposed
to
traffic
conditions
in
the
indemnity
pleading.
i
submit
that
in
those
circumstances
where
the
commission
feeling
if
there
were
valid
reasons
for
public
interest
for
going
ahead
with
this
merger
that
the
measures
it
took
to
comply
with
its
basic
finding
and
to
provide
relief
for
these
carriers
were
added.
another
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
protected
carriers
which
is,
i
think
a
branch
of
their
argument
that
these
traffic
conditions
will
not
be
effective
is
an
argument
that
is
directed
perhaps
to
the
--
one
of
the
commission's
reasons
for
saying
that
the
merger
should
be
consummated
promptly
and
that
is
that
if
the
traffic
conditions
are
effective
then
the
savings
contemplated
by
the
merger
cannot
be
affected
while
the
traffic
conditions
are
in
effect
and
therefore,
there's
no
reason
to
prompt
the
compensation.
now,
this
is
related
to
a
matter
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
fortas
because
that
argument
rests
on
two
misconceptions.
one
is
that
these
savings
are
going
to
start
accruing
immediately
in
substantial
amounts
and
that
the
service
will
be
improve
as
a
result
immediately
to
mergers
made
--
that
commission
did
not
make
findings
that
kind
of
view
the
matter
that
way.
it
takes
time
to
these
things.
the
problem
here
on
consummation
is
when
are
these
railroads
to
be
allowed
to
start
because
before
you
can
do
any
of
these
things
that
get
into
a
point
where
they
are
producing
the
results
that
are
in
the
public
interest,
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
time.
now
therefore,
the
suggestion
that
because
the
penn-central
suggested
from
or
prevented
from
diverting
traffic
from
the
two
lines,
they
will
not
be
able
to
make
any
of
the
start
of
these
improvements
that
will
ultimately
savings
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
record.
about
half
of
these
savings,
ultimately
will
be
accomplished
by
consolidations
or
reconstructions
or
expansions
or
contractions
of
terminal
facility
and
that
can
be
done
without
diverting
--
you
can
start
on
that
work
without
diverting
any
traffic
from
these
protected
lines
or
without
in
any
way
violating
appendix
g.
the
selkirk
yard
which
was
mentioned
yesterday
is
a
good
example.
that's
going
to
take
months
at
least
and
perhaps
years
to
really
get
started
on
that
job.
that's
a
big
job,
and
if
roads
are
allowed
to
consummate
this
merger,
they
can
start
on
that
work
without
diverting
any
traffic
at
all.
there
a
suggestion
is
also
been
made
that
it
is
not
possible
to
really
prescribe
any
conditions
that
will
effectively
protect
these
roads
in
the
interim
period.
now,
the
interesting
difference
in
view
among
the
road
--
the
appellants
about
that,
i
don't
understand,
at
least
the
erie
and
the
d&h
seem
to
me
approach
that
argument
somewhat
gingerly,
they
indicated
points
if
they
have
some
doubts
but
they
don't
embrace
it
whole
heatedly.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
seem
to
think
that
the
commission
could
lawfully
devise
effective
conditions
in
this
reopened
hearing.
at
least
he
said
that
the
commission
has
the
obligation
and
the
authority
to
hammer
out
a
solution.
it
is
the
norfolk
and
western
and
the
b&o
who
say
that
the
commission
cannot
lawfully
devise
any
conditions
that
will
really
protect
these
three
railroads.
of
course,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
avoid
the
impressions
with
that
and
i
suppose
this
is
patent
in
their
argument
that
this
is
not
a
contention
that's
prompted
solely
by
the
solicitor
with
the
interest
of
those
rail
roads.
the
argument
is
that
these
protective
conditions
with
the
indemnity
provisions
specifically
are
an
unlawful
pooling
arrangement.
the
e&h
and
the
--
the
erie
and
the
delaware
and
hudson
specifically
have
rejected
that
notion
in
their
brief
taken
before
the
commission,
and
we
think
the
right
for
four
reasons
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i'd
rather
not
go
into
detail
here
but
we
think
that
it
is
clear
from
those
reasons
that
the
indemnity
provisions
prescribed
by
the
commission
in
the
first
place
and
any
indemnity
provision
that
maybe
prescribed
in
the
future
will
not
be
unlawful
as
unauthorized
pulling
arrangement.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it's
a
question
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
part
mr.
justice
fortas
is
simply
a
question
of
law.
we
think
you
can
look
at
the
indemnity
provision
that
was
prescribed
and
see
on
its
faces
not
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
we
don't
know
what
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
but
presumably
and
i
use
that
word
recognizing
the
weakness
in
it,
the
indemnity
provision
will
have
the
same
--
some
of
the
same
characteristics
as
the
one
that
exists.
if
there
is
any
change,
the
change
is
more
likely
to
be
a
change
that
would
remove
even
the
basis
for
the
argument
of
illegality.
in
the
inclusion
proceedings,
there
was
some
suggestion
that
the
way
to
provide
indemnity
was
not
on
this
formula
basis
which
is
now
done,
but
by
on
time
of
day
basis.
now,
if
you
do
that,
the
whole
pooling
argument
obviously
collapses.
so
my
response
is
that
if
there's
a
change
as
far
as
illegality
is
concerned,
i
think
it
would
almost
certainly
be
regarded
the
change
for
the
better.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
there
is
such
an
argument,
again
which
we
have
dealt
with
again
in
our
brief
and
i
will
say
this
about
it.
i
think
our
answer
hinges
in
large
part
on
the
responses
i
made
your
question
about
our
reading
of
the
findings
made
by
the
commission.
now
in
addition,
we
have
pointed
out
you
know
in
our
brief
that
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice
many
times
has
found
that
a
transaction
of
this
kind
will
have
or
may
have
adverse
effects
on
employees
and
has
approved
the
transaction
nonetheless
reserving
for
later
decision,
the
exact
character
and
content
of
the
conditions
that
should
be
attached
to
take
care
of
those
adverse
effects.
we
have
cited
other
cases
in
the
brief
including
rock
island
truck
case
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
commission
can
issue
a
motor
carriage
certificate
to
a
railroad
and
validly
reserve
the
right
later
to
attach
conditions
to
that
certificate
to
make
sure
that
it
complies
with
the
statutory
standard.
this
--
the
--
we
submit
that
if
you
look
at
section
5(2)
and
the
words
of
section
5(2)
that
the
section
does
not
impose
any
absolute
and
categorical
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
commission
to
approve
a
transaction
on
condition
which
it
specified
in
the
terms
it
has
here
and
at
the
same
time
reserving
the
right
to
give
content
or
to
change,
revise
the
conditions
in
--
subsequently
in
ways
that
are
consistent
with
its
original
basic
finding.
that
is
the
only
legal
argument
that
i'm
aware
of
that
has
been
made
in
this
case
about
the
commissions'
lack
of
authority.
in
the
remaining
time,
though
i
think
it's
–
the
matter
has
been
perhaps
adequately
covered,
at
least
some
aspects
of
it
by
mr.
ginnane,
i
want
now
to
speak
briefly
to
the
other
problem
and
it
is
whether
this
transaction
should
be
--
consummations
should
be
delayed
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
on
the
question
of
the
inclusion
of
the
three
smaller
railroads
in
some
larger
system.
the
--
erie
doesn't
make
this
argument
at
all.
the
d&h
made
it
in
its
brief
but
i
understood
that
yesterday
its
counsel
to
modify
that
stand
to
say
somewhat,
and
to
say
that
possibly
once
the
protective
conditions
were
determined,
they
might
be
satisfied.
this
is
an
argument
that
is
really
pressed
and
pressed
vigorously
by
the
norfolk
and
western.
and
i
think
it's
important
and
mr.
ginnane's
touch
on
this
to
understand
just
what
that
position
is
and
what
it
means.
this
is
the
position
of
norfolk
and
western
and
the
c&o.
the
position
is
that
these
three
roads
should
not
and
cannot
be
taken
in
to
the
independent
n&w
system.
they
have
resisted
that
in
the
proceeding
before
mr.
commissioner
webb.
they
have
indicated
that
they're
going
to
file
exceptions
to
his
report
and
i
assume
if
the
commission
firms
that
report,
they
will
seek
judicial
review.
that's
the
first
step.
the
next
step
is
that
they
say
these
three
railroads
cannot
be
included
in
the
penn-central
merger
because
that
would
create
a
rail
monopoly
in
doing
it.
so
they
say,
the
inevitable
consequence
is
that
these
three
railroads
can
only
be
taken
care
of
if
the
commission
will
approve
that
both
n&w
and
c&o
merger,
and
as
a
necessary
corollary
of
that
conclusion
they
say
that
if
the
commission
cannot
approve
the
n&w
and
c&o
merger
and
thereby
provide
a
home
for
these
small
lines
then
penn-central
merger
should
never
be
consummated.
and
they
have
taken
that
position
frankly
as
i
understand
it
in
the
conclusions
or
in
the
reopened
petition
hearing
on
the
conditions.
so
that
this
is
an
argument
and
approach
which
not
only
involves
protracted
delay
as
mr.
ginnane
has
pointed
out,
but
it's
a
delay
which
is
entertained
or
indulged
in
with
a
specific
possibility
in
the
mind
that
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
delay,
there
will
be
no
penn-central
merger
at
all.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
will
the
egg
be
unscrambled?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
it
would
be
--
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
time
which
i
find
it
difficult
to
estimate
but
i
would
suppose
that
certainly
within
two
years,
the
unscrambling
would
not
be
too
difficult
and
my
clients
have
told
me
that
it
can
be
unscrambled
and
they
realize
that
if
this
merger
is
consummated
they
may
have
to
unscramble
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
can't
give
you
a
date
specific
with
that.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--probably
something.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
it
might
well
be
something
in
that
area,
but
i
must
--
i'm
obliged
to
say
that
i
have
not
obtained
information
with
that
specific
about
the
--
but
the
--
as
far
as
the
physical
facilities
and
that
kind
of
thing
are
concerned,
there
will
be
a
considerable
period
of
time
as
i
indicated
previously
when
this
thing
could
be
unscrambled
and
they
realize
that
and
of
course
unscrambling
--
the
only
people
who
will
be
hurt
by
unscrambling
are
my
clients.
nobody
else
would
be
hurt,
it
has
to
be
done,
not
a
prospect
to
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
public
would
be
yes
[laughter]
but
i'm
assuming
that
some
responsible
tribunal
has
decided
that
the
public
would
be
better
off
without
the
merger
and
in
that
event,
if
that
decision
has
been
made
definitively
then
the
only
people
who
are
hurt
are
my
clients.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
as
independent
railroad,
yes,
because
the
report
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that
is
their
choice
of
course.
they
can
do
it
if
they
like.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
not
unless
they
wish
to
liquidate,
which
of
some
railroads
in
new
england
have
done
entirely
voluntarily,
but
they
have
done
but
you're
quite
right.
the
commission
faced
the
fact
that
these
three
railroads
would
have
to
be
absorbed
in
a
larger
system
and
found
nevertheless
that
this
merger
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i'm
not
--
i
think
in
the
sense
that
issue
is
here,
yes.
i
think
what
the
commission
has
--
the
complaint
in
the
commission
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
these
railroads
must
be
absorbed
in
a
larger
system
and
of
course
the
commission
has
at
the
present
time
at
least
two
options
in
that
respect.
one
being
independent
n&w
and
one
being
the
penn-central.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
certainly
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
arguments
would
be
--
the
arguments
delay
until
termination
of
the
condition
is
much
more
powerful
and
persuasive
argument
than
the
argument
for
this
other
delay.
this
other
delay
if
you
have
taken
to
the
point
which
is
taken
in
the
n&w
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that
the
problem
--
we
must
remember
this
about
the
inclusion
proceeding,
it
raises
essentially
considerations
of
private
as
opposed
to
public
interest.
what
i
mean
by
that
--
the
commission
is
found
that
the
continuance
of
the
transportation
services
of
these
three
railroads
is
in
the
public
interest
and
they
should
be
preserved.
now,
in
the
inclusion
proceeding,
the
question
really
is
what
terms
and
conditions
refer
so
far
as
the
stockholders
and
the
competitors
perhaps
of
this
company.
sir,
now
as
to
that
i
suggest
that
the
risks
are
not
great
since
the
commission
from
those
instances
has
complete
authority
both
to
norfolk
and
western
and
the
penn-central
if
the
merger
is
consummated
have
agreed
that
they're
bound
to
take
these
roads
if
the
commission
finds
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
that
either
one
should
and
fix
this
terms
that
are
fair
in
equity
so
that
they
have
no
choice
on
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
shouldn't
have
to
take
them
but
he
has
indicated
that
the
penn-central
might
well
have
to
take
them
and
the
commission
has
provided
that
in
case
that
time
that
b&m
can
now
apply
for
inclusion
in
the
penn-central.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
apparently
don't
think
so
because
they
haven't
appealed.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
have
announced
that
they
are
satisfied
that
one
way
or
another
the
commission
will
take
care
of
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
that
raises
the
question
of
what
extent
delay
would
imperil
this
merger.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
can't
be
dogmatic
about
that.
i
can't
be
nearly
as
confident
and
dogmatic
on
my
side
of
the
argument
as
my
opponents
are
on
theirs.
they
say
this
merger
i
gather
will
hold
together
for
anything
with
time.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
long
it
is.
now,
i
can't
be
that
confident
on
my
side.
i
can
say
there's
a
risk.
my
clients
would
want
to
go
through
with
this
merger.
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
and
money
trying
to
do
it
and
they're
going
to
try
to
preserve
it.
but
the
longer
the
delay
and
particularly
if
the
delay
is
accompanied
by
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
merger
will
ever
take
place,
the
longer
that
goes
on,
the
greater
the
risk
because
they
can't
continue
living
in
limbo,
they
have
for
four
years
and
this
thing
is
done
on
a
stock
ratio
for
change
and
it
is
very
difficult,
as
circumstances
change
and
they
have
been
changing
to
preserve
those
stock
ratios
indefinitely
and
that's
not
entirely
within
the
management's
control.
and
if
they
change
that
ratio
by
agreement
then
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
and
get
approval
and
there'll
be
more
hearings.
how
long
they
will
last
and
what
issues
will
be
raised
--
will
depend
upon
who
intervenes
and
what
issues
they
try
to
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
what?
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
fearless
in
what
sanction
mr.
justice
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
are
you
speaking
now
of
the
arguments
advanced
by
mr.
keyserling
and
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
merger
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
technically
that
there
would
still
be
an
opportunity
to
argue
perhaps
everything
and
certainly,
there
would
be
the
--
there
wold
be
an
opportunity
for
the
argument
to
be
made
with
the
commissions'
basic
findings
who
did
not
satisfy
the
statute
to
find
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
of
course
we
know
--
i
think
i
can
say
it
with
some
confidence
how
that
would
come
out
in
the
court
below.
that
was
briefed,
mr.
keyserling
and
mr.
macdougall
briefed
this
to
judge
friendly.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
right.
but
one
of
the
questions
on
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
held
that
looking
at
those
findings,
the
plaintiffs
who
are
attacking
them
have
no
reasonable
prospect
of
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it
did
little
more
than
that
if
you
read
judge
friendly's
opinion.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
he
regarded
those
arguments
so
--
and
substantially
didn't
want
to
spend
any
time
on
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
it
is
--
that
was
a
responsibility
of
the
plaintiffs
who
are
attacking
the
findings.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
court
--
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
the
court
is
entitled
to
take
the
facts
to
step
forth
and
reports
to
the
commission
and
then
reports
--
and
then
report
the
examiner's
work.
that's
the
old
mississippi
value
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
sorry.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
--
i
think
really
--
i'm
making
one
other
comment
then
i'm
over
with
my
time.
i
think
when
you
examine
the
arguments
made
by
mr.
keyserling
and
mr.
macdougall
there
are
arguments
that
are
not
addressed
so
much
to
the
bottom
of
the
evidence
as
they
are
to
the
nature
of
the
findings
to
exercise
the
judgment
that
the
commissioners
demonstrated
in
the
findings.
their
arguments
can
be
measured
on
the
face
of
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
so
far.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
those
were
the
--
they
had
full
opportunity
to
make
arguments.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
parties
who
are
attacking
here
made
all
of
the
arguments
below
that
they
made
here.
now,
i
understood
mr.
keyserling
in
one
point
which
i
agree
with
him
to
say
that
he
would
like
to
have
this
court
decide
finally
and
i
think
the
question
is
right
for
decision
where
those
findings
were
good
and
i
agree
with
him.
i
checked
--
and
since
i
like
to
have
the
question
decided.
he
is
not
going
to
do
--
it's
an
exercise
in
futility
and
i
say
this
with
to
the
conviction
to
send
that
question
back
to
the
three-judge
court.
even
judge
winfield
didn't
dissent
on
that
ground.
my
time
is
done.
