mr.
edward
w.
bourne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
erie-lackawanna
which
is
the
largest
and
usually
the
first
named
of
the
three
so-called
protected
railroads.
now
our
case
here,
and
our
case
below,
is
very,
very
narrow
as
been
the
case
that
was
put
to
you
by
mr.
trienens.
we
are
in
the
anomalous
position
here
in
that
the
norfolk
&
western
and
those
affiliated
with
it
have
a
very
broad
program
with
which
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
d
&
h
and
counsel
for
the
d
&
h
who
will
follow
on
me
do
not
agree.
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
while
mr.
trienens
said
higher
in
the
court
in
thinking
that
the
commission
should
not
have
been
sustained.
mr.
trienens
and
i
disagree
a
great
deal
about
many
of
the
things
that
he
had
said
to
you.
another
thing
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
we
have
--
we
stand
on
specific
findings.
we
stand
on
a
specific
course
that
was
followed.
we
stand
on
specific
statutes
as
made
--
seen
to
be
a
dry
approach
to
this
case.
but
erie-lackawanna
is
an
important
railway.
it
isn't
as
if
it
was
some
trolley
line
that
had
to
die
so
that
progress
should
go
ahead.
it
serves
the
country
from
the
port
of
new
york
to
chicago
on
its
own
lines
with
buffalo
and
immediate
cities.
it
serves
--
it
go
--
it
reaches
to
st.
louis
through
connections
and
then
of
course
its
traffic
to
interchange
all
over
the
country.
its
revenue
last
year
--
in
1965
were
approximately
$230
million
neither
is
the
d
&
h
who
were
following
the
--
a
railroad
that
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
unemployed.
i
will
say
no
more
about
their
importance
because
the
commission
unanimously
found
that
they
were
essential
unanimously
and
i
don't
see
why
since
nobody
challenges
those
findings.
i
should
take
the
time
of
this
court
to
say
that
they're
supported
by
the
record.
i
want
to
mention
two
other
points
of
explicit
disagreement
with
mr.
trienens.
but
first
of
all,
we
do
not
agree
that
the
provisions
for
and
indemnification
condition
was
an
illegal
pool
under
section
5
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
testimony
on
that
subject
at
the
adjourned
hearings
for
which
the
condition
provided
has
been
taken.
mr.
trienens
introduces
a
testimony
of
an
emily
gail,
professor
and
does
not
introduce
cross
examination
of
the
(inaudible).
briefs
haven't
yet
been
filed.
the
question
is
to
whether
that's
an
illegal
pool
hardly
seems
to
me
the
day
before
the
court
because
actually
at
the
present
time
there
is
no
indemnification
condition.
any
decision
by
this
court
on
that
subject
would
be
a
many
of
something
that
doesn't
yet
exist
in
the
light
of
inadequate
argument.
he
spoke
also
of
the
capital
indemnity
issue.
i
would
like
to
say
on
that
that
while
i
do
not
minimize
its
importance
it
is
not
been
mention
in
any
document
filed
by
erie-lackawanna
with
this
court.
our
appeal
has
been
based
squarely
and
exclusively
on
points
that
were
raised
below
and
our
emphasis
has
been
on
the
so-called
protective
conditions.
and
what
happen
to
them
and
i
will
tell
you
that
as
briefly
as
i
can.
i
want
to
assure
you
that
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
new
haven
but
in
the
way
i
have
lined
things
up
here
i
don't
come
to
it
right
off
of
the
bat
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
--
because
it
seems
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
on
findings
of
the
commission
and
on
statutes
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
now
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
our
position
on
that
is
this
mr.
justice
white.
that's
what
we
would
like
and
we
think
that
would
be
just
but
our
ancestors
in
our
pages
has
been
on
the
protective
conditions.
is
that
a
fair
answer?
i
don't
want
to
give
up
the
position
that
we
wouldn't
like
to
be
included?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
all
that
--
we
aren't
asking
for
it.
but
we
have
not
argued
that
any
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we
have
not
argued
that.
i
think
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
don't
like
--
i
think
i
don't
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
what?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
no,
i
don't
want
to
argue
it.
i
want
to
say
that
we
would
be
very
happy
with
that
and
we've
asked
for
it.
but
our
argument
is
based
upon
what
the
commission
did
with
respect
to
the
protective
conditions.
now,
those
are
--
you've
been
told
something
about
them,
two
of
the
lawyers
--
by
both
lawyers
mentioned
what
is
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
three.
and
that
is
the
one
on
page
--
the
bottom
at
page
18
of
our
brief
which
says,
"it
is
doubtful
there
without
inclusion
that
a
major
system,
these
three
carries
that
withstand
the
competition
of
the
applicants
converged
and
unless
they
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
there
future
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
of
merger
at
this
time
even
though
approving
the
merger".
then
the
commission
went
on
to
say,
“our
pool
other
than
merger
for
undelayed
consummation
shall
be
subject
therefore
to
the
conditions
specifically
described
in
appendix
g”.
now,
an
argument
is
made
by
one
of
the
counsels
for
one
of
the
appellees
that
all
the
commission
said
is,
“well,
they've
got
to
be
protected
in
some
way
or
other".
that
is
not
correct.
and
isn't
there
that
there
are
pool
was
subject
to
the
conditions
specifically
described
in
appendix
g
and
it
then
went
on
to
make
the
mandatory
statutory
findings
that
obvious
relations,
direct
relation
to
what
it
had
previously
found.
so
long
the
basis
of
the
appendices
had
found
the
conditions
to
be
just
and
reasonable
which
is
the
statutory
language.
now,
what
happened?
when
we
have
an
opportunity
to
study
what
they
had
done
and
mr.
trienens
is
completely
direct
in
saying
that
the
were
no
advance
nor
was
there
any
kind
whatsoever
that
this
type
of
thing
was
even
under
consideration
with
no
hearing,
no
opportunity
for
argument,
nothing
was
done
within
the
walls
of
the
building
where
the
commission
sit
as
its
offices
by
whoever
did
it.
we've
studied
them
and
we
felt
that
they
were
very
seriously
defective
both
in
substance
and
in
form.
on
july
8,
reason
to
believe
we
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration
in
which
after
untold
hours
of
work
we
tried
to
refrain
in
such
a
way
as
to
do
what
we
thought
should
be
done.
answers
were
due
at
least
to
two
of
those
petitions.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
petitions
on
the
first
of
august.
the
last
come
in
on
the
8th
of
august,
a
very
short
one.
commission
did
nothing.
they
just
--
the
papers
just
sat
there.
then
many
times
we
have
this
sort
of
damage
at
least
to
the
effective
date.
if
and
when
the
order
became
effective,
the
merger
could
go
right
--
quite
through
and
it
was
announced
to
the
papers
that
they
have
established
sixty
or
more
men
getting
already
to
put
it
to.
our
first
effort
to
get
--
or
one
of
our
efforts
to
get
an
extension
of
the
effective
date
was
successful
because
the
commission
said
that
it
immediate
--
have
time
to
consider
these
petitions.
it
said
nothing
about
allowing
us
time
for
judicial
review
which
was
what
we
asked
for.
by
the
8th
of
september
we
were
in
this
position.
our
petition
was
on
file,
nothing
had
happen.
we
have
the
september
30
effective
date.
we
had
to
figure
out
how
much
time
is
--
was
going
to
take
to
protect
our
rights
and
we
decided
we
couldn't
wait
anymore
and
we
filed
papers
and
that's
how
this
suit
started.
after
the
suit
has
started,
two
days
before
the
argument
in
the
three-judge
court,
two
days
before
the
argument
in
the
three-judge
court
out
came
the
commission's
further
order.
the
september
the
16th
actually
released
on
september
19th.
the
last
further
order
said
and
i
think
i
should
read
this
because
i
--
this
is
very,
very
important.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
sir?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
further
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
further
order,
further.
the
commission
said
that
the
petitioners
had
raised
valid
issues.
the
three
protected
carriers,
that's
the
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h
and
whom
you
hear
and
b
&
m
to
whom
we
won't
hear.
the
three
protected
carriers
on
petition
have
raised
valid
issues
as
to
the
interpretation,
application,
scope
and
other
aspects
of
the
protection.
so
the
commission
provided
that
there
should
be
further
hearings
and
they
said
that
until
the
traffic
conditions
which
were
extraordinarily
complex
extremely
important
and
in
our
view,
very
defective.
they
were
to
remain
operative
until
or
further
ordered.
the
other
condition,
the
indemnification
condition
which
was
the
mr.
trienens
has
mentioned
was
ascended
in
its
entirety.
and
the
commission
said,
“though
or
indicative
that
if
it
were
reinstated
or
if
any
were
reinstated
that
would
be
retroactive
to
the
days
of
consummation”.
and
then
the
commission
said,
“go
ahead
with
the
consummation”.
and
our
position
is
that
there
are
no
findings
in
that
september
16
report
which
can
conceivably
be
cited
as
justifying
what
the
commission
did.
even
if
it
--
he
had
assumed
that
the
fact
that
the
commission
did
what
it
thought
had,
what
it
had
to
do
implied
that
it
thought
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
it
gave
no
reasons
at
all
to
amount
anything
certainly
not
as
to
the
protected
conditions
except
to
say
that
all
these
issues
has
been
raised.
now,
i
think
that
the
--
that
our
case
--
by
our
case
i
am
talking
to
the
erie-lackawanna
case
and
the
d
&
h
case
was
magnificently
summarized
in
an
opinion
of
judge
weinfeld
who
dissented
below.
this
is
not
an
opinion.
in
this
case
this
is
an
opinion
in
a
following
case
which
i
think
is
now
before
this
court
brought
by
new
haven's
farm
holders.
he
concurred
there
with
it,
judge
brody
and
judge
levet.
but
he
distinguishes
between
that
case
and
this
case
in
these
words
and
these
sums
up
our
case
better
than
i
can
do
it.
in
the
erie
case,
the
commission
has
found
that
the
public
interest
required
protection
of
the
three
carriers
against
the
adverse
effect
of
a
merger
and
as
a
condition
of
consummation
imposed
specific
protective
terms
which
are
subsequently
revoked
ex
parte
in
my
view
without
adequate
supporting
findings
as
to
one
condition
and
lesser
future
determination
as
to
others.
the
terms
and
conditions
as
originally
delineated
by
the
commission
where
a
city
quite
known
of
the
merger.
now,
where
are
we
now?
we
have
the
appendix
g
traffic
condition.
i'm
assuming
for
example
that
this
court
reverses,
the
--
affirms
the
lower
court
and
the
merger
goes
through
on
february
1,
where
would
we
be?
we
would
have
these
appendix
g
traffic
conditions.
how
good
are
they?
we
say
they
are
no
good,
practically.
and
nobody
has
ever
answered
our
criticisms
that
its
statement
includes
the
commission.
it
includes
that
the
court
below.
it
includes
the
appellees.
they
don't
want
to
take
to
answer
them.
is
our
main
--
to
our
main
brief
rather
than
bore
the
court
with
a
great
long
discussion
of
this
topic,
this
subject.
we
dealt
with
it
very
deeply
in
the
bottom
of
--
body
of
the
brief,
pages
41
and
43.
and
then
in
appendix
d,
we
discussed
some
of
the
major
defects,
no
answer.
now,
mr.
silleck
has
dealt
with
this
subject
in
his
briefs
more
fully
than
i
have.
so,
i'm
not
going
to
go
on
with
that
on
with
that.
i
am
confident
as
to
what
you
--
that
you
get
the
whole
story
before
the
deal
is
over.
now,
as
to
the
--
as
the
indemnification
condition,
where
we
stand
on
that?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
the
indemnification
conditions.
judge
weinfeld
says,
"none
can
define
what
will
happen".
nobody
can
define
what
would
happen.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
it.
we
didn't
--
we
thing
we've
made
it
a
good
case
for
it
at
these
hearings
which
are
recently
been
held.
they
were
held
before,
an
examiner
who
had
no
authority.
he
didn't
undertake
to
express
any
opinion.
these
are
going
to
be
filed,
what
do
we
going
to
have?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
of
the
most
recent
hearings?
well,
i
was
really
expect
the
decision
--
i
think
that
the
first
decision
it
will
be
on
so-called
capital
indemnity
which
is
heard
first.
and
then
the
second
decision
would
be
on
items
1
and
2
and
i
would
be
really
surprised
if
that
was
not
down
by
let
say,
the
first
of
april.
the
second
--
the
reply
briefs
are
due
--
the
sixth
of
february
--
to
the
sixth
of
february.
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
wasn't
down
with
it
by
the
first
of
april.
you
realize
of
course
mr.
justice
harlan
that
mr.
trienens
and
his
(inaudible)
may
challenge
it,
indemnification
condition
even
if
we're
entirely
content
with
it.
there
may
be
a
connection
say
you
can
have
this
going.
now,
i
think
you
just
tolerate
to
ask
whether
the
question
of
power
was
raised.
the
answer
is
yes.
we
questioned
the
commission's
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case.
now,
the
--
appellees
say
that
we
are
arguing
that
every
detail
of
every
condition
in
every
by
to
transaction
has
to
be
put
down
the
last
of
defining
debt.
we
make
no
such
argument.
we
say
that
then
--
and
i
think
they
must
agree
that
the
limit
beyond
this
recognition
can't
go.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well,
i
would
think
so,
yes,
for
this
one.
i've
seen
two
lights.
i
think
that
means
i'm
done
with
the
(inaudible).
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
what
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
they
cite
authorities
with
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
am
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
reserving
10
minutes
to
reply,
i
have
four
minutes
now
and
i
will
try
to
cover
my
ground
in
four
minutes.
i
would
simply
like
to
refer
to
the
discussions
of
our
briefs
of
the
re
--
statements
by
the
commission
that
these
two
railroads
were
invulnerable
and
highly
sensitive
financial
condition
to
railroads,
it
made
a
$122
million
in
1965.
i
would
like
also
call
attention
to
the
point
that
deals
with
all
the
reasons
the
commission
gave
for
prompt
consummation.
and
finally
to
the
point
--
the
effect
of
the
court
below
really
base
its
decision
to
a
considerable
degree
on
suppositions
and
conjectures
that
had
absolutely
no
support
in
the
record.
now
as
to
the
new
haven,
i
cannot
tell
you
and
i
don't
think
it's
my
--
really
my
job
to
tell
you
all
about
new
haven.
i
will
come
to
that.
our
position
is
this,
they
requested
deferment
until
the
protected
conditions
are
determined
even
if
judicial
review
is
involved,
involves
no
threat
to
the
new
haven
as
you
could
measure,
no
treat
to
the
new
haven.
i
think
the
threat
to
the
new
haven
if
even
deferring
until
we
are
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western
would
be
very
slight.
the
reason
the
commission
did
what
it
did
was
because
it
would
not
find
out
what
the
facts
were.
and
in
our
petition
to
reconsideration
we
asked
them
to
find
out
more
about
new
haven.
all
they
were
told
was
that
new
haven
was
in
a
desperate
condition.
that
it
had
to
be
a
penn-central
merger
to
save
the
new
haven,
repeated
and
repeated,
repeated
with
no
explanation
of
the
connection
between
the
penn-central
merger
and
the
new
haven.
and
they
decided
that
was
right
and
refused
to
find
out.
now,
i
feel
that
since
the
new
haven
trustees
and
the
four
states
have
a
total
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
they
together
have
an
obligation
to
tell
this
court,
first,
what
is
really
required
to
bring
about
the
inclusion
of
new
haven?
mr.
justice
harlan
wondered
whether
they
were
only
procedural
points.
the
answer
isn't
they're
not
only
procedural
points.
they
are
very
substantive
points
involving
both
this
proceeding
and
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
reorganization
proceeding.
how
long
will
it
take
to
guesses
below
were
up
to
two
years.
well,
my
own
view
is
that's
optimistic.
and
finally
in
this
i
think
is
crucial,
why
and
how
and
to
what
extent
will
a
deferment
of
penn-central
merger
have
any
effect
on
the
solution
to
the
new
haven
problem.
now,
there's
no
answer
to
say
that
the
new
haven
is
in
desperate
condition.
it's
out
of
cash.
it
may
not
have
enough
cash
to
survive
and
so
forth.
unless
you
show
that
by
jeopardizing
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
delaware
and
hudson,
you're
going
to
save
the
new
haven
or
at
least
help
to
save
new
haven
very
substantially.
there
is
a
complete
lack
of
any
showing
and
i
think
the
burden
is
on
them
to
make
the
showing
in
specifics
not
in
statements
about
the
desperate
conditions
of
the
new
haven
and
how
everybody
wants
the
new
haven.
i'm
a
native
of
new
haven,
grew
up
in
new
haven,
and
lived
--
a
resident
now
of
connecticut.
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
try
to
box
something
that
is
required
by
the
new
haven.
but
i
have
yet
after
months
and
months,
and
months,
and
months
of
work
on
this
case
to
find
any
intelligible
statement
on
the
other
side
or
by
the
commission
as
to
why
--
what
we
are
trying
to
do
to
protect
the
erie-lackawanna
is
going
to
hurt
to
new
haven.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
erie-lackawanna
which
is
the
largest
and
usually
the
first
named
of
the
three
so-called
protected
railroads.
now
our
case
here,
and
our
case
below,
is
very,
very
narrow
as
been
the
case
that
was
put
to
you
by
mr.
trienens.
we
are
in
the
anomalous
position
here
in
that
the
norfolk
&
western
and
those
affiliated
with
it
have
a
very
broad
program
with
which
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
d
&
h
and
counsel
for
the
d
&
h
who
will
follow
on
me
do
not
agree.
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
while
mr.
trienens
said
higher
in
the
court
in
thinking
that
the
commission
should
not
have
been
sustained.
mr.
trienens
and
i
disagree
a
great
deal
about
many
of
the
things
that
he
had
said
to
you.
another
thing
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
we
have
--
we
stand
on
specific
findings.
we
stand
on
a
specific
course
that
was
followed.
we
stand
on
specific
statutes
as
made
--
seen
to
be
a
dry
approach
to
this
case.
but
erie-lackawanna
is
an
important
railway.
it
isn't
as
if
it
was
some
trolley
line
that
had
to
die
so
that
progress
should
go
ahead.
it
serves
the
country
from
the
port
of
new
york
to
chicago
on
its
own
lines
with
buffalo
and
immediate
cities.
it
serves
--
it
go
--
it
reaches
to
st.
louis
through
connections
and
then
of
course
its
traffic
to
interchange
all
over
the
country.
its
revenue
last
year
--
in
1965
were
approximately
$230
million
neither
is
the
d
&
h
who
were
following
the
--
a
railroad
that
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
unemployed.
i
will
say
no
more
about
their
importance
because
the
commission
unanimously
found
that
they
were
essential
unanimously
and
i
don't
see
why
since
nobody
challenges
those
findings.
i
should
take
the
time
of
this
court
to
say
that
they're
supported
by
the
record.
i
want
to
mention
two
other
points
of
explicit
disagreement
with
mr.
trienens.
but
first
of
all,
we
do
not
agree
that
the
provisions
for
and
indemnification
condition
was
an
illegal
pool
under
section
5
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
testimony
on
that
subject
at
the
adjourned
hearings
for
which
the
condition
provided
has
been
taken.
mr.
trienens
introduces
a
testimony
of
an
emily
gail,
professor
and
does
not
introduce
cross
examination
of
the
(inaudible).
briefs
haven't
yet
been
filed.
the
question
is
to
whether
that's
an
illegal
pool
hardly
seems
to
me
the
day
before
the
court
because
actually
at
the
present
time
there
is
no
indemnification
condition.
any
decision
by
this
court
on
that
subject
would
be
a
many
of
something
that
doesn't
yet
exist
in
the
light
of
inadequate
argument.
he
spoke
also
of
the
capital
indemnity
issue.
i
would
like
to
say
on
that
that
while
i
do
not
minimize
its
importance
it
is
not
been
mention
in
any
document
filed
by
erie-lackawanna
with
this
court.
our
appeal
has
been
based
squarely
and
exclusively
on
points
that
were
raised
below
and
our
emphasis
has
been
on
the
so-called
protective
conditions.
and
what
happen
to
them
and
i
will
tell
you
that
as
briefly
as
i
can.
i
want
to
assure
you
that
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
new
haven
but
in
the
way
i
have
lined
things
up
here
i
don't
come
to
it
right
off
of
the
bat
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
--
because
it
seems
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
on
findings
of
the
commission
and
on
statutes
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
now
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
our
position
on
that
is
this
mr.
justice
white.
that's
what
we
would
like
and
we
think
that
would
be
just
but
our
ancestors
in
our
pages
has
been
on
the
protective
conditions.
is
that
a
fair
answer?
i
don't
want
to
give
up
the
position
that
we
wouldn't
like
to
be
included?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
all
that
--
we
aren't
asking
for
it.
but
we
have
not
argued
that
any
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we
have
not
argued
that.
i
think
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
don't
like
--
i
think
i
don't
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
what?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
no,
i
don't
want
to
argue
it.
i
want
to
say
that
we
would
be
very
happy
with
that
and
we've
asked
for
it.
but
our
argument
is
based
upon
what
the
commission
did
with
respect
to
the
protective
conditions.
now,
those
are
--
you've
been
told
something
about
them,
two
of
the
lawyers
--
by
both
lawyers
mentioned
what
is
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
three.
and
that
is
the
one
on
page
--
the
bottom
at
page
18
of
our
brief
which
says,
"it
is
doubtful
there
without
inclusion
that
a
major
system,
these
three
carries
that
withstand
the
competition
of
the
applicants
converged
and
unless
they
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
there
future
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
of
merger
at
this
time
even
though
approving
the
merger".
then
the
commission
went
on
to
say,
“our
pool
other
than
merger
for
undelayed
consummation
shall
be
subject
therefore
to
the
conditions
specifically
described
in
appendix
g”.
now,
an
argument
is
made
by
one
of
the
counsels
for
one
of
the
appellees
that
all
the
commission
said
is,
“well,
they've
got
to
be
protected
in
some
way
or
other".
that
is
not
correct.
and
isn't
there
that
there
are
pool
was
subject
to
the
conditions
specifically
described
in
appendix
g
and
it
then
went
on
to
make
the
mandatory
statutory
findings
that
obvious
relations,
direct
relation
to
what
it
had
previously
found.
so
long
the
basis
of
the
appendices
had
found
the
conditions
to
be
just
and
reasonable
which
is
the
statutory
language.
now,
what
happened?
when
we
have
an
opportunity
to
study
what
they
had
done
and
mr.
trienens
is
completely
direct
in
saying
that
the
were
no
advance
nor
was
there
any
kind
whatsoever
that
this
type
of
thing
was
even
under
consideration
with
no
hearing,
no
opportunity
for
argument,
nothing
was
done
within
the
walls
of
the
building
where
the
commission
sit
as
its
offices
by
whoever
did
it.
we've
studied
them
and
we
felt
that
they
were
very
seriously
defective
both
in
substance
and
in
form.
on
july
8,
reason
to
believe
we
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration
in
which
after
untold
hours
of
work
we
tried
to
refrain
in
such
a
way
as
to
do
what
we
thought
should
be
done.
answers
were
due
at
least
to
two
of
those
petitions.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
petitions
on
the
first
of
august.
the
last
come
in
on
the
8th
of
august,
a
very
short
one.
commission
did
nothing.
they
just
--
the
papers
just
sat
there.
then
many
times
we
have
this
sort
of
damage
at
least
to
the
effective
date.
if
and
when
the
order
became
effective,
the
merger
could
go
right
--
quite
through
and
it
was
announced
to
the
papers
that
they
have
established
sixty
or
more
men
getting
already
to
put
it
to.
our
first
effort
to
get
--
or
one
of
our
efforts
to
get
an
extension
of
the
effective
date
was
successful
because
the
commission
said
that
it
immediate
--
have
time
to
consider
these
petitions.
it
said
nothing
about
allowing
us
time
for
judicial
review
which
was
what
we
asked
for.
by
the
8th
of
september
we
were
in
this
position.
our
petition
was
on
file,
nothing
had
happen.
we
have
the
september
30
effective
date.
we
had
to
figure
out
how
much
time
is
--
was
going
to
take
to
protect
our
rights
and
we
decided
we
couldn't
wait
anymore
and
we
filed
papers
and
that's
how
this
suit
started.
after
the
suit
has
started,
two
days
before
the
argument
in
the
three-judge
court,
two
days
before
the
argument
in
the
three-judge
court
out
came
the
commission's
further
order.
the
september
the
16th
actually
released
on
september
19th.
the
last
further
order
said
and
i
think
i
should
read
this
because
i
--
this
is
very,
very
important.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
sir?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
further
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
further
order,
further.
the
commission
said
that
the
petitioners
had
raised
valid
issues.
the
three
protected
carriers,
that's
the
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h
and
whom
you
hear
and
b
&
m
to
whom
we
won't
hear.
the
three
protected
carriers
on
petition
have
raised
valid
issues
as
to
the
interpretation,
application,
scope
and
other
aspects
of
the
protection.
so
the
commission
provided
that
there
should
be
further
hearings
and
they
said
that
until
the
traffic
conditions
which
were
extraordinarily
complex
extremely
important
and
in
our
view,
very
defective.
they
were
to
remain
operative
until
or
further
ordered.
the
other
condition,
the
indemnification
condition
which
was
the
mr.
trienens
has
mentioned
was
ascended
in
its
entirety.
and
the
commission
said,
“though
or
indicative
that
if
it
were
reinstated
or
if
any
were
reinstated
that
would
be
retroactive
to
the
days
of
consummation”.
and
then
the
commission
said,
“go
ahead
with
the
consummation”.
and
our
position
is
that
there
are
no
findings
in
that
september
16
report
which
can
conceivably
be
cited
as
justifying
what
the
commission
did.
even
if
it
--
he
had
assumed
that
the
fact
that
the
commission
did
what
it
thought
had,
what
it
had
to
do
implied
that
it
thought
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
it
gave
no
reasons
at
all
to
amount
anything
certainly
not
as
to
the
protected
conditions
except
to
say
that
all
these
issues
has
been
raised.
now,
i
think
that
the
--
that
our
case
--
by
our
case
i
am
talking
to
the
erie-lackawanna
case
and
the
d
&
h
case
was
magnificently
summarized
in
an
opinion
of
judge
weinfeld
who
dissented
below.
this
is
not
an
opinion.
in
this
case
this
is
an
opinion
in
a
following
case
which
i
think
is
now
before
this
court
brought
by
new
haven's
farm
holders.
he
concurred
there
with
it,
judge
brody
and
judge
levet.
but
he
distinguishes
between
that
case
and
this
case
in
these
words
and
these
sums
up
our
case
better
than
i
can
do
it.
in
the
erie
case,
the
commission
has
found
that
the
public
interest
required
protection
of
the
three
carriers
against
the
adverse
effect
of
a
merger
and
as
a
condition
of
consummation
imposed
specific
protective
terms
which
are
subsequently
revoked
ex
parte
in
my
view
without
adequate
supporting
findings
as
to
one
condition
and
lesser
future
determination
as
to
others.
the
terms
and
conditions
as
originally
delineated
by
the
commission
where
a
city
quite
known
of
the
merger.
now,
where
are
we
now?
we
have
the
appendix
g
traffic
condition.
i'm
assuming
for
example
that
this
court
reverses,
the
--
affirms
the
lower
court
and
the
merger
goes
through
on
february
1,
where
would
we
be?
we
would
have
these
appendix
g
traffic
conditions.
how
good
are
they?
we
say
they
are
no
good,
practically.
and
nobody
has
ever
answered
our
criticisms
that
its
statement
includes
the
commission.
it
includes
that
the
court
below.
it
includes
the
appellees.
they
don't
want
to
take
to
answer
them.
is
our
main
--
to
our
main
brief
rather
than
bore
the
court
with
a
great
long
discussion
of
this
topic,
this
subject.
we
dealt
with
it
very
deeply
in
the
bottom
of
--
body
of
the
brief,
pages
41
and
43.
and
then
in
appendix
d,
we
discussed
some
of
the
major
defects,
no
answer.
now,
mr.
silleck
has
dealt
with
this
subject
in
his
briefs
more
fully
than
i
have.
so,
i'm
not
going
to
go
on
with
that
on
with
that.
i
am
confident
as
to
what
you
--
that
you
get
the
whole
story
before
the
deal
is
over.
now,
as
to
the
--
as
the
indemnification
condition,
where
we
stand
on
that?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
the
indemnification
conditions.
judge
weinfeld
says,
"none
can
define
what
will
happen".
nobody
can
define
what
would
happen.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
it.
we
didn't
--
we
thing
we've
made
it
a
good
case
for
it
at
these
hearings
which
are
recently
been
held.
they
were
held
before,
an
examiner
who
had
no
authority.
he
didn't
undertake
to
express
any
opinion.
these
are
going
to
be
filed,
what
do
we
going
to
have?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
of
the
most
recent
hearings?
well,
i
was
really
expect
the
decision
--
i
think
that
the
first
decision
it
will
be
on
so-called
capital
indemnity
which
is
heard
first.
and
then
the
second
decision
would
be
on
items
1
and
2
and
i
would
be
really
surprised
if
that
was
not
down
by
let
say,
the
first
of
april.
the
second
--
the
reply
briefs
are
due
--
the
sixth
of
february
--
to
the
sixth
of
february.
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
wasn't
down
with
it
by
the
first
of
april.
you
realize
of
course
mr.
justice
harlan
that
mr.
trienens
and
his
(inaudible)
may
challenge
it,
indemnification
condition
even
if
we're
entirely
content
with
it.
there
may
be
a
connection
say
you
can
have
this
going.
now,
i
think
you
just
tolerate
to
ask
whether
the
question
of
power
was
raised.
the
answer
is
yes.
we
questioned
the
commission's
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case.
now,
the
--
appellees
say
that
we
are
arguing
that
every
detail
of
every
condition
in
every
by
to
transaction
has
to
be
put
down
the
last
of
defining
debt.
we
make
no
such
argument.
we
say
that
then
--
and
i
think
they
must
agree
that
the
limit
beyond
this
recognition
can't
go.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well,
i
would
think
so,
yes,
for
this
one.
i've
seen
two
lights.
i
think
that
means
i'm
done
with
the
(inaudible).
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
what
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
they
cite
authorities
with
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
am
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
reserving
10
minutes
to
reply,
i
have
four
minutes
now
and
i
will
try
to
cover
my
ground
in
four
minutes.
i
would
simply
like
to
refer
to
the
discussions
of
our
briefs
of
the
re
--
statements
by
the
commission
that
these
two
railroads
were
invulnerable
and
highly
sensitive
financial
condition
to
railroads,
it
made
a
$122
million
in
1965.
i
would
like
also
call
attention
to
the
point
that
deals
with
all
the
reasons
the
commission
gave
for
prompt
consummation.
and
finally
to
the
point
--
the
effect
of
the
court
below
really
base
its
decision
to
a
considerable
degree
on
suppositions
and
conjectures
that
had
absolutely
no
support
in
the
record.
now
as
to
the
new
haven,
i
cannot
tell
you
and
i
don't
think
it's
my
--
really
my
job
to
tell
you
all
about
new
haven.
i
will
come
to
that.
our
position
is
this,
they
requested
deferment
until
the
protected
conditions
are
determined
even
if
judicial
review
is
involved,
involves
no
threat
to
the
new
haven
as
you
could
measure,
no
treat
to
the
new
haven.
i
think
the
threat
to
the
new
haven
if
even
deferring
until
we
are
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western
would
be
very
slight.
the
reason
the
commission
did
what
it
did
was
because
it
would
not
find
out
what
the
facts
were.
and
in
our
petition
to
reconsideration
we
asked
them
to
find
out
more
about
new
haven.
all
they
were
told
was
that
new
haven
was
in
a
desperate
condition.
that
it
had
to
be
a
penn-central
merger
to
save
the
new
haven,
repeated
and
repeated,
repeated
with
no
explanation
of
the
connection
between
the
penn-central
merger
and
the
new
haven.
and
they
decided
that
was
right
and
refused
to
find
out.
now,
i
feel
that
since
the
new
haven
trustees
and
the
four
states
have
a
total
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
they
together
have
an
obligation
to
tell
this
court,
first,
what
is
really
required
to
bring
about
the
inclusion
of
new
haven?
mr.
justice
harlan
wondered
whether
they
were
only
procedural
points.
the
answer
isn't
they're
not
only
procedural
points.
they
are
very
substantive
points
involving
both
this
proceeding
and
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
reorganization
proceeding.
how
long
will
it
take
to
guesses
below
were
up
to
two
years.
well,
my
own
view
is
that's
optimistic.
and
finally
in
this
i
think
is
crucial,
why
and
how
and
to
what
extent
will
a
deferment
of
penn-central
merger
have
any
effect
on
the
solution
to
the
new
haven
problem.
now,
there's
no
answer
to
say
that
the
new
haven
is
in
desperate
condition.
it's
out
of
cash.
it
may
not
have
enough
cash
to
survive
and
so
forth.
unless
you
show
that
by
jeopardizing
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
delaware
and
hudson,
you're
going
to
save
the
new
haven
or
at
least
help
to
save
new
haven
very
substantially.
there
is
a
complete
lack
of
any
showing
and
i
think
the
burden
is
on
them
to
make
the
showing
in
specifics
not
in
statements
about
the
desperate
conditions
of
the
new
haven
and
how
everybody
wants
the
new
haven.
i'm
a
native
of
new
haven,
grew
up
in
new
haven,
and
lived
--
a
resident
now
of
connecticut.
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
try
to
box
something
that
is
required
by
the
new
haven.
but
i
have
yet
after
months
and
months,
and
months,
and
months
of
work
on
this
case
to
find
any
intelligible
statement
on
the
other
side
or
by
the
commission
as
to
why
--
what
we
are
trying
to
do
to
protect
the
erie-lackawanna
is
going
to
hurt
to
new
haven.
