justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
would
take
it
that
you
--
that
that
wasn't
--
that
that
approach
would
require
the
commission
to
find
a
home
for
these
three
carriers
prior
to
approving
the
merger
because
otherwise
you
would
never
know
what
kind
of
an
animal
you
were
dealing
with
from
--
on
your
own
premise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
really
think
the
penn-central
merger
must
be
held
off
until
the
commission
decides
with
what
system
these
three
are
going
to
adjoin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
just
isn't
a
question
of
these
protective
conditions.
in
your
mind
it's
a
much
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
more
extensive
delay
of
the
impact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
about
the
new
haven?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
supposed
to
go
under
the
commission's
plan,
was
supposed
to
do
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
that
depend
on
something
on
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anyway
its
not
(inaudible)
not
just
the
(inaudible),
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
on
your
argument
then
you
have
to
wait
until
we
know
what's
going
to
happen
in
new
haven?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
detail
--
distinguish
it
from
the
other
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
know
what
animal
the
penn-central
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
new
haven,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
the
result?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
only
under
temporary
indemnity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
perhaps
your
expertise
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
going
to
get
around
in
saying
what
should
be
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
others
in
--
i
will
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
really
goes
to
these
--
to
the
merger,
why
not?
now,
it
sounds
pretty
much
as
in
the
way
--
this
goes
to
whether
the
merger
ought
to
be
approved
on
any
terms.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
didn't
during
the
hearings
put
in
any
evidence
of
the
impact
of
the
merger
on
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
happened
that
turned
you
loose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
are
you
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
b
&
o
and
the
c
&
o,
they
could
have
done
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
do
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
you're
talking
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
now
or
you're
talking
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
locked
and
bribed
also
or
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
merger
being
pushed
upon
them
or
are
they
anxious
for
it
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
they're
a
merger
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
already
been
merged
but
i
mean
indicative
in
the
three
lines.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
cutler,
c
&
j
want
to
get
in
to
one
of
these?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
agree,
don't
you
mr.
bourne
that
--
mr.
bourne,
you
do
agree
that
the
--
that
if
the
merger
is
to
be
postponed
until
these
conditions
are
determined
that
it
is
also
must
await
judicial
review
of
the
condition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ginnane,
i
hope
you
don't
mind
if
i
--
this
last
question
we
were
discussing
with
the
solicitor
general.
is
it
impossible
to
get
the
norfolk
and
to
see
--
that's
the
inclusion
case
into
the
second
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
erie-lackawanna
did
it,
it
could
go
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
norfolk
and
western
is
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
were
judicial
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ginnane,
what
would
you
--
perhaps
you
don't
want
to
address
yourself
with
this.
what
if
the
commission
had
found
that
the
--
that
there
was
not
a
--
that
there
1960
to
1964
operations
were
unprofitable,
railroad
transportation
alike?
but
that
from
1964
on
the
prediction
was
that
both
railroads
would
have
probable
transportation
operation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
happened
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
give
any
suggestion
on
how
long
it
might
take
to
get
the
bankruptcy
aspects
of
the
new
haven
problem
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
getting
overall
the
bankruptcy
hurdles
and
everything
else?
justice
william
j.
