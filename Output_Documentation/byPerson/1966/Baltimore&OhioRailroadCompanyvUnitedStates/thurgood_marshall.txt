mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
is
that
the
united
states
is
concerned
in
this
case
primarily
with
the
question
of
sound
administrative
procedures
in
general.
and
the
possible
harm
caused
by
the
commission's
departure
from
such
procedure
that
all
of
these
might
be
pulled
a
smaller
yet
essential
railroads
in
the
east,
notably
the
three-railroad
everybody
has
been
talking
about.
the
question
in
our
mind
is
that
some
procedure
would
require
the
commission
to
withhold
the
immediate
consummation
of
this
particular
one
penn-central
merger
because
in
particular
effect,
that
accomplishes
an
irreversible
event
before
attempting
to
solve
the
great
problems
which
the
merger
would
create
for
the
smaller
railroads.
we
rely
very
heavily
on
judge
weinfeld's
dissenting
opinion.
starts
on
840
in
the
b
&
o's
brief.
and
he
points
out
one
thing
that
this
is
very
difficult
to
each
time
of
this
argument
to
find
something
that
hasn't
been
said.
but
judge
weinfeld
on
44
put
some
stress
on
the
fact.
then
in
the
commission's
quote,
“statutory
findings
and
ultimate
conclusions”,
it
points
out
these
needs
for
these
railroads.
and
when
you
read
that
in
conjunction
with
the
conclusion
they
made
that
this
would
not
work
unless
the
three
railroads
were
protected.
i
agree
that
this
was
a
condition
precedent
and
once
the
commission
adopted
that.
it
was
not
the
normal
procedure
to
go
back
and
take
out
the
particular
appendices.
after
commission
had
adopted
this
appendix
g,
which
they
called
protective
condition
for
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
in
boston
and
maine,
the
commission
itself
considered
this
necessary
and
made
it
quite
clear
that
without
them,
the
commission
stated
that
would
not
authorize
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger.
and
despite
what
appears
in
all
of
the
briefs
of
appellees
that
united
states
raised
the
point
that
they
never
raised
before,
united
states
government
did
raise
it
in
the
petition
for
reconsideration
before
the
commission
itself
that's
one
of
the
places
it
was
raised.
and
it
appears
on
page
17
of
the
exemption
filed
by
the
united
states
government.
if
the
commission
determines
to
approve
this
merger,
a
minimum
condition
of
such
approval
should
be
that
consummation
be
delayed
for
at
least
18
months
in
order
to
give
the
erie,
d
&
m,
and
d
&
h
time
to
apply
for
the
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
system
and
c
&
o
system
are
in
until
actual
inclusion
in
either
is
effectuated
if
the
latter
should
become
sooner.
i
take
the
position
that
the
appellees
take
which
is
at
the
united
states'
government
has
no
right
to
comment
on
a
merger
of
this
type
which
they
the
same
breadth
say,
it's
the
largest
merger
that
would
ever
occur
and
it
is
the
most
urgent
one
that
would
ever
occur.
i
think
the
united
states
government
still
has
the
right
as
a
party
to
present
its
side.
and
in
these
particular
exemptions
that
we
file,
we
pointed
to
the
commission
had
acquiesced
to
the
failure
of
those
two
rail
system
to
present
evidence
of
the
adverse
effect
of
the
penn-central
merger
on
them.
notwithstanding
that
on
the
separate
proceeding
these
very
railroads
would
rely
on
the
change
and
the
competitive
balance
in
the
northeast
represented
by
the
penn-central
merger
to
support
their
own
merger
application,
especially
if
the
smaller
roads
were
not
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
as
has
been
noted
however,
the
commission
decline
to
delay
consummation
of
penn-central
merger
without
giving
the
reason
and
the
district
court
declined
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
judicial
review.
the
majority
opinion
by
judge
friendly
seem
to
put
great
emphasis
on
what
could
be
done
in
the
future
and
also
emphasis
on
rightfully
so
on
the
new
haven
railroad
but
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
problems.
now,
the
district
court
by
refusing
to
enjoin
the
merger,
in
effect
ascended
to
the
commission's
procedure.
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
some
of
the
principal
issues
raised
will
be
mooted
and
that
goes
for
most
of
the
argument
this
morning
when
to
put
on
detail
as
to
each
one
of
these
three
railroads.
before
discussing
the
procedure
the
commission
itself,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
united
states
does
not
oppose
the
penn-central
merger
itself.
so
long
as
the
merger
can
be
effected
with
adequate
concern
for
and
protection
of
the
three
smaller
roads
that
were
most
keenly
feel
its
effects,
the
so-called
offense.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
get
three
large
groups.
we
would
have
no
objection
at
all
if
the
court
adopts
our
suggested
way
of
handling
this
matter
and
it
goes.
the
commission
continues
to
proceed
and
the
commission
itself
decides
to
let
central
of
new
jersey
in.
it's
perfectly
alright
but
i
don't
think
at
this
stage
that
this
court
should
order
the
commission
to
let
central
of
new
jersey
in.
i
don't
know
about
how
good
the
claim
of
latches
is
one
way
or
the
other.
there
is,
it
appears
from
a
reading
of
the
record
that
the
d
&
o
had
control
of
some
form
of
control
over
them
at
all.
but
that's
where
the
real
expertise
of
the
commission
comes
into.
but
i
don't
see
that
well
insofar
as
the
government
is
concerned,
we
have
three
orphans
and
if
anything
that
we
get
for
our
three
orphans.
if
some
other
orphan
can
use
it,
it
would
help
because
our
primary
interest
is
to
see
to
it
that
the
end
result
of
the
merging
of
the
railroads
in
the
east
is
in
the
best
public
interest.
i
hope
that's
best.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
my
--
because
the
new
jersey
railroad
didn't
come
in
on
time
when
it
had
a
chance
to
come
in.
the
proceedings
are
still
there
but
and
i
said,
when
it
goes
back
then
the
central
of
new
jersey
can't
put
in
its
renewed
position.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
pre
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
because
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not.
it
appears
that
they
are
but
if
that's
a
matter
that
has
--
if
the
--
it
develops
that
the
central
of
new
jersey
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
without
what
i
was
get
right
to
say
sir.
i
don't
think
they
should
be
bothered,
they
destroyed
or
if
it
is
in
the
public
interest
that
you
have
that
railroad
included
in
some
family.
that
can
be
decided
when
that
point
comes
up
but
as
of
the
penn-central
merger
when
this
was
moved,
these
other
two
mergers
that
going
off
and
that
emphasizes
the
real
problem
in
the
uniqueness
of
the
penn-central
merger
because
this
is
the
one
after
this
one.
nobody
knows
what's
going
to
happen
to
any
remaining
orphans.
that's
why
the
government
suggests
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
over
this
and
let
the
commission
work
of
all
these
out
to
see
where
these
orphans
are
going.
whether
you're
going
to
be
protected
and
indeed
how
there
going
to
be
protected?
and
i
wouldn't
exclude
anyone
from
that
--
from
the
right
to
go
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
convinced
that
adequate
protective
conditions
can
be
put
in.
but
if
it
is
shown
that
the
adequate
protective
conditions
are
what
they
say,
adequate
protection,
then
that
would
be
a
different
problem.
but
as
we
see
it
now,
there
is
no
adequate
protection
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
said,
we
have
any
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
it
and
i
would
say
any
other
railroad
which
comes
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
i'm
back
at
somebody
said
earlier
this
morning.
i
have
no
expertise
in
that
field.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
until
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
i
personally
can
see
no
reason
why
the
commission
couldn't
get
the
basic
details
done
within
the
end
of
this
year
and
far
before
the
end
of
this
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they've
got
move
--
it's
moving
along
now.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
may
very
well
be
judicial
review.
and
if
the
judicial
review
does
not
have
to
extend
over
an
extraordinary
period.
indeed
this
very
case
shows
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
--
well,
i
would
say
that
it
could
be
assumed
that
there
would
be
an
application
for
judicial
review
and
it
could
--
it
be
consumed
that
the
district
court
would
look
at
the
record
find
and
not
to
support
the
commission
and
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
--
yes,
sir.
that's
what
we
want.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
new
haven
will
--
the
new
haven
is
in
a
very
good
position
because
you
got
both
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
going
along
and
this
going
along
together.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
i
don't.
but
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
it
seems
to
be
that
the
new
haven
is
going
to
penn-central
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
with
penn
--
well,
i
understand
it
that
new
haven
is
only
one
its
pretty
safe
on
where
they're
going.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
no
it's
really
coming
up
because
i
was
up
there
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
i
went
up
on
the
train
to
new
haven
and
came
back
and
both
of
them
got
in
on
time.
alright,
as
an
old
experienced
new
haven
traveler,
i
think
things
are
looking
up.
you
see,
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
clark,
the
most
i
have
tied
down
is
that
the
government
supports
this
merger.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
but
it
is
my
understanding
these
are
not
certain
of
is
that
there
is
no
our
position
to
the
others.
you
see
our
original
position
of
the
government,
we
didn't
oppose
the
others
but
the
reason
was
that
they
didn't
affect
other
railroads.
they
didn't
impinge
on
anybody.
so,
so
far
as
i
know
our
position
is
that
we
are
not
opposing
them.
now,
i
have
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
--
that's
not
for
me
to
pass
on.
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don
t
know
sir.
i
missed
what
it
means,
do
you
know.
no,
he'd
say
he
doesn't
believe
it.
no,
i
actually
don't
know.
the
one
thing
--
the
only
thing
i
want
to
make
clear
and
i
think
that
is
rather
important.
we
realized
in
this
case
the
position
that
we
took
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
united
states
attorney
from
the
southern
district
filed
a
letter
which
each
of
the
judges
and
said
did
the
government
did
not
support
or
oppose
the
action
for
the
preliminary
injunction
and
i
do
know
the
position
that
the
government
takes
as
of
now.
and
i
do
say
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
we
realize
the
difficulty
in
a
court
holding
a
case
and
holding
jurisdiction
without
passing
on
the
merits
as
soon
as
possible.
and
the
idea
in
this
case
was
that
with
the
open
railroad
sitting
out
there
and
with
the
growing
uncertainty
as
to
what
appendix
--
the
remaining
part
of
appendix
b,
g
that
was
left
was
not
understood.
and
the
final
point
that
the
commission
was
proceeding
with
its
hearings
on
the
capital
--
the
investment
and
indeed
the
inclusion
that
it
would
be
wise
at
this
stage
of
this
case
which
should
come
up
so
rapidly
here
would
be
for
this
court
to
hold
it
with
the
indeed
fond
hope
that
the
commission
would
promptly
complete
the
hearings
including
norfolk
and
western,
including
b
&
o
if
you
please,
including
penn-central
and
that
eventually
a
concrete
report
would
come
down
taking
care
of
these
smaller
railroads,
taking
care
of
the
actual
conditions
as
they
come
up.
then
it
would
be
time
if
necessary,
it
could
be
returned
to
the
district
court
or
could
be
left
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
say
--
we
take
both
positions.
we
say
that
court
commission
like
our,
because
under
5
(2)
they
did
not
find
that
this
--
they
did
not
have
basis
for
concluding
that
this
was
in
the
best
of
the
public
interest.
and
secondly,
if
you
don't
take
that
position
then
we
urge
that
you
take
reason
and
the
valley
the
discretions
in
changing
the
--
or
the
conditioning
upon
appendix
g
and
the
second
hearing
when
they
destroyed
appendix
g
for
all
intents
and
purposes.
we
rely
on
both
but
i
think
a
very
good
argument
can
be
make
for
the
first
one
and
that's
the
one
we
think
would
be
the
most
important
in
determining
what
must
be
done
in
administrative
hearings.
it's
just
on
their
one
phrase,
the
public
interest.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
has.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
was
--
no,
sir.
i
was
told
by
the
different
agencies
and
government
that
the
whole
changing
in
the
economic
structure
etcetera
of
the
whole
business
was
analyzed,
reanalyzed
by
the
agencies
of
government
responsible
for
such
and
they
did
con
--
now
conclude
that
this
particular
merger
was
good,
was
essentially
and
should
be
carried
through.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
it
--
completely
opposed
that
position
that
it
should
be
scrapped.
we
don't
think
the
merger
should
be
scrapped
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
are
for
the
merger.
this
particular
merger,
the
penn-central
merger
on
the
conditions
as
i
said
that
the
little
railroads
be,
you
know,
protected.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
so
long
as
its
us
--
so
long
as
the
orphans
finds
a
home.
we
want
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
monopolistic
part
would
come
in
if
boston
and
maine
then
i
as
a
non-expert
on
--
in
the
field
would
say
i
would
have
some
problems
with
that.
but
i
would
assume
the
commission
would
handle
that
problem
as
such.
but
i
think
the
concrete
answer
is
i
know
of
no
position
we
have
taking
at
this
time
at
the
hearings
and
the
--
i
just
don't
know
because
i'm
not
advised
of
the
hearings
on
the
commission
level
until
afterwards.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
leave
with
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
not
wrap
--
not
wrap
them
up.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
want
the
pairings
c
&
o,
norfolk
and
western
and
penn-central
to
end
up
on
deciding
what's
going
to
be
done
about
this
unaccounted
for
errors.
now,
whether
they
end
up
in
norfolk
and
western,
to
c
&
o
or
penn-central,
that's
not
our
job.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
hold
it
and
let
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
--
that's
--
that
was
the
first
to
--
the
real
problem
is
that
if
there's
a
proceeding
about
norfolk
and
western
and
i
don't
know
about
b
&
o
and
they
want
to
get
judicial
review.
they
couldn't
get
it
up
there.
they
have
to
go
to
the
office
where
they
are.
that's
one
problem
that
we
sought.
we
were
not
too
close
to.
i
don't
know.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
will
still
be
there
if
the
commission
finds
that
it
is
unable
to
determine
this
in
a
satisfactory
fashion.
you
still
--
the
district
court
would
be
there.
that
was
our
whole
purpose.
the
primary
one
was
we
don't
know
which
court
this
will
end
up
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
i
didn't
able
to
track.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
the
railroad
lawyer
say
that
if
you
have
an
objection
to
exceptions
or
what
have
you
--
you
filed
before
the
commission
and
then
i
understand
the
losing
party
has
to
go
but
where
they
have
their
office.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
the
pennsylvania
central,
the
central
i
think
should
be
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they're
you
have
--
they're
in
the
briefs.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
who
is
in
new
york
central?
your
--
it's
the
erie-lackawanna,
the
original
one
is
erie-lackawanna,
that's
their
office.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they've
intervened.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
--
i'm
reminded
that
the
inclusion
case
is
not
here.
the
one
that
was
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
norfolk
and
western
which
norfolk
and
western
is
now
handling,
right
now.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
commission.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
commission
where
else
--
where
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
inclusion
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
one
who
have
to
go
whether
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it's
virginia
where
i
have
to
go.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
couldn't.
it
might
be
but
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
way.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
railroad
lawyers
on
one
side
of
the
case
maybe
that's
my
problem
but
--
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
whole
--
the
whole
risk
before
it
was
that
if
this
court
will
hold
the
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
properly
acts,
then
what
you
send
back
to
the
district
court
is
it
will
be
practically
done.
the
commission
will
have
completed
the
job
that
everybody
is
pretty
well
satisfied
with.
that
was
our
hope.
we
didn't
think
that
the
commission
should
be
reversed
as
such.
we
didn't
think
that
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
i
mean
remand
maybe
but
i
don't
know
as
i
see
it
now.
you
see
a
lot
that's
been
argued
now
about
commissioner
webb
and
all
of
these
hearings
that
were
held.
the
district
court
didn't
know
about
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
it's
after
you
suffer
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
that
but
what
would
we
do
with
the
inclusion
point,
the
one
that
commissioner
webb
just
passed
upon
it.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
get
that
in
there,
i
don't
know.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
is
that
the
united
states
is
concerned
in
this
case
primarily
with
the
question
of
sound
administrative
procedures
in
general.
and
the
possible
harm
caused
by
the
commission's
departure
from
such
procedure
that
all
of
these
might
be
pulled
a
smaller
yet
essential
railroads
in
the
east,
notably
the
three-railroad
everybody
has
been
talking
about.
the
question
in
our
mind
is
that
some
procedure
would
require
the
commission
to
withhold
the
immediate
consummation
of
this
particular
one
penn-central
merger
because
in
particular
effect,
that
accomplishes
an
irreversible
event
before
attempting
to
solve
the
great
problems
which
the
merger
would
create
for
the
smaller
railroads.
we
rely
very
heavily
on
judge
weinfeld's
dissenting
opinion.
starts
on
840
in
the
b
&
o's
brief.
and
he
points
out
one
thing
that
this
is
very
difficult
to
each
time
of
this
argument
to
find
something
that
hasn't
been
said.
but
judge
weinfeld
on
44
put
some
stress
on
the
fact.
then
in
the
commission's
quote,
“statutory
findings
and
ultimate
conclusions”,
it
points
out
these
needs
for
these
railroads.
and
when
you
read
that
in
conjunction
with
the
conclusion
they
made
that
this
would
not
work
unless
the
three
railroads
were
protected.
i
agree
that
this
was
a
condition
precedent
and
once
the
commission
adopted
that.
it
was
not
the
normal
procedure
to
go
back
and
take
out
the
particular
appendices.
after
commission
had
adopted
this
appendix
g,
which
they
called
protective
condition
for
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
in
boston
and
maine,
the
commission
itself
considered
this
necessary
and
made
it
quite
clear
that
without
them,
the
commission
stated
that
would
not
authorize
immediate
consummation
of
the
merger.
and
despite
what
appears
in
all
of
the
briefs
of
appellees
that
united
states
raised
the
point
that
they
never
raised
before,
united
states
government
did
raise
it
in
the
petition
for
reconsideration
before
the
commission
itself
that's
one
of
the
places
it
was
raised.
and
it
appears
on
page
17
of
the
exemption
filed
by
the
united
states
government.
if
the
commission
determines
to
approve
this
merger,
a
minimum
condition
of
such
approval
should
be
that
consummation
be
delayed
for
at
least
18
months
in
order
to
give
the
erie,
d
&
m,
and
d
&
h
time
to
apply
for
the
inclusion
in
the
n
&
w
system
and
c
&
o
system
are
in
until
actual
inclusion
in
either
is
effectuated
if
the
latter
should
become
sooner.
i
take
the
position
that
the
appellees
take
which
is
at
the
united
states'
government
has
no
right
to
comment
on
a
merger
of
this
type
which
they
the
same
breadth
say,
it's
the
largest
merger
that
would
ever
occur
and
it
is
the
most
urgent
one
that
would
ever
occur.
i
think
the
united
states
government
still
has
the
right
as
a
party
to
present
its
side.
and
in
these
particular
exemptions
that
we
file,
we
pointed
to
the
commission
had
acquiesced
to
the
failure
of
those
two
rail
system
to
present
evidence
of
the
adverse
effect
of
the
penn-central
merger
on
them.
notwithstanding
that
on
the
separate
proceeding
these
very
railroads
would
rely
on
the
change
and
the
competitive
balance
in
the
northeast
represented
by
the
penn-central
merger
to
support
their
own
merger
application,
especially
if
the
smaller
roads
were
not
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
as
has
been
noted
however,
the
commission
decline
to
delay
consummation
of
penn-central
merger
without
giving
the
reason
and
the
district
court
declined
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
judicial
review.
the
majority
opinion
by
judge
friendly
seem
to
put
great
emphasis
on
what
could
be
done
in
the
future
and
also
emphasis
on
rightfully
so
on
the
new
haven
railroad
but
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
problems.
now,
the
district
court
by
refusing
to
enjoin
the
merger,
in
effect
ascended
to
the
commission's
procedure.
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
some
of
the
principal
issues
raised
will
be
mooted
and
that
goes
for
most
of
the
argument
this
morning
when
to
put
on
detail
as
to
each
one
of
these
three
railroads.
before
discussing
the
procedure
the
commission
itself,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
united
states
does
not
oppose
the
penn-central
merger
itself.
so
long
as
the
merger
can
be
effected
with
adequate
concern
for
and
protection
of
the
three
smaller
roads
that
were
most
keenly
feel
its
effects,
the
so-called
offense.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
get
three
large
groups.
we
would
have
no
objection
at
all
if
the
court
adopts
our
suggested
way
of
handling
this
matter
and
it
goes.
the
commission
continues
to
proceed
and
the
commission
itself
decides
to
let
central
of
new
jersey
in.
it's
perfectly
alright
but
i
don't
think
at
this
stage
that
this
court
should
order
the
commission
to
let
central
of
new
jersey
in.
i
don't
know
about
how
good
the
claim
of
latches
is
one
way
or
the
other.
there
is,
it
appears
from
a
reading
of
the
record
that
the
d
&
o
had
control
of
some
form
of
control
over
them
at
all.
but
that's
where
the
real
expertise
of
the
commission
comes
into.
but
i
don't
see
that
well
insofar
as
the
government
is
concerned,
we
have
three
orphans
and
if
anything
that
we
get
for
our
three
orphans.
if
some
other
orphan
can
use
it,
it
would
help
because
our
primary
interest
is
to
see
to
it
that
the
end
result
of
the
merging
of
the
railroads
in
the
east
is
in
the
best
public
interest.
i
hope
that's
best.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
my
--
because
the
new
jersey
railroad
didn't
come
in
on
time
when
it
had
a
chance
to
come
in.
the
proceedings
are
still
there
but
and
i
said,
when
it
goes
back
then
the
central
of
new
jersey
can't
put
in
its
renewed
position.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
pre
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
because
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not.
it
appears
that
they
are
but
if
that's
a
matter
that
has
--
if
the
--
it
develops
that
the
central
of
new
jersey
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
without
what
i
was
get
right
to
say
sir.
i
don't
think
they
should
be
bothered,
they
destroyed
or
if
it
is
in
the
public
interest
that
you
have
that
railroad
included
in
some
family.
that
can
be
decided
when
that
point
comes
up
but
as
of
the
penn-central
merger
when
this
was
moved,
these
other
two
mergers
that
going
off
and
that
emphasizes
the
real
problem
in
the
uniqueness
of
the
penn-central
merger
because
this
is
the
one
after
this
one.
nobody
knows
what's
going
to
happen
to
any
remaining
orphans.
that's
why
the
government
suggests
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
over
this
and
let
the
commission
work
of
all
these
out
to
see
where
these
orphans
are
going.
whether
you're
going
to
be
protected
and
indeed
how
there
going
to
be
protected?
and
i
wouldn't
exclude
anyone
from
that
--
from
the
right
to
go
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
convinced
that
adequate
protective
conditions
can
be
put
in.
but
if
it
is
shown
that
the
adequate
protective
conditions
are
what
they
say,
adequate
protection,
then
that
would
be
a
different
problem.
but
as
we
see
it
now,
there
is
no
adequate
protection
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
said,
we
have
any
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
it
and
i
would
say
any
other
railroad
which
comes
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
i'm
back
at
somebody
said
earlier
this
morning.
i
have
no
expertise
in
that
field.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
until
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
i
personally
can
see
no
reason
why
the
commission
couldn't
get
the
basic
details
done
within
the
end
of
this
year
and
far
before
the
end
of
this
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they've
got
move
--
it's
moving
along
now.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
may
very
well
be
judicial
review.
and
if
the
judicial
review
does
not
have
to
extend
over
an
extraordinary
period.
indeed
this
very
case
shows
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
--
well,
i
would
say
that
it
could
be
assumed
that
there
would
be
an
application
for
judicial
review
and
it
could
--
it
be
consumed
that
the
district
court
would
look
at
the
record
find
and
not
to
support
the
commission
and
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
--
yes,
sir.
that's
what
we
want.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
new
haven
will
--
the
new
haven
is
in
a
very
good
position
because
you
got
both
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
going
along
and
this
going
along
together.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
i
don't.
but
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
it
seems
to
be
that
the
new
haven
is
going
to
penn-central
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
with
penn
--
well,
i
understand
it
that
new
haven
is
only
one
its
pretty
safe
on
where
they're
going.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
no
it's
really
coming
up
because
i
was
up
there
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
i
went
up
on
the
train
to
new
haven
and
came
back
and
both
of
them
got
in
on
time.
alright,
as
an
old
experienced
new
haven
traveler,
i
think
things
are
looking
up.
you
see,
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
clark,
the
most
i
have
tied
down
is
that
the
government
supports
this
merger.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
but
it
is
my
understanding
these
are
not
certain
of
is
that
there
is
no
our
position
to
the
others.
you
see
our
original
position
of
the
government,
we
didn't
oppose
the
others
but
the
reason
was
that
they
didn't
affect
other
railroads.
they
didn't
impinge
on
anybody.
so,
so
far
as
i
know
our
position
is
that
we
are
not
opposing
them.
now,
i
have
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
--
that's
not
for
me
to
pass
on.
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don
t
know
sir.
i
missed
what
it
means,
do
you
know.
no,
he'd
say
he
doesn't
believe
it.
no,
i
actually
don't
know.
the
one
thing
--
the
only
thing
i
want
to
make
clear
and
i
think
that
is
rather
important.
we
realized
in
this
case
the
position
that
we
took
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
united
states
attorney
from
the
southern
district
filed
a
letter
which
each
of
the
judges
and
said
did
the
government
did
not
support
or
oppose
the
action
for
the
preliminary
injunction
and
i
do
know
the
position
that
the
government
takes
as
of
now.
and
i
do
say
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
we
realize
the
difficulty
in
a
court
holding
a
case
and
holding
jurisdiction
without
passing
on
the
merits
as
soon
as
possible.
and
the
idea
in
this
case
was
that
with
the
open
railroad
sitting
out
there
and
with
the
growing
uncertainty
as
to
what
appendix
--
the
remaining
part
of
appendix
b,
g
that
was
left
was
not
understood.
and
the
final
point
that
the
commission
was
proceeding
with
its
hearings
on
the
capital
--
the
investment
and
indeed
the
inclusion
that
it
would
be
wise
at
this
stage
of
this
case
which
should
come
up
so
rapidly
here
would
be
for
this
court
to
hold
it
with
the
indeed
fond
hope
that
the
commission
would
promptly
complete
the
hearings
including
norfolk
and
western,
including
b
&
o
if
you
please,
including
penn-central
and
that
eventually
a
concrete
report
would
come
down
taking
care
of
these
smaller
railroads,
taking
care
of
the
actual
conditions
as
they
come
up.
then
it
would
be
time
if
necessary,
it
could
be
returned
to
the
district
court
or
could
be
left
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
say
--
we
take
both
positions.
we
say
that
court
commission
like
our,
because
under
5
(2)
they
did
not
find
that
this
--
they
did
not
have
basis
for
concluding
that
this
was
in
the
best
of
the
public
interest.
and
secondly,
if
you
don't
take
that
position
then
we
urge
that
you
take
reason
and
the
valley
the
discretions
in
changing
the
--
or
the
conditioning
upon
appendix
g
and
the
second
hearing
when
they
destroyed
appendix
g
for
all
intents
and
purposes.
we
rely
on
both
but
i
think
a
very
good
argument
can
be
make
for
the
first
one
and
that's
the
one
we
think
would
be
the
most
important
in
determining
what
must
be
done
in
administrative
hearings.
it's
just
on
their
one
phrase,
the
public
interest.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
has.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
was
--
no,
sir.
i
was
told
by
the
different
agencies
and
government
that
the
whole
changing
in
the
economic
structure
etcetera
of
the
whole
business
was
analyzed,
reanalyzed
by
the
agencies
of
government
responsible
for
such
and
they
did
con
--
now
conclude
that
this
particular
merger
was
good,
was
essentially
and
should
be
carried
through.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
it
--
completely
opposed
that
position
that
it
should
be
scrapped.
we
don't
think
the
merger
should
be
scrapped
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
are
for
the
merger.
this
particular
merger,
the
penn-central
merger
on
the
conditions
as
i
said
that
the
little
railroads
be,
you
know,
protected.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
so
long
as
its
us
--
so
long
as
the
orphans
finds
a
home.
we
want
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
monopolistic
part
would
come
in
if
boston
and
maine
then
i
as
a
non-expert
on
--
in
the
field
would
say
i
would
have
some
problems
with
that.
but
i
would
assume
the
commission
would
handle
that
problem
as
such.
but
i
think
the
concrete
answer
is
i
know
of
no
position
we
have
taking
at
this
time
at
the
hearings
and
the
--
i
just
don't
know
because
i'm
not
advised
of
the
hearings
on
the
commission
level
until
afterwards.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
leave
with
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
not
wrap
--
not
wrap
them
up.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
want
the
pairings
c
&
o,
norfolk
and
western
and
penn-central
to
end
up
on
deciding
what's
going
to
be
done
about
this
unaccounted
for
errors.
now,
whether
they
end
up
in
norfolk
and
western,
to
c
&
o
or
penn-central,
that's
not
our
job.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
hold
it
and
let
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
--
that's
--
that
was
the
first
to
--
the
real
problem
is
that
if
there's
a
proceeding
about
norfolk
and
western
and
i
don't
know
about
b
&
o
and
they
want
to
get
judicial
review.
they
couldn't
get
it
up
there.
they
have
to
go
to
the
office
where
they
are.
that's
one
problem
that
we
sought.
we
were
not
too
close
to.
i
don't
know.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
will
still
be
there
if
the
commission
finds
that
it
is
unable
to
determine
this
in
a
satisfactory
fashion.
you
still
--
the
district
court
would
be
there.
that
was
our
whole
purpose.
the
primary
one
was
we
don't
know
which
court
this
will
end
up
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
i
didn't
able
to
track.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
the
railroad
lawyer
say
that
if
you
have
an
objection
to
exceptions
or
what
have
you
--
you
filed
before
the
commission
and
then
i
understand
the
losing
party
has
to
go
but
where
they
have
their
office.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
the
pennsylvania
central,
the
central
i
think
should
be
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they're
you
have
--
they're
in
the
briefs.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
who
is
in
new
york
central?
your
--
it's
the
erie-lackawanna,
the
original
one
is
erie-lackawanna,
that's
their
office.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they've
intervened.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
--
i'm
reminded
that
the
inclusion
case
is
not
here.
the
one
that
was
ordered
to
be
taken
up
by
norfolk
and
western
which
norfolk
and
western
is
now
handling,
right
now.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
commission.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
commission
where
else
--
where
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
inclusion
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
one
who
have
to
go
whether
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it's
virginia
where
i
have
to
go.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
couldn't.
it
might
be
but
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
way.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
railroad
lawyers
on
one
side
of
the
case
maybe
that's
my
problem
but
--
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
whole
--
the
whole
risk
before
it
was
that
if
this
court
will
hold
the
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
properly
acts,
then
what
you
send
back
to
the
district
court
is
it
will
be
practically
done.
the
commission
will
have
completed
the
job
that
everybody
is
pretty
well
satisfied
with.
that
was
our
hope.
we
didn't
think
that
the
commission
should
be
reversed
as
such.
we
didn't
think
that
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
i
mean
remand
maybe
but
i
don't
know
as
i
see
it
now.
you
see
a
lot
that's
been
argued
now
about
commissioner
webb
and
all
of
these
hearings
that
were
held.
the
district
court
didn't
know
about
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
it's
after
you
suffer
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
that
but
what
would
we
do
with
the
inclusion
point,
the
one
that
commissioner
webb
just
passed
upon
it.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
get
that
in
there,
i
don't
know.
thank
you,
sir.
