justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
the
--
was
that
net
operating
income
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
the
--
but
how
about
operate
--
the
commissioner
addressed
itself
from
that
operating
income,
didn't
it
whether
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
was
total
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
operating
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
rather
significant
figure
if
you're
going
to
use
figures?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
know
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
all
the
commission
has
to
do
is
to
just
divide
them
--
to
make
some
decision
that
well,
if
we
can
work
it
out,
new
haven
is
going
to
be
with
the
penn-central,
i
would
think
by
the
same
token
it
would
be
enough
for
the
commission
to
say
these
three
roads
need
protection.
we'll
work
out
the
detail.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
commissioner,
what's
his
name,
webb?
justice
byron
r.
white
commissioner
webb
is
--
correct
about
the
conditions
of
boston
and
maine,
somebody
has
been
after
penn-central,
what
to
do
with
the
boston
and
maine
whether
the
penn-central
merger
take
place
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
this
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
let's
assume
that
penn-central
merger
doesn't
occur,
boston
and
maine
still
in
top
shape.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
still
is
a
viable
carrier
apparently
before
commissioner
webb
or
at
least
it
doesn't
worth
anything
to
n
&
w
or
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let's
assume
that
penn-central
doesn't
take
--
doesn't
work,
he
doesn't
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
not
talking
about
penn-central,
we're
talking
about
the
pennsylvania
or
the
new
york
central,
what
about
the
boston
and
maine?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
said
if
commissioner
webb
was
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
and
that's
an
assumption
nobody
would
say
that
it's
improper
to
put
it
in
within
n
&
w.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
a
live
viable
carrier
with
some
earnings,
why
would
you
--
why
would
anyone
say
it
isn't
improper
to
include
it
with
the
norfolk
and
western?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
very
strong
point
though
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
either
way
you've
got
it,
you've
got
the
problem
on
the
boston
and
maine
at
some
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
the
n
&
w
and
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
that
merger
proceeding.
that
--
is
that
actively
being
pursued
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
your
clients
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
by
the
b
&
o
and
c
&
o?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
nucleus,
what
else
would
you
inquire?
justice
byron
r.
white
though
there
--
there
was
no
attention
given
to
c
&
j
by
the
commission
except
they
made
no
findings
with
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
could
i
ask
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
before
you
were
urge
--
do
you
agree
with
mr.
trienens
that
this
proceeding
to
approve
that
the
merger
must
await
--
find
--
as
he
put
it,
finding
a
home
for
the
p
&
l?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
that
isn't
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
trienens
said
that
it
was
--
that
the
commission
must
find
a
home
for
the
e
&
l
before
the
merger
to
be
consummated.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
any
either
one
of
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you
(voice
overlap)
argue
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
want
to
argue
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
could
i
ask
you
--
as
i
understand
at
united
states
opposed
this
merger
before
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
very,
very
stoutly
and
that
at
that
time
as
the
united
states
has
changed
its
position
in
that
respect.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
railroads
are
in
much
better
position
than
they
were
when
you
were
opposing
the
merger.
is
there
some
phases
of
that
public
interest
which
you
haven't
thought
of
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
the
united
states
did
not
agree
with
the
city
of
scranton
or
mr.
shapp?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
i
take
it
from
your
brief
and
what
you
said,
you'd
also
support
the
merger
even
if
--
even
if
the
commission
decided
that
these
three
orphans
should
go
into
the
penn-central?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
care
about
the
monopolistic
situation
on
the
new
england
where
you
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
others
could
then
intervene
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
mean
to
say,
that
if
they
--
if
they
have
accepted
the
those
propositions
have
continued
prosperity
of
the
--
they
would
have
changed
their
minds
on
the
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
are
you
suggesting
that
it
would
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
they
wouldn't
accept
the
predictions
of
the
continued
prosperity?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
these
the
only
ways
it'd
be
--
it
is
suggested
that
the
merger
would
have
an
impact
to
central
new
jersey?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
--
send
them
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
had
they
--
have
they
had
a
chance
to
be
in
on
these
cases
--
hearings
of
interim
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understood
that
they
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
be
in
--
to
present
evidence
on
these
interim
protective
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
i
for
example
thinking
about
this
case
decided,
well,
i
was
interested
in
postponing
indefinitely
but
included
in
this
attitude
of
railroads
is
that
it
would
be
postponed
at
least
until
the
commission
concludes
the
protective
proceedings
and
settles
its
mind
on
what
the
condition
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
if
you
--
is
that
all
you're
going
to
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
approach
in
that
case?
is
it
the
sale
of
the
new
haven
just
by
an
order
of
the
court
or
is
it
a
plan
of
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
plan
applied
to
the
proceeds?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
time
that's
really
in
judicial
review
of
that
order
if
it
were
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
could
go
on
for
quite
a
while?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
no
court
ever
agreed
with
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
happened
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
applied
to
every
case
would
mean
that
the
commission
could
never
conclude
a
approved
--
approve
a
merger
until
it
decide
that
that
will
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
approval
of
the
merger
by
the
court
inevitably
and
finally
and
if
it's
consummated,
the
long
run
means
that
the
court
is
approving
the
disappearance
of
the
three
railroad
as
independent
railroad,
that
much
is
quite
clear?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
insist
on
staying
out
of
any
system,
they're
going
to
--
if
the
icc
is
right,
they're
going
to
die?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can't,
can
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
issue
is
certainly
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
the
same
argument
which
would
counsel
for
delay
until
the
protective
provisions
are
settled
--
would've
counsel
for
the
longer
delay
until
in
the
inclusion
proceeding
is
settled
and
if
you
do
one,
you
would
have
to
do
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
likelihood
is
slight
as
you
put
it
that
these
carriers
are
going
to
be
injured
by
consummation
now
and
getting
their
final
word
on
conditions
later.
that
might
be
so
slight
if
you
put
it,
i
would
think
the
likely
--
that
there
have
far
greater
hazard
on
--
at
the
inclusion
proceeding
of
getting
really
hurt
badly?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
the
commissioners
has
already
found
that
it
shouldn't
--
that
they
--
n&w
should
not
take
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hazard
in
boston
and
maine
is
at
least
far
greater
in
terms
of
--
ultimately
in
the
inclusion
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
haven't
done
very
much
of
anything
on
this
case,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
record
wasn't
even
there,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
with
that
responsibility
was
--
it
wasn't
before
the
court
will
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand,
i
understand.
the
only
trouble
is
that
sometimes
it
doesn't
work
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometimes
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said
that
the
--
when
the
issues
there
on
the
merits
of
the
merger,
there
may
be
other
arguments
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
--
there's
the
merger
and
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
the
--
was
that
net
operating
income
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
the
--
but
how
about
operate
--
the
commissioner
addressed
itself
from
that
operating
income,
didn't
it
whether
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
was
total
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
operating
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
rather
significant
figure
if
you're
going
to
use
figures?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
know
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
all
the
commission
has
to
do
is
to
just
divide
them
--
to
make
some
decision
that
well,
if
we
can
work
it
out,
new
haven
is
going
to
be
with
the
penn-central,
i
would
think
by
the
same
token
it
would
be
enough
for
the
commission
to
say
these
three
roads
need
protection.
we'll
work
out
the
detail.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
commissioner,
what's
his
name,
webb?
justice
byron
r.
white
commissioner
webb
is
--
correct
about
the
conditions
of
boston
and
maine,
somebody
has
been
after
penn-central,
what
to
do
with
the
boston
and
maine
whether
the
penn-central
merger
take
place
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
this
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
let's
assume
that
penn-central
merger
doesn't
occur,
boston
and
maine
still
in
top
shape.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
still
is
a
viable
carrier
apparently
before
commissioner
webb
or
at
least
it
doesn't
worth
anything
to
n
&
w
or
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let's
assume
that
penn-central
doesn't
take
--
doesn't
work,
he
doesn't
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
not
talking
about
penn-central,
we're
talking
about
the
pennsylvania
or
the
new
york
central,
what
about
the
boston
and
maine?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
said
if
commissioner
webb
was
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
and
that's
an
assumption
nobody
would
say
that
it's
improper
to
put
it
in
within
n
&
w.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
a
live
viable
carrier
with
some
earnings,
why
would
you
--
why
would
anyone
say
it
isn't
improper
to
include
it
with
the
norfolk
and
western?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
very
strong
point
though
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
either
way
you've
got
it,
you've
got
the
problem
on
the
boston

at

justice

how
about

to
central
new
jersey?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
--
send
them
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
had
they
--
have
they
had
a
chance
to
be
in
on
these
cases
--
hearings
of
interim
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understood
that
they
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
be
in
--
to
present
evidence
on
these
interim
protective
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
i
for
example
thinking
about
this
case
decided,
well,
i
was
interested
in
postponing
indefinitely
but
included
in
this
attitude
of
railroads
is
that
it
would
be
postponed
at
least
until
the
commission
concludes
the
protective
proceedings
and
settles
its
mind
on
what
the
condition
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
if
you
--
is
that
all
you're
going
to
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
approach
in
that
case?
is
it
the
sale
of
the
new
haven
just
by
an
order
of
the
court
or
is
it
a
plan
of
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
plan
applied
to
the
proceeds?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
time
that's
really
in
judicial
review
of
that
order
if
it
were
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
could
go
on
for
quite
a
while?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
no
court
ever
agreed
with
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
happened
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
applied
to
every
case
would
mean
that
the
commission
could
never
conclude
a
approved
--
approve
a
merger
until
it
decide
that
that
will
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
approval
of
the
merger
by
the
court
inevitably
and
finally
and
if
it's
consummated,
the
long
run
means
that
the
court
is
approving
the
disappearance
of
the
three
railroad
as
independent
railroad,
that
much
is
quite
clear?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
insist
on
staying
out
of
any
system,
they're
going
to
--
if
the
icc
is
right,
they're
going
to
die?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can't,
can
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
issue
is
certainly
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
the
same
argument
which
would
counsel
for
delay
until
the
protective
provisions
are
settled
--
would've
counsel
for
the
longer
delay
until
in
the
inclusion
proceeding
is
settled
and
if
you
do
one,
you
would
have
to
do
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
likelihood
is
slight
as
you
put
it
that
these
carriers
are
going
to
be
injured
by
consummation
now
and
getting
their
final
word
on
conditions
later.
that
might
be
so
slight
if
you
put
it,
i
would
think
the
likely
--
that
there
have
far
greater
hazard
on
--
at
the
inclusion
proceeding
of
getting
really
hurt
badly?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
the
commissioners
has
already
found
that
it
shouldn't
--
that
they
--
n&w
should
not
take
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hazard
in
boston
and
maine
is
at
least
far
greater
in
terms
of
--
ultimately
in
the
inclusion
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
haven't
done
very
much
of
anything
on
this
case,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
record
wasn't
even
there,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
with
that
responsibility
was
--
it
wasn't
before
the
court
will
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand,
i
understand.
the
only
trouble
is
that
sometimes
it
doesn't
work
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometimes
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said
that
the
--
when
the
issues
there
on
the
merits
of
the
merger,
there
may
be
other
arguments
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
--
there's
the
merger
and
not
--
