up

now,
which

justice

stewart
certainly
a

in
this

isn't
it?
justice

now
where
is
the
solicitor
general's?
justice

the

where
is
it
--
the

where
did
you
say
mr.

justice

stewart
--
how
about
the

of
the

of
your
client
in
this
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand,
he
is
not
a
--
he's
a
stockholder
and
a
businessman,
and
a
citizen
of
pennsylvania
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
shipper,
not
a

justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
feel
about
the
new
entry
in
the
orphanage
this
morning,
the
central
railroad
of
new
jersey?
justice

stewart
what

with
the
lehigh
railroad?
justice
potter
stewart
with
pennsylvania.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
next
stage
in
that
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
any
time
table
is
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
true,
isn't
it
that
--
however
that
in
its
first
report,
it
was
equally
clear
in
saying
that
the
merger
should
not
be
consummated
until
these
protective
conditions
were
fully
effectuated
and
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
clear
finding
that
without
such
conditions—
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
be
an
impairment
of
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
one
--
the
b&o-c&o
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
he
doing
is
going
to
hurt
us?
justice
potter
stewart
now
where
is
the
cnnj
at
this
point?
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
it's
the
cronj.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
the
status
of
new
haven
at
that
point?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
final
argument
or
preliminary
argument,
ultimate
argument
that
i
--
unless
i'm
mistaken,
you
haven't
got
yourself
to
how
do
the
commissions
without
power
to
order
the
consummation
of
a
merger
with
leaving
conditions
of
this
importance
unresolved?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
public
presumably
if
you
are
right
about
the
merger?
justice

the
advantage
to

the

of
