how
long
has
it
taken

get
to
the
point
that
we
are
now
in
reviewing
the
orders
that
we
are
dealing
with
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
like
the
next
will
do
the

it
is
broadly

--
chief

earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about

i'm
talking
about
the
review
in

that
followed
the

suggestion,
upholding
this
case
or
sending
it
back
to
the
lower

disposition
of
--
how
long
did
you
estimated
to
take
to
have
judicial
review
there?
chief

earl
warren
well,
that
would
be
about
six

then
your

did

depends
upon
the
willingness
of
the

subsidize
the
