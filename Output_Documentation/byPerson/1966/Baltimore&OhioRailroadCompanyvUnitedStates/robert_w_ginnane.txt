mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sharing
the
argument
with
counsel
for
the
appellees,
new
york
central
and
pennsylvania
railroads.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
would
be
determined
by
which
party
took
it
to
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
could
go
if
delaware
and
hudson
were
taken
at
the
court
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
because
their
headquarters
are
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
other
hand
norfolk
and
western,
if
they
took
it
to
court.
their
headquarters
are
in
the
rondo,
virginia.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
depend
upon
the
residents
of
the
original
plan,
the
first
plan.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
others
can
intervene.
and
what
happen
to
this
case
up
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
the
original
plaintiff
are
up
was
erie-lackawanna.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
they'd
clearly
have
the
right
venue
to
go
into
new
york.
then
everybody
else
happily
intervened.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
the
court
below
correctly
decided
both
of
them.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
correctly
refused
to
enjoin
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
until
the
problems
of
all
the
eastern
railroads
could
be
worked
out.
now,
some
of
the
appellants
seem
to
be
withdrawing
from
that
position
but
that's
what
they
put
in
their
briefs.
and
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
court
below
correctly
refused
to
stay
consummation
of
the
merger
while
the
commission
had
a
limited
further
proceeding
and
interim
protective
conditions
for
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine.
perhaps
it'd
be
useful
to
review
briefly
the
pattern
of
related
proceedings
and
the
pattern
of
participation
of
these
various
appellants
in
those
proceedings.
in
1962,
the
commission
authorized
c
&
o
to
acquire
control
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
at
that
time,
by
getting
them
the
commission
was
rejecting
suggestions
from
the
department
of
justice
and
other
persons
for
consolidation
of
the
c
&
o,
b
&
o
proceeding
with
the
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
and
penn-central
proceedings
which
were
just
getting
underway.
b
&
o
owns
a
38%
voting
interest
in
the
reading
and
the
reading
in
turn
controls
central
new
jersey
to
ownership
of
49%
of
its
stock.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
c
&
o
and
b
&
o
are
the
beneficial
owners
of
65%
of
the
voting
stock
of
western
maryland
and
that
they
now
have
pending
an
application
before
the
commission
for
authority
to
assume
actual
control
of
western
maryland.
so
if
all
of
the
railroad
appellants
except
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine
all
have
close
ties.
they
are
not
strangers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
lehigh
is
an
almost
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
present
norfolk
and
western
is
the
product
of
commission
orders
first
authorize
yet,
to
merge
with
the
virginia
railroad
and
then
later,
in
1964
authorizing
norfolk
and
western
to
merge
into
itself.
the
nickel
plate
it
takes
over
the
extensive
wabash
by
lease
and
some
related
but
still
significant
transactions.
the
effect
was
to
extend
norfolk
and
western
from
a
regional
coal
line
with
its
western
terminal
line
in
ohio
to
a
much
larger
system
reaching
to
chicago,
dumont,
peoria
and
saint
louis.
then
a
little
bit
more
than
regional
coal
carrying
railroad
now.
in
the
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
proceeding,
erie-lackawanna
petitioned
that
during
hearings
that
pursuant
to
section
5
(2)
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
it
be
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
system.
and
similar
petitions
were
filed
by
delaware
and
hudson
and
by
boston
and
maine.
during
the
hearings,
erie-lackawanna
withdrew
its
petition
for
inclusion
for
various
reasons.
one
of
which
was
admittedly,
is
a
very
poor
financial
position
was
admittedly
to
improve
its
earning
position
and
posture
if
possible
and
therefore
have
a
better
bargaining
position
with
norfolk
and
western
on
the
terms
of
inclusion.
so
that
meant
that
the
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
lacking
a
physical
connection
with
norfolk
and
western
since
erie-lackawanna
have
got
out
that
meant
that
their
inclusion
at
that
time
was
impossible.
but
the
commission
recognized
that
while
those
three
lines
were
also
petitioning
for
inclusion
of
the
penn-central
system.
but
there
was
an
obvious
reasons,
competitive
reasons
generally
recognizing
the
industry
that
it
might
well
be
probable
--
probably
would
be
probable
for
those
three
carriers
to
be
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
so
it
provided
in
condition
of
this
--
of
its
order
approving
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
merger
that
for
a
period
of
five
years,
anyone
of
those
three
lines
could
file
an
application
for
inclusion
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system
upon
terms
to
be
--
to
be
prescribed
by
the
commission.
and
that
condition
provided
that
consummation
by
nickel
--
by
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
of
any
transaction
approved
here
in
that
is
there
own
merger
shall
constitute
on
the
part
of
such
applicants,
acquiescence
in
and
irrevocable
ascent
to
a
condition
stated
in
the
appendix.
thereafter
that
merger
was
consummated
without
any
person
seeking
judicial
review
of
that
order.
later
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
pursuant
to
the
condition
had
filed
the
petitions
for
inclusion.
hearings
have
been
completed
and
as
you
heard
commissioner
webb
as
a
hearing
officer
has
issued
his
recommended
report.
in
that
recommended
report,
he
recommends
that
the
commission
require
the
norfolk
and
western
system
to
take
in
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson.
as
to
boston
and
maine,
he
would
not
require
inclusion.
he
would
not
require
norfolk
and
western
to
take
them
in
because
of
boston
and
maine's
financial
and
traffic
position.
but
however
he
would
authorize
norfolk
and
western
to
take
them
in.
but
not
now
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
exceptions,
briefs
and
presumably
oral
argument
before
the
entire
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
but
i
would
offer
a
careful
estimate
but
that
would
be
entirely
possible
for
that
to
be
completed
including
the
decisional
stage
by
the
first
of
july
or
the
first
of
august.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it
could
--
depending
upon
how
it
was
pushed
and
where
it
could
run
and
incidents
of
judicial
review
from
six
months
to
two
years.
when
the
last
big
card
was
laid
in
the
table
in
october
1965,
when
the
norfolk
and
western
and
c
&
o
filed
to
the
commission
an
application
for
approval
of
their
merger.
that
would
be
the
nor
--
the
old
norfolk
--
with
the
norfol
and
western-nickel
plate
plus
the
c
&
o
and
b
&
o
combination
into
a
single
system.
and
they
offered
to
include
on
specified
terms
which
have
not
yet
been
accepted,
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine,
the
reading,
and
the
central
new
jersey,
all
of
the
orphans.
of
course
it
was
subject
to
significant
conditions
--
qualifications.
one,
being
modification
of
present
federal
tax
law
to
permit
norfolk
and
western
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
operating
laws
carry
overs
of
the
erie-lackawanna,
boston
and
maine,
reading
and
central
new
jersey.
now
those
would
have
a
tax
value
of
something
in
the
dimension
of
a
$100
million
or
more.
so
you
can
see
that
while
this
latest
merger
plan
which
would
include
all
five
of
the
so-called
orphan
lines
were
considerably
it
maybe
found
that
be
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
still
a
very
complicated
transaction
and
the
date
that
it
could
be
put
it
into
effect
even
if
the
level
of
commission
decision
to
say
nothing
of
court
review.
there's
an
imponderable
period.
we
may
be
talking
about
two
years.
we
may
be
talking
about
five.
finally,
returning
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
contentions
of
ches
--
of
chicago
and
eastern
illinois,
i
call
the
attention
that
in
february
of
this
year,
february
of
1965.
the
commission
authorized
missouri
pacific
to
acquire
stock
control
of
appellant
c
&
e
i
upon
condition
that
mopac
and
c
&
e
i
negotiate
with
the
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
with
the
latter
to
operate
over
c
&
e
i,
chicago
to
evansville
branch
subject
to
the
subsequent
approval
of
the
commission.
commission's
order
was
sustained
by
a
three-judge
court
and
it
was
affirmed
today
by
this
court.
so
c
&
e
i
apparently
or
that
one
can
tell
is
on
its
way
to
inclusion
in
the
considerably
larger
missouri
pacific
system.
in
march
1962,
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
file
their
merger
application
to
the
commission
and
there
followed
extensive
hearings,
a
129
days
of
hearings
in
a
large
number
of
cities
for
the
convenience
of
witnesses.
and
it's
important
to
note
the
role
these
present
appellants
to
plead
in
that
litigation
and
some
of
the
appellees.
the
trustees
of
the
new
haven
in
the
reorganization
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
participated
actively
and
urged
that
approval
of
any
merger
be
conditioned
upon
the
inclusion
of
new
haven
pursuant
to
the
inclusion
of
the
section
5
(2)
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
they
contented
that
continuance
of
new
haven's
vital
services
in
southern
new
england
could
be
insured
only
by
inclusion
in
a
larger
rail
system
and
this
was
the
only
possibility
for
inclusion
which
they
could
see.
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine,
they
participated
actively.
asserting
that
as
independent
carriers
they
couldn't
withstand
the
enhanced
competition
that
would
result
from
a
merged
penn-central
and
so
there,
except
the
merger
be
disapprove
if
they
could
not
be
included
in
the
larger
system.
and
specifically
they
asked
the
commission
provide
to
their
subsequent
inclusion
of
the
penn-central
merger
for
their
inclusion
of
them
in
a
penn-central
merger
in
the
event
they
were
unable
to
obtain
inclusion
of
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
now,
turning
to
the
others
now
before
the
court,
norfolk
and
western
did
not
participate
in
the
hearing
or
otherwise
until
they
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
now,
we
are
told
that
that
was
because
they
were
under
pennsylvania
control.
alright,
i'll
accept
that.
when
they
filed
this
petition
for
reconsideration,
they
were
not
under
pennsylvania
control
and
the
petition
for
reconsideration
simply
did
not
asked
the
commission
for
the
relief
they
are
now
seeking
from
the
court.
chesapeake
in
ohio,
baltimore
in
ohio
and
ready
intervened
their
request
that
they
offered
no
evidence
in
opposition
to
the
merger
or
to
the
effects
of
the
inclusion
of
new
haven,
erie-lackawanna,
boston
and
maine,
delaware
and
hudson.
william
and
mary
--
western
maryland
participated
and
presented
evidence
in
a
specific
competitive
angle
which
is
no
longer
involved
in
the
litigation.
central
new
jersey
did
not
petition
at
least
to
intervene
in
the
proceedings
until
after
they
closed
the
hearing.
the
city
of
scranton
offered
only
a
single
witness.
the
purport
of
whose
prepared
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
erie-lackawanna
was
of
vital
importance
to
that
locality.
no
brief
was
filed
to
the
hearing
examiner
by
scranton.
shapp
testified
and
introduced
an
exhibit
in
opposition
to
the
merger.
the
railway
labor
executive
association
withdrew
its
opposition
to
the
merger
after
the
applicants
had
entered
into
an
agreement
for
the
protection
of
employees
through
attrition.
generally
speaking
under
attrition,
nobody
looses
his
job
unless
he
dies
or
retires.
there
are
other
qualifications
to
it.
but
it
roughly
--
its
employees
are
adversely
affected
only
through
attrition.
so
labor
is
out
of
the
case.
and
the
department
of
justice
strongly
opposed
the
merger
both
in
hearing
and
on
brief.
the
commission
in
its
final
report
issued
after
exceptions
the
examiner's
report
and
oral
argument.
the
commission
adopted
as
its
own,
the
report
of
the
hearing
officers
except
as
otherwise
indicated.
so
that
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
consists
not
merely
of
this
document
but
of
the
larger
a
--
but
by
the
larger
examiner's
report,
copies
of
which
have
been
made
available
to
the
court.
the
commission's
unanimous
conclusion
that
penn-central
merger
appropriately
conditioned
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
is
supported
by
such
basic
findings
as
these,
that
during
the
period
1960
and
1964,
penn
and
central
could
not
make
a
profit
out
of
transportation
operations.
the
annual
savings
from
the
merger
will
exceed
$80
million
after
eight
years.
and
the
merger
with
and
because
of
its
resulting
savings
will
result
and
substantially
improve
transportation
service
to
a
large
shipping
public.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
in
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
that
was
put
to
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
commission's
reaction
was
we
are
not
going
to
assume
from
the
short
period
of
time
that
our
earlier
finding
based
upon
a
longer
period
should
be
scrapped.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
i
think
they
could
have.
yes,
a
very
broad
discretion
under
section
5
as
to
whether
to
approve
or
disapprove.
i
have
no
doubt
if
the
commission
could
have
changed
this
one.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
it
didn't,
it
refused
to
change
his
mind.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
petition
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
are
unwilling
to
avail
--
were
unwilling
to
assume
that
the
business
that
they'll
be
no
further
business
cycle
and
that
penn-central
earnings
were
going
to
continue
indefinitely
to
the
1965,
1966
(inaudible)
and
we
have
already
seen
slight
intonations
that
perhaps
the
commission
wasn't
justified
in
its
skepticism.
as
to
the
service
improvements,
they
were
described
better
than
i
can
do
it,
in
the
petition
for
reconsideration
filed
by
c
&
o,
b
&
o.
they
said,
a
merged
penn-central
will
generate
large
savings
and
touch
off
a
significant
drive
to
the
type
of
broad
gauge
service
improvements
which
is
the
very
purpose
of
the
merger.
there
will
be
funds
available
for
the
acquisitions
of
additional
equipment
including
special
equipments
and
so
on.
c
&
o,
b
&
o
believed
that
basically
the
merger
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
notwithstanding
this
substantial
adverse
effect
that
will
have
on
our
traffic
and
revenues.
now
of
course
the
merger
will
produce
better
service
to
the
public.
that's
where
its
for
--
that
where
produces
is
competitive
bite.
therell
be
more
to
the
merger
than
many
adjust
the
internal
savings.
it
will
produce
better
service
and
that's
why
all
these
appellant
carriers
are
in
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
it
produces
much
more
single
line
movements.
and
in
this
merger,
what
is
going
to
take
place
although
shapp
complains
of
it,
there
will
be
a
concentration
of
track
and
the
longer
and
heavier
trains.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
all
you
--
or
you
--
all
you
can
think
of
really
is
just
traffic
in
one
particular
area.
but
it
--
it
is
true
that
here.
there'll
be
a
concentration
of
traffic
from
certain
areas
over
new
york
central's
water
level
route.
now,
its
not
just
shifting
of
traffic,
it's
the
fact
that's
its
concentrated
into
longer
and
heavier
trains
that
produces
very
large
operating
economies
and
faster
service
in
many,
many
cases.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
one
minute?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
true
or
not
your
honor.
i
know
--
i
do
know
that
this
is
--
this
is
about
the
only
country
in
the
world
where
that
has
not
happen.
that
this
is
the
--
that
we
have
--
what
we
have
the
only
privately
owned
railroad
system
in
the
world
operating
with
the
considerable
degree
of
competition,
paying
heavy
taxes
and
so
on,
and
many,
many
people
believe.
and
is
reflected
this
commission's
decision
that
is
the
right
type
of
rail
merger
are
necessary
to
keep
our
system
going
the
way
we
want
it
and
indeed
to
improve
it.
the
right
type
of
merger
is
necessary
to
not
only
keep
the
kind
of
railroad
service
we
have
but
to
improve.
as
to
the
new
haven,
the
commission
found
that
its
services
were
essential
to
the
public
and
that
new
haven
not
only
had
no
other
place
to
got
than
in
a
larger
rail
line
but
that
it
would
be
injured
by
a
merged
penn-central.
so
the
commission
imposed
as
a
condition
subsequent
to
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
that
all
of
new
haven's
operations
freight
and
passenger
be
included.
of
course
the
terms
with
inclusion
will
be
subject
to
this
further
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
to
the
approval
of
bankruptcy
court.
as
to
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine,
the
commission
noted
that
it
had
reserved
an
opportunity
for
their
inclusion
for
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
at
the
same,
the
commission
recognized
that
the
very
savings
an
improved
service
which
would
justify
finding
a
penn-central
merger
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
it
meant
that
a
substantial
amount
of
traffic
could
be
diverted
from
penn
--
from
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine
and
erie-lackawanna.
so
it
did
two
things.
first,
it
provided
a
second
opportunity
for
inclusion
of
those
three
lines
in
a
major
system.
what
provided
that
if
the
applicant
--
if
the
petitioner
one
of
them
for
inclusion
in
norfolk
and
western
was
denied
then
it
could
apply
for
inclusion
in
the
penn-central
system
and
the
commission
reserved
jurisdiction
to
require
its
inclusion
on
the
prescribed
terms?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
have
several
opportunities.
i'd
be
glad
to
divert
very
briefly.
they
now
say
that
the
reason
they
didn't
show
up
in
the
hearing
before
the
commission
was
that
they
didn't
know
that
new
haven
was
going
to
be
included
in
the
merger.
now,
that
won't
hold
up.
new
haven's
application
for
inclusion
in
penn-central
was
widely
and
publicly
supported,
noisily
supported
by
all
the
public
bodies
to
northeast.
and
for
anyone
to
assume,
for
any
railroad
management
to
assume
that
new
haven
would
not
be
included
merely
because
penn-central
said
they
didn't
want
to
be
included
was
simply
naive.
anyway
in
authorizing
new
haven's
into
--
in
requiring
new
haven's
inclusion,
commission
has
provided
that
in
this
hearing
which
was
--
which
starts
in
january
on
the
terms
of
new
haven
inclusion,
central
new
jersey
and
reading
can
have
an
opportunity
to
testify,
to
be
heard
on
what
condition
should
attest
to
the
new
haven
inclusion
to
protect
their
roots
with
new
haven.
now,
as
you
--
of
course
you
also
have
been
told
that
this
new
haven
inclusion
isn't
going
to
happen
tonight.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
is
not
going
to
happen
overnight.
it'll
be
a
good
two
years
everybody
now
that
raised
there
can
be
an
actual
inclusion
of
new
haven
and
before
central
new
jersey
could
feel
this
anticipated
injury.
central
new
jersey
also
says
they
didn't
know
that
the
commission
was
going
to
reserve
jurisdiction
to
require
pennsylvania,
to
give
traffic
rights
to
delaware
and
hudson
over
a
stretch
between
wilkes-barre
and
hagerstown.
that's
just
a
second
string
to
the
bow
which
the
commission
has
reserved
to
provide
delaware
and
hudson
with
the
physical
connection
with
norfolk
and
western.
it
may
never
occur.
in
any
event,
if
it
does,
it
will
be
only
after
a
further
opportunity
before
the
commission
and
central
new
jersey
can
be
heard
on
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
seems
to
be.
there
is
another
which
i
do
not
specifically
recall
and
that
too
would
be
--
is
the
--
would
be
the
subject
of
a
further
hearing
before
it
took
place.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
these
interim
protected
conditions.
they
complained
about
the
impact
of
the
interim
protective
conditions
your
honor
and
they
have
--
and
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
they
had
their
opportunity
each
of
them
--
to
call
them
in.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
believe
they
were.
i
believe
they
were
present
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
they
were
there
and
they
presented
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
they'll
have
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
as
to
--
effect
of
a
new
haven
inclusion
upon
them
in
the
very
near
future.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
these
appellants
filed
a
various
petitions
for
reconsideration
in
the
commission's
report
and
order.
i
would
like
to
refer
a
layer
to
the
extent
that
which
their
petitions
did
not
raised
the
contentions
which
they
now
present
to
the
courts.
but
for
present
purposes,
it
should
be
noted
that
all
of
the
railroad
appellants
requested
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
the
admittedly
noble
interim
protective
conditions.
so
on
the
commission's
report
on
reconsideration
september
1966,
the
commission
did
two
things.
it
reopened
the
proceedings
for
further
hearings
limited
to
this
special
traffic
and
indemnity
provisions
in
appendix
g.
it
provided
that
the
traffic
conditions
would
remain
in
effect
assuming
a
consummation
until
change
after
hearing.
it
rescinded
the
indemnity
condition
but
provided
that
any
indemnity
provision
which
might
be
devised
would
be
imposed
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
at
the
same
time,
notwithstanding
its
action
in
reopening
the
proceeding
for
further
hearing
on
the
traffic
and
indemnity
conditions,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
public
interest
requires
prompt
consummation
of
the
proposed
merger.
now,
the
complaints
have
been
filed
in
the
court
below
before
the
commission
had
issues
report
on
reconsideration
and
with
that
report
issued,
the
principal
issue
and
the
view
of
the
court
below
was
whether
the
commission
had
authorized
in
erring
cons
--
in
authorizing
consummation
of
the
merger
while
conducting
these
further
hearings
on
special
commissions.
in
a
detailed
analysis,
the
court
below
held
that
the
commission
had
not
heard.
secondarily,
although
little
argued
in
the
court
below,
the
court
below
held
that
was
no
merit
in
contentions
that
consummation
of
the
merger
should
be
deferred
until
conclusion
of
all
pending
rail
merger
proceedings
relating
to
the
northeastern
united
states.
turning
to
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice,
they
tell
the
court
that
the
agencies
are
the
executive
branch
that
had
substantive
responsibilities
for
the
formulation
of
economic
and
transportation
policies,
believe
that
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that
its
consummation
should
be
promptly
affected.
they
point
out
that
the
railroad
industry
of
the
northeast
is
an
urgent
need
of
rapid
modernization
and
believe
that
as
a
practical
matter,
substantial
consolidation
among
existing
systems
will
be
necessary
to
achieve
this
end.
thus,
those
federal
agencies
enjoin
the
states
of
pennsylvania,
new
york,
connecticut,
rhode
island,
and
massachusetts
in
supporting
this
merger.
it
is
unprecedented
support
for
such
a
transaction
by
public
bodies
responsible
to
the
welfare
of
the
large
segments
of
the
country.
it
is
clear
that
the
department
is
urging
delay
and
consummation
until
the
commission
determines
the
inclusion
petitions
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
for
inclusion
of
norfolk
and
western.
we
have
been
uncertain,
i
still
am,
as
to
whether
they
are
also
urging
delay
until
the
commission
determines
the
norfolk
and
western,
c
&
o
merger
application
and
the
precise
terms
and
until
it
determines
the
precise
terms
for
the
inclusion
of
new
haven.
because
that
the
more
of
those
things
you
will
put
in
as
a
bar
to
consummation,
the
more
we
are
talking
about
years.
just
the
--
not
just
the
few
friendly
months,
we're
talking
about
years.
in
any
event
at
that
point
the
department
says,
“this
court
should
not
now
decide
whether
the
commission
and
the
court
below
were
in
error”.
there
is
just
at
this
commission
hold
the
case
while
the
commission
completes
the
related
proceedings
so
that
this
court
won't
have
to
decide,
the
case
now
before
the
court.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
i
--
they
requested
really
which
ask
this
court
to
simply
stay
consummation
on
the
merger
without
determining
whether
the
court
below
erred
in
refusing
it
to
do
so.
but
at
that
point,
the
court
is
asking
--
the
department
is
asking
this
court
to
engage
in
the
administrative
and
non-judicial
function
of
regulating
the
commission's
docket.
so
that
the
things
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
court
should
not
do.
we
submit
that
the
commission
and
the
many
parties
and
indeed
the
court
below
are
entitled
to
a
decision.
and
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
particularly
in
the
reply
briefs
that
the
railroad
appellants
in
number
642,
norfolk
and
western
et
al.
and
the
central
new
jersey
in
its
reply
brief,
although
it
had
the
original
brief
are
now
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
approval
and
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
must
be
deferred
until
a
solution
is
found
for
all
the
lines
in
the
east.
we
submit
that
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
the
interim
protective
conditions?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
commissioner
--
the
commission
has
completed
this
hearing
in
those.
the
briefing
process
will
be
completed
by
february
6.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
like
to
be
careful
on
these
matters
particularly
in
--
i
like
to
be
very
careful
in
expressing
an
opinion
on
this
matter.
but
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
commission
could
finally
determine
those
protective
conditions
not
later
than
the
first
of
june.
possibly
earlier
but
i
would
not
want
to
express
an
earlier
date
not
later
in
the
first
of
june
in
my
judgment.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
have
to
answer
to
that
in
two
ways.
that's
just
the
administrative
process.
now,
certainly
the
whole
posture
of
this
litigation
strongly
suggests
that
no
matter
what
the
commission
proscribes,
one
--
one
of
these
carrier
factions
will
take
it
to
court.
so
the
next
question
will
be
to
the
merger
be
--
accept
consummation
be
further
deferred
until
judicial
review
of
the
interim
protected
conditions.
then
secondly,
that's
only
the
first
half
of
the
court
ruling.
they
say,
that
the
consummation
should
be
deferred
clearly
until
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine
is
settled
and
presumably
with
judicial
review
of
fact.
there
is
--
there's
just
no
way
we
--
anybody
can
be
sure
that
this
merger
could
possibly
go
into
--
that
this
--
that
the
delay
of
consummation
involved
in
differing
it
until
the
commission
comes
out
to
its
report
on
this
interim
special
conditions
would
involved
only
a
few
months.
it
depends
upon
what
happens
to
the
next
stage.
will
the
courts
--
will
the
courts
stay
up
further
pending
judicial
review
of
the
conditions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
the
reasons
given
by
the
rather
the
commission
boil
down
to
this.
it
had
found
that
the
merger
would
produce
improved
transportation
to
public
and
substantial
benefits
to
appellees,
$80
million
a
year
when
the
merger
is
fully
implemented.
secondarily,
it
had
found
that
that
inclusion
of
the
penn-central
merger
is
the
only
solution
that
anybody
has
really
proposed
for
continuance
of
new
haven
services.
and
the
commission
articulated
it
that
if
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
is
deferred
for
several
years
or
indefinitely,
that
the
commission,
neither
the
commission
or
the
courts
can
it
--
can
have
any
assurance
that
it
will
ever
take
place
and
if
something
happens
that
it
doesn't
take
place,
nobody
has
any
solution
in
mind
for
continuation
of
new
haven's
services.
then
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
on
the
other
hand
the
commission
pointed
out,
that
we're
talking
about
the
interim
protection
now,
not
the
long
wage.
commission
pointed
out
that
putting
together
a
merger
of
this
size
is
a
vast
complex
and
slow
task.
for
example,
mr.
white
depressed
in
the
erie-lackawanna
in
speaking
with
the
further
authority
of
a
former
vice
president
of
new
york
central,
so
he
had
seen
both
side
of
this
competitive
relationship.
he
testified
to
the
commission
even
before
the
commission
had
announced
any
interim
protective
conditions
that
would
be
the
second
year
before
a
penn-central
merger
could
have
a
significant
impact
upon
erie-lackawanna,
that
it
would
have
no
effect
of
the
first
year
so
that
there
--
so
that
these
conditions
don't
have
to
be
affected
the
first
day
at
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
secondly,
penn-central
have
pledged
themselves
not
to
seek
judicial
review
of
the
appendix
g
conditions
which
the
commission
have
revised.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they'll
accept
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
the
--
as
to
the
appendix
g
conditions.
they
have
not
waived
judicial
review
on
capital
--
on
indemnity
for
capital
loss.
result
is
that
in
a
fairly
short
period
of
time,
certainly
this
spring
or
early
summer.
as
far
as
the
commission
and
penn-central
are
concerned,
a
set
of
protective
condition
can
be
in
effect.
now,
perhaps
others
can
go
to
court
and
get
them
stayed
that
as
far
as
the
applicants
and
the
commission
are
concerned,
there
will
be
a
set
of
conditions
in
effect
long
before
this
merger
could
have
a
real
competitive
bite.
secondly,
there
is
no
principle
of
law
that
anyone
of
these
appellant
railroads
has
to
be
guaranteed
100%
protection
against
diversion
of
traffic.
as
the
court
below
said,
what
they're
entitled
to
is
protection
against
such
diversion
of
traffic
as
will
impair
their
viability,
their
ability
to
provide
adequate
service
to
their
service
areas.
erie-lackawanna
has
testify
--
has
advised
the
commission
in
its
reply
brief,
in
the
inclusion
proceeding
that
it
is
confident
that
the
commission
can
device
reasonable
--
reasonably
adequate
protective
conditions.
now,
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
this
and
--
the
kind
of
indemnity
we're
talking
about,
interim
indemnity,
if
the
commission
should
prescribed
one.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
is
--
it
would
be
on
a
scale
the
only
fraction
of
the
merger
savings
because
the
indemnity
would
be
phrased
not
in
terms
of
a
reduction
in
gross
revenues
but
the
reduction
in
net
earnings.
and
we're
talking
about
a
sum
which
even
is
applied
to
all
three
railroads
would
be
a
few
million
dollars
a
year.
a
small
fraction
of
the
merger
savings
and
that's
why
penn-central
are
so
confident
of
that,
that's
why
they
committed
themselves
to
accept
the
--
any
temporary
indemnity
provision
that
they
know
what's
a
manageable
sum
that's
involved.
one
brief
point
sir,
the
norfolk
and
western
c
--
central
of
new
jersey
group
of
appellants,
c
&
o
and
b
&
o,
are
insist
--
have
been
urging
before
the
lower
court
and
this
court
that
any
kind
of
indemnity
provision
if
adopted
will
create
a
community
of
interest
between
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
on
the
one
hand
and
a
merged
penn-central
on
the
other
hand
which
will
cause
them
to
divert
traffic
to
each
other
and
away
from
norfolk
and
western,
c
&
j
and
so
on.
this
to
which
they
now
attach
which
they
view
as
such
great
alarm
was
not
even
mentioned
by
c
&
j
and
norfolk
and
western
in
their
petitions
for
reconsideration
to
the
commission.
from
which
i
conclude
and
it
was
barely
mentioned
by
c
&
o,
b
&
o
from
which
i
conclude
that
since
they
have
so
recently
foreseen
the
stature
that
it
must
be
one
with
which
the
commission
can
cope
in
the
formulation
of
conditions
after
a
hearing.
and
one
further
point
on
the
efficacy
of
these
conditions
to
protect
these
three
carriers
pending
consummation
of
this
merger
and
their
inclusion
in
another
system
and
this
might
--
frankly,
this
might
be
more
important
in
the
right
to
judicial
review.
they
will
be
subject
to
constant
revision
by
the
commission
on
the
light
experience
pursuant
to
section
5
(9)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
admittedly,
they're
noble
and
we
might
learn
quite
a
good
deal
by
experience
with
them
as
we
go
along.
and
the
commission
would
have
to
retain
jurisdiction
to
modify
those
conditions
to
ensure
that
they
give
adequate
protection
to
the
three
without
causing
undue
injury
to
the
others.
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
seriously,
the
other
issue
in
the
case.
it's
been
muted
today
but
it's
here
and
that
is
that
consummation
of
this
merger
should
be
deferred
not
merely
until
protected
conditions
are
prescribed
in
a
few
months
by
the
commission.
but
that
consummation
should
be
deferred
until
act
--
until
the
inclusion
of
the
three
protected
lines
and
is
finally
determined.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
resuming,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
contention
of
some
of
the
appellant
railroads
and
the
department
of
justice
that
consummation
of
a
penn-central
merger
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
be
permitted
until
every
small
line,
the
orphans
as
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
them
are
fitted
into
a
larger
rail
system.
the
court
below
held
and
we
submit
correctly
that
this
is
not
required.
of
course
it
would
be
the
ideal
decisional
situation,
but
it
just
doesn't
happen.
from
1920
until
1940,
congress
had
a
state
of
--
stated
objective,
the
consolidation
of
the
nation's
railroads
and
to
what
it
characterized
as
a
limited
number
of
rail
systems,
and
it
authorized
the
commission
to
approve
carrier
initiated
proposals
for
unification
which
were
consonant
with
this
pre-determined
plan
which
the
commission
was
to
draw
up.
this
court
recognized
in
its
decisions
in
schwabacher
and
in
st.
joe
paper
company
that
the
planned
approach
failed,
and
the
principal
reason
it
failed
was
that
the
commission
lacked
power
to
initiate
or
to
compel
mergers.
section
5
was
complete
--
completely
rewritten
in
1940.
this
court
has
noted
in
the
county
of
marin
case
that
the
end
of
congress,
its
objective
remained
the
same,
the
only
thing
that
changed
was
the
means.
under
the
present
section
5,
the
only
planning
or
coercive
power
which
the
commission
has
is
the
power
to
condition
its
approval
of
a
carrier
initiated
merger
by
requiring
the
inclusion
of
other
railroads
in
the
territory
if
they
petition
for
inclusion.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
commission
had
no
control
over
the
timing
of
c&o-b&o,
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate,
penn-central
merger
applications.
it
had
no
control
over
erie-lackawanna's
withdrawal
of
its
original
petition
for
inclusion
in
norfolk
and
western,
a
withdrawal
to
improve
its
bargaining
position.
and
again
on
this
case,
the
court
had
--
the
commission
has
no
control
over
the
non-participation
in
its
hearing
of
the
railroad
appellants
in
642.
since
1940,
the
commissioners
authorized
to
approve
carrier
mergers
or
unifications
which
it
finds
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
upon
just
and
reasonable
terms.
here,
the
commission
approved
a
penn-central
merger
and
authorized
its
consummation,
while
reserving
jurisdiction
to
provide
opportunities
for
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
and
norfolk
and
western
are
in
a
penn-central
system.
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
of
the
department
and
the
railroad
appellants
in
642
that
they
are
asking
that
consummation
of
penn-central
which
they,
along
with
the
northeastern
states
and
the
executive
--
and
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government,
generally
favor
as
being
in
the
public
interest.
they
ask
that
as
consummation
be
deferred
indefinitely
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
by
the
commission
and
inevitably
they
mean
by
the
courts
of
the
faith
of
a
smaller
railroads
in
the
northeast.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
think
that
question
is
in
the
case
before
your
honors
but
i
think
that's
a
separate
question.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
guess
pretty
yes.
i'm
addressing
myself
now
to
broader
confession
which
is
involved
in
the
case
and
which
was
ruled
on
by
the
court
below.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
means
under
their
contention,
deferment
of
consummation
until
determination
of
the
newly
proposed
n&w-c&o
dereco
plan
and
look
what's
involved
there.
after
hearing
that
might
be
that
the
commission
can
fix
terms
for
the
inclusion
in
that
system
if
it
approves
it,
of
norfolk
and
western
of
central
of
new
jersey
and
reading,
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine.
but
it
cannot
compel
anyone
of
those
small
lines
to
accept
those
terms.
and
indeed
if
norfolk
and
western
c&o
don't
like
the
terms,
they
can
decline
to
go
ahead
with
their
merger
or
they
may
litigate
the
terms.
in
effect
it
forced
the
commission
into
the
discarded
planning
approach
of
1920
and
still
without
the
powers
of
coercion
which
underlying
to
the
failure
of
the
1920
planning
approach.
the
practical
point
is
that
if
--
that
proceedings
either
to
determine
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
and
boston
and
maine
into
the
present
norfolk
and
western
system
or
under
their
--
and
to
their
broader
proposed
system
with
the
dereco
plan,
with
court
proceedings,
the
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings
were
talking
about
delay,
not
measured
in
months,
but
in
terms
of
years,
three,
four
or
five
years.
and
we
submit
that
the
commission
in
its
report
on
reconsideration
was
wholly
realistic
in
concluding
that
if
the
penn-central
merger
with
a
substantially
unchallenged
major
public
benefits
is
not
--
is
differed
for
that
longer
period,
there
can
be
no
assurance
that
it
will
ever
take
place.
we
point
out
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
determination
of
the
interim
protective
conditions?
yes,
as
i
stated
yesterday,
i
am
fairly
confident
that
the
commission's
report
determining
those
after
the
hearing
those
interim
protective
conditions
will
be
out
by
june
1.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
cannot
predict
what
would
happen
in
the
courts
after
that.
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
from
the
present
posture
of
this
--
the
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct.
the
applicants
penn-central
have
down
themselves
to
accept
without
judicial
review
the
traffic
and
temporary
indemnity
provisions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
other
side
is
free
to
seek
judicial
review
but
stays
pending
appeal
--
all
of
the
other
time
possibilities
that
are
available.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
i
didn't
but
i
may
say
that
the
lowest
estimate
that
i
have
heard
of
the
time
involved
to
bring
about
actual
inclusion
of
new
haven
is
two
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct
and
i
don't
like
to
candid.
that
might
be
a
conservative
estimate.
it
would
certainly
be
a
record
performance
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
essentially,
it
consists
of
a
sale
of
assets.
all
assets
are
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
plan
applied
to
the
proceeds.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
determining
the
price
--
what
is
a
fair
and
adequate
price.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
this
has
been
a
marvelously
expedited
procedure
which
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
case
comes
up
in
a
remarkable
posture
your
honor.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
serious
attack
on
the
merits
of
the
merger
and
that's
why
the
huge
record
in
this
proceeding,
the
huge
evidentiary
record
in
this
proceeding
has
not
been
filed
with
the
courts
by
any
party.
now
when
we
get
into
new
haven,
valuation
proceeding
essentially,
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
if
the
creditor
hoops,
“let
us
get
by
that
lightly.”
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
more
authoritative
estimate
on
my
own.
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
estimated
that
it
would
be
to
the
end
of
1967
at
the
best.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
six
months
from
then
and
a
year
from
now.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
was
unwilling
to
exceed
the
request
for
consummation
for
merger
for
two
reasons.
the
merits
of
the
merger
almost
uniquely
were
not
being
challenged.
there
was
no
challenge,
essentially
no
challenge
to
each
findings
as
to
the
substantial
service
improvements
which
would
result
for
large
segments
of
the
shipping
public
and
to
the
almost
incredible
annual
savings
of
$80
million
a
year
which
the
carriers
can
achieve.
in
addition,
the
commission
sought
consummation
of
a
penn-central
merger
as
the
only
solution
for
the
continuance
of
new
haven's
transportation
services.
no
one
has
proposed
a
new
haven
solution
other
than
inclusion
in
this
merger.
under
the
statute,
the
commission
cannot,
it
has
no
power
to
require
penn
or
central
or
any
other
carrier
separately
to
take
on
any
of
new
haven's
operations.
its
only
power
is
under
5(2)(d)
to
require
inclusion
of
new
haven
as
a
condition
to
approval
of
this
merger.
this
is
the
only
solution
for
new
haven.
in
contrast,
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine,
they
have
in
sight
several
possibilities.
inclusion
in
penn-central
is
the
only
possibility
for
new
haven.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sharing
the
argument
with
counsel
for
the
appellees,
new
york
central
and
pennsylvania
railroads.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
would
be
determined
by
which
party
took
it
to
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
could
go
if
delaware
and
hudson
were
taken
at
the
court
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
because
their
headquarters
are
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
other
hand
norfolk
and
western,
if
they
took
it
to
court.
their
headquarters
are
in
the
rondo,
virginia.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
depend
upon
the
residents
of
the
original
plan,
the
first
plan.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
others
can
intervene.
and
what
happen
to
this
case
up
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
the
original
plaintiff
are
up
was
erie-lackawanna.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
they'd
clearly
have
the
right
venue
to
go
into
new
york.
then
everybody
else
happily
intervened.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
the
court
below
correctly
decided
both
of
them.
we
believe
that
the
court
below
correctly
refused
to
enjoin
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
until
the
problems
of
all
the
eastern
railroads
could
be
worked
out.
now,
some
of
the
appellants
seem
to
be
withdrawing
from
that
position
but
that's
what
they
put
in
their
briefs.
and
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
court
below
correctly
refused
to
stay
consummation
of
the
merger
while
the
commission
had
a
limited
further
proceeding
and
interim
protective
conditions
for
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine.
perhaps
it'd
be
useful
to
review
briefly
the
pattern
of
related
proceedings
and
the
pattern
of
participation
of
these
various
appellants
in
those
proceedings.
in
1962,
the
commission
authorized
c
&
o
to
acquire
control
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
at
that
time,
by
getting
them
the
commission
was
rejecting
suggestions
from
the
department
of
justice
and
other
persons
for
consolidation
of
the
c
&
o,
b
&
o
proceeding
with
the
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
and
penn-central
proceedings
which
were
just
getting
underway.
b
&
o
owns
a
38%
voting
interest
in
the
reading
and
the
reading
in
turn
controls
central
new
jersey
to
ownership
of
49%
of
its
stock.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
c
&
o
and
b
&
o
are
the
beneficial
owners
of
65%
of
the
voting
stock
of
western
maryland
and
that
they
now
have
pending
an
application
before
the
commission
for
authority
to
assume
actual
control
of
western
maryland.
so
if
all
of
the
railroad
appellants
except
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine
all
have
close
ties.
they
are
not
strangers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
lehigh
is
an
almost
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
present
norfolk
and
western
is
the
product
of
commission
orders
first
authorize
yet,
to
merge
with
the
virginia
railroad
and
then
later,
in
1964
authorizing
norfolk
and
western
to
merge
into
itself.
the
nickel
plate
it
takes
over
the
extensive
wabash
by
lease
and
some
related
but
still
significant
transactions.
the
effect
was
to
extend
norfolk
and
western
from
a
regional
coal
line
with
its
western
terminal
line
in
ohio
to
a
much
larger
system
reaching
to
chicago,
dumont,
peoria
and
saint
louis.
then
a
little
bit
more
than
regional
coal
carrying
railroad
now.
in
the
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
proceeding,
erie-lackawanna
petitioned
that
during
hearings
that
pursuant
to
section
5
(2)
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
it
be
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
system.
and
similar
petitions
were
filed
by
delaware
and
hudson
and
by
boston
and
maine.
during
the
hearings,
erie-lackawanna
withdrew
its
petition
for
inclusion
for
various
reasons.
one
of
which
was
admittedly,
is
a
very
poor
financial
position
was
admittedly
to
improve
its
earning
position
and
posture
if
possible
and
therefore
have
a
better
bargaining
position
with
norfolk
and
western
on
the
terms
of
inclusion.
so
that
meant
that
the
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
lacking
a
physical
connection
with
norfolk
and
western
since
erie-lackawanna
have
got
out
that
meant
that
their
inclusion
at
that
time
was
impossible.
but
the
commission
recognized
that
while
those
three
lines
were
also
petitioning
for
inclusion
of
the
penn-central
system.
but
there
was
an
obvious
reasons,
competitive
reasons
generally
recognizing
the
industry
that
it
might
well
be
probable
--
probably
would
be
probable
for
those
three
carriers
to
be
included
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
so
it
provided
in
condition
of
this
--
of
its
order
approving
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
merger
that
for
a
period
of
five
years,
anyone
of
those
three
lines
could
file
an
application
for
inclusion
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system
upon
terms
to
be
--
to
be
prescribed
by
the
commission.
and
that
condition
provided
that
consummation
by
nickel
--
by
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate
of
any
transaction
approved
here
in
that
is
there
own
merger
shall
constitute
on
the
part
of
such
applicants,
acquiescence
in
and
irrevocable
ascent
to
a
condition
stated
in
the
appendix.
thereafter
that
merger
was
consummated
without
any
person
seeking
judicial
review
of
that
order.
later
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
pursuant
to
the
condition
had
filed
the
petitions
for
inclusion.
hearings
have
been
completed
and
as
you
heard
commissioner
webb
as
a
hearing
officer
has
issued
his
recommended
report.
in
that
recommended
report,
he
recommends
that
the
commission
require
the
norfolk
and
western
system
to
take
in
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson.
as
to
boston
and
maine,
he
would
not
require
inclusion.
he
would
not
require
norfolk
and
western
to
take
them
in
because
of
boston
and
maine's
financial
and
traffic
position.
but
however
he
would
authorize
norfolk
and
western
to
take
them
in.
but
not
now
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
exceptions,
briefs
and
presumably
oral
argument
before
the
entire
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
but
i
would
offer
a
careful
estimate
but
that
would
be
entirely
possible
for
that
to
be
completed
including
the
decisional
stage
by
the
first
of
july
or
the
first
of
august.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it
could
--
depending
upon
how
it
was
pushed
and
where
it
could
run
and
incidents
of
judicial
review
from
six
months
to
two
years.
when
the
last
big
card
was
laid
in
the
table
in
october
1965,
when
the
norfolk
and
western
and
c
&
o
filed
to
the
commission
an
application
for
approval
of
their
merger.
that
would
be
the
nor
--
the
old
norfolk
--
with
the
norfol
and
western-nickel
plate
plus
the
c
&
o
and
b
&
o
combination
into
a
single
system.
and
they
offered
to
include
on
specified
terms
which
have
not
yet
been
accepted,
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine,
the
reading,
and
the
central
new
jersey,
all
of
the
orphans.
of
course
it
was
subject
to
significant
conditions
--
qualifications.
one,
being
modification
of
present
federal
tax
law
to
permit
norfolk
and
western
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
operating
laws
carry
overs
of
the
erie-lackawanna,
boston
and
maine,
reading
and
central
new
jersey.
now
those
would
have
a
tax
value
of
something
in
the
dimension
of
a
$100
million
or
more.
so
you
can
see
that
while
this
latest
merger
plan
which
would
include
all
five
of
the
so-called
orphan
lines
were
considerably
it
maybe
found
that
be
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
still
a
very
complicated
transaction
and
the
date
that
it
could
be
put
it
into
effect
even
if
the
level
of
commission
decision
to
say
nothing
of
court
review.
there's
an
imponderable
period.
we
may
be
talking
about
two
years.
we
may
be
talking
about
five.
finally,
returning
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
contentions
of
ches
--
of
chicago
and
eastern
illinois,
i
call
the
attention
that
in
february
of
this
year,
february
of
1965.
the
commission
authorized
missouri
pacific
to
acquire
stock
control
of
appellant
c
&
e
i
upon
condition
that
mopac
and
c
&
e
i
negotiate
with
the
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
with
the
latter
to
operate
over
c
&
e
i,
chicago
to
evansville
branch
subject
to
the
subsequent
approval
of
the
commission.
commission's
order
was
sustained
by
a
three-judge
court
and
it
was
affirmed
today
by
this
court.
so
c
&
e
i
apparently
or
that
one
can
tell
is
on
its
way
to
inclusion
in
the
considerably
larger
missouri
pacific
system.
in
march
1962,
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
file
their
merger
application
to
the
commission
and
there
followed
extensive
hearings,
a
129
days
of
hearings
in
a
large
number
of
cities
for
the
convenience
of
witnesses.
and
it's
important
to
note
the
role
these
present
appellants
to
plead
in
that
litigation
and
some
of
the
appellees.
the
trustees
of
the
new
haven
in
the
reorganization
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
participated
actively
and
urged
that
approval
of
any
merger
be
conditioned
upon
the
inclusion
of
new
haven
pursuant
to
the
inclusion
of
the
section
5
(2)
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
they
contented
that
continuance
of
new
haven's
vital
services
in
southern
new
england
could
be
insured
only
by
inclusion
in
a
larger
rail
system
and
this
was
the
only
possibility
for
inclusion
which
they
could
see.
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine,
they
participated
actively.
asserting
that
as
independent
carriers
they
couldn't
withstand
the
enhanced
competition
that
would
result
from
a
merged
penn-central
and
so
there,
except
the
merger
be
disapprove
if
they
could
not
be
included
in
the
larger
system.
and
specifically
they
asked
the
commission
provide
to
their
subsequent
inclusion
of
the
penn-central
merger
for
their
inclusion
of
them
in
a
penn-central
merger
in
the
event
they
were
unable
to
obtain
inclusion
of
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
now,
turning
to
the
others
now
before
the
court,
norfolk
and
western
did
not
participate
in
the
hearing
or
otherwise
until
they
filed
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
now,
we
are
told
that
that
was
because
they
were
under
pennsylvania
control.
alright,
i'll
accept
that.
when
they
filed
this
petition
for
reconsideration,
they
were
not
under
pennsylvania
control
and
the
petition
for
reconsideration
simply
did
not
asked
the
commission
for
the
relief
they
are
now
seeking
from
the
court.
chesapeake
in
ohio,
baltimore
in
ohio
and
ready
intervened
their
request
that
they
offered
no
evidence
in
opposition
to
the
merger
or
to
the
effects
of
the
inclusion
of
new
haven,
erie-lackawanna,
boston
and
maine,
delaware
and
hudson.
william
and
mary
--
western
maryland
participated
and
presented
evidence
in
a
specific
competitive
angle
which
is
no
longer
involved
in
the
litigation.
central
new
jersey
did
not
petition
at
least
to
intervene
in
the
proceedings
until
after
they
closed
the
hearing.
the
city
of
scranton
offered
only
a
single
witness.
the
purport
of
whose
prepared
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
erie-lackawanna
was
of
vital
importance
to
that
locality.
no
brief
was
filed
to
the
hearing
examiner
by
scranton.
shapp
testified
and
introduced
an
exhibit
in
opposition
to
the
merger.
the
railway
labor
executive
association
withdrew
its
opposition
to
the
merger
after
the
applicants
had
entered
into
an
agreement
for
the
protection
of
employees
through
attrition.
generally
speaking
under
attrition,
nobody
looses
his
job
unless
he
dies
or
retires.
there
are
other
qualifications
to
it.
but
it
roughly
--
its
employees
are
adversely
affected
only
through
attrition.
so
labor
is
out
of
the
case.
and
the
department
of
justice
strongly
opposed
the
merger
both
in
hearing
and
on
brief.
the
commission
in
its
final
report
issued
after
exceptions
the
examiner's
report
and
oral
argument.
the
commission
adopted
as
its
own,
the
report
of
the
hearing
officers
except
as
otherwise
indicated.
so
that
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
consists
not
merely
of
this
document
but
of
the
larger
a
--
but
by
the
larger
examiner's
report,
copies
of
which
have
been
made
available
to
the
court.
the
commission's
unanimous
conclusion
that
penn-central
merger
appropriately
conditioned
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
is
supported
by
such
basic
findings
as
these,
that
during
the
period
1960
and
1964,
penn
and
central
could
not
make
a
profit
out
of
transportation
operations.
the
annual
savings
from
the
merger
will
exceed
$80
million
after
eight
years.
and
the
merger
with
and
because
of
its
resulting
savings
will
result
and
substantially
improve
transportation
service
to
a
large
shipping
public.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
in
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
that
was
put
to
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
commission's
reaction
was
we
are
not
going
to
assume
from
the
short
period
of
time
that
our
earlier
finding
based
upon
a
longer
period
should
be
scrapped.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
i
think
they
could
have.
yes,
a
very
broad
discretion
under
section
5
as
to
whether
to
approve
or
disapprove.
i
have
no
doubt
if
the
commission
could
have
changed
this
one.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
it
didn't,
it
refused
to
change
his
mind.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
petition
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
are
unwilling
to
avail
--
were
unwilling
to
assume
that
the
business
that
they'll
be
no
further
business
cycle
and
that
penn-central
earnings
were
going
to
continue
indefinitely
to
the
1965,
1966
(inaudible)
and
we
have
already
seen
slight
intonations
that
perhaps
the
commission
wasn't
justified
in
its
skepticism.
as
to
the
service
improvements,
they
were
described
better
than
i
can
do
it,
in
the
petition
for
reconsideration
filed
by
c
&
o,
b
&
o.
they
said,
a
merged
penn-central
will
generate
large
savings
and
touch
off
a
significant
drive
to
the
type
of
broad
gauge
service
improvements
which
is
the
very
purpose
of
the
merger.
there
will
be
funds
available
for
the
acquisitions
of
additional
equipment
including
special
equipments
and
so
on.
c
&
o,
b
&
o
believed
that
basically
the
merger
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
notwithstanding
this
substantial
adverse
effect
that
will
have
on
our
traffic
and
revenues.
now
of
course
the
merger
will
produce
better
service
to
the
public.
that's
where
its
for
--
that
where
produces
is
competitive
bite.
therell
be
more
to
the
merger
than
many
adjust
the
internal
savings.
it
will
produce
better
service
and
that's
why
all
these
appellant
carriers
are
in
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
it
produces
much
more
single
line
movements.
and
in
this
merger,
what
is
going
to
take
place
although
shapp
complains
of
it,
there
will
be
a
concentration
of
track
and
the
longer
and
heavier
trains.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
all
you
--
or
you
--
all
you
can
think
of
really
is
just
traffic
in
one
particular
area.
but
it
--
it
is
true
that
here.
there'll
be
a
concentration
of
traffic
from
certain
areas
over
new
york
central's
water
level
route.
now,
its
not
just
shifting
of
traffic,
it's
the
fact
that's
its
concentrated
into
longer
and
heavier
trains
that
produces
very
large
operating
economies
and
faster
service
in
many,
many
cases.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
one
minute?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
true
or
not
your
honor.
i
know
--
i
do
know
that
this
is
--
this
is
about
the
only
country
in
the
world
where
that
has
not
happen.
that
this
is
the
--
that
we
have
--
what
we
have
the
only
privately
owned
railroad
system
in
the
world
operating
with
the
considerable
degree
of
competition,
paying
heavy
taxes
and
so
on,
and
many,
many
people
believe.
and
is
reflected
this
commission's
decision
that
is
the
right
type
of
rail
merger
are
necessary
to
keep
our
system
going
the
way
we
want
it
and
indeed
to
improve
it.
the
right
type
of
merger
is
necessary
to
not
only
keep
the
kind
of
railroad
service
we
have
but
to
improve.
as
to
the
new
haven,
the
commission
found
that
its
services
were
essential
to
the
public
and
that
new
haven
not
only
had
no
other
place
to
got
than
in
a
larger
rail
line
but
that
it
would
be
injured
by
a
merged
penn-central.
so
the
commission
imposed
as
a
condition
subsequent
to
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
that
all
of
new
haven's
operations
freight
and
passenger
be
included.
of
course
the
terms
with
inclusion
will
be
subject
to
this
further
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
to
the
approval
of
bankruptcy
court.
as
to
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine,
the
commission
noted
that
it
had
reserved
an
opportunity
for
their
inclusion
for
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
at
the
same,
the
commission
recognized
that
the
very
savings
an
improved
service
which
would
justify
finding
a
penn-central
merger
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
it
meant
that
a
substantial
amount
of
traffic
could
be
diverted
from
penn
--
from
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine
and
erie-lackawanna.
so
it
did
two
things.
first,
it
provided
a
second
opportunity
for
inclusion
of
those
three
lines
in
a
major
system.
what
provided
that
if
the
applicant
--
if
the
petitioner
one
of
them
for
inclusion
in
norfolk
and
western
was
denied
then
it
could
apply
for
inclusion
in
the
penn-central
system
and
the
commission
reserved
jurisdiction
to
require
its
inclusion
on
the
prescribed
terms?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
have
several
opportunities.
i'd
be
glad
to
divert
very
briefly.
they
now
say
that
the
reason
they
didn't
show
up
in
the
hearing
before
the
commission
was
that
they
didn't
know
that
new
haven
was
going
to
be
included
in
the
merger.
now,
that
won't
hold
up.
new
haven's
application
for
inclusion
in
penn-central
was
widely
and
publicly
supported,
noisily
supported
by
all
the
public
bodies
to
northeast.
and
for
anyone
to
assume,
for
any
railroad
management
to
assume
that
new
haven
would
not
be
included
merely
because
penn-central
said
they
didn't
want
to
be
included
was
simply
naive.
anyway
in
authorizing
new
haven's
into
--
in
requiring
new
haven's
inclusion,
commission
has
provided
that
in
this
hearing
which
was
--
which
starts
in
january
on
the
terms
of
new
haven
inclusion,
central
new
jersey
and
reading
can
have
an
opportunity
to
testify,
to
be
heard
on
what
condition
should
attest
to
the
new
haven
inclusion
to
protect
their
roots
with
new
haven.
now,
as
you
--
of
course
you
also
have
been
told
that
this
new
haven
inclusion
isn't
going
to
happen
tonight.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
is
not
going
to
happen
overnight.
it'll
be
a
good
two
years
everybody
now
that
raised
there
can
be
an
actual
inclusion
of
new
haven
and
before
central
new
jersey
could
feel
this
anticipated
injury.
central
new
jersey
also
says
they
didn't
know
that
the
commission
was
going
to
reserve
jurisdiction
to
require
pennsylvania,
to
give
traffic
rights
to
delaware
and
hudson
over
a
stretch
between
wilkes-barre
and
hagerstown.
that's
just
a
second
string
to
the
bow
which
the
commission
has
reserved
to
provide
delaware
and
hudson
with
the
physical
connection
with
norfolk
and
western.
it
may
never
occur.
in
any
event,
if
it
does,
it
will
be
only
after
a
further
opportunity
before
the
commission
and
central
new
jersey
can
be
heard
on
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
seems
to
be.
there
is
another
which
i
do
not
specifically
recall
and
that
too
would
be
--
is
the
--
would
be
the
subject
of
a
further
hearing
before
it
took
place.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
these
interim
protected
conditions.
they
complained
about
the
impact
of
the
interim
protective
conditions
your
honor
and
they
have
--
and
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
they
had
their
opportunity
each
of
them
--
to
call
them
in.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
believe
they
were.
i
believe
they
were
present
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
they
were
there
and
they
presented
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
they'll
have
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
as
to
--
effect
of
a
new
haven
inclusion
upon
them
in
the
very
near
future.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
these
appellants
filed
a
various
petitions
for
reconsideration
in
the
commission's
report
and
order.
i
would
like
to
refer
a
layer
to
the
extent
that
which
their
petitions
did
not
raised
the
contentions
which
they
now
present
to
the
courts.
but
for
present
purposes,
it
should
be
noted
that
all
of
the
railroad
appellants
requested
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
the
admittedly
noble
interim
protective
conditions.
so
on
the
commission's
report
on
reconsideration
september
1966,
the
commission
did
two
things.
it
reopened
the
proceedings
for
further
hearings
limited
to
this
special
traffic
and
indemnity
provisions
in
appendix
g.
it
provided
that
the
traffic
conditions
would
remain
in
effect
assuming
a
consummation
until
change
after
hearing.
it
rescinded
the
indemnity
condition
but
provided
that
any
indemnity
provision
which
might
be
devised
would
be
imposed
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
at
the
same
time,
notwithstanding
its
action
in
reopening
the
proceeding
for
further
hearing
on
the
traffic
and
indemnity
conditions,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
public
interest
requires
prompt
consummation
of
the
proposed
merger.
now,
the
complaints
have
been
filed
in
the
court
below
before
the
commission
had
issues
report
on
reconsideration
and
with
that
report
issued,
the
principal
issue
and
the
view
of
the
court
below
was
whether
the
commission
had
authorized
in
erring
cons
--
in
authorizing
consummation
of
the
merger
while
conducting
these
further
hearings
on
special
commissions.
in
a
detailed
analysis,
the
court
below
held
that
the
commission
had
not
heard.
secondarily,
although
little
argued
in
the
court
below,
the
court
below
held
that
was
no
merit
in
contentions
that
consummation
of
the
merger
should
be
deferred
until
conclusion
of
all
pending
rail
merger
proceedings
relating
to
the
northeastern
united
states.
turning
to
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice,
they
tell
the
court
that
the
agencies
are
the
executive
branch
that
had
substantive
responsibilities
for
the
formulation
of
economic
and
transportation
policies,
believe
that
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that
its
consummation
should
be
promptly
affected.
they
point
out
that
the
railroad
industry
of
the
northeast
is
an
urgent
need
of
rapid
modernization
and
believe
that
as
a
practical
matter,
substantial
consolidation
among
existing
systems
will
be
necessary
to
achieve
this
end.
thus,
those
federal
agencies
enjoin
the
states
of
pennsylvania,
new
york,
connecticut,
rhode
island,
and
massachusetts
in
supporting
this
merger.
it
is
unprecedented
support
for
such
a
transaction
by
public
bodies
responsible
to
the
welfare
of
the
large
segments
of
the
country.
it
is
clear
that
the
department
is
urging
delay
and
consummation
until
the
commission
determines
the
inclusion
petitions
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
for
inclusion
of
norfolk
and
western.
we
have
been
uncertain,
i
still
am,
as
to
whether
they
are
also
urging
delay
until
the
commission
determines
the
norfolk
and
western,
c
&
o
merger
application
and
the
precise
terms
and
until
it
determines
the
precise
terms
for
the
inclusion
of
new
haven.
because
that
the
more
of
those
things
you
will
put
in
as
a
bar
to
consummation,
the
more
we
are
talking
about
years.
just
the
--
not
just
the
few
friendly
months,
we're
talking
about
years.
in
any
event
at
that
point
the
department
says,
“this
court
should
not
now
decide
whether
the
commission
and
the
court
below
were
in
error”.
there
is
just
at
this
commission
hold
the
case
while
the
commission
completes
the
related
proceedings
so
that
this
court
won't
have
to
decide,
the
case
now
before
the
court.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
i
--
they
requested
really
which
ask
this
court
to
simply
stay
consummation
on
the
merger
without
determining
whether
the
court
below
erred
in
refusing
it
to
do
so.
but
at
that
point,
the
court
is
asking
--
the
department
is
asking
this
court
to
engage
in
the
administrative
and
non-judicial
function
of
regulating
the
commission's
docket.
so
that
the
things
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
court
should
not
do.
we
submit
that
the
commission
and
the
many
parties
and
indeed
the
court
below
are
entitled
to
a
decision.
and
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
particularly
in
the
reply
briefs
that
the
railroad
appellants
in
number
642,
norfolk
and
western
et
al.
and
the
central
new
jersey
in
its
reply
brief,
although
it
had
the
original
brief
are
now
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
approval
and
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
must
be
deferred
until
a
solution
is
found
for
all
the
lines
in
the
east.
we
submit
that
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
the
interim
protective
conditions?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
commissioner
--
the
commission
has
completed
this
hearing
in
those.
the
briefing
process
will
be
completed
by
february
6.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
like
to
be
careful
on
these
matters
particularly
in
--
i
like
to
be
very
careful
in
expressing
an
opinion
on
this
matter.
but
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
commission
could
finally
determine
those
protective
conditions
not
later
than
the
first
of
june.
possibly
earlier
but
i
would
not
want
to
express
an
earlier
date
not
later
in
the
first
of
june
in
my
judgment.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
have
to
answer
to
that
in
two
ways.
that's
just
the
administrative
process.
now,
certainly
the
whole
posture
of
this
litigation
strongly
suggests
that
no
matter
what
the
commission
proscribes,
one
--
one
of
these
carrier
factions
will
take
it
to
court.
so
the
next
question
will
be
to
the
merger
be
--
accept
consummation
be
further
deferred
until
judicial
review
of
the
interim
protected
conditions.
then
secondly,
that's
only
the
first
half
of
the
court
ruling.
they
say,
that
the
consummation
should
be
deferred
clearly
until
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine
is
settled
and
presumably
with
judicial
review
of
fact.
there
is
--
there's
just
no
way
we
--
anybody
can
be
sure
that
this
merger
could
possibly
go
into
--
that
this
--
that
the
delay
of
consummation
involved
in
differing
it
until
the
commission
comes
out
to
its
report
on
this
interim
special
conditions
would
involved
only
a
few
months.
it
depends
upon
what
happens
to
the
next
stage.
will
the
courts
--
will
the
courts
stay
up
further
pending
judicial
review
of
the
conditions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
the
reasons
given
by
the
rather
the
commission
boil
down
to
this.
it
had
found
that
the
merger
would
produce
improved
transportation
to
public
and
substantial
benefits
to
appellees,
$80
million
a
year
when
the
merger
is
fully
implemented.
secondarily,
it
had
found
that
that
inclusion
of
the
penn-central
merger
is
the
only
solution
that
anybody
has
really
proposed
for
continuance
of
new
haven
services.
and
the
commission
articulated
it
that
if
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger
is
deferred
for
several
years
or
indefinitely,
that
the
commission,
neither
the
commission
or
the
courts
can
it
--
can
have
any
assurance
that
it
will
ever
take
place
and
if
something
happens
that
it
doesn't
take
place,
nobody
has
any
solution
in
mind
for
continuation
of
new
haven's
services.
then
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
on
the
other
hand
the
commission
pointed
out,
that
we're
talking
about
the
interim
protection
now,
not
the
long
wage.
commission
pointed
out
that
putting
together
a
merger
of
this
size
is
a
vast
complex
and
slow
task.
for
example,
mr.
white
depressed
in
the
erie-lackawanna
in
speaking
with
the
further
authority
of
a
former
vice
president
of
new
york
central,
so
he
had
seen
both
side
of
this
competitive
relationship.
he
testified
to
the
commission
even
before
the
commission
had
announced
any
interim
protective
conditions
that
would
be
the
second
year
before
a
penn-central
merger
could
have
a
significant
impact
upon
erie-lackawanna,
that
it
would
have
no
effect
of
the
first
year
so
that
there
--
so
that
these
conditions
don't
have
to
be
affected
the
first
day
at
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
secondly,
penn-central
have
pledged
themselves
not
to
seek
judicial
review
of
the
appendix
g
conditions
which
the
commission
have
revised.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they'll
accept
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
the
--
as
to
the
appendix
g
conditions.
they
have
not
waived
judicial
review
on
capital
--
on
indemnity
for
capital
loss.
result
is
that
in
a
fairly
short
period
of
time,
certainly
this
spring
or
early
summer.
as
far
as
the
commission
and
penn-central
are
concerned,
a
set
of
protective
condition
can
be
in
effect.
now,
perhaps
others
can
go
to
court
and
get
them
stayed
that
as
far
as
the
applicants
and
the
commission
are
concerned,
there
will
be
a
set
of
conditions
in
effect
long
before
this
merger
could
have
a
real
competitive
bite.
secondly,
there
is
no
principle
of
law
that
anyone
of
these
appellant
railroads
has
to
be
guaranteed
100%
protection
against
diversion
of
traffic.
as
the
court
below
said,
what
they're
entitled
to
is
protection
against
such
diversion
of
traffic
as
will
impair
their
viability,
their
ability
to
provide
adequate
service
to
their
service
areas.
erie-lackawanna
has
testify
--
has
advised
the
commission
in
its
reply
brief,
in
the
inclusion
proceeding
that
it
is
confident
that
the
commission
can
device
reasonable
--
reasonably
adequate
protective
conditions.
now,
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
this
and
--
the
kind
of
indemnity
we're
talking
about,
interim
indemnity,
if
the
commission
should
prescribed
one.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
is
--
it
would
be
on
a
scale
the
only
fraction
of
the
merger
savings
because
the
indemnity
would
be
phrased
not
in
terms
of
a
reduction
in
gross
revenues
but
the
reduction
in
net
earnings.
and
we're
talking
about
a
sum
which
even
is
applied
to
all
three
railroads
would
be
a
few
million
dollars
a
year.
a
small
fraction
of
the
merger
savings
and
that's
why
penn-central
are
so
confident
of
that,
that's
why
they
committed
themselves
to
accept
the
--
any
temporary
indemnity
provision
that
they
know
what's
a
manageable
sum
that's
involved.
one
brief
point
sir,
the
norfolk
and
western
c
--
central
of
new
jersey
group
of
appellants,
c
&
o
and
b
&
o,
are
insist
--
have
been
urging
before
the
lower
court
and
this
court
that
any
kind
of
indemnity
provision
if
adopted
will
create
a
community
of
interest
between
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
on
the
one
hand
and
a
merged
penn-central
on
the
other
hand
which
will
cause
them
to
divert
traffic
to
each
other
and
away
from
norfolk
and
western,
c
&
j
and
so
on.
this
to
which
they
now
attach
which
they
view
as
such
great
alarm
was
not
even
mentioned
by
c
&
j
and
norfolk
and
western
in
their
petitions
for
reconsideration
to
the
commission.
from
which
i
conclude
and
it
was
barely
mentioned
by
c
&
o,
b
&
o
from
which
i
conclude
that
since
they
have
so
recently
foreseen
the
stature
that
it
must
be
one
with
which
the
commission
can
cope
in
the
formulation
of
conditions
after
a
hearing.
and
one
further
point
on
the
efficacy
of
these
conditions
to
protect
these
three
carriers
pending
consummation
of
this
merger
and
their
inclusion
in
another
system
and
this
might
--
frankly,
this
might
be
more
important
in
the
right
to
judicial
review.
they
will
be
subject
to
constant
revision
by
the
commission
on
the
light
experience
pursuant
to
section
5
(9)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
admittedly,
they're
noble
and
we
might
learn
quite
a
good
deal
by
experience
with
them
as
we
go
along.
and
the
commission
would
have
to
retain
jurisdiction
to
modify
those
conditions
to
ensure
that
they
give
adequate
protection
to
the
three
without
causing
undue
injury
to
the
others.
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
seriously,
the
other
issue
in
the
case.
it's
been
muted
today
but
it's
here
and
that
is
that
consummation
of
this
merger
should
be
deferred
not
merely
until
protected
conditions
are
prescribed
in
a
few
months
by
the
commission.
but
that
consummation
should
be
deferred
until
act
--
until
the
inclusion
of
the
three
protected
lines
and
is
finally
determined.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
resuming,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
contention
of
some
of
the
appellant
railroads
and
the
department
of
justice
that
consummation
of
a
penn-central
merger
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
be
permitted
until
every
small
line,
the
orphans
as
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
them
are
fitted
into
a
larger
rail
system.
the
court
below
held
and
we
submit
correctly
that
this
is
not
required.
of
course
it
would
be
the
ideal
decisional
situation,
but
it
just
doesn't
happen.
from
1920
until
1940,
congress
had
a
state
of
--
stated
objective,
the
consolidation
of
the
nation's
railroads
and
to
what
it
characterized
as
a
limited
number
of
rail
systems,
and
it
authorized
the
commission
to
approve
carrier
initiated
proposals
for
unification
which
were
consonant
with
this
pre-determined
plan
which
the
commission
was
to
draw
up.
this
court
recognized
in
its
decisions
in
schwabacher
and
in
st.
joe
paper
company
that
the
planned
approach
failed,
and
the
principal
reason
it
failed
was
that
the
commission
lacked
power
to
initiate
or
to
compel
mergers.
section
5
was
complete
--
completely
rewritten
in
1940.
this
court
has
noted
in
the
county
of
marin
case
that
the
end
of
congress,
its
objective
remained
the
same,
the
only
thing
that
changed
was
the
means.
under
the
present
section
5,
the
only
planning
or
coercive
power
which
the
commission
has
is
the
power
to
condition
its
approval
of
a
carrier
initiated
merger
by
requiring
the
inclusion
of
other
railroads
in
the
territory
if
they
petition
for
inclusion.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
commission
had
no
control
over
the
timing
of
c&o-b&o,
norfolk
and
western-nickel
plate,
penn-central
merger
applications.
it
had
no
control
over
erie-lackawanna's
withdrawal
of
its
original
petition
for
inclusion
in
norfolk
and
western,
a
withdrawal
to
improve
its
bargaining
position.
and
again
on
this
case,
the
court
had
--
the
commission
has
no
control
over
the
non-participation
in
its
hearing
of
the
railroad
appellants
in
642.
since
1940,
the
commissioners
authorized
to
approve
carrier
mergers
or
unifications
which
it
finds
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
upon
just
and
reasonable
terms.
here,
the
commission
approved
a
penn-central
merger
and
authorized
its
consummation,
while
reserving
jurisdiction
to
provide
opportunities
for
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine
and
norfolk
and
western
are
in
a
penn-central
system.
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
of
the
department
and
the
railroad
appellants
in
642
that
they
are
asking
that
consummation
of
penn-central
which
they,
along
with
the
northeastern
states
and
the
executive
--
and
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government,
generally
favor
as
being
in
the
public
interest.
they
ask
that
as
consummation
be
deferred
indefinitely
until
there
has
been
a
final
determination
by
the
commission
and
inevitably
they
mean
by
the
courts
of
the
faith
of
a
smaller
railroads
in
the
northeast.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
think
that
question
is
in
the
case
before
your
honors
but
i
think
that's
a
separate
question.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
guess
pretty
yes.
i'm
addressing
myself
now
to
broader
confession
which
is
involved
in
the
case
and
which
was
ruled
on
by
the
court
below.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
means
under
their
contention,
deferment
of
consummation
until
determination
of
the
newly
proposed
n&w-c&o
dereco
plan
and
look
what's
involved
there.
after
hearing
that
might
be
that
the
commission
can
fix
terms
for
the
inclusion
in
that
system
if
it
approves
it,
of
norfolk
and
western
of
central
of
new
jersey
and
reading,
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
boston
and
maine.
but
it
cannot
compel
anyone
of
those
small
lines
to
accept
those
terms.
and
indeed
if
norfolk
and
western
c&o
don't
like
the
terms,
they
can
decline
to
go
ahead
with
their
merger
or
they
may
litigate
the
terms.
in
effect
it
forced
the
commission
into
the
discarded
planning
approach
of
1920
and
still
without
the
powers
of
coercion
which
underlying
to
the
failure
of
the
1920
planning
approach.
the
practical
point
is
that
if
--
that
proceedings
either
to
determine
the
inclusion
of
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
and
boston
and
maine
into
the
present
norfolk
and
western
system
or
under
their
--
and
to
their
broader
proposed
system
with
the
dereco
plan,
with
court
proceedings,
the
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings
were
talking
about
delay,
not
measured
in
months,
but
in
terms
of
years,
three,
four
or
five
years.
and
we
submit
that
the
commission
in
its
report
on
reconsideration
was
wholly
realistic
in
concluding
that
if
the
penn-central
merger
with
a
substantially
unchallenged
major
public
benefits
is
not
--
is
differed
for
that
longer
period,
there
can
be
no
assurance
that
it
will
ever
take
place.
we
point
out
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
determination
of
the
interim
protective
conditions?
yes,
as
i
stated
yesterday,
i
am
fairly
confident
that
the
commission's
report
determining
those
after
the
hearing
those
interim
protective
conditions
will
be
out
by
june
1.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
cannot
predict
what
would
happen
in
the
courts
after
that.
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
from
the
present
posture
of
this
--
the
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct.
the
applicants
penn-central
have
down
themselves
to
accept
without
judicial
review
the
traffic
and
temporary
indemnity
provisions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
other
side
is
free
to
seek
judicial
review
but
stays
pending
appeal
--
all
of
the
other
time
possibilities
that
are
available.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
i
didn't
but
i
may
say
that
the
lowest
estimate
that
i
have
heard
of
the
time
involved
to
bring
about
actual
inclusion
of
new
haven
is
two
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct
and
i
don't
like
to
candid.
that
might
be
a
conservative
estimate.
it
would
certainly
be
a
record
performance
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
essentially,
it
consists
of
a
sale
of
assets.
all
assets
are
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
plan
applied
to
the
proceeds.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
determining
the
price
--
what
is
a
fair
and
adequate
price.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
this
has
been
a
marvelously
expedited
procedure
which
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
case
comes
up
in
a
remarkable
posture
your
honor.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
serious
attack
on
the
merits
of
the
merger
and
that's
why
the
huge
record
in
this
proceeding,
the
huge
evidentiary
record
in
this
proceeding
has
not
been
filed
with
the
courts
by
any
party.
now
when
we
get
into
new
haven,
valuation
proceeding
essentially,
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
if
the
creditor
hoops,
“let
us
get
by
that
lightly.”
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
more
authoritative
estimate
on
my
own.
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
estimated
that
it
would
be
to
the
end
of
1967
at
the
best.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
six
months
from
then
and
a
year
from
now.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
was
unwilling
to
exceed
the
request
for
consummation
for
merger
for
two
reasons.
the
merits
of
the
merger
almost
uniquely
were
not
being
challenged.
there
was
no
challenge,
essentially
no
challenge
to
each
findings
as
to
the
substantial
service
improvements
which
would
result
for
large
segments
of
the
shipping
public
and
to
the
almost
incredible
annual
savings
of
$80
million
a
year
which
the
carriers
can
achieve.
in
addition,
the
commission
sought
consummation
of
a
penn-central
merger
as
the
only
solution
for
the
continuance
of
new
haven's
transportation
services.
no
one
has
proposed
a
new
haven
solution
other
than
inclusion
in
this
merger.
under
the
statute,
the
commission
cannot,
it
has
no
power
to
require
penn
or
central
or
any
other
carrier
separately
to
take
on
any
of
new
haven's
operations.
its
only
power
is
under
5(2)(d)
to
require
inclusion
of
new
haven
as
a
condition
to
approval
of
this
merger.
this
is
the
only
solution
for
new
haven.
in
contrast,
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson,
and
boston
and
maine,
they
have
in
sight
several
possibilities.
inclusion
in
penn-central
is
the
only
possibility
for
new
haven.
