mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
howard
trienens.
this
is
the
penn-central
merger
case.
it's
probably
the
biggest
corporate
merger
ever.
the
cases
before
this
court
on
appeals
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
denying
injunctive
relief
against
an
order
of
interstate
commerce
commission
which
would
permit
immediate
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger.
i
stress
immediate
because
by
the
very
nature
of
the
commission's
action
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
commission's
order
and
on
appeal,
the
lawfulness
of
the
commission's
order
permitting
immediate
consummation
was
necessarily
before
the
court
even
though
the
matter
arose
on
applications
for
interlocutory
injunction.
now,
basically
this
case
arose
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
that
act
enabled
the
commission
to
approve
an
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
merger
transactions
which
are
found
to
be
as
conditioned
by
the
commission
or
found
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
problem
here
and
the
problem
i
will
develop
through
these
rather
laborious
facts
is
that
no
one
can
know
today
whether
this
merger
transaction
as
conditioned
is
or
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
the
reason
you
can't
know
is
because
you
don't
know
the
conditions.
you
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
transaction
this
is
yet.
the
commission
has
found
that
certain
conditions
are
essential
that
the
certain
conditions
must
be
attached.
they
have
not
been
found
either
for
the
long
term
or
the
short
term.
now
realistically,
we
believe
that
until
those
conditions
are
found
and
passed
upon
no
one
can
know
what
the
future
of
competitive
rail
transportation
in
the
east
will
be.
on
stating
the
facts,
the
first
and
dominant
fact
is
the
penn
and
central
today
had
half
the
railroad
business
in
the
east.
the
figures
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
inserted
in
the
end
of
our
brief
a
series
of
maps
showing
the
proposed
penn-central
system
and
showing
the
remaining
roads
and
the
question
that
has
dominated
the
commission
proceedings,
the
question
before
this
court
is
how
the
other
half
of
the
east
is
going
to
live
in
the
face
of
penn-central.
of
the
hearings
before
the
commission,
penn
and
central
showed
that
they
would
create
a
territory-wide
single
line
service
serving
all
major
ports,
all
major
gateways
and
as
a
single
line
railroad
throughout
the
east
they
would
provide
great
operative
savings
and
great
improvements
in
service.
a
single
line
service
has
great
advantage.
single
line
service
saves
money
but
it
also
improved
service.
and
the
commission
relying
on
those
improvements
in
service
and
efficiencies
found
at
this
merger
was
in
the
public
interest
notwithstanding
the
diminution
of
competition.
but
these
very
same
service
improvements
are
the
things
that
caused
the
problem
for
the
other
eastern
roads
and
raised
the
questions
of
how
they
are
going
to
live
in
the
face
of
this
penn-central
system.
now,
following
the
hearings
before
the
commission,
the
examiners
found
that
these
improvements
would
occur.
they
also
found
that
the
merger
was
necessary
because
of
the
survival,
save
and
enable
to
survive
the
penn
and
central
companies
because
of
the
failing
company
doctrine
specifically
in
those
terms,
the
east
was
a
failing
industry.
now
the
examiners
recognized
that
when
you
put
penn
and
central
together
they
would
cause
shifts
in
the
traffic
patterns.
they
would
attract
traffic.
but
the
examiners
felt
and
found
that
the
other
half
of
these
could
live
because
by
cooperating
among
themselves
they
could
attract
and
meet
penn-central.
now
with
the
other
half
of
the
east
by
working
together
could
offset
these
shifts
in
traffic
that
would
attract
traffic
to
penn-central.
as
to
new
haven
they
didn't
find
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
can't
answer
that
specifically,
i
know
it
anticipated
some
additional
mergers.
i
think
it
contemplated
putting
some
of
the
roads
in
at
least
some
of
the
other
systems
but
the
exact
form
of
the
restructuring
that
was
contemplated
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
examine
report.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
had
gotten
together
at
the
stage
of
the
commission's
decision.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
the
n
&
w-nickel
plate
was
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
had
gotten
together.
now,
the
important
point
and
it's
expressed
greatly
by
the
counsel
for
the
commission
in
their
brief
at
page
48
where
they
find
or
state
that
b
&
o-c
&
o
was
permitted
to
go
ahead
on
a
specific
finding
that
it
would
not
have
any
adverse
effect
on
any
other
eastern
railroad.
n
&
w-nickel
plate
was
permitted
to
go
ahead
as
commission
counsel
frankly
state
because
it
would
have
no
material
adverse
effect
on
any
other
railroad
in
the
area.
and
in
fact,
in
n
&
w-nickel
plate
they
found
that
that
merger
would
help
of
the
railroads
and
yet
to
bear
in
mind
that
putting
together
n
&
w-nickel
plate
for
example,
put
together
a
railroad
almost
as
big
but
not
quite
as
big
as
penn
alone
already
was.
that's
why
with
its
rather
narrower
geographic
cover,
it
didn't
raise
the
problems
the
penn-central
raises.
now
that
--
the
end
of
the
hearing
stage,
after
the
hearing
stage
that
norfolk
and
western
which
had
been
enabled
the
merger
with
nickel
plate
was
set
free
as
a
part
of
that
merger.
it
was
set
free
of
control
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
up
to
that
point,
pennsylvania
controlled
n
&
w.
what
n
&
w
is
today,
penn-central
wield
it.
it
was
part
of
the
three-system
plan,
part
of
the
penn-central's
plan
for
how
to
carve
up
the
east.
and
it
was
after
the
hearing
stage,
after
the
examiner
had
found
that
the
way
to
meet
penn-central's
for
the
other
half
to
get
together
that
n
&
w
and
c
&
o
proposed
that
there
be
hearings
as
to
whether
a
merger
was
the
way
they
should
get
together.
that
proposal
--
application
has
been
filed.
the
hearings
been
held
up
for
a
year
or
so
but
it's
now
been
set
for
this
winter,
this
spring.
oh,
by
the
time
this
case
reached
the
commission
level,
this
was
a
very
different
case.
the
survival
problem,
the
failing
company
doctrine
was
out
of
it.
penn-central
which
between
them
had
earned
$7
million
in
1961,
that
earned
$122
million
in
1965.
in
1966,
their
estimate
is
$150
million
of
net
income
and
that's
before
reflecting
any
merger
savings
or
other
merger
benefits.
the
commission
did
not
and
it
could
not
find
that
this
merger
was
essential
to
the
survival
of
penn
or
central.
the
commission's
theory
in
its
april
6th
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
was
total
net
income
of
the
corporations
that
are
being
merged,
whole
net
income.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
addressed
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
addressed
--
well,
he
mention
both
in
its
reports,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
net
railway
operating
income
which
is
the
--
i
can't
answer
that
because
you
have
to
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
believe
it
is
sir
for
this
reason.
if
you're
talking
about
the
total
financial
strength
of
the
two
enterprises
that
are
going
to
be
put
together,
the
stock
that's
going
to
be
exchanged,
the
financial
strength
of
the
enterprise,
you
talk
about
what
those
enterprises
earn.
i
agree
that
if
you
are
talking
about
the
earnings
from
competitive
rail
service
that
the
rate
of
return
on
rail
service
is
important
in
financial
strength.
however,
if
you're
talking
about
their
strength
as
competitors,
it's
how
much
of
the
market
they
have.
how
many
shoes
they
had
in
brown
shoe,
how
many
grocery
sales
they
had
in
(inaudible)
grocery.
and
if
that
--
that's
the
reason
i
give
the
figures
measuring
the
amount
of
business
they
have
in
the
competitive
rail
area.
it's
true
that
pennsylvania
has
vast
interest
outside
the
railroad
business.
it's
true
that
n
&
w
has
considered
on
a
coal
traffic
it's
not
rail
competitor
to
anybody.
it's
in
the
competitive
area.
you
look
at
the
competitive
market
shares
and
if
you're
looking
at
the
total
corporations,
those
of
the
dollar
figures
i
gave,
the
total
earnings
of
the
company.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
penn
and
central
aren't
in
taxes
so
it's
no
difference
to
them
at
the
moment.
now,
the
commission
as
i
say
did
not
rely
on
this
survival
problem,
this
failing
company
doctrine.
the
commission
recognized
that
these
service
improvements
would
occur
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
railroad
earnings
at
a
higher
level.
and
they
approved
the
merger
as
outweighing
the
diminution
of
competition.
now,
with
respect
to
three
railroads
however,
the
commission
found
that
this
penn-central
merger
would
destroy
them.
this
is
what
distinguishes
penn-central.
we
have
a
finding
that
this
merger
would
destroy
at
least
three
of
the
railroads
not
coming
to
new
haven.
i
like
to
read
two
sentences
that
are
the
key
for
the
commission's
analysis.
they
first
found
that
unless
somehow
protected
these
three
railroads
would
be
adversely
affected
by
the
proposed
merger
to
a
serious
degree
and
would
be
severely
handicapped
in
providing
the
required
transportation
service.
now
the
commission
then
concluded
that
it
is
doubtful
that
without
inclusion
in
a
major
system,
these
three
carriers
could
withstand
the
competition
of
the
applicant's
merge.
and
unless
they
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
their
future,
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
at
this
time
even
though
approving
the
merger.
nor
was
the
commission
drew
the
line
between
when
you
authorized
consummation
and
approval
of
the
merger.
and
they
found
that
we
will
let
penn-central
go
ahead
right
away
even
though
we
haven't
found
a
home
for
these
railroads.
and
why
because
we
have
worked
out
some
specific
traffic
and
indemnity
conditions
and
they
further
set
our
approval
for
merger,
for
underlayed
consummation
shall
be
subject
to
the
conditions
specifically
determined
by
us.
however,
now
we're
--
they
said
we're
going
to
let
it
go
through
before
we
found
the
home
for
these
roads
but
we're
going
to
work
out
something
in
the
interim
and
are
letting
it
--
this
merger
go
through
now
is
subject
to
those
specific
protected
conditions.
now,
what
were
those
conditions?
there
are
two
kinds,
one
of
the
traffic
conditions
which
were
designed
to
freeze
and
tie
up
penn-central
in
their
actual
improvement
of
service
so
if
they
just
couldn't
improve
service
and
couldn't
attract
traffic.
now
that
doesn't
do
the
job
even
if
you
froze
penn-central
solid,
that
doesn't
do
the
job
because
the
very
fact
of
putting
them
together
eliminating
competition
between
them
causes
a
diversion
of
traffic
from
these
other
railroads
so
--
and
the
commission
didn't
stop
with
the
traffic
conditions.
it
went
on
to
these
so-called
indemnity
conditions.
indemnity
conditions
and
that's
a
misnomer.
these
aren't
indemnities
for
loss.
this
is
a
revenue
sharing
pool.
there's
a
formula
where
you
put
penn
and
central
and
erie's
money
together
and
they
get
earnings
out
of
it
as
a
share
of
that.
erie
is
guaranteed
share.
now,
these
conditions
were
critical
to
the
commission's
decision.
they
were
noble.
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
them
before,
there
was
no
hearing
on
them.
they
came
out
of
the
blue.
well
after
this
commission
hearing,
the
protected
carriers,
these
three
protected
carriers,
they
asked
for
reconsideration.
they
asked
reconsideration
on
the
grounds
that
these
conditions
were
wholly
inadequate.
the
unprotected
carriers
who'd
been
counting
on
the
cooperation
of
everybody
outside
penn-central
were
suddenly
for
--
faced
with
the
problem
that
there
was
a
pool,
a
community
of
interest
created
where
three
of
these
roads
were
going
to
be
open
to
penn-central
orbit
at
least
temporarily.
so
both
the
protected
and
the
unprotected
carriers
asked
for
reconsiderations.
the
appellants,
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
also
asked
for
reconsideration.
the
commission
had
dismissed
its
claim
on
the
ground
that,
"oh
well,
c
&
e
i
will
have
an
offsetting
benefit
of
intensified
competition
between
its
connecting
carriers
in
penn,
one
of
the
connecting
carriers
being
erie.
there's
no
recognition
of
the
effect
of
this
revenue
pool
on
what
happens
to
erie's
competition.
now,
c
&
e
i,
the
commission
also
passed
off
its
problem
by
saying,
"oh,
c
&
e
i
can
provide
superior
service
in
that
area".
no
evidence
to
support
that
nor
there
is
any
evidence
that
a
possible
control
of
another
railroad
of
c
&
e
i
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
impact
to
penn-central
on
c
&
e
i.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
it's
to
st.
louis
and
then
to
louisville.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
from
chicago.
now,
these
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
decided
by
the
commission
in
the
so-called
september
16th
report
and
that
report
is
what
created
the
basic
issue
before
this
court.
because
that
report
undercut
the
whole
premise
of
the
basis
on
which
they
left
the
merger
consummated
immediately
in
april.
the
commission
first
acknowledged
the
valid
issues
that
have
been
raised
with
respect
to
these
new
conditions
and
they
acknowledged
further
that
as
to
the
unprotected
carriers
they
never
had
a
hearing
on
its
--
from
the
impact
of
these
conditions
on
them.
instead
of
deciding
these
matters,
having
a
hearing
raised
--
correcting
the
conditions,
giving
a
hearing
to
the
unprotected
carriers
as
to
what
these
all
did
to
them.
the
commission
let
penn-central
go
through
anyway.
it
rescinded
the
indemnity
conditions.
it
set
a
hearing
on
whether
there
should
be
any
indemnity
conditions
and
authorized
retroactive
reinstatement
that
a
hearing
on
what
the
traffic
conditions
ought
to
be
because
nobody
knew
by
that
time
what
they
meant.
but
it
permitted
immediate
consummation
to
penn-central
anyway.
and
it
didn't
even
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
cannot
answer
that
and
i
don't
--
and
i
want
to
answer
it
in
this
way
mr.
chief
justice.
we
cannot
answer
that
because
we
do
not
know
what
penn-central
is.
now
as
i'll
get
to,
we
don't
know
whether
penn-central
means
a
monopoly
of
new
england.
in
that
case,
we
might
be
against
it.
if
it
means
balanced
competition
with
another
system
or
other
systems,
we'd
be
for
it.
we
just
don't
know
because
we
don't
know
what
kind
of
an
animal
penn-central
is
until
we
know
what
the
conditions
are.
we
just
don't
know.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
commission
can
know
and
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
review
it
until
it
knows
what
--
under
what
conditions
this
merger
is
to
exist.
that's
--
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
that's
correct
sir
and
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
i
think
they
have
to
find
where
the
place
is.
i
mean,
as
boston
and
main
be
part
of
a

mr.
howard

trienens
i
think
it
differ
--
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
as
--
i
think
when
we
analyze
just
what
the
problem
is,
you
come
to
that.
this

with
that
basic
problem
of
finding
a

mr.

the

is
in
the
same
boat
as
these
other
roads.
it's
threatened
by
penn-central.
it
too
should
have
a
home.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
new
haven
and
only
new
haven,
they
have
found
where
the
home
should
be.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
in
the
case
of
the
new
haven,
although
they
permit
immediate
consummation
of
penn-central
and
find
that
penn-central
shall
be
the
future
home
of
new
haven.
new
haven
is
not
included
in
penn-central
along
with
consummation.
they
have
to
go
--
when
their
worry
weight
through
not
only
commission
hearings,
bankruptcy
court
hearings
and
what
have
you
and
as
the
vice
president
of
the
new
york
central
said,
"we
don't
know
when
if
ever
new
haven
will
actually
be
included
in
the
penn-central
system".
we
have
no
assurance
that
if
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
yes
sir
but
with
the
commission
assurance
that
it
is
a
--
going
to
require
the
states
to
support
the
passing
of
business.
there's
a
--
the
commission's
assurance
that
the
states
are
ultimately
going
to
have
to
support
the
passing
of
business
although
you're
right,
it
goes
locked,
stocked
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
will
go
that
far
sir.
i
think
that
once
you
determine
the
place
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
because
in
the
new
haven
case,
you
decided
where
the
place
shall
be.
the
new
haven
shall
be
in
penn-central.
now,
it's
true
that
they
haven't
gotten
it
in
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i'm
assuming
that
the
penn
plus
central
plus
new
haven
is
the
map
that
the
commission
is
striving
for
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
know
that
and
i
also
don't
know
what
boston-maine,
erie
and
d
&
h
shall
be
part
of
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
agree
that
you
can't
--
all
i'm
trying
to
make
the
distinction
between
is
that
whether
you
have
to
wait
until
the
last
corporate
document
is
signed.
once
you've
assured
where
the
place
is
going
to
be,
maybe
it
is
in
the
new
haven,
there
some
very
difficult
problems
in
the
new
haven
inclusion.
the
commission
said,
"actual
inclusion
of
new
haven
will
not
be
easy".
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
now,
the
problem
is
pointed
out.
this
problem
is
pointed
out
by
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
the
assumptions,
the
basic
assumptions
that
underlie
the
majority
opinion
below.
the
basic
assumption
was
and
this
is
the
paraphrase
that
we
know
two
things.
first,
we
know
the
time
period
is
going
to
be
short
and
we
know
where
the
home
is
for
these
three
critical
roads.
it
takes
no
great
clairvoyance
to
the
majority
opinion
to
know
that
erie,
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
are
going
to
be
in
n
&
w,
that
the
commission
will
order
that.
now,
we
have
a
vivid
insight
into
the
accuracy
of
that
clairvoyance
because
commissioner
webb
who
participated
in
the
decisions
below
has
come
out
for
the
report
in
the
very
case
that
judge
friendly
was
forecasting
as
the
result.
and
i'd
like
to
read
and
tell
you
for
a
moment
about
the
analysis
that
shows
you
that
why
this
is
such
a
basic
problem.
the
first
place,
commissioner
webb
said
that
neither
this
case,
he's
talking
about
the
effort
to
get
erie
and
so
forth,
b
&
m
into
n
&
w.
either
this
case
nor
penn-central
can
be
fully
understood,
its
consideration
of
one
is
divorced
from
the
other.
unfortunately
a
commission's
action
deciding
the
cases
separately
has
tended
to
blur
vital
issues
common
to
both
proceeding.
now,
here's
where
the
trouble
comes.
commissioner
webb
looked
at
penn-central
ad
said,
what
are
the
alternatives?
alternative
one,
boston
and
maine
for
example
as
an
independent
railroad,
that's
out.
penn-central
will
destroy
boston
and
maine.
so
consummation
of
penn-central
forecloses
that
possibility.
independence
is
out.
this
is
why
they
can't
take
the
thing
one
jump
at
a
time
because
penn-central
forecloses
that
possibility,
never
before
in
these
cases.
two,
boston
and
maine
is
forced
in
n
&
w.
that's
a
solution.
that's
the
one
the
lower
court
assumed
what
happened.
he
says
that
can't
be
because
of
the
financial
facts
to
life,
we
cannot
force
boston
and
maine
in
n
&
w.
what's
left?
number
three.
the
only
alternative,
b
&
m
goes
to
penn-central
where
the
financial
terms
can
be
found
because
b
&
m
is
worth
more
to
penn-central.
b
&
m
has
strategic
value
to
penn-central
and
what
is
the
strategic
value?
it
gives
penn-central
monopoly
of
new
england.
now,
how
come
we
--
all
of
a
sudden
have
a
monopoly
of
new
england?
why
that's
necessarily
implied
from
the
decisions
before
this
court?
according
to
commissioner
webb,
necessarily
implied.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
rutland
went
broke.
they
weren't
able
to
reorganize
it.
the
state
of
vermont
took
over
that
part
of
the
rutland
that
it
desired
to
continue
operating
and
that
part
of
it
is
in
operation
as
the
state
of
vermont
railroad
or
the
vermont
railroad
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
central
of
vermont?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
just
don't
know.
i
don't
say
it
disappeared,
i
just
don't
know
about
that,
sorry.
what
i'm
trying
to
illustrate
is
that
this
analysis
of
what
happens
to
boston
and
maine
is
a
vivid
example
of
the
kind
of
a
box
the
commission
has
gotten
itself
into
by
letting
penn-central
be
consummated
immediately.
put
the
--
by
letting
this
consummation
go
through
at
once
you
force
further
steps.
this
is
why
this
is
different.
he
force
some
more
steps.
and
the
commission
simply
drifts
by
implication
into
a
monopoly
in
new
england.
now,
you
can
look
at
the
maps
that
we've
attached
to
our
brief
and
see
what
kind
of
a
system
penn-central
would
be
if
you
put
these
three
railroads
and
one
of
them
into
penn-central.
now
the
solicitor
general's
map
number
one
does
that,
it
puts
them
all
into
penn-central.
and
when
you
examine
that,
you
find
the
monopoly
is
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
r-map
a
plus
r-map
b
which
are
put
together
in
the
solicitor
general's
map
number
one.
oh,
they
were
simply
drawn
on
top
of
each
other.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no.
now
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
solicitor
--
yes,
that's
the
commission
sir,
the
solicitor
general.
the
point
is
that
the
commission
has
done
this.
maybe
you
can
look
at
this
map
and
say
someday
the
commission
might
find
that
map
with
that
monopoly
east
of
buffalo
or
that
monopoly
in
new
england.
that's
consistent
with
the
public
interest
when
you
weigh
this
and
that
and
everything.
that
may
be
if
you
look
at
it.
you
might
find
that.
the
problem
here
is
that
they
are
backing
into
it
by
implication.
they
are
backing
into
it
because
they
got
themselves
in
a
box
by
permitting
immediate
consummation
and
the
key
to
this
is
that
the
commission
has
never
given
any
consideration
to
whether
they
should
permit
a
monopoly
in
new
england.
the
commission's
examiners
found
them,
the
commission
adopt
this
finding
that
the
commission
has
made
no
effort
--
that's
not
my
words
that's
the
examiner's,
no
effort
to
appraise
the
competitive
impact
of
putting
erie
or
d
&
h
or
b
&
m
into
the
penn-central
system.
so
at
this
day,
there
was
no
effort
having
even
been
made
to
see
whether
this
resulted
what
might
be
the
end
of
the
road
is
in
the
public
interest,
or
drifting
into
that
by
implication
because
we're
taking
a
step,
immediate
consummation
of
penn-central
that
forces
more
steps.
and
that's
why
we
say
that
until
you
know
what
the
conditions
are,
you
can't
do
the
job
under
section
5
(2).
you
don't
know
whether
the
transaction
has
condition,
is
there,
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
but
if
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
commissioner
webb.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
the
beauty
of
the
boston
and
maine
is
that
it
has
strategic
value
to
boston
and
to
the
new
york
central
and
pennsylvania.
if
they
just
let
it
rot
away
because
they
have
a
parallel
line,
they
get
a
monopoly
in
that
area,
they
can
pick
off
the
industries
they
want.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
but
not
over
to
penn-central
because
he
finds
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
it
doesn't
have
to
(inaudible)
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
there's
nothing
that
penn-central
--
well,
first
place,
the
only
problem
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
what
about
the
boston
and
maine?
what
is
there
to
say
that
the
boston
and
maine
could
not
continue
today
as
an
independent
railroad
indefinitely?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
all
he
said,
he
only
foreclosed
the
continued
operation
of
boston
and
maine
as
an
independent
because
penn-central
would
destroy
it.
if
there
were
no
penn-central,
you
would
have
the
opportunity
to
let
boston
and
maine
go
on
as
an
independent
railroad.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
on
that
assumption
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
because
it's
just
right
on
the
margin.
its
--
has
a
small
deficit.
it
drifts
along
--
and
it
drifts
along
from
day
to
day
and
there's
nobody
has
suggested
--
there's
nobody
suggested
that
boston
and
maine
won't
drift
along.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
thing
that
forces
this
and
i
think
that
the
outstanding
facts
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
believe
so
sir.
the
reason
i
said
that
and
i'll
quote
one
more
sentence
from
the
--
commissioner
webb's
analysis.
an
important
fact
is
that
the
inability
of
erie,
d
&
h
and
d
&
m
to
survive
as
an
independent
carrier
is
not
a
direct
consequence
of
c
&
o
or
b
&
o
or
nickel
plate
and
wabash
but
is
a
direct
and
inevitable
result
of
what
penn-central
will
do
to
them.
that's
why
the
fuss.
that's
why
we're
here.
it's
what
penn-central
will
do
to
them.
and
that's
what
the
commission
found.
i'm
not
here
arguing
that
the
commission
should
have
found
it.
i'm
saying
as
a
fact
the
commission
did
find
them
and
that's
what
we
start
with
and
that's
why
we
are
in
the
box
and
that's
why
all
these
ramifications.
now,
there's
one
other
critical
issue
that
was
left
wide
open
by
the
commission
and
that's
this
problem
of
whether
penn-central
should
be
required
to
pay
what's
called
the
capital
indemnity.
now,
this
is
important
because
it
may
be
the
key,
the
penn-central
pays
some
capital
indemnity
may
be
the
key
to
enabling
the
commission
to
put
erie
and
d
&
h
in
n
&
w.
in
fact,
commissioner
webb
said
that
if
you
reflected
the
losses
penn-central
would
impose
on
erie
and
d
&
h
in
the
value
of
those
two
roads
in
n
&
w,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
construct
equitable
terms
unless
erie
or
n
&
w
receive
capital
loss
indemnification
from
penn-central.
so
that
may
be
the
key
to
getting
erie
and
d
&
h.
and
how
was
that
left?
that's
left
wide
open.
the
--
central
is
arguing
that
the
commission
has
no
power
even
to
impose
it.
the
commission
or
the
central
has
left
--
reserved
the
right
of
judicial
reviews
to
that
power
so
this
key
to
putting
even
erie
and
d
&
h
might
be
the
key
to
putting
them
in
n
&
w
and
saving
them.
that's
left
wide
open
until
these
conditions
are
decided.
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
now
decide
it.
well
why
didn't
the
commission
finish
its
task
under
5
(2)?
why
is
all
this
left
wide
open?
there
must
be
some
compelling
reason,
what
is
it?
we
have
a
discussion
to
that
on
the
commission's
september
16th
report?
the
commission
dealt
first
with
this
problem,
should
we
wait
or
we
find
a
home.
should
we
defer
consummation
until
we
find
a
home
and
they
said,
"no,
that
might
take
several
years
and
it
would
delay
the
savings
of
over
$80
million
a
year
that
penn-central
would
produce".
now,
you
get
it
--
an
impression
from
reading
commission's
report
that
if
you
put
penn-central
in
immediately
great
savings
will
flow,
great
benefits
will
flow,
great
service
improvements
will
flow
but
there's
a
trick
to
this.
and
the
trick
is
you
got
to
level
on
the
question
of
under
what
circumstances
would
penn-central
go
into
effect
tomorrow
if
you
let
it
go
and
that's
because
of
these
traffic
conditions
again.
they'd
go
in
subject
to
these
traffic
conditions
and
they
would
be
tied
up
as
to
what
they
could
do.
it
wouldn't
stop
them
from
hurting
other
railroads
because
--
just
put
them
together.
the
diminution
of
competition
would
hurt
other
railroads.
but
they
would
be
stopped
from
improving
service
and
saving
money.
now,
is
this
my
idea,
my
interpretation?
no,
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania's
vice
president
of
traffic.
he
said
if
you
put
this
merger
through
subject
to
the
conditions,
these
traffic
conditions
that
would
go
into
effect,
we'd
be
so
tied
up
that
it
would
deprive
the
shipping
public
of
any
improved
service.
there
is
no
chance
of
any
substantial
savings
in
the
next
two
years.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
yes
and
that's
what
this
all
comes
down
to.
this
is
--
penn-central
is
to
get
through
because
--
not
what
it'll
do
for
new
haven
but
--
that
it
gives
a
tree
to
hang
a
new
haven
ornament
on,
maybe.
that's
what
its
all
coming
down
to
because
there
isn't
any
service
improvement
while
these
conditions
are
in
effect.
there
isn't
any
saving
five
years
away
under
these
conditions.
and
even
if
there
were
any
savings,
you've
got
to
get
over
the
idea
of
these
promises
that
it
would
be
reflected
in
lower
rates
because
the
penn
vice
president
cannot
conceive
of
that
happening.
so
there's
nothing
in
this
for
the
public
in
terms
of
savings,
service
or
rates.
you
put
it
in
under
these
conditions.
what
does
happen
of
course
is
that
there
is
a
diminution
of
competition
between
penn
and
central
but
there's
something
else
happens
if
the
commission
has
not
even
put
in
the
scales.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
between
penn
and
central?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
the
next
--
the
other
point
the
commission
never
even
leveled
on
was
the
diminution
and
competition
inherent
in
these
very
traffic
conditions
and
indemnity
conditions.
now,
we
put
in
some
evidence
which
we've
attached
to
our
reply
brief
by
a
dr.
baker
(ph),
professor
of
economics
at
yale.
he
shows
that
these
very
conditions
would
have
further
additional
anticompetitive
effects
as
market
sharing
and
revenue
sharing
devices.
now,
the
commission
has
never
weighed
that.
it
admitted
that
it
never
had
the
hearing
on
it.
it
hasn't
had
a
hearing
yet.
so
there
has
been
no
weighing
and
balancing
of
what
this
does,
the
competition
through
these
conditions.
what
if
any
benefits
you
could
ever
get
out
of
these
conditions
because
there
have
been
no
hearing
on
the
--
there's
no
hearing
of
it.
it
can't
have
been
weighed
and
balanced
because
it
wasn't
even
before
the
commission
at
the
time
of
the
september
16th
report.
well
now,
the
commission
went
even
further
in
saying
why
we
aren't
going
to
let
this
consummation
be
delayed
at
least
for
six
or
12
months
until
we
have
a
hearing
on
what
these
temporary
conditions
are
like.
that
was
the
last
point
they
can
do.
why
shouldn't
we
at
least
hold
this
up
till
we
have
a
hearing
to
see
what
kind
of
temporary
conditions
even
if
we're
going
to
forget
what
happens
to
boston
and
maine
and
erie,
c
&
j
and
the
others
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
completed
on
these
temporary
traffic
and
indemnity
conditions.
we
completed
the
hearing
on
december
16th.
briefs
are
to
be
filed
january
16th
and
reply
briefs
february
6th.
the
matter
will
end
--
be
taken
under
advisement
by
the
commission
without
oral
argument.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
record
--
the
hearing
record
is
closed,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
indemnity
is
what
i
was
referring
to
with
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
hearing
on
the
capital
indemnity
was
begun
on
october
31st,
concluded
on
november
15th,
16th
somewhere
in
there
argued
before
the
whole
commission
on
november
28th
and
now
under
advisement.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
way
of
knowing
it.
i'm
a
mere
practitioner,
defensive
body.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
directing
ourselves
right
at
this
question
on
why
don't
you
hold
it
up
for
six
or
12
months
why
you
at
least
work
out
the
temporary
condition?
the
commission
said
we
won't
take
the
chance
because
of
the
new
haven.
now
in
this
connection,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recreate
the
atmosphere
surrounding
that
connection.
they
were
barraged
with
telegrams
--
letters.
senators
wrote
that
immediate
consummation
was
essential
to
save
the
continued
operation
of
the
--
they
got
a
wire
from
a
governor.
the
public
interest
requires
prompt
inclusion
of
new
haven,
therefore
prompt
consummation
of
penn-central.
they
all
equated
prompt
consummation
of
penn-central
with
prompt
inclusion
of
new
haven
without
realizing
they
didn't
match.
there
was
going
to
be
a
long
hiatus
and
nobody
knew
when
if
ever
new
haven
would
get
in
even
if
penn-central
were
consummated
yesterday.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
say
that's
what
the
new
york
central
traffic
vice
president
said,
"when
do
you
expect
to
have
new
haven
in?"
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
in
if
ever
assumed
you
consummate
because
who
knows
at
the
least,
the
bankruptcy
problems
they've
got,
the
problem
of
whether
they
even
had
a
vote
to
the
creditors.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
can
work
it
out.
get
some
great
new
york
law
firms
who
are
contending
that
without
a
vote
of
the
creditors
who
might
prefer
to
take
another
route
to
--
they
can't
work
it
on
that's
being
litigated
now
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
these
problems
were
all
laid
up
in
the
district
court
and
here's
the
point
the
district
court
was
unanimous
on.
the
district
court
did
not
decide
this
on
the
new
haven
problem,
either
the
delay
or
the
risk.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
administrative
law,
you'd
think
that
when
the
district
court
unanimously
rejected
the
decisive
ground
on
which
the
commission
puts
this
that'd
be
the
end
of
the
case.
it's
a
cheney
doctrine.
you
got
to
uphold
the
commission
order
on
the
ground
stated
by
the
commission
or
you
not
uphold
it
all.
it
should've
been
sent
back
to
them.
the
district
court
went
on.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
it's
in
this
court
despite
that
unanimous
holding
below
that
the
appellees
are
saying
that
we
want
this
court
to
hold
--
to
let
penn-central
go
through
right
away
because
of
the
new
haven
problem.
now,
what
is
the
new
haven
problem?
the
problem
is
as
they
say
it,
this
merger
is
going
to
fall
apart.
there'll
be
no
place
to
put
the
new
haven.
that's
what
this
case
now
comes
down
to.
this
court
has
to
believe
in
effect
that
penn
and
central,
they
don't
really
want
this
merger
very
badly.
they're
willing
to
do
it
for
the
public
interest
to
have
a
place
for
new
haven
but
have
left
to
themselves
they
just
soon
walk
away
and
leave
the
whole
thing
if
you
--
if
they're
made
to
wait
any
longer.
now
this
is
nonsense
for
reasons
that
we've
given
some
details.
major
railroad
mergers
were
far
less
saving
the
needs
if
held
together
much
longer.
and
the
glue
that
keeps
penn-central
stuck
together
is
the
fact
that
whenever
they
get
these
problems
resolved
they
got
$81
million
a
year
or
maybe
$120
million,
there's
evidence
to
that
effect.
but
at
least
$81
million
a
year
in
savings,
that's
what
keeps
the
stock
together.
quite
apart
from
an
addition
to
all
the
service
benefits
that
will
crack
out
of
business.
only
last
july,
july
of
1966
these
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
stockholders
voted
99.9,
99.2
respectively
percent
of
those
voting,
or
87%
of
all
stocks
to
reaffirm
these
merger
subject
to
all
these
conditions
and
despite
the
fact
that
--
be
these
delays
and
get
any
saving.
but
why
did
they
do
that?
well
even
with
their
improved
earnings
of
$120
million
a
year
this
merger
is
going
to
increase
their
earnings
about
two-thirds
to
a
double.
here
you're
owning
stock
in
a
company
that's
earning
about
550
a
share
and
these
merger
savings
alone
are
going
to
give
you
another
$3.50
to
$5
of
shared
earnings.
of
course
they
are
going
to
hold
together.
of
course
they
want
it.
and
i
might
also
add
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
before
the
commission
on
this
whole
scare
tactic
of
falling
apart.
no
evidence
whatever
for
the
commission
on
this
september
16th
report.
the
only
evidence
that
has
come
in
lately
and
n
&
w
has
been
denied
the
opportunity
even
to
rebut
it.
so
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
it.
this
is
all
something
that
you're
asked
to
believe
that
penn-central
is
just
going
to
come
apart
with
all
these
attractions
ultimately.
it's
just
going
to
fall
apart
before
your
very
own
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
sir.
in
the
nickel
plate
-
norfolk
and
western
there
was
a
six-year
limit
put
in
at
the
insistence
of
pennsylvania.
in
this
penn-central
agreement
there
is
no
time
limit.
penn-central
is
as
fragile
as
everybody
in
this
side
says
it
is,
it
can't
be
as
good
as
everybody's
been
led
to
believe.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
n
&
w
in
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
these
railroads
have
a
double
interest
on
these.
we
have
a
double
interest
in
it
and
i'm
counsel
for
n
&
w
and
i'll
tell
you
exactly
what
our
double
interest
is.
one
of
them
is
that
were
parties
to
a
fraternity
suit
that's
going
on.
we
got
two
ways
in
which
erie,
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
are
going
to
be
part
of
an
n
&
w
system.
commission
found
that
that
was
our
interest.
we
want
to
have
a
balanced
system
in
the
east.
we're
going
to
be
stuck
with
these
railroads
in
some
form
or
another
we
think.
and
we're
very
much
concerned
with
what
happens
to
them.
but
we
have
a
very
great
interest
quite
apart
from
our
obligations
ever
to
take
these
railroads
on.
n
&
w
in
effect
is
at
the
crossroads
in
this
business.
it's
been
a
coal
carrier
which
isn't
a
rail
competitor
with
anything.
it
was
owned
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
now
was
cut
loose
with
the
nickel
plate
and
the
wabash.
we
are
just
emerging
as
a
competitive
rail
carrier
in
the
east
and
by
competitive,
i
mean
from
merchandised
traffic.
the
question
we
face
is
whether
we're
going
to
go
back
to
holding
coal
and
have
penn-central
dominating
the
east
which
they
would
under
this
--
to
no
we
are
headed
or
whether
we're
going
to
be
a
competitive
factor
for
merchandised
traffic
in
the
east
whether
we're
going
to
be
in
the
balanced
competition
or
whether
we're
just
not
going
to
be
in
the
team
at
all.
that
is
our
critical
interest
within
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
goes
--
i
don't
think
it
goes
quite
that
far.
its
true
that
if
we
wanted
to
force
the
hand
of
the
commission
and
just
wanted
to
get
into
n
&
w
seeing
all
through,
maybe
the
best
thing
for
us
would
be
to
let
penn-central
go
through
right
now.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
were
controlled.
we
were
--
we're
--
we
were
owned
by
pennsylvania
railroad.
they
were
all
over
our
board
and
over
our
executive
committee.
nobody
in
n
&
w
could
have
gone
down
there
and
entered
an
(inaudible)
all
--
what
we
did
--
what
n
&
w
did
the
first
crack
out
of
the
box
right
after
the
examiner's
report
where
they
said,
"well,
you're
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what's
happened
to
turn
us
loose
is
that
its
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
is
part
of
the
three-system
plan
which
the
pennsylvania
sponsored
in
its
proposing
were
to
be
one
of
the
three
systems
were
to
be
half
to
their
side.
and
that
part
--
as
part
of
the
--
of
a
move
to
create
that
system
they
cut
us
loose.
that's
how
we
got
through.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
could've
done
something,
yes
sir.
and
they
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
were
in
this
position
as
we
are
now,
state
the
--
the
parallel
situation
of
n
&
w
and
that
also.
we
were
in
the
position
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
in
examiner's
reports.
we
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
against
improved
service.
we
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
against
savings.
what
we
don't
want
to
do
is
say,
"well,
let's
have
penn-central
it
will
produce
all
that",
and
how
do
we
solve
the
problems,
well
like
the
examiner
said
the
rest
of
the
east
is
somehow
got
to
get
along
together
and
cooperate
and
we
tried
to
work
out
a
plan
which
were
--
still
hoping
to
get
the
hearing.
hearings
are
set
now
after
a
years
delay.
we
undertook
to
try
and
work
out
the
other
half
of
the
east
so
it
could
live
with
penn-central.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
this
is
a
matter
that's
common
in
n
&
w.
n
&
w
and
c
&
o
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
are
merger
partners
in
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
--
excuse
me.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
feel
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
b
&
o
and
c
&
o?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
n
&
w
and
three
lines
was
found
to
have
benefits
and
service,
benefits
in
savings
and
not
to
hurt
another
soul
in
the
east
and
was
to
gain
those
benefits
and
pennsylvania
permitted
that
because
it
was
part
of
a
three-system
need.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
was
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we've
been
trying
to
get
a
hearing
since
october
1965
on
whether
our
plan
of
a
balanced
system
is
in
the
public
interest.
that
has
been
opposed
by
pennsylvania.
we
have
now
on
--
december
30th
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
now
gotten
an
order
setting
ours
down
for
a
hearing.
so
that's
moving
also.
that
one's
under
way.
we'll
serve
the
evidence
this
winter
and
have
it
by
this
spring.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
didn't
comport
with
the
pennsylvania
plan
for
a
three
system
in
the
east
which
they
were
dominating.
i
asked
mr.
--
the
penn
board
chairman,
i
say,
“do
you
still
oppose
even
letting
n
&
w
seeing
--
will
have
a
hearing
and
whether
there
poses
in
the
public
interest.
it
sure
does.
he
opposes
even
the
hearing.
so
it
departs
from
the
penn
plan.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
we
think
that
the
way
to
get
off
the
benefit
and
the
balance
competition
which
is
the
trip.
and
if
you're
going
to
let
penn
go
through
with
territory
wide
system
with
half
the
east
we
think
that
the
--
an
alternative
should
be
explored
is
a
n
&
w-c
&
o
c
as
the
nucleus
for
the
other
half
of
the
east
to
survive
balanced
competition.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
erie,
d
&
h,
b
&
m,
central,
new
jersey
and
(inaudible).
or
would
do
--
it'd
be
the
other
half
as
shown
in
our
maps
at
two
--
our
maps
b
and
c,
the
other
of
the
east,
so-called
unprotected
carriers.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
and
we've
offered
to
do
that
and
we
think
we
can
do
it
because
with
the
strength
and
the
competitive
balance
that
would
give
us,
we
could
do
it.
we've
afford
to
do
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
that's
the
area
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
it
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
it
would
do
your
honor,
it
would
require
n
&
w
as
it
presently
exist
that
the
present
n
&
w
would
require
to
take
in
erie
and
d
&
h.
it
would
not
require
to
take
in
boston
and
maine.
if
boston
and
maine,
it
says,
we
--
they
couldn't
work
out
terms
that
should
go
to
penn-central.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
that's
the
report
in
which
they
say,
let
that
go
to
penn-central.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
ask
this
court
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
our
position
is
first,
that
there
are
number
of
findings
with
respect
to
material
issues
which
weren't
made
but
basically
is
that
section
5
(2)
of
the
act,
this
is
a
statutory
argument.
section
5
(2)
in
the
act
says,
“that
transactions
as
conditioned
by
the
commission
shall
be
appraised,
decide
whether
those
transactions
as
conditioned
are
in
the
public
interest”.
we
say
it
as
a
matter
of
applying
that
statute
and
so
you
know
the
essential
terms
of
the
transaction,
you
don't
know
what
you're
approving.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
where
in
this
case,
they
have
found
that
the
essential
conditions
and
this
is
their
finding
that
they're
essential
not
collateral.
that
they
have
found
the
central
conditions
have
not
been
formulated
and
their
hand
is
forced
as
it
is
forced.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
howard
trienens.
this
is
the
penn-central
merger
case.
it's
probably
the
biggest
corporate
merger
ever.
the
cases
before
this
court
on
appeals
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
denying
injunctive
relief
against
an
order
of
interstate
commerce
commission
which
would
permit
immediate
consummation
of
the
penn-central
merger.
i
stress
immediate
because
by
the
very
nature
of
the
commission's
action
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
commission's
order
and
on
appeal,
the
lawfulness
of
the
commission's
order
permitting
immediate
consummation
was
necessarily
before
the
court
even
though
the
matter
arose
on
applications
for
interlocutory
injunction.
now,
basically
this
case
arose
under
section
5
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
that
act
enabled
the
commission
to
approve
an
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
merger
transactions
which
are
found
to
be
as
conditioned
by
the
commission
or
found
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
problem
here
and
the
problem
i
will
develop
through
these
rather
laborious
facts
is
that
no
one
can
know
today
whether
this
merger
transaction
as
conditioned
is
or
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
the
reason
you
can't
know
is
because
you
don't
know
the
conditions.
you
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
transaction
this
is
yet.
the
commission
has
found
that
certain
conditions
are
essential
that
the
certain
conditions
must
be
attached.
they
have
not
been
found
either
for
the
long
term
or
the
short
term.
now
realistically,
we
believe
that
until
those
conditions
are
found
and
passed
upon
no
one
can
know
what
the
future
of
competitive
rail
transportation
in
the
east
will
be.
on
stating
the
facts,
the
first
and
dominant
fact
is
the
penn
and
central
today
had
half
the
railroad
business
in
the
east.
the
figures
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
inserted
in
the
end
of
our
brief
a
series
of
maps
showing
the
proposed
penn-central
system
and
showing
the
remaining
roads
and
the
question
that
has
dominated
the
commission
proceedings,
the
question
before
this
court
is
how
the
other
half
of
the
east
is
going
to
live
in
the
face
of
penn-central.
of
the
hearings
before
the
commission,
penn
and
central
showed
that
they
would
create
a
territory-wide
single
line
service
serving
all
major
ports,
all
major
gateways
and
as
a
single
line
railroad
throughout
the
east
they
would
provide
great
operative
savings
and
great
improvements
in
service.
a
single
line
service
has
great
advantage.
single
line
service
saves
money
but
it
also
improved
service.
and
the
commission
relying
on
those
improvements
in
service
and
efficiencies
found
at
this
merger
was
in
the
public
interest
notwithstanding
the
diminution
of
competition.
but
these
very
same
service
improvements
are
the
things
that
caused
the
problem
for
the
other
eastern
roads
and
raised
the
questions
of
how
they
are
going
to
live
in
the
face
of
this
penn-central
system.
now,
following
the
hearings
before
the
commission,
the
examiners
found
that
these
improvements
would
occur.
they
also
found
that
the
merger
was
necessary
because
of
the
survival,
save
and
enable
to
survive
the
penn
and
central
companies
because
of
the
failing
company
doctrine
specifically
in
those
terms,
the
east
was
a
failing
industry.
now
the
examiners
recognized
that
when
you
put
penn
and
central
together
they
would
cause
shifts
in
the
traffic
patterns.
they
would
attract
traffic.
but
the
examiners
felt
and
found
that
the
other
half
of
these
could
live
because
by
cooperating
among
themselves
they
could
attract
and
meet
penn-central.
now
with
the
other
half
of
the
east
by
working
together
could
offset
these
shifts
in
traffic
that
would
attract
traffic
to
penn-central.
as
to
new
haven
they
didn't
find
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
can't
answer
that
specifically,
i
know
it
anticipated
some
additional
mergers.
i
think
it
contemplated
putting
some
of
the
roads
in
at
least
some
of
the
other
systems
but
the
exact
form
of
the
restructuring
that
was
contemplated
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
examine
report.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
had
gotten
together
at
the
stage
of
the
commission's
decision.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
the
n
&
w-nickel
plate
was
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
had
gotten
together.
now,
the
important
point
and
it's
expressed
greatly
by
the
counsel
for
the
commission
in
their
brief
at
page
48
where
they
find
or
state
that
b
&
o-c
&
o
was
permitted
to
go
ahead
on
a
specific
finding
that
it
would
not
have
any
adverse
effect
on
any
other
eastern
railroad.
n
&
w-nickel
plate
was
permitted
to
go
ahead
as
commission
counsel
frankly
state
because
it
would
have
no
material
adverse
effect
on
any
other
railroad
in
the
area.
and
in
fact,
in
n
&
w-nickel
plate
they
found
that
that
merger
would
help
of
the
railroads
and
yet
to
bear
in
mind
that
putting
together
n
&
w-nickel
plate
for
example,
put
together
a
railroad
almost
as
big
but
not
quite
as
big
as
penn
alone
already
was.
that's
why
with
its
rather
narrower
geographic
cover,
it
didn't
raise
the
problems
the
penn-central
raises.
now
that
--
the
end
of
the
hearing
stage,
after
the
hearing
stage
that
norfolk
and
western
which
had
been
enabled
the
merger
with
nickel
plate
was
set
free
as
a
part
of
that
merger.
it
was
set
free
of
control
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
up
to
that
point,
pennsylvania
controlled
n
&
w.
what
n
&
w
is
today,
penn-central
wield
it.
it
was
part
of
the
three-system
plan,
part
of
the
penn-central's
plan
for
how
to
carve
up
the
east.
and
it
was
after
the
hearing
stage,
after
the
examiner
had
found
that
the
way
to
meet
penn-central's
for
the
other
half
to
get
together
that
n
&
w
and
c
&
o
proposed
that
there
be
hearings
as
to
whether
a
merger
was
the
way
they
should
get
together.
that
proposal
--
application
has
been
filed.
the
hearings
been
held
up
for
a
year
or
so
but
it's
now
been
set
for
this
winter,
this
spring.
oh,
by
the
time
this
case
reached
the
commission
level,
this
was
a
very
different
case.
the
survival
problem,
the
failing
company
doctrine
was
out
of
it.
penn-central
which
between
them
had
earned
$7
million
in
1961,
that
earned
$122
million
in
1965.
in
1966,
their
estimate
is
$150
million
of
net
income
and
that's
before
reflecting
any
merger
savings
or
other
merger
benefits.
the
commission
did
not
and
it
could
not
find
that
this
merger
was
essential
to
the
survival
of
penn
or
central.
the
commission's
theory
in
its
april
6th
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
was
total
net
income
of
the
corporations
that
are
being
merged,
whole
net
income.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
addressed
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
addressed
--
well,
he
mention
both
in
its
reports,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
net
railway
operating
income
which
is
the
--
i
can't
answer
that
because
you
have
to
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
believe
it
is
sir
for
this
reason.
if
you're
talking
about
the
total
financial
strength
of
the
two
enterprises
that
are
going
to
be
put
together,
the
stock
that's
going
to
be
exchanged,
the
financial
strength
of
the
enterprise,
you
talk
about
what
those
enterprises
earn.
i
agree
that
if
you
are
talking
about
the
earnings
from
competitive
rail
service
that
the
rate
of
return
on
rail
service
is
important
in
financial
strength.
however,
if
you're
talking
about
their
strength
as
competitors,
it's
how
much
of
the
market
they
have.
how
many
shoes
they
had
in
brown
shoe,
how
many
grocery
sales
they
had
in
(inaudible)
grocery.
and
if
that
--
that's
the
reason
i
give
the
figures
measuring
the
amount
of
business
they
have
in
the
competitive
rail
area.
it's
true
that
pennsylvania
has
vast
interest
outside
the
railroad
business.
it's
true
that
n
&
w
has
considered
on
a
coal
traffic
it's
not
rail
competitor
to
anybody.
it's
in
the
competitive
area.
you
look
at
the
competitive
market
shares
and
if
you're
looking
at
the
total
corporations,
those
of
the
dollar
figures
i
gave,
the
total
earnings
of
the
company.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
penn
and
central
aren't
in
taxes
so
it's
no
difference
to
them
at
the
moment.
now,
the
commission
as
i
say
did
not
rely
on
this
survival
problem,
this
failing
company
doctrine.
the
commission
recognized
that
these
service
improvements
would
occur
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
railroad
earnings
at
a
higher
level.
and
they
approved
the
merger
as
outweighing
the
diminution
of
competition.
now,
with
respect
to
three
railroads
however,
the
commission
found
that
this
penn-central
merger
would
destroy
them.
this
is
what
distinguishes
penn-central.
we
have
a
finding
that
this
merger
would
destroy
at
least
three
of
the
railroads
not
coming
to
new
haven.
i
like
to
read
two
sentences
that
are
the
key
for
the
commission's
analysis.
they
first
found
that
unless
somehow
protected
these
three
railroads
would
be
adversely
affected
by
the
proposed
merger
to
a
serious
degree
and
would
be
severely
handicapped
in
providing
the
required
transportation
service.
now
the
commission
then
concluded
that
it
is
doubtful
that
without
inclusion
in
a
major
system,
these
three
carriers
could
withstand
the
competition
of
the
applicant's
merge.
and
unless
they
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
their
future,
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
at
this
time
even
though
approving
the
merger.
nor
was
the
commission
drew
the
line
between
when
you
authorized
consummation
and
approval
of
the
merger.
and
they
found
that
we
will
let
penn-central
go
ahead
right
away
even
though
we
haven't
found
a
home
for
these
railroads.
and
why
because
we
have
worked
out
some
specific
traffic
and
indemnity
conditions
and
they
further
set
our
approval
for
merger,
for
underlayed
consummation
shall
be
subject
to
the
conditions
specifically
determined
by
us.
however,
now
we're
--
they
said
we're
going
to
let
it
go
through
before
we
found
the
home
for
these
roads
but
we're
going
to
work
out
something
in
the
interim
and
are
letting
it
--
this
merger
go
through
now
is
subject
to
those
specific
protected
conditions.
now,
what
were
those
conditions?
there
are
two
kinds,
one
of
the
traffic
conditions
which
were
designed
to
freeze
and
tie
up
penn-central
in
their
actual
improvement
of
service
so
if
they
just
couldn't
improve
service
and
couldn't
attract
traffic.
now
that
doesn't
do
the
job
even
if
you
froze
penn-central
solid,
that
doesn't
do
the
job
because
the
very
fact
of
putting
them
together
eliminating
competition
between
them
causes
a
diversion
of
traffic
from
these
other
railroads
so
--
and
the
commission
didn't
stop
with
the
traffic
conditions.
it
went
on
to
these
so-called
indemnity
conditions.
indemnity
conditions
and
that's
a
misnomer.
these
aren't
indemnities
for
loss.
this
is
a
revenue
sharing
pool.
there's
a
formula
where
you
put
penn
and
central
and
erie's
money
together
and
they
get
earnings
out
of
it
as
a
share
of
that.
erie
is
guaranteed
share.
now,
these
conditions
were
critical
to
the
commission's
decision.
they
were
noble.
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
them
before,
there
was
no
hearing
on
them.
they
came
out
of
the
blue.
well
after
this
commission
hearing,
the
protected
carriers,
these
three
protected
carriers,
they
asked
for
reconsideration.
they
asked
reconsideration
on
the
grounds
that
these
conditions
were
wholly
inadequate.
the
unprotected
carriers
who'd
been
counting
on
the
cooperation
of
everybody
outside
penn-central
were
suddenly
for
--
faced
with
the
problem
that
there
was
a
pool,
a
community
of
interest
created
where
three
of
these
roads
were
going
to
be
open
to
penn-central
orbit
at
least
temporarily.
so
both
the
protected
and
the
unprotected
carriers
asked
for
reconsiderations.
the
appellants,
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
also
asked
for
reconsideration.
the
commission
had
dismissed
its
claim
on
the
ground
that,
"oh
well,
c
&
e
i
will
have
an
offsetting
benefit
of
intensified
competition
between
its
connecting
carriers
in
penn,
one
of
the
connecting
carriers
being
erie.
there's
no
recognition
of
the
effect
of
this
revenue
pool
on
what
happens
to
erie's
competition.
now,
c
&
e
i,
the
commission
also
passed
off
its
problem
by
saying,
"oh,
c
&
e
i
can
provide
superior
service
in
that
area".
no
evidence
to
support
that
nor
there
is
any
evidence
that
a
possible
control
of
another
railroad
of
c
&
e
i
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
impact
to
penn-central
on
c
&
e
i.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
it's
to
st.
louis
and
then
to
louisville.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
from
chicago.
now,
these
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
decided
by
the
commission
in
the
so-called
september
16th
report
and
that
report
is
what
created
the
basic
issue
before
this
court.
because
that
report
undercut
the
whole
premise
of
the
basis
on
which
they
left
the
merger
consummated
immediately
in
april.
the
commission
first
acknowledged
the
valid
issues
that
have
been
raised
with
respect
to
these
new
conditions
and
they
acknowledged
further
that
as
to
the
unprotected
carriers
they
never
had
a
hearing
on
its
--
from
the
impact
of
these
conditions
on
them.
instead
of
deciding
these
matters,
having
a
hearing
raised
--
correcting
the
conditions,
giving
a
hearing
to
the
unprotected
carriers
as
to
what
these
all
did
to
them.
the
commission
let
penn-central
go
through
anyway.
it
rescinded
the
indemnity
conditions.
it
set
a
hearing
on
whether
there
should
be
any
indemnity
conditions
and
authorized
retroactive
reinstatement
that
a
hearing
on
what
the
traffic
conditions
ought
to
be
because
nobody
knew
by
that
time
what
they
meant.
but
it
permitted
immediate
consummation
to
penn-central
anyway.
and
it
didn't
even
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
cannot
answer
that
and
i
don't
--
and
i
want
to
answer
it
in
this
way
mr.
chief
justice.
we
cannot
answer
that
because
we
do
not
know
what
penn-central
is.
now
as
i'll
get
to,
we
don't
know
whether
penn-central
means
a
monopoly
of
new
england.
in
that
case,
we
might
be
against
it.
if
it
means
balanced
competition
with
another
system
or
other
systems,
we'd
be
for
it.
we
just
don't
know
because
we
don't
know
what
kind
of
an
animal
penn-central
is
until
we
know
what
the
conditions
are.
we
just
don't
know.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
commission
can
know
and
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
review
it
until
it
knows
what
--
under
what
conditions
this
merger
is
to
exist.
that's
--
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
that's
correct
sir
and
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
i
think
they
have
to
find
where
the
place
is.
i
mean,
as
boston
and
main
be
part
of
a
(voice

--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
it
differ
--
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
as
--
i
think
when
we
analyze
just
what
the
problem
is,
you
come
to
that.
this
temporary
conditions
with
that
basic
problem
of
finding
a
home.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
new
haven
is
in
the
same
boat
as
these
other
roads.
it's
threatened
by
penn-central.
it
too
should
have
a
home.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
new
haven
and
only
new
haven,
they
have
found
where
the
home
should
be.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
in
the
case
of
the
new
haven,
although
they
permit
immediate
consummation
of
penn-central
and
find
that
penn-central
shall
be
the
future
home
of
new
haven.
new
haven
is
not
included
in
penn-central
along
with
consummation.
they
have
to
go
--
when
their
worry
weight
through
not
only
commission
hearings,
bankruptcy
court
hearings
and
what
have
you
and
as
the
vice
president
of
the
new
york
central
said,
"we
don't
know
when
if
ever
new
haven
will
actually
be
included
in
the
penn-central
system".
we
have
no
assurance
that
if
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
yes
sir
but
with
the
commission
assurance
that
it
is
a
--
going
to
require
the
states
to
support
the
passing
of
business.
there's
a
--
the
commission's
assurance
that
the
states
are
ultimately
going
to
have
to
support
the
passing
of
business
although
you're
right,
it
goes
locked,
stocked
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
will
go
that
far
sir.
i
think
that
once
you
determine
the
place
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
because
in
the
new
haven
case,
you
decided
where
the
place
shall
be.
the
new
haven
shall
be
in
penn-central.
now,
it's
true
that
they
haven't
gotten
it
in
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i'm
assuming
that
the
penn
plus
central
plus
new
haven
is
the
map
that
the
commission
is
striving
for
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
know
that
and
i
also
don't
know
what
boston-maine,
erie
and
d
&
h
shall
be
part
of
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
agree
that
you
can't
--
all
i'm
trying
to
make
the
distinction
between
is
that
whether
you
have
to
wait
until
the
last
corporate
document
is
signed.
once
you've
assured
where
the
place
is
going
to
be,
maybe
it
is
in
the
new
haven,
there
some
very
difficult
problems
in
the
new
haven
inclusion.
the
commission
said,
"actual
inclusion
of
new
haven
will
not
be
easy".
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
now,
the
problem
is
pointed
out.
this
problem
is
pointed
out
by
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
the
assumptions,
the
basic
assumptions
that
underlie
the
majority
opinion
below.
the
basic
assumption
was
and
this
is
the
paraphrase
that
we
know
two
things.
first,
we
know
the
time
period
is
going
to
be
short
and
we
know
where
the
home
is
for
these
three
critical
roads.
it
takes
no
great
clairvoyance
to
the
majority
opinion
to
know
that
erie,
b
&
m
and
d
&
h
are
going
to
be
in
n
&
w,
that
the
commission
will
order
that.
now,
we
have
a
vivid
insight
into
the
accuracy
of
that
clairvoyance
because
commissioner
webb
who
participated
in
the
decisions
below
has
come
out
for
the
report
in
the
very
case
that
judge
friendly
was
forecasting
as
the
result.
and
i'd
like
to
read
and
tell
you
for
a
moment
about
the
analysis
that
shows
you
that
why
this
is
such
a
basic
problem.
the
first
place,
commissioner
webb
said
that
neither
this
case,
he's
talking
about
the
effort
to
get
erie
and
so
forth,
b
&
m
into
n
&
w.
either
this
case
nor
penn-central
can
be
fully
understood,
its
consideration
of
one
is
divorced
from
the
other.
unfortunately
a
commission's
action
deciding
the
cases
separately
has
tended
to
blur
vital
issues
common
to
both
proceeding.
now,
here's
where
the
trouble
comes.
commissioner
webb
looked
at
penn-central
ad
said,
what
are
the
alternatives?
alternative
one,
boston
and
maine
for
example
as
an
independent
railroad,
that's
out.
penn-central
will
destroy
boston
and
maine.
so
consummation
of
penn-central
forecloses
that
possibility.
independence
is
out.
this
is
why
they
can't
take
the
thing
one
jump
at
a
time
because
penn-central
forecloses
that
possibility,
never
before
in
these
cases.
two,
boston
and
maine
is
forced
in
n
&
w.
that's
a
solution.
that's
the
one
the
lower
court
assumed
what
happened.
he
says
that
can't
be
because
of
the
financial
facts
to
life,
we
cannot
force
boston
and
maine
in
n
&
w.
what's
left?
number
three.
the
only
alternative,
b
&
m
goes
to
penn-central
where
the
financial
terms
can
be
found
because
b
&
m
is
worth
more
to
penn-central.
b
&
m
has
strategic
value
to
penn-central
and
what
is
the
strategic
value?
it
gives
penn-central
monopoly
of
new
england.
now,
how
come
we
--
all
of
a
sudden
have
a
monopoly
of
new
england?
why
that's
necessarily
implied
from
the
decisions
before
this
court?
according
to
commissioner
webb,
necessarily
implied.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
rutland
went
broke.
they
weren't
able
to
reorganize
it.
the
state
of
vermont
took
over
that
part
of
the
rutland
that
it
desired
to
continue
operating
and
that
part
of
it
is
in
operation
as
the
state
of
vermont
railroad
or
the
vermont
railroad
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
central
of
vermont?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
just
don't
know.
i
don't
say
it
disappeared,
i
just
don't
know
about
that,
sorry.
what
i'm
trying
to
illustrate
is
that
this
analysis
of
what
happens
to
boston
and
maine
is
a
vivid
example
of
the
kind
of
a
box
the
commission
has
gotten
itself
into
by
letting
penn-central
be
consummated
immediately.
put
the
--
by
letting
this
consummation
go
through
at
once
you
force
further
steps.
this
is
why
this
is
different.
he
force
some
more
steps.
and
the
commission
simply
drifts
by
implication
into
a
monopoly
in
new
england.
now,
you
can
look
at
the
maps
that
we've
attached
to
our
brief
and
see
what
kind
of
a
system
penn-central
would
be
if
you
put
these
three
railroads
and
one
of
them
into
penn-central.
now
the
solicitor
general's
map
number
one
does
that,
it
puts
them
all
into
penn-central.
and
when
you
examine
that,
you
find
the
monopoly
is
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
r-map
a
plus
r-map
b
which
are
put
together
in
the
solicitor
general's
map
number
one.
oh,
they
were
simply
drawn
on
top
of
each
other.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no.
now
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
solicitor
--
yes,
that's
the
commission
sir,
the
solicitor
general.
the
point
is
that
the
commission
has
done
this.
maybe
you
can
look
at
this
map
and
say
someday
the
commission
might
find
that
map
with
that
monopoly
east
of
buffalo
or
that
monopoly
in
new
england.
that's
consistent
with
the
public
interest
when
you
weigh
this
and
that
and
everything.
that
may
be
if
you
look
at
it.
you
might
find
that.
the
problem
here
is
that
they
are
backing
into
it
by
implication.
they
are
backing
into
it
because
they
got
themselves
in
a
box
by
permitting
immediate
consummation
and
the
key
to
this
is
that
the
commission
has
never
given
any
consideration
to
whether
they
should
permit
a
monopoly
in
new
england.
the
commission's
examiners
found
them,
the
commission
adopt
this
finding
that
the
commission
has
made
no
effort
--
that's
not
my
words
that's
the
examiner's,
no
effort
to
appraise
the
competitive
impact
of
putting
erie
or
d
&
h
or
b
&
m
into
the
penn-central
system.
so
at
this
day,
there
was
no
effort
having
even
been
made
to
see
whether
this
resulted
what
might
be
the
end
of
the
road
is
in
the
public
interest,
or
drifting
into
that
by
implication
because
we're
taking
a
step,
immediate
consummation
of
penn-central
that
forces
more
steps.
and
that's
why
we
say
that
until
you
know
what
the
conditions
are,
you
can't
do
the
job
under
section
5
(2).
you
don't
know
whether
the
transaction
has
condition,
is
there,
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
but
if
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
commissioner
webb.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
the
beauty
of
the
boston
and
maine
is
that
it
has
strategic
value
to
boston
and
to
the
new
york
central
and
pennsylvania.
if
they
just
let
it
rot
away
because
they
have
a
parallel
line,
they
get
a
monopoly
in
that
area,
they
can
pick
off
the
industries
they
want.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
but
not
over
to
penn-central
because
he
finds
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
it
doesn't
have
to
(inaudible)
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
there's
nothing
that
penn-central
--
well,
first
place,
the
only
problem
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
what
about
the
boston
and
maine?
what
is
there
to
say
that
the
boston
and
maine
could
not
continue
today
as
an
independent
railroad
indefinitely?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
all
he
said,
he
only
foreclosed
the
continued
operation
of
boston
and
maine
as
an
independent
because
penn-central
would
destroy
it.
if
there
were
no
penn-central,
you
would
have
the
opportunity
to
let
boston
and
maine
go
on
as
an
independent
railroad.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
on
that
assumption
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
because
it's
just
right
on
the
margin.
its
--
has
a
small
deficit.
it
drifts
along
--
and
it
drifts
along
from
day
to
day
and
there's
nobody
has
suggested
--
there's
nobody
suggested
that
boston
and
maine
won't
drift
along.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
thing
that
forces
this
and
i
think
that
the
outstanding
facts
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
believe
so
sir.
the
reason
i
said
that
and
i'll
quote
one
more
sentence
from
the
--
commissioner
webb's
analysis.
an
important
fact
is
that
the
inability
of
erie,
d
&
h
and
d
&
m
to
survive
as
an
independent
carrier
is
not
a
direct
consequence
of
c
&
o
or
b
&
o
or
nickel
plate
and
wabash
but
is
a
direct
and
inevitable
result
of
what
penn-central
will
do
to
them.
that's
why
the
fuss.
that's
why
we're
here.
it's
what
penn-central
will
do
to
them.
and
that's
what
the
commission
found.
i'm
not
here
arguing
that
the
commission
should
have
found
it.
i'm
saying
as
a
fact
the
commission
did
find
them
and
that's
what
we
start
with
and
that's
why
we
are
in
the
box
and
that's
why
all
these
ramifications.
now,
there's
one
other
critical
issue
that
was
left
wide
open
by
the
commission
and
that's
this
problem
of
whether
penn-central
should
be
required
to
pay
what's
called
the
capital
indemnity.
now,
this
is
important
because
it
may
be
the
key,
the
penn-central
pays
some
capital
indemnity
may
be
the
key
to
enabling
the
commission
to
put
erie
and
d
&
h
in
n
&
w.
in
fact,
commissioner
webb
said
that
if
you
reflected
the
losses
penn-central
would
impose
on
erie
and
d
&
h
in
the
value
of
those
two
roads
in
n
&
w,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
construct
equitable
terms
unless
erie
or
n
&
w
receive
capital
loss
indemnification
from
penn-central.
so
that
may
be
the
key
to
getting
erie
and
d
&
h.
and
how
was
that
left?
that's
left
wide
open.
the
--
central
is
arguing
that
the
commission
has
no
power
even
to
impose
it.
the
commission
or
the
central
has
left
--
reserved
the
right
of
judicial
reviews
to
that
power
so
this
key
to
putting
even
erie
and
d
&
h
might
be
the
key
to
putting
them
in
n
&
w
and
saving
them.
that's
left
wide
open
until
these
conditions
are
decided.
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
now
decide
it.
well
why
didn't
the
commission
finish
its
task
under
5
(2)?
why
is
all
this
left
wide
open?
there
must
be
some
compelling
reason,
what
is
it?
we
have
a
discussion
to
that
on
the
commission's
september
16th
report?
the
commission
dealt
first
with
this
problem,
should
we
wait
or
we
find
a
home.
should
we
defer
consummation
until
we
find
a
home
and
they
said,
"no,
that
might
take
several
years
and
it
would
delay
the
savings
of
over
$80
million
a
year
that
penn-central
would
produce".
now,
you
get
it
--
an
impression
from
reading
commission's
report
that
if
you
put
penn-central
in
immediately
great
savings
will
flow,
great
benefits
will
flow,
great
service
improvements
will
flow
but
there's
a
trick
to
this.
and
the
trick
is
you
got
to
level
on
the
question
of
under
what
circumstances
would
penn-central
go
into
effect
tomorrow
if
you
let
it
go
and
that's
because
of
these
traffic
conditions
again.
they'd
go
in
subject
to
these
traffic
conditions
and
they
would
be
tied
up
as
to
what
they
could
do.
it
wouldn't
stop
them
from
hurting
other
railroads
because
--
just
put
them
together.
the
diminution
of
competition
would
hurt
other
railroads.
but
they
would
be
stopped
from
improving
service
and
saving
money.
now,
is
this
my
idea,
my
interpretation?
no,
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania's
vice
president
of
traffic.
he
said
if
you
put
this
merger
through
subject
to
the
conditions,
these
traffic
conditions
that
would
go
into
effect,
we'd
be
so
tied
up
that
it
would
deprive
the
shipping
public
of
any
improved
service.
there
is
no
chance
of
any
substantial
savings
in
the
next
two
years.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
yes
and
that's
what
this
all
comes
down
to.
this
is
--
penn-central
is
to
get
through
because
--
not
what
it'll
do
for
new
haven
but
--
that
it
gives
a
tree
to
hang
a
new
haven
ornament
on,
maybe.
that's
what
its
all
coming
down
to
because
there
isn't
any
service
improvement
while
these
conditions
are
in
effect.
there
isn't
any
saving
five
years
away
under
these
conditions.
and
even
if
there
were
any
savings,
you've
got
to
get
over
the
idea
of
these
promises
that
it
would
be
reflected
in
lower
rates
because
the
penn
vice
president
cannot
conceive
of
that
happening.
so
there's
nothing
in
this
for
the
public
in
terms
of
savings,
service
or
rates.
you
put
it
in
under
these
conditions.
what
does
happen
of
course
is
that
there
is
a
diminution
of
competition
between
penn
and
central
but
there's
something
else
happens
if
the
commission
has
not
even
put
in
the
scales.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
between
penn
and
central?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
the
next
--
the
other
point
the
commission
never
even
leveled
on
was
the
diminution
and
competition
inherent
in
these
very
traffic
conditions
and
indemnity
conditions.
now,
we
put
in
some
evidence
which
we've
attached
to
our
reply
brief
by
a
dr.
baker
(ph),
professor
of
economics
at
yale.
he
shows
that
these
very
conditions
would
have
further
additional
anticompetitive
effects
as
market
sharing
and
revenue
sharing
devices.
now,
the
commission
has
never
weighed
that.
it
admitted
that
it
never
had
the
hearing
on
it.
it
hasn't
had
a
hearing
yet.
so
there
has
been
no
weighing
and
balancing
of
what
this
does,
the
competition
through
these
conditions.
what
if
any
benefits
you
could
ever
get
out
of
these
conditions
because
there
have
been
no
hearing
on
the
--
there's
no
hearing
of
it.
it
can't
have
been
weighed
and
balanced
because
it
wasn't
even
before
the
commission
at
the
time
of
the
september
16th
report.
well
now,
the
commission
went
even
further
in
saying
why
we
aren't
going
to
let
this
consummation
be
delayed
at
least
for
six
or
12
months
until
we
have
a
hearing
on
what
these
temporary
conditions
are
like.
that
was
the
last
point
they
can
do.
why
shouldn't
we
at
least
hold
this
up
till
we
have
a
hearing
to
see
what
kind
of
temporary
conditions
even
if
we're
going
to
forget
what
happens
to
boston
and
maine
and
erie,
c
&
j
and
the
others
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
completed
on
these
temporary
traffic
and
indemnity
conditions.
we
completed
the
hearing
on
december
16th.
briefs
are
to
be
filed
january
16th
and
reply
briefs
february
6th.
the
matter
will
end
--
be
taken
under
advisement
by
the
commission
without
oral
argument.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
record
--
the
hearing
record
is
closed,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
indemnity
is
what
i
was
referring
to
with
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
hearing
on
the
capital
indemnity
was
begun
on
october
31st,
concluded
on
november
15th,
16th
somewhere
in
there
argued
before
the
whole
commission
on
november
28th
and
now
under
advisement.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
way
of
knowing
it.
i'm
a
mere
practitioner,
defensive
body.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
directing
ourselves
right
at
this
question
on
why
don't
you
hold
it
up
for
six
or
12
months
why
you
at
least
work
out
the
temporary
condition?
the
commission
said
we
won't
take
the
chance
because
of
the
new
haven.
now
in
this
connection,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recreate
the
atmosphere
surrounding
that
connection.
they
were
barraged
with
telegrams
--
letters.
senators
wrote
that
immediate
consummation
was
essential
to
save
the
continued
operation
of
the
--
they
got
a
wire
from
a
governor.
the
public
interest
requires
prompt
inclusion
of
new
haven,
therefore
prompt
consummation
of
penn-central.
they
all
equated
prompt
consummation
of
penn-central
with
prompt
inclusion
of
new
haven
without
realizing
they
didn't
match.
there
was
going
to
be
a
long
hiatus
and
nobody
knew
when
if
ever
new
haven
would
get
in
even
if
penn-central
were
consummated
yesterday.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
say
that's
what
the
new
york
central
traffic
vice
president
said,
"when
do
you
expect
to
have
new
haven
in?"
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
in
if
ever
assumed
you
consummate
because
who
knows
at
the
least,
the
bankruptcy
problems
they've
got,
the
problem
of
whether
they
even
had
a
vote
to
the
creditors.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
can
work
it
out.
get
some
great
new
york
law
firms
who
are
contending
that
without
a
vote
of
the
creditors
who
might
prefer
to
take
another
route
to
--
they
can't
work
it
on
that's
being
litigated
now
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
these
problems
were
all
laid
up
in
the
district
court
and
here's
the
point
the
district
court
was
unanimous
on.
the
district
court
did
not
decide
this
on
the
new
haven
problem,
either
the
delay
or
the
risk.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
administrative
law,
you'd
think
that
when
the
district
court
unanimously
rejected
the
decisive
ground
on
which
the
commission
puts
this
that'd
be
the
end
of
the
case.
it's
a
cheney
doctrine.
you
got
to
uphold
the
commission
order
on
the
ground
stated
by
the
commission
or
you
not
uphold
it
all.
it
should've
been
sent
back
to
them.
the
district
court
went
on.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
it's
in
this
court
despite
that
unanimous
holding
below
that
the
appellees
are
saying
that
we
want
this
court
to
hold
--
to
let
penn-central
go
through
right
away
because
of
the
new
haven
problem.
now,
what
is
the
new
haven
problem?
the
problem
is
as
they
say
it,
this
merger
is
going
to
fall
apart.
there'll
be
no
place
to
put
the
new
haven.
that's
what
this
case
now
comes
down
to.
this
court
has
to
believe
in
effect
that
penn
and
central,
they
don't
really
want
this
merger
very
badly.
they're
willing
to
do
it
for
the
public
interest
to
have
a
place
for
new
haven
but
have
left
to
themselves
they
just
soon
walk
away
and
leave
the
whole
thing
if
you
--
if
they're
made
to
wait
any
longer.
now
this
is
nonsense
for
reasons
that
we've
given
some
details.
major
railroad
mergers
were
far
less
saving
the
needs
if
held
together
much
longer.
and
the
glue
that
keeps
penn-central
stuck
together
is
the
fact
that
whenever
they
get
these
problems
resolved
they
got
$81
million
a
year
or
maybe
$120
million,
there's
evidence
to
that
effect.
but
at
least
$81
million
a
year
in
savings,
that's
what
keeps
the
stock
together.
quite
apart
from
an
addition
to
all
the
service
benefits
that
will
crack
out
of
business.
only
last
july,
july
of
1966
these
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
stockholders
voted
99.9,
99.2
respectively
percent
of
those
voting,
or
87%
of
all
stocks
to
reaffirm
these
merger
subject
to
all
these
conditions
and
despite
the
fact
that
--
be
these
delays
and
get
any
saving.
but
why
did
they
do
that?
well
even
with
their
improved
earnings
of
$120
million
a
year
this
merger
is
going
to
increase
their
earnings
about
two-thirds
to
a
double.
here
you're
owning
stock
in
a
company
that's
earning
about
550
a
share
and
these
merger
savings
alone
are
going
to
give
you
another
$3.50
to
$5
of
shared
earnings.
of
course
they
are
going
to
hold
together.
of
course
they
want
it.
and
i
might
also
add
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
before
the
commission
on
this
whole
scare
tactic
of
falling
apart.
no
evidence
whatever
for
the
commission
on
this
september
16th
report.
the
only
evidence
that
has
come
in
lately
and
n
&
w
has
been
denied
the
opportunity
even
to
rebut
it.
so
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
it.
this
is
all
something
that
you're
asked
to
believe
that
penn-central
is
just
going
to
come
apart
with
all
these
attractions
ultimately.
it's
just
going
to
fall
apart
before
your
very
own
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
sir.
in
the
nickel
plate
-
norfolk
and
western
there
was
a
six-year
limit
put
in
at
the
insistence
of
pennsylvania.
in
this
penn-central
agreement
there
is
no
time
limit.
penn-central
is
as
fragile
as
everybody
in
this
side
says
it
is,
it
can't
be
as
good
as
everybody's
been
led
to
believe.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
n
&
w
in
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
these
railroads
have
a
double
interest
on
these.
we
have
a
double
interest
in
it
and
i'm
counsel
for
n
&
w
and
i'll
tell
you
exactly
what
our
double
interest
is.
one
of
them
is
that
were
parties
to
a
fraternity
suit
that's
going
on.
we
got
two
ways
in
which
erie,
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
are
going
to
be
part
of
an
n
&
w
system.
commission
found
that
that
was
our
interest.
we
want
to
have
a
balanced
system
in
the
east.
we're
going
to
be
stuck
with
these
railroads
in
some
form
or
another
we
think.
and
we're
very
much
concerned
with
what
happens
to
them.
but
we
have
a
very
great
interest
quite
apart
from
our
obligations
ever
to
take
these
railroads
on.
n
&
w
in
effect
is
at
the
crossroads
in
this
business.
it's
been
a
coal
carrier
which
isn't
a
rail
competitor
with
anything.
it
was
owned
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
now
was
cut
loose
with
the
nickel
plate
and
the
wabash.
we
are
just
emerging
as
a
competitive
rail
carrier
in
the
east
and
by
competitive,
i
mean
from
merchandised
traffic.
the
question
we
face
is
whether
we're
going
to
go
back
to
holding
coal
and
have
penn-central
dominating
the
east
which
they
would
under
this
--
to
no
we
are
headed
or
whether
we're
going
to
be
a
competitive
factor
for
merchandised
traffic
in
the
east
whether
we're
going
to
be
in
the
balanced
competition
or
whether
we're
just
not
going
to
be
in
the
team
at
all.
that
is
our
critical
interest
within
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
goes
--
i
don't
think
it
goes
quite
that
far.
its
true
that
if
we
wanted
to
force
the
hand
of
the
commission
and
just
wanted
to
get
into
n
&
w
seeing
all
through,
maybe
the
best
thing
for
us
would
be
to
let
penn-central
go
through
right
now.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
were
controlled.
we
were
--
we're
--
we
were
owned
by
pennsylvania
railroad.
they
were
all
over
our
board
and
over
our
executive
committee.
nobody
in
n
&
w
could
have
gone
down
there
and
entered
an
(inaudible)
all
--
what
we
did
--
what
n
&
w
did
the
first
crack
out
of
the
box
right
after
the
examiner's
report
where
they
said,
"well,
you're
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what's
happened
to
turn
us
loose
is
that
its
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
is
part
of
the
three-system
plan
which
the
pennsylvania
sponsored
in
its
proposing
were
to
be
one
of
the
three
systems
were
to
be
half
to
their
side.
and
that
part
--
as
part
of
the
--
of
a
move
to
create
that
system
they
cut
us
loose.
that's
how
we
got
through.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
could've
done
something,
yes
sir.
and
they
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
were
in
this
position
as
we
are
now,
state
the
--
the
parallel
situation
of
n
&
w
and
that
also.
we
were
in
the
position
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
in
examiner's
reports.
we
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
against
improved
service.
we
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
against
savings.
what
we
don't
want
to
do
is
say,
"well,
let's
have
penn-central
it
will
produce
all
that",
and
how
do
we
solve
the
problems,
well
like
the
examiner
said
the
rest
of
the
east
is
somehow
got
to
get
along
together
and
cooperate
and
we
tried
to
work
out
a
plan
which
were
--
still
hoping
to
get
the
hearing.
hearings
are
set
now
after
a
years
delay.
we
undertook
to
try
and
work
out
the
other
half
of
the
east
so
it
could
live
with
penn-central.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
this
is
a
matter
that's
common
in
n
&
w.
n
&
w
and
c
&
o
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
are
merger
partners
in
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
--
excuse
me.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
feel
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
b
&
o
and
c
&
o?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
b
&
o
and
c
&
o
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
n
&
w
and
three
lines
was
found
to
have
benefits
and
service,
benefits
in
savings
and
not
to
hurt
another
soul
in
the
east
and
was
to
gain
those
benefits
and
pennsylvania
permitted
that
because
it
was
part
of
a
three-system
need.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
was
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we've
been
trying
to
get
a
hearing
since
october
1965
on
whether
our
plan
of
a
balanced
system
is
in
the
public
interest.
that
has
been
opposed
by
pennsylvania.
we
have
now
on
--
december
30th
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
now
gotten
an
order
setting
ours
down
for
a
hearing.
so
that's
moving
also.
that
one's
under
way.
we'll
serve
the
evidence
this
winter
and
have
it
by
this
spring.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
didn't
comport
with
the
pennsylvania
plan
for
a
three
system
in
the
east
which
they
were
dominating.
i
asked
mr.
--
the
penn
board
chairman,
i
say,
“do
you
still
oppose
even
letting
n
&
w
seeing
--
will
have
a
hearing
and
whether
there
poses
in
the
public
interest.
it
sure
does.
he
opposes
even
the
hearing.
so
it
departs
from
the
penn
plan.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
we
think
that
the
way
to
get
off
the
benefit
and
the
balance
competition
which
is
the
trip.
and
if
you're
going
to
let
penn
go
through
with
territory
wide
system
with
half
the
east
we
think
that
the
--
an
alternative
should
be
explored
is
a
n
&
w-c
&
o
c
as
the
nucleus
for
the
other
half
of
the
east
to
survive
balanced
competition.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
erie,
d
&
h,
b
&
m,
central,
new
jersey
and
(inaudible).
or
would
do
--
it'd
be
the
other
half
as
shown
in
our
maps
at
two
--
our
maps
b
and
c,
the
other
of
the
east,
so-called
unprotected
carriers.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
and
we've
offered
to
do
that
and
we
think
we
can
do
it
because
with
the
strength
and
the
competitive
balance
that
would
give
us,
we
could
do
it.
we've
afford
to
do
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
that's
the
area
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
it
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
what
it
would
do
your
honor,
it
would
require
n
&
w
as
it
presently
exist
that
the
present
n
&
w
would
require
to
take
in
erie
and
d
&
h.
it
would
not
require
to
take
in
boston
and
maine.
if
boston
and
maine,
it
says,
we
--
they
couldn't
work
out
terms
that
should
go
to
penn-central.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
that's
the
report
in
which
they
say,
let
that
go
to
penn-central.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
ask
this
court
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
our
position
is
first,
that
there
are
number
of
findings
with
respect
to
material
issues
which
weren't
made
but
basically
is
that
section
5
(2)
of
the
act,
this
is
a
statutory
argument.
section
5
(2)
in
the
act
says,
“that
transactions
as
conditioned
by
the
commission
shall
be
appraised,
decide
whether
those
transactions
as
conditioned
are
in
the
public
interest”.
we
say
it
as
a
matter
of
applying
that
statute
and
so
you
know
the
essential
terms
of
the
transaction,
you
don't
know
what
you're
approving.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
where
in
this
case,
they
have
found
that
the
essential
conditions
and
this
is
their
finding
that
they're
essential
not
