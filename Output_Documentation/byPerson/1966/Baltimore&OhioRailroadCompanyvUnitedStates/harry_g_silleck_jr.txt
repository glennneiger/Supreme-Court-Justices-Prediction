mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
for
the
delaware
and
hudson
railroad
corporation,
appellant
in
number
680.
it
has
been
stated
by
the
commission
in
its
brief
that
the
truly
unique
feature
of
this
case
is
a
fact
that
there
is
no
outright
opposition
to
the
merger
by
any
railroad
and
language
to
this
general
effect
appears
in
judge
friendly's
opinion
below.
the
impression
that
this
creates
is
that
conditions
which
other
railroads
have
requested
are
perhaps
of
a
collateral
and
certainly
relatively
unimportant
nature.
that
is
a
very
wrong
impression
about
this
case
because
the
truly
unique
feature
about
it
is
not
the
fact
that
there's
been
no
outright
opposition
by
another
railroad.
the
truly
unique
feature
is
the
reason
why
there
has
been
no
outright
opposition.
and
that
reason
is
this,
in
the
three
merger
cases
that
we
had
have
in
the
east
so
far,
c
&
o,
b
&
o,
and
the
n
&
w-nickel
plate,
penn-central.
there
has
been
a
remarkably
constructive
approach
by
the
management
so
the
other
railroads
affect
it.
they
have
not
as
in
other
parts
of
the
country
sat
back
and
said,
“no,
we
oppose
and
flatly
will
obstruct
any
merger".
they
have
not
as
they
might
have
done
all
sought
inclusion
in
penn-central
at
the
same
time
thereby
creating
even
more
of
a
dilemma
for
the
commission
than
it
now
have.
what
they
did
was
to
seek
to
work
out
a
rational
approach
to
the
whole
merger
picture
in
the
east
realizing
that
mergers
was
desirable
as
a
matter
of
the
economics
of
the
industry,
realizing
further
that
the
policy
of
the
law
supports
and
wishes
to
facilitate
rail
mergers.
now
that
is
where
the
matter
of
conditions
come
in.
how
to
advance
the
railroad
merger
movement
without
obstruction
and
without
real
injury
to
essential
railroads?
now,
it's
been
said
already
as
you
know
that
the
commission
has
found
that
these
three
so-called
“protected
roads,
e-l
and
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
are
essential
in
public
interest.
their
service
must
be
preserved.
they
further
found
that
without
inclusion
in
one
of
the
systems
they
could
not
withstand
or
it
was
doubtful
that
they
could
withstand
competition
in
penn-central.
they
further
said
there
were
only
two
ways
they
could
see
to
protect
them.
one
was
by
inclusion
and
the
other
by
some
interim
protective
conditions
until
they
finally
decided
in
which
system
they
should
be
included.
now,
the
injury
to
the
d
&
h
is
so
well
documented
before
the
commission
and
i
don't
really
have
to
go
into
it
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
one
point
in
connection
with
that.
the
d
&
h
is
a
perfectly
buyable
railroad
on
its
own
today.
it
has
been
a
profit
making
railroad
for
many
years.
what
is
the
trouble
in
this
merger
situation
so
far
as
d
&
h
is
concern
is
penn-central
and
penn-central
only?
we
had
no
cause
to
complain
about
the
other
two
mergers.
but
penn-central
would
as
the
commission
found
make
it
impossible
in
all
likelihood
for
d
&
h
to
survive
as
an
independent
road.
and
d
&
h
is
the
key
to
further
continuance
of
rail
competition
in
new
england
because
it
provide
the
connection
with
the
roads
to
its
west
and
south
with
the
boston
and
maine
which
is
the
only
railroad
that
will
be
left
of
any
significance
to
provide
competition
in
new
england.
now,
we
have
said
to
the
commission,
"yes,
we
would
like
to
have
inclusion
if
we
can".
but
we've
also
said
if
you
think
you
can
find
conditions
that
really
will
protect
us
in
the
interim
we'll
go
along
with
that
but
we've
got
to
be
sure
that
the
conditions
are
satisfactory
because
as
you
yourself
have
found.
you
would
not
let
this
merger
go
to
consummation
unless
there
is
protection.
now,
i
can't
think
of
a
clearer
way
for
the
commission
to
have
found
that
this
kind
of
protected
condition
or
the
condition
precedent
to
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
and
being
a
condition
precedent
and
being
also
as
they
found
in
the
september
16
report
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
hearing
with
respect
to
these
conditions.
it
seems
to
me
essential
as
a
matter
of
principles
of
administrative
law
that
that
hearing
must
be
held
first
before
the
merger
goes
through.
and
now
with
respect
to
these
conditions,
there
are
two
difficulties.
one
relates
to
the
recession
of
the
indemnity.
the
indemnification
provision
as
we
viewed
it
was
inadequate
but
nevertheless
it
did
provide
substantial
protection
in
addition
to
the
so-called
traffic
restrictions.
the
commission
by
rescinding
that
has
as
judge
weinfeld
dissenting
below
said,
undermined
its
whole
finding
that
undelayed
consummation
of
the
merger
was
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
it
does
no
good
to
say
that
these
conditions
may
be
retroactively
reinstated.
the
point
is
they
may
not
be
retroactively
reinstated.
we
do
not
know
until
the
commission
finishes
the
task
of
coming
up
with
these
conditions
and
is
able
to
itself
way
the
significance
of
those
conditions
against
the
desirability
on
other
grounds
for
going
ahead
with
the
merger.
in
that
connection,
it
is
important
to
realize
as
judge
friendly's
opinion
makes
clear
below
that
the
court
below
was
of
the
view
that
if
we
didn't
even
get
the
indemnity
provisions,
the
traffic
conditions
would
probably
be
sufficient.
and
that
was
a
view
which
was
undoubtedly
concluded
by
the
court
below
in
the
light
of
what
was
said
by
the
penn-central
people
in
the
court
below.
now,
what
they
said
was
that
these
conditions
are
very
broad,
very
extensive.
you
could
not
even
devise
a
restraining
order
that
would
be
even
--
that
would
be
anymore
prohibitive
on
their
conduct.
they
said
we
simply
will
not
be
able
to
improve
our
service.
we
cannot
divert
any
traffic
from
these
three
roads.
so,
the
traffic
conditions
on
there
face
as
construed
in
the
court
below
would
appear
and
that
certainly
the
court
below
was
impressed
by
this
would
appear
to
provide
sufficient
protection
with
the
matter
of
indemnity
being
perhaps
a
box
stop
as
they
call
it.
but
the
trouble
is
that
in
the
hearings
that
if
the
just
recently
been
concluded
a
totally
different
interpretation
has
been
placed
on
those
conditions
by
the
pennsylvania's
own
witness.
when
i
say
that,
i
do
not
in
any
sense
mean
to
charge
either
counsel
or
the
witness
with
an
attempt
to
mislead
either
the
court
or
the
commission.
the
difficulty
stems
from
the
facts
that
these
conditions
despite
their
apparent
clarity
are
not
clear
at
all.
what
has
happened
is
this,
the
pennsylvania
witness
in
these
further
hearings
has
said,
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
counsel
that
was
expressed
below,
he
has
said,
"we
will
not
be
banned
as
i
read
these
conditions
from
soliciting
traffic
for
penn-central
against
the
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h
and
d
&
m.
we
won't
be
banned
from
soliciting
traffic
and
conjunction
with
our
future
partner
the
new
haven
against
these
three
roads
despite
the
fact
that
judge
friendly
very
clearly
in
the
court
below
was
interested
in
this
matter
of
solicitation.
i
have
quoted
in
out
reply
brief
the
good
portion
of
the
record
to
show
what
was
said
there
and
to
show
what
judge
friendly's
interest
in
this
matter
was.
what
we
have
in
other
words
today
is
the
unhappy
situation
of
a
very
unclear
set
of
traffic
conditions
requiring
it
nothing
else,
a
clarification
by
the
commission
as
a
result
of
this
further
hearing
which
was
recently
concluded.
we
have
at
the
most
only
a
possibility
of
getting
an
indemnity
provision.
we
know
we
have
some
questions
raised
which
i
like
--
mr.
bourne
do
not
agree
with
but
nevertheless
questions
have
been
raised
by
the
n
&
w,
b
&
o,
c
&o
group
as
to
the
legality
of
such
conditions.
it
does
not
seem
under
these
circumstances
possible
to
me
for
anyone
to
conclude
that
the
conditions
which
we
will
have
in
effect
if
this
merger
were
to
go
through
tomorrow
would
be
in
any
sense
adequate
to
protect
us.
and
it
is
on
that
ground
principally
the
delaware
and
hudson
relied
so
far
as
the
reversal
of
the
court
below
is
concern.
we
think
this
proceeding
is
in
the
state
where
remand
is
required
at
least
until
the
commission
had
issued
its
decision
on
these
conditions
so
that
the
parties
can
determine
whether
or
not
they
merely
have
any
protection.
whether
the
commission
itself
--
so
that
the
commission
itself,
i
should
say
can
determine
the
significance
of
those
conditions
as
finally
determined
in
the
light
of
the
other
considerations
which
they
think
lead
to
the
desirability
of
undelayed
consummation.
now
in
that
connection,
judge
friendly
referred
below
through
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
to
avoid
prejudgment.
i
fully
agree,
i
think
that
a
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
body
must
avoid
prejudgment.
therefore
it
must
not
determine
that
these
conditions
that
are
in
existence
today
are
adequate
until
they
have
heard
the
evidence
and
heard
the
arguments
about
the
evidence
and
they've
reached
a
conclusion
in
that
light.
in
that
respect
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
another
difficulty
with
the
commission's
report
of
september
16
as
we
see
it.
the
commission
in
that
report
laid
out
as
it
thought
the
factors
alongside
and
the
other
on
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
merger.
and
among
of
those
factors
was
the
thought
that
because
a
delay
and
the
merger
might
delay
the
ultimate
accomplishment
of
savings
and
benefits
to
the
public,
the
merger
ought
not
to
be
delay
because
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
benefit
to
the
public
ultimately
from
this
merger.
the
difficulty
is
again,
that
until
we
know
what
appendix
g
conditions,
traffic
conditions
really
mean
for
penn-central
you
cannot
determine
whether
--
a
days
delayed
now
with
appendix
g
in
operation
is
any
worse
to
the
penn-central
than
delay
of
the
merger
entirely
until
these
conditions
are
finally
determined.
in
that
connection,
i
would
simply
point
out
this
as
an
example.
the
penn-central
in
their
briefs
said
what
they
thought
the
commission
meant
by
this
talk
about
the
days
delay
at
the
beginning,
being
days
delay
at
the
end
was
that
capital
improvement
programs
by
penn-central
could
at
least
be
initiated
during
the
period
of
appendix
g
was
in
effect
and
if
this
would
necessarily
hasten
in
the
long
run
the
benefits
to
the
public
which
the
merger
would
permit.
that
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
problem
that
is
involved
in
these
appendix
g
conditions.
if
as
the
pennsylvania's
traffic
witness
construed
them
in
these
recent
hearing
as
not
in
effect
prohibiting
construction
of
new
facilities
on
the
lines
of
the
present
penn
or
the
lines
of
the
present
central
just
so
long
as
you
didn't
use
both
lines
for
your
new
facilities.
if
that's
what
appendix
g
really
means
then
of
course
they'll
begin
their
capital
improvement
program.
but
that
very
situation
will
deprive
us
of
what
little
protection
the
traffic
conditions
will
afford.
the
principal
thing
that
we
are
worried
about
is
the
const
--
or
a
principal
thing
is
the
construction
of
a
yard
at
selkirk,
new
york
right
on
the
d
&
h
doorstep
which
will
be
the
focal
point
for
the
handling
of
all
traffic
moving
east
and
west
over
this
new
penn-central
system.
now,
if
they
are
allowed
to
build
that
yard
for
dimensions
for
ultimate
use
by
penn-central
which
under
the
pennsylvania
witness'
interpretation
as
i
understand
that
they
would
do.
all
of
the
traffic
that
we
are
worrying
about
that
would
move
through
that
yard
and
take
traffic
away
from
us
or
the
advantages
of
having
it
move
it
through
that
yard
would
accrue
even
while
this
appendix
g
conditions
were
in
effect
assuming
that
we
never
included
before
the
yard
is
finished.
now,
if
on
the
other
--
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
selkirk,
new
york.
it's
near
albany.
and
it's
the
--
is
the
point
where
the
new
york
central's
lines
from
new
york
city
to
albany,
from
boston
to
albany,
and
from
the
west
to
albany
all
converge.
if
on
the
other
hand
appendix
g
has
any
real
teeth
in
it
and
means
what
we
thought
the
commission
thought
it
was
suppose
to
mean
then
we
doubt
very
seriously
that
penn-central
would
construct
to
any
substantial
degree
a
large
of
these
additional
facilities
because
until
they
know
how
long
appendix
g
is
going
to
be
in
effect.
it
would
probably
be
against
there
interest
to
construct
facilities
and
then
have
to
let
them
lie
idle
until
appendix
g
went
off
and
they
could
use
it.
so,
the
principle
problem
at
the
moment
is
getting
far
--
a
far
as
to
what
appendix
g
means.
i'm
getting
assurance
as
to
whether
there
is
to
be
anything
in
addition
to
traffic
conditions.
now
it
may
well
be
that
when
we
see
those
conditions,
we
would
be
reasonably
satisfied.
we
would
go
along
and
say,
"yes,
we'll
work
with
this
until
our
own
inclusion
is
effective".
but
until
we
know
what
they
are,
until
the
commission
itself
and
my
judgment
knows
what
they
mean
we
cannot
take
that
chance
in
the
light
of
their
own
findings
and
their
own
findings
as
i
said
before
are
completely
documented
by
the
record.
the
difficulty
with
traffic
conditions
i
might
say
is
recognized
really
by
all
the
people
really
associated
in
the
traffic
business.
i
might
refer
for
instance
to
the
testimony
of
the
traffic
vice
president
of
the
new
haven
railroad
in
this
proceeding
some
years
back
before
we
knew
what
these
conditions
were.
but
at
that
time
the
new
haven
was
putting
in
its
case
to
show
the
real
harm
penn-central
would
cause
to
it.
and
he
said,
"i
know
of
no
conditions
which
the
commission
could
impose
which
could
in
any
way
prevent
the
diversion
of
traffic
to
which
i
have
testified".
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
would
say
that
quite
that
strongly
if
he
knew
at
the
time
that
these
conditions
were
in
line.
but
it
does
show
that
the
novelty
of
these
conditions.
the
untried
character
of
these
conditions
and
at
this
point,
the
completely
unclear
nature
of
the
conditions
in
concrete
application
justified
the
very
real
concern
as
judge
--
as
--
is
apparent
from
what
we
have
said
in
the
brief
that
we
do
not
believe
that
anyone
can
say
that
these
conditions
provide
adequate
protection
which
the
commission
by
its
own
finding
that
it
said
its
absolutely
necessary
to
undelayed
consummation
of
the
merger.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
for
the
delaware
and
hudson
railroad
corporation,
appellant
in
number
680.
it
has
been
stated
by
the
commission
in
its
brief
that
the
truly
unique
feature
of
this
case
is
a
fact
that
there
is
no
outright
opposition
to
the
merger
by
any
railroad
and
language
to
this
general
effect
appears
in
judge
friendly's
opinion
below.
the
impression
that
this
creates
is
that
conditions
which
other
railroads
have
requested
are
perhaps
of
a
collateral
and
certainly
relatively
unimportant
nature.
that
is
a
very
wrong
impression
about
this
case
because
the
truly
unique
feature
about
it
is
not
the
fact
that
there's
been
no
outright
opposition
by
another
railroad.
the
truly
unique
feature
is
the
reason
why
there
has
been
no
outright
opposition.
and
that
reason
is
this,
in
the
three
merger
cases
that
we
had
have
in
the
east
so
far,
c
&

&
o,
and
the
n
&
w-nickel
plate,
penn-central.
there
has
been
a
remarkably
constructive
approach
by
the
management
so
the
other
railroads
affect
it.
they
have
not
as
in
other
parts
of
the
country
sat
back
and
said,
“no,
we
oppose
and
flatly
will
obstruct
any
merger".
they
have
not
as
they
might
have
done
all
sought
inclusion
in
penn-central
at
the
same
time
thereby
creating
even
more
of
a
dilemma
for
the
commission
than
it
now
have.
what
they
did
was
to
seek
to
work
out
a
rational
approach
to
the
whole
merger
picture
in
the
east
realizing
that
mergers
was
desirable
as
a
matter
of
the
economics
of
the
industry,
realizing
further
that
the
policy
of
the
law
supports
and
wishes
to
facilitate
rail
mergers.
now
that
is
where
the
matter
of
conditions
come
in.
how
to
advance
the
railroad
merger
movement
without
obstruction
and
without
real
injury
to
essential
railroads?
now,
it's
been
said
already
as
you
know
that
the
commission
has
found
that
these
three
so-called
“protected
roads,
e-l
and
d
&
h
and
b
&
m
are
essential
in
public
interest.
their
service
must
be
preserved.
they
further
found
that
without
inclusion
in
one
of
the
systems
they
could
not
withstand
or
it
was
doubtful
that
they
could
withstand
competition
in
penn-central.
they
further
said
there
were
only
two
ways
they
could
see
to
protect
them.
one
was
by
inclusion
and
the
other
by
some
interim
protective
conditions
until
they
finally
decided
in
which
system
they
should
be
included.
now,
the
injury
to
the
d
&
h
is
so
well
documented
before
the
commission
and
i
don't
really
have
to
go
into
it
but
i
would
like
to
make
this
one
point
in
connection
with
that.
the
d
&
h
is
a
perfectly
buyable
railroad
on
its
own
today.
it
has
been
a
profit
making
railroad
for
many
years.
what
is
the
trouble
in
this
merger
situation
so
far
as
d
&
h
is
concern
is
penn-central
and
penn-central
only?
we
had
no
cause
to
complain
about
the
other
two
mergers.
but
penn-central
would
as
the
commission
found
make
it
impossible
in
all
likelihood
for
d
&
h
to
survive
as
an
independent
road.
and
d
&
h
is
the
key
to
further
continuance
of
rail
competition
in
new
england
because
it
provide
the
connection
with
the
roads
to
its
west
and
south
with
the
boston
and
maine
which
is
the
only
railroad
that
will
be
left
of
any
significance
to
provide
competition
in
new
england.
now,
we
have
said
to
the
commission,
"yes,
we
would
like
to
have
inclusion
if
we
can".
but
we've
also
said
if
you
think
you
can
find
conditions
that
really
will
protect
us
in
the
interim
we'll
go
along
with
that
but
we've
got
to
be
sure
that
the
conditions
are
satisfactory
because
as
you
yourself
have
found.
you
would
not
let
this
merger
go
to
consummation
unless
there
is
protection.
now,
i
can't
think
of
a
clearer
way
for
the
commission
to
have
found
that
this
kind
of
protected
condition
or
the
condition
precedent
to
the
consummation
of
the
merger.
and
being
a
condition
precedent
and
being
also
as
they
found
in
the
september
16
report
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
hearing
with
respect
to
these
conditions.
it
seems
to
me
essential
as
a
matter
of
principles
of
administrative
law
that
that
hearing
must
be
held
first
before
the
merger
goes
through.
and
now
with
respect
to
these
conditions,
there
are
two
difficulties.
one
relates
to
the
recession
of
the
indemnity.
the
indemnification
provision
as
we
viewed
it
was
inadequate
but
nevertheless
it
did
provide
substantial
protection
in
addition
to
the
so-called
traffic
restrictions.
the
commission
by
rescinding
that
has
as
judge
weinfeld
dissenting
below
said,
undermined
its
whole
finding
that
undelayed
consummation
of
the
merger
was
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
and
it
does
no
good
to
say
that
these
conditions
may
be
retroactively
reinstated.
the
point
is
they
may
not
be
retroactively
reinstated.
we
do
not
know
until
the
commission
finishes
the
task
of
coming
up
with
these
conditions
and
is
able
to
itself
way
the
significance
of
those
conditions
against
the
desirability
on
other
grounds
for
going
ahead
with
the
merger.
in
that
connection,
it
is
important
to
realize
as
judge
friendly's
opinion
makes
clear
below
that
the
court
below
was
of
the
view
that
if
we
didn't
even
get
the
indemnity
provisions,
the
traffic
conditions
would
probably
be
sufficient.
and
that
was
a
view
which
was
undoubtedly
concluded
by
the
court
below
in
the
light
of
what
was
said
by
the
penn-central
people
in
the
court
below.
now,
what
they
said
was
that
these
conditions
are
very
broad,
very
extensive.
you
could
not
even
devise
a
restraining
order
that
would
be
even
--
that
would
be
anymore
prohibitive
on
their
conduct.
they
said
we
simply
will
not
be
able
to
improve
our
service.
we
cannot
divert
any
traffic
from
these
three
roads.
so,
the
traffic
conditions
on
there
face
as
construed
in
the
court
below
would
appear
and
that
certainly
the
court
below
was
impressed
by
this
would
appear
to
provide
sufficient
protection
with
the
matter
of
indemnity
being
perhaps
a
box
stop
as
they
call
it.
but
the
trouble
is
that
in
the
hearings
that
if
the
just
recently
been
concluded
a
totally
different
interpretation
has
been
placed
on
those
conditions
by
the
pennsylvania's
own
witness.
when
i
say
that,
i
do
not
in
any
sense
mean
to
charge
either
counsel
or
the
witness
with
an
attempt
to
mislead
either
the
court
or
the
commission.
the
difficulty
stems
from
the
facts
that
these
conditions
despite
their
apparent
clarity
are
not
clear
at
all.
what
has
happened
is
this,
the
pennsylvania
witness
in
these
further
hearings
has
said,
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
counsel
that
was
expressed
below,
he
has
said,
"we
will
not
be
banned
as
i
read
these
conditions
from
soliciting
traffic
for
penn-central
against
the
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h
and
d
&
m.
we
won't
be
banned
from
soliciting
traffic
and
conjunction
with
our
future
partner
the
new
haven
against
these
three
roads
despite
the
fact
that
judge
friendly
very
clearly
in
the
court
below
was
interested
in
this
matter
of
solicitation.
i
have
quoted
in
out
reply
brief
the
good
portion
of
the
record
to
show
what
was
said
there
and
to
show
what
judge
friendly's
interest
in
this
matter
was.
what
we
have
in
other
words
today
is
the
unhappy
situation
of
a
very
unclear
set
of
traffic
conditions
requiring
it
nothing
else,
a
clarification
by
the
commission
as
a
result
of
this
further
hearing
which
was
recently
concluded.
we
have
at
the
most
only
a
possibility
of
getting
an
indemnity
provision.
we
know
we
have
some
questions
raised
which
i
like
--
mr.
bourne
do
not
agree
with
but
nevertheless
questions
have
been
raised
by
the
n
&
w,
b
&
o,
c
&o
group
as
to
the
legality
of
such
conditions.
it
does
not
seem
under
these
circumstances
possible
to
me
for
anyone
to
conclude
that
the
conditions
which
we
will
have
in
effect
if
this
merger
were
to
go
through
tomorrow
would
be
in
any
sense
adequate
to
protect
us.
and
it
is
on
that
ground
principally
the
delaware
and
hudson
relied
so
far
as
the
reversal
of
the
court
below
is
concern.
we
think
this
proceeding
is
in
the
state
where
remand
is
required
at
least
until
the
commission
had
issued
its
decision
on
these
conditions
so
that
the
parties
can
determine
whether
or
not
they
merely
have
any
protection.
whether
the
commission
itself
--
so
that
the
commission
itself,
i
should
say
can
determine
the
significance
of
those
conditions
as
finally
determined
in
the
light
of
the
other
considerations
which
they
think
lead
to
the
desirability
of
undelayed
consummation.
now
in
that
connection,
judge
friendly
referred
below
through
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
to
avoid
prejudgment.
i
fully
agree,
i
think
that
a
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
body
must
avoid
prejudgment.
therefore
it
must
not
determine
that
these
conditions
that
are
in
existence
today
are
adequate
until
they
have
heard
the
evidence
and
heard
the
arguments
about
the
evidence
and
they've
reached
a
conclusion
in
that
light.
in
that
respect
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
another
difficulty
with
the
commission's
report
of
september
16
as
we
see
it.
the
commission
in
that
report
laid
out
as
it
thought
the
factors
alongside
and
the
other
on
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
merger.
and
among
of
those
factors
was
the
thought
that
because
a
delay
and
the
merger
might
delay
the
ultimate
accomplishment
of
savings
and
benefits
to
the
public,
the
merger
ought
not
to
be
delay
because
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
benefit
to
the
public
ultimately
from
this
merger.
the
difficulty
is
again,
that
until
we
know
what
appendix
g
conditions,
traffic
conditions
really
mean
for
penn-central
you
cannot
determine
whether
--
a
days
delayed
now
with
appendix
g
in
operation
is
any
worse
to
the
penn-central
than
delay
of
the
merger
entirely
until
these
conditions
are
finally
determined.
in
that
connection,
i
would
simply
point
out
this
as
an
example.
the
penn-central
in
their
briefs
said
what
they
thought
the
commission
meant
by
this
talk
about
the
days
delay
at
the
beginning,
being
days
delay
at
the
end
was
that
capital
improvement
programs
by
penn-central
could
at
least
be
initiated
during
the
period
of
appendix
g
was
in
effect
and
if
this
would
necessarily
hasten
in
the
long
run
the
benefits
to
the
public
which
the
merger
would
permit.
that
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
problem
that
is
involved
in
these
appendix
g
conditions.
if
as
the
pennsylvania's
traffic
witness
construed
them
in
these
recent
hearing
as
not
in
effect
prohibiting
construction
of
new
facilities
on
the
lines
of
the
present
penn
or
the
lines
of
the
present
central
just
so
long
as
you
didn't
use
both
lines
for
your
new
facilities.
if
that's
what
appendix
g
really
means
then
of
course
they'll
begin
their
capital
improvement
program.
but
that
very
situation
will
deprive
us
of
what
little
protection
the
traffic
conditions
will
afford.
the
principal
thing
that
we
are
worried
about
is
the
const
--
or
a
principal
thing
is
the
construction
of
a
yard
at
selkirk,
new
york
right
on
the
d
&
h
doorstep
which
will
be
the
focal
point
for
the
handling
of
all
traffic
moving
east
and
west
over
this
new
penn-central
system.
now,
if
they
are
allowed
to
build
that
yard
for
dimensions
for
ultimate
use
by
penn-central
which
under
the
pennsylvania
witness'
interpretation
as
i
understand
that
they
would
do.
all
of
the
traffic
that
we
are
worrying
about
that
would
move
through
that
yard
and
take
traffic
away
from
us
or
the
advantages
of
having
it
move
it
through
that
yard
would
accrue
even
while
this
appendix
g
conditions
were
in
effect
assuming
that
we
never
included
before
the
yard
is
finished.
now,
if
on
the
other
--
mr.
harry
g.
silleck,
jr.
selkirk,
new
york.
it's
near
albany.
and
it's
the
--
is
the
point
where
the
new
york
central's
lines
from
new
york
city
to
albany,
from
boston
to
albany,
and
from
the
west
to
albany
all
converge.
if
on
the
other
hand
appendix
g
has
any
real
teeth
in
it
and
means
what
we
thought
the
commission
thought
it
was
suppose
to
mean
then
we
doubt
very
seriously
that
penn-central
would
construct
to
any
substantial
degree
a
large
of
these
additional
facilities
because
until
they
know
how
long
appendix
g
is
going
to
be
in
effect.
it
would
probably
be
against
there
interest
to
construct
facilities
and
then
have
to
let
them
lie
idle
until
appendix
g
went
off
and
they
could
use
it.
so,
the
principle
problem
at
the
moment
is
getting
far
--
a
far
as
to
what
appendix
g
means.
i'm
getting
assurance
as
to
whether
there
is
to
be
anything
in
addition
to
traffic
conditions.
now
it
may
well
be
that
when
we
see
those
conditions,
we
would
be
reasonably
satisfied.
we
would
go
along
and
say,
"yes,
we'll
work
with
this
until
our
own
inclusion
is
effective".
but
until
we
know
what
they
are,
until
the
commission
itself
and
my
judgment
knows
what
they
mean
we
cannot
take
that
chance
in
the
light
of
their
own
findings
and
their
own
findings
as
i
said
before
are
completely
documented
by
the
record.
the
difficulty
with
traffic
conditions
i
might
say
is
recognized
really
by
all
the
people
really
associated
in
the
traffic
business.
i
might
refer
for
instance
to
the
testimony
of
the
traffic
vice
president
of
the
new
haven
railroad
in
this
proceeding
some
years
back
before
we
knew
what
these
conditions
were.
but
at
that
time
the
new
haven
was
putting
in
its
case
to
show
the
real
harm
penn-central
would
cause
to
it.
and
he
said,
"i
know
of
no
conditions
which
the
commission
could
impose
which
could
in
any
way
prevent
the
diversion
of
traffic
to
which
i
have
testified".
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
would
say
that
quite
that
strongly
if
he
knew
at
the
time
that
these
conditions
were
in
line.
but
it
does
show
that
the
novelty
of
these
conditions.
the
untried
character
of
these
conditions
and
at
this
point,
the
completely
unclear
nature
of
the
conditions
in
concrete
application
justified
the
very
real
concern
as
judge
--
as
--
is
apparent
from
what
we
have
said
in
the
brief
that
we
do
not
believe
that
anyone
can
say
that
these
conditions
provide
adequate
protection
which
the
commission
by
its
own
finding
that
it
said
its
absolutely
necessary
to
undelayed
consummation
of
the
merger.
thank
you.
