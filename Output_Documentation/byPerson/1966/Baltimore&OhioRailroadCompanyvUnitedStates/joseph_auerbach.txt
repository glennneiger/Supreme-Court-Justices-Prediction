mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
may
i
say
on
this
last
point
that
every
plaintiff
below
treated
the
case
below
as
being
a
trial
on
the
merits
for
purposes
of
coming
to
this
court.
one
need
only
to
look
at
their
briefs
to
see
that
there
is
nothing
more
that
they
intend
to
offer
if
this
case
went
down
on
this
issue.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
in
my
argument
to
three
points.
i
must
say
at
the
outset
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
going
to
reach
them
all.
the
first
is
what
is
the
effect
on
the
new
haven
if
this
merger
is
delayed?
the
second
is
to
add
a
few
comments
on
the
historical
perspective
of
this
case,
and
finally,
if
time
permits,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
private
interest
question
versus
the
public
interest
findings
by
the
commission.
before
i
get
in
to
the
substance
of
my
argument,
however,
i
would
request
of
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
trustees,
a
special
procedure
in
this
case.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
issue
its
order
herein,
prior
to
entry
of
its
opinion,
no
matter
what
your
decision
may
be.
i
refer
in
this
connection
to
aaron
versus
cooper
in
358
u.s.,
mesarosh
versus
u.s.
in
352
and
collins
versus
loisel
in
262
and
the
reason
is,
whichever
way
you
decide
this
case,
we
go
to
trial
next
monday
in
new
york
on
a
plan
of
reorganization
that
is
premised
on
this
merger
going
through.
if
this
merger
isn't
going
through,
we're
going
to
waste
additional
assets
of
this
estate
upwards
of
$1
million.
we've
already
been
authorized
sums
of
that
kind
to
prosecute
the
case.
if
you
decide
therefore
that
this
case
cannot
be
decided
in
our
favor
which
is
to
say,
to
quash
this
stay
and
let
the
merger
go
forward,
we've
got
to
consider
as
fiduciaries
whether
we
go
back
to
judge
anderson
and
find
out
whether
any
money
should
be
spent
until
one
knows
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
reorganization.
conversely,
if
you
enter
an
order
which
permits
this
to
go
forward,
we
can
go
forward
with
the
assurance
that
one
day
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
with
the
time
in
question,
but
one
day,
the
new
haven
will
enter
in
its
home
and
that
isn't
the
issue,
is
there
a
home
for
the
new
haven.
going
to
the
substantive
volumes
now
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no
sir.
we're
out
of
time
schedule
now.
well,
let
me
go
back
a
bit
to
explain
why
i
say
that.
the
new
haven
is
the
most
incredible
reorganization
that
any
railroad
or
reorganization
law
has
ever
run
into
and
the
reasons
are
quite
simple.
it's
in
a
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
it
has
to
be
under
that
section,
there's
no
alternative,
but
this
is
a
section
that
never
contemplated
a
railroad
without
income
available
to
pay
fixed
charges.
it's
been
nine
years
that
the
new
haven
has
not
had
income
available
for
fixed
charges.
that
means
just
by
definition,
you
can
never
have
a
capital
structure
for
the
new
haven.
now
what
do
you
do?
you
do
what
the
trustees
have
done
for
five
years
which
is
through
a
combination
of
capitalization
of
the
property,
subsidy
from
the
states,
deferral
of
priority
claims,
i'm
speaking
now
of
real
estate
taxes
and
tort
claims,
deferral
of
all
these
things
meets
your
payroll.
they
have
done
it
for
five
years.
you
can't
go
on
doing
this.
now
this
court
may
decide
just
to
draw
a
complete
conclusion
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
may
decided
that
in
the
overall
public
interest,
the
interest
of
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
delaware
and
hudson,
outweigh
the
benefits
to
the
public
from
preserving
the
new
haven.
i
don't
say
you
can't
decide
that.
the
commission
of
course
didn't
decide
that.
they
decided
the
new
haven
was
paramount,
decide
if
you
will
the
opposite
but
if
you
decided,
as
i
said
earlier,
please
enter
your
order
now
because
if
there's
another
meeting
that
can
be
saved
here,
the
trustees
ought
to
save
it.
the
new
haven's
concern
with
the
delay
in
consummation
is
two-fold.
until
the
merger
is
consummated,
the
merger
is
exposed
to
the
risk
that
will
never
be
a
merger.
and
if
it
never
will
be
a
merger,
we
don't
have
a
home
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
this
and
show
the
findings
that
have
been
made
in
that
respect.
the
second
point
is,
until
it
is
consummated,
the
new
haven's
ability
to
continue
to
finance
this,
if
you
will,
ridiculous
financial
situation
is
completely
nullified
but
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
we
know
there
is
a
place
where
the
new
haven
can
go.
we
know
that
because
the
commission
has
absolutely
provided
as
a
condition
that
they
must
take
the
new
haven.
now,
i'm
not
concerned
whether
the
terms
which
the
trustees
have
negotiated
and
i
may
say
this
is
in
a
complete
contract
of
whether
those
terms
of
the
final
terms
and
not
just
in
irrelevancy
because
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
the
new
haven
one
day
will
be
taken
and
whatever
terms
those
terms
may
be,
the
new
haven
will
be
taken.
that
means
that
during
the
interim
period
whether
these
trustees
or
some
other
trustees
run
this
estate,
they
can
go
to
banks,
they
can
go
to
the
states,
they
can
say,
here
is
what
it's
going
to
cost,
here
is
the
reasonable
period
of
time
required,
but
if
you
don't
know
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
merger,
if
this
court
merely
sense
this
back
for
further
proceedings,
if
we're
faced
with
a
two
to
five
years
that
mr.
ginnane
predicted
and
i
may
say,
i
thought
he
was
perhaps
modest
in
his
predictions.
if
we're
faced
with
that,
we
don't
even
know
where
to
get
the
next
dollar.
now,
i'd
given
you
the
two
reasons
why
a
merger
must
go
forward
so
far
as
the
new
haven
is
concerned.
now,
let
me
explain
to
the
court
if
i
may
why
those
two
concerns
have
a
bearing
on
this
case.
first,
are
the
new
haven's
operations
essential
in
the
public
interest?
well,
the
commission
specifically
found
that
and
in
the
court
below,
judge
winfield
did
not
disagree
with
that.
and
in
fact,
in
the
erie-lackawanna
reply
brief
in
this
case,
the
following
statement
is
made
at
page
21.
the
importance
of
preserving
the
new
haven
is
not
disputed.
none
of
them
disputes
that.
the
erie-lackawanna
brief
goes
on,
the
question
is,
is
it
necessary
because
of
the
new
haven
to
put
erie-lackawanna,
d&h
and
b&m
in
the
most
serious
jeopardy
in
order
to
have
a
consummation.
i
think
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
question.
i'm
prepared
to
show
the
court
today
that
they
are
not
put
in
jeopardy
because
the
protective
conditions
are
adequate
and
proper,
but
even
if
i
accept
the
question
as
put
by
the
erie-lackawanna,
i
would
say
to
the
court,
yes
it
is
necessary.
it
is
necessary
because
the
new
haven
is
essential
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
save
it.
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
does
inclusion
in
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
save
the
new
haven?
answer?
yes.
the
commission
found
specifically
that
and
nobody
disagrees
with
that.
third,
is
there
any
other
possibility
of
saving
the
new
haven?
no.
the
commission
specifically
found
that
and
nobody
disagrees
with
that.
the
commission
said
and
this
is
at
328
i.c.c.
at
312.
absent
the
applicants'
merger,
we
see
no
solution
to
the
new
haven
problem.
certainly,
neither
of
the
applicant
separately
can
be
required
to
take
over
new
haven's
deficit
written
operations.
nobody
disagrees
with
that
finding.
in
fact,
no
one
really
quarrels
with
this
syllogism
i
have
just
been
through.
the
quarrel
comes
on
whether
a
delay
really
exposes
the
new
haven
to
a
risk
that
the
merger
will
abort.
thus,
if
it
aborts,
it
frustrates
completely
the
preservation
of
the
new
haven
and
the
public
interest
in
having
that
railroad
preserved.
so
let's
look
at
the
question,
am
i
over
stating
this
question?
well,
the
risk
that
the
merger
will
abort
was
found
specifically
by
the
commission,
they
addressed
themselves
right
to
this.
they
said,
if
consummation
of
the
applicants'
merger
delayed
several
years
or
indefinitely,
we
can
have
no
assurance
that
it
will
ever
occur.
the
factors
that
enter
to
an
agreement
to
merge
sooner
or
later
can
be
affected
by
changing
conditions.
and
then
they
went
on
to
say,
“we
are
not
prepared
to
take
this
risk
involved
in
a
substantial
postponement
of
consummation
of
the
merger.
moreover
and
this
is
the
language
that
i
would
bring
specifically
to
the
court's
attention,
moreover,
we
are
not
prepared
to
take
the
risks
which
delay
of
consummation
of
even
6
or
12
months
might
entail.”
now,
the
6
or
12
months
was
picked
up
out
of
these
petitions
for
rehearing
file
by
various
of
these
appellants.
and
the
court
was
saying,
“not
even
six
months.”
we
--
the
commission,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
commission
will
say,
“not
even
six
months
will
we
take
this
risk.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
calendar,
four
months
have
already
elapsed
since
september
in
this
--
that
i've
just
read
to
you
was
written.
but
n&w
and
c&o
and
b&o
whose
interest
in
this
case
is
demonstrated
by
their
briefs
and
argument
are
certainly
rather
remote,
but
they
on
one
hand,
in
erie-lackawanna
which
has
a
real
interest
on
the
other
hand,
assure
the
court
that
there
is
no
such
risk
of
an
abortion
here.
mr.
trienens
said
to
the
court
yesterday,
there
is
$81
million
of
glue.
mr.
bourne
in
his
brief
on
behalf
of
erie-lackawanna
says,
the
risk
that
this
would
be
aborted
in
the
near
future
is
and
i
quote
“miniscule”.
now
each
in
its
own
way
either
begs
or
distorts
the
question
that
the
court
must
decide.
the
risk
is
not
that
penn
or
central
voluntarily
with
that
way
as
mr.
cox
just
told
the
court,
of
course
they
won't.
apart
from
that
i
would
agreed
that
$81
million
of
glue
is
a
lot
of
glue,
but
it's
not
the
glue
that's
the
important
thing.
it's,
will
this
merger
abort
in
spite
of
their
desire
to
get
that
$81
million.
that's
the
risk
which
the
new
haven
is
subjected
and
apart
from
the
questions
that
mr.
cox
addressed
himself
to
of
how
do
you
manage,
continue
to
manage
and
a
price
of
this
size
vested
with
the
public
interest
without
knowing
whether
tomorrow
you're
going
to
be
a
combined
company
or
separate
company
without
knowing
what
you
do
about
employees
or
construction
programs
or
orders
for
new
freight
cars
or
building
of
yards.
you
can't
manage
indefinitely
under
those
circumstances.
but
apart
from
that
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no
sir.
if
he
did,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct
because
the
penn-central
has
accepted
the
commission's
order
flatly.
the
commission's
order
gives
the
penn-central
the
same
rights
that
the
new
haven
has
today
to
move
for
changes
in
its
passenger
service
under
the
transportation
act
of
1958.
it
gives
them
no
special
rights
nor
the
states
demand
special
rights.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
not
to
my
knowledge
sir.
as
i
started
to
say,
more
important
than
the
problem
of
corporate
management,
living
without
knowing
what's
going
to
happen,
is
that
no
matter
how
much
they
want
this
merger
to
stick
any
plan,
a
plan
of
reorganization
or
a
merger
plan
which
is
based
upon
a
stock
exchange
ratio
as
mr.
cox
pointed
out
is
particularly
vulnerable.
in
fact,
it
is
almost
too
numerous
to
less.
the
members
of
this
court
know
that
whenever
you
have
a
merger
plan
or
reorganization
plan
based
upon
an
exchange
ratio,
it's
subject
to
vagaries
of
changes
and
circumstances.
what
erie-lackawanna
makes
the
prediction
that
the
likelihood
of
a
change
in
the
near
future
that
is
a
change
in
circumstances
is
minuscule.
it
is
foolhardy
or
naive
in
making
such
a
prediction.
one
thing
is
certain
even
if
it
is
minuscule
and
let's
assume
for
that
purpose
that
it
is,
this
was
a
risk
which
the
commission
refused
to
take.
now,
it
had
to
make
findings
on
both
sides
and
it
did
and
it
refused
to
take
the
risk.
the
appellants
ask
the
court
now
to
take
this
risk.
now
because
you're
being
asked
to
take
the
risk,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
consider
what
the
consequences
of
the
risk
are.
if
this
merger
aborts
as
demonstrated
by
the
syllogism
i
went
through
earlier
the
new
haven
will
be
forced
to
liquidate.
now,
what
does
this
mean?
it
must
first
be
realized
that
if
the
new
haven
liquidates,
service
to
17
million
persons,
that
being
the
population
of
the
service
area
of
the
new
haven
is
adversely
affected.
on
a
daily
basis,
the
new
haven
carries
65,000
of
those
persons
on
its
passenger
trains.on
a
daily
basis,
the
new
haven
now,
brings
in
and
out
of
new
england
60,000
tons
of
freight
and
the
livelihood
as
well
as
the
food
of
persons
depends
--
the
cost
of
food
depends
on
this
kind
of
service.
if
it
were
not
so,
this
would
be
moving
by
some
of
them
right
now.
these
are
the
direct
consequences
of
a
social
and
public
nature.
the
court
may
recall
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
yesterday
of
mr.
trienens
with
respect
to
a
gross
revenues
test
in
determining
importance
of
railroads,
a
table
which
appears
in
his
brief.
let's
just
look
at
that
gross
revenue
test.
in
the
point
of
view
of
comparing
the
new
haven
with
some
of
the
other
parties
here.
even
as
hopeless
a
bankrupt
as
the
new
haven,
has
revenues
that
are
twice
as
large
as
the
boston
and
maine.
they're
nearly
two
and
a
half
times
as
large
as
the
central
of
new
jersey
and
they're
nearly
three
times
as
large
as
the
delaware
and
hudson,
you'll
find
this
right
in
the
front
of
the
b&o
brief.
now,
even
as
to
the
erie-lackawanna,
it
must
be
realized
that
its
merger
was
made
effective
only
in
1960
as
recent
as
that
and
it
was
a
combination
of
the
erie
railroad
and
the
delaware-lackawanna
and
hudson
railroad.
today,
the
new
haven's
gross
revenues
are
more
than
half
of
the
erie-lackawanna
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
two
components
that
just
came
into
the
system
six
years
ago,
the
new
haven
was
as
important
as
either
one
of
them.
so
if
you're
talking
importance
on
the
test
used
by
mr.
trienens,
this
is
a
terribly
important
railroad.
if
you
look
at
net
income
as
mr.
justice
white
did
yesterday,
this
is
a
very
sick
railroad
when
one
recognizes
the
size
of
its
revenues.
now,
do
i
overstate
the
likelihood
of
liquidation
as
the
alternative
solution?
i
think
in
this
respect,
the
best
i
can
do
is
refer
the
court
to
judge
anderson.
judge
anderson
as
the
court
knows
was
the
district
judge
when
this
railroad
filed
reorganization.
when
he
was
elevated
to
the
court
of
appeals,
he
continued
to
sit
by
designation
as
the
district
judge
on
this
case.
he
has
complete
continuity.
quite
recently,
we
had
occasion
to
ask
permission
to
file
a
reorganization
plan
based
upon
our
contract
with
penn-central
in
order
to
carry
out
that
very
inclusion.
now,
this
was
opposed
by
some
of
our
bond
holders
on
the
ground
that
what
we
have
was
not
a
plan.
this
is
part
of
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
earlier
referred
to
today.
but
this
is
what
judge
anderson
said
in
directing
the
trustees
to
proceed
with
the
plan
which
is
now
to
be
heard
next
monday
in
new
york.
i'm
reading
from
b
(9)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
is
judge
anderson's
opinion,
“were
there
no
alternatives
available
on
proceedings
initiated
by
the
creditors,
liquidation
would
be
called
for.
nevertheless
at
the
present
moment,
liquidation,
close
as
it
may
be
cannot
presently
be
entertained
as
a
reasonable
alternative.
no
such
proceeding
has
been
commenced
and
from
the
record
of
this
case
and
the
recognized
cost
in
both
time
and
money
of
liquidating
a
railroad
such
as
the
new
haven,
which
for
many
years
has
been
a
deficit
operation,
the
court
concludes
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
new
haven
can
be
sold
and
then
operated
as
part
of
a
trunk
line
system
like
the
penn-central,
a
plan
of
reorganization
designed
to
that
end
is
in
the
best
interest
of
all
concerned
including
the
bond
holders.”
now,
we
had
occasion
in
an
earlier
opinion
to
refer
to
this
question
of
rather
than
new
haven
would
have
to
be
liquidated.
at
that
time
and
this
was
about
two
years
ago,
he
referred
to
mr,
justice
holmes
opinion
in
bullock
versus
state
of
florida
and
he
quoted
this
language,
“apart
from
statute
or
express
contract,
people
who
have
put
their
money
into
a
railroad
are
not
bound
to
go
on
with
that
at
a
loss
if
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
of
profitable
operation
in
the
future.
no
implied
contract
that
they
will
do
so
can
be
elicited
from
the
mere
fact
that
they've
accepted
a
charter
from
the
state
and
have
been
allowed
to
exercise
the
power
of
imminent
domain.”
and
in
the
same
opinion
he
quoted
from
judge
frank
in
third
avenue
transit
where
judge
frank
says,
“as
the
debtor
is
a
public
utility,
the
judge
properly
took
into
account
the
factor
of
the
public
interest
and
the
debtor's
continued
operation.
that,
however,
is
but
one
factor.
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
outweigh
all
others.
there
are
strict
limits
to
the
extent
to
which
in
reorganization
proceedings,
the
interests
of
creditors
or
of
a
particular
class
of
creditors
may
be
sacrificed
to
the
public
interest.
to
exceed
those
limits
is
to
save
the
least
from
dangerously
close
to
the
edge
of
unconstitutional
taking
of
the
property,
a
line
from
which
courts
should
keep
away
if
possible.”
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes
you
have
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
question
is,
can
this
merger
proceed
to
consummation
and
at
the
same
time,
can
this
court
effectively
review
whether
the
commission
has
carried
out
in
the
public
interest
protective
conditions
which
would
satisfy
this
court.
and
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
think
i
understand
your
question
fully
mr.
justice
fortas.
my
answer
would
be
no
to
both
forms
of
that
question,
the
legal
question
and
the
practical
question
but
i
would
say
to
you
in
this
respect
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
neither
legal
nor
practical,
but
let
me
say
to
the
court
in
this
respect,
i
think
you're
concerning
yourself
about
something
about
which
you
each
have
no
concern
and
the
reasons
are
these.
first,
the
commission
never
contemplated
that
the
protective
traffic
conditions
were
fixed
and
immutable.
as
mr.
cox
touched
on
today
and
i
would
read
the
language
that
he
touched
on,
in
fixing
the
conditions
and
this
is
part
of
their
order
here,
they
said
this,
“for
the
purpose
of
illustrating,”
i'm
reading
from
appendix
g
as
page
561
of
their
opinion,
“for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
but
in
no
way
limiting
the
application
of
this
condition,
the
following
specific
conditions
are
prescribed,
and
then
to
complete
the
pattern,
they
go
over
to
paragraph
c
on
page
562
and
they
say
--
paragraph
d
“all
determinations
as
to
whether
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
or
b&m
is
a
competitive
factor
and
they
digressed
for
a
moment,
these
are
all
key
to
a
definition
of
competitive
factor,
is
a
competitive
factor
shall
be
made
within
10
days
after
a
complaint
is
filed.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
have
the
answer
for
that
too
sir
i
think.
if
you
will
look
at
page
5
--
312
or
328,
which
is
the
supplemental
report,
which
is
after
they've
raised
their
petition
for
rehearing,
after
they
had
the
advantage
of
that
finding,
the
commission
said
this,
“we
recognize
that
we
cannot
at
this
time
guarantee
absolutely
that
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
and
b&m
will
be
included
in
a
major
rail
system
on
terms
which
they
find
satisfactory.
however,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
uncertainty
is
one
which
justifies
postponement
perhaps
for
several
years
of
large
public
benefits
which
will
flow
from
applicants'
merger,
and
what
i
say
to
you
your
honor
is
this,
the
larger
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
i
must
say
to
you
your
honor
that
i
think
when
you
read
appendix
g
and
find
out
a
scheme
which
gives
them
10-day
determination
absolute
protection
because
penn-central
has
agreed
not
to
appeal
from
these
determinations
that
you
could
not
have
more
adequate
protection.
but
what
i
just
read
to
you
your
honor
goes,
isn't
a
fortiori
case.
if
the
commission
is
willing
to
let
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
and
b&m
go
down
the
drain
because
this
language
i
just
read
to
you
says
that,
the
interim
protection
rather
academic.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i'm
afraid
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
may
i
say
on
this
last
point
that
every
plaintiff
below
treated
the
case
below
as
being
a
trial
on
the
merits
for
purposes
of
coming
to
this
court.
one
need
only
to
look
at
their
briefs
to
see
that
there
is
nothing
more
that
they
intend
to
offer
if
this
case
went
down
on
this
issue.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
in
my
argument
to
three
points.
i
must
say
at
the
outset
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
going
to
reach
them
all.
the
first
is
what
is
the
effect
on
the
new
haven
if
this
merger
is
delayed?
the
second
is
to
add
a
few
comments
on
the
historical
perspective
of
this
case,
and
finally,
if
time
permits,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
private
interest
question
versus
the
public
interest
findings
by
the
commission.
before
i
get
in
to
the
substance
of
my
argument,
however,
i
would
request
of
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
trustees,
a
special
procedure
in
this
case.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
issue
its
order
herein,
prior
to
entry
of
its
opinion,
no
matter
what
your
decision
may
be.
i
refer
in
this
connection
to
aaron
versus
cooper
in
358
u.s.,
mesarosh
versus
u.s.
in
352
and
collins
versus
loisel
in
262
and
the
reason
is,
whichever
way
you
decide
this
case,
we
go
to
trial
next
monday
in
new
york
on
a
plan
of
reorganization
that
is
premised
on
this
merger
going
through.
if
this
merger
isn't
going
through,
we're
going
to
waste
additional
assets
of
this
estate
upwards
of
$1
million.
we've
already
been
authorized
sums
of
that
kind
to
prosecute
the
case.
if
you
decide
therefore
that
this
case
cannot
be
decided
in
our
favor
which
is
to
say,
to
quash
this
stay
and
let
the
merger
go
forward,
we've
got
to
consider
as
fiduciaries
whether
we
go
back
to
judge
anderson
and
find
out
whether
any
money
should
be
spent
until
one
knows
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
reorganization.
conversely,
if
you
enter
an
order
which
permits
this
to
go
forward,
we
can
go
forward
with
the
assurance
that
one
day
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
with
the
time
in
question,
but
one
day,
the
new
haven
will
enter
in
its
home
and
that
isn't
the
issue,
is
there
a
home
for
the
new
haven.
going
to
the
substantive
volumes
now
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no
sir.
we're
out
of
time
schedule
now.
well,
let
me
go
back
a
bit
to
explain
why
i
say
that.
the
new
haven
is
the
most
incredible
reorganization
that
any
railroad
or
reorganization
law
has
ever
run
into
and
the
reasons
are
quite
simple.
it's
in
a
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
it
has
to
be
under
that
section,
there's
no
alternative,
but
this
is
a
section
that
never
contemplated
a
railroad
without
income
available
to
pay
fixed
charges.
it's
been
nine
years
that
the
new
haven
has
not
had
income
available
for
fixed
charges.
that
means
just
by
definition,
you
can
never
have
a
capital
structure
for
the
new
haven.
now
what
do
you
do?
you
do
what
the
trustees
have
done
for
five
years
which
is
through
a
combination
of
capitalization
of
the
property,
subsidy
from
the
states,
deferral
of
priority
claims,
i'm
speaking
now
of
real
estate
taxes
and
tort
claims,
deferral
of
all
these
things
meets
your
payroll.
they
have
done
it
for
five
years.
you
can't
go
on
doing
this.
now
this
court
may
decide
just
to
draw
a
complete
conclusion
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
may
decided
that
in
the
overall
public
interest,
the
interest
of
the
erie-lackawanna
and
the
delaware
and
hudson,
outweigh
the
benefits
to
the
public
from
preserving
the
new
haven.
i
don't
say
you
can't
decide
that.
the
commission
of
course
didn't
decide
that.
they
decided
the
new
haven
was
paramount,
decide
if
you
will
the
opposite
but
if
you
decided,
as
i
said
earlier,
please
enter
your
order
now
because
if
there's
another
meeting
that
can
be
saved
here,
the
trustees
ought
to
save
it.
the
new
haven's
concern
with
the
delay
in
consummation
is
two-fold.
until
the
merger
is
consummated,
the
merger
is
exposed
to
the
risk
that
will
never
be
a
merger.
and
if
it
never
will
be
a
merger,
we
don't
have
a
home
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
this
and
show
the
findings
that
have
been
made
in
that
respect.
the
second
point
is,
until
it
is
consummated,
the
new
haven's
ability
to
continue
to
finance
this,
if
you
will,
ridiculous
financial
situation
is
completely
nullified
but
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
we
know
there
is
a
place
where
the
new
haven
can
go.
we
know
that
because
the
commission
has
absolutely
provided
as
a
condition
that
they
must
take
the
new
haven.
now,
i'm
not
concerned
whether
the
terms
which
the
trustees
have
negotiated
and
i
may
say
this
is
in
a
complete
contract
of
whether
those
terms
of
the
final
terms
and
not
just
in
irrelevancy
because
once
the
merger
is
consummated,
the
new
haven
one
day
will
be
taken
and
whatever
terms
those
terms
may
be,
the
new
haven
will
be
taken.
that
means
that
during
the
interim
period
whether
these
trustees
or
some
other
trustees
run
this
estate,
they
can
go
to
banks,
they
can
go
to
the
states,
they
can
say,
here
is
what
it's
going
to
cost,
here
is
the
reasonable
period
of
time
required,
but
if
you
don't
know
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
merger,
if
this
court
merely
sense
this
back
for
further
proceedings,
if
we're
faced
with
a
two
to
five
years
that
mr.
ginnane
predicted
and
i
may
say,
i
thought
he
was
perhaps
modest
in
his
predictions.
if
we're
faced
with
that,
we
don't
even
know
where
to
get
the
next
dollar.
now,
i'd
given
you
the
two
reasons
why
a
merger
must
go
forward
so
far
as
the
new
haven
is
concerned.
now,
let
me
explain
to
the
court
if
i
may
why
those
two
concerns
have
a
bearing
on
this
case.
first,
are
the
new
haven's
operations
essential
in
the
public
interest?
well,
the
commission
specifically
found
that
and
in
the
court
below,
judge
winfield
did
not
disagree
with
that.
and
in
fact,
in
the
erie-lackawanna
reply
brief
in
this
case,
the
following
statement
is
made
at
page
21.
the
importance
of
preserving
the
new
haven
is
not
disputed.
none
of
them
disputes
that.
the
erie-lackawanna
brief
goes
on,
the
question
is,
is
it
necessary
because
of
the
new
haven
to
put
erie-lackawanna,
d&h
and
b&m
in
the
most
serious
jeopardy
in
order
to
have
a
consummation.
i
think
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
question.
i'm
prepared
to
show
the
court
today
that
they
are
not
put
in
jeopardy
because
the
protective
conditions
are
adequate
and
proper,
but
even
if
i
accept
the
question
as
put
by
the
erie-lackawanna,
i
would
say
to
the
court,
yes
it
is
necessary.
it
is
necessary
because
the
new
haven
is
essential
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
save
it.
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
does
inclusion
in
pennsylvania
and
new
york
central
save
the
new
haven?
answer?
yes.
the
commission
found
specifically
that
and
nobody
disagrees
with
that.
third,
is
there
any
other
possibility
of
saving
the
new
haven?
no.
the
commission
specifically
found
that
and
nobody
disagrees
with
that.
the
commission
said
and
this
is
at
328
i.c.c.
at
312.
absent
the
applicants'
merger,
we
see
no
solution
to
the
new
haven
problem.
certainly,
neither
of
the
applicant
separately
can
be
required
to
take
over
new
haven's
deficit
written
operations.
nobody
disagrees
with
that
finding.
in
fact,
no
one
really
quarrels
with
this
syllogism
i
have
just
been
through.
the
quarrel
comes
on
whether
a
delay
really
exposes
the
new
haven
to
a
risk
that
the
merger
will
abort.
thus,
if
it
aborts,
it
frustrates
completely
the
preservation
of
the
new
haven
and
the
public
interest
in
having
that
railroad
preserved.
so
let's
look
at
the
question,
am
i
over
stating
this
question?
well,
the
risk
that
the
merger
will
abort
was
found
specifically
by
the
commission,
they
addressed
themselves
right
to
this.
they
said,
if
consummation
of
the
applicants'
merger
delayed
several
years
or
indefinitely,
we
can
have
no
assurance
that
it
will
ever
occur.
the
factors
that
enter
to
an
agreement
to
merge
sooner
or
later
can
be
affected
by
changing
conditions.
and
then
they
went
on
to
say,
“we
are
not
prepared
to
take
this
risk
involved
in
a
substantial
postponement
of
consummation
of
the
merger.
moreover
and
this
is
the
language
that
i
would
bring
specifically
to
the
court's
attention,
moreover,
we
are
not
prepared
to
take
the
risks
which
delay
of
consummation
of
even
6
or
12
months
might
entail.”
now,
the
6
or
12
months
was
picked
up
out
of
these
petitions
for
rehearing
file
by
various
of
these
appellants.
and
the
court
was
saying,
“not
even
six
months.”
we
--
the
commission,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
commission
will
say,
“not
even
six
months
will
we
take
this
risk.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
calendar,
four
months
have
already
elapsed
since
september
in
this
--
that
i've
just
read
to
you
was
written.
but
n&w
and
c&o
and
b&o
whose
interest
in
this
case
is
demonstrated
by
their
briefs
and
argument
are
certainly
rather
remote,
but
they
on
one
hand,
in
erie-lackawanna
which
has
a
real
interest
on
the
other
hand,
assure
the
court
that
there
is
no
such
risk
of
an
abortion
here.
mr.
trienens
said
to
the
court
yesterday,
there
is
$81
million
of
glue.
mr.
bourne
in
his
brief
on
behalf
of
erie-lackawanna
says,
the
risk
that
this
would
be
aborted
in
the
near
future
is
and
i
quote
“miniscule”.
now
each
in
its
own
way
either
begs
or
distorts
the
question
that
the
court
must
decide.
the
risk
is
not
that
penn
or
central
voluntarily
with
that
way
as
mr.
cox
just
told
the
court,
of
course
they
won't.
apart
from
that
i
would
agreed
that
$81
million
of
glue
is
a
lot
of
glue,
but
it's
not
the
glue
that's
the
important
thing.
it's,
will
this
merger
abort
in
spite
of
their
desire
to
get
that
$81
million.
that's
the
risk
which
the
new
haven
is
subjected
and
apart
from
the
questions
that
mr.
cox
addressed
himself
to
of
how
do
you
manage,
continue
to
manage
and
a
price
of
this
size
vested
with
the
public
interest
without
knowing
whether
tomorrow
you're
going
to
be
a
combined
company
or
separate
company
without
knowing
what
you
do
about
employees
or
construction
programs
or
orders
for
new
freight
cars
or
building
of
yards.
you
can't
manage
indefinitely
under
those
circumstances.
but
apart
from
that
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no
sir.
if
he
did,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct
because
the
penn-central
has
accepted
the
commission's
order
flatly.
the
commission's
order
gives
the
penn-central
the
same
rights
that
the
new
haven
has
today
to
move
for
changes
in
its
passenger
service
under
the
transportation
act
of
1958.
it
gives
them
no
special
rights
nor
the
states
demand
special
rights.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
not
to
my
knowledge
sir.
as
i
started
to
say,
more
important
than
the
problem
of
corporate
management,
living
without
knowing
what's
going
to
happen,
is
that
no
matter
how
much
they
want
this
merger
to
stick
any
plan,
a
plan
of
reorganization
or
a
merger
plan
which
is
based
upon
a
stock
exchange
ratio
as
mr.
cox
pointed
out
is
particularly
vulnerable.
in
fact,
it
is
almost
too
numerous
to
less.
the
members
of
this
court
know
that
whenever
you
have
a
merger
plan
or
reorganization
plan
based
upon
an
exchange
ratio,
it's
subject
to
vagaries
of
changes
and
circumstances.
what
erie-lackawanna
makes
the
prediction
that
the
likelihood
of
a
change
in
the
near
future
that
is
a
change
in
circumstances
is
minuscule.
it
is
foolhardy
or
naive
in
making
such
a
prediction.
one
thing
is
certain
even
if
it
is
minuscule
and
let's
assume
for
that
purpose
that
it
is,
this
was
a
risk
which
the
commission
refused
to
take.
now,
it
had
to
make
findings
on
both
sides
and
it
did
and
it
refused
to
take
the
risk.
the
appellants
ask
the
court
now
to
take
this
risk.
now
because
you're
being
asked
to
take
the
risk,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
consider
what
the
consequences
of
the
risk
are.
if
this
merger
aborts
as
demonstrated
by
the
syllogism
i
went
through
earlier
the
new
haven
will
be
forced
to
liquidate.
now,
what
does
this
mean?
it
must
first
be
realized
that
if
the
new
haven
liquidates,
service
to
17
million
persons,
that
being
the
population
of
the
service
area
of
the
new
haven
is
adversely
affected.
on
a
daily
basis,
the
new
haven
carries
65,000
of
those
persons
on
its
passenger
trains.on
a
daily
basis,
the
new
haven
now,
brings
in
and
out
of
new
england
60,000
tons
of
freight
and
the
livelihood
as
well
as
the
food
of
persons
depends
--
the
cost
of
food
depends
on
this
kind
of
service.
if
it
were
not
so,
this
would
be
moving
by
some
of
them
right
now.
these
are
the
direct
consequences
of
a
social
and
public
nature.
the
court
may
recall
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
yesterday
of
mr.
trienens
with
respect
to
a
gross
revenues
test
in
determining
importance
of
railroads,
a
table
which
appears
in
his
brief.
let's
just
look
at
that
gross
revenue
test.
in
the
point
of
view
of
comparing
the
new
haven
with
some
of
the
other
parties
here.
even
as
hopeless
a
bankrupt
as
the
new
haven,
has
revenues
that
are
twice
as
large
as
the
boston
and
maine.
they're
nearly
two
and
a
half
times
as
large
as
the
central
of
new
jersey
and
they're
nearly
three
times
as
large
as
the
delaware
and
hudson,
you'll
find
this
right
in
the
front
of
the
b&o
brief.
now,
even
as
to
the
erie-lackawanna,
it
must
be
realized
that
its
merger
was
made
effective
only
in
1960
as
recent
as
that
and
it
was
a
combination
of
the
erie
railroad
and
the
delaware-lackawanna
and
hudson
railroad.
today,
the
new
haven's
gross
revenues
are
more
than
half
of
the
erie-lackawanna
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
two
components
that
just
came
into
the
system
six
years
ago,
the
new
haven
was
as
important
as
either
one
of
them.
so
if
you're
talking
importance
on
the
test
used
by
mr.
trienens,
this
is
a
terribly
important
railroad.
if
you
look
at
net
income
as
mr.
justice
white
did
yesterday,
this
is
a
very
sick
railroad
when
one
recognizes
the
size
of
its
revenues.
now,
do
i
overstate
the
likelihood
of
liquidation
as
the
alternative
solution?
i
think
in
this
respect,
the
best
i
can
do
is
refer
the
court
to
judge
anderson.
judge
anderson
as
the
court
knows
was
the
district
judge
when
this
railroad
filed
reorganization.
when
he
was
elevated
to
the
court
of
appeals,
he
continued
to
sit
by
designation
as
the
district
judge
on
this
case.
he
has
complete
continuity.
quite
recently,
we
had
occasion
to
ask
permission
to
file
a
reorganization
plan
based
upon
our
contract
with
penn-central
in
order
to
carry
out
that
very
inclusion.
now,
this
was
opposed
by
some
of
our
bond
holders
on
the
ground
that
what
we
have
was
not
a
plan.
this
is
part
of
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
earlier
referred
to
today.
but
this
is
what
judge
anderson
said
in
directing
the
trustees
to
proceed
with
the
plan
which
is
now
to
be
heard
next
monday
in
new
york.
i'm
reading
from
b
(9)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
is
judge
anderson's
opinion,
“were
there
no
alternatives
available
on
proceedings
initiated
by
the
creditors,
liquidation
would
be
called
for.
nevertheless
at
the
present
moment,
liquidation,
close
as
it
may
be
cannot
presently
be
entertained
as
a
reasonable
alternative.
no
such
proceeding
has
been
commenced
and
from
the
record
of
this
case
and
the
recognized
cost
in
both
time
and
money
of
liquidating
a
railroad
such
as
the
new
haven,
which
for
many
years
has
been
a
deficit
operation,
the
court
concludes
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
new
haven
can
be
sold
and
then
operated
as
part
of
a
trunk
line
system
like
the
penn-central,
a
plan
of
reorganization
designed
to
that
end
is
in
the
best
interest
of
all
concerned
including
the
bond
holders.”
now,
we
had
occasion
in
an
earlier
opinion
to
refer
to
this
question
of
rather
than
new
haven
would
have
to
be
liquidated.
at
that
time
and
this
was
about
two
years
ago,
he
referred
to
mr,
justice
holmes
opinion
in
bullock
versus
state
of
florida
and
he
quoted
this
language,
“apart
from
statute
or
express
contract,
people
who
have
put
their
money
into
a
railroad
are
not
bound
to
go
on
with
that
at
a
loss
if
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
of
profitable
operation
in
the
future.
no
implied
contract
that
they
will
do
so
can
be
elicited
from
the
mere
fact
that
they've
accepted
a
charter
from
the
state
and
have
been
allowed
to
exercise
the
power
of
imminent
domain.”
and
in
the
same
opinion
he
quoted
from
judge
frank
in
third
avenue
transit
where
judge
frank
says,
“as
the
debtor
is
a
public
utility,
the
judge
properly
took
into
account
the
factor
of
the
public
interest
and
the
debtor's
continued
operation.
that,
however,
is
but
one
factor.
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
outweigh
all
others.
there
are
strict
limits
to
the
extent
to
which
in
reorganization
proceedings,
the
interests
of
creditors
or
of
a
particular
class
of
creditors
may
be
sacrificed
to
the
public
interest.
to
exceed
those
limits
is
to
save
the
least
from
dangerously
close
to
the
edge
of
unconstitutional
taking
of
the
property,
a
line
from
which
courts
should
keep
away
if
possible.”
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes
you
have
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
question
is,
can
this
merger
proceed
to
consummation
and
at
the
same
time,
can
this
court
effectively
review
whether
the
commission
has
carried
out
in
the
public
interest
protective
conditions
which
would
satisfy
this
court.
and
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
think
i
understand
your
question
fully
mr.
justice
fortas.
my
answer
would
be
no
to
both
forms
of
that
question,
the
legal
question
and
the
practical
question
but
i
would
say
to
you
in
this
respect
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
neither
legal
nor
practical,
but
let
me
say
to
the
court
in
this
respect,
i
think
you're
concerning
yourself
about
something
about
which
you
each
have
no
concern
and
the
reasons
are
these.
first,
the
commission
never
contemplated
that
the
protective
traffic
conditions
were
fixed
and
immutable.
as
mr.
cox
touched
on
today
and
i
would
read
the
language
that
he
touched
on,
in
fixing
the
conditions
and
this
is
part
of
their
order
here,
they
said
this,
“for
the
purpose
of
illustrating,”
i'm
reading
from
appendix
g
as
page
561
of
their
opinion,
“for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
but
in
no
way
limiting
the
application
of
this
condition,
the
following
specific
conditions
are
prescribed,
and
then
to
complete
the
pattern,
they
go
over
to
paragraph
c
on
page
562
and
they
say
--
paragraph
d
“all
determinations
as
to
whether
the
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
or
b&m
is
a
competitive
factor
and
they
digressed
for
a
moment,
these
are
all
key
to
a
definition
of
competitive
factor,
is
a
competitive
factor
shall
be
made
within
10
days
after
a
complaint
is
filed.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
have
the
answer
for
that
too
sir
i
think.
if
you
will
look
at
page
5
--
312
or
328,
which
is
the
supplemental
report,
which
is
after
they've
raised
their
petition
for
rehearing,
after
they
had
the
advantage
of
that
finding,
the
commission
said
this,
“we
recognize
that
we
cannot
at
this
time
guarantee
absolutely
that
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
and
b&m
will
be
included
in
a
major
rail
system
on
terms
which
they
find
satisfactory.
however,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
uncertainty
is
one
which
justifies
postponement
perhaps
for
several
years
of
large
public
benefits
which
will
flow
from
applicants'
merger,
and
what
i
say
to
you
your
honor
is
this,
the
larger
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
i
must
say
to
you
your
honor
that
i
think
when
you
read
appendix
g
and
find
out
a
scheme
which
gives
them
10-day
determination
absolute
protection
because
penn-central
has
agreed
not
to
appeal
from
these
determinations
that
you
could
not
have
more
adequate
protection.
but
what
i
just
read
to
you
your
honor
goes,
isn't
a
fortiori
case.
if
the
commission
is
willing
to
let
erie-lackawanna,
delaware
and
hudson
and
b&m
go
down
the
drain
because
this
language
i
just
read
to
you
says
that,
the
interim
protection
rather
academic.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i'm
afraid
your
honor
--
