mr.
leon
keyserling
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
realize
the
difficulty
in
the
court
of
law
of
reconstructing
a
railroad
reorganization
proposal.
and
therefore
in
representing
scranton
and
i
will
try
to
get
back
from
the
problems
of
small
railroads
or
even
their
squabbles,
the
large
problems
of
a
great
nation.
for
it
is
my
considered
view
that
no
matter
what
may
be
done
about
these
smaller
railroads
in
the
near
future
or
on
the
longer
future.
the
basic
merger
of
penn-central
on
the
basis
proposed,
on
the
basis
approved
by
the
commission,
on
the
basis
projected
with
due
violence
to
the
prime
criterion
of
an
adequate
transportation
service
for
the
people
and
the
country.
would
do
this
damage
not
only
in
the
eastern
district
and
therefore
throughout
the
nation
because
of
the
importance
of
that
districts.
and
of
course
would
do
even
more
damage
to
particularly
vulnerable
sectors
of
the
eastern
districts
such
as
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
city
of
scranton.
now,
the
reasons
why
these
injuries
are
of
legal
significance
are
threefold.
first,
the
findings
of
the
commission,
not
the
findings
they
may
make
in
some
speculative
future
proceedings
but
the
findings
they
did
make
in
this
proceeding
where
unsupported
by
the
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole.
second,
the
commission
substituted
its
own
policies
for
those
of
the
congress.
and
third,
the
commission
found
no
countervailing
benefits
in
the
public
interest
to
outweigh
the
general
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
the
heart
of
this
merger
proposal
requires
a
little
history.
in
1960
--
1953,
the
country
started
on
the
period
of
low
economic
growth
that
probes
problems
to
many
industries.
the
railroads
like
others
were
hit.
but
unlike
other
industries
which
sought
to
work
out
their
salvation
through
becoming
more
competitive
and
through
investing
in
modernization
to
meet
the
challenge
of
better
times
when
they
came.
these
two
roads
did
two
things.
they
drastically
slash
their
services,
railroads,
locomotives,
freight
cars
to
the
tune
of
26%
to
48%.
and
second,
they
allowed
their
prices
in
the
face
of
advancing
it
to
motor
competition
to
remain
37%
higher
than
those
that
they
have
been
in
1947.
then,
when
these
two
roads
were
hurt
most
in
their
income
by
their
own
misguided
policies,
they
sought
to
the
merger
to
find
salvation
through
a
further
extension
of
the
same
policies
that
it
hurt
them
this
far
because
the
heart
of
a
merger
proposal
was
not
to
achieve
savings
by
expansion,
by
modernization.
the
heart
of
the
merger
was
to
achieve
$80
million
in
savings
primarily
by
further
slashes
in
facilities
and
services.
and
this
of
course
had
to
be
defended
first
on
the
ground
that
these
slashed
services
would
comport
with
the
needs
of
the
nation
in
terms
of
economic
growth
and
in
terms
of
the
traffic
carriers
particularly
ten
miles
it
would
impose
upon
the
two-mile
roads.
now,
the
very
heart
of
this
case
is
found
in
one
little
chart
at
the
very
end
of
my
appendix
brief
which
compares
the
findings
on
which
the
commission
approves
this
merger
not
with
hypothesis
but
with
one
that
actually
happened
when
they
approved
the
merger.
because
the
railroads
has
estimated
and
the
examiners
had
based
approval
of
the
merger
or
recommended
approval
upon
traffic
in
this
forecast
in
1961
through
1970
because
no
comprehensive
data
late
of
1961
were
available
and
the
case
was
prepared
in
1962.
but
when
the
case
was
before
the
commission
in
early
1966
it
knew
that
when
is
very
forecast
which
is
still
accepting
were
based
upon
an
economic
growth
rate
of
3%
in
1961
to
1970.
the
actual
growth
rate
from
1961
to
1965
have
been
5.4%
or
80%
higher
than
the
very
forecast
upon
which
the
commission
itself
acted.
second,
with
respect
to
traffic,
the
commission's
decision
was
founded
and
the
projection
that
from
1961
traffic
were
declined
6
1/2%
by
1965,
at
9%
by
1970
when
the
commission
acted,
traffic
had
actually
gone
up
22%
since
1965.
since
1961
and
1966,
it
was
43%
higher
than
the
commission's
forecast
for
1970.
and
similarly
is
to
find
answers,
the
commission's
finding
were
rooted
in
the
minus
$9
million
of
net
income
in
1961,
whereas
in
1965,
it
was
$75
million
and
consolidated
income
was
about
$100
million,
and
cash
flow
which
is
more
important
that
year
was
about
$166
million.
now,
i've
come
to
other
reasons
why
income
isn't
really
relevant
at
all
but
there
it
was.
now,
how
did
the
commission
get
around
the
fact
that
in
itself
was
adopting
findings
which
the
fact
before
it
shown
had
already
been
refuted
by
5
years
of
experience?
it
said,
“maybe”,
over
the
years
between
1966
and
1970
there's
going
to
be
such
a
cataclysmic
decline
of
the
economy
of
united
states
that
over
the
whole
period
of
1961-1970
the
railroads
and
the
examiners
will
turn
out
to
be
right.
now,
this
was
not
only
irrational
in
terms
where
were
in
1966.
it
was
not
only
irrational
in
terms
of
the
whole
record
from
1922
and
1961
where
you
have
a
much
higher
rate
of
growth
than
they
have
hypothesize
even
including
the
great
depression.
and
it
violated
the
requirements
that
the
commission
not
substituted
philosophy
of
who
invest
for
the
emphasis
of
transportation
legislation
upon
adequacy
of
service
and
growth
because
if
the
railroads
are
permitted
to
budget
their
facilities
upon
the
average
of
the
trust,
of
the
peaks
of
the
business
cycle,
they
will
always
militate
against
full
prosperity
and
always
be
short
with
the
actual
prosperity.
and
frequent
--
and
many
items
of
congressional
legislation
recognizes
as
of
now
that
they
are
seriously
shown
on
the
eastern
district
and
indeed
throughout
the
nation.
furthermore,
let
us
look
at
what
would
have
to
happen
for
the
forecast
upon
which
the
commission
acted
to
come
through
in
the
future
eventhough
they
have
been
so
outrageously
wrong
at
the
time
when
the
commission
acted.
we
would
have
to
have
in
the
next
three
years
a
decline
in
the
u.s.
economic
growth
rate
about
1%.
we
would
have
to
have
a
decline
in
traffic
of
these
roads
at
about
30%
and
this
could
happen
only
in
the
event
of
a
national
economic
calamity
that
would
wreck
us
both
at
home
and
overseas.
and
if
regulatory
commission
out
of
predicate,
the
budgeting
of
the
facilities
of
great
industries
of
this
gloomy
hypothesis,
they
will
have
to
propitiate
the
very
thing
that
they
should
be
seeking
to
avoid.
now,
these
wrong
findings
as
to
traffic
collapse
all
of
the
findings
out
of
financial
basis
because
the
examiners
fail
and
the
commission
has
approved
that
their
primary
concern
was
the
financial
condition
of
the
railroads.
now,
even
aside
for
the
fact
that
minus
9
if
they
change
to
a
120
--
plus
a
122
by
the
time
the
commission
acted,
aside
from
that,
the
mandate
of
the
congress
is
the
prime
test
if
the
adequacy
of
needs
and
no
savings
plan.
predicated
upon
saving
the
investor
by
starving
the
public
can't
pass
on
the
congressional
legislation.
my
findings
as
to
traffic
needs
which
were
before
the
commission
which
is
turn
out
to
be
precise
and
be
right
where
they
acted
to
the
decimal
point
were
consistent
with
the
need
more
facilities
by
1970
not
less.
and
the
congress
by
that
time,
in
many
ways,
and
the
commission
has
found
for
in
many
ways.
and
re
--
and
the
administrative
agencies
in
many
ways
and
the
tax
reductions
had
help
the
railroads
to
the
tune
of
the
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
income
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
to
meet
the
criterion
of
adequacy
of
service
rather
than
to
be
guided
by
the
criterion
of
how
the
railroads
could
save
themselves
by
starving
the
public.
now,
in
1967,
the
proponents
of
the
railroad
merger
come
forward
and
say,
“we
want
modernization,
this
is
what
we're
going
to
us
these
savings
for”.
we
want
to
compete.
we
want
to
expand
services.
but
this
is
not
the
purpose
on
which
the
savings
--
the
savings
will
projected.
this
is
not
the
basis
on
which
they
were
examined
by
the
commission.
this
is
not
the
basis
on
which
they
were
supported
by
the
findings
of
the
commission
and
this
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
merger
was
approved.
the
history
from
196
--
from
1953
to
now
shows,
from
1961
shows
that
without
benefit
of
merger
the
two
roads
have
increased
their
carriage
by
25%
per
ten
miles.
they
haven't
met
the
shortages
that
they
themselves
created
but
then
if
--
if
they
could
increase
carriage
by
25%
without
the
merger,
they
can
increase
it
still
more
without
merger
and
their
internal
income
is
sufficient
for
this
purpose
and
their
external
income
is
sufficient
for
this
purpose
as
indicated
by
the
fact
of
security
markets
it
apprised.
there
are
common
stocks
tremendously
and
the
rate
of
return
is
irrelevant
although
it
will
be
argued
to
contrary
because
the
rate
of
return
is
merely
a
commentary
upon
whether
it
is
feasible
for
them
to
borrow
money.
and
the
benefits
to
that
is
the
valuation
of
their
stocks
with
the
security
markets
and
in
any
event
just
as
the
commission
was
wrong
in
all
of
its
income
findings,
it
was
equally
wrong
on
its
rate
of
return
findings
because
rate
of
return
depends
ultimately
on
the
income.
now,
the
commission
says,
“they
will
be
able
to
compete
better
with
in
the
modal
transportation
if
they
merge”.
the
first
requirement
of
competing
in
the
modal
is
to
compete
among
ourselves.
we
can't
play
tennis
against
the
australians
if
we
don't
practice
amongst
ourselves
and
the
automobile
industry
couldn't
compete
with
other
modes
of
transport
if
they
didn't
compete
among
themselves.
every
legitimate
purpose
of
expansion
of
modernization
of
competition
does
not
require
this
merger
and
therefore,
there
is
no
justification
whatsoever
for
this
merge
around
the
ground
that
conditions
of
the
public
interest
outweigh
the
limited
applications
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
corporate
mergers
of
railroads.
this
merger
if
a
comp
--
if
accomplished
would
put
it
of
the
hands
of
penn-central
about
40%
of
the
total
gross
revenues
of
the
district.
this
is
very
close
to
general
motors.
some
people
think
general
motors
is
too
high.
in
any
event
general
motors
wasn't
achieved
by
an
official
government
sanction.
and
in
any
event,
when
general
motors
occupies
40%
of
the
markets,
it
has
60%
competition
everywhere
throughout
the
country.
when
penn-central
occupied
40%
of
the
markets,
their
preemption
of
the
market
at
150
communities
which
they
both
serve
may
run
up
for
40%,
60%
to
80%,
to
a
100%.
an
opponent
of
the
merger
asks
the
commission
to
study
this
question
which
it
refused
to
do,
but
even
compared
with
the
40
--
with
a
39%.
the
preemption
of
the
market
runs
only
from
29%
to
8%
by
such
corporations
as
u.s.
steel,
alcoa,
dupont,
bank
of
america,
metropolitan
life,
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
and
all
except
to
one
of
them
are
below
19%.
if
we
need
a
reorganization
of
railroads
in
the
eastern
district,
there
can
be
no
balance
based
upon
these
months
to
come
by.
in
fact,
by
showing
on
chart
23
of
my
joint
appendix
in
view
of
the
tremendous
acquisitions,
the
tremendous
mergers
and
the
tremendous
acquisitions
of
non-railroad
properties
which
these
two
roads
have
already
undertaken,
if
they
couldn't
work
themselves
out
of
their
troubles
by
all
of
that
growth,
they
got
into
trouble
because
they
were
already
to
swollen
and
rather
than
too
small.
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
this
merger
was
opposed
until
1966
by
the
counsel
of
economic
advisers
and
part
of
the
inter-agency
committee
and
by
the
department
of
justice.
i
would
like
to
analyze
why
a
merger
repose
with
the
railroads
were
allegedly
in
financial
crisis
in
1961.
it's
in
court
in
the
1967.
this
merger
was
wrong
in
1961,
it's
more
wrong
today.
it
is
based
upon
their
contraction
and
restriction
of
the
transportation
based
in
our
economy
in
the
nation
which
we
now
know
with
all
the
economic
growth
to
date
can
hardly
meet
its
great
domestic
and
international
responsibilities.
to
survive
and
prosper,
we
must
grow.
nothing
would
be
gained
by
setting
this
merger
back.
i
respectfully
submit
it
should
be
denied.
mr.
leon
keyserling
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
realize
the
difficulty
in
the
court
of
law
of
reconstructing
a
railroad
reorganization
proposal.
and
therefore
in
representing
scranton
and
i
will
try
to
get
back
from
the
problems
of
small
railroads
or
even
their
squabbles,
the
large
problems
of
a
great
nation.
for
it
is
my
considered
view
that
no
matter
what
may
be
done
about
these
smaller
railroads
in
the
near
future
or
on
the
longer
future.
the
basic
merger
of
penn-central
on
the
basis
proposed,
on
the
basis
approved
by
the
commission,
on
the
basis
projected
with
due
violence
to
the
prime
criterion
of
an
adequate
transportation
service
for
the
people
and
the
country.
would
do
this
damage
not
only
in
the
eastern
district
and
therefore
throughout
the
nation
because
of
the
importance
of
that
districts.
and
of
course
would
do
even
more
damage
to
particularly
vulnerable
sectors
of
the
eastern
districts
such
as
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
city
of
scranton.
now,
the
reasons
why
these
injuries
are
of
legal
significance
are
threefold.
first,
the
findings
of
the
commission,
not
the
findings
they
may
make
in
some
speculative
future
proceedings
but
the
findings
they
did
make
in
this
proceeding
where
unsupported
by
the
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole.
second,
the
commission
substituted
its
own
policies
for
those
of
the
congress.
and
third,
the
commission
found
no
countervailing
benefits
in
the
public
interest
to
outweigh
the
general
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
the
heart
of
this
merger
proposal
requires
a
little
history.
in
1960
--
1953,
the
country
started
on
the
period
of
low
economic
growth
that
probes
problems
to
many
industries.
the
railroads
like
others
were
hit.
but
unlike
other
industries
which
sought
to
work
out
their
salvation
through
becoming
more
competitive
and
through
investing
in
modernization
to
meet
the
challenge
of
better
times
when
they
came.
these
two
roads
did
two
things.
they
drastically
slash
their
services,
railroads,
locomotives,
freight
cars
to
the
tune
of
26%
to
48%.
and
second,
they
allowed
their
prices
in
the
face
of
advancing
it
to
motor
competition
to
remain
37%
higher
than
those
that
they
have
been
in
1947.
then,
when
these
two
roads
were
hurt
most
in
their
income
by
their
own
misguided
policies,
they
sought
to
the
merger
to
find
salvation
through
a
further
extension
of
the
same
policies
that
it
hurt
them
this
far
because
the
heart
of
a
merger
proposal
was
not
to
achieve
savings
by
expansion,
by
modernization.
the
heart
of
the
merger
was
to
achieve
$80
million
in
savings
primarily
by
further
slashes
in
facilities
and
services.
and
this
of
course
had
to
be
defended
first
on
the
ground
that
these
slashed
services
would
comport
with
the
needs
of
the
nation
in
terms
of
economic
growth
and
in
terms
of
the
traffic
carriers
particularly
ten
miles
it
would
impose
upon
the
two-mile
roads.
now,
the
very
heart
of
this
case
is
found
in
one
little
chart
at
the
very
end
of
my
appendix
brief
which
compares
the
findings
on
which
the
commission
approves
this
merger
not
with
hypothesis
but
with
one
that
actually
happened
when
they
approved
the
merger.
because
the
railroads
has
estimated
and
the
examiners
had
based
approval
of
the
merger
or
recommended
approval
upon
traffic
in
this
forecast
in
1961
through
1970
because
no
comprehensive
data
late
of
1961
were
available
and
the
case
was
prepared
in
1962.
but
when
the
case
was
before
the
commission
in
early
1966
it
knew
that
when
is
very
forecast
which
is
still
accepting
were
based
upon
an
economic
growth
rate
of
3%
in
1961
to
1970.
the
actual
growth
rate
from
1961
to
1965
have
been
5.4%
or
80%
higher
than
the
very
forecast
upon
which
the
commission
itself
acted.
second,
with
respect
to
traffic,
the
commission's
decision
was
founded
and
the
projection
that
from
1961
traffic
were
declined
6
1/2%
by
1965,
at
9%
by
1970
when
the
commission
acted,
traffic
had
actually
gone
up
22%
since
1965.
since
1961
and
1966,
it
was
43%
higher
than
the
commission's
forecast
for
1970.
and
similarly
is
to
find
answers,
the
commission's
finding
were
rooted
in
the
minus
$9
million
of
net
income
in
1961,
whereas
in
1965,
it
was
$75
million
and
consolidated
income
was
about
$100
million,
and
cash
flow
which
is
more
important
that
year
was
about
$166
million.
now,
i've
come
to
other
reasons
why
income
isn't
really
relevant
at
all
but
there
it
was.
now,
how
did
the
commission
get
around
the
fact
that
in
itself
was
adopting
findings
which
the
fact
before
it
shown
had
already
been
refuted
by
5
years
of
experience?
it
said,
“maybe”,
over
the
years
between
1966
and
1970
there's
going
to
be
such
a
cataclysmic
decline
of
the
economy
of
united
states
that
over
the
whole
period
of
1961-1970
the
railroads
and
the
examiners
will
turn
out
to
be
right.
now,
this
was
not
only
irrational
in
terms
where
were
in
1966.
it
was
not
only
irrational
in
terms
of
the
whole
record
from
1922
and
1961
where
you
have
a
much
higher
rate
of
growth
than
they
have
hypothesize
even
including
the
great
depression.
and
it
violated
the
requirements
that
the
commission
not
substituted
philosophy
of
who
invest
for
the
emphasis
of
transportation
legislation
upon
adequacy
of
service
and
growth
because
if
the
railroads
are
permitted
to
budget
their
facilities
upon
the
average
of
the
trust,
of
the
peaks
of
the
business
cycle,
they
will
always
militate
against
full
prosperity
and
always
be
short
with
the
actual
prosperity.
and
frequent
--
and
many
items
of
congressional
legislation
recognizes
as
of
now
that
they
are
seriously
shown
on
the
eastern
district
and
indeed
throughout
the
nation.
furthermore,
let
us
look
at
what
would
have
to
happen
for
the
forecast
upon
which
the
commission
acted
to
come
through
in
the
future
eventhough
they
have
been
so
outrageously
wrong
at
the
time
when
the
commission
acted.
we
would
have
to
have
in
the
next
three
years
a
decline
in
the
u.s.
economic
growth
rate
about
1%.
we
would
have
to
have
a
decline
in
traffic
of
these
roads
at
about
30%
and
this
could
happen
only
in
the
event
of
a
national
economic
calamity
that
would
wreck
us
both
at
home
and
overseas.
and
if
regulatory
commission
out
of
predicate,
the
budgeting
of
the
facilities
of
great
industries
of
this
gloomy
hypothesis,
they
will
have
to
propitiate
the
very
thing
that
they
should
be
seeking
to
avoid.
now,
these
wrong
findings
as
to
traffic
collapse
all
of
the
findings
out
of
financial
basis
because
the
examiners
fail
and
the
commission
has
approved
that
their
primary
concern
was
the
financial
condition
of
the
railroads.
now,
even
aside
for
the
fact
that
minus
9
if
they
change
to
a
120
--
plus
a
122
by
the
time
the
commission
acted,
aside
from
that,
the
mandate
of
the
congress
is
the
prime
test
if
the
adequacy
of
needs
and
no
savings
plan.
predicated
upon
saving
the
investor
by
starving
the
public
can't
pass
on
the
congressional
legislation.
my
findings
as
to
traffic
needs
which
were
before
the
commission
which
is
turn
out
to
be
precise
and
be
right
where
they
acted
to
the
decimal
point
were
consistent
with
the
need
more
facilities
by
1970
not
less.
and
the
congress
by
that
time,
in
many
ways,
and
the
commission
has
found
for
in
many
ways.
and
re
--
and
the
administrative
agencies
in
many
ways
and
the
tax
reductions
had
help
the
railroads
to
the
tune
of
the
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
income
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
to
meet
the
criterion
of
adequacy
of
service
rather
than
to
be
guided
by
the
criterion
of
how
the
railroads
could
save
themselves
by
starving
the
public.
now,
in
1967,
the
proponents
of
the
railroad
merger
come
forward
and
say,
“we
want
modernization,
this
is
what
we're
going
to
us
these
savings
for”.
we
want
to
compete.
we
want
to
expand
services.
but
this
is
not
the
purpose
on
which
the
savings
--
the
savings
will
projected.
this
is
not
the
basis
on
which
they
were
examined
by
the
commission.
this
is
not
the
basis
on
which
they
were
supported
by
the
findings
of
the
commission
and
this
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
merger
was
approved.
the
history
from
196
--
from
1953
to
now
shows,
from
1961
shows
that
without
benefit
of
merger
the
two
roads
have
increased
their
carriage
by
25%
per
ten
miles.
they
haven't
met
the
shortages
that
they
themselves
created
but
then
if
--
if
they
could
increase
carriage
by
25%
without
the
merger,
they
can
increase
it
still
more
without
merger
and
their
internal
income
is
sufficient
for
this
purpose
and
their
external
income
is
sufficient
for
this
purpose
as
indicated
by
the
fact
of
security
markets
it
apprised.
there
are
common
stocks
tremendously
and
the
rate
of
return
is
irrelevant
although
it
will
be
argued
to
contrary
because
the
rate
of
return
is
merely
a
commentary
upon
whether
it
is
feasible
for
them
to
borrow
money.
and
the
benefits
to
that
is
the
valuation
of
their
stocks
with
the
security
markets
and
in
any
event
just
as
the
commission
was
wrong
in
all
of
its
income
findings,
it
was
equally
wrong
on
its
rate
of
return
findings
because
rate
of
return
depends
ultimately
on
the
income.
now,
the
commission
says,
“they
will
be
able
to
compete
better
with
in
the
modal
transportation
if
they
merge”.
the
first
requirement
of
competing
in
the
modal
is
to
compete
among
ourselves.
we
can't
play
tennis
against
the
australians
if
we
don't
practice
amongst
ourselves
and
the
automobile
industry
couldn't
compete
with
other
modes
of
transport
if
they
didn't
compete
among
themselves.
every
legitimate
purpose
of
expansion
of
modernization
of
competition
does
not
require
this
merger
and
therefore,
there
is
no
justification
whatsoever
for
this
merge
around
the
ground
that
conditions
of
the
public
interest
outweigh
the
limited
applications
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
corporate
mergers
of
railroads.
this
merger
if
a
comp
--
if
accomplished
would
put
it
of
the
hands
of
penn-central
about
40%
of
the
total
gross
revenues
of
the
district.
this
is
very
close
to
general
motors.
some
people
think
general
motors
is
too
high.
in
any
event
general
motors
wasn't
achieved
by
an
official
government
sanction.
and
in
any
event,
when
general
motors
occupies
40%
of
the
markets,
it
has
60%
competition
everywhere
throughout
the
country.
when
penn-central
occupied
40%
of
the
markets,
their
preemption
of
the
market
at
150
communities
which
they
both
serve
may
run
up
for
40%,
60%
to
80%,
to
a
100%.
an
opponent
of
the
merger
asks
the
commission
to
study
this
question
which
it
refused
to
do,
but
even
compared
with
the
40
--
with
a
39%.
the
preemption
of
the
market
runs
only
from
29%
to
8%
by
such
corporations
as
u.s.
steel,
alcoa,
dupont,
bank
of
america,
metropolitan
life,
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
and
all
except
to
one
of
them
are
below
19%.
if
we
need
a
reorganization
of
railroads
in
the
eastern
district,
there
can
be
no
balance
based
upon
these
months
to
come
by.
in
fact,
by
showing
on
chart
23
of
my
joint
appendix
in
view
of
the
tremendous
acquisitions,
the
tremendous
mergers
and
the
tremendous
acquisitions
of
non-railroad
properties
which
these
two
roads
have
already
undertaken,
if
they
couldn't
work
themselves
out
of
their
troubles
by
all
of
that
growth,
they
got
into
trouble
because
they
were
already
to
swollen
and
rather
than
too
small.
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
this
merger
was
opposed
until
1966
by
the
counsel
of
economic
advisers
and
part
of
the
inter-agency
committee
and
by
the
department
of
justice.
i
would
like
to
analyze
why
a
merger
repose
with
the
railroads
were
allegedly
in
financial
crisis
in
1961.
it's
in
court
in
the
1967.
this
merger
was
wrong
in
1961,
it's
more
wrong
today.
it
is
based
upon
their
contraction
and
restriction
of
the
transportation
based
in
our
economy
in
the
nation
which
we
now
know
with
all
the
economic
growth
to
date
can
hardly
meet
its
great
domestic
and
international
responsibilities.
to
survive
and
prosper,
we
must
grow.
nothing
would
be
gained
by
setting
this
merger
back.
i
respectfully
submit
it
should
be
denied.
