justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
cox.
what
are
the
conditions
that
are
now
approved
by
the
i.c.c.?
isn't
the
i.c.c.
reconsidering
those
conditions?
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
no
indication
that
the
i.c.c.
considered
the
traffic
conditions
standing
alone
as
adequate
to
meet
the
requirements
in
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
another
way
of
saying.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
and
i
will
ask
you
this
mr.
cox.
i
think
what
bothers
me
about
this
is
that
the
commission
found
--
the
commission
in
its
findings
says
that
unless
these
roads
are
protected
during
the
period
necessary
to
determine
their
future,
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
at
this
time
and
now
that's
what
you
have
been
addressing.
your
remarks
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
then
discussed
by
my
brother
stewart
here
in
his
questions.
is
there
anyway
in
which
--
any
condition
that
could
effect
for
any
--
anything
that
could
be
done
to
shore
up
the
interim
for
--
protection
that
would
be
in
effect
now
as
distinguished
from
what
--
it
may
be
an
effect
later
as
a
result
of
the
commission
and
court
action?
justice
abe
fortas
or
anything
that
the
court
could
do
or
both.
the
problem
is
--
the
problem
that's
bothering
--
necessarily
bothersome
in
this
case
is
how
do
you
cope
with
this
finding
of
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
know
you
say
that
the
commission
has
in
effect
the
traffic
condition
and
you
say
that
you
can
rely
upon
the
commission
and
the
court
hereafter
to
supplement
that
with
some
other
kind
of
condition
that's
now
in
the
process
of
hearing.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
well
i
have
taken
hope
and
confident
to
myself
in
the
future
whatever
it
may
be
that
its
still
be
enlist
in
there
if
there
were
some
present
effectuation
in
that
condition,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
yes
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
don't
know
what
that
indemnity
provision
will
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
where
they
send
this
but
they
--
with
these
words
that
quote
on
--
they
said
the
words
that
i
quote
in.
justice
abe
fortas
necessary
not
ineluctable,
unavoidable,
and
inescapable
i
don't
know
but
it
may
be
consequential.
justice
abe
fortas
the
problem
is
how
can
we
be
sure
that
isn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
because
we
don't
have
it
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
we
can't
look
into
them
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
see
what
the
indemnity
provision
will
be?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
on
the
basis
of
your
knowledge
of
the
mechanics
of
this
merger,
assuming
that
it
is
--
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
egg
can
be
unscrambled
--
justice
abe
fortas
cannot
be
unscrambled
--
within
two
years,
three
years?
justice
abe
fortas
when
would
this
exchange
of
securities
take
place?
how
long
would
have
been
before
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
be
six
months
or
year
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox.
mr.
cox,
there
has
not
been
a
plenary
hearing
before
any
court
on
the
premise
of
this
merger?
justice
abe
fortas
there
has
not
been
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
merger
as
judge
fairness,
has
there,
except
for
purposes
of
an
injunction?
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
in
terms
of
statutory
merger
public
interest
standings
of
the
act.
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
proceeding
for
a
temporary
injunction
--
justice
abe
fortas
no
i'm
talking
now
is
about
the
posture
of
this
case
before
us.
suppose
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
what
happens
next?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
court
proceedings,
what
happens
next?
is
--
suppose
a
merger
or
the
mergers
then
consummated
let's
suppose,
are
the
court
proceedings
concluded
forever?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
my
point.
my
point
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
technically
speaking,
what
we
have
before
is
a
temporary
injunction
proceeding,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
technically
speaking,
the
court
below
has
not
passed
in
review
the
commissions
findings
and
conclusions
with
respect
to
this
merger
except
for
purposes
of
the
temporary
injunction?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
it,
may
the
usual
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
auerbach,
if
you
forgive
me
from
going
beyond
your
special
representation
here.
i
was
trying
to
pursue
this
a
little
bit
with
mr.
cox
but
i
was
not
successful
because
the
way
i
--
quote
--
the
way
i
phrased
my
questions.
is
it
possible
for
this
court
in
your
judgment
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
and
at
the
same
time
to
leave
open
the
possibility
and
after
the
commission
enters
its
order
with
respect
to
protective
conditions
for
the
three
roads
that
the
motion
for
temporary
injunction,
if
anybody
wants
to
make
it,
could
be
renewed
and
reconsidered
in
the
three-judge
district
court.
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
before.
have
i
made
my
question
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
--
that's
the
way
to
state
it
broadly.
what
i'm
asking
is
a
very
specific
question.
what
we
have
before
us
now
is
a
denial
of
a
temporary
or
interlocutory
injunction.
now,
that
denial
was
entered
in
the
absence
of
a
final
order
of
the
commission
on
a
private
proceeding.
the
commission,
i'm
troubled
because
the
commission
in
its
findings
said
that
that
--
in
this
inadequate
protective
order
we're
in
it
--
the
commission
would
not
approve
consummation
of
the
merger.
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
it
would
be
possible
as
a
matter
of
law
number
one,
number
two
as
a
matter
of
practicalities
of
the
merger,
one
of
the
following
would
be
possible
that
this
court
approve
--
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
leave
open
the
possibility
that
in
june
or
july
or
whatever
it
is
that
the
commission
enters
its
order
with
respect
to
the
protective
conditions.
the
motion
for
temporary
injunction
can
be
renewed
in
the
three-judge
district
court
at
that
time
and
whether
it
would
still
be
confronted
with
a
--
an
acute
form
of
unscrambling
the
omelet
and
whether
in
those
--
in
those
circumstance,
such
a
procedure
would
be
compatible
with
legal
and
orderly
process.
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
it
--
it
would
be
neither
legal
nor
practical.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
that's
just
great
but
on
page
532
as
i
read
to
mr.

with
its
findings
the
commission
said
unless
they
--
these
three
carriers
i
quote
now,
â€œare
protected

the
period
necessary
to
determine
their
future.
we
would
not
authorize
consummation
at
this
time
even

the
question
is

the
question
is
the
interim
protection.

a
