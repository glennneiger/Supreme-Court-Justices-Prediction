mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
on
behalf
of
milton
j.
shapp,
appellant
in
number
814.
the
relief
we
seek
is
that
this
merger
be
set
aside
in
a
note
in
total.
this
is
not
just
a
railroad
merger.
over
200
corporations
are
being
merged,
if
this
merger
is
approved.
this
merger
of
a
truck
lines,
pipelines,
and
vast
real
estate
holdings
would
be
the
larger
merger
ever
accomplished
in
the
history
of
united
states.
mr.
shapp
has
been
a
persistent
opponent
of
this
merger
ever
since
1962
and
appeared
actively
in
the
proceedings
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
he
and
representatives
of
various
pennsylvania
communities
testified
as
to
the
harm
of
this
merger
with
this
is
it
upon
citizens
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
testified,
cities
of
philadelphia,
pittsburgh,
erie
dozen
of
towns
along
the
pennsylvania
railroad
mainline.
now,
what
does
this
record
show?
it
showed
that
the
basic
plan
for
operating
these
two
parallel
roads
will
reduce
present
pennsylvania
railroad
freight
miles
--
train
miles
by
one-third.
one-third
of
all
the
present
pennsylvania
railroad
freight
trade
miles
will
be
eliminated.
mr.
shapp
and
the
commonwealth
have
testified
--
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
showed
that
35%
of
the
through
freight
trains
operated
in
state
of
pennsylvania
will
be
eliminated.
the
commission
on
that
found
9%.
but
even
9%
of
all
through
freight
trains
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
will
be
eliminated.
now,
what
is
the
basic
plan
of
merger?
the
plan
of
merger
is
to
divert
all
traffic
originating
or
terminating
west
of
youngstown
in
columbus,
ohio
on
the
one
hand
and
north
and
east
of
linden,
new
jersey
on
the
other
hand
divert
this
traffic
which
now
moves
across
state
of
pennsylvania
from
pittsburgh,
philadelphia
and
set
it
up
to
cleveland
to
buffalo
and
across
the
so-called
water
level
route
of
the
new
york
central
to
albany,
passing
through
rochester
and
syracuse.
then
from
albany
then
selkirk
just
below,
albany,
a
huge
new
classification
yard
will
be
built
and
this
traffic
would
come
down
to
new
york
and
the
jersey
metropolitan
area
or
it
could
go
into
new
england,
the
boston
before
the
new
york
central.
so
the
basic
plan
of
merger
is
to
take
away
this
traffic
now
moving
across
pennsylvania
and
route
it
over
the
new
york
central.
and
in
every
major
town
on
the
pennsylvania
railroad
mainline
oppose
this
at
the
icc
and
introduced
testimony.
but
this
merger
does
not
only
hurt
towns
located
on
the
pennsylvania
railroad
mainline.
traffic
will
no
longer
move
between
pittsburgh
and
philadelphia
up
to
new
york.
it
hurts
towns
located
off
the
main
land
of
pennsylvania.
the
city
of
scranton
is
one
example.
commissioner
webb's
report
in
this
plan
in
stock
of
21510
mentioned
moosic
and
north
hampton
in
pennsylvania.
they're
located
off
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
the
technician
finds
that
the
erie-lackawanna
and
delaware
and
hudson
can
survive
this
merger.
now,
scranton
served
by
the
e-l,
d
&
h,
and
c
&
j
and
this
suppose
to
be
included
in
some
other
merger.
so,
if
that
happens,
scranton
instead
of
having
three
railroads
today
will
have
two
railroads
today
and
then
what
happens?
the
norfolk
and
western
and
c
&
o,
they
filed
there
application
for
merger
and
the
c
&
j,
the
jersey
central
is
suppose
to
go
into
that.
so
instead
of
scranton
now
enjoined
three
competitive
railroads,
it's
going
to
have
one.
but
none
of
this
adequate
competitive
impact
which
the
lower
court
says
it's
going
to
be
with
clairvoyance
was
evaluated
in
passing
upon
the
penn-central
merger.
therefore,
we
have
the
case-by-case
approach
where
towns
like
scranton,
moosic
and
i
might
say
that
mr.
webb
didn't
mention
it
but
there
are
eight
counties
in
pennsylvania
who
participates
--
who
are
parties
in
that
report
that
he
issued
in
december
and
three
cities.
you'll
only
find
two,
you
have
mentioned.
there's
a
lot
of
people
throughout
pennsylvania
very
much
interested
in
this
merger.
now,
the
fact
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
commission
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
he's
not
a
shipper.
he's
not
a
carrier.
the
commission
announced
they
were
going
to
have
hearings
in
philadelphia
and
in
pennsylvania,
was
open
to
the
public
and
a
lot
of
members
of
the
public
came.
there's
a
few
retired
railroad
workers
and
other
people,
and
these
are
citizens
because
he's
going
to
be
damaged.
and
no
one
has
ever
challenged
his
standing
anywhere.
we
got
these
briefs
last
friday
and
it's
impossible
for
me
to
go
through
professor
jacques'
works
and
other
citations
and
to
answer
the
legal
arguments
raised
on
his
standing
to
sue.
i
can
say
it
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
specifically
brought
up
to
the
lower
court.
judge
asked
nobody
made
an
objection
but
one
all
the
way
up
here
to
the
supreme
court.
he
does
have
standing.
any
merger
that's
going
to
have
this
impact
on
the
state
of
pennsylvania
where
you're
going
to
loss
9
or
35%
of
your
freight
train
miles,
where
your
two
traffics
is
going
to
be
send
up
to
another
state,
where
your
citizens
are
--
and
the
shippers
and
the
whole
economies
is
going
to
have
to
subsidies
the
commuters
in
fairfield
county,
connecticut
to
get
to
the
jobs
and
rival
new
york.
any
merger
of
this
type
is
very
damaging
to
the
citizens
of
pennsylvania
and
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth
and
the
city
of
philadelphia,
city
of
pittsburgh,
do
their
act
of
opposition
indicates
the
pressure
or
not
the
pressure
but
the
influence
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
not
that
the
witnesses,
these
expert
witnesses
at
the
commonwealth
put
on
are
anyway
wrong.
i
might
say,
it's
quite
mr.
keyserling
already
mention
it,
the
department
of
justice,
two-and-a-half
years
ago
filed
a
270-page
brief.
opposing
this
merger
in
its
entirety,
270
pages
and
on
the
basis
of
that
270-page
brief,
they
made
an
argument
and
all
argument
14
months
to
go
in
complete
opposition
of
this
merger.
and
i
still
don't
know
eventhough
he's
on
the
same
side
what
united
states
thinks
about
the
appeals
raised
by
mr.
shapp
or
city
of
scranton.
they've
deferred
any
comment
on
it.
they
have
footnotes
on
it.
we
don't
know
what
their
position
is.
we'd
like
to
know
why.
well,
maybe
they
won't
take
a
position
but
we
don't
know
why
the
department
of
justice
isn't
still
fighting
this
merger
because
certainly
today
is
less
--
there
is
much
less
justification
for
it
than
it
was
before.
now,
i
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
a
word
that
hasn't
been
mention
and
that's
the
public
interest.
and
the
basic
legal
reason
why
we
think
this
merger
is
erroneous
was
that
the
icc,
deploy
--
employed
the
test
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
the
test
that
you
construed
in
1932
in
the
new
york
city
security
corporation
tests,
but
that
test
is
out
of
date
in
our
judgment
because
the
transportation
act
of
1940
which
is
construed
in
mclean
decision
pose
that
they're
different
criteria.
but
before
it
was
a
judicially
construed
for
criteria
the
public
interest
which
is
1932
are
now
statutory
and
these
four
criteria
are
different.
and
the
commission
has
not
considered
the
impact
of
this
merger
upon
the
employees
of
railroads
that
it
will
be
heard
by
employees
of
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h,
c
&
j
instead
the
fourth
criteria
doesn't
apply.
it's
not
that
to
--
it's
too
remote.
yet,
it's
very
remote
from
security
holders,
i
mean
its
remote
for
the
security
holders
of
these
railroads
they
get
elaborate
conditions
that's
suppose
to
be
included
indemnity,
all
sorts
of
things.
yet
the
employees
are
not
to
be
considered.
we
don't
know
what
the
total
fix
charges
are
going
to
be
from
this
merger.
if
that's
specific
criteria
at
the
present
section
5
(2)
of
the
act
because
the
new
haven
--
we
don't
know
what
the
price
of
the
new
haven
is
going
to
be.
then
we
have
the
national
defense.
they
didn't
solicit
testimony
from
the
department
of
defense.
yet,
we
--
here
we
are
at
war
in
vietnam
and
we're
going
to
have
a
drastic
collapse
in
railroad
facilities
at
budgeting
ton
miles
from
the
present
89
billion
according
to
the
commission.
66
billion
or
64
billion
have
tremendous
drop
in
traffic
or
the
defense
implications.
yet
the
national
transportation
policy
exists
today
or
did
not
exist
in
1920.
we
have
according
to
the
opinion
of
mclean
to
look
at
other
legislation.
we
have
the
passenger
train
discontinuance
act
of
1958
which
says
that
the
shippers
afraid
are
not
to
subsidized
passenger
service.
if
what
else
is
this
new
haven
inclusion?
we
have
the
commission
saying
that
the
impact
of
this
merger
on
towns
and
communities
with
respect
to
employment,
taxation,
and
local
businesses
is
not
to
be
included
at
all.
it's
irrelevant.
when
we
have
hundreds
of
communities
that
have
opposed
this
merger,
hundreds
of
them.
you
look
and
examine
the
report
and
even
though
they're
not
here
today,
they
are
in
opposition
and
to
suggest
in
view
of
the
appalachian
regional
development
act
which
involved
city
of
scranton,
it
was
in
it,
means
it
doesn't
apply
that
we
could
just
have
a
merger
and
not
even
consider
employment
or
taxation
were
the
effect
on
local
business.
so
our
main
point,
i'd
like
to
leave
with
you
is
that
the
standard
which
the
commission
used
in
this
case.
the
new
york
central
security's
corporation
test
as
they
referred
on
in
the
briefs
to
you
is
just
erroneous
as
the
matter
of
law.
the
last
thing
i
like
to
briefly
mention
is
competition.
and
in
addition
to
not
considering
the
addressed
impact
on
these
other
railroads
as
part
of
the
competition
to
be
appraised
and
the
lost
of
service
to
towns
like
scranton
by
inclusion
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
the
commission
failed
to
include
market
competition
and
that
derives
from
the
opinion
that
in
the
seaboard
case
a
year
ago.
and
this
in
some
thought
the
transportation
standards
rather
than
the
brown
shoes
standard
should
apply.
well,
if
transportation
standards
are
involved,
we
have
them
at
the
commission.
we
have
market
competition
and
carrier
corporate
competition.
we
have
them
for
a
number
of
section
7
cases.
but
the
commission
is
going
to
appraise
the
extent
of
competition
they're
going
to
use
market
competition.
an
example
of
that
is
wheat
cargo
co.
how
about
the
basing
point
decisions?
the
cement
industry
up
in
the
lehigh
hudson
valley
district
versus
the
cement
industry
in
pennsylvania
in
the
hudson
--
in
the
lehigh
district
both
of
these
two
cement
producing
areas
located
on
different
railroads
competing
for
common
markets.
commission
holds
as
a
matter
of
law
in
this
report
on
reconsideration
that
this
competition
need
not
be
considered.
well,
in
our
judgment
this
merger
should
be
anulled
and
set
aside.
i'd
like
to
leave
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
on

of
milton
j.
shapp,
appellant
in
number
814.
the
relief
we
seek
is
that
this

people
throughout
pennsylvania
very
much
interested
in
this
merger.
now,
the
fact
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
commission
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
he's
not
a
shipper.
he's
not
a
carrier.
the
commission
announced
they
were
going
to
have
hearings
in
philadelphia
and
in
pennsylvania,
was
open
to
the
public
and
a
lot
of
members
of
the
public
came.
there's
a
few
retired
railroad
workers
and
other
people,
and
these
are
citizens
because
he's
going
to
be
damaged.
and
no
one
has
ever
challenged
his
standing
anywhere.
we
got
these
briefs
last
friday
and
it's
impossible
for
me
to
go
through
professor
jacques'
works
and
other
citations
and
to
answer
the
legal
arguments
raised
on
his
standing
to
sue.
i
can
say
it
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
specifically
brought
up
to
the
lower
court.
judge
asked
nobody
made
an
objection
but
one
all
the
way
up
here
to
the
supreme
court.
he
does
have
standing.
any
merger
that's
going
to
have
this
impact
on
the
state
of
pennsylvania
where
you're
going
to
loss
9
or
35%
of
your
freight
train
miles,
where
your
two
traffics
is
going
to
be
send
up
to
another
state,
where
your
citizens
are
--
and
the
shippers
and
the
whole
economies
is
going
to
have
to
subsidies
the
commuters
in
fairfield
county,
connecticut
to
get
to
the
jobs
and
rival
new
york.
any
merger
of
this
type
is
very
damaging
to
the
citizens
of
pennsylvania
and
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth
and
the
city
of
philadelphia,
city
of
pittsburgh,
do
their
act
of
opposition
indicates
the
pressure
or
not
the
pressure
but
the
influence
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
not
that
the
witnesses,
these
expert
witnesses
at
the
commonwealth
put
on
are
anyway
wrong.
i
might
say,
it's
quite
mr.
keyserling
already
mention
it,
the
department
of
justice,
two-and-a-half
years
ago
filed
a
270-page
brief.
opposing
this
merger
in
its
entirety,
270
pages
and
on
the
basis
of
that
270-page
brief,
they
made
an
argument
and
all
argument
14
months
to
go
in
complete
opposition
of
this
merger.
and
i
still
don't
know
eventhough
he's
on
the
same
side
what
united
states
thinks
about
the
appeals
raised
by
mr.
shapp
or
city
of
scranton.
they've
deferred
any
comment
on
it.
they
have
footnotes
on
it.
we
don't
know
what
their
position
is.
we'd
like
to
know
why.
well,
maybe
they
won't
take
a
position
but
we
don't
know
why
the
department
of
justice
isn't
still
fighting
this
merger
because
certainly
today
is
less
--
there
is
much
less
justification
for
it
than
it
was
before.
now,
i
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
a
word
that
hasn't
been
mention
and
that's
the
public
interest.
and
the
basic
legal
reason
why
we
think
this
merger
is
erroneous
was
that
the
icc,
deploy
--
employed
the
test
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
the
test
that
you
construed
in
1932
in
the
new
york
city
security
corporation
tests,
but
that
test
is
out
of
date
in
our
judgment
because
the
transportation
act
of
1940
which
is
construed
in
mclean
decision
pose
that
they're
different
criteria.
but
before
it
was
a
judicially
construed
for
criteria
the
public
interest
which
is
1932
are
now
statutory
and
these
four
criteria
are
different.
and
the
commission
has
not
considered
the
impact
of
this
merger
upon
the
employees
of
railroads
that
it
will
be
heard
by
employees
of
erie-lackawanna,
d
&
h,
c
&
j
instead
the
fourth
criteria
doesn't
apply.
it's
not
that
to
--
it's
too
remote.
yet,
it's
very
remote
from
security
holders,
i
mean
its
remote
for
the
security
holders
of
these
railroads
they
get
elaborate
conditions
that's
suppose
to
be
included
indemnity,
all
sorts
of
things.
yet
the
employees
are
not
to
be
considered.
we
don't
know
what
the
total
fix
charges
are
going
to
be
from
this
merger.
if
that's
specific
criteria
at
the
present
section
5
(2)
of
the
act
because
the
new
haven
--
we
don't
know
what
the
price
of
the
new
haven
is
going
to
be.
then
we
have
the
national
defense.
they
didn't
solicit
testimony
from
the
department
of
defense.
yet,
we
--
here
we
are
at
war
in
vietnam
and
we're
going
to
have
a
drastic
collapse
in
railroad
facilities
at
budgeting
ton
miles
from
the
present
89
billion
according
to
the
commission.
66
billion
or
64
billion
have
tremendous
drop
in
traffic
or
the
defense
implications.
yet
the
national
transportation
policy
exists
today
or
did
not
exist
in
1920.
we
have
according
to
the
opinion
of
mclean
to
look
at
other
legislation.
we
have
the
passenger
train
discontinuance
act
of
1958
which
says
that
the
shippers
afraid
are
not
to
subsidized
passenger
service.
if
what
else
is
this
new
haven
inclusion?
we
have
the
commission
saying
that
the
impact
of
this
merger
on
towns
and
communities
with
respect
to
employment,
taxation,
and
local
businesses
is
not
to
be
included
at
all.
it's
irrelevant.
when
we
have
hundreds
of
communities
that
have
opposed
this
merger,
hundreds
of
them.
you
look
and
examine
the
report
and
even
though
they're
not
here
today,
they
are
in
opposition
and
to
suggest
in
view
of
the
appalachian
regional
development
act
which
involved
city
of
scranton,
it
was
in
it,
means
it
doesn't
apply
that
we
could
just
have
a
merger
and
not
even
consider
employment
or
taxation
were
the
effect
on
local
business.
so
our
main
point,
i'd
like
to
leave
with
you
is
that
the
standard
which
the
commission
used
in
this
case.
the
new
york
central
security's
corporation
test
as
they
referred
on
in
the
briefs
to
you
is
just
erroneous
as
the
matter
of
law.
the
last
thing
i
like
to
briefly
mention
is
competition.
and
in
addition
to
not
considering
the
addressed
impact
on
these
other
railroads
as
part
of
the
competition
to
be
appraised
and
the
lost
of
service
to
towns
like
scranton
by
inclusion
in
the
norfolk
and
western
system.
the
commission
failed
to
include
market
competition
and
that
derives
from
the
opinion
that
in
the
seaboard
case
a
year
ago.
and
this
in
some
thought
the
transportation
standards
rather
than
the
brown
shoes
standard
should
apply.
well,
if
transportation
standards
are
involved,
we
have
them
at
the
commission.
we
have
market
competition
and
carrier
corporate
competition.
we
have
them
for
a
number
of
section
7
cases.
but
the
commission
is
going
to
appraise
the
extent
of
competition
they're
going
to
use
market
competition.
an
example
of
that
is
wheat
cargo
co.
how
about
the
basing
point
decisions?
the
cement
industry
up
in
the
lehigh
hudson
valley
district
versus
the
cement
industry
in
pennsylvania
in
the
hudson
--
in
the
lehigh
district
both
of
these
two
cement
producing
areas
located
on
different
railroads
competing
for
common
markets.
commission
holds
as
a
matter
of
law
in
this
report
on
reconsideration
that
this
competition
need
not
be
considered.
well,
in
our
judgment
this
merger
should
be
anulled
and
set
aside.
i'd
like
to
leave
some
time
for
rebuttal.
