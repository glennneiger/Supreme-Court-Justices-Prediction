mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
divide
the
argument.
accordingly,
i
will
handle
the
equal
protection
argument
as
we
view
it
and
mr.
cohen
will
argue
the
due
process
argument.
you
have
before
you
today
what
we
consider
the
most
odious
of
the
segregation
laws
and
the
slavery
laws
and
our
view
of
this
law,
we
hope
to
clearly
show
is
that
this
is
a
slavery
law.
we
referred
to
the
law
itself
--
oh
at
first,
i'd
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention,
there
are
some
discrepancy
in
the
briefs
between
us
and
the
common
law
especially
as
to
which
laws
are
in
essence.
they
have
particularly
said
that
section
20-58
and
20-59
of
the
virginia
code
are
the
only
things
for
consideration
by
this
court,
and
those
two
sections,
of
course,
are
the
criminal
section,
making
a
criminal
penalty
for
negro
and
white
to
intermarry
in
the
state
of
virginia.
20-58
is
the
evasion
section
under
which
this
case
particularly
arose
which
makes
it
a
criminal
act
to
people
who
go
outside
the
state
to
avoid
the
laws
of
virginia
to
get
married.
we
contend,
however,
your
honors
that
there
is
much
more
in
essence
here.
that
there's
actually
one
simple
issue,
and
the
issue
is,
may
a
state
proscribe
a
marriage
between
two
adult
consenting
individuals
because
of
their
race
and
this
would
take
in
much
more
in
the
virginia
statutes.
sections
20-54
and
20-57
void
such
marriages
and
if
they
void
such
marriages,
you
would
only
decide
on
20-58
and
20-59,
these
people,
whether
they
go
back
to
virginia
and
they
are
in
virginia
now,
will
be
subject
to
immediate
arrest
under
the
fornest
--
fornication
statute,
and
the
lewd
and
lascivious
cohabitation
statute
and
more
than
that,
there
are
many,
many
other
problems
with
this.
their
children
would
be
declared
bastards
under
many
virginia
decisions.
they
themselves
would
lose
their
rights
for
insurance,
social
security
and
numerous
other
things
to
which
they're
entitled.
so
we
strongly
urge
the
court
considering
this
to
consider
this
basic
question,
may
the
state
proscribe
a
marriage
between
such
individuals
because
of
their
race
and
their
race
alone.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
there
are
16
states,
your
honors
that
have
these
states.
presently,
maryland
just
repealed
theirs.
these
all
are
southern
states
with
four
or
five
border
southern
states
as
oklahoma
and
missouri,
and
delaware.
there
have
been
in
recent
years
two
oklahoma
and
missouri
that
have
had
bills
to
repeal
them
but
they
did
not
pass
the
statute.
now,
in
dealing
with
the
equal
protection
argument,
we
feel
that
on
its
face,
on
its
face,
these
laws
violate
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
in
dealing
this,
we
look
at
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
state
and
there're
basically
two
arguments
advanced
by
the
state.
on
one
hand,
they
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
specifically
exempted
marriage
from
its
limitations.
on
the
other
hand,
they
say
if
it
didn't,
the
maynard
versus
hill
doctrine
would
apply
here,
that
this
is
only
for
the
state
to
legislate
them.
in
replying
to
that,
we
think
their
health
and
welfare
aspect
of
it
is
in
essence
and
we
hope
to
show
to
the
court,
these
are
not
health
and
welfare
laws.
these
are
slavery
laws
pure
and
simple.
now
for
this
reason,
we
went
to
some
length
in
our
brief
to
go
into
the
history
of
these
laws,
to
look
at
why
virginia
passed
these
laws
and
why
other
states
have
these
laws
on
a
books
and
how
they
used
these
laws.
without
reiterating
what
is
in
the
brief,
i
will
just
refer
to
that
history
very
briefly.
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
laws
go
back
to
the
1600s.
the
1691
act
is
the
first
basic
act
we
have.
there
was
a
1662
act
which
held
that
the
child
of
a
negro
woman
and
a
white
man
would
be
free
or
slave
according
to
the
condition
of
his
mother.
it's
a
slavery
law
and
it
was
only
concerned
with
one
thing,
and
it's
an
important
element
in
this
matter.
negro
man,
white
woman,
that's
all
they
were
really
concerned
with.
i
think
maybe
all
these
still
concern
with.
it's
purely
the
white
woman,
not
purely
the
negro
woman.
these
laws
robbed
the
negro
race
of
their
dignity.
it's
the
worst
part
of
these
laws
and
that's
what
they're
meant
to
do,
to
hold
the
negro
class
in
a
lower
position,
lower
social
position,
the
lower
economic
position.
1691
was
the
first
basic
act
and
it
was
entitled
an
act
for
this
pressing
of
outline
slaves
and
the
language
of
the
act
is
important
while
we
go
back
to
it
because
they
talk
about
the
prevention
of
bad
abominable
mixture
and
spurious
issue
and
we'll
see
that
language
time
and
again
throughout
all
the
judicial
decisions
referred
to
by
the
state.
and
then
they
went
into
two
centuries
of
trying
to
figure
out
who
these
people
were
that
they
were
proscribing.
i
won't
touch
upon
all
the
states.
i
understand
amicus
will
do
that.
but
at
one
time,
in
1705
it
was
a
person
with
one-eight
or
more
negro
blood
and
then
in
1785,
it
became
person
with
one
quarter
or
more
and
it
went
on
and
on.
it
wasn't
until
1930
that
we
finally
arrived
that
what
a
negro
is
in
the
state
of
virginia,
that's
a
person
with
any
traceable
negro
blood,
a
matter
which
we
think
defies
any
scientific
interpretation.
and
the
first
real
judicial
decision
we
get
in
virginia
was
in
1878
when
the
kinney
versus
commonwealth
case
came
down.
and
there
again,
we
have
a
very
interesting
decision
because
in
kinney
versus
commonwealth,
they
talk
about
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
virginia.
now
what
that
public
policy
was
and
how
would
it
be
applied?
if
your
honors
will
indulge
me,
i
have
the
language
here
which
is
the
language
that
had
carried
through,
through
the
history
of
virginia.
and
they
talk
about
spurious
issue
again,
and
that
is
what's
constantly
carried
through
and
carried
through
for
an
act
to
suppressing
of
outlawing
slaves.
and
they
talk
about
the
church
southern
civilization,
but
they
didn't
speak
about
the
southern
civilization
as
a
whole
but
this
white
southern
civilization.
and
they
want
the
race
as
kept
distinct
and
separate,
the
same
thing
this
court
has
heard
since
brown
and
before
brown,
but
it's
heard
so
many
times
during
the
brown
argument
and
since
the
brown
argument.
and
they
talk
about
alliances
so
unnatural
that
god
has
forbidden
them
and
this
language
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that's
kinney
versus
commonwealth,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
kinney,
k-i-n-n-e-y
and
then
in
1924,
in
the
period
of
great
history
in
the
united
states,
the
historical
period
we're
all
familiar
with,
a
period
when
the
west
was
in
arms
over
the
yellow
peril
and
western
states
were
thinking
about
these
laws
or
some
(inaudible),
a
period
when
the
immigration
laws
were
being
passed
to
the
united
states
because
the
north
was
worried
about
the
great
influx
of
italian
immigrants
and
irish
immigrants,
a
period
when
the
klan
rode
openly
in
the
south
and
that's
when
they
talked
about
bastardy
of
races,
and
miscegenation
and
amalgamation
and
race
suicide
became
the
watch
word,
and
john
powell,
a
man
we
singled
out
in
our
brief,
a
noted
pianist
of
his
day,
started
taking
up
the
darwin
theory
and
perverting
it
through
the
theory
of
eugenics,
the
theory
that
applied
to
animals,
to
pigs,
and
hogs,
and
cattle.
they
started
applying
it
to
human
beings.
in
taking
darwinism
that
the
negro
race
was
a
stepping
stone,
was
that
lost
men
we've
always
been
looking
for
between
the
white
man
and
the
abominable
snowman
whoever
else,
they
went
back.
and
that's
when
the
anglo-saxon
club
was
formed
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
that's
when
virginia
legislature
passed
our
present
body
of
law.
they
took
all
these
old
laws.
these
antebellum
and
postbellum
laws
and
they
put
them
together
into
what
we
presently
have.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
your
honor,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
basically
most
states
had
them.
it
was
just
virginia
and
then
georgia
copied
the
virginia
act
which
had
such
a
complete
act
and
it
was
described
in
many
places
as
the
most
perfect
model
with
this
type
of
act.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
most
--
no
your
honor,
most
of
them
actually
had
them
on
the
books.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
--
with
summary
codification,
this
one
virginia
strove
to
do
this
to
make
a
perfect
model
law
and
only
georgia
thought
it
was
expected
from
our
reading
of
history
that
many
other
states
would
follow
but
they
just
let
remain
what
they
had.
there
was
very
few
repeals
on
those
days.
actually,
the
great
body
of
repeal
has
been
since
brown
with
13
states
have
repealed
since
that
time.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
because
some
of
the
statutes
we
have
were
enacted
then,
all
the
registration
statutes
were
enacted
in
1924
your
honor.
these
are
the
statutes
basically
which
you
have
to
have
a
--
a
certificate
of
racial
composition
in
the
state
of
virginia.
the
statutes
which
we
find
absolutely
mostly
odious,
the
statutes
will
reflect
back
the
nazi
germany
and
to
the
present
south
african
situation.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
but
the
present
bill,
as
it
is
on
the
books
is
that
law
from
1924
and
it
was
entitled
"a
bill
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
white
race"
when
it
was
initially
issued.
it
was
passed
as
a
bill
for
racial
integrity
--
to
preserve
racial
integrity.
now,
we
would
advance
the
argument
very
strongly
to
the
court,
they're
not
concerned
with
racial
integrity
of
the
negro
race,
only
with
the
white
race.
in
fact
in
virginia,
it's
only
a
crime
for
white
and
negro
to
intermarry
and
the
lowest
couch
in
such
terms
that
they
say,
"white
may
only
marry
white"
in
section
20-54
of
our
law,
but
it
goes
on
from
there
to
make
it
a
crime
only
for
whites
and
negroes
to
intermarry.
there's
no
crime
for
malaysian
to
marry
a
negro
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
valid
marriage
in
virginia
but
it
would
be
a
void
marriage
for
malaysian
or
any
other
race
aside
from
negro
to
marry
a
white
person.
a
void
marriage
but
there'd
be
no
criminal
penalty
against
anyone
but
the
white
person.
they
were
not
concerned
with
the
racial
integrity
but
racial
supremacy
of
the
white
race.
in
1930,
they
finally,
as
i
said
before,
went
on,
say
any
person
with
traceable
negro
blood
with
a
negro.
now,
these
laws,
your
honors,
are
ludicrous
in
their
inception
and
equally
ludicrous
in
their
application.
it's
not
possible
to
look
at
just
the
virginia
laws
alone.
you
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
the
whole
south
we
feel
and
the
classifications
in
the
south.
it's
impossible
to
say.
i
won't
go
to
again,
the
exact
illustration
of
negroes
but
south
carolina,
north
carolina
make
certain
indians
white
people.
north
carolina,
cherokee
and
robeson
county
is
a
white
person,
all
of
the
cherokee
indians,
and
negroes.
in
south
carolina
is
the
kato
indians
and
these
laws
came
to
invent
to
these
other
very
hateful
laws.
in
mississippi
advocate
of
social
equality
under
the
mis
--
miscegenation
body
of
law.
it's
a
criminal
penalty.
i
think
it
carries
one
to
five
years.
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
several
decisions
handed
out
by
states
which
again
point
out
the
racial
feeling
concerning
these
laws.
the
missouri
laws
bottomed
on
states
versus
jackson
which
basically
held
that
if
the
progeny
of
a
mixed
marriage,
married
the
progeny
of
a
mixed
marriage,
there'd
be
no
further
progeny
and
fundamentally
ridiculous
statement.
maybe
it
wasn't
for
those
men
in
that
day
and
age
but
it
certainly
is
now
and
georgia
has
an
equally
ridiculous
basis
for
the
laws.
in
scott
versus
georgia
where
they
held
that
from
the
daily
observances,
they
see
that
the
offspring
of
such
marriages
are
feminine.
and
in
this
case,
and
i
will
refer
to
the
appellant's
brief
here
at
page
35,
the
loving
case
comes
to
you
based
on
the
case
of
name
versus
name.
now,
what
were
they
talking
about
in
name
versus
name?
again,
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
racial
integrity
of
their
citizens.
they
want
not
to
have
a
mongrel
breed
of
citizens.
we
find
there
no
requirement
that
the
state
shall
not
legislate
to
prevent
the
obliteration
of
racial
pride
but
must
permit
the
corruption
of
blood
even
though
it
weakens
or
destroy
the
quality
of
the
citizenship.
these
are
racial
and
equal
protection
thoroughly
proscribes
these.
in
the
case
before
you,
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
judge
bazile,
and
we
have
the
footnote
in
page
37
of
our
brief,
which
says,
"almighty
god
created
the
right
races,
white,
black,
yellow,
malay,
and
red
and
he
placed
them
on
separate
continents,"
and
i
didn't
read
the
whole
quote,
but
it's
a
fundamentally
ludicrous
quote
and
again,
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
we
feel
the
very
basic
wrong
of
these
statutes
is
they
rob
the
negro
race
of
their
dignity
and
fundamental
in
the
concept
of
liberty
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
dignity
of
the
individual,
because
without
that,
there
is
no
ordered
liberty.
we've
quoted
from
numerous
authorities
and
particularly
not
for
the
scientific
point
but
particularly,
i
refer
you
to
the
quotes
from
gunner
murdel
who's
made
a
noted
study
in
recent
years
of
this,
and
not
the
old
studies
that
are
otherwise
quoted.
your
honor
please,
there's
one
other
issue
that
the
state
raises
that
i
will
touch
on
briefly,
and
that's
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue.
to
begin
with
the
state
advances,
no
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
debates
themselves.
they
go
to
the
debates
of
the
1866
act
and
the
freedmen's
bureau
bills
which
did
immediately
precede
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
in
their
own
brief,
they
have
an
excellent
cite
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
impart
designed
to
provide
a
firm
constitutional
basis
for
the
civil
rights
act.
we
would
advance
that
the
in
part
is
the
answer
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
even
if
you
read
in
the
history,
the
1866
act,
it's
much
broader
in
scope.
its
language
is
much
broader
in
the
scope.
the
language
of
liberty,
due
process
is
much
broader
than
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
that
were
put
in
to
the
1866
legislative
act.
it
was
more
than
an
effort
to
put
these
laws
beyond
the
grasp
before
the
congress.
it
was
a
greater
protection.
and
your
honor
please,
even
if
you
want
to
take
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866,
we
feel
even
reading
that
language,
that
wasn't
clear.
it's
up
to
the
court
to
decide
what
happened.
many
legislators
felt
it
would
proscribe,
that
the
civil
rights
act
itself,
would
proscribe
this
type
of
laws
in
the
states.
even
various
proponents
said
amalgamation
laws
were
now
touched
and
basically
what
they
rely
on
in
their
brief,
and
in
their
argument
in
the
court
below,
and
i
might
point
out
to
your
honors
that
this
was
argued
fully
in
the
court
below
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
didn't
base
the
rule
on
the
argument,
but
push
to
the
side
and
went
to
the
merits
of
whether
these
laws
were
or
were
not
unconstitutional,
taking
into
account
before
taking
them.
as
i
recall,
this
was
put
before
this
court
in
the
mclaughlin
case,
well
i
know
it
was
and
it
was
put
before
the
lower
court
in
mclaughlin
cases,
the
same
argument.
now
while
mclaughlin
was
cohabitation,
i
think
you'd
have
to
read
those
laws
together
if
they
were
intended
to
be
reached
because
they
spoke
of
amalgamation
laws
in
the
arguments
of
the
1866
act.
but
even
if
you
would
read
the
language
of
senator
trumbull
which
they
rely
on
so
strongly,
what
did
he
really
say?
well,
one
point
page
17
in
their
brief,
he
says,
"i
presume
there
is
no
discrimination
in
this
respect"
and
he
goes
on
to
talk
about
his
argument,
the
law
as
i
understand
it
in
all
states
applies
equally.
this
was
the
pace
reasoning
which
this
court
has
set
aside,
but
the
real
tip
off
we
feel
on
this
comes
on
page
22
where
they're
quoting
trumbull
again.
and
he
says,
"this
bill
would
not
repeal
the
law
to
which
the
senator
refers,"
in
reply
to
senator
johnson,
"if
there
is
no
discrimination
made
by
it,
if
there
is
no
discrimination
made
by
it."
we
submit
very
strongly
as
it
had
been
before
the
court
many
times
that
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
an
open-ended
application
even
on
these
laws,
even
when
we
had
this
argument,
because
this
is
if
it's
not
discriminatory,
your
honors
must
reach
the
conclusion
whether
it's
discriminatory
or
not
and
it
is
clearly
discriminatory.
we
speak
of
this
on
page
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
quoting
bickel,
a
noted
constitutional
authority.
he
said,
"they
were
open-ended
and
meant
to
be
expanded
in
light
of
changing
times
and
circumstances"
and
quoting
this
court
from
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority,
"its
constitutional
assurance
was
reserved
in
terms
of
imprecision
was
necessary
if
the
right
were
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
variety
of
individual
state
relations."
there
are
any
number
of
such
quotes
in
your
opinions
in
the
last
ten
years.
the
same
argument
you
had
before
you
all
the
time
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
your
honors
very
adequately
answered
that
argument
in
the
mclaughlin
decision
when
you
said,
"this
was
essential
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment"
and
we
submit
very
strongly,
it
is
the
essential
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
your
honors
please
in
resting
on
the
equal
protection
argument,
we
fail
to
see
how
any
reasonable
man
can
but
conclude
that
these
laws
are
slavery
laws
were
incepted
to
keep
the
slaves
in
their
place,
were
prolonged
to
keep
the
slaves
in
their
place,
and
in
truth,
the
virginia
law
still
views
the
negro
race
as
a
slave
race,
that
these
are
the
most
odious
laws
to
come
before
the
court.
they
robbed
the
negro
race
of
its
dignity
and
only
a
decision
which
will
reach
the
full
body
of
these
laws
in
the
state
of
virginia
will
change
that.
we
ask
that
the
court
consider
the
full
spectrum
of
these
laws
and
not
just
the
criminality,
because
it's
more
than
a
criminality
that's
at
point
here,
that
the
legitimacy
of
children
right
to
inherent
land,
the
many,
many
rights,
and
in
reaching
a
decision,
we
ask
you
reach
on
that
basis.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
divide
the
argument.
accordingly,
i
will
handle
the
equal
protection
argument
as
we
view
it
and
mr.
cohen
will
argue
the
due
process
argument.
you
have
before
you
today
what
we
consider
the
most
odious
of
the
segregation
laws
and
the
slavery
laws
and
our
view
of
this
law,
we
hope
to
clearly
show
is
that
this
is
a
slavery
law.
we
referred
to
the
law
itself
--
oh
at
first,
i'd
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention,
there
are
some
discrepancy
in
the
briefs
between
us
and
the
common
law
especially
as
to
which
laws
are
in
essence.
they
have
particularly
said
that
section
20-58
and
20-59
of
the
virginia
code
are
the
only
things
for
consideration
by
this
court,
and
those
two
sections,
of
course,
are
the
criminal
section,
making
a
criminal
penalty
for
negro
and
white
to
intermarry
in
the
state
of
virginia.
20-58
is
the
evasion
section
under
which
this
case
particularly
arose
which
makes
it
a
criminal
act
to
people
who
go
outside
the
state
to
avoid
the
laws
of
virginia
to
get
married.
we
contend,
however,
your
honors
that
there
is
much
more
in
essence
here.
that
there's
actually
one
simple
issue,
and
the
issue
is,
may
a
state
proscribe
a
marriage
between
two
adult
consenting
individuals
because
of
their
race
and
this
would
take
in
much
more
in
the
virginia
statutes.
sections
20-54
and
20-57
void
such
marriages
and
if
they
void
such
marriages,
you
would
only
decide
on
20-58
and
20-59,
these
people,
whether
they
go
back
to
virginia
and
they
are
in
virginia
now,
will
be
subject
to
immediate
arrest
under
the
fornest
--
fornication
statute,
and
the
lewd
and
lascivious
cohabitation
statute
and
more
than
that,
there
are
many,
many
other
problems
with
this.
their
children
would
be
declared
bastards
under
many
virginia
decisions.
they
themselves
would
lose
their
rights
for
insurance,
social
security
and
numerous
other
things
to
which
they're
entitled.
so
we
strongly
urge
the
court
considering
this
to
consider
this
basic
question,
may
the
state
proscribe
a
marriage
between
such
individuals
because
of
their
race
and
their
race
alone.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
there
are
16
states,
your
honors
that
have
these
states.
presently,
maryland
just
repealed
theirs.
these
all
are
southern
states
with
four
or
five
border
southern
states
as
oklahoma
and
missouri,
and
delaware.
there
have
been
in
recent
years
two
oklahoma
and
missouri
that
have
had
bills
to
repeal
them
but
they
did
not
pass
the
statute.
now,
in
dealing
with
the
equal
protection
argument,
we
feel
that
on
its
face,
on
its
face,
these
laws
violate
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
in
dealing
this,
we
look
at
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
state
and
there're
basically
two
arguments
advanced
by
the
state.
on
one
hand,
they
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
specifically
exempted
marriage
from
its
limitations.
on
the
other
hand,
they
say
if
it
didn't,
the
maynard
versus
hill
doctrine
would
apply
here,
that
this
is
only
for
the
state
to
legislate
them.
in
replying
to
that,
we
think
their
health
and
welfare
aspect
of
it
is
in
essence
and
we
hope
to
show
to
the
court,
these
are
not
health
and
welfare
laws.
these
are
slavery
laws
pure
and
simple.
now
for
this
reason,
we
went
to
some
length
in
our
brief
to
go
into
the
history
of
these
laws,
to
look
at
why
virginia
passed
these
laws
and
why
other
states
have
these
laws
on
a
books
and
how
they
used
these
laws.
without
reiterating
what
is
in
the
brief,
i
will
just
refer
to
that
history
very
briefly.
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
laws
go
back
to
the
1600s.
the
1691
act
is
the
first
basic
act
we
have.
there
was
a
1662
act
which
held
that
the
child
of
a
negro
woman
and
a
white
man
would
be
free
or
slave
according
to
the
condition
of
his
mother.
it's
a
slavery
law
and
it
was
only
concerned
with
one
thing,
and
it's
an
important
element
in
this
matter.
negro
man,
white
woman,
that's
all
they
were
really
concerned
with.
i
think
maybe
all
these
still
concern
with.
it's
purely
the
white
woman,
not
purely
the
negro
woman.
these
laws
robbed
the
negro
race
of
their
dignity.
it's
the
worst
part
of
these
laws
and
that's
what
they're
meant
to
do,
to
hold
the
negro
class
in
a
lower
position,
lower
social
position,
the
lower
economic
position.
1691
was
the
first
basic
act
and
it
was
entitled
an
act
for
this
pressing
of
outline
slaves
and
the
language
of
the
act
is
important
while
we
go
back
to
it
because
they
talk
about
the
prevention
of
bad
abominable
mixture
and
spurious
issue
and
we'll
see
that
language
time
and
again
throughout
all
the
judicial
decisions
referred
to
by
the
state.
and
then
they
went
into
two
centuries
of
trying
to
figure
out
who
these
people
were
that
they
were
proscribing.
i
won't
touch
upon
all
the
states.
i
understand
amicus
will
do
that.
but
at
one
time,
in
1705
it
was
a
person
with
one-eight
or
more
negro
blood
and
then
in
1785,
it
became
person
with
one
quarter
or
more
and
it
went
on
and
on.
it
wasn't
until
1930
that
we
finally
arrived
that
what
a
negro
is
in
the
state
of
virginia,
that's
a
person
with
any
traceable
negro
blood,
a
matter
which
we
think
defies
any
scientific
interpretation.
and
the
first
real
judicial
decision
we
get
in
virginia
was
in
1878
when
the
kinney
versus
commonwealth
case
came
down.
and
there
again,
we
have
a
very
interesting
decision
because
in
kinney
versus
commonwealth,
they
talk
about
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
virginia.
now
what
that
public
policy
was
and
how
would
it
be
applied?
if
your
honors
will
indulge
me,
i
have
the
language
here
which
is
the
language
that
had
carried
through,
through
the
history
of
virginia.
and
they
talk
about
spurious
issue
again,
and
that
is
what's
constantly
carried
through
and
carried
through
for
an
act
to
suppressing
of
outlawing
slaves.
and
they
talk
about
the
church
southern
civilization,
but
they
didn't
speak
about
the
southern
civilization
as
a
whole
but
this
white
southern
civilization.
and
they
want
the
race
as
kept
distinct
and
separate,
the
same
thing
this
court
has
heard
since
brown
and
before
brown,
but
it's
heard
so
many
times
during
the
brown
argument
and
since
the
brown
argument.
and
they
talk
about
alliances
so
unnatural
that
god
has
forbidden
them
and
this
language
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that's
kinney
versus
commonwealth,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
kinney,
k-i-n-n-e-y
and
then
in
1924,
in
the
period
of
great
history
in
the
united
states,
the
historical
period
we're
all
familiar
with,
a
period
when
the
west
was
in
arms
over
the
yellow
peril
and
western
states
were
thinking
about
these
laws
or
some
(inaudible),
a
period
when
the
immigration
laws
were
being
passed
to
the
united
states
because
the
north
was
worried
about
the
great
influx
of
italian
immigrants
and
irish
immigrants,
a
period
when
the
klan
rode
openly
in
the
south
and
that's
when
they
talked
about
bastardy
of
races,
and
miscegenation
and
amalgamation
and
race
suicide
became
the
watch
word,
and
john
powell,
a
man
we
singled
out
in
our
brief,
a
noted
pianist
of
his
day,
started
taking
up
the
darwin
theory
and
perverting
it
through
the
theory
of
eugenics,
the
theory
that
applied
to
animals,
to
pigs,
and
hogs,
and
cattle.
they
started
applying
it
to
human
beings.
in
taking
darwinism
that
the
negro
race
was
a
stepping
stone,
was
that
lost
men
we've
always
been
looking
for
between
the
white
man
and
the
abominable
snowman
whoever
else,
they
went
back.
and
that's
when
the
anglo-saxon
club
was
formed
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
that's
when
virginia
legislature
passed
our
present
body
of
law.
they
took
all
these
old
laws.
these
antebellum
and
postbellum
laws
and
they
put
them
together
into
what
we
presently
have.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
your
honor,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
basically
most
states
had
them.
it
was
just
virginia
and
then
georgia
copied
the
virginia
act
which
had
such
a
complete
act
and
it
was
described
in
many
places
as
the
most
perfect
model
with
this
type
of
act.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
most
--
no
your
honor,
most
of
them
actually
had
them
on
the
books.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
--
with
summary
codification,
this
one
virginia
strove
to
do
this
to
make
a
perfect
model
law
and
only
georgia
thought
it
was
expected
from
our
reading
of
history
that
many
other
states
would
follow
but
they
just
let
remain
what
they
had.
there
was
very
few
repeals
on
those
days.
actually,
the
great
body
of
repeal
has
been
since
brown
with
13
states
have
repealed
since
that
time.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
because
some
of
the
statutes
we
have
were
enacted
then,
all
the
registration
statutes
were
enacted
in
1924
your
honor.
these
are
the
statutes
basically
which
you
have
to
have
a
--
a
certificate
of
racial
composition
in
the
state
of
virginia.
the
statutes
which
we
find
absolutely
mostly
odious,
the
statutes
will
reflect
back
the
nazi
germany
and
to
the
present
south
african
situation.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
but
the
present
bill,
as
it
is
on
the
books
is
that
law
from
1924
and
it
was
entitled
"a
bill
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
white
race"
when
it
was
initially
issued.
it
was
passed
as
a
bill
for
racial
integrity
--
to
preserve
racial
integrity.
now,
we
would
advance
the
argument
very
strongly
to
the
court,
they're
not
concerned
with
racial
integrity
of
the
negro
race,
only
with
the
white
race.
in
fact
in
virginia,
it's
only
a
crime
for
white
and
negro
to
intermarry
and
the
lowest
couch
in
such
terms
that
they
say,
"white
may
only
marry
white"
in
section
20-54
of
our
law,
but
it
goes
on
from
there
to
make
it
a
crime
only
for
whites
and
negroes
to
intermarry.
there's
no
crime
for
malaysian
to
marry
a
negro
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
valid
marriage
in
virginia
but
it
would
be
a
void
marriage
for
malaysian
or
any
other
race
aside
from
negro
to
marry
a
white
person.
a
void
marriage
but
there'd
be
no
criminal
penalty
against
anyone
but
the
white
person.
they
were
not
concerned
with
the
racial
integrity
but
racial
supremacy
of
the
white
race.
in
1930,
they
finally,
as
i
said
before,
went
on,
say
any
person
with
traceable
negro
blood
with
a
negro.
now,
these
laws,
your
honors,
are
ludicrous
in
their
inception
and
equally
ludicrous
in
their
application.
it's
not
possible
to
look
at
just
the
virginia
laws
alone.
you
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
the
whole
south
we
feel
and
the
classifications
in
the
south.
it's
impossible
to
say.
i
won't
go
to
again,
the
exact
illustration
of
negroes
but
south
carolina,
north
carolina
make
certain
indians
white
people.
north
carolina,
cherokee
and
robeson
county
is
a
white
person,
all
of
the
cherokee
indians,
and
negroes.
in
south
carolina
is
the
kato
indians
and
these
laws
came
to
invent
to
these
other
very
hateful
laws.
in
mississippi
advocate
of
social
equality
under
the
mis
--
miscegenation
body
of
law.
it's
a
criminal
penalty.
i
think
it
carries
one
to
five
years.
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
several
decisions
handed
out
by
states
which
again
point
out
the
racial
feeling
concerning
these
laws.
the
missouri
laws
bottomed
on
states
versus
jackson
which
basically
held
that
if
the
progeny
of
a
mixed
marriage,
married
the
progeny
of
a
mixed
marriage,
there'd
be
no
further
progeny
and
fundamentally
ridiculous
statement.
maybe
it
wasn't
for
those
men
in
that
day
and
age
but
it
certainly
is
now
and
georgia
has
an
equally
ridiculous
basis
for
the
laws.
in
scott
versus
georgia
where
they
held
that
from
the
daily
observances,
they
see
that
the
offspring
of
such
marriages
are
feminine.
and
in
this
case,
and
i
will
refer
to
the
appellant's
brief
here
at
page
35,
the
loving
case
comes
to
you
based
on
the
case
of
name
versus
name.
now,
what
were
they
talking
about
in
name
versus
name?
again,
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
racial
integrity
of
their
citizens.
they
want
not
to
have
a
mongrel
breed
of
citizens.
we
find
there
no
requirement
that
the
state
shall
not
legislate
to
prevent
the
obliteration
of
racial
pride
but
must
permit
the
corruption
of
blood
even
though
it
weakens
or
destroy
the
quality
of
the
citizenship.
these
are
racial
and
equal
protection
thoroughly
proscribes
these.
in
the
case
before
you,
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
judge
bazile,
and
we
have
the
footnote
in
page
37
of
our
brief,
which
says,
"almighty
god
created
the
right
races,
white,
black,
yellow,
malay,
and
red
and
he
placed
them
on
separate
continents,"
and
i
didn't
read
the
whole
quote,
but
it's
a
fundamentally
ludicrous
quote
and
again,
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
we
feel
the
very
basic
wrong
of
these
statutes
is
they
rob
the
negro
race
of
their
dignity
and
fundamental
in
the
concept
of
liberty
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
dignity
of
the
individual,
because
without
that,
there
is
no
ordered
liberty.
we've
quoted
from
numerous
authorities
and
particularly
not
for
the
scientific
point
but
particularly,
i
refer
you
to
the
quotes
from
gunner
murdel
who's
made
a
noted
study
in
recent
years
of
this,
and
not
the
old
studies
that
are
otherwise
quoted.
your
honor
please,
there's
one
other
issue
that
the
state
raises
that
i
will
touch
on
briefly,
and
that's
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue.
to
begin
with
the
state
advances,
no
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
debates
themselves.
they
go
to
the
debates
of
the
1866
act
and
the
freedmen's
bureau
bills
which
did
immediately
precede
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
in
their
own
brief,
they
have
an
excellent
cite
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
impart
designed
to
provide
a
firm
constitutional
basis
for
the
civil
rights
act.
we
would
advance
that
the
in
part
is
the
answer
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
even
if
you
read
in
the
history,
the
1866
act,
it's
much
broader
in
scope.
its
language
is
much
broader
in
the
scope.
the
language
of
liberty,
due
process
is
much
broader
than
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
that
were
put
in
to
the
1866
legislative
act.
it
was
more
than
an
effort
to
put
these
laws
beyond
the
grasp
before
the
congress.
it
was
a
greater
protection.
and
your
honor
please,
even
if
you
want
to
take
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866,
we
feel
even
reading
that
language,
that
wasn't
clear.
it's
up
to
the
court
to
decide
what
happened.
many
legislators
felt
it
would
proscribe,
that
the
civil
rights
act
itself,
would
proscribe
this
type
of
laws
in
the
states.
even
various
proponents
said
amalgamation
laws
were
now
touched
and
basically
what
they
rely
on
in
their
brief,
and
in
their
argument
in
the
court
below,
and
i
might
point
out
to
your
honors
that
this
was
argued
fully
in
the
court
below
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
didn't
base
the
rule
on
the
argument,
but
push
to
the
side
and
went
to
the
merits
of
whether
these
laws
were
or
were
not
unconstitutional,
taking
into
account
before
taking
them.
as
i
recall,
this
was
put
before
this
court
in
the
mclaughlin
case,
well
i
know
it
was
and
it
was
put
before
the
lower
court
in
mclaughlin
cases,
the
same
argument.
now
while
mclaughlin
was
cohabitation,
i
think
you'd
have
to
read
those
laws
together
if
they
were
intended
to
be
reached
because
they
spoke
of
amalgamation
laws
in
the
arguments
of
the
1866
act.
but
even
if
you
would
read
the
language
of
senator
trumbull
which
they
rely
on
so
strongly,
what
did
he
really
say?
well,
one
point
page
17
in
their
brief,
he
says,
"i
presume
there
is
no
discrimination
in
this
respect"
and
he
goes
on
to
talk
about
his
argument,
the
law
as
i
understand
it
in
all
states
applies
equally.
this
was
the
pace
reasoning
which
this
court
has
set
aside,
but
the
real
tip
off
we
feel
on
this
comes
on
page
22
where
they're
quoting
trumbull
again.
and
he
says,
"this
bill
would
not
repeal
the
law
to
which
the
senator
refers,"
in
reply
to
senator
johnson,
"if
there
is
no
discrimination
made
by
it,
if
there
is
no
discrimination
made
by
it."
we
submit
very
strongly
as
it
had
been
before
the
court
many
times
that
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
an
open-ended
application
even
on
these
laws,
even
when
we
had
this
argument,
because
this
is
if
it's
not
discriminatory,
your
honors
must
reach
the
conclusion
whether
it's
discriminatory
or
not
and
it
is
clearly
discriminatory.
we
speak
of
this
on
page
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
quoting
bickel,
a
noted
constitutional
authority.
he
said,
"they
were
open-ended
and
meant
to
be
expanded
in
light
of
changing
times
and
circumstances"
and
quoting
this
court
from
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority,
"its
constitutional
assurance
was
reserved
in
terms
of
imprecision
was
necessary
if
the
right
were
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
variety
of
individual
state
relations."
there
are
any
number
of
such
quotes
in
your
opinions
in
the
last
ten
years.
the
same
argument
you
had
before
you
all
the
time
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
your
honors
very
adequately
answered
that
argument
in
the
mclaughlin
decision
when
you
said,
"this
was
essential
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment"
and
we
submit
very
strongly,
it
is
the
essential
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
your
honors
please
in
resting
on
the
equal
protection
argument,
we
fail
to
see
how
any
reasonable
man
can
but
conclude
that
these
laws
are
slavery
laws
were
incepted
to
keep
the
slaves
in
their
place,
were
prolonged
to
keep
the
slaves
in
their
place,
and
in
truth,
the
virginia
law
still
views
the
negro
race
as
a
slave
race,
that
these
are
the
most
odious
laws
to
come
before
the
court.
they
robbed
the
negro
race
of
its
dignity
and
only
a
decision
which
will
reach
the
full
body
of
these
laws
in
the
state
of
virginia
will
change
that.
we
ask
that
the
court
consider
the
full
spectrum
of
these
laws
and
not
just
the
criminality,
because
it's
more
than
a
criminality
that's
at
point
here,
that
the
legitimacy
of
children
right
to
inherent
land,
the
many,
many
rights,
and
in
reaching
a
decision,
we
ask
you
reach
on
that
basis.
thank
you
your
honors.
