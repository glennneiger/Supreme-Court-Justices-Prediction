mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
bernard
s.
cohen.
i
would
like
to
move
the
admission
of
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
pro
hac
vice,
my
co-counsel
in
this
matter.
he's
a
member
of
the
bar
of
virginia.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
here
merely
to
obtain
a
reversal
on
behalf
of
richard
perry
loving
and
mildred
jeter
loving.
i
think
mr.
hirschkop
would
have
presented
a
cogent
and
complete
argument
based
upon
the
equal
protection
clause
which
would
leave
no
course
but
to
find
the
statutes
question
unconstitutional.
however,
while
there
is
no
doubt
in
our
minds
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
and
have
run
afoul
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
urge
with
equal
strength
that
the
statutes
also
run
afoul
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
whether
one
articulates
in
terms
of
the
right
to
be
free
from
racial
discrimination
as
being
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
one
talks
of
the
right
to
be
free
from
infringement
of
basic
values
implicit
in
ordered
liberty
as
justice
harlan
has
said
in
the
griswold
case,
citing
palko
versus
connecticut
or
if
we
talk
about
the
right
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
and
capricious
denials
of
fourteenth
amendment
liberty
as
mr.
justice
white
has
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
griswold
or
if
we
urge
upon
this
court
to
say
as
it
has
said
before
in
myer
versus
nebraska
and
skinner
versus
oklahoma
that
marriage
is
a
fundamental
right
or
liberty
and
whether
we
go
further
and
urge
that
the
court
say
that
this
is
a
fundamental
right
of
liberty
retained
by
the
people
within
the
meaning
of
the
ninth
amendment
and
within
the
meaning
of
liberty
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
we
have
conceded
that
the
state
may
properly
regulate
marriages
and
may
regulate
divorces
and
indeed
they
have
done
so
and
this
court
has
upheld
certain
regulations.
i
don't
know
whether
the
issue
of
consanguinity
or
affinity
has
ever
been
here
but
certainly
the
one
that
comes
to
my
mind
first
would
be
the
reynolds
case
in
the
polygamy
matter
and
that
we
have
no
trouble
distinguishing
those,
and
i
--
i
don't
think
the
court
will
either.
there
was
no
race
question
involved.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
well,
i
--
i
have
stated
that
the
due
process
clause
has
been
subject
to
many
articulations.
and
what
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
was
that
all
of
these
articulations
can
find
some
application
in
this
particular
case.
if
you
ask
me
for
the
strength
of
the
argument
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
as
applied
to
this
case,
i
urge
most
strongly
that
it
be
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
amendment
to
protect
against
racial
discrimination.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
the
other
arguments
are
completely
invalid.
i
--
i
don't
even
know
if
the
court
ever
has
to
reach
them,
but
one
can
still
argue
that
there
is
liberty
and
a
right
to
marry
as
this
court
has
said
in
myer
and
skinner
and
that
in
no
way,
detracts
from
our
argument
that
they
cannot
--
the
state
cannot
infringe
upon
the
right
of
richard
and
mildred
loving
to
marry
because
of
race.
these
are
--
these
are
just
not
acceptable
grounds.
we
are
talking
about
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
ground
and
we
--
we
should
have
no
trouble.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
i
believe
that
we
run
into
another
step
before
we
can
reach
that
your
honor
and
that
is
the
burden
of
coming
forth
with
the
evidence.
i
think
that
a
state
can
legislate
and
can
restrict
marriage
and
might
even
be
able
to
go
so
far
as
to
restrict
marriage
between
first
cousins
as
some
states
have.
and
i
think
that
if
that
case
were
before
the
court,
they
would
not
have
the
advantage
that
we
have
of
a
presumption
being
shifted
and
a
burden
being
shifted
to
the
state
to
show
that
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
proscribing
inter-racial
marriages.
however,
if
we
were
here
on
a
first
cousins
case,
i
think
we
would
have
the
tougher
road
to
hoe
because
we
would
have
to
come
in
and
show
that
the
proscription
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
was
not
based
upon
some
reasonable
grounds,
and
that
is
a
difficult
thing
for
an
appellant
to
do.
thankfully,
we
are
not
here
with
that
burden.
the
state
is
and
we
submit
that
the
state
cannot
overcome
that
burden.
not
only
do
we
submit
that
they
cannot
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
certainly
submit
they
have
not.
nowhere
in
the
state's
brief,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
virginia's
antimiscegenation
statutes,
is
there
anything
clearer
than
would
--
mr.
hirschkop
has
already
elucidated
that
these
are
racial
statutes
to
perpetuate
the
badges
and
bonds
of
slavery.
that
is
not
a
permissible
state
action.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
your
honor,
there
have
not
been
any
efforts
and
i
can
tell
you
from
a
personal
experience
that
candidates
who
run
for
office
for
the
state
legislature
have
told
me
that
they
would,
under
no
circumstances,
sacrifice
their
political
lives
by
attempting
to
introduce
such
a
bill.
there
is
one
candidate
who
has
indicated
that
he
would
probably
do
so
at
some
time
in
the
future,
but
most
of
them
have
indicated
that
it
would
be
political
suicide
in
virginia.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
your
honor,
we
should
be
very
pleased
to
have
a
decision
from
this
court
that
all
of
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional
based
upon
the
equal
protection
clause.
however,
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
that
the
court,
if
it
uses
the
equal
protection
argument
to
find
the
statute
unconstitutional
that
there
might
be
some
way
that
virginia
could
possibly
get
around
this
by
reenacting
a
statute
that
was
--
that
would
absolutely,
only
permit
whites
to
marry
whites,
negroes
to
marry
negroes,
malaysians
to
marry
malaysians,
and
possibly
might
--
we
might
be
back
here
again.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
well,
i
--
i
quite
agree
your
honor
and
i
--
i
do
think
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
--
is
the
strongest
argument,
that
is
the
correct
argument
and
it
is
the
basis
upon
which
we
strongly
urge
the
court
to
rule.
we
are
mostly
concerned
about
a
narrow
ruling
that
would
not
go
to
the
whole
section
of
statutes.
there
are
10
sections,
section
20-50
through
20-60
and
this
is
our
chief
concern
that
the
court
might
not
touch
the
racial
composition
certificate
statute.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
the
racial
composition
certificate,
section
20-50
says
that
anybody
in
virginia
who
applies
to
the
state
registrar
vital
statistics
shall
be
given
a
certificate
of
racial
composition.
he
goes
and
he
says
--
he
goes
up
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
says,
"i'm
white.
i
want
a
certificate
of
racial
composition
or
i'm
white
or
negro.
i
want
a
certificate
of
racial
composition
that
i'm
negro."
and
if
the
clerk
looks
at
him
and
believes
him,
he
him
fill
out
something
and
certifies
that
to
the
way
it
looks
to
him
this
person
is
white,
or
is
negro,
and
he
sends
down
to
richmond
and
he
gets
a
certificate
of
racial
composition.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
has
not
been
used
in
recent
years
and
i
don't
know
what
is
its
extent
was.
back
around
1924,
except
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
brought
in
the
state
registrar
of
vital
statistics
and
he
testified
that
there
was
great
confusion
under
the
old
law
as
to
who
is
a
member
of
which
race
and
that
they
were
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
determining
who
is
a
member
of
which
race
and
who
could
be
proscribed
from
marrying
whom
and
called
for
this
very
strict
statute
which
now
says
that
white
persons
may
only
marry
white
persons.
therefore,
what
they've
done
is
make
it
a
crime
for
a
white
person
to
marry
a
negro
or
a
negro
person
to
marry
a
white
person,
but
it's
not
a
crime
for
a
negro
to
marry
a
malaysian.
it's
a
void
marriage
in
virginia
and
they
may
be
prosecuted
for
violation
of
the
fornication
statutes
but
not
for
violation
of
the
--
of
the
antimiscegenation
statute.
the
section
20-54
merely
makes
civil
disability
apparent
in
a
white
--
in
a
marriage
between
a
--
a
white
and
a
malaysian
or
a
negro
and
a
--
a
--
well,
we're
not
exactly
sure
about
that
but
between
a
white
and
anybody
else,
but
another
white
or
a
negro,
it
is
not
a
criminal
act
and
therefore,
they
are
under
great
civil
disability.
they
--
the
children
are
illegitimate.
the
white
cannot
--
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
absolutely
not.
that
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
yes,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
i
believe
it
would.
the
enormity
of
the
injustices
involved
under
this
statute
is
--
merely
serves
us
indicia
of
how
the
civil
liabilities
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process
to
the
individuals
involved.
as
i
started
to
say
before,
no
matter
how
we
articulate
this,
no
matter
which
theory
of
the
due
process
clause
or
which
emphasis
we
attach
to,
no
one
can
articulate
it
better
than
richard
loving
when
he
said
to
me,
"mr.
cohen,
tell
the
court
i
love
my
wife
and
it
is
just
unfair
that
i
can't
live
with
her
in
virginia."
i
think
this
very
simple
layman
has
a
concept
of
fundamental
fairness
and
ordered
liberty
that
he
can
articulate
as
a
brick
layer
that
we
hope
this
court
has
set
out
time
and
time
again
in
its
decisions
on
the
due
process
clause.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
urged
by
the
state
as
being
conclusive
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
mean
to
make
unconstitutional
state
statutes
prohibiting
miscegenation.
we
want
to
emphasize
three
important
points.
one,
only
a
small
group
of
senators
in
any
of
the
debates
cited
ever
expressed
themselves
at
all
with
respect
to
the
miscegenation
statutes.
there
are
perhaps
five
or
six
that
are
even
quoted
and
these
were
for
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
in
the
act
--
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
if
absence
of
debate
ever
has
any
influence
at
all,
this
is
a
classic
case.
nowhere
has
the
state
been
able
to
cite
one
item
of
legislative
debate
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
with
respect
to
antimiscegenation
statutes,
not
one
item.
all
of
their
references
are
to
the
1866
act.
and
again,
we
point
out
that
those
comments
were
very
carefully
worded
by
both
proponents
and
opponents
of
the
bill.
again,
we
carefully
point
out
that
their
own
record
of
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
were
just
as
many
senators
who
believed
that
indeed,
especially
the
southern
senators
who
states
had
antimiscegenation
statutes,
they
were
just
as
many
of
them
who
did
believe
that
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
would
invalidate
such
an
act.
their
own
passages
that
they
printed
in
the
brief
around
pages
30
through
33
are
replete
with
support
for
our
argument
that
--
that
the
--
at
best,
at
best,
the
legislative
history
is
inconclusive.
and
as
this
court
has
found
before
and
we
hope
will
continue
to
find,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
an
amendment
which
grows
and
can
be
applied
to
situations
as
our
knowledge
becomes
greater
and
as
our
progress
is
made
and
that
there
will
be
no
problem
in
finding
that
this
set
of
statutes
in
virginia
are
erroneous
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
have
been
questioned
about
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
marriage
and
i
think
that
where
the
court
has
found
that
the
state
could
in
fact
regulate
marriage
within
permissible
grounds,
they've
gone
on
as
they
did
in
the
reynolds
case
to
find
that
the
people
that
there
was
a
danger
to
the
principles
on
which
the
government
of
the
people
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
rests.
i
ask
this
court
if
the
state
is
urging
here
that
there
is
some
state
principle
involved
or
some
principle
of
the
people
involved
that
is
a
proper
principle
of
theirs,
what
is
it?
what
is
the
danger
to
the
state
of
virginia
of
interracial
marriage?
what
is
the
state
of
the
danger
to
the
people
of
interracial
marriage?
this
question
has
been
carefully
avoided.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
probably
in
my
understanding
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has
made
a
strong
argument
in
favor
of
the
court
limiting
its
decision
to
sections
20-58
and
20-59
but
has
very,
very
carefully
avoided
the
fact
that
20-58
which
--
which
is
classified
as
evasion
statute
is
much
more
than
that.
20-58
cannot
exist
without
20-54
because
it
refers
to
a
white
person
and
there
is
nowhere
else
the
virginia
code
that
a
white
person
is
defined
other
than
in
section
20-54
which
is
the
general
ban
on
interracial
marriages.
so,
if
he
says
that
20-58
and
20-59
are
before
this
court,
it
is
absolutely
--
absolutely
necessary
that
20-54
also
be
considered
because
58
and
59
could
not
stand
without
the
definition
in
54.
in
addition,
the
definition
of
colored
person
appears
in
section
1-14
of
virginia
code
and
so
it
is
here
involved.
these
are
the
very
minimum
number
of
sections
which
can
possibly
be
involved,
but
we
go
further.
when
the
racial
integrity
act
of
1924
was
passed,
it
was
passed
as
a
single
act
with
10
sections.
it
is
true
and
we
do
not
argue
with
the
state
that
20-58
and
59
were
sections
which
had
pre-existed
the
racial
integrity
act
of
1924
and
we're
just
added
on
with
other
sections,
but
it
was
part
and
parcel
one
act
and
today,
the
mere
fact
that
it's
codified
with
virginia
code
with
different
numbers
does
not
the
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
was
passed
as
one
legislative
act
on
one
day
with
the
same
vote
before
the
virginia
legislature.
they
are
inseparable.
the
state
has
urged
that
the
legislative
history
is
conclusive
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
nobody
has
stated
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
expand
the
meaning
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
over
and
above
what
was
meant
to
be
included
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
in
our
brief
at
page
30,
we
take
issue
with
this
and
again
at
page
32,
citing
bickel,
the
original
understanding
of
desegregation
decision
and
we
go
on
to
say
referring
to
the
bickel
work
that
a
correct
appraisal
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
broad
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
purposes
of
constitutional
adjudication
is
that
they
were
open
ended
and
meant
to
be
expounded
in
light
of
changing
times
in
circumstances.
on
page
32,
we
indicate
that
the
bickel
article
has
concluded
that
the
principle
of
the
brown
case
should
control
the
constitutionality
of
the
miscegenation
laws.
this
is
in
the
bickel
article,
the
least
dangerous
branch
at
page
71
published
in
1962.
this
is
a
definitive
work
and
this
is
a
study
of
the
legislative
history,
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
has
reached
the
very
conclusion
that
the
state
would
have
us
believe
and
nobody
can
reach.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
oh
yes,
your
honor.
another
point
of
statutory
construction
though
your
honor
which
i
think
is
very
significant.
if
the
framers
had
the
intent
to
exclude
antimiscegenation
statutes,
it
would
have
been
taken
but
a
single
phrase
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
say
excluding
antimiscegenation
statues.
the
language
was
broad,
the
language
was
sweeping,
the
language
meant
to
include
equal
protection
for
negroes
that
was
at
the
very
heart
of
it
and
that
equal
protection
included
the
right
to
marry
as
any
other
human
being
had
the
right
to
marry
subject
to
only
the
same
limitations.
the
state
has
said
that
the
amount
of
persons
other
than
negroes
and
whites
involved
is
very
insignificant
and
very
small.
well,
this
is
the
first
negro-white
miscegenation
case
in
virginia
to
come
to
the
supreme
court.
it
is
the
first
negro-white
miscegenation
case
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
there
have
been
a
handful
of
others,
every
single
one
of
them
involving
a
person
of
what
might
be
called
yellow
extraction
or
malaysian
or
filipino
and
white
persons.
so
to
say
that
the
problem
itself
is
insignificant
in
virginia
is
not
at
all
true
which
reflected
in
the
actual
case
law
in
virginia,
the
case
of
calma
versus
calma,
involved
a
filipino,
the
case
of
name
versus
name
involved
a
possible
oriental
whose
background
was
not
exactly
clear
from
the
record.
now,
the
state
is
ignoring
a
very
important
point
which
we
cannot
overemphasize
if
this
decision
only
goes
to
sections
58
and
59
of
the
statute
and
that
is
the
right
of
richard
and
mildred
loving
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
or
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
knowing
that
the
sheriff
will
not
be
knocking
on
their
door
or
shining
a
light
in
their
face
in
the
privacy
of
their
bedroom
for
illicit
cohabitation.
if
58
and
59
are
found
unconstitutional
and
54
is
allowed
to
remain
on
the
books
that
is
precisely
what
can
happen.
it
will
be
an
exact
repetition
of
what
in
fact
did
happen
to
them
and
this
court
will
not
be
given
the
lovings
the
relief
they
require.
the
lovings
have
the
right
to
go
to
sleep
at
night,
knowing
that
should
not
--
should
they
not
awake
in
the
morning,
their
children
would
have
the
right
to
inherent
from
them
under
intestacy.
they
have
the
right
to
be
secure
and
knowing
that
if
they
go
to
sleep
and
do
not
wake
in
the
morning
that
one
of
them
or
survivor
of
them
has
the
right
to
social
security
benefits.
all
of
these
are
denied
to
them
and
they
will
not
be
denied
to
them
if
the
whole
miscegenous
--
antimiscegenation
scheme
of
virginia
sections
20
through
50
--
through
20-60
are
found
unconstitutional.
while,
i
do
not
place
great
emphasis
on
the
work
of
rabbi
gordon,
i
feel
compelled
to
note
that
in
the
state's
quotes
from
rabbi
gordon,
there
is
conspicuous
absence
of
the
following
quotation
on
appendix
page
4
which
would
fit
uniquely
in
the
ellipsis
shown
there.
rabbi
gordon
states
and
it
is
not
printed
in
the
state's
brief,
our
democracy
would
soon
be
defeated
if
any
group
on
the
american
scene
was
required
to
cut
itself
off
from
context
with
persons
of
other
religions
or
races.
the
segregation
of
any
group
religious
or
racial
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
is
unthinkable
and
even
dangerous
to
the
body
politic.
now,
virginia
stands
here
today
and
in
this
loving
case
for
the
first
time
tries
to
find
a
justification
other
than
white
racial
supremacy
for
the
existence
of
its
statute.
mr.
mcilwaine
is
quite
candid
that
this
is
a
current
day
justification
not
the
justification
of
the
framers.
on
the
one
hand,
i
see
a
little
dilemma
here.
he
asks
that
the
court
look
to
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
to
ignore
the
framers
of
the
1924
act
to
preserve
racial
integrity
in
virginia.
it
is
not
a
dilemma
i
would
like
to
be
in.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
well,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
statement
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
no,
but
i
--
no,
i
don't
feel
that
dilemma
at
all
your
honor.
we
do
not
for
a
moment
concede
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
clear
or
conclusive
that
they
meant
to
exclude
miscegenetic
marriages
while
mr.
mcilwaine
has
stood
here
and
i
believe
conceded
that
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
1924
act
of
--
of
racial
integrity
was
a
white
supremacy
act.
so
i
don't
feel
it
at
all
uncomfortable
in
that
situation.
now,
on
the
one
hand,
the
state
urges
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
prohibit
or
to
--
for
the
statute
to
go
against
smaller
minority
groups
that
exist
in
virginia.
and
i
say
that
why
have
they
taken
the
trouble
in
section
54
to
prohibit
marriages
between
whites
and
malaysians
or
white
and
anybody
else.
the
fact
of
the
manner
is
that
it
is
important
to
the
statutory
scheme
of
virginia
to
discriminate
against
anybody
but
white
people.
now,
while
there
is
no
definitive
case
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
new
york
couple
involved
in
a
miscegenetic
marriage
moving
to
virginia
will
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony
and
i
admit
it
might
be
open
to
some
judicial
interpretation.
i
feel
strongly
and
i
think
the
court
can
reach
this
decision
and
--
and
i
think
some
authorities
writing
in
law
journals
have
reached
the
decision
that
under
section
20-59,
referring
to
any
white
person,
intermarrying
with
a
colored
person,
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony
and
shall
be
punished
by
confinement
of
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
one
or
more
than
five
years.
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
doubt
appearing
in
a
very
same
racial
integrity
act
of
1924.
five
sections
after
the
act
which
says
it
shall
hereafter
the
unlawful
for
any
white
person
in
the
state
to
marry
any
save
a
white
person.
i
don't
see
how
it
is
possible
to
conclude
that
even
a
new
york
couple
would
not
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony
in
virginia.
in
any
event,
the
state
is
conceded
that
they
certainly
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime
that
of
illicit
cohabitation
and
has
left
be
rest
open.
we
argue
that
certainly
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
some
prosecutors
at
the
lower
trial
level
some
places
in
virginia
that
would
have
no
compunction
whatsoever
in
going
ahead
and
prosecuting
under
59
as
a
felony
couples
moving
into
the
state
involved
in
miscegenetic
marriage.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
not
to
our
knowledge
and
to
our
research,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
i
believe
some
of
the
northern
states
did,
your
honor.
i
think
the
state's
position
and
the
appellant's
position
come
together
and
agree
at
only
one
point
but
the
court
should
not
go
into
the
morass
of
sociological
evidence
that
is
available
on
both
sides
of
the
question.
we
strongly
urge
that
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
our
position
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
specifically
related
to
it
being
an
anti-racial
amendment,
give
this
court
sufficient
breadth
and
sufficient
depth
to
invalidate
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
bernard
s.
cohen.
i
would
like
to
move
the
admission
of
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
pro
hac
vice,
my
co-counsel
in
this
matter.
he's
a
member
of
the
bar
of
virginia.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
here
merely
to
obtain
a
reversal
on
behalf
of
richard
perry
loving
and
mildred
jeter
loving.
i
think
mr.
hirschkop
would
have
presented
a
cogent
and
complete
argument
based
upon
the
equal
protection
clause
which
would
leave
no
course
but
to
find
the
statutes
question
unconstitutional.
however,
while
there
is
no
doubt
in
our
minds
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
and
have
run
afoul
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
urge
with
equal
strength
that
the
statutes
also
run
afoul
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
whether
one
articulates
in
terms
of
the
right
to
be
free
from
racial
discrimination
as
being
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
one
talks
of
the
right
to
be
free
from
infringement
of
basic
values
implicit
in
ordered
liberty
as
justice
harlan
has
said
in
the
griswold
case,
citing
palko
versus
connecticut
or
if
we
talk
about
the
right
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
and
capricious
denials
of
fourteenth
amendment
liberty
as
mr.
justice
white
has
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
griswold
or
if
we
urge
upon
this
court
to
say
as
it
has
said
before
in
myer
versus
nebraska
and
skinner
versus
oklahoma
that
marriage
is
a
fundamental
right
or
liberty
and
whether
we
go
further
and
urge
that
the
court
say
that
this
is
a
fundamental
right
of
liberty
retained
by
the
people
within
the
meaning
of
the
ninth
amendment
and
within
the
meaning
of
liberty
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
we
have
conceded
that
the
state
may
properly
regulate
marriages
and
may
regulate
divorces
and
indeed
they
have
done
so
and
this
court
has
upheld
certain
regulations.
i
don't
know
whether
the
issue
of
consanguinity
or
affinity
has
ever
been
here
but
certainly
the
one
that
comes
to
my
mind
first
would
be
the
reynolds
case
in
the
polygamy
matter
and
that
we
have
no
trouble
distinguishing
those,
and
i
--
i
don't
think
the
court
will
either.
there
was
no
race
question
involved.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
well,
i
--
i
have
stated
that
the
due
process
clause
has
been
subject
to
many
articulations.
and
what
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
was
that
all
of
these
articulations
can
find
some
application
in
this
particular
case.
if
you
ask
me
for
the
strength
of
the
argument
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
as
applied
to
this
case,
i
urge
most
strongly
that
it
be
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
amendment
to
protect
against
racial
discrimination.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
the
other
arguments
are
completely
invalid.
i
--
i
don't
even
know
if
the
court
ever
has
to
reach
them,
but
one
can
still
argue
that
there
is
liberty
and
a
right
to
marry
as
this
court
has
said
in
myer
and
skinner
and
that
in
no
way,
detracts
from
our
argument
that
they
cannot
--
the
state
cannot
infringe
upon
the
right
of
richard
and
mildred
loving
to
marry
because
of
race.
these
are
--
these
are
just
not
acceptable
grounds.
we
are
talking
about
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
ground
and
we
--
we
should
have
no
trouble.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
i
believe
that
we
run
into
another
step
before
we
can
reach
that
your
honor
and
that
is
the
burden
of
coming
forth
with
the
evidence.
i
think
that
a
state
can
legislate
and
can
restrict
marriage
and
might
even
be
able
to
go
so
far
as
to
restrict
marriage
between
first
cousins
as
some
states
have.
and
i
think
that
if
that
case
were
before
the
court,
they
would
not
have
the
advantage
that
we
have
of
a
presumption
being
shifted
and
a
burden
being
shifted
to
the
state
to
show
that
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
proscribing
inter-racial
marriages.
however,
if
we
were
here
on
a
first
cousins
case,
i
think
we
would
have
the
tougher
road
to
hoe
because
we
would
have
to
come
in
and
show
that
the
proscription
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
was
not
based
upon
some
reasonable
grounds,
and
that
is
a
difficult
thing
for
an
appellant
to
do.
thankfully,
we
are
not
here
with
that
burden.
the
state
is
and
we
submit
that
the
state
cannot
overcome
that
burden.
not
only
do
we
submit
that
they
cannot
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
certainly
submit
they
have
not.
nowhere
in
the
state's
brief,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
virginia's
antimiscegenation
statutes,
is
there
anything
clearer
than
would
--
mr.
hirschkop
has
already
elucidated
that
these
are
racial
statutes
to
perpetuate
the
badges
and
bonds
of
slavery.
that
is
not
a
permissible
state
action.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
your
honor,
there
have
not
been
any
efforts
and
i
can
tell
you
from
a
personal
experience
that
candidates
who
run
for
office
for
the
state
legislature
have
told
me
that
they
would,
under
no
circumstances,
sacrifice
their
political
lives
by
attempting
to
introduce
such
a
bill.
there
is
one
candidate
who
has
indicated
that
he
would
probably
do
so
at
some
time
in
the
future,
but
most
of
them
have
indicated
that
it
would
be
political
suicide
in
virginia.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
your
honor,
we
should
be
very
pleased
to
have
a
decision
from
this
court
that
all
of
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional
based
upon
the
equal
protection
clause.
however,
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
that
the
court,
if
it
uses
the
equal
protection
argument
to
find
the
statute
unconstitutional
that
there
might
be
some
way
that
virginia
could
possibly
get
around
this
by
reenacting
a
statute
that
was
--
that
would
absolutely,
only
permit
whites
to
marry
whites,
negroes
to
marry
negroes,
malaysians
to
marry
malaysians,
and
possibly
might
--
we
might
be
back
here
again.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
well,
i
--
i
quite
agree
your
honor
and
i
--
i
do
think
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
--
is
the
strongest
argument,
that
is
the
correct
argument
and
it
is
the
basis
upon
which
we
strongly
urge
the
court
to
rule.
we
are
mostly
concerned
about
a
narrow
ruling
that
would
not
go
to
the
whole
section
of
statutes.
there
are
10
sections,
section
20-50
through
20-60
and
this
is
our
chief
concern
that
the
court
might
not
touch
the
racial
composition
certificate
statute.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
the
racial
composition
certificate,
section
20-50
says
that
anybody
in
virginia
who
applies
to
the
state
registrar
vital
statistics
shall
be
given
a
certificate
of
racial
composition.
he
goes
and
he
says
--
he
goes
up
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
says,
"i'm
white.
i
want
a
certificate
of
racial
composition
or
i'm
white
or
negro.
i
want
a
certificate
of
racial
composition
that
i'm
negro."
and
if
the
clerk
looks
at
him
and
believes
him,
he
him
fill
out
something
and
certifies
that
to
the
way
it
looks
to
him
this
person
is
white,
or
is
negro,
and
he
sends
down
to
richmond
and
he
gets
a
certificate
of
racial
composition.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
has
not
been
used
in
recent
years
and
i
don't
know
what
is
its
extent
was.
back
around
1924,
except
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
brought
in
the
state
registrar
of
vital
statistics
and
he
testified
that
there
was
great
confusion
under
the
old
law
as
to
who
is
a
member
of
which
race
and
that
they
were
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
determining
who
is
a
member
of
which
race
and
who
could
be
proscribed
from
marrying
whom
and
called
for
this
very
strict
statute
which
now
says
that
white
persons
may
only
marry
white
persons.
therefore,
what
they've
done
is
make
it
a
crime
for
a
white
person
to
marry
a
negro
or
a
negro
person
to
marry
a
white
person,
but
it's
not
a
crime
for
a
negro
to
marry
a
malaysian.
it's
a
void
marriage
in
virginia
and
they
may
be
prosecuted
for
violation
of
the
fornication
statutes
but
not
for
violation
of
the
--
of
the
antimiscegenation
statute.
the
section
20-54
merely
makes
civil
disability
apparent
in
a
white
--
in
a
marriage
between
a
--
a
white
and
a
malaysian
or
a
negro
and
a
--
a
--
well,
we're
not
exactly
sure
about
that
but
between
a
white
and
anybody
else,
but
another
white
or
a
negro,
it
is
not
a
criminal
act
and
therefore,
they
are
under
great
civil
disability.
they
--
the
children
are
illegitimate.
the
white
cannot
--
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
absolutely
not.
that
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
yes,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
i
believe
it
would.
the
enormity
of
the
injustices
involved
under
this
statute
is
--
merely
serves
us
indicia
of
how
the
civil
liabilities
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process
to
the
individuals
involved.
as
i
started
to
say
before,
no
matter
how
we
articulate
this,
no
matter
which
theory
of
the
due
process
clause
or
which
emphasis
we
attach
to,
no
one
can
articulate
it
better
than
richard
loving
when
he
said
to
me,
"mr.
cohen,
tell
the
court
i
love
my
wife
and
it
is
just
unfair
that
i
can't
live
with
her
in
virginia."
i
think
this
very
simple
layman
has
a
concept
of
fundamental
fairness
and
ordered
liberty
that
he
can
articulate
as
a
brick
layer
that
we
hope
this
court
has
set
out
time
and
time
again
in
its
decisions
on
the
due
process
clause.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
urged
by
the
state
as
being
conclusive
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
mean
to
make
unconstitutional
state
statutes
prohibiting
miscegenation.
we
want
to
emphasize
three
important
points.
one,
only
a
small
group
of
senators
in
any
of
the
debates
cited
ever
expressed
themselves
at
all
with
respect
to
the
miscegenation
statutes.
there
are
perhaps
five
or
six
that
are
even
quoted
and
these
were
for
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
in
the
act
--
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
if
absence
of
debate
ever
has
any
influence
at
all,
this
is
a
classic
case.
nowhere
has
the
state
been
able
to
cite
one
item
of
legislative
debate
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
with
respect
to
antimiscegenation
statutes,
not
one
item.
all
of
their
references
are
to
the
1866
act.
and
again,
we
point
out
that
those
comments
were
very
carefully
worded
by
both
proponents
and
opponents
of
the
bill.
again,
we
carefully
point
out
that
their
own
record
of
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
were
just
as
many
senators
who
believed
that
indeed,
especially
the
southern
senators
who
states
had
antimiscegenation
statutes,
they
were
just
as
many
of
them
who
did
believe
that
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
would
invalidate
such
an
act.
their
own
passages
that
they
printed
in
the
brief
around
pages
30
through
33
are
replete
with
support
for
our
argument
that
--
that
the
--
at
best,
at
best,
the
legislative
history
is
inconclusive.
and
as
this
court
has
found
before
and
we
hope
will
continue
to
find,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
an
amendment
which
grows
and
can
be
applied
to
situations
as
our
knowledge
becomes
greater
and
as
our
progress
is
made
and
that
there
will
be
no
problem
in
finding
that
this
set
of
statutes
in
virginia
are
erroneous
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
have
been
questioned
about
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
marriage
and
i
think
that
where
the
court
has
found
that
the
state
could
in
fact
regulate
marriage
within
permissible
grounds,
they've
gone
on
as
they
did
in
the
reynolds
case
to
find
that
the
people
that
there
was
a
danger
to
the
principles
on
which
the
government
of
the
people
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
rests.
i
ask
this
court
if
the
state
is
urging
here
that
there
is
some
state
principle
involved
or
some
principle
of
the
people
involved
that
is
a
proper
principle
of
theirs,
what
is
it?
what
is
the
danger
to
the
state
of
virginia
of
interracial
marriage?
what
is
the
state
of
the
danger
to
the
people
of
interracial
marriage?
this
question
has
been
carefully
avoided.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
probably
in
my
understanding
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has
made
a
strong
argument
in
favor
of
the
court
limiting
its
decision
to
sections
20-58
and
20-59
but
has
very,
very
carefully
avoided
the
fact
that
20-58
which
--
which
is
classified
as
evasion
statute
is
much
more
than
that.
20-58
cannot
exist
without
20-54
because
it
refers
to
a
white
person
and
there
is
nowhere
else
the
virginia
code
that
a
white
person
is
defined
other
than
in
section
20-54
which
is
the
general
ban
on
interracial
marriages.
so,
if
he
says
that
20-58
and
20-59
are
before
this
court,
it
is
absolutely
--
absolutely
necessary
that
20-54
also
be
considered
because
58
and
59
could
not
stand
without
the
definition
in
54.
in
addition,
the
definition
of
colored
person
appears
in
section
1-14
of
virginia
code
and
so
it
is
here
involved.
these
are
the
very
minimum
number
of
sections
which
can
possibly
be
involved,
but
we
go
further.
when
the
racial
integrity
act
of
1924
was
passed,
it
was
passed
as
a
single
act
with
10
sections.
it
is
true
and
we
do
not
argue
with
the
state
that
20-58
and
59
were
sections
which
had
pre-existed
the
racial
integrity
act
of
1924
and
we're
just
added
on
with
other
sections,
but
it
was
part
and
parcel
one
act
and
today,
the
mere
fact
that
it's
codified
with
virginia
code
with
different
numbers
does
not
the
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
was
passed
as
one
legislative
act
on
one
day
with
the
same
vote
before
the
virginia
legislature.
they
are
inseparable.
the
state
has
urged
that
the
legislative
history
is
conclusive
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
nobody
has
stated
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
expand
the
meaning
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
over
and
above
what
was
meant
to
be
included
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
in
our
brief
at
page
30,
we
take
issue
with
this
and
again
at
page
32,
citing
bickel,
the
original
understanding
of
desegregation
decision
and
we
go
on
to
say
referring
to
the
bickel
work
that
a
correct
appraisal
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
broad
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
purposes
of
constitutional
adjudication
is
that
they
were
open
ended
and
meant
to
be
expounded
in
light
of
changing
times
in
circumstances.
on
page
32,
we
indicate
that
the
bickel
article
has
concluded
that
the
principle
of
the
brown
case
should
control
the
constitutionality
of
the
miscegenation
laws.
this
is
in
the
bickel
article,
the
least
dangerous
branch
at
page
71
published
in
1962.
this
is
a
definitive
work
and
this
is
a
study
of
the
legislative
history,
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
has
reached
the
very
conclusion
that
the
state
would
have
us
believe
and
nobody
can
reach.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
oh
yes,
your
honor.
another
point
of
statutory
construction
though
your
honor
which
i
think
is
very
significant.
if
the
framers
had
the
intent
to
exclude
antimiscegenation
statutes,
it
would
have
been
taken
but
a
single
phrase
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
say
excluding
antimiscegenation
statues.
the
language
was
broad,
the
language
was
sweeping,
the
language
meant
to
include
equal
protection
for
negroes
that
was
at
the
very
heart
of
it
and
that
equal
protection
included
the
right
to
marry
as
any
other
human
being
had
the
right
to
marry
subject
to
only
the
same
limitations.
the
state
has
said
that
the
amount
of
persons
other
than
negroes
and
whites
involved
is
very
insignificant
and
very
small.
well,
this
is
the
first
negro-white
miscegenation
case
in
virginia
to
come
to
the
supreme
court.
it
is
the
first
negro-white
miscegenation
case
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
there
have
been
a
handful
of
others,
every
single
one
of
them
involving
a
person
of
what
might
be
called
yellow
extraction
or
malaysian
or
filipino
and
white
persons.
so
to
say
that
the
problem
itself
is
insignificant
in
virginia
is
not
at
all
true
which
reflected
in
the
actual
case
law
in
virginia,
the
case
of
calma
versus
calma,
involved
a
filipino,
the
case
of
name
versus
name
involved
a
possible
oriental
whose
background
was
not
exactly
clear
from
the
record.
now,
the
state
is
ignoring
a
very
important
point
which
we
cannot
overemphasize
if
this
decision
only
goes
to
sections
58
and
59
of
the
statute
and
that
is
the
right
of
richard
and
mildred
loving
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
or
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
knowing
that
the
sheriff
will
not
be
knocking
on
their
door
or
shining
a
light
in
their
face
in
the
privacy
of
their
bedroom
for
illicit
cohabitation.
if
58
and
59
are
found
unconstitutional
and
54
is
allowed
to
remain
on
the
books
that
is
precisely
what
can
happen.
it
will
be
an
exact
repetition
of
what
in
fact
did
happen
to
them
and
this
court
will
not
be
given
the
lovings
the
relief
they
require.
the
lovings
have
the
right
to
go
to
sleep
at
night,
knowing
that
should
not
--
should
they
not
awake
in
the
morning,
their
children
would
have
the
right
to
inherent
from
them
under
intestacy.
they
have
the
right
to
be
secure
and
knowing
that
if
they
go
to
sleep
and
do
not
wake
in
the
morning
that
one
of
them
or
survivor
of
them
has
the
right
to
social
security
benefits.
all
of
these
are
denied
to
them
and
they
will
not
be
denied
to
them
if
the
whole
miscegenous
--
antimiscegenation
scheme
of
virginia
sections
20
through
50
--
through
20-60
are
found
unconstitutional.
while,
i
do
not
place
great
emphasis
on
the
work
of
rabbi
gordon,
i
feel
compelled
to
note
that
in
the
state's
quotes
from
rabbi
gordon,
there
is
conspicuous
absence
of
the
following
quotation
on
appendix
page
4
which
would
fit
uniquely
in
the
ellipsis
shown
there.
rabbi
gordon
states
and
it
is
not
printed
in
the
state's
brief,
our
democracy
would
soon
be
defeated
if
any
group
on
the
american
scene
was
required
to
cut
itself
off
from
context
with
persons
of
other
religions
or
races.
the
segregation
of
any
group
religious
or
racial
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
is
unthinkable
and
even
dangerous
to
the
body
politic.
now,
virginia
stands
here
today
and
in
this
loving
case
for
the
first
time
tries
to
find
a
justification
other
than
white
racial
supremacy
for
the
existence
of
its
statute.
mr.
mcilwaine
is
quite
candid
that
this
is
a
current
day
justification
not
the
justification
of
the
framers.
on
the
one
hand,
i
see
a
little
dilemma
here.
he
asks
that
the
court
look
to
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
to
ignore
the
framers
of
the
1924
act
to
preserve
racial
integrity
in
virginia.
it
is
not
a
dilemma
i
would
like
to
be
in.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
well,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
statement
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
no,
but
i
--
no,
i
don't
feel
that
dilemma
at
all
your
honor.
we
do
not
for
a
moment
concede
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
clear
or
conclusive
that
they
meant
to
exclude
miscegenetic
marriages
while
mr.
mcilwaine
has
stood
here
and
i
believe
conceded
that
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
1924
act
of
--
of
racial
integrity
was
a
white
supremacy
act.
so
i
don't
feel
it
at
all
uncomfortable
in
that
situation.
now,
on
the
one
hand,
the
state
urges
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
prohibit
or
to
--
for
the
statute
to
go
against
smaller
minority
groups
that
exist
in
virginia.
and
i
say
that
why
have
they
taken
the
trouble
in
section
54
to
prohibit
marriages
between
whites
and
malaysians
or
white
and
anybody
else.
the
fact
of
the
manner
is
that
it
is
important
to
the
statutory
scheme
of
virginia
to
discriminate
against
anybody
but
white
people.
now,
while
there
is
no
definitive
case
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
new
york
couple
involved
in
a
miscegenetic
marriage
moving
to
virginia
will
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony
and
i
admit
it
might
be
open
to
some
judicial
interpretation.
i
feel
strongly
and
i
think
the
court
can
reach
this
decision
and
--
and
i
think
some
authorities
writing
in
law
journals
have
reached
the
decision
that
under
section
20-59,
referring
to
any
white
person,
intermarrying
with
a
colored
person,
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony
and
shall
be
punished
by
confinement
of
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
one
or
more
than
five
years.
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
doubt
appearing
in
a
very
same
racial
integrity
act
of
1924.
five
sections
after
the
act
which
says
it
shall
hereafter
the
unlawful
for
any
white
person
in
the
state
to
marry
any
save
a
white
person.
i
don't
see
how
it
is
possible
to
conclude
that
even
a
new
york
couple
would
not
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony
in
virginia.
in
any
event,
the
state
is
conceded
that
they
certainly
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime
that
of
illicit
cohabitation
and
has
left
be
rest
open.
we
argue
that
certainly
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
some
prosecutors
at
the
lower
trial
level
some
places
in
virginia
that
would
have
no
compunction
whatsoever
in
going
ahead
and
prosecuting
under
59
as
a
felony
couples
moving
into
the
state
involved
in
miscegenetic
marriage.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
not
to
our
knowledge
and
to
our
research,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
cohen
i
believe
some
of
the
northern
states
did,
your
honor.
i
think
the
state's
position
and
the
appellant's
position
come
together
and
agree
at
only
one
point
but
the
court
should
not
go
into
the
morass
of
sociological
evidence
that
is
available
on
both
sides
of
the
question.
we
strongly
urge
that
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
our
position
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
specifically
related
to
it
being
an
anti-racial
amendment,
give
this
court
sufficient
breadth
and
sufficient
depth
to
invalidate
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
thank
you.
