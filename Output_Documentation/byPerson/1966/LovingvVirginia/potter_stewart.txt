well,
surely
that's
--
there's
some
limit
on
that.
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
--
that
a
state
could
forbid
a
marriage
between
a
brother
and
a
sister,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
you're
--
you're
not
arguing
about
any
race
question.
you're
arguing
complete
freedom
to
contract,
aren't
you,
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
but
some
--
some
people
might
think
it
was
reasonable
that
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
forbid
first
cousins
to
marry
each
other,
state
rights
to
live
does
have
such
a
law
prohibiting
first
cousins
for
marrying
each
other.
now
the
--
because
large
body
of
opinion
might
think
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious.
does
that
mean
that
the
state
has
no
constitutional
power
to
pass
such
a
statute?

age
and
i

i
suppose

of

justice

stewart
mr.
mcilwaine,
wouldn't
it
be
pretty
clear
in
the
absence,
in
the
absence
of
the
specific
legislative
history
which
you
refer
us?
if
it
just
were
no
history,
wouldn't
be
pretty
clear
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
provide
that
every
state
had
to
treat
negroes
citizen
the
same
as
white
citizens
so
far
as
their
laws
go?
isn't
that
what
the
equal
protection
clause
means?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
that
was
the
very
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause
coming
as
it
did
after
the
--
in
the
light
of
the
civil
war.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
what
is
cause
and
what
is
effect,
assuming
the
validity
of
these
statistics.
i
suppose
one
could
be
argued
that
one
reason
that
marriages
of
this
kind
are
sometimes
unsuccessful
as
the
existence
of
the
kind
of
laws
that
are
in
issue
here
and
the
--
and
the
attitudes
of
laws
reflect,
is
that
correct?
