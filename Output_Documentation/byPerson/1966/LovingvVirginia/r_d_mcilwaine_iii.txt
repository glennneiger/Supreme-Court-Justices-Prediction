mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
i
appear
as
one
of
counsel
for
the
appellee
in
support
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
our
state
affirming
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
two
statutes
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
in
view
of
what
has
been
said
before,
it
may
not
be
inappropriate
at
this
point
to
emphasize
that
there
are
only
two
statutes
before
this
court
for
consideration,
section
20-58
and
20-59
of
the
virginia
code.
these
statutes
in
their
combined
effect,
prohibit
white
people
from
marrying
colored
people
and
colored
people
from
marrying
white
people
under
the
same
penal
section
and
forbids
citizens
of
virginia
of
either
race
from
leaving
the
state
with
intent
and
purpose
of
evading
this
law.
no
other
statutes
are
involved
in
this
case.
no
attempt
has
been
made
by
any
virginia
officials
to
apply
any
other
statute
to
the
marital
relationship
before
this
court.
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
can
be
read
from
beginning
to
end
without
finding
any
other
statute
mentioned
in
it
except
20-58
and
20-59
with
the
exception
of
that
one
provision
which
relates
to
the
power
of
court
to
suspend
the
execution
of
sentence
upon
which
ground
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
referred
this
case
back
to
the
lower
court
to
have
a
new
condition
of
suspension
imposed.
with
that
exception,
only
two
provisions
of
the
virginia
code
are
mentioned.
therefore,
we
take
the
position
that
these
are
the
only
statutes
before
the
court
and
anything
that
may
have
to
do
with
any
other
provision
of
the
virginia
code
which
imposes
a
prohibition
on
the
white
race
only
or
has
to
do
with
certificates
of
racial
composition,
whatever
they
may
be,
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
this
is
a
statute
which
applies
to
a
virginia
situation
and
forbids
the
intermarriage
of
the
white
and
colored
races.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
would
only
be
significant
mr.
chief
justice
with
respect
to
that
provision
20-54
which
is
not
before
the
court
which
says
that
a
white
person
shall
not
marry
any
other
save
a
white
person
or
a
person
having
no
other
admixture
of
blood
and
white
and
american-indian.
that
is
a
special
statute.
that
is
the
20-54
statute
against
which
i
myself
could
find
a
number
of
constitutional
objections
perhaps
in
that
it
imposes
a
restriction
upon
one
race
alone
which
it
does
not
oppose
on
the
other
races
and
therefore,
more
stringently
curtails
the
rights
of
one
racial
group.
but
so
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
this
is
because
in
virginia,
we
have
only
two
races
of
people
which
are
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
state
of
virginia
in
sufficient
numbers
to
constitute
a
classification
with
which
the
legislature
must
deal.
that
is
why
i
say
the
white
and
the
colored
prohibition
here
completely
controls
the
racial
picture
with
which
virginia
is
faced.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
we
have
indians
your
honor,
but
this
is
the
point
that
we
make
with
respect
to
them.
under
the
census
figures
of
1960,
79
and
some
odds
hundreds
percent
of
the
virginia
population
was
made
up
of
white
people,
20
and
some
odd
hundred
percent
of
the
virginia
population
was
made
up
of
colored
people,
whites
and
negroes
by
definition
of
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
bureau
of
the
census.
thus,
99
and
44
one
hundredths
percent
of
the
virginia
population
falls
into
these
two
racial
categories.
all
other
racial
classes
in
virginia
combined
do
not
constitute
as
much
as
one-fourth
of
1%
of
the
virginia
population.
therefore,
we
say
that
this
problem
of
the
intermarriage
of
whites
and
orientals
or
negroes
and
orientals
or
any
of
these
two
classes
with
polynesians
or
indians
or
asiatic
indians
is
not
a
problem
with
which
virginia
has
faced
and
one
which
is
not
required
to
adopt
its
policy
forbidding
interracial
marriage
too.
a
statute
of
course
does
not
have
to
apply
with
mathematical
precision,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
virginia
population,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
statute
before
the
court
in
this
case
does
apply
almost
with
mathematical
precision
since
it
covers
all
the
dangers
which
virginia
has
a
right
to
apprehend
from
interracial
marriage
in
that
it
prohibits
the
intermarriage
of
those
two
groups
which
constitute
more
than
99%
of
the
virginia
population.
now,
so
far
as
the
particular
appellants
in
this
case
are
concerned,
there
is
no
question
of
constitutional
vagueness
or
doubtful
definition.
it
is
a
matter
of
record,
agreed
to
by
all
counsel
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
and
in
the
brief
that
one
of
the
appellants
here
is
a
white
person
within
the
definition
of
the
virginia
law,
the
other
appellant
is
a
colored
person
within
the
definition
of
virginia
law.
thus,
the
court
is
simply
faced
with
the
proposition
of
whether
or
not
a
state
may
validly
forbid
the
interracial
marriage
of
two
groups,
the
white
and
the
colored
in
the
context
of
the
present
statute.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
we
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
marriage
would
be
recognized
as
valid
in
virginia
even
though
it
was
contracted
by
parties
who
are
not
residents
of
the
state
of
virginia
under
the
conflict
of
laws
principle
that
a
marriage
valid
were
celebrated
is
valid
everywhere.
this
would
be
a
serious
question
and
under
virginia
law,
it
is
highly
questionable
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
recognized
in
virginia,
especially
since
virginia
has
a
very
strong
policy
against
interracial
marriage
and
the
implementing
statutes
declare
that
marriages
between
white
and
colored
people
shall
be
absolutely
void
without
decree
of
divorce
or
other
legal
process,
the
implementing
statute
which
forbids
virginia
citizens
to
leave
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
law
and
returning,
the
exception
to
the
conflict
of
laws
principally
i've
stated
that
a
marriage
valid
was
celebrated
would
be
valid
everywhere
except
where
contrary
to
the
long
--
to
the
strong
local
public
policy.
the
virginia
statute
here
involved
thus
expresses
a
strong
local
public
policy
against
the
intermarriage
of
white
and
colored
people.
now,
with
respect
to
any
other
interracial
marriage,
this
--
the
policy
of
the
virginia
statutes
here
involved
does
not
express
any
sentiment
at
all.
and
we
do
not
have
any
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
mr.
justice
harlan
which
would
shed
light
on
that
proposition
insofar
as
other
races
are
concerned.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
the
--
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
would.
i
do
not
know
whether
virginia
is
--
or
any
state
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
is
requires
to
recognize
a
marriage
which
is
contrary
to
its
own
law,
especially
with
respect
to
matters
within
its
own
state.
now,
the
appellants
of
course
have
asserted
that
the
virginia
statute
here
under
attack
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
assert
that
it
is
not,
and
we
do
so
on
a
basis
of
to
contentions
and
two
contentions
only.
the
first
contention
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
viewed
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
has
no
effect,
whatever
upon
the
power
of
states
to
enact
antimiscegenation
laws
specifically,
antimiscegenation
laws
forbidding
the
intermarriage
of
white
and
colored
persons
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
court
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
authorized
to
infringe
the
power
of
the
state.
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
read
in
the
life
of
its
history,
touch
much
less
diminished
the
power
of
a
states
in
this
regard.
the
second
contention,
an
alternative
contention
is,
that
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
be
deemed
to
apply
to
state
antimiscegenation
statutes,
then
these
statutes
serve
a
legitimate,
legislative
objective
of
preventing
a
sociological,
psychological
evils
which
attend
interracial
marriages,
and
is
a
--
an
expression,
a
rational
expression
of
a
policy
which
virginia
has
a
right
to
adopt.
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
is
concerned,
we
do
not
understand
that
this
court
has
ever
avowed
in
principle,
the
proposition,
that
it
is
necessary
in
construing
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
give
effect
to
the
intention
of
the
framers.
with
respect
to
the
instant
situation,
you
are
not
presented
with
any
question
involving
a
dubious
application
of
certain
principles
to
a
situation
which
was
unforeseen
or
unknown
to
those
who
framed
the
principles.
the
precise
question
before
this
court
today,
the
validity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
a
statute
forbidding
the
marriage
of
whites
and
negroes
was
precisely
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
100
years
ago
when
it
adopted
the
amendment.
the
situation
is
perfectly
clear
that
those
who
considered
the
amendment
against
a
charge
of
infringing
state
power
to
forbid
white
and
colored
marriages,
specifically
excluding
that
power
from
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
your
honor.
we
get
it
from
the
--
specifically
from
the
debates
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
get
it
specifically
your
honor,
from
the
debates
leading
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
debates
on
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
construed
by
members
of
this
court
a
number
of
times
in
its
historical
setting.
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
instances
that
the
specific
debates
on
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
which
act
ultimately
became
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
the
most
material
relating
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
in
this
situation,
by
the
time
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
had
been
debated
and
passed,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
--
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
would
infringe
the
power
of
the
states
to
pass
antimiscegenation
statutes
was
so
completely
settled,
that
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
resolution
was
brought
on,
the
question
was
no
longer
considered
to
be
in
open
one.
the
dissent
on
our
brief
and
pointed
out
by
the
adversaries
that
we
take
the
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
in
part
to
place
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
in
the
constitution
beyond
the
reach
of
shifting
congressional
majority.
we
say
in
part
only
because
as
mr.
justice
black
has
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
adamson
case,
there
were
a
number
of
reasons
why
people
thought
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
included.
some
people
thought
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
was
absolutely
unconstitutional
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
pass
an
amendment
to
validate
it.
others
thought
that
the
act
was
perfectly
constitutional
but
that
it
could
be
repealed
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
place
it
in
the
constitution
to
keep
it
from
being
repealed.
still,
others
thought
that
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
nothing
but
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866
in
another
shape.
nobody
suggested
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
its
adoption
into
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
expanded
the
rights
which
were
covered
in
the
1866
bill.
and
certainly
no
one
suggested
that
what
was
expressly
removed
from
the
1866
act
was
reinserted
in
the
constitution
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
within
a
period
of
just
a
few
months.
now,
the
debates
on
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
clearly
show
that
the
proponents,
those
who
had
the
billion
charge,
those
who
were
instrumental
in
passing
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clearly
in
answer
to
questions
put
by
their
adversaries
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
bill
had
no
application
to
the
states'
power
to
forbid
marriages
between
white
and
colored
persons,
not
simply
amalgamation
but
specifically
between
white
and
colored
persons.
this
was
repeatedly
stated
by
senator
trumbull
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
who
steered
the
bill
to
the
passage
and
was
instrumental
in
passing
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
senator
william
pitt
fessenden
of
maine,
who
was
the
leading
republican
member
on
the
joint
committee
of
reconstruction
of
fifteen,
and
by
various
other
members
who
supported
the
bill,
and
steered
it
to
passage.
now,
text
writers
have
disagreed
as
to
whether
or
not
the
charge
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
would
invalidate
state
laws
was
seriously
made
or
whether
it
was
made
for
political
purposes
simply
as
a
smoke
screen.
regardless
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
made,
the
historical
fact
remains
that
the
challenge
was
put
by
those
who
disagreed
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
that
it
would
affect
the
power
of
the
states
to
pass
antimiscegenation
statutes,
and
the
proponents
and
the
managers
who
had
the
bill
in
charge
absolutely
denied
that
it
would
have
any
such
effect.
no
one
who
voted
for
sponsored
or
espoused
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
dared
to
suggest
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
invalidating
state
antimiscegenation
statutes.
plus,
we
have
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
those
who
framed
and
adopted
the
amendment
to
exclude
this
area
of
state
power
from
the
reach
of
the
amendment.
and
this
history
is
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
the
state
legislatures,
which
ratified
the
amendment,
clearly
did
not
understand
that
it
would
have
any
effect
at
all
upon
their
power
to
pass
antimiscegenation
statutes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir,
we
do
not.
we
simply
say
that
it
relates
to
a
statute
which
is
above
and
beyond
or
extraneous
to
the
interracial
marriage
statutes
specifically
left
this
question
open
for
future
decision
and
the
question
left
open
in
mclaughlin
is
now
here.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
do
not
think
they
take
any
comfort
from
mclaughlin
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor.
they
take
comfort
of
course
from
the
dicta
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
make
the
criminal
act
turn
upon
the
color
of
the
skin
of
the
individual
and
if
that
dicta
for
stands
unchallenged,
they
have
reason
to
take
out
--
proponent
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
it
has
nothing
[laughter]
to
do
with
the
fourth
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
nor
do
i
understand
it
in
mclaughlin
that
the
court
considered
this
point.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir
but
we
could
--
we
do
not
put
forward
the
proposition
but
the
pace
case
does
justify
the
statute.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
mean,
so
if
they
want
to
take
comfort
in
that,
that's
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
let
them
be
our
guests.
we
simply
say
that
the
power
of
the
state
to
forbid
interracial
marriages,
if
we
get
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment,
can
be
justified
on
other
grounds.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
our
basic
position.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
legislative
history?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
legislative
history
would
support
the
proposition
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
lewd
and
lascivious
cohabitation
and
so
forth.
my
legislative
history
or
the
legislative
history
which
we
are
set
out
specifically
relates
to
interracial
marriage.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
would
like
to
point
out
one
fact
which
--
or
one
circumstance
which
we
think
is
analogous.
perhaps,
the
most
far
reaching
decision
of
this
court,
so
far
as
the
popular
mind
is
concerned
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
century
has
been
brown
against
board
of
education.
in
that
case,
the
matter
was
argued
in
1952
and
in
1953,
this
court
restored
the
case
to
docket
for
re-argument
and
entered
an
order
in
which
it
had
called
the
attention
of
all
counsel
in
that
case
to
certain
matters
which
the
court
en
banc
wished
to
have
counsel
consider.
the
first
of
these
questions
was,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
court's
order,
"what
evidence
is
there
that
the
congress
which
submitted,
and
the
state
legislatures,
and
conventions
which
ratified
the
fourteenth
amendment
contemplated
or
did
not
contemplate,
understood
or
did
not
understand
that
it
would
abolish
segregation
in
public
schools?"
now,
of
course
it
cannot
be
--
no
presumption
can
be
indulged
that
--
that
question
was
put
to
the
eminent
counsel
in
that
case
simply
as
an
academic
exercise.
the
matter
was
material
to
this
court
to
determine
what
the
evidence
was
with
respect
to
the
intention
of
those
who
adopted
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
legislatures
which
ratified
it.
it
was
material
to
the
proper
disposition
of
that
case.
and
in
response
to
that
question,
on
behalf
of
south
carolina,
mr.
john
w.
davis
filed
a
brief
in
excess
of
150
pages
and
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
the
former
attorney
general
of
virginia
and
private
counsel
filed
another
brief
in
excess
of
150
pages
on
that
point.
the
current
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states,
on
behalf
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people,
mr.
thurgood
marshall,
also
filed
a
brief
of
a
similar
length
in
which
both
sides
of
this
question
was
presented
to
this
court.
in
view
of
the
conflict
which
the
court
found
out
the
result,
the
court
said
that
the
legislative
history
on
this
point
was
unclear.
now,
that
proposition
cannot
arise
in
this
case
because
the
legislative
history
on
this
point
is
all
one
way.
no
one
has
been
found
who
has
analyzed
this
problem,
who
has
suggested
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
understanding
of
the
legislatures
which
ratified
it
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
affected
to
any
degree
the
power
of
the
states
to
forbid
the
intermarriage
of
white
and
colored
citizens.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
the
proponents
in
saying
that
he
did
not
cover,
the
bases
placed
were
two.
one,
that
if
the
statute
equally
forbadee
the
white
race
to
marry
the
colored
race
and
the
colored
race
to
marry
the
white
race
then
in
the
opinion
of
the
framers
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection
or
due
process.
in
other
words,
the
classification
itself
was
not
a
violation.
second
was
that
historically,
the
regulation
of
marital
relationship
was
within
the
states
and
it
was
no
intent
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
have
any
effect
at
all
upon
the
states'
power
over
marriage.
these
were
two
bases.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
has
no
effect
on
the
intention
of
the
framers,
the
fact
was
it
has
not
sustained
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
how
can
a
subsequent
difference
in
approach
of
this
court
after
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
dead
and
buried
possibly
have
any
effect
upon
what
they
intended
when
they
wrote
this
language?
now,
under
this,
the
language
which
they
used
in
saying
that
it
had
no
relate
--
had
no
effect
upon
the
state's
power
over
marriage,
they
also
said
and
provided
no
discrimination
is
made
by.
it's
clear
under
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
if
a
statute
had
forbade
white
people
to
marry
colored
people
and
then
had
a
different
penalty
proscribed
for
violation
of
that
statute
that
even
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
have
thought
that
that
would
have
been
unconstitutional
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
specifically
designed
to
meet
that
difference
in
penalty
proposition.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
your
honor.
these
--
the
material
which
we
have
set
at
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
absolutely
contemporaneous.
the
fourteenth
amendment
resolution
was
brought
on
for
consideration
in
early
1866
and
it
stayed
in
committee
while
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
were
steered
to
passage.
then
after
they
were
steered
to
passage,
the
debate
began
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
by
the
time
that
began,
this
question
of
whether
or
not
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
had
any
effect
upon
the
power
of
the
states
to
forbid
interracial
marriages
was
so
thoroughly
settled,
that
it
did
not
even
become
an
issue.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
the
act
was
constitutional,
unconstitutional
needed
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
substantiate
it,
but
there's
no
suggestion
ever
made
that
it
expanded
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
our
reading
of
the
legislative
history
is
sufficient
to
lead
us
to
believe
that
if
anybody
had
suggested
that
it
would
have
that
affect,
the
entire
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
have
been
lost.
no
one,
the
proponents
would
never
have
suggested
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
going
to
abolish
the
power
of
the
states
to
forbid
interracial
marriage.
thus
we
say
that
if
the
legislative
history
is
given
effect
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
virginia
cannot
be
held
to
violate
it.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
sum
up
the
argument
which
we
have
made
on
behalf
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
referring
to
a
statement
of
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
recent
case
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
two
sentences
which
read
as
follows,
"i
see
no
reason
to
read
into
the
constitution,
meanings
it
did
not
have
when
it
was
adopted
and
which
had
not
been
put
into
it
since.
the
proceedings
of
the
original
constitutional
convention
show
beyond
all
doubt
that
power
to
veto
or
negative
state
laws
were
denied
in
congress."
we
respectfully
assert
that
there
was
no
propriety
in
this
court's
reading
into
the
constitution
meanings
it
did
not
have
when
it
was
adopted
or
expanding
the
reach
of
the
constitution
to
embrace
a
subject
which
was
specifically
excluded
by
the
framers.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that's
reinforced
by
the
legislative
history
and
i
don't
know
exactly
how
to
consider
the
question
aside
from
the
legislative
history,
but
that
is
clearly
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
itself.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
framers
understood
that
in
their
intention,
a
law
which
equally
forbade
the
members
of
one
race
to
marry
members
of
another
race
with
same
penal
sanction
on
both
did
treat
the
individuals
of
both
races
equally.
turning
then
to
our
alternative
argument
which
we
say,
can
only
be
reached
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
ignored
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
deemed
to
reach
the
state
power
to
enact
laws
relating
to
the
marriage
relationship,
we
say
that
the
prevention
of
interracial
marriage
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
state
power.
that
there
is
a
rational
classification,
setting
so
far
as
the
virginia
population
is
concerned,
for
preventing
marriages
between
white
and
colored
people
who
make
up
the
--
almost
the
entirety
of
the
state
population,
and
that
this
is
supported
by
the
prevailing
climate
of
scientific
opinion.
we
take
apart
the
position
that
while
there
is
evidence
on
both
sides
of
this
question,
when
such
a
situation
exist
it
is
for
the
legislature
to
draw
its
conclusions
and
that
these
conclusions
are
entitled
to
wait
and
unless
it
can
be
clearly
said
that
there
is
no
debatable
question
that
a
statute
of
this
type
cannot
be
declared
unconstitutional.
we
start
with
the
proposition,
on
this
connection,
that
it
is
the
family
which
constitutes
the
structural
element
of
society
and
that
marriage
is
the
legal
basis
upon
which
families
are
formed.
consequently,
this
court
has
held,
in
a
numerous
decisions
over
the
years,
that
society
is
structured
on
the
institution
of
marriage
that
it
has
more
to
do
with
a
welfare
and
civilizations
of
the
people
that
any
other
institutions
and
that
out
of
the
fruits
of
marriage
spring
relationships
and
responsibilities
with
which
the
state
is
necessarily
required
the
deal.
text
writers
and
judicial
writers
agree
that
the
state
has
a
natural
direct
and
vital
interest
in
maximizing
the
number
of
successful
marriages,
which
lead
to
stable
homes
and
families
and
in
minimizing
those
which
do
not.
it
is
clear
from
the
most
recent
available
evidence
on
the
psycho-sociological
aspect
of
this
question
that
intermarried
families
are
subjected
to
much
greater
pressures
and
problems
then
those
of
the
intramarried
and
that
the
state's
prohibition
of
interracial
marriage
for
this
reason
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
the
prohibition
of
polygamous
marriage,
or
incestuous
marriage
or
the
prescription
of
minimum
ages
at
which
people
may
marry
and
the
prevention
of
the
marriage
of
people
who
are
mentally
incompetent.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
that
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
prohibition
of
interracial
marriage
is
stronger
than
that
for
the
prohibition
of
interreligious
marriage.
but
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
we
say
that
principally
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
we
say
it
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
authority
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
particularly,
this
one
volume,
which
we
have
cited
from
copiously
in
our
brief
which
is
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
this
is
a
book
by
dr.
albert
i.
gordon,
your
honor,
which
is
characterized
as
the
definitive
book
by
dr.
albert
i.
gordon,
which
is
characterized
as
the
definitive
book
on
intermarriage,
and
has
the
most
careful,
up
to
date,
methodologically
sound
study
of
intermarriage
in
north
america
that
exists.
it
is
entitled
"intermarriage,
interfaith,
interracial,
interethnic."
now,
our
proposition
on
the
psycho-sociological
aspects
of
this
question
is
bottomed
almost
exclusively
on
this
particular
volume.
this
is
the
work
of
a
jewish
rabbi
who
is
also,
has
a
m.a.
in
sociology
and
a
ph.d.
in
social
anthropology.
it
is
a
statistical
study
of
over
5000
marriages
which
was
aided
by
the
computers
of
the
harvard
laboratory
of
social
relations
and
the
mit
computation
center.
this
book
has
been
given
statistical
form
and
basis
to
the
proposition
that
from
the
psycho-sociological
point
of
view,
interracial
marriages
are
detrimental
to
the
individual,
to
the
family,
and
to
society.
i
do
not
say
that
the
author
of
this
book
would
advocate
the
prohibition
of
such
marriages
by
law
but
we
do
say
that
he
personally
and
clearly
expresses
his
view
as
a
social
scientist
that
interracial
marriages
are
definitely
undesirable
that
they
hold
no
promise
for
a
bright
and
happy
future
for
mankind.
and
that
the
interracial
marriages
bequeath
to
the
progeny
of
those
marriages,
more
psychological
problems
than
parents
have
a
right
to
bequeath
to
them.
as
i
say,
this
book
has
been
widely
accepted
and
it
was
published
in
1964
as
being
the
definitive
book
on
intermarriage
in
north
american
that
exists.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
that,
your
honor,
from
any
of
the
two
that
i've
given.
he's
a
rabbi
in
temple
emanuel
in
newton
center,
massachusetts.
i
do
not
understand
that
the
--
and
certainly,
the
religious
view
of
the
orthodox
or
the
conservative
or
the
reformed
jewish
phase
disagree
necessarily
on
this
particular
proposition,
but
i
cannot
say
whether
dr.
gordon
is
orthodox
or
a
reformed
jewish
rabbi.
i
am
more
interested
of
course
in
his
credentials
as
a
scientist
for
this
purpose,
as
a
doctor
of
social
anthropology
and
as
a
sociologist
and
of
course,
i
am
in
his
religious
affiliation.
but
it
is
clear,
unmistakably
clear,
and
we
have
set
it
forth
as
i
say,
in
our
brief
and
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
results
of
the
study
which
has
been
made
and
which
is
embodied
in
this
volume.
as
i
say,
it
was
published
in
1964
and
some
of
the
statements
which
made
in
it
based
upon
the
demonstrably
--
statistically
demonstrably
greater
ratio
of
a
marry
--
of
divorce,
annulment
in
intermarried
couples
than
intramarried
couples.
dr.
gordon
has
stated
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
is
my
conviction
that
intermarriage
is
definitely
inadvisible,
that
they
are
wrong
because
they
are
most
frequently
if
not
solely
entered
into
under
the
present
day
circumstances
by
people
who
have
a
rebellious
attitude
towards
--
towards
society,
self-hatred,
neurotic
tendencies,
immaturity
and
other
detrimental
psychological
factors.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
it
is
more
the
latter,
the
attitudes
that
perhaps
the
laws
reflect.
i
don't
find
anywhere
in
this
that
the
existence
of
law.
it
is
the
attitude
which
society
has
taught
interracial
marriages,
which
in
detailing
his
opposition
says,
"causes
a
child
to
have
almost
insuperable
difficulties
in
identification
and
that
the
problems
which
a
child
of
an
interracial
marriage
faces
are
those
which
no
child
can
come
through
without
damage
to
himself."
now
if
the
state
has
an
interest
in
marriage,
if
it
has
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
number
of
stable
marriages
and
in
protecting
the
progeny
of
interracial
marriages
from
these
problems,
then
clearly,
there
is
scientific
evidence
available
that
this
is
so.
it
is
not
infrequent
that
the
children
of
intermarried
parents
are
referred
to
not
merely
as
the
children
of
intermarried
parents
but
as
the
victims
of
intermarried
parents
and
as
the
martyrs
of
intermarried
parents.
these
are
the
direct
quotes
from
the
volume.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
understand
that
he
does.
all
that
he
purports
to
say
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
biological
difference
is,
this
is
not
his
field,
in
other
words,
genetics
and
biology.
he
reviews
the
materials
on
this
and
concludes
for
the
purpose
of
his
study
that
biologically
and
genetically,
there
is
probably
no
justification
for
the
prevention
of
intermarriage.
then
he
takes
it
further
into
the
psycho-sociological
field
and
its
effect
upon
children
and
upon
the
intermarried
couples
and
this
is
what
his
views
are
based
upon.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
we
take
two
positions
with
respect
to
that.
one
is
that
the
evidence
there
is
negative.
they
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
reliable
evidence
that
there
are
any
harmful
consequences
of
intermarriage.
they
do
not
say
that
the
evidence
shows
conclusively
that
there
are
none.
their
position
in
the
unesco's
statement
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
any
harmful
effect.
that's
the
first
position,
that
it
is
negative
on
this
point.
the
second
position
is
set
out
in
appendix
c
of
our
brief
in
which
the
next
year,
after
the
publication
of
the
unesco's
statement,
unesco
also
published
another
book
entitled
"the
race
concepts"
results
of
an
inquiry
in
which
it
set
forth
the
criticisms
that
had
been
leveled
at
that
statement
by
equally
eminent
anthropologists
and
biologists
with
respect
to
it.
and
we
have
on
page
12
through
22
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
published
extracted
from
the
second
unesco
publication,
a
symposium
of
the
critiques
level
at
the
unesco
statement
as
well
as
other
scientists
who
agreed
with
the
unesco
statement.
so
we
said
that
the
unesco
statement
is
by
no
means
definitive
and
it
is
not
the
statement
which
is
at
all
joined
in
by
the
scientific
community
especially
on
that
point.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
guess
that
they
would
not,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
find
that
on
the
psycho-sociological
aspects
there
is
any
disagreement
with
his
work.
no
one
has
challenged
the
statistics
in
this
work
and
it
has
been
widely
received
as
we
put
--
set
forth
in
our
brief
as
putting
statistical
form
on
an
embarrassing
gap
in
the
literature
of
the
social
sciences.
and
it
has
been
--
as
i
say
received
by
--
not
only
by
scientists
but
by
religious
individuals
as
well.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir,
but
there
is
equally
in
the
second
publication
of
unesco,
there
is
equally
stringent
criticism
of
that
statement
as
being
an
attempt
to
close
a
system
of
knowledge
and
to
state
that
there
is
no
scientific
evidence
the
other
way
when
that
is
simply
not
the
case,
and
the
--
this
material
which
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
if
some
the
second
unesco's
statement.
in
other
words,
unesco
itself
realized
that
its
first
publication
elicited
such
criticism
that
it
felt
down
to
put
this
criticism
as
well
as
other
supplementing
unesco
statement
in
a
second
publication,
which
shows
that
there
is
by
no
means
unanimity
of
agreement
on
this
point.
and
we
have
pointed
out
in
further
appendices
to
our
brief,
the
1964,
the
unesco
statement
of
course
in
1951
and
52,
we
have
pointed
out
the
recent
statements
of
professor
engel,
professor
of
physiology
at
chicago
university
in
which
he
cautions
against
interracial
marriages
on
the
ground,
not
of
any
specific
finding
of
his
own,
but
on
the
grounds
that
there
has
not
been
sufficient
scientific
investigation
of
this
matter
for
a
physiologist
at
least
to
determine
the
true
effects,
physiologically
speaking
of
interracial
marriage
and
cautions
against
it.
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
libraries
are
filled
with
criticizes
and
research
studies
of
the
cautionary
nature
which
advised
against
it
on
a
biological
and
genetic
point
of
view.
a
number
of
these
were
cited
in
perez
against
sharp
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
we
have
updated
them
by
the
citation
of
additional
authorities
most
of
which
were
published
in
the
last
five
years,
which
updates
that
study.
perhaps,
i
can
summarize
this.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
would
your
honor.
i
have
stated
clearly
in
the
brief
that
the
court
to
undertake
to
end
of
this
controversy,
the
court
would
find
itself
admired
in
a
sembonian
bag
of
conflicting
scientific
opinions
which
i
assure
the
court
is
sufficiently
broad,
sufficiently
fluid
and
sufficiently
deep
to
swallow
up
the
entire
federal
judiciary.
if
you
read
one
volume
on
this
point,
you
find
20
additional
authorities
cited
in
that
one
volume
which
you
haven't
read.
by
the
time
you
read
six
articles
on
this
point,
you've
got
a
bibliography
of
a
150
books
on
the
same
subject,
pro
and
con.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
on
these
--
the
two
statutes
before
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
that
is
not
so.
so
far
as
20-54
is
concerned,
the
act
of
virginia
of
1924
to
preserve
racial
purity,
i
think
that
is
unquestionably
true.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor
i
think
that
there
is.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
its
justification
for
saying
that
is
not
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
you
mean
--
i
think
historically
that
the
--
that
the
legislatures
that
which
enacted
them
had
that
thought
in
mind.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
i
think
that
--
that's
clear.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
--
that's
which
the
original
enactments
were
rested.
i
think
that's
perfectly
clear.
but
your
honor
i
say
that
you
are
facing
a
problem
in
1967
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
the
prohibition
your
honor
works
both
ways.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
prohibition
works
both
ways.
you
say
a
man
that
is
prohibited
from
marrying
into
another
race
feels
inferior.
the
prohibition
also
prohibits
the
white
person
to
marry
the
colored
person.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
motivation
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
motivation
of
the
earlier
statutes,
if
you
--
by
motivation
you
undertake
to
analyze
the
feelings
of
the
individual
members
of
the
legislature
that
were
responsible
for
the
adaption
of
the
statutes,
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
see
how
that
can
affect
the
constitutional
problem
which
is
presented
to
this
court
where
an
enactment
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
is
on
trial
in
which
we
submit
was
beyond
the
scope
of
fourteenth
amendment
as
the
first
proposition
and
as
a
second
proposition
even
if
it
wasn't
beyond
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
is
subjected
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
test
it
is
a
justifiable
regulation
in
view
of
today's
evidence
on
the
point.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
don't
have
any
prohibition
against
anyone
in
virginia,
so
far
as
these
statutes
are
concerned
marrying
a
mongolian
or
malay.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
they
are,
your
honor
and
if
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
that
prohibits
the
whites
either.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there's
nothing
that
prohibits
the
whites
either
as
i've
undertaken
to
say
your
honor
that
virginia
statute
deals
with
virginia
situation.
the
western
statutes
whereas
their
aspiration
or
classification
of
a
statement
maybe
one-third
caucasian,
one-third
negro
and
one-third
oriental,
those
statutes
deal
with
that
problem.
but
virginia
problem
is
not
presented
--
it
does
not
present
any
question
of
any
social
evil
with
which
the
legislatures
required
to
deal
resulting
from
interracial
marriage
between
negroes
and
malays
or
whites
and
malays
because
there
is
no
significant
population
distribution
to
that
extent
in
virginia.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
not
so.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
because
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
sort
of
racial
composition
your
honor
which
constitutes
less
than
one-fourth
of
1%
does
not
present
the
probability
of
sufficient
interracial
marriages
and
sufficient
difficulty
for
the
legislature
to
be
required
to
deal
with.
the
legislature
in
this
statute
has
covered
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
isn't
the
amount
of
saying
that
they
have
no
rights,
your
honor.
it's
a
matter
of
saying
that
they
--
they
do
not
present
a
problem.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
simply
say
that
in
virginia
those
--
that
segment
of
the
population
is
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
it
does
not
present
a
problem,
which
we
are
required
to
deal.
the
justification
for
these
statutes
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and
on
that
point,
we
have
said
that
a
--
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
a
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
does
not
reach
every
facet
of
the
evil
with
which
it
might
conceivably
deal.
suppose
in
virginia
there
were
no
japanese,
would
a
statute
beyond
constitutionals
--
suppose
that
virginia's
population
was
entirely
100%
white
or
colored
in
any
proportion
you
want,
but
there
was
no
japanese
in
virginia,
would
a
statute,
which
did
not
undertake
to
regulate
marriages
between
mongols
or
malays
or
japanese
beyond
constitutional,
simply
because
it
didn't
regulate
a
relationship
which
doesn't
even
exist
under
virginia
law?
now,
the
fact
that
there
are
only
few
who
does
not,
you
cannot
inflate
this
minority
group
into
constitutional
significance
when
you're
talking
about
the
legislature
dealing
with
the
problems
with
which
is
it
likely
to
be
faced.
the
statute
doesn't
have
to
apply
with
mathematical
(inaudible).
it
is
sufficient
if
it
reasonably
deals
with
what
the
legislature
can
reasonably
apprehend
to
be
an
evil
and
with
99%
of
the
population
in
virginia,
in
one
of
these
two
races,
the
danger
of
interracial
marriages
so
far
as
virginia
is
concerned
is
the
danger
of
marriage
between
white
and
colored,
not
the
danger
of
marriage
of
either
the
white
or
the
colored
with
racist,
which
all
intents
and
purposes
hardly
exist,
as
one
of
the
text
writers
which
they
have
cited
in
their
brief.
mr.
applebaum
in
a
previous
entitled
miscegenation
statute
is
a
constitutional
and
social
problem
which
is
probably
the
most
balanced
analysis
of
these
statutes
that
we
have
found
says
this,
“coverage
of
other
races
in
the
southeast
hardly
necessary
since
they
casually
exist”
and
surely
this
is
true
under
equal
protection
clause.
the
legislature
of
virginia
is
not
required
to
foresee
that
someday
there'll
be
in
virginia
a
significant
population
of
another
racial
group
which
may
require
virginia
to
deal
with
that
problem.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
in
the
south
generally,
yes,
more
in
the
midwest
i
think.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
very
--
very
few
in
virginia.
as
i
said,
the
statistic
show
that
all
other
races
combined,
outside
of
white
and
negro,
constitute
less
than
25,
100
of
1%
of
virginia's
population,
according
to
the
1960
census
and
those
figures
have
not
varied
more
than
1%
or
2%
from
the
1950
population
figures.
so
that
the
problem
of
other
types
of
interracial
marriages,
which
cause
the
interracial
marriage
statutes
of
western
states
to
considerably
oriental
problem
just
simply
doesn't
exist
in
virginia.
now
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
see
how
we
would,
your
honor.
i
mean
they
had
the
--
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
there
is
no
prohibition
against
whites
or
negroes
marrying
any
other
races.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
not
under
this
statute.
there
is
just
no
prohibition
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
they
do
your
honor
because
they
insist
on
dragging
into
this
case,
statutes,
which
are
not
here
and
which
they
can
easily
attack.
i
mean
it's
well-known
strategy
to
attack
the
easy
statute
which
is
simply
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
white
and
colored
--
white
and
colored
that's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
colored
people
are
defined
in
virginia's
statute
the
same
way
define
by
the
united
states
department
of
census
your
honor.
those
people
who
have
negro
blood
or
had
any
mixed
negro
blood
are
considered
to
be
colored
people.
the
virginia
statute
says
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
that's
20-54
again.
that's
the
statute
with
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
because
the
two
statutes,
which
you
have
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor,
were
originally
started
as
a
prototype
in
1691
and
they
have
been
on
the
virginia
books
for
more
than
two
centuries.
the
law
to
which
they
refer,
the
law
of
ruling
out
of
what
they
call
the
hysteria
of
the
1920s
is
an
entirely
separate
law
which
was
designed
to
preserve
the
purity
of
the
white
race.
it
is
a
statute,
which
is
not
before
this
court,
and
a
statute,
which
we
are
not
defending.
the
statute
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
the
virginia
courts
have
not.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
they
can
be
separated
your
honor
because
the
fact
that
historically
and
in
their
coverage
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
they
are
different.
the
act
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
statute
before
your
honors
is
of
that
nature
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
the
two
groups,
but
the
statute
that
which
they
refer
which
had
not
mentioned
in
the
virginia
opinion,
which
has
never
been
applied
to
them
and
which
is
not
now
applied
to
them
and
which
this
court
we
respectfully
submit
cannot
possibly
reach
is
a
statute
which
forbids
a
white
person
to
marry
any
other
than
a
white
person.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
forbid
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
a
white
person
and
a
colored
person
who
married
in
new
york
and
moved
to
virginia
to
live
under
that
statute
would
not
be
able
--
their
marriage
would
not
be
recognized
in
virginia
under
that
statute
or
under
this
statute.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
under
virginia
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
well,
either
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
fornication.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
either
should
go
have
it
or
either
should
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
the
marriage
you
see
if
it
were
between
residents
of
new
york
would
not
offend
either
of
these
statutes
at
all.
it
would
be
a
felony
if
they
were
virginia
residents
and
that
state
for
that
purpose.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
divorce
or
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir
because
virginia
would
not
recognize
the
marriage
as
void
and
the
offense
there
would
probably
be
the
same
type
of
offense
that
this
court
considered
in
mclaughlin
against
florida
and
namely
illicit
cohabitation,
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
if
they
came
to
virginia,
they
would
be
guilty
of
a
felony.
only
those
citizens
of
virginia
who
purport
to
engage
in
a
miscegenation
marriage
or
who
leave
the
state
and
go
to
another
state
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
virginia
to
evade
the
law
are
guilty
of
a
felony.
the
legal
consequences
would
flow
--
which
would
flow
from
the
position
you
put,
would
be
that
virginia
would
not
recognize
this
couple
as
being
married
at
all.
they
would
not
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
therefore,
they
would
fall
under
the
misdemeanor
statute,
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
forbidding
illicit
cohabitation
not
under
this
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
would
be
criminal,
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
that's
the
florida
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
--
that
is
the
florida
case,
which
was
considered.
in
virginia
the
law
is
just
a
simple
non-racial
elicit
cohabitation
statute.
in
the
brief
on
behalf
of
appellants,
with
this
i
will
move
to
a
conclusion,
an
article
is
cited
which
is
i
say
we
think
it
to
be
the
best
balance
of
the
authorities
investigating
this
problem.
i
suppose
that
in
reading
from
it,
i
can
summarize
best
the
results
of
an
investigation
of
the
materials,
which
are
available,
and
the
characterization
of
those
materials.
the
author
of
that
article
says
this,
"reference
to
scientific
and
sociological
evidence
of
the
undesirability
of
amalgamation
is
frequently
made
but
the
courts
have
rarely
examined
any
of
this
evidence.”
the
california
court
in
perez
made
the
first
real
inquiry
into
the
evidence
and
found
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
refuted
the
view
that
the
negro
race
or
the
progeny
of
interracial
marriage
is
inferior.
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
article
to
reach
any
conclusion
regarding
the
available
scientific
data
on
the
results
of
miscegenation.
it
will
suffice
to
indicate
by
a
brief
survey
of
the
materials
that
there
are
may
arguably
be
sufficient
evidence
on
both
sides
of
the
controversy
to
afford
some
basis
for
a
legislature
to
take
either
side.
he
goes
on,
a
large
number
of
studies
and
research
projects
have
concluded
that
miscegenation
is
undesirable.
he
points
out
that
justice
shenk
dissenting
in
perez
cited
10
authorities,
one
of
which
itself
cited
10
additional
authorities
which
would
support
a
legislative
finding
that
amalgamation
of
the
races
is
inimical
to
the
public
welfare.
he
says
that
these
studies
were
frequently
made
by
notable
scientists
and
it
reached
that
conclusion.
he
then
goes
on
and
says
the
authorities'
finding
that
interracial,
intermixture
has
no
harmful
effects
are
also
quite
numerous
and
he
considers
that
authorities
available
on
that
point,
including
the
unesco
statement
and
he
concluded,
“nonetheless,
there
is
still
a
considerable
debate
in
comparatively
recent
studies
as
the
desirability
of
racial
intermixture.
thus,
even
today,
a
legislature
can
find
some
scientific
support
for
the
position
that
miscegenation
should
be
banned.”
he
then
goes
on
to
say
that
of
course
the
sociological
evidence
is
even
more
persuasive
in
support
of
a
policy
against
miscegenation.
and
in
the
later
portion
of
the
article,
he
takes
the
position
that
even
if
the
presumption
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
should
be
reversed
and
the
state
were
required
to
carry
the
burden
of
justifying
the
statute
as
a
piece
of
social
legislation,
he
says
that
the
social
harm
argument
would
present
a
closer
case.
he
said,
“but
again,
it
is
not
likely
that
the
state
could
prove
that
the
social
difficulties
of
the
children
of
miscegenous
couples
are
exceptional
enough
to
overcome
a
presumption
against
racial
categorization.”
he
is
assuming
here
that
the
presumption
is
against
the
state.
concrete
evidence
of
the
effect
upon
such
children
would
be
difficult
to
obtain
particular
since
miscegenation
is
not
widespread.
the
state
then
could
not
present
any
definite
estimate
of
the
potential
of
the
evil
it
is
attempting
to
prevent.
a
state
might
produce
a
strong
case
by
investing
in
research,
but
that
would
involve
considerable
time
and
expense.
now
of
course,
we
say
it
involves
no
time
and
the
expense
is
simply
an
expenditure
of
$10.
the
study
which
he
is
suggesting
could
be
made
to
--
to
unable
the
state
to
carry
the
burden
of
justifying
the
statute
even
if
the
burden
were
upon
the
state
as
already
been
made
and
it
was
rolling
off
the
presses
even
as
mr.
applebaum
wrote
this
order.
there
is
no
reference
in
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
he
indeed
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
on
both
sides
of
the
question,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
he
argues
both
sides
of
the
question.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
gentleman
in
question
is
a
member
of
bar
of
the
district
of
columbia,
an
associate
of
covington-burling
in
washington,
b.a.
of
from
yale
university
and
an
ll.b
of
the
harvard
law
school.
he
concludes
or
i
would
assume
he
concludes
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
reverse
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
legislation
to
be
a
presumption
against
the
legislation
for
these
statutes
to
be
declared
unconstitutional.
if
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
legislation
is
permitted
to
prevail,
then
there
is
arguable
evidence
on
both
sides
of
this
question
and
the
court
is
not
justified
in
overturning
the
legislative
determination
on
this
point.
if
the
presumption
is
against
us,
we
say
that
despite
the
fact
that
this
article
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
state
couldn't
carry
the
burden,
he
said
the
particular
difficulty
would
be
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
a
sociological
nature
which
we
say
is
now
at
hand
and
which
clearly
shows
that
the
state
has
a
justifiable
and
overriding
interest
in
preventing
interracial
marriages.
of
course,
we
go
fundamentally
to
the
proposition
that
for
over
hundred
years
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
numerous
states
as
late
as
1956
the
majority
of
the
states
and
now
even
16
states
have
been
exercising
this
power
without
any
question
being
raised
as
to
the
authority
of
the
states
to
exercise
this
power.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
just
a
number
of
them
are
not
your
honor,
most
of
them
--
most
of
them
are
(voice
overlap)
states.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
your
honor
is
now
asked
me
a
question,
i
am
not
sure
by
states
that
had
miscegenation
laws.
i
can
give
your
honor
the
states
which
now,
the
16
states
which
have
these
laws
on
their
--
on
their
books
at
the
present
time.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but,
i
do
not
have
available
of
the
--
the
states
which
had
antimiscegenation,
i
mean,
the
school
segregation
statutes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
in
missouri,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
it
may
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
oklahoman
is
the
border
state
and
--
it
had
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
of
course
say
that
there
were
30
states
in
1950
which
had
these
statutes
and
those
days
included
the
number
of
the
western
states,
wyoming,
california
and
washington
in
1950
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
(voice
overlap)
they
repealed
that
statute,
as
maryland
had
repealed.
and
we
say
that
this
would
indicate
to
us
that
this
problem
is
one
which
should
be
left
to
the
legislature.
some
states,
each
individual
state
has
the
right
to
make
this
determination
for
itself
because
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
was
intended
to
leave
the
problem
there.
the
judicial
decisions
contemporaneous
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
all
of
the
decisions
with
exception
to
perez
case
since
that
time
has
confirmed
the
common
understanding
of
everyone
that
these
statues
were
not
within
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
say
it
is
unlikely
that
judges
from
all
the
states
and
from
both
judiciaries
could
have
for
so
long
a
period
of
time
acted
in
disregard
the
provisions
or
the
constitution
or
in
any
ignorance
of
what
its
provisions
were
intended
to
accomplish.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
rationalize
a
decision
upholding
this
statute
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
i
would
say
that
brown
against
the
board
of
education
proceeded
upon
the
premise
that
education
was
fundamental
to
good
citizenship
that
it
was
a
necessary
requirement
of
good
citizenship
that
all
children
were
in
the
modern
age
required
to
be
educated
and
that
the
right
to
be
educated
in
this
present
today
world
was
one
of
overriding
importance
and
that
right
could
not
be
infringed
by
statute
which
the
court
found
made
the
educational
opportunities
inherently
unequal
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
would
say
that
the
right
to
marry
if
i
was
rationalizing
a
decision
upholding
it
would
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
meyer
against
nebraska
and
pierce
against
society
of
sisters
and
skinner
against
oklahoma,
but
also
say
that
the
right
to
marry
is
a
right
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
people
marry
and
therefore,
a
statute
which
forbids
marriage
is
not
the
same
as
forbidding
children
to
receive
education.
now
if
you're
going
--
if
you
say
a
decision
is
going
to
uphold
the
statute
then
you
just
naturally
flow
from
the
fact
that
marriage
is
a
right
that
it
cannot
be
arbitrarily
infringed.
then
if
you
make
the
statement
that
any
racial
classification
necessarily
infringes
the
right,
then
you
have
a
decision
of
course
would
be
consistent
with
brown
against
board
of
education,
if
you
take
that
view.
but
in
that
case,
you
do
not
come
to
the
proposition
of
the
power
of
the
state
to
forbid
interracial
marriages
and
the
interest
of
the
state
in
doing
so
on
the
basis
of
the
valid
scientific
evidence
that
exists
on
the
detrimental
effects
of
interracial
marriage.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
start
with
the
right
and
come
to
the
proposition
that
the
state
statute
infringes
the
right
unless
you
exclude
the
evidence
which
tends
to
show
that
the
statute
in
question
is
rational
because
even
rights,
a
right
to
marry
is
subjective
to
reasonable
limitations
by
the
state
as
always
been.
polygamy
statutes
have
never
been
questioned.
incest
statutes
have
never
been
questioned.
they
have
in
fact
been
specifically
upheld
and
upheld
against
the
charge
in
reynolds
against
the
united
states
that
the
person
convicted
there
had
religious
duty
to
marry,
not
to
the
other
right
to
marry,
his
religious
tenet
as
a
mormon
required
him
to
marry.
and
this
court
held
that
the
fact
that
its
religious
tenet
required
him
to
do
so,
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
convicted
criminally
about
engaging
in
a
polygamous
marriage.
so
you
can't
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
infringes,
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
examining
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
show
that
the
infringement
is
a
reasonable
one,
just
as
reasonable
as
far
as
we
can
determine,
as
far
more
evidence
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
ban
against
interracial
marriage
than
there
is
against
polygamous
or
incest
marriages
so
far
as
the
scientific
proposition
is
concern.
but
i
cannot
conceive
to
this
court
striking
down
the
polygamy
or
incest
statute
on
the
basis
of
scientific
evidence,
and
i
submit
that
it
would
be
no
more
appropriate
for
this
court
to
invalidate
the
miscegenetic
statute
on
that
basis.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
it
is.
but
it
has
been
made
in
a
context
in
which
the
evidence
in
support
of
a
proposition
is
existing
evidence
which
is
voluminous
in
its
character
and
which
supports
the
view
not
of
racial
superiority
or
inferiority,
but
a
simple
matter
of
difference
that
the
difference
is
such
that
the
progeny
of
the
intermarried
are
harmed
by
it
and
that
the
divorce
rate
arises
from
the
difference,
not
from
the
inferiority
or
superiority
of
either
race.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
i
appear
as
one
of
counsel
for
the
appellee
in
support
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
our
state
affirming
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
two
statutes
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
in
view
of
what
has
been
said
before,
it
may
not
be
inappropriate
at
this
point
to
emphasize
that
there
are
only
two
statutes
before
this
court
for
consideration,
section
20-58
and
20-59
of
the
virginia
code.
these
statutes
in
their
combined
effect,
prohibit
white
people
from
marrying
colored
people
and
colored
people
from
marrying
white
people
under
the
same
penal
section
and
forbids
citizens
of
virginia
of
either
race
from
leaving
the
state
with
intent
and
purpose
of
evading
this
law.
no
other
statutes
are
involved
in
this
case.
no
attempt
has
been
made
by
any
virginia
officials
to
apply
any
other
statute
to
the
marital
relationship
before
this
court.
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
can
be
read
from
beginning
to
end
without
finding
any
other
statute
mentioned
in
it
except
20-58
and
20-59
with
the
exception
of
that
one
provision
which
relates
to
the
power
of
court
to
suspend
the
execution
of
sentence
upon
which
ground
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
referred
this
case
back
to
the
lower
court
to
have
a
new
condition
of
suspension
imposed.
with
that
exception,
only
two
provisions
of
the
virginia
code
are
mentioned.
therefore,
we
take
the
position
that
these
are
the
only
statutes
before
the
court
and
anything
that
may
have
to
do
with
any
other
provision
of
the
virginia
code
which
imposes
a
prohibition
on
the
white
race
only
or
has
to
do
with
certificates
of
racial
composition,
whatever
they
may
be,
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
this
is
a
statute
which
applies
to
a
virginia
situation
and
forbids
the
intermarriage
of
the
white
and
colored
races.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
would
only
be
significant
mr.
chief
justice
with
respect
to
that
provision
20-54
which
is
not
before
the
court
which
says
that
a
white
person
shall
not
marry
any
other
save
a
white
person
or
a
person
having
no
other
admixture
of
blood
and
white
and
american-indian.
that
is
a
special
statute.
that
is
the
20-54
statute
against
which
i
myself
could
find
a
number
of
constitutional
objections
perhaps
in
that
it
imposes
a
restriction
upon
one
race
alone
which
it
does
not
oppose
on
the
other
races
and
therefore,
more
stringently
curtails
the
rights
of
one
racial
group.
but
so
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
this
is
because
in
virginia,
we
have
only
two
races
of
people
which
are
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
state
of
virginia
in
sufficient
numbers
to
constitute
a
classification
with
which
the
legislature
must
deal.
that
is
why
i
say
the
white
and
the
colored
prohibition
here
completely
controls
the
racial
picture
with
which
virginia
is
faced.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
we
have
indians
your
honor,
but
this
is
the
point
that
we
make
with
respect
to
them.
under
the
census
figures
of
1960,
79
and
some
odds
hundreds
percent
of
the
virginia
population
was
made
up
of
white
people,
20
and
some
odd
hundred
percent
of
the
virginia
population
was
made
up
of
colored
people,
whites
and
negroes
by
definition
of
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
bureau
of
the
census.
thus,
99
and
44
one
hundredths
percent
of
the
virginia
population
falls
into
these
two
racial
categories.
all
other
racial
classes
in
virginia
combined
do
not
constitute
as
much
as
one-fourth
of
1%
of
the
virginia
population.
therefore,
we
say
that
this
problem
of
the
intermarriage
of
whites
and
orientals
or
negroes
and
orientals
or
any
of
these
two
classes
with
polynesians
or
indians
or
asiatic
indians
is
not
a
problem
with
which
virginia
has
faced
and
one
which
is
not
required
to
adopt
its
policy
forbidding
interracial
marriage
too.
a
statute
of
course
does
not
have
to
apply
with
mathematical
precision,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
virginia
population,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
statute
before
the
court
in
this
case
does
apply
almost
with
mathematical
precision
since
it
covers
all
the
dangers
which
virginia
has
a
right
to
apprehend
from
interracial
marriage
in
that
it
prohibits
the
intermarriage
of
those
two
groups
which
constitute
more
than
99%
of
the
virginia
population.
now,
so
far
as
the
particular
appellants
in
this
case
are
concerned,
there
is
no
question
of
constitutional
vagueness
or
doubtful
definition.
it
is
a
matter
of
record,
agreed
to
by
all
counsel
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
and
in
the
brief
that
one
of
the
appellants
here
is
a
white
person
within
the
definition
of
the
virginia
law,
the
other
appellant
is
a
colored
person
within
the
definition
of
virginia
law.
thus,
the
court
is
simply
faced
with
the
proposition
of
whether
or
not
a
state
may
validly
forbid
the
interracial
marriage
of
two
groups,
the
white
and
the
colored
in
the
context
of
the
present
statute.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
we
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
marriage
would
be
recognized
as
valid
in
virginia
even
though
it
was
contracted
by
parties
who
are
not
residents
of
the
state
of
virginia
under
the
conflict
of
laws
principle
that
a
marriage
valid
were
celebrated
is
valid
everywhere.
this
would
be
a
serious
question
and
under
virginia
law,
it
is
highly
questionable
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
recognized
in
virginia,
especially
since
virginia
has
a
very
strong
policy
against
interracial
marriage
and
the
implementing
statutes
declare
that
marriages
between
white
and
colored
people
shall
be
absolutely
void
without
decree
of
divorce
or
other
legal
process,
the
implementing
statute
which
forbids
virginia
citizens
to
leave
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
law
and
returning,
the
exception
to
the
conflict
of
laws
principally
i've
stated
that
a
marriage
valid
was
celebrated
would
be
valid
everywhere
except
where
contrary
to
the
long
--
to
the
strong
local
public
policy.
the
virginia
statute
here
involved
thus
expresses
a
strong
local
public
policy
against
the
intermarriage
of
white
and
colored
people.
now,
with
respect
to
any
other
interracial
marriage,
this
--
the
policy
of
the
virginia
statutes
here
involved
does
not
express
any
sentiment
at
all.
and
we
do
not
have
any
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
mr.
justice
harlan
which
would
shed
light
on
that
proposition
insofar
as
other
races
are
concerned.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
the
--
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
would.
i
do
not
know
whether
virginia
is
--
or
any
state
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
is
requires
to
recognize
a
marriage
which
is
contrary
to
its
own
law,
especially
with
respect
to
matters
within
its
own
state.
now,
the
appellants
of
course
have
asserted
that
the
virginia
statute
here
under
attack
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
assert
that
it
is
not,
and
we
do
so
on
a
basis
of
to
contentions
and
two
contentions
only.
the
first
contention
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
viewed
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
has
no
effect,
whatever
upon
the
power
of
states
to
enact
antimiscegenation
laws
specifically,
antimiscegenation
laws
forbidding
the
intermarriage
of
white
and
colored
persons
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
court
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
authorized
to
infringe
the
power
of
the
state.
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
read
in
the
life
of
its
history,
touch
much
less
diminished
the
power
of
a
states
in
this
regard.
the
second
contention,
an
alternative
contention
is,
that
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
be
deemed
to
apply
to
state
antimiscegenation
statutes,
then
these
statutes
serve
a
legitimate,
legislative
objective
of
preventing
a
sociological,
psychological
evils
which
attend
interracial
marriages,
and
is
a
--
an
expression,
a
rational
expression
of
a
policy
which
virginia
has
a
right
to
adopt.
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
is
concerned,
we
do
not
understand
that
this
court
has
ever
avowed
in
principle,
the
proposition,
that
it
is
necessary
in
construing
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
give
effect
to
the
intention
of
the
framers.
with
respect
to
the
instant
situation,
you
are
not
presented
with
any
question
involving
a
dubious
application
of
certain
principles
to
a
situation
which
was
unforeseen
or
unknown
to
those
who
framed
the
principles.
the
precise
question
before
this
court
today,
the
validity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
a
statute
forbidding
the
marriage
of
whites
and
negroes
was
precisely
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
100
years
ago
when
it
adopted
the
amendment.
the
situation
is
perfectly
clear
that
those
who
considered
the
amendment
against
a
charge
of
infringing
state
power
to
forbid
white
and
colored
marriages,
specifically
excluding
that
power
from
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
your
honor.
we
get
it
from
the
--
specifically
from
the
debates
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
get
it
specifically
your
honor,
from
the
debates
leading
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
debates
on
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
construed
by
members
of
this
court
a
number
of
times
in
its
historical
setting.
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
instances
that
the
specific
debates
on
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
which
act
ultimately
became
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
the
most
material
relating
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
in
this
situation,
by
the
time
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
had
been
debated
and
passed,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
--
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
would
infringe
the
power
of
the
states
to
pass
antimiscegenation
statutes
was
so
completely
settled,
that
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
resolution
was
brought
on,
the
question
was
no
longer
considered
to
be
in
open
one.
the
dissent
on
our
brief
and
pointed
out
by
the
adversaries
that
we
take
the
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
in
part
to
place
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
in
the
constitution
beyond
the
reach
of
shifting
congressional
majority.
we
say
in
part
only
because
as
mr.
justice
black
has
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
adamson
case,
there
were
a
number
of
reasons
why
people
thought
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
included.
some
people
thought
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
was
absolutely
unconstitutional
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
pass
an
amendment
to
validate
it.
others
thought
that
the
act
was
perfectly
constitutional
but
that
it
could
be
repealed
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
place
it
in
the
constitution
to
keep
it
from
being
repealed.
still,
others
thought
that
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
nothing
but
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866
in
another
shape.
nobody
suggested
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
its
adoption
into
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
expanded
the
rights
which
were
covered
in
the
1866
bill.
and
certainly
no
one
suggested
that
what
was
expressly
removed
from
the
1866
act
was
reinserted
in
the
constitution
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
within
a
period
of
just
a
few
months.
now,
the
debates
on
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
clearly
show
that
the
proponents,
those
who
had
the
billion
charge,
those
who
were
instrumental
in
passing
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clearly
in
answer
to
questions
put
by
their
adversaries
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
bill
had
no
application
to
the
states'
power
to
forbid
marriages
between
white
and
colored
persons,
not
simply
amalgamation
but
specifically
between
white
and
colored
persons.
this
was
repeatedly
stated
by
senator
trumbull
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
who
steered
the
bill
to
the
passage
and
was
instrumental
in
passing
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
senator
william
pitt
fessenden
of
maine,
who
was
the
leading
republican
member
on
the
joint
committee
of
reconstruction
of
fifteen,
and
by
various
other
members
who
supported
the
bill,
and
steered
it
to
passage.
now,
text
writers
have
disagreed
as
to
whether
or
not
the
charge
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
would
invalidate
state
laws
was
seriously
made
or
whether
it
was
made
for
political
purposes
simply
as
a
smoke
screen.
regardless
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
made,
the
historical
fact
remains
that
the
challenge
was
put
by
those
who
disagreed
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
that
it
would
affect
the
power
of
the
states
to
pass
antimiscegenation
statutes,
and
the
proponents
and
the
managers
who
had
the
bill
in
charge
absolutely
denied
that
it
would
have
any
such
effect.
no
one
who
voted
for
sponsored
or
espoused
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
dared
to
suggest
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
invalidating
state
antimiscegenation
statutes.
plus,
we
have
a
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
those
who
framed
and
adopted
the
amendment
to
exclude
this
area
of
state
power
from
the
reach
of
the
amendment.
and
this
history
is
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
the
state
legislatures,
which
ratified
the
amendment,
clearly
did
not
understand
that
it
would
have
any
effect
at
all
upon
their
power
to
pass
antimiscegenation
statutes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir,
we
do
not.
we
simply
say
that
it
relates
to
a
statute
which
is
above
and
beyond
or
extraneous
to
the
interracial
marriage
statutes
specifically
left
this
question
open
for
future
decision
and
the
question
left
open
in
mclaughlin
is
now
here.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
do
not
think
they
take
any
comfort
from
mclaughlin
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor.
they
take
comfort
of
course
from
the
dicta
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
make
the
criminal
act
turn
upon
the
color
of
the
skin
of
the
individual
and
if
that
dicta
for
stands
unchallenged,
they
have
reason
to
take
out
--
proponent
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
it
has
nothing
[laughter]
to
do
with
the
fourth
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
nor
do
i
understand
it
in
mclaughlin
that
the
court
considered
this
point.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir
but
we
could
--
we
do
not
put
forward
the
proposition
but
the
pace
case
does
justify
the
statute.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
mean,
so
if
they
want
to
take
comfort
in
that,
that's
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
let
them
be
our
guests.
we
simply
say
that
the
power
of
the
state
to
forbid
interracial
marriages,
if
we
get
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment,
can
be
justified
on
other
grounds.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
our
basic
position.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
legislative
history?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
legislative
history
would
support
the
proposition
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
lewd
and
lascivious
cohabitation
and
so
forth.
my
legislative
history
or
the
legislative
history
which
we
are
set
out
specifically
relates
to
interracial
marriage.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
would
like
to
point
out
one
fact
which
--
or
one
circumstance
which
we
think
is
analogous.
perhaps,
the
most
far
reaching
decision
of
this
court,
so
far
as
the
popular
mind
is
concerned
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
century
has
been
brown
against
board
of
education.
in
that
case,
the
matter
was
argued
in
1952
and
in
1953,
this
court
restored
the
case
to
docket
for
re-argument
and
entered
an
order
in
which
it
had
called
the
attention
of
all
counsel
in
that
case
to
certain
matters
which
the
court
en
banc
wished
to
have
counsel
consider.
the
first
of
these
questions
was,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
court's
order,
"what
evidence
is
there
that
the
congress
which
submitted,
and
the
state
legislatures,
and
conventions
which
ratified
the
fourteenth
amendment
contemplated
or
did
not
contemplate,
understood
or
did
not
understand
that
it
would
abolish
segregation
in
public
schools?"
now,
of
course
it
cannot
be
--
no
presumption
can
be
indulged
that
--
that
question
was
put
to
the
eminent
counsel
in
that
case
simply
as
an
academic
exercise.
the
matter
was
material
to
this
court
to
determine
what
the
evidence
was
with
respect
to
the
intention
of
those
who
adopted
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
legislatures
which
ratified
it.
it
was
material
to
the
proper
disposition
of
that
case.
and
in
response
to
that
question,
on
behalf
of
south
carolina,
mr.
john
w.
davis
filed
a
brief
in
excess
of
150
pages
and
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
the
former
attorney
general
of
virginia
and
private
counsel
filed
another
brief
in
excess
of
150
pages
on
that
point.
the
current
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states,
on
behalf
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people,
mr.
thurgood
marshall,
also
filed
a
brief
of
a
similar
length
in
which
both
sides
of
this
question
was
presented
to
this
court.
in
view
of
the
conflict
which
the
court
found
out
the
result,
the
court
said
that
the
legislative
history
on
this
point
was
unclear.
now,
that
proposition
cannot
arise
in
this
case
because
the
legislative
history
on
this
point
is
all
one
way.
no
one
has
been
found
who
has
analyzed
this
problem,
who
has
suggested
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
understanding
of
the
legislatures
which
ratified
it
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
affected
to
any
degree
the
power
of
the
states
to
forbid
the
intermarriage
of
white
and
colored
citizens.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
the
proponents
in
saying
that
he
did
not
cover,
the
bases
placed
were
two.
one,
that
if
the
statute
equally
forbadee
the
white
race
to
marry
the
colored
race
and
the
colored
race
to
marry
the
white
race
then
in
the
opinion
of
the
framers
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection
or
due
process.
in
other
words,
the
classification
itself
was
not
a
violation.
second
was
that
historically,
the
regulation
of
marital
relationship
was
within
the
states
and
it
was
no
intent
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
have
any
effect
at
all
upon
the
states'
power
over
marriage.
these
were
two
bases.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
has
no
effect
on
the
intention
of
the
framers,
the
fact
was
it
has
not
sustained
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
how
can
a
subsequent
difference
in
approach
of
this
court
after
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
dead
and
buried
possibly
have
any
effect
upon
what
they
intended
when
they
wrote
this
language?
now,
under
this,
the
language
which
they
used
in
saying
that
it
had
no
relate
--
had
no
effect
upon
the
state's
power
over
marriage,
they
also
said
and
provided
no
discrimination
is
made
by.
it's
clear
under
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
if
a
statute
had
forbade
white
people
to
marry
colored
people
and
then
had
a
different
penalty
proscribed
for
violation
of
that
statute
that
even
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
have
thought
that
that
would
have
been
unconstitutional
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
specifically
designed
to
meet
that
difference
in
penalty
proposition.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
your
honor.
these
--
the
material
which
we
have
set
at
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
absolutely
contemporaneous.
the
fourteenth
amendment
resolution
was
brought
on
for
consideration
in
early
1866
and
it
stayed
in
committee
while
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
were
steered
to
passage.
then
after
they
were
steered
to
passage,
the
debate
began
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
by
the
time
that
began,
this
question
of
whether
or
not
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
had
any
effect
upon
the
power
of
the
states
to
forbid
interracial
marriages
was
so
thoroughly
settled,
that
it
did
not
even
become
an
issue.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
the
act
was
constitutional,
unconstitutional
needed
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
substantiate
it,
but
there's
no
suggestion
ever
made
that
it
expanded
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
our
reading
of
the
legislative
history
is
sufficient
to
lead
us
to
believe
that
if
anybody
had
suggested
that
it
would
have
that
affect,
the
entire
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
have
been
lost.
no
one,
the
proponents
would
never
have
suggested
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
going
to
abolish
the
power
of
the
states
to
forbid
interracial
marriage.
thus
we
say
that
if
the
legislative
history
is
given
effect
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
virginia
cannot
be
held
to
violate
it.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
sum
up
the
argument
which
we
have
made
on
behalf
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
referring
to
a
statement
of
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
recent
case
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach,
two
sentences
which
read
as
follows,
"i
see
no
reason
to
read
into
the
constitution,
meanings
it
did
not
have
when
it
was
adopted
and
which
had
not
been
put
into
it
since.
the
proceedings
of
the
original
constitutional
convention
show
beyond
all
doubt
that
power
to
veto
or
negative
state
laws
were
denied
in
congress."
we
respectfully
assert
that
there
was
no
propriety
in
this
court's
reading
into
the
constitution
meanings
it
did
not
have
when
it
was
adopted
or
expanding
the
reach
of
the
constitution
to
embrace
a
subject
which
was
specifically
excluded
by
the
framers.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that's
reinforced
by
the
legislative
history
and
i
don't
know
exactly
how
to
consider
the
question
aside
from
the
legislative
history,
but
that
is
clearly
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
itself.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
framers
understood
that
in
their
intention,
a
law
which
equally
forbade
the
members
of
one
race
to
marry
members
of
another
race
with
same
penal
sanction
on
both
did
treat
the
individuals
of
both
races
equally.
turning
then
to
our
alternative
argument
which
we
say,
can
only
be
reached
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
ignored
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
deemed
to
reach
the
state
power
to
enact
laws
relating
to
the
marriage
relationship,
we
say
that
the
prevention
of
interracial
marriage
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
state
power.
that
there
is
a
rational
classification,
setting
so
far
as
the
virginia
population
is
concerned,
for
preventing
marriages
between
white
and
colored
people
who
make
up
the
--
almost
the
entirety
of
the
state
population,
and
that
this
is
supported
by
the
prevailing
climate
of
scientific
opinion.
we
take
apart
the
position
that
while
there
is
evidence
on
both
sides
of
this
question,
when
such
a
situation
exist
it
is
for
the
legislature
to
draw
its
conclusions
and
that
these
conclusions
are
entitled
to
wait
and
unless
it
can
be
clearly
said
that
there
is
no
debatable
question
that
a
statute
of
this
type
cannot
be
declared
unconstitutional.
we
start
with
the
proposition,
on
this
connection,
that
it
is
the
family
which
constitutes
the
structural
element
of
society
and
that
marriage
is
the
legal
basis
upon
which
families
are
formed.
consequently,
this
court
has
held,
in
a
numerous
decisions
over
the
years,
that
society
is
structured
on
the
institution
of
marriage
that
it
has
more
to
do
with
a
welfare
and
civilizations
of
the
people
that
any
other
institutions
and
that
out
of
the
fruits
of
marriage
spring
relationships
and
responsibilities
with
which
the
state
is
necessarily
required
the
deal.
text
writers
and
judicial
writers
agree
that
the
state
has
a
natural
direct
and
vital
interest
in
maximizing
the
number
of
successful
marriages,
which
lead
to
stable
homes
and
families
and
in
minimizing
those
which
do
not.
it
is
clear
from
the
most
recent
available
evidence
on
the
psycho-sociological
aspect
of
this
question
that
intermarried
families
are
subjected
to
much
greater
pressures
and
problems
then
those
of
the
intramarried
and
that
the
state's
prohibition
of
interracial
marriage
for
this
reason
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
the
prohibition
of
polygamous
marriage,
or
incestuous
marriage
or
the
prescription
of
minimum
ages
at
which
people
may
marry
and
the
prevention
of
the
marriage
of
people
who
are
mentally
incompetent.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
that
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
prohibition
of
interracial
marriage
is
stronger
than
that
for
the
prohibition
of
interreligious
marriage.
but
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
we
say
that
principally
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
we
say
it
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
authority
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
particularly,
this
one
volume,
which
we
have
cited
from
copiously
in
our
brief
which
is
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
this
is
a
book
by
dr.
albert
i.
gordon,
your
honor,
which
is
characterized
as
the
definitive
book
by
dr.
albert
i.
gordon,
which
is
characterized
as
the
definitive
book
on
intermarriage,
and
has
the
most
careful,
up
to
date,
methodologically
sound
study
of
intermarriage
in
north
america
that
exists.
it
is
entitled
"intermarriage,
interfaith,
interracial,
interethnic."
now,
our
proposition
on
the
psycho-sociological
aspects
of
this
question
is
bottomed
almost
exclusively
on
this
particular
volume.
this
is
the
work
of
a
jewish
rabbi
who
is
also,
has
a
m.a.
in
sociology
and
a
ph.d.
in
social
anthropology.
it
is
a
statistical
study
of
over
5000
marriages
which
was
aided
by
the
computers
of
the
harvard
laboratory
of
social
relations
and
the
mit
computation
center.
this
book
has
been
given
statistical
form
and
basis
to
the
proposition
that
from
the
psycho-sociological
point
of
view,
interracial
marriages
are
detrimental
to
the
individual,
to
the
family,
and
to
society.
i
do
not
say
that
the
author
of
this
book
would
advocate
the
prohibition
of
such
marriages
by
law
but
we
do
say
that
he
personally
and
clearly
expresses
his
view
as
a
social
scientist
that
interracial
marriages
are
definitely
undesirable
that
they
hold
no
promise
for
a
bright
and
happy
future
for
mankind.
and
that
the
interracial
marriages
bequeath
to
the
progeny
of
those
marriages,
more
psychological
problems
than
parents
have
a
right
to
bequeath
to
them.
as
i
say,
this
book
has
been
widely
accepted
and
it
was
published
in
1964
as
being
the
definitive
book
on
intermarriage
in
north
american
that
exists.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
that,
your
honor,
from
any
of
the
two
that
i've
given.
he's
a
rabbi
in
temple
emanuel
in
newton
center,
massachusetts.
i
do
not
understand
that
the
--
and
certainly,
the
religious
view
of
the
orthodox
or
the
conservative
or
the
reformed
jewish
phase
disagree
necessarily
on
this
particular
proposition,
but
i
cannot
say
whether
dr.
gordon
is
orthodox
or
a
reformed
jewish
rabbi.
i
am
more
interested
of
course
in
his
credentials
as
a
scientist
for
this
purpose,
as
a
doctor
of
social
anthropology
and
as
a
sociologist
and
of
course,
i
am
in
his
religious
affiliation.
but
it
is
clear,
unmistakably
clear,
and
we
have
set
it
forth
as
i
say,
in
our
brief
and
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
results
of
the
study
which
has
been
made
and
which
is
embodied
in
this
volume.
as
i
say,
it
was
published
in
1964
and
some
of
the
statements
which
made
in
it
based
upon
the
demonstrably
--
statistically
demonstrably
greater
ratio
of
a
marry
--
of
divorce,
annulment
in
intermarried
couples
than
intramarried
couples.
dr.
gordon
has
stated
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
is
my
conviction
that
intermarriage
is
definitely
inadvisible,
that
they
are
wrong
because
they
are
most
frequently
if
not
solely
entered
into
under
the
present
day
circumstances
by
people
who
have
a
rebellious
attitude
towards
--
towards
society,
self-hatred,
neurotic
tendencies,
immaturity
and
other
detrimental
psychological
factors.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
it
is
more
the
latter,
the
attitudes
that
perhaps
the
laws
reflect.
i
don't
find
anywhere
in
this
that
the
existence
of
law.
it
is
the
attitude
which
society
has
taught
interracial
marriages,
which
in
detailing
his
opposition
says,
"causes
a
child
to
have
almost
insuperable
difficulties
in
identification
and
that
the
problems
which
a
child
of
an
interracial
marriage
faces
are
those
which
no
child
can
come
through
without
damage
to
himself."
now
if
the
state
has
an
interest
in
marriage,
if
it
has
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
number
of
stable
marriages
and
in
protecting
the
progeny
of
interracial
marriages
from
these
problems,
then
clearly,
there
is
scientific
evidence
available
that
this
is
so.
it
is
not
infrequent
that
the
children
of
intermarried
parents
are
referred
to
not
merely
as
the
children
of
intermarried
parents
but
as
the
victims
of
intermarried
parents
and
as
the
martyrs
of
intermarried
parents.
these
are
the
direct
quotes
from
the
volume.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
understand
that
he
does.
all
that
he
purports
to
say
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
biological
difference
is,
this
is
not
his
field,
in
other
words,
genetics
and
biology.
he
reviews
the
materials
on
this
and
concludes
for
the
purpose
of
his
study
that
biologically
and
genetically,
there
is
probably
no
justification
for
the
prevention
of
intermarriage.
then
he
takes
it
further
into
the
psycho-sociological
field
and
its
effect
upon
children
and
upon
the
intermarried
couples
and
this
is
what
his
views
are
based
upon.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
we
take
two
positions
with
respect
to
that.
one
is
that
the
evidence
there
is
negative.
they
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
reliable
evidence
that
there
are
any
harmful
consequences
of
intermarriage.
they
do
not
say
that
the
evidence
shows
conclusively
that
there
are
none.
their
position
in
the
unesco's
statement
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
any
harmful
effect.
that's
the
first
position,
that
it
is
negative
on
this
point.
the
second
position
is
set
out
in
appendix
c
of
our
brief
in
which
the
next
year,
after
the
publication
of
the
unesco's
statement,
unesco
also
published
another
book
entitled
"the
race
concepts"
results
of
an
inquiry
in
which
it
set
forth
the
criticisms
that
had
been
leveled
at
that
statement
by
equally
eminent
anthropologists
and
biologists
with
respect
to
it.
and
we
have
on
page
12
through
22
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
published
extracted
from
the
second
unesco
publication,
a
symposium
of
the
critiques
level
at
the
unesco
statement
as
well
as
other
scientists
who
agreed
with
the
unesco
statement.
so
we
said
that
the
unesco
statement
is
by
no
means
definitive
and
it
is
not
the
statement
which
is
at
all
joined
in
by
the
scientific
community
especially
on
that
point.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
guess
that
they
would
not,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
find
that
on
the
psycho-sociological
aspects
there
is
any
disagreement
with
his
work.
no
one
has
challenged
the
statistics
in
this
work
and
it
has
been
widely
received
as
we
put
--
set
forth
in
our
brief
as
putting
statistical
form
on
an
embarrassing
gap
in
the
literature
of
the
social
sciences.
and
it
has
been
--
as
i
say
received
by
--
not
only
by
scientists
but
by
religious
individuals
as
well.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir,
but
there
is
equally
in
the
second
publication
of
unesco,
there
is
equally
stringent
criticism
of
that
statement
as
being
an
attempt
to
close
a
system
of
knowledge
and
to
state
that
there
is
no
scientific
evidence
the
other
way
when
that
is
simply
not
the
case,
and
the
--
this
material
which
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
if
some
the
second
unesco's
statement.
in
other
words,
unesco
itself
realized
that
its
first
publication
elicited
such
criticism
that
it
felt
down
to
put
this
criticism
as
well
as
other
supplementing
unesco
statement
in
a
second
publication,
which
shows
that
there
is
by
no
means
unanimity
of
agreement
on
this
point.
and
we
have
pointed
out
in
further
appendices
to
our
brief,
the
1964,
the
unesco
statement
of
course
in
1951
and
52,
we
have
pointed
out
the
recent
statements
of
professor
engel,
professor
of
physiology
at
chicago
university
in
which
he
cautions
against
interracial
marriages
on
the
ground,
not
of
any
specific
finding
of
his
own,
but
on
the
grounds
that
there
has
not
been
sufficient
scientific
investigation
of
this
matter
for
a
physiologist
at
least
to
determine
the
true
effects,
physiologically
speaking
of
interracial
marriage
and
cautions
against
it.
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
libraries
are
filled
with
criticizes
and
research
studies
of
the
cautionary
nature
which
advised
against
it
on
a
biological
and
genetic
point
of
view.
a
number
of
these
were
cited
in
perez
against
sharp
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
we
have
updated
them
by
the
citation
of
additional
authorities
most
of
which
were
published
in
the
last
five
years,
which
updates
that
study.
perhaps,
i
can
summarize
this.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
would
your
honor.
i
have
stated
clearly
in
the
brief
that
the
court
to
undertake
to
end
of
this
controversy,
the
court
would
find
itself
admired
in
a
sembonian
bag
of
conflicting
scientific
opinions
which
i
assure
the
court
is
sufficiently
broad,
sufficiently
fluid
and
sufficiently
deep
to
swallow
up
the
entire
federal
judiciary.
if
you
read
one
volume
on
this
point,
you
find
20
additional
authorities
cited
in
that
one
volume
which
you
haven't
read.
by
the
time
you
read
six
articles
on
this
point,
you've
got
a
bibliography
of
a
150
books
on
the
same
subject,
pro
and
con.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
on
these
--
the
two
statutes
before
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
that
is
not
so.
so
far
as
20-54
is
concerned,
the
act
of
virginia
of
1924
to
preserve
racial
purity,
i
think
that
is
unquestionably
true.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor
i
think
that
there
is.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
its
justification
for
saying
that
is
not
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
you
mean
--
i
think
historically
that
the
--
that
the
legislatures
that
which
enacted
them
had
that
thought
in
mind.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
i
think
that
--
that's
clear.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
--
that's
which
the
original
enactments
were
rested.
i
think
that's
perfectly
clear.
but
your
honor
i
say
that
you
are
facing
a
problem
in
1967
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
the
prohibition
your
honor
works
both
ways.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
prohibition
works
both
ways.
you
say
a
man
that
is
prohibited
from
marrying
into
another
race
feels
inferior.
the
prohibition
also
prohibits
the
white
person
to
marry
the
colored
person.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
motivation
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
motivation
of
the
earlier
statutes,
if
you
--
by
motivation
you
undertake
to
analyze
the
feelings
of
the
individual
members
of
the
legislature
that
were
responsible
for
the
adaption
of
the
statutes,
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
see
how
that
can
affect
the
constitutional
problem
which
is
presented
to
this
court
where
an
enactment
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
is
on
trial
in
which
we
submit
was
beyond
the
scope
of
fourteenth
amendment
as
the
first
proposition
and
as
a
second
proposition
even
if
it
wasn't
beyond
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
is
subjected
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
test
it
is
a
justifiable
regulation
in
view
of
today's
evidence
on
the
point.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
don't
have
any
prohibition
against
anyone
in
virginia,
so
far
as
these
statutes
are
concerned
marrying
a
mongolian
or
malay.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
they
are,
your
honor
and
if
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
that
prohibits
the
whites
either.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there's
nothing
that
prohibits
the
whites
either
as
i've
undertaken
to
say
your
honor
that
virginia
statute
deals
with
virginia
situation.
the
western
statutes
whereas
their
aspiration
or
classification
of
a
statement
maybe
one-third
caucasian,
one-third
negro
and
one-third
oriental,
those
statutes
deal
with
that
problem.
but
virginia
problem
is
not
presented
--
it
does
not
present
any
question
of
any
social
evil
with
which
the
legislatures
required
to
deal
resulting
from
interracial
marriage
between
negroes
and
malays
or
whites
and
malays
because
there
is
no
significant
population
distribution
to
that
extent
in
virginia.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
not
so.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
because
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
sort
of
racial
composition
your
honor
which
constitutes
less
than
one-fourth
of
1%
does
not
present
the
probability
of
sufficient
interracial
marriages
and
sufficient
difficulty
for
the
legislature
to
be
required
to
deal
with.
the
legislature
in
this
statute
has
covered
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
isn't
the
amount
of
saying
that
they
have
no
rights,
your
honor.
it's
a
matter
of
saying
that
they
--
they
do
not
present
a
problem.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
simply
say
that
in
virginia
those
--
that
segment
of
the
population
is
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
it
does
not
present
a
problem,
which
we
are
required
to
deal.
the
justification
for
these
statutes
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and
on
that
point,
we
have
said
that
a
--
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
a
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
does
not
reach
every
facet
of
the
evil
with
which
it
might
conceivably
deal.
suppose
in
virginia
there
were
no
japanese,
would
a
statute
beyond
constitutionals
--
suppose
that
virginia's
population
was
entirely
100%
white
or
colored
in
any
proportion
you
want,
but
there
was
no
japanese
in
virginia,
would
a
statute,
which
did
not
undertake
to
regulate
marriages
between
mongols
or
malays
or
japanese
beyond
constitutional,
simply
because
it
didn't
regulate
a
relationship
which
doesn't
even
exist
under
virginia
law?
now,
the
fact
that
there
are
only
few
who
does
not,
you
cannot
inflate
this
minority
group
into
constitutional
significance
when
you're
talking
about
the
legislature
dealing
with
the
problems
with
which
is
it
likely
to
be
faced.
the
statute
doesn't
have
to
apply
with
mathematical
(inaudible).
it
is
sufficient
if
it
reasonably
deals
with
what
the
legislature
can
reasonably
apprehend
to
be
an
evil
and
with
99%
of
the
population
in
virginia,
in
one
of
these
two
races,
the
danger
of
interracial
marriages
so
far
as
virginia
is
concerned
is
the
danger
of
marriage
between
white
and
colored,
not
the
danger
of
marriage
of
either
the
white
or
the
colored
with
racist,
which
all
intents
and
purposes
hardly
exist,
as
one
of
the
text
writers
which
they
have
cited
in
their
brief.
mr.
applebaum
in
a
previous
entitled
miscegenation
statute
is
a
constitutional
and
social
problem
which
is
probably
the
most
balanced
analysis
of
these
statutes
that
we
have
found
says
this,
“coverage
of
other
races
in
the
southeast
hardly
necessary
since
they
casually
exist”
and
surely
this
is
true
under
equal
protection
clause.
the
legislature
of
virginia
is
not
required
to
foresee
that
someday
there'll
be
in
virginia
a
significant
population
of
another
racial
group
which
may
require
virginia
to
deal
with
that
problem.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
in
the
south
generally,
yes,
more
in
the
midwest
i
think.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
very
--
very
few
in
virginia.
as
i
said,
the
statistic
show
that
all
other
races
combined,
outside
of
white
and
negro,
constitute
less
than
25,
100
of
1%
of
virginia's
population,
according
to
the
1960
census
and
those
figures
have
not
varied
more
than
1%
or
2%
from
the
1950
population
figures.
so
that
the
problem
of
other
types
of
interracial
marriages,
which
cause
the
interracial
marriage
statutes
of
western
states
to
considerably
oriental
problem
just
simply
doesn't
exist
in
virginia.
now
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
see
how
we
would,
your
honor.
i
mean
they
had
the
--
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
there
is
no
prohibition
against
whites
or
negroes
marrying
any
other
races.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
not
under
this
statute.
there
is
just
no
prohibition
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
they
do
your
honor
because
they
insist
on
dragging
into
this
case,
statutes,
which
are
not
here
and
which
they
can
easily
attack.
i
mean
it's
well-known
strategy
to
attack
the
easy
statute
which
is
simply
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
white
and
colored
--
white
and
colored
that's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
colored
people
are
defined
in
virginia's
statute
the
same
way
define
by
the
united
states
department
of
census
your
honor.
those
people
who
have
negro
blood
or
had
any
mixed
negro
blood
are
considered
to
be
colored
people.
the
virginia
statute
says
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
that's
20-54
again.
that's
the
statute
with
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
because
the
two
statutes,
which
you
have
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor,
were
originally
started
as
a
prototype
in
1691
and
they
have
been
on
the
virginia
books
for
more
than
two
centuries.
the
law
to
which
they
refer,
the
law
of
ruling
out
of
what
they
call
the
hysteria
of
the
1920s
is
an
entirely
separate
law
which
was
designed
to
preserve
the
purity
of
the
white
race.
it
is
a
statute,
which
is
not
before
this
court,
and
a
statute,
which
we
are
not
defending.
the
statute
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
the
virginia
courts
have
not.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
they
can
be
separated
your
honor
because
the
fact
that
historically
and
in
their
coverage
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
they
are
different.
the
act
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
statute
before
your
honors
is
of
that
nature
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
the
two
groups,
but
the
statute
that
which
they
refer
which
had
not
mentioned
in
the
virginia
opinion,
which
has
never
been
applied
to
them
and
which
is
not
now
applied
to
them
and
which
this
court
we
respectfully
submit
cannot
possibly
reach
is
a
statute
which
forbids
a
white
person
to
marry
any
other
than
a
white
person.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
forbid
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
a
white
person
and
a
colored
person
who
married
in
new
york
and
moved
to
virginia
to
live
under
that
statute
would
not
be
able
--
their
marriage
would
not
be
recognized
in
virginia
under
that
statute
or
under
this
statute.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
under
virginia
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
well,
either
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
fornication.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
either
should
go
have
it
or
either
should
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
the
marriage
you
see
if
it
were
between
residents
of
new
york
would
not
offend
either
of
these
statutes
at
all.
it
would
be
a
felony
if
they
were
virginia
residents
and
that
state
for
that
purpose.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
divorce
or
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir
because
virginia
would
not
recognize
the
marriage
as
void
and
the
offense
there
would
probably
be
the
same
type
of
offense
that
this
court
considered
in
mclaughlin
against
florida
and
namely
illicit
cohabitation,
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
if
they
came
to
virginia,
they
would
be
guilty
of
a
felony.
only
those
citizens
of
virginia
who
purport
to
engage
in
a
miscegenation
marriage
or
who
leave
the
state
and
go
to
another
state
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
virginia
to
evade
the
law
are
guilty
of
a
felony.
the
legal
consequences
would
flow
--
which
would
flow
from
the
position
you
put,
would
be
that
virginia
would
not
recognize
this
couple
as
being
married
at
all.
they
would
not
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
therefore,
they
would
fall
under
the
misdemeanor
statute,
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
forbidding
illicit
cohabitation
not
under
this
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
would
be
criminal,
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
that's
the
florida
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
--
that
is
the
florida
case,
which
was
considered.
in
virginia
the
law
is
just
a
simple
non-racial
elicit
cohabitation
statute.
in
the
brief
on
behalf
of
appellants,
with
this
i
will
move
to
a
conclusion,
an
article
is
cited
which
is
i
say
we
think
it
to
be
the
best
balance
of
the
authorities
investigating
this
problem.
i
suppose
that
in
reading
from
it,
i
can
summarize
best
the
results
of
an
investigation
of
the
materials,
which
are
available,
and
the
characterization
of
those
materials.
the
author
of
that
article
says
this,
"reference
to
scientific
and
sociological
evidence
of
the
undesirability
of
amalgamation
is
frequently
made
but
the
courts
have
rarely
examined
any
of
this
evidence.”
the
california
court
in
perez
made
the
first
real
inquiry
into
the
evidence
and
found
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
refuted
the
view
that
the
negro
race
or
the
progeny
of
interracial
marriage
is
inferior.
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
article
to
reach
any
conclusion
regarding
the
available
scientific
data
on
the
results
of
miscegenation.
it
will
suffice
to
indicate
by
a
brief
survey
of
the
materials
that
there
are
may
arguably
be
sufficient
evidence
on
both
sides
of
the
controversy
to
afford
some
basis
for
a
legislature
to
take
either
side.
he
goes
on,
a
large
number
of
studies
and
research
projects
have
concluded
that
miscegenation
is
undesirable.
he
points
out
that
justice
shenk
dissenting
in
perez
cited
10
authorities,
one
of
which
itself
cited
10
additional
authorities
which
would
support
a
legislative
finding
that
amalgamation
of
the
races
is
inimical
to
the
public
welfare.
he
says
that
these
studies
were
frequently
made
by
notable
scientists
and
it
reached
that
conclusion.
he
then
goes
on
and
says
the
authorities'
finding
that
interracial,
intermixture
has
no
harmful
effects
are
also
quite
numerous
and
he
considers
that
authorities
available
on
that
point,
including
the
unesco
statement
and
he
concluded,
“nonetheless,
there
is
still
a
considerable
debate
in
comparatively
recent
studies
as
the
desirability
of
racial
intermixture.
thus,
even
today,
a
legislature
can
find
some
scientific
support
for
the
position
that
miscegenation
should
be
banned.”
he
then
goes
on
to
say
that
of
course
the
sociological
evidence
is
even
more
persuasive
in
support
of
a
policy
against
miscegenation.
and
in
the
later
portion
of
the
article,
he
takes
the
position
that
even
if
the
presumption
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
should
be
reversed
and
the
state
were
required
to
carry
the
burden
of
justifying
the
statute
as
a
piece
of
social
legislation,
he
says
that
the
social
harm
argument
would
present
a
closer
case.
he
said,
“but
again,
it
is
not
likely
that
the
state
could
prove
that
the
social
difficulties
of
the
children
of
miscegenous
couples
are
exceptional
enough
to
overcome
a
presumption
against
racial
categorization.”
he
is
assuming
here
that
the
presumption
is
against
the
state.
concrete
evidence
of
the
effect
upon
such
children
would
be
difficult
to
obtain
particular
since
miscegenation
is
not
widespread.
the
state
then
could
not
present
any
definite
estimate
of
the
potential
of
the
evil
it
is
attempting
to
prevent.
a
state
might
produce
a
strong
case
by
investing
in
research,
but
that
would
involve
considerable
time
and
expense.
now
of
course,
we
say
it
involves
no
time
and
the
expense
is
simply
an
expenditure
of
$10.
the
study
which
he
is
suggesting
could
be
made
to
--
to
unable
the
state
to
carry
the
burden
of
justifying
the
statute
even
if
the
burden
were
upon
the
state
as
already
been
made
and
it
was
rolling
off
the
presses
even
as
mr.
applebaum
wrote
this
order.
there
is
no
reference
in
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
he
indeed
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
on
both
sides
of
the
question,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
he
argues
both
sides
of
the
question.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
gentleman
in
question
is
a
member
of
bar
of
the
district
of
columbia,
an
associate
of
covington-burling
in
washington,
b.a.
of
from
yale
university
and
an
ll.b
of
the
harvard
law
school.
he
concludes
or
i
would
assume
he
concludes
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
reverse
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
legislation
to
be
a
presumption
against
the
legislation
for
these
statutes
to
be
declared
unconstitutional.
if
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
legislation
is
permitted
to
prevail,
then
there
is
arguable
evidence
on
both
sides
of
this
question
and
the
court
is
not
justified
in
overturning
the
legislative
determination
on
this
point.
if
the
presumption
is
against
us,
we
say
that
despite
the
fact
that
this
article
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
state
couldn't
carry
the
burden,
he
said
the
particular
difficulty
would
be
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
a
sociological
nature
which
we
say
is
now
at
hand
and
which
clearly
shows
that
the
state
has
a
justifiable
and
overriding
interest
in
preventing
interracial
marriages.
of
course,
we
go
fundamentally
to
the
proposition
that
for
over
hundred
years
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
numerous
states
as
late
as
1956
the
majority
of
the
states
and
now
even
16
states
have
been
exercising
this
power
without
any
question
being
raised
as
to
the
authority
of
the
states
to
exercise
this
power.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
just
a
number
of
them
are
not
your
honor,
most
of
them
--
most
of
them
are
(voice
overlap)
states.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
your
honor
is
now
asked
me
a
question,
i
am
not
sure
by
states
that
had
miscegenation
laws.
i
can
give
your
honor
the
states
which
now,
the
16
states
which
have
these
laws
on
their
--
on
their
books
at
the
present
time.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but,
i
do
not
have
available
of
the
--
the
states
which
had
antimiscegenation,
i
mean,
the
school
segregation
statutes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
in
missouri,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
it
may
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
oklahoman
is
the
border
state
and
--
it
had
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
of
course
say
that
there
were
30
states
in
1950
which
had
these
statutes
and
those
days
included
the
number
of
the
western
states,
wyoming,
california
and
washington
in
1950
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
(voice
overlap)
they
repealed
that
statute,
as
maryland
had
repealed.
and
we
say
that
this
would
indicate
to
us
that
this
problem
is
one
which
should
be
left
to
the
legislature.
some
states,
each
individual
state
has
the
right
to
make
this
determination
for
itself
because
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
was
intended
to
leave
the
problem
there.
the
judicial
decisions
contemporaneous
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
all
of
the
decisions
with
exception
to
perez
case
since
that
time
has
confirmed
the
common
understanding
of
everyone
that
these
statues
were
not
within
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
say
it
is
unlikely
that
judges
from
all
the
states
and
from
both
judiciaries
could
have
for
so
long
a
period
of
time
acted
in
disregard
the
provisions
or
the
constitution
or
in
any
ignorance
of
what
its
provisions
were
intended
to
accomplish.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
rationalize
a
decision
upholding
this
statute
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
i
would
say
that
brown
against
the
board
of
education
proceeded
upon
the
premise
that
education
was
fundamental
to
good
citizenship
that
it
was
a
necessary
requirement
of
good
citizenship
that
all
children
were
in
the
modern
age
required
to
be
educated
and
that
the
right
to
be
educated
in
this
present
today
world
was
one
of
overriding
importance
and
that
right
could
not
be
infringed
by
statute
which
the
court
found
made
the
educational
opportunities
inherently
unequal
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
would
say
that
the
right
to
marry
if
i
was
rationalizing
a
decision
upholding
it
would
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
meyer
against
nebraska
and
pierce
against
society
of
sisters
and
skinner
against
oklahoma,
but
also
say
that
the
right
to
marry
is
a
right
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
people
marry
and
therefore,
a
statute
which
forbids
marriage
is
not
the
same
as
forbidding
children
to
receive
education.
now
if
you're
going
--
if
you
say
a
decision
is
going
to
uphold
the
statute
then
you
just
naturally
flow
from
the
fact
that
marriage
is
a
right
that
it
cannot
be
arbitrarily
infringed.
then
if
you
make
the
statement
that
any
racial
classification
necessarily
infringes
the
right,
then
you
have
a
decision
of
course
would
be
consistent
with
brown
against
board
of
education,
if
you
take
that
view.
but
in
that
case,
you
do
not
come
to
the
proposition
of
the
power
of
the
state
to
forbid
interracial
marriages
and
the
interest
of
the
state
in
doing
so
on
the
basis
of
the
valid
scientific
evidence
that
exists
on
the
detrimental
effects
of
interracial
marriage.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
start
with
the
right
and
come
to
the
proposition
that
the
state
statute
infringes
the
right
unless
you
exclude
the
evidence
which
tends
to
show
that
the
statute
in
question
is
rational
because
even
rights,
a
right
to
marry
is
subjective
to
reasonable
limitations
by
the
state
as
always
been.
polygamy
statutes
have
never
been
questioned.
incest
statutes
have
never
been
questioned.
they
have
in
fact
been
specifically
upheld
and
upheld
against
the
charge
in
reynolds
against
the
united
states
that
the
person
convicted
there
had
religious
duty
to
marry,
not
to
the
other
right
to
marry,
his
religious
tenet
as
a
mormon
required
him
to
marry.
and
this
court
held
that
the
fact
that
its
religious
tenet
required
him
to
do
so,
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
convicted
criminally
about
engaging
in
a
polygamous
marriage.
so
you
can't
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
infringes,
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
examining
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
show
that
the
infringement
is
a
reasonable
one,
just
as
reasonable
as
far
as
we
can
determine,
as
far
more
evidence
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
ban
against
interracial
marriage
than
there
is
against
polygamous
or
incest
marriages
so
far
as
the
scientific
proposition
is
concern.
but
i
cannot
conceive
to
this
court
striking
down
the
polygamy
or
incest
statute
on
the
basis
of
scientific
evidence,
and
i
submit
that
it
would
be
no
more
appropriate
for
this
court
to
invalidate
the
miscegenetic
statute
on
that
basis.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
it
is.
but
it
has
been
made
in
a
context
in
which
the
evidence
in
support
of
a
proposition
is
existing
evidence
which
is
voluminous
in
its
character
and
which
supports
the
view
not
of
racial
superiority
or
inferiority,
but
a
simple
matter
of
difference
that
the
difference
is
such
that
the
progeny
of
the
intermarried
are
harmed
by
it
and
that
the
divorce
rate
arises
from
the
difference,
not
from
the
inferiority
or
superiority
of
either
race.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
