mr.
william
m.
marutani
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
marutani,
legal
counsel
for
the
japanese
american
citizens
league
which
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
appeal.
on
behalf
of
the
japanese
american
citizens
league,
i
would
like
to
thank
this
court
for
this
privilege.
because
the
issues
before
this
court
today
revolve
around
the
question
of
race,
may
i
be
excused
in
making
a
brief
personal
reference
in
this
regard?
as
a
nisei,
that
is
american
born
and
raised
in
this
country
but
whose
parents
came
from
japan,
i
am
and
i
say
this
with
some
trepidation
of
being
challenged,
perhaps
among
those
few
in
this
courtroom
along
with
the
few
other
nisei
who
happened
to
be
here
this
morning,
who
can
declare
with
some
degree
of
certainty,
the
verity
of
his
race,
that
is
at
the
term
race
is
--
as
defined
as
an
endogamous
or
inbreeding
geographic
population
group.
this
means
the
broad
definition
of
convenience
utilized
by
anthropologists.
now,
those
who
would
trace
their
ancestry
to
the
european
cultures
where
over
the
centuries,
there
have
been
invasions,
cross-invasions,
population
shifts
with
the
inevitable
cross-breeding
which
follows
and
particularly
those
same
europeans
who
have
been
part
of
the
melting
pot
of
america,
i
suggest
would
have
a
most
difficult,
if
not
impossible
task
of
establishing
what
virginia's
antimiscegenation
statutes
require
namely,
and
i
quote,
proving
that,
"no
trace
whatever
of
any
blood
other
than
caucasian."
this
is
what
virginia
statutes
would
require.
incidentally,
this
presupposes
that
the
term
caucasian
is
susceptible
of
some
meaningful
definition.
a
burden
incidentally
which
virginia's
laws
somehow
conveniently
overlooks,
but
then
this
same
infirmity
applies
to
the
remaining
15
states
which
have
similar
antimiscegenation
laws.
now,
one
of
the
most
sophisticated
anthropologists
with
all
their
specialized
training
and
expertise,
flatly
reject
the
notion
of
any
pure
race
and
in
this
connection.
i
refer
to
the
unesco
proposal,
a
statement
on
race
which
is
attached
to
appendix
a
to
the
amicus
brief,
and
incidentally,
also
signed
by
professor
carleton
coon
who
is
a
very
frequently
cited
by
those
who
would
uphold
racial
differences.
now,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
anthropologists,
reject,
flatly
reject
the
concept
that
any
notion
of
a
pure
race
under
section
20-53
of
virginia's
laws,
that
clerk
or
the
deputy
clerk
is
endowed
with
the
power
to
determine
whether
an
applicant
for
a
marriage
license
is,
"of
pure
white
race,"
a
clerk
or
his
deputy.
moreover,
the
common
law
of
virginia
would
have
layman
as
its
clerks,
judges
and
juries,
take
a
vague
and
scandalous
terms
such
as
colored
person,
white
person,
caucasian
and
apply
them
to
specific
situations
coupled
with
the
power
in
this
layman
to
invoke
civil
and
criminal
sanctions
where
in
their
view
an
interpretation
of
these
terms,
the
laws
of
virginia
had
been
violated.
i
believe
no
citation
is
required
to
state
or
to
conclude
that
this
is
vagueness
in
its
grossest
sense.
i
refer
the
court
again
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania
decided
in
1966
in
which
the
court
stated,
"such
a
law
which
leaves
judges
and
jurors
free
to
decide
without
any
legally
fixed
standards
what
is
prohibited
and
what
is
not
in
each
particular
case
fails
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause.
now,
let
us
assume
arguendo
that
race
--
there
are
such
things
as
definable
races
within
the
human
species
that
these
can
be
defined
with
sufficient
clarity
and
certainty
as
to
be
accurately
applied
in
particular
situations
and
further
let's
assume
that
the
state
of
virginia's
laws
do
exactly
this
and
incidentally,
all
of
this
is
something
that
the
anthropologist
have
not
been
able
to
do
it,
we
submit
but
nevertheless,
the
antimiscegenation
laws
of
virginia
and
its
sister
states
are
unconstitutional.
for
if
the
antimiscegenation
laws
purport
to
preserve
morphologic
or
physical
differences.
that
is
a
differences
essentially
in
the
shape
of
the
eyes,
the
size
of
noses
or
the
texture
of
hair,
pigmentation
of
skin,
such
differences
are
meaningless
and
neutral.
they
serve
no
proper
legislative
purpose.
to
state
the
proposition
in
itself
is
to
expose
the
other
absurdity.
moreover,
the
antimiscegenation
laws
would
take
the
aspiration
of
marriage
which
is
common
to
all
people
and
which
is
otherwise
blessed
by
the
state
and
which
institution
incidentally
has
found
of
course
upon
one
of
man's
biological
grimes,
it
would
take
this
and
solely
on
the
base
of
rates,
it
would
convert
it
into
a
crime.
in
mclaughlin
where
this
court
considered
a
florida
statute
which
involved
"
concepts
of
sexual
decency
dealing
with
extramarital
and
premarital
promiscuity,
this
court
nevertheless
struck
down
such
statute
because
it
was
formulated
on
racial
classification
and
thus
laid
an
unequal
hand
on
those
who
committed
intrinsically
the
same
quality
of
offense.
now,
for
the
appellants
here,
richard
loving
and
miller
loving
marriage
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
crime.
it
is
not
an
offense
even
under
virginia
clause.
by
virginia
clause,
it
was
their
race,
it
was
their
race
which
made
it
an
offense.
incidentally
while
mr.
loving
apparently
admitted
that
he
was
white
and
thereby
admitted
to
the
fact
which
rendered
his
marriage
a
criminal
act
under
virginia's
laws,
it
is
suggested
that
he
was
incapable
of
making
a
knowing
admission
that
he
was
"a
pure
white
race"
or
"had
no
trace
whatever
of
any
blood
other
than
caucasian."
now,
we
further
submit
that
the
antimiscegenation
laws
involved
an
unequal
application
of
the
laws.
virginia's
express
state
policy
for
its
antimiscegenation
laws
has
been
declared
to
maintain
"purity
of
public
morals,
preservation
of
racial
integrity
as
well
as
racial
pride
and
to
prevent
a
mongrel
breed
of
citizens."
however,
under
these
antimiscegenation
laws
since
only
white
persons
are
prevented
from
marrying
outside
of
their
race
and
all
other
races
are
free
to
intermarry
and
within
this
particular
context,
they're
free
thereby
to
despoil
one
another
and
destroy
their
racial
integrity,
purity
and
pride,
virginia's
laws
are
exposed
for
exactly
what
they
are,
a
concept
based
upon
racial
superior
--
superiority
that
of
the
white
race
and
white
race
only.
now,
we
submit
that
striking
down
of
the
antimiscegenation
laws,
well
first
of
all,
not
to
do
certain
things.
it
will
not
force
anyone
to
do
what
he
presently
does
not
wish
to
do.
it
does
not
force
anyone
to
marry
outside
of
his
race
by
striking
down
the
antimiscegenation
laws.
by
striking
down
the
antimiscegenation
laws,
no
one
is
called
to
do,
undo
anything
what
she
has
already
done
and
in
this
connection,
perhaps
a
distinction
maybe
made
to
the
brown
case
or
the
school
desegregation
cases.
on
the
contrary
by
striking
down
the
antimiscegenation
laws,
freedom
of
choice
will
be
restored
to
all
individuals
including
those
who
are
opposed
to
racial
intermarriage.
for
the
white
person
who
marries
another
white
person
does
not,
under
virginia's
laws
as
they
now
stand
has
any
other
choice.
we
submit
that
race
as
a
factor
has
no
proper
place
in
state's
laws
that
governing
whom
a
person
by
mutual
choice
may
or
may
not
marry.
now,
the
major
such
statutory
intervention
upon
personal
freedom
may
be
exposed
by
applying
the
same
operative
racial
principle
in
reverse.
let
us
suppose
that
the
state
of
virginia
exercised
its
powers
of
determining
--
of
applying
this
racial
principle
so
that
it
decreed
at
every
citizen
must
marry
a
person
of
a
different
race,
this
would
indeed
be
shocking
that
the
same
operative
principle
is
happen
to
be
geared
in
a
way
it
is
presently
geared
makes
it
no
less
shocking
and
the
meaning
to
the
citizen.
a
question
was
raised
--
mr.
william
m.
marutani
no,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
first
of
all,
it
is
no
answer
to
a
compound
what
we
believe
to
be
wrong.
moreover,
as
a
practical
matter,
who
is
to
determine
--
who
is
to
categorize
how
many
races
there?
the
anthropologists
range
from
two
to
200,
live
in
south
and
they
are
the
so-called,
experts.
they
are
unable
to
agree.
if
anthropologist
cannot
agree,
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
legislators
to
determine
and
then
having
determined
it
to
apply
it.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
the
--
i
believe
the
thrust
of
that
argument
sir
is
that
to
expose
this
law
for
exactly
what
it
is.
it
is
a
white
supremacy
law.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
might
answer
that
i
do
not
know
except
by
custom.
i
can
state
for
example
that
my
own
mother
would
have
strenuously
objected
to
my
marrying
a
person
of
the
white
race.
now,
mr.
justice
potter
i
believe
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
properly
has
a
function
to
play
in
the
area
of
control
of
marriage.
reference
is
made
to
consanguinity,
and
of
course
to
other
standards,
mentality,
age.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
yes.
now,
we
submit
that
the
racial
classification
cannot
be
equated
with
these
standards
because
racial
classification
is
not
an
additional
standard
which
is
added
on
the
same
level
as
these
standards
was
--
were
just
enumerated.
they
are
superimposed
over
and
above
all
these
other
standards.
to
restate
it
in
another
way,
the
standards
of
consanguinity,
mentality,
age
and
number
of
spouse
and
so
forth
apply
to
all
races,
white,
black,
yellow,
it
doesn't
matter
to
all
races
without
any
distinction,
but
now
the
racial
factor
is
superimposed
over
and
above
this
and
is
therefore
is
not
on
the
same
level.
it
is
something
different.
it
is
something
additional
and
over
and
above
on
a
different
level.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
marutani,
legal
counsel
for
the
japanese
american
citizens
league
which
has
filed
a
brief
amicus

in
this
appeal.
on
behalf
of
the
japanese
american

league,
i
would
like
to
thank
this
court
for
this
privilege.
because
the
issues
before
this
court
today
revolve
around
the
question
of
race,
may
i
be
excused
in
making
a
brief
personal
reference
in
this
regard?
as
a
nisei,
that
is
american
born
and
raised
in
this
country
but
whose
parents
came
from
japan,
i
am
and
i
say
this
with
some
trepidation
of
being
challenged,
perhaps
among
those
few
in

courtroom
along
with
the
few
other
nisei
who

who

and
to
prevent
a
mongrel
breed
of
citizens."
however,
under
these
antimiscegenation
laws
since
only
white
persons
are
prevented
from
marrying
outside
of
their
race
and
all
other
races
are
free
to
intermarry
and
within
this
particular
context,
they're
free
thereby
to
despoil
one
another
and
destroy
their
racial
integrity,
purity
and
pride,
virginia's
laws
are
exposed
for
exactly
what
they
are,
a
concept
based
upon
racial
superior
--
superiority
that
of
the
white
race
and
white
race
only.
now,
we
submit
that
striking
down
of
the
antimiscegenation
laws,
well
first
of
all,
not
to
do
certain
things.
it
will
not
force
anyone
to
do
what
he
presently
does
not
wish
to
do.
it
does
not
force
anyone
to
marry
outside
of
his
race
by
striking
down
the
antimiscegenation
laws.
by
striking
down
the
antimiscegenation
laws,
no
one
is
called
to
do,
undo
anything
what
she
has
already
done
and
in
this
connection,
perhaps
a
distinction
maybe
made
to
the
brown
case
or
the
school
desegregation
cases.
on
the
contrary
by
striking
down
the
antimiscegenation
laws,
freedom
of
choice
will
be
restored
to
all
individuals
including
those
who
are
opposed
to
racial
intermarriage.
for
the
white
person
who
marries
another
white
person
does
not,
under
virginia's
laws
as
they
now
stand
has
any
other
choice.
we
submit
that
race
as
a
factor
has
no
proper
place
in
state's
laws
that
governing
whom
a
person
by
mutual
choice
may
or
may
not
marry.
now,
the
major
such
statutory
intervention
upon
personal
freedom
may
be
exposed
by
applying
the
same
operative
racial
principle
in
reverse.
let
us
suppose
that
the
state
of
virginia
exercised
its
powers
of
determining
--
of
applying
this
racial
principle
so
that
it
decreed
at
every
citizen
must
marry
a
person
of
a
different
race,
this
would
indeed
be
shocking
that
the
same
operative
principle
is
happen
to
be
geared
in
a
way
it
is
presently
geared
makes
it
no
less
shocking
and
the
meaning
to
the
citizen.
a
question
was
raised
--
mr.
william
m.
marutani
no,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
first
of
all,
it
is
no
answer
to
a
compound
what
we
believe
to
be
wrong.
moreover,
as
a
practical
matter,
who
is
to
determine
--
who
is
to
categorize
how
many
races
there?
the
anthropologists
range
from
two
to
200,
live
in
south
and
they
are
the
so-called,
experts.
they
are
unable
to
agree.
if
anthropologist
cannot
agree,
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
legislators
to
determine
and
then
having
determined
it
to
apply
it.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
the
--
i
believe
the
thrust
of
that
argument
sir
is
that
to
expose
this
law
for
exactly
what
it
is.
it
is
a
white
supremacy
law.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
might
answer
that
i
do
not
know
except
by
custom.
i
can
state
for
example
that
my
own
mother
would
have
strenuously
objected
to
my
marrying
a
person
of
the
white
race.
now,
mr.
justice
potter
i
believe
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
properly
has
a
function
to
play
in
the
area
of
control
of
marriage.
reference
is
made
to
consanguinity,
and
of
course
to
other
standards,
mentality,
age.
mr.
william
m.
marutani
yes.
now,
we
submit
that
the
racial
classification
cannot
be
equated
with
these
standards
because
racial
classification
is
not
an
additional
standard
which
is
added
on
the
same
level
as
these
standards
was
--
were
just
enumerated.
they
are
superimposed
over
and
above
all
these
other
standards.
to
restate
it
in
another
way,
the
standards
of
consanguinity,
mentality,
age
and
number
of
spouse
and
so
forth
apply
to
all
races,
white,
black,
yellow,
it
doesn't
matter
to
all
races
without
any
distinction,
but
now
the
racial
factor
is
superimposed
over
and
above
this
and
is
therefore
is
not
on
the
same
level.
it
is
something
different.
it
is
something
additional
and
over
and
above
on
a
different
level.
thank
you.
