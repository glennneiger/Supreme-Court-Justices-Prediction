would
you
mind
telling
me
what
case
that
was?
justice

black
kinn
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
effort
to
repeal
the
law
in
virginia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you're
arguing
the
due
process
question
on
the
theory
that
even
if
the
court
holds
that
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
it
is
necessary
to
go
on
and
reach
the
broad
expanses
you
mentioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
how
that
would
be
possible
if
the
court
held,
according
to
the
first
argument,
this
is
a
plain
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
that
--
could
that
possibly
be
fit
through
if
the
court
should
decide
to
straight
out
that
the
state
cannot
prevent
a
marriage,
the
relationship
of
marriage
between
the
whites
and
the
blacks
because
of
their
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
settle
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
settle
it
constitutionally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
it's
not
material
perhaps
in
any
way,
but
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
there
are
laws
in
japan
which
prohibits
the
other
marriage
between
japanese
and
what
you
might
call
a
caucasian
or
white
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
an
orthodox
--
an
orthodox
rabbi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
we
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
you
can't
settle
that
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
aside
from
all
questions
from
the
genetics,
psychology,
psychiatry,
sociology,
and
everything
else
aside
from
all
of
them,
forgetting
it
for
the
moment,
is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
that
the
object
of
this
statute,
the
basic
premise
on
which
they
rest,
is
that
the
white
people
are
superiors
of
the
colored
people
and
should
not
be
permitted
to
marry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what
they
labeled
it.
i'm
just
asking
your
--
your
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
possible
basis,
or
is
--
is
not
the
basic
premise
on
which
they
read
white
people
are
superior
to
the
colored
people
and
that
they
should
not
therefore
be
permitted
to
marry
because
it
might
pollute
the
white
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
--
do
you
would
think
there's
a
stronger
justification
that
that
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
basic
thing
in
which
they
rested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whether
its
1967
or
1868,
makes
no
difference
to
me
in
discussion
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
is
that
--
as
i
would
see
it,
is
it
not
true
that
that
is
the
basic
reason
it
was
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
a
man
who
belongs
for
this
race,
that
is
forbidden
to
marry
--
marry
in
the
other
race.
it's
bound
to
feel
that
he
is
not
given
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
justice
hugo

black
work
what?
justice

black
(voice

prohibition
is
the
same
but
it's
the
common
sense
and
pragmatic
of
it
not
as
the
result
of
the
old
slavery
days.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
old
feeling
that
the
white
man
which
a
period
to
the
colored,
which
was
exactly
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
to
prevent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
one
of
the
group
of
statutes,
is
it
not,
intended
to
make
it
intolerable
or
impossible
or
to
be
very
burdensome
for
white
and
colored
people
to
marry
and
for
the
japanese
and
white
people
to
marry
and
all
these
others.
how
can
they
be
separated,
i
don't
quite
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
are
not
all
based
on
the
premise
of
doing
something
to
make
it
bad
or
hard
or
difficult
or
illegal
for
the
two
groups
to
marry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
not
all
of
the
group.
justice

black
what
--
what
effect
that
does
have
on
a
white
person
and
a
colored
person
--
justice

black
--
who's
married
in
new
york
and
move
to
virginia
to
live?
justice
hugo

black
under
virginia
law?
justice

i
suppose
that
they
would
be
living
an

and
that
could
be

justice

that
should

they
