justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't,
the
question
really
would
it
--
what
form
it
should
go
to
rather
than
what
law
you
should
apply?
i
thought
the
issue
here
was
whether
you
had
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
or
whether
you
have
to
go
with
it
or
whether
you're
going
to
the
state
court?
it
could
be
that
you
might
hold
that
he
could
go
into
the
state
court?
the
state
court
would
have
to
apply
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
issue
is,
what
form
it
should
go
into
--
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
say
if
the
contract
said,
it's
like
a
bargain
contract
said
that
we
will
take
to
the
adjustment
board
all
matters
of
the
interpretation
after
this
contract
including
the
matters
of
wrongful
discharged?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
adjustment
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
wouldn't
you
--
why
wouldn't
you
argue
then?
why
wouldn't
you
argue
then
that
he's
been
fired
wrongfully
that
the
contract
is
no
longer
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
go
to
the
board,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
would
you
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
eventhough
the
contract
said
he
would
go
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
isn't
it
difficult
to
claim
that
the
--
that
congress
has
said
that
the
adjustment
board
--
that
the
parties
have
no
alternative.
the
congress
has
said
that
the
adjustment
board
shall
consider
certain
matters
and
no
one
else.
now,
if
you're
--
the
contract
rather
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
you
wouldn't
be
attacking
the
contract
against
public
policy,
you
have
to
attack
the
statute,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
an
issue
here,
you
see
since
the
discharged
you
agree
raises
a
question
of
violation
of
the
contract.
that
may
--
i
mean,
it
may
be
an
issue
here
whether
the
board
except
for
our
moore
that
line
of
decision
whether
the
statute
doesn't
require
to
go
to
the
board.
but
i'm
just
wondering
this,
and
you
keep
talking
state
and
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
just
like
to
come
back
to
really,
the
only
problem
is
just
because
it
does
build
there.
here
is
it
not
--
is
--
are
you
obliged
to
take
this
claim
to
the
adjustment
board
or
may
you
go
into
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
because
when
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
get
before
the
adjustment
board,
there's
no
use
in
talking
in
terms
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
either
federal
law,
if
you
have
to
go
before
the
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
board,
you're
going
to
take
whatever
law
they
give
you.
i
don't
know
if
they
give
you
federal
state
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
law
at
all
for
that
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
here
is
the
two
parties
who
compose
the
board
have
already
resolved
this
case
against
your
client.
they
said
he
was
properly
discharged
as
these
letters
between
them
indicate
and
they
can't
get
anything
except
a
rubber
stamp
from
what
they
already
agreed
upon.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
party
of
your
argument
is
that
the
adjustment
board
is
not
a
reliable
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
adjustment
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
he
--
what
if
he
says
that
breach
of
contract,
i
want
--
this
is
wrongful
discharged.
i
want
back
pay
and
reinstatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
won't
question?
but
how
possibly
can
a
--
to
be
a
different
between
this
thing.
i
want
damages
namely
back
pay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
reinstatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
moore
was
an
obstruction
of
the
railroad
adjust
--
railroad
labor
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
--
was
it
--
is
it
near
to
--
is
it
a
piece
of
statutory
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
adjustment
board
therefore
going
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
it
would
take?
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
almost
as
long
as
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
answer
to
the
--
what
the
idea
that
the
adjustment
board
is
really
that
the
employee
there
would
just
be
before
the
same
two
people
who
already
said
that
he
was
rightfully
discharged
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
wrongfully.
this
is
a
balance
for
the
employee
and
no
third
party
is
in
there
to
--
why
should
--
why
should
the
employee
have
to
stop
with
the
board
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
government
--
but
the
normal
dispute,
you
have
to
admit
arises
almost
all
the
time
when
the
union
and
management
has
come
to
let
things
points
of
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
under
the
act
if
the
thing
isn't
settled
on
the
property
and
the
employee
isn't
satisfied,
doesn't
one
side
of
the
other
half
to
take
it
to
the
adjustment
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
he
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
union
cannot
refuse
on
his
behalf
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--before
the
adjustment
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
why
if
--
am
i
correctly
advise
that
what
this
means
is,
initially
the
matter
would
be
considered
only
by
the
road
and
union
representatives,
five
a
piece
or
whatever
panel
they
chose.
justice
byron
r.
white
there'll
be
no
impartial
party
involved.
there's
no
hearing.
there's
no
trial.
there's
no
evidence.
everything
is
submitted
on
written
documents
which
are
considered
by
that
body
and
a
determination
rendered
ordinarily
within
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
trial
in
the
sense
of
witnesses
being
heard
before
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
union
--
did
the
union
refuse
to
represent
this
man
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
here
in
the
record
whether
they
did
it
or
didn't.
they
just
agree
that
he
was
rightfully
discharged
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
right
to
determine?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't,
the
question
really
would
it

what

it

it
could
be
that
you
might
hold
that
he
could
go
into
the
state
court?
the
state
court
would
have
to
apply
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
issue
is,
what
form
it
should
go
into

justice
byron

said

justice
