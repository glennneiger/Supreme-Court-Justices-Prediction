did
they

divisions
track
the
railway

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
then
did
it
provide
for
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
about
the
contract
and
one
way
or
another
does
it
except
--
the
railway
labor
act
could
make
go
to
the

anyway.
justice
william
j.

you
can't
contract
out

can
you
--
you
couldn't

say,
well
our

justice
william
j.

well,
the
obligation
to
go
to
the
board
as
i
understand
it
is
made
mandatory
by
the

in
those
cases
where
the
court's
jurisdiction
attaches
which
matters
of
interpretation
and
application
of
what

moore

was
not
present.
where,
there
was

the

sue
for
damages

the

to
discharge
its

a

that
then
was

justice
william
j.

well,

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
tell
me
this,
to
affirm
do
we

to
overrule
moore,
in
this

justice
william
j.

uh-hum.
justice
william
