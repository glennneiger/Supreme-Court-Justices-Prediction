that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,

chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
that
last
paragraph?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
pretty
fast
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ackerman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
you
go
to
that.
you
--
i'd
like
to
get
oriented
on
it.
you
said
that
the
correspondence
between
the
union
and
the
company
was
out
of
context.
you
did
mention
in
the
letter
that
came
to
the
employee
himself.
now,
do
i
understand
that
it's
your
position
that
he
was
not
discharged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
do,
i'd
like
to
have
your
report
to
the
letter
they
originally
sent
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'm
talking
about
the
next
letter
that
they
wrote
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
went
farther
than
that,
didn't
they?
didn't
they
say,
“we'll
no
longer
consider
you
on
the
roles
of
employment
of
this
company?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
mean
in
the
common
language?
they
just
part,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
understand
but
--
i
understand
your
position
there.
but
i
wonder
if
you
can
see
that
the
man
was
discharged
or
do
you
contend
otherwise?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
the
two?
i
don't
--
i
don't
say
which
position
you
should
take
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
one
of
the
two,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
might
consider
that
difference
but
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
concede
that
he
was
discharged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
read
the
last
--
would
you
read
the
last
paragraph
of
that
letter
that
i
just
referred
to.
i
don't
know
where
it
is?
where
it,
isn't
in
our
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
it
is
in?
what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
68
of
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
that
the
man
be
–
could
a
man
be
discharged
any
more
effectively?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
do
we
quiver
about
it
whether
it's
impractical
matter
or
whether
he
is?
why
do
we
acquire
of
the
other?
alright,
though
let
me
worry
about
it.
