mr.
jerome
ackerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
touch
just
briefly
on
the
facts
i
think
that
perhaps
they've
been
taken
a
little
bit
out
of
context.
mr.
walker's
suit
here
is
a
suit
that
arises
out
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
only
right
that
walker
has
in
this
case
grows
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
he
has
no
common
law
rights
and
doesn't
claim
it.
walker
did
not
pursue
either
the
contractual
procedures
set
up
under
his
union
contract
or
the
administrative
procedures
set
up
under
the
railway
labor
act
through
the
railroad
adjustment
board
in
attempting
to
vindicate
what
he
thought
was
improper
deprivation
of
a
contract
right
arising
out
of
the
union
contract.
now,
much
has
been
made
of
the
correspondence
between
the
representative
of
the
union
and
the
director
of
labor
relations
of
the
southern
following
the
terminations
of
mr.
walker's
seniority.
that
--
that
correspondence
occurred
well
after
the
period
during
which
walker
could
have
but
did
not
attempt
to
pursue
to
their
conclusion
his
contractual
remedies.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you?
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
contractual
provisions
provided
for
normal
handling
of
the
dispute
up
through
the
various
officers
who
would
be
responsible
for
it.
the
superintendent
for
example
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
it
--
the
contract
itself
did
not
specifically
mention
the
adjustment
board.
but
i
think
that
it
generally
recognized
in
the
industry
that
all
contracts
contemplates
that
if
there
is
disagreement
at
the
end
of
the
contents
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
this
is
correct.
the
railway
labor
act
certainly
provide
an
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
i
didn't
say
that
you
couldn't.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
this
is
precisely
such
a
case
because
the
question
of
the
laws
of
mr.
walker's
seniority
turns
on
that
language
of
a
provision
of
a
contract.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no.
moore
was
not
unlike
this
case.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
this
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
would
have
thought
that
the
moore
case
was
perhaps
not
so
much
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
as
it
was
a
notion
that
state
law
could
have
some
application
in
this
field.
and
its
state
law
could
have
some
application
in
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
would
have
viewed
more
as
i
started
to
say
before.
as
a
case
in
which
the
court
took
the
view
that
state
law
could
apply
to
a
suit
on
a
contract
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
believe
so.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
unless
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
that
--
that's
quite
correct.
the
court
did
not
overrule
moore
and
maddox
unless
the
court
were
to
take
the
rather
narrow
view
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
namely
the
focus
on
the
question
of
whether
exhaustion
of
contractual
remedies
was
required
quite
a
part
from
the
resort
of
the
adjustment
board.
i
believe
that
it
would
have
to
overrule
moore
in
order
to
affirm
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
here
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
mr.
justice
white,
this
whole
line
of
argument
is
predicated
on
an
assumption
that
there
is
something
inherently
untrustworthy
about
the
railroad
adjustment
board
simply
because
it
is
a
balance
agency.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
this
is
correct.
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
in
every
case
in
which
a
union
and
the
management
do
not
have
a
conflicting
point
of
view
that
the
union
is
for
that
reason
alone
somehow
dealing
unfairly
with
the
employee
involved.
it's
quite
possible
and
certainly
was
evidenced
here
that
the
union
happen
to
agree
with
the
management
interpretation
of
the
contract.
and
this
was
really
the
gist
of
the
exchange
of
correspondence
that
mr.
hamrick
spoke
about
before
but
he
didn't
point
out
that
there
was
discussion
by
the
official
of
the
union
of
the
specific
contract
provisions
involved
and
the
question
of
whether
walker
had
pursued
his
remedies
as
he
was
suppose
to
under
the
contract
and
agree
that
there
was
a
basis
for
terminating
walker
seniority.
now
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
either
the
em
--
the
carrier.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
union
or
an
employee,
an
employee
himself
can
take
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
oh,
yes.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
an
employee
has
a
right
to
take
a
case
before
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
yes.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
believe
that
there
are
variations
in
this
practice.
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
believe
that
in
the
article
by
garrison
we've
cited
in
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
--
our
brief,
mention
is
made
of
cases
in
which
hearings
have
been
held
and
i
think
that
from
time
to
time
there
are
hearings.
you
--
you
touched
briefly
before
in
another
aspect
of
the
adjustment
board
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
mr.
walker
told
him
to
report
for
work
within
30
days
pursuant
to
a
specific
provision
of
a
contract
for
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
--
for
--
forfeit
his
seniority.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
he
was
then
told
that
because
of
his
failure
to
report
within
the
time
period.
he's
seniority
had
been
terminated.
and
the
termination
of
his
seniority
and
taking
him
off
the
seniority
list
has,
i
would
say
the
same
effect
as
discharging.
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
that
is
quite
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
intend
or
try
to
make
a
great
issue
out
of
the
distinction.
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
in
this
particular
context,
the
termination
of
the
seniority
and
if
you
will,
discharged.
the
problem
arose
as
one
purely
of
contract
interpretation.
this
isn't
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
--
i
was
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
as
a
practical
matter.
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
you
say
he
was
discharged
or
his
seniority
was
terminated.
the
effect
is
the
same.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
he
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
i
do
not
say
that
he
was
discharged
if
one
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
last
paragraph,
just
please
turn
in
all
company
property.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
this
is
page
68.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
second
to
the
last
paragraph,
“as
you
did
not
report
and
protect
your
seniority
as
instructed
and
this
is
to
advise
you
under
the
provisions
of
the
fireman's
agreement,
article
25
(e)
(3),
that
your
name
has
been
stricken
from
the
fireman
seniority
list
and
you
are
no
longer
considered
an
employee
of
the
southern
railroad
company.”
mr.
jerome
ackerman
your
honor,
i
say
as
practical
matter.
i
think
that
this
is
the
same
as
a
discharged.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
you
had
said
before
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
didn't
care
which
way
i
came
out
on
this
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
--
it
was
the
question
how
i
viewed
it.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
agreement,
he
was
not
discharged.
his
seniority
was
terminated.
he
was
no
longer
considered
an
employee
of
the
company.
he
was
not
discharged
in
the
sense
that
i
think
of
that
word
and
i
think
of
that
word
is
quite
a
word
of
art.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
assume
he
could
have
mr.
hamrick
represent
him.
he
could
have
asked
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
right.
the
--
the
railroad
boards
or
the
railroad
adjustment
boards
procedure
does
not
bar
anyone
from
being
represented
by
someone
of
his
choosing.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
a
union
ordinarily
would
represent
an
employee
and
this
is
usually
what
would
happen
but
if
for
any
reason
there
was
no
union
that
represents
the
employee.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
perhaps
so.
of
course
in
that
case
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
pointed
out,
the
employee
is
not
without
remedy.
a
union
does
have
an
obligation
to
fairly
represent
all
of
the
people
or
for
whom
it
act
as
bargaining
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
--
i
honestly
don't
know.
if
it
was
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
--
this
is
correct.
mr.
tolleson
of
the
southern
communicated
with
the
union
stated
all
of
the
facts
and
asked
what
their
position
was
as
to
the
termination
of
mr.
walker's
seniority
and
the
responding
letter
is
the
one
that
was
described
before
it.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
--
i
suppose
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
icc?
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
don't
know.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
i
don't.
as
--
as
we
view
the
principle
issue
in
this
case,
it
is
whether
federal
or
state
law
will
govern
the
question
of
whether
an
employee
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
yes.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
central
airlines
decided
that
federal
law
applies
to
suits
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
there
--
it
would
seem
that
there's
conflict
between
central
airlines
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well
--
we
submit
that
the
rational
of
maddox
is
just
as
applicable
to
a
case
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
moore
turned
on
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
state
law.
i
think
that
the
koppal
case
made
this
even
clearer
because
the
koppal
case
proceeded
right
down
the
line
on
the
notion
that
state
law
was
applicable
here.
there
was
no
--
no
court
at
all
of
anything
but
state
law
being
applicable
in
the
koppal
case.
now
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
there
was
a
discharged.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
that
is
correct.
now
in
that
context,
when
central
airlines
came
along
in
1963
and
this
court
held
that
federal
law
is
applicable
to
suits
on
collective
bargaining
agreements
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
railway
labor
act,
i
think
that
that
has
the
same
effect
as
saying
that
if
moore
and
koppal
were
decided
in
a
context
of
state
law
and
i
thought
that
state
law
applied
the
under
pinning
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
maddox
for
those
decisions
was
on
--
was
removed.
that
being
--
that
being
so
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
but
state
--
under
--
under
some
state
laws
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
in
some
situations
under
state
law,
you
will
be
remitted
to
your
remedy
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
in
the
koppal
case.
in
the
koppal
case,
the
--
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
exhaustion
of
remedies
was
required.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
in
footnote
14,
in
its
decision
in
maddox,
the
court
expressly
declined
to
overrule
moore
and
koppal
cases.
they
pointed
out
that
such
action
should
await
the
case
under
the
railway
labor
act
in
which
the
distinctive
features
of
the
administrative
remedies
could
be
considered
in
context.
we
submit
that
in
analysis
of
the
administrative
remedies
that
are
available
through
the
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
are
essentially
the
same
as
the
procedures
that
are
available
in
the
routine
labor
arbitration
context.
the
procedures
are
informal.
the
scope
of
review
is
limited
to
just
about
the
same
degree
both
by
reason
of
this
court's
decision
in
gunther
and
in
other
cases
and
a
recent
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
reinforces
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
scope
of
review
from
adjustment
board
decisions.
the
--
the
remedies
that
are
available
to
an
employee
in
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board
are
certainly
no
less
than
remedies
available
in
ordinary
arbitration
procedures.
indeed,
they're
probably
more
flexible
as
this
court
itself
is
aware
from
the
facts
in
gunther
case.
that
is
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
terms
of
a
point
in
--
of
doctors
and
so
on
to
examine
the
employee.
but
under
the
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
reinstatement
as
possible,
back
pay
awards
are
possible,
so
that
the
summons
substance
is
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
ordinary
labor
arbitrations
of
the
type
that
would
have
been
involved
in
maddox
had
the
employee
there
exhausted
his
contractual
remedies
and
the
procedures
provided
for
under
the
railway
labor
act
if
an
employee
resorts
to
or
a
union
resorts
to
the
adjustment
board.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
touch
just
briefly
on
the
facts
i
think
that
perhaps
they've
been
taken
a
little
bit
out
of
context.
mr.
walker's
suit
here
is
a
suit
that
arises
out
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
only
right
that
walker
has
in
this
case
grows
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
he
has
no
common
law
rights
and
doesn't
claim
it.
walker
did
not
pursue
either
the
contractual
procedures
set
up
under
his
union
contract
or
the
administrative
procedures
set
up
under
the
railway
labor
act
through
the
railroad
adjustment
board
in
attempting
to
vindicate
what
he
thought
was
improper
deprivation
of
a
contract
right
arising
out
of
the
union
contract.
now,
much
has
been
made
of
the
correspondence
between
the
representative
of
the
union
and
the
director
of
labor
relations
of
the
southern
following
the
terminations
of
mr.
walker's
seniority.
that
--
that
correspondence
occurred
well
after
the
period
during
which
walker
could
have
but
did
not
attempt
to
pursue
to
their
conclusion
his
contractual
remedies.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you?
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
contractual
provisions
provided
for
normal
handling
of
the
dispute
up
through
the
various
officers
who
would
be
responsible
for
it.
the
superintendent
for
example
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
it
--
the
contract
itself
did
not
specifically
mention
the
adjustment
board.
but
i
think
that
it
generally
recognized
in
the
industry
that
all
contracts
contemplates
that
if
there
is
disagreement
at
the
end
of
the
contents
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
this
is
correct.
the
railway
labor
act
certainly
provide
an
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
i
didn't
say
that
you
couldn't.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
this
is
precisely
such
a
case
because
the
question
of
the
laws
of
mr.
walker's
seniority
turns
on
that
language
of
a
provision
of
a
contract.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no.
moore
was
not
unlike
this
case.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
this
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
would
have
thought
that
the
moore
case
was
perhaps
not
so
much
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
as
it
was
a
notion
that
state
law
could
have
some
application
in
this
field.
and
its
state
law
could
have
some
application
in
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
would
have
viewed
more
as
i
started
to
say
before.
as
a
case
in
which
the
court
took
the
view
that
state
law
could
apply
to
a
suit
on
a
contract
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
believe
so.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
unless
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
that
--
that's
quite
correct.
the
court
did
not
overrule
moore
and
maddox
unless
the
court
were
to
take
the
rather
narrow
view
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
namely
the
focus
on
the
question
of
whether
exhaustion
of
contractual
remedies
was
required
quite
a
part
from
the
resort
of
the
adjustment
board.
i
believe
that
it
would
have
to
overrule
moore
in
order
to
affirm
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
here
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
mr.
justice
white,
this
whole
line
of
argument
is
predicated
on
an
assumption
that
there
is
something
inherently
untrustworthy
about
the
railroad
adjustment
board
simply
because
it
is
a
balance
agency.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
this
is
correct.
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
in
every
case
in
which
a
union
and
the
management
do
not
have
a
conflicting
point
of
view
that
the
union
is
for
that
reason
alone
somehow
dealing
unfairly
with
the
employee
involved.
it's
quite
possible
and
certainly
was
evidenced
here
that
the
union
happen
to
agree
with
the
management
interpretation
of
the
contract.
and
this
was
really
the
gist
of
the
exchange
of
correspondence
that
mr.
hamrick
spoke
about
before
but
he
didn't
point
out
that
there
was
discussion
by
the
official
of
the
union
of
the
specific
contract
provisions
involved
and
the
question
of
whether
walker
had
pursued
his
remedies
as
he
was
suppose
to
under
the
contract
and
agree
that
there
was
a
basis
for
terminating
walker
seniority.
now
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
either
the
em
--
the
carrier.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
union
or
an
employee,
an
employee
himself
can
take
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
oh,
yes.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
an
employee
has
a
right
to
take
a
case
before
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
yes.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
believe
that
there
are
variations
in
this
practice.
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
believe
that
in
the
article
by
garrison
we've
cited
in
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
--
our
brief,
mention
is
made
of
cases
in
which
hearings
have
been
held
and
i
think
that
from
time
to
time
there
are
hearings.
you
--
you
touched
briefly
before
in
another
aspect
of
the
adjustment
board
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
mr.
walker
told
him
to
report
for
work
within
30
days
pursuant
to
a
specific
provision
of
a
contract
for
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
--
for
--
forfeit
his
seniority.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
he
was
then
told
that
because
of
his
failure
to
report
within
the
time
period.
he's
seniority
had
been
terminated.
and
the
termination
of
his
seniority
and
taking
him
off
the
seniority
list
has,
i
would
say
the
same
effect
as
discharging.
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
that
is
quite
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
intend
or
try
to
make
a
great
issue
out
of
the
distinction.
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
in
this
particular
context,
the
termination
of
the
seniority
and
if
you
will,
discharged.
the
problem
arose
as
one
purely
of
contract
interpretation.
this
isn't
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
--
i
was
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
as
a
practical
matter.
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
you
say
he
was
discharged
or
his
seniority
was
terminated.
the
effect
is
the
same.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
he
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
i
do
not
say
that
he
was
discharged
if
one
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
last
paragraph,
just
please
turn
in
all
company
property.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
this
is
page
68.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
second
to
the
last
paragraph,
“as
you
did
not
report
and
protect
your
seniority
as
instructed
and
this
is
to
advise
you
under
the
provisions
of
the
fireman's
agreement,
article
25
(e)
(3),
that
your
name
has
been
stricken
from
the
fireman
seniority
list
and
you
are
no
longer
considered
an
employee
of
the
southern
railroad
company.”
mr.
jerome
ackerman
your
honor,
i
say
as
practical
matter.
i
think
that
this
is
the
same
as
a
discharged.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
you
had
said
before
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
didn't
care
which
way
i
came
out
on
this
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
--
it
was
the
question
how
i
viewed
it.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
agreement,
he
was
not
discharged.
his
seniority
was
terminated.
he
was
no
longer
considered
an
employee
of
the
company.
he
was
not
discharged
in
the
sense
that
i
think
of
that
word
and
i
think
of
that
word
is
quite
a
word
of
art.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
assume
he
could
have
mr.
hamrick
represent
him.
he
could
have
asked
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
right.
the
--
the
railroad
boards
or
the
railroad
adjustment
boards
procedure
does
not
bar
anyone
from
being
represented
by
someone
of
his
choosing.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
a
union
ordinarily
would
represent
an
employee
and
this
is
usually
what
would
happen
but
if
for
any
reason
there
was
no
union
that
represents
the
employee.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
perhaps
so.
of
course
in
that
case
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
pointed
out,
the
employee
is
not
without
remedy.
a
union
does
have
an
obligation
to
fairly
represent
all
of
the
people
or
for
whom
it
act
as
bargaining
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
--
i
honestly
don't
know.
if
it
was
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
--
this
is
correct.
mr.
tolleson
of
the
southern
communicated
with
the
union
stated
all
of
the
facts
and
asked
what
their
position
was
as
to
the
termination
of
mr.
walker's
seniority
and
the
responding
letter
is
the
one
that
was
described
before
it.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
--
i
suppose
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
the
icc?
mr.
jerome
ackerman
i
don't
know.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
no,
i
don't.
as
--
as
we
view
the
principle
issue
in
this
case,
it
is
whether
federal
or
state
law
will
govern
the
question
of
whether
an
employee
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
yes.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
central
airlines
decided
that
federal
law
applies
to
suits
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
there
--
it
would
seem
that
there's
conflict
between
central
airlines
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well
--
we
submit
that
the
rational
of
maddox
is
just
as
applicable
to
a
case
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
moore
turned
on
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
state
law.
i
think
that
the
koppal
case
made
this
even
clearer
because
the
koppal
case
proceeded
right
down
the
line
on
the
notion
that
state
law
was
applicable
here.
there
was
no
--
no
court
at
all
of
anything
but
state
law
being
applicable
in
the
koppal
case.
now
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
there
was
a
discharged.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
that
is
correct.
now
in
that
context,
when
central
airlines
came
along
in
1963
and
this
court
held
that
federal
law
is
applicable
to
suits
on
collective
bargaining
agreements
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
railway
labor
act,
i
think
that
that
has
the
same
effect
as
saying
that
if
moore
and
koppal
were
decided
in
a
context
of
state
law
and
i
thought
that
state
law
applied
the
under
pinning
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
maddox
for
those
decisions
was
on
--
was
removed.
that
being
--
that
being
so
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
well,
but
state
--
under
--
under
some
state
laws
--
mr.
jerome
ackerman
in
some
situations
under
state
law,
you
will
be
remitted
to
your
remedy
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
in
the
koppal
case.
in
the
koppal
case,
the
--
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
exhaustion
of
remedies
was
required.
mr.
jerome
ackerman
in
footnote
14,
in
its
decision
in
maddox,
the
court
expressly
declined
to
overrule
moore
and
koppal
cases.
they
pointed
out
that
such
action
should
await
the
case
under
the
railway
labor
act
in
which
the
distinctive
features
of
the
administrative
remedies
could
be
considered
in
context.
we
submit
that
in
analysis
of
the
administrative
remedies
that
are
available
through
the
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
are
essentially
the
same
as
the
procedures
that
are
available
in
the
routine
labor
arbitration
context.
the
procedures
are
informal.
the
scope
of
review
is
limited
to
just
about
the
same
degree
both
by
reason
of
this
court's
decision
in
gunther
and
in
other
cases
and
a
recent
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
reinforces
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
scope
of
review
from
adjustment
board
decisions.
the
--
the
remedies
that
are
available
to
an
employee
in
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board
are
certainly
no
less
than
remedies
available
in
ordinary
arbitration
procedures.
indeed,
they're
probably
more
flexible
as
this
court
itself
is
aware
from
the
facts
in
gunther
case.
that
is
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
terms
of
a
point
in
--
of
doctors
and
so
on
to
examine
the
employee.
but
under
the
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
reinstatement
as
possible,
back
pay
awards
are
possible,
so
that
the
summons
substance
is
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
ordinary
labor
arbitrations
of
the
type
that
would
have
been
involved
in
maddox
had
the
employee
there
exhausted
his
contractual
remedies
and
the
procedures
provided
for
under
the
railway
labor
act
if
an
employee
resorts
to
or
a
union
resorts
to
the
adjustment
board.
thank
you.
