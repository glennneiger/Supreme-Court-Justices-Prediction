mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
court.
i'd
like
to
review
for
just
a
moment
the
factual
situation
in
this
case.
roy
walker
was
employed
by
the
southern
railroad
sometime
in
1944.
in
--
on
march
3,
1957,
he
was
informed
that
he
had
been
displaced
by
an
employee
with
greater
seniority.
he
then
informed
the
call
clerk
that
he
was
sick
and
was
going
home.
he
went
home
and
on
april
the
29th,
a
letter
was
directed
to
him
to
report
for
duty.
in
between
these
times,
it
was
contended
by
mr.
walker
that
he
had
informed
the
railroad
of
his
illness.
this
record
said,
“dear
sir,
i
understand
you
were
displaced
from
the
regular
job
at
airline
junction
march
3,
1957
and
i
was
yourself
since?
this
is
to
advise
you
that
you
stand
for
work
in
your
seniority
and
unless
you
protect
your
seniority
standing
within
30
days
from
the
date
of
this
letter,
you
will
have
opted
your
seniority.
yours
very
truly,
superintendent.”
that
letter
was
dated
april
the
29th
in
greenville,
south
carolina.
it
was
signed
for
may
the
30th
by
mr.
walker's
daughter.
he
was
on
the
hospital
at
the
time
and
didn't
have
knowledge
of
it
for
four
days.
he
then
went
down
on
may
the
29th
to
report
for
duty
and
discovered
that
his
name
had
been
stricken
from
the
seniority
list
because
he
had
not
reported
in
30
days.
this
is
actually
the
turning
point
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
discharged.
they
told
him
he
couldn't
go
to
work
that
he
had
been
fired.
he
went
to
see
the
superintendent
the
next
day.
the
superintendent
of
that
division,
mr.
brad
and
in
this
connection,
there
has
been
some
suggestion
here
that
taken
a
man's
seniority
doesn't
fire
him,
if
this
is
just
a
grievance
or
some
technical
situation?
well,
the
day
after
he
reported
and
was
told
that
his
seniority
was
taken.
the
superintendent
of
the
railroad
wrote
him
this
letter,
he
reported
this
letter
was
written
to
him
on
the
--
on
the
--
“please
refer
to
my
letter
dated
april
the
29,
1957,
advising
you
to
protect
your
seniority
within
30
days.
you
did
not
report
and
protect
your
seniority
as
instructed
and
this
is
stood
by
you
that
under
the
provisions
of
fireman's
agreement
and
so
forth.
your
name
has
been
stricken
from
the
firemen
seniority
list
and
you
are
no
longer
considered
an
employee
of
the
southern
railroad.
please
turn
in
all
company
property
you
have
in
your
possession
to
train
met
--
to
terminal
train
master
curly.
now,
there's
no
question
i
think
that
roy
walker
was
fired
and
he
was
fired
because
the
railroad
said
he
didn't
protect
his
seniority
within
30
days.
we
tried
this
case
in
the
western
district
court
before
judge
craven
and
judge
craven
found
this
fact.
walker
reported
for
work
on
may
29,
1957,
it
is
adjudged
that
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
30-day
period
within
which
he
was
required
to
report.
southern
for
job
his
seniority
as
of
may
28,
1957
was
therefore
unlawful
and
constituted
a
violation
of
his
contract.
so
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
we
tried
it
before
judge
craven
to
the
effect
that
walker
was
wrongfully
discharged.
now
then
at
this
juncture,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
thing
i
refer
to
it
again
later.
later
on
that
year
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
eight
days
before
the
maddox
decision.
yes,
sir.
now
then
later
on
that
summer,
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
between
mr.
l.g.
tolleson,
who
is
director
of
labor
relations
of
the
southern
railway,
and
mr.
r.l.
mccollan,
general
chairman
of
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
engineers.
these
letters
are
printed
in
the
appendix
for
my
brief
--
to
my
brief
because
by
early
were
not
included
in
the
printed
records.
to
make
the
long
story
short,
mr.
tolleson
writes
to
mr.
mccollan
in
my
exhibit
3
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
and
after
he
goes
through
the
whole
discussion,
he
says
in
next
to
the
last
paragraph
about
the
middle
of
paragraph.
this
is
a
railroad
writing
to
the
union
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
this
is
the
railroad
writing
to
the
union
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
--
director
of
rail
--
director
of
labor
relations
writing
to
the
union,
“your
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
the
doctor
has
use
a
history
which
i
believe
he
will
agree
anyone
will
interpret
as
meaning
that
walker
was
unable
to
work
during
the
period
he
was
off.
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
related
above,
will
you
please
advise
promptly
what
your
position
is?”
the
labor
union
asked
the
railroad.
here
is
what
the
general
chairman
of
mr.
walker's
union
wrote
in
response
to
that
letter.
it's
the
second
letter
in
the
appendix
and
then
its
exhibit
4.
“dear
mr.
tolleson.
referring
to
your
letter
of
august
23,
1957,
concerning
the
seniority
of
fireman
r.e.
walker
charlotte
division
north,
your
file.
this
matter
was
discussed
with
you
while
in
washington
september
the
11th.
you
requested
that
i
write
you
concerning
my
position
to
the
matter.
as
i
explain
to
you
in
commerce,
it
does
not
matter
with
the
organization
whether
this
man
is
returned
to
service
or
not.
this
is
the
general
chairman
of
the
union
who
should
be
expected
to
protect
mr.
walker
and
to
help
him
and
at
the
end
of
that
letter
he
said,
“considering
the
circumstances
in
this
case
and
the
claimant's
previous
record.
it
would
appear
that
the
best
action
to
take
would
be
to
let
the
matter
rested
it
is
with
fireman
walker's
name
removed
from
seniority
list.”
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
considering
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
claimant's
previous
record,
it
would
appear
that
the
best
action
to
take
would
be
to
let
the
matter
rest
as
it
is
with
fireman
walker's
name
removed
from
the
list.
so
we
have
here
actually,
the
union
that
mr.
walker
paid
his
dues
to
that
he
relied
upon
saying
to
the
director
of
labor
relations
of
the
southern
railroad,
i
want
you
to
leave
him
fired
when
the
director
had
suggested
that
he
be
rehired.
now,
mr.
walker
came
to
me
to
know
what
to
do.
he
knew
that
the
general
chairman
of
the
union
didn't
like
him
and
he
knew
that
he
couldn't
get
his
job
back
through
the
union.
we
didn't
have
these
letters
at
the
time.
it
took
a
lot
of
adverse
examinations
before
the
southern
railroad
to
come
up
with
these
two
letters
with
this
exchange
of
letters
between
the
union
and
the
railroad.
and
so,
i
brought
a
notion
in
rather
for
county
court
the
wrongful
discharged
and
ask
for
damages.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
went
six
years
later.
i
brought
it
within
a
three-year
statute.
but
i
had
so
many
motions
to
strike
and
so
many
--
and
so
many
demurrers
and
so
many
procedure
difficulties
in
north
carolina.
we
can
take
a
non-suit
and
bring
the
action
again
within
a
year.
and
rather
in
the
preliminary
skirmishing
of
going
through
the
appeals
and
back
in
appeals
and
back
in
north
carolina,
i
simply
non-suit
in
my
compliant
and
made
it
conform
to
what
the
railroad
said
out
to
have.
and
that's
the
reason
it
looks
like
it
was
six
years
before
we
brought
it.
mr.
walker
came
to
me
and
we
brought
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged.
they
removed
it
to
the
federal
court
and
we
were
successful.
eight
days
after
that,
this
court
decided
the
republic
steel
against
maddox
and
the
railroad
gave
notice
to
the
appeal
to
the
circuit,
and
i
gave
notice
of
appeal
on
matter
of
mitigation
of
damages.
i
think
we
really
come
down
to
this
in
this
case.
the
federal
government
has
a
labor
policy
and
i
think
the
essential
question
is
this.
when
a
discharged
--
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
and
his
discharged
is
treated
by
him
as
fine,
does
that
take
his
case
outside
of
the
purview
of
the
federal
labor
policy?
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
what
makes
it
wrong.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
right.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
what
we're
down
to.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
now
in
the
past,
in
the
moore
cases
and
so
forth,
this
court
had
said
that
you
may
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged,
if
you
want
to?
or
you
may
ask
for
reinstatement?
but
if
you
ask
for
reinstatement
then
you
are
under
the
board
and
if
you
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged
it
does
by
the
common
law?
then
when
we
get
to
that
point,
we
come
here.
if
he
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged,
is
that
action
for
wrongful
discharged
governed
by
the
state
law
or
is
it
governed
by
the
federal
law?
now
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
this
court
there
properly
i
think
said
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
make
a
body
of
law
concerning
labor
relations
because
you
have
labor
acts
and
you
regulate
the
labor,
the
railroads
and
the
other
labor
act
and
it
is
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
make
a
body
of
law
governing
labor
relations
when
the
congress
pays
it
acts
for
that.
and
so
in
lincoln
mills,
you
said
that,
that
the
federal
government
had
jurisdiction
regardless
of
diversity.
and
we
come
on
down
from
that
to
whole
a
lot
of
other
cases
which
i
think
are
perfectly
properly
saying
that
when
you
have
a
national
labor
policy
and
the
courts
are
going
to
be
obligated
to
implement
it
and
they're
going
to
be
obligated
to
decide
cases
under
it,
you
come
to
the
question
of
whether
that
national
labor
policy
should
be
governed
by
strictly
federal
law
as
enunciated
by
the
federal
courts
or
whether
in
certain
places
it
should
be
governed
by
the
state
law.
now
in
the
past,
it
has
been
regarded
in
this
fashion
that
if
it's
wrongful
discharged,
it's
outside
of
a
concept
of
the
federal
labor
laws,
totally
outside
of
the
concept
of
the
federal
labor
laws,
when
the
man
is
fired
and
gone,
and
therefore,
the
state
law
should
control.
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
law
was
applied
by
the
district
court
to
give
me
a
recovery.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
that's
quite
true.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
that's
quite
truth.
the
body
of
law,
the
cont
--
the
issues,
the
controlling
body
of
law
whether
it's
federal
law
or
not.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
you
--
it's
not
just
the
form
because
all
of
the
states
have
different
laws
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
--
as
we
for
wrongful
discharged,
so
if
unless
the
federal
government
makes
a
federal
law
regarding
labor
policy.
you
will
have
a
hodgepodge
of
decisions
in
the
state
for
that.
now,
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
this
that
whether
you
say
the
state
law
should
apply
which
in
this
case
gave
walker
right
to
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged,
or
whether
you
say
that
the
federal
law
therefore
the
federal
courts
should
enunciate
a
labor
policy
in
this
connection
and
write
federal
law.
i
think
either
way
you
go,
a
man
who
is
wrongfully
discharged
should
have
a
right
to
come
to
court
whether
it
be
a
federal
court
under
federal
law
or
whether
it
be
a
state
court
under
state
law,
or
whether
it
be
a
federal
court
applying
state
law.
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
from
a
railroad
or
any
other
thing,
he
should
have
a
right
to
come
to
court
for
these
reasons.
the
interest
of
the
individual
union
member
and
the
interest
of
the
union
are
not
merely
identical.
unions
or
organizations
of
people,
they
have
sources
of
power.
they
have
elections.
personalities
get
involved.
one
man
may
run
and
benefit
to
change
the
finding
and
the
only
place
he
can
go
is
to
a
board
where
the
company
and
the
union
are
equal.
and
the
union,
don't
want
him
and
the
company
don't
want
him,
he
has
no
place
to
go
for
justice.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
no,
sir.
i
think
the
difference
is
i
don't
say
that
you
shouldn't
go.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don't
say
that
you
shouldn't
go
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
for
everything
except
wrongful
discharged.
but
i
say
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
he
is
severed
from
his
union.
he
is
totally
cut
loose
from
him
and
they
have
no
further
interest
any.
the
people
that
they
put
on
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board
have
no
further
interest
any.
the
company
that
finally
has
no
further
interests
any.
he
is
at
a
board
which
is
controlled
by
people
who
no
longer
want
him.
now
if
i
--
by
accident,
we
cut
it
in
this
case
to
show
that
the
union
didn't
want
it,
they
sacrificed
it.
they
might
--
we
might
have
been
sacrificed
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
maddox?
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that's
the
distinction.
i
think
in
the
maddox
case
that
what
you
did
actually
was
ask
the
company
to
perform
a
contract.
you
ask
the
company
--
maddox
asked
the
company
to
perform
a
contract.
he
said,
“pay
me
the
severance
pay.”
it
was
the
same
thing
as
he
would
say
put
me
back
to
work.
he
asked
for
performance
of
a
contract.
he
didn't
say
that
you
have
fired
me
wrongfully.
he
didn't
contend
he
was
wrongfully
fired.
the
company
had
every
right
to
close
the
mill.
the
only
obligation
they
had
to
do
was
pay
him
severance
pay.
and
therefore
when
they
were
paying
him
severance
pay,
he
was
actually
asking
for
performance
of
the
contract.
there's
a
lot
difference
in
performance
of
the
contract
in
severance
pay
and
a
suit
for
wrongful
discharged.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
overruled
moore.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
that
is
only
one
of
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
am
urging
another
position
here.
if
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
state
law
no
longer
controls
cases
for
wrongful
discharged.
and
that,
under
the
lincoln
mills
case,
it's
the
obligation
of
the
federal
courts
to
enunciate
a
policy
of
law
about
wrongful
discharged,
then
i'm
saying
even
if
you
overrule
moore
to
that
extent
that
the
federal
courts
should
say,
“that
we
are
picking
up,”
at
it
is
said
in
lincoln
mills,
“we
are
picking
up
state
law.
we're
making
it
federal
law
and
this
is
the
federal
law
but
the
federal
law
is.”
that
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
does
not
ask
for
reinstatement.
he
has
a
right
to
come
into
the
courts
of
his
country
and
sue
the
man
who
wrongfully
discharged
him.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
under
federal
law.
i
don't
care
whether
it's
federal
law
or
state
law.
but
i
think
whether
you
apply
the
state
law
or
whether
you
enunciate
a
body
of
federal
law
that
a
man
should
have
a
right
to
do
that.
there
are
thousands
of
people
working
in
america
today
for
big
companies
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
i
think
maddox
is
a
suit
for
performance
of
a
contract.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
not
abridge.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
am
arguing
both.
in
the
one
hand
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'm
saying
that
maddox
was
not
a
suit
for
wrongful
discharged.
therefore
it
does
not
control
this
case.
and
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
where
you'd
be.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
except
that
i
would
say
this
that,
i
don't
think
anybody
should
be
allowed
to
contract
the
way
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i'd
come
to
court.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
eventhough
the
contract
said
he
would
go
to
the
board
for
matters
of
--
if
the
contract
said,
he
would
go
to
the
board
and
that
is
wrongful
discharged.
then
i
would
question
the
validity
of
that
contract
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
because
you
are
contracting
a
way
of
man's
right
to
bring
suit
for
wrongful
discharged
or
breach
of
contract.
i
would
question
the
validity
of
the
contract
no
matter
the
public
policy
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
but
the
statute
in
this
case
does
not
actually
say.
that
is
the
matter
of
wrongful
discharged
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
the
only
problem.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
the
one.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
it's
fine.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
it's
fine.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
they
give
you
the
law
they
want
it
if
you
find
them.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
right.
if
you
had
to
take
it
before
the
board
they
give
you
whatever
law
they
want
to
and
that
law
is
fine.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
now,
the
only
thing
i
really
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
and
as
far
as
this
particular
case
is
there,
i'm
not
saying
because
that
there
was
this
exchange
of
letters
that
the
adjustment
board
would
have
absolutely
gone
against
walker.
but
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
part
of
my
argument
is
that
you
have
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
--
that
--
that
your
adjustment
board
when
you
have
a
man
wrongfully
discharged,
he
has
no
friend
there.
he's
no
longer
member
of
the
union.
he
--
he
no
longer
works
for
the
company
and
there
so
many
interest
between
labor
members
and
labor
unions
that
are
not
identical.
when
you
put
him
into
the
adjustment
board,
you
start
to
put
in
the
hands
of
the
unions,
and
if
they
don't
like
him
or
they
want
to
get
rid
of
him
for
some
reasons.
they
got
no
rules
of
evidence.
they
have
to
go
by
any
rules
of
evidence.
they
have
decisions
to
fire
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
well
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
they
can
take
him
and
go
with
it.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
if
he
said
he
wants
reinstatement
under
your
decisions.
i
think
you
go
to
the
adjustment
board
for
that
part.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
well,
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
right.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
well,
let
me
tell
you
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
union
member.
from
the
point
of
view
of
roy
walker
in
this
case,
they
want
to
use
roy
walker
to
ask
for
reinstatement
because
he
knew
he
want
to
go
get
it.
now,
he
--
the
only
thing
he
could
do
is
come
in
here
and
asked
for
suit
for
damages.
that's
all
he
could
do.
now
take
his
position
in
this
case,
he
work
for
the
southern
railroad
from
1944
until
1957.
he
had
retirement.
he
had
everything.
he
had
it
all
build
up
and
just
because
he
got
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
union
and
the
company,
he's
gone.
and
they
say,
“we
can't
do
anything
about
that.”
now,
this
particular
30-day
period
that
judge
craven
found
for
me.
i
would
have
been
in
bad
shape
before
the
adjustment
board
where
nobody
like
him
on
his
30-day
period
because
the
union
was
contended
that
the
date
of
the
letter
contended
the
30-day
period.
i'd
never
made
it
and
yet
they
run
him
off.
and
i'm
saying
that
that
the
people
work
in
this
country
and
work
for
big
companies
and
belong
to
bi
unions
when
they
are
thrown
out
of
the
--
of
their
job
and
they're
gone
and
they
treat
their
discharged
as
final.
they
ought
to
be
able
to
come
to
an
impartial
federal
court
or
to
an
impartial
state
court
and
get
a
trial
where
their
rights
can
be
protected
by
the
rules
of
evidence
and
under
the
rules
of
law
and
not
relegated
to
an
adjustment
board
which
is
essentially
a
balance
tribunal
rather
than
an
impartial
tribunal.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
moore
essentially
to
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
--
yes,
sir.
i
think
what
moore
said
was
this,
“that
as
far
as
wrongful
discharged
is
concern;
there
was
no
intent
of
congress
to
make
the
railroad
labor
act
company."
that's
what
moore
said.
when
you
got
wrongful
discharged,
there's
no
intent
to
cover.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
this
act
as
stated
in
the
railway
labor
act.
they
say
that
pretty
well.
the
purposes
of
the
chapter
are
to
avoid
any
interruption
of
commerce
or
to
the
operation
of
any
carry
and
it
goes
on
to
provide
for
the
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes
could
turn
in
rates
to
pay,
rooms.
working
conditions
to
provide
for
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes
going
out
of
grievances
interpretation
and
application
of
agreements,
rates
are
paid
in
working
conditions.
i
think
the
railway
labor
act
contemplated
and
i
think
moore
recognized
that
it
contemplates.
a
situation
where
the
man
was
to
go
to
continue
to
be
an
employee,
a
situation
that
involve
the
transportation
policy,
a
situation
where
they
were
involve
in
what
are
you
going
to
do
today.
are
you
coming
to
work
at
this
time,
is
this
rule
going
to
govern
you?
how
many
days
do
you
have
to
report?
what
did
you
send
in
the
letter
when
you're
sick?
this
is
what
the
railway
labor
act
was
intended
to
cover
and
i
think
moore
said
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
not
intended
to
cover
wrongful
discharged.
and
therefore
you
can
bring
your
action
in
the
state
court
because
it
is
not
yet
petition
in
the
congress
to
cover.
but
my
principal
point
in
this
case
is
whether
you
say
that
the
railway
labor
act
should
be
construed
under
state
law
or
the
federal
law,
whether
you
say
it
intended
to
do
this
or
not.
it
is
a
matter
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
protection
for
the
individual.
when
a
man
working
for
a
big
company
is
fine
and
the
union
don't
like
it
either
you
ought
to
have
some
place
to
go.
and
if
you
hold
that
he's
got
to
go
to
this
adjustment
board,
he
is
just
--
he
just
roy
walker's
lost.
he's
too
old.
he
can't
get
another
job.
he's
got
no
retirement.
he's
got
nothing;
he's
speaking
about
keeping
that
bank.
and
a
federal
court
said,
“you
wrongfully
discharged
him.”
and
they
say,
“well,
you
couldn't
go
to
a
federal
court.
we
wrongfully
discharged
him
but
you
couldn't
(inaudible).”
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
oh,
gracious.
it's
to
writ
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
oh,
it
takes
a
long
time
sir.
the
last
that
i
heard
was
seven
to
eight
years.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
it
should
have
taken
as
long
to
get
up
here
by
having
this
maneuver
in
the
trial
court
down
there.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
he's
in
his
60s,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
thank
you
sir.
i'll
save
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
justice
fortas
in
answer
to
question
about,
who
would
have
been
in
this
board,
it
would
have
been
the
fifth
division.
to
have
jurisdiction
over
disputes
involving
train
yard
service
employees,
carriers,
engineers,
primary
holds
and
outside
helpers.
the
divisions
shall
consist
of
10
members.
five
of
whom
shall
be
selected
and
designated
by
the
carriers
and
five
of
whom
shall
be
selected
and
designated
by
the
national
labor
organization
of
the
employees.
his
union
would
have
had
five
people
on
that
board,
as
to
the
board.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that's
brotherhood
of
railway
trainmen.
now
in
the
central
airlines
case,
i
think
that
differs
from
the
other
cases
here.
in
central
airlines,
the
man
went
to
the
board
and
had
reinstatement
order
and
the
company
refused
to
reinstatement
him.
he
had
invoked
the
federal
law.
had
reinstatement
order
so
there
was
nothing
the
federal
court
could
do
but
ordered
the
company
to
comply.
and
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
in
the
central
airlines
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
court.
i'd
like
to
review
for
just
a
moment
the
factual
situation
in
this
case.
roy
walker
was
employed
by
the
southern
railroad
sometime
in
1944.
in
--
on
march
3,
1957,
he
was
informed
that
he
had
been
displaced
by
an
employee
with
greater
seniority.
he
then
informed
the
call
clerk
that
he
was
sick
and
was
going
home.
he
went
home
and
on
april
the
29th,
a
letter
was
directed
to
him
to
report
for
duty.
in
between
these
times,
it
was
contended
by
mr.
walker
that
he
had
informed
the
railroad
of
his
illness.
this
record
said,
“dear
sir,
i
understand
you
were
displaced
from
the
regular
job
at
airline
junction
march
3,
1957
and
i
was
yourself
since?
this
is
to
advise
you
that
you
stand
for
work
in
your
seniority
and
unless
you
protect
your
seniority
standing
within
30
days
from
the
date
of
this
letter,
you
will
have
opted
your
seniority.
yours
very
truly,
superintendent.”
that
letter
was
dated
april
the
29th
in
greenville,
south
carolina.
it
was
signed
for
may
the
30th
by
mr.
walker's
daughter.
he
was
on
the
hospital
at
the
time
and
didn't
have
knowledge
of
it
for
four
days.
he
then
went
down
on
may
the
29th
to
report
for
duty
and
discovered
that
his
name
had
been
stricken
from
the
seniority
list
because
he
had
not
reported
in
30
days.
this
is
actually
the
turning
point
of
the
wrongfulness
of
the
discharged.
they
told
him
he
couldn't
go
to
work
that
he
had
been
fired.
he
went
to
see
the
superintendent
the
next
day.
the
superintendent
of
that
division,
mr.
brad
and
in
this
connection,
there
has
been
some
suggestion
here
that
taken
a
man's
seniority
doesn't
fire
him,
if
this
is
just
a
grievance
or
some
technical
situation?
well,
the
day
after
he
reported
and
was
told
that
his
seniority
was
taken.
the
superintendent
of
the
railroad
wrote
him
this
letter,
he
reported
this
letter
was
written
to
him
on
the
--
on
the
--
“please
refer
to
my
letter
dated
april
the
29,
1957,
advising
you
to
protect
your
seniority
within
30
days.
you
did
not
report
and
protect
your
seniority
as
instructed
and
this
is
stood
by
you
that
under
the
provisions
of
fireman's
agreement
and
so
forth.
your
name
has
been
stricken
from
the
firemen
seniority
list
and
you
are
no
longer
considered
an
employee
of
the
southern
railroad.
please
turn
in
all
company
property
you
have
in
your
possession
to
train
met
--
to
terminal
train
master
curly.
now,
there's
no
question
i
think
that
roy
walker
was
fired
and
he
was
fired
because
the
railroad
said
he
didn't
protect
his
seniority
within
30
days.
we
tried
this
case
in
the
western
district
court
before
judge
craven
and
judge
craven
found
this
fact.
walker
reported
for
work
on
may
29,
1957,
it
is
adjudged
that
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
30-day
period
within
which
he
was
required
to
report.
southern
for
job
his
seniority
as
of
may
28,
1957
was
therefore
unlawful
and
constituted
a
violation
of
his
contract.
so
we
have
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
we
tried
it
before
judge
craven
to
the
effect
that
walker
was
wrongfully
discharged.
now
then
at
this
juncture,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
thing
i
refer
to
it
again
later.
later
on
that
year
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
eight
days
before
the
maddox
decision.
yes,
sir.
now
then
later
on
that
summer,
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
between
mr.
l.g.
tolleson,
who
is
director
of
labor
relations
of
the
southern
railway,
and
mr.
r.l.
mccollan,
general
chairman
of
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
engineers.
these
letters
are
printed
in
the
appendix
for
my
brief
--
to
my
brief
because
by
early
were
not
included
in
the
printed
records.
to
make
the
long
story
short,
mr.
tolleson
writes
to
mr.
mccollan
in
my
exhibit
3
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
and
after
he
goes
through
the
whole
discussion,
he
says
in
next
to
the
last
paragraph
about
the
middle
of
paragraph.
this
is
a
railroad
writing
to
the
union
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
this
is
the
railroad
writing
to
the
union
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
--
director
of
rail
--
director
of
labor
relations
writing
to
the
union,
“your
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
the
doctor
has
use
a
history
which
i
believe
he
will
agree
anyone
will
interpret
as
meaning
that
walker
was
unable
to
work
during
the
period
he
was
off.
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
related
above,
will
you
please
advise
promptly
what
your
position
is?”
the
labor
union
asked
the
railroad.
here
is
what
the
general
chairman
of
mr.
walker's
union
wrote
in
response
to
that
letter.
it's
the
second
letter
in
the
appendix
and
then
its
exhibit
4.
“dear
mr.
tolleson.
referring
to
your
letter
of
august
23,
1957,
concerning
the
seniority
of
fireman
r.e.
walker
charlotte
division
north,
your
file.
this
matter
was
discussed
with
you
while
in
washington
september
the
11th.
you
requested
that
i
write
you
concerning
my
position
to
the
matter.
as
i
explain
to
you
in
commerce,
it
does
not
matter
with
the
organization
whether
this
man
is
returned
to
service
or
not.
this
is
the
general
chairman
of
the
union
who
should
be
expected
to
protect
mr.
walker
and
to
help
him
and
at
the
end
of
that
letter
he
said,
“considering
the
circumstances
in
this
case
and
the
claimant's
previous
record.
it
would
appear
that
the
best
action
to
take
would
be
to
let
the
matter
rested
it
is
with
fireman
walker's
name
removed
from
seniority
list.”
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
considering
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
claimant's
previous
record,
it
would
appear
that
the
best
action
to
take
would
be
to
let
the
matter
rest
as
it
is
with
fireman
walker's
name
removed
from
the
list.
so
we
have
here
actually,
the
union
that
mr.
walker
paid
his
dues
to
that
he
relied
upon
saying
to
the
director
of
labor
relations
of
the
southern
railroad,
i
want
you
to
leave
him
fired
when
the
director
had
suggested
that
he
be
rehired.
now,
mr.
walker
came
to
me
to
know
what
to
do.
he
knew
that
the
general
chairman
of
the
union
didn't
like
him
and
he
knew
that
he
couldn't
get
his
job
back
through
the
union.
we
didn't
have
these
letters
at
the
time.
it
took
a
lot
of
adverse
examinations
before
the
southern
railroad
to
come
up
with
these
two
letters
with
this
exchange
of
letters
between
the
union
and
the
railroad.
and
so,
i
brought
a
notion
in
rather
for
county
court
the
wrongful
discharged
and
ask
for
damages.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
went
six
years
later.
i
brought
it
within
a
three-year
statute.
but
i
had
so
many
motions
to
strike
and
so
many
--
and
so
many
demurrers
and
so
many
procedure
difficulties
in
north
carolina.
we
can
take
a
non-suit
and
bring
the
action
again
within
a
year.
and
rather
in
the
preliminary
skirmishing
of
going
through
the
appeals
and
back
in
appeals
and
back
in
north
carolina,
i
simply
non-suit
in
my
compliant
and
made
it
conform
to
what
the
railroad
said
out
to
have.
and
that's
the
reason
it
looks
like
it
was
six
years
before
we
brought
it.
mr.
walker
came
to
me
and
we
brought
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged.
they
removed
it
to
the
federal
court
and
we
were
successful.
eight
days
after
that,
this
court
decided
the
republic
steel
against
maddox
and
the
railroad
gave
notice
to
the
appeal
to
the
circuit,
and
i
gave
notice
of
appeal
on
matter
of
mitigation
of
damages.
i
think
we
really
come
down
to
this
in
this
case.
the
federal
government
has
a
labor
policy
and
i
think
the
essential
question
is
this.
when
a
discharged
--
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
and
his
discharged
is
treated
by
him
as
fine,
does
that
take
his
case
outside
of
the
purview
of
the
federal
labor
policy?
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
what
makes
it
wrong.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
right.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
what
we're
down
to.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
now
in
the
past,
in
the
moore
cases
and
so
forth,
this
court
had
said
that
you
may
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged,
if
you
want
to?
or
you
may
ask
for
reinstatement?
but
if
you
ask
for
reinstatement
then
you
are
under
the
board
and
if
you
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged
it
does
by
the
common
law?
then
when
we
get
to
that
point,
we
come
here.
if
he
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged,
is
that
action
for
wrongful
discharged
governed
by
the
state
law
or
is
it
governed
by
the
federal
law?
now
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
this
court
there
properly
i
think
said
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
make
a
body
of
law
concerning
labor
relations
because
you
have
labor
acts
and
you
regulate
the
labor,
the
railroads
and
the
other
labor
act
and
it
is
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
make
a
body
of
law
governing
labor
relations
when
the
congress
pays
it
acts
for
that.
and
so
in
lincoln
mills,
you
said
that,
that
the
federal
government
had
jurisdiction
regardless
of
diversity.
and
we
come
on
down
from
that
to
whole
a
lot
of
other
cases
which
i
think
are
perfectly
properly
saying
that
when
you
have
a
national
labor
policy
and
the
courts
are
going
to
be
obligated
to
implement
it
and
they're
going
to
be
obligated
to
decide
cases
under
it,
you
come
to
the
question
of
whether
that
national
labor
policy
should
be
governed
by
strictly
federal
law
as
enunciated
by
the
federal
courts
or
whether
in
certain
places
it
should
be
governed
by
the
state
law.
now
in
the
past,
it
has
been
regarded
in
this
fashion
that
if
it's
wrongful
discharged,
it's
outside
of
a
concept
of
the
federal
labor
laws,
totally
outside
of
the
concept
of
the
federal
labor
laws,
when
the
man
is
fired
and
gone,
and
therefore,
the
state
law
should
control.
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
law
was
applied
by
the
district
court
to
give
me
a
recovery.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
that's
quite
true.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
that's
quite
truth.
the
body
of
law,
the
cont
--
the
issues,
the
controlling
body
of
law
whether
it's
federal
law
or
not.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
you
--
it's
not
just
the
form
because
all
of
the
states
have
different
laws
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
--
as
we
for
wrongful
discharged,
so
if
unless
the
federal
government
makes
a
federal
law
regarding
labor
policy.
you
will
have
a
hodgepodge
of
decisions
in
the
state
for
that.
now,
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
this
that
whether
you
say
the
state
law
should
apply
which
in
this
case
gave
walker
right
to
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
discharged,
or
whether
you
say
that
the
federal
law
therefore
the
federal
courts
should
enunciate
a
labor
policy
in
this
connection
and
write
federal
law.
i
think
either
way
you
go,
a
man
who
is
wrongfully
discharged
should
have
a
right
to
come
to
court
whether
it
be
a
federal
court
under
federal
law
or
whether
it
be
a
state
court
under
state
law,
or
whether
it
be
a
federal
court
applying
state
law.
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
from
a
railroad
or
any
other
thing,
he
should
have
a
right
to
come
to
court
for
these
reasons.
the
interest
of
the
individual
union
member
and
the
interest
of
the
union
are
not
merely
identical.
unions
or
organizations
of
people,
they
have
sources
of
power.
they
have
elections.
personalities
get
involved.
one
man
may
run
and
benefit
to
change
the
finding
and
the
only
place
he
can
go
is
to
a
board
where
the
company
and
the
union
are
equal.
and
the
union,
don't
want
him
and
the
company
don't
want
him,
he
has
no
place
to
go
for
justice.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
no,
sir.
i
think
the
difference
is
i
don't
say
that
you
shouldn't
go.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don't
say
that
you
shouldn't
go
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
for
everything
except
wrongful
discharged.
but
i
say
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
he
is
severed
from
his
union.
he
is
totally
cut
loose
from
him
and
they
have
no
further
interest
any.
the
people
that
they
put
on
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board
have
no
further
interest
any.
the
company
that
finally
has
no
further
interests
any.
he
is
at
a
board
which
is
controlled
by
people
who
no
longer
want
him.
now
if
i
--
by
accident,
we
cut
it
in
this
case
to
show
that
the
union
didn't
want
it,
they
sacrificed
it.
they
might
--
we
might
have
been
sacrificed
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
maddox?
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that's
the
distinction.
i
think
in
the
maddox
case
that
what
you
did
actually
was
ask
the
company
to
perform
a
contract.
you
ask
the
company
--
maddox
asked
the
company
to
perform
a
contract.
he
said,
“pay
me
the
severance
pay.”
it
was
the
same
thing
as
he
would
say
put
me
back
to
work.
he
asked
for
performance
of
a
contract.
he
didn't
say
that
you
have
fired
me
wrongfully.
he
didn't
contend
he
was
wrongfully
fired.
the
company
had
every
right
to
close
the
mill.
the
only
obligation
they
had
to
do
was
pay
him
severance
pay.
and
therefore
when
they
were
paying
him
severance
pay,
he
was
actually
asking
for
performance
of
the
contract.
there's
a
lot
difference
in
performance
of
the
contract
in
severance
pay
and
a
suit
for
wrongful
discharged.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
overruled
moore.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
that
is
only
one
of
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
am
urging
another
position
here.
if
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
state
law
no
longer
controls
cases
for
wrongful
discharged.
and
that,
under
the
lincoln
mills
case,
it's
the
obligation
of
the
federal
courts
to
enunciate
a
policy
of
law
about
wrongful
discharged,
then
i'm
saying
even
if
you
overrule
moore
to
that
extent
that
the
federal
courts
should
say,
“that
we
are
picking
up,”
at
it
is
said
in
lincoln
mills,
“we
are
picking
up
state
law.
we're
making
it
federal
law
and
this
is
the
federal
law
but
the
federal
law
is.”
that
when
a
man
is
wrongfully
discharged
does
not
ask
for
reinstatement.
he
has
a
right
to
come
into
the
courts
of
his
country
and
sue
the
man
who
wrongfully
discharged
him.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
under
federal
law.
i
don't
care
whether
it's
federal
law
or
state
law.
but
i
think
whether
you
apply
the
state
law
or
whether
you
enunciate
a
body
of
federal
law
that
a
man
should
have
a
right
to
do
that.
there
are
thousands
of
people
working
in
america
today
for
big
companies
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
i
think
maddox
is
a
suit
for
performance
of
a
contract.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
not
abridge.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
am
arguing
both.
in
the
one
hand
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'm
saying
that
maddox
was
not
a
suit
for
wrongful
discharged.
therefore
it
does
not
control
this
case.
and
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
where
you'd
be.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
except
that
i
would
say
this
that,
i
don't
think
anybody
should
be
allowed
to
contract
the
way
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i'd
come
to
court.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
eventhough
the
contract
said
he
would
go
to
the
board
for
matters
of
--
if
the
contract
said,
he
would
go
to
the
board
and
that
is
wrongful
discharged.
then
i
would
question
the
validity
of
that
contract
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
because
you
are
contracting
a
way
of
man's
right
to
bring
suit
for
wrongful
discharged
or
breach
of
contract.
i
would
question
the
validity
of
the
contract
no
matter
the
public
policy
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
but
the
statute
in
this
case
does
not
actually
say.
that
is
the
matter
of
wrongful
discharged
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
the
only
problem.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
the
one.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
it's
fine.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
it's
fine.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
they
give
you
the
law
they
want
it
if
you
find
them.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
that's
right.
if
you
had
to
take
it
before
the
board
they
give
you
whatever
law
they
want
to
and
that
law
is
fine.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
now,
the
only
thing
i
really
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
and
as
far
as
this
particular
case
is
there,
i'm
not
saying
because
that
there
was
this
exchange
of
letters
that
the
adjustment
board
would
have
absolutely
gone
against
walker.
but
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
part
of
my
argument
is
that
you
have
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
--
that
--
that
your
adjustment
board
when
you
have
a
man
wrongfully
discharged,
he
has
no
friend
there.
he's
no
longer
member
of
the
union.
he
--
he
no
longer
works
for
the
company
and
there
so
many
interest
between
labor
members
and
labor
unions
that
are
not
identical.
when
you
put
him
into
the
adjustment
board,
you
start
to
put
in
the
hands
of
the
unions,
and
if
they
don't
like
him
or
they
want
to
get
rid
of
him
for
some
reasons.
they
got
no
rules
of
evidence.
they
have
to
go
by
any
rules
of
evidence.
they
have
decisions
to
fire
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
well
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
they
can
take
him
and
go
with
it.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
if
he
said
he
wants
reinstatement
under
your
decisions.
i
think
you
go
to
the
adjustment
board
for
that
part.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
well,
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
right.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
well,
let
me
tell
you
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
union
member.
from
the
point
of
view
of
roy
walker
in
this
case,
they
want
to
use
roy
walker
to
ask
for
reinstatement
because
he
knew
he
want
to
go
get
it.
now,
he
--
the
only
thing
he
could
do
is
come
in
here
and
asked
for
suit
for
damages.
that's
all
he
could
do.
now
take
his
position
in
this
case,
he
work
for
the
southern
railroad
from
1944
until
1957.
he
had
retirement.
he
had
everything.
he
had
it
all
build
up
and
just
because
he
got
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
union
and
the
company,
he's
gone.
and
they
say,
“we
can't
do
anything
about
that.”
now,
this
particular
30-day
period
that
judge
craven
found
for
me.
i
would
have
been
in
bad
shape
before
the
adjustment
board
where
nobody
like
him
on
his
30-day
period
because
the
union
was
contended
that
the
date
of
the
letter
contended
the
30-day
period.
i'd
never
made
it
and
yet
they
run
him
off.
and
i'm
saying
that
that
the
people
work
in
this
country
and
work
for
big
companies
and
belong
to
bi
unions
when
they
are
thrown
out
of
the
--
of
their
job
and
they're
gone
and
they
treat
their
discharged
as
final.
they
ought
to
be
able
to
come
to
an
impartial
federal
court
or
to
an
impartial
state
court
and
get
a
trial
where
their
rights
can
be
protected
by
the
rules
of
evidence
and
under
the
rules
of
law
and
not
relegated
to
an
adjustment
board
which
is
essentially
a
balance
tribunal
rather
than
an
impartial
tribunal.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
think
moore
essentially
to
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
i
--
yes,
sir.
i
think
what
moore
said
was
this,
“that
as
far
as
wrongful
discharged
is
concern;
there
was
no
intent
of
congress
to
make
the
railroad
labor
act
company."
that's
what
moore
said.
when
you
got
wrongful
discharged,
there's
no
intent
to
cover.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
this
act
as
stated
in
the
railway
labor
act.
they
say
that
pretty
well.
the
purposes
of
the
chapter
are
to
avoid
any
interruption
of
commerce
or
to
the
operation
of
any
carry
and
it
goes
on
to
provide
for
the
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes
could
turn
in
rates
to
pay,
rooms.
working
conditions
to
provide
for
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes
going
out
of
grievances
interpretation
and
application
of
agreements,
rates
are
paid
in
working
conditions.
i
think
the
railway
labor
act
contemplated
and
i
think
moore
recognized
that
it
contemplates.
a
situation
where
the
man
was
to
go
to
continue
to
be
an
employee,
a
situation
that
involve
the
transportation
policy,
a
situation
where
they
were
involve
in
what
are
you
going
to
do
today.
are
you
coming
to
work
at
this
time,
is
this
rule
going
to
govern
you?
how
many
days
do
you
have
to
report?
what
did
you
send
in
the
letter
when
you're
sick?
this
is
what
the
railway
labor
act
was
intended
to
cover
and
i
think
moore
said
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
not
intended
to
cover
wrongful
discharged.
and
therefore
you
can
bring
your
action
in
the
state
court
because
it
is
not
yet
petition
in
the
congress
to
cover.
but
my
principal
point
in
this
case
is
whether
you
say
that
the
railway
labor
act
should
be
construed
under
state
law
or
the
federal
law,
whether
you
say
it
intended
to
do
this
or
not.
it
is
a
matter
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
protection
for
the
individual.
when
a
man
working
for
a
big
company
is
fine
and
the
union
don't
like
it
either
you
ought
to
have
some
place
to
go.
and
if
you
hold
that
he's
got
to
go
to
this
adjustment
board,
he
is
just
--
he
just
roy
walker's
lost.
he's
too
old.
he
can't
get
another
job.
he's
got
no
retirement.
he's
got
nothing;
he's
speaking
about
keeping
that
bank.
and
a
federal
court
said,
“you
wrongfully
discharged
him.”
and
they
say,
“well,
you
couldn't
go
to
a
federal
court.
we
wrongfully
discharged
him
but
you
couldn't
(inaudible).”
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
oh,
gracious.
it's
to
writ
--
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
oh,
it
takes
a
long
time
sir.
the
last
that
i
heard
was
seven
to
eight
years.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
it
should
have
taken
as
long
to
get
up
here
by
having
this
maneuver
in
the
trial
court
down
there.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
he's
in
his
60s,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
thank
you
sir.
i'll
save
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
justice
fortas
in
answer
to
question
about,
who
would
have
been
in
this
board,
it
would
have
been
the
fifth
division.
to
have
jurisdiction
over
disputes
involving
train
yard
service
employees,
carriers,
engineers,
primary
holds
and
outside
helpers.
the
divisions
shall
consist
of
10
members.
five
of
whom
shall
be
selected
and
designated
by
the
carriers
and
five
of
whom
shall
be
selected
and
designated
by
the
national
labor
organization
of
the
employees.
his
union
would
have
had
five
people
on
that
board,
as
to
the
board.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
mr.
j.
nat
hamrick
yes,
sir.
that's
brotherhood
of
railway
trainmen.
now
in
the
central
airlines
case,
i
think
that
differs
from
the
other
cases
here.
in
central
airlines,
the
man
went
to
the
board
and
had
reinstatement
order
and
the
company
refused
to
reinstatement
him.
he
had
invoked
the
federal
law.
had
reinstatement
order
so
there
was
nothing
the
federal
court
could
do
but
ordered
the
company
to
comply.
and
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
in
the
central
airlines
case.
thank
you
very
much.
