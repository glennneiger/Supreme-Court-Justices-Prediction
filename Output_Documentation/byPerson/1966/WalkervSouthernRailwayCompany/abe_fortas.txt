justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
point
that
the
railway
of
adjustment
board
is
a
board
composed
of
unions
and
representatives
and
company
representatives
or
it
would
be
unfair
to
affirm
to
that
as
distinguish
from
the
nlrb
which
is
an
administrative
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
the
way
it
--
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
distinguished
madison
--
justice
abe
fortas
maddox.
justice
abe
fortas
does
any
difference
between
your
case
and
the
moore
against
illinois
central
railroad?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
only
question
is
whether
maddox
has
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
overruled
moore?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule?
are
you
saying
that
we
ought
to
overrule
maddox
with
respect
to
non-railway
labor
employees?
or
they
ought
to
narrow
maddox
down
to
which
you
say
its
precise
holding?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
are
two
probable
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
bases
as
i
see
it
for
your
case
here
and
i'm
getting
a
little
lost
in
my
own
call.
one
of
them
is
say
that
this
is
railway
labor,
it's
covered
by
different
statutes
etcetera
and
maddox
was
nlrb,
its
one
approach
to
this.
the
other
approach
to
this
is
to
say,
right
before
argument
in
a
way
that
maddox
--
does
control
of
maddox
show
some
a
confinement
of
moore,
moore
against
ic
railroad.
and
that
although
there's
no
difference
in
fact
that
this
is
railway
labor
act
and
not
nlrb,
and
nevertheless
maddox
should
be
confined
to
its
precise
holding?
justice
abe
fortas
so
those
are
two
different
lines
of
argument
then
i
don't
suggest
that
necessarily
inconsistent
and
that
you
can
argue
both
and
i
would
like
to
know
whether
you
are
arguing
both?
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
icc
represented
on
the
division
of
the
labor
board
before
which
this
would
go?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
the
illinois
central,
ic?
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
whether
this
particular
union
has
one
of
its
own
officers
from
that
division?
justice
abe
fortas
okay.
it's
kind
of
a
circular
argument
though,
isn't
it
because
if
federal
law
applies
then
and
you
ought
to
be
in
the
railway
labor
board.
if
a
--
if
a
state
law
applies
then
it
ought
to
be
in
the
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
–
so
that
it
doesn't
help
you
to
argue
state
or
federal
law
here?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
that's
why
the
question
here
is
they
voted
the
railway
labor
board
or
don't.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
no
--
not
that
issue
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
of
these?
justice
abe
fortas
is

your
