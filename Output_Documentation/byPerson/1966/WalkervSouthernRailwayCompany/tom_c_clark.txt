no,
except
that
you
don't
really
--
you're
saying
that
the
adjustment
board,
no
disinterested
party
comes
in
the
adjustment
board
and
that's
the
disagreement
between
management
and
the
union.
so
the
union
amends
having
already
voted
with
both
that
way
again.
except
that
this
union
might
not
even
be
represented
on
the
adjustment
board.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
true?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
may
i
--
when
you
say
federal
or
state
laws
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
isn't
it
really
only
what
forum
he
goes
to?
whether
he
has
to
go
to
the
board
or
there's
no
question
here,
is
he
suppose
to
go
to
the
court?
i
mean
if
he
may
go
to
courts,
is
there
any
question
here
whether
state
or
federal
substantive
law
would
apply?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
but
moore
has
a
state
law
applies.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
wonder
if
that
follows
on.
if
this
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
congress
has
let
these
things
sit
the
way
it
has
ever
since
moore
was
decided
and
you
can't
distinguish
this
from
moore,
i
just
wonder
if
there's
anything
more
here
than
what
was
going
to
overrule
moore
or
not.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
in
that
respect,
if
maddox
differs
in
policy
approach,
will
also
got
involved
here.
the
old
principle
that
you
don't
overrule
statutory
construction
decision
of
congress
(inaudible),
they
have
been
into
do
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
may
be
brought
--
this
may
be
very
true
and
probably
is.
but
isn't
there
also
involved
that
this
--
moore
was
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
don't
you
have
also
the
principle
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
overrule
decisions
with
symbolic
statutory
construction
that
congress
can
--
and
change
if
he
wants
to
and
this
instance
has
not?
justice
tom
c.

no,
