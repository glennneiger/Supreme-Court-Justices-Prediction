mr.
thormund
a.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
begin
our
analysis
by
examining
the
congressional
expressions
of
public
policy
directly
relating
to
coordination
of
motor
and
rail
service.
we
maintain
that
rules
2
and
3
are
unlawful
because
they
permit
a
motor
carrier
to
perform
its
authorized
service
by
utilizing
rail
service
under
a
tariff
open
to
ordinary
shippers.
part
ii,
the
provisions
of
part
ii
of
the
act,
interstate
commerce
act,
requires
a
motor
carrier
to
perform
its
authorized
service
by
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway.
common
in
contract
carriers
since
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
act
are
entities
created
by
the
act,
their
authority
is
defined
by
the
act.
the
certificate
and
permit
provisions
of
section
206
(a)
(1)
and
209
(a)
(1)
defined
the
operations
or
business
referred
to
as
that
of
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway.
the
definition
of
a
motor
vehicle
under
203
(a)
(13)
in
the
act
refers
to
vehicle
or
trailer
used
on
highways.
not
only
does
the
act
affirmatively
describe
a
motor
carrier's
operations
in
this
respect,
it
also
negatively
states
that
a
motor
vehicle
does
not
include
any
vehicle
or
car
operated
exclusively
on
rail.
accordingly,
a
grant
of
authority
to
a
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
specifically
excludes
by
definition
the
use
of
a
vehicular
car
operated
exclusively
on
rail
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
the
essential
element
i
think
that
distinguishes
that,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
by
consent
they
become
partners
in
the
provision
of
the
joint
service
and
in
the
necessary
tariffs
held
out
to
the
shipper,
they
both
come
to
him
and
say
we
have
a
combination
of
a
motor
and
a
rail
service,
so
the
motor
carrier
in
that
circumstance
is
not
performing
its
authorized
service
on
a
railroad.
they
are
partners
performing
a
joint
service
and
this
was
provided
specifically
by
permission
of
section
216
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes
sir,
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes,
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
use
a
ferry?
its
routes
are
defined
in
the
course
of
issuing
its
certificate.
we
have
cited
in
our
case
to
illustrate
this
point,
a
certificate
that
authorized
operations
by
ferry
across
the
hudson
river
and
the
lincoln
tubes
have
been
constructed
since
that
time
and
the
--
the
holding
in
the
case
was
that
the
certificate
did
not
include
the
right
to
deviate
from
the
particular
routes
that
were
included.
now,
if
the
certificate
has
specified
a
given
highway
and
there
was
a
ferry
linked
in
that
highway,
i
would
assume
that
the
certificate
authorized
the
use
of
that
ferry.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
that's
correct.
the,
we
are
resting
on
--
on
the
definition
of
the
--
that
arises
from
the
statute.
now,
we
have
both
in
the
new
haven
case
and
in
this
case,
the
commission's
agreement
that
a
flatcar
is
--
is
a
rail
car
and
that
piggyback
operations
on
that
flatcar
is
a
rail
service.
rules
2
and
3
purport
to
allow
carriers
by
motor
vehicle
to
utilize
a
car
operated
exclusively
on
rails
in
the
performance
of
its
authorized
service.
and
we
say
this
is
contrary
to
the
plain
meaning
of
these
authority
and
definitional
provisions
to
the
part
ii
of
the
act.
now,
there
are
three
different
but
interrelated
lines
of
cases
that
confirm
our
interpretation
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act.
one
i'll
call
the
acme
line
of
cases
arising
from
applications
for
grandfather
rights.
the
second
is
the
substituted
freight
service
line
of
cases
dealing
with
request
or
arrangements
in
which
one
mode
substitutes
the
service
of
another
mode.
the
third
line
of
cases
reached
this
court
in
the
parker
case
in
326
u.s.
where
railroads
made
applications
for
limited,
auxiliary
and
supplemental
motor
carrier
rights.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
return
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
towards
the
close
of
our
thursday
argument
concerning
the
relationship
of
a
ferry
operation
to
our
contention
that
a
motor
carrier
must
operate
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway.
ferries
are
exempted
from
part
iii
dealing
with
water
carriers
under
section
303
(g)
(2)
unless
the
commission
finds
that
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
they
should
be
made
subject
to
part
iii.
our
exploration
of
that
turns
up
no
action
by
the
commission
to
make
them
an
ordinary
ferry
subject
to
part
iii
regulation.
in
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
am
proceeding
to
get
them
out
from
under
the
regulation
under
part
iii
and
then
go
to
their
position
as
operating
over
the
public
highways
if
a
ferry
is
considered
a
part
of
a
public
highway
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it's
not
subject
to
regulation
as
a
water
carrier.
and
we
have
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
st.
clair
county
versus
interstate
transport
company,
192
u.s.
454
language
quoted
approvingly
by
the
court
at
page
466
that
a
ferry
is
a
continuation
of
the
highway
from
one
side
of
the
water
over
which
it
passes
to
the
other
and
that
consequently
an
ordinary
ferry
and
i'm
distinguishing
that
from
a
railroad
car
ferry
or
something
of
this
nature
is
considered
a
part
of
the
public
highway
system
unless
the
commission
for
some
reason
concludes
that
it
constitutes
a
line
hole
water
movement
subject
to
part
iii.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
we
were
trying
to
establish
mr.
justice
black
whether
or
not
a
ferry
operation
over
an
ordinary
river
crossing
would
be
a
part
of
the
public
highway
system
so
as
to
become
a
part
of
the
operations
of
a
motor
carrier
over
a
public
highway
pursuant
to
part
ii
of
the
act
where
its
authorized
service
is
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
over
a
public
highway
and
the
--
i
think
the
question
went
to
the
definition
of
a
public
highway
as
embracing
or
not
embracing
the
operations
over
an
ordinary
ferry.
and
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i'm
not
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i'm
not
familiar
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
i'm
sorry
sir
that
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
our
finding
with
respect
to
the
decisions
of
the
commission
and
the
courts
until
the
case
at
bar
has
been
at
operations
of
a
common
or
a
contract
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
within
the
meaning
of
part
ii
do
not
include
the
use
of
other
carriers,
rail,
water
or
motor
under
their
open
tariffs
and
the
first
line
of
cases
that
arose,
came
up
under
the
grandfather
provisions
of
the
act
where
one
of
the
crucial
issues
was
whether
purchased
transportations
from
other
modes
constituted
the
operations
of
a
motor
vehicle
over
the
public
highways
and
the
commission
and
the
courts
until
the
case
of
bar
had
held
uniformly
that
it
did
not.
the
issue
here
is
similar
that
is
whether
or
not
the
purchased
transportation
from
a
railroad
in
tofc
operations
constitutes
the
operations
of
a
motor
vehicle
over
the
public
highways.
this
line
of
cases
begins
with
the
acme
fast
freight
litigation
which
we
have
reviewed
in
our
brief.
there,
a
forwarder
operation
was
conducted
in
part
by
operating
motor
vehicles
directly
by
the
forwarder
and
in
part
by
the
purchase
of
transportation
from
rails,
water
and
motor
carriers.
it
was
held
by
division
5
of
the
commission
and
later
by
a
full
commission
decision
by
commissioner
eastman
that
the
authority
of
the
motor
carrier
was
limited
to
operations
by
motor
vehicle
upon
the
public
highway
and
they
granted
the
grandfather
right
certificate
only
as
to
those
portions
of
the
operation
which
they
prove
they
were
actually
conducting
themselves
on
the
public
highways.
the
reviewing
court
said
flatly
that
a
forwarding
company
could
hardly
be
in
operations
on
a
public
highway
when
it
contracts
for
transportation
there
by
independent
connecting
carriers.
this
court
affirmed
the
acme
decision
in
309
u.s.
and
it
has
been
followed
in
four
other
court
cases
involving
grandfather
rights,
three
of
which
have
been
affirmed
by
this
court.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
there
are
three
--
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
but
i
think
i
can
instance
three.
one
is
that
these
rules
have
an
anticompetitive
effect.
that
is
if
we
published
a
reduced
tofc
rate
for
the
specific
purpose
of
bringing
business
to
the
railroads
in
tofc
service
and
under
rules
2
and
3,
that
rate
becomes
automatically
available
to
our
competitors.
the
goal
of
competition
is
certainly
blunted.
the
--
a
second
reason
is
that
under
the
rules,
under
certain
of
the
plans
where
we
publish
our
rates
for
the
provision
of
equipment,
our
equipment
would
become
available
to
our
competitors.a
substantial
amount
of
business
is
rooted
by
shippers,
by
those
carriers
which
protect
them
in
the
provision
of
equipment.here,
we
would
be
sharing
our
equipment
under
our
obligation
to
provide
nondiscriminatory
service
not
only
to
our
ordinary
shippers
but
to
our
competitors.
third
reason
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
its
tariffs
--
let
me
use
this
as
an
illustration.
if
it
were
to
employ
a
plan
iii
service
which
embraces
rail
tofc
service
from
ramp
to
ramp,
the
motor
carrier's
tariff
could
be
at
a
higher
level
if
it
embraced
the
additional
pick
up
and
delivery
service
or
other
services
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i
believe,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
the
motor
carrier
publishes
a
tariff
for
movement
from
points
a
to
b,
and
under
rules
2
and
3
elects
to
move
that
shipment
in
part
by
the
use
of
rail
tofc
service.
it
would
charge
the
shipper
the
same
rate
as
it
would
if
it
had
moved
it
directly
all
the
way
by
highway.
does
that
reach
the
illustration
that
you
have
in
mind?
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i
would
assume
that
if
the
arrangement
is
made
independently
by
the
shipper
with
the
motor
carrier
for
movement
from
the
railhead
to
the
cannery,
the
tariff
charge
would
have
to
be
the
same
regardless
of
whether
it
was
an
ongoing
movement
having
had
a
prior
rail
haul
as
compared
with
the
shipment
originating
at
that
point
where
the
rail
service
terminated.
the
only
instance
in
which
the
charges
might
differ
would
be
in
circumstances
where
there
was
a
joint
haul
or
a
partnership
arrangement
between
the
motor
carrier
and
the
railroad
in
which
they
had
a
through
route
in
a
joint
rate
and
in
that
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
--
situation,
the
revenue
or
compensation
received
by
the
motor
carrier
might
differ
from
the
local
rate
from
the
railhead
to
the
cannery.
but
otherwise,
apart
from
that,
any
shipment
originating
at
that
point
in
terminating
at
the
cannery,
moving
by
the
motor
carrier,
i
would
assume,
would
be
handled
at
the
same
tariff
charge.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
we
of
course
urge
on
the
court
that
a
through
route
is
established
when
a
motor
carrier
operating
in
its
carrier
capacity
tenders
traffic
to
another
carrier
and
they
jointly
haul
--
they
haul
the
service
through
a
course
of
conduct,
they
give
rise
to
a
through
route.
and
that
we
say,
has
to
be
established
under
voluntary
arrangement
such
as
are
provided
for
in
section
216
(c)
that
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
for
an
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
we
come
back
to
the
definitional
provisions
of
part
ii
in
defining
what
the
authorized
service
of
the
motor
carrier
is
and
you
will
recall
in
defining
a
motor
vehicle,
the
provisions
of
the
act
specifically
exclude
the
use
of
a
car
or
vehicle
operated
exclusively
on
rails.
therefore,
we
argue
that
by
definition,
those
provisions
do
not
permit
the
motor
carrier
to
utilize
a
rail
car
by
purchasing
transportation
from
a
railroad
under
its
open
tariffs
in
the
performance
of
its
authorized
service
under
part
ii
certificate.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
we
have
within
the
internal
areas
an
exemption
which
makes
certain
motor
carrier
operations
in
that
limited
geographical
area
of
part
i
or
an
operation
in
conjunction
with
a
railroad.
therefore,
to
that
extent,
we
are
free
to
establish
the
piggyback
service.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
if
we
extend
beyond
that
and
our
motor
carrier
subsidiary
seeks
authority,
they
have
to
go
to
part
ii
and
get
the
authority
just
as
any
other
motor
carrier
would.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i
would
like
to
mention
three
things
with
respect
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
the
general
arguments
that
have
been
raised.
first,
the
specific
provisions
of
the
act,
of
course,
cannot
be
changed
by
resort
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
therefore,
the
definitions
of
a
motor
vehicle
and
a
motor
carrier
service
cannot
be
amended
by
a
resort
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
secondly,
as
i
mentioned
rules
2
and
3
would
have
an
anticompetitive
effect
and
that
plans
ii,
two
and-a-half,
iii
and
iv
rates
covering
those
services
would
be
available
to
our
competitors
under
rules
2
and
3.
thirdly,
very
broad
assertions
have
been
made
as
to
the
economic
effect
of
these
rules
and
we
believe
that
since
these
rules
were
not
before
the
parties
at
the
time
that
the
fact
finding
stage
of
the
case
was
involved.
there
is
no
record
upon
which
solid
conclusions
can
be
reached
as
to
the
economic
effect
of
the
routes.
thank
you.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
--
section
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
begin
our
analysis
by
examining
the
congressional
expressions
of
public
policy
directly
relating
to
coordination
of
motor
and
rail
service.
we
maintain
that
rules
2
and
3
are
unlawful
because
they
permit
a
motor
carrier
to
perform
its
authorized
service
by
utilizing
rail
service
under
a
tariff
open
to
ordinary
shippers.
part
ii,
the
provisions
of
part
ii
of
the
act,
interstate
commerce
act,
requires
a
motor
carrier
to
perform
its
authorized
service
by
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway.
common
in
contract
carriers
since
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
act
are
entities
created
by
the
act,
their
authority
is
defined
by
the
act.
the
certificate
and
permit
provisions
of
section
206
(a)
(1)
and
209
(a)
(1)
defined
the
operations
or
business
referred
to
as
that
of
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway.
the
definition
of
a
motor
vehicle
under
203
(a)
(13)
in
the
act
refers
to
vehicle
or
trailer
used
on
highways.
not
only
does
the
act
affirmatively
describe
a
motor
carrier's
operations
in
this
respect,
it
also
negatively
states
that
a
motor
vehicle
does
not
include
any
vehicle
or
car
operated
exclusively
on
rail.
accordingly,
a
grant
of
authority
to
a
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
specifically
excludes
by
definition
the
use
of
a
vehicular
car
operated
exclusively
on
rail
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
the
essential
element
i
think
that
distinguishes
that,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
by
consent
they
become
partners
in
the
provision
of
the
joint
service
and
in
the
necessary
tariffs
held
out
to
the
shipper,
they
both
come
to
him
and
say
we
have
a
combination
of
a
motor
and
a
rail
service,
so
the
motor
carrier
in
that
circumstance
is
not
performing
its
authorized
service
on
a
railroad.
they
are
partners
performing
a
joint
service
and
this
was
provided
specifically
by
permission
of
section
216
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes
sir,
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes,
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
use
a
ferry?
its
routes
are
defined
in
the
course
of
issuing
its
certificate.
we
have
cited
in
our
case
to
illustrate
this
point,
a
certificate
that
authorized
operations
by
ferry
across
the
hudson
river
and
the
lincoln
tubes
have
been
constructed
since
that
time
and
the
--
the
holding
in
the
case
was
that
the
certificate
did
not
include
the
right
to
deviate
from
the
particular
routes
that
were
included.
now,
if
the
certificate
has
specified
a
given
highway
and
there
was
a
ferry
linked
in
that
highway,
i
would
assume
that
the
certificate
authorized
the
use
of
that
ferry.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
that's
correct.
the,
we
are
resting
on
--
on
the
definition
of
the
--
that
arises
from
the
statute.
now,
we
have
both
in
the
new
haven
case
and
in
this
case,
the
commission's
agreement
that
a
flatcar
is
--
is
a
rail
car
and
that
piggyback
operations
on
that
flatcar
is
a
rail
service.
rules
2
and
3
purport
to
allow
carriers
by
motor
vehicle
to
utilize
a
car
operated
exclusively
on
rails
in
the
performance
of
its
authorized
service.
and
we
say
this
is
contrary
to
the
plain
meaning
of
these
authority
and
definitional
provisions
to
the
part
ii
of
the
act.
now,
there
are
three
different
but
interrelated
lines
of
cases
that
confirm
our
interpretation
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act.
one
i'll
call
the
acme
line
of
cases
arising
from
applications
for
grandfather
rights.
the
second
is
the
substituted
freight
service
line
of
cases
dealing
with
request
or
arrangements
in
which
one
mode
substitutes
the
service
of
another
mode.
the
third
line
of
cases
reached
this
court
in
the
parker
case
in
326
u.s.
where
railroads
made
applications
for
limited,
auxiliary
and
supplemental
motor
carrier
rights.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
return
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
towards
the
close
of
our
thursday
argument
concerning
the
relationship
of
a
ferry
operation
to
our
contention
that
a
motor
carrier
must
operate
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
highway.
ferries
are
exempted
from
part
iii
dealing
with
water
carriers
under
section
303
(g)
(2)
unless
the
commission
finds
that
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
they
should
be
made
subject
to
part
iii.
our
exploration
of
that
turns
up
no
action
by
the
commission
to
make
them
an
ordinary
ferry
subject
to
part
iii
regulation.
in
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes
sir.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
am
proceeding
to
get
them
out
from
under
the
regulation
under
part
iii
and
then
go
to
their
position
as
operating
over
the
public
highways
if
a
ferry
is
considered
a
part
of
a
public
highway
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it's
not
subject
to
regulation
as
a
water
carrier.
and
we
have
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
st.
clair
county
versus
interstate
transport
company,
192
u.s.
454
language
quoted
approvingly
by
the
court
at
page
466
that
a
ferry
is
a
continuation
of
the
highway
from
one
side
of
the
water
over
which
it
passes
to
the
other
and
that
consequently
an
ordinary
ferry
and
i'm
distinguishing
that
from
a
railroad
car
ferry
or
something
of
this
nature
is
considered
a
part
of
the
public
highway
system
unless
the
commission
for
some
reason
concludes
that
it
constitutes
a
line
hole
water
movement
subject
to
part
iii.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
we
were
trying
to
establish
mr.
justice
black
whether
or
not
a
ferry
operation
over
an
ordinary
river
crossing
would
be
a
part
of
the
public
highway
system
so
as
to
become
a
part
of
the
operations
of
a
motor
carrier
over
a
public
highway
pursuant
to
part
ii
of
the
act
where
its
authorized
service
is
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
over
a
public
highway
and
the
--
i
think
the
question
went
to
the
definition
of
a
public
highway
as
embracing
or
not
embracing
the
operations
over
an
ordinary
ferry.
and
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i'm
not
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i'm
not
familiar
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
i'm
sorry
sir
that
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
our
finding
with
respect
to
the
decisions
of
the
commission
and
the
courts
until
the
case
at
bar
has
been
at
operations
of
a
common
or
a
contract
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
within
the
meaning
of
part
ii
do
not
include
the
use
of
other
carriers,
rail,
water
or
motor
under
their
open
tariffs
and
the
first
line
of
cases
that
arose,
came
up
under
the
grandfather
provisions
of
the
act
where
one
of
the
crucial
issues
was
whether
purchased
transportations
from
other
modes
constituted
the
operations
of
a
motor
vehicle
over
the
public
highways
and
the
commission
and
the
courts
until
the
case
of
bar
had
held
uniformly
that
it
did
not.
the
issue
here
is
similar
that
is
whether
or
not
the
purchased
transportation
from
a
railroad
in
tofc
operations
constitutes
the
operations
of
a
motor
vehicle
over
the
public
highways.
this
line
of
cases
begins
with
the
acme
fast
freight
litigation
which
we
have
reviewed
in
our
brief.
there,
a
forwarder
operation
was
conducted
in
part
by
operating
motor
vehicles
directly
by
the
forwarder
and
in
part
by
the
purchase
of
transportation
from
rails,
water
and
motor
carriers.
it
was
held
by
division
5
of
the
commission
and
later
by
a
full
commission
decision
by
commissioner
eastman
that
the
authority
of
the
motor
carrier
was
limited
to
operations
by
motor
vehicle
upon
the
public
highway
and
they
granted
the
grandfather
right
certificate
only
as
to
those
portions
of
the
operation
which
they
prove
they
were
actually
conducting
themselves
on
the
public
highways.
the
reviewing
court
said
flatly
that
a
forwarding
company
could
hardly
be
in
operations
on
a
public
highway
when
it
contracts
for
transportation
there
by
independent
connecting
carriers.
this
court
affirmed
the
acme
decision
in
309
u.s.
and
it
has
been
followed
in
four
other
court
cases
involving
grandfather
rights,
three
of
which
have
been
affirmed
by
this
court.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
there
are
three
--
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
but
i
think
i
can
instance
three.
one
is
that
these
rules
have
an
anticompetitive
effect.
that
is
if
we
published
a
reduced
tofc
rate
for
the
specific
purpose
of
bringing
business
to
the
railroads
in
tofc
service
and
under
rules
2
and
3,
that
rate
becomes
automatically
available
to
our
competitors.
the
goal
of
competition
is
certainly
blunted.
the
--
a
second
reason
is
that
under
the
rules,
under
certain
of
the
plans
where
we
publish
our
rates
for
the
provision
of
equipment,
our
equipment
would
become
available
to
our
competitors.a
substantial
amount
of
business
is
rooted
by
shippers,
by
those
carriers
which
protect
them
in
the
provision
of
equipment.here,
we
would
be
sharing
our
equipment
under
our
obligation
to
provide
nondiscriminatory
service
not
only
to
our
ordinary
shippers
but
to
our
competitors.
third
reason
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
its
tariffs
--
let
me
use
this
as
an
illustration.
if
it
were
to
employ
a
plan
iii
service
which
embraces
rail
tofc
service
from
ramp
to
ramp,
the
motor
carrier's
tariff
could
be
at
a
higher
level
if
it
embraced
the
additional
pick
up
and
delivery
service
or
other
services
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i
believe,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
the
motor
carrier
publishes
a
tariff
for
movement
from
points
a
to
b,
and
under
rules
2
and
3
elects
to
move
that
shipment
in
part
by
the
use
of
rail
tofc
service.
it
would
charge
the
shipper
the
same
rate
as
it
would
if
it
had
moved
it
directly
all
the
way
by
highway.
does
that
reach
the
illustration
that
you
have
in
mind?
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
yes.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i
would
assume
that
if
the
arrangement
is
made
independently
by
the
shipper
with
the
motor
carrier
for
movement
from
the
railhead
to
the
cannery,
the
tariff
charge
would
have
to
be
the
same
regardless
of
whether
it
was
an
ongoing
movement
having
had
a
prior
rail
haul
as
compared
with
the
shipment
originating
at
that
point
where
the
rail
service
terminated.
the
only
instance
in
which
the
charges
might
differ
would
be
in
circumstances
where
there
was
a
joint
haul
or
a
partnership
arrangement
between
the
motor
carrier
and
the
railroad
in
which
they
had
a
through
route
in
a
joint
rate
and
in
that
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
--
situation,
the
revenue
or
compensation
received
by
the
motor
carrier
might
differ
from
the
local
rate
from
the
railhead
to
the
cannery.
but
otherwise,
apart
from
that,
any
shipment
originating
at
that
point
in
terminating
at
the
cannery,
moving
by
the
motor
carrier,
i
would
assume,
would
be
handled
at
the
same
tariff
charge.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
we
of
course
urge
on
the
court
that
a
through
route
is
established
when
a
motor
carrier
operating
in
its
carrier
capacity
tenders
traffic
to
another
carrier
and
they
jointly
haul
--
they
haul
the
service
through
a
course
of
conduct,
they
give
rise
to
a
through
route.
and
that
we
say,
has
to
be
established
under
voluntary
arrangement
such
as
are
provided
for
in
section
216
(c)
that
--
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
well,
for
an
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
we
come
back
to
the
definitional
provisions
of
part
ii
in
defining
what
the
authorized
service
of
the
motor
carrier
is
and
you
will
recall
in
defining
a
motor
vehicle,
the
provisions
of
the
act
specifically
exclude
the
use
of
a
car
or
vehicle
operated
exclusively
on
rails.
therefore,
we
argue
that
by
definition,
those
provisions
do
not
permit
the
motor
carrier
to
utilize
a
rail
car
by
purchasing
transportation
from
a
railroad
under
its
open
tariffs
in
the
performance
of
its
authorized
service
under
part
ii
certificate.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
we
have
within
the
internal
areas
an
exemption
which
makes
certain
motor
carrier
operations
in
that
limited
geographical
area
of
part
i
or
an
operation
in
conjunction
with
a
railroad.
therefore,
to
that
extent,
we
are
free
to
establish
the
piggyback
service.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
if
we
extend
beyond
that
and
our
motor
carrier
subsidiary
seeks
authority,
they
have
to
go
to
part
ii
and
get
the
authority
just
as
any
other
motor
carrier
would.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
i
would
like
to
mention
three
things
with
respect
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
the
general
arguments
that
have
been
raised.
first,
the
specific
provisions
of
the
act,
of
course,
cannot
be
changed
by
resort
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
therefore,
the
definitions
of
a
motor
vehicle
and
a
motor
carrier
service
cannot
be
amended
by
a
resort
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
secondly,
as
i
mentioned
rules
2
and
3
would
have
an
anticompetitive
effect
and
that
plans
ii,
two
and-a-half,
iii
and
iv
rates
covering
those
services
would
be
available
to
our
competitors
under
rules
2
and
3.
thirdly,
very
broad
assertions
have
been
made
as
to
the
economic
effect
of
these
rules
and
we
believe
that
since
these
rules
were
not
before
the
parties
at
the
time
that
the
fact
finding
stage
of
the
case
was
involved.
there
is
no
record
upon
which
solid
conclusions
can
be
reached
as
to
the
economic
effect
of
the
routes.
thank
you.
mr.
thormund
a.
miller
