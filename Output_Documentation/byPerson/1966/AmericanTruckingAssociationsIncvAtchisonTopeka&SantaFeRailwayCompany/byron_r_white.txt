justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginnane
under
what
authority
did
the
commission
purport
to
proceed
in
its
rulemaking?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
clause
ii
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
section
2
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
expressly
purport
to
invoke
3?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
expressed
authority
does
the
commission
have
to
make
rules
or
--
or
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
interpreted
section
2
as
covering
service
as
well
as
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
--
and
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'll
get
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'll
get
to
your
authority
for
that
composition
under
section
2,
and
you
say
this
court
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
give
me
the
citation
of
where
the
commission
talks
about
section
3?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
--
i
take
it
what
mr.
ginnane
said
that
--
that
in
his
view
the
commission
really
did
rely
on
section
3.
i
suppose,
if
we
disagree
with
that
and
don't
read
it
--
this
court
that
way,
are
we
free
to
affirm
on
section
3
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
free
to
uphold
commission
on
section
3.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
324.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
the
plan
v
arrangement
involved
an
element
of
consent
by
the
railroad,
but
when
you
have
a
joint
arrangement
like
that,
and
i
understand
that
the
property
moves
under
a
bill
of
lading
issued
to
private
service
carrier
to
make
the
movement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
motor
carrier
undertakes
or
at
least
negotiates
with
the
shipper
to
get
it
from
a
to
b
and
he
really
is
issuing
a
bill
of
lading
which
involves
a
rail
shipment.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
if
they
say
it
makes
a
critical
difference
in
terms
of
the
issue
you're
talking
about
if
the
railroad
hasn't
consented?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
--
or
that
--
or
that
it
has
to
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
--
would
3
(1)
--
mr.
shea,
would
3
(1)
permit
a
railroad
to
charge
a
dollar
to
--
a
dollar
to
a
--
or
traffic
which
it
receives
from
its
wholly
owned
trucking
subsidiary
and
charge
$2
for
a
traffic
that
as
we
see
from
an
independent
trucking
establishment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
let's
not
talk
about
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
let's
just
talk
about
3
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
3
(1)
permits
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
violation
of
3
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
here
comes
the
--
at
one
truck
line
comes
up
with
the
--
with
the
--
with
some
--
with
some
trailers
full
of
new
cars
and
wants
them
hauled
to
san
francisco.
and
the
railroad
says,
“sure,
we
will.
we'll
charge
you
a
dollar”.
and
the
next
day,
another
truck
line
comes
up
with
the
same
trailer
and
same
cars
and
they
charged
them
$2
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
the
same
trip.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
say
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
all.
they
say,
“$2
we'll
take
it.
sure!
we'll
charge
you
$2”.
justice
byron
r.
white
3
(1)
is
not
but
something
else
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
section
2
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
isn't
it?
isn't
that
section
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
have
a
proviso,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
--
and
you
would
likewise
say
then
that
the
rail
--
railroad
could
accept
the
traffic
of
the
one
carrier
on
the
first
day,
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary
trucking
establishment
and
wholly
refuse
to
accept
the
traffic
from
an
independent
establishment
the
next
day
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
3
or
2
or
any
other
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
one
other
--
in
connection
with
this
--
in
accepting
the
traffic
from
its
own
wholly
owned
subsidiary
for
transportation
to
san
francisco,
could
it
--
would
it
have
to
do
it
via
the
through
route
or
joint
rate
or
whatever
you
would
call
it
or
would
it
--
or
--
or
could
that
--
or
--
or
--
could
that
truck
--
particular
truck
line
have
an
open
tariff
arrangement
and
make
the
sail
itself
originate
the
traffic
and
utilize
which
device,
is
it
v?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the
only
way
the
--
i
gather,
do
you
think
the
only
way
a
truck
line
can
actually
have
the
authority
to
undertake
the
--
or
to
furnish
part
of
its
service
that
it
undertakes
to
furnish
by
railroad,
the
only
way
it
can
do
that
is
to
have
a
voluntary
agreement
with
the
railroad.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
--
you
mean
a
railroad
if
it's
going
to
do
business,
would
accept
any
traffic
from
a
truck
line
--
from
any
truck
line
would
have
to
do
so
for
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
are
you
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
obligation
under
the
act
--
what
obligation
is
there
in
the
act
that
says
that
the
divisions
have
to
be
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
that
--
you
think
that
--
that
applies
between
--
between
two
different
divisions
between
the
--
between
carriers
--
two
different
sets
of
joint
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
was
just
within
one
joint
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
thomas,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
same
impact
result
to
your
group
of
people,
the
forwarders
if
the
railroads
just
as
a
general
matter
agreed
to
joint
rates
or
through
routes
with
motor
carriers?
i
mean,
wouldn't
--
wholly
aside
from
the
technical,
legal
difference
perhaps
between
as
joint
--
a
consensual
arrangement
like
that
and
a
compulsory
when
the
impact
on
you
would
be
precisely
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
that's
what
i
mean
if
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
do
provide
joint
through
routes,
they
--
to
the
extent
that
they
do,
this
has
a
serious
impact
on
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
agree
--
you
agree
that
regardless
of
the
impact
on
you
that
the
joint
--
the
joint
rate
arrangement,
the
consensual
arrangement
between
the
motor
carrier
and
the
railroad
is
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
but
it
still
has
quite
in
effect
on
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
object
to
the
--
i
would
think
you
would
also
have
some
fear
of
the
railroads,
making
their
own
arrangements
with
just
a
few
carriers
namely
the
ones
we
assume
that
have
some
corporate
connections
and
those
--
and
those
carriers
in
effect
acting
--
those
motor
carriers
in
effect
acting
as
freight
forwarders.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
just
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
impact
is
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
impact
on
you
is
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
economically
to
the
extent
that
they
enter
into
joint
through
rates
that
it
cuts
into
your
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginnane,
isn't
the
--
hasn't
--
isn't
the
commission
--
hasn't
it
changed
his
mind
considerably
about
the
acceptability
of
one
carrier
operating
service
by
another
mode?
hasn't
this
--it
has
indeed.
isn't
this
quite
a
change
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
court
ever
touched
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
--
just
like
they
can
do
with
the
railroads?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
suggestion
that
if
the
railroads
--
that
a
railroad
--
if
it
enters
into
a
joint
rate
with
--
or
through
route
with
one
motor
carrier,
it
must
do
so
with
another
on
the
same
term.
if
that
were
the
law,
there
wouldn't
be
much
problem
here,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
line
--
justice
byron
r.
white
between
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
in
the
example
i
gave,
do
you
think
that
the
act
would
permit
--
216
would
permit
a
--
the
railroads
entering
into
an
arrangement
with
one
carrier
at
--
at
motor
carrier
a
dollar
and
another
motor
carrier
at
$2?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
your
position
is
that
there
--
that
there's
another
section
that
prevents
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
though
that
if
the
railroads
have
an
open
tariff
arrangement
for
the
public
that
section
--
sections
2
and
3
require
that
to
be
available
to
the
truckers
as
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginnane
under
what
authority
did
the
commission
purport
to
proceed
in
its
rulemaking?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
clause
ii
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
section
2
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
expressly
purport
to
invoke
3?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
expressed
authority
does
the
commission
have
to
make
rules
or
--
or
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
interpreted
section
2
as
covering
service
as
well
as
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
--
and
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'll
get
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'll
get
to
your
authority
for
that
composition
under
section
2,
and
you
say
this
court
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
give
me
the
citation
of
where
the
commission
talks
about
section
3?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
--
i
take
it
what
mr.
ginnane
said
that
--
that
in
his
view
the
commission
really
did
rely
on
section
3.
i
suppose,
if
we
disagree
with
that
and
don't
read
it
--
this
court
that
way,
are
we
free
to
affirm
on
section
3
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
free
to
uphold
commission
on
section
3.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
324.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
the
plan
v
arrangement
involved
an
element
of
consent
by
the
railroad,
but
when
you
have
a
joint
arrangement
like
that,
and
i
understand
that
the
property
moves
under
a
bill
of
lading
issued
to
private
service
carrier
to
make
the
movement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
motor
carrier
undertakes
or
at
least
negotiates
with
the
shipper
to
get
it
from
a
to
b
and
he
really
is
issuing
a
bill
of
lading
which
involves
a
rail
shipment.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
if
they
say
it
makes
a
critical
difference
in
terms
of
the
issue
you're
talking
about
if
the
railroad
hasn't
consented?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
--
or
that
--
or
that
it
has
to
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
--
would
3
(1)
--
mr.
shea,
would
3
(1)
permit
a
railroad
to
charge
a
dollar
to
--
a
dollar
to
a
--
or
traffic
which
it
receives
from
its
wholly
owned
trucking
subsidiary
and
charge
$2
for
a
traffic
that
as
we
see
from
an
independent
trucking
establishment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
let's
not
talk
about
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
let's
just
talk
about
3
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
3
(1)
permits
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
violation
of
3
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
here
comes
the
--
at
one
truck
line
comes
up
with
the
--
with
the
--
with
some
--
with
some
trailers
full
of
new
cars
and
wants
them
hauled
to
san
francisco.
and
the
railroad
says,
“sure,
we
will.
we'll
charge
you
a
dollar”.
and
the
next
day,
another
truck
line
comes
up
with
the
same
trailer
and
same
cars
and
they
charged
them
$2
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
the
same
trip.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
say
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
all.
they
say,
“$2
we'll
take
it.
sure!
we'll
charge
you
$2”.
justice
byron
r.
white
3
(1)
is
not
but
something
else
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
section
2
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
isn't
it?
isn't
that
section
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
have
a
proviso,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
--
and
you
would
likewise
say
then
that
the
rail
--
railroad
could
accept
the
traffic
of
the
one
carrier
on
the
first
day,
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary
trucking
establishment
and
wholly
refuse
to
accept
the
traffic
from
an
independent
establishment
the
next
day
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
3
or
2
or
any
other
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
one
other
--
in
connection
with
this
--
in
accepting
the
traffic
from
its
own
wholly
owned
subsidiary
for
transportation
to
san
francisco,
could
it
--
would
it
have
to
do
it
via
the
through
route
or
joint
rate
or
whatever
you
would
call
it
or
would
it
--
or
--
or
could
that
--
or
--
or
--
could
that
truck
--
particular
truck
line
have
an
open
tariff
arrangement
and
make
the
sail
itself
originate
the
traffic
and
utilize
which
device,
is
it
v?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the
only
way
the
--
i
gather,
do
you
think
the
only
way
a
truck
line
can
actually
have
the
authority
to
undertake
the
--
or
to
furnish
part
of
its
service
that
it
undertakes
to
furnish
by
railroad,
the
only
way
it
can
do
that
is
to
have
a
voluntary
agreement
with
the
railroad.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
--
you
mean
a
railroad
if
it's
going
to
do
business,
would
accept
any
traffic
from
a
truck
line
--
from
any
truck
line
would
have
to
do
so
for
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
are
you
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
obligation
under
the
act
--
what
obligation
is
there
in
the
act
that
says
that
the
divisions
have
to
be
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
that
--
you
think
that
--
that
applies
between
--
between
two
different
divisions
between
the
--
between
carriers
--
two
different
sets
of
joint
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
was
just
within
one
joint
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
thomas,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
same
impact
result
to
your
group
of
people,
the
forwarders
if
the
railroads
just
as
a
general
matter
agreed
to
joint
rates
or
through
routes
with
motor
carriers?
i
mean,
wouldn't
--
wholly
aside
from
the
technical,
legal
difference
perhaps
between
as
joint
--
a
consensual
arrangement
like
that
and
a
compulsory
when
the
impact
on
you
would
be
precisely
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
that's
what
i
mean
if
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
do
provide
joint
through
routes,
they
--
to
the
extent
that
they
do,
this
has
a
serious
impact
on
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
agree
--
you
agree
that
regardless
of
the
impact
on
you
that
the
joint
--
the
joint
rate
arrangement,
the
consensual
arrangement
between
the
motor
carrier
and
the
railroad
is
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
but
it
still
has
quite
in
effect
on
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
object
to
the
--
i
would
think
you
would
also
have
some
fear
of
the
railroads,
making
their
own
arrangements
with
just
a
few
carriers
namely
the
ones
we
assume
that
have
some
corporate
connections
and
those
--
and
those
carriers
in
effect
acting
--
those
motor
carriers
in
effect
acting
as
freight
forwarders.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
just
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
impact
is
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
impact
on
you
is
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
economically
to
the
extent
that
they
enter
into
joint
through
rates
that
it
cuts
into
your
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginnane,
isn't
the
--
hasn't
--
isn't
the
commission
--
hasn't
it
changed
his
mind
considerably
about
the
acceptability
of
one
carrier
operating
service
by
another
mode?
hasn't
this
--it
has
indeed.
isn't
this
quite
a
change
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
court
ever
touched
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
--
just
like
they
can
do
with
the
railroads?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
suggestion
that
if
the
railroads
--
that
a
railroad
--
if
it
enters
into
a
joint
rate
with
--
or
through
route
with
one
motor
carrier,
it
must
do
so
with
another
on
the
same
term.
if
that
were
the
law,
there
wouldn't
be
much
problem
here,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
line
--
justice
byron
r.
white
between
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
in
the
example
i
gave,
do
you
think
that
the
act
would
permit
--
216
would
permit
a
--
the
railroads
entering
into
an
arrangement
with
one
carrier
at
--
at
motor
carrier
a
dollar
and
another
motor
carrier
at
$2?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
your
position
is
that
there
--
that
there's
another
section
that
prevents
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
though
that
if
the
railroads
have
an
open
tariff
arrangement
for
the
public
that
section
--
sections
2
and
3
require
that
to
be
available
to
the
truckers
as
well.
