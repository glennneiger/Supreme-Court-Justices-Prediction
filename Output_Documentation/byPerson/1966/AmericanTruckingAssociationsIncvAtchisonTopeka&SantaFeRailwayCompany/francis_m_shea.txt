mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
deal
briefly
with
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
that
seems
to
me
dispositive
of
the
case.
as
i
understand
mr.
ginnane,
he
seeks
to
derive
from
the
provisions
of
section
2
and
3
(1)
of
the
act,
a
principle
of
equality
as
he
puts
it.
i
should
note
and
i'll
have
more
to
say
this
later
that
the
commission
did
not
rely
on
3
(1),
a
good
reason
i
think.
but
in
any
event,
what
is
sought
to
be
derived
from
these
provisions
is
a
principle
of
equality
and
i
think
mr.
ginnane
states
it
in
these
terms
that
one
man
have
looked
to
the
ownership
of
the
goods,
one
man
have
looked
to
the
competitive
situation,
if
traffic
is
tendered
by
a
shipper
or
a
freight
forwarder
or
a
motor
carrier
to
a
railroad,
the
same
service
must
be
afforded
at
the
same
rates.
now,
if
any
such
principle
is
to
be
derived
from
the
provisions
of
section
2
and
3
of
the
act,
i
suggest
that
that
principle
condemns
rather
than
supports
the
rules
which
had
been
promulgated
by
the
commission.
be
sure,
under
these
rules,
the
motor
carrier
is
entitled
under
the
open
tariff
to
move
its
traffic
--
to
move
the
traffic
that
it's
moving
for
a
customer,
at
the
same
rate
as
the
shipper
or
the
forwarder.
but
it's
entitled
to
move
it
under
these
rules
at
a
preferred
rate,
at
a
better
rate.
it's
entitled
to
enter
into
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
to
work
out
divisions
pursuant
to
which
the
motor
carrier
will
move
the
traffic
of
its
customer
over
the
railroad
at
a
lesser
rate
than
the
rate
at
which
the
shipper
may
or
its
competitor,
the
freight
forwarder
man,
so
that
in
the
matter
of
--
under
this
principle
of
equality,
on
the
matter
of
rates,
it
is
clear
under
these
rules
that
the
motor
carrier
may
move
its
traffic
at
something
that
isn't
governed
by
a
principle
of
equality
under
divisions
and
through
routes
and
joint
rates
at
a
lesser
rate.
moreover,
turning
to
the
matter
of
service
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
higher
or
let's
just
say
a
different
rate.
that
is
the
principle
of
equality,
i
take
it,
is
violated
as
much
by
a
greater
as
a
lesser
rate.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that
is
true,
under
216
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
as
216
(c)
makes
it
voluntary,
i
take
it
that
it
is
clear
that
if
the
railroad
refuses
to
enter
into
it,
it
doesn't
have
to
enter
into
it.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
through
the
joint
route,
through
--
a
joint
rate
through
arrangement
which
is
provided
for
in
these
rules
by
a
separate
agreement
between
the
railroad
and
carrier,
what
would
certainly
be
a
rebate
if
arrived
at
by
special
agreement
to
secure
a
lesser
charge
for
the
movement.
these
rules
authorized
a
lesser
or
a
different
charge
at
least
to
be
secured
by
the
motor
carriers.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
2
provides
that
you
must
render
the
same
service.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
now
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
if
the
court
--
if
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
section
3
which
is
in
pari
materia,
section
2,
deals
specifically
with
it.
i
could
understand
the
language
of
section
2
being
stretched
if
it
were
the
only
language
of
discrimination.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
but
section
3
provides
expressly
and
there's
no
disagreement
that
i
take
it
between
us
that
you
can't
let
a
preference
in
service
but
there's
a
difficulty
with
section
3
which
the
chief
justice
noted
and
that
is
that
it
has
a
proviso.
and
that
proviso
says
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
discrimination,
prejudice
or
disadvantage
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier
of
whatever
description.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
language
is
clear
and
it
is
general.
section
3
doesn't
--
can't
be
construed
to
apply
to
any
discrimination
or
disadvantage
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier.
mr.
ginnane
would
have
you
read
it
as
saying
that
it
may
not
be
construed
as
applying
to
discrimination
or
disadvantage
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier
if
that
discrimination
or
disadvantage
is
accomplished
by
undercutting
the
rates
of
the
other
carrier
--
the
other
carrier.
well,
i
think
that
no
amount
of
legislative
history
would
permit
a
rewriting
of
that
proviso
to
that
extent
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
support
any
such
contention.
the
one
piece
of
legislative
history
which
is
referred
to
as
the
statement
of
senator
wheeler
in
introducing
this
proviso
into
216
(d)
in
part
ii
but
it
was
taken
over
from
there.
and
to
be
sure,
senator
wheeler
said,
the
occasion
for
putting
this
proviso
in
is
that
some
of
the
motor
carriers
fear
that
section
3
would
be
construed
to
extend
to
discrimination
or
disadvantage
resulting
from
undercutting
the
railroads
rates.
but
he
goes
on
to
say,
this
proviso
was
unnecessary,
section
3
(1)
from
which
216
is
derived,
has
always
been
construed
as
applying
only
to
preferences
or
discrimination
preference
or
prejudice,
the
language
of
3
(1)
between
patrons
or
to
the
traffic
of
patrons.
and
he
says
this,
reading
it
quite
clearly,
in
contrast
of
the
proviso
relating
to
discrimination
or
preferences
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier.
and
indeed,
the
cases
construing
3
(1)
before
the
proviso
had
held
that
it
was
not
applicable
to
discrimination
against
another
carrier
or
the
traffic
of
another
carrier
but
only
discrimination
relating
to
shippers.
and
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
language
of
this
proviso
clearly
indicates
that
3
(1)
is
not
applicable
as
a
basis
for
requiring
that
the
traffic
of
competitors
be
treated
the
same
as
the
traffic
of
shippers
or
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
now,
we
get
into
the
--
if
through
routes
and
joint
rates
have
finally
established
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
it
seems
that
--
you're
not
getting
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
you're
not
getting
into
an
issue
divisions.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
say
that
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
they
can
--
the
railroad
can
say
“we
won't
take
it
at
all”
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
but
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
as
far
as
3
(1)
is
concerned,
3
(1)
is
not
applicable.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
something
else
is
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
that
through
route
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no,
i
think
section
2
is
not
applicable
because
i
think
section
2
likewise
is
not
applicable
to
the
traffic
of
competing
carriers.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no,
it
doesn't
have
a
proviso.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
but
now,
i
don't
mean
that
the
congress
has
ignored
altogether
this
problem.
it
hasn't.
so
far
as
relations
between
railroads
are
concerned
or
the
railroads
and
water
carriers
are
concerned,
they've
dealt
specifically
with
the
problem
and
they
dealt
specifically
with
the
kind
of
a
problem
which
the
government
seeks
to
reach
by
pressing
into
service,
i
think,
provisions
which
were
not
intended
to
reach
this
problem.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
and
they've
done
that
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
five
or
one
--
well,
under
--
under
plan
i,
--
they
could
originate
the
traffic
and
fix
the
rate.
now,
there's
--
some
of
my
colleagues
consider
that
a
through
route
and
the
commission
considered
it
the
through
route.
under
v,
they
could
establish
a
through
route-joint
rate
quite
clearly.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
now,
this
isn't
true
of
course
as
between
railroads.
this
isn't
true
as
between
railroad
and
water
carriers.
there,
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
force
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
it
has
the
authority
to
see
that
the
railroad
provides
adequate
facility
to
carry
it
on
and
it
has
the
authority
under
3
(4)
to
see
that
it
doesn't
discriminate
between
others
and
eastman
wanted
this
in
part
ii
and
couldn't
get
any
support
for
it.
and
subsequently
on
several
occasions,
the
commission
is
trying
to
get
this
authority.
now,
these
are
the
appropriate
provisions
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
problem.
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
wise
that
there
shouldn't
be
provisions
that
permits
the
commission
to
require
proper
coordination
of
service
between
the
motor
carriers
and
the
rails,
i'm
saying
that
it
is
clear
that
they
haven't
got
it.
it
is
clear
that
this
has
been
left
to
voluntary
arrangements
and
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
comment
if
i
may
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
mr.
ginnane
will
know,
can
the
railroads
also
hand
this
over
to
the
truckers?
can
they
use
their
open
tariffs?
mr.
ginnane
said,
“yes,”
and
i
suppose
there's
any
principle
of
equality
a
railroad
can
also
hand
over
the
traffic
it
doesn't
want
to
another
railroad
or
to
another
carrier
--
motor
carrier
when
it
gets
it
from
a
motor
carrier,
hand
it
on
to
another
railroad
or
another
motor
carrier.
the
dissenting
commissioner
must
have
a
way
of
thought
this
introduced
an
incredible
confusion
and
we
didn't
know
where
we're
getting.
i
don't
know
where
it
leads.
but
certainly,
the
commission
doesn't
know
where
it
leads.
it's
made
no
record
on
this
and
it
hasn't
addressed
itself
to
it
and
it
certainly
hasn't
shown
the
discriminating
awareness
or
the
consequences
of
its
acts
which
appears
to
be
the
standard
of
burlington
and
this
court.
i
think
that
there
is
enormous
confusion
and
some
of
the
questions
indicate
the
problems
of
confusion,
in
this
situation
and
the
reason
there
is,
is
that
the
commission
has
not
stated
clearly
what
its
position
is,
what
support
there
is
for
that
position
and
where
it
leads.
and
a
minimum
seems
to
me
that
should
be
returned
to
tell
us
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
needs
to
be
returned
to
them.
just
let
me
make
this
final
point,
mr.
ginnane,
i
gather,
says
that
this
is
an
interpretive
rule
and
i
take
it
what
it
means
by
that
is
that
the
commission's
opinion
is
nothing
but
stating
what
it
understands,
section
2
could
mean
in
this
context
and
if
it's
wrong,
i
suppose,
the
answer
of
this
court
would
be
that
you're
wrong
and
then
it's
up
to
them
to
proceed
under
some
other
section
if
they
choose
to
do
it.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
my
time
be
saved
unless
there
are
further
question.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no.
i
think
it
can
only
do
so
where
the
issue
is
--
where
this
provision
is
sought
to
be
applied,
construed
to
apply
to
a
situation
where
it
is
assertive
that
a
discrimination
against
the
service
of
the
traffic
of
the
--
of
another
carrier
is
the
violation
that
is
asserted.
now,
that
may
cut
deep
but
to
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
except
that
cuts
deep.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
have
--
well,
maybe,
perhaps
this
distinction
is
not
important,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
not
saying
any
discrimination
goes.
i'm
saying
that
section
3
does
not
prohibit
the
discrimination.
now,
other
sections
of
the
act
prohibit
discrimination
as
between
railroads
or
railroads
and
water
carriers
in
refusing
to
coordinate
their
activities
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
but
this
doesn't.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
first,
may
i
note
that
the
record
doesn't
establish
any
general
refusal.
this
is
an
assertion
that's
made
in
the
government's
brief
but
mr.
ginnane
didn't
pursue
that
but
what
i
would
say
is,
yes,
the
proviso
excludes
it.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i'm
saying
that
a
motor
carrier
can't
demand
that
--
that
--
acting
as
a
motor
carrier
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
but
acting
as
a
motor
carrier,
there
is
a
line
of
cases
of
course
which
says
that
where
he's
tendering
his
own
goods
where
the
motor
carrier
is
tending
his
own
goods
or
railroad
is
tending
its
own
goods.
it's
tendering
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
as
a
carry?
mr.
francis
m.
shea
so
far
as
the
motor
carriers
are
concerned,
it's
voluntary
so
far
as
between
railroads
and
railroads
and
water
carriers,
it
is
not
voluntary.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
deal
briefly
with
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
that
seems
to
me
dispositive
of
the
case.
as
i
understand
mr.
ginnane,
he
seeks
to
derive
from
the
provisions
of
section
2
and
3
(1)
of
the
act,
a
principle
of
equality
as
he
puts
it.
i
should
note
and
i'll
have
more
to
say
this
later
that
the
commission
did
not
rely
on
3
(1),
a
good
reason
i
think.
but
in
any
event,
what
is
sought
to
be
derived
from
these
provisions
is
a
principle
of
equality
and
i
think
mr.
ginnane
states
it
in
these
terms
that
one
man
have
looked
to
the
ownership
of
the
goods,
one
man
have
looked
to
the
competitive
situation,
if
traffic
is
tendered
by
a
shipper
or
a
freight
forwarder
or
a
motor
carrier
to
a
railroad,
the
same
service
must
be
afforded
at
the
same
rates.
now,
if
any
such
principle
is
to
be
derived
from
the
provisions
of
section
2
and
3
of
the
act,
i
suggest
that
that
principle
condemns
rather
than
supports
the
rules
which
had
been
promulgated
by
the
commission.
be
sure,
under
these
rules,
the
motor
carrier
is
entitled
under
the
open
tariff
to
move
its
traffic
--
to
move
the
traffic
that
it's
moving
for
a
customer,
at
the
same
rate
as
the
shipper
or
the
forwarder.
but
it's
entitled
to
move
it
under
these
rules
at
a
preferred
rate,
at
a
better
rate.
it's
entitled
to
enter
into
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
to
work
out
divisions
pursuant
to
which
the
motor
carrier
will
move
the
traffic
of
its
customer
over
the
railroad
at
a
lesser
rate
than
the
rate
at
which
the
shipper
may
or
its
competitor,
the
freight
forwarder
man,
so
that
in
the
matter
of
--
under
this
principle
of
equality,
on
the
matter
of
rates,
it
is
clear
under
these
rules
that
the
motor
carrier
may
move
its
traffic
at
something
that
isn't
governed
by
a
principle
of
equality
under
divisions
and
through
routes
and
joint
rates
at
a
lesser
rate.
moreover,
turning
to
the
matter
of
service
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
higher
or
let's
just
say
a
different
rate.
that
is
the
principle
of
equality,
i
take
it,
is
violated
as
much
by
a
greater
as
a
lesser
rate.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that
is
true,
under
216
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
as
216
(c)
makes
it
voluntary,
i
take
it
that
it
is
clear
that
if
the
railroad
refuses
to
enter
into
it,
it
doesn't
have
to
enter
into
it.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
through
the
joint
route,
through
--
a
joint
rate
through
arrangement
which
is
provided
for
in
these
rules
by
a
separate
agreement
between
the
railroad
and
carrier,
what
would
certainly
be
a
rebate
if
arrived
at
by
special
agreement
to
secure
a
lesser
charge
for
the
movement.
these
rules
authorized
a
lesser
or
a
different
charge
at
least
to
be
secured
by
the
motor
carriers.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
2
provides
that
you
must
render
the
same
service.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
now
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
if
the
court
--
if
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
section
3
which
is
in
pari
materia,
section
2,
deals
specifically
with
it.
i
could
understand
the
language
of
section
2
being
stretched
if
it
were
the
only
language
of
discrimination.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
but
section
3
provides
expressly
and
there's
no
disagreement
that
i
take
it
between
us
that
you
can't
let
a
preference
in
service
but
there's
a
difficulty
with
section
3
which
the
chief
justice
noted
and
that
is
that
it
has
a
proviso.
and
that
proviso
says
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
discrimination,
prejudice
or
disadvantage
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier
of
whatever
description.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
language
is
clear
and
it
is
general.
section
3
doesn't
--
can't
be
construed
to
apply
to
any
discrimination
or
disadvantage
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier.
mr.
ginnane
would
have
you
read
it
as
saying
that
it
may
not
be
construed
as
applying
to
discrimination
or
disadvantage
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier
if
that
discrimination
or
disadvantage
is
accomplished
by
undercutting
the
rates
of
the
other
carrier
--
the
other
carrier.
well,
i
think
that
no
amount
of
legislative
history
would
permit
a
rewriting
of
that
proviso
to
that
extent
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
support
any
such
contention.
the
one
piece
of
legislative
history
which
is
referred
to
as
the
statement
of
senator
wheeler
in
introducing
this
proviso
into
216
(d)
in
part
ii
but
it
was
taken
over
from
there.
and
to
be
sure,
senator
wheeler
said,
the
occasion
for
putting
this
proviso
in
is
that
some
of
the
motor
carriers
fear
that
section
3
would
be
construed
to
extend
to
discrimination
or
disadvantage
resulting
from
undercutting
the
railroads
rates.
but
he
goes
on
to
say,
this
proviso
was
unnecessary,
section
3
(1)
from
which
216
is
derived,
has
always
been
construed
as
applying
only
to
preferences
or
discrimination
preference
or
prejudice,
the
language
of
3
(1)
between
patrons
or
to
the
traffic
of
patrons.
and
he
says
this,
reading
it
quite
clearly,
in
contrast
of
the
proviso
relating
to
discrimination
or
preferences
to
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier.
and
indeed,
the
cases
construing
3
(1)
before
the
proviso
had
held
that
it
was
not
applicable
to
discrimination
against
another
carrier
or
the
traffic
of
another
carrier
but
only
discrimination
relating
to
shippers.
and
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
language
of
this
proviso
clearly
indicates
that
3
(1)
is
not
applicable
as
a
basis
for
requiring
that
the
traffic
of
competitors
be
treated
the
same
as
the
traffic
of
shippers
or
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
now,
we
get
into
the
--
if
through
routes
and
joint
rates
have
finally
established
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
it
seems
that
--
you're
not
getting
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
you're
not
getting
into
an
issue
divisions.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
say
that
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
they
can
--
the
railroad
can
say
“we
won't
take
it
at
all”
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
but
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
as
far
as
3
(1)
is
concerned,
3
(1)
is
not
applicable.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
something
else
is
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
that
through
route
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no,
i
think
section
2
is
not
applicable
because
i
think
section
2
likewise
is
not
applicable
to
the
traffic
of
competing
carriers.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no,
it
doesn't
have
a
proviso.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
but
now,
i
don't
mean
that
the
congress
has
ignored
altogether
this
problem.
it
hasn't.
so
far
as
relations
between
railroads
are
concerned
or
the
railroads
and
water
carriers
are
concerned,
they've
dealt
specifically
with
the
problem
and
they
dealt
specifically
with
the
kind
of
a
problem
which
the
government
seeks
to
reach
by
pressing
into
service,
i
think,
provisions
which
were
not
intended
to
reach
this
problem.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
and
they've
done
that
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
five
or
one
--
well,
under
--
under
plan
i,
--
they
could
originate
the
traffic
and
fix
the
rate.
now,
there's
--
some
of
my
colleagues
consider
that
a
through
route
and
the
commission
considered
it
the
through
route.
under
v,
they
could
establish
a
through
route-joint
rate
quite
clearly.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
now,
this
isn't
true
of
course
as
between
railroads.
this
isn't
true
as
between
railroad
and
water
carriers.
there,
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
force
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
it
has
the
authority
to
see
that
the
railroad
provides
adequate
facility
to
carry
it
on
and
it
has
the
authority
under
3
(4)
to
see
that
it
doesn't
discriminate
between
others
and
eastman
wanted
this
in
part
ii
and
couldn't
get
any
support
for
it.
and
subsequently
on
several
occasions,
the
commission
is
trying
to
get
this
authority.
now,
these
are
the
appropriate
provisions
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
problem.
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
wise
that
there
shouldn't
be
provisions
that
permits
the
commission
to
require
proper
coordination
of
service
between
the
motor
carriers
and
the
rails,
i'm
saying
that
it
is
clear
that
they
haven't
got
it.
it
is
clear
that
this
has
been
left
to
voluntary
arrangements
and
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
comment
if
i
may
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
mr.
ginnane
will
know,
can
the
railroads
also
hand
this
over
to
the
truckers?
can
they
use
their
open
tariffs?
mr.
ginnane
said,
“yes,”
and
i
suppose
there's
any
principle
of
equality
a
railroad
can
also
hand
over
the
traffic
it
doesn't
want
to
another
railroad
or
to
another
carrier
--
motor
carrier
when
it
gets
it
from
a
motor
carrier,
hand
it
on
to
another
railroad
or
another
motor
carrier.
the
dissenting
commissioner
must
have
a
way
of
thought
this
introduced
an
incredible
confusion
and
we
didn't
know
where
we're
getting.
i
don't
know
where
it
leads.
but
certainly,
the
commission
doesn't
know
where
it
leads.
it's
made
no
record
on
this
and
it
hasn't
addressed
itself
to
it
and
it
certainly
hasn't
shown
the
discriminating
awareness
or
the
consequences
of
its
acts
which
appears
to
be
the
standard
of
burlington
and
this
court.
i
think
that
there
is
enormous
confusion
and
some
of
the
questions
indicate
the
problems
of
confusion,
in
this
situation
and
the
reason
there
is,
is
that
the
commission
has
not
stated
clearly
what
its
position
is,
what
support
there
is
for
that
position
and
where
it
leads.
and
a
minimum
seems
to
me
that
should
be
returned
to
tell
us
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
needs
to
be
returned
to
them.
just
let
me
make
this
final
point,
mr.
ginnane,
i
gather,
says
that
this
is
an
interpretive
rule
and
i
take
it
what
it
means
by
that
is
that
the
commission's
opinion
is
nothing
but
stating
what
it
understands,
section
2
could
mean
in
this
context
and
if
it's
wrong,
i
suppose,
the
answer
of
this
court
would
be
that
you're
wrong
and
then
it's
up
to
them
to
proceed
under
some
other
section
if
they
choose
to
do
it.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
my
time
be
saved
unless
there
are
further
question.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no.
i
think
it
can
only
do
so
where
the
issue
is
--
where
this
provision
is
sought
to
be
applied,
construed
to
apply
to
a
situation
where
it
is
assertive
that
a
discrimination
against
the
service
of
the
traffic
of
the
--
of
another
carrier
is
the
violation
that
is
asserted.
now,
that
may
cut
deep
but
to
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
except
that
cuts
deep.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
have
--
well,
maybe,
perhaps
this
distinction
is
not
important,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
not
saying
any
discrimination
goes.
i'm
saying
that
section
3
does
not
prohibit
the
discrimination.
now,
other
sections
of
the
act
prohibit
discrimination
as
between
railroads
or
railroads
and
water
carriers
in
refusing
to
coordinate
their
activities
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
but
this
doesn't.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well
first,
may
i
note
that
the
record
doesn't
establish
any
general
refusal.
this
is
an
assertion
that's
made
in
the
government's
brief
but
mr.
ginnane
didn't
pursue
that
but
what
i
would
say
is,
yes,
the
proviso
excludes
it.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i'm
saying
that
a
motor
carrier
can't
demand
that
--
that
--
acting
as
a
motor
carrier
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
but
acting
as
a
motor
carrier,
there
is
a
line
of
cases
of
course
which
says
that
where
he's
tendering
his
own
goods
where
the
motor
carrier
is
tending
his
own
goods
or
railroad
is
tending
its
own
goods.
it's
tendering
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
as
a
carry?
mr.
francis
m.
shea
so
far
as
the
motor
carriers
are
concerned,
it's
voluntary
so
far
as
between
railroads
and
railroads
and
water
carriers,
it
is
not
voluntary.
