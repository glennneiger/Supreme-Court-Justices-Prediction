mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
mr.
ginnane
indicated
for
the
motor
carrier
appellants
in
both
numbers
57
and
59.
mr.
ginnane
has
discussed
the
lawfulness
of
the
open-tariff
piggyback
rules
under
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act.
the
district
court
also
concluded
that
the
rules,
the
two
open-tariff
rules
must
fall
because
they
come
into
direct
conflict
with
the
provisions
of
section
216
(c)
of
part
ii
which
relates
to
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
motor
carriers
and
between
motor
carriers
and
rail
and
water
carriers,
and
also
because
of
a
conflict
with
the
provisions
of
part
iv
of
the
act
regulating
freight
forwarders.
the
district
court
and
the
commission
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
red
one.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
district
court
and
the
commission
take
a
basically
different
view
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
and
this
difference
of
view
leads
to
enlarged
measure.
i
think
there
are
different
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
open-tariff
rules.
the
district
court
looked
at
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
a
rigid
division
of
service
transportation
in
the
four
modes
as
they
are
regulated
by
the
four
roman
numeral
parts
of
the
act
and
it
spoke
of
each
mode
being
confined
to
transportation
by
that
mode
in
terms
of
both
the
--
the
actual
separation
into
four
parts
and
in
terms
of
the
internal
logic
of
the
act,
therefore,
it
concluded
that
a
motor
carrier
is
confined
to
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
unless
there
are
some
special
exception.
the
commission,
however,
as
mr.
ginnane
has
noted
after
reviewing
the
history
of
the
development
of
piggyback
or
trailer-on-flatcar
transportation,
concluded
that
it
is
a
bimodal
service,
it
combines
elements
of
both
rail
and
motor
transportation
as
the
more
formal
name
trailer-on-flatcar
service
that
suggest
two
necessary
elements,
a
trailer
and
a
flatcar
and
the
trailer
is
just
as
essential
to
the
successful
operation
of
the
service
as
the
flatcar.
but
a
bimodal
service
won't
fit
into
the
rigid
modal
pattern
that
the
district
court
suggests
for
the
act.
the
district
court
accepted
the
argument
of
the
appellees
that
trailer-on-flatcar
service
is
a
rail
service.
it
did
not
discuss
and
didn't
specifically
overturn
the
commission's
conclusion
that
it
is
a
bimodal
service.
the
appellees
of
course
do
dispute
it
and
in
their
briefs
they,
they
based
their
arguments
on
the
violations
with
respect
to
section
216
and
part
iv
on
the
theory
that
this
is
a
rail
service
that
we
are
dealing
with.
the
commission
was
in
this
case
dealing
with
a
new
transportation
development
which
combines
elements
of
the
old.
it
combines
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
cannot
be
separated.
if
a
highway
trailer
is
not
used,
trailer-on-flatcar
transportation
simply
will
not
be
successful.
the
whole
theory
of
developing
it
and
its
whole
success
in
this
rapid
growth
that
mr.
ginnane
referred
to
has
been
the
ability
to
transport
a
loader
freight
from
shipper's
door
to
consignee
door
in
the
same
highway
vehicle
without
a
transfer
of
lading
in
route.
the
district
court,
however,
viewing
the
act
as
confining
each
carrier
to
transportation
by
its
separate
mode
absent
some
exception
looked
to
section
216
(c)
covering
the
through
routes
and
joint
rate
arrangements
for
motor
carriers,
as
the
only
possible
exception
to
this
rigid
modal
pattern
which
modal
pattern
would
confine
the
motor
carriers
to
operations
strictly
by
motor
vehicle.
the
district
court
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
no,
the
red
one
sir.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i'm
sorry.
the
district
court
said
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did
not
dispute
the
premise
of
the
appellees'
arguments
below
that
a
de
facto
through
routes
is
created
when
a
motor
carrier
utilizes
a
rail
movement
under
an
open
rail
tariff.
actually,
an
answer
to
that
argument
as
it
was
made
to
the
commission,
it
said
that
what
is
a
through
route
is
a
matter
of
fact
and
it's
cited
among
other
cases
thompson
versus
u.s.,
343
u.s.
being
a
question
of
fact
what
is
a
through
a
route
is
not
subject
to
any
general
rule
but
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances.
in
thompson,
this
court
said
that
the
test
of
a
through
route
is
whether
the
participating
carriers
hold
themselves
out
as
offering
a
through
transportation
service.
the
district
court
compared
the,
what
it
called,
the
operative
features
of
the
plan
i
which
everybody
with
one
possible
exception
on
the
side,
the
appellees
concedes
is
a
valid
through
route-joint
rate
arrangements
between
a
railroad
and
a
motor
carrier.
and
the
motor
carrier
participation
in
trailer-on-flatcar
service
under
the
commission's
proposed
open-tariff
rules.
it
concluded
--
the
only
difference
is
the
consent
of
the
railroads.
and
if
the
consent
is
lacking,
i
think
all
parties
agree
the
216
(c)
would
preclude
the
through
route
arrangement.
but
the
test
of
a
through
route
as
the
court
said
in
thompson
is
whether
the
carriers
hold
themselves
out
to
perform
a
through
service.
when
a
motor
carrier
under
its
own
billing
secures
a
trailer
load
of
freight
takes
it
to
a
railroad
raft
and
under
a
railroad
tariff
holding
out
a
ramp-to-ramp
plan
iii
service
offers
that
trailer
to
the
railroad,
picks
it
up
at
the
terminal
ramp
of
the
rail
run,
carries
it
onto
the
ultimate
customer
and
delivers
it,
the
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
are
not
holding
out
a
through
service.
the
railroad
tariff
covers
only
the
rail
movement
between
the
ramps.
the
rail
bill
of
lading
is
with
the
motor
carrier.
the
rail
has
no
contract
with
the
shipper.
the
railroad
rate
for
this
rail
portion
of
the
service
is
determined
by
itself,
the
rules
and
regulations
which
cover
the
applicability
of
the
service
are
set
by
the
railroad
in
a
--
through
route
arrangement
under
a
plan
i
operation
or
a
conventional
plan
v
operation.
the
participating
carriers
joining
together
and
holding
out
the
through
route
joined
together
and
determine
the
rate
that
is
to
be
applied
on
the
through
transportation.
the
bill
of
lading
which
the
shipper
covers
the
entire
shipment
and
both
the
rail
and
the
motor
carrier
are
obligated
to
the
shipper
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
entire
transportation
service.
the
differences
in
the
obligations
and
liabilities
are
set
at
in
our
brief,
the
--
essentially
the
--
under
a
through
route
arrangement,
be
the
railroad
or
motor
carrier
is
liable
to
the
shipper
for
the
proper
completion
of
the
trip
and
for
any
loss
or
damage
that
may
occur.
now,
the
motor
carrier
is
the
only
one
who
contracts
with
the
shipper.
the
railroad's
contract
is
exclusively
with
motor
carrier
and
only
for
the
rail
portion
of
the
trailer.
the
railroad
is
not
liable
to
the
shipper
for
this
removal.
the
district
court
assumed
that
there
is
a
de
facto
through
route
created
and
dealt
with
the
question
of
compulsion
and
as
i
said,
if
there
is
a
through
route
created,
then
it
cannot
be
compelled
under
section
216
(c)
because
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
motor
carrier
of
property
or
between
motor
carriers
of
property
and
railroads
are
permissive
under
216
(c),
but
when
there
is
no
through
route
involved,
there
is
no
compulsion
on
the
railroad
entering
a
through
route.
the
only
compulsion
that
there
is
and
this
is
the
compulsion
mentioned
in
the
commission's
report
is
to
hold
out
its
service.
the
commission
said
there's
no
compulsion
on
the
railroad
either
to
provide
this
trailer-on-flatcar
service
or
on
the
motor
carrier
to
make
use
of.
the
only
compulsion
there
is
on
the
railroad
where
it
holds
out
its
service
to
the
public
in
an
open-tariff
to
serve
the
public
without
discrimination,
without
attempting
to
select
among
the
shippers
that
it
will
serve.
the
other
aspect
of
the
district
court
case
which
deals
with
a
direct
conflict
between
the
open-tariff
rules
and
provisions
of
the
act
are
those
really
in
part
iv
of
the
act
relating
to
the
regulation
of
freight
forwarders.
now,
the
district
court
in
its
decision
only
considered
the
extreme
case,
it
spoke
of
a
carrier
who
performed
only
an
assembly
in
distribution
service
and
use
another
carrier
to
perform
the
entire
transportation
service.
it
spoke
of
a
carrier
who's
--
who's
only
tied
with
the
motor
carrier
operation
with
an
unexercised
certificate.
but
the
commission
specifically
said
that
where
a
motor
carrier
holds
out
to
perform
only
this,
an
assembly
in
distribution
service
and
uses
an
underlying
transportation
company
between
points
that
it
itself
cannot
serve
in
a
practicable
manner,
then
no
doubt
in
the
commission's
own
line,
it
would
be
acting
a
forwarder
and
not
as
a
carrier
itself.
there
is
a
specific
section
of
the
commission's
report
which
was
not
discussed
in
the
district
court
opinion
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
the
abandonment
of
service
by
motor
carriers
at
authorized
points
through
the
use
of
trailer-on-flatcar
transportation.
a
rule
had
been
suggested
which
would
have
set
requirements
for
actual
operations
over
the
highway.
the
commission
considered
the
rule.
it
noted
its
power
under
section
204
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
to
regulate
motor
carriers
and
to
that
end
to
establish
reasonable
requirements
with
respect
to
continuous
and
adequate
service.
it
noted
in
fact
that
every
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
to
a
motor
carrier
by
it
carries
forward
this
requirement
as
to
the
performance
of
a
reasonably
continuous
and
adequate
service.
based
on
it's
consideration
of
it's
power
under
the
act
and
under
the
condition
that
they
have
put
in
the
certificate,
the
commission
found
it
unnecessary
to
prescribe
an
additional
rule
relating
to
the
motor
carrier
performance
of
an
adequate
service
over
the
highway
where
it
were
--
was
also
using
the
trailer-on-flatcar
service
between
the
points.
it
clearly,
in
that
discussion
showed
that
it
would
not
permit
a
motor
carrier
to
operate
as
the
--
in
the
court's
example
and
the
only
example
the
court
used
that
is
to
pre
--
stop
carrying
itself
on
the
highway
and
only
perform
an
assembly
in
distribution
service.
under
sections
402
(a)
(5)
of
the
act,
a
freight
forwarder
is
defined
as
a
person
who
otherwise
and
as
a
carrier
subject
to
part
i,
part
ii
or
part
iii
holds
out
to
transport
or
to
provide
transportation
in
a
certain
manner.
part
i,
part
ii,
and
part
iii
of
course
are
the
three
parts
that
covered
the
--
the
physical
modes
of
carriage,
railroads,
motor
carriers
and
water
carriers.
that
language
had
parenthetical
exclusory
language
otherwise
than
as
a
carrier
subject
to
part
i,
ii
or
iii,
is
recognition
by
congress
that
there
are
operational
similarities
between
what
freight
forwarders
do
and
--
in
our
example
that
we
are
using,
what
motor
carriers
do.
and
it
is
a
recognition
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
carve
out
a
--
an
exclusive
area
of
operation
for
the
freight
forwarder.
these
operational
similarities,
motor
carriers
for
years
have
assembled
small
shipments
into
volume
shipments
or
trailer
load
shipments
for
movement
and
perform
distribution
service.
as
long
as
a
motor
carrier
is
acting
as
a
motor
carrier
and
holds
out
the
motor
carrier
service
over
the
highway,
we
submit
that
the
definition
of
the
freight
forwarder
and
particularly
noting
the
exclusory
language
does
not
say
that
a
motor
carrier
becomes
a
forwarder
simply
because
it
may
use
trailer-on-flatcar
service
in
the
performance
of
some
of
its
authorized
service.
i
must
again
mention
some
of
the
horrible
examples
of
what
might
happen
where
these
rules
adopted
that
the
appellees
have
included
in
their
brief.
most
of
these
examples
have
been
referred
to
and
--
and
primarily
they
are
directed
to
either
the
question
of
aggravating
an
imbalance
of
operation
for
the
railroad
or
pushing
off
on
to
the
railroad
undesirable
or
traffic
--
or
traffic
which
is
difficult
to
handle.
the
thing
is
that
this
happens
right
today.
this
is
one
of
the
--
the
necessary
incidence
of
performing
a
transportation
service
that
all
transportation
agencies
deal
with.
we
all
have
imbalances
of
operations.
we
all
have
the
balloon
freight
or
the
--
the
oversized
freight
that
we
have
to
handle.
as
to
the
railroad's
open-tariff,
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
today
a
private
carrier,
a
shipper
as
mr.
ginnane
explain
who
uses
his
own
motor
vehicle
to
transport
his
freight,
he
can
decide
that
he
does
not
want
to
send
his
drivers
out
on
the
weekend
and
he
would
rather
take
a
group
of
his
trailers
which
normally
he
would
send
over
the
highway
with
his
own
equipment
taking
down
to
the
railroad
station
and
put
them
on
the
railroad
and
let
the
railroad
carry
it.
obviously,
all
private
carriers
are
--
are
reasonable
and
intelligent
businessmen,
the
difficult
to
handle
freights,
the
freight
which
is
more
expensive
to
carry,
they
will
if
possible
shipped
by
a
for
hire
carrier
and
they
will
tend
to
utilize
themselves,
their
own
equipment
in
as
much
as
possible
a
balanced
economical
operation.
and
of
course
freight
forwarders
and
shippers
associations,
shippers
associations
operating
in
much
the
same
manner
as
freight
forwarders
but
under
partial
exemptions
from
economic
regulations,
they
have
a
choice
of
the
carriers
they
may
use.
they
may
decide
because
of
weather
conditions,
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
examples
suggested
that
they
will
take
a
majority
of
their
trailers
that
are
ready
to
move
to
the
railroad
instead
of
shipping
them
by
some
other
means.
all
of
these
happens
today
and
of
course,
as
mr.
ginnane
said
we
view
the
problems
whether
they
are
caused
by
motor
carriers
making
use
of
the
trailer-on-flatcar
service
or
as
they
exist
already
in
the
railroad
operations,
with
a
consideration
of
reasonableness,
no
favored
shipper
of
a
railroad
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
down
friday
afternoon
with
an
additional
hundred
trailers
and
get
them
moved
out.
if
the
carrier
does
not
have
the
facilities
available,
it
calls
for
planning,
it
calls
for
cooperation,
it
calls
for
advance
notice.
mr.
ginnane
mentioned
the
compensatory
rates.
the
commission
in
its
report
at
page
329
points
out
that
a
number
of
the
people
who
had
supported
the
open-tariff
trailer-on-flatcar
rules
had
asked
why
should
a
railroad
object
to
receiving
additional
business,
that
question
still
hasn't
been
answered.
and
assuming
that
the
railroad
rates
for
this
service
are
compensatory
and
this
is
a
minimum
requirement
for
lawfulness
of
rate
is
that
it
be
compensatory,
additional
business
should
mean
additional
profit.
if
the
rates
are
too
low,
they
attract
this
traffic
now.
no
shipper
is
going
to
remain
loyal
indefinitely
to
a
motor
transportation
if
it
can
secure
a
comparable
service
at
a
lower
cost
from
another
mode
and
we
are
dealing
here
with
comparable
services.

a

well,
let
me
say
that

under
216
(c),
a

a
--
a

arrangement
and
end-to-end
arrangement
where

the

a

of

have
been

have
to
be
certificates
in
the
example
that
you're
talking
about,
as
common
carriers
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i
don't
know
whether
other
than
with
their
own
affiliate
motor
carriers,
railroads
are
securing
such
a
service.
i
think
that
the
reasoning
that
mr.
ginnane
used
so
far
as
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act
are
eminently
correct,
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
i
do
not
believe
a
motor
carrier
could
decide
to
accept
a
shipment
or
not
depending
on
who
the
shipper
was.
if
the
shipper
meets
the
tariff
requirements
for
the
shipment
then
the
motor
carrier
just
as
the
railroads
should
have
no
concern
about
whether
it
is
a
railroad
who
is
shipping.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes
sir.
the
--
any
discrimination
provisions
are
comparable
in
the
two
parts
of
the
act
and
they
apply
with
the
equal
force.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
here
was
carrying
out
its
duty
to
administer
and
enforce
the
act
in
the
light
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
particularly
the
--
the
end
objective
of
that
policy
is
to
develop,
coordinate,
and
preserve
the
national
transportation
system.
here
the
commission
was
dealing
with
a
new
and
explosive
development
in
transportation,
new
and
combining
two
elements
of
the
old
by
creating
something
apart
from
the
modal
divisions
that
have
been
known
before.
and
this
new
development
has
caused
a
substantial
alteration
in
our
transportation
system.
now,
the
motor
carrier
who
historically
was
the
carrier
who
had
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
flexibility
of
providing
a
door-to-door
service
is
meant
with
competition
in
the
provision
of
a
substantially
similar
service
by
railroads
and
by
freight
forwarders.
what
this
meant
was
more
than
this
because
while
the
railroads
and
the
freight
forwarders
can
utilize
this
new
bimodal
transportation
service,
the
motor
carrier
may
make
use
of
it
because
of
past
commission
decisions
only
at
the
sufferance
of
the
railroads,
only
under
the
permissive
through
route
and
through
rate
arrangements
of
section
216
(c)
where
he
has
to
get
the
railroad's
consent.
the
commission
here
recognized
the
bimodality
of
the
service.
it
recognized
that
all
carriers
should
be
equally
allowed
to
participate
in
it
without
restriction.
if
the
district
court
position
on
the
--
the
sharp
modal
separation
in
the
act
is
actually
followed
through
and
the
rules
as
it
said
must
stand
or
fall
despite
of
altered
circumstances
in
the
transportation
industry
that
the
logic
of
that
modal
division
should
preclude
railroads
from
making
use
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service
because
if
the
motor
carrier
is
not
providing
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
when
it
participates
in
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
the
railroad
is
not
providing
transportation
by
train
when
it
makes
use
of
a
service,
the
key
element
of
which
is
a
highway
vehicle
which
it
moves
over
the
highway
and
is
utilized
to
provide
a
door
to
door
movement
without
transfer
of
lading.
unfortunately,
from
the
motor
carrier
point
of
view,
in
1954
in
the
trailer,
then
what
is
called
the
new
haven
case
in
293
icc,
the
commission
considered
the
question
of
--
a
number
of
questions
relating
to
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
it
did
not
have
a
record,
it
made
its
decision
on
a
basis
of
questions
that
were
presented,
in
briefs,
and
in
oral
argument.
without
a
record
before,
the
commission
held
that
a
railroad
may
utilize
trailer-on-flatcar
service.
and
the
railroads
have
exploited
that
use
of
that
--
this
bimodal
transportation
service
to
divert
a
substantial
quantity
of
rate
for
the
motor
carriers
as
the
commission's
report
shows.
what
the
commission
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
case
ultimately
comes
down
to
restoring
the
competitive
balance.
the
railroads
have
had
an
opportunity
to
make
use
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
motor
carrier
for
years
to
divert
traffic
from
it.
the
railroads
have
been
able
to
limit
or
actually
preclude
motor
carrier
use
of
this
bimodal
service.
the
commission
here
simply
seeks
to
permit
the
motor
carriers
to
share
in
the
use
of
this
bimodal
service.
with
the
court's
permission,
we
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
exemption
in
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
section
3,
the
proviso
relating
to
the
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
--
the
traffic.
we
referred
to
the
remarks
of
senator
wheeler
when
a
comparable
proviso
was
being
put
into
the
--
the
provision
in
the
motor
carrier
part
of
the
act.
and
senator
wheeler
noted
that
a
number
of
the
smaller
trucking
companies
were
concerned
about
the
broad
sweep
of
this
antidiscrimination
provision
in
what
is
comparable
to
section
3
that
it
could
be
used
by
railroads
to
claim
that
the
motor
carriers
were
discriminating
against
them
in
the
rates
that
the
motor
carriers
would
buy
out,
that
they
would
be
discriminating
against
the
railroad
rates
to
the
filing
of
the
motor
carrier
rates.
and
senator
wheeler
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
the
discrimination
provisions
relate
to
the
carrier's
patrons
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
carrier's
patrons.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
but
to
make
assurance,
doubly
assure
for
these
small
motor
carriers
that
were
concerned
about
this,
they
put
the
proviso
in
to
deal
with
the
particular
problem
that
was
raised.
that
proviso
subsequently
in
substantially
similar
words
was
then
subsequently
i
think
five
years
later
incorporated
into
what
is
now
section
3.
the
congress
did
not
indicate
when
it
carried
the
proviso
over
into
section
3
a
different
reason
for
placing
it
in
section
3.
and
the
reason
given
in
its
original
enactment
was
to
prevent
harassment
of
contentions
that
a
rate
filed
by
a
carrier
in
effect
discriminated
against
the
rate
filed
by
another
carrier.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
that
is
the
only
material
that
i
was
able
to
look
at
in
the
legislative
history
which
bears
on
the
reason
for
the
proviso
in
either
section
--
either
in
section
3
and
part
i
or
in
the
comparable
provision
in
part
ii,
and
that
i
want
to
make
clear
to
the
court,
senator
wheeler
was
discussing
the
comparable
proviso
in
part
ii
which
was
later
carried
over
in
the
section.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
free
to
affirm
on
section
3?
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
commission
dealt
--
was
dealing
here
with
--
with
a
very
large
case
and
this
is
a
very
substantial
report
that
we
have
here,
some
100
pages
and
we're
talking
about
approximately
ten
of
them
that
directly
relate
to
the
open-tariff
rule.
the
commission
at
page
324
of
its
report
which
is
tipped
in
at
795
of
the
record,
volume
2
of
the
record,
the
commission
discussed
the
various
types
of
rules
that
it
was
proposing.
it
said
some
of
the
rules
to
be
adopted
here
are
simply
interpretive.
we
think
it
will
to
have
them
summarized
and
assembled.
other
rules
take
the
form
of
tariff
and
the
billing
requirements
and
still
others
maybe
said
to
implement
the
broad
provisions
of
existing
regulations.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
on
324
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
--
of
the
commission
report.
then
it
noted
that
some
parties
quarreled
with
their
authority
to
make
rules
particularly
the
latter
type,
the
implementing
type
and
they
referred
to
their
rulemaking
power
under
the
various
parts
of
the
act
and
this
court's
opinion
in
american
trucking
associations
versus
united
states.
i
believe
that
the
open-tariff
rules
that
the
commission
enacted
are
rules
which
implement
the
broad
legislative
provisions.
i
do
not
read
the
commission
report
as
relying
solely
on
section
2.
in
that
portion
of
the
report
where
--
where
it
discusses
section
2,
it
was
discussing
a
number
of
objections
that
were
being
made
to
its
rules
and
the
section
2
discussion
as
i
read
it
was
a
part
of
its
answer
to
particular
objections.
it
was
not
attempting
there
to
set
up
the
rule
and
exclusive
authority.
so
i
--
i
believe
that
section
3
as
well
as
section
1
(4),
section
6,
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
relate
to
what
in
a
--
in
a
shorthand
term
in
our
brief,
we
called
the
common
carrier
obligation
to
serve
all
the
public
on
equal
terms.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
thank
you.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
oh,
i
had
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i
believe
mr.
miller.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
mr.
ginnane
indicated
for
the
motor
carrier
appellants
in
both
numbers
57
and
59.
mr.
ginnane
has
discussed
the
lawfulness
of
the
open-tariff
piggyback
rules
under
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act.
the
district
court
also
concluded
that
the
rules,
the
two
open-tariff
rules
must
fall
because
they
come
into
direct
conflict
with
the
provisions
of
section
216
(c)
of
part
ii
which
relates
to
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
motor
carriers
and
between
motor
carriers
and
rail
and
water
carriers,
and
also
because
of
a
conflict
with
the
provisions
of
part
iv
of
the
act
regulating
freight
forwarders.
the
district
court
and
the
commission
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
red
one.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
district
court
and
the
commission
take
a
basically
different
view
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
and
this
difference
of
view
leads
to
enlarged
measure.
i
think
there
are
different
conclusions
with
respect
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
open-tariff
rules.
the
district
court
looked
at
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
a
rigid
division
of
service
transportation
in
the
four
modes
as
they
are
regulated
by
the
four
roman
numeral
parts
of
the
act
and
it
spoke
of
each
mode
being
confined
to
transportation
by
that
mode
in
terms
of
both
the
--
the
actual
separation
into
four
parts
and
in
terms
of
the
internal
logic
of
the
act,
therefore,
it
concluded
that
a
motor
carrier
is
confined
to
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
unless
there
are
some
special
exception.
the
commission,
however,
as
mr.
ginnane
has
noted
after
reviewing
the
history
of
the
development
of
piggyback
or
trailer-on-flatcar
transportation,
concluded
that
it
is
a
bimodal
service,
it
combines
elements
of
both
rail
and
motor
transportation
as
the
more
formal
name
trailer-on-flatcar
service
that
suggest
two
necessary
elements,
a
trailer
and
a
flatcar
and
the
trailer
is
just
as
essential
to
the
successful
operation
of
the
service
as
the
flatcar.
but
a
bimodal
service
won't
fit
into
the
rigid
modal
pattern
that
the
district
court
suggests
for
the
act.
the
district
court
accepted
the
argument
of
the
appellees
that
trailer-on-flatcar
service
is
a
rail
service.
it
did
not
discuss
and
didn't
specifically
overturn
the
commission's
conclusion
that
it
is
a
bimodal
service.
the
appellees
of
course
do
dispute
it
and
in
their
briefs
they,
they
based
their
arguments
on
the
violations
with
respect
to
section
216
and
part
iv
on
the
theory
that
this
is
a
rail
service
that
we
are
dealing
with.
the
commission
was
in
this
case
dealing
with
a
new
transportation
development
which
combines
elements
of
the
old.
it
combines
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
cannot
be
separated.
if
a
highway
trailer
is
not
used,
trailer-on-flatcar
transportation
simply
will
not
be
successful.
the
whole
theory
of
developing
it
and
its
whole
success
in
this
rapid
growth
that
mr.
ginnane
referred
to
has
been
the
ability
to
transport
a
loader
freight
from
shipper's
door
to
consignee
door
in
the
same
highway
vehicle
without
a
transfer
of
lading
in
route.
the
district
court,
however,
viewing
the
act
as
confining
each
carrier
to
transportation
by
its
separate
mode
absent
some
exception
looked
to
section
216
(c)
covering
the
through
routes
and
joint
rate
arrangements
for
motor
carriers,
as
the
only
possible
exception
to
this
rigid
modal
pattern
which
modal
pattern
would
confine
the
motor
carriers
to
operations
strictly
by
motor
vehicle.
the
district
court
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
no,
the
red
one
sir.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i'm
sorry.
the
district
court
said
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
did
not
dispute
the
premise
of
the
appellees'
arguments
below
that
a
de
facto
through
routes
is
created
when
a
motor
carrier
utilizes
a
rail
movement
under
an
open
rail
tariff.
actually,
an
answer
to
that
argument
as
it
was
made
to
the
commission,
it
said
that
what
is
a
through
route
is
a
matter
of
fact
and
it's
cited
among
other
cases
thompson
versus
u.s.,
343
u.s.
being
a
question
of
fact
what
is
a
through
a
route
is
not
subject
to
any
general
rule
but
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances.
in
thompson,
this
court
said
that
the
test
of
a
through
route
is
whether
the
participating
carriers
hold
themselves
out
as
offering
a
through
transportation
service.
the
district
court
compared
the,
what
it
called,
the
operative
features
of
the
plan
i
which
everybody
with
one
possible
exception
on
the
side,
the
appellees
concedes
is
a
valid
through
route-joint
rate
arrangements
between
a
railroad
and
a
motor
carrier.
and
the
motor
carrier
participation
in
trailer-on-flatcar
service
under
the
commission's
proposed
open-tariff
rules.
it
concluded
--
the
only
difference
is
the
consent
of
the
railroads.
and
if
the
consent
is
lacking,
i
think
all
parties
agree
the
216
(c)
would
preclude
the
through
route
arrangement.
but
the
test
of
a
through
route
as
the
court
said
in
thompson
is
whether
the
carriers
hold
themselves
out
to
perform
a
through
service.
when
a
motor
carrier
under
its
own
billing
secures
a
trailer
load
of
freight
takes
it
to
a
railroad
raft
and
under
a
railroad
tariff
holding
out
a
ramp-to-ramp
plan
iii
service
offers
that
trailer
to
the
railroad,
picks
it
up
at
the
terminal
ramp
of
the
rail
run,
carries
it
onto
the
ultimate
customer
and
delivers
it,
the
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
are
not
holding
out
a
through
service.
the
railroad
tariff
covers
only
the
rail
movement
between
the
ramps.
the
rail
bill
of
lading
is
with
the
motor
carrier.
the
rail
has
no
contract
with
the
shipper.
the
railroad
rate
for
this
rail
portion
of
the
service
is
determined
by
itself,
the
rules
and
regulations
which
cover
the
applicability
of
the
service
are
set
by
the
railroad
in
a
--
through
route
arrangement
under
a
plan
i
operation
or
a
conventional
plan
v
operation.
the
participating
carriers
joining
together
and
holding
out
the
through
route
joined
together
and
determine
the
rate
that
is
to
be
applied
on
the
through
transportation.
the
bill
of
lading
which
the
shipper
covers
the
entire
shipment
and
both
the
rail
and
the
motor
carrier
are
obligated
to
the
shipper
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
entire
transportation
service.
the
differences
in
the
obligations
and
liabilities
are
set
at
in
our
brief,
the
--
essentially
the
--
under
a
through
route
arrangement,
be
the
railroad
or
motor
carrier
is
liable
to
the
shipper
for
the
proper
completion
of
the
trip
and
for
any
loss
or
damage
that
may
occur.
now,
the
motor
carrier
is
the
only
one
who
contracts
with
the
shipper.
the
railroad's
contract
is
exclusively
with
motor
carrier
and
only
for
the
rail
portion
of
the
trailer.
the
railroad
is
not
liable
to
the
shipper
for
this
removal.
the
district
court
assumed
that
there
is
a
de
facto
through
route
created
and
dealt
with
the
question
of
compulsion
and
as
i
said,
if
there
is
a
through
route
created,
then
it
cannot
be
compelled
under
section
216
(c)
because
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
motor
carrier
of
property
or
between
motor
carriers
of
property
and
railroads
are
permissive
under
216
(c),
but
when
there
is
no
through
route
involved,
there
is
no
compulsion
on
the
railroad
entering
a
through
route.
the
only
compulsion
that
there
is
and
this
is
the
compulsion
mentioned
in
the
commission's
report
is
to
hold
out
its
service.
the
commission
said
there's
no
compulsion
on
the
railroad
either
to
provide
this
trailer-on-flatcar
service
or
on
the
motor
carrier
to
make
use
of.
the
only
compulsion
there
is
on
the
railroad
where
it
holds
out
its
service
to
the
public
in
an
open-tariff
to
serve
the
public
without
discrimination,
without
attempting
to
select
among
the
shippers
that
it
will
serve.
the
other
aspect
of
the
district
court
case
which
deals
with
a
direct
conflict
between
the
open-tariff
rules
and
provisions
of
the
act
are
those
really
in
part
iv
of
the
act
relating
to
the
regulation
of
freight
forwarders.
now,
the
district
court
in
its
decision
only
considered
the
extreme
case,
it
spoke
of
a
carrier
who
performed
only
an
assembly
in
distribution
service
and
use
another
carrier
to
perform
the
entire
transportation
service.
it
spoke
of
a
carrier
who's
--
who's
only
tied
with
the
motor
carrier
operation
with
an
unexercised
certificate.
but
the
commission
specifically
said
that
where
a
motor
carrier
holds
out
to
perform
only
this,
an
assembly
in
distribution
service
and
uses
an
underlying
transportation
company
between
points
that
it
itself
cannot
serve
in
a
practicable
manner,
then
no
doubt
in
the
commission's
own
line,
it
would
be
acting
a
forwarder
and
not
as
a
carrier
itself.
there
is
a
specific
section
of
the
commission's
report
which
was
not
discussed
in
the
district
court
opinion
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
the
abandonment
of
service
by
motor
carriers
at
authorized
points
through
the
use
of
trailer-on-flatcar
transportation.
a
rule
had
been
suggested
which
would
have
set
requirements
for
actual
operations
over
the
highway.
the
commission
considered
the
rule.
it
noted
its
power
under
section
204
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
to
regulate
motor
carriers
and
to
that
end
to
establish
reasonable
requirements
with
respect
to
continuous
and
adequate
service.
it
noted
in
fact
that
every
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
to
a
motor
carrier
by
it
carries
forward
this
requirement
as
to
the
performance
of
a
reasonably
continuous
and
adequate
service.
based
on
it's
consideration
of
it's
power
under
the
act
and
under
the
condition
that
they
have
put
in
the
certificate,
the
commission
found
it
unnecessary
to
prescribe
an
additional
rule
relating
to
the
motor
carrier
performance
of
an
adequate
service
over
the
highway
where
it
were
--
was
also
using
the
trailer-on-flatcar
service
between
the
points.
it
clearly,
in
that
discussion
showed
that
it
would
not
permit
a
motor
carrier
to
operate
as
the
--
in
the
court's
example
and
the
only
example
the
court
used
that
is
to
pre
--
stop
carrying
itself
on
the
highway
and
only
perform
an
assembly
in
distribution
service.
under
sections
402
(a)
(5)
of
the
act,
a
freight
forwarder
is
defined
as
a
person
who
otherwise
and
as
a
carrier
subject
to
part
i,
part
ii
or
part
iii
holds
out
to
transport
or
to
provide
transportation
in
a
certain
manner.
part
i,
part
ii,
and
part
iii
of
course
are
the
three
parts
that
covered
the
--
the
physical
modes
of
carriage,
railroads,
motor
carriers
and
water
carriers.
that
language
had
parenthetical
exclusory
language
otherwise
than
as
a
carrier
subject
to
part
i,
ii
or
iii,
is
recognition
by
congress
that
there
are
operational
similarities
between
what
freight
forwarders
do
and
--
in
our
example
that
we
are
using,
what
motor
carriers
do.
and
it
is
a
recognition
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
carve
out
a
--
an
exclusive
area
of
operation
for
the
freight
forwarder.
these
operational
similarities,
motor
carriers
for
years
have
assembled
small
shipments
into
volume
shipments
or
trailer
load
shipments
for
movement
and
perform
distribution
service.
as
long
as
a
motor
carrier
is
acting
as
a
motor
carrier
and
holds
out
the
motor
carrier
service
over
the
highway,
we
submit
that
the
definition
of
the
freight
forwarder
and
particularly
noting
the
exclusory
language
does
not
say
that
a
motor
carrier
becomes
a
forwarder
simply
because
it
may
use
trailer-on-flatcar
service
in
the
performance
of
some
of
its
authorized
service.
i
must
again
mention
some
of
the
horrible
examples
of
what
might
happen
where
these
rules
adopted
that
the
appellees
have
included
in
their
brief.
most
of
these
examples
have
been
referred
to
and
--
and
primarily
they
are
directed
to
either
the
question
of
aggravating
an
imbalance
of
operation
for
the
railroad
or
pushing
off
on
to
the
railroad
undesirable
or
traffic
--
or
traffic
which
is
difficult
to
handle.
the
thing
is
that
this
happens
right
today.
this
is
one
of
the
--
the
necessary
incidence
of
performing
a
transportation
service
that
all
transportation
agencies
deal
with.
we
all
have
imbalances
of
operations.
we
all
have
the
balloon
freight
or
the
--
the
oversized
freight
that
we
have
to
handle.
as
to
the
railroad's
open-tariff,
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
today
a
private
carrier,
a
shipper
as
mr.
ginnane
explain
who
uses
his
own
motor
vehicle
to
transport
his
freight,
he
can
decide
that
he
does
not
want
to
send
his
drivers
out
on
the
weekend
and
he
would
rather
take
a
group
of
his
trailers
which
normally
he
would
send
over
the
highway
with
his
own
equipment
taking
down
to
the
railroad
station
and
put
them
on
the
railroad
and
let
the
railroad
carry
it.
obviously,
all
private
carriers
are
--
are
reasonable
and
intelligent
businessmen,
the
difficult
to
handle
freights,
the
freight
which
is
more
expensive
to
carry,
they
will
if
possible
shipped
by
a
for
hire
carrier
and
they
will
tend
to
utilize
themselves,
their
own
equipment
in
as
much
as
possible
a
balanced
economical
operation.
and
of
course
freight
forwarders
and
shippers
associations,
shippers
associations
operating
in
much
the
same
manner
as
freight
forwarders
but
under
partial
exemptions
from
economic
regulations,
they
have
a
choice
of
the
carriers
they
may
use.
they
may
decide
because
of
weather
conditions,
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
examples
suggested
that
they
will
take
a
majority
of
their
trailers
that
are
ready
to
move
to
the
railroad
instead
of
shipping
them
by
some
other
means.
all
of
these
happens
today
and
of
course,
as
mr.
ginnane
said
we
view
the
problems
whether
they
are
caused
by
motor
carriers
making
use
of
the
trailer-on-flatcar
service
or
as
they
exist
already
in
the
railroad
operations,
with
a
consideration
of
reasonableness,
no
favored
shipper
of
a
railroad
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
down
friday
afternoon
with
an
additional
hundred
trailers
and
get
them
moved
out.
if
the
carrier
does
not
have
the
facilities
available,
it
calls
for
planning,
it
calls
for
cooperation,
it
calls
for
advance
notice.
mr.
ginnane
mentioned
the
compensatory
rates.
the
commission
in
its
report
at
page
329
points
out
that
a
number
of
the
people
who
had
supported
the
open-tariff
trailer-on-flatcar
rules
had
asked
why
should
a
railroad
object
to
receiving
additional
business,
that
question
still
hasn't
been
answered.
and
assuming
that
the
railroad
rates
for
this
service
are
compensatory
and
this
is
a
minimum
requirement
for
lawfulness
of
rate
is
that
it
be
compensatory,
additional
business
should
mean
additional
profit.
if
the
rates
are
too
low,
they
attract
this
traffic
now.
no
shipper
is
going
to
remain
loyal
indefinitely
to
a
motor
transportation
if
it
can
secure
a
comparable
service
at
a
lower
cost
from
another
mode
and
we
are
dealing
here
with
comparable
services.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
sir?
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i
--
i've
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
rail
itself
is
authorized
within
the
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
--
the
terminal
areas,
but
a
number
of
railroads
--
well,
let
me
say
that
of
course
under
216
(c),
a
railroad
and
a
motor
carrier
may
voluntarily
enter
into
a
--
a
through
route
arrangement
and
end-to-end
arrangement
where
the
--
the
motor
carrier
would
carry
beyond
the
railroad.
a
number
of
the
railroads
almost
since
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
act
in
1935
have
been
securing
themselves
or
through
affiliates.
motor
carrier
operating
authority
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
motor
carrier
operating
authority
certificates
or
permits,
it
would
have
to
be
certificates
in
the
example
that
you're
talking
about,
as
common
carriers
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i
don't
know
whether
other
than
with
their
own
affiliate
motor
carriers,
railroads
are
securing
such
a
service.
i
think
that
the
reasoning
that
mr.
ginnane
used
so
far
as
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act
are
eminently
correct,
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
i
do
not
believe
a
motor
carrier
could
decide
to
accept
a
shipment
or
not
depending
on
who
the
shipper
was.
if
the
shipper
meets
the
tariff
requirements
for
the
shipment
then
the
motor
carrier
just
as
the
railroads
should
have
no
concern
about
whether
it
is
a
railroad
who
is
shipping.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes
sir.
the
--
any
discrimination
provisions
are
comparable
in
the
two
parts
of
the
act
and
they
apply
with
the
equal
force.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
here
was
carrying
out
its
duty
to
administer
and
enforce
the
act
in
the
light
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
particularly
the
--
the
end
objective
of
that
policy
is
to
develop,
coordinate,
and
preserve
the
national
transportation
system.
here
the
commission
was
dealing
with
a
new
and
explosive
development
in
transportation,
new
and
combining
two
elements
of
the
old
by
creating
something
apart
from
the
modal
divisions
that
have
been
known
before.
and
this
new
development
has
caused
a
substantial
alteration
in
our
transportation
system.
now,
the
motor
carrier
who
historically
was
the
carrier
who
had
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
flexibility
of
providing
a
door-to-door
service
is
meant
with
competition
in
the
provision
of
a
substantially
similar
service
by
railroads
and
by
freight
forwarders.
what
this
meant
was
more
than
this
because
while
the
railroads
and
the
freight
forwarders
can
utilize
this
new
bimodal
transportation
service,
the
motor
carrier
may
make
use
of
it
because
of
past
commission
decisions
only
at
the
sufferance
of
the
railroads,
only
under
the
permissive
through
route
and
through
rate
arrangements
of
section
216
(c)
where
he
has
to
get
the
railroad's
consent.
the
commission
here
recognized
the
bimodality
of
the
service.
it
recognized
that
all
carriers
should
be
equally
allowed
to
participate
in
it
without
restriction.
if
the
district
court
position
on
the
--
the
sharp
modal
separation
in
the
act
is
actually
followed
through
and
the
rules
as
it
said
must
stand
or
fall
despite
of
altered
circumstances
in
the
transportation
industry
that
the
logic
of
that
modal
division
should
preclude
railroads
from
making
use
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service
because
if
the
motor
carrier
is
not
providing
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
when
it
participates
in
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
the
railroad
is
not
providing
transportation
by
train
when
it
makes
use
of
a
service,
the
key
element
of
which
is
a
highway
vehicle
which
it
moves
over
the
highway
and
is
utilized
to
provide
a
door
to
door
movement
without
transfer
of
lading.
unfortunately,
from
the
motor
carrier
point
of
view,
in
1954
in
the
trailer,
then
what
is
called
the
new
haven
case
in
293
icc,
the
commission
considered
the
question
of
--
a
number
of
questions
relating
to
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
it
did
not
have
a
record,
it
made
its
decision
on
a
basis
of
questions
that
were
presented,
in
briefs,
and
in
oral
argument.
without
a
record
before,
the
commission
held
that
a
railroad
may
utilize
trailer-on-flatcar
service.
and
the
railroads
have
exploited
that
use
of
that
--
this
bimodal
transportation
service
to
divert
a
substantial
quantity
of
rate
for
the
motor
carriers
as
the
commission's
report
shows.
what
the
commission
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
case
ultimately
comes
down
to
restoring
the
competitive
balance.
the
railroads
have
had
an
opportunity
to
make
use
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
motor
carrier
for
years
to
divert
traffic
from
it.
the
railroads
have
been
able
to
limit
or
actually
preclude
motor
carrier
use
of
this
bimodal
service.
the
commission
here
simply
seeks
to
permit
the
motor
carriers
to
share
in
the
use
of
this
bimodal
service.
with
the
court's
permission,
we
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
exemption
in
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
section
3,
the
proviso
relating
to
the
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
--
the
traffic.
we
referred
to
the
remarks
of
senator
wheeler
when
a
comparable
proviso
was
being
put
into
the
--
the
provision
in
the
motor
carrier
part
of
the
act.
and
senator
wheeler
noted
that
a
number
of
the
smaller
trucking
companies
were
concerned
about
the
broad
sweep
of
this
antidiscrimination
provision
in
what
is
comparable
to
section
3
that
it
could
be
used
by
railroads
to
claim
that
the
motor
carriers
were
discriminating
against
them
in
the
rates
that
the
motor
carriers
would
buy
out,
that
they
would
be
discriminating
against
the
railroad
rates
to
the
filing
of
the
motor
carrier
rates.
and
senator
wheeler
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
the
discrimination
provisions
relate
to
the
carrier's
patrons
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
carrier's
patrons.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
but
to
make
assurance,
doubly
assure
for
these
small
motor
carriers
that
were
concerned
about
this,
they
put
the
proviso
in
to
deal
with
the
particular
problem
that
was
raised.
that
proviso
subsequently
in
substantially
similar
words
was
then
subsequently
i
think
five
years
later
incorporated
into
what
is
now
section
3.
the
congress
did
not
indicate
when
it
carried
the
proviso
over
into
section
3
a
different
reason
for
placing
it
in
section
3.
and
the
reason
given
in
its
original
enactment
was
to
prevent
harassment
of
contentions
that
a
rate
filed
by
a
carrier
in
effect
discriminated
against
the
rate
filed
by
another
carrier.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
that
is
the
only
material
that
i
was
able
to
look
at
in
the
legislative
history
which
bears
on
the
reason
for
the
proviso
in
either
section
--
either
in
section
3
and
part
i
or
in
the
comparable
provision
in
part
ii,
and
that
i
want
to
make
clear
to
the
court,
senator
wheeler
was
discussing
the
comparable
proviso
in
part
ii
which
was
later
carried
over
in
the
section.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
free
to
affirm
on
section
3?
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
the
commission
dealt
--
was
dealing
here
with
--
with
a
very
large
case
and
this
is
a
very
substantial
report
that
we
have
here,
some
100
pages
and
we're
talking
about
approximately
ten
of
them
that
directly
relate
to
the
open-tariff
rule.
the
commission
at
page
324
of
its
report
which
is
tipped
in
at
795
of
the
record,
volume
2
of
the
record,
the
commission
discussed
the
various
types
of
rules
that
it
was
proposing.
it
said
some
of
the
rules
to
be
adopted
here
are
simply
interpretive.
we
think
it
will
to
have
them
summarized
and
assembled.
other
rules
take
the
form
of
tariff
and
the
billing
requirements
and
still
others
maybe
said
to
implement
the
broad
provisions
of
existing
regulations.

commission
report.
then
it
noted
that
some
parties
quarreled
with
their
authority
to
make
rules
particularly
the
latter
type,
the
implementing
type
and
they
referred
to
their
rulemaking
power
under
the
various
parts
of
the
act
and
this
court's
opinion
in
american
trucking
associations
versus
united
states.
i
believe
that
the
open-tariff
rules
that
the
commission
enacted
are
rules
which
implement
the
broad
legislative
provisions.
i
do
not
read
the
commission
report
as
relying
solely
on
section
2.
in
that
portion
of
the
report
where
--
where
it
discusses
section
2,
it
was
discussing
a
number
of
objections
that
were
being
made
to
its
rules
and
the
section
2
discussion
as
i
read
it
was
a
part
of
its
answer
to
particular
objections.
it
was
not
attempting
there
to
set
up
the
rule
and
exclusive
authority.
so
i
--
i
believe
that
section
3
as
well
as
section
1
(4),
section
6,
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
relate
to
what
in
a
--
in
a
shorthand
term
in
our
brief,
we
called
the
common
carrier
obligation
to
serve
all
the
public
on
equal
terms.
mr.
richard
r.

thank
you.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
oh,
i
had
--
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
i
believe
mr.
miller.
mr.
richard
r.
sigmon
yes
sir.
