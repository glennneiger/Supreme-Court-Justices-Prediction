mr.
miller,
what
is
the
practical
reason
why
the
railroads
don't
want
to
accept
this
business
in
the
truck
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
compel
this
service?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
urge
mr.
chief
justice
that
congress
has
provided
in
section
216
(c)
for
voluntary
establishment
of
coordinated
transportation
between
motor
carriers
and
railroads.
and
this
question
of
the
manner
on
which
this
coordination
can
be
affected
has
risen
in
these
lines
of
cases
that
i
mentioned,
in
the
parker
case
where
the
problem
was
the
extent
to
which
authority
should
be
granted
to
railroad
motor
carrier
subsidiaries.
they
have
to
consider
in
the
process
of
determining
whether
grants
of
that
authority
was
warranted
in
the
public
interest.
what
kinds
of
coordination
could
be
created?
and
in
parker,
the
court
said,
following
a
number
of
decisions
by
the
commission
that
the
--
there
was
no
way
to
compel
motor
carrier
and
railroad
coordination.
it
could
only
be
done
on
a
voluntary
basis
under
section
216
(c)
that
that
was
the
congressional
policy
in
the
area.
and
in
that
case,
therefore,
they
granted
certain
limited
motor
carrier
rights
to
the
railroad
subsidiaries
in
order
to
affect
this
kind
of
transportation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
also
--
it
can
also
establish
a
higher
rate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
legislation
that
was
referred
to
by
the
counsel
mr.
shea
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
--
we
know
that
legislation
bears
the
issue
of
through
to
whether
the
present
act
gives
you
the
authority
to
issue?
