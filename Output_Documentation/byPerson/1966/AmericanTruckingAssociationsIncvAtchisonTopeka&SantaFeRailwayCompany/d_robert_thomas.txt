mr.
d.
robert
thomas
is
there
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
any
distinction
between
the
piggyback
and
the
car
loading,
boat
carload?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
mean
forwarder.
does
he
tender
to
you
a
full
car?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
you
wouldn't
know
what's
in
the
car
if
it's
the
car
load?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
isn't
that
a
--
is
he
a
shipper?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
represent
these
freight
forwarder
appellees
in
this
case.
my
clients
are
the
ones
who
are
entirely
recognized
as
having
a
right
to
ship
and
so
recognized
in
the
statute.
these
new
rules
provide
for
an
invasion
of
that
mode
of
operation
and
that's
the
primary
basis
of
the
concern
of
my
clients
here.
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
decision
below
was
that
the
rules
do
violate
one
of
its
parts
and
sections
of
part
iv
of
the
act
which
regulates
freight
forwarding
and
moreover,
they
violate
the
direct
intentions
of
congress
to
keep
motor
carriers
and
railroads
too,
and
water
carriers
out
of
the
freight
forwarding
business.
now,
i
do
want
to
explain
furthermore
to
what
the
forwarder
does.
a
question
came
up
just
a
moment
ago
about
that.
the
forwarder
company
operates
by
making
shipments
over
these
regulated
common
carriers.
this
operation
of
making
shipments
is
the
distinctive
characteristic
of
freight
forwarder
operation.
the
statute
permits
the
freight
forwarder
to
have
his
own
motor
vehicles
inside
and
operate
them
inside
a
terminal
area
such
as
new
york
city
or
washington
but
not
to
operate
any
of
the
line
or
haul
transportation
in
between
the
terminals.
what
the
forwarder
does
is
to
assemble
the
shipments
inside
one
of
the
terminal
areas
and
he
can
do
that
with
his
trucks
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
and
then
he
takes
them
and
forms
a
carload
shipment
out
of
those.
he
puts
these
small
shipments
together
and
he
consolidates
them
as
the
general
word,
and
he
makes
a
carload
shipment
and
then
he
tenders
that
shipment
to
a
common
carrier
and
it's
almost
always
a
railroad
for
the
distances.
he
tenders
that
to
a
common
carrier
under
the
common
carrier's
tariff
rates.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
yes,
carload
rates.
now
the
carload
rates
of
course
--
the
carload
rate
for
a
single
carload
is
less
than
the
total
amount
of
the
rates
for
each
of
these
individual
shipments
and
the
forwarder
pays
his
own
expenses
and
he
makes
his
profit
by
that
spread
between
the
rates.
his
own
rates,
the
forwarders'
own
rates
must
be
just
and
reasonable
to
the
shipper
of
the
small
goods.
they
are
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
they
must
be
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
railroad
can
do
and
by
--
and
the
motor
carrier,
your
honor,
and
the
water
carrier
can
all
do
the
same
job
in
this
respect.
each
of
them
can
operate
with
the
pick
up
and
delivery
service
in
the
terminal
area
and
they
do.
there
are
certain
limitations
in
different
places
but
that's
typical.
each
one
of
them
does
it.
but
when
the
railroad
collects
those
small
shipments
that
it
has,
it
takes
them
and
handles
them
in
its
own
rail
service.
when
the
motor
carrier
collects
them,
it's
authorized
to
handle
them
in
the
part
ii
type
of
service
and
when
the
water
carrier
collects
them,
it
takes
them
by
water
and
down
to
the
destination,
and
then
it
comes
to
delivery.
the
distinction
and
the
difference
between
the
freight
forwarder
mode
and
the
thing
that
congress
has
called
and
recognized
in
part
iv,
has
stated
in
part
iv,
to
be
what
it
calls
the
inherent
nature
of
freight
forwarding.
the
inherent
nature
of
freight
forwarding
is
not
this
matter
of
the
collection
of
the
shipments
at
each
hand
because
all
carriers
do
that.
the
distinctive
nature
of
freight
forwarding
and
within
the
essence
of
the
trouble
that
these
rules
get
into
is
that
the
nature
of
freight
forwarding
is
to
take
those
shipments
that
it
collects,
combine
them
and
then
ship
them
on
an
operating
carrier,
but
we
are
not
an
operating
carrier.
we
ship
over
an
operating
carrier
and
freight
forwarders
are
the
only
mode
of
operation
of
a
transportation
agency
of
which
there
is
a
statutory
provision
for
that
method
of
operation.
that
statute
is
in
part
iv,
provides
that
freight
forwarders
may
utilize
the
services
of
a
railroad
or
of
a
motor
carrier
or
a
water
carrier
“for
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
transportation
of
such
shipments”,
and
that
is
not
in
anyone
of
the
rest
of
the
sections.
and
moreover,
it's
entirely
clear
if
we
looked
to
the
congressional
history
of
what
congress
intended
that
congress
expressly
when
it
enacted
part
iv,
expressly
decided
and
deliberately
stated
that
it
did
not
want
these
carriers
by
railroad
or
carriers
by
motor
carrier
or
carriers
by
water
carrier
to
be
engaging
in
freight
forwarding
which
is
the
matter
of
the
shipping
between
the
terminals.
i
see
it's
12,
so
i
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
see.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
mentioning
before
the
recess
that
congress
had
deliberately
examined
and
made
its
own
conclusion
as
to
whether
these
other
carriers
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
the
freight
forwarding
mode.
the
freight
forwarder
act
was
adopted
in
1942
and
in
the
legislative
history
preceding
that,
the
principal
report
which
was
reflected
in
the
final
form
of
the
bill
was
a
report
made
by
the
house
of
representatives
committee.
that
deliberate
--
that
committee
deliberately
took
up
this
question
about
the
relationship
of
the
freight
forwarder
mode
with
the
other
carriers.
and
the
committee
started
off
its
report
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
or
saying
that
forwarders
perform
a
unique
type
of
transportation
service.
and
then
on
the
first
page
also,
it
mentioned
that
forwarders,
they
utilize
the
services
of
rail,
motor
and
water
carriers
and
ship
by
whatever
means
is
the
best
way
to
do
the
shipping
and
that's
what
makes
their
form
of
operation
unique.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
yes,
mr.
justice.
as
freight
forwarders,
this
affects
us
in
--
in
--
in
one
or
two
or
three
different
kinds
of
very
sharp
ways.
one
is
it
permits
the
motor
carriers
and
the
water
carrier
but
particularly
the
motor
carriers
they
are
our
primary
competitors.
it
permits
them
to
offer
the
shippers
throughout
the
country
the
type
of
operation
that
the
freight
forwarders
have
been
operating
under
the
method
of
shipping
by
rail.
the
rules
themselves
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
it
does
exactly
that,
your
honor.
it
makes
them
--
every
one
of
these
water
carriers,
it
makes
them
a
freight
forwarder.
they
can
choose
under
the
rules
as
the
commission
sets
them
up,
it
gives
the
motor
carriers
who
up
to
now
have
been
operating
--
required
to
operate
under
the
act
and
intended
by
congress
to
operate
as
motor
carriers
in
the
ways
the
part
ii
describes
or
water
carriers
in
this
similar
kind
of
way.
it
gives
each
one
of
them
the
option
to
add
on
to
that
another
mode
of
operation
which
is
the
freight
forwarder
mode.
in
other
words
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
exactly.
now,
all
of
them
can
gather
and
all
of
them
do
and
all
of
them
have
historically
gathered
these
small
shipments
but
then
comes
the
way
in
which
they
get
it
from
this
concentration
point
over
to
the
destination
concentration
point
and
that's
what
we
have
the
distinction
in
the
different
modes
of
operation.
the
forwarders
do
what
their
name
implies
really.
they
forward
the
shipment
by
shipping
it
over
other
carriers.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
but
that
has
not
been
the
method
of
operation
of
the
other
carriers,
motor
carriers
or
railroads.
they
do
not
ship
and
they
are
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
forwarders
and
to
act
as
forwarders
and
to
--
and
to
ship.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
the
congress,
in
drawing
up
the
act,
came
to
that
expressed
conclusion.
the
word
it
expressed
in
the
committee
report
was
that
it
came
to
a
conclusion
that
there
should
be
a
policy
and
i'm
quoting,
“of
not
permitting”
this
is
in
quotes,
“of
not
permitting
them
--”
that
is
the
railroads
and
the
motor
carriers
and
the
freight
--
and
the
water
carriers
“--
to
engage
directly
in
the
freight
forwarding
business.”
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
and
the
reason
why
they
--
so
they
came
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
freight
--
there
is
a
difference
in
freight
rates,
your
honor,
yes.
what
the
--
the
--
both
of
those
are
services
held
up
by
the
railroads.
they
hold
up
the
boxcar
service
and
the
forwarders
use
the
boxcar
for
the
service
for
much
of
the
service.
they
have
in
the
past,
historically,
as
a
railroad
puts
in
piggyback
service
and
holds
that
out,
the
forwarders
are
able
to
use
that
lower
rate
basis
to
what
applies
to
the
piggyback
service.
they
either
--
the
forwarder
either
puts
the
goods
in
the
boxcar
or
consigns
that
to
the
destination
where
it
puts
the
goods
in
trailers.
it
takes
you
--
they
took
trailers
to
make
up
the
carload
shipment
and
consigns
that
to
the
destination.
so
that
the
forwarder
will
do
is
use
both
boxcar
service
and
the
tofc
service.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
typically,
yes.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
yes
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
that's
considered
to
be
a
carload
lot.
and
that
is
the
tendering
and
the
rate
typically
applies.
there
are
some
exceptions,
but
the
typical
basis
is
the
tendering
of
two
trailers
on
a
single
carload
and
then
of
course
ties
in
with
the
economy
a
little
bit
but
there
is
room
for
them
on
the
typical
flatcar.
and
on
the
typical
basis,
the
two
trailers
or
two
containers
without
wheels
constitute
the
one
carload
lot.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
am
against
mr.
ginnane
in
this
because
mr.
ginnane
argues
as
i
do
that
this
thing,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
emphasized
that
these
rules
would
make
shippers
and
forwarders
--
he
didn't
say
forwarders,
but
he
said
these
rules
would
make
shippers
out
of
the
motor
carriers
that
they
would
be
acting
as
shippers,
your
honor.
the
other
day,
last
thursday,
he
emphasized
that
strongly.
they'd
be
acting
as
shippers
or
patrons
of
the
railroads
and
that's
the
way
they
would
operate
if
these
rules
went
into
effect
but
when
they
become
shippers
and
this
is
where
i'd
part
company
with
mr.
ginnane,
when
they
act
as
shippers,
they
are
no
longer
acting
in
the
way
in
which
they
are
authorized
by
the
congress
to
act
in
the
mode
of
operation
for
motor
carriers.
when
they
become
shippers
your
honor,
they
are
then
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
exactly
and
that's
what
congress
intended.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
ship.
they
are
allowed
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
your
honor,
they
--
as
a
--
it
is
in
a
matter
of
discrimination,
i
think
on
that
and
the
discrimination
runs
in
a
different
kind
of
direction.
it
is
a
wholly
different
form
that
congress
for
example
prohibited.
there
is
a
section
in
the
freight
forwarding
act
that
actually
prohibits
these
people
from
becoming
--
from
being
--
pardon.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
motor
carriers
and
the
railroads
and
water
carriers
from
being
permitted
by
the
commission
to
operate
or
to
have
--
to
have
as
freight
forwarders.
the
commission
made
no
reference
to
that
in
its
report.
it's
a
result
of
this
policy,
that
provision
of
section
410
(c)
and
that's
at
the
back
of
our
brief
--
is
in
the
act
that
forbids
the
granting
of
any
freight
forwarding
permit
to
these
water
carriers
and
railroads
and
those
are
the
only
persons
that
congress
has
forbidden
the
commission
to
grant
a
freight
forwarding
permit
to.
and
yet,
as
mr.
ginnane
said,
operating
under
these
rules,
these
people
that
is
the
motor
carriers,
the
water
carriers,
and
the
railroad
--
they're
talking
again
the
rules
about
motor
carriers
and
water
carriers,
would
be
acting
as
shippers
and
as
patrons,
it
would
be
allowed
to
by
the
commission
and
permitted
to
by
the
commission.
and
when
they
are
allowed
to
do
that
by
he
commission
and
permitted
to
do
it,
they
were
then
being
permitted
by
the
commission
to
do
exactly
what
congress
have
said
the
commission
shall
not
grant
them
with
the
authority
to
do
it
and
that
is
to
make
their
operations
in
the
freight
forwarding
way.
they
carry
on
freight
forwarding.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
we
do
not
go
along
with
the
--
with
the
--
or
the
truckers.
the
truckers
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no.
the
only
way
we
go
along
with
the
truckers
is
that
i
think
the
truckers
also
go
along
with
mr.
ginnane
in
saying
that
--
that
these
rules
would
make
shippers
out
of
the
motor
carriers
and
they
said,
that's
alright
with
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
most
of
the
way,
your
honor,
but
not
entirely
all
because
to
us,
we
read
the
commission's
report
and
the
provisions
here
as
providing
for
a
right
of
shipping
and
not
a
matter
--
making
a
matter
of
a
through
route.
that
gives
these
rules
would
give
the
right
to
ship.
the
commission
treated
them
that
way
in
its
report
and
by
giving
them
the
right
to
ship
that
puts
it
over
in
the
situation
where
it
--
the
territory,
the
congress
forbad
to
them,
the
freight
forwarder
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would.
and
for
this
reason,
if
these
rules
go
into
effect
like
this
as
they
are
intended
to
be
and
the
area
of
shipping
on
the
tariff
rates
is
then
thrown
open
to
the
motor
carriers
who
are
very
strong
competitors
of
the
railroads
as
well
as
of
the
--
of
the
freight
forwarders,
the
impact
on
us
is
up
to
be
either
in
whole
or
in
part
exactly
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
mr.
ginnane
in
his
brief
has
referred
to.
he
has
said
that
the
railroads
could
comply
with
these
rules
by
cancelling
the
tariff
rates
or
piggyback
shipping
and
that
would
be
a
full
compliance
with
these
rules
and
if
--
if
that
happened,
our
people,
our
freight
forwarders
would
be
entirely
out
of
piggybacking
because
we
cannot
do
anything
except
ship
on
tariff
rates,
and
yet
the
motor
carriers
can
make
these
joint
rates
under
section
216
(c),
they
can
--
they
can
make
joint
rates
and
joint
through
route
arrangements
with
the
railroads
and
the
motor
carriers
would
then
be
competing
by
providing
piggyback
service
for
their
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
and
we
would
--
we
would
be
cut
out.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
it
has
a
very
serious
impact
on
us
because
it
would
be
--
it
has
less
impact
on
us
your
honor.
it
also
has
the
similar
impact
on
the
private
shipper
who
ships
his
own
goods
over
the
railroad.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
joint
rate
arrangement
is
permissible.
the
only
way
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
oh!
yes,
yes
in
any
way
--
indeed,
yes
--
we're
--
they're
competing
with
us
and
the
motor
carrier
has
the
--
has
a
right
now
and
if
he
does
compete
very,
very
successful,
he
is
big
and
where
our
freight
forwarders
are
small.
he
gets
the
traffic
because
he
has
the
authority
to
carry
the
traffic
over
the
road
in
his
own
trucks
or
to
make
these
joint
arrangements
with
the
railroads
under
section
216
(c).
he
can
make
either
one
of
them.
but
what
he
does
not
have
now
and
the
only
thing
that
we
have,
the
forwarders
have
is
the
right
to
ship
as
a
shipper
over
the
railroad,
not
if
you
--
if
you
were
to
add,
if
the
commission
adds
as
it
proposes
to
do,
to
add
the
one
advantage,
the
only
way
of
operation
that
the
freight
forwarder
is
allowed
to
operate,
add
that
on
to
what
the
motor
carrier
already
has,
you
make
a
tremendous
multi
service
group
out
of
the
motor
carriers
and
exactly
contrary
to
what
congress
itself
had
said
it
did
not
intend
to
do.
it
did
not
have
the
policy,
establish
the
policy
of
not
permitting
these
other
carriers
to
get
into
the
freight
forwarding
field,
and
then
wrote
into
the
act
the
provision
which
forbids
the
commission
from
granting
a
freight
forwarding
permit
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
to
any
of
the
carriers.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
moving
under
--
that
traffic
is
moving
under
a
joint
through
rate
arrangement,
they
are
not
acting
as
--
as
freight
forwarders.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
but
right
now
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
right
now,
as
always,
the
motor
carrier
can
collect
shipments
in
new
york,
put
them
in
his
own
trucks
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
and
pick
them
on
the
road.
no
your
honor,
the
impact
is
quite
different
because
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
it
cuts
into
our
business
but
it
leaves
open
to
us
as
long
as
it's
a
matter
of
the
--
of
a
through
rate
arrangement
between
the
carrier
and
water
carrier
and
the
railroad.
it
leaves
open
the
invitation
to
the
railroads
to
establish
and
maintain
these
--
what
justice
fortas
referred
to
as
the
low
piggyback
rates.
now,
they
are
low,
they
are
lower
than
the
rest.
but
if
--
if
--
if
the
railroads
are
faced
with
the
situation
and
we're
the
ones
that
use
those
rates,
if
the
railroads
are
faced
with
the
situation
where
they're
told
that
if
you
put
in
a
low
piggyback
rate,
that
what
you're
going
to
do
is
through
that
process,
you're
going
to
just
make
it
possible
for
your
competitors,
the
motor
carriers
to
come
in
and
put
this
traffic
on
and
add
these
other
disadvantages,
then
we
are
going
to
suffer
as
users
of
those
tariff
rates
because
either
the
rates
are
going
to
go
up
or
the
entire
tariff
piggyback
basis
is
going
to
be
cancelled
or
in
the
parts
of
the
country
where
piggyback
does
not
exist
and
it
does
not
exist
all
over
the
country,
in
the
parts
of
the
country
where
the
piggyback
tariffs
have
not
yet
put
in
by
railroads,
those
railroads
would
just
simply,
i'm
afraid,
sit
back
and
be
deterred
from
putting
in
the
piggyback
service
that
would
be
helpful
to
us
and
to
our
patrons.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
pardon?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
from
my
viewpoint,
i
think
it
is
certainly
not
the
public
mr.
justice
black
because
the
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
think
it
has
to
be
the
motor
carriers
--
the
motor
carriers
and
the
water
carriers
on
a
basis
of
the
fact
that
it's
reflected
in
one
of
the
comments
made
by
vice
chairman
webb
who
dissented
from
the
commission's
report.
he
said
that
what
this
would
do
would
be
a
matter
of
capturing
by
the
motor
carrier
in
this
industry
which
is
a
huge
industry,
capturing
the
traffic
which
is
--
on
which
the
freight
forwarders
now
handle
and
they
--
that
traffic
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
the
motor
carrier
traffic
but
it
will
be
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no
more
--
no
sir.
no
more
in
that
respect
than
what
we
are
doing
ourselves.
that
is
the
freight
forwarders
hold
out
and
the
railroads
hold
out
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
on
these
tariffs.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
we
as
forwarders
are
not
putting
our
traffic
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
to
the
--
to
the
--
yes.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
to
the
extent
that
they
have
a
traffic
that
is
now
moving
over
the
highways
and
that
they
would
put
on
the
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
on
the
railroads,
it
would.
that
--
but
the
proposal
from
making
these
through
routes
arrangements
on
a
compulsory
basis
is
one
which
is
up
before
congress
at
present
by
the
commission.
the
commission
has
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
vested
authority.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
it
might
be
in
congress
--
and
matter
of
fact,
that's
one
of
the
basis
of
the
reason
that
being
urged
on
congress
and
it
has
been
urged
on
congress
for
at
least
three
out
of
the
last
five
years
to
change
the
law
in
that
respect
and
congress
has
declined
to
do
it
every
year
because
congress
has
watched
out
for
these
deep
ceded
relationships
among
the
different
forms
of
carriage,
different
forms
of
transportation
agencies.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
that's
right,
your
honor.
their
activities
in
the
sense
of
--
all
they
can
do,
they
--
all
they
do
in
between
is
ship.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
not
to
go
out
but
your
own
--
if
i'm
a
forwarder,
i
can't
send
my
own
trucks
outside
the
terminal
area
to
get
it.
i
might
arrange
for
--
if
there's
somebody
50
miles
away
that
has
a
shipment
that
i
can
consolidate
in
new
york
city
and
the
shipment
would
be
the
one
that
would
come
down
from
connecticut
say,
i
can
have
a
motor
carrier,
pick
that
ship
up
and
bring
it
down
to
new
york
city
for
me
but
i
couldn't
send
my
own
truck
out
there.
i'm
not
authorized
to
do
that.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
we
can't.
and
the
motor
carriers
would
be
doing
just
precisely
what
we
--
we
--
what
we
do
if
these
rules
went
through.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
is
there
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
any
distinction
between
the
piggyback
and
the
car
loading,
boat
carload?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
mean
forwarder.
does
he
tender
to
you
a
full
car?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
you
wouldn't
know
what's
in
the
car
if
it's
the
car
load?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
isn't
that
a
--
is
he
a
shipper?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
represent
these
freight
forwarder
appellees
in
this
case.
my
clients
are
the
ones
who
are
entirely
recognized
as
having
a
right
to
ship
and
so
recognized
in
the
statute.
these
new
rules
provide
for
an
invasion
of
that
mode
of
operation
and
that's
the
primary
basis
of
the
concern
of
my
clients
here.
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
decision
below
was
that
the
rules
do
violate
one
of
its
parts
and
sections
of
part
iv
of
the
act
which
regulates
freight
forwarding
and
moreover,
they
violate
the
direct
intentions
of
congress
to
keep
motor
carriers
and
railroads
too,
and
water
carriers
out
of
the
freight
forwarding
business.
now,
i
do
want
to
explain
furthermore
to
what
the
forwarder
does.
a
question
came
up
just
a
moment
ago
about
that.
the
forwarder
company
operates
by
making
shipments
over
these
regulated
common
carriers.
this
operation
of
making
shipments
is
the
distinctive
characteristic
of
freight
forwarder
operation.
the
statute
permits
the
freight
forwarder
to
have
his
own
motor
vehicles
inside
and
operate
them
inside
a
terminal
area
such
as
new
york
city
or
washington
but
not
to
operate
any
of
the
line
or
haul
transportation
in
between
the
terminals.
what
the
forwarder
does
is
to
assemble
the
shipments
inside
one
of
the
terminal
areas
and
he
can
do
that
with
his
trucks
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
and
then
he
takes
them
and
forms
a
carload
shipment
out
of
those.
he
puts
these
small
shipments
together
and
he
consolidates
them
as
the
general
word,
and
he
makes
a
carload
shipment
and
then
he
tenders
that
shipment
to
a
common
carrier
and
it's
almost
always
a
railroad
for
the
distances.
he
tenders
that
to
a
common
carrier
under
the
common
carrier's
tariff
rates.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
yes,
carload
rates.
now
the
carload
rates
of
course
--
the
carload
rate
for
a
single
carload
is
less
than
the
total
amount
of
the
rates
for
each
of
these
individual
shipments
and
the
forwarder
pays
his
own
expenses
and
he
makes
his
profit
by
that
spread
between
the
rates.
his
own
rates,
the
forwarders'
own
rates
must
be
just
and
reasonable
to
the
shipper
of
the
small
goods.
they
are
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
they
must
be
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
railroad
can
do
and
by
--
and
the
motor
carrier,
your
honor,
and
the
water
carrier
can
all
do
the
same
job
in
this
respect.
each
of
them
can
operate
with
the
pick
up
and
delivery
service
in
the
terminal
area
and
they
do.
there
are
certain
limitations
in
different
places
but
that's
typical.
each
one
of
them
does
it.
but
when
the
railroad
collects
those
small
shipments
that
it
has,
it
takes
them
and
handles
them
in
its
own
rail
service.
when
the
motor
carrier
collects
them,
it's
authorized
to
handle
them
in
the
part
ii
type
of
service
and
when
the
water
carrier
collects
them,
it
takes
them
by
water
and
down
to
the
destination,
and
then
it
comes
to
delivery.
the
distinction
and
the
difference
between
the
freight
forwarder
mode
and
the
thing
that
congress
has
called
and
recognized
in
part
iv,
has
stated
in
part
iv,
to
be
what
it
calls
the
inherent
nature
of
freight
forwarding.
the
inherent
nature
of
freight
forwarding
is
not
this
matter
of
the
collection
of
the
shipments
at
each
hand
because
all
carriers
do
that.
the
distinctive
nature
of
freight
forwarding
and
within
the
essence
of
the
trouble
that
these
rules
get
into
is
that
the
nature
of
freight
forwarding
is
to
take
those
shipments
that
it
collects,
combine
them
and
then
ship
them
on
an
operating
carrier,
but
we
are
not
an
operating
carrier.
we
ship
over
an
operating
carrier
and
freight
forwarders
are
the
only
mode
of
operation
of
a
transportation
agency
of
which
there
is
a
statutory
provision
for
that
method
of
operation.
that
statute
is
in
part
iv,
provides
that
freight
forwarders
may
utilize
the
services
of
a
railroad
or
of
a
motor
carrier
or
a
water
carrier
“for
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
transportation
of
such
shipments”,
and
that
is
not
in
anyone
of
the
rest
of
the
sections.
and
moreover,
it's
entirely
clear
if
we
looked
to
the
congressional
history
of
what
congress
intended
that
congress
expressly
when
it
enacted
part
iv,
expressly
decided
and
deliberately
stated
that
it
did
not
want
these
carriers
by
railroad
or
carriers
by
motor
carrier
or
carriers
by
water
carrier
to
be
engaging
in
freight
forwarding
which
is
the
matter
of
the
shipping
between
the
terminals.
i
see
it's
12,
so
i
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
see.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
mentioning
before
the
recess
that
congress
had
deliberately
examined
and
made
its
own
conclusion
as
to
whether
these
other
carriers
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
the
freight
forwarding
mode.
the
freight
forwarder
act
was
adopted
in
1942
and
in
the
legislative
history
preceding
that,
the
principal
report
which
was
reflected
in
the
final
form
of
the
bill
was
a
report
made
by
the
house
of
representatives
committee.
that
deliberate
--
that
committee
deliberately
took
up
this
question
about
the
relationship
of
the
freight
forwarder
mode
with
the
other
carriers.
and
the
committee
started
off
its
report
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
or
saying
that
forwarders
perform
a
unique
type
of
transportation
service.
and
then
on
the
first
page
also,
it
mentioned
that
forwarders,
they
utilize
the
services
of
rail,
motor
and
water
carriers
and
ship
by
whatever
means
is
the
best
way
to
do
the
shipping
and
that's
what
makes
their
form
of
operation
unique.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
yes,
mr.
justice.
as
freight
forwarders,
this
affects
us
in
--
in
--
in
one
or
two
or
three
different
kinds
of
very
sharp
ways.
one
is
it
permits
the
motor
carriers
and
the
water
carrier
but
particularly
the
motor
carriers
they
are
our
primary
competitors.
it
permits
them
to
offer
the
shippers
throughout
the
country
the
type
of
operation
that
the
freight
forwarders
have
been
operating
under
the
method
of
shipping
by
rail.
the
rules
themselves
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
it
does
exactly
that,
your
honor.
it
makes
them
--
every
one
of
these
water
carriers,
it
makes
them
a
freight
forwarder.
they
can
choose
under
the
rules
as
the
commission
sets
them
up,
it
gives
the
motor
carriers
who
up
to
now
have
been
operating
--
required
to
operate
under
the
act
and
intended
by
congress
to
operate
as
motor
carriers
in
the
ways
the
part
ii
describes
or
water
carriers
in
this
similar
kind
of
way.
it
gives
each
one
of
them
the
option
to
add
on
to
that
another
mode
of
operation
which
is
the
freight
forwarder
mode.
in
other
words
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
exactly.
now,
all
of
them
can
gather
and
all
of
them
do
and
all
of
them
have
historically
gathered
these
small
shipments
but
then
comes
the
way
in
which
they
get
it
from
this
concentration
point
over
to
the
destination
concentration
point
and
that's
what
we
have
the
distinction
in
the
different
modes
of
operation.
the
forwarders
do
what
their
name
implies
really.
they
forward
the
shipment
by
shipping
it
over
other
carriers.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
but
that
has
not
been
the
method
of
operation
of
the
other
carriers,
motor
carriers
or
railroads.
they
do
not
ship
and
they
are
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
forwarders
and
to
act
as
forwarders
and
to
--
and
to
ship.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
the
congress,
in
drawing
up
the
act,
came
to
that
expressed
conclusion.
the
word
it
expressed
in
the
committee
report
was
that
it
came
to
a
conclusion
that
there
should
be
a
policy
and
i'm
quoting,
“of
not
permitting”
this
is
in
quotes,
“of
not
permitting
them
--”
that
is
the
railroads
and
the
motor
carriers
and
the
freight
--
and
the
water
carriers
“--
to
engage
directly
in
the
freight
forwarding
business.”
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
and
the
reason
why
they
--
so
they
came
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
freight
--
there
is
a
difference
in
freight
rates,
your
honor,
yes.
what
the
--
the
--
both
of
those
are
services
held
up
by
the
railroads.
they
hold
up
the
boxcar
service
and
the
forwarders
use
the
boxcar
for
the
service
for
much
of
the
service.
they
have
in
the
past,
historically,
as
a
railroad
puts
in
piggyback
service
and
holds
that
out,
the
forwarders
are
able
to
use
that
lower
rate
basis
to
what
applies
to
the
piggyback
service.
they
either
--
the
forwarder
either
puts
the
goods
in
the
boxcar
or
consigns
that
to
the
destination
where
it
puts
the
goods
in
trailers.
it
takes
you
--
they
took
trailers
to
make
up
the
carload
shipment
and
consigns
that
to
the
destination.
so
that
the
forwarder
will
do
is
use
both
boxcar
service
and
the
tofc
service.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
typically,
yes.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
yes
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
that's
considered
to
be
a
carload
lot.
and
that
is
the
tendering
and
the
rate
typically
applies.
there
are
some
exceptions,
but
the
typical
basis
is
the
tendering
of
two
trailers
on
a
single
carload
and
then
of
course
ties
in
with
the
economy
a
little
bit
but
there
is
room
for
them
on
the
typical
flatcar.
and
on
the
typical
basis,
the
two
trailers
or
two
containers
without
wheels
constitute
the
one
carload
lot.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
am
against
mr.
ginnane
in
this
because
mr.
ginnane
argues
as
i
do
that
this
thing,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
emphasized
that
these
rules
would
make
shippers
and
forwarders
--
he
didn't
say
forwarders,
but
he
said
these
rules
would
make
shippers
out
of
the
motor
carriers
that
they
would
be
acting
as
shippers,
your
honor.
the
other
day,
last
thursday,
he
emphasized
that
strongly.
they'd
be
acting
as
shippers
or
patrons
of
the
railroads
and
that's
the
way
they
would
operate
if
these
rules
went
into
effect
but
when
they
become
shippers
and
this
is
where
i'd
part
company
with
mr.
ginnane,
when
they
act
as
shippers,
they
are
no
longer
acting
in
the
way
in
which
they
are
authorized
by
the
congress
to
act
in
the
mode
of
operation
for
motor
carriers.
when
they
become
shippers
your
honor,
they
are
then
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
exactly
and
that's
what
congress
intended.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
ship.
they
are
allowed
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
your
honor,
they
--
as
a
--
it
is
in
a
matter
of
discrimination,
i
think
on
that
and
the
discrimination
runs
in
a
different
kind
of
direction.
it
is
a
wholly
different
form
that
congress
for
example
prohibited.
there
is
a
section
in
the
freight
forwarding
act
that
actually
prohibits
these
people
from
becoming
--
from
being
--
pardon.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
motor
carriers
and
the
railroads
and
water
carriers
from
being
permitted
by
the
commission
to
operate
or
to
have
--
to
have
as
freight
forwarders.
the
commission
made
no
reference
to
that
in
its
report.
it's
a
result
of
this
policy,
that
provision
of
section
410
(c)
and
that's
at
the
back
of
our
brief
--
is
in
the
act
that
forbids
the
granting
of
any
freight
forwarding
permit
to
these
water
carriers
and
railroads
and
those
are
the
only
persons
that
congress
has
forbidden
the
commission
to
grant
a
freight
forwarding
permit
to.
and
yet,
as
mr.
ginnane
said,
operating
under
these
rules,
these
people
that
is
the
motor
carriers,
the
water
carriers,
and
the
railroad
--
they're
talking
again
the
rules
about
motor
carriers
and
water
carriers,
would
be
acting
as
shippers
and
as
patrons,
it
would
be
allowed
to
by
the
commission
and
permitted
to
by
the
commission.
and
when
they
are
allowed
to
do
that
by
he
commission
and
permitted
to
do
it,
they
were
then
being
permitted
by
the
commission
to
do
exactly
what
congress
have
said
the
commission
shall
not
grant
them
with
the
authority
to
do
it
and
that
is
to
make
their
operations
in
the
freight
forwarding
way.
they
carry
on
freight
forwarding.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
we
do
not
go
along
with
the
--
with
the
--
or
the
truckers.
the
truckers
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no.
the
only
way
we
go
along
with
the
truckers
is
that
i
think
the
truckers
also
go
along
with
mr.
ginnane
in
saying
that
--
that
these
rules
would
make
shippers
out
of
the
motor
carriers
and
they
said,
that's
alright
with
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
most
of
the
way,
your
honor,
but
not
entirely
all
because
to
us,
we
read
the
commission's
report
and
the
provisions
here
as
providing
for
a
right
of
shipping
and
not
a
matter
--
making
a
matter
of
a
through
route.
that
gives
these
rules
would
give
the
right
to
ship.
the
commission
treated
them
that
way
in
its
report
and
by
giving
them
the
right
to
ship
that
puts
it
over
in
the
situation
where
it
--
the
territory,
the
congress
forbad
to
them,
the
freight
forwarder
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would.
and
for
this
reason,
if
these
rules
go
into
effect
like
this
as
they
are
intended
to
be
and
the
area
of
shipping
on
the
tariff
rates
is
then
thrown
open
to
the
motor
carriers
who
are
very
strong
competitors
of
the
railroads
as
well
as
of
the
--
of
the
freight
forwarders,
the
impact
on
us
is
up
to
be
either
in
whole
or
in
part
exactly
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
mr.
ginnane
in
his
brief
has
referred
to.
he
has
said
that
the
railroads
could
comply
with
these
rules
by
cancelling
the
tariff
rates
or
piggyback
shipping
and
that
would
be
a
full
compliance
with
these
rules
and
if
--
if
that
happened,
our
people,
our
freight
forwarders
would
be
entirely
out
of
piggybacking
because
we
cannot
do
anything
except
ship
on
tariff
rates,
and
yet
the
motor
carriers
can
make
these
joint
rates
under
section
216
(c),
they
can
--
they
can
make
joint
rates
and
joint
through
route
arrangements
with
the
railroads
and
the
motor
carriers
would
then
be
competing
by
providing
piggyback
service
for
their
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
and
we
would
--
we
would
be
cut
out.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
it
has
a
very
serious
impact
on
us
because
it
would
be
--
it
has
less
impact
on
us
your
honor.
it
also
has
the
similar
impact
on
the
private
shipper
who
ships
his
own
goods
over
the
railroad.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
the
joint
rate
arrangement
is
permissible.
the
only
way
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
oh!
yes,
yes
in
any
way
--
indeed,
yes
--
we're
--
they're
competing
with
us
and
the
motor
carrier
has
the
--
has
a
right
now
and
if
he
does
compete
very,
very
successful,
he
is
big
and
where
our
freight
forwarders
are
small.
he
gets
the
traffic
because
he
has
the
authority
to
carry
the
traffic
over
the
road
in
his
own
trucks
or
to
make
these
joint
arrangements
with
the
railroads
under
section
216
(c).
he
can
make
either
one
of
them.
but
what
he
does
not
have
now
and
the
only
thing
that
we
have,
the
forwarders
have
is
the
right
to
ship
as
a
shipper
over
the
railroad,
not
if
you
--
if
you
were
to
add,
if
the
commission
adds
as
it
proposes
to
do,
to
add
the
one
advantage,
the
only
way
of
operation
that
the
freight
forwarder
is
allowed
to
operate,
add
that
on
to
what
the
motor
carrier
already
has,
you
make
a
tremendous
multi
service
group
out
of
the
motor
carriers
and
exactly
contrary
to
what
congress
itself
had
said
it
did
not
intend
to
do.
it
did
not
have
the
policy,
establish
the
policy
of
not
permitting
these
other
carriers
to
get
into
the
freight
forwarding
field,
and
then
wrote
into
the
act
the
provision
which
forbids
the
commission
from
granting
a
freight
forwarding
permit
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
to
any
of
the
carriers.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
moving
under
--
that
traffic
is
moving
under
a
joint
through
rate
arrangement,
they
are
not
acting
as
--
as
freight
forwarders.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
but
right
now
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
right
now,
as
always,
the
motor
carrier
can
collect
shipments
in
new
york,
put
them
in
his
own
trucks
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
and
pick
them
on
the
road.
no
your
honor,
the
impact
is
quite
different
because
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
it
cuts
into
our
business
but
it
leaves
open
to
us
as
long
as
it's
a
matter
of
the
--
of
a
through
rate
arrangement
between
the
carrier
and
water
carrier
and
the
railroad.
it
leaves
open
the
invitation
to
the
railroads
to
establish
and
maintain
these
--
what
justice
fortas
referred
to
as
the
low
piggyback
rates.
now,
they
are
low,
they
are
lower
than
the
rest.
but
if
--
if
--
if
the
railroads
are
faced
with
the
situation
and
we're
the
ones
that
use
those
rates,
if
the
railroads
are
faced
with
the
situation
where
they're
told
that
if
you
put
in
a
low
piggyback
rate,
that
what
you're
going
to
do
is
through
that
process,
you're
going
to
just
make
it
possible
for
your
competitors,
the
motor
carriers
to
come
in
and
put
this
traffic
on
and
add
these
other
disadvantages,
then
we
are
going
to
suffer
as
users
of
those
tariff
rates
because
either
the
rates
are
going
to
go
up
or
the
entire
tariff
piggyback
basis
is
going
to
be
cancelled
or
in
the
parts
of
the
country
where
piggyback
does
not
exist
and
it
does
not
exist
all
over
the
country,
in
the
parts
of
the
country
where
the
piggyback
tariffs
have
not
yet
put
in
by
railroads,
those
railroads
would
just
simply,
i'm
afraid,
sit
back
and
be
deterred
from
putting
in
the
piggyback
service
that
would
be
helpful
to
us
and
to
our
patrons.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
pardon?
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
from
my
viewpoint,
i
think
it
is
certainly
not
the
public
mr.
justice
black
because
the
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
think
it
has
to
be
the
motor
carriers
--
the
motor
carriers
and
the
water
carriers
on
a
basis
of
the
fact
that
it's
reflected
in
one
of
the
comments
made
by
vice
chairman
webb
who
dissented
from
the
commission's
report.
he
said
that
what
this
would
do
would
be
a
matter
of
capturing
by
the
motor
carrier
in
this
industry
which
is
a
huge
industry,
capturing
the
traffic
which
is
--
on
which
the
freight
forwarders
now
handle
and
they
--
that
traffic
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
the
motor
carrier
traffic
but
it
will
be
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no
more
--
no
sir.
no
more
in
that
respect
than
what
we
are
doing
ourselves.
that
is
the
freight
forwarders
hold
out
and
the
railroads
hold
out
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
on
these
tariffs.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
we
as
forwarders
are
not
putting
our
traffic
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
to
the
--
to
the
--
yes.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
to
the
extent
that
they
have
a
traffic
that
is
now
moving
over
the
highways
and
that
they
would
put
on
the
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
on
the
railroads,
it
would.
that
--
but
the
proposal
from
making
these
through
routes
arrangements
on
a
compulsory
basis
is
one
which
is
up
before
congress
at
present
by
the
commission.
the
commission
has
--
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
--
vested
authority.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
it
might
be
in
congress
--
and
matter
of
fact,
that's
one
of
the
basis
of
the
reason
that
being
urged
on
congress
and
it
has
been
urged
on
congress
for
at
least
three
out
of
the
last
five
years
to
change
the
law
in
that
respect
and
congress
has
declined
to
do
it
every
year
because
congress
has
watched
out
for
these
deep
ceded
relationships
among
the
different
forms
of
carriage,
different
forms
of
transportation
agencies.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
that's
right,
your
honor.
their
activities
in
the
sense
of
--
all
they
can
do,
they
--
all
they
do
in
between
is
ship.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
well,
not
to
go
out
but
your
own
--
if
i'm
a
forwarder,
i
can't
send
my
own
trucks
outside
the
terminal
area
to
get
it.
i
might
arrange
for
--
if
there's
somebody
50
miles
away
that
has
a
shipment
that
i
can
consolidate
in
new
york
city
and
the
shipment
would
be
the
one
that
would
come
down
from
connecticut
say,
i
can
have
a
motor
carrier,
pick
that
ship
up
and
bring
it
down
to
new
york
city
for
me
but
i
couldn't
send
my
own
truck
out
there.
i'm
not
authorized
to
do
that.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
no.
mr.
d.
robert
thomas
we
can't.
and
the
motor
carriers
would
be
doing
just
precisely
what
we
--
we
--
what
we
do
if
these
rules
went
through.
