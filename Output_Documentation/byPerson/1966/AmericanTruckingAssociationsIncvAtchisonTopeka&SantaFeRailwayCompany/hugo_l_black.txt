your
brief
was
the
blue
one?
justice

oh!
the
red
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
blue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
to
explain
to
me
exactly
what
that
means,
the
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
we
not
have
a
case
some
years
ago
under
the
fela
that
touched
on
that
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
we
had
one
where
we
have
what
they
call
the
sea-going
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
on
a
ferry
as
i
recall
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it
might
have
something
bearing
on
that
definition
whatever
effect
it
might
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
case,
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
--
i'm
sorry.
a
competitive
carrier
has
no
right
to
ask
his
competitor
to
carry
his
goods
and
cannot
be
forced
to
do
so
except
under
the
through
routing
sections
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
said,
a
motor
carrier.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
meant
that
the
one
carrier
cannot
tender
to
another
carrier
a
good
which
he
has
been
carrying
and
won't
carry
it
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
carry
except
under
the
proviso
for
through
routes
and
that's
voluntary
and
they
didn't
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
they
require
you
to
move?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
they
require
the
railroads
to
move?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
truckers
bring
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
freight
that's
delivered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
his
--
in
his
car?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
his
trailer
car?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
deliver
it
to
you,
they
deliver
--
they
deliver
automobiles
or
do
they
deliver
automobiles
inside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
it
--
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
deliver
those
various
articles
of
freight
or
do
they
deliver
them
in
a
car?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
cost
the
railroad
anymore
to
handle
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
if
it
was
delivered
by
a
shipper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
carload?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
in
verse
succinctly
how
this
order
affects
you
as
a
freight
forwarder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
properly
gives
them
advantage
of
being
forwarders
when
they're
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
go
out
and
gather
it
up,
collect
it
together
and
then
ship
them
in
cargo
lines?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
extent,
if
any,
does
your
position
carry
you
along
with
or
against
mr.
ginnane?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
then
you
say
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
otherwise
it
would
be
discriminating
against
as
we've
observed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
extent
if
any
do
you
go
along
with
the
truckers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
any
way
whatever?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
extent,
if
any,
do
you
go
far
with
the
railroads?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up
but
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
i
could
just
ask
you
this
one
short
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
your
view
point,
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the

justice

who
is?
justice

wouldn't
it
keep

wouldn't
it

off

justice

black
well,
what
i'm
talking
--
justice

about

that

that
it
will
go

that

justice

may
i
ask
what
is
the
difference
in
