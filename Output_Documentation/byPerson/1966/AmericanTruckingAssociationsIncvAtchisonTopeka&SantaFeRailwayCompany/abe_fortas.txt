justice
abe
fortas
can
the
railroads
obtain
from
the
truckers
a
correlative
service?
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
they
could
--
is
there
anyway
about
which
railroads
can
engage
the
truckers
to
take
freight
from
railhead
to
shipper
or
railhead
to
destination?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
through
what?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
that
isn't
quite
my
question
which
i've
made
clear.
if
a
railroad
wants
a
trucking
company
to
take
on
the
burden
or
the
duty
of
transporting
goods
from
the
railhead
to
the
destination
or
to
pick
the
goods
up
at
the
door
of
the
shipper
and
deliver
it
to
the
railhead,
can
the
railroad
get
that
service
at
the
same
rate
as
any
other
shipper?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
the
--
your
understanding
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
trucker
would
have
to
carry
the
freight
for
the
railroads
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
the
same
term
the
trucker
have
to
carry
up
anybody
else
and
--
and
that's
the
principal
point
which
you're
contending
here
on
behalf
of
the
truckers
with
respect
to
railroads.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
trucking
company
wants
to
use
a
ferry?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
wouldn't
supersede
the
statute
and
your
argument
was
a
statutory
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
miller,
i
don't
think
--
perhaps
i'm
wrong
but
i
don't
think
that
was
quite
purported,
that
you
and
i
were
exploring.
as
i
understand
and
as
i
understood
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
it
was
to
the
effect
that
trucks
by
definition
are
restricted
to
the
public
road
system.
justice
abe
fortas
and
therefore,
they
should
--
that
indicates
a
congressional
intent,
i
suppose,
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
be
a
feedback
passenger
on
the
railroads
and
i
asked
you
what
that
--
to
rephrase
that
argument
in
light
of
the
fact
that
trucks
are
carried
on
ferries.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
can
do
that
only
with
the
consent
of
the
railroad,
isn't
that
right
mr.
shea?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
happens
if
the
railroad
doesn't
want
to
enter
into
a
joint
through
rate
arrangement?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that's
right.
now,
may
i
note
not
merely
on
a
matter
of
rate
but
a
matter
of
service,
the
result
is
also
that
no
principle
of
equality
governed.
so
far
as
service
is
concerned,
the
shipper
can
operate
at
any
service
point
but
not
the
motor
carrier,
under
these
rules,
he
must
offer
at
a
joint
service
point.
the
shipper
or
the
freight
forwarder
may
say,
“you
must
take
it
by
the
most
direct
route”,
but
not
the
motor
carrier,
he
can't
use
it
unless
it's
at
least
85%
as
roundabout
as
his
highway
route.
the
shipper
or
the
motor
--
or
the
freight
forwarder
can
say,
“take
it
to
the
service
point
nearest
destination”,
but
not
the
motor
carrier.
the
motor
carrier
has
to
say,
“take
it
to
a
joint
service
point”.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
there
is
any
principle
of
equality
could
be
derived
from
2
and
3,
these
rules
do
not
carry
out
any
such
principle
either
as
to
rates
or
as
to
service
as
between
the
motor
carrier
and
the
shipper
or
the
freight
forwarder
and
i
suggest
that
that
kind
of
a
principle
of
--
either
of
the
principle
must
be
wrong
or
the
results
are
wrong
and
i
think
both
now.
i
take
it
that
that
he
know
this
agreement,
i
should
hope
between
mr.
ginnane
and
myself
that
the
commission
must
find
some
substantive
authority
in
this
act
to
justify
these
rules
and
if
it
justifies
these
rules
on
any
grounds,
it's
under
section
2.
that
is
the
only
section
to
which
reference
is
made.
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
if
it
will
to
read
with
me
the
provisions
of
section
2
which
we
find
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
this
is
the
yellow
brief,
and
i
will
admit
words
not
critical.
if
any
common
carrier
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
part
shall
charge
any
person
a
greater
or
a
less
compensation
for
any
service
in
the
transportation
of
property
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
part,
than
it
charges
for
doing
--
than
it
charges
any
other
person
for
doing
for
him
or
them
a
like
and
contemporaneous
service
in
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions,
such
common
carrier
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
unjust
discrimination
which
is
prohibited
and
declared
to
be
unlawful.
now,
this
is
language
which
says
that
it
shall
be
an
unjust
discrimination
to
charge
for
a
like
service
a
different
rate.
but
how
does
the
commission
read
it.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
38,
right
at
the
top,
we
quoted
what
the
commission
said.
the
commission
says,
“section
2
requires
rail
carriers
to
make
like
and
contemporaneous
service
in
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
divisions
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
no
less
than
received
from
any
other
person”
and
if
you'd
look
to
page
8
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
next
to
the
last
page.
they
just
adopt
that
language
which
they
say
section
2
provides
as
their
rule
2.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
it
that
what
section
2
and
this
is
the
only
provision
of
the
act
on
which
the
commission
rely.
what
section
2
said
is
that
you
may
not
charge
a
different
rate
and
what
the
commission
is
saying
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
mr.
shea
that
there's
nothing
in
this
act
that
requires
a
rail
carrier
to
furnish
the
same
service
to
everybody?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
shea,
may
i
ask
you
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
you're
reading
the
proviso
of
section
3
cuts
very
deeply
and
that
would
indicate
that
railroads
can
disregard
section
3
in
any
case
where
it's
to
their
advantage
to
do
so
at
least
with
respect
to
any
matter
involving
truckers
or
water
carriers.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
well,
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
pretty
much
what
i
thought
you
are
saying
that
is
to
say
that
where
the
tariff
concern
is
that
of
a
trucker
or
a
water
carrier
i
suppose
that
the
--
you
read
the
proviso,
its
meaning
that
any
discrimination
by
the
railroad
goes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
here
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
here
you
have
though
a
refusal
to
--
i
suppose
refusal
to
accept
--
to
provide
a
service
to
truckers,
namely
the
service
of
carrying
the
trucks
on
freight
cars
and
i
assume
that
is
the
section
3
type
of
discrimination
and
that
your
position
is
that
it's
a
section
3
type
of
discrimination
unless
it's
excused
by
the
proviso.
justice
abe
fortas
how
big
is
a
terminal
area?
is
that
the
whole
city?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
well,
now
suppose
a
railroad
provides
door-to-door
service
within
its
own
terminal
areas,
that
is
to
say
to
the
railhead
by
rail
and
then
trucks
to
the
extremity
of
its
terminal
service,
would
you
consider
that
a
holding
out
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
to
service
a
trucker
to
order
the
pick
up
of
the
same
types
of
merchandise
at
the
railhead
for
delivery
within
the
terminal
area?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
suppose
a
railroad
used
a
piggyback
which
i
understand
is
done,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say
railroad
takes
its
own
trucks
and
trailers
and
carries
them
on
--
on
the
rails
to
the
railhead
and
then
they
--
they
trundle
off
and
they
go
to
the
--
somewhere
outside
of
the
railhead
area
but
within
the
terminal
area.
now,
when
the
railroad
--
on
your
theory,
would
the
railroad
be
required
to
carry
piggyback,
a
trucker,
within
that
same
area?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
not?
i
mean,
here's
the
other
railroad
that's
providing
exactly
that
service.
the
railroad
holds
itself
out
to
do
a
piggyback
trailer
service
from
point
a
to
the
--
a
point
within
its
terminal
area
beyond
the
railhead.
now,
a
trucker
comes
along
and
he
says,
“please
piggyback
for
me
at
exactly
the
same
place.”
now
why
is
it
--
the
holding
out
principle
plus
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white
about
holding
on
subsidiaries?
justice
abe
fortas
doesn't
it
follow
from
putting
on
these
two
things
together?
justice
abe
fortas
refer
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
yes,
is
this
a
modification
of
the
holding
out
theory
that
you
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
advancing?
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
to
--
but
not
to
a
trucker.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
the
issue
here
is
who
has
a
legitimate
right
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
use
it
service
within
the
areas.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
afraid
that's
--
i
was
afraid
that's
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
a
holding
out
applies
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
truckers.
justice
abe
fortas
could
the
railroad
itself
do
that
same
job
within
the
terminal
area
accumulated
cargo?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
there
a
substantial
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
there
a
substantial
difference
in
freight
rates
between
carload
lots
and
freight
rate
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
piggyback
service?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
the
rate
applicable
to
the
trailers
work
in
piggyback?
that
is
to
say
that
--
you
say
it
takes
two
trailers
to
constitute
a
carload,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
a
single
trucking
company
should
put
two
trailers
on
a
flatcar,
would
it
get
a
carload
lot?
justice
abe
fortas
right?
justice
abe
fortas
can
the
railroads
obtain
from
the
truckers
a
correlative
service?
justice
abe
fortas
can
the
railroads
obtain
from
the
truckers
a
correlative
service?
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
they
could
--
is
there
anyway
about
which
railroads
can
engage
the
truckers
to
take
freight
from
railhead
to
shipper
or
railhead
to
destination?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
through
what?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
that
isn't
quite
my
question
which
i've
made
clear.
if
a
railroad
wants
a
trucking
company
to
take
on
the
burden
or
the
duty
of
transporting
goods
from
the
railhead
to
the
destination
or
to
pick
the
goods
up
at
the
door
of
the
shipper
and
deliver
it
to
the
railhead,
can
the
railroad
get
that
service
at
the
same
rate
as
any
other
shipper?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
the
--
your
understanding
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
trucker
would
have
to
carry
the
freight
for
the
railroads
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
the
same
term
the
trucker
have
to
carry
up
anybody
else
and
--
and
that's
the
principal
point
which
you're
contending
here
on
behalf
of
the
truckers
with
respect
to
railroads.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
trucking
company
wants
to
use
a
ferry?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
wouldn't
supersede
the
statute
and
your
argument
was
a
statutory

justice
abe

mr.

i

you
what
that
--
to
rephrase
that
argument
in
light
of
the
fact
that
trucks
are
carried
on
ferries.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
can
do
that
only
with
the
consent
of
the
railroad,
isn't
that
right
mr.
shea?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
happens
if
the
railroad
doesn't
want
to
enter
into
a
joint
through
rate
arrangement?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that's

or

nearest

but
not
the
motor

the
motor
carrier
has
to
say,
“take
it
to
a
joint
service
point”.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
there
is
any
principle
of
equality
could
be
derived
from
2
and
3,
these
rules
do
not
carry
out
any
such
principle
either
as
to
rates
or
as
to
service
as
between
the
motor
carrier
and
the
shipper
or
the
freight
forwarder
and
i
suggest
that
that
kind
of
a
principle
of
--
either
of
the
principle
must
be
wrong
or
the
results
are
wrong
and
i
think
both
now.
i
take
it
that
that

that
is
the
only
section
to
which

is
made.
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
if
it
will

read
with
me
the
provisions
of

and
if

they

2
provides
as
their
rule
2.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
it
that
what
section
2
and
this
is
the
only
provision
of
the
act
on
which
the
commission
rely.
what
section
2
said
is
that
you
may
not
charge
a
different
rate
and
what
the
commission
is
saying
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
mr.
shea
that
there's
nothing
in
this
act
that
requires
a
rail
carrier
to
furnish
the
same
service
to
everybody?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
shea,
may
i
ask
you
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
you're
reading
the
proviso
of
section
3
cuts
very
deeply
and
that
would
indicate
that
railroads
can
disregard
section
3
in
any
case
where
it's
to
their
advantage
to
do
so
at
least
with
respect
to
any
matter
involving
truckers
or
water
carriers.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
well,
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
pretty
much
what
i
thought
you
are
saying
that
is
to
say
that
where
the
tariff
concern
is
that
of
a
trucker
or
a
water
carrier
i
suppose
that
the
--
you
read
the
proviso,
its
meaning
that
any
discrimination
by
the
railroad
goes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
here
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
here
you
have
though
a
refusal
to
--
i
suppose
refusal
to
accept
--
to
provide
a
service
to
truckers,
namely
the
service
of
carrying
the
trucks
on
freight
cars
and
i
assume
that
is
the
section
3
type
of
discrimination
and
that
your
position
is
that
it's
a
section
3
type
of
discrimination
unless
it's
excused
by
the
proviso.
justice
abe
fortas
how
big
is
a
terminal
area?
is
that
the
whole
city?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
well,
now
suppose
a
railroad
provides
door-to-door
service
within
its
own
terminal
areas,
that
is
to
say
to
the
railhead
by
rail
and
then
trucks
to
the
extremity
of
its
terminal
service,
would
you
consider
that
a
holding
out
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
to
service
a
trucker
to
order
the
pick
up
of
the
same
types
of
merchandise
at
the
railhead
for
delivery
within
the
terminal
area?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
suppose
a
railroad
used
a
piggyback
which
i
understand
is
done,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say
railroad
takes
its
own
trucks
and
trailers
and
carries
them
on
--
on
the
rails
to
the
railhead
and
then
they
--
they
trundle
off
and
they
go
to
the
--
somewhere
outside
of
the
railhead
area
but
within
the
terminal
area.
now,
when
the
railroad
--
on
your
theory,
would
the
railroad
be
required
to
carry
piggyback,
a
trucker,
within
that
same
area?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
not?
i
mean,
here's
the
other
railroad
that's
providing
exactly
that
service.
the
railroad
holds
itself
out
to
do
a
piggyback
trailer
service
from
point
a
to
the
--
a
point
within
its
terminal
area
beyond
the
railhead.
now,
a
trucker
comes
along
and
he
says,
“please
piggyback
for
me
at
exactly
the
same
place.”
now
why
is
it
--
the
holding
out
principle
plus
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white
about
holding
on
subsidiaries?
justice
abe
fortas
doesn't
it
follow
from
putting
on
these
two
things
together?
justice
abe
fortas
refer
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
yes,
is
this
a
modification
of
the
holding
out
theory
that
you
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
advancing?
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
to
--
but
not
to
a
trucker.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
the
issue
here
is
who
has
a
legitimate
right
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
use
it
service
within
the
areas.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
afraid
that's
--
i
was
afraid
that's
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
a
holding
out
applies
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
truckers.
justice
abe
fortas
could
the
railroad
itself
do
that
same
job
within
the
terminal
area
accumulated
cargo?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
there
a
substantial
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
there
a
substantial
difference
in
freight
rates
between
carload
lots
and
freight
rate
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
piggyback
service?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
the
rate
applicable
to
the
trailers
work
in
piggyback?
that
is
to
say
that
--
you
say
it
takes
two
trailers
to
constitute
a
carload,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
a
single
trucking
company
should
put
two
trailers
on
a
flatcar,
would
it
get
a
carload
lot?
justice
abe
fortas
right?
