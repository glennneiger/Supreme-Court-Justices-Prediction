mr.
sigmon,
are
you
speaking
next
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
had
--
you
have
finished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
miller?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
that
--
on
that
one,
i'm
just
wondering,
could
the
--
could
the
motor
carriers
charge
more
to
carry
let's
say
produce
that
has
been
carried
part
of
the
way
by
railroads
than
it
would
charge
any
other
person
--
any
other
person
who
is
shipping.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
that
isn't
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
saying,
suppose
the
railroad
of
the
trucks
were
in
the
business
of
carrying
some
farm
produce
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
the
farm
to
the
canners
and
the
railroad
carried
it
a
part
of
the
way
from
the
farm
to
the
railhead,
could
--
could
the
carriers,
could
the
motor
carrier
then
charge
the
shipper
more
for
carrying
it
from
the
railhead
to
the
cannery
then
it
would
anybody
else
who
might
want
the
goods
carried
over
the
same
route.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
motor
carriers
engaged
in
--
in
carrying
produce
from
the
farm
to
a
cannery.
now,
the
railroad
doesn't
go
as
far
as
the
cannery.it
goes
--
it
goes
halfway
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
suppose
it
carried
the
same
kind
of
produce
from
the
--
from
the
farm
to
its
railhead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
it
had
to
be
picked
up
there
by
the
motor
carrier
and
carried
to
--
carried
to
the
cannery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
the
--
could
the
motor
carrier
charge
more
for
carrying
it
from
the
railhead
to
the
--
to
the
cannery
than
if
it
was
merely
carrying
the
produce
of
some
farmer
that
it
picked
up
at
that
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
principle,
how
would
that
be
different
from
this
--
from
this
piggyback
situation
of
the
--
of
the
motor
carrier
who
carries
the
goods
for
some
distance,
puts
it
on
a
railroad,
carries
this
another
portion
at
a
distance
and
then
takes
it
off
and
carries
it
the
rest
of
the
way.
what
is
the
difference
there,
in
principle,
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
correct
sir.
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
a
formal
publication
of
a
joint
rate
nor
is
it
necessary
to
have
even
expressed
arrangements
for
a
through
route
to
be
established,
it
is
only
necessary
for
the
cooperating
carriers
to
receive
and
transmit
traffic
which
the
two
carriers
are
handling.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
--
any
provision
in
the
act
that
would
permit
the
railroads
to
refuse
to
carry
even
though
they
didn't
have
a
joint
--
a
through
rate?
is
there
anything
in
the
act
that
would
permit
the
railroad
to
refuse
to
carry
this
truck's
piggyback?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
necessarily
exclude
the
right
of
the
carrier
to
--
motor
carrier
to
have
his
trucks
carried
on
the
same
terms
as
anybody
else
without
a
through
rate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
the
railroads
then
operate
their
own
piggyback
system
and
have
their
own
trucking
on
either
end
of
the
trip?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
mr.
shea
that
would
take
us
to
the
point,
would
it
not,
where
the
railroads
could
say
to
the
motor
carriers,
“you
just
can't
--
you
just
can't
bring
your
trucks
piggyback
on
our
railroad.
we
won't
let
you”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
see
now.
mr.
duke.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
a
--
suppose
a
carrier
takes
--
a
motor
carrier
takes
produce
from
a
farm
to
a
rail
terminal
and
then
the
produce
goes
to
another
rail
terminal
and
there,
the
same
motor
carrier
takes
it
from
there
to
the
processing
plant.
is
that
a
through
rate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
--
not
because
i
asked
--
the
reason
i
ask
you
is
because
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
the
difference
between
that
and
what
we
have
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
let's
--
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
--
let's
take
something
other
than
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
something
other
than
produce.
i
didn't
mean
to
put
that
in
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
this
piggyback
service
originate?
who
originated
it?
who
thought
it
up
in
advanced
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thomas,
you
may
continue
your

chief

may
i
ask
if
the
activities
of
the
forwarder
are
confined
to
the
terminal
areas
on
--
on
both
ends
of
the
railroad?
chief

yes.
you
can't
go

to
get

to
gather
together
your

chief

you
can't
