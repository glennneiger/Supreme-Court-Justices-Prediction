mr.
paul
r.
duke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
question
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
compel
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
railroads
and
motor
carriers.
now,
that's
something
that
i
think
some
find
shocking.
i
know
i
did
when
i
first
discovered
it
because
i
thought
the
commission
could
compel
a
railroad
to
do
just
about
anything.
but
i
think
that
lies
at
the
root
of
this
case
because
i
think
what
the
commission
has
done
by
rules
2
and
3
is
try
to
overcome
this
lack
of
power
it
had
to
compel
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
supply
it
through
the
device
of
these
rules.
we
submit
that
rules
2
and
3
do
result
in
through
motor-rail
routes
and
therefore
in
--
are
invalid
as
beyond
the
authority
of
the
commission.
now
what
is
a
through
route?
i
think
very
basically
and
simply,
a
through
route
is
an
arrangement
either
expressed
or
implied
between
connecting
carriers
for
the
carriage,
for
the
continuous
carriage
of
goods
over
the
lines
of
such
carriers.
in
other
words,
there's
no
need
for
the
shipper
once
he's
tendered
it
to
the
originating
carrier
to
intervene
again,
he
gets
a
through
movement
almost
by
the
name,
a
continuous
movement
over
the
lines
of
two
or
more
carriers.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
physically
the
transportation
which
rules
2
and
3
would
produce,
meets
every
test
of
through
motor-rail
transportation.
the
motor
carrier
would
pick
it
up
from
the
shipper
under
his
tariff.
he
would
bring
it
to
the
railroad
terminal,
turn
it
over
to
the
railroad,
ask
them
to
move
it
to
their
ramp,
take
it
back
and
deliver
it
to
the
shipper.
now,
that
is
the
traditional
example
of
a
through
motor-rail-motor
movement.
now,
when
we
raised
this
contention
before
the
commission,
they
had
one
answer
to
it.
they
said
even
conceding
these
were
through
routes,
they
weren't
compulsory
and
they
said
that
because
the
motor
carrier
didn't
have
to
use
the
service,
well,
that's
right.
but
then
they
also
said
there
was
no
duty
on
the
railroads
to
publish
any
trailer-on-flatcar
tariffs.
in
other
words,
they
were
suggesting
that
we
could
completely
abandon
our
trailer-on-flatcar
business,
our
tremendous
investment
in
it,
if
we
didn't
want
the
motor
carriers
to
use
our
tariffs
and
therefore,
the
continued
maintenance
of
our
tariffs
and
what
i
suggest
are
these
through
motor-rail
routes
was
voluntary.
i
suggest
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
ridiculous
as
a
matter
of
common
sense.
i
suggest
that
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
because
once
we
have
all
this
equipment
and
facilities,
under
section
1
(4)
of
the
act,
a
shipper
upon
a
reasonable
request
can
require
us
to
produce
the
transportation
and
publish
charges
for
it.
i
would
suggest
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
it's
like
saying
that
the
man
who
gave
up
his
wallet
to
the
robber
on
the
threat
--
your
money
or
your
life
did
so
voluntarily
because
he
had
a
choice.
now
on
brief,
the
government
and
the
commission
and
the
motor
carriers
try
a
new
attack.
they
say,
these
aren't
through
routes
because
there's
no
holding
out
so
even
if
compulsory,
rules
2
and
3
don't
violate
the
statute.
and
for
this
effort,
they
cite
one
sentence
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
thompson
versus
united
states
which
did
say
that
the
test
of
a
through
route
is
a
holding
out
by
the
carriers.
but
of
course,
what
the
court
was
examining
in
thompson
was
a
voluntary
through
route.
the
commission
had
decided
not
to
use
its
compulsory
powers
in
thompson
but
had
found
the
existence
of
a
voluntary
through
route.
well,
of
course,
if
you're
looking
to
see
whether
a
voluntary
through
route
has
been
established,
it's
quite
appropriate
to
see
if
there's
been
a
holding
out
by
the
carriers.
i
would
also
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
holding
out
by
the
railroads
and
that's
our
real
objection,
our
real
complaint.
the
motor
carriers
hold
it
out
for
us.
they're
going
to
hold
out
without
our
consent,
without
our
prior
agreement,
a
motor-rail
motor
service.
now,
also
in
this
case
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
you
rate
--
you
pose
a
very
difficult
question,
mr.
chief
justice
because
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well,
you
see,
once
you
select
produce
mr.
chief
justice,
you've
happen
to
pick
a
commodity
that
the
motor
carriers
can
handle
without
regulation
under
the
agriculture
exemption.
we
are
regulated
in
the
handling
of
produce.
if
you
would
take
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
iron
and
steel
ball
bearings
or
something
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
alright.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
it
is
a
particularly
difficult
question
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
--
because
--
let's
take
steel
widgets.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i
would
suggest
that
a
railroad
has
no
more
right
to
ship
over
a
motor
carrier
than
a
motor
carrier
has
to
ship
over
a
railroad
and
i
say
that's
none.
i
would
say
that
if
a
railroad
wants
to
get
a
motor
carrier
to
handle
part
of
its
business,
let's
take
the
iron
steel
widgets
to
a
point
outside
the
terminal
area.
now,
we
can
handle
them
ourselves
inside
the
terminal
area
because
the
congress
specifically
gave
us
that
power.
but
outside
the
terminal
area,
we
have
to
find
a
motor
carrier
who
is
willing
to
enter
into
a
through
route
arrangement
with
us
just
like
if
he
wants
to
have
rail
service
as
a
part
of
his
through
movement,
he's
going
to
find
a
railroad
that's
willing
to
handle
it
with
him.
it
cuts
both
ways.
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
suggest
that
once
a
railroad
holds
out
or
agrees
to
join
in
a
through
route
with
motor
carriers,
it
couldn't
charge
its
subsidiary
a
dollar
and
any
other
motor
carrier
$2
because,
216
(c)
puts
on
railroads
the
duty
to
establish
nondiscriminatory,
non-prejudicial
divisions
among
those
motor
carriers
that
it
does
choose
to
join
with.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no.
i
don't
say
that
there's
an
absolute,
a
compulsion
to
enter
in
because
that
would
mean
that
once
you
entered
into
a
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you've
entered
--
entered
into
it
with
two
truck
lines,
you
can't
have
a
division
with
one
that's
a
dollar
and
a
division
with
another
one
that's
$2.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
because
the
commission
has
the
right
under
216
(c)
and
216
(f)
to
proscribe
the
divisions
of
joint
motor-rail
rates
and
the
parties
to
them
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
216
(c).
mr.
paul
r.
duke
it
says,
in
the
case
of
such
joint
rates,
meaning,
voluntary
motor-rail
rates
or
charges,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
carriers
parties
thereto
to
establish
just
and
reasonable
regulations
and
practices
in
connection
therewith
and
just
and
reasonable
and
equitable
divisions
thereof
as
between
the
carriers
participating
therein
which
shall
not
unduly
prefer
or
prejudice
any
of
such
participating
carriers.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
that
would
prevent
any
railroad
from
entering
into
divisions
--
different
division
arrangements
as
between
the
motor
carriers
with
whom
it
does
enter
into.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
it
refers
to
preference
and
prejudice
your
honor
which
normally
as
a
comparison
as
between
one
here
and
one
over
here.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
generally,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
it
might
go
beyond.
it's
--
it
--
the
commission
has
the
power
to
determine
upon
the
filing
by
railroad
of
its
tariff
what
a
reasonable
terminal
area
is.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
you
mean
he
wants
to
bring
it
to
us
as
the
shipper
and
ship
it
to
--
over
our
line?
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no.
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
a
holding
out
because
i
say
the
motor
carrier
has
no
right
to
ship
because
of
the
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no
sir.
not
unless
it
had
chosen
to
enter
into
a
joint
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no.
i
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
fortas
--
fortas
that
the
motor
carrier
has
no
right
to
ship
over
the
railroad,
but
if
the
railroad
chooses
to
enter
into
a
through
route
arrangement
within,
then
they
will
perform
that
service
pursuant
to
their
through
route
agreement.
i
suspect
what
is
troubling
the
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
--
we
hold
our
service
out
to
any
shipper
who
has
a
legitimate
right
to
use
it
but
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
but
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
but
that
a
motor
carrier
because
of
his
federally
regulated
status
as
a
carrier,
when
he
turns
traffic
over
to
a
railroad,
he
has
created
a
through
motor-rail
route.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that's
correct
because
the
trucker
has
no
right
to
ship.
i
would
suspect
that
the
real
--
we
think
we
have
the
best
of
the
statutory
and
the
technical
legal
arguments
but
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
what
is
most
troublesome
to
most
people
who
hear
about
this
is
“what's
the
matter
with
you
railroads,
why
don't
you
want
this
business?
why
don't
you
want
motor
carriers
to
come
to
you
and
turn
trailers
over
to
you
under
your
tariff?”
well,
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
many,
many
practical
reasons
why
railroads
want
to
have
the
right
to
agree
in
advance
to
enter
in
the
through
route
arrangements
where
they
can
negotiate
all
of
the
various
provisions
that
are
entailed
in
a
through
route
service.
first
of
all,
now
the
quite
simple
answer
and
that
is
the
railroads
are
quite
naturally
weary
of
their
motor
carrier
competitors
bearing
gifts
but
that's
no
real
practical
answer.
the
answer
it
seems
to
me
is
that
motor
carrier
has
no
obligation
to
turn
all
of
his
business
over
to
us
or
any
specific
portion
of
it.
therefore,
the
business
that
he
is
liable
to
turn
over
to
us
is
the
business
that
there
is
the
most
difficulty
in
handling.
now,
mr.
ginnane
suggested
that
the
motor
carriers
are
reasonable
men
and
they
would
make
arrangements
in
advance.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
advancement
of
the
railroads
piggyback
service
is
not
necessarily
the
principle
or
a
prime
aim
of
the
highway
carriers
in
this
country.
but
secondly,
there
is
the
practical
problem
that
much
freight
in
this
country
is
one-directional,
and
one
of
the
principle
cost
items
which
raises
transportation
prices
is
the
problem
of
empty
return
that
you
have
to
move
back
to
the
origin
locations
where
much
of
the
traffic
originates
empty
equipment.
well,
the
fact
is,
if
a
motor
carrier
can
ship
via
us,
he
can
turn
over
to
us
this
surplus
or
one-way
business
that
he
has
for
which
he
can't
set
up
a
balance
movement.
and
therefore,
we'll
have
to
confront
ourselves
not
only
with
our
own
empty
return
but
with
his
also.
this
would
tend
to
raise
railroad
costs
and
also
consequently
raise
railroad
prices,
all
to
the
benefit
of
our
competitor
who
would
be
continuing
to
publish
rates
for
an
all-highway
service.
i
will
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
the
railroads
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
the
first
evidence
of
it
was
actually
boat-on-flatcar
service.
it
began
back
in
1843
where
a
railroad
was
moving
canal
boats
on
flatcars.
it
kind
of
died
out
in
the
late
50s
and
then
in
the
1880s,
the
long
island
railroad
started
hauling
so-called
farmer
wagons
on
flatcars
with
the
team
right
on
the
same
train
in
a
specially
built
boxcar.
so,
i
would
say
the
modern
resur
--
or
the
modern
development
of
it
began
in
1926
but
the
real
resurgence
came
in
1954.
after
the
commission
had
laid
down
all
these
principles
and
movement
of
highway
trailers
by
rail,
and
the
railroads
thought,
“okay,
now,
we
have
the
ground
rules,
let's
go
out
and
start
with
this
thing.”
and
among
those
ground
rules
were
that
motor
carrier
or
that
railroads
handled
trailers
for
shippers
under
tariffs
and
they
handled
trailers
for
motor
carriers
under
through
route
arrangements
voluntarily
entered
into.
i
would
suggest
another
principal
reason
why
the
motor
carriers
want
to
have
--
i
mean,
the
railroads
want
to
have
a
motor
carrier
as
their
partners
and
not
as
their
shippers,
is
that
we
get
the
right
to
agree
in
advance
how
we
are
going
to
provide
the
service.
the
motor
carrier
can't
just
suddenly
show
up
at
one
of
our
terminals
on
a
snowy
friday
afternoon
and
say,
“here
are
our
hundred
trailers,
move
them.”
mr.

require

to
provide

trailer
and
go
pick
them
up
because
both
are
all
inclusive
tariffs
or
open
tariffs.
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
only
our
ramp
to
ramp
tariffs
are
open
tariffs.
all
our
tariffs
are
open
tariffs.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
would
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
would
suggest
that
with
the
motor
carrier's
imbalance,
the
imbalance
of
freight

united
states,
in
other
words,
more

in
one
direction

in
another
that
he
could
successfully
transfer
his
empty
return
to
us
which
would
increase
our
cost
and
consequently
our
prices.
i
would
just
suggest
that
when
we
can
enter
into
an
arrangement
or
an
agreement
with
the
motor
carrier,
we
can
meet
with
him
and
say,
“look,
we
don't
want
this.
you're
authorized
to
serve
trenton,
new
jersey.
we
don't
want
you
to
turn
it
over
to
us
at
trenton.
you're
also
authorized
to
interchange
traffic
at
kearny,
new
jersey
up
near

we
have

here.
we
have
the
cranes.
“give
it
to
us
at
kearny,
don't
dump
it
on
us
in
trenton”.
and
if
he
would
refuse
to
a
reasonable
request
like
that,
we
wouldn't
have
a
contract
that
we
could
have
entered
into.

he
did
well.
mr.
thomas
i'm
sure
is
going
to
cover
that
but
he
can
be
both
a
carrier
and
a
shipper
because
the
congress
said
he
could.
they
gave
him
the
specific
right
to
ship
which
is
something
the
motor
carriers
don't
have.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
question
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
compel
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
railroads
and
motor
carriers.
now,
that's
something
that
i
think
some
find
shocking.
i
know
i
did
when
i
first
discovered
it
because
i
thought
the
commission
could
compel
a
railroad
to
do
just
about
anything.
but
i
think
that
lies
at
the
root
of
this
case
because
i
think
what
the
commission
has
done
by
rules
2
and
3
is
try
to
overcome
this
lack
of
power
it
had
to
compel
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
supply
it
through
the
device
of
these
rules.
we
submit
that
rules
2
and
3
do
result
in
through
motor-rail
routes
and
therefore
in
--
are
invalid
as
beyond
the
authority
of
the
commission.
now
what
is
a
through
route?
i
think
very
basically
and
simply,
a
through
route
is
an
arrangement
either
expressed
or
implied
between
connecting
carriers
for
the
carriage,
for
the
continuous
carriage
of
goods
over
the
lines
of
such
carriers.
in
other
words,
there's
no
need
for
the
shipper
once
he's
tendered
it
to
the
originating
carrier
to
intervene
again,
he
gets
a
through
movement
almost
by
the
name,
a
continuous
movement
over
the
lines
of
two
or
more
carriers.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
physically
the
transportation
which
rules
2
and
3
would
produce,
meets
every
test
of
through
motor-rail
transportation.
the
motor
carrier
would
pick
it
up
from
the
shipper
under
his
tariff.
he
would
bring
it
to
the
railroad
terminal,
turn
it
over
to
the
railroad,
ask
them
to
move
it
to
their
ramp,
take
it
back
and
deliver
it
to
the
shipper.
now,
that
is
the
traditional
example
of
a
through
motor-rail-motor
movement.
now,
when
we
raised
this
contention
before
the
commission,
they
had
one
answer
to
it.
they
said
even
conceding
these
were
through
routes,
they
weren't
compulsory
and
they
said
that
because
the
motor
carrier
didn't
have
to
use
the
service,
well,
that's
right.
but
then
they
also
said
there
was
no
duty
on
the
railroads
to
publish
any
trailer-on-flatcar
tariffs.
in
other
words,
they
were
suggesting
that
we
could
completely
abandon
our
trailer-on-flatcar
business,
our
tremendous
investment
in
it,
if
we
didn't
want
the
motor
carriers
to
use
our
tariffs
and
therefore,
the
continued
maintenance
of
our
tariffs
and
what
i
suggest
are
these
through
motor-rail
routes
was
voluntary.
i
suggest
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
ridiculous
as
a
matter
of
common
sense.
i
suggest
that
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
because
once
we
have
all
this
equipment
and
facilities,
under
section
1
(4)
of
the
act,
a
shipper
upon
a
reasonable
request
can
require
us
to
produce
the
transportation
and
publish
charges
for
it.
i
would
suggest
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
it's
like
saying
that
the
man
who
gave
up
his
wallet
to
the
robber
on
the
threat
--
your
money
or
your
life
did
so
voluntarily
because
he
had
a
choice.
now
on
brief,
the
government
and
the
commission
and
the
motor
carriers
try
a
new
attack.
they
say,
these
aren't
through
routes
because
there's
no
holding
out
so
even
if
compulsory,
rules
2
and
3
don't
violate
the
statute.
and
for
this
effort,
they
cite
one
sentence
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
thompson
versus
united
states
which
did
say
that
the
test
of
a
through
route
is
a
holding
out
by
the
carriers.
but
of
course,
what
the
court
was
examining
in
thompson
was
a
voluntary
through
route.
the
commission
had
decided
not
to
use
its
compulsory
powers
in
thompson
but
had
found
the
existence
of
a
voluntary
through
route.
well,
of
course,
if
you're
looking
to
see
whether
a
voluntary
through
route
has
been
established,
it's
quite
appropriate
to
see
if
there's
been
a
holding
out
by
the
carriers.
i
would
also
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
holding
out
by
the
railroads
and
that's
our
real
objection,
our
real
complaint.
the
motor
carriers
hold
it
out
for
us.
they're
going
to
hold
out
without
our
consent,
without
our
prior
agreement,
a
motor-rail
motor
service.
now,
also
in
this
case
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
you
rate
--
you
pose
a
very
difficult
question,
mr.
chief
justice
because
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well,
you
see,
once
you
select
produce
mr.
chief
justice,
you've
happen
to
pick
a
commodity
that
the
motor
carriers
can
handle
without
regulation
under
the
agriculture
exemption.
we
are
regulated
in
the
handling
of
produce.
if
you
would
take
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
iron
and
steel
ball
bearings
or
something
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
alright.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
it
is
a
particularly
difficult
question
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
--
because
--
let's
take
steel
widgets.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i
would
suggest
that
a
railroad
has
no
more
right
to
ship
over
a
motor
carrier
than
a
motor
carrier
has
to
ship
over
a
railroad
and
i
say
that's
none.
i
would
say
that
if
a
railroad
wants
to
get
a
motor
carrier
to
handle
part
of
its
business,
let's
take
the
iron
steel
widgets
to
a
point
outside
the
terminal
area.
now,
we
can
handle
them
ourselves
inside
the
terminal
area
because
the
congress
specifically
gave
us
that
power.
but
outside
the
terminal
area,
we
have
to
find
a
motor
carrier
who
is
willing
to
enter
into
a
through
route
arrangement
with
us
just
like
if
he
wants
to
have
rail
service
as
a
part
of
his
through
movement,
he's
going
to
find
a
railroad
that's
willing
to
handle
it
with
him.
it
cuts
both
ways.
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
suggest
that
once
a
railroad
holds
out
or
agrees
to
join
in
a
through
route
with
motor
carriers,
it
couldn't
charge
its
subsidiary
a
dollar
and
any
other
motor
carrier
$2
because,
216
(c)
puts
on
railroads
the
duty
to
establish
nondiscriminatory,
non-prejudicial
divisions
among
those
motor
carriers
that
it
does
choose
to
join
with.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no.
i
don't
say
that
there's
an
absolute,
a
compulsion
to
enter
in
because
that
would
mean
that
once
you
entered
into
a
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you've
entered
--
entered
into
it
with
two
truck
lines,
you
can't
have
a
division
with
one
that's
a
dollar
and
a
division
with
another
one
that's
$2.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
because
the
commission
has
the
right
under
216
(c)
and
216
(f)
to
proscribe
the
divisions
of
joint
motor-rail
rates
and
the
parties
to
them
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
216
(c).
mr.
paul
r.
duke
it
says,
in
the
case
of
such
joint
rates,
meaning,
voluntary
motor-rail
rates
or
charges,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
carriers
parties
thereto
to
establish
just
and
reasonable
regulations
and
practices
in
connection
therewith
and
just
and
reasonable
and
equitable
divisions
thereof
as
between
the
carriers
participating
therein
which
shall
not
unduly
prefer
or
prejudice
any
of
such
participating
carriers.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
that
would
prevent
any
railroad
from
entering
into
divisions
--
different
division
arrangements
as
between
the
motor
carriers
with
whom
it
does
enter
into.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
it
refers
to
preference
and
prejudice
your
honor
which
normally
as
a
comparison
as
between
one
here
and
one
over
here.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
generally,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
it
might
go
beyond.
it's
--
it
--
the
commission
has
the
power
to
determine
upon
the
filing
by
railroad
of
its
tariff
what
a
reasonable
terminal
area
is.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
you
mean
he
wants
to
bring
it
to
us
as
the
shipper
and
ship
it
to
--
over
our
line?
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no.
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
a
holding
out
because
i
say
the
motor
carrier
has
no
right
to
ship
because
of
the
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no
sir.
not
unless
it
had
chosen
to
enter
into
a
joint
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no.
i
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
fortas
--
fortas
that
the
motor
carrier
has
no
right
to
ship
over
the
railroad,
but
if
the
railroad
chooses
to
enter
into
a
through
route
arrangement
within,
then
they
will
perform
that
service
pursuant
to
their
through
route
agreement.
i
suspect
what
is
troubling
the
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
--
we
hold
our
service
out
to
any
shipper
who
has
a
legitimate
right
to
use
it
but
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
but
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
but
that
a
motor
carrier
because
of
his
federally
regulated
status
as
a
carrier,
when
he
turns
traffic
over
to
a
railroad,
he
has
created
a
through
motor-rail
route.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that's
correct
because
the
trucker
has
no
right
to
ship.
i
would
suspect
that
the
real
--
we
think
we
have
the
best
of
the
statutory
and
the
technical
legal
arguments
but
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
what
is
most
troublesome
to
most
people
who
hear
about
this
is
“what's
the
matter
with
you
railroads,
why
don't
you
want
this
business?
why
don't
you
want
motor
carriers
to
come
to
you
and
turn
trailers
over
to
you
under
your
tariff?”
well,
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
many,
many
practical
reasons
why
railroads
want
to
have
the
right
to
agree
in
advance
to
enter
in
the
through
route
arrangements
where
they
can
negotiate
all
of
the
various
provisions
that
are
entailed
in
a
through
route
service.
first
of
all,
now
the
quite
simple
answer
and
that
is
the
railroads
are
quite
naturally
weary
of
their
motor
carrier
competitors
bearing
gifts
but
that's
no
real
practical
answer.
the
answer
it
seems
to
me
is
that
motor
carrier
has
no
obligation
to
turn
all
of
his
business
over
to
us
or
any
specific
portion
of
it.
therefore,
the
business
that
he
is
liable
to
turn
over
to
us
is
the
business
that
there
is
the
most
difficulty
in
handling.
now,
mr.
ginnane
suggested
that
the
motor
carriers
are
reasonable
men
and
they
would
make
arrangements
in
advance.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
advancement
of
the
railroads
piggyback
service
is
not
necessarily
the
principle
or
a
prime
aim
of
the
highway
carriers
in
this
country.
but
secondly,
there
is
the
practical
problem
that
much
freight
in
this
country
is
one-directional,
and
one
of
the
principle
cost
items
which
raises
transportation
prices
is
the
problem
of
empty
return
that
you
have
to
move
back
to
the
origin
locations
where
much
of
the
traffic
originates
empty
equipment.
well,
the
fact
is,
if
a
motor
carrier
can
ship
via
us,
he
can
turn
over
to
us
this
surplus
or
one-way
business
that
he
has
for
which
he
can't
set
up
a
balance
movement.
and
therefore,
we'll
have
to
confront
ourselves
not
only
with
our
own
empty
return
but
with
his
also.
this
would
tend
to
raise
railroad
costs
and
also
consequently
raise
railroad
prices,
all
to
the
benefit
of
our
competitor
who
would
be
continuing
to
publish
rates
for
an
all-highway
service.
i
will
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
the
railroads
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
the
first
evidence
of
it
was
actually
boat-on-flatcar
service.
it
began
back
in
1843
where
a
railroad
was
moving
canal
boats
on
flatcars.
it
kind
of
died
out
in
the
late
50s
and
then
in
the
1880s,
the
long
island
railroad
started
hauling
so-called
farmer
wagons
on
flatcars
with
the
team
right
on
the
same
train
in
a
specially
built
boxcar.
so,
i
would
say
the
modern
resur
--
or
the
modern
development
of
it
began
in
1926
but
the
real
resurgence
came
in
1954.
after
the
commission
had
laid
down
all
these
principles
and
movement
of
highway
trailers
by
rail,
and
the
railroads
thought,
“okay,
now,
we
have
the
ground
rules,
let's
go
out
and
start
with
this
thing.”
and
among
those
ground
rules
were
that
motor
carrier
or
that
railroads
handled
trailers
for
shippers
under
tariffs
and
they
handled
trailers
for
motor
carriers
under
through
route
arrangements
voluntarily
entered
into.
i
would
suggest
another
principal
reason
why
the
motor
carriers
want
to
have
--
i
mean,
the
railroads
want
to
have
a
motor
carrier
as
their
partners
and
not
as
their
shippers,
is
that
we
get
the
right
to
agree
in
advance
how
we
are
going
to
provide
the
service.
the
motor
carrier
can't
just
suddenly
show
up
at
one
of
our
terminals
on
a
snowy
friday
afternoon
and
say,
“here
are
our
hundred
trailers,
move
them.”

go

up

both
are
all

or
open
tariffs.
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
only
our

tariffs
are
open
tariffs.
all
our
tariffs
are
open
tariffs.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
would
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
would
suggest
that
with
the
motor
carrier's
imbalance,
the
imbalance
of
freight

united

other
words,

one
direction

in
another
that
he
could
successfully
transfer
his
empty
return
to
us
which
would
increase
our
cost
and
consequently
our
prices.
i
would
just
suggest
that
when
we
can
enter
into
an
arrangement
or
an
agreement
with
the
motor
carrier,
we
can
meet
with
him
and
say,
“look,
we
don't
want
this.
you're
authorized
to
serve
trenton,
new
jersey.
we
don't
want
you
to
turn
it
over
to
us
at
trenton.
you're
also
authorized
to
interchange
traffic
at
kearny,

here.
we
have
the
cranes.
“give
it
to
us
at
kearny,
don't
dump
it
on

and
if
he
would
refuse
to
a
reasonable
request
like
that,
we
wouldn't
have
a
contract
that
we
could
have
entered
into.

mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
would
know
--
on
the
bill
of
lading,
we
would
know
that
it
was
freight
all
kinds
most
generally
which
was
just
a
generic
description
and
then
he
would
also
provide
us
with
a
manifest
sometime
later
listing
all
of
the
individual
shipments.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
oh
yes,
because
he
did
well.
mr.
thomas
i'm
sure
is
going
to
cover
that
but
he
can
be
both
a
carrier
and
a
shipper
because
the
congress
said
he
could.
they
gave
him
the
specific
right
to
ship
which
is
something
the
motor
carriers
don't
have.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
