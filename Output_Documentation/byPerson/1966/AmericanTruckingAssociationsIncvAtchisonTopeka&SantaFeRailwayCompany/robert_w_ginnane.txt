mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
i
am
sharing
the
argument
with
mr.
sigmon
who
is
counsel
for
the
motor
carrier
associations
in
the
case.
these
are
consolidated
appeals
from
that
part
of
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
held
unlawful
two
rules
prescribed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
respect
to
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
often
referred
to
as
piggyback.
the
rules
involved
are
printed
at
pages
74
up
to
75
of
the
government's
brief.
rule
1,
in
effect,
defines
tofc
service
or
piggyback
as
the
transportation
of
truck
trailers
and
railroad
flatcars.
rules
2
and
3
are
the
rules
which
were
declared
unlawful
by
the
court
below.
rule
2
entitled
available
--
availability
to
all
tofc
service
provides
that
tofc
service,
if
offered
by
a
rail
carrier
through
it's
open-tariff
publications,
shall
be
made
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
no
less
than
that
receives
of
any
person
or
persons
were
doing
for
him
or
them,
a
like
and
contemporaneous
service
for
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
similar
circumstances
and
conditions.
the
second
rule,
rule
3
provides
and
accepts
as
otherwise
prohibited
by
these
rules
motor
common
and
contract
carriers,
water
common
and
contract
carriers,
and
freight
forwarders
may
use
tofc
service
for
all
or
any
part
of
their
authorized
service.
for
convenience,
all
the
parties
argued
this
case
as
though
it
involves
only
the
utilization
of
real
piggyback
services
by
motor
carriers.
thus,
in
our
brief,
we
stated
the
questions
as
to
whether
commission
acted
within
its
authority
in
ruling
that
railroads
which
offered
piggyback
services
to
the
shipping
public
must
offer
it
on
the
same
terms
to
motor
carriers.
and
secondly,
that
subject
to
a
certain
restrictions,
motor
carriers
are
entitled
to
use
rail
piggyback
service
in
the
performance
of
their
own
authorized
services.
for
a
brief
background
as
a
generality,
large
quantities
of
freight
can
be
moved
for
long
distances,
most
cheaply
by
rail.
however,
for
the
many
shippers
and
consignees
not
located
on
rail
tracks,
traditional
rail
transportation
has
limitations.
it
involves
loading
the
freight
on
a
truck,
transfer
it
to
the
railhead,
unloading
into
a
railroad
car
and
the
reverse
procedure
at
the
other
end
of
the
rail
movement.
the
characteristic
flexibility
of
the
motor
carrier
is
the
ability
to
pick
up
freight
at
a
shipper's
door
and
transfer
it
in
a
single
movement
to
the
door
of
a
consignee.
and
so
during
recent
years,
both
for
hire
motor
carriers
and
private
motor
carriers,
that
is
shippers
owning
their
own
motor
vehicles,
came
to
comprise
a
large
and
growing
segment
of
intercity
transportation.
tofc
service
or
piggyback
combines
the
flexible
door-to-door
service
of
the
motor
carrier,
motor
vehicle
with
the
line
haul
efficiency
of
the
railroad
or
stated
in
a
recently
published
study
by
the
commission
of
bureau
of
economics,
piggyback
combines
the
advantages
of
movement
by
truck
with
the
long
haul
economies
of
rail
under
conditions
which
hold
total
expense
to
a
minimum.
now,
no
one
suggest
that
piggyback
is
always
more
efficient
than
all
rail
or
all
motor
transportation.
but
no
party
in
this
case
disputes,
however,
that
this
is
so
for
many
movements
involving
relatively
long
hauls.
piggyback
service
has
had
a
dramatic
development
from
a
mere
trickle
in
1954.
by
1965,
the
railroads
had
moved
--
were
moving
in
that
year
1,430,000
trailers
in
piggyback
service.
and
that
produced
rail
gross
revenues
of
$384
million
or
4.3%
of
total
rail
gross
revenues.
tofc
or
piggyback
service
has
been
performed
--
is
being
performed
under
five
basic
arrangements
which
are
in
popular
industry
usage
called
plans
i,
ii,
iii,
iv,
and
v.
under
plan
i,
the
shipper's
property
is
carried
in
a
motor
carrier's
trailer
at
motor
carrier
rates
and
on
the
motor
carrier's
bill
of
lading
with
the
motor
carrier
making
an
arrangement
with
the
railroad
to
substitute
rail
movement,
piggyback
rail
movement
for
part
of
the
long
--
all
are
part
of
the
long
haul
trip.
plan
--
under
plan
ii,
the
railroad
offers
its
own
trailers
to
shippers
for
a
door-to-door
service
using
piggyback
for
the
line
haul
movement.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
those
other
railroad's
trucks
operated
by
its
personnel
or
it
can
--
or
it
can
hire
a
local
hauler
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
it's
--
it's
an
all
rail
operation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
under
plan
iii,
the
railroad
offers
to
--
to
haul
trailers
owned
by
other
persons,
say
shippers
or
freight
forwarders
from
railhead
to
railhead
at
a
flat
charge
without
pick
up
or
delivery.
under
plan
iv,
the
shipper
furnishes
both
the
trailer
and
the
flatcar
with
the
--
with
the
railroad
providing
only
motor
power
and
rails.
plan
v
is
the
classical
joint
arrangement,
joint
rate
arrangement
between
a
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
for
a
through
service
which
the
--
the
then
joint
rate
is
negotiated
between
the
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
and
embodied
in
their
official
tariffs.
the
property
moves
on
a
rail
or
motor
bill
of
lading
depending
upon
whether
the
railroad
or
the
motor
carrier
originates
the
shipment.
to
show
the
relative
use
made
at
the
plans,
in
1965,
23%
moved
--
and
23%
of
the
trailers
move
in
plan
i,
42%
in
plan
ii,
the
all-rail
--
the
all-rail
method,
26%
in
plan
iii,
5%
in
plan
iv,
and
4%
in
plan
v,
the
joint
rail
motor.
you'll
see
that
plans
i
and
v
are
bimodal
plans
involving
a
coordination
of
rail
and
motor
carrier
services.
plan
ii
is
essentially
an
all-rail
plan.
and
plans
iii
and
iv
are
the
open-tariff
plans
and
that
they
are
not
inter-carrier
arrangements
but
are
published
operate
in
tariffs
to
the
shipping
public,
to
shippers
and
freight
forwarders.
the
net
competitive
result
of
piggybacking
is
this,
traditionally,
only
motor
carriers
could
provide
a
flexible
door-to-door
service.
however,
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
this
case,
all
three,
rail
carrier,
motor
carrier
and
freight
forwarder
today
provide
through
the
use
of
piggyback
services
which
in
physical
characteristics
are
substantially
identical.
anyone
of
the
three
can
offer
a
transportation
service
which
the
door-to-door
pickup
is
by
--
is
by
motor
vehicle.
the
freight
is
on
a
trailer
and
the
trailer
is
moved
for
line
haul
in
tofc,
rail
tofc
or
piggyback
service.
but
a
crucial
fact
is
this.
railroads
can
provide
shippers
with
a
complete
door-to-door
piggyback
service
without
utilizing
independent
motor
carriers.
motor
carriers
cannot
provide
such
a
service
without
using
the
facilities
of
a
railroad.
the
tofc
rules
here
involved
resulted
from
the
commission's
biggest
investigation
of
piggybacking.
an
investigation
and
rulemaking
--
an
investigation
and
rulemaking
procedure
which
began
in
june
1962,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
to
state
that
three
factors
led
to
the
institution
of
this
procedure.
the
commission
had
stated
before
in
1939
and
in
1954
that
it
was
repugnant
to
the
act,
the
motor
carrier
to
act
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
and
as
a
shipper
by
railroad.
and
that
was
widely
interpreted
to
mean
that
a
motor
carrier
could
not
utilize
these
open-tariff
piggyback
tariffs
of
the
railroads
such
as
plans
iii
and
iv.
that
meant
that
the
rail
motor
coordinated
service
was
being
forced
in
the
plans
i
and
v
which
are
voluntary
arrangements
and
in
which
the
roads
may
refused
to
join,
and
some
have.
secondly,
the
whole
major
development
of
piggybacking
has
taken
place
since
1954
when
the
commission
last
looked
at
the
problem.
and
third,
in
april
1962,
president
kennedy
had
recommended
that
congress
enact
a
legislation
to
ensure
all
carriers
the
right
to
ship
on
the
carriers
of
other
branches
of
the
transportation
industry
at
the
same
rates
available
to
non-carrier
shippers.
so
it
seemed
clear
to
the
commission
that
that
time
was
right
for
a
fresh
look.
now,
on
a
more
current
record
and
more
detailed
record,
the
commission's
notice
a
rulemaking
announced
that
the
proceeding
would
embrace
every
aspect
of
piggybacking
including
the
extent
of
which
motor
carriers,
water
carriers,
should
be
permitted
to
use
plans
iii
and
iv,
the
open-tariff
rail
rates
and
services
following
the
receipt
of
written
presentations
on
examiner's
report
in
an
oral
argument
before
the
entire
showing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
apply
the
prohibition
which
it
found
in
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
ii
and
iii.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
3.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
invoked
2
specifically
and
invoked
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
believe
on
the
nashville
case
which
i
should
discuss
later
which
was
based
upon
section
3
(1).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
these
are
essentially
--
these
two
rules
are
essentially
interpreted
rules,
other
rules
which
are
promulgated
at
the
same
time,
other
tofc
rules
in
dealing
with
such
matters
as
the
details
of
tariff
publication
are
under
express
authority
to
issue
rules
governing
tariffs.
the
commission
emphasized
in
its
report
that
all
tofc
service
is
inherently
bimodal
and
that
its
basic
characteristic
is
the
combination
of
the
inherent
advantages
of
rail
and
motor
transportation.
and
the
commission
stated
that
it
is
obvious
to
us
that
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
mode
of
transportation
can
be
given
free
as
plates
with
the
highest
degree
of
coordination.
and
that
encouragement
of
such
coordination
is
in
the
public
interest.
we
contend
that
contrary
to
the
decision
below
that
the
commission
correctly
concluded
that
the
inters
--
that
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
forbid
the
railroads
to
discriminate
with
respect
of
the
availability
or
terms
of
piggyback
service
upon
the
basis
of
the
sender's
identity
and
so
charge
a
higher
rate
or
flatly
refuse
service
altogether
to
a
motor
carrier
tendering
its
trailers
for
shipment.
in
its
report
and
the
report
appears
in
the
back
of
the
second
printed
volume
of
the
record,
in
its
report
at
page
385
--
335,
the
commission
referred
specifically
for
this
proposition
to
section
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
requires
railroads
to
make
like
and
contemporaneous
service
in
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
less
or
less
than
that
received
from
any
other
person.
the
commission
concluded,
we
see
no
reason
why
the
fact
that
the
user
of
a
service
was
another
carrier
rather
than
a
private
shipper
would
compel
the
conclusion
that
this
similar
circumstances
and
conditions
were
present,
and
the
commission
modeled
its
rule
on
section
2.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
contend
that
this
court
has
an
effect
equated
to
the
withholding
of
service
with
discriminatory
rates
under
2.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
that
in
any
event
if
we
are
wrong
there,
that
a
carrier
which
is
tendering
freight
to
another
carrier
is
a
shipper,
is
a
patron
of
the
second
carrier
under
section
3
(1)
and
must
be
treated
on
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
same
terms
as
another
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir,
immediately.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so
i
say
the
commission
modeled
its
rule
in
--
partly
verbatim
upon
the
provisions
of
section
2,
where
it
provided
that
if
a
railroad
offers
tofc
service
to
shippers,
it
must
make
it
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
no
less
than
that
received
on
any
other
persons
for
doing
for
them
a
like
and
contemporaneous
service
in
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions.
now,
the
appellees
contend
and
the
lower
court
held
that
section
2
of
the
act
relates
only
to
discrimination
on
rates
and
does
not
apply
to
a
total
denial
of
service.
they
also
contend
that
section
3
(1)
with
which
--
which
is
in
pari
materia
to
section
2
only
prohibits
a
carrier
from
discriminating
between
shippers
and
provides
no
protection
for
a
carrier
acting
as
a
shipper
in
tendering
freight
to
another
carrier.
the
principal
evil
at
which
the
entire
act
was
directed
was
discrimination
in
all
its
forms
that
this
court
held
in
--
in
new
york
case.
and
we
contend
that
under
this
court's
decisions,
when
a
carrier
tenders
a
shipment
of
freight
to
another
carrier
for
transportation,
this
first
carrier
must
be
treated
as
a
patron
of
a
second
and
is
protected
against
the
discrimination
prohibited
by
section
2
and
3
(1).
to
begin
with,
in
wight
v.
united
states,
in
167
u.s.
and
in
later
cases,
this
court
reiterated
that
section
2's
phrase
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions
refers
to
the
physical
transportation
of
--
the
principal
transportation
characteristics,
not
to
various
competitive
considerations.
at
the
same
time
other
decisions
made
it
clear
that
it
is
immaterial
that
the
sender
of
the
freight
is
a
carrier.
for
example,
on
icc
v.
baltimore
&
ohio,
in
225
u.s.
this
court
held
that
section
2
prohibited
a
railroad
from
establishing
for
coal
shipped
by
another
railroad
for
its
own
use,
rates
lower
than
those
applicable
to
coal
shipped
for
the
uses
--
for
other
uses.
and
this
court
said
it
is
not
the
relationship
of
one
railroad
to
another
with
which
we
have
any
concern
here,
but
the
relation
of
a
railroad
to
its
patrons,
in
that
case
an
--
another
railroad
which
it
could
not
favor
just
because
it
was
a
railroad.
we
think
closely
in
point
as
this
court's
decision
in
icc
v.
delaware
and
lackawanna,
in
220
u.s.,
in
that
case
this
court
held
unlawful,
the
practice
of
some
railroads
of
charging
less
than
carload
rates
on
carload
shipments
presented
by
freight
forwarders.
the
rates
charged
that
freight
forwarders
were
substantially
higher
than
the
carload
rates
charged
other
shippers
who
submitted
--
who
presented
carload
shipments.
and
this
court
said
that
that
discrimination
was
improper
even
though
the
freight
forwarders
were
competitors
of
the
railroads,
in
the
sense
that
if
they
were
permitted
to
use
the
carload
rates
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
225
u.s.--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
326,
they
could
sift
off
a
portion
of
the
rail
revenues
from
less
than
carload
truck.
these
cases
clearly
stand
for
the
principle
that
when
it
turn
--
when
a
carrier
tenders
freight
to
another
carrier
for
a
transportation
the
first
carrier
is
a
patron
of
the
second,
as
a
patron,
as
a
shipper
he
must
be
treated
with
equality
with
other
shippers.
he
cannot
be
favored
as
the
attempt
was
on
some
of
these
cases.
he
may
not
be
discriminated
against
as
--
as
in
the
lackawanna
case.
we
submit
that
this
principle
of
equal
rate
treatment
enunciated
in
such
cases
as
the
lackawanna
case
applies
equally
to
the
greater
discrimination
involved
in
a
complete
refusal
to
serve.
this
court
recognized
in
the
lackawanna
case
that
the
practical
economic
effects
of
a
total
refusal
to
serve
and
exacting
a
discriminatorily
high
rate
are
precisely
the
same.
but
even
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
this,
the
same
result
follows
from
section
3
(1)
of
the
act,
that's
in
our
brief
at
page
71
which
admittedly
prohibits
both
rate
and
service
discriminations
between
shippers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
did
not
mention
section
3
in
haec
verba
but
at
page
336
of
its
report,
it
relies
upon
and
discusses
the
louisville
&
nashville
decision
in
282
u.s.
760
which
is
a
3
(1)
case.
in
the
louisville
&
nashville
case
which
the
commission
relied
upon,
this
court
held
that
section
3
(1)
was
violated
when
a
railroad
moved
private
passenger
and
office
cars
owned
by
another
railroad
at
lower
rates
than
it
moved
such
cars
when
owned
by
other
persons.
this
case
again
makes
it
clear
that
for
the
purpose
of
--
purposes
of
section
3
--
3
(1)
that
when
a
carrier
tenders
goods
as
a
shipper
it
is
entitled
under
section
3
(1)
to
the
same
but
only
the
same
treatment
as
any
other
shipment.
now,
the
appellees
contend
and
the
court
below
held
that
motor
carriers
desiring
to
use
rail
piggyback
service
are
excluded
from
the
protection
on
section
3
(1)
by
the
proviso
in
section
3
(1)
which
reads
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
discrimination,
prejudice
or
disadvantage,
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier
of
whatever
description.
in
our
brief,
we
demonstrate
that
the
purpose
of
this
proviso
was
to
ensure
that
the
sweeping
antidiscriminatory
provisions
of
section
3
(1)
did
not
apply
to
the
rate
and
other
practices
by
which
a
carrier
seeks
to
divert
traffic
from
other
carriers.
we
point
out
that
nothing
in
the
purposes
or
history
of
the
proviso
even
suggests
that
it
was
intended
to
authorize
a
railroad
to
refuse
to
accept
a
shipment
tendered
by
a
motor
carrier
on
the
same
terms
that
it
accepts
shipments
from
everybody
else.
it
briefly
contend
that
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
prohibit
a
railroad
which
offers
tofc
services
to
the
shipping
public
from
refusing
to
make
it
available
upon
the
same
terms
to
motor
carriers.
i
should
like
to
refer
to
some
obvious
economic
implications
of
the
commission's
rules
2
and
3
in
relation
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transpiration
policy
which
the
commissions
has
commanded
both
by
the
policy
itself
and
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
keep
in
mind
and
apply
in
administering
and
interpreting
the
act.
that
policy
states
that
it
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
national
transportation
policy
to
provide
for
a
fair
and
impartial
regulation
of
all
modes
of
transportation,
so
administered
as
to
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
to
promote
economical
and
efficient
service
all
to
the
end
of
developing
and
coordinating
and
preserving
a
national
transportation
system.
as
to
the
policies
objective
of
preserving
the
inherent
advantages
of
each,
the
commission
pointed
out,
had
found
at
page
322,
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
benefit
which
tofc
service
has
already
rendered
the
railroads
in
allowing
them
to
recapture
traffic
loss
to
competing
modes
of
transportation
and
especially
the
private
carriage.
also
benefiting
had
been
the
motor
carriers
which
had
been
provided
an
opportunity
through
the
use
of
plan
i
of
tofc
service
that
the
railroads
will
concur
and
abuse,
to
obtain
efficient
line
haul
transportation
for
themselves,
and
thus,
to
help
themselves
even
while
their
business
helps
the
rail
competitors.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
commission's
tofc
rules
2
and
3
do
not
require
a
railroad
to
move
a
single
trailer
load
at
less
than
compensatory
rates.
assuming
that
their
open-tariff
rates
for
tofc
service
are
compensatory,
we
have
not
yet
heard
a
plausible
reason
as
to
why
they
should
not
welcome
the
piggyback
business
tendered
by
motor
carriers.
in
their
various
briefs,
they
conjure
up
horrible
operating
problems
which
they
say
would
be
created
if
they
must
allow
motor
carriers
to
utilize
piggyback
service.
i
think
one
of
them
is
that
they
would
be
--
have,
could
have
a
lot
of
trailers
dropped
down
on
late
friday
afternoon.
the
simple
answer
to
all
that
sort
of
conjure
--
conjuncture
problem
is
that
the
railroad's
duty
under
section
1
(4)
is
to
provide
transportation
upon
reasonable
demand.
a
motor
carrier
like
a
large
shipper
can
get
good
piggyback
service
only
by
detailed
planning
and
coordination
with
the
railroad.
it
would
be
like
general
motors,
at
noon
asking
a
railroad
for
a
thousand
flatcars
of
--
for
the
next
morning,
that
sort
of
thing
just
doesn't
happened
in
highly
coordinated
transportation
operations.
again,
it
is
undisputed
that
piggyback
tofc
is
the
only
significant
technique
which
has
been
developed
for
coordinated
rail
motor
carrier
service.
the
national
transportation
policy
talks
about
it,
everybody's
been
talking
about
the
need
for
coordinated
service
for
decades,
this
is
the
only
possibility
which
has
developed.
the
commission's
rules
permit
and
encourage
motor
carriers
to
use
it
whenever
they
find
it
advantageous
to
do
so.
to
the
extent
that
this
happens
and
the
rapid
growth
of
plan
i
operations
in
which
motor
carriers
do
permit
--
can
permit,
can
participate
if
the
railroads
agree,
it
will
occur
on
a
substantial
scale
and
it
will
generally
will
reflect
a
more
advantageous
use
of
the
nation's
transportation
resources
including
perhaps
some
relief
of
congestion
on
--
on
our
highways.
basically,
all
the
arguments
of
the
railroads
actually
affect
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
national
transportation
policy
are
too
rigid
to
permit
this
pouring
of
new
line
into
the
old
bottle.
in
a
similar
situation,
they
took
essentially
the
same
position
and
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
united
states
v.
pennsylvania
railroad,
in
323
u.s.
in
1945,
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
black.
it
really
sounds
like
this,
in
that
case
the
seatrain
lines
had
--
had
devised
an
economical
method
of
carrying
loaded
railroad
cars
on
specially
designed
ships.
the
railroads
refused
to
interchange
cars
to
seatrain
and
the
act
did
not
specifically
require
them
to
do
so.
however,
looking
to
their
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
this
court
sustained
the
commission's
order
requiring
the
railroads
to
interchange
cars
with
seatrain.
and
hereto,
we
submit,
that
implementation
of
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
requires
that
the
commission
be
upheld
in
construing
the
act
as
prohibiting
a
motor
carrier
from
offering
piggyback
service
to
the
shipping
public
unless
it
makes
it
available
on
the
equal
terms
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
motor
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
323
u.s.
612.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
was
asked
this
morning,
why
the
railroads
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
question
was
asked
this
morning
as
to
why
the
railroads
are
unwilling
to
accept
the
tender
of
traffic
from
a
motor
carrier
at
rates
which
presumably
are
compensatory.
the
same
rates
which
they
offer
tofc
service
to
the
shipping
company.
you
got
only
one
answer
and
there's
only
one
answer
really
in
the
railroads
briefs
and
that
is
that
it
would
create
shipping
problems.
it's
a
myth.
they
conjure
up
the
prospect
of
the
railroad
having
dump
on
it
at
4
o'clock
in
a
friday
afternoon,
a
100
load
of
trailers
by
a
motor
carrier.
in
today's
transportation
operations
that
sort
of
thing
doesn't
happen.
if
a
big
shipper
wants
motor
carriers
--
wants
piggyback
service
on
any
sort
of
a
scale
which
is
100
trailers
a
week.
he
must
sit
down
with
the
railroad
weeks
in
advance
and
they
schedule
this
traffic
so
that
the
railroad
will
have
that
equipment
in
position
regularly
at
a
certain
time
everyday.
and
similarly,
any
motor
carrier
that
wants
to
utilize
at
any
significant
scale
the
piggyback
service
of
a
railroad,
has
got
to
sit
down
and
participate
in
the
same
process
of
planning
and
coordination.
to
give
you
a
simpler
example,
if
at
3
o'clock
this
afternoon
i
called
up
mayflower
van
lines
and
said,
“now
i
want
to
move
tomorrow
morning
at
9
o'clock.”
frankly,
i'd
be
lucky
if
i've
got
service
within
three
or
four
days.
these
people
have
to
schedule
their
operations
otherwise
they're
wasting
equipment.
they
don't
have
it
in
position.
and
the
railroads
operating
problems
would
be
just
the
same
in
dealing
with
a
motor
carrier
as
it
would
be
in
dealing
with
a
big
shipper.
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
position
of
the
railroad
appellants
in
this
court.
the
western
and
southeastern
except
southern,
the
western,
southeastern
and
eastern
railroads,
while
they
contend
that
under
the
act,
a
railroad
--
a
motor
carrier
can
perform
only
motor
carrier
operations
in
a
motor
vehicle
over
the
highway.
there
--
they
concede
a
big
qualification
of
that.
they
say,
except
if
we
concur
than
they
--
than
they
can
operate
--
operate,
they
can
utilize
piggyback
service.
and
they
say,
all
except
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
that
the
motor
carrier
can
participate
in
piggybacking
in
two
ways,
one
under
plan
v
and
one
under
plan
i.
now,
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
in
taking
the
same
position
carry
to
the
--
carry
it
further,
they
would
knockout
motor
carrier
participation
in
plan
i
and
indeed,
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
have
a
separate
lawsuit
to
accomplish
that
pending
down
on
the
three-judge
court
in
dallas,
texas.
now
you're
told,
congress
has
provided
for
joint
service
between
the
rail
and
motor
carriers
in
classical
through
route
and
joint
rate
arrangements
and
that
this
will
take
care
of
all
--
of
--
of
all
in
need
in
this
area.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
in
1965,
out
of
piggyback
movement
of
trailers
of
one
--
over
1,400,000,
only
4%
took
place
under
plan
v
in
classical
through
route
joint
rate
arrangements
where
the
business
has
done
primarily
under
the
all-rail
plan,
plan
ii
which
was
related
plan
ii
and
a
half,
42%
of
the
trailers
moved
under
plans
ii
and
ii
and
a
half;
next,
under
plan
iii,
the
open
tariff
not
available
to
motor
carriers,
26%.
the
only
significant
motor
carrier
participation
and
utilization
of
piggyback
services
was
under
plan
i
which
accounted
for
23%
and
as
i
say
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
are
trying
to
knockout
plan
i
which
would
mean
that
the
motor
carriers
in
terms
of
the
history
to
date
would
participate
in
about
4%
of
trailer
on
flatcar
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
indeed
and
the
appellees
make
much
of
it
that
in
1939
and
again
in
1959
in
the
movement
of
trailers
by
rail,
the
commission
said,
to
act
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
and
as
a
shipper
by
rail
as
to
the
same
service
is
repugnant
to
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir.
neither
in
1939,
in
1954
or
1956
has
the
commission
explained
the
theory
--
that
theory
or
repugnancy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
didn't
even
explain
why
in
1936
it
had
held
the
contrary
and
that
is
what
it
is
now
holding.
back
in
1936,
the
commission
said,
we
have
here
a
published
rail
tariff
and
a
motor
carrier
would
have
the
same
right
to
make
shipments
there
under
as
any
member
of
a
body
forwarder.
the
commission
has
indeed
changed
its
position.
it's
going
back
to
its
1936
position
as
a
result
of
its
most
comprehensive
investigation
of
trailer
and
flatcar
services.
an
investigation
made
at
the
time
when
it
is
now
a
reality,
at
the
rate
of
1,400,000
trailers
a
year,
whereas
in
a
prior
investigation
in
1940,
piggybacking
was
just
a
dream.
there
was
so
little
bit
of
going
on
that
we
don't
even
have
statistics,
nobody
kept
statistics.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
case
really
represents
the
railroad's
traditional
position
that
a
coordinated
transportation
system
which
is
an
objective
of
the
national
transportation
policy
can
be
achieved
only
on
their
terms.
it's
no
accident
that
there
a
very
few
rail-motor
joint
rates
in
existence
in
this
country
and
that
very
few
piggyback
trailers
move
under
rail-motor
carrier
joint
rates.
in
1941,
the
railroad
industry
entered
into
a
consent
decree
outlying
concerted
refusal
to
enter
into
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
motor
carriers.
later
in
united
states
against
pennsylvania
in
323
u.s.,
this
court
had
to
sustain
the
commission's
order
requiring
the
railroads
to
interchange
cars
with
sea
trade
thereby
making
that
new
technological
service
feasible.
this
case
involves
more
than
a
lot
of
questions
of
technical,
highly
technical
statutory
interpretation.
it
means
enabling
and
encouraging
motor
carriers
to
divert
their
trailers
from
crowded
highways
to
the
excess
capacity
of
the
railroad
system.
and
at
that
time,
when
the
nation
is
confronted
with
railroad
proposals
for
a
restructuring
of
the
rail
system,
large
--
largely
on
the
ground
at
intermodal
competition,
mostly
motor
carrier
competition
will
continue
to
provide
the
competitive
leaven
in
the
loaf
that
therefore
railroad
should
be
allowed
to
achieve
the
admitted
economies
of
restructuring.
we
submit
that
this
is
no
time
to
interpret
the
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
motor
carriers
to
determine
--
the
railroads
to
determine
the
extent
of
motor
carrier
utilization
of
piggyback
services.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
i
understand,
the
legislation
leading
to
the
enactment
of
part
iv
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
provides
for
the
regulation
of
the
freight
forwarders.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
we
don't
think
so.
now,
if
they're
talking
about
recently
proposed
legislation
sponsored
some
of
them
by
the
commission,
the
commission
has
recommended
to
congress
that
it
would
be
given
authority
to
require
railroads
and
motor
carriers
to
participate
in
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
also
that
it
would
be
given
authority
to
require
motor
carriers
to
participate
in
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
each
other.
the
questions
are
somewhat
different
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
understood
the
counsel
for
the
western
railroads
to
state
that
under
section
216
(c),
if
a
railroad
enters
into
joint
rates
with
two
or
more
motor
carriers
that
the
commission
can
require
equal
divisions
that
each
of
the
motor
carriers
get
the
same
division
on
the
same
service.
now,
we
submit
that
section
216
clearly
does
not
give
such
a
power
to
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
only
empowers
the
commission
to
pass
upon
the
division
of
the
joint
rate
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
between
the
carriers
that
participate
in
the
particular
joint
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
not
sure
there
is
but
i
am
clear
that
216
(c)
does
not
give
us
the
power
to
do
anything
about
it,
after
all,
the
--
the
divisions
of
a
joint
rate
or
ordinarily,
primarily
on
a
matter
of
agreement
between
the
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is,
correct
sir.
that
they
must
treat
the
motor
carriers
tendering
freight
for
shipment
on
the
trailer
as
a
patron
of
the
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
most
important
difference
is
this.
when
the
motor
carrier
takes
advantage
of
an
open
tariff
say
under
plan
iii
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
tenders
freight
under
an
open
--
a
railroad
open
tariff
such
as
plan
iii,
in
that
case,
the
rate
is
fixed
solely
by
the
railroad
by
its
unilateral
act.
all
--
all
we
say
is
that
the
motor
carrier
has
the
same
right
to
use
that
rate
as
other
shippers
do
--
as
freight
forwarders
do.
in
a
joint
rate
arrangement,
they
agree,
the
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
jointly
agree
as
to
what
the
rate
shall
be
whereas
under
the
open
tariff,
the
railroad
fixes
its
own
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
are
authorized
to
enter
into
joint
rates
under
216
(c).
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
compel
them
to
enter
into
joint
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
yes,
there
is.
the
commission
is
empowered
to
require
railroads
to
participate
in
joint
rates
and
it
can
require
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
to
participate
in
a
joint
rate
but
we
cannot
require
a
motor
carrier
to
participate
in
a
joint
rate
with
anybody.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
may
do
so
voluntarily.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
in
--
with
respect
to
railroads
and
motor
carriers?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
voluntary
on
the
part
of
each.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
can't
require
either
of
them
to
enter
into
a
joint
rate
with
the
other.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
say
a
joint
rate
of
--
involving
two
railroads
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
i
am
sharing
the
argument
with
mr.
sigmon
who
is
counsel
for
the
motor
carrier
associations
in
the
case.
these
are
consolidated
appeals
from
that
part
of
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
held
unlawful
two
rules
prescribed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
respect
to
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
often
referred
to
as
piggyback.
the
rules
involved
are
printed
at
pages
74
up
to
75
of
the
government's
brief.
rule
1,
in
effect,
defines
tofc
service
or
piggyback
as
the
transportation
of
truck
trailers
and
railroad
flatcars.
rules
2
and
3
are
the
rules
which
were
declared
unlawful
by
the
court
below.
rule
2
entitled
available
--
availability
to
all
tofc
service
provides
that
tofc
service,
if
offered
by
a
rail
carrier
through
it's
open-tariff
publications,
shall
be
made
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
no
less
than
that
receives
of
any
person
or
persons
were
doing
for
him
or
them,
a
like
and
contemporaneous
service
for
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
similar
circumstances
and
conditions.
the
second
rule,
rule
3
provides
and
accepts
as
otherwise
prohibited
by
these
rules
motor
common
and
contract
carriers,
water
common
and
contract
carriers,
and
freight
forwarders
may
use
tofc
service
for
all
or
any
part
of
their
authorized
service.
for
convenience,
all
the
parties
argued
this
case
as
though
it
involves
only
the
utilization
of
real
piggyback
services
by
motor
carriers.
thus,
in
our
brief,
we
stated
the
questions
as
to
whether
commission
acted
within
its
authority
in
ruling
that
railroads
which
offered
piggyback
services
to
the
shipping
public
must
offer
it
on
the
same
terms
to
motor
carriers.
and
secondly,
that
subject
to
a
certain
restrictions,
motor
carriers
are
entitled
to
use
rail
piggyback
service
in
the
performance
of
their
own
authorized
services.
for
a
brief
background
as
a
generality,
large
quantities
of
freight
can
be
moved
for
long
distances,
most
cheaply
by
rail.
however,
for
the
many
shippers
and
consignees
not
located
on
rail
tracks,
traditional
rail
transportation
has
limitations.
it
involves
loading
the
freight
on
a
truck,
transfer
it
to
the
railhead,
unloading
into
a
railroad
car
and
the
reverse
procedure
at
the
other
end
of
the
rail
movement.
the
characteristic
flexibility
of
the
motor
carrier
is
the
ability
to
pick
up
freight
at
a
shipper's
door
and
transfer
it
in
a
single
movement
to
the
door
of
a
consignee.
and
so
during
recent
years,
both
for
hire
motor
carriers
and
private
motor
carriers,
that
is
shippers
owning
their
own
motor
vehicles,
came
to
comprise
a
large
and
growing
segment
of
intercity
transportation.
tofc
service
or
piggyback
combines
the
flexible
door-to-door
service
of
the
motor
carrier,
motor
vehicle
with
the
line
haul
efficiency
of
the
railroad
or
stated
in
a
recently
published
study
by
the
commission
of
bureau
of
economics,
piggyback
combines
the
advantages
of
movement
by
truck
with
the
long
haul
economies
of
rail
under
conditions
which
hold
total
expense
to
a
minimum.
now,
no
one
suggest
that
piggyback
is
always
more
efficient
than
all
rail
or
all
motor
transportation.
but
no
party
in
this
case
disputes,
however,
that
this
is
so
for
many
movements
involving
relatively
long
hauls.
piggyback
service
has
had
a
dramatic
development
from
a
mere
trickle
in
1954.
by
1965,
the
railroads
had
moved
--
were
moving
in
that
year
1,430,000
trailers
in
piggyback
service.
and
that
produced
rail
gross
revenues
of
$384
million
or
4.3%
of
total
rail
gross
revenues.
tofc
or
piggyback
service
has
been
performed
--
is
being
performed
under
five
basic
arrangements
which
are
in
popular
industry
usage
called
plans
i,
ii,
iii,
iv,
and
v.
under
plan
i,
the
shipper's
property
is
carried
in
a
motor
carrier's
trailer
at
motor
carrier
rates
and
on
the
motor
carrier's
bill
of
lading
with
the
motor
carrier
making
an
arrangement
with
the
railroad
to
substitute
rail
movement,
piggyback
rail
movement
for
part
of
the
long
--
all
are
part
of
the
long
haul
trip.
plan
--
under
plan
ii,
the
railroad
offers
its
own
trailers
to
shippers
for
a
door-to-door
service
using
piggyback
for
the
line
haul
movement.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
those
other
railroad's
trucks
operated
by
its
personnel
or
it
can
--
or
it
can
hire
a
local
hauler
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
it's
--
it's
an
all
rail
operation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
under
plan
iii,
the
railroad
offers
to
--
to
haul
trailers
owned
by
other
persons,
say
shippers
or
freight
forwarders
from
railhead
to
railhead
at
a
flat
charge
without
pick
up
or
delivery.
under
plan
iv,
the
shipper
furnishes
both
the
trailer
and
the
flatcar
with
the
--
with
the
railroad
providing
only
motor
power
and
rails.
plan
v
is
the
classical
joint
arrangement,
joint
rate
arrangement
between
a
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
for
a
through
service
which
the
--
the
then
joint
rate
is
negotiated
between
the
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
and
embodied
in
their
official
tariffs.
the
property
moves
on
a
rail
or
motor
bill
of
lading
depending
upon
whether
the
railroad
or
the
motor
carrier
originates
the
shipment.
to
show
the
relative
use
made
at
the
plans,
in
1965,
23%
moved
--
and
23%
of
the
trailers
move
in
plan
i,
42%
in
plan
ii,
the
all-rail
--
the
all-rail
method,
26%
in
plan
iii,
5%
in
plan
iv,
and
4%
in
plan
v,
the
joint
rail
motor.
you'll
see
that
plans
i
and
v
are
bimodal
plans
involving
a
coordination
of
rail
and
motor
carrier
services.
plan
ii
is
essentially
an
all-rail
plan.
and
plans
iii
and
iv
are
the
open-tariff
plans
and
that
they
are
not
inter-carrier
arrangements
but
are
published
operate
in
tariffs
to
the
shipping
public,
to
shippers
and
freight
forwarders.
the
net
competitive
result
of
piggybacking
is
this,
traditionally,
only
motor
carriers
could
provide
a
flexible
door-to-door
service.
however,
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
this
case,
all
three,
rail
carrier,
motor
carrier
and
freight
forwarder
today
provide
through
the
use
of
piggyback
services
which
in
physical
characteristics
are
substantially
identical.
anyone
of
the
three
can
offer
a
transportation
service
which
the
door-to-door
pickup
is
by
--
is
by
motor
vehicle.
the
freight
is
on
a
trailer
and
the
trailer
is
moved
for
line
haul
in
tofc,
rail
tofc
or
piggyback
service.
but
a
crucial
fact
is
this.
railroads
can
provide
shippers
with
a
complete
door-to-door
piggyback
service
without
utilizing
independent
motor
carriers.
motor
carriers
cannot
provide
such
a
service
without
using
the
facilities
of
a
railroad.
the
tofc
rules
here
involved
resulted
from
the
commission's
biggest
investigation
of
piggybacking.
an
investigation
and
rulemaking
--
an
investigation
and
rulemaking
procedure
which
began
in
june
1962,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
to
state
that
three
factors
led
to
the
institution
of
this
procedure.
the
commission
had
stated
before
in
1939
and
in
1954
that
it
was
repugnant
to
the
act,
the
motor
carrier
to
act
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
and
as
a
shipper
by
railroad.
and
that
was
widely
interpreted
to
mean
that
a
motor
carrier
could
not
utilize
these
open-tariff
piggyback
tariffs
of
the
railroads
such
as
plans
iii
and
iv.
that
meant
that
the
rail
motor
coordinated
service
was
being
forced
in
the
plans
i
and
v
which
are
voluntary
arrangements
and
in
which
the
roads
may
refused
to
join,
and
some
have.
secondly,
the
whole
major
development
of
piggybacking
has
taken
place
since
1954
when
the
commission
last
looked
at
the
problem.
and
third,
in
april
1962,
president
kennedy
had
recommended
that
congress
enact
a
legislation
to
ensure
all
carriers
the
right
to
ship
on
the
carriers
of
other
branches
of
the
transportation
industry
at
the
same
rates
available
to
non-carrier
shippers.
so
it
seemed
clear
to
the
commission
that
that
time
was
right
for
a
fresh
look.
now,
on
a
more
current
record
and
more
detailed
record,
the
commission's
notice
a
rulemaking
announced
that
the
proceeding
would
embrace
every
aspect
of
piggybacking
including
the
extent
of
which
motor
carriers,
water
carriers,
should
be
permitted
to
use
plans
iii
and
iv,
the
open-tariff
rail
rates
and
services
following
the
receipt
of
written
presentations
on
examiner's
report
in
an
oral
argument
before
the
entire
showing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
apply
the
prohibition
which
it
found
in
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
ii
and
iii.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
3.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
invoked
2
specifically
and
invoked
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
believe
on
the
nashville
case
which
i
should
discuss
later
which
was
based
upon
section
3
(1).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
these
are
essentially
--
these
two
rules
are
essentially
interpreted
rules,
other
rules
which
are
promulgated
at
the
same
time,
other
tofc
rules
in
dealing
with
such
matters
as
the
details
of
tariff
publication
are
under
express
authority
to
issue
rules
governing
tariffs.
the
commission
emphasized
in
its
report
that
all
tofc
service
is
inherently
bimodal
and
that
its
basic
characteristic
is
the
combination
of
the
inherent
advantages
of
rail
and
motor
transportation.
and
the
commission
stated
that
it
is
obvious
to
us
that
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
mode
of
transportation
can
be
given
free
as
plates
with
the
highest
degree
of
coordination.
and
that
encouragement
of
such
coordination
is
in
the
public
interest.
we
contend
that
contrary
to
the
decision
below
that
the
commission
correctly
concluded
that
the
inters
--
that
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
forbid
the
railroads
to
discriminate
with
respect
of
the
availability
or
terms
of
piggyback
service
upon
the
basis
of
the
sender's
identity
and
so
charge
a
higher
rate
or
flatly
refuse
service
altogether
to
a
motor
carrier
tendering
its
trailers
for
shipment.
in
its
report
and
the
report
appears
in
the
back
of
the
second
printed
volume
of
the
record,
in
its
report
at
page
385
--
335,
the
commission
referred
specifically
for
this
proposition
to
section
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
requires
railroads
to
make
like
and
contemporaneous
service
in
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
less
or
less
than
that
received
from
any
other
person.
the
commission
concluded,
we
see
no
reason
why
the
fact
that
the
user
of
a
service
was
another
carrier
rather
than
a
private
shipper
would
compel
the
conclusion
that
this
similar
circumstances
and
conditions
were
present,
and
the
commission
modeled
its
rule
on
section
2.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
contend
that
this
court
has
an
effect
equated
to
the
withholding
of
service
with
discriminatory
rates
under
2.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
that
in
any
event
if
we
are
wrong
there,
that
a
carrier
which
is
tendering
freight
to
another
carrier
is
a
shipper,
is
a
patron
of
the
second
carrier
under
section
3
(1)
and
must
be
treated
on
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
same
terms
as
another
shipper.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir,
immediately.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so
i
say
the
commission
modeled
its
rule
in
--
partly
verbatim
upon
the
provisions
of
section
2,
where
it
provided
that
if
a
railroad
offers
tofc
service
to
shippers,
it
must
make
it
available
to
any
person
at
a
charge
no
greater
and
no
less
than
that
received
on
any
other
persons
for
doing
for
them
a
like
and
contemporaneous
service
in
the
transportation
of
a
like
kind
of
traffic
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions.
now,
the
appellees
contend
and
the
lower
court
held
that
section
2
of
the
act
relates
only
to
discrimination
on
rates
and
does
not
apply
to
a
total
denial
of
service.
they
also
contend
that
section
3
(1)
with
which
--
which
is
in
pari
materia
to
section
2
only
prohibits
a
carrier
from
discriminating
between
shippers
and
provides
no
protection
for
a
carrier
acting
as
a
shipper
in
tendering
freight
to
another
carrier.
the
principal
evil
at
which
the
entire
act
was
directed
was
discrimination
in
all
its
forms
that
this
court
held
in
--
in
new
york
case.
and
we
contend
that
under
this
court's
decisions,
when
a
carrier
tenders
a
shipment
of
freight
to
another
carrier
for
transportation,
this
first
carrier
must
be
treated
as
a
patron
of
a
second
and
is
protected
against
the
discrimination
prohibited
by
section
2
and
3
(1).
to
begin
with,
in
wight
v.
united
states,
in
167
u.s.
and
in
later
cases,
this
court
reiterated
that
section
2's
phrase
under
substantially
similar
circumstances
and
conditions
refers
to
the
physical
transportation
of
--
the
principal
transportation
characteristics,
not
to
various
competitive
considerations.
at
the
same
time
other
decisions
made
it
clear
that
it
is
immaterial
that
the
sender
of
the
freight
is
a
carrier.
for
example,
on
icc
v.
baltimore
&
ohio,
in
225
u.s.
this
court
held
that
section
2
prohibited
a
railroad
from
establishing
for
coal
shipped
by
another
railroad
for
its
own
use,
rates
lower
than
those
applicable
to
coal
shipped
for
the
uses
--
for
other
uses.
and
this
court
said
it
is
not
the
relationship
of
one
railroad
to
another
with
which
we
have
any
concern
here,
but
the
relation
of
a
railroad
to
its
patrons,
in
that
case
an
--
another
railroad
which
it
could
not
favor
just
because
it
was
a
railroad.
we
think
closely
in
point
as
this
court's
decision
in
icc
v.
delaware
and
lackawanna,
in
220
u.s.,
in
that
case
this
court
held
unlawful,
the
practice
of
some
railroads
of
charging
less
than
carload
rates
on
carload
shipments
presented
by
freight
forwarders.
the
rates
charged
that
freight
forwarders
were
substantially
higher
than
the
carload
rates
charged
other
shippers
who
submitted
--
who
presented
carload
shipments.
and
this
court
said
that
that
discrimination
was
improper
even
though
the
freight
forwarders
were
competitors
of
the
railroads,
in
the
sense
that
if
they
were
permitted
to
use
the
carload
rates
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
225
u.s.--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
326,
they
could
sift
off
a
portion
of
the
rail
revenues
from
less
than
carload
truck.
these
cases
clearly
stand
for
the
principle
that
when
it
turn
--
when
a
carrier
tenders
freight
to
another
carrier
for
a
transportation
the
first
carrier
is
a
patron
of
the
second,
as
a
patron,
as
a
shipper
he
must
be
treated
with
equality
with
other
shippers.
he
cannot
be
favored
as
the
attempt
was
on
some
of
these
cases.
he
may
not
be
discriminated
against
as
--
as
in
the
lackawanna
case.
we
submit
that
this
principle
of
equal
rate
treatment
enunciated
in
such
cases
as
the
lackawanna
case
applies
equally
to
the
greater
discrimination
involved
in
a
complete
refusal
to
serve.
this
court
recognized
in
the
lackawanna
case
that
the
practical
economic
effects
of
a
total
refusal
to
serve
and
exacting
a
discriminatorily
high
rate
are
precisely
the
same.
but
even
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
this,
the
same
result
follows
from
section
3
(1)
of
the
act,
that's
in
our
brief
at
page
71
which
admittedly
prohibits
both
rate
and
service
discriminations
between
shippers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
did
not
mention
section
3
in
haec
verba
but
at
page
336
of
its
report,
it
relies
upon
and
discusses
the
louisville
&
nashville
decision
in
282
u.s.
760
which
is
a
3
(1)
case.
in
the
louisville
&
nashville
case
which
the
commission
relied
upon,
this
court
held
that
section
3
(1)
was
violated
when
a
railroad
moved
private
passenger
and
office
cars
owned
by
another
railroad
at
lower
rates
than
it
moved
such
cars
when
owned
by
other
persons.
this
case
again
makes
it
clear
that
for
the
purpose
of
--
purposes
of
section
3
--
3
(1)
that
when
a
carrier
tenders
goods
as
a
shipper
it
is
entitled
under
section
3
(1)
to
the
same
but
only
the
same
treatment
as
any
other
shipment.
now,
the
appellees
contend
and
the
court
below
held
that
motor
carriers
desiring
to
use
rail
piggyback
service
are
excluded
from
the
protection
on
section
3
(1)
by
the
proviso
in
section
3
(1)
which
reads
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
discrimination,
prejudice
or
disadvantage,
the
traffic
of
any
other
carrier
of
whatever
description.
in
our
brief,
we
demonstrate
that
the
purpose
of
this
proviso
was
to
ensure
that
the
sweeping
antidiscriminatory
provisions
of
section
3
(1)
did
not
apply
to
the
rate
and
other
practices
by
which
a
carrier
seeks
to
divert
traffic
from
other
carriers.
we
point
out
that
nothing
in
the
purposes
or
history
of
the
proviso
even
suggests
that
it
was
intended
to
authorize
a
railroad
to
refuse
to
accept
a
shipment
tendered
by
a
motor
carrier
on
the
same
terms
that
it
accepts
shipments
from
everybody
else.
it
briefly
contend
that
the
antidiscrimination
provisions
of
the
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
prohibit
a
railroad
which
offers
tofc
services
to
the
shipping
public
from
refusing
to
make
it
available
upon
the
same
terms
to
motor
carriers.
i
should
like
to
refer
to
some
obvious
economic
implications
of
the
commission's
rules
2
and
3
in
relation
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transpiration
policy
which
the
commissions
has
commanded
both
by
the
policy
itself
and
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
keep
in
mind
and
apply
in
administering
and
interpreting
the
act.
that
policy
states
that
it
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
national
transportation
policy
to
provide
for
a
fair
and
impartial
regulation
of
all
modes
of
transportation,
so
administered
as
to
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
to
promote
economical
and
efficient
service
all
to
the
end
of
developing
and
coordinating
and
preserving
a
national
transportation
system.
as
to
the
policies
objective
of
preserving
the
inherent
advantages
of
each,
the
commission
pointed
out,
had
found
at
page
322,
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
benefit
which
tofc
service
has
already
rendered
the
railroads
in
allowing
them
to
recapture
traffic
loss
to
competing
modes
of
transportation
and
especially
the
private
carriage.
also
benefiting
had
been
the
motor
carriers
which
had
been
provided
an
opportunity
through
the
use
of
plan
i
of
tofc
service
that
the
railroads
will
concur
and
abuse,
to
obtain
efficient
line
haul
transportation
for
themselves,
and
thus,
to
help
themselves
even
while
their
business
helps
the
rail
competitors.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
commission's
tofc
rules
2
and
3
do
not
require
a
railroad
to
move
a
single
trailer
load
at
less
than
compensatory
rates.
assuming
that
their
open-tariff
rates
for
tofc
service
are
compensatory,
we
have
not
yet
heard
a
plausible
reason
as
to
why
they
should
not
welcome
the
piggyback
business
tendered
by
motor
carriers.
in
their
various
briefs,
they
conjure
up
horrible
operating
problems
which
they
say
would
be
created
if
they
must
allow
motor
carriers
to
utilize
piggyback
service.
i
think
one
of
them
is
that
they
would
be
--
have,
could
have
a
lot
of
trailers
dropped
down
on
late
friday
afternoon.
the
simple
answer
to
all
that
sort
of
conjure
--
conjuncture
problem
is
that
the
railroad's
duty
under
section
1
(4)
is
to
provide
transportation
upon
reasonable
demand.
a
motor
carrier
like
a
large
shipper
can
get
good
piggyback
service
only
by
detailed
planning
and
coordination
with
the
railroad.
it
would
be
like
general
motors,
at
noon
asking
a
railroad
for
a
thousand
flatcars
of
--
for
the
next
morning,
that
sort
of
thing
just
doesn't
happened
in
highly
coordinated
transportation
operations.
again,
it
is
undisputed
that
piggyback
tofc
is
the
only
significant
technique
which
has
been
developed
for
coordinated
rail
motor
carrier
service.
the
national
transportation
policy
talks
about
it,
everybody's
been
talking
about
the
need
for
coordinated
service
for
decades,
this
is
the
only
possibility
which
has
developed.
the
commission's
rules
permit
and
encourage
motor
carriers
to
use
it
whenever
they
find
it
advantageous
to
do
so.
to
the
extent
that
this
happens
and
the
rapid
growth
of
plan
i
operations
in
which
motor
carriers
do
permit
--
can
permit,
can
participate
if
the
railroads
agree,
it
will
occur
on
a
substantial
scale
and
it
will
generally
will
reflect
a
more
advantageous
use
of
the
nation's
transportation
resources
including
perhaps
some
relief
of
congestion
on
--
on
our
highways.
basically,
all
the
arguments
of
the
railroads
actually
affect
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
national
transportation
policy
are
too
rigid
to
permit
this
pouring
of
new
line
into
the
old
bottle.
in
a
similar
situation,
they
took
essentially
the
same
position
and
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
united
states
v.
pennsylvania
railroad,
in
323
u.s.
in
1945,
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
black.
it
really
sounds
like
this,
in
that
case
the
seatrain
lines
had
--
had
devised
an
economical
method
of
carrying
loaded
railroad
cars
on
specially
designed
ships.
the
railroads
refused
to
interchange
cars
to
seatrain
and
the
act
did
not
specifically
require
them
to
do
so.
however,
looking
to
their
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
this
court
sustained
the
commission's
order
requiring
the
railroads
to
interchange
cars
with
seatrain.
and
hereto,
we
submit,
that
implementation
of
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
requires
that
the
commission
be
upheld
in
construing
the
act
as
prohibiting
a
motor
carrier
from
offering
piggyback
service
to
the
shipping
public
unless
it
makes
it
available
on
the
equal
terms
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
motor
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
323
u.s.
612.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
was
asked
this
morning,
why
the
railroads
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
question
was
asked
this
morning
as
to
why
the
railroads
are
unwilling
to
accept
the
tender
of
traffic
from
a
motor
carrier
at
rates
which
presumably
are
compensatory.
the
same
rates
which
they
offer
tofc
service
to
the
shipping
company.
you
got
only
one
answer
and
there's
only
one
answer
really
in
the
railroads
briefs
and
that
is
that
it
would
create
shipping
problems.
it's
a
myth.
they
conjure
up
the
prospect
of
the
railroad
having
dump
on
it
at
4
o'clock
in
a
friday
afternoon,
a
100
load
of
trailers
by
a
motor
carrier.
in
today's
transportation
operations
that
sort
of
thing
doesn't
happen.
if
a
big
shipper
wants
motor
carriers
--
wants
piggyback
service
on
any
sort
of
a
scale
which
is
100
trailers
a
week.
he
must
sit
down
with
the
railroad
weeks
in
advance
and
they
schedule
this
traffic
so
that
the
railroad
will
have
that
equipment
in
position
regularly
at
a
certain
time
everyday.
and
similarly,
any
motor
carrier
that
wants
to
utilize
at
any
significant
scale
the
piggyback
service
of
a
railroad,
has
got
to
sit
down
and
participate
in
the
same
process
of
planning
and
coordination.
to
give
you
a
simpler
example,
if
at
3
o'clock
this
afternoon
i
called
up
mayflower
van
lines
and
said,
“now
i
want
to
move
tomorrow
morning
at
9
o'clock.”
frankly,
i'd
be
lucky
if
i've
got
service
within
three
or
four
days.
these
people
have
to
schedule
their
operations
otherwise
they're
wasting
equipment.
they
don't
have
it
in
position.
and
the
railroads
operating
problems
would
be
just
the
same
in
dealing
with
a
motor
carrier
as
it
would
be
in
dealing
with
a
big
shipper.
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
position
of
the
railroad
appellants
in
this
court.
the
western
and
southeastern
except
southern,
the
western,
southeastern
and
eastern
railroads,
while
they
contend
that
under
the
act,
a
railroad
--
a
motor
carrier
can
perform
only
motor
carrier
operations
in
a
motor
vehicle
over
the
highway.
there
--
they
concede
a
big
qualification
of
that.
they
say,
except
if
we
concur
than
they
--
than
they
can
operate
--
operate,
they
can
utilize
piggyback
service.
and
they
say,
all
except
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
that
the
motor
carrier
can
participate
in
piggybacking
in
two
ways,
one
under
plan
v
and
one
under
plan
i.
now,
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
in
taking
the
same
position
carry
to
the
--
carry
it
further,
they
would
knockout
motor
carrier
participation
in
plan
i
and
indeed,
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
have
a
separate
lawsuit
to
accomplish
that
pending
down
on
the
three-judge
court
in
dallas,
texas.
now
you're
told,
congress
has
provided
for
joint
service
between
the
rail
and
motor
carriers
in
classical
through
route
and
joint
rate
arrangements
and
that
this
will
take
care
of
all
--
of
--
of
all
in
need
in
this
area.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
in
1965,
out
of
piggyback
movement
of
trailers
of
one
--
over
1,400,000,
only
4%
took
place
under
plan
v
in
classical
through
route
joint
rate
arrangements
where
the
business
has
done
primarily
under
the
all-rail
plan,
plan
ii
which
was
related
plan
ii
and
a
half,
42%
of
the
trailers
moved
under
plans
ii
and
ii
and
a
half;
next,
under
plan
iii,
the
open
tariff
not
available
to
motor
carriers,
26%.
the
only
significant
motor
carrier
participation
and
utilization
of
piggyback
services
was
under
plan
i
which
accounted
for
23%
and
as
i
say
southern
and
the
freight
forwarders
are
trying
to
knockout
plan
i
which
would
mean
that
the
motor
carriers
in
terms
of
the
history
to
date
would
participate
in
about
4%
of
trailer
on
flatcar
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
indeed
and
the
appellees
make
much
of
it
that
in
1939
and
again
in
1959
in
the
movement
of
trailers
by
rail,
the
commission
said,
to
act
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
and
as
a
shipper
by
rail
as
to
the
same
service
is
repugnant
to
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir.
neither
in
1939,
in
1954
or
1956
has
the
commission
explained
the
theory
--
that
theory
or
repugnancy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
didn't
even
explain
why
in
1936
it
had
held
the
contrary
and
that
is
what
it
is
now
holding.
back
in
1936,
the
commission
said,
we
have
here
a
published
rail
tariff
and
a
motor
carrier
would
have
the
same
right
to
make
shipments
there
under
as
any
member
of
a
body
forwarder.
the
commission
has
indeed
changed
its
position.
it's
going
back
to
its
1936
position
as
a
result
of
its
most
comprehensive
investigation
of
trailer
and
flatcar
services.
an
investigation
made
at
the
time
when
it
is
now
a
reality,
at
the
rate
of
1,400,000
trailers
a
year,
whereas
in
a
prior
investigation
in
1940,
piggybacking
was
just
a
dream.
there
was
so
little
bit
of
going
on
that
we
don't
even
have
statistics,
nobody
kept
statistics.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
case
really
represents
the
railroad's
traditional
position
that
a
coordinated
transportation
system
which
is
an
objective
of
the
national
transportation
policy
can
be
achieved
only
on
their
terms.
it's
no
accident
that
there
a
very
few
rail-motor
joint
rates
in
existence
in
this
country
and
that
very
few
piggyback
trailers
move
under
rail-motor
carrier
joint
rates.
in
1941,
the
railroad
industry
entered
into
a
consent
decree
outlying
concerted
refusal
to
enter
into
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
motor
carriers.
later
in
united
states
against
pennsylvania
in
323
u.s.,
this
court
had
to
sustain
the
commission's
order
requiring
the
railroads
to
interchange
cars
with
sea
trade
thereby
making
that
new
technological
service
feasible.
this
case
involves
more
than
a
lot
of
questions
of
technical,
highly
technical
statutory
interpretation.
it
means
enabling
and
encouraging
motor
carriers
to
divert
their
trailers
from
crowded
highways
to
the
excess
capacity
of
the
railroad
system.
and
at
that
time,
when
the
nation
is
confronted
with
railroad
proposals
for
a
restructuring
of
the
rail
system,
large
--
largely
on
the
ground
at
intermodal
competition,
mostly
motor
carrier
competition
will
continue
to
provide
the
competitive
leaven
in
the
loaf
that
therefore
railroad
should
be
allowed
to
achieve
the
admitted
economies
of
restructuring.
we
submit
that
this
is
no
time
to
interpret
the
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
motor
carriers
to
determine
--
the
railroads
to
determine
the
extent
of
motor
carrier
utilization
of
piggyback
services.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
i
understand,
the
legislation
leading
to
the
enactment
of
part
iv
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
provides
for
the
regulation
of
the
freight
forwarders.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
we
don't
think
so.
now,
if
they're
talking
about
recently
proposed
legislation
sponsored
some
of
them
by
the
commission,
the
commission
has
recommended
to
congress
that
it
would
be
given
authority
to
require
railroads
and
motor
carriers
to
participate
in
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
also
that
it
would
be
given
authority
to
require
motor
carriers
to
participate
in
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
each
other.
the
questions
are
somewhat
different
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
understood
the
counsel
for
the
western
railroads
to
state
that
under
section
216
(c),
if
a
railroad
enters
into
joint
rates
with
two
or
more
motor
carriers
that
the
commission
can
require
equal
divisions
that
each
of
the
motor
carriers
get
the
same
division
on
the
same
service.
now,
we
submit
that
section
216
clearly
does
not
give
such
a
power
to
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
only
empowers
the
commission
to
pass
upon
the
division
of
the
joint
rate
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
between
the
carriers
that
participate
in
the
particular
joint
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
not
sure
there
is
but
i
am
clear
that
216
(c)
does
not
give
us
the
power
to
do
anything
about
it,
after
all,
the
--
the
divisions
of
a
joint
rate
or
ordinarily,
primarily
on
a
matter
of
agreement
between
the
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is,
correct
sir.
that
they
must
treat
the
motor
carriers
tendering
freight
for
shipment
on
the
trailer
as
a
patron
of
the
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
most
important
difference
is
this.
when
the
motor
carrier
takes
advantage
of
an
open
tariff
say
under
plan
iii
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
tenders
freight
under
an
open
--
a
railroad
open
tariff
such
as
plan
iii,
in
that
case,
the
rate
is
fixed
solely
by
the
railroad
by
its
unilateral
act.
all
--
all
we
say
is
that
the
motor
carrier
has
the
same
right
to
use
that
rate
as
other
shippers
do
--
as
freight
forwarders
do.
in
a
joint
rate
arrangement,
they
agree,
the
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
jointly
agree
as
to
what
the
rate
shall
be
whereas
under
the
open
tariff,
the
railroad
fixes
its
own
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
are
authorized
to
enter
into
joint
rates
under
216
(c).
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
compel
them
to
enter
into
joint
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
yes,
there
is.
the
commission
is
empowered
to
require
railroads
to
participate
in
joint
rates
and
it
can
require
railroad
and
the
motor
carrier
to
participate
in
a
joint
rate
but
we
cannot
require
a
motor
carrier
to
participate
in
a
joint
rate
with
anybody.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
may
do
so
voluntarily.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
in
--
with
respect
to
railroads
and
motor
carriers?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
voluntary
on
the
part
of
each.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
can't
require
either
of
them
to
enter
into
a
joint
rate
with
the
other.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
say
a
joint
rate
of
--
involving
two
railroads
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir.
thank
you.
