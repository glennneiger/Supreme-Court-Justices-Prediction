mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
we
think
in
these
appeals
is
not
whether
this
decree
is
a
good
decree,
a
bad
decree,
whether
the
government
should
have
insisted
on
something
more.
we
think
the
question
here
is
basically
a
very
different
question
and
thus
more
important
question.
we
think
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
not
these
people
were
properly
denied
intervention
and
the
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
continental
situation,
we
think
was
a
very
different
question.
there
was
no
doubt
in
continental
that
the
case
was
properly
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
--
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
intervention
was
properly
denied
here.
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
to
dismiss
these
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
case
is
properly
here
to
consider
the
questions,
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
when
you
say
the
case
is
properly
here.
i
think
it
has
to
be
continental
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
problem
as
your
honor
indicated
whether
or
not
in
the
continental
situation,
the
court
could
consider
questions
going
beyond
the
assignments
of
error
and
the
court
said
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
well,
i
would
disagree
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
if
it
seems
that
this
is
as
charged
mr.
justice,
if
intervention
was
properly
denied
in
this
case,
if
these
appellants
were
properly
told,
they
had
no
interest
and
we're
not
in
this
case.
then
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
case
here
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
because
i
think
there's
no
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
not
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
the
parties
to
this
case
are
concerned
and
the
only
parties
thus
far
the
united
states
in
el
paso.
there
is
no
dispute
between
them.
they
have
settled
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
think
as
a
matter
of
power
the
court
would
have
that
power.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
because
of
the
complexities
of
this
problem.
if
the
court
should
hold
intervention
was
improperly
denied
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
consider
it.
but
our
point
is
that
alleged
to
reach
that
conclusion
unless
you
overcome
this
preliminary
hearing.
we
just
think
there's
no
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
a
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
a
very
cryptic
question.
it
appears
--
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
questions
that
bondholders
apparently
had
been
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
in
their
appeal.
now,
we
--
our
submission
here
today
is
if
the
district
court
properly
did
deny
intervention
under
the
applicable
standards
of
a
federal
rule
and
that
the
theory
upon
were
intervention
is
here
sought
and
a
theory
which
i
may
know
parenthetically
that
is
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
court's
consistently
have
rejected
would
have
very
grave
consequences
for
antitrust
enforcement
because
of
the
importance
of
the
consent
judgment
in
antitrust
procedures.
now,
the
critical
standards
are
set
forth
of
course
in
rule
24
which
is
set
forth
at
paragraph
3.
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
in
this
order.
first,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
contention
of
client
intervention
as
of
right
and
in
discussing,
i
can
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no
mr.
justice.
all
it
was
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
we
said
they
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
all
we
were
attempting
to
do
was
to
contrast
that
the
position
of
california
in
the
state
and
consulting
california
edison
which
would
have
been
standing
to
maintain
a
treble-damage
suit
with
the
standing
of
cascade
that
we
don't
believe
would
have
such
thing.
now,
i
shall
attempt
to
--
i
shall
discuss
this
first
in
terms
of
intervention
as
of
right
under
the
old
rule
because
that
is
we
think
the
rule
that
governed
and
then
i
will
turn
to
the
amendments
of
the
rule
and
explained
why
under
either
rule
we
don't
think
either
of
this
party
should
have
been
allowed
to
intervene.
and
secondly,
because
of
the
somewhat
different
position
apparently
taken
by
southern
california
edison
and
california
on
the
one
hand
as
people
who
are
interested
in
the
ability
of
the
new
company
to
compete
in
california
and
cascade
on
the
other
hand
which
seems
to
echo
that
argument,
they
also
suggest
the
possible
injury
to
itself
as
a
purchase
of
natural
gas
i
think
would
be
appropriate
to
take
up
these
two
considerations
separately.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
my
discussion
if
i
could
first
deal
with
the
question
of
intervention
and
when
i
get
into
the
question
intervention
and
touch
on
the
show
why
the
attorney
general's
representation
of
the
interest
involved
here
was
adequate
i
shall
take
up
and
discuss
the
various
attacks
that
have
been
made
upon
the
decree.
now,
let
me
first
turn
to
southern
california
edison
and
california's
claim
to
intervention
as
of
right.
as
the
rule
existed
before
its
amendment
last
summer,
the
two
possible
provisions
that
may
be
relevant
to
subparagraph
2
and
subparagraph
3.
subparagraph
2
permits
intervention
where
the
applicant
may
is
or
may
be
bound
by
the
judgment
and
were
the
representation
of
its
right
where
the
existing
party
is
inadequate.
i
will,
if
i
may
pass
for
the
minute
the
question,
the
adequacy
of
representation
which
i
will
discuss
under
the
new
rule.
but
let
me
come
to
the
question
of
bound.
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
under
this
court's
decision
of
the
sam
fox
case
a
few
terms
ago,
these
people
were
not
bound
by
this
judgment
because
the
teaching
of
sam
fox
says,
that
as
the
rule
uses
the
word
bound
means
bound
in
the
res
judicata
sense
and
that
you
are
not
bound
by
the
judgment,
even
though
the
practical
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
you
to
prevail
in
your
action.
indeed,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
revision
of
the
rule
was
a
recognition
by
the
revisers
that
it
was
rather
difficult
for
many
people
to
comply
with.
now,
the
other
sub
provision
of
the
rule
states
that
you
may
intervene
as
of
right
where
the
applicant
is
so
situated
to
be
adversely
affected
by
the
disposition
of
the
property
within
the
control
of
the
court.
now,
we
can
see
that
in
this
case
there
is
property
within
the
control
of
the
court
within
the
meaning
of
that
rule,
the
assets
to
be
divested.
but
here
we
think
their
argument
fails
because
they
don't
have
any
kind
of
interest
in
this
property
and
again,
it's
well
settled
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
standards
for
intervention
as
of
right
under
subsection
3
you've
got
to
have
some
kind
of
a
property
interest
in
the
property
under
control
of
the
court.
they
have
no
interest.
these
people
have
no
interest
in
the
assets
to
be
divested.
what
they
have
is
a
possible
course
of
action
against
the
el
paso
for
a
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
that
again
has
been
well
said
although
it's
not
enough.
now
the
amended
rule
which
was
effective
july
1,
1966
was
changed
to
eliminate
both
the
requirement
of
the
parties
be
bound
and
that
there
be
property
within
the
control
of
the
court.
the
rule
now
state
what
the
standards
that
there's
intervention
as
of
right
where
the
applicant
claims
an
interest
relating
to
the
property
or
transaction.
and
he
is
so
situated
at
the
disposition
of
the
action
may
as
a
practical
matter
impair
or
impede
feasibility
to
protect
that
but
this
rule
has
not
changed
the
requirement
that
but
he
also
must
show
that
he
was
--
interest
was
not
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
parties.
now
in
this
order
adopting
this
rule,
it
set
an
effect
the
court
set
in
effective
date
of
july
1,
1966
and
set
it
will
be
of
course
applicable
to
future
proceedings
and
in
addition
to
all
further
proceedings
in
actions
then
pending
unless
so
to
apply
would
result
would
work
in
justice.
now,
when
the
rule
speaks
of
further
proceedings,
it
seems
to
me
it
meant
proceedings
after
the
rule
was
adopted.
there
were
no
proceedings
in
the
district
court
after
this
rule
was
adopted.
indeed,
this
rule
was
adopted
approximately
six
months
after
this
court
had
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
pending
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
--
and
mr.
justice
i
also
point
out
that
this
court
of
course
is
reviewing
the
propriety
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
denying
intervention.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
as
appropriate
to
test
it
by
the
standards
which
were
in
existence
at
that
time.
and
also--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no
mr.
justice,
that's
about
i'm
coming
to
that
because
that's
my
very
next
point
that
even
assuming
the
amended
rule
does
apply
intervention
with
nevertheless
correctly
denied
because
as
i
have
mentioned
under
the
amended
rule
they
have
to
show
that
their
interest
was
not
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
parties.
now,
the
interest
that
california
or
in
southern
california
edison
are
seeking
to
assert
in
this
through
this
intervention
with
the
identical
interest
that
the
attorney
general
is
vindicating
that
is
the
correction
of
the
violations
and
the
restoration
of
pacific
northwest
as
an
effective
competitor
in
this
area.
and
we
think
that
both
as
a
matter
of
law
and
in
fact
the
attorney
general's
representation
of
that
interest
was
an
adequate
lone.
this
court
is
frequently
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
were
not
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
were
not
if
the
representation
was
not
adequate
then
we
would
say
they
have
made
a
case
for
intervention
that's
what
the
rule
says.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
well
first
let
me
just
say
that
as
i'll
come
to
a
moment,
we
don't
think
that
they
have
shown
that
this
is
inadequate
representation
in
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
--
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
because
this
goes
to
the
very
essence
of
the
settlement
process
that
this
goes
to
the
basic
question
that
seems
to
as
to
whether
the
attorney
general
can
be
charged
with
inadequately
representing
the
public
interest
because
he
settles
the
case
on
terms
that
people
who
may
be
effective
by
the
settlement
don't
think
it
was
adequate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
mr.
justice,
the
answer
is
that
under
our
adversary
system
of
litigation
the
basic
control
of
litigation
is
with
the
parties.
this
court
in
issuing
its
mandates
attempts
to
it
as
resolving
the
controversies
between
the
parties.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
to
be
--
there's
no
controversy
between
the
parties
anymore
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
that,
under
our
system
if
the
party
set
it's
controversy
there's
any
way
that
the
third
party
who
was
entered
thereby
can
challenge
that
except
by
doing
one
of
two
things
either
becoming
a
party
to
the
case
and
appealing
it
or
bringing
his
own
lawsuit.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
way
that
they
might
be
described
as
rowing
commissions
with
people
who
are
adversely
affected
by
decrees
which
they
don't
like
to
seek
judicial
review
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
when
you
say
properly
before
the
court,
i
think
for
him
to
be
here
properly
before
this
court
so
that
this
court
can
re-examine
the
question
of
compliance
that
that
requires
that
somehow
he'd
be
in
the
case
properly
and
we
think
these
people
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suppose,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
done
it
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
if
for
whatever
reasons
we
conclude
it
was
in
the
public
interest
we
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
our
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
is
that
under
our
system
they
cannot
be
heard
to
complain
that
the
government
is
settling
a
case
has
thrown
away
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
so
--
i
don't
think
this
court
unless
these
people
were
properly
parties
in
this
case
unless
they
were
entitled
to
get
into
this
case
when
the
court
speaks
of
a
case
being
properly
here,
i
think
that's
what
it
means.
someone
would
stand
to
challenge
the
judgment
below
has
brought
the
case
here
and
we
don't
think
these
people
have
standing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
say
mr.
justice
in
dealing
with
the
question,
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case
if
there
was
a
claim
of
bad
faith,
malfeasance,
nonfeasance,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
then
make
out
a
claim
for
intervention.
and
that
would
be
the
way
to
remedy
it
if
this
court
would
then
hold
that
they
have
been
improperly
denied
intervention.
if
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
with
all
due
respect
it
does
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
claim
is
that
the
government
is
acting
in
bad
faith
or
the
claim
is
only
that
the
attorney
general
made
a
mistake
in
settling
the
case
on
a
particular
term.
i'd
like
to
avert
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
sam
fox
case
where
it
said
that
sound
public
policy,
i'm
sorry,
sam
policy
would
strongly
lead
us
to
decline
appellants
invitation
to
asses
the
wisdom
of
the
court's
judgment
in
negotiating
and
accepting
the
1960
consent
decree
at
least
in
the
absence
of
any
claim
of
bad
faith
or
malfeasance
on
the
part
of
the
government.
now,
i
think
this
court
has
many
times
recognized
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
a
failure
to
perform
a
duty
in
this
sense
that
the
government
had
failed
to
take
into
consideration
certain
things.
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
a
claim
that
the
government
settled
the
case
on
two
narrow
terms.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
denied
that
of
course
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
say
we
don't
want
to
--
as
you
said
we
don't
want
to
get
to
that
point
because
we
think
they
haven't
made
a
sufficient
showing
on
the
basis
of
their
claim
to
entitle
them
to
intervene.
but
their
whole
claim
is
--
their
whole
claim
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
inadequately
represented
the
public.
now,
what
does
this
claim
rests
on?
this
claim
rests
on
the
contention
that
we
shouldn't
have
settled
the
case
on
these
terms,
we
should
have
asked
for
something
more
in
the
way
of
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
not
given
up
divestiture,
mr.
justice
black.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
mr.
justice
let
me
tell
it's
precisely
what
is
this
divestiture
decree
provides.
they
talk
about
giving
up
as
though
there
have
been
no
divestiture.
under
this
decree,
el
paso
gives
to
this
new
company
all
of
the
properties
that
it
originally
acquired
in
the
merger.
all
of
the
properties
plus
additions
and
improvements
to
those
properties
which
el
paso
made
during
the
period
they
had
controlled
the
property.
the
value
of
which
is
estimated
at
$100
million.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
token
divestiture.
this
is
a
very
complete
divestiture.
they
talked
about
the
gas
reserves.
their
complaint
about
the
gas
reserves
is
not
that
el
paso
is
keeping
any
of
the
reserves
it
got
from
pacific
northwest.
the
complaint
is
that
el
paso
is
not
giving
to
pacific
northwest
a
share
of
the
additional
reserves
that
el
paso
acquired
during
the
period
it
had
control
of
pacific
northwest.
the
record
shows
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
will
be
ultimately.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
will
be
ultimately.
du
pont
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
these
are
just
a
couple
of
quotations
i
think
that
he
was
referring
from
the
district
court
there
is
complete
divestiture.
let
me
explain
what
du
pont
thought.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe,
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it
is.
we
think
that
we've
given
back
everything
in
the
way
of
the
properties
to
which
they
are
entitled
and
there's
a
complete
severance
of
stock
control.
the
plan
is
originally
proposed
by
el
paso
which
the
government
objected.
the
principal
objection
we
had
to
that
plan
was
that
el
paso
proposed
to
distribute
the
stock
of
the
new
company
to
the
existing
el
paso
shareholders.
in
other
words,
what
el
paso
proposed
to
do
was
to
create
--
establish
a
new
company
and
i
might
mention
the
new
company
has
been
created
and
of
course
the
new
company
cannot
act
until
it
has
been
certificated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
new
company
has
been
created
and
the
federal
power
commission
proceedings
have
been
stayed
pending
the
determination
of
this
appeal.
el
paso
originally
proposed
to
turn
over
to
the
new
company
these
assets
to
take
the
stock
of
the
new
company
and
then
to
distribute
that
stock
with
certain
minor
exceptions
to
its
own
shareholders.
we
vigorously
opposed
this
because
we
said
this
would
not
ensure
a
separation
of
the
community
of
interest
between
the
two
companies.
since
they
advise
this
merger
as
this
court
held
in
its
previous
decision
was
that
it
for
the
possible
competition
of
pacific
northwest
to
serve
the
california
law,
we
didn't
think
it
would
be
a
fair
plan
under
which
any
strings
were
attached.
now,
there
were
lengthy
hearings
and
proceedings
in
this
case
the
record
here
of
the
divestiture
phase
occupies
by
printed
volumes
and
we
concede
that
during
the
course
of
those
proceedings,
we
oppose
a
plan
on
a
number
of
grounds.
after
the
record
was
closed,
we
studied
it
further.
and
el
paso
came
in
with
a
proposed
amended
plan
which
was
compromised.
el
paso
ceded
to
us
on
what
we
thought
was
a
principal
defect
of
a
plan
that
is
the
failure
to
ensure
separation
between
the
stockholders
of
the
new
and
the
old
company.
they
proposed
a
so-called
redding
decree,
named
after
the
old
redding
case.
under
which
the
stockholders
of
el
paso
wish
to
acquire
stock
of
the
new
company
would
have
to
give
up
their
el
paso
stock.
and
the
provision
is
that
80%
have
to
agree
to
this
for
tax
purposes
and
if
they're
unable
to
get
that
then
el
paso
would
undertake
to
sell
all
the
stock
of
the
new
company
to
--
through
a
public
offering.
in
addition
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
three
answers
to
that
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
at
the
insistence
of
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission,
the
new
company
has
now
retained
independent
counsel
to
represent
it
before
that
commission,
that's
the
first.
secondly,
the
department
of
justice
fully
considered
that
the
qualifications
of
the
new
principle
executive
offices
of
the
company,
mr.
clark,
the
new
chief
executive
officer
was
fully
examined
before
the
district
court
at
the
hearing
and
we
were
satisfied
that
he
is
a
completely
independent
man
and
he
was
asked
specifically
in
response
to
a
question
whether
when
the
company
is
established,
he
would
be
a
--
once
he
got
established
they
would
consider
competing
in
all
markets
including
california
and
he
said
yes.
so
that's
two
things.
third,
we
think
the
separation
of
the
stock
as
we
have
proposed
it
does
create
an
independent
entity.
this
is
a
company
that
is
--
will
be
free
from
the
control
of
el
paso.
now
it's
admittedly
--
it's
going
to
take
time.
it's
going
to
take
time
because
these
are
very
complex
matters.
this
is
not
just
divesting
a
bakery
or
a
shoe
manufacturer,
this
is
a
regulated
industry
where
before
you
can
recreate
the
new
company
you
have
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
federal
power
act
and
this
is
a
complicated
thing.
but,
the
important
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
obviously,
since
the
new
company
is
not
going
to
have
any
assets
to
speak
of
until
it's
divestiture
el
paso
will
have
to
finance
the
preparation
of
the
certificate
application
in
some.
but
as
i
say,
they
have
now
obtained
independent
counsel
they
were
obtained
by
the
new
management,
the
existing
management
of
the
new
company.
now
in
addition
to
that,
it
seems
to
me
there's
another
very
important
thing
which
is
cascades
particularly
talks
and
the
other
companies
talk
about
the
alleged
inadequacy
of
the
reserves
the
new
company.
but
before
the
federal
power
commission
will
grant
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
this
new
company,
it's
going
to
be
satisfied
that
the
reserves
meet
the
statutory
standard.
if
these
reserves
are
inadequate
this
federal
power
commission
is
not
going
to
certificate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
el
paso
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
then
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
it
would
then
--
the
burden
will
then
be
upon
the
new
company
to
get
some
additional
reserves.
and
in
this
case
they
have
to
then
go
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
new
companies?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
the
reserves,
all
the
reserves
that
el
paso
acquired
as
a
result
of
the
merger
are
being
turned
back.
in
addition
to
that,
el
paso
is
giving
the
new
company
some
reserves
in
the
rocky
mountain
area
that
el
paso
acquired.
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
the
acquisition.
in
addition
to
that,
el
paso
is
giving
the
new
company
a
gas
contract
for
canadian
gas
which
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
in
negotiation
but
had
not
yet
been
finally
determined.
the
fight
over
reserves
is
not
on
any
claim
that
el
paso
is
not
giving
back
to
the
new
company
everything
it's
got.
the
claim
is
that
the
new
company
should
get
something
more
than
it
should
get.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
claim
mr.
justice.
that
is
the
claim
and
then
let
me
explain
why
although
the
government
originally
espouse
that
position
after
further
study
of
it
retreated
from
it.
we
studied
the
thing
and
looking
back
to
the
situation
at
the
time
of
the
merger.
at
that
point
the
pacific
northwest
had
almost
signed
a
contract
for
this
large
supply
of
canadian
gas.
at
that
time
also,
pacific
northwest
was
unable
to
use
all
of
these
gas.
pacific
northwest
was
in
a
difficult
financial
position
at
that
point
it
was
doubtful
whether
it
would
have
the
funds
fully
to
develop
all
of
these
reserves
and
it
seem
to
us
there
was
a
very
serious
question.
in
the
light
of
this
whether
in
fact
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
pacific
northwest
would
have
acquired
these
reserves.
well
when
we
examines
this
and
the
record
indicates
we
talk
in
enormous
amounts
--
enormous
figures
of
course
when
we
deal
with
natural
gas.
they
are
turning
back,
giving
to
the
new
company
roughly
seven
and
a
half
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
by
way
of
reserves
which
is
1.7
trillion
more
than
pacific
northwest
had
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
come
back
for
a
minute
to
what
we
think
is
the
important
question
here
which
is
this
whole
question
of
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
settle
the
case
where
he
thinks
he's
federal
off
to
settle
the
case
than
to
fight
the
scene
to
litigation.
of
course
it's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
changed
it
mr.
justice,
all
i
can
tell
you
is
this,
we
changed
it
some
time
between
the
23rd
of
february
1965
which
is
one
of
the
proceedings
we
closed
in
district
court
and
the
24th
of
march,
i'm
sorry,
the
24th
of
may
roughly
three
months
later
when
we
filed
this
stipulation.
now,
let
me
explain
what
happened,
when
the
attorney
general
had
to
decide
at
this
point
whether
to
continue
to
press
further
for
litigation
or
to
accept
this
settlement
of
el
paso,
they
had
a
number
of
considerations
to
take
into
account.
first
of
all,
we
had
concluded
perhaps
we
in
error
but
it
was
our
conclusion
that
the
district
judge
had
evinced
great
sympathy
for
the
el
paso
plan.
and
we
were
concerned
that
if
we
continue
to
fight
this
thing,
a
probable
outcome
was
that
the
district
judge
would
adopt
the
el
paso
proposed
decree
which
of
course
far
less
favorable
from
our
point
of
view
than
the
decree
that
el
paso
ultimately
gave
us.
if
he
did
the
district
court
would
have
do
that
it
would
mean
one
or
two
things,
either
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
to
this
court
would
still
further
delay
in
accomplishing
prompt
divestiture
and
the
uncertainty
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
would
reverse
bearing
in
mind
the
district
court's
large
expression
or
just
leaving
the
case
there
with
a
lesser
decree
than
we
had
obtained.
in
addition
to
that,
the
parties,
el
paso
yielded
to
us
on
what
we
considered
to
be
the
most
serious
defect
in
the
plan.
that
is
the
failure
to
assure
complete
separation
of
the
new
company
in
el
paso.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
complete
separation,
that
is
the
separation
of
the
stock
interest
of
the
two
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
not
the
stock
separation
mr.
justice,
the
question,
this
court
has
decreed
that
there
was
to
be
divestiture
by
el
paso
of
pacific
northwest.
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
without
delay.
this
court
had
never
faced
the
question
whether
a
divestiture
by
which
el
paso
distributed
the
stock
of
pacific
northwest
to
its
stockholders
was
continued
a
controlling
relationship
so
significant
as
to
amount
to
a
failure
divested.
that's
the
point
on
which
they
had
ceded
to
us.
that's
the
point
on
which
they
ceded
to
us.
they
put
a
--
they
made
a
modification
in
the
decree
which
we
believed
protected
against
any
possibility
that
the
new
company
would
be
reluctant
to
complete
vigorously
against
el
paso
because
of
the
common
stock
ownership.
and
finally,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
in
examining
these
various
proposals
that
it
made
in
reexamining
our
opposition
quite
frankly,
we
concluded
that
there
was
some
more
equities
to
el
paso's
position
than
we
had
realized
and
perhaps
some
of
our
opposition
that
we
had
taken
in
the
district
court
upon
further
analysis
wouldn't
stand
up.
i
mean,
for
example
that
the
fact
of
the
amount
of
the
reserves,
the
very
substantial
$100
million
in
addition
to
the
el
paso
are
given.
and
it
seemed
to
us
on
balance,
on
balance
that
the
attorney
general
concluded
that
the
public
interest
in
achieving
prompt
divestiture
would
be
better
served
in
this
case
by
accepting
this
compromise
than
by
continuing
to
press
for
litigation
with
its
uncertainties
where
there's
a
possible
even
greater
to
life.
and
of
course,
this
is
the
kind
of
a
decision,
the
attorney
general
always
has
to
make
when
the
years
considering
whether
to
settle
the
case.
on
the
one
hand,
one
of
the
likelihood
of
getting
a
substantially
better
result
if
he
litigates;
two,
what
is
the
likely
hood
that
if
you
litigate
you
won't
do
as
well?
you
have
to
consider
particularly
in
this
case
the
time
situation
that
there
will
be
further
delays
if
he
pressed
the
matter
and
of
course
there
is
no
settlement
in
an
antitrust
case
that
satisfies
everybody.
someone
is
always
unhappy.
every
time
there's
a
settlement
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
a
not
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
claim
of
bad
faith
here.
the
only
claim
is
that
the
basically
the
claim
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
would
they
charge
mr.
--
they
charge
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
mr.
justice
we
think
that
even
after
this
court
has
decreed
divestiture,
the
government
and
the
other
side
have
the
authority
to
settle
a
case
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
we
--
the
court's
opinion
only
directed
to
divestiture
and
we
think
that
this
settlement
does
accomplish
divestiture.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
--
i
think
because
mr.
justice
in
the
whole
rubric
of
government
litigation
and
particularly
the
antitrust
litigation
even
after
a
judgment
of
this
court,
the
attorney
general
does
have
the
authority
to
settle
a
case
upon
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
mr.
justice
this
that
you
say
this
is
not
a
settlement,
this
is
not
a
settlement
in
a
sense
of
a
consent
judgment
where
the
case
is
settled
before
there
is
been
any
taking
of
testimony
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
after
the
finding
of
violation
has
been
established,
and
this
court
entered
decree
of
divested,
the
government
did
work
out
with
the
defendant,
did
settle
with
the
defendant
the
terms
and
the
extent
of
such
divestiture.
now,
divestiture
is
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
divestiture
means
divesting
the
property
acquired
and
i
try
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
there
have
been
such
divestiture.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
attempt
now
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no,
it
is
divest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
say
--
they
haven't
been
divested
enough.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
right
way.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
say
both.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
say
both
mr.
justice.
and
let
me
point
out
something
about
the
settlement
of
these
cases.
the
consent
judgment
of
course
as
this
court
insures,
whereas
a
very
important
tool
of
antitrust
enforcement.
our
statistics
show
that
roughly
70%
in
the
recent
years
of
all
antitrust
cases
have
been
settled.
this
is
because
of
the
fact
that
we
do
unfortunately
have
limited
resources.
we're
just
not
able
to
fight
every
case
to
the
full.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
but
--
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
if
we
have
but
we
have
mr.
justice
--
we
have
mr.
justice
settled
cases
after
the
district
court
has
found
violation.
we've
had
a
number
of
situations
we
cite
two
of
the
minority
briefs,
two
section
7
cases
in
which
after
the
district
court
have
found
violation
of
parties
then
work
out
a
settlement.
now,
i
am
sure
in
that
kind
of
a
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
two
it
seems
to
me
that
the
normal
remedy
is
divestiture.
and
i
think
in
those
cases
as
in
this
case
that
all
of
the
some
people
who
are
not
happy
with
the
terms
that
the
government's
decree.
and
it
seems
to
us
if
every
time
people
come
in
even
after
this
court
has
ordered
divestiture
and
say
to
the
district
court
they
don't
think
the
settlement
is
a
good
one.
they
think
the
government
should
settle
for
more
and
if
that's
enough
to
allow
them
to
intervene
mr.
justice,
i
suggest
it
would
be
conducive,
a
very
serious
delay.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
is
if
the
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
settled
on
terms
that
do
not
adequately
ensure
the
objective
of
the
suit
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that
claim
is
sufficient
it
seems
to
me,
i
don't
see
why
under
similar
reasoning,
people
couldn't
come
in
where
there
hasn't
been
a
decree
of
divesture
just
a
finding
of
violation
and
say
well
obviously
in
the
section
7
case,
divestiture
is
the
appropriate
remedy
on
a
price
fixing
case.
certain
type
of
injunctive
relief
is
the
appropriate
remedy
and
the
attorney
general
has
settled
for
less
than
that
particular
type
of
relief
and
it
seems
to
me
in
that
situation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no,
mr.
justice.
we're
not
trying
to
keep
from
having
the
facts
determined.
we
just
don't
think
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
people
who
are
claiming
that
the
government
isn't
adequately
performing
its
task
with
no
claim
of
malfeasance
and
impropriety.
people
just
in
effect
of
saying
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice
this
is
the
prerogative
of
the
attorney
general,
to
settle
a
government
antitrust
case
upon
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
if
--
suppose
--
i
don't
believe
the
attorney
general
--
there
might
be
a
reason
mr.
justice
why
a
particular
case
--
it
would
seem
--
it
would
seem
to
outsiders
that
the
case
have
been
given
away
yet
to
those
familiar,
to
those
making
the
policy
judgment
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
settle
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
these
--
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
the
seriousness
is
basically
the
claim
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
go
far
enough
in
this
case
when
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
they
don't
put
it
in
terms
of
a
complete
divestiture.
they
say,
he
didn't
provide
a
divestiture
that
would
ensure
that
the
new
company
would
be
reestablished
on
a
vigorous
independent
entity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
an
independent
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
not
be
an
effective
divestiture
perhaps.
now,
that
is
their
claim
and
our
answer
to
that
it
seems
to
me
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
that
it
seems
to
us
as
far
as
we're
concerned
we
think
this
judgment
does
provide
adequate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
i
of
course
would
have
to
concede
that
other
people
might
disagree
and
as
i
suggest
in
any
settlement,
in
any
settlement
that
they
disagree
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
all
i
can
say
to
that
mr.
justice
is
that
in
this
context,
the
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
agreed
to
less
than
a
complete
divestiture
we
don't
think
that's
enough,
that's
enough
to
bring
these
people
within
the
standard
of
the
rule
that
they
must
show
that
the
representation
of
their
interest
by
the
existing
parties
is
inadequate.
we
just
suggest
that
that's
repeatedly
been
held
that
adequacy
of
representation
in
this
context
requires
something
more
than
the
claim
that
the
case
was
settled
on
the
wrong
basis.
that
we
think
under
well
settled
practice
is
basically
the
function
of
the
attorney
general.
it's
within
his
discretion
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
my
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
--
this
is
their
contention
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
their
contention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
answer
is
that
the
attorney
general
did
take
these
facts
into
consideration
but
he
concluded
that
on
balance,
rather
than
try
to
press
for
a
stronger
decree
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
give
something
less
than
that
in
this
case.
to
accept
a
decree
which
corrected
what
we
thought
was
the
major
defect
in
where
the
other
contentions
which
we
had
pressed
upon
further
study
didn't
seem
to
us
to
call
for
further
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
i
would
suppose
as
a
matter
of
power,
he
could
do
that,
i
am
sure
he
wouldn't
do
that
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
--
he
could
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
decree
to
provide
no
divestiture.
we
think
this
decree
provides
very
substantial
divestiture
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it's
complete.
it's
complete
divestiture
in
terms
of
this
case,
yes.
we
as
the
--
as
our
representative
told
the
court,
we
think
this
decree
will
result
in
creating
a
new
independent
company
that
will
be
a
viable
effective
competitor
in
both
its
own
area
and
in
serving
the
california
area.
now
as
i
say
i
practically
concede
that
some
people
may
think
we
didn't
go
far
enough
this
is
true
in
any
case
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
failure
of
divestiture.
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
claim
at
all.
the
claim
basically
it
seems
to
me
is
basically
is
that
these
people
rather
than
the
attorney
general
should
have
the
final
decision
on
what
kind
of
a
decree
the
government
should
accept
in
termination
of
a
case
in
which
divestiture
was
would
and
we
think
basically
that
is
the
function
of
the
attorney
general
and
that
these
people
cannot
bring
themselves
within
the
rule
governing
intervention
by
claiming
that
the
attorney
general
made
a
mistake
or
didn't
do
an
adequate
job
on
the
basis
of
which
he
settled
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
that
in
turn
--
that
argument
in
turn
necessarily
means
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
authority
in
this
case
to
settle
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
he
would
have
no
authority
to
settle
because
if
these
people
were
intervenors
obviously
this
case
could
not
have
been
settled
on
this
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
of
course
not
mr.
justice
and
the
court
approved
this.
the
court
approved
this
settlement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
listened
to
them
--
objectives.
he
--
he
stated
before
the
final
decree
permitted
them
to
be
heard
and
some
of
them
were
heard.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
we
think
in
these
appeals
is
not
whether
this
decree
is
a
good
decree,
a
bad
decree,
whether
the
government
should
have
insisted
on
something
more.
we
think
the
question
here
is
basically
a
very
different
question
and
thus
more
important
question.
we
think
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
not
these
people
were
properly
denied
intervention
and
the
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
continental
situation,
we
think
was
a
very
different
question.
there
was
no
doubt
in
continental
that
the
case
was
properly
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
--
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
intervention
was
properly
denied
here.
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
to
dismiss
these
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
case
is
properly
here
to
consider
the
questions,
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
when
you
say
the
case
is
properly
here.
i
think
it
has
to
be
continental
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
problem
as
your
honor
indicated
whether
or
not
in
the
continental
situation,
the
court
could
consider
questions
going
beyond
the
assignments
of
error
and
the
court
said
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
well,
i
would
disagree
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
if
it
seems
that
this
is
as
charged
mr.
justice,
if
intervention
was
properly
denied
in
this
case,
if
these
appellants
were
properly
told,
they
had
no
interest
and
we're
not
in
this
case.
then
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
case
here
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
because
i
think
there's
no
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
not
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
the
parties
to
this
case
are
concerned
and
the
only
parties
thus
far
the
united
states
in
el
paso.
there
is
no
dispute
between
them.
they
have
settled
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
think
as
a
matter
of
power
the
court
would
have
that
power.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
because
of
the
complexities
of
this
problem.
if
the
court
should
hold
intervention
was
improperly
denied
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
consider
it.
but
our
point
is
that
alleged
to
reach
that
conclusion
unless
you
overcome
this
preliminary
hearing.
we
just
think
there's
no
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
a
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
a
very
cryptic
question.
it
appears
--
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
questions
that
bondholders
apparently
had
been
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
in
their
appeal.
now,
we
--
our
submission
here
today
is
if
the
district
court
properly
did
deny
intervention
under
the
applicable
standards
of
a
federal
rule
and
that
the
theory
upon
were
intervention
is
here
sought
and
a
theory
which
i
may
know
parenthetically
that
is
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
court's
consistently
have
rejected
would
have
very
grave
consequences
for
antitrust
enforcement
because
of
the
importance
of
the
consent
judgment
in
antitrust
procedures.
now,
the
critical
standards
are
set
forth
of
course
in
rule
24
which
is
set
forth
at
paragraph
3.
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
in
this
order.
first,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
contention
of
client
intervention
as
of
right
and
in
discussing,
i
can
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no
mr.
justice.
all
it
was
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
we
said
they
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
all
we
were
attempting
to
do
was
to
contrast
that
the
position
of
california
in
the
state
and
consulting
california
edison
which
would
have
been
standing
to
maintain
a
treble-damage
suit
with
the
standing
of
cascade
that
we
don't
believe
would
have
such
thing.
now,
i
shall
attempt
to
--
i
shall
discuss
this
first
in
terms
of
intervention
as
of
right
under
the
old
rule
because
that
is
we
think
the
rule
that
governed
and
then
i
will
turn
to
the
amendments
of
the
rule
and
explained
why
under
either
rule
we
don't
think
either
of
this
party
should
have
been
allowed
to
intervene.
and
secondly,
because
of
the
somewhat
different
position
apparently
taken
by
southern
california
edison
and
california
on
the
one
hand
as
people
who
are
interested
in
the
ability
of
the
new
company
to
compete
in
california
and
cascade
on
the
other
hand
which
seems
to
echo
that
argument,
they
also
suggest
the
possible
injury
to
itself
as
a
purchase
of
natural
gas
i
think
would
be
appropriate
to
take
up
these
two
considerations
separately.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
my
discussion
if
i
could
first
deal
with
the
question
of
intervention
and
when
i
get
into
the
question
intervention
and
touch
on
the
show
why
the
attorney
general's
representation
of
the
interest
involved
here
was
adequate
i
shall
take
up
and
discuss
the
various
attacks
that
have
been
made
upon
the
decree.
now,
let
me
first
turn
to
southern
california
edison
and
california's
claim
to
intervention
as
of
right.
as
the
rule
existed
before
its
amendment
last
summer,
the
two
possible
provisions
that
may
be
relevant
to
subparagraph
2
and
subparagraph
3.
subparagraph
2
permits
intervention
where
the
applicant
may
is
or
may
be
bound
by
the
judgment
and
were
the
representation
of
its
right
where
the
existing
party
is
inadequate.
i
will,
if
i
may
pass
for
the
minute
the
question,
the
adequacy
of
representation
which
i
will
discuss
under
the
new
rule.
but
let
me
come
to
the
question
of
bound.
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
under
this
court's
decision
of
the
sam
fox
case
a
few
terms
ago,
these
people
were
not
bound
by
this
judgment
because
the
teaching
of
sam
fox
says,
that
as
the
rule
uses
the
word
bound
means
bound
in
the
res
judicata
sense
and
that
you
are
not
bound
by
the
judgment,
even
though
the
practical
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
you
to
prevail
in
your
action.
indeed,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
revision
of
the
rule
was
a
recognition
by
the
revisers
that
it
was
rather
difficult
for
many
people
to
comply
with.
now,
the
other
sub
provision
of
the
rule
states
that
you
may
intervene
as
of
right
where
the
applicant
is
so
situated
to
be
adversely
affected
by
the
disposition
of
the
property
within
the
control
of
the
court.
now,
we
can
see
that
in
this
case
there
is
property
within
the
control
of
the
court
within
the
meaning
of
that
rule,
the
assets
to
be
divested.
but
here
we
think
their
argument
fails
because
they
don't
have
any
kind
of
interest
in
this
property
and
again,
it's
well
settled
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
standards
for
intervention
as
of
right
under
subsection
3
you've
got
to
have
some
kind
of
a
property
interest
in
the
property
under
control
of
the
court.
they
have
no
interest.
these
people
have
no
interest
in
the
assets
to
be
divested.
what
they
have
is
a
possible
course
of
action
against
the
el
paso
for
a
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
that
again
has
been
well
said
although
it's
not
enough.
now
the
amended
rule
which
was
effective
july
1,
1966
was
changed
to
eliminate
both
the
requirement
of
the
parties
be
bound
and
that
there
be
property
within
the
control
of
the
court.
the
rule
now
state
what
the
standards
that
there's
intervention
as
of
right
where
the
applicant
claims
an
interest
relating
to
the
property
or
transaction.
and
he
is
so
situated
at
the
disposition
of
the
action
may
as
a
practical
matter
impair
or
impede
feasibility
to
protect
that
but
this
rule
has
not
changed
the
requirement
that
but
he
also
must
show
that
he
was
--
interest
was
not
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
parties.
now
in
this
order
adopting
this
rule,
it
set
an
effect
the
court
set
in
effective
date
of
july
1,
1966
and
set
it
will
be
of
course
applicable
to
future
proceedings
and
in
addition
to
all
further
proceedings
in
actions
then
pending
unless
so
to
apply
would
result
would
work
in
justice.
now,
when
the
rule
speaks
of
further
proceedings,
it
seems
to
me
it
meant
proceedings
after
the
rule
was
adopted.
there
were
no
proceedings
in
the
district
court
after
this
rule
was
adopted.
indeed,
this
rule
was
adopted
approximately
six
months
after
this
court
had
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
pending
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
--
and
mr.
justice
i
also
point
out
that
this
court
of
course
is
reviewing
the
propriety
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
denying
intervention.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
as
appropriate
to
test
it
by
the
standards
which
were
in
existence
at
that
time.
and
also--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no
mr.
justice,
that's
about
i'm
coming
to
that
because
that's
my
very
next
point
that
even
assuming
the
amended
rule
does
apply
intervention
with
nevertheless
correctly
denied
because
as
i
have
mentioned
under
the
amended
rule
they
have
to
show
that
their
interest
was
not
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
parties.
now,
the
interest
that
california
or
in
southern
california
edison
are
seeking
to
assert
in
this
through
this
intervention
with
the
identical
interest
that
the
attorney
general
is
vindicating
that
is
the
correction
of
the
violations
and
the
restoration
of
pacific
northwest
as
an
effective
competitor
in
this
area.
and
we
think
that
both
as
a
matter
of
law
and
in
fact
the
attorney
general's
representation
of
that
interest
was
an
adequate
lone.
this
court
is
frequently
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
were
not
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
were
not
if
the
representation
was
not
adequate
then
we
would
say
they
have
made
a
case
for
intervention
that's
what
the
rule
says.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
well
first
let
me
just
say
that
as
i'll
come
to
a
moment,
we
don't
think
that
they
have
shown
that
this
is
inadequate
representation
in
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
--
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
because
this
goes
to
the
very
essence
of
the
settlement
process
that
this
goes
to
the
basic
question
that
seems
to
as
to
whether
the
attorney
general
can
be
charged
with
inadequately
representing
the
public
interest
because
he
settles
the
case
on
terms
that
people
who
may
be
effective
by
the
settlement
don't
think
it
was
adequate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
mr.
justice,
the
answer
is
that
under
our
adversary
system
of
litigation
the
basic
control
of
litigation
is
with
the
parties.
this
court
in
issuing
its
mandates
attempts
to
it
as
resolving
the
controversies
between
the
parties.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
to
be
--
there's
no
controversy
between
the
parties
anymore
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
that,
under
our
system
if
the
party
set
it's
controversy
there's
any
way
that
the
third
party
who
was
entered
thereby
can
challenge
that
except
by
doing
one
of
two
things
either
becoming
a
party
to
the
case
and
appealing
it
or
bringing
his
own
lawsuit.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
way
that
they
might
be
described
as
rowing
commissions
with
people
who
are
adversely
affected
by
decrees
which
they
don't
like
to
seek
judicial
review
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
when
you
say
properly
before
the
court,
i
think
for
him
to
be
here
properly
before
this
court
so
that
this
court
can
re-examine
the
question
of
compliance
that
that
requires
that
somehow
he'd
be
in
the
case
properly
and
we
think
these
people
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suppose,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
done
it
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
if
for
whatever
reasons
we
conclude
it
was
in
the
public
interest
we
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
our
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
is
that
under
our
system
they
cannot
be
heard
to
complain
that
the
government
is
settling
a
case
has
thrown
away
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
so
--
i
don't
think
this
court
unless
these
people
were
properly
parties
in
this
case
unless
they
were
entitled
to
get
into
this
case
when
the
court
speaks
of
a
case
being
properly
here,
i
think
that's
what
it
means.
someone
would
stand
to
challenge
the
judgment
below
has
brought
the
case
here
and
we
don't
think
these
people
have
standing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
say
mr.
justice
in
dealing
with
the
question,
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case
if
there
was
a
claim
of
bad
faith,
malfeasance,
nonfeasance,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
then
make
out
a
claim
for
intervention.
and
that
would
be
the
way
to
remedy
it
if
this
court
would
then
hold
that
they
have
been
improperly
denied
intervention.
if
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
with
all
due
respect
it
does
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
claim
is
that
the
government
is
acting
in
bad
faith
or
the
claim
is
only
that
the
attorney
general
made
a
mistake
in
settling
the
case
on
a
particular
term.
i'd
like
to
avert
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
sam
fox
case
where
it
said
that
sound
public
policy,
i'm
sorry,
sam
policy
would
strongly
lead
us
to
decline
appellants
invitation
to
asses
the
wisdom
of
the
court's
judgment
in
negotiating
and
accepting
the
1960
consent
decree
at
least
in
the
absence
of
any
claim
of
bad
faith
or
malfeasance
on
the
part
of
the
government.
now,
i
think
this
court
has
many
times
recognized
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
a
failure
to
perform
a
duty
in
this
sense
that
the
government
had
failed
to
take
into
consideration
certain
things.
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
a
claim
that
the
government
settled
the
case
on
two
narrow
terms.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
denied
that
of
course
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
say
we
don't
want
to
--
as
you
said
we
don't
want
to
get
to
that
point
because
we
think
they
haven't
made
a
sufficient
showing
on
the
basis
of
their
claim
to
entitle
them
to
intervene.
but
their
whole
claim
is
--
their
whole
claim
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
inadequately
represented
the
public.
now,
what
does
this
claim
rests
on?
this
claim
rests
on
the
contention
that
we
shouldn't
have
settled
the
case
on
these
terms,
we
should
have
asked
for
something
more
in
the
way
of
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
not
given
up
divestiture,
mr.
justice
black.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
mr.
justice
let
me
tell
it's
precisely
what
is
this
divestiture
decree
provides.
they
talk
about
giving
up
as
though
there
have
been
no
divestiture.
under
this
decree,
el
paso
gives
to
this
new
company
all
of
the
properties
that
it
originally
acquired
in
the
merger.
all
of
the
properties
plus
additions
and
improvements
to
those
properties
which
el
paso
made
during
the
period
they
had
controlled
the
property.
the
value
of
which
is
estimated
at
$100
million.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
token
divestiture.
this
is
a
very
complete
divestiture.
they
talked
about
the
gas
reserves.
their
complaint
about
the
gas
reserves
is
not
that
el
paso
is
keeping
any
of
the
reserves
it
got
from
pacific
northwest.
the
complaint
is
that
el
paso
is
not
giving
to
pacific
northwest
a
share
of
the
additional
reserves
that
el
paso
acquired
during
the
period
it
had
control
of
pacific
northwest.
the
record
shows
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
will
be
ultimately.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
will
be
ultimately.
du
pont
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
these
are
just
a
couple
of
quotations
i
think
that
he
was
referring
from
the
district
court
there
is
complete
divestiture.
let
me
explain
what
du
pont
thought.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe,
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it
is.
we
think
that
we've
given
back
everything
in
the
way
of
the
properties
to
which
they
are
entitled
and
there's
a
complete
severance
of
stock
control.
the
plan
is
originally
proposed
by
el
paso
which
the
government
objected.
the
principal
objection
we
had
to
that
plan
was
that
el
paso
proposed
to
distribute
the
stock
of
the
new
company
to
the
existing
el
paso
shareholders.
in
other
words,
what
el
paso
proposed
to
do
was
to
create
--
establish
a
new
company
and
i
might
mention
the
new
company
has
been
created
and
of
course
the
new
company
cannot
act
until
it
has
been
certificated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
new
company
has
been
created
and
the
federal
power
commission
proceedings
have
been
stayed
pending
the
determination
of
this
appeal.
el
paso
originally
proposed
to
turn
over
to
the
new
company
these
assets
to
take
the
stock
of
the
new
company
and
then
to
distribute
that
stock
with
certain
minor
exceptions
to
its
own
shareholders.
we
vigorously
opposed
this
because
we
said
this
would
not
ensure
a
separation
of
the
community
of
interest
between
the
two
companies.
since
they
advise
this
merger
as
this
court
held
in
its
previous
decision
was
that
it
for
the
possible
competition
of
pacific
northwest
to
serve
the
california
law,
we
didn't
think
it
would
be
a
fair
plan
under
which
any
strings
were
attached.
now,
there
were
lengthy
hearings
and
proceedings
in
this
case
the
record
here
of
the
divestiture
phase
occupies
by
printed
volumes
and
we
concede
that
during
the
course
of
those
proceedings,
we
oppose
a
plan
on
a
number
of
grounds.
after
the
record
was
closed,
we
studied
it
further.
and
el
paso
came
in
with
a
proposed
amended
plan
which
was
compromised.
el
paso
ceded
to
us
on
what
we
thought
was
a
principal
defect
of
a
plan
that
is
the
failure
to
ensure
separation
between
the
stockholders
of
the
new
and
the
old
company.
they
proposed
a
so-called
redding
decree,
named
after
the
old
redding
case.
under
which
the
stockholders
of
el
paso
wish
to
acquire
stock
of
the
new
company
would
have
to
give
up
their
el
paso
stock.
and
the
provision
is
that
80%
have
to
agree
to
this
for
tax
purposes
and
if
they're
unable
to
get
that
then
el
paso
would
undertake
to
sell
all
the
stock
of
the
new
company
to
--
through
a
public
offering.
in
addition
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
three
answers
to
that
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
at
the
insistence
of
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission,
the
new
company
has
now
retained
independent
counsel
to
represent
it
before
that
commission,
that's
the
first.
secondly,
the
department
of
justice
fully
considered
that
the
qualifications
of
the
new
principle
executive
offices
of
the
company,
mr.
clark,
the
new
chief
executive
officer
was
fully
examined
before
the
district
court
at
the
hearing
and
we
were
satisfied
that
he
is
a
completely
independent
man
and
he
was
asked
specifically
in
response
to
a
question
whether
when
the
company
is
established,
he
would
be
a
--
once
he
got
established
they
would
consider
competing
in
all
markets
including
california
and
he
said
yes.
so
that's
two
things.
third,
we
think
the
separation
of
the
stock
as
we
have
proposed
it
does
create
an
independent
entity.
this
is
a
company
that
is
--
will
be
free
from
the
control
of
el
paso.
now
it's
admittedly
--
it's
going
to
take
time.
it's
going
to
take
time
because
these
are
very
complex
matters.
this
is
not
just
divesting
a
bakery
or
a
shoe
manufacturer,
this
is
a
regulated
industry
where
before
you
can
recreate
the
new
company
you
have
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
federal
power
act
and
this
is
a
complicated
thing.
but,
the
important
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
obviously,
since
the
new
company
is
not
going
to
have
any
assets
to
speak
of
until
it's
divestiture
el
paso
will
have
to
finance
the
preparation
of
the
certificate
application
in
some.
but
as
i
say,
they
have
now
obtained
independent
counsel
they
were
obtained
by
the
new
management,
the
existing
management
of
the
new
company.
now
in
addition
to
that,
it
seems
to
me
there's
another
very
important
thing
which
is
cascades
particularly
talks
and
the
other
companies
talk
about
the
alleged
inadequacy
of
the
reserves
the
new
company.
but
before
the
federal
power
commission
will
grant
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
this
new
company,
it's
going
to
be
satisfied
that
the
reserves
meet
the
statutory
standard.
if
these
reserves
are
inadequate
this
federal
power
commission
is
not
going
to
certificate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
el
paso
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
then
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
it
would
then
--
the
burden
will
then
be
upon
the
new
company
to
get
some
additional
reserves.
and
in
this
case
they
have
to
then
go
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
new
companies?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
the
reserves,
all
the
reserves
that
el
paso
acquired
as
a
result
of
the
merger
are
being
turned
back.
in
addition
to
that,
el
paso
is
giving
the
new
company
some
reserves
in
the
rocky
mountain
area
that
el
paso
acquired.
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
the
acquisition.
in
addition
to
that,
el
paso
is
giving
the
new
company
a
gas
contract
for
canadian
gas
which
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
in
negotiation
but
had
not
yet
been
finally
determined.
the
fight
over
reserves
is
not
on
any
claim
that
el
paso
is
not
giving
back
to
the
new
company
everything
it's
got.
the
claim
is
that
the
new
company
should
get
something
more
than
it
should
get.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
claim
mr.
justice.
that
is
the
claim
and
then
let
me
explain
why
although
the
government
originally
espouse
that
position
after
further
study
of
it
retreated
from
it.
we
studied
the
thing
and
looking
back
to
the
situation
at
the
time
of
the
merger.
at
that
point
the
pacific
northwest
had
almost
signed
a
contract
for
this
large
supply
of
canadian
gas.
at
that
time
also,
pacific
northwest
was
unable
to
use
all
of
these
gas.
pacific
northwest
was
in
a
difficult
financial
position
at
that
point
it
was
doubtful
whether
it
would
have
the
funds
fully
to
develop
all
of
these
reserves
and
it
seem
to
us
there
was
a
very
serious
question.
in
the
light
of
this
whether
in
fact
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
pacific
northwest
would
have
acquired
these
reserves.
well
when
we
examines
this
and
the
record
indicates
we
talk
in
enormous
amounts
--
enormous
figures
of
course
when
we
deal
with
natural
gas.
they
are
turning
back,
giving
to
the
new
company
roughly
seven
and
a
half
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
by
way
of
reserves
which
is
1.7
trillion
more
than
pacific
northwest
had
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
come
back
for
a
minute
to
what
we
think
is
the
important
question
here
which
is
this
whole
question
of
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
settle
the
case
where
he
thinks
he's
federal
off
to
settle
the
case
than
to
fight
the
scene
to
litigation.
of
course
it's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
changed
it
mr.
justice,
all
i
can
tell
you
is
this,
we
changed
it
some
time
between
the
23rd
of
february
1965
which
is
one
of
the
proceedings
we
closed
in
district
court
and
the
24th
of
march,
i'm
sorry,
the
24th
of
may
roughly
three
months
later
when
we
filed
this
stipulation.
now,
let
me
explain
what
happened,
when
the
attorney
general
had
to
decide
at
this
point
whether
to
continue
to
press
further
for
litigation
or
to
accept
this
settlement
of
el
paso,
they
had
a
number
of
considerations
to
take
into
account.
first
of
all,
we
had
concluded
perhaps
we
in
error
but
it
was
our
conclusion
that
the
district
judge
had
evinced
great
sympathy
for
the
el
paso
plan.
and
we
were
concerned
that
if
we
continue
to
fight
this
thing,
a
probable
outcome
was
that
the
district
judge
would
adopt
the
el
paso
proposed
decree
which
of
course
far
less
favorable
from
our
point
of
view
than
the
decree
that
el
paso
ultimately
gave
us.
if
he
did
the
district
court
would
have
do
that
it
would
mean
one
or
two
things,
either
the
possibility
of
an
appeal
to
this
court
would
still
further
delay
in
accomplishing
prompt
divestiture
and
the
uncertainty
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
would
reverse
bearing
in
mind
the
district
court's
large
expression
or
just
leaving
the
case
there
with
a
lesser
decree
than
we
had
obtained.
in
addition
to
that,
the
parties,
el
paso
yielded
to
us
on
what
we
considered
to
be
the
most
serious
defect
in
the
plan.
that
is
the
failure
to
assure
complete
separation
of
the
new
company
in
el
paso.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
complete
separation,
that
is
the
separation
of
the
stock
interest
of
the
two
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
not
the
stock
separation
mr.
justice,
the
question,
this
court
has
decreed
that
there
was
to
be
divestiture
by
el
paso
of
pacific
northwest.
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
without
delay.
this
court
had
never
faced
the
question
whether
a
divestiture
by
which
el
paso
distributed
the
stock
of
pacific
northwest
to
its
stockholders
was
continued
a
controlling
relationship
so
significant
as
to
amount
to
a
failure
divested.
that's
the
point
on
which
they
had
ceded
to
us.
that's
the
point
on
which
they
ceded
to
us.
they
put
a
--
they
made
a
modification
in
the
decree
which
we
believed
protected
against
any
possibility
that
the
new
company
would
be
reluctant
to
complete
vigorously
against
el
paso
because
of
the
common
stock
ownership.
and
finally,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
in
examining
these
various
proposals
that
it
made
in
reexamining
our
opposition
quite
frankly,
we
concluded
that
there
was
some
more
equities
to
el
paso's
position
than
we
had
realized
and
perhaps
some
of
our
opposition
that
we
had
taken
in
the
district
court
upon
further
analysis
wouldn't
stand
up.
i
mean,
for
example
that
the
fact
of
the
amount
of
the
reserves,
the
very
substantial
$100
million
in
addition
to
the
el
paso
are
given.
and
it
seemed
to
us
on
balance,
on
balance
that
the
attorney
general
concluded
that
the
public
interest
in
achieving
prompt
divestiture
would
be
better
served
in
this
case
by
accepting
this
compromise
than
by
continuing
to
press
for
litigation
with
its
uncertainties
where
there's
a
possible
even
greater
to
life.
and
of
course,
this
is
the
kind
of
a
decision,
the
attorney
general
always
has
to
make
when
the
years
considering
whether
to
settle
the
case.
on
the
one
hand,
one
of
the
likelihood
of
getting
a
substantially
better
result
if
he
litigates;
two,
what
is
the
likely
hood
that
if
you
litigate
you
won't
do
as
well?
you
have
to
consider
particularly
in
this
case
the
time
situation
that
there
will
be
further
delays
if
he
pressed
the
matter
and
of
course
there
is
no
settlement
in
an
antitrust
case
that
satisfies
everybody.
someone
is
always
unhappy.
every
time
there's
a
settlement
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
a
not
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
claim
of
bad
faith
here.
the
only
claim
is
that
the
basically
the
claim
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
would
they
charge
mr.
--
they
charge
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
mr.
justice
we
think
that
even
after
this
court
has
decreed
divestiture,
the
government
and
the
other
side
have
the
authority
to
settle
a
case
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
we
--
the
court's
opinion
only
directed
to
divestiture
and
we
think
that
this
settlement
does
accomplish
divestiture.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
--
i
think
because
mr.
justice
in
the
whole
rubric
of
government
litigation
and
particularly
the
antitrust
litigation
even
after
a
judgment
of
this
court,
the
attorney
general
does
have
the
authority
to
settle
a
case
upon
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
mr.
justice
this
that
you
say
this
is
not
a
settlement,
this
is
not
a
settlement
in
a
sense
of
a
consent
judgment
where
the
case
is
settled
before
there
is
been
any
taking
of
testimony
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
after
the
finding
of
violation
has
been
established,
and
this
court
entered
decree
of
divested,
the
government
did
work
out
with
the
defendant,
did
settle
with
the
defendant
the
terms
and
the
extent
of
such
divestiture.
now,
divestiture
is
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
divestiture
means
divesting
the
property
acquired
and
i
try
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
there
have
been
such
divestiture.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
attempt
now
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no,
it
is
divest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
say
--
they
haven't
been
divested
enough.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
right
way.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
say
both.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
say
both
mr.
justice.
and
let
me
point
out
something
about
the
settlement
of
these
cases.
the
consent
judgment
of
course
as
this
court
insures,
whereas
a
very
important
tool
of
antitrust
enforcement.
our
statistics
show
that
roughly
70%
in
the
recent
years
of
all
antitrust
cases
have
been
settled.
this
is
because
of
the
fact
that
we
do
unfortunately
have
limited
resources.
we're
just
not
able
to
fight
every
case
to
the
full.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
but
--
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
if
we
have
but
we
have
mr.
justice
--
we
have
mr.
justice
settled
cases
after
the
district
court
has
found
violation.
we've
had
a
number
of
situations
we
cite
two
of
the
minority
briefs,
two
section
7
cases
in
which
after
the
district
court
have
found
violation
of
parties
then
work
out
a
settlement.
now,
i
am
sure
in
that
kind
of
a
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
two
it
seems
to
me
that
the
normal
remedy
is
divestiture.
and
i
think
in
those
cases
as
in
this
case
that
all
of
the
some
people
who
are
not
happy
with
the
terms
that
the
government's
decree.
and
it
seems
to
us
if
every
time
people
come
in
even
after
this
court
has
ordered
divestiture
and
say
to
the
district
court
they
don't
think
the
settlement
is
a
good
one.
they
think
the
government
should
settle
for
more
and
if
that's
enough
to
allow
them
to
intervene
mr.
justice,
i
suggest
it
would
be
conducive,
a
very
serious
delay.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
is
if
the
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
settled
on
terms
that
do
not
adequately
ensure
the
objective
of
the
suit
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that
claim
is
sufficient
it
seems
to
me,
i
don't
see
why
under
similar
reasoning,
people
couldn't
come
in
where
there
hasn't
been
a
decree
of
divesture
just
a
finding
of
violation
and
say
well
obviously
in
the
section
7
case,
divestiture
is
the
appropriate
remedy
on
a
price
fixing
case.
certain
type
of
injunctive
relief
is
the
appropriate
remedy
and
the
attorney
general
has
settled
for
less
than
that
particular
type
of
relief
and
it
seems
to
me
in
that
situation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no,
mr.
justice.
we're
not
trying
to
keep
from
having
the
facts
determined.
we
just
don't
think
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
people
who
are
claiming
that
the
government
isn't
adequately
performing
its
task
with
no
claim
of
malfeasance
and
impropriety.
people
just
in
effect
of
saying
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice
this
is
the
prerogative
of
the
attorney
general,
to
settle
a
government
antitrust
case
upon
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
if
--
suppose
--
i
don't
believe
the
attorney
general
--
there
might
be
a
reason
mr.
justice
why
a
particular
case
--
it
would
seem
--
it
would
seem
to
outsiders
that
the
case
have
been
given
away
yet
to
those
familiar,
to
those
making
the
policy
judgment
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
settle
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
these
--
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
the
seriousness
is
basically
the
claim
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
go
far
enough
in
this
case
when
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
they
don't
put
it
in
terms
of
a
complete
divestiture.
they
say,
he
didn't
provide
a
divestiture
that
would
ensure
that
the
new
company
would
be
reestablished
on
a
vigorous
independent
entity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
an
independent
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
not
be
an
effective
divestiture
perhaps.
now,
that
is
their
claim
and
our
answer
to
that
it
seems
to
me
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
that
it
seems
to
us
as
far
as
we're
concerned
we
think
this
judgment
does
provide
adequate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
i
of
course
would
have
to
concede
that
other
people
might
disagree
and
as
i
suggest
in
any
settlement,
in
any
settlement
that
they
disagree
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
all
i
can
say
to
that
mr.
justice
is
that
in
this
context,
the
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
agreed
to
less
than
a
complete
divestiture
we
don't
think
that's
enough,
that's
enough
to
bring
these
people
within
the
standard
of
the
rule
that
they
must
show
that
the
representation
of
their
interest
by
the
existing
parties
is
inadequate.
we
just
suggest
that
that's
repeatedly
been
held
that
adequacy
of
representation
in
this
context
requires
something
more
than
the
claim
that
the
case
was
settled
on
the
wrong
basis.
that
we
think
under
well
settled
practice
is
basically
the
function
of
the
attorney
general.
it's
within
his
discretion
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
my
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
--
this
is
their
contention
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
their
contention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
answer
is
that
the
attorney
general
did
take
these
facts
into
consideration
but
he
concluded
that
on
balance,
rather
than
try
to
press
for
a
stronger
decree
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
give
something
less
than
that
in
this
case.
to
accept
a
decree
which
corrected
what
we
thought
was
the
major
defect
in
where
the
other
contentions
which
we
had
pressed
upon
further
study
didn't
seem
to
us
to
call
for
further
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
i
would
suppose
as
a
matter
of
power,
he
could
do
that,
i
am
sure
he
wouldn't
do
that
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
--
he
could
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
decree
to
provide
no
divestiture.
we
think
this
decree
provides
very
substantial
divestiture
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it's
complete.
it's
complete
divestiture
in
terms
of
this
case,
yes.
we
as
the
--
as
our
representative
told
the
court,
we
think
this
decree
will
result
in
creating
a
new
independent
company
that
will
be
a
viable
effective
competitor
in
both
its
own
area
and
in
serving
the
california
area.
now
as
i
say
i
practically
concede
that
some
people
may
think
we
didn't
go
far
enough
this
is
true
in
any
case
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
failure
of
divestiture.
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
claim
at
all.
the
claim
basically
it
seems
to
me
is
basically
is
that
these
people
rather
than
the
attorney
general
should
have
the
final
decision
on
what
kind
of
a
decree
the
government
should
accept
in
termination
of
a
case
in
which
divestiture
was
would
and
we
think
basically
that
is
the
function
of
the
attorney
general
and
that
these
people
cannot
bring
themselves
within
the
rule
governing
intervention
by
claiming
that
the
attorney
general
made
a
mistake
or
didn't
do
an
adequate
job
on
the
basis
of
which
he
settled
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
that
in
turn
--
that
argument
in
turn
necessarily
means
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
authority
in
this
case
to
settle
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
he
would
have
no
authority
to
settle
because
if
these
people
were
intervenors
obviously
this
case
could
not
have
been
settled
on
this
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
of
course
not
mr.
justice
and
the
court
approved
this.
the
court
approved
this
settlement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
listened
to
them
--
objectives.
he
--
he
stated
before
the
final
decree
permitted
them
to
be
heard
and
some
of
them
were
heard.
thank
you,
your
honor.
