of

in
the
du

case,
united

is
not
satisfied
with
what
they're
doing
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
wondering.
notwithstanding,
we
entered
the
mandate
as
you
did
that
you
said,
you
don't
think
the
united
states
could
give
up
the
whole
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
are
you
--
are
you
in
the
case
of
intervenor?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
to
cite
that
question
before
we
reach
the
question
you
now
argue?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
entitled
to
become
a
party
of
this
lawsuit
so
that
it
is
not
entirely
the
government
could
control.
justice

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
make
this
argument
if
instead
of
noting
the
problem
with
jurisdiction
we
have
postponed?
suppose
our
action
in
bringing
it
here
have
been
postponed
jurisdiction
instead
of
noting
it.
would
you
make
a
different
argument,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
we
--
said
we'll
hear
you
one
of
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
answer
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
to
this
$45
million,
would
you
suggest
if
you
did
follow?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
some
benefits
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
mr.
friedman,
we
take
your
view
that
we
have
to
first
to
decide
that
they
should
whether
they
should
been
allowed
to
intervene.
now
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
as
to
one
of
our
--
anyone
of
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
then
what's
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
we
decide
that
it
should
have
intervened,
may
we
then
under
the
continental
in
our
motion
to
say,
well,
the
government
had
no
right
in
light
of
our
mandate
makes
the
deal
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
--
any
question
of
intervention
raised
in
the
continental
principle?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
read
the
opinion.
it
appears
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
they
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
contest
--
well,
excuse
me
mr.
friedman.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
if
that
so,
there's
somebody
--
if
we
decide
somebody
should
have
been
allowed
in
and
we
may
do
then
as
you
said
as
a
matter
of
power.
at
page
57,
that's
the
significance
of
this
sentence
in
the
brief,
edison,
at
least
edison
not
california
cascade
as
a
purchaser
of
natural
gas
in
the
california
market
well
and
you
have
and
the
state
of
california
as
a
representative
of
such
a
person
have
standing
the
challenge
of
restraint
upon
competition
in
that
market
is
that
a
concession
that
they
should
have
allowed
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
friedman,
if
there've
been
divestiture
that
the
du
pont
sends,
there's
not
been
that
here
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
enough
for
the
record
but
i
thought
mr.
bennett
told
us
that
they
can't
be
ultimately.
i
gather
he
said
there's
something
deadly
about
strings
on
management,
strings
on
markets
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
this
--
why
isn't
this
complete
as
it
was
in
the
du
pont
sense?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
do
think
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
something
you
said
about
the
el
paso
financing
on
these
operations
at
this
time.
how
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
it
--
but
el
paso
has
enough
reserves
that
what
the
new
companies
will
gather
inadequate
that
is
el
paso
required
to
provide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
commission
decides
finally
that
the
inadequate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
there
something
--
did
you
say
there's
something
about
these
reserves
which
el
paso
applied
by
reason
of
its
acquisition
of
the
companies?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
acquired
after
the
acquisition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
suggestion
that
if
the
acquisition
had
not
occurred,
the
reserves
to
el
paso
since
acquired
might
have
been
acquired
by
the
acquired
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harrison,
by
opposing
do
you
refer
to
that
$45
million
that
the
attorney
general's
argument
is
talking
about?
do
you
retain
oppose
it,
i
am
not
quite
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
then
does
the
$45
million
item
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
woodbury
are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
was
divested,
i'm
hearing
a
lot
of
things
that
are
being
divested,
now
what's
left
for
el
paso?
justice
byron
r.
white
permitted
by
present
demand
as
today's
demand
that
the
congress
to
this
reports?
so
they
have
certain
reserves
time
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
as
of
today?
but
what
the
status
quo
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
there
had
1.95
times
the
canadian
reserve
at
the
time
of
merger.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
in
the
san
juan
basin.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
this
present
plan
leaves
them
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
one
third
is
relative
to
the
increase
demand
for
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
put
pacific
northwest
where
it
would
be
today
if
the

had
never
