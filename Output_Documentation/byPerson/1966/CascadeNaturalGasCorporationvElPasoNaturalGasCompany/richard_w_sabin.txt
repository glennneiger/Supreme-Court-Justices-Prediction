mr.
richard
w.
sabin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
before
the
court
today
as
amicus
curiae
we've
already
filed
the
brief.
that
brief
contains
what
we
believe
to
be
a
statement
of
the
equities
involved
in
the
lower
court
decree
which
amicus
before
you
today
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
yes,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
what
course
of
action
the
court
might
have
follow
in
order
to
finally
dispose
of
the
litigation
which
is
before
you.
as
you
all
i'm
sure
this
court
is
now
before
you
for
the
--
this
case
is
now
before
you
for
the
third
time.
criminal
consumer
interest
standpoint
as
well
as
to
comply
with
the
mandate
of
this
court
issued
in
the
last
time
around.
we
deemed
it
essential
that
this
matter
be
finally
resolved.
in
our
brief,
we
suggested
that
a
master
to
be
appointed.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
even
withdraw
that
suggestion
since
it
would
appear
if
a
master
is
appointed.
he
would
have
to
report
somebody
in
further
extend
the
duration
of
this
case.
and
as
i
say
it
is
not
our
view
that
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
consumers
pacific
northwest.
it
is
our
view
that
to
effectuate
the
final
decree
you
got
to
do
it
yourselves,
you
got
to
provide
firmly
and
finally
directions
to
the
lower
court
as
to
what
shall
be
done.
we
think
the
first
step
is
the
creation
of
a
new
amnesty.
now
i
don't,
at
this
point
wished
to
write-off
the
existing
entity
provided
for
by
the
decree
of
the
lower
court
as
a
potential
success
or
an
interest.
however,
in
the
method
of
divestiture
provided
by
the
lower
court
does
not
in
our
opinion
provide
the
creation
of
an
independent
entity
within
the
contemplation
of
the
court's
prior
opinion.
in
other
words,
we
don't
believe
that
is
it
what
you
contemplate,
it
may
be
satisfactory
for
our
needs
but
not
for
the
needs
of
the
mandate.
mr.
bennett
is
concern
with
the
--
of
will
and
ability
to
compete.
we
are
not
as
much
concerned
with
the
will
to
compete
up
in
oregon
as
we
are
ability
because
it
has
the
ability
to
compete,
it
has
the
ability
to
serve
its
own
markets
which
is
now
serving
and
that's
us.
now,
there
is
one
suggestion
that
the
lower
court
made
of
record
it's
at
page
1,222
and
that
suggestion
is
that
an
adversary
party
to
el
paso
should
be
created
which
could
be
heard
in
the
lower
court.
that
suggestion
has
great
merit
in
our
view
since
if
adversary
appears
in
the
court
which
is
capable
financially
of
examining
into
these
asset
questions.
you
should
then
be
able
to
have
reasonable
resolution
of
fair
and
equitable
distribution
of
the
assets
between
the
two
companies.
that
makes
the
divestiture
help
you.
the
next
case
of
the
decree
which
we
have
urged
upon
you
is
to
accept
that
division
of
debt
which
is
proposed
by
our
el
paso.
that
means
a
$180
million
worth
of
long-term
debt
would
be
absorbed
by
the
new
company.
but
to
reject
without
qualification,
the
provisions
suggested
or
contained
in
the
lower
court
decree
that
this
new
entity
which
is
to
succeed
to
the
assets
pay
an
extra
or
premium
price
on
those
bonds.
in
other
words,
they
intend
to
raise
the
interest
rates
on
those
bonds.
i
see
no
justification
for
that
and
it's
definitely
at
the
expense
of
the
consumers
who
did
not
consummate
this
merger.
the
next
step
would
be
the
specific
division
of
assets.
now
that's
the
third
part
that
is
largely
covered
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
you
should
spell
it
out
just
as
we
have,
just
as
other
appellants
have
in
briefs.
so
there
can
be
no
mistake
in
the
lower
court.
what
you're
talking
about
is
apparently
there
was
last
time.
this
would
include
not
only
division
of
assets
but
we're
estimating
pre-merger
in
their
corporate
dealings
between
the
two
corporations.
there
were
two
of
them
in
particular
which
are
concerned
to
us.
one
of
them
is
simple
to
orderly
start
that's
the
king's
gate
gas
proposition.
here
there
is
the
assumed
as
common
gathering
systems
as
it
now
exist
must
be
divided.
now,
that
division
because
of
the
dispute
in
the
court
should
be
prescribed
specifically
to
include
change
in
the
contract
as
it
was
part
of
the
merger
to
incorporate
all
pre
or
post
merger
additions
and
extensions
of
the
common
gathering
system.
now,
if
a
new
company
is
created
which
becomes
an
adversary
in
the
lower
court,
if
you
accept
that
premise,
then
it
will
be
necessary
also
to
lay
down
to
definite
guidelines
for
the
court,
the
lower
court.
in
--
in
our
view,
there
can
be
only
one
rational
rule
of
distribution
of
assets
and
that's
restoration
of
the
pre-merger
status
quo,
alright.
it
was
found
by
you
that
the
merger
destroyed
competition.
if
anything
less
than
pre-merger
status
quo
is
now
created.
there
can
be
hardly
be
competition
of
this
--
at
the
same
level
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
merger.
another
general
rule
which
we
advocate
here
and
i
can
not
really
say
that
there's
any
precedent.
there
may
be
some
direction
but
there
are
no
cases
on
this.
and
that
is
the
principle
that
no
wrongdoer
should
be
allowed
to
profit
from
his
own
wrong.
now
this
means,
if
you
give
full
effect
to
any
simple
concept
if
you
use
it,
you
have
use
it
in
a
du
pont
but
i
intend
it
abrogating
extension
of
it
to
see
that
el
paso
in
selling
the
assets
and
the
--
that's
what
will
abrogate
the
sale
of
assets.
in
selling
them,
it
should
have
no
pecuniary
gain
from
the
profit.
this
rule
is
i
say
is
without
precedent,
although,
i
think
you
can
find
trends
in
that
direction
in
your
case.
however
if
implemented,
it
means
that
mergers
or
a
merger
applicants
or
those
who
contemplate
merger
from
this
day
forward
will
have
to
look
nor
how
much
they
can
gain
even
if
they
got
caught
but
whether
not
only
will
they
be
deprived
of
the
property
acquired
by
merger
but
also
of
the
profits
which
they
have
gained
during
the
course
of
the
merger.
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
capital
gains.
i
think
the
current
value
for
tax
part
--
purposes
of
the
el
paso
properties
to
be
the
best
is
to
according
to
the
el
paso
exhibit
in
the
lower
court
is
a
$187
million.
the
book
value
of
the
equity
portion
not
after
allowance
for
$180
million
of
bonds
is
$63
million.
the
market
value
according
to
the
transcript,
i'm
sorry
i
lost
the
page,
but
the
transcript
indicates
the
market
value
currently
is
a
$107
million.
now
that
means
there's
approximately
$43
or
$45
million
of
profit,
just
based
on
the
book.
let
alone
for
tax
purposes
which
el
paso
will
have
to
arrive
by
reason
of
its
wrongdoing.
we
urge
that
when
you
provide,
if
you're
willing
to
provide
for
sale
of
these
assets.
the
el
paso
not
be
permitted
to
reach
those
ill-gotten
gains.
this
will
give
long
term
protection
to
the
consumers
not
only
in
oregon
but
throughout
the
nation.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
as
amicus,
i
think
i'm
agree
--
entitled
to
agree
with
the
other
side
everything
on
it.
the
other
side
seems
divided.
oregon
is
in
full
to
support
of
the
el
paso
contention
of
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction.
once
you
have
ordered
of
the
divestiture
and
prescribe
the
terms
of
it
or
proved
the
terms
as
the
case
may
be
their
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdictions
to
alter
those
terms.
it
must
issue
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
in
accordance
of
the
terms
of
decree.
thereafter,
it
can
be
free
to
look
into
under
corporate
dealings,
prices,
rates,
whatever.
so,
we
cannot
at
this
stage,
let
for
protection
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
this
is
another
reason
why
we
think
that
you
must
protect
this.
we
can't
let
the
federal
power
commission.
the
government
takes
an
opposite
view
in
its
brief.
and
perhaps
others
will
take
opposite
views
if
the
matter
does
reach
the
federal
power
commission
without
a
definitive
statement
by
this
court
on
that
question.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
if
you
follow
the
plan
i'm
advocating.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
in
effect
would
depend
upon
the
manner
of
sale
of
the
assets.
if
you
had
a
stock
sale
in
effect,
it
would
work
as
a
premium
on
the
sale
stock
by
a
new
company.
in
other
words,
the
stock
of
the
new
company
placed
on
the
market
would
be
valued
at
approximately
a
$107
million
according
to
record
is
probably
substantially
more
than
that
now.
the
book
equity
is
$63
million
and
so
the
purchaser
on
the
market
will
have
paid
in
the
full
value
to
the
corporation
and
the
corporate
treasury
will
reflect
then,
i
would
presume
in
accounting
they
call
it
paid-in
surplus
for
the
difference
between
the
book
value
of
$63
million
and
the
dollars
received
a
$107
million
--
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
it's
an
indirect
benefit
but
there
is
one.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
well,
you
have
a
financially
strong
pipeline
company
as
the
immediate
benefit.
the
secondary
method
is
the
not
only
capability
of
striking
facilities
and
so
on
but
the
warrant
of
immediate
upward
pressure
on
rates.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
before
the
court
today
as
amicus
curiae
we've
already
filed
the
brief.
that
brief
contains
what
we
believe
to
be
a
statement
of
the
equities
involved
in
the
lower
court
decree
which
amicus
before
you
today
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
yes,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
what
course
of
action
the
court
might
have
follow
in
order
to
finally
dispose
of
the
litigation
which
is
before
you.
as
you
all
i'm
sure
this
court
is
now
before
you
for
the
--
this
case
is
now
before
you
for
the
third
time.
criminal
consumer
interest
standpoint
as
well
as
to
comply
with
the
mandate
of
this
court
issued
in
the
last
time
around.
we
deemed
it
essential
that
this
matter
be
finally
resolved.
in
our
brief,
we
suggested
that
a
master
to
be
appointed.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
even
withdraw
that
suggestion
since
it
would
appear
if
a
master
is
appointed.
he
would
have
to
report
somebody
in
further
extend
the
duration
of
this
case.
and
as
i
say
it
is
not
our
view
that
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
consumers
pacific
northwest.
it
is
our
view
that
to
effectuate
the
final
decree
you
got
to
do
it
yourselves,
you
got
to
provide
firmly
and
finally
directions
to
the
lower
court
as
to
what
shall
be
done.
we
think
the
first
step
is
the
creation
of
a
new
amnesty.
now
i
don't,
at
this
point
wished
to
write-off
the
existing
entity
provided
for
by
the
decree
of
the
lower
court
as
a
potential
success
or
an
interest.
however,
in
the
method
of
divestiture
provided
by
the
lower
court
does
not
in
our
opinion
provide
the
creation
of
an
independent
entity
within
the
contemplation
of
the
court's
prior
opinion.
in
other
words,
we
don't
believe
that
is
it
what
you
contemplate,
it
may
be
satisfactory
for
our
needs
but
not
for
the
needs
of
the
mandate.
mr.
bennett
is
concern
with
the
--
of
will
and
ability
to
compete.
we
are
not
as
much
concerned
with
the
will
to
compete
up
in
oregon
as
we
are
ability
because
it
has
the
ability
to
compete,
it
has
the
ability
to
serve
its
own
markets
which
is
now
serving
and
that's
us.
now,
there
is
one
suggestion
that
the
lower
court
made
of
record
it's
at
page
1,222
and
that
suggestion
is
that
an
adversary
party
to
el
paso
should
be
created
which
could
be
heard
in
the
lower
court.
that
suggestion
has
great
merit
in
our
view
since
if
adversary
appears
in
the
court
which
is
capable
financially
of
examining
into
these
asset
questions.
you
should
then
be
able
to
have
reasonable
resolution
of
fair
and
equitable
distribution
of
the
assets
between
the
two
companies.
that
makes
the
divestiture
help
you.
the
next
case
of
the
decree
which
we
have
urged
upon
you
is
to
accept
that
division
of
debt
which
is
proposed
by
our
el
paso.
that
means
a
$180
million
worth
of
long-term
debt
would
be
absorbed
by
the
new
company.
but
to
reject
without
qualification,
the
provisions
suggested
or
contained
in
the
lower
court
decree
that
this
new
entity
which
is
to
succeed
to
the
assets
pay
an
extra
or
premium
price
on
those
bonds.
in
other
words,
they
intend
to
raise
the
interest
rates
on
those
bonds.
i
see
no
justification
for
that
and
it's
definitely
at
the
expense
of
the
consumers
who
did
not
consummate
this
merger.
the
next
step
would
be
the
specific
division
of
assets.
now
that's
the
third
part
that
is
largely
covered
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
you
should
spell
it
out
just
as
we
have,
just
as
other
appellants
have
in
briefs.
so
there
can
be
no
mistake
in
the
lower
court.
what
you're
talking
about
is
apparently
there
was
last
time.
this
would
include
not
only
division
of
assets
but
we're
estimating
pre-merger
in
their
corporate
dealings
between
the
two
corporations.
there
were
two
of
them
in
particular
which
are
concerned
to
us.
one
of
them
is
simple
to
orderly
start
that's
the
king's
gate
gas
proposition.
here
there
is
the
assumed
as
common
gathering
systems
as
it
now
exist
must
be
divided.
now,
that
division
because
of
the
dispute
in
the
court
should
be
prescribed
specifically
to
include
change
in
the
contract
as
it
was
part
of
the
merger
to
incorporate
all
pre
or
post
merger
additions
and
extensions
of
the
common
gathering
system.
now,
if
a
new
company
is
created
which
becomes
an
adversary
in
the
lower
court,
if
you
accept
that
premise,
then
it
will
be
necessary
also
to
lay
down
to
definite
guidelines
for
the
court,
the
lower
court.
in
--
in
our
view,
there
can
be
only
one
rational
rule
of
distribution
of
assets
and
that's
restoration
of
the
pre-merger
status
quo,
alright.
it
was
found
by
you
that
the
merger
destroyed
competition.
if
anything
less
than
pre-merger
status
quo
is
now
created.
there
can
be
hardly
be
competition
of
this
--
at
the
same
level
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
merger.
another
general
rule
which
we
advocate
here
and
i
can
not
really
say
that
there's
any
precedent.
there
may
be
some
direction
but
there
are
no
cases
on
this.
and
that
is
the
principle
that
no
wrongdoer
should
be
allowed
to
profit
from
his
own
wrong.
now
this
means,
if
you
give
full
effect
to
any
simple
concept
if
you
use
it,
you
have
use
it
in
a
du
pont
but
i
intend
it
abrogating
extension
of
it
to
see
that
el
paso
in
selling
the
assets
and
the
--
that's
what
will
abrogate
the
sale
of
assets.
in
selling
them,
it
should
have
no
pecuniary
gain
from
the
profit.
this
rule
is
i
say
is
without
precedent,
although,
i
think
you
can
find
trends
in
that
direction
in
your
case.
however
if
implemented,
it
means
that
mergers
or
a
merger
applicants
or
those
who
contemplate
merger
from
this
day
forward
will
have
to
look
nor
how
much
they
can
gain
even
if
they
got
caught
but
whether
not
only
will
they
be
deprived
of
the
property
acquired
by
merger
but
also
of
the
profits
which
they
have
gained
during
the
course
of
the
merger.
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
capital
gains.
i
think
the
current
value
for
tax
part
--
purposes
of
the
el
paso
properties
to
be
the
best
is
to
according
to
the
el
paso
exhibit
in
the
lower
court
is
a
$187
million.
the
book
value
of
the
equity
portion
not
after
allowance
for
$180
million
of
bonds
is
$63
million.
the
market
value
according
to
the
transcript,
i'm
sorry
i
lost
the
page,
but
the
transcript
indicates
the
market
value
currently
is
a
$107
million.
now
that
means
there's
approximately
$43
or
$45
million
of
profit,
just
based
on
the
book.
let
alone
for
tax
purposes
which
el
paso
will
have
to
arrive
by
reason
of
its
wrongdoing.
we
urge
that
when
you
provide,
if
you're
willing
to
provide
for
sale
of
these
assets.
the
el
paso
not
be
permitted
to
reach
those
ill-gotten
gains.
this
will
give
long
term
protection
to
the
consumers
not
only
in
oregon
but
throughout
the
nation.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
as
amicus,
i
think
i'm
agree
--
entitled
to
agree
with
the
other
side
everything
on
it.
the
other
side
seems
divided.
oregon
is
in
full
to
support
of
the
el
paso
contention
of
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction.
once
you
have
ordered
of
the
divestiture
and
prescribe
the
terms
of
it
or
proved
the
terms
as
the
case
may
be
their
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdictions
to
alter
those
terms.
it
must
issue
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
in
accordance
of
the
terms
of
decree.
thereafter,
it
can
be
free
to
look
into
under
corporate
dealings,
prices,
rates,
whatever.
so,
we
cannot
at
this
stage,
let
for
protection
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
this
is
another
reason
why
we
think
that
you
must
protect
this.
we
can't
let
the
federal
power
commission.
the
government
takes
an
opposite
view
in
its
brief.
and
perhaps
others
will
take
opposite
views
if
the
matter
does
reach
the
federal
power
commission
without
a
definitive
statement
by
this
court
on
that
question.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
if
you
follow
the
plan
i'm
advocating.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
in
effect
would
depend
upon
the
manner
of
sale
of
the
assets.
if
you
had
a
stock
sale
in
effect,
it
would
work
as
a
premium
on
the
sale
stock
by
a
new
company.
in
other
words,
the
stock
of
the
new
company
placed
on
the
market
would
be
valued
at
approximately
a
$107
million
according
to
record
is
probably
substantially
more
than
that
now.
the
book
equity
is
$63
million
and
so
the
purchaser
on
the
market
will
have
paid
in
the
full
value
to
the
corporation
and
the
corporate
treasury
will
reflect
then,
i
would
presume
in
accounting
they
call
it
paid-in
surplus
for
the
difference
between
the
book
value
of
$63
million
and
the
dollars
received
a
$107
million
--
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
it's
an
indirect
benefit
but
there
is
one.
mr.
richard
w.
sabin
well,
you
have
a
financially
strong
pipeline
company
as
the
immediate
benefit.
the
secondary
method
is
the
not
only
capability
of
striking
facilities
and
so
on
but
the
warrant
of
immediate
upward
pressure
on
rates.
thank
you.
