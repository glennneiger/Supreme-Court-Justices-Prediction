mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
some
very
harsh
things
have
been
said
about
the
stipulation
in
this
decree
by
the
three
appellants
the
more
there's
denying
intervention.
i
think
that
in
all
fairness
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
court
below,
there
were
some
20
applicants
for
intervention
and
that
some
10
or
12
of
them
supported
this
decree
in
every
respect.
i
have
the
--
so
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
decree
is
a
matter
of
opinion.
and
because
only
these
three
appellants
appear
before
this
court
does
not
mean
that
there
are
others
who
would
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
their
appeal.
and
when
i
say
appeal,
i
would
of
course
concur
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
personal
appeal
from
the
decree.
there
was
no
needed
appeal
from
the
order
denying
intervention.
and
20
such
applications
were
denied.
among
others
and
the
application
for
intervention
was
denied
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california
of
which
one
of
the
appellants
is
a
member.
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california
support
this
decree
and
i
am
think
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
state
of
california,
contrary
to
mr.
woodbury's
criticism
and
contrary
to
the
commissioner's
criticism.
we
find
no
appeal
to
support
from
the
two
bars
of
natural
gas
in
california
and
so
it
is
possible
to
some
of
these
criticisms
are
not
entirely
fair.
i
would
like
to
now
speak
for
a
moment
about
el
paso.
it
would
appear
from
all
what
is
said
before
as
though
el
paso
had
a
delightful
time
in
this
litigation.
the
fact
is
of
course
there
were
two
parties
and
el
paso
lost
the
suit
and
el
paso
was
ordered
to
divest.
that
was
in
april
of
1964.
they've
recalled
el
paso
was
called
upon
by
the
attorney
general
to
present
a
plan
of
divestiture.
it
was
said
to
be
the
duty
of
el
paso
to
do
so
and
it
did
present
such
a
plan.
it
was
on
conversation
discussion
and
negotiation
to
the
attorney
general
for
a
period
of
some
four
or
five
months.
in
the
course
of
which,
i
will
show
you
they
were
compelled
to
make
concessions.
they
proceeded
to
solicit
the
consent
of
$785
million
holders
of
debt
of
their
company
to
consent
to
the
division
of
the
property
so
that
the
debt
could
be
realigned.
and
they
secured
those
consents,
100
of
them
with
the
knowledge,
acquiescence
and
consent
of
the
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general
represented
to
the
district
court
twice
in
that
period
that
el
paso
was
proceeding
in
good
faith
to
develop
a
plan
of
complete
divestiture
and
every
time
that
i
say
divestiture,
may
it
please
this
court,
i
mean
complete
divestiture.
and
on
both
occasions,
the
attorney
general
told
the
court
that
el
paso
was
proceeding
in
all
good
faith
than
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
the
parties
could
present
a
stipulated
decree.
finally
in
october,
they
all
had
the
consent.
they
thought
they
had
a
decree
and
they
presented
this
to
the
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
very
well,
your
honor.
however,
may
i
say
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
indicate
that
el
paso
feels
that
it
was
not
likely
dealt
with
that
this
was
not
a
favorable
result
for
el
paso
that
el
paso
did
not
come
off
well
as
some
of
these
parties
would
suggest.
and
so
i
am
suggesting
that
concessions
were
made
all
the
way
along
the
line
in
trading
with
the
attorney
general
in
the
hope
of
getting
them
agreed
divestiture
and
then
finally
and
for
the
first
time
on
december
the
2nd,
the
attorney
general
announced
our
position.
and
the
position
we
announce
was
the
ground
set
forth
the
other
day
which
were
picked
up
for
petitions
for
intervention
theretofore
filed
and
subsequently
the
company
was
compelled
to
yield
on
what
it
considered
to
be
the
major
issue
in
the
case.
could
it
sustain
its
position
in
the
court
or
would
the
attorney
general
that
in
view
of
the
wide
distribution
of
its
stock,
it
could
be
permitted
to
distributive
stock
in
one
form
or
another
to
its
shareholders.
the
counsel
is
in
error.
the
solicitor
general
is
in
error
in
one
respect
only.
we
did
not
propose
the
redding
(ph)
answer.
it
was
forced
in
our
throats
by
the
attorney
general.
and
we
accepted
it
under
protest.
but
we
did
accept
it
for
one
reason
that
relying
upon
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
bind
the
united
states
in
the
settlement,
we
could
bring
him
in
to
this
litigation.
and
after
all,
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
el
paso
to
be
forever
in
court
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
the
question
here
is
not
whether
one
intervenor
shall
be
before
you
criticizing
this
decree,
the
question
is
whether
20
intervenors,
each
one
of
which
has
this
great
or
better
right
than
anyone
who
appeared
here
today
to
intervene
and
express
his
views
should
be
heard
from
also.
and
this
thing
will
develop
into
a
series
of
disputes
between
various
interests,
various
markets,
various
purchasers,
various
states
and
the
end
of
the
litigation
will
not
be
early
or
soon.
and
it
was
that
which
was
the
purpose
of
this
settlement
as
far
as
el
paso
was
concerned.
now,
when
el
paso
made
this
agreement,
when
it
yielded
its
position
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
the
stock,
it
received
something
in
return
it
has
said,
it
received
a
concession
as
to
the
four
or
five
points
which
the
government
had
been
urging
and
which
el
paso
felt
were
totally
lacking
in
legal
or
factual
basis
or
substance.
and
that
therefore,
they
gave
much
and
got
little
but
let
it
be
noted
that
no
one
of
these
matters
which
was
in
dispute
involved
a
question
of
whether
or
not
el
paso
would
diverse
all
of
the
properties
which
it
had
acquired.
and
no
claim
when
analyzed
can
reasonably
be
made
that
an
attempt
to
withhold
any
so-called
fruit
or
benefit
of
the
acquisition.
the
plan
which
was
proposed
and
so
far
as
the
property
is
concerned
accepted,
involved
a
transfer
of
$265
million
in
net
utility
plant.
it
involved
a
division
of
debt
so
that
the
new
company
$180
million
only
$145
million
in
first
mortgage.
we
were
criticized
for
being
able
to
make
this
deal
with
all
of
the
bondholders
and
debenture
holders
what
we
thought
was
the
minimum
cost
of
one-eighth
of
one
percent
and
now
arrive
at
the
present
day
with
an
interest
rate
of
four
and
seven-eights
percent
on
the
average
which
on
the
hold,
may
it
please
this
court,
is
a
pretty
good.
it
certainly
couldn't
be
approved
upon
if
we
had
to
start
over
again.
we
transferred
all
of
the
properties
and
assets
which
we
had
acquired
by
way
of
pipeline
to
the
new
company.
we
transferred
to
the
new
company
all
of
the
extensions
and
betterments
constructed
by
el
paso
at
the
cost
of
$50
million
not
one
dollar
of
which
came
from
pacific
northwest.
we
transferred
a
gasoline
plant
at
the
cost
of
$9.5
million
and
not
one
dollar
of
that
came
from
pacific
northwest.
we
transferred
$7.5
million
--
trillion
cubic
feet
of
reserves
which
was
three
trillion
in
excess
of
what
we
acquired
from
pacific
northwest
and
one
and
seven-tenths
trillion
more
even
after
having
served
the
northwest
public
during
that
entire
period
of
time.
now,
as
--
some
remark
was
made
here,
surely
thoughtlessly
without
the
record
before
the
person
who
made
the
statement.
they
would
not
divest
in
west
coast
transmission
stock,
well
of
course
we
are.
we
have
to
divest
it
within
a
year.
and
we
would
have
divested
it
before
this
but
by
this
appeal
and
we
submit
you
that
all
that
we
said
is
that
we
retain
the
proceeds.
well,
i
assume
that
we
are
going
to
bring
--
permit
obtain
the
proceeds
of
the
divestiture.
at
least,
i
didn't
know
that
divestiture
here
meant
confiscation
and
so
divestiture
is
not
involved
in
that
at
all.
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
a
company
adequately
capitalized
already
should
receive
more
capital
in
the
form
of
their
proceeds
in
the
divested
stock.
and
we
submit
no
case
was
ever
made.
no
claim
ever
made
that
the
new
company
is
not
adequately
financed
to
perform
its
service
in
the
northwest
that
it
would
be
certificated
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
it's
ever
so
much
more
powerful
and
able
to
compete
for
future
increments
of
gas
in
california
than
pacific
northwest
ever
was.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
was
acquired
from
pacific
southwest.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
it
is
ordered
to
be
divested.
it
will
be
sold
for
whatever
the
market
price
is
at
a
loss
because
the
company
el
paso
paid
more
for
it
in
the
purchase
that
is
now
worth.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sorry
i
don't
know
of
any
such
figure,
the
only
place
where
i
remember
$45
million
is
the
money
that
el
paso
spent
in
developing
the
gas
reserves
of
pacific
southwest
in
san
juan
and
not
one
dollar
of
that's
coming
back
and
not
one
dollar
of
that
came
after
pacific
southwest.
barely
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it's
just
as
necessary
for
el
paso
to
serve
the
northwest
as
it
is
for
the
northwest
to
be
served.
it
has
a
duty
to
serve
northwest
and
it
cannot
depart
from
that
duty.
it
also
has
the
duty
to
serve
the
certificated
markets
of
california
in
the
southwest
and
it
must
fulfill
those
duties.
and
it
must
require
and
retain
to
have
the
reserves
on
hand
to
perform
their
contracts
and
to
have
end
el
paso
throughout
this
period
of
merger
has
extensively
acquired
reserves
and
that's
why
it
is
able
to
give
back
to
pacific
south
and
pacific
northwest
not
only
what
it
had
but
three
trillion
more
cubic
feet
of
gas
being
all
of
the
sources
owned
by
el
paso
in
the
rocky
mountain
area
and
connected
to
the
pipeline
system,
all
of
its
access
and
sources
and
in
canada
and
in
addition
285
billion
cubic
feet
acquired
by
them
to
san
juan
basin
which
the
gentleman
speak
in
here
(inaudible).
and
so
we
stand
here
today
with
both
of
the
companies,
the
new
company
and
the
old
company
with
exactly
the
same
deliverability
of
gas
for
its
respective
markets
14
years
with
exactly
the
same
rate
of
interest
for
the
debt
of
all
companies
which
i
assure
it
was
less
than
the
interest
rates
of
today
and
with
the
capitalization
which
i
has
been
approved
of
the
bondholders
or
the
debenture
holders
by
giving
their
consents
to
this
reorganization.
and
so
i
can
link
my
statement
for
today
by
saying,
may
it
please
this
court,
there
has
been
complete,
there
has
been
complete
diversity.
but
beyond
that,
if
these
people
with
the
most
remote
connection
with
the
entire
problem
can
raise
this
issue
before
this
court
then
i
assure
you
that
all
of
a
100
customers
of
el
paso,
all
of
the
thousands
consumers
of
consumers
in
southern
california
along
with
mr.
woodbury's
plant,
the
buyers
in
california
and
the
people
of
other
markets
are
likewise
entitled
to
intervene
to
attempt
to
try
before
this
case
in
this
proceeding
what
shall
be
done
with
the
disputes
of
the
gas
reserves
between
different
markets,
different
purchasers
and
different
interests
and
i
submit
that
is
unrelated
to
the
purpose
of
this
decree
which
is
divestiture
and
not
settlement
of
all
of
the
reserve
problems
in
the
national
gas
industry
of
the
west.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
some
very
harsh
things
have
been
said
about
the
stipulation
in
this
decree
by
the
three
appellants
the
more
there's
denying

that
in

it

and
when
i
say
appeal,
i
would
of

concur
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
personal
appeal
from
the
decree.
there
was
no
needed
appeal
from
the
order
denying
intervention.
and
20
such

were
denied.
among

and
the

was
denied
the

the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california
support
this
decree
and
i
am
think
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
state
of
california,
contrary
to
mr.
woodbury's
criticism
and
contrary
to
the
commissioner's
criticism.
we
find
no

up
for
petitions
for
intervention
theretofore
filed
and
subsequently
the
company
was
compelled
to
yield
on
what
it
considered
to
be
the
major
issue
in
the
case.
could
it
sustain
its
position
in
the
court
or
would
the
attorney
general
that
in
view
of
the
wide
distribution
of
its
stock,
it
could
be
permitted
to
distributive
stock
in
one
form
or
another
to
its
shareholders.
the
counsel
is
in
error.
the
solicitor
general
is
in
error
in
one
respect
only.
we
did
not
propose
the
redding
(ph)
answer.
it
was
forced
in
our
throats
by
the
attorney
general.
and
we
accepted
it
under
protest.
but
we
did
accept
it
for
one
reason
that
relying
upon
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
bind
the
united
states
in
the
settlement,
we
could
bring
him
in
to
this
litigation.
and
after
all,
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
el
paso
to
be
forever
in
court
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
the
question
here
is
not
whether
one
intervenor
shall
be
before
you
criticizing
this
decree,
the
question
is
whether
20
intervenors,
each
one
of
which
has
this
great
or
better
right
than
anyone
who
appeared
here
today
to
intervene
and
express
his
views
should
be
heard
from
also.
and
this
thing
will
develop
into
a
series
of
disputes
between
various
interests,
various
markets,
various
purchasers,
various
states
and
the
end
of
the
litigation
will
not
be
early
or
soon.
and
it
was
that
which
was
the
purpose
of
this
settlement
as
far
as
el
paso
was
concerned.
now,
when
el
paso
made
this
agreement,
when
it
yielded
its
position
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
the
stock,
it
received
something
in
return
it
has
said,
it
received
a
concession
as
to
the
four
or
five
points
which
the
government
had
been
urging
and
which
el
paso
felt
were
totally
lacking
in
legal
or
factual
basis
or
substance.
and
that
therefore,
they
gave
much
and
got
little
but
let
it
be
noted
that
no
one
of
these
matters
which
was
in
dispute
involved
a
question
of
whether
or
not
el
paso
would
diverse
all
of
the
properties
which
it
had
acquired.
and
no
claim
when
analyzed
can
reasonably
be
made
that
an
attempt
to
withhold
any
so-called
fruit
or
benefit
of
the
acquisition.
the
plan
which
was
proposed
and
so
far
as
the
property
is
concerned
accepted,
involved
a
transfer
of
$265
million
in
net
utility
plant.
it
involved
a
division
of
debt
so
that
the
new
company
$180
million
only
$145
million
in
first
mortgage.
we
were
criticized
for
being
able
to
make
this
deal
with
all
of
the
bondholders
and
debenture
holders
what
we
thought
was
the
minimum
cost
of
one-eighth
of
one
percent
and
now
arrive
at
the
present
day
with
an
interest
rate
of
four
and
seven-eights
percent
on
the
average
which
on
the
hold,
may
it
please
this
court,
is
a
pretty
good.
it
certainly
couldn't
be
approved
upon
if
we
had
to
start
over
again.
we
transferred
all
of
the
properties
and
assets
which
we
had
acquired
by
way
of
pipeline
to
the
new
company.
we
transferred
to
the
new
company
all
of
the
extensions
and
betterments
constructed
by
el
paso
at
the
cost
of
$50
million
not
one
dollar
of
which
came
from
pacific
northwest.
we
transferred
a
gasoline
plant
at
the
cost
of
$9.5
million
and
not
one
dollar
of
that
came
from
pacific
northwest.
we
transferred
$7.5
million
--
trillion
cubic
feet
of
reserves
which
was
three
trillion
in
excess
of
what
we
acquired
from
pacific
northwest
and
one
and
seven-tenths
trillion
more
even
after
having
served
the
northwest
public
during
that
entire
period
of
time.
now,
as
--
some
remark
was
made
here,
surely
thoughtlessly
without
the
record
before
the
person
who
made
the
statement.
they
would
not
divest
in
west
coast
transmission
stock,
well
of
course
we
are.
we
have
to
divest
it
within
a
year.
and
we
would
have
divested
it
before
this
but
by
this
appeal
and
we
submit
you
that
all
that
we
said
is
that
we
retain
the
proceeds.
well,
i
assume
that
we
are
going
to
bring
--
permit
obtain
the
proceeds
of
the
divestiture.
at
least,
i
didn't
know
that
divestiture
here
meant
confiscation
and
so
divestiture
is
not
involved
in
that
at
all.
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
a
company
adequately
capitalized
already
should
receive
more
capital
in
the
form
of
their
proceeds
in
the
divested
stock.
and
we
submit
no
case
was
ever
made.
no
claim
ever
made
that
the
new
company
is
not
adequately
financed
to
perform
its
service
in
the
northwest
that
it
would
be
certificated
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
it's
ever
so
much
more
powerful
and
able
to
compete
for
future
increments
of
gas
in
california
than
pacific
northwest
ever
was.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
was
acquired
from
pacific
southwest.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
it
is
ordered
to
be
divested.
it
will
be
sold
for
whatever
the
market
price
is
at
a
loss
because
the
company
el
paso
paid
more
for
it
in
the
purchase
that
is
now
worth.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sorry
i
don't
know
of
any
such
figure,
the
only
place
where
i
remember
$45
million
is
the
money
that
el
paso
spent
in
developing
the
gas
reserves
of
pacific
southwest
in
san
juan
and
not
one
dollar
of
that's
coming
back
and
not
one
dollar
of
that
came
after
pacific
southwest.
barely
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it's
just
as
necessary
for
el
paso
to
serve
the
northwest
as
it
is
for
the
northwest
to
be
served.
it
has
a
duty
to
serve
northwest
and
it
cannot
depart
from
that
duty.
it
also
has
the
duty
to
serve
the
certificated
markets
of
california
in
the
southwest
and
it
must
fulfill
those
duties.
and
it
must
require
and
retain
to
have
the
reserves
on
hand
to
perform
their
contracts
and
to
have
end
el
paso
throughout
this
period
of
merger
has
extensively
acquired
reserves
and
that's
why
it
is
able
to
give
back
to
pacific
south
and
pacific
northwest
not
only
what
it
had
but
three
trillion
more
cubic
feet
of
gas
being
all
of
the
sources
owned
by
el
paso
in
the
rocky
mountain
area
and
connected
to
the
pipeline
system,
all
of
its
access
and
sources
and
in
canada
and
in
addition
285
billion
cubic
feet
acquired
by
them
to
san
juan
basin
which
the
gentleman
speak
in
here
(inaudible).
and
so
we
stand
here
today
with
both
of
the
companies,
the
new
company
and
the
old
company
with
exactly
the
same
deliverability
of
gas
for
its
respective
markets
14
years
with
exactly
the
same
rate
of
interest
for
the
debt
of
all
companies
which
i
assure
it
was
less
than
the
interest
rates
of
today
and
with
the
capitalization
which
i
has
been
approved
of
the
bondholders
or
the
debenture
holders
by
giving
their
consents
to
this
reorganization.
and
so
i
can
link
my
statement
for
today
by
saying,
may
it
please
this
court,
there
has
been
complete,
there
has
been
complete
diversity.
but
beyond
that,
if
these
people
with
the
most
remote
connection
with
the
entire
problem
can
raise
this
issue
before
this
court
then
i
assure
you
that
all
of
a
100
customers
of
el
paso,
all
of
the
thousands
consumers
of
consumers
in
southern
california
along
with
mr.
woodbury's
plant,
the
buyers
in
california
and
the
people
of
other
markets
are
likewise
entitled
to
intervene
to
attempt
to
try
before
this
case
in
this
proceeding
what
shall
be
done
with
the
disputes
of
the
gas
reserves
between
different
markets,
different
purchasers
and
different
interests
and
i
submit
that
is
unrelated
to
the
purpose
of
this
decree
which
is
divestiture
and
not
settlement
of
all
of
the
reserve
problems
in
the
national
gas
industry
of
the
west.
