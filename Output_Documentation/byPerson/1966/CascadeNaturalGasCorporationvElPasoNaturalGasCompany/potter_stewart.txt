justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bennett,
what
we
have
is
a
consent
type
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
decree
below
entered
by
consent?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
that
--
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
your
position
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
the
--
this
litigation
was
brought
by
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
has
expressed
to
tell
for
entering
or
by
consenting
to
this
form
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
satisfied
that
this
is
the
disposition
of
any
inputs
that
it
had?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
united
states
in
fact
there
are
last
position
had
decided
to
give
up
the
whole
litigation.
could
have
they
done
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
dismissed
the
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you
say,
gives
you
a
right
to
intervene?
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
i'm
sorry
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
physically,
i
have
with
that
statement
if
what's
involved
in
this
appeal
is
simply
this
that
your
appeal,
unless
i'm
mistaken
tell
me
if
i
am
as
well
as
the
other
two
appeals,
are
appeals
from
denials
and
motions
to
intervene.
and
really
the
issue
as
i
therefore
see
it
is
whether
or
not
the
court
is
through
action
denying
the
motion
to
intervene
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
involves
to
subsections
about
(a)
whether
or
not
you
had
a
right
to
intervene
and
if
not,
(b)
whether
you
had
a
--the
court
had
discretion
to
allow
to
intervene
in
subsection
1
under
(b),
whether
or
not
if
so
he
had
used
that
discretion.
and
it
seems
to
me
those
are
the
issues
before
us
rather
than
ones
you
stated.
if
you
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
read
the
chief
justice
taft's,
if
you
would
expand
chief
justice
taft's
word
without
properly
brought
before
this
court
to
properly
or
improperly,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
isn't
a
question
here
from
--
isn't
the
decisions
from
which
you
have
an
appeal
here
which
is
before
us
for
argument
today.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
should
have
been
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
the
only
order
from
which
an
appeal
have
been
taken?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
the
point
in
continental
was
sort
of
the
court
there
without
dealing
with
the
person
who
--
parties
who
had
intervened,
not
merely
those
who
had
tried
to
intervene
tell
itself
not
bound
by
the
bare
assignments
of
error,
is
that
right?
and
if
the
court
on
his
owned
his
motion,
one
had
considerably
the
proper
limits
of
the
decree.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought
here.
justice
potter
stewart
further
--
further
question
if
we
read
continental
correctly,
if
i
read
continental
correctly
that
if
the
case
is
here,
as
it
is
apparently
is
as
we
noted
jurisdiction
of
whether
the
court
on
this
motion
couldn't
consider
these
matters.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
of
what
this
case
is
properly
here
whatever
is
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
case
is
that
--
the
case
is
properly
here
to
consider
that
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
another
case
being
properly
here
doesn't
continental
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
what's
the
question
here
whether
if
there's
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
depends
what
case
you're
talking
about
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
want
me
to
read
it
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
goes
so
far
i
gather,
mr.
friedman,
that
it
does
that
in
this
litigation
after
your
victory
here
you
could
have
dismissed
the
whole
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
suggesting
it
i'm
–
doesn't
your
argument
goes
so
far
as
to
say
even
though
you're
here
and
of
course
that's
the
only
reason
that
you
bring
the
lawsuit
is
in
the
public
interest.
yet
the
united
states
for
whatever
reason
applied
but
on
entirely
good
faith
they
decided
didn't
want
the
decree
and
dismiss
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
freidman,
there
isn't
really
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
divestiture
provided,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
they
don't
say
there
hasn't
been
divestiture.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
right
way?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
been
divestiture?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
planning
a
divestiture
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
harrison,
i
don't
think
any
question
of
good
faith
has
been
raised
here
at
all.
justice

mr.

what

and
it
seems
to
me
those

rather
than
