mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
southern
california,
the
edison
company,
in
this
proceeding
has
recognized
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
40.
is
that
verging
the
restoration
of
a
new
company
after
the
divestiture
as
it
effective
competitor
for
the
california
market,
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
this
court?
it
may
be
recalled
that
it's
in
1964
decision
ordering
divestiture
as
this
court
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
“edison
search
for
a
burned
supply
of
natural
gas
in
california
when
it
had
el
paso
gas
only
on
an
interrupt
basis.
illustrates
what
effect
pacific
northwest
had
merely
as
a
potential
competitor
in
the
california
market.”
i
might
state
the
situation
with
the
respect
of
the
kind
of
service
which
we
have
through
el
paso
has
not
change
from
that
situation
that
it
existed
at
the
time.
this
court
further
observed
after
referring
to
the
enormous
gas
reserves
among
others
which
pacific
northwest
had
in
the
san
juan
basin
in
which
was
the
principal
area
where
the
competition
for
gas
supplies
between
pacific
northwest
in
el
paso
took
place
before
the
illegal
merger.
this
court
said,
have
pacific
northwest
remained
independent,
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
would
have
sought
to
exploit
its
formidable
geographical
position
vis-à-vis
california.
now
the
real
substantive
question
as
we
see
it
before
this
court
is
whether
a
plan
of
divestiture
which
was
characterized
by
the
district
court
judge
who
signed
the
decree
by
the
statement
and
i
quote,
“you
see
what
this
plan
proposes
is
a
division
of
the
country,
a
division
of
the
market,
a
division
of
the
reserves
one
area
to
new
company
and
another
area
to
el
paso
that
is
what
the
root
of
this
plan
is”
and
that's
found
at
976
of
the
record
whether
that
kind
of
a
decree
complies
with
this
court's
mandate
ordering
divestiture
to
dissolve
the
merger
which
it
had
determined
to
be
violative
of
the
anti-competitive
--
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
of
its
anticompetitive
effects.
now,
on
february
4,
1965,
the
date
of
the
last
hearing
on
divestiture
other
than
the
hearings
that
came
after
the
stipulated
judgment
that
followed
sometime
thereafter.
this
root
of
the
el
paso
scheme
was
also
recognized
by
the
government
where
government
counsel
stated
in
part
as
follows.
“this
company
that
is
being
set
up
under
the
el
paso
proposal
is
if
i
may
use
the
word,
‘straitjacketed'
to
serve
the
northwest
markets.
it
is
not
in
any
position
to
serve
the
california
markets
with
respect
to
an
expansion
program
to
the
california
markets.
the
company
is
not
as
strong
as
the
company
had
been
before.
it
is
not
as
likely
to
be
able
to
serve
the
california
markets
as
pacific
northwest
was
at
the
time
of
acquisition
in
this
case.”
that's
at
the
record
1355
to
1356.
now,
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
whatsoever
between
the
divestiture
arrangement
embodied
in
the
decree
signed
by
the
district
court
and
the
divestiture
plan
as
previously
proposed
by
el
paso.
in
this
regard
that
would
in
any
way
change
the
appropriateness
of
the
characterizations
which
i
have
quoted
as
describing
the
decree.
the
question
concerning
--
concerned
with
the
appropriate
manner
of
the
disposition
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company
as
to
which
the
government
secured
a
minor
alternation
in
el
paso's
proposed
plan.
obviously,
relates
only
to
the
issue
of
the
company's
will
to
compete.
in
contrast,
the
abandoned
issues
concerning
the
disposition
of
assets
and
the
physical
properties
and
the
restoration
of
contract
rights
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
those
relates
to
the
ability
of
the
company
to
compete
for
the
california
market.
now,
no
arrangement
with
respect
to
the
spin
off
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company,
however
successful
in
establishing
an
independent
will
to
compete
for
the
california
market
could
cure
the
debilitating
effects
and
weaknesses
imposed
upon
the
new
company.
with
respect
to
the
--
its
ability
to
compete
by
the
issues
which
were
abandoned
and
which
we
submit
were
not
capable
of
being
withdrawn
or
abandoned
without
sacrificing
this
court's
mandate.
now,
those
is
--
now,
those
important
issues
included
the
following.
first,
the
failure
of
the
divestiture
decree
to
allocate
any
portion
of
the
gas
reserves
acquired
in
the
san
juan
basin
and
after
the
illegal
merger
to
the
new
company,
such
gas
being
bought
the
cheapest
in
cost
at
the
wellhead
and
the
closest
to
california.
the
position
of
the
government
all
during
the
divestiture
hearings
was
at
the
–
such
that
the
new
company's
position
was
less
favorable
by
between
640
billion
and
one
and
a
half
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
in
the
san
juan
basin.
and
those
figures
were
developed
on
the
basis
of
data
from
el
paso
own
witnesses
and
el
paso's
own
records.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i'll
be
happy
to
direct
my
--
to
state
my
position
mr.
justice
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
don't
believe
we
do,
your
honor,
and
let
me
state
why.
first,
i
should
like
to
say
that
it
is
our
position
that
we
were
improperly
denied
intervention
because
we
think
that
we
were
would
be
bound
under
the
judgment
as
within
the
scope
of
expediting
act
as
it
has
been
construed
and
we
think
properly
construed
by
the
courts
--
the
ford
versus
bisanz
case.
and
we
think
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
--
and
the
--
i
would
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
page
57,
the
government
--
we
believe
grants
that
edison
have
an
interest
in
the
proceeding
were
--
they
say,
were
not
happy
to
represented
and
of
course
we
contend
we
were
not.
they
would
support
a
claim
of
intervention
of
right
that
appears
on
page
57.
we
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
sir?
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
no,
sir.
we
are
application
to
intervene
came
after
we
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
extraordinary
development
when
the
issues
concerning
the
ability
to
compete
in
california
were
completely
abandoned
and
that
occurred
after
the
divestiture
here.
secondly
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
of
course
think
that
we
were
not
adequately
represented
from
the
time
that
the
government
abandoned
these
positions
and
stipulated
and
that
--
from
that
time
on
it
would
have
been
in
no
position
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
believe
it
was
my
recollection,
your
honor,
that
it
went
to
both.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
but
let
me
say
this
and
this
i
think
is
the
more
important
point
from
our
standpoint
or
--
and
i
think
from
the
court
standpoint
and
that
is
that
while
it
--
we
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
intervention
need
necessarily
be
determined
first
or
we
do
not
think
that
if
it
is
determined
first,
this
court
should
stop
there
because
we
believe
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
mandate
of
this
court.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
in
el
paso
does
as
i
understand
it
that
that
didn't
make
any
difference.
but
we
may
--
we
think
it
makes
a
very
real
difference
that
this
is
a
mandate
of
this
court
that
cannot
that
the
government
cannot
be
deal
with
in
anyway
it
sees
fit.
now,
let
me
just
post
before
the
court,
a
hypothetical
question
which
i
think
may
focused
the
importance
of
this
position
and
i
think
it
is
quite
important
to
your
honors
as
well
as
to
us.
let's
assume
if
you
will
a
case
where
--
this
court
had
issued
a
mandate
ordering
divestiture
without
delay
as
in
this
case.
let's
assume
further
that
the
parties
are
denied
--
applications
for
intervention
both
permissive
and
as
of
right
are
made
and
they're
denied.
and
for
the
purpose
of
my
hypothetical
case,
let
us
assume
they're
denied
properly
which
we
do
not
think
is
this
case.
let's
further
assume
that
the
government
thereafter
stipulates
to
a
judgment
in
good
faith
with
any
malfeasance
but
let's
further
assume
it's
a
judgment
which
violates
the
mandate
of
this
court.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
do
not
believe
they
could
have
do
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
because
the
mandate
of
this
court
would
then
clearly
be
frustrate.
this
court
has
ordered
divestiture
without
delay.
it
is
no
warrant
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
in
the
antitrust
field
your
honor
and
in
view
of
the
responsibilities
which
this
court
refers
to
quite
at
length
in
du
pont.
the
extraordinary
responsibilities
are
not
going
to
allow
a
single
judge
to
decide
these
antitrust
matters
because
of
their
broad
public
importance.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
precisely.
but
here
under
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
decree
which
under
the
assumption
violates
what
this
court
intends
to
have
taken
out.
and
until
we
have
to
the
effect
of
this
court
intended
because
of
a
stipulated
judgment.
now
certainly,
this
court's
interpretation
in
du
pont
of
the
holding
in
continental
is
that
this
court
can't
be
circumscribed
by
any
stipulation
of
the
government.
that's
the
--
that's
the
footnote
in
the
continental
--
in
the
du
pont
case
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
i'm
glad
you
did
your
honor
because
i
think
it
is
significant.
i
think
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
that
makes
a
very
real
difference
and
further
if
i
may
say
so,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
should
stop
at
deciding
the
question
of
intervention
because
what
it
ordered
if
it
meant
what
it
said
in
this
case,
when
it
ordered
divestiture
without
delay.
if
all
you
decide
here
today
is
that
we
should
have
been
permitted
to
intervene
and
nothing
more
and
you
send
this
case
back
there's
going
to
be
lot
longer
hearings
and
we're
probably
going
to
be
back
up
here
again
and
that's
unnecessary
i
submit.
if
this
court
at
this
time
spells
out
with
enough
particularity
that
it
cannot
be
misunderstood
as
it
was
in
this
case
in
our
opinion
what
this
court
once
done.
and
certainly,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
is
powerless
to
see
that
its
mandate
is
carried
out.
that's
fundamentally
the
difference
procedurally
between
our
position
and
that
of
the
government
as
we
see
it.
in
fact
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
no,
sir.
but
it
seems
to
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
--
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
let
me
say
this,
if
that's
what
the
court
meant
in
continental
and
du
pont
that
you
have
to
have
a
party
who
had
been
admittedly
intervened.
they
didn't
have
to
say
in
any
proper
way.
they
said
in
this
way.
now,
they
--
they
point
out
not
only
that
if
the
matters
brought
to
this
court's
attention
in
any
proper
way.
they
also
say
they
could
do
it
on
their
own
motion.
and
we
just
think
it
is
ridiculous
to
suggest
and
we
don't
think
there's
any
legal
sophistry
that
will
justify
a
conclusion
in
soundness
that
this
court
could
be
rendered
powerless
to
see
that
its
mandate
was
carried
out
by
a
stipulated
judgment
made
and
under
my
assumption
by
a
mistake
that
violated
the
mandate
of
this
court.
we
just
don't
believe
that
either
should
be
or
is
the
law
under
continental
and
du
pont.
now,
return
to
the
things
which
were
abandoned.
the
important
issue
if
it
were
abandoned
in
this
case.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
government's
position
and
the
el
paso's
position
in
this
case,
what
we
are
saying
is,
even
if
what
i
said
in
my
hypothetical
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
was
that
even
if
you
assume
that
intervention
was
properly
denied.
we
don't
believe
under
continental
and
du
pont
that
this
court
is
powerless
and
it
is
bound
by
a
stipulated
judgment
entered
into
by
the
government
which
violates
its
mandate.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
ordered
you
divestiture
without
delay.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well
that
was
in
1964,
of
course
this
case
started
as
mr.
bennett
pointed
out
about
10
years
ago.
and
as
he
pointed
out
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
1964.
yes,
sir.
the
requirement
is
correct.
now,
what
about
the
other
abandoned
issues?
the
failure
of
divestiture
--
of
the
divestiture
decree
to
restore
the
new
company
to
the
proceeds
of
the
west
coast
transmission
company
stock
which
was
owned
by
pacific
northwest
before
the
merger.
they
are
going
to
give
the
proceeds
to
el
paso
and
in
the
connection,
el
paso
you'll
find
in
their
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief
in
reference
to
the
recently
negotiated
canadian
gas
contract
which
increases
the
price
of
gas
significantly
that
they
purport
--
intend
to
imposed
on
the
new
company.
now,
that
isn't
going
to
help
the
new
company
compete
in
california.
although,
it
may
very
well
enhance
the
value
of
the
west
coast
transmission
company
stock
which
under
this
decree
goes
to
el
paso
and
not
the
pacific
northwest
that
owned
it
before
the
merger.
they
made
unilateral
changes
in
this
decree
and
the
contracts.
every
one
of
them
to
the
disadvantaged
of
the
new
company
and
will
render
the
new
comany
less
able
to
compete
for
the
california
market.
they
also
gave
no
allocations
whatsoever
of
a
tax
law's
carry
over
benefit
of
more
than
$50
million
which
el
paso
got
because
of
pacific
northwest
tax
situation
and
which
they
used
to
their
benefit
in
the
net
about
of
about
$28
million
are
shown
by
this
record.
now
all
of
these
items
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
sir?
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well
grant
--
if
we
were
permitted
intervention
your
honor,
we
would
claim
that
we
would
have
a
right
to
litigate
the
propriety
of
requiring
as
the
government
contended
all
through
the
divestiture
hearings.
the
propriety
of
contending
that
the
ability
of
this
new
company
--
the
decree
should
be
such
as
to
restore
its
ability
to
compete
for
the
california
market
in
a
position
at
least
the
strong
as
was
the
old
company
at
the
time
the
illegal
merger.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
conform
to
the
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
conforms
to
the
mandate
of
this
court.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
i
would
think
your
honor,
if
we're
permitted
to
intervene
that
the
--
that
we
would
to
be
permitted
to
litigate
all
of
the
questions
and
issues
involved
in
reestablishing
a
new
company
that
was
as
strong
as
and
able
to
compete
for
the
california
market
as
was
the
old
company.
i
may
be
missing
the
import
of
your
question
but
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well
i
would
think,
we
would
have
the
right
to
litigate
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
would
think
so.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
i
claim.
of
course,
that
the
matter
was
originally
sent
down
to
the
court
that
in
--
would
order
divestiture
without
delay.
now,
i
think
that
if
this
court
would
do
what
i
think
it
should
in
at
this
time
and
specify
what
factor
should
be
applied
in
this
allegation
and
how
the
matter
should
be
disposed
of.
i
think
we
could
then
be
entitled
to
litigate
the
--
all
of
the
issues
that
would
be
involved
in
assuring
our
position
as
to
how
that
mandate
should
be
complied
with.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
think
so
until
this
court's
mandate
would
change.
yes,
sir.
the
government
vigorously
urged
all
of
these
points
all
during
the
divestiture
case
and
the
record
in
the
case
is
the
void
of
any
explanation
to
this
extraordinary
abandonment
of
these
issues.
and
i
intended
to
discuss
them
but
i
will
simply
say
to
you
gentlemen,
that
the
reasons
which
are
given
the
explanation
if
they
may
be
called
at
which
are
given
for
the
first
time
now
in
this
brief
by
the
government.
if
you
read
them,
i'm
sure
you
will
not
be
persuaded
as
we
are
not
that
they
are
sound
explanations
and
the
important
thing
is
everything
they
talked
about
here,
they
had
available
to
them,
the
data,
the
arguments,
the
evidence
at
the
time
they
file
their
brief
after
divestiture
hearings
and
there's
nothing
new
in
this
brief
just
to
give
any
explanation
as
to
why
they
change
their
positions.
we
submit
that
this
decree
does
not
conform
with
this
court's
mandate.
we
submit
that
the
judge
have
a
completely
incorrect
understanding
of
which
--
of
what
this
court
ordered
when
it
decided
that
a
division
of
the
country
or
division
of
the
market
in
antitrust
case.
a
division
of
the
market,
one
area
to
el
paso,
one
area
to
the
new
company
couldn't
be
what
this
court
intended
and
we
submit
therefore
that
this
court
is
not
neither
powerless
to
insist
that
its
mandate
be
followed
but
they
certainly
should
do
so.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
in
fact,
i
will,
your
honor.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
if
your
honor
please.
the
main
thrust
of
our
contention
with
respect
to
non-divestiture
is
the
question
of
gas
reserves.
el
paso
proposes
to
reconstitute
and
i
use
this
word
deliberately
because
this
is
taken
out
of
the
opinion
that
this
court
handed
down
on
the
cheyanne
case
that
divestiture
means
restitution
and
el
paso
proposes
to
set
up
a
company
with
vast
new
demands
for
gas
which
had
developed
over
the
period
of
this
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
has
in
the
san
juan
alone
one
half
of
the
relative
reserves
that
it
had
relative
to
canadian
reserves
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
by
el
paso
of
the
stock.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
it
is
a
relative
concept
yes.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
at
that
time,
at
that
time,
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
had
1.95
times
the
reserves
in
san
juan
that
it
had
in
canada.
now,
el
paso
proposes
to
create
a
new
company
marginal
that
will
meet
fpc
minimum
standards
with
almost
complete
dependence
upon
canadian
reserves
and
el
paso
was
in
the
federal
power
commission
today
seeking
new
reserves
to
serve
the
pacific
northwest
not
to
serve
california
and
it
has
the
authority
to
tell
the
district
court
judge
and
now
us
that
it
is
creating
a
viable
new
entity
which
you
people,
which
this
court
found
had
been
destroyed
by
the
violation
that
is
able
to
compete
in
california.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
in
the
san
juan
basin
alone.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
it
leaves
them
with
roughly
one-third
in
the
from
canada,
one-third
from
san
juan,
and
one-third
from
the
rocky
mountain
area
based
upon
the
figures
which
el
paso
submitted
in
the
district
court
hearing.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
it
--
it's
a
relative
manner.
we
--
we're
not
able
on
the
record
on
this
case
to
compare
the
size
of
the
reserves
in
terms
of
thousands
of
cubic
feet
because
there's
a
difference
of
method
of
measurement
in
the
long
period
of
as
to
last,
so
we
have
to
approach
it
on
the
relative
basis.
and
pacific
northwest
pipe
line
which
build
its
line,
mind
you
from
san
juan
to
the
pacific
northwest
and
still
expected
as
this
court
found
to
be
a
viable
competitor
in
california
with
dedicated
reserves
in
the
san
juan
el
paso
now
says
that
we'll
give
you
back
what
you
had
then
and
maybe
a
little
bit
more
from
fields
that
--
from
wells
which
pacific
was
developing
at
that
time
and
that's
it.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
that
is
our
position.
for
example
in
the
several
years
about
four
years
following
the
acquisition
of
the
stock,
el
paso
brought
in
a
whole
new
formation
below
the
fields
where
pacific
northwest
had
been
exploring
and
developing.
and
the
figure
is
the
neighborhood
of
four
trillion
cubic
feet
and
they
do
not
propose
to
turn
this
over
to
the
new
company.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
for
one
moment
to
the
government's
contention
about
very
grave
consequences
if
these
applicants
are
not
permitted
in.
i
draw
your
honors'
attention
again
to
this
--
to
the
nature
of
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
public
service
company
that
customers
are
public
service
companies
completely
dependent
upon
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
as
to
their
future.
they
built
their
organizations.
they've
incurred
their
debt.
they've
marketed
securities
and
they
have
acquired
customers
in
the
expectation
that
their
supplier
will
be
a
company
that
has
vast
surplus
gas
reserves.
this
court
found
that
pacific
northwest
pipeline
was
such
a
company
and
we
know
that
el
paso
is
such
a
company.
now,
in
order
to
restore
that
competitive
position,
the
reserve
situation
alone
must
be
modified.
in
addition,
el
paso
seeks
to
retain
certain
other
benefits.
thank
you.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
southern
california,
the
edison
company,
in
this
proceeding
has
recognized
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
40.
is
that
verging
the
restoration
of
a
new
company
after
the
divestiture
as
it
effective
competitor
for
the
california
market,
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
this
court?
it
may
be
recalled
that
it's
in
1964
decision
ordering
divestiture
as
this
court
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
“edison
search
for
a
burned
supply
of
natural
gas
in
california
when
it
had
el
paso
gas
only
on
an
interrupt
basis.
illustrates
what
effect
pacific
northwest
had
merely
as
a
potential
competitor
in
the
california
market.”
i
might
state
the
situation
with
the
respect
of
the
kind
of
service
which
we
have
through
el
paso
has
not
change
from
that
situation
that
it
existed
at
the
time.
this
court
further
observed
after
referring
to
the
enormous
gas
reserves
among
others
which
pacific
northwest
had
in
the
san
juan
basin
in
which
was
the
principal
area
where
the
competition
for
gas
supplies
between
pacific
northwest
in
el
paso
took
place
before
the
illegal
merger.
this
court
said,
have
pacific
northwest
remained
independent,
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
would
have
sought
to
exploit
its
formidable
geographical
position
vis-à-vis
california.
now
the
real
substantive
question
as
we
see
it
before
this
court
is
whether
a
plan
of
divestiture
which
was
characterized
by
the
district
court
judge
who
signed
the
decree
by
the
statement
and
i
quote,
“you
see
what
this
plan
proposes
is
a
division
of
the
country,
a
division
of
the
market,
a
division
of
the
reserves
one
area
to
new
company
and
another
area
to
el
paso
that
is
what
the
root
of
this
plan
is”
and
that's
found
at
976
of
the
record
whether
that
kind
of
a
decree
complies
with
this
court's
mandate
ordering
divestiture
to
dissolve
the
merger
which
it
had
determined
to
be
violative
of
the
anti-competitive
--
of
the
antitrust
laws
because
of
its
anticompetitive
effects.
now,
on
february
4,
1965,
the
date
of
the
last
hearing
on
divestiture
other
than
the
hearings
that
came
after
the
stipulated
judgment
that
followed
sometime
thereafter.
this
root
of
the
el
paso
scheme
was
also
recognized
by
the
government
where
government
counsel
stated
in
part
as
follows.
“this
company
that
is
being
set
up
under
the
el
paso
proposal
is
if
i
may
use
the
word,
‘straitjacketed'
to
serve
the
northwest
markets.
it
is
not
in
any
position
to
serve
the
california
markets
with
respect
to
an
expansion
program
to
the
california
markets.
the
company
is
not
as
strong
as
the
company
had
been
before.
it
is
not
as
likely
to
be
able
to
serve
the
california
markets
as
pacific
northwest
was
at
the
time
of
acquisition
in
this
case.”
that's
at
the
record
1355
to
1356.
now,
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
whatsoever
between
the
divestiture
arrangement
embodied
in
the
decree
signed
by
the
district
court
and
the
divestiture
plan
as
previously
proposed
by
el
paso.
in
this
regard
that
would
in
any
way
change
the
appropriateness
of
the
characterizations
which
i
have
quoted
as
describing
the
decree.
the
question
concerning
--
concerned
with
the
appropriate
manner
of
the
disposition
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company
as
to
which
the
government
secured
a
minor
alternation
in
el
paso's
proposed
plan.
obviously,
relates
only
to
the
issue
of
the
company's
will
to
compete.
in
contrast,
the
abandoned
issues
concerning
the
disposition
of
assets
and
the
physical
properties
and
the
restoration
of
contract
rights
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
those
relates
to
the
ability
of
the
company
to
compete
for
the
california
market.
now,
no
arrangement
with
respect
to
the
spin
off
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company,
however
successful
in
establishing
an
independent
will
to
compete
for
the
california
market
could
cure
the
debilitating
effects
and
weaknesses
imposed
upon
the
new
company.
with
respect
to
the
--
its
ability
to
compete
by
the
issues
which
were
abandoned
and
which
we
submit
were
not
capable
of
being
withdrawn
or
abandoned
without
sacrificing
this
court's
mandate.
now,
those
is
--
now,
those
important
issues
included
the
following.
first,
the
failure
of
the
divestiture
decree
to
allocate
any
portion
of
the
gas
reserves
acquired
in
the
san
juan
basin
and
after
the
illegal
merger
to
the
new
company,
such
gas
being
bought
the
cheapest
in
cost
at
the
wellhead
and
the
closest
to
california.
the
position
of
the
government
all
during
the
divestiture
hearings
was
at
the
–
such
that
the
new
company's
position
was
less
favorable
by
between
640
billion
and
one
and
a
half
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
in
the
san
juan
basin.
and
those
figures
were
developed
on
the
basis
of
data
from
el
paso
own
witnesses
and
el
paso's
own
records.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i'll
be
happy
to
direct
my
--
to
state
my
position
mr.
justice
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
don't
believe
we
do,
your
honor,
and
let
me
state
why.
first,
i
should
like
to
say
that
it
is
our
position
that
we
were
improperly
denied
intervention
because
we
think
that
we
were
would
be
bound
under
the
judgment
as
within
the
scope
of
expediting
act
as
it
has
been
construed
and
we
think
properly
construed
by
the
courts
--
the
ford
versus
bisanz
case.
and
we
think
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
--
and
the
--
i
would
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
page
57,
the
government
--
we
believe
grants
that
edison
have
an
interest
in
the
proceeding
were
--
they
say,
were
not
happy
to
represented
and
of
course
we
contend
we
were
not.
they
would
support
a
claim
of
intervention
of
right
that
appears
on
page
57.
we
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
sir?
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
no,
sir.
we
are
application
to
intervene
came
after
we
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
extraordinary
development
when
the
issues
concerning
the
ability
to
compete
in
california
were
completely
abandoned
and
that
occurred
after
the
divestiture
here.
secondly
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
of
course
think
that
we
were
not
adequately
represented
from
the
time
that
the
government
abandoned
these
positions
and
stipulated
and
that
--
from
that
time
on
it
would
have
been
in
no
position
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
believe
it
was
my
recollection,
your
honor,
that
it
went
to
both.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
but
let
me
say
this
and
this
i
think
is
the
more
important
point
from
our
standpoint
or
--
and
i
think
from
the
court
standpoint
and
that
is
that
while
it
--
we
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
intervention
need
necessarily
be
determined
first
or
we
do
not
think
that
if
it
is
determined
first,
this
court
should
stop
there
because
we
believe
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
mandate
of
this
court.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
in
el
paso
does
as
i
understand
it
that
that
didn't
make
any
difference.
but
we
may
--
we
think
it
makes
a
very
real
difference
that
this
is
a
mandate
of
this
court
that
cannot
that
the
government
cannot
be
deal
with
in
anyway
it
sees
fit.
now,
let
me
just
post
before
the
court,
a
hypothetical
question
which
i
think
may
focused
the
importance
of
this
position
and
i
think
it
is
quite
important
to
your
honors
as
well
as
to
us.
let's
assume
if
you
will
a
case
where
--
this
court
had
issued
a
mandate
ordering
divestiture
without
delay
as
in
this
case.
let's
assume
further
that
the
parties
are
denied
--
applications
for
intervention
both
permissive
and
as
of
right
are
made
and
they're
denied.
and
for
the
purpose
of
my
hypothetical
case,
let
us
assume
they're
denied
properly
which
we
do
not
think
is
this
case.
let's
further
assume
that
the
government
thereafter
stipulates
to
a
judgment
in
good
faith
with
any
malfeasance
but
let's
further
assume
it's
a
judgment
which
violates
the
mandate
of
this
court.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
do
not
believe
they
could
have
do
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
because
the
mandate
of
this
court
would
then
clearly
be
frustrate.
this
court
has
ordered
divestiture
without
delay.
it
is
no
warrant
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
in
the
antitrust
field
your
honor
and
in
view
of
the
responsibilities
which
this
court
refers
to
quite
at
length
in
du
pont.
the
extraordinary
responsibilities
are
not
going
to
allow
a
single
judge
to
decide
these
antitrust
matters
because
of
their
broad
public
importance.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
precisely.
but
here
under
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
decree
which
under
the
assumption
violates
what
this
court
intends
to
have
taken
out.
and
until
we
have
to
the
effect
of
this
court
intended
because
of
a
stipulated
judgment.
now
certainly,
this
court's
interpretation
in
du
pont
of
the
holding
in
continental
is
that
this
court
can't
be
circumscribed
by
any
stipulation
of
the
government.
that's
the
--
that's
the
footnote
in
the
continental
--
in
the
du
pont
case
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
i'm
glad
you
did
your
honor
because
i
think
it
is
significant.
i
think
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
that
makes
a
very
real
difference
and
further
if
i
may
say
so,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
should
stop
at
deciding
the
question
of
intervention
because
what
it
ordered
if
it
meant
what
it
said
in
this
case,
when
it
ordered
divestiture
without
delay.
if
all
you
decide
here
today
is
that
we
should
have
been
permitted
to
intervene
and
nothing
more
and
you
send
this
case
back
there's
going
to
be
lot
longer
hearings
and
we're
probably
going
to
be
back
up
here
again
and
that's
unnecessary
i
submit.
if
this
court
at
this
time
spells
out
with
enough
particularity
that
it
cannot
be
misunderstood
as
it
was
in
this
case
in
our
opinion
what
this
court
once
done.
and
certainly,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
is
powerless
to
see
that
its
mandate
is
carried
out.
that's
fundamentally
the
difference
procedurally
between
our
position
and
that
of
the
government
as
we
see
it.
in
fact
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
no,
sir.
but
it
seems
to
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
--
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
let
me
say
this,
if
that's
what
the
court
meant
in
continental
and
du
pont
that
you
have
to
have
a
party
who
had
been
admittedly
intervened.
they
didn't
have
to
say
in
any
proper
way.
they
said
in
this
way.
now,
they
--
they
point
out
not
only
that
if
the
matters
brought
to
this
court's
attention
in
any
proper
way.
they
also
say
they
could
do
it
on
their
own
motion.
and
we
just
think
it
is
ridiculous
to
suggest
and
we
don't
think
there's
any
legal
sophistry
that
will
justify
a
conclusion
in
soundness
that
this
court
could
be
rendered
powerless
to
see
that
its
mandate
was
carried
out
by
a
stipulated
judgment
made
and
under
my
assumption
by
a
mistake
that
violated
the
mandate
of
this
court.
we
just
don't
believe
that
either
should
be
or
is
the
law
under
continental
and
du
pont.
now,
return
to
the
things
which
were
abandoned.
the
important
issue
if
it
were
abandoned
in
this
case.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
government's
position
and
the
el
paso's
position
in
this
case,
what
we
are
saying
is,
even
if
what
i
said
in
my
hypothetical
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
was
that
even
if
you
assume
that
intervention
was
properly
denied.
we
don't
believe
under
continental
and
du
pont
that
this
court
is
powerless
and
it
is
bound
by
a
stipulated
judgment
entered
into
by
the
government
which
violates
its
mandate.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
ordered
you
divestiture
without
delay.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well
that
was
in
1964,
of
course
this
case
started
as
mr.
bennett
pointed
out
about
10
years
ago.
and
as
he
pointed
out
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
1964.
yes,
sir.
the
requirement
is
correct.
now,
what
about
the
other
abandoned
issues?
the
failure
of
divestiture
--
of
the
divestiture
decree
to
restore
the
new
company
to
the
proceeds
of
the
west
coast
transmission
company
stock
which
was
owned
by
pacific
northwest
before
the
merger.
they
are
going
to
give
the
proceeds
to
el
paso
and
in
the
connection,
el
paso
you'll
find
in
their
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief
in
reference
to
the
recently
negotiated
canadian
gas
contract
which
increases
the
price
of
gas
significantly
that
they
purport
--
intend
to
imposed
on
the
new
company.
now,
that
isn't
going
to
help
the
new
company
compete
in
california.
although,
it
may
very
well
enhance
the
value
of
the
west
coast
transmission
company
stock
which
under
this
decree
goes
to
el
paso
and
not
the
pacific
northwest
that
owned
it
before
the
merger.
they
made
unilateral
changes
in
this
decree
and
the
contracts.
every
one
of
them
to
the
disadvantaged
of
the
new
company
and
will
render
the
new
comany
less
able
to
compete
for
the
california
market.
they
also
gave
no
allocations
whatsoever
of
a
tax
law's
carry
over
benefit
of
more
than
$50
million
which
el
paso
got
because
of
pacific
northwest
tax
situation
and
which
they
used
to
their
benefit
in
the
net
about
of
about
$28
million
are
shown
by
this
record.
now
all
of
these
items
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
sir?
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well
grant
--
if
we
were
permitted
intervention
your
honor,
we
would
claim
that
we
would
have
a
right
to
litigate
the
propriety
of
requiring
as
the
government
contended
all
through
the
divestiture
hearings.
the
propriety
of
contending
that
the
ability
of
this
new
company
--
the
decree
should
be
such
as
to
restore
its
ability
to
compete
for
the
california
market
in
a
position
at
least
the
strong
as
was
the
old
company
at
the
time
the
illegal
merger.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
conform
to
the
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
conforms
to
the
mandate
of
this
court.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
i
would
think
your
honor,
if
we're
permitted
to
intervene
that
the
--
that
we
would
to
be
permitted
to
litigate
all
of
the
questions
and
issues
involved
in
reestablishing
a
new
company
that
was
as
strong
as
and
able
to
compete
for
the
california
market
as
was
the
old
company.
i
may
be
missing
the
import
of
your
question
but
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well
i
would
think,
we
would
have
the
right
to
litigate
--
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
would
think
so.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
well,
i
claim.
of
course,
that
the
matter
was
originally
sent
down
to
the
court
that
in
--
would
order
divestiture
without
delay.
now,
i
think
that
if
this
court
would
do
what
i
think
it
should
in
at
this
time
and
specify
what
factor
should
be
applied
in
this
allegation
and
how
the
matter
should
be
disposed
of.
i
think
we
could
then
be
entitled
to
litigate
the
--
all
of
the
issues
that
would
be
involved
in
assuring
our
position
as
to
how
that
mandate
should
be
complied
with.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
i
think
so
until
this
court's
mandate
would
change.
yes,
sir.
the
government
vigorously
urged
all
of
these
points
all
during
the
divestiture
case
and
the
record
in
the
case
is
the
void
of
any
explanation
to
this
extraordinary
abandonment
of
these
issues.
and
i
intended
to
discuss
them
but
i
will
simply
say
to
you
gentlemen,
that
the
reasons
which
are
given
the
explanation
if
they
may
be
called
at
which
are
given
for
the
first
time
now
in
this
brief
by
the
government.
if
you
read
them,
i'm
sure
you
will
not
be
persuaded
as
we
are
not
that
they
are
sound
explanations
and
the
important
thing
is
everything
they
talked
about
here,
they
had
available
to
them,
the
data,
the
arguments,
the
evidence
at
the
time
they
file
their
brief
after
divestiture
hearings
and
there's
nothing
new
in
this
brief
just
to
give
any
explanation
as
to
why
they
change
their
positions.
we
submit
that
this
decree
does
not
conform
with
this
court's
mandate.
we
submit
that
the
judge
have
a
completely
incorrect
understanding
of
which
--
of
what
this
court
ordered
when
it
decided
that
a
division
of
the
country
or
division
of
the
market
in
antitrust
case.
a
division
of
the
market,
one
area
to
el
paso,
one
area
to
the
new
company
couldn't
be
what
this
court
intended
and
we
submit
therefore
that
this
court
is
not
neither
powerless
to
insist
that
its
mandate
be
followed
but
they
certainly
should
do
so.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
in
fact,
i
will,
your
honor.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
if
your
honor
please.
the
main
thrust
of
our
contention
with
respect
to
non-divestiture
is
the
question
of
gas
reserves.
el
paso
proposes
to
reconstitute
and
i
use
this
word
deliberately
because
this
is
taken
out
of
the
opinion
that
this
court
handed
down
on
the
cheyanne
case
that
divestiture
means
restitution
and
el
paso
proposes
to
set
up
a
company
with
vast
new
demands
for
gas
which
had
developed
over
the
period
of
this
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
has
in
the
san
juan
alone
one
half
of
the
relative
reserves
that
it
had
relative
to
canadian
reserves
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
by
el
paso
of
the
stock.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
it
is
a
relative
concept
yes.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
at
that
time,
at
that
time,
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
had
1.95
times
the
reserves
in
san
juan
that
it
had
in
canada.
now,
el
paso
proposes
to
create
a
new
company
marginal
that
will
meet
fpc
minimum
standards
with
almost
complete
dependence
upon
canadian
reserves
and
el
paso
was
in
the
federal
power
commission
today
seeking
new
reserves
to
serve
the
pacific
northwest
not
to
serve
california
and
it
has
the
authority
to
tell
the
district
court
judge
and
now
us
that
it
is
creating
a
viable
new
entity
which
you
people,
which
this
court
found
had
been
destroyed
by
the
violation
that
is
able
to
compete
in
california.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
in
the
san
juan
basin
alone.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
yes.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
it
leaves
them
with
roughly
one-third
in
the
from
canada,
one-third
from
san
juan,
and
one-third
from
the
rocky
mountain
area
based
upon
the
figures
which
el
paso
submitted
in
the
district
court
hearing.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
it
--
it's
a
relative
manner.
we
--
we're
not
able
on
the
record
on
this
case
to
compare
the
size
of
the
reserves
in
terms
of
thousands
of
cubic
feet
because
there's
a
difference
of
method
of
measurement
in
the
long
period
of
as
to
last,
so
we
have
to
approach
it
on
the
relative
basis.
and
pacific
northwest
pipe
line
which
build
its
line,
mind
you
from
san
juan
to
the
pacific
northwest
and
still
expected
as
this
court
found
to
be
a
viable
competitor
in
california
with
dedicated
reserves
in
the
san
juan
el
paso
now
says
that
we'll
give
you
back
what
you
had
then
and
maybe
a
little
bit
more
from
fields
that
--
from
wells
which
pacific
was
developing
at
that
time
and
that's
it.
mr.
rollin
e.
woodbury
that
is
our
position.
for
example
in
the
several
years
about
four
years
following
the
acquisition
of
the
stock,
el
paso
brought
in
a
whole
new
formation
below
the
fields
where
pacific
northwest
had
been
exploring
and
developing.
and
the
figure
is
the
neighborhood
of
four
trillion
cubic
feet
and
they
do
not
propose
to
turn
this
over
to
the
new
company.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
for
one
moment
to
the
government's
contention
about
very
grave
consequences
if
these
applicants
are
not
permitted
in.
i
draw
your
honors'
attention
again
to
this
--
to
the
nature
of
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
public
service
company
that
customers
are
public
service
companies
completely
dependent
upon
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
as
to
their
future.
they
built
their
organizations.
they've
incurred
their
debt.
they've
marketed
securities
and
they
have
acquired
customers
in
the
expectation
that
their
supplier
will
be
a
company
that
has
vast
surplus
gas
reserves.
this
court
found
that
pacific
northwest
pipeline
was
such
a
company
and
we
know
that
el
paso
is
such
a
company.
now,
in
order
to
restore
that
competitive
position,
the
reserve
situation
alone
must
be
modified.
in
addition,
el
paso
seeks
to
retain
certain
other
benefits.
thank
you.
