mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
has
a
long
history
to
it
and
that
it's
necessary
to
go
into
it
to
understand
why
we
are
here
today.
it
was
in
november
8,
1956
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
el
paso
and
pacific
to
exchange
stock
and
it
was
on
may
1,
1957
to
that
exchange
agreement
was
completed.
it
took
a
mere
seven
months
to
do
that.
and
on
july
22,
1957,
the
united
states
government
filed
a
complaint
charging
that
that
stock
acquisition
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now
despite
warnings
from
the
department
of
justice
in
the
state
of
california
that
this
merger
proceeding
should
be
halted.
nonetheless,
the
el
paso
company
and
pacific
northwest
went
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
asked
that
this
merger
be
approved
and
it
was
approved.
now,
that
was
on
december
31,
1959.
there
was
an
appeal
from
that
in
a
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission.
this
court
set
aside
the
approval
by
the
federal
power
commission
saying
that
the
trial
in
utah
should
have
preceded
first.
now
the
trial
in
utah
went
forward,
judge
ritter
found
there
was
no
violation
of
section
7.
it
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
7.
now,
we
are
here
under
the
doctrine
of
the
general
motors
case
that
this
court
having
given
a
mandate
to
judge
ritter
to
the
best
without
delay
has
not
left
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
we
are
here
as
a
proper
party
in
a
proper
way
urging
that
the
divestiture
be
set
aside
at
once.
now,
that
the
divestiture
plan
requires
three
years
before
el
paso
will
writ
itself
of
pacific
northwest
and
this
is
after
they
go
to
federal
power
commission
and
seek
a
certificate
of
approval
from
that
agency.
and
this
is
hardly
a
divestiture
without
delay.
furthermore,
el
paso
is
not
making
a
complete
divestiture.
it
is
keeping
certain
properties
of
its
own
favorable
to
itself
and
is
giving
pacific
northwest
properties
less
favorable
to
that
company.
for
example,
it
is
keeping
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
which
is
a
valuable
asset
which
should
be
given
a
pacific
northwest
but
el
paso
seeks
to
retain
it.
california
sort
to
intervene
or
deny
this
for
other
appellants
here
and
we
are
here
as
we
say
under
the
theory
of
the
general
motors
case
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
review
the
judgment
below.
now,
when
you
said
that
this
should
be
done
without
delay,
we
do
not
concede
that
a
certificate
proceeding
like
the
power
commission
and
other
three
years
to
rid
itself
of
pacific
northwest
is
in
keeping
with
the
concept
without
a
delay?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
there
was
a
stipulation
between
the
united
states
of
america
and
el
paso
that
a
decree
for
the
divestiture
would
be
filed,
the
party
will
have
30
days
to
object
and
it
would
be
signed
and
that
is
what
was
done.
but
this
was
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
usa
versus
el
paso
found
that
section
7
had
been
violated.
this
was
not
a
consent
decree.
this
was
a
decree
for
divestiture
after
the
government
had
won
the
case
and
it
was
agreed
to
by
the
government.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
does
in
this
sense.
the
government
opposed
the
el
paso
plan
for
divestiture
from
the
outset
of
the
case.
if
proposed
originally
that
this
matter
be
disposed
of
by
selling
the
properties
of
specific
northwest
pipe
line
outright
to
third
party
purchasers
and
it
even
brought
forward
three
prospective
purchasers
whom
it
said
were
competent,
qualified,
willing,
and
able
to
buy
the
properties.
and
the
judge
was
not
interested
in
disposing
the
properties
in
that
way.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
quick
and
clean
in
simple
way
to
divest
these
properties
and
divest
them
completely
is
to
sell
to
competent,
qualified,
third
party
purchasers.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
was.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
is.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
at
purports
to
say
it's
satisfied
and
that
it
meets
the
mandate
of
this
court.
but
the
question
that
you
gentleman
have
to
resolve
is
whether
or
not
pacific
has
now
reconstituted
is
so
competitive
as
it
once
was
as
still
to
be
able
to
compete
for
the
california
gas
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
he
may
not
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
have
the
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
you
had
given
a
mandate.
you
had
said
divest
without
delay.
the
united
states
attorney
had
the
obligation
as
to
the
district
court
to
see
that
that
was
done.
in
this
court
upon
its
own
motion,
that
case
i
presume
or
upon
the
matter
being
brought
back
in
a
proper
way
by
someone
such
as
california
or
one
of
these
parties
would
have
ordered
that
divestiture
occurred.
because
you
said
it
du
pont
case
it
does
not
good
to
win
a
lawsuit
and
then
have
the
remedy
follow
through.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
think
they
could
attempt
to
give
up
the
whole
litigation
or
i
think
they
could
attempt
to
give
away
the
victory
which
in
our
judgment
they
did
here.
and
i
think
if
things
suspect
to
this
court
and
to
us
today
and
for
you
gentlemen
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
meant
what
you
said,
when
you
said
that
pacific
was
a
competitive
for
the
california
market
that
it
have
the
gas
reserves
so
to
do,
that
it
have
aggressive
management
and
that
it
would
undoubtedly
compete
for
the
golden
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i'm
in
the
case
as
a
would
be
intervenor
who
was
denied
and
i
have
appealed
from
the
order
of
judge
ritter
denying
intervention
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
whether
or
not,
we're
entitled
to
everything
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
if
you
read
the
general
motors
case,
you
will
find
there
that
they
--
that
you
cited
the
continental
case
which
point
out
that
when
you
give
a
mandate.
it
must
be
scrupulously
obeyed
and
if
it
is
not
and
if
it
is
brought
to
your
attention
in
any
proper
way,
and
note
you
did
not
say
by
a
proper
party,
you
said
a
proper
way
that
then
you
would
have
jurisdiction
to
take
the
thing
over
and
see
that
your
mandate
was
obeyed.
or
you
could
it
on
your
own
motion
whether
anybody
else
put
it
up
to
you
or
not.
its
you
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
representation
of
the
government
was
adequate
and
if
our
view
that
it
was
not
adequate
as
in
correction
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
aside
from
the
history
of
it,
your
honors.
we
think
that
california
was
entitled
to
intervene
simply
because
of
the
facts
that
the
representation
of
the
public
interest
by
the
government
abruptly
seized.
the
case
was
tried
upon
the
theory
that
the
el
paso
divestiture
plan
was
deficient
and
the
government
so
specify,
its
so
argued,
its
so
briefed,
it
put
in
a
proposed
decree
on
its
own
which
called
for
an
outright
sale
the
third
parties.
now
at
that
point,
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the
government
seized
to
represent
the
public
interest
which
would
include
california
and
would
include
the
mandate
of
this
court
then
we
have
a
right
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
representation
to
become
a
party
to
protect
our
interest
on
the
interest
in
this
case
so
far
as
california
is
concerned
as
the
gas
consuming
public
and
the
necessity
of
our
competition
for
the
natural
gas
pipeline
market
of
california.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
don't
think
we
have
to
use
words
such
as
bad
faith
or
malfeasance
or
neglect
of
duty.
a
man
can
make
a
mistake
honestly
and
a
government
official
such
as
myself
can
make
a
mistake
honestly.
but
if
it's
a
mistake
then
redress
must
be
held.
now,
what
was
the
mistake
here?
when
this
was
argued
in
1962
in
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission,
the
solicitor
general
standing
before
you
said,
that
they
were
seeking
out
there
in
utah,
complete
divestiture.
that's
what
the
complaint
asked
for.
that
meant
that
you
have
to
give
back
to
the
new
company
as
you
constituted
it,
sufficient
gas
reserves
as
it
once
had
to
be
competitive
to
the
california
market.
that
you
have
to
return
to
it,
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
which
it
owned,
which
was
with
value
of
asset
to
it.
that
you
had
to
leave
alone
the
gathering
charge
in
the
san
juan
basin
rather
than
increasing
it
and
that
el
paso
when
you
said
divest
must
divest
completely
all
that
it
take
in
pacific
northwest
and
not
keep
the
favorable
proper
producing
property
which
it
has
done
in
this
case.
and
in
20
minutes,
i
can't
go
into
particulars
of
that.
but
that's
the
kind
of
divestiture
decree
which
came
out.
now,
i'm
not
charging
any
malfeasance
or
fraudulent
conduct
upon
the
part
of
the
government.
i'm
saying
if
the
government
failed
to
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court,
and
to
follow
the
language
of
united
states
of
america
versus
el
paso
natural
gas
company
where
you
said
there
was
a
necessity
for
competition
that
the
acquisition
of
the
pacific
tended
to
lessen
that
tenancy.
and
you
said,
put
it
back
in
a
position
where
it
can
still
compete
for
the
california
market.
now
that
so
constituted
today
that
it's
less
competitive
than
it
was,
and
it
was
independent,
you're
mandate
is
not
been
met
and
the
government
as
you
said
in
the
general
motors
case
has
won
the
lawsuit
but
lost
the
cause
ultimately
and
that's
what
is
happening
here.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
because
the
government
failed
to
follow
what
your
mandate
which
made
their
--
the
result
inadequate
because
of
the
inadequate
insistence
upon
a
decree
meeting
your
mandate.
and
therefore,
the
inadequacy
comes
out
quite
apparently
and
if
it
were
not
for
california
and
these
parties.
this
case
wouldn't
be
back
here
today.
it
means
if
we
can't
come
back
here
under
the
doctrine
of
the
general
motors
case
that
anything
could
have
been
done
below
even
perpetuating
the
unlawful
merger
here
and
unless
somebody
spoke
back
to
this
court.
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
according
to
the
government's
theory.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
your
honors,
in
the
approximately
four
minutes
remaining.
i'd
like
to
point
this
out.
that
you
said
in
du
pont
that
where
you
had
formulated
a
judgment
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
that
you
have
plenary
power
to
supervised
that
judgment
and
that
if
it
were
brought
back
to
your
attention
in
a
proper
way.
you
had
jurisdiction
to
take
the
cause
over
if
the
decree
were
not
issue
as
you
had
contemplated
it
should
be.
now
of
course,
it's
our
position
the
decree
does
not
meet
the
mandate
of
this
court.
it's
our
position
we're
here
in
a
proper
way.
it's
our
position
that
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
question
of
intervention
under
rule
24
that
we're
here
under
the
doctrine
of
continental
and
du
pont.
but
if
we
do
have
to
come
before
this
court
as
party,
we
maintain
that
we
were
entitled
to
intervene
because
when
the
government
abandoned
its
antitrust
position
before
judge
ritter
and
went
for
the
decree
of
el
paso
natural
gas
company
at
that
moment,
the
representation
of
the
public
interests,
the
mandate
of
this
court,
the
interest
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
consumers
of
california
that
interest
became
inadequate
and
somebody
was
entitled
to
represent
those
parties
in
a
particular
california
was
entitled
to
representation,
therefore,
its
gas
consumers.
now,
we
have
to
wait
throughout
the
trial
until
such
time
as
the
government
switched
positions
before
we
knew
that
the
representation
was
inadequate.
and
when
they
use
the
word
“inadequate”
or
“failure
to
meet
the
mandate”
whatever
term
you
wish
to
style
it,
it
was
not,
what
this
court
said
you
want
it
done
when
you
said
restore
pacific
to
a
competitive
position
for
the
california
market.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
attorney
general
of
the
california
has
authorized
me
to
come
back
and
represent
the
state
of
california
and
he's
paying
for
my
travel
expenses.
although,
i
heard
in
the
radio
last
night
that
the
new
administration
in
california
has
cutoff
all
travel
expenses
for
out-of-state
visits.
so,
i'm
here
as
a
lawyer
without
a
staff,
without
a
petroleum
engineer
even
a
bookkeeper.
this
case
is
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california.
that
was
confirmed
by
telephone
call
to
me
--
from
me
to
him
just
before
i
left.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
has
--
the
attorney
general
was
reelect
--
the
attorney,
same
attorney
general
but
other
significant
changes
in
our
state.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
i
presume
i
can
get
back
by
greyhound
bus
if
no
other
way.
and
as
i
see
the
court
is
aware
there
have
been
difficulties
in
this
case
before
as
california
is
position
is
concerned
and
i
can't
talk
about
the
merits
of
the
decree.
but
the
decree
as
agreed
to
by
the
government
sets
up
a
new
corporation
weaker
than
pacific
was
when
it
was
independent.
it
is
nothing
but
a
delaying
tactic.
it
will
take
two
or
more
years
to
get
through
the
federal
power
commission
and
then
and
only
then
does
the
stock
exchange
at
el
paso
proposed
attempt
to
be
done
with
its
own
shareholders
and
if
that
fails
a
public
offering.
and
against
that,
merely
think
of
the
fact
that
the
government
at
one
time
said,
the
best
way
to
dispose
of
this
and
to
make
it
independent
is
an
outright
sale
to
third
parties.
and
this
selling
in
an
existing
pipeline
is
something
like
selling
in
existing
bank.
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
doing
that
and
this
court
then
has
to
be
very
specific
in
its
instructions
to
judge
ritter
and
i
prefer
you
send
it
to
a
master
as
to
what
he
must
do
and
as
to
how
he
must
do
it.
and
there's
must
be
some
time
limitations
put
upon
it
because
i
question
very
much
that
i
will
be
back
before
judge
ritter
if
this
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
i
think
this
court
has
a
challenge
presented
to
it
by
the
violator
of
the
clayton
act,
el
paso
as
to
whether
or
not
your
mandate
is
to
be
respected
or
as
to
whether
or
not
there
version
of
what
compliance
that
your
mandate
means.
there's
a
clear
challenge
here
as
i
view
it
and
i
think
the
court
is
being
tests
as
to
whether
or
not
we've
won
the
case
but
lost
the
cause.
and
i
think
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
enunciate
quite
clearly
if
judge
ritter
with
some
strict
guidelines
and
limitations
as
to
what
he
must
do
if
you
dissented
there.
you
see
there
is
so
many
unanswered
questions
in
this
case
because
we
were
not
allowed
to
intervene.
questions
about
gas
reserves,
capital
structure,
why
they're
keeping
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
which
was
a
valuable
assets
to
the
new
company.
why
the
new
company
only
has
$250.00
of
working
capital?
why
it
has
a
capital
structure
75%
debt
and
25%
equity.
all
of
these
things
were
resolved
in
chambers
or
by
the
government
but
nobody
else
was
allowed
to
participate
and
the
government
in
its
brief
concedes
this
is
a
complex
difficult
question.
but
it's
gotten
to
be
difficult
complex
situation
at
is
because
el
paso
persisted
despite
repeated
warnings
in
violating
the
clayton
act.
and
this
violation
of
the
clayton
act
has
being
going
on
now
since
1956
and
it
goes
on
as
i
stand
here
today.
and
the
california
market
requires
and
the
west
requires
that
you
restore
pacific
to
what
it
wants
once
when
it
was
able
to
compete
with
el
paso
for
the
california
gas
market
and
even
made
negotiations
of
edison
to
bring
gas
to
southern
california.
and
when
that
occurred,
el
paso
came
in
and
made
a
very
much
better
attractive
lower
offer
just
to
keep
pacific
out
of
california
gas
market.
el
paso
has
selected
the
management
of
this
company
for
example.
el
paso
is
picking
the
best
assets
for
itself.
el
paso
is
presenting
to
the
federal
power
commission,
the
case
on
behalf
of
a
new
company.
it's
financing
it.
it's
preparing
it.
it's
presenting
it.
now,
compare
that
against
a
group
of
fires
wherever
they
maybe
i'm
no
expert
in
finance
who
would
bid
for
this
company
and
would
go
in
before
the
power
commission
and
make
an
adversary
showing
against
el
paso.
the
same
attorneys,
the
same
people
that
put
this
merger
together
are
now
presenting
the
application
of
a
new
pipeline
company
to
the
federal
power
commission.
let's
not
calculate
it
to
suit
the
best
public
interest
as
i
see
it.
it
will
be
at
least
five
years
before
this
merger
is
concluded
unless
this
court
directs
that
some
prompt
action
be
taken.
and
the
best
way
i
know
of
doing
it
is
to
do
as
the
government
once
said
in
its
proposed
decree
which
was
lodged
but
not
filed
for
some
reason,
invite
deeds
from
interested
third
parties.
now,
i'm
intruding
upon
mr.
hooper's
time,
if
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
will
conclude.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
has
a
long
history
to
it
and
that
it's
necessary
to
go
into
it
to
understand
why
we
are
here
today.
it
was
in
november
8,
1956
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
el
paso
and
pacific
to
exchange
stock
and
it
was
on
may
1,
1957
to
that
exchange
agreement
was
completed.
it
took
a
mere
seven
months
to
do
that.
and
on
july
22,
1957,
the
united
states
government
filed
a
complaint
charging
that
that
stock
acquisition
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now
despite
warnings
from
the
department
of
justice
in
the
state
of
california
that
this
merger
proceeding
should
be
halted.
nonetheless,
the
el
paso
company
and
pacific
northwest
went
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
asked
that
this
merger
be
approved
and
it
was
approved.
now,
that
was
on
december
31,
1959.
there
was
an
appeal
from
that
in
a
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission.
this
court
set
aside
the
approval
by
the
federal
power
commission
saying
that
the
trial
in
utah
should
have
preceded
first.
now
the
trial
in
utah
went
forward,
judge
ritter
found
there
was
no
violation
of
section
7.
it
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
7.
now,
we
are
here
under
the
doctrine
of
the
general
motors
case
that
this
court
having
given
a
mandate
to
judge
ritter
to
the
best
without
delay
has
not
left
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
we
are
here
as
a
proper
party
in
a
proper
way
urging
that
the
divestiture
be
set
aside
at
once.
now,
that
the
divestiture
plan
requires
three
years
before
el
paso
will
writ
itself
of
pacific
northwest
and
this
is
after
they
go
to
federal
power
commission
and
seek
a
certificate
of
approval
from
that
agency.
and
this
is
hardly
a
divestiture
without
delay.
furthermore,
el
paso
is
not
making
a
complete
divestiture.
it
is
keeping
certain
properties
of
its
own
favorable
to
itself
and
is
giving
pacific
northwest
properties
less
favorable
to
that
company.
for
example,
it
is
keeping
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
which
is
a
valuable
asset
which
should
be
given
a
pacific
northwest
but
el
paso
seeks
to
retain
it.
california
sort
to
intervene
or
deny
this
for
other
appellants
here
and
we
are
here
as
we
say
under
the
theory
of
the
general
motors
case
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
review
the
judgment
below.
now,
when
you
said
that
this
should
be
done
without
delay,
we
do
not
concede
that
a
certificate
proceeding
like
the
power
commission
and
other
three
years
to
rid
itself
of
pacific
northwest
is
in
keeping
with
the
concept
without
a
delay?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
bennett
there
was
a
stipulation
between
the
united
states
of
america
and
el
paso
that
a
decree
for
the
divestiture
would
be
filed,
the
party
will
have
30
days
to
object
and
it
would
be
signed
and
that
is
what
was
done.
but
this
was
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
usa
versus
el
paso
found
that
section
7
had
been
violated.
this
was
not
a
consent
decree.
this
was
a
decree
for
divestiture
after
the
government
had
won
the
case
and
it
was
agreed
to
by
the
government.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
does
in
this
sense.
the
government
opposed
the
el
paso
plan
for
divestiture
from
the
outset
of
the
case.
if
proposed
originally
that
this
matter
be
disposed
of
by
selling
the
properties
of
specific
northwest
pipe
line
outright
to
third
party
purchasers
and
it
even
brought
forward
three
prospective
purchasers
whom
it
said
were
competent,
qualified,
willing,
and
able
to
buy
the
properties.
and
the
judge
was
not
interested
in
disposing
the
properties
in
that
way.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
quick
and
clean
in
simple
way
to
divest
these
properties
and
divest
them
completely
is
to
sell
to
competent,
qualified,
third
party
purchasers.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
was.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
is.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
at
purports
to
say
it's
satisfied
and
that
it
meets
the
mandate
of
this
court.
but
the
question
that
you
gentleman
have
to
resolve
is
whether
or
not
pacific
has
now
reconstituted
is
so
competitive
as
it
once
was
as
still
to
be
able
to
compete
for
the
california
gas
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
he
may
not
go
back
to
the
district
court
to
have
the
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
you
had
given
a
mandate.
you
had
said
divest
without
delay.
the
united
states
attorney
had
the
obligation
as
to
the
district
court
to
see
that
that
was
done.
in
this
court
upon
its
own
motion,
that
case
i
presume
or
upon
the
matter
being
brought
back
in
a
proper
way
by
someone
such
as
california
or
one
of
these
parties
would
have
ordered
that
divestiture
occurred.
because
you
said
it
du
pont
case
it
does
not
good
to
win
a
lawsuit
and
then
have
the
remedy
follow
through.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
think
they
could
attempt
to
give
up
the
whole
litigation
or
i
think
they
could
attempt
to
give
away
the
victory
which
in
our
judgment
they
did
here.
and
i
think
if
things
suspect
to
this
court
and
to
us
today
and
for
you
gentlemen
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
meant
what
you
said,
when
you
said
that
pacific
was
a
competitive
for
the
california
market
that
it
have
the
gas
reserves
so
to
do,
that
it
have
aggressive
management
and
that
it
would
undoubtedly
compete
for
the
golden
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i'm
in
the
case
as
a
would
be
intervenor
who
was
denied
and
i
have
appealed
from
the
order
of
judge
ritter
denying
intervention
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
whether
or
not,
we're
entitled
to
everything
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
if
you
read
the
general
motors
case,
you
will
find
there
that
they
--
that
you
cited
the
continental
case
which
point
out
that
when
you
give
a
mandate.
it
must
be
scrupulously
obeyed
and
if
it
is
not
and
if
it
is
brought
to
your
attention
in
any
proper
way,
and
note
you
did
not
say
by
a
proper
party,
you
said
a
proper
way
that
then
you
would
have
jurisdiction
to
take
the
thing
over
and
see
that
your
mandate
was
obeyed.
or
you
could
it
on
your
own
motion
whether
anybody
else
put
it
up
to
you
or
not.
its
you
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
representation
of
the
government
was
adequate
and
if
our
view
that
it
was
not
adequate
as
in
correction
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
aside
from
the
history
of
it,
your
honors.
we
think
that
california
was
entitled
to
intervene
simply
because
of
the
facts
that
the
representation
of
the
public
interest
by
the
government
abruptly
seized.
the
case
was
tried
upon
the
theory
that
the
el
paso
divestiture
plan
was
deficient
and
the
government
so
specify,
its
so
argued,
its
so
briefed,
it
put
in
a
proposed
decree
on
its
own
which
called
for
an
outright
sale
the
third
parties.
now
at
that
point,
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the
government
seized
to
represent
the
public
interest
which
would
include
california
and
would
include
the
mandate
of
this
court
then
we
have
a
right
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
representation
to
become
a
party
to
protect
our
interest
on
the
interest
in
this
case
so
far
as
california
is
concerned
as
the
gas
consuming
public
and
the
necessity
of
our
competition
for
the
natural
gas
pipeline
market
of
california.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
don't
think
we
have
to
use
words
such
as
bad
faith
or
malfeasance
or
neglect
of
duty.
a
man
can
make
a
mistake
honestly
and
a
government
official
such
as
myself
can
make
a
mistake
honestly.
but
if
it's
a
mistake
then
redress
must
be
held.
now,
what
was
the
mistake
here?
when
this
was
argued
in
1962
in
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission,
the
solicitor
general
standing
before
you
said,
that
they
were
seeking
out
there
in
utah,
complete
divestiture.
that's
what
the
complaint
asked
for.
that
meant
that
you
have
to
give
back
to
the
new
company
as
you
constituted
it,
sufficient
gas
reserves
as
it
once
had
to
be
competitive
to
the
california
market.
that
you
have
to
return
to
it,
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
which
it
owned,
which
was
with
value
of
asset
to
it.
that
you
had
to
leave
alone
the
gathering
charge
in
the
san
juan
basin
rather
than
increasing
it
and
that
el
paso
when
you
said
divest
must
divest
completely
all
that
it
take
in
pacific
northwest
and
not
keep
the
favorable
proper
producing
property
which
it
has
done
in
this
case.
and
in
20
minutes,
i
can't
go
into
particulars
of
that.
but
that's
the
kind
of
divestiture
decree
which
came
out.
now,
i'm
not
charging
any
malfeasance
or
fraudulent
conduct
upon
the
part
of
the
government.
i'm
saying
if
the
government
failed
to
follow
the
mandate
of
this
court,
and
to
follow
the
language
of
united
states
of
america
versus
el
paso
natural
gas
company
where
you
said
there
was
a
necessity
for
competition
that
the
acquisition
of
the
pacific
tended
to
lessen
that
tenancy.
and
you
said,
put
it
back
in
a
position
where
it
can
still
compete
for
the
california
market.
now
that
so
constituted
today
that
it's
less
competitive
than
it
was,
and
it
was
independent,
you're
mandate
is
not
been
met
and
the
government
as
you
said
in
the
general
motors
case
has
won
the
lawsuit
but
lost
the
cause
ultimately
and
that's
what
is
happening
here.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
because
the
government
failed
to
follow
what
your
mandate
which
made
their
--
the
result
inadequate
because
of
the
inadequate
insistence
upon
a
decree
meeting
your
mandate.
and
therefore,
the
inadequacy
comes
out
quite
apparently
and
if
it
were
not
for
california
and
these
parties.
this
case
wouldn't
be
back
here
today.
it
means
if
we
can't
come
back
here
under
the
doctrine
of
the
general
motors
case
that
anything
could
have
been
done
below
even
perpetuating
the
unlawful
merger
here
and
unless
somebody
spoke
back
to
this
court.
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
according
to
the
government's
theory.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
your
honors,
in
the
approximately
four
minutes
remaining.
i'd
like
to
point
this
out.
that
you
said
in
du
pont
that
where
you
had
formulated
a
judgment
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
that
you
have
plenary
power
to
supervised
that
judgment
and
that
if
it
were
brought
back
to
your
attention
in
a
proper
way.
you
had
jurisdiction
to
take
the
cause
over
if
the
decree
were
not
issue
as
you
had
contemplated
it
should
be.
now
of
course,
it's
our
position
the
decree
does
not
meet
the
mandate
of
this
court.
it's
our
position
we're
here
in
a
proper
way.
it's
our
position
that
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
question
of
intervention
under
rule
24
that
we're
here
under
the
doctrine
of
continental
and
du
pont.
but
if
we
do
have
to
come
before
this
court
as
party,
we
maintain
that
we
were
entitled
to
intervene
because
when
the
government
abandoned
its
antitrust
position
before
judge
ritter
and
went
for
the
decree
of
el
paso
natural
gas
company
at
that
moment,
the
representation
of
the
public
interests,
the
mandate
of
this
court,
the
interest
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
consumers
of
california
that
interest
became
inadequate
and
somebody
was
entitled
to
represent
those
parties
in
a
particular
california
was
entitled
to
representation,
therefore,
its
gas
consumers.
now,
we
have
to
wait
throughout
the
trial
until
such
time
as
the
government
switched
positions
before
we
knew
that
the
representation
was
inadequate.
and
when
they
use
the
word
“inadequate”
or
“failure
to
meet
the
mandate”
whatever
term
you
wish
to
style
it,
it
was
not,
what
this
court
said
you
want
it
done
when
you
said
restore
pacific
to
a
competitive
position
for
the
california
market.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
attorney
general
of
the
california
has
authorized
me
to
come
back
and
represent
the
state
of
california
and
he's
paying
for
my
travel
expenses.
although,
i
heard
in
the
radio
last
night
that
the
new
administration
in
california
has
cutoff
all
travel
expenses
for
out-of-state
visits.
so,
i'm
here
as
a
lawyer
without
a
staff,
without
a
petroleum
engineer
even
a
bookkeeper.
this
case
is
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california.
that
was
confirmed
by
telephone
call
to
me
--
from
me
to
him
just
before
i
left.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
has
--
the
attorney
general
was
reelect
--
the
attorney,
same
attorney
general
but
other
significant
changes
in
our
state.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
i
presume
i
can
get
back
by
greyhound
bus
if
no
other
way.
and
as
i
see
the
court
is
aware
there
have
been
difficulties
in
this
case
before
as
california
is
position
is
concerned
and
i
can't
talk
about
the
merits
of
the
decree.
but
the
decree
as
agreed
to
by
the
government
sets
up
a
new
corporation
weaker
than
pacific
was
when
it
was
independent.
it
is
nothing
but
a
delaying
tactic.
it
will
take
two
or
more
years
to
get
through
the
federal
power
commission
and
then
and
only
then
does
the
stock
exchange
at
el
paso
proposed
attempt
to
be
done
with
its
own
shareholders
and
if
that
fails
a
public
offering.
and
against
that,
merely
think
of
the
fact
that
the
government
at
one
time
said,
the
best
way
to
dispose
of
this
and
to
make
it
independent
is
an
outright
sale
to
third
parties.
and
this
selling
in
an
existing
pipeline
is
something
like
selling
in
existing
bank.
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
doing
that
and
this
court
then
has
to
be
very
specific
in
its
instructions
to
judge
ritter
and
i
prefer
you
send
it
to
a
master
as
to
what
he
must
do
and
as
to
how
he
must
do
it.
and
there's
must
be
some
time
limitations
put
upon
it
because
i
question
very
much
that
i
will
be
back
before
judge
ritter
if
this
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
i
think
this
court
has
a
challenge
presented
to
it
by
the
violator
of
the
clayton
act,
el
paso
as
to
whether
or
not
your
mandate
is
to
be
respected
or
as
to
whether
or
not
there
version
of
what
compliance
that
your
mandate
means.
there's
a
clear
challenge
here
as
i
view
it
and
i
think
the
court
is
being
tests
as
to
whether
or
not
we've
won
the
case
but
lost
the
cause.
and
i
think
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
enunciate
quite
clearly
if
judge
ritter
with
some
strict
guidelines
and
limitations
as
to
what
he
must
do
if
you
dissented
there.
you
see
there
is
so
many
unanswered
questions
in
this
case
because
we
were
not
allowed
to
intervene.
questions
about
gas
reserves,
capital
structure,
why
they're
keeping
the
west
coast
transmission
stock
which
was
a
valuable
assets
to
the
new
company.
why
the
new
company
only
has
$250.00
of
working
capital?
why
it
has
a
capital
structure
75%
debt
and
25%
equity.
all
of
these
things
were
resolved
in
chambers
or
by
the
government
but
nobody
else
was
allowed
to
participate
and
the
government
in
its
brief
concedes
this
is
a
complex
difficult
question.
but
it's
gotten
to
be
difficult
complex
situation
at
is
because
el
paso
persisted
despite
repeated
warnings
in
violating
the
clayton
act.
and
this
violation
of
the
clayton
act
has
being
going
on
now
since
1956
and
it
goes
on
as
i
stand
here
today.
and
the
california
market
requires
and
the
west
requires
that
you
restore
pacific
to
what
it
wants
once
when
it
was
able
to
compete
with
el
paso
for
the
california
gas
market
and
even
made
negotiations
of
edison
to
bring
gas
to
southern
california.
and
when
that
occurred,
el
paso
came
in
and
made
a
very
much
better
attractive
lower
offer
just
to
keep
pacific
out
of
california
gas
market.
el
paso
has
selected
the
management
of
this
company
for
example.
el
paso
is
picking
the
best
assets
for
itself.
el
paso
is
presenting
to
the
federal
power
commission,
the
case
on
behalf
of
a
new
company.
it's
financing
it.
it's
preparing
it.
it's
presenting
it.
now,
compare
that
against
a
group
of
fires
wherever
they
maybe
i'm
no
expert
in
finance
who
would
bid
for
this
company
and
would
go
in
before
the
power
commission
and
make
an
adversary
showing
against
el
paso.
the
same
attorneys,
the
same
people
that
put
this
merger
together
are
now
presenting
the
application
of
a
new
pipeline
company
to
the
federal
power
commission.
let's
not
calculate
it
to
suit
the
best
public
interest
as
i
see
it.
it
will
be
at
least
five
years
before
this
merger
is
concluded
unless
this
court
directs
that
some
prompt
action
be
taken.
and
the
best
way
i
know
of
doing
it
is
to
do
as
the
government
once
said
in
its
proposed
decree
which
was
lodged
but
not
filed
for
some
reason,
invite
deeds
from
interested
third
parties.
now,
i'm
intruding
upon
mr.
hooper's
time,
if
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
will
conclude.
thank
you,
your
honors.
