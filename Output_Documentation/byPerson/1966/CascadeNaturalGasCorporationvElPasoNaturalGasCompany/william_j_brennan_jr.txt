justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
woodbury,
are
you
going
to
argue
the
intervention
to
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
don't
have
to
resolve
that
before
we
get
to
the
merits
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
argument
that
you're
entitle
of
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
discretionary
interventions
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
you
see
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
in
the
original
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
in
the
original
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
woodbury,
am
i
right,
the
question
of
adequacy
of
representation
goes
to
discretionary
intervention
does
it
rather
than
to
universal
division
of
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
it
goes
both,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
--
let's
assume
as
i
suggest
to
mr.
bennett,
they
stipulate
for
the
dismissal
of
the
litigation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
example,
we
may
decide,
issues
here
which
nevertheless
result
in
a
settlement
between
the
parties
on
a
different
basis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
of
course
the
government
was
still
insisting
that
there
was
a
public
interest
of
require
indication.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
i
put
it
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
i
have
chief
justice
taft's
opinion
in
the
continental
case.
do
i
correctly
read
this
as
a
case
in
which
you
certainly
said
what
you
have
been
relying
on
mainly
that
this
court
can
as
plenary
power
where
the
compliance
so
if
would
be
attempted
in
the
decree
in
any
proper
way
brought
forward
attention.
that's
what
i
think
you're
relying
on
this
instant.
but
in
that
instance,
the
initial
suit
which
was
united
states
versus
redding
(ph)
company
resulted
in
the
proceeding
in
the
district
court
that
was
what
was
sent
for
the
district
court
into
our
mandate.
and
then
the
intervenor
of
continental
insurance
company
was
an
intervenor
and
no
one
seems
to
have
challenged
the
continental
and
the
other
intervenors
the
right
to
intervene
or
any
event
they
were
allowed
to
intervene,
and
then
they
brought
the
decree
as
intervenors
in
the
district
court
proceeding
here.
but
your
situation
as
you
stand
here
in
any
event
is
that
you've
been
denied
intervention
in
the
district
court
and
can
you
read
continental
as
saying
that
you're
entitled
to
be
here
merely
because
chief
justice
taft
said
in
any
proper
way
when
you're
not
going
to
allow
to
intercede
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
might
correct
this
for
the
facts
of
continental?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
course
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
been
in
the
district
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
course
in
du
pont,
the
united
states
is
the
(voice
overlap)
brought
the
decree
back
here,
wasn't
it?
and
didn't
what
we
say
in
the
du
pont
really
go
to
the
question
once
we
have
the
case
properly
here
because
a
party
entitled
to
bring
it
here
had
voted
here
that
then
we
were
free
to
enter
whatever
we
thought
was
required
by
the
mandate
in
the
previous
sit.
does
it
go
beyond
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
it
does.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
may
ask
this
if
you're
right
about
this,
does
it
follow
that
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
unhappy
with
this
decree's
post
cascade
and
california
and
edison
were
content
but
some
citizen
of
california
was
upset
about
it,
that
he
come
up
here
and
has
this
thing
to
say
that
the
district
court
have
not
complied
with
our
mandate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
recall
we
have
case
to
a
couple
of
years
ago
some
town,
copeland
or
something
like
that.
they
were
not
parties
to
this.
but
suppose
they
were
unhappy
because
they
thought
the
supply
the
were
going
to
get
for
their
municipal
power
is
going
to
cost
them
or
now
and
everyone
else
is
content
with
what
happen
with
this
court
and
they
came
up
here
and
ask
this
to
look
at
this
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
illustrate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--from
a
denial
of
motion
to
intervene.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
very
least,
if
we
agree
with
you.
we
are
going
beyond
anything
we
have
done
yet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
we
are
going
beyond
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
situations
in
continental
certainly,
aren't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.

are
you
going
