justice
tom
c.
clark
but
your
--
you
got
to
show
surely
first
that
the
--
your
denial
of
intervention
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
court.
you're
not
here
as
an
amicus.
you're
here
as
a
party
claims
that
they
have
right
to
contest
the
decree
despite
the
government's
agreement
with
it.
that's
that
your
first
question,
isn't
it?
if
you
have
no
right
to
intervene,
you
have
everything
you
say
to
decide
the
point.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
why
don't
you
address
yourself
to
the
intervention
question
for
this?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
the
government
didn't
withdraw
from
case.
it
didn't
withdraw
from
the
divestiture
decree.
it
negotiated.
it
ended
up
with
the
result
that
it
was
satisfied
with,
now
are
you
charging
the
government
was
acting
in
bad
faith
somewhat?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
if
we
reach
that
point
first
that
if
since
the
thing
is
here
for
the
--
for
adjudication,
i
read
the
continental
as
meaning
that
we
could
under
our
own
motion?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
maybe
we
should
on
own
our
motion
then?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
they
have
new
precedent?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
mean
you
think
pertaining
there
in
the
amendment
relates
to
pending
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
do
the
case
may
be
after
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
imply
a
concession
with
the
amended
rule
applied
when
the
district
court
was
on?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
settle
all
of
those
--
i
suppose
all
70%
before
they
ever
get
to
this
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
no,
but
you
don't
--
heretofore
settled
any
case
after
this
court
has
said
he
should
do
it?
