justice

l.
black
can
you
claim
that
you
have
the
right

litigate
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
the
right
to
litigate
to
decide
whether
the
decree
would
be
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
they
just
inform
the
mandate
of
the
court
with
no
right
to
litigate
at
all,
(inaudible)
position
to
stay
in,
a
reason
of
the
government
to
stand
its
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
(inaudible)
would
then
indicate
to
the
government's
position
to
litigate
the
(inaudible).
what
--
what
do
you
have
to
litigate
then
if
you
were
allowed
to
litigate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
this
decree
has
to
be
followed
by
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
chance
to
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
divestiture
must
be
out
at
all
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
if
they
had
not
make
the
case
also
if
the
case
is
here
but
assume
that
the
court's
decision
is
suppose
to
be
obeyed
and
it
is
also
limited.
but
prove
inadequate
representation
at
that
time,
why
could
this
court
not
consider
that
is
not
necessary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
to
--
you
wanted
to
dispose
of
before
you
have
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
were
not
to
be
obtained
until
--
for
someone
else?
this
court
is
also
concerned
with
dispositions
they
made.
there
are
other
people
interested
in
sub,
however
ordinarily
they
would
not
care
of
that.
but
the
person
who
was
on
the
record
did
not
adequately
represent
the
problem
and
that
came
before
this
court
and
assumed
the
proper
mandates.
why
should
the
court
not
have
a
right
to
enforce
to
take
such
steps
that
were
necessary
to
see
that
its
procedures
carried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
goes
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
without
power
even
when
it's
brought
(inaudible)
because
without
the
power
they
let
it
on
decree
to
(inaudible)
of
the
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
i
would
--
and
i
think
the
controversies
he
knows
what
it
is
but
call
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
it
investigated
in
the
--
but
failure
to
carry
out
the
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
he
arose
the
confusion
of
rolling
evidence
if
the
court
will
take
to
protect
its
own
decree.
when
somebody
that
full
support
of
one
person
or
another,
how
cane
he
raised
this
question
and
charges
that
this
proceeding
is
not
a
charge
to
the
envy
of
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
the
question
finally
comes
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
will
this
question
finally
end?
the
charge
here,
by
people
who
are
here
bought
it,
trying
to
get
a
lead
that
the
government
has
thrown
the
public
interest
out,
calling
it
to
our
attention
nobody
litigate
like
in
the
court
below.
what
they
want
and
firmly
is
that
it
litigate
even
court
below
as
someone
other
than
the
government
may
claim
that
(inaudible)
against.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

right
to
complain
in
this
court
give
us
all
from
us
were
saying
something
--
something
even
though
they
may
not
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
long
as
that
as
their
statement
down
the
shadow
was
absolutely
true
opposite
and
this
court
concede
that
the
decree
in
its
order
to
be
taken
out.
not
any
interest
between
the
government
but
neither
to
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
government
had
an
end?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
big
brother
doing
bad
faith,
i'd
have
been
adjudicated
by
this
court.
the
public
has
the
right
to
ask
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
if
now
they
stated
to
form
a
unit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
you
say
all
--
do
you
say
give
that
to
public
as
it
have
been
adjudicated
by
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
deny
it?
if
you
ever
get
--
if
you
don't
want
to
get
the
way
you
have
to
get
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
said
it
would
have
given
up
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
on
all
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
wondering
when
did
the
government
change
its
position
as
to
the
advocacy
of
the
divestiture
and
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
complete
separation
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
at
that
time
they
have
made
a
stipulation
that
it
has
already
been
decreed
by
this
court,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
immediately,
without
delay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
not
a
settlement
of
an
antitrust
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
settlement
where
that
one
side
charges
that
the
other
is
not
trying
to
bring
about
a
complete
division
to
this
court
order.
that's
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
charged
is
if
you're
not
doing
what
we
told
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
bad
faith.
i
don't
care
about
all
those
adjectives.
what
is
in
issue
here
between
you
and
them?
they
say
you
have
succumbed
to
some
kind
of
settlement
which
is
not
complete
divestiture?
now
why
shouldn't
that
be
tried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
to
do
something
lesser
--
if
that's
what
you
mean,
well
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
claiming
is
the
right
not
to
bring
it
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
divestiture
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you're
claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
issue
of
fact.
that
they
have
sought
the
right
to
have
to
determine
why
should
they
have
the
right
to
have
it
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
not
just
settle
a
case,
there's
a
big
broad
term.
what
the
settlement
they
claim
you
have
made
herein
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
they
claim
wrongly
is
that
you
have
settled
in
a
way
that
defeats
the
object
of
this
court
to
bring
about
a
complete
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that's
not
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
divestiture
except
divestiture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
issue
of
fact
and
they
say
that
hasn't
been
--
that's
not
true
and
you
say,
well,
whether
it's
true
or
not
makes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
settle
the
case?
i
attempted
to
suggest
mr.
justice
that
the
reason
i
gave
the
description
of
what
the
settlement
negotiations
involved,
and
the
basis
on
which
we
settled
i
attempted
to
do
that
to
show
the
factors
which
led
the
attorney
general
into
settling
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
the
right
way.
it's
not
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
complete
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
like
this,
would
it?
in
here,
divestiture
has
been
ordered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
any
question
in
event
would
indicate
in
such
position
as
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
think
about
of
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
probably
be
so
frivolous
that
the
court
has
not
passed
any
attention
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
is
so
far
from
frivolous
that
the
government
found
in
keeping
having
the
facts
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
malfeasance
is
an
absolute
before
anything
can
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
right
and
you
have
settled
on
the
basis
which
does
not
bring
about
complete
divestiture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
shouldn't
the
court
have
some
way
to
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
if
they
give
the
case
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
the
best
way
to
do
that
would
be
to
try
it
out,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
serious
enough
to
justify
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
bring
about
a
complete
divestiture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
courts
in
two
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
an
independent
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
would
not
be
a
complete
divestiture,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
be
enough
evidence
in
the
record
for
us
to
determine
that
one
way
or
the
other
or
would
that
have
to
be
determined
by
sending
back
to
the
court,
that's
the
question
i
asked
to
one
of
the
counsels
some
time
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
because
you
think
the
attorney
general
has
done
it
and
that's
all
that
it
understood.
suppose
that
one
didn't
have
that
belief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
not
any
settlement,
this
is
this
settlement
that
we've
ordered
the
divestiture
and
it
seems
to
me
a
genuine
bona
fide
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
agreed
to
something
less
than
the
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
rather
go
back,
contention
was
that
the
court
rather
than
the
attorney
general
should
have
the
final
say
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
complete
divestiture.
i
thought
that
was
what
they
were
raising.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
has
no
authority.
it
might
mean
that
he
has
no
authority
to
frustrate
the
order
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
he
settle
without
the
consent
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
be
finding
to
let
the
objective
say
anything
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
claim
that
you
have
the
right
to
litigate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
claim
that
you
have
the
right
to
litigate
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
the
right
to
litigate
to
decide
whether
the
decree
would
be
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
they
just
inform
the
mandate
of
the
court
with
no
right
to
litigate
at
all,
(inaudible)
position
to
stay
in,
a
reason
of
the
government
to
stand
its
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
(inaudible)
would
then
indicate
to
the
government's
position
to
litigate
the
(inaudible).
what
--
what
do
you
have
to
litigate
then
if
you
were
allowed
to
litigate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
this
decree
has
to
be
followed
by
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
chance
to
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
divestiture
must
be
out
at
all
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
if
they
had
not
make
the
case
also
if
the
case
is
here
but
assume
that
the
court's
decision
is
suppose
to
be
obeyed
and
it
is
also
limited.
but
prove
inadequate
representation
at
that
time,
why
could
this
court
not
consider
that
is
not
necessary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
to
--
you
wanted
to
dispose
of
before
you
have
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
were
not
to
be
obtained
until
--
for
someone
else?
this
court
is
also
concerned
with
dispositions
they
made.
there
are
other
people
interested
in
sub,
however
ordinarily
they
would
not
care
of
that.
but
the
person
who
was
on
the
record
did
not
adequately
represent
the
problem
and
that
came
before
this
court
and
assumed
the
proper
mandates.
why
should
the
court
not
have
a
right
to
enforce
to
take
such
steps
that
were
necessary
to
see
that
its
procedures
carried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
goes
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
without
power
even
when
it's
brought
(inaudible)
because
without
the
power
they
let
it
on

of
the

justice

so
i
would
--
and
i
think
the
controversies
he
knows
what
it
is
but
call
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.

i
find
it
investigated

justice

black
where
does
the
question
finally
comes
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
will
this
question
finally
end?
the
charge
here,
by

bought

claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
issue
of
fact.
that
they
have
sought
the
right
to
have
to
determine
why
should
they
have
the
right
to
have
it
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
not
just
settle
a
case,
there's
a
big
broad
term.
what
the
settlement
they
claim
you
have
made
herein
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
they
claim
wrongly
is
that
you
have
settled
in
a
way
that
defeats
the
object
of
this
court
to
bring
about
a
complete
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that's
not
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
divestiture
except
divestiture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
issue
of
fact
and
they
say
that
hasn't
been
--
that's
not
true
and
you
say,
well,
whether
it's
true
or
not
makes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
settle
the
case?
i
attempted
to
suggest
mr.
justice
that
the
reason
i
gave
the
description
of
what
the
settlement
negotiations
involved,
and
the
basis
on
which
we
settled
i
attempted
to
do
that
to
show
the
factors
which
led
the
attorney
general
into
settling
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
the
right
way.
it's
not
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
complete
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
like
this,
would
it?
in
here,
divestiture
has
been
ordered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
any
question
in
event
would
indicate
in
such
position
as
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
think
about
of
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
probably
be
so
frivolous
that
the
court
has
not
passed
any
attention
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
is
so
far
from
frivolous
that
the
government
found
in
keeping
having
the
facts
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
malfeasance
is
an
absolute
before
anything
can
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
right
and
you
have
settled
on
the
basis
which
does
not
bring
about
complete
divestiture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
shouldn't
the
court
have
some
way
to
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
if
they
give
the
case
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
the
best
way
to
do
that
would
be
to
try
it
out,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
serious
enough
to
justify
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
bring
about
a
complete
divestiture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
courts
in
two
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
an
independent
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
would
not
be
a
complete
divestiture,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
be
enough
evidence
in
the
record
for
us
to
determine
that
one
way
or
the
other
or
would
that
have
to
be
determined
by
sending
back
to
the
court,
that's
the
question
i
asked
to
one
of
the
counsels
some
time
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
because
you
think
the
attorney
general
has
done
it
and
that's
all
that
it
understood.
suppose
that
one
didn't
have
that
belief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
not
any
settlement,
this
is
this
settlement
that
we've
ordered
the
divestiture
and
it
seems
to
me
a
genuine
bona
fide
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
agreed
to
something
less
than
the
divestiture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
rather
go
back,
contention
was
that
the
court
rather
than
the
attorney
general
should
have
the
final
say
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
complete
divestiture.
i
thought
that
was
what
they
were
raising.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
has
no
authority.
it
might
mean
that
he
has
no
authority
to
frustrate
the
order
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
he
settle
without
the
consent
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
be
finding
to
let
the
objective
say
anything
about
it.
