mr.
robert
c.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
we
have
overstayed
the
time.
i
was
--
i
would
develop
what
argument
i
could
make
it
within
an
abbreviated
period
of
time
that
it
will
be
brief
and
somewhat
abortive.
the
second
one
of
the
petitioner
relates
to
the
maryland's
former
practice
where
all
the
--
which
limits
the
trial
motion
for
three
days
including
on
any
go
round,
including
newly
discovered
evidence.
my
brother
challenges
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
says
and
that
seems
that
the
state
has
required
to
provide
to
condemn
persons
a
reasonable
opportunity
presumably
through
a
due
trial
mechanism
demonstrate
their
innocence
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence
that
the
maryland
rule
of
three
days
simply
was
not
reasonable,
was
lacking
in
fundamental
fairness
and
a
classic
due
process
terms
that
is
shocking
to
the
universal
sense
of
justice.
we
say
in
response
to
that
your
honor
is
that
due
process
does
not
require
a
new
trial
and
that
where
a
state
grants
a
new
trial,
it
may
impose
such
time
limitations
on
the
availability
as
it
sees
fit.
we
don't
here
maintain
the
three
days
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
and
i
might
add,
that's
no
longer
the
maryland
rule,
we
now
have
the
90-day
new
trial
motion
for
newly
discovered
evidence
but
this
court
has
enunciated
the
principal
proposition
many
years
ago.
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
case
of
james
versus
appellant,
192
u.s.
in
1904
decision
he
said
subsequently
and
very
briefly
in
three
sentences
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
simply
quote
that
on
this
particular
point,
“we
no
more
can
doubt
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
enact
that
statutes
of
limitation
or
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
we
can
doubt
its
power
to
an
access
of
statute
for
the
bringing
of
action.
it
may
be
a
questioned
whether
there
would
be
any
constitutional
objection
to
a
law
making
the
original
judgment
final
and
doing
a
way
with
new
trial
altogether.”
re-hearings,
new
trials
are
not
essential
to
due
process
of
law
either
in
judicial
or
administrative
proceedings
cited
in
earlier
case
of
this
court,
railroad
company
versus
bach
as
in
154
u.s.
that
proposition
remains
the
law
of
the
land
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
of
course
the
new
rules
of
the
court
both
state
and
federal
and
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
setting
forth
time
limitations
on
new
trials
that
are
now
with
us.
we
--
the
former
rule
of
the
expiration
of
the
term
of
court
has
a
cut
off
period
for
new
trials
is
no
longer
the
law
but
there
have
been
cases
of
this
court
where
individuals
sought
to
avail
themselves
of
new
trials
after
the
5-day
period.
this
court
has
said,
this
is
a
matter
of
power
of
jurisdiction.
you
must
do
it
within
the
period
specified
or
not
at
all.
again,
i
say
the
question
of
the
power
of
jurisdiction
there
is
not
due
process
requirement
involved.
my
brothers
seem
to
suggest
that
--
apparently
seek
to
utilize
a
due
process
clause
here
as
a
vehicle
to
create
power
or
to
enlarge
power
as
we
say
of
course
they
are
being
held
constitutional
predicate
for
a
new
trial
here.
the
state
of
maryland's
limitation
of
three
days
although
it
may
appear
unreasonable
is
not
unconstitutional.
there
is
a
second
point
perhaps
more
difficult,
the
equal
protection
argument
of
my
brother,
basically
amounts
to
this.
as
your
honors
know
in
maryland
the
jury
is
the
judge
of
the
law
and
the
fact
in
the
criminal
case.
from
that
predicate,
the
intention
is
made
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
denied
the
petitioners
in
this
case
equal
protection
of
the
law
when
they
substituted
their
judgment
for
the
exculpatory
value
of
the
alleged
rape
claim,
the
alleged
suicide
evidence
for
the
determination
that
may
have
been
made
for
a
jury.
they
say
in
essence
that
we
have
picked
out
a
specie
of
case
and
have
applied
a
different
standard
to
this
type
of
case
and
we
would
do
any
other
case
we
violated
around
the
principle
and
the
principles
of
due
process
and
equal
protection.
we
say
to
that
of
course
that
the
predicate
to
make
that
argument
a
rational
one
is
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
had
indicated
that
the
evidence
of
question
was
admissible.
it
did
not.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
evidence
of
the
false
rape
claim
and
of
the
suicide
attempt
was
not
admissible
so
that
the
equal
protection
argument
falls
right
there.
it
requires
a
bottom
of
admissibility
of
the
evidence
before
it
can
be
utilized.
i
think
what
my
brothers
had
in
mind
was
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals,
fortuitously
perhaps
stated
that
even
if
this
evidence
were
admissible
and
nevertheless
it
wasn't
of
sufficient
exculpatory
value
to
be
--
to
give
rise
of
the
application
of
the
suppression
doctrine
for
that
we
say
it
is.
this
was
a
post-conviction
procedure
act
proceeding
with
which
i
am
sure
your
honors
are
familiar.
we
have
that
act
in
maryland.
that
is
a
civil
case.
this
was
not
a
trial
of
criminal
case
but
many
of
that
in
maryland
and
all
our
post-conviction
procedure
act
case
there
is
no
jury.
the
judge
determines
all
relevant
matters
of
fact
and
law.
suppression
cases
are
treated
like
any
other
case.
the
voluntariness
case
for
example
of
a
confession,
the
trial
judge
makes
all
relevant
determinations.
we
haven't
treated
suppression
cases
any
different
than
we
treat
any
other
case.
it's
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
if
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
in
this
brief
time
i'm
talking
rather
fast
but
we
would
say
this
as
your
honors
recall
in
thomson
versus
(inaudible),
you
said
in
essence
that
substantial
allegation
of
newly
discovered
evidence
where
all
of
these
available
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
setting
that
if
such
allegations
are
made
and
incumbent
upon
a
trial
judge
to
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
newly
discovered
evidence
would
furnish
a
predicate
for
a
constitutional
claim.
you
also
said
that
the
newly
discovered
evidence
which
merely
goes
to
the
question
of
innocence
or
guilt
is
not
grounds
for
such
a
hearing
and
in
other
words
i
think
the
essence
of
what
you've
done
was
to
reaffirm
the
proposition
that
a
new
trial
was
not
an
essential
reading
of
due
process.
but
you
haven't
slammed
the
door
and
said
that
you
can't
do
anything
with
this
newly
discovered
evidence
or
whatsoever.
again,
i
apologize
for
this
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
basically
your
honor
the
newly
discovered
evidence
is
that
what
she
says
is
suppressed.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yeah,
she
is
doing
it
right
now.
he
--
the
newly
discovered
evidence
is
that
what
she
said
is
suppressed
and
upon
which
he's
taking
a
two-pronged
attack.
one
on
suppression
to
get
a
new
trial
and
if
that
fails
then
they
simply
want
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
innocence
or
guilt
which
we
say
is
not
proper.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
not.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
we
have
overstayed
the
time.
i
was
--
i
would
develop
what
