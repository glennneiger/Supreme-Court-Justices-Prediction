justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
only
due
process
argument
you're
making
here
that
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
for
the
state
authority
is
not
to
inform
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
have
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
as
far
as
you
go
from
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
forer,
i
beg
your
pardon,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
anybody
engaged
in
the
trial
that
actual
knowledge
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before,
i
would
just
like
to
be
sure
mr.
forer
you're
not
arguing
here
constitutionally
there
was
a
broad
discovery
obligation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
a
private
party.
i
gather
your
argument
is
on
the
basis
of
the
four
elements.
the
real
problem
here
was
(inaudible)
raped
her.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
point
is
that
at
least
when
they,
there
is
in
their
possession
knowledge
which
may
not
be
in
the
possession
of
the
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
wasn't
which
bears
upon
the
credibility
of
her
story
that
what?
they
should
have
notified
the
defense
that
they
have
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
due
process
required
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
he
know
if
anything
of
the
conversation
between
joyce
and
sergeant
wheeler?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
the
pendency
of
that
frugal
purpose
was
not
known
by
the
defense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
state's
attorney
know
that
fact
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
prosecution
knows
at
the
time
of
trial
when
it's
presenting
its
case
and
anticipate
the
defense
of
the
defense
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
talking
about
the
time
of
the
trial
rather
than
the
time
of
the
actual
alleged
rape.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
basis
of
our
commitment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
our
commitment
by
montgomery
county.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
apparently
is
september
5,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
september.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
defense
counsel
was
an
assigned
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
include
assignment
as
an
investigator
to
help
her?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
there
have
been
assigned
if
he
did
the
test
under
maryland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
assigned
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
there
any
record
in
montgomery
county?
if
he
got
the
judge's
permission
with
nothing
to
see
about
this
dealing
with
montgomery.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
at
that
time
new?
i
thought
this
proceeding
was
pending
in
prince
george?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
montgomery
county.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
he
testified
the
post-conviction
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
trial
was
december
1961.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
the
post-conviction
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
then
that
the
attorney
testified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
212,
doesn't
it?
“no,
we
attempted
to
obtain
the
record
from
the
juvenile
court
here
in
montgomery
county
and
prince
george
county
but
they
were
not
released
for
us.
we
were
not
able
to
see
those.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
getting
back
if
you
will
of
these
juvenile
court
records.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
that
mr.
prescott
was
asked
the
question
by
mr.
kardy
in
the
cross-examination.
at
the
top
of
page
215,
mr.
prescott
said
he
made
efforts
in
montgomery
county
and
prince
george's
county
in
regard
of
the
juvenile
court,
so
on
that
basis
you
knew
there
was
some
action
of
proceeding
in
both
jurisdiction.
and
to
know
they
didn't
even
go
so
far
as
to
tell
me
that.
they
just
told
me
that
i
could
not
have
the
records
that
they
have
there.
the
information
i
got
from
sending
that
came
from
giles
(inaudible).
it
was
not
suggested
that
he
knew
something
and
he
asked
for
them
but
they
wouldn't
let
them
have
them.
i
don't
know
who
they
would
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
says
here
that
both
as
to
montgomery
and
prince
george's
as
i
understand
that
answer
they
didn't
admit
that
there
had
a
proceeding
in
montgomery
county
whoever
they
may
be.
i
suppose
that
you
can
put
authority.
they
wouldn't
let
him
see
any
record
about
her.
is
that
what
he
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
that's
the
only
evidence
here
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that
on?
the
one
mr.
forer
referred
to
us
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
270
to
275
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
say
that
right
in
the
middle
of
it?
this
is
september
5,
the
court
advised
that
this
came
to
this
court
from
the
state's
attorney's
office
because
the
difficulties
at
home
and
also
she
was
a
state
witness
in
a
case
with
two
adults
at
charge.
and
it
seems
her
situation
was
one
where
she
has
been
on
the
hospital
for
taking
pills
and
that's
concerned
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
that
charge
involving
those
two
of
those
that
the
one
in
august
which
involves
the
second
alleged
rape?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
stipulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thanks.
now,
did
that
follow
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
allow
evidence,
the
exhibit
three
for
identification
with
the
275?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought,
mr.
forer
told
us
that
the
exhibit
3
for
identification
of
275
which
is
the
formal
court
record
of
the
juvenile
court
of
the
hearing
on
september
5,
three
months
before
the
trial
that
that
was
offered
in
evidence
and
the
court
refused
receive
it
an
evidence,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is
what
you
referred
as
to
174
is
the
stipulation
is
it
not
regarding
the
prince
george's
county
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
one
of
the
proceedings
which
interest
me
even
more.
in
montgomery
county
on
september
5,
1961
which
is
at
page
275
petition
is
exhibit
three
for
identification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
transferred
to
montgomery
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
what's
the
significance
of
that
paragraph
summary
of
hearing
which
i
referred
to
before
particularly
and
also
she
was
the
state
witness
in
the
case
where
two
adults
are
charged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
the
giles
case.
it
referred
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait
a
minute
apparently
here
occasion
for
hearing
and
also
that
said
child
is
a
necessary
witness
on
behalf
of
the
state
regarding
a
criminal
case
pending
in
the
circuit
court
for
montgomery
county.
and
the
summary
of
the
hearing
that
she
was
a
state
witness
in
the
case
where
two
adults
are
charged
in
this
august
incident,
i
understand
were
two
men
involved
at
the
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
there
were
three
involved
in
the
giles
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
there
was
a
hearing
mr.
needle
on
september
the
5th,
three
months
before
the
trial.
now,
i
take
that
maryland
has
some
kind
of
pre-sentence
investigation
proceeding
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
involves
probation
officers
and
the
like.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
such
a
report
from
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
ordinarily
would
we
expect
the
course?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
maryland
have
a
practice
that
in
the
defense
counsel
before
a
sentence
see
the
investigation
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
mr.
needle,
ms.
lynn
adams
who
apparently
did
make
according
to
her
testimony
an
investigation
before
that
hearing
of
september
5,
she
may
have
filed
some
kind
of
a
report
sort
of
thing.
and
that
certainly
is
not
here
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
forer,
before
you
begin,
may
i
ask
i
gather
if
you
prevail,
there
will
have
to
be
a
new
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
i
think
presently
stand
a
new
trial
but
again
was
all
on
the
death
penalty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
giles
brothers
familiar
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
are
willing
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
discussion
of
one
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
only
due
process
argument
you're
making
here
that
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
for
the
state
authority
is
not
to
inform
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
have
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
as
far
as
you
go
from
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
forer,
i
beg
your
pardon,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
anybody
engaged
in
the
trial
that
actual
knowledge
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before,
i
would
just
like
to
be
sure
mr.
forer
you're
not
arguing
here
constitutionally
there
was
a
broad
discovery
obligation.

william
j.
brennan,

on
a
private

i
gather

is

wasn't

that

you're
talking

trial
rather
than
the
time
of
the
actual
alleged
rape.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
basis
of
our
commitment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
our
commitment
by
montgomery
county.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

this
apparently
is
september

is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

september.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the

counsel
was
an

did
that
include

would
there
have
been
assigned

justice
william

he
was
assigned
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
was
there
any

in

if
he
got

permission
with
nothing
to
see
about
this
dealing
with
montgomery.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

was
there
at

i
thought
this

pending
in
prince
george?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
montgomery

justice
william

then
he
testified
the

william

not
at
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
trial
was
december
1961.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

when
was
the
post-conviction

and
it's

that
the

testified.

doesn't
it?
“no,
we
attempted
to
obtain
the

from

court
here
in
montgomery

and
prince
george

but
they
were

we
were

justice
william

excuse
me,
getting
back
if
you
will
of
these
juvenile
court
records.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
noticed
that
mr.
prescott
was
asked
the
question
by
mr.
kardy
in
the
cross-examination.
at
the

of

mr.
prescott
said
he
made
efforts
in
montgomery

in

of
the
juvenile
court,
so
on
that
basis
you
knew
there
was
some
action
of
proceeding
in
both
jurisdiction.
and
to
know
they
didn't
even
go
so
far
as
to
tell
me
that.
they
just
told
me
that
i
could
not
have
the
records
that
they
have
there.
the

i

i
don't
know
who
they
would
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
says
here
that
both
as
to
montgomery
and
prince
george's
as
i
understand
that
answer
they
didn't
admit
that
there
had
a
proceeding
in
montgomery
county
whoever
they
may
be.
i
suppose
that
you
can
put
authority.
they
wouldn't
let
him
see
any
record
about
her.
is
that
what
he
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
that's
the
only
evidence
here
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that
on?
the
one
mr.

referred
to
us
earlier.

(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
can
you
say
that
right
in
the
middle
of
it?
this
is
september
5,
the
court
advised
that
this
came
to
this
court
from
the
state's
attorney's
office
because
the
difficulties
at
home
and
also
she
was
a
state
witness
in
a
case
with
two
adults
at
charge.
and
it
seems
her
situation
was
one
where
she
has
been
on
the
hospital
for
taking
pills
and
that's
concerned
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
what's
that
charge
involving
those
two
of
those
that
the
one
in
august
which
involves
the
second
alleged
rape?
justice
william

where
is
that
stipulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

thanks.
now,
did
that
follow
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
allow
evidence,
the
exhibit
three
for
identification
with
the
275?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought,
mr.
forer
told
us
that
the
exhibit
3
for
identification
of
275
which
is
the
formal
court
record
of
the
juvenile
court
of
the
hearing
on
september
5,
three
months
before
the
trial
that
that
was
offered
in
evidence
and
the
court
refused
receive
it
an
evidence,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is
what
you
referred
as
to
174
is
the
stipulation
is
it
not
regarding
the
prince
george's
county
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
one
of
the
proceedings
which
interest
me
even
more.
in
montgomery
county
on
september
5,
1961
which
is
at
page
275
petition
is
exhibit
three
for
identification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
transferred
to
montgomery
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
what's
the
significance
of
that
paragraph
summary
of
hearing
which
i
referred
to
before
particularly
and
also
she
was
the
state
witness
in
the
case
where
two
adults
are
charged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
the
giles
case.
it
referred
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait
a
minute
apparently
here
occasion
for
hearing
and
also
that
said
child
is
a
necessary
witness
on
behalf
of
the
state
regarding
a
criminal
case
pending
in
the
circuit
court
for
montgomery
county.
and
the
summary
of
the
hearing
that
she
was
a
state
witness
in
the
case
where
two
adults
are
charged
in
this
august
incident,
i
understand
were
two
men
involved
at
the
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
there
were
three
involved
in
the
giles
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
there
was
a
hearing
mr.
needle
on
september
the
5th,
three
months
before
the
trial.
now,
i
take
that
maryland
has
some
kind
of
pre-sentence
investigation
proceeding
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
involves
probation
officers
and
the
like.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
such
a
report
from
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
ordinarily
would
we
expect
the
course?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
maryland
have
a
practice
that
in
the
defense
counsel
before
a
sentence
see
the
investigation
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
mr.
needle,
ms.
lynn
adams
who
apparently
did
make
according
to
her
testimony
an
investigation
before
that
hearing
of
september
5,
she
may
have
filed
some
kind
of
a
report
sort
of
thing.
and
that
certainly
is
not
here
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
forer,
before
you
begin,
may
i
ask
i
gather
if
you
prevail,
there
will
have
to
be
a
new
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
i
think
presently
stand
a
new
trial
but
again
was
all
on
the
death
penalty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
giles
brothers
familiar
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
are
willing
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
