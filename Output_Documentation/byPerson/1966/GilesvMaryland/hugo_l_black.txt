they
should
the

is
it
your

--
it
would
be
a
violation
of

for
maryland
to
define
and

should
made
evidence
to

time
they
admitted
the

yes,
but
if

what
the
due

law
is?
justice

black
to
go
further.
you
have
to
go
further,
do
you
not?
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of

but
it's
also
is
not
to
give
them
information
would
it
of
that
evidence
which
would
not
be
admissible
in
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
got
to
give
all
--
got
to
cite
all
of
the

he
thinks
might
lead
them
--
let
them
be
lead
to
obtain
some
other
evidence
to
be
admissible.
justice
