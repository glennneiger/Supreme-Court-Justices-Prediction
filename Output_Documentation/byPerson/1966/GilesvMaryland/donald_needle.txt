mr.
donald
needle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
all
of
the
importance
really
of
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
because
of
the
gloss
which
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
perhaps
put
on
those
facts
that
should
be
reviewed.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
what
we're
talking
about
number
one
is
information
known
to
persons
in
two
counties
of
the
state
of
maryland
we're
talking
about
information
number
one
known
by
the
state's
attorney
leonard
kardy
of
montgomery
county.
we're
talking
about
information
known
by
lieutenant
whalen
the
chief
investigator
of
this
case
who
was
also
in
montgomery
county.
but
the
most
important
information
known
is
the
information
known
in
this
case
by
sergeant
wheeler
of
the
prince
george's
county
police.
the
other
most
important
information
in
this
case
also
prince
george's
county
information
is
located
number
one,
in
the
prince
george's
county
hospital
record;
and
number
two
in
a
juvenile
court
record
of
prince
george's
county.
now,
the
basis
of
our
brief
really
is
that
this
case
has
got
to
analyzed
in
proper
perspective.
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
ascertained
is
what
did
the
prosecution
includes
know,
or
what
is
the
prosecution
charge
for
it.
who
is
the
prosecution?
now
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
found
even
a
more
broad
rule
that
has
been
announced
in
the
past,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
prosecution
would
consist
in
this
case
of
kardy
the
state's
attorney
and
his
assistance
and
the
police
of
montgomery
county.
now,
notice
that
is
the
police
of
montgomery
county.
we
argue
that
information
known
not
only
by
kardy
in
this
case
by
perhaps
known
by
some
other
officer
in
montgomery
county
even
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
could
be
said
by
the
defense
analogy
in
this
case
to
be
imputable
to
the
prosecution.
now,
we
maintain
that
our
own
court
of
appeals
was
even
too
broad
that
what
should
be
known
by
the
prosecution
should
be
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
and
additionally
the
knowledge
of
the
investigating
officers.
now,
we
maintain
that
if
the
rule
is
any
different,
what
--
where
are
we
going
and
what
does
it
mean?
now,
montgomery
county
has
a
population
of
approximately
500,000
people
the
same
with
the
other
adjourning
county.
or
let's
look
at
jersey
city,
new
jersey,
and
let's
look
at
new
york
city.
is
every
police
officer
of
either
of
these
adjourning
municipalities
jurisdiction
to
know
number
one,
who
are
to
be
the
state
witnesses?
who
has
made
a
complaint
of
crime
and
is
to
testify
in
the
case?
are
all
state
or
municipal
police
officers
to
know
that
fact
much
less
whether
or
not
any
particular
piece
of
information
that
they
might
have
would
be
useful
if
they
don't
know
the
facts
of
the
case?
much
less,
what,
excuse
me
--
much
less
whether
a
particular
piece
of
information
that
they
might
have
about
a
witness
what
if
you
tell
what
it
would
be.
so
therefore,
we
claim
that
the
only
legitimate
rule
which
can
be
passed,
the
only
practical
test
of
prosecution
knowledge
can
be
that
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
prosecutor
and
his
assistants
and
his
agents.
and
secondly,
of
those
officers
that
investigated
the
case.
now
--
mr.
donald
needle
by
the
prosecutor
sir
i
mean
in
this
instance,
the
prosecutor
of
montgomery
county,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
donald
needle
he
and
his
agents
or
assistants
plus
montgomery
county
police
report.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
yes
sir.
of
course
the
question
is
moot
because
his
assistant
is
the
prosecutor
of
a
given
case.
so
the
question
of
who
is
in
compass
within
the
term
the
prosecution
i
say
would
be
the
state's
attorney
and
all
of
his
assistants.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir
i
would
say
too.
mr.
donald
needle
well
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
think
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
we're
splitting
here
really
talking
about
--
mr.
donald
needle
if
the
state's
attorney
has
not
in
fact
prosecuted
the
case
at
trial,
then
he
of
course
would
never
be
charged
with
suppressing
evidence.
it
would
be
the
person
that
prosecuted
the
case
that
would
be
charge
would
suppress
it.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
say
no
sir,
would
that
interest
in
the
case
is
of
the
prosecutor
and
any
information
that
his
subagents
might
have
given
him
and
would
have
aide
him
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
it
is.
mr.
donald
needle
no
--
mr.
donald
needle
we
don't
ask
you
to
narrow
it
sir
but
we
point
out
in
our
position
to
the
defense
claim
that
our
court
of
appeals
was
in
error.
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
needle
well,
we're
not
saying
it
was.
we're
pointing
out
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
case
was
that
we
can
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
harder
on
the
prosecution
than
it
had
to
be
and
it
gives
us
perhaps
a
greater
course
to
complain
that
it
would
give
the
defense
to
complain
because
of
the
future
possible
implication.
mr.
donald
needle
i
think
that
implication
can
be
read
into
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
of
course
--
mr.
donald
needle
the
course
came
out
with
an
odd
statement
that
the
prosecution
should
be
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
and
his
assistants
and
of
the
police
department
of
that
jurisdiction
which
has
the
control
or
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
and
that
in
the
next
sentence,
they
said,
this
would
mean
applying
to
this
case
that
our
interest
is
in
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
kardy
and
of
lieutenant
whalen
who
were
the
only
or
whalen
was
the
only
montgomery
county
officer
actually
involved.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
before
getting
further
into
the
legal
argument
of
this
case
that
the
state's
evidence
was
not
solely
the
evidence
of
joyce
roberts
against
the
evidence
of
petition.
and
our
case
was
not
an
uncorroborated
case.
the
evidence
was
clear.
this
joyce
roberts
only
16
years
old
did
go
out
to
patuxent
river
area
at
midnight.
and
she
went
out
there
with
three
boys.
but
the
evidence
is
clear
that
she
went
there
to
go
swimming
and
others
were
to
meet
them
there.
that
when
the
others
didn't
come
within
minutes,
they
left.
joyce
roberts
and
the
three
boys
started
to
go.
their
car
then
ran
out
of
gas.
two
of
the
three
boys
out
with
joyce
roberts
in
that
car
left
to
get
gas,
leaving
joyce
roberts
and
stewart
foster
in
that
car.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
giles
boys
who
had
been
swimming
and
fishing
came
upon
the
scene
and
they
saw
the
car.
and
of
course
this
is
where
the
evidence
becomes
conflicted.
the
giles
boys
testified
in
the
trial
that
the
reason
that
they
broke
into
that
car,
the
windows
were
locked
--
the
windows
were
closed,
the
doors
were
locked.
but
the
reason
why
they
shattered
those
windows
of
that
car
and
drags
foster
out
of
that
car
and
not
being
conscious
was
because
they
claim
that
stewart
foster
had
a
gun
in
that
car.
now
here
is
stewart
foster
in
that
car,
joyce
roberts
in
that
car
and
here
are
three
persons
that
are
opposed
to
this
one
other
man.
now,
the
complete
and
credulous
proposition
that
was
forwarded
by
the
defense
just
didn't
support
the
proposition.
so
you
have
a
demolished
car
to
corroborate
the
state's
case.
you
have
stewart
foster
found
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
the
first
police
officer
who
arrived
on
the
scene,
you
find
him
bloody,
you
find
him
hysteric,
you
find
that
he's
taken
and
rushed
to
the
hospital
and
given
eight
stitches.
you
find
joyce
roberts
lying
on
the
ground,
well
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
first
police
officer
on
the
scene.
mr.
donald
needle
joyce
roberts
sir,
the
prosecuting
witness.
the
first
police
officer
that
arrived
on
the
scene
testified
of
what
he
found
and
described
foster's
condition
which
i
have
just
related
and
then
described
what
he
found
as
far
as
joyce
roberts'
condition.
she
was
found
lying
on
the
ground
with
her
blouse
on
open
in
a
semiconscious
condition.
the
police
officer
and
stewart
foster
had
to
pick
joyce
vilely
up
off
of
the
ground
and
help
her
get
dressed.
she
was
taken
to
the
hospital.
now,
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
hospital
record,
of
any
force?
well,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
doctor
testified
for
the
state
at
the
trial
that
there
were
operations
of
the
shoulders,
of
the
legs,
and
of
the
neck
of
the
prosecuting
witness.
they
further
testified
that
there
were
leaves,
there
were
dirt
and
grass
adherent
to
the
back
of
her
body.
there
were
numerous
spermatozoa
cells
found
in
the
vagina.
now,
we
maintain
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
uncorroborated
testimony
of
a
prosecuting
witness
which
has
served
now
to
place
three
persons
in
jail
that
the
state's
case
was
fully
corroborated.
now,
the
prosecutor
knew
this
evidence
ahead
of
time.
in
addition
to
that,
the
prosecutor
spoke
to
and
interviewed
joyce
roberts.
he
spoke
to
her
before
the
giles
case.
he
spoke
to
her
before
the
johnson
case
which
was
held
there.
he
had
an
interview
with
the
defense
counsel,
mr.
steven
prescott.
he
told
the
defense
counsel
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
this
girl
was
100%
that
there
was
nothing
as
far
as
he
knew
that
would
cast
any
aspersions
whatsoever
on
her
credibility.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
found
that
by
the
giles
version
of
this
incident
to
their
own
counsel.
their
own
counsel
must
have
known,
number
one,
that
this
girl
was
a
sexually
promiscuous
girl
and
that
her
background
was
not
of
the
finest.
there
was
evidence
in
other
words
which
the
defense
counsel
knew
wherein
the
court
of
appeals
said
which
should
have
been
investigated.
mr.
forer
has
named
certain
things
the
defense
of
the
case
was
that
joyce
roberts
had
told
these
defendants
that
she
had
that
same
week
engaged
in
intercourse
with
16
other
persons.
now,
if
that
was
true,
and
if
the
defense
counsel
knew
that,
was
there
any
obligation
on
the
defense
counsel
to
go
and
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
was
any
truth
in
this
assertion.
now,
what
did
the
defense
counsel
do?
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
there
was
no
request
for
investigators.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
know
your
honor
of
any
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
and
he
was
assigned
in
september
and
had
approximately
three
months
to
prepare
for
this
case.
now,
what
was
the
preparation?
number
one,
he
claims
that
he
went
to
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
because
the
petitioners
had
allegedly
been
told
by
joyce
roberts
that
she
was
on
probation
and
that
if
she
was
caught
she
would
have
to
claim
rape.
they
went
to
the
juvenile
court
because
they
had
an
indication
that
the
juvenile
court
might
have
something.
but
they
weren't
allowed
to
see
the
juvenile
court
records.
why?
because
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
our
appendix,
maryland
rule
922
said
that
in
order
to
see
a
record
of
the
juvenile
case,
you
must
seek
and
obtain
the
permission
of
the
judge.
now,
it
is
admitted
that
this
was
not
sought.
now,
wouldn't
that
in
and
of
itself
the
simple
matter
of
getting
a
judge's
signature
permission
to
see
a
record,
does
this
in
itself
show
a
lack
of
diligence?
mr.
donald
needle
if
you
will
look
at
--
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
the
record
which
is
the
petitioner's
exhibit
number
three
in
which
i
had
pointed
out
as
for
verification
which
mr.
forer
pointed
related
to
a
hearing
on
september
the
5th
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
now,
this
record
would
have
been
available
had
the
proper
procedural
pattern
been
followed.
mr.
donald
needle
there
is
no
direct
testimony
in
the
record
sir,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
this
is
not
in
the
record.
as
i
said
the
record
is
not
clear.
the
only
testimony
we
have
on
this
point
is
that
of
mr.
prescott
himself.
now,
he
did
not
deny
that
there
was
a
record,
or
he
did
not
state
that
he
was
told
that
there
was
no
record
there.
mr.
donald
needle
he
stated
sir
that
he
attempted
to
see
the
record
but
could
not
and
that
was
--
that
is
the
only
thing
that
we
have
here
before
us
as
far
as
testimony
concerning
this
point.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
he
didn't
go
further.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
mr.
prescott
of
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
oh
no,
not
at
the
--
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
post
conviction
hearing
sir
was
in
july
of
1963.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
the
july
of
1964
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
he
was
put
on
the
stand
by
the
petitioner
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct
too.
mr.
prescott's
testimony
if
your
honor
please
appears
--
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
the
extent
testimony
with
that
particular
court.
now
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
say
that
sir,
but
i
would
say
that
you
could
also
infer
from
that
could
then
had
knowledge
that
there
were
in
fact
reference
concerning
this
girl.
now,
once
he
knew
that
did
he
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
talking
about
here.
he
--
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
does
he
did
not,
nor
he
did
ask
the
state's
attorney
for
assistance.
now,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
for
mr.
kardy's
testimony
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
had
a
request
been
made
of
him
for
assistance,
he
would
have
gotten
the
trial
judge's
permission
on
behalf
of
the
defense
counsel,
so
that
these
records
would
have
been
made
available.
now,
this
is
the
juvenile
court
record.
now,
prince
george's
county
hospital
record
would
show
that
joyce
roberts
had
attempted
suicide.
this
was
the
admitting
diagnosis
that
showed
also
that
this
episode
is
related
to
a
rape
several
weeks
ago.
now,
prince
george's
--
this
prince
george's
county
hospital
record
was
admittedly
unknown
to
anyone
who
may
be
considered
within
the
term
“the
prosecution.”
the
only
--
there
is
in
fact
no
evidence
that
anyone
even
including
the
prince
george's
county
sergeant
that
would
be
sergeant
wheeler
who
visited
joyce
in
the
hospital
never
saw
that
hospital
record.
so
that
hospital
record
is
of
prince
george's
county
hospital
which
was
discovered
three
years
after
this
trial
by
the
defense
counsel.
in
which
they're
claiming
now
that
the
prosecution
should
have
noted
that
and
should
have
discovered.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
the
they
in
there
sir
is
the
juvenile
court
authority
because
the
juvenile
or
the
clerk
of
the
juvenile
court
who
under
maryland
rule
922
which
i
set
out
in
our
appendix
was
not
authorized.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is,
yes
sir.
now,
the
second
matter
--
mr.
donald
needle
the
juvenile
court
proceedings?
mr.
donald
needle
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
exhibit
which
is
in
the
record
is
not
in
evidence.
now
this
is
petitioner's
exhibit
number
3
for
identification.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
now
you
notice
that
this
is
the
petitioner's
exhibit
three
for
identification.
now,
this
was
never
offered
into
evidence
--
mr.
donald
needle
this
as
far
as
my
--
mr.
donald
needle
--
refreshing
my
recollection
of
this
exhibit
--
mr.
donald
needle
well
this
is
correct
sir,
but
this
has
nothing
about
sexual
promiscuity
which
is
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
needle
the
point
is
as
far
as
prosecution
knowledge
of
this
report
there
was
none.
now,
lieutenant
whalen
testified
that
although
he
attended
this
particular
hearing
on
september
the
5th,
now
whalen
is
again
from
montgomery
county
and
in
charge
of
this
investigation.
although
he
attended
that
hearing
he
was
never
in
the
courtroom
except
when
he
testified
and
whalen
never
saw
this
report
and
it
is
admitted
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
no
one
or
the
prosecution
ever
saw
this
report.
so
in
direct
answer
to
your
question
sir
that
this
report
show
that
this
girl
was
sexually
promiscuous,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
if
your
honor
pleases
the
record
on
this
--
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
this
was
brought
by
mrs.
roberts,
the
mother
of
joyce
roberts.
mr.
donald
needle
who
had
visited
a
friend
mrs.
patterson,
a
probation
officer
in
the
prince
george's
county
juvenile
court
and
that
joyce
had
been
keeping
late
out
and
this
was
the
basis
of
the
mother's
petition
back
in
april
of
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
what
the
record
shows,
so
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
needle
no,
the
record
in
the
juvenile
court.
now
the
petition
had
been
filed
by
mrs.
roberts
back
in
april
of
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
now
the
hearing
--
mr.
donald
needle
it
showed
that
there
was
a
complaint
made
by
mrs.
roberts
that
her
daughter
was
out
of
parental
control.
now,
that
was
explained
by
mrs.
roberts
during
her
testimony
--
mr.
donald
needle
it
showed
that
joyce
roberts
was
out
of
parental
control.
mr.
donald
needle
the
petition
sir
was
never
offered
in
evidence
per
se.
we
don't
find
it
in
the
petition.
mr.
donald
needle
we
don't
know
sir.
we
know
what
was
in
this
--
what
is
in
this
record
and
what
was
introduced
in
the
lower
court.
now,
that
petition
has
never
been
introduced.
there
is
only
a
stipulation
in
this
record
stating
what
it
contained.
and
it
contained
a
statement
that
mrs.
roberts
had
filed
a
petition
stating
that
joyce
roberts
is
out
of
parental
control.
that
a
case
worker
investigated
this
complaint
and
suggested
that
joyce
roberts
be
placed
on
probation.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
this
was
an
oral
stipulation
between
the
state's
attorney
and
the
defense
counsel
at
the
post-conviction
hearing.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
it's
on
page
174
of
the
brief.
mr.
donald
needle
on
page
174
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
donald
needle
it
was
never
officially
offered
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
it
was
only
offered
for
identification,
there
was
no
motion
to
offer
it
into
evidence,
only
for
identification.
and
this
was
pointed
out
on
numerous
tons
by
mr.
kardy
whenever
the
counsel
made
reference
to
this
particular
record.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
your
honor
please,
the
initial
petition
in
this
case
concerning
joyce
roberts
which
ended
in
a
hearing
on
september
the
fifth
in
montgomery
county
had
been
filed
in
prince
george's
county.
and
that
is
the
same
hearing
that
we're
talking
about
on
the
stipulation.
mr.
donald
needle
yes.
now,
the
reason
that
that
was
transferred
to
montgomery
county
and
we
point
that
out
in
our
brief
is
that
subsequent
to
the
date
of
april
the
4th
when
this
initial
prince
george's
county
petition
was
sought,
joyce
roberts
and
her
family
had
been
subjected
to
gross
harassment.
the
mother
had
requested
lieutenant
whalen
to
have
her
placed
in
protective
custody.
and
lieutenant
whalen
called
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
of
montgomery
county
and
told
the
judge
of
that
court
that
this
girl
is
to
be
a
necessary
witness
in
the
state's
case.
a
hearing
therefore
was
held
in
montgomery
county
and
it
concerned
therefore
the
original
facts
contained
in
this
stipulation
plus
the
fact
that
the
state
wanted
her
held
for
her
own
protective
custody.
and
that's
why
the
hearing
was
held
in
montgomery.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
what
i
just
explained
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
yes.
it
wasn't
the
giles
case.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
but
no
charge
ever
made
this
report
refers
only
to
the
giles
case.
mr.
donald
needle
there
were
three
involved
sir.
but
they
were
treated
as
distinct
cases.
the
giles
brothers
is
one
case
because
a
severance
had
been
asked
as
far
as
the
third
party
was
concerned.
so,
if
i
might
continue
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
then
is
not
only
a
question
of
uncorroborated
testimony.
but
a
grossly
clear
picture
drawn
by
the
state
is
to
what
occurred
on
that
night.
now,
very
briefly,
we
maintain
that
other
than
the
question
of
the
utility
of
information
which
is
the
only
rule
which
mr.
forer
suggests
as
the
court
contests
that
there
are
many,
many
other
factors
in
this
case
to
be
given
very
serious
consideration
before
any
one
rule
can
be
made
to
be
imposed
upon
the
states
under
the
due
process
clause.
consideration
has
got
to
be
given
as
i
pointed
out
number
one,
what
did
the
state
know
or
what
was
the
state
chargeable
with
knowing?
consideration
has
got
to
be
given,
we
maintain,
to
what
did
the
defense
know
or
what
was
the
defense
chargeable
with
knowing.
now,
as
relates
to
the
evidence
itself,
consideration
must
be
given
not
only
to
usefulness
of
that
information.
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
admissibility
of
that
information.
again,
to
the
discoverability
of
that
information
under
existing
rules
of
discovery
and
inspection
available
in
the
states.
now,
maryland
rule
728
which
is
said
out
in
this
petition
is
broader
than
federal
rule
16.
under
neither
rule
would
any
of
these
evidence
have
been
discoverable
in
a
manner
of
pretrial
discovery
had
it
been
requested.
now,
we
state
that
this
is
a
very
important
factor
to
be
determined
along
with
the
mere
question
of
possible
usefulness
of
this
information.
it's
discoverability.
it's
availability.
now,
was
this
evidence
merely
cumulative
or
impeaching?
now,
if
it
was
so,
it
would
not
have
been
material
exculpatory
evidence.
and
finally,
was
the
evidence
contradictory
of
anything
that
happened
in
the
trial?
the
answer
is
no.
the
evidence
was
not
contradictory
of
anything
that
happened
in
the
trial.
now,
the
only
aspect
that
mr.
forer
can
point
to
trying
to
show
some
semblance
of
contradiction
would
be
the
fact
that
joyce
roberts
denied
that
she
was
on
probation.
however,
the
stipulation
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
prior
thereto
she
was
not
on
probation.
she
never
was
on
probation
and
still
--
and
is
not
now.
so
there
is
no
contradiction
of
any
trial
testimony.
so
we
maintain
that
before
a
rule
can
be
passed
in
this
case
that
the
state
must
disclose
not
only
what
it
knows
but
what
it
maybe
should
find
that
very
careful
consideration
has
got
to
be
given
to
these
other
factors,
to
what
the
state
really
knew
to
the
question
of
due
diligence
and
equal
availability
of
this
knowledge
to
the
defense
to
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
this
information
to
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
could
have
been
discovered
even
had
it
been
asked
and
note
finally
that
in
the
brady
case,
one
of
the
questions
or
one
of
the
prerequisites
to
relief
was
that
a
request
for
information
has
to
be
made.
now,
our
court
of
appeals
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
showed
that
these
defendants
must
have
known
--
must
have
known
of
the
character
and
reputation
of
this
girl
or
at
least
had
something
that
it
should
have
gone
and
investigate.
now,
we
maintain
sir
that
no
case
has
ever
held
so
far
as
we
now
that
unless
the
state
has
exclusive
knowledge
of
information
that
the
defense
knows
that
and
that
is
the
exclusive
knowledge
of
information
within
its
own
control
that
is
equally
available
to
the
defense
counsel
that
a
suppression
has
been
maintained
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
we
maintain
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
imposes
not
so
broad
an
obligation
as
that
which
is
sought
here.
we
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
say
that
a
prosecutor
is
to
prosecute
with
earnest
and
as
vigor.
you
have
said
that
in
the
burger
case
and
we
maintain
that
what
the
prosecution
is
precluded
from
doing
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
from
becoming
a
partisan
but
by
having
his
partisan
should
turn
into
impartiality
to
become
impartial
to
the
extent
of
being
disequal
of
to
the
extent
of
being
desized.
mr.
donald
needle
mr.
kardy
sir,
leonard
kardy.
mr.
donald
needle
if
you
honor
pleases,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
that
the
state's
attorney
could
give
you
a
quick
answer
on
that.
i
would
say
that
he
has
got
to
weigh
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
say
yes
sir
because
those
facts
are
then
completely
exculpatory
facts
these
are
facts
that
are
not
just
--
mr.
donald
needle
oh,
well
then
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
donald
needle
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
it
would
not
have
to
disclose
these
facts.
mr.
donald
needle
because
number
one
sir,
this
evidence
in
maryland
under
maryland
law
of
prior
false
rate
claim
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
maryland
law.
yes
sir
and
i
have
pointed
out
the
cases
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
only
--
not
a
prior
false
rape
claim
sir
but
we
maintain
we
have
here
not
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
needle
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
specifically
held
sir
that
evidence
of
a
prior
false
rape
claim
is
not
admissible
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
a
witness.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
if
your
honor
pleases,
this
evidence
as
long
as
it
does
not
relate
to
specific
acts
would
be
admissible.
specific
acts
of
misconduct
--
mr.
donald
needle
--
are
not
admissible
but
general
reputation
would
be
admissible.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
know
whether
he
has
the
fourteenth
amendment
duty
sir.
he
might
have
a
moral
obligation
to
it
because
this
would
be
admissible
evidence.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
i
don't
know
how
i
can
honestly
answer
you
sir.
i
say
that
as
far
as
the
constitutional
issue
is
concerned
that
there
should
be
no
positive
duty
on
them
to
do
so
because
the
question
is
not
merely
that
of
admissibility
and
the
question
is
not
merely
that
of
usefulness.
you
have
got
to
add
to
that
other
factors
and
other
factors
or
did
the
defendant
know
it?
what
was
the
real
extent
of
the
prosecution
knowledge?
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
agree
to
that
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
needle
they
threw,
your
honor
pleases,
large
rocks
and
boulders
into
that
car
and
shattered
all
the
windows
in
that
car.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
--
evidence
sir
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
donald
needle
the
excuse
that
they
gave
sir
was
that
stewart
foster
leaned
down
in
the
backseat
of
the
car
as
though
he
were
reaching
for
a
gun
and
in
order
to
prevent
foster
from
shooting
them,
they
broke
into
the
car.
mr.
donald
needle
they
claim
sir
that
they
wanted
to
prevent
foster
from
shooting
them.
that
was
the
extent
of
their
explanation.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
was
that
the
--
was
that
the
beginning
of
the
episode?
that
they
just
saw
him
reaching
down
to
the
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
donald
needle
well
no
sir.
prior
to
that
time
there
had
been
a
conversation.
mr.
donald
needle
in
which
the
--
mr.
donald
needle
well
they
claimed
--
the
defense
claimed
that
the
state
provoked
this
by
using
certain
racial
epithets.
mr.
donald
needle
by
using
certain
racial
epithets.
the
--
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
right,
that
is
the
answer
sir.
now,
the
chronology
of
the
events
were
that
one
of
the
boys
asked
stewart
foster
for
a
cigarette.
foster
said
he
had
no
cigarettes.
one
of
the
boys
then
asked
foster
for
money.
foster
said
he
had
no
money.
the
boys
then
went
behind
the
stalled
vehicle
in
which
joyce
and
foster
were
in.
it's
at
this
point
where
the
defendants
claim
they
saw
stewart
foster
bending
down
as
so
reaching
for
something.
they
also
claim
that
foster
had
called
them
certain
racial
names
that
there
had
been
an
argument.
and
because
of
these
names
and
because
foster
was
reaching
down
that
it
was
then
that
they
broke
the
windows.
so
there
had
been
a
conversation
of
course
prior
to
the
rocks
being
thrown.
now,
what
was
said
is
a
question
of
interpretation,
the
state's
interpretation
where
the
state's
evidence
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
provoke
this
attack.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
answer
your
honor
that
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
impose
that
obligation
in
this
case
because
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
are
now
all
cumulatively
known.
number
one
would
not
have
been
admissible
in
evidence.
they
--
we
admit
would
have
been
useful.
but
--
mr.
donald
needle
useful
sir.
but
we
maintain
sir
that
utility
of
information
is
not
to
be
considered
by
itself
that
there
are
even
with
all
of
these
cumulative
evidence
too
many
other
factors
involved
here.
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
the
fact
that
the
evidence
could
not
have
been
discovered
under
the
maryland
rules
and
the
implications
that
would
be
drawn
by
the
state
having
to
give
this
type
of
information.
we
maintain
sir
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
there
would
have
been
no
obligation
on
the
state's
attorney
had
he
known
all
of
these
evidence
cumulatively
even
as
opposed
to
what
he
in
fact
didn't
know.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
answer
no
sir
that
with
all
of
these
information
cumulatively
that
what
it
now
shows
would
not
have
precluded
or
did
not
prevent
the
petitioner
from
obtaining
a
fair
trial.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
i
think
in
that
regard
that
perhaps
this
evidence
might
under
a
moral
obligation
have
been
disclosed
as
regard
to
the
issue
of
sentence
but
i
point
out
also
in
answer
to
your
question
to
that
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
here
is
not
that
this
evidence
related
so
much
to
the
sentencing
because
that's
really
a
moot
question
at
this
point
since
the
sentence
has
been
commuted
by
the
governor.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
perhaps
it's
not
moot
sir
but
perhaps
i
(voice
overlap).
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that
perhaps
that
the
better
answer
is
that
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
goes
to
the
due
process
aspect
of
the
fairness
of
the
trial
as
regards
their
guilt
or
innocence
not
as
regards
the
punishment
to
be
imposed.
and
i
think
the
claim
here
relates
to
due
process
in
consideration
of
guilt
of
or
innocence
of
these
people.
mr.
donald
needle
well
i
don't
say
that
they
waive
it
sir
but
i
say
that
this
is
what
they
are
claiming
here.
mr.
donald
needle
then
i
would
assume
by
implication
that
the
question
would
be
here.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
your
honor
as
i
have
said,
i
agree
that
as
regards
to
the
sentencing
aspect
of
this
case,
this
evidence
certainly
would
have
been
useful.
mr.
donald
needle
well
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
donald
needle
had
they
known
what
we
all
--
what
is
known
now,
i
would
say
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well
if
your
honor
pleases
this
information,
the
post-conviction
proceeding
was
filed
30
months
after
the
conviction,
that
this
information
was
found
within
that
period
of
time.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
sir
that
there
was
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
needle
ordinarily
sir
that
is
the
normal
course
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
specific
evidence
that
there
was
one.
mr.
donald
needle
if
there
is
one,
the
defense
counsels
are
entitled
to
see
it.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
but
denied
being
in
the
room
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
mr.
donald
needle
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
lieutenant
whalen
denied
being
in
the
room
at
the
time
--
mr.
donald
needle
the
record
shows
sir
that
lieutenant
whalen
stated
that
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
the
doctor.
now
both
the
doctor
denied
and
lieutenant
whalen
denied
that
this
conversation
had
ever
taken
place
but
the
most
that
i
can
show
as
far
as
the
presence
of
lieutenant
whalen
at
that
particular
hearing
would
be
that
at
one
particular
point,
he
was
there
--
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
i
do
not
know
sir.
i
cannot
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
think
it
would
have
been
relevant
--
mr.
donald
needle
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
believe
that
this
was
--
this
particular
issue
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i'm
not
--
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
and
the
only
information
we
have
in
the
record
sir
is
lieutenant
whalen
denied.
mr.
donald
needle
being
in
the
room
and
this
is
in
our
position
of
course
to
this
petitioners
exhibit
number
3
for
identification
which
states
maryland
is
present
and
that
at
one
point
lieutenant
whalen
made
a
statement
that
he
had
spoken
to
the
doctor.
now,
if
the
actual
juvenile
records
of
the
court
if
your
honors
would
feel
that
they
are
important
as
relating
to
the
case
whereas
to
the
states
knowledge,
the
state
would
be
very
happy
to
include
certified
copies
--
mr.
donald
needle
well
your
honor
this
is
--
i'm
saying
we
--
mr.
donald
needle
--
do
not
know
what
was
in
those
particular
juvenile
court
records.
we've
never
seen
them.
mr.
donald
needle
apparently
it
is.
but
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
donald
needle
i'm
not
sure,
i
cannot
definitely
--
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
not
and
the
state
would
be
happy
and
would
offer
to
have
entered
into
the
record
before
this
court.
any
information
known
to
either
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
or
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
would
offer
that
for
the
court
consideration.
now
i've
stated
that
we,
in
the
attorney
general's
office
have
never
seen
it.
we
handle
the
appellate
trial
and
would
be
happy
to
offer
any
juvenile
court
records
for
whatever
relevance
they
might
shed
on
this
case.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
of
course,
your
honor
asking
me
to
make
a
concession
which
i
don't
think
this
case
calls
for.
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
maintain
that
we
did
not
have
all
of
this
knowledge
and
that
unless
you
can
first
find
that
we
did
that
we
don't
reach
this
particular
proposition.
mr.
donald
needle
perhaps
sir
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
post
conviction
trial
court
had
all
of
these
information.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
suggest
sir
that
the
post
conviction
trial
court
had
all
of
these
information
and
our
court
of
appeals
had
all
of
these
information.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
trial
court.
now,
this
information
therefore
was
wade
and
was
going
over
by
our
appellant
reviewing
authority.
and
our
highest
court
has
decided
that
this
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
show
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
the
record
as
far
as
my
recollection
is
was
to
void
of
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
and
my
impression
from
my
own
knowledge
of
this
case
is
that
the
judge
did
not
have
before
him
these
records
i
am
not
certain
but
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
he
did
it
and
it
wasn't
sure.
mr.
donald
needle
correct
sir,
that
was
my
impression.
mr.
donald
needle
conviction
sir
was
december
5,
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
sentencing
was
december
11,
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
particular
statute
my
counsel
is
--
mr.
donald
needle
if
your
honor
pleases,
this
is
a
practice
which
is
usually
done
by
our
maryland
court.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
making
this
a
necessity
or
demand.
but
it
is
the
practice,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
thank
you.
mr.
donald
needle
they
are
certainly
like
imprisonments.
mr.
donald
needle
15
years,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
in
1961
until
the
present
time
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
it
would
be
a
minimum
your
honor,
of
15
years
before
they
would
be
eligible
for
parole
probation.
but
of
course
they
are
at
this
point
considered
as
for
life
imprisonment.
mr.
donald
needle
the
testimony
concerning
this
sir
was
that
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
her
testimony
was
that
she
told
john
giles
the
first
of
the
defendants
to
find
her
lying
i
the
woods
that
if
he
would
help
her
move
back
further
she
was
only
30
feet
or
so
from
the
car
that
she
would
allow
him
to
have
intercourse
with
her
and
she
explained
this
statement
by
saying
that
she
hope
that
if
john
giles
who
had
found
her
would
let
her
get
back
out
of
the
way,
that
she
would
then
be
able
to
get
away
from
all
of
them.
although
a
literal
reading
of
the
record
suggest
that
joyce
roberts
was
the
first
person
to
mention
that.
however
--
mr.
donald
needle
at
the
top
page
of
66
sir
is
the
question,
now
joyce
when
this
boy
john
first
found
you,
didn't
you
tell
him,
if
he
would
help
you
get
away
that
you
would
let
him
have
a
little,
do
you
remember
that?
he
answered
yes
sir,
and
question
did
you
claim
to
let
him
have
a
little
if
you'd
help
him?
answer,
no
sir.
the
first
comments
or
in
this
case
concerning
sex
was
not
made
at
the
time
joyce
roberts
was
found.
what
was
made
at
the
car,
prior
to
the
time
that
it
was
demolished
and
broken
into.
so
the
first
question
in
this
case
concerning
sex
are
not
these
words
of
joyce
roberts.
mr.
donald
needle
but
an
alleged
statement
made
by
one
of
the
defendants
was
say
was
let's
drag
her
out
of
the
car
and
have
intercourse.
of
course,
the
words
used
were
not
quite
the
same
as
i
just
read.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
she
ran
from
the
car
after
the
statement
was
made.
mr.
donald
needle
thank
you
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
all
of
the
importance
really
of
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
because
of
the
gloss
which
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
perhaps
put
on
those
facts
that
should
be
reviewed.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
what
we're
talking
about
number
one
is
information
known
to
persons
in
two
counties
of
the
state
of
maryland
we're
talking
about
information
number
one
known
by
the
state's
attorney
leonard
kardy
of
montgomery
county.
we're
talking
about
information
known
by
lieutenant
whalen
the
chief
investigator
of
this
case
who
was
also
in
montgomery
county.
but
the
most
important
information
known
is
the
information
known
in
this
case
by
sergeant
wheeler
of
the
prince
george's
county
police.
the
other
most
important
information
in
this
case
also
prince
george's
county
information
is
located
number
one,
in
the
prince
george's
county
hospital
record;
and
number
two
in
a
juvenile
court
record
of
prince
george's
county.
now,
the
basis
of
our
brief
really
is
that
this
case
has
got
to
analyzed
in
proper
perspective.
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
ascertained
is
what
did
the
prosecution
includes
know,
or
what
is
the
prosecution
charge
for
it.
who
is
the
prosecution?
now
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
found
even
a
more
broad
rule
that
has
been
announced
in
the
past,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
prosecution
would
consist
in
this
case
of
kardy
the
state's
attorney
and
his
assistance
and
the
police
of
montgomery
county.
now,
notice
that
is
the
police
of
montgomery
county.
we
argue
that
information
known
not
only
by
kardy
in
this
case
by
perhaps
known
by
some
other
officer
in
montgomery
county
even
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
could
be
said
by
the
defense
analogy
in
this
case
to
be
imputable
to
the
prosecution.
now,
we
maintain
that
our
own
court
of
appeals
was
even
too
broad
that
what
should
be
known
by
the
prosecution
should
be
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
and
additionally
the
knowledge
of
the
investigating
officers.
now,
we
maintain
that
if
the
rule
is
any
different,
what
--
where
are
we
going
and
what
does
it
mean?
now,
montgomery
county
has
a
population
of
approximately
500,000
people
the
same
with
the
other
adjourning
county.
or
let's
look
at
jersey
city,
new
jersey,
and
let's
look
at
new
york
city.
is
every
police
officer
of
either
of
these
adjourning
municipalities
jurisdiction
to
know
number
one,
who
are
to
be
the
state
witnesses?
who
has
made
a
complaint
of
crime
and
is
to
testify
in
the
case?
are
all
state
or
municipal
police
officers
to
know
that
fact
much
less
whether
or
not
any
particular
piece
of
information
that
they
might
have
would
be
useful
if
they
don't
know
the
facts
of
the
case?
much
less,
what,
excuse
me
--
much
less
whether
a
particular
piece
of
information
that
they
might
have
about
a
witness
what
if
you
tell
what
it
would
be.
so
therefore,
we
claim
that
the
only
legitimate
rule
which
can
be
passed,
the
only
practical
test
of
prosecution
knowledge
can
be
that
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
prosecutor
and
his
assistants
and
his
agents.
and
secondly,
of
those
officers
that
investigated
the
case.
now
--
mr.
donald
needle
by
the
prosecutor
sir
i
mean
in
this
instance,
the
prosecutor
of
montgomery
county,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
donald
needle
he
and
his
agents
or
assistants
plus
montgomery
county
police
report.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
yes
sir.
of
course
the
question
is
moot
because
his
assistant
is
the
prosecutor
of
a
given
case.
so
the
question
of
who
is
in
compass
within
the
term
the
prosecution
i
say
would
be
the
state's
attorney
and
all
of
his
assistants.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir
i
would
say
too.
mr.
donald
needle
well
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
think
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
we're
splitting
here
really
talking
about
--
mr.
donald
needle
if
the
state's
attorney
has
not
in
fact
prosecuted
the
case
at
trial,
then
he
of
course
would
never
be
charged
with
suppressing
evidence.
it
would
be
the
person
that
prosecuted
the
case
that
would
be
charge
would
suppress
it.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
say
no
sir,
would
that
interest
in
the
case
is
of
the
prosecutor
and
any
information
that
his
subagents
might
have
given
him
and
would
have
aide
him
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
it
is.
mr.
donald
needle
no
--
mr.
donald
needle
we
don't
ask
you
to
narrow
it
sir
but
we
point
out
in
our
position
to
the
defense
claim
that
our
court
of
appeals
was
in
error.
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
needle
well,
we're
not
saying
it
was.
we're
pointing
out
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
case
was
that
we
can
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
harder
on
the
prosecution
than
it
had
to
be
and
it
gives
us
perhaps
a
greater
course
to
complain
that
it
would
give
the
defense
to
complain
because
of
the
future
possible
implication.
mr.
donald
needle
i
think
that
implication
can
be
read
into
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
of
course
--
mr.
donald
needle
the
course
came
out
with
an
odd
statement
that
the
prosecution
should
be
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
and
his
assistants
and
of
the
police
department
of
that
jurisdiction
which
has
the
control
or
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
and
that
in
the
next
sentence,
they
said,
this
would
mean
applying
to
this
case
that
our
interest
is
in
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
kardy
and
of
lieutenant
whalen
who
were
the
only
or
whalen
was
the
only
montgomery
county
officer
actually
involved.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
before
getting
further
into
the
legal
argument
of
this
case
that
the
state's
evidence
was
not
solely
the
evidence
of
joyce
roberts
against
the
evidence
of
petition.
and
our
case
was
not
an
uncorroborated
case.
the
evidence
was
clear.
this
joyce
roberts
only
16
years
old
did
go
out
to
patuxent
river
area
at
midnight.
and
she
went
out
there
with
three
boys.
but
the
evidence
is
clear
that
she
went
there
to
go
swimming
and
others
were
to
meet
them
there.
that
when
the
others
didn't
come
within
minutes,
they
left.
joyce
roberts
and
the
three
boys
started
to
go.
their
car
then
ran
out
of
gas.
two
of
the
three
boys
out
with
joyce
roberts
in
that
car
left
to
get
gas,
leaving
joyce
roberts
and
stewart
foster
in
that
car.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
giles
boys
who
had
been
swimming
and
fishing
came
upon
the
scene
and
they
saw
the
car.
and
of
course
this
is
where
the
evidence
becomes
conflicted.
the
giles
boys
testified
in
the
trial
that
the
reason
that
they
broke
into
that
car,
the
windows
were
locked
--
the
windows
were
closed,
the
doors
were
locked.
but
the
reason
why
they
shattered
those
windows
of
that
car
and
drags
foster
out
of
that
car
and
not
being
conscious
was
because
they
claim
that
stewart
foster
had
a
gun
in
that
car.
now
here
is
stewart
foster
in
that
car,
joyce
roberts
in
that
car
and
here
are
three
persons
that
are
opposed
to
this
one
other
man.
now,
the
complete
and
credulous
proposition
that
was
forwarded
by
the
defense
just
didn't
support
the
proposition.
so
you
have
a
demolished
car
to
corroborate
the
state's
case.
you
have
stewart
foster
found
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
the
first
police
officer
who
arrived
on
the
scene,
you
find
him
bloody,
you
find
him
hysteric,
you
find
that
he's
taken
and
rushed
to
the
hospital
and
given
eight
stitches.
you
find
joyce
roberts
lying
on
the
ground,
well
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
first
police
officer
on
the
scene.
mr.
donald
needle
joyce
roberts
sir,
the
prosecuting
witness.
the
first
police
officer
that
arrived
on
the
scene
testified
of
what
he
found
and
described
foster's
condition
which
i
have
just
related
and
then
described
what
he
found
as
far
as
joyce
roberts'
condition.
she
was
found
lying
on
the
ground
with
her
blouse
on
open
in
a
semiconscious
condition.
the
police
officer
and
stewart
foster
had
to
pick
joyce
vilely
up
off
of
the
ground
and
help
her
get
dressed.
she
was
taken
to
the
hospital.
now,
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
hospital
record,
of
any
force?
well,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
doctor
testified
for
the
state
at
the
trial
that
there
were
operations
of
the
shoulders,
of
the
legs,
and
of
the
neck
of
the
prosecuting
witness.
they
further
testified
that
there
were
leaves,
there
were
dirt
and
grass
adherent
to
the
back
of
her
body.
there
were
numerous
spermatozoa
cells
found
in
the
vagina.
now,
we
maintain
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
uncorroborated
testimony
of
a
prosecuting
witness
which
has
served
now
to
place
three
persons
in
jail
that
the
state's
case
was
fully
corroborated.
now,
the
prosecutor
knew
this
evidence
ahead
of
time.
in
addition
to
that,
the
prosecutor
spoke
to
and
interviewed
joyce
roberts.
he
spoke
to
her
before
the
giles
case.
he
spoke
to
her
before
the
johnson
case
which
was
held
there.
he
had
an
interview
with
the
defense
counsel,
mr.
steven
prescott.
he
told
the
defense
counsel
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
this
girl
was
100%
that
there
was
nothing
as
far
as
he
knew
that
would
cast
any
aspersions
whatsoever
on
her
credibility.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
found
that
by
the
giles
version
of
this
incident
to
their
own
counsel.
their
own
counsel
must
have
known,
number
one,
that
this
girl
was
a
sexually
promiscuous
girl
and
that
her
background
was
not
of
the
finest.
there
was
evidence
in
other
words
which
the
defense
counsel
knew
wherein
the
court
of
appeals
said
which
should
have
been
investigated.
mr.
forer
has
named
certain
things
the
defense
of
the
case
was
that
joyce
roberts
had
told
these
defendants
that
she
had
that
same
week
engaged
in
intercourse
with
16
other
persons.
now,
if
that
was
true,
and
if
the
defense
counsel
knew
that,
was
there
any
obligation
on
the
defense
counsel
to
go
and
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
was
any
truth
in
this
assertion.
now,
what
did
the
defense
counsel
do?
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
there
was
no
request
for
investigators.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
know
your
honor
of
any
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
and
he
was
assigned
in
september
and
had
approximately
three
months
to
prepare
for
this
case.
now,
what
was
the
preparation?
number
one,
he
claims
that
he
went
to
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
because
the
petitioners
had
allegedly
been
told
by
joyce
roberts
that
she
was
on
probation
and
that
if
she
was
caught
she
would
have
to
claim
rape.
they
went
to
the
juvenile
court
because
they
had
an
indication
that
the
juvenile
court
might
have
something.
but
they
weren't
allowed
to
see
the
juvenile
court
records.
why?
because
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
our
appendix,
maryland
rule
922
said
that
in
order
to
see
a
record
of
the
juvenile
case,
you
must
seek
and
obtain
the
permission
of
the
judge.
now,
it
is
admitted
that
this
was
not
sought.
now,
wouldn't
that
in
and
of
itself
the
simple
matter
of
getting
a
judge's
signature
permission
to
see
a
record,
does
this
in
itself
show
a
lack
of
diligence?
mr.
donald
needle
if
you
will
look
at
--
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
the
record
which
is
the
petitioner's
exhibit
number
three
in
which
i
had
pointed
out
as
for
verification
which
mr.
forer
pointed
related
to
a
hearing
on
september
the
5th
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
now,
this
record
would
have
been
available
had
the
proper
procedural
pattern
been
followed.
mr.
donald
needle
there
is
no
direct
testimony
in
the
record
sir,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
this
is
not
in
the
record.
as
i
said
the
record
is
not
clear.
the
only
testimony
we
have
on
this
point
is
that
of
mr.
prescott
himself.
now,
he
did
not
deny
that
there
was
a
record,
or
he
did
not
state
that
he
was
told
that
there
was
no
record
there.
mr.
donald
needle
he
stated
sir
that
he
attempted
to
see
the
record
but
could
not
and
that
was
--
that
is
the
only
thing
that
we
have
here
before
us
as
far
as
testimony
concerning
this
point.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
he
didn't
go
further.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
mr.
prescott
of
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
oh
no,
not
at
the
--
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
post
conviction
hearing
sir
was
in
july
of
1963.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
the
july
of
1964
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
he
was
put
on
the
stand
by
the
petitioner
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct
too.
mr.
prescott's
testimony
if
your
honor
please
appears
--
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
the
extent
testimony
with
that
particular
court.
now
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
say
that
sir,
but
i
would
say
that
you
could
also
infer
from
that
could
then
had
knowledge
that
there
were
in
fact
reference
concerning
this
girl.
now,
once
he
knew
that
did
he
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
talking
about
here.
he
--
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
does
he
did
not,
nor
he
did
ask
the
state's
attorney
for
assistance.
now,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
for
mr.
kardy's
testimony
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
had
a
request
been
made
of
him
for
assistance,
he
would
have
gotten
the
trial
judge's
permission
on
behalf
of
the
defense
counsel,
so
that
these
records
would
have
been
made
available.
now,
this
is
the
juvenile
court
record.
now,
prince
george's
county
hospital
record
would
show
that
joyce
roberts
had
attempted
suicide.
this
was
the
admitting
diagnosis
that
showed
also
that
this
episode
is
related
to
a
rape
several
weeks
ago.
now,
prince
george's
--
this
prince
george's
county
hospital
record
was
admittedly
unknown
to
anyone
who
may
be
considered
within
the
term
“the
prosecution.”
the
only
--
there
is
in
fact
no
evidence
that
anyone
even
including
the
prince
george's
county
sergeant
that
would
be
sergeant
wheeler
who
visited
joyce
in
the
hospital
never
saw
that
hospital
record.
so
that
hospital
record
is
of
prince
george's
county
hospital
which
was
discovered
three
years
after
this
trial
by
the
defense
counsel.
in
which
they're
claiming
now
that
the
prosecution
should
have
noted
that
and
should
have
discovered.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
the
they
in
there
sir
is
the
juvenile
court
authority
because
the
juvenile
or
the
clerk
of
the
juvenile
court
who
under
maryland
rule
922
which
i
set
out
in
our
appendix
was
not
authorized.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is,
yes
sir.
now,
the
second
matter
--
mr.
donald
needle
the
juvenile
court
proceedings?
mr.
donald
needle
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
exhibit
which
is
in
the
record
is
not
in
evidence.
now
this
is
petitioner's
exhibit
number
3
for
identification.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
now
you
notice
that
this
is
the
petitioner's
exhibit
three
for
identification.
now,
this
was
never
offered
into
evidence
--
mr.
donald
needle
this
as
far
as
my
--
mr.
donald
needle
--
refreshing
my
recollection
of
this
exhibit
--
mr.
donald
needle
well
this
is
correct
sir,
but
this
has
nothing
about
sexual
promiscuity
which
is
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
needle
the
point
is
as
far
as
prosecution
knowledge
of
this
report
there
was
none.
now,
lieutenant
whalen
testified
that
although
he
attended
this
particular
hearing
on
september
the
5th,
now
whalen
is
again
from
montgomery
county
and
in
charge
of
this
investigation.
although
he
attended
that
hearing
he
was
never
in
the
courtroom
except
when
he
testified
and
whalen
never
saw
this
report
and
it
is
admitted
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
no
one
or
the
prosecution
ever
saw
this
report.
so
in
direct
answer
to
your
question
sir
that
this
report
show
that
this
girl
was
sexually
promiscuous,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
if
your
honor
pleases
the
record
on
this
--
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
this
was
brought
by
mrs.
roberts,
the
mother
of
joyce
roberts.
mr.
donald
needle
who
had
visited
a
friend
mrs.
patterson,
a
probation
officer
in
the
prince
george's
county
juvenile
court
and
that
joyce
had
been
keeping
late
out
and
this
was
the
basis
of
the
mother's
petition
back
in
april
of
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
what
the
record
shows,
so
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
donald
needle
no,
the
record
in
the
juvenile
court.
now
the
petition
had
been
filed
by
mrs.
roberts
back
in
april
of
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
now
the
hearing
--
mr.
donald
needle
it
showed
that
there
was
a
complaint
made
by
mrs.
roberts
that
her
daughter
was
out
of
parental
control.
now,
that
was
explained
by
mrs.
roberts
during
her
testimony
--
mr.
donald
needle
it
showed
that
joyce
roberts
was
out
of
parental
control.
mr.
donald
needle
the
petition
sir
was
never
offered
in
evidence
per
se.
we
don't
find
it
in
the
petition.
mr.
donald
needle
we
don't
know
sir.
we
know
what
was
in
this
--
what
is
in
this
record
and
what
was
introduced
in
the
lower
court.
now,
that
petition
has
never
been
introduced.
there
is
only
a
stipulation
in
this
record
stating
what
it
contained.
and
it
contained
a
statement
that
mrs.
roberts
had
filed
a
petition
stating
that
joyce
roberts
is
out
of
parental
control.
that
a
case
worker
investigated
this
complaint
and
suggested
that
joyce
roberts
be
placed
on
probation.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
this
was
an
oral
stipulation
between
the
state's
attorney
and
the
defense
counsel
at
the
post-conviction
hearing.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
it's
on
page
174
of
the
brief.
mr.
donald
needle
on
page
174
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
donald
needle
it
was
never
officially
offered
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
it
was
only
offered
for
identification,
there
was
no
motion
to
offer
it
into
evidence,
only
for
identification.
and
this
was
pointed
out
on
numerous
tons
by
mr.
kardy
whenever
the
counsel
made
reference
to
this
particular
record.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
your
honor
please,
the
initial
petition
in
this
case
concerning
joyce
roberts
which
ended
in
a
hearing
on
september
the
fifth
in
montgomery
county
had
been
filed
in
prince
george's
county.
and
that
is
the
same
hearing
that
we're
talking
about
on
the
stipulation.
mr.
donald
needle
yes.
now,
the
reason
that
that
was
transferred
to
montgomery
county
and
we
point
that
out
in
our
brief
is
that
subsequent
to
the
date
of
april
the
4th
when
this
initial
prince
george's
county
petition
was
sought,
joyce
roberts
and
her
family
had
been
subjected
to
gross
harassment.
the
mother
had
requested
lieutenant
whalen
to
have
her
placed
in
protective
custody.
and
lieutenant
whalen
called
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
of
montgomery
county
and
told
the
judge
of
that
court
that
this
girl
is
to
be
a
necessary
witness
in
the
state's
case.
a
hearing
therefore
was
held
in
montgomery
county
and
it
concerned
therefore
the
original
facts
contained
in
this
stipulation
plus
the
fact
that
the
state
wanted
her
held
for
her
own
protective
custody.
and
that's
why
the
hearing
was
held
in
montgomery.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
what
i
just
explained
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
yes.
it
wasn't
the
giles
case.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
but
no
charge
ever
made
this
report
refers
only
to
the
giles
case.
mr.
donald
needle
there
were
three
involved
sir.
but
they
were
treated
as
distinct
cases.
the
giles
brothers
is
one
case
because
a
severance
had
been
asked
as
far
as
the
third
party
was
concerned.
so,
if
i
might
continue
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
then
is
not
only
a
question
of
uncorroborated
testimony.
but
a
grossly
clear
picture
drawn
by
the
state
is
to
what
occurred
on
that
night.
now,
very
briefly,
we
maintain
that
other
than
the
question
of
the
utility
of
information
which
is
the
only
rule
which
mr.
forer
suggests
as
the
court
contests
that
there
are
many,
many
other
factors
in
this
case
to
be
given
very
serious
consideration
before
any
one
rule
can
be
made
to
be
imposed
upon
the
states
under
the
due
process
clause.
consideration
has
got
to
be
given
as
i
pointed
out
number
one,
what
did
the
state
know
or
what
was
the
state
chargeable
with
knowing?
consideration
has
got
to
be
given,
we
maintain,
to
what
did
the
defense
know
or
what
was
the
defense
chargeable
with
knowing.
now,
as
relates
to
the
evidence
itself,
consideration
must
be
given
not
only
to
usefulness
of
that
information.
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
admissibility
of
that
information.
again,
to
the
discoverability
of
that
information
under
existing
rules
of
discovery
and
inspection
available
in
the
states.
now,
maryland
rule
728
which
is
said
out
in
this
petition
is
broader
than
federal
rule
16.
under
neither
rule
would
any
of
these
evidence
have
been
discoverable
in
a
manner
of
pretrial
discovery
had
it
been
requested.
now,
we
state
that
this
is
a
very
important
factor
to
be
determined
along
with
the
mere
question
of
possible
usefulness
of
this
information.
it's
discoverability.
it's
availability.
now,
was
this
evidence
merely
cumulative
or
impeaching?
now,
if
it
was
so,
it
would
not
have
been
material
exculpatory
evidence.
and
finally,
was
the
evidence
contradictory
of
anything
that
happened
in
the
trial?
the
answer
is
no.
the
evidence
was
not
contradictory
of
anything
that
happened
in
the
trial.
now,
the
only
aspect
that
mr.
forer
can
point
to
trying
to
show
some
semblance
of
contradiction
would
be
the
fact
that
joyce
roberts
denied
that
she
was
on
probation.
however,
the
stipulation
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
prior
thereto
she
was
not
on
probation.
she
never
was
on
probation
and
still
--
and
is
not
now.
so
there
is
no
contradiction
of
any
trial
testimony.
so
we
maintain
that
before
a
rule
can
be
passed
in
this
case
that
the
state
must
disclose
not
only
what
it
knows
but
what
it
maybe
should
find
that
very
careful
consideration
has
got
to
be
given
to
these
other
factors,
to
what
the
state
really
knew
to
the
question
of
due
diligence
and
equal
availability
of
this
knowledge
to
the
defense
to
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
this
information
to
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
could
have
been
discovered
even
had
it
been
asked
and
note
finally
that
in
the
brady
case,
one
of
the
questions
or
one
of
the
prerequisites
to
relief
was
that
a
request
for
information
has
to
be
made.
now,
our
court
of
appeals
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
showed
that
these
defendants
must
have
known
--
must
have
known
of
the
character
and
reputation
of
this
girl
or
at
least
had
something
that
it
should
have
gone
and
investigate.
now,
we
maintain
sir
that
no
case
has
ever
held
so
far
as
we
now
that
unless
the
state
has
exclusive
knowledge
of
information
that
the
defense
knows
that
and
that
is
the
exclusive
knowledge
of
information
within
its
own
control
that
is
equally
available
to
the
defense
counsel
that
a
suppression
has
been
maintained
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
we
maintain
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
imposes
not
so
broad
an
obligation
as
that
which
is
sought
here.
we
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
say
that
a
prosecutor
is
to
prosecute
with
earnest
and
as
vigor.
you
have
said
that
in
the
burger
case
and
we
maintain
that
what
the
prosecution
is
precluded
from
doing
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
from
becoming
a
partisan
but
by
having
his
partisan
should
turn
into
impartiality
to
become
impartial
to
the
extent
of
being
disequal
of
to
the
extent
of
being
desized.
mr.
donald
needle
mr.
kardy
sir,
leonard
kardy.
mr.
donald
needle
if
you
honor
pleases,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
don't
know
that
the
state's
attorney
could
give
you
a
quick
answer
on
that.
i
would
say
that
he
has
got
to
weigh
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
say
yes
sir
because
those
facts
are
then
completely
exculpatory
facts
these
are
facts
that
are
not
just
--
mr.
donald
needle
oh,
well
then
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
donald
needle
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
it
would
not
have
to
disclose
these
facts.
mr.
donald
needle
because
number
one
sir,
this
evidence
in
maryland
under
maryland
law
of
prior
false
rate
claim
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
maryland
law.
yes
sir
and
i
have
pointed
out
the
cases
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
only
--
not
a
prior
false
rape
claim
sir
but
we
maintain
we
have
here
not
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
needle
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
specifically
held
sir
that
evidence
of
a
prior
false
rape
claim
is
not
admissible
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
a
witness.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
if
your
honor
pleases,
this
evidence
as
long
as
it
does
not
relate
to
specific
acts
would
be
admissible.
specific
acts
of
misconduct
--
mr.
donald
needle
--
are
not
admissible
but
general
reputation
would
be
admissible.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
know
whether
he
has
the
fourteenth
amendment
duty
sir.
he
might
have
a
moral
obligation
to
it
because
this
would
be
admissible
evidence.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
i
don't
know
how
i
can
honestly
answer
you
sir.
i
say
that
as
far
as
the
constitutional
issue
is
concerned
that
there
should
be
no
positive
duty
on
them
to
do
so
because
the
question
is
not
merely
that
of
admissibility
and
the
question
is
not
merely
that
of
usefulness.
you
have
got
to
add
to
that
other
factors
and
other
factors
or
did
the
defendant
know
it?
what
was
the
real
extent
of
the
prosecution
knowledge?
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
agree
to
that
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
donald
needle
they
threw,
your
honor
pleases,
large
rocks
and
boulders
into
that
car
and
shattered
all
the
windows
in
that
car.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
--
evidence
sir
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
donald
needle
the
excuse
that
they
gave
sir
was
that
stewart
foster
leaned
down
in
the
backseat
of
the
car
as
though
he
were
reaching
for
a
gun
and
in
order
to
prevent
foster
from
shooting
them,
they
broke
into
the
car.
mr.
donald
needle
they
claim
sir
that
they
wanted
to
prevent
foster
from
shooting
them.
that
was
the
extent
of
their
explanation.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
was
that
the
--
was
that
the
beginning
of
the
episode?
that
they
just
saw
him
reaching
down
to
the
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
donald
needle
well
no
sir.
prior
to
that
time
there
had
been
a
conversation.
mr.
donald
needle
in
which
the
--
mr.
donald
needle
well
they
claimed
--
the
defense
claimed
that
the
state
provoked
this
by
using
certain
racial
epithets.
mr.
donald
needle
by
using
certain
racial
epithets.
the
--
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
right,
that
is
the
answer
sir.
now,
the
chronology
of
the
events
were
that
one
of
the
boys
asked
stewart
foster
for
a
cigarette.
foster
said
he
had
no
cigarettes.
one
of
the
boys
then
asked
foster
for
money.
foster
said
he
had
no
money.
the
boys
then
went
behind
the
stalled
vehicle
in
which
joyce
and
foster
were
in.
it's
at
this
point
where
the
defendants
claim
they
saw
stewart
foster
bending
down
as
so
reaching
for
something.
they
also
claim
that
foster
had
called
them
certain
racial
names
that
there
had
been
an
argument.
and
because
of
these
names
and
because
foster
was
reaching
down
that
it
was
then
that
they
broke
the
windows.
so
there
had
been
a
conversation
of
course
prior
to
the
rocks
being
thrown.
now,
what
was
said
is
a
question
of
interpretation,
the
state's
interpretation
where
the
state's
evidence
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
provoke
this
attack.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
answer
your
honor
that
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
impose
that
obligation
in
this
case
because
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
are
now
all
cumulatively
known.
number
one
would
not
have
been
admissible
in
evidence.
they
--
we
admit
would
have
been
useful.
but
--
mr.
donald
needle
useful
sir.
but
we
maintain
sir
that
utility
of
information
is
not
to
be
considered
by
itself
that
there
are
even
with
all
of
these
cumulative
evidence
too
many
other
factors
involved
here.
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
the
fact
that
the
evidence
could
not
have
been
discovered
under
the
maryland
rules
and
the
implications
that
would
be
drawn
by
the
state
having
to
give
this
type
of
information.
we
maintain
sir
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
there
would
have
been
no
obligation
on
the
state's
attorney
had
he
known
all
of
these
evidence
cumulatively
even
as
opposed
to
what
he
in
fact
didn't
know.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
answer
no
sir
that
with
all
of
these
information
cumulatively
that
what
it
now
shows
would
not
have
precluded
or
did
not
prevent
the
petitioner
from
obtaining
a
fair
trial.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
i
think
in
that
regard
that
perhaps
this
evidence
might
under
a
moral
obligation
have
been
disclosed
as
regard
to
the
issue
of
sentence
but
i
point
out
also
in
answer
to
your
question
to
that
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
here
is
not
that
this
evidence
related
so
much
to
the
sentencing
because
that's
really
a
moot
question
at
this
point
since
the
sentence
has
been
commuted
by
the
governor.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
perhaps
it's
not
moot
sir
but
perhaps
i
(voice
overlap).
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that
perhaps
that
the
better
answer
is
that
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
goes
to
the
due
process
aspect
of
the
fairness
of
the
trial
as
regards
their
guilt
or
innocence
not
as
regards
the
punishment
to
be
imposed.
and
i
think
the
claim
here
relates
to
due
process
in
consideration
of
guilt
of
or
innocence
of
these
people.
mr.
donald
needle
well
i
don't
say
that
they
waive
it
sir
but
i
say
that
this
is
what
they
are
claiming
here.
mr.
donald
needle
then
i
would
assume
by
implication
that
the
question
would
be
here.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
your
honor
as
i
have
said,
i
agree
that
as
regards
to
the
sentencing
aspect
of
this
case,
this
evidence
certainly
would
have
been
useful.
mr.
donald
needle
well
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
donald
needle
had
they
known
what
we
all
--
what
is
known
now,
i
would
say
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well
if
your
honor
pleases
this
information,
the
post-conviction
proceeding
was
filed
30
months
after
the
conviction,
that
this
information
was
found
within
that
period
of
time.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
sir
that
there
was
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
needle
ordinarily
sir
that
is
the
normal
course
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
specific
evidence
that
there
was
one.
mr.
donald
needle
if
there
is
one,
the
defense
counsels
are
entitled
to
see
it.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
but
denied
being
in
the
room
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
mr.
donald
needle
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
lieutenant
whalen
denied
being
in
the
room
at
the
time
--
mr.
donald
needle
the
record
shows
sir
that
lieutenant
whalen
stated
that
he
had
had
a
conversation
with
the
doctor.
now
both
the
doctor
denied
and
lieutenant
whalen
denied
that
this
conversation
had
ever
taken
place
but
the
most
that
i
can
show
as
far
as
the
presence
of
lieutenant
whalen
at
that
particular
hearing
would
be
that
at
one
particular
point,
he
was
there
--
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
i
do
not
know
sir.
i
cannot
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
think
it
would
have
been
relevant
--
mr.
donald
needle
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
this
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
believe
that
this
was
--
this
particular
issue
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i'm
not
--
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
needle
and
the
only
information
we
have
in
the
record
sir
is
lieutenant
whalen
denied.
mr.
donald
needle
being
in
the
room
and
this
is
in
our
position
of
course
to
this
petitioners
exhibit
number
3
for
identification
which
states
maryland
is
present
and
that
at
one
point
lieutenant
whalen
made
a
statement
that
he
had
spoken
to
the
doctor.
now,
if
the
actual
juvenile
records
of
the
court
if
your
honors
would
feel
that
they
are
important
as
relating
to
the
case
whereas
to
the
states
knowledge,
the
state
would
be
very
happy
to
include
certified
copies
--
mr.
donald
needle
well
your
honor
this
is
--
i'm
saying
we
--
mr.
donald
needle
--
do
not
know
what
was
in
those
particular
juvenile
court
records.
we've
never
seen
them.
mr.
donald
needle
apparently
it
is.
but
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
donald
needle
i'm
not
sure,
i
cannot
definitely
--
mr.
donald
needle
that
is
not
and
the
state
would
be
happy
and
would
offer
to
have
entered
into
the
record
before
this
court.
any
information
known
to
either
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
or
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
would
offer
that
for
the
court
consideration.
now
i've
stated
that
we,
in
the
attorney
general's
office
have
never
seen
it.
we
handle
the
appellate
trial
and
would
be
happy
to
offer
any
juvenile
court
records
for
whatever
relevance
they
might
shed
on
this
case.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
well,
of
course,
your
honor
asking
me
to
make
a
concession
which
i
don't
think
this
case
calls
for.
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
maintain
that
we
did
not
have
all
of
this
knowledge
and
that
unless
you
can
first
find
that
we
did
that
we
don't
reach
this
particular
proposition.
mr.
donald
needle
perhaps
sir
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
post
conviction
trial
court
had
all
of
these
information.
mr.
donald
needle
i
would
suggest
sir
that
the
post
conviction
trial
court
had
all
of
these
information
and
our
court
of
appeals
had
all
of
these
information.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
trial
court.
now,
this
information
therefore
was
wade
and
was
going
over
by
our
appellant
reviewing
authority.
and
our
highest
court
has
decided
that
this
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
show
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
the
record
as
far
as
my
recollection
is
was
to
void
of
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
and
my
impression
from
my
own
knowledge
of
this
case
is
that
the
judge
did
not
have
before
him
these
records
i
am
not
certain
but
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
he
did
it
and
it
wasn't
sure.
mr.
donald
needle
correct
sir,
that
was
my
impression.
mr.
donald
needle
conviction
sir
was
december
5,
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
sentencing
was
december
11,
1961.
mr.
donald
needle
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
particular
statute
my
counsel
is
--
mr.
donald
needle
if
your
honor
pleases,
this
is
a
practice
which
is
usually
done
by
our
maryland
court.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
making
this
a
necessity
or
demand.
but
it
is
the
practice,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
thank
you.
mr.
donald
needle
they
are
certainly
like
imprisonments.
mr.
donald
needle
15
years,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
in
1961
until
the
present
time
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
that's
correct.
it
would
be
a
minimum
your
honor,
of
15
years
before
they
would
be
eligible
for
parole
probation.
but
of
course
they
are
at
this
point
considered
as
for
life
imprisonment.
mr.
donald
needle
the
testimony
concerning
this
sir
was
that
--
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir,
her
testimony
was
that
she
told
john
giles
the
first
of
the
defendants
to
find
her
lying
i
the
woods
that
if
he
would
help
her
move
back
further
she
was
only
30
feet
or
so
from
the
car
that
she
would
allow
him
to
have
intercourse
with
her
and
she
explained
this
statement
by
saying
that
she
hope
that
if
john
giles
who
had
found
her
would
let
her
get
back
out
of
the
way,
that
she
would
then
be
able
to
get
away
from
all
of
them.
although
a
literal
reading
of
the
record
suggest
that
joyce
roberts
was
the
first
person
to
mention
that.
however
--
mr.
donald
needle
at
the
top
page
of
66
sir
is
the
question,
now
joyce
when
this
boy
john
first
found
you,
didn't
you
tell
him,
if
he
would
help
you
get
away
that
you
would
let
him
have
a
little,
do
you
remember
that?
he
answered
yes
sir,
and
question
did
you
claim
to
let
him
have
a
little
if
you'd
help
him?
answer,
no
sir.
the
first
comments
or
in
this
case
concerning
sex
was
not
made
at
the
time
joyce
roberts
was
found.
what
was
made
at
the
car,
prior
to
the
time
that
it
was
demolished
and
broken
into.
so
the
first
question
in
this
case
concerning
sex
are
not
these
words
of
joyce
roberts.
mr.
donald
needle
but
an
alleged
statement
made
by
one
of
the
defendants
was
say
was
let's
drag
her
out
of
the
car
and
have
intercourse.
of
course,
the
words
used
were
not
quite
the
same
as
i
just
read.
mr.
donald
needle
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
needle
no
sir,
she
ran
from
the
car
after
the
statement
was
made.
mr.
donald
needle
thank
you
sir.
