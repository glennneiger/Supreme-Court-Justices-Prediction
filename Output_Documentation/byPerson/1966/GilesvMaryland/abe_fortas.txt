justice
abe
fortas
mr.
forer,
suppose
this
is
not
a
rape
case,
but
suppose
it
were
a
case
of
grand
larceny
and
a
witness
testified
against
the
defendant.
and
let's
suppose
the
state
knew
that
this
witness
had
some
sort
of
a
record,
or
had
been
arrest
let's
say
without
being
convicted.
and
this
witness
had
himself
arrested.
is
it
your
feeling
that
the
state
is
required
to
disclose
information
of
that
character?
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
is
a
matter
of
degree?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
incidents
that
are
here
involved
and
into
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
degree
that
is
to
say,
what
are
the
given
on
the
court
proceeding,
i
think
that
it
was
free
the
alleged
rape
incident
that
was
the
point
of
the
alleged
rape
incident.
justice
abe
fortas
the
other
incident
was
after
the
alleged
rape.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
i
say
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
state's
duty
to
disclose
events
or
conditions
or
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
crime.
on
the
one
hand
and
the
state's
duty
on
the
other
hand
to
disclose
circumstances
which
arose
subsequent
to
and
might
arguably
or
conceivably
shed
some
light
on
the
prosecuting
witnesses
and
mental
condition.
justice
abe
fortas
material,
of
course
there
was
material
to
what
i
suppose.
justice
abe
fortas
because
here
you're
not
--
this
is
not
a
--
what
you're
saying
is
this
--
the
information
in
your
view
of
the
case
is
material
to
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
us
what
you
mean
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
suppose
that
the
top
state's
attorney
to
tell
whatever
it
is
and
montgomery
county
--
suppose
the
state's
attorney
for
montgomery
county
i
don't
know
what
it's
called,
will
include
him
and
then
would
you
include
the
file
staff
all
of
the
lawyers
on
the
file
staff
along
with
the
lawyers
who
investigate
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
include
the
head
of
the
--
would
you
include
the
head
of
the
office
whether
or
not
he
was
engaged
on
the
particular
case
that's
when
i'm
really
asking
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
whether
or
not
the
state's
attorney
was
actually
engaged
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
so,
you
had
made
a
distinction
between
that
and
the
police.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
so
far
as
the
police
i'm
really
just
trying
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
get
exact
what
you
are
pointing
and
i
assume
we're
going
to
talk
about
--
i
understand
what
you
said,
you
would
place,
you
would
impute
our
views
as
a
practical
knowledge
of
dispute.
whatever
is
known
by
the
state's
attorney,
the
attorney
for
the
county
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
trial
staff
of
the
lawyers
and
the
investigating
staff,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
if
i
correctly
understood
you
so
far
as
the
police
are
concerned,
we
would
include
only
the
police
who
were
actively
engaged
in
that
particular
investigation.
justice
abe
fortas
or
maybe
i
adhere
to
you
but
--
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
want
to
know
whose
knowledge
we're
talking
about
not
who
has
charged
the
suppression.
the
united
states
attorney
has
knowledge
about
a
prosecuting
witness
which
the
attorney
who
is
actually
in
charge
of
the
specific
trial
of
the
case
is
not
held.
is
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
in
your
view,
to
be
chargeable
to
the
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
now
i'm
getting
to
understand
you.
i
think
now
what
you're
saying
is
that
you're
entitled
to
look
only
to
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
officials
who
are
specifically
engaged
in
the
trial
and
investigation
of
the
case
excluding
those
officials
who
may
have
a
nominal
official
responsibility.
justice
abe
fortas
have
i
got
your
position
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
only
respect
in
which
court
of
appeals
is
broader
in
the
view
that
you
think
is
correct
is
to
include
all
of
the
police
in
montgomery
county,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
know
just
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
as
i
understood
your
prior
statement,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
prosecution
is
chargeable
with
the
knowledge
that
mr.
kardy
and
his
assistant
and
with
the
knowledge
of
all
of
the
police
in
montgomery
county,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
when
i
hope
this
is
a
very
simple
question.
i
hope
it
is.
let's
suppose
that
the
prosecuting
attorney,
what
was
his
name?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
let's
suppose
that
he
personally
knew
that
the
prosecuting
witness
had
made
a
complaint
to
the
police
to
get
them
out
where,
tell
the
police
that
she
had
been
raped
by
two
men
and
that
it
had
been
established
that
that
statement
that
she
made
was
false
and
that
she
had
been
a
knowing
and
willing
participant
in
the
act
whereupon
the
police
dropped
on
that.
now
the
police
assumed
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
knew
what
i
have
just
stated
to
you.
now,
is
it
in
your
position
that
he
does
or
does
not,
that
he
would
or
would
not
have
had
the
duty
to
inform
the
defense
of
those
facts
that
when
they
get
to
firmly
that's
a
question
that
is
susceptible
with
fairly
direct
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
but
for
your
view,
as
to
whether
he
had
a
duty
and
no
circumstances
to
disclose
the
facts
that
i
narrowed
as
to
the
defense.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
they
are
not
completely
exculpatory
at
all.
this
was
another
incident
involving
other
people.
justice
abe
fortas
you
currently
stated
that
it's
clearly
as
i
put.
justice
abe
fortas
the
state's
attorney
has
knowledge
that
in
other
instance
involving
other
men
at
another
time
the
prosecuting
witness
complained
to
the
police
that
she
had
been
raped.
the
police
investigated
and
they
concluded
that
the
prosecuting
witness
had
not
been
raped
but
there
was
no
basis
for
such
a
charge
that
the
prosecuting
witness
had
been
a
willing
cooperator
in
the
venture.
in
those
circumstances,
then
along
comes
the
giles
case.
those
circumstances,
is
it
or
is
it
not
in
your
theory
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
must
disclose
these
facts
to
the
defense?
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me
why.
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
not
be
admissible
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
respect
to
the
credibility
of
the
prosecuting
witness.
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
not
be
available
for
use
by
the
defense
on
cross-examination
as
to
credibility,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that
but
i'm
not
asking
about
the
--
i'm
asking
you
to
confine
yourself
to
this
(voice
overlap)
--
confine
yourself
to
this
hypothetical
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
suppose
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
where
the
court
record
that
showed
that
the
prosecuting
witness
had
been
exceedingly
permissible.
would
the
prosecuting
attorney
have
a
duty
on
these
circumstances
to
disclose
that
to
the
defense?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
same
reason?
justice
abe
fortas
same
reason?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now,
the
prosecuting
attorney
knows
this
general
reputation
and
your
submission
does
the
prosecuting
attorney
have
a
duty
to
disclose
that
to
the
defense?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
answering
in
both
ways.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
believe
if
the
defense
counsel
knew
or
should
upon
reasonable
investigation
have
known
then
there's
no
duty
on
the
prosecution
to
make
disclosure.
is
that
your
submission?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
state's
counsel
agreed
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
