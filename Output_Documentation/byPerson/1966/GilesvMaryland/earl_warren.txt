more
question,
is
there
any
in
that
original
petition
for
make
a
reward
of
their
sex
background
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
being
beyond
parental
control?
chief
justice
earl
warren
kardy
was
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
kardy
was
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer,
did
i
understand
you
did
say
that
at
the
trial,
she
testified
that
she
was
the
first
one
to
speak
of
sex
to
the
boys
and
then
she
offered
to
have
intercourse
with
one
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer
before
you
get
on
to
your
other
point,
do
you
said
that
the
prosecutor
ridiculed
the
idea
of
her
being
on
probation,
would
you
elaborate
on
that
a
little
and
how
it
came
up
and
what
he
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
prosecutor
indicate
in
any
way
the
square
was
not
on
probation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
you
told
has
been
saying
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
give
your
last
five
minutes
questioning
so
you
may
have
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
find
what
lying
on
the
ground?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
why
he
could
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
we're
entitled
to
infer
when
he
said
they
were
not
released
to
us
if
they
were
refused.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
needle
before
you
leave
that,
again,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
with
mr.
forer,
do
these
proceedings
that
we
have
just
been
talking
about
indicate
any
sex
background
for
this
girl.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
asked
you,
i
assume
by
this
time
you
and
the
state
must
know
what
those
probation
papers
disclosed.
now,
i
ask
you
if
those
that
petition
that
was
before
the
montgomery
court
the
juvenile
court
as
the
time
the
counsel
asked
to
see
it
have
shown
that
this
girl
had
had
a
background
of
sex.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
how
can
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
she
was
sexually
promiscuous
but
she
was
--
it
was
stated,
i
understand
this
record
that
she
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
juvenile
delinquent
because
she
was
not
amenable
to
parental
discipline.
and
that
therefore
she
should
be
placed
on
probation.
now,
was
that
--
was
the
conduct
on
her
part
was
complained
out
there
sexual
looseness
or
what
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
the
record
because
i
know
they
couldn't
get
it
in
there
and
i'm
asking
you
and
certainly
you
must
know
the
state
must
know
by
this
time
what
was
in
that
petition
and
what
was
in
those
proceedings.
now
i'm
going
to
ask
you
if
it
did
have
a
sexual
background.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
all
what
was
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
the
record
is
what
was,
what
you
stipulated
was
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
record
itself
show?
anything
in
addition
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
in
the
juvenile
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
before
--
before
this
rape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
stay
right
with
that
petition
for
a
moment.
what
did
that
show?
did
it
show
only
what
you
have
just
said
or
did
it
show
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
not
talk
about
the
testimony.
what
did
the
petition
show?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
for
what
reason?
what
was
her
conduct
that
showed
that?
i
suppose
your
--
your
petition
shows
some
misconduct
on
her
part.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
asking
you
what
it
shows
and
certainly
the
state
must
know
by
this
time
what
that
petition
showed.
don't
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
saying
now
that
the
state
does
not
know
that
this
time
what
was
in
that
petition
other
than
as
you
get
it
from
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
that's
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
answer
is
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
conversation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
claim
--
what
did
they
claim
for
the
both
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
to
stop
the
man
and
use
epithets
on
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
out
in
the
woods?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
i
said
it
before
you,
take
your
chair.
i
want
to
broaden
now
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
you
a
little
bit,
suppose
that
the
state
knew
and
the
prosecution
i
mean
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
these
petitioners
what
the
state
now
knows
and
what
we
now
know
from
this
record
would
the
prosecution
have
been
obliged
to
divulge
to
the
defense
any
of
those
matters
concerning
the
prior
conduct
of
this
girl
for
after
the
rape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
been
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
borrowing
your
rules
of
evidence
and
considering
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
men
had
a
fair
trial
and
in
that
were
entitled
to
take
all
signs
and
circumstance
of
the
record
into
our
consideration.
would
you
say
that
if
the
state
then
knew
what
you
now
knew
and
in
order
to
have
a
fair
trial
they
should
have
the
divulged
that
information
to
the
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
--
let's
put
it
this
way
then,
the
--
let's
go
to
the
sentencing
process.
if
they
had
that
information
is
it
not
likely
that
the
judge
would
have
taken
that
information
into
consideration
in
sentencing
these
men
and
that
in
doing
so,
he
would
have
expired
some
other
sentence
other
than
death
even
down
to
i
think
you
said
that
minimum
was
18
months
or
something
like
that
18
months
to
death
might
be
not
then
of
even
some
other
sentence
than
that
if
that
had
disclosed
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
make
it
moot
because
the
judge
might
have
given
him
20
years,
might
have
given
him
15,
or
might
have
given
him
10
might
have
given
him
18
months.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
so
you
can't
say
that's
moot
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
wave
everything
but
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
here?
they
didn't
waive
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
they're
not
--
the
gravamen
of
their
charge
is
not
that
it's
admissible
that
could
be
thought
out
by
different
manner
but
the
gravamen
of
their
complaint
is
that
this
information
was
in
the
hands
of
the
state
and
they
did
not
divulge
it.
and
whether
it's
on
the
trial
i
would
say
that
whether
it's
on
the
sentence
if
it
is
just
improper
that
that
should
have
--
information
should
have
been
given
to
them
it
should
have
been
given
to
them
if
not
for
the
trial
certain
report
for
the
sentencing
process
which
was
later.
chief
justice
earl
warren
useful
well
by
of
course
it
have
been
useful.
i
think
we
all
agree
on
that.
but
was
a
responsibility
on
them
to
give
it
to
the
defense,
that
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
known
what
we
all
know
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
based
on
what
knew
now
should
not
this
case
be
sent
back
at
least
for
the
sentencing
process
where
those
things
can
be
considered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suggest
that
you
send
both
to
us
if
you
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
want
to
ask
you
of
course
you,
you
said
that
your
defendant
that
if
we
knew
--
if
you
knew
then
what
we
know
now
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
order
to
assure
fair
trial
they
should
have
disclosed
the
information.
now,
and
then
i
ask
you
if
the
fact
that
we
do
know
it
now
in
considering
this
matter
do
you
object
to
sending
it
back
to
have
these
matters
disclosed
to
counsel
and
to
the
court
we're
hearing
on
the
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
what
your
position
is
but
if
you
do
know
now
that
in
order
to
accord
a
man
a
fair
trial
he
should
have
had
certain
information.
he
and
the
judge
have
had
certain
information
which
the
prosecution
have
but
didn't
disclose
shouldn't
he
now
be
able
to
have
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
has
to
serve
the
rest
of
his
life
in
jail
or
whether
he
might
receive
some
clemency
of
some
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
trial
court
decided
against
you
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let's
agree
here
decisive
to
decide
it
too.
now
mr.
may
i
just
ask
one
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
record
shows
that
the
trial
judge
did
or
did
not
have
this
information
about
the
probation
matters.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
you
can
point
to
show
that
the
judge
did
or
did
not
have
this
evidence
concerning
what
occurred
in
this
probation
proceedings.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
gather
that
impression
myself
because
i
have
been
reading
from
pages
156
and
157
and
the
judge
said
there
that
“of”
course
the
jury
didn't
believe
you,
the
jury
rightly
didn't
believe
you,
what
i
have
said
to
your
brother
and
codefendant
in
this
case
applies
to
you
and
that
is
the
fact
that
nothing
had
been
shown
in
extenuation.
and
i
would
assume
that
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
ask
your
counsel
if
you
need
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
was
such
a
report
in
this
case
would
you
include
that
please
with
the
probation
officer's
report
that
you're
going
to
send.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy,
the
time
has
expired
but
we've
taken
so
much
of
the
time,
i'm
going
to
give
you
10
minutes
to
conclude
your
argument
if
you
will
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
way
under
maryland
law
where
he
can
now
do
--
these
petitions
can
do
anything
that
so
far
as
this
newly
discovered
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
i
just
begging
your
co-counsel
has
said
that
this
wasn't
admissible
because
of
maryland
law.
you
now
say
that
they
can
use
the
newly
discovered
evidence
in
other
ways.
is
there
any
other
way
than
the
one
they
have
chosen
here
under
maryland
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
was
that
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
james

what
was
that
last
you
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
maryland.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question,
is
there
any
in
that
original
petition
for
make
a
reward
of
their
sex
background
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
being
beyond
parental
control?
chief
justice
earl
warren
kardy
was
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
kardy
was
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer,
did
i
understand
you
did
say
that
at
the
trial,
she
testified
that
she
was
the
first

to
speak
of

chief

mr.

before

do

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
you
told
has
been

that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
give
your
last
five
minutes
questioning
so
you
may
have
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
find
what
lying
on

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
why
he
could
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
we're
entitled
to
infer
when
he
said
they
were
not
released
to
us
if
they
were
refused.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
needle
before
you
leave
that,
again,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
with
mr.
forer,
do
these
proceedings
that
we
have
just
been
talking
about
indicate
any
sex
background
for
this
girl.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
asked
you,
i
assume
by
this
time
you
and
the
state
must
know
what
those
probation
papers
disclosed.
now,
i
ask
you
if
those
that
petition
that
was
before
the
montgomery
court
the
juvenile
court
as
the
time
the
counsel
asked
to
see
it
have
shown
that
this
girl
had
had
a
background
of
sex.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
how
can
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
she
was
sexually
promiscuous
but
she
was
--
it
was
stated,
i
understand
this
record
that
she
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
juvenile
delinquent
because
she
was
not
amenable
to
parental
discipline.
and
that
therefore
she
should
be
placed
on
probation.
now,
was
that
--
was
the
conduct
on
her
part
was
complained
out
there
sexual
looseness
or
what
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
the
record
because
i
know
they
couldn't
get
it
in
there
and
i'm
asking
you
and
certainly
you
must
know
the
state
must
know
by
this
time
what
was
in
that
petition
and
what
was
in
those
proceedings.
now
i'm
going
to
ask
you
if
it
did
have
a
sexual
background.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
all
what
was
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
the
record
is
what
was,
what
you
stipulated
was
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
record
itself
show?
anything
in
addition
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
in
the
juvenile
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
before
--
before
this
rape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
stay
right
with
that
petition
for
a
moment.
what
did
that
show?
did
it
show
only
what
you
have
just
said
or
did
it
show
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
not
talk
about
the
testimony.
what
did
the
petition
show?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
for
what
reason?
what
was
her
conduct
that
showed
that?
i
suppose
your
--
your
petition
shows
some
misconduct
on
her
part.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
asking
you
what
it
shows
and
certainly
the
state
must
know
by
this
time
what
that
petition
showed.
don't
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
saying
now
that
the
state
does
not
know
that
this
time
what
was
in
that
petition
other
than
as
you
get
it
from
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
that's
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
answer
is
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
conversation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
claim
--
what
did
they
claim
for
the
both
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
to
stop
the
man
and
use
epithets
on
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
out
in
the
woods?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
i
said
it
before
you,
take
your
chair.
i
want
to
broaden
now
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
you
a
little
bit,
suppose
that
the
state
knew
and
the
prosecution
i
mean
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
these
petitioners
what
the
state
now
knows
and
what
we
now
know
from
this
record
would
the
prosecution
have
been
obliged
to
divulge
to
the
defense
any
of
those
matters
concerning
the
prior
conduct
of
this
girl
for
after
the
rape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
been
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
borrowing
your
rules
of
evidence
and
considering
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
men
had
a
fair
trial
and
in
that
were
entitled
to
take
all
signs
and
circumstance
of
the
record
into
our
consideration.
would
you
say
that
if
the
state
then
knew
what
you
now
knew
and
in
order
to
have
a
fair
trial
they
should
have
the
divulged
that
information
to
the
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
--
let's
put
it
this
way
then,
the
--
let's
go
to
the
sentencing
process.
if
they
had
that
information
is
it
not
likely
that
the
judge
would
have
taken
that
information
into
consideration
in
sentencing
these
men
and
that
in
doing
so,
he
would
have
expired
some
other
sentence
other
than
death
even
down
to
i
think
you
said
that
minimum
was
18
months
or
something
like
that
18
months
to
death
might
be
not
then
of
even
some
other
sentence
than
that
if
that
had
disclosed
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
make
it
moot
because
the
judge
might
have
given
him
20
years,
might
have
given
him
15,
or
might
have
given
him
10
might
have
given
him
18
months.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
so
you
can't
say
that's
moot
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
wave
everything
but
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
here?
they
didn't
waive
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
they're
not
--
the
gravamen
of
their
charge
is
not
that
it's
admissible
that
could
be
thought
out
by
different
manner
but
the
gravamen
of
their
complaint
is
that
this
information
was
in
the
hands
of
the
state
and
they
did
not
divulge
it.
and
whether
it's
on
the
trial
i
would
say
that
whether
it's
on
the
sentence
if
it
is
just
improper
that
that
should
have
--
information
should
have
been
given
to
them
it
should
have
been
given
to
them
if
not
for
the
trial
certain
report
for
the
sentencing
process
which
was
later.
chief
justice
earl
warren
useful
well
by
of
course
it
have
been
useful.
i
think
we
all
agree
on
that.
but
was
a
responsibility
on
them
to
give
it
to
the
defense,
that
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
known
what
we
all
know
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
based
on
what
knew
now
should
not
this
case
be
sent
back
at
least
for
the
sentencing
process
where
those
things
can
be
considered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suggest
that
you
send
both
to
us
if
you
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
want
to
ask
you
of
course
you,
you
said
that
your
defendant
that
if
we
knew
--
if
you
knew
then
what
we
know
now
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
order
to
assure
fair
trial
they
should
have
disclosed
the
information.
now,
and
then
i
ask
you
if
the
fact
that
we
do
know
it
now
in
considering
this
matter
do
you
object
to
sending
it
back
to
have
these
matters
disclosed
to
counsel
and
to
the
court
we're
hearing
on
the
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
what
your
position
is
but
if
you
do
know
now
that
in
order
to
accord
a
man
a
fair
trial
he
should
have
had
certain
information.
he
and
the
judge
have
had
certain
information
which
the
prosecution
have
but
didn't
disclose
shouldn't
he
now
be
able
to
have
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
has
to
serve
the
rest
of
his
life
in
jail
or
whether
he
might
receive
some
clemency
of
some
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
trial
court
decided
against
you
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let's
agree
here
decisive
to
decide
it
too.
now
mr.
may
i
just
ask
one
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
record
shows
that
the
trial
judge
did
or
did
not
have
this
information
about
the
probation
matters.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
you
can
point
to
show
that
the
judge
did
or
did
not
have
this
evidence
concerning
what
occurred
in
this
probation
proceedings.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
gather
that
impression
myself
because
i
have
been
reading
from
pages
156
and
157
and
the
judge
said
there
that
“of”
course
the
jury
didn't
believe
you,
the
jury
rightly
didn't
believe
you,
what
i
have
said
to
your
brother
and
codefendant
in
this
case
applies
to
you
and
that
is
the
fact
that
nothing
had
been
shown
in
extenuation.
and
i
would
assume
that
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
ask
your
counsel
if
you
need
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
was
such
a
report
in
this
case
would
you
include
that
please
with
the
probation
officer's
report
that
you're
going
to
send.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy,
the
time
has
expired
but
we've
taken
so
much
of
the
time,
i'm
going
to
give
you
10
minutes
to
conclude
your
argument
if
you
will
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
way
under
maryland
law
where
he
can
now
do
--
these
petitions
can
do
anything
that
so
far
as
this
newly
discovered
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
i
just
begging
your
co-counsel
has
said
that
this
wasn't
admissible
because
of
maryland
law.
you
now
say
that
they
can
use
the
newly
discovered
evidence
in
other
ways.
is
there
any
other
way
than
the
one
they
have
chosen
here
under
maryland
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
was
that
you
say?
