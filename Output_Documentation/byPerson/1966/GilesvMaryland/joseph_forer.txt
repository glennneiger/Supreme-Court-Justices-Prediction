mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
as
a
proceeding
under
the
maryland
post-conviction
procedure
act
which
is
a
statutory
substitute
for
habeas
corpus
and
coram
nobis.
the
petitioners
who
were
serving
life
sentences
and
are
serving
life
sentences
following
the
commutation
of
death
sentences
challenged
their
conviction
for
rape
under
the
act
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
first
question
that
i
will
argue
is
whether
the
conviction
of
the
petitioners
was
obtained
in
violation
of
due
process
by
reason
of
the
prosecution
suppression
of
material
evidence
favorable
to
the
accused.
and
for
that
purpose,
i
must
first
give
you
a
condensed
summary
of
the
evidence
which
came
out
at
the
petitioner's
criminal
trial.
the
petitioners
are
brothers.
on
the
night
of
july
20,
1961,
they
were
swimming
and
fishing
in
the
patuxent
river
near
their
home.
as
they
left
the
river
with
the
companion
joseph
johnson,
they
encountered
500
feet
from
the
river
in
deep
woods
an
automobile.
in
that
automobile
were
two
people,
a
16-year
old
girl
named
joyce,
and
a
21-year
old
man
stewart
foster.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
was
late
at
night
close
to
midnight.
an
altercation
started
at
the
car
between
the
giles
brothers
and
johnson
on
the
one
hand
and
stewart
foster
on
the
other.
the
testimony
is
in
conflict
as
to
what
caused
the
altercation
and
who
provoked
it
and
for
present
purposes,
i'd
not
go
into
that.
but
very
early
in
the
altercation,
at
the
time
when
james
giles
and
johnson
threw
some
stones
at
the
car,
joyce
ran
out
of
the
car
and
into
the
woods
along
the
side
of
the
dark
road.
according
to
her
testimony,
she
ran
a
distance
of
30
feet
at
which
point
she
stopped
because
she
said
she
was
out
of
breathe
and
she
had
fallen.
john
giles
soon
afterwards
left
the
car
while
the
altercation
was
still
going
on
to
come
back
into
the
woods
and
came
upon
joyce.
the
two
of
them
were
together
there
for
approximately
10
or
15
minutes
during
which
time
they
had
some
conversation.
joyce
herself
testified
that
she
was
the
first
person
to
introduce
the
subject
of
sex.
in
that
she
offered
john
giles
to
have
intercourse
with
him
if
he
would
help
her
get
away.
john
giles
also
testified
to
that
offer.
but
he
gave
it
a
little
more
body,
he
testified
that
she
also
explained
to
him
that
she
was
on
probation
and
couldn't
afford
to
get
caught
in
the
woods
and
didn't
want
to
get
in
any
trouble
and
for
that
reason
she
was
anxious
that
he
help
her
get
away.
after
they
have
been
quietly
in
the
woods
together
for
a
while.
the
altercation
of
the
car
ended
when
stewart
foster
was
knocked
out
and
then
ran
off.
the
other
two
young
negroes,
joseph
johnson
and
james
giles,
came
into
the
woods
along
the
same
path
and
they
came
upon
john
giles
and
joyce.
at
this
point,
there's
a
very
serious
cleavage
in
the
testimony.
joyce
testified
that
the
three
men
were
there
and
that
each
one
of
the
three
they're
after
having
intercourse
with
her.
she
testified
that
she
did
not
resist,
she
testified
that
she
made
no
outcry,
she
also
testified
that
she
made
no
remonstrance.
she
didn't
even
say
to
them,
“please
let
me
alone.”
she
also
took
off
her
own
clothes.
this
was
her
own
testimony.
she
said
she
submitted
this
way
because
she
was
frightened.
the
giles
brothers
testified
that
as
the
two
who
had
been
delayed
came
along
the
path,
joyce
called
them
over
saying
to
john,
“well
i
know
what
you
boys
want.”
then
she
called
them
over
and
said,
“i
know
what
you
boys
like”
and
then
urged
them
to
have
intercourse
with
her.
she
took
off
her
own
clothes,
she
was
the
stage
master
of
the
affair.
she
directed
the
order
of
intercourse.
and
then
the
course
of
this
transaction,
she
told
them
that
she
had
had
16
or
17
other
boys
that
week
and
two
or
three
more
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
she
told
james
giles
that
she
was
in
trouble,
and
that
if
she
were
caught
in
the
woods,
she
would
have
to
claim
that
she
was
raped.
she
repeated
to
john
giles
that
she
was
on
probation
and
that
if
she
were
caught
in
the
woods,
she
said
she
would
have
to
claim
she
was
raped.
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
giles
brothers,
john
giles
refused
the
invitation
of
the
intercourse,
the
other
two
accepted
the
intercourse.
at
the
trial,
on
redirect
examination
by
the
state,
joyce
was
asked
if
she
was
in
fact
on
probation
at
the
time
of
this
episode.
she
denied
that
she
was
on
probation
and
thereafter
on
cross
examination
of
the
petitioners,
the
state
very
effectively
ridiculed
their
testimony
that
she
had
told
them
that
she
was
on
probation.
at
the
trial,
the
giles
brothers
being
indigent
or
represented
by
court
appointed
counsel.
joseph
johnson,
the
third
man
in
the
affair
was
also
indicted
but
he
got
his
case
severed
and
transferred
at
orlando
county
and
he's
not
in
this
case
although
it's
an
open
secret
that
his
faith
abides
this
case.
the
trial
started
on
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
said
it's
an
open
secret
that
his
faith
abides
the
result
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
has
been
tried,
convicted,
sentenced
to
death
commuted.
post
conviction
petition
filed
and
by
agreement
with
the
state
every
batch
has
been
held
up
to
see
what
happens
here.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
got
a
severance
and
a
change
of
venue.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
no,
this
happened
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
patuxent
river
is
the
border
line
between
montgomery
and
howard
and
they
were
on
the
montgomery
county
side.
now,
the
trial
started
one
day
december
4
and
it
ended
the
next
that's
from
the
choosing
of
a
jury
for
the
jury
verdict
of
guilty.
the
only
defense
witnesses
for
the
petitioners
with
the
technical
and
academic
exception
that
the
defense
counsel
also
called
two
of
the
policemen
and
they
tried
unsuccessfully
to
get
them
to
admit
that
joyce
had
originally
told
the
police
that
she
was
even
raped
by
two
men
rather
than
by
three.
they
denied
it
and
the
only
listed
to
help
defense,
the
whole
thing
was
a
factless
maneuver
because
joyce
had
already
admitted
that
she
had
originally
told
that
to
the
police.
the
case
went
to
the
jury.
it
was
a
conflict
between
credibility.
this
all
white
jury
had
to
decide
whether
to
believe
this
16-year
old
white
girl
or
these
two
young
negroes.
and
the
story
that
these
two
young
negroes
gave
was
the
most
implausible
story.
it
was
that
under
these
rather
frightening
conditions,
the
16-year
old
child
solicited
intercourse
with
three
negro
strangers.
for
the
jury
to
believe
their
story,
they
would
have
to
find
that
this
16-year
old
child
was
incredibly
wanted
that
she
was
probably
mentally
disturbed
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
either
condition.
they
would
also
have
to
believe
that
this
girl
who
was
not
on
probation
went
around
intuitively
telling
people
that
she
was
on
probation.
the
jury
found
them
guilty
and
their
story
didn't
impress
the
trial
judge,
judge
pugh,
very
much
either
because
although
under
maryland
law,
he
had
a
choice
of
sentence
from
18
months
they
day
he
imposed
to
that
sentence.
these
two
brothers
were
at
that
time
aged
20
and
22.
joseph
johnson
didn't
feel
any
better
in
this
trial
at
minneapolis.
after
the
appeals
were
exhausted
on
november
16,
1962,
11
months
after
the
verdict,
a
new
trial
motion
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
alleging
the
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
circuit
court
denied
this
motion
without
even
looking
at
the
newly
discovered
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
motion
was
filed
too
late.
they
said
under
maryland
rules
if
you
want
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
base
of
newly
discovered
evidence
you
have
to
file
within
three
days
after
verdict.
this
ruling
was
affirmed
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
subsequently,
in
october
of
1963,
governor
tawes
commuted
the
death
sentences
of
the
three
men,
that
is,
for
two
petitioners
and
johnson
to
life.
this
post
conviction
proceeding
was
filed
about
six
months
after
that
in
may
of
1964.
it
was
heard
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
though
before
a
different
judge
than
the
sentencing
judge.
and
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
circuit
court
found
that
the
petitioners
had
been
denied
due
process
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
had
suppressed
material
exculpatory
evidence.
the
state
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
--
the
court
of
appeals
heard
the
case
en
banc
and
they
reversed
five
to
two.
and
that
then
we
came
here.
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
evidence
which
came
out
at
the
post
conviction
trial
and
a
description
of
the
evidence
that
we
claim
was
suppressed,
i
would
like
to
mention
a
couple
of
the
legal
issues
that
are
involved.
the
legal
issues
in
the
suppression
point
all
arise
out
of
one
sentence.
they
all
arise
within
the
framework
of
one
sentence
over
the
court's
decision,
1963
decision
in
brady
against
maryland.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“we
now
hold
that
the
suppression
by
the
prosecution
of
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
upon
request
violates
due
process
where
the
evidence
is
material
either
to
guilt
or
to
punishment
irrespective
of
the
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
the
prosecution.”
now,
in
that
case,
the
qualification
of
on
request
is
explainable
by
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
the
evidence
which
had
been
withheld
had
been
requested.
in
fact,
none
of
the
lower
courts
which
have
passed
on
suppression
cases
have
ever
made
a
requirement
that
the
defense
had
to
request
the
information
before
the
nondisclosure
could
be
excused.
and
this
is
true
of
cases
which
were
decided
before
brady
including
two
third
circuit
cases
which
brady
cited
with
approval
of
stating
the
correct
rule
and
two
of
cases
cited
after
brady
and
it
was
true
in
this
very
case.
in
this
very
case,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
did
not
require
a
showing
of
a
request
for
disclosure
and
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
--
if
you
--
a
requirement
of
a
request
would
defeat
the
rule
because
the
time
when
a
defense
needs
disclosure
the
most,
is
when
the
defense
is
so
ignorant
and
so
uninformed
that
it
doesn't
know
what
to
request
or
even
whether
to
request.
so
for
the
future
purposes,
i
shall
assume
that
the
brady
rule
applies
without
the
need
for
a
request
for
the
exposure
abiding
the
facts.
that
brings
me
to
the
second
requirement
of
the
brady
case
and
that
is
that
the
withheld
evidence
be
material.
and
brady
didn't
explain
the
meaning
of
the
test
of
materiality.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
didn't
explain
it
either
but
if
you
analyze
what
they
did,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
held
that
evidence
is
immaterial
unless
it
were
so
strong
that
as
to
be
full
through.
if
there
was
any
possibility
that
it
might
not
have
affected
the
result
then
it
wasn't
material.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
analogy
here
should
be
to
the
test
of
materiality
which
this
court
develop
in
cases
like
the
napue
case
where
the
fault
was
the
introduction
of
testimony
known
to
the
prosecution
to
be
incorrect
and
the
failure
of
the
prosecution
to
correct
the
incorrect
testimony.
and
the
tests
stated
by
this
court
in
the
napue
case
was
that
the
evidence,
the
wrongful
--
the
admitted
evidence,
was
material
and
tainted
the
conviction
if
the
false
testimony,
“may
have
had
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial”
and
the
court
has
applied
the
same
tests
to
cases
where
evidence
where
illegally
obtained
evidence
and
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
admitted.
so
in
they
against
connecticut,
the
test
was
whether
the
admission
of
the
evidence
--
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
admission
of
the
evidence
might
have
affected
the
result.
now,
this
kind
of
case
is
a
corollary
case
to
the
use
of
false
evidence
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
same
test
of
materiality
should
apply
namely
if
the
evidence
if
the
evidence
have
been
revealed,
was
there
a
reasonable
possibility
that
it
would
have
affected
the
result.
in
our
view,
this
test
of
materiality
was
more
than
that.
and
now
i
come
to
our
description
of
the
evidence
that
we
claim
was
suppressed
and
which
was
brought
out
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding.
the
evidence
falls
under
two
categories.
the
first
category
is
evidence
of
the
events
between
the
episode
the
alleged
rape
of
july
20,
1961
and
the
trial
in
december
1961.
the
evidence
shows
this,
on
the
9th
of
august
26,
1961,
one
month
after
the
alleged
rape,
three
months
before
the
trial,
joyce
went
to
a
party,
and
at
the
party
she
had
intercourse
with
two
men;
one
in
the
bathroom,
one
in
the
yard.
early
the
next
morning,
she
took
an
overdose
of
drugs
and
a
suicide
attempt
and
she
was
taken
to
a
hospital
and
was
kept
in
the
hospital
in
the
psychiatric
ward
of
the
hospital
for
10
days
with
admitting
diagnosis
of
a
psychopathic
personality.
while
she
was
in
the
psychopathic
ward
of
the
hospital
she
was
visited
by
a
boyfriend
of
hers
named
busty.
busty
asked
her
why
did
she
attempt
suicide.
she
told
busty
that
she
had
been
raped
the
night
before
the
suicide
attempt
by
these
two
men
that
whom
she
had
had
intercourse
at
the
park,
and
she
gave
him
the
names
of
the
men
and
all
the
detail.
busty
reported
this
rather
officiously
because
she
didn't
ask
him
though.
busty
reported
this
to
her
parents.
her
mother
first
called
sergeant
way
up
in
montgomery
county
police
who
was
in-charged
of
the
investigation
resulting
in
the
conviction
of
petitioners.
and
she
told
sergeant
whalen
that
joyce
had
been
raped
again.
so
whalen
asked
her
where
did
this
take
place
and
she
said
in
prince
george's
county.
so
whalen
said
well
don't
bother
me,
tell
it
to
the
prince
george's
county
police
and
presumably
he
went
back
to
sleep.
so
she
or
her
husband
reported
it
to
the
prince
george's
county
police.
detective
sergeant
wheeler
of
the
prince
george's
county
police
came
to
the
hospital
to
interview
joyce
in
connection
with
this
complaint.
when
he
interviewed
her,
the
first
thing
she
told
them
was
that
these
two
men
at
the
party
had
had
relations
with
her
against
her
will.
but
he
then
questioned
her
further.
in
the
course
of
the
questioning
it
became
perfectly
apparent
that
she
had
not
been
raped,
that
she
engaged
in
voluntary
intercourse,
she
had
put
up
no
resistance
and
that
the
most
she
had
was
an
unexpressed
mental
reservation.
she
really
didn't
want
to
engage
an
intercourse
with
these
two
boys
at
that
time.
she
said
at
that
particular
time
because
she
was
afraid
that
if
all
the
other
boys
at
the
party
got
to
know
about
it,
they
would
all
insist
on
having
intercourse
with
her.
otherwise,
she
said
she
wouldn't
even
have
had
this
mental;
reservation,
and
she
also
admitted
that
in
the
past
with
one
of
the
two
men
with
whom
she
have
had
intercourse
at
the
party,
she
had
had
relation
with.
they
were
white.
which
boy?
you
mean
the
second
rape
claim?
mr.
joseph
forer
they
were
white,
they
were
white
mr.
joseph
forer
one
month
after
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
one
month
after
the
alleged
rape
by
petitioners
three
months
before
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
the
first,
this
is
what
then
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
in
a
few
--
if
i
may
hold
it
until
i
finish
my
account
of
the
evidence
because
i
haven't
concluded
it
i
will
come
to
that
question
justice
black.
she
also
told
wheeler
a
little
more
than
these
circumstances,
she
also
told
wheeler
something
about
her
sex
history
generally.
he
told
him
that
for
the
past
two
years
since
the
time
she
was
14,
she
had
had
intercourse
relations
with
so
many
different
man
and
boys
that
she
didn't
know
how
many
including
many
of
them
who
were
strangers.
joseph
told
them
that
on
numerous
occasions
she
had
engaged
in
oral
settlement.
at
this
point
wheeler
marked
the
case
closed
on
count.
now,
to
get
to
justice
black's
question,
these
episodes
and
these
are
episodes
within
the
first
category
for
purposes
of
the
precedence
and
the
evidentiary
question.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
narrative
account
to
have
four
components.
first
is
that
she
made
a
false
accusation
of
rape
against
somebody
else.
secondly
that
she
attempted
suicide
and
incidentally
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding
and
psychiatrist
testified
that
this
of
the
16-year
old
girl
was
itself
indicative
a
serious
mental
disturbance.
third,
she
was
hospitalized
in
the
psychiatric
ward
and,
fourth
that
she
had
a
sex
history
indicative
of
nymphomania.
now,
the
authorities
numerous
authority
dealing
with
sex
cases
in
various
jurisdictions
hold
even
in
the
abstract
that
any
as
to
each
one
of
these
four
components
that
they
are
admissible
in
evidence
where
there
is
a
defense
of
consent
because
they
are
indicative
of
the
mental
illness
of
the
prosecutor
and
because
they
are
indicative
of
a
well-known
syndrome
which
involves
as
a
characteristic
element,
a
compulsion
on
the
part
of
a
young
girl
to
contrive
sex
offenses
by
men.
mr.
joseph
forer
in
the
law
of
maryland,
nothing
gets
clear
on
the
evidence.
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
majority
said
we
will
assume
that
this
information
could
reasonably
have
been
deemed
admissible
and
useful.
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
case
law
of
maryland
isn't
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
just
not
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
however,
this
--
on
the
one
hand
the
majority
--
at
least
the
court
that
sets
the
law
in
maryland.
majority
said
we're
willing
to
assume
it
would
have
been
admissible.
the
two
judges
in
the
minority
said
we
think
that
it
was
reasonably
admissible
or
a
reasonable
possibility
of
admissibility
and
pointed
out
that
when
you
come
to
the
close
question
with
evidence,
you
can't
tell
whether
it's
admissible
until
you
see
how
it's
produced
when
she
seems
to
me
make
the
most
sense.
the
grounds
on
which
is
often
a
particular
way
the
counsel
works
within
and
so
forth.
and
the
trial
judge
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
also
said
that
he
thought
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
admissibility
and
he
also
said,
he
doesn't
have
to
find
the
least
admissible
in
case
there
were
a
trial.
in
another
ground
of
materiality
here,
is
that
with
this
kind
of
information,
it
seems
to
us
that
defense
could
have
applied
for
and
would
have
received
a
pretrial
mental
examination
of
the
prosecutor.
and
considering
the
evidence
which
we
do
not
claim
to
be
suppressed
but
the
newly
discovered
evidence
in
addition
to
what
i
have
described,
there
is
certainly
a
very
strong
possibility
that
this
mental
examination
would
have
been
adverse
to
the
girl's
credibility.
if
i
may
anticipate
the
next
question,
there
is
no
law
in
maryland
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
or
not
pretrial
mental
examinations
can
be
ordered
in
such
a
situation.
now,
aside
from
the
fact--
mr.
joseph
forer
there
is
law
elsewhere
and
decided
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
there
is
law--
mr.
joseph
forer
if
you
will
look
at
page
31
of
my
--
our
brief
justice
stewart
you
will
see
that
we
cite
some
law
on
that
subject.
we
cited
the
new
jersey
case,
california
case
and
the
south
dakota
case.
and
we
also
explained
what
sanctions
are
available
to
the
court
if
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
take
the
--
such
a
mental
examination.
this
is
the
new
law
and
as
i
say
there
is
no
precedent
in
one
way
or
the
other
in
new
jersey.
but
leaving
aside,
the
question
of
whether
in
maryland
--
mr.
joseph
forer
in
maryland.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
states
should
have
informed
the
defense
of
it.
and
then
by
the
state
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
not
only
an
escapade
that
she
had
made
a
false
accusation
of
rape
against
somebody
else
when
part
of
their
defense
was
that
she
was
making
a
false
accusation
of
rape
against
them.
and
when
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
as
i
narrated,
she
told
her
boyfriend
busty
who
told
her
family,
who
told
the
police,
but
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
when
sergeant
wheeler
talked
to
her,
the
first
thing
that
she
said
to
wheeler,
the
very
first
thing
amounted
to
an
accusation
of
rape
because
she
said
to
wheeler,
these
two
men
had
intercourse
with
me
against
my
will.
it
was
then
when
wheeler
cross-examined
her
that
these
facts
came
out.
she
never
denied
that
she'd
been
raped,
she
just
gave
them
the
facts
which
negatives
is
rape.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
that's
right,
then
no
wonder.
now,
leaving
aside
the
abstract
question
that
this
kind
of
evidence
in
segments
of
it
has
been
held
admissible
in
various
jurisdiction.
this
evidence
has
peculiar
materiality
and
peculiar
relevancy
here
so
that
in
my
view
it
could
have
been
admitted
because
of
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
regardless
of
some
other
technical
obstacle.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
it
well
may
have
been
because
if
they
want
--
mr.
joseph
forer
actually
justice
black,
we
don't
think
you
have
to
go
that
far.
but
to
answer
your
hypothetical
question
because
i
don't
think
that's
involved
here
--
now
it
is
--because
if
the
evidence
would
have
been
admissible
you
don't
have
to
decide
whether
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
if
it's
not
admissible.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
on
the
basis
of
state
law.
now,
if
i
will
go
further,
however,
if
all
these
evidence
were
inadmissible
in
state
law
in
my
opinion,
that
would
be
just
as
much
a
violation
of
due
process
as
it
is
to
convict
the
person
on
the
state
law
without
any
evidence
of
guilt.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
as
far
as
i
go.
if
i
may
say--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
that's
not
correct
either,
it
might
be
because
if
you
--
first,
you
never
can
tell
really
whether
the
evidence
is
admissible
or
not,
but
secondly,
this
may
be
evidence
which
will
lead
them
to
evidence
which
they
can
produce
in
an
admissible
form.
so
the
question
really
isn't
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
now,
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
to
make
the
judgment,
whether
evidence
that
he
has
is
reasonably
exculpatory
and
material
and
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
other
side
might
not
have.
and
the
court
of
maryland,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
held
this
state
law
as
well
as
federal
law
held
that
where
there
is
a
possibility,
a
reasonable
possibility
of
materiality
and
admissibility,
the
prosecutor
has
a
duty
to
inform
either
the
defense
or
the
judge
or
the
jury
of
this
exculpatory
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
just
said
that's
the
law.
they
--
now,
whether
they
were
interpreting
state
law
or
federal
law
and
--
but
i
will
say
that
this
principle
has
been
announced
not
only
by
the
state
of
maryland
but
by
federal
circuits
including
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
griffin
case
which
was
cited
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
that's
certainly
a
law
in
maryland.
but
the
peculiar
relevancy
of
this
testimony
is
that
it
would
have
made
plausible
the
testimony
of
the
petitioners
that
was
otherwise
unbelievable.
it
would
have
made
plausible
that
that
testimony
which
required
the
jury
to
believe
that
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
that
would
have
acted
and
spoken
that
way
that
in
other
words,
she
was
not
just
an
ordinary
child,
but
she
was
the
kind
of
child
that
lillian
helman
wrote
her
famous
play
about.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
coming
to
that
as
my
next
subject
and
if
you
will
just
defer
it,
because
i
would
now
like
to
go
into
my
second
category.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
which
was
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
now,
furthermore
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
prosecution,
i
meant
to
say
that
to
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
forer
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
with
the
information,
the
knowledge
was
--
and
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
the
chief
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
who
was
the
chief
prosecutor
would
personally
drive
the
case.
he
had
the
same
knowledge
incidentally
that
the
--
that
lieutenant
whalen
who
was
the
chief
detective
in-charged
of
the
investigation
then.
so
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
we
have
any
problem
as
to
who
is
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
if
he
were
just
told
that,
i
will
come
to
the
knowledge
aspect
in
just
a
moment
but
i
want
to
correct
one
--
i
want
to
follow
up
one
other
thing.
this
information
wasn't
admissible
merely
to
impeach
joyce's
credibility.
in
my
opinion,
it
was
also
preoperative
a
substantive
evidence
of
their
testimony
that
she
had
said
to
them
in
the
woods,
“i
have
16
or
17
other
boys
this
week
and
two
or
three
more
won't
make
any
difference.”
does
this
testimony
a,
makes
it
entirely
plausible
that
she
did
have
16
or
17
other
boys
that
week
and
b
that
whether
or
not
she
had
it,
she
would
go
around
and
tell
it
to
relative
strangers.
so
it
would
have
corroborated
that.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
second
category
then
i'll
get
to
the
question
of
knowledge
but
i
would
like
to
clean
out
what
the
evidence
that
we're
complaining
about
the
--
you
recall
that
i
said
that
the
petitioners
testified
that
joyce
have
told
them
variously
that
she
was
on
probation
or
in
trouble
and
that
if
she
were
caught
in
the
woods
because
of
this
thing
on
probation
or
in
trouble
she
would
have
to
claim
that
she
was
raped.
now,
there
was
no
corroboration
of
this
testimony
and
the
petitioner's
testimony
to
this
effect
was
ridiculed
by
the
state
and
joyce
denied
that
she
was
on
probation.
now,
as
the
post-conviction
proceeding
showed
at
the
time
of
this
episode
in
the
woods
that
was
pending
against
joyce
a
petition
in
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
alleging
that
she
was
beyond
parental
console
and
a
recommendation
of
a
court
case
worker
that
she
be
put
on
probation.
so
joyce
was
a,
in
trouble
and
b,
although
she
was
not
on
probation
she
was
in
the
status
close
to
it
that
a
lay
person
might
have
described
as
probation.
and
furthermore,
as
the
evidence
of
the
post-conviction
proceeding
showed,
in
fact
she
did
call
it
probation
because
on
the
saturday
before
the
thursday
of
the
alleged
rape
by
the
petitioners,
she
went
out
with
a
boyfriend
of
hers
pat
stevens
and
she
told
pat
stevens
let's
stay
in
laurel.
let's
not
go
down
to
hyattsville
because
i'm
on
probation.
and
in
fact,
she
wasn't
on
probation.
she
was
in
this
near
probation
status.
this
evidence,
the
materiality
of
it
can
possibly
be
controverted
because
it
would
have
corroborated
critical
testimony
of
the
petitioners
which
i
believe
obviously
negatives
rape
and
it
would
have
removed
a
false
impression
created
before
the
jury
by
the
cross-examination
of
the
defendants
and
by
the
state's
witness'
denial
of
being
on
probation.
mr.
joseph
forer
was
not
known,
he
tried
to
find
out
what
there
was
against
her
in
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
and
montgomery's
county
because
he
knew
the
boy's
story
and
he
was
refused
to
access
for
the
record.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
testified
that
he
did
not.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
question
of
the
knowledge.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
just
don't
know.
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
was
i
the
petitioner's
or
if
the
petitioner
did
that.
those
petitions
are
usually
stereotype
mimeographed
sheets.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
they
--
the
judge
--
we
have
subpoenaed
the
records
and
the
judge
wouldn't
let
us
--
judge
moorman
wouldn't
let
us
put
it
in
evidence
and
find
that
we
got
it
in
stipulation.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
could
have
been
produced
by
--
if
the
court
allowed
it
we
had
got
a
written
permission
--
mr.
joseph
forer
both
courts.
we
have
got
a
written
permission
from
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
and
a
ruling
which
i
cannot
to
this
day
understand
and
which
i
cannot
explain
the
basis
for,
judge
moorman
refused
to
introduce
an
evidence
so
then
we
finally
managed
to
get
in
the
key
point
by
means
of
stipulation.
let
me
now
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
prosecution.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
prosecution
consisted
of
the
state's
attorney
and
the
investigating
police.
for
present
purposes,
that
means
party
who
was
the
state's
attorney
and
who
tried
the
case
and
lieutenant
whalen
who
was
the
detective
in-charge
of
the
investigation.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
but
the
only
knowledge
that
--
but
in
fact
all
of
the
knowledge--
mr.
joseph
forer
was
in
this
two.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
the
only
way
we
established
knowledge
was
from
their
own
lips.
now,
kardy
the
state's
attorney
and
whalen
the
head
of
the
detectives
knew
the
evidence
chose
this
and
they
were
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
trial
court
to
know
about
the
attempted
suicide
and
about
the
second
rape
accusation
but
they
knew
them
only
in
a
general
way
and
they
didn't
know
the
details
and
all
the
subsidiary
evidence
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
were
not
interested
and
made
no
effort
to
investigate.
kardy
for
example
testified
that
he
knew
that
he
know
that
joyce
had
taken
this
overdose
of
drugs
and
he
assumed
that
it
was
intentional
and
motivated.
he
happened
to
have
their
motive
but
he
assumed
that
it
was
a
suicide
attempt.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
state's
attorney.
he
also
knew
that
joyce
have
been
involved
in
an
allegation
of
another
rape
and
that
nothing
had
come
of
this
allegation,
not
even
the
produce
formal
charges.
but
he
hadn't
bothered
to
find
out
and
didn't
know
that
the
allegation
was
made
by
joyce
because
he
didn't
bother
to
find
out.
and
the
same
thing
was
true
of
lieutenant
whalen,
the
detective
lieutenant.
although
after
all,
although
he
didn't
know
immediately
that
joyce
had
instigated
the
charge,
he
got
the
information
of
this
second
alleged
rape
from
the
girl's
mother.
and
that
by
itself
should
indicate,
it
seems
to
me
a
definite
possibility
that
the
complaint
originated
with
the
girl.
now
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yeah,
he
got
a
telephone
call
from
the
girl's
mother
and
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yeah,
that's
right.
and
he
said,
don't
bother
me
with
that.
now,
in
short,
they
did
know,
they
know
she
had
taken
this
overdose,
they
assume
that
the
suicide,
they
knew
that
she
was
involved
in
the
second
rape
accusation.
now
if
you
limit,
if
you
limit
the
state's
knowledge
or
the
responsibility
of
the
state
merely
to
what
they
knew
they
actually
knew
without
more,
we
say
that
under
the
authorities
and
under
any
kind
of
reason,
that
was
material
in
and
of
itself.
they
knew
there
was
a
suicide
attempt
or
they
knew
enough
about
it.
they
knew
there
was
a
second
rape
accusation
which
apparently
was
false
and
they
had
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
joyce
have
instigated
it.
and
that
would
be
enough.
but
i
want
to
go
further,
there's
another
grounds
for
materiality
here.
not
only
would
this
evidence
have
been
enough
in
and
out
itself.
but
if
you
assume
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
did
that
there
is
a
duty
to
divulge
anything
that
is
possibly
material
and
that
this
duty
was
breached
here.
once
you
have
a
breach
of
a
duty
to
divulge,
then
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
breach
of
the
duty
was
prejudicial,
you're
past
the
question
of
breach
which
means
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
material.
then
you
should
look,
not
only
at
the
value
of
the
precise
things
known
to
the
prosecution
and
not
divulge
but
also
at
what
the
defense
was
in
all
likelihood
and
in
years
surely
would
have
discovered
if
the
duty
had
not
been
breached.
if
kardy
and
whalen
had
told
the
defense
what
they
knew,
any
diligent
defense
would
have
checked
with
the
police
department
of
prince
george's
county
and
would
have
gotten
the
whole
story
that
lieutenant
wheeler
had
knew
and
would
have
had
everything
else.
and
this
was
a
point
made
by
the
dissenting
opinion.
the
dissenting
opinion
said,
in
order
to
determine
materiality,
first,
what
they
actually
knew
was
itself
material,
but
secondly
that
having
breached
the
duty
of
divulgence
of
disposure
that
this
information
was
material
because
of
--
it
would
have
been
a
great
value
for
the
defense
by
further
investigation.
now,
we
have
an
alternative
theory
for
--
on
the
question
of
knowledge,
this
is
an
alternative
theory
with
regard
to
category
one
of
the
suppressed
evidence
that
is
the
history
of
the
false
rape
accusation
and
the
attempted
suicide.
but
it
is
the
only
theory
that
we
have
with
regard
to
the
nondisclosure
of
the
fact
that
she
was
in
this
near
probation
status.
we
say
that
under
certain
circumstances
for
the
purposes
of
the
suppression
doctrine,
it
is
right
to
charge
the
prosecution,
not
only
with
what
they
actually
knew
but
also
with
constructive
knowledge
of
what
they
should
have
known
if
they
had
conducted
an
unbiased
investigation
and
if
they
had
shown
the
most
rudimentary
diligence
in
the
performance
of
the
obligation
that
they
owe
to
the
state
as
public
officials
and
to
all
accused
to
investigate
allegations
of
crime
with
some
kind
of
elementary
diligence.
and
we
say
here
that
this
duty
to
the
public
was
breached.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
think
that
overstates
my
position
justice
black.
i
say,
well
first
of
all,
the
prosecution
here
did
investigate.
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
they
came
upon
evidence
which
was
indicative
of
innocence.
instead
of
performing
the
duty
to
conduct
an
unbiased
investigation,
they
turned
their
back
on
the
others.
they
deliberately
closed
their
eyes
--
mr.
joseph
forer
are
they
certainly
do.
they
owed
a
duty
to
the
defendants
and
they
owed
a
duty
to
the
public.
and
at
minimum
that
duty
is
not
to
deliberately
close
their
eyes
to
exculpatory
or
possibly
exculpatory
evidence
in
order
that
they
may
then
have
an
excuse
not
to
turn
the
evidence
over
to
the
defense.
now,
all
i
can
say
justice
black
is
that
there
is
a
minimum
of
authority
on
this
point.
this
court
hasn't
spoken
on
that
point.
there
are
a
few
lower
court
cases
which
do
hex
the
prosecution
with
constructive
knowledge
because
it
was
information
which
they
should
have
known.
now,
let
me
rehearse
the
circumstances
here
which
called
upon
them
to
make
some
kind
of
an
investigation.
first,
the
medical
testimony,
it
was
indicative
of
intercourse
but
not
of
forcible
penetration.
you
have
a
16-year
old
girl
alone
in
the
woods
late
at
night
with
a
21-year
old
man,
originally
with
three
men.
she
ran
a
great
distance
of
30
feet
to
escape
being
ravished.
she
was
first
to
offer
sex
to
john
giles.
she
didn't
resist,
she
didn't
expostulate,
it
was
capital
offense,
the
defense
was
indigent,
the
information
was
--
the
indicated
information
to
check
was
readily
available
to
the
prosecution
and
the
police.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
there's
a
little
dirt
path
that
was
right
down
to
the
river
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
about
midnight.
mr.
joseph
forer
who
were
doing?
the
petitioners?
mr.
joseph
forer
they
had
been
fishing
and
swimming
in
the
river.
as
they
came
out
of
the
river
they
had
to
go
past
the
car.
mr.
joseph
forer
drinking,
they
had
some
beer.
yeah
well,
i
think
they
had
had
one
6
--pack
of
beer
for
about
four
people.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
testified
that
when
she
and
john
giles
were
alone
in
the
wood,
that
she
said
to
him
that
she
would
like
to
have
them
to
have
intercourse
with
her
if
he
helped
her
get
away.
this
was
her
own
testimony
and
since
she
never
--
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
what
she
said.
but,
may
i
point
out
that
since
she
never
told
john
giles
that
she
had
a
mental
reservation,
or
that
she
had
changed
her
mind.
the
alleged
rape
by
john
giles
comes
down
to
a
breach
of
contract
for
lack
of
consideration
that
he
didn't
have
to
get
away.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
it
wasn't
a
rape
at
all.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
but
of
course
under
the
law
of
maryland,
the
unchastity
of
a
woman
who
has
been
raped
is
admissible
at
the
conviction
for
the
purpose
of
determining
sentence
but
we're
not
going
into
that
here.
but
if
she
was
raped,
she
was
raped,
our
point
is
that
she
wasn't
raped
and
that
the
state
suppressed
evidence
which
to
any
reasonable
mind
would
have
corroborated
and
made
plausible
the
testimony
of
these
two
young
men
who
otherwise
had
nowhere
else
to
turn.
mr.
joseph
forer
they?
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
now,
let
me
stay
for
a
minute
on
the
policy
consideration.
it
said
well,
this
is
the
past
of
nondisclosure.
the
prosecution
doesn't
have
to
be
the
defense
counsel.
the
prosecution
can't
be
expected
to
disclose
information
available
to
the
defendant.
now,
the
information
here
was
not
available
for
the
defense.
and
the
state
is
in
a
position
where
it
must
disclose.
it
not
only
has
superior
resources
it
has
an
obligation
to
see
that
justice
is
done,
as
all
prosecutors
always
say,
make
luncheon
speeches
but
do
not
necessarily
carry
out.
and
the
state's
nondisclosure
of
exculpatory
evidence
can't
be
excused
even
if
there
is
as
there
was
not
here
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defense.
supposed
both
were
at
fault,
it's
a
different
kind
of
fault,
where
the
fault
is
refusal
to
--
is
a
concealment,
a
withholding
of
the
information
that
you
have,
on
one
side
the
prosecution
side
and
the
fault
on
the
defense
side
is
a
failure
to
acquire
the
information
which
it
could
have
gotten
if
it
had
tried.
where
the
prosecution
fails
to
disclose
information
that
it
has
the
best
you
can
say
for
it
is
that
it
is
deliberately
exploiting
a
mistake
or
negligence
by
the
defense
counsel
in
order
to
try
to
get
his
client
sent
to
the
chair
or
convicted
for
a
long
time.
and
even
if
the
prosecution
isn't
being
malicious
about
it
then
at
least
they
had
the
last
clear
chance
and
tort
terms
and
they
didn't
take
advantage
of
it
nor
is
this
passive
nondisclosure.
the
vice
is
not
the
failure
to
disclose.
the
vice
is
prosecuting
without
failing
to
disclose.
and
there
was
nothing
passive
about
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
and
this
nondisclosure
was
no
more
a
passive
thing
than
a
stationary
part
of
a
moving
machine.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
my
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
don't
--
obviously
the
state
isn't
required
to
disclose
a
trivial
matter.
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
i
haven't
said
a
stage
of
disclose
everything.
now
maybe
in
time
there
will
adopted
the
full
discovery
and
rules
that
justice
brennan
advocated
in
the
speech
he
made
in
the
washington
university.
that's
different,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
cases
where
the
prosecution
has
breached
its
duty
because
it
has
suppressed
something
in
significant.
i
want
to
talk
--
mr.
joseph
forer
of
course
it
is.
mr.
joseph
forer
actually
listed
in
the
word
material.
mr.
joseph
forer
you
mean
the
two
categories?(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
forer
the
point
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
rape,
at
the
time
when
she
was
supposed
to
be
saying
that
she
was
on
probation,
she
was
at
that
very
moment
in
this
status
of
near
probation.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
any
winched
phonological
line,
the
only
question
--
the
only
role
that
chronology
might
have
is
the
effect
the
materiality,
but
once
you
grant
the
information
of
material,
then
it
should
be
disclosed
regardless
of
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
forer
but
the
material
and
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
the
material
for
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
but
it
was
also
a
material
as
affirmative
corroboration
of
the
defendant's
story.
that's
particularly
true
of
the
probation
evidence.
yes
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
in
most
instances,
that's
right
but
i
mean
if
there's
going
to
be
a
disclosure
it
should
be
made
before
the
trial
is
over.
now,
there
may
be
instances
where
the
prosecution
is
justified
in
delaying
disclosure.
but
i
just
don't
see
how
it's
possible
to
say
that
a
prosecutor
can
actively
seek
to
send
people
to
the
chair
as
we
did
here.
in
the
mean
time,
keeping
in
his
back
pocket
all
the
way
to
the
very
end
information
which
was
critical
and
which
might
have
shown
their
innocence.
mr.
joseph
forer
lieutenant
whalen
testified
that
he
did
not
know.
we
thought
he
did.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
but
he
should
have
known.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
believe
me,
if
the
social
status
of
these
people
have
been
different
he
would
have
known
rather
than
--
mr.
joseph
forer
for
instance,
he
said
to
john
giles,
remember
this
was
after
joyce
had
already
denied
she
was
on
probation.
and
john
giles
himself
was
on
probation.
so
he
said,
so
you
went
in
the
woods
and
you
were
on
probation
and
she
was
on
probation
now
what
did
you
two
probationers
talked
about?
and
then
he
kept
talking
about
probation,
probation,
probation,
rubbing
into
the
jury
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
that
she
wasn't
on
probation.
it's
very
much
like
that
alcorta
against
texas
case
in
which
the
state,
they
used
evidence
which
was
literally
true
by
which
because
it
failed
of
being
supplemented
by
additional
evidence
created
a
false
impression
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
guess
if
you
read
the
whole
record,
you
will
that
somewhere
there's
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
prior
criminal
conviction
for
housebreaking.
and
presumably
that
was
his
only
criminal
conviction
presumably
he
was
on
probation
with
that.(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
asked
the
girl,
joyce,
on
redirect
examination.
you
see
the
way
it
came
up
joyce
of
course
testified
before
the
defendant.
the
defense
counsel
in
cross-examining
her,
said
to
her,
“didn't
you
say
to
them
that
you
were
on
probation
and
would
have
to
claim
rape?”
and
she
said,
“no,
i
didn't
say
that.”
then
on
redirect
examination,
the
prosecutor
said
to
her,
“were
you
on
probation
at
that
time?”
and
she
said,
“no.”
then
when
the
petitioners
testified
that
she
had
told
them
she
was
on
probation,
then
on
cross-examination
of
the
petitioners
and
we
give
the
references
in
our
brief,
he
ridiculed
that
testimony.
whatever
term
i
have
left,
i
will
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
stipulation
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
episode
in
the
woods
that
was
pending
in
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
a
petition
for
her
commitment
and
in
connection
with
that
petition
that
was
pending
a
recommendation
by
the
court's
case
worker
that
joyce
be
put
on
probation.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yeah.
mr.
joseph
forer
yeah,
but
there
was
a
reason
for
that.
what
happened
was
that
the
montgomery
county
police
took
joyce
and
had
her
committed
to
the
--
to
an
institution
--had
her
committed
to
a
school
the
montrose
school
during
prior
to
and
during
the
trial.
by
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
and
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
then
later
after
accepting
jurisdiction
bring
her
in
this
institution
temporarily
until
after
she
had
testified
then
discharged
her
on
the
grounds
that
they
didn't
have
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
forer
basis
of
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
basis
of
her
commitment
was
a
petition
brought
by
or
instigated
by
lieutenant
whalen
in
which
--
would
you
give
me
a
moment
--
if
you
will
look
on
page
275
of
the
record,
there
is
the
proceeding
in
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
now
if
you
look
at
the
case
hearing
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
this
hearing
was
held
the
same
day
she
got
out
of
the
hospital
august
5.
mr.
joseph
forer
september
5,
same
day
she
got
out
of
the
hospital
after
the
suicide
attempt.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes,
and
the
testimony
of
the
post-conviction
proceeding
of
lieutenant
whalen
was
that
he
would
arrange
this
hearing
in
montgomery
county.
if
you'll
look
at
the
very
top
it
says
joyce
roberts
and
it
gives
her
address
at
hyattsville,
maryland
which
everybody
knows
is
in
prince
george's
county.
if
you
look
at
--
on
page
277
you'll
see
that
on
april
30th,
the
case
was
closed
on
the
grounds
that
she
is
no
longer
residing
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
although
everybody
knew
that
she
was
not
residing
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
begin
with.
and
what
happened
here
was
that
while
she
was
--
before
this
case
was
dismissed
in
prince
george's
county
the
charge
against
her
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
jurisdiction
had
been
taken
by
montgomery
county.
so,
that's
why
nothing
ever
came
of
the
case
in
prince
george's
county.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
was
not
actually
on
probation,
she
was
in
trouble
which
is
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence
and
she
was
in
a
status
where
she
could
describe
this
probation
and
did.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
wasn't
but
she
referred
to
it
is
probation
and
the
important
thing
was
what
she
was
saying
when
she
said
that
she
was
on
probation
and
she
certainly
was
in
trouble.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
certainly
are.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
are
not
only
willing,
they
have
insisted.
let
me
first
answer
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised.
there
was
no,
no
pre-sentence
investigation
in
this
case.
the
judge
could
have
ordered
one,
he
did
fail
to
order
one.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
do
know
--
mr.
joseph
forer
not
only
do
i
know
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
within
the
--
in
the
five-day
interval
that
conducted
such
an
investigation.
i
do
know
there
was
none.
secondly,
there
was
no
pre-sentence
investigation
between
verdict
and
sentence.
the
judge
just
in
order
and
there
was
not
and
he
sentenced
him
to
death
without
pre-sentence
investigation
and
after
a
five-minute
hearing
in
which
the
only
thing
that
was
offered
was
some
reputation
testimony
by
one
person
which
is
in
the
record.
secondly,
on
the
question
of
sentencing,
there
is
--
we
would
not
be
satisfied
to
have
a
case
where
a
portion
of
the
law
i'll
say
that
right
now.
but
it
is
true
and
this
is
relevant
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
fourth
circuit
case
construing
maryland
law
in
the
advanced
sheets.
it's
not
in
neither
brief.
whitaker
against
the
warden
362
federal
second
838,
362
f.2d
838
which
construing
maryland
law
on
the
question
of
sentence
says
that
it
is
unquestionably
clear
that
the
promiscuity
of
a
rape
victim
would
be
admissible
in
mitigation
of
sentence.
i
want
to
--
on
the
question
of
petitioner's
exhibit
3
--
mr.
joseph
forer
838,
362
federal
second
838
of
the
advanced
sheet.
on
the
question
of
petitioner's
exhibit
3
which
is
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
hearing.
i
just
don't
understand
our
counsel
can
say
we
didn't
offer
it.
it's
right
there
in
the
record
at
page
173
of
the
record
we
offered
it.
the
state
objected
and
the
judge
moorman
excluded
it
on
the
state's
objection.
why
he
did
it,
i
can't
understand.
if
you
want
to
see
the
discussion
that
went
on
the
full
evidentiary
transcript
which
is
in
the
certified
record.
mr.
joseph
forer
whatever,
we
have
a
very
rough
time
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding
getting
any
evidence
in.
mr.
joseph
forer
were
frustrated.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
including
testimony
on
the
records.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
what
happened
was
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
it
was
more
than
that.
he
admitted
being
at
the
hearing.
he
showed
a
very
weak
memory
to
the
point
where
he
couldn't
even
remember
things
that
the
hearing
folks
are
saying.
but
he
did
say
that
on
--
he
wasn't
at
the
hearing
at
all
times.
he
said
he
went
in
and
out
a
couple
of
times.
that's
the
gravamen
of
his
testimony.
he
was
at
the
hearing
but
he
said
that
he
didn't
remember
some
of
it
and
he
wasn't
in
the
hearing
every
minute
of
the
hearing.
on
the
question
of
what
transpired
at
the
car,
the
version
given
by
mr.
needle
seems
to
me
to
be
an
inaccurate
account
of
the
state's
evidence.
it
certainly
does
not
correspond
to
the
contrary
evidence
of
the
defense.
furthermore,
among
the
new
evidence
that
we
sought
to
get
a
hearing
on
was
a
great
mass
of
evidence
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
we
claim
suppressed
including
evidence
relating
to
stewart
foster
and
the
accounts
given
by
stewart
foster
after
--
immediately
after
this
alleged
rape
which
would
have
served
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
the
defendants
that
they
would
not
the
aggressors.
they
did
not
provoke
the
altercation
and
we
were
never
able
to
get
that
new
evidence
in
because
of
the
maryland
three-day
rule.
now,
we're
not
claiming
that
the
evident
information
that
was
suppressed
proves
innocence.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
information
was
of
a
quality
that
the
defense
should
have
had
the
opportunity
to
present
that
or
the
fruits
of
the
information
to
the
jury.
and
it
wasn't
up
to
the
prosecutor
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
evidence
should
be
given
to
was
at
least
he
could
have
done
was
leave
it
to
the
judge
as
to
whether
the
jury
should
pass
on
it.
and
now,
at
this
late
date,
the
court
of
appeals
says
he
probably
breached
his
obligation
but
the
evidence
wasn't
sufficiently
exculpatory
and
in
that
respect,
the
court
of
appeals
is
invading
the
providence
of
the
jury
which
in
maryland
law
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
exculpatory
value
of
admissible
evidence
and
in
that
respect,
we
were
denied
equal
protection
under
all
the
opinions
in
the
brady
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
have
about
three
minutes
on
the
question
of
the
admissibility?
mr.
needle
also
states
the
maryland
law
very
seriously
when
he
says
that
there
would
not
be
admissible
under
maryland
law
the
fact
of
a
prior
false
rape
claim.
in
smallwood
versus
warden
which
was
a
case
by
the
federal
district
court
of
maryland
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
chief
judge
thompson
granted
habeas
corpus
because
of
a
suppression
of
a
prior
rape
accusation
where
there
wasn't
even
evidence
that
it
was
false.
in
this
case,
neither
the
majority
nor
the
minority
adopted
his
theory
that
this
evidence
is
clearly
been
held
inadmissible.
they
said
it
might
well
have
been
admissible
and
we've
all
--
but
we
don't
pass
on
it
in
this
content.
now,
what
he
is
talking
about
is
the
case
of
rau
against
the
state
which
was
decided
in
1919
which
was
a
statutory
rape
case
in
which
the
evidence
that
the
child
involved
had
made
a
prior
accusation
was
offered
solely
on
the
theory
that
it
impugned
the
character
of
the
girl.
at
this
time,
because
there
was
so
little
knowledge
of
psychiatry,
it
wasn't
offered
on
the
theory
for
which
it
is
now
considered
admissible,
namely
the
theory
of
showing
either
mental
illness
or
mental
bias,
a
kind
of
corrupt
bias
against
the
class
of
people
namely
men
of
whom
the
accused
are
members.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
1919
well
this
kind
of
evidence
is
not
admissible
as
going
to
character
because
we
don't
care
about
character.
but
that
is
why
neither
smallwood
against
the
warden
nor
the
majority
here
said
this
means
that
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
for
other
purposes.
for
other
purposes
it
is
clearly
admissible.
of
those
grounds,
i
want
to
thank
the
court
for
giving
me
the
extra
time.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
as
a
proceeding
under
the
maryland
post-conviction
procedure
act
which
is
a
statutory
substitute
for
habeas
corpus
and
coram
nobis.
the
petitioners
who
were
serving
life
sentences
and
are
serving
life
sentences
following
the
commutation
of
death
sentences
challenged
their
conviction
for
rape
under
the
act
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
first
question
that
i
will
argue
is
whether
the
conviction
of
the
petitioners
was
obtained
in
violation
of
due
process
by
reason
of
the
prosecution
suppression
of
material
evidence
favorable
to
the
accused.
and
for
that
purpose,
i
must
first
give
you
a
condensed
summary
of
the
evidence
which
came
out
at
the
petitioner's
criminal
trial.
the
petitioners
are
brothers.
on
the
night
of
july
20,
1961,
they
were
swimming
and
fishing
in
the
patuxent
river
near
their
home.
as
they
left
the
river
with
the
companion
joseph
johnson,
they
encountered
500
feet
from
the
river
in
deep
woods
an
automobile.
in
that
automobile
were
two
people,
a
16-year
old
girl
named
joyce,
and
a
21-year
old
man
stewart
foster.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
was
late
at
night
close
to
midnight.
an
altercation
started
at
the
car
between
the
giles
brothers
and
johnson
on
the
one
hand
and
stewart
foster
on
the
other.
the
testimony
is
in
conflict
as
to
what
caused
the
altercation
and
who
provoked
it
and
for
present
purposes,
i'd
not
go
into
that.
but
very
early
in
the
altercation,
at
the
time
when
james
giles
and
johnson
threw
some
stones
at
the
car,
joyce
ran
out
of
the
car
and
into
the
woods
along
the
side
of
the
dark
road.
according
to
her
testimony,
she
ran
a
distance
of
30
feet
at
which
point
she
stopped
because
she
said
she
was
out
of
breathe
and
she
had
fallen.
john
giles
soon
afterwards
left
the
car
while
the
altercation
was
still
going
on
to
come
back
into
the
woods
and
came
upon
joyce.
the
two
of
them
were
together
there
for
approximately
10
or
15
minutes
during
which
time
they
had
some
conversation.
joyce
herself
testified
that
she
was
the
first
person
to
introduce
the
subject
of
sex.
in
that
she
offered
john
giles
to
have
intercourse
with
him
if
he
would
help
her
get
away.
john
giles
also
testified
to
that
offer.
but
he
gave
it
a
little
more
body,
he
testified
that
she
also
explained
to
him
that
she
was
on
probation
and
couldn't
afford
to
get
caught
in
the
woods
and
didn't
want
to
get
in
any
trouble
and
for
that
reason
she
was
anxious
that
he
help
her
get
away.
after
they
have
been
quietly
in
the
woods
together
for
a
while.
the
altercation
of
the
car
ended
when
stewart
foster
was
knocked
out
and
then
ran
off.
the
other
two
young
negroes,
joseph
johnson
and
james
giles,
came
into
the
woods
along
the
same
path
and
they
came
upon
john
giles
and
joyce.
at
this
point,
there's
a
very
serious
cleavage
in
the
testimony.
joyce
testified
that
the
three
men
were
there
and
that
each
one
of
the
three
they're
after
having
intercourse
with
her.
she
testified
that
she
did
not
resist,
she
testified
that
she
made
no
outcry,
she
also
testified
that
she
made
no
remonstrance.
she
didn't
even
say
to
them,
“please
let
me
alone.”
she
also
took
off
her
own
clothes.
this
was
her
own
testimony.
she
said
she
submitted
this
way
because
she
was
frightened.
the
giles
brothers
testified
that
as
the
two
who
had
been
delayed
came
along
the
path,
joyce
called
them
over
saying
to
john,
“well
i
know
what
you
boys
want.”
then
she
called
them
over
and
said,
“i
know
what
you
boys
like”
and
then
urged
them
to
have
intercourse
with
her.
she
took
off
her
own
clothes,
she
was
the
stage
master
of
the
affair.
she
directed
the
order
of
intercourse.
and
then
the
course
of
this
transaction,
she
told
them
that
she
had
had
16
or
17
other
boys
that
week
and
two
or
three
more
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
she
told
james
giles
that
she
was
in
trouble,
and
that
if
she
were
caught
in
the
woods,
she
would
have
to
claim
that
she
was
raped.
she
repeated
to
john
giles
that
she
was
on
probation
and
that
if
she
were
caught
in
the
woods,
she
said
she
would
have
to
claim
she
was
raped.
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
giles
brothers,
john
giles
refused
the
invitation
of
the
intercourse,
the
other
two
accepted
the
intercourse.
at
the
trial,
on
redirect
examination
by
the
state,
joyce
was
asked
if
she
was
in
fact
on
probation
at
the
time
of
this
episode.
she
denied
that
she
was
on
probation
and
thereafter
on
cross
examination
of
the
petitioners,
the
state
very
effectively
ridiculed
their
testimony
that
she
had
told
them
that
she
was
on
probation.
at
the
trial,
the
giles
brothers
being
indigent
or
represented
by
court
appointed
counsel.
joseph
johnson,
the
third
man
in
the
affair
was
also
indicted
but
he
got
his
case
severed
and
transferred
at
orlando
county
and
he's
not
in
this
case
although
it's
an
open
secret
that
his
faith
abides
this
case.
the
trial
started
on
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
said
it's
an
open
secret
that
his
faith
abides
the
result
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
has
been
tried,
convicted,
sentenced
to
death
commuted.
post
conviction
petition
filed
and
by
agreement
with
the
state
every
batch
has
been
held
up
to
see
what
happens
here.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
got
a
severance
and
a
change
of
venue.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
no,
this
happened
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
patuxent
river
is
the
border
line
between
montgomery
and
howard
and
they
were
on
the
montgomery
county
side.
now,
the
trial
started
one
day
december
4
and
it
ended
the
next
that's
from
the
choosing
of
a
jury
for
the
jury
verdict
of
guilty.
the
only
defense
witnesses
for
the
petitioners
with
the
technical
and
academic
exception
that
the
defense
counsel
also
called
two
of
the
policemen
and
they
tried
unsuccessfully
to
get
them
to
admit
that
joyce
had
originally
told
the
police
that
she
was
even
raped
by
two
men
rather
than
by
three.
they
denied
it
and
the
only
listed
to
help
defense,
the
whole
thing
was
a
factless
maneuver
because
joyce
had
already
admitted
that
she
had
originally
told
that
to
the
police.
the
case
went
to
the
jury.
it
was
a
conflict
between
credibility.
this
all
white
jury
had
to
decide
whether
to
believe
this
16-year
old
white
girl
or
these
two
young
negroes.
and
the
story
that
these
two
young
negroes
gave
was
the
most
implausible
story.
it
was
that
under
these
rather
frightening
conditions,
the
16-year
old
child
solicited
intercourse
with
three
negro
strangers.
for
the
jury
to
believe
their
story,
they
would
have
to
find
that
this
16-year
old
child
was
incredibly
wanted
that
she
was
probably
mentally
disturbed
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
either
condition.
they
would
also
have
to
believe
that
this
girl
who
was
not
on
probation
went
around
intuitively
telling
people
that
she
was
on
probation.
the
jury
found
them
guilty
and
their
story
didn't
impress
the
trial
judge,
judge
pugh,
very
much
either
because
although
under
maryland
law,
he
had
a
choice
of
sentence
from
18
months
they
day
he
imposed
to
that
sentence.
these
two
brothers
were
at
that
time
aged
20
and
22.
joseph
johnson
didn't
feel
any
better
in
this
trial
at
minneapolis.
after
the
appeals
were
exhausted
on
november
16,
1962,
11
months
after
the
verdict,
a
new
trial
motion
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
alleging
the
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
circuit
court
denied
this
motion
without
even
looking
at
the
newly
discovered
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
motion
was
filed
too
late.
they
said
under
maryland
rules
if
you
want
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
base
of
newly
discovered
evidence
you
have
to
file
within
three
days
after
verdict.
this
ruling
was
affirmed
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
subsequently,
in
october
of
1963,
governor
tawes
commuted
the
death
sentences
of
the
three
men,
that
is,
for
two
petitioners
and
johnson
to
life.
this
post
conviction
proceeding
was
filed
about
six
months
after
that
in
may
of
1964.
it
was
heard
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
though
before
a
different
judge
than
the
sentencing
judge.
and
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
circuit
court
found
that
the
petitioners
had
been
denied
due
process
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
had
suppressed
material
exculpatory
evidence.
the
state
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
--
the
court
of
appeals
heard
the
case
en
banc
and
they
reversed
five
to
two.
and
that
then
we
came
here.
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
evidence
which
came
out
at
the
post
conviction
trial
and
a
description
of
the
evidence
that
we
claim
was
suppressed,
i
would
like
to
mention
a
couple
of
the
legal
issues
that
are
involved.
the
legal
issues
in
the
suppression
point
all
arise
out
of
one
sentence.
they
all
arise
within
the
framework
of
one
sentence
over
the
court's
decision,
1963
decision
in
brady
against
maryland.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“we
now
hold
that
the
suppression
by
the
prosecution
of
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
upon
request
violates
due
process
where
the
evidence
is
material
either
to
guilt
or
to
punishment
irrespective
of
the
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
the
prosecution.”
now,
in
that
case,
the
qualification
of
on
request
is
explainable
by
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
the
evidence
which
had
been
withheld
had
been
requested.
in
fact,
none
of
the
lower
courts
which
have
passed
on
suppression
cases
have
ever
made
a
requirement
that
the
defense
had
to
request
the
information
before
the
nondisclosure
could
be
excused.
and
this
is
true
of
cases
which
were
decided
before
brady
including
two
third
circuit
cases
which
brady
cited
with
approval
of
stating
the
correct
rule
and
two
of
cases
cited
after
brady
and
it
was
true
in
this
very
case.
in
this
very
case,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
did
not
require
a
showing
of
a
request
for
disclosure
and
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
--
if
you
--
a
requirement
of
a
request
would
defeat
the
rule
because
the
time
when
a
defense
needs
disclosure
the
most,
is
when
the
defense
is
so
ignorant
and
so
uninformed
that
it
doesn't
know
what
to
request
or
even
whether
to
request.
so
for
the
future
purposes,
i
shall
assume
that
the
brady
rule
applies
without
the
need
for
a
request
for
the
exposure
abiding
the
facts.
that
brings
me
to
the
second
requirement
of
the
brady
case
and
that
is
that
the
withheld
evidence
be
material.
and
brady
didn't
explain
the
meaning
of
the
test
of
materiality.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
didn't
explain
it
either
but
if
you
analyze
what
they
did,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
held
that
evidence
is
immaterial
unless
it
were
so
strong
that
as
to
be
full
through.
if
there
was
any
possibility
that
it
might
not
have
affected
the
result
then
it
wasn't
material.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
analogy
here
should
be
to
the
test
of
materiality
which
this
court
develop
in
cases
like
the
napue
case
where
the
fault
was
the
introduction
of
testimony
known
to
the
prosecution
to
be
incorrect
and
the
failure
of
the
prosecution
to
correct
the
incorrect
testimony.
and
the
tests
stated
by
this
court
in
the
napue
case
was
that
the
evidence,
the
wrongful
--
the
admitted
evidence,
was
material
and
tainted
the
conviction
if
the
false
testimony,
“may
have
had
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial”
and
the
court
has
applied
the
same
tests
to
cases
where
evidence
where
illegally
obtained
evidence
and
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
admitted.
so
in
they
against
connecticut,
the
test
was
whether
the
admission
of
the
evidence
--
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
admission
of
the
evidence
might
have
affected
the
result.
now,
this
kind
of
case
is
a
corollary
case
to
the
use
of
false
evidence
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
same
test
of
materiality
should
apply
namely
if
the
evidence
if
the
evidence
have
been
revealed,
was
there
a
reasonable
possibility
that
it
would
have
affected
the
result.
in
our
view,
this
test
of
materiality
was
more
than
that.
and
now
i
come
to
our
description
of
the
evidence
that
we
claim
was
suppressed
and
which
was
brought
out
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding.
the
evidence
falls
under
two
categories.
the
first
category
is
evidence
of
the
events
between
the
episode
the
alleged
rape
of
july
20,
1961
and
the
trial
in
december
1961.
the
evidence
shows
this,
on
the
9th
of
august
26,
1961,
one
month
after
the
alleged
rape,
three
months
before
the
trial,
joyce
went
to
a
party,
and
at
the
party
she
had
intercourse
with
two
men;
one
in
the
bathroom,
one
in
the
yard.
early
the
next
morning,
she
took
an
overdose
of
drugs
and
a
suicide
attempt
and
she
was
taken
to
a
hospital
and
was
kept
in
the
hospital
in
the
psychiatric
ward
of
the
hospital
for
10
days
with
admitting
diagnosis
of
a
psychopathic
personality.
while
she
was
in
the
psychopathic
ward
of
the
hospital
she
was
visited
by
a
boyfriend
of
hers
named
busty.
busty
asked
her
why
did
she
attempt
suicide.
she
told
busty
that
she
had
been
raped
the
night
before
the
suicide
attempt
by
these
two
men
that
whom
she
had
had
intercourse
at
the
park,
and
she
gave
him
the
names
of
the
men
and
all
the
detail.
busty
reported
this
rather
officiously
because
she
didn't
ask
him
though.
busty
reported
this
to
her
parents.
her
mother
first
called
sergeant
way
up
in
montgomery
county
police
who
was
in-charged
of
the
investigation
resulting
in
the
conviction
of
petitioners.
and
she
told
sergeant
whalen
that
joyce
had
been
raped
again.
so
whalen
asked
her
where
did
this
take
place
and
she
said
in
prince
george's
county.
so
whalen
said
well
don't
bother
me,
tell
it
to
the
prince
george's
county
police
and
presumably
he
went
back
to
sleep.
so
she
or
her
husband
reported
it
to
the
prince
george's
county
police.
detective
sergeant
wheeler
of
the
prince
george's
county
police
came
to
the
hospital
to
interview
joyce
in
connection
with
this
complaint.
when
he
interviewed
her,
the
first
thing
she
told
them
was
that
these
two
men
at
the
party
had
had
relations
with
her
against
her
will.
but
he
then
questioned
her
further.
in
the
course
of
the
questioning
it
became
perfectly
apparent
that
she
had
not
been
raped,
that
she
engaged
in
voluntary
intercourse,
she
had
put
up
no
resistance
and
that
the
most
she
had
was
an
unexpressed
mental
reservation.
she
really
didn't
want
to
engage
an
intercourse
with
these
two
boys
at
that
time.
she
said
at
that
particular
time
because
she
was
afraid
that
if
all
the
other
boys
at
the
party
got
to
know
about
it,
they
would
all
insist
on
having
intercourse
with
her.
otherwise,
she
said
she
wouldn't
even
have
had
this
mental;
reservation,
and
she
also
admitted
that
in
the
past
with
one
of
the
two
men
with
whom
she
have
had
intercourse
at
the
party,
she
had
had
relation
with.
they
were
white.
which
boy?
you
mean
the
second
rape
claim?
mr.
joseph
forer
they
were
white,
they
were
white
mr.
joseph
forer
one
month
after
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
one
month
after
the
alleged
rape
by
petitioners
three
months
before
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
the
first,
this
is
what
then
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
in
a
few
--
if
i
may
hold
it
until
i
finish
my
account
of
the
evidence
because
i
haven't
concluded
it
i
will
come
to
that
question
justice
black.
she
also
told
wheeler
a
little
more
than
these
circumstances,
she
also
told
wheeler
something
about
her
sex
history
generally.
he
told
him
that
for
the
past
two
years
since
the
time
she
was
14,
she
had
had
intercourse
relations
with
so
many
different
man
and
boys
that
she
didn't
know
how
many
including
many
of
them
who
were
strangers.
joseph
told
them
that
on
numerous
occasions
she
had
engaged
in
oral
settlement.
at
this
point
wheeler
marked
the
case
closed
on
count.
now,
to
get
to
justice
black's
question,
these
episodes
and
these
are
episodes
within
the
first
category
for
purposes
of
the
precedence
and
the
evidentiary
question.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
narrative
account
to
have
four
components.
first
is
that
she
made
a
false
accusation
of
rape
against
somebody
else.
secondly
that
she
attempted
suicide
and
incidentally
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding
and
psychiatrist
testified
that
this
of
the
16-year
old
girl
was
itself
indicative
a
serious
mental
disturbance.
third,
she
was
hospitalized
in
the
psychiatric
ward
and,
fourth
that
she
had
a
sex
history
indicative
of
nymphomania.
now,
the
authorities
numerous
authority
dealing
with
sex
cases
in
various
jurisdictions
hold
even
in
the
abstract
that
any
as
to
each
one
of
these
four
components
that
they
are
admissible
in
evidence
where
there
is
a
defense
of
consent
because
they
are
indicative
of
the
mental
illness
of
the
prosecutor
and
because
they
are
indicative
of
a
well-known
syndrome
which
involves
as
a
characteristic
element,
a
compulsion
on
the
part
of
a
young
girl
to
contrive
sex
offenses
by
men.
mr.
joseph
forer
in
the
law
of
maryland,
nothing
gets
clear
on
the
evidence.
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
majority
said
we
will
assume
that
this
information
could
reasonably
have
been
deemed
admissible
and
useful.
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
case
law
of
maryland
isn't
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
just
not
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
however,
this
--
on
the
one
hand
the
majority
--
at
least
the
court
that
sets
the
law
in
maryland.
majority
said
we're
willing
to
assume
it
would
have
been
admissible.
the
two
judges
in
the
minority
said
we
think
that
it
was
reasonably
admissible
or
a
reasonable
possibility
of
admissibility
and
pointed
out
that
when
you
come
to
the
close
question
with
evidence,
you
can't
tell
whether
it's
admissible
until
you
see
how
it's
produced
when
she
seems
to
me
make
the
most
sense.
the
grounds
on
which
is
often
a
particular
way
the
counsel
works
within
and
so
forth.
and
the
trial
judge
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
also
said
that
he
thought
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
admissibility
and
he
also
said,
he
doesn't
have
to
find
the
least
admissible
in
case
there
were
a
trial.
in
another
ground
of
materiality
here,
is
that
with
this
kind
of
information,
it
seems
to
us
that
defense
could
have
applied
for
and
would
have
received
a
pretrial
mental
examination
of
the
prosecutor.
and
considering
the
evidence
which
we
do
not
claim
to
be
suppressed
but
the
newly
discovered
evidence
in
addition
to
what
i
have
described,
there
is
certainly
a
very
strong
possibility
that
this
mental
examination
would
have
been
adverse
to
the
girl's
credibility.
if
i
may
anticipate
the
next
question,
there
is
no
law
in
maryland
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
or
not
pretrial
mental
examinations
can
be
ordered
in
such
a
situation.
now,
aside
from
the
fact--
mr.
joseph
forer
there
is
law
elsewhere
and
decided
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
there
is
law--
mr.
joseph
forer
if
you
will
look
at
page
31
of
my
--
our
brief
justice
stewart
you
will
see
that
we
cite
some
law
on
that
subject.
we
cited
the
new
jersey
case,
california
case
and
the
south
dakota
case.
and
we
also
explained
what
sanctions
are
available
to
the
court
if
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
take
the
--
such
a
mental
examination.
this
is
the
new
law
and
as
i
say
there
is
no
precedent
in
one
way
or
the
other
in
new
jersey.
but
leaving
aside,
the
question
of
whether
in
maryland
--
mr.
joseph
forer
in
maryland.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
states
should
have
informed
the
defense
of
it.
and
then
by
the
state
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
not
only
an
escapade
that
she
had
made
a
false
accusation
of
rape
against
somebody
else
when
part
of
their
defense
was
that
she
was
making
a
false
accusation
of
rape
against
them.
and
when
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
as
i
narrated,
she
told
her
boyfriend
busty
who
told
her
family,
who
told
the
police,
but
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
when
sergeant
wheeler
talked
to
her,
the
first
thing
that
she
said
to
wheeler,
the
very
first
thing
amounted
to
an
accusation
of
rape
because
she
said
to
wheeler,
these
two
men
had
intercourse
with
me
against
my
will.
it
was
then
when
wheeler
cross-examined
her
that
these
facts
came
out.
she
never
denied
that
she'd
been
raped,
she
just
gave
them
the
facts
which
negatives
is
rape.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
that's
right,
then
no
wonder.
now,
leaving
aside
the
abstract
question
that
this
kind
of
evidence
in
segments
of
it
has
been
held
admissible
in
various
jurisdiction.
this
evidence
has
peculiar
materiality
and
peculiar
relevancy
here
so
that
in
my
view
it
could
have
been
admitted
because
of
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
regardless
of
some
other
technical
obstacle.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
it
well
may
have
been
because
if
they
want
--
mr.
joseph
forer
actually
justice
black,
we
don't
think
you
have
to
go
that
far.
but
to
answer
your
hypothetical
question
because
i
don't
think
that's
involved
here
--
now
it
is
--because
if
the
evidence
would
have
been
admissible
you
don't
have
to
decide
whether
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
if
it's
not
admissible.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
on
the
basis
of
state
law.
now,
if
i
will
go
further,
however,
if
all
these
evidence
were
inadmissible
in
state
law
in
my
opinion,
that
would
be
just
as
much
a
violation
of
due
process
as
it
is
to
convict
the
person
on
the
state
law
without
any
evidence
of
guilt.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
as
far
as
i
go.
if
i
may
say--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
that's
not
correct
either,
it
might
be
because
if
you
--
first,
you
never
can
tell
really
whether
the
evidence
is
admissible
or
not,
but
secondly,
this
may
be
evidence
which
will
lead
them
to
evidence
which
they
can
produce
in
an
admissible
form.
so
the
question
really
isn't
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
now,
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
to
make
the
judgment,
whether
evidence
that
he
has
is
reasonably
exculpatory
and
material
and
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
other
side
might
not
have.
and
the
court
of
maryland,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
held
this
state
law
as
well
as
federal
law
held
that
where
there
is
a
possibility,
a
reasonable
possibility
of
materiality
and
admissibility,
the
prosecutor
has
a
duty
to
inform
either
the
defense
or
the
judge
or
the
jury
of
this
exculpatory
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
just
said
that's
the
law.
they
--
now,
whether
they
were
interpreting
state
law
or
federal
law
and
--
but
i
will
say
that
this
principle
has
been
announced
not
only
by
the
state
of
maryland
but
by
federal
circuits
including
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
griffin
case
which
was
cited
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
that's
certainly
a
law
in
maryland.
but
the
peculiar
relevancy
of
this
testimony
is
that
it
would
have
made
plausible
the
testimony
of
the
petitioners
that
was
otherwise
unbelievable.
it
would
have
made
plausible
that
that
testimony
which
required
the
jury
to
believe
that
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
that
would
have
acted
and
spoken
that
way
that
in
other
words,
she
was
not
just
an
ordinary
child,
but
she
was
the
kind
of
child
that
lillian
helman
wrote
her
famous
play
about.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
coming
to
that
as
my
next
subject
and
if
you
will
just
defer
it,
because
i
would
now
like
to
go
into
my
second
category.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
which
was
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
now,
furthermore
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
prosecution,
i
meant
to
say
that
to
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
forer
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
with
the
information,
the
knowledge
was
--
and
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
the
chief
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
the
knowledge
of
the
state's
attorney
who
was
the
chief
prosecutor
would
personally
drive
the
case.
he
had
the
same
knowledge
incidentally
that
the
--
that
lieutenant
whalen
who
was
the
chief
detective
in-charged
of
the
investigation
then.
so
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
we
have
any
problem
as
to
who
is
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
if
he
were
just
told
that,
i
will
come
to
the
knowledge
aspect
in
just
a
moment
but
i
want
to
correct
one
--
i
want
to
follow
up
one
other
thing.
this
information
wasn't
admissible
merely
to
impeach
joyce's
credibility.
in
my
opinion,
it
was
also
preoperative
a
substantive
evidence
of
their
testimony
that
she
had
said
to
them
in
the
woods,
“i
have
16
or
17
other
boys
this
week
and
two
or
three
more
won't
make
any
difference.”
does
this
testimony
a,
makes
it
entirely
plausible
that
she
did
have
16
or
17
other
boys
that
week
and
b
that
whether
or
not
she
had
it,
she
would
go
around
and
tell
it
to
relative
strangers.
so
it
would
have
corroborated
that.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
second
category
then
i'll
get
to
the
question
of
knowledge
but
i
would
like
to
clean
out
what
the
evidence
that
we're
complaining
about
the
--
you
recall
that
i
said
that
the
petitioners
testified
that
joyce
have
told
them
variously
that
she
was
on
probation
or
in
trouble
and
that
if
she
were
caught
in
the
woods
because
of
this
thing
on
probation
or
in
trouble
she
would
have
to
claim
that
she
was
raped.
now,
there
was
no
corroboration
of
this
testimony
and
the
petitioner's
testimony
to
this
effect
was
ridiculed
by
the
state
and
joyce
denied
that
she
was
on
probation.
now,
as
the
post-conviction
proceeding
showed
at
the
time
of
this
episode
in
the
woods
that
was
pending
against
joyce
a
petition
in
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
alleging
that
she
was
beyond
parental
console
and
a
recommendation
of
a
court
case
worker
that
she
be
put
on
probation.
so
joyce
was
a,
in
trouble
and
b,
although
she
was
not
on
probation
she
was
in
the
status
close
to
it
that
a
lay
person
might
have
described
as
probation.
and
furthermore,
as
the
evidence
of
the
post-conviction
proceeding
showed,
in
fact
she
did
call
it
probation
because
on
the
saturday
before
the
thursday
of
the
alleged
rape
by
the
petitioners,
she
went
out
with
a
boyfriend
of
hers
pat
stevens
and
she
told
pat
stevens
let's
stay
in
laurel.
let's
not
go
down
to
hyattsville
because
i'm
on
probation.
and
in
fact,
she
wasn't
on
probation.
she
was
in
this
near
probation
status.
this
evidence,
the
materiality
of
it
can
possibly
be
controverted
because
it
would
have
corroborated
critical
testimony
of
the
petitioners
which
i
believe
obviously
negatives
rape
and
it
would
have
removed
a
false
impression
created
before
the
jury
by
the
cross-examination
of
the
defendants
and
by
the
state's
witness'
denial
of
being
on
probation.
mr.
joseph
forer
was
not
known,
he
tried
to
find
out
what
there
was
against
her
in
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
and
montgomery's
county
because
he
knew
the
boy's
story
and
he
was
refused
to
access
for
the
record.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
testified
that
he
did
not.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
question
of
the
knowledge.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
just
don't
know.
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
was
i
the
petitioner's
or
if
the
petitioner
did
that.
those
petitions
are
usually
stereotype
mimeographed
sheets.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
they
--
the
judge
--
we
have
subpoenaed
the
records
and
the
judge
wouldn't
let
us
--
judge
moorman
wouldn't
let
us
put
it
in
evidence
and
find
that
we
got
it
in
stipulation.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
could
have
been
produced
by
--
if
the
court
allowed
it
we
had
got
a
written
permission
--
mr.
joseph
forer
both
courts.
we
have
got
a
written
permission
from
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
and
a
ruling
which
i
cannot
to
this
day
understand
and
which
i
cannot
explain
the
basis
for,
judge
moorman
refused
to
introduce
an
evidence
so
then
we
finally
managed
to
get
in
the
key
point
by
means
of
stipulation.
let
me
now
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
prosecution.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
prosecution
consisted
of
the
state's
attorney
and
the
investigating
police.
for
present
purposes,
that
means
party
who
was
the
state's
attorney
and
who
tried
the
case
and
lieutenant
whalen
who
was
the
detective
in-charge
of
the
investigation.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
but
the
only
knowledge
that
--
but
in
fact
all
of
the
knowledge--
mr.
joseph
forer
was
in
this
two.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
the
only
way
we
established
knowledge
was
from
their
own
lips.
now,
kardy
the
state's
attorney
and
whalen
the
head
of
the
detectives
knew
the
evidence
chose
this
and
they
were
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
trial
court
to
know
about
the
attempted
suicide
and
about
the
second
rape
accusation
but
they
knew
them
only
in
a
general
way
and
they
didn't
know
the
details
and
all
the
subsidiary
evidence
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
were
not
interested
and
made
no
effort
to
investigate.
kardy
for
example
testified
that
he
knew
that
he
know
that
joyce
had
taken
this
overdose
of
drugs
and
he
assumed
that
it
was
intentional
and
motivated.
he
happened
to
have
their
motive
but
he
assumed
that
it
was
a
suicide
attempt.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
state's
attorney.
he
also
knew
that
joyce
have
been
involved
in
an
allegation
of
another
rape
and
that
nothing
had
come
of
this
allegation,
not
even
the
produce
formal
charges.
but
he
hadn't
bothered
to
find
out
and
didn't
know
that
the
allegation
was
made
by
joyce
because
he
didn't
bother
to
find
out.
and
the
same
thing
was
true
of
lieutenant
whalen,
the
detective
lieutenant.
although
after
all,
although
he
didn't
know
immediately
that
joyce
had
instigated
the
charge,
he
got
the
information
of
this
second
alleged
rape
from
the
girl's
mother.
and
that
by
itself
should
indicate,
it
seems
to
me
a
definite
possibility
that
the
complaint
originated
with
the
girl.
now
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yeah,
he
got
a
telephone
call
from
the
girl's
mother
and
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yeah,
that's
right.
and
he
said,
don't
bother
me
with
that.
now,
in
short,
they
did
know,
they
know
she
had
taken
this
overdose,
they
assume
that
the
suicide,
they
knew
that
she
was
involved
in
the
second
rape
accusation.
now
if
you
limit,
if
you
limit
the
state's
knowledge
or
the
responsibility
of
the
state
merely
to
what
they
knew
they
actually
knew
without
more,
we
say
that
under
the
authorities
and
under
any
kind
of
reason,
that
was
material
in
and
of
itself.
they
knew
there
was
a
suicide
attempt
or
they
knew
enough
about
it.
they
knew
there
was
a
second
rape
accusation
which
apparently
was
false
and
they
had
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
joyce
have
instigated
it.
and
that
would
be
enough.
but
i
want
to
go
further,
there's
another
grounds
for
materiality
here.
not
only
would
this
evidence
have
been
enough
in
and
out
itself.
but
if
you
assume
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
did
that
there
is
a
duty
to
divulge
anything
that
is
possibly
material
and
that
this
duty
was
breached
here.
once
you
have
a
breach
of
a
duty
to
divulge,
then
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
breach
of
the
duty
was
prejudicial,
you're
past
the
question
of
breach
which
means
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
material.
then
you
should
look,
not
only
at
the
value
of
the
precise
things
known
to
the
prosecution
and
not
divulge
but
also
at
what
the
defense
was
in
all
likelihood
and
in
years
surely
would
have
discovered
if
the
duty
had
not
been
breached.
if
kardy
and
whalen
had
told
the
defense
what
they
knew,
any
diligent
defense
would
have
checked
with
the
police
department
of
prince
george's
county
and
would
have
gotten
the
whole
story
that
lieutenant
wheeler
had
knew
and
would
have
had
everything
else.
and
this
was
a
point
made
by
the
dissenting
opinion.
the
dissenting
opinion
said,
in
order
to
determine
materiality,
first,
what
they
actually
knew
was
itself
material,
but
secondly
that
having
breached
the
duty
of
divulgence
of
disposure
that
this
information
was
material
because
of
--
it
would
have
been
a
great
value
for
the
defense
by
further
investigation.
now,
we
have
an
alternative
theory
for
--
on
the
question
of
knowledge,
this
is
an
alternative
theory
with
regard
to
category
one
of
the
suppressed
evidence
that
is
the
history
of
the
false
rape
accusation
and
the
attempted
suicide.
but
it
is
the
only
theory
that
we
have
with
regard
to
the
nondisclosure
of
the
fact
that
she
was
in
this
near
probation
status.
we
say
that
under
certain
circumstances
for
the
purposes
of
the
suppression
doctrine,
it
is
right
to
charge
the
prosecution,
not
only
with
what
they
actually
knew
but
also
with
constructive
knowledge
of
what
they
should
have
known
if
they
had
conducted
an
unbiased
investigation
and
if
they
had
shown
the
most
rudimentary
diligence
in
the
performance
of
the
obligation
that
they
owe
to
the
state
as
public
officials
and
to
all
accused
to
investigate
allegations
of
crime
with
some
kind
of
elementary
diligence.
and
we
say
here
that
this
duty
to
the
public
was
breached.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
think
that
overstates
my
position
justice
black.
i
say,
well
first
of
all,
the
prosecution
here
did
investigate.
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
they
came
upon
evidence
which
was
indicative
of
innocence.
instead
of
performing
the
duty
to
conduct
an
unbiased
investigation,
they
turned
their
back
on
the
others.
they
deliberately
closed
their
eyes
--
mr.
joseph
forer
are
they
certainly
do.
they
owed
a
duty
to
the
defendants
and
they
owed
a
duty
to
the
public.
and
at
minimum
that
duty
is
not
to
deliberately
close
their
eyes
to
exculpatory
or
possibly
exculpatory
evidence
in
order
that
they
may
then
have
an
excuse
not
to
turn
the
evidence
over
to
the
defense.
now,
all
i
can
say
justice
black
is
that
there
is
a
minimum
of
authority
on
this
point.
this
court
hasn't
spoken
on
that
point.
there
are
a
few
lower
court
cases
which
do
hex
the
prosecution
with
constructive
knowledge
because
it
was
information
which
they
should
have
known.
now,
let
me
rehearse
the
circumstances
here
which
called
upon
them
to
make
some
kind
of
an
investigation.
first,
the
medical
testimony,
it
was
indicative
of
intercourse
but
not
of
forcible
penetration.
you
have
a
16-year
old
girl
alone
in
the
woods
late
at
night
with
a
21-year
old
man,
originally
with
three
men.
she
ran
a
great
distance
of
30
feet
to
escape
being
ravished.
she
was
first
to
offer
sex
to
john
giles.
she
didn't
resist,
she
didn't
expostulate,
it
was
capital
offense,
the
defense
was
indigent,
the
information
was
--
the
indicated
information
to
check
was
readily
available
to
the
prosecution
and
the
police.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
there's
a
little
dirt
path
that
was
right
down
to
the
river
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
about
midnight.
mr.
joseph
forer
who
were
doing?
the
petitioners?
mr.
joseph
forer
they
had
been
fishing
and
swimming
in
the
river.
as
they
came
out
of
the
river
they
had
to
go
past
the
car.
mr.
joseph
forer
drinking,
they
had
some
beer.
yeah
well,
i
think
they
had
had
one
6
--pack
of
beer
for
about
four
people.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
testified
that
when
she
and
john
giles
were
alone
in
the
wood,
that
she
said
to
him
that
she
would
like
to
have
them
to
have
intercourse
with
her
if
he
helped
her
get
away.
this
was
her
own
testimony
and
since
she
never
--
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
what
she
said.
but,
may
i
point
out
that
since
she
never
told
john
giles
that
she
had
a
mental
reservation,
or
that
she
had
changed
her
mind.
the
alleged
rape
by
john
giles
comes
down
to
a
breach
of
contract
for
lack
of
consideration
that
he
didn't
have
to
get
away.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
it
wasn't
a
rape
at
all.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
but
of
course
under
the
law
of
maryland,
the
unchastity
of
a
woman
who
has
been
raped
is
admissible
at
the
conviction
for
the
purpose
of
determining
sentence
but
we're
not
going
into
that
here.
but
if
she
was
raped,
she
was
raped,
our
point
is
that
she
wasn't
raped
and
that
the
state
suppressed
evidence
which
to
any
reasonable
mind
would
have
corroborated
and
made
plausible
the
testimony
of
these
two
young
men
who
otherwise
had
nowhere
else
to
turn.
mr.
joseph
forer
they?
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
now,
let
me
stay
for
a
minute
on
the
policy
consideration.
it
said
well,
this
is
the
past
of
nondisclosure.
the
prosecution
doesn't
have
to
be
the
defense
counsel.
the
prosecution
can't
be
expected
to
disclose
information
available
to
the
defendant.
now,
the
information
here
was
not
available
for
the
defense.
and
the
state
is
in
a
position
where
it
must
disclose.
it
not
only
has
superior
resources
it
has
an
obligation
to
see
that
justice
is
done,
as
all
prosecutors
always
say,
make
luncheon
speeches
but
do
not
necessarily
carry
out.
and
the
state's
nondisclosure
of
exculpatory
evidence
can't
be
excused
even
if
there
is
as
there
was
not
here
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defense.
supposed
both
were
at
fault,
it's
a
different
kind
of
fault,
where
the
fault
is
refusal
to
--
is
a
concealment,
a
withholding
of
the
information
that
you
have,
on
one
side
the
prosecution
side
and
the
fault
on
the
defense
side
is
a
failure
to
acquire
the
information
which
it
could
have
gotten
if
it
had
tried.
where
the
prosecution
fails
to
disclose
information
that
it
has
the
best
you
can
say
for
it
is
that
it
is
deliberately
exploiting
a
mistake
or
negligence
by
the
defense
counsel
in
order
to
try
to
get
his
client
sent
to
the
chair
or
convicted
for
a
long
time.
and
even
if
the
prosecution
isn't
being
malicious
about
it
then
at
least
they
had
the
last
clear
chance
and
tort
terms
and
they
didn't
take
advantage
of
it
nor
is
this
passive
nondisclosure.
the
vice
is
not
the
failure
to
disclose.
the
vice
is
prosecuting
without
failing
to
disclose.
and
there
was
nothing
passive
about
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
and
this
nondisclosure
was
no
more
a
passive
thing
than
a
stationary
part
of
a
moving
machine.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
my
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
don't
--
obviously
the
state
isn't
required
to
disclose
a
trivial
matter.
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
i
haven't
said
a
stage
of
disclose
everything.
now
maybe
in
time
there
will
adopted
the
full
discovery
and
rules
that
justice
brennan
advocated
in
the
speech
he
made
in
the
washington
university.
that's
different,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
cases
where
the
prosecution
has
breached
its
duty
because
it
has
suppressed
something
in
significant.
i
want
to
talk
--
mr.
joseph
forer
of
course
it
is.
mr.
joseph
forer
actually
listed
in
the
word
material.
mr.
joseph
forer
you
mean
the
two
categories?(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
forer
the
point
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
rape,
at
the
time
when
she
was
supposed
to
be
saying
that
she
was
on
probation,
she
was
at
that
very
moment
in
this
status
of
near
probation.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
any
winched
phonological
line,
the
only
question
--
the
only
role
that
chronology
might
have
is
the
effect
the
materiality,
but
once
you
grant
the
information
of
material,
then
it
should
be
disclosed
regardless
of
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
forer
but
the
material
and
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
the
material
for
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
but
it
was
also
a
material
as
affirmative
corroboration
of
the
defendant's
story.
that's
particularly
true
of
the
probation
evidence.
yes
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
in
most
instances,
that's
right
but
i
mean
if
there's
going
to
be
a
disclosure
it
should
be
made
before
the
trial
is
over.
now,
there
may
be
instances
where
the
prosecution
is
justified
in
delaying
disclosure.
but
i
just
don't
see
how
it's
possible
to
say
that
a
prosecutor
can
actively
seek
to
send
people
to
the
chair
as
we
did
here.
in
the
mean
time,
keeping
in
his
back
pocket
all
the
way
to
the
very
end
information
which
was
critical
and
which
might
have
shown
their
innocence.
mr.
joseph
forer
lieutenant
whalen
testified
that
he
did
not
know.
we
thought
he
did.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
but
he
should
have
known.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
believe
me,
if
the
social
status
of
these
people
have
been
different
he
would
have
known
rather
than
--
mr.
joseph
forer
for
instance,
he
said
to
john
giles,
remember
this
was
after
joyce
had
already
denied
she
was
on
probation.
and
john
giles
himself
was
on
probation.
so
he
said,
so
you
went
in
the
woods
and
you
were
on
probation
and
she
was
on
probation
now
what
did
you
two
probationers
talked
about?
and
then
he
kept
talking
about
probation,
probation,
probation,
rubbing
into
the
jury
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
that
she
wasn't
on
probation.
it's
very
much
like
that
alcorta
against
texas
case
in
which
the
state,
they
used
evidence
which
was
literally
true
by
which
because
it
failed
of
being
supplemented
by
additional
evidence
created
a
false
impression
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
guess
if
you
read
the
whole
record,
you
will
that
somewhere
there's
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
prior
criminal
conviction
for
housebreaking.
and
presumably
that
was
his
only
criminal
conviction
presumably
he
was
on
probation
with
that.(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
asked
the
girl,
joyce,
on
redirect
examination.
you
see
the
way
it
came
up
joyce
of
course
testified
before
the
defendant.
the
defense
counsel
in
cross-examining
her,
said
to
her,
“didn't
you
say
to
them
that
you
were
on
probation
and
would
have
to
claim
rape?”
and
she
said,
“no,
i
didn't
say
that.”
then
on
redirect
examination,
the
prosecutor
said
to
her,
“were
you
on
probation
at
that
time?”
and
she
said,
“no.”
then
when
the
petitioners
testified
that
she
had
told
them
she
was
on
probation,
then
on
cross-examination
of
the
petitioners
and
we
give
the
references
in
our
brief,
he
ridiculed
that
testimony.
whatever
term
i
have
left,
i
will
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
stipulation
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
episode
in
the
woods
that
was
pending
in
the
juvenile
court
of
prince
george's
county
a
petition
for
her
commitment
and
in
connection
with
that
petition
that
was
pending
a
recommendation
by
the
court's
case
worker
that
joyce
be
put
on
probation.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yeah.
mr.
joseph
forer
yeah,
but
there
was
a
reason
for
that.
what
happened
was
that
the
montgomery
county
police
took
joyce
and
had
her
committed
to
the
--
to
an
institution
--had
her
committed
to
a
school
the
montrose
school
during
prior
to
and
during
the
trial.
by
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
and
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
then
later
after
accepting
jurisdiction
bring
her
in
this
institution
temporarily
until
after
she
had
testified
then
discharged
her
on
the
grounds
that
they
didn't
have
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
forer
basis
of
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
basis
of
her
commitment
was
a
petition
brought
by
or
instigated
by
lieutenant
whalen
in
which
--
would
you
give
me
a
moment
--
if
you
will
look
on
page
275
of
the
record,
there
is
the
proceeding
in
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
now
if
you
look
at
the
case
hearing
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
this
hearing
was
held
the
same
day
she
got
out
of
the
hospital
august
5.
mr.
joseph
forer
september
5,
same
day
she
got
out
of
the
hospital
after
the
suicide
attempt.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes,
and
the
testimony
of
the
post-conviction
proceeding
of
lieutenant
whalen
was
that
he
would
arrange
this
hearing
in
montgomery
county.
if
you'll
look
at
the
very
top
it
says
joyce
roberts
and
it
gives
her
address
at
hyattsville,
maryland
which
everybody
knows
is
in
prince
george's
county.
if
you
look
at
--
on
page
277
you'll
see
that
on
april
30th,
the
case
was
closed
on
the
grounds
that
she
is
no
longer
residing
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
although
everybody
knew
that
she
was
not
residing
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
begin
with.
and
what
happened
here
was
that
while
she
was
--
before
this
case
was
dismissed
in
prince
george's
county
the
charge
against
her
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
jurisdiction
had
been
taken
by
montgomery
county.
so,
that's
why
nothing
ever
came
of
the
case
in
prince
george's
county.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
was
not
actually
on
probation,
she
was
in
trouble
which
is
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence
and
she
was
in
a
status
where
she
could
describe
this
probation
and
did.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
wasn't
but
she
referred
to
it
is
probation
and
the
important
thing
was
what
she
was
saying
when
she
said
that
she
was
on
probation
and
she
certainly
was
in
trouble.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
certainly
are.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
are
not
only
willing,
they
have
insisted.
let
me
first
answer
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised.
there
was
no,
no
pre-sentence
investigation
in
this
case.
the
judge
could
have
ordered
one,
he
did
fail
to
order
one.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
do
know
--
mr.
joseph
forer
not
only
do
i
know
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
within
the
--
in
the
five-day
interval
that
conducted
such
an
investigation.
i
do
know
there
was
none.
secondly,
there
was
no
pre-sentence
investigation
between
verdict
and
sentence.
the
judge
just
in
order
and
there
was
not
and
he
sentenced
him
to
death
without
pre-sentence
investigation
and
after
a
five-minute
hearing
in
which
the
only
thing
that
was
offered
was
some
reputation
testimony
by
one
person
which
is
in
the
record.
secondly,
on
the
question
of
sentencing,
there
is
--
we
would
not
be
satisfied
to
have
a
case
where
a
portion
of
the
law
i'll
say
that
right
now.
but
it
is
true
and
this
is
relevant
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
fourth
circuit
case
construing
maryland
law
in
the
advanced
sheets.
it's
not
in
neither
brief.
whitaker
against
the
warden
362
federal
second
838,
362
f.2d
838
which
construing
maryland
law
on
the
question
of
sentence
says
that
it
is
unquestionably
clear
that
the
promiscuity
of
a
rape
victim
would
be
admissible
in
mitigation
of
sentence.
i
want
to
--
on
the
question
of
petitioner's
exhibit
3
--
mr.
joseph
forer
838,
362
federal
second
838
of
the
advanced
sheet.
on
the
question
of
petitioner's
exhibit
3
which
is
the
montgomery
county
juvenile
court
hearing.
i
just
don't
understand
our
counsel
can
say
we
didn't
offer
it.
it's
right
there
in
the
record
at
page
173
of
the
record
we
offered
it.
the
state
objected
and
the
judge
moorman
excluded
it
on
the
state's
objection.
why
he
did
it,
i
can't
understand.
if
you
want
to
see
the
discussion
that
went
on
the
full
evidentiary
transcript
which
is
in
the
certified
record.
mr.
joseph
forer
whatever,
we
have
a
very
rough
time
at
the
post-conviction
proceeding
getting
any
evidence
in.
mr.
joseph
forer
were
frustrated.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
including
testimony
on
the
records.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
what
happened
was
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
it
was
more
than
that.
he
admitted
being
at
the
hearing.
he
showed
a
very
weak
memory
to
the
point
where
he
couldn't
even
remember
things
that
the
hearing
folks
are
saying.
but
he
did
say
that
on
--
he
wasn't
at
the
hearing
at
all
times.
he
said
he
went
in
and
out
a
couple
of
times.
that's
the
gravamen
of
his
testimony.
he
was
at
the
hearing
but
he
said
that
he
didn't
remember
some
of
it
and
he
wasn't
in
the
hearing
every
minute
of
the
hearing.
on
the
question
of
what
transpired
at
the
car,
the
version
given
by
mr.
needle
seems
to
me
to
be
an
inaccurate
account
of
the
state's
evidence.
it
certainly
does
not
correspond
to
the
contrary
evidence
of
the
defense.
furthermore,
among
the
new
evidence
that
we
sought
to
get
a
hearing
on
was
a
great
mass
of
evidence
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
we
claim
suppressed
including
evidence
relating
to
stewart
foster
and
the
accounts
given
by
stewart
foster
after
--
immediately
after
this
alleged
rape
which
would
have
served
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
the
defendants
that
they
would
not
the
aggressors.
they
did
not
provoke
the
altercation
and
we
were
never
able
to
get
that
new
evidence
in
because
of
the
maryland
three-day
rule.
now,
we're
not
claiming
that
the
evident
information
that
was
suppressed
proves
innocence.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
information
was
of
a
quality
that
the
defense
should
have
had
the
opportunity
to
present
that
or
the
fruits
of
the
information
to
the
jury.
and
it
wasn't
up
to
the
prosecutor
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
evidence
should
be
given
to
was
at
least
he
could
have
done
was
leave
it
to
the
judge
as
to
whether
the
jury
should
pass
on
it.
and
now,
at
this
late
date,
the
court
of
appeals
says
he
probably
breached
his
obligation
but
the
evidence
wasn't
sufficiently
exculpatory
and
in
that
respect,
the
court
of
appeals
is
invading
the
providence
of
the
jury
which
in
maryland
law
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
exculpatory
value
of
admissible
evidence
and
in
that
respect,
we
were
denied
equal
protection
under
all
the
opinions
in
the
brady
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
have
about
three
minutes
on
the
question
of
the
admissibility?
mr.
needle
also
states
the
maryland
law
very
seriously
when
he
says
that
there
would
not
be
admissible
under
maryland
law
the
fact
of
a
prior
false
rape
claim.
in
smallwood
versus
warden
which
was
a
case
by
the
federal
district
court
of
maryland
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
chief
judge
thompson
granted
habeas
corpus
because
of
a
suppression
of
a
prior
rape
accusation
where
there
wasn't
even
evidence
that
it
was
false.
in
this
case,
neither
the
majority
nor
the
minority
adopted
his
theory
that
this
evidence
is
clearly
been
held
inadmissible.
they
said
it
might
well
have
been
admissible
and
we've
all
--
but
we
don't
pass
on
it
in
this
content.
now,
what
he
is
talking
about
is
the
case
of
rau
against
the
state
which
was
decided
in
1919
which
was
a
statutory
rape
case
in
which
the
evidence
that
the
child
involved
had
made
a
prior
accusation
was
offered
solely
on
the
theory
that
it
impugned
the
character
of
the
girl.
at
this
time,
because
there
was
so
little
knowledge
of
psychiatry,
it
wasn't
offered
on
the
theory
for
which
it
is
now
considered
admissible,
namely
the
theory
of
showing
either
mental
illness
or
mental
bias,
a
kind
of
corrupt
bias
against
the
class
of
people
namely
men
of
whom
the
accused
are
members.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
1919
well
this
kind
of
evidence
is
not
admissible
as
going
to
character
because
we
don't
care
about
character.
but
that
is
why
neither
smallwood
against
the
warden
nor
the
majority
here
said
this
means
that
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
for
other
purposes.
for
other
purposes
it
is
clearly
admissible.
of
those
grounds,
i
want
to
thank
the
