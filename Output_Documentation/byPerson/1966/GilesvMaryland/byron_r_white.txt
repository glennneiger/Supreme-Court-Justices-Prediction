[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
know
the
trial
judge
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
pursue
that
the
matter
in
september
5
hearing
that
this
would
clear
my
own
mind
that
lieutenant
whalen
was
at
that
hearing,
in
the
juvenile
court
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
he
had
no
recollection
of
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
in
direct
contrary
of
what
the
record
but
the
discovering
of
the
giles?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
formal
record
at
page
275
of
the
record
it
says
that
those
(inaudible)
detective
whalen.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
over
it
and
then
summarizes
the
hearing.
page
277
it
says
lieutenant
whalen
stated
that
dr.
connor
of
hospital
of
montgomery
(inaudible).
now
the
inference
to
the
written
record
was
ever
introduced
from
the
post-conviction
hearing
i
gather
that
whalen
was
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
for
and
i
noticed
that
before
whalen
have
been
invited
to
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
the
probation
officer,
the
juvenile
court
probation
officer
lynn
adams
and
lynn
adams
was
at
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
what
went
on
at
the
hearing?
who
said
what
to
whom?
there
was
objection,
objection
was
sustained.
the
object
i
suppose
to
the
question
was
to
show
that
lieutenant
whalen
who
was
there
or
to
find
out
if
he
was
there,
he
was
there
what
kind
of
information
he
obtained
at
that
hearing?
and
if
the
juvenile
court
officer
lynn
adams
has
made
an
investigation
a
part
of
this
hearing
which
the
record
shows
that
she
had,
you
would
think
that
there
might
have
been
a
lack
to
disclose
to
the
hearing
other
than
just
give
the
through
summaries
that
are
(voice
overlap).
now,
what
was
the
basis
do
you
know
for
the
exclusion
of
that
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
it
would
be
rather
relevant
thing
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
lieutenant
whalen
might
have
learned
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
have
obligated
the
prosecuting
the
attorney
to
dispose
the
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
was
that
the
cost
of
the
--
that
evidence
was
excluded.
was
that
objection
preserved?
is
that
one
of
the
issues
that
was
taken
to
the
maryland
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
question
that
was
asked
at
that
time
lieutenant
whalen
added
was
precisely
on
the
issue
we've
been
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
all
these
information
about
the
prosecuting
witness
did
all
these
information
come
out
of
that
hearing
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
deal
in
the
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
never
gave
it.
as
i
understand
it
they
did
not
do
it.
they
did
not
provide
verbatim
transcript
to
the
juvenile
court
hearing.
they
are
in
a
very
good
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
the
only
record,
the
actually
the
only
record
in
that
hearing
that
took
place
in
september
5th
is
this
summary?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel
for
the
petitioner
said
that
the
lady
was
the
first
who
brought
up
the
topic
of
sex
and
then
the
defendant
i
heard
the
(inaudible).
do
you
agree
that
he
brought
up
the
topic
of
sex
first
or
invited
the
sexual
intercourse?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
talking
about
her
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
from
--
that's
from
the
language
though.
could
you
give
me
that
language
that
you're
relying
on
there,
plus
what
the
record
stated?
is
it
on
page
55
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gathered
that
all

was

including
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
counsel
for
the
state
suggested
that
the
lieutenant
denied.
the
lieutenant
denied
being
at
the
hearing,
as
i
read
the
record,
he
admitted
that
he
was
at
some
hearing
but
he
can't
remember
what
the
date
was.
justice
byron

he
couldn't

what
went
on

he
was
at.
