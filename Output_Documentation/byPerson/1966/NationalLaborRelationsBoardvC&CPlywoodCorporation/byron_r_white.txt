justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
company
ever
claimed
that
this
action
would
not
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
even
if
there
had
been
no
premium
pay
provision
on
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
would
be
the
government's
position
if
these
two
parties
in
fact
really
agreed
to
permit
the
government
or
permit
the
employer
to
raise
wages
whenever
he
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can't
be
that
the
union
agreed
in
advance
to
let
them
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
this
particular
case,
if
a
court
or
this
court
found
that
this
factual
provision
justified
the
plan
that
the
employer
--
covered
the
plan,
that
the
employer
actually
put
in,
would
the
government
--
is
that
in
the
case
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
that's
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
issue
that's
here
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
but
let's
assume
that
they
do
have
the
authority
and
they
did
it
wrong
and
that
the
contract
doesn't
mean
what
the
board
said
it
means
and
that
the
contract
really
permits
this
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
the
board's
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
--
that's
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
speaking
of
the
employer
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
employer
said
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can't
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
happened
after
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
talked
about
it
in
smith,
didn't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
friedman,
to
the
extent
that
you
feel
that
the
contract
interpretation
issue
where
unfair
labor
practice
really
invokes
the
expertise
of
the
board.
i
would
think
that
--
then
you're
almost
saying
that
the
board's
interpretation
is
pretty
close
to
final
and
that
the
court
shouldn't
to
disturb
it.
and
also
i
would
think
that
the
--
if
somebody
happen
to
come
into
a
301
suits.
let's
assume
the
employer
sued
on
the
provision
and
the
labor
union
said,
“no,
you
can't
sue
at
all.
you'd
better
go
to
the
board.
this
is
one
of
those
things
where
the
board's
expertise
is
critical.”
at
least
they'd
say
that
if
it's
critical
or
you
say
it
is,
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
there
be
a
primary
jurisdiction
then
in
301
suits
where
the
contract
division
overlaps
an
unfair
labor
practice
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
congress
doesn't
--
must
not
feel
a
labor
expertise
is
so
critical.
justice
byron
r.
white
contracts?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
different
question.
we're
not
talking
about
the
board's
authority.
we're
talking
about
the
effect
of
the
board's
action
in
interpreting
contract
whether
how
much
deference
you
must
pay
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
saying
that
if
you
do,
if
that's
the
government's
position,
you
really
should
say
that
smith
against
evening
news
association
should
be
overruled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
and
i
know
--
i
just
don't
understand
how
your
position
here
is
consistent
with
the
position
you
took
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
remember,
we're
not
talking
about
the
questions
of
power.
either
the
--
under
301,
under
the
board's
authority
or
either
one
can
--
i
mean
the
board
can
go
ahead
and
take
of
its
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
court
can
give
a
remedy
for
breach
of
contract
in
the
301.
but
the
real
question
is,
if
the
board
is
so
expertise
that
its
opinion
should
overwrite
that
of
court.
and
the
court,
the
court
gives
a
remedy
on
301
and
other
referent
to
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
the
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
union
sort
of
--
you
think
the
union
--
let's
just
assume
the
union
hadn't
gone
to
the
board
but
it's
on
the
court
sued
under
301,
for
breach
of
contract
to
enforce
a
contract.
now
if
you
think
the
board's
opinion
is
so
critical,
i
would
have
think
the
employer
could
have
send
one
out,
let's
just
hold
up
that
the
court
will
give
the
opinion
on
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
the
union
in
court
in
this
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
would
be
planning
although
--
the
employer
violated
the
agreement
by
paying
too
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
couldn't
get
damages
i
don't
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
the
--
so
is
this
really
very
effective
remedy
going
to
the
court
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
can't
get
anything,
but
you
got
to
go.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
so
the
court
will
say
after
the
court
agreed
with
the
--
agreed
with
the
union.
then
i
supposed
it's
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
that's
been
inherent
in
making
a
contract
as
people
starting
making
contract
except
that
--
instead
of
running
to
a
board,
they
come
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
call
that
compulsory
arbitration,
with
some
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tichy
what
would
be
your
position
if
there's
an
arbitration
clause
in
this
contract,
was
it
broad
enough
to
cover
this
kind
of
--
that
precisely
at
this
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
court
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
company
ever
claimed
that
this
action
would
not
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
even
if
there
had
been
no
premium
pay
provision
on
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
would
be
the
government's
position
if
these
two
parties
in
fact
really
agreed
to
permit
the
government
or
permit
the
employer
to
raise
wages
whenever
he
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can't
be
that
the

i

that's
my
question.
justice
byron

speaking
of
the
