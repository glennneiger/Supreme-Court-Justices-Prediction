justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
how
would
you
state
the
principle
for
which
your
contending
here
that
is
to
say
you've
told
us
that
you
don't
contend
that
the
board
has
general
power
to
interpret
collective
bargaining
agreements.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
other
hand,
the
board
does
have
the
power
with
respect
to
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
how
do
you
--
how
would
you
formulate
a
bridge
between
those
two
principles?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
you
can
add
to
that
assuming
always
that
the
mere
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
find
now
whether
the
board
has
power
in
the
particular
circumstances
to
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
you've
got
to
find
out
--
you've
got
to
go
to
the
end
of
the
process
and
say,
“how
did
it
interpret
it
for
a
work
purpose
and
with
work
consequences?”
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
tichy
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
i
mean
two
questions.
suppose
this
contract
did
not
have
under
such
provision
in
it,
with
respect
to
the
employer's
right
increase
in
wages,
and
suppose
the
employer
did
what
it
did
in
this
case,
would
the
--
would
the
board
have
jurisdiction
that
adjudicated
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
--
i'm
very
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
understand
it.
could
you
answer
me
briefly.
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
want
a
brief
answer
to
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
the
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
justice
abe
fortas
come
on
let's
get
back
to
my
question,
just
very
simply.
let's
suppose
there
were
no
contract
provision
here,
such
as
you're
relying
on
that
is
to
say
no
provision
enabling
the
employer
to
increase
wage
rates
for
an
individual
or
a
group.
is
that
much
of
my
question
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
employer
did
precisely
what
your
client
did
in
this
case.
is
that
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
now
my
question
to
you
is
this.
on
your
theory,
when
the
board,
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
complaint
filed
by
the
union
charging
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
say
that
even
there,
so
you
don't
depend
upon
the
existence
of
the
contract
provision?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i'm
not
asking
whether
it
exist,
i'm
asking
whether
the
board
would
have
jurisdiction.
and
what
you're
telling
me
now
is
that
even
though
the
--
i
would
assume
that
the
situation
and
that
put
to
you,
it
would
not
turn
upon
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
so
your
theory
is
that
once
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
been
entered
into
that
--
whatever
the
employer
does
with
respect
to
wages
cannot
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
well
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
that
you
are
saying
is
that
once
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
been
reached,
an
employer
has
the
right
to
change
to
increase
wages
and
a
no
circumstances
where
the
board
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
complaint
at
the
particular
increase
in
wages
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
how
would
you
state
the
principle
for
which
your
contending
here
that
is
to

justice

fortas
on
the
other

the
board

the
power

now,
how
do
you

how

i
