mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
irrespective
of
how
it
is
said,
the
issue
here
is
a
very
simple
one.
that
issue
is,
does
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
the
right
and
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
it
sole
and
only
basis
for
doing
so
is
to
interpret
and
construe
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
parties?
we
are
convinced
it
does
not
have
that
right.
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
the
pertinent
provision
of
the
contract
upon
which
the
employer
relied
throughout
these
proceedings.
namely,
the
contract
after
setting
forth
a
classified
wage
scale
went
on
and
stated,
“to
the
employer
reserves
the
right
to
pay
a
premium
pay
over
and
above
the
contractual
classified
wage
rate
--
excuse
me,
to
reward
any
particular
employee
for
some
especial
skill,
fitness
skill
aptitude
and
the
like.”
this
is
the
provision
of
the
contract
upon
which
the
employer
relied
and
upon
which
the
board
placed
its
most
unusual
interpretation.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
think
not,
and
to
this
point
if
i
may
have
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
the
board
argument
inherently
implies
that
all
matter
is
not
agreed
upon
in
bargaining,
remain
subject
to
bargaining
before
a
change
is
permitted.
we
do
not
subscribe
to
that
argument.
we
believe
that
this
--
as
this
court
stated
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
decision,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
more
than
a
contract.
it
is
a
generalized
“to
govern
a
myriad
of
cases,
which
the
draftsman
cannot
wholly
anticipate.”
to
continue
this
court
through
justice
douglas
stated,
“collective
bargaining
agreements
regulate
or
restrict
the
exercise
of
management
functions.
they
do
not
oust
management
from
the
performance
of
them.
management
hires
and
fires,
pays
and
promotes,
supervises
and
plans,
all
of
these
are
a
part
of
its
function.
and
absent
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
may
be
exercised
freely
as
limited
by
public
law
and
by
the
willingness
of
employees
to
work
under
the
particular
unilaterally
imposed
conditions.
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
treat
only
with
certain
specific
practices
leaving
the
rest
to
management,
but
subject
to
the
possibility
of
a
work
stoppage
or
work
stoppages”
and
that
conclude
the
quote.
it
is
our
view
that
this
residual
management
rights
are
totally
ignored
in
the
board's
concept
that's
presented
here.
this
concept
also
is
overwhelmingly
accepted
by
the
labor
arbitrators
in
the
labor
arbitration
practice.
the
american
bar
association
labor
relation
section
devoted
a
part
three
as
i
recall
of
its
discussion
on
labor
arbitration
to
this
very
point.
while
there
was
an
effective,
but
i
would
say
a
minority
dissent,
it
is
clear
that
the
large
bulk
of
the
section
and
the
--
those
on
the
committee
and
of
arbitrators
do
feel
that
these
residual
rights
do
exist
just
as
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
this
case.
did
i
answer
your
question
sir?
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
the
board's
authority
is
statutory.
without
the
statute,
there
is
no
board.
the
authority
given
the
board
under
that
statute
while
broad
is
not
limitless.
here,
the
board
seeks
to
exercise
the
authority
to
administer
and
interpret
a
labor
contract
under
a
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice.
yet
neither
the
language
of
the
statute
nor
the
legislative
history
authorizes
this.
the
language
of
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
was
the
same
in
the
original
wagner
act
passed
in
1935
as
it
is
now.
in
1946
and
1947,
congress
was
very
concerned
with
the
usurpation
of
authority
by
the
board
under
this
particular
provision.
and
we
add
at
no
time
in
that
period,
prior
to
1946
and
1947,
had
the
board
gone
as
far
as
it
has
gone
in
this
case.
attention
is
directed
to
the
respondents
brief
at
page
38,
footnote
21.
there,
we
have
a
very
cryptic
analysis
of
the
house
committee
on
education
and
labor
in
which
that
committee
pointed
out,
“unless
congress
rights
into
the
law
guides
for
the
board
to
follow,
the
board
may
attempt
to
carry
this
process
still
further
to
seek
to
control
more
and
more
of
the
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.”
as
a
consequence,
congress
did
not
leave
it
to
the
board
to
make
this
determination
and
in
section
8(d)
chose
to
define
the
terms
to
bargain
collectively.
in
doing
so,
it
is
our
belief
that
what
congress
sought
to
do
was
to
create
an
atmosphere
under
which
collective
bargaining
could
thrive,
not
to
determine
the
terms
of
the
agreement
itself.
the
clause
or
the
section
itself
points
out
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
should
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession.
congress
also
went
out
--
went
on
at
great
lengths
to
spell
out
the
rights
and
the
duties
involved.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
shows
that
the
senate
in
1947,
in
the
bill
it
passed
provided
that
the
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
when
the
bill
got
into
conference,
the
house
is
not
having
a
comparable
provision
prevailed
and
that
portion
of
the
legislation
was
dropped.
it
is
clear
that
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
intended
to
encompass
contract
administration
as
is
further
evidenced
by
the
remarks
of
the
manager
of
the
senate
conferees,
the
late
senator
robert
taft
which
is
quoted
in
our
respondents
brief
at
pages
49
and
50.
he
knows
it
that
while
the
senate
conferees
yielded
on
the
elimination
of
the
violation
of
contract,
unfair
labor
practice.
they
retained
their
other
amendment
which
was
new
to
the
act
namely
section
301,
which
authorizes
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
labor
contract
controversy.
he
concluded,
“if
both
provisions
had
remained,”
that
is
both
the
violation
of
contract
unfair
labor
practice
and
section
301,
“there
would
have
been
a
probable
conflict
of
remedies
and
decisions.”
that
is
--
thus,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
concede
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
remedies
and
decisions
by
leaving
in
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice,
at
the
same
time
that
section
301
was
enacted.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
response
to
the
other
justices'
question,
this
was
the
point
i
was
hoping
that
i
had
covered
and
i'm
happy
that
you
ask
the
question
because
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
no,
no.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
find
that
my
communication
sometimes
is
not
good
and
i'm
glad
that
you
have
asked
the
question.
the
concept
as
we
view
it
is
that
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well
management
has
the
right
--
no,
there
shouldn't
have
been
unfair
labor
practice,
i
apologize.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
say
the
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction
unless,
in
the
course
of
this
situation,
the
employer
had
engaged
in
other
aspects
common
to
unfair
labor
practices,
anti-unanimous,
bad
faith
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
say
not.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
under
the
warrior
&
gulf
decision.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
this
case,
i
depend
upon
it
because
i
feel
that
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
facts
but
i
believe
stepping
one
side
--
one
step
away
from
this
case
in
response
to
your
question.
no,
i
don't
believe
unfair
labor
practice
exists
in
that.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
and
this
is
where
i
believe
is
warrior
&
gulf
decision
applies,
that
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
because
all
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
seeks
to
do
is
to
govern
management.
that
is
one
of
the
elements,
substantial
elements.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no.
we
can
find
alternates
to
that
where
the
necessity
to
bargain
i
think
would
be
a
part
of
it.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
a
new
job,
one
that
had
never
existed
before,
for
which
no
rate
had
been
set
or
negotiated.
i
believe
that
there
--
the
employer
has
the
responsibility
of
negotiating
the
rate
of
that
job
with
the
union.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
wouldn't
like
to
say
under
no
circumstances.
but
at
the
moment,
i
would
say
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
they
would
not
have
that
right
as
i
view
the
present
posture
of
the
labor
law
although
i
acknowledge
the
fact
that
there
is
a
dissent
to
that
view.
finally,
the
conference
report
of
which
was
the
outgrowth
of
the
senate
and
the
house
deliberations
in
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
conclusively
buttresses
the
respondent's
contention
here
when
it
concludes
with
this
language
and
“once
party's
have
made
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
should
be
left
to
the
usual
process
of
the
law.”
and
i
would
like
to
add
because
i
feel
that
this
is
an
essential
and
a
very
important
part
of
this
quote.
they
continued,
“and
not
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.”
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
board
should
have
the
right
to
interpret
construe
and
force
or
administer
labor
contract
either
indirectly
or
directly
is
also
evidenced
by
the
fact
the
73rd
congress
in
1934,
the
congress
immediately
preceding
the
74th
which
in
1935
passed
the
wagner
act,
amended
the
railway
labor
act
establishing
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
in
that
legislation,
congress
spelled
out
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
was
to
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
the
speech
between
employees,
unions
and
carriers
growing
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
railroad
labor
agreements.
if
congress
had
intended
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
surely
involve
itself
in
the
administration
of
labor
contract,
it
certainly
had
the
skill
and
the
precedent
on
how
to
write
such
a
statute.
since
congress
did
not
choose
to
apply
even
remotely
the
language
used
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
is
conclusive
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
should
exercise
the
authority
that
it
search
here.
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
has
been
stated
in
the
same
language
from
the
inception
of
this
legislation.
yet,
in
well
over
25
years,
through
ever
changing
personnel
of
different
political
motivations,
no
effort
was
made
by
the
board
to
assert
itself
in
a
situation
such
as
this
until
1964.
and
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
all
circuits
to
date,
so
far
as
i
can
find,
are
in
complete
harmony
with
the
viewpoint
that
prevailed
in
the
board
prior
to
1964.
there
can
be
no
question.
the
employer's
conduct
here
was
in
complete
good
faith.
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
of
anti-unionanimous.
the
interpretation
made
by
the
employer
was
reasonable
and
a
study
of
the
situation
involved
will
show
that
it
was
completely
proper
and
tenable.
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
union
was
entitled
to
relive,
it
had
many
alternates
that
is
available
to
it.
one,
it
could
have
gone
to
a
federal
part
under
301.
it
could
have
gone
secondly
under
--
to
the
state
court
for
a
contract
violation
on
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
each
position
would
be
that
the
company
violated
the
provision
--
provisions
of
its
contract.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
correct.
that's
correct.
it
would
say
that
the
employer
exercised
in
authority
that
it
did
not
have
under
the
contract.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
don't
see
what
the
element
of
damages
would
be
unless
of
course
the
--
there
would
be
some
inference
here
that
the
union's
integrity
and
reputation
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
say
yes.
i've
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
it
would
at
least
settle
this
question
as
it
would
appear
congress
intended
that
the
party
should
settle
disputes
between
them
over
contract
interpretations.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
would
assume
that
either
specific
performance
or
an
injunction
might
lie,
which
would
get
the
result
that
they
would
be
--
which
the
union
would
be
seeking.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
actually,
it
is
our
belief
that
sec
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that's
correct.
however
into
the
wag
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
provided
an
unfair
labor
practice
exist.
in
other
words,
the
board's
powers
are
very
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
and
of
course
we're
--
our
argument
here
is
that
no
unfair
labor
practice
does
exist.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no
the
board
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
it
con't
--
yes.
it
--
but
you
say
such
as
this
and
this
is
where
unfortunately,
i
must
part
company.
the
10(a)
is
explicit
in
give
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
true,
however
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
because
the
board
must
first
as
a
threshold
matter
interpret
the
contract
and
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
the
clear
intent
of
congress.
that
this
was
not
what
congress
contemplated
the
board
should
engage
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
is
also
complete
or
replete
with
the
concept
of
the
congress
did
want
compulsory
arbitration.
and
actually
as
i
see
this
case,
assuming
that
the
court
should
unfortunately
decided
against
me,
we've
made
one
gigantic
step
off
into
compulsory
arbitration.
why?
because
every
contract
contains
in
one
form
or
another,
some
control
over
a
management
right
or
even
a
union
right
so
that
a
brief
party
can
run
to
the
board.
the
board
makes
an
interpretation
and
here
we
have
our
--
a
compulsory
arbitration
and
as
you
observe
in
this,
our
own
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
accepting
that
it
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
a
sense
it
is,
excepting
that
here,
the
statutory
intent
was
that
the
board
should
not
engage
in
this
activity.
but
it
should
go
to
a
court.
we
get
to
this
matter
of
the
board
expertise
and
it's
clear
that
congress
in
1947
didn't
believe
that
this
expertise
existed.
and
we
also
get
to
the
case
of
dowd
box
company
versus
courtney
in
which
this
court
articulated
which
the
principles
i
believe
that
are
applicable
in
this
case.
at
page
513
of
that
case,
the
court
clearly
delineated
the
authority
of
the
board.
it
was
pointed
out
that
while
congress
confided
primarily
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statutory
rules
to
the
board,
it
rejected
that
policy
with
respect
to
violations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
instead,
the
court
concluded
and
i
“congress
deliberately
chose
to
lead
the
enforcement
of
collective
agreement
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.”
the
other
alternatives
that
were
available
to
the
union
as
i
view
it,
although
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
which
one
of
thee
you
may
believe
to
be
a
more
effective
than
another,
they
could
have
gone
to
state
court
as
the
second
alternative.
the
third
alternative,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
sought
their
intervention
in
this
matter.
and
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service,
i
might
say
from
personal
experience
is
a
very
effective
organization.
they
could
have
sought
as
the
fourth
alternative,
the
state
mediation
facilities.
the
fifth
matter
which
is
not
formed
to
a
timber
products
industry
of
the
great
northwest
is
arbitration
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
sixth,
they
could
have
press
their
point
further
in
collective
bargaining
under
the
grievance
procedure.
or
lastly
as
i
viewed
this
matter,
they
could
have
waited
to
the
next
or
to
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
contract.
and
said
now,
“looking
here
mr.
employer,
we
didn't
like
mean
what
we
said
back
there
and
requested
the
appropriate
revision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
we
would
have
believed
that
the
arbitration
clause
should
have
been
pursued
and
this
matter
submitted
to
an
arbitration
board.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
no
court
action
under
your
trilogy,
yes.
no
court
action,
i
should
have
thought.
the
board
argument
runs
that
it
is
entitled
to
construe
the
provisions
of
a
labor
contract
when
such
construction
is
necessary
to
vindicate
statutory
unfair
labor
practices
when
we
realized
that
almost
every
provision
of
a
labor
contract
in
one
sense
or
another
governs,
wages
outs
in
working
conditions,
we
can
see
that
the
board
can
reason
its
way
into
almost
every
dispute
over
an
interpretation
of
a
contract.
it
can
weigh
the
respective
interpretations
and
if
the
construction
that
it
chooses,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
then
in
their
opinion
then
they
can
find
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
exists.
as
we
view
it
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
some
appropriate
statistics,
the
board
claims
it
is
overburdened
now.
its
trial
examiners
admit
that
it
is
overburdened
now.
to
open
wide
the
doors
that
this
case
would
open
wide
simply
would
add
to
the
burden
of
the
board.
one
last
point,
we
also
feel
that
industrial
stability
will
result
from
the
board's
unwarranted
invasion
of
contract
administration.
the
board
is
now
saying
that
an
employer's
action
which
if
the
board
determines,
he's
not
allowed
by
a
labor
agreement.
that
is
a
contract
violation.
constitutes
an
8
(a)(5)
or
a
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
ma
--
in
the
mastro
plastics
case
this
court
held
at
most
“no
strike”
clauses
do
not
bar
a
strike
which
is
occasioned
by
an
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.
any
claim
of
violation,
employer
violation
of
a
labor
agreement,
that
is
any
grievance,
may
thus
justify
the
union
to
legally
strike
in
spite
of
a
no
strike
clause.
this,
we
believe,
will
only
create
chaos
not
stability
in
the
--
american
industrial
scene.
to
permit
the
bar
to
interpret
contracts
under
circumstances
such
as
exists
here,
clearly
circumvents
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
manifest
congressional
intent.
the
board
should
not
be
permitted
to
indirectly
accomplish
a
purpose
which
has
no
direct
authorization
in
the
act.
to
grant
the
board
request,
we
believe,
is
tantamount
to
poisoning
compulsory
arbitration
upon
american
industry
when
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
it
did
not
approved
of
compulsory
arbitration
of
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
matter
was
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
irrespective
of
how
it
is
said,
the
issue
here
is
a
very
simple
one.
that
issue
is,
does
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
the
right
and
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
it
sole
and
only
basis
for
doing
so
is
to
interpret
and
construe
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
parties?
we
are
convinced
it
does
not
have
that
right.
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
the
pertinent
provision
of
the
contract
upon
which
the
employer
relied
throughout
these
proceedings.
namely,
the
contract
after
setting
forth
a
classified
wage
scale
went
on
and
stated,
“to
the
employer
reserves
the
right
to
pay
a
premium
pay
over
and
above
the
contractual
classified
wage
rate
--
excuse
me,
to
reward
any
particular
employee
for
some
especial
skill,
fitness
skill
aptitude
and
the
like.”
this
is
the
provision
of
the
contract
upon
which
the
employer
relied
and
upon
which
the
board
placed
its
most
unusual
interpretation.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
think
not,
and
to
this
point
if
i
may
have
the
indulgence
of
the
court.
the
board
argument
inherently
implies
that
all
matter
is
not
agreed
upon
in
bargaining,
remain
subject
to
bargaining
before
a
change
is
permitted.
we
do
not
subscribe
to
that
argument.
we
believe
that
this
--
as
this
court
stated
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
decision,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
more
than
a
contract.
it
is
a
generalized
“to
govern
a
myriad
of
cases,
which
the
draftsman
cannot
wholly
anticipate.”
to
continue
this
court
through
justice
douglas
stated,
“collective
bargaining
agreements
regulate
or
restrict
the
exercise
of
management
functions.
they
do
not
oust
management
from
the
performance
of
them.
management
hires
and
fires,
pays
and
promotes,
supervises
and
plans,
all
of
these
are
a
part
of
its
function.
and
absent
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
may
be
exercised
freely
as
limited
by
public
law
and
by
the
willingness
of
employees
to
work
under
the
particular
unilaterally
imposed
conditions.
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
treat
only
with
certain
specific
practices
leaving
the
rest
to
management,
but
subject
to
the
possibility
of
a
work
stoppage
or
work
stoppages”
and
that
conclude
the
quote.
it
is
our
view
that
this
residual
management
rights
are
totally
ignored
in
the
board's
concept
that's
presented
here.
this
concept
also
is
overwhelmingly
accepted
by
the
labor
arbitrators
in
the
labor
arbitration
practice.
the
american
bar
association
labor
relation
section
devoted
a
part
three
as
i
recall
of
its
discussion
on
labor
arbitration
to
this
very
point.
while
there
was
an
effective,
but
i
would
say
a
minority
dissent,
it
is
clear
that
the
large
bulk
of
the
section
and
the
--
those
on
the
committee
and
of
arbitrators
do
feel
that
these
residual
rights
do
exist
just
as
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
this
case.
did
i
answer
your
question
sir?
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
the
board's
authority
is
statutory.
without
the
statute,
there
is
no
board.
the
authority
given
the
board
under
that
statute
while
broad
is
not
limitless.
here,
the
board
seeks
to
exercise
the
authority
to
administer
and
interpret
a
labor
contract
under
a
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice.
yet
neither
the
language
of
the
statute
nor
the
legislative
history
authorizes
this.
the
language
of
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
was
the
same
in
the
original
wagner
act
passed
in
1935
as
it
is
now.
in
1946
and
1947,
congress
was
very
concerned
with
the
usurpation
of
authority
by
the
board
under
this
particular
provision.
and
we
add
at
no
time
in
that
period,
prior
to
1946
and
1947,
had
the
board
gone
as
far
as
it
has
gone
in
this
case.
attention
is
directed
to
the
respondents
brief
at
page
38,
footnote
21.
there,
we
have
a
very
cryptic
analysis
of
the
house
committee
on
education
and
labor
in
which
that
committee
pointed
out,
“unless
congress
rights
into
the
law
guides
for
the
board
to
follow,
the
board
may
attempt
to
carry
this
process
still
further
to
seek
to
control
more
and
more
of
the
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.”
as
a
consequence,
congress
did
not
leave
it
to
the
board
to
make
this
determination
and
in
section
8(d)
chose
to
define
the
terms
to
bargain
collectively.
in
doing
so,
it
is
our
belief
that
what
congress
sought
to
do
was
to
create
an
atmosphere
under
which
collective
bargaining
could
thrive,
not
to
determine
the
terms
of
the
agreement
itself.
the
clause
or
the
section
itself
points
out
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
should
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession.
congress
also
went
out
--
went
on
at
great
lengths
to
spell
out
the
rights
and
the
duties
involved.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
shows
that
the
senate
in
1947,
in
the
bill
it
passed
provided
that
the
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
when
the
bill
got
into
conference,
the
house
is
not
having
a
comparable
provision
prevailed
and
that
portion
of
the
legislation
was
dropped.
it
is
clear
that
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
intended
to
encompass
contract
administration
as
is
further
evidenced
by
the
remarks
of
the
manager
of
the
senate
conferees,
the
late
senator
robert
taft
which
is
quoted
in
our
respondents
brief
at
pages
49
and
50.
he
knows
it
that
while
the
senate
conferees
yielded
on
the
elimination
of
the
violation
of
contract,
unfair
labor
practice.
they
retained
their
other
amendment
which
was
new
to
the
act
namely
section
301,
which
authorizes
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
labor
contract
controversy.
he
concluded,
“if
both
provisions
had
remained,”
that
is
both
the
violation
of
contract
unfair
labor
practice
and
section
301,
“there
would
have
been
a
probable
conflict
of
remedies
and
decisions.”
that
is
--
thus,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
concede
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
remedies
and
decisions
by
leaving
in
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice,
at
the
same
time
that
section
301
was
enacted.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
response
to
the
other
justices'
question,
this
was
the
point
i
was
hoping
that
i
had
covered
and
i'm
happy
that
you
ask
the
question
because
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
no,
no.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
find
that
my
communication
sometimes
is
not
good
and
i'm
glad
that
you
have
asked
the
question.
the
concept
as
we
view
it
is
that
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well
management
has
the
right
--
no,
there
shouldn't
have
been
unfair
labor
practice,
i
apologize.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
say
the
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction
unless,
in
the
course
of
this
situation,
the
employer
had
engaged
in
other
aspects
common
to
unfair
labor
practices,
anti-unanimous,
bad
faith
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
say
not.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
under
the
warrior
&
gulf
decision.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
this
case,
i
depend
upon
it
because
i
feel
that
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
facts
but
i
believe
stepping
one
side
--
one
step
away
from
this
case
in
response
to
your
question.
no,
i
don't
believe
unfair
labor
practice
exists
in
that.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
and
this
is
where
i
believe
is
warrior
&
gulf
decision
applies,
that
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
because
all
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
seeks
to
do
is
to
govern
management.
that
is
one
of
the
elements,
substantial
elements.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no.
we
can
find
alternates
to
that
where
the
necessity
to
bargain
i
think
would
be
a
part
of
it.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
a
new
job,
one
that
had
never
existed
before,
for
which
no
rate
had
been
set
or
negotiated.
i
believe
that
there
--
the
employer
has
the
responsibility
of
negotiating
the
rate
of
that
job
with
the
union.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
wouldn't
like
to
say
under
no
circumstances.
but
at
the
moment,
i
would
say
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
they
would
not
have
that
right
as
i
view
the
present
posture
of
the
labor
law
although
i
acknowledge
the
fact
that
there
is
a
dissent
to
that
view.
finally,
the
conference
report
of
which
was
the
outgrowth
of
the
senate
and
the
house
deliberations
in
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
conclusively
buttresses
the
respondent's
contention
here
when
it
concludes
with
this
language
and
“once
party's
have
made
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
should
be
left
to
the
usual
process
of
the
law.”
and
i
would
like
to
add
because
i
feel
that
this
is
an
essential
and
a
very
important
part
of
this
quote.
they
continued,
“and
not
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.”
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
board
should
have
the
right
to
interpret
construe
and
force
or
administer
labor
contract
either
indirectly
or
directly
is
also
evidenced
by
the
fact
the
73rd
congress
in
1934,
the
congress
immediately
preceding
the
74th
which
in
1935
passed
the
wagner
act,
amended
the
railway
labor
act
establishing
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
in
that
legislation,
congress
spelled
out
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
was
to
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
the
speech
between
employees,
unions
and
carriers
growing
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
railroad
labor
agreements.
if
congress
had
intended
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
surely
involve
itself
in
the
administration
of
labor
contract,
it
certainly
had
the
skill
and
the
precedent
on
how
to
write
such
a
statute.
since
congress
did
not
choose
to
apply
even
remotely
the
language
used
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
is
conclusive
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
should
exercise
the
authority
that
it
search
here.
the
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
has
been
stated
in
the
same
language
from
the
inception
of
this
legislation.
yet,
in
well
over
25
years,
through
ever
changing
personnel
of
different
political
motivations,
no
effort
was
made
by
the
board
to
assert
itself
in
a
situation
such
as
this
until
1964.
and
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
all
circuits
to
date,
so
far
as
i
can
find,
are
in
complete
harmony
with
the
viewpoint
that
prevailed
in
the
board
prior
to
1964.
there
can
be
no
question.
the
employer's
conduct
here
was
in
complete
good
faith.
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
of
anti-unionanimous.
the
interpretation
made
by
the
employer
was
reasonable
and
a
study
of
the
situation
involved
will
show
that
it
was
completely
proper
and
tenable.
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
union
was
entitled
to
relive,
it
had
many
alternates
that
is
available
to
it.
one,
it
could
have
gone
to
a
federal
part
under
301.
it
could
have
gone
secondly
under
--
to
the
state
court
for
a
contract
violation
on
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
each
position
would
be
that
the
company
violated
the
provision
--
provisions
of
its
contract.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
correct.
that's
correct.
it
would
say
that
the
employer
exercised
in
authority
that
it
did
not
have
under
the
contract.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
don't
see
what
the
element
of
damages
would
be
unless
of
course
the
--
there
would
be
some
inference
here
that
the
union's
integrity
and
reputation
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
say
yes.
i've
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
it
would
at
least
settle
this
question
as
it
would
appear
congress
intended
that
the
party
should
settle
disputes
between
them
over
contract
interpretations.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
would
assume
that
either
specific
performance
or
an
injunction
might
lie,
which
would
get
the
result
that
they
would
be
--
which
the
union
would
be
seeking.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
actually,
it
is
our
belief
that
sec
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that's
correct.
however
into
the
wag
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
provided
an
unfair
labor
practice
exist.
in
other
words,
the
board's
powers
are
very
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
and
of
course
we're
--
our
argument
here
is
that
no
unfair
labor
practice
does
exist.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no
the
board
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
it
con't
--
yes.
it
--
but
you
say
such
as
this
and
this
is
where
unfortunately,
i
must
part
company.
the
10(a)
is
explicit
in
give
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
true,
however
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
because
the
board
must
first
as
a
threshold
matter
interpret
the
contract
and
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
the
clear
intent
of
congress.
that
this
was
not
what
congress
contemplated
the
board
should
engage
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
is
also
complete
or
replete
with
the
concept
of
the
congress
did
want
compulsory
arbitration.
and
actually
as
i
see
this
case,
assuming
that
the
court
should
unfortunately
decided
against
me,
we've
made
one
gigantic
step
off
into
compulsory
arbitration.
why?
because
every
contract
contains
in
one
form
or
another,
some
control
over
a
management
right
or
even
a
union
right
so
that
a
brief
party
can
run
to
the
board.
the
board
makes
an
interpretation
and
here
we
have
our
--
a
compulsory
arbitration
and
as
you
observe
in
this,
our
own
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
accepting
that
it
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
a
sense
it
is,
excepting
that
here,
the
statutory
intent
was
that
the
board
should
not
engage
in
this
activity.
but
it
should
go
to
a
court.
we
get
to
this
matter
of
the
board
expertise
and
it's
clear
that
congress
in
1947
didn't
believe
that
this
expertise
existed.
and
we
also
get
to
the
case
of
dowd
box
company
versus
courtney
in
which
this
court
articulated
which
the
principles
i
believe
that
are
applicable
in
this
case.
at
page
513
of
that
case,
the
court
clearly
delineated
the
authority
of
the
board.
it
was
pointed
out
that
while
congress
confided
primarily
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statutory
rules
to
the
board,
it
rejected
that
policy
with
respect
to
violations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
instead,
the
court
concluded
and
i
“congress
deliberately
chose
to
lead
the
enforcement
of
collective
agreement
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.”
the
other
alternatives
that
were
available
to
the
union
as
i
view
it,
although
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
which
one
of
thee
you
may
believe
to
be
a
more
effective
than
another,
they
could
have
gone
to
state
court
as
the
second
alternative.
the
third
alternative,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
sought
their
intervention
in
this
matter.
and
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service,
i
might
say
from
personal
experience
is
a
very
effective
organization.
they
could
have
sought
as
the
fourth
alternative,
the
state
mediation
facilities.
the
fifth
matter
which
is
not
formed
to
a
timber
products
industry
of
the
great
northwest
is
arbitration
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
sixth,
they
could
have
press
their
point
further
in
collective
bargaining
under
the
grievance
procedure.
or
lastly
as
i
viewed
this
matter,
they
could
have
waited
to
the
next
or
to
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
contract.
and
said
now,
“looking
here
mr.
employer,
we
didn't
like
mean
what
we
said
back
there
and
requested
the
appropriate
revision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
we
would
have
believed
that
the
arbitration
clause
should
have
been
pursued
and
this
matter
submitted
to
an
arbitration
board.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
no
court
action
under
your
trilogy,
yes.
no
court
action,
i
should
have
thought.
the
board
argument
runs
that
it
is
entitled
to
construe
the
provisions
of
a
labor
contract
when
such
construction
is
necessary
to
vindicate
statutory
unfair
labor
practices
when
we
realized
that
almost
every
provision
of
a
labor
contract
in
one
sense
or
another
governs,
wages
outs
in
working
conditions,
we
can
see
that
the
board
can
reason
its
way
into
almost
every
dispute
over
an
interpretation
of
a
contract.
it
can
weigh
the
respective
interpretations
and
if
the
construction
that
it
chooses,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
then
in
their
opinion
then
they
can
find
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
exists.
as
we
view
it
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
some
appropriate
statistics,
the
board
claims
it
is
overburdened
now.
its
trial
examiners
admit
that
it
is
overburdened
now.
to
open
wide
the
doors
that
this
case
would
open
wide
simply
would
add
to
the
burden
of
the
board.
one
last
point,
we
also
feel
that
industrial
stability
will
result
from
the
board's
unwarranted
invasion
of
contract
administration.
the
board
is
now
saying
that
an
employer's
action
which
if
the
board
determines,
he's
not
allowed
by
a
labor
agreement.
that
is
a
contract
violation.
constitutes
an
8
(a)(5)
or
a
refusal
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
ma
--
in
the
mastro
plastics
case
this
court
held
at
most
“no
strike”
clauses
do
not
bar
a
strike
which
is
occasioned
by
an
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.
any
claim
of
violation,
employer
violation
of
a
labor
agreement,
that
is
any
grievance,
may
thus
justify
the
union
to
legally
strike
in
spite
of
a
no
strike
clause.
this,
we
believe,
will
only
create
chaos
not
stability
in
the
--
american
industrial
scene.
to
permit
the
bar
to
interpret
contracts
under
circumstances
such
as
exists
here,
clearly
circumvents
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
manifest
congressional
intent.
the
board
should
not
be
permitted
to
indirectly
accomplish
a
purpose
which
has
no
direct
authorization
in
the
act.
to
grant
the
board
request,
we
believe,
is
tantamount
to
poisoning
compulsory
arbitration
upon
american
industry
when
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
it
did
not
approved
of
compulsory
arbitration
of
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
matter
was
correct.
thank
you.
