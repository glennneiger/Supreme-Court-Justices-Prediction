justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
employer
here
as
i
understand
it
says,
“we
did
bargain.
we
did
bargain
in
good
faith
and
we
provided
in
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
our
liberty
to
do
just
what
we
did
here.
and
when
you're
asking
us
not
to
bargain
about
this,
it's
you,
the
union
who
is
in
bad
faith
because
we
bargained
about
that
and
reach
to
an
agreement.”
justice
potter
stewart
well
of
course,
the
employer's
position
is,
i'm
not
making
any
modifications
in
the
contract,
i'm
simply
doing
what
i
was
permitted
to
do
as
a
result
of
our
previous
collective
bargaining.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
i
wonder
what
the
point
of
collective
bargaining
is,
if
you
can
never
reach
a
bargain
that
sticks.
justice
potter
stewart
this
goes
to,
this
goes
to
--
this
argument
goes
to
the
merit
so
to
speak,
i.e.
to
whether
or
not
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
permitted
the
employer
to
do
what
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
covered
by
the
provision
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn't
it
still
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
on
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
that
provision
that
permits
him
to
pay
premium
pay,
whether
or
not
that
provision
covered
what
he
did
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
number
53,
national
labor
relations
board
petitioner
and
c
&
c
plywood
corp.
the
case
which
we
brought
here
on
certiorari
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
employer
the
plywood
corp.
was
brought
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
answer
a
complaint
that
if
inauguration
of
a
premium
pay
plan
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
without
prior
consultation
with
the
union
representing
its
employees
violated
the
duties
imposed
by
section
8(a)(5)
and
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
issued
a
cease-and-desist
order
and
rejected
the
claim
and
respondent's
action
was
authorized
by
the
collective
agreement.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
refused
however
to
enforce
the
board's
order,
the
court
reasoned
that
a
provision
and
the
agreement,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer
which
arguably
allow
the
employer
to
institute
the
premium
pay
plan
absolutely
divested
the
board
of
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
union's
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
what
seems
to
us
a
substantial
question
of
federal
labor
law.
so
the
reason
said
out
in
some
detail
and
a
written
opinion
which
has
been
filed
with
a
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
enforcement
of
the
board's
order.
