mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
have
pleased
the
court.
this
case
here
on
the
read
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
presents
a
question
related
to
the
one
that
was
before
the
court
yesterday
in
the
acme
case.
here,
a
union
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
a
charge
that
an
employer
had
failed
to
bargain
in
violation
of
section
985
act,
because
of
certain
unilateral
changes
in
wages
that
the
employer
had
made
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
the
employer
offered
as
a
defense,
that
what
he
had
done
was
sanctioned
by
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
and
the
question
presented
in
the
case
is
whether
in
order
to
determine
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
authority
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
rather
than
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
board
is
required
to
re-meet
the
parties
to
a
judicial
lawsuit
in
order
to
have
that
issue
determine
because
in
this
case,
unlike
the
acme
case,
the
contract
does
not
contain
an
arbitration
provision.
the
company
is
a
manufacturer
of
plywood
and
the
employees
involved
here
are
members
of
something
called
a
““glue
spreader””
crew.
this
is
a
group
of
employees
who
glues
together
the
various
pieces
of
the
wood
that
combine
to
make
the
finished
piece
of
plywood.
the
crew
ordinarily
consists
of
four
employees
and
these
four
employees
have
broken
down
into
three
different
categories
of
workers.
the
company
ended
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union
under
which
particular
wages
was
set
for
each
of
these
three
different
jobs
in
the
“glue
spreader”
crew,
rending
from
$2.15
to
$2.29
an
hour,
and
the
contract
also
provided
that
during
its
term,
the
wages
would
be
closed.
paragraph
17
of
the
contract,
which
is
a
critical
paragraphing
above
here
and
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
67
of
the
record,
after
stating
that
the
employer
and
the
union
had
agreed
upon
a
classified
wage
scale
which
was
incorporated
in
the
contract
went
on
to
state
that
the
employer
reserves
the
right
to
pay
a
premium
rate
over
and
above
the
contractual
classified
wage
rights
to
reward
any
particular
employee
for
some
special
fitness,
skill,
aptitude
or
the
like.
three
weeks
after
this
contract
had
been
signed,
without
consulting
a
bargaining
with
the
union,
the
company
inaugurated
what
it
called
a
premium
pay
plan
for
the
“glue
spreaders”.
that
plan
is
set
forth
to
page
73
of
the
record,
and
what
it
provided
in
essence
was
that
whenever,
in
any
particular
one-week
period,
the
glue
crew,
the
four
members,
exceeded
a
certain
production
quota,
each
member
of
the
crew
was
to
get
not
the
schedule
rate
in
the
contract
that
a
higher
amount
of
$2.15
an
hour,
every
member
of
the
crew
was
to
get
this.
it
was
not
tied
to
the
performance
of
any
individual
person.
the
union
found
out
about
this
plan
when
a
member
of
the
union
brought
a
copy
of
the
thing
and
the
union
and
the
company
then
met
on
two
occasions
in
which
the
union
protested
that
this
proposed
glue
spreader
plan
was
not
justified
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
the
union
explained
to
the
company
in
its
view
that
this
was
not
just
a
change
in
wages
but
a
basic
change
in
the
method
of
computing
wages.
it
was
not
just
giving
a
premium
but
involved
a
shift
in
computing
wages
from
a
straight
alley
basis
to
a
production
basis
and
therefore,
in
the
union's
view
is
not
justified
by
the
contract.
the
company
on
the
other
hand,
contended
that
it
was
justified
by
the
contract
and
refused
to
cancel
the
plan
and
then
the
union
filed
a
charge
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
company
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
instituting
this
plan.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
that
the
whole
controversy
from
the
company's
point
of
view
has
turned
on
their
claim
that
under
this
provision
of
the
contract,
it
was
--
they
were
justified
in
what
they
did.
the
--
at
the
full
usual
administrative
proceedings,
the
board
held
that
in
initiating
this
premium
pay
plan,
the
company
had
refused
to
bargain
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)(5)
and
it
entered
an
order
in
effect
directing
the
company
not
to
institute
such
a
plan
without
first
bargaining
with
the
union
and
if
the
union
were
to
request
it
to
resend
the
particular
plan
that
it
had
inaugurated.
the
board
rejected
the
company's
contention
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
unfair
labor
practice
because
in
order
to
do
so,
it
would
have
to
interpret
the
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
friedman
well
this
would
--
this
mr.
justice
would
present
a
difficult
problem
which
i
will
come
to
the
implication
to
this
in
a
minute
because
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
an
employer
cannot,
without
bargaining
with
the
union
under
section
8
(a)(5)
unilaterally
change
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
friedman
well,
the
union
has
the
right
to
waive
rights
under
the
contract
and
the
question
in
that
case
would
be,
whether
what
was
done
was
sufficient
in
all
the
circumstances
to
constitute
a
waiver.
there
have
been
as
was
suggested
yesterday's
argument
that
the
board's
power
to
deal
with
unfair
labor
practices
under
section
10
(a)
is
not
limited
by
any
other
existing
remedy
and
the
question
would
be
whether
in
all
the
circumstances,
the
--
mr.
friedman
we
don't
think
that
is
in
the
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
friedman
is
that
end
--
well
the
board
wouldn't
think
so.
i
can't
answer
that
question
unequivocally.
mr.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
the
real
issue
was
whether
the
board
has
the
authority
to
interpret
the
contract
that
was
--
mr.
friedman
well,
if
--
mr.
friedman
if
--
if
this
court
would
hold
that
this
provision
of
the
contract
does
not
--
does
permit
this
plan,
i
would
seem
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
but
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
is
--
mr.
friedman
and
then
i'm
coming
back
a
moment
to
what
the
board
held
in
this
case.
it
pointed
out
that
it
has
frequently
interpreted
contracts
in
performing
its
functions
under
the
act
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
proceeding
had
been
invoked
by
the
parties.
there
was
no
pending
arbitration
proceeding
either
before
a
court
or
an
arbitrator
and
therefore
the
reasons
which
sometimes
lead
the
board
to
defer
to
the
tendency
of
another
proceeding
were
not
present
here.
the
board
then
turned,
went
on
an
interpreted
a
particular
contract
and
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
its
examination
of
the
language
of
the
contract
and
the
negotiations
between
the
parties
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision,
this
premium
pay
plan,
was
only
to
give
the
employer
the
right
to
make
individual
merit
increases
for
the
special
competence
of
a
particular
employee
but
not
to
select
a
group
of
employees
and
unilaterally
to
change
the
basic
method
of
compensating
them
from
a
straight
time
basis
to
a
production
basis.
and
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
board
concluded
that
what
had
been
done
by
the
union
in
this
case
did
not
amount
to
a
waiver
on
its
part
of
the
right
to
bargain
about
what
it
called
a
wage
incentive
system.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
it
stated
its
problems,
it
said,
since
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
does
not
turn
entirely
upon
the
provisions
of
the
act.
but
arguably
upon
a
good
faith
dispute
as
to
the
correct
meaning
of
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
board
had
no
jurisdiction
to
proceed
because
it
said,
whether
or
not
this
contract
authorize
what
the
company
had
done,
was
a
matter
to
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator
if
there
was
an
arbitration
provision
or
if
no
such
provision
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
court.
now,
the
answer
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
that
we
and
the
respondent
are
in
common
ground
on
two
general
propositions.
first,
that
the
board
has
no
general
authority
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
secondly,
that
the
mere
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
itself
is
not
enough
to
create
and
give
rise
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
will
we
part
company
with
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
when
it
argues
that
here,
basically
the
unfair
labor
practice
rest
upon
the
breach
of
the
contract.
we
think
that
is
not
the
basis
here.
that
here,
the
unfair
labor
practice
rested
on
the
company's
failure
to
perform
its
duty
to
bargain
with
the
employer
--
with
the
union
before
making
any
material
changes
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
i
think
the
board
stated
its
philosophy
of
the
decision
in
this
case
very
well
at
the
bottom
page
96,
where
it
said
that
in
filing
its
unfair
labor
practice,
the
union
was
complaining
not
of
a
violation
of
its
contract
with
respondent
but
of
the
invasion
of
its
statutory
right
as
collective
bargaining
representative
of
employees
in
the
unit
to
bargain
about
any
changes
in
the
terms
and
condition
of
employment
for
such
employee.
so
as
we
see
the
case
here,
basically,
we
think
it
involves
three
issues.
one,
whether
apart
from
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
what
the
employer
did
here
constituted
is
the
refusal
to
bargain.
two,
whether
the
board
was
authorized
in
itself
interpreting
the
contract
rather
than
leaving
it
to
the
parties
to
go
to
court,
and
three,
whether
in
the
fact
to
this
case,
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
contract
was
proper
one.
now
i'd
like
the
first
turn
of
the
threshold
issue
of
refusal
to
bargain
which
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
respondent
does
not
challenged
here
but
since
this
is
the
keystone
of
the
board's
decision,
i
think
it's
a
accordant
to
deal
with
it
briefly.
the
duty
with
section
8
(a)(5)
imposes
on
an
employer
and
a
union
to
bargain
collectively
is
defined
in
section
8
(d)
as
the
performance
of
the
mutual
obligation
of
the
employer
and
the
union
to
meet
at
reasonable
times
and
confer
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
a
negotiation
of
any
agreement
or
any
question
arising
there
under.
mr.
friedman
well
that
mr.
justice,
the
union
--
it
isn't
that
the
union
is
asking
the
employer
to
bargain
--
our
position
is
that
during
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
the
employer
attempts
unilaterally
without
bargaining
with
the
union
to
make
any
substantial
modifications
in
that
thing,
he
cannot
do
it.
mr.
friedman
that's
right,
but
that
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
is
a
defense
basically.
this
is
something
you
--
mr.
friedman
well,
you
can
mr.
justice
if
they
had
reached
the
bargain.
but
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
what
the
union
agreed
to
in
this
case,
in
effect
gave
the
employer
authority
to
make
this
kind
of
a
change
which
the
employer
says
he
did
have.
and
we
say
that
on
the
circumstances
it
did
not
authorize
the
employer
to
make
a
change.
but
we
further
say
that
in
deciding
whether
there
has
been
a
refusal
to
bargain
here,
the
board
is
authorized
to
examine
the
basis
on
which
the
employer
purported
to
justify
what
he
had
done.
now,
this
as
was
developed
also
during
the
argument
in
the
preceding
case
the
duty
of
the
bargaining
we
think
clearly
is
not
limited
just
to
working
out
the
initial
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
continues
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
now,
four
years
ago
in
the
katz
case,
this
court
held
that
where
during
negotiations,
an
employer
unilaterally
and
without
consulting
with
the
union,
made
significant
changes
in
the
rights
of
pay
in
sick
leave,
that
that
constituted
a
refusal
to
bargain
without
regard
to
the
employer's
good
faith.
and
as
i
put
it
in
so
holding
that
such
unilateral
changes
said,
frustrates
the
objectives
of
section
8(a)(5)
much
as
does
a
flat
refusal
to
negotiate
at
all.
and
we
think
the
same
reasoning
requires
that
during
the
term
of
a
collective
agreement,
after
the
agreement
has
been
added
on
into,
similarly,
neither
side
can
make
unilateral
changes
without
conferring
with
the
other.
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
whole
concept
of
requiring
collective
bargaining
embodied
in
8(a)(5),
is
that
industrial
peace
will
be
furthered.
if
the
parties
to
a
contract
before
making
changes
get
together
and
talk
about
it,
they
don't
have
to
reach
agreement
that's
explicit
in
the
statute.
but
we
think
they
do
have
to
get
together
and
talk
about
it
and
therefore,
the
philosophy
of
the
statute
is
neither
side
can
make
significant
changes
in
the
basic
employment
relationship,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
without
first
considering,
without
first
consulting
and
discussing
it
with
the
other
side.
now
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
very
clearly
that
the
change
that
the
employer
made
was
a
significant
change.
under
the
contract,
does
it
previously
existed
--
mr.
friedman
well,
let
me
--
i'm
going
to
have
to
answer
your
--
answer
you
mr.
justice
in
two
stages.
the
order
in
this
case,
the
only
unfair
labor
practice
found
in
this
case
was
the
refusal
to
bargain.
and
of
course,
the
whole
--
i
think
the
whole
theory
of
it
is,
if
the
employer
had
said
to
the
union,
“we
now
propose
to
institute
this
plan
and
if
you'd
like
to
discuss
it,
fine.”
in
the
course
of
the
discussion,
there
may
have
been
some
changes.
the
union
might
have
been
able
to
talk
the
employer
out
of
it.
mr.
friedman
well
then
it's
--
mr.
friedman
then
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
--
then
the
employer
has
satisfied
his
duty
under
this
order
to
bargain.
that's
what
--
mr.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
friedman
in
this
case,
what
happened
was,
the
employer
without
consulting
with
the
union
inaugurated
this
plan.
then
they
met
after
the
plan
had
been
inaugurated
and
the
union
tried
to
get
them
to
resend
it
and
the
employer
said,
“no,
we
think
we
are
authorized
by
the
contract.”
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
very
great
difference
between
bargaining
between
the
parties
before
you
do
something
and
bargaining
after
it
has
been
done
and
attempt
to
resend
it.
mr.
friedman
that
is
correct
under
this
case.
now
i
have
to
in
all
candor
state
that
since
this
decision,
the
board
has
gone
somewhat
beyond
the
position
has
taken
here,
in
the
c
and
s
case,
which
we
sided
into
our
brief
--
the
board
is
going
beyond
this
and
they
said
that
in
this
situation
section
8(d)
of
the
act,
precludes
the
employer
for
making
even
a
unilateral
change
after
bargain,
they
construe
section
8(d)
is
saying
that
during
the
term
of
a
contract,
an
employer
has
no
right
to
modified
in
significant
respect
so
that
under
that
decision,
a
broader
order
would
have
been
independent
than
in
this
case.
but
in
this
case,
the
board
did
not
go
that
far
and
at
the
present
time,
quite
frankly,
the
board's
thinking
in
this,
on
this
subject
is
in
a
developing
area.
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
as
far
as
this
order
is
concerned,
all
of
this
order
requires
the
company
to
do
is
to
bargain
with
the
employee
--
with
the
union
before
inaugurating
this
plan.
now
i
like
to
come
back
to
a
minute
to
the
significance
of
the
change
that
was
made
here,
because
i
think
this
is
very
critical.
before
this
provision
have
been
inaugurated,
each
member
of
this
crew
received
a
different
wage
with
presumably
reflected
the
varying
skills,
range
from
$2.14
or
$2.15
to
$2.29,
and
the
record
shows,
this
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
very
carefully
put
out
in
the
negotiations.
under
this
plan,
the
distinctions
between
the
different
members
of
the
union
have
been
abandoned.
what
happens
is,
once
the
“glue
spreader”
crew
exceeds
the
production
standard
set
here,
every
member
gets
$2.50.
the
lowest
paid
man
who
used
to
get
to
$2.15
gets
$2
and
a
half.
the
highest
paid
man
who
used
to
get
$2.29
gets
$2
and
a
half.
if
in
fact,
there's
one
man
of
this
four-member
crew
who
is
inefficient,
but
despite
that
the
other
three
members
are
so
efficient
that
they
can
manage
to
achieve
the
production
quota,
they
all
four
get
the
$2
and
a
half.
now
--
mr.
friedman
this
goes
mr.
friedman
this
goes
to
the
merit
but
also
i
was
also
tending
to
show
that
the
change
that
was
made
here
was
a
very
significant
change.
it
wasn't
just
a
minor
adjustment.
it
was
a
basic
change
in
the
way
on
which
wage
is
calculated.
mr.
friedman
yes,
that's
correct.
and
this
brings
me
mr.
justice
if
may
discuss
that
in
the
context
of
why
we
think
the
board
in
this
kind
of
a
case
does
have
authority
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
won't
labor
because
it
was
discussed
considerably
yesterday
the
statutory
language
itself
in
section
10
(a)
which
provides
that
the
board's
power
to
deal
with
unfair
labor
practices
should
not
be
in
any
way
affected
by
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
established
by
agreement
law
or
otherwise
because
it
seems
very
clear
to
us
that
if
the
board
is
not
authorized
to
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
when
it
comes
to
pass
on
an
unfair
labor
practice,
its
power
to
prevent
such
practices
would
be
affected.
for
one
thing,
it's
just
a
matter
of
the
time
it
takes.
the
parties
have
to
first
go
and
institute
a
lawsuit.
it's
bound
to
take
a
lot
longer
than
the
board
the
proceeding.
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
this
but
said,
it
didn't
think
that
made
any
difference.
it's
also
significant
we
think
that
this
proviso
of
the
section
10
(a)
was
part
of
the
original
wagner
act
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
labor
management
act,
congress
consciously
decided
to
retain
this
provision.
and
in
so
doing,
it
stated
that
the
remedies
before
the
board
to
deal
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
were
intended
to
be
in
addition
to
and
not
in
lieu
of
with
other
--
what
other
remedies
might
be
available
in
another
forum.
mr.
friedman
10
(a)?
mr.
friedman
i
don't
remember
any
case
on
that
mr.
justice.
now,
coming
to
the
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
i
stand
corrected.
in
some
of
the
preemption
cases,
i
think
the
court
has
talked
about
that
proviso
(voice
overlap).
mr.
friedman
i
think
so
mr.
justice
and
also
i
think
in
carey-westinghouse.
and
i
think
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
did
indicate
that
the
existence
of
the
judicial
remedy
would
not
oust
the
board
of
its
jurisdiction.
now,
i'd
like
to
also
comment.
therefore,
it
seems
in
the
light
of
this
that
the
board
should
not
be
deemed
to
be
precluded
from
dealing
with
this
matter,
unless
to
a
very
strong
policy
considerations
which
dictated
in
favor
of
giving
exclusive
authority
in
this
area
to
the
court.
so
we
think
the
policy
considerations,
not
only
don't
reached
that
result,
but
affirmatively
support
to
the
board's
jurisdiction.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
power
--
as
a
matter
of
power,
i
don't
think
the
board
--
mr.
friedman
no,
i'm
afraid
i
don't.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
we'll
allow
to
deference
mr.
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
when
we're
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
problem,
the
board's
expertise
should
be
given
great
weight.
let
me
see
if
i
could
explain
that
position
to
you.
mr.
friedman
this
is
independently
of
the
10
(a)
argument.
there
is
the
fact
of
course
that
i
don't
know
all
the
details
of
the
power
act.
so
i
don't
believe
if
it's
anything
comparable.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe.
but
in
determining
that
the
question,
the
ultimate
question
in
terms
of
interpreting
the
contract,
is
whether
when
the
union
agreed
that
the
employer
could
have
the
right
to
pay
a
premium
pay
over
and
above
the
contractual
classified
rate
to
award
any
employee.
the
question
in
that
instance
is
whether
this
authorized
them
to
inaugurate
a
plan
covering
groups
of
employees,
changing
the
basis
or
merely
to
single
out
a
particular
employee
and
say,
“you
employee
brown,
you
are
very
skilled.
we're
going
to
pay
you
not
$2.25
but
$2.40.”
as
i
might
add,
there
was
an
instance,
there
was
one
employee
that
the
record
shows,
but
why
at
the
time
of
this
--
time
for
this
negotiation
was
being
paid
the
premium
rate.
he
was
getting
$2.40
although
the
contract
was
$2.29.
now,
we
would
suggest
that
in
answering
that
question,
it's
not
enough
just
to
look
at
the
particular
terms
of
the
contract
when
what
you're
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
in
doing
this
thing,
the
employer
has
violated
his
duty
to
bargain.
because
the
whole
question
it
seems
to
us
is
so
intertwined
with
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
with
the
federal
labor
policy.
that
to
answer
this
question
calls
to
something
more
than
just
the
kind
of
analysis
that
a
court
would
traditionally
make
in
interpreting
the
contract.
they
come
into
play
--
it
comes
into
play
for
example,
the
well-settled
rule
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
upheld,
that
a
waiver
of
statutory
rights
will
not
be
implied
unless
it
is
clearly
and
unquestionably
set
forth.
now,
we
have
here
a
history
of
bargaining
negotiations
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
and
in
the
course
of
these
negotiations
on
one
or
two
occasions,
some
reference
was
made
to
the
employer
considering
the
inauguration
of
a
premium
paid
plan
for
the
“glue
spreader”
crew.
there's
nothing
--
and
one
of
the
instance
the
union
said,
nothing
on
the
other
instance
when
the
employer
referred
to
the
fact
that
another
company
in
the
area
had
proposed
such
a
plan
but
had
withdrawn
it
when
that
union
objected,
the
union
representative
said
they
couldn't
agree
to
such
a
thing.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
where
it
is
necessary
to
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
there
has
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
in
carrying
out
its
statutory
duties
to
determine
unfair
labor
practices
made
to
that
extent
interprets
the
contract.
mr.
friedman
that's
right.
there
may
be
many
situations
where
the
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
will
give
rise
both
to
a
possible
action
of
breach
of
contract
and
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
of
course
the
board
--
this
is
not
the
only
area
where
the
board
has
to
interpret
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
--
mr.
friedman
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
as
i
say,
that
the
board
for
example,
that
there
are
certain
portions
of
the
statute
where
the
mere
entering
into
of
a
particular
type
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
unfair
labor
practice.
such
as
entering
to
a
hot
cargo
bringing
all
aboard
there,
it's
never
been
suggested
to
our
knowledge
that
when
it's
charged
to
the
particular
contract
is
a
violation
of
the
hot
cargo
provision,
that
it's
necessary
for
the
board
to
defer.
similarly
when
on
the
board
has
to
determine
a
dispute
--
a
representation
dispute
on
the
10(a),
it
traditionally
interprets
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
friedman
well
i
think
--
mr.
friedman
i
think
there
mr.
justice
we
would
say
that
the
congress
in
an
act
in
301
intended
to
open
up
broadly
the
federal
courts
and
this
court's
decisions
i
think
in
the
preemption
case
have
indicated
that
this
--
mr.
friedman
well
the
congress
--
mr.
friedman
--
congress
in
those
situations
mr.
justice
i
suggest
was
not
addressing
itself
to
the
problem
of
the
board's
authority
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practice
as
it
was
addressing
itself
to
the
question
of
what
remedy
is
the
best
--
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
in
this
situation
the
board's
interpretation
should
be
given
very
substantial
deference
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
friedman
no,
we
support
in
fact
the
government
urge
--
mr.
friedman
well
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
justice,
it's
consistent
because
there
are
different
problems
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
301
suit,
in
the
301
suit
--
mr.
friedman
well
i
would
--
perhaps
mr.
justice,
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was
that
in
the
301
suit
the
issue
is
framed
in
the
court
ordinarily
in
a
much
narrower
context
than
before
the
board.
i
was
suggesting,
the
board's
expertise
is
important
in
this
area
because
the
question
of
contract
instruction
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
tied
in
with
the
question
of
statutory
violation
whereas
in
the
301
suit,
it's
ordinarily
only
the
question
contract
interpretation.
mr.
friedman
i
would
think
it
may
have
been.
i
would
think
it
probably
was.
mr.
friedman
well,
but
mr.
justice
if
i
may
come
back
in
such
a
suit
by
the
union,
the
only
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
contract
authorizes,
who
wouldn't
get
to
the
--
any
questions
as
to
whether
the
question
of
suggestion
go
way
with
the
statutory
rights,
you
wouldn't
have
to
get-in
in
the
301
suit
to
the
problem
of
whether
there
was
a
refusal
to
bargain.
whereas
it
seems
to
me
the
board's
expertise
comes
into
play
in
evaluating
the
contract
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
policies
reflected
in
the
labor
act.
mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
have
pleased
the
court.
this
case
here
on
the
read
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
presents
a
question
related
to
the
one
that
was
before
the
court
yesterday
in
the
acme
case.
here,
a
union
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
a
charge
that
an
employer
had
failed
to
bargain
in
violation
of
section
985
act,
because
of
certain
unilateral
changes
in
wages
that
the
employer
had
made
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
the
employer
offered
as
a
defense,
that
what
he
had
done
was
sanctioned
by
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
and
the
question
presented
in
the
case
is
whether
in
order
to
determine
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
authority
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
rather
than
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
board
is
required
to
re-meet
the
parties
to
a
judicial
lawsuit
in
order
to
have
that
issue
determine
because
in
this
case,
unlike
the
acme
case,
the
contract
does
not
contain
an
arbitration
provision.
the
company
is
a
manufacturer
of
plywood
and
the
employees
involved
here
are
members
of
something
called
a
““glue
spreader””
crew.
this
is
a
group
of
employees
who
glues
together
the
various
pieces
of
the
wood
that
combine
to
make
the
finished
piece
of
plywood.
the
crew
ordinarily
consists
of
four
employees
and
these
four
employees
have
broken
down
into
three
different
categories
of
workers.
the
company
ended
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union
under
which
particular
wages
was
set
for
each
of
these
three
different
jobs
in
the
“glue
spreader”
crew,
rending
from
$2.15
to
$2.29
an
hour,
and
the
contract
also
provided
that
during
its
term,
the
wages
would
be
closed.
paragraph
17
of
the
contract,
which
is
a
critical
paragraphing
above
here
and
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
67
of
the
record,
after
stating
that
the
employer
and
the
union
had
agreed
upon
a
classified
wage
scale
which
was
incorporated
in
the
contract
went
on
to
state
that
the
employer
reserves
the
right
to
pay
a
premium
rate
over
and
above
the
contractual
classified
wage
rights
to
reward
any
particular
employee
for
some
special
fitness,
skill,
aptitude
or
the
like.
three
weeks
after
this
contract
had
been
signed,
without
consulting
a
bargaining
with
the
union,
the
company
inaugurated
what
it
called
a
premium
pay
plan
for
the
“glue
spreaders”.
that
plan
is
set
forth
to
page
73
of
the
record,
and
what
it
provided
in
essence
was
that
whenever,
in
any
particular
one-week
period,
the
glue
crew,
the
four
members,
exceeded
a
certain
production
quota,
each
member
of
the
crew
was
to
get
not
the
schedule
rate
in
the
contract
that
a
higher
amount
of
$2.15
an
hour,
every
member
of
the
crew
was
to
get
this.
it
was
not
tied
to
the
performance
of
any
individual
person.
the
union
found
out
about
this
plan
when
a
member
of
the
union
brought
a
copy
of
the
thing
and
the
union
and
the
company
then
met
on
two
occasions
in
which
the
union
protested
that
this
proposed
glue
spreader
plan
was
not
justified
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
the
union
explained
to
the
company
in
its
view
that
this
was
not
just
a
change
in
wages
but
a
basic
change
in
the
method
of
computing
wages.
it
was
not
just
giving
a
premium
but
involved
a
shift
in
computing
wages
from
a
straight
alley
basis
to
a
production
basis
and
therefore,
in
the
union's
view
is
not
justified
by
the
contract.
the
company
on
the
other
hand,
contended
that
it
was
justified
by
the
contract
and
refused
to
cancel
the
plan
and
then
the
union
filed
a
charge
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
company
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
instituting
this
plan.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
that
the
whole
controversy
from
the
company's
point
of
view
has
turned
on
their
claim
that
under
this
provision
of
the
contract,
it
was
--
they
were
justified
in
what
they
did.
the
--
at
the
full
usual
administrative
proceedings,
the
board
held
that
in
initiating
this
premium
pay
plan,
the
company
had
refused
to
bargain
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)(5)
and
it
entered
an
order
in
effect
directing
the
company
not
to
institute
such
a
plan
without
first
bargaining
with
the
union
and
if
the
union
were
to
request
it
to
resend
the
particular
plan
that
it
had
inaugurated.
the
board
rejected
the
company's
contention
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
unfair
labor
practice
because
in
order
to
do
so,
it
would
have
to
interpret
the
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
friedman
well
this
would
--
this
mr.
justice
would
present
a
difficult
problem
which
i
will
come
to
the
implication
to
this
in
a
minute
because
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
an
employer
cannot,
without
bargaining
with
the
union
under
section
8
(a)(5)
unilaterally
change
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
friedman
well,
the
union
has
the
right
to
waive
rights
under
the
contract
and
the
question
in
that
case
would
be,
whether
what
was
done
was
sufficient
in
all
the
circumstances
to
constitute
a
waiver.
there
have
been
as
was
suggested
yesterday's
argument
that
the
board's
power
to
deal
with
unfair
labor
practices
under
section
10
(a)
is
not
limited
by
any
other
existing
remedy
and
the
question
would
be
whether
in
all
the
circumstances,
the
--
mr.
friedman
we
don't
think
that
is
in
the
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
friedman
is
that
end
--
well
the
board
wouldn't
think
so.
i
can't
answer
that
question
unequivocally.
mr.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
the
real
issue
was
whether
the
board
has
the
authority
to
interpret
the
contract
that
was
--
mr.
friedman
well,
if
--
mr.
friedman
if
--
if
this
court
would
hold
that
this
provision
of
the
contract
does
not
--
does
permit
this
plan,
i
would
seem
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
but
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
is
--
mr.
friedman
and
then
i'm
coming
back
a
moment
to
what
the
board
held
in
this
case.
it
pointed
out
that
it
has
frequently
interpreted
contracts
in
performing
its
functions
under
the
act
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
proceeding
had
been
invoked
by
the
parties.
there
was
no
pending
arbitration
proceeding
either
before
a
court
or
an
arbitrator
and
therefore
the
reasons
which
sometimes
lead
the
board
to
defer
to
the
tendency
of
another
proceeding
were
not
present
here.
the
board
then
turned,
went
on
an
interpreted
a
particular
contract
and
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
its
examination
of
the
language
of
the
contract
and
the
negotiations
between
the
parties
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision,
this
premium
pay
plan,
was
only
to
give
the
employer
the
right
to
make
individual
merit
increases
for
the
special
competence
of
a
particular
employee
but
not
to
select
a
group
of
employees
and
unilaterally
to
change
the
basic
method
of
compensating
them
from
a
straight
time
basis
to
a
production
basis.
and
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
board
concluded
that
what
had
been
done
by
the
union
in
this
case
did
not
amount
to
a
waiver
on
its
part
of
the
right
to
bargain
about
what
it
called
a
wage
incentive
system.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
it
stated
its
problems,
it
said,
since
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
does
not
turn
entirely
upon
the
provisions
of
the
act.
but
arguably
upon
a
good
faith
dispute
as
to
the
correct
meaning
of
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
board
had
no
jurisdiction
to
proceed
because
it
said,
whether
or
not
this
contract
authorize
what
the
company
had
done,
was
a
matter
to
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator
if
there
was
an
arbitration
provision
or
if
no
such
provision
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
court.
now,
the
answer
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
that
we
and
the
respondent
are
in
common
ground
on
two
general
propositions.
first,
that
the
board
has
no
general
authority
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
secondly,
that
the
mere
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
itself
is
not
enough
to
create
and
give
rise
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
will
we
part
company
with
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
when
it
argues
that
here,
basically
the
unfair
labor
practice
rest
upon
the
breach
of
the
contract.
we
think
that
is
not
the
basis
here.
that
here,
the
unfair
labor
practice
rested
on
the
company's
failure
to
perform
its
duty
to
bargain
with
the
employer
--
with
the
union
before
making
any
material
changes
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
i
think
the
board
stated
its
philosophy
of
the
decision
in
this
case
very
well
at
the
bottom
page
96,
where
it
said
that
in
filing
its
unfair
labor
practice,
the
union
was
complaining
not
of
a
violation
of
its
contract
with
respondent
but
of
the
invasion
of
its
statutory
right
as
collective
bargaining
representative
of
employees
in
the
unit
to
bargain
about
any
changes
in
the
terms
and
condition
of
employment
for
such
employee.
so
as
we
see
the
case
here,
basically,
we
think
it
involves
three
issues.
one,
whether
apart
from
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
what
the
employer
did
here
constituted
is
the
refusal
to
bargain.
two,
whether
the
board
was
authorized
in
itself
interpreting
the
contract
rather
than
leaving
it
to
the
parties
to
go
to
court,
and
three,
whether
in
the
fact
to
this
case,
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
contract
was
proper
one.
now
i'd
like
the
first
turn
of
the
threshold
issue
of
refusal
to
bargain
which
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
respondent
does
not
challenged
here
but
since
this
is
the
keystone
of
the
board's
decision,
i
think
it's
a
accordant
to
deal
with
it
briefly.
the
duty
with
section
8
(a)(5)
imposes
on
an
employer
and
a
union
to
bargain
collectively
is
defined
in
section
8
(d)
as
the
performance
of
the
mutual
obligation
of
the
employer
and
the
union
to
meet
at
reasonable
times
and
confer
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
a
negotiation
of
any
agreement
or
any
question
arising
there
under.
mr.
friedman
well
that
mr.
justice,
the
union
--
it
isn't
that
the
union
is
asking
the
employer
to
bargain
--
our
position
is
that
during
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
the
employer
attempts
unilaterally
without
bargaining
with
the
union
to
make
any
substantial
modifications
in
that
thing,
he
cannot
do
it.
mr.
friedman
that's
right,
but
that
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
is
a
defense
basically.
this
is
something
you
--
mr.
friedman
well,
you
can
mr.
justice
if
they
had
reached
the
bargain.
but
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
what
the
union
agreed
to
in
this
case,
in
effect
gave
the
employer
authority
to
make
this
kind
of
a
change
which
the
employer
says
he
did
have.
and
we
say
that
on
the
circumstances
it
did
not
authorize
the
employer
to
make
a
change.
but
we
further
say
that
in
deciding
whether
there
has
been
a
refusal
to
bargain
here,
the
board
is
authorized
to
examine
the
basis
on
which
the
employer
purported
to
justify
what
he
had
done.
now,
this
as
was
developed
also
during
the
argument
in
the
preceding
case
the
duty
of
the
bargaining
we
think
clearly
is
not
limited
just
to
working
out
the
initial
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
continues
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
now,
four
years
ago
in
the
katz
case,
this
court
held
that
where
during
negotiations,
an
employer
unilaterally
and
without
consulting
with
the
union,
made
significant
changes
in
the
rights
of
pay
in
sick
leave,
that
that
constituted
a
refusal
to
bargain
without
regard
to
the
employer's
good
faith.
and
as
i
put
it
in
so
holding
that
such
unilateral
changes
said,
frustrates
the
objectives
of
section
8(a)(5)
much
as
does
a
flat
refusal
to
negotiate
at
all.
and
we
think
the
same
reasoning
requires
that
during
the
term
of
a
collective
agreement,
after
the
agreement
has
been
added
on
into,
similarly,
neither
side
can
make
unilateral
changes
without
conferring
with
the
other.
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
whole
concept
of
requiring
collective
bargaining
embodied
in
8(a)(5),
is
that
industrial
peace
will
be
furthered.
if
the
parties
to
a
contract
before
making
changes
get
together
and
talk
about
it,
they
don't
have
to
reach
agreement
that's
explicit
in
the
statute.
but
we
think
they
do
have
to
get
together
and
talk
about
it
and
therefore,
the
philosophy
of
the
statute
is
neither
side
can
make
significant
changes
in
the
basic
employment
relationship,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
without
first
considering,
without
first
consulting
and
discussing
it
with
the
other
side.
now
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
very
clearly
that
the
change
that
the
employer
made
was
a
significant
change.
under
the
contract,
does
it
previously
existed
--
mr.
friedman
well,
let
me
--
i'm
going
to
have
to
answer
your
--
answer
you
mr.
justice
in
two
stages.
the
order
in
this
case,
the
only
unfair
labor
practice
found
in
this
case
was
the
refusal
to
bargain.
and
of
course,
the
whole
--
i
think
the
whole
theory
of
it
is,
if
the
employer
had
said
to
the
union,
“we
now
propose
to
institute
this
plan
and
if
you'd
like
to
discuss
it,
fine.”
in
the
course
of
the
discussion,
there
may
have
been
some
changes.
the
union
might
have
been
able
to
talk
the
employer
out
of
it.
mr.
friedman
well
then
it's
--
mr.
friedman
then
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
--
then
the
employer
has
satisfied
his
duty
under
this
order
to
bargain.
that's
what
--
mr.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
friedman
in
this
case,
what
happened
was,
the
employer
without
consulting
with
the
union
inaugurated
this
plan.
then
they
met
after
the
plan
had
been
inaugurated
and
the
union
tried
to
get
them
to
resend
it
and
the
employer
said,
“no,
we
think
we
are
authorized
by
the
contract.”
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
very
great
difference
between
bargaining
between
the
parties
before
you
do
something
and
bargaining
after
it
has
been
done
and
attempt
to
resend
it.
mr.
friedman
that
is
correct
under
this
case.
now
i
have
to
in
all
candor
state
that
since
this
decision,
the
board
has
gone
somewhat
beyond
the
position
has
taken
here,
in
the
c
and
s
case,
which
we
sided
into
our
brief
--
the
board
is
going
beyond
this
and
they
said
that
in
this
situation
section
8(d)
of
the
act,
precludes
the
employer
for
making
even
a
unilateral
change
after
bargain,
they
construe
section
8(d)
is
saying
that
during
the
term
of
a
contract,
an
employer
has
no
right
to
modified
in
significant
respect
so
that
under
that
decision,
a
broader
order
would
have
been
independent
than
in
this
case.
but
in
this
case,
the
board
did
not
go
that
far
and
at
the
present
time,
quite
frankly,
the
board's
thinking
in
this,
on
this
subject
is
in
a
developing
area.
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
as
far
as
this
order
is
concerned,
all
of
this
order
requires
the
company
to
do
is
to
bargain
with
the
employee
--
with
the
union
before
inaugurating
this
plan.
now
i
like
to
come
back
to
a
minute
to
the
significance
of
the
change
that
was
made
here,
because
i
think
this
is
very
critical.
before
this
provision
have
been
inaugurated,
each
member
of
this
crew
received
a
different
wage
with
presumably
reflected
the
varying
skills,
range
from
$2.14
or
$2.15
to
$2.29,
and
the
record
shows,
this
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
very
carefully
put
out
in
the
negotiations.
under
this
plan,
the
distinctions
between
the
different
members
of
the
union
have
been
abandoned.
what
happens
is,
once
the
“glue
spreader”
crew
exceeds
the
production
standard
set
here,
every
member
gets
$2.50.
the
lowest
paid
man
who
used
to
get
to
$2.15
gets
$2
and
a
half.
the
highest
paid
man
who
used
to
get
$2.29
gets
$2
and
a
half.
if
in
fact,
there's
one
man
of
this
four-member
crew
who
is
inefficient,
but
despite
that
the
other
three
members
are
so
efficient
that
they
can
manage
to
achieve
the
production
quota,
they
all
four
get
the
$2
and
a
half.
now
--
mr.
friedman
this
goes
mr.
friedman
this
goes
to
the
merit
but
also
i
was
also
tending
to
show
that
the
change
that
was
made
here
was
a
very
significant
change.
it
wasn't
just
a
minor
adjustment.
it
was
a
basic
change
in
the
way
on
which
wage
is
calculated.
mr.
friedman
yes,
that's
correct.
and
this
brings
me
mr.
justice
if
may
discuss
that
in
the
context
of
why
we
think
the
board
in
this
kind
of
a
case
does
have
authority
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
won't
labor
because
it
was
discussed
considerably
yesterday
the
statutory
language
itself
in
section
10
(a)
which
provides
that
the
board's
power
to
deal
with
unfair
labor
practices
should
not
be
in
any
way
affected
by
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
established
by
agreement
law
or
otherwise
because
it
seems
very
clear
to
us
that
if
the
board
is
not
authorized
to
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
when
it
comes
to
pass
on
an
unfair
labor
practice,
its
power
to
prevent
such
practices
would
be
affected.
for
one
thing,
it's
just
a
matter
of
the
time
it
takes.
the
parties
have
to
first
go
and
institute
a
lawsuit.
it's
bound
to
take
a
lot
longer
than
the
board
the
proceeding.
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
this
but
said,
it
didn't
think
that
made
any
difference.
it's
also
significant
we
think
that
this
proviso
of
the
section
10
(a)
was
part
of
the
original
wagner
act
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
labor
management
act,
congress
consciously
decided
to
retain
this
provision.
and
in
so
doing,
it
stated
that
the
remedies
before
the
board
to
deal
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
were
intended
to
be
in
addition
to
and
not
in
lieu
of
with
other
--
what
other
remedies
might
be
available
in
another
forum.
mr.
friedman
10
(a)?
mr.
friedman
i
don't
remember
any
case
on
that
mr.
justice.
now,
coming
to
the
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
i
stand
corrected.
in
some
of
the
preemption
cases,
i
think
the
court
has
talked
about
that
proviso
(voice
overlap).
mr.
friedman
i
think
so
mr.
justice
and
also
i
think
in
carey-westinghouse.
and
i
think
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
did
indicate
that
the
existence
of
the
judicial
remedy
would
not
oust
the
board
of
its
jurisdiction.
now,
i'd
like
to
also
comment.
therefore,
it
seems
in
the
light
of
this
that
the
board
should
not
be
deemed
to
be
precluded
from
dealing
with
this
matter,
unless
to
a
very
strong
policy
considerations
which
dictated
in
favor
of
giving
exclusive
authority
in
this
area
to
the
court.
so
we
think
the
policy
considerations,
not
only
don't
reached
that
result,
but
affirmatively
support
to
the
board's
jurisdiction.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
power
--
as
a
matter
of
power,
i
don't
think
the
board
--
mr.
friedman
no,
i'm
afraid
i
don't.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
we'll
allow
to
deference
mr.
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
when
we're
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
problem,
the
board's
expertise
should
be
given
great
weight.
let
me
see
if
i
could
explain
that
position
to
you.
mr.
friedman
this
is
independently
of
the
10
(a)
argument.
there
is
the
fact
of
course
that
i
don't
know
all
the
details
of
the
power
act.
so
i
don't
believe
if
it's
anything
comparable.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe.
but
in
determining
that
the
question,
the
ultimate
question
in
terms
of
interpreting
the
contract,
is
whether
when
the
union
agreed
that
the
employer
could
have
the
right
to
pay
a
premium
pay
over
and
above
the
contractual
classified
rate
to
award
any
employee.
the
question
in
that
instance
is
whether
this
authorized
them
to
inaugurate
a
plan
covering
groups
of
employees,
changing
the
basis
or
merely
to
single
out
a
particular
employee
and
say,
“you
employee
brown,
you
are
very
skilled.
we're
going
to
pay
you
not
$2.25
but
$2.40.”
as
i
might
add,
there
was
an
instance,
there
was
one
employee
that
the
record
shows,
but
why
at
the
time
of
this
--
time
for
this
negotiation
was
being
paid
the
premium
rate.
he
was
getting
$2.40
although
the
contract
was
$2.29.
now,
we
would
suggest
that
in
answering
that
question,
it's
not
enough
just
to
look
at
the
particular
terms
of
the
contract
when
what
you're
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
in
doing
this
thing,
the
employer
has
violated
his
duty
to
bargain.
because
the
whole
question
it
seems
to
us
is
so
intertwined
with
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
with
the
federal
labor
policy.
that
to
answer
this
question
calls
to
something
more
than
just
the
kind
of
analysis
that
a
court
would
traditionally
make
in
interpreting
the
contract.
they
come
into
play
--
it
comes
into
play
for
example,
the
well-settled
rule
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
upheld,
that
a
waiver
of
statutory
rights
will
not
be
implied
unless
it
is
clearly
and
unquestionably
set
forth.
now,
we
have
here
a
history
of
bargaining
negotiations
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
and
in
the
course
of
these
negotiations
on
one
or
two
occasions,
some
reference
was
made
to
the
employer
considering
the
inauguration
of
a
premium
paid
plan
for
the
“glue
spreader”
crew.
there's
nothing
--
and
one
of
the
instance
the
union
said,
nothing
on
the
other
instance
when
the
employer
referred
to
the
fact
that
another
company
in
the
area
had
proposed
such
a
plan
but
had
withdrawn
it
when
that
union
objected,
the
union
representative
said
they
couldn't
agree
to
such
a
thing.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
where
it
is
necessary
to
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
there
has
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
in
carrying
out
its
statutory
duties
to
determine
unfair
labor
practices
made
to
that
extent
interprets
the
contract.
mr.
friedman
that's
right.
there
may
be
many
situations
where
the
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
will
give
rise
both
to
a
possible
action
of
breach
of
contract
and
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
of
course
the
board
--
this
is
not
the
only
area
where
the
board
has
to
interpret
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
--
mr.
friedman
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
as
i
say,
that
the
board
for
example,
that
there
are
certain
portions
of
the
statute
where
the
mere
entering
into
of
a
particular
type
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
unfair
labor
practice.
such
as
entering
to
a
hot
cargo
bringing
all
aboard
there,
it's
never
been
suggested
to
our
knowledge
that
when
it's
charged
to
the
particular
contract
is
a
violation
of
the
hot
cargo
provision,
that
it's
necessary
for
the
board
to
defer.
similarly
when
on
the
board
has
to
determine
a
dispute
--
a
representation
dispute
on
the
10(a),
it
traditionally
interprets
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
friedman
well
i
think
--
mr.
friedman
i
think
there
mr.
justice
we
would
say
that
the
congress
in
an
act
in
301
intended
to
open
up
broadly
the
federal
courts
and
this
court's
decisions
i
think
in
the
preemption
case
have
indicated
that
this
--
mr.
friedman
well
the
congress
--
mr.
friedman
--
congress
in
those
situations
mr.
justice
i
suggest
was
not
addressing
itself
to
the
problem
of
the
board's
authority
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practice
as
it
was
addressing
itself
to
the
question
of
what
remedy
is
the
best
--
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
in
this
situation
the
board's
interpretation
should
be
given
very
substantial
deference
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
friedman
no,
we
support
in
fact
the
government
urge
--
mr.
friedman
well
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
justice,
it's
consistent
because
there
are
different
problems
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
301
suit,
in
the
301
suit
--
mr.
friedman
well
i
would
--
perhaps
mr.
justice,
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was
that
in
the
301
suit
the
issue
is
framed
in
the
court
ordinarily
in
a
much
narrower
context
than
before
the
board.
i
was
suggesting,
the
board's
expertise
is
important
in
this
area
because
the
question
of
contract
instruction
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
tied
in
with
the
question
of
statutory
violation
whereas
in
the
301
suit,
it's
ordinarily
only
the
question
contract
interpretation.
mr.
friedman
i
would
think
it
may
have
been.
i
would
think
it
probably
was.
mr.
friedman
well,
but
mr.
justice
if
i
may
come
back
in
such
a
suit
by
the
union,
the
only
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
contract
authorizes,
who
wouldn't
get
to
the
--
any
questions
as
to
whether
the
question
of
suggestion
go
way
with
the
statutory
rights,
you
wouldn't
have
to
get-in
in
the
301
suit
to
the
problem
of
whether
there
was
a
refusal
to
bargain.
whereas
it
seems
to
me
the
board's
expertise
comes
into
play
in
evaluating
the
contract
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
policies
reflected
in
the
labor
act.
