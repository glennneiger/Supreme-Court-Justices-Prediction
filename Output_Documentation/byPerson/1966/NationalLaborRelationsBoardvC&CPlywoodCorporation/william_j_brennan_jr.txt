mr.
friedman,
have
we
had
occasion
to
interpret
10
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

here.
have
we
in
this
court
had
occasion
in
other
cases
that
refer
to
10
(a)?
i
don't
remember
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
mr.
friedman
in
response
to
justice
white's
question
that
if
the
court
interpreted
this
provision
as
the
company
interprets
it,
that
this
nevertheless
was
not
preclude
the
board
from
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
remember
that,
it's
not
the
court,
the
same
agency
--
remember
the
texas
gas
transmission
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
was
involved
with
federal
power
commission
in
363,
where
we
held
with
the
--
an
interpretation
of
an
agreement
by
the
federal
power
commission
was
not
to
be
regarded
as
something
within
its
expertise
so
called.
now,
the
courts
are
indeed
better
equipped
to
interpret
the
agreement
by
traditional
principles
in
interpretation
in
our
agencies.
and
in
consequence,
the
federal
power
commission
did
not
rely
on
the
principle
that
the
--
its
interpretation
came
within
that
special
expertise
--
the
deference
expertise,
of
course
sort
of
prior
to
give
the
agency.
do
we
have
anything
like
that
involved
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
is
independently
of
the
10(a)
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
i
recall
that
there
was
any
comparable
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
seems
you
haven't
mentioned
the
section
10
(a)
yet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that's
also
been
in
the
statute
since
the
wagner
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
does
say
that
the
board
has
certain
power
irrespective
of
any
agreement
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
very
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
your
position,
it's
not
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
10(a)
--
10(a)
certainly
contemplates,
it
does
it?
that
the
board
shall
have
certain
power
to
deal
with
situations
like
this
irrespective
of
the
existence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
point
is,
surely
10
(a)
contemplates
that
even
when
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
been
breached,
that
there
may
be
unfair
labor
practices.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
agreement.
but
why
does
it
dismiss
that
case?
