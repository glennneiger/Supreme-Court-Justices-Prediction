mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
decision
rendered
on
june
12th
1964,
the
federal
trade
commission
found
that
universal-rundle
corporation,
a
manufacturer
of
cast-iron
and
victor's
china
fixtures
had
violated
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
by
granting
a
discount
averaging
10%
on
plumbing
fixtures
sold
under
respondent's
brand
name
in
truckload
quantities.
the
commission
ruled
that
such
discounts
may
adversely
affect
competition
on
the
buyer
level
since
the
truckload
quantities
were
deemed
by
the
commission
to
be
beyond
the
buying
capabilities
of
certain
of
respondent's
customers
who
competed
with
a
customer
buying
in
truckload
quantities.
on
july
20th,
1964,
universal-rundle
requested
the
commission
to
stay
the
effective
date
of
the
order
for
at
least
18
months
and
within
that
period
of
time
for
the
commission
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
truckload
discount
practices
of
respondent's
six
principal
competitors.
in
requesting
this
stay,
universal-rundle
brought
the
following
matters
to
the
attention
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
first;
the
commission
was
furnished
with
each
of
respondents
six
major
competitor's
price-list
and
price
bulletins
showing
that
plumbing
fixtures
purchased
in
truckload
quantities
were
priced
not
10%
but
approximately
18%
below
the
price
paid
for
identical
fixtures
by
those
competitor's
customers
in
less
than
truckload
quantity.
the
commission
was
advised
if
the
company
sale
with
universal-rundle
branded
fixtures
accounted
for
approximately
5%
or
precisely
5.75%
of
the
total
industry
sales.
with
this
market
share
being
one
of
the
smallest
in
the
industry,
while
four
of
respondent's
competitors'
sales
accounted
for
66%
of
the
total
industry
sales.
the
leading
manufacturer's
share
and
a
manufacturer
who
were
shown
to
be
granting
a
truckload
discount
of
18%,
his
--
that
company's
share
of
the
market
was
32%
and
the
second
breaking
manufacturer's
share
of
the
market
was
15%.
the
commission
was
informed
by
universal-rundle
that
it
had
incurred
substantial
losses
during
each
of
three
years
immediately
preceding
the
entry
of
the
commission's
order
to
cease-and-desist.
these
losses
amounted
to
over
one-half
million
dollars,
during
each
of
the
three
years.
the
ftc's
attention
was
invited
to
publish
by
native
data
showing
the
substantial
profits
of
its
six
principal
competitors.
in
an
affidavit
by
its
vice-president
in
charged
of
marketing,
the
company
predicted
that
an
immediate
entry
of
the
cease-and-desist
order
against
universal-rundle
for
engaging
in
an
industry-wide
practice
without
the
ftc
taking
some
action
to
correct
this
industry-wide
practice
of
granting
truckload
discounts
would
have
the
direct
result
of
substantially
decreasing
its
sales
volume
which
would
then
be
taken
over
by
its
large
competitors
who
were
free
to
continue
to
engage
in
the
same
practice
of
granting
truckload
discounts.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
we
alleged
mr.
justice
warren
that
the
--
that
the
discounts
that
the
competitors
granted
were
done
in
the
same
manner
as
universal-rundle
granted
its
discounts.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
that
is
our
contention,
yes
sir.
on
august
4th,
the
federal
trade
commission
refused
to
stay
the
effective
date
of
the
cease-and-desist
order
holding
that
our
showing
was
insufficient
to
warrant
any
such
action.
furthermore,
the
commission
in
denying
the
stay
took
the
position
that
our
showing
concerning
its
competitor's
truckload
discounts
was
not
sufficient
for
the
commission
to
undertake
any
investigation
of
any
of
the
competitors.
in
short,
the
ftc
refused
to
take
any
action
in
the
plumbing
fixture
industry
except
to
insist
that
an
immediate
order
be
entered
against
universal-rundle
corporation
for
granting
a
10%
truckload
discount
while
its
competitors
were
not
even
to
be
subjected
to
an
ftc
investigation
for
offering
truckload
discounts
averaging
18%.
following
a
series
of
correspondence
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
--
we
claim
sir
and
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
harlan
agreed
with
this
that
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
--
when
it
refused
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir,
i
don't
say
that
they
--
i
will
not
charge
them
with
bad
faith,
no
mr.
harlan.
following
a
series
of
correspondence
between
complaint
counsel
for
the
commission
and
universal-rundle's
counsel
which
appears
as
appendix
d
to
the
governments
brief,
and
after
names
of
customers
for
two
of
the
largest
manufacturers
had
been
furnished
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
commission
in
april
of
1965,
advised
respondents
counsel
that
it
would
not
then
undertake
an
investigation
of
universal-rundle's
two
largest
competitor
because
such
an
investigation
might
conflict
with
the
pending
investigation
by
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
by
the
time
this
case
reached
the
court
of
appeals,
the
ftc
acknowledged
in
its
brief,
filed
in
that
court,
that
the
customer
information
which
we
had
furnished
to
the
commission
tended
to
show
current
violations
of
section
2
(a)
by
the
two
largest
competitors,
namely
american
radiator
and
kohler
company.
the
court
of
appeals
in
setting
aside
the
commission's
order
held
that
universal-rundle
had
made
a
strong
showing
that
its
competitors
were
engaged
in
the
same
practice
as
found
to
be
illegal
when
done
by
respondent.
the
court
held
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
ftc's
refusal
to
even
make
an
investigation
and
that
is
the
significant
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission's
refusal
to
even
undertake
an
investigation
of
our
relatively
few
competitors
who
were
granting
higher
discounts
was
a
patent
abuse
of
the
commission's
administrative
discretion.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
that's
correct
mr.
warren,
they
did
not.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
the
court
of
appeals
merely
held
mr.
warren
that
we
had
made
a
sufficient
showing
to
the
point
that
the
commission
should
have
undertaken
an
investigation
of
our
competitors
to
see
whether
or
not
the
commission
should
issue
a
complaint
or
take
some
action
with
respect
to
its
competitors.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
yes,
mr.
warren,
they
did
it.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
they
--
they
did
not
go
to
the
merits
mr.
justice
warren.
they
--
they
merely
held
that
we
had
furnished
sufficient
showings
so
that
the
commission
should
have
undertaken
some
type
of
investigation.
if
you
assert,
it's
--
it's
similarly
to
when
the
federal
trade
commission
decides
in
any
industry-wide
investigation.
when
the
commission
undertakes
an
industry-wide
investigation,
the
commission
does
not
first
pick
out
a
guinea
pig
and
issue
a
complaint
and
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
against
that
company
before
proceeding
on
an
industry-wide
basis.
what
the
court
held
was
in
essence
if
you
would
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
held
that
we
had
shown
the
commission
or
given
the
commission
sufficient
information
so
that
the
commission
should
have
been
followed
its
announced
enforcement
policies
and
undertaken
an
industry-wide
investigation
of
the
plumbing
fixture
industry.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
mr.
justice
fortas,
certainly
the
court
left
the
commission
free
to
decide
how
they
wanted
to
undertake
an
investigation
and
what
the
commission
wanted
to
do
after
they
did
conduct
that
investigation
in
the
plumbing
fixture
industry.
the
commission
was
free
to
do
anything
it
sought
that
after
a
conducted
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir.
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
been
unable
mr.
justice
fortas
to
find
a
precedent
or
a
case
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
it
was
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
commission's
refusal
to
either
stay
the
order
or
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
industry-wide
practice
of
grating
truckload
discounts
was
inconsistent
with
the
overriding
policy
of
the
amended
clayton
act.
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
pendency
of
the
department
of
justice
proceeding
did
not
serve
to
excuse
the
commission's
refusal
to
investigate.
the
basic
question
as
i
see
it
presented
to
this
court
for
decision
is
whether
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
agency
charged
by
the
congress
with
the
primary
responsibility
for
enforcement
of
the
robinson-patman
act
acted
arbitrarily
in
an
abuse
of
its
discretion
when
it
chose
to
ignore
the
pricing
practices
of
universal-rundle's
competitors
yet
insisted
that
an
immediate
order
be
entered
against
that
company
and
that
company
alone
for
engaging
in
the
same
pricing
practice.
we
have
set
forth
three
reasons
in
our
brief
why
we
think
the
commission
committed
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
industry.
briefly
summarized
they
are
as
follows.
the
court
below
was
unable
to
detect
how
enforcement
of
this
order
against
universal-rundle
corporation
coupled
with
an
ftc
flat
refusal
to
investigate
any
other
plumbing
fixture
manufacturer
would
be
in
conformity
with
the
statutory
objectives
of
congress
in
enacting
to
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
congress
was
placing
its
trust
in
the
ftc
that
it
would
not
enforce
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
lessen
or
impair
competition
at
any
distributional
level.
it
is
our
position
that
the
ftc
in
taking
the
action
it
did
in
this
case,
failed
to
consider
how
it's
refusal
to
investigate
any
the
other
manufacturer's
truckload
discounts
could
only
contribute
to
a
further
increase
in
the
high
degree
of
concentration
shown
to
exist
in
this
industry.
yet,
entry
of
an
order
against
universal-rundle
would
not
benefit
any
of
universal-rundle's
customers.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
interpret
the
commission's
statement
of
august
4th,
1964
mr.
justice
harlan
as
they
may
refuse,
they
would
refuse
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
construed
the
commission
is
saying
that
in
its
statement
of
august
4th,
1964,
yes
mr.
harlan.
and
i
think
if
there
was
any
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
commission
would
undertake
an
investigation,
i
point
the
court's
attention
to
the
series
of
correspondence
that
i
had
with
the
complaint
counsel
following
the
commisi
--
commission's
denial
of
our
stay.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
it
appears
at
--
as
appendix
c
to
the
government's
brief.
to
comply
with
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
page
62
and
63
of
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
--
transcript
of
the
record,
yes
sir.
to
comply
with
the
order,
universal-rundle
has
only
two
practical
choices.
the
company
could
eliminate
truckload
discounts
or
it
could
terminate
those
customers
the
ftc
deems
incapable
of
buying
in
such
quantities.
if
it
made
the
first
choice
that
is
if
it
eliminated
truckload
discounts,
the
company's
smaller
customers
would
still
be
competing
in
the
marketplace
with
other
manufacturer's
customers
who
continue
to
receive
the
price
concessions
on
truckload
quantities.
since
it
is
obvious
i
submit
that
a
company
who's
share
of
the
market
is
a
small
as
universal-rundle's
is
in
no
position
to
be
a
setter
of
marketing
business,
be
a
setter
of
policy
with
effective
prices
in
this
industry.
and
for
this
reason,
elimination
of
truckload
discounts
would
not
affect
the
pricing
practices
of
the
large
manufacturers
such
as
american
standard,
kohler
and
the
other
companies
mentioned
in
our
petition
for
a
stay.
universal-rundle's
smaller
customers,
under
these
circumstances
would
be
in
no
better
competitive
position
as
a
result
of
the
ftc's
order.
if
universal-rundle
chose
the
second
method
and
terminated
customers
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantity,
these
customers
undoubtedly
would
continue
to
purchase
plumbing
fixtures
at
the
higher
discriminatory
price
from
one
or
more
of
respondent's
competitors.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
quite
apparent
we
submit
that
immediate
entry
of
the
order
against
universal-rundle
would
not
make
the
adverse
effect
on
the
buyer
level
of
competition
since
the
terminating
customers
would
still
be
buying
in
less
than
truckload
quantity
from
a
competitor
of
ur
--
universal-rundle
and
at
a
higher
discriminatory
price.
on
the
other
hand,
regardless
of
which
of
the
two
methods
are
taken
by
universal-rundle
to
comply
with
the
ftc's
cease-and-desist
order,
it's
market
share
could
only
be
decreased
and
it's
last
buyers
would
shift
from
un
--
was
last
buyers
would
shift
from
universal-rundle
to
the
competitors
who
have
larger
market
shares
and
who
are
free
to
continue
to
engage
in
the
industry's
wide
practice.
the
second
reason
we
contend
as
to
why
the
ftc
abused
its
discretion
in
this
proceeding
is
that
it
failed
to
heed
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
moog
industries
inc.
versus
the
ftc
reported
at
355
u.s.
411.
on
page
413
of
the
moog
decision,
this
court
stated
as
follows.
“although
an
allegedly
illegal
practice
may
appear
to
be
operative
throughout
an
industry,
whether
such
appearances
reflect
facts
and
whether
all
firms
in
an
industry
should
be
dealt
with
in
a
single
proceeding
or
should
receive
individualized
treatment,
our
questions
that
call
for
discretionary
determinations
by
the
administrative
agency,”
end
of
the
statement
from
the
moog
decision.
we
submit
that
in
moog,
this
court
concluded
that
before
the
ftc
exercised
its
discretion
in
determining
whether
it's
a
cease
and
des
--
enter
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
against
one
company,
the
commission
should
have
made
some
effort
to
find
out
whether
the
alleged
--
allegedly
illegal
practice
is
in
fact
industry-wide
in
scope.
here,
when
the
ftc
was
confronted
with
document
showing
that
respondent's
competitors
were
granting
truckload
discounts
of
approximately
18%,
here
where
in
this
very
record
that
we've
shown,
five
of
the
seven
non-truckload
customers
of
respondent
also
purchased
from
one
or
more
of
the
other
manufacturers,
here,
where
the
ftc
found
that
a
discount
averaging
10%
may
lessen
the
competition
in
an
industry
in
which
price
competition
was
intense.
the
ftc
flatly
refused
to
take
any
action
to
obtain
the
very
type
of
information
which
this
court
in
moog
has
held
it
should
have
had
to
make
an
informed
decision
as
to
the
most
efficacious
method
of
enforcing
the
law.
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
in
moog
was
whether
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
should
go
into
effect
against
one
company
before
the
time
other
competitors
who
were
already
being
prosecuted
or
investigated
were
brought
under
similar
orders.
this
court
in
effect
held
that
the
commission
was
the
master
of
its
own
timetable
insofar
as
entry
of
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
was
concerned.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
this
court
in
moog
did
not
condone
or
sanctioned
a
flat
refusal
by
the
ftc
to
ignore
industry-wide
violations
as
it
has
done
in
the
plumbing
fixture
industries.
universal-rundle
has
not
asked
that
its
order
be
stayed
until
similar
orders
are
entered
against
one
or
more
of
its
competitors.
all
the
company
ask
is
the
ftc
to
investigate
its
competitors
and
after
such
an
investigation
for
it
then
can
determine
whether
the
best
enforcement
policy
is
to
invoke
its
adjudicatory
processes
to
obtain
compliance
in
this
industry.
and
if
so,
whether
an
order
should
be
entered
against
universal-rundle
immediately
or
whether
other
methods
such
as
the
issuance
of
guides,
trade
regulation
rules,
assurances
of
voluntary
compliance
from
each
one
of
the
manufacturers,
would
be
the
most
expeditious
and
effective
meth
--
effective
method
of
obtaining
industry-wide
compliance.
the
third
reason
why
the
ftc's
action
in
this
proceeding
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
that
in
issuing
an
order
against
respondent
and
refusing
to
even
investigate
its
competitors
that
commission
departed
from
its
own
announced
enforcement
policy.
the
federal
trade
commission
has
officially
reported
to
the
congress
in
its
annual
report
for
1964
and
i
quote
from
page
1
of
that
report,
“whenever
a
law
violation
was
identified,
the
commission
instead
of
applying
the
simple
and
superficially
vigorous
method
of
hoping
individual
violators
undertook
to
find
out
if
their
competitors
were
doing
likewise.
if
they
were,
the
commission
then
decided
how
best
this
competitively
generated
evil
could
be
eliminated
with
the
least
delay”
of
what
the
commission
has
told
the
congress
is
its
enforcement
policy.
the
commission
has
elaborated
on
this
policy
in
testimony
before
the
house
appropriations
subcommittee
which
is
reported
at
408
and
409
of
hearings
before
subcommittee
app
--
appropriations
of
the
independent
offices
89th
congress
first
session
and
i
quote
from
the
chairman's
testimony
of
the
commission
to
the
subcommittee
on
appropriations
of
the
congress.
“we
have
given
a
mandate
to
our
enforcement
bureaus,
instead
of
taking
these
cases
at
as
they
come,
one
by
one,
the
first
thing
they
are
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
this
is
an
isolated
situation
that
has
come
to
our
attention
or
whether
it
is
something
that
is
engaged
in
competitively
by
all
competitors.
if
so,
to
step
back
and
then
with
our
resources,
engage
in
what
i
would
hope
to
be
some
basic
planning
and
determine
what
would
be
the
best
tool
and
approach
for
us
to
take.”
i'm
still
quoting
from
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
“historically,
the
commission
was
wedded
to
the
procedure
of
taking
our
customers
or
their
cases
as
they
came.
the
commission
had
hoped
that
with
the
tools
that
congress
had
afforded
the
commission
to
work
with
that
even
on
a
case
by
case
method
that
proceeding
against
one,
the
others
if
it
affected
them,
would
take
notice
and
follow
suit,
it
just
didn't
worked
that
way.”
it
could
be
said,”
said
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
“in
all
fairness
to
these
people
that
if
there
were
50
engaged
in
the
same
practice,
what
certainty
would
a
party
have
that
if
they
stopped,
the
other
49
would
stop.
in
our
country,
very
rarely
can
a
man
be
his
'brother's
keeper.
i
think
this
is
the
basis
of
the
law.
we
are
trying
to
enforce
our
law
in
the
american
way
equitably
and
fairly.”
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation
of
the
testimony
by
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
before
the
house
appropriation
committee.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
commission's
action
in
this
proceeding
is
diametrically
opposed
to
and
in
conflict
with
the
above
quoted
enforcement
policy
of
this
agency.
here,
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
has
told
a
congressional
committee
that
at
every
instance
when
it
identified
the
law
of
violation,
its
staff
is
under
specific
instructions
to
find
out
if
competitors
are
engaged
in
the
same
practice.
now,
once
it
is
determined
that
the
practice
is
industry-wide,
then
and
only
then
according
to
the
commission
statements
to
the
congress
does
the
commission
decides
the
best
important
method
to
eliminate
the
illegality.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
this
was
a
justification
of
commission's
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
1965.
in
short,
this
announced
enforcement
policy
which
the
commission
refuses
to
follow
in
this
proceeding
suggests
that
the
ftc
has
interpreted
the
moog
decision
in
precisely
the
same
manner
in
which
respondent
has
urged
in
its
arguments
before
this
court.
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
has
candidly
stated
on
several
occasions
why
this
enforcement
policy
has
been
undertaken
by
the
commission.
he
stated
in
a
speech
on
june
16th,
1965,
that
may
add
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
copies
of
all
of
the
speeches
that
we
have
referred
to
in
our
briefs
had
been
filed
with
the
clerk,
that
the
policy
according
to
the
chairman,
that
the
policy
reported
by
the
commission
to
the
congress
quotes,
“gives
all
violators
an
opportunity
to
rid
themselves
of
the
illegalities
simultaneously
without
suffering
competitive
injury
in
the
process.”
the
chairman
has
summed
up
in
a
few
precise
words
the
rational
of
the
lower
court's
relief
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
dickson
who
astutely
observed
“the
man
who
is
willing
to
comply
with
the
law
simply
can't
afford
to
if
the
competitor
is
allowed
to
go
on
violating
it.”
no
explanation
was
given
by
the
federal
trade
commission
for
deviating
from
its
announced
enforcement
policy
in
the
proceeding
against
the
universal-rundle
at
the
time
the
agency
refused
to
grant
the
stay
of
its
order.
in
this
court,
the
ftc
claims
that
an
industry-wide
approach
was
not
appropriate
because
the
truckload
discount
practices
of
respondents
were
and
i
quote
from
page
12
of
the
reply
brief
“ancillary
to
the
main
case
involving
discriminations
in
favor
of
sears,
roebuck
and
company.
the
ftc
however
ruled
that
that
company's
prices
to
sears,
roebuck
were
not
in
violation
of
the
act.”
i
submit
that
the
ftc's
characterization
of
the
truckload
discount
practices
as
inquiry
to
its
main
case
is
in
effect
an
admission
that
no
complaint
would
have
been
issued
if
the
company's
prices
to
sears
had
not
been
challenged.
if
this
is
correct,
there
would
appear
to
be
no
reason
for
the
commission
to
have
entered
an
order
against
the
company
unless
it
was
at
that
time
ready
to
undertake
an
industry-wide
investigation
of
the
truckload
discount
practices
of
other
manufacturers
in
the
industry
which
of
course
it
refused
to
do.
in
denying
the
stay
in
august
of
1964
and
refusing
to
take
any
action
with
respect
to
the
other
manufacturer's
discount,
the
commission,
i
submit,
has
done
exactly
and
precisely
what
the
federal
trade
commission
and
its
chairman
have
labeled
as
both
“on
bear
to
the
sole
company
who
is
prosecuted
and
is,”
and
i
quote
again,
“a
superficial
method
of
enforcing
the
law.”
this
court,
we
respectfully
submit,
should
not
reverse
the
lower
court's
decision
in
the
instant
case
since
the
decision
is
in
conformity
with
the
announced
enforcement
policies
of
the
commission.
i
submit
a
reversal
would
be
tantamount
to
this
court
encouraging
the
ftc
to
proceed,
to
enforce
the
law
in
a
manner
which
that
very
agency
has
and
no
in
certain
terms
described
as
unfair
and
in
conflict
with
the
original
purpose
of
the
commission
of
guiding
the
business
without
bringing
down
upon
it
the
menace
of
the
law.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
page
62?
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
they
go
on
on
page
63,
and
they
set
forth
the
type
of
information
which
they
say
is
necessary
before
they
would
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
manufacturer's
truckload
discounts.
they
state
there
that
while
the
practice
of
granting
a
discount
may
under
certain
circumstances
such
as
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
at
page
63.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
the
second
--
the
second
line
is
while
the
practice
of
granting
such
discount
may
under
certain
circumstances
such
as
--
such
as
those
shown
in
this
record
of
this
proceeding
result
in
price
discriminations
having
prescribed
competitive
effect,
the
practice
is
not
necessarily
illegal
as
indicated
in
respondent's
petition.
then
they
go
on
to
add
all
of
the
various
elements
that
they
think
would
be
necessary
in
order
for
the
commission
to
undertake
an
investigation.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
is
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion
for
it
to
refuse
to
undertake
the
investigation
of
the
respondent's
competitor.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
sir,
we
gave
--
sir
we
gave
them
all
of
the
information
that
we
had
in
our
possession
with
respect
to
the
competitor's
truckload
discounts.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
think,
mr.
white,
mr.
justice
white
that
certainly
based
on
the
information
that
we
showed
to
the
commission,
the
commission
should
have
undertaken
an
investigation.
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
white
that
just
merely
to
come
in
and
say
it
is
an
industry-wide
practice
that
therefore,
the
commission
should
go
ahead
and
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
whole
industry,
but
we
did
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
aback
that
these
six
manufacturers,
competing
manufacturers
of
the
universal-rundle
were
in
fact
granting
a
higher
truckload
discount
if
you
would
please,
and
was
involved
in
a
proceeding
against
universal-rundle
corporation.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
if
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
had
said
that
and
in
doing
that,
the
commission
had
decided
that
we
would
not
have
been
competitively
injured,
i
could
not
quarrel
with
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
would
think
mr.
justice
white
that
if
the
commission
is
going
to
follow
his
announced
enforcement
policy
that
it
would
not
knowingly
take
any
step
which
would
place
universal-rundle
corporation
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
because
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
itself
has
now
recognized
that
we
would
have
an
industry-wide
practice
that
in
order
to
avoid
unfair
treatment,
they
should
take
every
step
they
possibly
can
to
avoid
placing
one
company
under
an
order
before
the
remaining
companies
in
the
industry
are
similarly
under
and
order.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
mr.
justice
warren
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir,
but
mr.
--
mr.
justice
warren,
what
--
what
we
were
wanted
the
commission
to
do
was
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
our
competing
--
the
competitors
truckload
discount
because
how
could
the
commission
insist
on
entering
an
order
against
universal-rundle
corporation
for
a
truckload
discount
which
average
but
10%
and
the
commission
refused
to
even
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
other
manufacturers
of
the
industry.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
you
are
assuming
mr.
justice
warren
that
our
differentials
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
you
are
assuming
mr.
justice
warren
that
that
our
differentials
are
the
only
ones
that
have
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
competition.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
if
you
would
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
we
have
established
that
each
of
the
six
other
manufacturers
granted
truckload
discounts
of
18%
in
a
precise
same
manner
as
we
did.
the
commission
went
on
to
rule
that
certain
of
our
customers
were
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantities
and
because
these
truckload
quantities
were
beyond
the
buying
capabilities
of
certain
of
our
customers,
the
customers
buying
in
less
than
truckload
quantities
were
paying
a
higher
price
at
a
10%
price
differential
was
sufficient
to
cause
an
adverse
effect
on
the
competition.
all
the
commission
had
to
do
was
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
other
manufacturers
and
find
out
whether
or
not
there
was
any
co
--
any
other
--
any
customers
of
those
manufacturers
who
would
likewise
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantities.
the
commission
then
could
have
applied
the
same
rational
at
--
that
it
did
applied
it
in
this
case
and
that
is
certainly
in
an
industry
where
price
was
so
significant
and
so
important
that
where
you
had
a
price
differential
of
18%
and
you
had
some
customers
in
a
trading
area
who
were
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantities
that
that
was
sufficient
for
the
problem
--
before
the
commission
to
conclude
that
injury
to
competition
maybe
adversely
affected.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
decision
rendered
on
june
12th
1964,
the
federal
trade
commission
found
that
universal-rundle
corporation,
a
manufacturer
of
cast-iron
and
victor's
china
fixtures
had
violated
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
by
granting
a
discount
averaging
10%
on
plumbing
fixtures
sold
under
respondent's
brand
name
in
truckload
quantities.
the
commission
ruled
that
such
discounts
may
adversely
affect
competition
on
the
buyer
level
since
the
truckload
quantities
were
deemed
by
the
commission
to
be
beyond
the
buying
capabilities
of
certain
of
respondent's
customers
who
competed
with
a
customer
buying
in
truckload
quantities.
on
july
20th,
1964,
universal-rundle
requested
the
commission
to
stay
the
effective
date
of
the
order
for
at
least
18
months
and
within
that
period
of
time
for
the
commission
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
truckload
discount
practices
of
respondent's
six
principal
competitors.
in
requesting
this
stay,
universal-rundle
brought
the
following
matters
to
the
attention
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
first;
the
commission
was
furnished
with
each
of
respondents
six
major
competitor's
price-list
and
price
bulletins
showing
that
plumbing
fixtures
purchased
in
truckload
quantities
were
priced
not
10%
but
approximately
18%
below
the
price
paid
for
identical
fixtures
by
those
competitor's
customers
in
less
than
truckload
quantity.
the
commission
was
advised
if
the
company
sale
with
universal-rundle
branded
fixtures
accounted
for
approximately
5%
or
precisely
5.75%
of
the
total
industry
sales.
with
this
market
share
being
one
of
the
smallest
in
the
industry,
while
four
of
respondent's
competitors'
sales
accounted
for
66%
of
the
total
industry
sales.
the
leading
manufacturer's
share
and
a
manufacturer
who
were
shown
to
be
granting
a
truckload
discount
of
18%,
his
--
that
company's
share
of
the
market
was
32%
and
the
second
breaking
manufacturer's
share
of
the
market
was
15%.
the
commission
was
informed
by
universal-rundle
that
it
had
incurred
substantial
losses
during
each
of
three
years
immediately
preceding
the
entry
of
the
commission's
order
to
cease-and-desist.
these
losses
amounted
to
over
one-half
million
dollars,
during
each
of
the
three
years.
the
ftc's
attention
was
invited
to
publish
by
native
data
showing
the
substantial
profits
of
its
six
principal
competitors.
in
an
affidavit
by
its
vice-president
in
charged
of
marketing,
the
company
predicted
that
an
immediate
entry
of
the
cease-and-desist
order
against
universal-rundle
for
engaging
in
an
industry-wide
practice
without
the
ftc
taking
some
action
to
correct
this
industry-wide
practice
of
granting
truckload
discounts
would
have
the
direct
result
of
substantially
decreasing
its
sales
volume
which
would
then
be
taken
over
by
its
large
competitors
who
were
free
to
continue
to
engage
in
the
same
practice
of
granting
truckload
discounts.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
we
alleged
mr.
justice
warren
that
the
--
that
the
discounts
that
the
competitors
granted
were
done
in
the
same
manner
as
universal-rundle
granted
its
discounts.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
that
is
our
contention,
yes
sir.
on
august
4th,
the
federal
trade
commission
refused
to
stay
the
effective
date
of
the
cease-and-desist
order
holding
that
our
showing
was
insufficient
to
warrant
any
such
action.
furthermore,
the
commission
in
denying
the
stay
took
the
position
that
our
showing
concerning
its
competitor's
truckload
discounts
was
not
sufficient
for
the
commission
to
undertake
any
investigation
of
any
of
the
competitors.
in
short,
the
ftc
refused
to
take
any
action
in
the
plumbing
fixture
industry
except
to
insist
that
an
immediate
order
be
entered
against
universal-rundle
corporation
for
granting
a
10%
truckload
discount
while
its
competitors
were
not
even
to
be
subjected
to
an
ftc
investigation
for
offering
truckload
discounts
averaging
18%.
following
a
series
of
correspondence
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
--
we
claim
sir
and
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
harlan
agreed
with
this
that
the
commission
abused
its
discretion

mr.

when
it
refused

mr.
frank

no

say
that

i
will
not
charge
them
with
bad
faith,

a
series
of
correspondence
between
complaint
counsel
for
the
commission
and
universal-rundle's
counsel

as

furnished
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
commission
in
april
of
1965,
advised
respondents
counsel
that
it
would
not
then
undertake
an
investigation
of
universal-rundle's
two
largest
competitor
because
such
an
investigation
might
conflict
with
the
pending
investigation
by
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
by
the
time
this
case
reached
the
court
of
appeals,
the
ftc
acknowledged
in
its
brief,
filed
in
that
court,
that
the
customer
information
which
we
had
furnished
to
the
commission
tended
to
show
current
violations
of
section
2
(a)
by
the
two
largest
competitors,
namely
american
radiator
and
kohler
company.
the
court
of
appeals
in
setting
aside
the
commission's
order
held
that
universal-rundle
had
made
a
strong
showing
that
its
competitors
were
engaged
in
the
same
practice
as
found
to
be
illegal
when
done
by
respondent.
the
court
held
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
ftc's
refusal
to
even
make
an
investigation
and
that
is
the
significant
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission's
refusal
to
even
undertake
an
investigation
of
our
relatively
few
competitors
who
were
granting
higher
discounts
was
a
patent
abuse
of
the
commission's
administrative
discretion.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
that's
correct
mr.
warren,
they
did
not.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
the
court
of
appeals
merely
held
mr.
warren
that
we
had
made
a
sufficient
showing
to
the
point
that
the
commission
should
have
undertaken
an
investigation
of
our
competitors
to
see
whether
or
not
the
commission
should
issue
a
complaint
or
take
some
action
with
respect
to
its
competitors.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
yes,
mr.
warren,
they
did
it.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
they
--
they
did
not
go
to
the
merits
mr.
justice
warren.
they
--
they
merely
held
that
we
had
furnished
sufficient
showings
so
that
the
commission
should
have
undertaken
some
type
of
investigation.
if
you
assert,
it's
--
it's
similarly
to
when
the
federal
trade
commission
decides
in
any
industry-wide
investigation.
when
the
commission
undertakes
an
industry-wide
investigation,
the
commission
does
not
first
pick
out
a
guinea
pig
and
issue
a
complaint
and
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
against
that
company
before
proceeding
on
an
industry-wide
basis.
what
the
court
held
was
in
essence
if
you
would
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
held
that
we
had
shown
the
commission
or
given
the
commission
sufficient
information
so
that
the
commission
should
have
been
followed
its
announced
enforcement
policies
and
undertaken
an
industry-wide
investigation
of
the
plumbing
fixture
industry.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
mr.
justice
fortas,
certainly
the
court
left
the
commission
free
to
decide
how
they
wanted
to
undertake
an
investigation
and
what
the
commission
wanted
to
do
after
they
did
conduct
that
investigation
in
the
plumbing
fixture
industry.
the
commission
was
free
to
do
anything
it
sought
that
after
a
conducted
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir.
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
been
unable
mr.
justice
fortas
to
find
a
precedent
or
a
case
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
it
was
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
commission's
refusal
to
either
stay
the
order
or
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
industry-wide
practice
of
grating
truckload
discounts
was
inconsistent
with
the
overriding
policy
of
the
amended
clayton
act.
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
pendency
of
the
department
of
justice
proceeding
did
not
serve
to
excuse
the
commission's
refusal
to
investigate.
the
basic
question
as
i
see
it
presented
to
this
court
for
decision
is
whether
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
agency
charged
by
the
congress
with
the
primary
responsibility
for
enforcement
of
the
robinson-patman
act
acted
arbitrarily
in
an
abuse
of
its
discretion
when
it
chose
to
ignore
the
pricing
practices
of
universal-rundle's
competitors
yet
insisted
that
an
immediate
order
be
entered
against
that
company
and
that
company
alone
for
engaging
in
the
same
pricing
practice.
we
have
set
forth
three
reasons
in
our
brief
why
we
think
the
commission
committed
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
industry.
briefly
summarized
they
are
as
follows.
the
court
below
was
unable
to
detect
how
enforcement
of
this
order
against
universal-rundle
corporation
coupled
with
an
ftc
flat
refusal
to
investigate
any
other
plumbing
fixture
manufacturer
would
be
in
conformity
with
the
statutory
objectives
of
congress
in
enacting
to
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
congress
was
placing
its
trust
in
the
ftc
that
it
would
not
enforce
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
lessen
or
impair
competition
at
any
distributional
level.
it
is
our
position
that
the
ftc
in
taking
the
action
it
did
in
this
case,
failed
to
consider
how
it's
refusal
to
investigate
any
the
other
manufacturer's
truckload
discounts
could
only
contribute
to
a
further
increase
in
the
high
degree
of
concentration
shown
to
exist
in
this
industry.
yet,
entry
of
an
order
against
universal-rundle
would
not
benefit
any
of
universal-rundle's
customers.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
interpret
the
commission's
statement
of
august
4th,
1964
mr.
justice
harlan
as
they
may
refuse,
they
would
refuse
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
construed
the
commission
is
saying
that
in
its
statement
of
august
4th,
1964,
yes
mr.
harlan.
and
i
think
if
there
was
any
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
commission
would
undertake
an
investigation,
i
point
the
court's
attention
to
the
series
of
correspondence
that
i
had
with
the
complaint
counsel
following
the
commisi
--
commission's
denial
of
our
stay.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
it
appears
at
--
as
appendix
c
to
the
government's
brief.
to
comply
with
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
page
62
and
63
of
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
--
transcript
of
the
record,
yes
sir.
to
comply
with
the
order,
universal-rundle
has
only
two
practical
choices.
the
company
could
eliminate
truckload
discounts
or
it
could
terminate
those
customers
the
ftc
deems
incapable
of
buying
in
such
quantities.
if
it
made
the
first
choice
that
is
if
it
eliminated
truckload
discounts,
the
company's
smaller
customers
would
still
be
competing
in
the
marketplace
with
other
manufacturer's
customers
who
continue
to
receive
the
price
concessions
on
truckload
quantities.
since
it
is
obvious
i
submit
that
a
company
who's
share
of
the
market
is
a
small
as
universal-rundle's
is
in
no
position
to
be
a
setter
of
marketing
business,
be
a
setter
of
policy
with
effective
prices
in
this
industry.
and
for
this
reason,
elimination
of
truckload
discounts
would
not
affect
the
pricing
practices
of
the
large
manufacturers
such
as
american
standard,
kohler
and
the
other
companies
mentioned
in
our
petition
for
a
stay.
universal-rundle's
smaller
customers,
under
these
circumstances
would
be
in
no
better
competitive
position
as
a
result
of
the
ftc's
order.
if
universal-rundle
chose
the
second
method
and
terminated
customers
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantity,
these
customers
undoubtedly
would
continue
to
purchase
plumbing
fixtures
at
the
higher
discriminatory
price
from
one
or
more
of
respondent's
competitors.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
quite
apparent
we
submit
that
immediate
entry
of
the
order
against
universal-rundle
would
not
make
the
adverse
effect
on
the
buyer
level
of
competition
since
the
terminating
customers
would
still
be
buying
in
less
than
truckload
quantity
from
a
competitor
of
ur
--
universal-rundle
and
at
a
higher
discriminatory
price.
on
the
other
hand,
regardless
of
which
of
the
two
methods
are
taken
by
universal-rundle
to
comply
with
the
ftc's
cease-and-desist
order,
it's
market
share
could
only
be
decreased
and
it's
last
buyers
would
shift
from
un
--
was
last
buyers
would
shift
from
universal-rundle
to
the
competitors
who
have
larger
market
shares
and
who
are
free
to
continue
to
engage
in
the
industry's
wide
practice.
the
second
reason
we
contend
as
to
why
the
ftc
abused
its
discretion
in
this
proceeding
is
that
it
failed
to
heed
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
moog
industries
inc.
versus
the
ftc
reported
at
355
u.s.
411.
on
page
413
of
the
moog
decision,
this
court
stated
as
follows.
“although
an
allegedly
illegal
practice
may
appear
to
be
operative
throughout
an
industry,
whether
such
appearances
reflect
facts
and
whether
all
firms
in
an
industry
should
be
dealt
with
in
a
single
proceeding
or
should
receive
individualized
treatment,
our
questions
that
call
for
discretionary
determinations
by
the
administrative
agency,”
end
of
the
statement
from
the
moog
decision.
we
submit
that
in
moog,
this
court
concluded
that
before
the
ftc
exercised
its
discretion
in
determining
whether
it's
a
cease
and
des
--
enter
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
against
one
company,
the
commission
should
have
made
some
effort
to
find
out
whether
the
alleged
--
allegedly
illegal
practice
is
in
fact
industry-wide
in
scope.
here,
when
the
ftc
was
confronted
with
document
showing
that
respondent's
competitors
were
granting
truckload
discounts
of
approximately
18%,
here
where
in
this
very
record
that
we've
shown,
five
of
the
seven
non-truckload
customers
of
respondent
also
purchased
from
one
or
more
of
the
other
manufacturers,
here,
where
the
ftc
found
that
a
discount
averaging
10%
may
lessen
the
competition
in
an
industry
in
which
price
competition
was
intense.
the
ftc
flatly
refused
to
take
any
action
to
obtain
the
very
type
of
information
which
this
court
in
moog
has
held
it
should
have
had
to
make
an
informed
decision
as
to
the
most
efficacious
method
of
enforcing
the
law.
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
in
moog
was
whether
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
should
go
into
effect
against
one
company
before
the
time
other
competitors
who
were
already
being
prosecuted
or
investigated
were
brought
under
similar
orders.
this
court
in
effect
held
that
the
commission
was
the
master
of
its
own
timetable
insofar
as
entry
of
an
order
to
cease-and-desist
was
concerned.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
this
court
in
moog
did
not
condone
or
sanctioned
a
flat
refusal
by
the
ftc
to
ignore
industry-wide
violations
as
it
has
done
in
the
plumbing
fixture
industries.
universal-rundle
has
not
asked
that
its
order
be
stayed
until
similar
orders
are
entered
against
one
or
more
of
its
competitors.
all
the
company
ask
is
the
ftc
to
investigate
its
competitors
and
after
such
an
investigation
for
it
then
can
determine
whether
the
best
enforcement
policy
is
to
invoke
its
adjudicatory
processes
to
obtain
compliance
in
this
industry.
and
if
so,
whether
an
order
should
be
entered
against
universal-rundle
immediately
or
whether
other
methods
such
as
the
issuance
of
guides,
trade
regulation
rules,
assurances
of
voluntary
compliance
from
each
one
of
the
manufacturers,
would
be
the
most
expeditious
and
effective
meth
--
effective
method
of
obtaining
industry-wide
compliance.
the
third
reason
why
the
ftc's
action
in
this
proceeding
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
that
in
issuing
an
order
against
respondent
and
refusing
to
even
investigate
its
competitors
that
commission
departed
from
its
own
announced
enforcement
policy.
the
federal
trade
commission
has
officially
reported
to
the
congress
in
its
annual
report
for
1964
and
i
quote
from
page
1
of
that
report,
“whenever
a
law
violation
was
identified,
the
commission
instead
of
applying
the
simple
and
superficially
vigorous
method
of
hoping
individual
violators
undertook
to
find
out
if
their
competitors
were
doing
likewise.
if
they
were,
the
commission
then
decided
how
best
this
competitively
generated
evil
could
be
eliminated
with
the
least
delay”
of
what
the
commission
has
told
the
congress
is
its
enforcement
policy.
the
commission
has
elaborated
on
this
policy
in
testimony
before
the
house
appropriations
subcommittee
which
is
reported
at
408
and
409
of
hearings
before
subcommittee
app
--
appropriations
of
the
independent
offices
89th
congress
first
session
and
i
quote
from
the
chairman's
testimony
of
the
commission
to
the
subcommittee
on
appropriations
of
the
congress.
“we
have
given
a
mandate
to
our
enforcement
bureaus,
instead
of
taking
these
cases
at
as
they
come,
one
by
one,
the
first
thing
they
are
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
this
is
an
isolated
situation
that
has
come
to
our
attention
or
whether
it
is
something
that
is
engaged
in
competitively
by
all
competitors.
if
so,
to
step
back
and
then
with
our
resources,
engage
in
what
i
would
hope
to
be
some
basic
planning
and
determine
what
would
be
the
best
tool
and
approach
for
us
to
take.”
i'm
still
quoting
from
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
“historically,
the
commission
was
wedded
to
the
procedure
of
taking
our
customers
or
their
cases
as
they
came.
the
commission
had
hoped
that
with
the
tools
that
congress
had
afforded
the
commission
to
work
with
that
even
on
a
case
by
case
method
that
proceeding
against
one,
the
others
if
it
affected
them,
would
take
notice
and
follow
suit,
it
just
didn't
worked
that
way.”
it
could
be
said,”
said
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
“in
all
fairness
to
these
people
that
if
there
were
50
engaged
in
the
same
practice,
what
certainty
would
a
party
have
that
if
they
stopped,
the
other
49
would
stop.
in
our
country,
very
rarely
can
a
man
be
his
'brother's
keeper.
i
think
this
is
the
basis
of
the
law.
we
are
trying
to
enforce
our
law
in
the
american
way
equitably
and
fairly.”
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation
of
the
testimony
by
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
before
the
house
appropriation
committee.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
commission's
action
in
this
proceeding
is
diametrically
opposed
to
and
in
conflict
with
the
above
quoted
enforcement
policy
of
this
agency.
here,
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
has
told
a
congressional
committee
that
at
every
instance
when
it
identified
the
law
of
violation,
its
staff
is
under
specific
instructions
to
find
out
if
competitors
are
engaged
in
the
same
practice.
now,
once
it
is
determined
that
the
practice
is
industry-wide,
then
and
only
then
according
to
the
commission
statements
to
the
congress
does
the
commission
decides
the
best
important
method
to
eliminate
the
illegality.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
this
was
a
justification
of
commission's
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
1965.
in
short,
this
announced
enforcement
policy
which
the
commission
refuses
to
follow
in
this
proceeding
suggests
that
the
ftc
has
interpreted
the
moog
decision
in
precisely
the
same
manner
in
which
respondent
has
urged
in
its
arguments
before
this
court.
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
has
candidly
stated
on
several
occasions
why
this
enforcement
policy
has
been
undertaken
by
the
commission.
he
stated
in
a
speech
on
june
16th,
1965,
that
may
add
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
copies
of
all
of
the
speeches
that
we
have
referred
to
in
our
briefs
had
been
filed
with
the
clerk,
that
the
policy
according
to
the
chairman,
that
the
policy
reported
by
the
commission
to
the
congress
quotes,
“gives
all
violators
an
opportunity
to
rid
themselves
of
the
illegalities
simultaneously
without
suffering
competitive
injury
in
the
process.”
the
chairman
has
summed
up
in
a
few
precise
words
the
rational
of
the
lower
court's
relief
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
dickson
who
astutely
observed
“the
man
who
is
willing
to
comply
with
the
law
simply
can't
afford
to
if
the
competitor
is
allowed
to
go
on
violating
it.”
no
explanation
was
given
by
the
federal
trade
commission
for
deviating
from
its
announced
enforcement
policy
in
the
proceeding
against
the
universal-rundle
at
the
time
the
agency
refused
to
grant
the
stay
of
its
order.
in
this
court,
the
ftc
claims
that
an
industry-wide
approach
was
not
appropriate
because
the
truckload
discount
practices
of
respondents
were
and
i
quote
from
page
12
of
the
reply
brief
“ancillary
to
the
main
case
involving
discriminations
in
favor
of
sears,
roebuck
and
company.
the
ftc
however
ruled
that
that
company's
prices
to
sears,
roebuck
were
not
in
violation
of
the
act.”
i
submit
that
the
ftc's
characterization
of
the
truckload
discount
practices
as
inquiry
to
its
main
case
is
in
effect
an
admission
that
no
complaint
would
have
been
issued
if
the
company's
prices
to
sears
had
not
been
challenged.
if
this
is
correct,
there
would
appear
to
be
no
reason
for
the
commission
to
have
entered
an
order
against
the
company
unless
it
was
at
that
time
ready
to
undertake
an
industry-wide
investigation
of
the
truckload
discount
practices
of
other
manufacturers
in
the
industry
which
of
course
it
refused
to
do.
in
denying
the
stay
in
august
of
1964
and
refusing
to
take
any
action
with
respect
to
the
other
manufacturer's
discount,
the
commission,
i
submit,
has
done
exactly
and
precisely
what
the
federal
trade
commission
and
its
chairman
have
labeled
as
both
“on
bear
to
the
sole
company
who
is
prosecuted
and
is,”
and
i
quote
again,
“a
superficial
method
of
enforcing
the
law.”
this
court,
we
respectfully
submit,
should
not
reverse
the
lower
court's
decision
in
the
instant
case
since
the
decision
is
in
conformity
with
the
announced
enforcement
policies
of
the
commission.
i
submit
a
reversal
would
be
tantamount
to
this
court
encouraging
the
ftc
to
proceed,
to
enforce
the
law
in
a
manner
which
that
very
agency
has
and
no
in
certain
terms
described
as
unfair
and
in
conflict
with
the
original
purpose
of
the
commission
of
guiding
the
business
without
bringing
down
upon
it
the
menace
of
the
law.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
page
62?
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
they
go
on
on
page
63,
and
they
set
forth
the
type
of
information
which
they
say
is
necessary
before
they
would
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
manufacturer's
truckload
discounts.
they
state
there
that
while
the
practice
of
granting
a
discount
may
under
certain
circumstances
such
as
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
at
page
63.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
the
second
--
the
second
line
is
while
the
practice
of
granting
such
discount
may
under
certain
circumstances
such
as
--
such
as
those
shown
in
this
record
of
this
proceeding
result
in
price
discriminations
having
prescribed
competitive
effect,
the
practice
is
not
necessarily
illegal
as
indicated
in
respondent's
petition.
then
they
go
on
to
add
all
of
the
various
elements
that
they
think
would
be
necessary
in
order
for
the
commission
to
undertake
an
investigation.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
is
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion
for
it
to
refuse
to
undertake
the
investigation
of
the
respondent's
competitor.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
sir,
we
gave
--
sir
we
gave
them
all
of
the
information
that
we
had
in
our
possession
with
respect
to
the
competitor's
truckload
discounts.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
think,
mr.
white,
mr.
justice
white
that
certainly
based
on
the
information
that
we
showed
to
the
commission,
the
commission
should
have
undertaken
an
investigation.
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
white
that
just
merely
to
come
in
and
say
it
is
an
industry-wide
practice
that
therefore,
the
commission
should
go
ahead
and
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
whole
industry,
but
we
did
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
aback
that
these
six
manufacturers,
competing
manufacturers
of
the
universal-rundle
were
in
fact
granting
a
higher
truckload
discount
if
you
would
please,
and
was
involved
in
a
proceeding
against
universal-rundle
corporation.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
if
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
had
said
that
and
in
doing
that,
the
commission
had
decided
that
we
would
not
have
been
competitively
injured,
i
could
not
quarrel
with
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
i
would
think
mr.
justice
white
that
if
the
commission
is
going
to
follow
his
announced
enforcement
policy
that
it
would
not
knowingly
take
any
step
which
would
place
universal-rundle
corporation
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
because
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
itself
has
now
recognized
that
we
would
have
an
industry-wide
practice
that
in
order
to
avoid
unfair
treatment,
they
should
take
every
step
they
possibly
can
to
avoid
placing
one
company
under
an
order
before
the
remaining
companies
in
the
industry
are
similarly
under
and
order.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
mr.
justice
warren
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
no
sir,
but
mr.
--
mr.
justice
warren,
what
--
what
we
were
wanted
the
commission
to
do
was
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
our
competing
--
the
competitors
truckload
discount
because
how
could
the
commission
insist
on
entering
an
order
against
universal-rundle
corporation
for
a
truckload
discount
which
average
but
10%
and
the
commission
refused
to
even
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
other
manufacturers
of
the
industry.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
you
are
assuming
mr.
justice
warren
that
our
differentials
--
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
you
are
assuming
mr.
justice
warren
that
that
our
differentials
are
the
only
ones
that
have
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
competition.
mr.
frank
c.
mcaleer
if
you
would
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
we
have
established
that
each
of
the
six
other
manufacturers
granted
truckload
discounts
of
18%
in
a
precise
same
manner
as
we
did.
the
commission
went
on
to
rule
that
certain
of
our
customers
were
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantities
and
because
these
truckload
quantities
were
beyond
the
buying
capabilities
of
certain
of
our
customers,
the
customers
buying
in
less
than
truckload
quantities
were
paying
a
higher
price
at
a
10%
price
differential
was
sufficient
to
cause
an
adverse
effect
on
the
competition.
all
the
commission
had
to
do
was
to
undertake
an
investigation
of
the
other
manufacturers
and
find
out
whether
or
not
there
was
any
co
--
any
other
--
any
customers
of
those
manufacturers
who
would
likewise
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantities.
the
commission
then
could
have
applied
the
same
rational
at
--
that
it
did
applied
it
in
this
case
and
that
is
certainly
in
an
industry
where
price
was
so
significant
and
so
important
that
where
you
had
a
price
differential
of
18%
and
you
had
some
customers
in
a
trading
area
who
were
unable
to
buy
in
truckload
quantities
that
that
was
sufficient
for
the
problem
--
before
the
commission
to
conclude
that
injury
to
competition
maybe
adversely
affected.
