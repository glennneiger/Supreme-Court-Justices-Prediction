justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
a
primary
line
case,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
--
i
take
it
you
say
that
--
that
the
--
it's
just
irrelevant
in
the
ftc
proceedings
what
the
commission
is
doing
--
these
are
the
competitors
and
it
may
properly
refuse
to
even
listen
to
the
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
this
sentence
is
--
what
if
--
what
if
this
sentence
brief
can
--
we
just
aren't
interested
in
finding
out
what
your
competitors
are
doing.
you
claim
that
your
competitors
are
worse
than
you
are,
but
even
if
we
found
that
they
were,
we
would
still
order
you
alone,
it's
just
irrelevant.
we
have
to
be
able
to
order
our
own
proceedings
and
we're
proceeding
against
you
now.
don't
--
don't
mention
your
competitors
to
us.
now
couldn't
--
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
that
--
there
isn't
anything
than
this
--
very
little
that
anything
it
could
do
with
respect
to
this
question
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
mentioned
in
moog?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
all
abusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all
is
abusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
could
it
prevent
these
past
views
for
a
preliminary
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
that
affect
the
commission
enforced
the
matter
of
investigation
[inaudible]
and
then
make
that
their
allegation
that
all
of
the
competitors
would
already
think
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
commission
says
[inaudible]
investigate
as
well
as
you
surrender
you
older
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
think
they
could
have
met
it
very
well
and
--
to
be
competitively
injured
if
you
have
to
stop
this
and
the
others
who
are
really
doing
it,
we're
going
to
investigate
cease-and-desist
that
this
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
a
primary
line
case,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
--
i
take
