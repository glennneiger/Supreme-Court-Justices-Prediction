mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
out
--
out
of
the
court,
how
the
court
of
appeals,
they
found
these
precise
factors
which
followed
in
throughout
the
industry
without
reaching
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcaleer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
--
if
the
procedures
of
all
six
of
those
competitors
that
you
speak
of
in
regard
to
less
than
truckload
quantities
were
identically
to
those
or
that
of
rundle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
your
answer
–
your
answer
is
that
they
weren't
identical?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
with
counsel
of
the
government
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
could
they
--
how
could
they
have
decided
then
that
the
--
that
the
practices
in
all
of
the
industry
were
identical
with
that
of
company
rundle
and
that
it
was
on
the
gross
abuse
of
discretion
for
them
to
treat
one
differently
from
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
didn't
it
base
that
–
didn't
they
base
that
opinion
on
the
fact
that
the
conditions
throughout
the
industry
were
identical
and
that
--
that
the
commission
had
selected
this
one
company
to
move
against
and
therefore
it
was
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
they
not
--
did
they
not
go
to
the
merits
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
would
we
find
the
language
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
the
commission
refused
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcaleer,
i
--
i've
read
pages
62
and
63
of
the
transcript.
would
you
read
me
the
language
please
that
you
rely
on
saying
that
they
refused
to
consider
the
--
consider
at
any
time
the
--
the
like
conduct
on
the
part
of
others
in
the
industry?

chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
is
that
–
oh
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it's
at
the
top
--
at
the
top
of
the
page
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i've
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
mcaleer,
i
am
--
i
--
i
have
read
this
document,
page
62
and
63,
and
i
understood
it
to
say
in
the
beginning
that
--
that
all
differential
between
truckloads
and
less
than
truckload
amounts
are
not
illegal
and
that
their
cease-and-desist
order
against
you
does
not
prevent
you
from
having
some
differentials
between
them
provided
you
have
not
been
--
they're
not
in
anti
--
anticompetitive,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
after
that
consequently,
the
general
allegation
by
respondent
that
its
competitors
are
granting
truckload
discounts
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
in
this
--
instituting
industry-wide
proceedings
to
condemn
this
practice
nor
is
it
a
valid
reason
for
--
for
withholding
enforcement
of
the
order
against
the
respondent
in
this
matter?
the
premise
that
--
they
premise
such
statement
on
the
fact
that,
that
all
differentials
are
not
not
bad
and
that
those
differentials
are
open
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
am
i
--
am
i
incorrect
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
were
the
only
one
who
in
the
industry
who
--
who
used
these
differentials
for
anticompetitive
purposes.
but
still
the
others
had
had
differentiated
--
differentials
that
were
not
anticompetitive,
would
that
prohibit
the
ftc
from
proceeding
against
you
until
they
investigate
the
whole
industry
to
decide
if
anybody
else
was
--
was
committing
the
same
violations
that
you
are?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
they
say
that
it's
only
your
general
allegation
that
is
insufficient.
in
other
words,
that
you
haven't
--
you
haven't
established
that
the
thing
--
that
the
practices
of
the
other
--
other
companies
are
the
same
that
therefore,
they
are
--
you
assume
equitable
for
them
to
proceed
against
you,
that's
the
way
i
read
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
rifkind,
will
you
address
yourself
to
that
particular
point
please?
chief

you

chief

well,
alright.
