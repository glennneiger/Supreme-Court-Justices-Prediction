mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
upon
the
petition
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
it
presents
for
decision
the
question
of
whether
the
enforcement
policy
of
the
federal
trade
commission
is
to
be
determined
by
the
commission
or
by
the
several
courts
of
appeals.
more
particularly,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
below
exceeded
the
proper
bounds
of
its
authority,
in
staying
the
commission's
order
that
universal-rundle
cease-and-desist
from
violations
of
the
robinson-patman
act
until
the
commission
makes
an
industry-wide
investigation
of
the
pricing
practices
of
universal-rundle's
competitors.
it
is
recognized
on
all
sides
i
believe,
that
the
issue
here
is
governed
by
this
courts
decision
in
moog
industries
which
held
that
the
commission's
determination
whether
or
not
to
withhold
the
cease-and-desist
order
until
competitors
are
proceeded
against,
is
not
to
be
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
absence
of
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion.
universal-rundle
is
a
manufacturer
of
plumbing
fixtures.
in
1957,
it
enjoyed
net
sales
of
approximately
$24
million.
it
sells
it
wares
to
some
8000
dealers
under
its
ur
brand
name.
in
addition,
it
sells
plumbing
fixtures
to
sears,
roebuck
and
company,
which
are
retailed
under
sears'
private
brand
homart.
sears
is
of
course
a
very
large
retailer.
its
annual
sales
volume
exceeds
$3
billion
and
sears,
roebuck
owned
some
60%
of
universal-rundle's
capital
stock
and
i
should
say
it
was
this
intimate
relationship
between
sears
and
rundle
that
led
initially
to
the
focusing
of
attention
on
rundle.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
does
not
because
it
was
eventually
determined
after
very
lengthy
hearings,
most
of
which
had
been
deleted
from
this
record
that
the
homart
and
the
ur
lines
were
not
of
like
grade
and
quality.
on
august
4,
1960,
the
trade
commission
issued
two
complaints
charging
sears
and
rundle
respectively
with
violations
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
complaint
against
rundle
alleged
that
rundle
was
violating
section
2
(a),
in
two
ways;
first,
by
selling
fixtures
to
sears
under
the
homart
brand
at
lower
prices
than
it
sold
its
ur
line
of
fixtures
to
competitors
of
sears
and
second,
by
selling
its
own
ur
line
at
different
prices
to
purchasers
competing
in
the
resale
of
the
ur
line.
a
motion
by
commission's
counsel
to
consolidate
the
two
cases
was
denied
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
hearings
were
then
commences
the
rundle
case
in
october
1962.
following
the
close
of
those
hearings,
the
examiner
found
as
i've
just
indicated
to
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
homart
and
ur
lines
were
not
of
like
grade
and
quality,
and
he
therefore
dismissed
so
much
of
the
complaint
as
charged
--
as
charged
rundle
with
discriminating
in
favor
of
sears.
with
respect
to
the
remainder
of
the
complaint,
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
rundle
sold
ur
brand
plumbing
fixtures
to
some
purchasers
in
the
philadelphia-camden
area
at
prices
substantially
below
those
charged
by
respondent
for
products
of
like
grade
and
quality
to
other
competing
purchasers
in
the
same
market
area.
he
also
found
that
in
the
competitive
circumstances
prevailing,
the
disfavored
dealers
were
likely
to
suffer
competitive
injury
if
rundle's
discriminatory
practices
were
to
continue
and
he
therefore
ordered
rundle
to
cease-and-desist
from
discriminating
in
price
between
customers
who
compete
in
fact
with
each
other
in
the
resale
of
rundle's
fixtures
other
than
the
homart
line.
on
cross-appeals
to
the
commission,
the
hearing
examiner's
initial
decision
was
affirmed
in
all
respects
that
are
relevant
here.
the
commission
rejected
rundle's
contention
that
the
requisite
injury
to
competition
had
not
been
shown.
in
particular,
the
commission
held
that
the
fact
that
price
differential
was
--
were
attributable
to
truckload
discounts
which
were
offered
to
all
customers
did
not
negate
competitive
injury
because
it
has
been
shown
that
truckload
discounts
were
beyond
--
the
truckload
quantities
were
beyond
the
buying
capabilities
of
some
of
the
customers.
the
commission's
final
order
was
issued
on
june
12,
1964
and
on
july
20,
1964
rundle
petitioned
the
commission
to
withdraw
that
order.
the
petition
also
prayed
that
reentry
of
the
order
be
stayed
for
18
months
that
it
be
reentered
only
on
30
days
notice
to
rundle,
and
that
an
immediate
temporary
stay
issue
pending
a
decision
on
the
petition.
the
petition
alleged
that
the
stay
was
sought
to
afford
the
commission
sufficient
time
to
investigate
and
institute
whatever
proceedings
are
deemed
appropriate
by
the
commission
to
correct
the
industry-wide
practice
of
granting
discounts
on
truckload
shippings.
the
petition
further
alleged
that
if
the
cease-and-desist
order
was
not
stayed
pending
corrective
action
of
industry-wide
practices,
rundle
would
suffer
competitive
disadvantage
and
extreme
hardship.
in
support
of
these
contentions,
rundle
attached
exhibits
indicating
that
its
six
principal
competitors,
all
offered
truckload
discounts.
it
also
urged
that
rundle's
market
share
exclusive
of
its
sales
to
sears
was
5.75%
ranking
sixth
in
the
industry
and
that
rundle
suffered
losses
in
the
proceeding
three
and
a
half
years
whereas
its
six
major
competitors
had
enjoyed
profits.
an
affidavit
of
rundle's
marketing
vice-president
stated
that
the
company
may
suffer
further
substantial
financial
losses
if
it
must
be
the
sole
plumbing
fixture
manufacturer
under
an
order
to
cease-and-desist.
the
commission
denied
the
petition.
in
doing
so,
it's
stated
that
the
fact
that
respondent
may
have
incurred
losses
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
order,
does
not
support
the
contention
that
enforcement
of
the
order
will
cause
a
financial
hardship.
it
also
stated
that
the
general
allegation
by
respondent
that
its
competitors
are
granting
truckload
discounts
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
--
instituting
industry-wide
proceedings
to
condemn
this
practice
nor
is
it
a
valid
reason
for
withholding
enforcement
of
the
cease-and-desist
order.
rundle
then
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
both
the
cease-and-desist
order
and
that
an
order
denying
the
stay.
the
court
of
appeals
reserved
decision
on
the
cease-and-desist
order.
accordingly,
the
merits
of
that
order
are
not
now
before
this
court.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
commission's
order
denying
rundle's
petition
for
a
stay.
the
court
found
that
the
commission
had
directed
its
attack
against
a
general
practice
which
is
prevalent
in
the
industry,
but
that
in
doing
so,
it
had
selected
one
who
share
in
the
market
is
less
than
60%
whose
discounts
were
lower
on
the
average
than
its
competitors'.
it
also
held
that
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right,
your
honor,
which
puts
us
in
a
--
puts
the
commission
in
a
particularly
awkward
position
as
i'm
sure
you
realize
because
we
may
have
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
so
we
pray.
it
held
that
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
this
case
your
honor.
as
i'm
trying
to
point
out
in
the
minute,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
rundle's
competitors
were
guilty,
more
guilty
than
rundle,
but
it
declined
to
determine
whether
rundle
was
guilty
and
i'm
sure
mr.
mcaleer
has
very
substantial
criticisms
of
the
order
on
the
merits
which
he
was
urging
also
before
the
court
and
which
hadn't
been
reached
or
which
have
to
be
decided
at
some
point.
under
the
--
i
should
just
add
at
this
point
that
under
the
decision,
the
commission
conceivably
could
launch
an
industry-wide
investigation
occupying
it
for
good
many
years,
and
come
back
to
find
that
its
original
order
against
rundle
is
in
some
respect
defective.
furthermore,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
order
of
the
commission
involved
the
sacrifice
of
a
comparatively
small
manufacture
when,
as
i
suggest,
when
as
i
have
suggested
it's
larger
and
more
guilty
competitors
“are
not
prosecuted.”
finally,
it
held
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
to
conduct
an
industry-wide
investigation
and
that
rundle's
showing
was
sufficient
to
require
the
commission
to
make
rundle's
competitors
parties
to
the
proceeding
against
rundle.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
started
from
mistaken
premises,
applied
an
unsound
legal
standard
and
produced
an
entirely
unworkable
result.
first
is
we've
just
alluded
too,
it
started
with
a
premise
that
rundle's
competitors
were
guilty.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
as
far
as
we
can
see,
as
far
as
the
commission
could
see
for
reaching
that
as
a
definitive
matter.
there
are
defenses.
there
are
individual
circumstances
that
have
to
be
shown
in
each
case,
a
violation
of
2
(a),
a
truckload
discount
is
not
a
per
se
violation
of
2
(a).
second,
the
court
accepted
at
face
value
rundle's
assertion
that
it
might
lose
business
if
the
commission's
order
is
not
stayed.
indeed,
the
court
--
the
court
apparently
concluded
sub
selentio
or
perhaps
ignored
the
question
that
the
harm
the
rundle
would
suffer
from
the
order
out
weighs
the
harm
its
competitors
would
suffer
--
i'm
sorry,
its
customers
would
suffer
from
staying
the
order.
after
all,
the
commission
had
determined
the
people
were
su
--
were
suffering
from
these
discriminatory
practices.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
evidence
that
rundle's
prediction
of
significant
injury
in
implausible.
thus,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
rundle
had
already
ceased
to
deal
with
the
smaller
customers
who
had
been
unable
to
purchase
in
truckload
quantities.
nor,
did
the
court
consider
that
under
the
commission's
order,
rundle
remained
free
to
grant
discounts
that
are
justified
by
lower
costs,
free
to
grant
discounts
to
meet
the
prices
--
prices
of
competitors
in
good
faith
and
free
to
grant
discounts
that
do
not
operate
to
discriminate
between
competing
customers.
and
i'd
particularly
like
to
stress
the
availability
even
under
the
order
of
the
good
faith
meeting
the
competition
defense
because
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
seem
to
have
focused
on
the
fact
that
rundle
pleaded
as
part
of
its
own
case,
good
faith
meeting
competition
and
then
for
reasons
which
it
alone
knows,
failed
to
prove
a
good
faith
meeting
a
competition.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
an
element
here
of
bringing
in
through
the
backdoor
what
one
couldn't
prove
or
didn't
prove
when
one
had
an
opportunity
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
is
true
that
i
--
that
even
if
we
assume
that
rundle's
competitors
were
all
violating
the
law,
much
more
egregiously
than
rundle,
the
commission
has
to
be
free
to
order
its
own
business
and
take
up
affairs,
make
investigations
when
as
in
if
it
gets
around
to
if
it
wants
to.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
that
has
happened.
i
do
think
that
it's
relevant,
that
rundle
is
not
without
remedy
if
the
facts
or
such,
although
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not.
rundle
is
perfectly
free
assuming
its
competitors
are
injuring
it
to
bring
treble
damage
actions,
to
bring
injunctive
actions
to
stop
that
sort
of
activity.
and
i
believe
that
the
commission
is
entitled
to
rely
in
some
measure
on
rundle's
determination
to
do
precisely
that.
that's
one
method
of
enforcing
the
law.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
this
is
a
2
(a)
case.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
if
rundle
is,
as
it
suggested,
will
be
injured
by
those
practices.
i
don't
see
why
there
isn't
a
treble
damage
action
and
an
injunctive
action.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
the
commission
under
this
court's
decision
in
moog
has
some
serious
responsibilities
which
are
its
responsibilities,
but
which
are
not
essentially
reviewable,
that
is
if
it
proceeds
on
a
--
as
long
as
it
proceeds
without
reference
to
consideration
that
have
no
rational
relation
to
a
legitimate
enforcement
policy,
i
know
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
should
think
that
the
commission
is
entitled
to
decide
that
it
will
proceed
against
a
few
firms
in
many
industries
or
many
firms
in
the
few
industries
or
lone
firm,
in
each
industry
that
that's
a
legitimate
policy
that
it
could
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
--
i
believe
that
the
sorts
of
allegations
that
rundle
has
made
are
on
their
face
not
the
sort
of
allegation
that
can
constitute
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
i
--
i
suppose
that
if
the
commission
were
to
say,
“we're
proceeding
against
firms
whose
stockholders
are
of
italian
ancestry
or
whose
directors
made
contributions
to
the
republican
party,”
that
would
be
i
think
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
there
are
probably
more
--
there
are
probably
other
examples
that
could
be
found,
but
i
do
think
that
the
words
in
moog
were
a
sort
of
saving
clause
dropped
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
against
the
possibilities
that
someday
a
very
outrageous
case
would
arise.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
i
want
to
advert
to
two
more
premises
that
the
court
proceeded
on
because
i
think
they
are
also
illustrative
of
the
difficulties
that
this
sort
of
review
gets
run
into,
because
after
all
this
comes
up
not
on
the
record
in
the
normal
sense.
this
isn't
a
review
to
see
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
supporting
that
commission
determination.
the
court
assumed
that
the
commission
has
wantonly
proceeded
against
one
of
the
smallest
of
a
group
of
violators.
indeed,
the
court
found
that
“the
industry
is
according
to
the
record
limited
to
a
few.
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
how
many
firms
there
are
in
this
industry.
the
record
does,
on
the
other
hand,
indicate
how
many
competitors
rundle
has
and
they
are
more
than
a
few.”
on
page
112
of
the
record,
rundle's
vice
president,
mr.
backner
named
17
firms
with
which
rundle
was
in
competition.
and
at
page
171,
mr.
backner
added
an
18th
and
indicated
that
there
were
perhaps
20,
25
or
more
such
firms.
yet,
the
court
below
apparently
focused
only
on
rundle's
six
largest
competitors.
it
failed
to
note
that
while
rundle
is
one
of
the
smaller
of
the
largest
firms,
it
is
nonetheless
larger
than
most
of
its
competitors.
but
the
court
adverted
to
the
fact
not
in
the
record
that
nearly
a
year
after
the
commission's
denial
of
the
stay,
the
commission's
counsel
informed
rundle's
counsel
that
an
investigation
could
not
then
be
undertaken
because
it
would
conflict
within
an
industry,
within
an
investigation
of
the
industry
being
conducted
by
the
antitrust
division.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
this
latter
investigation
as
somehow
not
qualifying
as
one
by
the
commission.
it
thus
leaves
the
commission
in
the
unhappy
--
with
the
unhappy
choice
between
letting
rundle
continue
with
unlawful
discriminations
or
launching
in
an
investigation
which
is
likely
to
immunize
defendants
and
thus
forwarded
two
pending
criminal
price-fixing
cases,
against
leading
members
of
the
plumbing
fixture
industry.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
pursuant
to
the
instructions
to
conduct
an
investigation,
the
commission
called
to
testify
any
officer
who
is
a
defendant
in
this
proceeding,
in
these
criminal
proceedings,
he
may
well
under
section
9
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
obtain
immunity.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
all
i
know
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
somewhat
to
the
antitrust
divisions
should
win
perhaps,
they
didn't
call
in
the
rundle
case
--
rundle's
vice
president
who
has
now
moved
to
dismiss
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
the
indictment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
but
--
presumably,
the
investigation
of
the
interest
only
is
to
culminates
in
a
proceeding.
they
are
not
just
going
to
investigate
this
industry
to
inform
themselves
about
it.
they're
going
to
investigate
it
so
that
they
could
put
rundle
and
its
competitors
under
like
orders,
at
least
that's
the
relief
that
i
understand
rundle
wishes.
even
if
the
commission
were
to
undertake,
the
investigation
required
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
faced
with
a
whole
series
of
quandaries.
if
it
is
required
to
investigate
the
whole
industry,
however,
many
firms
that
maybe
or
only
those
20
or
30
firms
that
compete
with
rundle,
or
only
those
six
or
seven
firms
that
rundle
has
referred
to
in
its
petition,
how
thorough
must
an
investigation
be
to
satisfy
the
court
of
appeals?
must
it
be
nationwide
in
the
scope
or
limited
to
a
few
markets?
and
what
is
the
commission
to
do
if
after
investigating
this
industry
or
some
part
of
it,
it
concludes
that
there
is
no
basis
for
issuing
the
complaints
against
rundle's
competitors.
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
has
found
that
the
other
firms
are
violating
the
law
and
has
directed
that
the
cease-and-desist
order
against
rundle
be
stayed
pending
corrective
action.
these
dilemmas,
we
submit
are
merely
indicative
of
the
fundamental
difficulty
with
the
decision
below.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
suggest,
misunderstood
this
court's
holding
in
moog
industries,
that
the
commission's
determination
to
stay
or
not
to
stay,
a
remedial
order,
may
not
be
overturned
to
the
absence
of
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion.
we
suggest
that
a
court
of
appeals
can
properly
hold
that
an
administrative
agency
has
people
who
abused
with
this
discretion
only
if
it
finds
that
the
agency
has
based
its
decision
on
consideration
having
no
rational
relationship
to
the
relevant
statutory
policy
to
be
enforced.
no
such
finding
has
been
or
could
be
made
here.
as
i
have
suggested
in
our
judgment
within
the
scope
of
discretion
left
by
moog,
affirmed
by
moog,
a
commission
--
the
commission
is
free
to
decide
to
proceed
intensively
or
extensively
against
many
firms
in
a
few
industries
or
a
few
firms
in
many
industries,
is
free
to
decide
that
it
could
be
most
effective
by
proceeding
against
the
largest
firm
in
an
industry
or
the
most
typical
firm
in
an
industry.
and
it
can
elect,
i
submit,
to
make
an
example
of
one
violator
in
an
industry
in
the
hope
of
the
others
will
be
brought
around,
if
not
by
altruism,
then
by
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
the
order
or
the
threat
of
reality
of
private
treble
damage
actions
and
injunction
actions.
and
again,
the
commission
may
certainly
act
in
the
light
of
information
that
is
received
in
confidence
as
to
the
enforcement
plans
of
other
agencies
of
the
government.
all
of
these
choices,
whatever
their
wisdom
or
unwisdom
fall
well
within
the
area
of
discretion
committed
by
congress
to
the
commission
and
may
not
be
overturned
by
the
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
--
if
i
have
exactly
which
point
it
was.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
did
want
to
address
myself
to
one
question
they
raise
and
that
is
the
i
--
the
question
of
the
identity
of
the
systems
that
these
six
or
seven
companies
were
using.
i
submit
that
you
cannot
tell
from
the
record,
the
material
submitted
to
the
commission
whether
those
systems
are
identical.
you
can't
tell
to
what
the
--
the
discount
is
applied
and
therefore
you
can't
tell
where
you
come
out
at
the
other
end.
and
with
--
with
which
products
are
identical
with
which,
so
it's
very
hard
to
appraise
the
relative
sides
of
these
discounts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
but
the
--
the
--
the
critical
question
here
is
whether
it
has
to
launch
an
investigation
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
has
reason
to
believe.
and
it
obviously
receives
complaints
a
great
--
a
great
--
against
the
great
many
people
continuously
and
it's
continuously
in
the
position
of
having
to
appraise
which
of
these
deserves
its
attention.
i
don't
know
of
how
you
could
tell
just
from
the
face
of
the
allegations
made
by
rundle
which
–
that
it
is
the
most
meritorious
of
claims
presented
to
the
commission.
secondly,
it's
--
it
is
also
i
think
quite
clear
in
response
to
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
put,
i
think
also
the
chief
justice
that
the
commission
has
not
precluded
itself
forever
from
investigating
this
industry.
indeed,
in
the
very
correspondence
to
which
mr.
mcaleer
referred,
at
page
54
of
our
principal
brief,
the
commission's
counsel
wrote
to
mcaleer,
“in
the
meantime,
it
would
be
of
considerable
assistance
to
us
and
would
contribute
substantially
to
any
investigation
which
we
do
undertake
if
you
would
advise
me
if
the
reasons
they
then
have
used
which
your
client
has
for
believing
that
some
of
the
accounts
listed
in
the
exhibits
to
your
letter
buy
fixtures
from
such
and
such
firm.
finally,
all
of
the
things
that
the
court
indicated
in
moog
which
might
prompt
the
commission
to
investigate
this
matter
or
not
come
down
essentially
to
the
critical
factor
that
the
commission
alone
is
empowered
to
develop
its
enforcement
policy
and
to
allocate
its
resources.
this
--
the
court
below
ignored
that
teaching.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
upon
the
petition
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
it
presents
for
decision
the
question
of
whether
the
enforcement
policy
of
the
federal
trade
commission
is
to
be
determined
by
the
commission
or
by
the
several
courts
of
appeals.
more
particularly,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
below
exceeded
the
proper
bounds
of
its
authority,
in
staying
the
commission's
order
that
universal-rundle
cease-and-desist
from
violations
of
the
robinson-patman
act
until
the
commission
makes
an
industry-wide
investigation
of
the
pricing
practices
of
universal-rundle's
competitors.
it
is
recognized
on
all
sides
i
believe,
that
the
issue
here
is
governed
by
this
courts
decision
in
moog
industries
which
held
that
the
commission's
determination
whether
or
not
to
withhold
the
cease-and-desist
order
until
competitors
are
proceeded
against,
is
not
to
be
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
absence
of
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion.
universal-rundle
is
a
manufacturer
of
plumbing
fixtures.
in
1957,
it
enjoyed
net
sales
of
approximately
$24
million.
it
sells
it
wares
to
some
8000
dealers
under
its
ur
brand
name.
in
addition,
it
sells
plumbing
fixtures
to
sears,
roebuck
and
company,
which
are
retailed
under
sears'
private
brand
homart.
sears
is
of
course
a
very
large
retailer.
its
annual
sales
volume
exceeds
$3
billion
and
sears,
roebuck
owned
some
60%
of
universal-rundle's
capital
stock
and
i
should
say
it
was
this
intimate
relationship
between
sears
and
rundle
that
led
initially
to
the
focusing
of
attention
on
rundle.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
does
not
because
it
was
eventually
determined
after
very
lengthy
hearings,
most
of
which
had
been
deleted
from
this
record
that
the
homart
and
the
ur
lines
were
not
of
like
grade
and
quality.
on
august
4,
1960,
the
trade
commission
issued
two
complaints
charging
sears
and
rundle
respectively
with
violations
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
complaint
against
rundle
alleged
that
rundle
was
violating
section
2
(a),
in
two
ways;
first,
by
selling
fixtures
to
sears
under
the
homart
brand
at
lower
prices
than
it
sold
its
ur
line
of
fixtures
to
competitors
of
sears
and
second,
by
selling
its
own
ur
line
at
different
prices
to
purchasers
competing
in
the
resale
of
the
ur
line.
a
motion
by
commission's
counsel
to
consolidate
the
two
cases
was
denied
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
hearings
were
then
commences
the
rundle
case
in
october
1962.
following
the
close
of
those
hearings,
the
examiner
found
as
i've
just
indicated
to
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
homart
and
ur
lines
were
not
of
like
grade
and
quality,
and
he
therefore
dismissed
so
much
of
the
complaint
as
charged
--
as
charged
rundle
with
discriminating
in
favor
of
sears.
with
respect
to
the
remainder
of
the
complaint,
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
rundle
sold
ur
brand
plumbing
fixtures
to
some
purchasers
in
the
philadelphia-camden
area
at
prices
substantially
below
those
charged
by
respondent
for
products
of
like
grade
and
quality
to
other
competing
purchasers
in
the
same
market
area.
he
also
found
that
in
the
competitive
circumstances
prevailing,
the
disfavored
dealers
were
likely
to
suffer
competitive
injury
if
rundle's
discriminatory
practices
were
to
continue
and
he
therefore
ordered
rundle
to
cease-and-desist
from
discriminating
in
price
between
customers
who
compete
in
fact
with
each
other
in
the
resale
of
rundle's
fixtures
other
than
the
homart
line.
on
cross-appeals
to
the
commission,
the
hearing
examiner's
initial
decision
was
affirmed
in
all
respects
that
are
relevant
here.
the
commission
rejected
rundle's
contention
that
the
requisite
injury
to
competition
had
not
been
shown.
in
particular,
the
commission
held
that
the
fact
that
price
differential
was
--
were
attributable
to
truckload
discounts
which
were
offered
to
all
customers
did
not
negate
competitive
injury
because
it
has
been
shown
that
truckload
discounts
were
beyond
--
the
truckload
quantities
were
beyond
the
buying
capabilities
of
some
of
the
customers.
the
commission's
final
order
was
issued
on
june
12,
1964
and
on
july
20,
1964
rundle
petitioned
the
commission
to
withdraw
that
order.
the
petition
also
prayed
that
reentry
of
the
order
be
stayed
for
18
months
that
it
be
reentered
only
on
30
days
notice
to
rundle,
and
that
an
immediate
temporary
stay
issue
pending
a
decision
on
the
petition.
the
petition
alleged
that
the
stay
was
sought
to
afford
the
commission
sufficient
time
to
investigate
and
institute
whatever
proceedings
are
deemed
appropriate
by
the
commission
to
correct
the
industry-wide
practice
of
granting
discounts
on
truckload
shippings.
the
petition
further
alleged
that
if
the
cease-and-desist
order
was
not
stayed
pending
corrective
action
of
industry-wide
practices,
rundle
would
suffer
competitive
disadvantage
and
extreme
hardship.
in
support
of
these
contentions,
rundle
attached
exhibits
indicating
that
its
six
principal
competitors,
all
offered
truckload
discounts.
it
also
urged
that
rundle's
market
share
exclusive
of
its
sales
to
sears
was
5.75%
ranking
sixth
in
the
industry
and
that
rundle
suffered
losses
in
the
proceeding
three
and
a
half
years
whereas
its
six
major
competitors
had
enjoyed
profits.
an
affidavit
of
rundle's
marketing
vice-president
stated
that
the
company
may
suffer
further
substantial
financial
losses
if
it
must
be
the
sole
plumbing
fixture
manufacturer
under
an
order
to
cease-and-desist.
the
commission
denied
the
petition.
in
doing
so,
it's
stated
that
the
fact
that
respondent
may
have
incurred
losses
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
order,
does
not
support
the
contention
that
enforcement
of
the
order
will
cause
a
financial
hardship.
it
also
stated
that
the
general
allegation
by
respondent
that
its
competitors
are
granting
truckload
discounts
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
--
instituting
industry-wide
proceedings
to
condemn
this
practice
nor
is
it
a
valid
reason
for
withholding
enforcement
of
the
cease-and-desist
order.
rundle
then
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
both
the
cease-and-desist
order
and
that
an
order
denying
the
stay.
the
court
of
appeals
reserved
decision
on
the
cease-and-desist
order.
accordingly,
the
merits
of
that
order
are
not
now
before
this
court.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
commission's
order
denying
rundle's
petition
for
a
stay.
the
court
found
that
the
commission
had
directed
its
attack
against
a
general
practice
which
is
prevalent
in
the
industry,
but
that
in
doing
so,
it
had
selected
one
who
share
in
the
market
is
less
than
60%
whose
discounts
were
lower
on
the
average
than
its
competitors'.
it
also
held
that
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right,
your
honor,
which
puts
us
in
a
--
puts
the
commission
in
a
particularly
awkward
position
as
i'm
sure
you
realize
because
we
may
have
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
so
we
pray.
it
held
that
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
this
case
your
honor.
as
i'm
trying
to
point
out
in
the
minute,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
rundle's
competitors
were
guilty,
more
guilty
than
rundle,
but
it
declined
to
determine
whether
rundle
was
guilty
and
i'm
sure
mr.
mcaleer
has
very
substantial
criticisms
of
the
order
on
the
merits
which
he
was
urging
also
before
the
court
and
which
hadn't
been
reached
or
which
have
to
be
decided
at
some
point.
under
the
--
i
should
just
add
at
this
point
that
under
the
decision,
the
commission
conceivably
could
launch
an
industry-wide
investigation
occupying
it
for
good
many
years,
and
come
back
to
find
that
its
original
order
against
rundle
is
in
some
respect
defective.
furthermore,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
order
of
the
commission
involved
the
sacrifice
of
a
comparatively
small
manufacture
when,
as
i
suggest,
when
as
i
have
suggested
it's
larger
and
more
guilty
competitors
“are
not
prosecuted.”
finally,
it
held
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
to
conduct
an
industry-wide
investigation
and
that
rundle's
showing
was
sufficient
to
require
the
commission
to
make
rundle's
competitors
parties
to
the
proceeding
against
rundle.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
started
from
mistaken
premises,
applied
an
unsound
legal
standard
and
produced
an
entirely
unworkable
result.
first
is
we've
just
alluded
too,
it
started
with
a
premise
that
rundle's
competitors
were
guilty.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
as
far
as
we
can
see,
as
far
as
the
commission
could
see
for
reaching
that
as
a
definitive
matter.
there
are
defenses.
there
are
individual
circumstances
that
have
to
be
shown
in
each
case,
a
violation
of
2
(a),
a
truckload
discount
is
not
a
per
se
violation
of
2
(a).
second,
the
court
accepted
at
face
value
rundle's
assertion
that
it
might
lose
business
if
the
commission's
order
is
not
stayed.
indeed,
the
court
--
the
court
apparently
concluded
sub
selentio
or
perhaps
ignored
the
question
that
the
harm
the
rundle
would
suffer
from
the
order
out
weighs
the
harm
its
competitors
would
suffer
--
i'm
sorry,
its
customers
would
suffer
from
staying
the
order.
after
all,
the
commission
had
determined
the
people
were
su
--
were
suffering
from
these
discriminatory
practices.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
evidence
that
rundle's
prediction
of
significant
injury
in
implausible.
thus,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
rundle
had
already
ceased
to
deal
with
the
smaller
customers
who
had
been
unable
to
purchase
in
truckload
quantities.
nor,
did
the
court
consider
that
under
the
commission's
order,
rundle
remained
free
to
grant
discounts
that
are
justified
by
lower
costs,
free
to
grant
discounts
to
meet
the
prices
--
prices
of
competitors
in
good
faith
and
free
to
grant
discounts
that
do
not
operate
to
discriminate
between
competing
customers.
and
i'd
particularly
like
to
stress
the
availability
even
under
the
order
of
the
good
faith
meeting
the
competition
defense
because
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
seem
to
have
focused
on
the
fact
that
rundle
pleaded
as
part
of
its
own
case,
good
faith
meeting
competition
and
then
for
reasons
which
it
alone
knows,
failed
to
prove
a
good
faith
meeting
a
competition.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
an
element
here
of
bringing
in
through
the
backdoor
what
one
couldn't
prove
or
didn't
prove
when
one
had
an
opportunity
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
is
true
that
i
--
that
even
if
we
assume
that
rundle's
competitors
were
all
violating
the
law,
much
more
egregiously
than
rundle,
the
commission
has
to
be
free
to
order
its
own
business
and
take
up
affairs,
make
investigations
when
as
in
if
it
gets
around
to
if
it
wants
to.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
that
has
happened.
i
do
think
that
it's
relevant,
that
rundle
is
not
without
remedy
if
the
facts
or
such,
although
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not.
rundle
is
perfectly
free
assuming
its
competitors
are
injuring
it
to
bring
treble
damage
actions,
to
bring
injunctive
actions
to
stop
that
sort
of
activity.
and
i
believe
that
the
commission
is
entitled
to
rely
in
some
measure
on
rundle's
determination
to
do
precisely
that.
that's
one
method
of
enforcing
the
law.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
this
is
a
2
(a)
case.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
if
rundle
is,
as
it
suggested,
will
be
injured
by
those
practices.
i
don't
see
why
there
isn't
a
treble
damage
action
and
an
injunctive
action.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
the
commission
under
this
court's
decision
in
moog
has
some
serious
responsibilities
which
are
its
responsibilities,
but
which
are
not
essentially
reviewable,
that
is
if
it
proceeds
on
a
--
as
long
as
it
proceeds
without
reference
to
consideration
that
have
no
rational
relation
to
a
legitimate
enforcement
policy,
i
know
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
should
think
that
the
commission
is
entitled
to
decide
that
it
will
proceed
against
a
few
firms
in
many
industries
or
many
firms
in
the
few
industries
or
lone
firm,
in
each
industry
that
that's
a
legitimate
policy
that
it
could
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
--
i
believe
that
the
sorts
of
allegations
that
rundle
has
made
are
on
their
face
not
the
sort
of
allegation
that
can
constitute
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
i
--
i
suppose
that
if
the
commission
were
to
say,
“we're
proceeding
against
firms
whose
stockholders
are
of
italian
ancestry
or
whose
directors
made
contributions
to
the
republican
party,”
that
would
be
i
think
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
there
are
probably
more
--
there
are
probably
other
examples
that
could
be
found,
but
i
do
think
that
the
words
in
moog
were
a
sort
of
saving
clause
dropped
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
against
the
possibilities
that
someday
a
very
outrageous
case
would
arise.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
i
want
to
advert
to
two
more
premises
that
the
court
proceeded
on
because
i
think
they
are
also
illustrative
of
the
difficulties
that
this
sort
of
review
gets
run
into,
because
after
all
this
comes
up
not
on
the
record
in
the
normal
sense.
this
isn't
a
review
to
see
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
supporting
that
commission
determination.
the
court
assumed
that
the
commission
has
wantonly
proceeded
against
one
of
the
smallest
of
a
group
of
violators.
indeed,
the
court
found
that
“the
industry
is
according
to
the
record
limited
to
a
few.
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
how
many
firms
there
are
in
this
industry.
the
record
does,
on
the
other
hand,
indicate
how
many
competitors
rundle
has
and
they
are
more
than
a
few.”
on
page
112
of
the
record,
rundle's
vice
president,
mr.
backner
named
17
firms
with
which
rundle
was
in
competition.
and
at
page
171,
mr.
backner
added
an
18th
and
indicated
that
there
were
perhaps
20,
25
or
more
such
firms.
yet,
the
court
below
apparently
focused
only
on
rundle's
six
largest
competitors.
it
failed
to
note
that
while
rundle
is
one
of
the
smaller
of
the
largest
firms,
it
is
nonetheless
larger
than
most
of
its
competitors.
but
the
court
adverted
to
the
fact
not
in
the
record
that
nearly
a
year
after
the
commission's
denial
of
the
stay,
the
commission's
counsel
informed
rundle's
counsel
that
an
investigation
could
not
then
be
undertaken
because
it
would
conflict
within
an
industry,
within
an
investigation
of
the
industry
being
conducted
by
the
antitrust
division.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
this
latter
investigation
as
somehow
not
qualifying
as
one
by
the
commission.
it
thus
leaves
the
commission
in
the
unhappy
--
with
the
unhappy
choice
between
letting
rundle
continue
with
unlawful
discriminations
or
launching
in
an
investigation
which
is
likely
to
immunize
defendants
and
thus
forwarded
two
pending
criminal
price-fixing
cases,
against
leading
members
of
the
plumbing
fixture
industry.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
pursuant
to
the
instructions
to
conduct
an
investigation,
the
commission
called
to
testify
any
officer
who
is
a
defendant
in
this
proceeding,
in
these
criminal
proceedings,
he
may
well
under
section
9
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
obtain
immunity.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
all
i
know
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
somewhat
to
the
antitrust
divisions
should
win
perhaps,
they
didn't
call
in
the
rundle
case
--
rundle's
vice
president
who
has
now
moved
to
dismiss
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
the
indictment
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
but
--
presumably,
the
investigation
of
the
interest
only
is
to
culminates
in
a
proceeding.
they
are
not
just
going
to
investigate
this
industry
to
inform
themselves
about
it.
they're
going
to
investigate
it
so
that
they
could
put
rundle
and
its
competitors
under
like
orders,
at
least
that's
the
relief
that
i
understand
rundle
wishes.
even
if
the
commission
were
to
undertake,
the
investigation
required
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
faced
with
a
whole
series
of
quandaries.
if
it
is
required
to
investigate
the
whole
industry,
however,
many
firms
that
maybe
or
only
those
20
or
30
firms
that
compete
with
rundle,
or
only
those
six
or
seven
firms
that
rundle
has
referred
to
in
its
petition,
how
thorough
must
an
investigation
be
to
satisfy
the
court
of
appeals?
must
it
be
nationwide
in
the
scope
or
limited
to
a
few
markets?
and
what
is
the
commission
to
do
if
after
investigating
this
industry
or
some
part
of
it,
it
concludes
that
there
is
no
basis
for
issuing
the
complaints
against
rundle's
competitors.
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
has
found
that
the
other
firms
are
violating
the
law
and
has
directed
that
the
cease-and-desist
order
against
rundle
be
stayed
pending
corrective
action.
these
dilemmas,
we
submit
are
merely
indicative
of
the
fundamental
difficulty
with
the
decision
below.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
suggest,
misunderstood
this
court's
holding
in
moog
industries,
that
the
commission's
determination
to
stay
or
not
to
stay,
a
remedial
order,
may
not
be
overturned
to
the
absence
of
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion.
we
suggest
that
a
court
of
appeals
can
properly
hold
that
an
administrative
agency
has
people
who
abused
with
this
discretion
only
if
it
finds
that
the
agency
has
based
its
decision
on
consideration
having
no
rational
relationship
to
the
relevant
statutory
policy
to
be
enforced.
no
such
finding
has
been
or
could
be
made
here.
as
i
have
suggested
in
our
judgment
within
the
scope
of
discretion
left
by
moog,
affirmed
by
moog,
a
commission
--
the
commission
is
free
to
decide
to
proceed
intensively
or
extensively
against
many
firms
in
a
few
industries
or
a
few
firms
in
many
industries,
is
free
to
decide
that
it
could
be
most
effective
by
proceeding
against
the
largest
firm
in
an
industry
or
the
most
typical
firm
in
an
industry.
and
it
can
elect,
i
submit,
to
make
an
example
of
one
violator
in
an
industry
in
the
hope
of
the
others
will
be
brought
around,
if
not
by
altruism,
then
by
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
the
order
or
the
threat
of
reality
of
private
treble
damage
actions
and
injunction
actions.
and
again,
the
commission
may
certainly
act
in
the
light
of
information
that
is
received
in
confidence
as
to
the
enforcement
plans
of
other
agencies
of
the
government.
all
of
these
choices,
whatever
their
wisdom
or
unwisdom
fall
well
within
the
area
of
discretion
committed
by
congress
to
the
commission
and
may
not
be
overturned
by
the
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
--
if
i
have
exactly
which
point
it
was.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
did
want
to
address
myself
to
one
question
they
raise
and
that
is
the
i
--
the
question
of
the
identity
of
the
systems
that
these
six
or
seven
companies
were
using.
i
submit
that
you
cannot
tell
from
the
record,
the
material
submitted
to
the
commission
whether
those
systems
are
identical.
you
can't
tell
to
what
the
--
the
discount
is
applied
and
therefore
you
can't
tell
where
you
come
out
at
the
other
end.
and
with
--
with
which
products
are
identical
with
which,
so
it's
very
hard
to
appraise
the
relative
sides
of
these
discounts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
but
the
--
the
--
the
critical
question
here
is
whether
it
has
to
launch
an
investigation
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
has
reason
to
believe.
and
it
obviously
receives
complaints
a
great
--
a
great
--
against
the
great
many
people
continuously
and
it's
continuously
in
the
position
of
having
to
appraise
which
of
these
deserves
its
attention.
i
don't
know
of
how
you
could
tell
just
from
the
face
of
the
allegations
made
by
rundle
which
–
that
it
is
the
most
meritorious
of
claims
presented
to
the
commission.
secondly,
it's
--
it
is
also
i
think
quite
clear
in
response
to
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
put,
i
think
also
the
chief
justice
that
the
commission
has
not
precluded
itself
forever
from
investigating
this
industry.
indeed,
in
the
very
correspondence
to
which
mr.
mcaleer
referred,
at
page
54
of
our
principal
brief,
the
commission's
counsel
wrote
to
mcaleer,
“in
the
meantime,
it
would
be
of
considerable
assistance
to
us
and
would
contribute
substantially
to
any
investigation
which
we
do
undertake
if
you
would
advise
me
if
the
reasons
they
then
have
used
which
your
client
has
for
believing
that
some
of
the
accounts
listed
in
the
exhibits
to
your
letter
buy
fixtures
from
such
and
such
firm.
finally,
all
of
the
things
that
the
court
indicated
in
moog
which
might
prompt
the
commission
to
investigate
this
matter
or
not
come
down
essentially
to
the
critical
factor
that
the
commission
alone
is
empowered
to
develop
its
enforcement
policy
and
to
allocate
its
resources.
this
--
the
court
below
ignored
that
teaching.
