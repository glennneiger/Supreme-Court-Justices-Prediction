justice

fortas
does
the
trade
commission
order
cover
the
homart
products
or
just
the
u.r.
products?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
--
you're
not
suggesting
to
us
are
you
that
rundle's
just
as
well
off
with
the
order
as
it
would
be
without
the
order?
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
that
--
is
that
important?
suppose
the
record
showed
beyond
any
possibility
of
argument,
that
rundle's
competitors
were
worse
than
rundle
was
and
all
of
the
relevant
respects
and
the
commission's
order
was
--
was
going
to
put
rundle
out
of
business
in
the
interest
of
its
competitors.
dose
that
make
any
difference
in
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
not
a
unique
situation
in
which
the
commission
has
selected
a
smaller
person
in
the
industry
which
they
have
standard
practices
and
--
for
the
proceeding
against
that
personal
--
that
company
and
left
its
larger
competitors
happily
doing
their
own
business
in
the
same
old
stance,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
does
rundle
have
a
remedy
against
its
competitors
in
the
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act?
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
this
is
--
this
is
a
2
(a)
case,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you're
telling
us
now
that
rundle
has
a
remedy
against
its
horizontal
competitors
in
the
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
allow
price
cutting
sales
or
discriminatory
sales
to
third
persons?
justice
abe
fortas
so
now
you
think
that
moog,
from
its
words
in
moog,
industry
is
meant?
justice
abe
fortas
or
some
members
of
this
court
may
phrase
it
a
little
different?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
get
that
immunity?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
when
you
said
it's
likely
to
immunizing?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
that
the
commission
usually
precedes
with
this?
justice
abe
fortas
and
why
--
why
would
they
have
to
call
these
people
for
re-trial
and
the
examination?
justice
abe
fortas
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
when
they
exchanged
to
the
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
it,
perhaps
this
is
wrong,
in
effect
what
the
court
did
was
to
say
that
that
the
commission
erred
in
denying
your
petition
that
it
undertake
an
industry-wide
investigation
and
that
meanwhile,
the
commission's
order
should
not
be
effective
against
it?
the
court
held
that
the
commission
erred,
but
the
court
said
we
will
not
decide
whether
the
cease-and-desist
order
against
universal-rundle
was
justified
until
after
the
completion
of
the
industry-wide
investigation
and
from
the
completion
of
the
industry-wide
investigation
presumably,
the
commission
could
have
broaden
the
universal-rundle
case
to
include
the
other
respondents
or
i
suppose
the
court
might
have
thought
that
upon
the
completion
of
the
industry-wide
investigation
the
commission
could
show
the
court
that
nobody
else
should
have
been
joined.
is
that
about
the
way
you
make
it
out?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
like
this
in
the
books?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals
never
done
anything
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.

is
there
any
provision
in

that
