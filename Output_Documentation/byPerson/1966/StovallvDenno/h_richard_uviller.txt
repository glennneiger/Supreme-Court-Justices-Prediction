mr.
h.
richard
uviller
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
heard
my
very
good
friend
mr.
polsky
and
also
mr.
fulcon(ph)
say
that
they
would
have
liked
to
have
been
present
as
counsel
at
the
time
of
these
identifications.
and
indeed
they
have
suggested
what
they
might
have
thought
have
to
do,
how
they
might
have
benefited
their
clients
had
they
been
present.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
not
obedient
to
the
desires
of
counsel
to
be
present
or
from
the
contingent
benefit
that
a
defendant
might
have
received
had
counsel
been
present.
there
are
many
incidents
in
the
preparation
of
a
case
by
the
prosecution
either
before
or
after
indictment
at
which
had
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
been
present,
he
might
have
benefited
his
client's
interest,
where
a
prosecutor
for
example
interrogate
a
witness
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant.
clearly
counsel
if
he
were
present
might
cross-examine
that
witness
or
interrogate
him
as
well
and
perhaps
have
that
witness
change
his
testimony
to
benefit
the
interest
of
the
defendant.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
his
office,
in
the
police
station
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
in
his
own
home.
during
these
preparatory
phases
of
the
prosecution's
obligation,
no
one
has
suggested
and
i
don't
think
the
counsel
here
today
would
suggest
that
the
defense
counsel
has
the
right
to
be
present.
does
it
change
because
the
defendant's
body
is
there
because
the
conversation
between
the
prosecutor
takes
place
--
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
witness
takes
place
in
the
physical
presence
of
the
defendant.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
and
there
is
a
very
vital
difference
between
inspection
of
the
body,
movement
of
the
muscles,
use
of
the
vocal
chords
by
a
defendant
and
the
interrogation
of
that
defendant.
and
i
think
that
is
the
principle
import
of
the
schmerber
decision.
it
wasn't
--
divide
a
court,
but
i
think
that
the
majority
opinion
was
quite
explicit
on
this
particular
phase
of
the
use
of
the
defendant
against
himself
or
the
use
of
some
facet
of
his
physical
characteristics.
the
language
is
that
it
was
the
schmerber
case
itself,
that
voice
timbre
or
the
use
of
words
for
identification
purposes
is
not
a
testimonial
communication
such
as
that
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
sixth
amendment
question
purely.
and
the
sixth
amendment
question
depends
upon
the
limits
which
are
given
to
the
right
of
an
accused
to
have
his
counsel
--
the
assistance
of
his
counsel
before
his
defense.
i
submit
to
the
court
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
limits
to
that
right.
he
comes
into
existence
when
a
man
becomes
an
accused
and
clearly
stovall
wasn't
accused
at
the
time
of
the
confrontation
in
the
hospital
room.
he
did
have
the
right
to
whatever
protection
the
sixth
amendment
offered
him
as
of
that
moment.
but
it
is
nonetheless
incumbent
upon
the
court
i
believe
to
define
the
extent
of
that
protection.
and
if
we
start
from
the
premise
that
there
are
limits,
there
are
things
that
may
occur
where
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
his
counsel,
even
though
it
may
be
to
his
detriment
not
to
have
counsel,
even
though
the
counsel
may
have
suggestions
to
that,
then
i
think
it
becomes
very
close
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
the
court
below
has
held
that
there
was
no
legal
service
for
counsel
to
perform.
counsel
could
have
made
suggestions,
counsel
could
have
told
his
defendant
not
to
say
anything,
not
to
allow
his
voice
to
be
used
for
identification.
but
a
very
important
teaching
of
schmerber,
i
submit
is
that
counsel
cannot
create
a
right
by
asserting
and
a
counsel
does
not
have
the
right
if
the
client
does
not
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
to
withhold
his
voice
as
he
might
cover
his
face
with
his
hands.
then
the
mere
fact
that
counsel
might
advise
him
to
do
so
does
not
create
that
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
that
is
the
unanswered
question
i
believe
justice
white
in
schmerber.
the
same
thing
is
true
there.
what
if
the
defendant
just
physically
refuses
to
give
the
blood?
he
has
no
right
to
refuse
to
give
it
but
how
much
force
can
be
used
to
extract
it
from
him.and
i
think
the
implication
of
schmerber
is
clear
and
that
is
that
if
force
--
if
brutality
is
used
in
any
way
to
force
the
defendant
to
comply
even
though
he
has
no
right
to
refuse,
one
has
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
a
due
process
question,
a
rochin
situation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
is
really
the
nut
of
my
point.
my
point
is
that
counsel
the
services
of
counsel,
the
assistance
of
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
does
not
embrace
telling
the
defendant
to
do
something
in
his
interests
which
he
does
not
have
a
right,
a
constitutional
-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
or
statutory
rights
to
do.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
he
has
no
right
to
refuse
to
do.
i
might
--
my
--
i
would
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
we
have
to
be
--
we
have
to
--
the
only
way
that
this
unanswerable
question
can
possibly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it
was
certainly
unanswered
in
--
and
was
left
to
one
side
in
schmerber
for
all
of
these
reasons
which
are
different,
very
difficult
question.
i
think
we
have
to
take
two
contentions.
either
the
defendant
does
comply
and
answers
or
gives
his
blood
or
let
his
voice
be
used,
in
which
case
the
question
is,
has
any
violation
of
his
constitutional
and
statutory
rights
been
accomplished
in
that
instance.
the
answer
here
is
no.
or
he
voluntarily
refuses
in
which
case
the
question
is
quite
different,
that
is
what
may
be
constitutionally
done
to
unrefuse
him,
to
loosen
up
the
--
this
particular
kind
of
evidence.
and
i
think
there
are
two
separate
questions.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
counsel
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
has
the
right
to
transform
the
question
from
one
type
into
the
other.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
my
answer
to
that
justice
fortas
would
be
this.
his
mother
could
have
told
him
that
too.
i
did
not
view
that
that
sort
of
advice
as
the
kind
of
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense
which
the
sixth
amendment
commands.
it
is
not
simply
that
the
defendant
could
derive
a
benefit
whether
the
presence
of
counsel
might
help
him
or
the
counsel
might
think
of
something
could
tell
him
what
to
do
that
gives
him
the
right
to
have
counsel
present.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
he
would
have
the
right
to
have
counsel
after
indictment
in
all
phases
of
the
prosecution's
investigation
in
preparation
for
trial,
when
the
interview
--
when
they
took
the
fingernail
scraping,
from
under
stovall's
fingers
in
this
case,
counsel
might
have
been
there
to
say,
"you
missed
the
thumb",
and
that
might
have
helped
him
tremendously.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
it's
the
sixth
amendment
case
justice
harlan.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right
sir,
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
they
could
have
excluded
him.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
this
--
the
con
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel
pertains
only
in
courtroom
situations
except
in
three
cases,
escobedo,
which
was
a
pre-indictment,
pre-arraignment
case
which
i
think
has
been
somewhat
modified
by
miranda
and
the
spano-massiah
line.
now
the
spano-massiah
line
is
clearly
testimonial.
both
cases
involved
the
interrogation
of
the
defendant
and
the
use
against
him
of
evidence
obtained
by
him,
from
him
rather,
by
some
sort
of
official
trickery.
and
we
are
suggesting
that
the
massiah
doctrine
which
accords
the
right
to
counsel
outside
the
courtroom
should
not
be
applicable
to
any
situation
other
than
one
where
evidence
is
sort
of
a
testimonial
nature
from
the
person
or
the
defendant
himself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
we
do
know
that
from
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
testimony
was
that
he
was
asked
to
speak
certain
words
for
identification.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
detectives
on
cross-examination
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
because
these
words
were
not
used
against
the
defendant.
the
very
fact
that
we
don't
know
the
words
indicates
to
me
that
they're
not
testimonial
evidence.
they're
not
evidence
of
a
testimonial
communication.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
the
record
doesn't
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
because
it
wasn't
used
at
the
trial
against
him.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
i
would
answer
that
the
same
way
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
the
gilbert
case,
the
state
case
which
is
before
the
court
today,
those
answers
made
by
the
defendant
were
not
used
against
him
either.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
because
they
weren't
proved
at
the
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
if
there
had
been
--
there
might
have
to
be
an
inquiry
into
that.
that
is
to
say
if
the
police
learned
anything
on
basis
of
which
they
obtained
other
evidence,
then
there
might
be
a
suppression
question
on
the
wong
sun,
as
if
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
wong
sun
question,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
record
in
this
case,
the
stovall
case,
or
from
what
i
know
of
the
gilbert
case
presents
a
wong
sun
question.
there
was
never
any
piece
of
evidence
that
was
attacked
as
the
fruit
of
anything
that
has
been
learned
in
this
post
indictment
on
counsel
interrogation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
in
our
jurisdiction
it's
done
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
that
before
or
during
the
trial
and
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
which
is
alleged
to
be
the
fruits
of
an
unconstitutional
interrogation.
i
would
say
that
the
absence
from
the
records
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
of
any
allegation
of
a
wong
sun
nature
precludes
the
court
from
considering
the
possibility
that
some
evidence
might
have
been
the
fruit
of
an
interrogation.
certainly
in
the
stovall
case,
there's
absolutely
no
justification
that
i
believe
at
all,
and
i
dare
say
the
same
is
true
in
the
gilbert
record.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
thank
you.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i

to
suggest

question,
a
rochin
situation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
is
really
the
nut
of
my
point.
my
point
is
that
counsel
the
services
of
counsel,
the
assistance
of
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
does
not
embrace
telling
the
defendant
to
do
something
in
his
interests
which
he
does
not
have
a
right,
a
constitutional
-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
or
statutory
rights
to
do.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
he
has
no
right
to
refuse
to
do.
i
might
--
my
--
i
would
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
we
have
to
be
--
we
have
to
--
the
only
way
that
this
unanswerable
question
can
possibly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it
was
certainly
unanswered
in
--
and
was
left
to
one
side
in
schmerber
for
all
of
these
reasons
which
are
different,
very
difficult
question.
i
think
we
have
to
take
two
contentions.
either
the
defendant
does
comply
and
answers
or
gives
his
blood
or
let
his
voice
be
used,
in
which
case
the
question
is,
has
any
violation
of
his
constitutional
and
statutory
rights
been
accomplished
in
that
instance.
the
answer
here
is
no.
or
he
voluntarily
refuses
in
which
case
the
question
is
quite
different,
that
is
what
may
be
constitutionally
done
to
unrefuse
him,
to
loosen
up
the
--
this
particular
kind
of
evidence.
and
i
think
there
are
two
separate
questions.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
counsel
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
has
the
right
to
transform
the
question
from
one
type
into
the
other.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
my
answer
to
that
justice
fortas
would
be
this.
his
mother
could
have
told
him
that
too.
i
did
not
view
that
that
sort
of
advice
as
the
kind
of
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense
which
the
sixth
amendment
commands.
it
is
not
simply
that
the
defendant
could
derive
a
benefit
whether
the
presence
of
counsel
might
help
him
or
the
counsel
might
think
of
something
could
tell
him
what
to
do
that
gives
him
the
right
to
have
counsel
present.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
he
would
have
the
right
to
have
counsel
after
indictment
in
all
phases
of
the
prosecution's
investigation
in
preparation
for
trial,
when
the
interview
--
when
they
took
the
fingernail
scraping,
from
under
stovall's
fingers
in
this
case,
counsel
might
have
been
there
to
say,
"you
missed
the
thumb",
and
that
might
have
helped
him
tremendously.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
it's
the
sixth
amendment
case
justice
harlan.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right
sir,
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
they
could
have
excluded
him.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
this
--
the
con
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel
pertains
only
in
courtroom
situations
except
in
three
cases,
escobedo,
which
was
a
pre-indictment,
pre-arraignment
case
which
i
think
has
been
somewhat
modified
by
miranda
and
the
spano-massiah
line.
now
the
spano-massiah
line
is
clearly
testimonial.
both
cases
involved
the
interrogation
of
the
defendant
and
the
use
against
him
of
evidence
obtained
by
him,
from
him
rather,
by
some
sort
of
official
trickery.
and
we
are
suggesting
that
the
massiah
doctrine
which
accords
the
right
to
counsel
outside
the
courtroom
should
not
be
applicable
to
any
situation
other
than
one
where
evidence
is
sort
of
a
testimonial
nature
from
the
person
or
the
defendant
himself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
we
do
know
that
from
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
testimony
was
that
he
was
asked
to
speak
certain
words
for
identification.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
detectives
on
cross-examination
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so,
because
these
words
were
not
used
against
the
defendant.
the
very
fact
that
we
don't
know
the
words
indicates
to
me
that
they're
not
testimonial
evidence.
they're
not
evidence
of
a
testimonial
communication.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
the
record
doesn't
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
because
it
wasn't
used
at
the
trial
against
him.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
i
would
answer
that
the
same
way
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
the
gilbert
case,
the
state
case
which
is
before
the
court
today,
those
answers
made
by
the
defendant
were
not
used
against
him
either.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
because
they
weren't
proved
at
the
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
if
there
had
been
--
there
might
have
to
be
an
inquiry
into
that.
that
is
to
say
if
the
police
learned
anything
on
basis
of
which
they
obtained
other
evidence,
then
there
might
be
a
suppression
question
on
the
wong
sun,
as
if
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
wong
sun
question,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
record
in
this
case,
the
stovall
case,
or
from
what
i
know
of
the
gilbert
case
presents
a
wong
sun
question.
there
was
never
any
piece
of
evidence
that
was
attacked
as
the
fruit
of
anything
that
has
been
learned
in
this
post
indictment
on
counsel
interrogation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
in
our
jurisdiction
it's
done
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
that
before
or
during
the
trial
and
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
which
is
alleged
to
be
the
fruits
of
an
unconstitutional
interrogation.
i
would
say
that
the
absence
from
the
records
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
of
any
allegation
of
a
wong
sun
nature
precludes
the
court
from
considering
the
possibility
that
some
evidence
might
have
been
the
fruit
of
an
interrogation.
certainly
in
the
stovall
case,
there's
absolutely
no
justification
that
i
believe
at
all,
and
i
dare
say
the
same
is
true
in
the
gilbert
record.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
thank
you.
