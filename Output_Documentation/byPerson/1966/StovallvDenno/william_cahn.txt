mr.
william
cahn
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases.
may
i
first
correct
counsel
by
stating
that
the
first
evidentiary
matter
in
reference
to
the
prior
identification
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel
on
cross-examination
of
the
state's
witness.
this
was
the
first
time
in
testimony
that
the
circumstances
of
the
prior
identification
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
it
is
true
that
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
mentioned
the
fact
that
mrs.
behrendt
had
identified
the
defendant
in
her
hospital
room
approximately
36
hours
after
the
crime
and
that
he
did
not
know
whether
or
not
she
could
identify
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
which
in
fact
she
did.
and
may
i
point
out
to
the
--
this
honorable
body
that
each
and
every
time
a
witness
points
to
the
defendant
at
defense
table,
and
i'm
certain
that
each
and
every
witness
knows
where
the
defendant
sits,
he
sits
alone
with
his
counsel
each
and
every
time
she
or
he
lifts
a
finger
and
points
to
the
defendant
at
the
defense
counsel
and
says,
"that
is
the
man",
that
type
of
testimony
is
exactly
what
took
place
in
the
hospital,
in
garden
city,
new
york.
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
justice
fortas
i
don't
think
the
presence
of
the
attorney
whether
in
court
or
out
of
court
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
william
cahn
and
certain
--
mr.
william
cahn
and
so
would
i,
sir.
may
i
say
that
the
one
classification
of
evidence
which
is
unrestricted
or
remains
the
least
restricted
by
statutes
and
court
decision
is
eyewitness
testimony.
it
is
important
testimony
restricted
indeed
by
the
weight
a
jury
wishes
to
place
upon
it
and
the
credibility
a
jury
wishes
to
give
to
the
witness.
in
this
particular
case,
the
one
eyewitness
was
the
widow
of
the
slain
doctor
who
herself
was
a
victim
of
11
slashes
of
the
defendant's
knife,
two
of
which
were
near
fatal.
she
was
physically
and
mentally
incapable
of
making
any
identification
which
obviously
would
be
of
great
import
to
this
case.
approximately
36
hours
later
after
arraignment,
the
defendant
was
brought
to
the
hospital
room
where
mrs.
behrendt,
the
wife
of
the
deceased
was
able
to
make
identification.
again,
she
was
the
only
witness
who
could
completely
exonerate
this
defendant.
and
because
of
this
identification
we
are
here
this
afternoon
and
may
i
say
this
that
i
much
prefer
standing
before
this
august
body
explaining
why
we
made
the
identification
rather
than
having
had
mrs.
behrendt
die
and
she
was
hovering
between
life
and
death,
having
had
her
die
and
explain
to
this
court
why
we
didn't
have
an
identification
made.
it
is
clean
in
the
briefs
of
counsel
that
the
identification
itself
constituted
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
people
against
schmerber
--
schmerber
against
california
excuse
me,
reiterates
the
concept
of
law
that
testimonial
compulsion
relates
to
oral
and
written
testimony
of
the
accused
and
that
identification
is
not
so
classified.
no
one
can
deny
that
identification
is
an
important
weapon
of
the
defense,
at
some
times
is
vital.
and
therefore,
if
there
were
no
fifth
--
if
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem
to
be
considered,
where
then
does
the
sixth
amendment
come
into
play.
what
could
counsel
do?
all
of
the
suggestions
related
by
counsel
in
this
case
and
the
previous
cases
referred
to
suggestions
of
procedure.
i
might
have
told
the
prosecutor
to
have
five
men
in
the
lineup
rather
than
three,
10
men
rather
than
five.
i
might
not
have
had
the
defendant
walk
this
way.
i
might
have
had
him
walk
that
way.
may
i
suggest
that
these
are
suggestions
as
to
police
procedures
but
give
no
rise
to
the
rights
of
the
defendant.
no
right
to
the
counsel
to
suggest
this
and
certainly
gives
no
right
under
the
sixth
amendment.
there
would
be
no
legal
assistance
as
in
the
hamilton
and
in
the
white
case
to
which
counsel
previously
referred.
their
legal
assistance
for
the
defendant
was
mighty
important,
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
was
being
done
--
investigation
which
certainly
can
survive
an
arraignment
which
certainly
survives
an
indictment,
which
certainly
survives
even
the
trial
itself
because
no
--
at
no
time,
the
people
precluded
from
making
further
investigation
and
very
often
it
happens
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
therefore
there
was
no
legal
assistance
which
a
counsel
could
afford
defendant
in
no
way,
and
therefore
it
does
not
give
rise
to
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
cahn
in
what
way
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
william
cahn
sir,
there
is
nowhere
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
this
defendant
was
interrogated
in
any
way
at
this
identification.
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
respectfully
say
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
respectfully
say
that
no
legal
assistance
could
be
offered,
yes
sir.
this
is
my
opinion
of
the
schmerber
case
because
if
that
was
true,
certainly
an
attorney
could
have
said
in
the
schmerber
case
i
would
want
you
to
wait
until
this
defendant's
own
doctor
could
take
his
blood
or
at
least
have
his
own
doctor
present.
i
would
want
perhaps
for
you
to
take
a
urine
analysis,
in
addition
to
blood
or
instead
of
blood,
but
these
again
are
only
suggestions
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
as
to
procedure.
mr.
william
cahn
but,
insofar
as
the
case
--
mr.
william
cahn
where
the
defendant's
health
or
safety
is
not
put
in
jeopardy,
where
he
is
not
interrogated
to
a
point
or
to
any
point,
where
his
presence
is
for
the
purpose
of
purely
investigation,
and
his
health
and
safety
and
body
is
fully
protected,
i
can
see
no
purpose
for
legal
assistance
of
counsel
insofar
as
the
defendant
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
is
concerned.
mr.
william
cahn
there
is
no
objection
to
the
lawyer
being
there
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
cahn
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
he
had
no
lawyer
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
his
arraignment
was
adjourned
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
an
attorney.
this
was
a
question
of
emergency.
we
did
not
know
whether
mrs.
behrendt
would
live
or
die,
so
he
was
immediately
taken
without
the
aid
of
counsel
because
we
saw
no
constitutional
right.
mr.
william
cahn
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
i
think
he
would
have
had
to
--
have
been
rearrested
and
as
long
as
he
was
out
on
bond,
i
don't
think
we
could
have
done
that.
mr.
william
cahn
he
was
in
custody--
mr.
william
cahn
no
more
than
--
if
he
--
if
mrs.
behrendt
were
able
to
come
to
the
district
court
where
he
was
arraigned
and
make
identification,
i
think
this
would
have
been
proper
or
if
he
were
out
on
the
street
and
mrs.
behrendt
were
physically
able
to
do
so,
she
could
have
made
identification
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
out
on
the
street,
if
this
however
--
mr.
william
cahn
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
he
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
help?
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
he
helped
us
make
a
case
against
himself?
i
do
not
believe
that
this
comes
under
the
constitutional
concept
of
self-incrimination
by
his
mere
presence
there.
he
--
by
going
with
us
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
of
course
it
was
a
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes
and
it
also
provided
him
an
opportunity
to
be
completely
exonerated.
and
if
we
have
to
wait
until
mrs.
behrendt
was
physically
able
to
do
so,
then
she
would
have
been
brought
to
the
jail
or
brought
to
a
court
at
his
further
arraignment
and
the
same
thing
would
have
been
accomplished.
now,
insofar
as
the
results
of
this
prior
identification
is
concerned
--
what
took
place,
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
they
made
him
say
certain
words.
they
asked
him
to
say
certain
words.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
i
believe
he
could
have.
i
believe
the
schmerber
case
stands
for
that
and
i
believe
a
line
of
new
york
state
cases
stands
for
that.
we've
had
incidents
where
they
were
asked
to
put
on
certain
clothing,
where
they're
asked
to
even
shave
or
to
--
if
he
had
a
scar
on
his
chest
and
that
was
the
subject
of
an
identity
by
a
witness,
i
think
he
could
have
been
asked
to
remove
his
shirt
in
court
with
whether
the
counsel
objected
or
not
and
--
so
that
the,
let's
say
a
scar
or
a
tattoo
could
have
been
identified
by
the
witness.
if
he
had
--
if
it
was
noticed
that
he
had
11
toes,
i
think
he
could
have
been
asked
to
take
off
his
shoe
in
court
whether
counsel
objected
or
not.
i
think
the
line
of
cases
so
hold
and
i
think
that
concept
of
law
is
reiterated
in
the
schmerber
case.
mr.
william
cahn
as
far
as
the
words
are
concerned
at
no
time
where
any
of
these
words
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury,
it
was
clear
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear
and
the
counsel
mentioned
that
these
words
were
stated
purely
for
the
identification
of
the
voice
and
in
no
way
was
the
defendant
interrogated.
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
suggest
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it's
the
words
he
were
forced
to
say
were,
i
committed
the
crime
and
this
method
was
brought
before
the
attention
of
the
jury,
to
what
benefit
or
to
what
detriment
would
it
have
been
to
the
defendant
and
those
were
not
the
words
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
can't
argue
with
the
--
justice
fortas,
on
that.
there
--
that
there
might
have
been
a
natural
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
tendency
to
so.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
well
--
mr.
william
cahn
as
i
--
yes,
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
testimonial
compulsion
i
believe
that
is
set
out
in
the
schmerber
case
relates
to
--
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
there
are
no
questions
--
mr.
william
cahn
there
is
no
question
that
if
this
defendant
were
interrogated
rather
than
merely
to
ask
to
say
words,
there
might
have
been
a
very
definite
violation.
but
this
was
not
the
case,
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
record
that
this
defendant
was
interrogated
or
asked
about
the
crime
and
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
there
was
no
confession
here,
none
whatsoever.
insofar
as
due
process
is
concerned,
the
method
of
identification
in
no
way
shocks
the
conscience
of
mankind
or
falls
below
the
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
as
i
pointed
out
to
this
illustrious
body
before,
each
and
every
time
whether
an
attorney
is
present
or
not
a
witness
who
knows
where
the
defendant
sits
who
perhaps
sometimes
in
court
is
shackled
and
who
sees
him
go
and
come
at
recesses
perhaps
handcuffed
to
the
marshals
of
the
court,
sits
down
and
says,
yes,
there
is
the
man
this
same
process
is
done
each
and
every
time.
and
this
too,
in
no
way
violates
the
conscience
of
mankind
or
falls
below
the
standards
of
due
process
as
set
out
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
testimony
is
indeed
extremely
important.
viewing
the
defendant
alone
very,
very
often
happens
as
a
matter
of
fact,
very
often
becomes
the
subject
of
probable
cause
of
arrest,
if
a
person
is
robbed
and
10
minutes
later,
sees
a
police
officer,
and
complainants
of
the
robbery,
walks
down
the
street
and
says,
there
is
the
man
who
is
walking
alone,
this
is
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
--
mr.
william
cahn
no
question
in
my
mind,
your
honor,
there
would
have
been
a
case
but
may
i
repeat
that
the
first
testimonial
inference
of
this
prior
identification
came
as
a
result
of
cross-examination
by
defense
counsel
of
the
people's
witness.
the
only
time
it
was
mentioned
first
was
in
the
opening
of
the
assistant
district
attorney.
further,
the
prior
identification
became
the
basis
of
attack
for
mrs.
behrendt's
identification
in
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
foundation
was
laid
by
the
defendant
himself
and
he
almost
rested
his
case
on
indicating
that
her
identification
in
court
was
as
the
result
of
this
prior
identification
over
a
year
ago
in
the
hospital
room.
mr.
william
cahn
to
properly
care
for
the
safety
and
health
of
the
defendant.
i
don't
think
he
has
--
that
to
see
that
he's
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
properly
fit
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
see
no
constitutional
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
question
--
mr.
william
cahn
well
it
may
if
--
may
i
explain
something
mr.
justice
black
that
in
nassau
county
where
the
judge
places
the
defendant
in
custody
of
the
sheriff,
it
is
the
police
who
take
the
defendant
to
the
jail
and
place
him
into
the
custody
of
a
sheriff.
there
was
no
--
he
didn't
go
to
the
jail
first.
there
was
a
stop
off
at
the
hospital.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
to
do
nothing
to
him
--
mr.
william
cahn
that
would
harm
him.
that
is
correct
sir.
and
in
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
certainly
agree
with
mr.
justice
black,
yes
sir.
it
is
a
very
good
policy
and
i
state
that,
in
no
way
that
this
identification
harmed
the
defendant
because
it
just
delayed
his
identification
and
in
fact
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes,
it
did
in
this
particular
instance
but
may
i
point
out
to
mr.
justice
black
that
it
could
also
had
resulted
in
his
complete
exoneration.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
it
can
be
done
sir.
i
see
no
restriction
against
it
and
may
i
point
this
out
--
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
where?
in
a
civilized
state
mr.
justice
black
and
there
are
certain
limitations
which
are
placed
upon
sheriffs,
law
enforcement
officers
or
custodians
of
prisoners.
there
are
certain
limitations
which
must
have
necessity,
be
adhered
to
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
cahn
no
sir,
not
in
those
very
terms.
but
in
this
case
may
i
point
out
that
it
would
have
just
delayed
it,
it
would
have
meant
mrs.
behrendt
getting
physically
well
enough
to
come
over
to
the
jail
and
view
the
body.
the
viewing
itself
is
the
essence
and
the
pit
of
this
particular
question
and
i
think
no
harm
whatsoever
was
done
to
the
prisoner
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
just
a
stop
off
before
going
to
jail.
thank
you.
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases.
may
i
first
correct
counsel
by
stating
that
the
first
evidentiary
matter
in
reference
to
the
prior
identification
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel
on
cross-examination
of
the
state's
witness.
this
was
the
first
time
in
testimony
that
the
circumstances
of
the
prior
identification
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
it
is
true
that
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
mentioned
the
fact
that
mrs.
behrendt
had
identified
the
defendant
in
her
hospital
room
approximately
36
hours
after
the
crime
and
that
he
did
not
know
whether
or
not
she
could
identify
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
which
in
fact
she
did.
and
may
i
point
out
to
the
--
this
honorable
body
that
each
and
every
time
a
witness
points
to
the
defendant
at
defense
table,
and
i'm
certain
that
each
and
every
witness
knows
where
the
defendant
sits,
he
sits
alone
with
his
counsel
each
and
every
time
she
or
he
lifts
a
finger
and
points
to
the
defendant
at
the
defense
counsel
and
says,
"that
is
the
man",
that
type
of
testimony
is
exactly
what
took
place
in
the
hospital,
in
garden
city,
new
york.
mr.
william
cahn
mr.
justice
fortas
i
don't
think
the
presence
of
the
attorney
whether
in
court
or
out
of
court
gives
rise
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
william
cahn
and
certain
--
mr.
william
cahn
and
so
would
i,
sir.
may
i
say
that
the
one
classification
of
evidence
which
is
unrestricted
or
remains
the
least
restricted
by
statutes
and
court
decision
is
eyewitness
testimony.
it
is
important
testimony
restricted
indeed
by
the
weight
a
jury
wishes
to
place
upon
it
and
the
credibility
a
jury
wishes
to
give
to
the
witness.
in
this
particular
case,
the
one
eyewitness
was
the
widow
of
the
slain
doctor
who
herself
was
a
victim
of
11
slashes
of
the
defendant's
knife,
two
of
which
were
near
fatal.
she
was
physically
and
mentally
incapable
of
making
any
identification
which
obviously
would
be
of
great
import
to
this
case.
approximately
36
hours
later
after
arraignment,
the
defendant
was
brought
to
the
hospital
room
where
mrs.
behrendt,
the
wife
of
the
deceased
was
able
to
make
identification.
again,
she
was
the
only
witness
who
could
completely
exonerate
this
defendant.
and
because
of
this
identification
we
are
here
this
afternoon
and
may
i
say
this
that
i
much
prefer
standing
before
this
august
body
explaining
why
we
made
the
identification
rather
than
having
had
mrs.
behrendt
die
and
she
was
hovering
between
life
and
death,
having
had
her
die
and
explain
to
this
court
why
we
didn't
have
an
identification
made.
it
is
clean
in
the
briefs
of
counsel
that
the
identification
itself
constituted
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
people
against
schmerber
--
schmerber
against
california
excuse
me,
reiterates
the
concept
of
law
that
testimonial
compulsion
relates
to
oral
and
written
testimony
of
the
accused
and
that
identification
is
not
so
classified.
no
one
can
deny
that
identification
is
an
important
weapon
of
the
defense,
at
some
times
is
vital.
and
therefore,
if
there
were
no
fifth
--
if
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem
to
be
considered,
where
then
does
the
sixth
amendment
come
into
play.
what
could
counsel
do?
all
of
the
suggestions
related
by
counsel
in
this
case
and
the
previous
cases
referred
to
suggestions
of
procedure.
i
might
have
told
the
prosecutor
to
have
five
men
in
the
lineup
rather
than
three,
10
men
rather
than
five.
i
might
not
have
had
the
defendant
walk
this
way.
i
might
have
had
him
walk
that
way.
may
i
suggest
that
these
are
suggestions
as
to
police
procedures
but
give
no
rise
to
the
rights
of
the
defendant.
no
right
to
the
counsel
to
suggest
this
and
certainly
gives
no
right
under
the
sixth
amendment.
there
would
be
no
legal
assistance
as
in
the
hamilton
and
in
the
white
case
to
which
counsel
previously
referred.
their
legal
assistance
for
the
defendant
was
mighty
important,
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
was
being
done
--
investigation
which
certainly
can
survive
an
arraignment
which
certainly
survives
an
indictment,
which
certainly
survives
even
the
trial
itself
because
no
--
at
no
time,
the
people
precluded
from
making
further
investigation
and
very
often
it
happens
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
therefore
there
was
no
legal
assistance
which
a
counsel
could
afford
defendant
in
no
way,
and
therefore
it
does
not
give
rise
to
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
cahn
in
what
way
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
william
cahn
sir,
there
is
nowhere
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
this
defendant
was
interrogated
in
any
way
at
this
identification.
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
respectfully
say
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
respectfully
say
that
no
legal
assistance
could
be
offered,
yes
sir.
this
is
my
opinion
of
the
schmerber
case
because
if
that
was
true,
certainly
an
attorney
could
have
said
in
the
schmerber
case
i
would
want
you
to
wait
until
this
defendant's
own
doctor
could
take
his
blood
or
at
least
have
his
own
doctor
present.
i
would
want
perhaps
for
you
to
take
a
urine
analysis,
in
addition
to
blood
or
instead
of
blood,
but
these
again
are
only
suggestions
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
as
to
procedure.
mr.
william
cahn
but,
insofar
as
the
case
--
mr.
william
cahn
where
the
defendant's
health
or
safety
is
not
put
in
jeopardy,
where
he
is
not
interrogated
to
a
point
or
to
any
point,
where
his
presence
is
for
the
purpose
of
purely
investigation,
and
his
health
and
safety
and
body
is
fully
protected,
i
can
see
no
purpose
for
legal
assistance
of
counsel
insofar
as
the
defendant
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
is
concerned.
mr.
william
cahn
there
is
no
objection
to
the
lawyer
being
there
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
cahn
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
he
had
no
lawyer
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
his
arraignment
was
adjourned
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
an
attorney.
this
was
a
question
of
emergency.
we
did
not
know
whether
mrs.
behrendt
would
live
or
die,
so
he
was
immediately
taken
without
the
aid
of
counsel
because
we
saw
no
constitutional
right.
mr.
william
cahn
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
no,
i
think
he
would
have
had
to
--
have
been
rearrested
and
as
long
as
he
was
out
on
bond,
i
don't
think
we
could
have
done
that.
mr.
william
cahn
he
was
in
custody--
mr.
william
cahn
no
more
than
--
if
he
--
if
mrs.
behrendt
were
able
to
come
to
the
district
court
where
he
was
arraigned
and
make
identification,
i
think
this
would
have
been
proper
or
if
he
were
out
on
the
street
and
mrs.
behrendt
were
physically
able
to
do
so,
she
could
have
made
identification
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
out
on
the
street,
if
this
however
--
mr.
william
cahn
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
cahn
he
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
help?
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
he
helped
us
make
a
case
against
himself?
i
do
not
believe
that
this
comes
under
the
constitutional
concept
of
self-incrimination
by
his
mere
presence
there.
he
--
by
going
with
us
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
of
course
it
was
a
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes
and
it
also
provided
him
an
opportunity
to
be
completely
exonerated.
and
if
we
have
to
wait
until
mrs.
behrendt
was
physically
able
to
do
so,
then
she
would
have
been
brought
to
the
jail
or
brought
to
a
court
at
his
further
arraignment
and
the
same
thing
would
have
been
accomplished.
now,
insofar
as
the
results
of
this
prior
identification
is
concerned
--
what
took
place,
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
they
made
him
say
certain
words.
they
asked
him
to
say
certain
words.
mr.
william
cahn
yes
sir.
i
believe
he
could
have.
i
believe
the
schmerber
case
stands
for
that
and
i
believe
a
line
of
new
york
state
cases
stands
for
that.
we've
had
incidents
where
they
were
asked
to
put
on
certain
clothing,
where
they're
asked
to
even
shave
or
to
--
if
he
had
a
scar
on
his
chest
and
that
was
the
subject
of
an
identity
by
a
witness,
i
think
he
could
have
been
asked
to
remove
his
shirt
in
court
with
whether
the
counsel
objected
or
not
and
--
so
that
the,
let's
say
a
scar
or
a
tattoo
could
have
been
identified
by
the
witness.
if
he
had
--
if
it
was
noticed
that
he
had
11
toes,
i
think
he
could
have
been
asked
to
take
off
his
shoe
in
court
whether
counsel
objected
or
not.
i
think
the
line
of
cases
so
hold
and
i
think
that
concept
of
law
is
reiterated
in
the
schmerber
case.
mr.
william
cahn
as
far
as
the
words
are
concerned
at
no
time
where
any
of
these
words
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury,
it
was
clear
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear
and
the
counsel
mentioned
that
these
words
were
stated
purely
for
the
identification
of
the
voice
and
in
no
way
was
the
defendant
interrogated.
mr.
william
cahn
may
i
suggest
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it's
the
words
he
were
forced
to
say
were,
i
committed
the
crime
and
this
method
was
brought
before
the
attention
of
the
jury,
to
what
benefit
or
to
what
detriment
would
it
have
been
to
the
defendant
and
those
were
not
the
words
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
can't
argue
with
the
--
justice
fortas,
on
that.
there
--
that
there
might
have
been
a
natural
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
tendency
to
so.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
cahn
well
--
mr.
william
cahn
as
i
--
yes,
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
mr.
william
cahn
the
testimonial
compulsion
i
believe
that
is
set
out
in
the
schmerber
case
relates
to
--
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
there
are
no
questions
--
mr.
william
cahn
there
is
no
question
that
if
this
defendant
were
interrogated
rather
than
merely
to
ask
to
say
words,
there
might
have
been
a
very
definite
violation.
but
this
was
not
the
case,
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
record
that
this
defendant
was
interrogated
or
asked
about
the
crime
and
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
there
was
no
confession
here,
none
whatsoever.
insofar
as
due
process
is
concerned,
the
method
of
identification
in
no
way
shocks
the
conscience
of
mankind
or
falls
below
the
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
as
i
pointed
out
to
this
illustrious
body
before,
each
and
every
time
whether
an
attorney
is
present
or
not
a
witness
who
knows
where
the
defendant
sits
who
perhaps
sometimes
in
court
is
shackled
and
who
sees
him
go
and
come
at
recesses
perhaps
handcuffed
to
the
marshals
of
the
court,
sits
down
and
says,
yes,
there
is
the
man
this
same
process
is
done
each
and
every
time.
and
this
too,
in
no
way
violates
the
conscience
of
mankind
or
falls
below
the
standards
of
due
process
as
set
out
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
testimony
is
indeed
extremely
important.
viewing
the
defendant
alone
very,
very
often
happens
as
a
matter
of
fact,
very
often
becomes
the
subject
of
probable
cause
of
arrest,
if
a
person
is
robbed
and
10
minutes
later,
sees
a
police
officer,
and
complainants
of
the
robbery,
walks
down
the
street
and
says,
there
is
the
man
who
is
walking
alone,
this
is
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
--
mr.
william
cahn
no
question
in
my
mind,
your
honor,
there
would
have
been
a
case
but
may
i
repeat
that
the
first
testimonial
inference
of
this
prior
identification
came
as
a
result
of
cross-examination
by
defense
counsel
of
the
people's
witness.
the
only
time
it
was
mentioned
first
was
in
the
opening
of
the
assistant
district
attorney.
further,
the
prior
identification
became
the
basis
of
attack
for
mrs.
behrendt's
identification
in
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
foundation
was
laid
by
the
defendant
himself
and
he
almost
rested
his
case
on
indicating
that
her
identification
in
court
was
as
the
result
of
this
prior
identification
over
a
year
ago
in
the
hospital
room.
mr.
william
cahn
to
properly
care
for
the
safety
and
health
of
the
defendant.
i
don't
think
he
has
--
that
to
see
that
he's
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
properly
fit
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
see
no
constitutional
--
mr.
william
cahn
--
question
--
mr.
william
cahn
well
it
may
if
--
may
i
explain
something
mr.
justice
black
that
in
nassau
county
where
the
judge
places
the
defendant
in
custody
of
the
sheriff,
it
is
the
police
who
take
the
defendant
to
the
jail
and
place
him
into
the
custody
of
a
sheriff.
there
was
no
--
he
didn't
go
to
the
jail
first.
there
was
a
stop
off
at
the
hospital.
mr.
william
cahn
that's
correct.
mr.
william
cahn
to
do
nothing
to
him
--
mr.
william
cahn
that
would
harm
him.
that
is
correct
sir.
and
in
--
mr.
william
cahn
i
certainly
agree
with
mr.
justice
black,
yes
sir.
it
is
a
very
good
policy
and
i
state
that,
in
no
way
that
this
identification
harmed
the
defendant
because
it
just
delayed
his
identification
and
in
fact
--
mr.
william
cahn
yes,
it
did
in
this
particular
instance
but
may
i
point
out
to
mr.
justice
black
that
it
could
also
had
resulted
in
his
complete
exoneration.
mr.
william
cahn
well,
it
can
be
done
sir.
i
see
no
restriction
against
it
and
may
i
point
this
out
--
mr.
william
cahn
oh,
where?
in
a
civilized
state
mr.
justice
black
and
there
are
certain
limitations
which
are
placed
upon
sheriffs,
law
enforcement
officers
or
custodians
of
prisoners.
there
are
certain
limitations
which
must
have
necessity,
be
adhered
to
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
cahn
no
sir,
not
in
those
very
terms.
but
in
this
case
may
i
point
out
that
it
would
have
just
delayed
it,
it
would
have
meant
mrs.
behrendt
getting
physically
well
enough
to
come
over
to
the
jail
and
view
the
body.
the
viewing
itself
is
the
essence
and
the
pit
of
this
particular
question
and
i
think
no
harm
whatsoever
was
done
to
the
prisoner
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
just
a
stop
off
before
going
to
jail.
thank
you.
