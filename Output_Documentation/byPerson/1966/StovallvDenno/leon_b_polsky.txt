mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
briefly
to
go
over
the
relevant
facts
as
it
relates
to
the
questions
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
the
two
proceedings
cases
highlighting
those
factual
matters
in
which
the
three
cases
that
you
have
on
this
general
lineup
question
to
some
extent
differ,
it
may
involve
different
rules
of
law.
essentially
what
happened
here
was
that
a
homicide
took
place
in
the
early
morning
of
--
in
a
rural
community
--
urban
community,
new
york
state.
the
next
day,
stovall
was
taken
into
custody,
went
through
a
lengthy
interrogation
throughout
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
and
the
following
morning
was
arraigned
upon
a
complaint
charging
a
capital
offense.
after
that
arraignment
at
which
he
was
not
offered
--
assigned
counsel,
after
that
arraignment,
he
was
then
taken
back
to
the
police
station
where
probably
nothing
much
transpired
and
then
to
the
hospital
room
where
the
wife
of
the
victim
was
then
under
treatment.
in
that
hospital
room,
the
wife
of
the
victim
who
became
the
identifying
witness
at
the
trial
was
with
three
white
police
officers
and
two
white
assistant
district
attorneys.
stovall,
a
negro,
was
brought
in
handcuffs,
handcuffed
to
other
white
officers
into
the
room.
in
the
room
he
was
asked,
quote,
to
say
these
words,
we
do
not
know
what
those
words
were
for
voice
identification.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
well,
he
was
told
to
say
something
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
we
don't
know
what
it
was.
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
at
the
trial
were
--
that
he
was
told
to
say
certain
words
and
that
was
it.
we
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
this
was
in
nassau
county,
in
hempstead
i
believe.
the
wife
of
the
victim
identified
stovall
at
that
time
as
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
as
the
man
who
killed
her
husband
and
who
stabbed
her.
approximately
a
year
later,
when
the
case
came
to
trial,
the
district
attorney
in
his
opening
stated
that
mrs.
behrendt
would
testify
that
two
days
after
the
crime
she
identified
stovall.
and
the
prosecutor
then
said
he
did
not
know
whether
mrs.
behrendt
would
be
able
to
identify
the
petitioner
in
court.
mrs.
behrendt
then
later
did
in
fact
identify
stovall
in
court
and
she
did
in
fact
testify
that
she
had
previously
identified
the
petitioner
in
her
hospital
room.
now
under
new
york
law,
this
evidence
of
prior
identification
if
she
had
only
been
able
to
say,
"he
is
the
man
i
identified
a
year
ago",
and
if
there
were
no
other
evidence
in
the
case
except
for
corpus
delicti,
that
would
be
sufficient
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt
to
sustain
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
to
sustain
a
motion
--
to
sustain
the
prima
facie
case
of
the
people.
in
other
words
this
prior
identification
alone
is
affirmative
evidence
both
of
guilt
and
to
corroborate
the
in
court
identification
which
mrs.
behrendt
made
at
the
trial.
now,
our
claim
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
no,
i
--
it's
not
that
the
corroboration
is
necessary.
it
is
bolstering
testimony
but
it
also
is
independent,
it
has
independent
evidentiary
value
so
that
if
she
did
not,
if
she
was
not
able
to
identify
him
at
trial,
this
prior
identification
is
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well
actually,
in
new
york
it
is
rather
peculiar
because
until
1927,
the
new
york
courts
excluded
all
evidence
of
prior
identification
by
the
statute
393
(b)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
evidence
of
prior
identification
by
the
witness
who
was
testifying
may
be
admitted
if
identity
is
an
issue.
so
without
the
statute,
new
york
would
adhere
to
the
common
law
rule
that
evidence
of
prior
identification
is
inadmissible.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
evidence
came
out
in
this
fashion.
first,
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
stated
that
mrs.
behrendt
would
testify
that
she
identified
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
that's
the
man.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
--
mrs.
behrendt
testified
to
it.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
prior
to
the
testimony
of
mrs.
behrendt,
several
police
officers
who
had
been
present
in
the
hospital
room
at
the
time
of
the
identification
were
on
cross-examination
interrogated
by
the
defense
counsel
as
to
the
manner
of
identification,
as
to
the
suggested
condition.
was
he
the
only
negro
in
the
room?
was
he
in
handcuffs?
had
mrs.
behrendt
been
told
that
the
suspect
was
going
to
be
brought
in?
and
in
other
words,
the
defense
counsel,
as
we
argue
was
laying
the
foundation
for
the
impeachment
of
mrs.
behrendt's
promised
testimony
because
she
did
in
fact
later
testified
that
stovall
had
been
brought
into
her
room
or
rather
she
had
been
moved
to
another
room
and
then
stovall
was
brought
in
and
she
there
said,"he
is
the
man".
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
she
is
the
only
one
who
directly
gave
it.
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
cross-examination
of
the
officers
who
were
present
that
an
identification
had
in
fact
been
made.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
think
the
questions
were
framed
differently.
i
cannot
give
you
chapter
and
verse
on
this.
i
think
the
questions
essentially
were
framed.
were
you
there
when
mrs.
behrendt
identified
the
petitioner?
and,
what
were
the
conditions
existing
in
the
room
at
the
time
that
mrs.
behrendt
identified
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
this
came
before
her
test
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
right.
now,
essentially
our
argument
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
under
the
hamilton
and
white
cases,
i
think
is
designed
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
those
cases.
essentially,
we
have
all
that
was
present
in
both
of
those
cases,
defendant
arraigned
upon
a
capital
charge.
a
defendant
then
entitled
to
counsel
who
didn't
waive
it
and
who
didn't
get
counsel.
and
that
thereafter
and
we
suggest
because
of
the
absence
of
counsel
something
happened
by
which
the
state
may
have
gained
an
advantage
in
the
ultimate
prosecution
of
the
case.
now
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
hamilton
against
alabama.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
white
against
maryland.
now
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
i
regard
my
duty
as
an
attorney
to
protect
every
right
that
my
client
has
and
to
prepare
his
case
as
best
as
i
can.
this
does
no
restrict
me
to
the
courtroom.
this
does
not
restrict
me
to
only
raising
constitutional
questions.
if
counsel
had
been
assigned
here
and
quite
frankly
if
it
--
if
i
had
been
the
counsel
assigned
here
i
would
have
pleaded
with
the
district
attorney
to
hold
the
lineup.
even
if
he
would
--
hadn't
intended
to
bring
stovall
to
mrs.
behrendt's
room,
if
she
was
in
danger
of
death
and
if
she
was
as
the
majority
of
the
circuit
held
the
only
person
who
could
exonerate
him,
i
would
have
wanted
stovall
to
be
brought
to
her
room.
but
i
also
would
have
asked
the
prosecutor
to
do
it
in
a
fair
way,
so
that
the
man
has
a
chance
because
coming
back
to
393
(b)
of
the
new
york
statute,
under
new
york
law,
what
happens
in
that
hospital
room
is
evidence.
this
is
not
an
interview
with
the
witness
where
subsequently
the
witness
testifies
and
doesn't
recount
what
he
told
the
district
attorney
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
this
is
something
which
is
actual,
real
evidence
which
is
occurring
at
the
time.
and
it
is
at
this
time
that
this
man
is
going
to
be
convicted
or
acquitted.
and
i
as
his
counsel
believed
that
i
am
entitled
to
be
there.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
all
we
have
asked
for
in
the
circuit
was
that
this
evidence
of
prior
identification
be
excluded.
we
did
not
ask
that
the
present
identification
be
excluded,
leaving
to
us
the
option
as
judge
friendly
in
his
panel
decision
and
later
in
his
en
banc
dissent
leaving
the
defense
counsel
the
option
of
using
the
prior
identification
for
whatever
impeaching
effect
it
might
have.
this
is
one
possible
solution.
the
other
solution
--
which
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
perhaps
is
more
realistic.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
it
depends
how
damaging
the
in
court
identification
would
be.
but
i
think
the
most
realistic
solution
and
it
is
not
easy.
is
to
have
a
voir
dire
either
pretrial
or
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
or
whatever
stage
is
most
convenient.
essentially
the
kind
of
voir
dire
or
you
would
have
on
a
motion
to
suppress
where
the
government
has
conceded
that
search
number
one
was
illegal
but
claims
that
search
number
two
was
legal
and
where
defense
counsel
says
that
search
number
two
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisoned
for
a
search.
in
other
words
you
have
this
problem
of
taint.
does
the
first
illegal
act
taint
the
second
or
is
the
second
act
sufficiently
independent
of
the
first
to
be
allowed
to
stand.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
the
right
to
ask
for
a
complete
attainder
of
a
witness
just
because
a
prosecutor
made
a
mistake.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
mistake
hurts
the
defendant's
case,
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask
that
his
testimony
be
excluded.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
don't
follow
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
because
under
the
silverthorne
line
of
cases,
the
government
has
the
burden
like
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
prove
it.
mrs.
behrendt
saw
this
man
for
less
than
five
seconds
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
after
she
was
struck
down,
stovall
remained
in
the
room
but
mrs.
behrendt
said
that
she
did
not
see
him.
he
was
brought
into
the
room
under
--
i
think
pretty,
spotlight
conditions.
i
think
a
judge
would
be
entitled
to
say
that
the
people
have
not
proven
to
his
satisfaction
of
her
identification
is
independent.
but,
i
grant
you
it
is
a
difficult
problem,
but
i
think
we're
entitled
to
trial.
essentially
my
point
here
though
is
that
the
prior
identification
is
not
affirmatively
admissible,
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
and
that
prior
identification
was
used
--
it
was
used
in
a
capital
case.
there
is
no
way
we
can
ever
juggle
the
record
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
determine
how
damaging
this
was
or
was
not.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
this
aspect
is
based
on
the
sixth.
although
quite
frankly,
there
has
to
be
a
--
not
a
collision,
an
overlapping
here
because
there
are
factors
which
aggravates
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
takes
care
of
the
sixth
amendment
point.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
i
also
go
beyond
that
--
i
mean,
supplying
him
a
counsel
would
have
--
would
take
care
of
my
problem
here
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
except
for
the
extent
that
the
lineup
was
not
fair,
i
would
still
even
if
he
had
counsel
have
a
point
involving
the
fundamental
fairness
of
showing
a
man
alone
to
a
victim
under
these
particular
circumstances
where
her
testimony
or
rather
where
her
identification
then
becomes
affirmative
evidence
to
be
used
at
trial.
i
would
still
have
that,
whether
he
had
counsel
or
not.
and
i
realized
the
problems
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument,
it's
essentially
how
fair
is
fair
and
how
unfair
is
unfair.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
if
this
identification,
the
pretrial
identification
had
been
so
unfair,
as
we
contend
it
was,
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
i
say
that
the
evidence
of
prior
identification
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury.
and
while
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
and
here
is
perhaps
where
i
--
where
there's
this
overlapping
of
amendments.
in
the
earlier
--
well,
the
absence
of
counsel
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
the
fairness
of
this
lineup.
and
you
also
have
the
problem
of
reporting
the
lineup.
i
do
not
know
what
was
said
by
stovall.
i
doubt
whether
anybody
else
really
does
know
at
this
point.
had
he
had
counsel
there?
perhaps
we
would
know
what
those
words
were
that
he
was
made
to
say.
and
it's
not
enough
to
rely
upon
the
petitioner
to
tell
his
lawyer,
a,
because
the
petitioner
very
well
may
not
remember,
and
b,
the
petitioner
or
defendants
in
most
criminal
cases
cannot
testify
because
of
prior
convictions.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
identification
was
used
in
this
way,
in
the
prosecutors
opening
addressed
to
the
jury,
he
informed
the
jury
that
this
woman
would
testify
that
one
year
previously
she
had
identified
stovall
in
her
hospital
room.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
then
they
did
do
that.
now,
there
has
been
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
we
did
not
do
it
except
that
prior
to
her
testimony,
defense
counsel
cross-examined
those
officers
who
were
testifying
as
part
of
the
case
in
chief.
on
the
question
of
what
happened
in
the
hospital
room,
they
questioned
one
of
the
officers
how
many
--
was
there
another
negro
in
the
room,
was
the
defendant
in
handcuffs,
questions
designed
to
lay
the
foundation
for
the
impeachment
of
this
promised
testimony
to
be
given
by
the
wife
of
the
victim.
now,
in
the
circuit
i
think
we
had
complete
agreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
judges
on
the
question
of
--
that
this
was
not
an
invited
error
by
the
defense
counsel
and
that
the
question
has
been
preserved
for
federal
reviews.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
it
was
shown
that
he
was
taken
in
handcuffs
and
told
to
say
these
words.
i
think
it
is
shown
that
he
was
taken
contrary
to
law
earlier
in
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
identification.
he
had
been
arraigned
and
had
been
committed
pending
further
exam
--
further
arraignment
proceedings
by
the
committee
magistrate.
that
commitment
under
state
law
is
to
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
who
is
the
man
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
in
charge
of
the
jail.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
instead
of
being
taken
to
the
sheriff
and
put
in
jail,
he
was
taken
from
the
courtroom
by
police
officers,
the
ones
who
had
been
investigating
the
case
back
to
police
station
where
perhaps
they
just
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
over
to
the
hospital
room.
so
it
was
in
violation
of
the
state
law.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
there
was
no
showing
that
stovall
protested.
stovall
did
not
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
first
i
would
like
to
answer
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
black
concerning
the
powers
of
a
sheriff
in
new
york.
under
section
500
(c)
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure,
a
sheriff
shall
not
without
lawful
authority
let
any
such
person
committed
person
out
of
jail
which
i
think
precludes
any
release
of
a
prisoner
without
a
court
order.
addressing
myself
to
the
argument
that
has
been
made
both
here
and
in
the
proceeding
cases,
that
this
was
just
a
prosecutor's
preparation
of
a
case
and
that
it's
analogous
to
interview
with
witnesses,
i
think
there
we
come
very
close
to
the
nub
of
what's
involved
here.
here,
the
situation
would
be
analogous
to
the
interview
with
witnesses
if
a
district
attorney
when
interviewing
a
witness
would
then
prepare
a
statement
for
the
witness
which
the
witness
then
would
sign,
and
then
that
statement
itself
would
be
put
in
evidence
at
trial
as
affirmative
proof
of
what
the
witness
had
to
say.
in
other
words,
the
pretrial
interview
via
prosecutor,
what
transpires
at
that
interview
is
not
evidence
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
but
even
if
the
witness
at
the
trial
in
the
interview
situation
took
the
trial
under
oath
testified.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
on
direct
examination.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
would
say
no.
i
was
--
i
know
of
no
rule
of
evidence
which
would
permit
a
prior
consistent
statement
by
a
witness
given
out
of
court
to
the
attorney
preparing
the
case
would
be
admitted
in
evidence
as
part
of
the
direct
case.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
i
don't
agree
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
i
do
not
agree.
a
case
is
won
or
lost
out
of
court.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
just
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
correct.
as
the
district
attorney
has
said
here,
this
identification
by
mrs.
behrendt
in
the
hospital
room
was
critical.
it
was
the
thing
that
the
court
have
--
had
exonerated
him.
i
would
like
to
be
there
when
my
client
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
is
being
exonerated.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
well
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
the
premise
is
the
right
of
counsel
in
court
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
counsel
out
of
court.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
and
we
say
it
extends
to
this
situation.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
we
contend
that
if
these
cases
ought
to
have
any
meaning,
of
hamilton
and
white,
even
if
limited
only
to
a
capital
situation,
if
they
are
to
have
any
prophylactic
meaning,
if
they
are
to
get
a
man,
a
lawyer
as
soon
as
he
--
as
a
court
can
get
him
one
then
the
state
must
act
at
their
peril
in
any
way
that
they
tried
to
obtain
evidence
thereafter.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
briefly
to
go
over
the
relevant
facts
as
it
relates
to
the
questions
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
the
two
proceedings
cases
highlighting
those
factual
matters
in
which
the
three
cases
that
you
have
on
this
general
lineup
question
to
some
extent
differ,
it
may
involve
different
rules
of
law.
essentially
what
happened
here
was
that
a
homicide
took
place
in
the
early
morning
of
--
in
a
rural
community
--
urban
community,
new
york
state.
the
next
day,
stovall
was
taken
into
custody,
went
through
a
lengthy
interrogation
throughout
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
and
the
following
morning
was
arraigned
upon
a
complaint
charging
a
capital
offense.
after
that
arraignment
at
which
he
was
not
offered
--
assigned
counsel,
after
that
arraignment,
he
was
then
taken
back
to
the
police
station
where
probably
nothing
much
transpired
and
then
to
the
hospital
room
where
the
wife
of
the
victim
was
then
under
treatment.
in
that
hospital
room,
the
wife
of
the
victim
who
became
the
identifying
witness
at
the
trial
was
with
three
white
police
officers
and
two
white
assistant
district
attorneys.
stovall,
a
negro,
was
brought
in
handcuffs,
handcuffed
to
other
white
officers
into
the
room.
in
the
room
he
was
asked,
quote,
to
say
these
words,
we
do
not
know
what
those
words
were
for
voice
identification.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
well,
he
was
told
to
say
something
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
we
don't
know
what
it
was.
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
at
the
trial
were
--
that
he
was
told
to
say
certain
words
and
that
was
it.
we
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
this
was
in
nassau
county,
in
hempstead
i
believe.
the
wife
of
the
victim
identified
stovall
at
that
time
as
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
as
the
man
who
killed
her
husband
and
who
stabbed
her.
approximately
a
year
later,
when
the
case
came
to
trial,
the
district
attorney
in
his
opening
stated
that
mrs.
behrendt
would
testify
that
two
days
after
the
crime
she
identified
stovall.
and
the
prosecutor
then
said
he
did
not
know
whether
mrs.
behrendt
would
be
able
to
identify
the
petitioner
in
court.
mrs.
behrendt
then
later
did
in
fact
identify
stovall
in
court
and
she
did
in
fact
testify
that
she
had
previously
identified
the
petitioner
in
her
hospital
room.
now
under
new
york
law,
this
evidence
of
prior
identification
if
she
had
only
been
able
to
say,
"he
is
the
man
i
identified
a
year
ago",
and
if
there
were
no
other
evidence
in
the
case
except
for
corpus
delicti,
that
would
be
sufficient
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt
to
sustain
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
to
sustain
a
motion
--
to
sustain
the
prima
facie
case
of
the
people.
in
other
words
this
prior
identification
alone
is
affirmative
evidence
both
of
guilt
and
to
corroborate
the
in
court
identification
which
mrs.
behrendt
made
at
the
trial.
now,
our
claim
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
no,
i
--
it's
not
that
the
corroboration
is
necessary.
it
is
bolstering
testimony
but
it
also
is
independent,
it
has
independent
evidentiary
value
so
that
if
she
did
not,
if
she
was
not
able
to
identify
him
at
trial,
this
prior
identification
is
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well
actually,
in
new
york
it
is
rather
peculiar
because
until
1927,
the
new
york
courts
excluded
all
evidence
of
prior
identification
by
the
statute
393
(b)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
evidence
of
prior
identification
by
the
witness
who
was
testifying
may
be
admitted
if
identity
is
an
issue.
so
without
the
statute,
new
york
would
adhere
to
the
common
law
rule
that
evidence
of
prior
identification
is
inadmissible.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
evidence
came
out
in
this
fashion.
first,
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
stated
that
mrs.
behrendt
would
testify
that
she
identified
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
that's
the
man.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
--
mrs.
behrendt
testified
to
it.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
prior
to
the
testimony
of
mrs.
behrendt,
several
police
officers
who
had
been
present
in
the
hospital
room
at
the
time
of
the
identification
were
on
cross-examination
interrogated
by
the
defense
counsel
as
to
the
manner
of
identification,
as
to
the
suggested
condition.
was
he
the
only
negro
in
the
room?
was
he
in
handcuffs?
had
mrs.
behrendt
been
told
that
the
suspect
was
going
to
be
brought
in?
and
in
other
words,
the
defense
counsel,
as
we
argue
was
laying
the
foundation
for
the
impeachment
of
mrs.
behrendt's
promised
testimony
because
she
did
in
fact
later
testified
that
stovall
had
been
brought
into
her
room
or
rather
she
had
been
moved
to
another
room
and
then
stovall
was
brought
in
and
she
there
said,"he
is
the
man".
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
she
is
the
only
one
who
directly
gave
it.
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
cross-examination
of
the
officers
who
were
present
that
an
identification
had
in
fact
been
made.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
think
the
questions
were
framed
differently.
i
cannot
give
you
chapter
and
verse
on
this.
i
think
the
questions
essentially
were
framed.
were
you
there
when
mrs.
behrendt
identified
the
petitioner?
and,
what
were
the
conditions
existing
in
the
room
at
the
time
that
mrs.
behrendt
identified
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
this
came
before
her
test
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
right.
now,
essentially
our
argument
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
under
the
hamilton
and
white
cases,
i
think
is
designed
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
those
cases.
essentially,
we
have
all
that
was
present
in
both
of
those
cases,
defendant
arraigned
upon
a
capital
charge.
a
defendant
then
entitled
to
counsel
who
didn't
waive
it
and
who
didn't
get
counsel.
and
that
thereafter
and
we
suggest
because
of
the
absence
of
counsel
something
happened
by
which
the
state
may
have
gained
an
advantage
in
the
ultimate
prosecution
of
the
case.
now
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
hamilton
against
alabama.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
white
against
maryland.
now
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
i
regard
my
duty
as
an
attorney
to
protect
every
right
that
my
client
has
and
to
prepare
his
case
as
best
as
i
can.
this
does
no
restrict
me
to
the
courtroom.
this
does
not
restrict
me
to
only
raising
constitutional
questions.
if
counsel
had
been
assigned
here
and
quite
frankly
if
it
--
if
i
had
been
the
counsel
assigned
here
i
would
have
pleaded
with
the
district
attorney
to
hold
the
lineup.
even
if
he
would
--
hadn't
intended
to
bring
stovall
to
mrs.
behrendt's
room,
if
she
was
in
danger
of
death
and
if
she
was
as
the
majority
of
the
circuit
held
the
only
person
who
could
exonerate
him,
i
would
have
wanted
stovall
to
be
brought
to
her
room.
but
i
also
would
have
asked
the
prosecutor
to
do
it
in
a
fair
way,
so
that
the
man
has
a
chance
because
coming
back
to
393
(b)
of
the
new
york
statute,
under
new
york
law,
what
happens
in
that
hospital
room
is
evidence.
this
is
not
an
interview
with
the
witness
where
subsequently
the
witness
testifies
and
doesn't
recount
what
he
told
the
district
attorney
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
this
is
something
which
is
actual,
real
evidence
which
is
occurring
at
the
time.
and
it
is
at
this
time
that
this
man
is
going
to
be
convicted
or
acquitted.
and
i
as
his
counsel
believed
that
i
am
entitled
to
be
there.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
all
we
have
asked
for
in
the
circuit
was
that
this
evidence
of
prior
identification
be
excluded.
we
did
not
ask
that
the
present
identification
be
excluded,
leaving
to
us
the
option
as
judge
friendly
in
his
panel
decision
and
later
in
his
en
banc
dissent
leaving
the
defense
counsel
the
option
of
using
the
prior
identification
for
whatever
impeaching
effect
it
might
have.
this
is
one
possible
solution.
the
other
solution
--
which
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
perhaps
is
more
realistic.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
it
depends
how
damaging
the
in
court
identification
would
be.
but
i
think
the
most
realistic
solution
and
it
is
not
easy.
is
to
have
a
voir
dire
either
pretrial
or
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
or
whatever
stage
is
most
convenient.
essentially
the
kind
of
voir
dire
or
you
would
have
on
a
motion
to
suppress
where
the
government
has
conceded
that
search
number
one
was
illegal
but
claims
that
search
number
two
was
legal
and
where
defense
counsel
says
that
search
number
two
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisoned
for
a
search.
in
other
words
you
have
this
problem
of
taint.
does
the
first
illegal
act
taint
the
second
or
is
the
second
act
sufficiently
independent
of
the
first
to
be
allowed
to
stand.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
the
right
to
ask
for
a
complete
attainder
of
a
witness
just
because
a
prosecutor
made
a
mistake.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
mistake
hurts
the
defendant's
case,
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask
that
his
testimony
be
excluded.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
don't
follow
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
because
under
the
silverthorne
line
of
cases,
the
government
has
the
burden
like
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
prove
it.
mrs.
behrendt
saw
this
man
for
less
than
five
seconds
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
after
she
was
struck
down,
stovall
remained
in
the
room
but
mrs.
behrendt
said
that
she
did
not
see
him.
he
was
brought
into
the
room
under
--
i
think
pretty,
spotlight
conditions.
i
think
a
judge
would
be
entitled
to
say
that
the
people
have
not
proven
to
his
satisfaction
of
her
identification
is
independent.
but,
i
grant
you
it
is
a
difficult
problem,
but
i
think
we're
entitled
to
trial.
essentially
my
point
here
though
is
that
the
prior
identification
is
not
affirmatively
admissible,
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
and
that
prior
identification
was
used
--
it
was
used
in
a
capital
case.
there
is
no
way
we
can
ever
juggle
the
record
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
determine
how
damaging
this
was
or
was
not.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
this
aspect
is
based
on
the
sixth.
although
quite
frankly,
there
has
to
be
a
--
not
a
collision,
an
overlapping
here
because
there
are
factors
which
aggravates
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
takes
care
of
the
sixth
amendment
point.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
i
also
go
beyond
that
--
i
mean,
supplying
him
a
counsel
would
have
--
would
take
care
of
my
problem
here
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
except
for
the
extent
that
the
lineup
was
not
fair,
i
would
still
even
if
he
had
counsel
have
a
point
involving
the
fundamental
fairness
of
showing
a
man
alone
to
a
victim
under
these
particular
circumstances
where
her
testimony
or
rather
where
her
identification
then
becomes
affirmative
evidence
to
be
used
at
trial.
i
would
still
have
that,
whether
he
had
counsel
or
not.
and
i
realized
the
problems
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument,
it's
essentially
how
fair
is
fair
and
how
unfair
is
unfair.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
if
this
identification,
the
pretrial
identification
had
been
so
unfair,
as
we
contend
it
was,
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
i
say
that
the
evidence
of
prior
identification
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury.
and
while
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
and
here
is
perhaps
where
i
--
where
there's
this
overlapping
of
amendments.
in
the
earlier
--
well,
the
absence
of
counsel
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
the
fairness
of
this
lineup.
and
you
also
have
the
problem
of
reporting
the
lineup.
i
do
not
know
what
was
said
by
stovall.
i
doubt
whether
anybody
else
really
does
know
at
this
point.
had
he
had
counsel
there?
perhaps
we
would
know
what
those
words
were
that
he
was
made
to
say.
and
it's
not
enough
to
rely
upon
the
petitioner
to
tell
his
lawyer,
a,
because
the
petitioner
very
well
may
not
remember,
and
b,
the
petitioner
or
defendants
in
most
criminal
cases
cannot
testify
because
of
prior
convictions.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
identification
was
used
in
this
way,
in
the
prosecutors
opening
addressed
to
the
jury,
he
informed
the
jury
that
this
woman
would
testify
that
one
year
previously
she
had
identified
stovall
in
her
hospital
room.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
then
they
did
do
that.
now,
there
has
been
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
we
did
not
do
it
except
that
prior
to
her
testimony,
defense
counsel
cross-examined
those
officers
who
were
testifying
as
part
of
the
case
in
chief.
on
the
question
of
what
happened
in
the
hospital
room,
they
questioned
one
of
the
officers
how
many
--
was
there
another
negro
in
the
room,
was
the
defendant
in
handcuffs,
questions
designed
to
lay
the
foundation
for
the
impeachment
of
this
promised
testimony
to
be
given
by
the
wife
of
the
victim.
now,
in
the
circuit
i
think
we
had
complete
agreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
judges
on
the
question
of
--
that
this
was
not
an
invited
error
by
the
defense
counsel
and
that
the
question
has
been
preserved
for
federal
reviews.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
it
was
shown
that
he
was
taken
in
handcuffs
and
told
to
say
these
words.
i
think
it
is
shown
that
he
was
taken
contrary
to
law
earlier
in
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
identification.
he
had
been
arraigned
and
had
been
committed
pending
further
exam
--
further
arraignment
proceedings
by
the
committee
magistrate.
that
commitment
under
state
law
is
to
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
who
is
the
man
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
in
charge
of
the
jail.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
instead
of
being
taken
to
the
sheriff
and
put
in
jail,
he
was
taken
from
the
courtroom
by
police
officers,
the
ones
who
had
been
investigating
the
case
back
to
police
station
where
perhaps
they
just
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
over
to
the
hospital
room.
so
it
was
in
violation
of
the
state
law.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
there
was
no
showing
that
stovall
protested.
stovall
did
not
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
first
i
would
like
to
answer
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
black
concerning
the
powers
of
a
sheriff
in
new
york.
under
section
500
(c)
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure,
a
sheriff
shall
not
without
lawful
authority
let
any
such
person
committed
person
out
of
jail
which
i
think
precludes
any
release
of
a
prisoner
without
a
court
order.
addressing
myself
to
the
argument
that
has
been
made
both
here
and
in
the
proceeding
cases,
that
this
was
just
a
prosecutor's
preparation
of
a
case
and
that
it's
analogous
to
interview
with
witnesses,
i
think
there
we
come
very
close
to
the
nub
of
what's
involved
here.
here,
the
situation
would
be
analogous
to
the
interview
with
witnesses
if
a
district
attorney
when
interviewing
a
witness
would
then
prepare
a
statement
for
the
witness
which
the
witness
then
would
sign,
and
then
that
statement
itself
would
be
put
in
evidence
at
trial
as
affirmative
proof
of
what
the
witness
had
to
say.
in
other
words,
the
pretrial
interview
via
prosecutor,
what
transpires
at
that
interview
is
not
evidence
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
but
even
if
the
witness
at
the
trial
in
the
interview
situation
took
the
trial
under
oath
testified.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
on
direct
examination.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
would
say
no.
i
was
--
i
know
of
no
rule
of
evidence
which
would
permit
a
prior
consistent
statement
by
a
witness
given
out
of
court
to
the
attorney
preparing
the
case
would
be
admitted
in
evidence
as
part
of
the
direct
case.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
i
don't
agree
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
i
do
not
agree.
a
case
is
won
or
lost
out
of
court.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
just
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
correct.
as
the
district
attorney
has
said
here,
this
identification
by
mrs.
behrendt
in
the
hospital
room
was
critical.
it
was
the
thing
that
the
court
have
--
had
exonerated
him.
i
would
like
to
be
there
when
my
client
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
is
being
exonerated.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
well
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
the
premise
is
the
right
of
counsel
in
court
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
counsel
out
of
court.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
and
we
say
it
extends
to
this
situation.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
we
contend
that
if
these
cases
ought
to
have
any
meaning,
of
hamilton
and
white,
even
if
limited
only
to
a
capital
situation,
if
they
are
to
have
any
prophylactic
meaning,
if
they
are
to
get
a
man,
a
lawyer
as
soon
as
he
--
as
a
court
can
get
him
one
then
the
state
must
act
at
their
peril
in
any
way
that
they
tried
to
obtain
evidence
thereafter.
thank
you,
sir.
