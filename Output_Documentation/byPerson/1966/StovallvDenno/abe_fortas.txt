justice
abe
fortas
well,
assume
they
accepted
that,
what
is
your
thought
as
to
the
proper
remedy
for
the
situation,
is
it
to
exclude
all
identification
by
mrs.
behrendt
or
is
it
to
say
that
the
evidence
as
to
the
--
just
confrontation
and
the
identification
at
the
time
of
the
confrontation
is
inadmissible?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
become
a
dangerous
thing
for
a
defense
counsel,
he
is,
wouldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean,
not
really
be
argued
about,
very
much
though,
is
that
right,
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mrs.
behrendt
saw
this
man
in
a
hospital
room.
she
subsequently
saw
him
in
court.
now,
you're
suggesting
that
you
have
a
voir
dire
to
ascertain
whether
the
identification
in
the
court
was
the
fruit
of
the
identification
on
the
hospital?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
quite
the
likelihood
of
getting
mrs.
behrendt
to
agree
to
that
as
so
slim
that
it
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
it's
worthwhile
or
it's
just
gains.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
basing
this
on
the
sixth
amendment
or
due
process?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
test
that
among
us,
suppose
the
police
had
--
suppose
stovall
had
had
a
counsel,
the
police
had
said.
alright.
lawyer
polsky
come
along,
so
you
went
to
the
--
and
then
would
you
have
to
go
along
when
you
go
along
to
the
hospital
room
with
stovall
be
handcuffed
to
the
officers
and
everything
would
be
done
there,
mrs.
behrendt
went
to
identify
stovall
as
she
apparently
did
it,
does
that
take
care
of
your
problem?
that
would
take
care
of
your
sixth
amendment
right
in
a
sense,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
that
take
care
of
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
take
care
of
your
point
here?
justice
abe
fortas
but
one
case,
a
lawyer
--
his
lawyer
is
present,
the
other
case,
he's
not.
and
that's
what
this
--
we're
talking
about,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
the
problem.
i
mean,
if
i
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
certain
as
you
now
sound,
i'd
be
a
happier
man.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
schmerber
made
a
distinction
between
the
man's
blood
and
the
man's
words.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
there's
a
difference
in
--
they
can
be
words
and
words
in
--
with
respect
to
identification
where
it
stated
that
would
suggest
an
identification
in
words
stated
that
ambrek
could
be
neutral.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
think,
i
think
--
i
think
if
a
man
were
brought
before
mrs.
behrendt
handcuffed
and
he
said
to
mrs.
behrendt,
i
committed
the
crime
that'd
be
a
sort
of
a
natural
tendency
on
her
part
to
say,
"well,
i
guess
you
did".
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
but
maybe
with
an
--
proximate
counsel
to
tell
the
defendant
not
to
do
something,
that
the
police
tell
him
to
do,
in
which
the
defendant
cannot
be
compelled
to
do.
that's
the
issue,
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
did
not
understand
that
from
your
previous
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
the
defendant
compelled
to
give
the
police
a
voice
test?
what
can
the
police
do
if
he
doesn't
--
they
say
now,
say
something
and
the
commoner
remains
mute,
now
what
can
the
police
do?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
it's
unanswerable.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
the
line
that
you
are
going,
it
is
a
very
narrow
line
and
perhaps
there
is
a
function
for
a
counsel
here,
which
is
to
tell
the
witness
not
to
give
the
police
a
voice
test
or
go
beyond
that
and
that
the
police
say
--
turned
to
stovall
here
and
had
said
to
him,
stovall,
to
say
mrs.
behrendt
or
whatever
the
name
is,
i
drop
(inaudible)
on
you,
do
you
refuse
to
say
it?
