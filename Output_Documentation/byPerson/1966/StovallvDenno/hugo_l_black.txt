justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
have
said
heretofore,
but
i
do
not
recover
your
evidence
stating
precisely
how
the
state
knew
the
pretrial
identification
in
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
that
was
tried
--
they
didn't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
that,
you
didn't
do
it.
they
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
present
facts
as
i
understand
your
--
the
issue,
involved
in
such
--
in
a
case
where
a
defendant
asked
and
subjected
to
identification
against
his
will,
without
his
lawyer,
that
the
consequence
of
it
is
that
evidence
of
that
circumstance
cannot
be
introduced
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
that
argument
is
a
little
strange
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
say
that
a
lawyer,
a
man
in
jail,
in
custody
unable
to
make
bonds,
but
he's
in
custody
of
the
officers
of
the
law,
that
a
lawyer
could
do
him
no
good
if
he
were
present
when
they
were
interrogating
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
do
they
take
him
out
for
any
purpose
whatever
outside
of
this
jail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
a
lawyer
could
do
him
no
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lawyer
could've
objected
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lawyer
could've
just
knowing
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
when
a
man
is
put
in
jail,
the
officers
of
the
law
have
a
right
which
he
has
no
chance
to
object
to
it,
to
take
him
anywhere
they
please,
to
have
all
investigations
made
in
the
absence
of
his
attorney,
and
have
him
there
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
you
object
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
lawyers
being
there
if
they
could
do
no
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
notify
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
notify
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
no
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
state
had
the
power
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
had
the
power
to
do
it
because
he
was
under
arrest.
suppose
he
had
been
out
on
bond
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
you
have
seized
him
on
the
street
and
taken
him
down
for
that
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
reason
for
being
able
to
do
it
was
that
he
was
under
arrest
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
awaiting
a
charge
of
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
was
--
he
would,
he
wouldn't
have
helped
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
help
if
he
just
--
if
she
just
happens
to
see
him
on
the
streets.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
help
you
do
this.
he
helped
you
by
going
with
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
helped
you
make
out
a
case
against
himself,
did
he
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
it
gives
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
it
gave
the
state
much
assistance
what
might
have
been
vital
to
his
conviction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
point
--
did
they
make
him
say
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
in
your
judgment
is
the
duty
of
a
sheriff
who
has
a
prisoner
in
custody
in
jail
under
his
care?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
law
gives
him
any
right
to
utilize
that
time
when
a
man
is
there,
merely
charged
with
a
crime,
take
him
out
of
jail,
utilized
him
for
his
purposes
and
kind
of
build
up
a
case
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
a
good
sound
policy
for
the
sheriff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
put
into
custody
of
the
sheriff
as
a
trustee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
keep
him
in
prison
under
guard,
but
to
do
nothing
to
him,
isn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
harm
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
very
good
policy,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
harmed
him
because
they
took
him
out
and
did
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there's
nothing
--
it's
not
the
duty
of
the
sheriff
to
take
him
out
of
jail
even
to
--
his
complete
examination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
prisoner
--
a
prisoner
has
--
is
absolute
at
the
mercy
of
his
jailer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
law
in
any
state
in
the
union
i
don't
know
of
any
law
in
interstate
and
union
which
exist
now
or
ever
has
existed
that
in
--
actually
empowers
the
sheriff
the
duty
to
take
a
prisoner,
take
him
out
in
order
to
help
build
up
a
case
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
what
seems
to
be
the
assumption
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
lawyer
is
limited
to
his
right
to
have
somebody
represent
him
in
the
actual
trial
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
proceedings
in
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
in
modern
trial
of
cases
there
are
few
lawyers
representing
any
client,
who
do
not
have
some
method
of
protecting
their
client
and
advising
them,
or
they
actually
get
on
the
trial,
into
the
courtroom,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
i
assume,
i
don't
--
maybe
i'm
wrong,
in
modern
trial
of
cases
there
are
far
more
things
that
a
lawyer
does
to
represent
his
client
merely
represent
his
interest
and
talked
to
him
and
advised
him
while
he
is
actually
in
the
court,
in
the
witness
chair
or
being
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
method
of
investigation
by
both
sides
is
carried
on
both
by
the
state
and
the
defendant
with
--
in
