justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
may
i
ask
if
one
of
your
position
is
then
that
this
having
been
an
illegal
arrest
not
on
probable
cause
at
the
time,
everything
after
that
is
moot
and
that
that
ground
alone
inadmissible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
third
confession
are
you
going
to
have
a
problem
of
attenuation
of
chain
of
events?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
definitely
after
the
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
motion
to
suppress
the
third
confession
was
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
in
that
proceeding
that
you
sought
to
have
produced
the
first
two
confessions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
clear
about
it.
on
your
motion
to
exclude
the
third
confession
when
was
that
argued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
trial
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
did
you
try
to
get
the
first
two
confessions
based
in
connection
with
that
motion
to
exclude
the
third
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
would
not
require
the
prosecution
to
turn
them
over
to
him
even
limited
to
his
examination
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pena
did
the
conviction
rest
on
anything
to
accept
these
confessions
or
this
third
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
in
other
words
was
there
independent
proof
not
secured
through
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
whether
they
had
any
other
evidence
besides
the
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
was
no
evidence
i
gather
as
to
the
actual
killing
for
which
he
was
charged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
for
his
own
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
proved
independently
of
his
statement
and
his
confession
that
was
his
belt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
evidence
except
his
own
statement
that
it
was
his
belt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
was
in
the
context
of
your
trying
to
get
the
court,
the
trial
judge
as
i
understood
to
look
at
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
were
saying
“look
i'm
not
asking
for
myself,
i
want
you
to
look
at
them.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
