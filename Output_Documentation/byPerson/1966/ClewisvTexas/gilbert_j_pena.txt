mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
here
we
have
a
case
before
us
which
the
facts
are
completely
in
a
state
of
chaos
and
are
conflicting.
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
himself
is
conflicting
on
several
portions
of
the
record,
but
we
--
our
position
is
two-fold.
one,
that
the
first
two
confessions
were
not
coerced
but
were
indeed
voluntary.
and
number
two,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
first
two
confessions
were
involuntary
then
certainly
the
third
confession
was
by
his
own
admission
voluntary
and
that
under
some
of
the
holdings
of
this
court
so
much
time
had
transpired
from
the
first
two
confessions
and
he
had
been
removed
away
from
the
coercive
atmosphere
which
they
alleged
existed
that
the
third
confession
was
so
far
removed
from
the
other
two
that
if
there
was
any
taint,
it
disappeared
by
the
time
they
gave
the
third
confession.
now,
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
apparently
the
officers
weren't
satisfied
that
the
version
that
he
gave
in
the
first
two
was
not
altogether
true.
that's
why
the
third
--
took
third
confession
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
our
argument
for
that
your
honor,
that's
true,
but
our
argument
for
that
is
that
if
petitioner
had
wanted
those
two
confessions,
those
two
prior
confessions
he
should
have
asked
for
them
when
the
officers
testified
on
the
third
confession
or
any
of
those
officers
when
they
testified
he
could
have
asked
for
them
under
the
holding
of
gaskin
versus
state
of
texas.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
before
the
trial
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
now,
during
the
trial
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress,
heard,
but
i
can't
find
anywhere
in
the
record
where
he
actually
said
your
honor
let
me
see
those
two
confessions,
we
want
to
look
at
them.
we
want
to
use
them
to
cross-examine
these
officers.
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
our
position
exactly
your
honor,
under
the
holding
of
gaskin.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
him
or
the
court
would
have
had
to
allow
him
to
perfect
his
bill
of
exceptions
so
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
have
looked
at
them
to
find
out
that
if
there's
anything
he
could
use
to
cross-examine
those
witnesses.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
gaskin
case
holds.
they
refused
to
follow
the
jencks
case
or
the
jencks
act
but
i
do
say
that
he's
entitled
to
let
the
court
look
at
it
so
that
he
can
convince
the
court
or
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
could
have
use
it
to
cross-examine
and
to
impeach
the
witnesses,
but
he
didn't
do
it
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
both
your
honor
because
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
specifically
held
that
we
will
not
follow
the
jencks
rule.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
they
will
not
follow
the
jencks
act
or
the
jencks
case,
that's
section
3500
in
title
18,
the
so
called
jencks
act.
and
in
any
event
jencks
act
requires
that
they're
entitled
to
the
production
of
those
instruments
only
after
the
witness
has
testified
not
before
trial.
now
we
have
adopted
a
new
system
and
a
new
code
where
he's
entitled
to
them
now
by
bill
of
discovery.
now,
the
petitioner
testified
during
the
trial
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
they've
changed
the
law.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
it
is
--
no,
the
legislature
did
in
the
last
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
this
morning,
in
fact
it's
more
liberal
than
section
3500
of
title
18.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
by
statute
your
honor
--
statute.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir,
new
rules.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
in
a
statute
form,
so
this
problem
wouldn't
arise
anymore.
now,
admittedly
when
the
third
confession
was
given,
the
petitioner
had
visitors
in
the
jail.
he
had
talked
to
his
sister-in-law,
to
his
--
i
mean
his
mother-in-law
and
two
other
ladies
and
mrs.
johnson
and
some
other
ladies,
he
had
talked
in
private
with
an
attorney,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
h.
s.
harris.
now,
he
came
to
visit
him
in
the
jailhouse,
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
officers
on
thursday
morning
before
he
gave
the
second
confession
and
the
testimony
is
from
his
own
mouth
that
he
conferred
with
him
in
private.
now,
we
don't
know
what
happened.
if
we
did,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
his
rights
so
we
cannot
argue
that
that
lawyer
had
informed
him
of
his
rights,
but
we
must
be
allowed
to
assume
that
they
must
have
talked
about
the
case
and
secondly,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
man
was
coerced,
it
was
his
own
testimony.
now,
why
were
any
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
all
of
it
is
in
dispute
except
made
for
the
times
that
he
was
taken
from
the
jail
to
borger
where
the
truck,
pound
truck
he
was
driving
in
was
searched
that
was
admitted,
the
fact
that
he
was
taken
out
to
the
grave,
now
that
was
admitted.
the
fact
that
he
was
questioned,
that's
admitted,
but
the
fact
that
he
says
that
he
was
questioned
past
midnight
with
all
of
those
three
officers
who
testified
the
trial
where
they
were
in
charge
of
the
keys
to
the
jail.
they
were
in
jail,
so
they
didn't
allow
anybody
in
or
out
of
the
cell
past
midnight
for
this
conflicting
testimony
in
that.
now,
there's
also
--
he
claims
that
he
was
taken
to
a
border
300
miles
away.
the
record
shows
that,
at
page
135
or
134
that
he
voluntarily
consented
to
have
the
search
on
the
truck
maker
and
the
voluntary
statement
that
he
signed
allowing
the
search
of
the
truck
was
offered
in
try
--
at
the
trial
state's
exhibit
number
10,
and
that
was
admitted
without
any
single
objection.
so
the
reason
that
he
went
to
the
borger
was
because
he
had
consented
to
the
search.
now,
in
borger
he
talked
to
his
brother-in-law
there
and
he
--
a
fellow
by
name
of
malone,
this
the
officer
testified
to
that.
now,
he
says
that
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
abused
back
in
borger.
the
officer
of
course
denied
it.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
testimony
is
really
overwhelming
on
the
side
of
the
police
officers
from
the
assistant
chief
of
the
police
who
picked
him
up
on
thursday
morning.
he
says
he
talked
to
him,
he
asked
him
if
he
had
been
abused.
he
said
“no,
he
hadn't
been
abused.”
this
was
after
he
had
given
his
second
confession.
so
the
testimony
is
really
in
a
mess
as
far
as,
as
whether
or
not
he
was
or
wasn't,
we
got
the
testimony
both
ways.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
something
that
i
would
never
be
able
to
understand
from
the
testimony
of
the
officer
and
he
was
investigating
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
they
were
investigating
the
disappearance
of
his
wife
and
this
is
why
they
were
talking
to
him.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
i
really
can't.
i
don't
see
anywhere
where
they
--
we
will
concede
for
the
record
that
the
arrest
was
illegal.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question
about
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
was
illegal,
there
was
no
probable
cause
of
the
arrest
at
that
time.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir.
on
monday
night
he
went
to
the
--
before
the
magistrate,
he
was
before
a
magistrate
and
he
was
then
lawfully
entered
in
jail.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
alright,
let
me
answer
this
by
saying
that
your
honor
to
the
statement
of
facts
where
he
testified
that
on
tuesday
--
alright,
now
monday
he
gave
the
confession,
he
went
before
the
magistrate,
on
tuesday
he
testified
that
he
wasn't
bothered
by
anybody.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
wasn't
bothered
by
anybody
or
abused.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
in
the
record
page
144.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
first
confession.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
went
to
the
magistrate
afterwards
then
he
was
sent
back
to
jail.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
alright,
now
the
second
confession
was
taken
on
thursday.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
now
by
the
way,
he
did
consent
at
the
--
to
the
taking
of
the
polygraph
tests,
so
this
was
the
reason
why
he
was
taken
for
the
safety,
that's
on
page
135
or
134.
he
admits
that.
alright,
now
by
the
time
he
gave
the
third
confession
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
there's
quite
a
few
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
--
i
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
have
any
dispute
on
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no.
it
doesn't,
i
can
cite
to
where
he
consented
to
four
of
them,
but
i
don't
--
there's
some
testimony
he
didn't
consent
to
the
others
from
him.
we
have
testimony
the
other
way.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
first
of
all,
of
course
he
answers
it
didn't
make
any
difference
because
the
case
is
going
to
go
if
the
confession
was
illegal,
but
the
answer
to
your
question,
the
--
there
was
an
eye
--
the
mother-in-law
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that
if
the
confession
is
illegal
or
involuntary,
was
not
voluntary
then
the
conviction
as
i
understand
the
law,
he
cannot
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
just
testimony
from
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
who
testified
that
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
she
witnessed
where
the
petitioner
was
choking
his
mother
and
telling
her
he
was
going
to
kill
her
and
the
other
witness
was
the
mother-in-law
who
testified
that
on
one
occasion
she
came
into
the
house
and
saw
him
holding
a
pistol
to
the
woman's
face,
he
was
going
to
kill
her.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
there
was
some
circumstantial
evidence
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that
that's
mainly
it,
the
confession
was
really
it.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
believe
that's
the
inference
from
the
record.
i
can't
really
pinpoint
it
for
you
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right.
now,
the
belt
was
identified
though
by
the
daughter
as
being
the
belt
that
his
mama
used,
that
her
mom
used
to
use
to
whip
the
kids.
and
also
there
was
her
--
the
shoes
that
she
was
wearing
the
last
time
she
was
seen
was
found
on
the
truck
in
borger,
that's
what
they
were
doing
out
there,
searching
the
truck.
so
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
shoes
were
in
the
truck.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
in
the
truck
the
petitioner
used
to
drive
your
honor.
he
was
a
foreman
for
a
pipeline
crew
in
borger.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
no
sir.
no.
the
body
was
found
by
two
latin-american
boys
one
day.
they
called
the
sheriff's
department,
they
went
out
and
excavated
the
bones.
now,
that
saturday
he
was
called
--
the
sheriff's
department
called
his
sister
i
believe,
or
sister-in-law
or
something
like
that
and
told
her
that
next
time
she
saw
the
petitioner,
tell
him
to
come
by
the
--
by
the
sheriff's
department.
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
it.
and
that's
--
she
called
him
in
borger
and
told
him
they
wanted
to
talk
to
you
down
here
in
midlands,
come
on
down.
so
he
did.
he
drove
down
there
saturday
night.
he
drove
straight
to
the
sheriff's
office
and
talked
to
the
deputy
sheriff
there
for
about
three
or
four
hours
and
then
he
went
home.
then
the
next
day
is
when
he
was
arrested
by
that
officer
morales.
but
let's
look
at
the
petitioner
here,
we
don't
have
a
petitioner
here
or
defendant
who
was
an
uneducated
or
ignorant
at
first
like
we
have
in
so
many
other
cases
that
this
court
had
ruled
down
where
there
was
19-year-old
negro
boy
who
was
an
imbecile
or
had
a
mentality
for
a
3-year-old.
here
we
have
a
case
where
this
man
is
37
years
of
age.
he
had
served
three
years
in
the
navy.
now
that
to
me
is
significant
because
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
had
finished
the
fifth
grade,
that's
right
your
honor.
but
he
had
been
foreman
of
a
pipeline
crew
for
seven
years.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
did
not
have
a
what,
your
honor?
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right
your
honor.
but
--
and
he
was
no
pauper
because
he
wasn't
represented
by
an
in
--
he
was
not
represented
by
the
court
appointed
counsel
below.
now,
he
had
conferred
with
a
lawyer
before
he
gave
his
last
two
confessions
and
certainly
before
he
gave
his
third,
he
had
not
been
held
incommunicado
because
he
made
several
phone
calls.
he
had
been
visited
in
the
jailhouse.
he
had
already
been
before
a
magistrate
and
he
testifies
that
no
--
everybody
treated
him
just
real
fine
in
the
sheriff's
office.
and
that
he
had
no
dispute
as
to
the
--
that
last
confession
about
whether
or
not
he
was
--
there
was
any
coercion
or
threats.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
deputy
sheriff
jean
howe
testified
that
before
he
took
the
confession,
he
told
him
“advised
him
of
his
rights
to
remain
silent”.
and
he
asked
him
if
he
want
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
or
a
master
or
somebody
else
and
he
said,
“no,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
boss
man.”
so
the
deputy
sheriff
called
his
boss
man
but
nobody
answered.
what
he
would
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that
was
before
the
third
confession.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
third.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
third
confession.
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
oh
yes
sir,
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
now
before
the
first
or
second
your
honor,
the
record
is
silent.
they
say
that
if
he
wasn't
given
one
of
course,
we
can't
say
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
because
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir,
he
didn't
testify
on
that
subject.
but
in
texas
if
that
warning
is
not
in
the
confession,
it's
not
used.
you
can't
use
it
in
the
court
and
certainly
oral
confessions
are
not
admissible
in
the
state.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir,
we
sure
do.
we
contend
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
--
admissible
because
it
already
had
been
before
a
magistrate,
he
had
conferred
with
a
lawyer,
i
don't
know
what
happened
in
there
but
nobody
does.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right,
that's
why
we
can't
argue
that
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right.
so
we
can't
--
we
don't
know.
but
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
an
attorney
in
private.
he
had
had
many
visitors
in
jail.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
day
that
he
says
he
don't
have
anything
to
eat,
on
sunday,
his
own
mother-in-law
brought
him
some
soup
to
the
jail
because
he
wanted
some
special
--
he
had
an
ulcer,
that's
what
he
said.
and
he
was
offered
that
soup,
now
they
testified
to
that
and
he
says
he
didn't
want
any.
he
was
offered
--
the
record
was
just
full
of
occasions
when
he
was
offered
food.
now
there's
testimony
they
saw
him
out
of
the
department
of
public
safety
smoking
a
cigar,
drinking
a
coke.
there
were
occasions
when
they
stopped
by
the
road
to
buy
him
some
milk.
they
brought
him
some
soup
to
the
jail.
there's
testimony
on
that
that
they
warmed
it
up
for
him
because
he
gotten
back
a
little
late.
he
ate
it,
he
drank
it
there,
i
mean,
the
soup.
he
was
allowed
to
use
the
phone.
and
the
only
time
he
says
he
wasn't
allowed
to
use
the
phone
was
sunday.
he
says
he
wasn't
allowed
to
call
his
sister.
that
he
said
this
upset
him
because
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
sister
before
she
came
to
visit
him.
so
he
wasn't
held
incommunicado.
so
i
think
that
it's
our
position
that
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
those
are
the
two
confessions
were
illegal,
because
we
do
have
an
illegal
arrest
but
i
don't
see
any
connection.
as
far
as
our
state
is
concerned
it's
not
the
illegal
arrest
but
the
illegal
detention
that
would
vitiate
a
confession.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
would
this
court
has
handed
down
which
says
an
illegal
arrest
ipso
facto
remove
any
voluntary
--
voluntariness
to
the
confession.
so
that
was
the
position
that
the
first
two
confession
were
really
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
certainly
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
--
a
question
that
would
go
directly
into
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
but
here
--
and
it
would
be
something
to
argue
to
the
court
and
have
the
jury
pass
upon.
in
this
case
the
jury
heard
all
this
evidence
and
the
court
heard
all
this
evidence
by
itself
for
a
matter
of
one
day,
testimony
on
the
confessions
and
the
court
resolved
this
issue
against
him.
the
jury
heard
it
and
they
resolve
it
against
him
too.
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
saying
that
there
was
--
that
the
court
had
resolved
it
and
they
took
the
confessions
voluntary
also.
so
at
the
most
we
have
a
situation
where
they
--
the
facts
surrounding
the
first
two
confessions
is
completely
muddled
because
i
really
can't
make
too
much
sense
of
the
record
as
it
appears
there's
contradiction
from
both
sides.
he
says
he
was
questioned
on
tuesday,
all
the
officers
testified
that
on
that
day
they
never
saw
him.
also
morales
was
off
that
day,
he
didn't
even
work
that
day
and
he
says
that
he
was
questioned
by
officer
morales
on
tuesday.
so
unless
there
weren't
any
questions
that's
all
we
have.
thank
you.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
here
we
have
a
case
before
us
which
the
facts
are
completely
in
a
state
of
chaos
and
are
conflicting.
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
himself
is
conflicting
on
several
portions
of
the
record,
but
we
--
our
position
is
two-fold.
one,
that
the
first
two
confessions
were
not
coerced
but
were
indeed
voluntary.
and
number
two,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
first
two
confessions
were
involuntary
then
certainly
the
third
confession
was
by
his
own
admission
voluntary
and
that
under
some
of
the
holdings
of
this
court
so
much
time
had
transpired
from
the
first
two
confessions
and
he
had
been
removed
away
from
the
coercive
atmosphere
which
they
alleged
existed
that
the
third
confession
was
so
far
removed
from
the
other
two
that
if
there
was
any
taint,
it
disappeared
by
the
time
they
gave
the
third
confession.
now,
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
apparently
the
officers
weren't
satisfied
that
the
version
that
he
gave
in
the
first
two
was
not
altogether
true.
that's
why
the
third
--
took
third
confession
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
our
argument
for
that
your
honor,
that's
true,
but
our
argument
for
that
is
that
if
petitioner
had
wanted
those
two
confessions,
those
two
prior
confessions
he
should
have
asked
for
them
when
the
officers
testified
on
the
third
confession
or
any
of
those
officers
when
they
testified
he
could
have
asked
for
them
under
the
holding
of
gaskin
versus
state
of
texas.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
before
the
trial
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
now,
during
the
trial
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress,
heard,
but
i
can't
find
anywhere
in
the
record
where
he
actually
said
your
honor
let
me
see
those
two
confessions,
we
want
to
look
at
them.
we
want
to
use
them
to
cross-examine
these
officers.
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
our
position
exactly
your
honor,
under
the
holding
of
gaskin.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
him
or
the
court
would
have
had
to
allow
him
to
perfect
his
bill
of
exceptions
so
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
have
looked
at
them
to
find
out
that
if
there's
anything
he
could
use
to
cross-examine
those
witnesses.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
gaskin
case
holds.
they
refused
to
follow
the
jencks
case
or
the
jencks
act
but
i
do
say
that
he's
entitled
to
let
the
court
look
at
it
so
that
he
can
convince
the
court
or
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
could
have
use
it
to
cross-examine
and
to
impeach
the
witnesses,
but
he
didn't
do
it
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
both
your
honor
because
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
specifically
held
that
we
will
not
follow
the
jencks
rule.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
they
will
not
follow
the
jencks
act
or
the
jencks
case,
that's
section
3500
in
title
18,
the
so
called
jencks
act.
and
in
any
event
jencks
act
requires
that
they're
entitled
to
the
production
of
those
instruments
only
after
the
witness
has
testified
not
before
trial.
now
we
have
adopted
a
new
system
and
a
new
code
where
he's
entitled
to
them
now
by
bill
of
discovery.
now,
the
petitioner
testified
during
the
trial
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
they've
changed
the
law.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
it
is
--
no,
the
legislature
did
in
the
last
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
this
morning,
in
fact
it's
more
liberal
than
section
3500
of
title
18.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
by
statute
your
honor
--
statute.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir,
new
rules.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
in
a
statute
form,
so
this
problem
wouldn't
arise
anymore.
now,
admittedly
when
the
third
confession
was
given,
the
petitioner
had
visitors
in
the
jail.
he
had
talked
to
his
sister-in-law,
to
his
--
i
mean
his
mother-in-law
and
two
other
ladies
and
mrs.
johnson
and
some
other
ladies,
he
had
talked
in
private
with
an
attorney,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
h.
s.
harris.
now,
he
came
to
visit
him
in
the
jailhouse,
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
officers
on
thursday
morning
before
he
gave
the
second
confession
and
the
testimony
is
from
his
own
mouth
that
he
conferred
with
him
in
private.
now,
we
don't
know
what
happened.
if
we
did,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
his
rights
so
we
cannot
argue
that
that
lawyer
had
informed
him
of
his
rights,
but
we
must
be
allowed
to
assume
that
they
must
have
talked
about
the
case
and
secondly,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
man
was
coerced,
it
was
his
own
testimony.
now,
why
were
any
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
all
of
it
is
in
dispute
except
made
for
the
times
that
he
was
taken
from
the
jail
to
borger
where
the
truck,
pound
truck
he
was
driving
in
was
searched
that
was
admitted,
the
fact
that
he
was
taken
out
to
the
grave,
now
that
was
admitted.
the
fact
that
he
was
questioned,
that's
admitted,
but
the
fact
that
he
says
that
he
was
questioned
past
midnight
with
all
of
those
three
officers
who
testified
the
trial
where
they
were
in
charge
of
the
keys
to
the
jail.
they
were
in
jail,
so
they
didn't
allow
anybody
in
or
out
of
the
cell
past
midnight
for
this
conflicting
testimony
in
that.
now,
there's
also
--
he
claims
that
he
was
taken
to
a
border
300
miles
away.
the
record
shows
that,
at
page
135
or
134
that
he
voluntarily
consented
to
have
the
search
on
the
truck
maker
and
the
voluntary
statement
that
he
signed
allowing
the
search
of
the
truck
was
offered
in
try
--
at
the
trial
state's
exhibit
number
10,
and
that
was
admitted
without
any
single
objection.
so
the
reason
that
he
went
to
the
borger
was
because
he
had
consented
to
the
search.
now,
in
borger
he
talked
to
his
brother-in-law
there
and
he
--
a
fellow
by
name
of
malone,
this
the
officer
testified
to
that.
now,
he
says
that
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
abused
back
in
borger.
the
officer
of
course
denied
it.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
testimony
is
really
overwhelming
on
the
side
of
the
police
officers
from
the
assistant
chief
of
the
police
who
picked
him
up
on
thursday
morning.
he
says
he
talked
to
him,
he
asked
him
if
he
had
been
abused.
he
said
“no,
he
hadn't
been
abused.”
this
was
after
he
had
given
his
second
confession.
so
the
testimony
is
really
in
a
mess
as
far
as,
as
whether
or
not
he
was
or
wasn't,
we
got
the
testimony
both
ways.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
something
that
i
would
never
be
able
to
understand
from
the
testimony
of
the
officer
and
he
was
investigating
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
they
were
investigating
the
disappearance
of
his
wife
and
this
is
why
they
were
talking
to
him.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
i
really
can't.
i
don't
see
anywhere
where
they
--
we
will
concede
for
the
record
that
the
arrest
was
illegal.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question
about
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
was
illegal,
there
was
no
probable
cause
of
the
arrest
at
that
time.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir.
on
monday
night
he
went
to
the
--
before
the
magistrate,
he
was
before
a
magistrate
and
he
was
then
lawfully
entered
in
jail.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
alright,
let
me
answer
this
by
saying
that
your
honor
to
the
statement
of
facts
where
he
testified
that
on
tuesday
--
alright,
now
monday
he
gave
the
confession,
he
went
before
the
magistrate,
on
tuesday
he
testified
that
he
wasn't
bothered
by
anybody.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
wasn't
bothered
by
anybody
or
abused.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
in
the
record
page
144.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
first
confession.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
went
to
the
magistrate
afterwards
then
he
was
sent
back
to
jail.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
alright,
now
the
second
confession
was
taken
on
thursday.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
now
by
the
way,
he
did
consent
at
the
--
to
the
taking
of
the
polygraph
tests,
so
this
was
the
reason
why
he
was
taken
for
the
safety,
that's
on
page
135
or
134.
he
admits
that.
alright,
now
by
the
time
he
gave
the
third
confession
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
there's
quite
a
few
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
--
i
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
have
any
dispute
on
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no.
it
doesn't,
i
can
cite
to
where
he
consented
to
four
of
them,
but
i
don't
--
there's
some
testimony
he
didn't
consent
to
the
others
from
him.
we
have
testimony
the
other
way.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
first
of
all,
of
course
he
answers
it
didn't
make
any
difference
because
the
case
is
going
to
go
if
the
confession
was
illegal,
but
the
answer
to
your
question,
the
--
there
was
an
eye
--
the
mother-in-law
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that
if
the
confession
is
illegal
or
involuntary,
was
not
voluntary
then
the
conviction
as
i
understand
the
law,
he
cannot
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
just
testimony
from
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
who
testified
that
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
she
witnessed
where
the
petitioner
was
choking
his
mother
and
telling
her
he
was
going
to
kill
her
and
the
other
witness
was
the
mother-in-law
who
testified
that
on
one
occasion
she
came
into
the
house
and
saw
him
holding
a
pistol
to
the
woman's
face,
he
was
going
to
kill
her.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
there
was
some
circumstantial
evidence
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that
that's
mainly
it,
the
confession
was
really
it.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
believe
that's
the
inference
from
the
record.
i
can't
really
pinpoint
it
for
you
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right.
now,
the
belt
was
identified
though
by
the
daughter
as
being
the
belt
that
his
mama
used,
that
her
mom
used
to
use
to
whip
the
kids.
and
also
there
was
her
--
the
shoes
that
she
was
wearing
the
last
time
she
was
seen
was
found
on
the
truck
in
borger,
that's
what
they
were
doing
out
there,
searching
the
truck.
so
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
shoes
were
in
the
truck.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
in
the
truck
the
petitioner
used
to
drive
your
honor.
he
was
a
foreman
for
a
pipeline
crew
in
borger.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
no
sir.
no.
the
body
was
found
by
two
latin-american
boys
one
day.
they
called
the
sheriff's
department,
they
went
out
and
excavated
the
bones.
now,
that
saturday
he
was
called
--
the
sheriff's
department
called
his
sister
i
believe,
or
sister-in-law
or
something
like
that
and
told
her
that
next
time
she
saw
the
petitioner,
tell
him
to
come
by
the
--
by
the
sheriff's
department.
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
it.
and
that's
--
she
called
him
in
borger
and
told
him
they
wanted
to
talk
to
you
down
here
in
midlands,
come
on
down.
so
he
did.
he
drove
down
there
saturday
night.
he
drove
straight
to
the
sheriff's
office
and
talked
to
the
deputy
sheriff
there
for
about
three
or
four
hours
and
then
he
went
home.
then
the
next
day
is
when
he
was
arrested
by
that
officer
morales.
but
let's
look
at
the
petitioner
here,
we
don't
have
a
petitioner
here
or
defendant
who
was
an
uneducated
or
ignorant
at
first
like
we
have
in
so
many
other
cases
that
this
court
had
ruled
down
where
there
was
19-year-old
negro
boy
who
was
an
imbecile
or
had
a
mentality
for
a
3-year-old.
here
we
have
a
case
where
this
man
is
37
years
of
age.
he
had
served
three
years
in
the
navy.
now
that
to
me
is
significant
because
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
had
finished
the
fifth
grade,
that's
right
your
honor.
but
he
had
been
foreman
of
a
pipeline
crew
for
seven
years.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
he
did
not
have
a
what,
your
honor?
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right
your
honor.
but
--
and
he
was
no
pauper
because
he
wasn't
represented
by
an
in
--
he
was
not
represented
by
the
court
appointed
counsel
below.
now,
he
had
conferred
with
a
lawyer
before
he
gave
his
last
two
confessions
and
certainly
before
he
gave
his
third,
he
had
not
been
held
incommunicado
because
he
made
several
phone
calls.
he
had
been
visited
in
the
jailhouse.
he
had
already
been
before
a
magistrate
and
he
testifies
that
no
--
everybody
treated
him
just
real
fine
in
the
sheriff's
office.
and
that
he
had
no
dispute
as
to
the
--
that
last
confession
about
whether
or
not
he
was
--
there
was
any
coercion
or
threats.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
deputy
sheriff
jean
howe
testified
that
before
he
took
the
confession,
he
told
him
“advised
him
of
his
rights
to
remain
silent”.
and
he
asked
him
if
he
want
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
or
a
master
or
somebody
else
and
he
said,
“no,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
boss
man.”
so
the
deputy
sheriff
called
his
boss
man
but
nobody
answered.
what
he
would
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that
was
before
the
third
confession.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
third.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
third
confession.
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
oh
yes
sir,
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
now
before
the
first
or
second
your
honor,
the
record
is
silent.
they
say
that
if
he
wasn't
given
one
of
course,
we
can't
say
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
because
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir,
he
didn't
testify
on
that
subject.
but
in
texas
if
that
warning
is
not
in
the
confession,
it's
not
used.
you
can't
use
it
in
the
court
and
certainly
oral
confessions
are
not
admissible
in
the
state.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir,
we
sure
do.
we
contend
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
--
admissible
because
it
already
had
been
before
a
magistrate,
he
had
conferred
with
a
lawyer,
i
don't
know
what
happened
in
there
but
nobody
does.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right,
that's
why
we
can't
argue
that
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right.
so
we
can't
--
we
don't
know.
but
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
an
attorney
in
private.
he
had
had
many
visitors
in
jail.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
day
that
he
says
he
don't
have
anything
to
eat,
on
sunday,
his
own
mother-in-law
brought
him
some
soup
to
the
jail
because
he
wanted
some
special
--
he
had
an
ulcer,
that's
what
he
said.
and
he
was
offered
that
soup,
now
they
testified
to
that
and
he
says
he
didn't
want
any.
he
was
offered
--
the
record
was
just
full
of
occasions
when
he
was
offered
food.
now
there's
testimony
they
saw
him
out
of
the
department
of
public
safety
smoking
a
cigar,
drinking
a
coke.
there
were
occasions
when
they
stopped
by
the
road
to
buy
him
some
milk.
they
brought
him
some
soup
to
the
jail.
there's
testimony
on
that
that
they
warmed
it
up
for
him
because
he
gotten
back
a
little
late.
he
ate
it,
he
drank
it
there,
i
mean,
the
soup.
he
was
allowed
to
use
the
phone.
and
the
only
time
he
says
he
wasn't
allowed
to
use
the
phone
was
sunday.
he
says
he
wasn't
allowed
to
call
his
sister.
that
he
said
this
upset
him
because
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
sister
before
she
came
to
visit
him.
so
he
wasn't
held
incommunicado.
so
i
think
that
it's
our
position
that
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
those
are
the
two
confessions
were
illegal,
because
we
do
have
an
illegal
arrest
but
i
don't
see
any
connection.
as
far
as
our
state
is
concerned
it's
not
the
illegal
arrest
but
the
illegal
detention
that
would
vitiate
a
confession.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
would
this
court
has
handed
down
which
says
an
illegal
arrest
ipso
facto
remove
any
voluntary
--
voluntariness
to
the
confession.
so
that
was
the
position
that
the
first
two
confession
were
really
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
certainly
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
--
a
question
that
would
go
directly
into
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
but
here
--
and
it
would
be
something
to
argue
to
the
court
and
have
the
jury
pass
upon.
in
this
case
the
jury
heard
all
this
evidence
and
the
court
heard
all
this
evidence
by
itself
for
a
matter
of
one
day,
testimony
on
the
confessions
and
the
court
resolved
this
issue
against
him.
the
jury
heard
it
and
they
resolve
it
against
him
too.
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
saying
that
there
was
--
that
the
court
had
resolved
it
and
they
took
the
confessions
voluntary
also.
so
at
the
most
we
have
a
situation
where
they
--
the
facts
surrounding
the
first
two
confessions
is
completely
muddled
because
i
really
can't
make
too
much
sense
of
the
record
as
it
appears
there's
contradiction
from
both
sides.
he
says
he
was
questioned
on
tuesday,
all
the
officers
testified
that
on
that
day
they
never
saw
him.
also
morales
was
off
that
day,
he
didn't
even
work
that
day
and
he
says
that
he
was
questioned
by
officer
morales
on
tuesday.
so
unless
there
weren't
any
questions
that's
all
we
have.
thank
you.
