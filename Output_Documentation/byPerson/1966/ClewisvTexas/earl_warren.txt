chief

during
those
three
days
was
he
represented
by
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
subject
to
--
subject
to
what
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
pena.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
a
probable
cause
for
his
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
put
him
in
jail
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
they
trying
to
do
when
they
put
him
in
jail
as
a
prisoner?
as
far
as
talking
to
him,
what
was
the
purpose
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
but
why
did
they
put
him
in
jail?
couldn't
they
talk
to
him
at
his
home
because
they
talk
to
him
where
they
--
some
place
where
he'd
have
the
advice
of
counsel,
the
advice
of
his
friends.
why
did
they
put
him
in
jail
if
they
had
no
probable
cause
for
arresting
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
concede
that
he
was
held
there
from
the
time
that
he
was
arrested
for
these
several
days
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
confession
from
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
was
that
they
continue
then
to
try
to
get
a
confession
from
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
tests
did
they
make
of
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
seven
times?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
--
does
it
show
that
he
consented
to
all
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
--
what
is
that
you
said
at
the
beginning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
before
the
first,
the
second
or
the
third?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
the
first?
chief
justice
earl
warren
third?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
evidence
that
they
told
him
of
his
rights
before
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
the
way
along
the
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
the
first
even?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say?
did
he
testify
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
first
two
confessions
were
involuntary,
do
you
still
contend
that
the
third
one
is
admissible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
although
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
he
merely
asked
a
lawyer
if
he'd
represent
him
and
the
lawyer
said
no,
you
haven't
got
enough
money
or
something
of
that
kind.
that
doesn't
prove
anything
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
lawyer
never
represented
him,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
never
assume
to
represent
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
i
suppose
no
inference
can
be
drawn
that
he
advised
him
of
his
rights
or
anything
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
suppose
it
could
bear
on
it
though,
couldn't
it,
if
they
arrest
him
without
any
legal
cause
and
held
them
there
for
two
or
three
days
until
a
--
three
or
fours
days
until
they
got
the
confession
they
wanted
to
use
against
him
in
the
court,
but
would
you
think
that
could
bear
upon
whether
it
was
voluntary
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
