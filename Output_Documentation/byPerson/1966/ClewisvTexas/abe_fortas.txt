justice
abe
fortas
is
this
while
he
was
asserting
his
innocence?
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
--
does
the
record
show
what
the
results
were?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mr.
legg?
did
--
i
thought
you
had
asked
for
a
copies
for
the
first
two
confessions
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
request
was
denied?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
never
got
those
first
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
denied
or
just
--
did
the
state
say
anything
as
to
why
not
or
was
just
that
that
was
--
did
they
take
a
proposition
as
irrelevant?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
your
--
why
did
you
want
these
confessions?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
you
want
three
confessions?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
probably
the
reason
why
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
wanted
to
see
them?
wanted
to
see
the
first
two,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
counsel
said
he
asked
for
them
in
an
earlier
stage
as
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
oh.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
pressure
but
is
it
the
state's
view
that
if
he
had
asked
for
them
at
an
appropriate
time
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
them
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
your
position
is
that
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
him
if
he
had
asked
for
them
in
the
proper
time?
justice
abe
fortas
which
confession
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
which
confession
was
that
mr.
--
justice
abe
fortas
first
confession.
he
went
to
the
magistrate
after
the
first?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
when
did
they
get
number
two
or
number
three?
justice
abe
fortas
thursday.
justice
abe
fortas
he
had
finished
the
fifth
grade.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
think
they
could
take
a
judicial
notice
that
in
all
probability,
he
did
not
have
a
law
degree.
justice
abe
fortas
law
degree.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
legg
i'm
not
clear
on
some
procedural
points
here.
you
move
that
before
the
trial
for
that
all
three
suppressions
--
all
three
confessions
be
suppressed,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
connection
with
that
motion
did
you
ask
that
all
three
of
them
be
produced?
justice
abe
fortas
be
produced.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
was
the
judge
ruled
on
your
motion
before
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
judge
--
and
the
judge
denied
that
motion,
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
at
a
later
point
during
the
course
of
trial
and
first
start
of
hearing
with
the
jury
i
supposed
there
was
a
proceeding
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
the
state
offered
confession
number
three
and
there
was
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
was
admissible.
justice
abe
fortas
and
at
that
time
you
did
not
again
move
for
production
of
the
other
two
confessions?
justice
abe
fortas
prior
to
the
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
at
this
point.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
the
admissibility
of
confession
number
three
which
has
been
offered
by
the
state.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'd
like
to
see
them
because
i
didn't
see
it
in
your
brief,
perhaps
i
missed
it.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
think
that
your
adversary's
position
now
is
that
the

would

confessions
had
you
proceeded
in
an

to
demand
the
production
and
he
says
you
did
not
proceed
appropriately
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
becomes
a
point
of
some
significance.
justice
abe
fortas
now
where
does
that
appear,
is
that
--
did
you
just
make
that
request
subsequent
to
page
90?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
guess
that's
what
your
adversary
refers
to
then
fact
that
this
hearing
you
did
say
i
am
not
asking
for
the
confessions.
