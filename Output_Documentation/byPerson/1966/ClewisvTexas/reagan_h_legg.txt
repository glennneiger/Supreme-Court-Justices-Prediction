mr.
reagan
h.
legg
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
and
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
case
where
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
jury
for
the
offense
of
murder
in
a
texas
trial
court
and
assessed
to
punishment
of
25
years
in
the
penitentiary.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
we're
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
case
concerns,
principally
of
course,
the
admission
into
evidence
of
what
was
the
denominated
state's
exhibit
13
which
is
found
on
page
428
of
the
record
which
was
the
third
in
a
series
of
confessions
which
petitioner
had
signed
while
in
custody
of
the
police.
the
central
issue
i
think
in
the
case
evolves
down
to
whether
or
not
assuming,
as
i
think
we
may
at
least,
that
the
first
two
confessions
here
were
involuntary,
that
they
were
coerced
that
they
were
given
at
the
time
when
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
said,
the
petitioner's
will
were
overwhelming,
that
assuming
that
to
be
the
case
then
what
is
required
in
order
to
purify
the
effects
of
that
coercion
so
that
a
person
might
freely
and
voluntarily
make
a
subsequent
confession
concerning
the
same
things.
now,
there
was
in
this
case
of
course
a
petitioner
to
briefly
summarize,
had
never
been
in
trouble
before,
he
was
arrested
without
a
warrant
after
he
had
voluntarily
come
to
the
city
of
midland
in
response
to
a
request
communicated
to
his
sister
by
the
sheriff's
office
that
they
would
like
to
talk
to
him
about
some
bones
which
had
been
uncovered
some
two
miles
northwest
of
the
city.
he
left
immediately
and
came
directly
to
the
sheriff's
office
on
saturday
night
where
he
was
questioned
for
about
two
hours
and
told
to
go
home
and
to
return
the
following
morning
about
8:30
or
9:00
am
to
talk
to
the
sheriff.
he
did
go,
but
about
6
o'clock
the
next
morning,
a
city
police
officer
who
had
not
participated
in
the
investigation
of
the
case
and
he
testified
that
he
knew
very
little
about
the
case
went
to
the
place
where
the
petitioner
was
and
woke
him
up
at
6
o'clock
and
told
him
to
come
on
and
go
with
him.
he
took
him
then
to
the
city
jail
where
the
interrogation
process
began.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
that
was
an
arrest
and
i
believe
that
the
officer
concedes
mr.
justice
white
that
it
was
an
arrest.
he
was
asked
the
question
incidentally
at
the
trial
why
didn't
procure
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
he
testified
on
page
170
and
171
of
the
record
that
he
knew
that
he
did
not
have
grounds
sufficient
to
obtain
a
warrant.
he
did
testify
of
course
that
he
took
his
belongings
from
him
and
put
him
up
which
meant
that
he
locked
him
in
the
cell.
now,
that
police
officer,
the
witness
morales
testified
to
questioning
the
petitioner
at
least
six
hours
during
sunday.
the
petitioner
said
that
it
consisted
of
--
it
was
a
lot
more
time
in
the
night
that
he
was
questioned
almost
all
day.
the
police
officers
also
admitted
to
interrogating
him
at
night,
but
said
they
did
not
question
him
after
midnight.
the
petitioner
had
claimed
that
he
was
questioned
until
about
3
am
on
monday
morning.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
one
of
our
positions
on
this
appeal
that
the
arrest
being
illegal
and
it
being
a
fragment,
disavowed
all
of
the
police
officer
of
the
--
of
the
law
as
they
existed.
because
on
the
texas
law
is
i
think
we
point
that
in
our
briefs
where
we
cited
the
statutes,
there
was
no
cause
for
arresting
him
which
would
excuse
rather
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
here.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
this
is
what
it
comes
down
to.
the
--
and
in
order
to
get
to
that
sir,
i
think
that
the
contention
here
on
the
part
of
the
state
is
that
despite
the
coercion
which
i
think
in
effect
be
admitted
concerning
the
first
two
statements
that
because
three
days
then
passed
in
which
both
the
petitioner
and
the
state
admit
that
the
only
or
the
principal
certainly
coercive
circumstance
was
his
confinement
in
custody.
i
think
that
their
contention
is
that
that
had
been
attenuated.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
he
was
not.
there's
testimony
in
the
record
mr.
chief
justice
by
the
deputy
sheriff
who
testified
that
he
was
not
seen
by
counsel
and
to
their
knowledge
he
had
no
counsel.
the
three
days
of
course
is
the
question
i
think
which
we're
presented
with
in
this
case.
we
have
a
question
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
of
attenuation
not
only
of
the
illegal
arrest
but
of
course
also
of
the
coercive
conducts
of
the
police
officers
during
that
--
during
the
previous
facts.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
i've
attempted
to
create
these
two
questions.
i
believe
it
is
and
that's
the
way
it
has
been
presented
of
course
to
the
court
here.
but
certainly
it
is
a
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
if
not
an
independent
ground
that
they
say.
the
petitioner
of
course
has
testified
and
it
is
in
the
case
that
“i
didn't
figure
out,
i
had
no
choice,”
i
believe,
this
is
a
colored
man
who
couldn't
get
through
the
fifth
grade
in
school
who
however,
had
been
reasonably
responsible
and
held
a
reasonably
responsible
position
and
had
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
law
before.
on
tuesday
then,
he
was,
we're
not
going
into
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
which
i
think
we
detailed
greatly
in
the
brief,
a
fact
that
he
wasn't
fed
for
a
period
of
two
days
prior
to
his
first
confession
or
he
didn't
have
anything
to
eat.
the
fact
that
the
newspaper
had
reported
the
reporter
testified
that
the
office
--
that
the
officers
had
told
him
that
the
petitioner
said
just
prior
to
signing
the
first
confession
or
making
the
first
confession,
if
you'll
just
bring
me
some
milk
i'll
give
you
whatever
confession
you
want
and
sign
it.
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
adequate
sleep
or
rest
during
that
period
of
the
time
and
of
course
he
says
that
he
was
beaten,
he
was
cursed
and
he
was
threatened
and
abused
otherwise
by
the
officers.
he
was
taken
to
the
grave
where
they
told
him
they
had
dug
up
these
bones
of
what
was
believed
to
be
his
wife
who
had
disappeared
some
six
months
prior
to
this
attack.
he
was
not
taken
before
a
magistrate
of
course
until
38
hours
after
his
arrest.
he
was
not
advised
according
to
the
record
of
his
right
to
counsel
before
the
first
two
confessions.
there
is
no
or
any
oral
confession
which
he
has
testified
to
here
in
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
he
was
advised
to
his
right
to
remain
silent.
on
tuesday
morning
then
after
having
been
delivered
to
the
sheriff
on
friday
and
making
no
complaint
about
being
mistreated
by
the
officers
during
that
interim
from
late
friday
afternoon
to
early
tuesday
morning.
he
was
brought
down
the
sheriff's
office
about
9:30
in
the
morning.
he
again
denied
as
the
record
shows
he
had
done
repeatedly
during
the
previous
questioning,
he
again
denied
any
implication
in
this
case
or
in
the
knowledge
of
his
wife's
death
and
he
repeated
to
the
sheriff's
officers
the
fact
that
he
had
been
mistreated
by
the
officers
during
the
other
interrogations
at
that
time.
they
did
mention
to
him
that
they
might
want
him
to
take
some
more
lie
detector
test,
since
he
had
been
subjected
to
seven
of
those
during
the
previous
interrogations.
he
had
been
confined
of
course
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
to
seven
polygraph
examinations
your
honor.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
referred
to
in
the
record
post
line
text.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
each
of
them.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
the
--
he
was
confined
during
that
interrogation
in
jail
and
the
city
jail
in
midland,
texas
in
the
department
of
public
safety
jail
which
was
outside
the
city
limits
of
that
city
and
was
confined
in
a
jail
in
borger,
texas,
300
miles
away
where
has
was
taken
during
the
first
five
days
of
interrogation.
on
tuesday
morning
as
i
mentioned
he
was
brought
down
at
9:30
by
two
deputy
sheriffs.
he
again
denied
his
guilt.
they
mentioned
to
him
that
he
might
be
subjected
or
would
he
be
interested
in
taking
some
more
polygraph
tests.
he
did
then
say
that
he
would
like
to
talk
to
somebody
before
talking
--
going
any
further
with
them
and
they
asked
him
who
and
he
said
he
like
to
talk
to
his
boss,
and
they
went
to
the
phone
and
came
back
and
said
there
was
no
answer.
the
deputy
sheriffs
then
bought
then
the
district
attorney
who
talked
to
him
and
thereafter
he
did
orally
confess
then
the
confession
he
was
later
reduced
to
writing,
i
think
all
of
the
procedure
there
prior
to
the
ten
that
the
old
confession
was
about
an
hour
and
15
minutes
according
to
the
record.
his
testimony
was
when
asked
about
this
third
confession,
they
went
and
got
mr.
mends
and
when
they
went
and
got
him,
“well
i
was
scared
because
i
could
see
it
looked
like
the
same
thing
happening
all
over
again,
that
three
or
four
days
of
abusing.”
this
is
at
page
153
of
the
record,
“and
i
was
scared
and
i
didn't
think
i
could
take
that
no
more,
and
so
i
just
went
on
and
gave
them
the
statement
because
i
had
already
made
two
statements
and
i
didn't
figure
it
made
any
difference
and
i
had
signed
two.”
certainly,
the
position
of
petitioner
here
is
that
the
taint
had
not
been
attenuated.
once
a
man
is
broken
in
and
the
opinions
of
this
court,
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
many
instances
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
when
a
man
is
broken
in
or
when
he
is
subjected
to
tactics
reminiscing
of
the
imposition
that
has
happened
in
many
cases
that
certainly
it
takes
a
long
time
to
repair
the
damages
done
that
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
would
certainly
support
our
contention
that
once
a
man
has
been
broken
that
he's
no
longer
a
whole
man
and
that
considering
the
type
of
coercive
tactics
that
are
employed
against
him
that
it
would
take
him
certainly
more
than
three
days
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
that
treatment.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
it
isn't
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
--
the
state
hasn't
been
conceding
that.
we
are
saying
that
we
believe
that
the
facts
establish
it.
we
think
that
they
used
every
coercive
tactic
they
could
think
of
in
order
to
try
to
get
a
confession
out
of
this
man.
the
officers
did
admit
on
many
occasions
that
they
were
trying
to
get
a
confession
out
of
him.
that's
shown
in
the
record
from
the
testimony
of
the
various
officers
that
they
were
trying
to
get
him
to
tell
the
truth,
that
they
told
him
he
ought
to
make
a
statement
and
things
like
this.
i
think
that
it
is
conceded
certainly
by
the
state
and
by
the
testimony
of
their
officers
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
interrogation
and
of
all
the
tactics
employed
by
the
police
during
the
course
of
it
was
to
get
a
confession.
that
much
is
conceded
in
the
record.
we
have,
of
course
in
search
of
the
cases
of
this
court
for
examples
when
more
than
one
confession
has
been
considered
by
the
court,
only
however,
i
believe
in
this
case
does
the
proposition
come
up
where
they
did
not
use
but
the
third
confession,
and
this
was
the
only
confession
which
the
state
attempted
to
use.
the
others
were
brought
into
evidence
by
the
petitioner
for
a
simple
reason
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
try
to
demonstrate
the
inconsistency
of
those
statements.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
we
never
got
those
first
two
confessions.
we
made
a
motion
at
the
beginning
or
just
part
of
the
jury
selection
actually
for
the
state
to
produce
the
confessions
for
our
examination
and
the
trial
court
denied
that
request.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
the
discussion
on
that
motion
and
actually
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
and
they
accepted
the
position
of
being
denied,
that
was
made.
then
of
course,
we
did
thereafter
filed
a
motion
to
exclude
the
use
of
any
of
the
confessions
and
we
went
into
--
we
then
request
in
that
the
state
be
required
to
produce
them
for
examination
by
the
trial
judge
in
connection
with
our
motion.
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
which
we
are
urging
the
court,
urging
upon
the
court
as
the
ground
for
reversal
in
this
case
that
the
rules
certainly
which
now
are
applicable
in
all
federal
cases
that
require
the
granting
of
a
motion
for
discovery
and
provide
explicitly
that
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
see
and
examine
and
use
his
own
statements
should
be
extended
to
the
trials
in
criminal
cases
as
well
as
in
civil
cases.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
as
we
mentioned,
number
one,
and
we
have
stated
in
our
motion,
to
demonstrate
the
inconsistency
of
the
three
statements.
we
of
course
had
information
that
the
first
statement
said
that
–
first
confession
that
petitioner
signed
said
that
he
shot
her,
that
the
second
confession
deviated
in
other
respects
and
also
said
that
he
had
choked
her
with
a
belt.
we
of
course
have
contended
that
the
main
reason
that
these
are
the
two
confessions
were
taken
is
after
they
got
the
first
one
and
they
testified
to
this
said
that
he
had
shot
her
that
of
course
they
found
no
evidence
that
these
bones
it
was
completely
deteriorated.
no
evidence,
no
bullet,
no
evidence
of
being
shot
but
there
was
a
belt
around
the
neck,
and
--
so
we
felt
that
we
needed
to
demonstrate
this
to
the
jury
as
a
ground
of
--
as
a
means
of
demonstrating
a
coercion
which
had
been
practiced
upon
him.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
yes.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well
no.
actually,
it
was
before
testimony
was
begun
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
--
in
the
case
and
the
motion
to
exclude
and
suppress
the
confessions
which
is
what
we're
talking,
was
after
or
nearly
a
based
testimony.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
it
was
argued
as
they
begun
to
introduce
it
which
was
the
trial
and
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
--
in
about
a
day,
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
actually
we
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
we
argued
this
motion
which
confession
or
what
confessions
are
we
going
to
introduce
but
we
did
want
to
get
the
jury
out
of
the
room
before
we
went
into
that
and
it
was
a
motion
to
exclude
them
all
three.
and
in
connection
with
that
we
did
argue
that
yes,
they
should
be
produced
certainly
for
the
trial
court's
examination,
although
he
had
already
refused
our
request
to
have
them
made
available
to
us
before
that.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that's
correct,
yes.
the
questions
here
of
course
are
those
which
this
court
has
considered
many
times
before.
we
certainly
think
for
instance
and
have
urged
we
believe
that
the
failure
to
take
this
man
before
a
magistrate
when
he
was
first
arrested
was
a
very
vital
step
in
the
proceedings.
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
officer
admits
that
he
had
no
grounds
for
his
arrest.
here
we
have
a
case
where
certainly
one
other
law
enforcement
agency
knowing
that
there
was
no
ground
for
holding
him
had
sent
him
on
his
way
and
told
him
to
come
back
later
would
certainly
had
acted
within
the
law.
that
if
he
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
certainly
if
he
had
competent
counsel
which
he
did
not
have
at
the
time
of
these
proceedings,
if
he
had
had
competent
counsel
then
he
would
have
i
think
been
discharged
because
there
was
no
evidence
against
him
other
than
these
confessions
and
we
think
that
the
coercion
which
is
demonstrated
would
easily
have
been
shown.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
that
we're
arguing
about
taking
him
before
a
magistrate
mr.
justice
black
in
context
with
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
where
it
has
been
held
as
a
coercive
--
that
failure
to
do
so
has
been
held
to
be
a
coercive
circumstance.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
that
state
law
article
217
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
requires
that
when
a
person
is
arrested,
he
must
immediately
and
not
as
soon
as
convenient
as
in
the
federal
cases
but
he
must
immediately
be
taken
before
a
magistrate.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
for
the
purpose
of
examining
him
to
the
offense
among
others.
the
statute
itself
your
honor,
there
are
several
articles
which
cover
it
but
he
is
--
when
the
accused
has
been,
for
instance
article
245,
when
the
accused
has
been
brought
before
a
magistrate,
that
officer
shall
proceed
to
examine
and
to
the
truth
of
the
accusation
made
allowing
the
accused
however
sufficient
time
to
procure
counsel.
then
the
other
statutes
provide
that
the
same
rules
on
trials
prevail
in
hearings
before
the
magistrate
that
to
direct
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
it
--
it's
a
matter
of
commitment
to
bail,
that's
very
true.
but
of
course,
this
court
has
considered
this
in
pointer
versus
texas
and
has
withheld
i
think
the
questions
as
to
whether
it
is
such
a
vital
step
in
the
proceedings
against
the
defendant
as
to
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process
if
they
do
not
take
it.
we
have
urged
that
it
is
and
that
certainly
this
is
a
case
which
demonstrates
that
had
this
petitioner
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
counsel
had
been
procured
for
under
the
law
or
even
advised
as
we
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
he
was
even
understood
that
he
could
have
counsel
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
there
was
in
fact
apparently
no
hearing
whatever
before
the
magistrate,
certainly
nothing
was
introduced
in
evidence
at
that
hearing.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
he
had
already
confessed
your
honor
just
a
few
probably
less
than
an
hour
before.
there
is
evidence
of
course
that
petitioner
was
sick
at
the
time,
right
after
the
first
confession
and
that
he
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
it's
not
in
dispute.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
from
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
officers
who
testified
that
he
was
sick
and
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that
he
was
sick
and
had
some
trouble,
that
he
vomited
and
that
was
after
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
he
claims
that
he
was
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that
is
in
dispute,
yes.
the
officers
have
denied
that
they
did
inflict
any
physical
damage,
but
they
have
admitted
that
this
petitioner
had
nothing
to
eat
on
sunday
morning
until
late
monday
afternoon
when
he
was
given
the
milk
at
the
time
he
signed
the
first
confession.
they
also
even
admitted
that
on
the
second
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
say
he
was.
he
denies
it.
our
contention
of
course
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
mr.
justice
white
our
position
throughout
this
case
of
course
has
been
that
if
it
is
a
consideration
as
to
the
physical
state
of
a
defendant
who
is
being
held
and
interrogated
that
if
that
is
the
ultimate
question
and
if
we
are
as
they
said
understand
the
way
the
circumstances,
the
coercion
against
his
particular
circumstances
and
ability
to
resist
that
then
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
--
whether
he
was
offered
anything
to
eat
or
not.
the
question
is
what
was
his
actual
physical
condition?
this
has
been
our
argument
and
our
position.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well
this
question
whether
they're
going
to
believe
the
defendant
or
whether
they
are
going
to
believe
the
officers
i
suppose
if
that's
what
it
comes
into.
i
think,
i
believe
that
it
gets
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
that's
what
i
said.
i
don't
know
anything
else
to
say
with
that.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes,
the
evidence
was
given
to
the
jury,
and
jury
was
charged,
your
honor.
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
is
remaining
of
my
time.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
just
one
or
two
things
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
i
believe
that
the
record
does
show
beyond
the
question
that
this
petitioner
was
questioned
on
tuesday
not
for
any
great
length
of
time
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
officers
at
least.
but
they
do
admit
the
questioning
him
on
two
occasions.
he
says
that
he
was
questioned
on
tuesday
and
on
tuesday
night.
and
on
wednesday
then
he
was
taking
on
this
300-mile
round
trip.
along,
i
mean
in
connection
with
this
idea
foods
which
has
been
discussed.
i
think
if
--
he
was
offered
food
they
say,
the
officers
say.
he
denies
that
he
was
offered
any
food
at
all.
his
sister
substantiates
at
least
that
he
was
not
offered
any
food
on
sunday.
but
certainly
on
the
days
that
were
important
to
the
confessions
that
is
sunday
and
monday
and
wednesday
and
thursday.
he
didn't
eat
anything.
he
didn't
have
anything
to
eat
except
from
sunday
morning
to
monday
night,
one
coca
cola,
on
wednesday
when
they
took
him
to
borger,
one
cartoon
of
milk.
on
thursday,
nothing
all
day
long,
now
these
were
the
times
which
of
course
are
pertinent
and
of
course
the
first
two
confessions
were
concerned.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
your
honor
on
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
all
three
of
them
be
produced,
yes.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
now
this
is
shown
on
the
record.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
we
did
move
to
exclude
all
three
confessions.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no,
no,
at
this
point
that
we
talked
about.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
and
there's
a
colloquy
in
the
record
that
at
the
time
this
was
done
concerning
the
admissibility
or
concerning
the
productions
of
all
of
these
statements.
i
believed
that
my
adversary
has
mentioned
here
that
perhaps
we
have
waived
some
rights,
but
i
do
quote
from
--
to
you.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
don't
know
exactly
where
it
was,
i
can't
think.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
your
honor
that
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that
appears
to
be
the
contention
and
frankly
i
don't
know
of
any
appropriate
way
to
do
it.
i
guess
to
converse
the
state
as
i
understand
it
says
that
anytime
they
offer
a
confession
or
a
statement
in
the
evidence
that
then
at
that
point
you
can
demand
to
see
it
and
again.
now
at
the
time
that
we
demanded
to
see
it
here
and
moved
for
the
exclusion
of
all
three
statements,
admittedly
we
didn't
know
where
they're
going
to
try
to
introduce
all
three
of
them
or
just
one
of
them.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
introduced
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no.
they
never
did
offer
to
introduce
all
other
of
them
and
refused
to
produce
the
first
two.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
only
the
third.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
didn't.
mr.

third
one.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
the
third
one.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
fortas
in
connection
with
this
question
which
you
asked
if
i
may
answer,
the
colloquy
here
begins
on
page
87,
it
extends
to
two,
three
pages
in
connection
with
this
motion.
now,
the
prosecution
of
course
had
said
that
on
page
90,
“no
sir
your
honor,
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
confessions
at
all.
and
this
motion
is
no
good
as
it
is
right
now.
he's
not
entitled
--
he's
not
anymore
entitled
to
the
confessions
now
than
was
a
week
ago.”
whereupon
i
said
“i'm
not
asking
for
the
confessions.
i've
told
you
that
i
don't
even
care
to
see
them.”
well
now
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
had
already
been
told
that
we
weren't
going
to
see
it.
and
our
motion
had
been
denied
just
a
few
hours
before
when
we
asked
the
state
to
produce
them,
but
we
did
ask
that
they
be
produced
for
the
court
to
look
at
them
in
connection
with
this
second
motion
to
exclude
all
of
them
which
we
were
at
that
time
offered.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
i
think
it
--
on
page
91
we
have
in
the
middle
of
the
page
over
here
i
think
is
where
we
prior
to
say
this
as
well
as
on
page
91
or
90
where
we
did
say
that
the
court
has
got
the
right
to
look
at
it
and
we
were
asking
that
they
be
produced
for
the
court
to
examine
in
camera.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
and
at
that
particular
hearing
that
is
more
or
less
true.
we'd
already
been
told
we
weren't
going
to
see
it.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
sir?
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well
mr.
justice
black
if
i
did
say
that
and
i
know
i
did
not.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
did,
it
said
that
at
that
point
we
were
arguing
the
second
motion
now
which
was
an
independent
motion
and
we
had
already
been
denied
the
right
to
see
them.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
said
that
we
don't
want
to
see
them
right
now
but
we
do
want
the
judge
to
see
it.
mr.
reagan

no.
mr.
reagan

legg
i
don't

but
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes

i
did
and
in
effect
i
say
that
at

point
we
didn't

it.
mr.
reagan

we
were
trying

legg
i
did
say
that

honor.
i
said
i
am
not
asking

mr.
reagan

i'm
not
asking
for
the
confessions,
i

told

that
i
don't
even

i
want
to
tell
you
that
these
confessions
entered
inadmissible.
the
court
has
got
the
right
to
look
at
them
at
anytime
he
wants
to
and
can

connection
with
this

mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes

well
that
particular
conversation,
yes.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
and
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
case
where
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
jury
for
the
offense
of
murder
in
a
texas
trial
court
and
assessed
to
punishment
of
25
years
in
the
penitentiary.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
we're
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
case
concerns,
principally
of
course,
the
admission
into
evidence
of
what
was
the
denominated
state's
exhibit
13
which
is
found
on
page
428
of
the
record
which
was
the
third
in
a
series
of
confessions
which
petitioner
had
signed
while
in
custody
of
the
police.
the
central
issue
i
think
in
the
case
evolves
down
to
whether
or
not
assuming,
as
i
think
we
may
at
least,
that
the
first
two
confessions
here
were
involuntary,
that
they
were
coerced
that
they
were
given
at
the
time
when
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
said,
the
petitioner's
will
were
overwhelming,
that
assuming
that
to
be
the
case
then
what
is
required
in
order
to
purify
the
effects
of
that
coercion
so
that
a
person
might
freely
and
voluntarily
make
a
subsequent
confession
concerning
the
same
things.
now,
there
was
in
this
case
of
course
a
petitioner
to
briefly
summarize,
had
never
been
in
trouble
before,
he
was
arrested
without
a
warrant
after
he
had
voluntarily
come
to
the
city
of
midland
in
response
to
a
request
communicated
to
his
sister
by
the
sheriff's
office
that
they
would
like
to
talk
to
him
about
some
bones
which
had
been
uncovered
some
two
miles
northwest
of
the
city.
he
left
immediately
and
came
directly
to
the
sheriff's
office
on
saturday
night
where
he
was
questioned
for
about
two
hours
and
told
to
go
home
and
to
return
the
following
morning
about
8:30
or
9:00
am
to
talk
to
the
sheriff.
he
did
go,
but
about
6
o'clock
the
next
morning,
a
city
police
officer
who
had
not
participated
in
the
investigation
of
the
case
and
he
testified
that
he
knew
very
little
about
the
case
went
to
the
place
where
the
petitioner
was
and
woke
him
up
at
6
o'clock
and
told
him
to
come
on
and
go
with
him.
he
took
him
then
to
the
city
jail
where
the
interrogation
process
began.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
that
was
an
arrest
and
i
believe
that
the
officer
concedes
mr.
justice
white
that
it
was
an
arrest.
he
was
asked
the
question
incidentally
at
the
trial
why
didn't
procure
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
he
testified
on
page
170
and
171
of
the
record
that
he
knew
that
he
did
not
have
grounds
sufficient
to
obtain
a
warrant.
he
did
testify
of
course
that
he
took
his
belongings
from
him
and
put
him
up
which
meant
that
he
locked
him
in
the
cell.
now,
that
police
officer,
the
witness
morales
testified
to
questioning
the
petitioner
at
least
six
hours
during
sunday.
the
petitioner
said
that
it
consisted
of
--
it
was
a
lot
more
time
in
the
night
that
he
was
questioned
almost
all
day.
the
police
officers
also
admitted
to
interrogating
him
at
night,
but
said
they
did
not
question
him
after
midnight.
the
petitioner
had
claimed
that
he
was
questioned
until
about
3
am
on
monday
morning.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
one
of
our
positions
on
this
appeal
that
the
arrest
being
illegal
and
it
being
a
fragment,
disavowed
all
of
the
police
officer
of
the
--
of
the
law
as
they
existed.
because
on
the
texas
law
is
i
think
we
point
that
in
our
briefs
where
we
cited
the
statutes,
there
was
no
cause
for
arresting
him
which
would
excuse
rather
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
here.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
this
is
what
it
comes
down
to.
the
--
and
in
order
to
get
to
that
sir,
i
think
that
the
contention
here
on
the
part
of
the
state
is
that
despite
the
coercion
which
i
think
in
effect
be
admitted
concerning
the
first
two
statements
that
because
three
days
then
passed
in
which
both
the
petitioner
and
the
state
admit
that
the
only
or
the
principal
certainly
coercive
circumstance
was
his
confinement
in
custody.
i
think
that
their
contention
is
that
that
had
been
attenuated.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
he
was
not.
there's
testimony
in
the
record
mr.
chief
justice
by
the
deputy
sheriff
who
testified
that
he
was
not
seen
by
counsel
and
to
their
knowledge
he
had
no
counsel.
the
three
days
of
course
is
the
question
i
think
which
we're
presented
with
in
this
case.
we
have
a
question
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
of
attenuation
not
only
of
the
illegal
arrest
but
of
course
also
of
the
coercive
conducts
of
the
police
officers
during
that
--
during
the
previous
facts.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
i've
attempted
to
create
these
two
questions.
i
believe
it
is
and
that's
the
way
it
has
been
presented
of
course
to
the
court
here.
but
certainly
it
is
a
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
if
not
an
independent
ground
that
they
say.
the
petitioner
of
course
has
testified
and
it
is
in
the
case
that
“i
didn't
figure
out,
i
had
no
choice,”
i
believe,
this
is
a
colored
man
who
couldn't
get
through
the
fifth
grade
in
school
who
however,
had
been
reasonably
responsible
and
held
a
reasonably
responsible
position
and
had
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
law
before.
on
tuesday
then,
he
was,
we're
not
going
into
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
which
i
think
we
detailed
greatly
in
the
brief,
a
fact
that
he
wasn't
fed
for
a
period
of
two
days
prior
to
his
first
confession
or
he
didn't
have
anything
to
eat.
the
fact
that
the
newspaper
had
reported
the
reporter
testified
that
the
office
--
that
the
officers
had
told
him
that
the
petitioner
said
just
prior
to
signing
the
first
confession
or
making
the
first
confession,
if
you'll
just
bring
me
some
milk
i'll
give
you
whatever
confession
you
want
and
sign
it.
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
adequate
sleep
or
rest
during
that
period
of
the
time
and
of
course
he
says
that
he
was
beaten,
he
was
cursed
and
he
was
threatened
and
abused
otherwise
by
the
officers.
he
was
taken
to
the
grave
where
they
told
him
they
had
dug
up
these
bones
of
what
was
believed
to
be
his
wife
who
had
disappeared
some
six
months
prior
to
this
attack.
he
was
not
taken
before
a
magistrate
of
course
until
38
hours
after
his
arrest.
he
was
not
advised
according
to
the
record
of
his
right
to
counsel
before
the
first
two
confessions.
there
is
no
or
any
oral
confession
which
he
has
testified
to
here
in
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
he
was
advised
to
his
right
to
remain
silent.
on
tuesday
morning
then
after
having
been
delivered
to
the
sheriff
on
friday
and
making
no
complaint
about
being
mistreated
by
the
officers
during
that
interim
from
late
friday
afternoon
to
early
tuesday
morning.
he
was
brought
down
the
sheriff's
office
about
9:30
in
the
morning.
he
again
denied
as
the
record
shows
he
had
done
repeatedly
during
the
previous
questioning,
he
again
denied
any
implication
in
this
case
or
in
the
knowledge
of
his
wife's
death
and
he
repeated
to
the
sheriff's
officers
the
fact
that
he
had
been
mistreated
by
the
officers
during
the
other
interrogations
at
that
time.
they
did
mention
to
him
that
they
might
want
him
to
take
some
more
lie
detector
test,
since
he
had
been
subjected
to
seven
of
those
during
the
previous
interrogations.
he
had
been
confined
of
course
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
to
seven
polygraph
examinations
your
honor.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
referred
to
in
the
record
post
line
text.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
each
of
them.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
the
--
he
was
confined
during
that
interrogation
in
jail
and
the
city
jail
in
midland,
texas
in
the
department
of
public
safety
jail
which
was
outside
the
city
limits
of
that
city
and
was
confined
in
a
jail
in
borger,
texas,
300
miles
away
where
has
was
taken
during
the
first
five
days
of
interrogation.
on
tuesday
morning
as
i
mentioned
he
was
brought
down
at
9:30
by
two
deputy
sheriffs.
he
again
denied
his
guilt.
they
mentioned
to
him
that
he
might
be
subjected
or
would
he
be
interested
in
taking
some
more
polygraph
tests.
he
did
then
say
that
he
would
like
to
talk
to
somebody
before
talking
--
going
any
further
with
them
and
they
asked
him
who
and
he
said
he
like
to
talk
to
his
boss,
and
they
went
to
the
phone
and
came
back
and
said
there
was
no
answer.
the
deputy
sheriffs
then
bought
then
the
district
attorney
who
talked
to
him
and
thereafter
he
did
orally
confess
then
the
confession
he
was
later
reduced
to
writing,
i
think
all
of
the
procedure
there
prior
to
the
ten
that
the
old
confession
was
about
an
hour
and
15
minutes
according
to
the
record.
his
testimony
was
when
asked
about
this
third
confession,
they
went
and
got
mr.
mends
and
when
they
went
and
got
him,
“well
i
was
scared
because
i
could
see
it
looked
like
the
same
thing
happening
all
over
again,
that
three
or
four
days
of
abusing.”
this
is
at
page
153
of
the
record,
“and
i
was
scared
and
i
didn't
think
i
could
take
that
no
more,
and
so
i
just
went
on
and
gave
them
the
statement
because
i
had
already
made
two
statements
and
i
didn't
figure
it
made
any
difference
and
i
had
signed
two.”
certainly,
the
position
of
petitioner
here
is
that
the
taint
had
not
been
attenuated.
once
a
man
is
broken
in
and
the
opinions
of
this
court,
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
many
instances
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
when
a
man
is
broken
in
or
when
he
is
subjected
to
tactics
reminiscing
of
the
imposition
that
has
happened
in
many
cases
that
certainly
it
takes
a
long
time
to
repair
the
damages
done
that
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
would
certainly
support
our
contention
that
once
a
man
has
been
broken
that
he's
no
longer
a
whole
man
and
that
considering
the
type
of
coercive
tactics
that
are
employed
against
him
that
it
would
take
him
certainly
more
than
three
days
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
that
treatment.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
it
isn't
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
--
the
state
hasn't
been
conceding
that.
we
are
saying
that
we
believe
that
the
facts
establish
it.
we
think
that
they
used
every
coercive
tactic
they
could
think
of
in
order
to
try
to
get
a
confession
out
of
this
man.
the
officers
did
admit
on
many
occasions
that
they
were
trying
to
get
a
confession
out
of
him.
that's
shown
in
the
record
from
the
testimony
of
the
various
officers
that
they
were
trying
to
get
him
to
tell
the
truth,
that
they
told
him
he
ought
to
make
a
statement
and
things
like
this.
i
think
that
it
is
conceded
certainly
by
the
state
and
by
the
testimony
of
their
officers
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
interrogation
and
of
all
the
tactics
employed
by
the
police
during
the
course
of
it
was
to
get
a
confession.
that
much
is
conceded
in
the
record.
we
have,
of
course
in
search
of
the
cases
of
this
court
for
examples
when
more
than
one
confession
has
been
considered
by
the
court,
only
however,
i
believe
in
this
case
does
the
proposition
come
up
where
they
did
not
use
but
the
third
confession,
and
this
was
the
only
confession
which
the
state
attempted
to
use.
the
others
were
brought
into
evidence
by
the
petitioner
for
a
simple
reason
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
try
to
demonstrate
the
inconsistency
of
those
statements.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
we
never
got
those
first
two
confessions.
we
made
a
motion
at
the
beginning
or
just
part
of
the
jury
selection
actually
for
the
state
to
produce
the
confessions
for
our
examination
and
the
trial
court
denied
that
request.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
the
discussion
on
that
motion
and
actually
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
and
they
accepted
the
position
of
being
denied,
that
was
made.
then
of
course,
we
did
thereafter
filed
a
motion
to
exclude
the
use
of
any
of
the
confessions
and
we
went
into
--
we
then
request
in
that
the
state
be
required
to
produce
them
for
examination
by
the
trial
judge
in
connection
with
our
motion.
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
which
we
are
urging
the
court,
urging
upon
the
court
as
the
ground
for
reversal
in
this
case
that
the
rules
certainly
which
now
are
applicable
in
all
federal
cases
that
require
the
granting
of
a
motion
for
discovery
and
provide
explicitly
that
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
see
and
examine
and
use
his
own
statements
should
be
extended
to
the
trials
in
criminal
cases
as
well
as
in
civil
cases.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
as
we
mentioned,
number
one,
and
we
have
stated
in
our
motion,
to
demonstrate
the
inconsistency
of
the
three
statements.
we
of
course
had
information
that
the
first
statement
said
that
–
first
confession
that
petitioner
signed
said
that
he
shot
her,
that
the
second
confession
deviated
in
other
respects
and
also
said
that
he
had
choked
her
with
a
belt.
we
of
course
have
contended
that
the
main
reason
that
these
are
the
two
confessions
were
taken
is
after
they
got
the
first
one
and
they
testified
to
this
said
that
he
had
shot
her
that
of
course
they
found
no
evidence
that
these
bones
it
was
completely
deteriorated.
no
evidence,
no
bullet,
no
evidence
of
being
shot
but
there
was
a
belt
around
the
neck,
and
--
so
we
felt
that
we
needed
to
demonstrate
this
to
the
jury
as
a
ground
of
--
as
a
means
of
demonstrating
a
coercion
which
had
been
practiced
upon
him.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
yes.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well
no.
actually,
it
was
before
testimony
was
begun
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
--
in
the
case
and
the
motion
to
exclude
and
suppress
the
confessions
which
is
what
we're
talking,
was
after
or
nearly
a
based
testimony.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
it
was
argued
as
they
begun
to
introduce
it
which
was
the
trial
and
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
--
in
about
a
day,
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
actually
we
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
we
argued
this
motion
which
confession
or
what
confessions
are
we
going
to
introduce
but
we
did
want
to
get
the
jury
out
of
the
room
before
we
went
into
that
and
it
was
a
motion
to
exclude
them
all
three.
and
in
connection
with
that
we
did
argue
that
yes,
they
should
be
produced
certainly
for
the
trial
court's
examination,
although
he
had
already
refused
our
request
to
have
them
made
available
to
us
before
that.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that's
correct,
yes.
the
questions
here
of
course
are
those
which
this
court
has
considered
many
times
before.
we
certainly
think
for
instance
and
have
urged
we
believe
that
the
failure
to
take
this
man
before
a
magistrate
when
he
was
first
arrested
was
a
very
vital
step
in
the
proceedings.
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
officer
admits
that
he
had
no
grounds
for
his
arrest.
here
we
have
a
case
where
certainly
one
other
law
enforcement
agency
knowing
that
there
was
no
ground
for
holding
him
had
sent
him
on
his
way
and
told
him
to
come
back
later
would
certainly
had
acted
within
the
law.
that
if
he
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
certainly
if
he
had
competent
counsel
which
he
did
not
have
at
the
time
of
these
proceedings,
if
he
had
had
competent
counsel
then
he
would
have
i
think
been
discharged
because
there
was
no
evidence
against
him
other
than
these
confessions
and
we
think
that
the
coercion
which
is
demonstrated
would
easily
have
been
shown.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
that
we're
arguing
about
taking
him
before
a
magistrate
mr.
justice
black
in
context
with
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
where
it
has
been
held
as
a
coercive
--
that
failure
to
do
so
has
been
held
to
be
a
coercive
circumstance.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
that
state
law
article
217
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
requires
that
when
a
person
is
arrested,
he
must
immediately
and
not
as
soon
as
convenient
as
in
the
federal
cases
but
he
must
immediately
be
taken
before
a
magistrate.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
for
the
purpose
of
examining
him
to
the
offense
among
others.
the
statute
itself
your
honor,
there
are
several
articles
which
cover
it
but
he
is
--
when
the
accused
has
been,
for
instance
article
245,
when
the
accused
has
been
brought
before
a
magistrate,
that
officer
shall
proceed
to
examine
and
to
the
truth
of
the
accusation
made
allowing
the
accused
however
sufficient
time
to
procure
counsel.
then
the
other
statutes
provide
that
the
same
rules
on
trials
prevail
in
hearings
before
the
magistrate
that
to
direct
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
it
--
it's
a
matter
of
commitment
to
bail,
that's
very
true.
but
of
course,
this
court
has
considered
this
in
pointer
versus
texas
and
has
withheld
i
think
the
questions
as
to
whether
it
is
such
a
vital
step
in
the
proceedings
against
the
defendant
as
to
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process
if
they
do
not
take
it.
we
have
urged
that
it
is
and
that
certainly
this
is
a
case
which
demonstrates
that
had
this
petitioner
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
counsel
had
been
procured
for
under
the
law
or
even
advised
as
we
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
he
was
even
understood
that
he
could
have
counsel
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
there
was
in
fact
apparently
no
hearing
whatever
before
the
magistrate,
certainly
nothing
was
introduced
in
evidence
at
that
hearing.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
he
had
already
confessed
your
honor
just
a
few
probably
less
than
an
hour
before.
there
is
evidence
of
course
that
petitioner
was
sick
at
the
time,
right
after
the
first
confession
and
that
he
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
it's
not
in
dispute.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
from
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
officers
who
testified
that
he
was
sick
and
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that
he
was
sick
and
had
some
trouble,
that
he
vomited
and
that
was
after
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
he
claims
that
he
was
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that
is
in
dispute,
yes.
the
officers
have
denied
that
they
did
inflict
any
physical
damage,
but
they
have
admitted
that
this
petitioner
had
nothing
to
eat
on
sunday
morning
until
late
monday
afternoon
when
he
was
given
the
milk
at
the
time
he
signed
the
first
confession.
they
also
even
admitted
that
on
the
second
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
say
he
was.
he
denies
it.
our
contention
of
course
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
mr.
justice
white
our
position
throughout
this
case
of
course
has
been
that
if
it
is
a
consideration
as
to
the
physical
state
of
a
defendant
who
is
being
held
and
interrogated
that
if
that
is
the
ultimate
question
and
if
we
are
as
they
said
understand
the
way
the
circumstances,
the
coercion
against
his
particular
circumstances
and
ability
to
resist
that
then
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
--
whether
he
was
offered
anything
to
eat
or
not.
the
question
is
what
was
his
actual
physical
condition?
this
has
been
our
argument
and
our
position.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well
this
question
whether
they're
going
to
believe
the
defendant
or
whether
they
are
going
to
believe
the
officers
i
suppose
if
that's
what
it
comes
into.
i
think,
i
believe
that
it
gets
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
that's
what
i
said.
i
don't
know
anything
else
to
say
with
that.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes,
the
evidence
was
given
to
the
jury,
and
jury
was
charged,
your
honor.
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
is
remaining
of
my
time.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
just
one
or
two
things
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
i
believe
that
the
record
does
show
beyond
the
question
that
this
petitioner
was
questioned
on
tuesday
not
for
any
great
length
of
time
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
officers
at
least.
but
they
do
admit
the
questioning
him
on
two
occasions.
he
says
that
he
was
questioned
on
tuesday
and
on
tuesday
night.
and
on
wednesday
then
he
was
taking
on
this
300-mile
round
trip.
along,
i
mean
in
connection
with
this
idea
foods
which
has
been
discussed.
i
think
if
--
he
was
offered
food
they
say,
the
officers
say.
he
denies
that
he
was
offered
any
food
at
all.
his
sister
substantiates
at
least
that
he
was
not
offered
any
food
on
sunday.
but
certainly
on
the
days
that
were
important
to
the
confessions
that
is
sunday
and
monday
and
wednesday
and
thursday.
he
didn't
eat
anything.
he
didn't
have
anything
to
eat
except
from
sunday
morning
to
monday
night,
one
coca
cola,
on
wednesday
when
they
took
him
to
borger,
one
cartoon
of
milk.
on
thursday,
nothing
all
day
long,
now
these
were
the
times
which
of
course
are
pertinent
and
of
course
the
first
two
confessions
were
concerned.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
your
honor
on
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
all
three
of
them
be
produced,
yes.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
now
this
is
shown
on
the
record.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
we
did
move
to
exclude
all
three
confessions.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no,
no,
at
this
point
that
we
talked
about.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
and
there's
a
colloquy
in
the
record
that
at
the
time
this
was
done
concerning
the
admissibility
or
concerning
the
productions
of
all
of
these
statements.
i
believed
that
my
adversary
has
mentioned
here
that
perhaps
we
have
waived
some
rights,
but
i
do
quote
from
--
to
you.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
don't
know
exactly
where
it
was,
i
can't
think.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
your
honor
that
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
that
appears
to
be
the
contention
and
frankly
i
don't
know
of
any
appropriate
way
to
do
it.
i
guess
to
converse
the
state
as
i
understand
it
says
that
anytime
they
offer
a
confession
or
a
statement
in
the
evidence
that
then
at
that
point
you
can
demand
to
see
it
and
again.
now
at
the
time
that
we
demanded
to
see
it
here
and
moved
for
the
exclusion
of
all
three
statements,
admittedly
we
didn't
know
where
they're
going
to
try
to
introduce
all
three
of
them
or
just
one
of
them.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
introduced
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no.
they
never
did
offer
to
introduce
all
other
of
them
and
refused
to
produce
the
first
two.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir,
only
the
third.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
didn't.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well,
they
didn't
offer
to,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
they
never
did
offer
to
produce
the
first
two.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well,
introduce.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
just
one,
the
third
one.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
the
third
one.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
fortas
in
connection
with
this
question
which
you
asked
if
i
may
answer,
the
colloquy
here
begins
on
page
87,
it
extends
to
two,
three
pages
in
connection
with
this
motion.
now,
the
prosecution
of
course
had
said
that
on
page
90,
“no
sir
your
honor,
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
confessions
at
all.
and
this
motion
is
no
good
as
it
is
right
now.
he's
not
entitled
--
he's
not
anymore
entitled
to
the
confessions
now
than
was
a
week
ago.”
whereupon
i
said
“i'm
not
asking
for
the
confessions.
i've
told
you
that
i
don't
even
care
to
see
them.”
well
now
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
had
already
been
told
that
we
weren't
going
to
see
it.
and
our
motion
had
been
denied
just
a
few
hours
before
when
we
asked
the
state
to
produce
them,
but
we
did
ask
that
they
be
produced
for
the
court
to
look
at
them
in
connection
with
this
second
motion
to
exclude
all
of
them
which
we
were
at
that
time
offered.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no
sir.
i
think
it
--
on
page
91
we
have
in
the
middle
of
the
page
over
here
i
think
is
where
we
prior
to
say
this
as
well
as
on
page
91
or
90
where
we
did
say
that
the
court
has
got
the
right
to
look
at
it
and
we
were
asking
that
they
be
produced
for
the
court
to
examine
in
camera.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
and
at
that
particular
hearing
that
is
more
or
less
true.
we'd
already
been
told
we
weren't
going
to
see
it.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
sir?
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
well
mr.
justice
black
if
i
did
say
that
and
i
know
i
did
not.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
did,
it
said
that
at
that
point
we
were
arguing
the
second
motion
now
which
was
an
independent
motion
and
we
had
already
been
denied
the
right
to
see
them.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
said
that
we
don't
want
to
see
them
right
now
but
we
do
want
the
judge
to
see
it.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
no.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
don't
think
if
they
--
but
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir,
i
did
and
in
effect
i
say
that
at
that
point
we
didn't
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
to
look
at
it.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
yes
sir.
this
is
what
we
were
trying
to
say.
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i
did
say
that
your
honor.
i
said
i
am
not
asking
--
mr.
reagan
h.
legg
i'm
not
asking
for
the
confessions,
i
have
told
you
that
i
don't
even
care
to
see
them.
i
want
to
tell
you
that
these
confessions
entered
inadmissible.
the
court
has
got
the
right
to
look
at
them
at
anytime
he
wants
to
and
can
and
connection
with
this

mr.
reagan
h.

yes
sir,
well
that
particular
conversation,
yes.
mr.
reagan
h.

yes
sir.
mr.
reagan

thank
you.
