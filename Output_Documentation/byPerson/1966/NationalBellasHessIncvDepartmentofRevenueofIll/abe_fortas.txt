it's
still
pretty
big.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry.
as
i
understand
it,
this
case
does
possibly
in
a
way
involve
a
distinction
between
sporadic
and
limited
mailings
and
a
regular
course
of
periodic
mailings
plus
occasional
mailings,
but
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
for
example
that
i
suppose
this
case
would
might
be
different
from
situation
in
which
a
department
store,
let's
say,
in
new
york
city
sells
by
mail
to
some
extent,
x-extent
whatever
it
may
be,
to
costumers
in
new
jersey
or
connecticut
or
the
district.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
the
burden
any
worse
than
it
is
on
in-state
sellers?
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
had
stores
there.
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
have
to
do
that
if
you
had
stores
there.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
next
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
what
kind
of
tax
would
that
be?
justice
abe
fortas
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
is
that
i
thought
that
the
vendor
state
did
not
collect
those
taxes.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
this
is
pretty
theoretical,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
interested
in
the
--
the
brief
to
which
you
would
apply
your
statute.
i
hope
you'll
come
to
that.
for
example,
let's
suppose
that
macy's
had
a
hundred
costumers
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
that
--
that
macy's
imposed
advertising
literature,
catalogues,
as
they
usually
do
i
gather
in
their
bills
that
were
sent
to
these
costumers
every
month.
justice
abe
fortas
would
your
statute
cover
that,
and
i
hope
you'll
come
to
that
kind
of
problem
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
this
bothers
me
that
suppose
macy's
had
only
one
costumer
in
illinois
and
that
costumer
have
been
to
new
york
and
had
opened
a
charge
account
at
macy's.
and
then
thereafter
macy's
sent
monthly
bills
and
said
“we're
going
to
have
a
light
sale
and
we
offer
you
bed
linen
at
a
bargain.”
and
then
the
costumer
responds
to
that
advertising
and
buys
a
bed
linen.
is
that
enough
to
subject
macy's
to
the
duty
of
collecting
a
used
tax?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
their
statute
says
engaging
in
soliciting
orders.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i'm
asking
you
in
effect
whether
illinois
makes
a
distinction
between
an
occasional
solicitation
as
in
the
cases
that
i
put
to
you,
or
a
regular
solicitation
but
limited
in
quantity.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
this
kind
of
thing
where
you
have
a
sort
of
a
broad
side
solicitation
through
mail
order
catalogues
and
flyers
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
it
is
that
while
the
language
of
your
statute
is
very
broad,
you
say
that
that's
your
position,
that
you
recognize
that
there
are
limits
as
a
constitutional
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
limits
would
depend
upon
the
volume
and
the
frequency,
what
are
the
factors?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
it's
both.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
still
pretty
big.
