justice
potter
stewart
to
refresh
my
unclear
recollection,
was
the
miller
case
a
used
tax
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
decided
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
of
commerce,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
2%
applied
across
the
board
to
the
use
tax
and
the
sales
tax
and
applies
equally
to
local
retailer?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
insofar
as
there
is
any
disparity
between
the
local
people
and
this
appellant,
though
the
disparities
continue
because
each
--
each
is
treat
--
treated
equally
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
net
disparities
if
any,
continues?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
continuing
a
thought
suggested
by
my
brother
fortas.
i
--
i
suppose
in
your
illinois
newspapers
in
--
on
sunday,
the
book
of
the
month
club
advertisers
that
puts
a
little
coupon
in
there
to
send
in?
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
--
this
would
cover
--
your
statute
would
cover
that
one?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
every
sunday
--
every
sunday
throughout
the
year
in
every
--
in
every
chicago
tribune
sunday
paper.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
--
the
statute
is,
i
think
you've
already
said
makes
such
no
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
it.
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
that
--
for
that
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
distinction
is
to
be
found
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
statute
is
quite
broad.
i
think
the
distinction
is
to
be
found
in
an
interpretation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
interpreting
what
is
required
for
the
nexus
or
the
minimum
content
requirement.
i
think
that
is
the
issue
and
i
suggest
that
it
should
be
addressed
in
this
case
to
the
particular
circumstances
to
this
case
and
not
to
circumstances
that
as
they
might
be
in
a
subsequent
case
or
in
another
case.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that's
a
matter
of
substance
and
not
form?
which
way
does
that
cut
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well
do
you
think
its
substance
and
not
form
or
form
and
not
substance.
i
misunderstood
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
now
which
is
this
distinction
between
common
carriers
and
their
own
type?
justice
potter
stewart
form
but
not
substance.
