mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
appears
little
dispute
as
to
the
issue
of
the
case
whether
within
the
limitations
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
illinois
may
now
require
national
bellas
hess
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
collect
and
remit
its
used
tax.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
--
this
particular
issue
turns
upon
first
the
illinois
statute
and
secondly
and
most
importantly
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
i
would
now
like
to
address
myself
briefly
first
to
the
--
excuse
me,
the
statute
and
secondly
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
uniquely,
national's
argument
does
not
address
itself
to
the
illinois
statute,
the
one
now
before
this
court,
rather
they
suggest
false
statutes
of
other
states
or
if
you
will,
states
in
general.
they
point
out
thus
the
report
to
which
they
refer,
the
house
report,
they
point
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
unanimity
in
state
statutes,
and
with
this
we
agree.
and
they
further
premise
upon
this
fact
the
conclusion
that
due
to
a
lack
of
unanimity
there
are
certain
unfairnesses
which
result
in
state
taxation.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
if
the
unfairnesses
to
which
they
allude
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
illinois
statute.
as
the
statutes
of
many
cases
which
from
time
to
time
this
court
has
considered,
illinois
provides
both
a
sales
and
a
used
tax.
these
are
intended
to,
and
i
suggest
do
compliment
one
another.
the
sales
tax
applies
to
transactions
within
the
state
and
conversely
the
used
tax
applies
to
interstate
transactions
such
as
the
instant
transaction.
both
are
measured
at
3.5%
in
the
state
of
illinois.
counsel
has
adequately
mentioned
the
recent
1961
catalogue
provision
statute
which
was
enacted
by
illinois.
i
might
answer
in
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
how
many
states
do
have
that,
actually
its
21
states
now.
at
the
time
this
particular
report
was
prepared
there
was
12
states.
now
there
are
21.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
agree
with
the
court.
the
only
reference
i
would
have
would
be
the
comments
and
the
report
with
which
i
would
agree.
the
report
observes
that
the
large
ones
that
have
retail
stores
within
the
state
i.e.
sears
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no,
not
until
recently
your
honor,
not
until
recently,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
definitely,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
suggest
the
case
not
yet
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
mr.
justice
black,
it
does.
specifically
section
439.9
of
the
illinois
statute
specifically
provides
an
administration
expense
rebate.
this
is
2%
of
the
amount
of
tax
collected.
in
other
words,
the
retailer
collecting
the
tax
for
the
state
of
illinois
may
withhold
to
defray
his
administration
expenses
2%
of
the
tax
collected.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
don't
know.
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
one.
now
the
report
to
which
national
in
its
brief
allude
makes
the
argument
that
this
is
one
of
the
unfairnesses
in
state
taxation,
but
as
i'm
now
arguing
i
do
not
think
it's
an
unfairness
consonant
wit
the
illinois
statute.
i
think
the
illinois
statute
before
your
honors,
this
is
in
the
forefront
of
the
state
and
used
taxation.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
mr.
justice
black
i
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
significant.
there
is
another
point
provided
by
the
illinois
statute
which
i
do
think
might
be
significant
to
this
court,
but
not
that
one.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
why
i
--
yes,
as
an
answer
to
your
question,
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
have
to,
as
illinois
does,
pay
them
to
be
the
tax
collector.
of
course,
you
premise
your
question
in
the
fact
that
they
are
not
doing
business
in
the
state.
my
argument
would
be
that
national
in
the
posture
of
this
case
is
definitely
doing
business.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
it
depends
upon
the
particular
fact
circumstances
of
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
it
applies
because
i
--
all
of
the
provisions
of
our
taxes
as
a
matter
fact
are
--
the
tax
specifically
states
that
all
of
the
provisions
of
our
sales
tax
apply
equally
to
the
used
tax,
and
those
on
further
provides
that
where
a
sales
tax
cannot
be
collected
under
the
similar
circumstances,
a
used
tax
cannot
be
collected.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
each
is
treated
equally,
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
right.
the
one
other
additional
section
of
the
illinois
statute
to
which
i
would
like
to
briefly
allude
is
section
439.3,
i
needless
to
say,
when
i
read
it,
i'd
like
to
paraphrase
the
pertinent
part
of
that
statute.
the
statute
specifically
expresses
an
intention
to
avoid
multi-state
taxation,
and
in
so
doing,
subsection
(c)
of
the
illinois
statute
provides
that
where
--
if
there
is
an
interstate
transaction,
such
as
we
have
here,
if
a
tax
is
paid
in
the
state
of
origin,
the
vendor's
home
state,
there
is
a
corresponding
offset
credit
in
the
state
of
illinois.
thus
it
follows
that
if
there
is
a
tax
paid
in
missouri
on
this
transaction,
for
the
extent
the
tax
is
paid
in
missouri
no
tax
need
be
paid
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
probably
it
would
be
a
sales
tax
in
missouri.
as
i
will
later
point
out
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
report
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
missouri
or
the
vendor
state
do
not
collect
the
tax,
but
assuming
that
they
did
collect
the
tax,
there
would
be
an
of
--
or
credit
against
that
tax
in
illinois.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
they
do
not,
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
it's
theoretical
under
the
posture
of
this
case
definitely.
i
--
i
point
to
this
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
this
and
also
to
the
provision
for
an
administrative
credit
merely
to
demonstrate
that
i
think
the
illinois
tax
in
question
here
is
imminently
fair
and
definitely
treats
intrastate
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
in
both
a
fair
and
identical
manner.
mr.
cox
says
in
the
main,
fairly
if
not
quite
fully
related
the
facts
of
the
case
to
the
court.
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
add
a
few
additional
facts,
more
importantly
clarify
a
few
misconceptions
which
have
been
raised
by
the
reply
brief,
and
in
general
present
to
the
court
in
something
of
a
chronological
but
brief
fashion
the
facts
of
the
case
as
they
relate
to
the
issue,
namely
what
in-state
connection
does
this
appellant,
national
bellas
hess
have
to
the
state
of
illinois.
as
indicated
by
mr.
cox,
national
bellas
hess
twice
yearly
sends
into
illinois
two
major
catalogues.
these
catalogues
contain
approximately,
each
catalogue,
approximately
4000
items
of
merchandise.
they
are
sent
into
illinois
with
the
obvious
purpose
of
soliciting
sales
in
illinois.
in
addition
to
these
catalogues,
national
sends
in
to
illinois
sales
books
and
flyers.
now
in
this
point
there
appears
to
be
some
dispute
as
to
the
record.
in
the
reply
brief,
page
3
of
national's
reply
brief
on
footnote
2,
they
seem
to
take
some
offense
that
our
statement
of
the
record
and
claimed
that
we
have
misstated
the
record
by
intimating
that
some
advertising
was
done
other
than
by
catalogue.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
record
supports
the
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
now
in
oral
argument
mr.
cox
did
allude
to
the
fact
that
sales
books
or
flyers
were
sent.
i
suggest
that
the
record
is
replete
the
answer
on
pages
54,
55
and
58
of
the
brief.
affidavits
by
two
of
its
vice
presidents,
by
national's
vice
presidents,
contained
at
pages
68,
69
and
70,
pages
32
and
33,
referred
to
catalogues,
sales
books
and
flyers.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
go
on
to
distinguish
as
i
would
now
that
the
sales
books
and
flyers
in
addition
to
being
sent
to
costumers
are
sent
to
addresses
with
addressees
designated
merely
as
“occupant”.
the
record
further
indicates
that
these
sales
books
or
flyers
are
usually
included
with
merchandise
sent
into
the
state.
i
think
this
bears
particular
significance
here.
national,
in
the
posture
of
this
case
had
an
excess
of
$2
million
in
sales
in
a
period
of
approximately
15
to
15
and
one
half
months.
now
our
brief
mentions
14
months
which
is
incorrect.
it
would
properly
be
a
period
of
about
15
to
15
and
one
half
months.
their
sales
exceeded
$2
million.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
illinois,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
accepting
this
then,
if
the
usual
practice
was
to
include
sales
flyers
in
their
merchandise,
over
200,000
items
came
into
illinois
which
usually
contain
sales
flyers
or
sales
books
as
they
would
call
them.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i'll
answer
it
if
i
may
now
mr.
justice
fortas.
yes,
the
terms
of
the
statute
would
definitely
cover
that
particular
transaction.
the
statute
is
quite
broad
and
would
--
it
mentions
advertising
per
se.
in
this
regard,
i
might
indicate
that
the
statute
here
is
identical
not
quite
in
le
–
legal
in
total
terms,
but
definitely
in
legal
terms
for
the
statute
before
this
court
in
the
scripto
case,
scripto
versus
carson.
this
particular
statute,
the
illinois
statute
is
identical,
so
the
court
has
had
before
a
statute
identical
in
terms
of
the
illinois
statute
in
the
scripto
case.
for
that
matter
in
the
scripto
case,
this
court
footnoted
and
spelled
out
the
statute,
the
florida
statute
in
scripto
in
the
margin.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
we
--
we
had
independent
con
--
we
have
ten
independent
contractors
in
the
scripto
case.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
pardon
me?
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
it
was
not
this
case.
the
distinction
in
scripto,
mr.
justice
harlan
was
that
there
were
ten
independent
contractors
or
specialty
brokers.
here,
in
lieu,
there
are
--
we
have
the
catalogues.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
think
the
issues
then
would
be
one
resolved
by
the
courts
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
issue
as
i
will,
in
stating
my
suggestion
as
to
the
law
to
be
distilled
in
this
field,
will
turn
on
the
continuous
and
substantial
nature
of
the
business.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
direct
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
illinois
statute
does
not
make
the
distinction.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
it
does,
but
that
is
the
issue
of
the
amici
brief
raised,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
our
statute
would
cover
it.
i
am
not
presenting
to
this
court
and
i
would
make
this
distinction
that
the
--
those
particular
facts
would
satisfy
the
scrutiny
of
the
court
under
a
due
process
argument.
i
am
however,
and
i
make
this
point
quite
strongly
suggesting
that
the
court
has
before
it,
the
statute
is
identical
to
the
statute
in
scripto.
the
court
has
before
it
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
which
i
would
like
my
particular
emphasis
to
go
on.
we
do
not
have
a
macy
situation
as
mr.
justice
fortas
would
suggest,
nor
do
we
have
one
of
these
--
what
i
would
term
the
occasional
type
of
advertising.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
think
again
that
the
issue
would
turn
not
only
on
the
advertising
itself
but
on
the
business
wrote
by
the
advertising.
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
--
nor
did
the
statute
in
scripto
which
this
court
put
in
the
footnote.
that
definitely
the
statute
makes
no
distinction.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes,
that
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes.
question
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
definitely
would
not
tolerate
and
i
doubt
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
would.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
i
would
definitely
would
not
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
the
results
bear
most
importantly
not
the
method
of
advertising
but
rather
the
results.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
definitely
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
oh!
definitely,
i
think
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
rule
that
they
should
understand
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
the
rule
that
i
will
suggest
should
be
distilled
from
the
cases
of
this
court
is
the
rule
which
businessmen
should
well
understand.
and
that
is
simply
that
where
a
business
is
in
successfully
in
a
state
from
a
business
point
of
view
that
that
should
be
equated
with
presence
in
a
legal
--
from
a
legal
point
of
view.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
think
that
that
is
the
rule
that
the
case
should
disclose
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
correct.
i
think
that
the
form,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
most
notably
the
recent
scripto
decision
definitely
indicate
that
formal
distinction
should
not
be
given
o
--
overemphasis
but
rather
matters
of
substance
should
be
considered.
we
should
look
to
the
business
success
of
the
particular
business
in
the
state
and
not
to
the
formal
arrangements
which
it
enjoins
in
the
states.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
what
are
the
factors
as
the
limits
upon
which
they
would
depend?
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
principle
to
be
distilled
from
all
of
these
cases,
the
nexus
cases,
are
first
that
stress
should
be
played
on
substance
and
not
form.
that
secondly,
continual
and
systematic
activity
should
be
distinguished
from
occasional
or
casual
activities.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
what
is
substance
and
not
form
--
i
might
give
an
example,
yes.
the
use
of
common
carriers
as
opposed
to
the
use
of
their
own
trucks
within
the
state,
i
would
think
that
this
is
the
matter
of
substance
in
that
form.
the
--
thirdly
i
think
that
the
method
of
solicitation
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
legal
distinction
between
the
use
of
a
common
carrier
within
the
state.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
that
substance
should
take
proper
than
the
form.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
other
words,
i
am
--
i'm
suggesting
that
the
fact
or
the
distinction
that
you
would
make
would
be
a
formal
distinction
between
a
common
carrier
on
the
one
hand
and
a
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
--
your
own
trucks,
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
not
in
law.
i'm
making
the
distinction
in
answer
to
the
questions,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
thirdly,
i
think
that
the
method
of
solicitation
matters
not
so
long
as
the
--
it
does
not
bear
upon
the
in-state
efficiency
of
the
business.
and
i
think
that
this
is
definitely
a
principle
we
can
take
from
the
scripto
case.
and
finally,
i
think
that
as
i've
already
alluded,
successful
presence
in
an
economic
sense
should
be
equated
with
sufficient
presence
in
a
legal
sense.
and
this,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
suggest
would
be
a
--
a
fine
rule
and
then
--
the
best
workable
rule
for
the
businessman.
it's
something
he
fully
and
well
understands.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
that
i
think
would
depend
a
great
deal
on
the
--
this
particular
court.
i
definitely
think
that
$2
million
of
business,
in
excess
of
$2
million
of
business,
in
a
period
approximating
15
and
a
half
months,
any
businessman
would
agree
was
economic
success
within
the
state
of
illinois.
i
might
make
another
point
here.
there
were
in-state
cod
deliveries.
again
there
seems
to
be
some
question
raised
in
the
reply
brief
as
to
the
propriety
of
our
mentioning
in
cod
collections
within
the
state.
the
record,
i
think,
bears
us
out
the
quote
that
counsel
mentions.
they
quote
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
8
and
footnote
3.
they
set
out
a
quote
wherein
we
suggest
cod
collections
were
made.
they
--
in
setting
forth
our
quote,
by
the
way
that
is
page
--
there's
typographical
or
a
printing
error
there.
that
is
page
15
of
our
brief
not
page
17.
in
setting
out
that
quote,
i
think
in
fairness
they
might
have
set
forth
a
footnote
which
immediately
followed
that
quote.
and
then
the
footnote
we
correctly,
in
accordance
with
the
record,
indicated
that
cod
collections
were
not
the
--
the
practice
in
all
cases.unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
indicate
in
what
and
how
many
instances
cod
collections
were
made.
however,
the
fact
remains
that
cod
collections
were
made
in
illinois.
in
the
same
footnote,
they
seem
to
take
issue
or
object
to
our
reference
to
the
--
or
common
carriers
or
the
postal
authorities
as
their
representatives
or
as
their
bill
collectors.
now,
i
think
two
particular
statements
by
this
court
might
bear
upon
this
and
again
this
goes
to
the
substance
over
form
argument
which
i
would
now
make
to
the
court.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
writing
in
the
harvester
case
indicated
in
a
similar
type
of
case
that
--
in
these
cir
--
circumstances,
we
are
dealing
with
matters
of
substance
and
not
with
matters
of
dialectics.
and
further,
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
writing
for
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
most
recent
scripto
case
said
“to
permit
such
formal
contractualships
to
make
a
constitutional
difference
would
open
the
gates
to
a
stampede
of
tax
avoidance.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
what,
the
volume?
the
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
--
i
do
not
know
the
exact
answer
to
that
your
honor.
what
--
what
percentage
of
total
revenue
this
would
mean
to
the
state
i
do
not
know.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
the
problem
is
not
a
question,
if
i
may
pause
in
an
answer
to
you
question
mr.
justice.
however,
the
problem
here
is
not
a
question
of
revenue
to
the
state
of
illinois.here
is
the
problem.
i
think
that
the
defendant,
national
bellas
hess,
is
somewhat
ill
characterized
its
position
in
this
court.
they're
suggesting
to
the
court
that
there
is
small
specialty
type
mail
order
house,
one
who
wants
to
eliminate
discrimination,
one
who
wants
nothing
more
than
equality
of
tax
treatment.
i
don't
think
that
the
record
in
this
case
your
honors
or
more
importantly
this
report,
the
state
taxation
report
which
they
rely
upon,
bears
this
particular
status
out
for
them.
if
i
might
point
to
this,
they
make
a
great
to
do
about
the
fact
that
in
most
states,
collection
has
not
or
is
not
made
from
cir
--
in
circumstances
such
as
this.
in
other
words,
most
states
do
not
require
an
out-of-state
vendor
to
make
a
collection
of
its
used
tax.
they
make
a
great
to
do
about
this
fact.
now,
this
is
--
this
is
true.
there's
no
question
about
this.
we're
--
we're
willing
to
admit
it.
only
recently,
illinois
has
enacted
a
statute.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
illinois
or
other
states
have
not
collected
this
tax
in
the
past
bears
one
iota
on
the
constitutional
issue
before
this
court.
however,
and
this
would
be
the
point
i
would
make,
i
think
the
reason
states
have
recently
enacted
this
legislation
does
bear
upon
the
policy
considerations
and
does
portray
national
in
a
little
different
light.
and
i
might
explain
this.
the
record
is
also
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
vendor
states
do
not
require
collection
of
this
tax.
appreciating
this
fact,
it
becomes
rather
obvious
that
national
bellas
hess
or
these
mail
order
houses
are
now
in
a
tax
sanctuary
situation
they're
not
paying
any
tax.
and
not
paying
any
tax
to
permit
it,
to
discriminate
in
a
way
against
the
local
buyers
and
also
against
the
mail
order
houses
who
do
pay
the
tax.
this
i
think
is
a
--
an
important
point
in
understanding
the
policy
and
the
reason
for
this
tax.
this
tax
is
not
intended
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
buyers.
the
purpose
of
this
tax
is
to
have
everyone
treated
equally,
to
permit
the
in-state
seller
the
same
margin
of
profit
that
the
out-of-state
seller
would
have.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
if
you're
asking
me
mr.
justice
white,
do
i
think
that
this
particular
bill
will
pass?
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
oh!
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
definitely.
i
think
it's
intended
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no,
it's
definitely
not
to
raise
revenue.
the
idea
is
to
protect,
if
you
will,
not
only
the
local
merchants
but
the
intrastate
merchants
who
are
collecting
and
remitting
the
illinois
tax.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
the
statute
was
passed
in
july
1,
1961.
the
particular
tax
in
question
ran
from
july
17,
1961
to
october
31,
1962.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
july
1,
1961.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
we're
precluded
from
collecting
a
tax
--
a
sales
tax
by
this
court's
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
--decision
in
the
mcleod
case.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
the
mcleod
case
indicated
that
the
sale
would
have
to
be
within
the
state
which
would
have
been
definitely
not.
we
make
no
argument
to
the
sale
as
within
the
state.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well,
this
is
the
court's
decision
in
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
mis
--
the
late
mr.
justice
wiley
rutledge
wrote
a
vigorous
dissent
in
mcleod,
if
i
could
possibly
pair
his
phrases.
he
did
not
agree
that
in
mcleod
a
tax
should
not
be
collected
and
it
should
not
border
upon
the
semantics
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
sales
or
used
tax.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
i
--
i
think
that
or
more
properly,
the
right
to
collecting
a
used
tax,
and
this
is
the
reason
we
collect
the
used
tax.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
we
do.
i
like
for
a
moment
to
turn
in
conclusion
to
the
cases
real
briefly.
national
places
tremendous
reliance
upon
the
miller
case
and
i
think
that
this
reliance
is
somewhat
misplaced,
and
i
think
it's
somewhat
misplaced
because
national's
failed
to
appreciate
the
particular
facts
in
miller.
i'd
like
to
briefly
mention
some
five
distinctions
in
miller
which
i
think
sufficiently
distinguish
miller
from
this
case.
first
of
all,
national
in
its
brief
and
now
again
in
its
oral
argument
refers
to
the
regular
deliveries
in
miller.
conversely,
the
court
in
deciding
miller
specifically
referred
to
these
deliveries
as
occasional
deliveries.
again,
mr.
justice
clark
in
writing
the
scripto
decision
referring
to
miller,
again
referred
to
the
“occasional
deliveries”
in
miller.
again,
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
3,
national
refers
to
the
regular
mailings
in
miller.
conversely,
this
court
in
deciding
miller
referred
to
the
occasional
sales
circulars
in
miller.
national
fails
to
make
a
distinction
which
is
i
think
quite
failing
in
miller,
and
that
is
that
in
the
miller
case
the
buyers
left
the
state
of
maryland,
went
in
to
the
state
of
delaware
and
at
the
vendor's
stores
made
the
purchase.
they
do
not
particularly
give
any
credence
to
this
fact.
however,
the
majority
of
the
court
in
writing
miller
specifically
noted
that
the
seller
in
the
miller
case
did
not
know
where
the
goods
were
to
be
used.
now
mr.
justice
douglas
in
writing
a
dissent
felt
otherwise
and
believed
that
the
seller
should've
known
where
they
were
used.
the
fact
remains
that
whether
or
not
he
did
or
did
not
know
was
pertinent.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
appears
little
dispute
as
to
the
issue
of
the
case
whether
within
the
limitations
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
illinois
may
now
require
national
bellas
hess
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
collect
and
remit
its
used
tax.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
--
this
particular
issue
turns
upon
first
the
illinois
statute
and
secondly
and
most
importantly
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
i
would
now
like
to
address
myself
briefly
first
to
the
--
excuse
me,
the
statute
and
secondly
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
uniquely,
national's
argument
does
not
address
itself
to
the
illinois
statute,
the
one
now
before
this
court,
rather
they
suggest
false
statutes
of
other
states
or
if
you
will,
states
in
general.
they
point
out
thus
the
report
to
which
they
refer,
the
house
report,
they
point
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
unanimity
in
state
statutes,
and
with
this
we
agree.
and
they
further
premise
upon
this
fact
the
conclusion
that
due
to
a
lack
of
unanimity
there
are
certain
unfairnesses
which
result
in
state
taxation.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
if
the
unfairnesses
to
which
they
allude
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
illinois
statute.
as
the
statutes
of
many
cases
which
from
time
to
time
this
court
has
considered,
illinois
provides
both
a
sales
and
a
used
tax.
these
are
intended
to,
and
i
suggest
do
compliment
one
another.
the
sales
tax
applies
to
transactions
within
the
state
and
conversely
the
used
tax
applies
to
interstate
transactions
such
as
the
instant
transaction.
both
are
measured
at
3.5%
in
the
state
of
illinois.
counsel
has
adequately
mentioned
the
recent
1961
catalogue
provision
statute
which
was
enacted
by
illinois.
i
might
answer
in
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
how
many
states
do
have
that,
actually
its
21
states
now.
at
the
time
this
particular
report
was
prepared
there
was
12
states.
now
there
are
21.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
agree
with
the
court.
the
only
reference
i
would
have
would
be
the
comments
and
the
report
with
which
i
would
agree.
the
report
observes
that
the
large
ones
that
have
retail
stores
within
the
state
i.e.
sears
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no,
not
until
recently
your
honor,
not
until
recently,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
definitely,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
suggest
the
case
not
yet
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
mr.
justice
black,
it
does.
specifically
section
439.9
of
the
illinois
statute
specifically
provides
an
administration
expense
rebate.
this
is
2%
of
the
amount
of
tax
collected.
in
other
words,
the
retailer
collecting
the
tax
for
the
state
of
illinois
may
withhold
to
defray
his
administration
expenses
2%
of
the
tax
collected.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
don't
know.
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
one.
now
the
report
to
which
national
in
its
brief
allude
makes
the
argument
that
this
is
one
of
the
unfairnesses
in
state
taxation,
but
as
i'm
now
arguing
i
do
not
think
it's
an
unfairness
consonant
wit
the
illinois
statute.
i
think
the
illinois
statute
before
your
honors,
this
is
in
the
forefront
of
the
state
and
used
taxation.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
mr.
justice
black
i
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
significant.
there
is
another
point
provided
by
the
illinois
statute
which
i
do
think
might
be
significant
to
this
court,
but
not
that
one.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
why
i
--
yes,
as
an
answer
to
your
question,
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
have
to,
as
illinois
does,
pay
them
to
be
the
tax
collector.
of
course,
you
premise
your
question
in
the
fact
that
they
are
not
doing
business
in
the
state.
my
argument
would
be
that
national
in
the
posture
of
this
case
is
definitely
doing
business.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
it
depends
upon
the
particular
fact
circumstances
of
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
it
applies
because
i
--
all
of
the
provisions
of
our
taxes
as
a
matter
fact
are
--
the
tax
specifically
states
that
all
of
the
provisions
of
our
sales
tax
apply
equally
to
the
used
tax,
and
those
on
further
provides
that
where
a
sales
tax
cannot
be
collected
under
the
similar
circumstances,
a
used
tax
cannot
be
collected.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
each
is
treated
equally,
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
right.
the
one
other
additional
section
of
the
illinois
statute
to
which
i
would
like
to
briefly
allude
is
section
439.3,
i
needless
to
say,
when
i
read
it,
i'd
like
to
paraphrase
the
pertinent
part
of
that
statute.
the
statute
specifically
expresses
an
intention
to
avoid
multi-state
taxation,
and
in
so
doing,
subsection
(c)
of
the
illinois
statute
provides
that
where
--
if
there
is
an
interstate
transaction,
such
as
we
have
here,
if
a
tax
is
paid
in
the
state
of
origin,
the
vendor's
home
state,
there
is
a
corresponding
offset
credit
in
the
state
of
illinois.
thus
it
follows
that
if
there
is
a
tax
paid
in
missouri
on
this
transaction,
for
the
extent
the
tax
is
paid
in
missouri
no
tax
need
be
paid
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
probably
it
would
be
a
sales
tax
in
missouri.
as
i
will
later
point
out
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
report
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
missouri
or
the
vendor
state
do
not
collect
the
tax,
but
assuming
that
they
did
collect
the
tax,
there
would
be
an
of
--
or
credit
against
that
tax
in
illinois.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
they
do
not,
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
it's
theoretical
under
the
posture
of
this
case
definitely.
i
--
i
point
to
this
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
this
and
also
to
the
provision
for
an
administrative
credit
merely
to
demonstrate
that
i
think
the
illinois
tax
in
question
here
is
imminently
fair
and
definitely
treats
intrastate
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
in
both
a
fair
and
identical
manner.
mr.
cox
says
in
the
main,
fairly
if
not
quite
fully
related
the
facts
of
the
case
to
the
court.
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
add
a
few
additional
facts,
more
importantly
clarify
a
few
misconceptions
which
have
been
raised
by
the
reply
brief,
and
in
general
present
to
the
court
in
something
of
a
chronological
but
brief
fashion
the
facts
of
the
case
as
they
relate
to
the
issue,
namely
what
in-state
connection
does
this
appellant,
national
bellas
hess
have
to
the
state
of
illinois.
as
indicated
by
mr.
cox,
national
bellas
hess
twice
yearly
sends
into
illinois
two
major
catalogues.
these
catalogues
contain
approximately,
each
catalogue,
approximately
4000
items
of
merchandise.
they
are
sent
into
illinois
with
the
obvious
purpose
of
soliciting
sales
in
illinois.
in
addition
to
these
catalogues,
national
sends
in
to
illinois
sales
books
and
flyers.
now
in
this
point
there
appears
to
be
some
dispute
as
to
the
record.
in
the
reply
brief,
page
3
of
national's
reply
brief
on
footnote
2,
they
seem
to
take
some
offense
that
our
statement
of
the
record
and
claimed
that
we
have
misstated
the
record
by
intimating
that
some
advertising
was
done
other
than
by
catalogue.
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
record
supports
the
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
now
in
oral
argument
mr.
cox
did
allude
to
the
fact
that
sales
books
or
flyers
were
sent.
i
suggest
that
the
record
is
replete
the
answer
on
pages
54,
55
and
58
of
the
brief.
affidavits
by
two
of
its
vice
presidents,
by
national's
vice
presidents,
contained
at
pages
68,
69
and
70,
pages
32
and
33,
referred
to
catalogues,
sales
books
and
flyers.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
go
on
to
distinguish
as
i
would
now
that
the
sales
books
and
flyers
in
addition
to
being
sent
to
costumers
are
sent
to
addresses
with
addressees
designated
merely
as
“occupant”.
the
record
further
indicates
that
these
sales
books
or
flyers
are
usually
included
with
merchandise
sent
into
the
state.
i
think
this
bears
particular
significance
here.
national,
in
the
posture
of
this
case
had
an
excess
of
$2
million
in
sales
in
a
period
of
approximately
15
to
15
and
one
half
months.
now
our
brief
mentions
14
months
which
is
incorrect.
it
would
properly
be
a
period
of
about
15
to
15
and
one
half
months.
their
sales
exceeded
$2
million.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
illinois,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
accepting
this
then,
if
the
usual
practice
was
to
include
sales
flyers
in
their
merchandise,
over
200,000
items
came
into
illinois
which
usually
contain
sales
flyers
or
sales
books
as
they
would
call
them.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i'll
answer
it
if
i
may
now
mr.
justice
fortas.
yes,
the
terms
of
the
statute
would
definitely
cover
that
particular
transaction.
the
statute
is
quite
broad
and
would
--
it
mentions
advertising
per
se.
in
this
regard,
i
might
indicate
that
the
statute
here
is
identical
not
quite
in
le
–
legal
in
total
terms,
but
definitely
in
legal
terms
for
the
statute
before
this
court
in
the
scripto
case,
scripto
versus
carson.
this
particular
statute,
the
illinois
statute
is
identical,
so
the
court
has
had
before
a
statute
identical
in
terms
of
the
illinois
statute
in
the
scripto
case.
for
that
matter
in
the
scripto
case,
this
court
footnoted
and
spelled
out
the
statute,
the
florida
statute
in
scripto
in
the
margin.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
we
--
we
had
independent
con
--
we
have
ten
independent
contractors
in
the
scripto
case.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
pardon
me?
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
it
was
not
this
case.
the
distinction
in
scripto,
mr.
justice
harlan
was
that
there
were
ten
independent
contractors
or
specialty
brokers.
here,
in
lieu,
there
are
--
we
have
the
catalogues.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
think
the
issues
then
would
be
one
resolved
by
the
courts
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
issue
as
i
will,
in
stating
my
suggestion
as
to
the
law
to
be
distilled
in
this
field,
will
turn
on
the
continuous
and
substantial
nature
of
the
business.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
direct
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
illinois
statute
does
not
make
the
distinction.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
it
does,
but
that
is
the
issue
of
the
amici
brief
raised,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
our
statute
would
cover
it.
i
am
not
presenting
to
this
court
and
i
would
make
this
distinction
that
the
--
those
particular
facts
would
satisfy
the
scrutiny
of
the
court
under
a
due
process
argument.
i
am
however,
and
i
make
this
point
quite
strongly
suggesting
that
the
court
has
before
it,
the
statute
is
identical
to
the
statute
in
scripto.
the
court
has
before
it
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
which
i
would
like
my
particular
emphasis
to
go
on.
we
do
not
have
a
macy
situation
as
mr.
justice
fortas
would
suggest,
nor
do
we
have
one
of
these
--
what
i
would
term
the
occasional
type
of
advertising.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
think
again
that
the
issue
would
turn
not
only
on
the
advertising
itself
but
on
the
business
wrote
by
the
advertising.
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
--
nor
did
the
statute
in
scripto
which
this
court
put
in
the
footnote.
that
definitely
the
statute
makes
no
distinction.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes,
that
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes.
question
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
definitely
would
not
tolerate
and
i
doubt
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
would.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no
i
would
definitely
would
not
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
the
results
bear
most
importantly
not
the
method
of
advertising
but
rather
the
results.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
definitely
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
oh!
definitely,
i
think
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
rule
that
they
should
understand
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
the
rule
that
i
will
suggest
should
be
distilled
from
the
cases
of
this
court
is
the
rule
which
businessmen
should
well
understand.
and
that
is
simply
that
where
a
business
is
in
successfully
in
a
state
from
a
business
point
of
view
that
that
should
be
equated
with
presence
in
a
legal
--
from
a
legal
point
of
view.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
think
that
that
is
the
rule
that
the
case
should
disclose
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
correct.
i
think
that
the
form,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
most
notably
the
recent
scripto
decision
definitely
indicate
that
formal
distinction
should
not
be
given
o
--
overemphasis
but
rather
matters
of
substance
should
be
considered.
we
should
look
to
the
business
success
of
the
particular
business
in
the
state
and
not
to
the
formal
arrangements
which
it
enjoins
in
the
states.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
what
are
the
factors
as
the
limits
upon
which
they
would
depend?
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
principle
to
be
distilled
from
all
of
these
cases,
the
nexus
cases,
are
first
that
stress
should
be
played
on
substance
and
not
form.
that
secondly,
continual
and
systematic
activity
should
be
distinguished
from
occasional
or
casual
activities.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
what
is
substance
and
not
form
--
i
might
give
an
example,
yes.
the
use
of
common
carriers
as
opposed
to
the
use
of
their
own
trucks
within
the
state,
i
would
think
that
this
is
the
matter
of
substance
in
that
form.
the
--
thirdly
i
think
that
the
method
of
solicitation
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
legal
distinction
between
the
use
of
a
common
carrier
within
the
state.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
that
substance
should
take
proper
than
the
form.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
in
other
words,
i
am
--
i'm
suggesting
that
the
fact
or
the
distinction
that
you
would
make
would
be
a
formal
distinction
between
a
common
carrier
on
the
one
hand
and
a
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
--
your
own
trucks,
right.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
would
not
in
law.
i'm
making
the
distinction
in
answer
to
the
questions,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
thirdly,
i
think
that
the
method
of
solicitation
matters
not
so
long
as
the
--
it
does
not
bear
upon
the
in-state
efficiency
of
the
business.
and
i
think
that
this
is
definitely
a
principle
we
can
take
from
the
scripto
case.
and
finally,
i
think
that
as
i've
already
alluded,
successful
presence
in
an
economic
sense
should
be
equated
with
sufficient
presence
in
a
legal
sense.
and
this,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
suggest
would
be
a
--
a
fine
rule
and
then
--
the
best
workable
rule
for
the
businessman.
it's
something
he
fully
and
well
understands.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
that
i
think
would
depend
a
great
deal
on
the
--
this
particular
court.
i
definitely
think
that
$2
million
of
business,
in
excess
of
$2
million
of
business,
in
a
period
approximating
15
and
a
half
months,
any
businessman
would
agree
was
economic
success
within
the
state
of
illinois.
i
might
make
another
point
here.
there
were
in-state
cod
deliveries.
again
there
seems
to
be
some
question
raised
in
the
reply
brief
as
to
the
propriety
of
our
mentioning
in
cod
collections
within
the
state.
the
record,
i
think,
bears
us
out
the
quote
that
counsel
mentions.
they
quote
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
8
and
footnote
3.
they
set
out
a
quote
wherein
we
suggest
cod
collections
were
made.
they
--
in
setting
forth
our
quote,
by
the
way
that
is
page
--
there's
typographical
or
a
printing
error
there.
that
is
page
15
of
our
brief
not
page
17.
in
setting
out
that
quote,
i
think
in
fairness
they
might
have
set
forth
a
footnote
which
immediately
followed
that
quote.
and
then
the
footnote
we
correctly,
in
accordance
with
the
record,
indicated
that
cod
collections
were
not
the
--
the
practice
in
all
cases.unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
indicate
in
what
and
how
many
instances
cod
collections
were
made.
however,
the
fact
remains
that
cod
collections
were
made
in
illinois.
in
the
same
footnote,
they
seem
to
take
issue
or
object
to
our
reference
to
the
--
or
common
carriers
or
the
postal
authorities
as
their
representatives
or
as
their
bill
collectors.
now,
i
think
two
particular
statements
by
this
court
might
bear
upon
this
and
again
this
goes
to
the
substance
over
form
argument
which
i
would
now
make
to
the
court.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
writing
in
the
harvester
case
indicated
in
a
similar
type
of
case
that
--
in
these
cir
--
circumstances,
we
are
dealing
with
matters
of
substance
and
not
with
matters
of
dialectics.
and
further,
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
writing
for
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
most
recent
scripto
case
said
“to
permit
such
formal
contractualships
to
make
a
constitutional
difference
would
open
the
gates
to
a
stampede
of
tax
avoidance.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
what,
the
volume?
the
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
--
i
do
not
know
the
exact
answer
to
that
your
honor.
what
--
what
percentage
of
total
revenue
this
would
mean
to
the
state
i
do
not
know.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
the
problem
is
not
a
question,
if
i
may
pause
in
an
answer
to
you
question
mr.
justice.
however,
the
problem
here
is
not
a
question
of
revenue
to
the
state
of
illinois.here
is
the
problem.
i
think
that
the
defendant,
national
bellas
hess,
is
somewhat
ill
characterized
its
position
in
this
court.
they're
suggesting
to
the
court
that
there
is
small
specialty
type
mail
order
house,
one
who
wants
to
eliminate
discrimination,
one
who
wants
nothing
more
than
equality
of
tax
treatment.
i
don't
think
that
the
record
in
this
case
your
honors
or
more
importantly
this
report,
the
state
taxation
report
which
they
rely
upon,
bears
this
particular
status
out
for
them.
if
i
might
point
to
this,
they
make
a
great
to
do
about
the
fact
that
in
most
states,
collection
has
not
or
is
not
made
from
cir
--
in
circumstances
such
as
this.
in
other
words,
most
states
do
not
require
an
out-of-state
vendor
to
make
a
collection
of
its
used
tax.
they
make
a
great
to
do
about
this
fact.
now,
this
is
--
this
is
true.
there's
no
question
about
this.
we're
--
we're
willing
to
admit
it.
only
recently,
illinois
has
enacted
a
statute.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
illinois
or
other
states
have
not
collected
this
tax
in
the
past
bears
one
iota
on
the
constitutional
issue
before
this
court.
however,
and
this
would
be
the
point
i
would
make,
i
think
the
reason
states
have
recently
enacted
this
legislation
does
bear
upon
the
policy
considerations
and
does
portray
national
in
a
little
different
light.
and
i
might
explain
this.
the
record
is
also
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
vendor
states
do
not
require
collection
of
this
tax.
appreciating
this
fact,
it
becomes
rather
obvious
that
national
bellas
hess
or
these
mail
order
houses
are
now
in
a
tax
sanctuary
situation
they're
not
paying
any
tax.
and
not
paying
any
tax
to
permit
it,
to
discriminate
in
a
way
against
the
local
buyers
and
also
against
the
mail
order
houses
who
do
pay
the
tax.
this
i
think
is
a
--
an
important
point
in
understanding
the
policy
and
the
reason
for
this
tax.
this
tax
is
not
intended
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
buyers.
the
purpose
of
this
tax
is
to
have
everyone
treated
equally,
to
permit
the
in-state
seller
the
same
margin
of
profit
that
the
out-of-state
seller
would
have.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
if
you're
asking
me
mr.
justice
white,
do
i
think
that
this
particular
bill
will
pass?
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
oh!
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
definitely.
i
think
it's
intended
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
no,
it's
definitely
not
to
raise
revenue.
the
idea
is
to
protect,
if
you
will,
not
only
the
local
merchants
but
the
intrastate
merchants
who
are
collecting
and
remitting
the
illinois
tax.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
the
statute
was
passed
in
july
1,
1961.
the
particular
tax
in
question
ran
from
july
17,
1961
to
october
31,
1962.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
july
1,
1961.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
we're
precluded
from
collecting
a
tax
--
a
sales
tax
by
this
court's
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
--decision
in
the
mcleod
case.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
the
mcleod
case
indicated
that
the
sale
would
have
to
be
within
the
state
which
would
have
been
definitely
not.
we
make
no
argument
to
the
sale
as
within
the
state.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well,
this
is
the
court's
decision
in
--
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
mis
--
the
late
mr.
justice
wiley
rutledge
wrote
a
vigorous
dissent
in
mcleod,
if
i
could
possibly
pair
his
phrases.
he
did
not
agree
that
in
mcleod
a
tax
should
not
be
collected
and
it
should
not
border
upon
the
semantics
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
sales
or
used
tax.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
well
i
--
i
think
that
or
more
properly,
the
right
to
collecting
a
used
tax,
and
this
is
the
reason
we
collect
the
used
tax.
mr.
terence
f.
maccarthy
yes
we
do.
i
like
for
a
moment
to
turn
in
conclusion
to
the
cases
real
briefly.
national
places
tremendous
reliance
upon
the
miller
case
and
i
think
that
this
reliance
is
somewhat
misplaced,
and
i
think
it's
somewhat
misplaced
because
national's
failed
to
appreciate
the
particular
facts
in
miller.
i'd
like
to
briefly
mention
some
five
distinctions
in
miller
which
i
think
sufficiently
distinguish
miller
from
this
case.
first
of
all,
national
in
its
brief
and
now
again
in
its
oral
argument
refers
to
the
regular
deliveries
in
miller.
conversely,
the
court
in
deciding
miller
specifically
referred
to
these
deliveries
as
occasional
deliveries.
again,
mr.
justice
clark
in
writing
the
scripto
decision
referring
to
miller,
again
referred
to
the
“occasional
deliveries”
in
miller.
again,
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
3,
national
refers
to
the
regular
mailings
in
miller.
conversely,
this
court
in
deciding
miller
referred
to
the
occasional
sales
circulars
in
miller.
national
fails
to
make
a
distinction
which
is
i
think
quite
failing
in
miller,
and
that
is
that
in
the
miller
case
the
buyers
left
the
state
of
maryland,
went
in
to
the
state
of
delaware
and
at
the
vendor's
stores
made
the
purchase.
they
do
not
particularly
give
any
credence
to
this
fact.
however,
the
majority
of
the
court
in
writing
miller
specifically
noted
that
the
seller
in
the
miller
case
did
not
know
where
the
goods
were
to
be
used.
now
mr.
justice
douglas
in
writing
a
dissent
felt
otherwise
and
believed
that
the
seller
should've
known
where
they
were
used.
the
fact
remains
that
whether
or
not
he
did
or
did
not
know
was
pertinent.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
