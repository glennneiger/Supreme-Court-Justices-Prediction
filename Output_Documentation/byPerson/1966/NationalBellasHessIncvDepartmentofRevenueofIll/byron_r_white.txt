justice

r.
white
mr.
cox,
would
a
due
process
decision
such
as
miller
in
this
area
disentitled
congress
to
subject
to
these
mail
order
houses
to
jurisdiction
of
the
state
taxation
if
congress
wanted
to?
i
mean,
could
congress
other
--
do
otherwise
and
what
is
done
in
preserving
this
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
it's
--
but
do
you
think
the
commerce
clause
judgment
like
that
would
overwrite
the
due
process
considerations?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
real
--
my
real
question
is
in
connection
with
this
current
bill
in
the
committee's
considerations
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
you
feel
the
--
is
there
any
evidence
they
felt
constrained
because
of
miller
in
such
cases
to
come
out
with
the
answer
it
did
in
miller
and
maryland.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
--
you
really
think
the
difference
between
common
carrier
delivery
and
using
our
own
delivery
trucks
is
that,
that's
a
real
and
substantial
one
that
the
case
ought
to
turn
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
you
have
the
common
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
asked
--
that's
what
i
asked,
whether
you
think
that
makes
--
that
that
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
critical
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
--
are
these
--
are
these
mostly
cod
deliveries?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
whose
--
whose
goods
are
they
when
they
get
them
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
make
any
difference
to
you?
it
wouldn't,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
take
it,
but
you
really
don't
know
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
--
you
wouldn't
really
say
you
would
argue
for
a
different
result
if
bellas
hess
here
simply
switched
from
sending
in
catalogues
through
regular
advertising
for
the
newspapers
and
in
on
television
and
radios
and
sold
the
same
amount
of
goods
as
a
result
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
form,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
really
is
--
you
really
think
this
may
be
a
business
regulation
device
rather
than
a
revenue
reason
making
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
bill
--
the
illinois
law
is
really
a
business
regulation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
--
not
revenue
raise,
not
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
far
back
do
you
have
it
like
that?
how
far
back
do
you
permit
it
to?
when
does
the
statue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
wanted
to
against
bellas
hess,
how
far
back
did
you
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
can
do
this,
why
--
if
you
can
do
this
to
collect
the
use
tax
from
bellas
hess
whether
they
collect
it
from
the
purchaser
or
not,
why
couldn't
you
just
apply
a
failed
tax
to
these
sales,
these
interstate
sales
made
by
bellas
hess
to
fire
in
illinois?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
basis
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
should
it
have
to
be
within
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
why?
how
do
you
understand
it?
what's
the
--
why
is
the
rule
--
why
is
there
a
rule
against
that
from
the
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
you
would
say
yes
you
should?
if
you
can
do
this
you
should
be
able
to
--
to
let
the
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
cons
--
it
constitutionally
forced
to
use
a
used
tax
rather
than
a
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
illinois
for
example
should
be
able
to
specify
the
prices
in
which
a
mail
order
house
who
sell
particular
merchandise
from
illinois
by
mail?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
about
this
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
price
--
this
price,
that's

not
about
