mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
presents
the
question
whether
illinois
constitutionally
require
an
out-of-state
mail
order
seller
to
collect
the
used
tax
which
illinois
levies
upon
its
residents
subsequent
use
of
goods
purchased
at
retail,
where
the
out-of-state
seller
has
neither
a
place
of
business
nor
property
nor
salesman
nor
any
other
kind
of
representative
within
the
jurisdiction.
the
facts
are
very
simple.
appellant
is
a
mail
order
house
with
its
only
offices
and
warehouse
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
twice
a
year
it
sends
out
through
the
mail
would-be
purchasers
in
illinois
and
elsewhere,
catalogues
seeking
purchasers
for
its
goods.
now
the
catalogues
are
simply
deposited
in
the
mail,
other
fliers
which
were
small
sales
book
are
sent
out
occasionally
through
the
year.
the
would-be
purchasers
write
in
to
the
kansas
city
office
where
their
orders
are
accepted
or
rejected.
the
orders
which
are
accepted
are
delivered
usually
to
the
united
states
mails
in
kansas
city,
but
occasionally
to
a
common
carrier
like
the
american
railway
express
and
they
are
thus
delivered
to
the
purchasers
in
all
of
the
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
wide
variety
of
merchandise
including
books,
but
a
large
part
of
it
is
dry
goods.
illinois
since
1955
has
levied
a
use
tax
upon
costumer's
use
of
goods
purchased
at
retail.
and
it
requires
retailers
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
illinois
to
collect
the
tax.
originally,
illinois
gave
a
customary
meaning
to
retailers
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
illinois,
but
in
1961
it
added
the
artificial
definition
whose
constitutionality
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
provision
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
it
provides
that
retailer
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
this
state
shall
include
engaging
and
soliciting
orders
within
this
state
from
users
by
means
of
catalogues
or
other
advertisings.
in
effect
therefore,
what
illinois
is
asserting
is
the
right
to
impose
upon
an
out-of-state
seller
the
duty
to
collect
the
tax
even
so
it
is
never
been
within
the
jurisdiction
and
does
nothing
more
than
send
advertising
through
the
mail.
of
course
that
provision
alone
couldn't
possibly
be
enforced
by
usual
methods
of
collection.
so
having
created
one
fiction,
illinois
had
to
create
another
fiction.
it
provided
that
those
who
were
deemed
to
be
doing
--
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
illinois,
when
they
weren't,
should
also
be
deemed
to
consent
to
the
secretary
of
state
being
their
agent
for
the
service
process,
when
in
fact
of
course
they
had
given
no
such
incent.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
artificiality
of
those
provisions
in
any
way
makes
them
unconstitutional.
illinois
can
say
its
black
and
it's
white
if
it
wishes,
but
i
do
submit
that
the
artificiality
of
the
definition
shouldn't
obscure
what
illinois
is
actually
doing.
relying
on
the
statute
in
question,
illinois
first
assessed
texas
beginning
with
the
effective
date
of
the
amendment
against
the
appellant,
and
then
later
brought
suit
by
service
upon
the
secretary
of
state.
we
entered
a
special
appearance
and
preserved
our
rights
throughout
the
litigation.
the
trial
judge
granted
the
appellant's
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed.
it
stated
the
case
in
our
judgment
entirely
fairly
and
finding
that
we
had
no
property,
no
representatives,
no
place
of
business,
no
nothing
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
in
illinois,
it
said
nevertheless
the
regular
sending
of
advertising
through
the
mails
was
enough
to
permit
illinois
to
impose
these
extra
territorial
obligations.
there
are
two
other
facts
which
i
must
emphasize.
one
of
them
was
stated
by
a
special
subcommittee
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
it
made
an
exhaustive,
much
the
most
exhaustive
study
in
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce,
and
which
emphasized
that
it
must
be
brought
in
mind
that
efforts
to
subject
mail
are
to
sales,
to
sales
taxation
involve
not
only
the
major
houses,
but
also
a
large
number
of
much
smaller
businesses.
we're
not
talking
here
about
sears
and
montgomery
ward.
they
have
retail
outlets
in
almost
every
jurisdiction
and
therefore
it
clearly
subject
to
their
power.
we're
talking
about
firms
like
the
appellant
which
is
133rd
besides
in
mail
order
sale
of
wards,
and
about
an
even
larger
number
--
mr.
archibald
cox
alright,
well
bigness
is
relative
and
we
are
big
to
many
other
people
who
would
be
affected
by
this
legislation.
i
can't
help
thinking
of
a
typical
person
affected
by
this
legislation.
my
neighbor
who
used
to
have
a
mail
order
business
in
massachusetts,
he
had
five
employees
during
most
of
the
year.
it
grows
up
to
20
in
the
pre-christmas
season.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
said
his
catalogues
all
over
the
united
states,
and
under
this
kind
of
legislation
would
have
to
be
a
tax
collector
for
50
states.
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
here,
our
regular
mailings
were
twice
a
year,
and
then
there
were
smaller
sales
books.
i
think
that's
customary
with
nearly
all
mail
ordered
businesses.
of
course
some
of
them
appear
weekly
in
the
new
york
times,
we
all
see
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
would
think
when
--
when
one
can
do
the
kind
of
advertising
that
many
department
stores
do
such
as
masons
of
the
harvard
cooperative
society,
where
they
send
out
sometimes
in
the
newspaper
regular
advertising
once
a
week
or
oftener
that
that
was
in
substance
indistinguishable
from
this
case,
as
we
think
the
regularity
of
the
advertising
in
miller
and
maryland
was
indistinguishable
from
this
case.
now
the
second
fact
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize
in
particular
is
that
if
illinois
can
impose
this
obligation,
so
can
every
other
sales
or
use
tax
state.
we're
not
talking
here
about
an
obligation
running
to
a
single
state.
we're
talking
about
whether
a
mail
order
business
of
moderate
size
or
smaller
size
which
regularly
sends
out
its
catalogues
two
or
three
times
a
year,
merely
because
it
puts
its
catalogues
in
the
mail
for
national
consumer
market,
can
be
required
to
collect
used
taxes
for
10,
20
perhaps
as
many
as
40
or
42
today,
sales
to
the
used
tax
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
17
states
which
now
have
legislation
of
this
kind
on
the
books.
it
may
have
gone
up
slightly,
but
17
is
the
figure
that
sticks
in
my
mind.
there
is
almost
no
state
which
in
fact
takes
steps
to
enforce
it
today.
most
of
the
state
sales
tax
administrators
testified
before
this
special
committee
i
referred
to,
that
they
didn't
think
they
had
the
power
to
impose
this
kind
of
legislation.
but
it's
on
the
books.
there
is
not
slightly
--
slightest
doubt
that
it
would
be
enforced
if
this
case
were
to
be
affirmed.
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed,
because
it
violates
both
the
due
process
and
interstate
commerce
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution.
our
first
point
is
that
the
decision
below
is
contrary
to
the
governing
precedence
in
this
court.
the
issue
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
the
american
oil
case
a
few
terms
ago,
is
one
of
nexus.
is
--
there's
some
definite
connection
between
the
state
and
the
person
on
whom
it
seeks
to
lay
the
burden?
now
when
you
read
the
cases
you
will
find
that
they
draw
a
very
sharp
line
of
distinction.
when
the
foreign
corporation
has
their
place
of
business,
a
retail
outlet
or
salesman
or
solicitors
of
any
kind
within
the
state,
then
the
court
has
sustained
jurisdiction
to
require
seller
collection.
but
where
there
is
only
regular
advertising,
and
just
as
regular
as
in
this
case,
plus
delivery
across
state
line
the
court
has
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
impose
seller
collection.
there
are
two
cases
that
i
would
call
attention
to
particularly,
because
they
seem
to
me
to
come
very
close
to
the
point
and
one
of
them
plainly
draws
the
very
line
on
which
we
rely.
i
refer
first
to
nelson
against
sears,
roebuck.
there
the
court
sustained
iowa's
jurisdiction
to
require
sears
to
collect
the
used
tax
on
mail
order
sales,
but
it
didn't
because
sears
had
retail
outlets
doing
a
local
business
in
iowa.
the
opinion
is
very
clear
on
this
point.
justice
douglas
referred
to
the
fact
that
sears
had
those
stores
and
then
said
that
since
iowa
has
extended
to
it,
that
is
sears,
that
privilege
of
having
the
retail
stores,
iowa
can
exact
this
burden
as
a
price
of
enjoying
the
full
benefits
flowing
from
its
iowa
business,
and
of
course
we
don't
have
any
such
stores
or
any
other
kind
of
local
business.
then
he
went
on
to
advert
to
the
situation
of
the
mail
order
seller
that
has
no
retail
stores
and
said
very
explicitly
“unlike
respondent,
they
are
not
receiving
benefits
from
iowa
for
which
it
has
power
to
exact
price.”
and
that
line
drawn
in
that
case
is
the
very
one
on
which
we
stand
here.
the
second
case
to
which
i
would
--
which
i
would
particularly
emp
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
the
--
as
far
as
i
know
the
situation
is
the
one
found
by
the
special
house
committee
that
collection
of
sales
and
used
taxes
is
virtually
unknown,
those
are
the
committee's
words.
in
states
where
a
seller
does
only
a
mail
order
business
of
the
practice
right
across
the
board
has
been
to
adhere
to
the
distinction
which
i
submit
derives
properly
from
the
sears
case.
now
the
second
case
that
seems
to
us
to
be
controlling
in
principle
was
miller
and
maryland.
there,
miller
was
a
furniture
store
located
in
wilmington
and
therefore
necessarily
fairly
near
the
maryland
line.
it
set
out
advertising,
regular
advertising,
four
times
a
year
to
address
the
costumers
in
maryland
as
well
as
in
delaware
of
course,
and
it
advertised
daily,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
wilmington
papers
circulating
in
maryland.
costumers
came
to
the
store
normally
to
select
their
merchandise,
but
the
merchandise
was
delivered
by
miller's
trucks
driven
by
miller's
employees.
the
court
held
nevertheless
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
now
we
say
if
continuous
regular
advertising
plus
delivery
with
your
own
trucks
is
not
enough
to
make
jurisdiction,
but
then
surely
where
you
don't
make
delivery
with
your
own
truck
take
away
that
point
of
contact
and
the
advertising
alone
cannot
be
a
sufficient
jurisdiction.
it
was
just
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
decided
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
and
under
the
due
--
due
process
clause.
there
are
overtones
of
commerce
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
these
clauses,
and
i
think
that
both
clauses
in
a
way
are
two
ways
of
getting
it
the
same
thing
and
that's
why
we
rely
on
both.
but
it
was
essentially
in
terms
of
jurisdiction.
now
the
miller
case,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
several
things
about
it,
but
most
particularly
that
our
position
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
position
taken
by
the
four
dissenting
justices
in
miller,
because
they
rely
very
heavily
on
the
regular
deliveries
in
miller's
truck.
and
of
course
we
do
know
such
thing.
we
put
nearly
all
our
goods
in
the
post
office
in
kansas
city.
we
do
make
some
deliveries
to
the
railway
express
agency
in
kansas
city,
but
we
don't
have
anybody
using
the
illinois
highway
or
making
household
deliveries.
in
this
connection,
it'll
take
just
a
moment.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
bill
introduced
at
the
last
session
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
was
only
once
in.
it
cuts
back
jurisdiction
in
the
cases
of
people
who
have
solicitors
to
those
who
have
a
business
location
in
the
state,
but
that
doesn't
matter
here.
it
preserves
the
existing
rule
with
respect
to
mail
order
sales,
but
we
deem
to
be
the
existing
rule.
and
it
adopts
in
the
case
of
household
deliveries
the
position
taken
by
the
dissenters
in
miller
and
maryland.
i
call
attention
to
this
simply
to
show
the
consistency
of
our
view
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
bill
has
been
reintroduced
at
this
session,
but
it
has
not
yet
come
before
the
committee
for
action.
it's
--
it's
too
early.
it
was
favorably
reported
with
only
one
dissenting
vote
by
a
35-man
committee,
the
last
session.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
i
would
think
it
could.
i
would
think
this
was
--
while
congress
doesn't
have
the
last
word
on
due
process,
it
certainly
is
entitled
to
express
its
judgment
with
respect
to
what
is
fair.
furthermore,
i
suppose
that
the
bill
--
such
a
bill
would
not
simply
be
a
congressional
declaration
of
what
is
due
process,
but
an
exercise
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
what
is
--
well,
i
think
the
court
would
take
it
into
account
and
defer
to
the
judgment
of
congress
upon
the
fact
that'll
consider
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
absolutely
not
your
honor.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
regarded
this
as
this
question
as
open
as
they
had
to
do
under
the
--
under
the
cases
did
not
feel
constrained
by
miller.
the
whole
tone
was
one
of
what
is
fair,
and
indeed
the
committee
came
up
with
a
recommendation
first
that
while
seller
collection
might
be
reasonable
if
the
divergences
within
state
legislation
were
eliminated
that
in
the
view
of
those
divergences
and
the
burden
that
is
put
upon
out-of-state
sellers
by
subjecting
them
to
this
kind
of
extra
territorial
legislation.
that
unless
they
all
conform
to
a
uniform
statute
then
the
burden
could
not
fairly
be
imposed.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
three
reasons
your
honor.
the
--
and
the
first
--
and
this
which
i
may
say
too
was
clearly
found
by
the
special
committee.
it
pointed
out
that
the
out-of-state
seller
has
all
the
burdens
of
the
local
merchants
plus
others.
i
think
there
are
three
kinds.
they
arise
first
simply
from
the
duplication.
you
have
to
make
reports
to
50
states.
you
have
to
keep
separate
records
for
50
states
which
you
don't
have
to
do
if
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what's
that?
mr.
archibald
cox
there
you
are
receiving
some
--
at
the
stores,
you
keep
records
only
for
the
one
state
and
you
are
receiving
some
benefits
from
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
second
--
second
reason
is
the
divergences
among
the
laws
of
the
different
states
which
are
very
wide
and
very
important.
even
in
the
rate
of
tax,
there
are
eight
different
taxes
today.
they
are
different
in
the
roads
for
counting
as
applied
to
any
one
who
has
credit
sales.
you
make
reports
with
different
kinds
and
to
different
arrangements
for
auditing.
the
most
dramatic
illustration
of
course
is
in
terms
of
exemptions.
how
is
the
seller
in
one
place
of
business,
regarding
he
can
do
it,
but
think
of
the
enormous
burden.
it's
an
impossible
burden
of
keeping
track
of
the
different
exemptions
under
the
laws
of
different
state.
now
it
may
be
said
well
the
sellers
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
exemption,
but
that
still
results
in
discrimination
against
those
who
engage
in
interstate
transactions
whether
the
burden
falls
on
the
buyer
or
on
the
seller.
then
there's
a
third
burden
that
is
not
applicable
to
the
local
merchant,
and
that
is
that
the
out-of-state
seller
has
a
far
greater
--
the
out-of-state
seller
is
simply
not
able
to
collect
the
tax
with
the
same
fees
that
the
local
merchant
can
do
with
someone
standing
there
face
to
face
with
him.
this
is
again
well
documented.
the
special
subcommittee
found
that
the
rate
of
non-collection
ranged
from
30
to
75%.
our
own
experience
is
that
we've
been
unable
to
collect
in
an
average
of
40%
of
the
cases,
where
our
local
stores,
we
do
have
three
states
in
which
we
have
local
stores,
make
it
our
obligation
to
collect
the
tax.
40%
of
the
cases
on
a
3.5%
sales
tax
comes
to
your
paying
virtually
a
1%
gross
receipts
tax.
and
this
results
of
course
from
the
fact
that
the
man
is
far
away
and
he
sends
in
the
money
for
his
order
and
it
doesn't
include
the
tax
pay.
and
while
you
may
bill
him,
you
just
don't
get
the
money
back
and
it's
a
small
sum
and
then
the
laws
falls
on
the
seller,
so
that
i
think
for
those
three
reasons,
but
especially
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
burden.
you
do
have
an
obligation
that
results
in
discrimination
against
the
out-of-state
seller.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
couldn't
say
as
to
that.
i
did
say
that
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house,
which
you
say
a
powerful
and
important
committee,
favorably
reported
such
a
bill
with
only
one
dissenting
vote.
i
assume
that
the
other
members
were
content
to
be
regarded
in
favor.
mr.
archibald
cox
last
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
last
section,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
tax
bill?
the
only
one
i
think
of
--
well
it
was
referenced
to
decision.
the
one
that
followed
northwest
la
--
northwest
portland
cement,
which
again
drew
the
line
that
case
and
refused
to
go
farther.
mr.
archibald
cox
income
tax.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
changing
the
federal
tax
laws?
i
didn't
have
that
in
mind
when
i
answered
your
honor's
question
and
i
supposed
there
--
i
supposed
there
are
large
number
of
those
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
one
dealing
with
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce.
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
that
was
a
response
to
a
decision
of
this
kind
was
the
one
dealing
with
the
income
tax
which
said
to
northwest
light
“this
far
but
no
farther”.
i
don't
think
it
overturned
the
decision
but
it
said
not
any
farther.
now
the
second
--
i've
referred
already
in
answer
to
justice
fortas's
question
to
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
the
multiplicities
and
discriminatory
burdens
that
you
necessarily
suffered,
if
you
have
a
business
in
one
location
and
are
forced
to
act
as
tax
collector
for
a
large
number
of
locations.
of
course,
the
other
side
of
the
kind
is
that
illinois
is
attempting
to
impose
a
tax
upon
us
here,
even
though
the
appellant
receives
no
benefits
or
protection
from
illinois
government.
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
--
the
sears
case
between
those
who
have
local
outlets,
and
later
those
who
had
local
solicitors
in
a
state
using
its
highway
receiving
police
protection.
and
those
whom
--
who
receive
no
benefit
as
justice
douglas
put
it
for
which
iowa
can
exact
the
price,
because
they
have
nothing
in
illinois,
is
one
that's
worded
in
a
very
fundamental
principle
that
runs
through
all
the
tax
cases
of
this
court.
the
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
in
cases
involving
attempts
to
put
tax
burdens
upon
those
engaging
in
interstate
transaction.
that
the
burdens
must
have
some
reasonable
relation
to
the
benefits
which
the
one
i'm
holding
the
burdens
are
put,
receives
from
the
taxing
state.
now
here
we're
very
clearly
receive
no
benefits
whatsoever
in
any
usual
sense
because
we're
not
there.
the
state
says
in
its
brief
“national's
common
carriers,
delivering
agents
and
bill
collectors
continually
and
systematically
use
among
other
list
obvious
things
are
wrong.”
the
court
below
stated
the
facts
i
think
a
good
deal
more
fairly,
or
faced
them
a
good
deal
more
candidly.
it
said,
and
the
record
sustains
it,
national
does
not
have
in
illinois
any
agent
or
other
type
of
representative
to
deliver
merchandise,
to
accept
payments
or
to
service
merchandise
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
suggest
that
because
miller
and
maryland
held
the
opposite.
i
simply
say
that
we
don't
have
even
the
delivery
trucks.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they're
not
ours,
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
they're
the
railway
express.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes!
i
think
that
is
an
important
fact.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
it
--
well
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
your
honor,
i
think
maryland
--
miller
and
maryland
would
sustain
us
even
if
the
delivery
trucks
were
there,
but
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
nexus
this
is
extremely
important.
if
the
kind
of
indirect
benefit
that
it
suggested
that
we
get
--
supposed
we
give
--
put
merchandise
in
the
united
states
mails,
and
then
the
united
states
mails
and
the
purchasers
operate
under
the
protection
of
illinois,
were
enough
of
a
benefit
to
justify
this
then
i
would
suppose
that
massachusetts
could
tax
florida
hotels
because
massachusetts
citizens
--
because
florida
hotels
exploit
the
massachusetts
citizens.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
--
usually
the
cash
is
sent
in
with
the
mail
order.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
presume
the
title
passes
when
they
are
delivered
to
the
railway
express
and
to
the
united
states
mail.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
is
the
point
in
our
favor.
i
shouldn't
think
that
it
would
make
a
decisive
difference,
but
if
it
is
important
i
take
that
the
title
passes
when
we
deliver
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
we
don't
know
of
any
instance.
that's
the
normal
rule
of
sales,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
the
point
has
been
imparted
in
our
business
and
it's
been
litigated,
so
i
say
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
accept
returns.
i
don't
think
we
ever
make
shipments
on
approval,
no.
but
if
people
sent
things
back,
in
all
fairness
we
would
take
them
back
and
send
them
something
else.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
orders
are
sent
by
--
through
the
mail
by
the
costumers
all
over
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
an
old
company,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
first
to
emphasize
one
factor
which
slipped
through
my
mind
during
my
argument.
and
that
is
that
the
logic
of
the
appellee's
contention
here
would
plainly
open
one
who
does
business
in
a
single
locality.
not
only
do
these
multiplicities
obligations
to
a
large
number
of
states,
but
also
to
the
used
taxes
levied
by
hundreds
of
local
governments.
just
erring
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
theory,
while
we
were
preparing
our
brief
in
this
case,
we
received
the
demand
from
washington,
parish
louisiana.
earlier,
when
this
court
first
decided
the
sales
used
tax
cases,
this
wasn't
a
local
subdivisions
way
of
raising
revenue,
but
today
this
would
mean
that
one
who
sent
out
catalogues
through
the
mails,
and
that's
all
we
do
and
later
delivered
the
goods,
would
have
to
figure
out
in
what
subdivision
these
various
buyers
live
so
as
to
collect
its
used
tax.
and
i
submit
there
is
no
way
on
appellant's
theory
--
at
appellee's
theory
that
these
cases
can
be
distinguished.
our
second
distinction
which
my
brother
clearly
does
in
prayers
but
--
which
finally
would
be
invalid
is
one
that
rested
upon
whether
it
was
catalogues
as
the
book
of
the
month
club
advertising
or
macy's
advertising
in
newspaper.
the
book
of
the
month
club
advertising
is
more
regular,
more
systematic,
more
frequent
than
ours.
the
final
point
to
which
i
want
to
take
time
to
address
the
court's
attention
here
is
one
that
we
touched
upon
earlier.
and
that
is,
i
do
submit
that
to
hold
that
whoever
uses
--
i'm
afraid
my
time
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'll
just
finish
the
sentence,
your
honor.
to
hold
that
whoever
uses
the
mails
to
circulate
advertising
and
deliver
goods
and
thus
gains
economic
advantages
within
a
state,
or
use
of
common
carrier
for
that
matter
within
a
state,
is
subject
to
regulation
or
taxation
or
tax
burden
as
hereby
it,
would
open
the
door
to
all
kinds
of
--
of
reprisals
and
economic
aggressions
that
the
constitution
was
enacted
to
prohibit.
and
i
advert
to
the
example
i
used
a
moment
ago
of
massachusetts
taxing
florida
hotels
because
northeast
airlines
is
the
florida
hotels
representative
to
carry
massachusetts
residents
down
to
florida
where
the
florida
hotels
get
economic
advantages
from
massachusetts.
this
is
an
endless
morass
i
suppose.
mr.
archibald
cox
where
illinois
is
attempting
to
protect
its
citizens
by
something
pertaining
to
the
business
practices
that
set
into
illinois,
then
there
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
a
quite
different
case.
let
me
call
it
your
honor's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
immediately
--
i
would
immediately
have
to
consider
the
vermont
milk
case
where
the
court
held
that
the
attempt
to
regulate
price
of
baldwin
and
seelig
was
improper,
if
i
remember
the
case
correctly.
but
i
think
that
the
extent
of
that
burden
is
quite
different
from
this
problem
of
reaching
out
and
imposing
burdens
on
people
who
have
never
or
in
any
substantive
substantial
and
would
have
been
within
the
state.
the
mails
aren't
our
representative.
we've
never
been
in
illinois
and
i
think
that
fact
must
be
faced
fairly
to
appreciate
this
issue.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
presents
the
question
whether
illinois
constitutionally
require
an
out-of-state
mail
order
seller
to
collect
the
used
tax
which
illinois
levies
upon
its
residents
subsequent
use
of
goods
purchased
at
retail,
where
the
out-of-state
seller
has
neither
a
place
of
business
nor
property
nor
salesman
nor
any
other
kind
of
representative
within
the
jurisdiction.
the
facts
are
very
simple.
appellant
is
a
mail
order
house
with
its
only
offices
and
warehouse
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
twice
a
year
it
sends
out
through
the
mail
would-be
purchasers
in
illinois
and
elsewhere,
catalogues
seeking
purchasers
for
its
goods.
now
the
catalogues
are
simply
deposited
in
the
mail,
other
fliers
which
were
small
sales
book
are
sent
out
occasionally
through
the
year.
the
would-be
purchasers
write
in
to
the
kansas
city
office
where
their
orders
are
accepted
or
rejected.
the
orders
which
are
accepted
are
delivered
usually
to
the
united
states
mails
in
kansas
city,
but
occasionally
to
a
common
carrier
like
the
american
railway
express
and
they
are
thus
delivered
to
the
purchasers
in
all
of
the
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
wide
variety
of
merchandise
including
books,
but
a
large
part
of
it
is
dry
goods.
illinois
since
1955
has
levied
a
use
tax
upon
costumer's
use
of
goods
purchased
at
retail.
and
it
requires
retailers
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
illinois
to
collect
the
tax.
originally,
illinois
gave
a
customary
meaning
to
retailers
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
illinois,
but
in
1961
it
added
the
artificial
definition
whose
constitutionality
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
provision
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
it
provides
that
retailer
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
this
state
shall
include
engaging
and
soliciting
orders
within
this
state
from
users
by
means
of
catalogues
or
other
advertisings.
in
effect
therefore,
what
illinois
is
asserting
is
the
right
to
impose
upon
an
out-of-state
seller
the
duty
to
collect
the
tax
even
so
it
is
never
been
within
the
jurisdiction
and
does
nothing
more
than
send
advertising
through
the
mail.
of
course
that
provision
alone
couldn't
possibly
be
enforced
by
usual
methods
of
collection.
so
having
created
one
fiction,
illinois
had
to
create
another
fiction.
it
provided
that
those
who
were
deemed
to
be
doing
--
maintaining
a
place
of
business
in
illinois,
when
they
weren't,
should
also
be
deemed
to
consent
to
the
secretary
of
state
being
their
agent
for
the
service
process,
when
in
fact
of
course
they
had
given
no
such
incent.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
artificiality
of
those
provisions
in
any
way
makes
them
unconstitutional.
illinois
can
say
its
black
and
it's
white
if
it
wishes,
but
i
do
submit
that
the
artificiality
of
the
definition
shouldn't
obscure
what
illinois
is
actually
doing.
relying
on
the
statute
in
question,
illinois
first
assessed
texas
beginning
with
the
effective
date
of
the
amendment
against
the
appellant,
and
then
later
brought
suit
by
service
upon
the
secretary
of
state.
we
entered
a
special
appearance
and
preserved
our
rights
throughout
the
litigation.
the
trial
judge
granted
the
appellant's
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed.
it
stated
the
case
in
our
judgment
entirely
fairly
and
finding
that
we
had
no
property,
no
representatives,
no
place
of
business,
no
nothing
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
in
illinois,
it
said
nevertheless
the
regular
sending
of
advertising
through
the
mails
was
enough
to
permit
illinois
to
impose
these
extra
territorial
obligations.
there
are
two
other
facts
which
i
must
emphasize.
one
of
them
was
stated
by
a
special
subcommittee
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
it
made
an
exhaustive,
much
the
most
exhaustive
study
in
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce,
and
which
emphasized
that
it
must
be
brought
in
mind
that
efforts
to
subject
mail
are
to
sales,
to
sales
taxation
involve
not
only
the
major
houses,
but
also
a
large
number
of
much
smaller
businesses.
we're
not
talking
here
about
sears
and
montgomery
ward.
they
have
retail
outlets
in
almost
every
jurisdiction
and
therefore
it
clearly
subject
to
their
power.
we're
talking
about
firms
like
the
appellant
which
is
133rd
besides
in
mail
order
sale
of
wards,
and
about
an
even
larger
number
--
mr.
archibald
cox
alright,
well
bigness
is
relative
and
we
are
big
to
many
other
people
who
would
be
affected
by
this
legislation.
i
can't
help
thinking
of
a
typical
person
affected
by
this
legislation.
my
neighbor
who
used
to
have
a
mail
order
business
in
massachusetts,
he
had
five
employees
during
most
of
the
year.
it
grows
up
to
20
in
the
pre-christmas
season.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
said
his
catalogues
all
over
the
united
states,
and
under
this
kind
of
legislation
would
have
to
be
a
tax
collector
for
50
states.
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
here,
our
regular
mailings
were
twice
a
year,
and
then
there
were
smaller
sales
books.
i
think
that's
customary
with
nearly
all
mail
ordered
businesses.
of
course
some
of
them
appear
weekly
in
the
new
york
times,
we
all
see
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
would
think
when
--
when
one
can
do
the
kind
of
advertising
that
many
department
stores
do
such
as
masons
of
the
harvard
cooperative
society,
where
they
send
out
sometimes
in
the
newspaper
regular
advertising
once
a
week
or
oftener
that
that
was
in
substance
indistinguishable
from
this
case,
as
we
think
the
regularity
of
the
advertising
in
miller
and
maryland
was
indistinguishable
from
this
case.
now
the
second
fact
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize
in
particular
is
that
if
illinois
can
impose
this
obligation,
so
can
every
other
sales
or
use
tax
state.
we're
not
talking
here
about
an
obligation
running
to
a
single
state.
we're
talking
about
whether
a
mail
order
business
of
moderate
size
or
smaller
size
which
regularly
sends
out
its
catalogues
two
or
three
times
a
year,
merely
because
it
puts
its
catalogues
in
the
mail
for
national
consumer
market,
can
be
required
to
collect
used
taxes
for
10,
20
perhaps
as
many
as
40
or
42
today,
sales
to
the
used
tax
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
17
states
which
now
have
legislation
of
this
kind
on
the
books.
it
may
have
gone
up
slightly,
but
17
is
the
figure
that
sticks
in
my
mind.
there
is
almost
no
state
which
in
fact
takes
steps
to
enforce
it
today.
most
of
the
state
sales
tax
administrators
testified
before
this
special
committee
i
referred
to,
that
they
didn't
think
they
had
the
power
to
impose
this
kind
of
legislation.
but
it's
on
the
books.
there
is
not
slightly
--
slightest
doubt
that
it
would
be
enforced
if
this
case
were
to
be
affirmed.
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed,
because
it
violates
both
the
due
process
and
interstate
commerce
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution.
our
first
point
is
that
the
decision
below
is
contrary
to
the
governing
precedence
in
this
court.
the
issue
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
the
american
oil
case
a
few
terms
ago,
is
one
of
nexus.
is
--
there's
some
definite
connection
between
the
state
and
the
person
on
whom
it
seeks
to
lay
the
burden?
now
when
you
read
the
cases
you
will
find
that
they
draw
a
very
sharp
line
of
distinction.
when
the
foreign
corporation
has
their
place
of
business,
a
retail
outlet
or
salesman
or
solicitors
of
any
kind
within
the
state,
then
the
court
has
sustained
jurisdiction
to
require
seller
collection.
but
where
there
is
only
regular
advertising,
and
just
as
regular
as
in
this
case,
plus
delivery
across
state
line
the
court
has
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
impose
seller
collection.
there
are
two
cases
that
i
would
call
attention
to
particularly,
because
they
seem
to
me
to
come
very
close
to
the
point
and
one
of
them
plainly
draws
the
very
line
on
which
we
rely.
i
refer
first
to
nelson
against
sears,
roebuck.
there
the
court
sustained
iowa's
jurisdiction
to
require
sears
to
collect
the
used
tax
on
mail
order
sales,
but
it
didn't
because
sears
had
retail
outlets
doing
a
local
business
in
iowa.
the
opinion
is
very
clear
on
this
point.
justice
douglas
referred
to
the
fact
that
sears
had
those
stores
and
then
said
that
since
iowa
has
extended
to
it,
that
is
sears,
that
privilege
of
having
the
retail
stores,
iowa
can
exact
this
burden
as
a
price
of
enjoying
the
full
benefits
flowing
from
its
iowa
business,
and
of
course
we
don't
have
any
such
stores
or
any
other
kind
of
local
business.
then
he
went
on
to
advert
to
the
situation
of
the
mail
order
seller
that
has
no
retail
stores
and
said
very
explicitly
“unlike
respondent,
they
are
not
receiving
benefits
from
iowa
for
which
it
has
power
to
exact
price.”
and
that
line
drawn
in
that
case
is
the
very
one
on
which
we
stand
here.
the
second
case
to
which
i
would
--
which
i
would
particularly
emp
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
the
--
as
far
as
i
know
the
situation
is
the
one
found
by
the
special
house
committee
that
collection
of
sales
and
used
taxes
is
virtually
unknown,
those
are
the
committee's
words.
in
states
where
a
seller
does
only
a
mail
order
business
of
the
practice
right
across
the
board
has
been
to
adhere
to
the
distinction
which
i
submit
derives
properly
from
the
sears
case.
now
the
second
case
that
seems
to
us
to
be
controlling
in
principle
was
miller
and
maryland.
there,
miller
was
a
furniture
store
located
in
wilmington
and
therefore
necessarily
fairly
near
the
maryland
line.
it
set
out
advertising,
regular
advertising,
four
times
a
year
to
address
the
costumers
in
maryland
as
well
as
in
delaware
of
course,
and
it
advertised
daily,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
wilmington
papers
circulating
in
maryland.
costumers
came
to
the
store
normally
to
select
their
merchandise,
but
the
merchandise
was
delivered
by
miller's
trucks
driven
by
miller's
employees.
the
court
held
nevertheless
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
now
we
say
if
continuous
regular
advertising
plus
delivery
with
your
own
trucks
is
not
enough
to
make
jurisdiction,
but
then
surely
where
you
don't
make
delivery
with
your
own
truck
take
away
that
point
of
contact
and
the
advertising
alone
cannot
be
a
sufficient
jurisdiction.
it
was
just
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
decided
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
and
under
the
due
--
due
process
clause.
there
are
overtones
of
commerce
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
these
clauses,
and
i
think
that
both
clauses
in
a
way
are
two
ways
of
getting
it
the
same
thing
and
that's
why
we
rely
on
both.
but
it
was
essentially
in
terms
of
jurisdiction.
now
the
miller
case,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
several
things
about
it,
but
most
particularly
that
our
position
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
position
taken
by
the
four
dissenting
justices
in
miller,
because
they
rely
very
heavily
on
the
regular
deliveries
in
miller's
truck.
and
of
course
we
do
know
such
thing.
we
put
nearly
all
our
goods
in
the
post
office
in
kansas
city.
we
do
make
some
deliveries
to
the
railway
express
agency
in
kansas
city,
but
we
don't
have
anybody
using
the
illinois
highway
or
making
household
deliveries.
in
this
connection,
it'll
take
just
a
moment.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
bill
introduced
at
the
last
session
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
was
only
once
in.
it
cuts
back
jurisdiction
in
the
cases
of
people
who
have
solicitors
to
those
who
have
a
business
location
in
the
state,
but
that
doesn't
matter
here.
it
preserves
the
existing
rule
with
respect
to
mail
order
sales,
but
we
deem
to
be
the
existing
rule.
and
it
adopts
in
the
case
of
household
deliveries
the
position
taken
by
the
dissenters
in
miller
and
maryland.
i
call
attention
to
this
simply
to
show
the
consistency
of
our
view
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
bill
has
been
reintroduced
at
this
session,
but
it
has
not
yet
come
before
the
committee
for
action.
it's
--
it's
too
early.
it
was
favorably
reported
with
only
one
dissenting
vote
by
a
35-man
committee,
the
last
session.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
i
would
think
it
could.
i
would
think
this
was
--
while
congress
doesn't
have
the
last
word
on
due
process,
it
certainly
is
entitled
to
express
its
judgment
with
respect
to
what
is
fair.
furthermore,
i
suppose
that
the
bill
--
such
a
bill
would
not
simply
be
a
congressional
declaration
of
what
is
due
process,
but
an
exercise
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
what
is
--
well,
i
think
the
court
would
take
it
into
account
and
defer
to
the
judgment
of
congress
upon
the
fact
that'll
consider
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
absolutely
not
your
honor.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they
regarded
this
as
this
question
as
open
as
they
had
to
do
under
the
--
under
the
cases
did
not
feel
constrained
by
miller.
the
whole
tone
was
one
of
what
is
fair,
and
indeed
the
committee
came
up
with
a
recommendation
first
that
while
seller
collection
might
be
reasonable
if
the
divergences
within
state
legislation
were
eliminated
that
in
the
view
of
those
divergences
and
the
burden
that
is
put
upon
out-of-state
sellers
by
subjecting
them
to
this
kind
of
extra
territorial
legislation.
that
unless
they
all
conform
to
a
uniform
statute
then
the
burden
could
not
fairly
be
imposed.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
three
reasons
your
honor.
the
--
and
the
first
--
and
this
which
i
may
say
too
was
clearly
found
by
the
special
committee.
it
pointed
out
that
the
out-of-state
seller
has
all
the
burdens
of
the
local
merchants
plus
others.
i
think
there
are
three
kinds.
they
arise
first
simply
from
the
duplication.
you
have
to
make
reports
to
50
states.
you
have
to
keep
separate
records
for
50
states
which
you
don't
have
to
do
if
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what's
that?
mr.
archibald
cox
there
you
are
receiving
some
--
at
the
stores,
you
keep
records
only
for
the
one
state
and
you
are
receiving
some
benefits
from
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
second
--
second
reason
is
the
divergences
among
the
laws
of
the
different
states
which
are
very
wide
and
very
important.
even
in
the
rate
of
tax,
there
are
eight
different
taxes
today.
they
are
different
in
the
roads
for
counting
as
applied
to
any
one
who
has
credit
sales.
you
make
reports
with
different
kinds
and
to
different
arrangements
for
auditing.
the
most
dramatic
illustration
of
course
is
in
terms
of
exemptions.
how
is
the
seller
in
one
place
of
business,
regarding
he
can
do
it,
but
think
of
the
enormous
burden.
it's
an
impossible
burden
of
keeping
track
of
the
different
exemptions
under
the
laws
of
different
state.
now
it
may
be
said
well
the
sellers
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
exemption,
but
that
still
results
in
discrimination
against
those
who
engage
in
interstate
transactions
whether
the
burden
falls
on
the
buyer
or
on
the
seller.
then
there's
a
third
burden
that
is
not
applicable
to
the
local
merchant,
and
that
is
that
the
out-of-state
seller
has
a
far
greater
--
the
out-of-state
seller
is
simply
not
able
to
collect
the
tax
with
the
same
fees
that
the
local
merchant
can
do
with
someone
standing
there
face
to
face
with
him.
this
is
again
well
documented.
the
special
subcommittee
found
that
the
rate
of
non-collection
ranged
from
30
to
75%.
our
own
experience
is
that
we've
been
unable
to
collect
in
an
average
of
40%
of
the
cases,
where
our
local
stores,
we
do
have
three
states
in
which
we
have
local
stores,
make
it
our
obligation
to
collect
the
tax.
40%
of
the
cases
on
a
3.5%
sales
tax
comes
to
your
paying
virtually
a
1%
gross
receipts
tax.
and
this
results
of
course
from
the
fact
that
the
man
is
far
away
and
he
sends
in
the
money
for
his
order
and
it
doesn't
include
the
tax
pay.
and
while
you
may
bill
him,
you
just
don't
get
the
money
back
and
it's
a
small
sum
and
then
the
laws
falls
on
the
seller,
so
that
i
think
for
those
three
reasons,
but
especially
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
burden.
you
do
have
an
obligation
that
results
in
discrimination
against
the
out-of-state
seller.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
couldn't
say
as
to
that.
i
did
say
that
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house,
which
you
say
a
powerful
and
important
committee,
favorably
reported
such
a
bill
with
only
one
dissenting
vote.
i
assume
that
the
other
members
were
content
to
be
regarded
in
favor.
mr.
archibald
cox
last
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
last
section,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
tax
bill?
the
only
one
i
think
of
--
well
it
was
referenced
to
decision.
the
one
that
followed
northwest
la
--
northwest
portland
cement,
which
again
drew
the
line
that
case
and
refused
to
go
farther.
mr.
archibald
cox
income
tax.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
changing
the
federal
tax
laws?
i
didn't
have
that
in
mind
when
i
answered
your
honor's
question
and
i
supposed
there
--
i
supposed
there
are
large
number
of
those
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
one
dealing
with
state
taxation
of
interstate
commerce.
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
that
was
a
response
to
a
decision
of
this
kind
was
the
one
dealing
with
the
income
tax
which
said
to
northwest
light
“this
far
but
no
farther”.
i
don't
think
it
overturned
the
decision
but
it
said
not
any
farther.
now
the
second
--
i've
referred
already
in
answer
to
justice
fortas's
question
to
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
the
multiplicities
and
discriminatory
burdens
that
you
necessarily
suffered,
if
you
have
a
business
in
one
location
and
are
forced
to
act
as
tax
collector
for
a
large
number
of
locations.
of
course,
the
other
side
of
the
kind
is
that
illinois
is
attempting
to
impose
a
tax
upon
us
here,
even
though
the
appellant
receives
no
benefits
or
protection
from
illinois
government.
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
--
the
sears
case
between
those
who
have
local
outlets,
and
later
those
who
had
local
solicitors
in
a
state
using
its
highway
receiving
police
protection.
and
those
whom
--
who
receive
no
benefit
as
justice
douglas
put
it
for
which
iowa
can
exact
the
price,
because
they
have
nothing
in
illinois,
is
one
that's
worded
in
a
very
fundamental
principle
that
runs
through
all
the
tax
cases
of
this
court.
the
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
in
cases
involving
attempts
to
put
tax
burdens
upon
those
engaging
in
interstate
transaction.
that
the
burdens
must
have
some
reasonable
relation
to
the
benefits
which
the
one
i'm
holding
the
burdens
are
put,
receives
from
the
taxing
state.
now
here
we're
very
clearly
receive
no
benefits
whatsoever
in
any
usual
sense
because
we're
not
there.
the
state
says
in
its
brief
“national's
common
carriers,
delivering
agents
and
bill
collectors
continually
and
systematically
use
among
other
list
obvious
things
are
wrong.”
the
court
below
stated
the
facts
i
think
a
good
deal
more
fairly,
or
faced
them
a
good
deal
more
candidly.
it
said,
and
the
record
sustains
it,
national
does
not
have
in
illinois
any
agent
or
other
type
of
representative
to
deliver
merchandise,
to
accept
payments
or
to
service
merchandise
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
suggest
that
because
miller
and
maryland
held
the
opposite.
i
simply
say
that
we
don't
have
even
the
delivery
trucks.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they're
not
ours,
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
they're
the
railway
express.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes!
i
think
that
is
an
important
fact.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
it
--
well
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
your
honor,
i
think
maryland
--
miller
and
maryland
would
sustain
us
even
if
the
delivery
trucks
were
there,
but
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
nexus
this
is
extremely
important.
if
the
kind
of
indirect
benefit
that
it
suggested
that
we
get
--
supposed
we
give
--
put
merchandise
in
the
united
states
mails,
and
then
the
united
states
mails
and
the
purchasers
operate
under
the
protection
of
illinois,
were
enough
of
a
benefit
to
justify
this
then
i
would
suppose
that
massachusetts
could
tax
florida
hotels
because
massachusetts
citizens
--
because
florida
hotels
exploit
the
massachusetts
citizens.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
--
usually
the
cash
is
sent
in
with
the
mail
order.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
presume
the
title
passes
when
they
are
delivered
to
the
railway
express
and
to
the
united
states
mail.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
is
the
point
in
our
favor.
i
shouldn't
think
that
it
would
make
a
decisive
difference,
but
if
it
is
important
i
take
that
the
title
passes
when
we
deliver
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
we
don't
know
of
any
instance.
that's
the
normal
rule
of
sales,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
the
point
has
been
imparted
in
our
business
and
it's
been
litigated,
so
i
say
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
accept
returns.
i
don't
think
we
ever
make
shipments
on
approval,
no.
but
if
people
sent
things
back,
in
all
fairness
we
would
take
them
back
and
send
them
something
else.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
orders
are
sent
by
--
through
the
mail
by
the
costumers
all
over
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
an
old
company,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
first
to
emphasize
one
factor
which
slipped
through
my
mind
during
my
argument.
and
that
is
that
the
logic
of
the
appellee's
contention
here
would
plainly
open
one
who
does
business
in
a
single
locality.
not
only
do
these
multiplicities
obligations
to
a
large
number
of
states,
but
also
to
the
used
taxes
levied
by
hundreds
of
local
governments.
just
erring
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
theory,
while
we
were
preparing
our
brief
in
this
case,
we
received
the
demand
from
washington,
parish
louisiana.
earlier,
when
this
court
first
decided
the
sales
used
tax
cases,
this
wasn't
a
local
subdivisions
way
of
raising
revenue,
but
today
this
would
mean
that
one
who
sent
out
catalogues
through
the
mails,
and
that's
all
we
do
and
later
delivered
the
goods,
would
have
to
figure
out
in
what
subdivision
these
various
buyers
live
so
as
to
collect
its
used
tax.
and
i
submit
there
is
no
way
on
appellant's
theory
--
at
appellee's
theory
that
these
cases
can
be
distinguished.
our
second
distinction
which
my
brother
clearly
does
in
prayers
but
--
which
finally
would
be
invalid
is
one
that
rested
upon
whether
it
was
catalogues
as
the
book
of
the
month
club
advertising
or
macy's
advertising
in
newspaper.
the
book
of
the
month
club
advertising
is
more
regular,
more
systematic,
more
frequent
than
ours.
the
final
point
to
which
i
want
to
take
time
to
address
the
court's
attention
here
is
one
that
we
touched
upon
earlier.
and
that
is,
i
do
submit
that
to
hold
that
whoever
uses
--
i'm
afraid
my
time
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'll
just
finish
the
sentence,
your
honor.
to
hold
that
whoever
uses
the
mails
to
circulate
advertising
and
deliver
goods
and
thus
gains
economic
advantages
within
a
state,
or
use
of
common
carrier
for
that
matter
within
a
state,
is
subject
to
regulation
or
taxation
or
tax
burden
as
hereby
it,
would
open
the
door
to
all
kinds
of
--
of
reprisals
and
economic
aggressions
that
the
constitution
was
enacted
to
prohibit.
and
i
advert
to
the
example
i
used
a
moment
ago
of
massachusetts
taxing
florida
hotels
because
northeast
airlines
is
the
florida
hotels
representative
to
carry
massachusetts
residents
down
to
florida
where
the
florida
hotels
get
economic
advantages
from
massachusetts.
this
is
an
endless
morass
i
suppose.
mr.
archibald
cox
where
illinois
is
attempting
to
protect
its
citizens
by
something
pertaining
to
the
business
practices
that
set
into
illinois,
then
there
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
a
quite
different
case.
let
me
call
it
your
honor's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
immediately
--
i
would
immediately
have
to
consider
the
vermont
milk
case
where
the
court
held
that
the
attempt
to
regulate
price
of
baldwin
and
seelig
was
improper,
if
i
remember
the
case
correctly.
but
i
think
that
the
extent
of
that
burden
is
quite
different
from
this
problem
of
reaching
out
and
imposing
burdens
on
people
who
have
never
or
in
any
substantive
substantial
and
would
have
been
within
the
state.
the
mails
aren't
our
representative.
we've
never
been
in
illinois
and
i
think
that
fact
must
be
faced
fairly
to
appreciate
this
issue.
thank
you
your
honor.
