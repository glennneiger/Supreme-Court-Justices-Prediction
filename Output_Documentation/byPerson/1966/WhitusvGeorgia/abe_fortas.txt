justice
abe
fortas
do
you
know
how
many
states
have
this
so
called
subjective
tests?
justice
abe
fortas
quite
a
few
of
the
southern
states
have
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
those
racially
designations
do
disappear
very
quickly
in
the
process,
don't
they?
i
think
we
were
told
yesterday
and
they
are
the
case
where
the
names
were
put
into
the
box
i
believe
without
any
racial
designation
by
the
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
happens
here
is
--
is
this
correct?
what
happens
here
is
that
the
text
digest
themselves
make
the
racial
distinction
then
from
those
text
digest,
names
are
drawn
for
the
array
and
those
names
are
then
put
in
a
box
without
any
designation
or
anyway
just
by
looking
at
the
names
or
the
paper
determining
which
are
white
and
which
are
negro
and
then
the
drawing
is
made
from
that
box.
now,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
names
from
these
two
lists
for
the
array?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
stage
on
which
you
say
the
discrimination
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
we
have
anything
in
this
record
with
respect
to
the
number
of
negroes
and
whites
that
are
in
the
array?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
total
number
in
the
array.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
only
thing
this
record
contains
is
perhaps
below
25%
of
the
total
array
of
negroes,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
suppose
that
that
were
the
fact,
and
suppose
that
the
consequence
of
the
taxes
in
this
county
were
that
25%
of
the
names
in
the
array
were
the
names
of
negroes
what
--
what
negro
conclusion
would
you
draw
from
that?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
basis
of
25%
figure?
justice
abe
fortas
now
suppose
that
the
state
then
says,
“well,
alright,
we
accept
that
but
we
are
buried
by
showing
that
25%
of
the
names
in
the
array
are
the
names
negroes?”
you
think
that
that
is
between
25%
in
the
population
percentage
or
42%
or
whatever
it
is,
is
so
great
that
it's
constitutionally
objectionable?
justice
abe
fortas
why
isn't
it
a
question
here?
justice
abe
fortas
the
state
--
the
only
evidence
on
this
record
is
25%?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
make
any
effort
to
obtain
more
specific
or
more
accurate
figures
as
to
the
percentage
of
negroes
who
were
represented
by
the
array?
i
did
at
a
later
time.
i
was
not
present
at
this
hearing
where
this
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
mean
you
personally
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
you
change
the
system?
justice
abe
fortas
you
better
tell
us
whether
you
change
the
system
or
you
just
changed
what
you
did
within
the
system?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
tax
digest?
justice
abe
fortas
the
tax
digest
suggests
that
names
are
put
in
the
box,
is
that
designating
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
was
there
any
change
made
with
respect
to
the
tax
digest
--
the
local
designation
on
the
tax
digest
or
the
practice
of
selecting
names
for
the
jury
box
from
those
racially
designated
tax
digest,
was
that
changed?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
after
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
circuit
came
down
and
you
said
it
came
down
in
january
of
1965.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
then
proceeded
and
do
is
to
select
the
names
of
some
negroes
and
put
them
in
the
box,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
what
basis
--
what
kind
of
basis?
where
the
people
are
negroes
or
whites?
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
people
are
there
in
this
county?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
lot
of
people
to
know.
are
these
adults?
justice
abe
fortas
your
law
prohibits
functionally
illiterate
people?
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
it
say
functionally
illiterate.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
relevance
then?
you
mean
that
the
jury
commissioners
knew
everybody
who
is
functionally
illiterate?
justice
abe
fortas
they
wouldn't
be
disclosed
on
the
tax
digest
anyway,
wouldn't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
but
now,
why
--
what
purpose
do
the
tax
digest
serve?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
point
is
that
the
state
of
georgia
must
have
construed
the
mandate
as
a
fifth
circuit
either
disregard
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
circuit
or
you
construed
it
as
being
satisfied
by
putting
some
negroes,
the
names
of
some
negroes
in
the
jury
box,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
of
that.
you
make
--
you
asserted
here
that
the
state
of
georgia
of
this
county,
complied
with
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
circuit
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me,
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
you
say
that
they
complied
with
and
not
by
abandoning
--
getting
the
law
change
or
abandoning
this
on
the
text
digest.
they
complied
with
it
by
putting
the
names
of
some
negroes
in
the
jury
box
--
in
the
jury
box
and
then
drawing
some
for
the
various
panels,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
they
changed
it
by
putting
the
names
of
some
negroes
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
have
to
investigate
their
race?
justice
abe
fortas
for
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
percentage
of
negroes
are
taxpayers
as
compared
with
the
white
people
are
taxpayers?
justice
abe
fortas
yeah.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
what
are
those
figures
mean?
25%
to
30%
of
the
taxpayers
--
justice
abe
fortas
compared
with
about
45%
of
the
population?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
suppose
the
state
takes
a
position
that
in
the
past
tax
digest
were
used
by
the
jury
commissioners
in
this
county
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
goodly
number
of
negroes
on
the
jury
box?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
other
uses
of
the
digest
now?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
used
only
for
this
jury
purposes,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
then
actually,
you
have
here
a
book
called
a
tax
digest
that
has
its
purpose,
the
designation
of
the
names
of
the
people
who
have
a
property
qualification
and
might
serve
as
jurors
with
a
racial
designation.
justice
abe
fortas
which
license
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
have
now?
justice
abe
fortas
or
any
designation?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
adversary
says
that
1966,
the
law
was
changed.
is
that
in
any
of
these
briefs
if
you
recall?
justice
abe
fortas
were
you
reading
from
law
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
available
in
the
published
report
--
statutes
of

now?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you

how
many

justice

i
