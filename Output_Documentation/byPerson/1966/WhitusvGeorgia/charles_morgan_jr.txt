mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
negro
criminal
defendants
from
the
state
of
georgia,
phil
whitus
and
leon
davis
who
in
december
19,
1959
were
accused
of
the
crime
of
murder
of
a
white
man
in
mitchell
county,
georgia,
a
small
south
georgia
county.
this
case
has
been
pending
in
one
court
or
another
since
that
time.
after
an
initial
conviction
in
which
the
trial
--
which
they
questioned
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
juries,
was
not
raised.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
i
recall
it
came
here
by
certiorari,
certiorari
denied
and
then
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
georgia,
denied
there.
it
then
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
denied
there
on
the
grounds
of
non-exhaustion
of
remedies.
that
judgment
is
vacated
by
this
court
and
the
case
went
back
down
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
again
dismissed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
it
was
reversed
and
the
jury
box
in
mitchell
county,
georgia
then
was
condemned,
as
being
racially
exclusive.
now,
in
that
opinion
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court,
three
years
ago
to
this
day,
the
state
of
georgia
was
given
eight
months
after
the
final
judgment
of
that
court
in
which
to
try
and
indict
and
try
--
retry
these
petitioners
before
some
constitutionally
composed
jury
or
tribunal
in
some
place
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
state
had
eight
months
in
which
to
do
that
and
that
any
questions
of
course
would
come
by
regular
appeal
through
the
state
process.
we
are
now
here
alleging
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
which
requires
the
selection
of
jurors
from
tax
digest,
which
are
by
statute
racially
segregated,
renders
the
jury
system
under
which
these
petitioners
were
tried
invalid
and
unconstitutional
and
we
secondly
allege
that
there
was
in
fact
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
and
petit
jury
in
mitchell
county,
georgia.
now
under
the
facts
of
this
case
in
mitchell
county,
georgia,
we
had
initially
and
that
the
county
population
by
the
way,
the
population
of,
those
who
are
eligible
for
jury
duty,
male
citizens
over
21
years
of
age
is
the
figure
we
were
taking
here,
even
though
females
are
eligible
to
serve
in
georgia,
very
few
do
and
i
think
it’s
a
proper
statistics
because
the
figures
are
greater
for
the
total
negro
population
of
the
county
than
they
are
for
negro
males
over
age
21.
the
percentage
is
42%
of
the
population
of
mitchell
county,
georgia
and
that
is
i
think
the
most
conservative
racial
figure
that
could
be
used
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
your
name
comes
from
--
all
jurors
come
from
the
tax
digest
and
of
necessity,
you
would
have
to
be
a
taxpayer.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir,
they
do
not.
those
figures
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
would
be
a
more
accurate
statistic
of
the
total
number
eligible.
that
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record
in
this
case,
that
figure
is
not.
now,
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
prior
to
the
indictment
of
these
two
petitioners,
no
negro
had
ever
served
on
a
grand
jury
in
mitchell
county,
georgia.
one
negro
did
serve
on
this
grand
jury.
on
the
trial
jury,
called
at
the
same
time
as
the
grand
jury
was
called,
of
90
who
were
summoned,
there
were
three
of
the
april
term
report
who
were
negroes.
the
petitioner
was
not
tried
then.
he
was
not
tried
into
the
fall
following.
at
that
time,
90
jurors
were
summoned,
seven
were
negroes.
i
think
under
the
rulings
of
this
case
--
court
including
the
swain
case
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
out
on
the
actual
question
of
systematic
exclusion.
but
beyond
that,
we
have
a
far
more
important
question
i
believe,
of
the
appearance
of
racially
segregated
tax
digest
in
the
small
southern
courthouse
and
a
system
of
justice
that
has
been
traditionally
reserved
or
administration
by
white
man.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
there's
a
little
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
little
dispute
about
that
and
i
can
now
--
i
can
give
it
to
you
directly
from
the
record.
at
page
9
of
the
record
in
253,
a
question
of
mr.
frank
twitty
is
one
of
the
senior
lawyers,
“let's
eliminate
the
april
term
report
with
the
exception
of
april
term
of
court,
have
you
ever
seen
a
negro
sitting
in
a
jury
box
in
mitchell
county,
georgia?
answer,
i
don't
think
so.
i've
been
thinking
about
it
since
i
got
your
subpoena
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
negro
by
the
name
of
arch
diamond,
a
big
republican
and
timothy
ketchum
several
years
ago.
i
thought
they
served
i'm
not
sure
but
i
have
the
definite
impression
they
did
serve
at
one
time,
but
i
wouldn't
be
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
is
mr.
twitty
who
was
a
senior
member
of
the
bar
in
mitchell
county,
georgia,
a
white
member
of
the
bar.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
page
9
in
the
record
of
the
case
number
253.
there
are
two
records,
two
separate
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir,
both
cases
are
here.
you
granted
certiorari
in
number
253
which
was
an
appeal
from
the
grand
jury,
the
systematic
exclusion
of
the
grand
jury
question,
and
after
that,
this
case
was
tried
and
an
application
for
stay
was
made
at
that
time
denied
and
the
case
went
on
to
trial
and
then
the
question
of
the
trial
jury
was
raised
and
you've
granted
certiorari
now
on
the
question
raised
from
the
trial
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
now
it
does.
not
253
--
in
650,
there
is
conviction.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
this
is
--
by
certiorari,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
number
650
and
by
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
in
number
253.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
--
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
yes
it
is
and
a
death
penalty.
there
is
a
--
the
respondent
did
not
file
a
brief.
we
came
to
the
problem
with
clerk's
office
here
of
the
reprinting
of
the
record
you
know
and
this
in
the
second
case,
what
the
respondent
wanted
to
say
with
regard
to
the
trial
jury
--
it's
already
pretty
well
argued
in
his
first
brief
and
with
response
--
with
the
questions
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir
and
we
filed
a
brief
--
we
filed
a
brief
for
petitioners
in
both
cases
but
the
second
brief
adopts
most
of
the
first
brief.
now,
further
on
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
history
of
negroes
having
served
on
trial
juries,
we
have
testimony
elsewhere
and
i
think
i
could
find
it
in
the
moment
one
of
these
records
regarding
the
fact
that
one
negro
or
some
might
have
served
in
mitchell
county,
but
the
great
way
to
check
on
is
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
from
the
record
is
that
negroes
did
not
serve
on
trial
juries
in
mitchell
county.
they
were
sometimes
called,
but
they
really
began
to
be
called
along
about
1965
when
this
case
came
back.
and
i
do
recall
the
record
in
the
first
case
which
went
up
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
came
back
now
negroes
have
never
served
up
to
that
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
on
the
second
jury,
7
of
90,
7.7%
of
the
venire
were
negro
--
that's
a
trial
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
i
recall
it,
none
sir.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
all
stricken.
i'm
not
really
sure
that
they
were
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
appears
from
the
record.
we
can
find
it
of
course
but
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
question
raised
with
respect
to
that
and
may
well
be
that
they
didn't
appear
on
the
particular
venire
that
the
jury
was
stricken
from.
mr.
jones
applied
the
case
and
does
know
exact
words.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
90.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
48
were
put
upon
the
defendant
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
three
of
48.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yet
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
redid
the
list
along
in
--
about
1965.
and
this
grand
jury
contained
a
negro
member.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
was
found
to
be
tainted
but
it
was
used
in
the
selection
process
according
to
the
testimony
that
the
jury
commissioner,
it's
hazy
beyond
this
but
they
say
that
they
did
have
the
old
list
and
they
went
down
it
first
and
first,
they
checked
off
the
names
of
those
who
were
dead
and
those
who
have
moved.
and
this
testimony
by
jury
commissioner
saying,
“but
we
didn't
use
that
then.
we
then
went
on
to
the
tax
digest
and
went
on
the
tax
digest.”
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
directly
from
the
old
tainted
list,
but
the
old
tainted
list
was
used,
i
believe
the
record
will
dispose
this
[voice
overlap]
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
state
may
do
that
within
eight
months.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
now,
under
georgia
law,
the
requirements
for
petit
and
grand
jury
duty
are
that
a
man
be
intelligent
and
experienced
and
upright.
now,
the
record
discloses
when
the
jury
commissioners
wrapped
as
to
whether
or
not
they
give
intelligence
test
or
any
other
sources
of
test,
of
course
the
jury
commissioners
didn't
do
that.
the
opportunity
for
discretion,
the
same
kind
of
discretion
that
was
condemned
generally
in
united
states
versus
--
in
mississippi
versus
united
states
--
united
states
versus
mississippi
and
louisiana
versus
united
states.
same
kind
of
discretion
that
was
existed
in
davis
versus
schnell,
alabama,
regarding
voter
cases
exists
pretty
much
in
the
jury
statutes
in
georgia
and
in
other
southern
jury
statutes
also.
here,
we
have
an
instance
where
there's
a
requirement
by
statute
that
came
into
existence
in
1894
that
racial
data
be
included
and
really
thrust
under
the
noses
of
the
jury
commissioners.
beyond
that,
they
then
have
subjective
test
which
they
must
adopt
and
apply
to
these
prospective
jurors.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right
and
perhaps
the
word
experience,
that's
the
additional
word
for
grand
juror
but
you
don't
have
--
the
amount
of
the
experience
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
then
you've
got
the
question
of
experience
in
what
or
you
know
just
what
does
this
mean?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
really
not
certain,
but
it
is
--
we
didn't
go
into
that
question
and
make
pending
of
the
law
so
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
quite
a
few
in
the
south.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
test
like
or
akin
to
that,
they
do.
good
character,
in
alabama
for
instance,
you
have
to
be
able
to
--
you
have
to
be
able
to
read,
write
or
understanding
which
language
or
there's
an
exception
that
you
can
be
a
freeholder
or
a
householder,
which
under
the
state
definition,
a
householder
is
almost
anybody.
you
have
to
have
a
good
character
in
most
of
the
states,
but
there
is
an
ordinary
character
requirement
in
the
states.
now
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
and
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
and
especially
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
those
of
us
who
talk
constantly,
--
let
me
phrase
it
this
way,
two
thirds
of
the
negro
people
in
the
united
states
who
live
outside
of
the
south
were
born
and
reared
in
the
south.
their
conception
of
justice
came
from
the
courthouse
and
the
county
where
they
were
born
and
reared.
and
many
of
the
complaints
and
plenty
of
crimes
that
we
hear
today,
i
think
come
from
a
background
of
experience
that
says
when
somebody
like
me
for
instance
might
say,
take
your
struggle
out
of
the
streets
into
the
courts
and
the
answer
comes
up,
“that's
where
the
sheriff
was.
that's
where
i
saw
someone
convicted
and
go
off
to
jail.”
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
a
statute
which
is
as
condemnable
as
in
the
hamilton
case
coming
out
of
alabama,
a
contempt
conviction.
the
use
of
monolithic
titles,
we've
got
the
same
sort
of
case.
you've
got
the
johnson
case
on
segregation
in
the
courtroom.
you've
got
the
same
sort
of
case
that
existed
in
ham
with
respect
to
the
use
of
racial
records
and
racial
designations.
and
much
of
what
i'm
talking
about
now
has
very
little
to
do
with
a
particular
fairness
of
the
particular
trials
of
these
two
petitioners.
but
what
it
does
have
to
do
with
is
as
under
map,
the
basic
appearance
of
fairness
of
the
system
of
justice.
and
whenever
we
do
have
racial
designations
and
racial
restrictions
on
the
face
of
relating
to
the
system
of
justice
that
we
have,
we
automatically
bring
that
system
into
question.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there's
not
in
this
case
either.
there
is
no
racial
designation
in
this
case
on
the
cards
that
are
drawn.
the
cards
are
not
different
colors
as
they
were
in
avery.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
avery,
the
slips
were
yellow
and
white
slips
that
were
drawn
out
by
the
judge.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
this
sense,
they're
yellow
and
white
tax
returns.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
doesn't
exist
on
the
cards.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
only
place
where
you
could
have
discrimination
based
on
the
segregation
at
tax
digest
would
be
at
the
first
instance
where
the
names
are
selected
by
the
jury
commissioners.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
we
have
some
varied
estimates.
we
have
a
reasonable
guess
of
25%
by
a
jury
commissioner.
he
also
testified
that
he
could
go
as
high
as
80%
or
90%,
i
guess
that
high,
80%
i
think
was
stable.
we
have
a
total
estimate
and
again,
estimate
and
not
the
exact
figures
of
names
of
the
box.
it
ranges
from
500
to
600
names
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
total
number
in
the
array
but
as
far
as
a
racial
breakdown
of
the
array
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
a
reasonable
or
rough
estimate
of
that.
i
think
from
the
record,
they--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
would
take
the
swain
case
and
draw
from
that
the
legal
conclusion
that
the
petitioners
here
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
of
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
petit
and
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
suppose
to.
the
42%
figure
of
eligibility
which
is
the
lowest
figure
we
have
even
if
negroes
are
lesser
on
the
tax
digest,
we
would
contend
that
that
burden
of
proof
fell
to
the
state
on
the
percentage
figure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
not
the
question
here
but
i
would
think
so
in
another
case
but
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
because
in
the
first
place
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that
the
state
didn't
come
back
with
any
figures
of
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
we
don't
really
think
that
that's
the
evidence
and
certainly
under
the
fifth
circuit
case,
the
scott
versus
walker,
the
recent
cases.
this
--
the
state
has
within
its
control,
racial
figures
regarding
everybody
in
that
county
just
about
that
pays
taxes.
just
a
rough
guesses
or
estimates
of
this
nature
just
don't
jive
with
the
whole
history
of
the
county
and
in
fact
the
first
negroes
served
in
our
grand
jury
with
this.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
jones
might
go
into
that
more
as
to
what
they
went
through
down
in
the
county
and
he'll
speak
right
now
if
that's
alright
and
i'll
reserve
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
last
statement
regarding
the
number
of
people
that
will
be
automatically
released
in
the
event
the
court
reverses
on
the
question
of
tax
digest
recall
for
page
10
of
the
brief
in
the
gideon
case,
the
statement
or
decision
referring
to
the
present
case
of
retroactive
to
allow
over
5,000
hardened
criminals
in
florida
to
be
set
free.
our
only
response
--
that
was
in
the
gideon
case
with
the
state
contended
there
in
brief.
here,
the
state
contends
that
we're
going
to
turn
loose
over
4,000
negro
prisoners
from
the
state
penitentiaries
in
the
event
of
a
reversal
here.
that
argument
was
not
successful
in
the
gideon
case
where
(inaudible)
had
been
a
specific
case
which
was
approved
with
the
law
of
that
case
until
the
gideon
case
and
our
response
to
that
last
contention
is
that
if
they're
in
jail
wrongfully,
they
ought
to
be
out.
now,
regarding
the
historical
questions
on
the
statute,
we've
had
historical
research
done
by
many
in
the
field.
there
seems
to
be
a
split
of
opinion
of
--
as
to
exactly
when
the
anti-negro
voter
registration
pushed
--
came
in
the
south
whether
it
was
1896,
1894
exactly
and
what
year
did
it
take
place.
there
is
very
little
with
respect
to
this
particular
statute
which
was
proposed
as
an
amendment
to
the
voter
registration
bill
that
came
along
in
1894.
there
are
no
racial
reference
is
in
the
publications
in
georgia,
the
original
sources
that
we've
looked
to.
the
atlanta
constitution
of
december
8,
1894
on
page
4,
column
3
in
an
editorial,
stated
that
after
it
admits
that
it's
agitated
the
reform,
it
says,
“the
populist
party
dividing
the
bill
as
a
body
for
what
purposes,
we
do
not
know.”
from
some
of
these
purposes
--
that
time
in
georgia,
the
populist
party
was
quite
a
threat.
the
populist
party
had
not
yet
attached
to
itself
the
doctrines
of
racism.
in
georgia
between
1888
and
1903,
there
were
241
negroes
that
were
lynched,
this
is
the
second
state,
second
only
to
mississippi
in
the
south.
the
problems
of
race,
the
problems
of
voting,
the
problems
of
the
rise
of
a
new
political
party
in
the
south
which
was
aligning
the
interest
of
negroes
with
pro
white
fractions
at
that
time.
all
were
en-captured
by
this
legislation
that
was
proposed
to
the
georgia
general
assembly
at
that
time.
i
can't
give
anything
specific
though
with
respect
to
mention
of
race
in
the
publications
that
had
done.
the
bill,
senate
bill
number
130
reports
to
be
retriever
of
the
georgia
statute
requiring
segregation
on
tax
digest.
i
don't
quite
read
it
that
way.
that
statute
says,
it
purports
to
repeal
the
statute
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
several
tax
receivers
or
tax
commissioners
shall
accumulate
such
statistical
information
in
regard
to
taxpayers
of
such
nature
as
they
shall
deem
to
be
a
benefit
to
the
state
revenue
commissioner.
so
it
does
reveal
the
statute
and
then
goes
on
to
talk
about
statistical
information
and
the
compilation
of
statistical
data.
referring
to
statements
made
regarding
the
use
of
the
old
list,
in
the
compilation
of
the
new
list,
as
the
old
condemned
jury
list,
in
the
record
in
case
number
650
on
page
28,
has
contained
the
statement
that
they
did
use
the
old
list
to
go
through
it
then
they
got
the
--
and
then
used
the
tax
digest
also.
on
this
page
28
reference
i'm
talking
about
now
is
--
solicitor
hand
asked
the
question,
“were
you
present
when
the
jury
list
was
revised
in
february
1965?”
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
revisions
of
the
list
of
course
and
an
actual
throwing
out
of
the
old
list,
it
was
started
anew
from
scratch.
he
--
and
one
of
the
references
is
that
there
is
a
denial
that
the
old
list
was
actually
used.
they
just
said
they
went
through
it
and
checked
of
the
names
and
then
they
came
back
and
i
really
don't
know
what
the
purpose
of
going
through
it
were
if
they
didn't
use
--
they
seem
reports
that
they
didn't.
now,
in
the
record
on
page
48
of
253
under
examination
by
mr.
jones
of
the
city
clerk
tax
collector,
let's
see.
the
statement
is
made
there,
what
record
have
you
make
use
in
making
this
jury
list.
well,
we
used
the
old
list
and
of
course
we
used
the
digest.
you
used
the
old
list
and
the
digest
and
that
was
all
that
you
did
used?
your
honor,
i
submit
the
counsel
is
leading
the
witness
again
and
that's
typically
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
it's
mentioned
in
the
brief,
but
the
law
itself
was
not
contained
in
brief.
i
do
have
a
copy
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
is
the
photocopy
of
senate
bill
number
130
as
passed
in
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
it
is.
this
would
be
the
acts
for
1966.
regarding
the
statistical
breakdown
of
the
number
of
names
there,
we
do
have
the
500
to
600
names
we
do
in
one
instance
have
90
names
drawn
out
of
the
box
apparently
at
random.
we
have
the
names
of
three
negroes
being
drawn
there.
we
have
90,
the
second
time
being
drawn
at
random
apparently
from
the
box.
we
have
seven
names
there
and
no
statistical
studies
were
prepared
for
this
court.
of
course,
we
would
offer
to
have
such
studies
prepared
in
light
of
the
finkelstein
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
based
on
bernoulli's
test
and
laws
of
probability.
if
the
court
so
desired,
we'd
be
happy
to
submit
them
to
the
court
in
a
separate
memorandum
in
a
later
time.
the
fifth
circuit
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
did
call
forward
seven
cases
to
be
argued
and
back
before
the
fifth
circuit
of
which
brooks
versus
beto
was
one
and
davis
versus
davis
governor
was
another.
also
rabinowitz
versus
united
states
was
argued
back
at
that
time.
the
rabinowitz
case
as
i
understand
with
regarding
discretionary
questions
and
the
question
of
the
use
of
discretion
by
federal
jury
commissioners,
says
that
those
federal
standards
are
maximum
standards.
you
can
oppose
other
standards
over
the
able
to
read,
write
and
understand
the
english
language
provisions.
as
i
understand
the
thrust
of
these
cases,
it
is
somewhat
difficult.
we
had
the
case
of
billingsley
versus
clayton
there.
we
attempted
to
bring
that
to
this
court,
the
cert
was
denied.
in
order
to
review
it
along
this
field
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
i
think
the
most
of
the
field
--
the
circuit
most
concerned
with
the
problem.
as
i
understand
the
thrust
of
these
cases,
it
is
the
jury
commissioners
must
be
aware
of
the
racial
makeup
of
the
entire
community
in
which
they
operate
and
they
must
be
aware
of
this
in
order
to
find
a
cross
section
as
to
the
--
and
the
cross
section
is
what
is
required
--
it's
required
from
that
list
and
as
i
understand
the
swain
case,
it's
the
list
that
you've
got
to
have.
we
can
prove
the
list
pretty
well
statistically
by
taking
the
number
of
names
drawn
at
random
from
it
and
moving
right
straight
down
to
the
racial
breakdown
that
we
have.
now,
the
statement
that
was
made
an
argument,
i
do
want
to
question
one
statement
about
the
jury
commissioners
themselves.
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
these
jury
commissioners
knew
about
it
personally
that
was
put
on
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
jury
commissioners
hardly
seem
to
know
very
much
about
anything
much
that
was
going
on
there.
the
percentage
figure
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier
with
mr.
justice
fortas
under
the
cross-examination
by
mr.
hand,
he
said,
“mr.
grovin
(ph)
this
is
just
a
wild
guess
by
you.”
“yes
sir.”
could
it
be
as
high
as
80%
or
60%?”
“well,
it
could
possibly
be
different.
you
just
don't
really
know,
do
you?”
“i
don't
know.”
“you
don't
know
what
the
percentages,
do
you?”
“no,
i'm
not
sure.”
that's
page
25
of
the
record
in
650.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
six,
all
white.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
three.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
generally
out
as
the
argument
not
as
the
fact
that
the
jury
commissioners
did
testify
that
in
their
particular
areas,
they
knew
folks
and
they
took
them
and
they
also
testified
that
their
word
was
pretty
much
law
as
to
who
they
would
take
now
or
temporary.
if
they
recommended
somebody
to
the
whole
commission,
the
whole
commission
would
say,
yes,
we
will
go
ahead
and
take
them.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
was
talking
about
the
case
of
brooks
versus
beto
and
this
is
one
of
the
seven
cases
argued
en
banc
on
december
the
16,
1965.
as
i
see
the
thrust
of
those
cases,
it
is
that
the
jury
commissioner
does
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
community
and
he
is
the
state
official
and
neither
--
i
really
haven't
read
these
cases
you
know
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
and
this
is
recollection
but
in
this
case
or
in
scott
versus
walker
or
davis
versus
davis
governor,
these
were
all
in
that
set,
a
jury
commissioner
came
on
much
as
in
this
case
and
had
access
to
racial
records
there
in
the
county.
the
jurors
names
weren't
drawn
from
those
records,
but
he
had
access
to
the
records,
yet
he
didn't
seem
to
know
anything
about
the
records.
he
couldn't
testify
as
to
who
is
a
negro
and
who
is
not
a
negro.
and
of
course
there
are
difficult
problems
for
plaintiffs
in
civil
actions
or
the
defendants
in
criminal
actions
in
the
techniques
approved
here.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
comment
went
to
that
but
the
jury
commissioner
himself
should
have
knowledge
of
this
and
i
think
there
is
a
thrust
in
those
cases
that
the
jury
commissioner
should
have
knowledge
of
the
entire
community,
about
individual
jurors,
though
i
don't
recall
that,
it
could
be
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
i
would
go
about
selecting
the
juries
is
totally
different
but
we
will
do
it
anyway.
so
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
difficult
in
a
small
county,
a
rural
county
of
this
nature,
for
them
not
to
have
some
knowledge
anyway.
people
work
on
the
farm.
if
your
jury
commissioner
happens
to
have
a
store
that
has
a
charge
business,
he
pretty
well
knows
who
isn't
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
do
i
think
that
they
should
have
that
knowledge?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
at
the
time
of
selection.
i
think
the
knowledge
should
come
from
some
sort
of
a
list.
if
it
comes
from
a
list,
it
ought
to
come
in
a
random
selection
just
straight
down
the
line.
now
as
far
as
techniques
and
modes
of
proof
at
a
later
time
that
you
might
have
in
a
case,
in
a
city
like
birmingham
or
a
city
like
atlanta
where
you
have
a
very
large
population,
the
problem
of
proof
is
just
a
tremendous
problem
and
it
could
very
well
be
that
there
is
--
that
there
might
be
some
record
for
that
purpose
at
some
place
but
i
don't
think
the
jury
commissioner
should
have
that
as
a
consideration
in
their
mind
certainly
not
by
state
law
and
certainly
not
tacked
on
in
a
judicial
system
such
as
we
have
where
it's
just
thrust
at
them.
it's
like
the
andersen
case.
this
maybe
told
to
the
jury
commissioner,
it's
almost
like
saying
to
him,
this
is
a
relevant
consideration
somehow.
if
the
counsel
on
both
sides
are
trying
to
find
out
why
we've
got
segregated
tax
digest
to
begin
with
and
we
don't
know
then
what
in
the
world
would
a
jury
commissioner
think.
there
must
be
some
reason.
there's
a
reason
for
everything.
i
suppose
ordinary
man
think
and
that
reason
must
be
the
racial
distinction.
to
conclude,
we
would
simply
say
this,
a
jury
was
cast
upon
these
defendants.
that
jury
came
from
fluted
wellspring.
we
didn't
--
we
know
that
over
a
period
of
years,
this
court
has
condemned
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
juries.
we
also
know
that
for
period
of
years,
negroes
continued
to
be
excluded
from
juries
in
the
south.
the
remedy
that
we
propose
under
this
case
is
that
the
state
was
given
eight
months
to
try
these
defendants
fairly.
the
conviction
is
unconstitutional
based
first
on
the
tax
digest
segregation
question
as
a
matter
of
law.
secondly,
the
record
discloses
systematic
exclusion
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
state
under
the
law
did
nothing,
the
state
under
the
facts
did
nothing
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
of
georgia
and
any
other
jurisdiction
which
excludes
negroes
from
jury
as
a
matter
of
practice
should
be
advised
that
you
try
them
fairly
and
rapidly
or
they'll
go
free.
we
think
that
these
defendants
should
now
be
cast
out
of
jail.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
negro
criminal
defendants
from
the
state
of
georgia,
phil
whitus
and
leon
davis
who
in
december
19,
1959
were
accused
of
the
crime
of
murder
of
a
white
man
in
mitchell
county,
georgia,
a
small
south
georgia
county.
this
case
has
been
pending
in
one
court
or
another
since
that
time.
after
an
initial
conviction
in
which
the
trial
--
which
they
questioned
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
juries,
was
not
raised.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
i
recall
it
came
here
by
certiorari,
certiorari
denied
and
then
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
georgia,
denied
there.
it
then
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
denied
there
on
the
grounds
of
non-exhaustion
of
remedies.
that
judgment
is
vacated
by
this
court
and
the
case
went
back
down
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
again
dismissed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
it
was
reversed
and
the
jury
box
in
mitchell
county,
georgia
then
was
condemned,
as
being
racially
exclusive.
now,
in
that
opinion
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court,
three
years
ago
to
this
day,
the
state
of
georgia
was
given
eight
months
after
the
final
judgment
of
that
court
in
which
to
try
and
indict
and
try
--
retry
these
petitioners
before
some
constitutionally
composed
jury
or
tribunal
in
some
place
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
state
had
eight
months
in
which
to
do
that
and
that
any
questions
of
course
would
come
by
regular
appeal
through
the
state
process.
we
are
now
here
alleging
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
which
requires
the
selection
of
jurors
from
tax
digest,
which
are
by
statute
racially
segregated,
renders
the
jury
system
under
which
these
petitioners
were
tried
invalid
and
unconstitutional
and
we
secondly
allege
that
there
was
in
fact
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
and
petit
jury
in
mitchell
county,
georgia.
now
under
the
facts
of
this
case
in
mitchell
county,
georgia,
we
had
initially
and
that
the
county
population
by
the
way,
the
population
of,
those
who
are
eligible
for
jury
duty,
male
citizens
over
21
years
of
age
is
the
figure
we
were
taking
here,
even
though
females
are
eligible
to
serve
in
georgia,
very
few
do
and
i
think
it’s
a
proper
statistics
because
the
figures
are
greater
for
the
total
negro
population
of
the
county
than
they
are
for
negro
males
over
age
21.
the
percentage
is
42%
of
the
population
of
mitchell
county,
georgia
and
that
is
i
think
the
most
conservative
racial
figure
that
could
be
used
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
your
name
comes
from
--
all
jurors
come
from
the
tax
digest
and
of
necessity,
you
would
have
to
be
a
taxpayer.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir,
they
do
not.
those
figures
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
would
be
a
more
accurate
statistic
of
the
total
number
eligible.
that
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record
in
this
case,
that
figure
is
not.
now,
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
prior
to
the
indictment
of
these
two
petitioners,
no
negro
had
ever
served
on
a
grand
jury
in
mitchell
county,
georgia.
one
negro
did
serve
on
this
grand
jury.
on
the
trial
jury,
called
at
the
same
time
as
the
grand
jury
was
called,
of
90
who
were
summoned,
there
were
three
of
the
april
term
report
who
were
negroes.
the
petitioner
was
not
tried
then.
he
was
not
tried
into
the
fall
following.
at
that
time,
90
jurors
were
summoned,
seven
were
negroes.
i
think
under
the
rulings
of
this
case
--
court
including
the
swain
case
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
out
on
the
actual
question
of
systematic
exclusion.
but
beyond
that,
we
have
a
far
more
important
question
i
believe,
of
the
appearance
of
racially
segregated
tax
digest
in
the
small
southern
courthouse
and
a
system
of
justice
that
has
been
traditionally
reserved
or
administration
by
white
man.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
there's
a
little
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
little
dispute
about
that
and
i
can
now
--
i
can
give
it
to
you
directly
from
the
record.
at
page
9
of
the
record
in
253,
a
question
of
mr.
frank
twitty
is
one
of
the
senior
lawyers,
“let's
eliminate
the
april
term
report
with
the
exception
of
april
term
of
court,
have
you
ever
seen
a
negro
sitting
in
a
jury
box
in
mitchell
county,
georgia?
answer,
i
don't
think
so.
i've
been
thinking
about
it
since
i
got
your
subpoena
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
negro
by
the
name
of
arch
diamond,
a
big
republican
and
timothy
ketchum
several
years
ago.
i
thought
they
served
i'm
not
sure
but
i
have
the
definite
impression
they
did
serve
at
one
time,
but
i
wouldn't
be
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
is
mr.
twitty
who
was
a
senior
member
of
the
bar
in
mitchell
county,
georgia,
a
white
member
of
the
bar.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
page
9
in
the
record
of
the
case
number
253.
there
are
two
records,
two
separate
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir,
both
cases
are
here.
you
granted
certiorari
in
number
253
which
was
an
appeal
from
the
grand
jury,
the
systematic
exclusion
of
the
grand
jury
question,
and
after
that,
this
case
was
tried
and
an
application
for
stay
was
made
at
that
time
denied
and
the
case
went
on
to
trial
and
then
the
question
of
the
trial
jury
was
raised
and
you've
granted
certiorari
now
on
the
question
raised
from
the
trial
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
now
it
does.
not
253
--
in
650,
there
is
conviction.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
this
is
--
by
certiorari,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
number
650
and
by
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
in
number
253.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
--
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
yes
it
is
and
a
death
penalty.
there
is
a
--
the
respondent
did
not
file
a
brief.
we
came
to
the
problem
with
clerk's
office
here
of
the
reprinting
of
the
record
you
know
and
this
in
the
second
case,
what
the
respondent
wanted
to
say
with
regard
to
the
trial
jury
--
it's
already
pretty
well
argued
in
his
first
brief
and
with
response
--
with
the
questions
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir
and
we
filed
a
brief
--
we
filed
a
brief
for
petitioners
in
both
cases
but
the
second
brief
adopts
most
of
the
first
brief.
now,
further
on
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
history
of
negroes
having
served
on
trial
juries,
we
have
testimony
elsewhere
and
i
think
i
could
find
it
in
the
moment
one
of
these
records
regarding
the
fact
that
one
negro
or
some
might
have
served
in
mitchell
county,
but
the
great
way
to
check
on
is
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
from
the
record
is
that
negroes
did
not
serve
on
trial
juries
in
mitchell
county.
they
were
sometimes
called,
but
they
really
began
to
be
called
along
about
1965
when
this
case
came
back.
and
i
do
recall
the
record
in
the
first
case
which
went
up
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
came
back
now
negroes
have
never
served
up
to
that
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
on
the
second
jury,
7
of
90,
7.7%
of
the
venire
were
negro
--
that's
a
trial
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
i
recall
it,
none
sir.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
all
stricken.
i'm
not
really
sure
that
they
were
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
appears
from
the
record.
we
can
find
it
of
course
but
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
question
raised
with
respect
to
that
and
may
well
be
that
they
didn't
appear
on
the
particular
venire
that
the
jury
was
stricken
from.
mr.
jones
applied
the
case
and
does
know
exact
words.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
90.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
48
were
put
upon
the
defendant
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
three
of
48.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yet
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
redid
the
list
along
in
--
about
1965.
and
this
grand
jury
contained
a
negro
member.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
was
found
to
be
tainted
but
it
was
used
in
the
selection
process
according
to
the
testimony
that
the
jury
commissioner,
it's
hazy
beyond
this
but
they
say
that
they
did
have
the
old
list
and
they
went
down
it
first
and
first,
they
checked
off
the
names
of
those
who
were
dead
and
those
who
have
moved.
and
this
testimony
by
jury
commissioner
saying,
“but
we
didn't
use
that
then.
we
then
went
on
to
the
tax
digest
and
went
on
the
tax
digest.”
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
directly
from
the
old
tainted
list,
but
the
old
tainted
list
was
used,
i
believe
the
record
will
dispose
this
[voice
overlap]
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
state
may
do
that
within
eight
months.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
now,
under
georgia
law,
the
requirements
for
petit
and
grand
jury
duty
are
that
a
man
be
intelligent
and
experienced
and
upright.
now,
the
record
discloses
when
the
jury
commissioners
wrapped
as
to
whether
or
not
they
give
intelligence
test
or
any
other
sources
of
test,
of
course
the
jury
commissioners
didn't
do
that.
the
opportunity
for
discretion,
the
same
kind
of
discretion
that
was
condemned
generally
in
united
states
versus
--
in
mississippi
versus
united
states
--
united
states
versus
mississippi
and
louisiana
versus
united
states.
same
kind
of
discretion
that
was
existed
in
davis
versus
schnell,
alabama,
regarding
voter
cases
exists
pretty
much
in
the
jury
statutes
in
georgia
and
in
other
southern
jury
statutes
also.
here,
we
have
an
instance
where
there's
a
requirement
by
statute
that
came
into
existence
in
1894
that
racial
data
be
included
and
really
thrust
under
the
noses
of
the
jury
commissioners.
beyond
that,
they
then
have
subjective
test
which
they
must
adopt
and
apply
to
these
prospective
jurors.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right
and
perhaps
the
word
experience,
that's
the
additional
word
for
grand
juror
but
you
don't
have
--
the
amount
of
the
experience
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
then
you've
got
the
question
of
experience
in
what
or
you
know
just
what
does
this
mean?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
really
not
certain,
but
it
is
--
we
didn't
go
into
that
question
and
make
pending
of
the
law
so
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
quite
a
few
in
the
south.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
test
like
or
akin
to
that,
they
do.
good
character,
in
alabama
for
instance,
you
have
to
be
able
to
--
you
have
to
be
able
to
read,
write
or
understanding
which
language
or
there's
an
exception
that
you
can
be
a
freeholder
or
a
householder,
which
under
the
state
definition,
a
householder
is
almost
anybody.
you
have
to
have
a
good
character
in
most
of
the
states,
but
there
is
an
ordinary
character
requirement
in
the
states.
now
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
and
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
and
especially
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
those
of
us
who
talk
constantly,
--
let
me
phrase
it
this
way,
two
thirds
of
the
negro
people
in
the
united
states
who
live
outside
of
the
south
were
born
and
reared
in
the
south.
their
conception
of
justice
came
from
the
courthouse
and
the
county
where
they
were
born
and
reared.
and
many
of
the
complaints
and
plenty
of
crimes
that
we
hear
today,
i
think
come
from
a
background
of
experience
that
says
when
somebody
like
me
for
instance
might
say,
take
your
struggle
out
of
the
streets
into
the
courts
and
the
answer
comes
up,
“that's
where
the
sheriff
was.
that's
where
i
saw
someone
convicted
and
go
off
to
jail.”
in
this
particular
instance,
we
have
a
statute
which
is
as
condemnable
as
in
the
hamilton
case
coming
out
of
alabama,
a
contempt
conviction.
the
use
of
monolithic
titles,
we've
got
the
same
sort
of
case.
you've
got
the
johnson
case
on
segregation
in
the
courtroom.
you've
got
the
same
sort
of
case
that
existed
in
ham
with
respect
to
the
use
of
racial
records
and
racial
designations.
and
much
of
what
i'm
talking
about
now
has
very
little
to
do
with
a
particular
fairness
of
the
particular
trials
of
these
two
petitioners.
but
what
it
does
have
to
do
with
is
as
under
map,
the
basic
appearance
of
fairness
of
the
system
of
justice.
and
whenever
we
do
have
racial
designations
and
racial
restrictions
on
the
face
of
relating
to
the
system
of
justice
that
we
have,
we
automatically
bring
that
system
into
question.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there's
not
in
this
case
either.
there
is
no
racial
designation
in
this
case
on
the
cards
that
are
drawn.
the
cards
are
not
different
colors
as
they
were
in
avery.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
avery,
the
slips
were
yellow
and
white
slips
that
were
drawn
out
by
the
judge.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
this
sense,
they're
yellow
and
white
tax
returns.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
doesn't
exist
on
the
cards.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
only
place
where
you
could
have
discrimination
based
on
the
segregation
at
tax
digest
would
be
at
the
first
instance
where
the
names
are
selected
by
the
jury
commissioners.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
we
have
some
varied
estimates.
we
have
a
reasonable
guess
of
25%
by
a
jury
commissioner.
he
also
testified
that
he
could
go
as
high
as
80%
or
90%,
i
guess
that
high,
80%
i
think
was
stable.
we
have
a
total
estimate
and
again,
estimate
and
not
the
exact
figures
of
names
of
the
box.
it
ranges
from
500
to
600
names
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
total
number
in
the
array
but
as
far
as
a
racial
breakdown
of
the
array
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
a
reasonable
or
rough
estimate
of
that.
i
think
from
the
record,
they--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
would
take
the
swain
case
and
draw
from
that
the
legal
conclusion
that
the
petitioners
here
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
of
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
petit
and
grand
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
suppose
to.
the
42%
figure
of
eligibility
which
is
the
lowest
figure
we
have
even
if
negroes
are
lesser
on
the
tax
digest,
we
would
contend
that
that
burden
of
proof
fell
to
the
state
on
the
percentage
figure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
not
the
question
here
but
i
would
think
so
in
another
case
but
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
because
in
the
first
place
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that
the
state
didn't
come
back
with
any
figures
of
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
we
don't
really
think
that
that's
the
evidence
and
certainly
under
the
fifth
circuit
case,
the
scott
versus
walker,
the
recent
cases.
this
--
the
state
has
within
its
control,
racial
figures
regarding
everybody
in
that
county
just
about
that
pays
taxes.
just
a
rough
guesses
or
estimates
of
this
nature
just
don't
jive
with
the
whole
history
of
the
county
and
in
fact
the
first
negroes
served
in
our
grand
jury
with
this.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
jones
might
go
into
that
more
as
to
what
they
went
through
down
in
the
county
and
he'll
speak
right
now
if
that's
alright
and
i'll
reserve
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
last
statement
regarding
the
number
of
people
that
will
be
automatically
released
in
the
event
the
court
reverses
on
the
question
of
tax
digest
recall
for
page
10
of
the
brief
in
the
gideon
case,
the
statement
or
decision
referring
to
the
present
case
of
retroactive
to
allow
over
5,000
hardened
criminals
in
florida
to
be
set
free.
our
only
response
--
that
was
in
the
gideon
case
with
the
state
contended
there
in
brief.
here,
the
state
contends
that
we're
going
to
turn
loose
over
4,000
negro
prisoners
from
the
state
penitentiaries
in
the
event
of
a
reversal
here.
that
argument
was
not
successful
in
the
gideon
case
where
(inaudible)
had
been
a
specific
case
which
was
approved
with
the
law
of
that
case
until
the
gideon
case
and
our
response
to
that
last
contention
is
that
if
they're
in
jail
wrongfully,
they
ought
to
be
out.
now,
regarding
the
historical
questions
on
the
statute,
we've
had
historical
research
done
by
many
in
the
field.
there
seems
to
be
a
split
of
opinion
of
--
as
to
exactly
when
the
anti-negro
voter
registration
pushed
--
came
in
the
south
whether
it
was
1896,
1894
exactly
and
what
year
did
it
take
place.
there
is
very
little
with
respect
to
this
particular
statute
which
was
proposed
as
an
amendment
to
the
voter
registration
bill
that
came
along
in
1894.
there
are
no
racial
reference
is
in
the
publications
in
georgia,
the
original
sources
that
we've
looked
to.
the
atlanta
constitution
of
december
8,
1894
on
page
4,
column
3
in
an
editorial,
stated
that
after
it
admits
that
it's
agitated
the
reform,
it
says,
“the
populist
party
dividing
the
bill
as
a
body
for
what
purposes,
we
do
not
know.”
from
some
of
these
purposes
--
that
time
in
georgia,
the
populist
party
was
quite
a
threat.
the
populist
party
had
not
yet
attached
to
itself
the
doctrines
of
racism.
in
georgia
between
1888
and
1903,
there
were
241
negroes
that
were
lynched,
this
is
the
second
state,
second
only
to
mississippi
in
the
south.
the
problems
of
race,
the
problems
of
voting,
the
problems
of
the
rise
of
a
new
political
party
in
the
south
which
was
aligning
the
interest
of
negroes
with
pro
white
fractions
at
that
time.
all
were
en-captured
by
this
legislation
that
was
proposed
to
the
georgia
general
assembly
at
that
time.
i
can't
give
anything
specific
though
with
respect
to
mention
of
race
in
the
publications
that
had
done.
the
bill,
senate
bill
number
130
reports
to
be
retriever
of
the
georgia
statute
requiring
segregation
on
tax
digest.
i
don't
quite
read
it
that
way.
that
statute
says,
it
purports
to
repeal
the
statute
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
several
tax
receivers
or
tax
commissioners
shall
accumulate
such
statistical
information
in
regard
to
taxpayers
of
such
nature
as
they
shall
deem
to
be
a
benefit
to
the
state
revenue
commissioner.
so
it
does
reveal
the
statute
and
then
goes
on
to
talk
about
statistical
information
and
the
compilation
of
statistical
data.
referring
to
statements
made
regarding
the
use
of
the
old
list,
in
the
compilation
of
the
new
list,
as
the
old
condemned
jury
list,
in
the
record
in
case
number
650
on
page
28,
has
contained
the
statement
that
they
did
use
the
old
list
to
go
through
it
then
they
got
the
--
and
then
used
the
tax
digest
also.
on
this
page
28
reference
i'm
talking
about
now
is
--
solicitor
hand
asked
the
question,
“were
you
present
when
the
jury
list
was
revised
in
february
1965?”
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
revisions
of
the
list
of
course
and
an
actual
throwing
out
of
the
old
list,
it
was
started
anew
from
scratch.
he
--
and
one
of
the
references
is
that
there
is
a
denial
that
the
old
list
was
actually
used.
they
just
said
they
went
through
it
and
checked
of
the
names
and
then
they
came
back
and
i
really
don't
know
what
the
purpose
of
going
through
it
were
if
they
didn't
use
--
they
seem
reports
that
they
didn't.
now,
in
the
record
on
page
48
of
253
under
examination
by
mr.
jones
of
the
city
clerk
tax
collector,
let's
see.
the
statement
is
made
there,
what
record
have
you
make
use
in
making
this
jury
list.
well,
we
used
the
old
list
and
of
course
we
used
the
digest.
you
used
the
old
list
and
the
digest
and
that
was
all
that
you
did
used?
your
honor,
i
submit
the
counsel
is
leading
the
witness
again
and
that's
typically
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
it's
mentioned
in
the
brief,
but
the
law
itself
was
not
contained
in
brief.
i
do
have
a
copy
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
is
the
photocopy
of
senate
bill
number
130
as
passed
in
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
it
is.
this
would
be
the
acts
for
1966.
regarding
the
statistical
breakdown
of
the
number
of
names
there,
we
do
have
the
500
to
600
names
we
do
in
one
instance
have
90
names
drawn
out
of
the
box
apparently
at
random.
we
have
the
names
of
three
negroes
being
drawn
there.
we
have
90,
the
second
time
being
drawn
at
random
apparently
from
the
box.
we
have
seven
names
there
and
no
statistical
studies
were
prepared
for
this
court.
of
course,
we
would
offer
to
have
such
studies
prepared
in
light
of
the
finkelstein
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
based
on
bernoulli's
test
and
laws
of
probability.
if
the
court
so
desired,
we'd
be
happy
to
submit
them
to
the
court
in
a
separate
memorandum
in
a
later
time.
the
fifth
circuit
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
did
call
forward
seven
cases
to
be
argued
and
back
before
the
fifth
circuit
of
which
brooks
versus
beto
was
one
and
davis
versus
davis
governor
was
another.
also
rabinowitz
versus
united
states
was
argued
back
at
that
time.
the
rabinowitz
case
as
i
understand
with
regarding
discretionary
questions
and
the
question
of
the
use
of
discretion
by
federal
jury
commissioners,
says
that
those
federal
standards
are
maximum
standards.
you
can
oppose
other
standards
over
the
able
to
read,
write
and
understand
the
english
language
provisions.
as
i
understand
the
thrust
of
these
cases,
it
is
somewhat
difficult.
we
had
the
case
of
billingsley
versus
clayton
there.
we
attempted
to
bring
that
to
this
court,
the
cert
was
denied.
in
order
to
review
it
along
this
field
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
i
think
the
most
of
the
field
--
the
circuit
most
concerned
with
the
problem.
as
i
understand
the
thrust
of
these
cases,
it
is
the
jury
commissioners
must
be
aware
of
the
racial
makeup
of
the
entire
community
in
which
they
operate
and
they
must
be
aware
of
this
in
order
to
find
a
cross
section
as
to
the
--
and
the
cross
section
is
what
is
required
--
it's
required
from
that
list
and
as
i
understand
the
swain
case,
it's
the
list
that
you've
got
to
have.
we
can
prove
the
list
pretty
well
statistically
by
taking
the
number
of
names
drawn
at
random
from
it
and
moving
right
straight
down
to
the
racial
breakdown
that
we
have.
now,
the
statement
that
was
made
an
argument,
i
do
want
to
question
one
statement
about
the
jury
commissioners
themselves.
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
these
jury
commissioners
knew
about
it
personally
that
was
put
on
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
jury
commissioners
hardly
seem
to
know
very
much
about
anything
much
that
was
going
on
there.
the
percentage
figure
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier
with
mr.
justice
fortas
under
the
cross-examination
by
mr.
hand,
he
said,
“mr.
grovin
(ph)
this
is
just
a
wild
guess
by
you.”
“yes
sir.”
could
it
be
as
high
as
80%
or
60%?”
“well,
it
could
possibly
be
different.
you
just
don't
really
know,
do
you?”
“i
don't
know.”
“you
don't
know
what
the
percentages,
do
you?”
“no,
i'm
not
sure.”
that's
page
25
of
the
record
in
650.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
six,
all
white.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
three.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
generally
out
as
the
argument
not
as
the
fact
that
the
jury
commissioners
did
testify
that
in
their
particular
areas,
they
knew
folks
and
they
took
them
and
they
also
testified
that
their
word
was
pretty
much
law
as
to
who
they
would
take
now
or
temporary.
if
they
recommended
somebody
to
the
whole
commission,
the
whole
commission
would
say,
yes,
we
will
go
ahead
and
take
them.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
was
talking
about
the
case
of
brooks
versus
beto
and
this
is
one
of
the
seven
cases
argued
en
banc
on
december
the
16,
1965.
as
i
see
the
thrust
of
those
cases,
it
is
that
the
jury
commissioner
does
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
community
and
he
is
the
state
official
and
neither
--
i
really
haven't
read
these
cases
you
know
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
and
this
is
recollection
but
in
this
case
or
in
scott
versus
walker
or
davis
versus
davis
governor,
these
were
all
in
that
set,
a
jury
commissioner
came
on
much
as
in
this
case
and
had
access
to
racial
records
there
in
the
county.
the
jurors
names
weren't
drawn
from
those
records,
but
he
had
access
to
the
records,
yet
he
didn't
seem
to
know
anything
about
the
records.
he
couldn't
testify
as
to
who
is
a
negro
and
who
is
not
a
negro.
and
of
course
there
are
difficult
problems
for
plaintiffs
in
civil
actions
or
the
defendants
in
criminal
actions
in
the
techniques
approved
here.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
comment
went
to
that
but
the
jury
commissioner
himself
should
have
knowledge
of
this
and
i
think
there
is
a
thrust
in
those
cases
that
the
jury
commissioner
should
have
knowledge
of
the
entire
community,
about
individual
jurors,
though
i
don't
recall
that,
it
could
be
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
i
would
go
about
selecting
the
juries
is
totally
different
but
we
will
do
it
anyway.
so
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
difficult
in
a
small
county,
a
rural
county
of
this
nature,
for
them
not
to
have
some
knowledge
anyway.
people
work
on
the
farm.
if
your
jury
commissioner
happens
to
have
a
store
that
has
a
charge
business,
he
pretty
well
knows
who
isn't
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
do
i
think
that
they
should
have
that
knowledge?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
at
the
time
of
selection.
i
think
the
knowledge
should
come
from
some
sort
of
a
list.
if
it
comes
from
a
list,
it
ought
to
come
in
a
random
selection
just
straight
down
the
line.
now
as
far
as
techniques
and
modes
of
proof
at
a
later
time
that
you
might
have
in
a
case,
in
a
city
like
birmingham
or
a
city
like
atlanta
where
you
have
a
very
large
population,
the
problem
of
proof
is
just
a
tremendous
problem
and
it
could
very
well
be
that
there
is
--
that
there
might
be
some
record
for
that
purpose
at
some
place
but
i
don't
think
the
jury
commissioner
should
have
that
as
a
consideration
in
their
mind
certainly
not
by
state
law
and
certainly
not
tacked
on
in
a
judicial
system
such
as
we
have
where
it's
just
thrust
at
them.
it's
like
the
andersen
case.
this
maybe
told
to
the
jury
commissioner,
it's
almost
like
saying
to
him,
this
is
a
relevant
consideration
somehow.
if
the
counsel
on
both
sides
are
trying
to
find
out
why
we've
got
segregated
tax
digest
to
begin
with
and
we
don't
know
then
what
in
the
world
would
a
jury
commissioner
think.
there
must
be
some
reason.
there's
a
reason
for
everything.
i
suppose
ordinary
man
think
and
that
reason
must
be
the
racial
distinction.
to
conclude,
we
would
simply
say
this,
a
jury
was
cast
upon
these
defendants.
that
jury
came
from
fluted
wellspring.
we
didn't
--
we
know
that
over
a
period
of
years,
this
court
has
condemned
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
juries.
we
also
know
that
for
period
of
years,
negroes
continued
to
be
excluded
from
juries
in
the
south.
the
remedy
that
we
propose
under
this
case
is
that
the
state
was
given
eight
months
to
try
these
defendants
fairly.
the
conviction
is
unconstitutional
based
first
on
the
tax
digest
segregation
question
as
a
matter
of
law.
secondly,
the
record
discloses
systematic
exclusion
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
state
under
the
law
did
nothing,
the
state
under
the
facts
did
nothing
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
of
georgia
and
any
other
jurisdiction
which
excludes
negroes
from
jury
as
a
matter
of
practice
should
be
advised
that
you
try
them
fairly
and
rapidly
or
they'll
go
free.
we
think
that
these
defendants
should
now
be
cast
out
of
jail.
thank
you
sir.
