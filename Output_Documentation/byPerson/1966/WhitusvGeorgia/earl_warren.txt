did

--
chief

does

chief

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
select
this
--
these
that
are
put
upon
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
48,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
are
they
--
how
are
they
arranged
--
how
are
the
names
arranged
on
this
list
of
90?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
--
are
there
any
restrictions
on
the
manner
on
which
the
judge
draws
this
book?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean,
does
he
have
to
do
it
by
lot
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
does
–
would
he
have
the
right
for
instance
to
reach
in
the
box
and
draw
out
joe
jones
and
say,
“well,
i'll
take
another
one
instead
of
him
and
draw
somebody
else”
until
he
gets
who
he
wants
or--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record
--
that
law
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
all
counties
have
the
same
method
of
drawing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
all
do
it
in
accordance
with
a
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
2,200
includes
men,
women
and
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
2,124,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
over
21--
chief
justice
earl
warren
excuse
me.
i
didn't
hear
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
you
put
great
reliance
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
small
county
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
these
commissioners
could
be
presumed
to
know
the
people
they
recommended
because
one
would
know
most
of
the
people
in
the
county.
i
suppose
the
same
system
works
this
way
in
atlanta
which
is
a
big
city.
would
you
say
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
system
there
would
be
different
than
any
of
your
little
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
statute
had
been
changed
in
some
respects.
are
they
--
are
the
tax
records
still
segregated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that
changed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1966.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
but
they
weren't
at
the
time
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
jury
was
drawn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
mr.
leverett,
why
these
tax
records
were
segregated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
been
looking
at
the
transcript,
and
i'm
reading
the
testimony
of
your
tax
receiver
and
as
i
read
it,
i
understand
that
when
they
changed
the
system
of
having
white
and
yellow
tags
and
having
both
white
and
colored,
use
the
same
colored
cards
that
they
then
went
to
the
practice
of
marking
a
“c”
on
each
one
of
them
for
the
colored
and
a
“w”
on
the
white.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
campbell
who
is
the
tax
receiver.
he
maintains
the
tax
records
he
says.
before
the
taxes,
i
put
this
tax
digest
to
taxpayers
required
to
come
to
your
office
and
make
return
and
the
it
goes
on
and
tells
how
--
this
year,
they've
changed
this
so
they
no
longer
use
yellow
cards
for
the
negro
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
what's
that
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
they
start
of
in
this
manner?
i
don't
know
what
they
do
later
but
if
they
start
with
this
“c”
and
“w”
why
did
they
do
it?
