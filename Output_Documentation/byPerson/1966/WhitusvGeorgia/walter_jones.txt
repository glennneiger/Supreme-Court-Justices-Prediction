mr.
walter
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
been
in
this
case
since
1959.
this
case
was
sent
back
to
the
state
of
georgia
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
with
the
express
mandate
to
try
it
before
a
constitutionally
composed
jury.
we
have
submitted
to
this
court
the
record
which
we
obtained
in
our
first
challenge
to
the
array
of
grand
jurors
and
in
our
first
challenge
to
the
array
of
petit
jurors.
our
state
of
last
night
and
read
that
record
myself
and
--
mr.
walter
jones
yes
sir,
my
challenge
after
the--
mr.
walter
jones
yes,
after
it
was
remanded.
this
was
first
remanded
and
they
said
that
i
did
not
raise
the
point
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
i
did
not
have
to
--
i
would
make
a
(inaudible)
if
i
did.
mr.
walter
jones
i
have
never
read
such
a
shameful
record
in
my
life
and
the
solicitor
had
is
on
my
right
by
six
jury
commissioners
appointed
by
a
judge
in
the
state
of
georgia.
one
of
them
didn't
remember
where
they
met.
one
didn't
remember
where
he
was
appointed.
one
didn't
remember
what
year
he
was
appointed.
one
did
remember
what
(inaudible)
met
and
what
(inaudible)
met
and
we
attempted
and
we
had
to
call
the
witnesses
to
get
all
the
facts
possible
but
i
ask
and
petition
this
court
for
ten
minutes
just
to
point
out
this
one
fact.
in
1962,
the
state
of
georgia
filed
a
brief
with
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
although
they
did
not
make
an
admission
in
judicio,
they
did
not
dispute
that
the
jury
or
jurors
in
mitchell
county
were
unconstitutionally
composed.
that
was
in
august
of
1962
and
yet
no
attempt
was
made
by
mitchell
county
to
correct
that
situation
down
to
february
of
1965.
how
many
men
have
been
tried
and
how
many
convicted
by
unconstitutionally
composed
juries,
grand
juries
during
that
interim,
i
do
not
know
and
i'm
glad
i
don't
because
i
can
sleep
better
at
night.
but
nevertheless,
i
think
it
shows
more
or
less
that
this
attempt
in
february
of
1965
was
a
deliberate
inclusion
by
the
jury
commissioners
to
satisfy
in
some
remote
manner,
the
mandates
of
this
court
or
the
requirements
of
this
court
as
to
the
constitutional
requirements,
as
to
grand
and
petit
juries.
and
i
see
that
our
lunch
hour
draws
near,
but
i
will
say
this.
i
will
lay
the
strength
of
my
case
and
the
strength
of
everything
that
i
have
done
on
a
court
appointed
case
on
the
record
that
we
sent
to
this
court
on
the
challenge
to
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
in
april
of
1965.
in
the
vow
of
mitchell
county,
i
believe
i
will
have
at
point
destroyed
or
in
some
way
give
it
up.
i
thank
you
for
giving
me
your
attention.
