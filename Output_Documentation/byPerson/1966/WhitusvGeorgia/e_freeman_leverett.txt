mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
or
two
things
--mr.
justice
fortas,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
condemn
the
use
of
the
tax
digest
in
its
decision.
its
decision
was
based
upon
the
traditional
showing
that
was
made,
the
fact
that
the
negroes
constituted
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population
and
the
fact
that
none
had
ever
served.
primarily,
the
fifth
circuit's
determination
was
based
upon
a
concession
or
what
was
tantamount
to
a
concession
in
the
brief
of
the
state
which
said,
“we
do
n
to
dispute
the
issue
of
discrimination
but
we
rely
upon
the
doctrine
of
waiver."
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“construing
fay
versus
noia
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
situation
on
the
southern
community,
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
waiver
under
these
circumstances.
well
actually,
one
point
that
was
brought
out
by
mr.
morgan
that
southern
states
are
not
the
only
jurisdictions
that
have
these
subjective
jury
selection
statutes.
this
horrible
statute
of
alabama
that
he
referred
to,
united
states
has
one
almost
identical
if
his
reading
of
it
was
correct.
that's
28
u.s.c.
a-1861
which
says,
you
must
be
able
to
read,
write
and
understand
the
english
language.
there
is
some
other
language
further
on
in
the
statute
in
dealing
with
an
exemption
or
something
about
experience.
so
southern
states
are
not
the
only
jurisdictions
i'm
sure
that
have
subjective
standards
in
their
jury
selection
statutes.
there
are
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
coming
to
that
your
honor.
there
are
two
stages
to
jury
selection.
the
first
is
selecting
that
is
the
process
of
the
jury
commissioners
meeting
every
two
or
three
years
as
the
court
may
direct.
taking
the
tax
digest,
getting
the
names
from
the
tax
digest
of
those
people
that
own
property
and
pay
taxes
and
that
are
thereby
qualified,
making
up
the
jury
boxes
as
we
call
them.
each
jury
--
there
are
two
jury
boxes,
there's
one
for
the
grand
jury
and
there's
one
for
the
petit
jury.
each
jury
box
is
divided
into
two
compartments,
compartments
numbers
one
and
two.
the
jury
commissioners
select
the
petit
or
the
traverse
jury
box
first.
they
take
the
names
of
the
tax
digest.
they
consider
whether
these
particular
people
have
the
qualifications
that
suit
them
for
jury
service.
they
then
prepare
tickets
and
they
put
the
name
of
a
juror
on
that
ticket.
they
put
it
in
compartment
number
one
of
the
grand
jury
box.
from
the
grand
jury
box,
they
then
select
two-fifths,
not
more
than
two-fifths
of
those
names
who
will
also
serve
as
or
rather
from
the
traverse
jury
box,
they
select
a
list
of
group
of
names
of
not
more
than
two-fifths
to
serve
as
grand
jurors
and
they
are
the
most
experienced
and
upright
and
intelligent.
to
be
a
traverse
jury,
you
only
have
to
be
upright
and
intelligent
but
to
be
a
grand
jury,
you
have
to
be
the
most
experienced,
upright
and
intelligent.
these
names
are
placed
in
the
box.
the
names
are
also
given
to
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
who
records
them
on
the
minutes
of
the
court
so
that
there
is
a
permanent
record
of
who
is
in
the
jury
box
and
who
is
not.
at
the
end
of
each
term
of
court,
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
in
open
court,
draws
the
names
from
the
jury
boxes
for
the
grand
and
petit
juries
for
the
term
of
court
that
will
follow
in
that
particular
circuit
or
that
particular
county.
this
is
a
chance
process.
he
puts
his
hand
down
in
the
box,
he
pulls
it
out,
he
has
not
discretion
to
discard
it,
he
has
to
put
the
name
on
the
list.
and
the
panels,
the
panels
are
made
up
of
12
each.
there
are
36
for
several
juries,
24
of
these
are
used
in
criminal
case
plus
such
additional
other
panels
as
the
court
maybe
necessary
to
make
up
a
traverse
jury
panel.
now,
the
georgia
statute
that's
in
question
here,
we
have
two
positions
with
regard
to
that
statute
which
is
59106
which
says
that
you
go
to
the
tax
digest
on
926307
which
says
that
the
names
of
negroes
will
be
listed
separately
on
the
tax
digest.
we
say
that
that
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
jury
selection
because
of
the
fact
that
this
digests
are
used
at
the
deliberative
stage
of
the
jury
selection
process.
when
the
jury
commissioners
presumably
and
in
fact
if
they
follow
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
most
particularly
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
have
to
investigate
the
background
of
all
the
jurors
including
their
race.
that's
set
out
very
clearly
in
the
recent
decision
in
brooks
versus
beto.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
jury
commissioners
to
investigate
the
race
of
the
jurors
to
be
sure
that
they
don't
effectuate
any
discrimination
because
of
their
lack
of
knowledge
or
familiarity
with
the
total
element
of
the
community.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
origin
of
the
statute
refutes
the
fact
that
there
was
any
discriminatory
purpose.
now,
we
recognize
that
the
ham
case
has
held
in
a
direct
suit
for
injunction,
challenging
a
state
law
that
requires
complete
separation
of
names
on
a
poll
tax
or
tax
record
that
such
statute
would
be
stricken
down.
however,
that
was
made
in
the
context
of
a
case
which
was
a
direct
challenge.
that
is
not
true
here.
there
could
not
be
a
direct
challenge
here
because
the
statute
was
repealed
in
the
1966
general
assembly.
there
was
prior
to
that,
prior
to
1965,
there
was
a
practice
whereby
the
return
sheets
upon
which
the
taxpayer
actually,
each
individual
taxpayer
makes
the
return
of
his
taxes,
they
were
put
on
yellow
for
the
negro
taxpayers
and
white
for
white
taxpayers.
that
practice
was
voluntarily
abandoned
in
the
first
part
of
1965
by
the
state
revenue
department
which
furnishes
these
return
sheets.
now,
the
digest
is
a
consolidation
of
the
returns.
a
return
has
just
one
taxpayer's
name
on
it,
but
the
digest
is
a
consolidation.
it
has
maybe
15
to
20
names
on
it
and
it
is
from
the
digest
that
the
jurors
are
selected.
now,
the
digest
itself
heretofore
has
been
divided
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
would
be
white
or
perhaps
vice
versa
and
the
other
part
would
be
the
negro.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
this
particular
county?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
give
me
the
figures.
27.1%,
our
jury
commissioner
estimated
it
between
25%
and
30%.
that
is
a
matter
of
record.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
total
taxpayers
were
negroes.
he
estimated
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir.
now,
we
can
assume,
but
not
concede
that
the
georgia
statute
would
have
been
declared
on
the
constitutionally
challenge
in
a
direct
suit
but
we
do
not
think
that
that
necessarily
carries
with
it
the
proposition
that
the
jurors
selected
with
reference
to
that
statute
are
thereby
unconstitutionally
constituted.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
that
was
brooks
versus
beto
in
366
f.2d,
i
believe
--
366
f.2d
1.
that's
also
spelled
out
in
davis
versus
davis
in
about
361
f.2d
770.
now
of
course
there
is
some
discussion
that
is
relevant
in
the
rabinowitz
case
involving
federal
juries.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
davis,
mr.
justice
black
is
361
f.2d
770.
our
position
as
far
as
this
disposition
of
this
case
is
that
since
this
involved
the
deliberative
stage
of
jury
selection
that
the
fact
that
the
tax
digest
were
separate,
it
does
not
invalidate
the
panels
that
were
constituted
pursuant
to
that
reference.
if
the
--
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
cassell
case,
this
court
have
said
that
there
is
a
responsibility
on
jury
commissioners
to
investigate
and
to
apprise
themselves
of
all
elements
of
the
community
so
that
they
can
be
sure
that
they
do
not
limit
the
selection
of
jurors
to
people
whom
they
personally
know.
we
submit
that
because
of
the
deliberative
stage
at
which
this
racial
identification
entered
the
picture
that
this
did
not
give
these
jury
commissioners
any
information
that
they
didn't
already
either
have
or
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
imposed
upon
them
to
find
out
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
prior
to
the
fifth
circuit
decision
mr.
justice
fortas
because
the
courts
adjudicated
that,
there's
not
much
we
can
say
where
the
court
has
adjudicated
that
you're
precluded
by
it.
the
case
of
avery
versus
georgia
which
this
court
decided,
and
williams
versus
georgia,
involved
racial
identification
at
the
second
stage
of
the
jury
selection
process
that
is
the
stage
that
by
law
is
intended
to
be
by
chance.
it
is
intended
to
be
unselected
when
the
judge
simply
sticks
his
hand
in
the
aperture
and
box
and
pulls
out
the
ticket
and
hands
it
to
the
clerk.
now,
at
that
stage
racial
identification
could
serve
only
one
purpose
and
that
would
be
discrimination
because
that
is
--
that
selection
is
supposed
to
be
with
that
regard
to
the
individualized
considerations.
as
far
as
the
origin
of
this
statute
this
936307
that's
just
been
repealed,
we
have
set
that
forth
rather
extensively
in
our
brief.
in
elections
held
in
georgia
in
1892
and
1894,
there
were
widespread
charges
of
fraud
both
on
the
standpoint
of
the
populist
party,
the
standpoint
of
the
democratic
party.
an
election
for
congressman
in
1894
in
the
city
of
augusta,
twice
as
many
people
voted
as
were
even
eligible
to
vote
in
that
city.
consequently
during
the
last
months
of
1894,
the
atlanta
newspapers
were
campaigning
vigorously
for
a
voter
registration
law.
georgia
had
no
voter
registration
law
at
that
time
to
ensure
that
people
would
not
be
voting
at
more
than
folding
place
and
being
hold
over
the
county
and
some
over
in
augusta
will
hold
in
from
south
carolina.
governor
northen
addressed
the
legislature
in
october
or
november
of
1894
and
called
for
a
voter
registration
law.
such
an
act
was
introduced.
on
the
same
day
that
the
voter
registration
law
was
introduced,
representative
rawlings
from
i
believe
it
was
washington
county,
introduced
a
law
that
was
reported
by
the
atlanta
constitution
under
by
having
registration
and
elections.
that
was
the
forerunner
of
this
tax
digest
statute.
he
explained
this
to
a
reporter.
unfortunately,
it
was
written
down
in
the
paper
in
his
own
record.
and
he
stated
that
the
practice
in
the
past
had
been
for
negro
property
owners
to
be
listed
on
the
tax
digest
following
their
employer.
apparently,
a
hold
over
from
the
days
of
slavery
when
they
were
simply
listed
under
the
name
of
their
master
as
property
that
that
made
it
difficult
to
find
out
whether
any
given
negro
was
qualified
to
vote
or
not
for
the
reason
that
you
couldn't
locate
him.
you
had
to
know
who
he
worked
for.
he
was
not
listed
alphabetically.
and
since
georgia
law
at
this
time
required
as
a
condition
of
the
right
to
vote
that
a
person
have
paid
all
taxes
that
he
owed,
that
it
was
necessary
always
to
go
to
the
tax
records
to
determine
whether
any
particular
person
was
eligible
to
vote.
now,
the
registration
law
that
was
passed
this
year,
i
hasten
to
add
was
purely
objective.
the
literacy
test
did
not
occur
until
14
years
later
in
1908.
it
was
purely
objective.
it
was
in
every
sentence
was
directed
toward
the
question
of
identification
and
what
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
a
particular
person
was
qualified
to
vote.
the
tax
digest
statute
then
dog
tailed
in
with
the
registration
statute.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
poll
tax
was
not
in
effect
at
this
time.
the
poll
tax
was
not
passed
until
1927.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
27.1%
is
the
actual
figure
that's
on
[voice
overlap]
of
the
total
taxpayers
in
mitchell
county
are
negro,
but
where
there
is
a
thousand
taxpayers,
271
would
be
negro.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
45%
or
42%
it's
in
the
brief
--
45%.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
these
are
ad
valorem
tax
rolls.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
both.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
there
has
been
no
challenge
on
economic
grounds
in
this
case
that
i
point
out.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
decisions
of
this
court
up
to
this
time
have
so
upheld
it.
i
recall
that
there
is
one
i
think
that
explicitly
says
that.
it's
not
challenged
in
this
case.
i
anticipate
that
we
will
probably
be
faced
with
that
challenge.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
it's
not.
this
is
direct
appeal.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how's
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
know
sir
(inaudible)
i
read.
i
did
not
undertake
as
counsel
and
i
did
not
make
a
compendium
of
different
state
qualifications.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
was
on
the
digest,
i
mean
on
the
returns
i
believe
wasn't
it
mr.
chief
justice?
and
that
is
not
uniform
in
the
state
of
georgia
if
i
do
recall
something.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
return
sheets
to
where
they
had
reference
to.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
return
sheet
--
the
jury
selection
is
not
made
up
from
there.
the
jury
selection
is
made
up
on
the
digest
which
is
a
consolidation
of
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
suspect
this
simply
as
a
matter
of
identification
for
the
tax
commissioner.
in
my
town
alone,
we
have
three
john
baileys,
two
colored
and
one
white
and
he
did
not
say
why
i
presume
that's
the
reason
that
used
it
but
that
part
of
it
does
not
enter
into
the
jury
selection.
that
is
a
matter
of
the
tax
return
that
the
tax
digest
is
what
is
used
in
jury
selection.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
any
longer.
it's
not
supposed
to
have.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
as
i
recall,
that
is
substantially
all
as
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
and
the
statute
was
never
designed
for
that
purpose.
the
separate
one
released
the
statute
that
required
them
to
be
separate
as
i
have
attempted
to
point
out.
it
was
passed
in
the
context
of
a
voter
registration
act
that
was
aimed
at
both
frauds,
in
which
voters
or
people
would
be
holding
two
horse
wagons.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
had
that
until
1966.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
have
that
until
this
year.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
statute
was
repealed
and
they
are
not
supposed
to
have
any
separation
in
the
digest.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
if
they're
putting
these
low
'cs'
and
'ws'
it's
not
authorized
by
law.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
effect
of
the
reversal
on
this
question
would
mean
that
about
close
to
4900
people
in
the
prison
system
of
georgia
would
be
subject
to
habeas
corpus
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
this
question
can't
be
raised
substantially
so
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
or
two
things
--mr.
justice
fortas,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
condemn
the
use
of
the
tax
digest
in
its
decision.
its
decision
was
based
upon
the
traditional
showing
that
was
made,
the
fact
that
the
negroes
constituted
a
substantial
portion
of
the
population
and
the
fact
that
none
had
ever
served.
primarily,
the
fifth
circuit's
determination
was
based
upon
a
concession
or
what
was
tantamount
to
a
concession
in
the
brief
of
the
state
which
said,
“we
do
n
to
dispute
the
issue
of
discrimination
but
we
rely
upon
the
doctrine
of
waiver."
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“construing
fay
versus
noia
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
situation
on
the
southern
community,
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
waiver
under
these
circumstances.
well
actually,
one
point
that
was
brought
out
by
mr.
morgan
that
southern
states
are
not
the
only
jurisdictions
that
have
these
subjective
jury
selection
statutes.
this
horrible
statute
of
alabama
that
he
referred
to,
united
states
has
one
almost
identical
if
his
reading
of
it
was
correct.
that's
28
u.s.c.
a-1861
which
says,
you
must
be
able
to
read,
write
and
understand
the
english
language.
there
is
some
other
language
further
on
in
the
statute
in
dealing
with
an
exemption
or
something
about
experience.
so
southern
states
are
not
the
only
jurisdictions
i'm
sure
that
have
subjective
standards
in
their
jury
selection
statutes.
there
are
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
coming
to
that
your
honor.
there
are
two
stages
to
jury
selection.
the
first
is
selecting
that
is
the
process
of
the
jury
commissioners
meeting
every
two
or
three
years
as
the
court
may
direct.
taking
the
tax
digest,
getting
the
names
from
the
tax
digest
of
those
people
that
own
property
and
pay
taxes
and
that
are
thereby
qualified,
making
up
the
jury
boxes
as
we
call
them.
each
jury
--
there
are
two
jury
boxes,
there's
one
for
the
grand
jury
and
there's
one
for
the
petit
jury.
each
jury
box
is
divided
into
two
compartments,
compartments
numbers
one
and
two.
the
jury
commissioners
select
the
petit
or
the
traverse
jury
box
first.
they
take
the
names
of
the
tax
digest.
they
consider
whether
these
particular
people
have
the
qualifications
that
suit
them
for
jury
service.
they
then
prepare
tickets
and
they
put
the
name
of
a
juror
on
that
ticket.
they
put
it
in
compartment
number
one
of
the
grand
jury
box.
from
the
grand
jury
box,
they
then
select
two-fifths,
not
more
than
two-fifths
of
those
names
who
will
also
serve
as
or
rather
from
the
traverse
jury
box,
they
select
a
list
of
group
of
names
of
not
more
than
two-fifths
to
serve
as
grand
jurors
and
they
are
the
most
experienced
and
upright
and
intelligent.
to
be
a
traverse
jury,
you
only
have
to
be
upright
and
intelligent
but
to
be
a
grand
jury,
you
have
to
be
the
most
experienced,
upright
and
intelligent.
these
names
are
placed
in
the
box.
the
names
are
also
given
to
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
who
records
them
on
the
minutes
of
the
court
so
that
there
is
a
permanent
record
of
who
is
in
the
jury
box
and
who
is
not.
at
the
end
of
each
term
of
court,
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
in
open
court,
draws
the
names
from
the
jury
boxes
for
the
grand
and
petit
juries
for
the
term
of
court
that
will
follow
in
that
particular
circuit
or
that
particular
county.
this
is
a
chance
process.
he
puts
his
hand
down
in
the
box,
he
pulls
it
out,
he
has
not
discretion
to
discard
it,
he
has
to
put
the
name
on
the
list.
and
the
panels,
the
panels
are
made
up
of
12
each.
there
are
36
for
several
juries,
24
of
these
are
used
in
criminal
case
plus
such
additional
other
panels
as
the
court
maybe
necessary
to
make
up
a
traverse
jury
panel.
now,
the
georgia
statute
that's
in
question
here,
we
have
two
positions
with
regard
to
that
statute
which
is
59106
which
says
that
you
go
to
the
tax
digest
on
926307
which
says
that
the
names
of
negroes
will
be
listed
separately
on
the
tax
digest.
we
say
that
that
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
jury
selection
because
of
the
fact
that
this
digests
are
used
at
the
deliberative
stage
of
the
jury
selection
process.
when
the
jury
commissioners
presumably
and
in
fact
if
they
follow
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
most
particularly
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
have
to
investigate
the
background
of
all
the
jurors
including
their
race.
that's
set
out
very
clearly
in
the
recent
decision
in
brooks
versus
beto.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
jury
commissioners
to
investigate
the
race
of
the
jurors
to
be
sure
that
they
don't
effectuate
any
discrimination
because
of
their
lack
of
knowledge
or
familiarity
with
the
total
element
of
the
community.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
origin
of
the
statute
refutes
the
fact
that
there
was
any
discriminatory
purpose.
now,
we
recognize
that
the
ham
case
has
held
in
a
direct
suit
for
injunction,
challenging
a
state
law
that
requires
complete
separation
of
names
on
a
poll
tax
or
tax
record
that
such
statute
would
be
stricken
down.
however,
that
was
made
in
the
context
of
a
case
which
was
a
direct
challenge.
that
is
not
true
here.
there
could
not
be
a
direct
challenge
here
because
the
statute
was
repealed
in
the
1966
general
assembly.
there
was
prior
to
that,
prior
to
1965,
there
was
a
practice
whereby
the
return
sheets
upon
which
the
taxpayer
actually,
each
individual
taxpayer
makes
the
return
of
his
taxes,
they
were
put
on
yellow
for
the
negro
taxpayers
and
white
for
white
taxpayers.
that
practice
was
voluntarily
abandoned
in
the
first
part
of
1965
by
the
state
revenue
department
which
furnishes
these
return
sheets.
now,
the
digest
is
a
consolidation
of
the
returns.
a
return
has
just
one
taxpayer's
name
on
it,
but
the
digest
is
a
consolidation.
it
has
maybe
15
to
20
names
on
it
and
it
is
from
the
digest
that
the
jurors
are
selected.
now,
the
digest
itself
heretofore
has
been
divided
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
would
be
white
or
perhaps
vice
versa
and
the
other
part
would
be
the
negro.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
this
particular
county?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
give
me
the
figures.
27.1%,
our
jury
commissioner
estimated
it
between
25%
and
30%.
that
is
a
matter
of
record.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
total
taxpayers
were
negroes.
he
estimated
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir.
now,
we
can
assume,
but
not
concede
that
the
georgia
statute
would
have
been
declared
on
the
constitutionally
challenge
in
a
direct
suit
but
we
do
not
think
that
that
necessarily
carries
with
it
the
proposition
that
the
jurors
selected
with
reference
to
that
statute
are
thereby
unconstitutionally
constituted.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
that
was
brooks
versus
beto
in
366
f.2d,
i
believe
--
366
f.2d
1.
that's
also
spelled
out
in
davis
versus
davis
in
about
361
f.2d
770.
now
of
course
there
is
some
discussion
that
is
relevant
in
the
rabinowitz
case
involving
federal
juries.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
davis,
mr.
justice
black
is
361
f.2d
770.
our
position
as
far
as
this
disposition
of
this
case
is
that
since
this
involved
the
deliberative
stage
of
jury
selection
that
the
fact
that
the
tax
digest
were
separate,
it
does
not
invalidate
the
panels
that
were
constituted
pursuant
to
that
reference.
if
the
--
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
cassell
case,
this
court
have
said
that
there
is
a
responsibility
on
jury
commissioners
to
investigate
and
to
apprise
themselves
of
all
elements
of
the
community
so
that
they
can
be
sure
that
they
do
not
limit
the
selection
of
jurors
to
people
whom
they
personally
know.
we
submit
that
because
of
the
deliberative
stage
at
which
this
racial
identification
entered
the
picture
that
this
did
not
give
these
jury
commissioners
any
information
that
they
didn't
already
either
have
or
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
imposed
upon
them
to
find
out
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
prior
to
the
fifth
circuit
decision
mr.
justice
fortas
because
the
courts
adjudicated
that,
there's
not
much
we
can
say
where
the
court
has
adjudicated
that
you're
precluded
by
it.
the
case
of
avery
versus
georgia
which
this
court
decided,
and
williams
versus
georgia,
involved
racial
identification
at
the
second
stage
of
the
jury
selection
process
that
is
the
stage
that
by
law
is
intended
to
be
by
chance.
it
is
intended
to
be
unselected
when
the
judge
simply
sticks
his
hand
in
the
aperture
and
box
and
pulls
out
the
ticket
and
hands
it
to
the
clerk.
now,
at
that
stage
racial
identification
could
serve
only
one
purpose
and
that
would
be
discrimination
because
that
is
--
that
selection
is
supposed
to
be
with
that
regard
to
the
individualized
considerations.
as
far
as
the
origin
of
this
statute
this
936307
that's
just
been
repealed,
we
have
set
that
forth
rather
extensively
in
our
brief.
in
elections
held
in
georgia
in
1892
and
1894,
there
were
widespread
charges
of
fraud
both
on
the
standpoint
of
the
populist
party,
the
standpoint
of
the
democratic
party.
an
election
for
congressman
in
1894
in
the
city
of
augusta,
twice
as
many
people
voted
as
were
even
eligible
to
vote
in
that
city.
consequently
during
the
last
months
of
1894,
the
atlanta
newspapers
were
campaigning
vigorously
for
a
voter
registration
law.
georgia
had
no
voter
registration
law
at
that
time
to
ensure
that
people
would
not
be
voting
at
more
than
folding
place
and
being
hold
over
the
county
and
some
over
in
augusta
will
hold
in
from
south
carolina.
governor
northen
addressed
the
legislature
in
october
or
november
of
1894
and
called
for
a
voter
registration
law.
such
an
act
was
introduced.
on
the
same
day
that
the
voter
registration
law
was
introduced,
representative
rawlings
from
i
believe
it
was
washington
county,
introduced
a
law
that
was
reported
by
the
atlanta
constitution
under
by
having
registration
and
elections.
that
was
the
forerunner
of
this
tax
digest
statute.
he
explained
this
to
a
reporter.
unfortunately,
it
was
written
down
in
the
paper
in
his
own
record.
and
he
stated
that
the
practice
in
the
past
had
been
for
negro
property
owners
to
be
listed
on
the
tax
digest
following
their
employer.
apparently,
a
hold
over
from
the
days
of
slavery
when
they
were
simply
listed
under
the
name
of
their
master
as
property
that
that
made
it
difficult
to
find
out
whether
any
given
negro
was
qualified
to
vote
or
not
for
the
reason
that
you
couldn't
locate
him.
you
had
to
know
who
he
worked
for.
he
was
not
listed
alphabetically.
and
since
georgia
law
at
this
time
required
as
a
condition
of
the
right
to
vote
that
a
person
have
paid
all
taxes
that
he
owed,
that
it
was
necessary
always
to
go
to
the
tax
records
to
determine
whether
any
particular
person
was
eligible
to
vote.
now,
the
registration
law
that
was
passed
this
year,
i
hasten
to
add
was
purely
objective.
the
literacy
test
did
not
occur
until
14
years
later
in
1908.
it
was
purely
objective.
it
was
in
every
sentence
was
directed
toward
the
question
of
identification
and
what
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
a
particular
person
was
qualified
to
vote.
the
tax
digest
statute
then
dog
tailed
in
with
the
registration
statute.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
poll
tax
was
not
in
effect
at
this
time.
the
poll
tax
was
not
passed
until
1927.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
27.1%
is
the
actual
figure
that's
on
[voice
overlap]
of
the
total
taxpayers
in
mitchell
county
are
negro,
but
where
there
is
a
thousand
taxpayers,
271
would
be
negro.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
45%
or
42%
it's
in
the
brief
--
45%.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
these
are
ad
valorem
tax
rolls.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
both.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
there
has
been
no
challenge
on
economic
grounds
in
this
case
that
i
point
out.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
decisions
of
this
court
up
to
this
time
have
so
upheld
it.
i
recall
that
there
is
one
i
think
that
explicitly
says
that.
it's
not
challenged
in
this
case.
i
anticipate
that
we
will
probably
be
faced
with
that
challenge.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
it's
not.
this
is
direct
appeal.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how's
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
know
sir
(inaudible)
i
read.
i
did
not
undertake
as
counsel
and
i
did
not
make
a
compendium
of
different
state
qualifications.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
was
on
the
digest,
i
mean
on
the
returns
i
believe
wasn't
it
mr.
chief
justice?
and
that
is
not
uniform
in
the
state
of
georgia
if
i
do
recall
something.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
return
sheets
to
where
they
had
reference
to.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
return
sheet
--
the
jury
selection
is
not
made
up
from
there.
the
jury
selection
is
made
up
on
the
digest
which
is
a
consolidation
of
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
suspect
this
simply
as
a
matter
of
identification
for
the
tax
commissioner.
in
my
town
alone,
we
have
three
john
baileys,
two
colored
and
one
white
and
he
did
not
say
why
i
presume
that's
the
reason
that
used
it
but
that
part
of
it
does
not
enter
into
the
jury
selection.
that
is
a
matter
of
the
tax
return
that
the
tax
digest
is
what
is
used
in
jury
selection.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
any
longer.
it's
not
supposed
to
have.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
as
i
recall,
that
is
substantially
all
as
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
and
the
statute
was
never
designed
for
that
purpose.
the
separate
one
released
the
statute
that
required
them
to
be
separate
as
i
have
attempted
to
point
out.
it
was
passed
in
the
context
of
a
voter
registration
act
that
was
aimed
at
both
frauds,
in
which
voters
or
people
would
be
holding
two
horse
wagons.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
had
that
until
1966.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
have
that
until
this
year.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
statute
was
repealed
and
they
are
not
supposed
to
have
any
separation
in
the
digest.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
if
they're
putting
these
low
'cs'
and
'ws'
it's
not
authorized
by
law.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
effect
of
the
reversal
on
this
question
would
mean
that
about
close
to
4900
people
in
the
prison
system
of
georgia
would
be
subject
to
habeas
corpus
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
this
question
can't
be
raised
substantially
so
in
the
fifth
circuit.
