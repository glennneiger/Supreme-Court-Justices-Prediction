mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
again,
i
would
like
to
point
out
certain
erroneous
statement
that
i
believe
they
are
predecessors
pertaining
to
these
cases.
in
relation
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
twitty
and
before
going
into
that,
i
would
hasten
to
say
what
transpired
over
the
years
doesn't
really
having
a
thing
to
do
with
this
case.
this
case
is
the
rise
and
fall
upon
the
grand
jury
selection
and
the
crown
jury
selection
that
tried
these
two
men.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
record
in
the
cross-examination
of
mr.
twitty
and
he
was
asked
the
following
question
--
question,
“did
you
ever
make
it
your
--”
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
a
printed
copy
of
your
record,
this
is
a
transcript
of
the
original
trial.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
twitty,
yes
sir
--
cross-examination
--
it
is
only
cross-examination
question
asked
by
me.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
this
is
only
a
grand
jury.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
thirteen,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
did
you
ever
make
it
your
policy
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
in
fact
negroes
on
either
the
petit
jury
or
grand
jury?
mr.
twitty
answered
as
follows,
“i
paid
no
particular
attention
to
that.
i
might
say
or
at
least
didn't
say
who
were
negroes
and
who
were
white
people
even
this
time.”
another
thing
that
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
we
completely
revised
the
grand
jury
box
and
petit
jury
box
as
i
will
refer
it
later
in
my
argument
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
we
change
what
we
did
within
the
system
with
one
exception
and
one
very
important
exception
i
think
and
that
is
certain
directives
which
were
given
by
the
trial
judge
which
i
will
deal
with
later.
the
other
exception
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
counsel's
presentation
of
the
case,
the
record
will
reflect
that
there
were
“at
least
seven
negroes
on
the
petit
jury
panel
not
a
finality
of
seven.”
i
think
this
is
an
important
difference.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
seven
out
of
nine
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
nine.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
lunch
and
recess,
i
was
pointing
out
certain
discrepancies
that
i
believe
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
i
would
like
to
call
out
several
others.
an
additional
a
bit
of
confusion
seem
have
been
that
whether
or
not
there
were
500
to
600
names
in
the
array.
the
correct
thing
is,
there
were
500
to
600
names
in
the
panel,
i
mean,
in
the
jury
boxes
and
not
in
the
array,
that
is
your
distinction.
the
testimony
will
reveal
that
there
are
90
jurors
in
the
array
which
tried
these
particular
cases.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
another--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
those
are
the
particular
48
that
are
what
we
call
cast
upon
the
defendants
from
whence,
12
are
eventually
stricken
--
i
mean
12
remain
to
try
the
particular
case
that
the
state
having
10
strikes,
the
defense
having
20
strikes.
that
is
a
provision
under
your
georgia
law.
another
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
you
mean
the
48
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
you
have
a
list
of
jurors
which
comprises
your
panel.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
list
of
course
was
90,
they're
in
order.
the
first
qualified
48
that
i'm
not
disqualified
you
--
by
way
of
illustration
opposing
death
penalty
or
by
relation
or
by
blood
or
marriage.
the
first
48
are
chosen
with
the
state
having
10
strikes
of
that
indicated
and
the
defense
20
and
from
that
48,
you
will
then
of
course
have
12
qualified
jurors
to
try
a
particular
case.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i'm
not
certain
whether
the
clerk
arranges
them
in
alphabetical
order
or
not.
i'm
not
inclined
to
believe
that
they
are
in
alphabetical
order
though.
i'm
not
fair
to
make
a
statement
in
this
particular
case,
but
i'm
inclined
to
believe
that
it
is
in
alphabetical
order
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
we
have
some
leftover
obviously.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
what
you
do
is
you
start
out
with
this
48
of
course
and
then
the
way
we
do
it
in
this
particular
county
and
in
this
particular
circuit,
the
each
individual
jurors
is
asked
to
stand
then
the
state
either
accepts
or
rejects
that
juror.
if
the
state
accepts
and
then
it
is
cast
upon
the
defense,
the
defense
either
accepts
or
rejecting
--
rejects
the
particular
juror.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
as
soon
as
12
and
then
you
have
like
trial
jury.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
this
is
chosen
by
the
trial
judge
mr.
justice
white.
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
case
of
whether
or
not
it
figures
that
quite
a
number
of
jurors
maybe
disqualified
because
of
relationship
by
which
in
fact
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
he
draws
from
the
jury
box,
that
is
correct.
and
as
has
been
previously
indicated
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
what
i
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no
sir.
between
500
and
600
was
the
best
estimate
that
the
record
reflects.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
drawing
takes
place
in
open
court
in
the
court
room
and
the
sheriff
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
are
present
when
the
judge
draws
this,
as
well
as
anyone
else
that
might
care
to
be
there.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
for
the
entire
panel
of
jurors
that
were
seated
in
a
particular
term
of
court,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
90,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
anyone
that
cares
to
be
present
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
in
this
particular
instance
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
there
was
a
recent
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
wherein
the
selection
was
done
in
the
clerk
side.
the
georgia
law
very
clearly
says
that
it
should
be
done
in
an
open
court
and
that
particular
case
was
reversed
on
that
ground
that
it
was
not
held
in
open
court.
the
drawing
was
not
held
in
open
court.
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
don't
believe
i
follow
your
question.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
he
just
reaches
in
to
the
box.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
jury
box
that
he
just
merely
puts
his
hand
down
and
then
draws
out
a
slip
and
flips
the
slip
and
says
joe
jones,
the
clerk
writes
down
joe
jones'
name
and
that
is
only
the
method.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
think
any
--
i
think
that
the
law
requires
it.
he
draw
them
one
at
a
time
and
not
rejecting
unless
for
some
–
just
deceased,
way
of
illustration,
he
knows
that
someone
is
deceased,
i
think
he
could
very
obviously
cast
him
aside,
but
i
think
that
the
law
requires
and
contemplates
he
shall
draw
them
as
he
comes
to
them.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
neither
i
should
say
that
they're
supposed
to
do
it
in
accordance
with
the
georgia
law
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
well,
whether
this
happened
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
segregated
your
honor
and
it
was
at
a
time
this
one
was
selected
and
i
propose
to
go
into
that
very
briefly
--
little
further
down
my
presentation.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
the
georgia
law
has
been
changed
since
that
time
i
believe
that
would
prohibit
it
in
view
of
this
court's
decisions.
now,
there's
one
other
very
important
on
observation
that
i
would
like
to
make
concerning
the
remarks
made
by
my
brother
at
the
bar
and
that
is,
they
referred
to
the
fact
that
although
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
to
the
jury
commissioner
of
mitchell
county,
georgia,
that
your
juries
are
unconstitutionally
selected
and
the
council
made
great
ado
over
the
fact
that
we
did
not
see
fit
to
revise
until
february,
1965.
i
might
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
final
mandate
of
this
court
was
not
handed
down
until
january,
1965.
in
the
month
proceeding
that
there
was
a
revision,
there
were
no
intervening
trials,
not
intervening
cases
that
any
jury
of
mitchell
county
would
have
had
to
pay
its
own
between
the
time
of
the
final
mandate
of
this
court
actually
was
on
appeal
to
this
court
and
when
we
received
the
final
notice
of
certiorari
in
demand
then
we
immediately
revised
the
next
month.
and
now
if
i
may
in
the
very
brief
time
that
i
have
remaining
go
into
my
argument.
the
respondent
is
well
aware
of
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
hold
and
of
course
whether
it's
been
prior
discrimination
that
--
in
the
selection
of
juries
and
grand
juries
that
a
man
cannot
be
properly
tried
by
constitutionally
selected
jury
where
people
have
been
systematically
excluded.
however,
the
respondent
would
respectfully
called
to
the
court's
attention
that
whereas
here,
prior
discrimination
was
laid
there
and
then
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
that
is
the
very
crux
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
you
have
prior
discrimination.
that
is
admitted
and
it's
not
denied.
and
a
revision
takes
place
--
what
transpired
before
the
revision
is
irrelevant,
cassell
versus
texas.
so
while
this
prior
discrimination
which
has
already
been
adjudicated
may
or
may
not
had
been,
the
court
say
that
it
did.
i
say
to
you
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
now,
what
do
we
have
that
has
a
fair
amount
importance
to
this
court?
what
do
we
have?
we
have
a
fifth
circuit
mandate
that
says,
that
we
have
a
bad
jury
system,
pursue
it
to
that
mandate
and
the
record
will
so
reflect,
the
trial
judge
of
mitchell
superior
court,
called
his
three
commissioners
together
and
says
in
effect,
“look,
the
fifth
circuit
says
you've
got
to
change.
you
have
to
revise
these
boxes
in
which
nobody
is
systematically
included
or
excluded
because
of
their
race,
color,
creed
and
national
origin,
this
took
place.
now
why
did
i
say
so
affirmatively
that
this
takes
place,
because
the
fact
remains,
the
record
reflects
it.
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
there
were
at
least
three
negroes
called
for
grand
jury
service.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
was
not
changed
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
specific
things
in
that
relation.
now--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no
prior
to
the
contrary
your
honor.
we
have
to
have
some
basis
to
go
by,
the
jury
commissioners
do.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no,
i
say
that
this
--
this
is
actually
in
a
small
rural
county
such
as
you're
dealing
with
here
--
really,
whether
they
select
from
a
segregated
tax
digest
or
what
have
you
s
really
in
material
for
this
one
recently
for
no
other
and
that
is
by
their
own
admissions
in
the
record.
they
personally
knew
each
individual
juror
who
was
selected
and
whose
name
was
put
into
this
jury
box.
so
if
they
personally
knew
this
individual
of
necessity,
they
would
have
to
know
his
race.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
there
are
between
18,000
and
20,000
your
honor.
the
jury
commissioners
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
these
are
--
no.
they
are
--
there
are
--
in
this
relation,
i'll
give
you
a
two
statistics.
with
respect
to
the
statistics,
a
census
figures,
show
that
there
are
--
according
to
the
1960
census,
10,206
persons
in
mitchell
county
over
the
age
of
21
years
or
older
as
follows,
4,480
negro
and
5,726
white.
of
these,
white
and
negro
adults
over
21
years
of
age,
there
are
2,124
functionally
illiterate
non-white
in
the
county.
so
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
2,124
functionally,
illiterate
non-white
in
the
county.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
neither
read
nor
write,
understand
the
zero
to
four
years
of
age
with
educational
requirements
coming
within
that
area.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
--
i'll
take
this
from
the
census
bureau
your
honor.
why
they
do
it?
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
it.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
you
mean
the
2,124.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
would
presume
that
it
did
not
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
over
21,
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no,
i
think
the--what
i
was
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no.
what
i
was
leading
up
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
was
that
these
jury
commissioners
come
from
widely,
divergent
sections
of
the
county.
one
of
them
was
a
city
clerk
of
the
city
of
ellen,
georgia
which
was
one
of
the
small
towns
in
the
county
and
the
other
one
was
a
city
clerk
of
camila,
georgia
which
was
another
small
town.
all
other
areas
in
the
county
are
rule
in
nature.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
significant
to
point
out
as
far
as
this
goes
that
the
defense
shows
to
examine
only
three
of
the
six
jury
commissioners.
and
in
the
examination,
they
didn't
show
that
they
have
any
prejudice
bias.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
that
georgia
law
requires
that
the
jury
commissioners
draw
from
the
tax
digest
to
the
--
with
perspective
jurors
from
this
tax
digest.
now,
in
that
relation,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
of
the
total
people
on
these
tax
digests
that
only
27.1%
of
the
total
people
on
the
tax
digest
are
of
the
negro
race.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
if
i
may
say
so.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
look
to
the
proposition
that
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
well,
let
me
answer
you
in
this
way
if
i
may
very
briefly.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
the
method
of
selection
of
jurors
was
bad.
they
said,
the
fact
that
there
had
been
prior
discrimination
was
bad,
it
was
not
what
was
in
the
jury
box
but
what
was
not
in
the
jury
box,
namely
that
there
were
no
negroes
apparently
in
the
jury
boxes
when
this
case
was
first
tried
in
1960.
to
correct
that,
you
obviously
have
to
have
a
change
of
the
contents
of
that
box.
this
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
they
changed
it
by
going
down
the
list
and
not
systematically
excluding
anyone.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
at
this
time,
i
believe
that
it
did.
since
that
time,
the
georgia
law
as
i
previously
indicated
has
been
changed
with
remaining
time
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
each
one
of
this
jurors
or
jury
commissioners
personally
knew
the
person
whom
he
recommended
to
serve
as
a
prospective
juror.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
it
would
be
his
affirmative
duty.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
of
necessity
if
he
personally
knew
him.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
the
exact
point
that
i've
pushed
and
pressed
upon
the
court.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
think
in
a
place
such
as
--
i
don't
think
the
constitutionality
would
be
any
different,
but
i
do
think
that
the
jury
commissioners
in
a
metropolitan
area
such
as
atlanta
would
have
to
have
a
staff
or
themselves
go
out
into
the
field
and
acquaint
themselves
with
the
people
that
they
find
only
tax
digest.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i'm
informed
in
fulton
county,
georgia
that
they
do
have
a
staff
that
are
--
maybe
in
there
but
i
believe
that
that
could
be
a
true
statement
of
fact.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
they
are
not
your
honor
according
to
my
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
1966,
i
believe.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
under
georgia
law,
they
were
required
to
be
segregated
at
the
time
that
this
jury
was
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
again,
i
would
like
to
point
out
certain
erroneous
statement
that
i
believe
they
are
predecessors
pertaining
to
these
cases.
in
relation
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
twitty
and
before
going
into
that,
i
would
hasten
to
say
what
transpired
over
the
years
doesn't
really
having
a
thing
to
do
with
this
case.
this
case
is
the
rise
and
fall
upon
the
grand
jury
selection
and
the
crown
jury
selection
that
tried
these
two
men.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
record
in
the
cross-examination
of
mr.
twitty
and
he
was
asked
the
following
question
--
question,
“did
you
ever
make
it
your
--”
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
a
printed
copy
of
your
record,
this
is
a
transcript
of
the
original
trial.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
twitty,
yes
sir
--
cross-examination
--
it
is
only
cross-examination
question
asked
by
me.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
this
is
only
a
grand
jury.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
thirteen,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
did
you
ever
make
it
your
policy
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
in
fact
negroes
on
either
the
petit
jury
or
grand
jury?
mr.
twitty
answered
as
follows,
“i
paid
no
particular
attention
to
that.
i
might
say
or
at
least
didn't
say
who
were
negroes
and
who
were
white
people
even
this
time.”
another
thing
that
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
we
completely
revised
the
grand
jury
box
and
petit
jury
box
as
i
will
refer
it
later
in
my
argument
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
we
change
what
we
did
within
the
system
with
one
exception
and
one
very
important
exception
i
think
and
that
is
certain
directives
which
were
given
by
the
trial
judge
which
i
will
deal
with
later.
the
other
exception
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
counsel's
presentation
of
the
case,
the
record
will
reflect
that
there
were
“at
least
seven
negroes
on
the
petit
jury
panel
not
a
finality
of
seven.”
i
think
this
is
an
important
difference.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
seven
out
of
nine
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
nine.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
lunch
and
recess,
i
was
pointing
out
certain
discrepancies
that
i
believe
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
i
would
like
to
call
out
several
others.
an
additional
a
bit
of
confusion
seem
have
been
that
whether
or
not
there
were
500
to
600
names
in
the
array.
the
correct
thing
is,
there
were
500
to
600
names
in
the
panel,
i
mean,
in
the
jury
boxes
and
not
in
the
array,
that
is
your
distinction.
the
testimony
will
reveal
that
there
are
90
jurors
in
the
array
which
tried
these
particular
cases.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
another--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
those
are
the
particular
48
that
are
what
we
call
cast
upon
the
defendants
from
whence,
12
are
eventually
stricken
--
i
mean
12
remain
to
try
the
particular
case
that
the
state
having
10
strikes,
the
defense
having
20
strikes.
that
is
a
provision
under
your
georgia
law.
another
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
you
mean
the
48
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
you
have
a
list
of
jurors
which
comprises
your
panel.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
list
of
course
was
90,
they're
in
order.
the
first
qualified
48
that
i'm
not
disqualified
you
--
by
way
of
illustration
opposing
death
penalty
or
by
relation
or
by
blood
or
marriage.
the
first
48
are
chosen
with
the
state
having
10
strikes
of
that
indicated
and
the
defense
20
and
from
that
48,
you
will
then
of
course
have
12
qualified
jurors
to
try
a
particular
case.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i'm
not
certain
whether
the
clerk
arranges
them
in
alphabetical
order
or
not.
i'm
not
inclined
to
believe
that
they
are
in
alphabetical
order
though.
i'm
not
fair
to
make
a
statement
in
this
particular
case,
but
i'm
inclined
to
believe
that
it
is
in
alphabetical
order
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
we
have
some
leftover
obviously.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
what
you
do
is
you
start
out
with
this
48
of
course
and
then
the
way
we
do
it
in
this
particular
county
and
in
this
particular
circuit,
the
each
individual
jurors
is
asked
to
stand
then
the
state
either
accepts
or
rejects
that
juror.
if
the
state
accepts
and
then
it
is
cast
upon
the
defense,
the
defense
either
accepts
or
rejecting
--
rejects
the
particular
juror.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
as
soon
as
12
and
then
you
have
like
trial
jury.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
this
is
chosen
by
the
trial
judge
mr.
justice
white.
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
case
of
whether
or
not
it
figures
that
quite
a
number
of
jurors
maybe
disqualified
because
of
relationship
by
which
in
fact
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
he
draws
from
the
jury
box,
that
is
correct.
and
as
has
been
previously
indicated
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
what
i
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no
sir.
between
500
and
600
was
the
best
estimate
that
the
record
reflects.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
drawing
takes
place
in
open
court
in
the
court
room
and
the
sheriff
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
are
present
when
the
judge
draws
this,
as
well
as
anyone
else
that
might
care
to
be
there.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
for
the
entire
panel
of
jurors
that
were
seated
in
a
particular
term
of
court,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
90,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
anyone
that
cares
to
be
present
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
in
this
particular
instance
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
there
was
a
recent
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
wherein
the
selection
was
done
in
the
clerk
side.
the
georgia
law
very
clearly
says
that
it
should
be
done
in
an
open
court
and
that
particular
case
was
reversed
on
that
ground
that
it
was
not
held
in
open
court.
the
drawing
was
not
held
in
open
court.
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
don't
believe
i
follow
your
question.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
he
just
reaches
in
to
the
box.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
jury
box
that
he
just
merely
puts
his
hand
down
and
then
draws
out
a
slip
and
flips
the
slip
and
says
joe
jones,
the
clerk
writes
down
joe
jones'
name
and
that
is
only
the
method.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
think
any
--
i
think
that
the
law
requires
it.
he
draw
them
one
at
a
time
and
not
rejecting
unless
for
some
–
just
deceased,
way
of
illustration,
he
knows
that
someone
is
deceased,
i
think
he
could
very
obviously
cast
him
aside,
but
i
think
that
the
law
requires
and
contemplates
he
shall
draw
them
as
he
comes
to
them.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
neither
i
should
say
that
they're
supposed
to
do
it
in
accordance
with
the
georgia
law
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
well,
whether
this
happened
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
segregated
your
honor
and
it
was
at
a
time
this
one
was
selected
and
i
propose
to
go
into
that
very
briefly
--
little
further
down
my
presentation.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
the
georgia
law
has
been
changed
since
that
time
i
believe
that
would
prohibit
it
in
view
of
this
court's
decisions.
now,
there's
one
other
very
important
on
observation
that
i
would
like
to
make
concerning
the
remarks
made
by
my
brother
at
the
bar
and
that
is,
they
referred
to
the
fact
that
although
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
to
the
jury
commissioner
of
mitchell
county,
georgia,
that
your
juries
are
unconstitutionally
selected
and
the
council
made
great
ado
over
the
fact
that
we
did
not
see
fit
to
revise
until
february,
1965.
i
might
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
final
mandate
of
this
court
was
not
handed
down
until
january,
1965.
in
the
month
proceeding
that
there
was
a
revision,
there
were
no
intervening
trials,
not
intervening
cases
that
any
jury
of
mitchell
county
would
have
had
to
pay
its
own
between
the
time
of
the
final
mandate
of
this
court
actually
was
on
appeal
to
this
court
and
when
we
received
the
final
notice
of
certiorari
in
demand
then
we
immediately
revised
the
next
month.
and
now
if
i
may
in
the
very
brief
time
that
i
have
remaining
go
into
my
argument.
the
respondent
is
well
aware
of
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
hold
and
of
course
whether
it's
been
prior
discrimination
that
--
in
the
selection
of
juries
and
grand
juries
that
a
man
cannot
be
properly
tried
by
constitutionally
selected
jury
where
people
have
been
systematically
excluded.
however,
the
respondent
would
respectfully
called
to
the
court's
attention
that
whereas
here,
prior
discrimination
was
laid
there
and
then
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
that
is
the
very
crux
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
you
have
prior
discrimination.
that
is
admitted
and
it's
not
denied.
and
a
revision
takes
place
--
what
transpired
before
the
revision
is
irrelevant,
cassell
versus
texas.
so
while
this
prior
discrimination
which
has
already
been
adjudicated
may
or
may
not
had
been,
the
court
say
that
it
did.
i
say
to
you
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
now,
what
do
we
have
that
has
a
fair
amount
importance
to
this
court?
what
do
we
have?
we
have
a
fifth
circuit
mandate
that
says,
that
we
have
a
bad
jury
system,
pursue
it
to
that
mandate
and
the
record
will
so
reflect,
the
trial
judge
of
mitchell
superior
court,
called
his
three
commissioners
together
and
says
in
effect,
“look,
the
fifth
circuit
says
you've
got
to
change.
you
have
to
revise
these
boxes
in
which
nobody
is
systematically
included
or
excluded
because
of
their
race,
color,
creed
and
national
origin,
this
took
place.
now
why
did
i
say
so
affirmatively
that
this
takes
place,
because
the
fact
remains,
the
record
reflects
it.
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
there
were
at
least
three
negroes
called
for
grand
jury
service.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
was
not
changed
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
specific
things
in
that
relation.
now--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no
prior
to
the
contrary
your
honor.
we
have
to
have
some
basis
to
go
by,
the
jury
commissioners
do.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no,
i
say
that
this
--
this
is
actually
in
a
small
rural
county
such
as
you're
dealing
with
here
--
really,
whether
they
select
from
a
segregated
tax
digest
or
what
have
you
s
really
in
material
for
this
one
recently
for
no
other
and
that
is
by
their
own
admissions
in
the
record.
they
personally
knew
each
individual
juror
who
was
selected
and
whose
name
was
put
into
this
jury
box.
so
if
they
personally
knew
this
individual
of
necessity,
they
would
have
to
know
his
race.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
there
are
between
18,000
and
20,000
your
honor.
the
jury
commissioners
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
these
are
--
no.
they
are
--
there
are
--
in
this
relation,
i'll
give
you
a
two
statistics.
with
respect
to
the
statistics,
a
census
figures,
show
that
there
are
--
according
to
the
1960
census,
10,206
persons
in
mitchell
county
over
the
age
of
21
years
or
older
as
follows,
4,480
negro
and
5,726
white.
of
these,
white
and
negro
adults
over
21
years
of
age,
there
are
2,124
functionally
illiterate
non-white
in
the
county.
so
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
2,124
functionally,
illiterate
non-white
in
the
county.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
neither
read
nor
write,
understand
the
zero
to
four
years
of
age
with
educational
requirements
coming
within
that
area.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
--
i'll
take
this
from
the
census
bureau
your
honor.
why
they
do
it?
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
it.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
you
mean
the
2,124.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
would
presume
that
it
did
not
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
over
21,
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no,
i
think
the--what
i
was
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
no.
what
i
was
leading
up
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
was
that
these
jury
commissioners
come
from
widely,
divergent
sections
of
the
county.
one
of
them
was
a
city
clerk
of
the
city
of
ellen,
georgia
which
was
one
of
the
small
towns
in
the
county
and
the
other
one
was
a
city
clerk
of
camila,
georgia
which
was
another
small
town.
all
other
areas
in
the
county
are
rule
in
nature.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
significant
to
point
out
as
far
as
this
goes
that
the
defense
shows
to
examine
only
three
of
the
six
jury
commissioners.
and
in
the
examination,
they
didn't
show
that
they
have
any
prejudice
bias.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
that
georgia
law
requires
that
the
jury
commissioners
draw
from
the
tax
digest
to
the
--
with
perspective
jurors
from
this
tax
digest.
now,
in
that
relation,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
of
the
total
people
on
these
tax
digests
that
only
27.1%
of
the
total
people
on
the
tax
digest
are
of
the
negro
race.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
if
i
may
say
so.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
look
to
the
proposition
that
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
well,
let
me
answer
you
in
this
way
if
i
may
very
briefly.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
the
method
of
selection
of
jurors
was
bad.
they
said,
the
fact
that
there
had
been
prior
discrimination
was
bad,
it
was
not
what
was
in
the
jury
box
but
what
was
not
in
the
jury
box,
namely
that
there
were
no
negroes
apparently
in
the
jury
boxes
when
this
case
was
first
tried
in
1960.
to
correct
that,
you
obviously
have
to
have
a
change
of
the
contents
of
that
box.
this
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
they
changed
it
by
going
down
the
list
and
not
systematically
excluding
anyone.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
at
this
time,
i
believe
that
it
did.
since
that
time,
the
georgia
law
as
i
previously
indicated
has
been
changed
with
remaining
time
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
each
one
of
this
jurors
or
jury
commissioners
personally
knew
the
person
whom
he
recommended
to
serve
as
a
prospective
juror.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
it
would
be
his
affirmative
duty.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
of
necessity
if
he
personally
knew
him.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
the
exact
point
that
i've
pushed
and
pressed
upon
the
court.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
think
in
a
place
such
as
--
i
don't
think
the
constitutionality
would
be
any
different,
but
i
do
think
that
the
jury
commissioners
in
a
metropolitan
area
such
as
atlanta
would
have
to
have
a
staff
or
themselves
go
out
into
the
field
and
acquaint
themselves
with
the
people
that
they
find
only
tax
digest.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i'm
informed
in
fulton
county,
georgia
that
they
do
have
a
staff
that
are
--
maybe
in
there
but
i
believe
that
that
could
be
a
true
statement
of
fact.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
they
are
not
your
honor
according
to
my
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
1966,
i
believe.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
under
georgia
law,
they
were
required
to
be
segregated
at
the
time
that
this
jury
was
--
mr.
fred
b.
hand,
jr.
that
is
correct.
