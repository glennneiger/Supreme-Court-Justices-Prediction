justice
potter
stewart
was
one
of
those
cases
a
habeas
corpus
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
and
you
don't
need
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
in
a
direct
appeal
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
you
see
the
rules
mr.
justice,
require
a
--
the
clerks
are
very
human
people
and
they
operate
under
statutes,
so
they'd
say
“you
can
not
docket
an
appeal
unless
you
have
a
$25
filing
fee,
unless
the
court
orders
the
appeal
to
be
docketed
without
the
prepayment
of
the
$25.”
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
it's
taken
in
good
faith.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
different
language.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
under
2253
that
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
as
required
quite
regardless
of
the
indigency
of
the
petitioner
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
it
says
so?
justice
potter
stewart
or
my
mistake,
it
has
nothing
to
do
--
that
provision
of
the
code
has
nothing
to
do
with
form
of
paupers
bail
none
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
has
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
appeal,
and
it's
equally
applicable
to
a
millionaire
and
to
a
pauper.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven't
got
it
before
me
but
that's
my
recollection.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
in
the
denial
on
the
certificate,
and
you
don't
have
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
all
these
--
these
all
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
habeas
corpus
appeal
in
the
third
circuit,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
go
to
the
issues
now
before
us
really,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no
i
didn't
mean
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
suggesting
that
he
may
not
have
a
merit
