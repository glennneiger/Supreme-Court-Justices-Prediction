justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
o'hern
this
case
i
gather
from
the
--
after
hearing
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
denied
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
probable
cause
issue?
a
district
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
signed
a
probable
cause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
indigent
here
was
denied
leave
to
proceed
in
a
form
of
paupers
on
an
appeal
as
to
which
the
district
court
had
certified
there
was
probable
cause,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
he
denied?
leave
to
proceed
in
a
form
of
paupers
or
denied
and
also
an
appeal
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
why
in
addition
to
denying
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers,
was
there
a
formal
order
would
you
think
that
docket
the
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
withstanding
the
other
standards
except
for
the
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
take
it
if
you're
right
here,
all
that
required
of
us
is
to
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
docket
his
appeal
and
proceed
at
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
he
has
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
the
district
judge
who
heard
the
case
denied
him
relief
but
said
nevertheless
he
has
a
non-frivolous
claim,
is
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
evading,
mr.
o'hern,
do
you
need
to
go
beyond
that
in
this
case?
you
have
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
with
the
district
judge,
and
looking
at
the
statute,
do
you
need
go
beyond
suggesting
that
the
statute
has
to
be
read
in
this
circumstance
with
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
choice
but
to
hear
his
appeal.
certainly
docket
his
appeal,
come
in
and
proceed
in
the
form
of
paupers,
and
you
suggest
also
to
assign
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually,
isn't
your
position
is
that
a
matter
of
permitting
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
that's
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
a
--
since
he
has
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
the
court
of
appeals
must
allow
him
of
right
to
docket
his
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
this
record
that
doesn't
appear
that
the
court
of
appeals
ever
heard
of
this
case,
never
got
beyond
the
clerk's
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
do
we
know
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
with
any
determination
that
it
was
frivolous
in
the
merit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
o'hern,
but
if
you
prevail
and
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
directed
to
docket
the
appeal
as
an
informal
paupers
appeal,
don't
you
suppose
the
third
circuit
on
the
prisoner's
application
would
assign
counsel
without
our
telling
him
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
should
we
reach
the
question
whether
constitutionally
there's
any
compulsion
on
the
third
circuit
to
assign
that
if
at
least
until
we
know
that
they
will
not
assign
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
application
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
where
does
judge
biggs
gets
the
power
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
he
isn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
he
isn't
the
court
is
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
isn't
the
court
is
he?
he's
only
a
member
of
the
court
is
he,
even
though
the
chief
judge.
he's
only
a
single
member
of
the
court
and
nothing
in
that
statute
says
that
single
members
of
court
of
appeals
could
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
one
of
the
panel
of
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
that's
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
take
it
you
point
is
that
since
federal
habeas
looks
to
the
least,
if
he
served
complete
sentence
and
he's
not
been
released
since
then,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
does
this
--
does
the
conviction
on
this
charge
have
any
bearing
of
the
recidivism
to
the
like
and
the
punishments
he's
got
in
this
sentences
he's
now
serving?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
whatever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
they
were
committed
in
pennsylvania.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
you
question
your
honor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
possibly
in
another
state,
not
in
pennsylvania.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that's
correct.
i
didn't
mean
them
to
in
this
argument
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
they're
rather
important
extra
proceedings
aren't
they?
you
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
can
answer
a
motion
to
dismiss.
he
can
file
a
brief
in
support
of
an
argument,
rather
should
not
be
a
dismissal.
the
judges
at
least
have
to
read
it
if
they
don't
hear
oral
argument
that
this
indigent
gets
nothing
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
its
purpose
is
rather
important
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
motion,
there
wasn't
any
motion
here
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
what
he
filed
was
petition,
was
any
notice
by
any
one
given
to
the
state
of
his
filing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
when
he
filed
to
the
circuit
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
ordinarily
happens?
let's
say
he
had
paid
counsel
who
had
filed
an
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
statement
of
probable
cause
based
on
the
trial
judge's
denial
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
what
ordinarily
happens
if
an
appeal
taken
from
that
denial
and
of
course
the
stage
is
for
the
warden
which
i
guess
it's
the
warden
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
respondent
on
the
appeal.
now
who,
under
the
rules,
who
has
the
duty
of
notifying
the
warden,
the
clerk
after
docketing
or
the
appellant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
i
take
it
there's
an
affidavit
or
something
of
service
for
the
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
like
that
was
before
this
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
it
took
its
action
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wanted
to
know
how
we
can
say
this
was
a
docketed
appeal
in
those
circumstances.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
suggests
then
that
without
the
respondent
ever
hearing
about
it,
the
court
of
appeals
can
throw
out
an
appeal
if
it
thinks
that
the
face
of
the
papers
if
was
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
in
that
circumstance,
an
appellant
files
whether
he
has
paid
counsel
or
not,
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
at
least
power
whether
it
derives
from
1915
or
that
of
other
statutes,
power
in
the
court
of
appeals,
sua
sponte
with
the
respondent
never
having
even
heard
that
the
appeal
was
pending
to
examine
the
papers
and
enter
an
order
of
dismissal
without
hearing
the
appellant
for
notice
of
respondent
and
otherwise.
i
gather
you
get
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my,
oh
my,
what
did
congress
said
it
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
a
ticket
of
entry
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
o'hern
this
case
i
gather
from
the
--
after
hearing
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
denied
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
probable
cause
issue?
a
district
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
signed
a
probable
cause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
indigent
here
was
denied
leave
to
proceed
in
a
form
of
paupers
on
an
appeal
as
to
which
the
district
court
had
certified
there
was
probable
cause,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
he
denied?
leave
to
proceed
in
a
form
of
paupers
or
denied
and
also
an
appeal
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
why
in
addition
to
denying
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers,
was
there
a
formal
order
would
you
think
that
docket
