mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
district
attorney.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit,
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
narrowly
stated
the
question
presented
in
the
case
as
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
denying
this
petitioner
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
which
had
discharged
an
order
in
connection
with
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
think
more
broadly
stated
the
question
in
the
case
whether
this
court
and
whether
in
fact
the
federal
system
administration
and
justice,
can
make
a
reality
of
the
emblem
of
the
court
which
is
carved
in
stone
on
the
front
of
the
court,
equal
justice
under
law.
basically,
the
question
which
presents
itself
to
the
court
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
my
opinion,
namely
28
u.s.
code
section
1915,
now
that
section
or
that
statute
provides
basically
the
procedure
or
the
scheme
whereby
indigent
proceedings
may
be
brought
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
it's
a
very
general
statute
and
it
applies
to
any
court
of
the
united
states.
it
says
that
they
may
--
any
court
may
authorize
the
commencement
and
certainly
of
any
suit
without
prepayment
of
fees,
cause
and
security
etcetera.
an
appeal
may
not
be
taken
in
form
of
paupers
if
the
trial
court
certifies
in
writing
that
it
is
not
taken
in
good
faith,
so
that
it
applies
equally
to
appeals.
part
or
subsection
(d)
of
the
statute
says
“the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
any
such
person,
and
that
any
such
person
unable
to
employ
counsel,
it
may
dismiss
the
case
if
the
allegation
of
poverty
is
untrue
or
it
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.”
now
i
think
the
question
in
this
case
is
that
what
stage
in
the
proceedings
may
the
court,
whichever
court
it
may
be,
use
that
part
of
28
u.s.
code
section
1915.
now
since
griffin
against
illinois
in
1955,
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
clear
and
in
a
long
series
of
cases
dealing
with
appeal
matters
that
any
invidious
discrimination
against
an
indigent
defendant
will
not
be
sustained.
now,
the
question
is
how
do
you
decide
if
the
discrimination
in
any
particular
case
is
invidious.
in
douglas
against
california,
there
was
a
procedure
whereby
the
courts
of
appeal
of
a
state
in
that
case,
would
decide
if
the
issues
were
frivolous
or
faceless,
and
then
in
that
event
they
would
decide
that
counsel
need
not
be
required
and
they
would
not
appoint
counsel.
and
in
that
case
which
came
on
before
this
court,
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
equal
to
the
type
of
appeal
which
is
allowed
to
a
man
of
means
and
they
struck
down
that
part
of
the
california
procedures.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
the
district
judge
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
taking
the
appeal.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
already,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes,
mr.
justice,
he
had
three
parts.
he
wanted
a
transcript
of
the
proceeding
in
the
federal
district
court
which
apparently
was
available.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
he
wanted
counsel,
and
of
course
he
wanted
the
right
to
appeal.
now,
i
always
thought
or
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
striking
difference
between
the
procedures
available
was
the
letter
which
was
sent
back
to
him
by
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
after
that
court
had
denied
his
right
to
the
relief
requested,
she
wrote
back
and
said
“by
order
of
october
4,
1965,
the
court
denied
your
motion
for
reconsideration.”
he
had
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
and
said
“you
may
choose
either
of
the
following
alternatives.
one,
send
this
office
the
clerk's
fee
of
$25
together
with
four
copies
of
the
motion
to
docket
the
appeal
and
file
the
record
out
of
time,
or
two,
petition”
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
or
petition
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
now
he
chose
the
second
alternative
whether
because
he
didn't
have
the
$25
or
not
we
don't
know.
but
the
point
is
that
he
couldn't
get
into
the
court
of
appeals
without
paying
the
$25.
if
he'd
had
the
$25
they
would've
accepted
his
motion
to
docket
the
appeal
out
of
time,
and
then
of
course
he
would
be
authorized
to
proceed
himself
i
take
it.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
that
would
be
one
way
of
doing
it
mr.
justice,
but
i
personally
feel
that
the
issue
here
is
somewhat
broader
than
that.
i
think
there
is
an
important
question
here
with
respect
to
the
procedures
to
be
followed
in
general
by
the
courts
of
appeal
in
such
cases.
i
think
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
collateral
attack
field
just
recently
this
term
after
my
brief
had
been
filed
in
long
against
iowa.
that
on
an
appeal
in
a
collateral
attack
case
on
state
court,
the
petitioner
or
the
person
seeking
the
relief
is
entitled
to
a
transcript
of
the
record.
and
i
think
implied
in
that
decision
is
the
holding
that
also
counsel
would
be
required
in
collateral
attack
cases
on
appeal.
now,
we're
over
now
to
the
second
step
that
is
the
federal
collateral
attack
proceeding
after
a
petitioner
has
exhausted
all
of
his
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
then
he's
entitled
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
and
the
practice
generally
appears
to
be
to
assign
counsel,
although
the
lower
court
cases
say
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
counsel
in
habeas
corpus
cases
because
they
say
it
is
a
civil
proceeding.
but
the
practice
generally
is
to
appoint
counsel.
so
then
the
case
comes
on
for
appeal
and
the
third
circuit
i
take
it,
examine
the
papers
and
concluded
that
there
was
not
a
meritorious
question.
and
i
think
what
they
did
was
to
shortcut
the
procedure
of
the
statute.
statute
says
that
if
the
trial
court
certifies
the
appeals
taken
in
good
faith
then
it
should
be
allowed.
now
it
has
been
suggested
that
perhaps
if
the
courts
were
cynical,
they
would
docket
the
appeals
and
then
dismiss
them,
but
i
think
then
they
would
be
stuck
with
their
own
procedures.
the
third
circuit
for
example,
requires
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
appeal
must
be
served
five
days
than
others
and
the
briefs
are
allowed
and
usually
counsel
argue
in
the
third
circuit
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
appeal.
and
i
think
there's
another
value
to
that
because
once
you
get
to
that
point
in
a
proceeding,
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
party
seeking
to
dismiss
the
appeal
would
be
of
course
on
the
moving
part.
now
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
has
almost
said
that
the
appellant
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
some
merit
to
his
client.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that
is
what
the
district
court
found.
i
think
that
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
have
said
in
cases
where
a
district
judge
in
direct
appeal
in
a
federal
criminal
case,
has
issued
that
certificate
of
probable
cause
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
automatically
to
docket
the
appeal
and
assign
counsel
to
the
appellant.
now,
i
recognized
that
we
are
one
step
removed,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
procedure
followed
by
the
third
circuit
is
going
to
lead
to
the
problems
which
this
court
has
seen
in
the
direct
appeal
cases.
i
think
you're
going
to
eventually
have
to
conclude
that
where
a
man
contests
this
certificate
of
the
district
judge
he
should
be
entitled
to
counsel
to
assist
him
in
contesting
the
certificate.
that
was
decided
here
in
ellis
or
johnson,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
which
one,
but
either
one
of
those
cases
this
court
decided
that
the
district
judge's
finding
is
not
conclusive
of
the
issue
of
probable
cause
or
a
good
faith.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
those
were
both
direct
appeals
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
to
get
an
indigent's
appeal,
you
need
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
that's
why
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
it's
been
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
i
think
there
is
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.
you
see,
20
u.s.--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right,
but
it
has
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
in
fact
the
issue
what
is
--
it
amounts
to
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
in
ellis
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
--
that's
my
understanding,
the
practice
mr.
justice.
i
couldn't
say
that
is
entirely
true,
but
i
understand
that
is
the
practice.
the
reason
is
i
think
because
of
the
statutes
requiring
the
payment
of
fees
in
docketing
of
appeals.
you
simply
can
not
docket
an
appeal
whether
or
not
the
appeal
may
be
taken
under
2253,
i
think
it's
a
somewhat
different
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
i
think,
you
know,
i'd
like
to
agree
with
you.
i
think
that's
absolutely
right,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
clerks
of
the
courts
of
appeal
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right
mr.
justice.
i
think
--
surely
i
think
in
this
case
where
the
certificate
of
good
faith
or
probable
cause
has
been
issued.
then
i
think
the
courts
of
appeal
should
as
a
matter
of
right
docket
the
appeals.
i
think
they
should
assigned
counsel
before
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
suggest
that.
i
think
your
honor
that
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
surely
do
the
lesser
that
is
they
should
permit
the
man
to
docket
his
appeal.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
--
matter
of
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
of
course
the
only
problem
is
then
that
with
that
is
subsection
(d)
which
provides
that
the
courts
may
dismiss
the
case
if
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
now
it
doesn't
say
at
what
stage
it
may
do
that,
and
i
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
interprets
that
as
allowing
or
authorizing
it
to
dismiss
the
appeal
or
to
deny
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal
in
the
form
of
paupers.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
what
would
appear
from
the
bearer
record
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
we
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
we
do
know
that
there
was
certified
to
this
court
a
very
extensive
record.
how
many
of
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeal
read
it,
we
don't
know.
i
would
like
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
assume
that
they
examined
the
papers
because
on
the
face
of
the
papers,
there
was
raised
a
constitutional
question
with
respect
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
counsel
which
have
or
who
had
been
assigned
to
the
indigent
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
one
of
the
problems
i
think
is
that
if
this
court
simply
decides
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
have
the
appeal
docketed,
the
appeal
will
be
docketed
if
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court.
and
then
the
district
attorney
for
erie
county,
i
would
assume,
would
move
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
he
would
file
a
brief
and
he
would
go
down
perhaps
to
philadelphia
and
argue
it,
or
he
might
not
even
have
to
do
that.
if
the
petitioner
is
without
counsel,
or
without
the
tools
with
which
to
properly
meet
this
argument
then
i
don't
think
he
really
has
had
his
day
in
court.
i
think
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
man
is
going
to
get
one
full
and
fair
federal
appeal,
one
full
day
in
court.
now
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
my
knowledge,
i
think
that's
conceded
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
pauper.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
apparently
not,
but
while
i
can't
speak
for
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
practice
is
to
have
at
least
one
member
of
the
panel
examine
the
papers,
the
record
which
as
i
say
was
certified
to
this
court
included
the
opinion
of
judge
marsh
from
the
western
district
and
of
course
included
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
which
is
illuminating
but
is
not
entirely
dispositive
of
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
what
i
take
would
be
fact.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
do
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
judge.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
once
the
district
judge
has
made
that
certification
that
as
a
matter
of
right,
the
petitioner's
entitled
to
proceed.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i'll
tell
you
frankly
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
if
it's
no.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
it
appears
to
say
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
except
for
one
thing.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
but
if
the
district
judge
had
for
example
denied
the
certificate
then
the
same
question
is
presented
as
to
whether
in
appealing
from
the
denial
of
that
certificate,
counsel
should
be
allowed
to
the
applicant
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
that's
--
there
was
not.
this
is
an
easier
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
could.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
point,
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
which
i
think
mr.
justice
white
put
whether
it's
2253
of
title
28
that
were
concerned
with
or
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
and
perhaps
i
have
confused
the
court
somewhat
by
treating
this
as
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
which
in
my
opinion
it
is.
but
i
think
you
must
consider
the
what
we
call
the
fees
and
cost
section
of
28
section
--
beginning
at
section
1911,
and
it
says
“the
fees
and
cost
to
be
charged
and
collected
in
each
court
of
appeals
shall
be
proscribed
from
time
to
time
by
the
judicial
conference.”
and
then
rule
21
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
rules
provides
that
the
appellant
or
petitioner
shall
before
the
docketing
of
the
case
pay
the
docketing
fee,
but
this
payment
shall
not
be
required
by
the
united
states
when
a
party
or
of
the
appellant
or
petitioner
in
a
case
authorized
to
be
prosecuted
without
prepayment
of
costs.
and
the
only
provision
for
prosecution
of
the
case
without
prepayment
of
cost
is
in
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
so
that
although
2253
is
an
initial
step,
i
think
in
this
case
will
pass
that
and
although
it
appears
to
be
an
appeal
of
right,
it's
not
an
appeal
of
right
if
nowakowski
had
had
the
money
he
could've
had
an
appeal
of
right
of
course.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
it
depends
on
how
you
interpret
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
i
would
like
it
to
be
interpreted
in
this
fashion.
that
where
the
moving
papers
themselves
present
an
issue
which
is
not
on
its
face
frivolous
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
of
papers
would
present
a
truly
frivolous
issue.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
if
he
pays
the
fee,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
suggest
that
it
should.
i
suggest
that
it
should,
but
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
court
should
take
it
one
step
further
and
the
court
should
assign
counsel
to
the
indigent
to
prosecute
his
appeal.
i
think
it's
a
rather
hollow
right
if
we
simply
say
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal.
he
takes
the
case
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
if
he
does
not
have
a
lawyer
and
if
there
were
not
a
transcript
available
from
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
then
i
think
it
is
a
rather
whole
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
is
the
practice
in
the
third
circuit,
i
notice
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
of
course
one
of
the
applications
in
this
case
mr.
justice
was
for
the
assignment
of
counsel.
that
was
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes,
on
his
second
petition
for
a
--
he
filed
actually
two
pleadings
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
one
of
them
was
a
request
for
the
assignment
of
counsel.
that
was
also
denied
together
with
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
did
file
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
did,
that's
correct.
now
i
have
perhaps
with
good
reason
avoided
discussion
of
the
merits
in
this
case.
it's
not
a
very
great
case
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
issues
involved.
the
small
amount
of
money
was
taken
from
the
tavern
out
in
erie,
pennsylvania.
it
struck
me
the
facts
in
this
case
very
much
similar
to
those
in
gideon
and
wainwright.
the
contents
of
a
--
i
think
it
was
the
pool
hall
there,
and
here
it's
a
tavern
and
a
couple
of
machines
were
broken
into.
and
it
doesn't
seem
like
much
but
if
in
my
opinion,
the
district
or
the
trial
judge
had
excluded
the
evidence
of
the
accomplice
and
excluded
the
evidence
of
the
offer
of
a
compromise.
i
really
don't
think
there
was
any
evidence
of
guilt
at
all.
and
then
that
case
i
think
the
petitioner
should've
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
because
there
was
no
positive
proof
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
hallow
case
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
i
think
the
petitioner
does
have
the
meritorious
claim
even
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
discretion
to
pass
on
those
issues
of
frivolity.
i
think
they
were
not
frivolous
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
comment
i
wanted
to
make
was
with
respect
to
your
question
of
whether
this
case
represents
a
supporting
a
law,
the
respondent
filed
that
a
brief
at
pages
8
and
9
of
which
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
contain
language
to
the
effect
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
discretion
with
respect
to
these
pauper
appeals.
and
i
think
that
is,
from
my
reading
of
the
cases,
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
they
have
a
discretion
under
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915
to
deny
the
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers
if
they
are
satisfied
that
the
issues
are
frivolous.
i
think
if
you
analogize
it
to
the
direct
appeal
cases,
i
think
they
are
reading
the
same
type
of
thinking
into
these
collateral
attack
appeals,
and
putting
this
issue
of
frivolity
to
themselves
as
a
matter
of
initial
determination.
and
then
once
they
reach
that
conclusion
and
they
say
that
we
have
this
discretion
to
deny
the
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers,
and
that
carries
with
it
everything,
then
the
application
for
counsel,
the
application
for
the
transcript
and
whatever
other
assistance
the
petitioner
or
the
pauper
needs
to
make
a
worthwhile
appeal
are
denied
to
him.
now
i
think
that
is
the
kind
of
invalid
discrimination
that
this
court
has
struck
down
in
the
past.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
district
attorney.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit,
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
narrowly
stated
the
question
presented
in
the
case
as
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
denying
this
petitioner
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
which
had
discharged
an
order
in
connection
with
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
think
more
broadly
stated
the
question
in
the
case
whether
this
court
and
whether
in
fact
the
federal
system
administration
and
justice,
can
make
a
reality
of
the
emblem
of
the
court
which
is
carved
in
stone
on
the
front
of
the
court,
equal
justice
under
law.
basically,
the
question
which
presents
itself
to
the
court
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
my
opinion,
namely
28
u.s.
code
section
1915,
now
that
section
or
that
statute
provides
basically
the
procedure
or
the
scheme
whereby
indigent
proceedings
may
be
brought
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
it's
a
very
general
statute
and
it
applies
to
any
court
of
the
united
states.
it
says
that
they
may
--
any
court
may
authorize
the
commencement
and
certainly
of
any
suit
without
prepayment
of
fees,
cause
and
security
etcetera.
an
appeal
may
not
be
taken
in
form
of
paupers
if
the
trial
court
certifies
in
writing
that
it
is
not
taken
in
good
faith,
so
that
it
applies
equally
to
appeals.
part
or
subsection
(d)
of
the
statute
says
“the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
any
such
person,
and
that
any
such
person
unable
to
employ
counsel,
it
may
dismiss
the
case
if
the
allegation
of
poverty
is
untrue
or
it
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.”
now
i
think
the
question
in
this
case
is
that
what
stage
in
the
proceedings
may
the
court,
whichever
court
it
may
be,
use
that
part
of
28
u.s.
code
section
1915.
now
since
griffin
against
illinois
in
1955,
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
clear
and
in
a
long
series
of
cases
dealing
with
appeal
matters
that
any
invidious
discrimination
against
an
indigent
defendant
will
not
be
sustained.
now,
the
question
is
how
do
you
decide
if
the
discrimination
in
any
particular
case
is
invidious.
in
douglas
against
california,
there
was
a
procedure
whereby
the
courts
of
appeal
of
a
state
in
that
case,
would
decide
if
the
issues
were
frivolous
or
faceless,
and
then
in
that
event
they
would
decide
that
counsel
need
not
be
required
and
they
would
not
appoint
counsel.
and
in
that
case
which
came
on
before
this
court,
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
equal
to
the
type
of
appeal
which
is
allowed
to
a
man
of
means
and
they
struck
down
that
part
of
the
california
procedures.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
the
district
judge
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
taking
the
appeal.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
already,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes,
mr.
justice,
he
had
three
parts.
he
wanted
a
transcript
of
the
proceeding
in
the
federal
district
court
which
apparently
was
available.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
he
wanted
counsel,
and
of
course
he
wanted
the
right
to
appeal.
now,
i
always
thought
or
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
striking
difference
between
the
procedures
available
was
the
letter
which
was
sent
back
to
him
by
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
after
that
court
had
denied
his
right
to
the
relief
requested,
she
wrote
back
and
said
“by
order
of
october
4,
1965,
the
court
denied
your
motion
for
reconsideration.”
he
had
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
and
said
“you
may
choose
either
of
the
following
alternatives.
one,
send
this
office
the
clerk's
fee
of
$25
together
with
four
copies
of
the
motion
to
docket
the
appeal
and
file
the
record
out
of
time,
or
two,
petition”
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
or
petition
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
now
he
chose
the
second
alternative
whether
because
he
didn't
have
the
$25
or
not
we
don't
know.
but
the
point
is
that
he
couldn't
get
into
the
court
of
appeals
without
paying
the
$25.
if
he'd
had
the
$25
they
would've
accepted
his
motion
to
docket
the
appeal
out
of
time,
and
then
of
course
he
would
be
authorized
to
proceed
himself
i
take
it.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
that
would
be
one
way
of
doing
it
mr.
justice,
but
i
personally
feel
that
the
issue
here
is
somewhat
broader
than
that.
i
think
there
is
an
important
question
here
with
respect
to
the
procedures
to
be
followed
in
general
by
the
courts
of
appeal
in
such
cases.
i
think
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
collateral
attack
field
just
recently
this
term
after
my
brief
had
been
filed
in
long
against
iowa.
that
on
an
appeal
in
a
collateral
attack
case
on
state
court,
the
petitioner
or
the
person
seeking
the
relief
is
entitled
to
a
transcript
of
the
record.
and
i
think
implied
in
that
decision
is
the
holding
that
also
counsel
would
be
required
in
collateral
attack
cases
on
appeal.
now,
we're
over
now
to
the
second
step
that
is
the
federal
collateral
attack
proceeding
after
a
petitioner
has
exhausted
all
of
his
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
then
he's
entitled
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
and
the
practice
generally
appears
to
be
to
assign
counsel,
although
the
lower
court
cases
say
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
counsel
in
habeas
corpus
cases
because
they
say
it
is
a
civil
proceeding.
but
the
practice
generally
is
to
appoint
counsel.
so
then
the
case
comes
on
for
appeal
and
the
third
circuit
i
take
it,
examine
the
papers
and
concluded
that
there
was
not
a
meritorious
question.
and
i
think
what
they
did
was
to
shortcut
the
procedure
of
the
statute.
statute
says
that
if
the
trial
court
certifies
the
appeals
taken
in
good
faith
then
it
should
be
allowed.
now
it
has
been
suggested
that
perhaps
if
the
courts
were
cynical,
they
would
docket
the
appeals
and
then
dismiss
them,
but
i
think
then
they
would
be
stuck
with
their
own
procedures.
the
third
circuit
for
example,
requires
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
appeal
must
be
served
five
days
than
others
and
the
briefs
are
allowed
and
usually
counsel
argue
in
the
third
circuit
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
appeal.
and
i
think
there's
another
value
to
that
because
once
you
get
to
that
point
in
a
proceeding,
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
party
seeking
to
dismiss
the
appeal
would
be
of
course
on
the
moving
part.
now
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
has
almost
said
that
the
appellant
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
some
merit
to
his
client.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that
is
what
the
district
court
found.
i
think
that
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
have
said
in
cases
where
a
district
judge
in
direct
appeal
in
a
federal
criminal
case,
has
issued
that
certificate
of
probable
cause
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
automatically
to
docket
the
appeal
and
assign
counsel
to
the
appellant.
now,
i
recognized
that
we
are
one
step
removed,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
procedure
followed
by
the
third
circuit
is
going
to
lead
to
the
problems
which
this
court
has
seen
in
the
direct
appeal
cases.
i
think
you're
going
to
eventually
have
to
conclude
that
where
a
man
contests
this
certificate
of
the
district
judge
he
should
be
entitled
to
counsel
to
assist
him
in
contesting
the
certificate.
that
was
decided
here
in
ellis
or
johnson,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
which
one,
but
either
one
of
those
cases
this
court
decided
that
the
district
judge's
finding
is
not
conclusive
of
the
issue
of
probable
cause
or
a
good
faith.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
those
were
both
direct
appeals
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
to
get
an
indigent's
appeal,
you
need
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
that's
why
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
it's
been
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
i
think
there
is
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.
you
see,
20
u.s.--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right,
but
it
has
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
in
fact
the
issue
what
is
--
it
amounts
to
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
in
ellis
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
--
that's
my
understanding,
the
practice
mr.
justice.
i
couldn't
say
that
is
entirely
true,
but
i
understand
that
is
the
practice.
the
reason
is
i
think
because
of
the
statutes
requiring
the
payment
of
fees
in
docketing
of
appeals.
you
simply
can
not
docket
an
appeal
whether
or
not
the
appeal
may
be
taken
under
2253,
i
think
it's
a
somewhat
different
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
i
think,
you
know,
i'd
like
to
agree
with
you.
i
think
that's
absolutely
right,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
clerks
of
the
courts
of
appeal
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right
mr.
justice.
i
think
--
surely
i
think
in
this
case
where
the
certificate
of
good
faith
or
probable
cause
has
been
issued.
then
i
think
the
courts
of
appeal
should
as
a
matter
of
right
docket
the
appeals.
i
think
they
should
assigned
counsel
before
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
suggest
that.
i
think
your
honor
that
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
surely
do
the
lesser
that
is
they
should
permit
the
man
to
docket
his
appeal.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
--
matter
of
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
of
course
the
only
problem
is
then
that
with
that
is
subsection
(d)
which
provides
that
the
courts
may
dismiss
the
case
if
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
now
it
doesn't
say
at
what
stage
it
may
do
that,
and
i
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
interprets
that
as
allowing
or
authorizing
it
to
dismiss
the
appeal
or
to
deny
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal
in
the
form
of
paupers.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
what
would
appear
from
the
bearer
record
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
we
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
we
do
know
that
there
was
certified
to
this
court
a
very
extensive
record.
how
many
of
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeal
read
it,
we
don't
know.
i
would
like
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
assume
that
they
examined
the
papers
because
on
the
face
of
the
papers,
there
was
raised
a
constitutional
question
with
respect
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
counsel
which
have
or
who
had
been
assigned
to
the
indigent
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
one
of
the
problems
i
think
is
that
if
this
court
simply
decides
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
have
the
appeal
docketed,
the
appeal
will
be
docketed
if
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court.
and
then
the
district
attorney
for
erie
county,
i
would
assume,
would
move
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
he
would
file
a
brief
and
he
would
go
down
perhaps
to
philadelphia
and
argue
it,
or
he
might
not
even
have
to
do
that.
if
the
petitioner
is
without
counsel,
or
without
the
tools
with
which
to
properly
meet
this
argument
then
i
don't
think
he
really
has
had
his
day
in
court.
i
think
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
man
is
going
to
get
one
full
and
fair
federal
appeal,
one
full
day
in
court.
now
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
my
knowledge,
i
think
that's
conceded
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
pauper.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
apparently
not,
but
while
i
can't
speak
for
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
practice
is
to
have
at
least
one
member
of
the
panel
examine
the
papers,
the
record
which
as
i
say
was
certified
to
this
court
included
the
opinion
of
judge
marsh
from
the
western
district
and
of
course
included
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
which
is
illuminating
but
is
not
entirely
dispositive
of
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
what
i
take
would
be
fact.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
do
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
judge.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
once
the
district
judge
has
made
that
certification
that
as
a
matter
of
right,
the
petitioner's
entitled
to
proceed.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i'll
tell
you
frankly
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
if
it's
no.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
it
appears
to
say
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
except
for
one
thing.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
but
if
the
district
judge
had
for
example
denied
the
certificate
then
the
same
question
is
presented
as
to
whether
in
appealing
from
the
denial
of
that
certificate,
counsel
should
be
allowed
to
the
applicant
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
no,
that's
--
there
was
not.
this
is
an
easier
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
could.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
point,
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
which
i
think
mr.
justice
white
put
whether
it's
2253
of
title
28
that
were
concerned
with
or
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
and
perhaps
i
have
confused
the
court
somewhat
by
treating
this
as
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
which
in
my
opinion
it
is.
but
i
think
you
must
consider
the
what
we
call
the
fees
and
cost
section
of
28
section
--
beginning
at
section
1911,
and
it
says
“the
fees
and
cost
to
be
charged
and
collected
in
each
court
of
appeals
shall
be
proscribed
from
time
to
time
by
the
judicial
conference.”
and
then
rule
21
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
rules
provides
that
the
appellant
or
petitioner
shall
before
the
docketing
of
the
case
pay
the
docketing
fee,
but
this
payment
shall
not
be
required
by
the
united
states
when
a
party
or
of
the
appellant
or
petitioner
in
a
case
authorized
to
be
prosecuted
without
prepayment
of
costs.
and
the
only
provision
for
prosecution
of
the
case
without
prepayment
of
cost
is
in
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
so
that
although
2253
is
an
initial
step,
i
think
in
this
case
will
pass
that
and
although
it
appears
to
be
an
appeal
of
right,
it's
not
an
appeal
of
right
if
nowakowski
had
had
the
money
he
could've
had
an
appeal
of
right
of
course.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
it
depends
on
how
you
interpret
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
i
would
like
it
to
be
interpreted
in
this
fashion.
that
where
the
moving
papers
themselves
present
an
issue
which
is
not
on
its
face
frivolous
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
of
papers
would
present
a
truly
frivolous
issue.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
if
he
pays
the
fee,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
suggest
that
it
should.
i
suggest
that
it
should,
but
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
court
should
take
it
one
step
further
and
the
court
should
assign
counsel
to
the
indigent
to
prosecute
his
appeal.
i
think
it's
a
rather
hollow
right
if
we
simply
say
that
he
has
a
right
to
appeal.
he
takes
the
case
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
if
he
does
not
have
a
lawyer
and
if
there
were
not
a
transcript
available
from
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
then
i
think
it
is
a
rather
whole
right.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
is
the
practice
in
the
third
circuit,
i
notice
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
well
of
course
one
of
the
applications
in
this
case
mr.
justice
was
for
the
assignment
of
counsel.
that
was
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
yes,
on
his
second
petition
for
a
--
he
filed
actually
two
pleadings
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
one
of
them
was
a
request
for
the
assignment
of
counsel.
that
was
also
denied
together
with
--
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
did
file
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
he
did,
that's
correct.
now
i
have
perhaps
with
good
reason
avoided
discussion
of
the
merits
in
this
case.
it's
not
a
very
great
case
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
issues
involved.
the
small
amount
of
money
was
taken
from
the
tavern
out
in
erie,
pennsylvania.
it
struck
me
the
facts
in
this
case
very
much
similar
to
those
in
gideon
and
wainwright.
the
contents
of
a
--
i
think
it
was
the
pool
hall
there,
and
here
it's
a
tavern
and
a
couple
of
machines
were
broken
into.
and
it
doesn't
seem
like
much
but
if
in
my
opinion,
the
district
or
the
trial
judge
had
excluded
the
evidence
of
the
accomplice
and
excluded
the
evidence
of
the
offer
of
a
compromise.
i
really
don't
think
there
was
any
evidence
of
guilt
at
all.
and
then
that
case
i
think
the
petitioner
should've
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
because
there
was
no
positive
proof
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
hallow
case
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
i
think
the
petitioner
does
have
the
meritorious
claim
even
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
discretion
to
pass
on
those
issues
of
frivolity.
i
think
they
were
not
frivolous
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
j.
o'hern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
comment
i
wanted
to
make
was
with
respect
to
your
question
of
whether
this
case
represents
a
supporting
a
law,
the
respondent
filed
that
a
brief
at
pages
8
and
9
of
which
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
contain
language
to
the
effect
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
discretion
with
respect
to
these
pauper
appeals.
and
i
think
that
is,
from
my
reading
of
the
cases,
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
they
have
a
discretion
under
28
u.s.
code,
section
1915
to
deny
the
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers
if
they
are
satisfied
that
the
issues
are
frivolous.
i
think
if
you
analogize
it
to
the
direct
appeal
cases,
i
think
they
are
reading
the
same
type
of
thinking
into
these
collateral
attack
appeals,
and
putting
this
issue
of
frivolity
to
themselves
as
a
matter
of
initial
determination.
and
then
once
they
reach
that
conclusion
and
they
say
that
we
have
this
discretion
to
deny
the
leave
to
appeal
in
form
of
paupers,
and
that
carries
with
it
everything,
then
the
application
for
counsel,
the
application
for
the
transcript
and
whatever
other
assistance
the
petitioner
or
the
pauper
needs
to
make
a
worthwhile
appeal
are
denied
to
him.
now
i
think
that
is
the
kind
of
invalid
discrimination
that
this
court
has
struck
down
in
the
past.
