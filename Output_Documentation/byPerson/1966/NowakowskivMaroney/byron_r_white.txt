justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
1915
provides
for
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
it's
going
to
say
that
whatever
--
i
thought
the
amicus
is
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
this
case
was
because
of
2253?
justice
byron
r.
white
2253
says
in
circuit
cases
just
like
this
you
can't
take
an
appeal
whether
informal
or
not
without
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
because
of
a
state
case
that
--
and
it's
a
state
--
this
for
habeas
corpus
where
it
follows
in
custody
by
the
state.
now
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
is
not
been
an
informal
case,
there
still
would've
have
to
find
probable
cause.
now
let's
assume
that
it's
been
a
federal
prisoner
asking
for
--
wanting
to
file
a
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
informal
would
there
be
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
of
certificate
of
probable
cause
or
a
certificate
of
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
--
where
are
the
cases
to
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
said
--
1915
says
an
appeal
may
not
be
taken
in
form
of
paupers
if
the
trial
court
certified
in
writing
and
it
would
not
taken
him
to
stay.
that's
why
it's
in
this
section
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
--
if
there's
--
he
doesn't
have
to
certify
that
it
isn't
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
thought
you
say
that
is
the
practice
in
federal
cases,
for
a
federal
prisoner?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
just
--
all
i
say
is
i
just
don't
claim
any
requirement
in
1915
where
there
is
a
probable
cause
and
that
as
long
as
there's
a
--
as
long
as
you
can
establish
that
he's
indigent,
and
the
trial
judge
doesn't
say
that
there's
bad
faith
here,
there's
no
title
to
an
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
is
about
the
case
that
tested
out
because
there
was
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
2253.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
he
doesn't
even
need
to
appeal
from
it,
all
it
need
to
do
is
ask
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
which
isn't
necessarily
on
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
can
ask
a
circuit
justice
for
it,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
can
appeal
his
right
if
he's
a
pauper.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
interpret
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
couldn't
call
it
frivolous,
could
you,
if
a
party
who
is
paying
had
a
particular
probable
cause,
he
may
have
his
case
docketed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
shouldn't
he
pay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
respect
under
this
section?
you
mean
just
denying
permission
to
proceed
in
form
of
paupers?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
counsel
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
didn't
he
also
move
for
a
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
page
136,
petition
for
records
and
documents
in
form
of
pauper?
petitioner
contends
he
needs
a
transcript
thinking
his
hearing
in
the
district
court.
and
there's
a
denial
of
that
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
may
be
so,
but
they
did
--
he
did
ask
for
a
transcript
and
it
was
denied,
along
with
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
court's
grounds
were
for
denying
this
petition
with
all
of
his
grounds,
whatever
they
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
passed
on
the
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
contend
that
the
court
denied
because
any
doubt
of
being
a
pauper
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
think
they've
got
appointed
counsel
said
he
thought
the
merits
were
not
frivolous.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
comes
down
to
frivolity
and
whether
the
court
sitting
without
a
record,
without
counsel,
without
argument
or
without
briefs
can
dismiss
it
as
frivolous?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
just
make
sure
i
understand.
do
you
say
that
a
paid
fellow
who
hired
his
own
lawyer
and
is
paying
it
can
have
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
dismissed
for
the
trial
judge
and
then
the
trial
judge
issue
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
and
then
have
--
and
he
hire
his
own
counsel
for
the
appeal.
and
you
say
he
can
have
his
--
the
same
thing
happen
to
him
has
happened
to
this
man
in
the
court
of
appeals
without
ever
a
brief
or
an
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
in

of
the

justice
byron
r.

in

of
the

that
2253
provides
for
certificate
of

either
from

court

from
the
court
of
