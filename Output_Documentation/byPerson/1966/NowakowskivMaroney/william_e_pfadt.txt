mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
it's
conceded
your
honor.
for
the
record,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
certain
misconceptions
based
or
caused
mainly
by
inadequate
record
i
believe.
the
action
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
instituted
by
mr.
nowakowski
filing
a
three-part
petition,
one
in
which
he
asked
to
proceed
in
form
of
paupers.
the
second
in
which
he
asked
for
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
be
court
appointed,
and
the
third
in
which
he
set
out
the
merits
of
his
appeal.
and
the
question
has
arisen
whether
or
not
this
matter
was
docketed.
it
was
docketed.
it
did
go
beyond
the
courts
and
the
clerk's
office
and
it
reached
justice
biggs'
hands
and
he
made
the
decision.
overall
on
the
three
parts
in
which
the
petition
was
denied
without
specifically
saying
this
part
one
is
denied
or
part
two
or
part
three,
the
entire
petition
was
denied.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
under
section
1915
i
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
under
section
28-1915,
the
court
may
dismiss
the
case
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
--
if
the
allegation
of
poverty
is
untrue
or
have
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
pardon?
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well,
it
was
my
understanding
that
he
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
he
was
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
didn't
understand
what
you
meant
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
so
that
there
was
this
action
and
it
wasn't
a
bare
application
which
reached
the
clerk's
office
and
was
sent
back
because
the
fees,
the
filing
fees
were
not
advanced
to
the
extent
that
the
petition
itself
set
out
the
petitioner's
case
in
the
three
regards.
it
was
considered
by
the
court
and
the
petition
was
denied.
i
would
like
to
point
out
for
the
court,
and
this
is
apart
from
argument
that
this
matter
involved
in
this
case
against
mr.
nowakowski
was
a
matter
in
which
the
minimum
of
three
to
seven
years
had
expired
in
1962.
he
was
paroled
on
this
charge
in
june
of
1964
and
began
to
serve
a
subsequent
sentence
which
was
imposed
on
a
prison
breach
charge
and
the
maximum
sentence
on
this
burglary
conviction
that
is
the
subject
of
this
appeal
expired
in
december
of
1966.
mr.
nowakowski
at
the
present
time
serving
a
four
to
ten
year
sentence
on
prison
breach
which
began
in
1964
when
he
was
paroled
and
subsequently
he
is
faced
with
service
of
two
and
half
to
five
years
on
account
of
an
assault
by
a
prisoner
charge,
where
he
assaulted
an
employee
of
the
western
penitentiary
in
pennsylvania.
i
point
that
out
to
the
court
for
the
reason
that
the
matter
involved
--
the
sentence
involved
in
this
particular
case
in
which
the
trial
and
counsel
at
the
trial
of
the
burglary
conviction
is
the
subject
matter
of,
basically
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
minimum
--
the
actual
time
served
has
expired
and
the
maximum
time
has
expired.
i
don't
mean
that
that
creates
an
insuperable
problem
but
it
is
something
i
think
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in
and
should
know.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
because
the
actual
sentence
in
regard
to
--
if
the
court
should
decide
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
third
circuit
and
referring
it
back
to
the
third
circuit
that
there's
no
doubt
that
the
third
circuit
could
hear
it,
but
whether
or
not
eventually
a
new
trial
would
be
allowed
after
service
of
the
complete
time
or
expiration
of
complete
time.
i
don't
know
what
the
consequence
or
what
the
workings
there
may
be.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
there's
nothing
in
this
particular
charge
to
release
him
from,
because
he's
serving
on
a
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
none
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
that
situation
existing.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
that's
right.
like
mr.
o'hern,
i
believe
that
the
issue
here
is
a
narrow
one.
i
think
that
the
issue
is
under
28
section
1915
where
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
may
dismiss
an
indigent's
appeal
if
they're
satisfied
if
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
without
specifically
saying
why
it
was
done,
we
--
there
was
no
reason
given
your
honor.
we
assume
that
because
it
was
done
that
it
had
to
be
done
on
one
or
the
other
--
from
or
the
other
reasons.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it's
true
it
may
not
have
been
done
at
all,
but
the
action
of
justice
biggs
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
appeal
is
dismissed
in
order
to
justify
it
without
looking
to
any
wording
in
the
opinion
it
would
have
to
be
done
on
the
basis
of
some
provision
of
section
1915.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well
i
believe
that
the
basis
for
dismissing
without
knowing
the
basis
for
dismissing,
without
knowing
what
they
may
be
in
the
particular
case
would
have
to
be
assumed
to
have
been
done
properly
under
this
section.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
denial
of
the
entire
petition
your
honor
which
included
in
form
of
paupers
counsel
and
the
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
--
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
no.
his
petition
was
in
three
parts
your
honor,
in
form
--
petition
to
proceed
in
form
of
paupers,
appointment
of
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
that's
true
your
honor,
but
as
later
--
as
the
petition
states
later,
there
are
other
reasons
given
in
the
bear.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
considering
part
of
his
petition,
the
petition
was
denied
there's
no
question,
but
that
wasn't
the
only
point
of
his
petition.
he
actually
was
--
had
set
forth
his
entire
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
believe
that
assuming
that
the
court's
actions
were
according
to
statutory
authority
that
the
court
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
frivolity.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
to
the
extent
that
they
could
determine
from
the
record
presented
to
them
that
this
appeal
was
frivolous.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
no,
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
believe
sir.
i
believe
that
they
would
have.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
can
do
that
yes.
i
think
that
that's
the
question,
the
narrow
question
involved
and
i
think
that
the
argument
of
petitioner
is
that
there
is
discrimination
on
account
of
an
indigent
defendant
because
the
court,
under
section
1915
may
dismiss
for
--
on
the
basis
of
frivolity
sake.
whereas,
in
the
case
of
paid
counsel,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
opportunity
to
have
briefs
presented
and
argument
and
at
least
a
motion
by
someone
to
dismiss
before
he
were
denied
his
appeal.
and
i
think
that's
the
narrow
question
whether
there
is
--
whether
that
difference
in
treatment
of
indigent
defendants
and
treatment
of
defendants
with
paid
counsel
constitutes
a
constitutional
discrimination
against
indigent
defendants.
if
i
may,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
a
difference,
certainly,
indigent
defendants
are
handled
differently
--
the
petitions
of
indigent
defendants
are
handled
differently
than
are
the
petitions
of
defendants
with
paid
counsel,
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
discrimination.
i
don't
believe
the
difference
means
discrimination.
my
reason
for
that
is
that
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
brief
which
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
dismiss
on
motion
an
appeal.
it
may
request
in
fact
if
they
believe
there's
frivolity
in
the
appeal,
may
request
that
the
--
that
a
motion
be
filed
which
has
been
done
in
certain
courts
of
appeals.
so
that
the
end
result
is
that
the
defendant
with
paid
counsel
may
find
themselves
in
the
very
position
that
an
indigent
defendant
finds
himself
when
he
isn't
represented
in
argument
and
by
filing
a
briefs
before
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
is
possible
your
honor,
i
believe
yes.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
wouldn't
happen
in
the
same
way
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well
i
don't
know
this
2253
enters
into
this
part
of
it.
i
say
that
in
regard
to
with
defendant
with
a
paid
attorney,
he
may
be
able
to
file
briefs.
he
may
be
allowed
some
extra
proceedings,
but
the
end
result
without
ever
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well
they
aren't
necessary
because
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
opportunity
is
greater
in
the
case
of
a
paid
attorney
for
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
is
very
important.
i
meant
to
say
that
the
end
result
without
ever
--a
review
could
be
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
without
ever
having
a
hearing,
without
briefs
being
submitted,
the
court
on
motion
could
dismiss.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
no,
there
can't
be
because
there's
no
one
on
the
other
side
at
this
point
your
honor,
i
agree.
i
say
that
in
the
case
of
a
paid
counsel
for
a
defendant,
you
may
have
the
same
result,
because
on
motion
of
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
that
the
case
be
dismissed
because
of
not
say
frivolity.
the
court
could
make
an
order
and
the
defendant
in
that
case,
even
with
his
paid
counsel,
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
this
indigent
have
been
of
this
here.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
there
are
differences
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
and
there
are
important
differences
as
justice
brennan
points
out.
but
i
say
that
because
there
are
those
differences,
doesn't
mean
that
there's
discrimination
against
an
indigent
defendant
on
account
of
his
indigency.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
was
filed
pro
se.
your
honor,
if
the
record
will
disclose
that
a
mr.
stooks
of
pittsburgh
had
represented
the
defendant
in
his
argument
before
the
district
court
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes,
and
the
district
court
have
ruled
and
the
attorney
had
filed
the
appeal
for
this
defendant,
but
then
asked
to
be
excused
before
the
--
before
any
further
proceedings
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes
had
filed
notice,
excuse
me.
and
was
excuse
by
the
court
before
any
proceedings
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
to
the
circuit
court?
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
there
was
no
notice
that
i
know.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes,
the
warden.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
that
the
appellant
has
to
notify
the
respondent
who
would
be
the
warden
on
this
one.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
your
honor,
not
that
i
know
of.
the
record
certainly
does
not
disclose
that.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
only
--
perhaps
i'm
mistaken,
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
if
the
court,
the
circuit
court,
had
considered
this
matter
and
justice
biggs
had
issued
an
order
that
it
would
be
a
docketed
matter.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
again,
because
of
the
--
i'm
not
sure
that
such
a
notice
was
ever
given.
we
have
no
record
of
it,
but
we
are
in
the
manner
of
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
that
yes,
i
think
that
1915
gives
at
par.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
that
the
third
circuit
has
a
record,
your
honor,
providing
counsel
of
giving
hearings.
i
think
that
this
is
somewhat
the
unusual.
if
i
may,
much
was
said
about
the
certificate
probable
cause
and
its
function.
under
2253,
where
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
made
a
requirement
of
appeal,
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
that
certificate
of
probable
cause
standing
on
its
own
does
not
mean
anything
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
as
to
--
as
it's
not
binding
in
anyway
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
provides
--
that's
right
it's
a
requirement,
and
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
actually
is
nothing
more
than
that
the
trial
judge
believes
that
the
person
asking
for
this
is
sincere.
he
may
not
agree
with
him
and
obviously
he
doesn't
agree
with
him
because
he
just
ruled
against
him.
but
if
he
believes
that
he
has
a
sincere
argument
and
without
regard
to
the
merits,
then
he
will
grant
certificate
of
probable
cause
which
was
done
here,
because
judge
marsh
who
was
the
district
judge
presiding
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
the
one
who
granted
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
within
days
after
he
had
made
the
order
denying
this
man
his
writ.
to
go
back
to
what
i
said,
i
believe
that
it's
the
narrow
point
here.
does
section
1915
create
a
situation
where
an
indigent
defendant
is
discriminated
against
because
of
the
procedure
set
out
in
that
section,
as
opposed
to
what
a
defendant
with
paid
counsel
may
be
entitled
to
under
his
general
rights
to
appeal
in
the
procedures
in
the
court
of
appeals?
i
say
that
in
answer
to
that,
my
answer
to
the
problem
is
that
acknowledge
there
are
differences
but
denied
that
there
are
discriminatory
differences.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
it's
conceded
your
honor.
for
the
record,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
certain
misconceptions
based
or
caused
mainly
by
inadequate
record
i
believe.
the
action
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
instituted
by
mr.
nowakowski
filing
a
three-part
petition,
one
in
which
he
asked
to
proceed
in
form
of
paupers.
the
second
in
which
he
asked
for
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
be
court
appointed,
and
the
third
in
which
he
set
out
the
merits
of
his
appeal.
and
the
question
has
arisen
whether
or
not
this
matter
was
docketed.
it
was
docketed.
it
did
go
beyond
the
courts
and
the
clerk's
office
and
it
reached
justice
biggs'
hands
and
he
made
the
decision.
overall
on
the
three
parts
in
which
the
petition
was
denied
without
specifically
saying
this
part
one
is
denied
or
part
two
or
part
three,
the
entire
petition
was
denied.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
under
section
1915
i
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
under
section
28-1915,
the
court
may
dismiss
the
case
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
--
if
the
allegation
of
poverty
is
untrue
or
have
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
pardon?
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well,
it
was
my
understanding
that
he
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
he
was
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
didn't
understand
what
you
meant
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
so
that
there
was
this
action
and
it
wasn't
a
bare
application
which
reached
the
clerk's
office
and
was
sent
back
because
the
fees,
the
filing
fees
were
not
advanced
to
the
extent
that
the
petition
itself
set
out
the
petitioner's
case
in
the
three
regards.
it
was
considered
by
the
court
and
the
petition
was
denied.
i
would
like
to
point
out
for
the
court,
and
this
is
apart
from
argument
that
this
matter
involved
in
this
case
against
mr.
nowakowski
was
a
matter
in
which
the
minimum
of
three
to
seven
years
had
expired
in
1962.
he
was
paroled
on
this
charge
in
june
of
1964
and
began
to
serve
a
subsequent
sentence
which
was
imposed
on
a
prison
breach
charge
and
the
maximum
sentence
on
this
burglary
conviction
that
is
the
subject
of
this
appeal
expired
in
december
of
1966.
mr.
nowakowski
at
the
present
time
serving
a
four
to
ten
year
sentence
on
prison
breach
which
began
in
1964
when
he
was
paroled
and
subsequently
he
is
faced
with
service
of
two
and
half
to
five
years
on
account
of
an
assault
by
a
prisoner
charge,
where
he
assaulted
an
employee
of
the
western
penitentiary
in
pennsylvania.
i
point
that
out
to
the
court
for
the
reason
that
the
matter
involved
--
the
sentence
involved
in
this
particular
case
in
which
the
trial
and
counsel
at
the
trial
of
the
burglary
conviction
is
the
subject
matter
of,
basically
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
minimum
--
the
actual
time
served
has
expired
and
the
maximum
time
has
expired.
i
don't
mean
that
that
creates
an
insuperable
problem
but
it
is
something
i
think
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in
and
should
know.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
because
the
actual
sentence
in
regard
to
--
if
the
court
should
decide
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
third
circuit
and
referring
it
back
to
the
third
circuit
that
there's
no
doubt
that
the
third
circuit
could
hear
it,
but
whether
or
not
eventually
a
new
trial
would
be
allowed
after
service
of
the
complete
time
or
expiration
of
complete
time.
i
don't
know
what
the
consequence
or
what
the
workings
there
may
be.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
there's
nothing
in
this
particular
charge
to
release
him
from,
because
he's
serving
on
a
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
none
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
that
situation
existing.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
that's
right.
like
mr.
o'hern,
i
believe
that
the
issue
here
is
a
narrow
one.
i
think
that
the
issue
is
under
28
section
1915
where
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
may
dismiss
an
indigent's
appeal
if
they're
satisfied
if
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
without
specifically
saying
why
it
was
done,
we
--
there
was
no
reason
given
your
honor.
we
assume
that
because
it
was
done
that
it
had
to
be
done
on
one
or
the
other
--
from
or
the
other
reasons.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it's
true
it
may
not
have
been
done
at
all,
but
the
action
of
justice
biggs
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
appeal
is
dismissed
in
order
to
justify
it
without
looking
to
any
wording
in
the
opinion
it
would
have
to
be
done
on
the
basis
of
some
provision
of
section
1915.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well
i
believe
that
the
basis
for
dismissing
without
knowing
the
basis
for
dismissing,
without
knowing
what
they
may
be
in
the
particular
case
would
have
to
be
assumed
to
have
been
done
properly
under
this
section.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
denial
of
the
entire
petition
your
honor
which
included
in
form
of
paupers
counsel
and
the
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
--
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
no.
his
petition
was
in
three
parts
your
honor,
in
form
--
petition
to
proceed
in
form
of
paupers,
appointment
of
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
that's
true
your
honor,
but
as
later
--
as
the
petition
states
later,
there
are
other
reasons
given
in
the
bear.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
considering
part
of
his
petition,
the
petition
was
denied
there's
no
question,
but
that
wasn't
the
only
point
of
his
petition.
he
actually
was
--
had
set
forth
his
entire
appeal.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
believe
that
assuming
that
the
court's
actions
were
according
to
statutory
authority
that
the
court
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
frivolity.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
to
the
extent
that
they
could
determine
from
the
record
presented
to
them
that
this
appeal
was
frivolous.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
no,
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
believe
sir.
i
believe
that
they
would
have.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
can
do
that
yes.
i
think
that
that's
the
question,
the
narrow
question
involved
and
i
think
that
the
argument
of
petitioner
is
that
there
is
discrimination
on
account
of
an
indigent
defendant
because
the
court,
under
section
1915
may
dismiss
for
--
on
the
basis
of
frivolity
sake.
whereas,
in
the
case
of
paid
counsel,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
opportunity
to
have
briefs
presented
and
argument
and
at
least
a
motion
by
someone
to
dismiss
before
he
were
denied
his
appeal.
and
i
think
that's
the
narrow
question
whether
there
is
--
whether
that
difference
in
treatment
of
indigent
defendants
and
treatment
of
defendants
with
paid
counsel
constitutes
a
constitutional
discrimination
against
indigent
defendants.
if
i
may,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
a
difference,
certainly,
indigent
defendants
are
handled
differently
--
the
petitions
of
indigent
defendants
are
handled
differently
than
are
the
petitions
of
defendants
with
paid
counsel,
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
discrimination.
i
don't
believe
the
difference
means
discrimination.
my
reason
for
that
is
that
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
brief
which
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
dismiss
on
motion
an
appeal.
it
may
request
in
fact
if
they
believe
there's
frivolity
in
the
appeal,
may
request
that
the
--
that
a
motion
be
filed
which
has
been
done
in
certain
courts
of
appeals.
so
that
the
end
result
is
that
the
defendant
with
paid
counsel
may
find
themselves
in
the
very
position
that
an
indigent
defendant
finds
himself
when
he
isn't
represented
in
argument
and
by
filing
a
briefs
before
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
is
possible
your
honor,
i
believe
yes.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
wouldn't
happen
in
the
same
way
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well
i
don't
know
this
2253
enters
into
this
part
of
it.
i
say
that
in
regard
to
with
defendant
with
a
paid
attorney,
he
may
be
able
to
file
briefs.
he
may
be
allowed
some
extra
proceedings,
but
the
end
result
without
ever
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
well
they
aren't
necessary
because
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
opportunity
is
greater
in
the
case
of
a
paid
attorney
for
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
is
very
important.
i
meant
to
say
that
the
end
result
without
ever
--a
review
could
be
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
without
ever
having
a
hearing,
without
briefs
being
submitted,
the
court
on
motion
could
dismiss.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
no,
there
can't
be
because
there's
no
one
on
the
other
side
at
this
point
your
honor,
i
agree.
i
say
that
in
the
case
of
a
paid
counsel
for
a
defendant,
you
may
have
the
same
result,
because
on
motion
of
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
that
the
case
be
dismissed
because
of
not
say
frivolity.
the
court
could
make
an
order
and
the
defendant
in
that
case,
even
with
his
paid
counsel,
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
this
indigent
have
been
of
this
here.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
there
are
differences
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
and
there
are
important
differences
as
justice
brennan
points
out.
but
i
say
that
because
there
are
those
differences,
doesn't
mean
that
there's
discrimination
against
an
indigent
defendant
on
account
of
his
indigency.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
was
filed
pro
se.
your
honor,
if
the
record
will
disclose
that
a
mr.
stooks
of
pittsburgh
had
represented
the
defendant
in
his
argument
before
the
district
court
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes,
and
the
district
court
have
ruled
and
the
attorney
had
filed
the
appeal
for
this
defendant,
but
then
asked
to
be
excused
before
the
--
before
any
further
proceedings
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes
had
filed
notice,
excuse
me.
and
was
excuse
by
the
court
before
any
proceedings
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
to
the
circuit
court?
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
there
was
no
notice
that
i
know.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
yes,
the
warden.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
that
the
appellant
has
to
notify
the
respondent
who
would
be
the
warden
on
this
one.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
your
honor,
not
that
i
know
of.
the
record
certainly
does
not
disclose
that.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
only
--
perhaps
i'm
mistaken,
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
if
the
court,
the
circuit
court,
had
considered
this
matter
and
justice
biggs
had
issued
an
order
that
it
would
be
a
docketed
matter.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
again,
because
of
the
--
i'm
not
sure
that
such
a
notice
was
ever
given.
we
have
no
record
of
it,
but
we
are
in
the
manner
of
--
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
that
yes,
i
think
that
1915
gives
at
par.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
i
think
that
the
third
circuit
has
a
record,
your
honor,
providing
counsel
of
giving
hearings.
i
think
that
this
is
somewhat
the
unusual.
if
i
may,
much
was
said
about
the
certificate
probable
cause
and
its
function.
under
2253,
where
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
made
a
requirement
of
appeal,
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
that
certificate
of
probable
cause
standing
on
its
own
does
not
mean
anything
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
as
to
--
as
it's
not
binding
in
anyway
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
pfadt
it
provides
--
that's
right
it's
a
requirement,
and
there
are
cases
which
hold
that
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
actually
is
nothing
more
than
that
the
trial
judge
believes
that
the
person
asking
for
this
is
sincere.
he
may
not
agree
with
him
and
obviously
he
doesn't
agree
with
him
because
he
just
ruled
against
him.
but
if
he
believes
that
he
has
a
sincere
argument
and
without
regard
to
the
merits,
then
he
will
grant
certificate
of
probable
cause
which
was
done
here,
because
judge
marsh
who
was
the
district
judge
presiding
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
the
one
who
granted
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
within
days
after
he
had
made
the
order
denying
this
man
his
writ.
to
go
back
to
what
i
said,
i
believe
that
it's
the
narrow
point
here.
does
section
1915
create
a
situation
where
an
indigent
defendant
is
discriminated
against
because
of
the
procedure
set
out
in
that
section,
as
opposed
to
what
a
defendant
with
paid
counsel
may
be
entitled
to
under
his
general
rights
to
appeal
in
the
procedures
in
the
court
of
appeals?
i
say
that
in
answer
to
that,
my
answer
to
the
problem
is
that
acknowledge
there
are
differences
but
denied
that
there
are
discriminatory
differences.
