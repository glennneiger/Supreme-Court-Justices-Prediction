justice
abe
fortas
mr.
o'hern,
do
you
know
whether
any
representations
are
made
to
the
court
prior
to
the
entry
of
judge
biggs,
chief
judge
biggs'
order
on
835
of
the
record.
what
happened
here
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
petitioner
applied
for
leave
to
proceed
in
the
form
of
paupers,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
order
signed
by
judge
biggs
denied
leave
to
appeal
in
the
form
of
paupers.
and
then
the
clerk's
letter
to
which
you
refer
were
as
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
after
that.
that
is
the
clerk
had
--
there's
one
thing
the
clerk
could
do
except
to
say
courts
denied
to
leave
file
in
the
form
of
paupers
so
if
you
want
to
file,
you
got
to
pay
the
usual
fee,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
was
any
representations
made
that
judge
biggs
said
this
fellow
is
not
a
pauper
or
something
like
that
that
you
know
of?
justice
abe
fortas
that
he
was
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
there's
no
issue
here.this
surprise
me
a
bit,
the
application
for
leave
seems
a
form
of
paupers
is
filed
july
16,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
judge
biggs'
order
is
entered
in
july
27,
and
there's
no
indication
of
why
he
entered
the
order.
no
indication
that
any
state
--
that
any
thing
is
filed
by
the
state's
attorney
in
our
position
or
what
not,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
so
we
must
--
i
suppose
that
would
be
testified
here
in
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
disagreed
with
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
characters
substantiality
of
the
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
facts
of
the
issue
before
us.
now
do
you
also
think
that
we
have
before
us
the
question
of
the
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
it
says
in
page
135
of
the
record
it
says
“present
biggs,
plager
and
freidman.
