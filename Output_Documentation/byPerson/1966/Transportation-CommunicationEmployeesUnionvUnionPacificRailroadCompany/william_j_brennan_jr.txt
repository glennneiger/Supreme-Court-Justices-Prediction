j.
brennan,

now,
i'm
sure
there
must
be
instances
of
disagreement
over
what
may
be
controlling
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
ordinary
labor
arbitration,
and
you
have
got
lot
of
experience
in
this,
is
that
valid
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
would
suppose
--
.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
“cut
that
shorter”.
what
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
old
common
law
pleading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
clerk's
vice-president
was
a
member
of
the
tribunal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
i
don't
understand,
mr.
kraemer.
you
say
they
can't
force
the
clerks
in
because
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
how
do
they
have
jurisdiction
if
they
are
invited
in
and
they
come
in?
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
is
it
the
--
what
function
does
the
clerk
serve
that
they
did
come
in
--
would
they
have
said
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
telegraphers
doesn't
cover
because
our
contract
does.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
like
the
clerks
would
be
paid
if
you
won
--
while
the
clerks
did
the
work,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
strikers
would
be
paid
for
not
doing
the
work
while
the
clerks
are
being
paid
for
the
work.

j.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
funny
way
to
run
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wilcox,
did
you
ask
the
board
to
bring
the
clerks
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
got
to
use
your
argument
is,
am
i
correct,
wilcox,
that
statement
is
inconsistent
with
the
holding
in
the
pitney
and
slocum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
this,
mr.
wilcox,
if
the
clerks
were
in
this
case
and
could
be
forced
into
it,
what
would
be
the
composition
of
the
tribunal?
we've
been
told
that
ordinarily
you
get
five
of
the
union
and
five,
is
that
right?
a
division
is
five
union
representatives
and
five
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
kraemer
say
that
if
they
were
forced
inevitably,
the
railroad
would
decide
which
would
win
because
the
union
at
the
railroad
picked
out,
would
vote
for
the
railroad
and
thus
--
it
would
be
to
one.
how
would
that
come
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
could
it
come
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
want
to
get
cleared
is
that
the
union
members
always
include
a
representative
of
the
union
staff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
he
is
just
a
labor
representative.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
carrier
is
supposed
to
be
a
carrier
generally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let
me
get
that.
in
other
words,
what
you're
telling
me
if
you
had
them
both
in,
what
ultimately
would
happen
when
you
said
the
impartial
referee
is
a
single
individual
would
be
more
or
less
the
arbiter
finally,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
they
didn't?
well
i
can't
--
i
don't
quite
understand
–
how
can
the
telegraphers
or
the
clerks
be
the
victim
of
the
choice
of
the
railroad
that
has
to
be
because
you
don't
bring
in
impartial
referee
in
it.
