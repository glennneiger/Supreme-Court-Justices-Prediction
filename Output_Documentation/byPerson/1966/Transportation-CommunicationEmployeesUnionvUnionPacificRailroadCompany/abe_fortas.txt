justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
carrier
argued
that
it
was
covered
by
clerk's
agreement
you
would
think
the
carrier
would
have
something
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
to
argue
from
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
you
don't
know
whether
it
was
there
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kraemer,
did
the
railroad
object
before
the
board
--
i
know
these
proceedings
are
little
baffling
--
may
be
they
don't
object
but
did
they
in
some
way
manifest
their
objection
to
the
proceedings
before
the
board
in
the
absence
of
the
clerks.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
his
letter
which
is
on
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
clerks
responded
and
said
“no,
thank
you”.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
objection
taken
and
whether
the
forum
by
the
railroad
be
arrested?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
the
railroad
just
went
ahead
after
that
in
the
absence
of
the
clerks
--
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
merits.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
the
point
though
that
this
is
not
an
arbitration
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
not
an
arbitration
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
the
board
has
the
power
to
make
rules.
justice
abe
fortas
the
board's
function
is
confined
to
construing
contract,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
with
whom
does
the
railroad
statute
(inaudible)
as
a
result
of
this
suit,
reduction
in
the
force.
justice
abe
fortas
the
labor
policy
then
--
posed
nevertheless
somebody
makes
a
mistake
and
you
have
two
collective
bargaining
contracts
that
cover
the
same
work
as
the
adjustment
board
have
power
to
resolve
the
conflict.
then
it's
got
the
power
to
say
that
the
reason
in
contract
a
shall
be
disregarded.
and
that
contract
b
--
employees
in
contract
b
can
get
the
work.
it
seems
to
me
and
really
hard
to
believe
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
but
let's
suppose
that
--
these
contracts
are
explicit
or
ambiguity
is
resolved
so
that
both
contracts
cover
the
same
work.
now,
you
are
telling
me
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
adjustment
board
would
have
power
to
overriding
one
of
the
contracts.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
on
clearly
the
lawyers
mind
is
a
wonderful
thing.[laughter]
justice

did
that
court

justice

how
many
