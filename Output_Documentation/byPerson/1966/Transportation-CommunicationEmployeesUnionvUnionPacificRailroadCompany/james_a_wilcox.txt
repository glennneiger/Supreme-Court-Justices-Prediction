mr.
james
a.
wilcox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
quite
understandable
why
the
telegraphers
here
and
other
unions
in
other
cases
are
very
anxious
that
this
case
be
reversed.
they've
got
a
good
thing
going.
they
don't
care
as
long
as
we
have
the
clerk's
perform
the
work
and
they
and
the
telegraphers
get
paid,
they've
got
a
real
fine
chance
of
continuing
this
horrible
what
i
call
a
horrible
scandal.
we
call
it
the
railroad
double
payrolling.
and
the
four
regions
of
this
case
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
mr.
justice
white,
in
the
railroad
industry
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
we
can
serve
such
as
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary.
we
believe
that
the
adjustment
board
has
the
full
power
and
the
full
jurisdiction
and
the
duty
to
resolve
these
work
assignment
disputes.
there
is
no
need
to
serve
a
section
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
i
should
find
out
to
you
right
away.
but
we
are
not
speaking
of
the
explicit/unambiguous
agreements.
these
agreements
simply
describe
a
job
and
the
clerks
come
along
and
tell
us
that
this
is
clerks
work.
the
telegraphers
come
along
and
tell
us
that
this
is
telegraphers
work.
and
when
we
denied
the
claim,
they
progress
it
to
the
board
as
simply
a
dispute
under
the
clerks
agreement
or
under
the
telegrapher's
agreement,
and
refused
to
recognize
that
any
other
party
has
any
interest.
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
ever
since
1934,
the
adjustment
board
was
given
this
power
and
the
duty
to
resolve
work
assignment
disputes.
indeed,
this
court,
in
a
very
early
case,
the
pitney
case,
326
u.s.
was
just
as
black
speaking
for
on
that
point
a
unanimous
court,
held
that
the
n.r.a.b.
--
the
adjustment
board,
had
jurisdiction
over
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
and
i'm
quoting,
involving
the
railroad
and
two
employee
accredited
bargaining
agents.
mr.
justice
black
also
stated
that
the
board
was
specially
creative
to
interpret
contracts
such
as
these
in
order
finally
to
settle
a
labor
dispute.
a
few
years
later
in
the
slocum
case
again,
mr.
justice
black,
he
said
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
in
these
work
assignment
disputes
was
exclusive.
this
court
in
the
slocum
case
was
presented
with
the
precise
dispute
that
you
have
before
you.
in
that
case,
the
clerks
and
the
telegraphers
were
each
claiming,
respectively,
that
their
ambiguous
contract
covered
in
the
work
in
question.
the
railroad
got
a
little
tired
of
this
and
went
into
a
new
york
state
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
new
york
court
affirmed
for,
i
believe,
the
clerks
and
the
telegraphers
obtained
certiorari
from
this
court.
the
question
presented
there
was
whether
or
not
the
courts
should
have
jurisdiction
over
these
type
of
disputes
which
depend
for
their
resolution
on
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
agreement.
and
this
court
in
slocum
said
that
the
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
but
went
ahead
to
point
out
that
the
adjustment
board
does
have
jurisdiction?
indeed,
in
our
brief,
we
haven't
the
exact
page,
we
quoted
from
the
telegraphers'
brief
before
this
court
in
slocum
in
which
they
told
this
court
that
the
adjustment
board
has
jurisdiction
over
all
the
parties.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
we
did.
that's
what
i
was
going
to
cover
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
our
first
submission
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
record
as
the
page
just
mentioned
by
mr.
kraemer
appeared
what
we
call
the
railroad
and
the
union's
first
submission.
then
there
are
other
responding
submissions.
but
only
the
first
submission
of
each
party
is
included
in
the
record
and
included
in
the
printed
award.
and
at
page
35,
you
will
notice
that
the
carrier,
the
union
pacific,
pointed
out
that
for
the
board
to
sustain
these
claims
would
be
to
deny
the
clerk
employees
their
rights
to
perform
the
work
would
abrogate
the
agreement
negotiated
between
the
carrier
and
the
clerk's
organization
and
would
seriously
affect
by
such
action
the
rights
of
clerk
employees.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
page
–
this
is
in
our
first
submission
or
brief
to
the
adjustment
board
in
this
dispute,
page
35
of
the
record.
now,
petitioner
challenges
the
board's
jurisdiction
and
the
controlling
effect
of
slocum
and
pitney
by
relying
entirely
upon
one
of
the
perplexing
questions
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
placed
in
the
white
house
opinion,
a
question
incidentally
which
he
never
answered
and
which,
of
course,
would
be
dictum.
the
question
that
has
not
been
answered
since.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
while
white
house
asked
many
questions,
if
answered
none
of
them,
except
that,
that
case
like
the
carrie
case
was
a
premature
matter
and
that
the
matter
should
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
reading
that
in
context,
mr.
justice
white,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
telegraphers
and
the
railroad,
yes.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
clerks
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir,
notice
to
them.
i
take
that
statement
to
mean
that
the
board
did
have
jurisdiction.
in
the
event
it
issued
a
denial
award
namely
denying
the
telegrapher's
claim.
in
the
same
fashion
in
your
carrie
case
recently
arbitration
should
proceed
which
went
ahead
to
point
out
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
think
that
they
can
be
compulsorily
joined.
i
think
the
board
has
been
given
the
power
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
this
is
right
where
we
join
issue,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
you
would
not.
that
is
not
the
holding
of
white
house.
those
were
a
series
of
questions
that
are
dictum
statements
that
justice
frankfurter
made.
the
only
holding
in
white
house
was
that
the
injunction
which
the
railroad
has
obtained
against
the
board
proceeding
any
further
because
of
failure
to
give
notice
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
board
should
proceed
to
determine
that
dispute.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
white
house?
well,
yes.
i
have
no
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
of
course,
absolutely.
the
petitioner's
crucial
argument
here
is
that
the
union
pacific
may
have
bound
itself
by
contract
in
the
same
work
to
both
clerks
and
telegraphers.
it
is
our
position
and
we
think
quite
clear
under
the
law
that
this
is
not
possible
under
the
national
labor
policy.
it
may
be
impossible
as
a
common-law
but
it
is
not
under
the
national
labor
policy
as
spelled
out
in
sections
2,
2nd,
3rd,
4th
and
9th
of
the
act,
especially
2.9.
briefly
that
section
provides
that
a
carrier
upon
receiving
a
union
certification
as
a
representative
of
some
of
its
employees,
the
carrier
shall
treat
with
the
representative
as
so
certified
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
from
the
earliest
back
in
1937,
this
court
said
that
2/9th
of
the
railway
labor
act
imposes
the
affirmative
duty
on
the
railroad
to
treat
only
with
the
true
representative
and
the
negative
duty
to
treat
with
no
others.
this
court
re-stated
that
in
the
general
committee
case
at
320
u.s.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
railroad
here
says
that
it's
the
(inaudible)
the
clerks.
we
feel
that
we
made
the
correct
assignment
of
this
work.
and,
we
also
feel
that
that
for
the
telegraphers
to
obtain
via
an
interpretation
of
their
agreement
and
alleged
an
exclusive
right
to
this
work
is
simply
contrary
to
the
labor
policy
because
we
could
not
vote.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
as
i
stated
earlier,
we
are
not
dealing
with
explicit
contracts;
we
are
dealing
with
ambiguous
contracts.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
it
wouldn't
be
overriding
the
contract,
mr.
justice
powell.
we
would
be
interpreting
it
--
accommodating
it
-
and
that
furthers
the
labor
piece
which
the
act
speaks.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
first
of
all
i
should
point
out
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
not
the
case
before
us
--
but
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
only
if
are
willing
to
ascribe
an
ulterior
intent
to
the
railroad
industry
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
do.
we
don't
do
business
that
way.
secondly,
we
would
be
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it
would
be
a
most
flagrant
violation
of
section
2
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
requires
us
under
the
virginian
decision
to
treat
with
the
true
accredited
representative
and
no
other
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
section
2
has
some
penal
sanction
--
i
don't
know.
it
has
some
penal
sanctions
--
it
could
also
be
enjoined
i
would
imagine.
we
have
no
right
to
bargain
with
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
that
should
occur,
it
would
certainly
be
tracked
from
the
integrity
of
bargaining
but
bear
in
mind
that
only
one
of
those
two
unions
is
entitled
to
the
work.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
we
must.
under
the
law
we
can
only
deal
with
the
true
unions.
the
other
union
--
the
other
representative
would
even
have
a
right
to
serve
section
6
for
the
work
which
the
other
--
for
example
the
clerks
have
the
right
to
perform.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
without
the
possibility
of
creating
a
lot
of
strike,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
worked
out
at
the
bargaining
table.
we're
not
--
we're
going
to
get
either
of
the
two
unions
to
agree
that
the
work
belongs
to
the
other.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
would
depend,
sir,
on
whether
they're
--
who
they
represent
and
the
scope
of
their
representation.
clerks
would
represent
clerical
work.
telegraphers
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
clerk's
organization
would
represent
employees
performing
clerical
work.
the
signalman's
organization
represents
employees
performing
signal
work
which
i
think
answered
that
question.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
now
that
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
decided
by
the
authority
of
the
clerk
representative.
in
other
words,
the
signalman,
for
example,
has
the
authority
under
the
law
to
represent
signal
employee,
i.e.
those
that
perform
signal
work.
the
only
place
where
we
get
into
trouble
is
in
the
clerical-telegrapher
field
because
there
even
a
telegrapher
does
performs
some
clerical
work
and
we
get
this
cross.
and
as
a
result
the
clerks
and
the
telegraphers
have
dreamed
up
this
what
we
call
“double
barreling”
-–
one
goes
the
board,
gets
its
claim
sustained
then
the
other
goes
to
the
board
for
the
same
work,
gets
that
claim
sustained.
indeed,
the
mkt
railroad
had,
i
believe
four
or
five
enforcement
actions
pending
against
it
in
different
courts
by
the
clerks
and
telegraphers
on
the
same
work.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
if
the
award
is
enforced
as
it
was
sustained
by
the
adjustment
board,
the
union
pacific
will
be
forced
to
pay
a
telegrapher
around
the
clock
-
that
would
be
three
telegraphers
a
day
all
the
way
back
to
1951.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
continuing
according
to
the
claim,
until
the
violation
is
corrected.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
is
not
the
real
answer.
that
only
invites
further
strike.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
don't
run
out
but
we
could
speak
to
amend
them.
i
have
a
little
doubt
that
the
telegraphers
would
not
give
this
out.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
and
five
railroad.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it
would
remain
the
same.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
if
it
did,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it
could
come
about,
yes.
if
the
telegraphers
progressed
a
clerks
claim
for
clerical
work
to
the
adjustment
board,
the
clerks'
representative
on
the
board
would
lawfully
vote
for
the
five
carrier
men.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
composition
of
the
board
is
not
based
upon
union
membership.
there
were
to
be
five
labor
members
and
five
carrier
members.
indeed,
there's
a
legislative
history
to
the
fact
that
it
was
never
intended
that
any
--
whether
the
clerks'
vice-president
was
on
the
board
or
not.
it
was
not
intended
that
he
represents
solely
clerk's
interest.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
he
is
just
a
labor
representative.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
our
appendices
to
our
brief,
we
have
attached
evidence
showing
the
arrangement
that
the
labor
executives
had
for
progressing
these
claims
under
a
single
contract
theory,
and
the
arrangement
in
appendix
c,
indicates
that
they
will
let
this
dispute
go
to
a
referee.
now,
should
this
situation
occur
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
could
let
him
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
there
would
be
am
an
impartial
referee
here
if
the
labor
unions
want
it.
all
they
would
do
is
to
join
together
with
5
votes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
they
don't,
that's
their
own
doing.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
and
that
is
exactly,
sir,
what
happened,
a
number
of
years
ago,
the
telegrapher's
(inaudible)
voted
with
the
railroad
and
he
was
quickly
taken
off
the
board
and
ever
since
then,
then
the
labor
members
voted
as
a
union
;
block
voting
and
by
that
simple
device,
they
can
continue
to
get
the
neutral
to
decide
and
resolve
this
dispute.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
the
partisan
members
served
at
the
pleasure
of
their
employer,
the
labor
members
of
the
labor
organization.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
not
necessarily.
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
over
nine,
the
telegraphers
man
is
off
the
board
because
he
voted
with
the
railroad
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
practice
they
can
do
take
him
off
anytime.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
they
stay
for
quite
a
little
while.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
the
board
is
permanent
and
the
referee
is
generally
--
well
they
are
picked
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
for
a
docket
of
say,
30
cases.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
if
the
board
was
told
to
performance
duty,
the
clerks
would
be
in
there
very
short
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
this
court
affirms
pitney
and
slocum
and
tells
this
board,
this
adjustment
board,
to
perform
a
duty
that
congress
intended
of
it,
i
can
assure
you
that
the
union
performing
the
work,
the
clerks
in
this
case,
will
be
in
there
to
protect
that
work.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
stayed
out.
and
we've
talked
about
mr.
kraemer's
argues
that
we
are
asking
for
10k.
it's
our
position
that
we
had
10k
all
the
time
but
because
of
these
devices
have
not
been
able
to
utilize
it.
however,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
when
10k
was
before
the
court,
before
the
congress
--
representative
gerald
w
landis
--
on
the
floor
stated,
“this
conference
report
will
take
care
of
labor
abuses
without
destroying
laborers'
rights.
it
completely
outlaws
jurisdictional
strikes,
wild
cat
strikes
and
secondary
boycott.
these
are
labor
evils
and
not
laborer's
rights.
in
order
to
stop
the
strikes
which
threaten
the
national
welfare,

ways
–-
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
we
have
set
up
a
plan
in
many
ways
like
the
railway
labor
act.
from
the
earlier,
the
adjustment
board
has
had
this
jurisdiction
and
should
exercise
it.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
membership,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
board
will
not
change
whatever
this
court
does
in
this
case.
the
third
division
where
this
case
was
before,
it
was
a
permanent;
you
call
a
permanent
board
although
they
are
subject
to
removal
by
their
own
employer.
five
labor
members
and
five
carrier
members,
each
side
paying
their
own
members,
and
those
would
be
of
the
same
union,
of
their
union.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
don't
have
to
be
no.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
it
wasn't
intended
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
can
be--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
often
are.
the
third
division,
however,
has
i
believe
jurisdiction
over
12
crafts
--
that
would
be
12
different
unions.
we
have
only
five
unions
here
represented
on
the
board.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
all
operating
together,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
if
they
can't
pick
them
in,
then
the
national
mediation
board
picks
a
man
from
that
side
of
the
table.
in
the
same
respect
that
if
a
carrier
fails
for
30
days
to
appoint
a
member
of
the
board,
the
mediation
board
does
if
for
us.
and
that's
the
same
way
with
the
labor
members.
in
practice,
however,
this
organization
or
as
a
railway
labor
executive
organization,
they
pick
the
membership.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
all
railroad
unions.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
except
i
believe
the
engineers,
but
all
the
non-operating
--
indeed,
it's
essentially
--
more
of
it
in
the
non-operating
field.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
perhaps,
i
--
it
would
be
up
to
deliver
union
labors.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
oh!
no,
it
would
not
be
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
could
happen
and
it
could
be
perfectly
lawful.
but
as
i
stated,
it
was
never
intended
that
any
member
of
the
board
look
after
only
one
certain
interest.
in
other
words,
the
labor
union
members
have
the
duty
to
look
after
the
whole
of
the
labor
union
side.
and
if
they
want
to
avoid
this,
it
would
be
simple
matter
for
the
five
labor
members
and
the
five
carrier
members.
it's
a
deadlock
and
allow
this
to
go
a
neutral
for
a
decision,
which
is
exactly
their
practice
today
as
we
outlined
in
appendix
c.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes.
they
have
up
to
now.
the
only
time
as
i
pointed
out
that
they
didn't
when
the
telegrapher
member
on
the
board
voted
with
a
railroad
to
deny
a
clerk's
claim;
that
night,
he
was
removed
from
the
board
in
emergency
session
–
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
railway
labor
executives
meeting
and
took
him
off
the
board.
for
a
number
of
years,
the
telegraphers
did
not
have
a
representative
on
the
board.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yeah,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
perfectly
valid
decision.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
am
fairly
familiar
with
the
board's
docket
and
i
would
say
that
the
third
division,
which
is
the
one
you
are
merely
concerned
with,
is
approximate
2
½
years
behind.
but
it
is
fast
catching
up.
responsible
people
on
our
side
of
the
table
indicate
that
within
a
year-and-a-half,
they
should
be
on
a
current
basis
of
say
6
months.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
four,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
quite
understandable
why
the
telegraphers
here
and
other
unions
in
other
cases
are
very
anxious
that
this
case
be
reversed.
they've
got
a
good
thing
going.
they
don't
care
as
long
as
we
have
the
clerk's
perform
the
work
and
they
and
the
telegraphers
get
paid,
they've
got
a
real
fine
chance
of
continuing
this
horrible
what
i
call
a
horrible
scandal.
we
call
it
the
railroad
double
payrolling.
and
the
four
regions
of
this
case
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
mr.
justice
white,
in
the
railroad
industry
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
we
can
serve
such
as
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary.
we
believe
that
the
adjustment
board
has
the
full
power
and
the
full
jurisdiction
and
the
duty
to
resolve
these
work
assignment
disputes.
there
is
no
need
to
serve
a
section
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
i
should
find
out
to
you
right
away.
but
we
are
not
speaking
of
the
explicit/unambiguous
agreements.
these
agreements
simply
describe
a
job
and
the
clerks
come
along
and
tell
us
that
this
is
clerks
work.
the
telegraphers
come
along
and
tell
us
that
this
is
telegraphers
work.
and
when
we
denied
the
claim,
they
progress
it
to
the
board
as
simply
a
dispute
under
the
clerks
agreement
or
under
the
telegrapher's
agreement,
and
refused
to
recognize
that
any
other
party
has
any
interest.
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
ever
since
1934,
the
adjustment
board
was
given
this
power
and
the
duty
to
resolve
work
assignment
disputes.
indeed,
this
court,
in
a
very
early
case,
the
pitney
case,
326
u.s.
was
just
as
black
speaking
for
on
that
point
a
unanimous
court,
held
that
the
n.r.a.b.
--
the
adjustment
board,
had
jurisdiction
over
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
and
i'm
quoting,
involving
the
railroad
and
two
employee
accredited
bargaining
agents.
mr.
justice
black
also
stated
that
the
board
was
specially
creative
to
interpret
contracts
such
as
these
in
order
finally
to
settle
a
labor
dispute.
a
few
years
later
in
the
slocum
case
again,
mr.
justice
black,
he
said
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
in
these
work
assignment
disputes
was
exclusive.
this
court
in
the
slocum
case
was
presented
with
the
precise
dispute
that
you
have
before
you.
in
that
case,
the
clerks
and
the
telegraphers
were
each
claiming,
respectively,
that
their
ambiguous
contract
covered
in
the
work
in
question.
the
railroad
got
a
little
tired
of
this
and
went
into
a
new
york
state
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
new
york
court
affirmed
for,
i
believe,
the
clerks
and
the
telegraphers
obtained
certiorari
from
this
court.
the
question
presented
there
was
whether
or
not
the
courts
should
have
jurisdiction
over
these
type
of
disputes
which
depend
for
their
resolution
on
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
agreement.
and
this
court
in
slocum
said
that
the
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
but
went
ahead
to
point
out
that
the
adjustment
board
does
have
jurisdiction?
indeed,
in
our
brief,
we
haven't
the
exact
page,
we
quoted
from
the
telegraphers'
brief
before
this
court
in
slocum
in
which
they
told
this
court
that
the
adjustment
board
has
jurisdiction
over
all
the
parties.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
we
did.
that's
what
i
was
going
to
cover
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
our
first
submission
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
record
as
the
page
just
mentioned
by
mr.
kraemer
appeared
what
we
call
the
railroad
and
the
union's
first
submission.
then
there
are
other
responding
submissions.
but
only
the
first
submission
of
each
party
is
included
in
the
record
and
included
in
the
printed
award.
and
at
page
35,
you
will
notice
that
the
carrier,
the
union
pacific,
pointed
out
that
for
the
board
to
sustain
these
claims
would
be
to
deny
the
clerk
employees
their
rights
to
perform
the
work
would
abrogate
the
agreement
negotiated
between
the
carrier
and
the
clerk's
organization
and
would
seriously
affect
by
such
action
the
rights
of
clerk
employees.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox

–
this
is
in
our
first
submission
or
brief
to
the
adjustment
board
in
this
dispute,
page
35
of
the
record.
now,
petitioner
challenges
the
board's
jurisdiction
and
the
controlling
effect
of
slocum
and
pitney
by
relying
entirely
upon
one
of
the
perplexing
questions
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
placed
in
the
white
house
opinion,
a
question
incidentally
which
he
never
answered
and
which,
of
course,
would
be
dictum.
the
question
that
has
not
been
answered
since.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
while
white
house
asked
many
questions,
if
answered
none
of
them,
except
that,
that
case
like
the
carrie
case
was
a
premature
matter
and
that
the
matter
should
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
reading
that
in
context,
mr.
justice
white,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
telegraphers
and
the
railroad,
yes.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
clerks
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir,
notice
to
them.
i
take
that
statement
to
mean
that
the
board
did
have
jurisdiction.
in
the
event
it
issued
a
denial
award
namely
denying
the
telegrapher's
claim.
in
the
same
fashion
in
your
carrie
case
recently
arbitration
should
proceed
which
went
ahead
to
point
out
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
think
that
they
can
be
compulsorily
joined.
i
think
the
board
has
been
given
the
power
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
this
is
right
where
we
join
issue,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
you
would
not.
that
is
not
the
holding
of
white
house.
those
were
a
series
of
questions
that
are
dictum
statements
that
justice
frankfurter
made.
the
only
holding
in
white
house
was
that
the
injunction
which
the
railroad
has
obtained
against
the
board
proceeding
any
further
because
of
failure
to
give
notice
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
board
should
proceed
to
determine
that
dispute.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
white
house?
well,
yes.
i
have
no
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
of
course,
absolutely.
the
petitioner's
crucial
argument
here
is
that
the
union
pacific
may
have
bound
itself
by
contract
in
the
same
work
to
both
clerks
and
telegraphers.
it
is
our
position
and
we
think
quite
clear
under
the
law
that
this
is
not
possible
under
the
national
labor
policy.
it
may
be
impossible
as
a
common-law
but
it
is
not
under
the
national
labor
policy
as
spelled
out
in
sections
2,
2nd,
3rd,
4th
and
9th
of
the
act,
especially
2.9.
briefly
that
section
provides
that
a
carrier
upon
receiving
a
union
certification
as
a
representative
of
some
of
its
employees,
the
carrier
shall
treat
with
the
representative
as
so
certified
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
from
the
earliest
back
in
1937,
this
court
said
that
2/9th
of
the
railway
labor
act
imposes
the
affirmative
duty
on
the
railroad
to
treat
only
with
the
true
representative
and
the
negative
duty
to
treat
with
no
others.
this
court
re-stated
that
in
the
general
committee
case
at
320
u.s.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
railroad
here
says
that
it's
the
(inaudible)
the
clerks.
we
feel
that
we
made
the
correct
assignment
of
this
work.
and,
we
also
feel
that
that
for
the
telegraphers
to
obtain
via
an
interpretation
of
their
agreement
and
alleged
an
exclusive
right
to
this
work
is
simply
contrary
to
the
labor
policy
because
we
could
not
vote.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
as
i
stated
earlier,
we
are
not
dealing
with
explicit
contracts;
we
are
dealing
with
ambiguous
contracts.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
it
wouldn't
be
overriding
the
contract,
mr.
justice
powell.
we
would
be
interpreting
it
--
accommodating
it
-
and
that
furthers
the
labor
piece
which
the
act
speaks.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
first
of
all
i
should
point
out
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
not
the
case
before
us
--
but
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
only
if
are
willing
to
ascribe
an
ulterior
intent
to
the
railroad
industry
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
do.
we
don't
do
business
that
way.
secondly,
we
would
be
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it
would
be
a
most
flagrant
violation
of
section
2
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
requires
us
under
the
virginian
decision
to
treat
with
the
true
accredited
representative
and
no
other
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
section
2
has
some
penal
sanction
--
i
don't
know.
it
has
some
penal
sanctions
--
it
could
also
be
enjoined
i
would
imagine.
we
have
no
right
to
bargain
with
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
that
should
occur,
it
would
certainly
be
tracked
from
the
integrity
of
bargaining
but
bear
in
mind
that
only
one
of
those
two
unions
is
entitled
to
the
work.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
we
must.
under
the
law
we
can
only
deal
with
the
true
unions.
the
other
union
--
the
other
representative
would
even
have
a
right
to
serve
section
6
for
the
work
which
the
other
--
for
example
the
clerks
have
the
right
to
perform.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
without
the
possibility
of
creating
a
lot
of
strike,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
worked
out
at
the
bargaining
table.
we're
not
--
we're
going
to
get
either
of
the
two
unions
to
agree
that
the
work
belongs
to
the
other.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
would
depend,
sir,
on
whether
they're
--
who
they
represent
and
the
scope
of
their
representation.
clerks
would
represent
clerical
work.
telegraphers
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
clerk's
organization
would
represent
employees
performing
clerical
work.
the
signalman's
organization
represents
employees
performing
signal
work
which
i
think
answered
that
question.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
now
that
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
decided
by
the
authority
of
the
clerk
representative.
in
other
words,
the
signalman,
for
example,
has
the
authority
under
the
law
to
represent
signal
employee,
i.e.
those
that
perform
signal
work.
the
only
place
where
we
get
into
trouble
is
in
the
clerical-telegrapher
field
because
there
even
a
telegrapher
does
performs
some
clerical
work
and
we
get
this
cross.
and
as
a
result
the
clerks
and
the
telegraphers
have
dreamed
up
this
what
we
call
“double
barreling”
-–
one
goes
the
board,
gets
its
claim
sustained
then
the
other
goes
to
the
board
for
the
same
work,
gets
that
claim
sustained.
indeed,
the
mkt
railroad
had,
i
believe
four
or
five
enforcement
actions
pending
against
it
in
different
courts
by
the
clerks
and
telegraphers
on
the
same
work.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
if
the
award
is
enforced
as
it
was
sustained
by
the
adjustment
board,
the
union
pacific
will
be
forced
to
pay
a
telegrapher
around
the
clock
-
that
would
be
three
telegraphers
a
day
all
the
way
back
to
1951.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
continuing
according
to
the
claim,
until
the
violation
is
corrected.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
is
not
the
real
answer.
that
only
invites
further
strike.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
don't
run
out
but
we
could
speak
to
amend
them.
i
have
a
little
doubt
that
the
telegraphers
would
not
give
this
out.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
and
five
railroad.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it
would
remain
the
same.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
if
it
did,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it
could
come
about,
yes.
if
the
telegraphers
progressed
a
clerks
claim
for
clerical
work
to
the
adjustment
board,
the
clerks'
representative
on
the
board
would
lawfully
vote
for
the
five
carrier
men.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
composition
of
the
board
is
not
based
upon
union
membership.
there
were
to
be
five
labor
members
and
five
carrier
members.
indeed,
there's
a
legislative
history
to
the
fact
that
it
was
never
intended
that
any
--
whether
the
clerks'
vice-president
was
on
the
board
or
not.
it
was
not
intended
that
he
represents
solely
clerk's
interest.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
he
is
just
a
labor
representative.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
our
appendices
to
our
brief,
we
have
attached
evidence
showing
the
arrangement
that
the
labor
executives
had
for
progressing
these
claims
under
a
single
contract
theory,
and
the
arrangement
in
appendix
c,
indicates
that
they
will
let
this
dispute
go
to
a
referee.
now,
should
this
situation
occur
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
could
let
him
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
there
would
be
am
an
impartial
referee
here
if
the
labor
unions
want
it.
all
they
would
do
is
to
join
together
with
5
votes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
they
don't,
that's
their
own
doing.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
and
that
is
exactly,
sir,
what
happened,
a
number
of
years
ago,
the
telegrapher's
(inaudible)
voted
with
the
railroad
and
he
was
quickly
taken
off
the
board
and
ever
since
then,
then
the
labor
members
voted
as
a
union
;
block
voting
and
by
that
simple
device,
they
can
continue
to
get
the
neutral
to
decide
and
resolve
this
dispute.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
the
partisan
members
served
at
the
pleasure
of
their
employer,
the
labor
members
of
the
labor
organization.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
not
necessarily.
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
over
nine,
the
telegraphers
man
is
off
the
board
because
he
voted
with
the
railroad
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
practice
they
can
do
take
him
off
anytime.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
they
stay
for
quite
a
little
while.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
the
board
is
permanent
and
the
referee
is
generally
--
well
they
are
picked
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
for
a
docket
of
say,
30
cases.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
if
the
board
was
told
to
performance
duty,
the
clerks
would
be
in
there
very
short
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
this
court
affirms
pitney
and
slocum
and
tells
this
board,
this
adjustment
board,
to
perform
a
duty
that
congress
intended
of
it,
i
can
assure
you
that
the
union
performing
the
work,
the
clerks
in
this
case,
will
be
in
there
to
protect
that
work.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
stayed
out.
and
we've
talked
about
mr.
kraemer's
argues
that
we
are
asking
for
10k.
it's
our
position
that
we
had
10k
all
the
time
but
because
of
these
devices
have
not
been
able
to
utilize
it.
however,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
when
10k
was
before
the
court,
before
the
congress
--
representative
gerald
w
landis
--
on
the
floor
stated,
“this
conference
report
will
take
care
of
labor
abuses
without
destroying
laborers'
rights.
it
completely
outlaws
jurisdictional
strikes,
wild
cat
strikes
and
secondary
boycott.
these
are
labor
evils
and
not
laborer's
rights.
in
order
to
stop
the
strikes
which
threaten
the
national
welfare,
we
have
set
up
a
plan,
referring
to
10k
like
the
railway
labor
act
in
many
ways
–-
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
we
have
set
up
a
plan
in
many
ways
like
the
railway
labor
act.
from
the
earlier,
the
adjustment
board
has
had
this
jurisdiction
and
should
exercise
it.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
membership,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
board
will
not
change
whatever
this
court
does
in
this
case.
the
third
division
where
this
case
was
before,
it
was
a
permanent;
you
call
a
permanent
board
although
they
are
subject
to
removal
by
their
own
employer.
five
labor
members
and
five
carrier
members,
each
side
paying
their
own
members,
and
those
would
be
of
the
same
union,
of
their
union.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
don't
have
to
be
no.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
it
wasn't
intended
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
can
be--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
they
often
are.
the
third
division,
however,
has
i
believe
jurisdiction
over
12
crafts
--
that
would
be
12
different
unions.
we
have
only
five
unions
here
represented
on
the
board.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
all
operating
together,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
if
they
can't
pick
them
in,
then
the
national
mediation
board
picks
a
man
from
that
side
of
the
table.
in
the
same
respect
that
if
a
carrier
fails
for
30
days
to
appoint
a
member
of
the
board,
the
mediation
board
does
if
for
us.
and
that's
the
same
way
with
the
labor
members.
in
practice,
however,
this
organization
or
as
a
railway
labor
executive
organization,
they
pick
the
membership.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
all
railroad
unions.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
except
i
believe
the
engineers,
but
all
the
non-operating
--
indeed,
it's
essentially
--
more
of
it
in
the
non-operating
field.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
perhaps,
i
--
it
would
be
up
to
deliver
union
labors.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
oh!
no,
it
would
not
be
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
could
happen
and
it
could
be
perfectly
lawful.
but
as
i
stated,
it
was
never
intended
that
any
member
of
the
board
look
after
only
one
certain
interest.
in
other
words,
the
labor
union
members
have
the
duty
to
look
after
the
whole
of
the
labor
union
side.
and
if
they
want
to
avoid
this,
it
would
be
simple
matter
for
the
five
labor
members
and
the
five
carrier
members.
it's
a
deadlock
and
allow
this
to
go
a
neutral
for
a
decision,
which
is
exactly
their
practice
today
as
we
outlined
in
appendix
c.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes.
they
have
up
to
now.
the
only
time
as
i
pointed
out
that
they
didn't
when
the
telegrapher
member
on
the
board
voted
with
a
railroad
to
deny
a
clerk's
claim;
that
night,
he
was
removed
from
the
board
in
emergency
session
–
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
railway
labor
executives
meeting
and
took
him
off
the
board.
for
a
number
of
years,
the
telegraphers
did
not
have
a
representative
on
the
board.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yeah,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
perfectly
valid
decision.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
am
fairly
familiar
with
the
board's
docket
and
i
would
say
that
the
third
division,
which
is
the
one
you
are
merely
concerned
with,
is
approximate
2
½
years
behind.
but
it
is
fast
catching
up.
responsible
people
on
our
side
of
the
table
indicate
that
within
a
year-and-a-half,
they
should
be
on
a
current
basis
of
say
6
months.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
four,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
thank
you
very
much.
