mr.

chief

thank
you.
mr.
wilcox?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
would
flow,
it
would
flow
naturally
from
decision
in
your
favor,
i
would
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
don't
--
we
are
not
dealing
with
how
you
do
business
but
how
you
could
do
business
under
an
opinion
that
this
court
writes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
the
penalty
be
if
you
did
that
under
section
2
that
you
just
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
here
you
have
got
that
situation,
except
for
the
matter
of
intent
that
i
put
in
--
you've
got
two
situations
where
these
people
claim,
at
least,
that
the
ambiguities
in
the
two
contacts
raise
an
issue
as
to
which
one
of
the
unions
is
entitled
to
the
work.
and
the
railroad
just
steps
aside
and
says,
“alright
now,
that's
no
problem
of
ours;
you
just
find
it
out
before
the
board
here
and
what
every
one
gets,
it's
alright
with
us”.
doesn't
that
be
tracked
from
a
collective
bargaining
--
the
integrity
of
bargaining?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
would
you
have
the
right
to
say,
“well,
we
don't
care.
it
isn't
essential
for
us
to
bargain
right
down
to
a
final
determination
of
rules
entitled
to
this.
the
board
would
take
care
of
that
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
it,
we
are
not
preferring
a
proceeding
before
the
board
and
the
board
will
let
it
go
to
the
--
let
the
two
unions
find
that
out
and
whichever
prevails
for
the
board,
it's
alright
with
us”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you've
got
the
situation
here
where
you
claim
you,
then
i
have
no
doubt
you
bargain
on
a
plea
and
here,
there
are
two
unions
that
you
say
ought
to
be
brought
before
the
board
to
have
it
determined
which
one
shall
have
a
work.
now,
that's
an
issue.
i
would
say
that's
an
issue
that
could
well
have
been
determined
at
the
bargaining
table.
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
you
obliged
in
your
bargaining
agreement
to
determine
what
work
an
individual
union
is
entitled
to
have
and
what
work
another
union
is
entitled
to
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
that
bargaining
agreements
would
and
probably
should
determine
the
extent
of
signal
work
and
the
intended
clerical
work,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilcox,
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you
this.
would
you
tell
me
specifically
how
many
members
would
be
on
the
board
if
you
prevailed
and
the
clerks
must
be
brought
in
and
how
these
people
are
selected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
who
will
approve
of
those
five
members,
that
carrier,
the
telegraphers
union
or
the
clerks
union
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
that
they
don't
operate,
suppose
they
can't
operate
together?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
railway
labor
executives
has
membership
of
whom?
just
the
brotherhood
or
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
non-operating
as
well?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
wouldn't
expect
one
of
them
to
say,
will
you
take
telegraphers
to
say,
“will
you
take
all
clerks,
that's
all
right.
we
don't
care”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wouldn't
happen
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
be
some
or
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
this
case
for
instance,
you
assigned
this
work
to
the
clerks.
isn't
it
entirely
natural
that
your
five
people
in
voting
for
the
railroad
would
join
with
those
who
were
friendly
to
the
clerks
and
therefore
you
would
win
in
every
situation?

warren
no.
