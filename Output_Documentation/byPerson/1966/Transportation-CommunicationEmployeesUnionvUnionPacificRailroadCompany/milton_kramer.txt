mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
court.
in
1951
or
there
about,
the
union
pacific
railroad
installed
a
battery
of
new
machines
in
its
yard
at
las
vegas.
these
were
11
machines
of
7
types.
this
battery
of
machines
performed
work
that
prior
thereto
was
performed
in
part
by
telegraphers
represented
by
the
transportation
communications
union
and
in
part
by
the
clerks
but
it
assigned
all
this
works
to
clerks.
although
we
performed
work,
the
midi
fact
was
work
formally
by
telegraphers
in
part.
the
tcu
(transportations
communications
union)
filed
a
claim
with
the
railroad
claiming
that
assigning
this
work
or
even
committing
it
to
be
performed
by
a
craft
other
than
the
telegraphers
was
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
claim
was
in
the
words
of
every
labor
act
handled
in
the
usual
manner
and
without
agreement.
it
was
then
submitted
to
the
national
bureau
of
adjustment,
the
very
division.
we
asked
the
board
to
hold
that
having
the
communications
aspect
of
the
work
performed
by
employees
other
than
telegraphers
was
a
violation
of
the
agreements
and
that
the
remedy
should
be
that
each
time
it
happened,
the
senior
idle
telegrapher,
at
the
time
it
happened,
be
paid
a
day's
pay.
the
third
division
gave
notice
of
its
proceeding
to
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
which
represented
the
clerks
and
offered
them
an
opportunity
to
participate,
to
be
heard
that
they
care
to.
the
clerks
replied
stating
that
they
understood
the
dispute
was
over
the
interpretation
of
the
telegrapher's
agreements
that
is
whether
the
telegraphers’
agreement
covered
part
of
this
work
and
our
understanding
is
incorrect
said
the
clerks.
we
did
not
get
a
response.
the
clerks’
response
continued
that
“if
my
understanding
with
this
dispute
is
correct,
we
are
not
involved
and
we
do
not
care
to
be
heard”.
they
added
that
the
rights
of
the
employees
represented
by
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
is
predicated
on
the
clerks’
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
not
on
any
other
and
that
if
at
any
time
or
for
any
reason,
the
carrier
should
assign
work
covered
by
the
clerks’
agreement
to
employees
not
covered
by
the
clerks’
agreement.
they
would
take
the
appropriate
steps
under
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
in
the
proceeding,
the
carrier
argued
to
the
board,
among
other
arguments
that
all
the
work
was
covered
by
the
clerks’
agreement
and
they
were
committed
to
make
that
argument.
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
in
error
in
one
statement
it
made.
it
says
that
evidence
of
the
clerks’
agreement
was
excluded
by
the
adjustment
board
rules
of
evidence.
now
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
record
to
support
that
and
in
fact,
it
is
not
so.
the
regulations
of
the
adjustment
board
commit
anybody
to
submit
anything
it
wants.
doors
are
wide
open.
about
the
award
of
the
adjustment
board
sustained
the
claim
of
tcu
(transportation
communication
employees
union)
used
to
be
named
order
of
railroad
telegraphers.
there's
been
a
change
in
name.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
that
the
carrier
argued
that
the
clerks’
agreement
covered
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
they
attached
a
copy.
all
these
arguments
were
in
writing
and
have
lots
of
exhibits
that
were
submitted
to
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
don't
know
if
they
did
it
in
this
case
or
not.
they
rarely
do
it.
they
rarely
have
oral
hearing.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
submit
to
justice
stewart
just
asked
me
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
don't
either.
it's
not
in
the
record.
but
a
member
the
adjustment
board
as
a
vice
president
of
the
clerks
union.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
no,
the
party,
presenting
the
dispute
gives
of
intention
to
file
the
following
claim
and
then
they
--
this
is
slightly
from
division
to
division.
then
in
30
days
whatever
period
it
is
submit
the
statement
of
facts,
position
of
the
spouses
who
disputed
the
facts.
well,
they
have
the
resolve
it
upon
the
basis
of
a
written
document.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
don't
have
any
witnesses.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
the
only
evidence
as
written
evidence
submitted
by
one
side
or
the
other.
now
they
sometimes
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
but
the
evidence
is
written
evidence.
now,
sometimes
a
case
is
remanded
to
the
railroad
for
the
development
of
the
traditional
negotiations,
let
say.
but
they
never
have
witnesses
and
quite
seldom
have
oral
argument.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
affidavits
in
the
sense
of
testimony.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
this
is
quite
formal.
in
the
ordinary
labor
arbitration
you
have
witnesses.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
here
they
have
–
they
follow
a
one
ritual
and
one
side
files
papers
and
the
other
side
files
a
response.
and
so
not
long
ago
we
could
keep
on
replying
to
each
other
to
eternity.
but
they've
cut
that
short.
mr.
milton
kramer
in
the
third
division,
they
used
to
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
i
think
we
can
respond
to
each
other
about
twice
or
three
times.
mr.
milton
kramer
almost.
no
somewhat
loose
in
that
because
common
lawyer
couldn't
file
a
pleading
unless
additional
facts
were
alleged
not
just
additional
arguments.
here,
they
can
reply
to
each
other's
arguments.
mr.
milton
kramer
you
would
think
so.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
now,
certainly,
the
carrier
was
not
precluded
from
submitting
the
clerk's
agreement.
it
can
submit
anything
it
wants
and
if
it
wasn't
in
the
record
it
was
only
because
the
carrier
did
not
see
fit
to
submit
it.
if
it
was
not
in
the
record,
they
certainly
could've
put
it
in
the
record.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
normally
do
not
have
an
oral
argument.(voice
overlap)
but
sometimes
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
it's
more
than
pleading,
the
pleading
that
these
papers
contain
an
argument.
they
are
both
statements
of
fact
and
briefs.
it's
written
argument
rather
than
oral
although
occasionally
there
maybe
an
oral
argument.
well,
the
adjustment
board
with
a
new
proceeding
as
a
member,
sustained
this
aspect
of
the
telegrapher's
claim
and
ordered
the
carrier
to
compensate
the
senior
idle
employee
each
time
it
happened.
and
the
union
pacific
refused
to
comply
and
it
refused
to
pay
the
senior
idle
employee
and
we
brought
an
action
to
enforce
the
award
under
section
3
(p)
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
district
court
held
that
the
clerks
were
an
indispensable
party
to
that
lawsuit,
to
enforce
this
award
which
said
that
the
telegrapher's
contract
had
been
violated,
and
dismissed
for
that
reason.
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
two
opinions.
the
first
opinion
it
reversed
the
holding
of
the
district
court
saying
that
the
clerks
were
not
indispensable
to
the
court
proceeding
but
that
they
were
indispensable
to
the
adjustment
board
proceeding
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
adjustment
board
which
would
require
the
clerks
to
participate.
but
then
later,
withdrew
that
opinion
and
affirmed
but
it
affirmed
not
on
the
ground
that
the
clerks
were
an
indispensable
party
to
the
court
proceeding
as
the
district
court
has
done.
but
that
the
award
was
invalid
because
the
clerks,
i'm
quoting,
“for
all
practical
purposes
became
party
to
the
administrative
proceedings.
now,
just
what
the
court
meant
by
that
i
don't
know.
it
is
unclear
what
the
board
should
do
but
i
presume
what
they
meant
was
that
the
adjustment
board
must
make
an
interpretation
of
post
agreements.
at
the
same
time,
whether
or
not
the
clerk's
participate,
they
did
say
that
the
board
should
make
a
complete
disposition
of
the
dispute
as
to
all
concerned
parties.
and
i
presumably
admit,
that
you
must
make
a
ruling
on
the
meaning
of
the
clerk's
agreement.
well,
the
first
one
remanded,
reversed
and
said
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
dismissed
the
case
but
should
have
remanded
it
to
the
board.
and
the
second
case,
it
said
the
award
was
invalid
and
therefore,
the
enforcement
suit
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
what
i
was
saying
was
that
the
board
should
have
made
an
interpretation
of
the
clerk's
agreement.
the
clerks
who
were
invited,
refused
to
participate.
mr.
milton
kramer
in
the
white
house
case,
white
house
against
illinois
central,
this
court
said,
now
perhaps
by
way
of
dictum,
in
a
similar
situation
where
the
clerks
were
not
in,
where
notice
had
not
been
given
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
enjoin
the
board
for
proceeding,
this
court
said
that
--
maybe
a
decision
would
be
made
that
doesn't
hurt
anybody,
it
doesn't
hurt
the
railroad.
in
any
event,
the
only
necessary
parties
are
before
the
board.
now,
the
clerks
were
not
there.
and
this
court
said
the
only
necessary
parties
are
before
the
board.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
they
did
object
initially
when
notice
was
not
given
to
the
clerks.
then
they
objected
to
proceeding
without
the
clerks
being
given
opportunity
to
appear
if
they
wanted
to.
notice
was
then
given.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
said:
“we
are
not
interested.
the
dispute,
as
we
understand
it,
has
always
a
meaning
of
the
telegrapher's
agreement
and
we're
not
interested”.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
believe
not.
mr.
milton
kramer
on
the
merits.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
district
court
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that
the
clerks
were
an
indispensable
party
to
enforce
and
award/
withheld
that
the
telegrapher's
agreement
covered
the
work.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
agree.
mr.
milton
kramer
most
of
the
argument,
your
honors,
is
on
the
record
beginning
on
page
5
through
71
is
reported,
just
about
all
that
was
submitted
to
the
board
in
writing.
85
and
71
of
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
lays
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
two
unions.
there
is
no
dispute
here
between
two
unions.
the
only
dispute
involved
here
is,
did
the
telegrapher's
agreement
covered
the
work
and
that
the
carrier,
therefore,
violate
it
when
they
designed
it
to
other
than
telegraphers.
the
brc,
the
clerks
thought
that
they
weren't
involved
in
that
dispute.
they
thought
that
they
had
any
right
just
predicated
on
their
contract
which
has
not
been
violated.
but
if
you
assume
that
there
is
a
dispute
here
between
two
union,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
adjustment
board
doesn't
have
a
jurisdiction
to
resolve
disputes
between
unions.
its
jurisdiction
is
provided
in
section
31
of
the
act.
it
is
dispute
“dispute
between
and
employee
or
group
of
employees
and
a
carrier
or
carriers”.
now,
if
there
is
dispute
between
unions,
it
doesn't
come
into
that
category
and
the
adjustment
board
couldn't
decide
it.
but
in
any
event
there
is
no
dispute
here
between
the
unions.
clerks
are
not
disputing
the
meaning
of
telegrapher's
agreement
and
vice
versa.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
it
was
so
determined,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
between
the
unions
there
is
no
dispute.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
and
it's
all
contracted,
or
were
to
see
to
change
the
agreement
but
which
they
did
not
try
do.
this
award
came
out
five
years
ago
and
they
still
haven't
tried
to
change
the
agreement.
they
could
serve
a
section
6
notice
and
go
through
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
if
they
weren't
successful
in
persuading
one
union
or
the
other
to
change
the
agreement,
it
could
then
unilaterally
change
the
rule.
but
it
has
not
even
tried
to
do
that.
also
the
adjustment
board
could
not,
in
this
proceeding,
issue
a
final
and
binding
interpretation
of
the
clerks
agreement
because
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
carrier
and
the
clerks
over
that
meaning
of
that
agreement.
the
dispute
must
be
between
the
carrier
and
the
union
and
they
have
no
dispute
over
the
clerk's
agreement
and
unless
there
is
a
dispute,
the
adjustment
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
render
an
interpretation
of
it.
and
secondly,
even
if
there
were
such
a
dispute,
before
the
adjustment
board
can
exercise
jurisdiction,
the
railway
labor
act
required
that
the
dispute
be
handled
in
the
usual
manner
up
to
and
including
the
chief
operating
officer
of
the
carrier
designated
to
handle
such
disputes.
until
that's
done,
the
adjustment
board
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
that
hasn't
been
done
with
respect
to
the
clerks
agreement.
in
fact,
the
national
railway
adjustment
board
regulations
in
conformity
with
that
provision,
said
that
it
will
not
entertain
a
petition,
will
not
consider
a
petition
unless
the
subject
of
it
was
handled
in
the
usual
manner
on
the
property
up
to
and
including
and
so
forth.
so
they
couldn't
issue
a
final
and
binding
interpretation
of
the
clerks
agreement
within
their
jurisdiction
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there
was
no
dispute
so
they
had
no
jurisdiction
and
it
was
not
handled
and
so
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
very
easy,
they
--
well,
if
the
railroad
agrees
with
them,
they
would
let
them
go
on
doing
the
work,
pay
twice
but
they
could
seek
to
plea
--
pardon?
well,
they
could
seek
to
change
one
of
the
agreements.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
the
work
is
taken
away
from
them
and
they
claim
to
work.
you
have
two
proceedings.
i
wouldn't
say
it's
quite
complicated.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
the
adjustment
board
holds
and
it
contracted
to
give
the
same
work
to
two
different
crafts,
yes.
and,
but
if
the
adjustment
board
holds
that
and
the
adjustment
rulings
are
not
reviewable
on
the
merits,
then
it
must
seek
to
change
one
of
the
agreements.
and
under
the
railway
labor
act,
you
can
change
it
unilaterally
after
you
follow
certain
procedures.
but
it
hasn't
made
any
effort
to
do
that.
what
it
really
should
have
done
is
before
installing
these
machines,
was
to
negotiate.
but
it
didn't
try.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
distinctly
not
the
board's
function,
that
board
has
no
authority
to
change
agreements.
its
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
or
application.
and
that's
perfectly
clear
from
the
statute.
believe
it,
if
it
weren't
perfectly
clear
from
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
the
draftsman
and
the
chief
proponent
told
congress
that
they
would
definitely
have
no
authority
to
cleanse
the
rules.
all
they
could
do
would
be
to
interpret/agree
on
rules.
and
the
adjustment
board
just
can't
synchronize
or
accommodate
one
to
the
other
or
what
have
you.
it
could
only
interpret
and
nothing
else.
also,
the
carrier
says
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
protected,
if
they
could
comply
with
the
award.
of
course
here
if
they
comply,
it's
only
paying
money
but
sometimes
they
are
ordered
to
get
someone
to
work.
and
they
are
entitled
to
be
protected.
where
will
they
get
that
right,
if
they
contract
with
more
than
one
organization
for
the
same
work?
why
shouldn't
they
be
liable
to
both?
and
if
the
adjustment
board
can
relieve
them
of
their
liability
under
one,
which
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do,
it
would
simply
destroy
collective
bargaining
on
the
subject
and
the
scope
of
the
agreement.
every
union,
i
came
to
--
asked
that
certain
work
be
included
in
this
contract,
would
give
an
affirmative
answer.
(inaudible)
put
it
in
new
agreement
and
(inaudible)
new
agreement,
anybody
who
wants
it.
and
then
when
one
of
them
says
you
violated
my
agreement,
we
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
the
adjustment
board
awards
it
to
one
and
they're
home
free
with
the
others.
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
railroad
labor
act
that
does
that?
the
adjustment
board
can't
set
aside
agreements,
can't
change
them.
they
simply
destroys
collective
bargaining
if
they
could
do
that.
now,
under
the
national
labor
relation
act
--
mr.
milton
kramer
on
this
subject?
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
no,
it
would
not.
but
if
it
in
fact
--
that
might
have
been
its
intents
but
if
in
fact,
it
contracted
with
another
one,
all
they
say
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
railway
labor
act
has
no
interest
on
how
many
people,
are
employed
for
any
number
of
jobs,
it's
sole
interest
is
to
try
to
avoid
strikes.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
an
arbitration
proceeding.
this
court
has
held.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
that's
all
it
can
do.
it
cannot
change
it.
the
only
way
you
can
change
contracts
by
arbitration
of
railroad
evidence
is
displayed
by
an
agreed
arbitration
would
be
one
exception
the
congress
enacted
three
years
ago.
but
if
the
carrier's
contention
is
right
that
they
could
be
relieved
of
liability
on
their
other
agreements,
if
it's
found
out
that
one
covers
it,
i
said
they
can
deliberately
contract
with
anybody
who
wants
it.
and
then
have
the
adjustment
board
bail
them
out,
the
act
wasn't
designed
for
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
think
that
is
probably
not
so
in
the
railroad
industry,
we
do
have
jurisdictional
dispute.
but
we
don't
have
any
strike
here.
there's
no
strike
or
federal
strike.
mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
justice
black,
there
were
three
cases
in
320
u.s.
which
repeatedly
said
that,
“congress
provided
that
administrative
remedy
for
certain
disputes.
judicial
remedy
could
be
availed
of
in
certain
situations
and
in
many
areas
left
it
entirely
to
negotiation,
mediation,
conciliation
and
there
was
to
be
no
administrative
or
judicial
remedy
in
large
areas
of
disputes
in
the
railroad
industry.
this
court
has
said
it
several
times
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
kramer
how
can
it
be
settled,
by
negotiation
or
mediation?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
they
have
to
negotiate.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
union
has
to
negotiate
with
the
employer.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
suppose
one
way
to
be
done
would
be
for
the
railroads
to
decide
which
union
it
ought
to
have
it
and
so
the
other
union,
with
a
notice
to
change
its
agreement.
and
then
when
you
have
the
negotiations
and
you
have
your
mediation
and
possibly
other
procedures
under
the
railway
labor
act,
including
a
proper
arbitration
and
to
be
detected
and
the
carrier
can
make
the
change
in
a
lot
of
ways,
once
it's
going
through
those
procedures.
and
the
tcu
agreement
would
thereby
be
changed
--
when
that
provision
would
be
out.
now,
whether
they
would
strike
over,
i
don't
know
but
not
likely.
it's
only
a
handful
of
jobs
involved.
they
might.
but
at
that
time,
some
years
hence,
we
would
first
have
the
possibility
of
strike.
but
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
way.
strikes
do
not
eventuate
over
things
like
this.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
of
course,
they
do.
i
don't
know
of
any
strike
in
the
railroad
industry
over
jurisdictional
dispute.
well,
there
may
have
been
a
few
one
or
two
day
strikes
perhaps.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
we
came
around
to
that.
for
a
long
time,
we
disputed
and
when
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
won
on
a
different
ground,
not
on
that
ground.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
at
that
time.
but
this
court
denies
certiorari
in
an
earlier
case
in
which
the
union
won.
and
then
the
case
after
white
house,
it
denied
certiorari
when
they
lost
over
that
issue.
so
we
then
gave
up
and
the
lower
courts
were
holding
against
this
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
could
come
in
and
say
anything
they
want.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
you
don't
what?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
didn't
get
the
implication.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
adjustment
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
were
invited
in
to
make
any
presentation
they
want.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
they
can't
ask
them
to
interpret
their
contract
because
it
has
not
been
negotiated/handled
in
the
usual
manner
on
the
property.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
could
come
in
and
argue
that
they
know
that
the
board
would
be
reluctant
to
find
that
same
works
in
more
than
one
agreement.
they
might
come
in
and
argue
that
telegraphers'
agreement
doesn't
cover
it
or
they
might
argue
that
this
performs
work
that
is
not
really
communications
work.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
no.
they
say
the
telegraphers
doesn't
because
it
doesn't.
because
the
work
superseded
was
not
communications
work
and
--
mr.
milton
kramer
tremendous.
well,
it
depends
on
the
division.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
but
it's
not
to
remain
that
way
because
congress
amended
the
law
and
we
can
get
a
special
board
anytime
we
want
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
three
of
the
divisions
have
each
five
members
appointed
by
the
railroad
and
five
by
the
unions
and
if
they
deadlock,
they
are
permanent
members.
now,
if
they
deadlock,
as
they
usually
do,
the
mediation
board
appoints
a
neutral
to
sit
as
a
member
of
the
board.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
that
would
give
the
carrier
to
--
right
every
case
its
way.
they
would
win
every
case
without
these
at
least
six
votes.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
it
would
get
the
vote
of
one
union.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
but
the
carrier
would
decide
every
case
as
they
wanted
it.
the
union
would
never
win
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
only
reason
we
gave
is
to
give
notice
to
anybody
involved.
mr.
milton
kramer
to
come
in
and
then
make
such
presentation
as
they
care
to
make.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
can't
get
a
binding
interpretation
of
their
agreement
when
nobody
is
disputing
what
their
agreement
means
and
they
have
not
negotiated
such
a
non-existent
dispute
on
the
railroad.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
we
don't
say
they
doesn't
--
mr.
milton
kramer
sure.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
would
you
say
that
the
clerks
would
be
bound
by
the
adjustment
board
decision,
it
would
be
bound
by
the
only
decision
the
adjustment
board
would
have
jurisdiction
to
make
–-
that
is
whether
or
not
the
telegraphers'
agreement
covers
it.
if
they
hold
the
telegrapher's
agreement
does
cover
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
any
way
they
want.
your
honor,
what
the
carrier
wants
to
do
is
to
write
into
the
railway
labor
act;
section
10(k)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
1947,
congress
added
section
10(k)
which
holds
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
decide
which
union
will
do
the
work.
but
even
then,
it
has
jurisdiction
only
when
there
is
a
strike
over
it.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
bring
that
division
into
the
railway
labor
act
and
expand
it.
and
say
the
adjustment
board
--
mr.
milton
kramer
clerks.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right
until
they
changed
our
agreement.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right
until
they
changed
the
agreement.
that's
the
award
of
the
board
and
that
award
is
final
and
binding.
certainly,
on
the
merit,
it's
final
and
binding.
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
we've
been
running
at
this
way
for
some
60
years
and
this
has
never
caused
havoc
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
court.
in
1951
or
there
about,
the
union
pacific
railroad
installed
a
battery
of
new
machines
in
its
yard
at
las
vegas.
these
were
11
machines
of
7
types.
this
battery
of
machines
performed
work
that
prior
thereto
was
performed
in
part
by
telegraphers
represented
by
the
transportation
communications
union
and
in
part
by
the
clerks
but
it
assigned
all
this
works
to
clerks.
although
we
performed
work,
the
midi
fact
was
work
formally
by
telegraphers
in
part.
the
tcu
(transportations
communications
union)
filed
a
claim
with
the
railroad
claiming
that
assigning
this
work
or
even
committing
it
to
be
performed
by
a
craft
other
than
the
telegraphers
was
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
claim
was
in
the
words
of
every
labor
act
handled
in
the
usual
manner
and
without
agreement.
it
was
then
submitted
to
the
national
bureau
of
adjustment,
the
very
division.
we
asked
the
board
to
hold
that
having
the
communications
aspect
of
the
work
performed
by
employees
other
than
telegraphers
was
a
violation
of
the
agreements
and
that
the
remedy
should
be
that
each
time
it
happened,
the
senior
idle
telegrapher,
at
the
time
it
happened,
be
paid
a
day's
pay.
the
third
division
gave
notice
of
its
proceeding
to
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
which
represented
the
clerks
and
offered
them
an
opportunity
to
participate,
to
be
heard
that
they
care
to.
the
clerks
replied
stating
that
they
understood
the
dispute
was
over
the
interpretation
of
the
telegrapher's
agreements
that
is
whether
the
telegraphers’
agreement
covered
part
of
this
work
and
our
understanding
is
incorrect
said
the
clerks.
we
did
not
get
a
response.
the
clerks’
response
continued
that
“if
my
understanding
with
this
dispute
is
correct,
we
are
not
involved
and
we
do
not
care
to
be
heard”.
they
added
that
the
rights
of
the
employees
represented
by
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
is
predicated
on
the
clerks’
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
not
on
any
other
and
that
if
at
any
time
or
for
any
reason,
the
carrier
should
assign
work
covered
by
the
clerks’
agreement
to
employees
not
covered
by
the
clerks’
agreement.
they
would
take
the
appropriate
steps
under
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
in
the
proceeding,
the
carrier
argued
to
the
board,
among
other
arguments
that
all
the
work
was
covered
by
the
clerks’
agreement
and
they
were
committed
to
make
that
argument.
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
in
error
in
one
statement
it
made.
it
says
that
evidence
of
the
clerks’
agreement
was
excluded
by
the
adjustment
board
rules
of
evidence.
now
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
record
to
support
that
and
in
fact,
it
is
not
so.
the
regulations
of
the
adjustment
board
commit
anybody
to
submit
anything
it
wants.
doors
are
wide
open.
about
the
award
of
the
adjustment
board
sustained
the
claim
of
tcu
(transportation
communication
employees
union)
used
to
be
named
order
of
railroad
telegraphers.
there's
been
a
change
in
name.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
that
the
carrier
argued
that
the
clerks’
agreement
covered
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
they
attached
a
copy.
all
these
arguments
were
in
writing
and
have
lots
of
exhibits
that
were
submitted
to
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
don't
know
if
they
did
it
in
this
case
or
not.
they
rarely
do
it.
they
rarely
have
oral
hearing.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
submit
to
justice
stewart
just
asked
me
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
don't
either.
it's
not
in
the
record.
but
a
member
the
adjustment
board
as
a
vice
president
of
the
clerks
union.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
no,
the
party,
presenting
the
dispute
gives
of
intention
to
file
the
following
claim
and
then
they
--
this
is
slightly
from
division
to
division.
then
in
30
days
whatever
period
it
is
submit
the
statement
of
facts,
position
of
the
spouses
who
disputed
the
facts.
well,
they
have
the
resolve
it
upon
the
basis
of
a
written
document.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
don't
have
any
witnesses.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
the
only
evidence
as
written
evidence
submitted
by
one
side
or
the
other.
now
they
sometimes
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
but
the
evidence
is
written
evidence.
now,
sometimes
a
case
is
remanded
to
the
railroad
for
the
development
of
the
traditional
negotiations,
let
say.
but
they
never
have
witnesses
and
quite
seldom
have
oral
argument.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
affidavits
in
the
sense
of
testimony.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
this
is
quite
formal.
in
the
ordinary
labor
arbitration
you
have
witnesses.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
here
they
have
–
they
follow
a
one
ritual
and
one
side
files
papers
and
the
other
side
files
a
response.
and
so
not
long
ago
we
could
keep
on
replying
to
each
other
to
eternity.
but
they've
cut
that
short.
mr.
milton
kramer
in
the
third
division,
they
used
to
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
i
think
we
can
respond
to
each
other
about
twice
or
three
times.
mr.
milton
kramer
almost.
no
somewhat
loose
in
that
because
common
lawyer
couldn't
file
a
pleading
unless
additional
facts
were
alleged
not
just
additional
arguments.
here,
they
can
reply
to
each
other's
arguments.
mr.
milton
kramer
you
would
think
so.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
now,
certainly,
the
carrier
was
not
precluded
from
submitting
the
clerk's
agreement.
it
can
submit
anything
it
wants
and
if
it
wasn't
in
the
record
it
was
only
because
the
carrier
did
not
see
fit
to
submit
it.
if
it
was
not
in
the
record,
they
certainly
could've
put
it
in
the
record.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
normally
do
not
have
an
oral
argument.(voice
overlap)
but
sometimes
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
it's
more
than
pleading,
the
pleading
that
these
papers
contain
an
argument.
they
are
both
statements
of
fact
and
briefs.
it's
written
argument
rather
than
oral
although
occasionally
there
maybe
an
oral
argument.
well,
the
adjustment
board
with
a
new
proceeding
as
a
member,
sustained
this
aspect
of
the
telegrapher's
claim
and
ordered
the
carrier
to
compensate
the
senior
idle
employee
each
time
it
happened.
and
the
union
pacific
refused
to
comply
and
it
refused
to
pay
the
senior
idle
employee
and
we
brought
an
action
to
enforce
the
award
under
section
3
(p)
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
district
court
held
that
the
clerks
were
an
indispensable
party
to
that
lawsuit,
to
enforce
this
award
which
said
that
the
telegrapher's
contract
had
been
violated,
and
dismissed
for
that
reason.
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
two
opinions.
the
first
opinion
it
reversed
the
holding
of
the
district
court
saying
that
the
clerks
were
not
indispensable
to
the
court
proceeding
but
that
they
were
indispensable
to
the
adjustment
board
proceeding
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
adjustment
board
which
would
require
the
clerks
to
participate.
but
then
later,
withdrew
that
opinion
and
affirmed
but
it
affirmed
not
on
the
ground
that
the
clerks
were
an
indispensable
party
to
the
court
proceeding
as
the
district
court
has
done.
but
that
the
award
was
invalid
because
the
clerks,
i'm
quoting,
“for
all
practical
purposes
became
party
to
the
administrative
proceedings.
now,
just
what
the
court
meant
by
that
i
don't
know.
it
is
unclear
what
the
board
should
do
but
i
presume
what
they
meant
was
that
the
adjustment
board
must
make
an
interpretation
of
post
agreements.
at
the
same
time,
whether
or
not
the
clerk's
participate,
they
did
say
that
the
board
should
make
a
complete
disposition
of
the
dispute
as
to
all
concerned
parties.
and
i
presumably
admit,
that
you
must
make
a
ruling
on
the
meaning
of
the
clerk's
agreement.
well,
the
first
one
remanded,
reversed
and
said
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
dismissed
the
case
but
should
have
remanded
it
to
the
board.
and
the
second
case,
it
said
the
award
was
invalid
and
therefore,
the
enforcement
suit
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
what
i
was
saying
was
that
the
board
should
have
made
an
interpretation
of
the
clerk's
agreement.
the
clerks
who
were
invited,
refused
to
participate.
mr.
milton
kramer
in
the
white
house
case,
white
house
against
illinois
central,
this
court
said,
now
perhaps
by
way
of
dictum,
in
a
similar
situation
where
the
clerks
were
not
in,
where
notice
had
not
been
given
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
enjoin
the
board
for
proceeding,
this
court
said
that
--
maybe
a
decision
would
be
made
that
doesn't
hurt
anybody,
it
doesn't
hurt
the
railroad.
in
any
event,
the
only
necessary
parties
are
before
the
board.
now,
the
clerks
were
not
there.
and
this
court
said
the
only
necessary
parties
are
before
the
board.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
they
did
object
initially
when
notice
was
not
given
to
the
clerks.
then
they
objected
to
proceeding
without
the
clerks
being
given
opportunity
to
appear
if
they
wanted
to.
notice
was
then
given.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
said:
“we
are
not
interested.
the
dispute,
as
we
understand
it,
has
always
a
meaning
of
the
telegrapher's
agreement
and
we're
not
interested”.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
believe
not.
mr.
milton
kramer
on
the
merits.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
district
court
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that
the
clerks
were
an
indispensable
party
to
enforce
and
award/
withheld
that
the
telegrapher's
agreement
covered
the
work.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
agree.
mr.
milton
kramer
most
of
the
argument,
your
honors,
is
on
the
record
beginning
on
page
5
through
71
is
reported,
just
about
all
that
was
submitted
to
the
board
in
writing.
85
and
71
of
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
lays
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
two
unions.
there
is
no
dispute
here
between
two
unions.
the
only
dispute
involved
here
is,
did
the
telegrapher's
agreement
covered
the
work
and
that
the
carrier,
therefore,
violate
it
when
they
designed
it
to
other
than
telegraphers.
the
brc,
the
clerks
thought
that
they
weren't
involved
in
that
dispute.
they
thought
that
they
had
any
right
just
predicated
on
their
contract
which
has
not
been
violated.
but
if
you
assume
that
there
is
a
dispute
here
between
two
union,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
adjustment
board
doesn't
have
a
jurisdiction
to
resolve
disputes
between
unions.
its
jurisdiction
is
provided
in
section
31
of
the
act.
it
is
dispute
“dispute
between
and
employee
or
group
of
employees
and
a
carrier
or
carriers”.
now,
if
there
is
dispute
between
unions,
it
doesn't
come
into
that
category
and
the
adjustment
board
couldn't
decide
it.
but
in
any
event
there
is
no
dispute
here
between
the
unions.
clerks
are
not
disputing
the
meaning
of
telegrapher's
agreement
and
vice
versa.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
it
was
so
determined,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
between
the
unions
there
is
no
dispute.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
and
it's
all
contracted,
or
were
to
see
to
change
the
agreement
but
which
they
did
not
try
do.
this
award
came
out
five
years
ago
and
they
still
haven't
tried
to
change
the
agreement.
they
could
serve
a
section
6
notice
and
go
through
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
if
they
weren't
successful
in
persuading
one
union
or
the
other
to
change
the
agreement,
it
could
then
unilaterally
change
the
rule.
but
it
has
not
even
tried
to
do
that.
also
the
adjustment
board
could
not,
in
this
proceeding,
issue
a
final
and
binding
interpretation
of
the
clerks
agreement
because
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
carrier
and
the
clerks
over
that
meaning
of
that
agreement.
the
dispute
must
be
between
the
carrier
and
the
union
and
they
have
no
dispute
over
the
clerk's
agreement
and
unless
there
is
a
dispute,
the
adjustment
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
render
an
interpretation
of
it.
and
secondly,
even
if
there
were
such
a
dispute,
before
the
adjustment
board
can
exercise
jurisdiction,
the
railway
labor
act
required
that
the
dispute
be
handled
in
the
usual
manner
up
to
and
including
the
chief
operating
officer
of
the
carrier
designated
to
handle
such
disputes.
until
that's
done,
the
adjustment
board
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
that
hasn't
been
done
with
respect
to
the
clerks
agreement.
in
fact,
the
national
railway
adjustment
board
regulations
in
conformity
with
that
provision,
said
that
it
will
not
entertain
a
petition,
will
not
consider
a
petition
unless
the
subject
of
it
was
handled
in
the
usual
manner
on
the
property
up
to
and
including
and
so
forth.
so
they
couldn't
issue
a
final
and
binding
interpretation
of
the
clerks
agreement
within
their
jurisdiction
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there
was
no
dispute
so
they
had
no
jurisdiction
and
it
was
not
handled
and
so
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
very
easy,
they
--
well,
if
the
railroad
agrees
with
them,
they
would
let
them
go
on
doing
the
work,
pay
twice
but
they
could
seek
to
plea
--
pardon?
well,
they
could
seek
to
change
one
of
the
agreements.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
the
work
is
taken
away
from
them
and
they
claim
to
work.
you
have
two
proceedings.
i
wouldn't
say
it's
quite
complicated.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
the
adjustment
board
holds
and
it
contracted
to
give
the
same
work
to
two
different
crafts,
yes.
and,
but
if
the
adjustment
board
holds
that
and
the
adjustment
rulings
are
not
reviewable
on
the
merits,
then
it
must
seek
to
change
one
of
the
agreements.
and
under
the
railway
labor
act,
you
can
change
it
unilaterally
after
you
follow
certain
procedures.
but
it
hasn't
made
any
effort
to
do
that.
what
it
really
should
have
done
is
before
installing
these
machines,
was
to
negotiate.
but
it
didn't
try.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
distinctly
not
the
board's
function,
that
board
has
no
authority
to
change
agreements.
its
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
or
application.
and
that's
perfectly
clear
from
the
statute.
believe
it,
if
it
weren't
perfectly
clear
from
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
the
draftsman
and
the
chief
proponent
told
congress
that
they
would
definitely
have
no
authority
to
cleanse
the
rules.
all
they
could
do
would
be
to
interpret/agree
on
rules.
and
the
adjustment
board
just
can't
synchronize
or
accommodate
one
to
the
other
or
what
have
you.
it
could
only
interpret
and
nothing
else.
also,
the
carrier
says
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
protected,
if
they
could
comply
with
the
award.
of
course
here
if
they
comply,
it's
only
paying
money
but
sometimes
they
are
ordered
to
get
someone
to
work.
and
they
are
entitled
to
be
protected.
where
will
they
get
that
right,
if
they
contract
with
more
than
one
organization
for
the
same
work?
why
shouldn't
they
be
liable
to
both?
and
if
the
adjustment
board
can
relieve
them
of
their
liability
under
one,
which
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do,
it
would
simply
destroy
collective
bargaining
on
the
subject
and
the
scope
of
the
agreement.
every
union,
i
came
to
--
asked
that
certain
work
be
included
in
this
contract,
would
give
an
affirmative
answer.
(inaudible)
put
it
in
new
agreement
and
(inaudible)
new
agreement,
anybody
who
wants
it.
and
then
when
one
of
them
says
you
violated
my
agreement,
we
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
the
adjustment
board
awards
it
to
one
and
they're
home
free
with
the
others.
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
railroad
labor
act
that
does
that?
the
adjustment
board
can't
set
aside
agreements,
can't
change
them.
they
simply
destroys
collective
bargaining
if
they
could
do
that.
now,
under
the
national
labor
relation
act
--
mr.
milton
kramer
on
this
subject?
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
no,
it
would
not.
but
if
it
in
fact
--
that
might
have
been
its
intents
but
if
in
fact,
it
contracted
with
another
one,
all
they
say
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
railway
labor
act
has
no
interest
on
how
many
people,
are
employed
for
any
number
of
jobs,
it's
sole
interest
is
to
try
to
avoid
strikes.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
an
arbitration
proceeding.
this
court
has
held.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
that's
all
it
can
do.
it
cannot
change
it.
the
only
way
you
can
change
contracts
by
arbitration
of
railroad
evidence
is
displayed
by
an
agreed
arbitration
would
be
one
exception
the
congress
enacted
three
years
ago.
but
if
the
carrier's
contention
is
right
that
they
could
be
relieved
of
liability
on
their
other
agreements,
if
it's
found
out
that
one
covers
it,
i
said
they
can
deliberately
contract
with
anybody
who
wants
it.
and
then
have
the
adjustment
board
bail
them
out,
the
act
wasn't
designed
for
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
think
that
is
probably
not
so
in
the
railroad
industry,
we
do
have
jurisdictional
dispute.
but
we
don't
have
any
strike
here.
there's
no
strike
or
federal
strike.
mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
justice
black,
there
were
three
cases
in
320
u.s.
which
repeatedly
said
that,
“congress
provided
that
administrative
remedy
for
certain
disputes.
judicial
remedy
could
be
availed
of
in
certain
situations
and
in
many
areas
left
it
entirely
to
negotiation,
mediation,
conciliation
and
there
was
to
be
no
administrative
or
judicial
remedy
in
large
areas
of
disputes
in
the
railroad
industry.
this
court
has
said
it
several
times
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
kramer
how
can
it
be
settled,
by
negotiation
or
mediation?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
they
have
to
negotiate.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
union
has
to
negotiate
with
the
employer.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
suppose
one
way
to
be
done
would
be
for
the
railroads
to
decide
which
union
it
ought
to
have
it
and
so
the
other
union,
with
a
notice
to
change
its
agreement.
and
then
when
you
have
the
negotiations
and
you
have
your
mediation
and
possibly
other
procedures
under
the
railway
labor
act,
including
a
proper
arbitration
and
to
be
detected
and
the
carrier
can
make
the
change
in
a
lot
of
ways,
once
it's
going
through
those
procedures.
and
the
tcu
agreement
would
thereby
be
changed
--
when
that
provision
would
be
out.
now,
whether
they
would
strike
over,
i
don't
know
but
not
likely.
it's
only
a
handful
of
jobs
involved.
they
might.
but
at
that
time,
some
years
hence,
we
would
first
have
the
possibility
of
strike.
but
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
way.
strikes
do
not
eventuate
over
things
like
this.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
of
course,
they
do.
i
don't
know
of
any
strike
in
the
railroad
industry
over
jurisdictional
dispute.
well,
there
may
have
been
a
few
one
or
two
day
strikes
perhaps.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
we
came
around
to
that.
for
a
long
time,
we
disputed
and
when
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
won
on
a
different
ground,
not
on
that
ground.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
at
that
time.
but
this
court
denies
certiorari
in
an
earlier
case
in
which
the
union
won.
and
then
the
case
after
white
house,
it
denied
certiorari
when
they
lost
over
that
issue.
so
we
then
gave
up
and
the
lower
courts
were
holding
against
this
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
could
come
in
and
say
anything
they
want.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
you
don't
what?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
didn't
get
the
implication.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
adjustment
board
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
were
invited
in
to
make
any
presentation
they
want.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
they
can't
ask
them
to
interpret
their
contract
because
it
has
not
been
negotiated/handled
in
the
usual
manner
on
the
property.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
could
come
in
and
argue
that
they
know
that
the
board
would
be
reluctant
to
find
that
same
works
in
more
than
one
agreement.
they
might
come
in
and
argue
that
telegraphers'
agreement
doesn't
cover
it
or
they
might
argue
that
this
performs
work
that
is
not
really
communications
work.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
no.
they
say
the
telegraphers
doesn't
because
it
doesn't.
because
the
work
superseded
was
not
communications
work
and
--
mr.
milton
kramer
tremendous.
well,
it
depends
on
the
division.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
but
it's
not
to
remain
that
way
because
congress
amended
the
law
and
we
can
get
a
special
board
anytime
we
want
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
three
of
the
divisions
have
each
five
members
appointed
by
the
railroad
and
five
by
the
unions
and
if
they
deadlock,
they
are
permanent
members.
now,
if
they
deadlock,
as
they
usually
do,
the
mediation
board
appoints
a
neutral
to
sit
as
a
member
of
the
board.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
that
would
give
the
carrier
to
--
right
every
case
its
way.
they
would
win
every
case
without
these
at
least
six
votes.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
it
would
get
the
vote
of
one
union.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
but
the
carrier
would
decide
every
case
as
they
wanted
it.
the
union
would
never
win
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
only
reason
we
gave
is
to
give
notice
to
anybody
involved.
mr.
milton
kramer
to
come
in
and
then
make
such
presentation
as
they
care
to
make.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
can't
get
a
binding
interpretation
of
their
agreement
when
nobody
is
disputing
what
their
agreement
means
and
they
have
not
negotiated
such
a
non-existent
dispute
on
the
railroad.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
we
don't
say
they
doesn't
--
mr.
milton
kramer
sure.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
would
you
say
that
the
clerks
would
be
bound
by
the
adjustment
board
decision,
it
would
be
bound
by
the
only
decision
the
adjustment
board
would
have
jurisdiction
to
make
–-
that
is
whether
or
not
the
telegraphers'
agreement
covers
it.
if
they
hold
the
telegrapher's
agreement
does
cover
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
any
way
they
want.
your
honor,
what
the
carrier
wants
to
do
is
to
write
into
the
railway
labor
act;
section
10(k)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
1947,
congress
added
section
10(k)
which
holds
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
decide
which
union
will
do
the
work.
but
even
then,
it
has
jurisdiction
only
when
there
is
a
strike
over
it.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
