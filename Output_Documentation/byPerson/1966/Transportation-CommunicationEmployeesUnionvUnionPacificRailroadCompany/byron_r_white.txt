then
that
the
only
reason
that
the

your

that

force
the

what

the

is
whether
the

it

mr.

what
--
if
you

what
would
prevent
the
carrier
from
sitting
down
with
two
groups
rather
than
to
reason
that
out
at
the
bargaining
table
would
make
the
two
agreements
ambiguous
enough
so
that
it
might
be
interpreted
either
way
and
then,
when
there
was
a
disagreement
between
the

to
have
it
and
one
of
them
brought
a
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board

the

said,
“well,

now,
what
would
prevent
you
from
doing
that?

the

could
what?

no,

in

justice
byron

white
i
know
but
are
they
usually

justice
byron

white
why
they
don't
set
up
a

for
taking
as
a
dispute,
we
already
have
a

law?
justice
byron

white
well,
how
do
you
suggest
that
the
--
you
think
that
this
award
should
be

and
your
idea
is
that
both
unions
should
be
before
the
board.
how
does
the
board
get
them
to
court
when
the
clerks
say,
“sorry
we
have
notice
by
we
don't
want
to
come
in,
in
the
first
place
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
we
want
--
we
have
no
dispute
with
the

at
all”.
we're
doing
our
work,
he
is
paying
our
people.
and
if
we
did
have
one,
the
negotiations
should
have
to
start
on
the
profit,
like
the
act
said”.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
understand
you.
justice
byron

white
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
would
expect
the

board
to
make
this
decision
and
to
interpret
both
contracts.
justice
byron

white
and
then
if
the
clerks
wanted
to
stay
out
while
their
contracts
were
being
interpreted,
let
them
stay,
but
they
would
be
bound?
justice
byron

white
--
many
ways
as
you
said.
justice
byron

so
they
don't
have

they
can
be?
justice

--
often

that
