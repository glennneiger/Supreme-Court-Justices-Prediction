justice
potter
stewart
now
the
--
the
charging
parties
were
the
manufacturers
of
the
prefabricated
doors?
justice
potter
stewart
but
soon
as
far
as
the
charging
parties
go,
the
manufacturers
of
the
prefabricated
doors,
what
possible
difference
could
it
make
in
either
event
their
product
have
been
boycotted
in
the
philadelphia
area?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
you
keep
out
of
then.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
despite
that
at
the
moment
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
i
think
they
simply
know
if
they
made
any
difference
at
all
to
the
charging
parties
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
there
not,
mr.
frouge
was
--
had
control
or
didn't
have
control.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
it's
the
extent
of
the
impact
upon
the
charging
parties
was
the
same
both
in
the
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
three
other
contractors
and
mr.
frouge.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
if
you
told
us
upon
what
ground
the
board
held,
that
this
agree
--
that
--
that
rule
17
or
the
agreement
in
which
where
rule
17
is
incorporated
did
not
violate
8
(e)?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
the
board's
reasoning
from
the
beginning?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
we
go,
just
on
term
on
my
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
board
that
rely
on
the
final
proviso
of
8
(e)
in
other
words,
if
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
that
even
if
rule
will
not
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
that's
the
board's
position
from
the
beginning
and
continues
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
the
8
(e)
aspect.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
but
then,
the
proviso
of
8
(e)
might
again
accept
this
particular
provision
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
but
you're
saying
(voice
overlap)
it
read
literally
it
does
fall
within.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
just
telling
us.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
was
a
--
out
of
the
public
interest,
is
the
public?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
not
talking
about
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
you're
talking
about
the
--
about
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
aren't
you?
which
is
now
become
b
under
the
1979
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
now
when
you
tell
them
that
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
it
sounds
like
you're
talking
about
the
law
since
the
9
--
since
1959
and
you're
talking
about
the
law
prior
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
now
that
the
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
1947
law.
justice
potter
stewart
the
1947
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
product?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
union's
interest
was
a
--
presumably
was
for
its
membership
if
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
union's
primary
interest
wasn't
the
interest
of
the
employers.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
the
same
as
here
if
it
was
--
if
want
to
make
work
for
its
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
only
its
members.
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
philadelphia
--
for
the
philadelphia
contractors.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
keep
all
prefabricated
doors
out
of
the
philadelphia
area,
don't
they,
they
boycott
them?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
surely
but
there's
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
some
collective
bargaining
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
would
violate
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
but
whether
or
not
he
was
the
target
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
its
hard
to
say
he
wasn't,
he
was
hit
right
in
the
bulls
eye,
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
if
he
couldn't
sell
any
of
his
products
in
philadelphia.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
a
common-situs,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
situs,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
but
he
does.
he
condemn
that
view
but
he
doesn't
say
that's
the
only
view
he
condemns.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
was
a
stock
illustration.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
illustration.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
case
--
for
almost
exactly
like
the
one
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
when
i
was
--
the
general
mill
worker
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
doors.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
remember
it.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
the
basis
was
that
they
were
prefabricated
doors,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
reason
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
their
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
--
provided
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
agreement
provided
in
that
case?
didn't
have
--
it
didn't
say
doors
manufactured
by
some
other
union,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
would.
justice
potter
stewart
my
recollection
is
that
it's
a
fairly
--
getting
to
be
a
fairly
(inaudible)
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
was
the
same
kind
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
provision
we
have
there.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
one
--
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
the
--
if
the
neutral
employers
here
were
the
manufacturers
of
the
prefabricated
doors,
not
the
contractors
in
philadelphia.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
all
wrong
about
that,
am
i
--
then
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
--
well,
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
manufacturer
of
the
prefabricated
doors
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
his
employees
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
public
he
serves
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
were
being
hurt
and
they
are
neutral
people.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
primary
dispute.
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
the
neut
--
who
was
the
neutral
employer
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
--
the
charging
