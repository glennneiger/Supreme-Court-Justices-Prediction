mr.
charles
b.
mahin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
consists
of
companies
that
make
doors
and
millwork.
they
manufacture
prefabricated
doors
that
are
used
in
constructions
throughout
the
united
states
in
the
philadelphia
area.
this
case
involves
a
product
boycott
of
these
prefabricated
doors
in
philadelphia
by
the
philadelphia
carpenters
union,
and
this
went
on
throughout
its
five-county
jurisdictional
area.
now,
the
specific
questions
are,
in
number
110,
whether
the
union's
boycott
of
doors
on
a
so-called
frouge
job,
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
act,
that
labor
relations
act,
and
in
number
111,
whether
the
boycott
agreement
of
union
rule
17
violated
section
8
(e)
of
the
act.
but
your
honors
there's
a
broader
question
in
this
case,
a
question
of
principle.
and
that
is,
whether
unions
throughout
the
country
can
draw
boycott
curtains
about
their
respective
communities,
banning
there
from
factory-made
products
and
factory-finished
products
of
many
kinds.
because
if
the
philadelphia
union
can
draw
a
--
an
embargo
upon
prefabricated
doors
in
that
city,
the
electrical
workers
union
in
allen
bradley
may
resume
its
boycott
of
electrical
equipment
and
prefabricated
products
in
that
case.
the
glaziers'
union
in
the
chicago
joliet
contractors
case
can
resume
their
boycott
of
pre-glazed
factory-made
windows
and
over
in
cincinnati,
the
carpenters
union
can
resume
its
boycott
of
pre-hung
doors
as
in
general
millwork,
and
on
and
on.
and
that
is
the
reason
your
honors,
this
public
detriment,
this
adverse
effect
is
the
reasons
so
many
industries
throughout
the
country
are
before
the
court
here
today
as
amici
curiae
stressing
the
illegality
of
this
sort
of
union
boycotts.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
in
the
other
cases,
the
same
provision
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
the
cases
i
referred
to,
except
down
in
allen
bradley
which
i'll
refer
to
as
an
antitrust
case.
i'll
come
to
the
cases
specifically
too
your
honor.
now,
the
statutory
provisions
are
contained
in
our
brief
in
number
110
at
page
2
and
i
might
mention
that
our
brief
in
that
case
is
a
consol
--
has
a
consolidated
caption
of
110
and
111,
and
i
ask
that
you
disregard
the
number
111
on
that
white
document
and
strike
it
if
you
care
to.
now,
an
offense
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
embodies
two
elements,
union
inducement
of
employees
to
strike
or
coercion
of
an
employer
for
an
object
of
requiring
any
person
to
cease
handling
of
products
of
another
producer
or
manufacturer
or
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
the
other
statutory
provision
is
section
8
(e).
now,
this
was
enacted
in
1959
to
complement
and
close
a
loophole
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
now,
this
section
then
in
essence
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
union
and
an
employer
to
enter
into
any
agreement
that
the
employer
will
cease
handling
the
products
of
any
other
person
or
cease
doing
ba
--
business
with
any
other
person.
now,
the
8
(e)
provision
has
a
proviso
which
is
involved
here
and
that
is
that
there
is
exempted
from
8
(e),
agreements
in
the
construction
industry,
relating
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
if
the
court
please
is
to
state
brief
with
the
nature
of
the
case
then
go
to
the
110
case,
that's
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
then
the
111
case.
now,
the
facts
can
be
briefly
summarized
are
not
materially
in
dispute.
these
prefabricated
doors,
are
doors
which
are
sized,
cut,
pre-hung,
laminated,
treated
or
in
some
other
ways
substantially
fabricated
at
the
factory.
they
have
economic
and
aesthetic
advantages,
was
testified
and
they're
being
used
increasingly
in
construction
throughout
the
country.
the
core
of
the
union's
boycott
campaign
was
rule
17.
now,
the
key
part
of
this
rule
was,
and
it's
quoted
in
our
brief
110,
page
7,
beginning
at
the
second
sentence,
"no
member
of
this
district
counsel
will
handle
material
coming
from
a
mill
where
cutting
out
and
fitting
has
been
done."
and
going
on,
"nor
any
doors
or
transoms
which
have
been
fitted
prio
--
prior
to
being
finished
on
the
job."
now,
this
rule
17
by
its
terms
and
as
enforced
by
the
union,
barred
prefabricated
doors
from
philadelphia.
the
particular
difficulties
started
in
february
1963
when
the
philadelphia
union
manager
wrote
to
president
hutcheson
of
the
brotherhood
of
carpenters,
the
national
organization,
that
there
was
a
serious
problem
of
prefabricated
doors
flowing
into
philadelphia.
this
was
followed
by
the
campaign
to
bar
doors
and
that
resulted
in
the
four
cases
we
have
as
the
basis
of
this
case
today.
and
today,
there
are
boycotts
on
four
jobs,
hospital
jobs,
school
jobs
and
housing
job,
and
the
last
one
was
the
contractor
frouge
job
that
i
had
mentioned
earlier.
on
these
first
three
jobs,
the
prefab
doors
were
specified
by
the
owners.
on
the
frouge
job,
there
was
an
open
specification
on
frouge
that
he
used
these
doors
because
they
save
time
and
money.
but
the
essential
feature
of
the
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
the
union
conduct
on
all
four
jobs
was
exactly
the
same.
the
union
enforcing
rule
17,
refused
to
install
over
4000
jobs
--
doors,
made
by
manufacturers
in
wisconsin,
penns
--
pennsylvania
and
indiana
who
where
the
charging
parties
in
this
case.
now,
the
decisions
below,
on
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
were,
that
the
board
and
the
court
found,
that
the
union's
boycotts
on
these
first
three
jobs
were
illegal
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
because
the
real
targets
of
the
union
were
the
prefabricated
doors
and
those
who
manufactured
them
and
distributed
and
used
them.
the
court
likened
the
boycott
to
the
one
in
the
allen
bradley
case
and
the
joliet
contractors
case.
but
on
the
first
job,
the
board
held
there
was
no
violation
because
the
specifications
didn't
require
frouge
to
use
these
doors
and
under
the
board's
new
control
theory
which
is
the
issue
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
frouge
was
the
sole
objective
and
the
court
apparently
going
on
on
this
theory
agree.
with
reference
to
section
8
(e),
the
board
held
that
rule
17
was
only
a
work
preservation
rule,
non-violative
8
(e),
the
court
reversed
and
held
that
rule
17's
ban
on
the
prefabricated
doors
violated
8
(e).
now,
turning
first
to
the
110
case,
we
have
in
this
case
if
the
court
please,
a
typical
form
of
product
boycott,
which
is
consistently
been
held
illegal
for
20
years
except
for
these
recent
decisions
of
the
board
since
1947.
now,
this
marked
change
in
the
thinking
of
the
board,
as
revealed
by
the
fact
that
the
general
counsel
for
the
board
only
three
years
ago
in
accordance
with
his
then
understanding
of
the
law
filed
a
complaint
and
prosecuted
the
case
on
essentially
the
same
basis
that
we
are
contending
before
the
court
today.
now,
the
board
reversed
its
general
counsel
and
today
of
course
counsel
is
supporting
the
board's
current
position.
i'd
like
to
call
first
the
attention
at
our
brief
page
20
that
--
that
the
statutory
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
is
aimed
precisely
at
the
type
of
boycott
conduct
carried
on
by
the
union
under
rule
17.
the
language
is
plain,
contractor
frouge
as
a
person,
the
prefab
doors
which
he
was
forced
to
stop
using,
are
products
manufactured
by
other
producers.
now,
your
honors,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
nor
in
the
legal
history
that
provides
product
boycott
immunity
because
of
the
immediate
employer's
legal
freedom
to
comply
with
the
union's
boycott
demand,
nor
is
there
anything
which
relates
to
the
union's
desire
to
preserve
work.
on
the
contrary,
the
circumstances
which
led
directly
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
1947
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
to
outlaw
just
this
kind
of
a
boycott.
now,
as
i
reviewed
in
our
brief,
page
110
and
page
21,
a
prime
concern
of
congress,
and
this
is
a
very
important
point
i
think,
was
the
embargo
and
trade
restraint
aspects
of
product
boycotts.
although
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
a
labor
law
and
not
an
antitrust
law,
its
roots
are
grounded
in
antitrust
law.
now,
this
court
pointed
out
in
allen
bradley
applying
the
sherman
act
and
again
in
inter
--
international
rice
milling
in
applying
the
labor
act
that
this
court
over
the
years
has
been
concerned
with
two
congressional
objectives.
one,
which
seeks
to
preserve
a
business
--
competitive
business
economy
and
the
other
which
seeks
to
preserve
the
rights
of
labor
to
preserve
its
own
conditions.
but
your
honors,
the
problem
is
this,
that
in
its
recent
decisions,
the
board
has
come
to
disregard
this
first
congressional
objective
and
has
focused
almost
on
entirely
on
the
second
one,
namely
that
of
union
self-interest.
now
what
led
the
taft-hartley
in
the
beginning?
because
in
the
hutcheson
case,
by
this
court
and
others
--
other
cases
of
the
same
type,
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision,
1945
in
allen
bradley,
union
self-interest
was
recognized
as
justifying
virtually
all
forms
of
economic
activity
including
product
boycotts.
and
as
the
court
will
recall,
allen
bradley
involved
an
area
product
boycott
in
new
york
city,
much
like
that
we
have
here.
it
was
if
you
please
a
pure
embargo
type
boycott.
local
3
there
would
not
install
prefabricated
and
other
electrical
products
made
outside
of
the
city.
it
wasn't
concerned
with
the
manufacturers
or
they
were,
whether
they
had
unions
or
what
their
working
conditions
were,
they
--
or
their
union
status.
they
even
barred
products
from
across
the
water
in
jersey
city.
now,
in
that
case,
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
union
was
obviously
work
for
its
members.
but
the
immediate
objective
as
a
means
to
that
goal
was
the
boycott
of
the
blacklisted
products.
now,
this
court
of
course
held
that
the
union
conspiracy
with
--
combined
with
non-labor
entities
violated
the
sherman
act.
but
the
significant
dictum
which
triggered
the
taft-hartley
act
was
that
similar
boycotts
by
the
union
acting
alone
were
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
this
was
the
thrust
of
the
case
and
its
impact
on
congressional
thinking
in
1947.
the
legislative
history
is
revealed
in
our
brief
at
110
and
i
want
to
refer
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
the
brief
of
amicus
associate
general
--
associated
general
contractors
of
pages
43
to
50.
and
i
mentioned
here
just
three
factors
of
that
history
if
i
may.
the
first
is
this.
in
connection
with
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
allen
bradley
was
the
most
commonly
cited
reason
for
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
congress
went
after
congress
then
testified
that
that
was
one
of
the
kind
of
boycotts,
that
was
intended
to
be
outlawed
by
the
act.
and
in
the
senate
report
no.
105
itself,
this
is
referred
to
and
even
the
committee
hearings
explaining
it,
are
incorporated
by
reference.
it
is
the
one
under
theory
in
other
words
that
your
honors
that
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
directed
against
the
embargo
type
products
that
we
had
that
was
in
aden
--
allen
bradley
and
that
we
have
here.
now,
the
second
history,
historical
point,
that
debates
are
full
or
pleased
by
the
taft-hartley
opponents
to
save
what
they
call
justifiable
boycotts.
and
these
were
referred
to
as
boycotts
made
by
non-union
people,
boycotts
where
there
were
subcon
--
substandard
conditions
or
boycotts
to
keep
union
men
from
having
to
work
with
non-union
members.
but
nobody
in
that
whole
history
tried
to
defend
or
justify
these
pure
product
embargo
boycotts
such
as
allen
bradley
and
the
present
case.
these
were
recognized
as
indefensible
and
for
instance,
congressman
javits
who
is
one
of
the
leading
opponents
of
the
taft
act,
pleading
to
say
what
he
called
justifiable
boycotts
said
this,
and
we
quote
this
in
our
brief
at
page
33,
"this
is
not
the
kind
of
boycott
which
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
that
other
kind
results
from
a
misguided
labor
union's
efforts
to
keep
certain
goods
out
of
a
market,
of
new
inventions
or
new
methods.
but
while
dealing
with
this
legitima
--
legitimate
abuse,
the
bill
also
has
the
effect
of
depriving
labor
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
now,
the
third
feature
of
the
history,
i
would
invite
your
attention,
to
which
i
invite
your
attention,
is
that
the
language
of
the
proscription
part
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
specifically
changed
in
conference
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
unions
could
no
longer
plead
self-interest
as
justification
for
secondary
boycotts
as
they
had
before
taft-hartley.
and
our
brief
on
that
--
covers
that
at
33
to
36.
now,
what
was
done?
the
words
"for
the
purpose
of
--
were
deleted
and
the
words
--
where
an
object
is"
were
inserted.
and
as
this
court
shortly
thereafter,
explained
in
the
denver
building
trade's
case,
our
brief
page
35,
this
change
was
to
take
care
of
the
situation
of
dual
union
objectives,
one
lawful
and
one
--
one
un
--
unlawful
as
we
have
in
this
case.
now,
the
legislative
purc
--
purpose
if
the
court
please
has
been
faithfully
carried
out
with
the
board
and
the
court
since
that
time.
the
crux
of
violation
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
existence
of
an
unlawful
objective
without
regard
to
factors
of
work
preservation
or
this
new
one,
this
new
so-called
control
idea
that
the
board
have,
and
these
cases
are
reviewed
at
35
to
44
of
our
brief.now,
i'll
mention
only
three
here
to
illustrate
the
point.
the
first
product
boycott
case
was
the
wadsworth's
case,
hardly
involved
a
boycott
of
prefabricated
building
materials.
the
union
in
kansas
refused
to
install
prefab
components
made
in
nebraska
because
of
an
organizational
argument
with
the
manufacturer.
but
the
point
here
is,
that
the
union's
whole
defense
was
economic
self-interest
which
they
had
successfully
pleaded
in
every
boycott
case
since
1932,
the
norris-laguardia
act
up
to
the
time
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
but
this
was
rejected
by
the
board
and
later
the
court.
and
the
board
said,
congress
considered
the
"product
boycott"
one
of
the
precise
evils
which
the
provision
was
designed
the
curve
and
chairman
herzog
concurring
said
congress
had
--
was
attempting
to
deal
a
death
blow,
the
secondary
boycotts,
whether
for
economic
or
for
other
reasons.
i
must
mention
then
the
joliet
contractors
case,
this
was
a
parallel
of
allen
bradley
and
the
present
case
here.
the
glaziers'
union
in
my
hometown
in
chicago
barred
all
of
the
glazing
in
that
area.
no
windows
glazed
at
the
factory,
no
window
units
could
be
used
there.
there
was
no
dispute
with
the
manufacturers,
it
was
a
typical
work
preservation
boycott,
all
must
be
done
on
the
jobsite.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
expressly
rejected
this
work
for
preservation
of
argument
in
the
absence
of
any
dispute
of
the
manufacturers,
and
why,
because
it
was
a
boycott
target.
and
it
said,
the
target
was
the
use
of
pre-glazed
sale
in
any
and
all
who
handled,
used
or
sold
such
sales,
or
the
intended
and
actual
victims
of
the
boycott.
now,
the
many
and
many
additional
cases
we
cite,
but
i
go
on
to
the
third
one
which
i
must
mention
as
one
of
our
leading
cases,
and
that
is
the
general
millwork
case
on
the
sixth
circuit,
our
brief
at
page
40.
now
they're
speaking
for
the
sixth
circuit,
mr.
justice
stewart
who
was
then
judge
stewart,
held
that
a
union
product
boycott
of
pre-hung
doors
which
are
the
--
the
same
type
of
doors
which
are
barred
in
philadelphia
here,
was
unlawful
despite
claims
of
work
preservation
and
the
absence
of
many
dispute
with
the
--
any
manufacturer,
because
the
union
objective
was
the
boycott
of
these
doors.
and
as
quoted
by
the
court
in
reference
to
the
absence
of
a
dispute
by
the
manufacturers,
"neither
literally
nor
implicitly
does
the
act
require
the
existence
of
such
a
dispute
as
a
condition
of
its
operation.
and
on
through
the
cases
until
landrum-griffin
in
1959,
when
the
--
this
provision
of
the
act
was
not
changed
except
by
strengthening
it,
and
we
find
at
that
time
that
landrum-griffin
as
the
court
has
undoubtedly
aware
was
to
plug
loopholes
in
the
taft-hartley
provision.
one
of
them
had
been
revealed
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
sand
door
case.
but
the
purpose
of
landrum-griffin
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
to
strengthen
the
act
and
the
apparent
reliance
of
the
court
below
on
this
primary
strike
proviso
which
was
added
--
was
misplaced.
this
proviso
was
added
to
merely
to
make
it
clear
because
of
a
change
that
has
been
made,
that
the
act
does
not
bar
primary
strikes
at
a
picket
line
and
so
forth,
such
had
been
held
not
to
have
been
barred
under
the
rice
milling
case,
and
the
same
principles
were
applied
in
the
cases
after
landrum-griffin
as
before.
now,
coming
to
this
control
theory
the
board
is
talking
about
now,
the
basic
fallacy
of
this
control
theory
as
applied
by
the
board,
is
that
it
makes
the
incidental
factor
of
the
immediate
employer's
ability
or
willingness
to
capitulate
to
the
boycott
demand,
control
or
determinative
of
the
union's
objective.
but
under
the
statute
in
the
cases,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
the
existence
of
an
actual
boycott
ob
--
objective
that's
controlling
and
not
the
legal
or
economic
ability
of
any
particular
employer
to
capitulate.
therefore,
when
this
board's
control
yardstick
points
to
a
different
objective
than
the
real
objective,
it
necessarily
conflicts
with
the
statute,
and
that's
what
happened
below.
since
contractor
frouge
had
control,
that
is
the
freedom
to
buy,
the
board
found
he
was
the
union's
sole
target.
but
it
is
patent
your
honors
that
the
union
had
the
same
boycott
target
on
the
frouge
job
as
on
the
other
three
jobs
for
a
violation
that
was
for
--
found.
by
enforcement
of
rule
17,
the
union
prevented
the
use
of
prefabricated
doors
on
all
four
jobs
and
the
only
way
its
goal
under
17
could
be
accomplished
on
frouge
as
the
other
three
was
by
the
prevention
of
the
use
of
these
prefabricated
doors.
on
his
brief
in
110
here,
the
board
seems
to
have
shifted
its
position.
and
in
large
part
to
have
abandoned
this
control
basis
of
its
decision,
that
all
--
i
appoint
it's
a
--
to
its
brief
in
110
at
page
19.
it
now
has
resurrected
this
long
discredited
theory
of
work
preservation
in
the
absence
of
a
dispute
with
the
employer,
and
it
seeks
to
justify
the
frouge
boycott
on
that
basis.
well,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
the
board's
shift
of
position
doesn't
help
its
case.
because
as
we've
seen,
neither
of
these
factors
has
ever
been
a
defense
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
cases.
now,
perhaps
the
quick
answer,
the
best
quick
answer,
that
the
board's
new
contention
is
its
findings
on
what
it
told
the
court
below
as
to
its
findings
of
violation
on
the
first
three
job.
on
all
four
jobs,
including
the
three
where
violations
were
found,
the
factors
of
work
preservation
in
the
absence
of
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer
on
which
the
board
now
relies
were
the
same.
and
citing
the
same
cases
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
reading
from
their
brief
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
and
the
--
i'm
reading
now
--
as
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
110,
page
5,
from
their
brief
in
the
seventh
circuit
below,
reply
brief
110,
page
5.
now,
what
they
told
the
court
was,
they
first
pointed
out
that
the
absence
of
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer
was
utterly
immaterial
and
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
the
--
before
the
court
of
appeal
in
sustaining
the
findings
of
violations
on
the
first
three
jobs.
the
board
told
the
court
that
these
things
were
true,
you
see.
on
the
first
three
jobs
they
found
violations.
they
found
violations
on
the
first
three
jobs
for
precisely
the
same
reason,
they
now
say
are
not
the
reason
for
the
violation
on
the
frouge
job.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly
correct.
on
the
8
(b)
(4)
point
below,
the
decision
is
pure
control.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
sir?
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
pointing
out
two
things,
if
the
court
please.
first,
they
change
their
position
and
secondly
they
are
wrong
anyhow.
and
i
merely
say
that
what
they
told
the
seventh
circuit
below
was
exactly
the
law,
insofar
as
we
can
find
it.
now,
going
on,
they
told
the
court
below
that
work
preservation
wasn't
the
defense
and
i
am
contending
to
read
because
the
union's
refusal
to
handle
the
doors
was
unlawful.
and
"its
sudden
law
that
if
an
object
of
union's
activity
is
unlawful,
other
lawful
activities
do
not
insulate
its
conduct
from
the
reach
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b)".
and
so
concluding
this
first
110
point,
we
submit
your
honors
that
the
boycott
of
prefab
doors
on
the
frouge
job
violated
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
just
as
the
boycotts
on
the
other
three
jobs.
there's
no
valid
difference.
now,
the
second
case
number
111
is
covered
by
our
brief
and
that
case
of
course
and
our
reference
it'll
be
to
it.
here,
we
contend
the
rule
17
violated
8
(e)
as
found
by
the
court
below.
now
i'd
like
to
first
take
a
quick
look
at
this
rule
17
itself
again.
our
111
brief,
you'll
find
it
at
the
bottom
of
page
4.
the
core
of
this
rule,
no
member
will
handle
material
coming
from
a
mill
where
prefabrication
has
been
done.
now,
what
mill?
any
mill
in
the
united
states
your
honors
that
sought
to
make
and
sell
and
to
distribute
prefabricated
doors
in
philadelphia.
the
admitted
purpose
of
rule
17
was
to
close
philadelphia
to
these
thousands
of
prefabricated
doors
that
had
been
flowing
into
the
area.
now,
there's
no
real
dispute
to
that.
union
manager
gray
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
that
you
would
have
--
would
have
to
your
honor,
decide
the
meaning
of
the
words
"will
not
use
prefabricated
doors."
now,
whether
in
arriving
at
that
meaning,
you
took
into
consideration
the
effect,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
that
whether
you
have
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
now
we
have
just
finished
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
point.
if
we
--
if
there
was
a
strike
to
enforce
that
and
the
effect
of
it
was
that
the
doors
were
not
used
you'd
have
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
boycott.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
we'll
i'm
--
we'll
come
to
that
on
that
point.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
it
would
be
precisely
the
same,
and
an
illustration
is
the
rule
in
the
joliet
contractor's
case
which
was
phrased
the
other
way.
it
was
all
glazing
will
be
done
on
the
glass
jobsite.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes
it
would,
because
your
honor,
for
whatever
the
man's
doing
at
the
local
job,
the
effect
of
it
has
an
embargo
impact
of
breaking
off
relations
between
them
and
others.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
the
fibreboard
case
forts
--
if
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
the
fibreboard
case
involved
if
the
court
please,
the
bargaining
case.
whether
it
was
bargaining,
collect
--
or
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining
on
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
no.
let's
assume
that
that
has
the
effect
of
--
of
establishing
a
--
a
legal
position.
that
had
to
do
with
the
subcontracting
of
work
--
in
of
maintenance
work
in
the
physical
confines
of
a
plant.
now,
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
whatever
may
be
the
situation
under
8
(e)
of
the
subcontracting
of
work
propositions
that
when
you
have
a
boycott
of
a
product,
of
a
product
that's
made
elsewhere
you
have
a
different
condition.
and
we
hope
to
be
able
to
satisfy
the
court
of
that.
now,
coming
with
this
8
(e),
there's
no
dispute
that
this
was
employed
to
keep
doors
out
of
philadelphia.
manager
gray
said
that
rule
of
prohibited
doors
and
that
contractors
who
use
the
doors
were
breaching
our
agreement.
and
that
he
intended
to
prevent
the
use
of
such
doors
by
enforcement
of
rule
17
throughout
his
jurisdictional
area.
now,
i'd
like
to
consider
the
application
of
8
(e)
to
this
rule.
section
8
(e)
prohibits
employers
and
the
union
from
handling
the
products
of
any
other
employer.
in
other
words,
it
expressly
applies
to
8
(e).
and
the
board
concedes
this,
i
think
at
page
111
--
in
its
brief
at
111
at
page
11.
that
the
language
of
8
(e)
expressly
covers
rule
(e).
so
what's
the
problem
here?
there
was
--
that
the
court
below
found
no
problem.
but
i
submit
that
the
problem
is,
that
the
board
has
engrafted
on
8
(e),
an
administratively
devised
exemption
for
primary
work
preservation
agreements.
now,
we
think
the
board
is
wrong.
by
its
fixation
on
work
preservation,
the
board
has
disregarded
the
specific
prohibition
of
agreements
to
boycott
the
products
of
others
which
is
written
in
the
8
(e).
now,
these
agreements
have
dual
objectives,
the
work
preservations
are
probably
but
certainly,
the
objective
of
boycotting
products
of
other
people.
now,
i
think
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
board
is
reverting
to
the
hutcheson
case
concept
that
union
self-interest
excuses
product
boycotts.
but
as
we've
seen,
congress
intended
taft-hartley
to
change
that
situation
and
there's
no
certain
that
congress
had
the
same
intention
when
it
enacted
8
(e)
in
1955.
now,
the
board
tries
to
justify
as
departure
from
the
strict
language
of
the
act
by
saying
that
it
can't
be
interpreted
literally
because
that
would
ban
all
primary
strikes.
although
we
submit
that's
not
a
relevant
argument
here.
it's
true
as
the
court
explains
in
rice
milling,
that
this
does
not
ban
primary
strikes
and
so
forth.because
the
picket
line
interference
is
incidental.
but
here,
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
apply
literally,
doesn't
give
the
board
free
reign
to
depart
from
the
act
in
other
situations
and
write
in
its
own
limitations.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
agree
your
honor.
i
agree
that
they
should
be.
and
just
the
question
which
--
which
tail
wag,
which
dog
i
think.
now,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
denver,
the
key
in
these
cases
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
union's
real
objection.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
this
distinction,
in
the
conventional
strike,
the
--
the
working
conditions
and
recognition
and
the
like.
the
boycott
of
other
people
is
not
the
objective
of
the
union.
the
interference
with
others
is
only
incidental
to
the
basic
strike.
but
when
the
boycott
of
other
people
becomes
a
subject
of
the
strike,
the
boycott
is
not
incidental
but
certainly
is
the
and
at
least
an
object
of
the
strike.
the
struck
employer
is
powerless
to
grant
the
union's
demand
except
by
boycotting
and
discontinuing
the
handling
of
the
products
of
other
people
and
in
philadelphia
here
for
instance.
these
contractors
could
not
comply
with
rule
17,
except
by
boycotting
the
products
of
our
charging
parties
in
this
case.
now,
the
answer
of
course
is
what
congress
intended
and
the
legislative
history
on
8
(e)
is
an
important
factor
here.
we
submit
that
the
congressional
intent
on
the
phase
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
that
8
(e)
was
intended
to
outlaw
boycott
rules
just
like
17.
now,
of
course
8
(e)
was
intended
to
complement
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
this
court's
decision
in
sand
door
pointed
out
that
a
boycott
agreement
although
not
a
defense,
although
a
--
a
defense
in
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
case
was
lawful
in
itself.
now,
the
congress
faced
with
this
decision,
concluded
that
agreements
to
boycott
like
consummated
boycotts
should
be
outlawed
as
against
public
policy
and
they
did
so.
now,
the
legislative
history
has
reviewed
in
our
brief
at
pages
19
to
35,
on
the
brief
of
the
associate
general
contractors
50
to
59.
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
only
a
few
significant
features
of
it.
first,
the
board's
contention
that
the
legislative
references
to
teamsters
'hot
cargo'
agreements,
evidences
an
intent
to
exclude
other
forms
of
boycott
agreements,
just
was
wrong.
now,
here's
what
happened.
the
original
kennedy-ives
bill,
which
was
introduced
in
january
1959,
contained
only
labor
reform.
the
taft-hartley
proponents
wanted
to
get
in
amendments.
now,
to
get
on
to
this
reformed
legislative
bandwagon
so
to
speak,
they
had
to
have
our
whipping
boy
and
they
picked
out
the
teamsters
union
on
'hot
cargo'.
and
they
succeeded
in
the
senate
in
getting
an
amendment
which
may
ban
boycott
agreements
in
the
transportation
industry
and
they
tried
to
expand
that
there
but
they
failed.
in
the
house,
however,
they
broadened
this
to
include
a
prohibition
against
agreements
to
boycott
by
all
employers.
and
the
after
the
conference
accept
this
as
the
breadth,
breadth
of
this
new
provision,
senator
kennedy
himself
explained
it
as
follows
and
i
refer
to
our
brief
111
of
page
28.
the
landrum-griffin
bill
extended
the
'hot
cargo'
provisions
of
the
senate
bill
which
we
applied
only
the
teamsters
to
all
agreements
between
an
employer
and
the
labor
union
by
which
the
employer
agrees
not
to
do
business
with
another
concerned.
so
after
broadening,
'hot
cargo'
became
synonymous
with
an
agreement
to
boycott
the
products
of
other
employers.
now,
the
second
feature
of
the
act,
of
the
legislative
history,
from
january
28
until
september
3rd,
every
admin
--
every
landrum-griffin
bill
that
was
introduced
and
there
were
lot
of
them,
contained
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
itself,
a
proscription
against
an
agreement
to
boycott.
in
other
words,
it
necessarily
had
to
be
as
broad
as
the
section
itself.
now,
this
provision
was
dropped
from
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
conference
september
3rd.
only
after
the
conferees
were
satisfied
and
said,
they
were
satisfied
that
8
(e)
was
as
broad
as
the
8
(b)
provision
had
been,
and
we've
covered
this
at
page
25
on
our
brief.
now
third,
all
of
the
opponents
of
8
(e)
in
the
congress,
clearly
understood
the
broad
sweep
of
the
section
and
reportedly
said
so,
our
brief
at
27
to
30.
now,
after
pleading
for
the
same
justifiable
boycotts
as
they
had
in
1947,
they
accepted
the
broad
scope
of
8
(e)
with
only
two
exceptions.
the
limited
one
for
the
construction
industry
i
referred
to
and
the
broad
one
for
the
apparel
industry.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
worked
at
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
that
is
a
--
a
possibility
if
you
wanted
to
view
it
that
way,
except
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
that's
possibly
true.
viewing
it
--
viewing
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct,
that's
what
they're
arguing
here.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
right.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
your
honor
is
exactly
correct
and
even
more
than
that,
this
proviso
as
you
say
points
out
for
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
senator
kennedy
himself
wrote
the
proviso,
pointed
out
if
the
proviso
does
not
cover
boycotts
of
goods
manufactured
in
an
industrial
plant
for
installation
at
the
jobsite
or
suppliers
who
do
not
work
at
the
jobsite.
now,
there
were
repeated
references
to
the
reason
for
that
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
meticulous
care
with
which
the
proponents
pointed
out
that
products
made
offsite
were
not
within
the
proviso
demonstrates
their
belief,
the
section
8
(e)
--
(8)
(e)
itself
covered
such,
otherwise
there
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
would
have
been
meaningless.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
sir?
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that
section
8
(e)
itself
covers
or
bar
such,
otherwise
there'd
be
no
meaning
to
the
point
that
the
prefabricated
--
the
proviso
did
not
cover
the
offsite
products.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
would
excuse
--
a
large
extent
your
honor.
in
this
respect,
just
as
congress
did.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
let's
--
the
basic
thing
is,
what
did
the
man
boycotted
the
product
intent,
and
what
did
he
do?
now,
if
the
intention
is
to
bar
products
made
offsite,
at
least
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
do
you
have
illegality?
now,
whether
there
are
additional
illegalities
with
reference
to
restraints
on
subcontract
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well
and
--
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
insofar
as
the
proviso
application
occurs,
it
is
expressly
by
statute
limited
to
onsite
situations.
but
the
question
i
think
you're
asking
is
this
and
my
--
that
can
the
contractor
and
the
union,
with
the
purest
of
motives,
work
preservation
law
of
everything
else
make
a
boycott
agreement
that
products
manufactured
by
other
people,
away
from
there
can't
be
used
in
this
area,
i
say
violates
8
(e).
now
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes
i
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
appreciate
your
question
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
so.
and
so
far
as
the
embargo
aspect
of
this
sort
of
agreement
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
is
concerned,
such
as
you
had
in
allen
bradley.
i
can't
conceive
for
instance
your
honor
that
an
agreement
barring
the
products
that
were
held
illegal
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
or
would
have
been
under
allen
bradley
situation,
would
be
legal
under
8
(e)
and
joliet
contractors,
the
agreement
not
to
permit
pre-glazed
doors
to
come
in
to
chicago.
now,
i
am
going
to
pass
the
thing
which
i
think
we've
discussed
that
these
cases
must
be
--
these
statutes
must
be
construed
to
me
in
the
same
thing,
they
are
close
in
pari
materia,
and
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
that
the
argument
which
tail
wags,
which
dog
possibly,
is
my
position
that
my
dog
was
there
forced
and
the
tail
was
tucked
on
to
it.
now,
the
board
cites
a
number
of
work
assignment
cases
of
subcontracting
cases
which
i
can
only
touch
here
because
of
the
time
situation.
it's
our
view
that
these
subcontracting
cases
which
have
to
do
with
who
will
do
work
in
these
local
jurisdictional
situations,
involved
special
problems
such
as
common
situs
problems,
such
as
this
court
had
in
the
general
electric
case
of
the
common
--
the
extra
gain
and
all
of
that.
and
whatever
may
be
the
eventual
law
on
these
subcontracting
cases
and
the
writers
are
still
debating
how
that's
going
to
come
out.
we
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
an
agreement
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
alright,
fine.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
make
the
same
argument
because
of
the
embargo
pact
--
impact
on
products
manufactured
by
other
people.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly.
yes.
now,
we
just
--
we
distinguished
these
work
assignment
cases,
we
hope
the
subcontracting
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
we
have
here
a
product
embargo
and
not
a
work
assignment.
because,
we
contend
that
it's
one
thing
to
divide
up
the
work
after
products
have
come
to
a
job
or
an
area,
as
to
which
union
is
going
to
put
on
this
or
that.
it's
another
thing
to
draw
a
line
around
that
place
and
say
what
products
can
come
there
to
the
first
instance.
in
the
one
case,
your
subcontracting
work,
in
the
other
case
you're
embargoing
products
which
we
think
is
outside
the
scope
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
no,
i
would
--
your
honors,
how
this
subcontracting
thing
is
going
to
come
out,
i
don't
know.
i
would
say
that
the
fibreboard's
impact
certainly
is
relate
--
first,
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
it
was
limited
to
the
specific
type
of
subcontracts
there
involved.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
happened
to
be
a
maintenance
one,
but
it
has
broader
scope
in
that.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
and
the
work
you
were
talking
about
in
any
event
your
honor
was
going
to
be
done
on
the
premises.
it
was
not
dealing
with
work
that
would
be
done
elsewhere
in
wisconsin
instead
of
philadelphia.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
the
basis
of
our
distinction.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
so
that
has
to
be
a
line
some
place.
if
someone
is
subcontracting
cases
are
going
to
be
found
labeled,
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere
between
them
and
the
product
boycott
situation,
where
that
line
is
going
to
be,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that
would
be
violative
of
8
(e)
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
in
the
same
manner
as
a
like
agreement
with
another
employer
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
it
does,
unless
you
make
a
distinction.
i
think
it
does
unless
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
localized
nature
of
work
on
a
premises,
the
same
thing
you
get
involved
any
of
your
common
situs
cases
and
something
that
has
an
embargo
effect
reaching
out
and
disturbing
the
products
that
can
move
in
the
channels
of
distribution.
and
--
we
say
the
rest
of
distinction
between
these
localized
situations
how
you
divide
up
work,
and
one
which
draws
a
line
around
a
thing
and
keeps
these
products
out.
now,
and
i
think
it
couldn't
be
better
said
if
the
court
please,
than
in
the
first
joliet
contractor's
case.
at
page
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
joliet
contractors.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
the
case
in
51.
the
board
reasoning
ignores
the
fact
that
the
real
effect
of
a
secondary
boycott
in
the
building
and
construction
industry
is
the
stoppage
of
the
flow
of
building
materials
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
dealer
and
to
the
contractor.
and
it's
that
curtain
effect
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
embargo
thing.
now
in
conclusion,
we
want
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
briefs
of
the
amici
here
and
explain
that
we
agree
with
them
as
to
the
very
serious
economic
effects
on
the
public
interest
if
these
boycott
immunities,
these
whole
city
boycotts
are
going
to
be
permitted
to
continue
in
this
country.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
thank
you
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
your
honor
has
a
point,
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
few
minutes,
i
have
left,
if
the
court
please
i'd
like
to
stress
just
two
points.
first,
to
the
control
point
to
which
mr.
manoli
has
just
addressed
himself
and
second
to
this
primary
and
secondary
dichotomy
which
the
board
presses
when
it
suits
a
purpose
and
disregards
when
it
doesn't.
now
first,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
we
must
remember
that
in
this
case,
this
union
boycott
on
all
four
jobs
prevented
the
use
of
prefabricated
doors
and
rule
17
prevented
the
use
of
prefabricated
doors
in
philadelphia.
now
let's
look
at
this
control
theory.
i
don't
know
what
the
board
means.
it
changes
its
view
on
it
but
at
best,
a
control
is
an
evidentiary
guide
where
you
have
a
mixed
up
common-situs
situation
where
you
have
obscure
objectives.
at
best
that's
it.
now
it
serves
no
purpose
where
you
have
a
clear
cut
objective
anymore
than
any
other
presumption
of
evidence,
where
you
have
a
clear
cut
evidence
of
objective
against
boycott
doors
which
you
have
here.
now,
i
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
if
--
you
honor,
i'm
glad
you
ask
that.
in
this
case
there
is
no
neutral
employer.
there's
always
a
fight
between
the
union
and
the
local
contractor
about
prefabric
--
about
using
somebody
else's
doors.
there's
a
three-way
fight.
there
is
no
neutral.
this
talk
about
neutral
employers
just
doesn't
fit
here.
now,
on
the
control
theory,
let's
apply
it
below.
whatever
trust
control
had,
where
did
it
point?
it
pointed
only
to
the
con
--
project
owner
on
the
three
jobs
where
the
doors
were
specified.
not
elsewhere.
that's
the
only
place
it
could
point,
whatever
thrust
it
had.
but
what
did
the
board
claim?
that
the
objective
was
not
only
the
owners
but
the
manufacturers
and
the
distributors
of
the
door,
there
it
saw
irrespective
of
controller
on
the
three
jobs
where
violations
were
found.
there
was
found
a
boycott
objective
against
doors
and
the
manufacturers.
and
so
with
frouge,
it
was
identically
the
same.
whatever
trust
control
had
pointing
at
frouge,
was
purely
incidental
because
on
that
case
the
boycott
objective
was
precisely
the
same.
it
was
against
the
prefabricated
doors.
now,
i
want
to
hit
this
next
point
on
this
primary,
secondary
formula.
if
the
court
please,
a
reading
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
you're
right
your
honor,
nothing
on
this
primary
secondary
business.
in
the
first
place,
if
a
reading
in
the
board's
case
reveals
that
this
formula
is
applied
in
about
a
third
of
their
cases
and
the
court
cases
in
the
sense
of
a
one-two-three
dispute,
it
doesn't
work
out
that
way.
now,
there
are
many
boycott
situations
that
involve
the
one-two-three
business.
but
many
product
boycotts
which
congress
intended
to
eliminate
clearly
do
not
involve
those
and
i
cite
allen
bradley.
and
if
the
court
please,
my
good
friend,
mr.
manoli
misquotes
this
case
completely
because
in
that
case,
the
union
was
not
concerned
with
nonunion
products
from
elsewhere
or
other
things.
it
barred
all
products
regardless
of
union
affiliations.
i
pointed
out,
it
barred
products
from
a
sister
--
local
over
in
jersey
city.
and
he
didn't
finish
the
quote
from
senator
taft.
he
said,
“we
will
not
permit
any
material".
this
is
--
he's
talking
about
the
bradley
case.
this
is
page
63
in
our
briefs.
we
will
not
permit
any
material
made
by
any
other
union
or
any
nonunion
worker
to
come
into
new
york
city
and
to
be
put
in
to
any
building
in
new
york.
they
just
can't
bring
it
in,
union
or
nonunion,
they
didn't
care.
the
principle
announced
by
the
senator
of
florida
would
make
that
stand
lawful
as
it
is
lawful
today.
of
course,
we
proposed
to
change
the
law
in
that
effect.
and
gentlemen,
the
impact
of
allen
bradley
in
congress
and
the
impact
in
the
cases
for
20
years
has
been
that
it
was
an
embargo
type
product
--
boycott.
now
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
sir
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
it
might
except
congress
has
already
considered
that
situation.
certainly,
the
union
has
the
right
and
the
employer
have
the
right
to
control
what
work
is
done
with
reference
to
things
which
come
to
the
jobsite.
the
proviso
expressly
provides
that.
but
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
the
point
of
it
is,
what
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
they
can
divide
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
and
this
law
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
this
proviso,
if
the
court
please
was
directed
to
that.
it's
the
localized
situation,
a
mixed
up
thing
which
you
have
in
your
common-situs
in
other
case.
but
congress
looking
at
it
said,
and
senator
taft
said,
and
everybody
else
said,
this
proviso
does
not
apply
to
products
manufactured
at
the
job
--
away
from
the
factory
to
be
brought
in
here.
why?
because
the
freedom
they
were
giving,
these
restrictive
contracts
was
lo
--
limited
to
the
localized
situation.
and
in
the
general
miller
work,
if
the
court
please,
there
was
no
agreement
there
at
all.
there
was
a
debate
about
the
agreement.
and
there
was
a
debate
whether
it
had
a
union
label
clause
like
ours
here.
and
there
was
a
debate
about
whether
it
banned
on
pre-hanged
doors
but
the
crux
of
the
decision
and
the
reason
for
the
court's
decision,
i
presumed
to
suggest.
and
the
board's
decision
was
that
there
was
boycott
on
prefabricated
doors
and
the
justice's
recollection
that
is
absolutely
correct.
now,
on
--
so
much
for
this
primary
secondary
dispute
business,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
write
primary
secondary
and
secondary
boycotts
into
the
act,
it
could
readily
have
done
so.
and
in
the
1959
legislature,
every
bill
of
the
opponents
of
the
landrum-griffin
amendments
put
into
their
bill
a
primary
secondary
dichotomy,
which
the
board's
talking
about,
everyone
of
them,
the
elliott
bill
and
the
shelly
bill
and
the
roosevelt
bill.
and
congress
expressed
--
they
wrote
it
into
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
and
congress
expressly
rejected
that
bill
and
then
adopted
instead
the
landrum-griffin
bill
which
does
not
have
any
such
prescription.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
senator
pepper
was
arguing
the
same
principle
but
back
in
1947
in
connection
with
the
original
taft-hartley
amendments,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes,
and
he
--
in
that
connection
cited
the
quote
that
i
quoted
about

ago.
now,
with
reference
to
this
matter
of
work
preservation,
may
i
suggest
this;
the
government's
argument
here
that
work
preservation
as
a
sole
objective
is
academic
in
this
case.
the
argument
that
8
(e)
does
not
ban
sole
work
preservation
objectives
--
agreements
is
academic
here
because
rule
17
by
--
i
feel
any
realistic
appraisal
had
dual
objectives.
it
had
the
work
preservation
objective
but
your
honors,
the
most
obvious
objective
if
one
can
read
and
see
and
understand
what
the
court
and
the
board
said
is
that
another
objective
was
to
ban
prefabricated
doors
from
philadelphia.
and
that's
what
it
did,
4000
of
them.
and
they're
not
going
in
yet.
now,
that
being
the
case,
this
is
what
the
court
talked
about
in
denver
building
trades
case,
that
this
statute
contemplates
dual
objectives.
and
that
the
existence
of
the
lawful
objective
does
not
excuse
an
unlawful
objective.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
so
glad
you
asked
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
because
that
provides
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
the
distinction
between
this
primary
strike
business
the
board
is
talking
about
and
a
real
proscribed
objective.
now,
the
propend
--
the
primary
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
oh,
no.
i
am
arguing
that
the
board
sees
only
primary
activity.
it's
--
it
looks
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
then
you
have
illegality
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
now
that
--
you
mean
the
primary
strike
proviso?
because
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
your
honor,
the
primary
strike
proviso
came
from
the
international
rice
milling
case.
and
it
said
that
a
primary
strike
in
picket
lines
at
that
strike
premises
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
again
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
oh!
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
alright.
on
the
face
of
the
proviso,
the
proviso
does
not
permit
the
act
to
apply
the
primary
strike.
and
that's
--
statutory
pur
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
strikes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
the
primary
strikes
or
picketing,
the
proviso,
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
one
you're
talking
about,
yes.
now
that
was
merely
to
make
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
huh?
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
there
was
a
strike
here.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
on
the
purpose
of
that
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
it
is
a
primary
strike
for
a
proscribed
objective.
now,
to
illustrate
the
international
rice
milling
situation
if
i
may
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
if
the
trucks
which
approached
that
kaplan
plant
which
was
struck
had
been
stopped
by
the
pickets
because
the
trucks
were
full
of
prefabricated
doors
manufactured
elsewhere
under
the
reasoning
of
that
case
and
the
other
three
decided
the
same
day,
i
am
sure
this
court
would
have
held
it
illegal.
but
their
dispute
was
not
because
of
that,
their
dispute
was
with
the
kaplan
mill
for
recognition
and
the
like.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
say
that
would
have
been
a
valid
thing
but
it
isn't
necessary.
the
court
and
the
boards
for
instance,
your
honor
have
never
required
the
existence
of
a
primary
dispute
to
trigger
the
sanctions
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly.
and
fibreboard,
your
honor,
if
you
come
down
to
it
and
read
it
on
its
limitations,
it
is
not
in
the
collision
course
with
a
violation
of
8
(e)
because
they're
in
different
ballparks.
if
you
read
fibreboard
as
limited
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
as
limit
--
i'm
sorry.
as
limited
by
your
opinion
and
the
restrictions
on
fibreboard,
it
had
to
do
with
subcontracting
on
the
site
and
it
did
not
reach
the
subject
of
the
boycott
of
prefabricated
products
coming
to
the
site.
and
the
parallel
with
the
proviso
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
same.
they
permitted
these
agreements
on
the
site
but
made
it
clear
that
the
8
(e)
proviso
did
not
validate
boycotts
of
fabricated
products
made
away
from
the
site.
and
the
parallel
is
the
same
and
the
distinction
of
fibreboard
is
the
same
as
the
proviso
in
8
(e),
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
consists
of
companies
that
make
doors
and
millwork.
they
manufacture
prefabricated
doors
that
are
used
in
constructions
throughout
the
united
states
in
the
philadelphia
area.
this
case
involves
a
product
boycott
of
these
prefabricated
doors
in
philadelphia
by
the
philadelphia
carpenters
union,
and
this
went
on
throughout
its
five-county
jurisdictional
area.
now,
the
specific
questions
are,
in
number
110,
whether
the
union's
boycott
of
doors
on
a
so-called
frouge
job,
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
act,
that
labor
relations
act,
and
in
number
111,
whether
the
boycott
agreement
of
union
rule
17
violated
section
8
(e)
of
the
act.
but
your
honors
there's
a
broader
question
in
this
case,
a
question
of
principle.
and
that
is,
whether
unions
throughout
the
country
can
draw
boycott
curtains
about
their
respective
communities,
banning
there
from
factory-made
products
and
factory-finished
products
of
many
kinds.
because
if
the
philadelphia
union
can
draw
a
--
an
embargo
upon
prefabricated
doors
in
that
city,
the
electrical
workers
union
in
allen
bradley
may
resume
its
boycott
of
electrical
equipment
and
prefabricated
products
in
that
case.
the
glaziers'
union
in
the
chicago
joliet
contractors
case
can
resume
their
boycott
of
pre-glazed
factory-made
windows
and
over
in
cincinnati,
the
carpenters
union
can
resume
its
boycott
of
pre-hung
doors
as
in
general
millwork,
and
on
and
on.
and
that
is
the
reason
your
honors,
this
public
detriment,
this
adverse
effect
is
the
reasons
so
many
industries
throughout
the
country
are
before
the
court
here
today
as
amici
curiae
stressing
the
illegality
of
this
sort
of
union
boycotts.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
in
the
other
cases,
the
same
provision
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
the
cases
i
referred
to,
except
down
in
allen
bradley
which
i'll
refer
to
as
an
antitrust
case.
i'll
come
to
the
cases
specifically
too
your
honor.
now,
the
statutory
provisions
are
contained
in
our
brief
in
number
110
at
page
2
and
i
might
mention
that
our
brief
in
that
case
is
a
consol
--
has
a
consolidated
caption
of
110
and
111,
and
i
ask
that
you
disregard
the
number
111
on
that
white
document
and
strike
it
if
you
care
to.
now,
an
offense
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
embodies
two
elements,
union
inducement
of
employees
to
strike
or
coercion
of
an
employer
for
an
object
of
requiring
any
person
to
cease
handling
of
products
of
another
producer
or
manufacturer
or
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
the
other
statutory
provision
is
section
8
(e).
now,
this
was
enacted
in
1959
to
complement
and
close
a
loophole
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
now,
this
section
then
in
essence
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
union
and
an
employer
to
enter
into
any
agreement
that
the
employer
will
cease
handling
the
products
of
any
other
person
or
cease
doing
ba
--
business
with
any
other
person.
now,
the
8
(e)
provision
has
a
proviso
which
is
involved
here
and
that
is
that
there
is
exempted
from
8
(e),
agreements
in
the
construction
industry,
relating
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
if
the
court
please
is
to
state
brief
with
the
nature
of
the
case
then
go
to
the
110
case,
that's
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
then
the
111
case.
now,
the
facts
can
be
briefly
summarized
are
not
materially
in
dispute.
these
prefabricated
doors,
are
doors
which
are
sized,
cut,
pre-hung,
laminated,
treated
or
in
some
other
ways
substantially
fabricated
at
the
factory.
they
have
economic
and
aesthetic
advantages,
was
testified
and
they're
being
used
increasingly
in
construction
throughout
the
country.
the
core
of
the
union's
boycott
campaign
was
rule
17.
now,
the
key
part
of
this
rule
was,
and
it's
quoted
in
our
brief
110,
page
7,
beginning
at
the
second
sentence,
"no
member
of
this
district
counsel
will
handle
material
coming
from
a
mill
where
cutting
out
and
fitting
has
been
done."
and
going
on,
"nor
any
doors
or
transoms
which
have
been
fitted
prio
--
prior
to
being
finished
on
the
job."
now,
this
rule
17
by
its
terms
and
as
enforced
by
the
union,
barred
prefabricated
doors
from
philadelphia.
the
particular
difficulties
started
in
february
1963
when
the
philadelphia
union
manager
wrote
to
president
hutcheson
of
the
brotherhood
of
carpenters,
the
national
organization,
that
there
was
a
serious
problem
of
prefabricated
doors
flowing
into
philadelphia.
this
was
followed
by
the
campaign
to
bar
doors
and
that
resulted
in
the
four
cases
we
have
as
the
basis
of
this
case
today.
and
today,
there
are
boycotts
on
four
jobs,
hospital
jobs,
school
jobs
and
housing
job,
and
the
last
one
was
the
contractor
frouge
job
that
i
had
mentioned
earlier.
on
these
first
three
jobs,
the
prefab
doors
were
specified
by
the
owners.
on
the
frouge
job,
there
was
an
open
specification
on
frouge
that
he
used
these
doors
because
they
save
time
and
money.
but
the
essential
feature
of
the
case,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
the
union
conduct
on
all
four
jobs
was
exactly
the
same.
the
union
enforcing
rule
17,
refused
to
install
over
4000
jobs
--
doors,
made
by
manufacturers
in
wisconsin,
penns
--
pennsylvania
and
indiana
who
where
the
charging
parties
in
this
case.
now,
the
decisions
below,
on
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
were,
that
the
board
and
the
court
found,
that
the
union's
boycotts
on
these
first
three
jobs
were
illegal
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
because
the
real
targets
of
the
union
were
the
prefabricated
doors
and
those
who
manufactured
them
and
distributed
and
used
them.
the
court
likened
the
boycott
to
the
one
in
the
allen
bradley
case
and
the
joliet
contractors
case.
but
on
the
first
job,
the
board
held
there
was
no
violation
because
the
specifications
didn't
require
frouge
to
use
these
doors
and
under
the
board's
new
control
theory
which
is
the
issue
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
frouge
was
the
sole
objective
and
the
court
apparently
going
on
on
this
theory
agree.
with
reference
to
section
8
(e),
the
board
held
that
rule
17
was
only
a
work
preservation
rule,
non-violative
8
(e),
the
court
reversed
and
held
that
rule
17's
ban
on
the
prefabricated
doors
violated
8
(e).
now,
turning
first
to
the
110
case,
we
have
in
this
case
if
the
court
please,
a
typical
form
of
product
boycott,
which
is
consistently
been
held
illegal
for
20
years
except
for
these
recent
decisions
of
the
board
since
1947.
now,
this
marked
change
in
the
thinking
of
the
board,
as
revealed
by
the
fact
that
the
general
counsel
for
the
board
only
three
years
ago
in
accordance
with
his
then
understanding
of
the
law
filed
a
complaint
and
prosecuted
the
case
on
essentially
the
same
basis
that
we
are
contending
before
the
court
today.
now,
the
board
reversed
its
general
counsel
and
today
of
course
counsel
is
supporting
the
board's
current
position.
i'd
like
to
call
first
the
attention
at
our
brief
page
20
that
--
that
the
statutory
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
is
aimed
precisely
at
the
type
of
boycott
conduct
carried
on
by
the
union
under
rule
17.
the
language
is
plain,
contractor
frouge
as
a
person,
the
prefab
doors
which
he
was
forced
to
stop
using,
are
products
manufactured
by
other
producers.
now,
your
honors,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
nor
in
the
legal
history
that
provides
product
boycott
immunity
because
of
the
immediate
employer's
legal
freedom
to
comply
with
the
union's
boycott
demand,
nor
is
there
anything
which
relates
to
the
union's
desire
to
preserve
work.
on
the
contrary,
the
circumstances
which
led
directly
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
1947
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
to
outlaw
just
this
kind
of
a
boycott.
now,
as
i
reviewed
in
our
brief,
page
110
and
page
21,
a
prime
concern
of
congress,
and
this
is
a
very
important
point
i
think,
was
the
embargo
and
trade
restraint
aspects
of
product
boycotts.
although
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
a
labor
law
and
not
an
antitrust
law,
its
roots
are
grounded
in
antitrust
law.
now,
this
court
pointed
out
in
allen
bradley
applying
the
sherman
act
and
again
in
inter
--
international
rice
milling
in
applying
the
labor
act
that
this
court
over
the
years
has
been
concerned
with
two
congressional
objectives.
one,
which
seeks
to
preserve
a
business
--
competitive
business
economy
and
the
other
which
seeks
to
preserve
the
rights
of
labor
to
preserve
its
own
conditions.
but
your
honors,
the
problem
is
this,
that
in
its
recent
decisions,
the
board
has
come
to
disregard
this
first
congressional
objective
and
has
focused
almost
on
entirely
on
the
second
one,
namely
that
of
union
self-interest.
now
what
led
the
taft-hartley
in
the
beginning?
because
in
the
hutcheson
case,
by
this
court
and
others
--
other
cases
of
the
same
type,
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision,
1945
in
allen
bradley,
union
self-interest
was
recognized
as
justifying
virtually
all
forms
of
economic
activity
including
product
boycotts.
and
as
the
court
will
recall,
allen
bradley
involved
an
area
product
boycott
in
new
york
city,
much
like
that
we
have
here.
it
was
if
you
please
a
pure
embargo
type
boycott.
local
3
there
would
not
install
prefabricated
and
other
electrical
products
made
outside
of
the
city.
it
wasn't
concerned
with
the
manufacturers
or
they
were,
whether
they
had
unions
or
what
their
working
conditions
were,
they
--
or
their
union
status.
they
even
barred
products
from
across
the
water
in
jersey
city.
now,
in
that
case,
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
union
was
obviously
work
for
its
members.
but
the
immediate
objective
as
a
means
to
that
goal
was
the
boycott
of
the
blacklisted
products.
now,
this
court
of
course
held
that
the
union
conspiracy
with
--
combined
with
non-labor
entities
violated
the
sherman
act.
but
the
significant
dictum
which
triggered
the
taft-hartley
act
was
that
similar
boycotts
by
the
union
acting
alone
were
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
this
was
the
thrust
of
the
case
and
its
impact
on
congressional
thinking
in
1947.
the
legislative
history
is
revealed
in
our
brief
at
110
and
i
want
to
refer
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
the
brief
of
amicus
associate
general
--
associated
general
contractors
of
pages
43
to
50.
and
i
mentioned
here
just
three
factors
of
that
history
if
i
may.
the
first
is
this.
in
connection
with
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
allen
bradley
was
the
most
commonly
cited
reason
for
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
congress
went
after
congress
then
testified
that
that
was
one
of
the
kind
of
boycotts,
that
was
intended
to
be
outlawed
by
the
act.
and
in
the
senate
report
no.
105
itself,
this
is
referred
to
and
even
the
committee
hearings
explaining
it,
are
incorporated
by
reference.
it
is
the
one
under
theory
in
other
words
that
your
honors
that
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
directed
against
the
embargo
type
products
that
we
had
that
was
in
aden
--
allen
bradley
and
that
we
have
here.
now,
the
second
history,
historical
point,
that
debates
are
full
or
pleased
by
the
taft-hartley
opponents
to
save
what
they
call
justifiable
boycotts.
and
these
were
referred
to
as
boycotts
made
by
non-union
people,
boycotts
where
there
were
subcon
--
substandard
conditions
or
boycotts
to
keep
union
men
from
having
to
work
with
non-union
members.
but
nobody
in
that
whole
history
tried
to
defend
or
justify
these
pure
product
embargo
boycotts
such
as
allen
bradley
and
the
present
case.
these
were
recognized
as
indefensible
and
for
instance,
congressman
javits
who
is
one
of
the
leading
opponents
of
the
taft
act,
pleading
to
say
what
he
called
justifiable
boycotts
said
this,
and
we
quote
this
in
our
brief
at
page
33,
"this
is
not
the
kind
of
boycott
which
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
that
other
kind
results
from
a
misguided
labor
union's
efforts
to
keep
certain
goods
out
of
a
market,
of
new
inventions
or
new
methods.
but
while
dealing
with
this
legitima
--
legitimate
abuse,
the
bill
also
has
the
effect
of
depriving
labor
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
now,
the
third
feature
of
the
history,
i
would
invite
your
attention,
to
which
i
invite
your
attention,
is
that
the
language
of
the
proscription
part
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
specifically
changed
in
conference
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
unions
could
no
longer
plead
self-interest
as
justification
for
secondary
boycotts
as
they
had
before
taft-hartley.
and
our
brief
on
that
--
covers
that
at
33
to
36.
now,
what
was
done?
the
words
"for
the
purpose
of
--
were
deleted
and
the
words
--
where
an
object
is"
were
inserted.
and
as
this
court
shortly
thereafter,
explained
in
the
denver
building
trade's
case,
our
brief
page
35,
this
change
was
to
take
care
of
the
situation
of
dual
union
objectives,
one
lawful
and
one
--
one
un
--
unlawful
as
we
have
in
this
case.
now,
the
legislative
purc
--
purpose
if
the
court
please
has
been
faithfully
carried
out
with
the
board
and
the
court
since
that
time.
the
crux
of
violation
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
existence
of
an
unlawful
objective
without
regard
to
factors
of
work
preservation
or
this
new
one,
this
new
so-called
control
idea
that
the
board
have,
and
these
cases
are
reviewed
at
35
to
44
of
our
brief.now,
i'll
mention
only
three
here
to
illustrate
the
point.
the
first
product
boycott
case
was
the
wadsworth's
case,
hardly
involved
a
boycott
of
prefabricated
building
materials.
the
union
in
kansas
refused
to
install
prefab
components
made
in
nebraska
because
of
an
organizational
argument
with
the
manufacturer.
but
the
point
here
is,
that
the
union's
whole
defense
was
economic
self-interest
which
they
had
successfully
pleaded
in
every
boycott
case
since
1932,
the
norris-laguardia
act
up
to
the
time
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
but
this
was
rejected
by
the
board
and
later
the
court.
and
the
board
said,
congress
considered
the
"product
boycott"
one
of
the
precise
evils
which
the
provision
was
designed
the
curve
and
chairman
herzog
concurring
said
congress
had
--
was
attempting
to
deal
a
death
blow,
the
secondary
boycotts,
whether
for
economic
or
for
other
reasons.
i
must
mention
then
the
joliet
contractors
case,
this
was
a
parallel
of
allen
bradley
and
the
present
case
here.
the
glaziers'
union
in
my
hometown
in
chicago
barred
all
of
the
glazing
in
that
area.
no
windows
glazed
at
the
factory,
no
window
units
could
be
used
there.
there
was
no
dispute
with
the
manufacturers,
it
was
a
typical
work
preservation
boycott,
all
must
be
done
on
the
jobsite.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
expressly
rejected
this
work
for
preservation
of
argument
in
the
absence
of
any
dispute
of
the
manufacturers,
and
why,
because
it
was
a
boycott
target.
and
it
said,
the
target
was
the
use
of
pre-glazed
sale
in
any
and
all
who
handled,
used
or
sold
such
sales,
or
the
intended
and
actual
victims
of
the
boycott.
now,
the
many
and
many
additional
cases
we
cite,
but
i
go
on
to
the
third
one
which
i
must
mention
as
one
of
our
leading
cases,
and
that
is
the
general
millwork
case
on
the
sixth
circuit,
our
brief
at
page
40.
now
they're
speaking
for
the
sixth
circuit,
mr.
justice
stewart
who
was
then
judge
stewart,
held
that
a
union
product
boycott
of
pre-hung
doors
which
are
the
--
the
same
type
of
doors
which
are
barred
in
philadelphia
here,
was
unlawful
despite
claims
of
work
preservation
and
the
absence
of
many
dispute
with
the
--
any
manufacturer,
because
the
union
objective
was
the
boycott
of
these
doors.
and
as
quoted
by
the
court
in
reference
to
the
absence
of
a
dispute
by
the
manufacturers,
"neither
literally
nor
implicitly
does
the
act
require
the
existence
of
such
a
dispute
as
a
condition
of
its
operation.
and
on
through
the
cases
until
landrum-griffin
in
1959,
when
the
--
this
provision
of
the
act
was
not
changed
except
by
strengthening
it,
and
we
find
at
that
time
that
landrum-griffin
as
the
court
has
undoubtedly
aware
was
to
plug
loopholes
in
the
taft-hartley
provision.
one
of
them
had
been
revealed
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
sand
door
case.
but
the
purpose
of
landrum-griffin
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
to
strengthen
the
act
and
the
apparent
reliance
of
the
court
below
on
this
primary
strike
proviso
which
was
added
--
was
misplaced.
this
proviso
was
added
to
merely
to
make
it
clear
because
of
a
change
that
has
been
made,
that
the
act
does
not
bar
primary
strikes
at
a
picket
line
and
so
forth,
such
had
been
held
not
to
have
been
barred
under
the
rice
milling
case,
and
the
same
principles
were
applied
in
the
cases
after
landrum-griffin
as
before.
now,
coming
to
this
control
theory
the
board
is
talking
about
now,
the
basic
fallacy
of
this
control
theory
as
applied
by
the
board,
is
that
it
makes
the
incidental
factor
of
the
immediate
employer's
ability
or
willingness
to
capitulate
to
the
boycott
demand,
control
or
determinative
of
the
union's
objective.
but
under
the
statute
in
the
cases,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
the
existence
of
an
actual
boycott
ob
--
objective
that's
controlling
and
not
the
legal
or
economic
ability
of
any
particular
employer
to
capitulate.
therefore,
when
this
board's
control
yardstick
points
to
a
different
objective
than
the
real
objective,
it
necessarily
conflicts
with
the
statute,
and
that's
what
happened
below.
since
contractor
frouge
had
control,
that
is
the
freedom
to
buy,
the
board
found
he
was
the
union's
sole
target.
but
it
is
patent
your
honors
that
the
union
had
the
same
boycott
target
on
the
frouge
job
as
on
the
other
three
jobs
for
a
violation
that
was
for
--
found.
by
enforcement
of
rule
17,
the
union
prevented
the
use
of
prefabricated
doors
on
all
four
jobs
and
the
only
way
its
goal
under
17
could
be
accomplished
on
frouge
as
the
other
three
was
by
the
prevention
of
the
use
of
these
prefabricated
doors.
on
his
brief
in
110
here,
the
board
seems
to
have
shifted
its
position.
and
in
large
part
to
have
abandoned
this
control
basis
of
its
decision,
that
all
--
i
appoint
it's
a
--
to
its
brief
in
110
at
page
19.
it
now
has
resurrected
this
long
discredited
theory
of
work
preservation
in
the
absence
of
a
dispute
with
the
employer,
and
it
seeks
to
justify
the
frouge
boycott
on
that
basis.
well,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
the
board's
shift
of
position
doesn't
help
its
case.
because
as
we've
seen,
neither
of
these
factors
has
ever
been
a
defense
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
cases.
now,
perhaps
the
quick
answer,
the
best
quick
answer,
that
the
board's
new
contention
is
its
findings
on
what
it
told
the
court
below
as
to
its
findings
of
violation
on
the
first
three
job.
on
all
four
jobs,
including
the
three
where
violations
were
found,
the
factors
of
work
preservation
in
the
absence
of
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer
on
which
the
board
now
relies
were
the
same.
and
citing
the
same
cases
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
reading
from
their
brief
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
and
the
--
i'm
reading
now
--
as
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
110,
page
5,
from
their
brief
in
the
seventh
circuit
below,
reply
brief
110,
page
5.
now,
what
they
told
the
court
was,
they
first
pointed
out
that
the
absence
of
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer
was
utterly
immaterial
and
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
the
--
before
the
court
of
appeal
in
sustaining
the
findings
of
violations
on
the
first
three
jobs.
the
board
told
the
court
that
these
things
were
true,
you
see.
on
the
first
three
jobs
they
found
violations.
they
found
violations
on
the
first
three
jobs
for
precisely
the
same
reason,
they
now
say
are
not
the
reason
for
the
violation
on
the
frouge
job.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly
correct.
on
the
8
(b)
(4)
point
below,
the
decision
is
pure
control.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
sir?
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
pointing
out
two
things,
if
the
court
please.
first,
they
change
their
position
and
secondly
they
are
wrong
anyhow.
and
i
merely
say
that
what
they
told
the
seventh
circuit
below
was
exactly
the
law,
insofar
as
we
can
find
it.
now,
going
on,
they
told
the
court
below
that
work
preservation
wasn't
the
defense
and
i
am
contending
to
read
because
the
union's
refusal
to
handle
the
doors
was
unlawful.
and
"its
sudden
law
that
if
an
object
of
union's
activity
is
unlawful,
other
lawful
activities
do
not
insulate
its
conduct
from
the
reach
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b)".
and
so
concluding
this
first
110
point,
we
submit
your
honors
that
the
boycott
of
prefab
doors
on
the
frouge
job
violated
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
just
as
the
boycotts
on
the
other
three
jobs.
there's
no
valid
difference.
now,
the
second
case
number
111
is
covered
by
our
brief
and
that
case
of
course
and
our
reference
it'll
be
to
it.
here,
we
contend
the
rule
17
violated
8
(e)
as
found
by
the
court
below.
now
i'd
like
to
first
take
a
quick
look
at
this
rule
17
itself
again.
our
111
brief,
you'll
find
it
at
the
bottom
of
page
4.
the
core
of
this
rule,
no
member
will
handle
material
coming
from
a
mill
where
prefabrication
has
been
done.
now,
what
mill?
any
mill
in
the
united
states
your
honors
that
sought
to
make
and
sell
and
to
distribute
prefabricated
doors
in
philadelphia.
the
admitted
purpose
of
rule
17
was
to
close
philadelphia
to
these
thousands
of
prefabricated
doors
that
had
been
flowing
into
the
area.
now,
there's
no
real
dispute
to
that.
union
manager
gray
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
that
you
would
have
--
would
have
to
your
honor,
decide
the
meaning
of
the
words
"will
not
use
prefabricated
doors."
now,
whether
in
arriving
at
that
meaning,
you
took
into
consideration
the
effect,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
that
whether
you
have
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
now
we
have
just
finished
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
point.
if
we
--
if
there
was
a
strike
to
enforce
that
and
the
effect
of
it
was
that
the
doors
were
not
used
you'd
have
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
boycott.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
we'll
i'm
--
we'll
come
to
that
on
that
point.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
it
would
be
precisely
the
same,
and
an
illustration
is
the
rule
in
the
joliet
contractor's
case
which
was
phrased
the
other
way.
it
was
all
glazing
will
be
done
on
the
glass
jobsite.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes
it
would,
because
your
honor,
for
whatever
the
man's
doing
at
the
local
job,
the
effect
of
it
has
an
embargo
impact
of
breaking
off
relations
between
them
and
others.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
the
fibreboard
case
forts
--
if
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
the
fibreboard
case
involved
if
the
court
please,
the
bargaining
case.
whether
it
was
bargaining,
collect
--
or
mandatory
subject
to
bargaining
on
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
no.
let's
assume
that
that
has
the
effect
of
--
of
establishing
a
--
a
legal
position.
that
had
to
do
with
the
subcontracting
of
work
--
in
of
maintenance
work
in
the
physical
confines
of
a
plant.
now,
we
take
the
position
your
honor
that
whatever
may
be
the
situation
under
8
(e)
of
the
subcontracting
of
work
propositions
that
when
you
have
a
boycott
of
a
product,
of
a
product
that's
made
elsewhere
you
have
a
different
condition.
and
we
hope
to
be
able
to
satisfy
the
court
of
that.
now,
coming
with
this
8
(e),
there's
no
dispute
that
this
was
employed
to
keep
doors
out
of
philadelphia.
manager
gray
said
that
rule
of
prohibited
doors
and
that
contractors
who
use
the
doors
were
breaching
our
agreement.
and
that
he
intended
to
prevent
the
use
of
such
doors
by
enforcement
of
rule
17
throughout
his
jurisdictional
area.
now,
i'd
like
to
consider
the
application
of
8
(e)
to
this
rule.
section
8
(e)
prohibits
employers
and
the
union
from
handling
the
products
of
any
other
employer.
in
other
words,
it
expressly
applies
to
8
(e).
and
the
board
concedes
this,
i
think
at
page
111
--
in
its
brief
at
111
at
page
11.
that
the
language
of
8
(e)
expressly
covers
rule
(e).
so
what's
the
problem
here?
there
was
--
that
the
court
below
found
no
problem.
but
i
submit
that
the
problem
is,
that
the
board
has
engrafted
on
8
(e),
an
administratively
devised
exemption
for
primary
work
preservation
agreements.
now,
we
think
the
board
is
wrong.
by
its
fixation
on
work
preservation,
the
board
has
disregarded
the
specific
prohibition
of
agreements
to
boycott
the
products
of
others
which
is
written
in
the
8
(e).
now,
these
agreements
have
dual
objectives,
the
work
preservations
are
probably
but
certainly,
the
objective
of
boycotting
products
of
other
people.
now,
i
think
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
board
is
reverting
to
the
hutcheson
case
concept
that
union
self-interest
excuses
product
boycotts.
but
as
we've
seen,
congress
intended
taft-hartley
to
change
that
situation
and
there's
no
certain
that
congress
had
the
same
intention
when
it
enacted
8
(e)
in
1955.
now,
the
board
tries
to
justify
as
departure
from
the
strict
language
of
the
act
by
saying
that
it
can't
be
interpreted
literally
because
that
would
ban
all
primary
strikes.
although
we
submit
that's
not
a
relevant
argument
here.
it's
true
as
the
court
explains
in
rice
milling,
that
this
does
not
ban
primary
strikes
and
so
forth.because
the
picket
line
interference
is
incidental.
but
here,
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
apply
literally,
doesn't
give
the
board
free
reign
to
depart
from
the
act
in
other
situations
and
write
in
its
own
limitations.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
agree
your
honor.
i
agree
that
they
should
be.
and
just
the
question
which
--
which
tail
wag,
which
dog
i
think.
now,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
denver,
the
key
in
these
cases
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
union's
real
objection.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
this
distinction,
in
the
conventional
strike,
the
--
the
working
conditions
and
recognition
and
the
like.
the
boycott
of
other
people
is
not
the
objective
of
the
union.
the
interference
with
others
is
only
incidental
to
the
basic
strike.
but
when
the
boycott
of
other
people
becomes
a
subject
of
the
strike,
the
boycott
is
not
incidental
but
certainly
is
the
and
at
least
an
object
of
the
strike.
the
struck
employer
is
powerless
to
grant
the
union's
demand
except
by
boycotting
and
discontinuing
the
handling
of
the
products
of
other
people
and
in
philadelphia
here
for
instance.
these
contractors
could
not
comply
with
rule
17,
except
by
boycotting
the
products
of
our
charging
parties
in
this
case.
now,
the
answer
of
course
is
what
congress
intended
and
the
legislative
history
on
8
(e)
is
an
important
factor
here.
we
submit
that
the
congressional
intent
on
the
phase
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
that
8
(e)
was
intended
to
outlaw
boycott
rules
just
like
17.
now,
of
course
8
(e)
was
intended
to
complement
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
this
court's
decision
in
sand
door
pointed
out
that
a
boycott
agreement
although
not
a
defense,
although
a
--
a
defense
in
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
case
was
lawful
in
itself.
now,
the
congress
faced
with
this
decision,
concluded
that
agreements
to
boycott
like
consummated
boycotts
should
be
outlawed
as
against
public
policy
and
they
did
so.
now,
the
legislative
history
has
reviewed
in
our
brief
at
pages
19
to
35,
on
the
brief
of
the
associate
general
contractors
50
to
59.
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
only
a
few
significant
features
of
it.
first,
the
board's
contention
that
the
legislative
references
to
teamsters
'hot
cargo'
agreements,
evidences
an
intent
to
exclude
other
forms
of
boycott
agreements,
just
was
wrong.
now,
here's
what
happened.
the
original
kennedy-ives
bill,
which
was
introduced
in
january
1959,
contained
only
labor
reform.
the
taft-hartley
proponents
wanted
to
get
in
amendments.
now,
to
get
on
to
this
reformed
legislative
bandwagon
so
to
speak,
they
had
to
have
our
whipping
boy
and
they
picked
out
the
teamsters
union
on
'hot
cargo'.
and
they
succeeded
in
the
senate
in
getting
an
amendment
which
may
ban
boycott
agreements
in
the
transportation
industry
and
they
tried
to
expand
that
there
but
they
failed.
in
the
house,
however,
they
broadened
this
to
include
a
prohibition
against
agreements
to
boycott
by
all
employers.
and
the
after
the
conference
accept
this
as
the
breadth,
breadth
of
this
new
provision,
senator
kennedy
himself
explained
it
as
follows
and
i
refer
to
our
brief
111
of
page
28.
the
landrum-griffin
bill
extended
the
'hot
cargo'
provisions
of
the
senate
bill
which
we
applied
only
the
teamsters
to
all
agreements
between
an
employer
and
the
labor
union
by
which
the
employer
agrees
not
to
do
business
with
another
concerned.
so
after
broadening,
'hot
cargo'
became
synonymous
with
an
agreement
to
boycott
the
products
of
other
employers.
now,
the
second
feature
of
the
act,
of
the
legislative
history,
from
january
28
until
september
3rd,
every
admin
--
every
landrum-griffin
bill
that
was
introduced
and
there
were
lot
of
them,
contained
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
itself,
a
proscription
against
an
agreement
to
boycott.
in
other
words,
it
necessarily
had
to
be
as
broad
as
the
section
itself.
now,
this
provision
was
dropped
from
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
conference
september
3rd.
only
after
the
conferees
were
satisfied
and
said,
they
were
satisfied
that
8
(e)
was
as
broad
as
the
8
(b)
provision
had
been,
and
we've
covered
this
at
page
25
on
our
brief.
now
third,
all
of
the
opponents
of
8
(e)
in
the
congress,
clearly
understood
the
broad
sweep
of
the
section
and
reportedly
said
so,
our
brief
at
27
to
30.
now,
after
pleading
for
the
same
justifiable
boycotts
as
they
had
in
1947,
they
accepted
the
broad
scope
of
8
(e)
with
only
two
exceptions.
the
limited
one
for
the
construction
industry
i
referred
to
and
the
broad
one
for
the
apparel
industry.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
worked
at
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
that
is
a
--
a
possibility
if
you
wanted
to
view
it
that
way,
except
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
that's
possibly
true.
viewing
it
--
viewing
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct,
that's
what
they're
arguing
here.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
right.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
your
honor
is
exactly
correct
and
even
more
than
that,
this
proviso
as
you
say
points
out
for
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
construction.
senator
kennedy
himself
wrote
the
proviso,
pointed
out
if
the
proviso
does
not
cover
boycotts
of
goods
manufactured
in
an
industrial
plant
for
installation
at
the
jobsite
or
suppliers
who
do
not
work
at
the
jobsite.
now,
there
were
repeated
references
to
the
reason
for
that
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
meticulous
care
with
which
the
proponents
pointed
out
that
products
made
offsite
were
not
within
the
proviso
demonstrates
their
belief,
the
section
8
(e)
--
(8)
(e)
itself
covered
such,
otherwise
there
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
would
have
been
meaningless.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
sir?
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that
section
8
(e)
itself
covers
or
bar
such,
otherwise
there'd
be
no
meaning
to
the
point
that
the
prefabricated
--
the
proviso
did
not
cover
the
offsite
products.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
would
excuse
--
a
large
extent
your
honor.
in
this
respect,
just
as
congress
did.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well,
let's
--
the
basic
thing
is,
what
did
the
man
boycotted
the
product
intent,
and
what
did
he
do?
now,
if
the
intention
is
to
bar
products
made
offsite,
at
least
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
do
you
have
illegality?
now,
whether
there
are
additional
illegalities
with
reference
to
restraints
on
subcontract
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
well
and
--
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
insofar
as
the
proviso
application
occurs,
it
is
expressly
by
statute
limited
to
onsite
situations.
but
the
question
i
think
you're
asking
is
this
and
my
--
that
can
the
contractor
and
the
union,
with
the
purest
of
motives,
work
preservation
law
of
everything
else
make
a
boycott
agreement
that
products
manufactured
by
other
people,
away
from
there
can't
be
used
in
this
area,
i
say
violates
8
(e).
now
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes
i
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
appreciate
your
question
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
think
so.
and
so
far
as
the
embargo
aspect
of
this
sort
of
agreement
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
is
concerned,
such
as
you
had
in
allen
bradley.
i
can't
conceive
for
instance
your
honor
that
an
agreement
barring
the
products
that
were
held
illegal
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
or
would
have
been
under
allen
bradley
situation,
would
be
legal
under
8
(e)
and
joliet
contractors,
the
agreement
not
to
permit
pre-glazed
doors
to
come
in
to
chicago.
now,
i
am
going
to
pass
the
thing
which
i
think
we've
discussed
that
these
cases
must
be
--
these
statutes
must
be
construed
to
me
in
the
same
thing,
they
are
close
in
pari
materia,
and
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
that
the
argument
which
tail
wags,
which
dog
possibly,
is
my
position
that
my
dog
was
there
forced
and
the
tail
was
tucked
on
to
it.
now,
the
board
cites
a
number
of
work
assignment
cases
of
subcontracting
cases
which
i
can
only
touch
here
because
of
the
time
situation.
it's
our
view
that
these
subcontracting
cases
which
have
to
do
with
who
will
do
work
in
these
local
jurisdictional
situations,
involved
special
problems
such
as
common
situs
problems,
such
as
this
court
had
in
the
general
electric
case
of
the
common
--
the
extra
gain
and
all
of
that.
and
whatever
may
be
the
eventual
law
on
these
subcontracting
cases
and
the
writers
are
still
debating
how
that's
going
to
come
out.
we
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
an
agreement
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
alright,
fine.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
make
the
same
argument
because
of
the
embargo
pact
--
impact
on
products
manufactured
by
other
people.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly.
yes.
now,
we
just
--
we
distinguished
these
work
assignment
cases,
we
hope
the
subcontracting
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
we
have
here
a
product
embargo
and
not
a
work
assignment.
because,
we
contend
that
it's
one
thing
to
divide
up
the
work
after
products
have
come
to
a
job
or
an
area,
as
to
which
union
is
going
to
put
on
this
or
that.
it's
another
thing
to
draw
a
line
around
that
place
and
say
what
products
can
come
there
to
the
first
instance.
in
the
one
case,
your
subcontracting
work,
in
the
other
case
you're
embargoing
products
which
we
think
is
outside
the
scope
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
no,
i
would
--
your
honors,
how
this
subcontracting
thing
is
going
to
come
out,
i
don't
know.
i
would
say
that
the
fibreboard's
impact
certainly
is
relate
--
first,
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
it
was
limited
to
the
specific
type
of
subcontracts
there
involved.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
happened
to
be
a
maintenance
one,
but
it
has
broader
scope
in
that.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
and
the
work
you
were
talking
about
in
any
event
your
honor
was
going
to
be
done
on
the
premises.
it
was
not
dealing
with
work
that
would
be
done
elsewhere
in
wisconsin
instead
of
philadelphia.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
the
basis
of
our
distinction.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
so
that
has
to
be
a
line
some
place.
if
someone
is
subcontracting
cases
are
going
to
be
found
labeled,
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere
between
them
and
the
product
boycott
situation,
where
that
line
is
going
to
be,
i
don't
know.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that
would
be
violative
of
8
(e)
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
in
the
same
manner
as
a
like
agreement
with
another
employer
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
it
does,
unless
you
make
a
distinction.
i
think
it
does
unless
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
localized
nature
of
work
on
a
premises,
the
same
thing
you
get
involved
any
of
your
common
situs
cases
and
something
that
has
an
embargo
effect
reaching
out
and
disturbing
the
products
that
can
move
in
the
channels
of
distribution.
and
--
we
say
the
rest
of
distinction
between
these
localized
situations
how
you
divide
up
work,
and
one
which
draws
a
line
around
a
thing
and
keeps
these
products
out.
now,
and
i
think
it
couldn't
be
better
said
if
the
court
please,
than
in
the
first
joliet
contractor's
case.
at
page
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
joliet
contractors.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
the
case
in
51.
the
board
reasoning
ignores
the
fact
that
the
real
effect
of
a
secondary
boycott
in
the
building
and
construction
industry
is
the
stoppage
of
the
flow
of
building
materials
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
dealer
and
to
the
contractor.
and
it's
that
curtain
effect
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
embargo
thing.
now
in
conclusion,
we
want
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
briefs
of
the
amici
here
and
explain
that
we
agree
with
them
as
to
the
very
serious
economic
effects
on
the
public
interest
if
these
boycott
immunities,
these
whole
city
boycotts
are
going
to
be
permitted
to
continue
in
this
country.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
thank
you
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
your
honor
has
a
point,
i
do
not.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
few
minutes,
i
have
left,
if
the
court
please
i'd
like
to
stress
just
two
points.
first,
to
the
control
point
to
which
mr.
manoli
has
just
addressed
himself
and
second
to
this
primary
and
secondary
dichotomy
which
the
board
presses
when
it
suits
a
purpose
and
disregards
when
it
doesn't.
now
first,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
we
must
remember
that
in
this
case,
this
union
boycott
on
all
four
jobs
prevented
the
use
of
prefabricated
doors
and
rule
17
prevented
the
use
of
prefabricated
doors
in
philadelphia.
now
let's
look
at
this
control
theory.
i
don't
know
what
the
board
means.
it
changes
its
view
on
it
but
at
best,
a
control
is
an
evidentiary
guide
where
you
have
a
mixed
up
common-situs
situation
where
you
have
obscure
objectives.
at
best
that's
it.
now
it
serves
no
purpose
where
you
have
a
clear
cut
objective
anymore
than
any
other
presumption
of
evidence,
where
you
have
a
clear
cut
evidence
of
objective
against
boycott
doors
which
you
have
here.
now,
i
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
if
--
you
honor,
i'm
glad
you
ask
that.
in
this
case
there
is
no
neutral
employer.
there's
always
a
fight
between
the
union
and
the
local
contractor
about
prefabric
--
about
using
somebody
else's
doors.
there's
a
three-way
fight.
there
is
no
neutral.
this
talk
about
neutral
employers
just
doesn't
fit
here.
now,
on
the
control
theory,
let's
apply
it
below.
whatever
trust
control
had,
where
did
it
point?
it
pointed
only
to
the
con
--
project
owner
on
the
three
jobs
where
the
doors
were
specified.
not
elsewhere.
that's
the
only
place
it
could
point,
whatever
thrust
it
had.
but
what
did
the
board
claim?
that
the
objective
was
not
only
the
owners
but
the
manufacturers
and
the
distributors
of
the
door,
there
it
saw
irrespective
of
controller
on
the
three
jobs
where
violations
were
found.
there
was
found
a
boycott
objective
against
doors
and
the
manufacturers.
and
so
with
frouge,
it
was
identically
the
same.
whatever
trust
control
had
pointing
at
frouge,
was
purely
incidental
because
on
that
case
the
boycott
objective
was
precisely
the
same.
it
was
against
the
prefabricated
doors.
now,
i
want
to
hit
this
next
point
on
this
primary,
secondary
formula.
if
the
court
please,
a
reading
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
you're
right
your
honor,
nothing
on
this
primary
secondary
business.
in
the
first
place,
if
a
reading
in
the
board's
case
reveals
that
this
formula
is
applied
in
about
a
third
of
their
cases
and
the
court
cases
in
the
sense
of
a
one-two-three
dispute,
it
doesn't
work
out
that
way.
now,
there
are
many
boycott
situations
that
involve
the
one-two-three
business.
but
many
product
boycotts
which
congress
intended
to
eliminate
clearly
do
not
involve
those
and
i
cite
allen
bradley.
and
if
the
court
please,
my
good
friend,
mr.
manoli
misquotes
this
case
completely
because
in
that
case,
the
union
was
not
concerned
with
nonunion
products
from
elsewhere
or
other
things.
it
barred
all
products
regardless
of
union
affiliations.
i
pointed
out,
it
barred
products
from
a
sister
--
local
over
in
jersey
city.
and
he
didn't
finish
the
quote
from
senator
taft.
he
said,
“we
will
not
permit
any
material".
this
is
--
he's
talking
about
the
bradley
case.
this
is
page
63
in
our
briefs.
we
will
not
permit
any
material
made
by
any
other
union
or
any
nonunion
worker
to
come
into
new
york
city
and
to
be
put
in
to
any
building
in
new
york.
they
just
can't
bring
it
in,
union
or
nonunion,
they
didn't
care.
the
principle
announced
by
the
senator
of
florida
would
make
that
stand
lawful
as
it
is
lawful
today.
of
course,
we
proposed
to
change
the
law
in
that
effect.
and
gentlemen,
the
impact
of
allen
bradley
in
congress
and
the
impact
in
the
cases
for
20
years
has
been
that
it
was
an
embargo
type
product
--
boycott.
now
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
sir
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
it
might
except
congress
has
already
considered
that
situation.
certainly,
the
union
has
the
right
and
the
employer
have
the
right
to
control
what
work
is
done
with
reference
to
things
which
come
to
the
jobsite.
the
proviso
expressly
provides
that.
but
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
the
point
of
it
is,
what
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
that's
correct.
they
can
divide
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
and
this
law
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
this
proviso,
if
the
court
please
was
directed
to
that.
it's
the
localized
situation,
a
mixed
up
thing
which
you
have
in
your
common-situs
in
other
case.
but
congress
looking
at
it
said,
and
senator
taft
said,
and
everybody
else
said,
this
proviso
does
not
apply
to
products
manufactured
at
the
job
--
away
from
the
factory
to
be
brought
in
here.
why?
because
the
freedom
they
were
giving,
these
restrictive
contracts
was
lo
--
limited
to
the
localized
situation.
and
in
the
general
miller
work,
if
the
court
please,
there
was
no
agreement
there
at
all.
there
was
a
debate
about
the
agreement.
and
there
was
a
debate
whether
it
had
a
union
label
clause
like
ours
here.
and
there
was
a
debate
about
whether
it
banned
on
pre-hanged
doors
but
the
crux
of
the
decision
and
the
reason
for
the
court's
decision,
i
presumed
to
suggest.
and
the
board's
decision
was
that
there
was
boycott
on
prefabricated
doors
and
the
justice's
recollection
that
is
absolutely
correct.
now,
on
--
so
much
for
this
primary
secondary
dispute
business,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
write
primary
secondary
and
secondary
boycotts
into
the
act,
it
could
readily
have
done
so.
and
in
the
1959
legislature,
every
bill
of
the
opponents
of
the
landrum-griffin
amendments
put
into
their
bill
a
primary
secondary
dichotomy,
which
the
board's
talking
about,
everyone
of
them,
the
elliott
bill
and
the
shelly
bill
and
the
roosevelt
bill.
and
congress
expressed
--
they
wrote
it
into
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
and
congress
expressly
rejected
that
bill
and
then
adopted
instead
the
landrum-griffin
bill
which
does
not
have
any
such
prescription.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
senator
pepper
was
arguing
the
same
principle
but
back
in
1947
in
connection
with
the
original
taft-hartley
amendments,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes,
and
he
--
in
that
connection
cited
the
quote
that
i
quoted
about
--
ago.
now,
with
reference
to
this
matter
of
work
preservation,
may
i
suggest
this;
the
government's
argument
here
that
work
preservation
as
a
sole
objective
is
academic
in
this
case.
the
argument
that
8
(e)
does
not
ban
sole
work
preservation
objectives
--
agreements
is
academic
here
because
rule
17
by
--
i
feel
any
realistic
appraisal
had
dual
objectives.
it
had
the
work
preservation
objective
but
your
honors,
the
most
obvious
objective
if
one
can
read
and
see
and
understand
what
the
court
and
the
board
said
is
that
another
objective
was
to
ban
prefabricated
doors
from
philadelphia.
and
that's
what
it
did,
4000
of
them.
and
they're
not
going
in
yet.
now,
that
being
the
case,
this
is
what
the
court
talked
about
in
denver
building
trades
case,
that
this
statute
contemplates
dual
objectives.
and
that
the
existence
of
the
lawful
objective
does
not
excuse
an
unlawful
objective.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i'm
so
glad
you
asked
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
because
that
provides
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
the
distinction
between
this
primary
strike
business
the
board
is
talking
about
and
a
real
proscribed
objective.
now,
the
propend
--
the
primary
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
oh,
no.
i
am
arguing
that
the
board
sees
only
primary
activity.
it's
--
it
looks
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
then
you
have
illegality
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
now
that
--
you
mean
the
primary
strike
proviso?
because
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
--
your
honor,
the
primary
strike
proviso
came
from
the
international
rice
milling
case.
and
it
said
that
a
primary
strike
in
picket
lines
at
that
strike
premises
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
again
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
oh!
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
alright.
on
the
face
of
the
proviso,
the
proviso
does
not
permit
the
act
to
apply
the
primary
strike.
and
that's
--
statutory
pur
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
strikes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
the
primary
strikes
or
picketing,
the
proviso,
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
one
you're
talking
about,
yes.
now
that
was
merely
to
make
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
huh?
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
there
was
a
strike
here.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
on
the
purpose
of
that
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
it
is
a
primary
strike
for
a
proscribed
objective.
now,
to
illustrate
the
international
rice
milling
situation
if
i
may
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
if
the
trucks
which
approached
that
kaplan
plant
which
was
struck
had
been
stopped
by
the
pickets
because
the
trucks
were
full
of
prefabricated
doors
manufactured
elsewhere
under
the
reasoning
of
that
case
and
the
other
three
decided
the
same
day,
i
am
sure
this
court
would
have
held
it
illegal.
but
their
dispute
was
not
because
of
that,
their
dispute
was
with
the
kaplan
mill
for
recognition
and
the
like.
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
i
say
that
would
have
been
a
valid
thing
but
it
isn't
necessary.
the
court
and
the
boards
for
instance,
your
honor
have
never
required
the
existence
of
a
primary
dispute
to
trigger
the
sanctions
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
exactly.
and
fibreboard,
your
honor,
if
you
come
down
to
it
and
read
it
on
its
limitations,
it
is
not
in
the
collision
course
with
a
violation
of
8
(e)
because
they're
in
different
ballparks.
if
you
read
fibreboard
as
limited
--
mr.
charles
b.
mahin
as
limit
--
i'm
sorry.
as
limited
by
your
opinion
and
the
restrictions
on
fibreboard,
it
had
to
do
with
subcontracting
on
the
site
and
it
did
not
reach
the
subject
of
the
boycott
of
prefabricated
products
coming
to
the
site.
and
the
parallel
with
the
proviso
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
same.
they
permitted
these
agreements
on
the
site
but
made
it
clear
that
the
8
(e)
proviso
did
not
validate
boycotts
of
fabricated
products
made
away
from
the
site.
and
the
parallel
is
the
same
and
the
distinction
of
fibreboard
is
the
same
as
the
proviso
in
8
(e),
if
the
court
please.
