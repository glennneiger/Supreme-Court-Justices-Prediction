mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
it
might
be
a
bit
helpful
if
i
supplemented
a
little
bit
mr.
mahin's
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
rule
17
of
which
it
speaks
in
case
there's
any
confusion
on
part
of
anyone,
it
is
part
of
an
agreement.
at
first
it
lost
it
sounds
like
some
union
rule
but
it's
really
a
part
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
group
of
contractors
in
the
metropolitan
new
york
or
metropolitan
philadelphia
area
which
--
who
are
represented
by
an
association,
an
agreement
between
them
and
the
district
council
which
is
at
fully
aid
with
the
carpenters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh!
it
is
a
union
rule
but
its
part
of
the
contract,
its
part
of
the
contract.
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
should
clarify
--
clarify
that.
now,
there
were
originally
in
this
case
that
were
involved
four
contractors
on
behalf
of
whom
charges
had
been
filed
or
who
are
interested
in
the
charges.
three
of
these
contractors
here
had
been
given
certain
jobs,
and
on
those
jobs,
their
specifications
called
for
pre-fitted
doors.
the
fourth
contractor
frouge,
he
was
great,
he
wasn't
required
under
his
specifications
to
use
only
pre-fitted
--
pre-fitted
doors.
now,
of
course
he
was
party
to
this
arrangement
of
this
rule
17.
now,
when
pre-fitted
doors
were
brought
to
these
various
contractors,
the
union
relying
upon
its
contract
provisions
directed
these
employees
who
work
for
these
four
contractors
here
not
to
install
those
doors.
charges
were
filed
alleging
that
the
agreement
or
shall
i
say
rule
17,
that
the
agreement
was
an
8
(e)
agreement
and
also
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
charges
--
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
charge
and
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
that
the
union
by
directing
the
member
--
the
employees
of
these
particular
contractors
not
to
handle
these
doors
at
engaging
conduct
to
obtain
or
to
enforce
an
8
(e)
agreement.
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
charge
was
that
the
union
by
engaging
in
that
kind
of
conduct
had
--
had
engaged
in
secondary
strike
activity
against
these
various
contractors
in
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
they
were.
now,
when
the
case
came
to
the
board,
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
was
lawful.
it
was
not
prohibited
by
8
(e)
and
of
course
the
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
probably
by
the
way
side.
now,
with
respect
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
board
found
that
with
respect
to
frouge
who
had
control
over
the
choice
of
doors
that
there
was
no
violation.
not
only
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
control
over
that
item,
but
in
view
of
all
the
other
surroundings
circumstances
to
the
case.
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
had
a
choice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
with
the
project
owners.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
your
honor,
it
was
boycotted
in
the
sense
and
i'll
come
to
that
later
on
in
the
argument
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
i
think
we
have
to
talk
--
we
have
--
we
have
to
answer
the
question,
why
the
boycott?
why
the
boycott,
if
we're
going
to
use
that
loose
word.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
probably
did
not
make
any
difference,
they
couldn't
sell
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
couldn't
sell
their
pre-fitted
doors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
but
the
element
of
control
plus
the
other
considerations
is
important
in
determining
whether
this
is
a
primary
or
secondary
agreement
and
as
i
shall
discuss
later
on
section
8
(e)
deals
only
with
secondary
agreements.
now,
to
just
round
out
the
story
a
little
bit
about
what
the
board
and
what
the
lower
court
did
here,
with
respect
to
the
three
other
contractors
who
under
the
specifications
were
required
to
use
the
pre-fitted
doors,
the
board
found
that
they
no
longer
had
control
of
the
situation.
the
--
the
use
of
the
doors,
the
kind
of
doors
that
were
going
to
be
use
that
was
a
choice
made
by
the
owners
of
the
project.
so
there
the
board
said,
because
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
was,
he
didn't
have
to
work
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
in
the
sense
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
have
the
work,
and
so
the
board
says
that
since
he
does
no
longer
has
the
work,
then
the
target
of
the
union's
action
is
really
the
project
owner,
to
compel
the
project
owner
in
order
to
change
the
specification.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
board
filed
that
that
was
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
free
--
under
his
agreement,
under
his
agreement
however,
he
was
required
to
save
the
work
of
fitting
these
doors
to
his
employee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
he
--
if
he
was
free
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
not
sure
that
i
fully
appreciate
that.
i
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
--
are
we
speaking
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
contract
provision
did
not
bar
him
from
bidding
upon
that
thought.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
he
had
a
certain
obligations
flowing
under
this
particular
rule
17
to
his
employees.
namely,
that
in
a
sense
--
if
i
may
use
the
word
that
he
would
not
subcontract
the
work
of
finishing
the
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
--
he
could
have
done
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that's
right.
there
was
nothing
in
17
that
prevented
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
when
the
case
came
to
the
court
below
--
when
the
case
came
to
the
court
below,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
board's
finding
that
this
agreement
was
not
in
violation
of
section
8
(e).
the
court
below
found
that
the
strike
pressure,
that
the
--
use
and
--
use
refusal
to
install
the
doors
for
frouge
that
that
was
permissible,
not
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
and
thirdly
--
thirdly,
the
board
found
--
or
the
court
rather,
the
court
agreed
with
the
board
--
it
--
it
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
union's
refusal
to
install
the
doors
for
the
contractors
who
were
--
were
under
obligation
to
use
the
pre-fitted
doors
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
that
part
of
the
case
is
not
here.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
only
part
of
the
case
we
have
is
the
8
(e)
agreement
and
the
incident
involving
frouge.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
i
will.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
holds
that
that
rule
17
is
a
work
preservation
primary
type
of
agreement.
and
that
8
(e)
is
directed
only
to
secondary
agreements,
agreements
that
in
effect
required
an
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
employer
who
is
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
or
who
is
favored
by
the
union
or
who
is
non-union,
and
that
this
was
not
that
kind
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
now,
the
central
question
in
the
case
of
course
is
what
kind
of
an
agreement
was
rule
17?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
the
board
says
that
the
final
proviso
of
8
(e)
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
because
this
agreement
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
does
not
fall
within
8
(e)
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
since
it
does
not
fall
within
8
(e)
at
all,
the
proviso
does
not
come
into
play.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
now,
they
say
mr.
--
if
this
agreement,
if
this
agreement
is
a
lawful
agreement,
it
necessarily
follows
and
it
seems
to
us
as
the
board
found,
that
the
union's
refusal
to
install
the
doors
at
the
frouge
--
at
the
frouge
project
was
not
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
mahin
and
i,
we
are
accord
or
shall
i
say
the
board
and
mr.
mahin
are
in
accord,
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
and
section
8
(e)
are
complementary
and
that
the
basic
thrust
in
the
reach
of
the
two
provisions
of
the
statute
is
the
sa
--
is
the
same.
we're
also
in
accord
that
section
8
(e)
read
literally
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
supposed
is
puzzled,
i'd
explain
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
haven't
given
a
word.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
mahin
and
i
were
--
were
also
in
agreement
that
if
you
construe
section
8
(e)
literally,
it
would
outlaw
the
rule
17
here
because
in
effect
the
rule
17
here
bars
this
employer
from
--
from
--
as
a
practical
matter
from
purchasing
door
or
pre-fitted
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
it
falls
within.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
literally
yes,
right.
now
our
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
now,
our
difference
is,
the
question
then
would
be
whether
what
part
of
the
proviso
--
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
control,
that's
quite
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
our
differences
here
of
course
stem
from
the
fact
that
we
view
the
basic
reach
and
thrust
of
the
two
provisions
differently
and
we
are
also
in
disagreement
as
to
the
character
of
the
agreement
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
now,
basically
mr.
mahin's
argument
it
seems
to
me
seems
to
come
down
to
this.
that
the
80th
congress
which
adopted
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
which
is
now
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
current
--
of
the
sta
--
of
the
statute.
at
the
80th
congress
here
prohibited
all
refusals,
all
employee
refusals
by
employee
to
handle
or
use
the
products
of
another
employer.
and
with
these
premises
of
foundation,
the
argument
concludes
that
the
86th
congress
in
1959
which
was
bent
on
foreclosing
loopholes
in
the
statute
certainly
does
not
intend
to
create
anything
were
non-existent
and
that
it
did
not
intend
to
permit
a
circumvention,
a
circumvention
of
the
prohibition
against
secondary
boycotts
by
agreements
which
would
require
an
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
or
to
refrain
from
using
these
projects.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
initially
to
the
argument.
the
argument
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
bans
all
employer
refusals
to
handle
the
products
of
another
employer
and
that
therefore,
when
the
union
directed
the
employees
of
frouge
not
to
handle
the
pre-fitted
doors
it
committed
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
the
weakness
of
the
argument,
the
weakness
of
the
argument
is
that
it
places
an
unwarranted
reliance
upon
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
an
approach
which
this
court
rejected
in
1951
in
the
international
rice
milling
and
rejected
again
in
general
electric
case
in
1961,
and
if
that
approach
were
to
be
followed,
it
would
mean
that
primary
strike
activity
which
necessarily
tends
to
disrupt
the
activity
--
they
have
been
to
these
relations
of
the
struck
employer
that
primary
struck
--
strike
activity
would
be
unlawful.
but
this
court
on
of
at
least
two
occasions
has
refused
to
countenance
that
kind
of
an
approach
of
the
statute
and
in
addition
to
that,
congress
in
1959
when
it
added
the
primary,
secondary
proviso
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
provision
of
the
act
unmistakably,
unmistakably
precluded
such
a
reading
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
now,
in
the
denver
building
case
which
has
won
the
first
cases
that
came
here
after
the
taft-hartley,
this
court
told
us
that
the
congressional
policy
which
is
embedded,
which
is
embedded
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
dual
congressional
policy
of
preserving
to
the
employees
the
right
to
exert
pressure
upon
in
offending
employer
and
to
be
involved
in
a
primary
dispute
and
of
shielding,
shielding
and
not
offending
employer
from
pressures
and
controversies
not
his
own.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
public
too
that's
right.
now,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
as
this
court
has
said
and
again
on
two
occasions
and
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
194
--
1947
amendments
unmistakably
indicates,
was
directed
on
what
it
is
called
the
secondary
boycott
again
in
the
language
of
this
court
who
sanctions
bear
not
upon
the
offending
employer
who
is
--
who
alone
is
involved
in
the
dispute
but
upon
some
third
party
who
has
no
concern.
the
practice
against
which
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
directed
as
the
conference
report
on
the
taft-hartley
amendments
makes
clear,
was
the
practice
of
a
union
calling
a
strike
or
engaging
in
a
work
stoppage
at
employer
a,
in
order
to
compel
employer
a
to
cease
doing
business
with
employer
b
who
is
either
non-union,
was
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
or
was
disfavored
for
some
other
reason
by
--
by
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
indicated
that
earlier
that
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
had
become
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
thought
perhaps
i
would
not
be
confused
if
i
use
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
having
indicated
that
that
really
is
the
same
at
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
talking
about
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
if
i
inadvertently
say
b,
what
i'm
talking
about
in
this
phase,
what
i
mean
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
now,
mr.
mahin
--
mr.
mahin
in
his
brief,
he
acknowledges
that
this
example
was
a
stock
example
that
was
used
by
the
proponents
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
as
the
ter
--
as
indicating,
demonstrating
the
scope
and
the
reach
of
that
provision.
now,
mr.
mahin
would
seek
to
persuade
us
however
that
these
illustrations
here,
that
these
examples
were
intended
to
be
merely
illustrative
and
not
intended
to
be
exclu
--
exclusive.
and
that
congress
meant
to
reach
what
he
calls
boycott
action,
even
though
--
even
though
such
action,
and
again
as
he
puts
it,
does
not
fit
into
the
stock
definition
of
a
secondary
boycott.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor,
just
one
--
one
sentence
and
i'll
be
through.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
i
think
that
in
connection
with
that
it
is
where
they're
called
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
sand
door
work
said,
congress'
purpose
was
more
narrowly
conceived,
it
aimed
to
restrict
the
area
of
industrial
conflict
insofar
as
this
could
be
achieved
by
prohibiting
the
most
obvious,
widespread
and
as
congress
evidently
judge
dangerous
practice
of
the
union
to
widen
that
conflict.
the
coercion
of
neutral
employers
themselves
not
concerned
with
their
primary
dispute
through
the
inducement
of
their
employees
to
engage
in
strikes
or
concerted
refusals
to
handle
goods.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
arose
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
addressing
myself
for
the
contention
of
the
other
side
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
barred
all
so-called
product
boycotts.
i
suggest
that
the
use
of
the
slogan,
product
boycotts,
does
not
help
--
really
help
us
resolve
our
problem.
when
congress
enacted
legislation
against
product
boycotts
it
had
in
mind
a
specific
evil
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
product
boycott.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
product.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
when
congress
congress
enacted
legislation
against
product
boycotts,
it
had
a
specific
evil
in
mind
namely
employer
refusals
to
handle
the
products
of
another
employer
who
was
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
or
who
was
nonunion
or
who
was
otherwise
disfavored,
otherwise
disfavored
by
the
union
representing
those
particular
employees.
and
that
this
was
a
device
to
exert
to
a
neutral
employer
pressure,
pressure
upon
the
employer
disfavored
by
the
union.
now
in
determining
whether
or
not
refusals
to
handle
products
coming
from
another
employer,
whether
that
was
refusals
are
a
violation
of
the
statutes
or
whether
or
not
we
must
look
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
of
congress,
we
must
look
to
the
objective
of
the
employees
or
the
union
that's
directing
them
to
refuse
to
handle
the
products
coming
from
another
employer.
now,
let
me
explain
my
meaning
with
two
illustrations.
supposed
for
example
that
you
have
my
--
employer
a,
employer
a
buys
doors
from
manufacturer
b.
the
employees
of
employer
a
are
union.
those
of
employer
b
are
nonunion.
the
employees
of
a
refuse
to
install
the
doors
coming
from
b
because
b's
doors
do
not
bear
the
union
label
and
b,
his
employees
are
nonunion.
that
was
the
situation
under
sand
door
case
which
was
before
this
court
several
years
ago.
now
let
me
give
a
second
illustration.
employer
a
under
his
contract
with
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
his
employees
is
required
and
has
traditionally
given
them
certain
work
to
be
done
on
doors,
the
finishing
of
unfinished
doors.
now
employer
a
decides
that
he
is
going
to
buy
finished
doors.
and
when
these
finished
doors
come
to
him,
his
employees
refused
to
install
those
doors.
the
reason
that
they
are
refusing
to
install
those
doors
is
because
the
employer
in
violation
of
his
agreement
not
to
assign
the
finishing
work
to
someone
else,
to
preserve
it
for
them
as
--
deprive
them
of
work
which
they
have
traditionally
been
performing
and
work
which
under
their
contract
they're
entitled
to.
now
essentially,
that
is
the
case
before
this
court
involving
the
employer
of
the
contract
to
frouge.
that
is
not
a
secondary
boycott
situation.
all
that
the
two,
the
two
examples
which
i've
given
can
be
loosely
called
as
product
boycotts.
as
product
boycotts,
there
are
differences
between
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry
i'm
having
trouble
with
that
word,
product
boycotts
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
either
they
might
giving
it
--
catching
it
or
something
wrong
with
my
voice.
i'm
speaking
of
the
product
boycotts.
as
i
said,
the
two
illustrations
which
i've
given
to
the
court,
they
are
enti
--
although
in
the
sense
they
can
be
said
to
involve
product
boycotts.
product
boycotts,
they
are
analytically
different
because
the
object
of
the
employees
who
are
refusing
to
handle
the
products
are
entirely
different.
and
the
difference
in
their
object
makes
for
wholly
different
results
under
the
statute
a
result
which
should
not
be
blurred
by
simply
imposing
upon
them
the
label,
product
boycott.
in
the
first
case
that
i
gave,
in
the
first
case
i
gave
where
the
employees
of
the
union
re
--
union
employer
a
refused
to
handle
the
doors
coming
from
a
nonunion
source,
there
the
employees
have
no
dispute
whether
own
employer
over
the
terms
or
conditions
of
their
employment.
their
dispute
is
with
the
manufacturer
b
who
is
nonunion.
and
his
doors
do
not
bear
a
union
label.
when
they
refuse
to
perform
services
for
employer
a,
their
own
employer,
and
install
these
doors,
they
are
seeking
to
exert
secondary
pressure
upon
b,
the
disfavored
employer.
that
was
i
said
was
a
situation
before
this
court
in
the
sand
door
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
stat
--
of
the
statute.
now,
in
the
second
example
which
i
gave,
which
should
i
say
is
essentially
the
case
before
this
court
involving
in.
and
in
the
frouge
incidence
--
in
the
frouge
incident,
in
the
second
case,
the
employees
of
employer
a,
they're
not
concerned
with
the
manufacture
of
the
doors
or
the
conditions
under
which
those
doors
are
manufactured.
their
concern
is
solely
with
res
--
solely
over
the
loss
of
their
work
which
they
have
traditionally
been
performing
for
their
employer
which
under
their
agreement,
he's
agreed
to
give
to
them.
their
dispute,
the
target
of
their
action
is
their
immediate
employer
over
their
own
immediate
work
opportunities.
that
is
not
a
secondary
boycott
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
that
is
the
reason
why
the
employees
of
a
are
refusing
to
handle
his
doors
then
it
would
be
a
secondary
boycott.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
(inaudible)
yes,
yes
it
is
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
that's
right.
now
the
statute
says
an
object
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
an
object
and
you
may
have
a
mixed
situation
such
as
the
one
that
your
honor
is
suggesting,
but
in
that
case
so,
if
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
are
refusing
to
handle
this
product
because
the
manufacturer
of
the
door
is
nonunion,
it
is
nonunion,
then
the
board
under
those
circumstances
would
find
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right,
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
to
which
company,
your
honor?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
one
that
--
who
wants
to
buy
that
or
the
one
that's
buying
the
doors?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
again
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
embargo
is
a
total
one
or
a
partial
one.
we
must
look
what
--
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
refusal
of
the
employees
of
employer
a
is
when
they
refused
to
handle
the
doors.
where
they
hand
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
maybe
the
consequence,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
really
the
test.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
does.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
justice
stewart,
yester
--
excuse
me.
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it's
not
difficult
to
do
because
frequently
you
will
have
the
union
a
stating
why
it's
refusing
to
handle
the
particular
products.
they
will
frequently
say
to
the
employer,
"we're
refusing
to
handle
these
products
because
b
is
nonunion.
he's
involved
in
the
labor
dispute
or
he's
got
--
or
his
doors
or
products
bear
the
label
of
some
rival
or
other
union".
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
your
honor,
let
me
get
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
that
control.
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
now
or
yesterday
got
on
the
slightly
different
wedge
of
plans.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if?
i
will.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will.
now,
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
doors
that
--
in
the
finished
doors
which
the
employees
of
the
various
contractor
were
refusing
to
install.
some
of
them
bore
no
union,
no
label
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
others
bore
the
label
of
this
particular
union
and
still
others
bore
the
label
of
some
other
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
if
the
other
--
if
the
supplier
of
the
doors,
if
his
people
are
unionized,
and
that
employers
or
the
purchaser
said,
"that
is
our
work.
that
is
our
work".
in
our
view
that
would
be
primary
dispute.
they're
not
concerned
with
the
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
you
have
to
see
what
the
purpose
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
purpose
of
the
union
is
to
preserve
work,
is
to
preserve
work
for
the
employees
of
the
immediate
employer
involved
there,
then
i
would
say
it
--
that
was
protected
activity.that
was
not
--
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
let
me
get
to
allen
bradley
now
your
honor
because
i'm
just
at
that
point.
the
other
side
of
course
has
placed
a
great
deal
of
reliance
upon
the
legislative
references
in
the
1947
debates
on
the
taft-hartley
amendments
--
on
the
legislative
references
for
the
allen
bradley
case.
to
begin
with,
i
think
we
should
note
that
congress
as
the
conference
report
makes
clear
as
the
remarks
of
senator
taft
make
clear
viewed
that
case
as
involving
a
simple
and
a
classic
secondary
boycott
namely
where
the
employees
of
one
employer
were
refusing
to
install
certain
electrical
equipment
because
it
came
from
another
employer
where
there
was
another
union.
where
there
was
another
union
which
represented
those
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
because
of
that.
that's
the
way
they
say
the
conference
report
viewed
that
case
and
that's
the
way
senator
taft
view
it.
but
now
let's
look
at
the
particular
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
i
believe
we
can
distinguish
it
from
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
in
that
case,
the
union
which
represented
the
employees
of
the
new
york
city
contractors,
electrical
contractors,
it
had
no
dispute,
there
was
no
dispute
between
them
--
between
the
union
and
the
new
york
city
contractors.
but
under
an
agreement
between
the
contractors
and
the
union,
the
union
directed
the
employees
of
the
contractors
not
to
install
electrical
equipment
to
--
which
came
from
outside
of
the
city
of
new
york.
now
the
union's
purpose
in
doing
this
was
to
create
a
sheltered
market
for
the
new
york
city
manufacturers.
new
york
manufacturers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
it
was
to
create
a
sheltered
market
for
the
(inaudible)
for
the
new
york
city
manufacturers
and
of
course
the
union
indirectly
hope
to
obtain
the
advantage
of
an
increasing
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
directly
or
indirectly
as
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
which
employees?
it
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
attempting
to
create
more
work
for
its
members
who
were
employed
by
the
new
york
city
manufacturers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
new
york
city
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not,
no
it
is
not
your
honor.
as
new
york
manufacturers,
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
creating
more
work
for
the
employees
of
the
new
york
city
contractors.
now,
in
our
case,
in
--
and
because
of
that
the
union
there
refused
to
permit
the
new
york
city
contractor's
employees
who
had
no
dispute
to
perform
--
to
install
certain
equipment.
and
its
objective
was
to
obtain
certain
advantages
somewhere
else,
in
the
new
york
city
manufacturers,
who
employed
its
members.
in
our
case,
unlike
that
one
here,
the
union
is
seeking
to
obtain
it
--
protect
the
work
opportunities
of
the
employees
who
are
immediately
involved
in
this
labor
dispute
and
who
are
refusing
to
install
the
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
have
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
they
have
a
collective
bargaining
contract
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
with
all
the
employees
there
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
the
fact
that
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
fact
that
its
employer
or
a
collection
of
five
with
respect
to
each
one
of
them,
you
have
a
work
preservation
object.
now,
as
they
say,
the
fact
that
the
result
as
you
were
say
--
asking
me
yesterday
mr.
justice,
that
the
end
result
may
be
the
--
end
result
may
be
the
same.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
test.
in
one
case,
if
the
target
maybe
the
other
fellow,
the
supplier
of
the
doors,
that's
bad
when
he
is
the
target.
in
the
other
case,
where
the
target
is
the
immediate
employer,
even
--
the
effect
that
it
may
have
upon
this
supplier
of
the
door
is
an
incidental,
it's
a
by-product
if
you
will.
it's
a
by-product
of
the
primary
labor
dispute
over
the
preservation
of
work
between
the
--
between
employer
a
and
his
employee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
course
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
--
you
would
take
a
case
of
a
primary
strike,
primary
picket.
secondary
--
neutral
employers
are
hit
when
they
come
up
to
that
line.
they're
turned
away.
they're
dissuaded
from
going
there
and
they're
hit
and
yet
that
effect
as
this
court
has
said
is
incidental
to
a
legitimate
primary
activity.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
talking
about
a
primary,
it's
a
strike
bound
plan.
and
the
neutral
drivers,
drivers
who
bring
in
supplies
for
that
particular
contract
they
come
down,
they're
turned
away.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they're
turned
away
and
there
may
even
be
violence
on
the
--
at
the
primary
picket
line
turning
these
people
away.
they're
being
hit.
and
yet
the
court
has
said
that
that's
merely
incidental
to
a
legitimate
primary
activities
and
its
law.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
let
me
give
an
example,
we
had
the
sound
shingle
case
some
years
ago
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there,
the
union
represented
the
employers
of
an
american
manufacturer
of
shingles
(inaudible)
american
manufacturer
of
shingle,
one
who
use
shingles.
that
particular
person
was
buying
shingles
from
a
canadian
manufacturer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
from
a
canadian
manufacturer
and
the
union
did
not
want
the
american
employer
to
buy
shingles
from
the
canadian
manufacturer.
the
reason
they
didn't
want
to
buy,
the
reason
they
didn't
want
them
(inaudible)
it
is
because
canadian
manufacturer
working
standards
were
lower
than
those
here
and
they
--
of
the
american
manufacturer
and
the
canadian
manufacturer
was
nonunion.
now,
in
that
case,
the
union's
object,
the
target
of
the
union's
action
was
the
canadian
manufacturer
because
he
was
disfavored.
he
was
disfavored
because
he
was
nonunion
and
its
working
conditions
were
not
the
same
as
those
of
the
union
within
this
country.
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
board
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
why
was
it
a
violation
of
the
statute?
it
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
because
the
union
had
no
dispute
with
the
american
manufacturer.
its
dispute
was
directed
to
the
canadian,
to
the
canadian
manufacturer.
now,
if
there
had
been
no
dispute
with
the
canadian
manufacturer
and
the
dispute
had
been
solely
with
the
american
manufacturer
over
the
preservation
of
work,
the
fact
that
that
would've
prevented
canadian
goods
from
coming
into
this
state
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
was
secondary
or
primary.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
fact
that
it
might
result
in
that.
that
it
might
result
in
shutting
out
certain
supplies
from
coming
across
state
lines
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
its
primary
or
secondary
activity
under
this
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
such
finding
here.
the
board
never
addressed
itself
to
the
problem
whether
it
was
to
bar
or
not
to
bar
interstate
--
out
of
state
goods
because
it's
irrelevant
i
suggest.
it's
irrelevant
i
suggest
to
the
question
of
whether
its
primary
or
secondary.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
so
far
as
i
know
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
your
own
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
those
circumstances
we
would
say
your
honor
that
the
act
or
refusal,
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
those
circumstances
we
would
say
that
the
refusal
of
employer
--
of
the
employers
of
employee
a
to
install
those
doors
in
order
to
protect
the
interest,
the
interest
of
people
in
some
other
unit,
that
this
was
secondary.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
they
can
only
do
it
to
protect
their
own
immediate
work
interest.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i've
admitted
that
your
honor
that
literally
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
indeed
you
do.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
yes.
reason
having
to
do
where
the
person
--
who
the
person
who
was
supplying
the
goods
and
if
i
may
just
make
a
brief
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
of
course
the
court
had
all
of
this
legislative
history
in
the
international
rice
milling
case
which
we
had
here
back
in
1951.
and
this
morning
i
picked
up
our
brief
in
that
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
allen
bradley?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
the
court
--
the
congress
mentioned
allen
bradley
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
as
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
was.
and
as
i
have
said
--
as
i've
said,
number
one,
con
--
senator
taft
and
the
conference
report
viewed
that
as
a
simple
classic
secondary
boycott
of
the
employers
belonging
to
union
a
refusing
to
handle
the
goods
coming
from
another
source
where
there
was
another
union
in
the
picture.
and
the
--
just
let
me
read,
i
won't
take
the
time
to
read
the
whole
quotation,
but
just
let
me
read
what
senator
taft
said
in
connection
with
8
(b)
(4),
of
the
original
amendment."
this
provision
makes
it
unlawful
to
resort
to
a
secondary
boycott
to
injure
the
business
of
a
third
person
who
was
wholly
unconcerned
in
the
disagreement
between
an
employer
and
his
employees".
then
it
goes
to
say,
"we've
heard
all
kinds
of
talk
that
there
are
good
secondary
boycotts
and
bad
secondary
boycotts".
but
the
emphasis
is
repeatedly
is
on
secondary
boycotts.
then
after
he
having
said
that,
he
says,
"take
a
case
in
which
the
employer
is
getting
along
perfectly
with
his
employees.
they
agree
on
wages.
wages
and
working
conditions
are
satisfactory
on
both
sides.
someone
else
says
to
those
employers,
we
want
you
to
strike
against
your
employer
because
he
happens
to
be
handling
some
product
which
we
do
not
like.
we
do
not
think
it
is
made
under
proper
conditions".
of
course
it
goes
on
to
say
if
that
were
encouraged,
it
wouldn't
create
all
kinds
of
problems.
and
finally
concludes,
"we
condemn
the
view
that
if
other
workers
do
not
like
the
way
some
employer
is
treating
is
treating
his
employees,
they
can
promote
strikes
in
any
other
plant
which
happens
to
be
handling
the
product
of
the
plant
whose
management
that
the
workers
do
not
like.
that's
the
gloss
of
course
that
is
imposed
upon
that
literal
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
is
replete.
in
fact
mr.
mahin
acknowledges
that
that
was
the
stock
illustration
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
a
(voice
overlap)
illustration
he
used
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
used
by
the
proponents
of
that
legislation
and
i
suggest
it
was
the
only,
it
was
an
excuse
--
it
was
the
only
type
to
say,
a
boycott
that
they
were
trying
to
reach.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor,
i
took
special
precautions
to
check
on
that
case
and
i
suggest
that
if
you
were
to
go
back
to
reading
your
own
opinion,
i
do
suggest
that
you
also
read
in
connection
with
it
the
board's
decision
because
--
where
there's
one
factor
that
is
not
clear
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
which
your
honor
wrote.
that
case,
it
was
precisely
the
sand
door
case
where
the
employees
of
employer
a
refused
to
handle
doors
or
sojme
material,
equipment,
product,
whatever
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
doors.
that
were
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
coming
from
another
source,
from
the
manufacturer
whose
employees
belong
to
some
other
union.
and
as
i
say
that
fact
is
noted
clearly
in
the
board's
decision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
were
prefabricated
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
the
reason
was
not
that.
the
reason
that
the
union
gave
--
the
reason
that
the
board
found
--
which
under
--
which
caused
the
union
to
take
the
action
it
did
is
not
because
they
were
prefabricated
but
because
they
bore
the
label
of
some
--
because
there
were
some
--
some
other
union
people
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
confess,
i
--
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
as
i
read
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
reading
the
case,
going
back
to
the
boards'
decision.
it
seemed
to
be
essentially
like
the
sand
door
situation
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
mr.
(inaudible)
tells
that
there
was
a
union
rule
involved
there
but
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sure
you'll
--
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
in
my
little
note
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
he
--
no,
no,
its
--
i
have
it
here
somewhere,
the
--
but
passing
over
that
he
is
responding
to
senator
pepper.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he's
responding
to
senator
pepper
because
senator
pepper
was
taking
the
position
that
certain
types
of
secondary
boycotts
were
alright
where
a
union
was
trying
to
preserve
organizational
benefits
or
bondages
or
gains
that
--
or
a
union
was
trying
to
engage
in
a
secondary
boycott
against
some
employer
whose
standards
or
conditions
of
employment
were
not
as
good
as
that.
the
union
thought
that
they
should
be.
senator
pepper
was
making
the
argument.
that
was
a
good
secondary
boycott
in
that
situation.
so
in
response
to
that
line
of
arguments
senator
taft
says
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i'm
reading
from
the
brief
of
the
other
side
in
number
110,
111,
and
it's
at
page
63.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
senator
taft,
i
should
say.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am
suggesting
--
it
helps
us
that
the
allen
bradley
case,
it
is
not
our
case
here.
in
our
case,
the
employees
of
the
contractor
frouge
we're
not
refusing
to
install
these
doors
because
the
manufacturer
of
the
doors
was
rep
--
his
employers
were
represented
by
some
other
union.
they
had
no
concern.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
were
not
con
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
we
are
simply
stating
a
fact
that
it
came
from
out
of
state.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
may
have
been
a
crucial
fact
in
deciding
the
antitrust
aspect
of
it
but
in
viewing
it
under
(inaudible),
i
think
he
was
simply
stating
the
fact
that
they
came
--
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
this
argument
whether
they
came
in
or
out
of
the
state.
because
the
union
there
as
he
saw
the
case
was
refusing
to
handle
the
products
of
another
employer
whose
people
were
represented
by
another
union.
now,
i
think
i
better
get
to
my
time
has
--
would
be
to
run
fast.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
address
myself
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
address
myself
to
that
question
and
i
think
i
know
what
may
be
troubling
the
court
there
because
there
seems
to
be
some
apparent
inconsistency
between
the
board
saying
in
the
case
of
frouge,
it
was
permissible
legitimate
primary
activity
but
in
the
case
of
the
other
employer
it
was
secondary.
now
let's
see
if
i
can
explain
that.
all
of
these
contractors
here
were
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
effect
of
which
was
to
bar
them
from
subcontracting
the
finishing
of
--
the
finishing
work
on
doors.
three
of
these
employers
--
three
of
these
contractors,
i'm
sorry,
i
moved
away
from
that.
three
of
these
contractors
here
who
are
parties
to
this
agreement
here,
they
ignored
their
agreement
and
the
accepted
specifications
from
the
project
owners
and
those
specifications
called
for
finished
doors.
the
fourth
contractor,
frouge,
the
fourth
contractor,
his
specifications
did
not
require
him
to
use
those
doors.
now
with
respect
with
to
the
three
employers
who
in
this
regard
of
their
own
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
whatever
obligations
they
may
have
owed
to
their
employees
under
that
agreement
in
disregard
of
that,
they
have
taken
as
i
say
a
contract
which
is
now
taking
the
work
out
of
their
hands,
and
of
course
their
employers
have
been
denied
of
certain
work.
now
in
that
case,
the
board
held
that
this
was
secondary
activity
because
the
control,
the
control
over
the
dispute
had
passed
from
those
contractors
to
the
project
owners.
that
in
that
particular
context
the
board
then
deemed
the
union's
refusal
to
install
the
doors
as
being
direct
at
least
impart,
that
had
been
directed
at
least
to
impart
to
neutral
employers
namely
the
project
owners.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
it
--
it's
sticky,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
i
should
take
comfort
out
of
the
fact
that
those
--
that
particular
part
of
the
--
the
face
of
the
board's
case
is
not
before
this
court.
now
to
what
is
before
this
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you
--
we
can't
disregard
it.
now
with
respect
to
frouge,
i
am
trying
to
just
round
out
the
answer
to
your
question.
with
respect
to
frouge,
frouge
again
he
was
--
had
some
--
an
obligation
to
his
employees
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
his
specifications
did
not
call
for
prefinished
doors,
therefore
their
resolution
to
the
dispute
was
what
--
it
--
lay
with
him.
and
he
is
the
target.
he
is
the
only
target
of
the
union's
action.
now,
let
me
go
on
if
i
may
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
is
incidental
to
the
primary
dispute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
it
could
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
might
get
fired.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
element
of
control
as
we
think
that
the
board
saw
this
is
simply
one
of
the
elements
that
indicates
who
is
the
primary
target
of
the
union's
refusal
or
work
stoppage?
now
in
this
particular
case,
these
employees
had
traditionally
been
performing
this
work.
they
had
an
agreement
with
their
employer
that
they
were
going
to
get
this
work.
and
at
the
point
where
the
dispute
came
to
a
head,
the
point
where
the
dispute
came
to
a
head,
frouge
alone
had
complete
control
over
the
resolution
of
that
dispute.
and
he
could
have
resolved
the
dispute.
he
could
have
settled
it.
and
therefore
because
of
all
of
these
factors,
all
of
these
factors,
he
is
the
sole
and
primary
target
of
the
union's
action.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
was
a
work
preservation
agreement
and
that
the
employers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
i
have
only
apparently
four-five
minutes
and
i
want
to
get
into
the
section
8
(e)
aspect
of
the
case.
the
argument
of
course
here
is
being
made
that
the
agreement
here
between
the
contractors
and
their
employees
which
barred
the
use
of
these
prefinished
doors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
agreement
generally,
the
court,
lower
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
found
was
bad,
was
valid
--
in
violation
of
8
(e).
now
the
--
section
8
(e)
does
not
have
in
specific
terms
the
primary
--
secondary
provision
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
and
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(e)
with
the
construction
in
the
proviso,
whatever
significance
maybe
and
i'll
try
to
come
to
that
before
the
end
of
my
time.
with
that
to
one
side,
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(e)
would
appear
to
make
this
particular
agreement
unlawful
because
the
agreement
in
effect
permits
the
signatory
employer
to
refrain
from
buying
finished
doors
from
some
other
employer.
but
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
i
again
suggest
is
not
the
end
of
our
inquiry.
i
don't
think
we
needed
to
subscribe
to
the
proposition
that
the
surest
way
to
misread
the
statute
is
to
read
it
literally.
but
is
a
notorious
fact
that
the
1959
amendments
to
this
act
were
far
from
models
of
legislative
clarity.
and
section
8
(e)
is
unusually
deceptive.
it
is
unusually
deceptive
and
we
can
only
understand
it.
we
can
really
only
appreciate
the
true
meaning
of
that
language
only
in
the
like
of
it's
ever
--
of
its
genesis
and
its
legislative
evolution.
now
section
8
(e),
the
language
of
section
8
(e)
tracks
the
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
or
now
presently
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
the
current
statute.
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
reorient
the
thrust
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
boycotts
or
to
redefine
them.
as
one
commentator
has
set,
the
legislative
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
congress'
primary
concern
was
with
a
hot
cargo
clause
and
in
the
utility.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i'll
never
be
able
to
finish
it.
in
their
utility
for
circumventing,
the
then
existing
ban
against
secondary
pressures,
and
i'll
have
to
telescope
this.
the
evidence
that
--
the
legislative
evidence
i
think
unquestionably
demonstrates
that
the
overriding
concern
and
the
preoccupation
of
the
congress
when
it
enacted
section
8
(e)
was
with
hot
cargo
clauses.
clauses
which
would
bar
an
employer
from
doing
business
with
another
employer
involved
in
a
dispute
or
nonunion
or
otherwise
disfavored.
and
that
was
the
sole
purpose
of
the
--
of
section
8
(e)
was
to
deal
with
those
clauses
which
were
repeatedly
defined
along
the
lines
that
i
have
suggested.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
wish
i
had
more
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
case
of
the
three
contractors
who
with
accepted
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
specifications
calling
for
the
finished
doors,
the
board
found
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
between
all
of
the
contractors
and
the
union
was
valid
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
under
the
work
preservation
agreement
under
8
(e).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
--
yes,
that's
my
collection.
they
dismissed
the
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
the
board
has
said
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
cardinal
case
--
in
our
case
here,
the
board
separated
the
8
(e)
agree
--
the
agreement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
it
might
be
a
bit
helpful
if
i
supplemented
a
little
bit
mr.
mahin's
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
rule
17
of
which
it
speaks
in
case
there's
any
confusion
on
part
of
anyone,
it
is
part
of
an
agreement.
at
first
it
lost
it
sounds
like
some
union
rule
but
it's
really
a
part
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
group
of
contractors
in
the
metropolitan
new
york
or
metropolitan
philadelphia
area
which
--
who
are
represented
by
an
association,
an
agreement
between
them
and
the
district
council
which
is
at
fully
aid
with
the
carpenters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh!
it
is
a
union
rule
but
its
part
of
the
contract,
its
part
of
the
contract.
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
should
clarify
--
clarify
that.
now,
there
were
originally
in
this
case
that
were
involved
four
contractors
on
behalf
of
whom
charges
had
been
filed
or
who
are
interested
in
the
charges.
three
of
these
contractors
here
had
been
given
certain
jobs,
and
on
those
jobs,
their
specifications
called
for
pre-fitted
doors.
the
fourth
contractor
frouge,
he
was
great,
he
wasn't
required
under
his
specifications
to
use
only
pre-fitted
--
pre-fitted
doors.
now,
of
course
he
was
party
to
this
arrangement
of
this
rule
17.
now,
when
pre-fitted
doors
were
brought
to
these
various
contractors,
the
union
relying
upon
its
contract
provisions
directed
these
employees
who
work
for
these
four
contractors
here
not
to
install
those
doors.
charges
were
filed
alleging
that
the
agreement
or
shall
i
say
rule
17,
that
the
agreement
was
an
8
(e)
agreement
and
also
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
charges
--
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
charge
and
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
that
the
union
by
directing
the
member
--
the
employees
of
these
particular
contractors
not
to
handle
these
doors
at
engaging
conduct
to
obtain
or
to
enforce
an
8
(e)
agreement.
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
charge
was
that
the
union
by
engaging
in
that
kind
of
conduct
had
--
had
engaged
in
secondary
strike
activity
against
these
various
contractors
in
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
they
were.
now,
when
the
case
came
to
the
board,
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
was
lawful.
it
was
not
prohibited
by
8
(e)
and
of
course
the
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
probably
by
the
way
side.
now,
with
respect
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
board
found
that
with
respect
to
frouge
who
had
control
over
the
choice
of
doors
that
there
was
no
violation.
not
only
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
control
over
that
item,
but
in
view
of
all
the
other
surroundings
circumstances
to
the
case.
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
had
a
choice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
with
the
project
owners.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
your
honor,
it
was
boycotted
in
the
sense
and
i'll
come
to
that
later
on
in
the
argument
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
i
think
we
have
to
talk
--
we
have
--
we
have
to
answer
the
question,
why
the
boycott?
why
the
boycott,
if
we're
going
to
use
that
loose
word.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
probably
did
not
make
any
difference,
they
couldn't
sell
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
couldn't
sell
their
pre-fitted
doors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
but
the
element
of
control
plus
the
other
considerations
is
important
in
determining
whether
this
is
a
primary
or
secondary
agreement
and
as
i
shall
discuss
later
on
section
8
(e)
deals
only
with
secondary
agreements.
now,
to
just
round
out
the
story
a
little
bit
about
what
the
board
and
what
the
lower
court
did
here,
with
respect
to
the
three
other
contractors
who
under
the
specifications
were
required
to
use
the
pre-fitted
doors,
the
board
found
that
they
no
longer
had
control
of
the
situation.
the
--
the
use
of
the
doors,
the
kind
of
doors
that
were
going
to
be
use
that
was
a
choice
made
by
the
owners
of
the
project.
so
there
the
board
said,
because
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
was,
he
didn't
have
to
work
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
in
the
sense
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
have
the
work,
and
so
the
board
says
that
since
he
does
no
longer
has
the
work,
then
the
target
of
the
union's
action
is
really
the
project
owner,
to
compel
the
project
owner
in
order
to
change
the
specification.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
board
filed
that
that
was
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
free
--
under
his
agreement,
under
his
agreement
however,
he
was
required
to
save
the
work
of
fitting
these
doors
to
his
employee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
he
--
if
he
was
free
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
not
sure
that
i
fully
appreciate
that.
i
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
--
are
we
speaking
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
contract
provision
did
not
bar
him
from
bidding
upon
that
thought.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
he
had
a
certain
obligations
flowing
under
this
particular
rule
17
to
his
employees.
namely,
that
in
a
sense
--
if
i
may
use
the
word
that
he
would
not
subcontract
the
work
of
finishing
the
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
--
he
could
have
done
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that's
right.
there
was
nothing
in
17
that
prevented
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
when
the
case
came
to
the
court
below
--
when
the
case
came
to
the
court
below,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
board's
finding
that
this
agreement
was
not
in
violation
of
section
8
(e).
the
court
below
found
that
the
strike
pressure,
that
the
--
use
and
--
use
refusal
to
install
the
doors
for
frouge
that
that
was
permissible,
not
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
and
thirdly
--
thirdly,
the
board
found
--
or
the
court
rather,
the
court
agreed
with
the
board
--
it
--
it
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
union's
refusal
to
install
the
doors
for
the
contractors
who
were
--
were
under
obligation
to
use
the
pre-fitted
doors
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
that
part
of
the
case
is
not
here.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
only
part
of
the
case
we
have
is
the
8
(e)
agreement
and
the
incident
involving
frouge.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
i
will.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
holds
that
that
rule
17
is
a
work
preservation
primary
type
of
agreement.
and
that
8
(e)
is
directed
only
to
secondary
agreements,
agreements
that
in
effect
required
an
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
employer
who
is
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
or
who
is
favored
by
the
union
or
who
is
non-union,
and
that
this
was
not
that
kind
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
now,
the
central
question
in
the
case
of
course
is
what
kind
of
an
agreement
was
rule
17?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
the
board
says
that
the
final
proviso
of
8
(e)
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
because
this
agreement
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
does
not
fall
within
8
(e)
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
since
it
does
not
fall
within
8
(e)
at
all,
the
proviso
does
not
come
into
play.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
now,
they
say
mr.
--
if
this
agreement,
if
this
agreement
is
a
lawful
agreement,
it
necessarily
follows
and
it
seems
to
us
as
the
board
found,
that
the
union's
refusal
to
install
the
doors
at
the
frouge
--
at
the
frouge
project
was
not
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
mahin
and
i,
we
are
accord
or
shall
i
say
the
board
and
mr.
mahin
are
in
accord,
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
and
section
8
(e)
are
complementary
and
that
the
basic
thrust
in
the
reach
of
the
two
provisions
of
the
statute
is
the
sa
--
is
the
same.
we're
also
in
accord
that
section
8
(e)
read
literally
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
supposed
is
puzzled,
i'd
explain
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
haven't
given
a
word.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
mahin
and
i
were
--
were
also
in
agreement
that
if
you
construe
section
8
(e)
literally,
it
would
outlaw
the
rule
17
here
because
in
effect
the
rule
17
here
bars
this
employer
from
--
from
--
as
a
practical
matter
from
purchasing
door
or
pre-fitted
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
it
falls
within.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
literally
yes,
right.
now
our
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
now,
our
difference
is,
the
question
then
would
be
whether
what
part
of
the
proviso
--
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
control,
that's
quite
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
our
differences
here
of
course
stem
from
the
fact
that
we
view
the
basic
reach
and
thrust
of
the
two
provisions
differently
and
we
are
also
in
disagreement
as
to
the
character
of
the
agreement
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
now,
basically
mr.
mahin's
argument
it
seems
to
me
seems
to
come
down
to
this.
that
the
80th
congress
which
adopted
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
which
is
now
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
current
--
of
the
sta
--
of
the
statute.
at
the
80th
congress
here
prohibited
all
refusals,
all
employee
refusals
by
employee
to
handle
or
use
the
products
of
another
employer.
and
with
these
premises
of
foundation,
the
argument
concludes
that
the
86th
congress
in
1959
which
was
bent
on
foreclosing
loopholes
in
the
statute
certainly
does
not
intend
to
create
anything
were
non-existent
and
that
it
did
not
intend
to
permit
a
circumvention,
a
circumvention
of
the
prohibition
against
secondary
boycotts
by
agreements
which
would
require
an
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
or
to
refrain
from
using
these
projects.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
initially
to
the
argument.
the
argument
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
bans
all
employer
refusals
to
handle
the
products
of
another
employer
and
that
therefore,
when
the
union
directed
the
employees
of
frouge
not
to
handle
the
pre-fitted
doors
it
committed
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
the
weakness
of
the
argument,
the
weakness
of
the
argument
is
that
it
places
an
unwarranted
reliance
upon
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
an
approach
which
this
court
rejected
in
1951
in
the
international
rice
milling
and
rejected
again
in
general
electric
case
in
1961,
and
if
that
approach
were
to
be
followed,
it
would
mean
that
primary
strike
activity
which
necessarily
tends
to
disrupt
the
activity
--
they
have
been
to
these
relations
of
the
struck
employer
that
primary
struck
--
strike
activity
would
be
unlawful.
but
this
court
on
of
at
least
two
occasions
has
refused
to
countenance
that
kind
of
an
approach
of
the
statute
and
in
addition
to
that,
congress
in
1959
when
it
added
the
primary,
secondary
proviso
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
provision
of
the
act
unmistakably,
unmistakably
precluded
such
a
reading
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
now,
in
the
denver
building
case
which
has
won
the
first
cases
that
came
here
after
the
taft-hartley,
this
court
told
us
that
the
congressional
policy
which
is
embedded,
which
is
embedded
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
is
the
dual
congressional
policy
of
preserving
to
the
employees
the
right
to
exert
pressure
upon
in
offending
employer
and
to
be
involved
in
a
primary
dispute
and
of
shielding,
shielding
and
not
offending
employer
from
pressures
and
controversies
not
his
own.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
public
too
that's
right.
now,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
as
this
court
has
said
and
again
on
two
occasions
and
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
194
--
1947
amendments
unmistakably
indicates,
was
directed
on
what
it
is
called
the
secondary
boycott
again
in
the
language
of
this
court
who
sanctions
bear
not
upon
the
offending
employer
who
is
--
who
alone
is
involved
in
the
dispute
but
upon
some
third
party
who
has
no
concern.
the
practice
against
which
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
directed
as
the
conference
report
on
the
taft-hartley
amendments
makes
clear,
was
the
practice
of
a
union
calling
a
strike
or
engaging
in
a
work
stoppage
at
employer
a,
in
order
to
compel
employer
a
to
cease
doing
business
with
employer
b
who
is
either
non-union,
was
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
or
was
disfavored
for
some
other
reason
by
--
by
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
indicated
that
earlier
that
8

(a)
had
become

(b)
--
mr.
dominick
l.

i
thought
perhaps
i
would
not
be
confused
if
i
use
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
having
indicated
that
that
really
is
the
same
at
8
(b)

(a).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
talking
about
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
if
i
inadvertently
say
b,
what
i'm
talking
about
in
this
phase,
what
i
mean
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
now,
mr.
mahin
--
mr.
mahin
in
his
brief,
he
acknowledges
that
this
example
was
a
stock
example
that
was
used
by
the
proponents
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
as
the
ter
--
as
indicating,
demonstrating
the
scope
and
the
reach
of
that
provision.
now,
mr.
mahin
would
seek
to
persuade
us
however
that
these
illustrations
here,
that
these
examples
were
intended
to
be
merely
illustrative
and
not
intended
to
be
exclu
--
exclusive.
and
that
congress
meant
to
reach
what
he
calls
boycott
action,
even
though
--
even
though
such
action,
and
again
as
he
puts
it,
does
not
fit
into
the
stock
definition
of
a
secondary
boycott.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor,
just
one
--
one
sentence
and
i'll
be
through.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
i
think
that
in
connection
with
that
it
is
where
they're
called
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
sand
door
work
said,
congress'
purpose
was
more
narrowly
conceived,
it
aimed
to
restrict
the
area
of
industrial
conflict
insofar
as
this
could
be
achieved
by
prohibiting
the
most
obvious,
widespread
and
as
congress
evidently
judge
dangerous
practice
of
the
union
to
widen
that
conflict.
the
coercion
of
neutral
employers
themselves
not
concerned
with
their
primary
dispute
through
the
inducement
of
their
employees
to
engage
in
strikes
or
concerted
refusals
to
handle
goods.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
arose
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
addressing
myself
for
the
contention
of
the
other
side
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
barred
all
so-called
product
boycotts.
i
suggest
that
the
use
of
the
slogan,
product
boycotts,
does
not
help
--
really
help
us
resolve
our
problem.
when
congress
enacted
legislation
against
product
boycotts
it
had
in
mind
a
specific
evil
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
product
boycott.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
product.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
when
congress
congress
enacted
legislation
against
product
boycotts,
it
had
a
specific
evil
in
mind
namely
employer
refusals
to
handle
the
products
of
another
employer
who
was
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
or
who
was
nonunion
or
who
was
otherwise
disfavored,
otherwise
disfavored
by
the
union
representing
those
particular
employees.
and
that
this
was
a
device
to
exert
to
a
neutral
employer
pressure,
pressure
upon
the
employer
disfavored
by
the
union.
now
in
determining
whether
or
not
refusals
to
handle
products
coming
from
another
employer,
whether
that
was
refusals
are
a
violation
of
the
statutes
or
whether
or
not
we
must
look
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
of
congress,
we
must
look
to
the
objective
of
the
employees
or
the
union
that's
directing
them
to
refuse
to
handle
the
products
coming
from
another
employer.
now,
let
me
explain
my
meaning
with
two
illustrations.
supposed
for
example
that
you
have
my
--
employer
a,
employer
a
buys
doors
from
manufacturer
b.
the
employees
of
employer
a
are
union.
those
of
employer
b
are
nonunion.
the
employees
of
a
refuse
to
install
the
doors
coming
from
b
because
b's
doors
do
not
bear
the
union
label
and
b,
his
employees
are
nonunion.
that
was
the
situation
under
sand
door
case
which
was
before
this
court
several
years
ago.
now
let
me
give
a
second
illustration.
employer
a
under
his
contract
with
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
his
employees
is
required
and
has
traditionally
given
them
certain
work
to
be
done
on
doors,
the
finishing
of
unfinished
doors.
now
employer
a
decides
that
he
is
going
to
buy
finished
doors.
and
when
these
finished
doors
come
to
him,
his
employees
refused
to
install
those
doors.
the
reason
that
they
are
refusing
to
install
those
doors
is
because
the
employer
in
violation
of
his
agreement
not
to
assign
the
finishing
work
to
someone
else,
to
preserve
it
for
them
as
--
deprive
them
of
work
which
they
have
traditionally
been
performing
and
work
which
under
their
contract
they're
entitled
to.
now
essentially,
that
is
the
case
before
this
court
involving
the
employer
of
the
contract
to
frouge.
that
is
not
a
secondary
boycott
situation.
all
that
the
two,
the
two
examples
which
i've
given
can
be
loosely
called
as
product
boycotts.
as
product
boycotts,
there
are
differences
between
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry
i'm
having
trouble
with
that
word,
product
boycotts
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
either
they
might
giving
it
--
catching
it
or
something
wrong
with
my
voice.
i'm
speaking
of
the
product
boycotts.
as
i
said,
the
two
illustrations
which
i've
given
to
the
court,
they
are
enti
--
although
in
the
sense
they
can
be
said
to
involve
product
boycotts.
product
boycotts,
they
are
analytically
different
because
the
object
of
the
employees
who
are
refusing
to
handle
the
products
are
entirely
different.
and
the
difference
in
their
object
makes
for
wholly
different
results
under
the
statute
a
result
which
should
not
be
blurred
by
simply
imposing
upon
them
the
label,
product
boycott.
in
the
first
case
that
i
gave,
in
the
first
case
i
gave
where
the
employees
of
the
union
re
--
union
employer
a
refused
to
handle
the
doors
coming
from
a
nonunion
source,
there
the
employees
have
no
dispute
whether
own
employer
over
the
terms
or
conditions
of
their
employment.
their
dispute
is
with
the
manufacturer
b
who
is
nonunion.
and
his
doors
do
not
bear
a
union
label.
when
they
refuse
to
perform
services
for
employer
a,
their
own
employer,
and
install
these
doors,
they
are
seeking
to
exert
secondary
pressure
upon
b,
the
disfavored
employer.
that
was
i
said
was
a
situation
before
this
court
in
the
sand
door
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
stat
--
of
the
statute.
now,
in
the
second
example
which
i
gave,
which
should
i
say
is
essentially
the
case
before
this
court
involving
in.
and
in
the
frouge
incidence
--
in
the
frouge
incident,
in
the
second
case,
the
employees
of
employer
a,
they're
not
concerned
with
the
manufacture
of
the
doors
or
the
conditions
under
which
those
doors
are
manufactured.
their
concern
is
solely
with
res
--
solely
over
the
loss
of
their
work
which
they
have
traditionally
been
performing
for
their
employer
which
under
their
agreement,
he's
agreed
to
give
to
them.
their
dispute,
the
target
of
their
action
is
their
immediate
employer
over
their
own
immediate
work
opportunities.
that
is
not
a
secondary
boycott
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
that
is
the
reason
why
the
employees
of
a
are
refusing
to
handle
his
doors
then
it
would
be
a
secondary
boycott.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
(inaudible)
yes,
yes
it
is
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
that's
right.
now
the
statute
says
an
object
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
an
object
and
you
may
have
a
mixed
situation
such
as
the
one
that
your
honor
is
suggesting,
but
in
that
case
so,
if
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
are
refusing
to
handle
this
product
because
the
manufacturer
of
the
door
is
nonunion,
it
is
nonunion,
then
the
board
under
those
circumstances
would
find
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right,
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
to
which
company,
your
honor?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
one
that
--
who
wants
to
buy
that
or
the
one
that's
buying
the
doors?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
again
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
embargo
is
a
total
one
or
a
partial
one.
we
must
look
what
--
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
refusal
of
the
employees
of
employer
a
is
when
they
refused
to
handle
the
doors.
where
they
hand
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
maybe
the
consequence,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
really
the
test.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
does.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
justice
stewart,
yester
--
excuse
me.
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it's
not
difficult
to
do
because
frequently
you
will
have
the
union
a
stating
why
it's
refusing
to
handle
the
particular
products.
they
will
frequently
say
to
the
employer,
"we're
refusing
to
handle
these
products
because
b
is
nonunion.
he's
involved
in
the
labor
dispute
or
he's
got
--
or
his
doors
or
products
bear
the
label
of
some
rival
or
other
union".
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
your
honor,
let
me
get
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
that
control.
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
now
or
yesterday
got
on
the
slightly
different
wedge
of
plans.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if?
i
will.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will.
now,
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
this
particular
case
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
doors
that
--
in
the
finished
doors
which
the
employees
of
the
various
contractor
were
refusing
to
install.
some
of
them
bore
no
union,
no
label
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
others
bore
the
label
of
this
particular
union
and
still
others
bore
the
label
of
some
other
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
if
the
other
--
if
the
supplier
of
the
doors,
if
his
people
are
unionized,
and
that
employers
or
the
purchaser
said,
"that
is
our
work.
that
is
our
work".
in
our
view
that
would
be
primary
dispute.
they're
not
concerned
with
the
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
you
have
to
see
what
the
purpose
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
purpose
of
the
union
is
to
preserve
work,
is
to
preserve
work
for
the
employees
of
the
immediate
employer
involved
there,
then
i
would
say
it
--
that
was
protected
activity.that
was
not
--
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
let
me
get
to
allen
bradley
now
your
honor
because
i'm
just
at
that
point.
the
other
side
of
course
has
placed
a
great
deal
of
reliance
upon
the
legislative
references
in
the
1947
debates
on
the
taft-hartley
amendments
--
on
the
legislative
references
for
the
allen
bradley
case.
to
begin
with,
i
think
we
should
note
that
congress
as
the
conference
report
makes
clear
as
the
remarks
of
senator
taft
make
clear
viewed
that
case
as
involving
a
simple
and
a
classic
secondary
boycott
namely
where
the
employees
of
one
employer
were
refusing
to
install
certain
electrical
equipment
because
it
came
from
another
employer
where
there
was
another
union.
where
there
was
another
union
which
represented
those
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
because
of
that.
that's
the
way
they
say
the
conference
report
viewed
that
case
and
that's
the
way
senator
taft
view
it.
but
now
let's
look
at
the
particular
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
i
believe
we
can
distinguish
it
from
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
in
that
case,
the
union
which
represented
the
employees
of
the
new
york
city
contractors,
electrical
contractors,
it
had
no
dispute,
there
was
no
dispute
between
them
--
between
the
union
and
the
new
york
city
contractors.
but
under
an
agreement
between
the
contractors
and
the
union,
the
union
directed
the
employees
of
the
contractors
not
to
install
electrical
equipment
to
--
which
came
from
outside
of
the
city
of
new
york.
now
the
union's
purpose
in
doing
this
was
to
create
a
sheltered
market
for
the
new
york
city
manufacturers.
new
york
manufacturers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
it
was
to
create
a
sheltered
market
for
the
(inaudible)
for
the
new
york
city
manufacturers
and
of
course
the
union
indirectly
hope
to
obtain
the
advantage
of
an
increasing
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
directly
or
indirectly
as
you
will
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
which
employees?
it
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
attempting
to
create
more
work
for
its
members
who
were
employed
by
the
new
york
city
manufacturers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
new
york
city
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not,
no
it
is
not
your
honor.
as
new
york
manufacturers,
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
creating
more
work
for
the
employees
of
the
new
york
city
contractors.
now,
in
our
case,
in
--
and
because
of
that
the
union
there
refused
to
permit
the
new
york
city
contractor's
employees
who
had
no
dispute
to
perform
--
to
install
certain
equipment.
and
its
objective
was
to
obtain
certain
advantages
somewhere
else,
in
the
new
york
city
manufacturers,
who
employed
its
members.
in
our
case,
unlike
that
one
here,
the
union
is
seeking
to
obtain
it
--
protect
the
work
opportunities
of
the
employees
who
are
immediately
involved
in
this
labor
dispute
and
who
are
refusing
to
install
the
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
have
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
they
have
a
collective
bargaining
contract
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
with
all
the
employees
there
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
the
fact
that
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
fact
that
its
employer
or
a
collection
of
five
with
respect
to
each
one
of
them,
you
have
a
work
preservation
object.
now,
as
they
say,
the
fact
that
the
result
as
you
were
say
--
asking
me
yesterday
mr.
justice,
that
the
end
result
may
be
the
--
end
result
may
be
the
same.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
test.
in
one
case,
if
the
target
maybe
the
other
fellow,
the
supplier
of
the
doors,
that's
bad
when
he
is
the
target.
in
the
other
case,
where
the
target
is
the
immediate
employer,
even
--
the
effect
that
it
may
have
upon
this
supplier
of
the
door
is
an
incidental,
it's
a
by-product
if
you
will.
it's
a
by-product
of
the
primary
labor
dispute
over
the
preservation
of
work
between
the
--
between
employer
a
and
his
employee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
course
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
--
you
would
take
a
case
of
a
primary
strike,
primary
picket.
secondary
--
neutral
employers
are
hit
when
they
come
up
to
that
line.
they're
turned
away.
they're
dissuaded
from
going
there
and
they're
hit
and
yet
that
effect
as
this
court
has
said
is
incidental
to
a
legitimate
primary
activity.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
talking
about
a
primary,
it's
a
strike
bound
plan.
and
the
neutral
drivers,
drivers
who
bring
in
supplies
for
that
particular
contract
they
come
down,
they're
turned
away.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they're
turned
away
and
there
may
even
be
violence
on
the
--
at
the
primary
picket
line
turning
these
people
away.
they're
being
hit.
and
yet
the
court
has
said
that
that's
merely
incidental
to
a
legitimate
primary
activities
and
its
law.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
let
me
give
an
example,
we
had
the
sound
shingle
case
some
years
ago
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there,
the
union
represented
the
employers
of
an
american
manufacturer
of
shingles
(inaudible)
american
manufacturer
of
shingle,
one
who
use
shingles.
that
particular
person
was
buying
shingles
from
a
canadian
manufacturer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
from
a
canadian
manufacturer
and
the
union
did
not
want
the
american
employer
to
buy
shingles
from
the
canadian
manufacturer.
the
reason
they
didn't
want
to
buy,
the
reason
they
didn't
want
them
(inaudible)
it
is
because
canadian
manufacturer
working
standards
were
lower
than
those
here
and
they
--
of
the
american
manufacturer
and
the
canadian
manufacturer
was
nonunion.
now,
in
that
case,
the
union's
object,
the
target
of
the
union's
action
was
the
canadian
manufacturer
because
he
was
disfavored.
he
was
disfavored
because
he
was
nonunion
and
its
working
conditions
were
not
the
same
as
those
of
the
union
within
this
country.
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
board
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
why
was
it
a
violation
of
the
statute?
it
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
because
the
union
had
no
dispute
with
the
american
manufacturer.
its
dispute
was
directed
to
the
canadian,
to
the
canadian
manufacturer.
now,
if
there
had
been
no
dispute
with
the
canadian
manufacturer
and
the
dispute
had
been
solely
with
the
american
manufacturer
over
the
preservation
of
work,
the
fact
that
that
would've
prevented
canadian
goods
from
coming
into
this
state
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
was
secondary
or
primary.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
fact
that
it
might
result
in
that.
that
it
might
result
in
shutting
out
certain
supplies
from
coming
across
state
lines
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
its
primary
or
secondary
activity
under
this
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
such
finding
here.
the
board
never
addressed
itself
to
the
problem
whether
it
was
to
bar
or
not
to
bar
interstate
--
out
of
state
goods
because
it's
irrelevant
i
suggest.
it's
irrelevant
i
suggest
to
the
question
of
whether
its
primary
or
secondary.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
so
far
as
i
know
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
your
own
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
those
circumstances
we
would
say
your
honor
that
the
act
or
refusal,
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
those
circumstances
we
would
say
that
the
refusal
of
employer
--
of
the
employers
of
employee
a
to
install
those
doors
in
order
to
protect
the
interest,
the
interest
of
people
in
some
other
unit,
that
this
was
secondary.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
they
can
only
do
it
to
protect
their
own
immediate
work
interest.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i've
admitted
that
your
honor
that
literally
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
indeed
you
do.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
yes.
reason
having
to
do
where
the
person
--
who
the
person
who
was
supplying
the
goods
and
if
i
may
just
make
a
brief
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
of
course
the
court
had
all
of
this
legislative
history
in
the
international
rice
milling
case
which
we
had
here
back
in
1951.
and
this
morning
i
picked
up
our
brief
in
that
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
allen
bradley?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
the
court
--
the
congress
mentioned
allen
bradley
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
as
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
was.
and
as
i
have
said
--
as
i've
said,
number
one,
con
--
senator
taft
and
the
conference
report
viewed
that
as
a
simple
classic
secondary
boycott
of
the
employers
belonging
to
union
a
refusing
to
handle
the
goods
coming
from
another
source
where
there
was
another
union
in
the
picture.
and
the
--
just
let
me
read,
i
won't
take
the
time
to
read
the
whole
quotation,
but
just
let
me
read
what
senator
taft
said
in
connection
with
8
(b)
(4),
of
the
original
amendment."
this
provision
makes
it
unlawful
to
resort
to
a
secondary
boycott
to
injure
the
business
of
a
third
person
who
was
wholly
unconcerned
in
the
disagreement
between
an
employer
and
his
employees".
then
it
goes
to
say,
"we've
heard
all
kinds
of
talk
that
there
are
good
secondary
boycotts
and
bad
secondary
boycotts".
but
the
emphasis
is
repeatedly
is
on
secondary
boycotts.
then
after
he
having
said
that,
he
says,
"take
a
case
in
which
the
employer
is
getting
along
perfectly
with
his
employees.
they
agree
on
wages.
wages
and
working
conditions
are
satisfactory
on
both
sides.
someone
else
says
to
those
employers,
we
want
you
to
strike
against
your
employer
because
he
happens
to
be
handling
some
product
which
we
do
not
like.
we
do
not
think
it
is
made
under
proper
conditions".
of
course
it
goes
on
to
say
if
that
were
encouraged,
it
wouldn't
create
all
kinds
of
problems.
and
finally
concludes,
"we
condemn
the
view
that
if
other
workers
do
not
like
the
way
some
employer
is
treating
is
treating
his
employees,
they
can
promote
strikes
in
any
other
plant
which
happens
to
be
handling
the
product
of
the
plant
whose
management
that
the
workers
do
not
like.
that's
the
gloss
of
course
that
is
imposed
upon
that
literal
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
is
replete.
in
fact
mr.
mahin
acknowledges
that
that
was
the
stock
illustration
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
a
(voice
overlap)
illustration
he
used
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
used
by
the
proponents
of
that
legislation
and
i
suggest
it
was
the
only,
it
was
an
excuse
--
it
was
the
only
type
to
say,
a
boycott
that
they
were
trying
to
reach.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
honor,
i
took
special
precautions
to
check
on
that
case
and
i
suggest
that
if
you
were
to
go
back
to
reading
your
own
opinion,
i
do
suggest
that
you
also
read
in
connection
with
it
the
board's
decision
because
--
where
there's
one
factor
that
is
not
clear
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
which
your
honor
wrote.
that
case,
it
was
precisely
the
sand
door
case
where
the
employees
of
employer
a
refused
to
handle
doors
or
sojme
material,
equipment,
product,
whatever
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
doors.
that
were
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
coming
from
another
source,
from
the
manufacturer
whose
employees
belong
to
some
other
union.
and
as
i
say
that
fact
is
noted
clearly
in
the
board's
decision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
were
prefabricated
doors.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
the
reason
was
not
that.
the
reason
that
the
union
gave
--
the
reason
that
the
board
found
--
which
under
--
which
caused
the
union
to
take
the
action
it
did
is
not
because
they
were
prefabricated
but
because
they
bore
the
label
of
some
--
because
there
were
some
--
some
other
union
people
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
confess,
i
--
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
as
i
read
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
reading
the
case,
going
back
to
the
boards'
decision.
it
seemed
to
be
essentially
like
the
sand
door
situation
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
mr.
(inaudible)
tells
that
there
was
a
union
rule
involved
there
but
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sure
you'll
--
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
in
my
little
note
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
he
--
no,
no,
its
--
i
have
it
here
somewhere,
the
--
but
passing
over
that
he
is
responding
to
senator
pepper.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he's
responding
to
senator
pepper
because
senator
pepper
was
taking
the
position
that
certain
types
of
secondary
boycotts
were
alright
where
a
union
was
trying
to
preserve
organizational
benefits
or
bondages
or
gains
that
--
or
a
union
was
trying
to
engage
in
a
secondary
boycott
against
some
employer
whose
standards
or
conditions
of
employment
were
not
as
good
as
that.
the
union
thought
that
they
should
be.
senator
pepper
was
making
the
argument.
that
was
a
good
secondary
boycott
in
that
situation.
so
in
response
to
that
line
of
arguments
senator
taft
says
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i'm
reading
from
the
brief
of
the
other
side
in
number
110,
111,
and
it's
at
page
63.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
senator
taft,
i
should
say.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am
suggesting
--
it
helps
us
that
the
allen
bradley
case,
it
is
not
our
case
here.
in
our
case,
the
employees
of
the
contractor
frouge
we're
not
refusing
to
install
these
doors
because
the
manufacturer
of
the
doors
was
rep
--
his
employers
were
represented
by
some
other
union.
they
had
no
concern.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
were
not
con
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
we
are
simply
stating
a
fact
that
it
came
from
out
of
state.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
may
have
been
a
crucial
fact
in
deciding
the
antitrust
aspect
of
it
but
in
viewing
it
under
(inaudible),
i
think
he
was
simply
stating
the
fact
that
they
came
--
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
this
argument
whether
they
came
in
or
out
of
the
state.
because
the
union
there
as
he
saw
the
case
was
refusing
to
handle
the
products
of
another
employer
whose
people
were
represented
by
another
union.
now,
i
think
i
better
get
to
my
time
has
--
would
be
to
run
fast.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
address
myself
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
address
myself
to
that
question
and
i
think
i
know
what
may
be
troubling
the
court
there
because
there
seems
to
be
some
apparent
inconsistency
between
the
board
saying
in
the
case
of
frouge,
it
was
permissible
legitimate
primary
activity
but
in
the
case
of
the
other
employer
it
was
secondary.
now
let's
see
if
i
can
explain
that.
all
of
these
contractors
here
were
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
effect
of
which
was
to
bar
them
from
subcontracting
the
finishing
of
--
the
finishing
work
on
doors.
three
of
these
employers
--
three
of
these
contractors,
i'm
sorry,
i
moved
away
from
that.
three
of
these
contractors
here
who
are
parties
to
this
agreement
here,
they
ignored
their
agreement
and
the
accepted
specifications
from
the
project
owners
and
those
specifications
called
for
finished
doors.
the
fourth
contractor,
frouge,
the
fourth
contractor,
his
specifications
did
not
require
him
to
use
those
doors.
now
with
respect
with
to
the
three
employers
who
in
this
regard
of
their
own
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
whatever
obligations
they
may
have
owed
to
their
employees
under
that
agreement
in
disregard
of
that,
they
have
taken
as
i
say
a
contract
which
is
now
taking
the
work
out
of
their
hands,
and
of
course
their
employers
have
been
denied
of
certain
work.
now
in
that
case,
the
board
held
that
this
was
secondary
activity
because
the
control,
the
control
over
the
dispute
had
passed
from
those
contractors
to
the
project
owners.
that
in
that
particular
context
the
board
then
deemed
the
union's
refusal
to
install
the
doors
as
being
direct
at
least
impart,
that
had
been
directed
at
least
to
impart
to
neutral
employers
namely
the
project
owners.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
it
--
it's
sticky,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
i
should
take
comfort
out
of
the
fact
that
those
--
that
particular
part
of
the
--
the
face
of
the
board's
case
is
not
before
this
court.
now
to
what
is
before
this
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you
--
we
can't
disregard
it.
now
with
respect
to
frouge,
i
am
trying
to
just
round
out
the
answer
to
your
question.
with
respect
to
frouge,
frouge
again
he
was
--
had
some
--
an
obligation
to
his
employees
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
his
specifications
did
not
call
for
prefinished
doors,
therefore
their
resolution
to
the
dispute
was
what
--
it
--
lay
with
him.
and
he
is
the
target.
he
is
the
only
target
of
the
union's
action.
now,
let
me
go
on
if
i
may
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
is
incidental
to
the
primary
dispute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
it
could
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
might
get
fired.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
element
of
control
as
we
think
that
the
board
saw
this
is
simply
one
of
the
elements
that
indicates
who
is
the
primary
target
of
the
union's
refusal
or
work
stoppage?
now
in
this
particular
case,
these
employees
had
traditionally
been
performing
this
work.
they
had
an
agreement
with
their
employer
that
they
were
going
to
get
this
work.
and
at
the
point
where
the
dispute
came
to
a
head,
the
point
where
the
dispute
came
to
a
head,
frouge
alone
had
complete
control
over
the
resolution
of
that
dispute.
and
he
could
have
resolved
the
dispute.
he
could
have
settled
it.
and
therefore
because
of
all
of
these
factors,
all
of
these
factors,
he
is
the
sole
and
primary
target
of
the
union's
action.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
was
a
work
preservation
agreement
and
that
the
employers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
i
have
only
apparently
four-five
minutes
and
i
want
to
get
into
the
section
8
(e)
aspect
of
the
case.
the
argument
of
course
here
is
being
made
that
the
agreement
here
between
the
contractors
and
their
employees
which
barred
the
use
of
these
prefinished
doors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
agreement
generally,
the
court,
lower
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
found
was
bad,
was
valid
--
in
violation
of
8
(e).
now
the
--
section
8
(e)
does
not
have
in
specific
terms
the
primary
--
secondary
provision
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
and
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(e)
with
the
construction
in
the
proviso,
whatever
significance
maybe
and
i'll
try
to
come
to
that
before
the
end
of
my
time.
with
that
to
one
side,
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(e)
would
appear
to
make
this
particular
agreement
unlawful
because
the
agreement
in
effect
permits
the
signatory
employer
to
refrain
from
buying
finished
doors
from
some
other
employer.
but
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
i
again
suggest
is
not
the
end
of
our
inquiry.
i
don't
think
we
needed
to
subscribe
to
the
proposition
that
the
surest
way
to
misread
the
statute
is
to
read
it
literally.
but
is
a
notorious
fact
that
the
1959
amendments
to
this
act
were
far
from
models
of
legislative
clarity.
and
section
8
(e)
is
unusually
deceptive.
it
is
unusually
deceptive
and
we
can
only
understand
it.
we
can
really
only
appreciate
the
true
meaning
of
that
language
only
in
the
like
of
it's
ever
--
of
its
genesis
and
its
legislative
evolution.
now
section
8
(e),
the
language
of
section
8
(e)
tracks
the
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
or
now
presently
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
in
the
current
statute.
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
reorient
the
thrust
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
boycotts
or
to
redefine
them.
as
one
commentator
has
set,
the
legislative
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
congress'
primary
concern
was
with
a
hot
cargo
clause
and
in
the
utility.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i'll
never
be
able
to
finish
it.
in
their
utility
for
circumventing,
the
then
existing
ban
against
secondary
pressures,
and
i'll
have
to
telescope
this.
the
evidence
that
--
the
legislative
evidence
i
think
unquestionably
demonstrates
that
the
overriding
concern
and
the
preoccupation
of
the
congress
when
it
enacted
section
8
(e)
was
with
hot
cargo
clauses.
clauses
which
would
bar
an
employer
from
doing
business
with
another
employer
involved
in
a
dispute
or
nonunion
or
otherwise
disfavored.
and
that
was
the
sole
purpose
of
the
--
of
section
8
(e)
was
to
deal
with
those
clauses
which
were
repeatedly
defined
along
the
lines
that
i
have
suggested.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
wish
i
had
more
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
case
of
the
three
contractors
who
with
accepted
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
specifications
calling
for
the
finished
doors,
the
board
found
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
between
all
of
the
contractors
and
the
union
was
valid
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
under
the
work
preservation
agreement
under
8
(e).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
--
yes,
that's
my
collection.
they
dismissed
the
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
the
board
has
said
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
cardinal
case
--
in
our
case
here,
the
board
separated
the
8
(e)
agree
--
the
agreement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
thank
you.
