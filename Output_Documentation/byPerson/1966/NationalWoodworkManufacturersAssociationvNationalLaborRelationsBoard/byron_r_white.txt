but
what
was
the
basis
for
the
illegality
in
these
other
cases?
justice
byron

white
what
are
you
reading,
you're
reading
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
prospectus
before
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
same
thing
that
the
board
puts
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
confer
with
the
time
to
control
the
board's
need
to
(inaudible)
whether
the
job
is
controlled?
justice
byron

even
if
the
grounds
were
set
on
these.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
grounds
were
set
on,
the
board
would
be
upheld.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
came
to
mean
that
they
were
doing
such
thing
that
said
that
this
portion
will
not
use
prefabricated
doors?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
part
of
the
rule
says
that
in
order
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
mean
to
be
fabricated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
fixed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
going
to
the
extent
that
you
didn't
--
would
you
--
would
--
would
the
argument
be
the
same
as
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
also
says
that
if
the
glasses
for
example
like
(inaudible)
if
the
union
and
the
employer
then
agree
--
then
agree
the
employer
will
not
contract
fibreboard,
could
it
happen
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
fibreboard
doesn't
happen
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fibreboard
doesn't
claim
to
make
the
contractor's
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
would
have
said
that
the
bargain
will
have
provision
of
its
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
agree
with
the
board,
i
think
that
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
and
8
(e)
should
be
construed
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
that
was
intended
by
the
--
that
it
was
intended
for
the
labor
union
that
--
that's
what
it
comes
from.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
expected
what
kind
of
work
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
assume
that
--
that
the
rule
is
that
these
county
workers
have
decided
not
in
their
own,
that
that's
exempted
in
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
view
in
the
affirmative
that
may
it
well
be
that
then
--
that
(a)
(e)
covers
or
there
was
no
one
other
important
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
why
the
--
did
you
have
to
have
two
employers
involve?
(inaudible)
of
the
two
employers
involved
and
that
the
review
will
take
the
place
on
the
site
of
construction
and
no
other
place
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
with
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
would
be
then
your
position
is
correct
that
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
still
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
that
it
had
the
part
that
we're
dealing
here
(inaudible)
and
that
the
board
had
sort
of
admission
part
of
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
also
a
union
rule,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
this
is
a
union
rule
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
man
--
manoli,
i
think
if
the
board
did
say
then
that
the
contractor
cited
rule
17
which
free
to
bid
on
jobs
and
to
accept
jobs
which
require
the
use
of
prefab
doors.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
know,
but
i
--
i
don't
see
how
they
could
have
ruled
on
the
fourth
case
the
way
they
did
without
saying
the
contract
is
completely
free
to
bid
on
jobs
that
requires
--
that
require
prefab
doors
to
be
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
could
--
he
could
--
that
he
could
arrange
all
of
his
jobs
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
gather
whether
or
not
the
employees
of
the
manufacturer
of
the
doors
are
organized
and
without
regard
if
they
are
organized,
what
the
union
is,
they
belong
to,
do
you
say
that
the
evidence
then
would
be
more
favorable
to
the
conclusion
that
they're
actually
in
this
incidence,
just
insisting
on
the
work
for
themselves
because
the
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
a
contract
to
preserve
the
work
for
them,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
what
the
--
did
the
court
of
appeals
decide
against
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
that
--
that's
it's
an
8
(e)
as
well
against
the
one
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you
just
--
is
it
your
claim
that
the
--
is
it
the
board's
claim
that
the
--
that
in
the
case
of
one
employer
there
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
and
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
on
those
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
--
but
they
claim
not
of
8
(e)?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
they
say
there
is
no
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
those
three
contractors?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
board
does
not
claim
that
8
(e)
and
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
are
to
be
construed
the
same
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
have
said
it
but
i
don't
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
but
i
just
had
a
very
great
difficulty
understanding
why
this
case
goes
to
three
contractors
that
--
can
get
a
(b)
and
not
an
(a)
but
maybe
i
was
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
proviso
that
this
section
will
not
interfere
with
primary
activity
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
am
i.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
you
have
to
argue
that
there
is
no
primary
activity
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
going
to
ask
you
--
that
is
--
i
understand
that
--
and
i
--
i
think
i
understand
that
you
say
there
was
both
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it's
--
but
if
the
proviso
says
that
this
section
is
not
to
result
in
the
interference
with
primary
activities,
is
that
what
it
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
the
other
objective,
the
embargo
as
you
call
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
way
you
can
stop
that
is
by
stopping
primary
activity
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
seems
to
me
you've
(inaudible)
--
you've
done
just
exactly
what
the
proviso
says
you
can't
do.
if
you
can't
stop
the
other
objective
without
stopping
your
primary
objective,
why
do
you
not
violate
the
embargo?
i
mean,
violate
the
proviso.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
you
would
like
to
(inaudible)
or
view
it
like
--
to
construe
the
proviso
in
accordance
with
it's
legislative
or
case
history
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
want
to
construed
8
(e)
or
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
to
construe
it
on
its
face.
now,
what
about
on
the
face
of
the
proviso?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
say,
primary
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
word
it
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
a
primary
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
care
whether
there
was
a
labor
dispute
with
the
other
employer
whose
product
was
being
boycotted
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
agree
then
that
we
are
having
--
if
the
--
that
the
--
that
one
of
the
things
you
have
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
explore
the
limits
of
fibreboard?
justice
byron
r.
white
different
ballpark?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
was
the
basis
for
the
illegality
in
these
other
cases?
justice
byron

white
what
are
you
reading,
you're
reading
from?
justice
byron

alright.

(a)

on

i
was

the

how
about

you
say
there
was
both

but
it
seems
to
me
you've
(inaudible)
--
you've
done
just
exactly
what
the
proviso
says
you
can't
do.
if
you
can't
stop
the
other
objective
without
stopping
your
primary
objective,
why
do
you
not
violate
the
embargo?
i
mean,
violate
the
proviso.
justice

of
the

it's
a

justice
byron

white
you
don't
care
whether

dispute
with
the
other

whose
product
was
being
boycotted
or
not.
justice
byron
r.

but
you
do
agree
then
that
we
are
having
