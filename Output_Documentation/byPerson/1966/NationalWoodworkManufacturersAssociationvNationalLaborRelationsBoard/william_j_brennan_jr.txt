i

mr.
mahin,
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

supposed
this
one
with
the
bill
had
been
a
failure
of
this
whereas
for
35
years,
now
this
contractor
has
had
doors
submitted
by
the
employee
either
on
the
jobsite
or
in
the
employer
at
the
plant.
now,
whereas
the
parties
intend
that
that
practice
of
jobs
continues
in
the
end
that
his
employee
may
always
enjoin
that
work
and
therefore
they
were
sure
that
these
would
be
the
cases
with
the
features.
the
employer
say
that
they
will
not
buy
any
offsite
and
any
type
of
prefabricated
doors
to
install
on
any
workplace
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
that's
the
whole
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
make
assignments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
think
you're
going
to
stress
that
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
confine
a
part
of
it
in
the
principle
of
fibreboard
and
the
subcontracting
of
maintenance
first
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
in
that
is
as
i
recall
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
also
had
to
do
with
--
with
how
did
you
work,
fill
them
on
the
premises
by
offsite
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
bring
in
the
subcontract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
basis
for
your
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
take
it
supposed
that
--
yes,
supposed
--
supposed
what
we
had
is
a
--
is
a
door
manufacturer
and
there
were
in
the
beginning
that
a
particular
time
before
it
could
always
be
made
at
his
plant.
and
as
he
would
never
contract
out
of
the
biggest
manufacturer
of
the
door
or
instead
of
--
out
of
the
manufacturer
to
agree
that
he
would
never
purchase
this
kind
of
doors,
suppose
that
would
have
followed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
it
does
with
fabricated
doors
come
out
of
the
place
of
working
premises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
by
controlling
an
industry
note,
it
--
he
could
use
prefabricated
doors
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
you
meant
by
control.
he
had
a
choice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
the
union
in
insisting
he
live
up
to
the
agreement
was
putting
pressure
on
him
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
make
a
choice
that
he
was
agreeably
to
make
under
the
contract
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
wasn't
that
voice,
you
said
it's
a
choice.
that
was
a
condition
he
imposed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
contract,
they
didn't
have
gotten
the
contract
except
--
except
to
that
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
in
8
(b)
(4)
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
although
he
had
a
contract
with
the
union
which
included
with
--
this
rule
17
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
nothing
about
that
provision
in
rule
17,
prevented
him
--
prevented
him
from
bidding
for
and
accepting
jobs
with
project
owners
who
insisted
up
--
as
a
condition
of
giving
him
the
contract
that
he
use
only
prefabricated
doors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
that
--
what
really
it
must
come
down
to
this
judgment
that
he
was
free
to
preclude
himself,
to
preclude
himself
from
having
his
employees
complete
the
fitting
and
so
forth
if
he
wanted
to
make
an
agreement
with
the
project
owner
that
he
would
supply
at
the
project
owner's
insistent
prefabricated
doors,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
he
did
--
there's
nothing
about
17
that
prevented
him
from
doing
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
--
isn't
it
implicit
in
the
board's
decision
that
there
was
nothing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
about
17
which
precluded
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
like
--
i
know
you
get
the
--
much
quite
clear
why
we
have
the
8
(e)
issue
here
as
to
those
pre-contractors
if
they're
satisfied
with
the
holding
of
the
8
(b)

(b)
violation
extent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'll
get
to
that,
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
the
word
complementary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
am
i
right
if
in
this
case,
it
was
the
next
case,
somewhere,
where
a
refusal
was
to
handle
doors
and
even
though
the
doors,
the
manufacturer
of
the
doors
was
an
organized
shop
and
indeed
the
very
union
that
was
involved
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
gather
you
say
that
the
--
if
they
refuse
to
handle
doors
manufactured
--
the
plant
organized
by
the
very
same
union
that
or
in
and
of
itself
to
establish
that
their
dispute
here
is
only
with
their
own
employer
with
--
asking
their
own
employer
to
perform
his
agreement
with
them
that
they
should
have
the
work
and
not
the
--
how

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
manoli,
i
suppose
congress
might
legislate
against
what
you
say
was
the
purpose
of
the
union
here
namely
a
refusal
to
handle
out
of
state
products
even
though
the
reason
for
the
refusal
to
handle
it
was
what
you
termed,
work
preservation,
congress
could

--
there
should
be
no
constitutional

if
congress

justice
william
j.
brennan,

then
i
take
it
the
only

justice
william

that's

justice

mr.

i
gather

that

had

you'd
have
a

justice
william

you
have

limit

yes.

so
it

and
that
was

was

the

the

made
is,
