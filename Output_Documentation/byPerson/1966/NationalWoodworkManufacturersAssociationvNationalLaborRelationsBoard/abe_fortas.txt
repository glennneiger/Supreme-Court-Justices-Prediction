justice
abe
fortas
if
you
would
draw
the
line
--
you
would
draw
the
line
simply
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
product
is
made
offsite,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
qualification
that
should
make
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
my
brother
white's
questions
it
seems
to
me
test
what
you've
just
said
because
suppose
in
the
search
for
the
lucid
quality
of
intent,
it
is
established
that
all
he
had
wanted
to
do
was
to
have
all
the
work
done
on
site
and
here
comes
in
some
product
that's
prefabricated
offsite
and
he
says,
"my
intent
is
pure."
you
can't
bring
in
this
product
--
these
doors
that
are
fabricated
offsite.
so
that
it
could
get
just
to
the
question
of
intent,
perhaps
it's
very
difficult
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
case.
so
i
was
asking
you
whether
the
standard
that
you're
suggesting
to
us
is
the
objective
one
in
this
proclaimed
simple
line
between
onsite
and
offsite
or
--
or
whether
he
had
some
other
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
standards
in
mind.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you'd
do
it
right.
i
understand
you
--
i'm
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
so
that's
why
i'm
seeking
information
there.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
do.
you
would
then
draw
the
line
regardless
of
intent
really,
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
supposed
in
the
second
case
you
put,
it
also
turns
out
that
b,
the
manufacturer
of
the
doors
is
a
nonunion
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
always
have
as
the
intent
or
the
reason
controlling
is
of
mthe
subject
of
test?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
subject
of
test
and
you
look
to
the
dominant
motive
that
maybe
several
motives,
but
you
look
to
the
dominant
motive,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
supposed
the
manufacturer
of
the
door,
his
employees,
that
it
just
has
a
contract
with
the
--
a
different
union,
another
union,
a
un
--
and
that's
objectionable
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
--
that
will
make
no
difference
whether
--
that
you
treat
that
just
like
your
nonunion
example.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
--
in
this
argument,
you're
departing
from
the
board's
reason
which
was
the
control
fact,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh!
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument
if
you'll
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
take
care
of
it
--
want
to
take
care
of
it
later.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
interested
--
justice
abe
fortas
your
honor,
if
their
purpose
--
we
have
to
look
what
the
purpose
of
the
union
is.
i
am
restating
what
i
said
before
but
i
don't
know
how
else
to
restate
it.
if
their
purpose
is
to
preserve
work
for
the
employees
who
are
immediately
involved
in
the
labor
dispute.
it's
irrelevant
whether
or
not
interstate
goods
are
being
prevented
from
coming
out
--
oh,
goods
are
prevented
from
coming
across
state
lines.
it
is
still
work
present
--
a
work
preservation
dispute
and
under
the
statute,
this
is
legitimate
primary
activity.
now,
that
was
the
case
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
manoli,
may
i
ask
you
for
the
reference
for
me,
something
you
said
a
moment
ago,
is
the
permissible
purpose
here
confined
to
the
particular
employer
or
does
it
extend
to
employees
of
--
all
employees
covered
by
the
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
to
say,
let's
suppose
you
have
a
collective
bargain
--
a
single
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
covers
all
of
the
contractors
in
philadelphia.
justice
abe
fortas
and
let's
suppose
that
the
employees
of
contractor
a
say,
"we
won't
handle
such
and
such
a
prefabricated
product
because
if
we
handle
that,
it
would
injure
other
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
labor
collective
bargaining
agreement".
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
under
the
--
although
it's
the
same
collective
bargaining
agree
--
justice
abe
fortas
be
sure
to
get
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
will.
justice
abe
fortas
you
will
address
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
except
that
the
contractors
in
those
three
cases
deliberately
did
it
and
did
it
as
you've
just
said
in
violation
of
their
contract.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
if
this
thing
gets
to
me,
it
look
more
and
more
like
tweedledee
and
tweedledum,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
sticky,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
at
least
before
--
it's
before
this
court
--
but
maybe
before
this
court
as
an
intellectual
theoretical
matter,
critical
importance
even
though
it
may
not
be
in
the
issues
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes?
justice
abe
fortas
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
case
of
frouge,
in
the
case
--
let's
take
the
case
of
frouge.
he
is
the
primary
the
primary
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
the
manufacturer
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
this
dispute.
justice
abe
fortas
he
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
--
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
action
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
action
of
the
employees
however
is
not
directed
against
them,
it's
directed
against
their
own
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
primary
dispute.
now,
what
effect
it
may
have
upon
the
manufacturers
of
the
door,
that
is
simply
incidental
at
least
in
our
view
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
manoli
this
has
absolutely
no
relationship
that
i
can
see
with
the
--
your
argument.
that
is
to
say
the
fact
--
the
determinative
factors
that
you
have
laid
out
here
which
relate
to
the
intent
of
the
particular
union
and
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
factor
of
who
controls
so
far
as
i
can
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
on
page
5
of
government's
brief
in
111,
say
that
the
board
reasoned
that
since
the
three
contractors
in
contrast
to
frouge
did
not
have
control
over
the
work
that
the
union
sought
to
protect
for
its
employees.
the
union's
objective
was
secondary.
now
your
argument
unless
i
have
missed
it,
your
argument
as
to
the
correct
analysis
of
the
statutory
provisions
here
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
control.
it
has
to
do
with
the
intent,
the
purpose
of
the
union.
now
that's
what
i
like
you
to
reconcile
for
me
or
argue
abandoning
the
board's
distinction.
i
would
not
off
hand,
i
would
not
find
that
side
religious.
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
define
that
--
define
that
with
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
board
make
any
findings
as
to
the
intent
or
purpose
of
the
union
in
the
frouge
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
that's
a
conclusion.
how
about
the
specific
point
that
you
have
been
emphasizing
in
your
argument?
if
the
board
find
that
the
purpose
was
--
of
the
union
was
work
preservation
rather
than
something
else.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
where
--
that
there
again,
congress
intended
that
the
intent
or
purpose
could
be
determinative?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
position
you're
taking
if
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
correctly
understand
that,
cut
seems
to
me,
they
cut
pretty
deep.
it
would
mean
that
the
union
can
in
no
case
--
a
construction
union
can
in
no
case
make
a
valid
contract
to
assure
that
its
members
get
to
do
a
traditional
and
historic
work.
justice
abe
fortas
he
might
do
that,
might
he
not?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
thrust
of
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
has
to
take
them
as
they
are
brought
in
to
the
jobsite
where
there's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
prefabricated
--
fitted
--
pre-fitted
or
whatnot.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
would

the
line

would

you
can't

so
that
it
could
get

the

perhaps
it's
very
