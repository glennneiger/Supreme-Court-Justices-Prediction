justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
chapman,
i
don't
suppose
it's
too
important
to
have
--
to
tell
them
there's
no
name
and
number
of
the
street
on
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
is
the
actual
or
facsimile,
the
actual
certificate
that
was
brought,
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
blanked
it
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
in
the
history
of
the
statute?
does
this
follow
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
statute
older
than
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
subsequent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
what
brought
it
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
history
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask
you
mrs.
friedlander,
do
i
gather
that
in
your
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
state
operator
totally,
do
you
suggest
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
what
happens
in
nevada
for
example
or
as
i
understand
that
the
operations
while
they're
legal
are
not
state
operators?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
you
don't
--
you
do
not
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
--
whether
those
operations
go
within
or
without
this
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
--
and
this
argument
i
gather
is
that
congress
never
contemplated
including
other
van
as
you
have
put
it
in
your
appendix,
those
are
not
--
that
states
or
public
authorities
with
those
whether
illegal
or
not,
individuals
engaged
in
gambling
operation
as
calling
within
the
prohibitions
of
this
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
congress
never
contemplated
that
a
state
operator
at
a
price
like
this
or
anything
connected
with
it
would
come
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
nothing
affirmative
to
it
--
to
suggest
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
pari-mutuel
as
i
gather
are
state
regulated
ordinarily,
are
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
most
of
the
--
and
there's
an
expressed
exception
for
the
state
regulated
pari-mutuel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
point
to
that
as
indicating
that
they
simply
never
intended
to
include
that
when
a
state
regulation
pari-mutuel
here
--
state
operation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
did
concede
that
if
in
this
instance,
this
new
hampshire
paraphernalia
had
been
taken
into
new
york
and
some
how
used
in
a
way
which
violated
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
the
statute
might
reach
it
but
the
--
by
the
answer
of
the
bill
of
particulars
that's
out
of
the
case
since
the
government
does
not
suggest
that
this
paraphernalia
was
used
in
any
way
which
violated
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
or
any
other
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
is
that
the
--
suggest
that
if
you
don't
prevail
here
that
you'll
discontinue
its
use
and
just
go
on
with
the
sweepstakes,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap),
it
is
--
it
is
possible
isn't
it
to
visualize
these
set
of
facts
under
which
these
acknowledgements
would
be
paraphernalia
of
a
gambling
pool,
for
example,
suppose
mr.
fabrizio
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
a
lot
of
75
people
which
they
--
mr.
fabrizio
is
delegated
to
go
to
new
hampshire
and
buy
75
tickets.
he
brings
back
and
the
--
and
it
--
there
he
puts
various
names
on
them
or
suppose
he
signs
his
name
as
trustee
or
agent
for
the
betting
pool.
suppose
he
says
fabrizio,
agent
for
the
betting
pool
and
he
brings
back
those
acknowledgements
into
new
york
state,
he
deposits
some
in
a
safe
place
and
all
this
people
have
shares
in
that
pool.
now
there
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
--
it'd
be
possible
that
united
states
or
it
framed
the
indictment
could
indict
fabrizio
under
this
statute.
say,
that
he
used
the
acknowledgements
as
paraphernalia
for
betting
a
pool.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
more
that
probably
i
don't
think
i'd
go
to
new
hampshire
and
put
$6
in
your
machine
and
not
have
something
to
show
that
i
put
$6
in
your
machine
i
might
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
no
it
isn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
--
the
reason
for
that
is
i
want
to
have
something
to
show
that
i
put
$6.00
into
your
machine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
did
i
misunderstand
mr.
chapman,
i
thought
he
said
this
as
reference
to
which
you're
saying
before
lunch
that
each
of
your
2-3
million
tourists
might
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
statute
merely
form
carrying
back
one
of
these
acknowledgements
to
take
home
state?
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
chapman
say,
did
i
not,
that
statute
would
not
reach
your
tourist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
they
sell
the
ticket
itself
in
a
state
in
violation
of
state
laws?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
the
actual
ticket,
that's
the
paraphernalia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
that
--
because
the
certificate
does
have
some
use
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
connection
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
if
somebody
is
--
i
think
mr.
chapman
told
us
did
he
not
that
efforts
have
been
made
to
have
express
--
amendments
expressly
excluding
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.

has

william
j.
brennan,

no,

i'm

of
exceptions

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
favor
of
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
justice
william
j.

did
the

sponsor
those?

william

no

may
