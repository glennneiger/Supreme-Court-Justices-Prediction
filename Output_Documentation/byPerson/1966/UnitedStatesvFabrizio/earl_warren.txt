mr.

chief

if
i
don't
have
to
present
that,
what
do
they
have
to
present
to
get
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
have
to
show
the
bank
in
order
to
get
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chapman.
mrs.
friedlander.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
though
--
isn't
that
--
hasn't
it
been
a
great
activity
of
organized
criminals
for
instance
to
try
to
use
the
bookmaking
operations
of
one
state
in
which
it's
legal
all
over
the
united

and
the
states
have
done
nothing
to
prevent
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
would
it
be
fantastic
to
think
that
the
same
thing
could
develop
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
this
--
suppose
this
man
had
set
up
a
business
in
new
york
whereby
he
invited
people
to
come
there
and
he
would
act
as
a
broker
for
them
to
participate
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
he
did
a
big
business,
it
can
be
done
you
know.
this
could
be
done.
let
me
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
just
finish
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
as
an
incident
of
that
business
he
used
these
certificates
that
are
in
this
case.
how
would
that
be
any
different
from
the
situation
where
he
would
use
the
sports
betting
pools
in
nevada
which
are
legal
to
set
up
the
same
thing
in
other
states
based
upon
the
nevada
rule
which
is
legal
in
nevada?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
what
would
be
the
distinction
between
those
two
operations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
this
man
entered
into
a
business,
brokers
business
in
new
york
and
carried
these
certificates
back
into
new
york
to
convince
his
--
these
people
that
he
had
invested
their
money
in
the
sweepstakes
and
that
they
would
therefore
get
their
money
if
they
want,
wouldn't
that
be
the
same
as
carrying
the
gambling
operation
in
nevada
into
another
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
this
--
the
indictment
does
say
that
he's
carried
these
certificates
into
new
york
to
be
used
and
adapted,
devised
and
designed
for
use
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now,
why
wouldn't
the
government
be
entitled
to
prove
under
an
indictment
of
that
kind
that
it
was
illegal?
maybe
it
wasn't
and
the
man
would
be
acquitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
he'd
be
convicted
and
it
would
have
to
be
reversed
because
there
was
no
evidence
but
under
that
allegation
why
couldn't,
why
couldn't
the
government
prove
that
this
man
did
want
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
your
judgment
but
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
ask
for
that
information
on
your
request
for
a
bill
of
particulars.
all
you
asked
for
was
the
records
and
documents.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
only
be
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
only
be
so
if
this
act
applied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
i
understand
you
then
that
to
say
that
even
if
the
government
showed
that
this
man
was
taking
these
certificates
into
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
illegally
conducting
a
brokerage
in
new
york
based
upon
this
sweepstakes
that
there
would
be
no
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time
but
just
one
more
question,
is
it
then
your
position
that
the
carrying
of
the
--
taking
these
certificates
into
another
state
cannot
be
illegal
regardless
of
the
use
that
they're
put
to
in
the
other
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
--
it
is
your
position
that
it
is
within
the
statute
because
it
is
illegal
--
of
legal
advance
in
new
hampshire
and
that
therefore
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
new
hampshire
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
get
down
to
the
question
then
that
under
no
circumstances
whether
its
in
organized
crime
or
not
that
the
person
in
the
position
of
mr.
fabrizio
is
in
that
under
no
circumstances
can
this
statute
be
applied
to
the
sweepstakes
of
new
hampshire
because
it
is
legal
in
new
hampshire
and
new
hampshire
is
one
of
the
sovereign
states,
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
then
the
same
reasoning
it
would
not
apply
to
the
irish
sweepstakes
or
to
the
puerto
rico
sweepstakes
or
the
sweepstakes
of
any
foreign
country
that
wanted
to
come
in
here
in
that
manner
if,
if
there,
the
sweepstakes
was
legal
at
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
the
puerto
rican
sweepstakes
and
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
put
that
on
tenth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
put
that
on
the
tenth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
use
gambling
in
any
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
millimet.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
give
them,
to
the
purchaser
for,
they
have
no
value,
no
importance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
the
government
is
under
indictment
either.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
the
government
of
new
hampshire
is
not
under
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
let
me
ask
you,
is
you
position
exactly
the
same
as
mrs.
friedlander
who
represent
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
before
you
change
the
subject
that
your
great
concern
is
whether
this
2
or
3
million
visitors
who
come
to
your
state
are
precluded
from
buying
your
tickets
because
of
the
danger
of
their
being
arrested
if
--
by
the
government
if
they
carry
the
certificate
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
situation,
would
the
--
would
the
state
of
new
hampshire
have
any
great
concern
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
be
for
their
clients
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
--
does
it,
what
i
mean,
that
you
would
like
to
spread
it
like
you
say
the
irish
sweepstakes
do.
you'd
like
to
have
a
set
up
in
every
state
where
the
--
where
these
things
can
be
sold
for
what
they're
worth.
i
mean,
it
might
not
be
worth
anything
to
you
but
they
--
they
will
--
they'll
be
worth
a
lot
to
the
people
who
were
buying
from
a
broker
in
another
state
if
their
number
happened
to
come
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
like
to
say
those
are
established
all
over
the
country
to
finance
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
it
seems
to
me
that
it'd
be
very
simple
if
that's
--
if
this
is
all
that's
involved
in
it
and
the
certificate
means
absolutely
nothing
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire
or
to
the
operation
that
is
in
question
here,
you
just
abandon
that
and
that
--
and
the
--
do
it
all
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
get
away
from
this
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
about
outside
of
the
state?
do
you
care
how
many
they
buy
if
they're
are
outside
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
in
--
i
mean
is
there
anything
in
this
form
that
they
fill
out
that
they
live
outside
of
the
state
that
would
restrict
them
as
to
the
numbers
they
can
buy
and
do
you
regulate
that
to
see
that
they
don't
buy
more
than
would
be
reasonable
in
buying
for
friends
or
neighbors
or
family?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chapman,
i'd
like
to
tell
you
your
time
is
up
but
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
as
i
--
has
to
repeat
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
about
whether
one
person
who
bought
a
ticket
or
two
tickets
and
so
forth
would
then
--
and
left
the
state
with
these
certificates
would
be
under
the
act
whether
it
would,
are
you
--
or
counsels
reply,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
will
you
try
to
straight
this
out
by
--
and
give
us
one
answer
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
are
there
any
prosecutions
for
violation
of
the
same
--
the
same
law
under
the
irish
sweepstakes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
counsel
just
told
us
about
how
its
publish
in
the
papers
that
they're
--
i
think
you
4,000
people
in
this
country
who
are
winners
in
a
certain
drawing
of
the
irish
sweepstakes
that
must
mean
that
there
maybe
millions
of
those
things
sold
in
this
country
by
--
why
wouldn't
the
government
be
interested
in
that
as
well
as
in
this
drawing
or
lottery
or
sweepstakes
of
new
hampshire?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
didn't
they--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--talk
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
been
going
on
for
year
long
before
the
new
hampshire
affair.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
very
strange
that
it
a
--
have
this
one
prosecution
for
a
fellow
with
75
tickets
and
the
newspaper
show
that
4,000
winners
in
one
drawing
of
the
irish
sweepstakes
in
this
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
no
concern
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
sending
us
a
little
memorandum
in
the
next
day
or
so
as
to
how
many
prosecutions
there
have
been
in
--
by
the
government
in
the
last
lets
say
in
the
last
five
years
on
irish
sweepstakes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
that
difficult
to
find
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
or
would
be
interesting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
have
to
be
very
brief
because
your
time
is
up
and
we
have
extended
quite
a
bit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
state
them
briefly
then.

if

don't

what

chief

it's

yes.
chief

yes.
chief

well,
if

entered

chief

well,
that's
your

that's
--
chief

earl
warren
you
didn't
ask

all
you

was

chief

(inaudible)
chief

i
don't

just
one

is

your

whether
its

that
manner
if,
if
there,
the
sweepstakes
was
legal
at
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
the
puerto
rican
sweepstakes
and
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
put
that
on
tenth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
put
that
on
the
tenth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
use
gambling
in
any
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
millimet.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
give
them,
to
the
purchaser
for,
they
have
no
value,
no
importance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
the
government
is
under
indictment
either.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
the
government
of
new
hampshire
is
not
under
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
let
me
ask
you,
is
you
position
exactly
the
same
as
mrs.
friedlander
who
represent
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
before
you
change
the
subject
that
your
great
concern
is
whether
this
2
or
3
million
visitors
who
come
to
your
state
are
precluded
from
buying
your
tickets
because
of
the
danger
of
their
being
arrested
if
--
by
the
government
if
they
carry
the
certificate
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
situation,
would
the
--
would
the
state
of
new
hampshire
have
any
great
concern
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
be
for
their
clients
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
--
does
it,
what
i
mean,
that
you
would
like
to
spread
it
like
you
say
the
irish
sweepstakes
do.
you'd
like
to
have
a
set
up
in
every
state
where
the
--
where
these
things
can
be
sold
for
what
they're
worth.
i
mean,
it
might
not
be
worth
anything
to
you
but
they
--
they
will
--
they'll
be
worth
a
lot
to
the
people
who
were
buying
from
a
broker
in
another
state
if
their
number
happened
to
come
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
like
to
say
those
are
established
all
over
the
country
to
finance
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
it
seems
to
me
that
it'd
be
very
simple
if
that's
--
if
this
is
all
that's
involved
in
it
and
the
certificate
means
absolutely
nothing
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire
or
to
the
operation
that
is
in
question
here,
you
just
abandon
that
and
that
--
and
the
--
do
it
all
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
get
away
from
this
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
about
outside
of
the
state?
do
you
care
how
many
they
buy
if
they're
are
outside
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
in
--
i
mean
is
there
anything
in
this
form
that
they
fill
out
that
they
live
outside
of
the
state
that
would
restrict
them
as
to
the
numbers
they
can
buy
and
do
you
regulate
that
to
see
that
they
don't
buy
more
than
would
be
reasonable
in
buying
for
friends
or
neighbors
or
family?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chapman,
i'd
like
to
tell
you
your
time
is
up
but
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
as
i
--
has
to
repeat
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
about
whether
one
person
who
bought
a
ticket
or
two
tickets
and
so
forth
would
then
--
and
left
the
state
with
these
certificates
would
be
under
the
act
whether
it
would,
are
you
--
or
counsels
reply,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
will
you
try
to
straight
this
out
by
--
and
give
us
one
answer
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
are
there
any
prosecutions
for
violation
of
the
same
--
the
same
law
under
the
irish
sweepstakes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
counsel
just
told
us
about
how
its
publish
in
the
papers
that
they're
--
i
think
you
4,000
people
in
this
country
who
are
winners
in
a
certain
drawing
of
the
irish
sweepstakes
that
must
mean
that
there
maybe
millions
of
those
things
sold
in
this
country
by
--
why
wouldn't
the
government
be
interested
in
that
as
well
as
in
this
drawing
or
lottery
or
sweepstakes
of
new
hampshire?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
didn't
they--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--talk
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
been
going
on
for
year
long
before
the
new
hampshire
affair.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
very
strange
that
it
a
--
have
this
one
prosecution
for
a
fellow
with
75
tickets
and
the
newspaper
show
that
4,000
winners
in
one
drawing
of
the
irish
sweepstakes
in
this
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
no
concern
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
sending
us
a
little
memorandum
in
the
next
day
or
so
as
to
how
many
prosecutions
there
have
been
in
--
by
the
government
in
the
last
lets
say
in
the
last
five
years
on
irish
sweepstakes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
that
difficult
to
find
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
or
would
be
interesting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
have
to
be
very
brief
because
your
time
is
up
and
we
have
extended
quite
a
bit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
state
them
briefly
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
very
well.
