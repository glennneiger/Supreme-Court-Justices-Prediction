ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
understand
the
original
concession
made
by
the
government
at
the
commencement
of
this
argument
is
--
he
seem
to
say
that
an
individual
who
did
what
this
indictment
charge,
that
is
a
person
who
--
a
non-resident
who
goes
to
new
hampshire,
purchases
his
sweepstakes
and
returns
with
the
ticket
does
not
violate
the
statute.
and
he
seems
to
have
conceded
that
this
indictment
does
not
violate
the
statute.
nevertheless,
he
says
that
if
an
additional
wagering
purpose
is
shown
at
the
trial
of
this
case
then
in
that
event
the
indictment
is
sufficient.
now
i
think
procedurally
the
court
should
understand
that
the
government
appears
to
have
conceded
that
this
indictment
as
it
is
read
in
any
reasonable
normal
common
sense
way
is
not
sufficient
to
charge
a
crime
as
the
district
court
held.
at
the
--
after
the
indictment
was
returned
there
was
a
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
made.
the
government
came
forth
alleging
no
other
violation
of
federal,
state
or
local
law
and
nearly
again
reiterated
their
claim
that
the
defendant
carried
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
interstate
commerce.
then
we
have
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
again,
no
other
facts
such
you
say
are
now
alleging
are
presented
to
the
district
court
where
possibly
a
decision
could
be
made
on
them,
possibly
a
motion
to
amend
the
bill
of
particulars
could
be
made
sovereigns
from
the
government
until
they
argue
in
the
brief
in
this
court
that
there
is
additional
prejudicial
conduct
which
is
really
not
relevant
to
this
indictment.
the
statute
says
anybody
who
carries
wagering
paraphernalia
proscribed
by
the
statute
in
interstate
commerce
violates
the
statute.
that's
what
the
indictment
charged.
so
that
any
wagering
para
--
conduct
which
this
defendant,
this
appellee
may
have
been
guilty
of
is
not
a
violation
of
section
1953
and
the
government
is
talking
about
something
else.
and
if
they
are
talking
about
something
else
then
it
be
whom
--
the
government
to
move
for
another
indictment.
and
i
think
on
the
basis
of
this
very
--
this
--
what
i
understood
to
be
tantamount
to
a
concession
or
there's
--
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
below.
there
is
no
grounds
for
to
them
to
show
any
other
fact.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
the
motion
--
the
request
--
the
demands
of
the
bill
of
particulars
is
as
follows:
defendant
moves
this
court
for
an
order
directing
the
united
states
of
america
to
file
and
start
upon
the
dependent
of
bill
of
particulars
to
the
following
matters.
embraced
within
the
indictment;
1.)
set
forth
in
detail
all
records,
papers
and
writings.
it
will
be
claimed
that
defendant
knowingly
carried
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
section
1953
of
title
18
u.s.
code.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
the
--
paragraph
two
set
forth
any
and
all
violations
of
any
state
laws,
ordinances
or
rules
that
the
united
states
of
america
will
claim
the
defendant
violated.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
and
that
is
all.
along
the
basis
of
this
failure
to
move
to
amend
this
bill
of
particulars
if
they
had
an
additional
evidence
to
show
and
also
on
the
basis
of
the
really
threshold
fact
that
under
this
indictment
there
is
no
more
to
show
other
than
that
he
carried
this
paraphernalia
in
interstate
commerce.
there's
grounds
here
for
an
affirmance.
now
since
the
government
has
made
the
argument
that
new
hampshire
is
within
this
statute
i
am
going
to
very
briefly
point
out
to
the
court
the
legislative
background
in
which
this
statute
was
passed.
this
statute
was
passed
in
response
to
a
modern
problem
of
organized
crime
which
had
infiltrated
governments
at
the
local
and
state
level.
it
was
multi-state.
it
was
a
web,
a
design,
a
pattern
of
illegal
business
activities
which
the
states
were
unable
to
pierce.
in
response
to
this
specific
problem
of
organized,
illegal
organized
activity,
these
statutes
were
passed.
now,
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
we
are
talking
here
about
activity
which
is
conducted
by
a
stock
sovereign
state
as
has
been
mentioned.
and
the
fact
of
its
being
conducted
by
a
sovereign
state
precludes
the
possibility
of
its
being
the
kind
of
wagering
pool
within
the
statute.
the
government
is
using
a
sort
of
in
terrorem
approach
here
and
claiming
that
if
we
permit
new
hampshire
to
be
not
within
the
coverage
of
this
statute
that
states
will
be
inundated
with
illegal
wagering
paraphernalia.
in
order
for
such
a
thing
to
take
place
you
would
have
to
assume
an
absurd
example
that
a
state
is
a
renegade
and
will
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
a
sister
state
inundate
the
state
with
its
own
wagering
paraphernalia.
this
is
an
absurd
example
to
justify
the
absurd
conclusion
that
the
judge
--
the
government
is
asking
for
here.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well
because
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
believe
what
your
honor
is
pointing
out
is
a
situation
where
a
legal
event
has
been
misused
by
organized
racketeers
that
they
could
take
the
trappings
of
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
carry
on
perhaps
some
illegal
related
activity
in
another
state.
and
the
answer
is
that
if
they
do,
they
are
definitely
within
the
statute
because
that
is
no
longer
the
wagering
paraphernalia
of
new
hampshire.
but
they
are
using
it
to
another
illegal
use
and
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
yes.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
yes.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
your
honor
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
there
is
no
distinction
between
an
illegal
use
of
legal
state
gambling
paraphernalia.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
anybody
can
take
what
is
legal
in
one
state
and
misuse
it
in
some
way
to
his
own
profit
in
another
state
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
but
also
in
misuse
of
the
paraphernalia
of
the
state.
in
other
words
it
is
not
the
state
that
is
shipping
out
this
paraphernalia
to
be
used
illegally.
but
it
is
people
outside
of
the
operation
of
new
hampshire
who
are
using
it
illegally.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
and
this
pattern
of
statute
was
definitely
designed
to
cover
the
situation
where
you
are
talking
about
illegal
organized
criminal
kind
of
gambling
conduct.
and
it
would
be
covered
but
not
because
it's
new
hampshire
who
is
shipping
it
but
because
somebody
is
misusing
the
new
hampshire
paraphernalia.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well,
your
honor
as
i
say
i
think
it
would
be
and
i
think
an
indictment
which
alleged
specifically
enough
to
inform
the
defendant
of
what
he's
being
charged
with
that
he
carried
paraphernalia
to
nevada,
or
new
hampshire
or
whatever
it
may
be
in
interstate
commerce
to
be
used
in
the
manner
in
which
you
are
suggesting
not
only
he
can
be
covered
under
other
federal
statutes
of
related
statutes
such
as
1952,
which
is
any
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
in
furtherance
of
an
illegal
business
activity
such
as
gambling.
so
that
i
don't
think
we
have
problems
where
a
legal
state
event
is
perverted
to
the
use
of
illegal
operators.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
the
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
would
say
that
the
government
couldn't
prove
it
why.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
yes
your
honor,
because
it's
based
on
rules
of
procedure.
one,
the
government
couldn't
prove
it
because
they
have
failed
to
allege
the
conduct
which
makes
out
the
crime.
and
the
requirement
of
the
indictment
is
that
you
inform
the
defendant
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
crime
with
which
he's
charged.
two,
when
you
are
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars
you
must
show
the
defendant
the
evidence
which
he
is
going
to
be
called
upon
to
prove.
neither
of
which
this
indictment
or
this
bill
of
particulars
does.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
and
we
asked
if
any
violation
of
state
law
was
being
charged
and
the
government
said
that
there
was
no
violation
of
state
law
charged
and
of
course
what
you're
suggesting
is
a
violation
of
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
--
new
york
law.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well,
that's
the
ultimate
question,
that's
true.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
when
we
talk
about
what
you
have
to
prove
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
think
the
rules
of
indictments
and
proof
of
trial
demand
that
the
defense
counsel
and
that
the
defendant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
know
what
he
is
going
to
be
faced
with.
another
requirement,
another
requirement
for
the
bill
of
particulars
to
be
specific
and
for
the
indictment
is
that
the
district
court
may
make
a
knowledgeable
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
or
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
we
have
here.
in
which
case
we
would
avoid
multiple
appeals
such
as
if
your
honors'
view
prevails,
we
would
be
faced
with.
the
--
that's
the
reason
why
they
have
to
allege
this
specifically.
now
i
do
not
concede
your
honor
that
this
indictment
which
charges
that
he
carried
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
interstate
commerce
permits
the
government
without
our
rules
of
procedure
and
what
we
know
is
fair
and
what
criminal
procedure
requires
such
as
fundamental
fairness.
i
do
not
concede
it
permits
the
government
to
show
other
wagering
conduct.
this
statute
prohibits
the
trap
--
the
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
proscribed
wagering
paraphernalia.
it
says
nothing
about
making
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
it.
it
says
nothing
about
letting
other
people
stay
in
new
york
and
going
to
new
hampshire
to
do
something.
it
forbids
the
shipment
of
this
paraphernalia
and
the
crime
is
made
out
when
you
shipped
it
and
nothing
could
be
more
clear
than
this
indictment
that
that
is
what
they
charged
as
they
claim
in
the
statutory
language.
now
to
slip
in
and
added
subtlety,
look
we
try
--
we
say
that
you're
carrying
this
in
interstate
commerce
but
when
you
come
to
trial
we're
going
to
show
that
you
actually
were
making
money
on
this
thing.
this
--
this
violates
sense
of
fairness
without
any
knowledge
of
criminal
procedure.
it
also
is
not
consistent
with
the
reading
of
the
statute
and
what
the
indictment
charges
the
defendant.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
they
would
not
your
honor
because
a
brokerage
or
selling
for
profit
is
not
a
wagering
pool
and
it
is
not
a
bookmaking
and
it
is
not
numbers
policy
of
the
leader.
he
may
be
--
this
is
a
separate
conduct
which
is
not
wagering
pool.
not
the
paraphernalia
of
wagering
pools.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
it
is
out
position
that
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
are
not
within
the
statute
and
that
the
mere
carriage
in
interstate
commerce
of
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
event
does
not
violate
the
statute
if
new
hampshire
isn't
within
the
statute.
and
if
you
alleged
that
somebody
is
carrying
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
event.
i
can
only
see
that
what
else
he
does
with
it
is
irrelevant
to
that
charge.
now
it
may
be
another
charged.
it
may
be
1952.
he
may
be
conducting
his
own
wagering
pool
with
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
which
is
not
to
be
use
in
a
wager
--
new
hampshire
wagering
event
but
to
be
used
in
his
own
wagering
pool.
you
see
the
new
hampshire
event
in
that
case
would
be
the
mechanism
or
his
trappings
whereby
he
carries
really
his
own
wagering
pool.
so
i
do
not
feel
that
selling
for
profit
is
what
this
statute
was
getting
at.
it
carrying
--
proscribed
wagering
paraphernalia
and
new
hampshire
as
our
view
is
definitely
not
within
the
statute.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
that
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
but
more
than
being
legal
in
new
hampshire
it
is
conducted
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
it
is
conducted
by
a
sovereign
state
of
the
united
states
and
that
congress
had
no
intent
to
impeach
this
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
your
honor
i
believe
that
it
doesn't
state
our
position
exclusively.
we
say
that
under
the
facts
as
mr.
fabrizio
is
alleged
to
be
doing
that
this
private
gain
on
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
does
not
violate
the
indictment
which
he
is
faced
with.
now
you
--
you
can
--
can
see
as
i've
said,
you
can
misuse
the
new
hampshire
event
under
1953.
you
are
only
covering
the
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
wagering
paraphernalia,
wagering
paraphernalia
to
carry
on
a
prohibited
activity.
that's
all
the
statute
covers.
now
we
say
that
if
you
carry
on
--
if
you
transmit
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
which
are
going
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
event
not
in
any
other
private
wagering
pool
or
any
other
gambling
conduct
within
the
statute
then
it's
not
covered.
the
statute
doesn't
cover
selling
for
profit,
the
carry
--
the
statute
only
covers
shipment
of
gambling
paraphernalia,
that's
the
basic
purpose
of
it.
they
did
not
want
organized
racketeers
to
take
both
shipments
of
things
that
where
with
all
to
carry
on
their
activities
and
ship
it
in
interstate
commerce
which
they
were
doing.
that's
what
this
specific
purpose
of
this
statute,
that's
all
it
covers.
now
there's
another
statute,
there's
1952
and
there
congress
said,
"look,
we
know
that
you've
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
and
you
are
carrying
on
your
illegal
gambling
activities."
"it
may
be
you're
making
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
a
new
hampshire
event
or
you
may
be
doing
all
kinds
of
illegal
gambling
activity."
"when
you
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
carry
on
your
own
illegal
gambling
activity,
1952
would
apply."
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
cause
to
expand
what
1953
was
designed
to
cover
which
was
just
the
shipment
of
paraphernalia.
and
that
was
all
it
was
designed
to
cover
merely
because
the
other
conduct
is
illegal
which
is
a
familiar
principle.
it
sounds
as
if
we
want
to
punish
him
for
it
but
this
particular
statute
was
not
meant
to
be
used
for
this
purpose.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
oh,
your
honor
i
--
we
do
not
take
that
position.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
there
is
a
difference
between
the
state
and
the
union
and
a
--
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
there's
a
difference
between
the
deference
which
one
state
owes
to
another
state
which
are
constitutionally
requires
deference
to
the
laws
of
another
state.
there
is
a
built
in
system
of
behavior
between
states
that
we
can
rely
on.
now
we
can't
rely
on
what
another
does
for
example
new
hampshire,
pardon
me,
ireland
is
what
i'm
calling
a
renegade
state.
i
mean,
they
are
soliciting
the
sale
of
irish
sweepstakes
ticket
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
--
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
point
that
we
are
saying
irish
sweepstakes
is
all
right,
or
the
tahiti
sweepstakes
is
all
right.
we
are
only
saying
that
when
a
state,
a
sovereign
state
conducts
its
own
legal
sweepstakes
that
congress
did
not
intent
to
reach
that
conduct.
the
point
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
pardon?
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well
this
would
be
one
objection
if
congress
did
intend
to
reach
that
conduct
but
i
think
it's
not
required
that
we
get
to
any
constitutional
principle
for
it.
they
simply
were
very
cautious
about
not
getting
in
to
this
as
in
the
exemptions,
the
patterns
of
exemptions
show.
so
when
congress
--
when
we
talked

ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
do
not
your
honor,
that's
the
point
i
wish
to
make.
i
think
congress
could
have
the
power.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
think
congress
could
stop
all
gambling
if
it
wished
to
do
but
this
was
a
sophisticated
congress.
we're
not
talking
about
1895,
if
the
government
is
doing
about
a
moralizing
congress
which
was
trying
to
legislate
against
gambling.
we're
talking
about
sophisticated
people
at
the
time
of
the
package
of
--
within
very
recent
times,
new
york,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
stated
in
their
--
by
a
judge
of
the
court
in
its
opinion.
we
do
not
hold
a
gambling
such
as
the
irish
sweepstakes
and
the
new
hampshire
event
to
be
proscribed
and
the
irish
sweepstakes
are
illegal.
yet
it
is
a
sophisticated
attitude
that
we
took
to
gambling.
but
of
course
there's
no
sophisticated
attitude
that
one
would
take
to
organize
racketeering.
brief
time
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
words
of
the
statute
are
very
clear.
they're
address
to
numbers,
they're
addressed
to
policy,
illegal
bookmaking
and
the
wagering
pools
which
are
not
as
the
government
suggest
a
wagering
pool
of
the
sovereign
state
with
the
trappings
of
the
pari-mutuel
race
track
and
all
the
aura
of
legality
and
commonly
participated
in
fun.
they're
talking
about
the
kind
of
gambling
where
you
go
into
the
back
room
and
where
you
bet
illegally
and
everybody
who
does
this
knows
he
is
doing
something
illegal
and
you'd
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
would
your
honor,
the
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
oh,
we
have
prepared
an
appendix
for
our
brief
which
is
replete
with
the
quotations
from
the
hearings
both
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house
and
i
have
prepared
just
a
very
brief
little
list
here
of
the
kinds
of
words
which
are
a
total
--
saturation
one
might
say
of
the
legislative
hearings.
hoodlums,
racketeers,
syndicates,
numbers
rackets,
number
sellers,
flash
paper,
lets
keep
step
with
the
criminal
element,
huge
profits
in
traffic,
liquor,
narcotics,
prostitution,
kingpins,
(inaudible),
henchmen,
underlings,
messengers.
this
is
the
kind
of
things
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
they
use
gambling
qualified
always
by
this
long
exhaustive
list
of
operators.
now
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
that's
exactly
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
that's
exactly
point
--
our
disc
--
the
decision
of
this
court
of
affirmance
is
a
narrow
thing.
it
applies
to
an
event
conducted
by
a
state.
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
nevada
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i'm
sorry
you
honor,
i
don't
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
agree,
i
think
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
there's
nothing
affirmative,
the
portions
of
new
hampshire
as
we
have
pointed
out
was
none
existence
but
i
think
it
is
inferable
from
the
caution
for
the
other
state
permitted
conduct
which
was
given
deference
in
every
statute
passed
at
that
time
and
also
from
the
coverage
which
was
totally
concentrated
on
the
illegal
gambling
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
they
are
your
honor,
they
are
regulate
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
exactly.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
think
it's
persuasive
because
of
--
the
pari-mutuel
is
where
illegal
in
half
the
state
and
they
still
gave
it
total
exemption.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
exactly
by
the
bill
of
particulars
in
the
indictment.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
understand
the
original
concession
made
by
the
government
at
the
commencement
of
this
argument
is
--
he
seem
to
say
that
an
individual
who
did
what
this
indictment
charge,
that
is
a
person
who
--
a
non-resident
who
goes
to
new
hampshire,
purchases
his
sweepstakes
and
returns
with
the
ticket
does
not
violate
the
statute.
and
he
seems
to
have
conceded
that
this
indictment
does
not
violate
the
statute.
nevertheless,
he
says
that
if
an
additional
wagering
purpose
is
shown
at
the
trial
of
this
case
then
in
that
event
the
indictment
is
sufficient.
now
i
think
procedurally
the
court
should
understand
that
the
government
appears
to
have
conceded
that
this
indictment
as
it
is
read
in
any
reasonable
normal
common
sense
way
is
not
sufficient
to
charge
a
crime
as
the
district
court
held.
at
the
--
after
the
indictment
was
returned
there
was
a
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
made.
the
government
came
forth
alleging
no
other
violation
of
federal,
state
or
local
law
and
nearly
again
reiterated
their
claim
that
the
defendant
carried
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
interstate
commerce.
then
we
have
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
again,
no
other
facts
such
you
say
are
now
alleging
are
presented
to
the
district
court
where
possibly
a
decision
could
be
made
on
them,
possibly
a
motion
to
amend
the
bill
of
particulars
could
be
made
sovereigns
from
the
government
until
they
argue
in
the
brief
in
this
court
that
there
is
additional
prejudicial
conduct
which
is
really
not
relevant
to
this
indictment.
the
statute
says
anybody
who
carries
wagering
paraphernalia
proscribed
by
the
statute
in
interstate
commerce
violates
the
statute.
that's
what
the
indictment
charged.
so
that
any
wagering
para
--
conduct
which
this
defendant,
this
appellee
may
have
been
guilty
of
is
not
a
violation
of
section
1953
and
the
government
is
talking
about
something
else.
and
if
they
are
talking
about
something
else
then
it
be
whom
--
the
government
to
move
for
another
indictment.
and
i
think
on
the
basis
of
this
very
--
this
--
what
i
understood
to
be
tantamount
to
a
concession
or
there's
--
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
below.
there
is
no
grounds
for
to
them
to
show
any
other
fact.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
the
motion
--
the
request
--
the
demands
of
the
bill
of
particulars
is
as
follows:
defendant
moves
this
court
for
an
order
directing
the
united
states
of
america
to
file
and
start
upon
the
dependent
of
bill
of
particulars
to
the
following
matters.
embraced
within
the
indictment;
1.)
set
forth
in
detail
all
records,
papers
and
writings.
it
will
be
claimed
that
defendant
knowingly
carried
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
section
1953
of
title
18
u.s.
code.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
the
--
paragraph
two
set
forth
any
and
all
violations
of
any
state
laws,
ordinances
or
rules
that
the
united
states
of
america
will
claim
the
defendant
violated.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
and
that
is
all.
along
the
basis
of
this
failure
to
move
to
amend
this
bill
of
particulars
if
they
had
an
additional
evidence
to
show
and
also
on
the
basis
of
the
really
threshold
fact
that
under
this
indictment
there
is
no
more
to
show
other
than
that
he
carried
this
paraphernalia
in
interstate
commerce.
there's
grounds
here
for
an
affirmance.
now
since
the
government
has
made
the
argument
that
new
hampshire
is
within
this
statute
i
am
going
to
very
briefly
point
out
to
the
court
the
legislative
background
in
which
this
statute
was
passed.
this
statute
was
passed
in
response
to
a
modern
problem
of
organized
crime
which
had
infiltrated
governments
at
the
local
and
state
level.
it
was
multi-state.
it
was
a
web,
a
design,
a
pattern
of
illegal
business
activities
which
the
states
were
unable
to
pierce.
in
response
to
this
specific
problem
of
organized,
illegal
organized
activity,
these
statutes
were
passed.
now,
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
we
are
talking
here
about
activity
which
is
conducted
by
a
stock
sovereign
state
as
has
been
mentioned.
and
the
fact
of
its
being
conducted
by
a
sovereign
state
precludes
the
possibility
of
its
being
the
kind
of
wagering
pool
within
the
statute.
the
government
is
using
a
sort
of
in
terrorem
approach
here
and
claiming
that
if
we
permit
new
hampshire
to
be
not
within
the
coverage
of
this
statute
that
states
will
be
inundated
with
illegal
wagering
paraphernalia.
in
order
for
such
a
thing
to
take
place
you
would
have
to
assume
an
absurd
example
that
a
state
is
a
renegade
and
will
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
a
sister
state
inundate
the
state
with
its
own
wagering
paraphernalia.
this
is
an
absurd
example
to
justify
the
absurd
conclusion
that
the
judge
--
the
government
is
asking
for
here.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well
because
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
believe
what
your
honor
is
pointing
out
is
a
situation
where
a
legal
event
has
been
misused
by
organized
racketeers
that
they
could
take
the
trappings
of
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
carry
on
perhaps
some
illegal
related
activity
in
another
state.
and
the
answer
is
that
if
they
do,
they
are
definitely
within
the
statute
because
that
is
no
longer
the
wagering
paraphernalia
of
new
hampshire.
but
they
are
using
it
to
another
illegal
use
and
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
yes.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
yes.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
your
honor
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
there
is
no
distinction
between
an
illegal
use
of
legal
state
gambling
paraphernalia.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
anybody
can
take
what
is
legal
in
one
state
and
misuse
it
in
some
way
to
his
own
profit
in
another
state
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
but
also
in
misuse
of
the
paraphernalia
of
the
state.
in
other
words
it
is
not
the
state
that
is
shipping
out
this
paraphernalia
to
be
used
illegally.
but
it
is
people
outside
of
the
operation
of
new
hampshire
who
are
using
it
illegally.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
and
this
pattern
of
statute
was
definitely
designed
to
cover
the
situation
where
you
are
talking
about
illegal
organized
criminal
kind
of
gambling
conduct.
and
it
would
be
covered
but
not
because
it's
new
hampshire
who
is
shipping
it
but
because
somebody
is
misusing
the
new
hampshire
paraphernalia.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well,
your
honor
as
i
say
i
think
it
would
be
and
i
think
an
indictment
which
alleged
specifically
enough
to
inform
the
defendant
of
what
he's
being
charged
with
that
he
carried
paraphernalia
to
nevada,
or
new
hampshire
or
whatever
it
may
be
in
interstate
commerce
to
be
used
in
the
manner
in
which
you
are
suggesting
not
only
he
can
be
covered
under
other
federal
statutes
of
related
statutes
such
as
1952,
which
is
any
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
in
furtherance
of
an
illegal
business
activity
such
as
gambling.
so
that
i
don't
think
we
have
problems
where
a
legal
state
event
is
perverted
to
the
use
of
illegal
operators.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
the
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
would
say
that
the
government
couldn't
prove
it
why.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
yes
your
honor,
because
it's
based
on
rules
of
procedure.
one,
the
government
couldn't
prove
it
because
they
have
failed
to
allege
the
conduct
which
makes
out
the
crime.
and
the
requirement
of
the
indictment
is
that
you
inform
the
defendant
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
crime
with
which
he's
charged.
two,
when
you
are
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars
you
must
show
the
defendant
the
evidence
which
he
is
going
to
be
called
upon
to
prove.
neither
of
which
this
indictment
or
this
bill
of
particulars
does.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
and
we
asked
if
any
violation
of
state
law
was
being
charged
and
the
government
said
that
there
was
no
violation
of
state
law
charged
and
of
course
what
you're
suggesting
is
a
violation
of
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
--
new
york
law.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well,
that's
the
ultimate
question,
that's
true.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
when
we
talk
about
what
you
have
to
prove
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
think
the
rules
of
indictments
and
proof
of
trial
demand
that
the
defense
counsel
and
that
the
defendant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
know
what
he
is
going
to
be
faced
with.
another
requirement,
another
requirement
for
the
bill
of
particulars
to
be
specific
and
for
the
indictment
is
that
the
district
court
may
make
a
knowledgeable
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
or
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
we
have
here.
in
which
case
we
would
avoid
multiple
appeals
such
as
if
your
honors'
view
prevails,
we
would
be
faced
with.
the
--
that's
the
reason
why
they
have
to
allege
this
specifically.
now
i
do
not
concede
your
honor
that
this
indictment
which
charges
that
he
carried
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
interstate
commerce
permits
the
government
without
our
rules
of
procedure
and
what
we
know
is
fair
and
what
criminal
procedure
requires
such
as
fundamental
fairness.
i
do
not
concede
it
permits
the
government
to
show
other
wagering
conduct.
this
statute
prohibits
the
trap
--
the
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
proscribed
wagering
paraphernalia.
it
says
nothing
about
making
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
it.
it
says
nothing
about
letting
other
people
stay
in
new
york
and
going
to
new
hampshire
to
do
something.
it
forbids
the
shipment
of
this
paraphernalia
and
the
crime
is
made
out
when
you
shipped
it
and
nothing
could
be
more
clear
than
this
indictment
that
that
is
what
they
charged
as
they
claim
in
the
statutory
language.
now
to
slip
in
and
added
subtlety,
look
we
try
--
we
say
that
you're
carrying
this
in
interstate
commerce
but
when
you
come
to
trial
we're
going
to
show
that
you
actually
were
making
money
on
this
thing.
this
--
this
violates
sense
of
fairness
without
any
knowledge
of
criminal
procedure.
it
also
is
not
consistent
with
the
reading
of
the
statute
and
what
the
indictment
charges
the
defendant.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
they
would
not
your
honor
because
a
brokerage
or
selling
for
profit
is
not
a
wagering
pool
and
it
is
not
a
bookmaking
and
it
is
not
numbers
policy
of
the
leader.
he
may
be
--
this
is
a
separate
conduct
which
is
not
wagering
pool.
not
the
paraphernalia
of
wagering
pools.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
it
is
out
position
that
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
are
not
within
the
statute
and
that
the
mere
carriage
in
interstate
commerce
of
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
event
does
not
violate
the
statute
if
new
hampshire
isn't
within
the
statute.
and
if
you
alleged
that
somebody
is
carrying
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
event.
i
can
only
see
that
what
else
he
does
with
it
is
irrelevant
to
that
charge.
now
it
may
be
another
charged.
it
may
be
1952.
he
may
be
conducting
his
own
wagering
pool
with
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
which
is
not
to
be
use
in
a
wager
--
new
hampshire
wagering
event
but
to
be
used
in
his
own
wagering
pool.
you
see
the
new
hampshire
event
in
that
case
would
be
the
mechanism
or
his
trappings
whereby
he
carries
really
his
own
wagering
pool.
so
i
do
not
feel
that
selling
for
profit
is
what
this
statute
was
getting
at.
it
carrying
--
proscribed
wagering
paraphernalia
and
new
hampshire
as
our
view
is
definitely
not
within
the
statute.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
that
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
but
more
than
being
legal
in
new
hampshire
it
is
conducted
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
it
is
conducted
by
a
sovereign
state
of
the
united
states
and
that
congress
had
no
intent
to
impeach
this
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
your
honor
i
believe
that
it
doesn't
state
our
position
exclusively.
we
say
that
under
the
facts
as
mr.
fabrizio
is
alleged
to
be
doing
that
this
private
gain
on
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
does
not
violate
the
indictment
which
he
is
faced
with.
now
you
--
you
can
--
can
see
as
i've
said,
you
can
misuse
the
new
hampshire
event
under
1953.
you
are
only
covering
the
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
wagering
paraphernalia,
wagering
paraphernalia
to
carry
on
a
prohibited
activity.
that's
all
the
statute
covers.
now
we
say
that
if
you
carry
on
--
if
you
transmit
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
which
are
going
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
event
not
in
any
other
private
wagering
pool
or
any
other
gambling
conduct
within
the
statute
then
it's
not
covered.
the
statute
doesn't
cover
selling
for
profit,
the
carry
--
the
statute
only
covers
shipment
of
gambling
paraphernalia,
that's
the
basic
purpose
of
it.
they
did
not
want
organized
racketeers
to
take
both
shipments
of
things
that
where
with
all
to
carry
on
their
activities
and
ship
it
in
interstate
commerce
which
they
were
doing.
that's
what
this
specific
purpose
of
this
statute,
that's
all
it
covers.
now
there's
another
statute,
there's
1952
and
there
congress
said,
"look,
we
know
that
you've
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
and
you
are
carrying
on
your
illegal
gambling
activities."
"it
may
be
you're
making
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
a
new
hampshire
event
or
you
may
be
doing
all
kinds
of
illegal
gambling
activity."
"when
you
travel
in
interstate
commerce
to
carry
on
your
own
illegal
gambling
activity,
1952
would
apply."
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
cause
to
expand
what
1953
was
designed
to
cover
which
was
just
the
shipment
of
paraphernalia.
and
that
was
all
it
was
designed
to
cover
merely
because
the
other
conduct
is
illegal
which
is
a
familiar
principle.
it
sounds
as
if
we
want
to
punish
him
for
it
but
this
particular
statute
was
not
meant
to
be
used
for
this
purpose.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
oh,
your
honor
i
--
we
do
not
take
that
position.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
there
is
a
difference
between
the
state
and
the
union
and
a
--
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
there's
a
difference
between
the
deference
which
one
state
owes
to
another
state
which
are
constitutionally
requires
deference
to
the
laws
of
another
state.
there
is
a
built
in
system
of
behavior
between
states
that
we
can
rely
on.
now
we
can't
rely
on
what
another
does
for
example
new
hampshire,
pardon
me,
ireland
is
what
i'm
calling
a
renegade
state.
i
mean,
they
are
soliciting
the
sale
of
irish
sweepstakes
ticket
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
--
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
point
that
we
are
saying
irish
sweepstakes
is
all
right,
or
the
tahiti
sweepstakes
is
all
right.
we
are
only
saying
that
when
a
state,
a
sovereign
state
conducts
its
own
legal
sweepstakes
that
congress
did
not
intent
to
reach
that
conduct.
the
point
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
pardon?
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
well
this
would
be
one
objection
if
congress
did
intend
to
reach
that
conduct
but
i
think
it's
not
required
that
we
get
to
any
constitutional
principle
for
it.
they
simply
were
very
cautious
about
not
getting
in
to
this
as
in
the
exemptions,
the
patterns
of
exemptions
show.
so
when
congress
--
when
we
talked
about
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
do
not
your
honor,
that's
the
point
i
wish
to
make.
i
think
congress
could
have
the
power.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
think
congress
could
stop
all
gambling
if
it
wished
to
do
but
this
was
a
sophisticated
congress.
we're
not
talking
about
1895,
if
the
government
is
doing
about
a
moralizing
congress
which
was
trying
to
legislate
against
gambling.
we're
talking
about
sophisticated
people
at
the
time
of
the
package
of
--
within
very
recent
times,
new
york,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
stated
in
their
--
by
a
judge
of
the
court
in
its
opinion.
we
do
not
hold
a
gambling
such
as
the
irish
sweepstakes
and
the
new
hampshire
event
to
be
proscribed
and
the
irish
sweepstakes
are
illegal.
yet
it
is
a
sophisticated
attitude
that
we
took
to
gambling.
but
of
course
there's
no
sophisticated
attitude
that
one
would
take
to
organize
racketeering.
brief
time
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
words
of
the
statute
are
very
clear.
they're
address
to
numbers,
they're
addressed
to
policy,
illegal
bookmaking
and
the
wagering
pools
which
are
not
as
the
government
suggest
a
wagering
pool
of
the
sovereign
state
with
the
trappings
of
the
pari-mutuel
race
track
and
all
the
aura
of
legality
and
commonly
participated
in
fun.
they're
talking
about
the
kind
of
gambling
where
you
go
into
the
back
room
and
where
you
bet
illegally
and
everybody
who
does
this
knows
he
is
doing
something
illegal
and
you'd
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
would
your
honor,
the
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
oh,
we
have
prepared
an
appendix
for
our
brief
which
is
replete
with
the
quotations
from
the
hearings
both
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house
and
i
have
prepared
just
a
very
brief
little
list
here
of
the
kinds
of
words
which
are
a
total
--
saturation
one
might
say
of
the
legislative
hearings.
hoodlums,
racketeers,
syndicates,
numbers
rackets,
number
sellers,
flash
paper,
lets
keep
step
with
the
criminal
element,
huge
profits
in
traffic,
liquor,
narcotics,
prostitution,
kingpins,
(inaudible),
henchmen,
underlings,
messengers.
this
is
the
kind
of
things
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
they
use
gambling
qualified
always
by
this
long
exhaustive
list
of
operators.
now
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
that's
exactly
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
that's
exactly
point
--
our
disc
--
the
decision
of
this
court
of
affirmance
is
a
narrow
thing.
it
applies
to
an
event
conducted
by
a
state.
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
nevada
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i'm
sorry
you
honor,
i
don't
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
agree,
i
think
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
there's
nothing
affirmative,
the
portions
of
new
hampshire
as
we
have
pointed
out
was
none
existence
but
i
think
it
is
inferable
from
the
caution
for
the
other
state
permitted
conduct
which
was
given
deference
in
every
statute
passed
at
that
time
and
also
from
the
coverage
which
was
totally
concentrated
on
the
illegal
gambling
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
they
are
your
honor,
they
are
regulate
--
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
exactly.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
i
think
it's
persuasive
because
of
--
the
pari-mutuel
is
where
illegal
in
half
the
state
and
they
still
gave
it
total
exemption.
ms.
betty
d.
friedlander
exactly
by
the
bill
of
particulars
in
the
indictment.
