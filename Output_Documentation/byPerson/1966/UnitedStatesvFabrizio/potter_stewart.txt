how
about
--
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
new
hampshire
itself
makes
it
illegal
for
somebody
to
engage
in
the
business
of
doing
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(voice

not
only
in
relation
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
this
statute
--
the
federal
statute
was
enacted
long
before
the
new
hampshire
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
was
not
in
existence
at
that
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
--
well,
since
i've
now
interrupted
you,
i
--
you're
--
you
have
been
directing
yourself
during
the
last
few
minutes
to
the
policy
arguments
in
support
of
your
position.
are
you
meaning
to
suggest
with
a
straight
face
that
congress
would
have
made
the
sovereign
state
of
new
hampshire's
state
operated
lottery
subject
to
this
law
if
it
--
if
this
--
if
the
lottery
had
been
in
existence
at
the
time
enacted
if
this
law?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
just
legal
in
the
area,
this
is
run
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
raise
state
revenue.
justice
potter
stewart
operated
by
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
a
unique
--
it's
the
one
of
the
50
states
which
operates
a
lottery.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

a
part
of
it
--
as
a
part
of
the
internal
revenue
system.
justice
potter
stewart
not
under
the
new
hampshire
system,
not
the
way
it's
operated,
could
there
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
only
protects
itself,
it
protects
the
other
states,
doesn't
it
because
so
far
as
new
hampshire's
concern
this
so
--
this
acknowledgment
has
no
function
at
all
in
the
sweepstakes.
the
buyer
can
take
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
tear
it
up
and
he
still
has
--
his
name
and
address
are
still
inside
that
machine.
this
acknowledgement
has
no
function
at
all
and
everything
stays
within
the
borders
of
the
state
of
a
new
hampshire
because
it
stays
inside
that
machine
after
you've
purchased
that
ticket,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
says
so
right
on
its
face--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
in
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
only
the
acknowledgment
of
purchase.
it
need
not
be
retained
or
presented
for
payment.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
can
--
write
your
ticket
and
pay
your
$3
and
this
acknowledgment
comes
out
of
the
machine
you
can
tear
it
up
and
you
have
no
greater
or
no
less
interest
in
or
possibility
of
winning
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
he's
having
this
in
his
pocket
or
in
his
sloughs
when
he
crosses
the
state
line,
that's
the
only
possible
federal
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
not
making
any
arrangements
with
people
in
new
york
state?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
as
i
understood
you
finally
to
answer
my
brother
fortas'
questions
to
say
that
the
proscribed
purpose
was
the
new
hampshire's
sweepstakes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
having
nothing
to
do
with
these
arrangements
that
he
made
with
his
customers
in
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
understand
your
contention.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
though
how
just
one
more
time.
i
--
the
large
--
more
than
50%
of
these
sweepstakes
ticket
are
bought
by
out
of

they?

mr.
millimet,
getting
back
to
the
statutory
language,
i
had
understood
that
the
critical
words
for
interpretation
here
were,
what
--
it
was
the
phrase,
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
mrs.
friedlander
i
think
had
directed
herself
to
that
phrase
and
said
that
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
properly
considered
was
not
within
that
statutory
definition,
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
because
it
was
a
state
adopted
operation
and
as
i
understand
you
now,
you're
directing
our
intention
rather
to
another
part
of
the
statute
that
is,
any

paraphernalia,
tickets,

i
understand
you
correctly

certainly
it
is

you
mean
even
