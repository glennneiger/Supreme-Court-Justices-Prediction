mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
hampshire
is
here
for
the
very
reason
that
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
have
laid
mainly
because
this
indictment
read
as
any
ordinary
person
would
read
it
could
be
applied
to
any
tourist
who
travels
to
new
hampshire,
buy
sweepstakes
tickets
and
takes
the
acknowledgments
back
with
him.
the
indictment
does
not
raise
the
issues
which
the
government
argues
in
its
brief.
and
unless
i
misread
borden
and
all
the
subsequent
cases
the
government
cannot
so
construe
the
indictment
here.
now,
the
government
seems
to
take
the
positions
that
they
can
construe
this
indictment
differently
from
the
way
it
was
necessarily
construed
by
the
district
court.
i
don't
understand
the
rule
that
way.
i
understand
that
the
only
issue
raised
on
an
appeal
under
section
3731
is
whether
or
not
the
construction
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
district
court
is
correct
and
that
this
court
has
said
in
its
own
opinions
on
numerous
occasions
that
it
will
be
bound
by
the
construction
placed
on
the
indictment.
now
the
only
construction
that
could
be
placed
on
the
indictment
on
this
record
is
the
construction
which
is
a
dumbgraded
by
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
here
namely
if
the
government
shows
nothing
more
than
this
indictment
alleges,
is
it
a
violation
of
the
statute?
and
this
offends
the
state
of
new
hampshire
because
it
would
mean
that
the
2
or
3
million
tourists
who
come
to
new
hampshire
every
year
and
who
constitute
the
principal
source
of
our
revenue
for
this
educational
program
would
be
subject
to
indictment
under
this
statute
and
we
don't
believe
that
was
the
intention
of
congress.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
government
can
take
the
position
here
that
it
does
under
the
decided
cases.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no
sir,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
should
be
subject
to
indictment
if
they
had
--
if
they
took
them
back
to
there
home
states
with
them
because
i
do
not
believe
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
would
have
grave
doubt
about
it,
yes
sir.
then
i
will
explain
why.
i
think
that
the
sovereign
state
of
new
hampshire
has
every
right
under
the
constitution
to
decide
to
raise
funds
for
its
legitimate
governmental
purposes
within
its
own
borders
in
any
way
it
chooses
so
long
as
in
doing
so
it
does
not
offend
the
paramount
powers
of
the
federal
constitution
or
violate
the
laws
of
its
sister
states.
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
manner
in
which
we
have
setup
the
operation
of
our
sweepstakes
satisfies
both
those
requirements
and
i
take
it
purely
on
a
statutory
analysis.
section
1953
certainly
purports
to
prohibit
the
carriage
in
interstate
commerce
of
wagering
paraphernalia
which
is
in
some
way
use,
useful
etcetera
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
various
proscribed
and
very
narrowly
limited
activities.
now
those
particular
activities,
the
legislative
history
shows
are
all
activities
which
are
concerned
with
crime
and
racketeering
and
other
source
of
the
principle
bankroll
for
a
crime
in
this
country.
the
only
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
that
the
government
points
its
finger
at
in
this
case
below,
on
appeal
and
the
brief
on
oral
argument
is
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
they
don't
point
at
any
other
wagering
pool
as
mrs.
friedlander
said
in
her
argument.
even
what
they're
saying
about
mr.
fabrizio
which
i
think
they
have
no
right
to
say
here,
in
what
they're
saying
about
him
doesn't
create
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
the
only
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
that
the
government
is
talking
about
is
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
now
the
paraphernalia,
there
must
be
something
to
give
congress
power
and
they
purported
to
act
on
the
interstate
commerce
power
to
give
congress
power
in
this
situation.
they
have
to
show
that
the
wagering
pool,
that
the
paraphernalia
which
is
carried
in
interstate
commerce
is
in
some
way
a
part
of
it,
operative
part
of
the
wagering
pool
in
such
a
way
that
its
carried
in
interstate
commerce
is
within
the
commerce
control
power
of
congress
or
that
it
offends
the
laws
of
some
other
state.
now
that
hasn't
been
shown
here
and
we
believe
that
at
least
so
far
as
congress
is
concern
and
the
commerce
power
is
concern
it
couldn't
be
shown.
because
these
acknowledgements
of
purchase,
once
they
get
into
the
hands
of
the
consumer
are
no
longer
paraphernalia.
paraphernalia
is
the
means
by
which
a
wagering
pool
is
conducted,
that's
what
congress
was
aiming
at.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
that's
an
excellent
question
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
thats
--
and
i
would
say
frankly
to
this
court
that
we
give
it
to
the
people
be
--
for
psychological
reasons.
we
give
it
to
the
people
because
it's
a
souvenir.
it's
a
memento,
its
something.
it's
a
piece
of
paper
they
can
look
at
after
they
pay
their
$3.
that's
the
only
reason
we
give
it
to
them.
it
has
no
function
whatsoever.
we
have
operated
our
sweepstakes
program
now
on
three
successive
years.
we
have
never
required
anybody
to
produce
this
piece
of
paper.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
wagering
apparatus
once
it
passes
to
the
consumer's
hands
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concern.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well
i'm
sorry
sir,
but
i
don't
control
the
legislature.
i
was
legislative
counsel
for
the
governor
but
i
don't
control
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
and
i
really
cannot
answer
that
question
fairly.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
agree
wholeheartedly
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
couldn't
state
it
as
plainly
myself
your
honor,
yes
sir.
then
they
would
be
pointing
at
a
wagering
pool
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
would
be
in
fact
be
illegal
and
would
be
in
fact
be
within
the
terms
of
this
statute
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
they
would
indeed
sir.
and
that
is
a
perfectly
permissible
use
of
the
statute
but
that
is
not
this
indictment.
and
it
is
not
even
the
construction
of
this
indictment
which
the
government
seeks
to
place
on
it
now
in
this
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
would
not
say
sir
that
they
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
wagering.
certainly
the
acknowledgements
have
something
to
do
with
wagering
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
want
it
because
we
wanted
to
give
something
to
the
customer.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
probably
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
reason
for
that
your
honor
is
that
you're
a
law
abiding
citizen.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
people
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
think
a
--
i
think
i
can
only
say
your
honor
that
millions
of
dollars
are
wagered
everyday
with
bookmakers
and
people
have
nothing
to
show
for
it.
i
think
the
difference
between
persons
who
bet
with
bookmakers
and
persons
who
buy
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
is
that
we
appeal
to
the
ordinary
tourist.
that's
what
the
program
is
aimed
at.
that's
the
way
we
set
it
up.
that's
why
we
give
the
ordinary
tourist
something
to
look
at
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
make
the
ordinary
tourist
a
criminal.
thus
the
government
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it
helps
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
its
certainly
is
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
it
is
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
it
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
congress
intended
to
prevent
us
from
doing
that
and
the
government
doesn't
claim
and
has
never
claimed
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
have
every
right
in
the
world
to
operate
the
sweepstakes
program
exactly
the
way
we
operate
it.
every
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no,
the
government
isn't
trying
to
stop
it.
the
government
claims
that
they're
trying
to
stop
somebody
from
latching
onto
it
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
oh,
no
sir,
i'm
sorry
sir.
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
doing
anything
improper.
the
government
never
has
claimed
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
doing
anything
improper.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
government
has
never
said
we
can't
do
this,
this
way.
they
don't
say
it
here
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
not
under
indictment
in
any
way.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no,
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well,
our
position
--
because
we
represent
the
state
is
a
little
bit
different
in
that
we
are
concerned,
it
--
in
essence
it
comes
to
the
same
thing,
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that
quickly.
but
we
are
concerned
that
reading
this
indictment
and
if
this
indictment
were
upheld
under
the
narrow
rules
of
appeals
under
section
3731,
every
tourist
who
come
to
new
hampshire
will
happen
to
put
one
of
our
acknowledgement,
is
in
his
pocket
would
be
in
jeopardy
and
we
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
meant.
we
say
that
the
statute
was
never
intended
for
that.
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
the
government's
point
here
that
this
statute
is
in
some
way
an
extension
or
an
amendment
of
section
1301
which
we
admit
applies
to
the
new
hampshire
program.
section
1301
was
enacted
in
1895
because
the
state
of
louisiana
was
flooding
the
united
states
with
tickets,
sweepstakes
--
not
sweepstakes
ticket,
lottery
tickets
which
could
be
bought
and
sold
and
battered
all
over
the
country
and
it
--
the
statute
admittedly
applies
to
our
operation
and
the
reason,
the
reason
why
we
originally
device
this
particular
piece
of
paper,
as
an
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
black's
question,
the
reason
why
we
devise
this
particular
piece
of
paper
and
put
on
it
this
acknowledgement
is
not
necessary
to
present
for
a
prize
and
so
forth
was
that
we
know
that
section
1301
applied
to
us
and
we
didn't
want
our
tourist
purchasers
to
be
returning
to
their
homes
with
pieces
of
paper
which
plainly
would
violate
section
1301.
that's
the
reason
why
we
made
the
acknowledgement
up
in
the
form
that
we
made
it
up.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
1301
is
a
statute
which
is
designed
particularly
to
prohibit
lotteries.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
thank
you
your
honor.
just
before
the
noon
recess,
there
was
a
question
concerning
the
relationship
between
section
1301
of
title
18
and
section1953
under
which
indictment
is
brought.
now
the
government
in
its
brief
and
implicitly
in
its
argument
here
seems
to
take
the
position
that
1953
is
just
an
extension
of
1301
and
that
since
the
state
of
new
hampshire
admits
that
section
1301
applies
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes,
therefore
1953
applies.
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
the
legislative
history
of
course
demonstrates
that
1953
was
concerned
with
an
entirely
differently
problem.
this
has
been
briefed
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
we
point
out
that
the
louisiana
lottery
against
which
1301
was
specifically
directed
was
flooding
the
country
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
sweepstakes
--
lottery
tickets.
but
quite
aside
from
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
to
the
court
the
fact
that
as
far
as
1301
is
concern
and
as
far
as
1953
also
is
concern
the
state
of
new
hampshire
could
run
a
lottery
and
give
out
pieces
of
paper
equivalent
to
its
acknowledgements
here
and
the
government
would
not
contend
and
could
not
contend
that
it
was
covered
by
1953.
1953
was
tailor
made
for
the
specific
type
of
organized
gambling
activity
that
the
justice
department
was
aiming
at.
and
it
is
required
as
the
government
admits
in
its
argument
that
one
of
the
elements
which
must
be
shown
is
that
there
is
a
piece
of
paraphernalia
associated
with
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now
an
ordinary
lottery
doesn't
involving
--
doesn't
involve
a
sporting
event
at
all.
so
that
if
we
were
running
an
ordinary
lottery
we
wouldn't
be
here,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
under
the
government's
own
position
and
for
them
to
say
that
1953
is
simply
an
amendment
or
an
extension
of
1301.
its
completely
at
variance
not
only
with
the
legislative
history
but
also
with
any
fair
analysis
of
the
statute.
now
the
other
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
first
time
he
answered
the
question,
he
said
it
would.
and
the
second
time
he
answered
the
question,
i
think
he
said
he
would
have
to
show
something
more.
and
i
think
the
difficulty
is
that
mr.
fabrizio
in
this
record
is
a
tourist
and
that's
why
i
think
the
government
answers
the
question
both
ways.
we
--
of
course
we
say
that
it
doesn't
reach
anybody
in
the
position
of
a
tourist
and
on
this
record
mr.
fabrizio
is
a
tourist.
i
would
like
to
say
also
that
new
hampshire
went
to
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
and
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
structure
its
sweepstakes
program
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
would
we
not
offend
the
federal
law
but
we
would
not
offend
the
state
laws.
we
went
out
of
our
way
to
avoid
the
problem
that
existed
in
the
louisiana
lottery
and
that
exist
today
if
i
may
say
so,
in
the
irish
sweepstakes
which
is
an
abomination
to
the
--
to
this
statute.
the
irish
sweepstakes
violates
this
statute
everyday
of
the
week.
two
weeks
ago
when
this
case
was
scheduled
for
argument
there
were
four
thousand
names
printed
in
the
boston
press
of
persons
who
won
prizes
in
the
irish
sweepstakes
and
everyone
of
those
persons
violated
--
acquired
the
sweepstakes
tickets
illegally
because
an
article
in
fortune
this
month,
the
november
fortune
points
out,
the
irish
sweepstakes
has
a
systematic
way
of
violating
the
statute
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government
this
nation
and
yet
they
don't
get
prosecuted.
now
naturally
the
state
of
new
hampshire
was
offended
at
this
situation.
we
have
gone
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
that
very
problem.
we
do
not
ship
in
interstate
commerce.
we
do
not
release
to
any
one
a
single
blank
ticket
that
can
be
taken
elsewhere
and
sold.
we
do
not
ship
books
of
tickets
in
interstate
commerce,
that's
wagering
paraphernalia
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
if
we
were
to
release
books
of
tickets
in
our
liquor
stores
and
let
people
come
there
and
buy
them
and
return
the
counter
foils
the
way
they
do
with
the
irish
sweepstakes,
we'd
sell
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
of
these
tickets.
the
state
of
new
hampshire
would
run
its
whole
education
program
with
the
proceeds
because
the
irish
sweepstakes
take
30
millions
of
dollars
out
of
the
united
states
every
year
by
doing
just
that,
but
that
is
a
violation
is
section
1953.
that
would
be
shipping
in
interstate
commerce,
carrying
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it's
because
they
permit
their
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
sir
of
paraphernalia
which
is
an
intrical
operative
part
of
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
our
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it's
--
the
actual
ticket
sir
or
any
--
it's
more
than
the
tickets,
it's
the
books
of
tickets,
it's
the
counter
foil,
it's
the
devices
by
which
their
sweepstakes
is
carry
on.
the
devices
by
which
our
sweepstakes
is
carried
on
never
leave
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
that's
why
we
only
sell
$6
million
worth
at
our
best
year.
that's
why
--
because
we
have
to
depend
upon
tourism
to
get
--
to
get
the
customers
and
it's
because
we
have
exercised
this
kind
of
restraint
that
we
feel
that
the
government
is
in
error
in
bringing
this
indictment.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
you
understand
me
correctly
but
i
certainly
support
everything
which
mrs.
friedlander
had
said.
i
think
there
are
dual
grounds
why
this
statute
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
the
new
hampshire
operation
at
all
in
the
abstract
for
the
reasons
mrs.
friedlander
gives.
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
new
hampshire
operation
as
structured
that
is
to
say
as
it
is
described
in
the
record
here
for
the
reason
that
i
give
in
addition
to
the
reasons
that
mrs.
friedlander
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
because
the
statute
merely
proscribes
carriage
of
the
paraphernalia
in
interstate
commerce
in
connection
with
the
wagering
pool
and
the
wagering
pool
so
far
as
the
wagering
pool
is
concern
its
all
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
the
person
--
this
is
why
the
tourist
is
not
covered,
he
is
not
carrying
paraphernalia.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
carrying
a
piece
of
paper,
yes
he
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir,
but
that
is
not
what
the
statute
--
the
--
as
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions,
the
meaning
of
words
is
largely
determined
by
the
purpose
of
congress.
and
it
is
our
position
in
the
brief
and
here
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
reach
the
person
and
the
paraphernalia
which
was
being
circulated
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
sporting
events
as
those
things
are
understood
in
the
manner
mrs.
friedlander
described
them,
illegal
operations,
football
pools,
the
typical
thing
as
a
football
pool.
there's
even
some
doubt
in
my
mind
whether
this
is
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
don't
have
to
come
to
that
because
of
these
other
reasons.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes,
there
would
be
some
doubt
in
my
mind
because
typically
a
wagering
pool
that
they're
talking
about
in
the
history
here
is
the
football
pool
where
you
have
some
elements
of
choice
and
so
on.
whereas
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
ordinary
lotteries
as
i
said
before
plainly
doesn't
apply
to
ordinary
lotteries.
it
apples
to
number,
and
it
applies
to
(inaudible)
but
those
things
as
shown
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
miller
takes
351
of
the
house
hearings
are
specified
things.
they're
terms
of
art,
they're
known
to
the
underworld,
they're
known
to
the
justice
department
and
they're
specific
things.
all
of
the
things
enumerated
in
this
statute
are
specific
things
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
comes
within
by
any
analysis
of
this
statute.
but
as
i
say,
we
don't
feel
we
have
to
come
to
that
because
of
the
two
reasons
that
we
give,
that
it
was
certainly
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
apply
this
particular
statute
to
a
lawful
operation.
and
i'd
like
to
say
in
that
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well,
we
are
also
concern
that
people
who
--
we
--
people
who
purchase
tickets
for
others
should
be
permitted
to
take
them
back.
we
have
a
program
in
new
hampshire
whereby
we
invite
people
to
purchase
sweepstakes
ticket
as
presents
for
their
friends
and
relatives
and
neighbors.
and
we
would
be
greatly
concerned
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
would
have
no
objection
to
their
buying
them
for
their
clients.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no
we
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no
sir,
we
have
never
intended
our
program
to
operate
in
that
manner.
we
do
not
seek
--
we
do
not
have
that
ambition
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
utterly
improper
under
the
laws
of
about
37
to
40
of
the
respective
states
and
that
is
not
what
we
seek
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
simply
seek
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well
we
don't
think
the
problem
exists.
it
didn't
exist
until
the
government
brought
this
case
and
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor
we
don't
think
that's
a
practical
way
to
run
a
sweepstakes
operation.
we
simply
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
of
course
it
does.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
(inaudible)
of
course
it
does
your
honor.
as
i
said
it's
a
psychological
thing
you
have
meet
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
that
--
well,
there,
the
tax,
we
were
excuse
from
the
wagering
tax
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
--
which
as
you
know
is
also
regulatory.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
was
a
bill
introduced
to
permit
us
to
use
the
mails
which
is
something
else.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
not
--
the
bill
is
not
directed
to
section
1953
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
has
been
a
proposal
of
that
kind.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
in
the
congress
to
permit
--
that
there's
been
a
number
of
proposals
to
have
national
lotteries
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
has
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
has
been
a
proposal.
it
was
introduced.
it's
never
been
heard
in
committee.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it
has
--
it
was
introduced
by
one
of
our
senators
but
it
has
not
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
proposal
was
to
exempt
state
operated
--
the
sweepstakes
programs
from
the
limitations
of
section
1302.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir,
it's
as
to
the
mails.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no,
we
never
thought
it
applied.
we've
taken
this
position
consistently
with
the
justice
department
from
the
day
the
bill
was
signed
that
1953
didn't
apply
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
program.
and
i'd
simply
like
to
close
by
saying
that
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
a
state
operated
program
such
as
ours
where
by
everything
that
has
to
be
done
has
to
be
done
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
any
other
kind
of
lottery
or
sweepstakes
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
we
have
adopted
out
program
to
what
has
happened
to
the
united
states.
we
are
simply
doing
--
we
are
simply
selling
tickets
to
people
who
move
about,
the
mobility
of
our
population.
we're
not
sending
tickets
into
other
states,
we're
just
relying
on
the
fact
that
there
are
2
or
3
million
tourist
who
come
to
the
state
and
its
just
like
for
that
matter
just
like
a
pari-mutuel
program
but
i
might
say
much
less,
much
more
innocuous.
it's
a
simple
thing.
you
buy
a
$3
ticket
you
don't
go
to
the
window
and
from
a
moral
point
of
view
and
bet
and
bet
and
double
your
bet
and
seek
to
get
your
money
back.
it's
a
simple
innocuous
thing
based
on
the
circumstances
of
our
society.
that's
all
it
is
and
we
have
not
in
any
way
flooded
the
county.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
there's
a
limit,
you
can
--
have
to
go
to
a
special
place
to
buy
more
than
10
and
we
keep
tracks
of
the
names
of
people
who
buy
more
that
10.
we
make
them
fill
out
a
form
so
that
if
any
body
undertakes
the
setup
an
illegal
operation,
we
will
have
the
evidence.
and
we
have
cooperated
with
the
justice
department
in
prosecuting
two
persons
who
sought
to
setup
a
sales
agency
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
the
use
of
the
mail.
we've
done
everything
we
can
in
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
--
we'd
certainly
do.
no
one
can
buy
anything
from
the
state
of
new
hampshire
except
inside
the
state.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
have
no
rule
about
how
many
they
can
buy
but
we
make
them
identify
themselves.
in
other
words
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
--
they
can't
just
put
down
a
100
different
names
not
their
own.
we
make
them
put
down
their
own
name
when
they
buy
tickets
in
bulk
so
we
know
who
they
are.
and
if
they
come
back
time
after
time
doing
this
we
will
know
that
their
violating
or
at
least
we
would
think
that
there
are
violating
are
own
statute
which
prohibits
the
making
of
a
profit
on
the
purchase
and
sale
of
our
tickets
and
we
have
a
system
for
doing
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
hampshire
is
here
for
the
very
reason
that
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
have
laid
mainly
because
this
indictment
read
as
any
ordinary
person
would
read
it
could
be
applied
to
any
tourist
who
travels
to
new
hampshire,
buy
sweepstakes
tickets
and
takes
the
acknowledgments
back
with
him.
the
indictment
does
not
raise
the
issues
which
the
government
argues
in
its
brief.
and
unless
i
misread
borden
and
all
the
subsequent
cases
the
government
cannot
so
construe
the
indictment
here.
now,
the
government
seems
to
take
the
positions
that
they
can
construe
this
indictment
differently
from
the
way
it
was
necessarily
construed
by
the
district
court.
i
don't
understand
the
rule
that
way.
i
understand
that
the
only
issue
raised
on
an
appeal
under
section
3731
is
whether
or
not
the
construction
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
district
court
is
correct
and
that
this
court
has
said
in
its
own
opinions
on
numerous
occasions
that
it
will
be
bound
by
the
construction
placed
on
the
indictment.
now
the
only
construction
that
could
be
placed
on
the
indictment
on
this
record
is
the
construction
which
is
a
dumbgraded
by
the
questions
which
had
been
asked
here
namely
if
the
government
shows
nothing
more
than
this
indictment
alleges,
is
it
a
violation
of
the
statute?
and
this
offends
the
state
of
new
hampshire
because
it
would
mean
that
the
2
or
3
million
tourists
who
come
to
new
hampshire
every
year
and
who
constitute
the
principal
source
of
our
revenue
for
this
educational
program
would
be
subject
to
indictment
under
this
statute
and
we
don't
believe
that
was
the
intention
of
congress.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
government
can
take
the
position
here
that
it
does
under
the
decided
cases.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no
sir,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
should
be
subject
to
indictment
if
they
had
--
if
they
took
them
back
to
there
home
states
with
them
because
i
do
not
believe
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
would
have
grave
doubt
about
it,
yes
sir.
then
i
will
explain
why.
i
think
that
the
sovereign
state
of
new
hampshire
has
every
right
under
the
constitution
to
decide
to
raise
funds
for
its
legitimate
governmental
purposes
within
its
own
borders
in
any
way
it
chooses
so
long
as
in
doing
so
it
does
not
offend
the
paramount
powers
of
the
federal
constitution
or
violate
the
laws
of
its
sister
states.
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
manner
in
which
we
have
setup
the
operation
of
our
sweepstakes
satisfies
both
those
requirements
and
i
take
it
purely
on
a
statutory
analysis.
section
1953
certainly
purports
to
prohibit
the
carriage
in
interstate
commerce
of
wagering
paraphernalia
which
is
in
some
way
use,
useful
etcetera
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
various
proscribed
and
very
narrowly
limited
activities.
now
those
particular
activities,
the
legislative
history
shows
are
all
activities
which
are
concerned
with
crime
and
racketeering
and
other
source
of
the
principle
bankroll
for
a
crime
in
this
country.
the
only
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
that
the
government
points
its
finger
at
in
this
case
below,
on
appeal
and
the
brief
on
oral
argument
is
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
they
don't
point
at
any
other
wagering
pool
as
mrs.
friedlander
said
in
her
argument.
even
what
they're
saying
about
mr.
fabrizio
which
i
think
they
have
no
right
to
say
here,
in
what
they're
saying
about
him
doesn't
create
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
the
only
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
that
the
government
is
talking
about
is
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
now
the
paraphernalia,
there
must
be
something
to
give
congress
power
and
they
purported
to
act
on
the
interstate
commerce
power
to
give
congress
power
in
this
situation.
they
have
to
show
that
the
wagering
pool,
that
the
paraphernalia
which
is
carried
in
interstate
commerce
is
in
some
way
a
part
of
it,
operative
part
of
the
wagering
pool
in
such
a
way
that
its
carried
in
interstate
commerce
is
within
the
commerce
control
power
of
congress
or
that
it
offends
the
laws
of
some
other
state.
now
that
hasn't
been
shown
here
and
we
believe
that
at
least
so
far
as
congress
is
concern
and
the
commerce
power
is
concern
it
couldn't
be
shown.
because
these
acknowledgements
of
purchase,
once
they
get
into
the
hands
of
the
consumer
are
no
longer
paraphernalia.
paraphernalia
is
the
means
by
which
a
wagering
pool
is
conducted,
that's
what
congress
was
aiming
at.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
that's
an
excellent
question
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
thats
--
and
i
would
say
frankly
to
this
court
that
we
give
it
to
the
people
be
--
for
psychological
reasons.
we
give
it
to
the
people
because
it's
a
souvenir.
it's
a
memento,
its
something.
it's
a
piece
of
paper
they
can
look
at
after
they
pay
their
$3.
that's
the
only
reason
we
give
it
to
them.
it
has
no
function
whatsoever.
we
have
operated
our
sweepstakes
program
now
on
three
successive
years.
we
have
never
required
anybody
to
produce
this
piece
of
paper.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
wagering
apparatus
once
it
passes
to
the
consumer's
hands
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concern.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well
i'm
sorry
sir,
but
i
don't
control
the
legislature.
i
was
legislative
counsel
for
the
governor
but
i
don't
control
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
and
i
really
cannot
answer
that
question
fairly.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
agree
wholeheartedly
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
couldn't
state
it
as
plainly
myself
your
honor,
yes
sir.
then
they
would
be
pointing
at
a
wagering
pool
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
would
be
in
fact
be
illegal
and
would
be
in
fact
be
within
the
terms
of
this
statute
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
they
would
indeed
sir.
and
that
is
a
perfectly
permissible
use
of
the
statute
but
that
is
not
this
indictment.
and
it
is
not
even
the
construction
of
this
indictment
which
the
government
seeks
to
place
on
it
now
in
this
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
would
not
say
sir
that
they
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
wagering.
certainly
the
acknowledgements
have
something
to
do
with
wagering
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
want
it
because
we
wanted
to
give
something
to
the
customer.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
probably
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
reason
for
that
your
honor
is
that
you're
a
law
abiding
citizen.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
people
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
think
a
--
i
think
i
can
only
say
your
honor
that
millions
of
dollars
are
wagered
everyday
with
bookmakers
and
people
have
nothing
to
show
for
it.
i
think
the
difference
between
persons
who
bet
with
bookmakers
and
persons
who
buy
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
is
that
we
appeal
to
the
ordinary
tourist.
that's
what
the
program
is
aimed
at.
that's
the
way
we
set
it
up.
that's
why
we
give
the
ordinary
tourist
something
to
look
at
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
make
the
ordinary
tourist
a
criminal.
thus
the
government
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it
helps
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
its
certainly
is
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
it
is
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
it
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
congress
intended
to
prevent
us
from
doing
that
and
the
government
doesn't
claim
and
has
never
claimed
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
have
every
right
in
the
world
to
operate
the
sweepstakes
program
exactly
the
way
we
operate
it.
every
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no,
the
government
isn't
trying
to
stop
it.
the
government
claims
that
they're
trying
to
stop
somebody
from
latching
onto
it
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
oh,
no
sir,
i'm
sorry
sir.
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
doing
anything
improper.
the
government
never
has
claimed
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
doing
anything
improper.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
government
has
never
said
we
can't
do
this,
this
way.
they
don't
say
it
here
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
not
under
indictment
in
any
way.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no,
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well,
our
position
--
because
we
represent
the
state
is
a
little
bit
different
in
that
we
are
concerned,
it
--
in
essence
it
comes
to
the
same
thing,
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that
quickly.
but
we
are
concerned
that
reading
this
indictment
and
if
this
indictment
were
upheld
under
the
narrow
rules
of
appeals
under
section
3731,
every
tourist
who
come
to
new
hampshire
will
happen
to
put
one
of
our
acknowledgement,
is
in
his
pocket
would
be
in
jeopardy
and
we
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
meant.
we
say
that
the
statute
was
never
intended
for
that.
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
the
government's
point
here
that
this
statute
is
in
some
way
an
extension
or
an
amendment
of
section
1301
which
we
admit
applies
to
the
new
hampshire
program.
section
1301
was
enacted
in
1895
because
the
state
of
louisiana
was
flooding
the
united
states
with
tickets,
sweepstakes
--
not
sweepstakes
ticket,
lottery
tickets
which
could
be
bought
and
sold
and
battered
all
over
the
country
and
it
--
the
statute
admittedly
applies
to
our
operation
and
the
reason,
the
reason
why
we
originally
device
this
particular
piece
of
paper,
as
an
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
black's
question,
the
reason
why
we
devise
this
particular
piece
of
paper
and
put
on
it
this
acknowledgement
is
not
necessary
to
present
for
a
prize
and
so
forth
was
that
we
know
that
section
1301
applied
to
us
and
we
didn't
want
our
tourist
purchasers
to
be
returning
to
their
homes
with
pieces
of
paper
which
plainly
would
violate
section
1301.
that's
the
reason
why
we
made
the
acknowledgement
up
in
the
form
that
we
made
it
up.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
1301
is
a
statute
which
is
designed
particularly
to
prohibit
lotteries.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
i
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
thank
you
your
honor.
just
before
the
noon
recess,
there
was
a
question
concerning
the
relationship
between
section
1301
of
title
18
and
section1953
under
which
indictment
is
brought.
now
the
government
in
its
brief
and
implicitly
in
its
argument
here
seems
to
take
the
position
that
1953
is
just
an
extension
of
1301
and
that
since
the
state
of
new
hampshire
admits
that
section
1301
applies
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes,
therefore
1953
applies.
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
the
legislative
history
of
course
demonstrates
that
1953
was
concerned
with
an
entirely
differently
problem.
this
has
been
briefed
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
we
point
out
that
the
louisiana
lottery
against
which
1301
was
specifically
directed
was
flooding
the
country
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
sweepstakes
--
lottery
tickets.
but
quite
aside
from
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
to
the
court
the
fact
that
as
far
as
1301
is
concern
and
as
far
as
1953
also
is
concern
the
state
of
new
hampshire
could
run
a
lottery
and
give
out
pieces
of
paper
equivalent
to
its
acknowledgements
here
and
the
government
would
not
contend
and
could
not
contend
that
it
was
covered
by
1953.
1953
was
tailor
made
for
the
specific
type
of
organized
gambling
activity
that
the
justice
department
was
aiming
at.
and
it
is
required
as
the
government
admits
in
its
argument
that
one
of
the
elements
which
must
be
shown
is
that
there
is
a
piece
of
paraphernalia
associated
with
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now
an
ordinary
lottery
doesn't
involving
--
doesn't
involve
a
sporting
event
at
all.
so
that
if
we
were
running
an
ordinary
lottery
we
wouldn't
be
here,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
under
the
government's
own
position
and
for
them
to
say
that
1953
is
simply
an
amendment
or
an
extension
of
1301.
its
completely
at
variance
not
only
with
the
legislative
history
but
also
with
any
fair
analysis
of
the
statute.
now
the
other
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
first
time
he
answered
the
question,
he
said
it
would.
and
the
second
time
he
answered
the
question,
i
think
he
said
he
would
have
to
show
something
more.
and
i
think
the
difficulty
is
that
mr.
fabrizio
in
this
record
is
a
tourist
and
that's
why
i
think
the
government
answers
the
question
both
ways.
we
--
of
course
we
say
that
it
doesn't
reach
anybody
in
the
position
of
a
tourist
and
on
this
record
mr.
fabrizio
is
a
tourist.
i
would
like
to
say
also
that
new
hampshire
went
to
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
and
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
structure
its
sweepstakes
program
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
would
we
not
offend
the
federal
law
but
we
would
not
offend
the
state
laws.
we
went
out
of
our
way
to
avoid
the
problem
that
existed
in
the
louisiana
lottery
and
that
exist
today
if
i
may
say
so,
in
the
irish
sweepstakes
which
is
an
abomination
to
the
--
to
this
statute.
the
irish
sweepstakes
violates
this
statute
everyday
of
the
week.
two
weeks
ago
when
this
case
was
scheduled
for
argument
there
were
four
thousand
names
printed
in
the
boston
press
of
persons
who
won
prizes
in
the
irish
sweepstakes
and
everyone
of
those
persons
violated
--
acquired
the
sweepstakes
tickets
illegally
because
an
article
in
fortune
this
month,
the
november
fortune
points
out,
the
irish
sweepstakes
has
a
systematic
way
of
violating
the
statute
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government
this
nation
and
yet
they
don't
get
prosecuted.
now
naturally
the
state
of
new
hampshire
was
offended
at
this
situation.
we
have
gone
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
that
very
problem.
we
do
not
ship
in
interstate
commerce.
we
do
not
release
to
any
one
a
single
blank
ticket
that
can
be
taken
elsewhere
and
sold.
we
do
not
ship
books
of
tickets
in
interstate
commerce,
that's
wagering
paraphernalia
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
if
we
were
to
release
books
of
tickets
in
our
liquor
stores
and
let
people
come
there
and
buy
them
and
return
the
counter
foils
the
way
they
do
with
the
irish
sweepstakes,
we'd
sell
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
of
these
tickets.
the
state
of
new
hampshire
would
run
its
whole
education
program
with
the
proceeds
because
the
irish
sweepstakes
take
30
millions
of
dollars
out
of
the
united
states
every
year
by
doing
just
that,
but
that
is
a
violation
is
section
1953.
that
would
be
shipping
in
interstate
commerce,
carrying
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it's
because
they
permit
their
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
sir
of
paraphernalia
which
is
an
intrical
operative
part
of
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
our
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it's
--
the
actual
ticket
sir
or
any
--
it's
more
than
the
tickets,
it's
the
books
of
tickets,
it's
the
counter
foil,
it's
the
devices
by
which
their
sweepstakes
is
carry
on.
the
devices
by
which
our
sweepstakes
is
carried
on
never
leave
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
that's
why
we
only
sell
$6
million
worth
at
our
best
year.
that's
why
--
because
we
have
to
depend
upon
tourism
to
get
--
to
get
the
customers
and
it's
because
we
have
exercised
this
kind
of
restraint
that
we
feel
that
the
government
is
in
error
in
bringing
this
indictment.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
you
understand
me
correctly
but
i
certainly
support
everything
which
mrs.
friedlander
had
said.
i
think
there
are
dual
grounds
why
this
statute
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
the
new
hampshire
operation
at
all
in
the
abstract
for
the
reasons
mrs.
friedlander
gives.
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
new
hampshire
operation
as
structured
that
is
to
say
as
it
is
described
in
the
record
here
for
the
reason
that
i
give
in
addition
to
the
reasons
that
mrs.
friedlander
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
because
the
statute
merely
proscribes
carriage
of
the
paraphernalia
in
interstate
commerce
in
connection
with
the
wagering
pool
and
the
wagering
pool
so
far
as
the
wagering
pool
is
concern
its
all
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
the
person
--
this
is
why
the
tourist
is
not
covered,
he
is
not
carrying
paraphernalia.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
carrying
a
piece
of
paper,
yes
he
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir,
but
that
is
not
what
the
statute
--
the
--
as
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions,
the
meaning
of
words
is
largely
determined
by
the
purpose
of
congress.
and
it
is
our
position
in
the
brief
and
here
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
reach
the
person
and
the
paraphernalia
which
was
being
circulated
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
sporting
events
as
those
things
are
understood
in
the
manner
mrs.
friedlander
described
them,
illegal
operations,
football
pools,
the
typical
thing
as
a
football
pool.
there's
even
some
doubt
in
my
mind
whether
this
is
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
don't
have
to
come
to
that
because
of
these
other
reasons.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes,
there
would
be
some
doubt
in
my
mind
because
typically
a
wagering
pool
that
they're
talking
about
in
the
history
here
is
the
football
pool
where
you
have
some
elements
of
choice
and
so
on.
whereas
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
ordinary
lotteries
as
i
said
before
plainly
doesn't
apply
to
ordinary
lotteries.
it
apples
to
number,
and
it
applies
to
(inaudible)
but
those
things
as
shown
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
miller
takes
351
of
the
house
hearings
are
specified
things.
they're
terms
of
art,
they're
known
to
the
underworld,
they're
known
to
the
justice
department
and
they're
specific
things.
all
of
the
things
enumerated
in
this
statute
are
specific
things
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
comes
within
by
any
analysis
of
this
statute.
but
as
i
say,
we
don't
feel
we
have
to
come
to
that
because
of
the
two
reasons
that
we
give,
that
it
was
certainly
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
apply
this
particular
statute
to
a
lawful
operation.
and
i'd
like
to
say
in
that
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well,
we
are
also
concern
that
people
who
--
we
--
people
who
purchase
tickets
for
others
should
be
permitted
to
take
them
back.
we
have
a
program
in
new
hampshire
whereby
we
invite
people
to
purchase
sweepstakes
ticket
as
presents
for
their
friends
and
relatives
and
neighbors.
and
we
would
be
greatly
concerned
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
would
have
no
objection
to
their
buying
them
for
their
clients.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no
we
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no
sir,
we
have
never
intended
our
program
to
operate
in
that
manner.
we
do
not
seek
--
we
do
not
have
that
ambition
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
utterly
improper
under
the
laws
of
about
37
to
40
of
the
respective
states
and
that
is
not
what
we
seek
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
simply
seek
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
well
we
don't
think
the
problem
exists.
it
didn't
exist
until
the
government
brought
this
case
and
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor
we
don't
think
that's
a
practical
way
to
run
a
sweepstakes
operation.
we
simply
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
of
course
it
does.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
(inaudible)
of
course
it
does
your
honor.
as
i
said
it's
a
psychological
thing
you
have
meet
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
that
--
well,
there,
the
tax,
we
were
excuse
from
the
wagering
tax
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
--
which
as
you
know
is
also
regulatory.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
was
a
bill
introduced
to
permit
us
to
use
the
mails
which
is
something
else.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
not
--
the
bill
is
not
directed
to
section
1953
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
has
been
a
proposal
of
that
kind.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
in
the
congress
to
permit
--
that
there's
been
a
number
of
proposals
to
have
national
lotteries
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
has
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
there
has
been
a
proposal.
it
was
introduced.
it's
never
been
heard
in
committee.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
it
has
--
it
was
introduced
by
one
of
our
senators
but
it
has
not
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
the
proposal
was
to
exempt
state
operated
--
the
sweepstakes
programs
from
the
limitations
of
section
1302.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir,
it's
as
to
the
mails.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
no,
we
never
thought
it
applied.
we've
taken
this
position
consistently
with
the
justice
department
from
the
day
the
bill
was
signed
that
1953
didn't
apply
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
program.
and
i'd
simply
like
to
close
by
saying
that
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
a
state
operated
program
such
as
ours
where
by
everything
that
has
to
be
done
has
to
be
done
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
any
other
kind
of
lottery
or
sweepstakes
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
we
have
adopted
out
program
to
what
has
happened
to
the
united
states.
we
are
simply
doing
--
we
are
simply
selling
tickets
to
people
who
move
about,
the
mobility
of
our
population.
we're
not
sending
tickets
into
other
states,
we're
just
relying
on
the
fact
that
there
are
2
or
3
million
tourist
who
come
to
the
state
and
its
just
like
for
that
matter
just
like
a
pari-mutuel
program
but
i
might
say
much
less,
much
more
innocuous.
it's
a
simple
thing.
you
buy
a
$3
ticket
you
don't
go
to
the
window
and
from
a
moral
point
of
view
and
bet
and
bet
and
double
your
bet
and
seek
to
get
your
money
back.
it's
a
simple
innocuous
thing
based
on
the
circumstances
of
our
society.
that's
all
it
is
and
we
have
not
in
any
way
flooded
the
county.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
yes
sir.
there's
a
limit,
you
can
--
have
to
go
to
a
special
place
to
buy
more
than
10
and
we
keep
tracks
of
the
names
of
people
who
buy
more
that
10.
we
make
them
fill
out
a
form
so
that
if
any
body
undertakes
the
setup
an
illegal
operation,
we
will
have
the
evidence.
and
we
have
cooperated
with
the
justice
department
in
prosecuting
two
persons
who
sought
to
setup
a
sales
agency
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
the
use
of
the
mail.
we've
done
everything
we
can
in
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
--
we'd
certainly
do.
no
one
can
buy
anything
from
the
state
of
new
hampshire
except
inside
the
state.
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
we
have
no
rule
about
how
many
they
can
buy
but
we
make
them
identify
themselves.
in
other
words
--
mr.
joseph
a.
millimet
--
they
can't
just
put
down
a
100
different
names
not
their
own.
we
make
them
put
down
their
own
name
when
they
buy
tickets
in
bulk
so
we
know
who
they
are.
and
if
they
come
back
time
after
time
doing
this
we
will
know
that
their
violating
or
at
least
we
would
think
that
there
are
violating
are
own
statute
which
prohibits
the
making
of
a
profit
on
the
purchase
and
sale
of
our
tickets
and
we
have
a
system
for
doing
that,
yes
sir.
