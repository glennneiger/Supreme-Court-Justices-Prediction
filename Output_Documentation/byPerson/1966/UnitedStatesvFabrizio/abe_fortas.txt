justice
abe
fortas
suppose
mr.
chapman
that
you
do
have
a
problem
at
this
stage
which
relates
to
the
mechanics
here
because
if
this
question,
one
question
i
suppose
is
whether
this
in
--
the
government's
positions
is
that
this
statute
is
proper
even
if
it
were
construed
to
apply
to
a
trip
of
a
person
from
new
york
to
new
hampshire
with
the
purpose
of
an
intent
of
placing
bets
for
somebody
in
new
york.
and
that
depending
on
the
how
--
on
the
--
how
one
construes
the
acknowledgement
that
may
be
the
way
the
issue
has
to
be
stated
here.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
mr.
fabrizio
has
75
friends
and
they
all
got
together
and
said
that,
"fabrizio,
you
go
to
new
hampshire
and
place
some
bets
for
all
of
us,"
and
fabrizio
did
that
and
he
just
left
the
acknowledgements
in
new
hampshire.
i
suppose
that
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
statute
would
support
an
indictment
there,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
indictment
does
not
fit
within
this
list,
slip,
token
except
for
the
record,
paraphernalia,
if
the
acknowledgement
does
not
fit
within
that
list
then
i
suppose
you
don't
have
a
prosecution.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
before
you
do,
i'll
just
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
more
question.
suppose
i
went
to
new
hampshire
and
i
placed
a
bet,
got
an
acknowledgement
and
then
came
back
to
the
district
of
columbia.
the
way
this
indictment
reads,
you
had
found
an
indictment
exactly
this
same
sort
against
me
even
though
i
just
went
up
there
for
fun.
justice
abe
fortas
this
indictment
would
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
know
about
mine.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
does
the
government
construe
this
statute
as
capable
of
legal
and
constitutional
application
to
the
case
that
i
put
to
mainly
to
a
situation
where
a
person
goes
to
new
hampshire,
buys
a
--
makes
a
bet
for
himself,
comes
back
across
state
lines
with
an
acknowledgement
in
his
pocket.
now,
do
you
construe
the
statute
to
be
applicable
there?
justice
abe
fortas
because
that
--
the
indictment
as
phrased
here
applies
to
that
kind
of
situation
that
you
have
just
stated.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
legal
approach
that
i
don't
understand
frankly.
i
noticed
it
in
your
brief.
by
what
you're
saying
here
is
that
you
can't
--
if
you
agree
that
the
statute
would
not
cover
this
kind
of
a
case
and
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
is
that
you
can
go
to
trial
and
supply
the
deficiency
in
this
indictment.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
indictment
here
as
i
read
it
as
devoid
of
any
reference
to
which
you
now
say
if
i
understand
you
as
an
essential
element.
all
it
says
is
that
he
carried
75
acknowledgements
of
purchase
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
wagering
pool.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
--
but
you've
just
said
that
if
he
carried
the
acknowledgements
across
state
line
to
be
--
to
burn
them
up
when
he
got
to
new
york,
if
that
would
not
be
an
offense
under
the
statute
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
said,
still
be
--
you're
still
talking
about
acknowledgements
that
he
had
made
a
--
placed
a
bet
in
new
hampshire,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
is
it
your
position
that
merely
because
they
were
acknowledgements
of
a
bet
that
it
had
been
made
in
new
hampshire,
transportation
across
the
state
line
is
a
violation
of
this
statute?
and
if
that
is
so,
then
you're
contradicting
what
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
earlier
statement
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
no,
they
had
been
used,
sir.
the
acknowledgment
had
already
been
used.
there
was
an
acknowledgement
of
a
bet
that
had
been
placed.
now
do
you
also
have
to
allege?
is
it
your
construction
of
this
statute
that
you
have
to
allege
some
thing
beyond
that
that
is
to
say
that
fabrizio
is
going
to
do
something
with
the
acknowledgement
in
the
nature
of
gambling
or
participation
in
a
pool
after
he
gets
back
to
new
york?
if
you
don't
include
that
element,
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
you'll
have
to
reconsider
your
answer
to
my
previous
question,
which
is
whether
if
i
go
to
new
hampshire,
make
a
bet,
carry
the
acknowledgement
back
with
me
to
the
district
of
columbia,
am
i
violating
this
statute
as
the
government
construes
it?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
before
you
do
that,
you
get
--
i'm
having
a
lot
of
difficulty.
is
it
your
statement
to
us
or
is
it
not
that
as
the
government
construes
this
statute,
the
acknowledgement
brought
across
state
line
has
to
have
a
subsequent
and
additional
wagering
function?
that's
about
as
plainly
as
i
can
say
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
already
had
a
wagering
function.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
you
see
if
that
is
so,
yes
mr.
chapman,
if
that
is
so,
if
what
you
have
just
said
is
so
then
when
i
bring
my
acknowledgement
back
from
new
hampshire,
i
can
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute.
there's
a
subsequent
wagering
function
in
the
sense
that
if
i
win
i'm
certainly
going
to
collect.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
bothers
me
in
this
case
stated
very
--
as
plainly
as
i
can
is
that
--
as
the
government
construes
--
i
am
afraid
that
as
the
government
construes
this
statute
as
reflected
by
the
way
this
indictment
is
framed
the
government
can
indict
and
successfully
prosecute
somebody
who
goes
up
to
new
hampshire
buys
75
tickets
and
comes
back
across
state
lines
with
75
acknowledgements
in
his
pocket
regardless
of
anything
else
in
his
subsequent
act
thereafter,
that's
what
bothers
me.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
you
people
brought
this
case
up
to
us.
justice
abe
fortas
and
under
this
particular
indictment
and
i've
got
to
assume
that
you
believe
that
to
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
authorize
the
fact
--
the
grafting
and
filing
of
this
kind
of
an
indictment
which
doesn't
say
anything
more
to
me
than
that
fabrizio
bought
75
--
placed
75
bets,
got
75
acknowledgements
and
went
across
state
lines
with
the
75
acknowledgements
in
his
hot
hand
so
as
you
say.
i
would
contend
that
it
says
one
thing
which
in
our
view
of
the
statute
is
--
one
thing
very
significant
more
than
what
you've
described
and
that
is
it
alleges
that
these
acknowledgements
had
a
wagering
use.
this
is
the
crucial
element
in
the
statute.
the
same
thing
again
with
the
--
if
we
only
allege
that
we
were
taking
these
acknowledgements
--
that
he
was
taking
the
acknowledgements
across
the
state
line
for
use
in
a
paper
drive
we
wouldn't
alleged
a
sufficient
to
element
for
the
offense
under
1953.
but
we
did
allege
that
he
brought
this
across
to
be
used
and
that
they
were
adapted
and
devised
and
designed
for
use
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you've
got
to
the,
to
wit,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
this
legislative
history,
senator
kefauver's
statement
or
solicitor
--
or
the
assistant
attorney
general's
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chapman,
do
i
correctly
read
subsection
b
of
1953,
i
could
go
to
new
york
or
to
some
state
where
there
are
pari-mutuel
betting,
i
could
buy
a
pari-mutuel
ticket
at
the
race
track.
i
could
then
carry
that
across
state
lines
and
that
would
be
an
exempt
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
can
go
and
buy
75
of
them
and
still
exempt,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
suppose
if
the
--
i
don't
know
enough
about
this
so
but
i
--
to
know,
but
i
suppose
if
this
cannot
stretch
in
the
imagination
be
called
pari-mutuel(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
at
new
york
went
ahead
with
(inaudible),
and
he
went
up
there
and
bought
a
ticket
off
track
that
might
--
that
would
not
be
a
pari-mutuel
ticket
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
that
across
state
lines
or
this
statute
had
to
be
amended
but
that's
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
who
was
--
i'm
sorry
to
take
some
of
your
time.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
exemption
for
pari-mutuel
tickets
legally
acquired?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
an
indication,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
acknowledgement
in
this
case
says
non-saleable
and
non-transferable.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
construes
this
statute
would
that
be
crime?
let's
suppose
that
i
asked
a
friend
who
is
going
to
new
hampshire
to
place
a
bet
to
me
and
this
friend
did
it
and
brought
back
the
acknowledgement.
would
both
of
us
be
guilty
of
a
crime
under
this
statute
as
the
government
construes
the
statute?
it
separate
it
from
any
course
of
business
or
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
large
scale
gambling
enterprise
but
i
just
have
said
that
to
a
friend.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
how
can
--
because
you've
obviously
an
acknowledgement
has
a
wagering
function.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
has
a
wagering
function
separate
and
apart
from
the
new
hampshire's
scheme
itself?
justice
abe
fortas
--no
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
question
is
whether
there
has
to
be
an
additional
wagering
function
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
transaction
that
is
to
say
whether
as
applied
here
whether
it
would
be
essential
that
mr.
fabrizio
is
in
effect
sort
of
engaged
in
the
business
of
acting
as
broker
or
agent
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
reselling
these
new
hampshire
participations.
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
friedlander
the
printed
record
does
not
include
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulars.
the
bill
of
particulars
itself
appears
on
page
five
of
the
printed
record.
what
was
the
substance
of
the
bill
of
particulars?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
only
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
all
unless
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
take
it
that
the
point
that
you
and
mrs.
friedlander
is
making
is
that
that
is
not
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
government
is
serving
up
to
this
court
for
decision
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
acknowledgements
would
be
paraphernalia
to
that
pool.
justice
abe
fortas
when
was
that
proposal?
what
was
that
proposal?
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
the
mails
used
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
only,
not
as
to
this?
not
to
exempt
new
hampshire
from
the
stroke
of
this
section?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
its
quite
it.
question
is,
does
it
have
to
--
let
me
kind
of
put
it
this
way.
does
the
indictment
have
to
charge,
that's
number
one
or
number
two
on
your
favor,
does
the
evidence
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
wagering
use
or
purpose
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
paper
serves
a
(inaudible)
however
slight
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
--
no,
okay.
so
that
that
means
that
a
tourist
who
goes
to
new
hampshire
and
buys
and
puts
down
his
$3
or
whatever
it
is
gets
an
acknowledgement,
puts
it
in
his
pocket,
goes
back
to
new
york
can
be
indicted
and
prosecuted
under
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no.
you
just
take
the
acknowledgement
as
it
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
what
it
is
in
new
hampshire.
justice
abe
fortas
and
my
questions
stands
in
your
--
in
another
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
totally
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
but
i
guess
that's
irrelevant
too.
justice
abe
fortas
why
then
--
why
didn't
--
why
does
this
indictment
say
something
more
when
mr.
fabrizio
is
not
a
tourist
and
if
he
is
engaged
in
running
a
pool
inside
of
new
york
state
or
buying
this
for
somebody
else.
the
only
reason
that
it
wasn't
cited
in
the
indictment
that
i
can
say
is
to
order
to
make
the
case
easier
to
prove.
is
there
any
other
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
not
stating
the
more
conservative
view
of
the
statute,
more
conservative
theory
of
the
statute
in
an
indictment
if
the
facts
spit
the
more
conservative
view
except
to
facilitate
proof?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
mr.
chapman
that
you
do
have
a
problem
at
this
stage
which
relates
to
the
mechanics
here
because
if
this
question,
one
question
i
suppose
is
whether
this
in
--
the
government's
positions
is
that
this
statute
is
proper
even
if
it
were
construed
to
apply
to
a
trip
of
a
person
from
new
york
to
new
hampshire
with
the
purpose
of
an
intent
of
placing
bets
for
somebody
in
new
york.
and
that
depending
on
the
how
--
on
the
--
how
one
construes
the
acknowledgement
that
may
be
the
way
the
issue
has
to
be
stated
here.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
mr.
fabrizio
has
75
friends
and
they
all
got
together
and
said
that,
"fabrizio,
you
go
to
new
hampshire
and
place
some
bets
for
all
of
us,"
and
fabrizio
did
that
and
he
just
left
the
acknowledgements
in
new
hampshire.
i
suppose
that
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
statute
would
support
an
indictment
there,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
indictment
does
not
fit
within
this
list,
slip,
token
except
for
the
record,
paraphernalia,
if
the
acknowledgement
does
not
fit
within
that
list
then
i
suppose
you
don't
have
a
prosecution.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
before
you
do,
i'll
just
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
more
question.
suppose
i
went
to
new
hampshire
and
i
placed
a
bet,
got
an
acknowledgement
and
then
came
back
to
the
district
of
columbia.
the
way
this
indictment
reads,
you
had
found
an
indictment
exactly
this
same
sort
against
me
even
though
i
just
went
up
there
for
fun.
justice
abe
fortas
this
indictment
would
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
know
about
mine.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
does
the
government
construe
this
statute
as
capable
of
legal
and
constitutional
application
to
the
case
that
i
put
to
mainly
to
a
situation
where
a
person
goes
to
new
hampshire,
buys
a
--
makes
a
bet
for
himself,
comes
back
across
state
lines
with
an
acknowledgement
in
his
pocket.
now,
do
you
construe
the
statute
to
be
applicable
there?
justice
abe
fortas
because
that
--
the
indictment
as
phrased
here
applies
to
that
kind
of
situation
that
you
have
just
stated.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
legal
approach
that
i
don't
understand
frankly.
i
noticed
it
in
your
brief.
by
what
you're
saying
here
is
that
you
can't
--
if
you
agree
that
the
statute
would
not
cover
this
kind
of
a
case
and
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
is
that
you
can
go
to
trial
and
supply
the
deficiency
in
this
indictment.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
indictment
here
as
i
read
it
as
devoid
of
any
reference
to
which
you
now
say
if
i
understand
you
as
an
essential
element.
all
it
says
is
that
he
carried
75
acknowledgements
of
purchase
to
be
used
in
the
new
hampshire
wagering
pool.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
--
but
you've
just
said
that
if
he
carried
the
acknowledgements
across
state
line
to
be
--
to
burn
them
up
when
he
got
to
new
york,
if
that
would
not
be
an
offense
under
the
statute
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
said,
still
be
--
you're
still
talking
about
acknowledgements
that
he
had
made
a
--
placed
a
bet
in
new
hampshire,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
is
it
your
position
that
merely
because
they
were
acknowledgements
of
a
bet
that
it
had
been
made
in
new
hampshire,
transportation
across
the
state
line
is
a
violation
of
this
statute?
and
if
that
is
so,
then
you're
contradicting
what
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
earlier
statement
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
no,
they
had
been
used,
sir.
the
acknowledgment
had
already
been
used.
there
was
an
acknowledgement
of
a
bet
that
had
been
placed.
now
do
you
also
have
to
allege?
is
it
your
construction
of
this
statute
that
you
have
to
allege
some
thing
beyond
that
that
is
to
say
that
fabrizio
is
going
to
do
something
with
the
acknowledgement
in
the
nature
of
gambling
or
participation
in
a
pool
after
he
gets
back
to
new
york?
if
you
don't
include
that
element,
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
you'll
have
to
reconsider
your
answer
to
my
previous
question,
which
is
whether
if
i
go
to
new
hampshire,
make
a
bet,
carry
the
acknowledgement
back
with
me
to
the
district
of
columbia,
am
i
violating
this
statute
as
the
government
construes
it?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
before
you
do
that,
you
get
--
i'm
having
a
lot
of
difficulty.
is
it
your
statement
to
us
or
is
it
not
that
as
the
government
construes
this
statute,
the
acknowledgement
brought
across
state
line
has
to
have
a
subsequent
and
additional
wagering
function?
that's
about
as
plainly
as
i
can
say
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
already
had
a
wagering
function.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
you
see
if
that
is
so,
yes
mr.
chapman,
if
that
is
so,
if
what
you
have
just
said
is
so
then
when
i
bring
my
acknowledgement
back
from
new
hampshire,
i
can
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute.
there's
a
subsequent
wagering
function
in
the
sense
that
if
i
win
i'm
certainly
going
to
collect.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
bothers
me
in
this
case
stated
very
--
as
plainly
as
i
can
is
that
--
as
the
government
construes
--
i
am
afraid
that
as
the
government
construes
this
statute
as
reflected
by
the
way
this
indictment
is
framed
the
government
can
indict
and
successfully
prosecute
somebody
who
goes
up
to
new
hampshire
buys
75
tickets
and
comes
back
across
state
lines
with
75
acknowledgements
in
his
pocket
regardless
of
anything
else
in
his
subsequent
act
thereafter,
that's
what
bothers
me.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
you
people
brought
this
case
up
to
us.
justice
abe
fortas
and
under
this
particular
indictment
and
i've
got
to
assume
that
you
believe
that
to
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
authorize
the
fact
--
the
grafting
and
filing
of
this
kind
of
an
indictment
which
doesn't
say
anything
more
to
me
than
that
fabrizio
bought
75
--
placed
75
bets,
got
75
acknowledgements
and
went
across
state
lines
with
the
75
acknowledgements
in
his
hot
hand
so
as
you
say.
i
would
contend
that
it
says
one
thing
which
in
our
view
of
the
statute
is
--
one
thing
very
significant
more
than
what
you've
described
and
that
is
it
alleges
that
these
acknowledgements
had
a
wagering
use.
this
is
the
crucial
element
in
the
statute.
the
same
thing
again
with
the
--
if
we
only
allege
that
we
were
taking
these
acknowledgements
--
that
he
was
taking
the
acknowledgements
across
the
state
line
for
use
in
a
paper
drive
we
wouldn't
alleged
a
sufficient
to
element
for
the
offense
under
1953.
but
we
did
allege
that
he
brought
this
across
to
be
used
and
that
they
were
adapted
and
devised
and
designed
for
use
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you've
got
to
the,
to
wit,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
this
legislative
history,
senator
kefauver's
statement
or
solicitor
--
or
the
assistant
attorney
general's
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chapman,
do
i
correctly
read
subsection
b
of
1953,
i
could
go
to
new
york
or
to
some
state
where
there
are
pari-mutuel
betting,
i
could
buy
a
pari-mutuel
ticket
at
the
race
track.
i
could
then
carry
that
across
state
lines
and
that
would
be
an
exempt
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
can
go
and
buy
75
of
them
and
still
exempt,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
suppose
if
the
--
i
don't
know
enough
about
this
so
but
i
--
to
know,
but
i
suppose
if
this
cannot
stretch
in
the
imagination
be
called
pari-mutuel(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
at
new
york
went
ahead
with
(inaudible),
and
he
went
up
there
and
bought
a
ticket
off
track
that
might
--
that
would
not
be
a
pari-mutuel
ticket
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
that
across
state
lines
or
this
statute
had
to
be
amended
but
that's
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
who
was
--
i'm
sorry
to
take
some
of
your
time.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
exemption
for
pari-mutuel
tickets
legally
acquired?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
an
indication,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
acknowledgement
in
this
case
says
non-saleable
and
non-transferable.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
government
construes
this
statute
would
that
be
crime?
let's
suppose
that
i
asked
a
friend
who
is
going
to
new
hampshire
to
place
a
bet
to
me
and
this
friend
did
it
and
brought
back
the
acknowledgement.
would
both
of
us
be
guilty
of
a
crime
under
this
statute
as
the
government
construes
the
statute?
it
separate
it
from
any
course
of
business
or
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
large
scale
gambling
enterprise
but
i
just
have
said
that
to
a
friend.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
how
can
--
because
you've
obviously
an
acknowledgement
has
a
wagering
function.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
has
a
wagering
function
separate
and
apart
from
the
new
hampshire's
scheme
itself?
justice
abe
fortas
--no
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
question
is
whether
there
has
to
be
an
additional
wagering
function
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
transaction
that
is
to
say
whether
as
applied
here
whether
it
would
be
essential
that
mr.
fabrizio
is
in
effect
sort
of
engaged
in
the
business
of
acting
as
broker
or
agent
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
reselling
these
new
hampshire
participations.
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
friedlander
the
printed
record
does
not
include
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulars.
the
bill
of
particulars
itself
appears
on
page
five
of
the
printed
record.
what
was
the
substance
of
the
bill
of
particulars?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
only
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
all
unless
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
take
it
that
the
point
that
you
and
mrs.
friedlander
is
making
is
that
that
is
not
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
government
is
serving
up
to
this
court
for
decision
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
acknowledgements
would
be
paraphernalia
to
that
pool.
justice
abe
fortas
when
was
that
proposal?
what
was
that
proposal?
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
the
mails
used
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
only,
not
as
to
this?
not
to
exempt
new
hampshire
from
the
stroke
of
this
section?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
its
quite
it.
question
is,
does
it
have
to
--
let
me
kind
of
put
it
this
way.
does
the
indictment
have
to
charge,
that's
number
one
or
number
two
on
your
favor,
does
the
evidence
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
wagering
use
or
purpose
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
paper
serves
a
(inaudible)
however
slight
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
--
no,
okay.
so
that
that
means
that
a
tourist
who
goes
to
new
hampshire
and
buys
and
puts
down
his
$3
or
whatever
it
is
gets
an
acknowledgement,
puts
it
in
his
pocket,
goes
back
to
new
york
can
be
indicted
and
prosecuted
under
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no.
you
just
take
the
acknowledgement
as
it
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
what
it
is
in
new
hampshire.
justice
abe
fortas
and
my
questions
stands
in
your
--
in
another
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
totally
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
but
i
guess
that's
irrelevant
too.
justice
abe
fortas
why
then
--
why
didn't
--
why
does
this
indictment
say
something
more
when
mr.
fabrizio
is
not
a
tourist
and
if
he
is
engaged
in
running
a
pool
inside
of
new
york
state
or
buying
this
for
somebody
else.
the
only
reason
that
it
wasn't
cited
in
the
indictment
that
i
can
say
is
to
order
to
make
the
case
easier
to
prove.
is
there
any
other
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
not
stating
the
more
conservative
view
of
the
statute,
more
conservative
theory
of
the
statute
in
an
indictment
if
the
facts
spit
the
more
conservative
view
except
to
facilitate
proof?
