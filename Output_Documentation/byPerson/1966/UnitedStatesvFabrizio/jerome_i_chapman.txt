mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
by
the
district
court.
that
court
decision
was
bases
upon
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
was
founded
that
is
18
u.s.
code
section
1953
and
the
only
question
before
this
court
on
direct
appeal
is
the
interpretation
of
that
statute.
so
far
as
it
is
relevant
here,
section
1953
prohibits
anyone
except
the
common
carrier
in
the
usual
course
of
this
business
form
knowingly
transporting
in
interstate
commerce
"any
record,
paraphernalia,
ticket,
certificate,
bills,
slip,
token,
paper,
writing
or
other
device
used
or
to
be
used
or
adapted
device
or
design
for
used
in
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event."
the
indictment
which
the
lower
court
dismissed
closely
parallel
to
statutory
language,
it
alleges
that
on
or
about
august
24
1964,
anthony
l.
fabrizio,
the
appellee,
knowingly
carried
in
interstate
commerce
from
keene,
new
hampshire
to
elmira,
new
york
"records,
papers
writings,
to
wit:
75
acknowledgments
of
purchase
for
a
sweepstakes
race
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
to
be
used,
and
adapted,
devised
and
designed
for
use,
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event,"
that
is:
a
sweepstakes
race
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
indictment
was
filed
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
september
1964.
in
october
1964,
appellee
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
of
his
former
counsel
setting
forth
appellee's
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
section
1953.
the
government
filed
a
memorandum
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
motion
was
submitted
on
the
papers
without
oral
argument.
on
october
5,
1965
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
stating
only
the
following
reason
"the
charge
in
the
indictment
does
not
come
within
the
purpose
of
section
1953
as
disclosed
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
court
did
not
further
elaborate
the
position."
under
the
limiting
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
under
which
this
direct
appeal
is
brought
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
a
pleading
is
not
before
this
court
and
neither
is
the
question
whether
the
government
can
adduce
sufficient
proof
to
establish
its
factual
allegations.
stated
concretely
the
only
question
involved
here
is
the
following,
does
an
indictment
alleging
the
knowing
interstate
carriage
of
acknowledgements
of
purchase
to
be
used
an
adapted
device
and
designed
for
use
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
state
a
crime
under
section
1953?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
it
is.
i'm
printing
that
now
mr.
justice.
so
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
briefly
sketch
the
mechanics
of
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
operation
and
to
touch
upon
the
function
therein
of
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
which
is
the
paper
that
appellee
carried
in
interstate
commerce.
after
doing
this
i'll
turn
to
the
legal
questions
involved
in
the
case.
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
is
operated
by
the
new
hampshire
commission
established
by
law.
it
is
by
undoubted
--
undeniably
a
legal
operation
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
maybe
purchased
at
the
sweepstakes
commission
headquarters
at
51
state
liquor
stores,
two
race
tracks
and
two
highway
toll
plazas
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
tickets
are
in
the
first
instance
contained
in
a
specially
designed
ticket
dispensing
machine
which
is
very
much
like
the
airline
insurance
policy
dispensing
machine
that
is
quite
common.
the
sweepstakes
ticket
itself,
now
i
have
a
copy
of
the
ticket
here
which
you
may
not
all
be
able
to
see
but
the
facsimile
of
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
appears
on
the
page
nine
in
the
record
in
it's
a
--
as
i
will
point
out
the
differences
and
similarities
it
may
be
easier
to
refer
to
that
rather
than
to
--
what
i
have
in
my
hand.
in
the
machine
when
one
first
approaches
the
machine
through
an
opening
at
the
top
the
sweepstakes
ticket
appears
in
such
a
manner
that
one
can
write
the
required
information
on
the
face
of
the
ticket.
now
immediately
beneath
that
ticket
in
the
machine
is
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
which
is
essentially
identical,
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment
the
differences.
this
is
not
visible
to
the
purchaser,
it's
inside
the
machine
underneath
the
ticket
and
it's
put
there
so
that
one
writing
on
the
ticket
will
make
a
carbon
copy
and
pressure
it
on
the
same
lines
on
the
acknowledgement.
the
information
asked
on
the
ticket
as
the
copy
on
page
nine
shows
is
the
name,
address,
city
and
state.
when
a
person
wants
to
buy
a
sweepstakes
ticket
at
one
of
the
various
locations
where
the
tickets
are
sold,
he
first
goes
to
a
clerk
in
the
store
or
at
the
office
or
at
the
race
track
and
pays
three
dollars
per
ticket.
upon
receiving
the
money
the
clerk
activates
this
ticket
dispensing
machine
for
the
sale
of
--
as
many
tickets
as
the
person
has
paid
for
up
to
10.
the
most
you
can
get
one
stretch
is
10
tickets.
the
purchaser
then
proceeds
to
the
machine
and
writes
on
the
face
of
the
ticket
itself
a
name,
address,
and
a
city
and
a
state.
doesn't
have
to
be
that
persons
own
name
and
address
in
fact
it
doesn't
have
to
be
any
persons'
name
and
address.
it
can
be
a
club
or
a
corporation
or
a
school
or
an
association
or
it
can
be
more
than
one
person,
mister
and
misses
so
and
so.
but
the
name
and
address
that
appears
on
the
ticket
and
simultaneously
is
recorded
on
the
carbon
copy
on
the
acknowledgement
is
crucial
because
the
prizes
on
the
sweepstakes
are
awarded
on
the
basis
of
that
name
and
that
address.
the
--
after
the
person
has
written
the
name
and
address
on
the
ticket
he
pulls
a
lever.
at
that
point
the
ticket
and
the
acknowledgement
part
company,
the
ticket
is
deposited
inside
the
machine,
the
acknowledgment
is
ejected
and
for
the
--
for
whatever
purposes
the
purchaser
wants
to
make
of
it.
at
this
point
let
me
point
out
exactly
where
the
acknowledgement
and
the
sweepstakes
ticket
itself
differ.
they
are
in
fact
identical
with
one
exception
where
the
tickets
has
printed
somewhat
slightly
above
the
top
of
the
top
half
of
the
page
in
large
print
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
ticket.
the
acknowledgement
and
this
is
shown
better
in
the
record
on
page
9
contains
a
legend
which
says
that
this
is
not
a
ticket,
this
is
an
acknowledgement,
you
don't
have
to
present
this
to
win
a
prize,
it
says
as
an
essence.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i'm
about
to
describe
that
actually
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
they
have
--
they
don't
have
to
present
anything.
let
me
make
one
further
point
about
this
acknowledgement
with
reference
to
the
facsimile
in
the
record
just
to
make
it
perfectly
clear.
this
facsimile
in
the
record
is
approximately
the
--
is
almost
exactly
the
actual
size,
there's
a
slight
variation.
in
the
record
there
are
some
parts
of
the
printing
comes
--
come
out
very
prominently,
very
heavy.
other
parts
come
out
very
light.
well,
actually
what
that
represent
is
different
colors.
the
part
that
comes
out
very
heavy
here
is
really
just
red
typed,
the
part
that
comes
out
light
is
blue
typed
so
that
in
the
actual
acknowledgement
this
phrase
that
this
is
only
an
acknowledgement,
it
need
not
be
presented
while
its
quite
clear
does
not
come
out,
thus
not
stand
out
as
prominently
as
it
--
as
one
would
expect
looking
only
at
the
way
the
facsimile
is
recorded
in
the
record.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
this
was
crossed
out
--
blank
out
for
purposes
of
printing
the
record.
there
is
no
reason
to
place
in
the
record
the
name
of
the
person
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
this
was
attached
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
by
appellee
and
i
assume
although
i'm
not
certain
in
it,
appellee's
counsel
may
clear
this
up
and
i
assumed
that
this
was
one
of
the
acknowledgments
that
he
--
one
of
the
75
acknowledgement
he
actually
carried.
so
just
to
preserve
the
identity
of
the
individual
involved
and
since
he
was
not
relevant
they
blanked
that
out.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
blanked
that
out.
but
on
all
acknowledgements
of
course
there
would
be
a
name
and
address
and
then
the
city
and
the
state.
now
this
is
what
happens
and
this
is
directed
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
after
the
lever
is
pulled
the
ticket
is
deposited
within
the
machine
and
the
acknowledgement
is
ejected
outside
the
machine.
let
me
direct
myself
now
only
to
the
ticket,
we'll
leave
acknowledgement
to
one
side
but
the
ticket
is
the
thing
that
counts
as
far
as
winning
the
price
is
concern.
the
tickets
are
deposited
in
the
machine
and
are
collected
by
sweepstakes
commission
agents
periodically.
when
they
are
collected
from
the
machines
they
are
taken
directly
to
bank
deposit
vaults
in
various
parts
of
the
state
and
ultimately
are
gathered
together
in
one
bank
vault
in
manchester,
new
hampshire.
process
of
selling
tickets
in
the
sweepstakes
goes
over
a
relatively
long
period
of
time.
there
where
two
sweepstakes
races
run
this
year.
for
the
first
one,
the
ticket
selling
period
covered
about
an
11
month
period.
but
for
the
second
one,
it
was
about
a
six
month
period.
so
all
this
tickets
over
time
are
collected
and
put
into
the
bank
vault.
finally,
very
shortly
before
the
sweepstake
race
is
run,
the
sweepstakes
race
is
one
of
the
factors
in
determining
who
wins
what
prizes.
very
shortly
before
this
time
the
tickets
are
placed
in
drums
or
barrels
from
which
they
are
to
be
drawn.
shortly
before
the
race,
a
certain
number
of
tickets
are
drawn.
now
the
number
varies
somewhat
depending
on
how
much
money
has
been
put
into
the
pool,
how
much
money
has
been
bet
by
the
various
purchasers.
but
for
simplicities
sake
and
i
think
this
will
serve
our
purposes,
its
fair
to
say
that
there
is
one
ticket
drawn
for
each
horse
nominated
in
the
sweepstake
race.
in
other
words
there
may
be
300
horses
nominated
or
eligible
for
a
running
in
the
particular
race
that's
involved.
if
that's
so,
300
tickets
will
be
drawn
and
each
ticket
will
be
matched
with
one
of
the
eligible
horses.
everyone
whose
ticket
is
thus
drawn
is
entitled
to
some
price
simply
because
his
ticket
is
drawn.
this
year,
in
the
1966
sweepstakes
those
people
whose
tickets
were
drawn
in
the
first
instance
and
didn't
get
any
further
prices
shared
in
a
pool
of
$60,000.
now
after
the
300
tickets
are
drawn,
the
day
of
the
race
comes
and
of
course
300
tickets
--
300
horses
don't
run
on
the
race
only
a
certain
number
of
them,
lets
say
for
example
20,
actually
finally
do
get
entered
into
the
race
and
are
off
when
the
race
is
called.
well,
the
persons
whose
tickets
are
matched
with
these
20
horses
qualify
for
a
higher
price.
this
year
those
persons
shared
in
a
pool
of
$20,000
there.
roughly
their
price
was
something
like
five
or
six
times
more
than
the
people
who
were
matched
with
horses
that
never
ran.
finally
of
course,
there
are
the
top
three
prizes
which
are
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
horses
that
run
first,
second
and
third
in
the
race.
if
my
ticket
was
matched
with
the
horse
that
ran
first,
this
year
i
would've
won
$50,000.
if
i
had
a
ticket
matched
with
the
second
horse,
i
would've
won
$25,000.
if
i
had
a
ticket
matched
with
the
third
horse,
i
would've
won
$12,500.
this
is
the
way
the
winners
are
picked.
now
the
winner
is
determined
by
the
name
and
address
that
appears
on
the
actual
ticket
that
has
been
deposited
in
the
machine,
later
transfer
to
the
safety
deposit
vaults,
later
transferred
to
the
drums
all
within
the
custody
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
all
within
the
custody
of
the
sweepstakes
commission.
the
winners
are
notified
in
the
first
instance
by
telegram
whatever
name
and
address
the
telegram
is
sent
to.
after
it
is
determined
how
much
each
of
these
people
win
depending
on
whether
the
horse
run
at
all
and
if
so
how
it
ran.
whatever
the
price
money
is,
it's
deposited
in
a
new
hampshire
bank,
in
manchester
i
believe
to
the
credit
of
whoever's
name
and
address
or
whatever
group's
name
and
address
appears
on
the
ticket
itself.
then
payment
is
made
through
normal
banking
channels.
now
if
i
live
in
new
hampshire
or
if
i
want
to
travel
up
to
new
hampshire,
if
i
live
in
some
other
state
but
i
wanted
to
go
up
to
new
hampshire
to
collect
my
prize
they
would
write
at
the
bank,
it
would
issue
a
check
and
i
could
just
take
that
from
there.
but
if
i
leave
in
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
same
thing
you
have
to
show
in
any
bank
to
get
any
deposit
out
of
it.
you
simply
identify
yourself
as
the
person
whose
name
and
address
appears
on
this
ticket.
you
do
not
have
to
show
them
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase.
i
think
that
if
--
if
there
was
any
doubt
and
you
did
show
them
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
that
would
clear
out
any
doubt.
but
as
a
sweepstakes
is
operated
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
do
anything
with
the
manchester
bank
different
from
what
you
would
do
to
get
your
money
out
any
bank
where
its
been
deposited.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
the
--
that's
one
of
the
big
questions
in
this
case.
i
can
turn
to
that
briefly
now
and
then
in
more
detail
after
i
--
i
would
like
to
go
into
more
detail
after
having
sketched
out
the
legal
issue.
one
thing
can
be
said
clearly
about
the
acknowledgment
as
a
carbon
copy
of
the
sweepstakes
ticket.
it
serves
to
show
that
a
ticket
had
actually
been
purchased
in
the
name
and
address
of
the
person
whose
name
and
address
appears
on
this,
to
the
carbon
copy.
now
there
might
be
various
uses
that
can
be
made
of
such
a
document
that
serves
such
a
purpose.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
only
point
out
only
one
primarily
because
this
is
the
function
that
we
alleged
that
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief,
we
expect
to
prove
was
the
actual
function
of
it,
of
the
75
acknowledgements
used
in
this
case.
namely
to
facilitate
the
purchase
of
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
by
persons
who
did
not
actually
travel
to
new
hampshire,
did
not
actually
come
into
the
state
and
bought
their
tickets
there.
in
other
words
it
would
operate
and
we
expect
to
prove
that
it
did
operate
in
this
fashion.
someone
acting
as
a
broker,
in
this
case
the
defendant,
the
appellee
mr.
fabrizio
would
solicit
sales
of
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
in
other
states.
here,
it
was
in
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
would
take
orders
from
his
customers,
get
their
names
and
their
addresses.
then
after
having
compiled
a
sufficient
number
of
orders
travel
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
buy
tickets
in
their
names
and
addresses
by
writing
the
customers
name,
the
customers
address
on
each
of
these
tickets,
get
and
acknowledge
therefore.
now,
as
i've
said,
the
acknowledgement
verifies
officially
that
a
ticket
has
been
purchased
for
joe
jones,
401
5th
street
for
example.
with
this
acknowledgement,
the
broker
can
travel
back
to
new
york
or
whatever
state
it
is
and
verify
to
his
customers
that
he
has
in
fact
carried
out
the
--
their
orders.
has
in
fact
order
a
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
ticket
for
them.
this
is
one
function
and
this
is
the
only
function
i
think
relevant
here
because
this
is
what
we
--
if
we're
allowed
to
go
to
trial,
we
expect
to
prove
it
happened
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
don't
think
we
have
to
be,
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
exactly
our
contention
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice.
i'm
--
i
make
something
of
it
now
because
--
and
i
shall
at
the
close
of
my
argument
because
the
appellee
and
--
in
the
amicus
suggest
that
on
the
basis
of
this
indictment,
they
suggest
on
their
briefs
that
on
the
basis
of
this
indictment
we
could
not
prove
the
state
of
facts
that
i
described
for
you
that
we
expect
to
prove
at
the
trial.
(voice
overlap)
well
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
what?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
would
say
that
the
construction
of
the
acknowledgment
and
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
susceptible
of
being
used
or
which
in
any
particular
situation
it
has
been
used
is
essentially
a
question
of
fact
which
must
be
fit
within
the
framework
of
this
statute.
now,
i
think
that
that
--
i
don't
mean
to
propose
that
this
is
--
to
suggest
that
you
must
completely
throw
the
acknowledgement
to
one
side
when
you're
trying
to
determine
the
issue
here,
mainly
what
framework
must
this
be
read
again.
but
i
think
that
it
is
more
crucial
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
to
establish
the
statutory
framework
against
which
we
must
test
this
acknowledgement
and
its
function
rather
than
to
hypothecate
any
particular
state
of
facts
which
may
or
may
not
fit
within
that
stick
of
a
framework.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
because
there
are
five
elements
of
the
offense.
one
of
which
and
this
is
not
a
matter
of
any
dispute
at
all,
its
interstate
transportation
of
certain
objects.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
if
nothing
is
transported.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
right
mr.
justice
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
no
longer
is
contend
--
that
no
longer
is
questioned
here
either.
the
acknowledgement
at
--
this
was
put
an
issue
in
the
affidavit
filed
by
appellee's
former
counsel
in
the
lower
court
suggesting
that
the
acknowledgement
has
no
function
whatsoever
so
far
as
the
sweepstakes
is
concern
so
therefore
it's
not
wagering
paraphernalia.
but
that
--
that's
not
contended
here
anymore,
the
statute
covers
among
other
things,
records,
papers
and
writings.
and
i
think
its
common
ground
that
if
the
acknowledgement
is
nothing
else
it's
a
record,
paper
in
writing.
it's
the
other
--
it's
the
fifth
element
and
this
is
the
one
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
certainly.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
think
we
--
let
me
--
i
think
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
think
this
similar
example
would
also
illustrate
it
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
anybody
can
phrase
an
indictment
regardless
of
what's
fact
you
can
actually
prove
to
substantiate
the
indictment
that
can
pass
a
muster
under
any
statute.
if
i
--
if
there
was
an
indictment
alleging
that
i
with
evil
intent
assaulted
mr.
glazer,
i
suppose
that
indictment
would
stand
so
far
as
the
indictment
is
concern
and
it
would
state
a
charge
under
the
assault
statute.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
but
of
course
if
i
never
assault
mr.
glazer.
i
couldn't
be.
i
--
they
couldn't
prove
the
fact.
i
think
that
would
be
your
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
right,
i
--
we
do
not
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
how
we
do
analyze
what
the
statute
does
encompass
to
illustrate
why
it
is
that
we
do
not
construe
it
to
meet
that
situation.
that
is
to
say
that
even
though
the
indictment
in
the
abstract
would
be
a
perfectly
good
indictment
when
we
went
to
trial,
we
would
not
have
actually
proved
an
offense.
now
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
i
--
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all
and
if
--
i
think
i
can
make
this
clear
with
a
very
small
amount
of
elaboration.
there
are
as
we
conceive
of
it,
five
elements
in
the
offense
and
it
is
the
fifth
element
which
is
the
one
that
--
the
ones
that's
crucial.
let
me
first
put
aside
the
first
four
because
i
don't
think
there
are
any
dispute
about
those
and
i
don't
think
that
they
should
trouble
us
here.
first
of
course
is
the
statute
applies
to
any
person
except
the
common
carrier.
there
was
some
allegation
in
the
lower
court
that
it
only
applies
to
gangsters
and
professional
criminals
but
that's
no
longer
alleged.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
applies
to
anyone
who
does
certain
acts
unless
he's
a
common
carrier.
of
course
it
also
requires
interstate
transportation.
that's
not
disputed.
also
and
this
is
not
disputed
it
requires
scienter
that
you
must
--
the
person
involve
must
have
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
materials
he
is
transporting
and
intent
to
transport
it.
and
fourth,
it
only
covers
the
enumerated,
the
described
materials,
the
paraphernalia,
papers,
writings
etcetera.
and
fifth,
and
this
is
crucial.
it
only
covers
those
materials
knowingly
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
if
they
have
a
certain
function
that
is
proscribed
by
the
statute,
i
can
illustrate
this
in
two
ways,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
of
a
type
of
paper
that's
highly
flammable,
if
you
touch
a
cigarette
to
it
it'll
burn
out
quickly.
this
is
known
as
flash
paper.
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
flash
paper
is
very
useful
in
bookmaking
operations
because
bookmakers
can
keep
there
records
on
it
and
in
the
case
of
a
raid
all
they
have
to
do
is
touch
a
cigarette
to
it
and
the
records
are
destroyed,
the
evidence
is
destroyed.
now
if
a
person
is
alleged
to
have
carried
a
package
of
flash
paper
in
inter
--
knowingly
have
alleged
to
have
carried
a
package
of
flash
paper
in
interstate
commerce,
he
comes
within
the
first
four
elements
of
the
offense.
but
unless
it
is
also
alleged
that
that
flash
paper
had
a
function
which
is
proscribed
in
the
act,
for
example,
used
in
bookmaking,
a
violation
of
the
act
is
not
made
out.
you
can
carry
a
flash
paper
for
use
in
a
magic
show
for
example
or
some
other
theatrical
production.
for
the
same
thing
--
the
same
type
of
analysis
applies
to
these
acknowledgements
of
purchase.
if
i
carry
acknowledgements
of
purchase
across
the
state
line
for
use
in
building
a
bonfire
for
example
and
the
indictment
only
alleges
that's
the
use
i'm
making
of
it,
then
i
haven't
committed
an
offense
under
the
statute
and
the
indictment
doesn't
charge.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
exactly,
and
that's
the
essential
element.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
right.
and
it
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
but
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
indeed
the
contrary.
the
mere
fact
that
this
is
a
piece
of
paper
that
has
written
on
it
the
words
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
that
these
pieces
of
paper
with
those
words
written
on
it
are
carried
in
interstate
commerce
is
not
sufficient.
we
must
allege
as
we
do
and
we
must
prove
as
we
expect
to
that
this
piece
of
paper
or
this
75
pieces
of
papers
were
to
be
used
or
adapted
for
use
in
the
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
let
me
try
to
restate
the
position
i
am
--
i
am
taking
in
trial
to
make
it
abundantly
clear.
the
only
argument
for
the
propositions
that
an
individual
who
buys
his
own
ticket
at
the
sweepstakes
and
then
carries
the
receipt
back
to
the
district
of
columbia,
lets
say
does
not
violate
the
act.
the
only
--
the
reason
that
we
take
that
position
is
a
factual
one.
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
commission
has
and
this
is
--
there's
no
dispute
about
this,
has
attempted
to
build
into
its
sweepstakes
operations
certain
safeguards
so
that
its
purchasers
will
avoid
as
much
as
possible
conflict
with
the
laws
of
other
states,
conflicts
with
the
federal
--
with
the
federal
laws.
they
have
notified
--
they
notified
there
--
the
people
who
purchase
sweepstakes
tickets
and
get
these
acknowledgements
that
while
we
cannot
give
advice
on
the
laws
of
all
the
states,
if
there
is
any
doubt
in
your
mind
that
the
carriage
or
possession
of
this
acknowledgement
will
in
your
home
state
constitute
a
violation
of
that
law,
leave
it
here,
don't
carry
it.
in
other
words,
because
of
the
way
that
sweepstakes
commission
has
set
up
there
sweepstakes
i
think
it
--
i
think
that
in
a
case
of
the
individual
who
buys
this
ticket
and
goes
back
home
with
it,
when
that
case
goes
to
trial
i
think
the
government
would
have
an
extraordinarily
difficult
time
to
show
the
requisite
wagering
function
of
that
document.
now,
let
me
compare
another
type
of
operation,
a
private
numbers
--
private
numbers
game
--.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
it
is
our
condition
--
it
is
our
contention
that
it
must
have
some
wagering
function.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
now
that's
the
point
where
--
that's
the
point
where
we
disagree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
let
me
in
response
to
that
make
four
additional
statements
not
to
repeat
anything
that
i've
said
already.
in
the
first
place,
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
a
pleading
is
not
an
issue
in
this
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
the
construction
of
section
1953,
what
does
that
cover?
now
the
problem
that
you're
raising,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
contend
relates
to
in
one
respect
perhaps
is
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
a
pleading
but
i
think
even
more
directly
to
the
factual
question
of
what
is
the
function
of
new
hampshire's
acknowledgement
of
purchase?
now
it's
a
question
of
--
that's
a
question
of
fact.
when
i
responded
to
your
question
as
to
whether
the
individual
purchaser
would
be
liable
under
the
statute.
i
was
doing
that
on
an
--
on
my
own
assumption
as
to
what
the
fact
is.
how
--
what
this
piece
of
paper
in
the
abstract
mean
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
of
course
that's
not
an
issue
involved
here.
it's
not
what
the
--
what
in
fact
this
acknowledgement
is.
it's
whether
we
allege
in
our
indictment
all
of
the
necessary
elements
of
section
1953
as
your
honors
are
to
construe
it.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
and
again
in
reference
to
your
problem
mr.
justice
fortas
is
this.
any
time
you
have
a
criminal
statute
which
draws
a
sharp
line
as
it
should
between
what
is
illegal
on
the
one
hand
and
what
is
legal
on
the
other
hand
you're
bound
to
have
a
cluster
of
cases
at
the
borderline
that
might
post
difficult.
it
might
be
a
little
close
in
interpretation
one
way
or
the
other
indeed
might
even
raise
constitutional
questions.
but
it's
never
been
and
this
is
so
in
any
criminal
statute
that
sharply
defines
the
line
of
illegality.
but
it's
never
been
held
that
because
at
the
borderline
there
might
be
difficulties
and
there
might
be
problems
that
when
we're
dealing
with
a
case
that
is
quite
four
square
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
we
--
that
we
in
any
way
modify
the
position
that
we
would
take
in
that
case.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
to
wit
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
indeed,
to
wit:
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
that
brings
us
to
the
dispute
that
we
really
have
in
this
case,
whether
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
is
the
kind
of
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
contemplated
by
the
statute.
we
allege
that
it
had
a
function
in
that
sweepstakes.
in
our
view
this
is
a
sufficient
allegation
under
the
statute.
the
appellee
says
this
is
not
a
sufficient
because
in
their
understanding
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
as
encompassed
in
section
1953
means
an
illegal
wagering
pool,
illegal
under
the
laws
of
the
state
where
it
originates.
now
that's
where
we
really
have
a
dispute
here.
that's
the
legal
question
that
brings
us
to
this
court
mr.
justice.
we
contend
that
the
statute
applies
to
wit:
any
papers
that
have
a
use
in
any
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
regardless
of
whether
that
wagering
pool
is
legal
within
its
state
of
origin
or
not.
in
our
view,
the
legality
of
a
wagering
enterprise
within
its
home
state
is
not
material
to
the
definition
of
the
offense
in
1953
because
section
1953
only
comes
into
a
--
only
comes
into
operation
when
gambling
transcends
state
boundaries.
the
--
and
this
is
the
situation
that
happened
here.
we
have
a
crossing
of
state
boundaries.
now
i
think
we
can
look
to
the
--
all
of
the
typical
indicia
for
--
of
congressional
intent
and
congressional
meanig
and
find
that
any
wagering
pool
whether
its
legal
in
the
state
of
operation
or
illegal
in
the
state
of
operation,
its
contemplated
here.
let
me
say
at
the
outset
of
course
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
is
legal
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
but
it's
not
in
any
way
unique
in
this
respect.
there
are
more
than
75
countries
and
i
(inaudible)
that
this
statute
covers
interstate
as
well
as
foreign
commerce.
more
that
75
countries
have
legal
sweepstakes
or
lottery
operations
including
mexico,
our
very
near
neighbor
to
the
south.
in
addition
to
what
you
might
call
a
strictly
foreign
country,
the
american
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
has
for
many
years
had
its
--
has
a
legal
sweepstakes.
and
it
come
even
closer
to
home,
the
state
of
nevada
presently
and
certainly
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
licensed
bookmaking
and
sporting
pools.
and
both
of
this
operations,
bookmaking
and
sporting
pools
are
covered
by
section
1953.
so,
the
state
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
stand
out
any
unique
--
doesn't
put
itself
in
any
unique
position
because
gambling
is
legalized
there.
the
same
is
true
as
they
say
in
many
countries,
in
puerto
rico
and
nevada
and
of
course
conceivably
so
in
any
state
of
the
union.
the
statute
itself
of
course,
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
legal
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
it
just
says
wagering
pools
with
respect
with
sporting
events.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
pardon
me?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
it's
a
--
subsequent.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
statute
was
enacted
in
1961.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
was
part
of
the
background
that
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
there
--
there's
an
explicit
legislative
history
on
the
question
that
i'm
directly
focusing
on.
we
cited
in
a
--
footnote
8,
page
11
and
8
of
our
briefs,
senator
kefauver
was
asking
a
question
about
the
statute
to
assist
an
attorney
general
miller.
that
time
he
was
the
head
of
the
criminal
division
and
he
was
the
department
spokesman
at
the
senate
hearing.
senator
kefauver
said
and
inquired
whether
this,
"bookmaking,
wagering
pool
and
so
forth
mean
where
it
is
not
legal
by
state
law."
mr.
miller's
response
to
this,
and
again
i
quote,
"unequivocal."
"no
sir."
that
provision
is
not
in
there.
it
was
the
position
of
the
department
that
these
types
of
paraphernalia,
records
and
other
devices
should
be
barred
from
interstate
commerce.
so,
there
was
--
the
question
that
is
at
issue
here
was
directly
put
at
least
one
time
during
the
hearings
on
the
bill
and
directly
answered
by
a
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
they're
all
part
of
it
and
there's
more
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
also.
the
--
before
i
turning
there,
let
me
focus
again
on
some
of
the
language
in
the
statute
which
of
course
is
the
first
stop
on
the
way
of
finding
out
what
congress
meant.
the
statute
doesn't
distinguish
between
illegal
wagering
pools
and
the
legal
wagering
pools
but
it
does
create
certain
exceptions
for
certain
types
of
wagering.
accepts
--
over
a
certain
types
of
wagering
and
certain
types
of
paraphernalia,
for
example
in
the
paraphernalia
category,
it
accepts
the
carriage
of
newspapers.
this
primarily
was
out
of
concern
for
freedom
of
the
press.
they
didn't
want
have
any
--
any
crimp
on
that
protected
right
at
all.
in
addition,
congress
carved
out
an
exception
for
legal
pari-mutuel
betting
material
and
this
is
the
one
that
i
think
is
of
some
special
relevance
here,
for
the
carrying
of
materials
to
be
used
in
the
placing
of
bets
on
a
sporting
event
into
a
state
where
such
betting
is
legal
by
statute.
now
when
congress
set
up
this
very
narrow
and
very
carefully
drawn
pattern
of
exceptions,
it
cannot
be
said
that
they
--
that
the
courts
are
free
to
imply
by
some
form
of
interpolation
a
further
exception
not
set
out
by
congress
for
the
carriage
of
wagering
materials
from
a
state
where
those
materials
are
legal.
in
fact
if
that
were
--
if
that
exception,
the
exception
for
carrying
materials
from
a
state
where
they're
legal
or
in
the
act
it
would
do
great
damage
if
not
completely
nullify
the
act
itself
because
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
no.
pari-mutuel
is
a
very
clearly
defined
termed.
it
involves
among
the
elements
in
the
pari-mutuel
betting
scheme
or
betting
act
a
race
track
or
at
the
place
where
the
sporting
event
takes
place.
and
the
betting
takes
place
very
shortly
before
the
particular
sporting
event,
usually
at
the
race,
the
horse
race,
or
dog
race.
the
betting
takes
place
almost
immediately
prior
to
the
event
on
which
the
price
turns
and
the
price
--
and
the
only
place
you
can
pay
--
the
only
place
you
can
collect
as
well
as
the
only
place
you
can
buy
ticket
is
at
the
race
track.
there's
really
very
little
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
the
same
is
true
in
nevada
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
nevada,
that's
been
the
case
in
nevada
for
many
years.
it
was
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
and
there
was
of
course
a
discussion
about
it
in
the
hearing.
nevada
legalizes
off
track
betting
and
there
is
an
exception
in
the
statute
for
the
carriage
of
material
relating
to
wagering
into
such
a
state.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
bring
in
papers
that
the
nevada
bookmakers
use
to
keep
their
records
on,
you
bring
it
into
nevada,
there
is
no
violation
of
statute.
but
to
extend
what
is
legal
in
nevada
to
the
other
states
would
violate
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
if
i'm
right.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
i
think
it
was
recognized
that
the
--
there
is
very
minimal
danger
of
trafficking
in
the
pari-mutuel
ticket.
that
pari-mutuel
betting
itself
--
well
first
of
all,
by
the
way,
the
exception
is
not
for
any
pari-mutuel
betting
but
only
for
legal
pari-mutuel
betting.
but
legal
pari-mutuel
betting
was
not
considered
by
the
senators
and
congressmen
who
addressed
themselves
to
this
issue
as
being
an
evil
where
the
states
sought
to
--
saw
fit
to
legalize
this
type
of
operation
which
is
quite
closely
confined
to
a
single
place,
a
race
track.
the
senators
and
congressmen
felt
there
was
a
no
need
for
the
federal
government
to
enter
into
this
area.
in
addition
of
course
that
its
well-known
and
it
was
mentioned
in
the
hearing
that
there
are
a
number
of
race
track
that
are
located
near
state
line
so
that
everyday
people
go
from
the
district
of
columbia
perhaps
to
laurel,
maryland
or
to
charles
town,
west
virginia
and
there's
a
lot
of
interstate
commerce
involved
here.
but
in
essence
all
we're
doing
is
--
all
that's
involved
is
a
simple
--
singly
located
pari-mutuel
operation
and
they
wanted
to
--
they
want
to
exempt
that.
quite
in
contrast
to
that
is
many
sweepstakes
and
certainly
the
new
hampshire
operation
where
there's
--
in
one
instance
an
11
month
period
of
buying
tickets
are
--
and
the
second
is
that
this
year,
a
six
month
period
of
buying
tickets
as
opposed
to
pari-mutuel
situation
where
you
buy
your
ticket
before
the
race.
the
race
is
run,
you
either
win
or
you
lose.
i
think
these
are
the
considerations
that
were
expressed
and
entered
the
minds
of
the
legislators
on
this
subject.
but
the
--
there
is
a
--
they
say
an
exemption
for
carrying
materials
into
a
place
such
as
nevada
or
indeed
into
new
hampshire
for
use
in
this
state
legalized
operations.
but
when
the
--
when
there's
a
possibility
of
opening
a
base
camp,
let
us
say
a
bookmaker,
opening
up
a
headquarters
in
nevada
but
all
legal
bookmaking
material
were
exempt
--
were
exempted
from
the
statute
whether
it
was
coming
into
nevada
or
going
out
from
nevada
this
would
be
a
boon
to
nevada
bookmakers
because
they
could
open
up
a
headquarters
there
and
operate
in
other
states
in
violation
of
those
state
laws
from
that
camp.
all
they
have
to
worry
of
course
are
the
laws
of
the
other
states
which
the
--
this
statute
among
other
things
was
designed
to
fortify,
to
assist
them.
its
not
at
all
surprising
i
might
--
i
should
note,
as
we
do
note
in
our
brief
that
congress
would
pass
a
statute
prohibiting
the
interstate
transportation
of
material
that
in
its
inception
at
least
is
related
to
a
legal
wagering
pool
or
a
legal
sporting
operation.
because
for
over
90
years
congress
has
had
a
statute
which
has
prohibited
the
mailing
of
material
that
is
connected
to
legal
lotteries
or
legal
wagering
pools.
now
this
statute
has
been
--
had
been
very
narrowly
construed,
this
is
now
in
the
u.s.
code
in
section
1301
through
1305.
the
statute
is
not
nearly
as
broad
as
1953.
it
doesn't
cover
all
the
paraphernalia
and
materials
that
related
primarily
to
lottery
tickets
or
things
that
could
be
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
represent
a
lottery
ticket.
congress
was
disturbed
and
discussed
at
great
length
the
limitations
that
had
been
placed
on
the
prior
statute.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
1953
was
to
plug
the
loop
holes
that
had
been
opened
up
the
earlier
legislation.
but
for
our
purposes
here
it's
only
relevant
to
know
that
the
earlier
and
this
is
not
at
all
contested.
it's
recognized
in
the
briefs
of
the
other
side.
here
the
statutes
did
apply
to
the
mailing
of
for
example
irish
sweepstakes
ticket.
irish
sweepstakes
are
perfectly
legal
in
ireland.
but
when
they're
to
be
mailed
out
of
that
country
here,
they
violate
--
they
had
for
many
years
violated
section
1301.
and
now
the
same
thing,
if
interstate
transportation
is
involved
would
violate
section
1953.
the
course
the
same
is
true,
we
contend
with
respect
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
there's
no
real
difference
for
these
purposes.
one
point
is
dwelled
upon
at
great
length
in
appellee's
briefs
and
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
that
is
the
discussion
in
the
legislative
hearings
and
the
senate
on
how
--
about
organized
crime.
well
it
is
true
that
organized
crime
was
considered
a
very
serious
problem
by
the
legislators
who
enacted
this
statute
and
certainly
that
one
of
the
aims
of
the
statute
was
to
put
a
crimp
into
the
operations
of
organized
criminal
syndicates.
but
the
statute
went
and
plainly
so
went
farther
than
that
very,
very
limited
purpose.
it
clearly
was
intended
to
apply
as
was
recognized
in
the
hearings
to
an
individual
bookmaker
or
individual
operator
of
the
lottery.
it
was
not
connected
with
any
syndicate.
the
point
was
to
close
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
to
gambling
operations
which
otherwise
would
transcends
state
lines.
subsidiary
purpose
was
to
assist
the
states
of
the
union
and
by
far
the
majority
of
the
states
and
the
union
prohibit
off
track
betting.
all
of
them
prohibit
strictly
a
numbers
game
and
most
of
them
prohibit
lottery
operations.
the
idea
was
to
assist
this
states
in
the
enforcement
of
there
statutes
as
something
that
would
be
defeated
if
as
an
example
i
gave
before
i
--
bookmaker
in
nevada
were
allowed
freely
to
operate
throughout
the
country
from
that
home
base.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no
constitutional
argument
has
been
made
at
any
time
in
this
case.
no
question
was
raised
at
all.i
think
on
this
last
point
i
--
the
state
of
new
hampshire
itself
i
believe
has
recognized
the
problem
of
the
conflict
that
could
occur
when
one
state
legalizes
a
form
or
all
forms
indeed
of
gambling.
and
the
other
states
in
the
union
maintain
there
prohibitions
against
gambling.
shortly
after
the
sweepstakes
was
initiated
i
think
in
1964
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
commission
sent
out
a
memorandum
to
prosecuting
and
law
enforcement
officers
in
all
the
states
describing
the
sweepstakes
operations
and
explaining
the
safeguards
that
were
attempted
to
be
build
into
the
operations
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
state
law.
but
they
did
point
out
and
properly
so
and
i
read
briefly
from
the
memorandum.
when
one
state
permits
the
sale
of
sweepstakes
or
lottery
tickets
and
others
prohibits
such
sale
the
primary
danger
is
that
tickets
purchased
lawfully
in
new
hampshire
would
be
resold
unlawfully
elsewhere.
and
this
danger
that
new
hampshire
recognized
is
precisely
one
of
the
dangers
which
the
members
of
congress
recognized
when
they
passed
1953.
now,
in
closing
i
would
like
to
return
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
you
read
my
mind
mr.
justice,
this
was
--
this
exactly
was
the
point
out
i
was
about
to
make.
that
is
correct.
this
statute
i
should
point
out
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
appellee
made
his
trip
from
new
york
to
new
hampshire
and
back.
it
was
enacted
after
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
filed.
but
at
the
present
time
there
is
a
statute
in
new
hampshire
which
prohibits
the
business
of
selling
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
in
any
manner
except
by
the
way
that
the
sweepstakes
commission
sets
it
up
itself.
in
other
words,
someone
who
is
not
an
agent
of
the
state
is
prohibited
from
going
into
the
business
of
selling
these
tickets.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
acknowledgement
is
non-saleable
and
non-transferable.
but
of
course
a
person
can
sell
a
ticket,
indeed
a
person
who
sells
any
item
under
certain
circumstances
without
there
being
a
physical
transfer.
so,
it
is
possible
for
me
to
travel
from
new
hampshire
back
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
to
offer
to
sell
to
someone
here
and
to
actually
make
a
sale
to
someone
here
of
a
sweepstakes
ticket
even
though
the
ticket
itself
remains
in
new
hampshire.
what
i
have
accomplished
is
the
same
thing.
i
have
enabled
that
person
to
place
a
bet
on
the
sweepstakes.
and
the
--
at
the
same
time
i
have
earned
a
commission
for
myself
or
for
those
services.
what
i
have
to
prove
to
him
and
satisfy
him
that
i
have
actually
carried
out
his
order,
that
i've
actually
placed
a
bet
that
he
requested
i
placed.
i
have
an
acknowledgement
of
purchase
which
verifies
that
his
name
and
his
address
are
inscribed
on
a
ticket
in
the
possession
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
i
would
--
i
will
answer
your
question
directly
but
i
think
to
avoid
misleading
i
must
make
one
preparatory
statement.
the
situation
that
you
described
as
some
of
the
others
you've
mentioned
do
go
to
a
border
line
situation
under
the
statute.
we
construe
the
statute
to
apply
to
the
knowing
carriage
of
papers,
paraphernalia
etcetera
in
interstate
commerce
where
those
papers
and
paraphernalia
have
a
wagering
function.
now
i
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
situation
you've
describe
would
be
a
case
where
there
is
a
wagering
function
in
that
paper.
it
does
facilitate
the
other
state
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh
no,
it
must
be
a
function
in
either
bookmaking
or
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
a
numbers
game
or
waging
pool.
in
this
case
it
must
be
a
function
of
a
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
as
we
allege.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
statute
applies
where
the
papers
have
a
wagering
function.
now
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
state
of
--
in
fact
i
note
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
that
appellee
from
what
they
said
in
their
briefs
would
disagree
with
you
on
the
fact
of
whether
this
particular
paper
has
a
wagering
function.
well,
i
understand
and
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
that
factual
issue
is
a
matter
that
must
be
resolved
here,
for
the
position
of
this
case.
i
would
point
out
one
other
point
in
relation
to
the
questions
you've
ask.
now
i
realize
again
this
is
not
directly
relate
to
the
problem
in
this
court,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
this
statute
was
drawn
broadly
and
decidedly
so
to
eliminate
as
much
as
possible
loop
holes
which
had
appeared
in
the
earlier
statute
as
a
result
of
its
breath
this
was
recognized
as
was
mentioned
expressly
by
attorney
general
kennedy
in
his
opening
testimony
in
the
senate
and
it
was
also
discussed
in
a
memorandum
which
the
department
of
justice
sent
to
u.s.
attorneys
across
the
country
after
the
statute
was
passed
and
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
as
a
result
of
this
breath,
it
was
recognized
that
there
would
be
cases
of
the
sort
you
described
not
only
in
relation
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
but
in
relation
to
clearly
illegal
activity.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
that's
right.
not
only
in
relation
to
sweepstakes,
legal
sweepstakes
such
as
puerto
--
perhaps
more
appropriate
puerto
rico,
irish
sweepstakes,
the
other
legal
sweepstakes
that
were
existent
in
the
similar
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
--
i'll
try
keep
a
straight
face
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
think
that
they
--
the
congress
viewed
--
would
have
viewed
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
the
same
light
as
it
viewed
legal
bookmaking
in
nevada
and
the
legal
sweepstakes
indeed
the
irish
sweepstakes
as
mentioned
half
dozen
times
in
the
hearing.
illegal
sweepstakes
operating
in
various
foreign
countries
that
is
to
say
would
have
viewed
them
as
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
and
where
this
operations
legal
in
the
area
where
they
were
--
where
they
originated.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
--
well,
the
same
is
true
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
same
is
true
to
the
other
--
to
the
mexican
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
it's
unique
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
it's
not
unique
now,
its
not
--
it's
not
unique
and
its
not
--
it's
certainly
not
unique
in
our
history.
many
states
have
operated
lotteries.
i
think
the
list
at
one
time
was
up
to
a
dozen
at
various
time.
now
it
is
unique
in
the
1960's
but
there
have
been
state
lottery.
i
think
what
congress
has
clearly
had
in
mind
was
that
when
you're
talking
about
operations
which
transcends
state
borders
and
when
you
have
as
we
do
have
in
this
country
the
overwhelming
majority
of
state
prohibiting
lotteries,
bookmaking,
this
other
forms
of
wagering
covered
by
1953
that
whatever
you
can
say
about
the
policy
of
the
state
which
legalizes
or
indeed
sponsors
and
operates
a
certain
form
of
wagering,
you
still
--
as
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concern
cannot
close
out
the
dangers
that
there
will
be
an
impingement
upon
the
policies
of
the
other
states
when
interstate
commerce
is
involved.
i
would
have
--
i
have
no
hesitation
in
answering
your
question
whether
congress
would
have
enacted
the
statute
the
same
way
in
relation
to
the
new
hampshire's
sweepstakes
had
it
been
in
operation
with
the
(inaudible).
indeed
there
have
been
several
bills
introduced
in
recent
years
to
carve
out
an
exemption
for
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
relation
to
the
mailing
statute,
the
mailing
of
lottery
materials.
these
have
not
passed.
one
statute
has
passed
exempting
the
new
hampshire's
sweepstakes
from
the
wagering
tax
operation
but
there
is
a
proviso
in
that
which
says
that
this
only
goes
to
officials
and
agents
of
the
state
that's
operating
the
sweepstakes
itself.
they
--
congress
obviously
recognized
that
even
where
a
state
legalizes
and
sponsors
a
sweepstakes
there
maybe
outsiders
who
could
take
advantage
of
that
operation
for
their
own
private
purpose.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
that
--
that's
what
we
contend
happened
here.
that
there
is
--
although
new
hampshire
does
protect
itself
to
the
large
extent
there
is
this
one
area
where
sales
can
be
consummated
outside
of
the
state
through
private
agents.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
would
doubt
that
the
gentleman
from
new
hampshire
and
of
course
he
can
speak
to
that
better
than
i
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
function
and
there
is
not
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
it
said
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
presented
to
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
well
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
once
your
name
is
on
the
ticket
but
there
is
the
question
of
how
do
you
decide
--
how
do
determine
whose
name
goes
on
those
tickets
and
whose
name
don't
go
on
the
ticket.
well,
there
--
the
state
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
control
that.
the
person
who
comes
to
the
machine
writes
the
name
and
address
on
the
ticket.
now
if
before
coming
to
that
machine
he
has
made
arrangements
in
other
states
for
a
fee
or
for
a
commission
to
travel
to
new
hampshire
and
to
purchase
tickets
for
these
absentee
purchasers
he
may
very
well
be
violating
the
laws
of
other
states.
indeed
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs
we
be
violating
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
we
contend
that
this
is
a
violation
as
we
alleged
here
of
section
1953.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
of
course
well
when
it
--
yes
that's
right,
when
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
it's
--
among
the
elements
in
the
offense
is
the
interstate
transportation
of
these
materials
for
a
proscribed
purpose
and
it's
the
arrangements
relate
to
the
proscribed
purpose
for
which
these
things,
these
objects
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
what
we
allege,
oh
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
the
proscribed
purpose
was
used
in
the
sweepstakes,
was
to
facilitate
wagering
in
the
sweepstakes
and
indeed
it
was
--
it
is
the
arrangements
that
he
made
with
new
york.
it
was
the
customers
in
new
york
that
indicate
that
what
he
was
doing
was
facilitating,
wagering
by
these
persons
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
without
having
them
--
without
requiring
them
to
come
into
the
state.
the
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
well,
the
function
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
we
don't
have
figures
on
how
many
are
bought
but
we
know
how
many
winners
there
are.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
there
17%
of
the
winners
are
in
staters
and
83
are
out
of
state.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
somehow
they
get
--
they
could
travel
to
new
hampshire
and
get
them
of
course
so
they
could
get
them
to
some
other
agencies.
and
we
don't
have
any
figures
on
how
many
get
them
one
way,
how
many
get
them
the
other
way.
but
we
do
strongly
urge
and
in
conclusion
that
an
indictment
which
does
charge
that
an
individual
carries
certain
papers
to
wit
acknowledgements
of
purpose
which
are
alleged
to
be
used
and
devised
and
adapted
and
designed
for
used
in
a
wagering
pool
to
wit
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
does
state
an
offense
under
section
1953.
and
because
of
this
we
would
strongly
urge
that
the
case
be
reversed,
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
we
can
go
to
trial
and
prove
the
allegations
that
we've
made.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
would
do
the
best
i
can.
there's
been
some
confusion
here
to
which
i
have
contributed
to
largely.
between
facts
that
can
be
proven
and
what
the
statute
requires
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
indeed
i
think
we
all
have
used
the
same
phrase
that
an
indictment
charges
an
offense
under
section
1953.
if
it
alleges
that
a
person
knowingly
carries
in
interstate
commerce
certain
paraphernalia
to
be
used
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now,
it
is
our
view
and
this
was
what
i
attempted
to
state
and
answer
to
your
early
question
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact
whether
any
particular
piece
of
paper
or
any
particular
piece
of
paraphernalia
is
to
be
used
in
a
wagering
pool
and
there
may
be
some
dispute
as
there
has
been
this
morning
as
to
whether
just
on
its
face
this
acknowledgement
necessarily
has
a
use
in
the
wagering
pool
or
whether
more
facts
must
be
develop
to
prove
that
use.
now,
i
--
when
i
answered
mr.
justice
fortas'
earlier
question
by
saying
the
tourist
who
goes
in
would
not
violate
the
statute,
i
was
doing
it
on
the
assumption
that
as
to
him
we
could
not
prove
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
has
a
use.
i
may
be
wrong
in
that
assumption
but
i
don't
think
that
that's?
i
don't
think
that's
a
material
here.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no
to
either
one
or
to
two.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
but
two
qualifications
should
be
put
forth.
one,
of
course
they're
still
at
the
question
--
they're
still
at
this
essential
factual
question
whether
this
acknowledgement
was
used
in
that
particular
--
did
have
a
use
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes,
that's
the
question
of
fact.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
right,
but
the
answer
is,
the
answer
is
yes
that
an
indictment
drafted
in
those
terms
could
be
brought
against
that
individual.
i
would
--
then
there's
--
i
still
think
and
i'm
--
and
there's
some
log
ahead
as
to
whether
we
can
prove
our
case.
but
there's
another
point
that
is
made
in
the
brief
that
is
quite
relevant
here.
and
that
is
the
--
although
--
naturally
it
doesn't
go
directly
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
department
of
justice
has
been
on
the
record
since
the
--
not
only
after
the
in
--
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute
but
in
the
legislative
hearings
on
the
statute
that
although
the
statute
would
be
broad
enough
to
cover
that
situation
or
the
person
who
carries
the
numbers
ticket
that
those
persons
would
not
be
prosecuted
as
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
question
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
as
far
as
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
concerned
as
i
indicated
i
believe
that's
correct.i
think
the
point
should
be
made.
i
think
that
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
--
this
is
of
course
the
fact
but
also
as
i
try
to
indicate
for
the
fact
that
border
line
cases
may
arise
under
this
quite
broad
statute.
in
a
way,
takes
away
from
the
meaning
but
then
i
would
like
to
read
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
reason
is
they
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
don't
think
that
--
with
two
differences,
justice
fortas.
i
don't
believe
that
analysis
is
applicable
here.
the
indictment
was
written
the
way
it
is
written
because
the
statute
is
written
the
way
it
is
written.
the
only
wagering
pool
that
we
have
involved
here
and
we
will
say
that
we
have
no
proof
that
mr.
fabrizio
himself
was
setting
up
a
different
pool,
the
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
involved
in
this
case
on
its
fact
with
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
and
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendant,
mr.
fabrizio,
is
carrying
paraphernalia
to
be
used
in
that
pool.
this
meets
the
--
these
meets
the
terms
of
the
statute
completely
and
the
reason
that
nothing
more
was
said
was
the
government's
view
that
nothing
more
need
be
said.
seems
to
be
contended,
well
it
is
indeed
contended
by
appellee
that
one
thing
more
has
to
be
said.
we
have
to
say
illegal
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
or
some
other
wagering
pool
than
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
this
issue
which
the
central
legal
issue
presented
in
this
case
has
been
debated
and
i
think
we
have
indicated
that
this
--
the
congress
intended
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
to
mean
any
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event,
the
irish
sweepstakes
was
mentioned
expressly
in
the
statute
as
being
an
example
of
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
so
far
as
the
way
the
connection
with
sporting
event
is
concern
is
the
same.
may
i
make
two
statements
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
sir.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
can
say
this
is
in
terms
of
what
was
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
they
enacted
the
statute.
it
was
a
proliferation
of
gambling
operations
beyond
the
borders
of
a
single
state
into
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
that
disturbed
them.
i
think
that
if
the
history
of
our
society
was
that
nobody
was
interested
in
buying
tickets
in
other
states,
the
sweepstakes
congress
may
have
not
been
concerned
that
there
was
a
problem
and
may
not
have
passed
the
statute.
if
i
think
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
understand.
i
--
well,
i
think
what
you
suggest
--
what
your
question
suggest
to
me
is
that
--
is
that
realistically
and
this
is
something
that
congress
had
in
mind.
you
can't
think
about
the
situation
where
other
--
the
de
minimus
situation
where
there's
only
going
to
be
one
potential
violator
involved.
there
are
numerous
potential
violators.
indeed
the
83%
of
the
winners
from
out
of
state
who
have
gained
profit
on
the
sweepstakes
conceivably
may
have
been
involved
in
violations
themselves,
a
certain
part
of
it.
so
it's
not
just
--
just
the
case
of
one
man
with
one
ticket.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
know
of
none
--
person
but
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
that's
--
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
equipped
to
satisfy
you
on
that
particular
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
think
it
--
it
is
clear,
it
was
made
clear
in
the
hearings
on
this
case
that
the
government
is
interested
in
that.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
in
the
lotteries
of
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
as
i
say
i'
m
not
prepared
to
say
that
--
and
nothing
happened.
i'm
not
--
i
have
no
knowledge
bearing
on
your
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh!
oh,
indeed,
indeed,
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
mr.
chief
justice
i
don't
mean
and
i
hope
i'm
not
leaving
the
impression
that
that
there
is
no
interest
in
that
of
the
government
i
just
--
and
i
just
do
not
have
at
hand
the
information
to
direct
to
that
question.
i
think
it
is
--
so
far
as
the
direct
question
involved
here,
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
and
there
was
--
i'm
convinced
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
members
of
congress,
the
statute
was
designed
to
cover
irish
sweepstakes,
other
foreign
country
sweepstakes,
other
legal
sweepstakes
for
example
puerto
rico
just
as
well
as
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i'll
do
my
very
best
to
provide
that
information
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
and
--
yes,
i
would,
yes
we
shall
provide
that
information.
i
would
submit
of
course
that
the
absence
of
prosecutions
of
any
number
of
violators
of
the
statute
doesn't
read
on
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
let
me
--
may
i
--
may
i
in
conclusion
make
the
three
points
well
i
believe
at
least
in
my
understanding
of
the
operation
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
yes,
i
under
--
directing
to
the
statements
that
mr.
millimet
made
which
i
--
as
i
understand
them
are
in
--
are
inaccurate.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
one,
that
you
can
only
--
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
more
than
10
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
is
to
go
the
commission
and
buy
a
bulk
order.
i
understand
that
that's
not
the
case
that
the
machines
are
only
activated
for
10
tickets
sales
at
a
time.
but
if
a
person
for
example
wanted
to
buy
20
tickets
at
a
liquor
store,
he
could
do
that
by
paying
a
clerk
$30,
writing
out
10
tickets,
returning
to
the
clerk
and
paying
30
more
dollars
and
writing
out
20
more
tickets
that
you
don't
have
to
buy
--
that
if
you
--
you
can
buy
more
than
10
other
than
by
going
in
and
registering
with
the
commission.
mr.
millimet
also
suggests
that
if
what
new
hampshire
had
was
a
lottery
rather
than
a
sweepstakes
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
act.
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
covered
by
the
second,
the
lower
down
section
of
the
act
which
applies
to
numbers,
policy
and
similar
games
that
a
lottery
is
similar
to
a
numbers
game
and
if
the
drawing
based
on
the
face
--
on
the
number.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
by
the
district
court.
that
court
decision
was
bases
upon
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
was
founded
that
is
18
u.s.
code
section
1953
and
the
only
question
before
this
court
on
direct
appeal
is
the
interpretation
of
that
statute.
so
far
as
it
is
relevant
here,
section
1953
prohibits
anyone
except
the
common
carrier
in
the
usual
course
of
this
business
form
knowingly
transporting
in
interstate
commerce
"any
record,
paraphernalia,
ticket,
certificate,
bills,
slip,
token,
paper,
writing
or
other
device
used
or
to
be
used
or
adapted
device
or
design
for
used
in
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event."
the
indictment
which
the
lower
court
dismissed
closely
parallel
to
statutory
language,
it
alleges
that
on
or
about
august
24
1964,
anthony
l.
fabrizio,
the
appellee,
knowingly
carried
in
interstate
commerce
from
keene,
new
hampshire
to
elmira,
new
york
"records,
papers
writings,
to
wit:
75
acknowledgments
of
purchase
for
a
sweepstakes
race
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
to
be
used,
and
adapted,
devised
and
designed
for
use,
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event,"
that
is:
a
sweepstakes
race
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
indictment
was
filed
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
september
1964.
in
october
1964,
appellee
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
of
his
former
counsel
setting
forth
appellee's
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
section
1953.
the
government
filed
a
memorandum
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
motion
was
submitted
on
the
papers
without
oral
argument.
on
october
5,
1965
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
stating
only
the
following
reason
"the
charge
in
the
indictment
does
not
come
within
the
purpose
of
section
1953
as
disclosed
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
court
did
not
further
elaborate
the
position."
under
the
limiting
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
under
which
this
direct
appeal
is
brought
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
a
pleading
is
not
before
this
court
and
neither
is
the
question
whether
the
government
can
adduce
sufficient
proof
to
establish
its
factual
allegations.
stated
concretely
the
only
question
involved
here
is
the
following,
does
an
indictment
alleging
the
knowing
interstate
carriage
of
acknowledgements
of
purchase
to
be
used
an
adapted
device
and
designed
for
use
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
state
a
crime
under
section
1953?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
it
is.
i'm
printing
that
now
mr.
justice.
so
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
briefly
sketch
the
mechanics
of
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
operation
and
to
touch
upon
the
function
therein
of
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
which
is
the
paper
that
appellee
carried
in
interstate
commerce.
after
doing
this
i'll
turn
to
the
legal
questions
involved
in
the
case.
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
is
operated
by
the
new
hampshire
commission
established
by
law.
it
is
by
undoubted
--
undeniably
a
legal
operation
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
maybe
purchased
at
the
sweepstakes
commission
headquarters
at
51
state
liquor
stores,
two
race
tracks
and
two
highway
toll
plazas
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
tickets
are
in
the
first
instance
contained
in
a
specially
designed
ticket
dispensing
machine
which
is
very
much
like
the
airline
insurance
policy
dispensing
machine
that
is
quite
common.
the
sweepstakes
ticket
itself,
now
i
have
a
copy
of
the
ticket
here
which
you
may
not
all
be
able
to
see
but
the
facsimile
of
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
appears
on
the
page
nine
in
the
record
in
it's
a
--
as
i
will
point
out
the
differences
and
similarities
it
may
be
easier
to
refer
to
that
rather
than
to
--
what
i
have
in
my
hand.
in
the
machine
when
one
first
approaches
the
machine
through
an
opening
at
the
top
the
sweepstakes
ticket
appears
in
such
a
manner
that
one
can
write
the
required
information
on
the
face
of
the
ticket.
now
immediately
beneath
that
ticket
in
the
machine
is
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
which
is
essentially
identical,
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment
the
differences.
this
is
not
visible
to
the
purchaser,
it's
inside
the
machine
underneath
the
ticket
and
it's
put
there
so
that
one
writing
on
the
ticket
will
make
a
carbon
copy
and
pressure
it
on
the
same
lines
on
the
acknowledgement.
the
information
asked
on
the
ticket
as
the
copy
on
page
nine
shows
is
the
name,
address,
city
and
state.
when
a
person
wants
to
buy
a
sweepstakes
ticket
at
one
of
the
various
locations
where
the
tickets
are
sold,
he
first
goes
to
a
clerk
in
the
store
or
at
the
office
or
at
the
race
track
and
pays
three
dollars
per
ticket.
upon
receiving
the
money
the
clerk
activates
this
ticket
dispensing
machine
for
the
sale
of
--
as
many
tickets
as
the
person
has
paid
for
up
to
10.
the
most
you
can
get
one
stretch
is
10
tickets.
the
purchaser
then
proceeds
to
the
machine
and
writes
on
the
face
of
the
ticket
itself
a
name,
address,
and
a
city
and
a
state.
doesn't
have
to
be
that
persons
own
name
and
address
in
fact
it
doesn't
have
to
be
any
persons'
name
and
address.
it
can
be
a
club
or
a
corporation
or
a
school
or
an
association
or
it
can
be
more
than
one
person,
mister
and
misses
so
and
so.
but
the
name
and
address
that
appears
on
the
ticket
and
simultaneously
is
recorded
on
the
carbon
copy
on
the
acknowledgement
is
crucial
because
the
prizes
on
the
sweepstakes
are
awarded
on
the
basis
of
that
name
and
that
address.
the
--
after
the
person
has
written
the
name
and
address
on
the
ticket
he
pulls
a
lever.
at
that
point
the
ticket
and
the
acknowledgement
part
company,
the
ticket
is
deposited
inside
the
machine,
the
acknowledgment
is
ejected
and
for
the
--
for
whatever
purposes
the
purchaser
wants
to
make
of
it.
at
this
point
let
me
point
out
exactly
where
the
acknowledgement
and
the
sweepstakes
ticket
itself
differ.
they
are
in
fact
identical
with
one
exception
where
the
tickets
has
printed
somewhat
slightly
above
the
top
of
the
top
half
of
the
page
in
large
print
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
ticket.
the
acknowledgement
and
this
is
shown
better
in
the
record
on
page
9
contains
a
legend
which
says
that
this
is
not
a
ticket,
this
is
an
acknowledgement,
you
don't
have
to
present
this
to
win
a
prize,
it
says
as
an
essence.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i'm
about
to
describe
that
actually
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
they
have
--
they
don't
have
to
present
anything.
let
me
make
one
further
point
about
this
acknowledgement
with
reference
to
the
facsimile
in
the
record
just
to
make
it
perfectly
clear.
this
facsimile
in
the
record
is
approximately
the
--
is
almost
exactly
the
actual
size,
there's
a
slight
variation.
in
the
record
there
are
some
parts
of
the
printing
comes
--
come
out
very
prominently,
very
heavy.
other
parts
come
out
very
light.
well,
actually
what
that
represent
is
different
colors.
the
part
that
comes
out
very
heavy
here
is
really
just
red
typed,
the
part
that
comes
out
light
is
blue
typed
so
that
in
the
actual
acknowledgement
this
phrase
that
this
is
only
an
acknowledgement,
it
need
not
be
presented
while
its
quite
clear
does
not
come
out,
thus
not
stand
out
as
prominently
as
it
--
as
one
would
expect
looking
only
at
the
way
the
facsimile
is
recorded
in
the
record.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
this
was
crossed
out
--
blank
out
for
purposes
of
printing
the
record.
there
is
no
reason
to
place
in
the
record
the
name
of
the
person
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
this
was
attached
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
by
appellee
and
i
assume
although
i'm
not
certain
in
it,
appellee's
counsel
may
clear
this
up
and
i
assumed
that
this
was
one
of
the
acknowledgments
that
he
--
one
of
the
75
acknowledgement
he
actually
carried.
so
just
to
preserve
the
identity
of
the
individual
involved
and
since
he
was
not
relevant
they
blanked
that
out.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
blanked
that
out.
but
on
all
acknowledgements
of
course
there
would
be
a
name
and
address
and
then
the
city
and
the
state.
now
this
is
what
happens
and
this
is
directed
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
after
the
lever
is
pulled
the
ticket
is
deposited
within
the
machine
and
the
acknowledgement
is
ejected
outside
the
machine.
let
me
direct
myself
now
only
to
the
ticket,
we'll
leave
acknowledgement
to
one
side
but
the
ticket
is
the
thing
that
counts
as
far
as
winning
the
price
is
concern.
the
tickets
are
deposited
in
the
machine
and
are
collected
by
sweepstakes
commission
agents
periodically.
when
they
are
collected
from
the
machines
they
are
taken
directly
to
bank
deposit
vaults
in
various
parts
of
the
state
and
ultimately
are
gathered
together
in
one
bank
vault
in
manchester,
new
hampshire.
process
of
selling
tickets
in
the
sweepstakes
goes
over
a
relatively
long
period
of
time.
there
where
two
sweepstakes
races
run
this
year.
for
the
first
one,
the
ticket
selling
period
covered
about
an
11
month
period.
but
for
the
second
one,
it
was
about
a
six
month
period.
so
all
this
tickets
over
time
are
collected
and
put
into
the
bank
vault.
finally,
very
shortly
before
the
sweepstake
race
is
run,
the
sweepstakes
race
is
one
of
the
factors
in
determining
who
wins
what
prizes.
very
shortly
before
this
time
the
tickets
are
placed
in
drums
or
barrels
from
which
they
are
to
be
drawn.
shortly
before
the
race,
a
certain
number
of
tickets
are
drawn.
now
the
number
varies
somewhat
depending
on
how
much
money
has
been
put
into
the
pool,
how
much
money
has
been
bet
by
the
various
purchasers.
but
for
simplicities
sake
and
i
think
this
will
serve
our
purposes,
its
fair
to
say
that
there
is
one
ticket
drawn
for
each
horse
nominated
in
the
sweepstake
race.
in
other
words
there
may
be
300
horses
nominated
or
eligible
for
a
running
in
the
particular
race
that's
involved.
if
that's
so,
300
tickets
will
be
drawn
and
each
ticket
will
be
matched
with
one
of
the
eligible
horses.
everyone
whose
ticket
is
thus
drawn
is
entitled
to
some
price
simply
because
his
ticket
is
drawn.
this
year,
in
the
1966
sweepstakes
those
people
whose
tickets
were
drawn
in
the
first
instance
and
didn't
get
any
further
prices
shared
in
a
pool
of
$60,000.
now
after
the
300
tickets
are
drawn,
the
day
of
the
race
comes
and
of
course
300
tickets
--
300
horses
don't
run
on
the
race
only
a
certain
number
of
them,
lets
say
for
example
20,
actually
finally
do
get
entered
into
the
race
and
are
off
when
the
race
is
called.
well,
the
persons
whose
tickets
are
matched
with
these
20
horses
qualify
for
a
higher
price.
this
year
those
persons
shared
in
a
pool
of
$20,000
there.
roughly
their
price
was
something
like
five
or
six
times
more
than
the
people
who
were
matched
with
horses
that
never
ran.
finally
of
course,
there
are
the
top
three
prizes
which
are
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
horses
that
run
first,
second
and
third
in
the
race.
if
my
ticket
was
matched
with
the
horse
that
ran
first,
this
year
i
would've
won
$50,000.
if
i
had
a
ticket
matched
with
the
second
horse,
i
would've
won
$25,000.
if
i
had
a
ticket
matched
with
the
third
horse,
i
would've
won
$12,500.
this
is
the
way
the
winners
are
picked.
now
the
winner
is
determined
by
the
name
and
address
that
appears
on
the
actual
ticket
that
has
been
deposited
in
the
machine,
later
transfer
to
the
safety
deposit
vaults,
later
transferred
to
the
drums
all
within
the
custody
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
all
within
the
custody
of
the
sweepstakes
commission.
the
winners
are
notified
in
the
first
instance
by
telegram
whatever
name
and
address
the
telegram
is
sent
to.
after
it
is
determined
how
much
each
of
these
people
win
depending
on
whether
the
horse
run
at
all
and
if
so
how
it
ran.
whatever
the
price
money
is,
it's
deposited
in
a
new
hampshire
bank,
in
manchester
i
believe
to
the
credit
of
whoever's
name
and
address
or
whatever
group's
name
and
address
appears
on
the
ticket
itself.
then
payment
is
made
through
normal
banking
channels.
now
if
i
live
in
new
hampshire
or
if
i
want
to
travel
up
to
new
hampshire,
if
i
live
in
some
other
state
but
i
wanted
to
go
up
to
new
hampshire
to
collect
my
prize
they
would
write
at
the
bank,
it
would
issue
a
check
and
i
could
just
take
that
from
there.
but
if
i
leave
in
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
same
thing
you
have
to
show
in
any
bank
to
get
any
deposit
out
of
it.
you
simply
identify
yourself
as
the
person
whose
name
and
address
appears
on
this
ticket.
you
do
not
have
to
show
them
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase.
i
think
that
if
--
if
there
was
any
doubt
and
you
did
show
them
the
acknowledgement
of
purchase
that
would
clear
out
any
doubt.
but
as
a
sweepstakes
is
operated
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
do
anything
with
the
manchester
bank
different
from
what
you
would
do
to
get
your
money
out
any
bank
where
its
been
deposited.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
the
--
that's
one
of
the
big
questions
in
this
case.
i
can
turn
to
that
briefly
now
and
then
in
more
detail
after
i
--
i
would
like
to
go
into
more
detail
after
having
sketched
out
the
legal
issue.
one
thing
can
be
said
clearly
about
the
acknowledgment
as
a
carbon
copy
of
the
sweepstakes
ticket.
it
serves
to
show
that
a
ticket
had
actually
been
purchased
in
the
name
and
address
of
the
person
whose
name
and
address
appears
on
this,
to
the
carbon
copy.
now
there
might
be
various
uses
that
can
be
made
of
such
a
document
that
serves
such
a
purpose.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
only
point
out
only
one
primarily
because
this
is
the
function
that
we
alleged
that
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief,
we
expect
to
prove
was
the
actual
function
of
it,
of
the
75
acknowledgements
used
in
this
case.
namely
to
facilitate
the
purchase
of
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
by
persons
who
did
not
actually
travel
to
new
hampshire,
did
not
actually
come
into
the
state
and
bought
their
tickets
there.
in
other
words
it
would
operate
and
we
expect
to
prove
that
it
did
operate
in
this
fashion.
someone
acting
as
a
broker,
in
this
case
the
defendant,
the
appellee
mr.
fabrizio
would
solicit
sales
of
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
in
other
states.
here,
it
was
in
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
would
take
orders
from
his
customers,
get
their
names
and
their
addresses.
then
after
having
compiled
a
sufficient
number
of
orders
travel
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
buy
tickets
in
their
names
and
addresses
by
writing
the
customers
name,
the
customers
address
on
each
of
these
tickets,
get
and
acknowledge
therefore.
now,
as
i've
said,
the
acknowledgement
verifies
officially
that
a
ticket
has
been
purchased
for
joe
jones,
401
5th
street
for
example.
with
this
acknowledgement,
the
broker
can
travel
back
to
new
york
or
whatever
state
it
is
and
verify
to
his
customers
that
he
has
in
fact
carried
out
the
--
their
orders.
has
in
fact
order
a
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
ticket
for
them.
this
is
one
function
and
this
is
the
only
function
i
think
relevant
here
because
this
is
what
we
--
if
we're
allowed
to
go
to
trial,
we
expect
to
prove
it
happened
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
don't
think
we
have
to
be,
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
exactly
our
contention
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice.
i'm
--
i
make
something
of
it
now
because
--
and
i
shall
at
the
close
of
my
argument
because
the
appellee
and
--
in
the
amicus
suggest
that
on
the
basis
of
this
indictment,
they
suggest
on
their
briefs
that
on
the
basis
of
this
indictment
we
could
not
prove
the
state
of
facts
that
i
described
for
you
that
we
expect
to
prove
at
the
trial.
(voice
overlap)
well
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
what?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
would
say
that
the
construction
of
the
acknowledgment
and
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
susceptible
of
being
used
or
which
in
any
particular
situation
it
has
been
used
is
essentially
a
question
of
fact
which
must
be
fit
within
the
framework
of
this
statute.
now,
i
think
that
that
--
i
don't
mean
to
propose
that
this
is
--
to
suggest
that
you
must
completely
throw
the
acknowledgement
to
one
side
when
you're
trying
to
determine
the
issue
here,
mainly
what
framework
must
this
be
read
again.
but
i
think
that
it
is
more
crucial
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
to
establish
the
statutory
framework
against
which
we
must
test
this
acknowledgement
and
its
function
rather
than
to
hypothecate
any
particular
state
of
facts
which
may
or
may
not
fit
within
that
stick
of
a
framework.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
because
there
are
five
elements
of
the
offense.
one
of
which
and
this
is
not
a
matter
of
any
dispute
at
all,
its
interstate
transportation
of
certain
objects.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
if
nothing
is
transported.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
right
mr.
justice
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
no
longer
is
contend
--
that
no
longer
is
questioned
here
either.
the
acknowledgement
at
--
this
was
put
an
issue
in
the
affidavit
filed
by
appellee's
former
counsel
in
the
lower
court
suggesting
that
the
acknowledgement
has
no
function
whatsoever
so
far
as
the
sweepstakes
is
concern
so
therefore
it's
not
wagering
paraphernalia.
but
that
--
that's
not
contended
here
anymore,
the
statute
covers
among
other
things,
records,
papers
and
writings.
and
i
think
its
common
ground
that
if
the
acknowledgement
is
nothing
else
it's
a
record,
paper
in
writing.
it's
the
other
--
it's
the
fifth
element
and
this
is
the
one
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
certainly.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
think
we
--
let
me
--
i
think
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
think
this
similar
example
would
also
illustrate
it
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
anybody
can
phrase
an
indictment
regardless
of
what's
fact
you
can
actually
prove
to
substantiate
the
indictment
that
can
pass
a
muster
under
any
statute.
if
i
--
if
there
was
an
indictment
alleging
that
i
with
evil
intent
assaulted
mr.
glazer,
i
suppose
that
indictment
would
stand
so
far
as
the
indictment
is
concern
and
it
would
state
a
charge
under
the
assault
statute.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
but
of
course
if
i
never
assault
mr.
glazer.
i
couldn't
be.
i
--
they
couldn't
prove
the
fact.
i
think
that
would
be
your
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
right,
i
--
we
do
not
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
how
we
do
analyze
what
the
statute
does
encompass
to
illustrate
why
it
is
that
we
do
not
construe
it
to
meet
that
situation.
that
is
to
say
that
even
though
the
indictment
in
the
abstract
would
be
a
perfectly
good
indictment
when
we
went
to
trial,
we
would
not
have
actually
proved
an
offense.
now
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
i
--
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all
and
if
--
i
think
i
can
make
this
clear
with
a
very
small
amount
of
elaboration.
there
are
as
we
conceive
of
it,
five
elements
in
the
offense
and
it
is
the
fifth
element
which
is
the
one
that
--
the
ones
that's
crucial.
let
me
first
put
aside
the
first
four
because
i
don't
think
there
are
any
dispute
about
those
and
i
don't
think
that
they
should
trouble
us
here.
first
of
course
is
the
statute
applies
to
any
person
except
the
common
carrier.
there
was
some
allegation
in
the
lower
court
that
it
only
applies
to
gangsters
and
professional
criminals
but
that's
no
longer
alleged.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
applies
to
anyone
who
does
certain
acts
unless
he's
a
common
carrier.
of
course
it
also
requires
interstate
transportation.
that's
not
disputed.
also
and
this
is
not
disputed
it
requires
scienter
that
you
must
--
the
person
involve
must
have
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
materials
he
is
transporting
and
intent
to
transport
it.
and
fourth,
it
only
covers
the
enumerated,
the
described
materials,
the
paraphernalia,
papers,
writings
etcetera.
and
fifth,
and
this
is
crucial.
it
only
covers
those
materials
knowingly
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
if
they
have
a
certain
function
that
is
proscribed
by
the
statute,
i
can
illustrate
this
in
two
ways,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
of
a
type
of
paper
that's
highly
flammable,
if
you
touch
a
cigarette
to
it
it'll
burn
out
quickly.
this
is
known
as
flash
paper.
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
flash
paper
is
very
useful
in
bookmaking
operations
because
bookmakers
can
keep
there
records
on
it
and
in
the
case
of
a
raid
all
they
have
to
do
is
touch
a
cigarette
to
it
and
the
records
are
destroyed,
the
evidence
is
destroyed.
now
if
a
person
is
alleged
to
have
carried
a
package
of
flash
paper
in
inter
--
knowingly
have
alleged
to
have
carried
a
package
of
flash
paper
in
interstate
commerce,
he
comes
within
the
first
four
elements
of
the
offense.
but
unless
it
is
also
alleged
that
that
flash
paper
had
a
function
which
is
proscribed
in
the
act,
for
example,
used
in
bookmaking,
a
violation
of
the
act
is
not
made
out.
you
can
carry
a
flash
paper
for
use
in
a
magic
show
for
example
or
some
other
theatrical
production.
for
the
same
thing
--
the
same
type
of
analysis
applies
to
these
acknowledgements
of
purchase.
if
i
carry
acknowledgements
of
purchase
across
the
state
line
for
use
in
building
a
bonfire
for
example
and
the
indictment
only
alleges
that's
the
use
i'm
making
of
it,
then
i
haven't
committed
an
offense
under
the
statute
and
the
indictment
doesn't
charge.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
exactly,
and
that's
the
essential
element.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
right.
and
it
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
but
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
indeed
the
contrary.
the
mere
fact
that
this
is
a
piece
of
paper
that
has
written
on
it
the
words
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
that
these
pieces
of
paper
with
those
words
written
on
it
are
carried
in
interstate
commerce
is
not
sufficient.
we
must
allege
as
we
do
and
we
must
prove
as
we
expect
to
that
this
piece
of
paper
or
this
75
pieces
of
papers
were
to
be
used
or
adapted
for
use
in
the
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
let
me
try
to
restate
the
position
i
am
--
i
am
taking
in
trial
to
make
it
abundantly
clear.
the
only
argument
for
the
propositions
that
an
individual
who
buys
his
own
ticket
at
the
sweepstakes
and
then
carries
the
receipt
back
to
the
district
of
columbia,
lets
say
does
not
violate
the
act.
the
only
--
the
reason
that
we
take
that
position
is
a
factual
one.
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
commission
has
and
this
is
--
there's
no
dispute
about
this,
has
attempted
to
build
into
its
sweepstakes
operations
certain
safeguards
so
that
its
purchasers
will
avoid
as
much
as
possible
conflict
with
the
laws
of
other
states,
conflicts
with
the
federal
--
with
the
federal
laws.
they
have
notified
--
they
notified
there
--
the
people
who
purchase
sweepstakes
tickets
and
get
these
acknowledgements
that
while
we
cannot
give
advice
on
the
laws
of
all
the
states,
if
there
is
any
doubt
in
your
mind
that
the
carriage
or
possession
of
this
acknowledgement
will
in
your
home
state
constitute
a
violation
of
that
law,
leave
it
here,
don't
carry
it.
in
other
words,
because
of
the
way
that
sweepstakes
commission
has
set
up
there
sweepstakes
i
think
it
--
i
think
that
in
a
case
of
the
individual
who
buys
this
ticket
and
goes
back
home
with
it,
when
that
case
goes
to
trial
i
think
the
government
would
have
an
extraordinarily
difficult
time
to
show
the
requisite
wagering
function
of
that
document.
now,
let
me
compare
another
type
of
operation,
a
private
numbers
--
private
numbers
game
--.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
it
is
our
condition
--
it
is
our
contention
that
it
must
have
some
wagering
function.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
now
that's
the
point
where
--
that's
the
point
where
we
disagree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
let
me
in
response
to
that
make
four
additional
statements
not
to
repeat
anything
that
i've
said
already.
in
the
first
place,
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
a
pleading
is
not
an
issue
in
this
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
the
construction
of
section
1953,
what
does
that
cover?
now
the
problem
that
you're
raising,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
contend
relates
to
in
one
respect
perhaps
is
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
as
a
pleading
but
i
think
even
more
directly
to
the
factual
question
of
what
is
the
function
of
new
hampshire's
acknowledgement
of
purchase?
now
it's
a
question
of
--
that's
a
question
of
fact.
when
i
responded
to
your
question
as
to
whether
the
individual
purchaser
would
be
liable
under
the
statute.
i
was
doing
that
on
an
--
on
my
own
assumption
as
to
what
the
fact
is.
how
--
what
this
piece
of
paper
in
the
abstract
mean
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
of
course
that's
not
an
issue
involved
here.
it's
not
what
the
--
what
in
fact
this
acknowledgement
is.
it's
whether
we
allege
in
our
indictment
all
of
the
necessary
elements
of
section
1953
as
your
honors
are
to
construe
it.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
and
again
in
reference
to
your
problem
mr.
justice
fortas
is
this.
any
time
you
have
a
criminal
statute
which
draws
a
sharp
line
as
it
should
between
what
is
illegal
on
the
one
hand
and
what
is
legal
on
the
other
hand
you're
bound
to
have
a
cluster
of
cases
at
the
borderline
that
might
post
difficult.
it
might
be
a
little
close
in
interpretation
one
way
or
the
other
indeed
might
even
raise
constitutional
questions.
but
it's
never
been
and
this
is
so
in
any
criminal
statute
that
sharply
defines
the
line
of
illegality.
but
it's
never
been
held
that
because
at
the
borderline
there
might
be
difficulties
and
there
might
be
problems
that
when
we're
dealing
with
a
case
that
is
quite
four
square
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
we
--
that
we
in
any
way
modify
the
position
that
we
would
take
in
that
case.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
to
wit
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
indeed,
to
wit:
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
and
that
brings
us
to
the
dispute
that
we
really
have
in
this
case,
whether
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
is
the
kind
of
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
contemplated
by
the
statute.
we
allege
that
it
had
a
function
in
that
sweepstakes.
in
our
view
this
is
a
sufficient
allegation
under
the
statute.
the
appellee
says
this
is
not
a
sufficient
because
in
their
understanding
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
as
encompassed
in
section
1953
means
an
illegal
wagering
pool,
illegal
under
the
laws
of
the
state
where
it
originates.
now
that's
where
we
really
have
a
dispute
here.
that's
the
legal
question
that
brings
us
to
this
court
mr.
justice.
we
contend
that
the
statute
applies
to
wit:
any
papers
that
have
a
use
in
any
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
regardless
of
whether
that
wagering
pool
is
legal
within
its
state
of
origin
or
not.
in
our
view,
the
legality
of
a
wagering
enterprise
within
its
home
state
is
not
material
to
the
definition
of
the
offense
in
1953
because
section
1953
only
comes
into
a
--
only
comes
into
operation
when
gambling
transcends
state
boundaries.
the
--
and
this
is
the
situation
that
happened
here.
we
have
a
crossing
of
state
boundaries.
now
i
think
we
can
look
to
the
--
all
of
the
typical
indicia
for
--
of
congressional
intent
and
congressional
meanig
and
find
that
any
wagering
pool
whether
its
legal
in
the
state
of
operation
or
illegal
in
the
state
of
operation,
its
contemplated
here.
let
me
say
at
the
outset
of
course
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
is
legal
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
but
it's
not
in
any
way
unique
in
this
respect.
there
are
more
than
75
countries
and
i
(inaudible)
that
this
statute
covers
interstate
as
well
as
foreign
commerce.
more
that
75
countries
have
legal
sweepstakes
or
lottery
operations
including
mexico,
our
very
near
neighbor
to
the
south.
in
addition
to
what
you
might
call
a
strictly
foreign
country,
the
american
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
has
for
many
years
had
its
--
has
a
legal
sweepstakes.
and
it
come
even
closer
to
home,
the
state
of
nevada
presently
and
certainly
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
licensed
bookmaking
and
sporting
pools.
and
both
of
this
operations,
bookmaking
and
sporting
pools
are
covered
by
section
1953.
so,
the
state
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
stand
out
any
unique
--
doesn't
put
itself
in
any
unique
position
because
gambling
is
legalized
there.
the
same
is
true
as
they
say
in
many
countries,
in
puerto
rico
and
nevada
and
of
course
conceivably
so
in
any
state
of
the
union.
the
statute
itself
of
course,
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
legal
wagering
pools
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
it
just
says
wagering
pools
with
respect
with
sporting
events.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
pardon
me?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
it's
a
--
subsequent.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
statute
was
enacted
in
1961.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
was
part
of
the
background
that
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
there
--
there's
an
explicit
legislative
history
on
the
question
that
i'm
directly
focusing
on.
we
cited
in
a
--
footnote
8,
page
11
and
8
of
our
briefs,
senator
kefauver
was
asking
a
question
about
the
statute
to
assist
an
attorney
general
miller.
that
time
he
was
the
head
of
the
criminal
division
and
he
was
the
department
spokesman
at
the
senate
hearing.
senator
kefauver
said
and
inquired
whether
this,
"bookmaking,
wagering
pool
and
so
forth
mean
where
it
is
not
legal
by
state
law."
mr.
miller's
response
to
this,
and
again
i
quote,
"unequivocal."
"no
sir."
that
provision
is
not
in
there.
it
was
the
position
of
the
department
that
these
types
of
paraphernalia,
records
and
other
devices
should
be
barred
from
interstate
commerce.
so,
there
was
--
the
question
that
is
at
issue
here
was
directly
put
at
least
one
time
during
the
hearings
on
the
bill
and
directly
answered
by
a
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
they're
all
part
of
it
and
there's
more
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
also.
the
--
before
i
turning
there,
let
me
focus
again
on
some
of
the
language
in
the
statute
which
of
course
is
the
first
stop
on
the
way
of
finding
out
what
congress
meant.
the
statute
doesn't
distinguish
between
illegal
wagering
pools
and
the
legal
wagering
pools
but
it
does
create
certain
exceptions
for
certain
types
of
wagering.
accepts
--
over
a
certain
types
of
wagering
and
certain
types
of
paraphernalia,
for
example
in
the
paraphernalia
category,
it
accepts
the
carriage
of
newspapers.
this
primarily
was
out
of
concern
for
freedom
of
the
press.
they
didn't
want
have
any
--
any
crimp
on
that
protected
right
at
all.
in
addition,
congress
carved
out
an
exception
for
legal
pari-mutuel
betting
material
and
this
is
the
one
that
i
think
is
of
some
special
relevance
here,
for
the
carrying
of
materials
to
be
used
in
the
placing
of
bets
on
a
sporting
event
into
a
state
where
such
betting
is
legal
by
statute.
now
when
congress
set
up
this
very
narrow
and
very
carefully
drawn
pattern
of
exceptions,
it
cannot
be
said
that
they
--
that
the
courts
are
free
to
imply
by
some
form
of
interpolation
a
further
exception
not
set
out
by
congress
for
the
carriage
of
wagering
materials
from
a
state
where
those
materials
are
legal.
in
fact
if
that
were
--
if
that
exception,
the
exception
for
carrying
materials
from
a
state
where
they're
legal
or
in
the
act
it
would
do
great
damage
if
not
completely
nullify
the
act
itself
because
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
no.
pari-mutuel
is
a
very
clearly
defined
termed.
it
involves
among
the
elements
in
the
pari-mutuel
betting
scheme
or
betting
act
a
race
track
or
at
the
place
where
the
sporting
event
takes
place.
and
the
betting
takes
place
very
shortly
before
the
particular
sporting
event,
usually
at
the
race,
the
horse
race,
or
dog
race.
the
betting
takes
place
almost
immediately
prior
to
the
event
on
which
the
price
turns
and
the
price
--
and
the
only
place
you
can
pay
--
the
only
place
you
can
collect
as
well
as
the
only
place
you
can
buy
ticket
is
at
the
race
track.
there's
really
very
little
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
the
same
is
true
in
nevada
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
nevada,
that's
been
the
case
in
nevada
for
many
years.
it
was
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
and
there
was
of
course
a
discussion
about
it
in
the
hearing.
nevada
legalizes
off
track
betting
and
there
is
an
exception
in
the
statute
for
the
carriage
of
material
relating
to
wagering
into
such
a
state.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
bring
in
papers
that
the
nevada
bookmakers
use
to
keep
their
records
on,
you
bring
it
into
nevada,
there
is
no
violation
of
statute.
but
to
extend
what
is
legal
in
nevada
to
the
other
states
would
violate
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
if
i'm
right.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
i
think
it
was
recognized
that
the
--
there
is
very
minimal
danger
of
trafficking
in
the
pari-mutuel
ticket.
that
pari-mutuel
betting
itself
--
well
first
of
all,
by
the
way,
the
exception
is
not
for
any
pari-mutuel
betting
but
only
for
legal
pari-mutuel
betting.
but
legal
pari-mutuel
betting
was
not
considered
by
the
senators
and
congressmen
who
addressed
themselves
to
this
issue
as
being
an
evil
where
the
states
sought
to
--
saw
fit
to
legalize
this
type
of
operation
which
is
quite
closely
confined
to
a
single
place,
a
race
track.
the
senators
and
congressmen
felt
there
was
a
no
need
for
the
federal
government
to
enter
into
this
area.
in
addition
of
course
that
its
well-known
and
it
was
mentioned
in
the
hearing
that
there
are
a
number
of
race
track
that
are
located
near
state
line
so
that
everyday
people
go
from
the
district
of
columbia
perhaps
to
laurel,
maryland
or
to
charles
town,
west
virginia
and
there's
a
lot
of
interstate
commerce
involved
here.
but
in
essence
all
we're
doing
is
--
all
that's
involved
is
a
simple
--
singly
located
pari-mutuel
operation
and
they
wanted
to
--
they
want
to
exempt
that.
quite
in
contrast
to
that
is
many
sweepstakes
and
certainly
the
new
hampshire
operation
where
there's
--
in
one
instance
an
11
month
period
of
buying
tickets
are
--
and
the
second
is
that
this
year,
a
six
month
period
of
buying
tickets
as
opposed
to
pari-mutuel
situation
where
you
buy
your
ticket
before
the
race.
the
race
is
run,
you
either
win
or
you
lose.
i
think
these
are
the
considerations
that
were
expressed
and
entered
the
minds
of
the
legislators
on
this
subject.
but
the
--
there
is
a
--
they
say
an
exemption
for
carrying
materials
into
a
place
such
as
nevada
or
indeed
into
new
hampshire
for
use
in
this
state
legalized
operations.
but
when
the
--
when
there's
a
possibility
of
opening
a
base
camp,
let
us
say
a
bookmaker,
opening
up
a
headquarters
in
nevada
but
all
legal
bookmaking
material
were
exempt
--
were
exempted
from
the
statute
whether
it
was
coming
into
nevada
or
going
out
from
nevada
this
would
be
a
boon
to
nevada
bookmakers
because
they
could
open
up
a
headquarters
there
and
operate
in
other
states
in
violation
of
those
state
laws
from
that
camp.
all
they
have
to
worry
of
course
are
the
laws
of
the
other
states
which
the
--
this
statute
among
other
things
was
designed
to
fortify,
to
assist
them.
its
not
at
all
surprising
i
might
--
i
should
note,
as
we
do
note
in
our
brief
that
congress
would
pass
a
statute
prohibiting
the
interstate
transportation
of
material
that
in
its
inception
at
least
is
related
to
a
legal
wagering
pool
or
a
legal
sporting
operation.
because
for
over
90
years
congress
has
had
a
statute
which
has
prohibited
the
mailing
of
material
that
is
connected
to
legal
lotteries
or
legal
wagering
pools.
now
this
statute
has
been
--
had
been
very
narrowly
construed,
this
is
now
in
the
u.s.
code
in
section
1301
through
1305.
the
statute
is
not
nearly
as
broad
as
1953.
it
doesn't
cover
all
the
paraphernalia
and
materials
that
related
primarily
to
lottery
tickets
or
things
that
could
be
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
represent
a
lottery
ticket.
congress
was
disturbed
and
discussed
at
great
length
the
limitations
that
had
been
placed
on
the
prior
statute.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
1953
was
to
plug
the
loop
holes
that
had
been
opened
up
the
earlier
legislation.
but
for
our
purposes
here
it's
only
relevant
to
know
that
the
earlier
and
this
is
not
at
all
contested.
it's
recognized
in
the
briefs
of
the
other
side.
here
the
statutes
did
apply
to
the
mailing
of
for
example
irish
sweepstakes
ticket.
irish
sweepstakes
are
perfectly
legal
in
ireland.
but
when
they're
to
be
mailed
out
of
that
country
here,
they
violate
--
they
had
for
many
years
violated
section
1301.
and
now
the
same
thing,
if
interstate
transportation
is
involved
would
violate
section
1953.
the
course
the
same
is
true,
we
contend
with
respect
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
there's
no
real
difference
for
these
purposes.
one
point
is
dwelled
upon
at
great
length
in
appellee's
briefs
and
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
that
is
the
discussion
in
the
legislative
hearings
and
the
senate
on
how
--
about
organized
crime.
well
it
is
true
that
organized
crime
was
considered
a
very
serious
problem
by
the
legislators
who
enacted
this
statute
and
certainly
that
one
of
the
aims
of
the
statute
was
to
put
a
crimp
into
the
operations
of
organized
criminal
syndicates.
but
the
statute
went
and
plainly
so
went
farther
than
that
very,
very
limited
purpose.
it
clearly
was
intended
to
apply
as
was
recognized
in
the
hearings
to
an
individual
bookmaker
or
individual
operator
of
the
lottery.
it
was
not
connected
with
any
syndicate.
the
point
was
to
close
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
to
gambling
operations
which
otherwise
would
transcends
state
lines.
subsidiary
purpose
was
to
assist
the
states
of
the
union
and
by
far
the
majority
of
the
states
and
the
union
prohibit
off
track
betting.
all
of
them
prohibit
strictly
a
numbers
game
and
most
of
them
prohibit
lottery
operations.
the
idea
was
to
assist
this
states
in
the
enforcement
of
there
statutes
as
something
that
would
be
defeated
if
as
an
example
i
gave
before
i
--
bookmaker
in
nevada
were
allowed
freely
to
operate
throughout
the
country
from
that
home
base.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no
constitutional
argument
has
been
made
at
any
time
in
this
case.
no
question
was
raised
at
all.i
think
on
this
last
point
i
--
the
state
of
new
hampshire
itself
i
believe
has
recognized
the
problem
of
the
conflict
that
could
occur
when
one
state
legalizes
a
form
or
all
forms
indeed
of
gambling.
and
the
other
states
in
the
union
maintain
there
prohibitions
against
gambling.
shortly
after
the
sweepstakes
was
initiated
i
think
in
1964
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
commission
sent
out
a
memorandum
to
prosecuting
and
law
enforcement
officers
in
all
the
states
describing
the
sweepstakes
operations
and
explaining
the
safeguards
that
were
attempted
to
be
build
into
the
operations
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
state
law.
but
they
did
point
out
and
properly
so
and
i
read
briefly
from
the
memorandum.
when
one
state
permits
the
sale
of
sweepstakes
or
lottery
tickets
and
others
prohibits
such
sale
the
primary
danger
is
that
tickets
purchased
lawfully
in
new
hampshire
would
be
resold
unlawfully
elsewhere.
and
this
danger
that
new
hampshire
recognized
is
precisely
one
of
the
dangers
which
the
members
of
congress
recognized
when
they
passed
1953.
now,
in
closing
i
would
like
to
return
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
you
read
my
mind
mr.
justice,
this
was
--
this
exactly
was
the
point
out
i
was
about
to
make.
that
is
correct.
this
statute
i
should
point
out
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
appellee
made
his
trip
from
new
york
to
new
hampshire
and
back.
it
was
enacted
after
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
filed.
but
at
the
present
time
there
is
a
statute
in
new
hampshire
which
prohibits
the
business
of
selling
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
in
any
manner
except
by
the
way
that
the
sweepstakes
commission
sets
it
up
itself.
in
other
words,
someone
who
is
not
an
agent
of
the
state
is
prohibited
from
going
into
the
business
of
selling
these
tickets.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
acknowledgement
is
non-saleable
and
non-transferable.
but
of
course
a
person
can
sell
a
ticket,
indeed
a
person
who
sells
any
item
under
certain
circumstances
without
there
being
a
physical
transfer.
so,
it
is
possible
for
me
to
travel
from
new
hampshire
back
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
to
offer
to
sell
to
someone
here
and
to
actually
make
a
sale
to
someone
here
of
a
sweepstakes
ticket
even
though
the
ticket
itself
remains
in
new
hampshire.
what
i
have
accomplished
is
the
same
thing.
i
have
enabled
that
person
to
place
a
bet
on
the
sweepstakes.
and
the
--
at
the
same
time
i
have
earned
a
commission
for
myself
or
for
those
services.
what
i
have
to
prove
to
him
and
satisfy
him
that
i
have
actually
carried
out
his
order,
that
i've
actually
placed
a
bet
that
he
requested
i
placed.
i
have
an
acknowledgement
of
purchase
which
verifies
that
his
name
and
his
address
are
inscribed
on
a
ticket
in
the
possession
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
i
would
--
i
will
answer
your
question
directly
but
i
think
to
avoid
misleading
i
must
make
one
preparatory
statement.
the
situation
that
you
described
as
some
of
the
others
you've
mentioned
do
go
to
a
border
line
situation
under
the
statute.
we
construe
the
statute
to
apply
to
the
knowing
carriage
of
papers,
paraphernalia
etcetera
in
interstate
commerce
where
those
papers
and
paraphernalia
have
a
wagering
function.
now
i
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
situation
you've
describe
would
be
a
case
where
there
is
a
wagering
function
in
that
paper.
it
does
facilitate
the
other
state
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh
no,
it
must
be
a
function
in
either
bookmaking
or
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
a
numbers
game
or
waging
pool.
in
this
case
it
must
be
a
function
of
a
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
as
we
allege.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
statute
applies
where
the
papers
have
a
wagering
function.
now
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
state
of
--
in
fact
i
note
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
that
appellee
from
what
they
said
in
their
briefs
would
disagree
with
you
on
the
fact
of
whether
this
particular
paper
has
a
wagering
function.
well,
i
understand
and
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
that
factual
issue
is
a
matter
that
must
be
resolved
here,
for
the
position
of
this
case.
i
would
point
out
one
other
point
in
relation
to
the
questions
you've
ask.
now
i
realize
again
this
is
not
directly
relate
to
the
problem
in
this
court,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
this
statute
was
drawn
broadly
and
decidedly
so
to
eliminate
as
much
as
possible
loop
holes
which
had
appeared
in
the
earlier
statute
as
a
result
of
its
breath
this
was
recognized
as
was
mentioned
expressly
by
attorney
general
kennedy
in
his
opening
testimony
in
the
senate
and
it
was
also
discussed
in
a
memorandum
which
the
department
of
justice
sent
to
u.s.
attorneys
across
the
country
after
the
statute
was
passed
and
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
as
a
result
of
this
breath,
it
was
recognized
that
there
would
be
cases
of
the
sort
you
described
not
only
in
relation
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
but
in
relation
to
clearly
illegal
activity.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
that's
right.
not
only
in
relation
to
sweepstakes,
legal
sweepstakes
such
as
puerto
--
perhaps
more
appropriate
puerto
rico,
irish
sweepstakes,
the
other
legal
sweepstakes
that
were
existent
in
the
similar
to
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh
no.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
--
i'll
try
keep
a
straight
face
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
think
that
they
--
the
congress
viewed
--
would
have
viewed
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
the
same
light
as
it
viewed
legal
bookmaking
in
nevada
and
the
legal
sweepstakes
indeed
the
irish
sweepstakes
as
mentioned
half
dozen
times
in
the
hearing.
illegal
sweepstakes
operating
in
various
foreign
countries
that
is
to
say
would
have
viewed
them
as
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
and
where
this
operations
legal
in
the
area
where
they
were
--
where
they
originated.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
--
well,
the
same
is
true
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
same
is
true
to
the
other
--
to
the
mexican
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
it's
unique
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
it's
not
unique
now,
its
not
--
it's
not
unique
and
its
not
--
it's
certainly
not
unique
in
our
history.
many
states
have
operated
lotteries.
i
think
the
list
at
one
time
was
up
to
a
dozen
at
various
time.
now
it
is
unique
in
the
1960's
but
there
have
been
state
lottery.
i
think
what
congress
has
clearly
had
in
mind
was
that
when
you're
talking
about
operations
which
transcends
state
borders
and
when
you
have
as
we
do
have
in
this
country
the
overwhelming
majority
of
state
prohibiting
lotteries,
bookmaking,
this
other
forms
of
wagering
covered
by
1953
that
whatever
you
can
say
about
the
policy
of
the
state
which
legalizes
or
indeed
sponsors
and
operates
a
certain
form
of
wagering,
you
still
--
as
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concern
cannot
close
out
the
dangers
that
there
will
be
an
impingement
upon
the
policies
of
the
other
states
when
interstate
commerce
is
involved.
i
would
have
--
i
have
no
hesitation
in
answering
your
question
whether
congress
would
have
enacted
the
statute
the
same
way
in
relation
to
the
new
hampshire's
sweepstakes
had
it
been
in
operation
with
the
(inaudible).
indeed
there
have
been
several
bills
introduced
in
recent
years
to
carve
out
an
exemption
for
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
in
relation
to
the
mailing
statute,
the
mailing
of
lottery
materials.
these
have
not
passed.
one
statute
has
passed
exempting
the
new
hampshire's
sweepstakes
from
the
wagering
tax
operation
but
there
is
a
proviso
in
that
which
says
that
this
only
goes
to
officials
and
agents
of
the
state
that's
operating
the
sweepstakes
itself.
they
--
congress
obviously
recognized
that
even
where
a
state
legalizes
and
sponsors
a
sweepstakes
there
maybe
outsiders
who
could
take
advantage
of
that
operation
for
their
own
private
purpose.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
that
--
that's
what
we
contend
happened
here.
that
there
is
--
although
new
hampshire
does
protect
itself
to
the
large
extent
there
is
this
one
area
where
sales
can
be
consummated
outside
of
the
state
through
private
agents.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
would
doubt
that
the
gentleman
from
new
hampshire
and
of
course
he
can
speak
to
that
better
than
i
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
function
and
there
is
not
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
it
said
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
presented
to
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh,
well
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
once
your
name
is
on
the
ticket
but
there
is
the
question
of
how
do
you
decide
--
how
do
determine
whose
name
goes
on
those
tickets
and
whose
name
don't
go
on
the
ticket.
well,
there
--
the
state
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
control
that.
the
person
who
comes
to
the
machine
writes
the
name
and
address
on
the
ticket.
now
if
before
coming
to
that
machine
he
has
made
arrangements
in
other
states
for
a
fee
or
for
a
commission
to
travel
to
new
hampshire
and
to
purchase
tickets
for
these
absentee
purchasers
he
may
very
well
be
violating
the
laws
of
other
states.
indeed
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs
we
be
violating
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
we
contend
that
this
is
a
violation
as
we
alleged
here
of
section
1953.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
of
course
well
when
it
--
yes
that's
right,
when
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
it's
--
among
the
elements
in
the
offense
is
the
interstate
transportation
of
these
materials
for
a
proscribed
purpose
and
it's
the
arrangements
relate
to
the
proscribed
purpose
for
which
these
things,
these
objects
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
what
we
allege,
oh
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
the
proscribed
purpose
was
used
in
the
sweepstakes,
was
to
facilitate
wagering
in
the
sweepstakes
and
indeed
it
was
--
it
is
the
arrangements
that
he
made
with
new
york.
it
was
the
customers
in
new
york
that
indicate
that
what
he
was
doing
was
facilitating,
wagering
by
these
persons
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
without
having
them
--
without
requiring
them
to
come
into
the
state.
the
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
well,
the
function
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
we
don't
have
figures
on
how
many
are
bought
but
we
know
how
many
winners
there
are.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
there
17%
of
the
winners
are
in
staters
and
83
are
out
of
state.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
somehow
they
get
--
they
could
travel
to
new
hampshire
and
get
them
of
course
so
they
could
get
them
to
some
other
agencies.
and
we
don't
have
any
figures
on
how
many
get
them
one
way,
how
many
get
them
the
other
way.
but
we
do
strongly
urge
and
in
conclusion
that
an
indictment
which
does
charge
that
an
individual
carries
certain
papers
to
wit
acknowledgements
of
purpose
which
are
alleged
to
be
used
and
devised
and
adapted
and
designed
for
used
in
a
wagering
pool
to
wit
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
does
state
an
offense
under
section
1953.
and
because
of
this
we
would
strongly
urge
that
the
case
be
reversed,
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
we
can
go
to
trial
and
prove
the
allegations
that
we've
made.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
would
do
the
best
i
can.
there's
been
some
confusion
here
to
which
i
have
contributed
to
largely.
between
facts
that
can
be
proven
and
what
the
statute
requires
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
indeed
i
think
we
all
have
used
the
same
phrase
that
an
indictment
charges
an
offense
under
section
1953.
if
it
alleges
that
a
person
knowingly
carries
in
interstate
commerce
certain
paraphernalia
to
be
used
in
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
now,
it
is
our
view
and
this
was
what
i
attempted
to
state
and
answer
to
your
early
question
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact
whether
any
particular
piece
of
paper
or
any
particular
piece
of
paraphernalia
is
to
be
used
in
a
wagering
pool
and
there
may
be
some
dispute
as
there
has
been
this
morning
as
to
whether
just
on
its
face
this
acknowledgement
necessarily
has
a
use
in
the
wagering
pool
or
whether
more
facts
must
be
develop
to
prove
that
use.
now,
i
--
when
i
answered
mr.
justice
fortas'
earlier
question
by
saying
the
tourist
who
goes
in
would
not
violate
the
statute,
i
was
doing
it
on
the
assumption
that
as
to
him
we
could
not
prove
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
has
a
use.
i
may
be
wrong
in
that
assumption
but
i
don't
think
that
that's?
i
don't
think
that's
a
material
here.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no
to
either
one
or
to
two.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
but
two
qualifications
should
be
put
forth.
one,
of
course
they're
still
at
the
question
--
they're
still
at
this
essential
factual
question
whether
this
acknowledgement
was
used
in
that
particular
--
did
have
a
use
in
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes,
that's
the
question
of
fact.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
right,
but
the
answer
is,
the
answer
is
yes
that
an
indictment
drafted
in
those
terms
could
be
brought
against
that
individual.
i
would
--
then
there's
--
i
still
think
and
i'm
--
and
there's
some
log
ahead
as
to
whether
we
can
prove
our
case.
but
there's
another
point
that
is
made
in
the
brief
that
is
quite
relevant
here.
and
that
is
the
--
although
--
naturally
it
doesn't
go
directly
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
department
of
justice
has
been
on
the
record
since
the
--
not
only
after
the
in
--
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute
but
in
the
legislative
hearings
on
the
statute
that
although
the
statute
would
be
broad
enough
to
cover
that
situation
or
the
person
who
carries
the
numbers
ticket
that
those
persons
would
not
be
prosecuted
as
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
question
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
as
far
as
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
concerned
as
i
indicated
i
believe
that's
correct.i
think
the
point
should
be
made.
i
think
that
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
--
this
is
of
course
the
fact
but
also
as
i
try
to
indicate
for
the
fact
that
border
line
cases
may
arise
under
this
quite
broad
statute.
in
a
way,
takes
away
from
the
meaning
but
then
i
would
like
to
read
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
reason
is
they
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
don't
think
that
--
with
two
differences,
justice
fortas.
i
don't
believe
that
analysis
is
applicable
here.
the
indictment
was
written
the
way
it
is
written
because
the
statute
is
written
the
way
it
is
written.
the
only
wagering
pool
that
we
have
involved
here
and
we
will
say
that
we
have
no
proof
that
mr.
fabrizio
himself
was
setting
up
a
different
pool,
the
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
involved
in
this
case
on
its
fact
with
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
and
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendant,
mr.
fabrizio,
is
carrying
paraphernalia
to
be
used
in
that
pool.
this
meets
the
--
these
meets
the
terms
of
the
statute
completely
and
the
reason
that
nothing
more
was
said
was
the
government's
view
that
nothing
more
need
be
said.
seems
to
be
contended,
well
it
is
indeed
contended
by
appellee
that
one
thing
more
has
to
be
said.
we
have
to
say
illegal
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
or
some
other
wagering
pool
than
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
this
issue
which
the
central
legal
issue
presented
in
this
case
has
been
debated
and
i
think
we
have
indicated
that
this
--
the
congress
intended
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event
to
mean
any
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event,
the
irish
sweepstakes
was
mentioned
expressly
in
the
statute
as
being
an
example
of
a
wagering
pool
with
respect
to
a
sporting
event.
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
so
far
as
the
way
the
connection
with
sporting
event
is
concern
is
the
same.
may
i
make
two
statements
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
sir.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
i
can
say
this
is
in
terms
of
what
was
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
they
enacted
the
statute.
it
was
a
proliferation
of
gambling
operations
beyond
the
borders
of
a
single
state
into
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
that
disturbed
them.
i
think
that
if
the
history
of
our
society
was
that
nobody
was
interested
in
buying
tickets
in
other
states,
the
sweepstakes
congress
may
have
not
been
concerned
that
there
was
a
problem
and
may
not
have
passed
the
statute.
if
i
think
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
understand.
i
--
well,
i
think
what
you
suggest
--
what
your
question
suggest
to
me
is
that
--
is
that
realistically
and
this
is
something
that
congress
had
in
mind.
you
can't
think
about
the
situation
where
other
--
the
de
minimus
situation
where
there's
only
going
to
be
one
potential
violator
involved.
there
are
numerous
potential
violators.
indeed
the
83%
of
the
winners
from
out
of
state
who
have
gained
profit
on
the
sweepstakes
conceivably
may
have
been
involved
in
violations
themselves,
a
certain
part
of
it.
so
it's
not
just
--
just
the
case
of
one
man
with
one
ticket.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
know
of
none
--
person
but
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
that's
--
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
equipped
to
satisfy
you
on
that
particular
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
think
it
--
it
is
clear,
it
was
made
clear
in
the
hearings
on
this
case
that
the
government
is
interested
in
that.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
in
the
lotteries
of
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
as
i
say
i'
m
not
prepared
to
say
that
--
and
nothing
happened.
i'm
not
--
i
have
no
knowledge
bearing
on
your
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
oh!
oh,
indeed,
indeed,
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
mr.
chief
justice
i
don't
mean
and
i
hope
i'm
not
leaving
the
impression
that
that
there
is
no
interest
in
that
of
the
government
i
just
--
and
i
just
do
not
have
at
hand
the
information
to
direct
to
that
question.
i
think
it
is
--
so
far
as
the
direct
question
involved
here,
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
and
there
was
--
i'm
convinced
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
members
of
congress,
the
statute
was
designed
to
cover
irish
sweepstakes,
other
foreign
country
sweepstakes,
other
legal
sweepstakes
for
example
puerto
rico
just
as
well
as
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i'll
do
my
very
best
to
provide
that
information
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
and
--
yes,
i
would,
yes
we
shall
provide
that
information.
i
would
submit
of
course
that
the
absence
of
prosecutions
of
any
number
of
violators
of
the
statute
doesn't
read
on
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
let
me
--
may
i
--
may
i
in
conclusion
make
the
three
points
well
i
believe
at
least
in
my
understanding
of
the
operation
--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well,
yes,
i
under
--
directing
to
the
statements
that
mr.
millimet
made
which
i
--
as
i
understand
them
are
in
--
are
inaccurate.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
one,
that
you
can
only
--
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
more
than
10
new
hampshire
sweepstakes
tickets
is
to
go
the
commission
and
buy
a
bulk
order.
i
understand
that
that's
not
the
case
that
the
machines
are
only
activated
for
10
tickets
sales
at
a
time.
but
if
a
person
for
example
wanted
to
buy
20
tickets
at
a
liquor
store,
he
could
do
that
by
paying
a
clerk
$30,
writing
out
10
tickets,
returning
to
the
clerk
and
paying
30
more
dollars
and
writing
out
20
more
tickets
that
you
don't
have
to
buy
--
that
if
you
--
you
can
buy
more
than
10
other
than
by
going
in
and
registering
with
the
commission.
mr.
millimet
also
suggests
that
if
what
new
hampshire
had
was
a
lottery
rather
than
a
sweepstakes
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
act.
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
covered
by
the
second,
the
lower
down
section
of
the
act
which
applies
to
numbers,
policy
and
similar
games
that
a
lottery
is
similar
to
a
numbers
game
and
if
the
drawing
based
on
the
face
--
on
the
number.
thank
you
very
much.
