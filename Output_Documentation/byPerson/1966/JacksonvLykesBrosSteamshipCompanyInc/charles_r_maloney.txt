mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
have
20
minutes
on
direct
and
10
on
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
can
i
begin
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes.
this
is
a
death
case.
this
is
a
death
case
involving
a
longshoreman
employed
by
lykes
brothers
steamship
company
inc.
lykes
brothers
is
a
steamship
operator
that
acted
as
a
stevedore,
acted
as
a
ship
owner
and
acted
as
a
ship
operator,
the
primary
purpose
instead
of
a
ship
operator
and
a
ship
owner.
stevedoring
is
only
secondary
ancillary
to
their
operation
of
the
ships.
they
have
approximately
45
ships
that
they
operate.
luther
jackson
was
a
longshoreman;
he
was
employed
to
board
one
of
the
vessels
owned
and
operated
by
lykes.
he
was
employed
direct
by
lykes.
in
the
course
of
this
employment,
he
was
caused
to
inhale
fumes
from
insecticide
which
ultimately
cause
or
contributed
to
his
death.
no
proceedings
were
had
in
this
case
before
the
u.s.
deputy
commissioner.
there's
no
award
here,
there
is
no
compensation
payments,
there
is
no
voluntary
or
involuntary
payments
of
compensation
under
the
deputy
commissioner
proceedings.
there
have
been
no
proceedings
before
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
first
proceeding
was
in
the
civil
district
court
for
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
civil
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
this
is
a
state
court.
this
is
a
state
court
forum.
suit
was
filed
in
a
state
court
forum
on
the
four
basic
counts.
number
one,
under
the
jones
act;
number
two,
under
the
general
maritime
law
has
supplemented
by
our

death
statute
2315;
and
number
three,
on
the

tort;
number
four,
in
louisiana
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir.
they
denied
us
a
claim
under
the
jones
act.
they
denied
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
they
--
this
have
might
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir.
in
robinson
versus
lykes
there
was
no
death
and
this
judgment
of
jackson
versus
lykes
is
based
on
robinson
versus
lykes.
in
robinson
versus
lykes,
rufus
robinson
was
a
live
longshoreman,
but
they
denied
the
right
of
action
and
the
cause
of
action
in
general
maritime
law
under
rufus
robinson
versus
lykes
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
905,
section
905
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers
act
excluded
such
right.
and
they
were
to
based
it
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir,
under
rufus
robinson
that
would
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
crew,
they
said
he
would
have
had
a
jones
act
but
we
contend
that
there
was
a
question
of
fact
in
the
salute
to
judge
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
if
it
would
have
been
a
non-lykes
employee,
i
would
imagine
that
the
state
court
would
have
granted
him
a
right
in
cause
of
action
on
the
general
maritime
law.
since
we
file
so
few
of
these
suits
over
in
state
court,
i
really
can't
tell
you
--
tell
you
exactly
what
it
would
be
if
it
were
put
to
issue.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
in
federal
court,
we
file
this
type
all
the
time.
we
have
no
problem
like
this
in
federal
court.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
have
a
problem
with
ordinary
negligence
when
the
employer
is
a
direct
employer,
because
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
in
this
case
this
comes
within
the
scope
of
yaka
versus
reed
or
reed
versus
yaka,
so
we
have
a
problem
with
reference
to
negligence.
and
we
don't
know
exactly
whether
or
not
we
can
have
a
cause
of
action
if
the
mate
or
the
master,
or
one
of
the
regular
bosons
or
abs
or
members
of
the
crew
had
caused
or
created
an
unsafe
condition.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
don't
know
where
we
stand
on
that.
we
assume
that
the
courts
will
make
a
dichotomy
between
the
negligence
of
a
regular
member
of
the
crew
and
give
us
a
cause
of
action.
they
generally
throw
us
out
on
the
basis
that
a
fellow
longshoreman
has
created
the
unseaworthy
condition
or
that
he
has
caused
the
negligent
act
that
injured
him.
but
i
think
that
what
we
have
right
here
is
that
we've
been
denied
before
we
even
presented
any
facts.
we've
been
denied
on
a
summary
judgment.
we've
been
thrown
out
right
at
the
very
beginning
stating
that
we
have
no
right
of
action,
no
cause
of
action
for
a
claim
under
the
jones
act,
for
a
claim
under
general
maritime
law.
i'm
not
going
to
bring
up
louisiana
tort
law
because
that's
not
the
basis
for
this
appeal
or
i
won't
bring
up
louisiana
workmen's
comp,
that's
not
basis
of
this
appeal.
i
would
just
confine
myself
to
the
jones
act
and
to
general
maritime
law.
before
--
judge
carey
in
the
civil
district
court,
it
was
urged
that
whether
or
not
luther
jackson
was
a
member
of
the
crew,
is
a
question
of
fact.
it's
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide,
that
he
had
no
authority
to
make
that
decision
which
based
on
the
various
cases
that
you
don't
take
the
mere
name
that
this
is
a
longshoremen
act,
he
is
a
longshoreman
than
he's
automatically
as
matter
of
law
within
the
scope
of
the
longshoreman
act
just
like
a
railroad
employee,
if
he
was
a
brakeman,
he
isn't
automatically
within
the
scope
of
fela.
he
may
come
under
the
longshoremen
act
if
he's
over
navigable
waters
and
he
may
be
a
member
of
the
crew
if
he
has
aboard
a
vessel.
i
contented
before
judge
carey
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide.
and
he
felt
that
was
a
matter
of
absolute
law
that
he
couldn't
be
a
member
of
the
crew,
that
he
had
to
be
a
longshoreman
within
the
scope
of
the
longshoremen's
harbor
workers'
act.
my
second
argument
to
judge
carey
was
that
conceding
--
that
you
assumed
he's
a
member
--
that
he
cannot
be
a
member
of
the
crew.
then,
i
have
a
general
maritime
law
claim
for
my
client.
and
he
has
a
claim
based
on
the
warrant
of
seaworthi
--
seaworthiness
pursuant
to
reed
versus
yaka.
his
position
was
that
section
905
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
worker
act
precluded
any
claim
whatsoever
against
lykes
brothers
on
the
general
maritime
law.
his
position
was
that
this
was
the
same
problem
that
he
had
handled
in
ellis
versus
travelers
and
in
stepter
versus
t.
smith.
if
you
go
back
to
the
robinson
case,
you'll
find
that
there
is
a
quote
of
at
least
one
of
those
cases
in
the
robinson
versus
lykes
case.
and
he
based
his
decision
on
the
robinson
versus
lykes
decision
that
the
only
remedy
that
the
weather
had
was
pursuant
to
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act.
my
position
to
the
judge
was,
that
he
was
making
in
the
determination
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
that
this
particular
employee
was
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
that
he
was
making
the
determination
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
couldn't
be
a
seaman.
he
was
making
the
determination
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he
had
to
be
a
longshoreman
and
even
though
he
was
making
this
determination,
he
was
excluding
the
ruling
or
the
holding
at
least
to
the
spirit
of
reed
versus
yaka.
well,
i
lost
in
the
lower
court.
so
we
went
up
to
court
of
appeals.
all
these
same
points
were
urged
and
that
under
the
jones
act,
it
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine
that
it
would
not
be
as
a
matter
of
law
he
was
a
longshoreman.
it
had
--
it
was
a
question
of
fact
that
had
to
be
determined
by
the
deputy
commissioner,
since
the
deputy
commissioner
had
made
no
determination
it
was
moot.
and
in
this
case
before
the
court
of
appeals,
their
opinion
was
there
are
all
questions
which
included
the
louisiana
tort
and
louisiana
workmen's
comp.
all
the
questions
resolved
themselves
to
one
point,
33
u.s.c.
905
the
exclusive
remedy
clause.
and
their
position
was
that
the
exclusive
remedy
clause
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
excluded
this
man
from
being
a
member
of
the
crew,
excluded
this
man
from
having
any
rights
under
general
maritime
law
or
his
widow
and
precluded
any
claim
under
louisiana
tort
or
workmen's
comp.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
a
writ
was
applied
for.
the
writ
was
denied,
two
justices
dissented.
the
two
justices
were
saunders
and
samuel.
and
they
were
the
same
ones
who
dissented
in
robinson
versus
lykes
and
for
basically
the
same
reason
that
they
dissented
in
robertson
versus
lykes.
and
now
i'm
before
this
court
urging
the
same
thing,
i'm
urging
that
mrs.
jackson
has
a
right
to
bring
this
case
before
the
jury,
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
her
husband
was
a
member
of
the
crew.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
agree
that
she
--
that
her
husband
was
a
member
the
crew,
i'm
just
asking
for
the
right
to
bring
this
to
the
jury
to
let
them
make
the
determination.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
go
for
under
jones
act
and
general
maritime
law.
general
maritime
law
supplemented
by
2315.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
had
a
very
brief
minor
--
fewer
discussion
on
tungus,
goette,
hess
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
and
all
of
these
landmark
cases.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
very
little
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
our
state
--
that
statute
is
a
very
broad
death
statute.
i
quoted
it
in
my
brief.
and
it
would
be
my
position
that
this
death
statute
gives
more
than
general
maritime
law
would
give
because
we
have
a
civil
law
here,
and
we
have
other
statute
besides
2315.
we
have
667,
we
have
617,
we
have
2322,
2317.
we
have
a
number
of
state
statutes.
all
of
these
statutes
or
survive
under
2315.
we
even
have
some
admiralty
statutes.
this
wasn't
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
my
position
would
be
that
the
state
law
is
only
a
vehicle
--
is
only
a
vehicle
to
give
him
a
right
on
the
gen
--
give
the
widow
a
right
under
general
maritime
law.
my
view
would
be
the
--
my
minority
view
in
tungus.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well,
i
don't
say
overruling,
because
i
also
feel
that
the
2315
statute
of
state
of
louisiana
is
broad
enough
to
include
general
maritime
law.
this
comes
from
a
french
napoleonic
code.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
have
a
case
right
now.
that's
in
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
putnam
was
an
ex-state
court
judge,
was
in
the
western
district
for
the
state
of
louisiana
decided
the
grigsby
case.
and
he
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
this
case
is
now
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we're
hoping
that
the
fifth
circuit
will
affirm
his
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes.
he's
decided
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
he
has
decided
in
favor
of
the
widow
and
the
defendants.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
he
really
never
considered
this
here
a
problem
of
tungus.
he
was
only
concerned
with
that
we
had
no
right
of
action
or
cause
of
action
because
of
stepter
and
ellis.
ellis
and
stepter
were
a
conflict
between
state
compensation
and
federal
compensation.
and
that
went
back
to
the
richard's
decision.
in
the
richard's
decision,
they
would
allow
you
to
go
into
federal
court.
and
seek
that
workman's
compensation
in
the
federal
court
$70.00
a
week.
then
you
could
sue
into
the
state
act
for
a
lump-sum
settlement
which
was
not
provided
for
in
the
state
court
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
judge
putnam.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
that's
my
first
--
my
first
claim
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
but
if
i'm
wrong
under
the
jones
act
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
then
i
have
to
make
my
claim
under
general
maritime
law
and
then
i
have
to
resort
to
2315.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
he
was
doing
longshoreman
work
which
work
was
traditionally
that
of
the
seaman.
but
he
was
working
--
he
was
working
for
a
ship
operator
who
was
primarily
a
ship
operator
was
primarily
involved
in
ship
operation.
and
whose
stevedoring
was
only
secondary.
and
we
would
try
to
urge
to
the
jury
that
this
man
could
meet
the
test
of
being
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir
because
if
he
was
--
it
was
a
t.
smith
&
sons
situation,
t.
smith
is
a
stevedore.
mainly
there
is
a
stevedoring
operation.
well,
he
has
to
make
his
claim
under
the
jones
act
against
his
employer.
he
can't
make
it
against
the
ship
owner.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
he
must
make
it
against
his
employer.
t.
smith
&
son
does
not
operate
ships.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
want
to
first
urge
what
any
ordinary
bonafide
member
of
the
crew
would
urge
that
he
has
a
claim
under
the
jones
act
against
his
employer
who
is
a
ship
operator.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
alright,
i
lose
that.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
alright.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well,
the
longshoreman
--
the
longshoreman
have
a
traditional
third
party
claim
against
the
vessel.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
against
the
ship
operator.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
against
the
ship
and
in
pursuant
to
reed
versus
yaka
whoever
owns
the
ship.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
the
jones
act
claim
is
the
easiest.
the
maritime
claim
presents
problems.
maritime
claim
presents
problems
of
negligence
and
who
was
negligent
if
the
wrong
posed
negligence
you
wouldn't
have
any
claim.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
that's
a
little
problem
in
louisiana.
we
have
a
statute
for
comparative
negligence,
but
it's
been
ignored.
it's
completely
ignored
and
they
followed
the
common
law
rules.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well,
this
should
be
maritime
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
you're
right.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
if
tungus
were
overruled
then
this
would
be
comparative.
if
tungus
wasn't
overruled
then
this
would
be
--
contribute
to
a
negligence
partial
recovery.
well,
i'm
urging
as
i
say,
i'm
not
urging
this
court
to
agree
that
this
is
a
jones
act
employee.
i'm
just
urging
a
constitutional
right
under
seventh
amendment
and
under
the
jones
act
to
present
this
to
the
jury
who
is
the
trier
of
fact.
it
may
be
argued
that
we
chose
a
convenient
forum
but
that's
the
prerogative
of
a
plaintiff.i
don't
know
that
we
necessarily
chose
the
convenient
forum
because
we've
lost
all
the
way
up,
but
we
did
choose
what
we
thought
would
be
the
better
forum.
we've
chose
state
over
the
deputy
commissioner.
we
have
no
problems
in
any
of
these
cases
with
the
deputy
commissioner.
if
we
urge
a
case
under
the
jones
act,
he
stays
his
proceedings.
we
have
no
problems
in
any
of
this
with
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
u.s.
deputy
commissioner
sees
our
point
completely
on
all
of
these
problems.
it's
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
or
the
trier
of
the
fact
to
decide.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
don't
know
yet,
your
honor.
i'll
have
to
examine
that
point
or
maybe.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir
i
understand
from
reading
reed
versus
yaka
that
i
have
an
in
personam
case
against
lykes
brothers
steamship
company,
inc.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
against
lykes
brothers
in
personam.
as
i
read
reed
versus
yaka
or
i
have
that
right
to
go
direct
against
the
ship
owner,
ship
operator
as
i
read
reed
versus
yaka.
that's
my
interpretation
of
reed
versus
yaka.
and
you
have
some
circuit
courts
that
have
agreed
with
me.
you
have
biggs
and
clowers,
i
believe,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
you
have
the
ninth
circuit
case.
i
think
my
time
has
gone
up.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
would
suggest
that
the
pleading
covers
and
includes
a
claim
for
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
if
it
wouldn't
have
we
could've
amended
that
specifically
to
cover
anything
that
wouldn't
have.
in
louisiana
pleadings,
article
1115
of
our
code
--
excuse
me
1151
and
1153
of
our
code
of
procedure
allows
you
to
amend
pleadings
prior
to
answer
or
after
answer
by
leave
of
court
and
any
amendment
goes
back
to
the
date
of
the
original
filling
and
likewise
if
our
pleadings
are
defective
with
reference
to
qualifications
of
a
personal
representative,
the
proper
court
was
the
same
court
we
were
in
to
qualify
her
as
an
administratrix,
if
that
had
to
be,
if
that's
what
they
would
have
required,
we
could've
qualified
the
rest.
she's
the
sole
surviving
wife
that
there
is
no
other
wife,
she's
a
lawful
marriage.
there
are
no
descendent
children.
there
are
no
mothers
or
fathers
involved.
she
is
the
only
one
who
was
involved.
she
could
have
qualified
under
any
test
as
the
personal
representative.
any
method
or
manner
that
they
wanted
us
to
fix
it
up,
we
could
have
fix
it,
amended
the
pleadings
and
go
back
to
the
date
of
the
original
filling.
the
case
that
was
cited
by
mr.
yancey
in
his
brief,
go
to
a
trial,
jury
trials,
judgments.
there's
been
no
jury
trial,
there
has
been
no
judgment.
if
this
is
reverted
back
to
the
district
court
i
can
still
amend
my
pleadings.
if
my
pleadings
had
effect
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no.
no
sir.
we
don't
--
we
have
very
few
jones
act
cases
in
louisiana
courts.
the
louisiana
courts
are
not
familiar
with
jones
act
cases,
and
we
have
no
body
of
law
built
up
with
reference
to
what
it
is
a
personal
representative.
there
maybe
some
vague
references
to
them
in
some
of
the
cases.
we
don't
have
any
great
body
but
we
do
have
a
liberal
pleading
as
far
as
amendments
that
you
can
have
amend
your
pleadings
and
go
back.
and
we
have
a
case
specifically
that
was
even
reviewed
by
this
court.
so
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
this
could
--
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
lanis
versus
illinois
central
railroad
company.
this
goes
back
in
1960,
140
louisiana
1,
72
southern
788.
it
was
a
reviewed
by
this
court,
38
supreme
court,
334,
246
u.s.
652.
in
this
particular
case
the
widow
sued
under
a
state
statute.
this
is
a
f-e-l-a
case
and
they
allowed
her,
she
stood
in
her
own
name
and
he
allowed
her
to
go
back
and
amend
her
pleadings
and
come
in
as
an
administratrix.
they
allowed
that
in
federal
court,
they
allowed
that
in
state
court.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
the
state
court
didn't
specifically
rule
on
this
particular
point
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no.
the
court
of
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
court
of
appeals
based
everything
on
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
on
905.
every
--
in
905
throughout
everything
that's
it.
or
every
question
that
was
presented
to
him
was
thrown
out
at
the
exclusion
cause
on
905.
and
that
was
the
reason
for
everything,
and
that's
why
we're
up
here.
i'd
like
to
say
one
--
i
don't
want
go
into
the
history
of
these.
but
the
haverty
case
brought
about
the
1927
amendment
for
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
but
it
wasn't
to
correct
false
in
the
haverty
case.
it
was
to
correct
lapse
in
the
haverty
case.
the
haverty
case
would
only
apply
to
longshoremen
who
were
employed
direct
as
luther
jackson
was.
the
great
mass
of
longshoremen,
at
that
time,
was
employed
by
independent
contractors.
therefore,
the
jones
act
was
not
available
for
them.
the
jones
act
was
no
remedy
for
the
great
mass
of
a
longshoreman
at
the
time
of
haverty.
it
was
satisfaction
to
the
longshoreman
in
haverty
to
be
able
to
come
to
make
a
claim
but
not
--
for
all
the
other
ones.
so
the
1927
act
for
longshoreman
corrected
this
and
gave
remedies
to
enlarge
not
to
restrict.
mr.
yancey
would
argue
that
the
idea
of
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
to
restrict,
that
i
disagree.
the
babin
case,
he
mentioned,
was
not
a
case
of
unseaworthiness.
the
attorneys
for
both
sides,
plaintiff
and
defendant
agreed
that
there
was
no
unseaworthiness.
i
don't
agree
with
their
interpretation,
but
the
attorneys
by
agreement
and
the
court,
all
parties
agreed
there
was
no
unseaworthiness
involved.
so
they
tried
it
on
negligence.
therefore
it
wouldn't
stand
for
the
proposition
we
have
before
us
here.
judge
putnam
is
an
ex-state
court
judge.
he
is
now
a
federal
court
judge
his
opinion
should
be
read.
and
there's
also
the
article
that
he
refers
to
by
(inaudible)
should
be
read
in
it.
that's
all
i
have
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
have
20
minutes
on
direct
and
10
on
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
can
i
begin
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes.
this
is
a
death
case.
this
is
a
death
case
involving
a
longshoreman
employed
by
lykes
brothers
steamship
company
inc.
lykes
brothers
is
a
steamship
operator
that
acted
as
a
stevedore,
acted
as
a
ship
owner
and
acted
as
a
ship
operator,
the
primary
purpose
instead
of
a
ship
operator
and
a
ship
owner.
stevedoring
is
only
secondary
ancillary
to
their
operation
of
the
ships.
they
have
approximately
45
ships
that
they
operate.
luther
jackson
was
a
longshoreman;
he
was
employed
to
board
one
of
the
vessels
owned
and
operated
by
lykes.
he
was
employed
direct
by
lykes.
in
the
course
of
this
employment,
he
was
caused
to
inhale
fumes
from
insecticide
which
ultimately
cause
or
contributed
to
his
death.
no
proceedings
were
had
in
this
case
before
the
u.s.
deputy
commissioner.
there's
no
award
here,
there
is
no
compensation
payments,
there
is
no
voluntary
or
involuntary
payments
of
compensation
under
the
deputy
commissioner
proceedings.
there
have
been
no
proceedings
before
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
first
proceeding
was
in
the
civil
district
court
for
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
civil
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
this
is
a
state
court.
this
is
a
state
court
forum.
suit
was
filed
in
a
state
court
forum
on
the
four
basic
counts.
number
one,
under
the
jones
act;
number
two,
under
the
general
maritime
law
has
supplemented
by
our
survivorship
and
wrongful
death
statute
2315;
and
number
three,
on
the
louisiana
tort;
number
four,
in
louisiana
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir.
they
denied
us
a
claim
under
the
jones
act.
they
denied
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
they
--
this
have
might
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir.
in
robinson
versus
lykes
there
was
no
death
and
this
judgment
of
jackson
versus
lykes
is
based
on
robinson
versus
lykes.
in
robinson
versus
lykes,
rufus
robinson
was
a
live
longshoreman,
but
they
denied
the
right
of
action
and
the
cause
of
action
in
general
maritime
law
under
rufus
robinson
versus
lykes
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
905,
section
905
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers
act
excluded
such
right.
and
they
were
to
based
it
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir,
under
rufus
robinson
that
would
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
crew,
they
said
he
would
have
had
a
jones
act
but
we
contend
that
there
was
a
question
of
fact
in
the
salute
to
judge
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
if
it
would
have
been
a
non-lykes
employee,
i
would
imagine
that
the
state
court
would
have
granted
him
a
right
in
cause
of
action
on
the
general
maritime
law.
since
we
file
so
few
of
these
suits
over
in
state
court,
i
really
can't
tell
you
--
tell
you
exactly
what
it
would
be
if
it
were
put
to
issue.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
in
federal
court,
we
file
this
type
all
the
time.
we
have
no
problem
like
this
in
federal
court.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
have
a
problem
with
ordinary
negligence
when
the
employer
is
a
direct
employer,
because
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
in
this
case
this
comes
within
the
scope
of
yaka
versus
reed
or
reed
versus
yaka,
so
we
have
a
problem
with
reference
to
negligence.
and
we
don't
know
exactly
whether
or
not
we
can
have
a
cause
of
action
if
the
mate
or
the
master,
or
one
of
the
regular
bosons
or
abs
or
members
of
the
crew
had
caused
or
created
an
unsafe
condition.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
don't
know
where
we
stand
on
that.
we
assume
that
the
courts
will
make
a
dichotomy
between
the
negligence
of
a
regular
member
of
the
crew
and
give
us
a
cause
of
action.
they
generally
throw
us
out
on
the
basis
that
a
fellow
longshoreman
has
created
the
unseaworthy
condition
or
that
he
has
caused
the
negligent
act
that
injured
him.
but
i
think
that
what
we
have
right
here
is
that
we've
been
denied
before
we
even
presented
any
facts.
we've
been
denied
on
a
summary
judgment.
we've
been
thrown
out
right
at
the
very
beginning
stating
that
we
have
no
right
of
action,
no
cause
of
action
for
a
claim
under
the
jones
act,
for
a
claim
under
general
maritime
law.
i'm
not
going
to
bring
up
louisiana
tort
law
because
that's
not
the
basis
for
this
appeal
or
i
won't
bring
up
louisiana
workmen's
comp,
that's
not
basis
of
this
appeal.
i
would
just
confine
myself
to
the
jones
act
and
to
general
maritime
law.
before
--
judge
carey
in
the
civil
district
court,
it
was
urged
that
whether
or
not
luther
jackson
was
a
member
of
the
crew,
is
a
question
of
fact.
it's
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide,
that
he
had
no
authority
to
make
that
decision
which
based
on
the
various
cases
that
you
don't
take
the
mere
name
that
this
is
a
longshoremen
act,
he
is
a
longshoreman
than
he's
automatically
as
matter
of
law
within
the
scope
of
the
longshoreman
act
just
like
a
railroad
employee,
if
he
was
a
brakeman,
he
isn't
automatically
within
the
scope
of
fela.
he
may
come
under
the
longshoremen
act
if
he's
over
navigable
waters
and
he
may
be
a
member
of
the
crew
if
he
has
aboard
a
vessel.
i
contented
before
judge
carey
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide.
and
he
felt
that
was
a
matter
of
absolute
law
that
he
couldn't
be
a
member
of
the
crew,
that
he
had
to
be
a
longshoreman
within
the
scope
of
the
longshoremen's
harbor
workers'
act.
my
second
argument
to
judge
carey
was
that
conceding
--
that
you
assumed
he's
a
member
--
that
he
cannot
be
a
member
of
the
crew.
then,
i
have
a
general
maritime
law
claim
for
my
client.
and
he
has
a
claim
based
on
the
warrant
of
seaworthi
--
seaworthiness
pursuant
to
reed
versus
yaka.
his
position
was
that
section
905
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
worker
act
precluded
any
claim
whatsoever
against
lykes
brothers
on
the
general
maritime
law.
his
position
was
that
this
was
the
same
problem
that
he
had
handled
in
ellis
versus
travelers
and
in
stepter
versus
t.
smith.
if
you
go
back
to
the
robinson
case,
you'll
find
that
there
is
a
quote
of
at
least
one
of
those
cases
in
the
robinson
versus
lykes
case.
and
he
based
his
decision
on
the
robinson
versus
lykes
decision
that
the
only
remedy
that
the
weather
had
was
pursuant
to
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act.
my
position
to
the
judge
was,
that
he
was
making
in
the
determination
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
that
this
particular
employee
was
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
that
he
was
making
the
determination
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
couldn't
be
a
seaman.
he
was
making
the
determination
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he
had
to
be
a
longshoreman
and
even
though
he
was
making
this
determination,
he
was
excluding
the
ruling
or
the
holding
at
least
to
the
spirit
of
reed
versus
yaka.
well,
i
lost
in
the
lower
court.
so
we
went
up
to
court
of
appeals.
all
these
same
points
were
urged
and
that
under
the
jones
act,
it
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine
that
it
would
not
be
as
a
matter
of
law
he
was
a
longshoreman.
it
had
--
it
was
a
question
of
fact
that
had
to
be
determined
by
the
deputy
commissioner,
since
the
deputy
commissioner
had
made
no
determination
it
was
moot.
and
in
this
case
before
the
court
of
appeals,
their
opinion
was
there
are
all
questions
which
included
the
louisiana
tort
and
louisiana
workmen's
comp.
all
the
questions
resolved
themselves
to
one
point,
33
u.s.c.
905
the
exclusive
remedy
clause.
and
their
position
was
that
the
exclusive
remedy
clause
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
excluded
this
man
from
being
a
member
of
the
crew,
excluded
this
man
from
having
any
rights
under
general
maritime
law
or
his
widow
and
precluded
any
claim
under
louisiana
tort
or
workmen's
comp.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
a
writ
was
applied
for.
the
writ
was
denied,
two
justices
dissented.
the
two
justices
were
saunders
and
samuel.
and
they
were
the
same
ones
who
dissented
in
robinson
versus
lykes
and
for
basically
the
same
reason
that
they
dissented
in
robertson
versus
lykes.
and
now
i'm
before
this
court
urging
the
same
thing,
i'm
urging
that
mrs.
jackson
has
a
right
to
bring
this
case
before
the
jury,
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
her
husband
was
a
member
of
the
crew.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
agree
that
she
--
that
her
husband
was
a
member
the
crew,
i'm
just
asking
for
the
right
to
bring
this
to
the
jury
to
let
them
make
the
determination.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
go
for
under
jones
act
and
general
maritime
law.
general
maritime
law
supplemented
by
2315.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
had
a
very
brief
minor
--
fewer
discussion
on
tungus,
goette,
hess
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
and
all
of
these
landmark
cases.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
very
little
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
our
state
--
that
statute
is
a
very
broad
death
statute.
i
quoted
it
in
my
brief.
and
it
would
be
my
position
that
this
death
statute
gives
more
than
general
maritime
law
would
give
because
we
have
a
civil
law
here,
and
we
have
other
statute
besides
2315.
we
have
667,
we
have
617,
we
have
2322,
2317.
we
have
a
number
of
state
statutes.
all
of
these
statutes
or
survive
under
2315.
we
even
have
some
admiralty
statutes.
this
wasn't
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
my
position
would
be
that
the
state
law
is
only
a
vehicle
--
is
only
a
vehicle
to
give
him
a
right
on
the
gen
--
give
the
widow
a
right
under
general
maritime
law.
my
view
would
be
the
--
my
minority
view
in
tungus.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well,
i
don't
say
overruling,
because
i
also
feel
that
the
2315
statute
of
state
of
louisiana
is
broad
enough
to
include
general
maritime
law.
this
comes
from
a
french
napoleonic
code.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
we
have
a
case
right
now.
that's
in
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
putnam
was
an
ex-state
court
judge,
was
in
the
western
district
for
the
state
of
louisiana
decided
the
grigsby
case.
and
he
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
this
case
is
now
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we're
hoping
that
the
fifth
circuit
will
affirm
his
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes.
he's
decided
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
he
has
decided
in
favor
of
the
widow
and
the
defendants.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
he
really
never
considered
this
here
a
problem
of
tungus.
he
was
only
concerned
with
that
we
had
no
right
of
action
or
cause
of
action
because
of
stepter
and
ellis.
ellis
and
stepter
were
a
conflict
between
state
compensation
and
federal
compensation.
and
that
went
back
to
the
richard's
decision.
in
the
richard's
decision,
they
would
allow
you
to
go
into
federal
court.
and
seek
that
workman's
compensation
in
the
federal
court
$70.00
a
week.
then
you
could
sue
into
the
state
act
for
a
lump-sum
settlement
which
was
not
provided
for
in
the
state
court
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
judge
putnam.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
that's
my
first
--
my
first
claim
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
but
if
i'm
wrong
under
the
jones
act
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
then
i
have
to
make
my
claim
under
general
maritime
law
and
then
i
have
to
resort
to
2315.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
he
was
doing
longshoreman
work
which
work
was
traditionally
that
of
the
seaman.
but
he
was
working
--
he
was
working
for
a
ship
operator
who
was
primarily
a
ship
operator
was
primarily
involved
in
ship
operation.
and
whose
stevedoring
was
only
secondary.
and
we
would
try
to
urge
to
the
jury
that
this
man
could
meet
the
test
of
being
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir
because
if
he
was
--
it
was
a
t.
smith
&
sons
situation,
t.
smith
is
a
stevedore.
mainly
there
is
a
stevedoring
operation.
well,
he
has
to
make
his
claim
under
the
jones
act
against
his
employer.
he
can't
make
it
against
the
ship
owner.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
he
must
make
it
against
his
employer.
t.
smith
&
son
does
not
operate
ships.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
want
to
first
urge
what
any
ordinary
bonafide
member
of
the
crew
would
urge
that
he
has
a
claim
under
the
jones
act
against
his
employer
who
is
a
ship
operator.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
alright,
i
lose
that.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
alright.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well,
the
longshoreman
--
the
longshoreman
have
a
traditional
third
party
claim
against
the
vessel.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
against
the
ship
operator.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
against
the
ship
and
in
pursuant
to
reed
versus
yaka
whoever
owns
the
ship.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
the
jones
act
claim
is
the
easiest.
the
maritime
claim
presents
problems.
maritime
claim
presents
problems
of
negligence
and
who
was
negligent
if
the
wrong
posed
negligence
you
wouldn't
have
any
claim.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
that's
a
little
problem
in
louisiana.
we
have
a
statute
for
comparative
negligence,
but
it's
been
ignored.
it's
completely
ignored
and
they
followed
the
common
law
rules.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
well,
this
should
be
maritime
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
you're
right.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
if
tungus
were
overruled
then
this
would
be
comparative.
if
tungus
wasn't
overruled
then
this
would
be
--
contribute
to
a
negligence
partial
recovery.
well,
i'm
urging
as
i
say,
i'm
not
urging
this
court
to
agree
that
this
is
a
jones
act
employee.
i'm
just
urging
a
constitutional
right
under
seventh
amendment
and
under
the
jones
act
to
present
this
to
the
jury
who
is
the
trier
of
fact.
it
may
be
argued
that
we
chose
a
convenient
forum
but
that's
the
prerogative
of
a
plaintiff.i
don't
know
that
we
necessarily
chose
the
convenient
forum
because
we've
lost
all
the
way
up,
but
we
did
choose
what
we
thought
would
be
the
better
forum.
we've
chose
state
over
the
deputy
commissioner.
we
have
no
problems
in
any
of
these
cases
with
the
deputy
commissioner.
if
we
urge
a
case
under
the
jones
act,
he
stays
his
proceedings.
we
have
no
problems
in
any
of
this
with
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
u.s.
deputy
commissioner
sees
our
point
completely
on
all
of
these
problems.
it's
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
or
the
trier
of
the
fact
to
decide.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
don't
know
yet,
your
honor.
i'll
have
to
examine
that
point
or
maybe.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no
sir
i
understand
from
reading
reed
versus
yaka
that
i
have
an
in
personam
case
against
lykes
brothers
steamship
company,
inc.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
against
lykes
brothers
in
personam.
as
i
read
reed
versus
yaka
or
i
have
that
right
to
go
direct
against
the
ship
owner,
ship
operator
as
i
read
reed
versus
yaka.
that's
my
interpretation
of
reed
versus
yaka.
and
you
have
some
circuit
courts
that
have
agreed
with
me.
you
have
biggs
and
clowers,
i
believe,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
you
have
the
ninth
circuit
case.
i
think
my
time
has
gone
up.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
i
would
suggest
that
the
pleading
covers
and
includes
a
claim
for
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
if
it
wouldn't
have
we
could've
amended
that
specifically
to
cover
anything
that
wouldn't
have.
in
louisiana
pleadings,
article
1115
of
our
code
--
excuse
me
1151
and
1153
of
our
code
of
procedure
allows
you
to
amend
pleadings
prior
to
answer
or
after
answer
by
leave
of
court
and
any
amendment
goes
back
to
the
date
of
the
original
filling
and
likewise
if
our
pleadings
are
defective
with
reference
to
qualifications
of
a
personal
representative,
the
proper
court
was
the
same
court
we
were
in
to
qualify
her
as
an
administratrix,
if
that
had
to
be,
if
that's
what
they
would
have
required,
we
could've
qualified
the
rest.
she's
the
sole
surviving
wife
that
there
is
no
other
wife,
she's
a
lawful
marriage.
there
are
no
descendent
children.
there
are
no
mothers
or
fathers
involved.
she
is
the
only
one
who
was
involved.
she
could
have
qualified
under
any
test
as
the
personal
representative.
any
method
or
manner
that
they
wanted
us
to
fix
it
up,
we
could
have
fix
it,
amended
the
pleadings
and
go
back
to
the
date
of
the
original
filling.
the
case
that
was
cited
by
mr.
yancey
in
his
brief,
go
to
a
trial,
jury
trials,
judgments.
there's
been
no
jury
trial,
there
has
been
no
judgment.
if
this
is
reverted
back
to
the
district
court
i
can
still
amend
my
pleadings.
if
my
pleadings
had
effect
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no.
no
sir.
we
don't
--
we
have
very
few
jones
act
cases
in
louisiana
courts.
the
louisiana
courts
are
not
familiar
with
jones
act
cases,
and
we
have
no
body
of
law
built
up
with
reference
to
what
it
is
a
personal
representative.
there
maybe
some
vague
references
to
them
in
some
of
the
cases.
we
don't
have
any
great
body
but
we
do
have
a
liberal
pleading
as
far
as
amendments
that
you
can
have
amend
your
pleadings
and
go
back.
and
we
have
a
case
specifically
that
was
even
reviewed
by
this
court.
so
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
this
could
--
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
lanis
versus
illinois
central
railroad
company.
this
goes
back
in
1960,
140
louisiana
1,
72
southern
788.
it
was
a
reviewed
by
this
court,
38
supreme
court,
334,
246
u.s.
652.
in
this
particular
case
the
widow
sued
under
a
state
statute.
this
is
a
f-e-l-a
case
and
they
allowed
her,
she
stood
in
her
own
name
and
he
allowed
her
to
go
back
and
amend
her
pleadings
and
come
in
as
an
administratrix.
they
allowed
that
in
federal
court,
they
allowed
that
in
state
court.
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
sir?
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
the
state
court
didn't
specifically
rule
on
this
particular
point
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
no.
the
court
of
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
court
of
appeals
based
everything
on
--
mr.
charles
r.
maloney
--
on
905.
every
--
in
905
throughout
everything
that's
it.
or
every
question
that
was
presented
to
him
was
thrown
out
at
the
exclusion
cause
on
905.
and
that
was
the
reason
for
everything,
and
that's
why
we're
up
here.
i'd
like
to
say
one
--
i
don't
want
go
into
the
history
of
these.
but
the
haverty
case
brought
about
the
1927
amendment
for
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
but
it
wasn't
to
correct
false
in
the
haverty
case.
it
was
to
correct
lapse
in
the
haverty
case.
the
haverty
case
would
only
apply
to
longshoremen
who
were
employed
direct
as
luther
jackson
was.
the
great
mass
of
longshoremen,
at
that
time,
was
employed
by
independent
contractors.
therefore,
the
jones
act
was
not
available
for
them.
the
jones
act
was
no
remedy
for
the
great
mass
of
a
longshoreman
at
the
time
of
haverty.
it
was
satisfaction
to
the
longshoreman
in
haverty
to
be
able
to
come
to
make
a
claim
but
not
--
for
all
the
other
ones.
so
the
1927
act
for
longshoreman
corrected
this
and
gave
remedies
to
enlarge
not
to
restrict.
mr.
yancey
would
argue
that
the
idea
of
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
to
restrict,
that
i
disagree.
the
babin
case,
he
mentioned,
was
not
a
case
of
unseaworthiness.
the
attorneys
for
both
sides,
plaintiff
and
defendant
agreed
that
there
was
no
unseaworthiness.
i
don't
agree
with
their
interpretation,
but
the
attorneys
by
agreement
and
the
court,
all
parties
agreed
there
was
no
unseaworthiness
involved.
so
they
tried
it
on
negligence.
therefore
it
wouldn't
stand
for
the
proposition
we
have
before
us
here.
judge
putnam
is
an
ex-state
court
judge.
he
is
now
a
federal
court
judge
his
opinion
should
be
read.
and
there's
also
the
article
that
he
refers
to
by
(inaudible)
should
be
read
in
it.
that's
all
i
have
to
say,
your
honor.
