what
did
you
say,
his

this

judge
putnam

says
that
in

plan,
there
is
a

you
suggest

well,
is
this
correct

i
gather
the

that
mr.
yancey
makes
is
that
under
jones
act
you
have
not

they're
properly
pleaded
a
jones
act
claim
because
that
will
be
pleaded
in
the
death
case
only
by
a
personal
representative
that
louisiana
practices
as

understood
requires
an
allegation
that
indeed
she
is
by

you'd
never
made

qualify
