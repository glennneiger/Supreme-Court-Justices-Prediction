mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
real
nub
of
this
case
is
the
exclusive
feature
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
this
is
the
first
case
before
this
court
where
there
has
been
an
effort
to
fix
personal
liability
for
damages
for
negligence
on
the
employer
in
a
longshoreman's
case.
now,
the
original
petition
that
is
the
complaint
below
is
specifically
predicated
upon
negligence.
it
alleges
that
lykes
failed
to
do
certain
specific
things
which
brought
about
the
death
of
the
decedent.
the
first
allegation
in
the
petition
was
that
the
decedent
was
a
longshoreman
engaged
in
the
cargo
operations
of
the
vessel.
having
alleged
that
the
decedent
was
a
longshoreman
engaged
in
the
operation
of
the
vessel
and
then
having
specified
the
negligence,
the
first
claim
is
made
under
the
jones
act.
then
it
claims
under
the
general
maritime
law
then
it
claims
under
the
louisiana
death
statute.
all
cumulatively
nothing
alternatively
and
then
serves
a
copy
of
the
petition
on
the
united
state
deputy
compensation
commissioner
to
preserve
the
rights
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
and
finally,
claims
under
the
louisiana
workmen's
compensation
act.
now
to
this,
we
filed
exceptions.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
yes
sir
i
included,
i
meant
to
include
that
when
said
it
claimed
under
the
jones
act.
because
in
order
to
claim
under
the
jones
act,
he
had
to
allege
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
right.
now,
to
this
cumulative
package
of
claims,
we
filed
exceptions.
first,
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
widow
of
this
longshoreman.
second,
as
to
the
jones
act
that
the
jones
act
itself
as
the
court
well
knows
vests
the
cause
of
action
in
the
personal
representative
of
the
decedent
and
under
louisiana
law
and
under
federal
law,
the
widow
has
no
standing
in
court
to
pursue
any
right
under
the
jones
act.
the
person
in
whom
the
jones
act
vests
the
cause
of
action
is
a
duly
qualified
administratrix
or
executrix
of
the
decedent's
estate.
that
vital
lack
in
this
petition,
this
original
petition
was
called
to
the
attention
of
our
friend
illuminate
and
then
never
has
been
any
attempt
to
correct
that.
although
under
louisiana
practice,
any
defect
of
that
time
brought
to
the
court's
attention
can
be
the
subject
to
proofing
of
amendment.
there's
never
been
any
offer
of
proof
and
then
never
any
offer
of
amendment.
so
that
when
my
friend
stands
in
the
highest
court
in
this
land
urging
the
jones
act
he
has
no
right
to
stand
in
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
that
is
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
if
you
please
sir,
that
is
a
conclusion
of
the
pleader.
that
is
no
allegation
and
so
far
as
we
know
never
has
been
any
allegation
that
an
executrix
or
administratrix
has
been
appointed.
that
is
a
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
--
bold
allegation
of
plea
--
of
the
conclusion
of
the
pleader.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
he
alleges
that
she
is
the
duly
qualified
administratrix
by
the
judgment
of
such
and
such
a
court.
but
--
and
that
of
course
is
in
my
judgment
vital
to
this
jones
act
business
in
this
court.
but
i
go
one
step
further.
i
say
that
so
far
as
jones
act
is
concerned,
if
the
court
please,
a
longshoreman
is
the
type
of
person
for
whom
this
longshoremen's
act
specifically
was
passed.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
and
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
if
you
mean
that
there
was
a
third
party
whom
he
could
sue?
of
course
not
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
he
would
have
a
right
to
sue
the
ship,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
and
the
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
precisely.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
precisely,
that
is
the
(voice
overlap)
exact
point
of
the
case.
now,
i
don't
want
to
launch
into
any
extended
history
but
as
your
honors
know,
this
whole
thing
flows
from
the
jensen
case
where
in
1917
a
longshoreman
employed
as
in
this
case
by
the
ship
owner,
they
attempted
to
avail
himself
if
he
was
killed
incidentally,
his
widow
attempting
to
avail
herself
of
the
new
york
compensation
act.
and
in
jensen,
this
court
held
that
the
uniformity
of
the
maritime
law
required
rather
prevented
the
application
of
individual
compensation
acts
of
the
various
states.
after
two
efforts
by
congress
to
relegate
the
questions
of
the
states,
this
court
in
the
grand
smith
case
strongly
headed
to
congress
to
the
thing
they
do
for
longshoreman
was
to
pass
a
longshoremen's
act.
congress
did
not
act
immediately
but
in
1926,
this
court
held
in
the
haverty
case
that
a
longshoreman
was
a
seaman
as
against
his
employer
and
was
entitled
to
the
rights
under
the
jones
act.
congress
then
and
there
in
1927
passed
the
longshoremen's
act
to
correct
the
decision
of
the
haverty
case
and
to
give
longshoreman
the
very
character
of
employee
which
we
have
here.
give
the
longshoreman
a
carefully
thought
out
compensation
plan
that
has
been
held
constitutional.
and
it's
been
the
subject
of
some
litigation
in
this
court.
the
longshoremen's
act
covers
two
situations.
it
carefully
preserves
the
injured
employee's
rights
against
their
bodies.
and
as
against
the
employer,
it
makes
the
provisions
of
the
act
exclusive.
exclusive
of
all
other
liability
whether
in
admirality
or
at
law.
now,
in
sieracki,
this
court
held
that
the
longshoreman
injured
by
unseaworthiness
of
a
third
party's
vessel
had
the
same
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
a
seaman
had
and
could
recover
damages.
then
ryan
comes
along
and
ryan
recovers
from
the
steamship
owner
a
typical
third
party
situation.
and
the
ship
owner
impleads
the
stevedore
employer
because
the
stevedore's
negligence
had
brought
about
the
unseaworthy
condition
which
had
cast
the
ship
owner
in
damages.
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
ryan
that
there
was
an
implied
warranty
of
workmanlike
performance
running
between
the
stevedore
employer
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ship
owner
on
the
other.
it
was
a
strong
defense
and
the
principal
thing
which
concerned
the
dissenters
was
that
this
implied
indemnity
which
the
court
found
running
between
the
stevedore
employer
and
the
ship
owner
warranty
of
workmanlike
performance
was
a
violation
of
section
5.
then
comes
yaka,
in
fact
that's
why
we're
here,
yaka.
yaka
was
a
suite
by
a
longshoreman
against
a
vessel
in
rem,
vessel
not
owned
by
his
employer
but
bareboat
chartered
to
his
employer
under
a
bareboat
charter
which
contained
and
expressed
indemnity
of
the
charterer
and
of
the
ship
owner
by
the
charterer
for
anything
arising
in
the
operation
of
the
ship.
it
had
been
emphasized
in
the
dissent
in
ryan
that
if
there
had
been
an
expressed
indemnity
in
ryan,
the
dissenters
would
have
gone
along
with
the
majority
with
what
the
dissenters
objected
to,
was
this
implying
of
a
warrant.
now,
in
the
district
court
in
yaka,
there
was
a
decree
in
rem
against
the
shipment
and
there
was
a
decree
over
against
the
bareboat
charterer's
stevedore
employer
under
the
express
indemnity.
when
that
case
got
to
the
third
circuit
the
arguments
went
allover
the
place.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court
although
the
indemnity,
the
real
basis
on
which
the
case
was
decided,
the
indemnity
was
mentioned,
it
was
more
or
less
lost
cite
of
and
the
case
was
decided
in
this
court
on
more
general
grounds.
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
yaka
and
i
want
to
say
this
as
strongly
and
as
sincerely
as
i
can.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
facts
of
yaka
which
justify
this
longshoreman's
widow
suing
her
decedent
employer
direct
in
the
face
of
that
exclusive
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
now,
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
louisiana
court
in
spite
of
what
my
friend
had
said,
have
not
passed
upon
that.
judge
putnam
in
the
western
district
has
said
that
in
dictum.
and
that
case
is
now
for
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
right.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
right.
now,
there
is
the
occasion
in
the
state
courts
which
is
rather
weak
as
i
have
say
is
judge
putnam's
cases
weak
which
says
the
other.
but
the
--
i
did
not
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
no
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
that
is
a
case
of
a
babin,
b-a-b-i-n
versus
lykes
the
citation
of
which
i
do
not
have
but
i
can
get
for
you
if
you
want
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
parish
of
orleans
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
this
position
of
that
point
in
this
court
is
that
the
louisiana
courts
have
not
in
fact
passed
upon
that
question
and
under
tungus,
it
is
their
province
to
pass
upon
it
and
in
this
particular
litigation
they
didn't
reach
it
because
they
felt
that
the
exclusive
provisions
of
the
section
5
bother
from
going
any
further.
now,
i
want
to
say
in
a
few
words
that
if
the
position
of
my
friend
is
maintained
in
this
court
that
section
5
of
the
longshoreman's
act
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
and
that
a
longshoreman
is
free
to
sue
his
ship
owner,
operator,
stevedore
employer
for
damages.
and
of
course
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
is
immediately
cast
into
doubt.
the
basis
on
which
the
longshoremen's
act,
all
compensation
acts
have
been
held
to
be
constitutional
is
the
quid
pro
quo.
the
employer
gives
up
defenses.
the
employer
is
liable
without
fault
for
stated
amounts.
the
employee
gives
up
the
right
to
sue
but
he
in
return
back,
he
gets
a
fix
amount.
in
other
words
as
the
courts
have
said
many,
many
times
it
was
a
quid
pro
quo.
and
with
no
intention
to
be
anything
but
deadly
serious,
what
my
friend
is
suggesting
here
is
that
congress
having
given
him
the
quid.
now,
this
case
should
--
this
court
should
give
him
the
quo,
and
leave
the
employer
with
absolutely
nothing
under
this
act.
and
aside
from
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
position,
i'm
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
position
makes
absolutely
meaningless.
the
third
party
provisions
contained
in
section
33
of
the
act,
congress
envisioned
--
envisaged
the
right
to
sue
a
third
party
and
preserving
that
provided
that
if
the
employer
pursues
that
right
against
the
third
party,
the
employer
must
account
to
the
employee
for
anything
over
the
recovery
after
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
if
the
employee
pursues
the
rights
against
the
third
party
then
if
he
settles
without
the
employer's
permission,
in
other
words,
protecting
the
employer's
right
in
the
suit
against
the
third
party
then,
the
right
to
further
compensation
is
lost.
now,
of
course
this
position
makes
hash
of
those
provisions.
we
can't
sue
ourselves.
the
position
really
is
that
we
are
liable
without
fault
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
we
are
liable
without
fault
for
unseaworthiness.
we
are
liable
with
fault
for
negligence
and
incidentally
i
reiterate
this
suite
is
based
on
negligence
and
we
are
liable
under
the
jones
act.
of
course,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
--
well,
my
real
point
is
that
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
as
between
employer
and
employee
exclusive
and
incidentally
but
a
congressional
intent.
before
i
sit
down,
there've
been
one
or
two
remarks
in
decisions
by
this
court
about
congressional
intent.
in
1959,
i
mentioned
that
it
in
the
brief,
after
this
court
had
decided
sieracki,
after
this
court
had
decided
ryan,
the
provisions
of
section
33
for
the
third
party
practice
were
amended
and
liberalized
and
in
the
senate
report
with
the
whole
background
to
sieracki
and
ryan
before
it,
in
the
senate
report,
the
reporters
reiterate
the
exclusive
feature
of
the
longshoremen's
act
as
between
employer
and
employee.
one
final
word,
there's
an
effort
to
split
our
personality
into
ship
owner,
stevedore
employer
that
if
the
court
please
in
my
humble
judgment
won't
wash.
when
the
longshoremen's
act
was
passed
in
1927,
it
was
known,
as
jensen
explained,
it
was
known
that
many
ship
owners
did
their
own
stevedoring,
so
that
the
longshoremen's
act
was
passed
in
1927
with
this
situation
in
focus.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
real
nub
of
this
case
is
the
exclusive
feature
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
this
is
the
first
case
before
this
court
where
there
has
been
an
effort
to
fix
personal
liability
for
damages
for
negligence
on
the
employer
in
a
longshoreman's
case.
now,
the
original
petition
that
is
the
complaint
below
is
specifically
predicated
upon
negligence.
it
alleges
that
lykes
failed
to
do
certain
specific
things
which
brought
about
the
death
of
the
decedent.
the
first
allegation
in
the
petition
was
that
the
decedent
was
a
longshoreman
engaged
in
the
cargo
operations
of
the
vessel.
having
alleged
that
the
decedent
was
a
longshoreman
engaged
in
the
operation
of
the
vessel
and
then
having
specified
the
negligence,
the
first
claim
is
made
under
the
jones
act.
then
it
claims
under
the
general
maritime
law
then
it
claims
under
the
louisiana
death
statute.
all
cumulatively
nothing
alternatively
and
then
serves
a
copy
of
the
petition
on
the
united
state
deputy
compensation
commissioner
to
preserve
the
rights
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
and
finally,
claims
under
the
louisiana
workmen's
compensation
act.
now
to
this,
we
filed
exceptions.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
yes
sir
i
included,
i
meant
to
include
that
when
said
it
claimed
under
the
jones
act.
because
in
order
to
claim
under
the
jones
act,
he
had
to
allege
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
right.
now,
to
this
cumulative
package
of
claims,
we
filed
exceptions.
first,
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
widow
of
this
longshoreman.
second,
as
to
the
jones
act
that
the
jones
act
itself
as
the
court
well
knows
vests
the
cause
of
action
in
the
personal
representative
of
the
decedent
and
under
louisiana
law
and
under
federal
law,
the
widow
has
no
standing
in
court
to
pursue
any
right
under
the
jones
act.
the
person
in
whom
the
jones
act
vests
the
cause
of
action
is
a
duly
qualified
administratrix
or
executrix
of
the
decedent's
estate.
that
vital
lack
in
this
petition,
this
original
petition
was
called
to
the
attention
of
our
friend
illuminate
and
then
never
has
been
any
attempt
to
correct
that.
although
under
louisiana
practice,
any
defect
of
that
time
brought
to
the
court's
attention
can
be
the
subject
to
proofing
of
amendment.
there's
never
been
any
offer
of
proof
and
then
never
any
offer
of
amendment.
so
that
when
my
friend
stands
in
the
highest
court
in
this
land
urging
the
jones
act
he
has
no
right
to
stand
in
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
that
is
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
if
you
please
sir,
that
is
a
conclusion
of
the
pleader.
that
is
no
allegation
and
so
far
as
we
know
never
has
been
any
allegation
that
an
executrix
or
administratrix
has
been
appointed.
that
is
a
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
--
bold
allegation
of
plea
--
of
the
conclusion
of
the
pleader.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
he
alleges
that
she
is
the
duly
qualified
administratrix
by
the
judgment
of
such
and
such
a
court.
but
--
and
that
of
course
is
in
my
judgment
vital
to
this
jones
act
business
in
this
court.
but
i
go
one
step
further.
i
say
that
so
far
as
jones
act
is
concerned,
if
the
court
please,
a
longshoreman
is
the
type
of
person
for
whom
this
longshoremen's
act
specifically
was
passed.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
and
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
if
you
mean
that
there
was
a
third
party
whom
he
could
sue?
of
course
not
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
he
would
have
a
right
to
sue
the
ship,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
and
the
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
precisely.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
precisely,
that
is
the
(voice
overlap)
exact
point
of
the
case.
now,
i
don't
want
to
launch
into
any
extended
history
but
as
your
honors
know,
this
whole
thing
flows
from
the
jensen
case
where
in
1917
a
longshoreman
employed
as
in
this
case
by
the
ship
owner,
they
attempted
to
avail
himself
if
he
was
killed
incidentally,
his
widow
attempting
to
avail
herself
of
the
new
york
compensation
act.
and
in
jensen,
this
court
held
that
the
uniformity
of
the
maritime
law
required
rather
prevented
the
application
of
individual
compensation
acts
of
the
various
states.
after
two
efforts
by
congress
to
relegate
the
questions
of
the
states,
this
court
in
the
grand
smith
case
strongly
headed
to
congress
to
the
thing
they
do
for
longshoreman
was
to
pass
a
longshoremen's
act.
congress
did
not
act
immediately
but
in
1926,
this
court
held
in
the
haverty
case
that
a
longshoreman
was
a
seaman
as
against
his
employer
and
was
entitled
to
the
rights
under
the
jones
act.
congress
then
and
there
in
1927
passed
the
longshoremen's
act
to
correct
the
decision
of
the
haverty
case
and
to
give
longshoreman
the
very
character
of
employee
which
we
have
here.
give
the
longshoreman
a
carefully
thought
out
compensation
plan
that
has
been
held
constitutional.
and
it's
been
the
subject
of
some
litigation
in
this
court.
the
longshoremen's
act
covers
two
situations.
it
carefully
preserves
the
injured
employee's
rights
against
their
bodies.
and
as
against
the
employer,
it
makes
the
provisions
of
the
act
exclusive.
exclusive
of
all
other
liability
whether
in
admirality
or
at
law.
now,
in
sieracki,
this
court
held
that
the
longshoreman
injured
by
unseaworthiness
of
a
third
party's
vessel
had
the
same
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
a
seaman
had
and
could
recover
damages.
then
ryan
comes
along
and
ryan
recovers
from
the
steamship
owner
a
typical
third
party
situation.
and
the
ship
owner
impleads
the
stevedore
employer
because
the
stevedore's
negligence
had
brought
about
the
unseaworthy
condition
which
had
cast
the
ship
owner
in
damages.
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
ryan
that
there
was
an
implied
warranty
of
workmanlike
performance
running
between
the
stevedore
employer
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ship
owner
on
the
other.
it
was
a
strong
defense
and
the
principal
thing
which
concerned
the
dissenters
was
that
this
implied
indemnity
which
the
court
found
running
between
the
stevedore
employer
and
the
ship
owner
warranty
of
workmanlike
performance
was
a
violation
of
section
5.
then
comes
yaka,
in
fact
that's
why
we're
here,
yaka.
yaka
was
a
suite
by
a
longshoreman
against
a
vessel
in
rem,
vessel
not
owned
by
his
employer
but
bareboat
chartered
to
his
employer
under
a
bareboat
charter
which
contained
and
expressed
indemnity
of
the
charterer
and
of
the
ship
owner
by
the
charterer
for
anything
arising
in
the
operation
of
the
ship.
it
had
been
emphasized
in
the
dissent
in
ryan
that
if
there
had
been
an
expressed
indemnity
in
ryan,
the
dissenters
would
have
gone
along
with
the
majority
with
what
the
dissenters
objected
to,
was
this
implying
of
a
warrant.
now,
in
the
district
court
in
yaka,
there
was
a
decree
in
rem
against
the
shipment
and
there
was
a
decree
over
against
the
bareboat
charterer's
stevedore
employer
under
the
express
indemnity.
when
that
case
got
to
the
third
circuit
the
arguments
went
allover
the
place.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court
although
the
indemnity,
the
real
basis
on
which
the
case
was
decided,
the
indemnity
was
mentioned,
it
was
more
or
less
lost
cite
of
and
the
case
was
decided
in
this
court
on
more
general
grounds.
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
yaka
and
i
want
to
say
this
as
strongly
and
as
sincerely
as
i
can.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
facts
of
yaka
which
justify
this
longshoreman's
widow
suing
her
decedent
employer
direct
in
the
face
of
that
exclusive
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
now,
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
louisiana
court
in
spite
of
what
my
friend
had
said,
have
not
passed
upon
that.
judge
putnam
in
the
western
district
has
said
that
in
dictum.
and
that
case
is
now
for
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
right.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
right.
now,
there
is
the
occasion
in
the
state
courts
which
is
rather
weak
as
i
have
say
is
judge
putnam's
cases
weak
which
says
the
other.
but
the
--
i
did
not
--
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
no
sir.
mr.
benjamin
w.
yancey
that
is
a
case
of
a
babin,
b-a-b-i-n
versus
lykes
the
citation
of
which
i
do
not
have
but
i
can
get
for
you
if
you
want
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
parish
of
orleans
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
this
position
of
that
point
in
this
court
is
that
the
louisiana
courts
have
not
in
fact
passed
upon
that
question
and
under
tungus,
it
is
their
province
to
pass
upon
it
and
in
this
particular
litigation
they
didn't
reach
it
because
they
felt
that
the
exclusive
provisions
of
the
section
5
bother
from
going
any
further.
now,
i
want
to
say
in
a
few
words
that
if
the
position
of
my
friend
is
maintained
in
this
court
that
section
5
of
the
longshoreman's
act
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
and
that
a
longshoreman
is
free
to
sue
his
ship
owner,
operator,
stevedore
employer
for
damages.
and
of
course
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
is
immediately
cast
into
doubt.
the
basis
on
which
the
longshoremen's
act,
all
compensation
acts
have
been
held
to
be
constitutional
is
the
quid
pro
quo.
the
employer
gives
up
defenses.
the
employer
is
liable
without
fault
for
stated
amounts.
the
employee
gives
up
the
right
to
sue
but
he
in
return
back,
he
gets
a
fix
amount.
in
other
words
as
the
courts
have
said
many,
many
times
it
was
a
quid
pro
quo.
and
with
no
intention
to
be
anything
but
deadly
serious,
what
my
friend
is
suggesting
here
is
that
congress
having
given
him
the
quid.
now,
this
case
should
--
this
court
should
give
him
the
quo,
and
leave
the
employer
with
absolutely
nothing
under
this
act.
and
aside
from
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
position,
i'm
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
position
makes
absolutely
meaningless.
the
third
party
provisions
contained
in
section
33
of
the
act,
congress
envisioned
--
envisaged
the
right
to
sue
a
third
party
and
preserving
that
provided
that
if
the
employer
pursues
that
right
against
the
third
party,
the
employer
must
account
to
the
employee
for
anything
over
the
recovery
after
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
if
the
employee
pursues
the
rights
against
the
third
party
then
if
he
settles
without
the
employer's
permission,
in
other
words,
protecting
the
employer's
right
in
the
suit
against
the
third
party
then,
the
right
to
further
compensation
is
lost.
now,
of
course
this
position
makes
hash
of
those
provisions.
we
can't
sue
ourselves.
the
position
really
is
that
we
are
liable
without
fault
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
we
are
liable
without
fault
for
unseaworthiness.
we
are
liable
with
fault
for
negligence
and
incidentally
i
reiterate
this
suite
is
based
on
negligence
and
we
are
liable
under
the
jones
act.
of
course,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
--
well,
my
real
point
is
that
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
as
between
employer
and
employee
exclusive
and
incidentally
but
a
congressional
intent.
before
i
sit
down,
there've
been
one
or
two
remarks
in
decisions
by
this
court
about
congressional
intent.
in
1959,
i
mentioned
that
it
in
the
brief,
after
this
court
had
decided
sieracki,
after
this
court
had
decided
ryan,
the
provisions
of
section
33
for
the
third
party
practice
were
amended
and
liberalized
and
in
the
senate
report
with
the
whole
background
to
sieracki
and
ryan
before
it,
in
the
senate
report,
the
reporters
reiterate
the
exclusive
feature
of
the
longshoremen's
act
as
between
employer
and
employee.
one
final
word,
there's
an
effort
to
split
our
personality
into
ship
owner,
stevedore
employer
that
if
the
court
please
in
my
humble
judgment
won't
wash.
when
the
longshoremen's
act
was
passed
in
1927,
it
was
known,
as
jensen
explained,
it
was
known
that
many
ship
owners
did
their
own
stevedoring,
so
that
the
longshoremen's
act
was
passed
in
1927
with
this
situation
in
focus.
thank
you,
sir.
