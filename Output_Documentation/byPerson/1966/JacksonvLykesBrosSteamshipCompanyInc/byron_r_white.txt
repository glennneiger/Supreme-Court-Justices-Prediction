justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
question
in
this
case
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
death
involved
that
you
would
have
had
a
maritime
cause
of
action
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
different,
that's
a
different
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
there
hadn't
been
a
death
wholly
aside
that
in
the
jones
act
you
would
have
had
a
maritime
cause
of
action
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
that
they
said
that
against
that
particular
employer,
the
longshoremen's
act
was
exclusive.
that
was
the
basis
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
had
been
a
seaman
--
if
he
had
been
a
seaman,
he
would
have
had
a
maritime
cause
of
action
for
ordinary
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
if
the
owner
of
the
vessel
here
had
not
been
the
stevedore,
let's
assume
it
is
an
ordinary
owner,
it
wasn't
a
stevedore
also.
and
then
a
longshoreman
is
injured
on
the
vessel,
he
had
a
maritime
cause
of
action
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
such
a
cause
of
action
presented
in
some
court,
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
longshoreman
can
--
can
--
who
isn't
killed
and
sue
the
ship
owner
for
unseaworthiness
and
also
ordinary
negligence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
a
maritime
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
--
let's
assume
that
you
were
right,
assume
you're
right
on
the
fact
that
the
harbor
workers'
act
does
not
bar
you
from
seeking
some
kind
of
a
relief,
some
kind
of
other
relief,
do
you
rely
on
both
the
jones
act
and
general
maritime
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
did
the
louisiana
court
here
reach
the
question
of
whether
under
the
local
law,
the
death
--
the
remedies
on
death
reaches
the
maritime
causes
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
read
that
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
read
it,
they
did
not
--
we
have
no
rule
again
in
this
case
anyway
as
to
whether
the
appointment
of
the
state
courts,
your
state
statute
reaches
--
your
death
statute
would
reach
this
kind
of
a
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
position
as
to
the
law
that
governs
whether
or
not
the
state
remedy
is
available
to
supplement
admiralty
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
--
you
mean
that
--
well,
in
your
cause
of
action
on
the
general
maritime
approach
is
you
think
rest
on
overruling
tungus?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
no
--
you
have
no
construction
of
your
state
statute
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
--
so
that
if
this
is
a
federal
question,
the
federal
law
of
government
in
general,
at
least
the
trial
court's
decision
in
that
case
is
persuasive
as
to
what
the
state
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
big
--
it
was
the
same
thing
truly
the
longshoreman.
it's
true
that
isn't
fair
with
the
stevedore.
stevedore
was
the
acting
ship
operator
but
he
was
still
doing
longshoreman's
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
there's
been
some
other
operator
of
the
ship,
does
it
take
the
difficult
ship
operator
goes
in
being
unloaded
by
longshoreman?
justice
byron
r.
white
longshoreman
is
hurt
on
the
ship.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
hasn't
enjoyed
that
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
that
the
situation
was
given
here
because
stevedore
here
was
the
ship
operator
and
he
was
the
employer
of
the
stevedore?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
can
make
the
claim
against
his
employer,
but
if
he's
going
to
make
it
against
his
employer
then
you
know
what
you'll
get
little
bit
cut
off
by
the
longshoremen's
act.
you
want
to
get
out
on
the
longshoremen's
act
because
it
was
on
the
ship
and
--
and
you
want
that
you
go
on
and
get
back
under
it
for
that
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
the
ship
operator?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
there
be
a
difference
between
your
general
maritime
and
negligence
plan
to
get
the
operator
in
the
jones
act
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jones
act
claim
would
be
easier?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
comparative
negligence
in
louisiana
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
should
be
the
maritime
law,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
should
be
the
maritime
law,
wouldn't'
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
wouldn't
say
that
this
longshoreman
would
be
barred
by
the
longshoremen's
act,
if
there
had
been
someone
else
operating
the
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
he's
--
if
that
stevedore
employer
haven't
been
operating
the
ship,
he
would
have
had
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
he
would
not
have
been
barred
by
the
longshoremen's
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
a
while
ago
you
said
that
this
had
been
a
third
party
and
not
a
stevedore
employer
that
was
operating
the
ship.
there
wouldn't
be
this
longshoreman
at
bar,
would
you
say
that
the
if
the
seaman
--
if
the
longshoreman
hadn't
died
and
it
had
been
a
third
party
operating
the
ship
he
could
have
had
a
maritime
cause
of
action
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
if
he
is
dead
--
that
if
he
has
died
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
has
said
that
you
can
borrow
that
louisiana
law,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
case
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
court
didn't
dispose
of
the
case
on
this
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
state
court
didn't
dispose
the
case
on
this
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
rule
against
you
on
this
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
pleadings
point?
there
would
have
been
merit?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
--
justice
byron

white
the
longshoremen's
case?
justice
byron

is
there
any

in

he
would

for
ordinary

justice

what
if
--
if
the
owner
of
the

here
had
not
been
the
stevedore,
let's
assume
it
is
an
ordinary

it
wasn't
a

also.
and
then
a

is
injured
on

he
had
a
