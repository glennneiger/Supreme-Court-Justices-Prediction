mr.
neal
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
a
few
factual
considerations
concerning
the
situation
here
before
going
into
the
main
question
before
court
namely
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
this
dispute.
i
would
like
to
say
also
that
if
the
court
goes
passed
the
norris-laguardia
act.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
rules
contrary
to
our
position
on
norris-laguardia
there
are
other
legal
issues
which
the
court
would
then
necessarily
be
based
with
one
of
course
being
in
the
basic
legality
of
the
conduct
here
and
secondly
the
--
which
is
been
briefed
by
the
both
parties
and
secondly
another
jurisdictional
defect
which
we
claim
to
with
that
this
conduct
is
at
least
arguably
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
therefore
must
be
presented
to
the
national
labor
relations
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
it's
constitutional
and
the
clayton
act
and
norris-laguardia
statutory
both.
the
green
block
on
this
map
here
starting
here
and
running
down
to
here
an
area
which
was
described
in
the
record
that
having
a
perimeter
of
about
one
and
a
half
to
two
miles
is
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
we
say
it
is
the
house
in
which
the
fec
does
business.
this
is
not
we
submit
respectfully
a
unique
situation
at
all.
the
situation
that
comes
up
and
has
been
presented
before
this
court
time
and
time
again
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
far
broader
area
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
defies
to,
this
is
a
simply
common
situs
situation.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
i'm
--
my
information
is
to
the
contrary
as
i
understand
the
pattern
of
industry-wide
bargaining
in
the
railroad
industry
did
not
develop
until
the
1930's.
it
happened
during
the
30's,
during
the
depression
when
the
railroads
asked
the
unions
to
cut
back
on
wages,
to
cut
wages
down.
and
in
regard
to
that,
this
pattern
of
area
or
industry-wide,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
industry-wide
completely
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
but
there
is
regional
bargaining
and
that
is
a
pattern
that
has
developed
but
subsequent
the
passage
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
1926,
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
1932
and
the
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act
in
1934.
so,
this
pattern
of
industry-wide
bargaining
was
not
an
established
pattern
when
these
statutes
were
passed
by
congress
and
congress
we
respectfully
submit
did
not
pass
these
acts
with
that
idea
in
mind.
now,
it
is
true
that
congress
recognized
as
we
submit
is
very
obvious
that
an
interruption
of
commerce
on
any
class
one
railroad
is
going
to
have
effects
on
other
class
one
railroads.
this
court
in
the
case
of
california
v.
taylor
which
concerned
a
state
owned
by
california
terminal
company
and
the
california
state
law
absolutely
forbid
the
employees
of
that
state
owned
railroad
as
state
employees
to
strike
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
railway
labor
act
applied
to
that
terminal
company.
and
this
court
held
that
it
did
that
the
federal
law
superseded
the
state
law
even
thought
the
federal
law
guaranteed
in
certain
circumstances
the
right
to
self
help
and
to
take
strike
action.
and
mr.
justice
minton
in
the
course
of
that
opinion
expressly
stated
that
it
--
that
it's
obvious
and
the
congress
knew
it
and
that
this
court
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
when
a
terminal
company
is
faced
with
a
strike
or
when
it's
involved
in
a
strike
it's
going
to
have
area-wide
effects.
now,
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
this
particular
kind
of
situation
has
not
been
before
the
court
in
a
railroad
context
before
is
eloquent
testimony
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
railway
labor
act.
this
is
the
longest
strike,
this
is
the
first
rail
major
breakdown
since
1926
in
the
functioning
to
the
railway
labor
act.
you
had
a
strike
in
the
rln
that
ran
for
about
60-70
days
after
that
sort
you
had
the
toledo
case
back
during
the
war,
that
also
with
the
primarily
a
terminal
type
railroad
that
ran
for
quite
of
period
of
time.
but
with
those
very
rare
exceptions,
the
railway
labor
act
has
worked
and
it
has
worked
effectively.
now,
the
problem
that
we're
faced
here
is
where
for
one
reason
or
another,
parties
are
totally
unable
to
get
together.
now,
we
submit
as
the
record
shows
that
breakdown
in
collective
bargaining
here
lies
on
negative
side.
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
irrelevant.
we've
offered
arbitrate,
the
railroad
refused
to
arbitrate.
we've
offered
to
mediate
even
though
the
strike
is
already
gone
on
to
continue
mediation.
mr.
neal
rutledge
we're
talking
about
our
dispute
with
the
fec
and
we
say
that
this
case
is
clearly
and
undeniably
arises
out
of
that
major
dispute.
and
that
it
involves
it
and
it
arises
out
of
it.
the
fec
when
before
going
into
this,
i
would
like
to
make
extremely
clear
that
this
is
not
the
same
strike
that
was
before
this
court
last
spring
in
the
clerk's
case.
that
was
the
non-operating
union
strike
that
is
going
on
since
1963
and
is
still
going
on.
this
is
the
operating
brotherhoods,
non-operating
people
of
course
referred
to
clerk's
like
for
these
people
that
worked
in
the
railroad
industry
but
don't
actually
operate
trains,
the
operating
crafts
or
people
like
engineers
and
trainmen
and
switchmen
who
actually
run
the
train.
and
the
operating
strike
did
not
begin
until
april
24.
the
reason
it
began
at
that
time
was
because
that
was
the
30-day-period
after
the
national
mediation
board
released
the
parties
to
self
help
and
the
fec
as
of
midnight,
april
24th
implemented
on
a
wholesale
basis,
it's
section
6
proposals
and
actually
the
brotherhoods
here
involved
took
strike
action
in
response.
however,
going
to
facts
two,
and
i
think
this
is
background
material
which
is
very
irrelevant
to
the
situation
before
the
court.
going
back
to
1963
when
the
none
of
strikes
first
began,
what
happened
was
the
fec
shutdown
completely
as
the
airlines
did
this
summer
during
the
machinist
strike.
they
didn't
try
to
operate
for
period
of
days.
and
they
pursuant
to
the
association
of
american
railroad
rules
and
that
have
been
adopted
by
interstate
commerce
commission
apparently
the
fec
embargo
all
the
traffic
with
its
connecting
carriers
and
we're
not
going
to
take
it,
we're
not
going
to
send
it,
we're
not
going
to
take
it.
we've
--
we
have
an
embargo
because
we
have
labor
trouble.
and
as
a
result
all
traffic
stopped
here
at
the
beginning
of
the
premises
and
there
was
no
question
at
that
point
of
any
picketing,
spreading
around
the
green
area,
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
the
fec
then
apparently
made
its
determination
that
it
was
going
to
commence
operations
despite
the
strike
and
it
went
into
court
and
brought
a
lawsuit
against
the
terminal
company
and
the
other
connecting
carriers
and
stated
the
analogy
i
thought
was
very
apt.
they
said,
where
fec
said,
we're
like
a
bachelor
in
an
apartment
shared
by
five
bachelors
and
we're
sick
and
they
are
trying
to
throw
us
out
because
we're
sick
and
we
don't
--
we
think
we
have
the
right
to
a
court
and
a
right
to
remain
here
so
that
we
can
get
well.
what
they
wanted
was
safe
harbor.
they
wanted
to
use
of
this
terminal
free
from
the
effects
of
the
primary
picketing.
they
did
not
make
the
unions
party
that
proceeding.
the
unions
tried
to
intervene
later,
they
refuse
intervention.
the
result
of
that
proceeding
which
is
still
at
this
very
time
still
at
the
temporary
injunction
sanction
is
that
the
court
order
the
terminal
company
of
these
other
carriers
to
provide
various
services
to
the
fec,
to
provide
direct
labor
services
to
the
fec,
to
interchange
cars
with
the
fec,
to
make
deliveries
to
the
fec,
to
take
deliveries
from
the
fec.
in
short,
this
was
the
place
where
the
fec
not
only
did
business
with
the
public
this
is
the
place
where
the
fec
does
business
with
its
connecting
carrier
by
contract
that
it
setup,
it
obligated
itself
to
do
business
that
these
other
carriers
at
this
place
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
true
your
honor.
every
time
two
railroads
buck
up
against
each
other,
they're
going
to
be
doing
business
with
each
other.
now,
we
say
that
this
is
the
same
thing
as
in
industrial
situation
where
deliveries
are
made
to
the
industrial
plant.
in
other
words,
there's
always
--
there
is
a
nexus,
there
has
to
be
a
place
where
one
person
does
business
with
another
person.
if
you
don't
do
business
in
the
vacuum
and
it
is
that
place
which
traditionally
going
back
for
hundreds
of
years
ever
since
labor
organizations
have
been
operating
that
unions
have
addressed
their
appeal.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
--
that's
correct.
now,
it
so
happens
in
the
fec
situation
that
there
are.
mr.
neal
rutledge
many
other
connecting
points.
there
are
some
connecting
points
down
at
the
south
end
but
and
there's
one
immense
injunction
about
a
third
to
the
way
down
the
line
but
this
is
the
--
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
there
are
other
places
and
those
other
places,
there
is
picketing
going
on
except
for
it's
been
joined.
there's
been
other
injunction
set
of
course.
but
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
you
see
the
distinction,
the
argument
has
been
made,
district
court,
court
of
appeal
and
here
this
morning
that
our
theory
is
that
we
can
picket
anywhere
in
fec
cars.
well,
now
of
course
that's
what
eugene
debbs
purported
said
that
he
had
the
right
to
do
in
the
pullman
strike
way
back
in
1894.
that
is
not
involved
here.
we
make
no
claim
to
that.
that's
not
--
that's
far
beyond
anything
that
we
claim
here.
we
claim
only
the
right
to
picket
where
the
fec
itself
is
operating
with
fec
crews,
with
fec
employees,
where
the
fec
is
itself
conducting
its
operations.
now,
of
course
there
is
a
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
precisely.
mr.
neal
rutledge
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
petitioner
has
told
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
brief
at
page
21
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
talking
about
the
wagshall
case
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comment
about
the
secondary
board
cutting
involved
there.
this
is
what
they've
said
to
distinguish
the
wagshall
case.
the
reasoning
does
not
apply
here
because
appellees
do
not
alleged
secondary
boycott.
in
other
words,
they
told
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
no
secondary
boycotting
here
and
that's
what
we
say.
we
say
that
this
is
traditional
primary
picketing
because
the
fec,
i
would
like
to
very
respectfully
differ
with
my
brother
when
he
said
that
the
fec
does
not
operate
its
trains
through
the
terminal.
as
i
understood
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
counsel
he
said,
the
fec
came
up
to
here
then
the
terminal
company
took
the
fec
cars.
the
record
conclusively
shows
the
fec
trains
daily
come
in
and
run
all
the
way
through
here
and
up
into
here
on
a
daily
regular
basis
and
under
that
injunction,
entered
back
in
1963
the
terminal
company
employees
must
throw
switches
for
those
train
movements.
they
must
maintain
tracks
to
those
train
movements.
they
must
give
signals
for
those
train
movements.
in
other
words,
the
terminal
company
people
are
operating
the
terminal
premises
here
as
an
adjunct,
as
an
indispensable
integrated
part
and
inseparable
part
of
the
fec
system.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
the
record
does
not
indicate
that.the
fec
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
--
the
record
indicates
only
this,
that
the
manager
of
the
terminal
company
in
three
years
never
saw
anybody
used
that
gate.
they're
none
speculative
foryear
and
a
half
for
so
and
nobody
uses
that
gate,
it's
like
picketing
the
blind
alley.
there's
no
useful
as
completely
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear.
the
--
the
fec,
these
men,
the
fec
employees
that
are
far
more
here
by
--
to
the
great
extent
to
come
on
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
on
train.
yes
--
yes,
sir.
they
are
train
crews.
mr.
neal
rutledge
no.
the
--
there
are
some
employees
that
do,
there
is
one
crew
per
day
that
does
report
toward
jacksonville
terminal
company
and
that's
the
crew
that
runs
the
passenger
train
but
that
crew
where
they
come
in
is
not
shown
by
the
record
because
nobody
as
the
--
mr.
jeanette
the
manager
of
the
terminal
company
when
they
asked
him
where
are
those
people
come
in,
those
are
the
only
fec
employee
that
come
in
by
foot
and
he
said,
“well,
as
you
can
see
there
are
a
lot
of
entrances
to
the
terminal
company.”
in
other
words,
that
reserve
gate,
we
submit
is
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
record
shows
that
the
--
that
under
the
contract
that
the
fec
has
with
the
terminal
company
and
other
railroads,
the
fec
has
a
right
to
use
in
common
with
all
the
other
railroads
every
facility
and
every
office
and
every
part
of
the
terminal
company.
now,
this
is
where
the
public
comes
on
to
buy
tickets
to
ride
the
fec
train.
this
is
--
they
--
this
is
a
common
office
building,
it's
like
a
place
where
poor
people
who
get
together
and
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes.
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
the
--
the
switching
is
done
to
certain
extent
by
automatic
towers
and
the
tower
operators,
they're
scattered
throughout
the
terminal
--
our
terminal
company
employees.
however,
it's
significant
that
during
this
13-hour
period.
the
people
that
man
those
towers
were
fec
supervisors.
they're
at
least
in
park.
they
were
supervisors
from
the
fec
and
from
acl
and
seaboard.
mr.
neal
rutledge
not
a
great
volume
now.
pre-strike
or
pre-1963
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
and
terminate.
mr.
neal
rutledge
now,
the
trade
business
here
is
the
largest
aspect
to
the
fec
business
here.
in
other
words,
30%
of
all
interchange
done
in
this
green
area
is
done
with
fec.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
the
fec
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
that.
the
--
the
fec
has
a
yard
down
here
called
(inaudible).
the
fec
puts
as
its
cars
down
there
and
it
puts
its
engine
up
to
its
cars
and
with
fec
crews
comes
on
in
here.
now,
if
it's
going
to
interchange
the
seaboard
or
with
southern
if
runs
on
in
to
these
yards
here,
honeymoon
and
wide
inside
the
green
area.
mr.
neal
rutledge
and
the
fec
crews
go
on
in
there
and
they
make
interchange
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
--
in
that
point.
that's
where
the
fec
crews
meet
face
to
face
with
the
seaboard
and
the
southern
crews.
if
the
case
of
the
acl,
the
fec
crews
come
up
embargo
with
their
cars
on
their
engines
and
they
run
that
train
all
the
way
on
up
in
here,
operate
back
and
forth
and
switch
and
cut
powers
and
do
regular
railroad
movements
up
here
and
then
come
on
all
the
way
back
on.
so,
that
the
northern
terminals
of
the
fec
railroad
in
a
very
real
sense
is
upon
green
yard
up
here.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
they
may
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
they
may
do
that
also.
first
of
all,
they
may
do
that
very
differently
in
the
garment
industry.
the
garment
industry
has
special
rules
that
congress
has
made
for
it
under
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no.
but
--
but
for
i
mean,
the
answer
to
your
question
depends
upon
what
industry
we're
in
and
the
garment
industry
there's
no
question
they
can
completely
surround
the
man
that
for
delivery
is
being
made.
mr.
neal
rutledge
exactly.
mr.
neal
rutledge
very
--
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
exactly
what
this
argument
is
about.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
there's
a
particularized
statute
for
the
garment
industry
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
the
statute
makes
an
exception
from
the
laws
that
existed
before
and
then
the
garment
industry
is
an
exception
to
the
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
but
--
but
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
is
that
congress
has
ever
since
1914
the
clayton
act
in
1914
and
again
in
1926
and
again
in
1932
and
again
in
1934
and
then
again
in
1935
when
the
wagner
act
was
passed
and
again
in
1947
when
(inaudible)
was
passed
and
again
in
1959
when
the
landrum-griffin
act
was
passed
congress
that
has
been
dealing
with
this
problem
has
never
used
the
word
“secondary
boycott”
in
the
statute.
never.
the
reason
is
because
it
is
so
imprecisely
one
of
the
chief
draftsmen
of
the
clayton
act
was
john
w.
davis
and
the
chief
draftsman
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
justice
frankfurter.
he
was
the
man
of
tremendous
legal
draftsman
skills
and
they
shied
away,
it's
the
courts
that
have
used
the
term
“secondary
boycott”
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
term
“secondary
boycott”
is
so
vague
because
all
picketing
has
secondary
aspects.
there
is
an
even
the
most
limited
kind
of
picketing
has
an
effect
on
somebody
else
on
a
neutral.
and
so,
where
you
draw
that
line
and
you
can
draw
it
in
at
least
50
different
places
and
we
say
that
that
is
a
legislative
determination
and
that
congress
in
this
case
has
drawn
that
line
and
has
not
drawn
it
anywhere
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
what?
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
have
more
of
a
problem
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
we
have
a
fatal
problem.
mr.
neal
rutledge
i
don't
think
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
on
our
position
is
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
prohibit
that.
but
that's
not
this
case
because
here
we
have
primary
picketing
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
it
may
--
it
maybe
--
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
not
that
this
is
not
this
case
because
this
is
picketing
which
is
addressed
to
people
approaching
the
place
where
the
fec
regulate
and
daily
does
business.
and
this
is
the
only
place
for
that
appeal
could
be
make,
if
the
district
court
injunction
stands
no
appeal
can
be
made
in
the
fec
crews
coming
on
the
premises
here.
mr.
neal
rutledge
it
--
it's
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
they
come
in
over
this
bridge,
they
come
in
a
variety
of
tracks.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
we
submit
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
first
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
first
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
we're
limited
in
picketing
this
point
right
here.
that's
the
only
place
that
we
can
picket
down
here
under
that
injunction.
the
second
answer
to
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
it's
an
entrance
to
the
terminal.
it's
as
much
an
entrance
to
the
terminal
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
that
would
not
--
our
position
isn't
that
that's
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
submit
your
honor
the
answer
to
that
question
is
the
primary
picketing
is
not
limited
by
definition
by
definition
that
this
court
has
made
to
appeal
just
to
employees
of
the
primary
employer.
we
are
making
appeals
here
to
people
who
are
making
deliveries
to
the
primary
employer
and
the
only
place
we
can
make
that
appeal
is
put
the
pickets
for
where
we
have.
the
only
place
we
can
appeal
is
the
acl
employee
not
to
make
deliveries
to
the
fec
is
here.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes.
your
honor.
yes.
this
is
where
--
this
is
where
the
fec
is
regulating
argue.
now,
i
would
like
to
move
on
into
the
question
of
the
application
of
norris-laguardia
to
this
conduct
whether
you
call
it
secondary
or
primary.
we
submit
that
the
history
which
is
familiar
to
this
court
certainly
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
norris-laguardia
shows
very
clearly
that
norris-laguardia
was
very
deliberately
designed
to
apply
to
situations
which
would
be
called
secondary
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
definitions.
the
--
the
clayton
act
of
course
was
passed
in
1914,
section
20
of
that
purported
to
make
lawful
that
is
to
make
not
in
violation
of
any
law
of
united
states
certain
described
kinds
of
consorted
conduct
and
the
clayton
act
at
that
time
was
passed
in
the
setting
of
three
railroad
labor
cases
which
involve
interchange
such
as
this,
there
was
the
earliest
case
was
a
circuit
court
case
decided
by
circuit
judge
taff,
later
chief
justice
in
the
toledo
case
and
back
in
19
--
1893
in
which
he
require
employees
about
connecting
carrier
to
make
interchange
with
these
struck
carrier
and
of
course
there
was
the
debts
injunction
in
1894
affirmed
in
1895
where
there
was
clearly
secondary
boycott
and
that
mr.
davis
at
the
chicago
terminal
was
trying
to
like
consorted
action
stopped
trains
that
had
pullman
cars
in
it
that
were
simply
pulling
pullman
cars,
remote
from
the
scene
of
the
actual
primary
dispute
and
there
was
the
ex
parte
lennon
case
cited
by
the
parties,
cited
in
1897
where
an
engineer
was
held
and
contempt
in
jail
for
violating
an
injunction
compelling
a
connecting
carrier
with
a
struck
carrier
to
interchange
cars.
and
the
clayton
act
was
passed
in
the
back
of
those
cases
and
said
out
described
type
of
consorted
activity
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
described
it
added
the
catch
all
phrase
that
those
consorted
activities
would
not
be
a
violation
of
any
law
of
united
states.
those
earlier
cases
the
debbs
and
the
lennon
and
the
toledo
case
were
all
decided
on
the
basis
that
the
conduct
enjoin
there
was
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
the
mail
statute
or
of
the
sherman
act.
and
the
clayton
act
of
course
by
that
catch
all
phrase
remove
the
basis
of
those
decisions.
the
--
what
happened
after
that
of
course
is
familiar
in
the
duplex
case.
you
had
clearly
secondary
type
activity,
you
had
a
manufacturer
at
michigan
making
printing
press
and
you
had
picketing
in
new
york
against
people
who
had
bought
those
printing
press
we're
using
in
the
clearest
type
of
secondary
activity
under
a
before
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
covered
by
the
clayton
act
that
could
be
enjoin
as
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
dissenters
justice
brandeis,
justice
holmes,
justice
clark
held
that
this
was
a
misreading
of
the
clayton
act,
a
misconstruction
of
it
and
of
course
in
1932
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
we
submit
that
congress
that
adopted
the
views
of
the
dissenters
in
the
duplex
case
as
this
court
as
itself
so
ruled
in
case
of
the
milkwagon
drivers
case
versus
lake
farm
cited
in
our
brief
and
united
states
the
hudson
case.
now,
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
on
this
point
is
unusually
clear
because
as
described
by
senator
norris
in
his
book.
the
act,
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
an
off
spring
of
the
old
ships
that
act
and
the
outside
help
was
called
in
and
the
--
of
course
the
book,
the
written
by
justice
frankfurter
and
professor
green,
the
labor
injunction
that
was
published
in
1932
and
was
backgrounds
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
it
has
in
the
appendix
of
that
book
is
that
draft
to
the
bill
not
as
finally
passed
but
substantially
as
finally
passed
in
--
there's
a
considerable
discussion
of
it
and
in
that
book,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
commentary
at
that
time
when
the
act
was
being
formed
that
they
contemplated
secondary
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
apply
to
secondary
activity.
the
--justice
frankfurter
refers
to
the
line
of
new
york
decision
which
referred
to
a
unity
of
interest
and
he
discusses
a
great
length
in
the
book
where
you
draw
the
line
and
where
that
act,
it
was
the
line
was
within
the
same
industry
that
if
you
were
within
the
same
industry
that
neutrals
made
the
appeal
to
the
new
york
line
of
cases
is
described
in
that
book
as
follows
and
i
just
like
read
one
sentence
from
it,
in
new
york
if
justification
for
economic
pressure
has
found
legal
recognitions
a
strike
or
a
threat
to
strike
maybe
brought
to
bear
upon
neutrals
provided
that
the
neutrals
does
use
is
a
lever
are
with
in
the
same
industry
as
goes
and
who's
coercion
is
union
is
primarily
interest
and
it
was
that
new
york
rule
which
is
referred
is
being
embodies
with
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
we
submit
that
the
definitional
of
the
literal
application
is
chief
judge
toddles
stated
in
his
opinion
below
if
you
look
just
to
the
language
of
norris-laguardia
it
applies
to
this
situation
and
clearly
applies
regardless
of
whether
you
call
this
common
side
is
picketing
primary
or
secondary.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
move
on
under
that
of
this
court
of
course
has
held
that
the
later
passed
railway
labor
act
in
the
sense
that
it
was
extensively
amended
in
1934.
thus,
must
be
accommodated
as
a
fellow
or
a
companion
labor
statute
with
the
norris-laguardia
act
where
the
need
is
obviously
apparent
where
it
is
a
need
that
cannot
be
denied
because
if
you
applied
norris-laguardia
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
could
not
be
operative.
now,
there
are
two
places,
two
situations
where
that
occur;
one
of
course
is
the
minor
dispute
situation.
if
you
have
compulsory
arbitration
of
minor
disputes
obviously
that
would
be
totally
frustration
if
you
also
permitted
strikes
over
minor
disputes.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
square
opposition
there.
that
is
one
place,
the
other
place
is
where
you
have
a
major
dispute
that
hasn't
been
refined
through
the
mandatory
procedures
of
the
act
where
you
attempt
to
exert
economic
pressure
without
going
through
bargaining
and
mediation
and
the
tender
anyway
of
voluntary
arbitration.
in
those
two
instance,
in
those
two
instance
only
we
submit
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
for
which
have
worked
so
successfully
would
be
totally
frustrated
unless
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
were
eliminated
in
those
specific
situations.
but
we
have
here
of
course
the
major
dispute
which
has
gone
through
the
procedures,
there
is
no
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
has
been
pointed
to
in
any
stage
of
this
litigation
that
we
have
been
in
violation
of
it
that
the
picket
words
have
been
in
violation.
now,
they
say
they
that
we
should
observe
section
6
notes
on
the
terminal
company
but
we
don't
represent
the
terminal
company
employees.
the
brt
does
represent
some
terminal
company
employees
but
conductors
don't
and
the
firemen
don't
and
not
only
that
the
employees
for
instance
who
moved
these
switches
for
fec
train
movement
were
not
represented
by
brt.
we
can
serve
section
6
notice
so
that
the
idea
that
there
are
procedures
here
which
are
open
to
us
which
have
not
been
exhausted
we
submit
is
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
again
our
dispute,
our
major
dispute
of
course
with
the
fec
you
can
say
that
we
have
a
dispute
with
the
terminal
company
in
the
sense
that
terminal
company
employees
are
performing
day
to
day
labor
services
for
the
benefit
of
the
fec.
we
are
appealing
to
those
employs
not
to
do
that
but
that's
a
collateral
dispute
that
arises
out
obvious
if
the
major
dispute
with
the
fec.
but
for
the
major
dispute
with
the
fec
this
entire
problem
would
not
leave
before
the
court.
the
suggestion
which
perhaps
to
be
derive
from
the
part
of
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
referred
to
the
colliquy
between
congressman
laguardia
and
another
congressman
about
the
railway
labor
act.
we
submit
is
not
decisive
here
in
any
sense
this
court
of
course
has
twice
squarely
held
the
norris-laguardia
act
applicable
in
a
railroad
situation
where
all
of
the
procedures
of
the
act
had
been
exhausted.
one
of
course
was
the
lega
first
case
in
1960
against
the
chicago
in
northwestern
railroad
company.
the
other
case
was
the
earlier
1944
case
trainmen
against
the
toledo
and
the
diorio
railroad
and
of
course
there
was
during
the
course
of
norris-laguardia
a
specific
amendment
submitted
to
congress
specifically
exempting
the
railway
industry
from
norris-laguardia.
this
was
voted
down
and
was
voted
down.
now,
in
summary
we
submit
first
of
all
that
on
a
factual
basis
this
is
in
the
tradition
and
history
of
the
labor
movement
primary
conduct
at
the
very
most
it
is
common
situs
which
may
or
may
not
be
called
secondary
depending
on
where
you
should
draw
the
secondary
line
that
this
is
the
very
type
of
conduct
which
norris-laguardia
does
cover
was
designed
to
cover.
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
milkwagon
driver's
case
and
the
hudson
case,
in
the
wagshow
case
and
marinecooks
and
stewards
repeatedly
situations
each
of
those
involving
what
would
be
called
secondary
activity
under
it
before
today,
milkwagon,
hudson,
wagshow
and
marinecooks
each
involving
secondary
activity,
each
norris-laguardia
being
applied.
and
finally,
we
say
that
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
requirement
in
the
railway
labor
act
itself,
search
the
man
which
even
suggests
that
there
must
be
in
accommodation
between
these
two
labor
statutes.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
neal
rutledge
precisely.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
what
we
call
the
degree
of
oral
argument,
the
argument
that
we're
going
to
go
up
to
atlanta
or
going
to
go
to
chicago
and
go
up
here
and
shutdown
terminals
all
over
the
country
because
there
are
fec
cars
went
through
that.
now,
that
would
be
conduct
which
i
would
suppose
under
anybody's
definition
would
be
secondary
conduct.
and
whether
that
would
be
so
close
whether
the
unity
of
interest
there
would
be
so
close
is
an
entirely
different
far
weaker
case
from
our
stand
point.
mr.
neal
rutledge
not
necessarily
particularly
if
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
of
norris-laguardia
is
adopted
namely
that
the
--
there
must
be
a
unity
of
interest
even
perhaps
more
close
and
more
direct
than
total
industry
wide.
now,
we
would
--
that
is
an
entirely
different
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
would
be
the
relevance
as
i
understand
it
of
chief
judge
tuttle's
discussion
of
the
fact
that
the
seaboard
and
the
acl
are
in
competition
with
the
fec.
the
majority
opinion
below
went
into
discussion
at
some
length
and
as
i
understand
that
it
was
showing
that
unity
of
interest
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
--
we
say
that
that
is
a
significant
fact
your
honor
because
that
shows
that
this
is
a
regular
place
of
operation
for
the
fec.
in
other
words,
if
it
was
merely
fec
cars
on
a
lease
basis
it
would
then
have
by
analogy
of
landlord-tenant
situation,
you
have
a
situation,
you
had
at
hudson
where
the
union
picketed
the
lessee
of
the
primary
party
which
is
we
say
more
remote
than
what
we
have
here
where
the
primary
party
is
actually
doing
business
with
its
own
employee.
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
your
honor
we've
been
trying
to
get
into
that
litigation,
our
position
is
this,
we
petition
to
intervene
before
all
these
occurred.
we
--
our
petition
was
denied
that's
on
appeal.
we
then
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
in
the
district
court
asking
for
a
construction
of
that
injunction
specifically
as
to
whether
we
would
be
deemed
and
contempt
to
that
injunction
if
we
both
picket
that
and
the
fec
on
the
record
in
that
case
came
in
and
said
in
the
declaratory
decree
case
said,
we
don't
construe
that
injunction
that
we
obtained
back
in
1953
as
having
anything
to
do
with
picketing.
it
doesn't
ban
picketing.
all
it
does
is
require
an
employee
of
the
terminal
company
if
he
does
come
to
work
to
perform
services
for
the
fec
but
it
doesn't
say
that
he
got
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no,
we
would
not
your
honor
and
the
facts
in
this
case
show
we
submit
and
of
course
this
can
be
developed
much
more
clearly
on
a
more
extensive
theory.
the
acl
mainline
runs
here
and
up
on
here.
we
did
not
stop
the
trains
on
that
mainline
there.
the
picket
here
is
to
a
little
drive
way
going
in
there
as
the
record
shows
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
--
trains
came
in
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
so
the
long
as
the
integrated
and
inseparable
that's
a
necessary
by
product
of
addressing
the
primary
pressure
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
very
clearly
it
can
be
done
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
we
submit
that
that
there
are
numerous
ways
that
the
operations
here
can
be
arranged
so
that
our
right
to
picket,
what
we
claim
are
right
to
be
to
picket
primary
employer
will
have
minimum
effect.
mr.
neal
rutledge
not
embargo
is
only
one
solution
which
we
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
--
we
want
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we
want
the
employees
of
the
connecting
carriers
not
to
make
deliveries
to
or
take
delivers
from
fec.
mr.
neal
rutledge
where
an
embargo
is
technically
i
would
understand
to
be
something
imposed
legally
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
requirement
by
commission
action.
now,
one
way
for
example
would
be
to
have
all
interchange
take
place
down
here,
down
in
(inaudible)
and
then
our
appeal
to
the
connecting
carriers
could
be
limited
to
one
spot
and
had
no
effect
on
the
lessee
if
you
had
interchange
taking
place
down
here.
we
can
then
appeal
to
seaboard
and
acl
employees
not
to
make
that
interchange
but
in
other
words,
there
are
numerous
ways
and
certainly
discussions
where
has
--
had
preliminary
had
during
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
we
went
to
personnel
managers
and
the
general
counsel
of
these
railroads
and
said
we
don't
want
to
hurt
you
and
we're
willing
to
work
in
any
way
we
can
to
minimize
the
effect
of
this
on
you
but
we
do
want
to
appeal
to
your
employees
not
to
make
deliveries
to
take
deliveries
from
or
perform
services
for
this
trucking
carrier.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
there's
a
very
significant
interest
for
us
to
limit
this
as
much
as
we
can
and
that
interest
is
our
own
self-interest
because
when
we
for
instance
put
picket
lines
around
the
entire
terminal
company
in
order
to
reach
the
fec
operation
this
puts
our
own
people
out
of
work
if
they
are
out
to
picket
lines.
i
mean,
they
put
our
brother
employees
out
of
work
and
we
have
a
very
material
interest
of
the
honoring
of
the
picket
line
hurts
the
laboring
man
as
much
as
it
hurts
the
employers.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
certainly
is
what
we're
doing
in
this
dispute
because
were
compel
to
by
the
integrated
operation
here
but
if
we
can
work
out
in
arrangement
where
it
won't
be
integrated
we
have
very
motive
of
self-interest
to
limit
as
much
as
we
can.
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
do
have
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
on
appeal.
mr.
neal
rutledge
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
tallahassee
and
it
was
also
before
this
court
on
a
probation
proceeding.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
it's
pending
before
this
court.
mr.
neal
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
a
few
factual
considerations
concerning
the
situation
here
before
going
into
the
main
question
before
court
namely
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
this
dispute.
i
would
like
to
say
also
that
if
the
court
goes
passed
the
norris-laguardia
act.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
rules
contrary
to
our
position
on
norris-laguardia
there
are
other
legal
issues
which
the
court
would
then
necessarily
be
based
with
one
of
course
being
in
the
basic
legality
of
the
conduct
here
and
secondly
the
--
which
is
been
briefed
by
the
both
parties
and
secondly
another
jurisdictional
defect
which
we
claim
to
with
that
this
conduct
is
at
least
arguably
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
therefore
must
be
presented
to
the
national
labor
relations
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
it's
constitutional
and
the
clayton
act
and
norris-laguardia
statutory
both.
the
green
block
on
this
map
here
starting
here
and
running
down
to
here
an
area
which
was
described
in
the
record
that
having
a
perimeter
of
about
one
and
a
half
to
two
miles
is
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
we
say
it
is
the
house
in
which
the
fec
does
business.
this
is
not
we
submit
respectfully
a
unique
situation
at
all.
the
situation
that
comes
up
and
has
been
presented
before
this
court
time
and
time
again
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
far
broader
area
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
defies
to,
this
is
a
simply
common
situs
situation.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
i'm
--
my
information
is
to
the
contrary
as
i
understand
the
pattern
of
industry-wide
bargaining
in
the
railroad
industry
did
not
develop
until
the
1930's.
it
happened
during
the
30's,
during
the
depression
when
the
railroads
asked
the
unions
to
cut
back
on
wages,
to
cut
wages
down.
and
in
regard
to
that,
this
pattern
of
area
or
industry-wide,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
industry-wide
completely
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
but
there
is
regional
bargaining
and
that
is
a
pattern
that
has
developed
but
subsequent
the
passage
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
1926,
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
1932
and
the
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act
in
1934.
so,
this
pattern
of
industry-wide
bargaining
was
not
an
established
pattern
when
these
statutes
were
passed
by
congress
and
congress
we
respectfully
submit
did
not
pass
these
acts
with
that
idea
in
mind.
now,
it
is
true
that
congress
recognized
as
we
submit
is
very
obvious
that
an
interruption
of
commerce
on
any
class
one
railroad
is
going
to
have
effects
on
other
class
one
railroads.
this
court
in
the
case
of
california
v.
taylor
which
concerned
a
state
owned
by
california
terminal
company
and
the
california
state
law
absolutely
forbid
the
employees
of
that
state
owned
railroad
as
state
employees
to
strike
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
railway
labor
act
applied
to
that
terminal
company.
and
this
court
held
that
it
did
that
the
federal
law
superseded
the
state
law
even
thought
the
federal
law
guaranteed
in
certain
circumstances
the
right
to
self
help
and
to
take
strike
action.
and
mr.
justice
minton
in
the
course
of
that
opinion
expressly
stated
that
it
--
that
it's
obvious
and
the
congress
knew
it
and
that
this
court
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
when
a
terminal
company
is
faced
with
a
strike
or
when
it's
involved
in
a
strike
it's
going
to
have
area-wide
effects.
now,
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
this
particular
kind
of
situation
has
not
been
before
the
court
in
a
railroad
context
before
is
eloquent
testimony
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
railway
labor
act.
this
is
the
longest
strike,
this
is
the
first
rail
major
breakdown
since
1926
in
the
functioning
to
the
railway
labor
act.
you
had
a
strike
in
the
rln
that
ran
for
about
60-70
days
after
that
sort
you
had
the
toledo
case
back
during
the
war,
that
also
with
the
primarily
a
terminal
type
railroad
that
ran
for
quite
of
period
of
time.
but
with
those
very
rare
exceptions,
the
railway
labor
act
has
worked
and
it
has
worked
effectively.
now,
the
problem
that
we're
faced
here
is
where
for
one
reason
or
another,
parties
are
totally
unable
to
get
together.
now,
we
submit
as
the
record
shows
that
breakdown
in
collective
bargaining
here
lies
on
negative
side.
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
irrelevant.
we've
offered
arbitrate,
the
railroad
refused
to
arbitrate.
we've
offered
to
mediate
even
though
the
strike
is
already
gone
on
to
continue
mediation.
mr.
neal
rutledge
we're
talking
about
our
dispute
with
the
fec
and
we
say
that
this
case
is
clearly
and
undeniably
arises
out
of
that
major
dispute.
and
that
it
involves
it
and
it
arises
out
of
it.
the
fec
when
before
going
into
this,
i
would
like
to
make
extremely
clear
that
this
is
not
the
same
strike
that
was
before
this
court
last
spring
in
the
clerk's
case.
that
was
the
non-operating
union
strike
that
is
going
on
since
1963
and
is
still
going
on.
this
is
the
operating
brotherhoods,
non-operating
people
of
course
referred
to
clerk's
like
for
these
people
that
worked
in
the
railroad
industry
but
don't
actually
operate
trains,
the
operating
crafts
or
people
like
engineers
and
trainmen
and
switchmen
who
actually
run
the
train.
and
the
operating
strike
did
not
begin
until
april
24.
the
reason
it
began
at
that
time
was
because
that
was
the
30-day-period
after
the
national
mediation
board
released
the
parties
to
self
help
and
the
fec
as
of
midnight,
april
24th
implemented
on
a
wholesale
basis,
it's
section
6
proposals
and
actually
the
brotherhoods
here
involved
took
strike
action
in
response.
however,
going
to
facts
two,
and
i
think
this
is
background
material
which
is
very
irrelevant
to
the
situation
before
the
court.
going
back
to
1963
when
the
none
of
strikes
first
began,
what
happened
was
the
fec
shutdown
completely
as
the
airlines
did
this
summer
during
the
machinist
strike.
they
didn't
try
to
operate
for
period
of
days.
and
they
pursuant
to
the
association
of
american
railroad
rules
and
that
have
been
adopted
by
interstate
commerce
commission
apparently
the
fec
embargo
all
the
traffic
with
its
connecting
carriers
and
we're
not
going
to
take
it,
we're
not
going
to
send
it,
we're
not
going
to
take
it.
we've
--
we
have
an
embargo
because
we
have
labor
trouble.
and
as
a
result
all
traffic
stopped
here
at
the
beginning
of
the
premises
and
there
was
no
question
at
that
point
of
any
picketing,
spreading
around
the
green
area,
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
the
fec
then
apparently
made
its
determination
that
it
was
going
to
commence
operations
despite
the
strike
and
it
went
into
court
and
brought
a
lawsuit
against
the
terminal
company
and
the
other
connecting
carriers
and
stated
the
analogy
i
thought
was
very
apt.
they
said,
where
fec
said,
we're
like
a
bachelor
in
an
apartment
shared
by
five
bachelors
and
we're
sick
and
they
are
trying
to
throw
us
out
because
we're
sick
and
we
don't
--
we
think
we
have
the
right
to
a
court
and
a
right
to
remain
here
so
that
we
can
get
well.
what
they
wanted
was
safe
harbor.
they
wanted
to
use
of
this
terminal
free
from
the
effects
of
the
primary
picketing.
they
did
not
make
the
unions
party
that
proceeding.
the
unions
tried
to
intervene
later,
they
refuse
intervention.
the
result
of
that
proceeding
which
is
still
at
this
very
time
still
at
the
temporary
injunction
sanction
is
that
the
court
order
the
terminal
company
of
these
other
carriers
to
provide
various
services
to
the
fec,
to
provide
direct
labor
services
to
the
fec,
to
interchange
cars
with
the
fec,
to
make
deliveries
to
the
fec,
to
take
deliveries
from
the
fec.
in
short,
this
was
the
place
where
the
fec
not
only
did
business
with
the
public
this
is
the
place
where
the
fec
does
business
with
its
connecting
carrier
by
contract
that
it
setup,
it
obligated
itself
to
do
business
that
these
other
carriers
at
this
place
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
true
your
honor.
every
time
two
railroads
buck
up
against
each
other,
they're
going
to
be
doing
business
with
each
other.
now,
we
say
that
this
is
the
same
thing
as
in
industrial
situation
where
deliveries
are
made
to
the
industrial
plant.
in
other
words,
there's
always
--
there
is
a
nexus,
there
has
to
be
a
place
where
one
person
does
business
with
another
person.
if
you
don't
do
business
in
the
vacuum
and
it
is
that
place
which
traditionally
going
back
for
hundreds
of
years
ever
since
labor
organizations
have
been
operating
that
unions
have
addressed
their
appeal.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
--
that's
correct.
now,
it
so
happens
in
the
fec
situation
that
there
are.
mr.
neal
rutledge
many
other
connecting
points.
there
are
some
connecting
points
down
at
the
south
end
but
and
there's
one
immense
injunction
about
a
third
to
the
way
down
the
line
but
this
is
the
--
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
there
are
other
places
and
those
other
places,
there
is
picketing
going
on
except
for
it's
been
joined.
there's
been
other
injunction
set
of
course.
but
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
you
see
the
distinction,
the
argument
has
been
made,
district
court,
court
of
appeal
and
here
this
morning
that
our
theory
is
that
we
can
picket
anywhere
in
fec
cars.
well,
now
of
course
that's
what
eugene
debbs
purported
said
that
he
had
the
right
to
do
in
the
pullman
strike
way
back
in
1894.
that
is
not
involved
here.
we
make
no
claim
to
that.
that's
not
--
that's
far
beyond
anything
that
we
claim
here.
we
claim
only
the
right
to
picket
where
the
fec
itself
is
operating
with
fec
crews,
with
fec
employees,
where
the
fec
is
itself
conducting
its
operations.
now,
of
course
there
is
a
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
precisely.
mr.
neal
rutledge
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
petitioner
has
told
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
brief
at
page
21
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
talking
about
the
wagshall
case
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comment
about
the
secondary
board
cutting
involved
there.
this
is
what
they've
said
to
distinguish
the
wagshall
case.
the
reasoning
does
not
apply
here
because
appellees
do
not
alleged
secondary
boycott.
in
other
words,
they
told
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
no
secondary
boycotting
here
and
that's
what
we
say.
we
say
that
this
is
traditional
primary
picketing
because
the
fec,
i
would
like
to
very
respectfully
differ
with
my
brother
when
he
said
that
the
fec
does
not
operate
its
trains
through
the
terminal.
as
i
understood
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
counsel
he
said,
the
fec
came
up
to
here
then
the
terminal
company
took
the
fec
cars.
the
record
conclusively
shows
the
fec
trains
daily
come
in
and
run
all
the
way
through
here
and
up
into
here
on
a
daily
regular
basis
and
under
that
injunction,
entered
back
in
1963
the
terminal
company
employees
must
throw
switches
for
those
train
movements.
they
must
maintain
tracks
to
those
train
movements.
they
must
give
signals
for
those
train
movements.
in
other
words,
the
terminal
company
people
are
operating
the
terminal
premises
here
as
an
adjunct,
as
an
indispensable
integrated
part
and
inseparable
part
of
the
fec
system.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
the
record
does
not
indicate
that.the
fec
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
--
the
record
indicates
only
this,
that
the
manager
of
the
terminal
company
in
three
years
never
saw
anybody
used
that
gate.
they're
none
speculative
foryear
and
a
half
for
so
and
nobody
uses
that
gate,
it's
like
picketing
the
blind
alley.
there's
no
useful
as
completely
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear.
the
--
the
fec,
these
men,
the
fec
employees
that
are
far
more
here
by
--
to
the
great
extent
to
come
on
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
on
train.
yes
--
yes,
sir.
they
are
train
crews.
mr.
neal
rutledge
no.
the
--
there
are
some
employees
that
do,
there
is
one
crew
per
day
that
does
report
toward
jacksonville
terminal
company
and
that's
the
crew
that
runs
the
passenger
train
but
that
crew
where
they
come
in
is
not
shown
by
the
record
because
nobody
as
the
--
mr.
jeanette
the
manager
of
the
terminal
company
when
they
asked
him
where
are
those
people
come
in,
those
are
the
only
fec
employee
that
come
in
by
foot
and
he
said,
“well,
as
you
can
see
there
are
a
lot
of
entrances
to
the
terminal
company.”
in
other
words,
that
reserve
gate,
we
submit
is
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
record
shows
that
the
--
that
under
the
contract
that
the
fec
has
with
the
terminal
company
and
other
railroads,
the
fec
has
a
right
to
use
in
common
with
all
the
other
railroads
every
facility
and
every
office
and
every
part
of
the
terminal
company.
now,
this
is
where
the
public
comes
on
to
buy
tickets
to
ride
the
fec
train.
this
is
--
they
--
this
is
a
common
office
building,
it's
like
a
place
where
poor
people
who
get
together
and
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes.
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
the
--
the
switching
is
done
to
certain
extent
by
automatic
towers
and
the
tower
operators,
they're
scattered
throughout
the
terminal
--
our
terminal
company
employees.
however,
it's
significant
that
during
this
13-hour
period.
the
people
that
man
those
towers
were
fec
supervisors.
they're
at
least
in
park.
they
were
supervisors
from
the
fec
and
from
acl
and
seaboard.
mr.
neal
rutledge
not
a
great
volume
now.
pre-strike
or
pre-1963
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
and
terminate.
mr.
neal
rutledge
now,
the
trade
business
here
is
the
largest
aspect
to
the
fec
business
here.
in
other
words,
30%
of
all
interchange
done
in
this
green
area
is
done
with
fec.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
the
fec
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
that.
the
--
the
fec
has
a
yard
down
here
called
(inaudible).
the
fec
puts
as
its
cars
down
there
and
it
puts
its
engine
up
to
its
cars
and
with
fec
crews
comes
on
in
here.
now,
if
it's
going
to
interchange
the
seaboard
or
with
southern
if
runs
on
in
to
these
yards
here,
honeymoon
and
wide
inside
the
green
area.
mr.
neal
rutledge
and
the
fec
crews
go
on
in
there
and
they
make
interchange
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
--
in
that
point.
that's
where
the
fec
crews
meet
face
to
face
with
the
seaboard
and
the
southern
crews.
if
the
case
of
the
acl,
the
fec
crews
come
up
embargo
with
their
cars
on
their
engines
and
they
run
that
train
all
the
way
on
up
in
here,
operate
back
and
forth
and
switch
and
cut
powers
and
do
regular
railroad
movements
up
here
and
then
come
on
all
the
way
back
on.
so,
that
the
northern
terminals
of
the
fec
railroad
in
a
very
real
sense
is
upon
green
yard
up
here.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
they
may
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
they
may
do
that
also.
first
of
all,
they
may
do
that
very
differently
in
the
garment
industry.
the
garment
industry
has
special
rules
that
congress
has
made
for
it
under
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no.
but
--
but
for
i
mean,
the
answer
to
your
question
depends
upon
what
industry
we're
in
and
the
garment
industry
there's
no
question
they
can
completely
surround
the
man
that
for
delivery
is
being
made.
mr.
neal
rutledge
exactly.
mr.
neal
rutledge
very
--
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
exactly
what
this
argument
is
about.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
there's
a
particularized
statute
for
the
garment
industry
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
the
statute
makes
an
exception
from
the
laws
that
existed
before
and
then
the
garment
industry
is
an
exception
to
the
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
but
--
but
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
is
that
congress
has
ever
since
1914
the
clayton
act
in
1914
and
again
in
1926
and
again
in
1932
and
again
in
1934
and
then
again
in
1935
when
the
wagner
act
was
passed
and
again
in
1947
when
(inaudible)
was
passed
and
again
in
1959
when
the
landrum-griffin
act
was
passed
congress
that
has
been
dealing
with
this
problem
has
never
used
the
word
“secondary
boycott”
in
the
statute.
never.
the
reason
is
because
it
is
so
imprecisely
one
of
the
chief
draftsmen
of
the
clayton
act
was
john
w.
davis
and
the
chief
draftsman
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
justice
frankfurter.
he
was
the
man
of
tremendous
legal
draftsman
skills
and
they
shied
away,
it's
the
courts
that
have
used
the
term
“secondary
boycott”
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
term
“secondary
boycott”
is
so
vague
because
all
picketing
has
secondary
aspects.
there
is
an
even
the
most
limited
kind
of
picketing
has
an
effect
on
somebody
else
on
a
neutral.
and
so,
where
you
draw
that
line
and
you
can
draw
it
in
at
least
50
different
places
and
we
say
that
that
is
a
legislative
determination
and
that
congress
in
this
case
has
drawn
that
line
and
has
not
drawn
it
anywhere
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
what?
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
have
more
of
a
problem
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
we
have
a
fatal
problem.
mr.
neal
rutledge
i
don't
think
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
on
our
position
is
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
prohibit
that.
but
that's
not
this
case
because
here
we
have
primary
picketing
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
it
may
--
it
maybe
--
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
not
that
this
is
not
this
case
because
this
is
picketing
which
is
addressed
to
people
approaching
the
place
where
the
fec
regulate
and
daily
does
business.
and
this
is
the
only
place
for
that
appeal
could
be
make,
if
the
district
court
injunction
stands
no
appeal
can
be
made
in
the
fec
crews
coming
on
the
premises
here.
mr.
neal
rutledge
it
--
it's
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
they
come
in
over
this
bridge,
they
come
in
a
variety
of
tracks.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
we
submit
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
first
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
the
first
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
we're
limited
in
picketing
this
point
right
here.
that's
the
only
place
that
we
can
picket
down
here
under
that
injunction.
the
second
answer
to
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
it's
an
entrance
to
the
terminal.
it's
as
much
an
entrance
to
the
terminal
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
that
would
not
--
our
position
isn't
that
that's
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
submit
your
honor
the
answer
to
that
question
is
the
primary
picketing
is
not
limited
by
definition
by
definition
that
this
court
has
made
to
appeal
just
to
employees
of
the
primary
employer.
we
are
making
appeals
here
to
people
who
are
making
deliveries
to
the
primary
employer
and
the
only
place
we
can
make
that
appeal
is
put
the
pickets
for
where
we
have.
the
only
place
we
can
appeal
is
the
acl
employee
not
to
make
deliveries
to
the
fec
is
here.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes.
your
honor.
yes.
this
is
where
--
this
is
where
the
fec
is
regulating
argue.
now,
i
would
like
to
move
on
into
the
question
of
the
application
of
norris-laguardia
to
this
conduct
whether
you
call
it
secondary
or
primary.
we
submit
that
the
history
which
is
familiar
to
this
court
certainly
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
norris-laguardia
shows
very
clearly
that
norris-laguardia
was
very
deliberately
designed
to
apply
to
situations
which
would
be
called
secondary
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
definitions.
the
--
the
clayton
act
of
course
was
passed
in
1914,
section
20
of
that
purported
to
make
lawful
that
is
to
make
not
in
violation
of
any
law
of
united
states
certain
described
kinds
of
consorted
conduct
and
the
clayton
act
at
that
time
was
passed
in
the
setting
of
three
railroad
labor
cases
which
involve
interchange
such
as
this,
there
was
the
earliest
case
was
a
circuit
court
case
decided
by
circuit
judge
taff,
later
chief
justice
in
the
toledo
case
and
back
in
19
--
1893
in
which
he
require
employees
about
connecting
carrier
to
make
interchange
with
these
struck
carrier
and
of
course
there
was
the
debts
injunction
in
1894
affirmed
in
1895
where
there
was
clearly
secondary
boycott
and
that
mr.
davis
at
the
chicago
terminal
was
trying
to
like
consorted
action
stopped
trains
that
had
pullman
cars
in
it
that
were
simply
pulling
pullman
cars,
remote
from
the
scene
of
the
actual
primary
dispute
and
there
was
the
ex
parte
lennon
case
cited
by
the
parties,
cited
in
1897
where
an
engineer
was
held
and
contempt
in
jail
for
violating
an
injunction
compelling
a
connecting
carrier
with
a
struck
carrier
to
interchange
cars.
and
the
clayton
act
was
passed
in
the
back
of
those
cases
and
said
out
described
type
of
consorted
activity
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
described
it
added
the
catch
all
phrase
that
those
consorted
activities
would
not
be
a
violation
of
any
law
of
united
states.
those
earlier
cases
the
debbs
and
the
lennon
and
the
toledo
case
were
all
decided
on
the
basis
that
the
conduct
enjoin
there
was
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
the
mail
statute
or
of
the
sherman
act.
and
the
clayton
act
of
course
by
that
catch
all
phrase
remove
the
basis
of
those
decisions.
the
--
what
happened
after
that
of
course
is
familiar
in
the
duplex
case.
you
had
clearly
secondary
type
activity,
you
had
a
manufacturer
at
michigan
making
printing
press
and
you
had
picketing
in
new
york
against
people
who
had
bought
those
printing
press
we're
using
in
the
clearest
type
of
secondary
activity
under
a
before
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
covered
by
the
clayton
act
that
could
be
enjoin
as
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
dissenters
justice
brandeis,
justice
holmes,
justice
clark
held
that
this
was
a
misreading
of
the
clayton
act,
a
misconstruction
of
it
and
of
course
in
1932
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
we
submit
that
congress
that
adopted
the
views
of
the
dissenters
in
the
duplex
case
as
this
court
as
itself
so
ruled
in
case
of
the
milkwagon
drivers
case
versus
lake
farm
cited
in
our
brief
and
united
states
the
hudson
case.
now,
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
on
this
point
is
unusually
clear
because
as
described
by
senator
norris
in
his
book.
the
act,
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
an
off
spring
of
the
old
ships
that
act
and
the
outside
help
was
called
in
and
the
--
of
course
the
book,
the
written
by
justice
frankfurter
and
professor
green,
the
labor
injunction
that
was
published
in
1932
and
was
backgrounds
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
it
has
in
the
appendix
of
that
book
is
that
draft
to
the
bill
not
as
finally
passed
but
substantially
as
finally
passed
in
--
there's
a
considerable
discussion
of
it
and
in
that
book,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
commentary
at
that
time
when
the
act
was
being
formed
that
they
contemplated
secondary
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
apply
to
secondary
activity.
the
--justice
frankfurter
refers
to
the
line
of
new
york
decision
which
referred
to
a
unity
of
interest
and
he
discusses
a
great
length
in
the
book
where
you
draw
the
line
and
where
that
act,
it
was
the
line
was
within
the
same
industry
that
if
you
were
within
the
same
industry
that
neutrals
made
the
appeal
to
the
new
york
line
of
cases
is
described
in
that
book
as
follows
and
i
just
like
read
one
sentence
from
it,
in
new
york
if
justification
for
economic
pressure
has
found
legal
recognitions
a
strike
or
a
threat
to
strike
maybe
brought
to
bear
upon
neutrals
provided
that
the
neutrals
does
use
is
a
lever
are
with
in
the
same
industry
as
goes
and
who's
coercion
is
union
is
primarily
interest
and
it
was
that
new
york
rule
which
is
referred
is
being
embodies
with
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
we
submit
that
the
definitional
of
the
literal
application
is
chief
judge
toddles
stated
in
his
opinion
below
if
you
look
just
to
the
language
of
norris-laguardia
it
applies
to
this
situation
and
clearly
applies
regardless
of
whether
you
call
this
common
side
is
picketing
primary
or
secondary.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
move
on
under
that
of
this
court
of
course
has
held
that
the
later
passed
railway
labor
act
in
the
sense
that
it
was
extensively
amended
in
1934.
thus,
must
be
accommodated
as
a
fellow
or
a
companion
labor
statute
with
the
norris-laguardia
act
where
the
need
is
obviously
apparent
where
it
is
a
need
that
cannot
be
denied
because
if
you
applied
norris-laguardia
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
could
not
be
operative.
now,
there
are
two
places,
two
situations
where
that
occur;
one
of
course
is
the
minor
dispute
situation.
if
you
have
compulsory
arbitration
of
minor
disputes
obviously
that
would
be
totally
frustration
if
you
also
permitted
strikes
over
minor
disputes.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
square
opposition
there.
that
is
one
place,
the
other
place
is
where
you
have
a
major
dispute
that
hasn't
been
refined
through
the
mandatory
procedures
of
the
act
where
you
attempt
to
exert
economic
pressure
without
going
through
bargaining
and
mediation
and
the
tender
anyway
of
voluntary
arbitration.
in
those
two
instance,
in
those
two
instance
only
we
submit
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
for
which
have
worked
so
successfully
would
be
totally
frustrated
unless
the
prohibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
were
eliminated
in
those
specific
situations.
but
we
have
here
of
course
the
major
dispute
which
has
gone
through
the
procedures,
there
is
no
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
has
been
pointed
to
in
any
stage
of
this
litigation
that
we
have
been
in
violation
of
it
that
the
picket
words
have
been
in
violation.
now,
they
say
they
that
we
should
observe
section
6
notes
on
the
terminal
company
but
we
don't
represent
the
terminal
company
employees.
the
brt
does
represent
some
terminal
company
employees
but
conductors
don't
and
the
firemen
don't
and
not
only
that
the
employees
for
instance
who
moved
these
switches
for
fec
train
movement
were
not
represented
by
brt.
we
can
serve
section
6
notice
so
that
the
idea
that
there
are
procedures
here
which
are
open
to
us
which
have
not
been
exhausted
we
submit
is
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
again
our
dispute,
our
major
dispute
of
course
with
the
fec
you
can
say
that
we
have
a
dispute
with
the
terminal
company
in
the
sense
that
terminal
company
employees
are
performing
day
to
day
labor
services
for
the
benefit
of
the
fec.
we
are
appealing
to
those
employs
not
to
do
that
but
that's
a
collateral
dispute
that
arises
out
obvious
if
the
major
dispute
with
the
fec.
but
for
the
major
dispute
with
the
fec
this
entire
problem
would
not
leave
before
the
court.
the
suggestion
which
perhaps
to
be
derive
from
the
part
of
the
legislative
history
of
norris-laguardia
referred
to
the
colliquy
between
congressman
laguardia
and
another
congressman
about
the
railway
labor
act.
we
submit
is
not
decisive
here
in
any
sense
this
court
of
course
has
twice
squarely
held
the
norris-laguardia
act
applicable
in
a
railroad
situation
where
all
of
the
procedures
of
the
act
had
been
exhausted.
one
of
course
was
the
lega
first
case
in
1960
against
the
chicago
in
northwestern
railroad
company.
the
other
case
was
the
earlier
1944
case
trainmen
against
the
toledo
and
the
diorio
railroad
and
of
course
there
was
during
the
course
of
norris-laguardia
a
specific
amendment
submitted
to
congress
specifically
exempting
the
railway
industry
from
norris-laguardia.
this
was
voted
down
and
was
voted
down.
now,
in
summary
we
submit
first
of
all
that
on
a
factual
basis
this
is
in
the
tradition
and
history
of
the
labor
movement
primary
conduct
at
the
very
most
it
is
common
situs
which
may
or
may
not
be
called
secondary
depending
on
where
you
should
draw
the
secondary
line
that
this
is
the
very
type
of
conduct
which
norris-laguardia
does
cover
was
designed
to
cover.
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
milkwagon
driver's
case
and
the
hudson
case,
in
the
wagshow
case
and
marinecooks
and
stewards
repeatedly
situations
each
of
those
involving
what
would
be
called
secondary
activity
under
it
before
today,
milkwagon,
hudson,
wagshow
and
marinecooks
each
involving
secondary
activity,
each
norris-laguardia
being
applied.
and
finally,
we
say
that
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
requirement
in
the
railway
labor
act
itself,
search
the
man
which
even
suggests
that
there
must
be
in
accommodation
between
these
two
labor
statutes.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
neal
rutledge
precisely.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
what
we
call
the
degree
of
oral
argument,
the
argument
that
we're
going
to
go
up
to
atlanta
or
going
to
go
to
chicago
and
go
up
here
and
shutdown
terminals
all
over
the
country
because
there
are
fec
cars
went
through
that.
now,
that
would
be
conduct
which
i
would
suppose
under
anybody's
definition
would
be
secondary
conduct.
and
whether
that
would
be
so
close
whether
the
unity
of
interest
there
would
be
so
close
is
an
entirely
different
far
weaker
case
from
our
stand
point.
mr.
neal
rutledge
not
necessarily
particularly
if
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
of
norris-laguardia
is
adopted
namely
that
the
--
there
must
be
a
unity
of
interest
even
perhaps
more
close
and
more
direct
than
total
industry
wide.
now,
we
would
--
that
is
an
entirely
different
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
would
be
the
relevance
as
i
understand
it
of
chief
judge
tuttle's
discussion
of
the
fact
that
the
seaboard
and
the
acl
are
in
competition
with
the
fec.
the
majority
opinion
below
went
into
discussion
at
some
length
and
as
i
understand
that
it
was
showing
that
unity
of
interest
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
--
we
say
that
that
is
a
significant
fact
your
honor
because
that
shows
that
this
is
a
regular
place
of
operation
for
the
fec.
in
other
words,
if
it
was
merely
fec
cars
on
a
lease
basis
it
would
then
have
by
analogy
of
landlord-tenant
situation,
you
have
a
situation,
you
had
at
hudson
where
the
union
picketed
the
lessee
of
the
primary
party
which
is
we
say
more
remote
than
what
we
have
here
where
the
primary
party
is
actually
doing
business
with
its
own
employee.
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
your
honor
we've
been
trying
to
get
into
that
litigation,
our
position
is
this,
we
petition
to
intervene
before
all
these
occurred.
we
--
our
petition
was
denied
that's
on
appeal.
we
then
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
in
the
district
court
asking
for
a
construction
of
that
injunction
specifically
as
to
whether
we
would
be
deemed
and
contempt
to
that
injunction
if
we
both
picket
that
and
the
fec
on
the
record
in
that
case
came
in
and
said
in
the
declaratory
decree
case
said,
we
don't
construe
that
injunction
that
we
obtained
back
in
1953
as
having
anything
to
do
with
picketing.
it
doesn't
ban
picketing.
all
it
does
is
require
an
employee
of
the
terminal
company
if
he
does
come
to
work
to
perform
services
for
the
fec
but
it
doesn't
say
that
he
got
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
no,
we
would
not
your
honor
and
the
facts
in
this
case
show
we
submit
and
of
course
this
can
be
developed
much
more
clearly
on
a
more
extensive
theory.
the
acl
mainline
runs
here
and
up
on
here.
we
did
not
stop
the
trains
on
that
mainline
there.
the
picket
here
is
to
a
little
drive
way
going
in
there
as
the
record
shows
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
--
trains
came
in
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
so
the
long
as
the
integrated
and
inseparable
that's
a
necessary
by
product
of
addressing
the
primary
pressure
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
very
clearly
it
can
be
done
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
well,
we
submit
that
that
there
are
numerous
ways
that
the
operations
here
can
be
arranged
so
that
our
right
to
picket,
what
we
claim
are
right
to
be
to
picket
primary
employer
will
have
minimum
effect.
mr.
neal
rutledge
not
embargo
is
only
one
solution
which
we
--
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
--
we
want
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we
want
the
employees
of
the
connecting
carriers
not
to
make
deliveries
to
or
take
delivers
from
fec.
mr.
neal
rutledge
where
an
embargo
is
technically
i
would
understand
to
be
something
imposed
legally
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
requirement
by
commission
action.
now,
one
way
for
example
would
be
to
have
all
interchange
take
place
down
here,
down
in
(inaudible)
and
then
our
appeal
to
the
connecting
carriers
could
be
limited
to
one
spot
and
had
no
effect
on
the
lessee
if
you
had
interchange
taking
place
down
here.
we
can
then
appeal
to
seaboard
and
acl
employees
not
to
make
that
interchange
but
in
other
words,
there
are
numerous
ways
and
certainly
discussions
where
has
--
had
preliminary
had
during
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
we
went
to
personnel
managers
and
the
general
counsel
of
these
railroads
and
said
we
don't
want
to
hurt
you
and
we're
willing
to
work
in
any
way
we
can
to
minimize
the
effect
of
this
on
you
but
we
do
want
to
appeal
to
your
employees
not
to
make
deliveries
to
take
deliveries
from
or
perform
services
for
this
trucking
carrier.
mr.
neal
rutledge
your
honor,
there's
a
very
significant
interest
for
us
to
limit
this
as
much
as
we
can
and
that
interest
is
our
own
self-interest
because
when
we
for
instance
put
picket
lines
around
the
entire
terminal
company
in
order
to
reach
the
fec
operation
this
puts
our
own
people
out
of
work
if
they
are
out
to
picket
lines.
i
mean,
they
put
our
brother
employees
out
of
work
and
we
have
a
very
material
interest
of
the
honoring
of
the
picket
line
hurts
the
laboring
man
as
much
as
it
hurts
the
employers.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that
certainly
is
what
we're
doing
in
this
dispute
because
were
compel
to
by
the
integrated
operation
here
but
if
we
can
work
out
in
arrangement
where
it
won't
be
integrated
we
have
very
motive
of
self-interest
to
limit
as
much
as
we
can.
mr.
neal
rutledge
we
do
have
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
neal
rutledge
that's
on
appeal.
mr.
neal
rutledge
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
tallahassee
and
it
was
also
before
this
court
on
a
probation
proceeding.
mr.
neal
rutledge
yes,
it's
pending
before
this
court.
