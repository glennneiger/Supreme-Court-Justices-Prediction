mr.
allan
milledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
turn
our
attention
for
a
moment
to
a
rather
fully
separable
jurisdictional
failure
of
the
district
court.
if
there
is
any
legislation
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
does
regulate
secondary
conduct
certainly
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
itself
in
terms
regulate
secondary
conduct
if
there
is
any
such
regulation,
it
is
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
there
is
a
question
and
we
say
it
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
respondents
here
is
arguably
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
conduct
is
characterized
as
being
secondary
activity,
it
wasn't
so
characterized
in
the
lower
court,
it
is
here
characterized
as
secondary
activity.
certainly,
it
is
arguably
secondary
activity
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
real
question
then
is,
are
we
a
labor
organization
and
that
is
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
train?
the
statute
says
that
labor
organization
may
not
appeal
to
employees
of
any
person,
a
railroad
is
such
a
person.
now,
we
don't
think
that
we
are
with
in
the
secondary
provisions
prohibitions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
but
we
are
a
labor
organization
because
we
represent
bus
drivers
and
a
labor
organization
is
an
organization
which
represents
employees
in
whole
or
impart
an
employees
are
employees
of
an
employer
under
the
act.
so,
we
are
within
a
literal
language
of
the
act
labor
organizations.
now,
we
wouldn't
have
thought
that
this
was
even
arguable
except
for
a
recent
decision,
idew
versus
nlrb
and
which
this
court
denied
certiorari.
there,
the
entire
dispute
was
in
the
railroad
industry,
it
was
the
same
11
non-operating
organizations.
two
of
them
who
were
pure
railway
labor
act
organizations
picketed
and
the
effort
of
picketing
was
cooperative
of
some
organizations
that
were
impart
railway
labor
and
impart
that
partly.
but
there,
they
were
representing
solely
railway
labor
but
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
this
circuit
rather
was
that
the
railway
organizations
were
labor
organizations
and
therefore
subject
to
these
provisions
of
the
act.
now,
this
is
the
same
point
which
is
before
this
court
now
in
the
companion
state
case
because
it
is
a
jurisdictional
at
fundamental
jurisdictional
matter
it
is
here
on
prohibition
rather
than
to
appeal
because
we
couldn't
obviously
get
it
ran
it
through
a
state
system
as
that
will
go
through
a
federal
system
but
we
do
have
it
here
on
prohibition
on
the
same
jurisdictional
basis.
mr.
allan
milledge
it
is
preemption.
well,
in
a
sense
it
is
preemptive
here
because
a
federal
court
would
have
no
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
no
more
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
injunction
that
there
has
to
be
a
private
party
than
with
state
court.
so,
certainly
within
a
literal
language
and
with
in
the
holding
of
idew
and
also
in
terms
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
meba
versus
interlake
in
which
there,
the
meba
representing
only
a
few
employees
was
there
representing
only
supervisors.
mr.
allan
milledge
please
the
court.
the
suggestion
has
been
advanced
by
petitioners
has
there,
the
primary
suggestion
in
their
brief
that
the
railway
labor
act
or
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
must
be
somehow
accommodated
to
the
railway
labor
act.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
while
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
railway
labor
act
has
been
accommodated
to
norris-laguardia
rather
vice
versa
and
that
there
have
been
injunctions
issued
in
railway
labor
matter
they
have
all
been
to
enforce
specific
duties
in
the
railway
labor
act
and
what
we
say
is
that
here
there
are
no
specific
duties.
the
railway
labor
act
doesn't
deal
with
the
subject
of
the
post
strike
conduct
of
labor
unions.
now,
the
cases
in
which
the
rather
clear
language
of
norris-laguardia
has
been
accommodated
to
railway
labor
act
or
to
enforce
the
duty
bargain
which
is
said
out
the
duty
to
represent
such
as
in
the
howard
and
steal
cases,
the
duty
to
arbitrate
under
of
minor
disputes
and
the
duty
to
mediate
a
major
disputes
up
until
a
breakdown
of
mediation
but
no
where
is
there
any
suggestion
by
petitioners
of
any
heart
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
here
requires
accommodation
what
they
have
asked,
what
they
asked
to
this
court
to
do
is
to
legislate
in
the
railway
labor
industry
a
type
of
post
strike
limitation
of
activities
similar
to
8
(b)
(4)
regulation
of
other
industry.
it's
a
rather
--
we
think
a
rather
blanton
request
to
this
court
to
legislate.
now,
whenever
this
--
the
issue
of
secondary
versus
primary
conduct
whenever
it
is
come
up
in
the
congress
there
have
been
fears,
battles
and
arguments
as
to
what
is
best
for
the
country
and
it
hasn't
always
been
the
same
up
until
1947.
we
didn't
have
any
federal
inhibitions
on
secondary
conduct
and
even
under
territorially
there
is
a
different
rule
has
been
pointed
out
for
the
garment
industry.
there
are
bills
now
pending
dealing
with
the
different
rules
for
the
construction
industry.
so,
the
content
what
should
be
the
content
of
such
judicial
legislation.
what
should
this
court
say,
should
you
have
--
should
you
make
up
now
some
special
one
for
the
railway
labor
industry,
should
it
turn
on
the
fact
for
instance
that
the
fec
owns
25%
of
its
terminal,
should
it
turn
on
whether
the
crews
are
operating
there
or
what
should
it
turn
on?
all
these
questions
are
matters
of
very
primary
public
policy
question
which
have
been
left
to
the
congress
quite
appropriately
because
it
is
a
battle
of
economic
forces.
congress
has
regulated
the
railway
labor
industry
quite
differently
that
it
has
the
rest
of
industry.
that's
needs
no
further
for
explanation.
railway
labor
is
tied
up
much
more
tightly
before
it
comes
to
the
point
of
a
strike
and
certainly
congress
contemplated
that
when
we
got
to
a
strike
situation
and
there's
railway
labor
industry
that
it
would
affect
not
only
the
struck
carrier
but
other
carriers
in
the
duty
section,
the
duty
of
a
railway
labor
carrier
is
to
prevent
a
breakdown
of
mediation
so
as
not
to
interrupt
itself
and
other
carriers.
now,
--
mr.
allan
milledge
there
are
duties
but
of
course
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
particularly
we
would
cite
telegraphers
in
which
the
labor
policy
of
the
united
states
is
not
to
be
subordinated
to
the
transportation
policy.
mr.
allan
milledge
the
clerk's
case?
mr.
allan
milledge
that
was
a
specific
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
27
which
required
carriers
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
and
we
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
that
is
the
none
ups
the
railway
labor
movement
that
you
couldn't
change
them
without
a
section
6
notice
and
of
course
that
was
essentially
the
holding
the
of
this
court
with
the
modification
of
reasonably
necessary
about
of
a
case
of
a
specific
duty
which
--
mr.
allan
milledge
right.
but
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
that
that
duty
is
not
absolute
duty
and
that
is
been
held
also
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
a
case
we
cite
here.
it
is
an
absolute
duty,
the
fec
as
most
railroads
with
a
strike
situation
can
operate.
mr.
allan
milledge
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
would
say
that
it
should
not
and
that
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
not
to
be
that
the
labor
policy
of
the
united
states
is
not
to
be
accommodated
to
the
transportation
act
by
itself.
mr.
allan
milledge
i
would
presume
so.
certainly,
that
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
clayton
act
makes
this
conduct
legal
unless
there
is
some
specific
provision
to
make
it
illegal.
certainly,
this
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
clayton
act,
no
such
restraining
order
injunction
shall
prohibit
any
person
from
seizing
to
perform
--
mr.
allan
milledge
hudson
would
be
a
good
example
of
that
--
mr.
allan
milledge
i
think
so,
yes.
there
could
be
of
course
a
situation
here,
it's
conceivable
it
could
be
--
the
situation
in
which
norris-laguardia
prohibits
the
injunction
and
yet
it
might
still
be
illegal
some
other
way,
that
would
be
a
--
we
think
an
incorrect
determination
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
hudson
case
which
is
the
holding
of
this
court
norris-laguardia
reads
like
back
into
the
clayton
act
which
makes
the
conduct
of
this
type
legal.
mr.
allan
milledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
turn
our
attention
for
a
moment
to
a
rather
fully
separable
jurisdictional
failure
of
the
district
court.
if
there
is
any
legislation
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
does
regulate
secondary
conduct
certainly
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
itself
in
terms
regulate
secondary
conduct
if
there
is
any
such
regulation,
it
is
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
there
is
a
question
and
we
say
it
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
respondents
here
is

the
fec
as
most
railroads
with
a
strike
situation
can
operate.
mr.
allan
milledge
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
would
say
that
it
should
not
and
that
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
not
to
be
that
the
labor
policy
of
the
united
states
is
not
to
be
accommodated
to
the
transportation
act
by
itself.
mr.
allan
milledge
i
would
presume
so.
certainly,
that
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
clayton
act
makes
this
conduct
legal
unless
there
is
some
specific
provision
to
make
it
illegal.
certainly,
this
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
clayton
act,
no
such
restraining
order
injunction
shall
prohibit
any
person
from
seizing
to
perform
--
mr.
allan
milledge
hudson
would
be
a
good
example
of
that
--
mr.
allan
milledge
i
think
so,
yes.
there
could
be
of
course
a
situation
here,
it's
conceivable
it
could
be
--
the
situation
in
which
norris-laguardia
prohibits
the
injunction
and
yet
it
might
still
be
illegal
some
other
way,
that
would
be
a
--
we
think
an
incorrect
determination
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
hudson
case
which
is
the
holding
of
this
court
norris-laguardia
reads
like
back
into
the
clayton
act
which
makes
the
conduct
of
this
type
legal.
