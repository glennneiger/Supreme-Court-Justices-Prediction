mr.
paul
a.
porter
mr.
porter
for
petitioner.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
and
mr.
lyons.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
asked
the
martial
to
bring
forward
here
on
easel
a
map
that
we
have
which
i
believe
will
of
some
assistance
in
making
clear
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
without
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
to
issue
an
injunction
against
the
picketing
which
suddenly
surrounded
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
and
effectively
prevented
all
rail
access
through
those
facilities.
now,
the
facts
about
the
turmoil
and
the
picketing,
we
think
are
essential
for
a
proper
understanding
of
this
case
and
i
will
undertake
that
task.
mr.
lyons
will
then
address
himself
to
some
of
the
underlying
legal
issues
that
are
involved.
the
jacksonville
terminal,
if
your
honor
please,
is
shown
in
green
here
on
this
map.
now,
this
represents
a
--
an
expanded
version
of
the
map
which
is
on
page
9
of
our
opening
brief.
now,
there's
a
basic
concept
with
respect
to
these
terminals
that
we
believe
is
important
to
comprehend
and
that
is
this
terminal
is
not
a
place
by
traffic
stops,
it
is
not
a
place
where
traffic
terminates.
brotherhoods
most
important
function
is
its
ways
through
which
traffic
moves
and
the
terminal
maybe
a
more
appropriately
described
we
think
as
a
gateway
or
a
thrown
of
commerce
to
which
all
the
rail
traffic
to
the
entire
commissioner
florida
flows.
now,
the
terminal
stands
upward
as
you
will
see
of
the
main
lines
of
the
principle
carriers.
here,
shown
on
this
map,
there's
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
which
is
in
blue
and
it
runs
down
from
the
north
of
richmond,
virginia
onto
tampa
and
points
south
of
--
in
to
mention
to
florida.
its
main
lines
enter
here
at
the
mcquade
street
and
exit
next
to
jonas
street.
that
is
marked
here.
if
you
cut
off
the
terminal
property
where
these
main
lines
run
through
thus
you
cut
off
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line.
here's
also
the
principal
main
line
of
the
seaboard
and
this
is
designated
here
in
orange.
as
you
can
see
the
seaboard,
enters
into
the
terminal
here
on
paton
street
and
exits
on
stockton
street.
so,
certainly
if
you
cut
off
the
terminal,
you
cut
off
the
main
line
of
the
seaboard.
now,
in
addition
this
main
line
control
operations
that
move
on
the
coastline
and
seaboard
which
do
not
involved
interchanges
between
any
carrier.
the
terminal
was
are
placed
through
which
there
is
a
considerable
interchange
of
freight
traffic
between
carriers
of
plants
coal
through
the
terminal
properties.
now,
these
interchanges
of
course
are
necessary
to
move
commodities
to
florida
or
necessary
for
the
vast
and
space
effort
and
therefore,
it
orders
from
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
to
interchange
their
freight
with
each
other,
these
cars
has
must
be
moved
into
and
through
the
terminal
property
and
say
it
was
a
keys
of
the
southern
railway
system
which
lies
in
within
the
terminal
here
and
are
shown
in
red.
the
same
is
true
on
the
struck
florida
east
coast
carrier
whose
lands
are
shown
in
brown
and
they
come
up
from
the
south
and
terminate
across
the
st.
john's
river
at
river
side
out
of
it.
that
is
the
northernmost
terminal
of
the
florida
east
coast.
it
moves
on
traffic
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes,
sir.
another
carrier
and
the
--
or
there's
the
atlantic
coast
line,
the
seaboard,
the
southern
and
the
fec.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
and
the
southern,
yes.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
fec
has
no
through
moves
through
this
terminal
and
even
when
you
consider
the
interchange
that
is
involved
on
the
main
lines
of
the
coastline
and
the
seaboard.
they
do
not
involve
interchanges
with
the
fec
plus
about
70%
of
all
the
freight
interchanges
involved
carriers
other
than
the
struck
fec.
that
is
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
southern.
and
i
think
that
another
relevant
measure
is
the
fact
that
the
coastline
for
example
generates
about
a
$100
million
in
freight
revenues
to
and
from
the
peninsula,
florida
and
only
about
$3
million
of
his
revenues
are
accounted
for
with
the
interchanges
with
the
fec.
now,
of
course
there
are
host
of
other
activities
are
performed
in
the
terminal
facilities.
this
is
where
all
u.s.
mail
flowing
into
and
out
of
peninsula,
florida
is
handled.
about
95%
of
the
entire
mail
volume
in
fact
passes
through
the
jacksonville
terminal
and
the
fec
handles
no
mail.
so,
you
cut
off
the
terminal
and
you
stop
the
flow
of
u.s.
mail
into
florida.
now,
on
local
level,
the
terminal
serves
are
number
of
industries
through
its
own
facilities
as
well
as
the
industries
that
are
located
around
the
various
yards
and
near
the
terminal
properties.
the
terminal
company
i
should
add
is
a
regulated
common
carrier
in
its
own
right.
now,
these
industries
which
are
served
by
the
terminal
properties
cut
off
the
terminal
facilities,
rail
service
to
those
industries
is
plus
terminated.
one
quick
example
perhaps
would
be
useful.
there
is
up
in
the
northeast
direction
here
from
the
terminal,
a
large
paper
mill
that
receives
about
3,000
cars
per
month
on
raw
material
and
ships
out
about
a
thousand
cars.
it
was
pointed
out
at
the
trial
court
that
it
would
shutdown
within
a
few
days
after
rail
service
was
discontinued
thus
eliminating
about
1600
jobs
in
the
area.
now,
the
terminal
is
also
an
important
place
for
having
passenger
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
passenger
terminal
in
north
east
florida
is
located
in
the
terminal
premises.
the
seaboard
and
coastline
moved
42
frames
per
day
through
the
terminal
facilities
whereas
the
florida
east
coast
has
only
one
train
each
day
which
operates
only
on
weekdays,
one
train
each
way
i
should
say.
now
in
addition
to
the
internal
yards
in
the
terminal
property
here,
in
the
y.h.
and
the
honeymoon
yards,
each
of
the
carriers
using
the
terminal
as
its
own
yard
outside
the
boundaries
of
terminal.
for
example,
coast
line
mount
free
yard
is
marked
there
and
the
seaboard
as
this
yard
the
west
jacksonville
yard
here
to
the
west.
whereas
i
think
this
is
some
of
significant
if
the
court
please,
the
fec
as
this
yard
known
as
the
bottom
yard
across
the
st.
john's
river
and
12
miles
distance
from
the
terminal.
the
southern
has
this
yard
up
near
the
mount
free
yard
known
as
the
simpson
yard.
now,
in
order
for
freight
movements,
one
carrier
to
be
interchanged
with
another,
the
delivering
carrier
brings
his
cars
and
his
own
crews
to
a
pre-assigned
point
either
within
the
terminal
or
by
means
of
a
movement
through
the
terminal
to
a
point
in
the
yards
of
the
other
carriers
and
leaves
the
cars
off
at
this
pre-arranged
point
then
receiving
carrier
with
these
groups
picks
up
the
cars
and
begins
the
process
of
taking
them
for
their
--
to
their
destination.
now,
in
order
for
the
fec
to
interchange
his
crew
has
bring
them
from
their
dalton
yards
12
miles
south
of
the
st.
john's
river
across
the
terminal
entering
here
and
then
at
the
terminal
property
of
southern,
pick
them
up,
take
them
and
distribute
them
to
the
pre-arranged
yards
and
there
they're
cut
in
to
a
through
movement.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
the
--
the
total
area
of
the
terminal
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
at
this
green
area
here
is
an
area
of
i
think
three-and-a-half
square
miles
and
it
includes
a
division
to
the
passengers
stations,
the
mail
ships,
mail
service,
railway
express
is
also
located
there
handling
about
two-and-a-half
million
packages
per
month.
so,
the
perimeter
of
this
terminal
is
--
i
may
have
overstated
it
but
it
is
the
orange
facility
of
perhaps
that
magnitude
and
the
terminal
of
these
other
properties
whose
rights
of
way
as
i
have
said
is
the
regulated
interstate
carrier
in
his
own
right.
i
think
this
court
is
familiar
because
the
case
that
was
here
the
last
term,
the
history
of
strikes
that
the
florida
east
coast
have
been
involved
for
the
past
three-and-a-half
years.
the
non-operating
brotherhoods
have
been
on
strike
since
1963
but
the
fec
has
operated
in
spite
of
that
strike.
now,
after
fec
sought
to
put
in
a
number
of
rule
changes
affecting
the
operating
brotherhoods,
those
brotherhoods
after
the
exhaustion
of
procedures
specified
in
the
railway
labor
act
went
on
strike
against
the
fec
in
april
of
this
year.
and
the
early
morning
hours
of
may
4
of
this
year,
without
advance
notice
or
warning,
the
operating
brotherhoods
through
a
picket
line
along
the
terminal
of
the
properties
and
these
numbers
here
show
the
location
and
the
numbers
of
the
pickets.
lots
of
pickets
were
placed
here
at
the
akron
street
crossing
where
the
mainline
of
the
seaboard
crosses
through
the
terminal
and
the
church
street
crossing
where
seaboards,
cars
were
having
destined
for
terminal
handling
also
entered.
and
similarly
of
pickets
were
stationed
at
the
jonas
street
and
the
mcquade
street
crossing
and
that
is
where
the
atlantic
coast
line
mainlines
enter
and
exit
from
the
terminal.
there
are
also
station
around
strategically
as
you
can
see
and
a
number
of
rail
and
food
entrances
used
by
the
terminal
company
and
their
own
employees.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
the
fec
gate
mr.
justice
brennan
ought
to
be
the
special
gate
that
was
established
for
fec
employees?
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that
is
located,
the
terminal
property
here
on
bay
and
stewart
street.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
bay
and
stewart,
yes.
and
i
was
going
to
comment
on
that
--
the
fact
of
that
special
gate
had
been
set
aside
since
1963
for
the
use
of
fec
employees.
but
the
picketing
of
the
terminal
at
the
early
morning
hours
of
may
4
caused
a
complete
secession
of
all
activity
in
the
terminal.
the
employees
who
were
at
work
worked
out
their
shelves
but
other
employees
refused
to
cross
the
picket
lines
including
the
employees
of
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company.
moreover,
trains
that
were
approaching
of
the
terminal
properties
stopped
and
refused
to
cross
the
picket
lines.
for
example
the
coastline's
train
number
375
that
was
running
at
dawn
from
richmond
stopped
at
the
quiad
street
entrance
and
they
had
to
wait
until
supervisory
employees
are
available
to
bring
into
the
terminal
because
the
crews
would
not
cross
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
i
don't
think
stewart
street
is
marked
on
the
map
opposite
page
9
your
honor
but
the
--
it's
right
at
the
terminal
where
the
--
where
if
you
will
see
on
page
9
that
the
map
doesn't
give
that
sufficient
detail
but
about
where
its
--
the
--
just
west
of
the
passenger
station
is
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
west
is
going
that
--
to
the
left.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
no,
it
was
not
on
this
map
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes.
well,
this
is
a
bay
and
stewart
street,
stewart
street
is
a
smaller.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
it
could
be
to
the
left.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
no,
it
would
be
just
about
a
block
out
of
this
zone.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes,
between
myrtle
and
park.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes.
myrtle
runs
down
in
here.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes.
now,
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
i
think
it
could
be
the
second
red
mark
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
mr.
justice
going
left,
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
just
west
of
the
passenger
station.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
and
that
is
where
mail
express
and
it's
a
convenient
access
of
those
employees
to
the
terminal.
now,
in
our
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
13
hours,
the
temporary
restraining
order.
there
was
a
--
that
was
the
day
that
the
jacksonville
board
got
out
the
bed
earlier
than
their
customer
hour
and
immediately
there
was
a
complaint
filed
in
district
court
with
supporting
affidavits.
there
was
oral
testimony.
later
in
the
day
judge
mcray
issued
his
temporary
restraining
order.
three
days
later,
there
was
another
contested
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
where
oral
testimony
was
taken
and
the
preliminary
injunction
was
issued.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
the
state
injunction
followed.
that
was
when
the
fifth
circuit
denied
the
stay
as
this
court
subsequently
granted.
now,
i
would
emphasize
if
your
honors
please
that
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company,
they
have
no
dispute
with
their
own
labor
forces.
the
terminal
company
as
well
as
the
coastline
and
the
seaboard
they
have
separate
contracts
with
the
brotherhoods
working
foreign.
now,
none
of
these
companies
has
the
approach
i
may
say
on
the
fec
to
labor
relations.
now,
this
court
knows
the
fec
was
the
only
class
one
carrier
in
the
country
that
did
not
accept
the
management
settlement
and
was
this
--
with
this
entire
background
that
the
district
court
after
it
contested
hearing
and
which
oral
testimony
received
issue
this
limited
preliminary
injunction.
i
guess
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
they
could
picket
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
at
the
fec
gate,
at
the
river
side
having
their
entrance
which
they
did
not
picket
and
up
and
down
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
fec
coastline.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes,
at
the
terminal.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
it
was
limited
as
i
say
to
that
extent.
now,
for
reason
which
mr.
lyons
will
develop
further,
it
is
our
position
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
correct
and
the
inability
or
the
unwillingness
or
even
stubbornness
of
the
fec
to
settle
this
long
standing
dispute
with
the
brotherhoods
cannot
and
should
not,
we
submit,
be
permitted
to
broaden
the
area
of
strike
and
shutdown
carriers
who
have
peaceful
relationships
with
their
own
employees.
if
you
will,
what
the
brotherhoods
barely
seeking
to
apply
here
is
a
principle
of
escalation
in
railway
affairs
which
if
carried
out
logically,
we
submit
could
paralyze
the
rail
transportation
of
this
country
even
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
potential
of
florida
for
we
cannot
even
realistically
conclude
that
even
if
the
fec
employees
were
able
to
shutdown
transportation
on
a
broad
regional
or
statewide
basis
that
such
a
calamity
would
result
in
setting
their
differences
with
the
apparently
intractable
florida
east
coast
railway.
we
submit
that
a
management
which
is
exhibited
and
approached
to
his
employees
such
of
the
fec
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
habituate
even
if
the
whole
commerce
of
the
nation
was
brought
to
a
granting
halt.
thus,
the
consequences
of
making
innocent
carriers
and
the
public
suffer
for
what
might
be
called
the
19th
century
attitude
of
a
recalls
of
the
carrier
is
really
awesome
when
you
consider
the
terms
and
the
impact
upon
the
nation's
transportation
system.
now,
preventing
the
closing
down
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
because
of
a
dispute
out
the
brotherhoods,
what
in
our
view
reduce
labor
railway
relationships
to
the
loss
common
denominator,
it
would
vastly
enlarge
the
effects
of
a
railway
labor
dispute
rather
than
containing
or
confining
it
as
we
insist
national
policy
requires.
the
picketing
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
in
our
view
amounts
to
a
direct
use
of
unlawful
economic
weapons
by
the
railway
brotherhoods
to
carriers
who
are
not
a
party
to
their
dispute
and
unless
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
limit
the
picketing
which
threaten
the
complete
shutdown
of
all
rail
transportation
to

of
florida.
neutral

under
innocent

and
the
public
are
threaten
with
irreparable
injury
for
which
no
remedy
would
be
available.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
i
understand
they
are,
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes.
although,
i
believe
the
jacksonville
terminal
has
some
unique
characteristics
and
that
it
has
through
movement
functions.
thus,
mail
express
in
fact,
that
all
the
commerce
going
to
potential
of
florida
must
use
of
necessity
these
terminal
facilities.
so,
therefore
as
mr.
lyons
will
summarize
we
take
the
position
the
federal
courts
under
these
circumstances
are
certainly
not
impotent
to
prevent
such
a
disastrous
escalation
of
the
struggle
between
the
fec
and
his
brotherhoods.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
mr.
porter
for
petitioner.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
and
mr.
lyons.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
asked
the
martial
to
bring
forward
here
on
easel
a
map
that
we
have
which
i
believe
will
of
some
assistance
in
making
clear
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
without
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
to
issue
an
injunction
against
the
picketing
which
suddenly
surrounded
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
and
effectively
prevented
all
rail
access
through
those
facilities.
now,
the
facts
about
the
turmoil
and
the
picketing,
we
think
are
essential
for
a
proper
understanding
of
this
case
and
i
will
undertake
that
task.
mr.
lyons
will
then
address
himself
to
some
of
the
underlying
legal
issues
that
are
involved.
the
jacksonville
terminal,
if
your
honor
please,
is
shown
in
green
here
on
this
map.
now,
this
represents
a
--
an
expanded
version
of
the
map
which
is
on
page
9
of
our
opening
brief.
now,
there's
a
basic
concept
with
respect
to
these
terminals
that
we
believe
is
important
to
comprehend
and
that
is
this
terminal
is
not
a
place
by
traffic
stops,
it
is
not
a
place
where
traffic
terminates.
brotherhoods
most
important
function
is
its
ways
through
which
traffic
moves
and
the
terminal
maybe
a
more
appropriately
described
we
think
as
a
gateway
or
a
thrown
of
commerce
to
which
all
the
rail
traffic
to
the
entire
commissioner
florida
flows.
now,
the
terminal
stands
upward
as
you
will
see
of
the
main
lines
of
the
principle
carriers.
here,
shown
on
this
map,
there's
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
which
is
in
blue
and
it
runs
down
from
the
north
of
richmond,
virginia
onto
tampa
and
points
south
of
--
in
to
mention
to
florida.
its
main
lines
enter
here
at
the
mcquade
street
and
exit
next
to
jonas
street.
that
is
marked
here.
if
you
cut
off
the
terminal
property
where
these
main
lines
run
through
thus
you
cut
off
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line.
here's
also
the
principal
main
line
of
the
seaboard
and
this
is
designated
here
in
orange.
as
you
can
see
the
seaboard,
enters
into
the
terminal
here
on
paton
street
and
exits
on
stockton
street.
so,
certainly
if
you
cut
off
the
terminal,
you
cut
off
the
main
line
of
the
seaboard.
now,
in
addition
this
main
line
control
operations
that
move
on
the
coastline
and
seaboard
which
do
not
involved
interchanges
between
any
carrier.
the
terminal
was
are
placed
through
which
there
is
a
considerable
interchange
of
freight
traffic
between
carriers
of
plants
coal
through
the
terminal
properties.
now,
these
interchanges
of
course
are
necessary
to
move
commodities
to
florida
or
necessary
for
the
vast
and
space
effort
and
therefore,
it
orders
from
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
to
interchange
their
freight
with
each
other,
these
cars
has
must
be
moved
into
and
through
the
terminal
property
and
say
it
was
a
keys
of
the
southern
railway
system
which
lies
in
within
the
terminal
here
and
are
shown
in
red.
the
same
is
true
on
the
struck
florida
east
coast
carrier
whose
lands
are
shown
in
brown
and
they
come
up
from
the
south
and
terminate
across
the
st.
john's
river
at
river
side
out
of
it.
that
is
the
northernmost
terminal
of
the
florida
east
coast.
it
moves
on
traffic
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes,
sir.
another
carrier
and
the
--
or
there's
the
atlantic
coast
line,
the
seaboard,
the
southern
and
the
fec.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
and
the
southern,
yes.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
fec
has
no
through
moves
through
this
terminal
and
even
when
you
consider
the
interchange
that
is
involved
on
the
main
lines
of
the
coastline
and
the
seaboard.
they
do
not
involve
interchanges
with
the
fec
plus
about
70%
of
all
the
freight
interchanges
involved
carriers
other
than
the
struck
fec.
that
is
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
southern.
and
i
think
that
another
relevant
measure
is
the
fact
that
the
coastline
for
example
generates
about
a
$100
million
in
freight
revenues
to
and
from
the
peninsula,
florida
and
only
about
$3
million
of
his
revenues
are
accounted
for
with
the
interchanges
with
the
fec.
now,
of
course
there
are
host
of
other
activities
are
performed
in
the
terminal
facilities.
this
is
where
all
u.s.
mail
flowing
into
and
out
of
peninsula,
florida
is
handled.
about
95%
of
the
entire
mail
volume
in
fact
passes
through
the
jacksonville
terminal
and
the
fec
handles
no
mail.
so,
you
cut
off
the
terminal
and
you
stop
the
flow
of
u.s.
mail
into
florida.
now,
on
local
level,
the
terminal
serves
are
number
of
industries
through
its
own
facilities
as
well
as
the
industries
that
are
located
around
the
various
yards
and
near
the
terminal
properties.
the
terminal
company
i
should
add
is
a
regulated
common
carrier
in
its
own
right.
now,
these
industries
which
are
served
by
the
terminal
properties
cut
off
the
terminal
facilities,
rail
service
to
those
industries
is
plus
terminated.
one
quick
example
perhaps
would
be
useful.
there
is
up
in
the
northeast
direction
here
from
the
terminal,
a
large
paper
mill
that
receives
about
3,000
cars
per
month
on
raw
material
and
ships
out
about
a
thousand
cars.
it
was
pointed
out
at
the
trial
court
that
it
would
shutdown
within
a
few
days
after
rail
service
was
discontinued
thus
eliminating
about
1600
jobs
in
the
area.
now,
the
terminal
is
also
an
important
place
for
having
passenger
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
passenger
terminal
in
north
east
florida
is
located
in
the
terminal
premises.
the
seaboard
and
coastline
moved
42
frames
per
day
through
the
terminal
facilities
whereas
the
florida
east
coast
has
only
one
train
each
day
which
operates
only
on
weekdays,
one
train
each
way
i
should
say.
now
in
addition
to
the
internal
yards
in
the
terminal
property
here,
in
the
y.h.
and
the
honeymoon
yards,
each
of
the
carriers
using
the
terminal
as
its
own
yard
outside
the
boundaries
of
terminal.
for
example,
coast
line
mount
free
yard
is
marked
there
and
the
seaboard
as
this
yard
the
west
jacksonville
yard
here
to
the
west.
whereas
i
think
this
is
some
of
significant
if
the
court
please,
the
fec
as
this
yard
known
as
the
bottom
yard
across
the
st.
john's
river
and
12
miles
distance
from
the
terminal.
the
southern
has
this
yard
up
near
the
mount
free
yard
known
as
the
simpson
yard.
now,
in
order
for
freight
movements,
one
carrier
to
be
interchanged
with
another,
the
delivering
carrier
brings
his
cars
and
his
own
crews
to
a
pre-assigned
point
either
within
the
terminal
or
by
means
of
a
movement
through
the
terminal
to
a
point
in
the
yards
of
the
other
carriers
and
leaves
the
cars
off
at
this
pre-arranged
point
then
receiving
carrier
with
these
groups
picks
up
the
cars
and
begins
the
process
of
taking
them
for
their
--
to
their
destination.
now,
in
order
for
the
fec
to
interchange
his
crew
has
bring
them
from
their
dalton
yards
12
miles
south
of
the
st.
john's
river
across
the
terminal
entering
here
and
then
at
the
terminal
property
of
southern,
pick
them
up,
take
them
and
distribute
them
to
the
pre-arranged
yards
and
there
they're
cut
in
to
a
through
movement.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
the
--
the
total
area
of
the
terminal
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
at
this
green
area
here
is
an
area
of
i
think
three-and-a-half
square
miles
and
it
includes
a
division
to
the
passengers
stations,
the
mail
ships,
mail
service,
railway
express
is
also
located
there
handling
about
two-and-a-half
million
packages
per
month.
so,
the
perimeter
of
this
terminal
is
--
i
may
have
overstated
it
but
it
is
the
orange
facility
of
perhaps
that
magnitude
and
the
terminal
of
these
other
properties
whose
rights
of
way
as
i
have
said
is
the
regulated
interstate
carrier
in
his
own
right.
i
think
this
court
is
familiar
because
the
case
that
was
here
the
last
term,
the
history
of
strikes
that
the
florida
east
coast
have
been
involved
for
the
past
three-and-a-half
years.
the
non-operating
brotherhoods
have
been
on
strike
since
1963
but
the
fec
has
operated
in
spite
of
that
strike.
now,
after
fec
sought
to
put
in
a
number
of
rule
changes
affecting
the
operating
brotherhoods,
those
brotherhoods
after
the
exhaustion
of
procedures
specified
in
the
railway
labor
act
went
on
strike
against
the
fec
in
april
of
this
year.
and
the
early
morning
hours
of
may
4
of
this
year,
without
advance
notice
or
warning,
the
operating
brotherhoods
through
a
picket
line
along
the
terminal
of
the
properties
and
these
numbers
here
show
the
location
and
the
numbers
of
the
pickets.
lots
of
pickets
were
placed
here
at
the
akron
street
crossing
where
the
mainline
of
the
seaboard
crosses
through
the
terminal
and
the
church
street
crossing
where
seaboards,
cars
were
having
destined
for
terminal
handling
also
entered.
and
similarly
of
pickets
were
stationed
at
the
jonas
street
and
the
mcquade
street
crossing
and
that
is
where
the
atlantic
coast
line
mainlines
enter
and
exit
from
the
terminal.
there
are
also
station
around
strategically
as
you
can
see
and
a
number
of
rail
and
food
entrances
used
by
the
terminal
company
and
their
own
employees.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
the
fec
gate
mr.
justice
brennan
ought
to
be
the
special
gate
that
was
established
for
fec
employees?
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that
is
located,
the
terminal
property
here
on
bay
and
stewart
street.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
bay
and
stewart,
yes.
and
i
was
going
to
comment
on
that
--
the
fact
of
that
special
gate
had
been
set
aside
since
1963
for
the
use
of
fec
employees.
but
the
picketing
of
the
terminal
at
the
early
morning
hours
of
may
4
caused
a
complete
secession
of
all
activity
in
the
terminal.
the
employees
who
were
at
work
worked
out
their
shelves
but
other
employees
refused
to
cross
the
picket
lines
including
the
employees
of
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company.
moreover,
trains
that
were
approaching
of
the
terminal
properties
stopped
and
refused
to
cross
the
picket
lines.
for
example
the
coastline's
train
number
375
that
was
running
at
dawn
from
richmond
stopped
at
the
quiad
street
entrance
and
they
had
to
wait
until
supervisory
employees
are
available
to
bring
into
the
terminal
because
the
crews
would
not
cross
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
i
don't
think
stewart
street
is
marked
on
the
map
opposite
page
9
your
honor
but
the
--
it's
right
at
the
terminal
where
the
--
where
if
you
will
see
on
page
9
that
the
map
doesn't
give
that
sufficient
detail
but
about
where
its
--
the
--
just
west
of
the
passenger
station
is
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
west
is
going
that
--
to
the
left.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
no,
it
was
not
on
this
map
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes.
well,
this
is
a
bay
and
stewart
street,
stewart
street
is
a
smaller.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
it
could
be
to
the
left.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
no,
it
would
be
just
about
a
block
out
of
this
zone.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes,
between
myrtle
and
park.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes.
myrtle
runs
down
in
here.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes.
now,
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
i
think
it
could
be
the
second
red
mark
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
mr.
justice
going
left,
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
just
west
of
the
passenger
station.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
and
that
is
where
mail
express
and
it's
a
convenient
access
of
those
employees
to
the
terminal.
now,
in
our
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
13
hours,
the
temporary
restraining
order.
there
was
a
--
that
was
the
day
that
the
jacksonville
board
got
out
the
bed
earlier
than
their
customer
hour
and
immediately
there
was
a
complaint
filed
in
district
court
with
supporting
affidavits.
there
was
oral
testimony.
later
in
the
day
judge
mcray
issued
his
temporary
restraining
order.
three
days
later,
there
was
another
contested
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
where
oral
testimony
was
taken
and
the
preliminary
injunction
was
issued.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
the
state
injunction
followed.
that
was
when
the
fifth
circuit
denied
the
stay
as
this
court
subsequently
granted.
now,
i
would
emphasize
if
your
honors
please
that
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company,
they
have
no
dispute
with
their
own
labor
forces.
the
terminal
company
as
well
as
the
coastline
and
the
seaboard
they
have
separate
contracts
with
the
brotherhoods
working
foreign.
now,
none
of
these
companies
has
the
approach
i
may
say
on
the
fec
to
labor
relations.
now,
this
court
knows
the
fec
was
the
only
class
one
carrier
in
the
country
that
did
not
accept
the
management
settlement
and
was
this
--
with
this
entire
background
that
the
district
court
after
it
contested
hearing
and
which
oral
testimony
received
issue
this
limited
preliminary
injunction.
i
guess
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
porter
they
could
picket
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
at
the
fec
gate,
at
the
river
side
having
their
entrance
which
they
did
not
picket
and
up
and
down
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
fec
coastline.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
yes,
at
the
terminal.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
it
was
limited
as
i
say
to
that
extent.
now,
for
reason
which
mr.
lyons
will
develop
further,
it
is
our
position
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
correct
and
the
inability
or
the
unwillingness
or
even
stubbornness
of
the
fec
to
settle
this
long
standing
dispute
with
the
brotherhoods
cannot
and
should
not,
we
submit,
be
permitted
to
broaden
the
area
of
strike
and
shutdown
carriers
who
have
peaceful
relationships
with
their
own
employees.
if
you
will,
what
the
brotherhoods
barely
seeking
to
apply
here
is
a
principle
of
escalation
in
railway
affairs
which
if
carried
out
logically,
we
submit
could
paralyze
the
rail
transportation
of
this
country
even
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
potential
of
florida
for
we
cannot
even
realistically
conclude
that
even
if
the
fec
employees
were
able
to
shutdown
transportation
on
a
broad
regional
or
statewide
basis
that
such
a
calamity
would
result
in
setting
their
differences
with
the
apparently
intractable
florida
east
coast
railway.
we
submit
that
a
management
which
is
exhibited
and
approached
to
his
employees
such
of
the
fec
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
habituate
even
if
the
whole
commerce
of
the
nation
was
brought
to
a
granting
halt.
thus,
the
consequences
of
making
innocent
carriers
and
the
public
suffer
for
what
might
be
called
the
19th
century
attitude
of
a
recalls
of
the
carrier
is
really
awesome
when
you
consider
the
terms
and
the
impact
upon
the
nation's
transportation
system.
now,
preventing
the
closing
down
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
because
of
a
dispute
out
the
brotherhoods,
what
in
our
view
reduce
labor
railway
relationships
to
the
loss
common
denominator,
it
would
vastly
enlarge
the
effects
of
a
railway
labor
dispute
rather
than
containing
or
confining
it
as
we
insist
national
policy
requires.
the
picketing
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
in
our
view
amounts
to
a
direct
use
of
unlawful
economic
weapons
by
the
railway
brotherhoods
to
carriers
who
are
not
a
party
to
their
dispute
and
unless
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
limit
the
picketing
which
threaten
the
complete
shutdown
of
all
rail
transportation
to
potential
of
florida.
neutral
carriers
under
innocent
third
parties
and
the
public
are
threaten
with
irreparable
injury
for
which
no
remedy
would
be
available.
mr.
paul
a.
porter
i
understand
they
are,
mr.
justice
harlan,
yes.
although,
i
believe
the
jacksonville
terminal
has
some
unique
characteristics
and
that
it
has
through
movement
functions.
thus,
mail
express
in
fact,
that
all
the
commerce
going
to
potential
of
florida
must
use
of
necessity
these
terminal
facilities.
so,
therefore
as
mr.
lyons
will
summarize
we
take
the
position
the
federal
courts
under
these
circumstances
are
certainly
not
impotent
to
prevent
such
a
disastrous
escalation
of
the
struggle
between
the
fec
and
his
brotherhoods.
thank
you.
