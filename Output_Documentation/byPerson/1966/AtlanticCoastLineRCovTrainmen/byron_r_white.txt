justice

r.
white
just
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
lyons,
as
i
gather
that
your
position
wouldn't
--
this
isn't
necessarily
a
picketing
case
as
i
gather
in
the
injunction
runs
to
get
any
kind
of
secondary
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
even
if
the
--
if
all
picketing
stop
and
all
patrolling
stop
and
the
officers
of
the
brotherhoods
asked
those
employee
of
the
other
lines
not
to
work
the
other
line
and
they
didn't,
this
injunction
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
really
general
injunction
if
any
secondary
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
under
any
other
circumstances
then
where
there
was
secondary
activity
involved,
you
would
think
an
injunction
would
not
be
barred
by
any
endorsement
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
general
--
solicitor
general,
the
exception
in
norris-laguardia,
no
secondary
activity
is
within
the
protection
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
accommodation.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
both
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
just
(voice
overlap)
to
indicate
that
it
wasn't
limited
to
this
kind
of
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
--
would
you
or
wouldn't
you
permit
direct
appeal
to
the
other
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
brotherhoods
just
appeal
to
your
client
directly?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
can
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
you're
really
saying
as
i
gather
is
that
in
--
and
then
nlra
language
in
the
way
that
(voice
overlap)
says
that
for
this
is
primary
picketing.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
across
the
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
those
secondary
activity
whatsoever
and
that
was
in,
if
these
were
subject
for
the
nlra
this
would
be
ruled
primary
picketing
--
subject
to
injunction
of
your
or
damages
under
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
a
lot
of
--
i
take
it
a
lot
of
passenger
movements
originate
here
for
the
fec.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
then
terminate?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
trade?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
in
the
ordinary
labor
dispute
under
the
nlra
if
i
--
the
unions
got
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer,
it's
picketing
the
manufacture
its
gate
and
the
manufacture
is
operating
with
replacements
and
producing
goods
and
the
goods
come
out
at
gate
and
they
go
down
to
street
to
a
customer,
to
a
processor
and
there's
a
sale
transaction
and
you
deliver
to
that
processor.
the
union
wants
to
picket
that
transaction
between
selling
manufacturer
with
whom
they
have
a
primary
dispute
and
the
processor.
and
they
go
down
there
and
picket
the
point
of
delivery
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
how
about
going
around
to
the
other
gate
of
the
processor
where
the
processor's
employees
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
on
a
little
bit
of
trouble,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we're
not
talking
about
the
garment
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
rules
that
you
make
about
secondary
or
primary
what
the
line
between
primary
and
secondary
is
may
well
depend
on
the
industries.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
may
well
depend
on
a
particular
practical
aspect
of
either
company
relationship.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
exactly
what
this
argument
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
conceding
mr.
rutledge
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
conceding
that
you
have
a
problem
as
somebody
put
this
to
the
picketing
secondary
aspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
the
railroad
labor
act
previews
to
--
wasn't
it
to
disallow
a
secondary,
honest
to
goodness
secondary
activity,
secondary
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
the
neutral
or
enacted
prohibited
appeals
neutral
--
to
the
employees
of
neutral
employers.
now,
is
that
what
you're
trying
to
do
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
someone
might
picket
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
--
why
can't
do
it
--
it's
under
the
fec
trains
all
if
fec
come
in
and
leave
by
one
gate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you
--
why
can't
you
just
picket
if
it
most
to
the
fec
employees
which
are
really
the
people
you're
making
your
appeal
to.
i
mean,
it
force
a
--
if
you
really
relying
on
the
fact
that
is
primary
rather
than
secondary.
i
knew
i
got
you're
totally
relying
but
is
that
what
you
relying
on
or
what
you
really
have
to
do
is
to
say
you're
appealing
to
fec
employees,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
you
just
picket
those
gates
where
the
fec
employees
who
really
do
that
work
in
its
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
have
know
--
there
apparently
no
other
fec
employees
for
any
significance
better
on
it
accept
on
those
pay,
why
don't
you
just
picket
those
gate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
he
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
wouldn't
that
be
the
limit,
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
limit
of
so
called
primary
picket?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
to
anybody
who
is
regularly
contributing
to
the
running
of
the
establish
of
which
you
have
at
primary
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
one
of
the
places
where
the
fec
has
regularly
nourished?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
must
admit
though
that
within
this
terminal
not
only
to
fec
doing
a
lot
of
business
but
so
of
the
other
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
doing
--
fec
is
doing
a
lot
of
business
in
that
terminal
with
has
no
connection
with
the
other
line
and
somewhere
to
the
other
line
to
do
a
lot
of
business
at
terminal
absolutely
no
connection
with
fec.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
this
is
addressed
to
the
ordinary
case
of
an
injunction
to
where
you
seal
off
the
primary
employer
from
all
the
connection.
here,
you're
now
in
sealing
off
the
primary
employer
of
employer
connection
but
--
has
independent
business
in
the
terminal
which
you
claim
to
have
the
right
to
inhibit
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
already
admitted
that
you
let
the
atlantic
trains
to
go
there
without
any
interruption.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
this
is
really
is
the
old
common
side
of
problem
that
the
demands
on
the
primary
employer
or
had
custom
over
the
damage
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
suppose
that
if
that
have
an
injunction
is
issue
here
against
here
union
a
damage
action
would
lie
also,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
damage
action
is
been
forbidden
under
the
same
provisions
because
injunction
can
damage
action
sits
down
on
the
same
two
feet
with
respect
to
this
activity
there
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
guess
maybe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
we're
dealing
--
we're
talking
about
damage
is
an
injunction?
