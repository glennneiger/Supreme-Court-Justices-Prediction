mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
position
that
we
take
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
is
the
position
which
the
court
recognized
in
the
chicago
river
case
about
a
decade
ago.
there,
after
quoting
from
the
legislative
of
history
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
particularly
a
dialogue
that
representative
la-guardia
had
with
representative
lincoln,
the
court
said,
we
hold
that
the
norris-la
guardia
act
cannot
be
read
alone
in
matters
dealing
with
railway
labor
disputes.
there
must
be
an
accommodation
of
that
statute
to
the
railway
labor
act.
so,
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
each
is
persevered.
we
think
that
the
purposes
of
these
acts
are
reconcilable.
with
that
in
mind,
we
turn
to
section
2
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
declares
its
purposes
as
including,
avoiding
any
interruption
to
commerce
or
to
the
operation
of
any
carrier
engaged
therein
and
also
to
provide
for
the
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes.
as
this
court
put
it,
the
meaning
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
its
purpose
is
to
channel
--
to
setup
channels
for
the
forces
of
economic
strike
in
the
railway
industry
and
the
special
processes
which
were
intended
to
compromise
them.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
procedures
are
provided
which
in
virtually
all
cases
supersede
and
replace
the
right
to
strike
and
picket.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
with
the
minor
disputes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
here,
we
have
as
between
the
florida
east
coast
and
its
brotherhoods,
there
have
been
certain
procedures.
there
have
been
the
major
dispute
procedures
which
were
setup
under
section
6
of
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
as
between
the
carriers
that
are
involved
here
today,
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
and
the
terminal
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
brotherhoods
on
the
other
who
not
only
of
course
represents
the
workers
of
the
fec
but
also
represent
the
workers
at
the
carriers
that
are
involved
here
today.
we
have
had
no
procedures
yet.
there
have
been
no
procedures
that
the
carriers
that
are
here
today
have
had
benefit
some.
it
would
be
our
position
that
if
the
brotherhoods
wish
to
attempt
to
do
what
they
did
in
morning
of
may
4
that
the
procedure
that
they
would
have
to
follow
and
we
would
not
admit
that
it's
open
to
them
but
the
procedures
that
they
would
follow
to
test
whether
they
could
generate
a
dispute
between
these
carriers
and
themselves
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
would
be
to
file
section
6
notices
and
to
take
the
position
that
the
agreements
between
these
carriers
and
themselves
relating
to
the
work
practices
within
the
terminal
area
should
be
revised
to
provide
that
their
employees
for
the
man
in
the
crafts
that
they
represent
would
not
be
required
to
touch
fec
cars.
now,
the
brotherhoods
haven't
initiated
any
such
procedures.
i
would
like
to
make
very
clear
that
they
were
to
institute
them
that
would
be
in
the
first
instance
the
position
of
the
carriers
that
this
is
not
a
bargainable
matter
under
section
6.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
their
signs
represented
a
referred
to
the
major
dispute
with
the
fec.
however,
the
first
words
that
appears
--
the
first
words
of
exhortation
to
the
workers
were
“do
not
cross.”
it
went
on
to
say
do
not
assist
the
fec
but
the
first
words
on
the
sign
were
“do
not
cross”
and
what
happens
was
that
the
brotherhoods,
the
men
in
the
trains,
the
man
on
foot
did
not
cross.
there
was
a
train
that
came
down
from
richmond,
virginia
that
arrived
in
the
early
daylight
of
powers
on
the
atlantic
coast
line
mainline
and
it
was
stopped
by
picketing
at
the
quaid
street.
an
interruption
of
the
mainline
movement
or
movement
there
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fec.
what
we
suggest
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
dialogue
between
representative
la-guardia
and
representative
lincoln
we
think
it's
very
revealing.
congressman
la-guardia
said,
the
“railroad
labor
act
takes
care
of
the
whole
labor
situation
pertaining
to
the
railroads.
they
could
not
possibly
come
under
this
for
the
reason
that
we
provided
the
machinery
there
for
settling
labor
disputes.”
now,
our
position
is
that
if
there
is
a
dispute,
if
there
is
controversy
to
which
the
procedures
of
the
act
do
not
relate
then
congress
did
not
intend
that
to
be
recognized
as
a
labor
dispute
in
the
rail
industry
and
its
intention
there
was
that
commerce
should
go
on.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
contend
that
there
is
a
controversy
of
a
commercial
nature.
it
may
be
that
they
are
taking
the
position
that
their
men
should
not
handle
the
fec
cars
within
the
terminal.
they
have
rather
of
course
phrase
it
in
terms
of
the
commercial
controversies
that
they
don't
wish
the
railroad
managements
to
do
business
with
the
fec.
now,
the
carriers
to
be
the
way
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
have
a
dispute
with
the
florida
east
coast.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
apparently
have
a
controversy
with
our
clients.
they're
asking
--
they're
asking
our
client
to
do
something
that
are
--
our
client
is
on
the
position
to
do
and
there
are
proceedings
as
far
as
economic
gloss
against
our
clients
if
they
don't
do
it.
and
to
me,
that's
a
controversy.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
we
have
first
take
that
position
whether
our
position
is
right
as
a
matter
that
would
have
to
be
decided.
our
position
would
be
first
that
this
is
essentially
commercial
controversy
both
the
purposes
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
for
purposes
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
which
has
to
be
read
with
the
railway
labor
act
in
railway
labor
matters
and
that
equally
for
the
same
reason
that
the
norris-la
guardia
act
does
not
prohibit
an
injunction
here
against
the
commercial
pressures
that
are
sought
to
be
put
on
that
a
section
6
norris
could
not
be
proper.
however,
if
it
turned
out
that
the
section
6
notice
was
proper
and
this
raised
a
bargainable
issue,
we
would
then
have
the
situation
that
presented
this
court
--
was
presented
to
this
court
in
the
la
guardia
case
where
this
court
held
that
only
at
the
end
of
the
line
if
the
procedures
were
exhausted
or
if
the
carrier
refused
to
bargain
with
be
norris-la
guardia
act
come
into
play.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
for
that
situation,
our
basic
position
your
honor
is
that
there
is
not
a
labor
dispute
between
the
coastline
and
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
unions
on
the
other
that
there
is
a
commercial
controversy
and
that
the
unions
desire
the
railroad
to
embargo
the
fec.
if
however,
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
that
and
there
is
the
start
of
a
labor
dispute
here,
i
don't
think
there
are
actually
could
be
a
labor
dispute
started
until
the
union's
channel
into
that
procedure
until
they
serve
the
section
6
notice
which
they
haven't
done.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
in
that
light
of
that
your
honor,
if
that's
--
if
that
remains
their
position
then
they
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
those
circumstances
would
be
the
--
the
only
circumstances
under
which
the
actual
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
could
be
followed
here.
the
accommodation
that
we
are
essentially
urging
this
court
to
make
between
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
norris-la
guardia
act
relates
to
the
definition
of
dispute
in
those
two
acts.
and
we
urge
the
court
to
follow
the
same
definition
of
dispute
in
the
two
acts
and
to
harmonize
the
two
statutes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
our
position
on
that
is
this
your
honor.
first,
there
is
no
labor
dispute
certainly
here
on
the
ordinary
sense.
there's
no
controversy
as
to
the
wages
or
hours
or
working
conditions
of
the
employees
of
the
seaboard
or
the
coastline
or
the
terminal
company.
there
is
a
however
a
commercial
controversy.
there's
obviously
controversy
here
between
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
and
the
terminal
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
unions
on
the
other.
the
unions
are
putting
crosier
upon
the
three
carriers
to
do
something
that
the
carriers
are
not
in
the
position
to
do
and
they
are
proceeding
to
disrupt
their
commerce
if
they
don't
do
it.
that's
the
sort
of
controversy
that
exists
here.
what
i'm
suggesting
however
is
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
congress
in
passing
the
railway
labor
act
in
short
never
--
never
dreamed
that
unions
would
resort
to
a
tactic
of
the
sort
involved
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
essentially
our
position
your
honor
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
court
has
to
take
the
two
we
suggest
to
take
a
two
statutes
together
and
give
them
a
harmonizing
reading
between
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
believe
in
just
to
try
to
do
this
before.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
besides
i
think
if
we
go
back
in
to
history
there
probably
before
the
adjustment
boards
were
setup
and
certainly
before
the
‘34
act
where
the
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
were
made
mandatory.
i
believe
that
there
were
localized
strikes
over
grievances
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
those
are
generally
been
on
more
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
a
broader
basis.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
there's
never
been
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
know
of
any
case
and
which
either
on
grievance
in
the
334
era
where
there
was
an
attempt
to
impose
the
secondary
boycott
of
this
sort
in
order
to
put
pressure
on
the
carrier
that
have
grievance.
so,
i
think
this
is
unprecedented--
as
a
factual
matter
because
this
tactic
has
not
been
used
by
unions.
as
i've
said
they
may
well
in
the
early
areas
have
been
opportunities
to
use
it.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
it's
quite
clear
under
the
cases
interpreting
the
proviso
to
section
84
as
this
court
said
in
one
of
the
cases
have
been
decided
in
the
60's.
i
--
here,
there
was
no
effort
made
to
minimize
the
effect
of
the
picketing
upon
the
unrelated
operations
of
the
innocent
employers.
what
we
have
here
is
a
surrounding
of
the
perimeter
of
the
terminal
company
including
places
where
their
only
mainline
moves
and
the
closing
down
of
all
movements,
not
simply
movements
that
have
something
to
do
with
the
fec.
it
isn't
like
the
cases
where
you
have
a
railroad
delivering
cars
to
an
industry
and
the
industry
is
struck
where
the
picketing
is
applied
at
that
point
which
might
beyond
the
railroads
own
property
but
where
the
effect
can
be
limited.
here,
the
effect
is
not
limited
and
this
appears
to
the
case
for
this
held
not
sort
case
sought
not
to
be
saved
by
the
proviso.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct
your
honor
and
actually
the
consequences
of
having
the
price
of
further
experience
would
have
been
pretty
dear.
for
one
thing
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
if
the
very
day
that
mail
facility
at
the
terminal
was
shutdown
and
it
would
take
six
days
to
catch
up
and
that
was
the
testimony
that
was
given
in
the
light
of
the
monday
closing
and
the
--
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
industrial
users
in
duval
county
would
be
cut
off
and
before
the
effects
of
the
strike
beyond
if
they
felt
throughout
all
the
peninsular
florida.
this
is
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
that
goes
through
these
premises
that
is
one
main
carriers
that
serves
between
this
part
of
the
country
and
in
florida
has
also
a
principle
line
of
the
seaboard
that
was
closed
down
by
this
picketing.
and
the
--
and
neither
the
facts
of
these
were
quite
clear
indication
of
what
the
effects
would
have
been
if
the
striking
or
picketing
if
the
picketing
went
on.
the
--
to
make
a
first
case
that
this
court
decided
back
in
1960,
we
think
those
are
clear
indication
of
the
way
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
meant
to
operate
in
the
railway
labor
field.
the
way
it
operates
is
that
when
two
parties
are
locked
in
a
major
dispute
something
for
which
the
act
provides
procedures
but
norris-laguardia
act
tells
them
that
down
at
the
end
of
the
road
that
they're
traveling
the
road
of
negotiation
and
mediation
if
they
can
settle
that
dispute
through
those
processes
that
the
law
is
going
to
leave
them
free
to
use
economic
warfare
against
each
other
and
that
should
be
a
powerful
incentive
to
both
of
them
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
to
attempt
to
reach
the
solution.
now,
here
we
have
something
that
essentially
the
railway
labor
act
doesn't
give
any
of
these
mediatory
or
conciliatory
procedures
too.
we
have
an
interruption
to
commerce
that
doesn't
come
into
play
at
the
end
of
a
long
road
of
bargaining
and
mediation
and
perhaps
presidential
board.
we
had
here
an
interruption
interstate
commerce
that
started
without
warning
at
3'0
clock
in
the
morning.
now,
the
basic
answer
as
i
understand
it
of
the
respondents
to
this,
is
that
they
have
a
dispute
with
the
fec
that
they
and
the
fec
have
exhausted
the
procedures
that
the
act
provides.
and
that
therefore
they
are
free
to
use
self
help
but
from
that
proposition
they
slide
into
the
further
proposition
that
they
are
free
to
use
self
help
upon
other
carriers,
not
simply
self
help
that
is
aimed
directly
at
the
fec.
now,
that
is
--
there's
an
attempt
to
cross
over
that
by
the
proposition
that
in
strike
a
lot
of
innocent
people
get
hurt.
well,
the
reason
why
innocent
people
get
hurt
in
the
strike
is
it's
the
result
of
the
direct
pressures
that
one
party
puts
on
another
people
if
the
strike
were
successful
against
the
fec
people
who
were
dependent
on
the
fec
for
services
might
suffer.
but
the
suffering
in
the
turn
of
the
economic
screw
that's
going
on
here
is
one
that's
being
aimed
directly
at
the
coastline
and
in
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company.
and
what
the
brotherhoods
are
saying
to
those
carriers
is,
that
unless
you
embargo
the
fec,
unless
you
stop
doing
business
with
them
you'll
not
move
any
cars
through
the
jacksonville
terminal
as
far
as
the
coastline
is
concern
they're
really
saying
that
the
bottom
half
of
their
system,
the
rail
system
was
going
to
be
knocked
out.
to
the
seaboard
they
are
saying
that
an
important
part
of
your
system
going
through
duval
county
is
going
to
be
knocked
out.
it's
rather
a
strange
paradox
to
say
that
in
order
for
the
operations
of
these
carriers
to
be
closed
down
because
of
a
dispute
that
they
have
with
their
own
employees
that
there
would
have
to
be
these
procedures
mediation
and
negotiation
of
the
presidential
--
board
of
the
president
which
so
disposed
that
these
procedures
which
would
take
years
certainly
many,
many
months
and
which
would
tend
as
far
as
we're
practical
tend
to
bring
them
together
but
you'd
have
to
go
through
that
if
you
had
a
controversy
with
your
own
employees
yet
someone
else
has
a
controversy
some
other
rail
car
has
a
controversy
with
his
employees
that
you
can
be
closed
down
without
any
of
these
procedures
that
you
can
be
closed
down

in
the
morning.
the
ultimate
test
of
the
--
what
i
would
say
primarily
to
that
is
the
--
further
that
there's
more
wrong
with
that
and
in
fact
that
it
simply
paradoxical.
the
basic
fact
is
that
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company
have
never
had
any
of
the
benefit
of
these
procedures.
the
mediation
that
takes
place
between
the
florida
east
coast
and
unions
is
not
a
matter
to
which
the
carriers
that
are
concerned
here
are
parties
to
which
they
could
become
parties.
they
maybe
disposed
to
have
good
employee
relations
with
their
employees
and
indeed
the
record
shows
that
they
have
but
that
altitude
doesn't
do
them
a
bit
of
good
in
a
controversy
of
this
sort.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
there
were
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
the
fec
is
gone
further
than
that.
the
fec
is
served
to
section
6
notice
on
the
brotherhoods
as
i
understand
it
seeking
to
put
in
to
effect
to
what
they
call
uniform
working
agreements
which
is
an
agreement
draft
unilaterally
by
the
management
of
the
fec
and
which
would
permit
the
fec
to
operate
with
about
half
of
the
number
of
employees
of
the
other
carriers
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
need
to
operate.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
because
of
these
further
notices
that
the
management
of
the
fec
assert.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
these
petitioners
as
i
understand
it
were
the
defendants
in
an
injunction
suit
which
the
fec
brought
against
them
back
in
1963.
back
in
1963,
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
a
federal
court
injunction.
back
then
the
petitioners
were
concerned
there
might
be
a
violence
or
trouble
if
they
continue
to
do
business
with
the
fec
and
there
was
a
time
during
the
early
days
of
the
strike
where
i
believe
they
imposed
bargain
and
the
fec
got
a
mandatory
injunction
against
them
out
of
the
district
court,
the
middle
district
of
florida.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
concede
interchange
and
perform
their
duties
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
so,
in
the
first
place
to
have
knuckled
into
the
pickets
and
to
embargo
the
fec
would've
presumably
resulted
in
a
contempt
of
court
action.
i'm
sure
the
fec
would've
move
rather
trying
to
impose
sanctions.
the
ultimate
test
of
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
as
mr.
porter
said
the
fact
that
it
is
completely
without
limit.
this
is
not
the
only
terminal
though
there
--
it's
closer
to
the
fec's
lines
and
the
other
terminals
in
the
country.
now,
this
is
not
the
only
terminal
of
the
country
but
could
be
picketed
and
could
be
closed
down
if
as
the
respondents
contend
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
operative
here
to
bar
an
injunction.
you
can
see
the
fec's
cars
and
other
terminals
throughout
the
country.
i
see
them
at
the
atomic
yards
in
alexander
is
serving
washington
every
morning
as
i
drive
to
work.
the
--these
cars
are
carried
through
saint
louis,
carried
through
chicago
to
the
great
terminal
complex
is
there.
they
moved
there
as
part
of
a
three-carrier
or
four-carrier
interchange
but
if
those
carriers
didn't
handle
the
fec
cars
presumably
that
will
be
the
same
sort
of
pressure
put
on
the
fec.
and
under
the
basic
legal
theory
that
the
respondents
are
espousing
a
federal
district
court
would
be
equally
without
power
to
pass
an
injunction
against
interruptions
to
commerce
that
would
be
involved
to
picketing
if
any
of
these
terminals.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
--
can
certainly
its
secondary.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
they
were
inducing
them
on
a
concerted
way
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
if
it's
a
part
of
the
individual
employees,
individual
privileges
i
will
tell
from
the
story
but
just
as
if
the
amendment
themselves
decided
to
--
in
a
concerted
way
to
not
to
come
to
work
because
they
didn't
like
the
way
that
the
adjustment
board
settle
a
grievance.
they
don't
have
to
picket
in
order
to
get
injunction
in
that
circumstance.
let's
say
an
activity
is
prohibited
under
federal
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct
your
honor.
consorted
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
what
we
say
is
done,
so
much
of
an
exception
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
but
consequence
of
the
way
that
congress
has
passed
the
basic
substantive
statute
dealing
with
the
railway
labor
hearings.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
the
focus
is
essentially
that
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute
as
between
the
petitioners
on
the
one
hand.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
they
come
down
to
the
same
thing.
now,
i'm
a
littler
carried
at
the
term
secondary
activity
because
it's
terribly
loosely
used.
but
what
i
mean
is
that
you
have
conduct
of
the
sort
that
you
have
here
shutting
down
a
facility
or
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
not
this
particular
--
not
the
picketing
any
sort
of
concerted
activity
that's
aimed
at
shutting
down
one
employer's
activity
in
an
effort
to
get
him
to
put
pressure
on
other
employer.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
to
the
other
employees?
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
oh
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
suppose
there'd
be
any
problem
with
that.
you
don't
concert
it
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
you
don't
concerted
activities
among
the
labors
in
that
case
but
they
are
certainly
free
to
do
that.
if
your
honors
please,
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
initially
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
what
is
before
the
court
today
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
preliminary
injunction
that
was
issued
by
the
district
court
and
which
was
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
entertain
the
lawsuit
at
all.
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
pardon
me.
to
issue
the
injunction.
the
discussion
today
to
considerable
extent
is
gone
beyond
that
and
got
into
the
niceties
of
what
forms
of
relief
would
be
appropriate
here
in
this
to
whether
the
injunction
perhaps
should've
been
less
for
all
have
been
it
was.
this
is
the
--
as
i
understand
it
the
second
line
of
defense
of
the
respondents
here.
now,
what
we
suggest
is
properly
before
the
court
on
this
review
of
a
preliminary
injunction
like
any
review
of
preliminary
injunction
on
appeal
is
the
essential
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
passing
the
relief
which
it
passed.
there
will
be
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case
a
further
hearing
before
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
what
shape
or
what
form
the
permanent
injunctions
to
be
passed
would
take.
now,
what
we
have
undeniably
in
this
case
is
interference
with
an
enormous
volume
of
rail
traffic
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fec
what
the
pickets
carry
on
teir
signs,
the
first
words
of
that
were
“do
not
cross”,
do
not
cross
this
picket
line.
they
stopped
the
mainline
coastline
movement
that
was
coming
down
from
richmond,
virginia.
they
stopped
it
here
at
this
plaid
street
crossing.
there
were
pickets
placed
at
the
acorn
street
crossing,
it
was
only
function
is
to
carry
the
seaboard's
mainline
across
the
terminal
at
the
stockton
street
crossing
which
has
that
function
as
well
as
some
interchange
functions
and
at
the
dennis
street
crossing
where
the
only
function
of
the
coastline
to
mainline
movements.
now,
there's
some
dispute
is
to
whether
the
pickets
were
on
the
line
or
whether
they
were
ride
along
side
on
dirt
road
there.
if
there
is
any
serious
question
as
to
about
our
and
as
to
having
a
materiality
in
terms
of
relief
i
would
think
the
district
court
could
resolve
and
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
of
course
we
don't
claim
that
the
picketing
here
was
what's
called
belly
to
back
picketing
or
the
sort
of
picketing
that
physically
interrupts
commerce
what
you
have
here
is
picketing
that
induce
the
petitioner's
employees
concertedly
not
to
work
and
not
to
work
at
all
and
indeed
counsel
for
the
respondents
recognized
that.
they
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
might
someday
if
there
was
an
injunction
lead
them
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
picketing
ex
(inaudible)
or
as
the
matter
of
their
own
economic
interest
was
the
fact
that
if
the
picketing
would
do
a
way
with
a
lot
of
jobs
of
their
own
craftsman.
well,
the
reason
why
it
does
a
way
of
a
lot
of
jobs
there
that
because
it
involves
enormous
amount
of
work
throughout
the
terminal.
that
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
fec,
they
don't
want
their
crafts
members
to
handle
fec
cars
but
they
say
here,
admits
that
a
great
bulk
of
what
their
crews
do
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fec
and
that's
worth
that
they
might
let
them
continue
though
they
wanted
to
--
they
want
to
be
masters
of
whether
they
will
continue
or
not.
the
essential
point
then
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
i
believe
counsel
admitted
or
came
very
close
to
admitting
that
the
jurisdictional
question
that
the
jacksonville
terminal
is
the
same
jurisdictional
question
that
would
surround
this
if
there
were
picketing
over
this
dispute
at
atomic
yards
and
alexander
arena
if
there
were
picketing
in
richmond,
if
there
were
picketing
in
chicago,
if
there
were
picketing
in
saint
louis.
once
we
address
ourselves
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
it
doesn't
matter
how
secondary
or
how
tertiary
or
how
much
further
we
go.
we
have
the
same
issue
presented
here
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
contend
that
on
the
substantive
side,
first
that
there
is
on
the
jurisdictional
side,
we
say
that
you
have
to
read
the
norris-laguardia
act
definition
of
labor
dispute
with
the
definition
of
the
dispute
in
the
railway
labor
act.
then,
we
also
further
say
that
on
the
merits
once
we
got
passed
the
jurisdictional
question
that
the
complaint
stated
the
cause
of
action
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
way
of
removing
an
obstruction
to
the
petitioner's
duties
under
that
act
and
we
contend
that
even
though
as
we've
heard
many,
many
times
on
the
respondents
that
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
we
can
point
to
and
said
they're
flatly
broken.
i
don't
suppose
this
case
would've
been
here
if
there
were.
still
that
this
is
in
violation
of
the
general
scheme
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
only
for
seize
consorted
activities
with
respect
to
disputes
that
take
place
with
in
its
framework
between
labor
and
management
in
the
railway
industry.
now,
to
allow
very
little
further
on
one
of
the
both
on
the
question
of
the
essentially
secondary
if
i
may
use
it
in
exact
expression
make
sure
of
the
picketing
here
and
also
the
point
of
the
fact
that
we
are
getting
into
questions
that
are
characteristically
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
counsel
raised
in
fact
that
the
injunction
that
broad
enough
to
prohibit
the
picketing
at
this
point
here
which
is
where
the
fec's
cars
come
across
the
river,
st.
john
river
on
the
bridge
and
enter
the
terminal
property
caused
a
verbal
matter
it
might
to
that
i
suspect
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
was
an
exception
drafted
for
that
was
the
fact
that
the
unions
never
sought
to
picket
there
which
i
believe
emphasizes
the
essentially
secondary
again
nature
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
this
point
it's
up
to
the
fact
they're
not
directly
attempting
to
picket
the
fec's
operations
here
because
the
one
place
where
the
fec
cars
all
enter
the
terminal
and
where
all
the
moves
crossing
the
particular
point
are
fec
moves
is
right
here.
and
there's
no
effort
made
to
picket
there
which
is
most
direct
place
where
picketing
that
was
aimed
directly
against
the
fec
whether
it's
been
made.
now,
there
are
certain
physical
problems
there
but
i
don't
think
those
problems
are
in
superbly,
it's
an
overpass
and
they
could've
picket
it
on
the
overpass.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
picketed
here
what
you
have
at
the
plaid,
the
basic
activity
just
goes
on
to
plaid
is
the
mainline
movement
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
company.
but
you
will
see
an
fec
face
at
plaid
street
because
they
do
pick
up
the
cars
here
from
the
coast
line.
but
once
again
there,
the
picket
signs
said,
“do
not
cross”
and
what
happened,
the
crews
did
not
cross.
the
mainline
trains
did
not
cross
and
the
major
activity
is
that
take
place
at
that
crossing
just
like
these
relatively
minor
ones
that
have
to
do
with
the
fec.
they
were
brought
to
a
halt
as
well
as
the
activities
having
to
do
with
the
fec.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
position
that
we
take
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
is
the
position
which
the
court
recognized
in
the
chicago
river
case
about
a
decade
ago.
there,
after
quoting
from
the
legislative
of
history
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
particularly
a
dialogue
that
representative
la-guardia
had
with
representative
lincoln,
the
court
said,
we
hold
that
the
norris-la
guardia
act
cannot
be
read
alone
in
matters
dealing
with
railway
labor
disputes.
there
must
be
an
accommodation
of
that
statute
to
the
railway
labor
act.
so,
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
each
is
persevered.
we
think
that
the
purposes
of
these
acts
are
reconcilable.
with
that
in
mind,
we
turn
to
section
2
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
declares
its
purposes
as
including,
avoiding
any
interruption
to
commerce
or
to
the
operation
of
any
carrier
engaged
therein
and
also
to
provide
for
the
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes.
as
this
court
put
it,
the
meaning
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
its
purpose
is
to
channel
--
to
setup
channels
for
the
forces
of
economic
strike
in
the
railway
industry
and
the
special
processes
which
were
intended
to
compromise
them.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
procedures
are
provided
which
in
virtually
all
cases
supersede
and
replace
the
right
to
strike
and
picket.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
with
the
minor
disputes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
here,
we
have
as
between
the
florida
east
coast
and
its
brotherhoods,
there
have
been
certain
procedures.
there
have
been
the
major
dispute
procedures
which
were
setup
under
section
6
of
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
as
between
the
carriers
that
are
involved
here
today,
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
and
the
terminal
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
brotherhoods
on
the
other
who
not
only
of
course
represents
the
workers
of
the
fec
but
also
represent
the
workers
at
the
carriers
that
are
involved
here
today.
we
have
had
no
procedures
yet.
there
have
been
no
procedures
that
the
carriers
that
are
here
today
have
had
benefit
some.
it
would
be
our
position
that
if
the
brotherhoods
wish
to
attempt
to
do
what
they
did
in
morning
of
may
4
that
the
procedure
that
they
would
have
to
follow
and
we
would
not
admit
that
it's
open
to
them
but
the
procedures
that
they
would
follow
to
test
whether
they
could
generate
a
dispute
between
these
carriers
and
themselves
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
would
be
to
file
section
6
notices
and
to
take
the
position
that
the
agreements
between
these
carriers
and
themselves
relating
to
the
work
practices
within
the
terminal
area
should
be
revised
to
provide
that
their
employees
for
the
man
in
the
crafts
that
they
represent
would
not
be
required
to
touch
fec
cars.
now,
the
brotherhoods
haven't
initiated
any
such
procedures.
i
would
like
to
make
very
clear
that
they
were
to
institute
them
that
would
be
in
the
first
instance
the
position
of
the
carriers
that
this
is
not
a
bargainable
matter
under
section
6.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
their
signs
represented
a
referred
to
the
major
dispute
with
the
fec.
however,
the
first
words
that
appears
--
the
first
words
of
exhortation
to
the
workers
were
“do
not
cross.”
it
went
on
to
say
do
not
assist
the
fec
but
the
first
words
on
the
sign
were
“do
not
cross”
and
what
happens
was
that
the
brotherhoods,
the
men
in
the
trains,
the
man
on
foot
did
not
cross.
there
was
a
train
that
came
down
from
richmond,
virginia
that
arrived
in
the
early
daylight
of
powers
on
the
atlantic
coast
line
mainline
and
it
was
stopped
by
picketing
at
the
quaid
street.
an
interruption
of
the
mainline
movement
or
movement
there
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fec.
what
we
suggest
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
dialogue
between
representative
la-guardia
and
representative
lincoln
we
think
it's
very
revealing.
congressman
la-guardia
said,
the
“railroad
labor
act
takes
care
of
the
whole
labor
situation
pertaining
to
the
railroads.
they
could
not
possibly
come
under
this
for
the
reason
that
we
provided
the
machinery
there
for
settling
labor
disputes.”
now,
our
position
is
that
if
there
is
a
dispute,
if
there
is
controversy
to
which
the
procedures
of
the
act
do
not
relate
then
congress
did
not
intend
that
to
be
recognized
as
a
labor
dispute
in
the
rail
industry
and
its
intention
there
was
that
commerce
should
go
on.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
contend
that
there
is
a
controversy
of
a
commercial
nature.
it
may
be
that
they
are
taking
the
position
that
their
men
should
not
handle
the
fec
cars
within
the
terminal.
they
have
rather
of
course
phrase
it
in
terms
of
the
commercial
controversies
that
they
don't
wish
the
railroad
managements
to
do
business
with
the
fec.
now,
the
carriers
to
be
the
way
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
have
a
dispute
with
the
florida
east
coast.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
apparently
have
a
controversy
with
our
clients.
they're
asking
--
they're
asking
our
client
to
do
something
that
are
--
our
client
is
on
the
position
to
do
and
there
are
proceedings
as
far
as
economic
gloss
against
our
clients
if
they
don't
do
it.
and
to
me,
that's
a
controversy.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
we
have
first
take
that
position
whether
our
position
is
right
as
a
matter
that
would
have
to
be
decided.
our
position
would
be
first
that
this
is
essentially
commercial
controversy
both
the
purposes
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
for
purposes
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
which
has
to
be
read
with
the
railway
labor
act
in
railway
labor
matters
and
that
equally
for
the
same
reason
that
the
norris-la
guardia
act
does
not
prohibit
an
injunction
here
against
the
commercial
pressures
that
are
sought
to
be
put
on
that
a
section
6
norris
could
not
be
proper.
however,
if
it
turned
out
that
the
section
6
notice
was
proper
and
this
raised
a
bargainable
issue,
we
would
then
have
the
situation
that
presented
this
court
--
was
presented
to
this
court
in
the
la
guardia
case
where
this
court
held
that
only
at
the
end
of
the
line
if
the
procedures
were
exhausted
or
if
the
carrier
refused
to
bargain
with
be
norris-la
guardia
act
come
into
play.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
for
that
situation,
our
basic
position
your
honor
is
that
there
is
not
a
labor
dispute
between
the
coastline
and
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
unions
on
the
other
that
there
is
a
commercial
controversy
and
that
the
unions
desire
the
railroad
to
embargo
the
fec.
if
however,
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
that
and
there
is
the
start
of
a
labor
dispute
here,
i
don't
think
there
are
actually
could
be
a
labor
dispute
started
until
the
union's
channel
into
that
procedure
until
they
serve
the
section
6
notice
which
they
haven't
done.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
in
that
light
of
that
your
honor,
if
that's
--
if
that
remains
their
position
then
they
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
those
circumstances
would
be
the
--
the
only
circumstances
under
which
the
actual
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
could
be
followed
here.
the
accommodation
that
we
are
essentially
urging
this
court
to
make
between
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
norris-la
guardia
act
relates
to
the
definition
of
dispute
in
those
two
acts.
and
we
urge
the
court
to
follow
the
same
definition
of
dispute
in
the
two
acts
and
to
harmonize
the
two
statutes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
our
position
on
that
is
this
your
honor.
first,
there
is
no
labor
dispute
certainly
here
on
the
ordinary
sense.
there's
no
controversy
as
to
the
wages
or
hours
or
working
conditions
of
the
employees
of
the
seaboard
or
the
coastline
or
the
terminal
company.
there
is
a
however
a
commercial
controversy.
there's
obviously
controversy
here
between
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
and
the
terminal
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
unions
on
the
other.
the
unions
are
putting
crosier
upon
the
three
carriers
to
do
something
that
the
carriers
are
not
in
the
position
to
do
and
they
are
proceeding
to
disrupt
their
commerce
if
they
don't
do
it.
that's
the
sort
of
controversy
that
exists
here.
what
i'm
suggesting
however
is
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
congress
in
passing
the
railway
labor
act
in
short
never
--
never
dreamed
that
unions
would
resort
to
a
tactic
of
the
sort
involved
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
essentially
our
position
your
honor
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
court
has
to
take
the
two
we
suggest
to
take
a
two
statutes
together
and
give
them
a
harmonizing
reading
between
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
believe
in
just
to
try
to
do
this
before.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
besides
i
think
if
we
go
back
in
to
history
there
probably
before
the
adjustment
boards
were
setup
and
certainly
before
the
‘34
act
where
the
procedures
of
the
adjustment
board
were
made
mandatory.
i
believe
that
there
were
localized
strikes
over
grievances
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
those
are
generally
been
on
more
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
a
broader
basis.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
there's
never
been
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
know
of
any
case
and
which
either
on
grievance
in
the
334
era
where
there
was
an
attempt
to
impose
the
secondary
boycott
of
this
sort
in
order
to
put
pressure
on
the
carrier
that
have
grievance.
so,
i
think
this
is
unprecedented--
as
a
factual
matter
because
this
tactic
has
not
been
used
by
unions.
as
i've
said
they
may
well
in
the
early
areas
have
been
opportunities
to
use
it.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
it's
quite
clear
under
the
cases
interpreting
the
proviso
to
section
84
as
this
court
said
in
one
of
the
cases
have
been
decided
in
the
60's.
i
--
here,
there
was
no
effort
made
to
minimize
the
effect
of
the
picketing
upon
the
unrelated
operations
of
the
innocent
employers.
what
we
have
here
is
a
surrounding
of
the
perimeter
of
the
terminal
company
including
places
where
their
only
mainline
moves
and
the
closing
down
of
all
movements,
not
simply
movements
that
have
something
to
do
with
the
fec.
it
isn't
like
the
cases
where
you
have
a
railroad
delivering
cars
to
an
industry
and
the
industry
is
struck
where
the
picketing
is
applied
at
that
point
which
might
beyond
the
railroads
own
property
but
where
the
effect
can
be
limited.
here,
the
effect
is
not
limited
and
this
appears
to
the
case
for
this
held
not
sort
case
sought
not
to
be
saved
by
the
proviso.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct
your
honor
and
actually
the
consequences
of
having
the
price
of
further
experience
would
have
been
pretty
dear.
for
one
thing
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
if
the
very
day
that
mail
facility
at
the
terminal
was
shutdown
and
it
would
take
six
days
to
catch
up
and
that
was
the
testimony
that
was
given
in
the
light
of
the
monday
closing
and
the
--
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
industrial
users
in
duval
county
would
be
cut
off
and
before
the
effects
of
the
strike
beyond
if
they
felt
throughout
all
the
peninsular
florida.
this
is
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
that
goes
through
these
premises
that
is
one
main
carriers
that
serves
between
this
part
of
the
country
and
in
florida
has
also
a
principle
line
of
the
seaboard
that
was
closed
down
by
this
picketing.
and
the
--
and
neither
the
facts
of
these
were
quite
clear
indication
of
what
the
effects
would
have
been
if
the
striking
or
picketing
if
the
picketing
went
on.
the
--
to
make
a
first
case
that
this
court
decided
back
in
1960,
we
think
those
are
clear
indication
of
the
way
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
meant
to
operate
in
the
railway
labor
field.
the
way
it
operates
is
that
when
two
parties
are
locked
in
a
major
dispute
something
for
which
the
act
provides
procedures
but
norris-laguardia
act
tells
them
that
down
at
the
end
of
the
road
that
they're
traveling
the
road
of
negotiation
and
mediation
if
they
can
settle
that
dispute
through
those
processes
that
the
law
is
going
to
leave
them
free
to
use
economic
warfare
against
each
other
and
that
should
be
a
powerful
incentive
to
both
of
them
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
to
attempt
to
reach
the
solution.
now,
here
we
have
something
that
essentially
the
railway
labor
act
doesn't
give
any
of
these
mediatory
or
conciliatory
procedures
too.
we
have
an
interruption
to
commerce
that
doesn't
come
into
play
at
the
end
of
a
long
road
of
bargaining
and
mediation
and
perhaps
presidential
board.
we
had
here
an
interruption
interstate
commerce
that
started
without
warning
at
3'0
clock
in
the
morning.
now,
the
basic
answer
as
i
understand
it
of
the
respondents
to
this,
is
that
they
have
a
dispute
with
the
fec
that
they
and
the
fec
have
exhausted
the
procedures
that
the
act
provides.
and
that
therefore
they
are
free
to
use
self
help
but
from
that
proposition
they
slide
into
the
further
proposition
that
they
are
free
to
use
self
help
upon
other
carriers,
not
simply
self
help
that
is
aimed
directly
at
the
fec.
now,
that
is
--
there's
an
attempt
to
cross
over
that
by
the
proposition
that
in
strike
a
lot
of
innocent
people
get
hurt.
well,
the
reason
why
innocent
people
get
hurt
in
the
strike
is
it's
the
result
of
the
direct
pressures
that
one
party
puts
on
another
people
if
the
strike
were
successful
against
the
fec
people
who
were
dependent
on
the
fec
for
services
might
suffer.
but
the
suffering
in
the
turn
of
the
economic
screw
that's
going
on
here
is
one
that's
being
aimed
directly
at
the
coastline
and
in
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company.
and
what
the
brotherhoods
are
saying
to
those
carriers
is,
that
unless
you
embargo
the
fec,
unless
you
stop
doing
business
with
them
you'll
not
move
any
cars
through
the
jacksonville
terminal
as
far
as
the
coastline
is
concern
they're
really
saying
that
the
bottom
half
of
their
system,
the
rail
system
was
going
to
be
knocked
out.
to
the
seaboard
they
are
saying
that
an
important
part
of
your
system
going
through
duval
county
is
going
to
be
knocked
out.
it's
rather
a
strange
paradox
to
say
that
in
order
for
the
operations
of
these
carriers
to
be
closed
down
because
of
a
dispute
that
they
have
with
their
own
employees
that
there
would
have
to
be
these
procedures
mediation
and
negotiation
of
the
presidential
--
board
of
the
president
which
so
disposed
that
these
procedures
which
would
take
years
certainly
many,
many
months
and
which
would
tend
as
far
as
we're
practical
tend
to
bring
them
together
but
you'd
have
to
go
through
that
if
you
had
a
controversy
with
your
own
employees
yet
someone
else
has
a
controversy
some
other
rail
car
has
a
controversy
with
his
employees
that
you
can
be
closed
down
without
any
of
these
procedures
that
you
can
be
closed
down
3
o'clock
in
the
morning.
the
ultimate
test
of
the
--
what
i
would
say
primarily
to
that
is
the
--
further
that
there's
more
wrong
with
that
and
in
fact
that
it
simply
paradoxical.
the
basic
fact
is
that
the
coastline,
the
seaboard
and
the
terminal
company
have
never
had
any
of
the
benefit
of
these
procedures.
the
mediation
that
takes
place
between
the
florida
east
coast
and
unions
is
not
a
matter
to
which
the
carriers
that
are
concerned
here
are
parties
to
which
they
could
become
parties.
they
maybe
disposed
to
have
good
employee
relations
with
their
employees
and
indeed
the
record
shows
that
they
have
but
that
altitude
doesn't
do
them
a
bit
of
good
in
a
controversy
of
this
sort.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
there
were
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
the
fec
is
gone
further
than
that.
the
fec
is
served
to
section
6
notice
on
the
brotherhoods
as
i
understand
it
seeking
to
put
in
to
effect
to
what
they
call
uniform
working
agreements
which
is
an
agreement
draft
unilaterally
by
the
management
of
the
fec
and
which
would
permit
the
fec
to
operate
with
about
half
of
the
number
of
employees
of
the
other
carriers
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
need
to
operate.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
because
of
these
further
notices
that
the
management
of
the
fec
assert.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
these
petitioners
as
i
understand
it
were
the
defendants
in
an
injunction
suit
which
the
fec
brought
against
them
back
in
1963.
back
in
1963,
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
a
federal
court
injunction.
back
then
the
petitioners
were
concerned
there
might
be
a
violence
or
trouble
if
they
continue
to
do
business
with
the
fec
and
there
was
a
time
during
the
early
days
of
the
strike
where
i
believe
they
imposed
bargain
and
the
fec
got
a
mandatory
injunction
against
them
out
of
the
district
court,
the
middle
district
of
florida.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
concede
interchange
and
perform
their
duties
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
so,
in
the
first
place
to
have
knuckled
into
the
pickets
and
to
embargo
the
fec
would've
presumably
resulted
in
a
contempt
of
court
action.
i'm
sure
the
fec
would've
move
rather
trying
to
impose
sanctions.
the
ultimate
test
of
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
as
mr.
porter
said
the
fact
that
it
is
completely
without
limit.
this
is
not
the
only
terminal
though
there
--
it's
closer
to
the
fec's
lines
and
the
other
terminals
in
the
country.
now,
this
is
not
the
only
terminal
of
the
country
but
could
be
picketed
and
could
be
closed
down
if
as
the
respondents
contend
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
operative
here
to
bar
an
injunction.
you
can
see
the
fec's
cars
and
other
terminals
throughout
the
country.
i
see
them
at
the
atomic
yards
in
alexander
is
serving
washington
every
morning
as
i
drive
to
work.
the
--these
cars
are
carried
through
saint
louis,
carried
through
chicago
to
the
great
terminal
complex
is
there.
they
moved
there
as
part
of
a
three-carrier
or
four-carrier
interchange
but
if
those
carriers
didn't
handle
the
fec
cars
presumably
that
will
be
the
same
sort
of
pressure
put
on
the
fec.
and
under
the
basic
legal
theory
that
the
respondents
are
espousing
a
federal
district
court
would
be
equally
without
power
to
pass
an
injunction
against
interruptions
to
commerce
that
would
be
involved
to
picketing
if
any
of
these
terminals.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
--
can
certainly
its
secondary.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
they
were
inducing
them
on
a
concerted
way
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
if
it's
a
part
of
the
individual
employees,
individual
privileges
i
will
tell
from
the
story
but
just
as
if
the
amendment
themselves
decided
to
--
in
a
concerted
way
to
not
to
come
to
work
because
they
didn't
like
the
way
that
the
adjustment
board
settle
a
grievance.
they
don't
have
to
picket
in
order
to
get
injunction
in
that
circumstance.
let's
say
an
activity
is
prohibited
under
federal
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct
your
honor.
consorted
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
what
we
say
is
done,
so
much
of
an
exception
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
but
consequence
of
the
way
that
congress
has
passed
the
basic
substantive
statute
dealing
with
the
railway
labor
hearings.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
the
focus
is
essentially
that
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute
as
between
the
petitioners
on
the
one
hand.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
they
come
down
to
the
same
thing.
now,
i'm
a
littler
carried
at
the
term
secondary
activity
because
it's
terribly
loosely
used.
but
what
i
mean
is
that
you
have
conduct
of
the
sort
that
you
have
here
shutting
down
a
facility
or
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
not
this
particular
--
not
the
picketing
any
sort
of
concerted
activity
that's
aimed
at
shutting
down
one
employer's
activity
in
an
effort
to
get
him
to
put
pressure
on
other
employer.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
to
the
other
employees?
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
oh
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
suppose
there'd
be
any
problem
with
that.
you
don't
concert
it
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
you
don't
concerted
activities
among
the
labors
in
that
case
but
they
are
certainly
free
to
do
that.
if
your
honors
please,
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
initially
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
what
is
before
the
court
today
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
preliminary
injunction
that
was
issued
by
the
district
court
and
which
was
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
entertain
the
lawsuit
at
all.
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
pardon
me.
to
issue
the
injunction.
the
discussion
today
to
considerable
extent
is
gone
beyond
that
and
got
into
the
niceties
of
what
forms
of
relief
would
be
appropriate
here
in
this
to
whether
the
injunction
perhaps
should've
been
less
for
all
have
been
it
was.
this
is
the
--
as
i
understand
it
the
second
line
of
defense
of
the
respondents
here.
now,
what
we
suggest
is
properly
before
the
court
on
this
review
of
a
preliminary
injunction
like
any
review
of
preliminary
injunction
on
appeal
is
the
essential
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
passing
the
relief
which
it
passed.
there
will
be
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case
a
further
hearing
before
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
what
shape
or
what
form
the
permanent
injunctions
to
be
passed
would
take.
now,
what
we
have
undeniably
in
this
case
is
interference
with
an
enormous
volume
of
rail
traffic
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fec
what
the
pickets
carry
on
teir
signs,
the
first
words
of
that
were
“do
not
cross”,
do
not
cross
this
picket
line.
they
stopped
the
mainline
coastline
movement
that
was
coming
down
from
richmond,
virginia.
they
stopped
it
here
at
this
plaid
street
crossing.
there
were
pickets
placed
at
the
acorn
street
crossing,
it
was
only
function
is
to
carry
the
seaboard's
mainline
across
the
terminal
at
the
stockton
street
crossing
which
has
that
function
as
well
as
some
interchange
functions
and
at
the
dennis
street
crossing
where
the
only
function
of
the
coastline
to
mainline
movements.
now,
there's
some
dispute
is
to
whether
the
pickets
were
on
the
line
or
whether
they
were
ride
along
side
on
dirt
road
there.
if
there
is
any
serious
question
as
to
about
our
and
as
to
having
a
materiality
in
terms
of
relief
i
would
think
the
district
court
could
resolve
and
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
of
course
we
don't
claim
that
the
picketing
here
was
what's
called
belly
to
back
picketing
or
the
sort
of
picketing
that
physically
interrupts
commerce
what
you
have
here
is
picketing
that
induce
the
petitioner's
employees
concertedly
not
to
work
and
not
to
work
at
all
and
indeed
counsel
for
the
respondents
recognized
that.
they
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
might
someday
if
there
was
an
injunction
lead
them
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
picketing
ex
(inaudible)
or
as
the
matter
of
their
own
economic
interest
was
the
fact
that
if
the
picketing
would
do
a
way
with
a
lot
of
jobs
of
their
own
craftsman.
well,
the
reason
why
it
does
a
way
of
a
lot
of
jobs
there
that
because
it
involves
enormous
amount
of
work
throughout
the
terminal.
that
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
fec,
they
don't
want
their
crafts
members
to
handle
fec
cars
but
they
say
here,
admits
that
a
great
bulk
of
what
their
crews
do
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
fec
and
that's
worth
that
they
might
let
them
continue
though
they
wanted
to
--
they
want
to
be
masters
of
whether
they
will
continue
or
not.
the
essential
point
then
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
i
believe
counsel
admitted
or
came
very
close
to
admitting
that
the
jurisdictional
question
that
the
jacksonville
terminal
is
the
same
jurisdictional
question
that
would
surround
this
if
there
were
picketing
over
this
dispute
at
atomic
yards
and
alexander
arena
if
there
were
picketing
in
richmond,
if
there
were
picketing
in
chicago,
if
there
were
picketing
in
saint
louis.
once
we
address
ourselves
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
it
doesn't
matter
how
secondary
or
how
tertiary
or
how
much
further
we
go.
we
have
the
same
issue
presented
here
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
contend
that
on
the
substantive
side,
first
that
there
is
on
the
jurisdictional
side,
we
say
that
you
have
to
read
the
norris-laguardia
act
definition
of
labor
dispute
with
the
definition
of
the
dispute
in
the
railway
labor
act.
then,
we
also
further
say
that
on
the
merits
once
we
got
passed
the
jurisdictional
question
that
the
complaint
stated
the
cause
of
action
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
way
of
removing
an
obstruction
to
the
petitioner's
duties
under
that
act
and
we
contend
that
even
though
as
we've
heard
many,
many
times
on
the
respondents
that
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
we
can
point
to
and
said
they're
flatly
broken.
i
don't
suppose
this
case
would've
been
here
if
there
were.
still
that
this
is
in
violation
of
the
general
scheme
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
only
for
seize
consorted
activities
with
respect
to
disputes
that
take
place
with
in
its
framework
between
labor
and
management
in
the
railway
industry.
now,
to
allow
very
little
further
on
one
of
the
both
on
the
question
of
the
essentially
secondary
if
i
may
use
it
in
exact
expression
make
sure
of
the
picketing
here
and
also
the
point
of
the
fact
that
we
are
getting
into
questions
that
are
characteristically
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
counsel
raised
in
fact
that
the
injunction
that
broad
enough
to
prohibit
the
picketing
at
this
point
here
which
is
where
the
fec's
cars
come
across
the
river,
st.
john
river
on
the
bridge
and
enter
the
terminal
property
caused
a
verbal
matter
it
might
to
that
i
suspect
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
was
an
exception
drafted
for
that
was
the
fact
that
the
unions
never
sought
to
picket
there
which
i
believe
emphasizes
the
essentially
secondary
again
nature
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
this
point
it's
up
to
the
fact
they're
not
directly
attempting
to
picket
the
fec's
operations
here
because
the
one
place
where
the
fec
cars
all
enter
the
terminal
and
where
all
the
moves
crossing
the
particular
point
are
fec
moves
is
right
here.
and
there's
no
effort
made
to
picket
there
which
is
most
direct
place
where
picketing
that
was
aimed
directly
against
the
fec
whether
it's
been
made.
now,
there
are
certain
physical
problems
there
but
i
don't
think
those
problems
are
in
superbly,
it's
an
overpass
and
they
could've
picket
it
on
the
overpass.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
picketed
here
what
you
have
at
the
plaid,
the
basic
activity
just
goes
on
to
plaid
is
the
mainline
movement
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
company.
but
you
will
see
an
fec
face
at
plaid
street
because
they
do
pick
up
the
cars
here
from
the
coast
line.
but
once
again
there,
the
picket
signs
said,
“do
not
cross”
and
what
happened,
the
crews
did
not
cross.
the
mainline
trains
did
not
cross
and
the
major
activity
is
that
take
place
at
that
crossing
just
like
these
relatively
minor
ones
that
have
to
do
with
the
fec.
they
were
brought
to
a
halt
as
well
as
the
activities
having
to
do
with
the
fec.
thank
you
your
honor.
