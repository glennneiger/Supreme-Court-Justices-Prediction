justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
where's
the
so
called
fec
gate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bay
and
stewart?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
notice
in
this
map
for
a
bay
and
riverside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
where
was
it
with
respect
to
the
intersection
of
bay
and
river
side
and
the
bay
in
stewart
bay
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
as
you
look
at
the
map?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
left.
far
left?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
between
the
park
then
and
riverside?
you
know
this
part
and
the
riverside
seemed
parallel
in
one
another?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
between
myrtle
and
park?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
about
where
the
words
sta
tracks?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
we
can't
just
--
could
you
pinpoint
with
relation
to
one
of
those
red
marks
on
that
line
of
ridge
station
tracks.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
going
left?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
as
i
recall
it
a
restrain
of
picketing
except
that
the
fec
gave,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i'm
speaking
at
the
terminal
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
restraint
ran
against
every
place
marked
here
as
location
of
pickets
except
the
fec
gate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
see
mr.
lyons,
we
were
dealing
in
cargo
river
with
minor
disputes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
which
congress
had
provided
a
terminal
procedure
in
effect
in
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
that
here,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
pickets
represent
that
they're
signs
or
otherwise
what
dispute
it
was
the
location
of
their
picket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
essence
what
you're
saying
is
that
mr.
lyons
that
neither
the
railway
labor
act
nor
the
norris-laguardia
act
deals
with
this
dispute
that
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute
under
either
act
but
a
commercial
dispute
and
in
consequence
equity
is
free
to
deal
with
it
as
you
as
have
to
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lyons
does
these
petitioners
among
the
road
for
the
excepted
the
national
setting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
issue
between
fec
and
the
brotherhood
this
proof
is
that
fec
has
not
accepted
the
national
setting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
to
that
extent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
brotherhoods
dispute
for
the
fec
is
different
from
the
national
dispute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
do
i
see
somewhere
in
this
record
with
these
petitioners
had
an
injunction
against
the
non-operating
union
against
interference
of
interchange?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
federal
or
a
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
mr.
lyons
it
would
be
further,
if
you
focus
on
secondary
activity
or
is
your
focus
on
this
is
not
a
labor
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
legality
point,
is
that
the
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
example
could
chicago
be
one
of
those
places?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rutledge,
we
now
know
where
that
fec
gate
is,
how
many
employees
on
the
fec
payroll,
does
the
record
indicate
work
in
terminal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
must
indicate
that
there
are
some
fec
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
just
told
justice
white
that
the
distinction
you
draw
between
chicago
situation
in
this
is
that
fec
operates
with
its
own
personnel
a
number
of
the
activity
within
the
terminal
then
surely
then
the
record
just
tell
us
what
the
number
--
who
the
fec
personnel
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
they're
just
a
train
crew?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
all
fec
has
working
in
the
train?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
the
record
show
the
fec
has
an
office
or
any
kind
in
the
terminal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
switching
is
there
anything
in
the
record
--
switching
equipment,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
fec
switching
equipment
in
the
terminal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
by
--
not
by
fec
employees
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
acts
to
interchange
is
done
by
those
on
the
train
who
came
into
that
area,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyway
mr.
rutledge
as
i
understand
it
the
panel
of
your
argument
is
you
have
no
dispute
with
this
section
in
any
sense
if
it
requires
section
6.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
real
dispute
is
with
fec
and
that
derive
from
it
is
the
authority
legally
to
put
the
questions
you
are
on
these
petitioners
and
that
you're
protected
by
norris-laguardia
against
the
injunction
against
that
kind.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
specifically
to
that
to
do
kind
of
operation
that
goes
on
to
jacksonville
namely
of
fec
train
with
fec
crews
coming
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
you
don't
have
it
in
chicago
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
mr.
rutledge
i
don't
quite
understand
why
the
principle
has
any
different
depending
upon
whether
fec
crews
goes
to
the
terminal
or
not.
why
should
that
be
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
if
you
prevail
what
--
what's
the
position
of
the
petitioners
when
respect
to
an
injunction
that
fec
get
against?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rutledge,
if
the
atlantic
coast
line
had
a
separate
terminal
through
which
if
through
train
went
and
the
atlantic
coast
line
used
this
terminal
only
for
purpose
of
interchange
with
fec
and
other
railroads,
you
wouldn't
claim
the
rights
to
go
and
picket
atlantic
coast
line
separate
terminal,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
petitioners
would
embargo
all
fec's
staff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
want
--
you
want
them
to
stop
handling
any
fec
interchange?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
an
embargo?
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
rutledge
even
if
you
we're
not
here
don't
you
have
a
--
the
most
identical
state
court
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you
said
now,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
where's
the
so
called
fec
gate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
