justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
answer
to
your
suggestion
that
the
union
could've
filed
another
under
section
6,
isn't
it?
there's
no
dispute
between
the
brotherhoods
and
the
--
and
your
client,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
dispute
is
with
the
florida
east
coast.
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
none
with
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
not
a
--
but
i
think
you
said
that
your
clients
themselves
would
respond
in
case
of
notices
filed
under
section
6
that
this
was
not
a
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
that
section.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they're
not
going
to
you
because
they
--
their
position
is
identically
to
yours.
they
don't
claim
any
dispute
with
your
clients,
any
labor
dispute.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
their
position
but
i
didn't
think
that
they
had
or
that
they
claim
to
have
any
labor
dispute
with
your
carriers.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
a
non-presented
situation
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
fact
is
that
historically
there's
been
industry-wide
bargaining
and
an
industry-wide
settlements
or
at
least
regional
in
a
railroad
industry
and
there
was
against
that
background
that
this
legislature
was
enacted
and
that
congress
obviously
didn't
foresee
the
possibility
of
this
congress
situation
arising,
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
over
--
not
rates
of
pay
and
wages
and
working
conditions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
potter
stewart
of
grievances
was
on
a
property
of
an
individual
carrier
but
i'm
talking
about
major
industry.
justice
potter
stewart
an
industry-wide
bargaining
and
industry-wide
settlements
--
justice
potter
stewart
they're
requiring
them
to
interchange
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
--
wouldn't
you
--
am
i
entirely
wrong
in
thinking
that
this
as
a
factual
matter
is
rather
unprecedented
in
the
railroad
industry
because
isn't
it
--
am
i
not
correct
in
thinking
that
railroad
labor
disputes
are
generally
settled
on
an
industry-wide
phases
and
that
was
true
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
passed,
national
labor
act.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
regional.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
you're
talking
now
about
your
dispute
with
somebody
is
not
a
party
to
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
doesn't
that
--
isn't
that
true
all
of
the
country
in
compass
places,
every
time
there's
an
interchange
of
east
coast
car
they're
doing
business
with
another
carrier?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
talking
about
that
place.
my
point
are
there
not
countless
places
where
the
florida
east
coast
railway
in
conducting
its
business
so
long
as
it
is
operating
does
business
with
other
carriers
every
time
there's
an
interchange
of
the
car
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
from
that
railroad
to
another
in
any
places
in
the
country
as
they're
going
on
business
between
the
two
railroads.
justice
potter
stewart
in
yards
the
terminal
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
perhaps
there's
more
that
goes
on
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
that's
not
the
place,
there
are
many
places.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
can
run
it
from
the
statute
not
upon
--
it
depends
on
a
derivatively
upon
the
industry.
there's
a
particularized
statute
for
the
garment
industry,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
response
to
the
particular
peculiarized
need
to
that
industry
but
it's
the
statute,
it's
not
any
court-made
exception.
justice
potter
stewart
the
exceptions,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
done
by
the
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
look
just
to
the
language
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
nothing
else
in
chicago
river
case
would
not
and
could
not
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
--
the
relative
lines
of
defense
of
your
argument
to
be
that
if
we're
persuaded
that
you're
right
about
the
norris-laguardia
act
effect
in
taking
away
any
power
of
the
federal
court
to
issue
an
injunction
in
this
case
that
--
then
that's
true
whether
or
not
this
is
secondary
boycott,
isn't
that
--
that
is
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
put
them
in
summary
in
a
different
order
but
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
i
so
understand
it
that
if
you're
right
about
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
is
true
even
if
this
is
a
boycott
which
would
be
illegal
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
an
industry
affected
by
that
act?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
do
i
understand
it
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
the
logic
of
your
argument
also
say
that
there
could
be
an
injunction
there
by
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
right
mr.
rutledge
that
you're
under
no
--
there's
no
incentive
at
all
for
you
to
limit
the
impact
of
what
you're
doing
if
you're
right
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
then
say
a
federal
courts
from
enjoining
anything,
whatever
you
want.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that's
what
you
are
doing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
the
preemptive
issue
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
duties
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
also
aren't
they
are
carriers?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
case
of
last
term
involving
this
railroad
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
predecessor
in
this
tribunal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
referring
to
the
train
particularly
to
that
case
with
rule
as
to
my
question
as
to
the
duties
of
railroads
--
of
carriers
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
operate
wasn't
this
some
of
lines
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
that
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
whole
grab
bag
of
sometimes
inconsistent
statutes,
that
statutes
is
one
of
that
to
be
thrown
into
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
to
issue
an
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
answer
to
your
suggestion
that
the
union
could've
filed
another
under

isn't
it?
there's
no
