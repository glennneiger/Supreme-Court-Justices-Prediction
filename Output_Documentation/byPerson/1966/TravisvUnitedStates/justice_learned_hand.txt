mr.
justice
learned
hand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
yesterday,
before
the
recess,
the
chief
justice
asked
me
whether
or
what
the
police
of
the
department
of
state
was
with
regard
to
newsman
traveling
to
areas
on
which
geographic
restrictions
had
been
imposed
by
the
department.
i’ve
been
advised
that
at
least
since
1957
it
has
been
the
unexceptional
rule
that
these
departments
apply
in
all
cases
that
bonafide
newsman
representing
the
established
news
media
will
be
given
authority
on
request
to
travel
on
these
areas.
prior
to
1957,
that
was
the
rule
as
to
all
areas
other
than
communist
china.
and
as
far
as
communist
china
is
concerned,
travel
was
almost
completely
restricted
to
that
particular
country.
returning
just
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
on
his
face,
our
contention,
our
view
that
section
1185’s
provision
that
a
traveler
departing
the
united
states
must
do
so
with
a
valid
passport
includes
in
that
rule.
the
fact
that
the
passport
must
be
valid
to
the
country
for
which
he
is
going
is
based
not
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
so
said
and
has
applied
that
rule
as
it
were
extraneously
to
a
passport.
we
think
that
the
destination
of
a
traveler
is
really
of
the
very
essence
of
what
a
passport
has
historically
has
been.
the
fact
is
that,
the
historical
function
of
the
passport
has
this
court
recognized
just
long
ago
was
ersytechqui
vs.
darse
in
9
peters
is,
as
the
document
addressed
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
the
government
of
far
nations,
advising
them
that
the
bearer
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
requesting
that
he
be
granted
courtesy
and
safe
travel
in
that
foreign
country.
if
a
passport
is
not
valid
and
it’s
so
marked
as
being
“not
valid”
to
a
particular
country,
it
is
in
effect
no
communication
to
that
country.
it’s
not
the
secretary
of
the
state
addressing
the
responsible
officials
there.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
think
the
first
area
restriction
was
really
imposed
way
back
in
1915
or
really
1914
with
regard
to
--
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
i
when
–
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
would
like
to
develop
may
be
more
so
on
the
succeeding
case
really
the
fact
that
there
was
a
criminal
penalty.
the
problem
so
far
is
the
administration
of
the
statute
is
involved,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
other
side
of
the
fact
that
they
were
in
effect
two
criminal
statutes
enacted
both
of
which
cover
various
forms
of
violation
of
area
restriction.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
yes,
but
it
is
a
substantial
re-enactment
of
the
statute
passed
first
on
1918
and
then
in
1941,
both
dealing
specifically
with
war
time
situation.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
no.
there
had
been
a
substantial
series
of
bills,
the
travis
brief,
the
petitioners
brief
in
this
case
cites
almost
30
which
were
introduced
between
the
85th
congress
and
this
past
congress.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
would
say
very
likely
the
reason
why
is
that,
the
congress
may
be
does
not
want
to
go
further
than
existing
legislation
in
that
area.
and
i
think
also
realistically
of
there
are
all
sorts
of
statutes
that
enter
into
why
a
bill
wasn’t
passed.
i
think
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
the
fact
that
congress
doesn’t
pass
the
bill
is
no
indication
of
a
legislative
intent.
but
i
do
think,
if
it
were
true
that
the
bills
proposed
did
no
more
than
the,
we
say
the
existing
law,
does
then
i
think
there
would
be
substance
to
petitioner’s
argument
that
the
proposal
of
those
bills
was
an
indication
that
the
departments
involved
believed
that
that
existing
legislation
didn’t
cover
this
problem.
but
the
fact
is,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
proposed
bills
do
substantially
more
than
existing
law
does.
under
existing
law
there
were
two
criminal
statutes
involved,
one
is
18
usc
1544
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
a
passport
in
violation
of
its
conditions.
and
that
was
enacted
in
1917;
the
second
criminal
statute
involve
is
the
statute
involved
here,
section
1185.
what
those
two
statutes
require
is
proof
under
1544
of
use
of
the
passport
which
is
generally
not
true
in
cases
of
travel
to
countries
which
we
have
no
diplomatic
relations
because
in
the
passports
it’s
not
just
used
in
order
to
enter
that
country.
and
what
this
statute
require,
the
present
statute,
1185,
is
proof
of
an
intent
to
go
to
that
country
at
the
time
of
departure.
now,
a
petitioner
contend
that
the
fact
that
they’ve
been
close
to
600
violations
of
area
restrictions
prior
to
the
bringing
of
these
prosecutions
indicates
that
the
department
of
state
did
not
believe
or
the
department
of
state
in
justice
did
not
believe
that
this
was
a
criminal
statute
that
was
applicable.
but
the
fact
is,
this
statute
applies
to
a
very
few
cases.
it
applies
only
to
cases
where
we
can
prove
intent
as
of
the
time
of
departure.
now,
that’s
very
difficult
when
you’re
dealing
with
travel,
let’s
say
to
communist
china.
we
can’t
prove
that
the
man,
who
travels
to
communist
china,
was
ordinarily
has
that
intent
at
the
time
he
departs
the
united
states
and
because
of
the
problems
of
proof,
both
in
this
statute
and
in
18
usc
1544
that
this
amending
legislation
has
been
proposed.
all
these,
i
think
all
the
bills
which
are
listed
in
mr.
travis
brief.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
no,
i’m
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
so
i
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
just
to
answer
the
first
portion
of
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice
fortas,
we
have
gone
the
congress
and
the
statute
which
mr.
mcturn
cited
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan
question
was
the
latest
proposal
at
the
department
of
state
recommended.
now
what
that
statute
does,
which
the
existing
laws
do
not,
is
that
it
simply
makes
it
a
crime
to
enter
an
area
where
to
which
travel
is
restricted.
but
we
think,
although
its
true
that
the
status
in
its
face
is
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be,
we
think
that
passports
have,
for
substantial
period
of
time,
been
advising
those
that
bear
it
and
those
to
whom
it’s
issued
that
they
are
not
valid
for
certain
destinations.
and,
the
passports
have
in
fact
been
referring
prior
to
that
cuba
regulations
of
1961
to
this
other
statute,
18
usc
1544.
because
when
dealing
with
countries
that
are
far
really
from
the
united
states
as
communist
china
and
some
of
the
others
to
which
travel
was
restricted,
i
think
it
could
very
reasonably,
been
supposed
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
prove
the
intent
which
is
required
under
section
1185.
now,
the
statutes
have
--
the
passport
statute
have
since
1941
borne
the
legend
on
the
last
page
that
“anyone
who
attempts
to
use
the
passport
in
violations
of
the
conditions
or
restrictions
contained
therein,
may
have
the
protection
of
the
united
states
withdrawn
from
him
while
they
continues
to
reside
abroad
and
they
be
liable
for
prosecution
under
the
provisions
of
section
221”
entitled
“22
united
states
code”
which
is
18
usc
1544”.
in
other
words,
the
department
of
state
was
never
suggesting,
as
petitioners
are
arguing,
that
this
was
merely
enforceable
by
a
civil
remedy.
in
other
words,
that
we
will
just
be
removing
protections.
it
was
entirely
clear
that
people
who
would
be
bearing
passports
and
if
they
violated
the
conditions
or
restrictions,
there
would
be
a
criminal
statute
that
would
apply.
prior
to
1961,
it
is
true
the
passport
did
not
explicitly
refer
to
this
criminal
statute
but
it
did
refer
to
18
usc
1544.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
we
think
that’s
true,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
precisely
the
problem
under
the
existing
statute.
a
man
who
is,
for
example,
travels
from
the
united
states
to
paris
and
does
not
then
intend
to
go
to
an
area
to
which
travel
is
restricted,
is
not,
if
he
then
decides
to
go
there,
violating
the
criminal
law
when
he
goes
to
the
area
to
which
travel
is
restricted.
the
problem
with
the
existing
two
statutes
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
there
were
various
loopholes
that
a
man
is
not
necessarily
violating,
and
either
of
them,
if
he
travels
to
an
area
to
which
traveler
is
restricted.
he
violates
this
statute,
the
one
involved
in
this
case,
only
if
he
has
the
intent
as
of
the
time
he
departs
from
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
it
does
say,
mister
chief
justice
that
it’s
not
–
he
doesn’t
necessarily
violate
any
criminal
statute.
and,
i
might
just
point
out
that
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
but
that
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
think
you
would
cheer
me
up
to
concede
that
the
statement
is
murky
and
it’s
ambiguous.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
committee
itself
felt
this
much
as
a
letter
which
appears
in
the
very
same
hearings
dated,
i
think
a
month
thereafter
from
the
committee
to
the
department
of
state,
specifically
refers
to
that
question
and
to
the
department
of
state’s
answer.
and
if
i
may
read
it,
that
letter
which
appears
on
page
78
of
the
very
same
hearing
says,
“on
page
32
of
the
transcript
you
were
asked
with
reference
to
the
press
release
of
1952
whether
at
that
time,
the
phrase
“not
valid
for
travel
to
country
x”
stamped
on
a
passport
which
is
interpreted
as
prohibition
for
travel
to
that
place
and
whether
the
department
has
authored
its
interpretation
of
that
phrase
between
1952
and
the
present
time.
the
material
submitted
on
this
question
was
not
responsive
to
the
question.
that’s
what
the
committee
believed.
and,
the
department
of
state
came
back
with
the
answer
which,
i
must
candidly
was
equally
ambiguous.
it
didn’t
say
that
it
was
a
criminal
probation.
it
didn’t
say
that
it
felt
it
was
not
but
it
was
–
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
fair
characterizes
that
whether
it
was
not
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
think
that
answer
would
not
have
put
him
unnoticed
but
i
think
the
passport
itself
did,
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
that’s
the
important
thing.
he
had
the
passport
–
the
passport
was
issued
to
him
–
and
that
passport
by
its
on
terms,
which
stated
that
18
usc
’44
would
apply
did
put
him
unnoticed.
i
think
travelers
don’t
ordinarily
read
senate
hearings
but
they
do
read
that
terms
of
their
own
passports.
now,
we
think,
in
terms
of
notice
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
pardon?
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
oh,
she
had
one
back
in
1958
and
honored
it
withstand
below.
that
passport
did
not
say
that
it
was
not
valid
for
travel
in
cuba
because
cuba
was
not
among
the
countries
listed
by
it
did
definitely
have
the
legend
that
this
passport
is
not
valid
for
and
then
we
had
an
enumeration
of
countries
and
then
it
stated
in
the
inside
back
cover
that
that
violations
of
conditions
or
restrictions
would
be
criminally
punishable,
use
rather
with
violations
of
conditions
or
restrictions
on
the
passport
would
be
criminally
liable.
i
think
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
a
person
to
whom
a
passport
has
been
issued,
who
uses
or
attempts
to
use
it
in
violation
of
the
conditions
or
restrictions
contained
therein
may
have
the
protection
of
the
united
stated
withdrawn
from
him
while
he
continues
to
reside
abroad
and
may
be
liable
for
prosecution
under
the
provisions
of
title
18
united
states
code
section
1544.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
her
passport
did
not
but
we
think,
when
the
secretary
announces
that
“all
passports
are
hereby
declared
invalid
for
travel
at
cuba”,
that
has
to
be
read
into
every
--
he
makes
a
public
announcement
of
it
that
we
think
that’s
in
effect
amending
people,
amending
the
passports
of
people
who
hold
existing
documents.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
think
that
question
would
be
presented,
mr.
chief
justice,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
it
was
here
stipulated
that
the
petitioner
definitely
didn’t
know
about
it.
i
think
we
would
certainly
and
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
no,
we
don’t
think
it
in
order
to
fly
the
people
who
did
not
actually
know
that
there
was
a
restriction
on
travel
to
that
area
who
would
accidentally
or
without
knowing
that
there’s
a
limitation
written
into
their
passport
with
travel
to
restricted
area.
i
don’t
think
any
such
prosecution
has
ever
been
broad
or
would
be
broad.
i
think
clearly
this
statute
would
apply
to
people
who
know.
and
this
statute,
because
of
its
intense
requirement,
i
think
would
be
so
limited.
it
would
apply
only
to
people
who
know
at
the
time
that
they
are
departing
the
united
states
that
their
passport
is
invalid
for
the
travel
on
which
they
are
going
to
engage.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
think
it’s
some
indication.
i
think
they
relied
though
quite
heavily
on
material
which
is
not
available
to
the
ordinary
citizen,
which
is
they
relied
quite
heavily
on
the
answer
to
the
question
that
you
just
read,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
they
were
saying
the
department
of
state
has
admitted
that
these
are
not
criminally
punishable.
and,
i
think
that
somebody,
really
an
ordinary
citizen
who
just
has
his
passport
and
just
reads
his
passport,
i
think
it’s
plainly
put
unnoticed
because
he
reads
it
he
looks
at
it
said
that
it’s
not
just
valid
to
the
trip
that
he
is
making.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
we
do
say
the
status
is
not
as
fine
--i
think
i
conceded
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
question
of
the
statute
is
certainly
not
as
plain
as
it
could
or
ideally
should
be.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
we
think
that
where
as
in
this
case,
the
legislative
intention
is
to
grant
abroad
powers
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
determining
what
is
a
valid
passport
and
where
the
statute
on
its
face
in
effect
tells
somebody
that
“you
may
not
leave
unless
you
have
a
valid
passport”.
we
think
ordinary
citizens
just
presented
with
that
command
that
they
may
not
leave
without
a
valid
passport
and
with
the
passport
saying
that
it’s
not
valid
for
travel
in
light
of
the
legislative
intention
behind
these
statutes
are
adequately
put
unnoticed.
i
think
that
there
have
been
a
substantial
series
of
cases,
decisions
by
this
court
which
have
said
that
although
it’s
generally
true
that
penal
statute
should
be
strictly
construed,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
they
are
construed
inconsistently
with
what
their
purpose
would
be.
now,
here
we
think,
congress
was
giving
or
was
intending
to
impose
restrictions
in
more
time
and
in
times
of
national
emergency
and
delegating
to
the
secretary
the
power
to,
within
traditional
limits,
set
those
restrictions.
now
we
think
it
would
be
–
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
this
court’s
decision
last
year
in
the
standard
oil
case,
for
example,
i
think
referred
to
the
fact
that
all
those
penal
statutes
should
have
been
strictly
construed.
that’s
not
done
in
order
to
--
when
the
legislative
intention
is
defeated.
i
think
even
this
court
decision,
recent
decision
in
a
case
such
as
united
states
vs.
price,
where
at
that
time
the
act
was
committed
in
the
price
case
after
all
there
was
substantial
doubt
among
legal
scholars
as
to
whether
the
act
committed
were
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
which
was
there
applicable.
and
yet,
this
court
construed
that
statute
despite
the
doubt
that
existed
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed
in
light
of
what
congress’
purpose
was
at
the
reconstruction
period
when
the
status
was
enacted.
now,
we
think
here,
in
light
of
the
specific
evils
that
congress
was
directing
its
intent,
attention
to
which
is
war
time
travel,
a
travel
in
times
of
national
emergency,
this
statute
should
be
read
to
put
travelers
unnoticed
that
their
departures
with
intention
to
violate
area
restrictions,
when
those
restrictions
are
written
plainly
into
the
passport,
violate
congress’
command.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
yesterday,
before
the
recess,
the
chief
justice
asked
me
whether
or
what
the
police
of
the
department
of
state
was
with
regard
to
newsman
traveling
to
areas
on
which
geographic
restrictions
had
been
imposed
by
the
department.
i’ve
been
advised
that
at
least
since
1957
it
has
been
the
unexceptional
rule
that
these
departments
apply
in
all
cases
that
bonafide
newsman
representing
the
established
news
media
will
be
given
authority
on
request
to
travel
on
these
areas.
prior
to
1957,
that
was
the
rule
as
to
all
areas
other
than
communist
china.
and
as
far
as
communist
china
is
concerned,
travel
was
almost
completely
restricted
to
that
particular
country.
returning
just
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
on
his
face,
our
contention,
our
view
that
section
1185’s
provision
that
a
traveler
departing
the
united
states
must
do
so
with
a
valid
passport
includes
in
that
rule.
the
fact
that
the
passport
must
be
valid
to
the
country
for
which
he
is
going
is
based
not
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
so
said
and
has
applied
that
rule
as
it
were
extraneously
to
a
passport.
we
think
that
the
destination
of
a
traveler
is
really
of
the
very
essence
of
what
a
passport
has
historically
has
been.
the
fact
is
that,
the
historical
function
of
the
passport
has
this
court
recognized
just
long
ago
was
ersytechqui
vs.
darse
in
9
peters
is,
as
the
document
addressed
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
the
government
of
far
nations,
advising
them
that
the
bearer
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
requesting
that
he
be
granted
courtesy
and
safe
travel
in
that
foreign
country.
if
a
passport
is
not
valid
and
it’s
so
marked
as
being
“not
valid”
to
a
particular
country,
it
is
in
effect
no
communication
to
that
country.
it’s
not
the
secretary
of
the
state
addressing
the
responsible
officials
there.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
think
the
first
area
restriction
was
really
imposed
way
back
in
1915
or
really
1914
with
regard
to
--
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
i
when
–
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
would
like
to
develop
may
be
more
so
on
the
succeeding
case
really
the
fact
that
there
was
a
criminal
penalty.
the
problem
so
far
is
the
administration
of
the
statute
is
involved,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
other
side
of
the
fact
that
they
were
in
effect
two
criminal
statutes
enacted
both
of
which
cover
various
forms
of
violation
of
area
restriction.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
yes,
but
it
is
a
substantial
re-enactment
of
the
statute
passed
first
on
1918
and
then
in
1941,
both
dealing
specifically
with
war
time
situation.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
no.
there
had
been
a
substantial
series
of
bills,
the
travis
brief,
the
petitioners
brief
in
this
case
cites
almost
30
which
were
introduced
between
the
85th
congress
and
this
past
congress.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
would
say
very
likely
the
reason
why
is
that,
the
congress
may
be
does
not
want
to
go
further
than
existing
legislation
in
that
area.
and
i
think
also
realistically
of
there
are
all
sorts
of
statutes
that
enter
into
why
a
bill
wasn’t
passed.
i
think
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
the
fact
that
congress
doesn’t
pass
the
bill
is
no
indication
of
a
legislative
intent.
but
i
do
think,
if
it
were
true
that
the
bills
proposed
did
no
more
than
the,
we
say
the
existing
law,
does
then
i
think
there
would
be
substance
to
petitioner’s
argument
that
the
proposal
of
those
bills
was
an
indication
that
the
departments
involved
believed
that
that
existing
legislation
didn’t
cover
this
problem.
but
the
fact
is,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
proposed
bills
do
substantially
more
than
existing
law
does.
under
existing
law
there
were
two
criminal
statutes
involved,
one
is
18
usc
1544
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
a
passport
in
violation
of
its
conditions.
and
that
was
enacted
in
1917;
the
second
criminal
statute
involve
is
the
statute
involved
here,
section
1185.
what
those
two
statutes
require
is
proof
under
1544
of
use
of
the
passport
which
is
generally
not
true
in
cases
of
travel
to
countries
which
we
have
no
diplomatic
relations
because
in
the
passports
it’s
not
just
used
in
order
to
enter
that
country.
and
what
this
statute
require,
the
present
statute,
1185,
is
proof
of
an
intent
to
go
to
that
country
at
the
time
of
departure.
now,
a
petitioner
contend
that
the
fact
that
they’ve
been
close
to
600
violations
of
area
restrictions
prior
to
the
bringing
of
these
prosecutions
indicates
that
the
department
of
state
did
not
believe
or
the
department
of
state
in
justice
did
not
believe
that
this
was
a
criminal
statute
that
was
applicable.
but
the
fact
is,
this
statute
applies
to
a
very
few
cases.
it
applies
only
to
cases
where
we
can
prove
intent
as
of
the
time
of
departure.
now,
that’s
very
difficult
when
you’re
dealing
with
travel,
let’s
say
to
communist
china.
we
can’t
prove
that
the
man,
who
travels
to
communist
china,
was
ordinarily
has
that
intent
at
the
time
he
departs
the
united
states
and
because
of
the
problems
of
proof,
both
in
this
statute
and
in
18
usc
1544
that
this
amending
legislation
has
been
proposed.
all
these,
i
think
all
the
bills
which
are
listed
in
mr.
travis
brief.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
no,
i’m
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
so
i
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
just
to
answer
the
first
portion
of
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice
fortas,
we
have
gone
the
congress
and
the
statute
which
mr.
mcturn
cited
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan
question
was
the
latest
proposal
at
the
department
of
state
recommended.
now
what
that
statute
does,
which
the
existing
laws
do
not,
is
that
it
simply
makes
it
a
crime
to
enter
an
area
where
to
which
travel
is
restricted.
but
we
think,
although
its
true
that
the
status
in
its
face
is
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be,
we
think
that
passports
have,
for
substantial
period
of
time,
been
advising
those
that
bear
it
and
those
to
whom
it’s
issued
that
they
are
not
valid
for
certain
destinations.
and,
the
passports
have
in
fact
been
referring
prior
to
that
cuba
regulations
of
1961
to
this
other
statute,
18
usc
1544.
because
when
dealing
with
countries
that
are
far
really
from
the
united
states
as
communist
china
and
some
of
the
others
to
which
travel
was
restricted,
i
think
it
could
very
reasonably,
been
supposed
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
prove
the
intent
which
is
required
under
section
1185.
now,
the
statutes
have
--
the
passport
statute
have
since
1941
borne
the
legend
on
the
last
page
that
“anyone
who
attempts
to
use
the
passport
in
violations
of
the
conditions
or
restrictions
contained
therein,
may
have
the
protection
of
the
united
states
withdrawn
from
him
while
they
continues
to
reside
abroad
and
they
be
liable
for
prosecution
under
the
provisions
of
section
221”
entitled
“22
united
states
code”
which
is
18
usc
1544”.
in
other
words,
the
department
of
state
was
never
suggesting,
as
petitioners
are
arguing,
that
this
was
merely
enforceable
by
a
civil
remedy.
in
other
words,
that
we
will
just
be
removing
protections.
it
was
entirely
clear
that
people
who
would
be
bearing
passports
and
if
they
violated
the
conditions
or
restrictions,
there
would
be
a
criminal
statute
that
would
apply.
prior
to
1961,
it
is
true
the
passport
did
not
explicitly
refer
to
this
criminal
statute
but
it
did
refer
to
18
usc
1544.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
we
think
that’s
true,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
precisely
the
problem
under
the
existing
statute.
a
man
who
is,
for
example,
travels
from
the
united
states
to
paris
and
does
not
then
intend
to
go
to
an
area
to
which
travel
is
restricted,
is
not,
if
he
then
decides
to
go
there,
violating
the
criminal
law
when
he
goes
to
the
area
to
which
travel
is
restricted.
the
problem
with
the
existing
two
statutes
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
there
were
various
loopholes
that
a
man
is
not
necessarily
violating,
and
either
of
them,
if
he
travels
to
an
area
to
which
traveler
is
restricted.
he
violates
this
statute,
the
one
involved
in
this
case,
only
if
he
has
the
intent
as
of
the
time
he
departs
from
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
it
does
say,
mister
chief
justice
that
it’s
not
–
he
doesn’t
necessarily
violate
any
criminal
statute.
and,
i
might
just
point
out
that
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
but
that
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
think
you
would
cheer
me
up
to
concede
that
the
statement
is
murky
and
it’s
ambiguous.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
committee
itself
felt
this
much
as
a
letter
which
appears
in
the
very
same
hearings
dated,
i
think
a
month
thereafter
from
the
committee
to
the
department
of
state,
specifically
refers
to
that
question
and
to
the
department
of
state’s
answer.
and
if
i
may
read
it,
that
letter
which
appears
on
page
78
of
the
very
same
hearing
says,
“on
page
32
of
the
transcript
you
were
asked
with
reference
to
the
press
release
of
1952
whether
at
that
time,
the
phrase
“not
valid
for
travel
to
country
x”
stamped
on
a
passport
which
is
interpreted
as
prohibition
for
travel
to
that
place
and
whether
the
department
has
authored
its
interpretation
of
that
phrase
between
1952
and
the
present
time.
the
material
submitted
on
this
question
was
not
responsive
to
the
question.
that’s
what
the
committee
believed.
and,
the
department
of
state
came
back
with
the
answer
which,
i
must
candidly
was
equally
ambiguous.
it
didn’t
say
that
it
was
a
criminal
probation.
it
didn’t
say
that
it
felt
it
was
not
but
it
was
–
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
fair
characterizes
that
whether
it
was
not
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
i
think
that
answer
would
not
have
put
him
unnoticed
but
i
think
the
passport
itself
did,
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
that’s
the
important
thing.
he
had
the
passport
–
the
passport
was
issued
to
him
–
and
that
passport
by
its
on
terms,
which
stated
that
18
usc
’44
would
apply
did
put
him
unnoticed.
i
think
travelers
don’t
ordinarily
read
senate
hearings
but
they
do
read
that
terms
of
their
own
passports.
now,
we
think,
in
terms
of
notice
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
pardon?
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
oh,
she
had
one
back
in
1958
and
honored
it
withstand
below.
that
passport
did
not
say
that
it
was
not
valid
for
travel
in
cuba
because
cuba
was
not
among
the
countries
listed
by
it
did
definitely
have
the
legend
that
this
passport
is
not
valid
for
and
then
we
had
an
enumeration
of
countries
and
then
it
stated
in
the
inside
back
cover
that
that
violations
of
conditions
or
restrictions
would
be
criminally
punishable,
use
rather
with
violations
of
conditions
or
restrictions
on
the
passport
would
be
criminally
liable.
i
think
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
a
person
to
whom
a
passport
has
been
issued,
who
uses
or
attempts
to
use
it
in
violation
of
the
conditions
or
restrictions
contained
therein
may
have
the
protection
of
the
united
stated
withdrawn
from
him
while
he
continues
to
reside
abroad
and
may
be
liable
for
prosecution
under
the
provisions
of
title
18
united
states
code
section
1544.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
her
passport
did
not
but
we
think,
when
the
secretary
announces
that
“all
passports
are
hereby
declared
invalid
for
travel
at
cuba”,
that
has
to
be
read
into
every
--
he
makes
a
public
announcement
of
it
that
we
think
that’s
in
effect
amending
people,
amending
the
passports
of
people
who
hold
existing
documents.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
think
that
question
would
be
presented,
mr.
chief
justice,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
it
was
here
stipulated
that
the
petitioner
definitely
didn’t
know
about
it.
i
think
we
would
certainly
and
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
justice
learned
hand
no,
we
don’t
think
it
in
order
to
fly
the
people
who
did
not
actually
know
that
there
was
a
restriction
on
travel
to
that
area
who
would
accidentally
or
without
knowing
that
there’s
a
limitation
written
into
their
passport
with
travel
to
restricted
area.
i
don’t
think
any
such
prosecution
has
ever
been
broad
or
would
be
broad.
i
think
clearly
this
statute
would
apply
to
people
who
know.
and
this
statute,
because
of
its
intense
requirement,
i
think
would
be
so
limited.
it
would
apply
only
to
people
who
know
at
the
time
that
they
are
departing
the
united
states
that
their
passport
is
invalid
for
the
travel
on
which
they
are
going
to
engage.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
i
think
it’s
some
indication.
i
think
they
relied
though
quite
heavily
on
material
which
is
not
available
to
the
ordinary
citizen,
which
is
they
relied
quite
heavily
on
the
answer
to
the
question
that
you
just
read,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
they
were
saying
the
department
of
state
has
admitted
that
these
are
not
criminally
punishable.
and,
i
think
that
somebody,
really
an
ordinary
citizen
who
just
has
his
passport
and
just
reads
his
passport,
i
think
it’s
plainly
put
unnoticed
because
he
reads
it
he
looks
at
it
said
that
it’s
not
just
valid
to
the
trip
that
he
is
making.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
we
do
say
the
status
is
not
as
fine
--i
think
i
conceded
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
question
of
the
statute
is
certainly
not
as
plain
as
it
could
or
ideally
should
be.
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
we
think
that
where
as
in
this
case,
the
legislative
intention
is
to
grant
abroad
powers
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
determining
what
is
a
valid
passport
and
where
the
statute
on
its
face
in
effect
tells
somebody
that
“you
may
not
leave
unless
you
have
a
valid
passport”.
we
think
ordinary
citizens
just
presented
with
that
command
that
they
may
not
leave
without
a
valid
passport
and
with
the
passport
saying
that
it’s
not
valid
for
travel
in
light
of
the
legislative
intention
behind
these
statutes
are
adequately
put
unnoticed.
i
think
that
there
have
been
a
substantial
series
of
cases,
decisions
by
this
court
which
have
said
that
although
it’s
generally
true
that
penal
statute
should
be
strictly
construed,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
they
are
construed
inconsistently
with
what
their
purpose
would
be.
now,
here
we
think,
congress
was
giving
or
was
intending
to
impose
restrictions
in
more
time
and
in
times
of
national
emergency
and
delegating
to
the
secretary
the
power
to,
within
traditional
limits,
set
those
restrictions.
now
we
think
it
would
be
–
mr.
justice
learned
hand
well,
this
court’s
decision
last
year
in
the
standard
oil
case,
for
example,
i
think
referred
to
the
fact
that
all
those
penal
statutes
should
have
been
strictly
construed.
that’s
not
done
in
order
to
--
when
the
legislative
intention
is
defeated.
i
think
even
this
court
decision,
recent
decision
in
a
case
such
as
united
states
vs.
price,
where
at
that
time
the
act
was
committed
in
the
price
case
after
all
there
was
substantial
doubt
among
legal
scholars
as
to
whether
the
act
committed
were
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
which
was
there
applicable.
and
yet,
this
court
construed
that
statute
despite
the
doubt
that
existed
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed
in
light
of
what
congress’
purpose
was
at
the
reconstruction
period
when
the
status
was
enacted.
now,
we
think
here,
in
light
of
the
specific
evils
that
congress
was
directing
its
intent,
attention
to
which
is
war
time
travel,
a
travel
in
times
of
national
emergency,
this
statute
should
be
read
to
put
travelers
unnoticed
that
their
departures
with
intention
to
violate
area
restrictions,
when
those
restrictions
are
written
plainly
into
the
passport,
violate
congress’
command.
