mr.
learned

you

mr.
cheif
justice
warren
mr.
learned,
what
do
you
say
to
the
inquiry
that
was
made
by
congress
of
the
department
of
state
concerning
the
effect
of
that
pass
of
that
press
release
that
we’ve
been
discussing
when
it
said
in
reply
that
“if
to
bear
in
this
country
x,
he
cannot
be
assured
of
the
protection
of
the
united
states”.
it
means
that
the
united
states
does
not
approve
for
the
bearers
going
to
country
x.
the
restriction
on
the
passport
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
if
a
bearer
travels
to
country
x,
he
will
be
violating
the
criminal
law.
what
do
you
say
as
to
that?
mr.
cheif
justice
warren
but
the
answer
of
this
answer
of
this
state
department
doesn’t
make
that
distinction
you
do.
mr.
cheif
justice

well,

them
when
i
got
those
that
--
when
he
enters
that
country,
he
cannot
be
assured
of
the
protection
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
united
states
would
rather
he
didn’t
go
there.
mr.
cheif
justice
warren
it
does
not
mean
that
he
would
be
violating
the
criminal
law
and
that
is
my
fair
reading
of
that
law
of
what
they
said.
mr.
cheif
justice
warren
was
the
answer
evasive?
mr.
cheif
justice
warren
from
the
stand
point
of
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
under
the
statue
and
you
must
himself
interpret
that,
would
you
say
that
it
was
obsessive
if
the
state
department
was
asked
a
question
and
answered
in
this
manner?
mr.
cheif

did
everybody

supposed
to

from
the
announcement
of
the

of

that
his
passport
is
not
good
anymore?
mr.
cheif
justice
warren
we
are
interpreting
a
statute
here
and
i
suppose
what
we
do
will
affect
a
lot
of
other
people
and
i
wonder
if
you
think
of
that
ago
that
far.
mr.
cheif
justice
warren
i
wonder
if
the
fact
that
the
bar
of
the
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
came
to
that
conclusion
that
the
statute
did
not
form
the
interpretation
as
you
put
on
it
would
not
have
some,
if
some
indication
that
it
was
at
least
doubtful
so
far
as
an
individual
is
concerned.
they
made
a
very
thorough
study
of

lawyers,
to
my
recollection

from

if
they
interpreted
it
that
way,
it
would
not
be
some
indication
that
an
average
citizen
would
find
it
difficult
to
understand
and
therefore,
it
would
be
vague
as
to
him?
mr.
cheif

as
i
read
your

i
thought
you
yourself
had
some
doubt
as
to
whether
did

mr.

how

you
reach
our
