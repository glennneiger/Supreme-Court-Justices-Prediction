unknown
speaker
mr.
chief
justice,
in
light
of
the
government’s
departures
on
the
record,
i
feel
impelled
to
make
a
complete
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question
yesterday
about
the
opacity
of
the
stipulation.
i
would
like
to
make
this
statement.
unknown
speaker
would
you
please
speak
a
little
louder?
unknown
speaker
would
you
state
the
question
that
you
are
answering?
unknown
speaker
surely.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
yesterday
why
the
stipulation
was
opaque
with
reference
to
what
the
petitioner
possess
at
the
time
she
departed
the
united
states.
i
told
him
that
i
couldn’t
go
beyond
the
record
at
that
point,
convince
him
the
government
has
gone
beyond
the
record.
i
would
like
to
make
this
statement.
at
the
time
that
stipulation
was
negotiated,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
members
of
the
court,
the
united
states
attorney
and
i
agreed
that
the
standard
of
criminality
to
be
applied
in
this
case
was
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
held
a
valid
passport
specifically
indorsed
for
travel
to
cuba.
having
agreed
upon
that
standard,
we
incorporated
the
language
which
you
referred
to
as
opaque
and
which
we
thought
at
the
time
was
quite
lucid.
it
was
on
that
theory
that
the
court
based
that
the
case
was
tried.
it
was
on
that
theory
that
the
case
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
and,
i
submit
that
it’s
a
theory
upon
which
this
case
was
preceded
from
the
very
beginning.
if
i
may
add
that
simply
one
more
thing
as
reference
to
that
legend
in
the
passport
concerning
section
1544,
that
section
has
never
been
invoked
in
the
case
of
alleged
violations
of
area
restrictions
and
it
was
not
referred
to
by
the
department
in
its
considered
reply
to
senator
full
bright
in
1957,
that
one
which
you
referred
earlier
mr.
chief
justice,
that
section
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
been
considered
as
having
any
application
to
geographic
restriction.
