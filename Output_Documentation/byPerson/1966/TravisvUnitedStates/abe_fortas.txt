justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcternan.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
i
know
you're
been
over
this
but
i
continue
to
be
worried
by
it.
is
it
your
view
that
we
must
approach
this
assuming
that
she
had
a
passport
or
assuming
that
she
did
not
have
a
passport
and
if
your
answer
to
that
is
neither
how
can
we
deal
with
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
because
1185
speaks
in
terms
of
a
valid
passport
as
being
necessary,
the
indictment,
the
stipulation
--
indictment
talks
in
terms
of
valid
passport
which
she
didn't
have
a
valid
passport
in
so
many
words.
the
stipulation
says,
she
did
not
have
a
valid
passport
endorsed
for
cuba.
now
there's
sort
of
a
link
in
ambiguity
to
put
it
mildly
throughout
all
of
these
that
causes
me
some
misgivings.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
a
problem
because
if
we
decide
that
the
government
just
failed
to
prove
something,
well,
there's
not
much
--
not
for
us
to
fool
around
with,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin,
if
you
assume
that
petitioner
had
a
passport
here,
if
the
petitioner
wanted
to
use
that
passport
to
go
to
france,
i
wouldn't
--
it
would've
been
a
valid
passport,
would
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
we
--
let's
assume
that
she
had
a
passport,
because
that
gets
us
into
the
compartment
of
unutterable
confusion,
(inaudible).
so
it
would've
been
a
valid
passport
for
that
purpose?
which
you're
saying
here
is
that
the
criminal
statute
has
to
be
around
to
say
that
the
1185
has
to
be
read.
say
that
when
she
has
a
passport
valid
for
the
country,
its
1185
(b),
i
think
it
is
unless
he
--
in
which
reads,
it
can't
depart
from
the
united
states
unless
he
bears
a
valid
passport.
you
have
to
read
it
unless
he
bears
a
passport
valid
for
the
country
to
which
he
intends
to
go,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
in
my
mind
it
--
then
help
you
very
much.
still
adding
some
words
to
the
statute,
what
it
says,
ordinarily
at
the
safety
you
have
a
valid
passport,
that
means
you
have
a
passport
that
is
validly
issued
that
has
not
expired.
now,
i
know
that
in
zemel,
this
court
construing
another
statute
namely
the
211
(a)
i
think
it
is
that
said
that
the
secretary
has
got
power
to
--
state
terms
and
conditions
or
to
add
to
common
understanding
a
valid
passport.
and
when
we're
here
dealing
with
the
criminal
statute,
there's
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
you're
not
--
whether
you're
just
relying
on
the
secretary's
power
to
define
a
valid
statute
or
whether
in
fact
what
you
are
doing
is
adding
some
rooms
to
the
criminal
statute
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
yues,
but
you
can't
quite
do
that
mr.
lewin,
can
you?
because
if
travis
had
a
passport,
she
would
have
had
an
nonofficial
passport
and
as
a
nonofficial
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
passport
contained
such
a
legend?
justice
abe
fortas
when
she
says
--
she
says
by
stipulation
as
i
understand
it
that
she
was
aware
of
that
and
inferentially
that
she
thought
that
when
she
got
down
to
cuba,
she
would
not
get
the
protection
of
the
united
states
government.
but
she
says
that
she
did
not
know
and
had
no
reason
to
know
that
the
statute
would
--
the
criminal
statute
would
apply
to
her
conduct,
isn't
that
about
it?
justice
abe
fortas
nobody's
challenging
that
as
i
understand
it.
there
were
--
our
problem
is
whether
they
should
have
gone
to
congress
if
they
wanted
to
apply
criminal
sanctions
here
whether
you
have
to
go
to
congress
and
get
the
congress
to
declare
the
crime
or
whether
in
effect
they
have
here
made
--
conduct
a
crime
and
circumstances
which
are
beyond
the
contentment
of
the
congress
or
beyond
the
congress
to
delegate
to
them
in
the
manner
in
which
congress
did
so?
justice
abe
fortas
except
you
said
they
never
referred
to
zone
restrictions?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
did
they
do
that
on
the
floor?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
makes
it
kind
of
rough,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
makes
it
kind
of
rough,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
suggesting
that
those
people
entered
under
the
circumstances
of
travis
allowed.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
learn
hand,
the
problem
here
is,
this
is
criminal
prosecution,
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
there
has
been
this
very
least
ambiguity
in
this
situation
for
good
long
time
and
when
did
the
department
start
using
area
restrictions?
justice
abe
fortas
there’s
no
criminal
penalty
then,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
we’re
dealing
now
on
statute
passed
in
1952,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
any
of
that,
whether
it’s
back
in
1915
or
1952,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
they
spend
some
--
i
should
think
reasonable
mind
would
have
to
use
certainly
one
of
them
when
–
can
seen
that
there’s
an
area
of
doubt
about
the
criminal
penalty
that
the
authorization
or
criminal
penalty
in
these
circumstances.
i
think
we
were
told
that
in
may
of
this
year,
a
bill
wasn’t
reduced
to
remedy
that
petitions,
that
ambiguity.
is
that
the
first
bill
that’s
been
introduced
on
the
subject?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
would
you
characterize
the
reason
why
none
of
those
has
been
passed?
justice
abe
fortas
you’re
not
telling
this,
are
you,
that
this
statute
is
not
entirely
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
it
is
entirely
clear
that
a
criminal
penalty
may
lawfully
be
imposed
in
these
circumstances?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
am
asking
about
is,
why
that
being
so
evident,
so
palpable
at
least
it
seems
to
me,
the
government
of
the
united
states,
states
department
of
--
department
of
justice
have
more
than
jointly
having
gone
the
congress
with
the
simple
bill
to
try
to
ascertain
what
congress
really
thinks
about
this.
i
mean,
what
they
really
want
to
do.
because
as
a
matter
and,
i’ll
stand,
you
are
asking
the
court
really
to
–
in
fact
this
is
not
a
statement
–
be
allowed.
the
government,
the
department
of
the
government
because
of
the
powerful
ambiguity
to
say
the
least
in
the
statute
and
when
we’re
dealing
in
the
area
of
criminal
jurisprudence.
justice

you
told
that
she
didn’t

you
told
that
she
didn’t’

justice
abe
fortas
you
said
this
--
tell
me
again
just
what
that
legend
was.
it
was
in
the
passport
that
this
petitioner
had.
justice
abe
fortas
but
her
passport
didn’t

any
condition
for
which
she
violated

far
as
this

shows.
