justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
how
long
are
these
laws
that
the
secretary
has
written
out
under
this
so-called
delegation
of
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long?
how
many
pages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
is
the
statutory
delegation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
delegations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
others,
how
many
occasions,
somewhat
like
the
tail
or
the
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
in
the
facts
--
to
the
facts
you've
--
who
is
the
president
under
those
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
who's
under
him?
it
was
really
the
secretary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
reg
--
on
regulation
to
this
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
at
least
travel
through
somebody
up
close
to
the
secretary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
delegation
is
to
the
president.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
delegation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
delegations
of
the
president,
by
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
who
has
delegated
it
on
down
to
the
undersecretary
--
on
the
undersecretary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
winds
up
as
a
crime
under
a
statute
which
the
congress
delegates
power
to
the
president,
the
president
delegates
it
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
then
the
secretary
of
states
delegates
it
someone
within
adherence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
terms
and
conditions
of
these
delegated
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
under
terms
and
conditions
of
issuance
of
passports,
as
described
by
these
--
whatever
you
call
them,
laws
or
regulations,
or
rules
that
the
handling
of
the
secretary
or
some
of
his
underlings
have
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
there's
some
limitation
on
delegation
now,
wasn't
it?
he
was
referenced
to
an
automobile?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
certain
terms
and
conditions
and
rules
and
regulations
and
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it
stands
for
what
is
done
--
what's
done
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
won't
bother
you
anymore
but
i
would
like
--
to
the
point
that
(inaudible).
what
is
this
congressional
standard
under
which
the
secretary
authorized
to
prohibit
travel
from
a
country?
what
is
the
congressional
standard
on
which
the
secretary
has
said?
what
does
he
have
to
prove
or
decide
is
the
truth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
large?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
large?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
well
--
well
might
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
new
ground
of
our
opinion,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
secretary
issued
the
standards
on
which
the
secretary
wished
to
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
congress
hasn't
done
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
left
him
at
large.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
wants
to
buy
from
a
state,
he
can
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
ordinarily,
i
would
have
thought
that
congress
was
supposed
to
pass
laws
and
its
--
not
just
to
turn
loose
to
one
man
to
pass
new
law.
but
to
say
you
can
do
this
within
this
limitation
and
does
not
get
on
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact
it
had
to
determine
whether
that
would
be
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
what
was
the
statute
we
were
to
prohibit.
we're
talking
about
prohibition
left
it
to
the
secretary
to
determine
if
that
should
be
a
law
prohibiting
people
from
traveling
to
certain
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
didn't
give
you
many
general
standards
in
choosing
between
countries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
you
wouldn't
deny
that
that's
a
rather
broad
standards
--
the
broad
standards
established
on
which
to
base
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
war
time
doesn't
suspend
the
constitution,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
conviction
and
the
punishment
if
that's
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
five
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
regulation
that's
limitable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
subject
to
the
secretary,
let
them
go,
if
they
wanted
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
to
let
every
reporter
go
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
being
said
that
even
--
because
he
had
issue
no
passport.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
means
he
has
considered
those,
given
special
consideration
and
let
him
go
if
he
wants
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
let
goes
--
go
that
he
wants
to
go?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
thought
he
knew
the
answer
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.

can
i
ask
you
how
long
are
these
laws
that
the
