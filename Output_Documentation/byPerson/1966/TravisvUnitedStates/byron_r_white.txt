justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
secretary
might
have
asked
the
chairman
--
well,
what
do
you
think
under
your
statute,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
this
would
--
just
been
an
opinion
of
a
--
the
secretary
of
state
is
what
a
statute
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
either
way,
you
argue
the
same.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
she
had
a
passport
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
read
that
as
saying
she
had
no
passport
at
all,
then
what,
would
your
argument
differ?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
1185
it
says
that
after
or
what
they
have
assessed
that
after
a
--
proclamation,
you're
not
suppose
to
leave
united
states
without
a
valid
--
without
a
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)i
take
it
that
--
are
there
some
country
--
would
you
agree
that
there
are
some
countries
to
which
you
might
depart
if
you
have
no
passport
at
all
and
thereby
subject
yourself
to
1185
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
no
passport
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
how
about
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
say
that
--
you
say
then
that
there
are
some
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary
which
purport
to
remove
any
criminal
penalty
at
all
no
matter
what
country
you're
going
to
and
whether
or
not
you
have
a
passport
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
eastern?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
eastern
hemisphere?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
if
you
left
united
states
without
any
passport
at
all
for
one
of
those
in
eastern
hemisphere
countries,
you
would
need
a
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
you
--
but
in
the
--
does
the
exemption
of
travel
to
western
hemisphere
countries
without
a
passport,
the
exemptions
under
1185
--
from
1185
criminal
penalty
rest
on
the
secretary's
regulations
that
you
did
not
need
a
passport
to
go
western
hemisphere?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
precedent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
you
say
--
and
then
the
secretary
came
along
and
said,
"all
hemisphere
countries
except
cuba."
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
why
is
that
cuba
then
in
the
same
--
oh,
i'll
ask
you
the
question
directly.
assume
someone
goes
to
cuba
without
any
passport
at
all,
how
about
a
criminal
penalty
under
1185?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
we
dealing
here
with
an
area
of
restriction
against
travel,
we
really
aren't?
we're
really
dealing
with
the
statutory
restriction
against
travel
without
a
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
it
may
be
that
the
secretary
has
power
himself
to
impose
area
restrictions
wholly
aside,
wholly
aside
from
the
statutes.
hasn't
the
court
held
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
wholly
aside
from
this
statute,
1185.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
haven't
dealt
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
here
is
a
statutory
restriction
against
travel
without
his
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
government
is
arguing
that
that's
--
that
that
statutory
restriction
against
travel
without
any
passport
applies
to
cuba?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
have
no
passport
for
a
travel
to
cuba
if
you
don't
have
a
valid
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

argument,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
i
--
i
didn't
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
think
i
said
anything
different?
justice
byron

white
how
long
the
criminal
sanctions
been
available?
justice
byron

white
this
not
only
had
made
an
exception
to
an
exception
but
it
added
something
to
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government's
brief
says
something
about
we
are
advised
that
she
had
a
revoked
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
--
a
revoke?
i
thought
the
state
is
the
one
with
the
revoke
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
no
pass,
it's
a
no
pass
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
is
that
cfr
you
--
i
got
little
behind
you
on
this
--
justice
byron

white
and
where
is
the
excluding

amendment?
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
i
got
you,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
is
the
area
restriction
that
covers
cuba?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
--
that
isn't
the
--
oh,
that
means
is
--
all
that
means
is
if
you
need
a
passport
to
go
to
cuba?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
d
--
d
did
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
the
kind
of
a
--
what
other
countries
in
the
world
are
in
the
same
position
as
cuba,
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
any
other
existing
area
of
restrictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
--
those
--
aren't
those
sort
of
in
the
same
category
that
some
people
get
to
go?
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
to
--
don't
they
have
to
have
what's
called
a
special
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
--
doesn't
make
cuba
unique
for
me
to
--
the
paragraph
2
of
appendix
d
doesn't
make
cuba
unique?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
--
well,
you
mean
that
you
aren't
really
--
you
aren't
really
questioning
the
area
of
restriction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
--
if
the
secretary
just
decide
it
under
his
powers
to
issue
specific
passports
for
every
country
in
the
world
and
then
one
go
to
a
certain
country
and
have
to
get
a
passport
say
on
the
outside,
i
mean,
passport
for
travel
to
x,
you'd
have
a
whole
series
then.
i
suppose
if
you
got
one
for
x
and
then
went
to
y
to
limit
--
which
was
within
the
area
of
restriction
you
would
be
going
with
a
no
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
leaving.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
no
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
the
bottom
of
the
outside
of
the
passport
says,
this
is
no
passport
if
you're
going
to
--
b,
to
the
mexico.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lewin,
zemel
didn't
deal
with
1185?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
it
that
the
--
or
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
do
you
rely
at
all
on
1185
for
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
issue
the
except
cuba
regulation
which
appears
at
page
56
of
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
rely
--
don't
you
rely
wholly
on
the
1926
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
executive
order
of
1938?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i
--
i'm
just
asking
whether
you
rely
on
it
for
his
issuing
these
were
--
these
words
that
he
issued
in
this
regulation.
hereafter,
united
states
passport
shall
not
be
valid
for
travel
to
cuba
unless
specifically
endorsed
to
such
travel.do
you
rely
on
that
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
you
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
only
because
the
secretary
only
purported
to
rely
on
the
26th
act
and
the
38th
executive
order
that
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
the
only
possible
source?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
did
much
more
than
that.
i
mean,
the
secretary
did
much
more
than
that.
he
said,
not
only
can't
you
go
to
--
do
you
need
a
passport
to
go
to
cuba
but
you
can't
go
at
all
to
cuba
even
with
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
respect,
you
rely
wholly
on
the
1926
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
impose
that
area
of
restriction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
you'd
be
in
much
a
stronger
position
it
seems
to
me
if
you
argued
which
you
haven't
--
it
seems
like
you
don't
intend
to
argue
that
the
--
that
1185
itself
that
congress
in
saying
you
know
that
when
it's
a
proclamation
issued,
you
need
a
passport
to
travel
some
--
to
travel.
that
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
put
travel
within
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
some
extent
in
the
time
of
war
and
that
one
of
the
things
he
could
do
in
the
process
of
issuing
or
not
issuing
passports
was
to
decide
that
there
were
some
countries
to
which
nobody
should
travel.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you
really
had
--
you'd
--
do
you
really
argue
that?
the
secretary
didn't
think
he
was
exercising
under
such
authority,
is
that
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
say
so.
it
says
in
issuing
this
part
of
the
regulation,
he
--
could
then
be
relying
on
the
--
on
section
211
(a)
and
on
executive
order
1938.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
wasn't
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
small
print
in
your
brief,
i
don't
see
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
that
55
or
should
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
too
small
for
me
too
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
lewin,
do
you
really
think
you're
depriving
united
states
with
something
which
you
would
be
deprived
to
something
pretty
serious
of
1185,
that's
not
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
--
what
if
you
ask
people
to
--
if
the
person
didn't
have
a
passport
1185
applies
right
off
the
states,
doesn't
have
any
passport
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
a
--
is
some
one
is
going
to
cuba,
i
suppose
the
secretary
would
need
these
to
a
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
ask
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
yeah,
but
--
what
if
the
requirement
is
he
has
to
fill
it
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
have
this
specific
question,
are
you
going
to
--
and
you
cover
those
places
where
you
have
area
restrictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then,
what
if
somebody
said
that,
"no,
i'm
not
going."
and
then
they
went
ahead
went?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
big
--
what's
the
big
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
problem
with
all
outstanding
passports
at
the
end
and
even
--
and
more
--
the
most
that
those
have
--
don't
have
that
legend
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
so
much
with
those
that
have
that
legend
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
most
--
that
if
--
where
there's
only
one
trip?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
that's
what
you're
really
talking
about
one
trip.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
her
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that
regulation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
secretary
might
have
asked
the
chairman
--
well,
what
do
you
think
under
your
statute,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
this
would
--
just
been
an
opinion
of
a
--
the
secretary
of
state
is
what
a
statute
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
either
way,
you
argue
the
same.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
she
had
a
passport
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
read
that
as
saying
she
had
no
passport
at
all,
then
what,
would
your
argument
differ?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
1185
it
says
that
after
or
what
they
have
assessed
that
after
a
--
proclamation,
you're
not
suppose
to
leave
united
states
without
a
valid
--
without
a
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

take
it
that
--
are
there
some
country
--
would
you
agree
that
there
are
some
countries
to
which
you
might
depart
if
you
have
no
passport
at
all
and
thereby
subject
yourself
to
1185
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
no
passport
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
how
about
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
say
that
--
you
say
then
that
there
are
some
regulations
issued

white
how
about
the
eastern?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
eastern
hemisphere?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
if
you
left
united
states
without
any
passport
at
all
for
one
of
those
in
eastern

countries,
you
would
need

justice

and
then
the

came
along
and
said,

justice

and
so
why
is
that

then
in
the

oh,
i'll
ask
you
the
question
directly.
assume
someone
goes
to

how
about

--
a

i
thought

the
one
with
the
revoke
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
no
pass,
it's
a
no
pass
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
is
that
cfr
you
--
i
got
little
behind
you
on
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
is
the
excluding
cuba
amendment?
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
i
got
you,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
is
the
area
restriction
that
covers
cuba?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
--
that
isn't
the
--
oh,
that
means
is
--
all
that
means
is
if
you
need
a
passport
to
go
to
cuba?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
d
--
d
did
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
the
kind
of
a
--
what
other
countries
in
the
world
are
in
the
same
position
as
cuba,
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
any
other
existing
area
of
restrictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
--
those
--
aren't
those
sort
of
in
the
same
category
that
some
people
get
to
go?
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
to
--
don't
they
have
to
have
what's
called
a
special
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
--
doesn't
make
cuba
unique
for
me
to
--
the
paragraph
2
of
appendix
d
doesn't
make
cuba
unique?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
--
well,
you
mean
that
you
aren't
really
--
you
aren't
really
questioning
the
area
of
restriction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
--
if
the
secretary
just
decide
it
under
his
powers
to
issue
specific
passports
for
every
country
in
the
world
and
then
one
go
to
a
certain
country
and
have
to
get
a
passport
say
on
the
outside,
i
mean,
passport
for
travel
to
x,
you'd
have
a
whole
series
then.
i
suppose
if
you
got
one
for
x
and
then
went
to
y
to
limit
--
which
was
within
the
area
of
restriction
you
would
be
going
with
a
no
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
leaving.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
no
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
the
bottom
of
the
outside
of
the
passport
says,
this
is
no
passport
if
you're
going
to
--
b,
to
the
mexico.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lewin,
zemel
didn't
deal
with
1185?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
it
that
the
--
or
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
do
you
rely
at
all
on
1185
for
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
issue
the
except
cuba
regulation
which
appears
at
page
56
of
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
rely
--
don't
you
rely
wholly
on
the
1926
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
executive
order
of
1938?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i
--
i'm
just
asking
whether
you
rely
on
it
for
his
issuing
these
were
--
these
words
that
he
issued
in
this
regulation.
hereafter,
united
states
passport
shall
not
be
valid
for
travel
to
cuba
unless
specifically
endorsed
to
such
travel.do
you
rely
on
that
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
you
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
only
because
the
secretary
only
purported
to
rely
on
the
26th
act
and
the
38th
executive
order
that
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
the
only
possible
source?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
did
much
more
than
that.
i
mean,
the
secretary
did
much
more
than
that.
he
said,
not
only
can't
you
go
to
--
do
you
need
a
passport
to
go
to
cuba
but
you
can't
go
at
all
to
cuba
even
with
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
respect,
you
rely
wholly
on
the
1926
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
impose
that
area
of
restriction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
you'd
be
in
much
a
stronger
position
it
seems
to
me
if
you
argued
which
you
haven't
--
it
seems
like
you
don't
intend
to
argue
that
the
--
that
1185
itself
that
congress
in
saying
you
know
that
when
it's
a
proclamation
issued,
you
need
a
passport
to
travel
some
--
to
travel.
that
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
put
travel
within
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
some
extent
in
the
time
of
war
and
that
one
of
the
things
he
could
do
in
the
process
of
issuing
or
not
issuing
passports
was
to
decide
that
there
were
some
countries
to
which
nobody
should
travel.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you
really
had
--
you'd
--
do
you
really
argue
that?
the
secretary
didn't
think
he
was
exercising
under
such
authority,
is
that
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
say
so.
it
says
in
issuing
this
part
of
the
regulation,
he
--
could
then
be
relying
on
the
--
on
section
211
(a)
and
on
executive
order
1938.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
wasn't
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
small
print
in
your
brief,
i
don't
see
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
that
55
or
should
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
too
small
for
me
too
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
lewin,
do
you
really
think
you're
depriving
united
states
with
something
which
you
would
be
deprived
to
something
pretty
serious
of
1185,
that's
not
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
--
what
if
you
ask
people
to
--
if
the
person
didn't
have
a
passport
1185
applies
right
off
the
states,
doesn't
have
any
passport
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
a
--
is
some
one
is
going
to
cuba,
i
suppose
the
secretary
would
need
these
to
a
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
ask
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
yeah,
but
--
what
if
the
requirement
is
he
has
to
fill
it
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
have
this
specific
question,
are
you
going
to
--
and
you
cover
those
places
where
you
have
area
restrictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then,
what
if
somebody
said
that,
"no,
i'm
not
going."
and
then
they
went
ahead
went?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
big
--
what's
the
big
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
problem
with
all
outstanding
passports
at
the
end
and
even
--
and
more
--
the
most
that
those
have
--
don't
have
that
legend
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
so
much
with
those
that
have
that
legend
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
most
--
that
if
--
where
there's
only
one
trip?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
that's
what
you're
really
talking
about
one
trip.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
her
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that
regulation
--
