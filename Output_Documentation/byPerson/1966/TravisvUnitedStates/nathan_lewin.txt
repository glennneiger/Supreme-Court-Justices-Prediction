mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
one
immediately
following
it,
concern
the
meaning
and
constitutionality
of
section
215
(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
which
mr.
mcternan
has
been
referring
to
as
section
1185
because
it's
that
so
numbered
in
title
8.
that
provision
was
first
enacted
in
world
war
i
in
1918,
reenacted
with
a
slight
modification
just
prior
to
our
entering
into
world
war
ii
and
took
its
present
form
at
the
time
of
the
korean
war.
section
215
(b)
in
pertinent
part
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
and
i
quote,
"when
the
united
states
is
at
war
or
during
the
existence
of
any
national
emergency
proclaimed
by
the
president
after
the
president
has
also
proclaimed
that
additional
restrictions
on
departure
or
entry
are
needed
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states."
and
here
again
i
quote,
"to
depart
from
the
united
states
unless
he
bears
a
valid
passport."
the
statute
provides
that
this
prohibition
is
to
apply,
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
president
and
subject
to
such
limitations
and
exceptions
as
the
president
may
authorize
and
prescribed."
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner's
departure
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
secretary
of
state
mr.
justice
black
has
been
delegating
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
regulations
of
this
kind
generally
go
through
the
secretary
of
state.
they
may
begin
at
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
and
the
passport
office
of
the
bureau.
but
they
go
up
through
the
secretary.
i
don't
think
that
these
restrictions
are
ever
imposed
or
a
country
is
ever
added
to
the
list
of
those
to
which
travelers
restricted
without
the
approval
of
the
secretary
or
the
very
least
of
the
undersecretary,
i
think
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
delegation
--
yes.
well,
the
secretary
is
authorized
by
--
i
forgot
exactly
the
section
but
there's
a
section
in
title
5
which
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state
to
exercise
foreign
policy
functions
which
are
delegated
by
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
a
certain
sentence
from
the
president
to
the
secretary
sir,
i
mean
a
certain
sense,
congress
has
made
that
delegation
by
passing
the
statute
which
appears
in
title
5.
within
the
department
of
state,
those
delegations
are
of
course
made
by
department
regulations.
i
imagine
the
secretary
of
state
or
i'm
not
sure
exactly
who
the
official
is
in
the
state
department
who
structures
the
delegation's
authorizations
within
that
department.
but
certainly,
any
authorizations
from
the
secretary
to
the
undersecretary
is
made
by
--
i
would
imagine
a
formal
state
department
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
as
i
hoped
to
point
out
in
my
argument
what
this
--
all
that
the
congress
has
made
a
crime
is
departing
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
under
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
secretary's
issuance
of
passports.
in
other
words,
the
secretary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
black
but
we
think
that
that
in
every
respect
is
very
much
like
the
delegation
that
exists
for
example
when
a
statute
says
that
it's
an
offense
to
drive
an
automobile
without
a
valid
operator's
license.
now,
they
maybe
people
within
the
commission
of
motor
vehicles
who
will
be
drawing
up
regulations
and
determining
how
long
or
what
a
--
a
driving
license
is
effective?
what
its
terms
are?
whether
the
holder
of
it
must
be
wearing
eyeglasses?
how
he
can
drive?
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely.
but
we
think
that
congress'
enactment
of
the
statute
does
nothing
more
mr.
justice
black
than
simply
say
that
when
you
leave
the
united
states,
you
must
have
in
your
hand
an
authorization
under
the
authority
that's
been
delegated
to
the
secretary
which
permits
him
to
issue
passports.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
and
the
kind
of
regulations
that
are
involved
here,
i
might
just
add
mr.
justice
black,
of
course
those
that
this
court
explicitly
sustain
against
an
attack
based
on
delegation
in
the
zemel
case.
so
that
in
terms
of
delegation,
we
think
that
that
the
zemel
case
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
case
on
the
delegation
issue
does
control
this
one.
in
other
words,
what
it
does
say
is
that
the
secretary
maybe
delegated
the
power
to
make
this
kind
of
a
condition
or
this
kind
of
a
restriction
upon
the
validity
of
the
passport
and
that's
all
the
secretary
does.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
rely
entirely
on
that
in
terms
of
the
power
which
the
secretary
has
to
impose
conditions
or
in
effect
set
out
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
rely
on
that
act
insofar,
yes.
insofar
as
that
act
authorizes
and
i
hope
to
elaborate
this
really
similar
--
more
in
my
argument
because
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
state
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
if
i
may,
what
the
powers
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
that
were
exercised
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no
we
rely
--
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
rely
--
in
terms
of
the
secretary
setting
of
conditions,
we
rely
on
the
26th
act.
on
the
other
hand,
in
terms
of
the
secretary's
providing
as
you
put
it
in
exception
to
an
exception
of
course,
we
rely
entirely
on
section
1185.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
and
in
that
sense,
we
think
that
the
--
that
what
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
rely
in
the
19
--
yes.
we
rely
in
the
1926
act
so
far
as
this
authority
is
concerned.
we
rely
on
section
1185
so
far
as
whether
it's
a
criminal
offense.
in
other
words,
we're
saying
what
section
1185
did
was
it
said
that
the
authority
that
the
secretary
exercises
under
the
1926
act
is
to
impose
conditions
or
in
anyway
to
restrict
a
validity
of
a
passport.
congress
in
the
19
--
in
section
1185
said,
"if
anybody
departs
the
united
states
with
a
passport
that
the
secretary
declares
under
his
authority,
under
the
1926
act
has
being
invalid,
that
person
just
committed
a
crime."
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
maybe
i've
misunderstood
your
question.
i
definitely
--
to
that
extent,
we
certainly
rely
on
the
--
on
section
215
(b)
or
section
1185.
in
other
words,
what
we're
saying
is,
congress
having
recognized
that
it
delegated
power
to
the
secretary
then
provided,
at
times
of
war,
both
in
world
war
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
the
secretary
did
think
he
was
exercising
authority
under
section
1185
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
as
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
the
--
i
think
that
--.
as
that
appears
in
the
federal
register
mr.
justice
white,
and
we
try
to
point
that
out
in
our
brief.
it
does
have
the
reference
to
section
1185
(and
under
the
rules
of
construction
that
the
federal
register
of
the
code
of
federal
regulation
provides
that
is
whatever
appears
in
small
print)
is
part
of
the
authority
relied
upon.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no
at
55
what
--
that
gives
the
form
of
the
public
notice
as
it
was
issued
on
january
16,
1961.
(voice
overlap)but
the
--
at
page
38
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
the
reference
in
the
federal
register
which
does
have
section
215,
8
u.s.c.
1185
following
the
text
of
the
amended
regulations.
and
also
refer
there
to
the
provision
in
1
cfr
xxvi
which
provides
that
each
section
of
the
code
is
followed
by
the
citation
of
the
statutory
authority
under
the
section
decision.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
whether
travis
would
think
that
it
was
--
and
again
i
hope
to
develop
this
in
the
argument
that
whether
travis
would
think
that
this
public
notice
specifically
rely
on
section
1185
is
really
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
she
had
notice
of
the
restriction
and
of
the
fact
that
she
could
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
--
there
is
no
men
--
there's
no
enumeration
in
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
of
any
standards
whatever?
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
at
large.
i
must
say
--
i
think
the
department
of
state
itself
was
concern
over
this
at
large
delegation
and
has
since
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
true
but
--
since
these
cases
mr.
justice
black
and
the
department
of
state
has
issued
regulations
specifically
enumerating
the
standards
on
--
which
the
secretary
exercise
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
congress
did
not
do
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
secretary
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
of
course
the
secretary
is
bound
under
this
court's
decisions
by
his
own
regulations
and
he
can't
depart
from
that.
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true
but
the
only
limitation
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
passport
--
and
this
i
think
was
congress'
purpose.
congress
was
saying
that
you
need
in
times
of
war
a
passport
which
the
secretary
declares
to
be
valid.
and
left
to
the
secretary
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
left
to
the
secretary
to
determine
what
the
standards
of
validity
would
be.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
by
necessity
really
what
congress
left
to
the
secretary
was
the
choice
of
the
countries.
we
--
i
think
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
zemel
opinion
that
this
practice
have
been
one
of
long
standards
of
the
secretary
of
the
state.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
gave
no
general
standards
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
the
only
reason
for
that
was
that
it
felt
that
he
couldn't
really
anticipate
what
the
problems
are
that
might
arise
which
might
cause
or
require
area
restrictions
in
various
instances.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
a
broad
standard
mr.
justice
black.
our
defense
of
it
is
only
that
it's
--
it
was
the
congress
may
have
felt
that
it
was
necessary
in
time
of
war
and
these
were
war
time
statutes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it's
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
she
had
a
passport,
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
read
it
a
little
bit
more
generically
or
broader
than
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
say
unless
he
bears
the
passport
which
is
valid
for
his
travel
which
includes
the
country
to
which
he
goes,
the
purpose
of
this
travel.
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
think
that
all
that
we're
saying
is
that
when
you
have
--
when
he
travel,
has
in
his
hand
the
passport
and
the
passport
has
on
it,
in
its
present
form
a
page
specifically
on
which
the
department
of
state
can
endorse
extensions,
amendments,
limitations
and
restrictions
and
it
has
traditionally
in
a
passport
endorsed
restrictions
in
terms
of
the
validity
of
a
passport.
in
other
words,
if
it
said
that
this
passport
is
not
valid
unless
signed.
or
as
another
illustration,
one
of
the
department
of
states
passport
forms
is
an
official
passport
which
can
be
used
by
government
officials
going
abroad.
now
that
passport
specifically
provide
--
this
passport
is
valid
for
travel
abroad
only
while
the
bearer
thereof
maintains
the
official
status
which
the
passport
was
issued
or
endorsed.
our
argument
is
that
the
secretary
of
state
had
issued
a
document
which
--
in
which
he
has
said
that
this
document
is
in
effect
no
passport
if
you
violate
that
term.
if
an
official
who
had
a
passport,
an
official
passport,
one
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
unofficial
--
the
regular
passports
contains
a
legend
which
says,
"this
passport
is
not
valid
for
travel
to
or
in
communist
controlled
portions
of
china,
korea,
vietnam
or
to
or
in
albania
or
cuba."
in
other
words,
the
secretary
of
state
has
said
by
the
very
document
which
she
is
authorized
to
issue
under
the
statute
that
this
is
not
the
official
document
it
may
look
like
if
you
use
it
for
certain
kinds
of
travel.
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mrs.
travis,
if
she
left
with
this
document
on
a
trip,
on
a
voyage
to
cuba,
was
leaving
with
the
document
which
by
its
own
terms
revoked
it
or
(inaudible)
it
(voice
overlap)
such
a
print.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
her
argument,
yes.
but
we
say
that
she
should
--
knew
or
should
have
known
that
any
conditions
of
validity
which
the
secretary
of
state
imposes
in
the
document
which
authorized
her
to
leave
are
by
the
terms
of
this
statute
of
1185
must
be
met
at
the
time
of
her
departure.
and
if
the
secretary
of
state
had
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
during
mr.
mcternan's
argument,
issued
separate
passports
for
every
destination
in
the
world.
and
had
said,
well,
if
you
want
to
go
to
cuba,
if
you
want
to
go
to
france,
you
must
get
a
passport
a
or
passport
b
and
somebody
attempted
to
leave
the
united
states
on
a
trip
to
france
with
a
passport
which
was
only
good
to
cuba
then
we
say
that
person
would
have
been
violating
1185
and
we
finally
have
known
it
because
he
would
have
known
by
the
terms
of
his
own
passport
that
it
was
not
valid
for
the
trip
which
he
was
taking.
in
addition,
the
--
we
think
that
what
really
makes
that
quite
clear
for
section
1185
is
the
fact
that
section
1185
by
its
history
is
a
war
time
or
emergency
statute.
it
was
enacted
in
world
war
i.
it
was
reenacted
in
world
war
ii
and
then
at
the
time
the
korean
war.
both
during
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
the
laub
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
no
---
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
can't
say
that
mrs.
travis
had
her
passports.
but
the
laub
defendants
in
there
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
understand.
no.
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mrs.
travis
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
1962,
the
passport
would
have
said
this,
precisely
would
have
had
that
legend
on
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
facts
are
if
i
can
maybe
just
clarify,
if
i
say
things
may
be
we
--
they're
not
specifically
in
the
record.
but
the
facts
are
that
mrs.
travis
had
a
revoked
passport.
she
had
a
passport
with
this
issued
back
in
1958.
it
did
not
--
at
1958
that
legend
was
not
on
the
passport.
that
passport
had
been
revoked
by
the
department
of
state.
she
had
received
a
letter
from
the
state
department
advising
her
that
her
passport
had
been
revoked
and
was
no
longer
valid.
that
was
the
only
document
of
that
kind
that
she
had
in
her
possession
at
the
time
that
she
made
these
trips.
mr.
nathan
lewin
she
does
not
now
have
a
passport
so
far
as
i
know.
she
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
she
traveled
in
violation
of
the
state
department's
area
restriction
to
communist
china
and
the
--
for
that
reason,
her
passport
then
was
used
a
broad
mark
valid
only
for
return
to
the
united
states
and
after
her
return
to
the
united
states
her
passport
was
officially
revoked
by
notice
sent
to
her
from
the
state
department.
mr.
nathan
lewin
five
years.
mr.
nathan
lewin
five
years
and
a
$5,000
fine.
the
statute
as
i
said
is
a
war
time
measure
and
what
in
our
view
makes
that
--
what
in
our
view
makes
that
particularly
important
is
the
fact
that
both
during
world
war
i
and
during
world
war
ii,
it
was
the
policy
of
the
department
of
state
to
issue
passports
precisely
of
a
kind
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to.
they
were
passports
which
on
the
page
dedicated
to
renewals,
extensions,
amendments,
limitations,
and
restrictions.
the
department
of
state
endorsed
a
restriction
which
made
that
passport
valid
only
for
a
particular
destination
and
for
a
specific
purpose.
in
other
words,
these
were
war
time
restrictions
on
travel
abroad.
a
time
that
there
were
hostilities
in
europe,
a
passport
for
example
issued
in
the
1944
or
1945,
specifically
stated
on
that
page
that
the
passport
was
"not
valid
for
travel
in
any
country
except"and
then
listed
the
passport
to
which
it
was
valid
and
the
purposes
of
which
it
was
valid.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
justice
fortas
that
they
did
go
to
congress.
that
it
was
precisely
in
order
to
give
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
president
as
the
statute
puts
it,
broad
powers
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
might
arise
in
war
time
that
the
statute
was
passed.
and
it
was
passed
through
the
congress
that
had
knowledge
of
this
kind
of
restrictions.
and
that's
why
we
think
that
the
restrictions
are
relevant
because
when
congress
said,
a
pass
--
you
must
--
you
may
not
depart
the
united
states
without
a
valid
a
passport.
we
submit
it
had
knowledge
of
this
practice
of
the
department
of
state
and
that
it
was
in
effect
incorporating
those
kinds
of
standards
of
validity
into
the
statute
which
it
passed.
now,
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
debates
and
the
reports
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
original
of
--
statute
which
is
a
predecessor
to
section
1185
in
1918
at
the
time
of
world
war
i.
well,
there
is
no
question
--
this
is
the
only
--
this
is
the
extent
of
our
concession
but
mr.
mcternan
has
attributed
to
us
a
concession
that
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
cover
this
or
that
the
legislative
history
does.
we
don't
concede
that
for
any
means.
we
think
the
statute
on
its
face
does
make
this
a
crime.
now,
the
legislative
history
supports
the
proposition
that
congress
was
delegating
to
the
president,
to
the
secretary
of
state
the
powers
which
it
felt
that
president
and
secretary
of
state
had
to
exercise
in
this
kind
of
circumstances.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
do
concede
that
the
discussions
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
the
house
and
the
house
reports
did
not
specifically
refer
the
area
restrictions
of
such.
in
other
words,
they
at
no
point
in
the
house
--
there's
really
only
one
house
report.
that's
all
what
there
is
on
this
bill
and
its
three
pages
long
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
the
senate
report
just
has
a
few
technical
amendments
which
were
reported
out
of
the
senate
committee.
they
are
in
i
was
told
about
25
to
30
pages
of
floor
debate.
the
main
focus
of
congress'
concern
at
the
time
was
that
the
executive
had
to
have
some
way
of
controlling
who
is
coming
in
and
who
is
going
out
of
the
united
states.
but
it's
also
clear,
we
submit
from
both
the
discussion
on
the
floor
and
from
the
house
reports
that
it
was
congress'
intention
to
make
a
broad
delegation
as
broad
as
it
constitutionally
could
to
these
president
and
the
secretary
to
deal
with
war
time
exit
and
entry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
never
referred
to
area
restriction.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
on
the
floor,
almost
all
the
discussions
was
devoted
to
whether
the
statute
would
cover
a
--
would
cover
a
movement
from
the
united
states
to
canada
and
back
from
canada
to
united
states.
and
most
representatives
and
senators
from
the
northern
states
were
concern
that
their
constituents
might
in
some
way
be
subjected
to
criminal
sanctions
because
they
were
going
to
canada
without
a
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
--
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
assurance
is
that
were
given
at
the
time
though,
we
submit,
were
indicated
that
the
president
would
have
the
authority
by
the
exception
provisions
of
section
1185
to
accept
canada
from
the
reach
of
the
statute.
well,
to
that
extent
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
submit
that
this
was
an
indication
that
this
is
not
merely
a
border
control
statute
because
specifically
what
the
congress
was
focusing
on
was
whether
people
would
be
able
to
go
to
canada
and
whether
the
president
would
be
able
to
make
exceptions
for
travel
to
canada.
now
if
as
petitioner
contends
and
as
the
defendants
in
laub
contend,
this
--
the
statute
were
merely
a
border
control
measure
and
the
only
thing
that
the
congress
was
interested
in
was
in
having
some
way
in
which
the
secretary
of
state
could
pass
on
who
was
going
in
and
out
of
the
united
states
at
that
time
then
it
would
not
have
made
much
sense
to
talk
in
terms
of
an
exemption
for
--
to
travel
to
a
particular
country.
that
indicates
that
what
congress
did
have
in
mind
and
what
it
did
contemplate
and
what
it
knew
about
was
that
the
president
would
be
or
the
secretary
of
state
would
be
dealing
with
the
destinations
of
travelers
in
his
regulations
as
well
as
with
who
was
permitted
to
cross
the
border.
specific
reference,
we
think
to
the
broad
power
concurred
on
the
president
and
the
secretary,
appears
for
example
on
page
3
of
the
house
report.
that
report
says
and
i
quote,
"it
is
essential
to
meet
the
situation
that
the
executive
should
have
wide
discretion
and
wide
authority
of
action.
no
one
can
foresee
the
different
means
which
may
be
adopted
by
hostile
nations
to
secure
military
information
or
spread
propaganda
and
discontent.
now
of
course
again,
congress
was
concerned
primarily
and
we
don't
challenge
this.
congress
was
concerned
primarily
with
the
entry
of
foreign
agents
or
the
exit
of
foreign
agents.
but
we
think
it
also
intended
to
authorize
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
state
to
deal
with
the
kinds
of
restrictions
which
the
department
of
state
had
on
its
own
instituted
as
of
1914
in
effect.
from
1914
through
to
the
end
of
world
war
i,
passports
were
endorsed
in
the
restrictive
manner
as
appears
on
the
footnote
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
and
in
the
senate
as
well,
senator
shields,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
reported
out
this
bill,
specifically
referred
to
it
as
legislation
so
broad
in
principle
and
so
flexible
that
they
can
be
adopted
by
the
president
and
those
whom
he
will
authorize
to
enforce
them
to
any
particular
conditions
adopted
by
the
president
to
any
particular
conditions.
so
although
the
proponents
of
the
bill
did
not
refer
specifically
to
area
restrictions,
we
think
that
they
intended
to
comprehend
them
within
the
power
that
they
gave
to
the
secretary
to
determine
what
is
in
effect
a
valid
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
--
that
the
administrative
interpretation
is
by
no
means
is
a
--
as
a
simple
or
one
sided
as
petitioner
contends.
essentially,
what
the
administrative
interpretation
comes
down
to
are
three
pronouncements
by
the
secretary
--
by
the
department
of
state
in
various
times,
one
in
1919;
the
second
in
1952,
when
restrictions
were
imposed
on
travel
to
various
iron
curtain
countries,
and
then
an
answer
to
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
in
1957.
now
1919
--
let
me
go
back
to
that
1918
statute.
the
1918
statute
applied
by
its
own
terms
when
the
united
states
is
at
war.
now
it
was
made,
departure
from
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport
and
a
crime
when
the
only
--
only
when
the
united
states
is
at
war.
now,
it's
true
that
the
statement
issued
by
the
department
of
state
at
the
time
that
it
continued
to
impose
travel
restrictions
to
germany
in
1919,
did
not
specifically
refer
to
section
--
what
is
now
section
1185.
but
we
think
it's
substantially
doubtful
as
to
whether
that
section
could
even
have
applied
in
1919,
although
there
had
been
no
formal
peace
treaty.
but
in
1919
united
states
was
not
at
war.
the
hostilities
have
in
effect
ceased.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
would
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
you
don't
know
whether
somebody
is
going
to
cuba.
the
application
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
application
for
passport
has
in
it
a
box
which
an
applicant
must
fill
--
the
applicant
is
asked
to
fill
out
as
to
the
countries
to
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
no.
but
there's
no
requirement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
well,
there
--
there
are
other
statutes
--
there's
no
question.
there's
another
statute
which
would
make
it
a
crime
--
what
makes
it
crime
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
obtain
a
passport
by
false
statement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
what
we
think
--
first
of
all,
i
think
that
that
there
is
no,
since
a
passport
once
issued
can
be
used
for
a
period
of
time.
you
received
a
passport.
you
can
use
it
for
three
years.
now,
an
individual
who
receives
a
passport
this
year
for
example,
1966,
made
entirely
truthful
answer
that
the
trip
that
he
is
intending
today
is
to
go
to
france.
but
then
he
comes
back
and
five
months
later
without
having
to
applied
any
additional
passport,
he
travels
to
cuba.
now
the
criminal
sanction
is
necessary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
all
outstanding
passports
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no.
i
think
we'd
have
--
we'd
have
trouble
with
that
too
because
people
--
what
the
statute
is
designed
to
reach
mr.
justice
white,
are
the
people
who
don't
care
about
whether
they
have
the
protection
of
united
states.
and
that's
it
--
that's
a
substantial
interest
to
the
government
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
zemel.
the
restriction
on
travel
to
cuba
is
really,
really
has
i
think
a
dual
purpose.
one,
as
a
result
of
the
problem
that
cuba
presents
in
the
western
hemisphere,
the
organization
of
american
states
in
meetings
in
1962,
1963
determine
that
it
was
or
had
found
at
that
time
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
a
real
threat
or
danger
of
people
traveling
within
the
western
hemisphere.
let's
say
from
the
united
states
to
cuba
or
from
some
other
country
to
cuba
to
be
trained
for
revolutionary
activity
in
some
other
country
in
the
western
hemisphere.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
with
that
--
that
one
trip
is
quite
a
dangerous
one
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
we
could
revoke
their
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
did
with
mrs.
travis,
that's
true.
but
that
one
trip
for
the
person
who
is
interested
in
or
whose
views
are
such
that
he
would
like
to
participate
in
a
--
into
revolution
in
south
america
and
then
he
then
goes
from
the
united
states
to
cuba
for
that
purpose.
the
damage
is
done.
if
he
goes
there
and
he
knows
that
he
is
not
subject
to
any
criminal
punishment.
he
really
doesn't
care
whether
she
has
the
protection
of
united
states.
a
second
interest
i
think
is
one
which
is
caught
also
very
specifically
referred
to
in
general
and
that
is
that
we
try
to
impose
area
restrictions
on
those
countries
where
we
don't
have
diplomatic
relations,
and
where
we
believe
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
american
citizens
who
travel
there
would
be
harassed
or
detained
against
their
will.
now,
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
illusory
or
imaginary.
the
history
of
the
state
department's
restrictions
are
substantially
demonstrate
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
today
we've
been
advised
by
the
state
department
there
a
thousand
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
in
cuba
and
who
are
being
detained
against
there
will,
although,
they
voluntarily
chose
not
to
leave
for
an
earlier
point
in
time.
now,
these
again
are
people
who
knew
very
well
the
time
that
made
this
choice
that
they
could
not
leave
and
yet
they
now
find
themselves
in
a
position
where
they're
unable
to
leave
from
where
the
government
by
reason
of
certainly
both
legally
and
morally.
the
government
of
this
country
is
obliged
to
take
whatever
step
short
of
war
can
be
taken
to
effectuate
their
release.
22
u.s.c.
1732,
specifically
provide
that
the
president
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
the
possibility
that
a
group
of
60
or
80
such
were
--
such
as
were
involved
in
the
travel
involved
in
the
laub
case
could
have
been
detained
and
then
the
responsibility
would
have
fall
on
the
united
states
despite
the
fact
that
they
knew
they
could
not
be
protected
in
cuba.
the
responsibility
would
have
fallen
on
the
united
states
to
take
means
to
effectuate
their
release
with
the
possibility
of
dangerous
international
incidents
of
various
kinds.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
--
i
think
probably
the
department
of
state
believes
that
the
danger
exist
even
with
regard
to
them
but
it
feels
certainly
that
other
interests
may
be
out
weigh
that
danger
and
that
it
would
be
justified
in
particular
circumstances
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
danger
exist
to
allow
them
the
travel.
i
think
it's
really
a
balancing
of
--
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
state
of
what
the
various
interests
are.
newspaper
men
should
be
allowed
or
at
least
the
state
department
feels
it
should
be
allowed
--
they
should
be
allowed
access
to
cuba
to
be
able
to
in
the
interest
of
the
free
press
to
be
able
to
report
on
the
conditions
there.
and
the
same
is
true
for
people
who
might
have
to
go
there
for
humanitarian
reasons
or
the
department
of
state
for
substantial
period
of
time
after
the
imposition
of
the
restrictions
in
this
case
allowed
people
to
go
to
cuba
to
wind
up
businesses
which
they
had
business
interest
that
they
have
been
involved
with
in
cuba.
so
that,
all
these
really
mr.
chief
justice
are
--
involved
a
balancing
of
interest
in
each
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
the
justification
that
congress
had
in
just
passing
the
statute
and
i
think
in
allowing
it
to
continue
is
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
congress
just
felt
that
necessity
required
that
that
it
couldn't
pass
on
every
--
on
every
instance
and
that
maybe
it
couldn't
even
set
up
all
the
standards
by
which
he
might
determine
who
it
is
who
could
travel
that
that
they
might
vary
with
circumstances
and
they
might
vary
from
country
to
country.
there
are
at
present,
five
countries
or
five
areas
on
the
list
to
which
travel
is
prohibited.
now,
this
--
the
number
of
countries
on
that
list
is
varied
and
the
circumstances
may
vary
substantially.
as
i've
said
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
it
would
apply
to
the
standards
which
would
be
applied
to
individuals
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
the
secretary
might
say
that
the
standards
which
i
should
apply
in
determining
who
should
travel
to
cuba
are
quite
different
from
the
standards
which
i
might
apply
in
determining
who
should
travel
to
say
albania
or
who
should
travel
to
north
vietnam
because
the
conditions
are
different.
if
congress
would
have
enacted
the
statute
which
would
enumerate
the
conditions,
it
would
then
in
effect
impose
a
straightjacket
on
the
secretary
not
permitting
him
to
adjust
to
the
varying
conditions
which
might
be
necessary
from
country
to
country.
and
the
--
i
think
the
secretary
though
has
in
order
to
meet
these
problems
attempted
to
draft
regulations
which
at
least
in
broad
outline
state
the
conditions
under
which
he
will
grant
permission
to
travel
to
restricted
areas
and
conditions
factored
and
she
will
take
into
account
and
determine
whether
the
ground
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
the
regulation
--
it
was
not
in
effect,
i
must
say
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
in
this
case.
this
is
a
regulation
which
the
secretary
has
issued
--
it
appears
in
31
federal
register
13544
and
it's
--
it
specifically
provides
that
the
applications
for
validation
of
passports
for
travels
through
a
restricted
country
would
be
considered
in
the
national
interest
if
the
applicant
were
a
professional
reporter,
if
he
were
a
doctor
or
scientist
who
is
interested
in
furthering
his
medical
or
scientific
research
or
if
he
were
a
scholar
with
a
post
graduate
degree
who
is
also
interested
in
doing
that
or
if
he
were
representative
of
the
american
red
cross.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
those
categories
mr.
justice
black
are
in
effect
i
think,
the
secretary
being
bound
by
his
regulations
under
this
court's
opinion
in
(inaudible).
those
are
classifications
in
which
the
secretary
has
said
that
--
he
said
an
application
for
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
would
be
he
said
an
application
will
be
considered
to
be
in
the
national
interest
if
its
one
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
maybe
subject
to
some
debate.
i
--
just
from
the
face
of
it,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
now
there's
another
classification
in
the
regulation
which
specifically
says
that
--
which
refers
to
applications
which
might
be
in
the
national
interest
and
those
to
that
list,
other
people
who
are
in
the
news
media,
the
people
who
are
in
cultural
athletic
commercial
or
educational
activities
who
have
some
humanitarian
considerations
such
as
some
family
in
cuba
or
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
those
he
would
let
go
that
he
wants
to
go
passing
on
the
individual
case,
the
individual
instance
from
case
to
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
can
only
read
the
regulation
really
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
regulation
appears
to
indicate
that
he
would
have
to
grant
permission
to
a
professional
news
reporter.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
--
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
i
really
do
not
know.
no,
i'm
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
this
regulation
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
really
don't
--
i
--
could
i
respond
to
that
tomorrow
mr.
chief
justice
because
i
really
don't
know
the
answer.
i
can
try
and
find
that
out
over
the
recess.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i'm
advised
that
the
newspaper
reporters
applications
are
not
denied
that
even
--
that
a
reporter
for
the
communist
worker
was
--
his
passport
was
validated
for
a
travel
to
cuba.
so
that
is
a
matter
of
course
they
are
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
really
get
in
the
laub
--
a
full
answer
to
that
and
i'll
try
to
do
that
by
tomorrow
morning.
is
that's
alright?
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
one
immediately
following
it,
concern
the
meaning
and
constitutionality
of
section
215
(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
which
mr.
mcternan
has
been
referring
to
as
section
1185
because
it's
that
so
numbered
in
title
8.
that
provision
was
first
enacted
in
world
war
i
in
1918,
reenacted
with
a
slight
modification
just
prior
to
our
entering
into
world
war
ii
and
took
its
present
form
at
the
time
of
the
korean
war.
section
215
(b)
in
pertinent
part
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
and
i
quote,
"when
the
united
states
is
at
war
or
during
the
existence
of
any
national
emergency
proclaimed
by
the
president
after
the
president
has
also
proclaimed
that
additional
restrictions
on
departure
or
entry
are
needed
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states."
and
here
again
i
quote,
"to
depart
from
the
united
states
unless
he
bears
a
valid
passport."
the
statute
provides
that
this
prohibition
is
to
apply,
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
president
and
subject
to
such
limitations
and
exceptions
as
the
president
may
authorize
and
prescribed."
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner's
departure
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
secretary
of
state
mr.
justice
black
has
been
delegating
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
regulations
of
this
kind
generally
go
through
the
secretary
of
state.
they
may
begin
at
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
and
the
passport
office
of
the
bureau.
but
they
go
up
through
the
secretary.
i
don't
think
that
these
restrictions
are
ever
imposed
or
a
country
is
ever
added
to
the
list
of
those
to
which
travelers
restricted
without
the
approval
of
the
secretary
or
the
very
least
of
the
undersecretary,
i
think
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
delegation
--
yes.
well,
the
secretary
is
authorized
by
--
i
forgot
exactly
the
section
but
there's
a
section
in
title
5
which
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state
to
exercise
foreign
policy
functions
which
are
delegated
by
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
a
certain
sentence
from
the
president
to
the
secretary
sir,
i
mean
a
certain
sense,
congress
has
made
that
delegation
by
passing
the
statute
which
appears
in
title
5.
within
the
department
of
state,
those
delegations
are
of
course
made
by
department
regulations.
i
imagine
the
secretary
of
state
or
i'm
not
sure
exactly
who
the
official
is
in
the
state
department
who
structures
the
delegation's
authorizations
within
that
department.
but
certainly,
any
authorizations
from
the
secretary
to
the
undersecretary
is
made
by
--
i
would
imagine
a
formal
state
department
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
as
i
hoped
to
point
out
in
my
argument
what
this
--
all
that
the
congress
has
made
a
crime
is
departing
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
under
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
secretary's
issuance
of
passports.
in
other
words,
the
secretary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
black
but
we
think
that
that
in
every
respect
is
very
much
like
the
delegation
that
exists
for
example
when
a
statute
says
that
it's
an
offense
to
drive
an
automobile
without
a
valid
operator's
license.
now,
they
maybe
people
within
the
commission
of
motor
vehicles
who
will
be
drawing
up
regulations
and
determining
how
long
or
what
a
--
a
driving
license
is
effective?
what
its
terms
are?
whether
the
holder
of
it
must
be
wearing
eyeglasses?
how
he
can
drive?
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely.
but
we
think
that
congress'
enactment
of
the
statute
does
nothing
more
mr.
justice
black
than
simply
say
that
when
you
leave
the
united
states,
you
must
have
in
your
hand
an
authorization
under
the
authority
that's
been
delegated
to
the
secretary
which
permits
him
to
issue
passports.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
and
the
kind
of
regulations
that
are
involved
here,
i
might
just
add
mr.
justice
black,
of
course
those
that
this
court
explicitly
sustain
against
an
attack
based
on
delegation
in
the
zemel
case.
so
that
in
terms
of
delegation,
we
think
that
that
the
zemel
case
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
case
on
the
delegation
issue
does
control
this
one.
in
other
words,
what
it
does
say
is
that
the
secretary
maybe
delegated
the
power
to
make
this
kind
of
a
condition
or
this
kind
of
a
restriction
upon
the
validity
of
the
passport
and
that's
all
the
secretary
does.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
rely
entirely
on
that
in
terms
of
the
power
which
the
secretary
has
to
impose
conditions
or
in
effect
set
out
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
rely
on
that
act
insofar,
yes.
insofar
as
that
act
authorizes
and
i
hope
to
elaborate
this
really
similar
--
more
in
my
argument
because
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
state
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
if
i
may,
what
the
powers
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
that
were
exercised
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no
we
rely
--
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
rely
--
in
terms
of
the
secretary
setting
of
conditions,
we
rely
on
the
26th
act.
on
the
other
hand,
in
terms
of
the
secretary's
providing
as
you
put
it
in
exception
to
an
exception
of
course,
we
rely
entirely
on
section
1185.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
and
in
that
sense,
we
think
that
the
--
that
what
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
rely
in
the
19
--
yes.
we
rely
in
the
1926
act
so
far
as
this
authority
is
concerned.
we
rely
on
section
1185
so
far
as
whether
it's
a
criminal
offense.
in
other
words,
we're
saying
what
section
1185
did
was
it
said
that
the
authority
that
the
secretary
exercises
under
the
1926
act
is
to
impose
conditions
or
in
anyway
to
restrict
a
validity
of
a
passport.
congress
in
the
19
--
in
section
1185
said,
"if
anybody
departs
the
united
states
with
a
passport
that
the
secretary
declares
under
his
authority,
under
the
1926
act
has
being
invalid,
that
person
just
committed
a
crime."
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
maybe
i've
misunderstood
your
question.
i
definitely
--
to
that
extent,
we
certainly
rely
on
the
--
on
section
215
(b)
or
section
1185.
in
other
words,
what
we're
saying
is,
congress
having
recognized
that
it
delegated
power
to
the
secretary
then
provided,
at
times
of
war,
both
in
world
war
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
the
secretary
did
think
he
was
exercising
authority
under
section
1185
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
as
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
the
--
i
think
that
--.
as
that
appears
in
the
federal
register
mr.
justice
white,
and
we
try
to
point
that
out
in
our
brief.
it
does
have
the
reference
to
section
1185
(and
under
the
rules
of
construction
that
the
federal
register
of
the
code
of
federal
regulation
provides
that
is
whatever
appears
in
small
print)
is
part
of
the
authority
relied
upon.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no
at
55
what
--
that
gives
the
form
of
the
public
notice
as
it
was
issued
on
january
16,
1961.
(voice
overlap)but
the
--
at
page
38
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
the
reference
in
the
federal
register
which
does
have
section
215,
8
u.s.c.
1185
following
the
text
of
the
amended
regulations.
and
also
refer
there
to
the
provision
in
1
cfr
xxvi
which
provides
that
each
section
of
the
code
is
followed
by
the
citation
of
the
statutory
authority
under
the
section
decision.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
whether
travis
would
think
that
it
was
--
and
again
i
hope
to
develop
this
in
the
argument
that
whether
travis
would
think
that
this
public
notice
specifically
rely
on
section
1185
is
really
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
she
had
notice
of
the
restriction
and
of
the
fact
that
she
could
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
--
there
is
no
men
--
there's
no
enumeration
in
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
of
any
standards
whatever?
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
at
large.
i
must
say
--
i
think
the
department
of
state
itself
was
concern
over
this
at
large
delegation
and
has
since
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
true
but
--
since
these
cases
mr.
justice
black
and
the
department
of
state
has
issued
regulations
specifically
enumerating
the
standards
on
--
which
the
secretary
exercise
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
congress
did
not
do
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
secretary
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
of
course
the
secretary
is
bound
under
this
court's
decisions
by
his
own
regulations
and
he
can't
depart
from
that.
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true
but
the
only
limitation
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
passport
--
and
this
i
think
was
congress'
purpose.
congress
was
saying
that
you
need
in
times
of
war
a
passport
which
the
secretary
declares
to
be
valid.
and
left
to
the
secretary
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
left
to
the
secretary
to
determine
what
the
standards
of
validity
would
be.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
by
necessity
really
what
congress
left
to
the
secretary
was
the
choice
of
the
countries.
we
--
i
think
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
zemel
opinion
that
this
practice
have
been
one
of
long
standards
of
the
secretary
of
the
state.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
gave
no
general
standards
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
the
only
reason
for
that
was
that
it
felt
that
he
couldn't
really
anticipate
what
the
problems
are
that
might
arise
which
might
cause
or
require
area
restrictions
in
various
instances.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
a
broad
standard
mr.
justice
black.
our
defense
of
it
is
only
that
it's
--
it
was
the
congress
may
have
felt
that
it
was
necessary
in
time
of
war
and
these
were
war
time
statutes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it's
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
she
had
a
passport,
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
read
it
a
little
bit
more
generically
or
broader
than
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
say
unless
he
bears
the
passport
which
is
valid
for
his
travel
which
includes
the
country
to
which
he
goes,
the
purpose
of
this
travel.
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
think
that
all
that
we're
saying
is
that
when
you
have
--
when
he
travel,
has
in
his
hand
the
passport
and
the
passport
has
on
it,
in
its
present
form
a
page
specifically
on
which
the
department
of
state
can
endorse
extensions,
amendments,
limitations
and
restrictions
and
it
has
traditionally
in
a
passport
endorsed
restrictions
in
terms
of
the
validity
of
a
passport.
in
other
words,
if
it
said
that
this
passport
is
not
valid
unless
signed.
or
as
another
illustration,
one
of
the
department
of
states
passport
forms
is
an
official
passport
which
can
be
used
by
government
officials
going
abroad.
now
that
passport
specifically
provide
--
this
passport
is
valid
for
travel
abroad
only
while
the
bearer
thereof
maintains
the
official
status
which
the
passport
was
issued
or
endorsed.
our
argument
is
that
the
secretary
of
state
had
issued
a
document
which
--
in
which
he
has
said
that
this
document
is
in
effect
no
passport
if
you
violate
that
term.
if
an
official
who
had
a
passport,
an
official
passport,
one
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
unofficial
--
the
regular
passports
contains
a
legend
which
says,
"this
passport
is
not
valid
for
travel
to
or
in
communist
controlled
portions
of
china,
korea,
vietnam
or
to
or
in
albania
or
cuba."
in
other
words,
the
secretary
of
state
has
said
by
the
very
document
which
she
is
authorized
to
issue
under
the
statute
that
this
is
not
the
official
document
it
may
look
like
if
you
use
it
for
certain
kinds
of
travel.
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mrs.
travis,
if
she
left
with
this
document
on
a
trip,
on
a
voyage
to
cuba,
was
leaving
with
the
document
which
by
its
own
terms
revoked
it
or
(inaudible)
it
(voice
overlap)
such
a
print.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
her
argument,
yes.
but
we
say
that
she
should
--
knew
or
should
have
known
that
any
conditions
of
validity
which
the
secretary
of
state
imposes
in
the
document
which
authorized
her
to
leave
are
by
the
terms
of
this
statute
of
1185
must
be
met
at
the
time
of
her
departure.
and
if
the
secretary
of
state
had
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
during
mr.
mcternan's
argument,
issued
separate
passports
for
every
destination
in
the
world.
and
had
said,
well,
if
you
want
to
go
to
cuba,
if
you
want
to
go
to
france,
you
must
get
a
passport
a
or
passport
b
and
somebody
attempted
to
leave
the
united
states
on
a
trip
to
france
with
a
passport
which
was
only
good
to
cuba
then
we
say
that
person
would
have
been
violating
1185
and
we
finally
have
known
it
because
he
would
have
known
by
the
terms
of
his
own
passport
that
it
was
not
valid
for
the
trip
which
he
was
taking.
in
addition,
the
--
we
think
that
what
really
makes
that
quite
clear
for
section
1185
is
the
fact
that
section
1185
by
its
history
is
a
war
time
or
emergency
statute.
it
was
enacted
in
world
war
i.
it
was
reenacted
in
world
war
ii
and
then
at
the
time
the
korean
war.
both
during
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
the
laub
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
no
---
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
can't
say
that
mrs.
travis
had
her
passports.
but
the
laub
defendants
in
there
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
understand.
no.
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mrs.
travis
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
1962,
the
passport
would
have
said
this,
precisely
would
have
had
that
legend
on
it.
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
facts
are
if
i
can
maybe
just
clarify,
if
i
say
things
may
be
we
--
they're
not
specifically
in
the
record.
but
the
facts
are
that
mrs.
travis
had
a
revoked
passport.
she
had
a
passport
with
this
issued
back
in
1958.
it
did
not
--
at
1958
that
legend
was
not
on
the
passport.
that
passport
had
been
revoked
by
the
department
of
state.
she
had
received
a
letter
from
the
state
department
advising
her
that
her
passport
had
been
revoked
and
was
no
longer
valid.
that
was
the
only
document
of
that
kind
that
she
had
in
her
possession
at
the
time
that
she
made
these
trips.
mr.
nathan
lewin
she
does
not
now
have
a
passport
so
far
as
i
know.
she
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
she
traveled
in
violation
of
the
state
department's
area
restriction
to
communist
china
and
the
--
for
that
reason,
her
passport
then
was
used
a
broad
mark
valid
only
for
return
to
the
united
states
and
after
her
return
to
the
united
states
her
passport
was
officially
revoked
by
notice
sent
to
her
from
the
state
department.
mr.
nathan
lewin
five
years.
mr.
nathan
lewin
five
years
and
a
$5,000
fine.
the
statute
as
i
said
is
a
war
time
measure
and
what
in
our
view
makes
that
--
what
in
our
view
makes
that
particularly
important
is
the
fact
that
both
during
world
war
i
and
during
world
war
ii,
it
was
the
policy
of
the
department
of
state
to
issue
passports
precisely
of
a
kind
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to.
they
were
passports
which
on
the
page
dedicated
to
renewals,
extensions,
amendments,
limitations,
and
restrictions.
the
department
of
state
endorsed
a
restriction
which
made
that
passport
valid
only
for
a
particular
destination
and
for
a
specific
purpose.
in
other
words,
these
were
war
time
restrictions
on
travel
abroad.
a
time
that
there
were
hostilities
in
europe,
a
passport
for
example
issued
in
the
1944
or
1945,
specifically
stated
on
that
page
that
the
passport
was
"not
valid
for
travel
in
any
country
except"and
then
listed
the
passport
to
which
it
was
valid
and
the
purposes
of
which
it
was
valid.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
justice
fortas
that
they
did
go
to
congress.
that
it
was
precisely
in
order
to
give
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
president
as
the
statute
puts
it,
broad
powers
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
might
arise
in
war
time
that
the
statute
was
passed.
and
it
was
passed
through
the
congress
that
had
knowledge
of
this
kind
of
restrictions.
and
that's
why
we
think
that
the
restrictions
are
relevant
because
when
congress
said,
a
pass
--
you
must
--
you
may
not
depart
the
united
states
without
a
valid
a
passport.
we
submit
it
had
knowledge
of
this
practice
of
the
department
of
state
and
that
it
was
in
effect
incorporating
those
kinds
of
standards
of
validity
into
the
statute
which
it
passed.
now,
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
debates
and
the
reports
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
original
of
--
statute
which
is
a
predecessor
to
section
1185
in
1918
at
the
time
of
world
war
i.
well,
there
is
no
question
--
this
is
the
only
--
this
is
the
extent
of
our
concession
but
mr.
mcternan
has
attributed
to
us
a
concession
that
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
cover
this
or
that
the
legislative
history
does.
we
don't
concede
that
for
any
means.
we
think
the
statute
on
its
face
does
make
this
a
crime.
now,
the
legislative
history
supports
the
proposition
that
congress
was
delegating
to
the
president,
to
the
secretary
of
state
the
powers
which
it
felt
that
president
and
secretary
of
state
had
to
exercise
in
this
kind
of
circumstances.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
do
concede
that
the
discussions
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
the
house
and
the
house
reports
did
not
specifically
refer
the
area
restrictions
of
such.
in
other
words,
they
at
no
point
in
the
house
--
there's
really
only
one
house
report.
that's
all
what
there
is
on
this
bill
and
its
three
pages
long
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
the
senate
report
just
has
a
few
technical
amendments
which
were
reported
out
of
the
senate
committee.
they
are
in
i
was
told
about
25
to
30
pages
of
floor
debate.
the
main
focus
of
congress'
concern
at
the
time
was
that
the
executive
had
to
have
some
way
of
controlling
who
is
coming
in
and
who
is
going
out
of
the
united
states.
but
it's
also
clear,
we
submit
from
both
the
discussion
on
the
floor
and
from
the
house
reports
that
it
was
congress'
intention
to
make
a
broad
delegation
as
broad
as
it
constitutionally
could
to
these
president
and
the
secretary
to
deal
with
war
time
exit
and
entry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
never
referred
to
area
restriction.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
on
the
floor,
almost
all
the
discussions
was
devoted
to
whether
the
statute
would
cover
a
--
would
cover
a
movement
from
the
united
states
to
canada
and
back
from
canada
to
united
states.
and
most
representatives
and
senators
from
the
northern
states
were
concern
that
their
constituents
might
in
some
way
be
subjected
to
criminal
sanctions
because
they
were
going
to
canada
without
a
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
--
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
assurance
is
that
were
given
at
the
time
though,
we
submit,
were
indicated
that
the
president
would
have
the
authority
by
the
exception
provisions
of
section
1185
to
accept
canada
from
the
reach
of
the
statute.
well,
to
that
extent
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
submit
that
this
was
an
indication
that
this
is
not
merely
a
border
control
statute
because
specifically
what
the
congress
was
focusing
on
was
whether
people
would
be
able
to
go
to
canada
and
whether
the
president
would
be
able
to
make
exceptions
for
travel
to
canada.
now
if
as
petitioner
contends
and
as
the
defendants
in
laub
contend,
this
--
the
statute
were
merely
a
border
control
measure
and
the
only
thing
that
the
congress
was
interested
in
was
in
having
some
way
in
which
the
secretary
of
state
could
pass
on
who
was
going
in
and
out
of
the
united
states
at
that
time
then
it
would
not
have
made
much
sense
to
talk
in
terms
of
an
exemption
for
--
to
travel
to
a
particular
country.
that
indicates
that
what
congress
did
have
in
mind
and
what
it
did
contemplate
and
what
it
knew
about
was
that
the
president
would
be
or
the
secretary
of
state
would
be
dealing
with
the
destinations
of
travelers
in
his
regulations
as
well
as
with
who
was
permitted
to
cross
the
border.
specific
reference,
we
think
to
the
broad
power
concurred
on
the
president
and
the
secretary,
appears
for
example
on
page
3
of
the
house
report.
that
report
says
and
i
quote,
"it
is
essential
to
meet
the
situation
that
the
executive
should
have
wide
discretion
and
wide
authority
of
action.
no
one
can
foresee
the
different
means
which
may
be
adopted
by
hostile
nations
to
secure
military
information
or
spread
propaganda
and
discontent.
now
of
course
again,
congress
was
concerned
primarily
and
we
don't
challenge
this.
congress
was
concerned
primarily
with
the
entry
of
foreign
agents
or
the
exit
of
foreign
agents.
but
we
think
it
also
intended
to
authorize
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
state
to
deal
with
the
kinds
of
restrictions
which
the
department
of
state
had
on
its
own
instituted
as
of
1914
in
effect.
from
1914
through
to
the
end
of
world
war
i,
passports
were
endorsed
in
the
restrictive
manner
as
appears
on
the
footnote
on
page
22
of
our
brief.
and
in
the
senate
as
well,
senator
shields,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
reported
out
this
bill,
specifically
referred
to
it
as
legislation
so
broad
in
principle
and
so
flexible
that
they
can
be
adopted
by
the
president
and
those
whom
he
will
authorize
to
enforce
them
to
any
particular
conditions
adopted
by
the
president
to
any
particular
conditions.
so
although
the
proponents
of
the
bill
did
not
refer
specifically
to
area
restrictions,
we
think
that
they
intended
to
comprehend
them
within
the
power
that
they
gave
to
the
secretary
to
determine
what
is
in
effect
a
valid
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
--
that
the
administrative
interpretation
is
by
no
means
is
a
--
as
a
simple
or
one
sided
as
petitioner
contends.
essentially,
what
the
administrative
interpretation
comes
down
to
are
three
pronouncements
by
the
secretary
--
by
the
department
of
state
in
various
times,
one
in
1919;
the
second
in
1952,
when
restrictions
were
imposed
on
travel
to
various
iron
curtain
countries,
and
then
an
answer
to
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
in
1957.
now
1919
--
let
me
go
back
to
that
1918
statute.
the
1918
statute
applied
by
its
own
terms
when
the
united
states
is
at
war.
now
it
was
made,
departure
from
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport
and
a
crime
when
the
only
--
only
when
the
united
states
is
at
war.
now,
it's
true
that
the
statement
issued
by
the
department
of
state
at
the
time
that
it
continued
to
impose
travel
restrictions
to
germany
in
1919,
did
not
specifically
refer
to
section
--
what
is
now
section
1185.
but
we
think
it's
substantially
doubtful
as
to
whether
that
section
could
even
have
applied
in
1919,
although
there
had
been
no
formal
peace
treaty.
but
in
1919
united
states
was
not
at
war.
the
hostilities
have
in
effect
ceased.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
would
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
you
don't
know
whether
somebody
is
going
to
cuba.
the
application
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
application
for
passport
has
in
it
a
box
which
an
applicant
must
fill
--
the
applicant
is
asked
to
fill
out
as
to
the
countries
to
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
no.
but
there's
no
requirement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
well,
there
--
there
are
other
statutes
--
there's
no
question.
there's
another
statute
which
would
make
it
a
crime
--
what
makes
it
crime
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
obtain
a
passport
by
false
statement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
what
we
think
--
first
of
all,
i
think
that
that
there
is
no,
since
a
passport
once
issued
can
be
used
for
a
period
of
time.
you
received
a
passport.
you
can
use
it
for
three
years.
now,
an
individual
who
receives
a
passport
this
year
for
example,
1966,
made
entirely
truthful
answer
that
the
trip
that
he
is
intending
today
is
to
go
to
france.
but
then
he
comes
back
and
five
months
later
without
having
to
applied
any
additional
passport,
he
travels
to
cuba.
now
the
criminal
sanction
is
necessary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
all
outstanding
passports
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no.
i
think
we'd
have
--
we'd
have
trouble
with
that
too
because
people
--
what
the
statute
is
designed
to
reach
mr.
justice
white,
are
the
people
who
don't
care
about
whether
they
have
the
protection
of
united
states.
and
that's
it
--
that's
a
substantial
interest
to
the
government
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
zemel.
the
restriction
on
travel
to
cuba
is
really,
really
has
i
think
a
dual
purpose.
one,
as
a
result
of
the
problem
that
cuba
presents
in
the
western
hemisphere,
the
organization
of
american
states
in
meetings
in
1962,
1963
determine
that
it
was
or
had
found
at
that
time
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
a
real
threat
or
danger
of
people
traveling
within
the
western
hemisphere.
let's
say
from
the
united
states
to
cuba
or
from
some
other
country
to
cuba
to
be
trained
for
revolutionary
activity
in
some
other
country
in
the
western
hemisphere.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
with
that
--
that
one
trip
is
quite
a
dangerous
one
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
we
could
revoke
their
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
did
with
mrs.
travis,
that's
true.
but
that
one
trip
for
the
person
who
is
interested
in
or
whose
views
are
such
that
he
would
like
to
participate
in
a
--
into
revolution
in
south
america
and
then
he
then
goes
from
the
united
states
to
cuba
for
that
purpose.
the
damage
is
done.
if
he
goes
there
and
he
knows
that
he
is
not
subject
to
any
criminal
punishment.
he
really
doesn't
care
whether
she
has
the
protection
of
united
states.
a
second
interest
i
think
is
one
which
is
caught
also
very
specifically
referred
to
in
general
and
that
is
that
we
try
to
impose
area
restrictions
on
those
countries
where
we
don't
have
diplomatic
relations,
and
where
we
believe
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
american
citizens
who
travel
there
would
be
harassed
or
detained
against
their
will.
now,
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
illusory
or
imaginary.
the
history
of
the
state
department's
restrictions
are
substantially
demonstrate
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
today
we've
been
advised
by
the
state
department
there
a
thousand
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
in
cuba
and
who
are
being
detained
against
there
will,
although,
they
voluntarily
chose
not
to
leave
for
an
earlier
point
in
time.
now,
these
again
are
people
who
knew
very
well
the
time
that
made
this
choice
that
they
could
not
leave
and
yet
they
now
find
themselves
in
a
position
where
they're
unable
to
leave
from
where
the
government
by
reason
of
certainly
both
legally
and
morally.
the
government
of
this
country
is
obliged
to
take
whatever
step
short
of
war
can
be
taken
to
effectuate
their
release.
22
u.s.c.
1732,
specifically
provide
that
the
president
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
the
possibility
that
a
group
of
60
or
80
such
were
--
such
as
were
involved
in
the
travel
involved
in
the
laub
case
could
have
been
detained
and
then
the
responsibility
would
have
fall
on
the
united
states
despite
the
fact
that
they
knew
they
could
not
be
protected
in
cuba.
the
responsibility
would
have
fallen
on
the
united
states
to
take
means
to
effectuate
their
release
with
the
possibility
of
dangerous
international
incidents
of
various
kinds.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
--
i
think
probably
the
department
of
state
believes
that
the
danger
exist
even
with
regard
to
them
but
it
feels
certainly
that
other
interests
may
be
out
weigh
that
danger
and
that
it
would
be
justified
in
particular
circumstances
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
danger
exist
to
allow
them
the
travel.
i
think
it's
really
a
balancing
of
--
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
state
of
what
the
various
interests
are.
newspaper
men
should
be
allowed
or
at
least
the
state
department
feels
it
should
be
allowed
--
they
should
be
allowed
access
to
cuba
to
be
able
to
in
the
interest
of
the
free
press
to
be
able
to
report
on
the
conditions
there.
and
the
same
is
true
for
people
who
might
have
to
go
there
for
humanitarian
reasons
or
the
department
of
state
for
substantial
period
of
time
after
the
imposition
of
the
restrictions
in
this
case
allowed
people
to
go
to
cuba
to
wind
up
businesses
which
they
had
business
interest
that
they
have
been
involved
with
in
cuba.
so
that,
all
these
really
mr.
chief
justice
are
--
involved
a
balancing
of
interest
in
each
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
the
justification
that
congress
had
in
just
passing
the
statute
and
i
think
in
allowing
it
to
continue
is
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
congress
just
felt
that
necessity
required
that
that
it
couldn't
pass
on
every
--
on
every
instance
and
that
maybe
it
couldn't
even
set
up
all
the
standards
by
which
he
might
determine
who
it
is
who
could
travel
that
that
they
might
vary
with
circumstances
and
they
might
vary
from
country
to
country.
there
are
at
present,
five
countries
or
five
areas
on
the
list
to
which
travel
is
prohibited.
now,
this
--
the
number
of
countries
on
that
list
is
varied
and
the
circumstances
may
vary
substantially.
as
i've
said
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
it
would
apply
to
the
standards
which
would
be
applied
to
individuals
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
the
secretary
might
say
that
the
standards
which
i
should
apply
in
determining
who
should
travel
to
cuba
are
quite
different
from
the
standards
which
i
might
apply
in
determining
who
should
travel
to
say
albania
or
who
should
travel
to
north
vietnam
because
the
conditions
are
different.
if
congress
would
have
enacted
the
statute
which
would
enumerate
the
conditions,
it
would
then
in
effect
impose
a
straightjacket
on
the
secretary
not
permitting
him
to
adjust
to
the
varying
conditions
which
might
be
necessary
from
country
to
country.
and
the
--
i
think
the
secretary
though
has
in
order
to
meet
these
problems
attempted
to
draft
regulations
which
at
least
in
broad
outline
state
the
conditions
under
which
he
will
grant
permission
to
travel
to
restricted
areas
and
conditions
factored
and
she
will
take
into
account
and
determine
whether
the
ground
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
the
regulation
--
it
was
not
in
effect,
i
must
say
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
in
this
case.
this
is
a
regulation
which
the
secretary
has
issued
--
it
appears
in
31
federal
register
13544
and
it's
--
it
specifically
provides
that
the
applications
for
validation
of
passports
for
travels
through
a
restricted
country
would
be
considered
in
the
national
interest
if
the
applicant
were
a
professional
reporter,
if
he
were
a
doctor
or
scientist
who
is
interested
in
furthering
his
medical
or
scientific
research
or
if
he
were
a
scholar
with
a
post
graduate
degree
who
is
also
interested
in
doing
that
or
if
he
were
representative
of
the
american
red
cross.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
those
categories
mr.
justice
black
are
in
effect
i
think,
the
secretary
being
bound
by
his
regulations
under
this
court's
opinion
in
(inaudible).
those
are
classifications
in
which
the
secretary
has
said
that
--
he
said
an
application
for
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
would
be
he
said
an
application
will
be
considered
to
be
in
the
national
interest
if
its
one
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
maybe
subject
to
some
debate.
i
--
just
from
the
face
of
it,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
now
there's
another
classification
in
the
regulation
which
specifically
says
that
--
which
refers
to
applications
which
might
be
in
the
national
interest
and
those
to
that
list,
other
people
who
are
in
the
news
media,
the
people
who
are
in
cultural
athletic
commercial
or
educational
activities
who
have
some
humanitarian
considerations
such
as
some
family
in
cuba
or
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
those
he
would
let
go
that
he
wants
to
go
passing
on
the
individual
case,
the
individual
instance
from
case
to
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
can
only
read
the
regulation
really
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
regulation
appears
to
indicate
that
he
would
have
to
grant
permission
to
a
professional
news
reporter.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
--
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
i
really
do
not
know.
no,
i'm
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
this
regulation
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
really
don't
--
i
--
could
i
respond
to
that
tomorrow
mr.
chief
justice
because
i
really
don't
know
the
answer.
i
can
try
and
find
that
out
over
the
recess.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i'm
advised
that
the
newspaper
reporters
applications
are
not
denied
that
even
--
that
a
reporter
for
the
communist
worker
was
--
his
passport
was
validated
for
a
travel
to
cuba.
so
that
is
a
matter
of
course
they
are
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
really
get
in
the
laub
--
a
full
answer
to
that
and
i'll
try
to
do
that
by
tomorrow
morning.
is
that's
alright?
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you.
