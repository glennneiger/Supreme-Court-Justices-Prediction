mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
travis
here
stands
convicted
on
two
counts,
the
violation
of
title
8,
u.s.
code
section
1185
for
having
deported,
the
united
states
for
cuba
on
two
occasions
in
1962
without
a
valid
a
passport.
the
proof
by
stipulation
was
that
on
neither
occasion,
the
petitioner
have
and
i
quote,
"a
valid
united
states
passport
specifically
endorsed
for
travel
to
cuba."
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
at
all
as
to
whether
petitioner
had
an
otherwise
operative
passport.
so
the
evidence
shows
that
she
went
to
cuba
to
observe
the
living
and
working
conditions
of
the
people
and
the
effectuation
and
implementation
of
government
programs
dealing
with
health,
public
health,
housing,
education,
agriculture
industry.
the
fact
are
then
in
the
record
that
she
did
so
observed
and
take
photographs,
represented
a
copies
of
which
in
the
record.
and
upon
her
return,
she
reported
upon
her
observations
by
way
of
circular
letters
to
people
in
this
country
and
by
illustrated
lectures.
and
i
assume
from
the
decisions
in
(inaudible)
that
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
statutory
editing
in
section
1185
and
i
will
not
go
into
that
detail
unless
i'm
asked
to
sufficing
to
say
that
1185
replaced
two
earlier
statutes
which
in
pertinent
respects
here
were
identical.
there
were
prior
to
the
1952
enactment
of
section
1185
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
which
were
adopted
by
the
president
after
the
1952
statute
passed
in
proclamation
number
3004
which
is
set
forth
on
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
appendix
f.
and
these
regulations
provided
that
passports
would
not
be
required
for
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere.
in
1961,
the
so-called
excluding
cuba
amendment
was
adopted,
and
this
as
we
see
it
is
a
three
faceted
government
act
which
involved
a
regulation,
a
public
notice
and
a
press
release.
the
regulation
is
set
forth
at
appendix
b
of
our
brief.
it
states
in
terms
that
it
is
promulgated
under
an
executive
order
which
in
turn
was
based
upon
22
u.s.c.211
(a)
is
the
statute
involved
in
the
zemel
case.
it
does
not
say
that
it
was
promulgated
under
section
1185.
and
the
effect
of
it
was
to
exclude
cuba
from
the
exemption
in
the
earlier
regulations
pertaining
to
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere.
so
that
by
the
face
of
the
regulation
alone,
taking
it
by
itself,
a
passport
was
required
in
the
case
of
a
departure
for
cuba
just
as
it
were
had
been
required
for
a
departure
for
france,
or
burma,
or
cuba
and
whatever.
there
was
nothing
in
the
regulation
on
itself
which
required
a
special
endorsement
to
the
passport
for
cuba.
simultaneously,
with
the
promulgation
of
the
amendment
was
the
issuance
of
the
public
notice
that
is
set
forth
in
appendix
d
to
our
brief,
which
declared
existing
passports
invalid
for
cuba
and
provided
for
the
future
that
passports
not
be
valid
for
travel
to
cuba
unless
especially
endorsed
for
such
travel.
the
third
process
of
the
government
act
at
this
time
was
the
simultaneous
press
relief,
which
explained
the
government's
action
is
the
result
of
the
government's
inability
and
i
quote,
"to
extend
a
normal
protective
servicing
to
americans
traveling
in
--
or
visiting
in
cuba."
it
advised
that
the
specially
required
endorsement
for
passports
to
cuba
would
be
granted
only
to
persons,
"whose
travel
maybe
regarded
as
in
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states."
we
take
the
position
in
this
litigation,
if
the
court
please
that
the
regulations,
the
public
notice
and
the
press
release
are
an
integrated
scheme
to
regulate
travel
by
--
to
cuba
by
way
of
license
to
be
issued
in
a
total
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
state.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
our
first
position
namely
that
the
statute
does
not
authorize
the
imposition
of
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
area
travel
ban.
on
its
face
of
the
statute
and
i
now
refer
to
section
1185,
imposes
a
requirement
that
citizens
hold
a
valid
passports
at
the
time
they
cross
u.s.
borders
and
that
is
as
far
as
the
statute
goes.
the
face
of
the
statute
contains
no
reference
to
the
destination
of
it's
--
of
the
traveler
and
imposes
no
requirement
and
no
sanctions
related
to
the
destination
of
the
traveler.
as
applied
here,
the
government
would
read
the
statute
as
permitting
the
use
of
a
passport
requirement
with
a
purpose
of
prohibiting
travel
to
areas
declared
out
of
bounds
by
the
government.
and
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
as
we
think
it
is
written,
simply
a
border
control
regulation
or
whether
is
it
be
construed
as
we
think
the
government
would
construe
it
as
a
travel
to
regulation,
which
imposes
prohibitions
and
licenses
and
dependent
upon
the
destination
of
the
traveler.
our
position
rests
on
three
grounds
if
the
court
please.
first
on
the
face
of
the
statute
which
is
i've
already
pointed
out,
speaks
only
to
holding
a
passport
when
the
border
is
crossed
and
without
any
reference
to
destination
at
all.
the
second
point
of
our
position
here
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
discloses
a
purpose
to
impose
surveillance
and
control
over
border
crossing
specifically
and
articulately
directed
to
security
consideration
such
as
spies,
saboteurs
and
fugitives
in
justice.
and
as
our
legislative
history
shows,
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation
as
one
of
it
--
the
other
three
stages
at
which
it
was
enacted
specifically
said
that
it
was
not
directed
and
i
quote
again,
"it's
the
legitimate
travel
of
united
states
citizen."
the
third
ground
of
our
position
here
is
that
the
history
of
area
restrictions
as
developed
by
administrative
interpretation
and
application
shows
that
these
restrictions
has
been
consistently
regarded
as
unrelated
to
the
command
of
section
1185
as
not
armed
if
you
will
by
the
sanctions
of
section
1185.
i
said
consistently,
consistently
that
is
until
after
and
i
repeat,
after
the
excluding
cuba
regulations
was
adopted.
now,
it
appears
in
the
government's
brief
that
it
concedes
our
position
concerning
the
face
of
the
statute
and
it
concedes
our
position
concerning
the
legislative
history
and
i
do
not
discuss
this
here
unless
the
court
have
direct
questions
to
me
about
that.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
it
fact
--
in
fact,
it
does
not
deny
the
facts
that
we
present
on
administrative
construction,
although,
it
would
draw
from
different
inferences
from
it.
concerning
administrative
construction,
i
think
it's
important
to
observe
the
dual
function
of
a
passport
is
delineated
by
this
court
in
kent
against
dulles.
there,
the
court
spoke
first
the
function
of
the
passport
as
a
request
directed
to
foreign
government
for
the
safe
passage
of
the
traveler
and
secondly,
as
a
means
of
exit
control.
we
think
that
the
history
of
area
restrictions
developed
by
the
administrative
action
of
the
department
of
state
has
always
and
explicitly
acted
with
reference
to
the
request
for
safe
passage
function
alone.
without
going
into
the
details
of
the
administrative
construction
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
let
me
summarize
it
briefly
if
i
may
in
this
way.
we
have
presented
there
all
area
restrictions
which
are
researched
to
disclose
which
were
adopted
by
the
department
at
the
time
when
section
1185
or
one
of
its
identical
predecessors
was
in
effect.
and
none
of
those
instances
invokes
or
is
related
in
any
way
or
warns
about
the
sanctions
of
1185.
they
are
all
accounts
in
request
for
safe
passage
terms.
there
is
no
reference
to
or
warning
about
a
criminal
penalty.
and
this
if
the
court
please,
this
includes
three
such
instances
which
occurred
after
the
enactment
of
the
current
legislation.
and
i
would
draw
your
attention
particularly
--
although,
certainly
not
exclusively
to
the
1918
instance
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
because
the
government
pays
so
much
attention
to
what
it
was
doing
at
the
time
the
original
1918
statute
was
passed.
where
the
government
had
to
practice
at
that
time,
the
department
had
to
practice
at
that
time,
of
saying
where
--
to
what
areas
the
passport
was
good
for
but
they
--
and
one
of
the
areas
where
it
was
suppose
to
be
not
good
was
germany
at
that
time.
but
the
department's
explanatory
statement
said
that
this
doesn't
mean
that
the
traveler
couldn't
go
to
germany,
it
meant
that
he
had
to
go
there
on
his
own
responsibility
and
at
his
own
risk.
and
then
as
consistently
thereafter,
the
government
was
talking
not
in
terms
of
a
prohibition
enforced
by
criminal
sanction
but
in
terms
of
requesting
safe
passage.
now
two
instances,
both
of
them
after
the
current
statute
was
passed,
require
a
little
more
attention.
in
1952,
the
department
of
state
passed
a
so-called
ban
on
travel
to
communist
countries.
it
declared
that
these
passports
would
not
be
validated
for
a
certain
named
communist
countries.
in
its
explanatory
statement
at
that
time,
it
is
said
that
the
department
emphasizes,
this
is
its
own
words
that
this
action
in
no
way
forbid
that
also
as
it
claims,
travel
to
these
countries.
it
said
that
it
contemplated
that
the
traveler
would
inquire
of
the
government
what
conditions
were
in
the
countries
to
which
he
intended
to
go
and
if
the
normal
protective
or
satisfactory
protective
arrangements
existed
the
travel
would
be
authorized.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
is
in
effect
a
disclaimer
that
the
court
--
the
--
that
area
restrictions
were
being
issued
with
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
them.
and
indeed,
so
did
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
which
termed
it
an
honest
admission
that
the
department
lacked
criminal
powers
to
enforce
area
restrictions.
more
clear
and
more
explicit
by
way
of
disclaimer
of
criminal
sanction
is
the
1957
incident
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
the
able
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
directed
this
question
to
the
department.
what
does
it
mean?
he
said.
if
a
passport
is
stamped
not
valid
for
travel
to
country
x
and
the
holder
of
the
passport
goes
to
country
x.
is
he
violating
the
criminal
law?
and
the
department
asked
for
a
time
to
study
that
question
and
it
took
two
months
to
study
it
and
then
submitted
a
written
reply
in
which
it
said,
not
necessarily.
and
then
went
on
to
illustrate
its
meaning
by
saying
that
peripheral
to
the
travel
itself,
there
might
be
criminal
risks
for
the
traveler
because
if
he
went
to
such
a
country,
currency
exchanges
might
involve
even
trading
with
the
enemy
act
violation.
or
he
might
not
be
able
to
get
a
passport
in
the
future
or
he
might
be
involved
in
false
statement
accusations
growing
out
of
his
application
for
the
passport
that
he
was
using.
but
nowhere,
the
court
please,
nowhere
did
the
court
say
that
kind
of
travel
would
violate
section
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
excuse
me,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
chairman
at
that
point
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
exactly.
and
that's
what
i'm
offering
it
for
you,
your
honor.
and
i
claim
that
this
is
an
illustration
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
significance
of
area
restrictions
so
far
as
criminal
penalties
are
concern
and
that
the
secretary
was
in
effect
saying
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
if
you
go
where
the
passport
is
not
valid
for.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
seems
to
me
that
either
inference
is
possible
but
neither
inference
is
permissible.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
she
had
a
passport.
the
government
chose
to
prove
its
case
on
the
stipulation
which
is
in
the
record.
the
government
did
not
choose
to
advance
fact
dealing
with
whether
she
had
any
passport
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
no.
i
think
my
argument
is
not
different
because
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
government's
act
here,
the
excluding
cuba
regulations
(inaudible)
was
to
establish
this
prohibition
on
travel
based
upon
destination.
and
that
this
is
the
essence
--
the
gist
if
you
will
of
the
prosecution
and
she
can't
be
held
criminally
liable
for
that
because
i
think
that
the
statute
did
not
authorize
that.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
without
a
valid
passport.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
depends
on
the
kind
of
passport,
mr.
justice
white.
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no
passport
at
all.
well,
under
the
regulations
which
the
secretary
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
the
statute
alone?
if
the
statute
stood
alone
without
the
regulations
which
were
issued
under
the
1952
then
i
would
say
crossing
the
border
without
a
valid
passport
would
violate
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
regulation
issued
in
1952
said
that
if
the
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
a
passport
would
not
be
required.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
by
inference
it
left
the
requirement
for
a
passport
as
to
those
countries
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
you
would
be
violating
section
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
they
arrest
it,
if
you
please
on
the
precedent
regulations
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
in
1952,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
see
if
--
if
the
regulation
stood
along,
i
think
the
problem
as
to
cuba
would
be
the
same
as
the
problem
going
to
france.
the
regulation
doesn't
stand
alone.
it
stands
with
the
public
notice
and
with
the
press
release.
and
together,
this
imposed
and
they
say
so.
and
if
they
--
they
say
that
they
are
intended
to
impose
a
licensing
requirement
--
they
don't
use
that
term
but
they
say,
"you
go
to
cuba.
it
isn't
necessary
to
have
just
a
valid
passport
it
has
to
be
--
you
have
to
have
a
passport
that
says
you
can
go
to
cuba.
now,
i
say
that
because
of
that
to
which
is
in
the
case
and
inextricable
from
the
case,
you
can't
look
at
this
the
same
way
as
you
look
at
a
departure
for
travel.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
again
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
as
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
your
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
correct.
the
court
has
held
in
this
general
case
that
the
court
--
that
the
secretary
may
impose
the
area
of
restrictions
under
section
211
(a).
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
government
is
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no.
i
don't
think
it's
quite
clear
here
mr.
justice
white
i
think
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
regulation
required
travis
to
have
a
passport
specifically
validated
for
cuba
and
she
didn't
have
that
and
therefore
she
violated
section
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
you
see.
and
this
is
the
heart
of
the
government's
case
and
its
--
and
indeed
it's
the
heart
of
our
case.
i
say
for
example
that
--
that
if
one
wants
to
go
to
france,
he
goes
and
gets
a
passport
and
he
goes
to
france.
and
the
only
requirement
that
the
law
imposes
on
him
is
that
he
holds
that
passport
when
he
crosses
the
border.
and
this
is
simply
a
border
crossing
regulation
if
you
will.
but
when
the
government
says,
you
have
to
have
a
passport
especially
marked
for
cuba,
to
go
to
cuba
then
it
is
saying
more
than
simply
you
have
to
have
a
passport
in
your
hand
when
he
crossed
the
border.
you
have
to
ask
the
government's
license
to
go
to
cuba.
and
this
transforms
the
case
as
i
see
it
from
a
simple
border
control
regulation
to
a
system
whereby
the
government
is
saying
to
people,
you
can
go
to
this
place
but
not
to
this
place
unless
we
tell
you
specifically
you
can
go
to
this
place
where
licensing
travel
in
the
national
interest
as
they
put
it.
in
the
--
in
these
three
faceted
thing
that
they
did
on
january
16,
1961.
i
wonder
if
i
might
for
a
moment
address
myself
again
to
the
question
you
raised
mr.
justice
brennan
about
the
negative
pregnant
we're
not
dealing
with
the
pleading
here.
we're
dealing
with
proof
and
the
proof
in
the
case
is
only
what
the
record
shows
namely
that
she
did
not
have
a
passport
valid
--
validated
or
especially
endorsed
to
travel
to
cuba.
and
if
there
is
any
shortcoming
in
that
proof,
it
works
against
the
prosecutor,
i
submit,
not
against
the
accused.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
in
the
case
too
mr.
justice
clark
but
in
it
--
but
both
things
are
true.
the
evidence
--
the
stipulation
is
that
she
did
not
bear
a
valid
--
and
this
is
page
51
of
the
record,
paragraph
11,
she
did
not
bear
a
valid
united
states
passport
specifically
endorsed
with
travel
to
the
republic
of
cuba.
now,
what
she
did
and
that's
also
in
the
stipulation
on
page
50
is
that
she
went
from
los
angeles
to
mexico
city
on
a
mexican
tourist
card.
so
that
--
so
far
is
that
leg
of
her
trip
considered
alone
is
concerned
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
right,
she
needed
no
passport
and
it
was
legal.
it
was
a
legal
departure.
after
she
got
to
mexico
city,
she
obtained
the
permission
of
cuba
to
enter
cuba
and
then
went
to
mexico
city
--
to
havana.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference
and
that
the
record
shows
on
the
next
page,
she
didn't
have
a
passport
validated
for
travel
to
cuba.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
that
there
is
this
loophole
on
the
stipulation
mr.
justice
clark.
the
stipulation
does
not
say
one
way
or
the
other
that
she
had
or
did
not
have
a
valid
passport.
it
simply
says
that
she
didn't
have
a
valid
passport
specifically
endorsed
for
a
travel
to
cuba
which
is
what
the
department's
regulations
called
for
to
go
to
cuba.
in
other
words,
she
didn't
hold
this
special
license
which
the
government
has
said
in
1961,
it
was
going
to
require
people
going
to
cuba.
now
getting
back
to
the
course
of
administrative
construction
and
interpretation,
we
referred
our
brief
to
the
department's
requests
for
legislation
which
would
impose
the
very
sanctions
which
the
government
urges
here.
they
asked
for
an
amendment
of
the
law
which
would
provide
the
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
go
to
places
which
the
department
had
said
they
shouldn't
go
to.
there
is
also
in
the
administrative
interpretation
a
fact
found
by
district
judge
zavatt
in
the
laub
case
which
is
companion
to
this
one,
that
notwithstanding
six
--
approximately
600
known
violations
of
its
area
of
restrictions.
the
government
had
failed
to
prosecute
any
until
it
be
--
it
began
a
worthy
prosecution
which
did
not
get
to
this
court,
the
laub
prosecution
and
the
travis
prosecution.
we're
not
urging
this
as
the
court
please
as
a
discriminatory
enforcement
of
the
law
proposition
but
it's
an
indication
that
the
government
consistently
did
not
regard
the
going
of
places
for
which
passports
were
not
validated
as
crimes
under
section
1185.
and
this
is
a
part
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
last
one
that
i
can
specifically
denominate
as
an
administration
request
mr.
justice
harlan
was
in
1958.
now,
there
have
been
a
large
state
of
passport
bills
introduced
in
the
year
since
some
of
which
were
said
to
reflect
in
whole
or
in
part
administration
viewpoints
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
sort
those
all
out
on
this
narrow
point
but
i
do
point
to
the
1958
went
in
with
those
--
a
presidential
message
from
president
eisenhower
requesting
this
information.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
boudin
--
hands
me
a
copy
of
hr
14895
in
the
89th
congress
second
session,
introduced
may
5,
1966
when
mr.
hayes
which
he
advises
me
as
an
administration
bill.
that
is
a
legislation
requested
by
the
department
and
this
contains
provisions
dealing
with
the
specific
problem
of
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
go
to
countries
if
the
government
had
declared
out
of
bound.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
may
5,
1966.
now,
as
i
apprehend
the
government's
position
in
its
answer
to
our
position,
that
is
that
one
must
combine
section
1185
with
section
1101
(a)
30
which
contains
a
definition
of
passport
and
include
as
one
of
the
elements
of
the
definition
that
would
be
valid
for
entry
of
the
bearer
into
a
foreign
country.
and
the
government's
position
is
that
that
definition
imports
into
the
word
valid
and
it
is
used
in
1185,
validity
in
terms
of
being
addressed
to
the
countries
to
which
the
traveler
was
destined.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
the
definition
valid
for
entry
of
the
bearer
into
a
foreign
country
is
a
generic
definition
and
doesn't
refer
to
any
particular
country
and
not
to
the
country
that
the
traveler
intends
to
go
to.
this
is
simply
an
effort
to
define
in
general
term
a
passport.
but
more
important,
if
the
logic
of
the
government's
position
were
to
be
followed,
it
results
in
precisely
the
opposite
of
everything
it
has
done
in
over
40
years
of
administering
this
or
the
anti
cuban
statutes,
because
the
government
says,
"if
it
endorses
the
passport
not
valid
for
travel
to
country
x
departing
the
united
states
for
country
x
with
an
otherwise
operative
passport
is
a
crime
under
section
1185."
and
this,
the
government
says,
"only
because
its
policies
and
practices
from
1918
on
were
geographically
restricted,"if
i
may
use
its
term.
and
therefore
because
it
was
geographically
restricted,
congress
they
say
must
have
incorporated
this
standard
of
validity
into
the
statutes.
but
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
this
lies
in
the
face
of
over
40
years
of
administrative
interpretation
to
the
contrary
in
which
every
area
restriction
issued
while
this
legislation
was
on
the
statute
books
and
where
criminal
sanctions
were
available
as
not
been
--
as
not
invoked
to
criminal
sanctions,
had
not
referred
to
the
criminal
sanctions,
and
have
not
sought
reinforcement
from
the
criminal
sanctions.--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
its
--
the
first
statute
was
enacted
in
1918.
it
was
valid
or
in
if
--
it
was
operative
only
for
about
three
years
until
1921.
it
expired
within
the
world
war
ii.
then
it
was
in
--
substantially
almost
identical
or
reenacted
in
1941.
that
statute
was
continued
in
effect
by
a
series
of
joint
resolution
to
the
congress
until
the
1952
statute
was
passed.
so
when
i
say
40
years,
i
don't
mean
that
there
was
a
consistent
factor
all
those
40
years.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
over
a
40
year
span
of
time
while
intermittently
this
congress
--
this
statute
was
in
effect
in
about
20
years
in
there
when
it
was
not
in
effect
at
all
and
the
issue
of
course
wasn't
before
it.
but
in
that
40-year
period
beginning
in
1918,
when
there
was
this
statutory
language
on
the
books
all
area
restrictions
were
not
couched
in
criminal
terms
but
were
couched
in
safe
passage
terms.
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
there
have
been
instances
at
least
two
of
them
when
the
government
specifically
disclaims
that
its
geographic
restrictions
have
violated
section
1185.
therefore
we
say
that
if
one
is
to
infer
the
intent
of
congress
from
the
administrative
practices
that
co-existed
with
the
enactment
and
the
life
of
the
statute
one
must
conclude
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
1185
to
incorporate
prohibitions
on
travel
to
designated
area.
on
this
question
of
what
is
a
valid
passport,
if
the
court
please,
the
district
court
in
laub
and
i
think
largely,
if
not
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
a
the
department
of
state
handbook
which
my
brother
boudin
cites
in
his
brief
in
the
laub
case,
says
that
valid
means
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
state,
countersigned
by
the
traveler
and
unexpired.
now,
we
submit
that
this
history
based
to
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
the
history
of
administrative
interpretation,
permits
one
and
only
--
one
of
two
and
only
one
of
two
conclusions.
first,
that
if
conclusively
negatives
a
congressional
intent
to
include
in
section
1185
criminal
punishment
for
violation
of
area
restriction
and
this
i
think
is
a
soundly
supported
conclusion.
the
second
conclusion
is
that
this
history
read
in
the
light
of
obligatory
canons,
a
statutory
construction
leaves
substantial
doubt
as
to
the
congressional
purpose.
and
the
obligatory
canon,
we
submit
are
strict
construction,
strict
construction
not
simply
because
this
is
a
criminal
statute
but
certainly
because
it
is
a
criminal
statute.
but
also
strict
construction
because
it
impinges
upon
constitutionally
protected
liberty
and
on
liberties
closely
related
to
the
first
amendment
protection.
and
under
the
second
alternative,
if
there
is
as
we
say
there
is
substantial
and
abiding
doubt
of
the
congressional
purpose
then
there
is
no
clear
statutory
command
of
the
kind
which
the
government
asserts.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
due
process
vagueness.
i
think
that
our
argument
on
congressional
intent
shows
the
vagueness
and
ambiguity
concerning
the
very
existence
of
the
statutory
command
for
violation
of
which
petitioner
here
stands
convicted.
we
submit
that
the
understanding
of
the
common
world
to
paraphrase
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
mcboyle
case.
even
when
aided
by
a
reasonably
intelligent
lawyer
could
not
know
with
reasonable
certainly
that
the
conduct
here
punished
was
in
fact
forbidden.
again,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
by
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
the
1952
statement
of
the
department
that
it's
--
that
its
area
restrictions
on
travel
to
the
communist
countries
in
no
way
forbids
such
travel.
it
is
an
honest
admission
of
the
statutory
basis
for
criminal
prosecution
does
not
exist.
but
i
think
that
there
is
an
addition
to
the
vagueness
concerning
the
existence
of
the
statutory
command,
a
vagueness
which
appears
from
the
three
faceted
act
of
the
government
in
trying
to
license
travel
to
cuba
in
january
16,
1961.
i
referred
to
a
press
release
which
was
simultaneously
the
promulgation
of
a
regulations
and
the
public
notice.
it
speaks
in
safe
conduct
terms.
it
says
--
it
explains
its
action
as
the
result
of
the
government's
inability
to
extend
normal
protective
services
to
american
visiting
cuba.
there
is
no
reference
in
that
press
release
the
criminal
penalty
and
if
there
was
anywhere
that
the
government
trying
advice
its
people
as
to
whether
they
expect
them
to
do
when
refrain
from
doing.
there
was
the
place
to
warn
of
criminal
penalties
if
the
government
intended
that
they
apply.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor,
appendix
e.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
they
do
now.
the
government
advices
this
is
--
advices
us
in
its
brief.
our
information
is
that
prior
to
the
excluding
cuba
amendment
and
for
sometime
thereafter
it
did
not
--
the
passport
did
not
contain
such
a
warning.
now,
the
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
don't
know
when
--
i
don't
know
when
the
--
that
date
that
they
began
stamping
them
was
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
which
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
or
she
--
no,
your
honor.
she
could
have
had
a
renewed
passport
that
didn't
have
the
warning.
you
see
there
permit
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
she
could
have
none
at
all
if
she
could
have
had
a
renewed
passport.
now
the
second
aspect
of
this
act
of
january
16,
1961
was
the
public
notice.
this
is
somewhat
less
clear
about
speaking
and
request
to
say
passage
term
but
it
does
refer
to
the
secretary's
authority
and
it
recites
only
section
211
(a),
not
section
1185.
and
again,
nothing
is
said
concerning
criminal
penalty.
the
regulation
itself
recites
that
it
was
promulgated
under
section
211
(a)
that
of
course
is
the
civil
passport
power.
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
enforcing
section
211
(a)
a
regulation
issued
under.
there
is
no
warning
in
this
regulation
concerning
criminal
penalties.
there
is
an
obscure
and
delphic
reference
to
section
1185
not
in
the
body
of
the
regulation
but
in
parenthetical
material
following
which
i
see
and
there
are
number
of
citations
including
that
to
1185.
if
that
reference
stands
just
as
i
have
described
it,
no
explanatory
words,
nothing.
it's
ambiguity
is
heightened
by
the
facts
that
the
regulations
which
it
purport
to
amend
that
is
22
cfr
53.2
-
53.3
were
originally
promulgated
--
adopted
by
the
president
in
1952
after
1185
had
been
passed
when
in
proclamation
3004
which
is
in
our
appendix
e,
adopted
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
to
that
effect
which
had
pre-existed
the
1952
statute.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
on
the
promulgation
date,
january
16,
1961,
the
department
intended
the
criminal
consequences
for
violation
of
this
regulation
which
the
government
asserted
in
indicting
petitioner
two
and
a
half
years
later.
the
time
and
the
place
to
had
said
so
was
in
at
least
one
of
this
elaborate
array
of
press
release,
public
notice
and
regulation
which
attended
the
excluding
cuba
regulation.
and
this,
the
more
so
because
an
unbroken
line
of
administrative
interpretation
beginning
in
1918
had
never
invoked
such
sanctions,
even
though
the
statute
was
available
and
on
at
least
two
occasions,
the
government
had
explicitly
disclaimed
such
sanction.
in
these
lights,
elemental
standards
demanded
fair
warning
of
the
conduct
proscribed.
i
find
in
these
facts
a
striking
parallel
to
those
involved
in
the
bowie
case.
that
is,
if
will
you
recall
as
one
of
those
sit-in
cases
where
people
were
charged
with
having
violated
the
statute
which
made
it
a
crime
to
enter
private
property
after
warning
not
to
do
so.
they
had
entered
without
such
a
warning.
they
remained
and
were
asked
to
leave
and
they
were
prosecuted
for
violating
the
statute
because
they
failed
to
leave
after
being
requested
to
do
so.
i
find
the
striking
parallel
between
the
facts
of
this
case
and
those
in
the
krauss
brothers'
case
which
is
an
opa
regulation
case
in
which
the
government
sought
to
prosecute
a
wholesale
butcher
for
a
tying
agreement
when
he
requires
his
purchasers
to
buy
a
certain
meat
products
in
addition
to
those
they
contracted
for.
and
this
court
found
that
while
the
price
administrator
had
the
authority
to
prohibit
any
tying
agreement
it
was
not
clear
from
these
regulations
that
he
had
prohibited
a
tying
agreement
involving
commodities
having
valued
where
they
were
sold
for
value
or
for
resealing
price.
somewhat
apposite
here,
i
think
quite
apposite
here
is
the
mersky
case
also
cited
in
our
in
our
brief
where
an
importer
of
violins
in
germany
changed
the
country
of
origin
label
after
leaving
the
label
intact
to
satisfy
the
tariff
regulations
and
the
tariff
collection
requirement
and
they
changed
it
to
--
from
a
--
labeled
it
--
said
they
were
made
in
east
germany
to
a
label
that
made
in
germany
where
the
regulation
--
through
the
separate
regulation
dealing
with
consumer
protection
and
his
change
label
satisfied
the
consumer
protection
regulation
and
the
government
at
that
point
tried
to
invoke
the
tariff
regulation
against
this.
in
each
of
these
cases
as
in
here
--
as
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
fair
warning
of
the
conduct
proscribed.
now,
the
court
below
disposed
of
our
fair
notice
position
by
pointing
to
the
stipulation
of
facts
that
petitioner
knew
the
provisions
of
section
1185
and
knew
the
provisions
of
22
cfr
53.2
and
53.3.
our
answer
to
that
is
two
quotes.
first,
that
knowledge
of
these
provisions
is
not
tantamount
to
awareness
of
their
legal
effects
and
it
is
not
tantamount
to
an
ability
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
which
the
regulations
and
the
departmental
practices
are
created.
in
any
event,
and
this
gets
as
close
to
the
problems
of
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
were
asking
me
about
a
moment
ago.
knowledge
of
22
cfr
53.2
and
53.3
would
apprise
the
reader
only
that
from
january
16,
1961
on,
a
passport
was
required
for
travel
to
cuba,
a
passport
just
like
it
was
traveling
required
for
france
or
burma
or
wherever
you
want
to
go.
but
it
would
not
disclose
that
a
traveler
had
to
have
a
special
license
to
go
to
cuba
which
the
public
notice
and
the
press
release
told
about.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor.
but
not
in
the
regulation,
you
see.
and
that's
why
reading
cfr
doesn't
tell
the
petitioner
just
because
the
public
notice
and
the
press
release
don't
go
into
cfr.
the
public
notice
goes
into
the
federal
register
and
the
press
release
goes
to
the
newspaper.
and
the
traveler
trying
to
find
out
what
he
is
required
to
do
then
goes
from
the
statute
to
cfr,
perhaps
she
sees
the
federal
register
and
if
the
newspapers
in
his
town
carries
a
press
release,
he
might
see
that.
all
she
could
see
was
the
thing
that
you've
pointed
out
to
me
a
moment
ago
which
of
course
is
in
the
case
that
by
looking
at
the
regulation,
she
would
see
that
she
needed
a
passport,
a
passport
to
cuba
just
as
you
had
needed
the
passport
for
france.
and
as
i've
said
before
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
proves
that
she
violated
that
regulation
so
drawn
if
the
negative
pregnant
operate,
it
operates
against
the
government.
i
know
that
this
is
a
criminal
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
government
in
making
that
statement
sir,
goes
outside
the
record.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
suppose
it's
a
piece
of
paper
by
that
time.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
if
it's
validly
revoked,
i
suppose
it's
a
piece
of
paper.
if
it's
invalidly
revoked,
i
don't
--
it
becomes
--
perhaps
in
some
lingo.
i
believe
that
there
are
departmental
regulations
setting
up
administrative
procedures
to
the
revocation
of
the
passport.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
dealing
with
that.
now,
if
the
stipulation
with
the
petitioner
made
that
she
knew
the
provisions
of
1185
and
title
22
cfr
could
be
taken
as
something
giving
her
notice
that
she
should
look
further.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
appendix
b
contains
cfr
with
the
excluding
cuba
amendment
in
it
and
appendix
c
contains
cfr
prior
to
the
excluding
cuba
amendment.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
appendix
b
mr.
justice
white,
beginning
with
subparagraph
b
and
just
before
the
proviso.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
did
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
your
honor
it's
not
an
opaque
stipulation
--
to
answer
your
questions
beyond
that
i
have
to
go
beyond
the
record
myself.
i
negotiated
this
stipulation
with
the
deputy
united
states
attorney
and
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
i
said
to
him
and
what
he
said
to
me,
i'll
be
glad
be
to
do
so.
i
feel
that
it
takes
me
beyond
this
record.
if
the
stipulated
knowledge
be
construed
as
something
that
takes
the
petitioner
beyond
the
cfr
because
it's
some
kind
of
placing
her
on
inquiry
then
she
would
look
at
the
regulation
itself
and
see
that
it
was
an
action
taken
by
the
government
under
section
211
(a)
which
is
not
a
criminal
statute
but
a
civil
passport
statute
she
would
see
that
she
was
being
required
to
get
a
license
from
the
secretary
to
go
to
cuba
because
the
government
still
unable
to
extend
normal
protective
services
to
americans
traveling
in
cuba.
and
this
was
just
like
all
the
other
geographic
restrictions
and
all
of
them
had
been
non-criminal
in
nature.
and
she
would
look
in
vain
either
on
the
face
of
the
regulation
or
the
press
release
or
the
public
notice
for
any
warning
that
there
was
a
criminal
consequence
to
go
into
cuba
without
the
specially
endorsed
passport.
in
brief
then
the
knowledge
which
the
petitioner
stipulated
she
had
either
told
her
that
she
need
--
have
no
more
than
a
valid
unexpired
passport
and
this
knowledge
is
not
material
here
i
submit,
or
that
the
knowledge
would
lead
or
that
knowledge
which
she
stipulated
she
had
would
lead
to
her
being
misled
concerning
the
existence
of
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
area
restriction
mr.
justice
white
has
to
be
found
in
three
places.
first
is
appendix
b
which
excludes
the
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
next
is
appendix
d
and
the
next
appendix
e.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
d
and
e.
the
d
and
e
came
out
simultaneously.
the
important
part
of
d
if
i
may
suggest
is
the
third
paragraph.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
know
of
none.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
there
are
other
areas
of
restrictions,
north
korea,
north
vietnam,
albania
and
china.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
partly
that's
true,
what
they
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
practice
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
public
statement
requiring
special
validations
for
these
other
places.
but
if
it
were,
i
would
regard
it
as
in
the
same
category
as
this
one.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
--
you
mean
the
facts
of
area
of
restrictions.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i'm
not
contesting
the
fact
that
the
government
has
attempted
to
impose
area
of
restriction.
what
i'm
contesting
here
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
law
for
punishing
this
traveling
violation
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
there
had
been
of
course
and
there
were
in
the
public
prints
not
long
ago
considerable
information
concerning
people
that
went
to
some
of
these
other
areas
that
were
restricted.
i
believe
some
of
them
went
even
without
special
state
department
license.
now
our
third
point
if
the
court
please
is
that
as
invoked
here,
the
statute
involves
a
delegation
of
legislative
policy.
the
very
vagueness
of
the
statutory
command
and
the
long
history
of
administrative
interpretation
in
not
applying
criminal
sanction
as
the
area
of
restriction,
combined
to
show
that
a
policy
judgment
was
reached
by
the
secretary
and
not
by
the
congress.
and
that
policy
judgment
was
to
punish
a
crime
in
violation
of
area
of
restriction.
the
legislature
made
no
such
determination.
section
1185
has
no
standards
for
the
rule
making
authority.
the
requirement
for
--
of
a
valid
passport
for
crossing
the
united
states'
borders
was
made
subject
to
such
exceptions
and
limitations
that
the
president
may
provide
without
giving
any
guidance
as
to
what
the
president
may
or
may
not
do.
now,
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
the
government
concedes
that
the
statute
does
not
deal
with
the
prohibitions
of
--
with
prohibitions
of
travel
to
designated
areas
and
responses
of
the
legislation
did
not
articulate
to
show
awareness
of
any
such
prohibitions.
we
shown
administrative
practice
consistent
and
unbroken
of
not
enforcing
geographic
restrictions
by
criminal
penalties
and
therefore,
we
say
that
the
policy
decision
was
made
by
the
secretary
and
not
by
the
congress
without
authority
and
without
guidelines.
the
secretary
did
not
as
the
government
contends
still
in
the
detail.
he
made
a
very
determination
that
there
was
a
crime
here
in
violating
area
restriction.
we
are
aware
of
the
observations
of
the
court
in
the
zemel
case
to
the
effect
that
in
foreign
relations
matter,
the
standards
for
administrative
action
maybe
broader.
with
due
respect,
i
must
say
i
regard
those
formulations
as
unfortunate
particularly
as
they
apply
to
the
rights
and
the
obligations
of
citizens.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
when
you
say
that
sir,
you
mean
entering
with
no
passport
or
leaving
the
united
states?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
leaving?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no.
our
position
is
that
if
you
have
a
passport
which
is
operative
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
our
position
still
is
that
when
you
cross
the
border
and
that's
what
1185
deals
with,
crossing
border.
you
got
that
piece
of
paper
in
your
hand
as
operative
you
satisfy
1185.
now,
if
you
go
into
country
x
the
--
and
the
government
goes
after
you
for
traveling
two
way
planes
then
we
say
it's
going
outside
of
1185.
it's
got
into
the
area
that
it
asked
legislation
for
and
never
gotten.
now,
and
--
while
i'm
on
that
subject
may
i
say
this
that
there
was
an
unfortunate
formulation
in
our
brief.
it
was
referenced
to
the
request
for
legislation.
we
don't
urge
congressional
inaction
as
proof
of
the
legislative
intent
rather
we
urged
a
request
for
legislation
as
indicative
of
administrative
interpretation.
this
was
the
way
the
--
this
illustrates
the
way
that
the
secretary
read
his
powers
--
read
the
powers
of
government.
but
getting
back
to
zemel
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor
that
is
the
probing
question.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
i
understand
your
honor's
concern.
let
me
remind
that
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
question
properly
is
what
has
the
prosecutor
proved
in
this
case?
has
he
proved
that
she
did
not
have
a
valid
passport?
or
did
he
prove
that
she
did
not
have
a
valid
passport
specifically
endorsed
for
cuba?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
on
--
if
you
decide
that
the
government
didn't
prove
its
case
that
ends
the
government's
case.
let
me
just
try
to
finish
on
this
zemel
question.
i
think
that
we
deal
here
in
a
much
sharper
and
more
immediate
way
with
the
need
for
appropriate
standards
to
avoid
delegations
of
legislative
power
because
we
deal
with
the
criminal
statute
where
the
liberty
and
the
property
of
citizens
is
at
stake.
zemel
didn't
dispense
with
the
standards
altogether
and
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
every
reason
to
impose
the
approach
employed
in
kent
against
dulles
to
require
legislative
standards
that
passed
the
accepted
test.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
can
hear
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
do
not
think
so
on
that
point
sir,
no.
and
nor
do
i
think
that
the
other
cases
cited
in
kent
against
dulles
on
this
question
are
obsolete.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
how
old
are
they?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
22
cfr
sections
53.1
to
9
covers
three
or
four
pages.
the
excluding
cuba
amendment
is
only
a
page
or
two
or
less
than
two
pages.
that's
the
amendment
itself
and
there's
a
public
notice
in
the
press
release,
they'd
take
up
another
page
or
two.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
that's
very
brief
sir.
the
--
this
is
in
appendix
a
getting
beyond
the
proclamation
language
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
president
and
subject
to
such
limitations
and
exceptions
as
the
president
may
authorized
and
prescribed
that
it
should
unlawful
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
depart
from
or
enter
or
attempt
to
depart
from
or
enter
united
states
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
the
delegations.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it's
a
--
if
the
tail
is
definitely
wagged,
the
dog
here
is
a
--
if
i
have
any
time
left
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
save
it
please.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
travis
here
stands
convicted
on
two
counts,
the
violation
of
title
8,
u.s.
code
section
1185
for
having
deported,
the
united
states
for
cuba
on
two
occasions
in
1962
without
a
valid
a
passport.
the
proof
by
stipulation
was
that
on
neither
occasion,
the
petitioner
have
and
i
quote,
"a
valid
united
states
passport
specifically
endorsed
for
travel
to
cuba."
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
at
all
as
to
whether
petitioner
had
an
otherwise
operative
passport.
so
the
evidence
shows
that
she
went
to
cuba
to
observe
the
living
and
working
conditions
of
the
people
and
the
effectuation
and
implementation
of
government
programs
dealing
with
health,
public
health,
housing,
education,
agriculture
industry.
the
fact
are
then
in
the
record
that
she
did
so
observed
and
take
photographs,
represented
a
copies
of
which
in
the
record.
and
upon
her
return,
she
reported
upon
her
observations
by
way
of
circular
letters
to
people
in
this
country
and
by
illustrated
lectures.
and
i
assume
from
the
decisions
in
(inaudible)
that
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
statutory
editing
in
section
1185
and
i
will
not
go
into
that
detail
unless
i'm
asked
to
sufficing
to
say
that
1185
replaced
two
earlier
statutes
which
in
pertinent
respects
here
were
identical.
there
were
prior
to
the
1952
enactment
of
section
1185
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
which
were
adopted
by
the
president
after
the
1952
statute
passed
in
proclamation
number
3004
which
is
set
forth
on
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
appendix
f.
and
these
regulations
provided
that
passports
would
not
be
required
for
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere.
in
1961,
the
so-called
excluding
cuba
amendment
was
adopted,
and
this
as
we
see
it
is
a
three
faceted
government
act
which
involved
a
regulation,
a
public
notice
and
a
press
release.
the
regulation
is
set
forth
at
appendix
b
of
our
brief.
it
states
in
terms
that
it
is
promulgated
under
an
executive
order
which
in
turn
was
based
upon
22
u.s.c.211
(a)
is
the
statute
involved
in
the
zemel
case.
it
does
not
say
that
it
was
promulgated
under
section
1185.
and
the
effect
of
it
was
to
exclude
cuba
from
the
exemption
in
the
earlier
regulations
pertaining
to
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere.
so
that
by
the
face
of
the
regulation
alone,
taking
it
by
itself,
a
passport
was
required
in
the
case
of
a
departure
for
cuba
just
as
it
were
had
been
required
for
a
departure
for
france,
or
burma,
or
cuba
and
whatever.
there
was
nothing
in
the
regulation
on
itself
which
required
a
special
endorsement
to
the
passport
for
cuba.
simultaneously,
with
the
promulgation
of
the
amendment
was
the
issuance
of
the
public
notice
that
is
set
forth
in
appendix
d
to
our
brief,
which
declared
existing
passports
invalid
for
cuba
and
provided
for
the
future
that
passports
not
be
valid
for
travel
to
cuba
unless
especially
endorsed
for
such
travel.
the
third
process
of
the
government
act
at
this
time
was
the
simultaneous
press
relief,
which
explained
the
government's
action
is
the
result
of
the
government's
inability
and
i
quote,
"to
extend
a
normal
protective
servicing
to
americans
traveling
in
--
or
visiting
in
cuba."
it
advised
that
the
specially
required
endorsement
for
passports
to
cuba
would
be
granted
only
to
persons,
"whose
travel
maybe
regarded
as
in
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states."
we
take
the
position
in
this
litigation,
if
the
court
please
that
the
regulations,
the
public
notice
and
the
press
release
are
an
integrated
scheme
to
regulate
travel
by
--
to
cuba
by
way
of
license
to
be
issued
in
a
total
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
state.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
our
first
position
namely
that
the
statute
does
not
authorize
the
imposition
of
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
area
travel
ban.
on
its
face
of
the
statute
and
i
now
refer
to
section
1185,
imposes
a
requirement
that
citizens
hold
a
valid
passports
at
the
time
they
cross
u.s.
borders
and
that
is
as
far
as
the
statute
goes.
the
face
of
the
statute
contains
no
reference
to
the
destination
of
it's
--
of
the
traveler
and
imposes
no
requirement
and
no
sanctions
related
to
the
destination
of
the
traveler.
as
applied
here,
the
government
would
read
the
statute
as
permitting
the
use
of
a
passport
requirement
with
a
purpose
of
prohibiting
travel
to
areas
declared
out
of
bounds
by
the
government.
and
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
as
we
think
it
is
written,
simply
a
border
control
regulation
or
whether
is
it
be
construed
as
we
think
the
government
would
construe
it
as
a
travel
to
regulation,
which
imposes
prohibitions
and
licenses
and
dependent
upon
the
destination
of
the
traveler.
our
position
rests
on
three
grounds
if
the
court
please.
first
on
the
face
of
the
statute
which
is
i've
already
pointed
out,
speaks
only
to
holding
a
passport
when
the
border
is
crossed
and
without
any
reference
to
destination
at
all.
the
second
point
of
our
position
here
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
discloses
a
purpose
to
impose
surveillance
and
control
over
border
crossing
specifically
and
articulately
directed
to
security
consideration
such
as
spies,
saboteurs
and
fugitives
in
justice.
and
as
our
legislative
history
shows,
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation
as
one
of
it
--
the
other
three
stages
at
which
it
was
enacted
specifically
said
that
it
was
not
directed
and
i
quote
again,
"it's
the
legitimate
travel
of
united
states
citizen."
the
third
ground
of
our
position
here
is
that
the
history
of
area
restrictions
as
developed
by
administrative
interpretation
and
application
shows
that
these
restrictions
has
been
consistently
regarded
as
unrelated
to
the
command
of
section
1185
as
not
armed
if
you
will
by
the
sanctions
of
section
1185.
i
said
consistently,
consistently
that
is
until
after
and
i
repeat,
after
the
excluding
cuba
regulations
was
adopted.
now,
it
appears
in
the
government's
brief
that
it
concedes
our
position
concerning
the
face
of
the
statute
and
it
concedes
our
position
concerning
the
legislative
history
and
i
do
not
discuss
this
here
unless
the
court
have
direct
questions
to
me
about
that.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
it
fact
--
in
fact,
it
does
not
deny
the
facts
that
we
present
on
administrative
construction,
although,
it
would
draw
from
different
inferences
from
it.
concerning
administrative
construction,
i
think
it's
important
to
observe
the
dual
function
of
a
passport
is
delineated
by
this
court
in
kent
against
dulles.
there,
the
court
spoke
first
the
function
of
the
passport
as
a
request
directed
to
foreign
government
for
the
safe
passage
of
the
traveler
and
secondly,
as
a
means
of
exit
control.
we
think
that
the
history
of
area
restrictions
developed
by
the
administrative
action
of
the
department
of
state
has
always
and
explicitly
acted
with
reference
to
the
request
for
safe
passage
function
alone.
without
going
into
the
details
of
the
administrative
construction
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
let
me
summarize
it
briefly
if
i
may
in
this
way.
we
have
presented
there
all
area
restrictions
which
are
researched
to
disclose
which
were
adopted
by
the
department
at
the
time
when
section
1185
or
one
of
its
identical
predecessors
was
in
effect.
and
none
of
those
instances
invokes
or
is
related
in
any
way
or
warns
about
the
sanctions
of
1185.
they
are
all
accounts
in
request
for
safe
passage
terms.
there
is
no
reference
to
or
warning
about
a
criminal
penalty.
and
this
if
the
court
please,
this
includes
three
such
instances
which
occurred
after
the
enactment
of
the
current
legislation.
and
i
would
draw
your
attention
particularly
--
although,
certainly
not
exclusively
to
the
1918
instance
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
because
the
government
pays
so
much
attention
to
what
it
was
doing
at
the
time
the
original
1918
statute
was
passed.
where
the
government
had
to
practice
at
that
time,
the
department
had
to
practice
at
that
time,
of
saying
where
--
to
what
areas
the
passport
was
good
for
but
they
--
and
one
of
the
areas
where
it
was
suppose
to
be
not
good
was
germany
at
that
time.
but
the
department's
explanatory
statement
said
that
this
doesn't
mean
that
the
traveler
couldn't
go
to
germany,
it
meant
that
he
had
to
go
there
on
his
own
responsibility
and
at
his
own
risk.
and
then
as
consistently
thereafter,
the
government
was
talking
not
in
terms
of
a
prohibition
enforced
by
criminal
sanction
but
in
terms
of
requesting
safe
passage.
now
two
instances,
both
of
them
after
the
current
statute
was
passed,
require
a
little
more
attention.
in
1952,
the
department
of
state
passed
a
so-called
ban
on
travel
to
communist
countries.
it
declared
that
these
passports
would
not
be
validated
for
a
certain
named
communist
countries.
in
its
explanatory
statement
at
that
time,
it
is
said
that
the
department
emphasizes,
this
is
its
own
words
that
this
action
in
no
way
forbid
that
also
as
it
claims,
travel
to
these
countries.
it
said
that
it
contemplated
that
the
traveler
would
inquire
of
the
government
what
conditions
were
in
the
countries
to
which
he
intended
to
go
and
if
the
normal
protective
or
satisfactory
protective
arrangements
existed
the
travel
would
be
authorized.
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
is
in
effect
a
disclaimer
that
the
court
--
the
--
that
area
restrictions
were
being
issued
with
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
them.
and
indeed,
so
did
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
which
termed
it
an
honest
admission
that
the
department
lacked
criminal
powers
to
enforce
area
restrictions.
more
clear
and
more
explicit
by
way
of
disclaimer
of
criminal
sanction
is
the
1957
incident
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
the
able
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
directed
this
question
to
the
department.
what
does
it
mean?
he
said.
if
a
passport
is
stamped
not
valid
for
travel
to
country
x
and
the
holder
of
the
passport
goes
to
country
x.
is
he
violating
the
criminal
law?
and
the
department
asked
for
a
time
to
study
that
question
and
it
took
two
months
to
study
it
and
then
submitted
a
written
reply
in
which
it
said,
not
necessarily.
and
then
went
on
to
illustrate
its
meaning
by
saying
that
peripheral
to
the
travel
itself,
there
might
be
criminal
risks
for
the
traveler
because
if
he
went
to
such
a
country,
currency
exchanges
might
involve
even
trading
with
the
enemy
act
violation.
or
he
might
not
be
able
to
get
a
passport
in
the
future
or
he
might
be
involved
in
false
statement
accusations
growing
out
of
his
application
for
the
passport
that
he
was
using.
but
nowhere,
the
court
please,
nowhere
did
the
court
say
that
kind
of
travel
would
violate
section
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
excuse
me,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
chairman
at
that
point
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
exactly.
and
that's
what
i'm
offering
it
for
you,
your
honor.
and
i
claim
that
this
is
an
illustration
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
significance
of
area
restrictions
so
far
as
criminal
penalties
are
concern
and
that
the
secretary
was
in
effect
saying
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
if
you
go
where
the
passport
is
not
valid
for.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
seems
to
me
that
either
inference
is
possible
but
neither
inference
is
permissible.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
she
had
a
passport.
the
government
chose
to
prove
its
case
on
the
stipulation
which
is
in
the
record.
the
government
did
not
choose
to
advance
fact
dealing
with
whether
she
had
any
passport
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
no.
i
think
my
argument
is
not
different
because
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
government's
act
here,
the
excluding
cuba
regulations
(inaudible)
was
to
establish
this
prohibition
on
travel
based
upon
destination.
and
that
this
is
the
essence
--
the
gist
if
you
will
of
the
prosecution
and
she
can't
be
held
criminally
liable
for
that
because
i
think
that
the
statute
did
not
authorize
that.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
without
a
valid
passport.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
depends
on
the
kind
of
passport,
mr.
justice
white.
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no
passport
at
all.
well,
under
the
regulations
which
the
secretary
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
the
statute
alone?
if
the
statute
stood
alone
without
the
regulations
which
were
issued
under
the
1952
then
i
would
say
crossing
the
border
without
a
valid
passport
would
violate
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
regulation
issued
in
1952
said
that
if
the
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
a
passport
would
not
be
required.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
by
inference
it
left
the
requirement
for
a
passport
as
to
those
countries
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
you
would
be
violating
section
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
they
arrest
it,
if
you
please
on
the
precedent
regulations
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
in
1952,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
see
if
--
if
the
regulation
stood
along,
i
think
the
problem
as
to
cuba
would
be
the
same
as
the
problem
going
to
france.
the
regulation
doesn't
stand
alone.
it
stands
with
the
public
notice
and
with
the
press
release.
and
together,
this
imposed
and
they
say
so.
and
if
they
--
they
say
that
they
are
intended
to
impose
a
licensing
requirement
--
they
don't
use
that
term
but
they
say,
"you
go
to
cuba.
it
isn't
necessary
to
have
just
a
valid
passport
it
has
to
be
--
you
have
to
have
a
passport
that
says
you
can
go
to
cuba.
now,
i
say
that
because
of
that
to
which
is
in
the
case
and
inextricable
from
the
case,
you
can't
look
at
this
the
same
way
as
you
look
at
a
departure
for
travel.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
again
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
as
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
your
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
correct.
the
court
has
held
in
this
general
case
that
the
court
--
that
the
secretary
may
impose
the
area
of
restrictions
under
section
211
(a).
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
government
is
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no.
i
don't
think
it's
quite
clear
here
mr.
justice
white
i
think
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
regulation
required
travis
to
have
a
passport
specifically
validated
for
cuba
and
she
didn't
have
that
and
therefore
she
violated
section
1185.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
you
see.
and
this
is
the
heart
of
the
government's
case
and
its
--
and
indeed
it's
the
heart
of
our
case.
i
say
for
example
that
--
that
if
one
wants
to
go
to
france,
he
goes
and
gets
a
passport
and
he
goes
to
france.
and
the
only
requirement
that
the
law
imposes
on
him
is
that
he
holds
that
passport
when
he
crosses
the
border.
and
this
is
simply
a
border
crossing
regulation
if
you
will.
but
when
the
government
says,
you
have
to
have
a
passport
especially
marked
for
cuba,
to
go
to
cuba
then
it
is
saying
more
than
simply
you
have
to
have
a
passport
in
your
hand
when
he
crossed
the
border.
you
have
to
ask
the
government's
license
to
go
to
cuba.
and
this
transforms
the
case
as
i
see
it
from
a
simple
border
control
regulation
to
a
system
whereby
the
government
is
saying
to
people,
you
can
go
to
this
place
but
not
to
this
place
unless
we
tell
you
specifically
you
can
go
to
this
place
where
licensing
travel
in
the
national
interest
as
they
put
it.
in
the
--
in
these
three
faceted
thing
that
they
did
on
january
16,
1961.
i
wonder
if
i
might
for
a
moment
address
myself
again
to
the
question
you
raised
mr.
justice
brennan
about
the
negative
pregnant
we're
not
dealing
with
the
pleading
here.
we're
dealing
with
proof
and
the
proof
in
the
case
is
only
what
the
record
shows
namely
that
she
did
not
have
a
passport
valid
--
validated
or
especially
endorsed
to
travel
to
cuba.
and
if
there
is
any
shortcoming
in
that
proof,
it
works
against
the
prosecutor,
i
submit,
not
against
the
accused.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
in
the
case
too
mr.
justice
clark
but
in
it
--
but
both
things
are
true.
the
evidence
--
the
stipulation
is
that
she
did
not
bear
a
valid
--
and
this
is
page
51
of
the
record,
paragraph
11,
she
did
not
bear
a
valid
united
states
passport
specifically
endorsed
with
travel
to
the
republic
of
cuba.
now,
what
she
did
and
that's
also
in
the
stipulation
on
page
50
is
that
she
went
from
los
angeles
to
mexico
city
on
a
mexican
tourist
card.
so
that
--
so
far
is
that
leg
of
her
trip
considered
alone
is
concerned
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
right,
she
needed
no
passport
and
it
was
legal.
it
was
a
legal
departure.
after
she
got
to
mexico
city,
she
obtained
the
permission
of
cuba
to
enter
cuba
and
then
went
to
mexico
city
--
to
havana.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference
and
that
the
record
shows
on
the
next
page,
she
didn't
have
a
passport
validated
for
travel
to
cuba.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
that
there
is
this
loophole
on
the
stipulation
mr.
justice
clark.
the
stipulation
does
not
say
one
way
or
the
other
that
she
had
or
did
not
have
a
valid
passport.
it
simply
says
that
she
didn't
have
a
valid
passport
specifically
endorsed
for
a
travel
to
cuba
which
is
what
the
department's
regulations
called
for
to
go
to
cuba.
in
other
words,
she
didn't
hold
this
special
license
which
the
government
has
said
in
1961,
it
was
going
to
require
people
going
to
cuba.
now
getting
back
to
the
course
of
administrative
construction
and
interpretation,
we
referred
our
brief
to
the
department's
requests
for
legislation
which
would
impose
the
very
sanctions
which
the
government
urges
here.
they
asked
for
an
amendment
of
the
law
which
would
provide
the
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
go
to
places
which
the
department
had
said
they
shouldn't
go
to.
there
is
also
in
the
administrative
interpretation
a
fact
found
by
district
judge
zavatt
in
the
laub
case
which
is
companion
to
this
one,
that
notwithstanding
six
--
approximately
600
known
violations
of
its
area
of
restrictions.
the
government
had
failed
to
prosecute
any
until
it
be
--
it
began
a
worthy
prosecution
which
did
not
get
to
this
court,
the
laub
prosecution
and
the
travis
prosecution.
we're
not
urging
this
as
the
court
please
as
a
discriminatory
enforcement
of
the
law
proposition
but
it's
an
indication
that
the
government
consistently
did
not
regard
the
going
of
places
for
which
passports
were
not
validated
as
crimes
under
section
1185.
and
this
is
a
part
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
last
one
that
i
can
specifically
denominate
as
an
administration
request
mr.
justice
harlan
was
in
1958.
now,
there
have
been
a
large
state
of
passport
bills
introduced
in
the
year
since
some
of
which
were
said
to
reflect
in
whole
or
in
part
administration
viewpoints
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
sort
those
all
out
on
this
narrow
point
but
i
do
point
to
the
1958
went
in
with
those
--
a
presidential
message
from
president
eisenhower
requesting
this
information.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
boudin
--
hands
me
a
copy
of
hr
14895
in
the
89th
congress
second
session,
introduced
may
5,
1966
when
mr.
hayes
which
he
advises
me
as
an
administration
bill.
that
is
a
legislation
requested
by
the
department
and
this
contains
provisions
dealing
with
the
specific
problem
of
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
go
to
countries
if
the
government
had
declared
out
of
bound.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
may
5,
1966.
now,
as
i
apprehend
the
government's
position
in
its
answer
to
our
position,
that
is
that
one
must
combine
section
1185
with
section
1101
(a)
30
which
contains
a
definition
of
passport
and
include
as
one
of
the
elements
of
the
definition
that
would
be
valid
for
entry
of
the
bearer
into
a
foreign
country.
and
the
government's
position
is
that
that
definition
imports
into
the
word
valid
and
it
is
used
in
1185,
validity
in
terms
of
being
addressed
to
the
countries
to
which
the
traveler
was
destined.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
the
definition
valid
for
entry
of
the
bearer
into
a
foreign
country
is
a
generic
definition
and
doesn't
refer
to
any
particular
country
and
not
to
the
country
that
the
traveler
intends
to
go
to.
this
is
simply
an
effort
to
define
in
general
term
a
passport.
but
more
important,
if
the
logic
of
the
government's
position
were
to
be
followed,
it
results
in
precisely
the
opposite
of
everything
it
has
done
in
over
40
years
of
administering
this
or
the
anti
cuban
statutes,
because
the
government
says,
"if
it
endorses
the
passport
not
valid
for
travel
to
country
x
departing
the
united
states
for
country
x
with
an
otherwise
operative
passport
is
a
crime
under
section
1185."
and
this,
the
government
says,
"only
because
its
policies
and
practices
from
1918
on
were
geographically
restricted,"if
i
may
use
its
term.
and
therefore
because
it
was
geographically
restricted,
congress
they
say
must
have
incorporated
this
standard
of
validity
into
the
statutes.
but
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
this
lies
in
the
face
of
over
40
years
of
administrative
interpretation
to
the
contrary
in
which
every
area
restriction
issued
while
this
legislation
was
on
the
statute
books
and
where
criminal
sanctions
were
available
as
not
been
--
as
not
invoked
to
criminal
sanctions,
had
not
referred
to
the
criminal
sanctions,
and
have
not
sought
reinforcement
from
the
criminal
sanctions.--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
its
--
the
first
statute
was
enacted
in
1918.
it
was
valid
or
in
if
--
it
was
operative
only
for
about
three
years
until
1921.
it
expired
within
the
world
war
ii.
then
it
was
in
--
substantially
almost
identical
or
reenacted
in
1941.
that
statute
was
continued
in
effect
by
a
series
of
joint
resolution
to
the
congress
until
the
1952
statute
was
passed.
so
when
i
say
40
years,
i
don't
mean
that
there
was
a
consistent
factor
all
those
40
years.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
over
a
40
year
span
of
time
while
intermittently
this
congress
--
this
statute
was
in
effect
in
about
20
years
in
there
when
it
was
not
in
effect
at
all
and
the
issue
of
course
wasn't
before
it.
but
in
that
40-year
period
beginning
in
1918,
when
there
was
this
statutory
language
on
the
books
all
area
restrictions
were
not
couched
in
criminal
terms
but
were
couched
in
safe
passage
terms.
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
there
have
been
instances
at
least
two
of
them
when
the
government
specifically
disclaims
that
its
geographic
restrictions
have
violated
section
1185.
therefore
we
say
that
if
one
is
to
infer
the
intent
of
congress
from
the
administrative
practices
that
co-existed
with
the
enactment
and
the
life
of
the
statute
one
must
conclude
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
1185
to
incorporate
prohibitions
on
travel
to
designated
area.
on
this
question
of
what
is
a
valid
passport,
if
the
court
please,
the
district
court
in
laub
and
i
think
largely,
if
not
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
a
the
department
of
state
handbook
which
my
brother
boudin
cites
in
his
brief
in
the
laub
case,
says
that
valid
means
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
state,
countersigned
by
the
traveler
and
unexpired.
now,
we
submit
that
this
history
based
to
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
the
history
of
administrative
interpretation,
permits
one
and
only
--
one
of
two
and
only
one
of
two
conclusions.
first,
that
if
conclusively
negatives
a
congressional
intent
to
include
in
section
1185
criminal
punishment
for
violation
of
area
restriction
and
this
i
think
is
a
soundly
supported
conclusion.
the
second
conclusion
is
that
this
history
read
in
the
light
of
obligatory
canons,
a
statutory
construction
leaves
substantial
doubt
as
to
the
congressional
purpose.
and
the
obligatory
canon,
we
submit
are
strict
construction,
strict
construction
not
simply
because
this
is
a
criminal
statute
but
certainly
because
it
is
a
criminal
statute.
but
also
strict
construction
because
it
impinges
upon
constitutionally
protected
liberty
and
on
liberties
closely
related
to
the
first
amendment
protection.
and
under
the
second
alternative,
if
there
is
as
we
say
there
is
substantial
and
abiding
doubt
of
the
congressional
purpose
then
there
is
no
clear
statutory
command
of
the
kind
which
the
government
asserts.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
due
process
vagueness.
i
think
that
our
argument
on
congressional
intent
shows
the
vagueness
and
ambiguity
concerning
the
very
existence
of
the
statutory
command
for
violation
of
which
petitioner
here
stands
convicted.
we
submit
that
the
understanding
of
the
common
world
to
paraphrase
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
mcboyle
case.
even
when
aided
by
a
reasonably
intelligent
lawyer
could
not
know
with
reasonable
certainly
that
the
conduct
here
punished
was
in
fact
forbidden.
again,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
by
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
the
1952
statement
of
the
department
that
it's
--
that
its
area
restrictions
on
travel
to
the
communist
countries
in
no
way
forbids
such
travel.
it
is
an
honest
admission
of
the
statutory
basis
for
criminal
prosecution
does
not
exist.
but
i
think
that
there
is
an
addition
to
the
vagueness
concerning
the
existence
of
the
statutory
command,
a
vagueness
which
appears
from
the
three
faceted
act
of
the
government
in
trying
to
license
travel
to
cuba
in
january
16,
1961.
i
referred
to
a
press
release
which
was
simultaneously
the
promulgation
of
a
regulations
and
the
public
notice.
it
speaks
in
safe
conduct
terms.
it
says
--
it
explains
its
action
as
the
result
of
the
government's
inability
to
extend
normal
protective
services
to
american
visiting
cuba.
there
is
no
reference
in
that
press
release
the
criminal
penalty
and
if
there
was
anywhere
that
the
government
trying
advice
its
people
as
to
whether
they
expect
them
to
do
when
refrain
from
doing.
there
was
the
place
to
warn
of
criminal
penalties
if
the
government
intended
that
they
apply.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor,
appendix
e.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
they
do
now.
the
government
advices
this
is
--
advices
us
in
its
brief.
our
information
is
that
prior
to
the
excluding
cuba
amendment
and
for
sometime
thereafter
it
did
not
--
the
passport
did
not
contain
such
a
warning.
now,
the
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
don't
know
when
--
i
don't
know
when
the
--
that
date
that
they
began
stamping
them
was
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
which
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
or
she
--
no,
your
honor.
she
could
have
had
a
renewed
passport
that
didn't
have
the
warning.
you
see
there
permit
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
she
could
have
none
at
all
if
she
could
have
had
a
renewed
passport.
now
the
second
aspect
of
this
act
of
january
16,
1961
was
the
public
notice.
this
is
somewhat
less
clear
about
speaking
and
request
to
say
passage
term
but
it
does
refer
to
the
secretary's
authority
and
it
recites
only
section
211
(a),
not
section
1185.
and
again,
nothing
is
said
concerning
criminal
penalty.
the
regulation
itself
recites
that
it
was
promulgated
under
section
211
(a)
that
of
course
is
the
civil
passport
power.
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
enforcing
section
211
(a)
a
regulation
issued
under.
there
is
no
warning
in
this
regulation
concerning
criminal
penalties.
there
is
an
obscure
and
delphic
reference
to
section
1185
not
in
the
body
of
the
regulation
but
in
parenthetical
material
following
which
i
see
and
there
are
number
of
citations
including
that
to
1185.
if
that
reference
stands
just
as
i
have
described
it,
no
explanatory
words,
nothing.
it's
ambiguity
is
heightened
by
the
facts
that
the
regulations
which
it
purport
to
amend
that
is
22
cfr
53.2
-
53.3
were
originally
promulgated
--
adopted
by
the
president
in
1952
after
1185
had
been
passed
when
in
proclamation
3004
which
is
in
our
appendix
e,
adopted
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
to
that
effect
which
had
pre-existed
the
1952
statute.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
on
the
promulgation
date,
january
16,
1961,
the
department
intended
the
criminal
consequences
for
violation
of
this
regulation
which
the
government
asserted
in
indicting
petitioner
two
and
a
half
years
later.
the
time
and
the
place
to
had
said
so
was
in
at
least
one
of
this
elaborate
array
of
press
release,
public
notice
and
regulation
which
attended
the
excluding
cuba
regulation.
and
this,
the
more
so
because
an
unbroken
line
of
administrative
interpretation
beginning
in
1918
had
never
invoked
such
sanctions,
even
though
the
statute
was
available
and
on
at
least
two
occasions,
the
government
had
explicitly
disclaimed
such
sanction.
in
these
lights,
elemental
standards
demanded
fair
warning
of
the
conduct
proscribed.
i
find
in
these
facts
a
striking
parallel
to
those
involved
in
the
bowie
case.
that
is,
if
will
you
recall
as
one
of
those
sit-in
cases
where
people
were
charged
with
having
violated
the
statute
which
made
it
a
crime
to
enter
private
property
after
warning
not
to
do
so.
they
had
entered
without
such
a
warning.
they
remained
and
were
asked
to
leave
and
they
were
prosecuted
for
violating
the
statute
because
they
failed
to
leave
after
being
requested
to
do
so.
i
find
the
striking
parallel
between
the
facts
of
this
case
and
those
in
the
krauss
brothers'
case
which
is
an
opa
regulation
case
in
which
the
government
sought
to
prosecute
a
wholesale
butcher
for
a
tying
agreement
when
he
requires
his
purchasers
to
buy
a
certain
meat
products
in
addition
to
those
they
contracted
for.
and
this
court
found
that
while
the
price
administrator
had
the
authority
to
prohibit
any
tying
agreement
it
was
not
clear
from
these
regulations
that
he
had
prohibited
a
tying
agreement
involving
commodities
having
valued
where
they
were
sold
for
value
or
for
resealing
price.
somewhat
apposite
here,
i
think
quite
apposite
here
is
the
mersky
case
also
cited
in
our
in
our
brief
where
an
importer
of
violins
in
germany
changed
the
country
of
origin
label
after
leaving
the
label
intact
to
satisfy
the
tariff
regulations
and
the
tariff
collection
requirement
and
they
changed
it
to
--
from
a
--
labeled
it
--
said
they
were
made
in
east
germany
to
a
label
that
made
in
germany
where
the
regulation
--
through
the
separate
regulation
dealing
with
consumer
protection
and
his
change
label
satisfied
the
consumer
protection
regulation
and
the
government
at
that
point
tried
to
invoke
the
tariff
regulation
against
this.
in
each
of
these
cases
as
in
here
--
as
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
fair
warning
of
the
conduct
proscribed.
now,
the
court
below
disposed
of
our
fair
notice
position
by
pointing
to
the
stipulation
of
facts
that
petitioner
knew
the
provisions
of
section
1185
and
knew
the
provisions
of
22
cfr
53.2
and
53.3.
our
answer
to
that
is
two
quotes.
first,
that
knowledge
of
these
provisions
is
not
tantamount
to
awareness
of
their
legal
effects
and
it
is
not
tantamount
to
an
ability
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
which
the
regulations
and
the
departmental
practices
are
created.
in
any
event,
and
this
gets
as
close
to
the
problems
of
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
were
asking
me
about
a
moment
ago.
knowledge
of
22
cfr
53.2
and
53.3
would
apprise
the
reader
only
that
from
january
16,
1961
on,
a
passport
was
required
for
travel
to
cuba,
a
passport
just
like
it
was
traveling
required
for
france
or
burma
or
wherever
you
want
to
go.
but
it
would
not
disclose
that
a
traveler
had
to
have
a
special
license
to
go
to
cuba
which
the
public
notice
and
the
press
release
told
about.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
your
honor.
but
not
in
the
regulation,
you
see.
and
that's
why
reading
cfr
doesn't
tell
the
petitioner
just
because
the
public
notice
and
the
press
release
don't
go
into
cfr.
the
public
notice
goes
into
the
federal
register
and
the
press
release
goes
to
the
newspaper.
and
the
traveler
trying
to
find
out
what
he
is
required
to
do
then
goes
from
the
statute
to
cfr,
perhaps
she
sees
the
federal
register
and
if
the
newspapers
in
his
town
carries
a
press
release,
he
might
see
that.
all
she
could
see
was
the
thing
that
you've
pointed
out
to
me
a
moment
ago
which
of
course
is
in
the
case
that
by
looking
at
the
regulation,
she
would
see
that
she
needed
a
passport,
a
passport
to
cuba
just
as
you
had
needed
the
passport
for
france.
and
as
i've
said
before
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
proves
that
she
violated
that
regulation
so
drawn
if
the
negative
pregnant
operate,
it
operates
against
the
government.
i
know
that
this
is
a
criminal
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
government
in
making
that
statement
sir,
goes
outside
the
record.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
suppose
it's
a
piece
of
paper
by
that
time.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
if
it's
validly
revoked,
i
suppose
it's
a
piece
of
paper.
if
it's
invalidly
revoked,
i
don't
--
it
becomes
--
perhaps
in
some
lingo.
i
believe
that
there
are
departmental
regulations
setting
up
administrative
procedures
to
the
revocation
of
the
passport.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
dealing
with
that.
now,
if
the
stipulation
with
the
petitioner
made
that
she
knew
the
provisions
of
1185
and
title
22
cfr
could
be
taken
as
something
giving
her
notice
that
she
should
look
further.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
appendix
b
contains
cfr
with
the
excluding
cuba
amendment
in
it
and
appendix
c
contains
cfr
prior
to
the
excluding
cuba
amendment.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
appendix
b
mr.
justice
white,
beginning
with
subparagraph
b
and
just
before
the
proviso.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
did
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
your
honor
it's
not
an
opaque
stipulation
--
to
answer
your
questions
beyond
that
i
have
to
go
beyond
the
record
myself.
i
negotiated
this
stipulation
with
the
deputy
united
states
attorney
and
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
i
said
to
him
and
what
he
said
to
me,
i'll
be
glad
be
to
do
so.
i
feel
that
it
takes
me
beyond
this
record.
if
the
stipulated
knowledge
be
construed
as
something
that
takes
the
petitioner
beyond
the
cfr
because
it's
some
kind
of
placing
her
on
inquiry
then
she
would
look
at
the
regulation
itself
and
see
that
it
was
an
action
taken
by
the
government
under
section
211
(a)
which
is
not
a
criminal
statute
but
a
civil
passport
statute
she
would
see
that
she
was
being
required
to
get
a
license
from
the
secretary
to
go
to
cuba
because
the
government
still
unable
to
extend
normal
protective
services
to
americans
traveling
in
cuba.
and
this
was
just
like
all
the
other
geographic
restrictions
and
all
of
them
had
been
non-criminal
in
nature.
and
she
would
look
in
vain
either
on
the
face
of
the
regulation
or
the
press
release
or
the
public
notice
for
any
warning
that
there
was
a
criminal
consequence
to
go
into
cuba
without
the
specially
endorsed
passport.
in
brief
then
the
knowledge
which
the
petitioner
stipulated
she
had
either
told
her
that
she
need
--
have
no
more
than
a
valid
unexpired
passport
and
this
knowledge
is
not
material
here
i
submit,
or
that
the
knowledge
would
lead
or
that
knowledge
which
she
stipulated
she
had
would
lead
to
her
being
misled
concerning
the
existence
of
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
area
restriction
mr.
justice
white
has
to
be
found
in
three
places.
first
is
appendix
b
which
excludes
the
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
next
is
appendix
d
and
the
next
appendix
e.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
d
and
e.
the
d
and
e
came
out
simultaneously.
the
important
part
of
d
if
i
may
suggest
is
the
third
paragraph.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
know
of
none.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
there
are
other
areas
of
restrictions,
north
korea,
north
vietnam,
albania
and
china.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
partly
that's
true,
what
they
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
practice
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
public
statement
requiring
special
validations
for
these
other
places.
but
if
it
were,
i
would
regard
it
as
in
the
same
category
as
this
one.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
--
you
mean
the
facts
of
area
of
restrictions.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i'm
not
contesting
the
fact
that
the
government
has
attempted
to
impose
area
of
restriction.
what
i'm
contesting
here
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
law
for
punishing
this
traveling
violation
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
there
had
been
of
course
and
there
were
in
the
public
prints
not
long
ago
considerable
information
concerning
people
that
went
to
some
of
these
other
areas
that
were
restricted.
i
believe
some
of
them
went
even
without
special
state
department
license.
now
our
third
point
if
the
court
please
is
that
as
invoked
here,
the
statute
involves
a
delegation
of
legislative
policy.
the
very
vagueness
of
the
statutory
command
and
the
long
history
of
administrative
interpretation
in
not
applying
criminal
sanction
as
the
area
of
restriction,
combined
to
show
that
a
policy
judgment
was
reached
by
the
secretary
and
not
by
the
congress.
and
that
policy
judgment
was
to
punish
a
crime
in
violation
of
area
of
restriction.
the
legislature
made
no
such
determination.
section
1185
has
no
standards
for
the
rule
making
authority.
the
requirement
for
--
of
a
valid
passport
for
crossing
the
united
states'
borders
was
made
subject
to
such
exceptions
and
limitations
that
the
president
may
provide
without
giving
any
guidance
as
to
what
the
president
may
or
may
not
do.
now,
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
the
government
concedes
that
the
statute
does
not
deal
with
the
prohibitions
of
--
with
prohibitions
of
travel
to
designated
areas
and
responses
of
the
legislation
did
not
articulate
to
show
awareness
of
any
such
prohibitions.
we
shown
administrative
practice
consistent
and
unbroken
of
not
enforcing
geographic
restrictions
by
criminal
penalties
and
therefore,
we
say
that
the
policy
decision
was
made
by
the
secretary
and
not
by
the
congress
without
authority
and
without
guidelines.
the
secretary
did
not
as
the
government
contends
still
in
the
detail.
he
made
a
very
determination
that
there
was
a
crime
here
in
violating
area
restriction.
we
are
aware
of
the
observations
of
the
court
in
the
zemel
case
to
the
effect
that
in
foreign
relations
matter,
the
standards
for
administrative
action
maybe
broader.
with
due
respect,
i
must
say
i
regard
those
formulations
as
unfortunate
particularly
as
they
apply
to
the
rights
and
the
obligations
of
citizens.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
when
you
say
that
sir,
you
mean
entering
with
no
passport
or
leaving
the
united
states?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
leaving?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no.
our
position
is
that
if
you
have
a
passport
which
is
operative
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
our
position
still
is
that
when
you
cross
the
border
and
that's
what
1185
deals
with,
crossing
border.
you
got
that
piece
of
paper
in
your
hand
as
operative
you
satisfy
1185.
now,
if
you
go
into
country
x
the
--
and
the
government
goes
after
you
for
traveling
two
way
planes
then
we
say
it's
going
outside
of
1185.
it's
got
into
the
area
that
it
asked
legislation
for
and
never
gotten.
now,
and
--
while
i'm
on
that
subject
may
i
say
this
that
there
was
an
unfortunate
formulation
in
our
brief.
it
was
referenced
to
the
request
for
legislation.
we
don't
urge
congressional
inaction
as
proof
of
the
legislative
intent
rather
we
urged
a
request
for
legislation
as
indicative
of
administrative
interpretation.
this
was
the
way
the
--
this
illustrates
the
way
that
the
secretary
read
his
powers
--
read
the
powers
of
government.
but
getting
back
to
zemel
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor
that
is
the
probing
question.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
i
understand
your
honor's
concern.
let
me
remind
that
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
question
properly
is
what
has
the
prosecutor
proved
in
this
case?
has
he
proved
that
she
did
not
have
a
valid
passport?
or
did
he
prove
that
she
did
not
have
a
valid
passport
specifically
endorsed
for
cuba?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
on
--
if
you
decide
that
the
government
didn't
prove
its
case
that
ends
the
government's
case.
let
me
just
try
to
finish
on
this
zemel
question.
i
think
that
we
deal
here
in
a
much
sharper
and
more
immediate
way
with
the
need
for
appropriate
standards
to
avoid
delegations
of
legislative
power
because
we
deal
with
the
criminal
statute
where
the
liberty
and
the
property
of
citizens
is
at
stake.
zemel
didn't
dispense
with
the
standards
altogether
and
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
every
reason
to
impose
the
approach
employed
in
kent
against
dulles
to
require
legislative
standards
that
passed
the
accepted
test.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
can
hear
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
do
not
think
so
on
that
point
sir,
no.
and
nor
do
i
think
that
the
other
cases
cited
in
kent
against
dulles
on
this
question
are
obsolete.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
how
old
are
they?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
22
cfr
sections
53.1
to
9
covers
three
or
four
pages.
the
excluding
cuba
amendment
is
only
a
page
or
two
or
less
than
two
pages.
that's
the
amendment
itself
and
there's
a
public
notice
in
the
press
release,
they'd
take
up
another
page
or
two.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
that's
very
brief
sir.
the
--
this
is
in
appendix
a
getting
beyond
the
proclamation
language
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
president
and
subject
to
such
limitations
and
exceptions
as
the
president
may
authorized
and
prescribed
that
it
should
unlawful
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
depart
from
or
enter
or
attempt
to
depart
from
or
enter
united
states
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
the
delegations.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it's
a
--
if
the
tail
is
definitely
wagged,
the
dog
here
is
a
--
if
i
have
any
time
left
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
save
it
please.
