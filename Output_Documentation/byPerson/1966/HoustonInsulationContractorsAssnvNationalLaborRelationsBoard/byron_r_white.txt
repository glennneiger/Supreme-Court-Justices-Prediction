justice

r.
white
well,
isn't
--
aren't
those
really
--
used
to
be
inconsistent
--
i
mean
you
would
be
--
that
construction
site
proviso
you
say
or
somebody
said,
it
refers
to
the
work
of
--
that
could
be
done
or
is
to
be
done
at
the
site
--
justice
byron

white
--
but
not
as
to
products
shipped
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there's
an
agreement
that
a
certain
work
will
be
done
at
the
site,
likes
--
like
doors
will
be
put
together
at
the
site,
period.
justice
byron

white
and
which
means
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
door
--
finished
doors
shipped
in.
is
that
legal
or
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i
just
say
that
one
statement
of
the
legislative
history
isn't
very
informative
because
it
wouldn't
for
example,
tell
us
how
to
solve
that
question
i
just
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
they
can
protect
them
on
work
that
is
be
--
that
is
being
performed.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
isn't
much
protection
if
the
employer
at
the
jobsite
says
we're
going
to
quit
doing
this
work
that
is
now
being
done
on
the
jobsite
and
have
it
done
some
place
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let's
take
some
of
it
that
can't
--
that
is
being
done
at
the
site
that
can
be
done
some
place
else
like
doors
can
be
put
together
at
some
place
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
does
that
now
--
does
the
proviso
protect
an
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
says
that
this
work
that's
now
being
done
here
will
continue
to
be
done
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there's
a
--
an
expressed
exemption
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
here's
some
work
that
is
being
done
at
the
jobsite.
is
being
done
and
the
question
is,
may
the
employer
and
the
union
agree
that
it
will
no
longer
be
done
whether
that
will
continue
to
be
done
at
the
jobsite?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
--
mr.
come,
what
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
dual
purpose.
let's
assume
we
disagreed
with
you
and
said
there
wasn't
substantial
evidence,
that
there
was
--
that
really
there
was
a
dual
purpose
here.
have
you
lost
your
case
then?
i
mean,
assume
that
the
--
it
was
aimed
at
the
product
but
of
course
there
was
work
preservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
come,
in
your
case,
you
say
the
picket
line
where
the
product
deliveries
or
supplies
were
interrupted.
it's
only
done
for
some
other
further
reason
to
get
a
--
just
the
kind
of
an
agreement
with
the
employer
that
you
want
to
get.
and
it's
only
a
temporary
matter
stopping
those
products.
in
this
case,
the
--
whether
you
call
it
work
preservation
or
not,
there
--
what
the
employee
wants
to
do
--
the
union
wants
to
do
is
permanently
(inaudible)
the
delivery
of
this
kind
of
a
product
to
this
plant,
not
only
for
that
--
an
hour
tomorrow
but
for
all
and
you
can
say
their
object
as
work
preservation
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
--
it
is
that
if
the
work
is
preserved,
these
goods
are
stopped
forever.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
incident,
maybe
you'd
call
that
an
incident.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
exclude
from
the
reach
of
8
(b)
(4)
then
or
how
is
--
wouldn't
you
give
the
same
answer
if
the
union
came
to
the
employer
and
said,
“by
the
way,
you've
been
using
a's
products
all
these
years
but
we
just
happen
to
have
bought
b.
we
are
in
business
now,
the
union
is
and
we
think
you
ought
to
use
b's
products.
and
so
we're
going
to
strike
until
you
use
b's
products.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
--
well
then
let
me
--
you
would
say
that
was
probably
a
violation
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
give
you
a
different
one
then.
an
employer
has
always
been
using
prefabricated
doors
and
the
carpenters
have
been
installing
these
doors
and
they
just
decide
"well,
we'd
have
a
lot
more
work
but
this
employer
didn't
use
prefabricated
doors.
so
they
say,
they
strike
and
they
say
quit
using
them.
quit
buying
these
doors.
we're
going
to
make
the
doors
on
the
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
to
with
your
argument,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
didn't
--
the
board
would
recognize
i
suppose
like
you
seemed
to
that
the
consequence
of
the
successful
strike
is
the
permanent
stoppage
of
the
--
of
this
product
from
being
bought
by
these
employers.do
you
say
that
wasn't
fair
object
but
it
certainly
is
a
consequence.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
lot
of
primary
activity
results
in
interruptions
of
products
but
it's
only
temporary.
