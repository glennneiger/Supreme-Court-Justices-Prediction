mr.
deakins,
does
the
record
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
show
whether
it
is
customary
for
those
metal
bands
to
be
cut
on
the
jobsite?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
board
make
any
findings
as
to
whether
the
metal
bands
and
the
asbestos
were
both
customarily
cut
on
the
job?
justice
abe
fortas
your
position
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
only
kind
of
exclusionary
provision
that
would
be
lawful
would
be
when
it
says
to
the
employer,
you
may
not
have
work
done
on
the
jobsite
by
anybody
other
than
this
union.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
that
--
that
is
the
total
scope
of
permissible
activity
of
that
type
under
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
so
this
was
work
that
was
not
customarily
done
on
the
site
but
was
done
by
members
of
the
same
union.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us
now?
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
on
the
site?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happened
in
these
cases
was
that
in
both
instances
that
is
to
say
the
miter,
asbestos
and
the
metal
bands
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
contractor
wanted
to
have
the
material
prepared
on
mitered
and
cut.
justice
abe
fortas
supplied
to
manufacture?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
this
really
does
represent
a
sort
of
a
different
situation
or
variation
on
the
theme
that
is
to
say
that
here,
the
union's
objective
is
to
protect
not
on
the
site
work
but
work
by
members
of
the
same
union
employed
by
the
same
employer
but
done
in
the
employer's
plant
rather
than
on
the
site.
