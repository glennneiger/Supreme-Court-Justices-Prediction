mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
206,
it's
similar
in
many
respect
to
the
frouge
case.
i
think,
however,
this
is
a
case
that
points
up
the
fallacy
in
mr.
manoli's
argument
this
morning
with
reference
to
the
determination
of
the
dominant
motive.
you'll
recall
that
he
said
in
answer
to
questions
by
the
court,
in
discussing
the
evil
sought
to
be
cured
by
the
passage
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
that
that
was
a
case
where
products
of
a
nonunion
employer
or
an
employer
has
a
dispute
with
a
union
are
sought
to
be
boycotted
and
he
said
--
and
that
is
sand
door.
now
the
target,
mr.
manoli
said,
is
the
product
of
another
dispute.
he
said
the
employees
of
a
union
employer
have
no
dispute
with
her
own
employer
and
seek
to
prevent
the
products
of
a
nonunion
employer
from
being
installed
and
that
is
where
sand
door
comes
into
effect.
i
say
that
there
--
it's
not
necessary
that
there'd
be
a
dispute
because
the
dominant
motive
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
as
i
read
the
statute
does
not
control.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
in
206
is
a
group
of
contractors
who
formed
an
association
that
have
bargained
with
local
22
affiliated
with
the
international
association
of
heat
and
frost
insulators
and
asbestos
workers.
they
entered
into
a
contract.
the
contract
contains
two
important
provisions.
article
vi
says
that
the
employer
agrees
that
he
will
not
sublet
or
contract
out
any
work
described
by
article
xiii.
in
turn,
article
xiii
states
that
it
covers
rates
of
pay
rule,
working
conditions
of
all
mechanics
and
improvers
in
the
preparation,
distribution,
and
application
of
--
i
will
generalize
this,
insulation
materials.
now
in
connection
with
the
interpretation
which
the
union
has
placed
on
this
contract,
they
have
picked
the
word
preparation
which
they
say
is
jobsite
work
that
they're
entitled
to
have
and
that
when
the
two
members
of
the
association
purchased
materials
from
all
jobsite,
nonunion
suppliers
that
the
company
violated
that
agreement.
now
what
occurred
was
that
johns-manville,
one
of
the
members
of
the
association
had
a
job
at
texas
city,
texas
on
a
construction
project.
in
fact,
both
of
these
are
construction
projects.
they
have
purchased
some
precut
metal
bands
that
hold
aluminum
jacketing
around
piping
in
place.
and
when
they
were
delivered
of
the
jobsite,
the
union
refused
to
apply
them.
of
course,
they
didn't
have
a
decal
or
label
attached
to
the
box
to
show
as
i
will
adopt
that
they
were
union
made.
armstrong
was
working
in
victoria,
texas
under
the
jurisdiction
of
local
13
of
the
same
union
but
the
contract
--
there
was
no
contract
in
effect
between
local
113
and
the
association
or
armstrong,
either
one.
when
armstrong
purchased
some
pre-mitered
asbestos
fittings
to
be
applied
to
joints
of
pipes,
those
fittings
were
not
applied
by
the
union
because
they
were
--
did
not
vary
union
labor.
now,
as
soon
as
that
occurred,
of
course
charges
were
filed
and
a
complaint
was
issued,
and
an
injunction
secured
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
houston.
at
the
hearing
on
the
board
case,
certain
evidence
was
introduced
which
we
think
was
mostly
important
in
this
case
and
which
brings
about
our
first
point
which
lies
under
universal
camera
case
but
let
me
tell
the
court
first
what
occurred.
the
current
examiner
held
that
the
refusal
to
handle
the
products
of
techalloy
and
thorpe,
the
two
nonunion
off
jobsites
suppliers
was
unlawful
because
the
exemption
of
section
8
(e)
applied
only
to
be
worked
--
to
work
to
be
done
at
the
jobsite,
and
not
the
materials
manufactured
off
the
jobsite
and
ship
there
for
installation.
he
said
also,
even
if
this
work
and
the
application
of
the
products
had
been
jobsite
construction
work,
they
refuse
to
handle
these
products
was
unlawful
under
sand
door.
so
he
held
that
the
international
union
was
not
involved
in
this
proceeding.
the
board
then
reviewed
this
decision
and
held
that
the
strike
in
each
case
was
for
work
preservation.
and
thus,
the
strikes
were
primary
and
not
unlawful.
it
did
not
deal
with
the
implications
of
section
8
(e)
in
this
case
and
the
court
below
speciically
pointed
that
fact
up.
so
when
we
went
to
the
court
below,
the
court
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
activity
of
local
22,
that
was
the
local
with
which
there
was
a
contract,
was
not
unlawful
because
it
engaged
in
work
preservation.
it
held
that
local
113,
that's
the
one
at
corpus
christi,
was
not
engaged
in
work
preservation
because
it
had
no
contract
with
the
association
or
armstrong,
and
held
that
it
was
guilty
of
an
8
(b)
(4)
violation
because
it
got
an
innocent
third
party.
and
that's
thorpe
who
manufactured
the
pre-mitered
fittings
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
not
of
its
own
making.
now,
we
believe
that
this
entire
case
is
dependent
to
quite
an
extent
on
certain
testimony
that
was
given
by
an
international
vice
president
of
the
union
who
is
also
the
secretary
of
local
22.
his
name
is
baker.
the
international's
attorney
called
him
and
put
him
on
their
stand
as
their
witness.
and
here
was
the
questions
in
this
very
brief
by
mr.
(inaudible),
the
attorney.
“has
your
local
instructed
its
members
not
to
use
the
products
of
thorpe?”
the
answer
is
“yes”.
“alright.
under
all
circumstances?”
answer,
“yes,
as
far
as
i
know.
question,
“is
the
same
true
of
techalloy?”
answer,
“yes,
as
far
as
i
know.”
alright
--
question,
“alright!
and
why
have
you
instructed
your
local
members
to
take
those
positions?”
answer,
“we
are
not
in
agreement
with
thorpe
or
techalloy”.
now
his
attorneys
sensing
that
this
was
a
bad
statement
interposed
and
said,
“well
perhaps
you
misunderstood
my
question,
mr.
baker.
let
me
rephrase
it,”
but
the
trial
examiner
interrupted
and
said,
“you
mean
because
you
have
no
contract
with
them?”
answer,
“no
contract,
no.”
now
it's
true
that
this
same
witness
later
stated
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract
to
apply
these
materials
but
i
say
this
is
what
mr.
manoli
was
talking
about.
who's
going
to
pick
what
unlawful
object
is
the
dominant
unlawful
object?
there
wasn't
any
dispute
that
we
know
of
with
these
people.
the
off
jobsite,
nonunion
suppliers
which
we
think
are
covered
by
section
8
(e).
at
least
it
wasn't
an
active
dispute
but
that
isn't
required
under
sand
door
or
the
other
cases.
as
we
view
this
case,
denver
building
trades
really
controls
the
question
of
what's
the
dominant,
what's
the
non-dominant
purpose?
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
if
there
was
one
unlawful
object,
the
entire
strike
was
taken.
and
we
think
that's
the
case
here.
now
the
fifth
circuit
considered
this
matter
and
the
general
counsel
was
hard
put
to
explain
away
this
testimony.
i
suspect
because
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
mr.
baker's
testimony
was
confused.
well
mr.
baker
never
said
it
was
confused.
he
never
said
he
misunderstood
the
question.
he
never
said
that
his
answer
was
wrong.
he
didn't
deny
this
at
all.
we
think
that
is
evidence
of
a
motive
which
this
court
should
have
considered
below.
now
the
board
suggests
and
they
think
from
the
text
of
universal
camera,
that
part
where
this
court
was
admonishing
the
courts
of
appeals
of
the
requirement
for
canvassing
the
record
as
a
whole.
they
took
that
part
to
court,
it
said
the
court
may
not
displace
the
board's
view
between
two
fairly
conflicting
views
even
though
the
court
would
justifiably
have
made
a
different
choice,
had
the
matter
been
before
de
novo.
now,
i
submit
this
witness
doesn't
have
too
fairly
conflicting
views.
he's
a
one
man.
he's
a
high
official
with
this
union.
he
stated
two
objectives
of
two
objects,
to
motives
of
this
refusal
to
handle
these
products,
one
unlawful
or
certain
under
sand
door.
the
other
unlawful
we
think
under
the
statute.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no
sir,
he
didn't
go
back
and
changed
his
views.
he
said,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract.
but
he
never
did
say
that
his
reason
for
not
having
the
doors
because
they
were
nonunion
employer
was
not
the
fact.
he
never
did
deny
that.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
yes,
sir
on
that.
and
if
the
court
please,
in
our
brief,
we've
cited
nlr
versus
pittsburg
steamship
company
on
a
case
where
there
was
a
question
of
bias
on
the
part
of
the
examiner
but
this
court
quoted
the
language
we
--
which
we
think
is
absolutely
or
very
pertinent
here.
and
there,
it's
about
credited
evidence.
it
says,
on
--
it
was
quoting
judge
(inaudible)
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
some
other
--
no
sir,
there
never
was.some
other
witnesses
said
it
was
work
preservation.
let's
see
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no
sir,
they
never
did
deny
this.
no
one
ever
denied
this.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
by
one
wit
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
sir,
by
one
witness,
the
principal
witness,
that
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
the
other
said,
once
--
one
man
told
the
johns-arm
--
johns
--
i
mean
the
armstrong
man
that
the
union
wouldn't
apply
mitered
fittings
because
they
had
no
union
labor.
one
of
them,
the
business
agent
of
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
a
dispute?
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
well,
no,
the
other
testimony
your
honor
shows
that
i
think
that
the
union
label
was
used
for
a
purpose
of
boycotting
nonunion
goods
because
this
first
witness
published
a
matter
which
was
exhibit
2
concerning
these
labors.
and
here's
what
--
i'm
not
going
to
read
this
entire
thing.
it's
about
page
and
a
half
long
but
it
states
the
general
affirmations
subject
decals,
labeled
--
decal
labels
that
was
published
in
1963
just
a
little
while
before
this
instant
occurred.
one
sentence
says,
“the
purpose
of
this
gum
label
is
to
properly
identify
the
asbestos
worker
who
performs
the
work
and
to
insure
quality
workmanship.”
numbered
gum
label
--
decal
labels
are
supplied
for
the
general
office
through
the
business
agent
to
the
worker
in
charge
of
preparing
them
--
the
materials
off
the
jobsite.
this
procedure
of
labeling
was
announced
and
explained
by
the
asbestos
workers
on
several
occasions.
all
members
are
expected
to
abide
by
this
international
practice
established
by
the
general
executive
board.
the
member,
who
fabricates
materials
and
fails
to
fix
a
decal,
is
equally
responsive
with
the
member
who
applied
fabricated
materials
about
decals.
we
believe
that
when
that
is
considered
with
these
other
testimonies
that
this
is
clearly
an
indication
on
the
part
of
the
union.
they
don't
want
nonunion
products
applied
on
any
of
their
jobs.
now,
you
understand
the
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
was
refuted,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no
sir.
i
feel
--
well,
i
think
the
court
below
should
have
reviewed
this,
the
board
didn't
do
that.
i
don't
think.
the
board
only
said
this
is
work
preservation
in
the
very
brief
decision
and
adopted
that
of
the
trial
examiner.
the
trial
examiner,
of
course,
as
i've
said
made
two
findings.
we
think
you
put
a
cart
before
the
horse
but
be
that
as
it
may
the
result
was
right
at
least.
now,
mr.
baker
also
has
made
the
statement
that
they
wanted
the
labels
to
show
that
these
materials
were
made
by
union
people.
gram,
the
job
foreman,
under
the
local
113
job
who's
also
a
member
of
the
union
as
the
record
shows,
told
armstrong's
superintendent
that
the
business
agent
said
the
fittings
couldn't
be
applied
unless
they
had
union
decals.
and
in
the
johns-manville
case,
the
manager
said
that
a
union
member
named
robert
oliver
said
that
shrout
(ph),
a
business
agent
told
him
he
couldn't
apply
the
labels
on
precut
bands
because
they
weren't
cut
by
union
asbestos
worker.
this
came
from
off
the
jobsite.
do
you
understand?
the
man
who
was
immediately
in
charged
of
the
work
and
a
member
of
the
union
said
that
the
business
agent
told
him
at
the
union
meeting
that
they
couldn't
apply
the
bands
that
they
didn't
come
to
the
job
with
the
label
on.
and
the
same
business
agent
told
roberts,
they
would
not
apply
the
job
because
they
were
cut
by
somebody
other
than
asbestos
worker.
now,
clearly
these
were
cut
off
the
jobsite.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
they
are
sometimes,
you're
honor,
sometimes
not.
the
testimony
in
regard
of
that
was
that
they
ordinarily
come
into
cartons
with
the
other
jacket.
although
they
can
cut
them
on
the
jobsite
and
i
think
they
claimed
that
work
part
of
the
time.
i
might
as
well
say
with
reference
to
the
asbestos
fittings
that
they
customarily
are
cut
on
the
jobsite,
although
they
can
be
cut.
it's
just
a
matter
of
cutting
with
the
miter,
just
--
with
a
saw
and
a
miter
box.
they
--
sometimes
the
testimony
shows
they
picked
up
fillings
at
the
end
of
the
job
by
buying
them
off
the
jobsite.
the
union
didn't
complain
about
that.
that
testimony
wasn't
reaffirmed
as
i
understand
the
testimony
and
it
left
a
little
bit
to
be
desired.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
think
the
examiner
did,
your
honor,
that
the
board
did
not
itself
adopt
the
examiner's
provision
to
his
decision.
they
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
just
a
second
your
honor,
let
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
alright,
i
can't
find
it
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
but
we
contend
that
this
testimony
of
mr.
baker
was
the
death
wound
as
the
court
said
in
the
pittsburg
case
and
that
this
truth
is
an
(voice
overlap)
was
not
refuted
and
that
shows
clearly
to
us
that
one
of
the
objects
of
this
strike
was
to
prevent
the
use
of
these
materials.
now
if
this
is
illegal
--
admitted
illegal
objective
of
the
union
in
this
case
isn't
binding
on
them
what
it's
given
by
a
member
of
the
international
land
--
i
don't
think
we
can
ever
have
a
finding
in
one
of
these
cases.
it's
bind.
now
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
similar
to
that
which
was
argued
by
mr.
mahin
and
that's
whether
the
amendment
date
(b)
(4)
(b)
which
saves
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing
from
the
prescriptions
of
the
balance
of
the
section
can
be
construed
to
permit
a
union
to
claim
work
preservation
under
a
subcontracted
clause
and
thus
avoid
that
part
of
section
8
(e)
which
limit
subcontracting
provisions
to
the
work
to
be
formed
--
performed
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
the
best
indication
that
i
think
of
the
intent
of
congress
is
seen
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
now,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
of
the
exception
limits
that
the
work
to
be
performed
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
that
statute
does
not
say,
work
which
could
be
performed
at
the
site
of
this
construction.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
legislative
history,
the
day
when
the
bill
was
sent
to
the
president
for
signature,
senator
mcnamara
entered
a
statement
in
which
he
claimed
that
in
the
plumbing
and
pipefitting
trade,
there
was
a
situation
where
there
was
a
lot
of
prefabricating,
and
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
cover
prefabricating
that
was
done
off
the
jobsite
but
representative
kearns
who
was
on
the
house
report
and
we've
discussed
all
of
this
extensively
in
our
brief,
answered
that
pretty
well.
he
quoted
from
senator
john
kennedy
who
was
really
the
principal
author
of
this
bill,
and
senator
kennedy
said
four
things.
he
said
8
(e)
was
intended
to
preserve
the
present
state
of
the
law
with
reference
to
--
with
respect
to
picketing
at
the
site
of
the
construction
project
and
to
the
validity
of
agreements
relating
to
work
to
be
performed
at
the
site
of
the
construction
project.
that
the
law
developed
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
was
unaffected
and
the
denver
building
trades
and
sand
door
remained
enforced.
he
said
third,
the
contracts
not
to
subcontract
work
on
a
construction
site
are
legal
since
the
provision
of
section
8
(e)
does
not
relate
to
section
8
(b)
(4).
strikes
and
picketing
to
enforce
the
contract
accepted
by
the
provisions
will
continue
to
be
illegal
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
whenever
sand
door
is
applicable.
he
also
said
it
should
be
particularly
noted
that
this
provides
or
relates
only
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
this
provides
or
does
not
cover
boycotts
of
goods
manufactured
in
an
industrial
plant
for
insulation
at
the
jobsite
or
the
supplier
who
do
not
work
at
the
jobsite.
since
the
advent
of
this
and
fairly
recently,
a
case
which
we
cited
on
page
24
and
25
of
our
brief
is
the
nlrb
versus
the
teamsters
at
342
f.
2d
18,
involved
the
contract
containing
a
site
work
clause.
and
they
were
hauling
ready
mixed
concrete
into
this
plant
to
be
forward.
the
board
held
that
this
was
off
jobsite
work
and
that
the
continuous
mixing
was
still
work
that
was
part
of
delivery.
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
a
little
suspicious
to
hold
that
because
the
mixing
was
continuing
even
when
the
concrete
got
to
the
jobsite.
and
if
that
was
part
of
the
delivery,
it
seems
to
be
stretching
a
point
quite
a
bit
because
the
work
was
continued
but
they
did
hold
that
this
was
off
jobsite
work
and
i
think
that
squares
somewhat
with
our
situation
here.
now
probably
the
strongest
statement
made
in
--
other
than
that
of
senator
kennedy
in
support
of
our
case
was
that
by
senator
morris.
he
was
a
better
opponent
to
this
bill
and
here's
what
he
said.
it
would
prevent
a
union
from
protecting
the
installation.
it
would
prevent
a
union
from
protecting
the
bargaining
unit
it
represents
by
obtaining
an
agreement
not
to
subcontract
work
normally
performed
by
the
employees
of
the
union.
if
that
is
what
the
congress
intended,
i
think
that
has
answered
a
lot
of
questions
that
have
been
asked
here
of
mr.
mahin.
now
sand
door,
of
course,
involved
a
precise
situation.
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
first
point
here,
because
one
of
the
stated
objectives
was
to
stop
the
handling
of
the
goods
of
a
wisconsin
fabricator,
not
because
he
was
from
wisconsin
but
because
they
checked
up
and
found
that
they
weren't
union
made
products.
and
i
think
that
that,
under
this
testimony
that
we
have
given
here
is
exactly
what
our
case
is
because
that
is
not
work
that
could
be
performed
that's
covered
under
section
8
(e).
that
is
work
that
was
performed
off
the
jobsite
by
what
has
been
said
by
mr.
kennedy
and
others
to
be
a
nonunion
off
jobsite
supplier.
the
conference
report
as
well,
representative
kearns
says
--
supports
this
view.
he
--
and
to
quote
him,
he
said,
--
he
states
at
page
39
that
the
proviso
in
question
relates
only
and
exclusively
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction
and
that
it
does
not
exempt
from
section
8
(e)
agreement
relating
to
supply
the
materials,
ship
to
the
site
of
the
construction.
he
also
said
that
the
senate
committee
on
labor
and
public
welfare
in
its
section
by
section
analysis
statement
with
respect
to
the
section
in
question
that
the
prohibition
against
hot
cargo
agreement
does
not
apply
the
construction
industry
relating
to
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
alright.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
--
the
contract
is
illegal
because
--
the
question
is
what
was
congress
attempting
to
prevent
here?
and
i
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no,
i
think
probably
mr.
kennedy
made
the
most
enlightening
statement
on
that
--
on
--
to
all
of
those
points.
senator
morris
though
as
i
said
that
he's
rather
astute
fellow.
he
said
what
we
say
here
that
it's
just
one
of
those
things
that
a
union
can't
protect
its
people
under
a
contractor.
now
they
can
protect
them
on
work
that
is
being
performed
on
a
jobsite.
and
as
i
understand,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
construction
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
on
the
jobsite
are
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
some
of
this
work,
your
honor
can't
be
done
some
place
else.of
course,
you
appreciate
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does,
no
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
long.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
work
to
be
done
at
the
jobsite,
that's
right.
it's
not
work
that
could
be
done
at
the
jobsite
your
honor,
and
that
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
well,
we
--
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
would
make
that
an
unlawful
provision.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
intend
to
eliminate.
it
was
a
matter
of
--
there
are
things
such
as
technological
advantages
and
advancement
that
all
make
for
more
work
and
of
course,
we
don't
consider
those
things.
the
congress
does
when
they
speak
of
these
things
and
discuss
these.
of
course,
this
was
a
compromise
as
you
well
know.
and
i
think
my
time
is
about
running.
i
want
to
mention
briefly
case
number
413.
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
would
ever
reach
--
should
ever
reach
this
point
but
if
it
does,
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
court
below
has
reliance
on
denver
building
trades
council
where
it
said
that
when
local
13
--
113,
that
was
the
one
at
corpus
christi,
engaged
in
an
unlawful
activity.
it
was
coursing
armstrong
not
for
its
own
benefit
but
for
the
benefit
of
another
local,
that's
local
22
at
houston,
at
the
expense
of
a
neutral
employer.
and
that
was
the
man
who
sent
the
pre-mitered
fittings
onto
the
jobsite.
now
this
to
me
is
a
--
is
about
a
finding
under
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
because
what
they
took
the
language
from
denver
building
trades
council
and
applied
that
here.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
206,
it's
similar
in
many
respect
to
the
frouge
case.
i
think,
however,
this
is
a
case
that
points
up
the
fallacy
in
mr.
manoli's
argument
this
morning
with
reference
to
the
determination
of
the
dominant
motive.
you'll
recall
that
he
said
in
answer
to
questions
by
the
court,
in
discussing
the
evil
sought
to
be
cured
by
the
passage
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
that
that
was
a
case
where
products
of
a
nonunion
employer
or
an
employer
has
a
dispute
with
a
union
are
sought
to
be
boycotted
and
he
said
--
and
that
is
sand
door.
now
the
target,
mr.
manoli
said,
is
the
product
of
another
dispute.
he
said
the
employees
of
a
union
employer
have
no
dispute
with
her
own
employer
and
seek
to
prevent
the
products
of
a
nonunion
employer
from
being
installed
and
that
is
where
sand
door
comes
into
effect.
i
say
that
there
--
it's
not
necessary
that
there'd
be
a
dispute
because
the
dominant
motive
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
as
i
read
the
statute
does
not
control.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
in
206
is
a
group
of
contractors
who
formed
an
association
that
have
bargained
with
local
22
affiliated
with
the
international
association
of
heat
and
frost
insulators
and
asbestos
workers.
they
entered
into
a
contract.
the
contract
contains
two
important
provisions.
article
vi
says
that
the
employer
agrees
that
he
will
not
sublet
or
contract
out
any
work
described
by
article
xiii.
in
turn,
article
xiii
states
that
it
covers
rates
of
pay
rule,
working
conditions
of
all
mechanics
and
improvers
in
the
preparation,
distribution,
and
application
of
--
i
will
generalize
this,
insulation
materials.
now
in
connection
with
the
interpretation
which
the
union
has
placed
on
this
contract,
they
have
picked
the
word
preparation
which
they
say
is
jobsite
work
that
they're
entitled
to
have
and
that
when
the
two
members
of
the
association
purchased
materials
from
all
jobsite,
nonunion
suppliers
that
the
company
violated
that
agreement.
now
what
occurred
was
that
johns-manville,
one
of
the
members
of
the
association
had
a
job
at
texas
city,
texas
on
a
construction
project.
in
fact,
both
of
these
are
construction
projects.
they
have
purchased
some
precut
metal
bands
that
hold
aluminum
jacketing
around
piping
in
place.
and
when
they
were
delivered
of
the
jobsite,
the
union
refused
to
apply
them.
of
course,
they
didn't
have
a
decal
or
label
attached
to
the
box
to
show
as
i
will
adopt
that
they
were
union
made.
armstrong
was
working
in
victoria,
texas
under
the
jurisdiction
of
local
13
of
the
same
union
but
the
contract
--
there
was
no
contract
in
effect
between
local
113
and
the
association
or
armstrong,
either
one.
when
armstrong
purchased
some
pre-mitered
asbestos
fittings
to
be
applied
to
joints
of
pipes,
those
fittings
were
not
applied
by
the
union
because
they
were
--
did
not
vary
union
labor.
now,
as
soon
as
that
occurred,
of
course
charges
were
filed
and
a
complaint
was
issued,
and
an
injunction
secured
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
houston.
at
the
hearing
on
the
board
case,
certain
evidence
was
introduced
which
we
think
was
mostly
important
in
this
case
and
which
brings
about
our
first
point
which
lies
under
universal
camera
case
but
let
me
tell
the
court
first
what
occurred.
the
current
examiner
held
that
the
refusal
to
handle
the
products
of
techalloy
and
thorpe,
the
two
nonunion
off
jobsites
suppliers
was
unlawful
because
the
exemption
of
section
8
(e)
applied
only
to
be
worked
--
to
work
to
be
done
at
the
jobsite,
and
not
the
materials
manufactured
off
the
jobsite
and
ship
there
for
installation.
he
said
also,
even
if
this
work
and
the
application
of
the
products
had
been
jobsite
construction
work,
they
refuse
to
handle
these
products
was
unlawful
under
sand
door.
so
he
held
that
the
international
union
was
not
involved
in
this
proceeding.
the
board
then
reviewed
this
decision
and
held
that
the
strike
in
each
case
was
for
work
preservation.
and
thus,
the
strikes
were
primary
and
not
unlawful.
it
did
not
deal
with
the
implications
of
section
8
(e)
in
this
case
and
the
court
below
speciically
pointed
that
fact
up.
so
when
we
went
to
the
court
below,
the
court
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
activity
of
local
22,
that
was
the
local
with
which
there
was
a
contract,
was
not
unlawful
because
it
engaged
in
work
preservation.
it
held
that
local
113,
that's
the
one
at
corpus
christi,
was
not
engaged
in
work
preservation
because
it
had
no
contract
with
the
association
or
armstrong,
and
held
that
it
was
guilty
of
an
8
(b)
(4)
violation
because
it
got
an
innocent
third
party.
and
that's
thorpe
who
manufactured
the
pre-mitered
fittings
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
not
of
its
own
making.
now,
we
believe
that
this
entire
case
is
dependent
to
quite
an
extent
on
certain
testimony
that
was
given
by
an
international
vice
president
of
the
union
who
is
also
the
secretary
of
local
22.
his
name
is
baker.
the
international's
attorney
called
him
and
put
him
on
their
stand
as
their
witness.
and
here
was
the
questions
in
this
very
brief
by
mr.
(inaudible),
the
attorney.
“has
your
local
instructed
its
members
not
to
use
the
products
of
thorpe?”
the
answer
is
“yes”.
“alright.
under
all
circumstances?”
answer,
“yes,
as
far
as
i
know.
question,
“is
the
same
true
of
techalloy?”
answer,
“yes,
as
far
as
i
know.”
alright
--
question,
“alright!
and
why
have
you
instructed
your
local
members
to
take
those
positions?”
answer,
“we
are
not
in
agreement
with
thorpe
or
techalloy”.
now
his
attorneys
sensing
that
this
was
a
bad
statement
interposed
and
said,
“well
perhaps
you
misunderstood
my
question,
mr.
baker.
let
me
rephrase
it,”
but
the
trial
examiner
interrupted
and
said,
“you
mean
because
you
have
no
contract
with
them?”
answer,
“no
contract,
no.”
now
it's
true
that
this
same
witness
later
stated
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract
to
apply
these
materials
but
i
say
this
is
what
mr.
manoli
was
talking
about.
who's
going
to
pick
what
unlawful
object
is
the
dominant
unlawful
object?
there
wasn't
any
dispute
that
we
know
of
with
these
people.
the
off
jobsite,
nonunion
suppliers
which
we
think
are
covered
by
section
8
(e).
at
least
it
wasn't
an
active
dispute
but
that
isn't
required
under
sand
door
or
the
other
cases.
as
we
view
this
case,
denver
building
trades
really
controls
the
question
of
what's
the
dominant,
what's
the
non-dominant
purpose?
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
if
there
was
one
unlawful
object,
the
entire
strike
was
taken.
and
we
think
that's
the
case
here.
now
the
fifth
circuit
considered
this
matter
and
the
general
counsel
was
hard
put
to
explain
away
this
testimony.
i
suspect
because
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
mr.
baker's
testimony
was
confused.
well
mr.
baker
never
said
it
was
confused.
he
never
said
he
misunderstood
the
question.
he
never
said
that
his
answer
was
wrong.
he
didn't
deny
this
at
all.
we
think
that
is
evidence
of
a
motive
which
this
court
should
have
considered
below.
now
the
board
suggests
and
they
think
from
the
text
of
universal
camera,
that
part
where
this
court
was
admonishing
the
courts
of
appeals
of
the
requirement
for
canvassing
the
record
as
a
whole.
they
took
that
part
to
court,
it
said
the
court
may
not
displace
the
board's
view
between
two
fairly
conflicting
views
even
though
the
court
would
justifiably
have
made
a
different
choice,
had
the
matter
been
before
de
novo.
now,
i
submit
this
witness
doesn't
have
too
fairly
conflicting
views.
he's
a
one
man.
he's
a
high
official
with
this
union.
he
stated
two
objectives
of
two
objects,
to
motives
of
this
refusal
to
handle
these
products,
one
unlawful
or
certain
under
sand
door.
the
other
unlawful
we
think
under
the
statute.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no
sir,
he
didn't
go
back
and
changed
his
views.
he
said,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract.
but
he
never
did
say
that
his
reason
for
not
having
the
doors
because
they
were
nonunion
employer
was
not
the
fact.
he
never
did
deny
that.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
yes,
sir
on
that.
and
if
the
court
please,
in
our
brief,
we've
cited
nlr
versus
pittsburg
steamship
company
on
a
case
where
there
was
a
question
of
bias
on
the
part
of
the
examiner
but
this
court
quoted
the
language
we
--
which
we
think
is
absolutely
or
very
pertinent
here.
and
there,
it's
about
credited
evidence.
it
says,
on
--
it
was
quoting
judge
(inaudible)
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
some
other
--
no
sir,
there
never
was.some
other
witnesses
said
it
was
work
preservation.
let's
see
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no
sir,
they
never
did
deny
this.
no
one
ever
denied
this.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
by
one
wit
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
sir,
by
one
witness,
the
principal
witness,
that
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
the
other
said,
once
--
one
man
told
the
johns-arm
--
johns
--
i
mean
the
armstrong
man
that
the
union
wouldn't
apply
mitered
fittings
because
they
had
no
union
labor.
one
of
them,
the
business
agent
of
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
a
dispute?
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
well,
no,
the
other
testimony
your
honor
shows
that
i
think
that
the
union
label
was
used
for
a
purpose
of
boycotting
nonunion
goods
because
this
first
witness
published
a
matter
which
was
exhibit
2
concerning
these
labors.
and
here's
what
--
i'm
not
going
to
read
this
entire
thing.
it's
about
page
and
a
half
long
but
it
states
the
general
affirmations
subject
decals,
labeled
--
decal
labels
that
was
published
in
1963
just
a
little
while
before
this
instant
occurred.
one
sentence
says,
“the
purpose
of
this
gum
label
is
to
properly
identify
the
asbestos
worker
who
performs
the
work
and
to
insure
quality
workmanship.”
numbered
gum
label
--
decal
labels
are
supplied
for
the
general
office
through
the
business
agent
to
the
worker
in
charge
of
preparing
them
--
the
materials
off
the
jobsite.
this
procedure
of
labeling
was
announced
and
explained
by
the
asbestos
workers
on
several
occasions.
all
members
are
expected
to
abide
by
this
international
practice
established
by
the
general
executive
board.
the
member,
who
fabricates
materials
and
fails
to
fix
a
decal,
is
equally
responsive
with
the
member
who
applied
fabricated
materials
about
decals.
we
believe
that
when
that
is
considered
with
these
other
testimonies
that
this
is
clearly
an
indication
on
the
part
of
the
union.
they
don't
want
nonunion
products
applied
on
any
of
their
jobs.
now,
you
understand
the
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
was
refuted,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no
sir.
i
feel
--
well,
i
think
the
court
below
should
have
reviewed
this,
the
board
didn't
do
that.
i
don't
think.
the
board
only
said
this
is
work
preservation
in
the
very
brief
decision
and
adopted
that
of
the
trial
examiner.
the
trial
examiner,
of
course,
as
i've
said
made
two
findings.
we
think
you
put
a
cart
before
the
horse
but
be
that
as
it
may
the
result
was
right
at
least.
now,
mr.
baker
also
has
made
the
statement
that
they
wanted
the
labels
to
show
that
these
materials
were
made
by
union
people.
gram,
the
job
foreman,
under
the
local
113
job
who's
also
a
member
of
the
union
as
the
record
shows,
told
armstrong's
superintendent
that
the
business
agent
said
the
fittings
couldn't
be
applied
unless
they
had
union
decals.
and
in
the
johns-manville
case,
the
manager
said
that
a
union
member
named
robert
oliver
said
that
shrout
(ph),
a
business
agent
told
him
he
couldn't
apply
the
labels
on
precut
bands
because
they
weren't
cut
by
union
asbestos
worker.
this
came
from
off
the
jobsite.
do
you
understand?
the
man
who
was
immediately
in
charged
of
the
work
and
a
member
of
the
union
said
that
the
business
agent
told
him
at
the
union
meeting
that
they
couldn't
apply
the
bands
that
they
didn't
come
to
the
job
with
the
label
on.
and
the
same
business
agent
told
roberts,
they
would
not
apply
the
job
because
they
were
cut
by
somebody
other
than
asbestos
worker.
now,
clearly
these
were
cut
off
the
jobsite.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
they
are
sometimes,
you're
honor,
sometimes
not.
the
testimony
in
regard
of
that
was
that
they
ordinarily
come
into
cartons
with
the
other
jacket.
although
they
can
cut
them
on
the
jobsite
and
i
think
they
claimed
that
work
part
of
the
time.
i
might
as
well
say
with
reference
to
the
asbestos
fittings
that
they
customarily
are
cut
on
the
jobsite,
although
they
can
be
cut.
it's
just
a
matter
of
cutting
with
the
miter,
just
--
with
a
saw
and
a
miter
box.
they
--
sometimes
the
testimony
shows
they
picked
up
fillings
at
the
end
of
the
job
by
buying
them
off
the
jobsite.
the
union
didn't
complain
about
that.
that
testimony
wasn't
reaffirmed
as
i
understand
the
testimony
and
it
left
a
little
bit
to
be
desired.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
think
the
examiner
did,
your
honor,
that
the
board
did
not
itself
adopt
the
examiner's
provision
to
his
decision.
they
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
just
a
second
your
honor,
let
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
alright,
i
can't
find
it
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
but
we
contend
that
this
testimony
of
mr.
baker
was
the
death
wound
as
the
court
said
in
the
pittsburg
case
and
that
this
truth
is
an
(voice
overlap)
was
not
refuted
and
that
shows
clearly
to
us
that
one
of
the
objects
of
this
strike
was
to
prevent
the
use
of
these
materials.
now
if
this
is
illegal
--
admitted
illegal
objective
of
the
union
in
this
case
isn't
binding
on
them
what
it's
given
by
a
member
of
the
international
land
--
i
don't
think
we
can
ever
have
a
finding
in
one
of
these
cases.
it's
bind.
now
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
similar
to
that
which
was
argued
by
mr.
mahin
and
that's
whether
the
amendment
date
(b)
(4)
(b)
which
saves
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing
from
the
prescriptions
of
the
balance
of
the
section
can
be
construed
to
permit
a
union
to
claim
work
preservation
under
a
subcontracted
clause
and
thus
avoid
that
part
of
section
8
(e)
which
limit
subcontracting
provisions
to
the
work
to
be
formed
--
performed
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
the
best
indication
that
i
think
of
the
intent
of
congress
is
seen
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
now,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
of
the
exception
limits
that
the
work
to
be
performed
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
that
statute
does
not
say,
work
which
could
be
performed
at
the
site
of
this
construction.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
legislative
history,
the
day
when
the
bill
was
sent
to
the
president
for
signature,
senator
mcnamara
entered
a
statement
in
which
he
claimed
that
in
the
plumbing
and
pipefitting
trade,
there
was
a
situation
where
there
was
a
lot
of
prefabricating,
and
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
cover
prefabricating
that
was
done
off
the
jobsite
but
representative
kearns
who
was
on
the
house
report
and
we've
discussed
all
of
this
extensively
in
our
brief,
answered
that
pretty
well.
he
quoted
from
senator
john
kennedy
who
was
really
the
principal
author
of
this
bill,
and
senator
kennedy
said
four
things.
he
said
8
(e)
was
intended
to
preserve
the
present
state
of
the
law
with
reference
to
--
with
respect
to
picketing
at
the
site
of
the
construction
project
and
to
the
validity
of
agreements
relating
to
work
to
be
performed
at
the
site
of
the
construction
project.
that
the
law
developed
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
was
unaffected
and
the
denver
building
trades
and
sand
door
remained
enforced.
he
said
third,
the
contracts
not
to
subcontract
work
on
a
construction
site
are
legal
since
the
provision
of
section
8
(e)
does
not
relate
to
section
8
(b)
(4).
strikes
and
picketing
to
enforce
the
contract
accepted
by
the
provisions
will
continue
to
be
illegal
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
whenever
sand
door
is
applicable.
he
also
said
it
should
be
particularly
noted
that
this
provides
or
relates
only
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
this
provides
or
does
not
cover
boycotts
of
goods
manufactured
in
an
industrial
plant
for
insulation
at
the
jobsite
or
the
supplier
who
do
not
work
at
the
jobsite.
since
the
advent
of
this
and
fairly
recently,
a
case
which
we
cited
on
page
24
and
25
of
our
brief
is
the
nlrb
versus
the
teamsters
at
342
f.
2d
18,
involved
the
contract
containing
a
site
work
clause.
and
they
were
hauling
ready
mixed
concrete
into
this
plant
to
be
forward.
the
board
held
that
this
was
off
jobsite
work
and
that
the
continuous
mixing
was
still
work
that
was
part
of
delivery.
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
a
little
suspicious
to
hold
that
because
the
mixing
was
continuing
even
when
the
concrete
got
to
the
jobsite.
and
if
that
was
part
of
the
delivery,
it
seems
to
be
stretching
a
point
quite
a
bit
because
the
work
was
continued
but
they
did
hold
that
this
was
off
jobsite
work
and
i
think
that
squares
somewhat
with
our
situation
here.
now
probably
the
strongest
statement
made
in
--
other
than
that
of
senator
kennedy
in
support
of
our
case
was
that
by
senator
morris.
he
was
a
better
opponent
to
this
bill
and
here's
what
he
said.
it
would
prevent
a
union
from
protecting
the
installation.
it
would
prevent
a
union
from
protecting
the
bargaining
unit
it
represents
by
obtaining
an
agreement
not
to
subcontract
work
normally
performed
by
the
employees
of
the
union.
if
that
is
what
the
congress
intended,
i
think
that
has
answered
a
lot
of
questions
that
have
been
asked
here
of
mr.
mahin.
now
sand
door,
of
course,
involved
a
precise
situation.
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
first
point
here,
because
one
of
the
stated
objectives
was
to
stop
the
handling
of
the
goods
of
a
wisconsin
fabricator,
not
because
he
was
from
wisconsin
but
because
they
checked
up
and
found
that
they
weren't
union
made
products.
and
i
think
that
that,
under
this
testimony
that
we
have
given
here
is
exactly
what
our
case
is
because
that
is
not
work
that
could
be
performed
that's
covered
under
section
8
(e).
that
is
work
that
was
performed
off
the
jobsite
by
what
has
been
said
by
mr.
kennedy
and
others
to
be
a
nonunion
off
jobsite
supplier.
the
conference
report
as
well,
representative
kearns
says
--
supports
this
view.
he
--
and
to
quote
him,
he
said,
--
he
states
at
page
39
that
the
proviso
in
question
relates
only
and
exclusively
to
the
contracting
or
subcontracting
of
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction
and
that
it
does
not
exempt
from
section
8
(e)
agreement
relating
to
supply
the
materials,
ship
to
the
site
of
the
construction.
he
also
said
that
the
senate
committee
on
labor
and
public
welfare
in
its
section
by
section
analysis
statement
with
respect
to
the
section
in
question
that
the
prohibition
against
hot
cargo
agreement
does
not
apply
the
construction
industry
relating
to
work
to
be
done
at
the
site
of
the
construction.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
alright.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
--
the
contract
is
illegal
because
--
the
question
is
what
was
congress
attempting
to
prevent
here?
and
i
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
no,
i
think
probably
mr.
kennedy
made
the
most
enlightening
statement
on
that
--
on
--
to
all
of
those
points.
senator
morris
though
as
i
said
that
he's
rather
astute
fellow.
he
said
what
we
say
here
that
it's
just
one
of
those
things
that
a
union
can't
protect
its
people
under
a
contractor.
now
they
can
protect
them
on
work
that
is
being
performed
on
a
jobsite.
and
as
i
understand,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
construction
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
on
the
jobsite
are
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
some
of
this
work,
your
honor
can't
be
done
some
place
else.of
course,
you
appreciate
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does,
no
sir.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
long.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
work
to
be
done
at
the
jobsite,
that's
right.
it's
not
work
that
could
be
done
at
the
jobsite
your
honor,
and
that
--
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
well,
we
--
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
would
make
that
an
unlawful
provision.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
d.
deakins,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
intend
to
eliminate.
it
was
a
matter
of
--
there
are
things
such
as
technological
advantages
and
advancement
that
all
make
for
more
work
and
of
course,
we
don't
consider
those
things.
the
congress
does
when
they
speak
of
these
things
and
discuss
these.
of
course,
this
was
a
compromise
as
you
well
know.
and
i
think
my
time
is
about
running.
i
want
to
mention
briefly
case
number
413.
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
would
ever
reach
--
should
ever
reach
this
point
but
if
it
does,
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
court
below
has
reliance
on
denver
building
trades
council
where
it
said
that
when
local
13
