mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
threshold
we
have
what
is
really
a
substantial
evidence
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board's
finding
that
the
union
in
the
two
instances
were
induced
--
the
refusals
to
handle
the
thorpe
and
the
techalloy
products
had
only
a
work
preservation
object
to
whether
as
mr.
deakins
is
trying
to
suggest,
they
had
a
dual
object.
now
the
board
found
and
that
--
and
the
relevant
board
finding
is
on
page
201
of
the
record
that
upon
the
entire
record,
we
cannot
agree
with
the
general
counsel
that
the
respondent
locals
were
engaged
in
a
boycott
of
nonunion
products.
and
the
board
indicates
in
a
footnote
that
even
the
trial
examiner
so
found
even
though
he
went
on
to
find
the
violation
on
some
other
ground.
while
techalloy
and
thorpe
were
nonunion
employers,
either
local
22
and
on
local
113
had
ever
refused
to
apply
their
products
before
the
incidents
in
question.
it
did
so
only
in
the
two
instances
where
johns-manville
and
armstrong
had
the
products
prefabricated
thereby
depriving
the
armstrong
and
johns-manville
employees
of
work
that
they
would
otherwise
be
doing
so
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
there
are
two
products
involved.
there's
an
aluminum
band
that
would
be
fastened
around
insulation
material
to
hold
it
on
pipes.
now
cut
traditionally,
johns-manville
bought
this
aluminum
tubing
in
a
roll.
that
tubing
would
then
be
cut
into
bands
by
the
johns-manville
employees
in
the
johns-manville
shop
in
houston.
they
would
do
that
even
though
techalloy
from
whom
the
tubing
was
purchased
was
a
nonunion
employer.
what
would
happen
then
after
the
johns-manville
employee
in
the
shop
would
do
the
work,
he
would
put
a
label
which
is
like
a
posted
stamp
on
the
pipe.
and
that
label
would
have
a
serial
number
so
that
when
the
bands
arrived
at
the
jobsite,
the
johns-manville
employees
there
by
checking
with
the
union
business
agent
who
had
a
list
of
the
serial
numbers,
could
determine
whether
or
not
that
pipe
had
been
finished
in
--
had
been
finished
by
johns-manville
employees.
now
the
board
found
and
the
court
below
sustained
the
board
finding
that
this
label
or
decal,
although
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
union
label,
served
only
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
union,
local
22
being
the
principal
union
here
to
police
the
no
subcontracting
provision
of
the
contract
which
it
had
with
johns-manville
and
armstrong.
and
this,
no
subcontracting
provision
as
mr.
deakins
has
indicated,
flatly
barred
the
contracting
out
of
certain
specified
work
including
the
preparation
and
application
of
pipe
and
boiler
coverings.
and
the
record
shows
that
in
the
past
where
both
armstrong
and
thorpe
had
consistently
followed
the
practice
of
letting
the
johns-manville
and
armstrong
employees
do
the
finishing
work
on
the
tubing,
the
other
product
happened
to
be
insulation
covering
and
the
finishing
work
involved
was
this.
customarily,
armstrong
would
buy
that
in
links
and
its
shop
employees
would
miter
it.
in
other
words,
they
would
cut
some
of
it
at
angles
and
glue
it
together
so
that
it
could
fit
as
i
understand
over
the
corners
of
certain
--
of
the
pipes.
in
the
past
when
this
finishing
work
had
been
done
by
the
johns-manville
and
armstrong
employees,
the
union
had
shop
--
the
site
employees
of
johns-manville
and
armstrong
had
installed
these
products
even
though
as
i've
indicated,
thorpe
and
techalloy
were
nonunion
manufacturers
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
done
by
members
of
the
same
union
and
by
employees
of
the
same
employer,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
john
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
the
present
time,
it
was
not
done
at
the
site.
the
record
indicates
that
here
--
that
originally,
this
work
was
done
at
the
site.
however,
at
least
in
the
case
of
armstrong,
this
--
they
used
a
big
saw
for
the
mitering
and
they
found
that
more
convenient
to
have
that
saw
in
its
shop
in
houston
and
--
so
that
insofar
as
the
incidents
involved
in
this
case
are
concerned,
both
of
the
finishing
work
was
done
by
armstrong
or
johns-manville
employees
off
the
site
in
their
shops
in
houston.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
union
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
in
the
two
instances
and
there
were
only
two.
there
was
a
third
instance
where
--
involving
armstrong,
where
it
didn't
come
to
the
job
with
the
decal
but
the
union
on
checking
found
out
that
it
had
actually
been
finished
in
an
arm
--
in
armstrong
shop
and
when
it
got
a
letter
from
armstrong
saying
that
it
was
finished,
they
didn't
refuse
--
i
mean,
they
then
proceeded
to
install
it.
so
we're
talking
about
two
instances
over
a
long
period
in
time,
the
only
two
instances
in
which
armstrong
and
johns-manville
got
the
products
prefinished.
those
two
instances,
the
union
induced
johns-manville
and
armstrong
employees
on
the
job
not
to
handle
them
because
they
were
in
violation
of
the
no
subcontracting
provision
of
the
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
in
our
submission,
that
does
not
make
a
relevant
difference
as
i
will
attempt
to
show.
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
we
were
dependent
upon
a
proviso
to
8
(e)
for
the
legality
of
a
--
of
the
union's
action.
but
since
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
we
are
not
--
i
argue
with
it,
it
does
not
make
a
difference.
now,
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
which
i
have
just
sketched
in,
i
think
that
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board's
finding
which
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
even
the
finding
of
the
trial
examiner
even
though
he
found
a
violation
on
some
other
ground
that
the
unions
here
did
not
have
a
dual
object,
work
preservation,
and
hitting
the
product,
they
had
only
one
object,
namely,
work
preservation.
the
record
further
shows
that
they
installed
other
instances
prefab
products
that
were
nonunion.
other
cases,
they
refuse
to
install
them
even
if
they
were
a
union.
it
depended
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
depends,
your
honor
as
to
how
we
define
a
dual
object.
i
mean
there,
of
course,
i
mean
the
statute
says,
“an
object”.
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
hold
--
that
even
if
the
union
had
a
lawful
object
that
that
is
coupled
with
an
unlawful
one,
its
conduct
is
bad.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
also
this
problem
that
let
us
just
take
the
clearest
case
of
primary
activity
where
you
put
a
picket
line
up
in
front
of
a
primary
plant.
now
--
and
the
pickets
there
try
to
turn
away
suppliers
who
come
to
that
plant.
now,
in
a
sense,
you
might
say
that
they
have
an
object
there
of
forcing
a
cessation
of
business.
now
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you'd
--
would
however,
would
not
regard
that
kind
of
a
dual
object
as
a
violation
of
the
statute.
i
mean
the
--
it's
usually
referred
to
as
merely
an
incident
of
lawful
primary
activity.
so
that
i
think
really
what
you
have
--
basically,
what
you
have
to
decide
is
whether
you
got
here
a
conduct
that
is
essentially
a
lawful
primary
activity.
and
if
you're
satisfied
that
it
is,
then
any
effects
on
the
secondary
or
the
--
or
any
--
toward
a
cessation
of
business
is
regarded
either
as
an
incident
or
as
a
hope
or
an
expectation.
it
isn't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
a
primary,
it
would
not
be
an
unlawful
object.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
kind
of
situation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
i
would
call
that
an
incident.
the
court
of
appeals
called
it
a
hope
or
an
expectation.
i
think
that
you've
got
to
put
that
kind
of
loss
on
it
in
order
to
preserve
activity
that
you're
going
to
deem
to
be
legitimate
primary
activity.
otherwise,
you're
going
to
be
knocking
out
primary
strikes.
you're
going
to
be
--
i
think
putting
fiber
board
as
you
pointed
out
in
a
very,
very
small
ballpark
because
in
any
time
that
you
prohibit
subcontracting
for
example,
you
are
going
to
be
affecting
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
business
relations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
know.
that
would
look
to
me
to
be
more
secondary
than
--
because
there,
the
union
does
not
have
the
justification
that
it
has
in
this
case
of
really
protecting
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
working
conditions
of
the
employees
of
the
employer
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
probably
say
that
that
was
primary
because
there
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
i
think
i
do.
but
the
fact
remains
that
on
this
record,
i
submit,
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
it
any
differently
than
the
court
would
--
a
substantial
evidence
case
which
under
universal
camera
where
the
board's
findings
have
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
go
beyond
them.
because
i
think
that
i've
demonstrated
that
looking
at
this
record
as
a
whole,
there
is
ample
evidentiary
support
for
the
board's
finding
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
maybe
a
consequence
but
that
is
a
consequence
that
flows
from
a
lot
of
primary
activity.
and
if
you're
going
to
interpret
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
and
i
believe
that
the
proviso
that
you
referred
to
justice
white
that
was
added
in
5199
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
suppose
that
that
would
apply
though
even
in
where
you
had
purely
a
service
involved
in
your
band
subcontracting.
now,
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
the
point
that
the
position
that
my
opponent
is
arguing
for
and
that
mr.
mahin
has
argued
for
really
in
the
sense
stands
the
statute
on
its
--
well,
it
lead
--
at
the
least
leads
to
this
anomalous
result
that
certain
unions
in
particularly
those
in
the
service
industries
would
be
able
to
protect
against
the
loss
of
work
that
they
have
traditionally
performed.
of
course,
the
most
common
example
of
that
is
the
teamsters
who
were
involved
in
that
kind
of
thing
whereas
other
unions
like
those
in
the
construction
trades
here,
who
when
they
lose
work,
it
ends
up
in
a
product
are
powerless
to
protect
themselves
against
it.
now
it
may
be
that
the
social
cost
of
that
is
so
great
that
congress
might
in
time
want
to
do
something
about
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
representative
alger
in
5199
had
a
bill.
in
there,
they
would
have
just
made
it
unlawful
to
keep
prefabricated
products
out
of
the
area
which
of
course
was
not
adopted.
but
the
point
is
--
the
point
that
we're
making
is
that
this
statute
8
--
that
--
and
that
congress
neither
in
1947
nor
in
1959,
undertook
to
resolve
that
problem
into
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
or
the
hot
cargo
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
is
obvious
and
one
that
this
court
alluded
to
in
the
sand
door
case.
namely,
that
the
history
of
this
labor
legislation
particularly
when
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
picketing
and
what
are
the
permissible
economic
weapons
that
a
union
can
use
and
then
you
add
to
that
effect
that
what's
involved
is
jobs
and
loss
of
work
generated
so
much
heat
from
the
contending
enforcers
that
congress
went
very,
very
slowly.
and
therefore,
it
cautions
against
attributing
to
congress
more
than
the
clearest
evidence
that
it
has
given.
and
the
legislative
history
particularly
of
the
‘59
amendments
indicates
that
the
thing
that
they
were
after
in
enacting
8
(e)
was
the
hot
cargo
agreement.
now
what
they
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
they
were
not
just
after
the
teamsters
union
although
the
teamsters
union
was
the
impetus
for
it.
but
it
--
the
history
is
this.
the
senate
bill,
one
that
emerged
from
the
senate
committee,
had
no
provision.
on
the
floor
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
1959,
i'm
talking
about
1959.
mr.
norton
j.
come
senator
gore
on
the
floor
added
on
8
(e)
limited
to
the
trucking
industry.
and
it
was
the
teamsters
that
were
used
as
the
example.
senator
kennedy
acknowledged
that
that
problem
needed
to
be
taken
care
of
and
he
went
for
it.
he
accepted
the
amendment.
and
the
senate
bill
was
amended
on
the
floor
to
give
you
an
8
(e)
provision
limited
to
carriers
under
the
regulation
of
the
icc,
i
mean
the
motor
carriers.
in
the
house,
the
landrum
and
griffin,
and
of
course,
senator
goldwater
in
the
senate
thought
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
just
cover
hot
cargo
agreements
and
they
keep
using
this
term
over
and
over
again
and
senator
goldwater
defines
it
as
mr.
manoli
defined
it
in
the
classic
sense
where
you're
refusing
to
handle
the
products
of
some
other
person
who
you
have
a
dispute
with
or
you've
labeled
as
unfair.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
i
might
say
that
that
was
the
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
general
millwork
case
which
i
believe
i
argued.
the
union
ruled
in
that
case
was
similar
to
the
one
in
sand
door.
i
mean
what
it
said
was
that
only
products
made
in
factory
shops
or
mills
were
members
of
the
united
brotherhood
where
carpenters
are
employed
shall
be
installed
by
fellow
members.
i
mean
that's
the
kind
of
an
animal
that
we
were
dealing
with
in
sand
door
and
in
the
brotherhood
case.
well,
i
realized
i
my
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
when
we
adjourned
for
lunch,
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
legislative
history
of
8
(e)
shows
that
it
was
directed
at
a
particular
evil
namely
the
hot
cargo
agreement
or
rather
similar
agreements
that
were
secondary
in
objective.
the
senate
bill
band
it
on
the
--
band
the
hot
cargo
agreement
only
with
respect
to
the
trucking
industry
in
the
house.
it
was
extended
to
all
industries
because
the
point
was
made
that
there
were
other
industries
besides
trucking
where
there
were
these
hot
cargo
agreements.
but
every
time
the
emphasis
was
on
hot
cargo
agreement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
i
don't
mean
it
in
the
literal
sense.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
mean
a
situation
where
you
were
refusing
to
handle
goods
because
you
had
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer
who
produced
them
or
otherwise
disfavored
them.
now
a
subcontracting
clause,
a
clause
which
prohibits
the
subcontracting
of
work
with
the
bargaining
unit,
historically
and
analytically
is
far
different
from
the
hot
cargo
clause
because
its
thrust
is
not
the
labor
conditions
of
some
other
employer
but
it
is
an
effort
to
protect
the
--
in
an
immediate
sense
not
in
the
vague
sense
that
any
union
organizational
effort
or
a
secondary
boycott
tends
to
preserve
organizational
goals
of
the
union.
but
in
an
immediate
sense,
the
working
conditions
that
the
employer
and
the
union
have
bargained
for
with
respect
to
the
work
unit
that
is
principally
involved.
there
was
no
persuasive
indication
that
congress
intended
by
this
band
in
8
(e)
to
reach
that
sort
of
an
agreement.
now
to
be
sure,
you
have
some
expressions
of
fear
by
senator
morris
and
by
representative
thompson
and
even
senator
kennedy
at
the
time
the
landrum-griffin
bill
was
in
the
conference
that
the
8
(e)
provision
was
so
broad
that
it
could
also
interdict
the
subcontracting
clauses.but
senator
morris,
first
of
all,
was
an
opponent
of
the
legislation
even
after
it
emerged
from
the
conference
and
his
views
should
be
discounted
for
that
reason.
secondly,
senator
kennedy
and
representative
thompson
were
talking
about
the
bill
which
at
the
time
it
went
to
the
conference
did
not
have
any
proviso
of
protecting
primary
activity.
what
had
happened
was
that
in
an
effort
to
cure
the
loophole,
some
of
the
loopholes
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
landrum-griffin
bill
had
not
knocked
out
the
word
concerted
in
the
old
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
and
that
was
the
thing
that
this
court
in
rice
milling
had
hanged
its
head
on
in
finding
that
there
was
an
exception
for
primary
activity.
and
they
were
fearful
that
would
--
that
eliminated
and
without
any
express
recognition
of
a
reservation
for
primary
activity.
if
you
put
that
together,
you'd
end
up
with
a
sweeping
provision
that
covered
even
primary
activity.
once
the
bill
emerged
from
conference
with
that
primary
activity
proviso
on
it,
there
was
no
more
expressions
of
such
fears
from
senator
kennedy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
no,
i
want
to
talk
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
want
to
talk
about
the
8
(e)
proviso.
and
i
was
talking
about
the
8
(b)
--
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
that
says
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
to
interdict
the
primary
strike
or
primary
picketing
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
general
electric
case
and
in
carrier.
now,
under
my
interpretation
then,
namely,
that
this
prior
work
preservation
clauses
or
i
see
my
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
what
room
is
there
left
for
the
proviso
to
8
(e)
which
attempts
to
preserve
onsite
work
in
the
construction
industry.
it's
our
position
that
what
congress
was
aiming
at
there
was
to
preserve
for
the
construction
industry
certain
agreements
that
were
secondary
in
nature.
the
most
common
form
is
the
kind
that
you
had
in
the
denver
building
trades
case
where
the
general
contractor
enters
into
the
union,
a
contract
that
he
shall
employ
only
the
union
subcontractors
on
the
job.
now,
that
agreement
is
a
secondary
agreement
because
the
--
that
this
court
held
in
denver
that
the
subs
are
independent
entities.
and
now,
under
8
(e)
without
the
proviso,
that
kind
of
an
agreement
would
be
illegal
in
the
construction
industry.
originally,
they
wanted
to
go
further
and
permit
not
only
that
kind
of
an
agreement,
but
a
strike
to
enforce
it,
in
other
words,
completely
overruled
denver
building.
they
weren't
able
to
get
that.
they
drew
the
line
at
continuing
to
permit
the
agreement
of
the
illegal
but
not
let
the
construction
industry
enforce
it
by
strike
pressure.
and
the
significance
of
limiting
it
to
onsite
work
is
that
they
didn't
want
to
permit
the
construction
industry,
however,
to
use
that
proviso
for
the
purpose
of
unionizing
suppliers
who
happen
to
deliver
stuff
to
the
jobsite.
and
--
but
that
is
not
this
case
because
this
product
here
or
“these
products”
if
you
may
call
them
as
such,
were
not
disfavored
for
that
reason.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
union
handled
them
when
the
finishing
work
was
left
for
their
shop
employees
to
perform.
now,
there's
another
issue
in
the
case
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
deal
with
for
the
reasons
that
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
on
that,
a
part
of
the
case
we
submit
that
the
court
here
in
finding
that
the
activity
by
the
sister
union
was
secondary
since
it
was
confined
to
the
primary
employer
who
was
not
a
neutral,
that
activity
was
likewise
primary
activity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
threshold
we
have
what
is
really
a
substantial
evidence
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board's
finding
that
the
union
in
the
two
instances
were
induced
--
the
refusals
to
handle
the
thorpe
and
the
techalloy
products
had
only
a
work
preservation
object
to
whether
as
mr.
deakins
is
trying
to
suggest,
they
had
a
dual
object.
now
the
board
found
and
that
--
and
the
relevant
board
finding
is
on
page
201
of
the
record
that
upon
the
entire
record,
we
cannot
agree
with
the
general
counsel
that
the
respondent
locals
were
engaged
in
a
boycott
of
nonunion
products.
and
the
board
indicates
in
a
footnote
that
even
the
trial
examiner
so
found
even
though
he
went
on
to
find
the
violation
on
some
other
ground.
while
techalloy
and
thorpe
were
nonunion
employers,
either
local
22
and
on
local
113
had
ever
refused
to
apply
their
products
before
the
incidents
in
question.
it
did
so
only
in
the
two
instances
where
johns-manville
and
armstrong
had
the
products
prefabricated
thereby
depriving
the
armstrong
and
johns-manville
employees
of
work
that
they
would
otherwise
be
doing
so
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
there
are
two
products
involved.
there's
an
aluminum
band
that
would
be
fastened
around
insulation
material
to
hold
it
on
pipes.
now
cut
traditionally,
johns-manville
bought
this
aluminum
tubing
in
a
roll.
that
tubing
would
then
be
cut
into
bands
by
the
johns-manville
employees
in
the
johns-manville
shop
in
houston.
they
would
do
that
even
though
techalloy
from
whom
the
tubing
was
purchased
was
a
nonunion
employer.
what
would
happen
then
after
the
johns-manville
employee
in
the
shop
would
do
the
work,
he
would
put
a
label
which
is
like
a
posted
stamp
on
the
pipe.
and
that
label
would
have
a
serial
number
so
that
when
the
bands
arrived
at
the
jobsite,
the
johns-manville
employees
there
by
checking
with
the
union
business
agent
who
had
a
list
of
the
serial
numbers,
could
determine
whether
or
not
that
pipe
had
been
finished
in
--
had
been
finished
by
johns-manville
employees.
now
the
board
found
and
the
court
below
sustained
the
board
finding
that
this
label
or
decal,
although
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
union
label,
served
only
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
union,
local
22
being
the
principal
union
here
to
police
the
no
subcontracting
provision
of
the
contract
which
it
had
with
johns-manville
and
armstrong.
and
this,
no
subcontracting
provision
as
mr.
deakins
has
indicated,
flatly
barred
the
contracting
out
of
certain
specified
work
including
the
preparation
and
application
of
pipe
and
boiler
coverings.
and
the
record
shows
that
in
the
past
where
both
armstrong
and
thorpe
had
consistently
followed
the
practice
of
letting
the
johns-manville
and
armstrong
employees
do
the
finishing
work
on
the
tubing,
the
other
product
happened
to
be
insulation
covering
and
the
finishing
work
involved
was
this.
customarily,
armstrong
would
buy
that
in
links
and
its
shop
employees
would
miter
it.
in
other
words,
they
would
cut
some
of
it
at
angles
and
glue
it
together
so
that
it
could
fit
as
i
understand
over
the
corners
of
certain
--
of
the
pipes.
in
the
past
when
this
finishing
work
had
been
done
by
the
johns-manville
and
armstrong
employees,
the
union
had
shop
--
the
site
employees
of
johns-manville
and
armstrong
had
installed
these
products
even
though
as
i've
indicated,
thorpe
and
techalloy
were
nonunion
manufacturers
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
done
by
members
of
the
same
union
and
by
employees
of
the
same
employer,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
john
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
the
present
time,
it
was
not
done
at
the
site.
the
record
indicates
that
here
--
that
originally,
this
work
was
done
at
the
site.
however,
at
least
in
the
case
of
armstrong,
this
--
they
used
a
big
saw
for
the
mitering
and
they
found
that
more
convenient
to
have
that
saw
in
its
shop
in
houston
and
--
so
that
insofar
as
the
incidents
involved
in
this
case
are
concerned,
both
of
the
finishing
work
was
done
by
armstrong
or
johns-manville
employees
off
the
site
in
their
shops
in
houston.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
union
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
in
the
two
instances
and
there
were
only
two.
there
was
a
third
instance
where
--
involving
armstrong,
where
it
didn't
come
to
the
job
with
the
decal
but
the
union
on
checking
found
out
that
it
had
actually
been
finished
in
an
arm
--
in
armstrong
shop
and
when
it
got
a
letter
from
armstrong
saying
that
it
was
finished,
they
didn't
refuse
--
i
mean,
they
then
proceeded
to
install
it.
so
we're
talking
about
two
instances
over
a
long
period
in
time,
the
only
two
instances
in
which
armstrong
and
johns-manville
got
the
products
prefinished.
those
two
instances,
the
union
induced
johns-manville
and
armstrong
employees
on
the
job
not
to
handle
them
because
they
were
in
violation
of
the
no
subcontracting
provision
of
the
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
in
our
submission,
that
does
not
make
a
relevant
difference
as
i
will
attempt
to
show.
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
we
were
dependent
upon
a
proviso
to
8
(e)
for
the
legality
of
a
--
of
the
union's
action.
but
since
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
we
are
not
--
i
argue
with
it,
it
does
not
make
a
difference.
now,
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
which
i
have
just
sketched
in,
i
think
that
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board's
finding
which
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
even
the
finding
of
the
trial
examiner
even
though
he
found
a
violation
on
some
other
ground
that
the
unions
here
did
not
have
a
dual
object,
work
preservation,
and
hitting
the
product,
they
had
only
one
object,
namely,
work
preservation.
the
record
further
shows
that
they
installed
other
instances
prefab
products
that
were
nonunion.
other
cases,
they
refuse
to
install
them
even
if
they
were
a
union.
it
depended
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
depends,
your
honor
as
to
how
we
define
a
dual
object.
i
mean
there,
of
course,
i
mean
the
statute
says,
“an
object”.
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
hold
--
that
even
if
the
union
had
a
lawful
object
that
that
is
coupled
with
an
unlawful
one,
its
conduct
is
bad.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
also
this
problem
that
let
us
just
take
the
clearest
case
of
primary
activity
where
you
put
a
picket
line
up
in
front
of
a
primary
plant.
now
--
and
the
pickets
there
try
to
turn
away
suppliers
who
come
to
that
plant.
now,
in
a
sense,
you
might
say
that
they
have
an
object
there
of
forcing
a
cessation
of
business.
now
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you'd
--
would
however,
would
not
regard
that
kind
of
a
dual
object
as
a
violation
of
the
statute.
i
mean
the
--
it's
usually
referred
to
as
merely
an
incident
of
lawful
primary
activity.
so
that
i
think
really
what
you
have
--
basically,
what
you
have
to
decide
is
whether
you
got
here
a
conduct
that
is
essentially
a
lawful
primary
activity.
and
if
you're
satisfied
that
it
is,
then
any
effects
on
the
secondary
or
the
--
or
any
--
toward
a
cessation
of
business
is
regarded
either
as
an
incident
or
as
a
hope
or
an
expectation.
it
isn't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
a
primary,
it
would
not
be
an
unlawful
object.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
kind
of
situation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
i
would
call
that
an
incident.
the
court
of
appeals
called
it
a
hope
or
an
expectation.
i
think
that
you've
got
to
put
that
kind
of
loss
on
it
in
order
to
preserve
activity
that
you're
going
to
deem
to
be
legitimate
primary
activity.
otherwise,
you're
going
to
be
knocking
out
primary
strikes.
you're
going
to
be
--
i
think
putting
fiber
board
as
you
pointed
out
in
a
very,
very
small
ballpark
because
in
any
time
that
you
prohibit
subcontracting
for
example,
you
are
going
to
be
affecting
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
business
relations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
know.
that
would
look
to
me
to
be
more
secondary
than
--
because
there,
the
union
does
not
have
the
justification
that
it
has
in
this
case
of
really
protecting
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
the
working
conditions
of
the
employees
of
the
employer
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
probably
say
that
that
was
primary
because
there
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
i
think
i
do.
but
the
fact
remains
that
on
this
record,
i
submit,
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
it
any
differently
than
the
court
would
--
a
substantial
evidence
case
which
under
universal
camera
where
the
board's
findings
have
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
go
beyond
them.
because
i
think
that
i've
demonstrated
that
looking
at
this
record
as
a
whole,
there
is
ample
evidentiary
support
for
the
board's
finding
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
maybe
a
consequence
but
that
is
a
consequence
that
flows
from
a
lot
of
primary
activity.
and
if
you're
going
to
interpret
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
and
i
believe
that
the
proviso
that
you
referred
to
justice
white
that
was
added
in
5199
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
suppose
that
that
would
apply
though
even
in
where
you
had
purely
a
service
involved
in
your
band
subcontracting.
now,
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
the
point
that
the
position
that
my
opponent
is
arguing
for
and
that
mr.
mahin
has
argued
for
really
in
the
sense
stands
the
statute
on
its
--
well,
it
lead
--
at
the
least
leads
to
this
anomalous
result
that
certain
unions
in
particularly
those
in
the
service
industries
would
be
able
to
protect
against
the
loss
of
work
that
they
have
traditionally
performed.
of
course,
the
most
common
example
of
that
is
the
teamsters
who
were
involved
in
that
kind
of
thing
whereas
other
unions
like
those
in
the
construction
trades
here,
who
when
they
lose
work,
it
ends
up
in
a
product
are
powerless
to
protect
themselves
against
it.
now
it
may
be
that
the
social
cost
of
that
is
so
great
that
congress
might
in
time
want
to
do
something
about
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
representative
alger
in
5199
had
a
bill.
in
there,
they
would
have
just
made
it
unlawful
to
keep
prefabricated
products
out
of
the
area
which
of
course
was
not
adopted.
but
the
point
is
--
the
point
that
we're
making
is
that
this
statute
8
--
that
--
and
that
congress
neither
in
1947
nor
in
1959,
undertook
to
resolve
that
problem
into
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
or
the
hot
cargo
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
is
obvious
and
one
that
this
court
alluded
to
in
the
sand
door
case.
namely,
that
the
history
of
this
labor
legislation
particularly
when
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
picketing
and
what
are
the
permissible
economic
weapons
that
a
union
can
use
and
then
you
add
to
that
effect
that
what's
involved
is
jobs
and
loss
of
work
generated
so
much
heat
from
the
contending
enforcers
that
congress
went
very,
very
slowly.
and
therefore,
it
cautions
against
attributing
to
congress
more
than
the
clearest
evidence
that
it
has
given.
and
the
legislative
history
particularly
of
the
‘59
amendments
indicates
that
the
thing
that
they
were
after
in
enacting
8
(e)
was
the
hot
cargo
agreement.
now
what
they
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
they
were
not
just
after
the
teamsters
union
although
the
teamsters
union
was
the
impetus
for
it.
but
it
--
the
history
is
this.
the
senate
bill,
one
that
emerged
from
the
senate
committee,
had
no
provision.
on
the
floor
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
1959,
i'm
talking
about
1959.
mr.
norton
j.
come
senator
gore
on
the
floor
added
on
8
(e)
limited
to
the
trucking
industry.
and
it
was
the
teamsters
that
were
used
as
the
example.
senator
kennedy
acknowledged
that
that
problem
needed
to
be
taken
care
of
and
he
went
for
it.
he
accepted
the
amendment.
and
the
senate
bill
was
amended
on
the
floor
to
give
you
an
8
(e)
provision
limited
to
carriers
under
the
regulation
of
the
icc,
i
mean
the
motor
carriers.
in
the
house,
the
landrum
and
griffin,
and
of
course,
senator
goldwater
in
the
senate
thought
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
just
cover
hot
cargo
agreements
and
they
keep
using
this
term
over
and
over
again
and
senator
goldwater
defines
it
as
mr.
manoli
defined
it
in
the
classic
sense
where
you're
refusing
to
handle
the
products
of
some
other
person
who
you
have
a
dispute
with
or
you've
labeled
as
unfair.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
i
might
say
that
that
was
the
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
general
millwork
case
which
i
believe
i
argued.
the
union
ruled
in
that
case
was
similar
to
the
one
in
sand
door.
i
mean
what
it
said
was
that
only
products
made
in
factory
shops
or
mills
were
members
of
the
united
brotherhood
where
carpenters
are
employed
shall
be
installed
by
fellow
members.
i
mean
that's
the
kind
of
an
animal
that
we
were
dealing
with
in
sand
door
and
in
the
brotherhood
case.
well,
i
realized
i
my
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
when
we
adjourned
for
lunch,
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
legislative
history
of
8
(e)
shows
that
it
was
directed
at
a
particular
evil
namely
the
hot
cargo
agreement
or
rather
similar
agreements
that
were
secondary
in
objective.
the
senate
bill
band
it
on
the
--
band
the
hot
cargo
agreement
only
with
respect
to
the
trucking
industry
in
the
house.
it
was
extended
to
all
industries
because
the
point
was
made
that
there
were
other
industries
besides
trucking
where
there
were
these
hot
cargo
agreements.
but
every
time
the
emphasis
was
on
hot
cargo
agreement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
i
don't
mean
it
in
the
literal
sense.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
mean
a
situation
where
you
were
refusing
to
handle
goods
because
you
had
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer
who
produced
them
or
otherwise
disfavored
them.
now
a
subcontracting
clause,
a
clause
which
prohibits
the
subcontracting
of
work
with
the
bargaining
unit,
historically
and
analytically
is
far
different
from
the
hot
cargo
clause
because
its
thrust
is
not
the
labor
conditions
of
some
other
employer
but
it
is
an
effort
to
protect
the
--
in
an
immediate
sense
not
in
the
vague
sense
that
any
union
organizational
effort
or
a
secondary
boycott
tends
to
preserve
organizational
goals
of
the
union.
but
in
an
immediate
sense,
the
working
conditions
that
the
employer
and
the
union
have
bargained
for
with
respect
to
the
work
unit
that
is
principally
involved.
there
was
no
persuasive
indication
that
congress
intended
by
this
band
in
8
(e)
to
reach
that
sort
of
an
agreement.
now
to
be
sure,
you
have
some
expressions
of
fear
by
senator
morris
and
by
representative
thompson
and
even
senator
kennedy
at
the
time
the
landrum-griffin
bill
was
in
the
conference
that
the
8
(e)
provision
was
so
broad
that
it
could
also
interdict
the
subcontracting
clauses.but
senator
morris,
first
of
all,
was
an
opponent
of
the
legislation
even
after
it
emerged
from
the
conference
and
his
views
should
be
discounted
for
that
reason.
secondly,
senator
kennedy
and
representative
thompson
were
talking
about
the
bill
which
at
the
time
it
went
to
the
conference
did
not
have
any
proviso
of
protecting
primary
activity.
what
had
happened
was
that
in
an
effort
to
cure
the
loophole,
some
of
the
loopholes
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
landrum-griffin
bill
had
not
knocked
out
the
word
concerted
in
the
old
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
and
that
was
the
thing
that
this
court
in
rice
milling
had
hanged
its
head
on
in
finding
that
there
was
an
exception
for
primary
activity.
and
they
were
fearful
that
would
--
that
eliminated
and
without
any
express
recognition
of
a
reservation
for
primary
activity.
if
you
put
that
together,
you'd
end
up
with
a
sweeping
provision
that
covered
even
primary
activity.
once
the
bill
emerged
from
conference
with
that
primary
activity
proviso
on
it,
there
was
no
more
expressions
of
such
fears
from
senator
kennedy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
no,
i
want
to
talk
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
want
to
talk
about
the
8
(e)
proviso.
and
i
was
talking
about
the
8
(b)
--
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
that
says
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
to
interdict
the
primary
strike
or
primary
picketing
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
general
electric
case
and
in
carrier.
now,
under
my
interpretation
then,
namely,
that
this
prior
work
preservation
clauses
or
i
see
my
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
what
room
is
there
left
for
the
proviso
to
8
(e)
which
attempts
to
preserve
onsite
work
in
the
construction
industry.
it's
our
position
that
what
congress
was
aiming
at
there
was
to
preserve
for
the
construction
industry
certain
agreements
that
were
secondary
in
nature.
the
most
common
form
is
the
kind
that
you
had
in
the
denver
building
trades
case
where
the
general
contractor
enters
into
the
union,
a
contract
that
he
shall
employ
only
the
union
subcontractors
on
the
job.
now,
that
agreement
is
a
secondary
agreement
because
the
--
that
this
court
held
in
denver
that
the
subs
are
independent
entities.
and
now,
under
8
(e)
without
the
proviso,
that
kind
of
an
agreement
would
be
illegal
in
the
construction
industry.
originally,
they
wanted
to
go
further
and
permit
not
only
that
kind
of
an
agreement,
but
a
strike
to
enforce
it,
in
other
words,
completely
overruled
denver
building.
they
weren't
able
to
get
that.
they
drew
the
line
at
continuing
to
permit
the
agreement
of
the
illegal
but
not
let
the
construction
industry
enforce
it
by
strike
pressure.
and
the
significance
of
limiting
it
to
onsite
work
is
that
they
didn't
want
to
permit
the
construction
industry,
however,
to
use
that
proviso
for
the
purpose
of
unionizing
suppliers
who
happen
to
deliver
stuff
to
the
jobsite.
and
--
but
that
is
not
this
case
because
this
product
here
or
“these
products”
if
you
may
call
them
as
such,
were
not
disfavored
for
that
reason.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
union
handled
them
when
the
finishing
work
was
left
for
their
shop
employees
to
perform.
now,
there's
another
issue
in
the
case
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
deal
with
for
the
reasons
that
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
on
that,
a
part
of
the
case
we
submit
that
the
court
here
in
finding
that
the
activity
by
the
sister
union
was
secondary
since
it
was
confined
to
the
primary
employer
who
was
not
a
neutral,
that
activity
was
likewise
primary
activity.
