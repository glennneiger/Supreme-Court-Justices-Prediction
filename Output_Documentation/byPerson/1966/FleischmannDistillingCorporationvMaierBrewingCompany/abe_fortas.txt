justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
--
you're
not
arguing,
are
you,
that
the
lanham
act
authorizes
attorney's
fees
in
any
case?
justice
abe
fortas
you
do
argue
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you
argue
that
if
the
lanham
act
does
not
authorize
that
the
court
nevertheless
has
equity
power.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
relying,
--
so
far
as
your
lanham
act
argument
is
concerned,
are
you
relying
on
section
35
or
are
you
relying
on
any
specific
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
language
of
the
lanham
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
saying
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it's
implicit
in
the
lanham
act
or
if
it's
not
implicit
in
the
lanham
act,
then
the
power
resides
in
the
courts
of
general
equity
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
--
excuse
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
--
i
--
this
is
important
point
to
me.
are
you
saying
that
these
specific
words
in
the
lanham
act,
the
course
of
the
action
support
your
request
for
attorney's
fees?
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
then
you
are
relying
on
the
system
as
therapies?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
your
position
that
this
power
exists
with
respect
to
trademark
infringement
cases
but
not
for
example
with
respect
to
unfair
competition
kind
of
like
other
than
by
trademark?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
about
any
other
kind
of
tort,
how
about
business
secrets
torn
or
whatever?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
what
is
your
--
what's
the
position
you're
urging
on
us
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
something
--
something
special
about
handling
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lasky,
perhaps
i
--
i
seem
to
having
difficulty
in
getting
my
question
to
you.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
there
is
something
peculiar
about
trademark
cases
and
that
there
ought
to
be
in
trademark
cases
and
circumstances
where
you
have
willfulness
and
all
these
other
elements
that
you're
talking
about?
that
in
trademark
cases,
as
distinguished
from
other
types
of
equity
cases
or
the
law
cases,
there
ought
to
be
a
rule
permitting
the
trial
court
to
award
attorney's
fees?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
now
why
--
what
is
there
about
the
trademark
cases
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
distinguishes
it?
justice
abe
fortas
except,
you're
really
suggesting
it
seems
to
me
that
the
criterion
for
attorney's
fees
or
one
of
the
criteria
should
be
a
kind
of
a
punitive
damage
consideration?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
that
--
that's
measuring
it.
but
the
factors
that
give
rise
to
attorney's
fees
as
you
say,
i
don't
know
if
i'm
correct
in
understanding,
it
sounds
to
me
very
much
like
the
fact
doesn't
or
give
rise
to
a
claim
of
punitive
damages
and
say
willfulness
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
--
you're
not
arguing,
are
you,
that
the
lanham

in

justice

fortas
and
then
you
argue
that
if
the
lanham

does
not
authorize
that
the
court
nevertheless
has
equity
power.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
relying,
--
so
far
as
your
lanham

argument
is

are
you

or
are

specific
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
language
of

justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
saying
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it's
implicit
in
the

or
if
it's
not
