when

lanham
act
was

did
the
report
say
anything
about
lawyer's
fees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
anything
said
about
lawyer's
fees
in
the
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
hearing,
the
legislative
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
word?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
does
the
congress
had
wanted
to
give
attorney's
fee
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
number
of
other
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
quite
frankly,
i
have
to
test
it
if
i
see
it,
but
i
think
you
give
a
little
too
much
omniscious
to
pertinent
committee
when
you
think
that
they
would
have
understood
from
the
cryptic
words
of
equity
that
that
meant
they
were
going
to
get
lawyer's
fees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
committee
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
committee
of
lawyers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
lawyers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
they
suggested
that
they
get
lawyers
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
a
question
of
lawyer's
fees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
pretty
good
way
to
get
it,
wouldn't
it?
likely,
it's
pretty
liberal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
five
more
minutes.
justice
hugo
l.

that's
all.
justice
hugo

alright.
justice

mr.

justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
the
statement
of
your
understanding
of
what
can
be
assessed
against
a
defendant
in
the
lanham
act
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
--
in
other
words
all
the
profits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
act
itself
provides
that
a
defendant
can
be
held
out
also
three
times
the
amount
of
the
damages
he
suffered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
accounting
which
was
inclusive
to
cover
for
damages
and
so
on?
justice

black
that
accounting
has
not
been
held?
justice
hugo

black
but
there
has
been
no
accounting?
justice

how
did
it

how
was
it
subject

appeal?
