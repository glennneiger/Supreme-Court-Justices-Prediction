j.

so
you
mean
whether
fund
from
which
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
sprague
--
sprague
is
the
funding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lasky,
do
you
bring
this
within
any
of
those
three
as
example
cause
of
action
or
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
independently
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
it
ordinarily?
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
in
england
of
course,
but
does
it
in
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
--
in
the
united
states,
generally
do
we
get
that,
that's
the
cost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
--
except
with
those,
because
that
really
was
in
the
context
of
the
fund,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
is
ordinarily
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
subject
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
were
all
five
circuit
court
cases
think
i
haven't
read
them,
that
you
cite
are
--
they
were
--
this
has
been
sustained?
are
they
all
lanham
act
cases
or
are
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first,
second,
third,
and
seventh?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
all
of
these
are
in
the
lanham
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
result
on
the
merits
here,
mr.
hutchinson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
i
understand
your
point.
on
the
original
judgment
of
the
district
court,
there
would
have
been
no
attorney's
fees,
weren't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
your
clients
prevailed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then,
there
was
an
injunction
mandated
that
held
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
then
brought
on
one
motion
to
assess
attorney's
fees
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
based
it
on
the
merits
but
what
--
in
other
words,
the
$60,000
counsel
fee
allowed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
is
it
--
how
was
that
it
arrived
--
arrived
at?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
there
was
a
hearing
on
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
doubt,
didn't
it
--
didn't
that
opinion
deal
with
this
subject
anyway.
i
think
as
aladdin
suggested
too
in
terms
of
a
form
of
compensation
that
the
violation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
was
something
in
the
antitrust
law
has
provided
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
you
mean
whether
fund
from
which
the

justice
william
j.

yes.
justice
william
j.
