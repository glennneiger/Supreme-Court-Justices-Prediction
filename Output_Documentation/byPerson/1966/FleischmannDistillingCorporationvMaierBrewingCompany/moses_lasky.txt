mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
nearly
nine
years
ago
that
the
makers
and
american
distributors
of
the
famous
‘black
&
white'
whiskey
sought
to
have
the
respondents
discontinue
an
infringement
of
the
‘black
&
white'
label
on
alcoholic
beverages.
as
the
district
court
has
said
in
the
record,
“we
used
every
reasonable
effort
to
obtain
some
reasonable
accord
about
that
without
bringing
a
suit.
but
we
were
defied.”
the
suit
was
brought
for
trademark
infringement.
and
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
about
three
years
ago
to
which
this
court
then
denied
review
in
1963,
we
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
respondents
pirating
the
‘black
&
white'
trademark
on
alcoholic
beverages.
upon
concurrent
findings
of
both
courts
below,
it
is
the
law
of
this
case
that
the
respondents'
conduct
was
not
only
an
infringement
but
that
it
was
willful,
fraudulent,
and
bad
faith.
and
that
the
only
rational
explanation
of
respondents'
conduct
in
adopting
the
name
‘black
&
white'
in
the
first
place
and
then
in
persistently
defying
the
petitioners
when
asked
to
cease
and
even
of
carrying
the
case
or
attempting
to
carry
it
up
to
this
court
was
that
they
were
trying
to
trade
on
the
real
‘black
&
white's
goodwill,
in
other
words
if
this
was
a
case
of
a
careless
and
recalcitrant
attitude,
a
willful
and
persistent
defiance.
now,
if
the
court
please,
for
years,
it
has
been
accepted
indeed
as
harmful
blow
that
in
trademark
infringement
suits
in
the
federal
courts
in
equity,
federal
courts
have
the
power
in
appropriate
and
proper
circumstances
to
assess
against
the
infringing
defendants,
the
litigation
expenses
including
attorney's
fees
which
their
conduct
has
imposed
upon
the
plaintiff.
the
circumstance
on
which
that
power
could
be
and
should
be
exercised
has
been
variously
expressed.
but
i
think
they
can
all
be
summed
up
in
terms
of
willful
conduct
--
willful
misconduct
where
the
infringer
has
acted
knowingly
and
with
deliberate
purpose
to
fill
the
goodwill
of
the
trademark
owner
and
in
persistent
defiance
of
the
owner's
rights.
now,
until
this
case
now
before
the
court
came
to
the
court
below,
every
federal
court
of
appeals
had
to
dealt
with
this
matter,
every
--
at
least
every
court
of
appeals
in
which
there
is
any
report
of
the
matter,
and
numerous
district
courts
have
upheld
the
power.
and
it
has
been
repeatedly
been
exercised
below
and
above
where
awards
of
fees
have
been
affirmed
and
additional
awards
have
been
granted.
our
briefs
cites
to
the
court
decisions
of
the
first,
second,
third
and
seventh
circuits
in
trademark
cases
indeed
from
the
first
--
from
the
second
circuit,
a
decision
on
which
this
court
denied
review
just
last
term.
we
cite
decisions
on
unfair
competition
cases
from
the
sixth
and
the
seventh
circuit.
and
one
from
the
second
circuit
handed
down
just
two
months
ago,
a
week
or
two
after
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
was
filed
in
this
court
where
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
was
justified
by
the
court
because
defendant's
conduct
was
described
as
intentional,
vexatious,
and
fraudulent.
we
cited
decisions
from
the
fourth
circuit
which
relies
on
these
very
trademark
decisions.
and
until
this
case,
that
had
also
been
the
settled
law
in
the
whole
series
of
decisions
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there
were
no
cases
to
the
contrary.
and
so
after
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
several
years
ago,
we
applied
to
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment
accordingly
and
we
got
our
injunction
against
infringement.
and
proceeding
upon
this
solid
and
unanimous
chain
of
authority,
the
district
court
then
appraised
the
circumstances
and
determined
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
and
its
appraisal
of
the
facts
that
an
award
of
fees
and
litigation
expenses
should
be
made
and
an
award
was
entered.
an
interlocutory
appeal
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit,
from
that
order
it
allowed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
overruled
its
prior
decisions.
in
so
many
words,
it
said
they
were
bad
law.
and
it
looked
at
the
decisions
from
the
other
courts
of
appeals.
and
it
said
as
to
them,
they
are
not
well
considered.
it
said
it
would
not
follow
them
and
its
conclusion
was
this,
“we
hold
that
attorney's
fees
are
not
recoverable
in
trademark
infringement
cases
under
the
lanham
act
primarily
because
the
congress
has
not
provided
for
them”.
in
other
words,
the
case
as
it
now
comes
before
this
court
for
consideration
presents
about
as
fundamental
question
in
the
administration
of
justice
as
you
could
find,
namely,
a
question
of
the
power,
of
an
equity
court
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
in
no
circumstances
whatever,
has
the
federal
court
the
power
to
award
attorney's
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
if
the
case
comes
here
in
regard
of
the
lanham
act
case.
but
what
they
have
said,
if
the
court
please,
what
the
court
says
is
so
broad
that
it
extends
to
all
kinds,
any
kind
of
equity
case
unless
you
can
turn
specifically
to
an
act
of
congress
that
says
in
this
kind
of
case,
you
may
award
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
short
of
the
fund
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
they
--
that's
right.
they
tried
to
distinguish
the
prior
cases
as
being
fund
cases
only.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
then
it's
still
an
important
question.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
have
the
same
argument.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
i
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
say
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
that
the
lanham
act
does
authorize
it,
but
if
it
doesn't,
it
does
not
subtract
from
a
power
already
present.
my
submission
mr.
justice
fortas
is
in
the
simplest
possible
terms
that
a
federal
equity
court
has
this
power
because
it
has
been
granted
by
congress
and
it
was
granted
by
congress
in
the
year
this
republic
was
born
in
1789
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
the
first
judiciary
act.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
never.
mr.
moses
lasky
your
honor,
there
is
no
expression
in
the
lanham
act
which
have
those
words.
ipsissima
verba
says,
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
there
is
no
such.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
the
power
--
the
lanham
act
section
35
says
that
a
registrant
whose
rights
have
been
violated
is
entitled
--
is
entitled
to
injunction
or
injunctions
of
previous
section,
to
the
defendant's
profits,
to
the
plaintiff's
damages,
and
the
cause
of
action
and
it
prefixes
all
by
saying
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
it's
my
submission
that
the
term
cause
of
actions
covers
this
question.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
yes.
it
does.
and
we
get
back
then
to
--
to
this
very
question.
this
question
first
came
to
this
court
in
19
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
sir.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
they
do.
now
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
i
say
that
if
the
lanham
act
had
nothing
in
it,
we
would
--
the
court
would
have
the
power.
but
it
happens
to
have
these
words
in
here
which
reaffirm
the
power
already
existing.
now,
i
go
back
to
sprague.
it
was,
of
course
in
1928,
that
this
court
first
had
the
question
before
it
whether
the
term
cost,
the
power
to
award
costs
is
included
within
it,
the
power
to
award
attorney's
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
well
in
1928,
this
court
said
we
do
not
have
to
pass
on
it
now.
then
that
question
came
back
to
this
court
in
sprague
in
‘39.
and
my
submission
is
that
in
the
historical
review,
this
court
traced
the
power
back
to
the
first
judiciary
act
and
said
that
a
federal
court
has
all
the
power
to
--
mr.
moses
lasky
it
was
--
mr.
moses
lasky
not
exactly.
it
was
in
the
context
of
something
approaching
a
fund
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
think
so.
but
the
court
took
pains
to
point
out
that
their
decision
was
not
so
limited.
and
it
said
we
–
a
discre
–
that
this
chancellor
has
a
broad
discretion.
and
i
submit
that
what
this
court
said
in
sprague
and
the
other
lower
courts,
since
it
was
so
construed
it,
that
the
power
to
award
attorney's
fees
was
not
confined
to
a
fund
case.
now
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
they're
lanham.
the
--
and
one
of
the
best
of
course
is
the
most
recent
one
from
the
second
circuit,
the
monsanto
case
was
a
lanham
act
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
all
are
lanham
act
case
except
the
first
one,
the
aladdin
case
which
was
decided
in
1941,
five
years
before
the
lanham
act
was
passed.
and
i
think
that's
significant.
now,
in
1939
this
court
in
the
sprague
case
held
and
what
it
held
i
think
is
--
is
best
summed
up
in
this
court's
own
language
in
vaughan
versus
atkinson
a
couple
of
years
ago
or
about
three
years
ago
in
these
words.
and
i
quote,
“as
we
said
in
sprague
versus
ticonic
bank,
307
u.s.
and
so
forth,
allowance
of
counsel
fees
and
other
expenses
entailed
by
litigation,
but
not
included
in
the
ordinary
taxable
costs
regulated
by
statute
is
part
of
the
historic
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts."
and
that
was
not
a
fund
case.
and
this
court
was
summing
up
what
was
held.
now,
two
years
later
after
this
decision
came
the
aladdin
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
in
the
aladdin
case,
this
is
what
the
court
said,
“counsel
fees
necessitated
by
the
tort”,
this
was
a
trademark
case
under
the
act
of
1905,
“it
had
been
sent
in
some
instances
to
be
recoverable
as
part
of
the
compensatory
damages
in
another
cases
as
part
of
exemplary
damages.
now,
it's
five
years
later
after
this,
the
lanham
act
was
passed.
the
lanham
act
was
passed.
it
has
in
it
the
words,
the
court
allows
the
cause
of
the
action
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity
and
my
submission
is
that
having
--
if
we
accomplished
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
under
the
bell
and
the
sprague
case
and
that
it
was
part
of
the
historic
power
of
the
federal
court
and
equity
to
award
cost
in
an
appropriate
case.
having
the
aladdin
case
which
says
that
traditionally,
a
cost
on
attorney's
fees
were
allowed
in
trademark
cases,
along
comes
the
lanham
act,
uses
the
term
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
and
that's
why
i
submit
that
in
that
sense,
the
lanham
act
affirmed
the
doctrine.
now,
let's
suppose
the
lanham
act
have
been
totally
silent
and
had
nothing
on
it.
the
lanham
act
did
not
confer
a
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts
in
trademark
cases.
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction,
the
federal
courts
could
have
had
jurisdiction
of
common
law
state
trademark
demands.
it
is
true
the
act
of
1905
in
the
lanham
act
put
aside
the
necessity
of
diversity
by
giving
a
jurisdiction
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
but
unless
--
now,
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
congress
by
an
act
would
extract
--
subtract
away
from
a
district
court's
power
in
any
particular
kind
of
case.
and
so
i
submit
that
if
the
lanham
act
did
wanted
to
subtract
that
power,
it
would
have
to
say
so
expressly
and
had
it
said
nothing
on
the
subject,
the
power
would
still
be
there,
but
it
went
further
and
said
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
now,
let
me
go
further
and
make
this
submission.
we
submit
the
trademark
cases
are
peculiarly
warranting
the
exercise
of
this
power.
perhaps
i
should
say
at
this
point,
i
am
not
urging
the
english
rule.
the
english
rule
--
even
though
this
power
derives
from
traditional
equity
practice,
the
english
rule
comes
pretty
close
to
being
‘the
prevailing
party
always
gets
his
attorney's
fees'.
this
is
not
the
rule
that
i
know
of,
that
any
american
court
has
laid
down.
it's
not
the
rule
i
have
urged.
the
rule
i
have
urged
stands
out
by
way
contrast
to
the
--
to
the
english
rules.
and
the
english
rule
in
trademark
cases
has
been
beautifully
set
forth
in
the
leading
english
textbook
on
trademark
litigation.
i'd
like
to
read
this
because
the
contrast
is
appealing.
an
unsuccessful
defendant
must
usually
pay
costs.
although
he
has
only
defended
the
mark
which
he
honestly
adopted
without
being
aware
of
its
true
great
resemblance
to
the
plaintiff's
mark
and
though
he
has
acted
without
fraud
and
an
ignorance
of
the
plaintiff's
rights
and
the
actions
has
been
commenced
against
him
without
notice”.
now
notice,
the
author
of
that
statement
assumes
it
to
be
too
obvious
to
need
demonstration
that
from
a
standpoint
of
justice
and
fairness
of
equity,
the
trademark
infringer
ought
to
pay
the
attorney's
fees
where
he
adopted
the
trademark
in
full
awareness
of
the
plaintiff's
rights,
acting
fraudulently
to
profit
from
plaintiff's
goodwill,
and
defiantly
after
a
notice
to
cease,
none
of
those
elements
are
necessary
in
england.
we
have
all
those
elements
necessary
here.
now,
my
submission
is
that
there
is
the
power.
and
the
next
question
is
“what
are
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
power
beyond
which
a
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
would
be
guilty
of
an
abuse
of
discretion?”
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
no.
i
think
it
would
exist
in
an
unfair
competition
case
--
mr.
moses
lasky
it
has
been
applied
on
business
secret
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
think
--
mr.
moses
lasky
let
me
explain
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
was
just
where
i
want
to
comment.
originally,
we
had
in
this
country
the
pioneer
notion
that
a
lawsuit
was
a
kind
sporting
event.
and
in
that
event,
a
situation
everybody
based
it
on
costs
of
that
sport.
now,
as
times
--
as
we
become
more
sophisticated
to
decide,
if
i
may
use
the
term,
it
has
come
to
be
recognized
more
and
more
that
in
some
kind
of
situations,
it's
fair
that
the
party
who
causes
the
expense
should
pay
for
it.
now,
we
know
that
we
have
many
actions
in
the
law.
and
if
i
may
generalize,
if
i
just
try
a
generalization,
i
would
say
that
whenever
a
public
interest
is
to
be
protected
as
well
as
a
private
right
to
be
vindicated
and
where
particularly
in
addition
otherwise,
there
would
be
little
deterrent
to
willful
misconduct,
there
is
a
strong
policy
in
allowing
a
court
to
impose
this
assessment.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court
in
law
cases
where
you
don't
have
the
historic
equity
power
as
this
court
has
announced,
congress
has
had
and
frequently
does
make
specific
provision
in
that
kind
of
case
as
in
the
sherman
act
cases,
as
in
securities
regulation.
now,
i
submit
in
equity
matters
where
the
power
already
exists,
it
would
be
anachronistic
to
withdraw
that
equity
power.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
are
not
other
kinds
of
equity
cases
where
the
power
ought
to
be
or
ought
not
to
be.
mr.
moses
lasky
a
fair
question
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
which
i'll
attempt
to
answer
right
now.
the
trademark
right
is
recognized
and
protected
under
the
lanham
act
because
it
protects
not
merely
the
private
right
but
the
public
interest.
when
the
lanham
act
was
enacted
in
1946,
the
senate
report
which
--
upon
which
the
enactment
was
based
contains
very
pertinent
statements.
it
said
the
purpose
underlying
any
trademark
statute
is
twofold.
one
is
to
protect
the
public
so
it
may
be
confident
that
in
purchasing
a
product
bearing
a
particular
trademark
which
is
favorably
knows,
it
will
get
the
product
that
is
asked
for
and
wants
to
get.
to
protect
trademarks,
therefore,
is
to
protect
the
public
from
deceit,
foster
fair
competition,
and
to
secure
to
the
business
community
advantages
of
reputation
and
goodwill.
the
emphasis
then
is
that
it's
not
merely
the
private
right.
it's
the
protection
of
the
public.
that's
the
element
number
one
why
trademark
cases
peculiarly
had
been
recognized
by
the
lower
courts
who's
justifying
this.
element
number
two
is
that
the
right
being
protected
in
the
trademark
case
while
tremendously
valuable
is
intangible.
it's
a
case
of
goodwill.
and
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
he
feels
that
he
doesn't
have
to,
it's
a
kind
of
“heads
i
win,
tails
i
don't
lose”
proposition.
i'll
go
ahead,
i'll
defy
it.
you'll
get
your
injunction,
i'll
stop.
it's
a
slap
on
the
wrist.
these
are
the
two
major
considerations
that
you
find
over
and
over
again
in
these
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
lanham
act
provides
of
course,
you
may
recover
damages
if
you
can
control
them.
unfortunately,
as
this
court
in
several
cases
like
the
nishiwaki
case
has
said
from
the
nature
of
a
trademark
violation,
it's
almost
impossible
ever
to
prove
actual
confusion,
you
can't
get
the
proof
to
prove
the
damages
which
is
why
trademarks
infringements
suits
are
hardly
ever
brought
at
law.
it
also
provides
for
an
accounting
of
profits.
but
unless
you
can
prove
that
the
defendant
has
made
some
profits,
there
is
nothing
there
either.
the
defendant
gaily
goes
along,
diluting
your
trademark.
if
he
puts
an
inferior
product
on
the
market,
it
dilutes
the
distinctiveness
of
your
mark.
it
erodes
it
away
and
you'll
end
with
an
injunction
after
he
has
been
defiantly
trying
to
pirate.
these
--
this
is
why
i
think
all
the
courts
which
heretofore
have
approached
this
matter
and
felt
that
a
trademark
case
peculiarly
wanted
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
section
36
confines
that
statement
to
the
assessment
of
damages,
damages
owned.i
have
section
35
rather,
in
assessing
damages,
the
court
may
enter
judgment
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
where
any
sum
above
the
amount
found
is
actual
damages,
not
exceedingly
to
that.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
that's
what
bothers
me.
now,
some
of
the
courts
as
your
honors
have
seen
from
these
cases
have
said
that
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
this
kind
of
case
is
to
be
justified
as
a
kind
of
damages.
and
it's
never
seemed
to
me
to
be
important
whether
you
brought
it
under
that
rubric
of
costs
or
damages,
it's
part
of
the
equity
power.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
is
--
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas
because
punitive
damages
imposes
a
penalty
which
it
has
no
relation
to
compensation
and
we
do
not
claim
here
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
get
an
award
more
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
than
its
own
attorney's
fees
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
cases,
the
aladdin
case
i
cited,
said
that
these
are
--
it
had
never
been
justified
as
punitive
damages.
it
says
that
they've
always
been
allowed
as
compensatory.
and
the
only
--
when
the
district
court
here
made
its
award,
the
question
put
to
them
is
what
would
be
the
reasonable
amount
that
the
petitioners
should
pay
their
counsel?
and
we
said,
“no
more
than
that
is
what
should
be
awarded”.
so
that
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
punitive
damages
because
when
this
case
is
over,
and
if
we
prevail
here,
all
that
the
petitioners
will
be
able
to
have
is
the
reimbursement
of
what
this
litigation
has
cost.
so
i
don't
think
it
is
the
--
it
can't
be
said
to
be
punitive.
now,
with
the
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon?
mr.
moses
lasky
not
a
word.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
legislative
--
mr.
moses
lasky
there
appears
to
be
not
a
word
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
not
a
word
on
it.
and
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
it
was
necessary.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
this
very
question
of
what
the
lanham
act
did
and
did
not
do
has
been
thoroughly
set
forth
in
an
opinion
in
the
a.
smith
bowman
case
by
chief
judge
leahy
in
the
district
of
delaware,
case
i
cite.
the
reason
i
refer
to
that
is
that
just
the
uniform
deceptive
trade
practices
act
which
had
viewed
the
uniform
law
commissioners
approved
of
in
1964,
the
american
bar
association
approved
of
in
1964
and
which
has
since
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
states,
provides
for
attorney's
fees
and
says
what
they
are
doing
is
kind
of
model
it
upon
the
power
exercised
by
the
federal
courts
in
trademark
cases
and
they
cite
the
a.
smith
bowman
case
as
an
exposition.
mr.
moses
lasky
this
was
the
uniform
--
mr.
moses
lasky
commissioners
on
uniform
state
law.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
believe
they
are,
yes.
it
supposed
to
be
--
mr.
moses
lasky
if
--
your
honor,
it
isn't
a
question
from
whether
a
lawyer
gets
his
fees
or
not.
i'm
going
to
be
paid
for
the
work,
my
firm
and
i,
one
way
or
the
other.
they
--
we're
going
to
be
paid
by
our
client.
the
question
is
whether
the
client
is
going
to
be
reimbursed.
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
lawyer's
fees
at
all.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
lawyer
is
going
to
get
his
compensation
for
his
services
or
not.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
depends
on
who's
more
solved;
your
own
client
or
the
other
party.
i
see
i
have
the
white
light
here
and
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
would
--
yes,
i
know.
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
your
question,
otherwise
i
would
reserve
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
for
a
reply.
mr.
moses
lasky
i'll
simply
make
this
submission
that
the
power
--
the
power
as
such
does
exist.
the
next
question
is
what
are
the
outer
limits
of
that
power?
and
once
you've
circumscribed
the
outer
limits,
there's
a
wide
range
of
discretion
in
the
district
judge.
that
was
exercised
and
the
concurrent
findings
of
both
courts
below
showed
that
it
was
appropriate
degree
of
exercise.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it
comes
necessary
for
me
to
straighten
out
the
narration
of
what
happened
in
this
case
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
say
we've
been
accused
of
some
impropriety
here.
when
this
case
was
first
tried,
the
trial
judge
decided
for
the
defendants
and
on
appeal,
he
was
reversed
and
the
court
pointed
that
he
had
gone
off
on
a
complete
misconception
of
the
rule
of
law,
namely
that
the
goods
has
to
be
of
the
same
descriptive
properties
which
was
the
test
under
the
old
act.
that
was
a
mistake
of
a
legal
application.
the
court
of
appeals
examined
it
and
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
apart
from
that,
the
defendants
had
been
guilty
of
bad
faith.
and
in
their
opinion,
they
stated
and
when
the
case
came
back
down
with
the
trial
court
advice
of
the
true
rule
of
law,
he
made
a
finding.
and
i
had
assumed
that
that
finding
was
behind
us
and
we
come
into
the
court
upon
the
basis
of
that
finding
which
is
this.
without
seeking
legal
advise
and
for
the
purpose
of
capitalizing
upon
the
popularity
of
the
name
thus
chosen,
defendant
maier
did
deliberately
adopted
the
name
‘black
&
white'
knowing
that
‘black
&
white'
was
the
name
and
trademark
of
the
plaintiff
buchanan,
and
knowing
that
this
popularity
would
extend
to
its
product
because
the
public
would
associate
the
name
‘black
&
white'
with
a
long
established
reliability
and
meritoriousness
of
buchanan's
product.
defendants
intended
to
adopt
plaintiff
buchanan's
‘black
&
white'
name
or
mark
for
the
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
the
aura
of
goodwill
which
surrounded
the
name.
and
they
deliberately
adopted
the
name
with
a
view
to
obtaining
advantage
from
the
goodwill,
good
name
and
good
trade,
which
buchanan
had
build
up,
and
expecting
that
there
would
be
confusion
and
result
in
profit.
defendants
refused
to
discontinue
their
use
on
beer
of
the
name
‘black
&
white'
upon
request
made
before
a
suit
filed
and
they
have
knowingly,
willfully,
and
deliberately
infringed
the
said
marked
‘black
&
white'
complainant's
rights
thereto.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
was
bad
faith.
now,
in
their
brief
here,
counsel
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
finding
was
without
evidence
to
support
it.
it
was
in
that
connection
that
in
the
footnote
in
my
reply
brief
i
quoted
some
of
the
evidence
in
which
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
hadn't
been
put
into
the
record
that
brought
out
there
because
i
thought
the
finding
was
behind
us.
but
if
it
becomes
important,
it's
in
the
record
of
the
case
and
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice.
now,
when
the
case
went
back
down,
if
the
court
remanded
it
for
all
purposes
consistent
with
its
opinion
and
i
made
a
motion
to
enter
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal.
as
for
the
injunction,
attorney's
fees,
accounting
of
profits,
counsel
have
its
predecessors.
this
counsel
was
not
in
the
case
that
every
opportunity
introduced
any
further
evidence
they
wanted.
and
the
matter
was
submitted
in
the
court,
in
due
course,
entered
its
order
that
were
entitled
to
injunction,
to
an
accounting,
to
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
and
set
down
a
time
for
hearing
each
one
of
these.
following
it
through
the
procedures
of
this
calendar,
it
heard
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees
first,
entered
an
order
while
we
were
still
fussing
with
the
accounting.
an
appeal
ought
not
to
have
been
taken
at
that
time.
this
interlocutory
appeal
was
improper
and
an
appeal
should
have
been
taken
only
when
the
accounting
was
completed.
it
has
since
been
completed.
and
there
is
now
an
appeal
pending
from
a
judgment
for
the
profits
too.
when
it
got
up
under
the
court
of
appeals,
they
properly
dismissed
this
interlocutory
appeal.
and
then
over
my
opposition,
the
district
court
certified
that
it
was
an
appropriate
interlocutory
appeal.
again,
another
appeal
was
taken
and
that's
how
we
happen
to
be
here.
but
now,
your
honor
suggested
that
i
was
arguing
that
there
should
be
attorney's
fees
allowable
on
a
jury
tried
case.
no,
not
at
all.
that's
an
action
of
law.
the
equity
power
would
not
extend
it
to
it
but
in
an
action
of
law
where
damages
are
recovered
and
proved,
we
come
in
under
the
other
section
of
three
times
the
damages
allowed.
and
most
trademark
cases
are
in
equity
as
this
was
in
equity
because
of
the
impossibility
of
getting
the
evidence
to
prove
confusion.
it
was
never
admitted
there
was
not
confusion.
it
was
simply
the
impossibility
that
the
courts
have
always
referred
to
about
getting
the
evidence
of
confusion.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
patent
history
in
which
it
has
been
said
that
this
court,
years
ago,
held
that
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
recovered
in
the
patent
case.
on
the
contrary,
what
this
court
had
held
in
two
or
three
cases
a
hundred
years
ago
was
something
rather
different.
counsel
fees
are
not
a
proper
element
for
the
consideration
of
the
jury
in
the
estimation
of
damages
and
actions
for
the
infringement
of
a
patent
right.
many
patent
cases
are
jury
actions
because
there,
you
prove
the
damages
because
the
plaintiff
has
a
monopoly
of
the
product
in
any
sale
is
a
violation.
mr.
moses
lasky
had
there
been?
this
provision
has
been
on
the
books
for
long
--
the
courts
relate
to
the
--
referred
to
the
statute.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
attorney's
fees
are
frequently
allowed
in
patent
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
when
was
the
statute
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
very
well,
probably
the
statute
has
been
there
so
long
that
the
people
would
actually
refer
to
the
statute.
i
had
hoped
to
have
one
more
remark
but
i
see
my
red
light
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
nearly
nine
years
ago
that
the
makers
and
american
distributors
of
the
famous
‘black
&
white'
whiskey
sought
to
have
the
respondents
discontinue
an
infringement
of
the
‘black
&
white'
label
on
alcoholic
beverages.
as
the
district
court
has
said
in
the
record,
“we
used
every
reasonable
effort
to
obtain
some
reasonable
accord
about
that
without
bringing
a
suit.
but
we
were
defied.”
the
suit
was
brought
for
trademark
infringement.
and
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
about
three
years
ago
to
which
this
court
then
denied
review
in
1963,
we
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
respondents
pirating
the
‘black
&
white'
trademark
on
alcoholic
beverages.
upon
concurrent
findings
of
both
courts
below,
it
is
the
law
of
this
case
that
the
respondents'
conduct
was
not
only
an
infringement
but
that
it
was
willful,
fraudulent,
and
bad
faith.
and
that
the
only
rational
explanation
of
respondents'
conduct
in
adopting
the
name
‘black
&
white'
in
the
first
place
and
then
in
persistently
defying
the
petitioners
when
asked
to
cease
and
even
of
carrying
the
case
or
attempting
to
carry
it
up
to
this
court
was
that
they
were
trying
to
trade
on
the
real
‘black
&
white's
goodwill,
in
other
words
if
this
was
a
case
of
a
careless
and
recalcitrant
attitude,
a
willful
and
persistent
defiance.
now,
if
the
court
please,
for
years,
it
has
been
accepted
indeed
as
harmful
blow
that
in
trademark
infringement
suits
in
the
federal
courts
in
equity,
federal
courts
have
the
power
in
appropriate
and
proper
circumstances
to
assess
against
the
infringing
defendants,
the
litigation
expenses
including
attorney's
fees
which
their
conduct
has
imposed
upon
the
plaintiff.
the
circumstance
on
which
that
power
could
be
and
should
be
exercised
has
been
variously
expressed.
but
i
think
they
can
all
be
summed
up
in
terms
of
willful
conduct
--
willful
misconduct
where
the
infringer
has
acted
knowingly
and
with
deliberate
purpose
to
fill
the
goodwill
of
the
trademark
owner
and
in
persistent
defiance
of
the
owner's
rights.
now,
until
this
case
now
before
the
court
came
to
the
court
below,
every
federal
court
of
appeals
had
to
dealt
with
this
matter,
every
--
at
least
every
court
of
appeals
in
which
there
is
any
report
of
the
matter,
and
numerous
district
courts
have
upheld
the
power.
and
it
has
been
repeatedly
been
exercised
below
and
above
where
awards
of
fees
have
been
affirmed
and
additional
awards
have
been
granted.

to
the
court
decisions
of
the
first,
second,
third
and
seventh
circuits
in
trademark
cases
indeed
from
the
first
--
from
the
second
circuit,
a
decision
on
which
this
court
denied
review
just
last
term.
we
cite
decisions
on
unfair
competition
cases
from
the
sixth
and
the
seventh
circuit.
and
one
from
the
second
circuit
handed
down
just
two
months
ago,
a
week
or
two
after
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
was
filed
in
this
court
where
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
was
justified
by
the
court
because
defendant's
conduct
was
described
as
intentional,
vexatious,
and
fraudulent.
we
cited
decisions
from
the
fourth
circuit
which
relies
on
these
very
trademark
decisions.
and
until
this
case,
that
had
also
been
the
settled
law
in
the
whole
series
of
decisions
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there
were
no
cases
to
the
contrary.
and
so
after
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
several
years
ago,
we
applied
to
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment
accordingly
and
we
got
our
injunction
against
infringement.
and
proceeding
upon
this
solid
and
unanimous
chain
of
authority,
the
district
court
then
appraised
the
circumstances
and
determined
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
and
its
appraisal
of
the
facts
that
an
award
of
fees
and
litigation
expenses
should
be
made
and
an
award
was
entered.
an
interlocutory
appeal
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit,
from
that
order
it
allowed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
overruled
its
prior
decisions.
in
so
many
words,
it
said
they
were
bad
law.
and
it
looked
at
the
decisions
from
the
other
courts
of
appeals.
and
it
said
as
to
them,
they
are
not
well
considered.
it
said
it
would
not
follow
them
and
its
conclusion
was
this,
“we
hold
that
attorney's
fees
are
not
recoverable
in
trademark
infringement
cases
under
the
lanham
act
primarily
because
the
congress
has
not
provided
for
them”.
in
other
words,
the
case
as
it
now
comes
before
this
court
for
consideration
presents
about
as
fundamental
question
in
the
administration
of
justice
as
you
could
find,
namely,
a
question
of
the
power,
of
an
equity
court
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
in
no
circumstances
whatever,
has
the
federal
court
the
power
to
award
attorney's
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
if
the
case
comes
here
in
regard
of
the
lanham
act
case.
but
what
they
have
said,
if
the
court
please,
what
the
court
says
is
so
broad
that
it
extends
to
all
kinds,
any
kind
of
equity
case
unless
you
can
turn
specifically
to
an
act
of
congress
that
says
in
this
kind
of
case,
you
may
award
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
short
of
the
fund
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
they
--
that's
right.
they
tried
to
distinguish
the
prior
cases
as
being
fund
cases
only.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
then
it's
still
an
important
question.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
have
the
same
argument.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
i
do.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
say
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
that
the
lanham
act
does
authorize
it,
but
if
it
doesn't,
it
does
not
subtract
from
a
power
already
present.
my
submission
mr.
justice
fortas
is
in
the
simplest
possible
terms
that
a
federal
equity
court
has
this
power
because
it
has
been
granted
by
congress
and
it
was
granted
by
congress
in
the
year
this
republic
was
born
in
1789
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
the
first
judiciary
act.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
never.
mr.
moses
lasky
your
honor,
there
is
no
expression
in
the
lanham
act
which
have
those
words.
ipsissima
verba
says,
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
there
is
no
such.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
the
power
--
the
lanham
act
section
35
says
that
a
registrant
whose
rights
have
been
violated
is
entitled
--
is
entitled
to
injunction
or
injunctions
of
previous
section,
to
the
defendant's
profits,
to
the
plaintiff's
damages,
and
the
cause
of
action
and
it
prefixes
all
by
saying
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
it's
my
submission
that
the
term
cause
of
actions
covers
this
question.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
yes.
it
does.
and
we
get
back
then
to
--
to
this
very
question.
this
question
first
came
to
this
court
in
19
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
sir.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
they
do.
now
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
i
say
that
if
the
lanham
act
had
nothing
in
it,
we
would
--
the
court
would
have
the
power.
but
it
happens
to
have
these
words
in
here
which
reaffirm
the
power
already
existing.
now,
i
go
back
to
sprague.
it
was,
of
course
in
1928,
that
this
court
first
had
the
question
before
it
whether
the
term
cost,
the
power
to
award
costs
is
included
within
it,
the
power
to
award
attorney's
fees.
mr.
moses
lasky
well
in
1928,
this
court
said
we
do
not
have
to
pass
on
it
now.
then
that
question
came
back
to
this
court
in
sprague
in
‘39.
and
my
submission
is
that
in
the
historical
review,
this
court
traced
the
power
back
to
the
first
judiciary
act
and
said
that
a
federal
court
has
all
the
power
to
--
mr.
moses
lasky
it
was
--
mr.
moses
lasky
not
exactly.
it
was
in
the
context
of
something
approaching
a
fund
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
think
so.
but
the
court
took
pains
to
point
out
that
their
decision
was
not
so
limited.
and
it
said
we
–
a
discre
–
that
this
chancellor
has
a
broad
discretion.
and
i
submit
that
what
this
court
said
in
sprague
and
the
other
lower
courts,
since
it
was
so
construed
it,
that
the
power
to
award
attorney's
fees
was
not
confined
to
a
fund
case.
now
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
they're
lanham.
the
--
and
one
of
the
best
of
course
is
the
most
recent
one
from
the
second
circuit,
the
monsanto
case
was
a
lanham
act
case.
mr.
moses
lasky
all
are
lanham
act
case
except
the
first
one,
the
aladdin
case
which
was
decided
in
1941,
five
years
before
the
lanham
act
was
passed.
and
i
think
that's
significant.
now,
in
1939
this
court
in
the
sprague
case
held
and
what
it
held
i
think
is
--
is
best
summed
up
in
this
court's
own
language
in
vaughan
versus
atkinson
a
couple
of
years
ago
or
about
three
years
ago
in
these
words.
and
i
quote,
“as
we
said
in
sprague
versus
ticonic
bank,
307
u.s.
and
so
forth,
allowance
of
counsel
fees
and
other
expenses
entailed
by
litigation,
but
not
included
in
the
ordinary
taxable
costs
regulated
by
statute
is
part
of
the
historic
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts."
and
that
was
not
a
fund
case.
and
this
court
was
summing
up
what
was
held.
now,
two
years
later
after
this
decision
came
the
aladdin
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
in
the
aladdin
case,
this
is
what
the
court
said,
“counsel
fees
necessitated
by
the
tort”,
this
was
a
trademark
case
under
the
act
of
1905,
“it
had
been
sent
in
some
instances
to
be
recoverable
as
part
of
the
compensatory
damages
in
another
cases
as
part
of
exemplary
damages.
now,
it's
five
years
later
after
this,
the
lanham
act
was
passed.
the
lanham
act
was
passed.
it
has
in
it
the
words,
the
court
allows
the
cause
of
the
action
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity
and
my
submission
is
that
having
--
if
we
accomplished
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
under
the
bell
and
the
sprague
case
and
that
it
was
part
of
the
historic
power
of
the
federal
court
and
equity
to
award
cost
in
an
appropriate
case.
having
the
aladdin
case
which
says
that
traditionally,
a
cost
on
attorney's
fees
were
allowed
in
trademark
cases,
along
comes
the
lanham
act,
uses
the
term
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
and
that's
why
i
submit
that
in
that
sense,
the
lanham
act
affirmed
the
doctrine.
now,
let's
suppose
the
lanham
act
have
been
totally
silent
and
had
nothing
on
it.
the
lanham
act
did
not
confer
a
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts
in
trademark
cases.
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction,
the
federal
courts
could
have
had
jurisdiction
of
common
law
state
trademark
demands.
it
is
true
the
act
of
1905
in
the
lanham
act
put
aside
the
necessity
of
diversity
by
giving
a
jurisdiction
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
but
unless
--
now,
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
congress
by
an
act
would
extract
--
subtract
away
from
a
district
court's
power
in
any
particular
kind
of
case.
and
so
i
submit
that
if
the
lanham
act
did
wanted
to
subtract
that
power,
it
would
have
to
say
so
expressly
and
had
it
said
nothing
on
the
subject,
the
power
would
still
be
there,
but
it
went
further
and
said
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
now,
let
me
go
further
and
make
this
submission.
we
submit
the
trademark
cases
are
peculiarly
warranting
the
exercise
of
this
power.
perhaps
i
should
say
at
this
point,
i
am
not
urging
the
english
rule.
the
english
rule
--
even
though
this
power
derives
from
traditional
equity
practice,
the
english
rule
comes
pretty
close
to
being
‘the
prevailing
party
always
gets
his
attorney's
fees'.
this
is
not
the
rule
that
i
know
of,
that
any
american
court
has
laid
down.
it's
not
the
rule
i
have
urged.
the
rule
i
have
urged
stands
out
by
way
contrast
to
the
--
to
the
english
rules.
and
the
english
rule
in
trademark
cases
has
been
beautifully
set
forth
in
the
leading
english
textbook
on
trademark
litigation.
i'd
like
to
read
this
because
the
contrast
is
appealing.
an
unsuccessful
defendant
must
usually
pay
costs.
although
he
has
only
defended
the
mark
which
he
honestly
adopted
without
being
aware
of
its
true
great
resemblance
to
the
plaintiff's
mark
and
though
he
has
acted
without
fraud
and
an
ignorance
of
the
plaintiff's
rights
and
the
actions
has
been
commenced
against
him
without
notice”.
now
notice,
the
author
of
that
statement
assumes
it
to
be
too
obvious
to
need
demonstration
that
from
a
standpoint
of
justice
and
fairness
of
equity,
the
trademark
infringer
ought
to
pay
the
attorney's
fees
where
he
adopted
the
trademark
in
full
awareness
of
the
plaintiff's
rights,
acting
fraudulently
to
profit
from
plaintiff's
goodwill,
and
defiantly
after
a
notice
to
cease,
none
of
those
elements
are
necessary
in
england.
we
have
all
those
elements
necessary
here.
now,
my
submission
is
that
there
is
the
power.
and
the
next
question
is
“what
are
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
power
beyond
which
a
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
would
be
guilty
of
an
abuse
of
discretion?”
mr.
moses
lasky
no,
no.
i
think
it
would
exist
in
an
unfair
competition
case
--
mr.
moses
lasky
it
has
been
applied
on
business
secret
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
think
--
mr.
moses
lasky
let
me
explain
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
was
just
where
i
want
to
comment.
originally,
we
had
in
this
country
the
pioneer
notion
that
a
lawsuit
was
a
kind
sporting
event.
and
in
that
event,
a
situation
everybody
based
it
on
costs
of
that
sport.
now,
as
times
--
as
we
become
more
sophisticated
to
decide,
if
i
may
use
the
term,
it
has
come
to
be
recognized
more
and
more
that
in
some
kind
of
situations,
it's
fair
that
the
party
who
causes
the
expense
should
pay
for
it.
now,
we
know
that
we
have
many
actions
in
the
law.
and
if
i
may
generalize,
if
i
just
try
a
generalization,
i
would
say
that
whenever
a
public
interest
is
to
be
protected
as
well
as
a
private
right
to
be
vindicated
and
where
particularly
in
addition
otherwise,
there
would
be
little
deterrent
to
willful
misconduct,
there
is
a
strong
policy
in
allowing
a
court
to
impose
this
assessment.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court
in
law
cases
where
you
don't
have
the
historic
equity
power
as
this
court
has
announced,
congress
has
had
and
frequently
does
make
specific
provision
in
that
kind
of
case
as
in
the
sherman
act
cases,
as
in
securities
regulation.
now,
i
submit
in
equity
matters
where
the
power
already
exists,
it
would
be
anachronistic
to
withdraw
that
equity
power.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
are
not
other
kinds
of
equity
cases
where
the
power
ought
to
be
or
ought
not
to
be.
mr.
moses
lasky
a
fair
question
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
which
i'll
attempt
to
answer
right
now.
the
trademark
right
is
recognized
and
protected
under
the
lanham
act
because
it
protects
not
merely
the
private
right
but
the
public
interest.
when
the
lanham
act
was
enacted
in
1946,
the
senate
report
which
--
upon
which
the
enactment
was
based
contains
very
pertinent
statements.
it
said
the
purpose
underlying
any
trademark
statute
is
twofold.
one
is
to
protect
the
public
so
it
may
be
confident
that
in
purchasing
a
product
bearing
a
particular
trademark
which
is
favorably
knows,
it
will
get
the
product
that
is
asked
for
and
wants
to
get.
to
protect
trademarks,
therefore,
is
to
protect
the
public
from
deceit,
foster
fair
competition,
and
to
secure
to
the
business
community
advantages
of
reputation
and
goodwill.
the
emphasis
then
is
that
it's
not
merely
the
private
right.
it's
the
protection
of
the
public.
that's
the
element
number
one
why
trademark
cases
peculiarly
had
been
recognized
by
the
lower
courts
who's
justifying
this.
element
number
two
is
that
the
right
being
protected
in
the
trademark
case
while
tremendously
valuable
is
intangible.
it's
a
case
of
goodwill.
and
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
he
feels
that
he
doesn't
have
to,
it's
a
kind
of
“heads
i
win,
tails
i
don't
lose”
proposition.
i'll
go
ahead,
i'll
defy
it.
you'll
get
your
injunction,
i'll
stop.
it's
a
slap
on
the
wrist.
these
are
the
two
major
considerations
that
you
find
over
and
over
again
in
these
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
lanham
act
provides
of
course,
you
may
recover
damages
if
you
can
control
them.
unfortunately,
as
this
court
in
several
cases
like
the
nishiwaki
case
has
said
from
the
nature
of
a
trademark
violation,
it's
almost
impossible
ever
to
prove
actual
confusion,
you
can't
get
the
proof
to
prove
the
damages
which
is
why
trademarks
infringements
suits
are
hardly
ever
brought
at
law.
it
also
provides
for
an
accounting
of
profits.
but
unless
you
can
prove
that
the
defendant
has
made
some
profits,
there
is
nothing
there
either.
the
defendant
gaily
goes
along,
diluting
your
trademark.
if
he
puts
an
inferior
product
on
the
market,
it
dilutes
the
distinctiveness
of
your
mark.
it
erodes
it
away
and
you'll
end
with
an
injunction
after
he
has
been
defiantly
trying
to
pirate.
these
--
this
is
why
i
think
all
the
courts
which
heretofore
have
approached
this
matter
and
felt
that
a
trademark
case
peculiarly
wanted
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
section
36
confines
that
statement
to
the
assessment
of
damages,
damages
owned.i
have
section
35
rather,
in
assessing
damages,
the
court
may
enter
judgment
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
where
any
sum
above
the
amount
found
is
actual
damages,
not
exceedingly
to
that.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
that's
what
bothers
me.
now,
some
of
the
courts
as
your
honors
have
seen
from
these
cases
have
said
that
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
this
kind
of
case
is
to
be
justified
as
a
kind
of
damages.
and
it's
never
seemed
to
me
to
be
important
whether
you
brought
it
under
that
rubric
of
costs
or
damages,
it's
part
of
the
equity
power.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
is
--
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas
because
punitive
damages
imposes
a
penalty
which
it
has
no
relation
to
compensation
and
we
do
not
claim
here
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
get
an
award
more
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
than
its
own
attorney's
fees
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
moses
lasky
the
cases,
the
aladdin
case
i
cited,
said
that
these
are
--
it
had
never
been
justified
as
punitive
damages.
it
says
that
they've
always
been
allowed
as
compensatory.
and
the
only
--
when
the
district
court
here
made
its
award,
the
question
put
to
them
is
what
would
be
the
reasonable
amount
that
the
petitioners
should
pay
their
counsel?
and
we
said,
“no
more
than
that
is
what
should
be
awarded”.
so
that
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
punitive
damages
because
when
this
case
is
over,
and
if
we
prevail
here,
all
that
the
petitioners
will
be
able
to
have
is
the
reimbursement
of
what
this
litigation
has
cost.
so
i
don't
think
it
is
the
--
it
can't
be
said
to
be
punitive.
now,
with
the
--
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon?
mr.
moses
lasky
not
a
word.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
legislative
--
mr.
moses
lasky
there
appears
to
be
not
a
word
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
not
a
word
on
it.
and
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
it
was
necessary.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
this
very
question
of
what
the
lanham
act
did
and
did
not
do
has
been
thoroughly
set
forth
in
an
opinion
in
the
a.
smith
bowman
case
by
chief
judge
leahy
in
the
district
of
delaware,
case
i
cite.
the
reason
i
refer
to
that
is
that
just
the
uniform
deceptive
trade
practices
act
which
had
viewed
the
uniform
law
commissioners
approved
of
in
1964,
the
american
bar
association
approved
of
in
1964
and
which
has
since
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
states,
provides
for
attorney's
fees
and
says
what
they
are
doing
is
kind
of
model
it
upon
the
power
exercised
by
the
federal
courts
in
trademark
cases
and
they
cite
the
a.
smith
bowman
case
as
an
exposition.
mr.
moses
lasky
this
was
the
uniform
--
mr.
moses
lasky
commissioners
on
uniform
state
law.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
believe
they
are,
yes.
it
supposed
to
be
--
mr.
moses
lasky
if
--
your
honor,
it
isn't
a
question
from
whether
a
lawyer
gets
his
fees
or
not.
i'm
going
to
be
paid
for
the
work,
my
firm
and
i,
one
way
or
the
other.
they
--
we're
going
to
be
paid
by
our
client.
the
question
is
whether
the
client
is
going
to
be
reimbursed.
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
lawyer's
fees
at
all.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
lawyer
is
going
to
get
his
compensation
for
his
services
or
not.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
depends
on
who's
more
solved;
your
own
client
or
the
other
party.
i
see
i
have
the
white
light
here
and
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
would
--
yes,
i
know.
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
your
question,
otherwise
i
would
reserve
--
mr.
moses
lasky
--
for
a
reply.
mr.
moses
lasky
i'll
simply
make
this
submission
that
the
power
--
the
power
as
such
does
exist.
the
next
question
is
what
are
the
outer
limits
of
that
power?
and
once
you've
circumscribed
the
outer
limits,
there's
a
wide
range
of
discretion
in
the
district
judge.
that
was
exercised
and
the
concurrent
findings
of
both
courts
below
showed
that
it
was
appropriate
degree
of
exercise.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it
comes
necessary
for
me
to
straighten
out
the
narration
of
what
happened
in
this
case
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
say
we've
been
accused
of
some
impropriety
here.
when
this
case
was
first
tried,
the
trial
judge
decided
for
the
defendants
and
on
appeal,
he
was
reversed
and
the
court
pointed
that
he
had
gone
off
on
a
complete
misconception
of
the
rule
of
law,
namely
that
the
goods
has
to
be
of
the
same
descriptive
properties
which
was
the
test
under
the
old
act.
that
was
a
mistake
of
a
legal
application.
the
court
of
appeals
examined
it
and
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
apart
from
that,
the
defendants
had
been
guilty
of
bad
faith.
and
in
their
opinion,
they
stated
and
when
the
case
came
back
down
with
the
trial
court
advice
of
the
true
rule
of
law,
he
made
a
finding.
and
i
had
assumed
that
that
finding
was
behind
us
and
we
come
into
the
court
upon
the
basis
of
that
finding
which
is
this.
without
seeking
legal
advise
and
for
the
purpose
of
capitalizing
upon
the
popularity
of
the
name
thus
chosen,
defendant
maier
did
deliberately
adopted
the
name
‘black
&
white'
knowing
that
‘black
&
white'
was
the
name
and
trademark
of
the
plaintiff
buchanan,
and
knowing
that
this
popularity
would
extend
to
its
product
because
the
public
would
associate
the
name
‘black
&
white'
with
a
long
established
reliability
and
meritoriousness
of
buchanan's
product.
defendants
intended
to
adopt
plaintiff
buchanan's
‘black
&
white'
name
or
mark
for
the
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
the
aura
of
goodwill
which
surrounded
the
name.
and
they
deliberately
adopted
the
name
with
a
view
to
obtaining
advantage
from
the
goodwill,
good
name
and
good
trade,
which
buchanan
had
build
up,
and
expecting
that
there
would
be
confusion
and
result
in
profit.
defendants
refused
to
discontinue
their
use
on
beer
of
the
name
‘black
&
white'
upon
request
made
before
a
suit
filed
and
they
have
knowingly,
willfully,
and
deliberately
infringed
the
said
marked
‘black
&
white'
complainant's
rights
thereto.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
was
bad
faith.
now,
in
their
brief
here,
counsel
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
finding
was
without
evidence
to
support
it.
it
was
in
that
connection
that
in
the
footnote
in
my
reply
brief
i
quoted
some
of
the
evidence
in
which
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
hadn't
been
put
into
the
record
that
brought
out
there
because
i
thought
the
finding
was
behind
us.
but
if
it
becomes
important,
it's
in
the
record
of
the
case
and
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice.
now,
when
the
case
went
back
down,
if
the
court
remanded
it
for
all
purposes
consistent
with
its
opinion
and
i
made
a
motion
to
enter
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal.
as
for
the
injunction,
attorney's
fees,
accounting
of
profits,
counsel
have
its
predecessors.
this
counsel
was
not
in
the
case
that
every
opportunity
introduced
any
further
evidence
they
wanted.
and
the
matter
was
submitted
in
the
court,
in
due
course,
entered
its
order
that
were
entitled
to
injunction,
to
an
accounting,
to
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
and
set
down
a
time
for
hearing
each
one
of
these.
following
it
through
the
procedures
of
this
calendar,
it
heard
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees
first,
entered
an
order
while
we
were
still
fussing
with
the
accounting.
an
appeal
ought
not
to
have
been
taken
at
that
time.
this
interlocutory
appeal
was
improper
and
an
appeal
should
have
been
taken
only
when
the
accounting
was
completed.
it
has
since
been
completed.
and
there
is
now
an
appeal
pending
from
a
judgment
for
the
profits
too.
when
it
got
up
under
the
court
of
appeals,
they
properly
dismissed
this
interlocutory
appeal.
and
then
over
my
opposition,
the
district
court
certified
that
it
was
an
appropriate
interlocutory
appeal.
again,
another
appeal
was
taken
and
that's
how
we
happen
to
be
here.
but
now,
your
honor
suggested
that
i
was
arguing
that
there
should
be
attorney's
fees
allowable
on
a
jury
tried
case.
no,
not
at
all.
that's
an
action
of
law.
the
equity
power
would
not
extend
it
to
it
but
in
an
action
of
law
where
damages
are
recovered
and
proved,
we
come
in
under
the
other
section
of
three
times
the
damages
allowed.
and
most
trademark
cases
are
in
equity
as
this
was
in
equity
because
of
the
impossibility
of
getting
the
evidence
to
prove
confusion.
it
was
never
admitted
there
was
not
confusion.
it
was
simply
the
impossibility
that
the
courts
have
always
referred
to
about
getting
the
evidence
of
confusion.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
patent
history
in
which
it
has
been
said
that
this
court,
years
ago,
held
that
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
recovered
in
the
patent
case.
on
the
contrary,
what
this
court
had
held
in
two
or
three
cases
a
hundred
years
ago
was
something
rather
different.
counsel
fees
are
not
a
proper
element
for
the
consideration
of
the
jury
in
the
estimation
of
damages
and
actions
for
the
infringement
of
a
patent
right.
many
patent
cases
are
jury
actions
because
there,
you
prove
the
damages
because
the
plaintiff
has
a
monopoly
of
the
product
in
any
sale
is
a
violation.
mr.
moses
lasky
had
there
been?
this
provision
has
been
on
the
books
for
long
--
the
courts
relate
to
the
--
referred
to
the
statute.
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
attorney's
fees
are
frequently
allowed
in
patent
cases.
mr.
moses
lasky
when
was
the
statute
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
very
well,
probably
the
statute
has
been
there
so
long
that
the
people
would
actually
refer
to
the
statute.
i
had
hoped
to
have
one
more
remark
but
i
see
my
red
light
is
up.
thank
you.
