your

well,
the
reason
i
asked
you
that
question,
i
wasn't
clear
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
with
whether
or
not
on
the
candor
of
equitable
powers
of
the
court,
they
said
there
were
no
such
powers
available
under
the
lanham
act,
or
whether
they
said,
yes
there
was
power
to
this
but
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
where
they're
exercised.
