mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondents
submit,
if
i
may
first
outline
our
view
of
the
matter,
that
first,
we
have
eliminated
all
state
issues
of
unfair
competition.
it
was
eliminated
by
earlier
opinions
in
the
case
which
are
now
final
and
binding
on
all
parties.
there
is
no
question
of
misrepresentation
coming
on
advertising,
discouragement,
or
injury.
there
are
no
damages.
and
at
the
time
this
was
made,
there
was
no
accounting.
the
first
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
particularly
held
that
they
were
going
to
decide
the
case
and
did
so
entirely
on
the
lanham
act
dealing
with
what
appears
to
be
the
delusion
theory
as
i
read
some
of
the
cases
and
comments,
but
they
spelled
it
out
in
that
opinion
as
anticipation
of
future
confusion.
it
is
a
--
an
unqualified
and
unreversed,
uncriticized
finding
of
the
district
court
in
the
trial.
there
was
only
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
no
confusion.
we
therefore
have
the
case
limited
strictly
within
the
confines
of
the
lanham
act.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
as
i
understand
the
lanham
act
provision
which
is
section
1117
of
the
u.s.
code
36
as
i
believe
is
the
lanham
act
section,
the
court
may
award
compensation,
actual
damages
which
can
be
measured
by
either
one
or
perhaps
and
i'm
not
certain
about
this,
a
combination
of
two
measures.
the
actual
damages
and
those
are
the
words
used
in
the
section
separated
by
the
trademark
plaintiff,
and
an
accounting
of
the
profits
of
the
infringer
and
accounting
on
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
--
that
can
get
one
or
both
or
perhaps
its
one
recovery.
the
act
then
provides
that
the
court
may
allow
additional
amounts
up
to
three
times
the
amount
of
actual
damages.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
up
to
three
times
the
actual
damages
as
determined
by
either
one
of
these
methods
or
a
combination
of
them.
the
act,
however,
has
a
very
specific
provision
in
the
same
section
which
says
that
all
such
awards
must
be
--
shall
constitute
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
exactly,
“shall
constitute
compensation
and
not
a
penalty”.
now,
there's
another
factor
which
i
think
is
raised
by
the
question.
all
of
these
damages
must
come
from
the
act
of
the
infringer
that
is
described
as
actionable
in
the
earlier
section,
which
is
in
the
code
1114,
and
it
there
provides
that
this
use
must
be
in
commerce.
in
other
words,
as
we
read
it,
no
damages
of
any
kind
or
nature
can
be
recovered
unless
the
acts
that
are
complained
of
occurred
in
interstate
of
foreign
commerce
by
the
use
of
the
mark
which
is
registered.
if
that
is
so
then,
attorney's
fees
obviously
is
not
the
use
of
the
mark
in
commerce
and
i
don't
see
how
the
wording
of
the
act
must
be
stretched
to
cover
attorney's
fees
at
any
kind
of
damages.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
on
the
merits,
in
the
first
trial,
the
trial
judge
--
district
judge,
chief
justice
incidentally
of
this
district
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
without
qualification
or
limitation
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
maier
and
ralphs
--
maier
and
ralphs.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
--
that
that
court
was
not
to
be
bound
by
the
district
court's
finding
as
to
the
likelihood
of
confusion.
it
didn't
disturb
the
finding
that
there
was
no
confusion,
no
damage
and
so
on,
but
it
did
say
that
it
could
independently
determine
the
likelihood
of
future
confusion
by
the
use
of
the
mark.
and
that
that
was,
if
not
a
mix
question,
probably
a
question
of
law.
it
then
determined
that
because
the
products
sold
by
our
parties,
the
respondents
here
was
beer
and
the
trademark
registrant,
had
registered
his
mark
in
connection
with
scotch
whiskey
that
because
they
both
dealt
with
beverages
in
the
alcoholic
fields,
they
were
so
closely
related
that
likelihood
and
confusion
would
result.
and
they
mandated
an
injunction
and
reserved
expressly
only
one
issue
toward
the
district
court
namely
to
have
an
accounting
or
to
determine
the
issues
of
an
accounting.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
as
i
understand
the
accounting,
it's
another
way
of
determining
the
plaintiff's
damages.
some
of
the
cases
seemed
to
say
it's
an
independent
avenue
to
recovery.
but
since
the
controlling
section
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
section
says
there
must
be
an
award
only
of
compensation,
it
would
seem
that
it's
just
another
way
of
determining
the
financial
or
economic
loss
to
the
plaintiff
whether
it's
done
by
proving
loss
of
sales,
that's
conceded
not
the
case
here,
or
injured
the
goodwill
which
is
apparently
also
conceded,
there
would
be
only
the
recovery
of
what
would
be
compensatory
damages.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
no.
and
this
order
was
made
immediately,
i
say,
immediately
was
the
first
step
in
the
case
after
the
mandate
and
the
entry
of
a
responsive
judgment
of
the
district
court
enjoining
future
use
and
then
the
parties
clearing
up
the
odd
quantities
that
were
left
and
reporting
back
to
the
court.
so
this
was
the
first
thing
that
was
done,
to
determine
attorney's
fees.
therefore,
as
it
now
stands
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
there
would
be
no
recovery
of
any
kind,
even
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes
sir.
at
the
time
the
--
shortly
after
the
remand
came
down,
the
plaintiffs
noticed
a
motion
for
judgment
to
conform
to
the
mandate.
and
the
form
of
judgment,
without
any
further
hearing,
any
taking
of
evidence,
it
was
then
entered
and
there
were
no
further
evidences
taken
and
no
additional
findings
of
the
true
sort
may
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
attorney's
fees
were
$60,000
and
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
it
was
arrived
at
by
the
testimony
of
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
on
the
amount,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
the
order
for
attorney's
fees
was
made
without
any
additional
evidence.
and
the
actual
determination
was
heard
and
there
were
experts
on
both
sides
as
well
as
factual
witnesses
and
that's
the
record
we
have
here.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
no,
and
it
was
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
we
felt
we
could
not
take
a
chance
on
it
as
being
treated
as
the
final
order,
so
we
appealed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
premature
because
there
was
no
judgment,
no
final
judgment.
however,
they
undertook
to
consider
the
case
if
the
district
court
made
a
certificate
that
it
was
a
matter
of
general
interests
on
which
there
will
be
a
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
section
1292
of
the
--
of
28
u.s.c.
such
a
certificate
was
made
on
the
application
of
our
parties,
the
respondents
here.
the
district
judge
made
the
certificate,
the
court
then
received
the
case
on
the
then
existing
record
and
the
argument
that
had
been
made.
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
court's
probably
noticed
it
already,
this
was
an
en
banc
hearing
in
the
unanimous
decision.
and
the
case,
the
opinion
i
feel
deals
with
the
issues
we
have
here
so
fully
and
analyzes
the
cases
so
fully
that
would
be
--
and
a
threat
almost
for
me
to
attempt
to
further
back
up
the
court.
i
think
the
court
analyzed
the
case
thoroughly.
as
we
see
it,
this
is
simply
a
question
of
legislative
purpose.
now,
the
congress,
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
knows
how
to
do
this
and
it's
quite
interestingly
i
think,
it
compares
the
copyright
and
patent
laws
where
there
are
some
augmented
provisions
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
and
in
the
patent
situation,
this
court,
a
good
number
of
years
ago,
held
that
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
recovered
in
this
situation
of
a
patent
infringement
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
authority
in
the
acts
of
congress
relating
to
patents.
following
that,
the
congress
did
then
amend
those
acts
to
provide
for
attorney's
fees
in
exceptional
extreme
cases.
it
did
not
do
so
at
anytime
in
connection
with
this
act.
now,
the
legislative
history
according
to
court
of
appeals
is
not
significant.
we're
inclined
to
think
that
it
does
have
some
significance
because
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
immediate
act
which
has
only
been
amended
in
regard
to
the
section
on
damages
and
other
recoveries
than
injunction,
in
a
technical
respect
just
to
correctly
site
two
other
sections
rather
than
the
one
originally
cited.
but
there
had
been
at
least
two
proposals
to
amend
the
act
to
provide
for
attorney's
fees.
and
neither
of
the
proposals
has
succeeded
and
it
would
look
to
us,
and
though
the
congress
had
recognized
that
the
act
did
not
provide
for
attorney's
fees.
and
some
of
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
thought
it
should
be
considered
by
the
congress
and
resulted
in
no
action.
granted
that
that
is
negative,
it
is
nevertheless,
we
feel,
significant.
it
shows
an
awareness
of
the
fact
the
act
does
not
now
provide
in
the
opinion
of
the
proponents
of
such
bills
and
the
fact
that
the
matter
should
be
subject
to
congressional
review.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
the
facts
of
this
case
--
there
could
be
no
recovery
because
all
these
state-generated
issues
had
been
eliminated.
no,
pending
jurisdiction
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
believe
insofar
as
it
dealt
with
--
sure
lanham
act
was
used,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes.
under
the
old
act,
that
--
that
case
involved
unfair
competition
and
other
things
which
we
do
not
have
here.
there
was
no
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
as
i
recall
aladdin
treated
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
as
compensatory
damages
rather
than
exemplary.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
this
sort
of
thing
doesn't
fit,
in
my
idea
at
least,
as
damages,
any
--
unless
we
adopt
the
english
system
or
some
modification
of
it,
attorney's
fees
either
way
are
not
what
we
call
damages.
if
they
are
to
be
awarded
in
the
--
it's
the
antitrust
statutes,
of
course
they're
awarded
because
the
private
plaintiff
is
--
the
private
attorney
general
sometimes
said.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
they're
all
--
they
are
very
expressed
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
--
very
expressed.
now,
i
would
say
that
when
the
court
has
concluded
in
its
review
of
this
record,
it
will
agree
with
this
proposition,
that
if
an
award
is
to
be
upheld
here,
there
would
be
no
other
lanham
act
case
in
which
the
court
would
properly
deny
them.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
they
seem
to
take
the
view
that
the
inherent
powers
of
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
in
equity
matters
somehow
throws
a
cloak
over
as
purely
statutory
proceeding
in
such
ways
to
augment
or
assimilate
some
unstated
power.
our
view
is
that
when
you
have
a
purely
legislative
jurisdiction
and
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
fairly
disputed,
then
you
look
to
the
--
to
the
act
and
since
this
is
a
matter
on
which
the
congress
has
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
doubt
that
there
were
any
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
other
than
on
diversity
grounds.
i
don't
recall
any
historical
examples.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
some
questions
whether
there
would
be
any
federal
common
law
in
this
area.
absent
the
constitutional
authority
to
pass
laws
and
then
an
enactment
by
the
congress
whether
there
would
be
any
substantive
right
within
the
federal
jurisdiction.
the
common
law
of
course
was
approved
--
was
adopted
by
the
states
and
many
of
the
states
have
further
adopted
the
statutes.
now,
i
hope
the
court
will
not
be
concerned
with
what
i
hesitate
to
characterize
as
hyperbole
and
i
particularly
on
the
other
side
and
i
think
they
refer
to
what
i
consider
something
that
court
should
disregard
altogether.
i
was
served
on
the
6th
of
february
with
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
contained
in
it
particularly
at
the
passage
on
page
--
page
14
and
turning
over
to
15,
it's
quite
a
bit
of
material
that
is
both
irrelevant
and
immaterial,
i
think
fairly
might
be
considered
scandalous.
this
is
not
in
this
record.
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
under
review
here
and
i
think
it
abuses
the
privilege
of
advocacy
and
it's
unfair
to
these
respondents.
and
then
conserves
the
late
and
otherwise
it
made
a
motion.
i
hope
the
court
will
disregard
those
remarks
by
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
they
referred
to
a
deposition
of
a
witness
prior
to
the
first
trial
and
state
that
they
are
quoting
from
their
brief
in
the
first
appeal
and
apparently,
trying
to
make
our
people
because
though
they
were
named
pirates
or
something
of
the
sort.
that
is
not
in
this
record.
and
if
it
were
properly
here,
it
would
be
here
and
we
would
have
met
it.
also,
these
statements
are
contrary
to
the
existing
record,
the
testimony
that's
reproduced.
in
that
regard,
this
record
was
prepared
on
stipulation
of
counsel.
i
believe
the
court
has
a
copy
of
our
stipulation.
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
come
here
with
the
records
as
both
so
made
up.
if
there's
any
further
question,
i
would
be
happy
to
respond,
otherwise,
i
believe
the
subject
has
been
covered
from
our
side.
the
court
of
appeals
i
believe
has
done
a
very
thorough
job
of
analysis.
it
should
be
of
real
assistance
to
the
court.
as
we
see
it,
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
and
the
congress
can,
if
it
wishes,
make
any
reasonable
provision
in
this
area.
and
this
legislative
gratefully
as
we
see
it
did
not
intend
to
provide
for
recovery
of
non-taxable
cost
about
$4000
allowed
here
for
that
and
attorney's
fees
in
the
present
form
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
--
i
don't
think
it
impinges
on
equity
powers
of
the
court.
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
could
do
it
when
it's
a
pure
lanham
act
case
as
we
have
here.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
--
i
wasn't
trying
to
wiping
out
any
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
being
a
comprehensive,
all
inclusive
statute
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
there
are
of
course
certain
residual
powers
because
among
other
things,
an
injunction
is
expressly
provided
for
in
--
once
the
proceeding
sections
for
this
one.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
see
no
way
in
which
to
support
it,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
awarding
of
attorney's
fees
is
a
specific
reserved
equity
power.
it
applies
in
equity
cases
such
as
the
sprague
versus
ticonic
bank
where
you
have
the
common
fund
case
there.
you
have
a
two-case
of
unjust
enrichment
if
certain
people
take
advantage
of
the
expense
and
efforts
of
others
and
share
equally
with
them.
but
as
i
see
it,
that
--
an
equitable
remedy
is
just
something
that
the
court
can
utilize
if
it
otherwise
has
authority
to
act.
in
other
words,
as
i
see
it,
equity
does
not
create
substantive
rights
but
it
deals
with
remedies
and
always
had
originally
to
catch
the
conscience
of
the
king
when
he
have
the
final
say
later
to
temper
the
harshness
of
the
common
law.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
the
court,
i
believe,
determined
that
first
there
was
no
such
power
in
equity
or
elsewhere
under
a
pure
lanham
act
case
to
award
attorney's
fees
and
that's
what
we
have
with
the
pure
lanham
act
case.
they
didn't
go
into
the
other
phases
of
it
and
i
think
that's
the
meaning
when
they
said
primarily
because
the
act
does
not
provide
for
them.
now,
all
of
the
arguments
that
didn't
made
here
in
the
briefs
were
made
through
the
court
of
appeals
in
respect
to
why
whether
the
act
is
applied
or
not,
award
is
correct.
so
those
things
were
rather
exhaustibly
presented
by
the
respondent
--
the
appellees
there
and
the
petitioners
here.
well,
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
had
those
points
before
them.
we
have,
of
course,
argued
as
we
do
here
that
we're
dealing
with
the
statutory
matter
and
that
these
other
matters
were
only
secondarily
involved
in
the
event
that
was
to
--
to
the
contrary
of
our
intention.
we
did
attempt
there
as
we
have
briefly
attempted
to
do
in
our
brief
here
to
point
out
that
there
were
none
of
the
things
in
this
case
which
would
normally
invoke
any
extraordinary
equity
remedy
even
if
the
other
theory
were
adopted.
i
might
say
that
as
we
see
it,
the
request
of
the
petitioners
here
should
not
be
granted
as
to
requiring
even
if
we're
entirely
wrong
that
the
court
carry
out
its
judgment
because
we've
reserved
all
of
the
issues
as
to
the
proper
amount
as
well
as
all
of
the
evidentiary
support
issues.
they
were
not
passed
to
form
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
as
we
see
it
if
--
if
we
are
mistaken
about
the
lanham
act
and
general
principles,
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
before
the
proceedings
in
any
event,
and
this
is
the
question
i'll
refer
to
in
my
associate.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondents
submit,
if
i
may
first
outline
our
view
of
the
matter,
that
first,
we
have
eliminated
all
state
issues
of
unfair
competition.
it
was
eliminated
by
earlier
opinions
in
the
case
which
are
now
final
and
binding
on
all
parties.
there
is
no
question
of
misrepresentation
coming
on
advertising,
discouragement,
or
injury.
there
are
no
damages.
and
at
the
time
this
was
made,
there
was
no
accounting.
the
first
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
particularly
held
that
they
were
going
to
decide
the
case
and
did
so
entirely
on
the
lanham
act
dealing
with
what
appears
to
be
the
delusion
theory
as
i
read
some
of
the
cases
and
comments,
but
they
spelled
it
out
in
that
opinion
as
anticipation
of
future
confusion.
it
is
a
--
an
unqualified
and
unreversed,
uncriticized
finding
of
the
district
court
in
the
trial.
there
was
only
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
no
confusion.
we
therefore
have
the
case
limited
strictly
within
the
confines
of
the
lanham
act.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
as
i
understand
the
lanham
act
provision
which
is
section
1117
of
the
u.s.
code
36
as
i
believe
is
the
lanham
act
section,
the
court
may
award
compensation,
actual
damages
which
can
be
measured
by
either
one
or
perhaps
and
i'm
not
certain
about
this,
a
combination
of
two
measures.
the
actual
damages
and
those
are
the
words
used
in
the
section
separated
by
the
trademark
plaintiff,
and
an
accounting
of
the
profits
of
the
infringer
and
accounting
on
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
--
that
can
get
one
or
both
or
perhaps
its
one
recovery.
the
act
then
provides
that
the
court
may
allow
additional
amounts
up
to
three
times
the
amount
of
actual
damages.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
up
to
three
times
the
actual
damages
as
determined
by
either
one
of
these
methods
or
a
combination
of
them.
the
act,
however,
has
a
very
specific
provision
in
the
same
section
which
says
that
all
such
awards
must
be
--
shall
constitute
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
exactly,
“shall
constitute
compensation
and
not
a
penalty”.
now,
there's
another
factor
which
i
think
is
raised
by
the
question.
all
of
these
damages
must
come
from
the
act
of
the
infringer
that
is
described
as
actionable
in
the
earlier
section,
which
is
in
the
code
1114,
and
it
there
provides
that
this
use
must
be
in
commerce.
in
other
words,
as
we
read
it,
no
damages
of
any
kind
or
nature
can
be
recovered
unless
the
acts
that
are
complained
of
occurred
in
interstate
of
foreign
commerce
by
the
use
of
the
mark
which
is
registered.
if
that
is
so
then,
attorney's
fees
obviously
is
not
the
use
of
the
mark
in
commerce
and
i
don't
see
how
the
wording
of
the
act
must
be
stretched
to
cover
attorney's
fees
at
any
kind
of
damages.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
on
the
merits,
in
the
first
trial,
the
trial
judge
--
district
judge,
chief
justice
incidentally
of
this
district
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
without
qualification
or
limitation
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
maier
and
ralphs
--
maier
and
ralphs.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
--
that
that
court
was
not
to
be
bound
by
the
district
court's
finding
as
to
the
likelihood
of
confusion.
it
didn't
disturb
the
finding
that
there
was
no
confusion,
no
damage
and
so
on,
but
it
did
say
that
it
could
independently
determine
the
likelihood
of
future
confusion
by
the
use
of
the
mark.
and
that
that
was,
if
not
a
mix
question,
probably
a
question
of
law.
it
then
determined
that
because
the
products
sold
by
our
parties,
the
respondents
here
was
beer
and
the
trademark
registrant,
had
registered
his
mark
in
connection
with
scotch
whiskey
that
because
they
both
dealt
with
beverages
in
the
alcoholic
fields,
they
were
so
closely
related
that
likelihood
and
confusion
would
result.
and
they
mandated
an
injunction
and
reserved
expressly
only
one
issue
toward
the
district
court
namely
to
have
an
accounting
or
to
determine
the
issues
of
an
accounting.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
as
i
understand
the
accounting,
it's
another
way
of
determining
the
plaintiff's
damages.
some
of
the
cases
seemed
to
say
it's
an
independent
avenue
to
recovery.
but
since
the
controlling
section
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
section
says
there
must
be
an
award
only
of
compensation,
it
would
seem
that
it's
just
another
way
of
determining
the
financial
or
economic
loss
to
the
plaintiff
whether
it's
done
by
proving
loss
of
sales,
that's
conceded
not
the
case
here,
or
injured
the
goodwill
which
is
apparently
also
conceded,
there
would
be
only
the
recovery
of
what
would
be
compensatory
damages.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
no.
and
this
order
was
made
immediately,
i
say,
immediately
was
the
first
step
in
the
case
after
the
mandate
and
the
entry
of
a
responsive
judgment
of
the
district
court
enjoining
future
use
and
then
the
parties
clearing
up
the
odd
quantities
that
were
left
and
reporting
back
to
the
court.
so
this
was
the
first
thing
that
was
done,
to
determine
attorney's
fees.
therefore,
as
it
now
stands
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
there
would
be
no
recovery
of
any
kind,
even
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes
sir.
at
the
time
the
--
shortly
after
the
remand
came
down,
the
plaintiffs
noticed
a
motion
for
judgment
to
conform
to
the
mandate.
and
the
form
of
judgment,
without
any
further
hearing,
any
taking
of
evidence,
it
was
then
entered
and
there
were
no
further
evidences
taken
and
no
additional
findings
of
the
true
sort
may
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
attorney's
fees
were
$60,000
and
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
it
was
arrived
at
by
the
testimony
of
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
on
the
amount,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
the
order
for
attorney's
fees
was
made
without
any
additional
evidence.
and
the
actual
determination
was
heard
and
there
were
experts
on
both
sides
as
well
as
factual
witnesses
and
that's
the
record
we
have
here.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
no,
and
it
was
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
we
felt
we
could
not
take
a
chance
on
it
as
being
treated
as
the
final
order,
so
we
appealed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
premature
because
there
was
no
judgment,
no
final
judgment.
however,
they
undertook
to
consider
the
case
if
the
district
court
made
a
certificate
that
it
was
a
matter
of
general
interests
on
which
there
will
be
a
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
section
1292
of
the
--
of
28
u.s.c.
such
a
certificate
was
made
on
the
application
of
our
parties,
the
respondents
here.
the
district
judge
made
the
certificate,
the
court
then
received
the
case
on
the
then
existing
record
and
the
argument
that
had
been
made.
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
court's
probably
noticed
it
already,
this
was
an
en
banc
hearing
in
the
unanimous
decision.
and
the
case,
the
opinion
i
feel
deals
with
the
issues
we
have
here
so
fully
and
analyzes
the
cases
so
fully
that
would
be
--
and
a
threat
almost
for
me
to
attempt
to
further
back
up
the
court.
i
think
the
court
analyzed
the
case
thoroughly.
as
we
see
it,
this
is
simply
a
question
of
legislative
purpose.
now,
the
congress,
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
knows
how
to
do
this
and
it's
quite
interestingly
i
think,
it
compares
the
copyright
and
patent
laws
where
there
are
some
augmented
provisions
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
and
in
the
patent
situation,
this
court,
a
good
number
of
years
ago,
held
that
attorney's
fees
could
not
be
recovered
in
this
situation
of
a
patent
infringement
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
authority
in
the
acts
of
congress
relating
to
patents.
following
that,
the
congress
did
then
amend
those
acts
to
provide
for
attorney's
fees
in
exceptional
extreme
cases.
it
did
not
do
so
at
anytime
in
connection
with
this
act.
now,
the
legislative
history
according
to
court
of
appeals
is
not
significant.
we're
inclined
to
think
that
it
does
have
some
significance
because
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
immediate
act
which
has
only
been
amended
in
regard
to
the
section
on
damages
and
other
recoveries
than
injunction,
in
a
technical
respect
just
to
correctly
site
two
other
sections
rather
than
the
one
originally
cited.
but
there
had
been
at
least
two
proposals
to
amend
the
act
to
provide
for
attorney's
fees.
and
neither
of
the
proposals
has
succeeded
and
it
would
look
to
us,
and
though
the
congress
had
recognized
that
the
act
did
not
provide
for
attorney's
fees.
and
some
of
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
thought
it
should
be
considered
by
the
congress
and
resulted
in
no
action.
granted
that
that
is
negative,
it
is
nevertheless,
we
feel,
significant.
it
shows
an
awareness
of
the
fact
the
act
does
not
now
provide
in
the
opinion
of
the
proponents
of
such
bills
and
the
fact
that
the
matter
should
be
subject
to
congressional
review.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
the
facts
of
this
case
--
there
could
be
no
recovery
because
all
these
state-generated
issues
had
been
eliminated.
no,
pending
jurisdiction
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
believe
insofar
as
it
dealt
with
--
sure
lanham
act
was
used,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes.
under
the
old
act,
that
--
that
case
involved
unfair
competition
and
other
things
which
we
do
not
have
here.
there
was
no
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
as
i
recall
aladdin
treated
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
as
compensatory
damages
rather
than
exemplary.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
this
sort
of
thing
doesn't
fit,
in
my
idea
at
least,
as
damages,
any
--
unless
we
adopt
the
english
system
or
some
modification
of
it,
attorney's
fees
either
way
are
not
what
we
call
damages.
if
they
are
to
be
awarded
in
the
--
it's
the
antitrust
statutes,
of
course
they're
awarded
because
the
private
plaintiff
is
--
the
private
attorney
general
sometimes
said.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
they're
all
--
they
are
very
expressed
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
--
very
expressed.
now,
i
would
say
that
when
the
court
has
concluded
in
its
review
of
this
record,
it
will
agree
with
this
proposition,
that
if
an
award
is
to
be
upheld
here,
there
would
be
no
other
lanham
act
case
in
which
the
court
would
properly
deny
them.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
they
seem
to
take
the
view
that
the
inherent
powers
of
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
in
equity
matters
somehow
throws
a
cloak
over
as
purely
statutory
proceeding
in
such
ways
to
augment
or
assimilate
some
unstated
power.
our
view
is
that
when
you
have
a
purely
legislative
jurisdiction
and
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
fairly
disputed,
then
you
look
to
the
--
to
the
act
and
since
this
is
a
matter
on
which
the
congress
has
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
doubt
that
there
were
any
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
other
than
on
diversity
grounds.
i
don't
recall
any
historical
examples.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
some
questions
whether
there
would
be
any
federal
common
law
in
this
area.
absent
the
constitutional
authority
to
pass
laws
and
then
an
enactment
by
the
congress
whether
there
would
be
any
substantive
right
within
the
federal
jurisdiction.
the
common
law
of
course
was
approved
--
was
adopted
by
the
states
and
many
of
the
states
have
further
adopted
the
statutes.
now,
i
hope
the
court
will
not
be
concerned
with
what
i
hesitate
to
characterize
as
hyperbole
and
i
particularly
on
the
other
side
and
i
think
they
refer
to
what
i
consider
something
that
court
should
disregard
altogether.
i
was
served
on
the
6th
of
february
with
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
contained
in
it
particularly
at
the
passage
on
page
--
page
14
and
turning
over
to
15,
it's
quite
a
bit
of
material
that
is
both
irrelevant
and
immaterial,
i
think
fairly
might
be
considered
scandalous.
this
is
not
in
this
record.
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
under
review
here
and
i
think
it
abuses
the
privilege
of
advocacy
and
it's
unfair
to
these
respondents.
and
then
conserves
the
late
and
otherwise
it
made
a
motion.
i
hope
the
court
will
disregard
those
remarks
by
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
they
referred
to
a
deposition
of
a
witness
prior
to
the
first
trial
and
state
that
they
are
quoting
from
their
brief
in
the
first
appeal
and
apparently,
trying
to
make
our
people
because
though
they
were
named
pirates
or
something
of
the
sort.
that
is
not
in
this
record.
and
if
it
were
properly
here,
it
would
be
here
and
we
would
have
met
it.
also,
these
statements
are
contrary
to
the
existing
record,
the
testimony
that's
reproduced.
in
that
regard,
this
record
was
prepared
on
stipulation
of
counsel.
i
believe
the
court
has
a
copy
of
our
stipulation.
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
come
here
with
the
records
as
both
so
made
up.
if
there's
any
further
question,
i
would
be
happy
to
respond,
otherwise,
i
believe
the
subject
has
been
covered
from
our
side.
the
court
of
appeals
i
believe
has
done
a
very
thorough
job
of
analysis.
it
should
be
of
real
assistance
to
the
court.
as
we
see
it,
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
and
the
congress
can,
if
it
wishes,
make
any
reasonable
provision
in
this
area.
and
this
legislative
gratefully
as
we
see
it
did
not
intend
to
provide
for
recovery
of
non-taxable
cost
about
$4000
allowed
here
for
that
and
attorney's
fees
in
the
present
form
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
--
i
don't
think
it
impinges
on
equity
powers
of
the
court.
the
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
could
do
it
when
it's
a
pure
lanham
act
case
as
we
have
here.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
--
i
wasn't
trying
to
wiping
out
any
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
yes,
being
a
comprehensive,
all
inclusive
statute
--
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
there
are
of
course
certain
residual
powers
because
among
other
things,
an
injunction
is
expressly
provided
for
in
--
once
the
proceeding
sections
for
this
one.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
i
see
no
way
in
which
to
support
it,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
awarding
of
attorney's
fees
is
a
specific
reserved
equity
power.
it
applies
in
equity
cases
such
as
the
sprague
versus
ticonic
bank
where
you
have
the
common
fund
case
there.
you
have
a
two-case
of
unjust
enrichment
if
certain
people
take
advantage
of
the
expense
and
efforts
of
others
and
share
equally
with
them.
but
as
i
see
it,
that
--
an
equitable
remedy
is
just
something
that
the
court
can
utilize
if
it
otherwise
has
authority
to
act.
in
other
words,
as
i
see
it,
equity
does
not
create
substantive
rights
but
it
deals
with
remedies
and
always
had
originally
to
catch
the
conscience
of
the
king
when
he
have
the
final
say
later
to
temper
the
harshness
of
the
common
law.
mr.
j.
albert
hutchinson
well,
the
court,
i
believe,
determined
that
first
there
was
no
such
power
in
equity
or
elsewhere
under
a
pure
lanham
act
case
to
award
attorney's
fees
and
that's
what
we
have
with
the
pure
lanham
act
case.
they
didn't
go
into
the
other
phases
of
it
and
i
think
that's
the
meaning
when
they
said
primarily
because
the
act
does
not
provide
for
them.
now,
all
of
the
arguments
that
didn't
made
here
in
the
briefs
were
made
through
the
court
of
appeals
in
respect
to
why
whether
the
act
is
applied
or
not,
award
is
correct.
so
those
things
were
rather
exhaustibly
presented
by
the
respondent
--
the
appellees
there
and
the
petitioners
here.
well,
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
had
those
points
before
them.
we
have,
of
course,
argued
as
we
do
here
that
we're
dealing
with
the
statutory
matter
and
that
these
other
matters
were
only
secondarily
involved
in
the
event
that
was
to
--
to
the
contrary
of
our
intention.
we
did
attempt
there
as
we
have
briefly
attempted
to
do
in
our
brief
here
to
point
out
that
there
were
none
of
the
things
in
this
case
which
would
normally
invoke
any
extraordinary
equity
remedy
even
if
the
other
theory
were
adopted.
i
might
say
that
as
we
see
it,
the
request
of
the
petitioners
here
should
not
be
granted
as
to
requiring
even
if
we're
entirely
wrong
that
the
court
carry
out
its
judgment
because
we've
reserved
all
of
the
issues
as
to
the
proper
amount
as
well
as
all
of
the
evidentiary
support
issues.
they
were
not
passed
to
form
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
as
we
see
it
if
--
if
we
are
mistaken
about
the
lanham
act
and
general
principles,
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
before
the
proceedings
in
any
event,
and
this
is
the
question
i'll
refer
to
in
my
associate.
