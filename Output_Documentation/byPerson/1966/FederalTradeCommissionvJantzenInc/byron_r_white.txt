justice
byron
r.
white
because
you've
--
but
as
mr.
justice
clarke
suggested
they
start
all
over
on
the,
at
the
complaint
stage
now
you
can
litigate
that
compliant,
you
need
to
concept
to
anything,
you
did
concept
for,
and
a
commission
would
have
establish
every
element
of
the
whole
case
i
take
it
that's
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what
you
say
they
should
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
i
understand
you'd
rather
they
didn't
do
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
are
you
into
it,
i
would
think
it's
the
only
other
side
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
really
wanted
to
do
the
government's
work
for
it
in
the
sense
that
you
think
the
government
should
have
a
more
effective
[inaudible]
against
us
than
they
are
claiming?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
may
no
longer
predicate
an
enforcement
action
on
those
order
that's
one
thing
that
--
you
say
that
statute
definitely
very
definitely
eliminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
true
if
you
do
say
that
those
orders
are
not
–
can
be
debated
further
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
it
really
is
a
practical
consideration
in
a
consent
order
case?
now
let's
just
assume
that,
let's
just
assume
that
now
the
act
has
been
passed,
and
the
commission
started
a
proceeding,
an
enforcement
proceeding
against
you
and
what
if
they've
noticed
at
a
hearing
in
proof
that
you
had
violated
the
terms
of
this
consent
order
and
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you
think
you,
what
would
be
open
for
you
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
this
is
a,
this
was
a
consent
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
assume
you
are
right
and
the
commission
had
to
start
a
new
proceeding
and
it
was
to
start
with
the
facts
which
it
says
were
established
under
the
old
proceeding
in
which
you
suggest
a
res
judicata.
do
you
think
that
really
correct
under
consent
order
arrangement?
do
you
there
are
any
facts
with
which
the,
which
the
commission
can
start
with
as
established
and
which
you
may
not
challenge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
just
say
that
the
previous
order
then
stands
for
nothing
as
far
as
having
established
any
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
don't
agree
with
commissioner
elanor?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
and
i
didn't
think
so.
