[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
if
they
may
maintain
an
action
on
the
old
order
based
on
your
sections
and
violations
of
the
old
order
would
they
not
ensue
a
court
order
of
course
no
sanction
has
been
proposed
on
the
initial
violation
on
the
old
proceedings,
but
there
now
would
be
a
court
order,
would
there
not,
based
on
the
old
order
and
on
your
concession
of
this
violation
will
they
not
get
a
court
order
under
the
old
procedure?
mr.
justice
bernnan
isn't
that
what's
all,
isn't
that
what
happened?
mr.
justice
bernnan
under
the
old
procedure
your
concession
of
violation
of
the
old
pre
1959
order
would
result
in
the
court
order,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
enjoining
compliance.
mr.
justice
bernnan
why
not?
mr.
justice
bernnan
wouldn't
the,
i
thought
what
would
happen
in
the
situation
as
you
describe
is
your
case,
would
it
been
an
order
and
joining
enforcement
that
is
in
enforcing
the
issue
of
commission
order
in
the
form
of
an
adjoining
your
compliance
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
don't
–
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
mechanical
but
when
you
concede
that
you
have
violated
i
will
suppose
that
would
happen.
well
assume
with
me
that's
what
would
happen.
now
you
are
saying
the
1959
statute
for
appeal,
the
old
–
well,
or
the
old
procedure
they
can't
do
that.
they
have
to
start
a
brand
new
proceeding
all
over
again,
a
brand
new
complaint,
then
get
an
order
which
then
becomes
enforceable
under
new
the
procedure,
isn't
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
you
don't
think
that's
a
very
different
situation?
mr.
