justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
if
your
argument
comes
down
to
this
that
the
act
of
congress
not
merely
prescribed
a
procedure
to
be
followed
in
the
future
but
obliterated
all
ftc
orders
that
had
occurred
before
the
act
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
obliterate
--
that
it
obliterated
to
the
extent
of
requiring
the
commission
is
not
a
new
proceeding,
the
court
could
do
anything
against
that
particular
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
all
the
other
were
wiped
out--
i
mean
all
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
be
the
same
as
though
the
congress
come
along
and
said
on
all
those
proceedings
they
have
done
that
no
value
will
be
taken
into
account
by
the
ftc?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
everything
with
the
order
of
enforcement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
commissioner
eleanor
would
then
be
in
minority,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
have
to
start
a
new
proceeding
and
go
all
the
way
for
a
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
you
face
in
that
effect
in
which
you
say
one
problem
with
this
was
to
provide
that
none
of
those
old
orders
should
be
included
in
future?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
argued
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
you
think,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
congress
did
was
to
wipe
out
the
effectiveness
of
the
old
order,
these
400
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
what
they
--
isn't
that
what
you're
insisting
that
we've
done
here,
maybe
you've
tried,
i
am
not,
it
seems
to
me
like
--
i
guess
on
the
basis
that
you
are
stating?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
orders
are
wiped
out,
aren't
they?
under
your
argument
can
the
government
proceed
on
any
of
those
old
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
proceed
under
any
of
those
old
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
all,
what
about
all
the
others,
can't
they
all
be
wiped
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
effectiveness
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
they
start
a
new
proceeding
without
any
summons
or
notice
or
evidence
or
conclusion,
facts
of
any
kind,
they
can
issue
an
order,
they
can
just
automatically
issue
an
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
bringing
up
a
lot
of
hypothetical
cases
rather
than
facing
the
fact
and
i
may
be
wrong
with
that,
i
may
misunderstand
rather
than
facing
the
fact
that
what
you
ask
is
that
we
construe
this
act
of
congress
in
wiping
out
the
effectiveness
of
a
certain
number
of
the
old
orders
issued
by
the
commission
under
the
old
proceedings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
order
disappears
you
mean,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
the
order
disappeared?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
they
have
just
started
new
procedure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
wider
procedure,
isn't
that
quite
something
to
be
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
document
that's
lost
its
stinger?
justice
