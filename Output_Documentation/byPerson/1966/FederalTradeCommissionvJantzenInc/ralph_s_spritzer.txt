mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
legal
status
of
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
order
in
question
was
issued
in
january
of
1959
and
the
date
is
important
here,
issued
upon
the
consent
of
the
respondent
jantzen.
in
substance
the
order
directed
the
jantzen
to
cease-and-desist
from
further
discrimination
in
advertising
and
promotional
allowances
granted
its
customers,
a
form
of
discrimination
covered
by
section
2(d)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
your
honor
it
was
a
consent
order.
and
the
only
statutory
problem
which
is
here
results
from
the
fact
that
later
in
that
same
year
1959,
specifically
in
july,
the
clayton
act
was
amended
so
as
to
provide
both
new
and
strengthened
methods
of
enforcement
of
cease-and-desist
orders.
now
respondent
contends
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
agreed
that
a
practical
consequence
albeit
an
inadvertent
one
of
this
amendment
was
to
make
the
preexisting
january
1959
order
wholly
unenforceable
and
it
consequently
acknowledged
violations
of
this
1959
order,
violations
which
were
found
some
years
later
in
1964
cannot
be
reached
through
the
1959
cease-and-desist
order.
we
urge
of
course
that
this
was
not
an
intended
result,
a
point
on
which
there
appears
to
be
little
if
any
basis
for
dispute
and
that
it
is
not
a
result
which
is
required
by
the
amendatory
language.
we
make
the
further
i
would
say
complementary
argument
that
if
the
amendment
should
be
read
as
creating
a
gap
and
leaving
this
former
order
unenforceable,
then
we
say
alternatively
that
gap
would
be
filled
by
the
general
savings
statute
1
usc
109.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
expected
parochial
language
it
said
perhaps
inadvertent.
i
am
going
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
and
that
plainly
congress
thought
it
was
protecting
and
strengthening
the
act.
it
also
made
reference
in
the
committee
report
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
to
numerous
compliance
investigations
which
the
commission
had
underway
and
there's
not
a
whisper
in
the
entire
history
that
congress
thought
it
was
going
to
make
any
orders
unenforceable.
so
i
think
there
is
little
basis
at
least
for
any
suggestion
that
congress
thought
this
result
was
going
to
fallout.
i
might
note
incidentally
that
the
second
circuit
has
reasonable
come
out
in
direct
opposition
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
and
that
in
earlier
--
at
an
earlier
date
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
had
indicated
although
that
precise
issue
was
not
before
it
for
a
decision
that
it
excepted
the
commission's
view
which
i
shall
explain
as
i
go
along
that
the
old
orders
continue
to
be
enforced
by
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
printed
it
since
it's
not
available
in
the
reports
in
the
supplemental
memorandum
that
your
honor
should
have.
now
before
i
attempt
to
develop
our
arguments,
let
me
seek
if
i
may
to
clarify
the
issue
by
recalling
to
your
honors'
the
pre-1959
procedures
and
then
comparing
them
to
the
procedures
for
judicial
review
and
enforcement
as
provided
in
1959
by
the
so
called
finality
act
of
1959.
now
prior
to
that
year,
clayton
act
orders,
cease
and
desist
orders
could
come
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
one
of
two
ways.
the
party
subject
to
the
order
could
bring
a
review
proceeding
to
set
it
aside
or
to
modify
it.
there
was
no
period
of
limitations
prior
to
1959
so
that
the
order
might
stand
for
years
and
then
ultimately
a
review
proceeding
might
be
instituted.
the
next
paragraph
of
the
old
statute
provided
that
the
commission
for
its
part
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
to
seek
enforcement,
but
it
was
only
entitled
to
enforcement
if
it
could
show
two
things.
first
that
it's
cease
and
desist
order
was
valid
and
second
that
its
order
had
been
violated
since
it
had
been
issued,
in
other
words
it
had
to
show
a
post
order
violation,
a
second
act.
sanctions
attached
only
if
an
order
of
enforcement
was
obtained
and
a
third
violation
thereafter
shown
at
which
point
of
course
the
contempt
power
of
court
of
appeals
would
be
available.
now
as
i've
indicated
accordingly
there
might
be
--
there
might
have
been
under
the
1953
--
pre-1959
procedures
two
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals
preliminary
to
a
decree
enforcing
the
commission's
order,
the
one
proceeding
by
the
responded
company
seeking
review
of
the
order,
the
other
proceeding
by
the
commission
seeking
enforcement.
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
respondent's
appeal
that
the
order
was
valid
did
not
automatically
carry
enforcement
with
it.
indeed
this
court
made
it
clear
in
the
old
ruberoid
decision
that
even
if
a
commission
order
was
affirmed
that
enforcement
would
not
follow
unless
in
addition
violation,
post
order
violation
was
shown.
now
these
old
procedures
as
i've
outlined
initially
applied
both
to
orders
issued
under
the
clayton
act
and
to
orders
issued
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
both
of
which
statutes
of
course
were
roughly
contemporaneous.
they
were
cumbersome
and
in
1938
congress
changed
them
so
far
as
cease
and
desist
orders
issued
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
were
concerned.
that
was
done
by
the
so
called
wheeler-lea
amendments
and
in
large
part
though
not
in
toto,
the
finality
act
of
1959
or
clayton
act
orders
what
the
wheeler-lea
amendments
had
done
in
1938
for
federal
trade
commission
act
orders.
and
the
new
procedures
brought
into
the
law
by
wheeler-lea
can
be
simply
stated.
it
provided
that
if
an
order
issued
under
the
trade
commission
act
was
not
appealed
within
60
days,
it
would
become
final.
if
it
were
appealed
within
that
60-day
period,
it
would
become
final
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
review
proceedings.
under
this
scheme,
the
wheeler-lea
scheme
final
orders
were
equipped
with
teeth.
violation
of
any
such
final
order
would
carry
civil
penalties.
now
there
were
numerous
cease
and
desist
orders
outstanding
when
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
was
passed
too
and
the
happily
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
made
some
specific
provision
for
that
which
the
statute,
we
are
dealing
with
today
did
not
make.
wheeler-lea
in
a
separate
section
said
that
all
federal
trade
commission
act
orders
which
had
not
already
been
taken
to
the
courts
would
become
final
if
the
private
party
affected
by
that
order
did
not
seek
judicial
review
within
60
days
of
the
enactment
of
the
new
enforcement
procedure.
and
as
a
result
all
federal
trade
commission
act
orders
would
become
final
and
self
executing
either
by
the
failure
of
the
party
to
seek
judicial
review
within
the
60
days
allowed
by
the
statute
or
if
he
did
seek
review
by
his
failure
to
sustain
it's
challenge.
now,
the
commission
sought
similar
legislation
in
relation
to
clayton
act
cease-and-desist
orders
over
a
period
of
years
and
various
bills
differing
somewhat
in
their
details
were
sporadically
introduced.
it
was
not
until
1959
that
the
comparable
legislation
was
adopted.
i
say
comparable
because
there
are
some
differences
and
those
differences
do
concern
us
in
this
litigation.
first
very
briefly
as
to
the
similarities;
the
finality
act
of
1959
like
the
wheeler-lea
amendments
upon
which
it
was
patterned,
substituted
new,
review
and
enforcement
procedures
for
the
old.
just
like
wheeler-lea
it
provided
that
the
clayton
act
orders
would
become
final
60-days
after
service
upon
the
respondent
company
unless
judicial
review
were
sought
and
further
of
course
if
review
were
thought
they
would
become
final
to
the
extent
sustained
upon
the
completion
of
the
review
proceeding.
again
like
wheeler-lea,
it
provided
that
final
clayton
act
orders
would
be
self
executing
and
would
carry
penalties
also
that
they
might
be
imports
through
the
injunction
process.
in
short
then
so
for
as
clayton
act
orders
issued
after
july
1959
are
concerned
one
may
say
that
the
wheeler-lea
and
the
clayton
act
and
the
finality
act
procedures
are
for
all
practical
purpose
is
same.
now
wheeler-lea
as
i
indicated
earlier
contained
this
separate
section
which
provided
in
substance
that
in
the
case
of
an
already
outstanding
order
the
respondent
would
have
60
days
to
go
to
court
and
failing
that
the
order
would
become
final.
the
finality
act
which
was
senator
sparkman's
senate
bill
enacted
in
the
law,
adopted
a
different
approach
for
already
outstanding
orders
than
it
adopted
cease-and-desist
orders
thereafter
to
be
issued.
section
2
of
the
finality
act
which
appears
at
page
39
in
the
government's
brief,
states
that
the
review
and
enforcement
procedures
provided
by
the
new
statute
and
the
amendments
made
by
section
1
shall
have
no
application
to
any
proceedings
initiated
before
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act,
and
then
it
goes
on,
that
each
such
proceeding
shall
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
such
section
as
they
existed
on
the
day
preceding
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act.
thus
the
statute
tells
us
quite
explicitly
that
if
a
court
of
appeals
proceeding
involving
the
cease-and-desist
order
in
this
case
had
been
pending,
when
the
finality
act
was
passed
in
july
1959
that
the
old
procedures
would
govern
and
that
the
commission
could
seek
enforcement
in
the
case
of
post
order
violation.
what
the
statute
fails
to
tell
us
in
terms,
is
what
procedures
are
to
govern
cease-and-desist
orders
issued
prior
to
july
of
1959,
in
relation
to
which
no
proceeding
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
of
july
1959
and
that
of
course
is
the
factual
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
-â€“
substituted
new
review
and
enforcement
procedures
for
the
old
and
that
these
were
prospective
in
their
operation,
they
were
going
to
govern
all
orders
thereafter
issued.
the
statute
also
explicitly
provided
that
in
respect
of
any
proceeding
that
was
already
in
court,
the
earlier
pre
1959
procedures
would
govern.
jantzen
argues
the
congress
repealed
the
old
provisions
except
in
so
for
as
it
enacted
an
explicit
savings
provision
and
that
in
consequence
there
is
a
gap
because
although
congress
provided
for
the
continuance
of
the
old
methods
of
enforcement
in
respect
to
cases
already
pending
in
court,
it
did
not
in
terms
provide
any
method
of
enforcement
in
respect
of
pre-1959
cease-and-desist
orders
which
had
not
yet
been
taken
to
court.
it
seems
hardly
likely
that
congress
engaged
as
this
congress
was
in
urging
of
sponsor
in
strengthening
and
protecting
the
act
would
have
knowingly
discarded
the
vast
majority
of
the
cease-and-desist
orders
and
cast
them
in
limbo
making
them
a
wholly
unenforceable.
in
fact
when
the
1959
legislation
was
passed,
there
were
some
440
clayton
act
cease-and-desist
orders
outstanding,
some
50
of
which
have
been
affirmed
or
enforced
and
in
additional
11
then
pending
on
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
respondent's
argument
would
mean
that
the
remaining
379
orders
with
many
of
them
entered
after
protracted
and
strenuously
contested
proceedings
would
be
unenforceable.
i
think
it's
been
conceivable
that
congress
would
have
knowingly
discarded
this
large
number
of
orders
without
even
a
whisper
in
the
entire
legislative
history
and
there
is
none
of
this
is
what
it
was
about
or
this
is
what
it
intended.
i
think
it
also
offends
the
commonsense
considerably
to
suppose
that
congress
would
make
explicit
provision
for
commission
of
enforcement
of
an
order
which
is
then
being
challenged
in
the
courts
but
makes
no
allowance
whatever
for
the
commission
to
enforce
an
order
which
has
not
even
been
questioned,
but
yet
that
would
be
the
consequence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yeah,
in
terms
it
does.
there
is
clearly
a
inartful
drafting,
assuming
that
i
am
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
saying
that
this
was
unintended.
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
have
concluded
that
the
obvious
congressional
purpose
here
was
to
make
the
old
procedures
applicable
to
pre
1959
orders
and
the
new
procedures
prospective
only.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir,
i
certainly
sir.
as
i
said
both
those
circuits
have
concluded
that
the
obvious
purpose
was
to
make
the
new
provisions
prospective
and
those
courts
have
concluded
that
the
statute
can
fairly
be
read
in
light
of
it's
obvious
purpose
as
repealing
the
old
provisions
for
enforcement
only
and
respect
of
orders
thereafter
issued
by
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
has
shortly
after
the
finality
act
was
passed
in
its
sperry
rand
case
that
the
new
statute
was
prospective
only
and
that
all
pre-1959
orders
where
to
be
enforced
by
the
old
statute.
judge
fayes
suggested
in
that
opinion
that
the
explanation
of
the
rather
limited
language
used
the
reference
only
to
cases
pending
in
the
courts
may
have
been
prompted
by
the
dealing
on
the
part
of
congress
that
otherwise
some
doubts
might
exist
about
proceedings
which
were
in
litigation.
in
all
events
the
commission
duly
advised
as
a
result
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
litigation
that
the
new
statute
was
prospective
only
directed
an
investigation
and
i'm
now
returning
to
the
particulars
of
this
case.
in
1964
to
determine
whether
respondent
jantzen
was
in
compliance
with
the
old
1959
order.
jantzen
acknowledged
in
that
commission
proceeding
that
it
had
violated
the
order
and
indeed
it
stipulated
two,
three
instances
of
violation.
the
commission
thereupon
filed
a
petition
for
a
court
order
adjoining
compliance
and
at
that
point
jantzen
objected
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
because
on
a
strictly
literal
reading
of
the
statute
one
might
say
there
was
a
gap.
i've
indicated
already
i
think
that
we
believe
the
other
circuits
that
have
viewed
this
matter
are
correct
in
believing
that
one
may
read
into
this
language
a
continuation
of
the
statute
not
only
for
pending
cases,
but
for
all
of
cases
including
those
in
which
the
respondent
hadn't
even
challenged
the
order.
this
brings
me
and
i
shall
treat
it
only
very
briefly
to
the
alternative
argument
which
we
think
is
a
sound
one
if
there
is
any
--
if
the
court
finds
occasion
to
reach
it
and
that
is
the
argument
that
if
the
finality
act
were
read
as
leaving
a
gap,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
general
saving
statute
would
properly
be
invoked.
that
statute
says
in
substance
that
the
repeal
of
statutory
provisions
shall
not
release
any
liability
incurred
under
the
old
law,
unless
the
repealing
act
shall
so
expressly
provide.
now
respondent
answers
that
contention
with
this
argument.
it's
says
that
it
had
no
liability
in
july
1959
when
the
finality
act
was
passed
because
at
that
point
it
had
not
yet
violated
the
commission's
cease-and-desist
order.
now
we
would
agree
that
in
july
of
1959
there
was
no
fixed
liability
in
the
sense
of
an
applicable
sanction
or
an
approved
penalty
or
a
liability
for
a
sum
certain,
but
we
would
argue
that
liability
is
satisfied
by
the
very
entry
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
even
though
any
penalty
would
be
dependent
upon
the
future
event.
and
in
a
number
of
labor
board
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
the
courts
of
appeals
that
an
analogous
question
has
arisen.
the
cases
i
refer
to
are
cases
in
which
the
labor
board
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
under
the
wagner
act.
before
the
order
was
judicially
enforced,
the
provisions
of
the
wagner
act
under
which
the
order
had
been
promulgated
was
superseded
by
provisions
of
taft-hartley,
yet
in
those
cases
the
courts
of
appeals
concluded
that
a
administrative
cease
and
desist
order
is
a
liability
within
the
meaning
of
the
savings
statute
even
though
there
is
no
sanction
until
the
order,
the
administrative
order
has
been
judicially
enforced.
now
that
brings
me
finally
to
respondent's
suggestion,
a
point
to
which
mr.
justice
harlan
adverted
a
moment
ago,
a
suggestion
that
the
commission
does
not
need
the
old
remedy
for
old
orders
because
when
there
is
a
violation,
it
can
bring
a
new
complaint
and
get
the
benefit
upon
it's
finding
a
violation
of
the
new
procedures.
now
i
agree,
i
think
the
commission
probably
agrees
that
there
may
well
be
cases
in
which
it
would
be
fully
as
expeditious
to
start
a
new
case
as
it
would
be
to
pursue
the
old
one
and
one
of
the
commissioners
has
strongly
questioned
that
as
being
of
that
view.
i
should
like
to
stress
that
nothing
i
have
suggested
would
prevent
the
commission
from
pursuing
its
options
in
that
regard.
quite
the
contrary
my
only
point
is
that
it
should
have
the
option,
that
congress
has
left
it
the
option
to
enforce
its
old
orders
as
well
as
to
bring
new
cases.
and
the
commission
is
of
the
view
that
there
are
at
least
two
situations
in
which
it
maybe
considerably
more
difficult
to
prove
the
basis
of
a
new
cease
and
desist
order
than
it
would
be
to
establish
a
violation
of
an
outstanding
order.
but
one
thing
a
cease
and
desist
order
may
and
it
sometimes
does
direct
a
respondent
to
refrain
from
acts
which
are
not
in
and
of
themselves
unlawful.
once
a
violation
has
been
proved,
an
administrative
agency
or
a
court
of
equity
may
be
empowered
to
take
necessary
steps
to
prevent
a
repetition
and
sweep
more
broadly.
as
this
court
put
it
in
the
national
led
case
a
known
violator
may
expect
some
fencing
in.
a
second
led
is
not
invariably
necessary
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
to
litigate
all
of
the
issues
which
would
or
might
have
to
be
litigated
in
a
brand
new
proceeding.
thus
the
record
in
the
earlier
administrative
proceeding,
the
proceeding
leading
to
the
initial
cease
and
desist
order
may
suffice
in
the
violation
proceeding
to
dispose
of
particular
elements
in
the
case
at
that
second
stage
and
indeed
this
court's
morton
salt
and
ruberoid
opinions
are
both
quite
suggestive
as
to
that
possibility.
in
short
we
think
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
commission
may
find
that
enforcing
old
orders
rather
than
instituting
new
proceedings
will
be
to
its
advantage.
when
it
will
follow
up
an
old
order
rather
than
institute
a
new
case
it
seems
to
us
is
a
matter
for
the
commission
itself
rather
than
for
the
courts
to
attempt
to
decide,
but
our
point
here
is
simply
the
congress
has
reviewed
the
matter
has
not
closed
the
door
upon
the
enforcement
of
pre-1959
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
legal
status
of
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
order
in
question
was
issued
in
january
of
1959
and
the
date
is
important
here,
issued
upon
the
consent
of
the
respondent
jantzen.
in
substance
the
order
directed
the
jantzen
to
cease-and-desist
from
further
discrimination
in
advertising
and
promotional
allowances
granted
its
customers,
a
form
of
discrimination
covered
by
section
2(d)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
your
honor
it
was
a
consent
order.
and
the
only
statutory
problem
which
is
here
results
from
the
fact
that
later
in
that
same
year
1959,
specifically
in
july,
the
clayton
act
was
amended
so
as
to
provide
both
new
and
strengthened
methods
of
enforcement
of
cease-and-desist
orders.
now
respondent
contends
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
agreed
that
a
practical
consequence
albeit
an
inadvertent
one
of
this
amendment
was
to
make
the
preexisting
january
1959
order
wholly
unenforceable
and
it
consequently
acknowledged
violations
of
this
1959
order,
violations
which
were
found
some
years
later
in
1964
cannot
be
reached
through
the
1959
cease-and-desist
order.
we
urge
of
course
that
this
was
not
an
intended
result,
a
point
on
which
there
appears
to
be
little
if
any
basis
for
dispute
and
that
it
is
not
a
result
which
is
required
by
the
amendatory
language.
we
make
the
further
i
would
say
complementary
argument
that
if
the
amendment
should
be
read
as
creating
a
gap
and
leaving
this
former
order
unenforceable,
then
we
say
alternatively
that
gap
would
be
filled
by
the
general
savings
statute
1
usc
109.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
expected
parochial
language
it
said
perhaps
inadvertent.
i
am
going
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
and
that
plainly
congress
thought
it
was
protecting
and
strengthening
the
act.
it
also
made
reference
in
the
committee
report
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
to
numerous
compliance
investigations
which
the
commission
had
underway
and
there's
not
a
whisper
in
the
entire
history
that
congress
thought
it
was
going
to
make
any
orders
unenforceable.
so
i
think
there
is
little
basis
at
least
for
any
suggestion
that
congress
thought
this
result
was
going
to
fallout.
i
might
note
incidentally
that
the
second
circuit
has
reasonable
come
out
in
direct
opposition
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
and
that
in
earlier
--
at
an
earlier
date
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
had
indicated
although
that
precise
issue
was
not
before
it
for
a
decision
that
it
excepted
the
commission's
view
which
i
shall
explain
as
i
go
along
that
the
old
orders
continue
to
be
enforced
by
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
printed
it
since
it's
not
available
in
the
reports
in
the
supplemental
memorandum
that
your
honor
should
have.
now
before
i
attempt
to
develop
our
arguments,
let
me
seek
if
i
may
to
clarify
the
issue
by
recalling
to
your
honors'
the
pre-1959
procedures
and
then
comparing
them
to
the
procedures
for
judicial
review
and
enforcement
as
provided
in
1959
by
the
so
called
finality
act
of
1959.
now
prior
to
that
year,
clayton
act
orders,
cease
and
desist
orders
could
come
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
one
of
two
ways.
the
party
subject
to
the
order
could
bring
a
review
proceeding
to
set
it
aside
or
to
modify
it.
there
was
no
period
of
limitations
prior
to
1959
so
that
the
order
might
stand
for
years
and
then
ultimately
a
review
proceeding
might
be
instituted.
the
next
paragraph
of
the
old
statute
provided
that
the
commission
for
its
part
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
to
seek
enforcement,
but
it
was
only
entitled
to
enforcement
if
it
could
show
two
things.
first
that
it's
cease
and
desist
order
was
valid
and
second
that
its
order
had
been
violated
since
it
had
been
issued,
in
other
words
it
had
to
show
a
post
order
violation,
a
second
act.
sanctions
attached
only
if
an
order
of
enforcement
was
obtained
and
a
third
violation
thereafter
shown
at
which
point
of
course
the
contempt
power
of
court
of
appeals
would
be
available.
now
as
i've
indicated
accordingly
there
might
be
--
there
might
have
been
under
the
1953
--
pre-1959
procedures
two
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals
preliminary
to
a
decree
enforcing
the
commission's
order,
the
one
proceeding
by
the
responded
company
seeking
review
of
the
order,
the
other
proceeding
by
the
commission
seeking
enforcement.
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
respondent's
appeal
that
the
order
was
valid
did
not
automatically
carry
enforcement
with
it.
indeed
this
court
made
it
clear
in
the
old
ruberoid
decision
that
even
if
a
commission
order
was
affirmed
that
enforcement
would
not
follow
unless
in
addition
violation,
post
order
violation
was
shown.
now
these
old
procedures
as
i've
outlined
initially
applied
both
to
orders
issued
under
the
clayton
act
and
to
orders
issued
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
both
of
which
statutes
of
course
were
roughly
contemporaneous.
they
were
cumbersome
and
in
1938
congress
changed
them
so
far
as
cease
and
desist
orders
issued
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
were
concerned.
that
was
done
by
the
so
called
wheeler-lea
amendments
and
in
large
part
though
not
in
toto,
the
finality
act
of
1959
or
clayton
act
orders
what
the
wheeler-lea
amendments
had
done
in
1938
for
federal
trade
commission
act
orders.
and
the
new
procedures
brought
into
the
law
by
wheeler-lea
can
be
simply
stated.
it
provided
that
if
an
order
issued
under
the
trade
commission
act
was
not
appealed
within
60
days,
it
would
become
final.
if
it
were
appealed
within
that
60-day
period,
it
would
become
final
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
review
proceedings.
under
this
scheme,
the
wheeler-lea
scheme
final
orders
were
equipped
with
teeth.
violation
of
any
such
final
order
would
carry
civil
penalties.
now
there
were
numerous
cease
and
desist
orders
outstanding
when
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
was
passed
too
and
the
happily
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
made
some
specific
provision
for
that
which
the
statute,
we
are
dealing
with
today
did
not
make.
wheeler-lea
in
a
separate
section
said
that
all
federal
trade
commission
act
orders
which
had
not
already
been
taken
to
the
courts
would
become
final
if
the
private
party
affected
by
that
order
did
not
seek
judicial
review
within
60
days
of
the
enactment
of
the
new
enforcement
procedure.
and
as
a
result
all
federal
trade
commission
act
orders
would
become
final
and
self
executing
either
by
the
failure
of
the
party
to
seek
judicial
review
within
the
60
days
allowed
by
the
statute
or
if
he
did
seek
review
by
his
failure
to
sustain
it's
challenge.
now,
the
commission
sought
similar
legislation
in
relation
to
clayton
act
cease-and-desist
orders
over
a
period
of
years
and
various
bills
differing
somewhat
in
their
details
were
sporadically
introduced.
it
was
not
until
1959
that
the
comparable
legislation
was
adopted.
i
say
comparable
because
there
are
some
differences
and
those
differences
do
concern
us
in
this
litigation.
first
very
briefly
as
to
the
similarities;
the
finality
act
of
1959
like
the
wheeler-lea
amendments
upon
which
it
was
patterned,
substituted
new,
review
and
enforcement
procedures
for
the
old.
just
like
wheeler-lea
it
provided
that
the
clayton
act
orders
would
become
final
60-days
after
service
upon
the
respondent
company
unless
judicial
review
were
sought
and
further
of
course
if
review
were
thought
they
would
become
final
to
the
extent
sustained
upon
the
completion
of
the
review
proceeding.
again
like
wheeler-lea,
it
provided
that
final
clayton
act
orders
would
be
self
executing
and
would
carry
penalties
also
that
they
might
be
imports
through
the
injunction
process.
in
short
then
so
for
as
clayton
act
orders
issued
after
july
1959
are
concerned
one
may
say
that
the
wheeler-lea
and
the
clayton
act
and
the
finality
act
procedures
are
for
all
practical
purpose
is
same.
now
wheeler-lea
as
i
indicated
earlier
contained
this
separate
section
which
provided
in
substance
that
in
the
case
of
an
already
outstanding
order
the
respondent
would
have
60
days
to
go
to
court
and
failing
that
the
order
would
become
final.
the
finality
act
which
was
senator
sparkman's
senate
bill
enacted
in
the
law,
adopted
a
different
approach
for
already
outstanding
orders
than
it
adopted
cease-and-desist
orders
thereafter
to
be
issued.
section
2
of
the
finality
act
which
appears
at
page
39
in
the
government's
brief,
states
that
the
review
and
enforcement
procedures
provided
by
the
new
statute
and
the
amendments
made
by
section
1
shall
have
no
application
to
any
proceedings
initiated
before
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act,
and
then
it
goes
on,
that
each
such
proceeding
shall
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
such
section
as
they
existed
on
the
day
preceding
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act.
thus
the
statute
tells
us
quite
explicitly
that
if
a
court
of
appeals
proceeding
involving
the
cease-and-desist
order
in
this
case
had
been
pending,
when
the
finality
act
was
passed
in
july
1959
that
the
old
procedures
would
govern
and
that
the
commission
could
seek
enforcement
in
the
case
of
post
order
violation.
what
the
statute
fails
to
tell
us
in
terms,
is
what
procedures
are
to
govern
cease-and-desist
orders
issued
prior
to
july
of
1959,
in
relation
to
which
no
proceeding
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
of
july
1959
and
that
of
course
is
the
factual
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
-â€“
substituted
new
review
and
enforcement
procedures
for
the
old
and
that
these
were
prospective
in
their
operation,
they
were
going
to
govern
all
orders
thereafter
issued.
the
statute
also
explicitly
provided
that
in
respect
of
any
proceeding
that
was
already
in
court,
the
earlier
pre
1959
procedures
would
govern.
jantzen
argues
the
congress
repealed
the
old
provisions
except
in
so
for
as
it
enacted
an
explicit
savings
provision
and
that
in
consequence
there
is
a
gap
because
although
congress
provided
for
the
continuance
of
the
old
methods
of
enforcement
in
respect
to
cases
already
pending
in
court,
it
did
not
in
terms
provide
any
method
of
enforcement
in
respect
of
pre-1959
cease-and-desist
orders
which
had
not
yet
been
taken
to
court.
it
seems
hardly
likely
that
congress
engaged
as
this
congress
was
in
urging
of
sponsor
in
strengthening
and
protecting
the
act
would
have
knowingly
discarded
the
vast
majority
of
the
cease-and-desist
orders
and
cast
them
in
limbo
making
them
a
wholly
unenforceable.
in
fact
when
the
1959
legislation
was
passed,
there
were
some
440
clayton
act
cease-and-desist
orders
outstanding,
some
50
of
which
have
been
affirmed
or
enforced
and
in
additional
11
then
pending
on
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
respondent's
argument
would
mean
that
the
remaining
379
orders
with
many
of
them
entered
after
protracted
and
strenuously
contested
proceedings
would
be
unenforceable.
i
think
it's
been
conceivable
that
congress
would
have
knowingly
discarded
this
large
number
of
orders
without
even
a
whisper
in
the
entire
legislative
history
and
there
is
none
of
this
is
what
it
was
about
or
this
is
what
it
intended.
i
think
it
also
offends
the
commonsense
considerably
to
suppose
that
congress
would
make
explicit
provision
for
commission
of
enforcement
of
an
order
which
is
then
being
challenged
in
the
courts
but
makes
no
allowance
whatever
for
the
commission
to
enforce
an
order
which
has
not
even
been
questioned,
but
yet
that
would
be
the
consequence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yeah,
in
terms
it
does.
there
is
clearly
a
inartful
drafting,
assuming
that
i
am
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
saying
that
this
was
unintended.
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
have
concluded
that
the
obvious
congressional
purpose
here
was
to
make
the
old
procedures
applicable
to
pre
1959
orders
and
the
new
procedures
prospective
only.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir,
i
certainly
sir.
as
i
said
both
those
circuits
have
concluded
that
the
obvious
purpose
was
to
make
the
new
provisions
prospective
and
those
courts
have
concluded
that
the
statute
can
fairly
be
read
in
light
of
it's
obvious
purpose
as
repealing
the
old
provisions
for
enforcement
only
and
respect
of
orders
thereafter
issued
by
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
has
shortly
after
the
finality
act
was
passed
in
its
sperry
rand
case
that
the
new
statute
was
prospective
only
and
that
all
pre-1959
orders
where
to
be
enforced
by
the
old
statute.
judge
fayes
suggested
in
that
opinion
that
the
explanation
of
the
rather
limited
language
used
the
reference
only
to
cases
pending
in
the
courts
may
have
been
prompted
by
the
dealing
on
the
part
of
congress
that
otherwise
some
doubts
might
exist
about
proceedings
which
were
in
litigation.
in
all
events
the
commission
duly
advised
as
a
result
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
litigation
that
the
new
statute
was
prospective
only
directed
an
investigation
and
i'm
now
returning
to
the
particulars
of
this
case.
in
1964
to
determine
whether
respondent
jantzen
was
in
compliance
with
the
old
1959
order.
jantzen
acknowledged
in
that
commission
proceeding
that
it
had
violated
the
order
and
indeed
it
stipulated
two,
three
instances
of
violation.
the
commission
thereupon
filed
a
petition
for
a
court
order
adjoining
compliance
and
at
that
point
jantzen
objected
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
because
on
a
strictly
literal
reading
of
the
statute
one
might
say
there
was
a
gap.
i've
indicated
already
i
think
that
we
believe
the
other
circuits
that
have
viewed
this
matter
are
correct
in
believing
that
one
may
read
into
this
language
a
continuation
of
the
statute
not
only
for
pending
cases,
but
for
all
of
cases
including
those
in
which
the
respondent
hadn't
even
challenged
the
order.
this
brings
me
and
i
shall
treat
it
only
very
briefly
to
the
alternative
argument
which
we
think
is
a
sound
one
if
there
is
any
--
if
the
court
finds
occasion
to
reach
it
and
that
is
the
argument
that
if
the
finality
act
were
read
as
leaving
a
gap,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
general
saving
statute
would
properly
be
invoked.
that
statute
says
in
substance
that
the
repeal
of
statutory
provisions
shall
not
release
any
liability
incurred
under
the
old
law,
unless
the
repealing
act
shall
so
expressly
provide.
now
respondent
answers
that
contention
with
this
argument.
it's
says
that
it
had
no
liability
in
july
1959
when
the
finality
act
was
passed
because
at
that
point
it
had
not
yet
violated
the
commission's
cease-and-desist
order.
now
we
would
agree
that
in
july
of
1959
there
was
no
fixed
liability
in
the
sense
of
an
applicable
sanction
or
an
approved
penalty
or
a
liability
for
a
sum
certain,
but
we
would
argue
that
liability
is
satisfied
by
the
very
entry
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
even
though
any
penalty
would
be
dependent
upon
the
future
event.
and
in
a
number
of
labor
board
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
the
courts
of
appeals
that
an
analogous
question
has
arisen.
the
cases
i
refer
to
are
cases
in
which
the
labor
board
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
under
the
wagner
act.
before
the
order
was
judicially
enforced,
the
provisions
of
the
wagner
act
under
which
the
order
had
been
promulgated
was
superseded
by
provisions
of
taft-hartley,
yet
in
those
cases
the
courts
of
appeals
concluded
that
a
administrative
cease
and
desist
order
is
a
liability
within
the
meaning
of
the
savings
statute
even
though
there
is
no
sanction
until
the
order,
the
administrative
order
has
been
judicially
enforced.
now
that
brings
me
finally
to
respondent's
suggestion,
a
point
to
which
mr.
justice
harlan
adverted
a
moment
ago,
a
suggestion
that
the
commission
does
not
need
the
old
remedy
for
old
orders
because
when
there
is
a
violation,
it
can
bring
a
new
complaint
and
get
the
benefit
upon
it's
finding
a
violation
of
the
new
procedures.
now
i
agree,
i
think
the
commission
probably
agrees
that
there
may
well
be
cases
in
which
it
would
be
fully
as
expeditious
to
start
a
new
case
as
it
would
be
to
pursue
the
old
one
and
one
of
the
commissioners
has
strongly
questioned
that
as
being
of
that
view.
i
should
like
to
stress
that
nothing
i
have
suggested
would
prevent
the
commission
from
pursuing
its
options
in
that
regard.
quite
the
contrary
my
only
point
is
that
it
should
have
the
option,
that
congress
has
left
it
the
option
to
enforce
its
old
orders
as
well
as
to
bring
new
cases.
and
the
commission
is
of
the
view
that
there
are
at
least
two
situations
in
which
it
maybe
considerably
more
difficult
to
prove
the
basis
of
a
new
cease
and
desist
order
than
it
would
be
to
establish
a
violation
of
an
outstanding
order.
but
one
thing
a
cease
and
desist
order
may
and
it
sometimes
does
direct
a
respondent
to
refrain
from
acts
which
are
not
in
and
of
themselves
unlawful.
once
a
violation
has
been
proved,
an
administrative
agency
or
a
court
of
equity
may
be
empowered
to
take
necessary
steps
to
prevent
a
repetition
and
sweep
more
broadly.
as
this
court
put
it
in
the
national
led
case
a
known
violator
may
expect
some
fencing
in.
a
second
led
is
not
invariably
necessary
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
to
litigate
all
of
the
issues
which
would
or
might
have
to
be
litigated
in
a
brand
new
proceeding.
thus
the
record
in
the
earlier
administrative
proceeding,
the
proceeding
leading
to
the
initial
cease
and
desist
order
may
suffice
in
the
violation
proceeding
to
dispose
of
particular
elements
in
the
case
at
that
second
stage
and
indeed
this
court's
morton
salt
and
ruberoid
opinions
are
both
quite
suggestive
as
to
that
possibility.
in
short
we
think
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
commission
may
find
that
enforcing
old
orders
rather
than
instituting
new
proceedings
will
be
to
its
advantage.
when
it
will
follow
up
an
old
order
rather
than
institute
a
new
case
it
seems
to
us
is
a
matter
for
the
commission
itself
rather
than
for
the
courts
to
attempt
to
decide,
but
our
point
here
is
simply
the
congress
has
reviewed
the
matter
has
not
closed
the
door
upon
the
enforcement
of
pre-1959
order.
