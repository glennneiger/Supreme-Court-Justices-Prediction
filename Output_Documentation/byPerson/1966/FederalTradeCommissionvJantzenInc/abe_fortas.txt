what's
your
point
–
what
is
your
legal
point?
is
it
that
this
demonstrates
the
construction
that
the
commissions
place
upon
the
statutory
situation
and
that
that
construction
can
be
taken
as
binding?
justice
abe
fortas
now
we
could
even
decide
that
the
trade
commission
is
not
correct,
couldn't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
are
saying
and
we
ought
to
take
the
trade
but
this
is
a
construction
by
the
trade
commission
let
us
say
the
omission
of
these
old
provisions
from
the
pamphlet
as
a
construction
by
trade
commission
and
we
ought
to

that
construction
as
persuasive
and
kind
of
hard
to
correct.
