mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
will
argue
now.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
it
is
with
reluctance
that
we
find
ourselves
here
taking
at
somewhat
noble
position
and
urging
the
court
to
overturn
some
50
years
more
or
less
consistent
practices
by
the
commission
and
also
in
some
sense
three
decisions
of
this
court.
perhaps
if
the
court
had
been
invited
our
views,
we
would
have
let
this
matter
sleep
for
another
50
years.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
can
be
so
viewed
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
decisions
are
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
there
is
that
element
--
there
is
that
obstacle
here
but
i
must
say
that
in
all
three
of
the
decisions,
they
are
all
suggestions
as
to
mean
through
which
the
railroad
can
avoid.
it's
my
ability
for
the
entire
trip
suggestions
which
we
cannot
fully
understand
because
one
of
them
is
not
consistent
with
position
taken
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
a
position
as
to
which
all
counsel
here
are
agreed
that
is
that
seems
to
be
a
suggestion
that,
if
only
the
railroad
had
published
an
alternative
rate
to
the
border.
then
it
would
not
have
been
liable
for
the
entire
reparation
due
on
the
joint
through
rate.
yet,
this
court
has
held
and
the
commission
has
consistently
held
that
there
can
only
be
one
rate
available
to
a
particular
shipper
or
a
particular
shipment.
therefore
that
alternative
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
a
real
one.
now,
since
that
is
part
of
the
premise
of
these
decisions,
it
is
difficult
to
follow
the
decisions
get
through
of
any
of
that
and
that
may
give
less
reluctance
in
qualifying
them
or
overturning
them
at
this
great
day.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
what
i'm
really
suggesting
is
that
congress
also
may
have
been
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
decisions
and
it
may
not
be
altogether
fair
to
attribute
to
congress
any
clear
understanding
of
then
that
we
have
now.
in
connection
with
the
your
honor's
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
suggesting
that
it
would
be
imposing
on
the
commission
a
very
heavy
additional
beauty
by
requiring
it
to
find
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
answer
is
that
it
would
impose
no
additional
duty
whatever.
instead
of
finding
a
reasonable
international
joint
though
rate
which
the
commission
had
done
in
this
case
and
would
under
its
practice
do
in
every
such
case.
it
would
instead
not
in
addition
but
instead
find
the
maximum
reasonable
proportional
rate
to
the
border.
a
thing
which
it
would
seem
to
us
to
be
an
easier
operations
since
we're
dealing
with
the
familiar
american
carriers,
familiar
american
cars,
familiar
american
territory
and
not
looking
somewhat
blindly
over
the
border
in
canada
which
is
necessary
aspect
to
determine
in
the
total
reasonable
rate.
so
there
is
no
problem
of
imposing
additional
burden
on
the
commission.
i
should
say
perhaps
also
at
the
outset
that
we
could
not
agree
with
the
respondents
--
there
attempt
to
distinguished
these
three
decisions
of
the
court.
because
we
have
the
same
difficulty
that
i
think
it
was
voice
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
cannot
see
really
what
difference
it
makes
if
there
is
an
additional
rate
published
to
the
border,
especially,
if
that
additional
rate
to
the
border
is
not
available
to
this
particular
shipper.
if
he's
compelled
where
there
is
a
joint
through
rate
to
ship
to
pay
that
charge
then
its
more
comfort
to
the
shipper
that
there
is
another
rate
which
that
can
give
that.
it
is
true
that
the
commission's
finding
as
to
this
other
rate
if
it
has
been
done
independently
in
a
prior
proceeding,
may
furnish
evidence
of
what
that
portion
of
the
trip,
what
charge
should
be
meet
to
that
portion
of
the
trip.
and
to
that
extent,
here
the
carrier
cannot
be
taxed
with
having
failed
to
enlighten
the
commission
as
to
an
alternative
way
of
computing
reparations
because
the
commission
itself
perhaps
if
this
consolidated
rendering
case
is
appropriate
--
it
is
an
appropriate
then
had
already
found
on
its
own
such
a
standard.
and
therefore
there
is
no
need
for
the
carrier
to
make
that
choice
to
the
extent
that
those
early
decisions
of
this
court
rest
on
a
default
of
the
carrier
that
show
the
commission,
how
else
to
go
about
accessing
reparations,
this
may
be
a
distinguishable
case.
however
as
we
say,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
every
case
the
maximum
allowable
reparation
is
with
respect
to
the
american
portion
of
the
trip.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
american
portion
of
the
trip
that
is
put
it
in
simpler
terms
perhaps
the
american
carrier
on
international
journey
ought
to
be
made
to
disgorge
only
so
much
as
he
had
pocketed
that
is
the
excess
the
amount
pocketed.
he
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
what
i
mean
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
the
commission
can
go
no
further
from
this.
now,
i
think
we
all
begin
with
the
common
ground
that
the
commission's
only
proper
concern
is
to
regulate
rail
transportation
in
the
united
states.
i
think
that's
very
plainly
what
the
statute
says.
that
is
that
the
parties
we're
concerned
here
to
prevent
or
to
provide
a
remedy
for
excessive
charges
made
by
rail
carriers
in
this
country.
it
has
no
concern
with
the
conduct
to
all
the
charges
imposed
by
canadian
railroad
in
canada
or
mexican
railroads
or
mexico.
nor
is
this
surprising
that
short
of
extra
territorial
jurisdiction
might
prevent
serious
questions.
nor
is
the
commission
had
report
to
have
an
expertise
about
conditions
in
foreign
countries
or
of
the
conditions
that
foreign
carriers.
here
is
may
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
commission
does
not
claim
any
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
fortas
to
prescribe
joint
through
international
rates.
on
the
contrary,
recognizes
that
it
has
no
such
authority
and
yet,
it
is
willing
or
fix
it
must
have
those,
judge
what
it
cannot
control
and
that
is
judge
the
reasonableness
of
the
charge
made
for
the
canadian
portion
of
the
traffic.
eventhough
it
concedes
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
control
that
judge
regularly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
i
frankly
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
figures
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
made
that
finding
solely
for
the
purpose
of
computing
the
reparation.
it
concedes
that
cannot
prescribe
that
rate
as
the
international
rate
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
we
take
first
of
those
positions
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
say
that
each
neither
can
it
prescribe
the
international
joint
though
rate
nor
can
it
judge
the
reasonableness
of
an
international
joint
through
rate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
would
it
involve
within
the
judging
what
is
beyond
its
proper
concern.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you're
entirely
right,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
is
our
position.
perhaps
our
brief
doesn't
isn't
officially
emphatic
on
that
point.
well,
the
basic
fallacy
here
it
seems
to
us
is
judging
the
reasonableness
of
an
international
rate
part
of
which
occurs
in
canada
and
yet,
the
commission
judges
it
under
american
standards
which
are
legally
inapplicable
and
otherwise,
inappropriate
to
transportation
in
canada
which
is
subject
to
a
canadian
law
and
a
canadian
commission
under
wholly
different
standards.
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
by
american
standards
an
international
joint
through
rate
is
unreasonable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
see
no
reason
to
prohibit
and
i
think
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
act
does
not
prohibit
the
entering
into
such
joint
international
rates.
nor
that
we
think
there
is
any
public
interest
on
the
contrary
and
in
discouraging
the
entering
into
such
joint
international
rates
which
normally
have
benefits
to
shippers.
so,
recognizing
the
virtue
of
joint
rates
and
yet
the
inability
of
the
commission
to
judge
them.
we
have
attempted
to
device
a
way
in
which
these
two
principles
can
be
accommodated
and
yet
the
shipper
can
receive
full
reparation
from
the
american
carrier
to
the
extent
that
the
american
carrier
is
responsible
for
the
open
charge.
and
at
the
same
time
the
carrier
is
not
deterred
from
entering
into
these
joint
rates
by
being
told
that
when
he
does
then
he
must
spare
the
entire
reparation
award
eventhough
his
canadian
partner
is
responsible
for
a
large
share
of
it.
and
incidentally,
his
canadian
partner,
his
mexican
partner
maybe
the
government
of
canada
or
the
government
of
mexico.
one
of
the
railroads
in
this
case
is
owned
by
the
government
of
canada
and
as
i
understand
it,
most
mexican
railroads
internationalized.
now,
under
their
law
it
may
be
--
it
might
be
surprising
particularly
would
be
contrary
to
the
normal
presumption
to
suppose
that
the
government
of
canada
or
the
government
of
mexico
allows
its
own
railroad
to
over
charge.
therefore,
if
even
proper
to
have
permission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
surprise
me
to
have
--
i
think
it's
necessary
to
have
a
commission
pass
on
the
rate
of
nationalize
railroad
for
all
those
have
those
rates
administratively
determine
in
the
first
instance
that
a
correct
standards.
i
think
that
probably
is
the
situation
in
mexico.
when
you
have
both
private
and
public
carriers
that
are
in
canada
and
probably
both
subject
to
the
board
and
treated
very
much
alike.
now,
let
me
made
clear
that
our
position
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
bar
on
the
commission's
poaching
into
canadian
territory
should
result
in
any
injuries
or
inability
by
the
shipper
to
obtain
full
reparation
from
the
american
carrier
to
the
extent
that
the
american
carriers
are
responsible
for
that
excessive
charge.
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know,
this
record
does
not
disclose
mr.
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
if
that
the
--
it
is
ordinarily
done.
it
is
a
jointly
agreed
tariffs
and
the
divisions
between
the
roads
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
subject
to
this
that
he
may
ask
the
commission.
i
understand
the
commission's
practice
it
will
if
it
--
commission
goes
a
differently
than
we
would
but
if
they
find
that
the
american
carriers
we
would
put
it's
overcharging
--
receiving
too
much
money
for
his
portion
of
this
joint
transportation.
they
can
require
him
to
withdraw
from
this
particular
tariff.
now,
the
commission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
but
that
is
this
--
the
commission's
owned
recognition
of
the
limitation
of
the
jurisdiction.
and--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
cannot
describe
a
new
law
joint
through
rate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
i
assume
your
honor's
question
is
directed
to
this
solution
that
we
would
propose
to
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
--
it
seems
to
us
that
whether
--
let
me
say
that
might
be
two
alternatives
so,
one
is
to
have
the
american
commission
governing
transportation
heading
north
in
the
case
of
canada.
and
canada
is
doing
it
when
its
point
of
origin
is
in
canada.
as
i
understand
at
one
time
the
commission,
american
commission
and
the
canadian
commission
informally
or
perhaps
formally
agreed
to
this
sort
of
exchange
in
jurisdiction
that
is
clearly
no
longer
in
effect
because
the
american
commission
purports
to
regulate
reparation
purposes
in
both
directions.
but
even
there
their
all
the
problems
we
see
here
and
it
would
seem
to
us.
we
don't
see
any
real
problem
with
a
legislative
solution
of
the
kind
we
suggest
here
as
open
on
the
present
statute.
the
statute
very
clearly
says
and
it
now
reads,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
foreign
transportation
what
one
so
long
--
only
in
so
far
as
the
transportation
occurs
in
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
it
occurs
within
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
the
suggestion
is
that
this
is
meaningless
if
the
commission's
jurisdiction
or
all
perhaps
this
adopts
the
border.
it
seems
to
me
the
plain
purpose
of
this
provision
of
statute
is
to
cover
what
might
otherwise
be
intrastate
transportation
and
therefore
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
congress.
a
shipment
destined
for
a
foreign
country
eventhough
it
only
travels
through
one
state
is
foreign
commerce.
yet,
it
can
be
regulated
only
to
the
border.
it
seems
to
be
that's
reason
enough
to
have
this
provision
in
the
statute
and
that
is
all
it
was
meant
to
provide.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
just
simple
as
that
mr.
justice
black
and
that's
--
that's
what
we'd
expect
to
find
an
american
commission
limited
to
and
since
it
works
since
it
can
work.
there's
nothing
unworkable
about
that
limitation.
we
don't
see
why
it
shouldn't
be
the
practical
rule
for
reparations
purposes
as
it
is
for
rate
making
purposes.
let
me
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
our
suggestion
is
that
it
did
not
present
an
insuperable
problem.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
--
i
don't
know
that's
inhibitively,
i
suppose
it
can
be
made
either
by
the
ship
or
the
consignee?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
there
is
or
let
me
say
if
your
honor
fully
appreciates
that
is
the
reverse
of
this
case
where
its
rather
ironic
for
the
canadian
consignee
to
be
coming
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rather
that
its
own
courts
and
to
the
claiming
reparations
from
the
american
carrier
or
all
of
them
the
persons
he
dealt
with,
the
canadian.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
returning
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
even
if
it
were
as
your
honor
puts
in
the
hypothetical
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
assume
unrealistically
that
the
american
carrier
was
in
full
control
of
the
rate
to
be
charge
to
the
point
of
destination.
or
it
would
involve
the
commission
as
i
say
in
judging
reasonableness
beyond
the
border.
now
for
purposes
of
liability
for
damage
on
the
goods
that
is
the
rule
mr.
justice
fortas
and
there
there's
certainly
no
objection
to
it.
but
for
purposes
of
awarding
reparations
which
unfortunately
involves
this
element
of
judging
the
reasonableness
of
rate,
it
becomes
unfair
and
the
unfinished
may
not
always
be
against
the
carrier.
it's
maybe
unfair
to
the
shipper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
--
that
is
true
and
that
is
explicitly
provided
for
in
the
statutes
and
we
take
that
as
a
legislative
indication
that
when
there
is
extra
territorial
jurisdiction
as
it
worked.
the
congress
has
been
careful
in
this
act
to
expressly
provide
for
it.
let
me
say
one
word
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
really
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
would
strongly
doubt
it.
i
don't
think
this
problem
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
i
don't
pretend
that
it
is
a
very
momentous
problem
as
has
been
said.
as
far
as
i
know
or
wholly
accurately
the
commission
has
been
using
another
formula
for
many
years
and
it
has
not
created
very
upsetting
problems.
on
other
hand,
when
this
court
after
40
years
has
decided
to
take
another
look
at
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
existing
system
while
tolerable
in
some
sense
does
not
make
sense.
it
is
not
--
does
not
conform
to
the
statute
is
unfair
both
to
shippers
and
the
carriers
in
different
situations.
and
that
it
should
not
be
perpetuated
eventhough
the
world
would
not
come
to
an
end
if
it
were.
now,
it's
just
this
simply
has
been
no
occasions
for
the
executive
branch
to
address
itself
to
this
problem
and
therefore
no
suggestion
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
the
points
of
your
suggestion.
i
--
all
i
can
say
in
defense
of
our
position
here
is
that
we
felt
this
was
not
a
matter
of
the
congress.
this
congress
had
already
spoken
rather
plainly
as
to
where
the
line
was
drawn.no
one
has
much
notice
of
that
the
commission
has
step
over
that
line.
now,
this
court
has
condoned
it
and
grant
the
serious
obstacles
that
are
presented
by
this
court's
prior
decision.
all
i
can
say
about
them
is
that
the
--
we
submit
they
were
wrongly
decided
and
should
be
reexamined.
they
rest
on
the
joint
tortfeasor
doctrine
and
i
think
if
i
could
demonstrate
the
inapplicability
of
that
doctrine
here.
the
force
of
those
decisions
might
be
somewhat
lesser.
the
joint
tortfeasor
doctrine
in
this
situation,
unlike
the
domestic
carriage
situation
rests
on
the
premise
that
a
tort
has
been
committed
and
when
we
ask
where
the
tort
has
been
committed,
it
must
be
in
canada.
now,
it
must
be
in
canada
because
the
theory
of
the
decision
of
this
but
it
doesn't
matter
where
it
happened
so
long
as
these
two
partners
have
joined
in
creating
it
--
in
creating
an
excessive
rate
which
may
be
excessive
only
because
the
canadian
portion
of
it
is
excessive
by
american
standards.
then
the
tort
for
the
purpose
of
my
hypothetical
at
least,
occurred
in
canada.
now
it's
all
the
strange
notion
that
an
american
commission
should
be
deciding
whether
a
canadian
company
in
canada
committed
a
tort
and
worst
by
applying
american
law.
if
we
were
to
apply
canadian
law
eventhough
at
the
present
problems
of
the
american
commission
not
being
expert
in
canadian
law
and
the
suggestion
that
it
might
lead
that
question
better
to
the
canadian
authority.
at
least
there
would
no
problem
about
finding
the
tort.
but
here
by
hypothesis,
we
have
a
rate
which
is
legal,
lawful
in
canada
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
which
is
lawful
under
canadian
standards.
but
which
by
american
standards
is
too
high.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
black,
the
american
commission
does
not
follow
up
expressly
say
and
i
suppose
that
counsel
will
confirm
it.
that
when
the
judge
the
international
joint
through
rate
for
the
canadian
as
for
the
american
portion,
they
applied
american
standards.
they
wholly
disregard
the
canadian
law
and
the
committee
--
canadian
commissions
prescriptions
of
the
rate
for
that
portion
of
the
transportation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
they
would
be
best
advised
to
say
are
we
all
together
since
it
isn't
necessary.
the
difficulty
is
involved
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
the
solution
we
suggest
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
court
is
not
only
free
to
do
it
but
i
think
that
the
statute
which
says
that
the
commission
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
over
transportation
except
as
it
occurs
in
this
country
or
should
be
confined
to
that
jurisdiction.
let
me
finish
my
point
by
saying
that
of
course,
if
there's
no
tort,
there
can't
be
any
joint
tortfeasor.
without
one
tortfeasor,
there
can't
be
two.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
nor
is
there
anything
to
the
argument
of
convenience
that
an
american
shipper
would
--
if
our
position
were
expounded
have
to
go
to
canada
to
collect
that
portion
of
the
overcharged.
by
definition
in
my
hypothetical,
there
is
no
overcharge
in
canada.
and
therefore,
no
occasion
for
him
to
go,
nor
any
possibility
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
american
carrier
of
obtaining
contributions
because
he
can't
be
reimburse
by
his
canadian
partner.
i
assume
under
canadian
law,
if
the
charge
actually
received
by
the
canadian
carrier
was
wholly
lawful
under
the
laws
of
that
country.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
--
i
grant
that
and
i
do
not
pretend
that
those
decisions
can
be
got
round.
i
do
think
they
deserve
reexamination.
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
if
they
are
all
three
in
serious
that
are
all
are
very
plainly
based
one
on
the
other.
there
is
really
one
decision
here
that
we
must
admit
these
are
reconsideration.
now
as
to
the
disposition
of
this
case,
we
frankly
ought
to
know
how
the
commission
determined
this
maximum
reasonable
international
joint
through
rate.
if
they
did
it
by
attacking
on
an
increment
of
the
canadian
portion
of
the
trip
over
and
above
the
rate
they
found
reasonable
in
consolidated
rendering,
then
there
maybe
no
need
for
a
remand.
on
the
other
hand,
reading
the
commission's
opinion
we
are
unable
to
tackle
perhaps
counsels
for
the
commission
can
enlighten
the
court
as
to
how
that
was
done.
one
final
point,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
can
all
work
the
other
way.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
possible
that
the
charging
canada
will
be
under
canadian
law.
legal,
lawful
and
yet
less
than
would
be
permitted
by
american
law.
now
in
that
instance,
under
the
commission
through
the
total
rate
may
be
reasonable
by
american
standards.
yet,
the
american
carrier
is
over
charging
and
still
under
a
commission
through
is
immune
from
any
reparation.
that
means
to
us
an
unnecessary
of
the
haven
for
improper
wrong.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
will
argue
now.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
it
is
with
reluctance
that
we
find
ourselves
here
taking
at
somewhat
noble
position
and
urging
the
court
to
overturn
some
50
years
more
or
less
consistent
practices
by
the
commission
and
also
in
some
sense
three
decisions
of
this
court.
perhaps
if
the
court
had
been
invited
our
views,
we
would
have
let
this
matter
sleep
for
another
50
years.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
can
be
so
viewed
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
decisions
are
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
there
is
that
element
--
there
is
that
obstacle
here
but
i
must
say
that
in
all
three
of
the
decisions,
they
are
all
suggestions
as
to
mean
through
which
the
railroad
can
avoid.
it's
my
ability
for
the
entire
trip
suggestions
which
we
cannot
fully
understand
because
one
of
them
is
not
consistent
with
position
taken
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
a
position
as
to
which
all
counsel
here
are
agreed
that
is
that
seems
to
be
a
suggestion
that,
if
only
the
railroad
had
published
an
alternative
rate
to
the
border.
then
it
would
not
have
been
liable
for
the
entire
reparation
due
on
the
joint
through
rate.
yet,
this
court
has
held
and
the
commission
has
consistently
held
that
there
can
only
be
one
rate
available
to
a
particular
shipper
or
a
particular
shipment.
therefore
that
alternative
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
a
real
one.
now,
since
that
is
part
of
the
premise
of
these
decisions,
it
is
difficult
to
follow
the
decisions
get
through
of
any
of
that
and
that
may
give
less
reluctance
in
qualifying
them
or
overturning
them
at
this
great
day.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
what
i'm
really
suggesting
is
that
congress
also
may
have
been
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
decisions
and
it
may
not
be
altogether
fair
to
attribute
to
congress
any
clear
understanding
of
then
that
we
have
now.
in
connection
with
the
your
honor's
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
suggesting
that
it
would
be
imposing
on
the
commission
a
very
heavy
additional
beauty
by
requiring
it
to
find
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
answer
is
that
it
would
impose
no
additional
duty
whatever.
instead
of
finding
a
reasonable
international
joint
though
rate
which
the
commission
had
done
in
this
case
and
would
under
its
practice
do
in
every
such
case.
it
would
instead
not
in
addition
but
instead
find
the
maximum
reasonable
proportional
rate
to
the
border.
a
thing
which
it
would
seem
to
us
to
be
an
easier
operations
since
we're
dealing
with
the
familiar
american
carriers,
familiar
american
cars,
familiar
american
territory
and
not
looking
somewhat
blindly
over
the
border
in
canada
which
is
necessary
aspect
to
determine
in
the
total
reasonable
rate.
so
there
is
no
problem
of
imposing
additional
burden
on
the
commission.
i
should
say
perhaps
also
at
the
outset
that
we
could
not
agree
with
the
respondents
--
there
attempt
to
distinguished
these
three
decisions
of
the
court.
because
we
have
the
same
difficulty
that
i
think
it
was
voice
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
cannot
see
really
what
difference
it
makes
if
there
is
an
additional
rate
published
to
the
border,
especially,
if
that
additional
rate
to
the
border
is
not
available
to
this
particular
shipper.
if
he's
compelled
where
there
is
a
joint
through
rate
to
ship
to
pay
that
charge
then
its
more
comfort
to
the
shipper
that
there
is
another
rate
which
that
can
give
that.
it
is
true
that
the
commission's
finding
as
to
this
other
rate
if
it
has
been
done
independently
in
a
prior
proceeding,
may
furnish
evidence
of
what
that
portion
of
the
trip,
what
charge
should
be
meet
to
that
portion
of
the
trip.
and
to
that
extent,
here
the
carrier
cannot
be
taxed
with
having
failed
to
enlighten
the
commission
as
to
an
alternative
way
of
computing
reparations
because
the
commission
itself
perhaps
if
this
consolidated
rendering
case
is
appropriate
--
it
is
an
appropriate
then
had
already
found
on
its
own
such
a
standard.
and
therefore
there
is
no
need
for
the
carrier
to
make
that
choice
to
the
extent
that
those
early
decisions
of
this
court
rest
on
a
default
of
the
carrier
that
show
the
commission,
how
else
to
go
about
accessing
reparations,
this
may
be
a
distinguishable
case.
however
as
we
say,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
every
case
the
maximum
allowable
reparation
is
with
respect
to
the
american
portion
of
the
trip.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
american
portion
of
the
trip
that
is
put
it
in
simpler
terms
perhaps
the
american
carrier
on
international
journey
ought
to
be
made
to
disgorge
only
so
much
as
he
had
pocketed
that
is
the
excess
the
amount
pocketed.
he
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
what
i
mean
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
the
commission
can
go
no
further
from
this.
now,
i
think
we
all
begin
with
the
common
ground
that
the
commission's
only
proper
concern
is
to
regulate
rail
transportation
in
the
united
states.
i
think
that's
very
plainly
what
the
statute
says.
that
is
that
the
parties
we're
concerned
here
to
prevent
or
to
provide
a
remedy
for
excessive
charges
made
by
rail
carriers
in
this
country.
it
has
no
concern
with
the
conduct
to
all
the
charges
imposed
by
canadian
railroad
in
canada
or
mexican
railroads
or
mexico.
nor
is
this
surprising
that
short
of
extra
territorial
jurisdiction
might
prevent
serious
questions.
nor
is
the
commission
had
report
to
have
an
expertise
about
conditions
in
foreign
countries
or
of
the
conditions
that
foreign
carriers.
here
is
may
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
commission
does
not
claim
any
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
fortas
to
prescribe
joint
through
international
rates.
on
the
contrary,
recognizes
that
it
has
no
such
authority
and
yet,
it
is
willing
or
fix
it
must
have
those,
judge
what
it
cannot
control
and
that
is
judge
the
reasonableness
of
the
charge
made
for
the
canadian
portion
of
the
traffic.
eventhough
it
concedes
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
control
that
judge
regularly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
i
frankly
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
figures
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
made
that
finding
solely
for
the
purpose
of
computing
the
reparation.
it
concedes
that
cannot
prescribe
that
rate
as
the
international
rate
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
we
take
first
of
those
positions
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
say
that
each
neither
can
it
prescribe
the
international
joint
though
rate
nor
can
it
judge
the
reasonableness
of
an
international
joint
through
rate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
would
it
involve
within
the
judging
what
is
beyond
its
proper
concern.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you're
entirely
right,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
is
our
position.
perhaps
our
brief
doesn't
isn't
officially
emphatic
on
that
point.
well,
the
basic
fallacy
here
it
seems
to
us
is
judging
the
reasonableness
of
an
international
rate
part
of
which
occurs
in
canada
and
yet,
the
commission
judges
it
under
american
standards
which
are
legally
inapplicable
and
otherwise,
inappropriate
to
transportation
in
canada
which
is
subject
to
a
canadian
law
and
a
canadian
commission
under
wholly
different
standards.
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
by
american
standards
an
international
joint
through
rate
is
unreasonable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
see
no
reason
to
prohibit
and
i
think
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
act
does
not
prohibit
the
entering
into
such
joint
international
rates.
nor
that
we
think
there
is
any
public
interest
on
the
contrary
and
in
discouraging
the
entering
into
such
joint
international
rates
which
normally
have
benefits
to
shippers.
so,
recognizing
the
virtue
of
joint
rates
and
yet
the
inability
of
the
commission
to
judge
them.
we
have
attempted
to
device
a
way
in
which
these
two
principles
can
be
accommodated
and
yet
the
shipper
can
receive
full
reparation
from
the
american
carrier
to
the
extent
that
the
american
carrier
is
responsible
for
the
open
charge.
and
at
the
same
time
the
carrier
is
not
deterred
from
entering
into
these
joint
rates
by
being
told
that
when
he
does
then
he
must
spare
the
entire
reparation
award
eventhough
his
canadian
partner
is
responsible
for
a
large
share
of
it.
and
incidentally,
his
canadian
partner,
his
mexican
partner
maybe
the
government
of
canada
or
the
government
of
mexico.
one
of
the
railroads
in
this
case
is
owned
by
the
government
of
canada
and
as
i
understand
it,
most
mexican
railroads
internationalized.
now,
under
their
law
it
may
be
--
it
might
be
surprising
particularly
would
be
contrary
to
the
normal
presumption
to
suppose
that
the
government
of
canada
or
the
government
of
mexico
allows
its
own
railroad
to
over
charge.
therefore,
if
even
proper
to
have
permission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
surprise
me
to
have
--
i
think
it's
necessary
to
have
a
commission
pass
on
the
rate
of
nationalize
railroad
for
all
those
have
those
rates
administratively
determine
in
the
first
instance
that
a
correct
standards.
i
think
that
probably
is
the
situation
in
mexico.
when
you
have
both
private
and
public
carriers
that
are
in
canada
and
probably
both
subject
to
the
board
and
treated
very
much
alike.
now,
let
me
made
clear
that
our
position
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
bar
on
the
commission's
poaching
into
canadian
territory
should
result
in
any
injuries
or
inability
by
the
shipper
to
obtain
full
reparation
from
the
american
carrier
to
the
extent
that
the
american
carriers
are
responsible
for
that
excessive
charge.
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know,
this
record
does
not
disclose
mr.
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
if
that
the
--
it
is
ordinarily
done.
it
is
a
jointly
agreed
tariffs
and
the
divisions
between
the
roads
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
subject
to
this
that
he
may
ask
the
commission.
i
understand
the
commission's
practice
it
will
if
it
--
commission
goes
a
differently
than
we
would
but
if
they
find
that
the
american
carriers
we
would
put
it's
overcharging
--
receiving
too
much
money
for
his
portion
of
this
joint
transportation.
they
can
require
him
to
withdraw
from
this
particular
tariff.
now,
the
commission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
but
that
is
this
--
the
commission's
owned
recognition
of
the
limitation
of
the
jurisdiction.
and--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
cannot
describe
a
new
law
joint
through
rate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
i
assume
your
honor's
question
is
directed
to
this
solution
that
we
would
propose
to
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
--
it
seems
to
us
that
whether
--
let
me
say
that
might
be
two
alternatives
so,
one
is
to
have
the
american
commission
governing
transportation
heading
north
in
the
case
of
canada.
and
canada
is
doing
it
when
its
point
of
origin
is
in
canada.
as
i
understand
at
one
time
the
commission,
american
commission
and
the
canadian
commission
informally
or
perhaps
formally
agreed
to
this
sort
of
exchange
in
jurisdiction
that
is
clearly
no
longer
in
effect
because
the
american
commission
purports
to
regulate
reparation
purposes
in
both
directions.
but
even
there
their
all
the
problems
we
see
here
and
it
would
seem
to
us.
we
don't
see
any
real
problem
with
a
legislative
solution
of
the
kind
we
suggest
here
as
open
on
the
present
statute.
the
statute
very
clearly
says
and
it
now
reads,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
foreign
transportation
what
one
so
long
--
only
in
so
far
as
the
transportation
occurs
in
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
it
occurs
within
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
the
suggestion
is
that
this
is
meaningless
if
the
commission's
jurisdiction
or
all
perhaps
this
adopts
the
border.
it
seems
to
me
the
plain
purpose
of
this
provision
of
statute
is
to
cover
what
might
otherwise
be
intrastate
transportation
and
therefore
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
congress.
a
shipment
destined
for
a
foreign
country
eventhough
it
only
travels
through
one
state
is
foreign
commerce.
yet,
it
can
be
regulated
only
to
the
border.
it
seems
to
be
that's
reason
enough
to
have
this
provision
in
the
statute
and
that
is
all
it
was
meant
to
provide.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
just
simple
as
that
mr.
justice
black
and
that's
--
that's
what
we'd
expect
to
find
an
american
commission
limited
to
and
since
it
works
since
it
can
work.
there's
nothing
unworkable
about
that
limitation.
we
don't
see
why
it
shouldn't
be
the
practical
rule
for
reparations
purposes
as
it
is
for
rate
making
purposes.
let
me
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
our
suggestion
is
that
it
did
not
present
an
insuperable
problem.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
--
i
don't
know
that's
inhibitively,
i
suppose
it
can
be
made
either
by
the
ship
or
the
consignee?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
there
is
or
let
me
say
if
your
honor
fully
appreciates
that
is
the
reverse
of
this
case
where
its
rather
ironic
for
the
canadian
consignee
to
be
coming
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rather
that
its
own
courts
and
to
the
claiming
reparations
from
the
american
carrier
or
all
of
them
the
persons
he
dealt
with,
the
canadian.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
returning
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
even
if
it
were
as
your
honor
puts
in
the
hypothetical
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
assume
unrealistically
that
the
american
carrier
was
in
full
control
of
the
rate
to
be
charge
to
the
point
of
destination.
or
it
would
involve
the
commission
as
i
say
in
judging
reasonableness
beyond
the
border.
now
for
purposes
of
liability
for
damage
on
the
goods
that
is
the
rule
mr.
justice
fortas
and
there
there's
certainly
no
objection
to
it.
but
for
purposes
of
awarding
reparations
which
unfortunately
involves
this
element
of
judging
the
reasonableness
of
rate,
it
becomes
unfair
and
the
unfinished
may
not
always
be
against
the
carrier.
it's
maybe
unfair
to
the
shipper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
--
that
is
true
and
that
is
explicitly
provided
for
in
the
statutes
and
we
take
that
as
a
legislative
indication
that
when
there
is
extra
territorial
jurisdiction
as
it
worked.
the
congress
has
been
careful
in
this
act
to
expressly
provide
for
it.
let
me
say
one
word
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
really
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
would
strongly
doubt
it.
i
don't
think
this
problem
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
i
don't
pretend
that
it
is
a
very
momentous
problem
as
has
been
said.
as
far
as
i
know
or
wholly
accurately
the
commission
has
been
using
another
formula
for
many
years
and
it
has
not
created
very
upsetting
problems.
on
other
hand,
when
this
court
after
40
years
has
decided
to
take
another
look
at
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
existing
system
while
tolerable
in
some
sense
does
not
make
sense.
it
is
not
--
does
not
conform
to
the
statute
is
unfair
both
to
shippers
and
the
carriers
in
different
situations.
and
that
it
should
not
be
perpetuated
eventhough
the
world
would
not
come
to
an
end
if
it
were.
now,
it's
just
this
simply
has
been
no
occasions
for
the
executive
branch
to
address
itself
to
this
problem
and
therefore
no
suggestion
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
the
points
of
your
suggestion.
i
--
all
i
can
say
in
defense
of
our
position
here
is
that
we
felt
this
was
not
a
matter
of
the
congress.
this
congress
had
already
spoken
rather
plainly
as
to
where
the
line
was
drawn.no
one
has
much
notice
of
that
the
commission
has
step
over
that
line.
now,
this
court
has
condoned
it
and
grant
the
serious
obstacles
that
are
presented
by
this
court's
prior
decision.
all
i
can
say
about
them
is
that
the
--
we
submit
they
were
wrongly
decided
and
should
be
reexamined.
they
rest
on
the
joint
tortfeasor
doctrine
and
i
think
if
i
could
demonstrate
the
inapplicability
of
that
doctrine
here.
the
force
of
those
decisions
might
be
somewhat
lesser.
the
joint
tortfeasor
doctrine
in
this
situation,
unlike
the
domestic
carriage
situation
rests
on
the
premise
that
a
tort
has
been
committed
and
when
we
ask
where
the
tort
has
been
committed,
it
must
be
in
canada.
now,
it
must
be
in
canada
because
the
theory
of
the
decision
of
this
but
it
doesn't
matter
where
it
happened
so
long
as
these
two
partners
have
joined
in
creating
it
--
in
creating
an
excessive
rate
which
may
be
excessive
only
because
the
canadian
portion
of
it
is
excessive
by
american
standards.
then
the
tort
for
the
purpose
of
my
hypothetical
at
least,
occurred
in
canada.
now
it's
all
the
strange
notion
that
an
american
commission
should
be
deciding
whether
a
canadian
company
in
canada
committed
a
tort
and
worst
by
applying
american
law.
if
we
were
to
apply
canadian
law
eventhough
at
the
present
problems
of
the
american
commission
not
being
expert
in
canadian
law
and
the
suggestion
that
it
might
lead
that
question
better
to
the
canadian
authority.
at
least
there
would
no
problem
about
finding
the
tort.
but
here
by
hypothesis,
we
have
a
rate
which
is
legal,
lawful
in
canada
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
which
is
lawful
under
canadian
standards.
but
which
by
american
standards
is
too
high.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
black,
the
american
commission
does
not
follow
up
expressly
say
and
i
suppose
that
counsel
will
confirm
it.
that
when
the
judge
the
international
joint
through
rate
for
the
canadian
as
for
the
american
portion,
they
applied
american
standards.
they
wholly
disregard
the
canadian
law
and
the
committee
--
canadian
commissions
prescriptions
of
the
rate
for
that
portion
of
the
transportation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
they
would
be
best
advised
to
say
are
we
all
together
since
it
isn't
necessary.
the
difficulty
is
involved
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
the
solution
we
suggest
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
court
is
not
only
free
to
do
it
but
i
think
that
the
statute
which
says
that
the
commission
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
over
transportation
except
as
it
occurs
in
this
country
or
should
be
confined
to
that
jurisdiction.
let
me
finish
my
point
by
saying
that
of
course,
if
there's
no
tort,
there
can't
be
any
joint
tortfeasor.
without
one
tortfeasor,
there
can't
be
two.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
nor
is
there
anything
to
the
argument
of
convenience
that
an
american
shipper
would
--
if
our
position
were
expounded
have
to
go
to
canada
to
collect
that
portion
of
the
overcharged.
by
definition
in
my
hypothetical,
there
is
no
overcharge
in
canada.
and
therefore,
no
occasion
for
him
to
go,
nor
any
possibility
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
american
carrier
of
obtaining
contributions
because
he
can't
be
reimburse
by
his
canadian
partner.
i
assume
under
canadian
law,
if
the
charge
actually
received
by
the
canadian
carrier
was
wholly
lawful
under
the
laws
of
that
country.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
--
i
grant
that
and
i
do
not
pretend
that
those
decisions
can
be
got
round.
i
do
think
they
deserve
reexamination.
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
if
they
are
all
three
in
serious
that
are
all
are
very
plainly
based
one
on
the
other.
there
is
really
one
decision
here
that
we
must
admit
these
are
reconsideration.
now
as
to
the
disposition
of
this
case,
we
frankly
ought
to
know
how
the
commission
determined
this
maximum
reasonable
international
joint
through
rate.
if
they
did
it
by
attacking
on
an
increment
of
the
canadian
portion
of
the
trip
over
and
above
the
rate
they
found
reasonable
in
consolidated
rendering,
then
there
maybe
no
need
for
a
remand.
on
the
other
hand,
reading
the
commission's
opinion
we
are
unable
to
tackle
perhaps
counsels
for
the
commission
can
enlighten
the
court
as
to
how
that
was
done.
one
final
point,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
can
all
work
the
other
way.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
possible
that
the
charging
canada
will
be
under
canadian
law.
legal,
lawful
and
yet
less
than
would
be
permitted
by
american
law.
now
in
that
instance,
under
the
commission
through
the
total
rate
may
be
reasonable
by
american
standards.
yet,
the
american
carrier
is
over
charging
and
still
under
a
commission
through
is
immune
from
any
reparation.
that
means
to
us
an
unnecessary
of
the
haven
for
improper
wrong.
