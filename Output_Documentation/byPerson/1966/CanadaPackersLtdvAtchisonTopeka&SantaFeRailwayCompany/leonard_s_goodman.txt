mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
believe
i
was
to
follow
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
appears
here
as
an
amicus
curiae,
respectfully
opposing
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general
on
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
order
appellee
railroads
to
pay
reparation
to
the
appellant
shipper
on
basis
of
the
entire
joint
rate,
the
shipper
was
charged
from
origins
in
the
united
states
to
canada.
the
solicitor
general
states
that
the
basis
fallacy
of
the
commission's
decision
it
is
judging
the
reasonableness
of
international
rates
and
as
i
recall
mr.
justice
black
also
oppose
the
problem
of
regulating
rates
in
canada.
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
porter
case
decided
by
this
court
in
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
in
1961.
there
the
commission
considered
the
entire
joint
rate
from
canada
to
the
united
states
found
discrimination
in
the
entire
rate
in
order
the
american
carriers
to
end
it.
this
court
sustained
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
what
standard
the
commission
used?
commission
compared
rates
in
that
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
commission
compared
the
rates
in
that
case.
compare
the
rates
from
canadian
origins
to
the
united
states
with
combination
rates
that
applied
from
canadian
origins
to
other
points
in
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
commission
didn't
attempt
to
change
the
law.
the
commission
attempted
however
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
railroads
operating
here
in
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
black,
were
discriminating
against
members
of
the
shipping
public.
and
when
it
found
such
discrimination
based
upon
considering
the
entire
joint
rate.
the
commission
ordered
the
american
carriers
to
end
such
discrimination.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
commission
wasn't
concerned
with
whether
the
portion
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
--
within
canada
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
commission
look
at
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
only
thin
i
can
suggest
is
the
commission
look
at
the
entire
rate.
the
entire
rate
charge
the
shipper.
it
was
only
the
applicable
rate.
the
commission
did
not
seek
to
fragment
that
rate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it's
also
governed
by
united
states
law.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
insofar
as
the
american
carriers
participated
in
that
rate
is
governed
by
american
law.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
that's
true.
to
this
limited
extent.
the
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
transportation
“from
or
to”
any
place
in
the
united
states,
to
or
from
a
foreign
country.
now,
this
is
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce
and
to
the
extent
that
the
american
carriers
participate
in
that
commerce.
they
are
subject
to
the
standard
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
proviso
which
reads
only
insofar
as
such
transportation
takes
place
within
united
states
refers
to
the
limiting
the
commission's
orders
to
the
american
carrier.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
that's
true
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
think
it's
true
under
the
antitrust
laws,
yes,
just
because
of
certain
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
--
conduct
occurs
abroad.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh,
i'm
sorry.
because
some
of
the
conduct
of
american
carriers
occurs
abroad
does
not
exempt
those
carriers
from
the
standards
of
interstate
commerce
act.
this
court
has
so
held
in
antitrust
cases.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
has
suggested
in
its
amicus
brief
that
the
statute
grants
it
a
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
commerce
engaged
in
by
railroads
subject
to
a
proviso
which
limits
this
jurisdiction
personally,
to
carriers
american
or
foreign
which
performs
some
transportation
within
the
united
states.
now,
we
left
off
yesterday
with
considering
this
court's
opinion
in
the
porter
case,
decided
in
1961,
where
the
commission
compared
the
entire
three
rates
from
canada
to
the
united
states,
found
discrimination
in
the
entire
rate
and
ordered
the
carriers
performing
transportation
in
the
united
states
to
end
the
discrimination.
the
canadian
national
was
exempted
from
that
decision
for
example
since
that
that
commission
stated,
“no
transportation
within
the
united
states
was
performed
by
that
carrier.”
this
court
sustained
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
on
the
grounds
it
was
enough
that
the
order
ran
against
the
american
carriers.
here,
the
commission
likewise
considers
the
entire
rate
applicable
in
foreign
commerce
and
limits
its
order
to
run
only
insofar
as
the
transportation
takes
place
in
the
united
states.
if
the
case
had
involved
future
rates,
rather
than
only
past
rates,
the
commission
would
not
have
prescribed
a
rate
for
application
within
canada
but
again
would
have
entered
an
order
requiring
american
carriers
to
seize
participation
in
unlawful
rates.
in
all
events,
orders
entered
by
the
commission
in
its
supervision
of
foreign
commerce
engaged
in
by
railroads
are
so
drawn
as
to
effect
directly
only
the
transportation
occurring
in
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
statute.
one
consistently
adopted
for
56
years
an
interpretation
that
is
worth
well
in
practice
and
one
that
should
not
be
disturbed.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
mr.
myers
yesterday,
but
isn't
the
commission
requiring
american
carriers
to
pay
the
shipper
more
than
the
carrier
received
as
an
overpayment.
our
answer
is
an
equivocal
yes.
the
division
of
the
rate
agreed
upon
by
the
carriers
is
of
no
concern
to
the
shipper.
he
is
entitled
to
full
damages
from
anyone
of
the
carriers
participating
in
the
agreed
upon
joint
rate.
in
the
porter
case,
the
commission
required
american
carriers
to
police
the
international
rates
for
discrimination.
here,
it
requires
them
to
police
past
rates
for
unjustness
and
unreasonableness.
rather
than
place
the
burden
on
the
shipper,
to
bring
two
suits
to
recover
his
damage,
in
this
case,
a
canadian
suit
would
involve
less
than
$1,400.00.
the
commission
allows
one
suit
and
is
held
for
56
years
that
if
the
american
carriers
entitled
to
contribution,
it
should
work
that
out
with
its
canadian
counterpart.
we
find
no
recorded
cases
over
contribution
in
this
half
century
of
experience
under
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
now,
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
the
commission
disregard
canadian
law
and
mr.
justice
fortas
also
asked
as
i
recall
what
part
would
the
icc
determination
play
in
canada.
well,
we
have
just
cited
and
discussed
on
brief
the
early
stoy
cases
which
held
that
the
canadian
commission
if
suit
were
brought
there
in
the
first
instance
would
approach
the
case
exactly
as
the
commission
has
done
and
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
entire
rate.
canada
would
not
go
bound
by
the
icc
determination
and
we
are
not
bound
by
their
determination.
in
our
view,
the
statute
grants
the
commission
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce
and
the
commission
may
grant
relief
to
shippers
injured
by
railroads
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
so
long
as
they
perform
some
transportation
in
the
united
states.
the
act
the
commission
administers
is
of
course
a
product
of
much
history.
the
original
act
of
1887
did
not
contain
the
proviso
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
along
which
the
solicitor
general
relies.
in
the
black
horse
tobacco
case
of
1910,
the
entire
commission
explained
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce,
one,
to
issue
a
seize
and
desist
order
to
require
american
carriers
to
stop
applying
an
unlawful
joint
rate
on
traffic
into
mexico;
and
two,
to
order
reparation
be
paid
on
the
entire
through
rate
since
the
american
carriers
were
jointly
and
severally
responsible
for
all
unlawfulness
in
such
rates.
during
the
hearings
on
the
transportation
act
of
1920
which
involved
a
complete
rewriting
and
reorganization
of
the
act,
this
position
was
explained
to
congress
and
in
adding
the
proviso
to
section
1,
the
report
of
the
house
committee
states
it
was
adding
and
i
quote,
“minor
corrections
in
clarifying
the
language
in
several
respects
but
makes
no
important
change
in
policy.”
the
commission
continued
in
the
international
nickel
company
case
of
1922
to
require
that
reparation
be
paid
on
the
entire
international
joint
rate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
doesn't
matter
which
way
the
traffic
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
only
vaguely
recall
some
comment
during
hearings.
i
believe
it
was
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
my
memory
is
very
vague
on
this.
it
might
have
been
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920
where
some
comment
was
made
that
an
informal
agreement
had
been
tried
to
be
reached
between
the
governments
concerning
a
division
of
responsibility
on
these
rates
and
no
agreement
could
be
reached
whether
this
meant
that
there
had
been
some
dispute
between
the
governments,
i
could
not
tell
from
that
and
certainly
this
comment
did
not
go
very
far.
no
legislation
was
introduced.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
have
no
official
knowledge
of
what
happens.
the
commission
does
not
receive
copies
of
the
divisions
filed
by
the
carriers
and
has
no
role
to
play.unofficially,
i
am
told
that
the
carriers
do
work
this
out
informally
between
themselves
to
their
reviewers.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
practice
of
which
i
speak
has
been
continuously
followed
since
1910
and
later,
it
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
court
proceedings,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
yes,
very
often.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
indeed.
it
was
mr.
chief
justice's
practice
of
commissioner's
report
to
congress
as
late
as
1962
and
i've
cited
in
our
brief
the
next
draft
from
hearings
held
in
1962
in
which
we
explained
to
congress
what
we
were
doing.
finally,
the
solicitor
general
invokes
considerations
of
committee,
equity
and
practicality.
they
too
we
believe
support
the
jurisdiction
exercise
consistently
by
the
commission
since
1910.
we
might
suggest
under
the
heading
of
committee
that
first
canada
recognizes
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
exercises
a
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
our
good
relations
are
effective
in
any
way
with
canada.
under
the
heading
of
equity,
we
would
submit
that
the
solicitor
general's
approach
would
require
the
shippers
to
bring
separate
suits
in
the
united
states
and
canada
on
often
very
small
claims.
and
under
the
heading
of
practicality,
as
i
recall
yesterday,
solicitor
general
stated
to
this
court
that
the
commission's
interpretation
has
not
created
very
upsetting
problems
in
response
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry.
in
response
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
as
i
recall,
the
solicitor
general
did
state
yesterday
that
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
statute
has
not
created
very
upsetting
problems.
indeed,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
commission's
practice
has
in
any
way
discouraged
the
filing
of
joint
rates.
on
the
other
hand,
the
solicitor
general's
solution
would
raise
a
host
of
practical
problems.
now,
we
address
ourselves
on
brief
to
the
weaknesses
of
using
divisions
as
a
standard
for
measuring
the
shipper's
damage
resulting
from
an
unlawful
rate.
i
will
not
repeat
those
comments.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
commission's
consistent
interpretation
of
its
jurisdiction
for
over
half
a
century
approved
by
this
court
in
three
opinions
reported
to
congress
an
exercise
with
the
apparent
approval
of
congress
should
be
sustained
and
we
ask
the
order
of
the
district
court
be
reinstated.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
we
do.
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
summation
of
the
solicitor
general's
approach
too.
they
would
disagree
with
the
rationale,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
believe
i
was
to
follow
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
appears
here
as
an
amicus

respectfully
opposing
the
views
of

on

of
the
entire
joint
rate,
the
shipper

in
the

to

the
solicitor

states
that
the

of
the

decision
it
is
judging
the
reasonableness
of
international
rates
and
as
i
recall
mr.

also
oppose
the

to
the

found
discrimination
in
the
entire

in

this

sustained
the

mr.

the
commission
attempted
however
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
railroads
operating
here
in
the

mr.
justice
black,
were
discriminating
against
members
of
the
shipping

and
when
it
found
such
discrimination
based
upon
considering
the
entire
joint
rate.
the
commission
ordered
the
american
carriers
to
end
such
discrimination.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
commission
wasn't
concerned
with
whether

--
mr.
leonard

--

--
mr.

it
was
only
the
applicable

the
commission
did
not
seek
to

mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
mr.
leonard

it's
also
governed

mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
insofar
as
the
american

participated
in
that
rate
is
governed
by
american
law.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
that's
true.
to
this
limited
extent.
the
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce.
the

speaks
in
terms
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
transportation
“from

any
place
in
the
united

country.
now,
this
is
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce
and
to
the
extent
that
the
american
carriers
participate
in
that
commerce.
they
are
subject
to
the
standard
of
the
interstate

act.
the
proviso
which
reads
only
insofar
as
such

takes
place
within

states
refers
to
the
limiting
the
commission's
orders
to
the
american
carrier.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
that's
true
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
think
it's
true
under
the
antitrust
laws,
yes,
just
because
of
certain
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
--
conduct
occurs
abroad.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh,
i'm
sorry.
because
some
of
the
conduct
of
american
carriers
occurs
abroad
does
not
exempt
those
carriers
from
the
standards
of
interstate
commerce
act.
this
court
has
so
held
in
antitrust
cases.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief

may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
has

in
the
porter
case,
decided
in
1961,
where
the
commission
compared
the
entire
three
rates
from
canada
to
the
united
states,
found
discrimination
in
the
entire
rate
and
ordered
the
carriers
performing
transportation
in
the
united
states
to
end
the
discrimination.
the
canadian
national
was
exempted
from
that
decision
for
example
since
that
that
commission
stated,
“no
transportation
within
the
united
states
was
performed
by
that
carrier.”
this
court
sustained
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
on
the
grounds
it
was
enough
that
the
order
ran
against
the
american
carriers.
here,
the
commission
likewise
considers
the
entire
rate
applicable
in
foreign
commerce
and
limits
its
order
to
run
only
insofar
as
the
transportation
takes
place
in
the
united
states.
if
the
case
had
involved
future
rates,
rather
than
only
past
rates,
the
commission
would
not
have
prescribed
a
rate
for
application
within
canada
but
again
would
have
entered
an
order
requiring
american
carriers
to
seize
participation
in
unlawful
rates.
in
all
events,
orders
entered
by
the
commission
in
its
supervision
of
foreign
commerce
engaged
in
by
railroads
are
so
drawn
as
to
effect
directly
only
the
transportation
occurring
in
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
statute.
one
consistently
adopted
for
56
years
an
interpretation
that
is
worth
well
in
practice
and
one
that
should
not
be
disturbed.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
mr.
myers
yesterday,
but
isn't
the
commission
requiring
american
carriers
to
pay
the
shipper
more
than
the
carrier
received
as
an
overpayment.
our
answer
is
an
equivocal
yes.
the
division
of
the
rate
agreed
upon
by
the
carriers
is
of
no
concern
to
the
shipper.
he
is
entitled
to
full
damages
from
anyone
of
the
carriers
participating
in
the
agreed
upon
joint
rate.
in
the
porter
case,
the
commission
required
american
carriers
to
police
the
international
rates
for
discrimination.
here,
it
requires
them
to
police
past
rates
for
unjustness
and
unreasonableness.
rather
than
place
the
burden
on
the
shipper,
to
bring
two
suits
to
recover
his
damage,
in
this
case,
a
canadian
suit
would
involve
less
than
$1,400.00.
the
commission
allows
one
suit
and
is
held
for
56
years
that
if
the
american
carriers
entitled
to
contribution,
it
should
work
that
out
with
its
canadian
counterpart.
we
find
no
recorded
cases
over
contribution
in
this
half
century
of
experience
under
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
now,
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
the
commission
disregard
canadian
law
and
mr.
justice
fortas
also
asked
as
i
recall
what
part
would
the
icc
determination
play
in
canada.
well,
we
have
just
cited
and
discussed
on
brief
the
early
stoy
cases
which
held
that
the
canadian
commission
if
suit
were
brought
there
in
the
first
instance
would
approach
the
case
exactly
as
the
commission
has
done
and
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
entire
rate.
canada
would
not
go
bound
by
the
icc
determination
and
we
are
not
bound
by
their
determination.
in
our
view,
the
statute
grants
the
commission
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce
and
the
commission
may
grant
relief
to
shippers
injured
by
railroads
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
so
long
as
they
perform
some
transportation
in
the
united
states.
the
act
the
commission
administers
is
of
course
a
product
of
much
history.
the
original
act
of
1887
did
not
contain
the
proviso
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
along
which
the
solicitor
general
relies.
in
the
black
horse
tobacco
case
of
1910,
the
entire
commission
explained
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
foreign
commerce,
one,
to
issue
a
seize
and
desist
order
to
require
american
carriers
to
stop
applying
an
unlawful
joint
rate
on
traffic
into
mexico;
and
two,
to
order
reparation
be
paid
on
the
entire
through
rate
since
the
american
carriers
were
jointly
and
severally
responsible
for
all
unlawfulness
in
such
rates.
during
the
hearings
on
the
transportation
act
of
1920
which
involved
a
complete
rewriting
and
reorganization
of
the
act,
this
position
was
explained
to
congress
and
in
adding
the
proviso
to
section
1,
the
report
of
the
house
committee
states
it
was
adding
and
i
quote,
“minor
corrections
in
clarifying
the
language
in
several
respects
but
makes
no
important
change
in
policy.”
the
commission
continued
in
the
international
nickel
company
case
of
1922
to
require
that
reparation
be
paid
on
the
entire
international
joint
rate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
doesn't
matter
which
way
the
traffic
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
only
vaguely
recall
some
comment
during
hearings.
i
believe
it
was
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
my
memory
is
very
vague
on
this.
it
might
have
been
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920
where
some
comment
was
made
that
an
informal
agreement
had
been
tried
to
be
reached
between
the
governments
concerning
a
division
of
responsibility
on
these
rates
and
no
agreement
could
be
reached
whether
this
meant
that
there
had
been
some
dispute
between
the
governments,
i
could
not
tell
from
that
and
certainly
this
comment
did
not
go
very
far.
no
legislation
was
introduced.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
have
no
official
knowledge
of
what
happens.
the
commission
does
not
receive
copies
of
the
divisions
filed
by
the
carriers
and
has
no
role
to
play.unofficially,
i
am
told
that
the
carriers
do
work
this
out
informally
between
themselves
to
their
reviewers.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
practice
of
which
i
speak
has
been
continuously
followed
since
1910
and
later,
it
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
court
proceedings,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
yes,
very
often.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
indeed.
it
was
mr.
chief
justice's
practice
of
commissioner's
report
to
congress
as
late
as
1962
and
i've
cited
in
our
brief
the
next
draft
from
hearings
held
in
1962
in
which
we
explained
to
congress
what
we
were
doing.
finally,
the
solicitor
general
invokes
considerations
of
committee,
equity
and
practicality.
they
too
we
believe
support
the
jurisdiction
exercise
consistently
by
the
commission
since
1910.
we
might
suggest
under
the
heading
of
committee
that
first
canada
recognizes
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
exercises
a
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
our
good
relations
are
effective
in
any
way
with
canada.
under
the
heading
of
equity,
we
would
submit
that
the
solicitor
general's
approach
would
require
the
shippers
to
bring
separate
suits
in
the
united
states
and
canada
on
often
very
small
claims.
and
under
the
heading
of
practicality,
as
i
recall
yesterday,
solicitor
general
stated
to
this
court
that
the
commission's
interpretation
has
not
created
very
upsetting
problems
in
response
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry.
in
response
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
as
i
recall,
the
solicitor
general
did
state
yesterday
that
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
statute
has
not
created
very
upsetting
problems.
indeed,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
commission's
practice
has
in
any
way
discouraged
the
filing
of
joint
rates.
on
the
other
hand,
the
solicitor
general's
solution
would
raise
a
host
of
practical
problems.
now,
we
address
ourselves
on
brief
to
the
weaknesses
of
using
divisions
as
a
standard
for
measuring
the
shipper's
damage
resulting
from
an
unlawful
rate.
i
will
not
repeat
those
comments.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
commission's
consistent
interpretation
of
its
jurisdiction
for
over
half
a
century
approved
by
this
court
in
three
opinions
reported
to
congress
an
exercise
with
the
apparent
approval
of
congress
should
be
sustained
and
we
ask
the
order
of
the
district
court
be
reinstated.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
we
do.
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
summation
of
the
solicitor
general's
approach
too.
they
would
disagree
with
the
rationale,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
