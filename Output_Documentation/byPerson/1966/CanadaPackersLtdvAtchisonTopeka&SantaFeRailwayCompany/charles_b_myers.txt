mr.
charles
b.
myers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
to
what
extent
does
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
jurisdiction
to
make
an
award
of
reparation
to
a
shipper,
who
has
been
required
to
pay
unreasonably
high
joint
through
international
rates
on
its
traffic
from
points
in
the
united
states
to
points
of
canada?
this
case
had
its
origin
in
an
informal
complaint
which
we
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
1950.
that
complaint
alleged
that
the
international
through
rates
from
carlsbad
and
loving,
new
mexico
to
our
plants
at
toronto
in
welland
and
ontario
province
and
in
--
at
montreal
in
quebec
province,
and
at
saint
john
in
brunswick
were
unreasonable
and
we
prayed
for
reparation.
now,
the
shipments
in
question
moved
during
the
period
of
january
5
to
may
5,
1948
and
over
the
lines
of
the
respondent
railroads
and
two
canadian
railroads.
it
was
during
this
period
that
the
railroads
had
assessed
at
20%
increase
in
all
their
rates
on
potash.
and
that
increase
was
only
an
emergency
increase
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
commission
later
determined
effective
may
6,
that
the
maximum
increase
on
such
shipments
should
be
20%
but
in
no
case
more
than
$1.60
a
ton.
now,
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
what's
involved.
the
basic
rate
from
carlsbad
to
toronto
was
$12.20
a
ton.
when
that
rate
was
increased
by
the
temporary
increased
of
20%,
it
went
up
to
$14.64.
when
the
commission
decided
what
the
maximum
permit
increase
was
with
$1.60
a
ton
that
rate
on
may
6.
it
came
a
$13.80
a
ton.
our
complaint
before
the
commission
asked
that
we
be
awarded
reparation
for
the
difference
between
the
$14.64
and
the
$13.80.
now,
that
same
proposition
was
pending
in
number
of
cases
before
the
commission
on
potash
and
public
commodities
as
well.
one
of
those
cases
was
consolidated
rendering
versus
the
santa
fe
railroad.
the
commission
decided
that
consolidated
rendering
case
in
1957
and
among
the
destinations
involved
in
that
case,
destination
of
potash
were
car
of
--
i
think
this
is
also
from
loving
and
carlsbad
new
mexico
and
the
destinations
involved
included
detroit
and
port
huron,
michigan.
now
those
two
points
are
border
points
through
which
all
of
our
traffic
moved
in
route
to
canada.
the
commission
held
there
as
we
had
hope
they
would
in
our
case
that
the
shippers
were
entitled
to
reparation
or
the
increase
rates
exceeded
the
basic
rates
plus
$1.60
a
ton
and
they
awarded
reparation.
now,
the
railroads
refused
to
satisfy
our
informal
complaint
and
that
required
us
to
bring
the
form
of
complaint
with
the
commission
in
which
we
made
the
same
allegations
as
we
did
in
the
informal
pleading.
after
hearing,
the
commission
decided
in
our
case
as
it
did
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
and
awarded
us
reparation
for
the
entire
difference
between
the
joint
through
international
rates
which
bore
the
20%
increase
and
what
would
have
been
reasonable
joint
through
international
rates
increased
by
the
$1.60
a
ton.
the
respondents
refused
to
pay
all
of
that
award.
they
paid
us
$5,300.00
but
decline
us
--
decline
to
pay
us
the
remaining
$1,400.00
on
the
ground
that
that
represented
freight
charges
for
transportation
in
canada
and
that
was
beyond
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
quite
frankly
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
quite
frankly
sir,
i
don't
know
how
it
was
arrived
at.
i
think
that's
the
railroad
explanation,
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
now
whether
that
was
on
the
flat
percentage
of
the
total
revenue
or
on
so
much
of
the
rate,
i
don't
know?
mr.
charles
b.
myers
now,
we
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
of
chicago
to
enforce
this
$1,400.00
claim
and
the
district
court
held
in
our
favor
granting
the
full
amount
of
the
award,
gave
us
interest
in
the
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
railroads
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
the
district
court,
we're
here
in
certiorari.
it
is
our
basic
position
in
this
case
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
awarding
for
reparation
and
then
in
doing
it,
all
it
was
doing
was
invoking
the
jurisdiction
that
its
exercise
consistently
in
these
cases
for
the
last
50
years.
the
commission's
decision
in
this
nature
go
back
to
1910,
consistently
holding
that
where
a
shipper
has
paid
an
excessive
joint
through
international
rates
is
entitled
to
full
reparation
for
his
damages.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
it
was
challenged
twice
in
this
court
sir
and
that's
about
what
i'm
going
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
--
going
us
referred
to.
we
say
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
was
challenged
here
in
news
syndicate
versus
new
york
central
case
reported
at
275
u.s.
179
and
subsequently,
in
new
york
decision
in
the
lewis-simas-jones
versus
southern
pacific
company
in
283
u.s.
654.
now
the
respondents
have
no
argument
with
us
that
these
two
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
is
a
shipper
isn't
entitled
to
full
reparation
where
he
is
in
required
to
pay
excessive
joint
through
international
rates.
but
they
say
that
these
cases
are
not
controlling
here
because
the
situation
in
those
cases,
the
record
in
those
cases
did
not
reveal
as
this
record
does
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
from
carlsbad
and
in
loving
to
the
border
trustees
that
is
for
the
american
portion
of
the
free
transportation.
they
argue
that
since
the
commission
had
prescribed
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case,
what
was
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
for
that
american
portion
of
the
whole
that
the
commissions
without
jurisdiction
to
award
anything
more
than
what
it
awarded
to
detroit
in
court
hereon
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case.
we
of
course
take
very
rigorous
exception
to
that.
now,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
and
as
i'll
develop
in
a
moment
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
pay
through
rate.
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
rail
transportation
is
defined
in
section
1
of
the
act.
and
that
section
reproduced
in
the
first
page
of
our
appendix
to
our
brief
and
it
starts
out
with
paragraph
with
the
heading,
carrier
subject
to
regulation.
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
apply
to
common
carriers
engaged
in
the
transportation,
and
skipping
over
a
little
bit
here,
of
properly
wholly
by
railroad
and
then
dropping
down
to
the
third
line
from
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
from
or
to
any
place
in
the
united
states,
to
or
from
a
foreign
country
and
with
this
proviso
but
only
insofar
such
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
an
addition
to
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
railroad
to
amicus
curiae
participations,
one
by
the
united
states
represented
by
the
solicitor
general,
one
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
represented
by
mr.
goodman.
so
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
these
proceeding
that
because
of
the
proviso
limiting
the
transportation
only
insofar
as
it
takes
place
within
the
united
states
is
that
the
commission
has
no
power
over
a
rate
in
a
foreign
country
and
consequently
it
has
no
power
for
reparation
or
other
purposes
to
determine
what
is
a
portion
of
a
joint
--
a
reasonable
portion
of
a
joint
through
international
rate.
they
take
a
similar
position
with
respect
to
a
combination
of
proportional
rates
to
and
from
the
board.
now
that
situation
is
not
involved
in
our
ca
--
in
our
review
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
as
a
consequence,
the
solicitor
general
is
asking
this
court
to
overrule
its
decision
in
news
syndicate
and
in
lewis
and
with
respect
to
the
court
proportional
rates
in
your
decision
in
great
northern
versus
sullivan
294
u.s.
458.
he
would
also
if
he
prevails
reverse
50
years
of
interstate
commerce
commission
precedent.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
commissions
here
and
it's
going
to
participate
in
response
to
the
views
of
the
united
states.
i'll
confine
my
presentation
to
answering
the
respondents
and
dealing
with
the
lower
court's
decision.
there
is
one
very
important
point
which
i
think
we
would
--
should
establish
before
we
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
news
syndicate
and
lewis
cases.
and
that
is
that
the
joint
through
international
rates
which
were
assessed
on
our
shipments
where
the
rates
legally
applicable.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
respondents
over
that.
they
stipulated
that
this
is
so.
and
this
is
important
because
this
court
is
frequently
held
that
there
can
only
be
one
legal
rate
on
a
given
ship.
now
it's
our
position
that
if
once
we
were
assessed,
the
legal
rate
that
is
the
joint
through
international
rate,
there
was
no
other
rate
which
could
have
applied
to
those
--
to
that
transportation.
not
the
rates
from
loving
and
carlsbad
to
detroit
before
hereon.
not
the
rates
to
buffalo
or
to
any
other
gateway
but
only
the
international
rates.
and
we
say
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
case,
the
applicability
of
rates
and
what
we
were
required
to
pay
and
what
our
measure
of
damages
should
be.
now,
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
this
covers
three
transportations.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
no,
i
only
not
--
i
think
both
directions
sir,
because
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
only
from
new
mexico
which
is
a
very
substantial
source
of
potash
as
the
modern
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
that
would
be
arranged
that
way
at
oregon.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
don't
know.
it
wasn't
in
fact
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
other
than
the
fact
that
we
bore
--
paid
and
bore
of
the
charges.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
to
the
canadian
carriers.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
we
take
the
position
as
the
commission
has
for
many
years
that
where
you
have
joint
through
international
rates
under
excessive
that
carriers
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
full
damages
sustained.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
we
could
have
sued
the
canadian
carrier.
yes,
sir.
it's
been
my
experienced
when
we
sued
canadian
carriers
in
the
united
states;
the
first
thing
you
get
is
a
plea
that
they're
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
the
record
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
in
canada,
it's
my
understanding
that
you
have
to
bring
a
--
an
action
in
the
courts
not
before
the
board
of
transport
commissioners.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
i
don't
know
what
effect
it
would
have
in
canada?
i
know
in
this
country,
its
prima
facie
evidence
when
we
you
seek
to
enforce
the
reparation
award.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
you
are
correct,
sir.
they
did
not.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
let's
see
if
i
understand
you.
they
did
not
receive
the
total
transportation
charges.
yes,
that
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
i
don't
know
how
we
would
know
that.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
i'm
not
so
sure
that's
so
sir
because
the
rates
which
we
paid
both
before
and
after
the
proscription
were
relevantly
higher
than
the
rates
to
the
american
destinations
for
the
comparable
distances
as
much
as
$2.16
a
ton
in
some
cases,
so
i'm
not
that
all
sure
that
the
american
carriers
gave
any
portion
to
the
canadian
carriers?
i
really
don't
know.
well
maybe
the
railroads
can
clear
that.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
for
its
division.
whatever
that
may
be.
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
now,
i
was
making
the
point
that
there
can
only
be
one
rate
applicable
on
given
shipment.
and
then
if
you
have
a
joint
rate,
it
removes
the
application
of
any
other
rates.
and
this
is
the
reason
in
which
underlies
with
commission
said
in
this
case
regarding
the
carrier's
liability
with
respect
to
international
traffic.
the
railroads
within
this
country
have
a
clear
alternative
with
respect
to
their
participation
in
international
track.
they
may
publish
rates
to
or
from
the
boundary
and
stand
answerable
only
for
those
rates
or
they
as
they
done
here.
participate
in
joint
through
international
rates
and
beheld
jointly
or
severely
liable
for
any
unlawfulness
in
those
rates.
we
think
that's
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
news
syndicate
and
lewis
cases.
news
syndicate
involved
a
rate
from
a
point
in
canada
to
new
york
city
and
an
action
brought
before
the
commission.
the
commission
held
that
the
rate
was
excessive
and
that
altered
to
the
rise
full
reparation.
carrier
refused
to
pay
and
an
action
was
sought
in
court.
now,
only
the
american
railroads
was
sued
which
is
also
the
situation
here.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
rates
were
paid
in
the
united
state
because
it's
my
recollection
that
the
news
syndicate
--
i
burn
i
speculate
sir.
i
can't
say.
i
don't
think
they
took
the
court's
decision
reveals
that.
now,
in
your
decision
in
news
syndicate,
the
court
said
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
defines
to
and
from
the
international
boundary
and
that
the
carriers
are
required
by
section
1
of
the
act
to
published
joint
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
publish
rates
covering
that
service.
they
hadn't
done
in
the
news
syndicate
case.
and
this
court
decided
that
was
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
which
the
carriers
would
be
liable
under
section
8
for
any
damage
cars
of
the
shipper.
they
also
pointed
out
that
the
failure
to
establish
a
rate
between
the
border
and
american
destination
compel
the
shipper
to
pay
the
joint
through
international
rates.
now,
that's
the
same
situation
which
we
have
here.
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
pay
this
joint
through
rates.
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
since
the
joint
through
rates
were
the
only
rates
before
it,
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
to
inquire
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
those
rates
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
shipper
was
damaged.
and
it
concluded
as
i
have
said
that
it
was
damaged
and
awards
the
reparation.
now,
that
case
was
decided
in
1927,
four
years
later
in
the
lewis
case,
you
restated
and
reaffirmed
what
you
had
said
in
news
syndicate.
the
lewis
case
involved
the
shipment
from
point
in
mexico
to
san
francisco
and
the
commission
had
determined
that
the
rate
was
excessive
and
awarded
reparation.
here
again,
only
the
american
carrier
was
sued.
now,
the
action
was
brought
in
state
courts
as
opposed
in
federal
courts
but
the
railroads
had
also
maintained
that
local
rate
from
the
border
crossing
to
san
francisco.
and
it
was
there
contention
that
having
published
that
rate,
having
it
in
existence
excused
them
from
any
violation
of
section
1.
they
said
that
they
had
complied
with
their
obligation
under
the
act
by
publishing
such
rate.
the
state
court
and
the
appellate
courts
state
agree.
this
court
disagreed
and
said
that
the
news
syndicate
case
was
controlling.
and
in
the
course
of
that
decision,
court
pointed
out
that
the
local
rate
and
the
border
crossing
to
san
francisco
didn't
apply
on
the
transportation
and
that
the
shipper
was
damaged
by
the
joint
through
international
rate
which
the
commission
found
was
excessive.
and
that
the
shipper
was
entitled
to
reparation
here
respective
of
how
the
carriers
divided
their
revenues
in
here
respective
of
any
portion
of
the
revenue
that
was
in
the
foreign
country.
the
underlying
basis
of
the
lewis
case
was
that
the
collection
of
an
excessive
rate
is
a
tort.
and
since
the
rate
was
joint,
the
tort
was
joint
and
the
carriers
were
jointly
and
severally
liable
as
joint
tortfeasors.
this
is
a
position
which
the
commission
has
consistently
followed
and
follows
to
this
day.
now
in
the
two
cases
that
is
news
syndicate
and
lewis
in
our
case,
the
joint
through
international
rates
were
the
only
rates
that
applied
which
means
that
none
other
was
couldn't
been
applied
to
us
and
we
think
that
all
three
cases
are
comfortable.
now,
the
respondents
argue
that
there
obligation
under
the
act
have
been
satisfied
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
prescribed
and
consolidated
rendering
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
from
carlsbad
and
loving
to
these
two
border
points.
we
say
that
that's
immaterial.
the
railroads
didn't
assess
us
on
that
rate.
they
made
us
pay
the
through
rates
and
we
don't
think
our
damages
can
be
measured
in
some
fashion
except
by
that
relation
to
what
would
be
a
reasonable
joint
through
international
rate.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
railroads
and
if
said
that
the
railroad
had
met
their
burden
of
establishing
the
rates
from
the
new
mexico
origins
to
the
border
points.
we
say
that
situation,
that
holding
is
the
same
as
the
state
courts
made
in
the
lewis
case
which
respect
to
the
local
rate
from
the
arizona
border
to
san
francisco.
this
court
held
that
that
rate
had
no
application.
now,
if
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
the
respondents
argue
is
correct
then
we
have
a
situation
where
railroads
operating
within
the
united
states
are
going
to
have
full
freedom
to
establish
any
level
of
international
rates
that
they
want
to.
in
other
words,
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
as
long
as
there
is
an
existence
a
reasonable
rate,
to
or
from
the
boundary.
that
satisfies
the
respondent's
obligation
under
the
act.
we
say
that's
wrong
because
if
that
were
the
case.
the
commission
would
have
no
jurisdiction,
no
control
over
excessive
joint
through
international
rates.
the
shipper
would
have
no
right
to
complaint
as
to
the
through
rate.
it
might
be
two
or
three
times
what
the
rate
should
be
or
it
might
be
destructively
low.
but
as
long
as
it
was
joint
rate
and
the
carrier
had
also
kept
in
effect
a
rate
to
or
from
the
boundary
that
is
between
points
in
united
states.
the
commission
would
be
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
now,
we
don't
think
that
that
was
section
1
of
the
act
means
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
render
this
commission
powerless
in
that
respect.
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous.
i
think
it
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
reinstate.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is,
to
what
extent
does
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
jurisdiction
to
make
an
award
of
reparation
to
a
shipper,
who
has
been
required
to
pay
unreasonably
high
joint
through
international
rates
on
its
traffic
from
points
in
the
united
states
to
points
of
canada?
this
case
had
its
origin
in
an
informal
complaint
which
we
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
1950.
that
complaint
alleged
that
the
international
through
rates
from
carlsbad
and
loving,
new
mexico
to
our
plants
at
toronto
in
welland
and
ontario
province
and
in
--
at
montreal
in
quebec
province,
and
at
saint
john
in
brunswick
were
unreasonable
and
we
prayed
for
reparation.
now,
the
shipments
in
question
moved
during
the
period
of
january
5
to
may
5,
1948
and
over
the
lines
of
the
respondent
railroads
and
two
canadian
railroads.
it
was
during
this
period
that
the
railroads
had
assessed
at
20%
increase
in
all
their
rates
on
potash.
and
that
increase
was
only
an
emergency
increase
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
commission
later
determined
effective
may
6,
that
the
maximum
increase
on
such
shipments
should
be
20%
but
in
no
case
more
than
$1.60
a
ton.
now,
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
what's
involved.
the
basic
rate
from
carlsbad
to
toronto
was
$12.20
a
ton.
when
that
rate
was
increased
by
the
temporary
increased
of
20%,
it
went
up
to
$14.64.
when
the
commission
decided
what
the
maximum
permit
increase
was
with
$1.60
a
ton
that
rate
on
may
6.
it
came
a
$13.80
a
ton.
our
complaint
before
the
commission
asked
that
we
be
awarded
reparation
for
the
difference
between
the
$14.64
and
the
$13.80.
now,
that
same
proposition
was
pending
in
number
of
cases
before
the
commission
on
potash
and
public
commodities
as
well.
one
of
those
cases
was
consolidated
rendering
versus
the
santa
fe
railroad.
the
commission
decided
that
consolidated
rendering
case
in
1957
and
among
the
destinations
involved
in
that
case,
destination
of
potash
were
car
of
--
i
think
this
is
also
from
loving
and
carlsbad
new
mexico
and
the
destinations
involved
included
detroit
and
port
huron,
michigan.
now
those
two
points
are
border
points
through
which
all
of
our
traffic
moved
in
route
to
canada.
the
commission
held
there
as
we
had
hope
they
would
in
our
case
that
the
shippers
were
entitled
to
reparation
or
the
increase
rates
exceeded
the
basic
rates
plus
$1.60
a
ton
and
they
awarded
reparation.
now,
the
railroads
refused
to
satisfy
our
informal
complaint
and
that
required
us
to
bring
the
form
of
complaint
with
the
commission
in
which
we
made
the
same
allegations
as
we
did
in
the
informal
pleading.
after
hearing,
the
commission
decided
in
our
case
as
it
did
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
and
awarded
us
reparation
for
the
entire
difference
between
the
joint
through
international
rates
which
bore
the
20%
increase
and
what
would
have
been
reasonable
joint
through
international
rates
increased
by
the
$1.60
a
ton.
the
respondents
refused
to
pay
all
of
that
award.
they
paid
us
$5,300.00
but
decline
us
--
decline
to
pay
us
the
remaining
$1,400.00
on
the
ground
that
that
represented
freight
charges
for
transportation
in
canada
and
that
was
beyond
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
quite
frankly
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
quite
frankly
sir,
i
don't
know
how
it
was
arrived
at.
i
think
that's
the
railroad
explanation,
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
now
whether
that
was
on
the
flat
percentage
of
the
total
revenue
or
on
so
much
of
the
rate,
i
don't
know?
mr.
charles
b.
myers
now,
we
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
of
chicago
to
enforce
this
$1,400.00
claim
and
the
district
court
held
in
our
favor
granting
the
full
amount
of
the
award,
gave
us
interest
in
the
reasonable
attorney's
fee
as
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
railroads
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
the
district
court,
we're
here
in
certiorari.
it
is
our
basic
position
in
this
case
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
awarding
for
reparation
and
then
in
doing
it,
all
it
was
doing
was
invoking
the
jurisdiction
that
its
exercise
consistently
in
these
cases
for
the
last
50
years.
the
commission's
decision
in
this
nature
go
back
to
1910,
consistently
holding
that
where
a
shipper
has
paid
an
excessive
joint
through
international
rates
is
entitled
to
full
reparation
for
his
damages.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
it
was
challenged
twice
in
this
court
sir
and
that's
about
what
i'm
going
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
--
going
us
referred
to.
we
say
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
was
challenged
here
in
news
syndicate
versus
new
york
central
case
reported
at
275
u.s.
179
and
subsequently,
in
new
york
decision
in
the
lewis-simas-jones
versus
southern
pacific
company
in
283
u.s.
654.
now
the
respondents
have
no
argument
with
us
that
these
two
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
is
a
shipper
isn't
entitled
to
full
reparation
where
he
is
in
required
to
pay
excessive
joint
through
international
rates.
but
they
say
that
these
cases
are
not
controlling
here
because
the
situation
in
those
cases,
the
record
in
those
cases
did
not
reveal
as
this
record
does
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
from
carlsbad
and
in
loving
to
the
border
trustees
that
is
for
the
american
portion
of
the
free
transportation.
they
argue
that
since
the
commission
had
prescribed
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case,
what
was
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
for
that
american
portion
of
the
whole
that
the
commissions
without
jurisdiction
to
award
anything
more
than
what
it
awarded
to
detroit
in
court
hereon
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case.
we
of
course
take
very
rigorous
exception
to
that.
now,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
and
as
i'll
develop
in
a
moment
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
pay
through
rate.
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
rail
transportation
is
defined
in
section
1
of
the
act.
and
that
section
reproduced
in
the
first
page
of
our
appendix
to
our
brief
and
it
starts
out
with
paragraph
with
the
heading,
carrier
subject
to
regulation.
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
apply
to
common
carriers
engaged
in
the
transportation,
and
skipping
over
a
little
bit
here,
of
properly
wholly
by
railroad
and
then
dropping
down
to
the
third
line
from
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
from
or
to
any
place
in
the
united
states,
to
or
from
a
foreign
country
and
with
this
proviso
but
only
insofar
such
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
an
addition
to
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
railroad
to
amicus
curiae
participations,
one
by
the
united
states
represented
by
the
solicitor
general,
one
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
represented
by
mr.
goodman.
so
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
these
proceeding
that
because
of
the
proviso
limiting
the
transportation
only
insofar
as
it
takes
place
within
the
united
states
is
that
the
commission
has
no
power
over
a
rate
in
a
foreign
country
and
consequently
it
has
no
power
for
reparation
or
other
purposes
to
determine
what
is
a
portion
of
a
joint
--
a
reasonable
portion
of
a
joint
through
international
rate.
they
take
a
similar
position
with
respect
to
a
combination
of
proportional
rates
to
and
from
the
board.
now
that
situation
is
not
involved
in
our
ca
--
in
our
review
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
as
a
consequence,
the
solicitor
general
is
asking
this
court
to
overrule
its
decision
in
news
syndicate
and
in
lewis
and
with
respect
to
the
court
proportional
rates
in
your
decision
in
great
northern
versus
sullivan
294
u.s.
458.
he
would
also
if
he
prevails
reverse
50
years
of
interstate
commerce
commission
precedent.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
commissions
here
and
it's
going
to
participate
in
response
to
the
views
of
the
united
states.
i'll
confine
my
presentation
to
answering
the
respondents
and
dealing
with
the
lower
court's
decision.
there
is
one
very
important
point
which
i
think
we
would
--
should
establish
before
we
get
into
a
discussion
of
the
news
syndicate
and
lewis
cases.
and
that
is
that
the
joint
through
international
rates
which
were
assessed
on
our
shipments
where
the
rates
legally
applicable.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
respondents
over
that.
they
stipulated
that
this
is
so.
and
this
is
important
because
this
court
is
frequently
held
that
there
can
only
be
one
legal
rate
on
a
given
ship.
now
it's
our
position
that
if
once
we
were
assessed,
the
legal
rate
that
is
the
joint
through
international
rate,
there
was
no
other
rate
which
could
have
applied
to
those
--
to
that
transportation.
not
the
rates
from
loving
and
carlsbad
to
detroit
before
hereon.
not
the
rates
to
buffalo
or
to
any
other
gateway
but
only
the
international
rates.
and
we
say
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
case,
the
applicability
of
rates
and
what
we
were
required
to
pay
and
what
our
measure
of
damages
should
be.
now,
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
this
covers
three
transportations.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
no,
i
only
not
--
i
think
both
directions
sir,
because
the
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
only
from
new
mexico
which
is
a
very
substantial
source
of
potash
as
the
modern
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
that
would
be
arranged
that
way
at
oregon.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
don't
know.
it
wasn't
in
fact
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
other
than
the
fact
that
we
bore
--
paid
and
bore
of
the
charges.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
to
the
canadian
carriers.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
we
take
the
position
as
the
commission
has
for
many
years
that
where
you
have
joint
through
international
rates
under
excessive
that
carriers
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
full
damages
sustained.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
we
could
have
sued
the
canadian
carrier.
yes,
sir.
it's
been
my
experienced
when
we
sued
canadian
carriers
in
the
united
states;
the
first
thing
you
get
is
a
plea
that
they're
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
the
record
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well
--
mr.
charles
b.
myers
in
canada,
it's
my
understanding
that
you
have
to
bring
a
--
an
action
in
the
courts
not
before
the
board
of
transport
commissioners.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
i
don't
know
what
effect
it
would
have
in
canada?
i
know
in
this
country,
its
prima
facie
evidence
when
we
you
seek
to
enforce
the
reparation
award.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
you
are
correct,
sir.
they
did
not.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
let's
see
if
i
understand
you.
they
did
not
receive
the
total
transportation
charges.
yes,
that
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
i
don't
know
how
we
would
know
that.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
i'm
not
so
sure
that's
so
sir
because
the
rates
which
we
paid
both
before
and
after
the
proscription
were
relevantly
higher
than
the
rates
to
the
american
destinations
for
the
comparable
distances
as
much
as
$2.16
a
ton
in
some
cases,
so
i'm
not
that
all
sure
that
the
american
carriers
gave
any
portion
to
the
canadian
carriers?
i
really
don't
know.
well
maybe
the
railroads
can
clear
that.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
for
its
division.
whatever
that
may
be.
yes.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
yes.
now,
i
was
making
the
point
that
there
can
only
be
one
rate
applicable
on
given
shipment.
and
then
if
you
have
a
joint
rate,
it
removes
the
application
of
any
other
rates.
and
this
is
the
reason
in
which
underlies
with
commission
said
in
this
case
regarding
the
carrier's
liability
with
respect
to
international
traffic.
the
railroads
within
this
country
have
a
clear
alternative
with
respect
to
their
participation
in
international
track.
they
may
publish
rates
to
or
from
the
boundary
and
stand
answerable
only
for
those
rates
or
they
as
they
done
here.
participate
in
joint
through
international
rates
and
beheld
jointly
or
severely
liable
for
any
unlawfulness
in
those
rates.
we
think
that's
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
news
syndicate
and
lewis
cases.
news
syndicate
involved
a
rate
from
a
point
in
canada
to
new
york
city
and
an
action
brought
before
the
commission.
the
commission
held
that
the
rate
was
excessive
and
that
altered
to
the
rise
full
reparation.
carrier
refused
to
pay
and
an
action
was
sought
in
court.
now,
only
the
american
railroads
was
sued
which
is
also
the
situation
here.
mr.
charles
b.
myers
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
rates
were
paid
in
the
united
state
because
it's
my
recollection
that
the
news
syndicate
--
i
burn
i
speculate
sir.
i
can't
say.
i
don't
think
they
took
the
court's
decision
reveals
that.
now,
in
your
decision
in
news
syndicate,
the
court
said
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
defines
to
and
from
the
international
boundary
and
that
the
carriers
are
required
by
section
1
of
the
act
to
published
joint
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
publish
rates
covering
that
service.
they
hadn't
done
in
the
news
syndicate
case.
and
this
court
decided
that
was
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
which
the
carriers
would
be
liable
under
section
8
for
any
damage
cars
of
the
shipper.
they
also
pointed
out
that
the
failure
to
establish
a
rate
between
the
border
and
american
destination
compel
the
shipper
to
pay
the
joint
through
international
rates.
now,
that's
the
same
situation
which
we
have
here.
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
pay
this
joint
through
rates.
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
since
the
joint
through
rates
were
the
only
rates
before
it,
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
to
inquire
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
those
rates
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
shipper
was
damaged.
and
it
concluded
as
i
have
said
that
it
was
damaged
and
awards
the
reparation.
now,
that
case
was
decided
in
1927,
four
years
later
in
the
lewis
case,
you
restated
and
reaffirmed
what
you
had
said
in
news
syndicate.
the
lewis
case
involved
the
shipment
from
point
in
mexico
to
san
francisco
and
the
commission
had
determined
that
the
rate
was
excessive
and
awarded
reparation.
here
again,
only
the
american
carrier
was
sued.
now,
the
action
was
brought
in
state
courts
as
opposed
in
federal
courts
but
the
railroads
had
also
maintained
that
local
rate
from
the
border
crossing
to
san
francisco.
and
it
was
there
contention
that
having
published
that
rate,
having
it
in
existence
excused
them
from
any
violation
of
section
1.
they
said
that
they
had
complied
with
their
obligation
under
the
act
by
publishing
such
rate.
the
state
court
and
the
appellate
courts
state
agree.
this
court
disagreed
and
said
that
the
news
syndicate
case
was
controlling.
and
in
the
course
of
that
decision,
court
pointed
out
that
the
local
rate
and
the
border
crossing
to
san
francisco
didn't
apply
on
the
transportation
and
that
the
shipper
was
damaged
by
the
joint
through
international
rate
which
the
commission
found
was
excessive.
and
that
the
shipper
was
entitled
to
reparation
here
respective
of
how
the
carriers
divided
their
revenues
in
here
respective
of
any
portion
of
the
revenue
that
was
in
the
foreign
country.
the
underlying
basis
of
the
lewis
case
was
that
the
collection
of
an
excessive
rate
is
a
tort.
and
since
the
rate
was
joint,
the
tort
was
joint
and
the
carriers
were
jointly
and
severally
liable
as
joint
tortfeasors.
this
is
a
position
which
the
commission
has
consistently
followed
and
follows
to
this
day.
now
in
the
two
cases
that
is
news
syndicate
and
lewis
in
our
case,
the
joint
through
international
rates
were
the
only
rates
that
applied
which
means
that
none
other
was
couldn't
been
applied
to
us
and
we
think
that
all
three
cases
are
comfortable.
now,
the
respondents
argue
that
there
obligation
under
the
act
have
been
satisfied
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
prescribed
and
consolidated
rendering
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
from
carlsbad
and
loving
to
these
two
border
points.
we
say
that
that's
immaterial.
the
railroads
didn't
assess
us
on
that
rate.
they
made
us
pay
the
through
rates
and
we
don't
think
our
damages
can
be
measured
in
some
fashion
except
by
that
relation
to
what
would
be
a
reasonable
joint
through
international
rate.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
railroads
and
if
said
that
the
railroad
had
met
their
burden
of
establishing
the
rates
from
the
new
mexico
origins
to
the
border
points.
we
say
that
situation,
that
holding
is
the
same
as
the
state
courts
made
in
the
lewis
case
which
respect
to
the
local
rate
from
the
arizona
border
to
san
francisco.
this
court
held
that
that
rate
had
no
application.
now,
if
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
the
respondents
argue
is
correct
then
we
have
a
situation
where
railroads
operating
within
the
united
states
are
going
to
have
full
freedom
to
establish
any
level
of
international
rates
that
they
want
to.
in
other
words,
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
as
long
as
there
is
an
existence
a
reasonable
rate,
to
or
from
the
boundary.
that
satisfies
the
respondent's
obligation
under
the
act.
we
say
that's
wrong
because
if
that
were
the
case.
the
commission
would
have
no
jurisdiction,
no
control
over
excessive
joint
through
international
rates.
the
shipper
would
have
no
right
to
complaint
as
to
the
through
rate.
it
might
be
two
or
three
times
what
the
rate
should
be
or
it
might
be
destructively
low.
but
as
long
as
it
was
joint
rate
and
the
carrier
had
also
kept
in
effect
a
rate
to
or
from
the
boundary
that
is
between
points
in
united
states.
the
commission
would
be
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
now,
we
don't
think
that
that
was
section
1
of
the
act
means
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
render
this
commission
powerless
in
that
respect.
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous.
i
think
it
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
reinstate.
