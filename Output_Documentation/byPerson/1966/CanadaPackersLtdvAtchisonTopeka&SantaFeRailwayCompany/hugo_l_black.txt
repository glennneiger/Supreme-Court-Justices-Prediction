with
the
respect
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
going
to
submit
a
question
to
congress
try
to
settle
this
thing
so
it
would
have
sense
in,
what
would
you
recommend?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
you
can
read
that
for
example.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
serve
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
occurs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it
--
the
best
i
can
gather
with
all
these
confused
arguments
that's
made
in
this
case,
confused
because
of
my
ignorance
about
it.
it
is
that
united
states
can
regulate
its
commerce
here
and
that
can't
regulate
it
in
canada.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
regulate
that
here
and
not
try
to
regulate
that,
it's
a
broad
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
how
can
that
be
done,
that
seems
to
be
the
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
couldn't
be
too
high,
could
it
because
any
rate
in
canada
is
just
unreasonable
as
fix
by
canadian
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you
are
arguing
that
we
should
force
the
commission
to
follow
canadian
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
all
the
problem
we
have?
you
got
a
rate
that's
just
and
reasonable
in
canada
because
it's
canadian
rate.
and
the
problem
seems
to
be
to
get
this
country
either
through
the
commission
of
something
else
to
attach
the
legal
american
rate
to
the
legal
canadian
rate
which
is
whatever
rate
they
have
in
canada.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
that's
a
--
the
reason
i'm
asking,
it
seems
to
me
like
that
but
you're
asking.
but
what
does
it
take
to
get
that
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
can
be
a
tort
in
canada
if
it's
a
legal
canadian
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
however
sample
it
may
be,
we
then
have
basing
just
as
the
chief
justice
said,
according
to
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
you
find
it
with
reference
to
the
canadian
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
commission
of
course
couldn't
change
the
canadian
law
by
what's
the
fair
rate
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
effect,
it
found
that
the
total
pro
rate
was
unfair
because
it
found
that
the
part
of
the
rate
going
to
canada
was
unfair,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
--
what
matters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
the
best
way
to
handle
it.
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
part
of
it
it's
in
canada
and
part
of
it
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
one
that's
in
canada
is
governed
by
canadian
law,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
governed
by
canadian
law
and
insofar
as
the
rate
they
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
it
governed
in
determining
the
legal
rate
in
america.
each
country
has
a
right
to
consider
whether
to
let
some
law
charge
by
canada
be
charge
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
you're
saying
is
an
order
to
do
business
in
this
country,
it's
best
to
agree
to
do
business
on
its
central
plans
and
programs
and
rules?

i'm

questioning
