mr.
harvey
huston
the
respondents
sir
--
mr.
harvey
huston
we're
going
to
go
next
on
with
the
agreed
upon
or
--
mr.
harvey
huston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
representing
the
nine
american
railroads
which
participated
in
this
through
international
shipments.
and
in
order
to
put
our
decision
into
proper
perspective,
i
want
to
discuss
first
precisely
in
dollars
and
cents
fashion
what
the
commission
has
done
here.
mr.
myers
has
discussed
the
decision
in
the
commission
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
in
which
rates
of
potash
were
found
unreasonable
and
reparation
of
origin.
the
theory
the
commission
and
the
consolidated
rendering
case
was
that
a
temporary
authorized
rate
increase
of
20%
was
excessive
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeded
a
subsequently
authorized
maximum
increase
of
a
$1.60
a
ton,
to
give
an
example
the
exactly
how
that
works.
the
rate
charge
during
this
period
the
first
five
months
of
1948
on
potash
from
carlsbad
to
detroit,
michigan,
excuse
me,
the
basic
rate
before
the
increases
are
applied
is
$11.10.
during
these
five
months
period,
the
20%
temporary
increase
supplied
to
that
that
came
to
$2.22.
then
when
the
commission
decided
that
they
would
throw
out
all
of
these
temporary
increases
above
the
$1.60
a
ton.
that
meant
that
the
rate
to
detroit
was
excessive
by
the
difference
of
$0.62
a
ton
and
so,
the
commissioner
awarded
reparation
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
on
the
detroit
shipments
in
the
amount
of
$.062
a
ton.
now
when
we
come
to
the
canada
packers
case,
that
case
had
been
held
and
obeyed
inspite
the
commission
pending
the
outcome
of
a
consolidated
rendering
case.
and
the
canada
packers
case
was
based
upon
the
consolidated
rendering
case
and
precisely
the
same
formula
was
applied
to
determine
unreasonableness.
in
order
words,
the
difference
between
the
20%
increase
and
a
final
maximum
increase
with
the
$1.60
a
ton.
for
example,
to
toronto,
this
meant
that
the
basic
rate
which
has
been
increased
from
$12.20
by
20%
rose
to
14.64
during
the
period
these
shipments
moved.
any
shipments
move
during
the
precise
period
of
time
as
the
shipment
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case.
from
this
now,
let's
open
the
origin
as
the
same
commodity.
and
all
of
these
shipments
went
through
detroit
for
herein.
i
used
detroit
as
an
example
because
the
same
rate
applied
through
both
of
the
border
crossing.
so
when
the
commission
applied
this
formula
to
this
canadian
shipments
because
the
formula
has
a,
you
might
say
a
built
bias
against
the
higher
rated
shipments
for
the
longer
distances,
you
come
up
with
the
finding
that
the
rates
in
toronto
were
excessive
by
$0.84
a
ton
whereas
the
rates
to
detroit
were
excessive
by
$.062
a
ton.
the
only
difference
between
the
shipments
to
detroit
and
a
shipment
to
toronto
was
an
additional
transportation
it
was
performed
entirely
within
canada.
it's
even
more
interesting
to
see
what
the
commission
did
by
applying
this
arbitrarily
on
a
shipment
that
went
from
carlsbad
through
detroit
to
toronto
beyond
montreal.
thereby
applying
the
same
formula,
you
come
up
with
an
excess
of
a
$1.28
a
ton.
more
than
twice
the
measure
of
unreasonableness
of
the
detroit
rates.
we
go
all
the
way
to
saint
john
to
brunswick.
you
come
up
with
an
excess
of
a
$1.80
per
ton.
i
should
mention
the
saint
john
situation
is
under
little
unusual
because
this
shipments
reentered
united
states
for
a
short
distance
across
northern
portion
of
the
state
of
maine
because
the
aiding
pacific
take
a
shortcut
across
there.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
wanted
to
know
exactly
what
the
railroads
did
in
complying
with
the
reparation
or
what
was
entered
here.
the
order
itself
here's
on
pages
19
and
21
of
the
record
that
contains
in
it
some
qualifying
language
in
two
places
that
it
applies
only
insofar
as
the
transportation
took
place
within
united
states.
so
when
the
claim
for
this
reparation
totaling
over
$6,600.00
of
total
transportation
charges
of
some
what
over
$100,000.00.
there
are
131
shipments
involved.
when
that
claim
for
the
$6,600.00
was
presented
to
the
auditor
of
the
freight
accounts
of
one
of
the
american
railroads,
which
was
the
origin
carrier
with
the
claim
for
payment.
he
computed
--
recomputed
the
award
by
deducting
a
division
representing
the
share
of
the
canadian
railroads
for
each
of
this
particular
shipments.
now
those
division
vary
--
divisions
vary
the
percentages
depending
upon
what
the
destination
in
canada
is
and
they
even
vary
depending
upon
which
particular
railroads
in
the
united
states
participated
in
the
movement.
but
on
a
weighted
average
basis,
the
division
of
the
canadian
railroads
comes
to
slightly
less
from
21%
and
that
is
how
we
computed
the
figure
of
$1,390.00
for
which
the
--
this
suit
was
brought.
now
when
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well
the
total
--
the
total
award
was
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
that
was
computed
split.
we
did
that
strictly
on
a
divisional
basis.
mr.
harvey
huston
that's
right.
mr.
harvey
huston
the
--
in
other
words,
the
revenue
was
divided
21%
to
the
canadian
railroad,
79%
to
the
american.
therefore
the
reparation
award
was
divided
in
the
same
manner.
so
the
american
railroads
paid
out
79%
and
said
that's
all
we're
going
to
pay.
now
when
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
federal
courts,
we
defended
on
two
grounds.
the
first
ground
was
the
fact
that
the
language
in
the
reparation
order
specifically
carried
these
restrictions
where
the
limitations
to
apply
of
transportation
performed
within
the
united
states
and
we
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
order
was
it
best
ambiguous.
if
you
can
look
at
the
dollar
amounts
in
the
reparation
order,
you
can
see
that
the
commission
applied
the
same
formula
as
it
had
done
on
domestic
shipments
that
saw
the
(inaudible)
case.
but
we
took
the
position
that
the
order
was
ambiguous
and
that
even
on
the
old
terms
of
the
commission's
order.
we
had
it
right
to
make
this
deduction.
that
point
was
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
it
was
not
specifically
resolved
one
way
or
another.
so
our
alternative
defense
those
that
assuming
the
dollar
amounts
in
the
commission's
award
take
precedents
over
this
limiting
language.
in
other
words,
ignore
the
limiting
language.
then
you
come
up
quite
frankly
against
the
lewis
case
which
--
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
so
heavily.
the
lewis
case
is
an
extension
of
the
news
syndicate
case
and
they
held
there
that
even
if
there
was
shown
the
existence
of
a
domestic
rate
covering
the
domestic
portion
of
a
few
transportation.
that
alone
was
not
enough
to
bring
it
out
from
underneath
the
rule
of
the
lewis
case
so
as
to
restrict
the
payment
of
repara
--
the
award
of
reparation
to
something
other
then
representing
the
complete
transportation
--
complete
international
transportation.
now
the
lewis
case,
the
court
hold
attention
to
that
that
when
a
defendant
filed
his
answer.
he
referred
to
this
domestic
rather
this
the
railroad,
referred
to
this
domestic
rate.
but
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
they
did
not
specifically
claim
that
it
was
maximum
reasonable
rate
and
three
or
four
other
chimes
in
this
opinion,
the
court
comments
on
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
maximum
reasonable
rate.
it's
our
position
that
the
lewis
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
merely
proving
that
aim
great
exist
between
the
two
united
states
portions
of
the
two
transportation
does
not
permit
a
reduction
in
the
reparation
award
so
as
to
exclude
any
extra
territorial
effect.
now,
we
think
the
significant
portion
of
this
decision
in
the
lewis
case
is
the
emphasis
upon
a
maximum
reasonable
rate.
and
here,
we
have
demonstrated
that
a
maximum
reasonable
standard.
we
don't
say
that
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
here
from
detroit
to
carlsbad
to
detroit
applied
to
these
shipments.
we
say
that
the
commission
itself
has
established
a
standard
or
shipment
of
potash
from
carlsbad
to
detroit
and
the
establishment
of
that
standard
by
commission
is
the
best
possible
proof
of
what
a
maximum
reasonable
proportion
would
be
of
the
through
international
rate.
mr.
harvey
huston
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
is
our
position
that
if
the
commission
in
other
words
had
set
up
a
maximum
reasonable
standard.
here
it
was
contemporaneous
the
same
period
january
5
through
may
5,
1948
--
mr.
harvey
huston
the
commission
has
twice
done
that.
the
commission
in
the
black
horse
tobacco
case
and
the
citizens
gas
utility
case,
a
recent
case
both
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
commission
in
effect
threw
up
his
hand,
they
said,
“this
is
undivided
whole
and
you
can't
chop
up
in
two
and
it
is
too
much
for
us.”
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
i
don't
think
there's
specific
holding.
i
--
i
think
the
lewis
case
should
be
interpreted
as
certainly
implying
that
the
result
might
be
different
if
they
had
evidence
of
a
maximum
reasonable
standard.
mr.
harvey
huston
in
principle?
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
i
think
it's
certainly
it
forces
the
commission
to
sta
--
to
recognize
the
same
standard
for
all
comparable
shipments.
in
other
words,
the
transportation
through
the
united
states
is
just
the
same.
and
i
think
the
arizona
grocery
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1932
is
very
pertinent
here.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
when
the
commission
had
once
established
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
between
two
points.
they
couldn't
go
back
later
and
say,
“well,
we
think
that
that
decision
was
wrong
and
someone
charging
was
charged
at
maximum
reasonable
rate
can
go
back
and
get
some
additional
reparation.”
now,
we
think
by
analogy
that
the
same
principle
applies
here
because
you
got
the
only
difference
between
the
shipments
from
carlsbad
to
detroit
were
this
maximum
reasonable
rate
was
established
is
some
additional
transportation
beyond
detroit
into
canada.
that's
the
only
difference
that
you
have
from
the
shipments
determining
at
carlsbad
--
at
detroit
at
the
border.
mr.
harvey
huston
i'm
very
much
afraid
that's
true.
the
commission
itself
voluntarily
on
a
few
occasions
has
done
somewhat
the
other
way,
the
carlowitz
case,
the
international
paper
case
both
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
there
the
commission
looked
only
if
the
reasonableness
of
the
american
factor
of
the
international
joint
rate
and
ruled
upon
that.
but
the
great
majority
of
instances,
they
form
the
other
way
and
refused
to
--
mr.
harvey
huston
i
would
certainly
think
that
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well
as
a
practical
matter,
of
course
here
it's
a
little
difficult
to
answer
your
question
because
here
the
commission
did
it
for
us.
mr.
harvey
huston
and
if
may
be
that
the
commission
could
take
the
positions
that,
well
in
the
future,
if
the
railroads
want
to
avoid
and
reparation
award
this
sort.
then
they
got
to
bring
in
some
sort
of
evidence
to
help
us
determine
what
would
be
the
maximum
reasonable
proportion.
mr.
harvey
huston
very
much
--
mr.
harvey
huston
i
don't
know
that
it
would
add
very
much.
certainly,
i
would
think
they
would
have
every
bit
of
cooperation
from
the
railroads
involve
that,
in
other
words,
it
means
a
financial
saving
to
them.
now,
the
commission
and
the
petitioner
are
both
called
attentions
in
their
briefs
to
the
proposal
made
by
the
solicitor
general
on
which
i'll
touch
in
just
minute
that
this
would
mean
that
railroads
would
have
to
bring
in
evidence
of
divisions
to
and
from
the
border
crossings
and
they
might
be
reluctant
to
do
that.
well,
i'm
sure
there
would
no
reluctance
where
it
would
be
a
financial
advantage
to
american
railroads
to
do
that.
mr.
harvey
huston
yes,
they
made
a
specific
finding
to
each
of
these
canadian
destinations
--
mr.
harvey
huston
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
our
theory
is
that
this
sets
up
a
standard
beyond
which
the
commission
cannot
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
standard
applied
in
the
international
through
rate
was
the
identical
standards
that
they
applied
on
a
domestic
rate
to
detroit.
in
other
words,
the
difference
between
this
20%
interim
freight
rate
increase
at
a
maximum
of
$1.60
per
ton.
they
use
precisely
the
same
theory
and
the
same
formula.
and
so
you
get
to
these
results
that
i
have
called
attention
to
that
by
applying
the
same
formula.
they
would
require
a
refund
of
$0.62
per
ton
if
the
shipment
only
goes
to
detroit;
if
it
goes
beyond
the
toronto,
it
goes
up
to
$0.84;
if
beyond
that
to
montreal
its
$1.28;
saint
john
to
brunswick
it's
a
$1.80.
all
these
directed
traceable
to
additional
transportation
in
canada.
mr.
harvey
huston
oh,
i
think
certainly
if
the
commission
is
using
the
same
line
of
reasoning
in
both
examples.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
say
that
this
one
kind
of
a
thing
applies
which
is
a
domestic
shipment.
but
my
golly,
if
you're
going
to
go
on
beyond
in
the
canada,
we're
going
to
take
more
out
of
your
height.
this
is
the
whole
--
this
is
really
what's
--
what
are
annoyance
here
is?
mr.
harvey
huston
we're
asking
the
commission
to
follow
a
fix
--
a
consistent
standard.
i
think
i
also
should
mention
here
that
the
--
now
the
theory
of
the
court
below
in
the
canada
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
there
interpretation
of
precisely
how
this
reparation
should
be
paid
out
is
slightly
different
than
what
we
did
in
withholding
this
$1,390.00
out
of
divisional
basis.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
would
mean
simply
that
you
take
the
$0.62
a
ton
held
to
be
the
unreasonable
measure
on
shipments
going
to
starts
the
border
and
applied
to
have
--
to
the
total
tonnage
involved
here.
and
in
that
respect
you
come
out
with
the
total
reparation
figure.
that
however
is
not
a
matter
of
record
here
because
the
divisions
and
the
weights
of
the
various
shipments
are
not
a
part
of
the
record.
now
the
solicitor
general
has
a
third
method
of
calculating
damages
in
the
case
of
this
sort.
the
solicitor
general's
theory
that
if
the
commission
make
a
finding
of
max
of
--
a
finding
that
an
international
joint
rate
is
unreasonable.
before
awarding
reparation
they
must
make
a
subsidiary
finding
of
what
a
just
and
reasonable
proportion
of
that
should
be
for
the
domestic
portion
of
it.
so
in
other
words,
taking
the
example
of
a
shipment
to
toronto
for
instance,
the
commission
should
decide
that
what
would
be
on
a
true
shipment
to
toronto.
what
would
be
the
maximum
reasonable
proportion
up
to
the
detroit?
and
when
they
make
that
kind
of
determination
then,
they
compare
that
with
the
division
received
by
the
american
railroads
on
the
two
shipments
to
toronto.
and
if
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
to
detroit
is
less
than
the
division
actually
received
by
the
american
railroads,
that
division
must
be
turnover
to
or
in
this
case
it
would
be
canada
packers.
we
have
no
objection
in
theory
to
what
the
solicitor
general
suggests.
we
think
it's
a
good
practical
solution
which
should
be
fair
to
parties
in
these
cases.
in
this
particular
case,
we
contend
and
here
is
where
we
have
our
differences.
we
contend
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
this
a
specific
finding
because
the
commission
has
already
done
it
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case.
and
we
think
it
could
be
usual
thing
to
go
back
nearly
19
years
later
and
say,
“please
determine,
what
is
a
maximum
reasonable
proportion
from
carlsbad
to
detroit
on
this
1948
shipment.”
mr.
harvey
huston
oh!
not
necessarily.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
could
be
very
well
be
the
other
way.
mr.
harvey
huston
yes.
mr.
harvey
huston
it's
already
been
done.
now
this
--
mr.
harvey
huston
certainly.
mr.
harvey
huston
the
--
oh,
that's,
well
i
can
answer
that
question.
i
have
that
information
works
out.
in
other
words,
you
assume
that
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
to
detroit
would
be
found
to
be
of
proper
proportion.
mr.
harvey
huston
alright.
now
that
comes
to
$12.70
per
ton.
i
have
had
the
auditor
freight
accounts
of
one
of
the
railroads
here
make
a
determination
of
that
question
and
that
rate
produces
a
total
sum
of
something
over
$87,000.00.
now,
the
divisions
receive
by
the
united
states
carriers
on
these
shipments
come
to
something
over
$85,000.00.
so
on
that
theory,
the
canada
packers
should
not
have
any
reparation
at
all.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
also
that
possibly
the
--
that
maximum
reasonable
rate
to
detroit
might
not
be
appropriate
as
a
proportion
because
of
the
fact
that
presumably
the
rate
to
detroit
included
a
factor
for
the
terminal
services
involved
at
detroit
and
that
might
not
be
appropriate
for
a
shipment
going
beyond
detroit
determinating
at
toronto.
i
think
this
is
not
a
matter
of
great
moment.
the
commission
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
in
discussing
this
potash
traffic
from
carlsbad
made
a
specific
comment
that
terminal
operations
on
this
traffic
are
relatively
simply.
so
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
a
serious
objection
that
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
think
the
enforcement
of
the
or
rather
i
think
the
restrictions
upon
the
commission's
reparation
of
award
would
then
determine
to
the
appropriate
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
have
a
great
deal
of
merit
because
if
you
don't
agree
with
that
conclusion,
in
effect
you're
telling
the
commission
that,
it's
alright
to
the
domestic
portion
to
find
that
rates
where
excessive
by
$0.62
a
ton,
if
you're
only
going
to
detroit
but
by
$0.84
a
ton,
a$1.28
a
ton
or
$1.80
a
ton
depending
on
how
far
you
go
into
canada.
i
don't
think
that
type
of
award
is
within
the
confines
of
the
jurisdictional
limitations
of
section
1
of
the
act.
and
we're
asking
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
huston
the
respondents
sir
--
mr.
harvey
huston
we're
going
to
go
next
on
with
the
agreed
upon
or
--
mr.
harvey
huston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
representing
the
nine
american
railroads
which
participated
in
this
through
international
shipments.
and
in
order
to
put
our
decision
into
proper
perspective,
i
want
to
discuss
first
precisely
in
dollars
and
cents
fashion
what
the
commission
has
done
here.
mr.
myers
has
discussed
the
decision
in
the
commission
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
in
which
rates
of
potash
were
found
unreasonable
and
reparation
of
origin.
the
theory
the
commission
and
the
consolidated
rendering
case
was
that
a
temporary
authorized
rate
increase
of
20%
was
excessive
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeded
a
subsequently
authorized
maximum
increase
of
a
$1.60
a
ton,
to
give
an
example
the
exactly
how
that
works.
the
rate
charge
during
this
period
the
first
five
months
of
1948
on
potash
from
carlsbad
to
detroit,
michigan,
excuse
me,
the
basic
rate
before
the
increases
are
applied
is
$11.10.
during
these
five
months
period,
the
20%
temporary
increase
supplied
to
that
that
came
to
$2.22.
then
when
the
commission
decided
that
they
would
throw
out
all
of
these
temporary
increases
above
the
$1.60
a
ton.
that
meant
that
the
rate
to
detroit
was
excessive
by
the
difference
of
$0.62
a
ton
and
so,
the
commissioner
awarded
reparation
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
on
the
detroit
shipments
in
the
amount
of
$.062
a
ton.
now
when
we
come
to
the
canada
packers
case,
that
case
had
been
held
and
obeyed
inspite
the
commission
pending
the
outcome
of
a
consolidated
rendering
case.
and
the
canada
packers
case
was
based
upon
the
consolidated
rendering
case
and
precisely
the
same
formula
was
applied
to
determine
unreasonableness.
in
order
words,
the
difference
between
the
20%
increase
and
a
final
maximum
increase
with
the
$1.60
a
ton.
for
example,
to
toronto,
this
meant
that
the
basic
rate
which
has
been
increased
from
$12.20
by
20%
rose
to
14.64
during
the
period
these
shipments
moved.
any
shipments
move
during
the
precise
period
of
time
as
the
shipment
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case.
from
this
now,
let's
open
the
origin
as
the
same
commodity.
and
all
of
these
shipments
went
through
detroit
for
herein.
i
used
detroit
as
an
example
because
the
same
rate
applied
through
both
of
the
border
crossing.
so
when
the
commission
applied
this
formula
to
this
canadian
shipments
because
the
formula
has
a,
you
might
say
a
built
bias
against
the
higher
rated
shipments
for
the
longer
distances,
you
come
up
with
the
finding
that
the
rates
in
toronto
were
excessive
by
$0.84
a
ton
whereas
the
rates
to
detroit
were
excessive
by
$.062
a
ton.
the
only
difference
between
the
shipments
to
detroit
and
a
shipment
to
toronto
was
an
additional
transportation
it
was
performed
entirely
within
canada.
it's
even
more
interesting
to
see
what
the
commission
did
by
applying
this
arbitrarily
on
a
shipment
that
went
from
carlsbad
through
detroit
to
toronto
beyond
montreal.
thereby
applying
the
same
formula,
you
come
up
with
an
excess
of
a
$1.28
a
ton.
more
than
twice
the
measure
of
unreasonableness
of
the
detroit
rates.
we
go
all
the
way
to
saint
john
to
brunswick.
you
come
up
with
an
excess
of
a
$1.80
per
ton.
i
should
mention
the
saint
john
situation
is
under
little
unusual
because
this
shipments
reentered
united
states
for
a
short
distance
across
northern
portion
of
the
state
of
maine
because
the
aiding
pacific
take
a
shortcut
across
there.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
wanted
to
know
exactly
what
the
railroads
did
in
complying
with
the
reparation
or
what
was
entered
here.
the
order
itself
here's
on
pages
19
and
21
of
the
record
that
contains
in
it
some
qualifying
language
in
two
places
that
it
applies
only
insofar
as
the
transportation
took
place
within
united
states.
so
when
the
claim
for
this
reparation
totaling
over
$6,600.00
of
total
transportation
charges
of
some
what
over
$100,000.00.
there
are
131
shipments
involved.
when
that
claim
for
the
$6,600.00
was
presented
to
the
auditor
of
the
freight
accounts
of
one
of
the
american
railroads,
which
was
the
origin
carrier
with
the
claim
for
payment.
he
computed
--
recomputed
the
award
by
deducting
a
division
representing
the
share
of
the
canadian
railroads
for
each
of
this
particular
shipments.
now
those
division
vary
--
divisions
vary
the
percentages
depending
upon
what
the
destination
in
canada
is
and
they
even
vary
depending
upon
which
particular
railroads
in
the
united
states
participated
in
the
movement.
but
on
a
weighted
average
basis,
the
division
of
the
canadian
railroads
comes
to
slightly
less
from
21%
and
that
is
how
we
computed
the
figure
of
$1,390.00
for
which
the
--
this
suit
was
brought.
now
when
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well
the
total
--
the
total
award
was
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
that
was
computed
split.
we
did
that
strictly
on
a
divisional
basis.
mr.
harvey
huston
that's
right.
mr.
harvey
huston
the
--
in
other
words,
the
revenue
was
divided
21%
to
the
canadian
railroad,
79%
to
the
american.
therefore
the
reparation
award
was
divided
in
the
same
manner.
so
the
american
railroads
paid
out
79%
and
said
that's
all
we're
going
to
pay.
now
when
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
federal
courts,
we
defended
on
two
grounds.
the
first
ground
was
the
fact
that
the
language
in
the
reparation
order
specifically
carried
these
restrictions
where
the
limitations
to
apply
of
transportation
performed
within
the
united
states
and
we
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
order
was
it
best
ambiguous.
if
you
can
look
at
the
dollar
amounts
in
the
reparation
order,
you
can
see
that
the
commission
applied
the
same
formula
as
it
had
done
on
domestic
shipments
that
saw
the
(inaudible)
case.
but
we
took
the
position
that
the
order
was
ambiguous
and
that
even
on
the
old
terms
of
the
commission's
order.
we
had
it
right
to
make
this
deduction.
that
point
was
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
it
was
not
specifically
resolved
one
way
or
another.
so
our
alternative
defense
those
that
assuming
the
dollar
amounts
in
the
commission's
award
take
precedents
over
this
limiting
language.
in
other
words,
ignore
the
limiting
language.
then
you
come
up
quite
frankly
against
the
lewis
case
which
--
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
so
heavily.
the
lewis
case
is
an
extension
of
the
news
syndicate
case
and
they
held
there
that
even
if
there
was
shown
the
existence
of
a
domestic
rate
covering
the
domestic
portion
of
a
few
transportation.
that
alone
was
not
enough
to
bring
it
out
from
underneath
the
rule
of
the
lewis
case
so
as
to
restrict
the
payment
of
repara
--
the
award
of
reparation
to
something
other
then
representing
the
complete
transportation
--
complete
international
transportation.
now
the
lewis
case,
the
court
hold
attention
to
that
that
when
a
defendant
filed
his
answer.
he
referred
to
this
domestic
rather
this
the
railroad,
referred
to
this
domestic
rate.
but
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
they
did
not
specifically
claim
that
it
was
maximum
reasonable
rate
and
three
or
four
other
chimes
in
this
opinion,
the
court
comments
on
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
maximum
reasonable
rate.
it's
our
position
that
the
lewis
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
merely
proving
that
aim
great
exist
between
the
two
united
states
portions
of
the
two
transportation
does
not
permit
a
reduction
in
the
reparation
award
so
as
to
exclude
any
extra
territorial
effect.
now,
we
think
the
significant
portion
of
this
decision
in
the
lewis
case
is
the
emphasis
upon
a
maximum
reasonable
rate.
and
here,
we
have
demonstrated
that
a
maximum
reasonable
standard.
we
don't
say
that
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
here
from
detroit
to
carlsbad
to
detroit
applied
to
these
shipments.
we
say
that
the
commission
itself
has
established
a
standard
or
shipment
of
potash
from
carlsbad
to
detroit
and
the
establishment
of
that
standard
by
commission
is
the
best
possible
proof
of
what
a
maximum
reasonable
proportion
would
be
of
the
through
international
rate.
mr.
harvey
huston
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
is
our
position
that
if
the
commission
in
other
words
had
set
up
a
maximum
reasonable
standard.
here
it
was
contemporaneous
the
same
period
january
5
through
may
5,
1948
--
mr.
harvey
huston
the
commission
has
twice
done
that.
the
commission
in
the
black
horse
tobacco
case
and
the
citizens
gas
utility
case,
a
recent
case
both
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
commission
in
effect
threw
up
his
hand,
they
said,
“this
is
undivided
whole
and
you
can't
chop
up
in
two
and
it
is
too
much
for
us.”
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
i
don't
think
there's
specific
holding.
i
--
i
think
the
lewis
case
should
be
interpreted
as
certainly
implying
that
the
result
might
be
different
if
they
had
evidence
of
a
maximum
reasonable
standard.
mr.
harvey
huston
in
principle?
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
i
think
it's
certainly
it
forces
the
commission
to
sta
--
to
recognize
the
same
standard
for
all
comparable
shipments.
in
other
words,
the
transportation
through
the
united
states
is
just
the
same.
and
i
think
the
arizona
grocery
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1932
is
very
pertinent
here.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
when
the
commission
had
once
established
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
between
two
points.
they
couldn't
go
back
later
and
say,
“well,
we
think
that
that
decision
was
wrong
and
someone
charging
was
charged
at
maximum
reasonable
rate
can
go
back
and
get
some
additional
reparation.”
now,
we
think
by
analogy
that
the
same
principle
applies
here
because
you
got
the
only
difference
between
the
shipments
from
carlsbad
to
detroit
were
this
maximum
reasonable
rate
was
established
is
some
additional
transportation
beyond
detroit
into
canada.
that's
the
only
difference
that
you
have
from
the
shipments
determining
at
carlsbad
--
at
detroit
at
the
border.
mr.
harvey
huston
i'm
very
much
afraid
that's
true.
the
commission
itself
voluntarily
on
a
few
occasions
has
done
somewhat
the
other
way,
the
carlowitz
case,
the
international
paper
case
both
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
there
the
commission
looked
only
if
the
reasonableness
of
the
american
factor
of
the
international
joint
rate
and
ruled
upon
that.
but
the
great
majority
of
instances,
they
form
the
other
way
and
refused
to
--
mr.
harvey
huston
i
would
certainly
think
that
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well
as
a
practical
matter,
of
course
here
it's
a
little
difficult
to
answer
your
question
because
here
the
commission
did
it
for
us.
mr.
harvey
huston
and
if
may
be
that
the
commission
could
take
the
positions
that,
well
in
the
future,
if
the
railroads
want
to
avoid
and
reparation
award
this
sort.
then
they
got
to
bring
in
some
sort
of
evidence
to
help
us
determine
what
would
be
the
maximum
reasonable
proportion.
mr.
harvey
huston
very
much
--
mr.
harvey
huston
i
don't
know
that
it
would
add
very
much.
certainly,
i
would
think
they
would
have
every
bit
of
cooperation
from
the
railroads
involve
that,
in
other
words,
it
means
a
financial
saving
to
them.
now,
the
commission
and
the
petitioner
are
both
called
attentions
in
their
briefs
to
the
proposal
made
by
the
solicitor
general
on
which
i'll
touch
in
just
minute
that
this
would
mean
that
railroads
would
have
to
bring
in
evidence
of
divisions
to
and
from
the
border
crossings
and
they
might
be
reluctant
to
do
that.
well,
i'm
sure
there
would
no
reluctance
where
it
would
be
a
financial
advantage
to
american
railroads
to
do
that.
mr.
harvey
huston
yes,
they
made
a
specific
finding
to
each
of
these
canadian
destinations
--
mr.
harvey
huston
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
our
theory
is
that
this
sets
up
a
standard
beyond
which
the
commission
cannot
--
mr.
harvey
huston
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
standard
applied
in
the
international
through
rate
was
the
identical
standards
that
they
applied
on
a
domestic
rate
to
detroit.
in
other
words,
the
difference
between
this
20%
interim
freight
rate
increase
at
a
maximum
of
$1.60
per
ton.
they
use
precisely
the
same
theory
and
the
same
formula.
and
so
you
get
to
these
results
that
i
have
called
attention
to
that
by
applying
the
same
formula.
they
would
require
a
refund
of
$0.62
per
ton
if
the
shipment
only
goes
to
detroit;
if
it
goes
beyond
the
toronto,
it
goes
up
to
$0.84;
if
beyond
that
to
montreal
its
$1.28;
saint
john
to
brunswick
it's
a
$1.80.
all
these
directed
traceable
to
additional
transportation
in
canada.
mr.
harvey
huston
oh,
i
think
certainly
if
the
commission
is
using
the
same
line
of
reasoning
in
both
examples.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
say
that
this
one
kind
of
a
thing
applies
which
is
a
domestic
shipment.
but
my
golly,
if
you're
going
to
go
on
beyond
in
the
canada,
we're
going
to
take
more
out
of
your
height.
this
is
the
whole
--
this
is
really
what's
--
what
are
annoyance
here
is?
mr.
harvey
huston
we're
asking
the
commission
to
follow
a
fix
--
a
consistent
standard.
i
think
i
also
should
mention
here
that
the
--
now
the
theory
of
the
court
below
in
the
canada
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
there
interpretation
of
precisely
how
this
reparation
should
be
paid
out
is
slightly
different
than
what
we
did
in
withholding
this
$1,390.00
out
of
divisional
basis.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
would
mean
simply
that
you
take
the
$0.62
a
ton
held
to
be
the
unreasonable
measure
on
shipments
going
to
starts
the
border
and
applied
to
have
--
to
the
total
tonnage
involved
here.
and
in
that
respect
you
come
out
with
the
total
reparation
figure.
that
however
is
not
a
matter
of
record
here
because
the
divisions
and
the
weights
of
the
various
shipments
are
not
a
part
of
the
record.
now
the
solicitor
general
has
a
third
method
of
calculating
damages
in
the
case
of
this
sort.
the
solicitor
general's
theory
that
if
the
commission
make
a
finding
of
max
of
--
a
finding
that
an
international
joint
rate
is
unreasonable.
before
awarding
reparation
they
must
make
a
subsidiary
finding
of
what
a
just
and
reasonable
proportion
of
that
should
be
for
the
domestic
portion
of
it.
so
in
other
words,
taking
the
example
of
a
shipment
to
toronto
for
instance,
the
commission
should
decide
that
what
would
be
on
a
true
shipment
to
toronto.
what
would
be
the
maximum
reasonable
proportion
up
to
the
detroit?
and
when
they
make
that
kind
of
determination
then,
they
compare
that
with
the
division
received
by
the
american
railroads
on
the
two
shipments
to
toronto.
and
if
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
to
detroit
is
less
than
the
division
actually
received
by
the
american
railroads,
that
division
must
be
turnover
to
or
in
this
case
it
would
be
canada
packers.
we
have
no
objection
in
theory
to
what
the
solicitor
general
suggests.
we
think
it's
a
good
practical
solution
which
should
be
fair
to
parties
in
these
cases.
in
this
particular
case,
we
contend
and
here
is
where
we
have
our
differences.
we
contend
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
this
a
specific
finding
because
the
commission
has
already
done
it
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case.
and
we
think
it
could
be
usual
thing
to
go
back
nearly
19
years
later
and
say,
“please
determine,
what
is
a
maximum
reasonable
proportion
from
carlsbad
to
detroit
on
this
1948
shipment.”
mr.
harvey
huston
oh!
not
necessarily.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
could
be
very
well
be
the
other
way.
mr.
harvey
huston
yes.
mr.
harvey
huston
it's
already
been
done.
now
this
--
mr.
harvey
huston
certainly.
mr.
harvey
huston
the
--
oh,
that's,
well
i
can
answer
that
question.
i
have
that
information
works
out.
in
other
words,
you
assume
that
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
to
detroit
would
be
found
to
be
of
proper
proportion.
mr.
harvey
huston
alright.
now
that
comes
to
$12.70
per
ton.
i
have
had
the
auditor
freight
accounts
of
one
of
the
railroads
here
make
a
determination
of
that
question
and
that
rate
produces
a
total
sum
of
something
over
$87,000.00.
now,
the
divisions
receive
by
the
united
states
carriers
on
these
shipments
come
to
something
over
$85,000.00.
so
on
that
theory,
the
canada
packers
should
not
have
any
reparation
at
all.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
also
that
possibly
the
--
that
maximum
reasonable
rate
to
detroit
might
not
be
appropriate
as
a
proportion
because
of
the
fact
that
presumably
the
rate
to
detroit
included
a
factor
for
the
terminal
services
involved
at
detroit
and
that
might
not
be
appropriate
for
a
shipment
going
beyond
detroit
determinating
at
toronto.
i
think
this
is
not
a
matter
of
great
moment.
the
commission
in
the
consolidated
rendering
case
in
discussing
this
potash
traffic
from
carlsbad
made
a
specific
comment
that
terminal
operations
on
this
traffic
are
relatively
simply.
so
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
a
serious
objection
that
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
think
the
enforcement
of
the
or
rather
i
think
the
restrictions
upon
the
commission's
reparation
of
award
would
then
determine
to
the
appropriate
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
have
a
great
deal
of
merit
because
if
you
don't
agree
with
that
conclusion,
in
effect
you're
telling
the
commission
that,
it's
alright
to
the
domestic
portion
to
find
that
rates
where
excessive
by
$0.62
a
ton,
if
you're
only
going
to
detroit
but
by
$0.84
a
ton,
a$1.28
a
ton
or
$1.80
a
ton
depending
on
how
far
you
go
into
canada.
i
don't
think
that
type
of
award
is
within
the
confines
of
the
jurisdictional
limitations
of
section
1
of
the
act.
and
we're
asking
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
