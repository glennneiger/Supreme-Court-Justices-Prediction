justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
ask
as
a
practical
matter.
assuming
now
news
syndicate
and
stan
and
lewis,
is
this
going
to
mean
that
hereafter
and
all
of
these
reparations
cases
where
international
rates
were
involved?
the
commission
will
have
to
determine
the
maximum
reasonable
rates
for
the
american
segment?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter,
is
that
what's
going
to
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
imagine
these
things
are
already
take
a
good
deal
of
time,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what's
this
going
to
add
to
the
commission's
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
i
gather
the
railroads
in
this
instance
for
example.
the
initial
charge
was
fixed
to
what
by
which
railroad
or
was
it
by
being
to
the
canadian
and
american
carriers,
how
was
it
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
--
is
it
ordinarily
done
by
agreement
of
the
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
tariff
is
filed
i
gather
by
the
american
--
would
be
in
this
instance,
i
suppose
by
the
american
carrier
since
the
ships
(voice
overlap)
originated
in
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
shipper
has
no
choice
but
to
pay
whatever
he
is
suppose
to
pay,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
order
to
this
then
there's
no
joint
through
rate
then?
that
if
he
withdraws
at
least
from
that
joint
through
rate
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
alternative
for
the
shipper
to
pay
the
rate
and
then
to
attempt
to
in
a
reparation
proceeding
that
would
cover
any
excess,
is
that
it?
