the

is
the
full

--
justice

including
any
of
the
testimony
that
--

justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
--
i
would
be
interested
in
knowing
whether
or
not
the
clerk's
transcript
system
that
you
call
it,
is
something
that
is
used
regularly
by
lawyers
who
have
examined
the
record
and
have
decided
on
their
own
that
there
is
nothing
really
to
appeal
here.
or
whether
or
not
--
or
whether
from
the
contrary
in
this
case
counsel
simply
neglected
the
work.
i
think
if
a
paid
counsel
sometimes,
the
paid
counsel
–
we
have
had
cases
here
or
at
least
request
to
take
cases
in
which
the
counsel
simply
has
neglected
to
take
the
necessary
steps
within
the
required
time.
and
then
the
--
the
defendant
who
doesn't
get
his
appeal
asks
for
habeas
corpus
or
something
else
to
let
--
to
make
the
state
give
him
--
giving
him
an
appeal
and
know
it
was
--
it's
neglected
his
counsel,
his
own
hired
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
--
what
is
it
in
this
case?
is
this
the
way
that
the
iowa
lawyer,
appointed
lawyer
used
to
--
to
--
to
let
the
court
know
we
don't
think
if
there's
any
merit
in
the
case
or
do
they
just
not
do
the
work
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
you
mean,
there's
--
the
record
does
contain
some
expression
by
him
that
--
that
there's
no
merit.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
the
rule
should
be?
is
there
a
constitutional
rule?
let's
assume
that
this
man
had
hired
his
own
counsel?
and
his
own
counsel,
instead
of
taking
appeal,
then
he
just
didn't
do
it.
what
would
you
--
would
you
say
that
it's
a
constitutional
rule
that
the
defendant
has
--
may
have
an
appeal
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
that's
not
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
if,
but
do
you
think
there
should
be
a
constitutional
rule
if
appointed
counsel
makes
this
same
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
it
happens
all
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
the
appointed
counsel,
the
defendant
with
hired
counsel
who
haven't
--
the
hired
counsel
went
through
the
same
procedure,
would
have
received
exactly
the
same
treatment
as
the
supreme
court,
wouldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
makes
a
constitutional
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
iowa
--
the
--
by
the
transcript
system,
the
iowa
court
never
gets
around
looking
at
the
printed
record
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
never
passes
on
anything
that
was
raised
on
the
motion
for
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
one
step
beyond
the
california
as
we
heard
about
yesterday?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
--
in
this
case,
the
state
did
appoint
counsel
to
represent
him
on
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
sole
--
the
state
furnished
him
counsel
and
the
counsel
either
decided
this
to
submit
it
on
the
clerk's
transcript
because
he
didn't
see
any
merit
in
it
or
simply
neglected
to
proceed
with
the
appeal
which
he's
told
this
company
or
his
client
that
he
was
proceeding
with.
is
there
any
indication
in
this
record
which
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
--
or
would
--
you
would
suggest
then
that
the
constitutional
rule
in
appointed
cases,
in
appointed
cases,
the
--
the
appeal
would
not
be
disposed
of
for
any
reason
without
a
full
record
in
the
appearance
of
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
i
--
what
i
wonder
is
that
why
do
you
think
the
defendant
should
not
be
charged
with
the
error
or
neglect
of
his
counsel,
like
he
might
well
be
if
the
counsel
was
retained?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that
really
what
i
am
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
rule
as
saying
that
the
both
appointive
and
hired
counsel
--
what
is
unconstitutional
there?
same
reason,
different
lawyer,
equal
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
it's
a
constitutional
should
be
the
same,
what
is
--
what
is
the
constitutional
error
if
--
if
they
affirm
on
a
clerk's
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
why
is
it
wrong?
what's
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
really
--
that's
a
--
so,
are
you
conceding
in
this
case
a
constitutional
violation
of
equal
protection
or
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
make
the
same
concession
if
on
the
same
facts
retained
counsel
did
the
same
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
full
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
the
state
action
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
would
you
--
would
you
charge
the
state
with
the
--
with
the
neglect
of
any
appointed
counsel
because
he
was
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
--
are
you
making
the
same
statements
up
here
if
the
court
had
--
had
not
decided
the
appeal,
but
it
just
dismissed
it
on
these
facts?
though
he
didn't
get
his
appeal
and
then
--
and
for
the
same
reasons
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
--
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
of
--
you
talked
about
the
clerk's
trans
--
transcript
system,
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
from
your
argument,
the
facts
are
that
you
have
appointed
counsel
who
--
who
neglected
this
to
carry
through
on
the
appeal.
and
we
say
this
is
a
constitutional
error
or
you
--
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that's
it's
a
constitutional
error
when
the
appointed
counsel
neglects
to
do
his
job?
and
that
[inaudible]
about
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
have
come
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
you
in
net
effect,
but
--
but
you
--
i
guess
you
say
that
the
--
the
--
at
least
it's
an
error
when
the
court
knows
--
when
the
court
knows
that
the
counsel
is
being
ineffective?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
a
--
that
was
a
transcript
--
was
that
a
transcript
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
that
was
indiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defender
is
not
in
this
--
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
bears
--
it
also
bears
on
whether
or
not
the
counsel
made
any
--
actually
decided
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
belin,
what
if
there
are
two
cases
before
the
iowa
supreme
court
exactly
like
this
one
where
the
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
and
one
of
the
case
the
counsel
was
appointed
and
in
the
other
case,
the
counsel
was
retained?
exactly
the
same
thing
[inaudible]
in
this
case,
do
you
think
it
will
have
the
identical
results?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
deprivation,
[inaudible]
deprivation
as
to
both
of
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
--
what's
the
state
charge
if
anything
in
an
appointed
counsel
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
in
the
--
in
the
retained
counsel?
justice
byron

there
would
be
the

with
