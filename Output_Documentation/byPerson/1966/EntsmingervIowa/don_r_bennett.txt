mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i'm
going
to
be
very
brief
this
morning
because
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
already
pointed
out,
we
more
or
less
conceded
the
case
insofar
as
a
remand
being
necessary.
i
would
give
you
just
a
little
background.
i
think
you
would
be
interested
in
the
background
as
to
why
the
attorney
general
would
be
willing
to
come
into
court
--
into
this
court
and
confess
error
on
the
case.
and
in
fact
i
would
have
supposed
i
wouldn't
even
be
here
today
but
for
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
the
question
of
the
underlying
merits.
i
went
from
the
department
of
justice
here
in
town
to
work
for
van
nuys,
lawrence
scalise
who
is
no
longer
attorney
general
of
iowa.
and
he
had
brought
me
in
to
handle
criminal
--
criminal
appeals
and
i
recall
that
the
first
conference
we
had
was
about
editorials
that
were
being
written
regarding
the
clerk's
transcript
system.
the
writer
of
these
editorials
is
a
resident
of
des
moines
and
writes
for
the
des
moines
registrant
tribunal
and
he
had
been
suggesting
that
the
clerk's
transcript
appeal
system
was
used
by
some
attorneys
to
--
some
attorneys
to
give
the
appearance
of
their
appointed
or
the
client
for
which
they
were
appointed
actually
getting
appeal
and
the
client
not
getting
such
an
appeal
and
there
was
some
evidence
to
this
effect.
but
anyway,
the
attorney
general
asked
me
if
i
would
do
some
research
into
it
and
try
to
come
up
with
some
conclusions
and
some
recommendations.
as
things
worked
out,
i
never
had
the
time
to
do
that
research
because
of
the
pressing
number
of
appeals
and
never
got
into
the
problem
until
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
enstminger
case
and
it's
obvious
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
petitioner
did
desire
an
appeal
as
was
expressed
in
the
record
and
as
you
will
find
in
our
brief,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
say
we
will
relinquish
the
desire
to
have
plenary
review
the
merits
of
the
proceedings
culminating
any
his
conviction
and
he
didn't
receive
it.
i
concede
to
you
in
all
candor
that
clerk's
transcript
does
not
present
an
adequate
record
upon
which
an
individual
can
obtain
meaningful
review.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
this
case.
i
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
a
reversal
could
occur
because
of
review
of
the
clerk's
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
or
the
griffin
versus
california
error
where
the
instructions
are
part
of
the
clerk's
transcript
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
and
the
court
--
yes
and
the
court
has
charged
the
jury
relative
to
the
defendant
enstminger
to
take
witness
stand.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
should
result
on
reversal?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
there's
--
unfortunately,
there
is
no
uniformity
among
the
various
clerks
in
the
state
but,
by
and
large,
you
can
expect
to
find
a
copy
of
either
the
indictment
or
the
information.
iowa
uses
both
systems.
a
copy
of
the
arraignment,
a
copy
of
the
--
the
arraignment
or
plea,
probably
a
copy
of
the
verdict,
the
sentence,
most
often
but
not
always,
the
charge
to
the
jury
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
clerk's
transcript
also
contained
a
copy
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
raising
the
various
constitutional
issues.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
except
--
i
appreciate
that
whenever
clerk's
transcript
is
used
for
a
review
there
is
no
argument.
it's
not
an
adversary
proceeding
at
all.
it's
simply
is
the
court
reviewing
the
clerk's
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
what
happens
is
the
--
the
printed
record,
this
is
an
abstract
of
the
record,
it's
not
usually
the
full
trial
record
and
the
trial
transcript.
the
--
oh,
i
lost
my
thought
early
--
the
idea
was
trying
to
put
across
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
this
is
very
conceivable.
in
my
months
in
the
office,
this
has
not
happened.
the
clerk's
transcript
system
has
been
utilized
only
where
the
court
reviews
it
itself
and
there
is
no
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no
briefing,
no
record,
just
the
clerk's
transcript.
now
this
is
equivalent
by
the
way
to
what
his
court
has
spoken
off
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
if
you
--
i
think
check
at
footnote
2
at
that
opinion,
the
mandatory
record
referred
to
in
that
case
is
very
similar
to
the
clerk's
transcript
in
our
case
or
in
the
case
of
iowa.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
and
this
case
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
would
say
that
the
indications
in
the
record
probably
go
to
more
of
the
--
more
of
neglect
of
some
sort
rather
than
counsel
having
come
to
a
conclusion
that
the
appeal
was
frivolous.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
because
counsel
had
written
the
petitioner
on
two
different
occasions;
once
in
march
and
once
again
in
september
indicating
that
a
--
that
a
brief
or
a
record
would
be
filed.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
if
i
follow
your
question
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
this
given
--
in
this
case?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
now
--
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
am
not
certain.
you
--
you
addressed
the
same
question
to
mr.
belin.
i
am
not
certain
that
if
--
if
retained
counsel
did
nothing
without
the
knowledge
of
his
client
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
–
and
his
client
received
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
that
you
wouldn't
have
a
constitutional
problem
there.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
you
could
express
it
--
you
could
express
that
in
--
in
terms
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
or
something
of
that
akin
and
this
would
entitle
that
individual
to
relief.
in
this
case,
we
have
something
that
--
i
have
a
record
here
or
we
have
a
record,
it's
not
of
our
making
and
we
have
something
in
this
case
that
goes
a
step
further
than
that.
the
court
was
apprised
by
the
petitioner
several
days
prior
to
the
time
that
they
affirmed
his
conviction
on
the
clerk's
transcripts.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
the
case
of
a
retained
counsel?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
in
the
case
of
the
indigent
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
because
if
you
say
that
they
used
the
clerk's
transcript
on
which
to
affirm
in
both
--
in
both
the
appointed
case
and
in
the
retained
case,
you
say
that
--
that's
that
--
that's
wrong.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
in
the
case
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
the
case
of
the
indigent,
and
in
keeping
with
this
court's
decisions
starting
with
griffin
versus
illinois,
right
on
down
to
the
one
that
the
court
decided,
i
understand
a
week
or
a
few
days
ago,
you
could
spell
out
the
constitutional
violation
where
the
indigent
is
concerned
by
state
stating
that
he
has
not
received
adequate
and
full
plenary
review
to
which
he
is
entitled
and
the
reason
he
hasn't
received
it
is
because
he
wasn't
able
to
fire
an
attorney.
had
he
been
able
to
hire
an
attorney,
he
could
have
kept
some
control
over
his
attorney.
mr.
enstminger
could
have
--
in
checking
up
now
you
say
you're
going
to
get
the
brief
and
where
is
the
brief?
now
in
the
case
of
the
retained
attorney,
i
suppose
you
could
--
i
could
only
say
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
perhaps
you
could
use
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
this
question
has
bothered
me
and
one
that
i
haven't
really
come
to
resolve
myself,
but
i
do
believe
that
under
this
record
we
would
have
to
concede
that
this
indigent
was
not
or
did
not
obtain
whole
and
effective
appellate
review
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
that
within
this
court's
decisions,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
relief
for
that
reason.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
--
i'm
willing
to
state
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
believe
i
would
make
the
concession
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
violation
if
he
did
nothing
and
that
his
client
--
and
didn't
let
his
client
know
of
anything.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
court
ordered
a
complete
transcripts
mr.
justice
harlan
before
the
clerk's
transcripts
was
ever
filed?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
new
trial,
and
at
the
date
of
sentencing,
the
petitioner
said
he
wanted
to
take
an
appeal.
counsel
had
been
appointed
to
help
on
the
new
trial,
he
was
requested
to
stay
and
assist
him
in
connection
with
the
appeal
and
the
counsel
said
it
was
alright,
where
upon
the
court
said,
“i'm
appointing
this
counsel
to
assist
you
on
appeal
and
directing
that
a
free
transcript
be
ordered
for
you.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
full
transcript,
that's
his
transcript
right
here,
you
have
it.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
it
was
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
it
was
mostly
the
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
mostly
the
fault
of
the
lawyer,
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
cannot
--
in
all
fairness,
i
must
say
that
the
record
shows
there
was
some
fault
on
behalf
of
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
court
was
advised
by
what
the
petitioner
denominated,
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
advised
some
eleven
or
12
days
before
they
ultimately
affirmed
the
conviction
on
a
clerk's
transcript,
advised
in
this
pleading
that
he
was
not
happy
with
--
with
the
way
that
counsel
was
proceeding
with
this
appeal.
and
so
in
this
case,
we
have
a
record
which
goes
a
little
beyond
counsel's
inaction.
we
have
a
record
showing
that
the
iowa
court
was
advised
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
complaining
about
the
way
the
appeal
went,
nonetheless,
it
was
affirmed
on
the
clerk's
transcript
a
few
days
later.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
your
honor,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
allows
the
counsel
appointed
to
represent
indigents
to
do
nothing
and
to
the
extent
that
the
ultimate
per
curium
opinion
leads
those
indigents
into
believe
that
they've
got
--
leads
the
indigents
in
to
believing
that
they've
got
a
full
appeal,
then
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
system.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
ready
to
say
that
as
a
blanket
statement
for
all
cases.
every
lawyer
that
--
who
handles
any
criminal
appeals
at
all
in
iowa
knows
that
the
clerk's
transcript
is
quite
often
used
as
a
delaying
tactic,
a
time
to
let
the
man
put
his
orders
in
affair
or
put
his
affairs
and
order.
it's
also
occasionally
used
where
an
attorney
has
reviewed
the
record,
felt
that
any
appeal
would
be
frivolous,
goes
to
his
client
and
advises
his
client
at
this
sits
down
and
talks
about
it.
the
client
agrees
with
the
counsel
and
so
he
let's
go
on
the
clerk's
transcript.
so
there
are
situations
in
which
the
clerk's
transcript
is
certainly
being
utilized
without
there
being
any
--
any
suggestion
of
the
constitutional
taint
to
its
use.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
we
have
suggested
to
the
iowa
court
and
some
proposed
rule
changes
which
they
have
told
us
they
will
consider
and
which
are
incorporated
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
that
they
ought
to
do
way
with
the
clerk's
transcript
appeal,
that
what
they
should
do
is
to
dismiss
the
appeal
with
prejudice
if
the
record
or
the
briefs
are
not
filed
on
time
or
with
any
--
or
with
any
enlargement
of
time.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
substantially
it.
i
--
i
would,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
like
in
all
fairness
to
the
court,
to
the
iowa
court
to
say
that
--
that
they
did
not
ignore
that
notice.
this
is
a
situation
i
--
i
realize
this
is
not
important
where
this
record
is
concerned
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
situation
where
they
simply
got
more
work
and
they
can
keep
up
with
and
as
one
hand
doing
what
the
other
doesn't
know.
so
this
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
not
being
proper
and
informed
was
summarily
denied
without
even
being
aware
that
harvey
lyle
enstminger
was
also
some
place
else.
but
of
course
we're
stuck
with
the
record
as
it
shows.
now,
to
proceed
this
a
step
further,
we've
asked
the
iowa
court
in
connection
with
these
proposed
rule
changes
that
they
spell
out,
what
we
--
what
we
think
or
what
this
court
might
hold
to
be
the
obligation
of
counsel,
to
spell
it
out
in
black
and
white
and
tell
the
attorneys
of
the
state
of
iowa
what
is
expected
of
them
whenever
they
are
appointed
to
represent
an
indigent
and
i
think
that's
necessary
because
in
my
limited
experience
i
have
seen
some
abuse
and
this
is
not
been
the
only
case.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
would
have
the
same
problem,
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
don't
think
you
would
have
the
problem
mr.
justice
white,
of
the
--
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
allowing
this
(voice
overlap)
quite
so
readily
as
where
you
would
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
i
point
out
in
my
brief
that
counsel
--
the
appointed
counsel
is
not
expected
to
gratuitously
serve.
they
are
not
paid
as
well
as
retained
lawyers
are
obviously,
but
they
do
get
a
reasonable
compensation,
and
that
varies
from
court
to
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
they
are
appointed
by
the
district
courts.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
don't
know
whether
they
ever
be
in
a
situation
like
there
or
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
assume
the
iowa
court
will
not
act
upon
the
proposed
rule
changes
until
such
time
as
this
court
has
decided
not
only
in
the
enstminger
case
but
also
the
california
case
that
was
acted
upon
yesterday.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
i'm
sure
that
whatever
guidelines
are
there
might
go
a
long
way
toward
--
they're
accepting
some
proposal
like
we
have
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
know
that
--
i
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
can't
come
before
(voice
overlap)
i
can't
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
mr.
enstminger
wasn't
treated
better
than
was
douglas
or
was
brown
i
guess
it
was,
in
lane
versus
brown.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
--
i
think
it's
an
error
in
either
case.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
but
i
think
--
simply
boils
down
to
what
constitutional
proposition
you're
going
to
pin
it
to.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
think
on
this
record,
you
get
to
find
the
same
--
i
think
on
this
record,
you've
got
to
find
the
same
type
of
constitutional
defect
that
you
found
in
lane
versus
brown
for
the
relatively
unanimous
court.
this
case
is
not
at
all
--
unlike
lane
versus
brown.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
was
a
transcript
problem.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
was
indiana.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
know
that
all
the
scholars
are
in
agreement
as
to
just
exactly
whether
it
was
equal
protection
or
due
process,
but
one
of
the
two.
lane
versus
brown
involved
a
situation
where
a
public
defender
refused
to
obtain
a
transcript
so
that
mr.
brown,
i
think,
it
was
could
take
his
appeal.
the
transcript
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
appeal,
to
the
indiana
supreme
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
it
is
not
this
case
exactly.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
a
full
transcript
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
full
transcript
was
made
available
by
the
trial
court.
the
iowa
supreme
court
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
they
never
saw
it.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
he
had
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
under
the
facts
--
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case,
i
would
still
have
to
comeback
and
say
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
denial
--
that
the
indigent
was
denied
full
and
effective
appellate
review
and
i
suppose
we're
talking
about
either
an
equal
protection
or
due
process
problem
if
it
were
simply
negligence
or
neglect
on
it
behalf
of
the
counsel,
then
i
suppose
we're
talking
about
an
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel
which
is
still
a
due
process
proposition
as
i
understand
it.
frankly,
we
are
now
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
frankly,
i'm
floundering
a
little
bit
because
i
haven't
given
this.
i
tried
to
tie
it
down
to
some
specific
phase.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
say
this
that
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
man,
an
indigent
designed
an
appeal
from
his
conviction
had
the
right
to
full
plenary
review
of
the
proceedings
culminating
in
that
conviction.
now,
this
he
didn't
get.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
except
for
the
neglect
of
his
counsel
apparently
and
to
that
extent,
he
was
denied
due
process.
he
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
given
the
type
of
appeal
to
which
he
wan
entitled
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
oh,
that's
--
that
is
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
a
more
expressly
spelled
out
in
mr.
belin's
brief,
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
do
have
a
mixture
of
both
of
these
things.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
think
any
action
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
supreme
court
itself
deprived
the
man
of
counsel
in
a
meaningful
sense
because
counsel
had
been
appointed
in
the
trial
court
but
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
without
any
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
if
--
if
it
were
not
possible
for
the
--
in
this
situation
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
it
were
not
possible
for
the
defendant
to
retain
further
counsel,
the
court
would
see
that
counsel
was
appointed
-
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
to
represent
him.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
this
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
i
believe
so.
well,
i'd
like
to
--
since
mr.
belin
has
pressed
the
merits
of
the
search
and
seizure
and
self-incrimination
argument,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
few
seconds
to
explain
to
the
court
why
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
alright
i
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
mr.
belin
thinks
they
are.
he
expressed
them.
apparently,
the
merits
were
pressed
in
douglas
versus
california
as
i
recall
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark
and
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
and
one
of
the
footnotes
indicates
that
they
were
pressing
the
merits
on
this
court
in
douglas
versus
california
and
the
court
didn't
decide
them.
but
i
would
say
this,
you've
got
a
copy
of
the
trial
transcript
up
here
and
you
don't
have
to
read
it
too
carefully
to
find
out
there
is
some
real
difficult
question
on
whether
a
man
consented
to
these
--
to
the
use
of
these
papers
or
whether
within
schmerber
versus
california,
he
hasn't
waived
any
--
waived
any
argument
on
the
merits
of
search
and
seizure
and
self-incrimination
argument
because
of
his
failure
to
raise
timely
objections.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i'm
going
to
be
very
brief
this
morning
because
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
already
pointed
out,
we
more
or
less
conceded
the
case
insofar
as
a
remand
being
necessary.
i
would
give
you
just
a
little
background.
i
think
you
would
be
interested
in
the
background
as
to
why
the
attorney
general
would
be
willing
to
come
into
court
--
into
this
court
and
confess
error
on
the
case.
and
in
fact
i
would
have
supposed
i
wouldn't
even
be
here
today
but
for
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
the
question
of
the
underlying
merits.
i
went
from
the
department
of
justice
here
in
town
to
work
for
van
nuys,
lawrence
scalise
who
is
no
longer
attorney
general
of
iowa.
and
he
had
brought
me
in
to
handle
criminal
--
criminal
appeals
and
i
recall
that
the
first
conference
we
had
was
about
editorials
that
were
being
written
regarding
the
clerk's
transcript
system.
the
writer
of
these
editorials
is
a
resident
of
des
moines
and
writes
for
the
des
moines
registrant
tribunal
and
he
had
been
suggesting
that
the
clerk's
transcript
appeal
system
was
used
by
some
attorneys
to
--
some
attorneys
to
give
the
appearance
of
their
appointed
or
the
client
for
which
they
were
appointed
actually
getting
appeal
and
the
client
not
getting
such
an
appeal
and
there
was
some
evidence
to
this
effect.
but
anyway,
the
attorney
general
asked
me
if
i
would
do
some
research
into
it
and
try
to
come
up
with
some
conclusions
and
some
recommendations.
as
things
worked
out,
i
never
had
the
time
to
do
that
research
because
of
the
pressing
number
of
appeals
and
never
got
into
the
problem
until
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
enstminger
case
and
it's
obvious
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
petitioner
did
desire
an
appeal
as
was
expressed
in
the
record
and
as
you
will
find
in
our
brief,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
say
we
will
relinquish
the
desire
to
have
plenary
review
the
merits
of
the
proceedings
culminating
any
his
conviction
and
he
didn't
receive
it.
i
concede
to
you
in
all
candor
that
clerk's
transcript
does
not
present
an
adequate
record
upon
which
an
individual
can
obtain
meaningful
review.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
this
case.
i
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
a
reversal
could
occur
because
of
review
of
the
clerk's
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
or
the
griffin
versus
california
error
where
the
instructions
are
part
of
the
clerk's
transcript
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
and
the
court
--
yes
and
the
court
has
charged
the
jury
relative
to
the
defendant
enstminger
to
take
witness
stand.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
should
result
on
reversal?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
there's
--
unfortunately,
there
is
no
uniformity
among
the
various
clerks
in
the
state
but,
by
and
large,
you
can
expect
to
find
a
copy
of
either
the
indictment
or
the
information.
iowa
uses
both
systems.
a
copy
of
the
arraignment,
a
copy
of
the
--
the
arraignment
or
plea,
probably
a
copy
of
the
verdict,
the
sentence,
most
often
but
not
always,
the
charge
to
the
jury
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
clerk's
transcript
also
contained
a
copy
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
raising
the
various
constitutional
issues.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
except
--
i
appreciate
that
whenever
clerk's
transcript
is
used
for
a
review
there
is
no
argument.
it's
not
an
adversary
proceeding
at
all.
it's
simply
is
the
court
reviewing
the
clerk's
transcript.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
what
happens
is
the
--
the
printed
record,
this
is
an
abstract
of
the
record,
it's
not
usually
the
full
trial
record
and
the
trial
transcript.
the
--
oh,
i
lost
my
thought
early
--
the
idea
was
trying
to
put
across
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
this
is
very
conceivable.
in
my
months
in
the
office,
this
has
not
happened.
the
clerk's
transcript
system
has
been
utilized
only
where
the
court
reviews
it
itself
and
there
is
no
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
right.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no
briefing,
no
record,
just
the
clerk's
transcript.
now
this
is
equivalent
by
the
way
to
what
his
court
has
spoken
off
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
if
you
--
i
think
check
at
footnote
2
at
that
opinion,
the
mandatory
record
referred
to
in
that
case
is
very
similar
to
the
clerk's
transcript
in
our
case
or
in
the
case
of
iowa.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
and
this
case
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
would
say
that
the
indications
in
the
record
probably
go
to
more
of
the
--
more
of
neglect
of
some
sort
rather
than
counsel
having
come
to
a
conclusion
that
the
appeal
was
frivolous.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
because
counsel
had
written
the
petitioner
on
two
different
occasions;
once
in
march
and
once
again
in
september
indicating
that
a
--
that
a
brief
or
a
record
would
be
filed.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
if
i
follow
your
question
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
this
given
--
in
this
case?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
now
--
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
am
not
certain.
you
--
you
addressed
the
same
question
to
mr.
belin.
i
am
not
certain
that
if
--
if
retained
counsel
did
nothing
without
the
knowledge
of
his
client
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
–
and
his
client
received
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
that
you
wouldn't
have
a
constitutional
problem
there.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
you
could
express
it
--
you
could
express
that
in
--
in
terms
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
or
something
of
that
akin
and
this
would
entitle
that
individual
to
relief.
in
this
case,
we
have
something
that
--
i
have
a
record
here
or
we
have
a
record,
it's
not
of
our
making
and
we
have
something
in
this
case
that
goes
a
step
further
than
that.
the
court
was
apprised
by
the
petitioner
several
days
prior
to
the
time
that
they
affirmed
his
conviction
on
the
clerk's
transcripts.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
the
case
of
a
retained
counsel?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
in
the
case
of
the
indigent
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
because
if
you
say
that
they
used
the
clerk's
transcript
on
which
to
affirm
in
both
--
in
both
the
appointed
case
and
in
the
retained
case,
you
say
that
--
that's
that
--
that's
wrong.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
in
the
case
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
in
the
case
of
the
indigent,
and
in
keeping
with
this
court's
decisions
starting
with
griffin
versus
illinois,
right
on
down
to
the
one
that
the
court
decided,
i
understand
a
week
or
a
few
days
ago,
you
could
spell
out
the
constitutional
violation
where
the
indigent
is
concerned
by
state
stating
that
he
has
not
received
adequate
and
full
plenary
review
to
which
he
is
entitled
and
the
reason
he
hasn't
received
it
is
because
he
wasn't
able
to
fire
an
attorney.
had
he
been
able
to
hire
an
attorney,
he
could
have
kept
some
control
over
his
attorney.
mr.
enstminger
could
have
--
in
checking
up
now
you
say
you're
going
to
get
the
brief
and
where
is
the
brief?
now
in
the
case
of
the
retained
attorney,
i
suppose
you
could
--
i
could
only
say
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
perhaps
you
could
use
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
this
question
has
bothered
me
and
one
that
i
haven't
really
come
to
resolve
myself,
but
i
do
believe
that
under
this
record
we
would
have
to
concede
that
this
indigent
was
not
or
did
not
obtain
whole
and
effective
appellate
review
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
that
within
this
court's
decisions,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
relief
for
that
reason.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
--
i'm
willing
to
state
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
believe
i
would
make
the
concession
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
violation
if
he
did
nothing
and
that
his
client
--
and
didn't
let
his
client
know
of
anything.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
court
ordered
a
complete
transcripts
mr.
justice
harlan
before
the
clerk's
transcripts
was
ever
filed?
mr.
don
r.
bennett
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
new
trial,
and
at
the
date
of
sentencing,
the
petitioner
said
he
wanted
to
take
an
appeal.
counsel
had
been
appointed
to
help
on
the
new
trial,
he
was
requested
to
stay
and
assist
him
in
connection
with
the
appeal
and
the
counsel
said
it
was
alright,
where
upon
the
court
said,
“i'm
appointing
this
counsel
to
assist
you
on
appeal
and
directing
that
a
free
transcript
be
ordered
for
you.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
full
transcript,
that's
his
transcript
right
here,
you
have
it.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
it
was
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
it
was
mostly
the
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
mostly
the
fault
of
the
lawyer,
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
cannot
--
in
all
fairness,
i
must
say
that
the
record
shows
there
was
some
fault
on
behalf
of
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
court
was
advised
by
what
the
petitioner
denominated,
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
advised
some
eleven
or
12
days
before
they
ultimately
affirmed
the
conviction
on
a
clerk's
transcript,
advised
in
this
pleading
that
he
was
not
happy
with
--
with
the
way
that
counsel
was
proceeding
with
this
appeal.
and
so
in
this
case,
we
have
a
record
which
goes
a
little
beyond
counsel's
inaction.
we
have
a
record
showing
that
the
iowa
court
was
advised
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
complaining
about
the
way
the
appeal
went,
nonetheless,
it
was
affirmed
on
the
clerk's
transcript
a
few
days
later.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
your
honor,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
allows
the
counsel
appointed
to
represent
indigents
to
do
nothing
and
to
the
extent
that
the
ultimate
per
curium
opinion
leads
those
indigents
into
believe
that
they've
got
--
leads
the
indigents
in
to
believing
that
they've
got
a
full
appeal,
then
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
system.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
ready
to
say
that
as
a
blanket
statement
for
all
cases.
every
lawyer
that
--
who
handles
any
criminal
appeals
at
all
in
iowa
knows
that
the
clerk's
transcript
is
quite
often
used
as
a
delaying
tactic,
a
time
to
let
the
man
put
his
orders
in
affair
or
put
his
affairs
and
order.
it's
also
occasionally
used
where
an
attorney
has
reviewed
the
record,
felt
that
any
appeal
would
be
frivolous,
goes
to
his
client
and
advises
his
client
at
this
sits
down
and
talks
about
it.
the
client
agrees
with
the
counsel
and
so
he
let's
go
on
the
clerk's
transcript.
so
there
are
situations
in
which
the
clerk's
transcript
is
certainly
being
utilized
without
there
being
any
--
any
suggestion
of
the
constitutional
taint
to
its
use.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
we
have
suggested
to
the
iowa
court
and
some
proposed
rule
changes
which
they
have
told
us
they
will
consider
and
which
are
incorporated
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
that
they
ought
to
do
way
with
the
clerk's
transcript
appeal,
that
what
they
should
do
is
to
dismiss
the
appeal
with
prejudice
if
the
record
or
the
briefs
are
not
filed
on
time
or
with
any
--
or
with
any
enlargement
of
time.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
substantially
it.
i
--
i
would,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
like
in
all
fairness
to
the
court,
to
the
iowa
court
to
say
that
--
that
they
did
not
ignore
that
notice.
this
is
a
situation
i
--
i
realize
this
is
not
important
where
this
record
is
concerned
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
situation
where
they
simply
got
more
work
and
they
can
keep
up
with
and
as
one
hand
doing
what
the
other
doesn't
know.
so
this
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
not
being
proper
and
informed
was
summarily
denied
without
even
being
aware
that
harvey
lyle
enstminger
was
also
some
place
else.
but
of
course
we're
stuck
with
the
record
as
it
shows.
now,
to
proceed
this
a
step
further,
we've
asked
the
iowa
court
in
connection
with
these
proposed
rule
changes
that
they
spell
out,
what
we
--
what
we
think
or
what
this
court
might
hold
to
be
the
obligation
of
counsel,
to
spell
it
out
in
black
and
white
and
tell
the
attorneys
of
the
state
of
iowa
what
is
expected
of
them
whenever
they
are
appointed
to
represent
an
indigent
and
i
think
that's
necessary
because
in
my
limited
experience
i
have
seen
some
abuse
and
this
is
not
been
the
only
case.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
you
would
have
the
same
problem,
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
don't
think
you
would
have
the
problem
mr.
justice
white,
of
the
--
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
allowing
this
(voice
overlap)
quite
so
readily
as
where
you
would
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
i
point
out
in
my
brief
that
counsel
--
the
appointed
counsel
is
not
expected
to
gratuitously
serve.
they
are
not
paid
as
well
as
retained
lawyers
are
obviously,
but
they
do
get
a
reasonable
compensation,
and
that
varies
from
court
to
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
they
are
appointed
by
the
district
courts.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
don't
know
whether
they
ever
be
in
a
situation
like
there
or
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
assume
the
iowa
court
will
not
act
upon
the
proposed
rule
changes
until
such
time
as
this
court
has
decided
not
only
in
the
enstminger
case
but
also
the
california
case
that
was
acted
upon
yesterday.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
i'm
sure
that
whatever
guidelines
are
there
might
go
a
long
way
toward
--
they're
accepting
some
proposal
like
we
have
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
know
that
--
i
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
can't
come
before
(voice
overlap)
i
can't
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
mr.
enstminger
wasn't
treated
better
than
was
douglas
or
was
brown
i
guess
it
was,
in
lane
versus
brown.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
--
i
think
it's
an
error
in
either
case.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
but
i
think
--
simply
boils
down
to
what
constitutional
proposition
you're
going
to
pin
it
to.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
think
on
this
record,
you
get
to
find
the
same
--
i
think
on
this
record,
you've
got
to
find
the
same
type
of
constitutional
defect
that
you
found
in
lane
versus
brown
for
the
relatively
unanimous
court.
this
case
is
not
at
all
--
unlike
lane
versus
brown.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
was
a
transcript
problem.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that
was
indiana.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
know
that
all
the
scholars
are
in
agreement
as
to
just
exactly
whether
it
was
equal
protection
or
due
process,
but
one
of
the
two.
lane
versus
brown
involved
a
situation
where
a
public
defender
refused
to
obtain
a
transcript
so
that
mr.
brown,
i
think,
it
was
could
take
his
appeal.
the
transcript
was
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
appeal,
to
the
indiana
supreme
court.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
no,
it
is
not
this
case
exactly.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
a
full
transcript
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
the
full
transcript
was
made
available
by
the
trial
court.
the
iowa
supreme
court
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
they
never
saw
it.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right.
he
had
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
under
the
facts
--
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case,
i
would
still
have
to
comeback
and
say
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
denial
--
that
the
indigent
was
denied
full
and
effective
appellate
review
and
i
suppose
we're
talking
about
either
an
equal
protection
or
due
process
problem
if
it
were
simply
negligence
or
neglect
on
it
behalf
of
the
counsel,
then
i
suppose
we're
talking
about
an
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel
which
is
still
a
due
process
proposition
as
i
understand
it.
frankly,
we
are
now
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
frankly,
i'm
floundering
a
little
bit
because
i
haven't
given
this.
i
tried
to
tie
it
down
to
some
specific
phase.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
say
this
that
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
man,
an
indigent
designed
an
appeal
from
his
conviction
had
the
right
to
full
plenary
review
of
the
proceedings
culminating
in
that
conviction.
now,
this
he
didn't
get.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
except
for
the
neglect
of
his
counsel
apparently
and
to
that
extent,
he
was
denied
due
process.
he
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
given
the
type
of
appeal
to
which
he
wan
entitled
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
oh,
that's
--
that
is
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
a
more
expressly
spelled
out
in
mr.
belin's
brief,
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
do
have
a
mixture
of
both
of
these
things.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
think
any
action
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
supreme
court
itself
deprived
the
man
of
counsel
in
a
meaningful
sense
because
counsel
had
been
appointed
in
the
trial
court
but
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
that's
correct.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
without
any
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
if
--
if
it
were
not
possible
for
the
--
in
this
situation
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
it
were
not
possible
for
the
defendant
to
retain
further
counsel,
the
court
would
see
that
counsel
was
appointed
-
mr.
don
r.
bennett
--
to
represent
him.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
and
this
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
yes,
i
believe
so.
well,
i'd
like
to
--
since
mr.
belin
has
pressed
the
merits
of
the
search
and
seizure
and
self-incrimination
argument,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
few
seconds
to
explain
to
the
court
why
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
don
r.
bennett
alright
i
--
mr.
don
r.
bennett
well,
mr.
belin
thinks
they
are.
he
expressed
them.
apparently,
the
merits
were
pressed
in
douglas
versus
california
as
i
recall
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark
and
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
and
one
of
the
footnotes
indicates
that
they
were
pressing
the
merits
on
this
court
in
douglas
versus
california
and
the
court
didn't
decide
them.
but
i
would
say
this,
you've
got
a
copy
of
the
trial
transcript
up
here
and
you
don't
have
to
read
it
too
carefully
to
find
out
there
is
some
real
difficult
question
on
whether
a
man
consented
to
these
--
to
the
use
of
these
papers
or
whether
within
schmerber
versus
california,
he
hasn't
waived
any
--
waived
any
argument
on
the
merits
of
search
and
seizure
and
self-incrimination
argument
because
of
his
failure
to
raise
timely
objections.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
your
honors.
