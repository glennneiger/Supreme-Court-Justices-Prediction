your
argument.
chief

i
suppose
if
--
if
the
retained
lawyer
took
the
money
and
then
did
nothing
for
him
and
his
counsel,
i
mean,
his
client
had
wanted
him
to
do
so,
he'd
be
subject
to
discipline,
wouldn't
he,
by
the
--
by
the
bar
for
having
neglected
his
professional
duty?
chief

earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl

very
well.
mr.

chief

did
you
not
tell
us
also
that
in
your
opinion
the

the
court
was
responsible
to
some
extent
for
him
not
having
this
appeal
because
the
prisoner
informed
the
court
that
his
counsel
was
not
assisting
him
and
that
in
spite
of
that,
the
court
without
more
decided
the
case
summarily
without
any
review
or
any
investigation
--
chief

--
of
any

that's
the
state
action,
i
assume
that
you
--
chief

--
that
you
would
rely
on
in
coming

a
conclusion
that

he'd
not
have
