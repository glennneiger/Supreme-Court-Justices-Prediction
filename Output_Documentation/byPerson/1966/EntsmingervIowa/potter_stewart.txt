justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
indictment
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
instructions
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
does
the
clerk's
transcript
consist?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
might
be
cases
as
justice
douglas
suggests
where
the
questions
is
one
of
law
and
not
at
all
as
to
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
or
rulings
on
admission
of
evidence
or
anything
but
simply
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
or
the
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
what
the
content
of
the
particular
offense
was
or
--
where
a
clerk's
transcript
would
be
adequate?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
is
no
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
quite
follow
that
because
you
think
that
there
might
be
cases
where
a
perfectly
--
a
perfectly
careful
lawyer
might
have
one
good
solid
point
on
appeal
which
could
be
fully
disclosed
and
exposed
by
a
clerk's
transcript
and
therefore
he
wouldn't
bother
asking
for
anything
else
and
then
he'd
go
and
argue
his
case
and
probably
win
it
if
let's
say
there
were
instructions
and
violation
of
griffin
against
california.
now
what
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
without
any
--
without
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
argument?
or
without
any
briefing,
i
guess.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no
briefing
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
sort
of
an
abandonment
without
an
appeal,
wasn't
that
what
it
amounts
to
but
--
but
the
device
it
does
give
the
appellant
a
little
more
time
out
of
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
appointed
counsel
compensated
in
your
--
in
iowa?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
bit
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
they're
under
this
clerk's
transcript
system,
every
lawyer
paid
for
doing
nothing
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
the
ultimate
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
which
cutoff
this
man's
right
to
a
meaningful
appeal.
that
is
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
deprived
the
man
to
the
help
of
counsel
in
arguing
an
appeal
or
in
briefing
an
appeal,
or
in
sync
to
it,
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
had
a
full
record
before
it
and
that
ultimately
was
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
that
resulted
in
the
--
in
those
deprivals,
isn't
that
right
or
deprivations,
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
they
–
and
they
knew
that
and
they
knew
that
the
man
wanted
a
plenary
review
and
argument
of
the
full
record
and
knowing
that
and
i'm
not
describing
or
attributing
any
fault,
but
is
the
way
it
worked.
this
was
all
before
the
court
and
with
that
all
before
the
court,
the
court
decided
his
case
on
this
clerk's
record
without
any
argument
or
without
any
briefing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereby,
deprived
him
of
the
other
meaningful
appeal
on
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
that
state
actions,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
equal
protection
doesn't
relate
exclusively
to
wealth
and
poverty
and
has
a
broader
coverage
that
that,
doesn't
it
as
mr.
justice
fortas
suggests?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
looking
at
--
through
the
statement
of
--
the
statement
of
facts
in
your
brief
and
i
thought
i'd
seen
that
--
that
mr.
enstminger
himself
had
written
to
the
supreme
court,
well,
i
don't
see
that.
i
don't
find
--
justice
potter
stewart
27
of
the
record
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
this
--
and
this
was
dated
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
dated
--
it's
dated
october
8th,
1965?
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
that
fall
in
the
chronology?
justice
potter
stewart
about
10
days
after?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the

of
