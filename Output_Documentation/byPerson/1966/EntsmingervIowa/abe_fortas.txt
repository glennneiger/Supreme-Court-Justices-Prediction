justice
abe
fortas
isn't
the
counsel,
doesn't
the
attorney
general
pretty
much
concede
this
part
of
your
case?
justice
abe
fortas
now
on
page,
for
example,
on
page
28
of
his
brief,
as
well
as
elsewhere,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
suggests
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
the
case
remanded
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
because
of
the
inaction
of
court-appointed
counsel
and
have
the
case
remanded
for
carrying
the
appeal
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
where
does
that
leave
us?
justice
abe
fortas
sufficient
what?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
real
question,
the
question
then
the
only
remaining
question
that
i
see
as
subject
here
enlightened
--
enlightening
me
is
whether
we
ought
to
reach
the
search
and
seizure
question?
justice
abe
fortas
or
whether
we
just
ought
to
remand
as
the
attorney
general
if
i
correctly
understand
his
brief
suggests
that
iowa
supreme
court
for
the
consideration
of
the
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
am
i
--
am
i
right
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
may
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
but
my
reading
of
the
--
my
recollection
of
the
attorney
general's
brief
is
that
at
least
state
is
agreeable
having
this
case
remanded
to
the
iowa
courts
for
consideration
of
the
appeal
on
the
basis
of
a
complete
record
and
with
the
newly
appointed
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
if
that
so,
i
don't
see
what
we've
got
left
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
your
point
here
as
i
understand
it
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
court-appointed
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
that
the
counsel
didn't
do
his
job
that
the
petitioner
called
that
fact
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
court
ignored
that
and
went
ahead
and
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
clerk's
transcript
and
that
this
amounts
to
a
denial
of
the
right
of
appeal.
am
i
right
in
this
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
actually
this
may
not
raise
a
problem
of
a
distinction
between
situation
in
which
there's
appointed
counsel
and
the
situation
which
there's
a
retained
counsel,
because
i
assume
that
if
something
of
the
same
sort
had
happened
and
a
defendant
had
--
an
appellant
had
told
that
iowa's
supreme
court
that
he
had
retained
the
counsel,
but
that
for
some
reason,
retained
counsel
was
not
prosecuting
his
appeal.
the
iowa
supreme
court
would
take
whatever
action
was
appropriate
in
the
circumstances
to
see
that
the
man's
appeal
was
not
defeated?
justice
abe
fortas
good
point.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
