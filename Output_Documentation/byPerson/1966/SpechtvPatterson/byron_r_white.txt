of
the
matter,
you're
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
send
him
there
while
they're
making
the
examination,
don't
they?
justice
byron

white
well,
where
did
they
send
them
while
they're
making
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
if
it
is
only
a
sentencing
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
is
incomparable
situations
where
sentence
might
be
enhanced
to
--
based
on
some
ancillary
finding
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
characteristically
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
the
counsel
of
that
hearing?
i
mean,
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
him
being
a
habitual
criminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
normally
across
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
must
be
found
and
it
must
be
found
and
by
the
--
expressly
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
judge,
may
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
a
direct
appeal
on
colorado,
is
this
subject
to
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
determination
of
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
this
factual
--
of
this
facts,
which
put
him
in
a
different
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
mean
that
--
isn't
--
doesn't
--
he
has
to
have
had
the
examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
report
says
one
thing,
the
judge
decides
it
to
reverse?
the
court
says
he
is
not
dangerous.
and
the
judge
says,
the
psychiatrist
doesn't
know
what
he's
talking
about
but
i
do.
he
is
a
danger
to
the
community
and
makes
the
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
mr.
bush,
what
kind
of
the
hearing
do
you
have
in
colorado
when
the
person
has
not
been
convicted
at
the
time
that
someone
wants
to
put
him
in
an
institution.
do
you
have
some
kind
of
a
due
process
hearing
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
any
kind
of
commitment
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
shouldn't
we
look
at
this
case
as
a
--
just
enough
for
the
state
to
commit
a
person
and
wholly
divorce
it
from
the
prior
criminal
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
committing
him
for
this
particular
reason
because
he
is
a
danger
to
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
commit
him
for
this
period
or
under
these
circumstances.
that
if
only
you
had
done
and
all
you
had
found
and
all
those
stated
found
was
that
he
committed
this
particular
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
(inaudible)
proceed
to
find
another
fact
and
they
based
their
commitment
on
other
considerations
before
you
may
put
him
in
the
hands
of
--
of
the
--
well,
before
you
could
commit
him
for
this
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
five
and
a
minimum
maximum
of
five
and
one
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
colorado
appellate
courts
have
found
or
advise
sentences?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
widespread
the
sex
psychopaths
that
you
just
mentioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
it
was
sex
psychopath
law
or
your
type
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
under
42
(a)
08,
you
can
only
--
all
you
can
do
is
to
keep,
is
to
sentence
him
to
a
term
within
the
maximum
prescribed
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
and
the
--
they
have
--
the
scheme
is
to
sentence
him
to
the
maximum
then
you
get
him
examined,
you
bring
him
back
and
you
perhaps
reduce
the
sentence
or
you
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he's
--
but
--
and
then
he's
simply
committed
to
the
attorney
general
whether
who
has
a
choice
of
setting
him
the
one
kind
of
a
--
an
institution
or
another.
justice
byron

but
still
is
within
the
limits
of
this

of
the
penalty
prescribed
by
the

byron

i
thought
we
were
told
that
third
circuit
said
that
it
was
applied
under
that
statute.
i
thought

and
so
i
misunderstood
that.
justice
byron

oh!
i
see.
what's
the
third
circuit

is
the
third
circuit
a
constitutional
or
