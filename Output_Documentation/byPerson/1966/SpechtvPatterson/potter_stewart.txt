justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
misunderstood
then.
first
of
all,
it
has
to
be
a
conviction
of
one
of
the
speci
--enumerated
specified
offenses
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
were
all
some
kind
of
sex
offense
that
vary.
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
trial
judge
has
discretion.
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
--
he
could
in
this
case
and
he
can
under
the
laws
if
we
go
ahead
and
sentence
him
to
whatever
sentence
the
law
says
shall
be
--
may
be
imposed
for
each
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
each
specified
offenses.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
he'd
--
and
he
has
the
discretion
do
that.
but
otherwise,
he
doesn't
want
to
do
that,
what
does
he
do?
does
he
then
have
the
man
examined
by
a
psychiatrist?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
and
then
--
so
this
--
before
he
can
sentence
the
man
under
this
act,
he
has
to
have
that
kind
of
a
psychiatric
report?
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
the
other
hand,
even
after
getting
that
kind
of
report,
he
can
decide
to
sentence
him
under
the
original
criminal
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
the
facts
so
clear
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
was
it
found
that
he
--
which
was
it
found,
that
he
was
--constituted
as
threat
or
bodily
harm
to
the
members
of
the
public
or
that
he
was
a
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
strikes
makes
me
about
this
case
is
something
which
i
suppose
--
which
i
understand
you
haven't
raised
in
your
certiorari
petition
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
sentencing
a
person
to
the
colorado
state
penitentiary
because
that
vary
your
sentence
under
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
--
on
a
finding
that
he's
mentally
ill?
justice
potter
stewart
for
mental
illness?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
--
the
court
is
required
to
send
him
initially
at
least
to
the
colorado
state
penitentiary,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
reading
the
top
of
page
29.
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
examination?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
in
canyon
city?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
federal
rules
of
the
--
kind
of
procedure
permit
does
that,
the
ones
recently
authorized
by
this
court,
can't
they?
if
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
sentencing
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
the
federal
rules
authorize
the
district
--
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
federal
system
to
keep
the
information
contained
in
the
pre-sentence
investigation
for
himself
that
he
wishes
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
his
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
rules
recently
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
approves
and
its
promulgated
by
this
court
and
by
the
congress
last
summer?
justice
potter
stewart
with
some
comments
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
from
the
plaintiff's
view.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bush,
general
bush,
upon
conviction
of
--
upon
the
charge
here
of
--
what
was
it
indecent
liberties?
justice
potter
stewart
the
judge,
absent
this
colorado
sex
offender
sentencing
act,
could
have,
in
his
discretion,
sentence
the
petitioner
to
anything
up
to
10
years.
justice
potter
stewart
could
he
have
under
colorado
law
impose
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
one
to
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
in
the
sentence
of
the
court,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
a
fix
term
of
five
years
for
instance?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
i'm
familiar
with
that
in
ohio
and
i'm
asking
you
here.
what
--
absent
this
sex
offenders
act?
what
would
--
what
could
the
sentence
and
what
normally
would
the
sentence
of
the
court
have
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
could
have
been
five
years
period?
justice
potter
stewart
the
sentencing
judge
is
required
to
set
a
minimum
and
maximum
within
the
one
to
ten
years
back
spectrum.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
statutory
spectrum?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
issues,
of
course,
upon
the
--
and
which
were
decided
in
the
matter
he's
convicted
was
whether
he
did
it
and
did
he
have
any
validly
the
defenses.
and
that's
the
result
against
him.
and
that
would
have
been
empowered
the
judge
to
impose
a
sentence
you
referred
to.
justice
potter
stewart
which
the
minimum
of
one
day
and
a
maximum
of
its
natural
life.
and
as
i
understand,
that
sentence,
it
is
not
--
the
judge
does
not
have
discretion
within
the
spectrum
imposed
by
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
it?
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
he
couldn't
have
under
the
sex
offenders
act
said.
“i
am
sentencing
you
to
a
sentence
of
--
from
one,
one
to
twelve
years.”
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
order
for
us
to
sentence
him
at
all
under
the
sex
offenders
act,
he
had
to
make
additional
factual
findings
that
is
additional
to
what
was
necessary
to
be
found
to
support
his
guilt
on
the
indecent
liberties
charge.
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
this
i
don't
want
to
worry
this
no
respondent
that
--
but
if
the
court
does
in
its
discretion
decide
to
proceed
under
the
sex
offenders
act.
it
is
mandatory
upon
the
court,
and
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
to
impose
a
sentence
of
a
minimum
of
one
day
and
a
maximum
of
his
natural
life.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
does
the
latter,
the
third
alternative,
what
may
or
must
his
sentence
be?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
does
choose
the
third
alternative,
he
has
no
discretion
as
to
what
sentence
to
impose?
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me,
are
there
any
other
sexes
psychopath
to
which,
this
procedure
applies
that
carry
less
if
the
alternative
is
adopted
and
the
maximum
of
10
years
involved
here?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
does
this
carry?
now
i
thought
this
was
10
years?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
applies
maximum
is
below
as
maximum
anyway,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
misunderstood

yes.
