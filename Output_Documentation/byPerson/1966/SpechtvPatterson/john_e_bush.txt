mr.
john
e.
bush
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
colorado
sentencing
of
sex
offenders
act
is
a
statute
which
provides
solely
and
simply
for
imposition
of
an
indeterminate
sentence.
it
is
our
position
that
this
indeterminate
sentence
stands
on
the
same
basis
as
any
other
indeterminate
sentence,
a
matter
which
has
become
common
place,
a
common
place
practice
throughout
the
country,
in
particular
the
federal
system.
the
indeterminate
sentence
provided
is
one
which
we
consider
to
be
responsive
to
the
--
in
liking
the
approach
to
sentencing.
we
can
compare
this
form
of
sentence
with
the
older
form
of
sentence
and
find
that
this
is
a
sentence
which
rejects
the
concept
of
punishment
and
retribution
and
substitutes
in
its
place
that
control
and
discipline.
it's
a
plan's
rigidity
with
flexibility.
the
discretionary
decision
to
impose
the
sentence
under
the
sex
offender
act
is
measured
by
specific
standard
set
forth
in
the
act
which
is
in
contrast
to
the
orthodox
colorado
sentence
where
the
fixing
of
the
indeterminate
sentence
is
within
the
plenary
control
of
complainery
--
discretionary
control
of
the
trial
court.
we
therefore
offer
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
mr.
justice
white,
are
you
referring
to
the
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
a
civil
commitment
for
insanity
to
the
mental
health
statutes?
there
would
be.
yes,
your
honor,
a
hearing.
it
is
generally
--
the
general
procedure
is
defined
by
commission
and
then
within
five
days,
a
request
for
jury
trial
for
person
deals/agree
by
the
client.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
must
make
immediately
the
distinction.
we
are
not
committing
a
defendant
for
their
mental
state
of
mind.
we
are
committing
a
man
because
of
the
commission
of
a
crime.
he
has
been
tried
and
convicted
of
the
commission
of
an
overt
act
which
has
been
defined
as
a
crime.
mr.
john
e.
bush
we
are
determining,
your
honor,
the
nature
of
the
sentence
based
upon
his
past
record
and
his
behavioral
characteristics
which
are
the
standard
guides
for
determining
sentence.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
have
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
suggest,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
sounder
approach.
then
the
ordinary
indeterminate
sentence
which
permits
the
trial
court
to
fix
the
indeterminate
sentence
without
standards
and
classifications
and
this
is
in
response
to
what
most
responsible
psychiatrist,
penologist,
criminologist
are
asking
for
and
that
is
the
determination
--
that
the
determination
of
whether
a
lesser
or
greater
sentence
be
imposed
under
the
indeterminate
sentence
have
classifications
and
standards
set
forth.
mr.
john
e.
bush
indecent
liberties.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor,
as
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
the
sentence
provided
in
the
indecent
liberty
law
is
an
indeterminate
sentence.
most
all
of
ours
are
the
indeterminate
type
sentence.
it
is
a
minimum
of
no
less
than
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
no
more
than
10
years.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
bush
oh!
we
must
have
a
minimum
--
maximum
in
all
sentences
except
life.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
say
because
it
would
have
been
discretionary
decision.
it
could
have
been
one
year
--
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
maximum
of
10.
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
nine
and
a
half
and
a
maximum
of
10.
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
one
and
the
maximum
of
one
and
a
half.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
sir.
no,
it
could
not.
you
have
to
have
a
minimum,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
five.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor,
any
combination.
mr.
john
e.
bush
that's
correct.
within
the
limits
of
the
minimum,
maximum
specified.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
but,
your
honor,
let's
go
back
if
i
may
please.
at
the
time
the
man
committed
the
over
react
which
gave
rise
to
the
charge
of
which
he
was
convicted,
there
wasn't
one
permissible
sentence.
there
were
two
permissible
sentences.
two
alternative
sentences.
one
being
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
ten
years
and
the
other
being
the
sentence
provided
under
the
sex
offenders
law.
mr.
john
e.
bush
that's
correct.
mr.
john
e.
bush
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
precisely.
mr.
john
e.
bush
precisely.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct.
you
are
correct.
this
--
we
say,
is
the
same
process
that
any
courts
goes
through
in
determining
sentence
whether
facts
and
circumstances
as
related
to
ones
past
record
as
related
to
ones
behavioral
characteristics
justify
the
imposition
of
either
a
lesser
or
greater
sentence.
otherwise,
we
would
say
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
would
be
capricious.
the
--
this
is
the
--
it
has
the
same
legal
operative
effect.
it's
the
federal
sentencing
statute,
18
u.s.c.
4208.
mr.
john
e.
bush
they
do
not,
your
honor.
one
other
additional
benefit
which
accrues
under
this
type
of
sentence
is
that
referred
to
by
opposing
counsel
and
this
we
submit
is
a
decision.
the
decision
imposed
sentence
is
one
which
is
reviewable
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
sense
of
any
fact
finding
process
or
decision-making
process,
discretionary
of
the
trial
court.
whereas,
other
sentences,
the
classic
sentence
or
the
orthodox
sentence
in
colorado
is
not
reviewable.
and
is
--
the
court
well
knows
this
controversy
is
now
going
on
the
federal
system
as
to
whether
they
should
or
should
not.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
he
commences
the
proceedings.
the
examination
is
conducted
and
it
is
principally
at
the
colorado
psychopathic
hospital
in
denver,
to
the
medical
school
but
the
court
can
commit
him
any
other
place
or
private
psychiatric
institution
or
any
place
else.
pre-sentence
report
is
prepared
in
the
meantime
by
the
probation
department.
both
reports
are
filed
in
the
court.
hearing
is
set
for
imposition
of
sentencing
and
at
that
point
in
time,
the
court
has
three
alternatives
to
sentence
him
under
the
--
which
is
40
days,
2
days,
30
--
to
the
indecent
liberty
statute,
grant
probation
or
sentence
him
under
the
act
of
sentencing
those
sex
offenders.
mr.
john
e.
bush
his
sentence
must
be
one
day,
a
minimum
of
one
day
and
a
maximum
of
one
life.
or
excuse
me,
two
half
life.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
sentence
speaks
by
statute.
the
question
in
our
judgment
presented
is,
does
a
sentencing
statute
re
--
which
responds
to
the
enlighten
approach
to
sentencing
of
undue
process?
in
resolving
this
question,
petitioner
assumes
the
stance
that
most
of
the
critics
of
this
form
of
statute
or
of
the
other
form,
which
is
normally
called
the
sex
psychopath
statute,
assume
and
we
think
that
the
fundamental
error
of
approach
of
this
--
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
that
he
confused
on
statutory
scheme
with
the
statutory
scheme
provided
by
the
statutes
which
are
commonly
known
as
the
“sex
psychopath
laws”.
the
sex
psychopath
laws,
however,
are
civil
commitment
proceedings.
they
are
not
sentencing
statutes.
these
statutes
provides
for
the
basis
for
commitment.
under
the
colorado
law,
the
conviction
provides
the
basis
for
commitment.
very
obviously,
in
the
petitioner's
case,
the
panoply
of
civil
rights
--
of
due
process
rights,
attached
to
his
trial.
we
submit
that
upon
conviction,
he
has
then
subject
to
whatever
sentence
the
legislature
has
in
its
discretion
determined.
referring
to
the
statutes
which
are
generally
talked
about
as
sex
psychopath
laws,
one
is
a
civil
commitment
proceeding
similar
to
the
type
considered
by
the
court
in
minnesota
ex-rail
pearson
versus
probate
court.
the
basic
scheme
there
provided
is
that
a
petition
is
filed
and
the
petition
is
usually
based
upon
the
allegation
of
a
criminal
charge.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
these
proceedings,
no
requirement
has
ever
made
that
that
charged
be
ever
established.
yet,
this
can
form
a
basis
for
a
man's
commitment.
the
second
is
a
civil
commitment
procedure
which
operates
ancillary
to
a
criminal
case.
this
letter
form
takes
two
shapes.
one
is
set
in
motion
by
a
petition
prior
to
conviction;
the
other
permits
the
filing
of
a
petition
to
commit
after
conviction.
some
provide
that
if
commit
--
civil
commitment
is
ordered,
the
criminal
charges
are
dismissed.
however,
the
majority
of
states
provide
that
when
recovery
is
affected,
the
defendant
is
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
either
trial
or
execution
of
his
sentence,
a
procedure,
which
in
our
judgment
is,
could
be
said
and
has
been
said
by
some
to
be
self-defeating.
in
any
event,
this
discussion
in
our
judgment
serves
to
show
--
to
establish
only
one
thing
and
that
is
what
procedure
or
what
scheme
the
state
adopts
is
a
matter
of
wisdom
of
policy,
one
which
should
be
addressed
properly
to
the
state
legislature.
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
this
volume
which
i
did
not
cite,
and
i
apologize
for
not
citing,
by
the
american
bar
foundation.
they
mainly
disabled
law.
i
did
not
find
in
the
law
library.
i
found
it
in
a
medical
school
after
--
library
after
i
had
filed
my
brief.
but
it
seems
to
have
the
best
summation
of
the
sex
psychopath
laws
throughout
the
country.
they
say,
and
this
was
published
in
1961,
that
there
are
27
states
which
have
one
form
or
another
and
they
set
forth
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
our
type
of
law.
mr.
john
e.
bush
in
looking
at
the
chart,
it
appears
there
are
four
utah,
oregon,
colorado,
and
pennsylvania.
and
then
michigan
has
as
counsel
mentioned
one
similar
to
ours
except
that
the
longest
period
that
it
can
be
held
is
limited
by
the
maximum
allowable.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
the
mentally
disabled
in
the
law
by
mr.
lindman
and
mcentire,
the
american
bar
foundation.
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
it
could
work
that
way
starting
from
a
different
point.
the
initial
--
under
the
statute,
the
initial
place
of
commitment
is
the
state
penitentiary,
the
parole
board
then
is
charged
with
the
duty
to
transfer
or
retransfer
between
any
of
the
state
or
institution
based
upon
the
need
for
treatment,
rehabilitation
and
control
which
gives
rise
to
another
very
good
point.
and
that
is,
that
this
statute
permits
the
full
range
of
state
facilities
to
be
available
to
this
individual
if
it
is
a
program
necessary
simply
a
vocational
training
in
order
to
increase
the
one's
maturation
as
some
psychiatrist
say
it's
the
most
pro
--
it
is
the
problem
in
many
of
the
cases
of
sex
offender
--
purely
and
simply
lack
of
maturation.
and,
vocational
training
will
suffice
as
the
necessary
rehabilitation
then
the
man
may
be
transferred
to
the
state
reformatory
and
undertake
a
vocational
training
program.
so
it
can
be
looked
out
mountain
golden
gate,
the
state
penitentiary,
the
state
hospital,
the
state
reformatory.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
it
is
potentially
possible.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
that
i
think
assumes
the
validity
of
their
position
that
you
have
two
sentence
or
two
different
separate
sections
which
have
some
legal
significance.
mr.
john
e.
bush
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
then
that
is
not
the
sentence
--
only
sentence
that
he
is
subjected
to
at
the
time
he
commits
the
act.
this
act
was
in
enforced
and
effect
at
the
time
that
he
committed
that
act.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
was
subject
to
two
sentences.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
it's
the
same
process
by
which
any
sentence
is
imposed.
it's
the
same
process
that
a
federal
judge
goes
through
in
imposing
sentence
under
1842
(a)
08.
unless
you
say
that
a
judge
imposes
a
lesser
or
a
greater
sentences
or
sentence
unrelated
to
any
facts
and
circumstances
and
it
is
a
capricious
act
of
sentencing.
mr.
john
e.
bush
no
longer
than
a
maximum.
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
alright,
then
let's
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
in
the
concept
of
enhanced
penalty,
your
honor,
i
submit
is
nothing
noble
in
the
concept
to
the
law.
it
is
no
different
then
the
situation
that
are
--
that
this
court
considered
in
wanes
versus
oklahoma
where
the
decision
based
by
the
court
was
life
or
death
and
the
court
in
that
case
chose
death.
and
there
certainly
is
no
more
critical
decision
to
a
defendant
than
the
choice
of
death.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
at
no
time,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
is
not
in
the
colorado
courts.
no
and
he
is
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
well,
he
has
exhausted
those
memories
or
remedies.
excuse
me.
there's
no
question
here
of
failure
to
exhaust
state
remedies
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
has
been
to
the
colorado
supreme
court
twice.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
has
no
absolute
right,
no.
and
he
does
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
the
parole
board.
but
if
the
parole
board
would
determine
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
the
mental
health
laws
do,
your
honor,
and
likewise
the
criminal
insanity
laws
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
we
would
submit
that
the
only
remedy
it
would
have
would
be
matter
of
certiorari
to
review
the
discretionary
decision
of
the
parole
board
in
denying
his
release
and
subsequent
discharge.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
the
one
cited
here,
your
honor.
number
1,
indecent
liberties
carries
less
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
one
--
oh,
you
mean
that
are
--
excuse
me,
i've
misunderstood
the
question.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
under
40
days,
2
days,
34
would
be
a
minimum
of
one
and
maximum
of
5.
the
only
one
that
is
in
excess
of
the
one
provided
is
first
degree
rape,
which
is
a
minimum
of
3
and
a
maximum
of
life.
the
others
listed,
incest
is
a
maximum
of
20
years.
i
think
they're
all
these.
mr.
john
e.
bush
offhand,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
john
e.
bush
i'm
just
looking
at
my
notes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
the
hearings
are
provided,
your
honor,
under
all
of
the
states
that
have.
what
i
--
what
i
discussed
to
as
the
sex
psychopath
type
statute.
these
were
all
civil
commitment
statues
and
they
operate
the
same
manner
as
most
of
the
mental
health
statutes.
mr.
john
e.
bush
to
my
knowledge,
they
do
not.
and,
i'm
referring
to
the
american
bar
foundation.
i
know
the
pennsylvania
law
does
not
and
i
am
confident
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
yes
this
i
would
have
thought
just
myself
to
what
statute
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
it's
a
consti
--
yes,
i
think
--
since
my
time
is
fleeing,
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
--
clear
up
one
point.
we
have
always
addressed
ourselves
to
a
question
of
substantive
due
process.
is
the
statute
valid
on
its
face
unless
it,
by
words
and
phrases,
explicitly
require
a
second
trial?
now
this
has
been
the
question
that
has
been
addressed
to
the
court.
now,
apparently
petitioner
is
benevolent
in
his
attitude.
first,
we
went
to
the
benefit
of
the
pennsylvania
court
which
is
a
procedural
due
process
question
purely
and
simply.
and
then,
we
end
up
in
our
reply
brief
saying
that
all
that
is
required
is
substantial
justice.
well,
we
have
never
denied
the
sense
of
substantial
justice
should
not
be
afforded.
we
should
never
deny
the
due
process,
should
not
afforded.
we
think
due
process
should
be
afforded
in
each
and
every
stage
of
the
proceedings.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
shape
and
form
of
due
process
which
attaches
to
sentencing.
i
think
the
court
very
clearly
said
what
that
is
in
townson
versus
berg
and
that
is
a
question
of
fair
play.
the
same
questions
here
addressed
to
the
court,
we
think,
were
disposed
of
in
wanes
versus
new
york
and
wanes
versus
oklahoma.
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
draws
a
very
insubstantial
distinction
to
justify
its
finding
or
its
determination
that
this
is
a
separate
trial.
and
of
course,
the
court
does
not
tell
us
what
is
the
quantity
or
quality
or
shape
performed
of
due
process
which
attaches
to
the
second
trial.
so
it's
difficult
for
us
to
respond
to
it.
in
any
event,
the
court
drew
the
analogy,
the
principal
premise
and
their
--
so
logistic
approach
was
that
they
drew
analogy
between
this
law
and
the
habitual
criminal
law
and
relied
on
these
court's
decisions
in
oyler
and
fretag,
chandler
versus
fretag.
we
say
number
one,
the
third
circuit
misinterpreted
the
holdings
in
those
two
decisions.
i
think
the
only
question
addressed
to
the
court
in
both
of
those
decisions
was
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel.
and
the
oyler
case
that
went
on
that
he
was
also
entitled
to
reasonable
notice
which
we
would
think
would
be
obvious
under
any
sentencing
hearing
in
order
to
have
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
very
obviously,
he
must
have
a
reasonable
notice
of
the
hearing.
going
to
the
procedurals,
the
third
point,
in
any
event
as
to
habitual
criminal
act,
why
do
we
say
that
it
is
not
analogous?
we
say
that
we
would
like
to
be
unshackled
from
the
habitual
criminal
law.
this,
the
habitual
criminal
law
has
one
purpose
in
mind
and
that
is
punishment
alone.
we
submit
that
it
represents
the
past.
we
have
tried
to
reject
the
habitual
criminal
law.
it
has
essentially
become
functus
oficio
in
colorado
and
we
have
gone
almost
entirely
to
the
indeterminate
type
sentence.
so
if
we're
bound
by,
as
the
third
circuit
says
the
habitual
criminal
law,
then
we
will
be
mired
so
to
speak
in
the
past
and
will
be
unable
to
progress
to
the
future.
the
other
is,
there's
a
finding
of
fact
and
we
say
this
is
unsubstantial/insubstantial.
if
this
is
true,
colorado
can
overcome
that
point
by
the
simple
device
of
eliminating
the
statute.
well,
it's
a
separate
statutory
section.
well,
we
can
eliminate
that
objection
too
by
a
simple
device
of
amending
the
indecent
liberty
statute
and
adding
thereto
most
of
our
statute,
statute
providing
or
i
won't
say
most
but
many
of
our
statutes
providing
for
sentencing
or
in
separate
sections.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
question
is
what
occurred
at
this
hearing
for
imposition
of
sentence
is
not
before
this
court.
there
is
no
official
record
of
this
kind.
it
has
never
been
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
that's
a
generic
word,
your
honor.
and
what
type
of
hearing
that
we
are
talking
about?
in
the
classic
--
oh,
i'm
discussing
now
on
the
classic
sentence
of
a
hearing
to
impose
sentence,
which
very
obviously
he
is
entitled
to
counsel.
he
is
entitled
to
notice.
very
obviously,
he
has
notice
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings.
ordinarily,
he
is
entitled
to
the
information
upon
which
sentencing
will
be
imposed.
colorado
has
never
denied
that
this
information
should
be
withheld
from
the
defendant.
and
in
practice,
it
is
uniformly
done
throughout
the
state.
we
submit
to
the
court
of
the
--
excuse
me.
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
review
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
would
be
the
soundness
of
the
trial
courts
discretionary
decision
in
imposing
the
sex
offender
stat
--
or
excuse
me,
sentence.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
of
the
record
as
disclosed.
the
pre-sentence
report?
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
it
is
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
clear
that
up.
it
is
not
necessarily
an
ex
parte
record
of
the
probation
report.
the
pre-sentence
report
is
designed
to
serve
the
purpose
of
the
defendant
and
most
defendants
are
satisfied
with
it.
now
if
the
unusual
circumstances
arise
where
he
wishes
to
correct
or
add
to
it,
most
courts
will
permit
that.
so
it
is
not
necess--
it
is
not
an
ex
parte
in
that
sense.
firstly,
ordinarily,
he
has
knowledge
of
all
the
information
contained
in
that
pre-sentence
report.
he
makes
known
to
the
probation
department
what
information
he
wishes
to
have
here.
it's
the
normal
probation
process.
the
probation
department
interviews
his
family,
his
employer
and
so
forth
and
ordinarily,
all
of
the
information
that
he
could
have
--
could
cared
to
have
in
--
have
before
is
contained
in
here
the
very
limited
circumstances
he
is
dissatisfied.
this
i
cannot
represent
that
it
is
dissatisfied
that
he
would
be
guaranteed
the
right
to
subpoena
witnesses
to
correct.
it
is
normal.
he
would
normally
do
that.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
the
normal
practice.
it
is
not
by
specific
rule.
in
denver,
where
about
40%
of
the
criminal
cases
arise
at
the
state
of
colorado,
it's
been
in
that
practice
for
as
long
as
the
man
can
remember.
there
have
been
during
practices
in
some
counties,
smaller
counties,
by
verbal
directive
of
the
chief
--
of
then
chief
justice
two
years
ago,
they
were
directed
as
to
all
counties
that
they
be
made
available.
so
it
is
essentially
in
practice
the
same
as
the
court
rule
32.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
we
must
take,
your
honor,
the
allegation
of
the
petitioner
as
true
since
it
was
dismissed
on
its
face
by
the
trial
court,
by
judge
ray
and
affirmed
on
that
basis
by
the
tenth
circuit.
his
allegation
in
the
complaint,
your
honor,
is
that
the
psychiatrist
report
was
made
available
to
his
counsel
but
he
did
not
see
it.
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
it
was
not
explicit
in
our
rules
and
as
i
say,
the
custom
in
practice
is
that
he
--
this
report
be
made
available
to
defendant's
defense
counsel.
mr.
john
e.
bush
to
the
best,
i
have
consulted
with
trial
judge
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
record.
the
best
of
his
recollection,
he
made
this
available
to
counsel
with
the
stipulation
that
the
conclusions
in
the
report
not
be
made
known
to
the
defendant
for
his
own
benefit.
it
was
not
a
question
of
disclosing
or
keeping
confidential
the
facts
upon
which
these
doctors
conclusion
rested.
and
if
the
counsel
was
free
to
make
use
to
that
report
and
the
facts
contained
therein
insofar
as
he
saw
fit
to
interrogate
the
defendant
if
this
is
true
and
so
forth,
was
this
done
and
on
and
could
have
tested
in
any
manner
the
informational
process
to
see
if
it
was
designed
to
elicit
the
truth
as
that
principles
expressed
in
the
townson
case.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well
this,
your
honor,
i
would
say
a
matter
of
discretion
in
the
trial
court.
i
would
submit
that
the
townson
versus
berg
decision
is
binding
on
the
states
and
that
it
must
be
a
process
which
is
designed
to
elicit
the
truth
and
if
there
are
sound
basis
upon
which
that
informational
process
should
be
corrected
or
supplemented,
then
in
my
judgment
be
abuse
it'd
discretion
to
be
denied
this
type
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
again,
it's
a
qualified
right.
we
use
--
the
defendant
would
have
to
show
a
substantial
basis
for
and
not
just
waste
the
court's
time.
mr.
john
e.
bush
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
colorado
sentencing
of
sex
offenders
act
is
a
statute
which
provides
solely
and
simply
for
imposition
of
an
indeterminate
sentence.
it
is
our
position
that
this
indeterminate
sentence
stands
on
the
same
basis
as
any
other
indeterminate
sentence,
a
matter
which
has
become
common
place,
a
common
place
practice
throughout
the
country,
in
particular
the
federal
system.
the
indeterminate
sentence
provided
is
one
which
we
consider
to
be
responsive
to
the
--
in
liking
the
approach
to
sentencing.
we
can
compare
this
form
of
sentence
with
the
older
form
of
sentence
and
find
that
this
is
a
sentence
which
rejects
the
concept
of
punishment
and
retribution
and
substitutes
in
its
place
that
control
and
discipline.
it's
a
plan's
rigidity
with
flexibility.
the
discretionary
decision
to
impose
the
sentence
under
the
sex
offender
act
is
measured
by
specific
standard
set
forth
in
the
act
which
is
in
contrast
to
the
orthodox
colorado
sentence
where
the
fixing
of
the
indeterminate
sentence
is
within
the
plenary
control
of
complainery
--
discretionary
control
of
the
trial
court.
we
therefore
offer
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
mr.
justice
white,
are
you
referring
to
the
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
a
civil
commitment
for
insanity
to
the
mental
health
statutes?
there
would
be.
yes,
your
honor,
a
hearing.
it
is
generally
--
the
general
procedure
is
defined
by
commission
and
then
within
five
days,
a
request
for
jury
trial
for
person
deals/agree
by
the
client.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
must
make
immediately
the
distinction.
we
are
not
committing
a
defendant
for
their
mental
state
of
mind.
we
are
committing
a
man
because
of
the
commission
of
a
crime.
he
has
been
tried
and
convicted
of
the
commission
of
an
overt
act
which
has
been
defined
as
a
crime.
mr.
john
e.
bush
we
are
determining,
your
honor,
the
nature
of
the
sentence
based
upon
his
past
record
and
his
behavioral
characteristics
which
are
the
standard
guides
for
determining
sentence.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
have
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
suggest,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
sounder
approach.
then
the
ordinary
indeterminate
sentence
which
permits
the
trial
court
to
fix
the
indeterminate
sentence
without
standards
and
classifications
and
this
is
in
response
to
what
most
responsible
psychiatrist,
penologist,
criminologist
are
asking
for
and
that
is
the
determination
--
that
the
determination
of
whether
a
lesser
or
greater
sentence
be
imposed
under
the
indeterminate
sentence
have
classifications
and
standards
set
forth.
mr.
john
e.
bush
indecent
liberties.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor,
as
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
the
sentence
provided
in
the
indecent
liberty
law
is
an
indeterminate
sentence.
most
all
of
ours
are
the
indeterminate
type
sentence.
it
is
a
minimum
of
no
less
than
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
no
more
than
10
years.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
bush
oh!
we
must
have
a
minimum
--
maximum
in
all
sentences
except
life.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
say
because
it
would
have
been
discretionary
decision.
it
could
have
been
one
year
--
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
maximum
of
10.
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
nine
and
a
half
and
a
maximum
of
10.
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
one
and
the
maximum
of
one
and
a
half.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
sir.
no,
it
could
not.
you
have
to
have
a
minimum,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
five.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor,
any
combination.
mr.
john
e.
bush
that's
correct.
within
the
limits
of
the
minimum,
maximum
specified.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
but,
your
honor,
let's
go
back
if
i
may
please.
at
the
time
the
man
committed
the
over
react
which
gave
rise
to
the
charge
of
which
he
was
convicted,
there
wasn't
one
permissible
sentence.
there
were
two
permissible
sentences.
two
alternative
sentences.
one
being
a
minimum
of
one
year
and
a
maximum
of
ten
years
and
the
other
being
the
sentence
provided
under
the
sex
offenders
law.
mr.
john
e.
bush
that's
correct.
mr.
john
e.
bush
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
precisely.
mr.
john
e.
bush
precisely.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct.
you
are
correct.
this
--
we
say,
is
the
same
process
that
any
courts
goes
through
in
determining
sentence
whether
facts
and
circumstances
as
related
to
ones
past
record
as
related
to
ones
behavioral
characteristics
justify
the
imposition
of
either
a
lesser
or
greater
sentence.
otherwise,
we
would
say
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
would
be
capricious.
the
--
this
is
the
--
it
has
the
same
legal
operative
effect.
it's
the
federal
sentencing
statute,
18
u.s.c.
4208.
mr.
john
e.
bush
they
do
not,
your
honor.
one
other
additional
benefit
which
accrues
under
this
type
of
sentence
is
that
referred
to
by
opposing
counsel
and
this
we
submit
is
a
decision.
the
decision
imposed
sentence
is
one
which
is
reviewable
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
sense
of
any
fact
finding
process
or
decision-making
process,
discretionary
of
the
trial
court.
whereas,
other
sentences,
the
classic
sentence
or
the
orthodox
sentence
in
colorado
is
not
reviewable.
and
is
--
the
court
well
knows
this
controversy
is
now
going
on
the
federal
system
as
to
whether
they
should
or
should
not.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
he
commences
the
proceedings.
the
examination
is
conducted
and
it
is
principally
at
the
colorado
psychopathic
hospital
in
denver,
to
the
medical
school
but
the
court
can
commit
him
any
other
place
or
private
psychiatric
institution
or
any
place
else.
pre-sentence
report
is
prepared
in
the
meantime
by
the
probation
department.
both
reports
are
filed
in
the
court.
hearing
is
set
for
imposition
of
sentencing
and
at
that
point
in
time,
the
court
has
three
alternatives
to
sentence
him
under
the
--
which
is
40
days,
2
days,
30
--
to
the
indecent
liberty
statute,
grant
probation
or
sentence
him
under
the
act
of
sentencing
those
sex
offenders.
mr.
john
e.
bush
his
sentence
must
be
one
day,
a
minimum
of
one
day
and
a
maximum
of
one
life.
or
excuse
me,
two
half
life.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
sentence
speaks
by
statute.
the
question
in
our
judgment
presented
is,
does
a
sentencing
statute
re
--
which
responds
to
the
enlighten
approach
to
sentencing
of
undue
process?
in
resolving
this
question,
petitioner
assumes
the
stance
that
most
of
the
critics
of
this
form
of
statute
or
of
the
other
form,
which
is
normally
called
the
sex
psychopath
statute,
assume
and
we
think
that
the
fundamental
error
of
approach
of
this
--
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
that
he
confused
on
statutory
scheme
with
the
statutory
scheme
provided
by
the
statutes
which
are
commonly
known
as
the
“sex
psychopath
laws”.
the
sex
psychopath
laws,
however,
are
civil
commitment
proceedings.
they
are
not
sentencing
statutes.
these
statutes
provides
for
the
basis
for
commitment.
under
the
colorado
law,
the
conviction
provides
the
basis
for
commitment.
very
obviously,
in
the
petitioner's
case,
the
panoply
of
civil
rights
--
of
due
process
rights,
attached
to
his
trial.
we
submit
that
upon
conviction,
he
has
then
subject
to
whatever
sentence
the
legislature
has
in
its
discretion
determined.
referring
to
the
statutes
which
are
generally
talked
about
as
sex
psychopath
laws,
one
is
a
civil
commitment
proceeding
similar
to
the
type
considered
by
the
court
in
minnesota
ex-rail
pearson
versus
probate
court.
the
basic
scheme
there
provided
is
that
a
petition
is
filed
and
the
petition
is
usually
based
upon
the
allegation
of
a
criminal
charge.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
these
proceedings,
no
requirement
has
ever
made
that
that
charged
be
ever
established.
yet,
this
can
form
a
basis
for
a
man's
commitment.
the
second
is
a
civil
commitment
procedure
which
operates
ancillary
to
a
criminal
case.
this
letter
form
takes
two
shapes.
one
is
set
in
motion
by
a
petition
prior
to
conviction;
the
other
permits
the
filing
of
a
petition
to
commit
after
conviction.
some
provide
that
if
commit
--
civil
commitment
is
ordered,
the
criminal
charges
are
dismissed.
however,
the
majority
of
states
provide
that
when
recovery
is
affected,
the
defendant
is
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
either
trial
or
execution
of
his
sentence,
a
procedure,
which
in
our
judgment
is,
could
be
said
and
has
been
said
by
some
to
be
self-defeating.
in
any
event,
this
discussion
in
our
judgment
serves
to
show
--
to
establish
only
one
thing
and
that
is
what
procedure
or
what
scheme
the
state
adopts
is
a
matter
of
wisdom
of
policy,
one
which
should
be
addressed
properly
to
the
state
legislature.
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
this
volume
which
i
did
not
cite,
and
i
apologize
for
not
citing,
by
the
american
bar
foundation.
they
mainly
disabled
law.
i
did
not
find
in
the
law
library.
i
found
it
in
a
medical
school
after
--
library
after
i
had
filed
my
brief.
but
it
seems
to
have
the
best
summation
of
the
sex
psychopath
laws
throughout
the
country.
they
say,
and
this
was
published
in
1961,
that
there
are
27
states
which
have
one
form
or
another
and
they
set
forth
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
our
type
of
law.
mr.
john
e.
bush
in
looking
at
the
chart,
it
appears
there
are
four
utah,
oregon,
colorado,
and
pennsylvania.
and
then
michigan
has
as
counsel
mentioned
one
similar
to
ours
except
that
the
longest
period
that
it
can
be
held
is
limited
by
the
maximum
allowable.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
the
mentally
disabled
in
the
law
by
mr.
lindman
and
mcentire,
the
american
bar
foundation.
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
it
could
work
that
way
starting
from
a
different
point.
the
initial
--
under
the
statute,
the
initial
place
of
commitment
is
the
state
penitentiary,
the
parole
board
then
is
charged
with
the
duty
to
transfer
or
retransfer
between
any
of
the
state
or
institution
based
upon
the
need
for
treatment,
rehabilitation
and
control
which
gives
rise
to
another
very
good
point.
and
that
is,
that
this
statute
permits
the
full
range
of
state
facilities
to
be
available
to
this
individual
if
it
is
a
program
necessary
simply
a
vocational
training
in
order
to
increase
the
one's
maturation
as
some
psychiatrist
say
it's
the
most
pro
--
it
is
the
problem
in
many
of
the
cases
of
sex
offender
--
purely
and
simply
lack
of
maturation.
and,
vocational
training
will
suffice
as
the
necessary
rehabilitation
then
the
man
may
be
transferred
to
the
state
reformatory
and
undertake
a
vocational
training
program.
so
it
can
be
looked
out
mountain
golden
gate,
the
state
penitentiary,
the
state
hospital,
the
state
reformatory.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
it
is
potentially
possible.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
that
i
think
assumes
the
validity
of
their
position
that
you
have
two
sentence
or
two
different
separate
sections
which
have
some
legal
significance.
mr.
john
e.
bush
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
then
that
is
not
the
sentence
--
only
sentence
that
he
is
subjected
to
at
the
time
he
commits
the
act.
this
act
was
in
enforced
and
effect
at
the
time
that
he
committed
that
act.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
was
subject
to
two
sentences.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
it's
the
same
process
by
which
any
sentence
is
imposed.
it's
the
same
process
that
a
federal
judge
goes
through
in
imposing
sentence
under
1842
(a)
08.
unless
you
say
that
a
judge
imposes
a
lesser
or
a
greater
sentences
or
sentence
unrelated
to
any
facts
and
circumstances
and
it
is
a
capricious
act
of
sentencing.
mr.
john
e.
bush
no
longer
than
a
maximum.
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
alright,
then
let's
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
in
the
concept
of
enhanced
penalty,
your
honor,
i
submit
is
nothing
noble
in
the
concept
to
the
law.
it
is
no
different
then
the
situation
that
are
--
that
this
court
considered
in
wanes
versus
oklahoma
where
the
decision
based
by
the
court
was
life
or
death
and
the
court
in
that
case
chose
death.
and
there
certainly
is
no
more
critical
decision
to
a
defendant
than
the
choice
of
death.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
at
no
time,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
is
not
in
the
colorado
courts.
no
and
he
is
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
well,
he
has
exhausted
those
memories
or
remedies.
excuse
me.
there's
no
question
here
of
failure
to
exhaust
state
remedies
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
has
been
to
the
colorado
supreme
court
twice.
mr.
john
e.
bush
he
has
no
absolute
right,
no.
and
he
does
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
the
parole
board.
but
if
the
parole
board
would
determine
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
the
mental
health
laws
do,
your
honor,
and
likewise
the
criminal
insanity
laws
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
we
would
submit
that
the
only
remedy
it
would
have
would
be
matter
of
certiorari
to
review
the
discretionary
decision
of
the
parole
board
in
denying
his
release
and
subsequent
discharge.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
the
one
cited
here,
your
honor.
number
1,
indecent
liberties
carries
less
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
one
--
oh,
you
mean
that
are
--
excuse
me,
i've
misunderstood
the
question.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes.
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
under
40
days,
2
days,
34
would
be
a
minimum
of
one
and
maximum
of
5.
the
only
one
that
is
in
excess
of
the
one
provided
is
first
degree
rape,
which
is
a
minimum
of
3
and
a
maximum
of
life.
the
others
listed,
incest
is
a
maximum
of
20
years.
i
think
they're
all
these.
mr.
john
e.
bush
offhand,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
john
e.
bush
i'm
just
looking
at
my
notes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
the
hearings
are
provided,
your
honor,
under
all
of
the
states
that
have.
what
i
--
what
i
discussed
to
as
the
sex
psychopath
type
statute.
these
were
all
civil
commitment
statues
and
they
operate
the
same
manner
as
most
of
the
mental
health
statutes.
mr.
john
e.
bush
to
my
knowledge,
they
do
not.
and,
i'm
referring
to
the
american
bar
foundation.
i
know
the
pennsylvania
law
does
not
and
i
am
confident
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
yes
this
i
would
have
thought
just
myself
to
what
statute
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
it's
a
consti
--
yes,
i
think
--
since
my
time
is
fleeing,
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
--
clear
up
one
point.
we
have
always
addressed
ourselves
to
a
question
of
substantive
due
process.
is
the
statute
valid
on
its
face
unless
it,
by
words
and
phrases,
explicitly
require
a
second
trial?
now
this
has
been
the
question
that
has
been
addressed
to
the
court.
now,
apparently
petitioner
is
benevolent
in
his
attitude.
first,
we
went
to
the
benefit
of
the
pennsylvania
court
which
is
a
procedural
due
process
question
purely
and
simply.
and
then,
we
end
up
in
our
reply
brief
saying
that
all
that
is
required
is
substantial
justice.
well,
we
have
never
denied
the
sense
of
substantial
justice
should
not
be
afforded.
we
should
never
deny
the
due
process,
should
not
afforded.
we
think
due
process
should
be
afforded
in
each
and
every
stage
of
the
proceedings.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
shape
and
form
of
due
process
which
attaches
to
sentencing.
i
think
the
court
very
clearly
said
what
that
is
in
townson
versus
berg
and
that
is
a
question
of
fair
play.
the
same
questions
here
addressed
to
the
court,
we
think,
were
disposed
of
in
wanes
versus
new
york
and
wanes
versus
oklahoma.
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
draws
a
very
insubstantial
distinction
to
justify
its
finding
or
its
determination
that
this
is
a
separate
trial.
and
of
course,
the
court
does
not
tell
us
what
is
the
quantity
or
quality
or
shape
performed
of
due
process
which
attaches
to
the
second
trial.
so
it's
difficult
for
us
to
respond
to
it.
in
any
event,
the
court
drew
the
analogy,
the
principal
premise
and
their
--
so
logistic
approach
was
that
they
drew
analogy
between
this
law
and
the
habitual
criminal
law
and
relied
on
these
court's
decisions
in
oyler
and
fretag,
chandler
versus
fretag.
we
say
number
one,
the
third
circuit
misinterpreted
the
holdings
in
those
two
decisions.
i
think
the
only
question
addressed
to
the
court
in
both
of
those
decisions
was
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
counsel.
and
the
oyler
case
that
went
on
that
he
was
also
entitled
to
reasonable
notice
which
we
would
think
would
be
obvious
under
any
sentencing
hearing
in
order
to
have
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
very
obviously,
he
must
have
a
reasonable
notice
of
the
hearing.
going
to
the
procedurals,
the
third
point,
in
any
event
as
to
habitual
criminal
act,
why
do
we
say
that
it
is
not
analogous?
we
say
that
we
would
like
to
be
unshackled
from
the
habitual
criminal
law.
this,
the
habitual
criminal
law
has
one
purpose
in
mind
and
that
is
punishment
alone.
we
submit
that
it
represents
the
past.
we
have
tried
to
reject
the
habitual
criminal
law.
it
has
essentially
become
functus
oficio
in
colorado
and
we
have
gone
almost
entirely
to
the
indeterminate
type
sentence.
so
if
we're
bound
by,
as
the
third
circuit
says
the
habitual
criminal
law,
then
we
will
be
mired
so
to
speak
in
the
past
and
will
be
unable
to
progress
to
the
future.
the
other
is,
there's
a
finding
of
fact
and
we
say
this
is
unsubstantial/insubstantial.
if
this
is
true,
colorado
can
overcome
that
point
by
the
simple
device
of
eliminating
the
statute.
well,
it's
a
separate
statutory
section.
well,
we
can
eliminate
that
objection
too
by
a
simple
device
of
amending
the
indecent
liberty
statute
and
adding
thereto
most
of
our
statute,
statute
providing
or
i
won't
say
most
but
many
of
our
statutes
providing
for
sentencing
or
in
separate
sections.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
question
is
what
occurred
at
this
hearing
for
imposition
of
sentence
is
not
before
this
court.
there
is
no
official
record
of
this
kind.
it
has
never
been
--
mr.
john
e.
bush
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
that's
a
generic
word,
your
honor.
and
what
type
of
hearing
that
we
are
talking
about?
in
the
classic
--
oh,
i'm
discussing
now
on
the
classic
sentence
of
a
hearing
to
impose
sentence,
which
very
obviously
he
is
entitled
to
counsel.
he
is
entitled
to
notice.
very
obviously,
he
has
notice
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings.
ordinarily,
he
is
entitled
to
the
information
upon
which
sentencing
will
be
imposed.
colorado
has
never
denied
that
this
information
should
be
withheld
from
the
defendant.
and
in
practice,
it
is
uniformly
done
throughout
the
state.
we
submit
to
the
court
of
the
--
excuse
me.
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
john
e.
bush
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
review
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
would
be
the
soundness
of
the
trial
courts
discretionary
decision
in
imposing
the
sex
offender
stat
--
or
excuse
me,
sentence.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
bush
of
the
record
as
disclosed.
the
pre-sentence
report?
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
it
is
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
clear
that
up.
it
is
not
necessarily
an
ex
parte
record
of
the
probation
report.
the
pre-sentence
report
is
designed
to
serve
the
purpose
of
the
defendant
and
most
defendants
are
satisfied
with
it.
now
if
the
unusual
circumstances
arise
where
he
wishes
to
correct
or
add
to
it,
most
courts
will
permit
that.
so
it
is
not
necess--
it
is
not
an
ex
parte
in
that
sense.
firstly,
ordinarily,
he
has
knowledge
of
all
the
information
contained
in
that
pre-sentence
report.
he
makes
known
to
the
probation
department
what
information
he
wishes
to
have
here.
it's
the
normal
probation
process.
the
probation
department
interviews
his
family,
his
employer
and
so
forth
and
ordinarily,
all
of
the
information
that
he
could
have
--
could
cared
to
have
in
--
have
before
is
contained
in
here
the
very
limited
circumstances
he
is
dissatisfied.
this
i
cannot
represent
that
it
is
dissatisfied
that
he
would
be
guaranteed
the
right
to
subpoena
witnesses
to
correct.
it
is
normal.
he
would
normally
do
that.
mr.
john
e.
bush
this
is
the
normal
practice.
it
is
not
by
specific
rule.
in
denver,
where
about
40%
of
the
criminal
cases
arise
at
the
state
of
colorado,
it's
been
in
that
practice
for
as
long
as
the
man
can
remember.
there
have
been
during
practices
in
some
counties,
smaller
counties,
by
verbal
directive
of
the
chief
--
of
then
chief
justice
two
years
ago,
they
were
directed
as
to
all
counties
that
they
be
made
available.
so
it
is
essentially
in
practice
the
same
as
the
court
rule
32.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well,
we
must
take,
your
honor,
the
allegation
of
the
petitioner
as
true
since
it
was
dismissed
on
its
face
by
the
trial
court,
by
judge
ray
and
affirmed
on
that
basis
by
the
tenth
circuit.
his
allegation
in
the
complaint,
your
honor,
is
that
the
psychiatrist
report
was
made
available
to
his
counsel
but
he
did
not
see
it.
mr.
john
e.
bush
your
honor,
it
was
not
explicit
in
our
rules
and
as
i
say,
the
custom
in
practice
is
that
he
--
this
report
be
made
available
to
defendant's
defense
counsel.
mr.
john
e.
bush
to
the
best,
i
have
consulted
with
trial
judge
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
record.
the
best
of
his
recollection,
he
made
this
available
to
counsel
with
the
stipulation
that
the
conclusions
in
the
report
not
be
made
known
to
the
defendant
for
his
own
benefit.
it
was
not
a
question
of
disclosing
or
keeping
confidential
the
facts
upon
which
these
doctors
conclusion
rested.
and
if
the
counsel
was
free
to
make
use
to
that
report
and
the
facts
contained
therein
insofar
as
he
saw
fit
to
interrogate
the
defendant
if
this
is
true
and
so
forth,
was
this
done
and
on
and
could
have
tested
in
any
manner
the
informational
process
to
see
if
it
was
designed
to
elicit
the
truth
as
that
principles
expressed
in
the
townson
case.
mr.
john
e.
bush
well
this,
your
honor,
i
would
say
a
matter
of
discretion
in
the
trial
court.
i
would
submit
that
the
townson
versus
berg
decision
is
binding
on
the
states
and
that
it
must
be
a
process
which
is
designed
to
elicit
the
truth
and
if
there
are
sound
basis
upon
which
that
informational
process
should
be
corrected
or
supplemented,
then
in
my
judgment
be
abuse
it'd
discretion
to
be
denied
this
type
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
again,
it's
a
qualified
right.
we
use
--
the
defendant
would
have
to
show
a
substantial
basis
for
and
not
just
waste
the
court's
time.
