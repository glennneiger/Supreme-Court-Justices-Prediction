it.
he
can
be
sentenced
under
the
statute
applicable
to
the
particular
offense
without
the
psychiatric
examination
having
been
ordered.
justice
abe
fortas
do
i
correct
to
read
your
statute
as
indicating
that
a
person
convicted
or
sentenced
to
under
the
sex
offender
act
can
be
placed
in
the
hospital
and
then
transferred
by
the
parole
board
back
from
the
hospital
to
prison
where
presumably
the
man
might
serve
the
rest
of
his
life?
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
work
that
way?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
can
also
be
put
in
whatever
colorado
has
equivalent
on
the
dungeon
cell
for
all
these
life?
justice

justice
abe
fortas
even
though
he
is
the
only
hearing
he's
ever
had
is
for
violation
of
the
indecent
liberty
statute
which
itself
provides
for
maximum
sentence
of
10
years?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
read
the
indecent
liberty
statute,
it
says
maximum
sentence
to
10
years.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
have
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
have
to
--
a
judge
has
to
make
a
determinate
or
it
has
to
be
of
the
opinion
as
determinate
to
be
of
the
opinion
when
it
comes
to
extra
the
bodily
harm
to
the
public
or
is
a
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
justice
abe
fortas
in
addition
to
a
determination
being
made
by
the
court
that
he
has
committed
an
offense
of
indecent
liberty.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
that,
sir.
suppose
he
says
he
has
been
unlawfully
detained
and
both
he
says
he
has
committed
as
mentally
ill.
let's
take
that
and
he
has
completely
recovered.
are
you
telling
us
that
your
statute
don't
permit
the
courts
to
entertain
that
action?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
here
let's
suppose
that
these
are
committed
on
the
ground
that
he
is
a
habitual
sex
offender
and
mentally
ill.
that's
what
you
required,
and
mentally
ill.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
and
mentally
ill.
suppose
he
says,
“i
am
now
receiving
excellent
treatment.
i'm
no
longer
mentally
ill”.
and
wouldn't
habeas
corpus
lie
to
test
that
claim?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
are
really
suggesting
to
us
may
be
that
we
have
a
choice
between
acquiring
some
people
think
should
be
done.
that
there
be
some
kind
of
disclosure
by
the
state
and
some
sort
of
a
hearing
with
respect
to
sentencing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
all
instances
or
that
we
can't
touch
this
situation.
