mr.
michael
a.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
francis
eddie
specht
was
convicted
in
colorado
in
1959
of
the
crime
of
indecent
liberties
and
the
statute
prescribes
the
punishment
of
10
years
for
that
crime.
he
was
not
sentenced
under
that
statute.
he
was
sentenced
under
the
sex
offender
statute
to
the
only
sentence
allowed
by
that
statute,
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
one
day
to
life.
that
statute
allows
a
trial
judge
to
sentence
people
convicted
of
the
crime
of
indecent
liberties
and
other
crimes.
if
they
fit
into
a
certain
classification,
the
class
is
a
threat
to
the
public
if
at
large
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
the
issue
which
francis
eddie
specht
presents
to
this
court
is
whether
he
is
entitled
to
participate
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
process
by
which
the
trial
judges
reaches
the
conclusion
that
he
is
in
the
class
eligible
for
a
different
sentence,
under
the
sex
offender
statute
that
is
whether
he
is
a
threat
to
the
public
if
at
large
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
just
a
word
about
the
statute,
there
are
certain
enumerated
offenses,
indecent
liberties,
incest,
they're
all
sex
offenses.
the
statute
says
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
of
one
of
those
offenses
then
the
district
judge,
and
this
is
in
section
1
of
the
statutes
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief,
if
he
has
of
the
--
opinion
that
such
a
person
is
a
threat
to
the
public
if
at
large
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill,
may
in
lieu
of
the
sentence
provided
by
the
statute
defining
the
crime
sentence
him
under
the
sex
offender
statute.
the
act
goes
on
then
to
require
that
the
judge
have
the
person
psychiatrically
examined.
it
allows
him
to
incarcerate
him
for
a
period
of
time
after
conviction
necessary
to
have
the
psychiatric
examination
conducted
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
what?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
to
this
case?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
then
he
has
the
discretion
to
initiate
the
inquiry.
that
is
the
way
i
would
say
it.
he
has
the
discretion
to
have
the
man
examined
psychiatrically.
he
elects
to
proceed
under
this
act
is
one
way
to
say
it
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
but
that
doesn't
commit
him
to
giving
this
sentence
under
this
act.
it's
my
reading
of
the
act.
now,
that's
a
different
reading
in
the
third
circuit
makes
it
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
is
identical.
but
he
begins
to
inquire
and
the
act
provides
that
an
information
gathering
mechanism
and
that
is
the
psychiatric
report
and
since
1957
but
not
before
1957,
it
makes
it
clear
that
he
gets
also
a
pre-sentence
report
from
the
probation
department.
from
1953
to
1957,
the
act
did
require
that
and
i
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
was.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
the
way
i
read
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
supreme
court
case
in
colorado
saying
that
because
i
don't
think
there's
a
case
that's
exactly
raised
that.
but
referring,
and
this
is
in
our
brief
on
page
--
begins
on
page
28
and
over
the
top
of
29,
section
5
of
the
act,
it
says,
“whenever
a
district
court
after
a
psychiatric
examination
of
and
report
on
a
person
convicted
of
any
one
or
more
of
the
crimes
shall
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
to
the
best
interest
of
justice
to
sentence
such
a
person
under
the
provisions
of
this
article.
he
shall
cause
such
person
to
be
arraigned
before
him
and
sentenced”.
now,
i
believe
that
if
you're
going
to
give
meaning
to
that
you
have
to
say
that
after
the
examination,
after
this
information
gathering
procedure
has
occurred,
he
can
then
decide
that
he
does
not
want
to
sentence
him
under
the
sex
offender
statutes.
and
that
emphasizes,
your
honor,
the
critical
aspect
that
we
say
that
this
information
gathering
process
is.
the
determination
whether
the
man
fits
this
classification
and
is
eligible
for
this
sentencing.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
is
in
every
case
required
by
statute.
but
the
psychiatric
examination
is
peculiar
to
this
and
this
emphasizes
in
our
view,
this
--
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
this
classification,
these
standards
which
this
man
has
to
meet
before
he
can
be
sentenced
and
provide
an
information
gathering
process
emphasizes
that
the
legislature
meant
that
these
statutes
were
important
and
they
have
to
be
met
and
they
gave
a
mechanism
to
be
sure
that
they
were
met.
and
what
they
didn't
do
and
what
the
statute
doesn't
do
as
construed
by
the
courts
in
colorado
was
give
the
person
who
is
convicted
a
right
to
participate
in
that
information
gathering
process
by
which
the
judge
makes
the
decision.
now,
whether
you
call
it
discretion,
whether
you
say
he
--
that
he
must
be
of
the
opinion,
he
has
to
reach
a
state
of
mind
that
that
man
is
in
that
classification.
and
we
say,
let
us
at
least
know
what
information
you
are
facing
that
up.
and
if
it's
wrong,
give
us
a
chance
to
contradict
it.
and
we
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
entitles
us
to
do
this,
to
participate
in
this
process
and
to
correct
errors
in
information
upon
which
the
judge
relies.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
the
criminal
statute
in
this
case,
indecent
liberties
is
--
yes.
its
40-2-32
of
the
colorado
statutes
and
the
sex
offenders
statute
is
39-19-1
through
10.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
not
if
they
were
in
the
same
statute
and
the
same
words,
no.
in
other
words,
if
that
statute
says
you
can
give
him
10
years
or
if
you
find
he's
in
this
class,
then
you
can
give
him
one
day
to
life.
my
position
would
be
the
same
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
legislature
has
done
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
this
too.
as
--
they
have
said
they're
only
certain
people
you
can
do
this
too,
threats
to
the
public
or
habitual
offenders
and
mentally
ill.
in
the
vanderhoof
case,
citing
colorado
and
that
cited
in
our
brief,
the
--
that
--
that
those
--
the
objection
made
by
mr.
vanderhoof,
he
said,
"this
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
just
gives
the
judge
carte
blanche
to
do
what
he
wants".
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
“oh,
no,
it
doesn't.
he
merely
finds
a
fact.
the
legislature
has
made
the
classification”.
and
so
we
say
that
because
that
fact
--
well,
in
one
of
the
phrase
of
this
court
is
of
critical
importance.
he
is
entitled
to
participate
in
the
decision-making
process.
in
another
line
of
authority
in
this
court,
the
recidivist
cases
it's
essentially
independent
of
the
fact
of
conviction.
the
fact
that
he
is
a
threat
to
the
public
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
those
cases,
the
person
is
entitled
to
participate
because
of
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
nobody
knows,
your
honor,
because
the
act
doesn't
require
the
judge
to
say
so
and
there's
no
indication.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
yes
it
is,
where
he
sentence
immediately
your
honor
but
in
fairness
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
he's
not
--
well,
i
think
that
i
--
it's
a
real
problem
if
he's
not
treatable
because
then
there's
just
--
you're
putting
him
in
--
you're
imprisoning
him
with
no
hope
of
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
right.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right.
the
statute
goes
on.
however,
your
honor,
it
says
really
what
it
did
--
adminis
--
it
used
to
be
before
1957
that
the
trial
court
said
which
date
--
institution
the
man
went
to
and
he
could
send
to
a
hospital
or
the
appropriate
institution.
in
1957,
when
they
amended
the
statute,
they
say
you
can
send
them
to
the
penitentiary
but
the
parole
board
must
within
six
months
review
the
case
and
decide
on
an
appropriate
institution.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
however,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
why
francis
eddie
specht
was
sent
and
the
record
does
show
that
he
was
sent
in
november
of
1959
to
the
penitentiary
and
he
was
there
until
the
record
shows
1964.
but
we
didn't
raise
that
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
don't
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
think
that's
proper
for
me
to
argue
it
here.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
no.
no,
what
--
no,
aft
--
just
after
his
sentence
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
colorado
state
psychopathic
hospital,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
guess
in
(inaudible).
mr.
michael
a.
williams
they
--
it's
clear.
they
incarcerated
him
and
keep
him
incarcerated
between
the
period
of
his
conviction
and
the
sentencing.
and
after
the
sentencing,
it's
clear
that
he
goes
down
to
the
penitentiary.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
the
colorado
statute
is
identical
in
all
material
respects
i
think
to
the
pennsylvania
statute,
the
barr-walker
act.
the
barr-walker
act
was
enacted
in
1951;
the
colorado
statute
in
1953.
and
i
think
the
copy
--
the
third
circuit
considered
the
barr-walker
act
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
maroney,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
they
said
that
this
process,
this
act,
wherein
when
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
then
an
inquiry
is
made
whether
he
has
some
additional
characteristics,
some
additional
attributes,
maybe
he
has
them,
he
gets
a
much
more
severe
punishment.
they
said
that
would
define
a
new
criminal
status.
and
because
it's
a
new
criminal
status,
he
has
to
have
the
entire
--
the
full
panoply
of
procedural
rights
consistent
with
that
then
they
argued
about
the
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporates
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
they
didn't
agree
on
that
but
they
agreed
on
everything
else.
and
if
that's
correct,
this
is
the
same
case.
as
i
indicated,
the
recidivist
cases
are
relevant,
pertinent
that
it
--
this
is
an
--
as
punishment
at
the
very
least.
well,
i
won't
say
it
the
very
least
because
i've
got
another
position
at
the
very
least
and
that's
the
kent
case.
and
this
is
at
least
a
decision
of
critical
importance
to
the
man
whether
he's
going
to
be
a
definite
sentence.
ten
years,
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
wait
and
he's
out
or
whether
its
one
day
and
life
and
under
this
statute,
he
can't
be
free.
no
absolute
release
unless
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
“the
interest
of
society
and
the
welfare”
--
the
dictates
of
justice
in
a
welfare
society
dictate
it
that
he
be
free
otherwise
the
best
he
can
get
is
parole,
supervised
freedom.
its
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
correct.
interesting
--
interestingly
enough
however,
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
said
he
has
not
bound
by
that
psychiatrist's
opinion.
and
that's
that
the
case
of
trueblood
against
tinsley,
the
first
colorado
case
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
was
before
the
colorado
court
and
in
that
case,
the
psychiatrist
report
said
this
man
is
not
mentally
ill
and
it
didn't
say
that
he
was
a
threat
to
the
public.
now,
it
was
somewhat
ambiguous
i
think
on
whether
it
was
enough
of
a
basis
to
--
well,
whether
it
was
required,
it
affirmatively
said
that
he's
a
threat
to
the
public.
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
“we're
going
to
accept
your
argument,
mr.
trueblood
that
this
psychiatrist
report
doesn't
--
really
affirmatively
support
the
judge's
action
but
the
judge
isn't
bound
by
it.”
actually,
i
think
they
were
saying
the
same
thing
here
that
the
same
instruction
we
give
to
juries
in
colorado
every
time
there's
an
expert
witness.
say,
you're
the
trier
of
fact
and
you
can
hear
all
the
facts
and
you
can
accept
that
expert's
opinion
as
it
appeals
to
your
reason
and
intellect.
and
i
think
they
were
saying
the
same
thing
here
to
the
judge
or
that
--
to
mr.
trueblood,
they're
saying
the
judge
can
decide
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
his
and
the
rest.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
rest
was
as
a
pre-sentence
investigation
report.
the
authority
that
has
been
--
i
won't
say,
consistently
say
that
against
us
because
the
first
time
that
was
decided
against
us,
it
--
is
in
the
tenth
circuit
by
judge
murray
is
the
case
of
williams
against
new
york
in
which
this
court
said
that
--
i
think
that
was
a
pretty
narrow
holding.
it
was
the
question
in
--
the
holding
in
that
case
that
the
judge
can't
consider
information
developed
out
of
court.
that
he
is
not
limited
to
listening
to
information
developed
in
court
with
cross-examination.
but
that
holding
has
been
expanded
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
is
argued
before
this
court
in
a
greatly
expanded
sense
to
justify
a
procedure
where
not
only
is
the
judge
considered
the
information
developed
out
of
court
but
he
doesn't
tell
you
what
it
is?
you
can't
see
it
if
you
asked
so
there's
no
way
of
knowing
it
if
it's
wrong.
now
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
it
would
have
bearing
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
it
would
certainly
authorize
the
judge
to
consider
as
an
initial
matter
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
and
the
psychiatrist
report.
it
would
say,
yes,
you
can
look
at
it
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
looking
at
it
but
if
it
doesn't
say,
you
can
keep
it
to
yourself.
you
can
keep
your
cards
in
your
chest
here
and
he'll
never
know
why
you're
doing
what
you
did.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right
and
i
don't
concede
that
at
all.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
can't
say
anything
else
but
yes,
they
do.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
with
some
comments
that
might
indicate
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
some
members
of
the
court
think
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
there
ought
to
be
a
disclosure.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right
and
if
you're
talking
only
about
working
within
the
statutory
limits
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
of
discretion
that
the
legislature
put
on
that
judge.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
habitual
criminal
is
a
--
is
the
most
common
one.
in
colorado
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
if
you're
an
habitual
criminal,
you're
entitled
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment
and
the
jury
has
to
find
it
after
the
conviction
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
i
would
cite
to
it
--
to
you
the
two
cases
by
this
court,
oyler
against
boles
and
chandler-fretag
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
and
frankly,
i
haven't
--
i
don't
know
whether
that
--
you're
characteristically
entitled
to
a
prospect
here,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
pretty
risky
to
have
a
procedure
where
you
didn't
in
view
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
chandler
and
fretag
and
oyler
against
boles
that
where
a
--
where
you're
considering
this
enhanced
punishment
and
it
depends
on
the
factor
that
it's
essentially
independent
of
the
conviction.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
or
by
the
trier
of
fact,
its
written
by
the
jury.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
right.
i
think
if
but
--
i
think
it
was
a
judge
in
oregon.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
which?
the
question
about
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
it
is.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
we
don't
have
a
case
that
says
so
but
i
think
--
i
would
think
i
would
expect
the
colorado
court
to
obtain
it
but
i'd
like
--
i
don't
know
how
that
correct
it
because
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
say,
why?
he
decided
what
convinced
them,
what
persuaded
them.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
well,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
colorado
cases
that
go
at
the
constitutionality.
they
say
two
or
three
times
where
we've
looked
at
this
record
and
we
think
there
is
enough
to
justify
the
judge
making
the
decision.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
i
would
say
that
he
better
have
something
else
beside
the
psychiatrist
report
that
the
supreme
court
concede
because
in
the
case
of
trueblood
against
tinsley,
they
say
--
they
said,
and
i
think
all
they
had
there
was
a
psychiatrist
report
and
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
and
they
said
we
have
looked
at
this
record
and
there
is
sufficient
in
here
to
justify
the
judge
reaching
this
conclusion
in
spite
of
some
of
this
language
of
the
psychiatrist.
but
well,
there's
that
case
and
then
there's
the
--
there's
the
ray
case
where
it's
clear
that
the
court
does
look
at
this
and
i
think
in
the
sutton
case
and
they
do
look
for
those
are
all
habeas
corpus
not
on
direct
appeal;
they
are
all
rule
35
motions
to
modify,
vacate
or
amend
the
sentence.
but
they
looked
at
it.
but
i
--
as
i
read
the
colorado
cases,
your
honor,
if
--
the
judge
went
against
here
--
there
was
no
indication
in
any
of
that
then
i'd
say,
yes,
he'd
--
he
would
have
trouble
of
it.
but
i
would
still
object.
i
still
object
to
the
procedure
because
that
doesn't
really
give
you
the
--
at
the
proper
level
the
right
to
intervene.
and
the
man
can
ever
wrong
name
on
a
psychiatrist
report
for
all
we
know.
we
tried
to
see
it.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
the
parole
board,
your
honor,
is
required
to
review
his
case
initially
within
six
months
of
his
being
incarcerated
and
then
annually.
they
must
review
and
there
is
language
in
the
statute
which
indicates,
although,
not
very
precisely
that
the
authorities
who
have
the
custody
this
man
must
make
reports
and
information
available
to
the
parole
board.
the
parole
board
then
has
almost
plenary
authority
to
commit
or
to
parole
and
to
recommit
and
its
clear
that
that's
the
primary
vehicle
of
letting
him
walk
around
anyway.
although,
parole
is
--
the
state
in
colorado
be
nothing
but
jail
outside
of
the
walls
and
they
could
(voice
overlap)
any
time.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
no.
i
don't
--
well,
i
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
think
he
gets
to
appear
before
the
board
say,”
oh,
i
think
he
ought
to
be
out,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
in
the
statute
but
both
mr.
bush
and
mr.
moore
served
on
that
parole
board
from
time
to
time
so
i'm
sure
they
could
tell
you.
i
think
he
does
but
i
don't
know
whether
they
say
--
whether
they
lay
their
cards
on
the
table
and
say,
“look,
here's
why
you're
still
here
and
here's
why
were
not
going
to
let
you
out
and
what
have
you
got
to
say
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
it's
a
pretty
far
out
theory,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
on
parole.
that
isn't
--
well,
i
don't
think
that's
more
lenient.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
if
the
interest
to
society,
if
--
and
--
the
welfare
society
and
interest
of
justice
dictate
it,
it
must
affirmatively
appear.
that's,
your
honor,
he
get
an
absolute
release
and
it's
our
position
that
--
oh,
that
doesn't
approach
that
--
you
can
get
out
and
walk
around
and
may
be
you
get
--
but
that's
not
a
more
lenient
sentence
you
can
be
out
to
jail
may
be
but
there's
quite
a
difference
between
being
out,
free
to
come
and
go
as
you
please,
than
in
reporting
to
a
supervisor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
he
is
already
--
you
mean
to
stay
put?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
you
mean,
habeas
available?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
absolutely
clear,
your
honor.
one
of
the
colorado
case
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right.
they
say
habeas
corpus
is
not
available
to
test
the
question
as
trueblood
against
tinsley
in
the
state
court
where
they
specifically
said
that
he
can
have
habeas
corpus
and
make
the
parole
board
do
their
duty
and
let
him
out.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
not
in
this
form.
i
think
those
are
the
only
two
to
have
it
just
in
his
form.
do
you
--
i
think
there
about
30
states
that
have
got
some
kind
of
a
sexual
psychopath
statute.
and
i
might
just
say,
there's
one
more
remark
that
the
tenth
circuit
relied
on
two
state
court
case,
one
was
wisconsin
and
one
was
in
oregon
case,
is
--
its
sort
of
similar.
the
wisconsin
case,
you
cant'
keep
him
pass.
under
the
wisconsin
statute,
pass
the
maximum
term
without
giving
him
the
very
hearing
we
say
should
have
here.
and
in
oregon,
the
case
was
whether
he's
entitled
to
jury
trial
i
suppose.
so
that
neither
one
of
those
are
picked
--
be
relevant
here.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
may
i
respond
to
that,
your
honor?
the
inference
here
is
that
he
would
have
had
the
right
that
colorado
courts
might
let
him
see
that
psychiatrist
report.
in
his
petition,
in
this
page
7
of
the
record,
he
says,
“in
court,
counsel
for
petitioner
and
the
district
attorney
were
reading
the
hospital's
report.
the
petitioner
attempted
to
read
the
same
over
his
counsel
shoulder.
the
court
had
much.
petitioner
mr.
specht,
report
is
solely
for
your
counsel
and
district
attorney.
behind
this
legal
wire
certain
of
secrecy.
petitioner
was
sentence”.
that's
what
he
says
here.
and
as
mr.
bush
says,
there'd
be
no
evidentiary
hearing.
when
he
responded
to
this
in
the
federal
court,
he
didn't
say
that
so
specifically
or
that
is
so
specifically
just
said.
everything
that
isn't
admitted
is
denied.
and
that
was
his
response
to
their.
and
--
and
if
we're
going
to
go,
your
honor,
we
have
the
supreme
court
record,
that
francis
eddie
specht
put
before
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
when
he
said
this
sentence
is
unconstitutional
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
said
that's
unconstitutional
is
because
he
says
that
he
was
not
able
to
look
at
the
psychiatrist
report.
that's
in
his
brief.
and
mr.
bush,
well,
i
don't
know
if
mr.
bush
or
the
attorney
general
wrote
the
brief.
responding
to
that,
and
i
said,
on
the
petitioner's
report,
he
alleges
that
the
sentencing
procedure
denied
him
equal
protection
of
laws
and
due
process.
this
first
phase
is
for
this
attack
is
that
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
he
was
not
afforded
due
process.
this
assertion
is
apparently
based
on
a
false
premise
that
the
sentencing
must
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
trial
such
as
examination
of
the
psychiatrist
report
and
the
right
to
cross-examining
the
expert's
submitting
a
report.
we
know
of
no
principle
which
requires
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
to
the
information
upon
which
the
judge
may
properly
rely
or
utilized
in
determining
the
proper
sentence.
that's
what
the
attorney
general
said
in
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
and
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
in
their
opinion
says,
mr.
specht
several
contentions
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
are
not
properly
founded.
so,
they
clearly
said
and
he
has
said
consistently,
“i
ought
to
be
able
to
look
and
i
ought
to
know”.
and
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said,
“no,
sir”.
our
basic
point
is
that
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
is
that
the
--
this
may
be
an
unlikely
response
to
sentencing.
the
legislature
has
put
some
limits
on
the
judge
and
he
said
if
you're
going
to
do
this,
we
want
to
be
sure
we've
got
the
right
guys.
we've
expressed
ourselves
in
general
and
we
say
10
years
of
indecent
liberties
but
we're
going
to
give
you
the
power
to
do
more
than
that.
there
are
some
peop
--
they've
given
standards.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said
those
are
legislative
standards;
it's
a
fact
finding
process
and
all
we
say
is
that
important.
we
are
getting
to
the
act.
we
don't
have
the
right
to
help.
make
sure
that
that
information
of
which
those
findings
are
made
is
correct
in
a
traditional
way
that
we
do
these
things
in
this
country.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
francis
eddie
specht
was
convicted
in
colorado
in
1959
of
the
crime
of
indecent
liberties
and
the
statute
prescribes
the
punishment
of
10
years
for
that
crime.
he
was
not
sentenced
under
that
statute.
he
was
sentenced
under
the
sex
offender
statute
to
the
only
sentence
allowed
by
that
statute,
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
one
day
to
life.
that
statute
allows
a
trial
judge
to
sentence
people
convicted
of
the
crime
of
indecent
liberties
and
other
crimes.
if
they
fit
into
a
certain
classification,
the
class
is
a
threat
to
the
public
if
at
large
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
the
issue
which
francis
eddie
specht
presents
to
this
court
is
whether
he
is
entitled
to
participate
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
process
by
which
the
trial
judges
reaches
the
conclusion
that
he
is
in
the
class
eligible
for
a
different
sentence,
under
the
sex
offender
statute
that
is
whether
he
is
a
threat
to
the
public
if
at
large
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
just
a
word
about
the
statute,
there
are
certain
enumerated
offenses,
indecent
liberties,
incest,
they're
all
sex
offenses.
the
statute
says
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
of
one
of
those
offenses
then
the
district
judge,
and
this
is
in
section
1
of
the
statutes
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief,
if
he
has
of
the
--
opinion
that
such
a
person
is
a
threat
to
the
public
if
at
large
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill,
may
in
lieu
of
the
sentence
provided
by
the
statute
defining
the
crime
sentence
him
under
the
sex
offender
statute.
the
act
goes
on
then
to
require
that
the
judge
have
the
person
psychiatrically
examined.
it
allows
him
to
incarcerate
him
for
a
period
of
time
after
conviction
necessary
to
have
the
psychiatric
examination
conducted
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
what?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
to
this
case?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
then
he
has
the
discretion
to
initiate
the
inquiry.
that
is
the
way
i
would
say
it.
he
has
the
discretion
to
have
the
man
examined
psychiatrically.
he
elects
to
proceed
under
this
act
is
one
way
to
say
it
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
but
that
doesn't
commit
him
to
giving
this
sentence
under
this
act.
it's
my
reading
of
the
act.
now,
that's
a
different
reading
in
the
third
circuit
makes
it
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
is
identical.
but
he
begins
to
inquire
and
the
act
provides
that
an
information
gathering
mechanism
and
that
is
the
psychiatric
report
and
since
1957
but
not
before
1957,
it
makes
it
clear
that
he
gets
also
a
pre-sentence
report
from
the
probation
department.
from
1953
to
1957,
the
act
did
require
that
and
i
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
was.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
the
way
i
read
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
supreme
court
case
in
colorado
saying
that
because
i
don't
think
there's
a
case
that's
exactly
raised
that.
but
referring,
and
this
is
in
our
brief
on
page
--
begins
on
page
28
and
over
the
top
of
29,
section
5
of
the
act,
it
says,
“whenever
a
district
court
after
a
psychiatric
examination
of
and
report
on
a
person
convicted
of
any
one
or
more
of
the
crimes
shall
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
to
the
best
interest
of
justice
to
sentence
such
a
person
under
the
provisions
of
this
article.
he
shall
cause
such
person
to
be
arraigned
before
him
and
sentenced”.
now,
i
believe
that
if
you're
going
to
give
meaning
to
that
you
have
to
say
that
after
the
examination,
after
this
information
gathering
procedure
has
occurred,
he
can
then
decide
that
he
does
not
want
to
sentence
him
under
the
sex
offender
statutes.
and
that
emphasizes,
your
honor,
the
critical
aspect
that
we
say
that
this
information
gathering
process
is.
the
determination
whether
the
man
fits
this
classification
and
is
eligible
for
this
sentencing.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
is
in
every
case
required
by
statute.
but
the
psychiatric
examination
is
peculiar
to
this
and
this
emphasizes
in
our
view,
this
--
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
this
classification,
these
standards
which
this
man
has
to
meet
before
he
can
be
sentenced
and
provide
an
information
gathering
process
emphasizes
that
the
legislature
meant
that
these
statutes
were
important
and
they
have
to
be
met
and
they
gave
a
mechanism
to
be
sure
that
they
were
met.
and
what
they
didn't
do
and
what
the
statute
doesn't
do
as
construed
by
the
courts
in
colorado
was
give
the
person
who
is
convicted
a
right
to
participate
in
that
information
gathering
process
by
which
the
judge
makes
the
decision.
now,
whether
you
call
it
discretion,
whether
you
say
he
--
that
he
must
be
of
the
opinion,
he
has
to
reach
a
state
of
mind
that
that
man
is
in
that
classification.
and
we
say,
let
us
at
least
know
what
information
you
are
facing
that
up.
and
if
it's
wrong,
give
us
a
chance
to
contradict
it.
and
we
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
entitles
us
to
do
this,
to
participate
in
this
process
and
to
correct
errors
in
information
upon
which
the
judge
relies.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
the
criminal
statute
in
this
case,
indecent
liberties
is
--
yes.
its
40-2-32
of
the
colorado
statutes
and
the
sex
offenders
statute
is
39-19-1
through
10.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
not
if
they
were
in
the
same
statute
and
the
same
words,
no.
in
other
words,
if
that
statute
says
you
can
give
him
10
years
or
if
you
find
he's
in
this
class,
then
you
can
give
him
one
day
to
life.
my
position
would
be
the
same
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
legislature
has
done
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
this
too.
as
--
they
have
said
they're
only
certain
people
you
can
do
this
too,
threats
to
the
public
or
habitual
offenders
and
mentally
ill.
in
the
vanderhoof
case,
citing
colorado
and
that
cited
in
our
brief,
the
--
that
--
that
those
--
the
objection
made
by
mr.
vanderhoof,
he
said,
"this
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
just
gives
the
judge
carte
blanche
to
do
what
he
wants".
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
“oh,
no,
it
doesn't.
he
merely
finds
a
fact.
the
legislature
has
made
the
classification”.
and
so
we
say
that
because
that
fact
--
well,
in
one
of
the
phrase
of
this
court
is
of
critical
importance.
he
is
entitled
to
participate
in
the
decision-making
process.
in
another
line
of
authority
in
this
court,
the
recidivist
cases
it's
essentially
independent
of
the
fact
of
conviction.
the
fact
that
he
is
a
threat
to
the
public
or
an
habitual
offender
and
mentally
ill.
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
those
cases,
the
person
is
entitled
to
participate
because
of
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
nobody
knows,
your
honor,
because
the
act
doesn't
require
the
judge
to
say
so
and
there's
no
indication.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
yes
it
is,
where
he
sentence
immediately
your
honor
but
in
fairness
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
he's
not
--
well,
i
think
that
i
--
it's
a
real
problem
if
he's
not
treatable
because
then
there's
just
--
you're
putting
him
in
--
you're
imprisoning
him
with
no
hope
of
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
right.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right.
the
statute
goes
on.
however,
your
honor,
it
says
really
what
it
did
--
adminis
--
it
used
to
be
before
1957
that
the
trial
court
said
which
date
--
institution
the
man
went
to
and
he
could
send
to
a
hospital
or
the
appropriate
institution.
in
1957,
when
they
amended
the
statute,
they
say
you
can
send
them
to
the
penitentiary
but
the
parole
board
must
within
six
months
review
the
case
and
decide
on
an
appropriate
institution.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
however,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
why
francis
eddie
specht
was
sent
and
the
record
does
show
that
he
was
sent
in
november
of
1959
to
the
penitentiary
and
he
was
there
until
the
record
shows
1964.
but
we
didn't
raise
that
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
don't
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
think
that's
proper
for
me
to
argue
it
here.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
no.
no,
what
--
no,
aft
--
just
after
his
sentence
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
colorado
state
psychopathic
hospital,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
guess
in
(inaudible).
mr.
michael
a.
williams
they
--
it's
clear.
they
incarcerated
him
and
keep
him
incarcerated
between
the
period
of
his
conviction
and
the
sentencing.
and
after
the
sentencing,
it's
clear
that
he
goes
down
to
the
penitentiary.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
the
colorado
statute
is
identical
in
all
material
respects
i
think
to
the
pennsylvania
statute,
the
barr-walker
act.
the
barr-walker
act
was
enacted
in
1951;
the
colorado
statute
in
1953.
and
i
think
the
copy
--
the
third
circuit
considered
the
barr-walker
act
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
maroney,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
they
said
that
this
process,
this
act,
wherein
when
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
then
an
inquiry
is
made
whether
he
has
some
additional
characteristics,
some
additional
attributes,
maybe
he
has
them,
he
gets
a
much
more
severe
punishment.
they
said
that
would
define
a
new
criminal
status.
and
because
it's
a
new
criminal
status,
he
has
to
have
the
entire
--
the
full
panoply
of
procedural
rights
consistent
with
that
then
they
argued
about
the
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporates
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
they
didn't
agree
on
that
but
they
agreed
on
everything
else.
and
if
that's
correct,
this
is
the
same
case.
as
i
indicated,
the
recidivist
cases
are
relevant,
pertinent
that
it
--
this
is
an
--
as
punishment
at
the
very
least.
well,
i
won't
say
it
the
very
least
because
i've
got
another
position
at
the
very
least
and
that's
the
kent
case.
and
this
is
at
least
a
decision
of
critical
importance
to
the
man
whether
he's
going
to
be
a
definite
sentence.
ten
years,
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
wait
and
he's
out
or
whether
its
one
day
and
life
and
under
this
statute,
he
can't
be
free.
no
absolute
release
unless
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
“the
interest
of
society
and
the
welfare”
--
the
dictates
of
justice
in
a
welfare
society
dictate
it
that
he
be
free
otherwise
the
best
he
can
get
is
parole,
supervised
freedom.
its
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
correct.
interesting
--
interestingly
enough
however,
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
said
he
has
not
bound
by
that
psychiatrist's
opinion.
and
that's
that
the
case
of
trueblood
against
tinsley,
the
first
colorado
case
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
was
before
the
colorado
court
and
in
that
case,
the
psychiatrist
report
said
this
man
is
not
mentally
ill
and
it
didn't
say
that
he
was
a
threat
to
the
public.
now,
it
was
somewhat
ambiguous
i
think
on
whether
it
was
enough
of
a
basis
to
--
well,
whether
it
was
required,
it
affirmatively
said
that
he's
a
threat
to
the
public.
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
said,
“we're
going
to
accept
your
argument,
mr.
trueblood
that
this
psychiatrist
report
doesn't
--
really
affirmatively
support
the
judge's
action
but
the
judge
isn't
bound
by
it.”
actually,
i
think
they
were
saying
the
same
thing
here
that
the
same
instruction
we
give
to
juries
in
colorado
every
time
there's
an
expert
witness.
say,
you're
the
trier
of
fact
and
you
can
hear
all
the
facts
and
you
can
accept
that
expert's
opinion
as
it
appeals
to
your
reason
and
intellect.
and
i
think
they
were
saying
the
same
thing
here
to
the
judge
or
that
--
to
mr.
trueblood,
they're
saying
the
judge
can
decide
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
his
and
the
rest.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
rest
was
as
a
pre-sentence
investigation
report.
the
authority
that
has
been
--
i
won't
say,
consistently
say
that
against
us
because
the
first
time
that
was
decided
against
us,
it
--
is
in
the
tenth
circuit
by
judge
murray
is
the
case
of
williams
against
new
york
in
which
this
court
said
that
--
i
think
that
was
a
pretty
narrow
holding.
it
was
the
question
in
--
the
holding
in
that
case
that
the
judge
can't
consider
information
developed
out
of
court.
that
he
is
not
limited
to
listening
to
information
developed
in
court
with
cross-examination.
but
that
holding
has
been
expanded
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
is
argued
before
this
court
in
a
greatly
expanded
sense
to
justify
a
procedure
where
not
only
is
the
judge
considered
the
information
developed
out
of
court
but
he
doesn't
tell
you
what
it
is?
you
can't
see
it
if
you
asked
so
there's
no
way
of
knowing
it
if
it's
wrong.
now
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
it
would
have
bearing
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
it
would
certainly
authorize
the
judge
to
consider
as
an
initial
matter
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
and
the
psychiatrist
report.
it
would
say,
yes,
you
can
look
at
it
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
you
looking
at
it
but
if
it
doesn't
say,
you
can
keep
it
to
yourself.
you
can
keep
your
cards
in
your
chest
here
and
he'll
never
know
why
you're
doing
what
you
did.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right
and
i
don't
concede
that
at
all.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
can't
say
anything
else
but
yes,
they
do.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
with
some
comments
that
might
indicate
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
some
members
of
the
court
think
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
there
ought
to
be
a
disclosure.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right
and
if
you're
talking
only
about
working
within
the
statutory
limits
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
of
discretion
that
the
legislature
put
on
that
judge.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
habitual
criminal
is
a
--
is
the
most
common
one.
in
colorado
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
if
you're
an
habitual
criminal,
you're
entitled
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment
and
the
jury
has
to
find
it
after
the
conviction
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
i
would
cite
to
it
--
to
you
the
two
cases
by
this
court,
oyler
against
boles
and
chandler-fretag
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
--
and
frankly,
i
haven't
--
i
don't
know
whether
that
--
you're
characteristically
entitled
to
a
prospect
here,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
pretty
risky
to
have
a
procedure
where
you
didn't
in
view
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
chandler
and
fretag
and
oyler
against
boles
that
where
a
--
where
you're
considering
this
enhanced
punishment
and
it
depends
on
the
factor
that
it's
essentially
independent
of
the
conviction.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
or
by
the
trier
of
fact,
its
written
by
the
jury.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
right.
i
think
if
but
--
i
think
it
was
a
judge
in
oregon.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
which?
the
question
about
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
it
is.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
we
don't
have
a
case
that
says
so
but
i
think
--
i
would
think
i
would
expect
the
colorado
court
to
obtain
it
but
i'd
like
--
i
don't
know
how
that
correct
it
because
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
say,
why?
he
decided
what
convinced
them,
what
persuaded
them.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
well,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
colorado
cases
that
go
at
the
constitutionality.
they
say
two
or
three
times
where
we've
looked
at
this
record
and
we
think
there
is
enough
to
justify
the
judge
making
the
decision.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
i
would
say
that
he
better
have
something
else
beside
the
psychiatrist
report
that
the
supreme
court
concede
because
in
the
case
of
trueblood
against
tinsley,
they
say
--
they
said,
and
i
think
all
they
had
there
was
a
psychiatrist
report
and
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
and
they
said
we
have
looked
at
this
record
and
there
is
sufficient
in
here
to
justify
the
judge
reaching
this
conclusion
in
spite
of
some
of
this
language
of
the
psychiatrist.
but
well,
there's
that
case
and
then
there's
the
--
there's
the
ray
case
where
it's
clear
that
the
court
does
look
at
this
and
i
think
in
the
sutton
case
and
they
do
look
for
those
are
all
habeas
corpus
not
on
direct
appeal;
they
are
all
rule
35
motions
to
modify,
vacate
or
amend
the
sentence.
but
they
looked
at
it.
but
i
--
as
i
read
the
colorado
cases,
your
honor,
if
--
the
judge
went
against
here
--
there
was
no
indication
in
any
of
that
then
i'd
say,
yes,
he'd
--
he
would
have
trouble
of
it.
but
i
would
still
object.
i
still
object
to
the
procedure
because
that
doesn't
really
give
you
the
--
at
the
proper
level
the
right
to
intervene.
and
the
man
can
ever
wrong
name
on
a
psychiatrist
report
for
all
we
know.
we
tried
to
see
it.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
the
parole
board,
your
honor,
is
required
to
review
his
case
initially
within
six
months
of
his
being
incarcerated
and
then
annually.
they
must
review
and
there
is
language
in
the
statute
which
indicates,
although,
not
very
precisely
that
the
authorities
who
have
the
custody
this
man
must
make
reports
and
information
available
to
the
parole
board.
the
parole
board
then
has
almost
plenary
authority
to
commit
or
to
parole
and
to
recommit
and
its
clear
that
that's
the
primary
vehicle
of
letting
him
walk
around
anyway.
although,
parole
is
--
the
state
in
colorado
be
nothing
but
jail
outside
of
the
walls
and
they
could
(voice
overlap)
any
time.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
no.
i
don't
--
well,
i
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
i
think
he
gets
to
appear
before
the
board
say,”
oh,
i
think
he
ought
to
be
out,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
in
the
statute
but
both
mr.
bush
and
mr.
moore
served
on
that
parole
board
from
time
to
time
so
i'm
sure
they
could
tell
you.
i
think
he
does
but
i
don't
know
whether
they
say
--
whether
they
lay
their
cards
on
the
table
and
say,
“look,
here's
why
you're
still
here
and
here's
why
were
not
going
to
let
you
out
and
what
have
you
got
to
say
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
it's
a
pretty
far
out
theory,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
on
parole.
that
isn't
--
well,
i
don't
think
that's
more
lenient.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes.
if
the
interest
to
society,
if
--
and
--
the
welfare
society
and
interest
of
justice
dictate
it,
it
must
affirmatively
appear.
that's,
your
honor,
he
get
an
absolute
release
and
it's
our
position
that
--
oh,
that
doesn't
approach
that
--
you
can
get
out
and
walk
around
and
may
be
you
get
--
but
that's
not
a
more
lenient
sentence
you
can
be
out
to
jail
may
be
but
there's
quite
a
difference
between
being
out,
free
to
come
and
go
as
you
please,
than
in
reporting
to
a
supervisor.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
he
is
already
--
you
mean
to
stay
put?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
you
mean,
habeas
available?
mr.
michael
a.
williams
absolutely
clear,
your
honor.
one
of
the
colorado
case
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
that's
right.
they
say
habeas
corpus
is
not
available
to
test
the
question
as
trueblood
against
tinsley
in
the
state
court
where
they
specifically
said
that
he
can
have
habeas
corpus
and
make
the
parole
board
do
their
duty
and
let
him
out.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
well,
not
in
this
form.
i
think
those
are
the
only
two
to
have
it
just
in
his
form.
do
you
--
i
think
there
about
30
states
that
have
got
some
kind
of
a
sexual
psychopath
statute.
and
i
might
just
say,
there's
one
more
remark
that
the
tenth
circuit
relied
on
two
state
court
case,
one
was
wisconsin
and
one
was
in
oregon
case,
is
--
its
sort
of
similar.
the
wisconsin
case,
you
cant'
keep
him
pass.
under
the
wisconsin
statute,
pass
the
maximum
term
without
giving
him
the
very
hearing
we
say
should
have
here.
and
in
oregon,
the
case
was
whether
he's
entitled
to
jury
trial
i
suppose.
so
that
neither
one
of
those
are
picked
--
be
relevant
here.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
a.
williams
may
i
respond
to
that,
your
honor?
the
inference
here
is
that
he
would
have
had
the
right
that
colorado
courts
might
let
him
see
that
psychiatrist
report.
in
his
petition,
in
this
page
7
of
the
record,
he
says,
“in
court,
counsel
for
petitioner
and
the
district
attorney
were
reading
the
hospital's
report.
the
petitioner
attempted
to
read
the
same
over
his
counsel
shoulder.
the
court
had
much.
petitioner
mr.
specht,
report
is
solely
for
your
counsel
and
district
attorney.
behind
this
legal
wire
certain
of
secrecy.
petitioner
was
sentence”.
that's
what
he
says
here.
and
as
mr.
bush
says,
there'd
be
no
evidentiary
hearing.
when
he
responded
to
this
in
the
federal
court,
he
didn't
say
that
so
specifically
or
that
is
so
specifically
just
said.
everything
that
isn't
admitted
is
denied.
and
that
was
his
response
to
their.
and
--
and
if
we're
going
to
go,
your
honor,
we
have
the
supreme
court
record,
that
francis
eddie
specht
put
before
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
when
he
said
this
sentence
is
unconstitutional
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
said
that's
unconstitutional
is
because
he
says
that
he
was
not
able
to
look
at
the
psychiatrist
report.
that's
in
his
brief.
and
mr.
bush,
well,
i
don't
know
if
mr.
bush
or
the
attorney
general
wrote
the
brief.
responding
to
that,
and
i
said,
on
the
petitioner's
report,
he
alleges
that
the
sentencing
procedure
denied
him
equal
protection
of
laws
and
due
process.
this
first
phase
is
for
this
attack
is
that
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
he
was
not
afforded
due
process.
this
assertion
is
apparently
based
on
a
false
premise
that
the
sentencing
must
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
trial
such
as
examination
of
the
psychiatrist
report
and
the
right
to
cross-examining
the
expert's
submitting
a
report.
we
know
of
no
principle
which
requires
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
to
the
information
upon
which
the
judge
may
properly
rely
or
utilized
in
determining
the
proper
sentence.
that's
what
the
attorney
general
said
in
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
and
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
in
their
opinion
says,
mr.
specht
several
contentions
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
are
not
properly
founded.
so,
they
clearly
said
and
he
has
said
consistently,
“i
ought
to
be
able
to
look
and
i
ought
to
know”.
and
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said,
“no,
sir”.
our
basic
point
is
that
--
mr.
michael
a.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
is
that
the
--
this
may
be
an
unlikely
response
to
sentencing.
the
legislature
has
put
some
limits
on
the
judge
and
he
said
if
you're
going
to
do
this,
we
want
to
be
sure
we've
got
the
right
guys.
we've
expressed
ourselves
in
general
and
we
say
10
years
of
indecent
liberties
but
we're
going
to
give
you
the
power
to
do
more
than
that.
there
are
some
peop
--
they've
given
standards.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said
those
are
legislative
standards;
it's
a
fact
finding
process
and
all
we
say
is
that
important.
we
are
getting
to
the
act.
we
don't
have
the
right
to
help.
make
sure
that
that
information
of
which
those
findings
are
made
is
correct
in
a
traditional
way
that
we
do
these
things
in
this
country.
