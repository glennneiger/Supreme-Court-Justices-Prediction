is
this
man
subject

earl
warren
at

time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
after

expired?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i'm
just
wondering--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
to
the
--
about
the
extent
to
which
it
could
be
used.
in
other
words,
if
he
serves
15
years
in
such
a
hospital
and
is
of
the
feeling
that
he
is
insane,
he
has
no

a
judicial
determination
of
his
sanity
and

sure
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
mr.

said
he
didn't
--
he
never
saw
the
report
of
the
doctor.
it
couldn't
have
that
there
was
one?
am
i
mistaken
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
was
it
submitted
to
the
counsel
on
an
understanding
that
it
would
not
be
eventually
defended?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
defendant
had
found
some
facts
in
there
that
he
was
satisfied
were
not
true
and
he
has
some
witnesses
who
could
have
disprove,
could
he
–
could
he
brought
them
in?
