chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
those
facts,
you
said
something
about
vick
being
a
police
officer,
was
he
a
police
officer
at
that
time
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
you
mean
the
defense
employed
a
policeman
to
investigate
the
case
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
policemen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would've
lost
what
job?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
policeman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is,
he
is
going
to
lose
his
job
as
a
policeman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
man
his
cousin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
his
cousin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
to
that,
did
the
government
pay
this
man
for
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
the
--
his
superiors
detached
him
from
other
service
to
help
the
government
in
this
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
did
his
chief
know
that
he
was
working
for
osborn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
the
chief
of
police
that
he
worked
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
let's
don't
talk
about
that.
the
ex-chief
of
police,
he
was
working
for
the
chief
of
police.
did
it
--
did
his
superiors
in
particularly,
the
chief
of
police
know
that
he
was
working
for
osborn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
that
the
chief
knew?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
the
chief
knew?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
osborn
pay
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
the
police
officer
entitled
to
report
to
the
government
if
that's
far
as
it
goes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
contend,
do
you
not
that
as
a
policeman,
he
had
the
right
to
accept
the
employment
for
a
defendant
in
a
felony
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
insist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
you
get
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
such
story?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
are
you
saying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
osborn
know
when
he
suggested
to
vick
that
he
got
in
touch
with
his
cousin
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
in
on
the
trial?
wouldn't
he
know
that
he
was
conflicting
with
his
duty
as
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
basis
of
the
entrapment
that
he
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
a
jury
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
osborn's
immediate
response
to
the
statement
of
vick
that
he
had
a
cousin
in
the
jury?
what
was
his
immediate
response?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
instruct
the
jury
on
entrapment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
instruct
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
mr.
vick
report
any
of
these
affairs
of
his
with
osborn
to
the
chief
of
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
you
have
no
--
would
the
chief
of
police
have
no
interest
in
assisting
the
government
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
he
was
doing
that
and
was
working
for
the
chief
of
police
and
the
government,
as
you
say,
he
owes
his
loyalty
to
those
who
employ
him,
why
would
his
loyalty
go
to
the
chief
of
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
counsel
concept
to
opening
up
the
case
and
showing
this
exhibit
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
even
objection
wouldn't
be
valid,
what's
the
objection
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
before
that,
it
says,
of
course,
the
court:
mr.
neil
i'm
about
to
overlook
something
here.
it's
been
called
the
court's
attention
with
just
before
the
noon
adjournment
that
some
of
the
jurors
had
not
inspected
the
certain
exhibit
and
it
has
been
read
to
them
and
i
don't
think
it
won't
require
but
a
--
just
a
few
minutes
to
let
those
jurors,
those
in
the
back
row,
i
believe
read
it.
is
that
agreeable
to
everybody?‚Äù
mr.
neil:
it
is
agreeable
to
the
government.
the
court:
we
did
say
that
we
would
afford
the
jurors
that
privilege
if
they
desire
to
see
that
affidavit.
mr.
