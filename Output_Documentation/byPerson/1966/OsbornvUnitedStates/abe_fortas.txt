justice
abe
fortas
--
in
your
previous
statement
of
the
advanced
indicates
to
me
that
you've
already
told
us
that
osborn
was
employed
by
--
i
mean,
vick
was
employed
by
osborn
prior
to
the
term
that
vick
went
to
see
mr.
whatever,
sheridan,
whatever
his
name
is.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
record,
you
say
--
and
then
you
point
to
the
record
to
the
contrary.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'd
like
to
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
june
of
'63?
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
he
see
sheridan?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kossman,
wasn't
it
--
were
these
the
judges
who's
court
processors
allegedly
were
being
--
what
shall
i
say,
corrupted
if
this
was
true?
justice
abe
fortas
and
wasn't
it
--
does
the
record
also
show,
if
i
correct
as
i
recall,
does
the
record
also
show
that
both
the
government
prosecutor,
mr.
buker
(ph),
i
think
it
was
and
the
two
judges
initially
disbelieved
mr.
vick's
report?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kossman,
was
anything
that
anybody
other
than
vick
or
osborn
said
recorded
on
this
tape?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
the
conversation
here
that
was
recorded
on
the
tape,
the
material
on
the
tape
was
a
conversation
solely
between
osborn
and
vick?
justice
abe
fortas
would
there
had
been
any
evidentiary
objection
to
vick's
testifying
as
to
that
conversation?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
this
134,
135,
is
that
the
record,
printed
record?
justice
abe
fortas
we
don't
have
that,
do
we?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
--
those
are
the
page
of
the
original
record?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
they
have
gone,
the
government
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
government
prosecutor
have
gone
to
either
judge
miller
or
judge
gray
for
a
search
warrant
to
search
osborn's
office
in
probable
cause,
would
that
also
be
constitutional
error?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
you
have
to
give
them
notice?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
to
get
a
search
warrant.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
whether
mr.
osborn
knew
that
he
was
a
police
officer?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
does
the
record
show
that
osborn
when
he
employed
vick
or
subsequently
knew
that
vick
was
a
nashville
police
officer?
justice
abe
fortas
did
petitioner's
counsel
at
the
trial
attack
the
truth
of
the
recording,
the
liability
of
what
is
on
the
recording?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
what
was
for
the
jury
to
decide
with
respect
to
the
recording
in
jury?
who
has
then
had
the
function
of
deciding
whether
it
was
lawful?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
on
entrapment
whether
the
judges
did
or
there
did
not
authorize
the
recording?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
what
the
elements
of
entrapment
are
but
what
was
a
--
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
judges
authorized
the
recording
or
whether
vick
just
went
there
entrap
or
didn't
entrap
osborn
and
then
testified?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
getting
pretty
close
to
saying
that
what
the
government
was
after
was
to
get
a
manual
of
the
judiciary
around
the
use
of
a
tape
recorder
in
the
entire
incident
and
you
don't
mean
that.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
about
that
at
the
moment.
what
i'm
asking
about
is,
what
was
the
reason
for
putting
two
federal
district
judges
on
the
witness
stand
in
a
criminal
trial?
now,
did
it
have
an
evidentiary
reason
or
was
it
merely
an
effort
by
the
government
to
lend
weight,
believability
and
force
to
its
case.
i
think
that's
the
issue
that
is
presented
here.
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
the
question
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
use
of
the
recorder,
propriety
or
impropriety
is
to
be
determined
from
the
facts
and
circumstances.
propriety
and
impropriety
are
not
perhaps,
may
i
suggest
this
to
you,
establish
by
the
fact
that
two
federal
judges
took
the
witness
stand
or
even
the
two
federal
judges
authorized
the
use
of
the
recorder.
i
mean,
the
use
of
the
recorder
is
either
proper
or
improper.
that's
apart
from
the
question
of
the
validity
of
its
authorization
or
lack
of
authorization.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
departmental
regulation,
department
of
justice
regulation
as
of
this
time
with
respect
to
certain
instances
when
tape
recording
of
this
kind
may
be
used
or
that
device
may
be
used
by
departmental
agents?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
requirement
that
the
use
of
the
tape
recorder
or
seeking
permission
to
use
a
tape
recorder
in
the
(inaudible)
hearing
of
a
witness
have
to
be
approved
by
the
attorney
general
or
anybody
else?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
whether
i
like
it
or
not
but
it's
a
question
here
as
to
whether
this
act
is
initially
the
act
of
the
department
of
justice.
i
suppose
it
was,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
the
report
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
we're
not
coming
to
the
legal
issue,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
that
mr.
sheridan
was
a
government
consultant?
is
he
a
government
officer?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
but
he
was
a
government
consultant?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
found
that
--
this
recording?
justice
abe
fortas
has
the
prosecutor
learned
of
this
statement
of
vick's
from
sheridan?
justice
abe
fortas
do
we
have
a
tape
of
this?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
get
back
to
(inaudible)
now?
this
was
a
statement
of
vick
to
someone
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
the
last
statement,
he
was
not
yet
on
mr.
osborn's
employee?
justice
abe
fortas
any
suggestion
that
he
get
into
mr.
osborn's
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
nevertheless,
while
sheridan
was
concerned.
he
understood
that
vick
would
report
anything
that
he
saw
of
illegal
nature.
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
while
he
reports
that
in,
i
thought
he's
just
going
to
report
illegal
activity?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
subsequently,
because
of
changed
of
circumstances
or
something,
mr.
sheridan
changed
the
fbi's
mind
