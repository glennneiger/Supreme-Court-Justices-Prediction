mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
represents
an
object
lesson
and
how
law
enforcement
should
not
be
carried
out.
it
involves
the
use
of
a
concealed
tape
recorder,
it
involves
entrapment,
it
involves
a
decoy
but
most
disturbing
of
all
and
perhaps
the
most
disturbing
feature
of
almost
any
case
that
i
can
recall
is
the
use
by
federal
prosecutors
of
two
federal
district
judges
to
investigate
and
to
convict
a
petitioner.
we
can
live
with
the
concealed
recording
machines.
we
can
live
with
entrapments.
we
can
live
with
decoys.
but
our
nation,
as
we
know
it,
cannot
exist
when
federal
district
judges
associate
themselves
in
the
investigative
stage
and
at
the
trial.
now
i
think
i
can
best
assist
this
court
in
first
concentrating
on
the
essential
facts
of
this
case.
and
petitioner
was
indicted
with
three
counts
of
obstructing
justice.
the
second
count,
he
was
acquitted;
the
third
count,
the
government
dropped
before
the
trial;
the
first
count
and
the
one
he
was
convicted
reads
as
follows,
“that
he
did
corruptly
endeavor
to
affect,
obstruct.”
the
next
read
as
follows
--
in
effect
be
--
just
follows
and
skip
a
little
language
and
impede
that
do
administration
of
justice
in
that
he
did
request
counsel
and
direct
robert
d.
vick,
the
contact,
ralf
a.
elliott,
vick's
cousin,
a
member
of
a
jury
panel
and
to
offer
and
to
promise
to
pay
elliott
$10,000
to
induce
--
to
set
elliott
to
vote
for
an
acquittal
if
he
should
be
selected
to
sit
on
the
jury.
who
is
this
man
vick
that
osborn
talked
to?
vick
was
an
investigator
for
osborn
back
in
1962
when
they
were
investigating
a
jury
panel
in
order
to
determine
race,
religion,
occupation.
vick
also
was
a
member
of
the
police
department,
on
the
sheriffs
department.
vick
also
did
private
investigations,
divorce
cases
and
what
not.
but
vick
in
this
case
was,
although
the
government
denies
it,
was
working
for
the
government.
when
i
say
they
deny
it,
they
say
he
was
no
agent
of
the
government.
they
displayed
an
attempt
to
repudiate
vick
even
though
they've
gotten
the
benefits
of
his
work,
i
don't
think
speaks
well
and
i
left
the
record
conclusively
prove
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
government.
in
fact
he
said
so.
now,
back
to
vick,
in
june
of
1963
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
first
words
he
said
when
they
asked
him
his
occupation
is,
“i'm
a
police.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
nothing
wrong!
that's
what
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
nothing
wrong
because
all
they
were
asking
was
statistics,
race,
religion
and
occupation.
i
mean
nothing
wrong.
he
was
a
city
policemen
that
wouldn't
be
--
and
of
course
osborn
didn't
know
the
second
time
around
that
he
was
working
for
the
government.
the
first
time
around,
he
was
simply
a
policeman.
but
there's
a
part
time,
let's
call
it
moonlighting,
that
policeman
or
deputy
sheriff
can
make
this
ordinary
investigations.
actually,
he
was
one
of
the
group
of
four
or
five
or
six
investigators.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
not
all
policemen.
but
i
think
that
the
(inaudible)
--
well,
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned,
that
he
wasn't
afraid
to
have
a
law
enforcement
officer
check
up
on
the
qualifications
of
jurors.
and
there
was
no
idle
gesture.
in
fact,
the
motions
were
filed,
denied.
court
of
appeals,
in
their
opinion,
denied
the
--
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
was
illegally
drawn,
suggesters
and
whatnot
and
indeed
this
court
refused
to
consider
one
of
the
points
when
it
came
up,
whether
the
jury
have
been
illegally
drawn.
but
he
was
a
policeman
and
that
this
is
a
little
unusual
but
nashville
is
a
small
town
and
after
all
a
policeman
would
have
more
ways
of
getting
information
than
an
ordinary
citizen,
the
same
as
the
government
use
postmasters,
when
i
say
the
government,
i'm
wrong.
same
as
the
court
use
of
postmasters
as
suggesters
even
though
--
to
pick
the
jury
even
though
they
were
close
to
the
government
on
the
ground
there
as
they
stated
in
the
record
that
postmasters
would
know
more
about
individuals
so
they
could
pick.
and
then
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
suggesters
in
picking
the
jury
panel
of
the
--
they
were
postmasters.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
was
originally
at
the
lower
level
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
we
abandoned
it
at
these
levels.
but
they
have
suggesters
who
are
postmasters.
where
they
had,
i
don't
know
in
the
light
of
the
recent
decisions,
they
have
abandoned
that.
at
any
rate,
this
vick,
rep
--
in
june
of
1963
and
the
facts
are
so
important
here
because
the
--
that
the
law
follows
automatically,
it's
very
simple
in
terms
of
entrapment
and
decoys
when
we
get
the
facts.
in
june
of
1963,
vick
reported
to
the
f.b.i.
that
he
--
this
is
very
important
than
working
all
of
the
previous
week
for
petitioner
were
now
in
1963.
mr.
osborn,
the
petitioner's
client
and
others
had
been
indicted
in
may
of
1963.
vick
reported
to
the
fbi
that
he
had
been
working
for
all
of
the
previous
week
for
petitioner
and
indicated
to
them
that
he
wished
to
cooperate
with
the
government
and
make
any
information
available
that
he
had.
now,
he
was
told,
in
all
fairness,
that
since
he
works
for
an
attorney,
who
was
representing
the
defendant
who
had
been
indicted,
they
would
not
avail
themselves
of
the
services.
vick
then
called
mr.
sheridan,
who
was
a
special
consultant
to
the
department
of
justice,
a
non-lawyer
and
i
understand
that
that
job
is
no
longer
in
existence,
and
asked
him
for
an
appointment.
sheridan
met
him
at
the
very
courthouse
that
the
petitioner
was
tried.
and
vick,
at
the
trial,
was
asked
this
question,
“you
were
afraid
you
would
lose
your
job?”
that
is
as
a
policeman.
“you
came
to
mr.
sheridan
to
give
you
a
clean
bill
of
house
and
he
said
he
would
give
it
to
you
if
you
made
these
investigations.
then
after
that,
you
went
to
mr.
osborn
to
employ
you
because
you
had
bills.
is
this
the
way
it
came
in
sequence?”
vick
answered,
“that
could
have
been
the
way
it
happened.
it
probably
was.”
now,
in
august
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
police
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
and
the
deputy
sheriffs
were
merging.
vick
was
pretending
that
he
was
going
to
lose
the
job
to
osborn
and
he
needed
money
badly,
and
he
had
bills
–
the
record
is
very
clear
there
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
as
a
policeman.
he
had
bills,
he
was
hard-up
when
he
reemployed
him
because
it's
on
the
record,
uncontradicted
that
at
that
particular
time,
osborn
did
not
employ
him
for
this
forthcoming
trial;
that
osborn's
client
that
was
scheduled
tentatively
sometime
in
fall.
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
august
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i'm
sorry
--
--
i
left
that
impression.
he
did
a
job
in
1962
then
he
stopped
working.
then
he
came
back
to
osborn
and
worked
as
i
read
that
particular
portion,
“in
june,
he
had
worked
a
week.”
then
he
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
of
'63.
mr.
jacob
kossman
he
saw
sheridan
--
and
i
was
just
coming
to
it
--
in
july
and
august
of
1963.
but
there's
a
distinction
that
vick
himself
through
all
that
time
when
they
asked
him,
“did
you
work
for
the
government?”
he
distinguished
between
government,
f.b.i.
and
mr.
sheridan.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
co
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
but
he
had
been
working
for
the
--
mr.
osborn
when
he
went
to
see
the
f.b.i.
in
other
words,
he
--
when
i
put
it
this
way,
that
particular
week
that
he
went
to
see
mr.
os
--
that
he
went
to
the
department
of
justice
in
june
of
1963
and
that's
on
the
record
251
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
just
for
a
week.
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
he
went
to
the
fbi.
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
they
didn't
want
to
have
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
he
is
no
longer
working
for
mr.
osborn.
mr.
jacob
kossman
now
he
came
to
mr.
sheridan
in
august
and
september
of
1963.
in
august
and
september
of
1963,
vick
had
several
conversations
with
sheridan,
who
is
i
think
with
the
department
of
justice,
special
consultant
and
in
charge
of
certain
investigations
in
nashville.
but
to
place
these
--
those
conversations,
narrate
in
a
shorthand
way,
vick
said
that
he
wanted
to
clean
(inaudible),
that
he
wanted
a
--
that
he
was
going
to
work
for
osborn,
and
that
he
wanted
to
turnover
any
information
that
he
could
to
the
government.
sheridan
agreed
with
these
limitations
saying
that
he
wanted
reports
only
on
illegal
activities.
and
sheridan's
own
words,
sheridan
says,
“if
you
become
aware
of
any
illegal
activities,
i
would
like
him,
meaning
vick,
to
represent
me.”
now
the
plot
thickens,
we're
now
in
september
1963,
the
middle
of
september
1963
two
months
before
the
charges
--
indictment.
in
september
of
1963,
while
vick
was
not
working
for
osborn,
vick
approached
another
nashville
lawyer,
a
mr.
wallace,
with
the
jury
list.
the
jury
list
came
out
in
the
middle
of
june
for
the
approaching
case
involving
osborn's
client.
and
he
said
to
this
lawyer
wallace
that
he
had
a
cousin
on
the
list.
and
asled
whether
this
juror
held
out
for
an
acquittal,
would
it
be
worth
$50,000
to
osborn's
client.
wallace
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
about
two
months
later,
after
osborn
has
been
disbarred
in
consequences
of
the
matter
stated
in
indictment,
vick
told
wallace
that
his
assignment
had
been
to
get
the
petitioner
and
wallace
but
that
he
had
only
gotten
the
petitioner.
but,
we're
now
in
the
middle
of
september
but
as
vick
admitted
and
that's
on
223a
and
259a
and
260,
petitioner
had
not
reemployed
him.
again,
he
went
repeatedly
to
osborn
and
begged
him
and
finally,
he
succeeded
in
being
reemployed
by
osborn
on
october
the
28th
of
1963.
now,
october
the
28th,
1963
his
agreement
had
been
with
sheridan
that
he
would
only
report
illegal
activities.
as
soon
as
vick
was
appointed
--
hired
on
october
28,
1963,
immediately
called
up
sheridan,
said,
“i
got
the
job.”
sheridan
was
in
washington.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
sheridan
was
in
washington
at
that
time.
mr.
jacob
kossman
he
was
in
washington.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i'm
sorry.
now,
this
is
important.
vick
was
given
the
last
pages
of
the
jury
list
in
judge
miller's
courtroom.
now
this
case
was
listed
for
judge
gray.
there
are
two
district
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
nashville,
tennessee,
judge
miller
and
judge
gray.
vick
was
given
the
last
pages
of
the
jury
list
in
judge
miller's
courtroom
because
the
case
was
not
assigned
to
judge
miller;
it
was
assigned
to
judge
gray,
he
gave
them
the
bottom
--
paid
the
jurors
there.
true,
there
was
a
possibility
of
all
the
jurors
that
have
been
exhausted
and
judge
gray,
they
might
have
called
someone
from
judge
miller's
jury
list.
but,
that
was
the
condition
that
mr.
vick
was
hired
and
that
becomes
very
important.
as
i
say,
vick
immediately
repaid
this
kindness
of
osborn
by
immediately
calling
up
sheridan
and
told
him
he
was
hired.
now
comes
a
stronger
point.
in
fact,
it's
so
strong
that
the
prosecution
studiously
avoids
mentioning
it
in
their
brief.
one
week
before
vick
was
employed
--
we're
now
back
on
october
the
21st.
i'm
sorry
that
i
can't
give
it
in
a
chronological
order
but
that's
the
way
the
record
shapes
up,
one
week
before
vick
was
employed
on
october
21st,
he
had
a
meeting
with
sheridan
in
nashville.
what
took
place
at
that
meeting?
we
know
thus
much
about
the
meeting.
vick
told
sheridan,
government
man,
the
special
consultant
to
the
attorney
general,
that
he
had
a
cousin
elliott
on
the
jury
list.
not
judge
miller's
list
but
on
judge
gray's
list.
now,
this
is
very
important
not
only
because
he
had
the
discussion
with
sheridan,
certainly
no
illegal
activity,
that
all
that
sheridan
said
he
wanted
to
hear,
but
because
vick
thought
it
was
so
important
because
he
testified
falsely
about
it
during
the
motion
to
suppress
and
at
the
trial.
he
was
asked,
“did
you
ever
mention
to
the
government,
to
sheridan,
to
anyone
that
vick
--
they're
talking
to
vick
--
that
you
had
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
he
said,
“no,
sir.”
question:
“no
living
human
being?”
“no,
sir.”
130a,
131a,
343a.
at
the
actual
trial,
he
was
asked
these
questions
surprisingly
on
redirect
examination
by
the
prosecutor:
“mr.
vick,
i
want
to
ask
you
just
a
very
few
questions.”
that
time
of
--
well,
i
don't
take
the
time
to
read
it,
but
he
denied,
since
i
never
mentioned
elliott
discussing
on
the
jury
to
the
government.
and
here
of
course,
as
the
records
shows
completely,
348a,
349a,
because
sheridan
put
in
the
vick's
report
that
he
had
a
discussion
with
vick
and
vick
on
october
the
21st,
one
week
before
he
went
to
work
for
osborn,
told
sheridan
of
his
cousin
who
was
on
the
jury
as
well
as
discussing
other
members
on
the
jury.
now,
vick
testified
that
the
first
time
and
of
course
the
rule
of
the
jury's
verdict
we
accept
that,
the
first
time
that
he
mentioned
elliott,
his
cousin,
to
osborn,
was
on
november
the
7th.
petition
arose
to
the
bay
and
told
vick,
to
see
elliott
and
get
him
on
our
side.
vick
said
he
would
see
elliott.
in
fact,
he
did
not
and
as
he
testified
at
the
trial
the
whole
thing
was
a
pretense,
never
had
any
intention
of
doing
it
and
he
admittedly
reported
this
conversation
of
november
the
7th
to
sheridan,
called
him
in
washington
collect.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
was
his
cousin.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
was
his
cousin
--
or
second
cousin,
as
they
say
--
a
suggestion
but
he
was
related
to
him.
it
was
reduced,
this
statement
of
osborn
to
vick
in
affidavit
form,
in
fact
the
court's
stenographer
took
the
affidavit.
and
the
prosecutors
then
took
the
affidavit
to
the
two
fed
--
to
the
federal
district
judges
and
in
their
words,
speaking
at
the
trial
of
judge
gray,
talked
into
the
prosecutor,
one
of
the
prosecutors,
because
i
was
advised
by
my
secretary
that
judge
miller
and
mr.
neil
had
been
attempting
to
attack
me.
and
you
and
mr.
neil
advised
me
that
you
did
propose
that
if
judge
miller
and
i
authorized
that
they
conduct
further
investigations
in
the
matter
to
determine
whether
it's
true
or
false
these
charges
were
made.
and
you
were
proposing
to
send
this
man
vick
back
with
the
recording
machine.
and
judge
gray
testified.
i
told
--
as
i
told
you
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
it
would
be
entirely
proper.
judge
miller
testified
when
this
matter
came
to
his
attention,
november
8th
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
by
a
person
that
he
never
knew,
he's
decided
the
best
course
to
take
was
to
allow
a
tape
recorder
to
be
used
which
will
either
clear
this
man
or
prove
he
was
guilty.
that
was
the
testimony
on
rebuttal
testimony
at
the
trial.
of
course,
there
was
a
different
judge
sitting,
two
judges
having
disqualified
themselves
in
the
gordon,
judge
boyd
from
memphis.
vick
then
have
more
conversations
with
petitioner
concerning
elliott
acting
under
the
directions
from
sheridan
who
told
them
play
this
matter
by
year.
on
november
the
11th
the
recording
was
finally
made
and
the
transcript
of
that
recording
was
immediately
shown
to
the
judges
who
had
authorized
the
carrying
of
the
recorder.
the
upshot
that
was
--
that
in
consequence,
three
separate
hearings,
petitioner
was
disbarred
and
shortly
thereafter
was
indicted,
petition
with
the
first
hearing,
denied
to
the
judge
that
when
they
asked
him
if
he
knew
anything
about
jury
tampering,
he
denied
it.
they
are
explained
out
of
the
sense
of
loyalty
to
vick
but
he
didn't
want
to
hurt
them.
not
condoning
what
he
said
at
the
recording,
session,
i'm
not
condoning
what
he
said
to
the
judge,
the
disbarment
can
be
condoned
but
neither
can
the
government's
actions
be
condoned.
the
(inaudible)
price
to
sustain
this
conviction
is
too
high.
finally,
at
the
third
meeting
he
gave
his
version
which
was
just
fancily
the
same
as
that
that
he
testified
at
the
trial.
petitioner
was
disbarred
and
shortly
thereafter
was
indicted
by
appropriate
motions
and
objections
to
suppress
to
the
mission
of
the
tape
recording
that
raises
the
first
legal
question
that
i
wish
to
discuss
here.
now,
i
recognized
that
under
the
arnely
(ph)
and
lopez
case,
the
concealed
recorder
was
admissible.
mr.
jacob
kossman
they
say
they
did
not
but
he
was,
as
he
testified,
on
special
assignment,
drawing
$350
or
$400
a
month
from
the
police
department
without
doing
a
leak
of
work
except
testifying
at
the
trial.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
record
shows
that
he
didn't
do
any
work.
when
he
was
questioned
by
defense
counsel,
“isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
chief
called
you
when
you
didn't
go
to
work
and
you
got
hold
of
sheridan
and
sheridan
says,
don't
worry
i'll
straighten
it
out.”
he
says,
no,
no
but
he
admitted
that
he
never
did
--
of
the
work
but
he
was
drawing
the
salary
and
playing
golf;
that
we
know.
but
the
government
did
not
pay
him
so
far
as
we
know
by
check
or
cash.
we
don't
know
that.
but
he
was
getting
money
from
that
police.
mr.
jacob
kossman
his
chief?
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
you
mean
during
the
particular
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
the
--
no,
was
the
ex-chief
of
police
who
had
done
some
investigations
himself
but
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
because
he
was
afraid
he'd
be
fired
on
account
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
we
find
that
in
the
record
where
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
--
where
vick
had
said
that
he
was
worried
because
coming
under
the
stigma
of
having
worked
in
the
hoffa
case,
he
would
be
fired.
so
in
that
sense
he
knew.
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
that
sense
he
knew.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i
have
no
direct
testimony
that
i
can
recall.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
record
isn't
clear
either
on
how
much
he
paid
him.
it
was
so
much
of
an
investigation.
see
there
was
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
moneys
that
he
had
paid
on
‘62.
in
terms
of
this
investigation,
it
seemed
that
he
owe
them
about
$700
or
$800
for
the
investigation
that
he
made
during
this
period
of
time
in
'63
that
he
was
reporting
to
the
government,
to
sheridan.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
question
about
it.
we
don't
say
that
--
we
don't
make
an
issue
that
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
report,
i'm
not
talking
about
betraying
attorney-client
relationship
or
anything
of
that.
we
don't
say
that
a
man
doesn't
have
a
right
to
report
something
illegal.
we
don't
say
that.
we
say
there
is
a
difference
between
reporting,
informing
and
tempting
and
beguiling
and
entrapping.
that's
the
distinction
that
we
made.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
we
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
the
case
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
when
i
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
when
i
put
it
this
way.
it
wouldn't
be
a
conflict
of
interest
because
it
would
not
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
because
this
was
a
city
policeman
and
here's
a
federal
case.
it
might
not
be
proper
as
i
can
see
in
the
circumstance.
on
the
other
hand,
all
that
he
was
looking
up
and
that
filing
reports
was
age,
occupation,
race,
religion
and
things
of
that
nature.
in
other
words,
it
wouldn't
be
that
what
he
was
looking
for
was
something
that
would
be
confidential
that
would
help
the
petitioner
that
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to.
and
he
was
i
say
one
of
the
others.
but
this
is
important
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
osborn
didn't
want
to
hire
vick.
mr.
jacob
kossman
vick
begged
for
the
employment.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
if
there's
no
question
about
it
that
spelled
out
what
osborn
said
aside
from
the
entrapment
feature
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
aside
from
the
use
of
the
concealed
recordings,
aside
from
the
interference
by
the
judges,
there's
no
question
about
it
that
what
osborn
said
to
this
particular
person
was
criminal.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
question
about
that
specially
the
carrying
on,
the
last
conversation.
now,
the
first
point
has
to
do
with
concealed
recording.
now,
i
recognized
that
under
the
on
lee
and
lopez
case,
the
concealed
recording
was
admissible.
now,
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs
some
of
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
these
cases
should
be
overruled
and
that
the
fourth
amendment,
certainly
together
with
the
fifth
amendment,
should
be
held
to
preclude
the
use
of
electronic
devices
for
the
purpose
of
securing
testimony
from
a
prospect,
of
defendant,
to
be
placed
--
played
in
the
criminal
trial.
now,
as
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
contentions
on
both
sides
on
that
tape
--
time
to
fully
repeat
it.
i
must
say
this,
the
lopez
case
was
decided
1963.
this
is
1966.
certainly,
i
guess
thomas
edison
would
be
amazed
to
see
what
has
happened
on
the
last
couple
of
years
in
terms
of
electronic
researches.
individuals
are
simply
powerless
against
electronics
snoopers.
it
has
been
stated
that
freedom
is
not
something
which
has
to
be
safeguarded
but
rather
something
which
has
to
be
extended.
now,
freedom
confined
to
the
status
quo
cannot
grow;
freedom
which
cannot
grow
withers.
now,
something
has
to
be
done.
this
court
has
the
power
aside
from
constitutional
grounds,
the
power
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
court.
prosecution
states
in
their
brief
that
this
was
an
ordinary
small
recorder.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
placed
in
a
martini
glass
or
whether
it's
place
on
the
pillow,
whether
it's
a
large
bag,
the
principle
is
the
same.
interference
with,
say
privacy,
the
principle
is
whether
third
persons
who
cannot
--
you
see
when
you're
talking
to
someone
and
he's
got
a
bug
on
you,
i
mean
you
don't
--
it's
a
little
different
than
the
olmstead
case
where
the
court
said
that
the
intention
was
to
protect
your
words
outside
of
a
room.
when
you're
talking
to
somebody
in
a
room
and
he's
bugging
you,
you
don't
even
have
that
particular
intention
aside
from
other
grounds.
but
the
chilling
of
private
conversations
is
a
--
its
well
as
a
british
cartoons
has
put
it
in
one
of
their
magazines,
he
said,
“television
isn't
killing
the
art
of
conversation;
it's
this
bugs.”
now,
the
there's
only
one
way
to
guard
against
it
and
that's
to
shut
ones
mouth.
there's
a
difference
between
this
and
talking
on
an
extension
phone
where
when
you
talk
to
someone,
they
picks
up
an
extension
phone,
you
have
a
right
to
anticipate
that
when
you
talk
to
a
--
on
a
phone
that
someone
will
listen
on
the
extension.
that's
not
the
problem
involved.
at
any
rate,
if
even
if
this
court
doesn't
wish
to
overrule
on
lee
and
lopez,
it
put
this
thing
which
lopez
on
the
ground
that
there
the
--
lopez,
when
he
talked
to
a
man,
he
knew
he
was
a
government
agent.
he
knew
he
was
a
government
agent.
here,
he
didn't
know.
that's
number
one.
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
not
working
for
the
federal
government.
furthermore,
lopez
never
contended
and
did
never
couldn't
--
that
the
tax
investigation
was
originally
intended
to
entrap
him.
it
was
lopez
who
started
the
ball
rolling
by
saying,
here's
$200
you
need
it
so
on
and
so
forth.
now,
here
you
have
a
situation
where
the
government
--
they
don't
need
to
talk
about
the
police
--
they
say
he
was
a
private
citizen
not
a
government
agent.
now,
of
course
he
wasn't
a
government
employee
in
the
sense
that
he
had
taken
the
oath
and
there
were
payroll
deductions.
he
was
working
for
the
government;
we
have
that
in
our
brief
and
he
was
an
agent
of
the
government,
much
as
they
might
look
to
repudiate
him.
now,
this
is
very
important,
if
the
court
pleases.
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
26,
to
justify
that
they
read
to
the
federal
judges
took
assistant
district
attorneys.
they
don't
go
to
the
unites
states
district
attorney:
they
went
to
the
federal
judges.
they
say
this.
it
was
plain
that
the
truth,
this
is
the
government's
brief,
could
emerge
only
if
the
government
had
an
impeachable
proof
of
the
content,
a
further
conversations
between
petitioner
and
vick.
any
other
effort
to
determine
the
facts
would
necessarily
be
beset
by
irreconcilable
conflicts.
it
was
in
these
circumstances
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
at
page
26
of
the
government's
brief.
it
was
in
these
circumstances
that
government
counsel
who
personally
disbelieved
vick's
report
sought
permission
from
the
district
judges
to
attach
a
device
to
vick's
person
and
to
record
the
next
meeting
between
petitioner
and
vick.
well,
first
of
all,
they
don't
have
to
go
to
the
federal
judges.
lopez
was
the
law.
what's
this
nonsense
to
say
that
they
had
to
go
and
get
authority
while
they
are
investing
some
--
investigating
someone
from
federal
judges
to
authorize?
the
f.b.i.
knows
how
to
investigate.
they
don't
have
to
bring
in
federal
judges.
the
two
federal
judges,
specially
one
federal
judge
who
is
in
charge
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
other
fed
--
and
the
same
federal
judge
who
is
the
trial
judge
in
the
forthcoming
trial
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
if
this
was
true,
they
would
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
what
the
record
shows
but
my
answer
is,
it's
still
does
not
justify
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
disbarment
proceeding;
i'm
talking
about
the
criminal
proceeding.
we're
concerned
with
the
criminal
proceeding
not
a
disbarment
proceeding.
and
this
case
that
they
cite
on
page
27,
united
states
versus
ventresca,
this
court
is
equally
concerned
to
uphold
the
action
of
law
enforcement
officers.
that
has
to
do
with
investigators
of
alcoholic
tax
units.
what
are
we
doing
with
federal
judges
with
prosecutors
and
investigators?
well,
at
any
rate,
now
as
i
say
i
come
to
what
is
the
most
disturbing
features
of
this
case,
the
collaboration
on
the
business
of
tracking
down
a
suspected
offender
between
the
prosecutors
and
the
one
hand
and
the
district
judges
on
the
other
hand.
if
the
telling
to
sheridan
of
the
conversation,
it
was
put
in
affidavit
form,
sheridan
then
gave
it
to
the
prosecutors
who
gave
it
to
the
judge,
who
authorized
attaching
the
recorder
for
additional
investigations.
show
me
one
case
in
the
whole
country
where
federal
judges
have
done
that.
after
which
vick,
knowing
about
the
court's
authorization,
it's
on
record
261,
even
vick
knew
that
the
court
had
authorized
it.
he
went
to
see
petitioner
again
to
confer
about
elliott
and
this
time
and
this
is
the
charge
that
he
is
indicted
for
which
is
very
--
well,
november
the
11th
not
the
first
charge,
pretending
that
he
had
seen
elliott
and
same
money
and
all
that.
of
course,
they
never
saw
him
as
he
said
he
never
had
any
intention.
now,
the
recorder
did
not
work
that
time.
it
finally
worked
on
november
the
11th
after
petitioner
had
been
thoroughly
sought
enough
of
these
conversations.
and
it
was
this
final
conversation
that
is
spread
at
length
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
now,
as
i
say,
i
don't
condone
what's
said
there.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
vick
said
to
osborn,
“my
cousin
is
on
the
jury.”
it's
most
important
to
remember
that
he'd
--
in
the
affidavit
and
the
record
speaks
for
itself
that
he
swung
into
the
conversation
about
the
jurors
of
judge
gray.
his
business
was
not
talking
about
judge
gray,
he
wasn't
to
investigate
the
jurors
on
judge
gray,
he
was
to
investigate
the
jurors
on
judge
miller.
but
as
vick
said,
i
got
into
a
conversation
about
the
jurors
in
judge
gray.
now
he
was
working
for
the
government
when
he
said
to
him,
“my
cousin
is
on
the
jury.”
that
was
not
a
job
that
mr.
osborn,
the
petitioner
hired
him.
at
any
rate
the
government
seeks
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
that's
part
of
the
basis
of
the
entrapment.
the
--
my
basis
of
entrapment
goes
further
than
that.
my
basis
on
the
entrapment
goes,
number
one,
that
when
vick
said,
“my
cousin's
on
the
jury.”
he
wasn't
giving
him
a
piece
of
information
for
the
sake
of
giving
him
information.
he
was,
as
he
himself
said,
“i've
said
it
to
him
i
wanted
to
know
what
his
intentions.”
well,
its
not
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
if
the
court
please,
we
say
as
a
matter
of
law.
it's
a
subtle
entrapment
in
contacts
with
the
entire
feature
of
it
here.
vick
on
the
october
the
21st
had
explained
to
sheridan
that
vick
was
on
the
jury
--
his
cousin.
now,
vick
also
said,
and
it's
a
matter
on
the
record
that
vick
said
that
he
had
a
conversation
with
sheridan
and
sheridan
had
said
the
only
way
they
can
win
the
case,
they
must
get
rid
of
osborn.
that
is
also
in
the
record
although
vick
said
it's
true
he
said
it
but
he
said,
“i
lied
when
i
said
it.
the
conversation
didn't
take
place.”
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
his
immediate
response
was,
“go
get
him,
see
him
on
our
side.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
man
--
that
would
--
itself
would
mean
in
plain
english
the
same,
“let's
try
to
bribe
them,
let's
try
to
obstruct
them,
let's
try
to
influence
them.”
no
question
about
that.
but,
what
meaning
did
mr.
vick
have?
it's
the
conduct
of
the
government
that's
in
question
here.
we
can
have
a
situation
where
the
government
sends
around
agents
tempting
people
in
order
that
if
they
succumb
a
case
is
to
be
made,
that's
not
the
business
of
government
agents.
and
the
government's
effort,
as
i
say
--
to
say
that
vick
is
not
a
government
agent
shows
that
they
are
conscious
of
that.
what
right
had
vick
to
say
that?
mr.
jacob
kossman
don't
forget
vick
had
told
to
wallace
in
september,
vick
had
told
another
investigator,
“polk,
i
got
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
vick
had
worked
from
october
the
28th
to
november
the
7th
and
osborn
never
told
him
to
do
something
wrong.
finally,
vick
said,
“i
got
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
who's
doing
the
entrapping?
who
is
the
bad
person?
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
court
instructed
the
jury
entrapment
but
we
say
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
instructions
if
the
court
please
were
that
--
where
the
standard
instructions
of
an
entrapment
if
you
believe
that
he
was
entrapped,
therefore,
you
could
--
you
must
find
them
not
guilty.
in
other
words,
left
the
question
of
entrapment
up
to
the
jury
but
we
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
no
government
agent
has
a
right
to
become
a
tempter,
a
serpent
to
beguile
people,
the
test
is
not
whether
he
should
have
been
strong
enough
to
resist
it.
that
he
should
have
chased
him
away.
that's
not
the
test.
the
test
cannot
be
that.
the
test
has
to
be
in
looking
at
that
particular
individual,
that
he
have
a
right
to
say
to
him,
“my
cousin
is
on
the
jury.”
well,
now
this
is
extremely
important.
the
government
on
its
brief
on
page
47
states
as
follows,
“in
his
dealings
with
petitioner,
up
to
and
including
the
crucial
date
of
november
the
7th,
vick
had
engaged
no
material
deception.”
just
think
of
this.
they
say
vick
had
engaged
no
material
deception.
here
was
vick
way
back
in
february,
reporting
to
the
--
as
of
february
1963,
when
he
was
doing
a
side
work
--
job
for
osborn
reporting
to
the
fbi,
that's
a
matter
of
record.
then
in
june,
then
in
july,
in
august,
yet
they
say
in
his
dealings
with
--
up
to
and
including
the
crucial
date
november
the
7th,
vick
had
engaged
no
material
deception.
i'm
old-fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
if
you
work
for
someone,
you
owe
him
loyalty.
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
telling
the
--
reporting
to
the
government
something
crooked.
don't
forget
up
to
november
the
7th
there
hadn't
been
anything
that
had
been
wrong.
yet,
he
was
reporting
to
the
government;
the
government
said,
“only
report
illegal
activities.”
when
he
talked
on
october
the
21st
to
sheridan,
was
that
an
illegal
activity,
the
fact
that
he
was
--
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury?
now,
the
next
thing
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
--
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
don't
know.
in
other
words,
the
chief
of
police
as
far
as
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
chief
of
the
police
must
have
had
an
interest
in
assisting
the
government
because
he
sought
to
--
that
us
--
that
vick
was
getting
paid
without
working.
so
if
i
--
we
have
to
read
into
record
that
although
it's
not
spelled
out
that
the
chief
of
the
police,
they
don't
allow
a
man
to
collect
$300
or
$400
a
month,
so
he
must
have
known
that
he
was
doing
work
for
the
government.
in
fact,
vick
so
testified
that,
“i
was
on
special
assignment.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
only
if
a
crime
had
been
committed.
mr.
jacob
kossman
only
if
a
crime
to
report
to
the
chief
of
police.
but
there
was
--
on
october
the
21st
there
was
no
crime.
why
did
he
report
to
sheridan
that
vick's
cousin
was
on
the
jury?
the
answer
is
that
this
was
the
basis
and
the
set
up
for
an
entrapment.
there
couldn't
be
any
fix
in
this
case.
the
pro
--
this
--
osborn
didn't
hire
vick
in
order
to
fix
a
juror.
vick
took
the
job
in
order
to
fix
osborn.
that's
--
the
record
spells
that
out.
he
says
so,
vick,
“i
had
never
intended
to
do
anything.
i
only
wanted
to
find
out
his
intentions.”
you
can't
go
and
set
up
people
by
finding
out
their
intentions.
well,
to
come
back
now
was
this
entrapment
business.
it
was
vick
who
was
the
first
one
who
subtly
put
very
subtle
the
idea
of
approaching
elliott
in
the
petitioner's
mind.
not
petitioner
who
originated
the
idea.
it
was
the
same
idea
that
vick
had
on
successfully
looked
to
peddle
to
mr.
wallace
back
in
september
to
another
investigator,
polk
when
he
had
mentioned
to
them
and
they
were
--
said
to
osborn,
“i'm
surprised
they
never
told
it
to
you.”
it's
on
the
same
idea
that
vick
undoubtedly
had
when
they
talked
to
sheridan
on
october
the
21st.
why
he
didn't
call
up
sheridan
and
said
--
and
say,
“i
was
hired”
if
there
wasn't
a
plan?
the
most
telling
features
of
the
plan
are
padlocked
and
to
entrap
the
petitioner
of
these.
first,
he
--
until
confronted
with
the
and
too
confronted
with
the
jencks
act
document,
sheridan's
report,
vick
twice
denied
he
ever
mentioned
elliott
to
anyone.
that
was
the
real
secret
prior
to
mentioning
elliott
to
osborn.
sheridan
said
of
his
understanding
with
vick,
an
understanding
that
was
reached
well
and
advanced
of
his
employment,
“i
want
you
to
represent
me.”
third,
if
the
vick
with
the
hard
locked
story
have
succeeded
in
getting
reemployed
by
petitioner
and
had
advised
sheridan
of
the
fact.
sheridan
said,
“don't
forget,
just
play
it
by
ear
and
continue
discussions
with
osborn
and
report
it
to
me.”
fourth,
vick
admitted,
“i
was
trying
to
find
out
what
mr.
osborn's
intentions
were
and
prove
it
make
a
case.”
fifth,
if
the
petitioner
had
been
disbarred,
vick
boasted
to
wallace
that
his
assignment
was
to
get
tommy.
now,
we
submit
that
of
november
11th
conversation
that
was
recorded
by
wick
--
vick,
which
was
sent
out
at
length
cannot
be
considered
an
isolation.
it's
a
terrible
thing
in
isolation.
it's
a
terrible
thing
taken
in
context
but
in
the
light
of
the
foregoing
facts,
we
say
we
come
under
the
sherman
case
when
petitioner
said
to
vick
the
words
on
which
this
entire
proceeding
was
premised.
they
were
the
product
of
the
creative
activity
of
law
enforcement
officials.
we
haven't
--
that's
why
i
say
we
have
a
case
of
entrapment
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
who
originated
the
idea?
mr.
jacob
kossman
nothing
that
portend
--
the
girl
said,
“hello!
how
are
you?”
this
was
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct!
mr.
jacob
kossman
none
whatsoever.
and,
we
make
none.
we
don't
make
it
an
argument
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
terms
of
vick
himself
to
be
unable
to
testify.
osborn
misplaced,
let's
put
it,
his
confidence
in
a
person.
but
that
doesn't
justify
the
use
of
recorders
or
entrapment.
now,
here
is
a
person,
the
record
is
pitiful,
here
is
a
person
who
have
left
alone
would
have
obeyed
the
law.
just
no
ifs
or
buts
about
it.
the
record
is
completely
silent
on
it.
oh,
yes,
they
bring
up
the
bird
coin.
now,
he
was
acquitted
of
that.
now,
the
government
has
seen
fit
to
print
the
direct
examination
of
beard
when
he
was
acquitted
and
they
say
it
still
has
some
value
although
he
was
acquitted.
we
say
if
he
was
acquitted,
you
cannot
use
that
as
any
evidence
of
the
predisposition
whatsoever.
now
i
made
this
mistake,
a
serious
mistake,
but
unfortunately
i
believe
i
can
correct
it.
on
the
notes
of
testimony
of
page
134
of
beard's
cross
examination
which
is
not
in
the
record
--
the
court,
by
134
beard
had
testified,
well,
that
he
would
--
that
osborn
wanted
to
give
him
ten
thousand.
he
turned
it
down
and
then
he
turned
it
down
in
a
nice
way
by
saying,
“i
want
fifty
thousand.
and
he
said
he
never
reported
this
because
“i
was
afraid
i
might
be
killed,
my
family
might
be
hurt”
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
that's
what
he
said.
acquitted.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
beard
was
an
individual
that
osborn
was
charged
with
having
contact
with
the
goal
try
to
see
the
husband
of
a
juror
in
the
second
count,
but
he
was
acquitted
of
that.
now
the
government,
however,
wants
to
make
mileage
on
the
fact
even
though
he
was
acquitted,
they
wanted
to
show
this
is
a
predisposition
in
terms
of
--
to
do
bad
things
on
the
part
of
osborn.
so
they
printed
the
direct
examination
and
i
didn't
have
enough
sense
to
print
the
cross-examination
because
i
just
didn't.
but
at
any
rate,
in
the
cross-examination
of
beard,
here
is
beard
testifying
that
they
gave
us
reason.
maybe
it
was
true,
maybe
it
was
false
according
to
the
jury
but
at
any
rate,
here
is
beard
back
again
in
1963
in
134,
135
working
for
osborn
again
and
he
receives
$60
on
june
the
12th
1963
and
in
june
the
18th,
1963.
so
there
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
the
notes
of
testimony
which
i
didn't
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
you
all
--
the
certified
copy
of
the
notes
of
testimony
would
come
up.
mr.
jacob
kossman
those
are
the
pages
of
the
original
record
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
which
i
--
the
government
printed
in
the
end
in
the
b
forum.
in
fact,
they
even
printed
things
they
didn't
have
to.
they
printed
the
grand
jury
notes.
well,
at
any
rate,
so
much
for
the
beard
thing
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
point
is
this,
the
government
is
looking
to
make
mileage
even
though
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
he
had
a
predisposition
in
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
yes,
yes.
in
other
words,
beard
had
said
on
the
stand
that
the
reason
he
didn't
report
the
so-called
approach
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
in
1962,
was
before
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
actually,
it
wasn't
this
indictment
of
which
osborn
was
acquitted,
was
a
three-count
indictment.
but
the
reason
he
gave
why
he
didn't
report
this
unlawful
act
that
he
had
said
osborn
committed
was
because
he
was
afraid
he
might
be
killed.
you
know
the
--
working
for
bad
people
and
so
on
and
so
forth
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
now
we
find
them
back
in
june
of
1963
doing
an
investigation
for
osborn
on
a
--
of
course,
this
so-called,
“do
indictment
of
(inaudible)
made
in
1963.”
that
he
made
--
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
take
the
time
up
to
explain
it
but
it's
because
the
government
put
it
in
and
the
--
and
half
the
trial
was
devoted
to
the
beard
case.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
the
government
spent
half
the
time
arguing
to
that
--
here
you
had
predisposition
and
the
judge
charged
that
you
find
that
he
was
involved
with
this
beard
thing
you
can
say
that's
a
sign,
he
was
a
bad
person
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
they
get
the
windfall
of
a
man
--
of
a
person
who
was
acquitted.
so,
therefore,
we
say
at
the
least
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
shorn
of
that
prejudicial
business
of
predisposition.
when
osborn
flatly
said,
“this
man
was
a
liar
at
the
trial.”
there'd
be
a
conviction,
i
certainly
couldn't
argue
that.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i'll
put
it
to
you,
your
honor,
i'm
only
using
it
to
answer
the
argument
that
beard
said
that
he
was
afraid
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
of
all,
he
employed
him.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
surely.
mr.
jacob
kossman
just
as
he
testified.
mr.
jacob
kossman
just
as
beard
testified.
mr.
jacob
kossman
of
course,
needless
to
say
beard
was
not
indicted
in
the
transaction.
well,
now,
i'm
coming
to
the
last
point
and
it's
this,
to
be
discussed
orally.
it's
this,
basically
it's
our
position
that
the
judges
were
not
rebuttal
witnesses
but
they
gave
opinion
testimony.
it
was
terrible.
here
are
two
federal
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
here
is
a
jury
drawn
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee,
with
all
that
we've
been
told
that
the
slightest
words
of
a
judge
how
important
it
is
that
how
the
--
and
rightly
so,
how
important
it
is
in
terms
of
affecting
the
decision
of
--
by
a
jury.
here
are
two
judges,
one
stepping
down
from
the
bench,
from
his
own
courtroom
to
sit
in
the
witness
chair
and
the
other
saying,
“i'm
now
sitting
my
courtroom”
and
they
said
in
plain
words
“osborn
was
guilty.”
they
said,
“we
wanted
to
make
this
investigation
to
find
out
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not.”
now,
it's
no
use
saying
its
rebuttal
testimony.
the
argument
wasn't
--
it's
not
rebuttal
of
anything.
the
disbarment
proceedings
and
all
that
had
been
put
in
into
the
case
during
their
case
at
chief.
why
do
they
call
the
two
federal
judges
to
testify?
in
their
brief
they
say,
“well,
you
know
that
might
have
been
hearsay
to
putting
them
in.”
maybe
it
was
but
there
was
no
objection
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
might
have
been
objections
on
other
reasons
but
there
was
no
objection.
now
worse
than
that,
they
now
take
the
affidavit
that
vick
had
written.
here's
an
affidavit,
they
think
there's
special
merit
to
that
thing
that
it's
sworn.
here's
an
affidavit
that
vick
had
sworn
to
and
they
put
that
in
evidence.
in
fact,
the
--
the
judge
interrupts
the
speech
to
the
jury
and
passes
it
by,
and
passes
it
to
the
jury
so
that
they
can
read
it.
now
why?
why
should
that
affidavit,
it's
self-supporting?
after
all
vick
had
testified.
true,
osborn
had
contradicted
vick
but
vick
didn't
take
the
stand
on
rebuttal
but
this-
its
a
different
thing.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
first
of
all,
if
they
want
to
go
to
get
a
search
warrant,
they'd
have
to
get
notice
to
mr.
osborn.
that's
one
of
the
features
involved
with
electronic
recording
machines
whether
a
search
warrant
--
they
defend
on
the
ground
that
they
were
a
little
bit
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
lo
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
when
you
come
with
the
search
warrant.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
when
you
get
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
you
bring
--
execute
is
the
correct
word,
you
bring
it
to
the
person
whose
premises
you
want
to
search,
you
have
to
tell
him.
and
that's
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
now
being
debated.
what
can
we
do
about
it?
i
say
that
our
way
of
life
comes
first
and
search
warrants
come
second.
at
any
rate,
the
government
tries
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
this
was
kind
of
a
search
warrant
because
they
went
to
tell
the
judge
about
it.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
order
what
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
just
go
do
it,
just
go
do
it,
their
own
words.
mr.
jacob
kossman
before
he
came
in
with
this
little
midget.
now,
here's
something
else,
you
see
this
is
a
--
what
bothers
me
is
this,
it's
just
a
scheme.
they
didn't
need
the
judges.
under
the
law
of
that
kind,
all
that
sheridan,
all
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
do
was
to
say
and
still
is
the
law
as
of
this
moment.
here,
here's
the
recording
machine.
in
the
lopez
case,
they
didn't
run
to
a
federal
judge.
in
the
on
lee
case,
they
run
--
didn't
run
to
a
federal
judge.
they
had
no
right
going
to
the
federal
judge
and
the
federal
judges
had
no
right
yielding
and
--
to
the
district
attorney's
ex
parte
conversations.
and
that's
something
that
this
court
in
the
supervisory
capacity
should
give
an
order
that
prosecutors
should
not
run
around
to
federal
district
judges
and
have
conversations
and
do
things
not
only
limited
to
this
expression.
now,
why
is
this
a
terrible
thing?
here
is
vick's
bad
reputation
as
a
liar.
even
the
judge
himself
at
the
trial
just
--
as
i
don't
know,
i
can't
make
out
a
tale
out
of
it
so
to
speak.
now,
here
are
federal
judges
who
were
given
opinion
testimony.
because
--
why
do
i
say
opinion
testimony?
they
said
we
wanted
to
investigate
whether
that
he
was
guilty
or
not.
we
disbarred
him.
well,
people
aren't
disbarred
for
good
conduct.
i
mean,
they
knew
he
--
they
would
disbar
because
these
judges
felt
he
was
guilty.
that's
why
the
district
attorney's
put
these
two
judges
on
the
stand.
i
don't
say
these
judges
willingly
went
on
the
stand
but
they
went
on
the
stand.
and
the
prosecutor
had
no
right
in
a
live
case
to
use,
misuse
federal
judges
for
their
purpose.
mr.
jacob
kossman
(inaudible)
instructions
just
when
they
started
to
the
speeches,
so
the
judges
reversed
themselves.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
on
page
6.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
was
an
exhibit.
just
before
mr.
buker
(ph)
started
to
talk
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
here
it
is,
page
664.
court
reopens
government's
case.
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
neil,
i'm
about
to
overlook
something,
it's
been
called
to
the
court's
attention
just
before
the
noon
adjournment.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
as
i
say
it
was
put
in
evidence
on
page
653a.
what
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
at
first
had
been
turned
down.
then,
had
been
put
an
evidence
and
in
order
to
boost
the
rock,
his
oral
statement,
even
though
there
was
no
contradiction
between
it
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
objected.
now
the
government
makes
an
argument
they
say,
“well,
we
asked
for
a
limiting
instruction.
why
don't
you
ask
preliminary
instructions?”
we
don't
--
we
came
this
for
a
limiting
instruction.
we
waived
our
right.
we
said
that's
not
rebuttal,
you
have
no
right
to
put
it
in.
the
same
is
with
the
judges.
they'd
--
their
testimony
was
not
rebuttal
of
a
thing,
just
not
rebuttal
of
a
thing.
what
did
they
testify?
they
want
to
know
whether
he
is
guilty
or
not
and
that's
why
they
prove
the
charges.
now,
the
government
comes
up
with
another
noble
argument
in
order
to
justify
judicial
intervention,
a
criminal
trial.
they
say,
well,
it's
a
question
of
credibility
and
the
judges
had
a
right
to
testify
in
order
to
show
that
it
was
credible.
what
took
place
between
osborn
and
vick?
what
did
these
judges
know
what
took
place
between
osborn
and
vick?
they
weren't
present.
they
never
even
talked
to
vick.
how
could
they
testify
to
anything
except
affidavit?
what
they
have
said
in
the
disbarment
proceedings
was
already
a
part
of
the
case
in
the
direct
thing.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
actually,
it
already
had
been
in
evidence,
if
your
honor
please,
so
therefore
an
objection
to
open
the
case
in
order
that
some
members
of
the
jury,
i
guess
hadn't
seen
this
paper,
would
not
have
been
particularly
valid.
there
had
been
an
objection
to
admitting
the
affidavit
in
evidence.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i'm
only
talking
about
the
prejudicial
effect,
how
it
was
compounded
by
the
original
admission
of
this
affidavit.
in
other
words,
the
objection
was
--
here
is
page
653a,
“do
you
have
any
objection?”
mr.
norman
took
an
exception
and
they
read
the
exhibit
17.
so,
therefore,
he
had
objected
to
it.
now,
mr.
buker
(ph)
on
page
655a
said,
“we
would
like
to
pass
this,
if
your
honor
please,
this
document
of
the
jury.”
and
it
says
here
in
parenthesis,
exhibit
passed
to
the
jury
for
examination.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
mean,
which
page
are
you
reading
from,
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
kossman
655a?
mr.
jacob
kossman
corrected.
if
the
court
please,
mr.
buker
(ph)
we
would
like
to
pass
this,
if
your
honor,
please.
now
on
653a,
mr.
norman
was
objecting
to
this.
mr.
norman
is
objecting
to
this
on
page
653a.
now,
mr.
norman
then
says
--
this
is
conversations
here
with
a
judge
--
entrapment,
i
mean,
the
exhibit
already
had
gone
in.
653a.
mr.
jacob
kossman
do
i
make
myself
clear
then?
mr.
jacob
kossman
on
what
page?
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
664
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
well,
off
course,
don't
you
--
you're
correct
your
honor
but
at
that
time
already
it
had
been
admitted
into
evidence
on
page
60
--
53a
over
the
objection
as
to
this
business
of
allowing
the
two
jurors
to
see
it,
who
had
missed
seeing
it.
mr.
norman
did
not
object
to
that.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
mean,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
make
it
clear
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
in
that
sense.
well,
we
simply
say
this
wasn't
rebuttal.
it
can't
be
justified
even
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
in
fact
we
say
this,
even
if
this
was
rebuttal
in
the
case
of
the
government's
side,
it
is
in
our
side,
not
the
--
even
if
it
was
rebuttal,
it
would
be
objectionable
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
have
allowed
that
testimony
by
two
federal
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
who
had
disbarred
the
petitioner
to
testify,
that
they
authorized
these
proceedings
to
know
whether
he
is
guilty
or
not.
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
i
have
two
minutes?
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
justice
clark,
on
page
653-a,
vick
states,
“on
october
28,
1963,
osborn
asked
me
if
would
have
take
employment.
i
telephonically
communicated
this
fact
to
walter
b.
sheridan.”
that's
to
be
found
on
page
653-a.
certainly,
not
on
the
legal
activity
that
he
was
reporting
to
sheridan.
now,
but
more
important
on
page
383-a,
there
was
evidence
in
the
government's
case
in
chief
of
the
authorization.
judge,
they
read
government
exhibit
13,
14
and
15.
on
friday,
november
the
8th
1963,
judge
miller
and
i
individually
were
presented
with
an
affidavit.
this
is
being
read
to
the
jury,
with
mr.
neil
taking
the
part
of
judge
miller
and
mr.
hooker
taking
the
part
of
judge
gray
and
they
begun
reading
the
transcript
and
according
to
the
affidavit,
we
individually
and
i
supposed
concurrently
authorized
further
investigations
of
the
matter.
so,
as
far
as
the
jury
was
concerned,
as
far
as
the
case
was
concerned,
the
jury
knew
that
these
two
judges
have
authorized.
so,
therefore,
when
we
say
there
isn't
rebuttal
of
that
thing,
there
isn't
rebuttal
of
that
thing.
now,
this
business
of
discussing
to
juror
elliot
with
anybody
before
you
took
to
osborn,
the
record
was
clear
that
vick
tried
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
had
discussed
it,
perfectly
here
on
page
138.
question:
“had
you
discussed
that
juror
eliot
with
anybody
before
you
talk
to
mr.
osborn
about
it?”
“no,
sir.”
“no
living
human
being?”
and
the
two
prosecutors
were
sitting
there
when
he
was
making
those
statements
and
they
did
not
object
to
say
anything
about
it
even
though
they
knew
it
wasn't
so.
and
finally,
even
though
in
the
re-direct
examination,
if
the
trial
he
says
this
question,
“have
you
discussed
with
anybody
connected
with
the
government",
vick
has
asked
this
question,
the
matter
of
going
to
see
elliot,
of
elliot
being
kin
to
you
or
you
being
close
to
him,
anything
of
that
sort?”
and
then
comes
up
the
junk
statement
on
october
the
21st
which
shows
it.
thank
you.
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
represents
an
object
lesson
and
how
law
enforcement
should
not
be
carried
out.
it
involves
the
use
of
a
concealed
tape
recorder,
it
involves
entrapment,
it
involves
a
decoy
but
most
disturbing
of
all
and
perhaps
the
most
disturbing
feature
of
almost
any
case
that
i
can
recall
is
the
use
by
federal
prosecutors
of
two
federal
district
judges
to
investigate
and
to
convict
a
petitioner.
we
can
live
with
the
concealed
recording
machines.
we
can
live
with
entrapments.
we
can
live
with
decoys.
but
our
nation,
as
we
know
it,
cannot
exist
when
federal
district
judges
associate
themselves
in
the
investigative
stage
and
at
the
trial.
now
i
think
i
can
best
assist
this
court
in
first
concentrating
on
the
essential
facts
of
this
case.
and
petitioner
was
indicted
with
three
counts
of
obstructing
justice.
the
second
count,
he
was
acquitted;
the
third
count,
the
government
dropped
before
the
trial;
the
first
count
and
the
one
he
was
convicted
reads
as
follows,
“that
he
did
corruptly
endeavor
to
affect,
obstruct.”
the
next
read
as
follows
--
in
effect
be
--
just
follows
and
skip
a
little
language
and
impede
that
do
administration
of
justice
in
that
he
did
request
counsel
and
direct
robert
d.
vick,
the
contact,
ralf
a.
elliott,
vick's
cousin,
a
member
of
a
jury
panel
and
to
offer
and
to
promise
to
pay
elliott
$10,000
to
induce
--
to
set
elliott
to
vote
for
an
acquittal
if
he
should
be
selected
to
sit
on
the
jury.
who
is
this
man
vick
that
osborn
talked
to?
vick
was
an
investigator
for
osborn
back
in
1962
when
they
were
investigating
a
jury
panel
in
order
to
determine
race,
religion,
occupation.
vick
also
was
a
member
of
the
police
department,
on
the
sheriffs
department.
vick
also
did
private
investigations,
divorce
cases
and
what
not.
but
vick
in
this
case
was,
although
the
government
denies
it,
was
working
for
the
government.
when
i
say
they
deny
it,
they
say
he
was
no
agent
of
the
government.
they
displayed
an
attempt
to
repudiate
vick
even
though
they've
gotten
the
benefits
of
his
work,
i
don't
think
speaks
well
and
i
left
the
record
conclusively
prove
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
government.
in
fact
he
said
so.
now,
back
to
vick,
in
june
of
1963
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
first
words
he
said
when
they
asked
him
his
occupation
is,
“i'm
a
police.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
nothing
wrong!
that's
what
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
nothing
wrong
because
all
they
were
asking
was
statistics,
race,
religion
and
occupation.
i
mean
nothing
wrong.
he
was
a
city
policemen
that
wouldn't
be
--
and
of
course
osborn
didn't
know
the
second
time
around
that
he
was
working
for
the
government.
the
first
time
around,
he
was
simply
a
policeman.
but
there's
a
part
time,
let's
call
it
moonlighting,
that
policeman
or
deputy
sheriff
can
make
this
ordinary
investigations.
actually,
he
was
one
of
the
group
of
four
or
five
or
six
investigators.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
not
all
policemen.
but
i
think
that
the
(inaudible)
--
well,
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned,
that
he
wasn't
afraid
to
have
a
law
enforcement
officer
check
up
on
the
qualifications
of
jurors.
and
there
was
no
idle
gesture.
in
fact,
the
motions
were
filed,
denied.
court
of
appeals,
in
their
opinion,
denied
the
--
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
was
illegally
drawn,
suggesters
and
whatnot
and
indeed
this
court
refused
to
consider
one
of
the
points
when
it
came
up,
whether
the
jury
have
been
illegally
drawn.
but
he
was
a
policeman
and
that
this
is
a
little
unusual
but
nashville
is
a
small
town
and
after
all
a
policeman
would
have
more
ways
of
getting
information
than
an
ordinary
citizen,
the
same
as
the
government
use
postmasters,
when
i
say
the
government,
i'm
wrong.
same
as
the
court
use
of
postmasters
as
suggesters
even
though
--
to
pick
the
jury
even
though
they
were
close
to
the
government
on
the
ground
there
as
they
stated
in
the
record
that
postmasters
would
know
more
about
individuals
so
they
could
pick.
and
then
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
suggesters
in
picking
the
jury
panel
of
the
--
they
were
postmasters.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
was
originally
at
the
lower
level
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
we
abandoned
it
at
these
levels.
but
they
have
suggesters
who
are
postmasters.
where
they
had,
i
don't
know
in
the
light
of
the
recent
decisions,
they
have
abandoned
that.
at
any
rate,
this
vick,
rep
--
in
june
of
1963
and
the
facts
are
so
important
here
because
the
--
that
the
law
follows
automatically,
it's
very
simple
in
terms
of
entrapment
and
decoys
when
we
get
the
facts.
in
june
of
1963,
vick
reported
to
the
f.b.i.
that
he
--
this
is
very
important
than
working
all
of
the
previous
week
for
petitioner
were
now
in
1963.
mr.
osborn,
the
petitioner's
client
and
others
had
been
indicted
in
may
of
1963.
vick
reported
to
the
fbi
that
he
had
been
working
for
all
of
the
previous
week
for
petitioner
and
indicated
to
them
that
he
wished
to
cooperate
with
the
government
and
make
any
information
available
that
he
had.
now,
he
was
told,
in
all
fairness,
that
since
he
works
for
an
attorney,
who
was
representing
the
defendant
who
had
been
indicted,
they
would
not
avail
themselves
of
the
services.
vick
then
called
mr.
sheridan,
who
was
a
special
consultant
to
the
department
of
justice,
a
non-lawyer
and
i
understand
that
that
job
is
no
longer
in
existence,
and
asked
him
for
an
appointment.
sheridan
met
him
at
the
very
courthouse
that
the
petitioner
was
tried.
and
vick,
at
the
trial,
was
asked
this
question,
“you
were
afraid
you
would
lose
your
job?”
that
is
as
a
policeman.
“you
came
to
mr.
sheridan
to
give
you
a
clean
bill
of
house
and
he
said
he
would
give
it
to
you
if
you
made
these
investigations.
then
after
that,
you
went
to
mr.
osborn
to
employ
you
because
you
had
bills.
is
this
the
way
it
came
in
sequence?”
vick
answered,
“that
could
have
been
the
way
it
happened.
it
probably
was.”
now,
in
august
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
police
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
and
the
deputy
sheriffs
were
merging.
vick
was
pretending
that
he
was
going
to
lose
the
job
to
osborn
and
he
needed
money
badly,
and
he
had
bills
–
the
record
is
very
clear
there
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
as
a
policeman.
he
had
bills,
he
was
hard-up
when
he
reemployed
him
because
it's
on
the
record,
uncontradicted
that
at
that
particular
time,
osborn
did
not
employ
him
for
this
forthcoming
trial;
that
osborn's
client
that
was
scheduled
tentatively
sometime
in
fall.
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
august
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i'm
sorry
--
--
i
left
that
impression.
he
did
a
job
in
1962
then
he
stopped
working.
then
he
came
back
to
osborn
and
worked
as
i
read
that
particular
portion,
“in
june,
he
had
worked
a
week.”
then
he
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
of
'63.
mr.
jacob
kossman
he
saw
sheridan
--
and
i
was
just
coming
to
it
--
in
july
and
august
of
1963.
but
there's
a
distinction
that
vick
himself
through
all
that
time
when
they
asked
him,
“did
you
work
for
the
government?”
he
distinguished
between
government,
f.b.i.
and
mr.
sheridan.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
co
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
but
he
had
been
working
for
the
--
mr.
osborn
when
he
went
to
see
the
f.b.i.
in
other
words,
he
--
when
i
put
it
this
way,
that
particular
week
that
he
went
to
see
mr.
os
--
that
he
went
to
the
department
of
justice
in
june
of
1963
and
that's
on
the
record
251
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
just
for
a
week.
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
he
went
to
the
fbi.
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
they
didn't
want
to
have
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
he
is
no
longer
working
for
mr.
osborn.
mr.
jacob
kossman
now
he
came
to
mr.
sheridan
in
august
and
september
of
1963.
in
august
and
september
of
1963,
vick
had
several
conversations
with
sheridan,
who
is
i
think
with
the
department
of
justice,
special
consultant
and
in
charge
of
certain
investigations
in
nashville.
but
to
place
these
--
those
conversations,
narrate
in
a
shorthand
way,
vick
said
that
he
wanted
to
clean
(inaudible),
that
he
wanted
a
--
that
he
was
going
to
work
for
osborn,
and
that
he
wanted
to
turnover
any
information
that
he
could
to
the
government.
sheridan
agreed
with
these
limitations
saying
that
he
wanted
reports
only
on
illegal
activities.
and
sheridan's
own
words,
sheridan
says,
“if
you
become
aware
of
any
illegal
activities,
i
would
like
him,
meaning
vick,
to
represent
me.”
now
the
plot
thickens,
we're
now
in
september
1963,
the
middle
of
september
1963
two
months
before
the
charges
--
indictment.
in
september
of
1963,
while
vick
was
not
working
for
osborn,
vick
approached
another
nashville
lawyer,
a
mr.
wallace,
with
the
jury
list.
the
jury
list
came
out
in
the
middle
of
june
for
the
approaching
case
involving
osborn's
client.
and
he
said
to
this
lawyer
wallace
that
he
had
a
cousin
on
the
list.
and
asled
whether
this
juror
held
out
for
an
acquittal,
would
it
be
worth
$50,000
to
osborn's
client.
wallace
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
about
two
months
later,
after
osborn
has
been
disbarred
in
consequences
of
the
matter
stated
in
indictment,
vick
told
wallace
that
his
assignment
had
been
to
get
the
petitioner
and
wallace
but
that
he
had
only
gotten
the
petitioner.
but,
we're
now
in
the
middle
of
september
but
as
vick
admitted
and
that's
on
223a
and
259a
and
260,
petitioner
had
not
reemployed
him.
again,
he
went
repeatedly
to
osborn
and
begged
him
and
finally,
he
succeeded
in
being
reemployed
by
osborn
on
october
the
28th
of
1963.
now,
october
the
28th,
1963
his
agreement
had
been
with
sheridan
that
he
would
only
report
illegal
activities.
as
soon
as
vick
was
appointed
--
hired
on
october
28,
1963,
immediately
called
up
sheridan,
said,
“i
got
the
job.”
sheridan
was
in
washington.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
sheridan
was
in
washington
at
that
time.
mr.
jacob
kossman
he
was
in
washington.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i'm
sorry.
now,
this
is
important.
vick
was
given
the
last
pages
of
the
jury
list
in
judge
miller's
courtroom.
now
this
case
was
listed
for
judge
gray.
there
are
two
district
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
nashville,
tennessee,
judge
miller
and
judge
gray.
vick
was
given
the
last
pages
of
the
jury
list
in
judge
miller's
courtroom
because
the
case
was
not
assigned
to
judge
miller;
it
was
assigned
to
judge
gray,
he
gave
them
the
bottom
--
paid
the
jurors
there.
true,
there
was
a
possibility
of
all
the
jurors
that
have
been
exhausted
and
judge
gray,
they
might
have
called
someone
from
judge
miller's
jury
list.
but,
that
was
the
condition
that
mr.
vick
was
hired
and
that
becomes
very
important.
as
i
say,
vick
immediately
repaid
this
kindness
of
osborn
by
immediately
calling
up
sheridan
and
told
him
he
was
hired.
now
comes
a
stronger
point.
in
fact,
it's
so
strong
that
the
prosecution
studiously
avoids
mentioning
it
in
their
brief.
one
week
before
vick
was
employed
--
we're
now
back
on
october
the
21st.
i'm
sorry
that
i
can't
give
it
in
a
chronological
order
but
that's
the
way
the
record
shapes
up,
one
week
before
vick
was
employed
on
october
21st,
he
had
a
meeting
with
sheridan
in
nashville.
what
took
place
at
that
meeting?
we
know
thus
much
about
the
meeting.
vick
told
sheridan,
government
man,
the
special
consultant
to
the
attorney
general,
that
he
had
a
cousin
elliott
on
the
jury
list.
not
judge
miller's
list
but
on
judge
gray's
list.
now,
this
is
very
important
not
only
because
he
had
the
discussion
with
sheridan,
certainly
no
illegal
activity,
that
all
that
sheridan
said
he
wanted
to
hear,
but
because
vick
thought
it
was
so
important
because
he
testified
falsely
about
it
during
the
motion
to
suppress
and
at
the
trial.
he
was
asked,
“did
you
ever
mention
to
the
government,
to
sheridan,
to
anyone
that
vick
--
they're
talking
to
vick
--
that
you
had
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
he
said,
“no,
sir.”
question:
“no
living
human
being?”
“no,
sir.”
130a,
131a,
343a.
at
the
actual
trial,
he
was
asked
these
questions
surprisingly
on
redirect
examination
by
the
prosecutor:
“mr.
vick,
i
want
to
ask
you
just
a
very
few
questions.”
that
time
of
--
well,
i
don't
take
the
time
to
read
it,
but
he
denied,
since
i
never
mentioned
elliott
discussing
on
the
jury
to
the
government.
and
here
of
course,
as
the
records
shows
completely,
348a,
349a,
because
sheridan
put
in
the
vick's
report
that
he
had
a
discussion
with
vick
and
vick
on
october
the
21st,
one
week
before
he
went
to
work
for
osborn,
told
sheridan
of
his
cousin
who
was
on
the
jury
as
well
as
discussing
other
members
on
the
jury.
now,
vick
testified
that
the
first
time
and
of
course
the
rule
of
the
jury's
verdict
we
accept
that,
the
first
time
that
he
mentioned
elliott,
his
cousin,
to
osborn,
was
on
november
the
7th.
petition
arose
to
the
bay
and
told
vick,
to
see
elliott
and
get
him
on
our
side.
vick
said
he
would
see
elliott.
in
fact,
he
did
not
and
as
he
testified
at
the
trial
the
whole
thing
was
a
pretense,
never
had
any
intention
of
doing
it
and
he
admittedly
reported
this
conversation
of
november
the
7th
to
sheridan,
called
him
in
washington
collect.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
was
his
cousin.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
was
his
cousin
--
or
second
cousin,
as
they
say
--
a
suggestion
but
he
was
related
to
him.
it
was
reduced,
this
statement
of
osborn
to
vick
in
affidavit
form,
in
fact
the
court's
stenographer
took
the
affidavit.
and
the
prosecutors
then
took
the
affidavit
to
the
two
fed
--
to
the
federal
district
judges
and
in
their
words,
speaking
at
the
trial
of
judge
gray,
talked
into
the
prosecutor,
one
of
the
prosecutors,
because
i
was
advised
by
my
secretary
that
judge
miller
and
mr.
neil
had
been
attempting
to
attack
me.
and
you
and
mr.
neil
advised
me
that
you
did
propose
that
if
judge
miller
and
i
authorized
that
they
conduct
further
investigations
in
the
matter
to
determine
whether
it's
true
or
false
these
charges
were
made.
and
you
were
proposing
to
send
this
man
vick
back
with
the
recording
machine.
and
judge
gray
testified.
i
told
--
as
i
told
you
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
it
would
be
entirely
proper.
judge
miller
testified
when
this
matter
came
to
his
attention,
november
8th
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
by
a
person
that
he
never
knew,
he's
decided
the
best
course
to
take
was
to
allow
a
tape
recorder
to
be
used
which
will
either
clear
this
man
or
prove
he
was
guilty.
that
was
the
testimony
on
rebuttal
testimony
at
the
trial.
of
course,
there
was
a
different
judge
sitting,
two
judges
having
disqualified
themselves
in
the
gordon,
judge
boyd
from
memphis.
vick
then
have
more
conversations
with
petitioner
concerning
elliott
acting
under
the
directions
from
sheridan
who
told
them
play
this
matter
by
year.
on
november
the
11th
the
recording
was
finally
made
and
the
transcript
of
that
recording
was
immediately
shown
to
the
judges
who
had
authorized
the
carrying
of
the
recorder.
the
upshot
that
was
--
that
in
consequence,
three
separate
hearings,
petitioner
was
disbarred
and
shortly
thereafter
was
indicted,
petition
with
the
first
hearing,
denied
to
the
judge
that
when
they
asked
him
if
he
knew
anything
about
jury
tampering,
he
denied
it.
they
are
explained
out
of
the
sense
of
loyalty
to
vick
but
he
didn't
want
to
hurt
them.
not
condoning
what
he
said
at
the
recording,
session,
i'm
not
condoning
what
he
said
to
the
judge,
the
disbarment
can
be
condoned
but
neither
can
the
government's
actions
be
condoned.
the
(inaudible)
price
to
sustain
this
conviction
is
too
high.
finally,
at
the
third
meeting
he
gave
his
version
which
was
just
fancily
the
same
as
that
that
he
testified
at
the
trial.
petitioner
was
disbarred
and
shortly
thereafter
was
indicted
by
appropriate
motions
and
objections
to
suppress
to
the
mission
of
the
tape
recording
that
raises
the
first
legal
question
that
i
wish
to
discuss
here.
now,
i
recognized
that
under
the
arnely
(ph)
and
lopez
case,
the
concealed
recorder
was
admissible.
mr.
jacob
kossman
they
say
they
did
not
but
he
was,
as
he
testified,
on
special
assignment,
drawing
$350
or
$400
a
month
from
the
police
department
without
doing
a
leak
of
work
except
testifying
at
the
trial.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
record
shows
that
he
didn't
do
any
work.
when
he
was
questioned
by
defense
counsel,
“isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
chief
called
you
when
you
didn't
go
to
work
and
you
got
hold
of
sheridan
and
sheridan
says,
don't
worry
i'll
straighten
it
out.”
he
says,
no,
no
but
he
admitted
that
he
never
did
--
of
the
work
but
he
was
drawing
the
salary
and
playing
golf;
that
we
know.
but
the
government
did
not
pay
him
so
far
as
we
know
by
check
or
cash.
we
don't
know
that.
but
he
was
getting
money
from
that
police.
mr.
jacob
kossman
his
chief?
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
you
mean
during
the
particular
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
the
--
no,
was
the
ex-chief
of
police
who
had
done
some
investigations
himself
but
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
because
he
was
afraid
he'd
be
fired
on
account
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
we
find
that
in
the
record
where
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
--
where
vick
had
said
that
he
was
worried
because
coming
under
the
stigma
of
having
worked
in
the
hoffa
case,
he
would
be
fired.
so
in
that
sense
he
knew.
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
that
sense
he
knew.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i
have
no
direct
testimony
that
i
can
recall.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
record
isn't
clear
either
on
how
much
he
paid
him.
it
was
so
much
of
an
investigation.
see
there
was
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
moneys
that
he
had
paid
on
‘62.
in
terms
of
this
investigation,
it
seemed
that
he
owe
them
about
$700
or
$800
for
the
investigation
that
he
made
during
this
period
of
time
in
'63
that
he
was
reporting
to
the
government,
to
sheridan.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
question
about
it.
we
don't
say
that
--
we
don't
make
an
issue
that
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
report,
i'm
not
talking
about
betraying
attorney-client
relationship
or
anything
of
that.
we
don't
say
that
a
man
doesn't
have
a
right
to
report
something
illegal.
we
don't
say
that.
we
say
there
is
a
difference
between
reporting,
informing
and
tempting
and
beguiling
and
entrapping.
that's
the
distinction
that
we
made.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
we
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
the
case
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
when
i
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
when
i
put
it
this
way.
it
wouldn't
be
a
conflict
of
interest
because
it
would
not
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
because
this
was
a
city
policeman
and
here's
a
federal
case.
it
might
not
be
proper
as
i
can
see
in
the
circumstance.
on
the
other
hand,
all
that
he
was
looking
up
and
that
filing
reports
was
age,
occupation,
race,
religion
and
things
of
that
nature.
in
other
words,
it
wouldn't
be
that
what
he
was
looking
for
was
something
that
would
be
confidential
that
would
help
the
petitioner
that
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to.
and
he
was
i
say
one
of
the
others.
but
this
is
important
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
osborn
didn't
want
to
hire
vick.
mr.
jacob
kossman
vick
begged
for
the
employment.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
if
there's
no
question
about
it
that
spelled
out
what
osborn
said
aside
from
the
entrapment
feature
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
aside
from
the
use
of
the
concealed
recordings,
aside
from
the
interference
by
the
judges,
there's
no
question
about
it
that
what
osborn
said
to
this
particular
person
was
criminal.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
question
about
that
specially
the
carrying
on,
the
last
conversation.
now,
the
first
point
has
to
do
with
concealed
recording.
now,
i
recognized
that
under
the
on
lee
and
lopez
case,
the
concealed
recording
was
admissible.
now,
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs
some
of
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
these
cases
should
be
overruled
and
that
the
fourth
amendment,
certainly
together
with
the
fifth
amendment,
should
be
held
to
preclude
the
use
of
electronic
devices
for
the
purpose
of
securing
testimony
from
a
prospect,
of
defendant,
to
be
placed
--
played
in
the
criminal
trial.
now,
as
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
contentions
on
both
sides
on
that
tape
--
time
to
fully
repeat
it.
i
must
say
this,
the
lopez
case
was
decided
1963.
this
is
1966.
certainly,
i
guess
thomas
edison
would
be
amazed
to
see
what
has
happened
on
the
last
couple
of
years
in
terms
of
electronic
researches.
individuals
are
simply
powerless
against
electronics
snoopers.
it
has
been
stated
that
freedom
is
not
something
which
has
to
be
safeguarded
but
rather
something
which
has
to
be
extended.
now,
freedom
confined
to
the
status
quo
cannot
grow;
freedom
which
cannot
grow
withers.
now,
something
has
to
be
done.
this
court
has
the
power
aside
from
constitutional
grounds,
the
power
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
court.
prosecution
states
in
their
brief
that
this
was
an
ordinary
small
recorder.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
placed
in
a
martini
glass
or
whether
it's
place
on
the
pillow,
whether
it's
a
large
bag,
the
principle
is
the
same.
interference
with,
say
privacy,
the
principle
is
whether
third
persons
who
cannot
--
you
see
when
you're
talking
to
someone
and
he's
got
a
bug
on
you,
i
mean
you
don't
--
it's
a
little
different
than
the
olmstead
case
where
the
court
said
that
the
intention
was
to
protect
your
words
outside
of
a
room.
when
you're
talking
to
somebody
in
a
room
and
he's
bugging
you,
you
don't
even
have
that
particular
intention
aside
from
other
grounds.
but
the
chilling
of
private
conversations
is
a
--
its
well
as
a
british
cartoons
has
put
it
in
one
of
their
magazines,
he
said,
“television
isn't
killing
the
art
of
conversation;
it's
this
bugs.”
now,
the
there's
only
one
way
to
guard
against
it
and
that's
to
shut
ones
mouth.
there's
a
difference
between
this
and
talking
on
an
extension
phone
where
when
you
talk
to
someone,
they
picks
up
an
extension
phone,
you
have
a
right
to
anticipate
that
when
you
talk
to
a
--
on
a
phone
that
someone
will
listen
on
the
extension.
that's
not
the
problem
involved.
at
any
rate,
if
even
if
this
court
doesn't
wish
to
overrule
on
lee
and
lopez,
it
put
this
thing
which
lopez
on
the
ground
that
there
the
--
lopez,
when
he
talked
to
a
man,
he
knew
he
was
a
government
agent.
he
knew
he
was
a
government
agent.
here,
he
didn't
know.
that's
number
one.
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
not
working
for
the
federal
government.
furthermore,
lopez
never
contended
and
did
never
couldn't
--
that
the
tax
investigation
was
originally
intended
to
entrap
him.
it
was
lopez
who
started
the
ball
rolling
by
saying,
here's
$200
you
need
it
so
on
and
so
forth.
now,
here
you
have
a
situation
where
the
government
--
they
don't
need
to
talk
about
the
police
--
they
say
he
was
a
private
citizen
not
a
government
agent.
now,
of
course
he
wasn't
a
government
employee
in
the
sense
that
he
had
taken
the
oath
and
there
were
payroll
deductions.
he
was
working
for
the
government;
we
have
that
in
our
brief
and
he
was
an
agent
of
the
government,
much
as
they
might
look
to
repudiate
him.
now,
this
is
very
important,
if
the
court
pleases.
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
26,
to
justify
that
they
read
to
the
federal
judges
took
assistant
district
attorneys.
they
don't
go
to
the
unites
states
district
attorney:
they
went
to
the
federal
judges.
they
say
this.
it
was
plain
that
the
truth,
this
is
the
government's
brief,
could
emerge
only
if
the
government
had
an
impeachable
proof
of
the
content,
a
further
conversations
between
petitioner
and
vick.
any
other
effort
to
determine
the
facts
would
necessarily
be
beset
by
irreconcilable
conflicts.
it
was
in
these
circumstances
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
at
page
26
of
the
government's
brief.
it
was
in
these
circumstances
that
government
counsel
who
personally
disbelieved
vick's
report
sought
permission
from
the
district
judges
to
attach
a
device
to
vick's
person
and
to
record
the
next
meeting
between
petitioner
and
vick.
well,
first
of
all,
they
don't
have
to
go
to
the
federal
judges.
lopez
was
the
law.
what's
this
nonsense
to
say
that
they
had
to
go
and
get
authority
while
they
are
investing
some
--
investigating
someone
from
federal
judges
to
authorize?
the
f.b.i.
knows
how
to
investigate.
they
don't
have
to
bring
in
federal
judges.
the
two
federal
judges,
specially
one
federal
judge
who
is
in
charge
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
other
fed
--
and
the
same
federal
judge
who
is
the
trial
judge
in
the
forthcoming
trial
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
if
this
was
true,
they
would
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
what
the
record
shows
but
my
answer
is,
it's
still
does
not
justify
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
disbarment
proceeding;
i'm
talking
about
the
criminal
proceeding.
we're
concerned
with
the
criminal
proceeding
not
a
disbarment
proceeding.
and
this
case
that
they
cite
on
page
27,
united
states
versus
ventresca,
this
court
is
equally
concerned
to
uphold
the
action
of
law
enforcement
officers.
that
has
to
do
with
investigators
of
alcoholic
tax
units.
what
are
we
doing
with
federal
judges
with
prosecutors
and
investigators?
well,
at
any
rate,
now
as
i
say
i
come
to
what
is
the
most
disturbing
features
of
this
case,
the
collaboration
on
the
business
of
tracking
down
a
suspected
offender
between
the
prosecutors
and
the
one
hand
and
the
district
judges
on
the
other
hand.
if
the
telling
to
sheridan
of
the
conversation,
it
was
put
in
affidavit
form,
sheridan
then
gave
it
to
the
prosecutors
who
gave
it
to
the
judge,
who
authorized
attaching
the
recorder
for
additional
investigations.
show
me
one
case
in
the
whole
country
where
federal
judges
have
done
that.
after
which
vick,
knowing
about
the
court's
authorization,
it's
on
record
261,
even
vick
knew
that
the
court
had
authorized
it.
he
went
to
see
petitioner
again
to
confer
about
elliott
and
this
time
and
this
is
the
charge
that
he
is
indicted
for
which
is
very
--
well,
november
the
11th
not
the
first
charge,
pretending
that
he
had
seen
elliott
and
same
money
and
all
that.
of
course,
they
never
saw
him
as
he
said
he
never
had
any
intention.
now,
the
recorder
did
not
work
that
time.
it
finally
worked
on
november
the
11th
after
petitioner
had
been
thoroughly
sought
enough
of
these
conversations.
and
it
was
this
final
conversation
that
is
spread
at
length
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
now,
as
i
say,
i
don't
condone
what's
said
there.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
vick
said
to
osborn,
“my
cousin
is
on
the
jury.”
it's
most
important
to
remember
that
he'd
--
in
the
affidavit
and
the
record
speaks
for
itself
that
he
swung
into
the
conversation
about
the
jurors
of
judge
gray.
his
business
was
not
talking
about
judge
gray,
he
wasn't
to
investigate
the
jurors
on
judge
gray,
he
was
to
investigate
the
jurors
on
judge
miller.
but
as
vick
said,
i
got
into
a
conversation
about
the
jurors
in
judge
gray.
now
he
was
working
for
the
government
when
he
said
to
him,
“my
cousin
is
on
the
jury.”
that
was
not
a
job
that
mr.
osborn,
the
petitioner
hired
him.
at
any
rate
the
government
seeks
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
that's
part
of
the
basis
of
the
entrapment.
the
--
my
basis
of
entrapment
goes
further
than
that.
my
basis
on
the
entrapment
goes,
number
one,
that
when
vick
said,
“my
cousin's
on
the
jury.”
he
wasn't
giving
him
a
piece
of
information
for
the
sake
of
giving
him
information.
he
was,
as
he
himself
said,
“i've
said
it
to
him
i
wanted
to
know
what
his
intentions.”
well,
its
not
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
if
the
court
please,
we
say
as
a
matter
of
law.
it's
a
subtle
entrapment
in
contacts
with
the
entire
feature
of
it
here.
vick
on
the
october
the
21st
had
explained
to
sheridan
that
vick
was
on
the
jury
--
his
cousin.
now,
vick
also
said,
and
it's
a
matter
on
the
record
that
vick
said
that
he
had
a
conversation
with
sheridan
and
sheridan
had
said
the
only
way
they
can
win
the
case,
they
must
get
rid
of
osborn.
that
is
also
in
the
record
although
vick
said
it's
true
he
said
it
but
he
said,
“i
lied
when
i
said
it.
the
conversation
didn't
take
place.”
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
his
immediate
response
was,
“go
get
him,
see
him
on
our
side.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
man
--
that
would
--
itself
would
mean
in
plain
english
the
same,
“let's
try
to
bribe
them,
let's
try
to
obstruct
them,
let's
try
to
influence
them.”
no
question
about
that.
but,
what
meaning
did
mr.
vick
have?
it's
the
conduct
of
the
government
that's
in
question
here.
we
can
have
a
situation
where
the
government
sends
around
agents
tempting
people
in
order
that
if
they
succumb
a
case
is
to
be
made,
that's
not
the
business
of
government
agents.
and
the
government's
effort,
as
i
say
--
to
say
that
vick
is
not
a
government
agent
shows
that
they
are
conscious
of
that.
what
right
had
vick
to
say
that?
mr.
jacob
kossman
don't
forget
vick
had
told
to
wallace
in
september,
vick
had
told
another
investigator,
“polk,
i
got
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
vick
had
worked
from
october
the
28th
to
november
the
7th
and
osborn
never
told
him
to
do
something
wrong.
finally,
vick
said,
“i
got
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
who's
doing
the
entrapping?
who
is
the
bad
person?
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
court
instructed
the
jury
entrapment
but
we
say
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
instructions
if
the
court
please
were
that
--
where
the
standard
instructions
of
an
entrapment
if
you
believe
that
he
was
entrapped,
therefore,
you
could
--
you
must
find
them
not
guilty.
in
other
words,
left
the
question
of
entrapment
up
to
the
jury
but
we
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
no
government
agent
has
a
right
to
become
a
tempter,
a
serpent
to
beguile
people,
the
test
is
not
whether
he
should
have
been
strong
enough
to
resist
it.
that
he
should
have
chased
him
away.
that's
not
the
test.
the
test
cannot
be
that.
the
test
has
to
be
in
looking
at
that
particular
individual,
that
he
have
a
right
to
say
to
him,
“my
cousin
is
on
the
jury.”
well,
now
this
is
extremely
important.
the
government
on
its
brief
on
page
47
states
as
follows,
“in
his
dealings
with
petitioner,
up
to
and
including
the
crucial
date
of
november
the
7th,
vick
had
engaged
no
material
deception.”
just
think
of
this.
they
say
vick
had
engaged
no
material
deception.
here
was
vick
way
back
in
february,
reporting
to
the
--
as
of
february
1963,
when
he
was
doing
a
side
work
--
job
for
osborn
reporting
to
the
fbi,
that's
a
matter
of
record.
then
in
june,
then
in
july,
in
august,
yet
they
say
in
his
dealings
with
--
up
to
and
including
the
crucial
date
november
the
7th,
vick
had
engaged
no
material
deception.
i'm
old-fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
if
you
work
for
someone,
you
owe
him
loyalty.
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
telling
the
--
reporting
to
the
government
something
crooked.
don't
forget
up
to
november
the
7th
there
hadn't
been
anything
that
had
been
wrong.
yet,
he
was
reporting
to
the
government;
the
government
said,
“only
report
illegal
activities.”
when
he
talked
on
october
the
21st
to
sheridan,
was
that
an
illegal
activity,
the
fact
that
he
was
--
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury?
now,
the
next
thing
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
--
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
don't
know.
in
other
words,
the
chief
of
police
as
far
as
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
chief
of
the
police
must
have
had
an
interest
in
assisting
the
government
because
he
sought
to
--
that
us
--
that
vick
was
getting
paid
without
working.
so
if
i
--
we
have
to
read
into
record
that
although
it's
not
spelled
out
that
the
chief
of
the
police,
they
don't
allow
a
man
to
collect
$300
or
$400
a
month,
so
he
must
have
known
that
he
was
doing
work
for
the
government.
in
fact,
vick
so
testified
that,
“i
was
on
special
assignment.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
only
if
a
crime
had
been
committed.
mr.
jacob
kossman
only
if
a
crime
to
report
to
the
chief
of
police.
but
there
was
--
on
october
the
21st
there
was
no
crime.
why
did
he
report
to
sheridan
that
vick's
cousin
was
on
the
jury?
the
answer
is
that
this
was
the
basis
and
the
set
up
for
an
entrapment.
there
couldn't
be
any
fix
in
this
case.
the
pro
--
this
--
osborn
didn't
hire
vick
in
order
to
fix
a
juror.
vick
took
the
job
in
order
to
fix
osborn.
that's
--
the
record
spells
that
out.
he
says
so,
vick,
“i
had
never
intended
to
do
anything.
i
only
wanted
to
find
out
his
intentions.”
you
can't
go
and
set
up
people
by
finding
out
their
intentions.
well,
to
come
back
now
was
this
entrapment
business.
it
was
vick
who
was
the
first
one
who
subtly
put
very
subtle
the
idea
of
approaching
elliott
in
the
petitioner's
mind.
not
petitioner
who
originated
the
idea.
it
was
the
same
idea
that
vick
had
on
successfully
looked
to
peddle
to
mr.
wallace
back
in
september
to
another
investigator,
polk
when
he
had
mentioned
to
them
and
they
were
--
said
to
osborn,
“i'm
surprised
they
never
told
it
to
you.”
it's
on
the
same
idea
that
vick
undoubtedly
had
when
they
talked
to
sheridan
on
october
the
21st.
why
he
didn't
call
up
sheridan
and
said
--
and
say,
“i
was
hired”
if
there
wasn't
a
plan?
the
most
telling
features
of
the
plan
are
padlocked
and
to
entrap
the
petitioner
of
these.
first,
he
--
until
confronted
with
the
and
too
confronted
with
the
jencks
act
document,
sheridan's
report,
vick
twice
denied
he
ever
mentioned
elliott
to
anyone.
that
was
the
real
secret
prior
to
mentioning
elliott
to
osborn.
sheridan
said
of
his
understanding
with
vick,
an
understanding
that
was
reached
well
and
advanced
of
his
employment,
“i
want
you
to
represent
me.”
third,
if
the
vick
with
the
hard
locked
story
have
succeeded
in
getting
reemployed
by
petitioner
and
had
advised
sheridan
of
the
fact.
sheridan
said,
“don't
forget,
just
play
it
by
ear
and
continue
discussions
with
osborn
and
report
it
to
me.”
fourth,
vick
admitted,
“i
was
trying
to
find
out
what
mr.
osborn's
intentions
were
and
prove
it
make
a
case.”
fifth,
if
the
petitioner
had
been
disbarred,
vick
boasted
to
wallace
that
his
assignment
was
to
get
tommy.
now,
we
submit
that
of
november
11th
conversation
that
was
recorded
by
wick
--
vick,
which
was
sent
out
at
length
cannot
be
considered
an
isolation.
it's
a
terrible
thing
in
isolation.
it's
a
terrible
thing
taken
in
context
but
in
the
light
of
the
foregoing
facts,
we
say
we
come
under
the
sherman
case
when
petitioner
said
to
vick
the
words
on
which
this
entire
proceeding
was
premised.
they
were
the
product
of
the
creative
activity
of
law
enforcement
officials.
we
haven't
--
that's
why
i
say
we
have
a
case
of
entrapment
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
who
originated
the
idea?
mr.
jacob
kossman
nothing
that
portend
--
the
girl
said,
“hello!
how
are
you?”
this
was
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct!
mr.
jacob
kossman
none
whatsoever.
and,
we
make
none.
we
don't
make
it
an
argument
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
terms
of
vick
himself
to
be
unable
to
testify.
osborn
misplaced,
let's
put
it,
his
confidence
in
a
person.
but
that
doesn't
justify
the
use
of
recorders
or
entrapment.
now,
here
is
a
person,
the
record
is
pitiful,
here
is
a
person
who
have
left
alone
would
have
obeyed
the
law.
just
no
ifs
or
buts
about
it.
the
record
is
completely
silent
on
it.
oh,
yes,
they
bring
up
the
bird
coin.
now,
he
was
acquitted
of
that.
now,
the
government
has
seen
fit
to
print
the
direct
examination
of
beard
when
he
was
acquitted
and
they
say
it
still
has
some
value
although
he
was
acquitted.
we
say
if
he
was
acquitted,
you
cannot
use
that
as
any
evidence
of
the
predisposition
whatsoever.
now
i
made
this
mistake,
a
serious
mistake,
but
unfortunately
i
believe
i
can
correct
it.
on
the
notes
of
testimony
of
page
134
of
beard's
cross
examination
which
is
not
in
the
record
--
the
court,
by
134
beard
had
testified,
well,
that
he
would
--
that
osborn
wanted
to
give
him
ten
thousand.
he
turned
it
down
and
then
he
turned
it
down
in
a
nice
way
by
saying,
“i
want
fifty
thousand.
and
he
said
he
never
reported
this
because
“i
was
afraid
i
might
be
killed,
my
family
might
be
hurt”
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
that's
what
he
said.
acquitted.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
beard
was
an
individual
that
osborn
was
charged
with
having
contact
with
the
goal
try
to
see
the
husband
of
a
juror
in
the
second
count,
but
he
was
acquitted
of
that.
now
the
government,
however,
wants
to
make
mileage
on
the
fact
even
though
he
was
acquitted,
they
wanted
to
show
this
is
a
predisposition
in
terms
of
--
to
do
bad
things
on
the
part
of
osborn.
so
they
printed
the
direct
examination
and
i
didn't
have
enough
sense
to
print
the
cross-examination
because
i
just
didn't.
but
at
any
rate,
in
the
cross-examination
of
beard,
here
is
beard
testifying
that
they
gave
us
reason.
maybe
it
was
true,
maybe
it
was
false
according
to
the
jury
but
at
any
rate,
here
is
beard
back
again
in
1963
in
134,
135
working
for
osborn
again
and
he
receives
$60
on
june
the
12th
1963
and
in
june
the
18th,
1963.
so
there
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
the
notes
of
testimony
which
i
didn't
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
you
all
--
the
certified
copy
of
the
notes
of
testimony
would
come
up.
mr.
jacob
kossman
those
are
the
pages
of
the
original
record
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
which
i
--
the
government
printed
in
the
end
in
the
b
forum.
in
fact,
they
even
printed
things
they
didn't
have
to.
they
printed
the
grand
jury
notes.
well,
at
any
rate,
so
much
for
the
beard
thing
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
point
is
this,
the
government
is
looking
to
make
mileage
even
though
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
he
had
a
predisposition
in
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well
yes,
yes.
in
other
words,
beard
had
said
on
the
stand
that
the
reason
he
didn't
report
the
so-called
approach
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
in
1962,
was
before
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
actually,
it
wasn't
this
indictment
of
which
osborn
was
acquitted,
was
a
three-count
indictment.
but
the
reason
he
gave
why
he
didn't
report
this
unlawful
act
that
he
had
said
osborn
committed
was
because
he
was
afraid
he
might
be
killed.
you
know
the
--
working
for
bad
people
and
so
on
and
so
forth
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
now
we
find
them
back
in
june
of
1963
doing
an
investigation
for
osborn
on
a
--
of
course,
this
so-called,
“do
indictment
of
(inaudible)
made
in
1963.”
that
he
made
--
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
take
the
time
up
to
explain
it
but
it's
because
the
government
put
it
in
and
the
--
and
half
the
trial
was
devoted
to
the
beard
case.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
the
government
spent
half
the
time
arguing
to
that
--
here
you
had
predisposition
and
the
judge
charged
that
you
find
that
he
was
involved
with
this
beard
thing
you
can
say
that's
a
sign,
he
was
a
bad
person
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
they
get
the
windfall
of
a
man
--
of
a
person
who
was
acquitted.
so,
therefore,
we
say
at
the
least
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
shorn
of
that
prejudicial
business
of
predisposition.
when
osborn
flatly
said,
“this
man
was
a
liar
at
the
trial.”
there'd
be
a
conviction,
i
certainly
couldn't
argue
that.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i'll
put
it
to
you,
your
honor,
i'm
only
using
it
to
answer
the
argument
that
beard
said
that
he
was
afraid
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
of
all,
he
employed
him.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
surely.
mr.
jacob
kossman
just
as
he
testified.
mr.
jacob
kossman
just
as
beard
testified.
mr.
jacob
kossman
of
course,
needless
to
say
beard
was
not
indicted
in
the
transaction.
well,
now,
i'm
coming
to
the
last
point
and
it's
this,
to
be
discussed
orally.
it's
this,
basically
it's
our
position
that
the
judges
were
not
rebuttal
witnesses
but
they
gave
opinion
testimony.
it
was
terrible.
here
are
two
federal
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
here
is
a
jury
drawn
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee,
with
all
that
we've
been
told
that
the
slightest
words
of
a
judge
how
important
it
is
that
how
the
--
and
rightly
so,
how
important
it
is
in
terms
of
affecting
the
decision
of
--
by
a
jury.
here
are
two
judges,
one
stepping
down
from
the
bench,
from
his
own
courtroom
to
sit
in
the
witness
chair
and
the
other
saying,
“i'm
now
sitting
my
courtroom”
and
they
said
in
plain
words
“osborn
was
guilty.”
they
said,
“we
wanted
to
make
this
investigation
to
find
out
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not.”
now,
it's
no
use
saying
its
rebuttal
testimony.
the
argument
wasn't
--
it's
not
rebuttal
of
anything.
the
disbarment
proceedings
and
all
that
had
been
put
in
into
the
case
during
their
case
at
chief.
why
do
they
call
the
two
federal
judges
to
testify?
in
their
brief
they
say,
“well,
you
know
that
might
have
been
hearsay
to
putting
them
in.”
maybe
it
was
but
there
was
no
objection
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
might
have
been
objections
on
other
reasons
but
there
was
no
objection.
now
worse
than
that,
they
now
take
the
affidavit
that
vick
had
written.
here's
an
affidavit,
they
think
there's
special
merit
to
that
thing
that
it's
sworn.
here's
an
affidavit
that
vick
had
sworn
to
and
they
put
that
in
evidence.
in
fact,
the
--
the
judge
interrupts
the
speech
to
the
jury
and
passes
it
by,
and
passes
it
to
the
jury
so
that
they
can
read
it.
now
why?
why
should
that
affidavit,
it's
self-supporting?
after
all
vick
had
testified.
true,
osborn
had
contradicted
vick
but
vick
didn't
take
the
stand
on
rebuttal
but
this-
its
a
different
thing.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
first
of
all,
if
they
want
to
go
to
get
a
search
warrant,
they'd
have
to
get
notice
to
mr.
osborn.
that's
one
of
the
features
involved
with
electronic
recording
machines
whether
a
search
warrant
--
they
defend
on
the
ground
that
they
were
a
little
bit
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
lo
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
when
you
come
with
the
search
warrant.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
when
you
get
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
you
bring
--
execute
is
the
correct
word,
you
bring
it
to
the
person
whose
premises
you
want
to
search,
you
have
to
tell
him.
and
that's
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
now
being
debated.
what
can
we
do
about
it?
i
say
that
our
way
of
life
comes
first
and
search
warrants
come
second.
at
any
rate,
the
government
tries
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
this
was
kind
of
a
search
warrant
because
they
went
to
tell
the
judge
about
it.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
order
what
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
just
go
do
it,
just
go
do
it,
their
own
words.
mr.
jacob
kossman
before
he
came
in
with
this
little
midget.
now,
here's
something
else,
you
see
this
is
a
--
what
bothers
me
is
this,
it's
just
a
scheme.
they
didn't
need
the
judges.
under
the
law
of
that
kind,
all
that
sheridan,
all
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
do
was
to
say
and
still
is
the
law
as
of
this
moment.
here,
here's
the
recording
machine.
in
the
lopez
case,
they
didn't
run
to
a
federal
judge.
in
the
on
lee
case,
they
run
--
didn't
run
to
a
federal
judge.
they
had
no
right
going
to
the
federal
judge
and
the
federal
judges
had
no
right
yielding
and
--
to
the
district
attorney's
ex
parte
conversations.
and
that's
something
that
this
court
in
the
supervisory
capacity
should
give
an
order
that
prosecutors
should
not
run
around
to
federal
district
judges
and
have
conversations
and
do
things
not
only
limited
to
this
expression.
now,
why
is
this
a
terrible
thing?
here
is
vick's
bad
reputation
as
a
liar.
even
the
judge
himself
at
the
trial
just
--
as
i
don't
know,
i
can't
make
out
a
tale
out
of
it
so
to
speak.
now,
here
are
federal
judges
who
were
given
opinion
testimony.
because
--
why
do
i
say
opinion
testimony?
they
said
we
wanted
to
investigate
whether
that
he
was
guilty
or
not.
we
disbarred
him.
well,
people
aren't
disbarred
for
good
conduct.
i
mean,
they
knew
he
--
they
would
disbar
because
these
judges
felt
he
was
guilty.
that's
why
the
district
attorney's
put
these
two
judges
on
the
stand.
i
don't
say
these
judges
willingly
went
on
the
stand
but
they
went
on
the
stand.
and
the
prosecutor
had
no
right
in
a
live
case
to
use,
misuse
federal
judges
for
their
purpose.
mr.
jacob
kossman
(inaudible)
instructions
just
when
they
started
to
the
speeches,
so
the
judges
reversed
themselves.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
on
page
6.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
was
an
exhibit.
just
before
mr.
buker
(ph)
started
to
talk
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
here
it
is,
page
664.
court
reopens
government's
case.
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
neil,
i'm
about
to
overlook
something,
it's
been
called
to
the
court's
attention
just
before
the
noon
adjournment.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
as
i
say
it
was
put
in
evidence
on
page
653a.
what
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
at
first
had
been
turned
down.
then,
had
been
put
an
evidence
and
in
order
to
boost
the
rock,
his
oral
statement,
even
though
there
was
no
contradiction
between
it
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
objected.
now
the
government
makes
an
argument
they
say,
“well,
we
asked
for
a
limiting
instruction.
why
don't
you
ask
preliminary
instructions?”
we
don't
--
we
came
this
for
a
limiting
instruction.
we
waived
our
right.
we
said
that's
not
rebuttal,
you
have
no
right
to
put
it
in.
the
same
is
with
the
judges.
they'd
--
their
testimony
was
not
rebuttal
of
a
thing,
just
not
rebuttal
of
a
thing.
what
did
they
testify?
they
want
to
know
whether
he
is
guilty
or
not
and
that's
why
they
prove
the
charges.
now,
the
government
comes
up
with
another
noble
argument
in
order
to
justify
judicial
intervention,
a
criminal
trial.
they
say,
well,
it's
a
question
of
credibility
and
the
judges
had
a
right
to
testify
in
order
to
show
that
it
was
credible.
what
took
place
between
osborn
and
vick?
what
did
these
judges
know
what
took
place
between
osborn
and
vick?
they
weren't
present.
they
never
even
talked
to
vick.
how
could
they
testify
to
anything
except
affidavit?
what
they
have
said
in
the
disbarment
proceedings
was
already
a
part
of
the
case
in
the
direct
thing.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
actually,
it
already
had
been
in
evidence,
if
your
honor
please,
so
therefore
an
objection
to
open
the
case
in
order
that
some
members
of
the
jury,
i
guess
hadn't
seen
this
paper,
would
not
have
been
particularly
valid.
there
had
been
an
objection
to
admitting
the
affidavit
in
evidence.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i'm
only
talking
about
the
prejudicial
effect,
how
it
was
compounded
by
the
original
admission
of
this
affidavit.
in
other
words,
the
objection
was
--
here
is
page
653a,
“do
you
have
any
objection?”
mr.
norman
took
an
exception
and
they
read
the
exhibit
17.
so,
therefore,
he
had
objected
to
it.
now,
mr.
buker

said,
“we
would
like
to
pass
this,
if
your
honor
please,
this
document
of
the
jury.”
and
it
says
here
in
parenthesis,
exhibit
passed
to
the
jury
for
examination.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
mean,
which
page
are
you
reading
from,
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
kossman
655a?
mr.
jacob
kossman
corrected.
if
the
court
please,
mr.
buker
(ph)
we
would
like
to
pass
this,
if
your
honor,
please.
now
on
653a,
mr.
norman
was
objecting
to
this.
mr.
norman
is
objecting
to
this
on
page
653a.
now,
mr.
norman
then
says
--
this
is
conversations
here
with
a
judge
--
entrapment,
i
mean,
the
exhibit
already
had
gone
in.
653a.
mr.
jacob
kossman
do
i
make
myself
clear
then?
mr.
jacob
kossman
on
what
page?
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
664
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh,
well,
off
course,
don't
you
--
you're
correct
your
honor
but
at
that
time
already
it
had
been
admitted
into
evidence
on
page
60
--
53a
over
the
objection
as
to
this
business
of
allowing
the
two
jurors
to
see
it,
who
had
missed
seeing
it.
mr.
norman
did
not
object
to
that.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
mean,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
make
it
clear
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
in
that
sense.
well,
we
simply
say
this
wasn't
rebuttal.
it
can't
be
justified
even
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
in
fact
we
say
this,
even
if
this
was
rebuttal
in
the
case
of
the
government's
side,
it
is
in
our
side,
not
the
--
even
if
it
was
rebuttal,
it
would
be
objectionable
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
have
allowed
that
testimony
by
two
federal
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
who
had
disbarred
the
petitioner
to
testify,
that
they
authorized
these
proceedings
to
know
whether
he
is
guilty
or
not.
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
i
have
two
minutes?
mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
justice
clark,
on
page
653-a,
vick
states,
“on
october
28,
1963,
osborn
asked
me
if
would
have
take
employment.
i
telephonically
communicated
this
fact
to
walter
b.
sheridan.”
that's
to
be
found
on
page
653-a.
certainly,
not
on
the
legal
activity
that
he
was
reporting
to
sheridan.
now,
but
more
important
on
page
383-a,
there
was
evidence
in
the
government's
case
in
chief
of
the
authorization.
judge,
they
read
government
exhibit
13,
14
and
15.
on
friday,
november
the
8th
1963,
judge
miller
and
i
individually
were
presented
with
an
affidavit.
this
is
being
read
to
the
jury,
with
mr.
neil
taking
the
part
of
judge
miller
and
mr.
hooker
taking
the
part
of
judge
gray
and
they
begun
reading
the
transcript
and
according
to
the
affidavit,
we
individually
and
i
supposed
concurrently
authorized
further
investigations
of
the
matter.
so,
as
far
as
the
jury
was
concerned,
as
far
as
the
case
was
concerned,
the
jury
knew
that
these
two
judges
have
authorized.
so,
therefore,
when
we
say
there
isn't
rebuttal
of
that
thing,
there
isn't
rebuttal
of
that
thing.
now,
this
business
of
discussing
to
juror
elliot
with
anybody
before
you
took
to
osborn,
the
record
was
clear
that
vick
tried
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
had
discussed
it,
perfectly
here
on
page
138.
question:
“had
you
discussed
that
juror
eliot
with
anybody
before
you
talk
to
mr.
osborn
about
it?”
“no,
sir.”
“no
living
human
being?”
and
the
two
prosecutors
were
sitting
there
when
he
was
making
those
statements
and
they
did
not
object
to
say
anything
about
it
even
though
they
knew
it
wasn't
so.
and
finally,
even
though
in
the
re-direct
examination,
if
the
trial
he
says
this
question,
“have
you
discussed
with
anybody
connected
with
the
government",
vick
has
asked
this
question,
the
matter
of
going
to
see
elliot,
of
elliot
being
kin
to
you
or
you
being
close
to
him,
anything
of
that
sort?”
and
then
comes
up
the
junk
statement
on
october
the
21st
which
shows
it.
thank
you.
