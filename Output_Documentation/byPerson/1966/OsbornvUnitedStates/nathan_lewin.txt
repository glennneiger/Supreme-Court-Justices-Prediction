mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
conviction
of
petitioner,
a
member
of
the
tennessee
bar
since
1940
on
count
1
of
an
indictment
alleging
violations
of
the
general
obstruction
of
justice
statute,
18
u.s.c.
1503.
in
the
count
on
which
he
was
convicted,
petitioner
was
charged
with
having
requested
and
directed
one
robert
vick,
a
nashville
police
officer,
who
he
had
retained
to
investigate
prospective
jurors
to
offer
a
$10,000
bribe
to
a
cousin
of
vick's,
who
was
a
potential
juror
in
a
trial
on
which
petitioner
was
scheduled
to
represent
one
of
then
five
defendants.
the
charges
on
which
the
defendants
were
being
tried
involved
four
other
endeavors,
corruptly
who
approached
jurors
in
an
earlier
criminal
trial.
and
those
charges
resulted
in
the
convictions
of
five
defendants.
four
of
whom
are
before
the
court
in
the
case
immediately
--
to
be
argued
immediately
following
this
one
and
on
the
fifth
of
which,
the
case
on
the
fifth
that
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
last
term
and
denied
with
a
petition
for
rehearing
just
this
past
monday.
the
government's
evidence
at
petitioner's
trial
consisted
essentially
of
the
testimony
of
vick,
the
police
officer;
corroboration
of
that
testimony
in
the
form
of
a
tape
recording
of
the
last
of
three
conversations
between
petitioner
and
vick
on
that
subject
and
third,
petitioner's
admissions,
partly
false
exculpatory
statements
which
he
made
in
the
course
of
the
disbarment
proceedings
which
were
conducted
in
the
federal
district
court
in
nashville
very
shortly
after
the
events
at
issue
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
in
a
federal
district
court,
yes.
proceedings
in
the
state,
to
disbar
him
in
the
--
from
practice
in
the
state
court
have
--
are
still
pending.
and,
i
imagine,
really
being
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
argument
in
this
case.
petitioner's
sole
defense
at
his
trial
was
entrapment
based
largely
on
the
claim
that
the
entire
course
of
conduct
was
part
of
a
government
plot
intended
to
disqualify
him
from
representing
james
hoffa
in
the
forthcoming
trial
on
obstruction
of
justice
charges.
that
issue
of
entrapment
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
to
which
petitioner
did
not
object
at
his
trial
and
to
which
he
has
interposed
only
the
most
technical
and
minor
challenges
which
we
rebut
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
since
the
entrapment
question
was
the
major
focus
of
trial
and
since
petitioner's
other
major
contentions
are
related
in
some
way
to
the
cases
that
immediately
followed
this
one,
it
will
be
more
exhaustively
discussed
in
certain
ways.
in
those
cases,
i
would
like
with
the
court's
permission
to
direct
my
argument,
first
to
the
entrapment
issue
and
then
in
turn
to
the
fourth
amendment
claims
relating
to
the
recording
and
insofar
as
the
issues
in
succeeding
cases
here
involved
to
those
issues
as
well.
and
i
would
leave
for
conclusion
for
such
time
which
has
left
petitioner's
final
contention
which
is
not
at
all
discussed
in
mr.
kossman's
oral
argument
that
there
was
no
obstruction
of
--
no
violation
of
the
statute
here
because
the
attempt
was
“factually
impossible.”
the
principle
contention
relative
to
entrapment
is
that
the
evidence
established
that
defense
so
conclusively
that
the
issue
should
not
even
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
now
there
are,
of
course,
instances
in
which
this
court
has
held,
particularly
in
sherman
versus
united
states
in
356
u.s.
that
that
course
is
appropriate.
this
case,
both
on
the
testimony
of
vick
and
we
submit
even
on
the
testimony
of
petitioner
as
to
what
happened
between
vick
and
himself
is
not
one
of
those
cases.
the
facts
are
not
really
complex
but
before
even
turning
to
those,
i
think
it's
important
to
dispose
of
a
basic
misapprehension
which
runs
through
petitioner's
brief
and
through
the
oral
argument.
one
of
the
much
debated
issues
at
trial
or
at
least
debated
to
some
extent
was
whether
vick
was
an
agent
of
the
government
in
november
whether
he
was
an
undercover
informant
as
of
that
time.
and
petitioner's
counsel
attempted
on
various
occasions
to
get
vick
to
admit
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
federal
government
when
he
was
speaking
with
petitioner
or
indeed
when
he
accepted
employment
from
petitioner
in
october
of
1963.
now,
the
extent
of
vick's
agency
in
that
respect,
whether
he
had
been
deputized
by
the
federal
government
was
certainly
an
element
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
in
determining
whether
there
was
any
substance
to
petitioner's
claim
that
this
was
part
of
large
plot
by
the
government
to
entrapment
into
making
statements.
but
we
submit
that
on
--
the
issue
now
before
the
court
as
to
whether
there
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
question
is
really
not
seriously
involved
because
even
if
the
jury
had
concluded
on
the
testimony
that
vick
had
been
deputized
by
the
federal
government
or
had
been
told
to
speak
to
osborn,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
defense
of
entrapment
would
not
be
made
out
because
the
conversations
between
petitioner
and
vick
were
such
that
--
under
vick's
version,
they
couldn't
know
if
it
amount
to
entrapment
and
under
petitioners
they
would
at
most
amount
even
if
made
directly
to
a
paid
agent
of
the
government
who
isn't
in
the
employ
of
the
federal
government.
they
would
at
most
amount
to
an
issue
that
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
they
were
a
standard
form
of
instructions,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
that
the
jury
was
told
that
if
--
and
an
instruction
in
toto,
i
might
say,
appears
in
two
paragraphs
on
page
697
of
the
record.
and
in
short,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
idea
of
committing
the
crime
that
--
instructed
jury
that
unlawful
entrapment
amounted
to
a
course
of
conduct
on
which
the
government
originated
the
idea
of
committing
the
crime
and
without
any
prior
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
commit
it,
he
had
been
urged
and
induced
by
the
government
so
to
commit
it.
and
if
the
jury
so
found
it
was
instructed
to
--
find
the
defendant
not
guilty.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
of
course
the
defendant
didn't
object
to
that
particular
use
of
the
words.
i
think
really
what
he
meant
was
government
conduct
which
amounts
to
what
this
court
has
called
“providing
an
opportunity
for
the
commission
of
crime”
and
in
the
court
--
this
court
in
sherman
spoke
of
drawing
the
line
between
a
trap
for
the
unwary
criminal
and
a
trap
for
the
unwary
innocent.
and
i
think
that's
really
what
the
court
meant
that
lawful
entrapment
would
amount
to
a
trap
for
the
unwary
criminal.
unlawful
entrapment
of
course
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary
innocent,
a
man
who
would
not
otherwise
have
a
disposition
to
commit
the
offense,
commits
it
only
because
the
government
has
urged
and
induced
them
to
do
so.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
never
heard
of
it
before
either
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
think
from
the
whole
context
of
the
instruction
its
quite
clear
that
the
court
was
really
intending
to
warn
the
jury
that
it
need
not
acquit
the
defendant
merely
because
he
fell
into
a
government
trap.
the
government
may
use
a
trap.
and
that's
--
and
possibly
the
use
of
the
word
“entrapment”
might
otherwise
under
the
standard
instruction
in
some
way
confuse
the
jury
into
the
believing
that
if
there
was
any
trap
laid
then
the
defendant
must
be
acquitted.
on
--
just
on
the
question
of
vick's
agency
vis-à-vis,
the
federal
government,
and
to
clear
up
some
matters
that
were
raised
during
petitioners
argument,
i
think
i
should
make
clear
that
there
were
some
discussions
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
vick
was
drawing
his
salary.
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
incidence
in
question
in
this
case,
at
the
time
that
he
was
speaking
to
petitioner,
and
been
hired
by
petitioner
to
do
investigative
work,
he
was
in
no
way
drawing
any
salary
from
the
federal
government
nor
has
he
ever
drawn
any
salary
from
the
federal
government.
the
testimony
which
mr.
kossman
referred
was
testimony
relating
to
what
vick
was
doing
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
trial.
now
as
of
that
time,
in
preparation
for
that
trial
and
presumably
because
he
was
then
being
called
on
to
be
interviewed,
and
maybe
appear
before
grand
jury,
he
was
excused
from
a
state
or
city
service
and
was
on
assignment
in
that
section
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
far
as
i
know,
at
the
time
of
the
incidence,
he
was.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
to
rebut
the
fact
that
he
was.
he
did
testify
that
he
was
a
police
officer.
he
had
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
mr.
nathan
lewin
moonlighting,
doing
investigative
work
on
the
side.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
he
was
doing
it
all
the
time
i
gather
during
that
earlier
trial
and
for
--
or
at
least
the
first
part
of
the
earlier
trial
in
the
fall
of
1962.
again
in
around
january
or
february
of
1963,
again
for
that
short
period
of
time
that
petitioner
retained
him
in
the
summer
of
1963
and
then
again
in
october
of
1963.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they're
all
--
very
all
--
a
very
definite
short
periods,
several
weeks,
several
--
maybe
a
month
or
month
and
a
half.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
doesn't
appear
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
i
understand
he
was
paid
by
the
day.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
imagine
must
be
an
eight
hour
day,
maybe
he
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
record
doesn't
show.
i
don't
think
exactly
how
it
was.
(inaudible)
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know.
apparently,
it
was
not
a
matter
that
he
had
gone
into
any
detail
at
the
trial
so
i
suspect
that
is
--
it's
not
considered
that
unusual
maybe
in
nashville.
but
i
know
that
it
is
a
rather
surprising
fact.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
records
don't
show
that,
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
do
show
definitely
though
that
osborn
knew
as
of
the
fall
of
1963
that
he
had
even
spoken
to
sheridan
--
petitioner
himself
testified
that
he
had
spoken
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
record
shows
that
he
was
recommended
by
one
ramsey,
who
was
also
an
investigator
for
vick.
it
may
--
i'm
really
not
sure.
i
think
it
does
show
that
he
was.
that
he
did
know
that
he
is
a
police
officer.
i
don't
think
it
was
a
secret.
i
don't
think
anybody
who
was
there
in
the
investigation
of
--the
whole
team
of
investigators
was
not
acquainted
with
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes,
you
are
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
about
the
fall
of
'62,
right.
i
think
certainly
--
definitely
by
the
time
of
the
events
here,
osborn
must
have
known,
that's
right
from
that
state.
the
principal
question
on
entrapment
under
this
court's
and
lower
courts
decision
of
course
is,
in
--
this
is
the
question
that
arise
as
nearly
all
the
entrapment
cases
is
what
the
conduct
of
the
entrapper
is
vis-à-vis,
the
one
who
claims
to
be
entrapped.
in
other
words,
the
dozens
or
scores
of
entrapment
cases
all
involve
government
employees
who
engaged
in
undercover
capacity,
who
speak
to
a
defendant
and
the
question
is
whether
they
induced
the
defendant
to
commit
the
crime
or
whether
the
defendant
himself
was
disposed
so
to
do
and
all
that
the
entrapper
did
was
provide
him
with
the
opportunity
to
perform
and
commit
that
particular
crime.
and
that
we
submit
is
what
the
central
issue
is
before
this
court
at
this
juncture
whether
in
his
conduct
with
petitioner,
vick
induced
somebody
who
was
willing
to
perform
the
crime
and
looking
for
an
approach
to
a
juror
to
perform
it
or
whether
he
under
the
--
oh,
under
the
evidence
that
were
submitted
to
the
jury
or
under
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
inducing
the
commission
of
a
crime.
we
think
that
vick's
testimony
makes
it
entirely
clear
and
vick's
testimony
certainly
could
be
believed
by
the
jury
and
under
this
court
decision
in
the
masciale
case
in
356
u.s.,
the
jury
was
free
to
believe
vick's
testimony
and
vick's
testimony
was
that
it
required
nothing
more
to
get
petitioner
to
suggest
to
him
an
approach
to
a
juror
than
the
mere
statement
on
november
the
7th
of
1963,
“i
have
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
and
that
statement
was
true.
and
it
caused
petitioner
to
go
out
into
the
alley
with
him
or
out
on
the
alley
near
his
office
with
him
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
approach
that
juror.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
concluding
my
argument
on
the
entrapment
issue,
i
would
only
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
several
particular
circumstances
arising
out
of
the
record
in
this
case
which
strongly
support
the
jury's
conclusion
of
no
entrapment
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
including
petitioner's
own
testimony.
and
they
are
first
that
in
passing
on
the
entrapment
claim,
the
jury
was
certainly
entitled
to
consider
who
it
is,
who
was
alleged
to
have
been
entrapping
whom,
a
policeman
of
less
than
one
year's
experience
allegedly
entrapping
in
three
or
five
or
six
meetings
according
to
petitioner,
an
attorney
of
more
than
20
years
standing.
and
this
is
a
defense
which
the
jury
was
certainly
entitled
to
view
with
skepticism
in
light
of
the
kind
of
case
that
was
involved
or
in
light
of
the
charges
as
to
which
the
petitioner
was
defending
in
the
forthcoming
trial
which
for
themselves
obstruction
of
justice
charges
or
attempts
to
bribe
jurors.
it's
hard
to
be
likely
that
an
attorney
in
those
circumstances
would
be
readily
and
even
half
a
dozen
meetings
entrapped
into
making
this
kind
of
an
offer.
in
addition,
it
appears
quite
clear
from
petitioner's
own
testimony
that
he
was
the
one
who
was
instructing,
on
the
very
fine
details
of
jury
bribery.
according
to
his
own
testimony,
by
the
third
or
fourth
meeting
he
was
advising
vick
that
the
way
to
bribe
a
juror
was
to
pay
half
down
and
half
later
or
that
the
best
way
to
find
out
whether
prospective
juror
would
take
to
be
bribed
would
be
to
ask
him
he
wanted
and
then
double
the
amount.
and
that
appears
from
petitioner's
own
testimony.
and
then
the
final
and
conclusive
bit
of
evidence
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
very
persuasive
which
i
think
the
jury
certainly
was
entitled
to
find
almost
conclusive
was
the
reading
of
the
transcript
of
november
11
that
which
appears
at
pages
5
through
8
of
our
brief.
the
--
merely
reading
of
that
transcript,
we
believe,
discloses
makes
it
entirely
clear
in
the
dealings
between
petitioner
and
vick,
exactly
who
it
is,
who
was
the
svengali
and
who
it
is
who
was
trilby.
it's
quite
clear
from
that
conversation
that
vick
was
reporting
to
his
master
and
asking
his
advice
as
to
what
steps
to
take
next.
in
light
of
all
that
evidence,
of
course,
we
are
not
contending
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
but
in
light
of
all
that
proof,
our
burden
is
certainly
satisfied
sufficiently
to
warrant
the
submission
of
the
issue
of
entrapment
to
the
jury
under
proper
instructions
and
that's
what
we've
done
in
this
case.
let
me
now
turn
to
the
petitioner's
subsidiary
challenge
on
the
entrapment
issue
which
is
the
rebuttal
testimony
introduced
in
answer
to
the
entrapment
claim
was
improper.
petitioner
focuses
on
the
two
bits
of
rebuttal
testimony
which
are
the
affidavit
of
vick
in
which
he
related
according
to
his
story
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
petitioner
on
november
7
which
was,
according
to
vick,
the
very
first
time
that
he
ever
mentioned
to
petitioner
that
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury
and
the
judges
testimony
that
they
had
authorized
that
recording.
now
i
think
it's
important,
just
preliminarily,
that
to
make
clear
that
the
judges
in
no
way
testified
that
they
believed
that
petitioner
was
guilty
of
attempting
to
bribe
the
juror.
their
testimony
was
very
severely
limited.
the
government
did
not
attempt
to
introduce
any
opinion,
evidence
of
their
part
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
in
any
way.
they
testified
merely
as
to
what
was
done
on
november
8:
that
the
government
prosecutors
came
to
them,
advice
them
that
they
had
an
affidavit
from
a
man
who
said
that
petitioner
was
attempting
to
bribe
the
juror
and
that
the
government
didn't
know
what
do
to
in
those
circumstances
and
that
the
prosecutors
themselves
could
not,
in
light
of
the
petitioner's
good
reputation,
in
light
of
petitioners
standing
in
the
national
bar
did
not
know
whether
to
credit
the
story.
when
the
judges
testified
that
having
read
the
affidavit,
they
authorized
the
prosecutors
to
send
vick
back
in
with
a
tape
recording.
now,
the
judges'
testimony
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
reason,
mr.
justice
harlan
was
really
because
the
prosecutors
realized
that
this
was
a
matter
going
into
the
integrity
of
justice
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
if
the
government
had
been
seeking
merely
the
equivalent
of
a
search
warrant,
and
that
was
also
part
of
our
purpose
in
court,
but
if
they'd
been
seeking
merely
the
equivalent
of
the
search
warrant,
then
of
course,
it
would
have
been
adequate
to
go
to
one
judge
or
to
a
commissioner.
but
since
this
was
a
matter
which
went
-
-
both
because
it
involve
an
officer
of
the
court
and
because
it
involve
charges
of
jury
entrapping,
it
went
to
the
integrity
of
justice,
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
that
court,
the
government
felt
it
was
appropriate
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
-
-
and
affect
the
whole
court
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
which
was
both
federal
district
judges.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they
both
had.
well,
the
jury
panel
would
have
been
judge,
as
an
initial
matter,
the
case
was
assigned
to
judge
gray
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
because
judge
miller
had
refused
himself.
but
there
was
a
possibility
that
if
judge
gray's
panel
had
been
exhausted,
that
the
jury
panel
in
judge
miller's
courtroom
would
be
called
upon
to
serve
on
judge
gray.
so
that
they
work
to
that
extent,
both
interested
because
they
both
had
jury
panel
which
might
serve
on
that
trial.
but
i
think
the
main
reason
why
it's
just
that
the
government
felt
that
this
was
something
which
the
entire
court
of
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
should
have
before
it,
before
the
government
took
further
steps
to
determine
whether
the
allegations
were
true
or
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
judges'
testimony?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
defendant's
evidence
and
the
defendant
had
presented
evidence
in
which
he
attempted,
the
petitioner
attempted
to
show
that
this
was
all
vick's
discussions
with
him
were
all
part
of
entrapment
scheme
and
plot
on
the
government
to
get
him,
to
ensnare
him
into
making
this
statement.
the
government
then
in
rebuttal,
at
the
conclusion
on
defendant's
evidence
put
on
judge,
first
judge
gray
to
testify
and
then
judge
miller
to
testify
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
obtaining
of
the
recording.
we
feel
that
this
was
perfectly
proper
rebuttal
evidence
really
for
three
reasons,
because
it
went
to
three
issues
which
we
think
were
raised
by
petitioner's
own
testimony,
by
petitioner's
own
defense
which
we
could
not,
which
the
government
could
not
have
anticipated
as
part
of
his
direct
case
but
which
is,
which
was
perfectly
proper
to
rebut
as
part
of,
of
course
in
government's
rebuttal.
and
those
three
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
tape
recording,
as
part
of
the
government's
original
case,
vick
testified
and
he
just
merely
testified
that
he
had
a
discussion
with
petitioner
on
november
7;
that
thereafter,
he
was
equipped
with
the
tape
recorder
and
had
another
discussion
with
petitioner
on
november
8
when
apparently
the
tape
recorder
did
not
work.
and
that
he
was
again
equipped
with
the
tape
recorder
on
november
11
and
the
tape
recording
then
did
work.
he
then
identified
the
tape
and
the
fbi
agents
identified
the
tape
and
the
tape
recording
was
put
into
evidence
as
part
of
the
government's
original
case
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
vick
as
to
his
discussions
with
the
petitioner.
now,
petitioner
in
his
case,
in
his
defense
testified
that
this
whole
course
of
conduct,
vick's
discussions
with
him
were
part
of
a
government
plot
intended
to
ensnare
him
into
making
statements
and
into
offering
a
bribe
to
a
juror.
and,
it
was
petitioner's
version
that
vick
first
began
mentioning
his
relationship
to
the
juror
on
october
28
when
he
was
retained
by
petitioner
and
that
vick
then
returned
on
the
following
day.
and
again,
three
or
four
days
later
and
suggested
that
each
time
that
he
would
first,
the
first
time
that
he
would
speak
with
his
cousin
and
on
the
third
visit
that
he
had
spoken
with
his
cousin
and
that
his
cousin
is
willing
to
accept
the
bribe.
now,
of
course,
petitioner's
own
testimony
admitted
that
he
met
the
suggestion
only
--
responded
to
the
suggestion
only
weakly
and
didn't
really
offer
any
resistance
that
by
the
third
meeting
he
was
instructing
vick
on
exactly
how
to
go
about
bribing
the
juror.
but
nonetheless,
there
was
presented
to
the
jury
as
a
conclusion
of
the
defendant's
case,
a
clear
dispute
in
the
testimony
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
vick
between
october
28
and
november
7,
which
was
date
when
vick
claim
that
he
first
had
a
discussion
with
petitioner
about
his
cousin
being
on
the
jury.
now,
the
judges'
rebuttal
testimony
and
the
affidavit
of
vick,
we
think,
went
to
three
factual
issues
that
was
then
properly
before
the
jury.
one
was
the
question
of
whether
the
recording
itself
which
petitioner's
counsel
attacked
--
we
refer
to
the
various
times
in
petitioner's
own
examination
is
that
thing
on
vick's
bag
and
implying
to
the
jury
that
this
was
part
of
a
devious
course
of
conduct
by
the
government
to
have
worked,
the
petitioner
up
to
his
stay
where
he
would
be
making
a
statement
into
recording
device
that
that
recording
was
unauthorized,
unlawful
part
of
an
unlawful
scheme
by
the
government.
we
think
that
it
was
appropriate
to
put
on
the
judges
to
testify
that
the
government
had
come
to
them.
government
prosecutors
had
come
to
the
judges
in
their
dilemma
to
seek
authorization
for
that,
that
kind
of
investigative
step;
that
the
jury
would,
otherwise,
have
had
the
reason
to
believe
that
the
government
was
acting
improperly.
now
it's
true
that
in
passing,
in
reading
petitioner's
own
admissions
to
the
judges
in
the
disbarment
proceeding,
what
was
also
read
to
the
jury
was
the
fact
that
judge
gray
had
then
said
in
the
course
of
the
disbarment
proceeding,
that
he
had
authorized
the
recording.
but
that
did
not
put
before
the
jury
in
any
way
other
than
hearsay
the
fact
that
the
judges
had
authorized
him.
those
transcripts
were
introduced
simply
to
establish
petitioner's
own
admissions,
his
own
statements
in
the
disbarment
proceeding.
and
what
the
judges
said
at
that
time,
and
merely
the
transcript
was
being
read
to
the
jury.
what
the
judges
said
at
that
time
was
context
for
petitioner's
own
admissions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
petitioner
himself,
mr.
justice
fortas,
admitted
that
the
recording
was
accurate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
but
the
jury
had
the
function
of
passing,
mr.
justice
fortas
on
the
entrapment
claim
and
on
the
claim
that
was
all
a
devious
plot
by
the
government.
this
was
really
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
the
elements
of
entrapment
are
both
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
government's
conduct
whether
we,
we
think
properly
that
the
jury
was
able
to
consider
how
fair,
how
devious
the
government's
conduct
may
have
been
in
all
these
meetings
between
vick
and
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
well,
our
position
is
that,
the
government,
when
it
did
equip
vick
with
a
tape
recorder,
was
in
a
dilemma
as
to
what
an
appropriate
investigative
step
would
be
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
we
think
it
had
an
evidentiary
reason
for
--
really
for
almost
three
separate
reasons.
we
think
one,
it
had
an
evidentiary
reason
because
it
was
proper
for
the
jury
to
consider
whether
in
the
course
of
dealings
between
petitioner
and
vick,
the
government
had
engaged
in
unlawful
activity.
that
enters
as
well
into
a
jury
determination
of
entrapment
that
this
court
has
in
its
entrapment
cases
called
attention
of
the
fact
that
when
the
government
uses
improper
persuasion,
improper
techniques
in
its
dealings
with
the
suspect,
then
that
may
very
well
be
part
of
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
called
course
of
conduct
in
such
that
the
conviction
should
be
invalidated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
propriety
or
impropriety
is
established
to
the
extent
that
it
shows
that
the
government
was
not
intending
to
use
the
recording
unless
it
had
received
the
authorization
of
the
district
judges.
in
other
words,
not
merely
the
authorization
but
just
the
fact
that
the
government
was
not
going
out
on
its
own
to
use
any
kind
of
investigative
method
that
it
could
think
of.
in
addition,
though,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
think
there
are
other
reasons,
other
evidentiary
reasons
for
the
judges'
testimony.
one
of
the
very
critical
issues
of
fact
before
the
jury
was
or
i
can't
say
it's
critical
because
our
view
that
even
in
the
petitioner's
testimony,
there
was
no
entrapment
for
the
jury
could
have
found
out.
but
one
of
the
very
important
issues
was,
was
vick
suggesting
to
the
petitioner
before
november
7
that
he
would
speak
to
his
cousin?
vick's
testimony
was
that
between
october
28
and
november
7,
he
didn't
know
such
thing.
now,
the
fact
that
on
november
8,
the
government
came
before
the
judges
and
submitted
to
the
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
an
affidavit
by
vick,
which
contain
nothing
more
than
a
relation
of
one
conversation,
a
conversation
of
a
day
or
before.
we
think
did
bear
on
the
issue
whether
there
had
been
a
whole
series
of
conversation
as
private.
if
petitioner
was
telling
the
truth
as
to
that
whole
series
of
dealings,
the
government
would
have
had
much
more
by
november
8
than
merely
one
conversation
by
vick
with
petitioner.
so
that
the
circumstances
of
the
affidavit,
and
let
me
say
the
affidavit
was
something
which
the
government
wanted
to
introduce
in
its
case
in
chief
but
to
which
the
petitioner
objected
at
that
time
because
vick
was
already
off
the
stand
and
the
judge
said,
“well,
you
can
only
introduce
it
if
you
put
vick
back
on
to
the
stand
to
identify
it.”
so,
if
the
affidavit
was
going
to
be
included
and
that,
we
think,
did
rebut
the
claim
that
there
had
been
a
series
of
discussions
prior
to
that,
but
if
the
affidavit
was
going
to
be
put
in
then
the
judge
had
to
be
put
on
to
identify
that
affidavit
and
to
say
yes
on
the
basis
of
that
affidavit
which
was
presented
to
mean
under
circumstances
under
which
it
was
presented
to
him.
he,
i
think,
did
some
official
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
that
was
a
factual
issue
before
the
jury.
there
was
a
critical
factual
issue
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
prosecutors
because
petitioner's
testimony,
of
course,
tried
to
bring
or
tried
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that
this
man
was
wiggling
and
persuading
him
over
a
whole
week
or
more
than
a
week
to
try
to
get
him
to
agree
to
bribe
the
juror.
so,
on
the
issue
of
dates,
on
the
issue
on
what
was
happening
between
october
28
and
november
7,
we
think
that
that
testimony
of
the
judges
was
both
proper
and
in
fact
necessary
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
no
written
order
but
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact
that
the
judges
did
in
fact
authorize.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
it
was
probably
just
based
on
the
judges'
view
that
they
could
preserve
the
integrity
of
their
own
bar
and
of
their
own
court.
it
was
--
the
judges
immediately,
when
they
first
called
petitioner
before
them,
view
this
as
a
disbarment
proceeding
as
an
inquiry
into
whether
an
officer
of
the
court
had
in
fact
been
attempting
to
corrupt
justice
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
and
i
think
the
judges
felt
this
was
part
of
their
function
in
the
orderly
preservation
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
district
of
course.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
remaining
major
contention
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
third
ground,
in
my
discussion
with
mr.
justice
fortas
i
think
sort
of
--
became
intertwine
with
the
second
and
that
is,
that
we
think
it's
perfectly
proper
in
any
entrapment
case
to
bring
before
the
jury
the
entire
course
of
the
government's
conduct.
in
other
words,
if
a
government
agency
is
accused
by
the
defendant
as
part
of
his
defense
of
entrapping
him,
then
we
think
the
jury
is
entitled
to
know
exactly
what
steps
the
government
has
taken
in
that
series
of
dealings
with
the
defendant.
and
what
the
government
did
before
vick
went
in
the
second
time
to
speak
to
petitioner
and
before
vick
went
in
the
third
time
to
speak
with
petitioner
is
we
think
an
appropriate
consideration
to
the
jury,
the
jury
ought
to
be
have
before
it
in
such
a
determination
the
entire
course
of
the
government's
conduct
from
beginning
to
end.
and
really,
petitioner's
claim
was
that
from
october
28
until
the
date
of
this
recording
on
november
11,
vick
was
engaged
in
a
continuous
entrapment
which
resulted
in
that
--
in
what
appeared
on
that
recording.
and
the
jury
could
barely
consider
on
determining
whether
he
was
exactly
why
he
went
in
on
november
8
and
we
think
the
judges
testimony
bore
on
why
he
went
in
there
to
speak
to
him
on
november
8
and
why
he
went
in
there
to
speak
to
petitioner
on
november
11.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
of
any,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course,
there
was.
i
really
don't
know
but
i
could
find
out
if
there
was.
i
haven't
really
addressed
my
attention
to
that.
if
you
like,
i
can
certainly
find
out
if
there
was
any
regulation
or
not.
i
don't
know
of
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
--
you
mean
whether
the
request
for
him
to
seek
tape
recording?
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
that
initiated
with
the
department.
but
the
department
of
justice,
nonetheless,
reluctant
to
do
it,
particularly
because
it
involved
an
officer
of
the
court
and
the
process
of
the
court
and
because
there
were
some,
of
course,
some
legal
issues
as
to
whether
it
would
be
permissible
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to
now.
but
the
department
of
justice
was
reluctant
to
do
without
approval
of
the
judges.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
think
that
would
just
have
been
hearsay.
in
other
words,
what
the
judges
testified
to
was
--
there
was
really
no
transcript
of
that
proceeding
before
the
judges.
the
judges
just
testified
to
what
had
happened,
i
guess
in
chambers,
when
the
government
prosecutors
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
a
government
prosecutor
who
came
before
the
judges,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
application
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
initiated
with
government
counsel,
yes,
with
the
prosecutor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
counsel,
i
guess
would
have
testified
to
what
the
government
had
done
there
in
chambers.
he
could
not
have
testified,
he
could
have
testified,
i
guess,
to
what
the
judge
said
to
him
but
not
to
the
judges
action
itself.
the
judge
himself,
the
judges
themselves
testified
that
they
did
have
this
question
before
them
and
that
they
did
approve
it.
i
request
what
is
in
the
judges'
mind.
the
reasons
that
they
approved
it
could
not
have
been
testified
to
by
government
counsels.
the
judges
in
effect
said
that
it
was
presented
to
them
and
because
--
they
recognized
that
it
was
an
investigative
dilemma,
they
approved,
they
authorized
the
recording.
that
--
the
fact
of
authorization
may
be
could
have
been
testified
to
by
government
counsel.
but
we
think
government
wasn't
required
to
be
limited
to
just
that
testimony
but
could
put
on
what
the
judges
themselves
thought
at
that
time
or
why
they
approved
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
authorization
itself
i
think
it
could
have
prove
it
against
him.
i
come
now
to
a
bundle
of
invasion
of
privacy
claim,
the
fourth
amendment
contentions.
but
before
discussing
them
in
detail,
i
think
it's
important
may
be
to
put
the
facts
in
some
practical
prospective.
the
record
establishes
that
on
december
of
1963,
vick
requested
a
meeting
with
walter
sheridan,
the
government
consultant,
and
reported
to
him
at
that
time
that
to
his
knowledge
petitioner
had
tried
to
bribe
at
least
one
juror
in
the
earlier
trial,
the
trial
back
in
1962.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
was
the
special
consultant
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
was
an
official
of
the
department
of
justice
who
was
a
special
consultant
to
the
--
i
used
the
word
“consultant”
just
to
shorten
his
title,
special
consultant
to
department
of
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh!
yes,
he
was
definitely.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
in
the
summer
of
july
or
august
of
1963
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
both
sheridan
and
vick
testified
it
was
some
place
late
july
and
early
or
early
august.
mr.
nathan
lewin
vick
went
to
sheridan.
he
called
sheridan
and
came
to
him
requesting
a
meeting
with
sheridan.
sheridan
was
then
in
nashville.
this
was
several
months
after
the
indictment
in
the
--
after
the
jury
bribery
indictment
which
gave
rise
to
the
case
which
immediately
followed
this
and
as
to
which
petitioner
was
representing
one
of
the
defendants.
vick
was
not
then
employed,
at
that
particular
moment
he
was
not
employed
by
petitioner.
but
vick
asked
for
meeting
with
sheridan.
it's
true
that
vick
--
prior
to
that,
just
to
clear
of
some
things
that
were
raised
in
petitioner's
argument,
it's
true
that
vick
have
had
prior
to
that,
spoken
with
the
fbi
and
had
been
told
that
at
the
time
he
was
employed
by
the
petitioner
that
the
fbi
was
not
speaking
to
him
because
he
was
employed
by
the
counsel
for
the
defendant.
mr.
nathan
lewin
vick's
first
conversation
with
sheridan
-
-
mr.
nathan
lewin
--was
about
an
attempt
that
petitioner
had
made
to
bribe
the
juror
in
the
1962
trial
when
he
was
representing
-
-
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
was
the
test
of
the
trial.
and
that
report
is
the
report
that
gave
rise
to
the
count
two
of
this
indictment
on
which
petitioner
was
acquitted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
a
weird
story.
that's
right.
now
at
that
time,
vick
reported
that
incident
and
was
told
by
sheridan
that
he
did
not,
sheridan
did
not
want
to
hear
from
him
any
information
about
anything
other
than
illegal
activity
which
was
specifically
told
to
reporter.
he
wanted
to
continue
providing
information,
report
information,
only
about
illegal
activity
and
nothing
about
anything
else.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
was
not
employed
but
it
was
known
that
he
had
previously
been
employed
by
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
known
--
well,
in
relation
to
the
forthcoming
trial
or
in
relation
to
anything
he'd
known
in
the
past
about
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
at
that
time
--
well,
there
was
reason,
of
course,
in
relation
to
mr.
osborn
as
well
because
there
was
reason
on
the
basis
of
vick's
report
that
osborn
had
attempted
to
bribe
the
juror
in
the
earlier
trial
to
believe
that
he
might
be
involved
in
similar
attempts
in
the
forthcoming
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
no
discussion
of
any
particular
renewal
of
relationship
and
there's
nothing
that
i
know
of
in
the
record
or
in
any
place
outside
the
record
to
suggest
that
--
well
in
the
record,
it
specifically
deny,
both
vick
and
sheridan
specifically
deny,
that
sheridan
had
in
any
way
requested
him
to
be
employed
by
petitioner
or
that
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
seek
employment
or
in
--
but,
it
was
known
that
vick
have
had
a
various
associations
with
petitioner
with
other
people
who
were
investigating
for
petitioner.
and
maybe,
we're
engaging
possibly
in
similar
kind
of
activity.
and
in
that
light,
sheridan
thought
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
ask.
but
if
there
was
any
other
evidence
of
unlawful
activity,
it
would
be
brought
to
his
attention.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
forthcoming
trial
was
the
trial
which
resulted
in
the
convictions
which
are
up
here
on
the
next
case.
we
are
going
to
follow
this
one.
in
other
words,
those
petitioners
had
been,
and
one
other,
those
petitioners
and
another
defendant
had
been
indicted
in
may
of
1963
on
those
charges
and
the
trial
was
pending
at
that
time.
now,
in
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
he
was
working
out
in
the
open,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
was
--
at
least
to
the
extent
that
he
was
investigating
jurors.
he
was
going
to
people
who
i
guess
who
knew
them
or
would
know
them
and
asking
about
them.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
generally
known
to
the
police
department.
i
don't
think
and
it
was
certainly
not
generally
known
to
the
federal
government.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
possibly
to
those
whom
he
was
asking.
i
don't
think
he
was
disguising
his
identity
when
he
was
asking
anybody
what
they
knew
about
prospective
jurors.
he
didn't
report
it
to
either
his
superior
or
to
the
federal
government
but
he
nor
right,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
on
the
record
or
anything
that
i
know
which
indicate
that
he
was
in
anyway
disguising
his
identity
when
he
was
making
this
investigation.
it
was
something
that
he
was
--
i
guess
he
might
say
it
was
sort
of
in
between.
it
wasn't
really
an
undercover
work
but
it
wasn't
a
sort
of
thing
he
was
reporting
regularly
to
his
superior.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
at
the
time
of
the
test
pretrial
of
this
investigating
jury.
no,
we
found
out
about
that
afterwards.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes!
the
government
found
out
after
the
test
pretrial
that
he
had
been
conducting
such
investigations
and
petitioner
had
retained
him
from
that,
yes.
now,
the
record
here
contains
the
testimony,
record
on
this
case
on
page
32-b
which
is
the
last
two
pages
of
the
record
contains
the
testimony
of
the
government
prosecutor
that
vick's
allegation
as
to
petitioner's
attempt
to
bribe
the
juror
in
the
1962
trial
was
considered
by
him
too
incredible
that
even
warrant,
he
is
authorizing
any
further
investigation
of
that
attempt.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
and
on
page
32-b,
the
prosecutor
testified
that
he
--
that
he
said
when
that
matter
was
brought
to
my
attention
i
said:
“there's
nothing
to
that.
don't
go
into
that
because
the
petitioner's
reputation
as
a
member
of
the
tennessee
bar”.
so
that
we
had,
as
of
the
summer
of
1963,
a
report
by
vick
is
to
an
attempt
to
bribe
the
jury
in
the
earlier
case
which
the
government
at
that
point
believes
too
incredible
to
even
warrant
investigation.
then,
vick
returns,
calls
and
said
that
he
has
been
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
on
--
in
october
there
was
a
report
in
the
record,
and
this
was
a
report
that
mr.
kossman
was
referring
to
in
october
in
which
vick
told
someone.
it's
not
clear
that
he
told
this
to
sheridan.
it
appears
more
likely
that
he
told
to
the
fbi
agents;
that
he'd
seen
the
jury
list
and
on
the
jury
list
was
his
cousin,
elliot
and
somebody
else
was
in
there.
and
just
that
report
that
those
are
the
people
on
the
jury.
now,
both
vick
and
sheridan
unequivocally
denied
that
they
have
ever
discussed
or
that
sheridan
did
ever
suggested
to
vick
or
that
vick
ever
suggested
to
sheridan
before
november
7
that
he
would
mention
to
petitioner
that
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury.
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
vick
did
make
the
statement
on
november
7,
and
in
no
way
suggested
or
requested
by
the
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
this
was
october
21st.
october
21st,
this
was
a
week
before
he
was
mr.
osborn's
employee.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
that
was
unequivocally
denied
that,
that
both
sheridan
and
vick
that
there
was
any
suggestion
at
that
time
that
he
get
in
mr.
osborn's
employee
or
that
he
attempts
to
in
anyway
even
to
speak
with
osborn.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
report
had
nothing
to
do
with
osborn
at
all.
that
report
simply
states
that
in
looking
over
the
jury
list,
vick
said
that
he
was
a
cousin
of
eliot
and
that
he
knew
another
one
of
the
jurors,
prospective
jurors
on
the
list.
that's
the
report
of
october
21st.
and
vick's
testimony
of
the
trial,
mr.
kossman
said
that
he
kept
denying
that
he
discussed
his
relationship
with
his
cousin
with
anybody
in
the
government.
well,
the
denial
of
vick's
were
that
the
questions
which
asked
him
whether
he
had
discussed
with
anyone
in
the
government
the
possibility
which
was
mentioned
to
osborn,
to
the
petitioner,
his
relationship
with
his
cousin.
not
that
he
had
denied
mentioning
to
the
government
his
relationship
with
his
cousin.
we
fully
agree
and
vick
never
denied
it
that
he
did
tell
the
government
on
october
21st
that
he
was
related
to
elliott;
that
elliot
was
a
cousin.
and
that's
all,
that's
what
he
ultimately
said
to
osborn.
of
course,
if
this
relates
somewhat
to
the
entrapment
claim
that
that
was
entrapment,
vis-à-vis
the
petitioner,
it
should
have
been
entrapped
vis-à-vis
the
government
and
i
suggest
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
week
later,
he
was
employed
by
osborn.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
circumstances
of
that
are
that
vick
agreed
the
trial
without
dispute
that
he
sought
employment
for
osborn
because
he
was
financially
--
in
financial
strife
and
he
wanted
to
have
added
income.
and
that's
what
he
testified
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
evidence
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
no
evidence
on
the
record
whatever.
and
after
he
received
employment
from
vick,
he
did
report
to
the
government
that
he
had
from
petitioner
rather,
vick
did
report
to
the
government
had
been
employed
by
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
immediately
on
the
same
day.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
now
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
not,
did
not
really
go,
we
think,
to
any
attempt
by
the
government
to
find
out
whether
petitioner
was
trying
to
bribe
juror.
so,
that
he
can't
deny
that.
the
government
may,
you
know,
to
the
extent
that
osborn,
so
that
vick
may
have
learned
such
things
sheridan
could've
request
him
to
report
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
reported
that
to
sheridan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
recall
any
testimony
to
that
regard
but
we
don't
dispute
that
the
instruction
back
in
the
summer
continued.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
that
was
relevant,
if
i
may
just
make
a
point,
that
was
relevant
because
it's
entirely
clear
from
petitioner's
own
testimony
that
he
knew,
and
vick
had
told
him
that
vick
on
his
meeting
with
sheridan
back
in
the
summer,
had
promised
sheridan
that
he
would
not,
no
longer
accept
employment
from
petitioner.
on
page
458
of
the
record
at
the
very
top,
petitioner
testifies
that
he
had
told
me
that
he
promised
walter
sheridan
that
if
mr.
sheridan
would
let
him
alone,
he
would
never
work
for
me
again.
he
had
reported
that
to
me.
in
other
words,
vick
had
spoken
to
sheridan
in
summer
and
said,
“now,
i'm
telling
you
this
report
about
what
happened
in
the
past.
i
won't
be
employed
by
osborn
anymore.”
now,
in
october
28,
he
again
accepts
employment
from
osborn
and
he
then
calls
sheridan.
now
that
could
just
as
well
been
attributable
to
the
fact
that
he
promised
sheridan
that
he
wouldn't
accept
employment
from
osborn
and
yet
turned
around
to
vick
as
any
attempt
to
convey
information
to
the
government
and
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
any
illegal
activity,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
nothing
was
illegal
about
him
finally.
it
was
merely
in
agreement
--
well,
but
it
was
a
violation
of
his
agreement
as
it
were
not
to
be
employed
by
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
he
reported
that
because
he
had
told
sheridan
that
he
wouldn't
do
this
and
like
he
may
very
well
felt
that
now
here,
he
was
in
effect
violating
what
he
had
promised
sheridan,
he
ought
to
it,
he's
dealing
fairly
with
sheridan
now,
report
to
him
that
because
of
his
financial
circumstances
or
whatever
reason,
he
felt
that
necessary
again
to
take
employment
from
the
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
on
page
458.
now,
that's
petitioner
testimony
that
he
knew,
that
petitioner
knew
that
vick
had
spoken
with
sheridan
and
he
promised
sheridan
not
to
be
in
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
have
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
that
was,
well,
what
vick
was
then
suggesting
to
the
fbi
was
that
he
would
be
reporting
i
guess
all
sorts
of
things.
and
the
fbi
felt
that
at
that
point,
first
of
all,
at
that
point,
there
was
never
any
suggestion
that
petitioner
had
ever
tried
to
bribe
the
juror.
so,
certainly,
the
interest
of
law
enforcement
in
having
vick
speak
to
petitioner
and
then
report
to
the
fbi
which
was
very
farfetched
because
the
only
interest
presumably,
the
only
thing
that
would
have
been
gained
from
to
that
point
would
have
been
defense
threat.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
government
has
always
tried
to,
not
to
do
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
following
this.
in
other
words,
the
fbi
felt
that
at
that
point,
any
communications
between
vick
and
federal
agents
could
serve
no
lawful
purpose,
or
very,
very
slight
purpose
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think
he
did.
he
still
was
interested
only
in
unlawful
activity
and
that
was,
we
think,
a
request
that
the
fbi
could
have
made
and
that's
what
we
think
is
something
--
that's
in
effect
the
man
that's
made
of
every
citizen
to
report
unlawful
activity.
but
at
that
time
vick
came
to
the
fbi
and
asked
or
proposed
a
certain
arrangement
with
them,
the
chances
of
receiving
information
of
unlawful
activity
and
the
dangers
of
receiving
things
which
were
not
information
of
unlawful
activity,
when
balanced,
were
so
substantially
against
receiving
information
from
vick
that
the
government
or
the
fbi
at
that
point
said,
“well,
we
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.”
now,
since
that
time,
of
course,
vick
had
reported
an
attempt
to
bribe
the
juror
in
that
earlier
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
it's
the
essence.
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
was,
he
could
in
fact
instruct
the
fbi
what
to
do,
right?
now,
vick
then
comes
to
the
government
on
november
7
and
calls
up
sheridan
and
says
now
petitioner
has
attempted,
osborn
has
--
when
i
mentioned
that
my
cousin
was
on
the
jury,
osborn
suggested
that
i
offer
a
bribe
to
him.
and
the
question,
what
was
the
government
to
do
in
these
circumstances?
if
petitioner
plan
to
meet
vick
and
discuss
these
things
in
the
future,
the
furtherance
of
this
endeavor,
there
was,
it
was
clear
that
the
meetings
would
be
between
the
two
of
them
alone.
there
would
no
way
to
determine
whether
vick's
story
was
truthful
other
than
to
permit
him
to
corroborate
it
by
carrying
voluntarily
a
recording
device
which
would
record
one
conversation
and
one
conversation
only
between
himself
and
the
other
party
to
that
conversation.
since
the
problem
concerned,
the
integrity
of
justice
in
that
court,
it
was
appropriate
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
district
judges
and
to
meet
standards
which
those
members
of
this
court
who
have
expressed
the
view
that
and
to
seeking
justification
before
a
magistrate
to
be
obtained
before
such
a
recording
be
made
by
a
government
agent.
the
prosecutors
in
this
case
went
to
the
judges
and
sought
authorization.
now,
we
think
that
that
course,
having
sought
authorization
from
the
judges,
having
attempted
to
get
corroborative
information
from
only
one
conversation,
we
think
the
practical
necessities
in
this
case
are
quite
as
compelling
as
the
fact
of
necessity
to
which
the
chief
justice
adverted
to
in
the
lopez
case.
here,
we
have
a
police
officer,
his
credibility
is
put
in
question
who
will
be
challenged
as
to
his
conversations
with
a
lawyer
of
longstanding
simply
on
a
one
to
one
basis.
the
jury
would
just
simply
be
presented
by
a
conflicting
testimony
which
it
could
not
resolve
to
accept
in
favor
of
the
man
who
had
a
better
reputation.
and
indeed,
petitioner's
own
reputation
was
at
stake.
was
the
government
merely
on
vick's
word
to
indict
petitioner
and
put
him
to
trial
in
order
to
present
that
issue
to
the
jury?
we
submit
that
the
only
realistic,
practical
course
was
to
take
this
very
limited
step
of
providing
corroborative
information
in
these
circumstances.
now,
if
i
might
just
very,
very
briefly
refer
to
some
of
the
contentions
or
major
contentions
made
by
the
amicus
in
this
case
and
which
also
lapse
over
into
the
claims
made
in
the
succeeding
cases.
the
fourth
amendment
certainly
wasn't
violated
by
vick's
being
there
in
petitioner's
office
and
speaking
with
him.
indeed,
when
petitioner
and
vick
wanted
the
greatest
amount
of
secrecy
or
the
greatest
amount
of
confidentiality,
between
themselves,
the
record
while
conclusively
demonstrates
this,
they
went
out
unto
the
street,
into
the
alley,
next
to
their
office
to
speak
with
each
other.
they
were
not
relying
in
any
way.
in
other
words,
our
proposition
is
short
with
regards
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
is
that,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
violated
when
a
government
informant
repeat
statements
made
to
him
by
defendant
even
if
those
statements
are
made
in
the
fourth
amendment
enclosure.
that's
because
the
disclosure
of
the
statement,
that
would
someone
makes
to
me,
there
is
no
relation
to
where
it
is
we
happen
to
be
standing.
if
my
best
friend
tells
me
something
in
the
privacy
of
his
home,
he
relied
on
that
privacy
to
keep
out
of
eavesdroppers,
to
keep
out
eavesdroppers
but
not
to
keep
me
up.
and
he
only
relies
on
my
trustworthiness
not
to
repeat
what
i,
he
said
to
me.
my
reputation
doesn't
in
anyway
violate
the
privacy
at
home.
the--
if
i
might
just
have
one
minute
to
respond
to
the
claim
that
the,
that
the
judicial
authorization
was
improper
which
petitioner
makes
a
substantial
to
do
in
his
petitioner,
we
think
it's
a
rather
remarkable
claim
since
it's
quite
clear
that
the
government
was
taking
them
more
precautionary
course
which
attempting
to
protect
the
petitioner's
right
when
it
went
to
the
judges
in
the
first
instance
and
sought
authorization
rather
than
taking
this
step
entirely
on
its
own.
and
the
circumstances
under
which
the
recording
were
made,
both
in
terms
of
the
limitation
as
to
time
and
as
to
place
and
as
to
conversation
and
as
to
prior
authorization,
we
think,
warrant
certainly
not
justified
condemnation
of
the
government's
conduct
under
this
court's
decision
in
lopez
or
in
of
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
conviction
of
petitioner,
a
member
of
the
tennessee
bar
since
1940
on
count
1
of
an
indictment
alleging
violations
of
the
general
obstruction
of
justice
statute,
18
u.s.c.
1503.
in
the
count
on
which
he
was
convicted,
petitioner
was
charged
with
having
requested
and
directed
one
robert
vick,
a
nashville
police
officer,
who
he
had
retained
to
investigate
prospective
jurors
to
offer
a
$10,000
bribe
to
a
cousin
of
vick's,
who
was
a
potential
juror
in
a
trial
on
which
petitioner
was
scheduled
to
represent
one
of
then
five
defendants.
the
charges
on
which
the
defendants
were
being
tried
involved
four
other
endeavors,
corruptly
who
approached
jurors
in
an
earlier
criminal
trial.
and
those
charges
resulted
in
the
convictions
of
five
defendants.
four
of
whom
are
before
the
court
in
the
case
immediately
--
to
be
argued
immediately
following
this
one
and
on
the
fifth
of
which,
the
case
on
the
fifth
that
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
last
term
and
denied
with
a
petition
for
rehearing
just
this
past
monday.
the
government's
evidence
at
petitioner's
trial
consisted
essentially
of
the
testimony
of
vick,
the
police
officer;
corroboration
of
that
testimony
in
the
form
of
a
tape
recording
of
the
last
of
three
conversations
between
petitioner
and
vick
on
that
subject
and
third,
petitioner's
admissions,
partly
false
exculpatory
statements
which
he
made
in
the
course
of
the
disbarment
proceedings
which
were
conducted
in
the
federal
district
court
in
nashville
very
shortly
after
the
events
at
issue
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
in
a
federal
district
court,
yes.
proceedings
in
the
state,
to
disbar
him
in
the
--
from
practice
in
the
state
court
have
--
are
still
pending.
and,
i
imagine,
really
being
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
argument
in
this
case.
petitioner's
sole
defense
at
his
trial
was
entrapment
based
largely
on
the
claim
that
the
entire
course
of
conduct
was
part
of
a
government
plot
intended
to
disqualify
him
from
representing
james
hoffa
in
the
forthcoming
trial
on
obstruction
of
justice
charges.
that
issue
of
entrapment
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
to
which
petitioner
did
not
object
at
his
trial
and
to
which
he
has
interposed
only
the
most
technical
and
minor
challenges
which
we
rebut
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
since
the
entrapment
question
was
the
major
focus
of
trial
and
since
petitioner's
other
major
contentions
are
related
in
some
way
to
the
cases
that
immediately
followed
this
one,
it
will
be
more
exhaustively
discussed
in
certain
ways.
in
those
cases,
i
would
like
with
the
court's
permission
to
direct
my
argument,
first
to
the
entrapment
issue
and
then
in
turn
to
the
fourth
amendment
claims
relating
to
the
recording
and
insofar
as
the
issues
in
succeeding
cases
here
involved
to
those
issues
as
well.
and
i
would
leave
for
conclusion
for
such
time
which
has
left
petitioner's
final
contention
which
is
not
at
all
discussed
in
mr.
kossman's
oral
argument
that
there
was
no
obstruction
of
--
no
violation
of
the
statute
here
because
the
attempt
was
“factually
impossible.”
the
principle
contention
relative
to
entrapment
is
that
the
evidence
established
that
defense
so
conclusively
that
the
issue
should
not
even
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
now
there
are,
of
course,
instances
in
which
this
court
has
held,
particularly
in
sherman
versus
united
states
in
356
u.s.
that
that
course
is
appropriate.
this
case,
both
on
the
testimony
of
vick
and
we
submit
even
on
the
testimony
of
petitioner
as
to
what
happened
between
vick
and
himself
is
not
one
of
those
cases.
the
facts
are
not
really
complex
but
before
even
turning
to
those,
i
think
it's
important
to
dispose
of
a
basic
misapprehension
which
runs
through
petitioner's
brief
and
through
the
oral
argument.
one
of
the
much
debated
issues
at
trial
or
at
least
debated
to
some
extent
was
whether
vick
was
an
agent
of
the
government
in
november
whether
he
was
an
undercover
informant
as
of
that
time.
and
petitioner's
counsel
attempted
on
various
occasions
to
get
vick
to
admit
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
federal
government
when
he
was
speaking
with
petitioner
or
indeed
when
he
accepted
employment
from
petitioner
in
october
of
1963.
now,
the
extent
of
vick's
agency
in
that
respect,
whether
he
had
been
deputized
by
the
federal
government
was
certainly
an
element
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
in
determining
whether
there
was
any
substance
to
petitioner's
claim
that
this
was
part
of
large
plot
by
the
government
to
entrapment
into
making
statements.
but
we
submit
that
on
--
the
issue
now
before
the
court
as
to
whether
there
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
question
is
really
not
seriously
involved
because
even
if
the
jury
had
concluded
on
the
testimony
that
vick
had
been
deputized
by
the
federal
government
or
had
been
told
to
speak
to
osborn,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
defense
of
entrapment
would
not
be
made
out
because
the
conversations
between
petitioner
and
vick
were
such
that
--
under
vick's
version,
they
couldn't
know
if
it
amount
to
entrapment
and
under
petitioners
they
would
at
most
amount
even
if
made
directly
to
a
paid
agent
of
the
government
who
isn't
in
the
employ
of
the
federal
government.
they
would
at
most
amount
to
an
issue
that
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
they
were
a
standard
form
of
instructions,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
that
the
jury
was
told
that
if
--
and
an
instruction
in
toto,
i
might
say,
appears
in
two
paragraphs
on
page
697
of
the
record.
and
in
short,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
idea
of
committing
the
crime
that
--
instructed
jury
that
unlawful
entrapment
amounted
to
a
course
of
conduct
on
which
the
government
originated
the
idea
of
committing
the
crime
and
without
any
prior
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
commit
it,
he
had
been
urged
and
induced
by
the
government
so
to
commit
it.
and
if
the
jury
so
found
it
was
instructed
to
--
find
the
defendant
not
guilty.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
of
course
the
defendant
didn't
object
to
that
particular
use
of
the
words.
i
think
really
what
he
meant
was
government
conduct
which
amounts
to
what
this
court
has
called
“providing
an
opportunity
for
the
commission
of
crime”
and
in
the
court
--
this
court
in
sherman
spoke
of
drawing
the
line
between
a
trap
for
the
unwary
criminal
and
a
trap
for
the
unwary
innocent.
and
i
think
that's
really
what
the
court
meant
that
lawful
entrapment
would
amount
to
a
trap
for
the
unwary
criminal.
unlawful
entrapment
of
course
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary
innocent,
a
man
who
would
not
otherwise
have
a
disposition
to
commit
the
offense,
commits
it
only
because
the
government
has
urged
and
induced
them
to
do
so.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
never
heard
of
it
before
either
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
think
from
the
whole
context
of
the
instruction
its
quite
clear
that
the
court
was
really
intending
to
warn
the
jury
that
it
need
not
acquit
the
defendant
merely
because
he
fell
into
a
government
trap.
the
government
may
use
a
trap.
and
that's
--
and
possibly
the
use
of
the
word
“entrapment”
might
otherwise
under
the
standard
instruction
in
some
way
confuse
the
jury
into
the
believing
that
if
there
was
any
trap
laid
then
the
defendant
must
be
acquitted.
on
--
just
on
the
question
of
vick's
agency
vis-à-vis,
the
federal
government,
and
to
clear
up
some
matters
that
were
raised
during
petitioners
argument,
i
think
i
should
make
clear
that
there
were
some
discussions
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
vick
was
drawing
his
salary.
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
incidence
in
question
in
this
case,
at
the
time
that
he
was
speaking
to
petitioner,
and
been
hired
by
petitioner
to
do
investigative
work,
he
was
in
no
way
drawing
any
salary
from
the
federal
government
nor
has
he
ever
drawn
any
salary
from
the
federal
government.
the
testimony
which
mr.
kossman
referred
was
testimony
relating
to
what
vick
was
doing
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
trial.
now
as
of
that
time,
in
preparation
for
that
trial
and
presumably
because
he
was
then
being
called
on
to
be
interviewed,
and
maybe
appear
before
grand
jury,
he
was
excused
from
a
state
or
city
service
and
was
on
assignment
in
that
section
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
far
as
i
know,
at
the
time
of
the
incidence,
he
was.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
to
rebut
the
fact
that
he
was.
he
did
testify
that
he
was
a
police
officer.
he
had
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
mr.
nathan
lewin
moonlighting,
doing
investigative
work
on
the
side.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
he
was
doing
it
all
the
time
i
gather
during
that
earlier
trial
and
for
--
or
at
least
the
first
part
of
the
earlier
trial
in
the
fall
of
1962.
again
in
around
january
or
february
of
1963,
again
for
that
short
period
of
time
that
petitioner
retained
him
in
the
summer
of
1963
and
then
again
in
october
of
1963.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they're
all
--
very
all
--
a
very
definite
short
periods,
several
weeks,
several
--
maybe
a
month
or
month
and
a
half.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
doesn't
appear
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
i
understand
he
was
paid
by
the
day.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
imagine
must
be
an
eight
hour
day,
maybe
he
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
record
doesn't
show.
i
don't
think
exactly
how
it
was.
(inaudible)
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know.
apparently,
it
was
not
a
matter
that
he
had
gone
into
any
detail
at
the
trial
so
i
suspect
that
is
--
it's
not
considered
that
unusual
maybe
in
nashville.
but
i
know
that
it
is
a
rather
surprising
fact.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
records
don't
show
that,
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
do
show
definitely
though
that
osborn
knew
as
of
the
fall
of
1963
that
he
had
even
spoken
to
sheridan
--
petitioner
himself
testified
that
he
had
spoken
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
record
shows
that
he
was
recommended
by
one
ramsey,
who
was
also
an
investigator
for
vick.
it
may
--
i'm
really
not
sure.
i
think
it
does
show
that
he
was.
that
he
did
know
that
he
is
a
police
officer.
i
don't
think
it
was
a
secret.
i
don't
think
anybody
who
was
there
in
the
investigation
of
--the
whole
team
of
investigators
was
not
acquainted
with
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes,
you
are
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
about
the
fall
of
'62,
right.
i
think
certainly
--
definitely
by
the
time
of
the
events
here,
osborn
must
have
known,
that's
right
from
that
state.
the
principal
question
on
entrapment
under
this
court's
and
lower
courts
decision
of
course
is,
in
--
this
is
the
question
that
arise
as
nearly
all
the
entrapment
cases
is
what
the
conduct
of
the
entrapper
is
vis-à-vis,
the
one
who
claims
to
be
entrapped.
in
other
words,
the
dozens
or
scores
of
entrapment
cases
all
involve
government
employees
who
engaged
in
undercover
capacity,
who
speak
to
a
defendant
and
the
question
is
whether
they
induced
the
defendant
to
commit
the
crime
or
whether
the
defendant
himself
was
disposed
so
to
do
and
all
that
the
entrapper
did
was
provide
him
with
the
opportunity
to
perform
and
commit
that
particular
crime.
and
that
we
submit
is
what
the
central
issue
is
before
this
court
at
this
juncture
whether
in
his
conduct
with
petitioner,
vick
induced
somebody
who
was
willing
to
perform
the
crime
and
looking
for
an
approach
to
a
juror
to
perform
it
or
whether
he
under
the
--
oh,
under
the
evidence
that
were
submitted
to
the
jury
or
under
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
inducing
the
commission
of
a
crime.
we
think
that
vick's
testimony
makes
it
entirely
clear
and
vick's
testimony
certainly
could
be
believed
by
the
jury
and
under
this
court
decision
in
the
masciale
case
in
356
u.s.,
the
jury
was
free
to
believe
vick's
testimony
and
vick's
testimony
was
that
it
required
nothing
more
to
get
petitioner
to
suggest
to
him
an
approach
to
a
juror
than
the
mere
statement
on
november
the
7th
of
1963,
“i
have
a
cousin
on
the
jury.”
and
that
statement
was
true.
and
it
caused
petitioner
to
go
out
into
the
alley
with
him
or
out
on
the
alley
near
his
office
with
him
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
approach
that
juror.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
concluding
my
argument
on
the
entrapment
issue,
i
would
only
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
several
particular
circumstances
arising
out
of
the
record
in
this
case
which
strongly
support
the
jury's
conclusion
of
no
entrapment
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
including
petitioner's
own
testimony.
and
they
are
first
that
in
passing
on
the
entrapment
claim,
the
jury
was
certainly
entitled
to
consider
who
it
is,
who
was
alleged
to
have
been
entrapping
whom,
a
policeman
of
less
than
one
year's
experience
allegedly
entrapping
in
three
or
five
or
six
meetings
according
to
petitioner,
an
attorney
of
more
than
20
years
standing.
and
this
is
a
defense
which
the
jury
was
certainly
entitled
to
view
with
skepticism
in
light
of
the
kind
of
case
that
was
involved
or
in
light
of
the
charges
as
to
which
the
petitioner
was
defending
in
the
forthcoming
trial
which
for
themselves
obstruction
of
justice
charges
or
attempts
to
bribe
jurors.
it's
hard
to
be
likely
that
an
attorney
in
those
circumstances
would
be
readily
and
even
half
a
dozen
meetings
entrapped
into
making
this
kind
of
an
offer.
in
addition,
it
appears
quite
clear
from
petitioner's
own
testimony
that
he
was
the
one
who
was
instructing,
on
the
very
fine
details
of
jury
bribery.
according
to
his
own
testimony,
by
the
third
or
fourth
meeting
he
was
advising
vick
that
the
way
to
bribe
a
juror
was
to
pay
half
down
and
half
later
or
that
the
best
way
to
find
out
whether
prospective
juror
would
take
to
be
bribed
would
be
to
ask
him
he
wanted
and
then
double
the
amount.
and
that
appears
from
petitioner's
own
testimony.
and
then
the
final
and
conclusive
bit
of
evidence
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
very
persuasive
which
i
think
the
jury
certainly
was
entitled
to
find
almost
conclusive
was
the
reading
of
the
transcript
of
november
11
that
which
appears
at
pages
5
through
8
of
our
brief.
the
--
merely
reading
of
that
transcript,
we
believe,
discloses
makes
it
entirely
clear
in
the
dealings
between
petitioner
and
vick,
exactly
who
it
is,
who
was
the
svengali
and
who
it
is
who
was
trilby.
it's
quite
clear
from
that
conversation
that
vick
was
reporting
to
his
master
and
asking
his
advice
as
to
what
steps
to
take
next.
in
light
of
all
that
evidence,
of
course,
we
are
not
contending
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
but
in
light
of
all
that
proof,
our
burden
is
certainly
satisfied
sufficiently
to
warrant
the
submission
of
the
issue
of
entrapment
to
the
jury
under
proper
instructions
and
that's
what
we've
done
in
this
case.
let
me
now
turn
to
the
petitioner's
subsidiary
challenge
on
the
entrapment
issue
which
is
the
rebuttal
testimony
introduced
in
answer
to
the
entrapment
claim
was
improper.
petitioner
focuses
on
the
two
bits
of
rebuttal
testimony
which
are
the
affidavit
of
vick
in
which
he
related
according
to
his
story
the
conversation
that
he
had
with
petitioner
on
november
7
which
was,
according
to
vick,
the
very
first
time
that
he
ever
mentioned
to
petitioner
that
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury
and
the
judges
testimony
that
they
had
authorized
that
recording.
now
i
think
it's
important,
just
preliminarily,
that
to
make
clear
that
the
judges
in
no
way
testified
that
they
believed
that
petitioner
was
guilty
of
attempting
to
bribe
the
juror.
their
testimony
was
very
severely
limited.
the
government
did
not
attempt
to
introduce
any
opinion,
evidence
of
their
part
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
in
any
way.
they
testified
merely
as
to
what
was
done
on
november
8:
that
the
government
prosecutors
came
to
them,
advice
them
that
they
had
an
affidavit
from
a
man
who
said
that
petitioner
was
attempting
to
bribe
the
juror
and
that
the
government
didn't
know
what
do
to
in
those
circumstances
and
that
the
prosecutors
themselves
could
not,
in
light
of
the
petitioner's
good
reputation,
in
light
of
petitioners
standing
in
the
national
bar
did
not
know
whether
to
credit
the
story.
when
the
judges
testified
that
having
read
the
affidavit,
they
authorized
the
prosecutors
to
send
vick
back
in
with
a
tape
recording.
now,
the
judges'
testimony
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
reason,
mr.
justice
harlan
was
really
because
the
prosecutors
realized
that
this
was
a
matter
going
into
the
integrity
of
justice
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
if
the
government
had
been
seeking
merely
the
equivalent
of
a
search
warrant,
and
that
was
also
part
of
our
purpose
in
court,
but
if
they'd
been
seeking
merely
the
equivalent
of
the
search
warrant,
then
of
course,
it
would
have
been
adequate
to
go
to
one
judge
or
to
a
commissioner.
but
since
this
was
a
matter
which
went
-
-
both
because
it
involve
an
officer
of
the
court
and
because
it
involve
charges
of
jury
entrapping,
it
went
to
the
integrity
of
justice,
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
that
court,
the
government
felt
it
was
appropriate
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
-
-
and
affect
the
whole
court
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
which
was
both
federal
district
judges.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they
both
had.
well,
the
jury
panel
would
have
been
judge,
as
an
initial
matter,
the
case
was
assigned
to
judge
gray
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
because
judge
miller
had
refused
himself.
but
there
was
a
possibility
that
if
judge
gray's
panel
had
been
exhausted,
that
the
jury
panel
in
judge
miller's
courtroom
would
be
called
upon
to
serve
on
judge
gray.
so
that
they
work
to
that
extent,
both
interested
because
they
both
had
jury
panel
which
might
serve
on
that
trial.
but
i
think
the
main
reason
why
it's
just
that
the
government
felt
that
this
was
something
which
the
entire
court
of
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
should
have
before
it,
before
the
government
took
further
steps
to
determine
whether
the
allegations
were
true
or
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
judges'
testimony?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
defendant's
evidence
and
the
defendant
had
presented
evidence
in
which
he
attempted,
the
petitioner
attempted
to
show
that
this
was
all
vick's
discussions
with
him
were
all
part
of
entrapment
scheme
and
plot
on
the
government
to
get
him,
to
ensnare
him
into
making
this
statement.
the
government
then
in
rebuttal,
at
the
conclusion
on
defendant's
evidence
put
on
judge,
first
judge
gray
to
testify
and
then
judge
miller
to
testify
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
obtaining
of
the
recording.
we
feel
that
this
was
perfectly
proper
rebuttal
evidence
really
for
three
reasons,
because
it
went
to
three
issues
which
we
think
were
raised
by
petitioner's
own
testimony,
by
petitioner's
own
defense
which
we
could
not,
which
the
government
could
not
have
anticipated
as
part
of
his
direct
case
but
which
is,
which
was
perfectly
proper
to
rebut
as
part
of,
of
course
in
government's
rebuttal.
and
those
three
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
tape
recording,
as
part
of
the
government's
original
case,
vick
testified
and
he
just
merely
testified
that
he
had
a
discussion
with
petitioner
on
november
7;
that
thereafter,
he
was
equipped
with
the
tape
recorder
and
had
another
discussion
with
petitioner
on
november
8
when
apparently
the
tape
recorder
did
not
work.
and
that
he
was
again
equipped
with
the
tape
recorder
on
november
11
and
the
tape
recording
then
did
work.
he
then
identified
the
tape
and
the
fbi
agents
identified
the
tape
and
the
tape
recording
was
put
into
evidence
as
part
of
the
government's
original
case
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
vick
as
to
his
discussions
with
the
petitioner.
now,
petitioner
in
his
case,
in
his
defense
testified
that
this
whole
course
of
conduct,
vick's
discussions
with
him
were
part
of
a
government
plot
intended
to
ensnare
him
into
making
statements
and
into
offering
a
bribe
to
a
juror.
and,
it
was
petitioner's
version
that
vick
first
began
mentioning
his
relationship
to
the
juror
on
october
28
when
he
was
retained
by
petitioner
and
that
vick
then
returned
on
the
following
day.
and
again,
three
or
four
days
later
and
suggested
that
each
time
that
he
would
first,
the
first
time
that
he
would
speak
with
his
cousin
and
on
the
third
visit
that
he
had
spoken
with
his
cousin
and
that
his
cousin
is
willing
to
accept
the
bribe.
now,
of
course,
petitioner's
own
testimony
admitted
that
he
met
the
suggestion
only
--
responded
to
the
suggestion
only
weakly
and
didn't
really
offer
any
resistance
that
by
the
third
meeting
he
was
instructing
vick
on
exactly
how
to
go
about
bribing
the
juror.
but
nonetheless,
there
was
presented
to
the
jury
as
a
conclusion
of
the
defendant's
case,
a
clear
dispute
in
the
testimony
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
vick
between
october
28
and
november
7,
which
was
date
when
vick
claim
that
he
first
had
a
discussion
with
petitioner
about
his
cousin
being
on
the
jury.
now,
the
judges'
rebuttal
testimony
and
the
affidavit
of
vick,
we
think,
went
to
three
factual
issues
that
was
then
properly
before
the
jury.
one
was
the
question
of
whether
the
recording
itself
which
petitioner's
counsel
attacked
--
we
refer
to
the
various
times
in
petitioner's
own
examination
is
that
thing
on
vick's
bag
and
implying
to
the
jury
that
this
was
part
of
a
devious
course
of
conduct
by
the
government
to
have
worked,
the
petitioner
up
to
his
stay
where
he
would
be
making
a
statement
into
recording
device
that
that
recording
was
unauthorized,
unlawful
part
of
an
unlawful
scheme
by
the
government.
we
think
that
it
was
appropriate
to
put
on
the
judges
to
testify
that
the
government
had
come
to
them.
government
prosecutors
had
come
to
the
judges
in
their
dilemma
to
seek
authorization
for
that,
that
kind
of
investigative
step;
that
the
jury
would,
otherwise,
have
had
the
reason
to
believe
that
the
government
was
acting
improperly.
now
it's
true
that
in
passing,
in
reading
petitioner's
own
admissions
to
the
judges
in
the
disbarment
proceeding,
what
was
also
read
to
the
jury
was
the
fact
that
judge
gray
had
then
said
in
the
course
of
the
disbarment
proceeding,
that
he
had
authorized
the
recording.
but
that
did
not
put
before
the
jury
in
any
way
other
than
hearsay
the
fact
that
the
judges
had
authorized
him.
those
transcripts
were
introduced
simply
to
establish
petitioner's
own
admissions,
his
own
statements
in
the
disbarment
proceeding.
and
what
the
judges
said
at
that
time,
and
merely
the
transcript
was
being
read
to
the
jury.
what
the
judges
said
at
that
time
was
context
for
petitioner's
own
admissions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
petitioner
himself,
mr.
justice
fortas,
admitted
that
the
recording
was
accurate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
but
the
jury
had
the
function
of
passing,
mr.
justice
fortas
on
the
entrapment
claim
and
on
the
claim
that
was
all
a
devious
plot
by
the
government.
this
was
really
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
the
elements
of
entrapment
are
both
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
government's
conduct
whether
we,
we
think
properly
that
the
jury
was
able
to
consider
how
fair,
how
devious
the
government's
conduct
may
have
been
in
all
these
meetings
between
vick
and
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
well,
our
position
is
that,
the
government,
when
it
did
equip
vick
with
a
tape
recorder,
was
in
a
dilemma
as
to
what
an
appropriate
investigative
step
would
be
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
we
think
it
had
an
evidentiary
reason
for
--
really
for
almost
three
separate
reasons.
we
think
one,
it
had
an
evidentiary
reason
because
it
was
proper
for
the
jury
to
consider
whether
in
the
course
of
dealings
between
petitioner
and
vick,
the
government
had
engaged
in
unlawful
activity.
that
enters
as
well
into
a
jury
determination
of
entrapment
that
this
court
has
in
its
entrapment
cases
called
attention
of
the
fact
that
when
the
government
uses
improper
persuasion,
improper
techniques
in
its
dealings
with
the
suspect,
then
that
may
very
well
be
part
of
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
called
course
of
conduct
in
such
that
the
conviction
should
be
invalidated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
propriety
or
impropriety
is
established
to
the
extent
that
it
shows
that
the
government
was
not
intending
to
use
the
recording
unless
it
had
received
the
authorization
of
the
district
judges.
in
other
words,
not
merely
the
authorization
but
just
the
fact
that
the
government
was
not
going
out
on
its
own
to
use
any
kind
of
investigative
method
that
it
could
think
of.
in
addition,
though,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
think
there
are
other
reasons,
other
evidentiary
reasons
for
the
judges'
testimony.
one
of
the
very
critical
issues
of
fact
before
the
jury
was
or
i
can't
say
it's
critical
because
our
view
that
even
in
the
petitioner's
testimony,
there
was
no
entrapment
for
the
jury
could
have
found
out.
but
one
of
the
very
important
issues
was,
was
vick
suggesting
to
the
petitioner
before
november
7
that
he
would
speak
to
his
cousin?
vick's
testimony
was
that
between
october
28
and
november
7,
he
didn't
know
such
thing.
now,
the
fact
that
on
november
8,
the
government
came
before
the
judges
and
submitted
to
the
judges
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
an
affidavit
by
vick,
which
contain
nothing
more
than
a
relation
of
one
conversation,
a
conversation
of
a
day
or
before.
we
think
did
bear
on
the
issue
whether
there
had
been
a
whole
series
of
conversation
as
private.
if
petitioner
was
telling
the
truth
as
to
that
whole
series
of
dealings,
the
government
would
have
had
much
more
by
november
8
than
merely
one
conversation
by
vick
with
petitioner.
so
that
the
circumstances
of
the
affidavit,
and
let
me
say
the
affidavit
was
something
which
the
government
wanted
to
introduce
in
its
case
in
chief
but
to
which
the
petitioner
objected
at
that
time
because
vick
was
already
off
the
stand
and
the
judge
said,
“well,
you
can
only
introduce
it
if
you
put
vick
back
on
to
the
stand
to
identify
it.”
so,
if
the
affidavit
was
going
to
be
included
and
that,
we
think,
did
rebut
the
claim
that
there
had
been
a
series
of
discussions
prior
to
that,
but
if
the
affidavit
was
going
to
be
put
in
then
the
judge
had
to
be
put
on
to
identify
that
affidavit
and
to
say
yes
on
the
basis
of
that
affidavit
which
was
presented
to
mean
under
circumstances
under
which
it
was
presented
to
him.
he,
i
think,
did
some
official
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
that
was
a
factual
issue
before
the
jury.
there
was
a
critical
factual
issue
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
prosecutors
because
petitioner's
testimony,
of
course,
tried
to
bring
or
tried
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that
this
man
was
wiggling
and
persuading
him
over
a
whole
week
or
more
than
a
week
to
try
to
get
him
to
agree
to
bribe
the
juror.
so,
on
the
issue
of
dates,
on
the
issue
on
what
was
happening
between
october
28
and
november
7,
we
think
that
that
testimony
of
the
judges
was
both
proper
and
in
fact
necessary
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
no
written
order
but
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact
that
the
judges
did
in
fact
authorize.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
it
was
probably
just
based
on
the
judges'
view
that
they
could
preserve
the
integrity
of
their
own
bar
and
of
their
own
court.
it
was
--
the
judges
immediately,
when
they
first
called
petitioner
before
them,
view
this
as
a
disbarment
proceeding
as
an
inquiry
into
whether
an
officer
of
the
court
had
in
fact
been
attempting
to
corrupt
justice
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
and
i
think
the
judges
felt
this
was
part
of
their
function
in
the
orderly
preservation
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
district
of
course.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
remaining
major
contention
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
third
ground,
in
my
discussion
with
mr.
justice
fortas
i
think
sort
of
--
became
intertwine
with
the
second
and
that
is,
that
we
think
it's
perfectly
proper
in
any
entrapment
case
to
bring
before
the
jury
the
entire
course
of
the
government's
conduct.
in
other
words,
if
a
government
agency
is
accused
by
the
defendant
as
part
of
his
defense
of
entrapping
him,
then
we
think
the
jury
is
entitled
to
know
exactly
what
steps
the
government
has
taken
in
that
series
of
dealings
with
the
defendant.
and
what
the
government
did
before
vick
went
in
the
second
time
to
speak
to
petitioner
and
before
vick
went
in
the
third
time
to
speak
with
petitioner
is
we
think
an
appropriate
consideration
to
the
jury,
the
jury
ought
to
be
have
before
it
in
such
a
determination
the
entire
course
of
the
government's
conduct
from
beginning
to
end.
and
really,
petitioner's
claim
was
that
from
october
28
until
the
date
of
this
recording
on
november
11,
vick
was
engaged
in
a
continuous
entrapment
which
resulted
in
that
--
in
what
appeared
on
that
recording.
and
the
jury
could
barely
consider
on
determining
whether
he
was
exactly
why
he
went
in
on
november
8
and
we
think
the
judges
testimony
bore
on
why
he
went
in
there
to
speak
to
him
on
november
8
and
why
he
went
in
there
to
speak
to
petitioner
on
november
11.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
of
any,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course,
there
was.
i
really
don't
know
but
i
could
find
out
if
there
was.
i
haven't
really
addressed
my
attention
to
that.
if
you
like,
i
can
certainly
find
out
if
there
was
any
regulation
or
not.
i
don't
know
of
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
--
you
mean
whether
the
request
for
him
to
seek
tape
recording?
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
that
initiated
with
the
department.
but
the
department
of
justice,
nonetheless,
reluctant
to
do
it,
particularly
because
it
involved
an
officer
of
the
court
and
the
process
of
the
court
and
because
there
were
some,
of
course,
some
legal
issues
as
to
whether
it
would
be
permissible
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to
now.
but
the
department
of
justice
was
reluctant
to
do
without
approval
of
the
judges.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
think
that
would
just
have
been
hearsay.
in
other
words,
what
the
judges
testified
to
was
--
there
was
really
no
transcript
of
that
proceeding
before
the
judges.
the
judges
just
testified
to
what
had
happened,
i
guess
in
chambers,
when
the
government
prosecutors
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
a
government
prosecutor
who
came
before
the
judges,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
application
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
initiated
with
government
counsel,
yes,
with
the
prosecutor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
counsel,
i
guess
would
have
testified
to
what
the
government
had
done
there
in
chambers.
he
could
not
have
testified,
he
could
have
testified,
i
guess,
to
what
the
judge
said
to
him
but
not
to
the
judges
action
itself.
the
judge
himself,
the
judges
themselves
testified
that
they
did
have
this
question
before
them
and
that
they
did
approve
it.
i
request
what
is
in
the
judges'
mind.
the
reasons
that
they
approved
it
could
not
have
been
testified
to
by
government
counsels.
the
judges
in
effect
said
that
it
was
presented
to
them
and
because
--
they
recognized
that
it
was
an
investigative
dilemma,
they
approved,
they
authorized
the
recording.
that
--
the
fact
of
authorization
may
be
could
have
been
testified
to
by
government
counsel.
but
we
think
government
wasn't
required
to
be
limited
to
just
that
testimony
but
could
put
on
what
the
judges
themselves
thought
at
that
time
or
why
they
approved
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
authorization
itself
i
think
it
could
have
prove
it
against
him.
i
come
now
to
a
bundle
of
invasion
of
privacy
claim,
the
fourth
amendment
contentions.
but
before
discussing
them
in
detail,
i
think
it's
important
may
be
to
put
the
facts
in
some
practical
prospective.
the
record
establishes
that
on
december
of
1963,
vick
requested
a
meeting
with
walter
sheridan,
the
government
consultant,
and
reported
to
him
at
that
time
that
to
his
knowledge
petitioner
had
tried
to
bribe
at
least
one
juror
in
the
earlier
trial,
the
trial
back
in
1962.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
was
the
special
consultant
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
was
an
official
of
the
department
of
justice
who
was
a
special
consultant
to
the
--
i
used
the
word
“consultant”
just
to
shorten
his
title,
special
consultant
to
department
of
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh!
yes,
he
was
definitely.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
in
the
summer
of
july
or
august
of
1963
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
both
sheridan
and
vick
testified
it
was
some
place
late
july
and
early
or
early
august.
mr.
nathan
lewin
vick
went
to
sheridan.
he
called
sheridan
and
came
to
him
requesting
a
meeting
with
sheridan.
sheridan
was
then
in
nashville.
this
was
several
months
after
the
indictment
in
the
--
after
the
jury
bribery
indictment
which
gave
rise
to
the
case
which
immediately
followed
this
and
as
to
which
petitioner
was
representing
one
of
the
defendants.
vick
was
not
then
employed,
at
that
particular
moment
he
was
not
employed
by
petitioner.
but
vick
asked
for
meeting
with
sheridan.
it's
true
that
vick
--
prior
to
that,
just
to
clear
of
some
things
that
were
raised
in
petitioner's
argument,
it's
true
that
vick
have
had
prior
to
that,
spoken
with
the
fbi
and
had
been
told
that
at
the
time
he
was
employed
by
the
petitioner
that
the
fbi
was
not
speaking
to
him
because
he
was
employed
by
the
counsel
for
the
defendant.
mr.
nathan
lewin
vick's
first
conversation
with
sheridan
-
-
mr.
nathan
lewin
--was
about
an
attempt
that
petitioner
had
made
to
bribe
the
juror
in
the
1962
trial
when
he
was
representing
-
-
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
was
the
test
of
the
trial.
and
that
report
is
the
report
that
gave
rise
to
the
count
two
of
this
indictment
on
which
petitioner
was
acquitted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
a
weird
story.
that's
right.
now
at
that
time,
vick
reported
that
incident
and
was
told
by
sheridan
that
he
did
not,
sheridan
did
not
want
to
hear
from
him
any
information
about
anything
other
than
illegal
activity
which
was
specifically
told
to
reporter.
he
wanted
to
continue
providing
information,
report
information,
only
about
illegal
activity
and
nothing
about
anything
else.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
was
not
employed
but
it
was
known
that
he
had
previously
been
employed
by
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
known
--
well,
in
relation
to
the
forthcoming
trial
or
in
relation
to
anything
he'd
known
in
the
past
about
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
at
that
time
--
well,
there
was
reason,
of
course,
in
relation
to
mr.
osborn
as
well
because
there
was
reason
on
the
basis
of
vick's
report
that
osborn
had
attempted
to
bribe
the
juror
in
the
earlier
trial
to
believe
that
he
might
be
involved
in
similar
attempts
in
the
forthcoming
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
no
discussion
of
any
particular
renewal
of
relationship
and
there's
nothing
that
i
know
of
in
the
record
or
in
any
place
outside
the
record
to
suggest
that
--
well
in
the
record,
it
specifically
deny,
both
vick
and
sheridan
specifically
deny,
that
sheridan
had
in
any
way
requested
him
to
be
employed
by
petitioner
or
that
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
seek
employment
or
in
--
but,
it
was
known
that
vick
have
had
a
various
associations
with
petitioner
with
other
people
who
were
investigating
for
petitioner.
and
maybe,
we're
engaging
possibly
in
similar
kind
of
activity.
and
in
that
light,
sheridan
thought
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
ask.
but
if
there
was
any
other
evidence
of
unlawful
activity,
it
would
be
brought
to
his
attention.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
forthcoming
trial
was
the
trial
which
resulted
in
the
convictions
which
are
up
here
on
the
next
case.
we
are
going
to
follow
this
one.
in
other
words,
those
petitioners
had
been,
and
one
other,
those
petitioners
and
another
defendant
had
been
indicted
in
may
of
1963
on
those
charges
and
the
trial
was
pending
at
that
time.
now,
in
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
he
was
working
out
in
the
open,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
was
--
at
least
to
the
extent
that
he
was
investigating
jurors.
he
was
going
to
people
who
i
guess
who
knew
them
or
would
know
them
and
asking
about
them.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
generally
known
to
the
police
department.
i
don't
think
and
it
was
certainly
not
generally
known
to
the
federal
government.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
possibly
to
those
whom
he
was
asking.
i
don't
think
he
was
disguising
his
identity
when
he
was
asking
anybody
what
they
knew
about
prospective
jurors.
he
didn't
report
it
to
either
his
superior
or
to
the
federal
government
but
he
nor
right,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
on
the
record
or
anything
that
i
know
which
indicate
that
he
was
in
anyway
disguising
his
identity
when
he
was
making
this
investigation.
it
was
something
that
he
was
--
i
guess
he
might
say
it
was
sort
of
in
between.
it
wasn't
really
an
undercover
work
but
it
wasn't
a
sort
of
thing
he
was
reporting
regularly
to
his
superior.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
at
the
time
of
the
test
pretrial
of
this
investigating
jury.
no,
we
found
out
about
that
afterwards.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes!
the
government
found
out
after
the
test
pretrial
that
he
had
been
conducting
such
investigations
and
petitioner
had
retained
him
from
that,
yes.
now,
the
record
here
contains
the
testimony,
record
on
this
case
on
page
32-b
which
is
the
last
two
pages
of
the
record
contains
the
testimony
of
the
government
prosecutor
that
vick's
allegation
as
to
petitioner's
attempt
to
bribe
the
juror
in
the
1962
trial
was
considered
by
him
too
incredible
that
even
warrant,
he
is
authorizing
any
further
investigation
of
that
attempt.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
and
on
page
32-b,
the
prosecutor
testified
that
he
--
that
he
said
when
that
matter
was
brought
to
my
attention
i
said:
“there's
nothing
to
that.
don't
go
into
that
because
the
petitioner's
reputation
as
a
member
of
the
tennessee
bar”.
so
that
we
had,
as
of
the
summer
of
1963,
a
report
by
vick
is
to
an
attempt
to
bribe
the
jury
in
the
earlier
case
which
the
government
at
that
point
believes
too
incredible
to
even
warrant
investigation.
then,
vick
returns,
calls
and
said
that
he
has
been
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
on
--
in
october
there
was
a
report
in
the
record,
and
this
was
a
report
that
mr.
kossman
was
referring
to
in
october
in
which
vick
told
someone.
it's
not
clear
that
he
told
this
to
sheridan.
it
appears
more
likely
that
he
told
to
the
fbi
agents;
that
he'd
seen
the
jury
list
and
on
the
jury
list
was
his
cousin,
elliot
and
somebody
else
was
in
there.
and
just
that
report
that
those
are
the
people
on
the
jury.
now,
both
vick
and
sheridan
unequivocally
denied
that
they
have
ever
discussed
or
that
sheridan
did
ever
suggested
to
vick
or
that
vick
ever
suggested
to
sheridan
before
november
7
that
he
would
mention
to
petitioner
that
his
cousin
was
on
the
jury.
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
vick
did
make
the
statement
on
november
7,
and
in
no
way
suggested
or
requested
by
the
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
this
was
october
21st.
october
21st,
this
was
a
week
before
he
was
mr.
osborn's
employee.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
that
was
unequivocally
denied
that,
that
both
sheridan
and
vick
that
there
was
any
suggestion
at
that
time
that
he
get
in
mr.
osborn's
employee
or
that
he
attempts
to
in
anyway
even
to
speak
with
osborn.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
report
had
nothing
to
do
with
osborn
at
all.
that
report
simply
states
that
in
looking
over
the
jury
list,
vick
said
that
he
was
a
cousin
of
eliot
and
that
he
knew
another
one
of
the
jurors,
prospective
jurors
on
the
list.
that's
the
report
of
october
21st.
and
vick's
testimony
of
the
trial,
mr.
kossman
said
that
he
kept
denying
that
he
discussed
his
relationship
with
his
cousin
with
anybody
in
the
government.
well,
the
denial
of
vick's
were
that
the
questions
which
asked
him
whether
he
had
discussed
with
anyone
in
the
government
the
possibility
which
was
mentioned
to
osborn,
to
the
petitioner,
his
relationship
with
his
cousin.
not
that
he
had
denied
mentioning
to
the
government
his
relationship
with
his
cousin.
we
fully
agree
and
vick
never
denied
it
that
he
did
tell
the
government
on
october
21st
that
he
was
related
to
elliott;
that
elliot
was
a
cousin.
and
that's
all,
that's
what
he
ultimately
said
to
osborn.
of
course,
if
this
relates
somewhat
to
the
entrapment
claim
that
that
was
entrapment,
vis-à-vis
the
petitioner,
it
should
have
been
entrapped
vis-à-vis
the
government
and
i
suggest
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
week
later,
he
was
employed
by
osborn.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
circumstances
of
that
are
that
vick
agreed
the
trial
without
dispute
that
he
sought
employment
for
osborn
because
he
was
financially
--
in
financial
strife
and
he
wanted
to
have
added
income.
and
that's
what
he
testified
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
evidence
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
no
evidence
on
the
record
whatever.
and
after
he
received
employment
from
vick,
he
did
report
to
the
government
that
he
had
from
petitioner
rather,
vick
did
report
to
the
government
had
been
employed
by
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
immediately
on
the
same
day.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
now
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
not,
did
not
really
go,
we
think,
to
any
attempt
by
the
government
to
find
out
whether
petitioner
was
trying
to
bribe
juror.
so,
that
he
can't
deny
that.
the
government
may,
you
know,
to
the
extent
that
osborn,
so
that
vick
may
have
learned
such
things
sheridan
could've
request
him
to
report
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
reported
that
to
sheridan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
recall
any
testimony
to
that
regard
but
we
don't
dispute
that
the
instruction
back
in
the
summer
continued.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
that
was
relevant,
if
i
may
just
make
a
point,
that
was
relevant
because
it's
entirely
clear
from
petitioner's
own
testimony
that
he
knew,
and
vick
had
told
him
that
vick
on
his
meeting
with
sheridan
back
in
the
summer,
had
promised
sheridan
that
he
would
not,
no
longer
accept
employment
from
petitioner.
on
page
458
of
the
record
at
the
very
top,
petitioner
testifies
that
he
had
told
me
that
he
promised
walter
sheridan
that
if
mr.
sheridan
would
let
him
alone,
he
would
never
work
for
me
again.
he
had
reported
that
to
me.
in
other
words,
vick
had
spoken
to
sheridan
in
summer
and
said,
“now,
i'm
telling
you
this
report
about
what
happened
in
the
past.
i
won't
be
employed
by
osborn
anymore.”
now,
in
october
28,
he
again
accepts
employment
from
osborn
and
he
then
calls
sheridan.
now
that
could
just
as
well
been
attributable
to
the
fact
that
he
promised
sheridan
that
he
wouldn't
accept
employment
from
osborn
and
yet
turned
around
to
vick
as
any
attempt
to
convey
information
to
the
government
and
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
any
illegal
activity,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
nothing
was
illegal
about
him
finally.
it
was
merely
in
agreement
--
well,
but
it
was
a
violation
of
his
agreement
as
it
were
not
to
be
employed
by
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
he
reported
that
because
he
had
told
sheridan
that
he
wouldn't
do
this
and
like
he
may
very
well
felt
that
now
here,
he
was
in
effect
violating
what
he
had
promised
sheridan,
he
ought
to
it,
he's
dealing
fairly
with
sheridan
now,
report
to
him
that
because
of
his
financial
circumstances
or
whatever
reason,
he
felt
that
necessary
again
to
take
employment
from
the
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
on
page
458.
now,
that's
petitioner
testimony
that
he
knew,
that
petitioner
knew
that
vick
had
spoken
with
sheridan
and
he
promised
sheridan
not
to
be
in
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
have
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
that
was,
well,
what
vick
was
then
suggesting
to
the
fbi
was
that
he
would
be
reporting
i
guess
all
sorts
of
things.
and
the
fbi
felt
that
at
that
point,
first
of
all,
at
that
point,
there
was
never
any
suggestion
that
petitioner
had
ever
tried
to
bribe
the
juror.
so,
certainly,
the
interest
of
law
enforcement
in
having
vick
speak
to
petitioner
and
then
report
to
the
fbi
which
was
very
farfetched
because
the
only
interest
presumably,
the
only
thing
that
would
have
been
gained
from
to
that
point
would
have
been
defense
threat.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
government
has
always
tried
to,
not
to
do
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
following
this.
in
other
words,
the
fbi
felt
that
at
that
point,
any
communications
between
vick
and
federal
agents
could
serve
no
lawful
purpose,
or
very,
very
slight
purpose
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think
he
did.
he
still
was
interested
only
in
unlawful
activity
and
that
was,
we
think,
a
request
that
the
fbi
could
have
made
and
that's
what
we
think
is
something
--
that's
in
effect
the
man
that's
made
of
every
citizen
to
report
unlawful
activity.
but
at
that
time
vick
came
to
the
fbi
and
asked
or
proposed
a
certain
arrangement
with
them,
the
chances
of
receiving
information
of
unlawful
activity
and
the
dangers
of
receiving
things
which
were
not
information
of
unlawful
activity,
when
balanced,
were
so
substantially
against
receiving
information
from
vick
that
the
government
or
the
fbi
at
that
point
said,
“well,
we
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.”
now,
since
that
time,
of
course,
vick
had
reported
an
attempt
to
bribe
the
juror
in
that
earlier
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
it's
the
essence.
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
was,
he
could
in
fact
instruct
the
fbi
what
to
do,
right?
now,
vick
then
comes
to
the
government
on
november
7
and
calls
up
sheridan
and
says
now
petitioner
has
attempted,
osborn
has
--
when
i
mentioned
that
my
cousin
was
on
the
jury,
osborn
suggested
that
i
offer
a
bribe
to
him.
and
the
question,
what
was
the
government
to
do
in
these
circumstances?
if
petitioner
plan
to
meet
vick
and
discuss
these
things
in
the
future,
the
furtherance
of
this
endeavor,
there
was,
it
was
clear
that
the
meetings
would
be
between
the
two
of
them
alone.
there
would
no
way
to
determine
whether
vick's
story
was
truthful
other
than
to
permit
him
to
corroborate
it
by
carrying
voluntarily
a
recording
device
which
would
record
one
conversation
and
one
conversation
only
between
himself
and
the
other
party
to
that
conversation.
since
the
problem
concerned,
the
integrity
of
justice
in
that
court,
it
was
appropriate
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
district
judges
and
to
meet
standards
which
those
members
of
this
court
who
have
expressed
the
view
that
and
to
seeking
justification
before
a
magistrate
to
be
obtained
before
such
a
recording
be
made
by
a
government
agent.
the
prosecutors
in
this
case
went
to
the
judges
and
sought
authorization.
now,
we
think
that
that
course,
having
sought
authorization
from
the
judges,
having
attempted
to
get
corroborative
information
from
only
one
conversation,
we
think
the
practical
necessities
in
this
case
are
quite
as
compelling
as
the
fact
of
necessity
to
which
the
chief
justice
adverted
to
in
the
lopez
case.
here,
we
have
a
police
officer,
his
credibility
is
put
in
question
who
will
be
challenged
as
to
his
conversations
with
a
lawyer
of
longstanding
simply
on
a
one
to
one
basis.
the
jury
would
just
simply
be
presented
by
a
conflicting
testimony
which
it
could
not
resolve
to
accept
in
favor
of
the
man
who
had
a
better
reputation.
and
indeed,
petitioner's
own
reputation
was
at
stake.
was
the
government
merely
on
vick's
word
to
indict
petitioner
and
put
him
to
trial
in
order
to
present
that
issue
to
the
jury?
we
submit
that
the
only
realistic,
practical
course
was
to
take
this
very
limited
step
of
providing
corroborative
information
in
these
circumstances.
now,
if
i
might
just
very,
very
briefly
refer
to
some
of
the
contentions
or
major
contentions
made
by
the
amicus
in
this
case
and
which
also
lapse
over
into
the
claims
made
in
the
succeeding
cases.
the
fourth
amendment
certainly
wasn't
violated
by
vick's
being
there
in
petitioner's
office
and
speaking
with
him.
indeed,
when
petitioner
and
vick
wanted
the
greatest
amount
of
secrecy
or
the
greatest
amount
of
confidentiality,
between
themselves,
the
record
while
conclusively
demonstrates
this,
they
went
out
unto
the
street,
into
the
alley,
next
to
their
office
to
speak
with
each
other.
they
were
not
relying
in
any
way.
in
other
words,
our
proposition
is
short
with
regards
to
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
is
that,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
violated
when
a
government
informant
repeat
statements
made
to
him
by
defendant
even
if
those
statements
are
made
in
the
fourth
amendment
enclosure.
that's
because
the
disclosure
of
the
statement,
that
would
someone
makes
to
me,
there
is
no
relation
to
where
it
is
we
happen
to
be
standing.
if
my
best
friend
tells
me
something
in
the
privacy
of
his
home,
he
relied
on
that
privacy
to
keep
out
of
eavesdroppers,
to
keep
out
eavesdroppers
but
not
to
keep
me
up.
and
he
only
relies
on
my
trustworthiness
not
to
repeat
what
i,
he
said
to
me.
my
reputation
doesn't
in
anyway
violate
the
privacy
at
home.
the--
if
i
might
just
have
one
minute
to
respond
to
the
claim
that
the,
that
the
judicial
authorization
was
improper
which
petitioner
makes
a
substantial
to
do
in
his
petitioner,
we
think
it's
a
rather
remarkable
claim
since
it's
quite
clear
that
the
government
was
taking
them
more
precautionary
course
which
attempting
to
protect
the
petitioner's
right
when
it
went
to
the
judges
in
the
first
instance
and
sought
authorization
rather
than
taking
this
step
entirely
on
its
own.
and
the
circumstances
under
which
the
recording
were
made,
both
in
terms
of
the
limitation
as
to
time
and
as
to
place
and
as
to
conversation
and
as
to
prior
authorization,
we
think,
warrant
certainly
not
justified
condemnation
of
the
government's
conduct
under
this
court's
decision
in
lopez
or
in
of
the
--
