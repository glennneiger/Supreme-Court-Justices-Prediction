mr.
theodore
s.
perry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
issue
in
first
national
bank
versus
walker
bank
is
whether
or
not
congress
intended
that
a
state
could
impose
restrictions
on
a
national
bank
branching
in
its
own
community
by
which
restrictions
would
permit
all
other
state
banks
to
branch
in
that
community.
we'd
like
first
to
discuss
briefly
a
theory
of
competitive
equality
as
it
applies
to
the
first
national
bank.
it
disturbs
the
first
national
bank
because
all
we
are
trying
to
do
is
compete
equally
with
walker
bank.
automobile
banking
has
come
to
logan.
the
two
largest
banks
in
the
state
of
utah
have
branches
in
logan,
utah.
each
of
the
branches
have
a
drive-in
office
located
about
a
half
a
block
away
for
automobile
customers
to
drive-in
and
make
deposits.
the
customers
of
the
first
national
bank
also
want
this
convenience.
we
looked
at
the
branch
banking
statute
and
noted
in
subdivision
f
that
any
additional
office
for
receiving
deposits
or
paying
checks
is
a
branch
and
so
we
felt
the
only
proper
course
would
be
to
apply
for
a
branch.
we
looked
at
the
branch
banking
law,
it
said
two
conditions
are
required.
one,
state
law
must
expressly
authorize
branch
banking
in
that
community
at
that
time.
two,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
must
approve.
informally
in
1962,
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
state
bank
commissioner
and
asked
him,
are
state
banks
expressly
authorized
to
branch
in
a
city,
the
second
class
as
the
logan.
his
answer
was
yes.
in
fact
he
said,
he
had
just
authorized
provo
state
bank
to
branch
in
the
city
of
provo.
it
was
the
only
unit
bank
in
provo
and
it
had
established
a
branch
up
in
the
byu
campus.
we
next
went
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
he
approved
our
branch.
now,
we
opened
and
six
months
passed
and
nobody
made
any
objection
to
our
branch
and
i
suppose
that
the
provo
state
bank
case
has
never
arisen,
this
case
would
not
be
before
this
court
at
this
time.
suppose
ten
years
had
passed
and
walker
bank
versus
taylor
came
up,
would
the
directors
of
the
first
national
bank
be
required
to
close
their
branch?
i
presume
if
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
law,
we
would.
but
suppose
the
state
supreme
court
later
reverses
itself
then
what's
the
responsibility
of
the
directors
of
the
stockholders?
our
picture
of
another
fact
situation,
suppose
this
1956.
at
that
time,
in
logan,
the
cache
valley
banking
company
was
in
existence.
now,
suppose
the
first
national
bank
wanted
to
branch
by
taking
over
the
cache
valley
banking
company.
i
assume
under
the
doctrine
of
the
united
states
versus
philadelphia
national
bank,
the
department
of
justice
would
say
no
because
that
would
remove
competition
in
logan
and
yet
we
have
to
do
that
as
state
law
applies
and
so
we're
faced
with
an
impossible
situation
in
utah.
if
state
law
governs,
then
we
can't
comply
with
federal
law.
if
we
comply
with
federal
law,
then
we
violate
state
law.
and
so
the
effect
is,
that
if
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
national
banks
cannot
branch
within
the
limits
of
their
own
hometown
which
is
the
intent
of
the
mcfadden
act
to
permit
them
to
branch
there
if
states
bank
could
branch
in
that
city.
now,
we
think
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
all
state
restrictions
should
apply.
when
congress
passed
the
mcfadden
act,
they
said
number
one,
you
are
subject
to
population
restrictions.
in
other
words,
in
cities
of
less
than
25,000,
a
national
bank
cannot
have
a
branch.
this
provision
is
later
removed
but
it
shows
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time
that
it
was
established
in
the
restrictions
for
the
national
banks.
it
wasn't
looking
to
state
law
for
restrictions.
congress
also
said
if
a
national
bank
establishes
one
branch
it
has
to
have
the
same
capital
requirements
as
if
there
were
two
national
banks.
now,
we
look
in
section
51
and
it
says
you
have
to
have
$240,000.00
in
capital
to
establish
two
national
banks.
so
you'd
have
to
have
the
same
amount
to
establish
one
branch.
if
you
turn
to
utah
law,
if
you
have
a
capital
of
$60,000.00
you
can
establish
a
branch.
if
you
go
to
north
carolina,
in
the
city
the
size
of
oregon,
you
have
to
have
$300,000.00.
now,
how
can
you
say
that
the
restrictions
are
identical
if
the
capital
requirements
are
expressly
made
different
in
federal
law.
and
we
turn
to
subdivision
law
of
the
statute
leading
to
with
outside
branches
and
congress
specifically
makes
two
restrictions
of
state
law
applicable
to
outside
branches,
branches
outside
the
community.
they
say,
first,
they're
subject
to
location
requirements
of
state
law.
they
say
secondly,
they
are
subject
to
capital
restrictions
of
state
law,
that
these
restrictions
are
not
imposed
on
branches
organized
in
the
hometown
of
the
national
bank.
so
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
all
state
restrictions
to
be
applicable.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
all
what
we're
saying
is
that
you
should
not
read
into
it
in
addition
because
walker
bank,
a
state
bank,
has
already
branched
in
logan
under
state
law,
so
there
is
expressed
authority
to
branch
in
logan.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
that
is
correct
but
it
still
has
it
expressed
authority
to
branch
there.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
that
is
correct.
if
we
were
in
provo,
under
the
provo
state
bank
situation,
walker
bank
versus
taylor,
state
supreme
court
cases
cannot
branch
even
though
there's
no
other
unit
bank
in
logan
we
can
take
over.
now,
this
theory
of
competitive
equalities,
it
is
cited
by
the
respondents
and
based
on
about
five
subsections
of
the
national
banking
act.
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
each
one
of
these
subsections
would
reveal
that
there
is
no
theory
of
competitive
equality.
first
they
cite
section
51.
i've
already
referred
to
section
51
and
it
expressly
states
that
the
capital
requirements
for
federal
banks
are
different
than
state
banks.
it
establishes
the
capital
requirements
for
federal
banks.
only
in
certain
isolated
instances
is
there
any
similarity
between
state
and
federal
capitalization
requirements.
next
they
point
to
section
92
(a).
it
says
--
or
they
claim
it
says
that
a
national
bank
can
act
as
a
trustee
or
an
executor
unless
the
state
bank
can
also
act.
but
this
court
held
back
in
1924
in
the
case
of
missouri
versus
duncan
that
under
certain
situations,
a
national
bank
could
act
as
a
trustee
even
though
state
law
expressly
forbid
a
state
bank
from
acting
as
trustee.
they
also
point
to
section
85
on
interest
that
this
court
held
a
long
time
ago
in
tiffany
versus
national
bank
of
missouri
that
under
certain
situations,
the
interest
rates
can
be
different
for
national
banks
and
state
banks
and
i
am
sure
anyone
who
has
read
the
newspapers
recently
knows
that
the
interest
rates
are
established
for
federal
law
for
banks
and
not
by
state
law
because
it's
the
federal
government
who
is
imposing
the
interest
rate
we
pay
on
deposits
and
not
state
governments.
so
i
think
there
is
no
theory
of
competitive
equality
in
the
national
banking
act.
congress
originally
set
up
the
national
banking
act
for
a
system
of
national
banks
and
this
court
has
affirmed
again
and
again
that
under
certain
instances,
the
national
bank
has
privileges
that
a
state
bank
doesn't
have.
and
certainly
an
examination
of
state
law
we'll
show
they
have
a
great
many
privileges
that
national
banks
do
not
have.
some
of
their
--
ones
that
bothers
most
in
utah
is
the
limitation
the
amount
we
could
loan
to
any
one
customer.
under
federal
law,
we're
restricted
to
10%.
this
means
our
large
customers
have
to
go
elsewhere
to
make
a
loan.
but
under
state
law
they
can
go
up
to
15%.
in
real
estate
loans,
there
are
hardly
any
limitation
on
what
a
state
bank
can
do
and
we're
very
severely
restricted
by
national
banking
laws.
there
is
no
competitive
equality
the
national
banking
act
and
i
think
the
court
should
remember
that
what
we're
concerned
about
here
is
a
national
bank
which
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government.
this
court
has
said,
state
laws
cannot
limit
the
efficiency
of
a
federal
instrumentality
in
national
banks.
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
tenth
--
court
of
--
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
to
limit
our
efficiency
in
receiving
deposits
because
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
all
they
want
to
do
is
compete
with
walker
bank.
we
want
to
have
our
small
business
customers,
our
farmers,
our
laborers
who
don't
want
to
get
dressed
up
when
they
do
their
banking,
come
and
have
a
place
where
they
can
make
deposits.
that's
all
we're
seeking.
we
don't
want
to
put
walker
bank
out
of
business
is
apparently
they're
attempting
to
do
to
us
when
we
all
we
want
to
do
is
compete
equally
with
them.
and
we
think
the
court
examines
the
law
carefully
that
they
will
find
that
we
have
that
right
of
equal
competition
with
them.
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
issue
in
first
national
bank
versus
walker
bank
is
whether
or
not
congress
intended
that
a
state
could
impose
restrictions
on
a
national
bank
branching
in
its
own
community
by
which
restrictions
would
permit
all
other
state
banks
to
branch
in
that
community.
we'd
like
first
to
discuss
briefly
a
theory
of
competitive
equality
as
it
applies
to
the
first
national
bank.
it
disturbs
the
first
national
bank
because
all
we
are
trying
to
do
is
compete
equally
with
walker
bank.
automobile
banking
has
come
to
logan.
the
two
largest
banks
in
the
state
of
utah
have
branches
in
logan,
utah.
each
of
the
branches
have
a
drive-in
office
located
about
a
half
a
block
away
for
automobile
customers
to
drive-in
and
make
deposits.
the
customers
of
the
first
national
bank
also
want
this
convenience.
we
looked
at
the
branch
banking
statute
and
noted
in
subdivision
f
that
any
additional
office
for
receiving
deposits
or
paying
checks
is
a
branch
and
so
we
felt
the
only
proper
course
would
be
to
apply
for
a
branch.
we
looked
at
the
branch
banking
law,
it
said
two
conditions
are
required.
one,
state
law
must
expressly
authorize
branch
banking
in
that
community
at
that
time.
two,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
must
approve.
informally
in
1962,
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
state
bank
commissioner
and
asked
him,
are
state
banks
expressly
authorized
to
branch
in
a
city,
the
second
class
as
the
logan.
his
answer
was
yes.
in
fact
he
said,
he
had
just
authorized
provo
state
bank
to
branch
in
the
city
of
provo.
it
was
the
only
unit
bank
in
provo
and
it
had
established
a
branch
up
in
the
byu
campus.
we
next
went
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
he
approved
our
branch.
now,
we
opened
and
six
months
passed
and
nobody
made
any
objection
to
our
branch
and
i
suppose
that
the
provo
state
bank
case
has
never
arisen,
this
case
would
not
be
before
this
court
at
this
time.
suppose
ten
years
had
passed
and
walker
bank
versus
taylor
came
up,
would
the
directors
of
the
first
national
bank
be
required
to
close
their
branch?
i
presume
if
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
law,
we
would.
but
suppose
the
state
supreme
court
later
reverses
itself
then
what's
the
responsibility
of
the
directors
of
the
stockholders?
our
picture
of
another
fact
situation,
suppose
this
1956.
at
that
time,
in
logan,
the
cache
valley
banking
company
was
in
existence.
now,
suppose
the
first
national
bank
wanted
to
branch
by
taking
over
the
cache
valley
banking
company.
i
assume
under
the
doctrine
of
the
united
states
versus
philadelphia
national
bank,
the
department
of
justice
would
say
no
because
that
would
remove
competition
in
logan
and
yet
we
have
to
do
that
as
state
law
applies
and
so
we're
faced
with
an
impossible
situation
in
utah.
if
state
law
governs,
then
we
can't
comply
with
federal
law.
if
we
comply
with
federal
law,
then
we
violate
state
law.
and
so
the
effect
is,
that
if
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
national
banks
cannot
branch
within
the
limits
of
their
own
hometown
which
is
the
intent
of
the
mcfadden
act
to
permit
them
to
branch
there
if
states
bank
could
branch
in
that
city.
now,
we
think
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
all
state
restrictions
should
apply.
when
congress
passed
the
mcfadden
act,
they
said
number
one,
you
are
subject
to
population
restrictions.
in
other
words,
in
cities
of
less
than
25,000,
a
national
bank
cannot
have
a
branch.
this
provision
is
later
removed
but
it
shows
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time
that
it
was
established
in
the
restrictions
for
the
national
banks.
it
wasn't
looking
to
state
law
for
restrictions.
congress
also
said
if
a
national
bank
establishes
one
branch
it
has
to
have
the
same
capital
requirements
as
if
there
were
two
national
banks.
now,
we
look
in
section
51
and
it
says
you
have
to
have
$240,000.00
in
capital
to
establish
two
national
banks.
so
you'd
have
to
have
the
same
amount
to
establish
one
branch.
if
you
turn
to
utah
law,
if
you
have
a
capital
of
$60,000.00
you
can
establish
a
branch.
if
you
go
to
north
carolina,
in
the
city
the
size
of
oregon,
you
have
to
have
$300,000.00.
now,
how
can
you
say
that
the
restrictions
are
identical
if
the
capital
requirements
are
expressly
made
different
in
federal
law.
and
we
turn
to
subdivision
law
of
the
statute
leading
to
with
outside
branches
and
congress
specifically
makes
two
restrictions
of
state
law
applicable
to
outside
branches,
branches
outside
the
community.
they
say,
first,
they're
subject
to
location
requirements
of
state
law.
they
say
secondly,
they
are
subject
to
capital
restrictions
of
state
law,
that
these
restrictions
are
not
imposed
on
branches
organized
in
the
hometown
of
the
national
bank.
so
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
all
state
restrictions
to
be
applicable.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
all
what
we're
saying
is
that
you
should
not
read
into
it
in
addition
because
walker
bank,
a
state
bank,
has
already
branched
in
logan
under
state
law,
so
there
is
expressed
authority
to
branch
in
logan.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
that
is
correct
but
it
still
has
it
expressed
authority
to
branch
there.
mr.
theodore
s.
perry
that
is
correct.
if
we
were
in
provo,
under
the
provo
state
bank
situation,
walker
bank
versus
taylor,
state
supreme
court
cases
cannot
branch
even
though
there's
no
other
unit
bank
in
logan
we
can
take
over.
now,
this
theory
of
competitive
equalities,
it
is
cited
by
the
respondents
and
based
on
about
five
subsections
of
the
national
banking
act.
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
each
one
of
these
subsections
would
reveal
that
there
is
no
theory
of
competitive
equality.
first
they
cite
section
51.
i've
already
referred
to
section
51
and
it
expressly
states
that
the
capital
requirements
for
federal
banks
are
different
than
state
banks.
it
establishes
the
capital
requirements
for
federal
banks.
only
in
certain
isolated
instances
is
there
any
similarity
between
state
and
federal
capitalization
requirements.
next
they
point
to
section
92
(a).
it
says
--
or
they
claim
it
says
that
a
national
bank
can
act
as
a
trustee
or
an
executor
unless
the
state
bank
can
also
act.
but
this
court
held
back
in
1924
in
the
case
of
missouri
versus
duncan
that
under
certain
situations,
a
national
bank
could
act
as
a
trustee
even
though
state
law
expressly
forbid
a
state
bank
from
acting
as
trustee.
they
also
point
to
section
85
on
interest
that
this
court
held
a
long
time
ago
in
tiffany
versus
national
bank
of
missouri
that
under
certain
situations,
the
interest
rates
can
be
different
for
national
banks
and
state
banks
and
i
am
sure
anyone
who
has
read
the
newspapers
recently
knows
that
the
interest
rates
are
established
for
federal
law
for
banks
and
not
by
state
law
because
it's
the
federal
government
who
is
imposing
the
interest
rate
we
pay
on
deposits
and
not
state
governments.
so
i
think
there
is
no
theory
of
competitive
equality
in
the
national
banking
act.
congress
originally
set
up
the
national
banking
act
for
a
system
of
national
banks
and
this
court
has
affirmed
again
and
again
that
under
certain
instances,
the
national
bank
has
privileges
that
a
state
bank
doesn't
have.
and
certainly
an
examination
of
state
law
we'll
show
they
have
a
great
many
privileges
that
national
banks
do
not
have.
some
of
their
--
ones
that
bothers
most
in
utah
is
the
limitation
the
amount
we
could
loan
to
any
one
customer.
under
federal
law,
we're
restricted
to
10%.
this
means
our
large
customers
have
to
go
elsewhere
to
make
a
loan.
but
under
state
law
they
can
go
up
to
15%.
in
real
estate
loans,
there
are
hardly
any
limitation
on
what
a
state
bank
can
do
and
we're
very
severely
restricted
by
national
banking
laws.
there
is
no
competitive
equality
the
national
banking
act
and
i
think
the
court
should
remember
that
what
we're
concerned
about
here
is
a
national
bank
which
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government.
this
court
has
said,
state
laws
cannot
limit
the
efficiency
of
a
federal
instrumentality
in
national
banks.
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
tenth
--
court
of
--
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
to
limit
our
efficiency
in
receiving
deposits
because
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
all
they
want
to
do
is
compete
with
walker
bank.
we
want
to
have
our
small
business
customers,
our
farmers,
our
laborers
who
don't
want
to
get
dressed
up
when
they
do
their
banking,
come
and
have
a
place
where
they
can
make
deposits.
that's
all
we're
seeking.
we
don't
want
to
put
walker
bank
out
of
business
is
apparently
they're
attempting
to
do
to
us
when
we
all
we
want
to
do
is
compete
equally
with
them.
and
we
think
the
court
examines
the
law
carefully
that
they
will
find
that
we
have
that
right
of
equal
competition
with
them.
thank
you.
