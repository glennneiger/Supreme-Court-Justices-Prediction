mr.
joseph
s.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
the
action
was
filed
against
the
first
national
bank
of
logan
but
before
it
was
tried,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah
decided
the
case
which
is
exactly
in
point
with
this
case
except
the
bank
involved
was
the
provo
state
bank.
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah
rendered
its
decision
in
which
it
said
that
the
state
bank
of
provo
could
not
branch
in
the
city
of
provo.
the
law
of
the
state
of
utah
is
reflected
in
the
decision
in
the
case
of
walker
bank
versus
taylor.
and
that
case
says
that
where
the
statute
does
not
authorize
the
establishment
of
the
branch
it
prohibits
the
establishment
of
the
branch.
and
in
that
connection
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
another
section
of
the
utah
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
which
is
section
736.3
utah
code
annotated
1953
which
says
from
and
after
the
effective
date
of
this
act
which
was
1933,
1953,
“no
unit
bank
and
no
branch
bank
shall
be
established
or
authorized
to
conduct
a
banking
business
except
as
herein
before
in
section
736
expressly
provided.
now
we
go
back
to
section
36
(c)
of
the
national
banking
act.

joseph

mr.
joseph
s.
jones
the
national
banking
association
may
with
the
approval
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
established
and
operate
new
branches
one
within
the
limits
of
a
city,
town
or
village
in
which
said
association
is
situated.
if
such
establishment
and
i
am
emphasizing
the
word
such.
if
such
establishment
in
operation
are
at
the
time
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question,
the
law
of
the
state
in
question
is
announced
in
the
decision
in
the
case
of
walker
bank
versus
taylor
which
prohibited
the
state
bank
of
provo
in
the
city
of
the
second
class
and
under
the
same
circumstances
as
here
from
branching
and
i
simply
say
that
if
we
apply
the
language
of
76
--
36
(c)
to
our
situation
in
utah
that
the
establishment
of
the
branch
by
the
first
national
bank
of
logan
is
not
such
an
establishment
as
at
the
time
as
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question.
now,
my
colleague
mr.
bell
has
gone
through
the
history
of
this
statute.
i
think
the
issue
has
been
presented
to
the
court
and
i
don't
wish
to
be
repetitious.
if
the
court
would
like
to
ask
me
any
questions
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
them.
