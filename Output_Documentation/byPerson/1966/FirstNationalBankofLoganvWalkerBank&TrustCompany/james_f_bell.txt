mr.
james
f.
bell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
commercial
security
bank
in
cases
73
and
88.
this
is
the
so-called
ogden
case
arising
from
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jones,
my
colleague,
is
the
counsel
for
the
walker
bank
and
trust
company
in
51
which
arises
in
the
tenth
circuit
of
branches
in
logan.
the
issues
in
both
cases
are
identical
and
it
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
the
principal
statute
is
section
36
(c)
(1)
of
the
national
bank
act
which
permits
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
approve
an
application
of
a
national
bank
for
an
in-town
branch
if
the
establishment
of
such
a
branch
and
i
now
read
from
the
statutory
language
which
we
believe
is
significant,
“is
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question.”
now,
the
state
in
question
here
is
utah
and
the
applicable
provision
of
the
utah
code
reads
are
follows,
“no
branch
bank
shall
be
established
in
any
city
or
town
in
which
is
located
a
bank
or
banks,
state
or
national,
unless
the
bank
seeking
to
establish
such
branch
shall
take
over
an
existing
bank.”
now,
we
read
the
utah
statute
as
containing
two
clear
cut
provisions.
first
of
all,
it
contains
a
flat
prohibition
against
any
de
novo
branches.
secondly,
it
contains
permission
to
operate
an
acquired
bank
as
a
branch
following
an
acquisition.
the
first
of
these
provisions
is
the
one
applicable
in
this
case.
the
first
security
national
bank
has
applied
to
establish
a
de
novo
branch
in
the
city
of
ogden
which
is
a
city
with
four
existing
banks.
and
we
contend
that
a
de
novo
branch
of
a
national
bank
is
not
expressly
authorized
by
a
state
statute
which
prohibits
de
novo
branching
in
any
city
with
operating
banks.
this
is
basically
the
decision
of
the
tenth
and
d.c.
circuits
which
are
here
today.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bell
would
that
be
so
in
a
case
where
the
only
existing
bank
was
a
branch
bank
of
a
state
bank?
mr.
james
f.
bell
the
statute
only
refers
to
the
word
bank.
it
does
not
refer
to
the
word
branch
and
therefore
you
are
correct
in
your
understanding
that
there
may
be
a
branch
in
a
city
in
utah
in
which
there
are
only
branches.
the
purpose
of
the
utah
statute
clearly
was
to
protect
the
small
unit
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir
because
a
state
bank
may
do
so.
now,
the
comptroller
would
read
the
utah
statute
differently
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
see
the
two-point
program
that
is
followed
in
terms
of
the
way
he
construes
the
utah
statute.
the
first
thing
that
he
does
is
to
translate
a
statute
that
says,
“no
branch
may
be
established
where
there
is
an
existing
bank
except
as
a
result
of
a
merger
into
a
provision
that
says
any
branch
may
be
established
in
a
city
where
there
is
located
an
existing
branch
by
the
method
or
procedure
of
take
over.”
then
having
established
the
concept
of
method
or
procedure
by
merger
or
takeover,
he
argues
that
method
or
procedure
are
not
the
type
of
restrictions
to
be
found
under
congressional
history
and
in
any
event
ought
to
be
read
out
of
the
statute
because
they
are
contrary
to
federal
anti
trust
statutes.
the
conclusion
therefore
that
he
reaches
is
that
under
a
statute
which
says
that
a
national
bank
may
only
be
authorized
to
establish
a
branch
if
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
under
state
law
is
that
a
national
bank
may
establish
de
novo
branches
in
the
city
of
--
in
the
state
of
utah
where
there
are
presently
located
branches
even
though
such
branches
are
specifically
prohibited
to
state
banks.
this
is
a
unique
construction
by
the
incumbent
comptroller
for
36
years
following
the
passage
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927.
there
was
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
in
the
matter
of
branching.
there
are
now
11
states
other
than
the
state
of
utah
which
have
almost
identical
statutes
and
they
include
such
important
states
as
new
york
and
massachusetts.
now,
under
the
comptroller's
construction,
state
banks
in
all
of
these
12
states
face
one
of
two
alternatives.
they
obviously
cannot
continue
to
compete
under
a
situation
where
their
national
bank
competitors
have
a
fundamental
right
to
branch
which
they
do
not
and
therefore
they
would
be
force
to
convert
to
national
banks
thus
destroying
the
dual
banking
system
in
12
states
in
our
country
containing
a
substantial
part
of
the
assets
of
all
state
banks
in
the
country.
secondly,
they
could
move
to
the
state
legislature
and
have
the
state
legislature
change
the
established
branching
policy
in
every
one
of
these
12
states
in
order
to
conform
to
the
comptroller's
ruling.
accordingly,
we
believe
that
the
importance
of
this
case
to
the
banking
industry
cannot
be
overstated.
in
our
opinion
the
central
and
controlling
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
question
of
congressional
intent
and
that
is
where
i
intend
to
spend
the
bulk
of
my
time.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
would
like
to
make
four
brief
points
with
regard
to
the
comptroller's
argument
particularly
as
it
was
set
forth
in
his
brief.
first
of
all,
we
do
not
agree
with
his
translating
the
utah
statute
from
a
restricted
branch
banking
statute
with
an
exception
in
the
case
of
a
branch
resulting
from
merger
into
an
unrestricted
statute
through
a
methodology
or
procedure
of
merger.
my
colleague,
mr.
jones,
will
address
himself
to
that
point
and
will
demonstrate
in
the
--
on
the
basis
of
utah's
supreme
court
decisions
construing
the
utah
statute
that
this
is
a
restricted
prohibitive
statute.
secondly,
we
really
have
a
deep
conceptual
problem
with
the
relevancy
of
the
whole
argument
of
the
comptroller
because
as
we
understand
it,
his
quarrel
is
with
joining
a
prohibition
against
de
novo
branching
on
the
one
hand
with
a
permission
to
operate
a
branch
resulting
from
a
merger
on
the
other
hand.
he
attacks
this
take
over
provision
and
says
that
it
was
unintended
by
congress
or
it
is
against
federal
statutes
relating
to
banking
competition.
but
if
this
is
knocked
out,
what
is
left?
a
prohibition
against
de
novo
branching
in
utah
and
the
comptroller
could
improve
the
application
anyway.
second
--
thirdly,
we
have
a
deep
problem
with
the
arguments
that
he
is
advancing
even
in
favor
of
this
proposition
because
as
we
understand
it,
he
says
that
a
take
over
provision
encourages
bank
mergers
or
in
--
which
is
contrary
--
which
develops
banking
concentration.
but
the
comptroller
has
completely
lost
we
submit
the
difference
between
a
de
novo
branch
and
a
branch
resulting
from
a
merger.
a
de
novo
branch
is
a
completely
independent
transaction
that
is
considered
separately
under
the
statutes
by
the
respective
banking
agencies.
a
branch
resulting
from
a
merger
that
is
a
take
over
is
by
definition
something
that
results
from
another
transaction
namely
the
merger
itself.
and
congress
has
provided
in
the
sherman
act
and
in
the
clayton
act
and
in
the
bank
merger
act
for
a
thorough
study
of
any
bank
merger
and
all
the
evils
of
banking
concentration
etcetera
that
you
read
in
the
comptroller's
brief
are
all
taken
care
of
and
handled
in
the
consideration
of
a
merger.
so
that
the
question
of
what
happens
to
a
branch
following
a
merger
doesn't
even
arise
until
a
merger
has
been
considered
and
studied.
and
then
state
policy
says
in
some
states,
“you
may
not
continue
the
branch
of
the
--
the
office
of
the
acquiring
bank
as
a
branch.”
or
other
states
such
as
utah
may
say
that
if
a
merger
has
been
approved
and
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest
we
believe
that
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
continued
operation
of
the
offices
of
the
acquired
bank
as
a
merger
--
as
a
branch
and
fourth
and
finally
we
submit
that
the
comptroller's
argument
is
shot
through
with
self-inconsistency.
the
whole
thrust
of
his
case
relates
to
banking
concentration
but
let's
just
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
first
security
bank
is
the
largest
bank
in
utah.
it
has
45
branches
in
34
cities.
it
has
33%
of
all
of
the
banking
offices
in
utah.
it
has
$360
million
in
assets
which
is
six
times
that
of
the
commercial
security
bank.
now,
what
is
the
result
of
the
comptroller's
construction
of
the
statute
in
this
case?
that
the
largest
branch
in
the
state
of
utah
now
has
permission
to
go
out
to
establish
de
novo
branches
in
37
other
cities
in
a
state
where
there
are
presently
state
banks
operating
who
would
be
prohibited
from
establishing
de
novo
branches
themselves
in
order
to
meet
this
competition.
what
are
utah
banks
going
to
do?
they
only
have
three
choices.
they
may
go
and
try
to
acquire
a
branch
by
a
merger
but
if
they
do
that
that
is
really
encouraging
mergers
and
the
encouragement
of
mergers
is
not
from
the
take
over
provision
but
would
result
directly
from
the
comptroller's
construction
of
a
statute.
what
is
the
second
thing
they
can
do?
they
can
change
their
law
and
have
statewide
branch
banking.
that
then
would
give
open
sesame
to
the
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
utah
to
go
out
and
establish
branches
anywhere.
what
is
the
third
thing
they
can
do?
the
legislature
can
change
the
statute
and
abolish
all
branch
banking
and
that
ironically
is
180
degrees
opposite
to
what
the
comptroller
is
arguing
because
he
believes
that
branches
encourage
competition.
basically,
in
our
opinion,
the
whole
thrust,
the
entire
thrust
of
the
comptroller's
argument
in
this
case
is
--
it
results
from
the
imposition
of
an
economic
theory
relating
to
bank
mergers
onto
de
novo
branches
and
results
in
a
misconstruction
of
a
statute
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
let's
go
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
36
(c)
and
this
whole
question
of
competitive
equality.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bell
you're
absolutely
correct
sir.
this
is
a
unique
and
brand
new
construction
of
a
statute.
i
think
it's
also
significant
to
note
that
throughout
this
entire
36
years,
there
were
statutes
exactly
like
those
in
the
utah
statute
today.
i
would
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
in
our
briefs
we
cite
a
statute
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
bank
--
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
seven
statutes
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
banking
act
of
1933
which
reenacted
section
36
(c)
(1).
mr.
james
f.
bell
i
believe
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
massachusetts
was
i
--
as
i
recall
one
and
i
think
new
york
was
the
other,
i'm
not
sure
sir.
i
would
like
to
cite
if
i
might
before
i
move
directly
in
the
section
36
(c),
a
brief
historic
or
economic
settlement
setting
for
our
argument.
now,
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
point
that
i
believe
mr.
perry
raised
that
national
banks
are
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government
and
subject
to
the
paramount
law
of
the
united
states.
this
issue
was
decided
in
the
great
constitutional
debates
of
the
first
and
second
banks
of
the
united
states
and
finally
by
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
in
mccullough
versus
maryland
in
1890
nor
do
we
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
congress
could
have
if
it
wanted
have
barred
all
applicability
of
state
law
so
that
the
pivotable
issue
here
is
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
congress
intended
to
permit
the
applicability
of
state
law
and
indeed
to
adopt
state
law.
now,
as
a
matter
of
practical
economic
fact,
this
was
a
question
which
congress
had
to
decide
because
you
cannot
have
9500
state
banks
on
the
one
hand
and
4500
national
banks
on
the
other
hand
operating
together
in
a
competitive
atmosphere
if
one
of
the
other
class
of
these
banks
hold
substantially
greater
privileges
than
the
other.
now,
we
make
--
how
--
we
make
no
contention
of
course
that
the
national
bank
act
in
any
way
tries
to
meet
all
of
these
but
as
i'll
show
you
in
a
moment
they
do
meet
the
most
important
ones.
now,
how
could
congress
have
solved
this
question?
first
of
all,
it
could
have
completely
ignored
state
law
and
set
up
national
banks
regulation
entirely
for
national
banks.
in
that
case,
every
time
a
substantial
privilege
was
granted
to
a
national
bank
by
congress,
50
state
legislatures
would
have
to
go
into
session
in
order
to
meet
that
privilege
in
order
to
maintain
competitive
equality.
or
if
one
of
the
50
states
came
up
with
a
substantial
privilege
for
the
banks
in
its
states
and
congress
to
meet
that
had
to
change
its
law
then
the
other
49
states
would
have
to
change
their
law
again
and
so
on.
in
addition
to
this
practical
problem,
there
was
the
question
of
whether
bank
branching
should
be
regulated
in
terms
of
what
regional
possibilities
may
be.
in
other
words
there
are
instances
where
a
national
policy
really
doesn't
fit
the
banking
industry.
and
i
think
the
best
instance
of
this
for
example
is
in
branching.
some
states
for
example
illinois,
they
are
greatly
the
chicago
banks
branching
throughout
the
states
which
would
put
the
unit
banks
out
of
business.
accordingly
in
illinois
all
branch
banking
is
forbidden.
in
a
state
like
maryland
for
example,
where
there
is
no
one
city
that
dominates
the
whole
state,
statewide
branch
banking
is
permitted
so
that
you
have
16
states
in
the
union
that
prohibit
all
branching.
twelve
which
permits
statewide
branching
and
then
22
of
them
have
a
middle
ground.
they
have
various
county
provisions,
numbers
of
banks,
distances
from
banks,
salt
lake
city
for
example
in
utah
may
be
unlimited
branching
but
it's
restricted
in
the
rest
of
the
state.
now,
the
alternative
to
simply
ignoring
state
law
was
to
adopt
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
called
the
policy
of
equalization.
and
in
the
lewis
and
fidelity
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
page
14
and
15
of
our
briefs,
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
construing
a
1930
amendment
to
the
national
bank
act
as
to
whether
or
not
the
security
permitted
there
if
a
state
deposits,
was
they
restricted
or
a
broad
security
specifically
went
through
several
provisions
in
the
national
bank
act
where
congress
had
adopted
state
law
in
--
either
in
its
entirety
or
in
other
forms
as
the
standard
for
the
regulation
of
national
bank
branches.
now
this
is
exactly
the
way
the
law
stands
today.
now,
nowhere
that
we've
been
able
to
find
in
the
entire
history
of
a
national
bank
act
has
there
ever
been
a
more
definite
and
clear
cut
establishment
of
the
policy
of
equalization
or
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
by
the
adoption
of
state
law
as
the
standard
for
branches
of
national
banks
then
in
the
great
banking
debates
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
the
banking
act
of
1933.
and
at
pages
18
through
32
of
our
brief
we
have
outlined
in
great
detail
the
legislative
history
with
specific
statements
not
implications
of
tone
or
generalizations
but
specifically
quoted
statements
throughout
this
entire
legislative
history
to
establish
that
fact.
now
i
won't
repeat
that
legislative
history
in
it's
entirely
obviously
in
my
argument
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
salient
points
to
demonstrate
that
error
in
the
comptroller's
argument
that
congress
in
fact
intended
to
adopt
competitive
inequality
in
a
state
with
the
utah
type
statute.
now,
his
argument
as
we
understand
it
runs
something
like
this.
the
legislative
history
revolve
exclusively
around
a
debate
between
the
proponents
of
branch
banking
seeking
to
extend
this
as
a
useful
form
of
banking
and
the
opponents
of
branch
banking
who
feared
banking
concentration.
then
he
says
that
section
36
(c)
represents
a
compromise
involving
a
concession
of
proponents
to
opponents
and
that
a
takeover
provision
would
be
associated
and
i
quote
“in
the
minds
of
the
opponents”
with
banking
concentration
and
therefore
was
not
intended
as
a
restriction
to
be
applicable
to
national
banks.
in
our
view
this
is
an
interesting
but
utterly
strange
and
utterly
unsupported
conception
of
the
legislative
history.
let's
go
to
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
which
is
the
act
involved
here.
that
legislation
did
not
turn
upon
any
debate
as
to
whether
branch
banking
would
be
useful
or
not
useful.
it
turned
upon
one
simple
fact
that
prior
to
1927
the
national
banks
could
branch
at
all
and
that
by
about
1923
there
were
20
states
that
permitted
branch
banking
primarily
in
cities
so
that
when
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
his
1924
report
said
this,
“the
question
as
to
whether
national
banks
may
be
granted
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
competition
of
state
banks
in
intra-city
banking
in
my
opinion
involves
the
question
of
the
perpetuation
of
the
national
banking
system.”
this
was
not
a
debate
on
economic
merits
of
branch
banking.
it
was
a
debate
on
competitive
equality
and
the
survival
of
the
national
banking
system.
how
did
congress
solve
that
problem?
it
permitted
the
national
banks
to
branch
within
a
city.
it
permitted
by
state
law
and
then
it
restricted
the
members
of
the
fed
--
state
number
banks
of
the
federal
reserve
system
to
intra-city
banking
thereby
establishing
competitive
equality
on
intra-city
banking.
and
when
mr.
mcfadden,
the
author
of
the
bill
and
i
just
want
to
read
two
sentences
because
i
think
these
are
significant
sentences
that
demonstrate
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1927.
the
business
of
banking
is
a
competitive
commercial
enterprise
like
any
other
business
which
makes
a
profit
to
the
rendition
of
service
to
the
public.
under
our
financial
system
where
in
each
state
of
the
union
there
are
two
systems
of
banking
national
and
state,
each
in
natural
competition
with
the
other
for
business,
it
is
necessary
for
their
mutual
existence
that
their
charter
powers
be
substantially
equal.
now
and
this
may
answer
i
believe
a
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
early
in
the
argument.
the
question
of
whether
it
was
truly
to
be
a
state
law
that
was
to
control
and
in
our
brief
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927,
we
discussed
something
called
the
hull
amendments.
they
were
proposed
by
the
house
and
was
rejected
by
the
senate.
now,
the
hull
amendments
--
were
--
were
a
group
of
amendments
that
tried
to
say,
there
will
be
competitive
equality
based
on
state
law
as
it
exists
right
now.
the
obvious
reasoning
behind
this
was
that
this
would
energize
the
national
banks
to
try
to
keep
state
law
from
ever
being
changed
to
permit
branching
in
states
where
it
was
then
prohibited
because
then
it
be
back
in
a
competitive
inequality
again.
and
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee
quoted
on
page
22
says,
“construe
this
whole
thing
as
to
coerce
the
states
to
remain
silent.
your
committee
feels
that
this
is
an
unprecedented
policy
for
the
federal
government
to
pursue
and
constitutes
an
unwarranted
interference
with
the
rights
of
citizens
and
these
states
in
their
relationships
to
state
legislatures.”
finally,
when
the
mcfadden
act
passed,
mr.
mcfadden
himself
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
establish
competitive
equality.
now,
where
are
all
these
restrictions
that
we're
talking
--
that
we
have
heard
from
the
able
opposition?
the
language
is
permitted
with
incidentally
the
word
used
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
it
was
strengthened
in
the
banking
act
of
1933,
the
word
“permitted”
was
made
expressly
authorized
which
even
strengthen
the
point
that
we're
making.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
define
exactly
what
is
the
limit
of
the
restrictions
that
were
involved
here.
there
are
two
that
are
clearly
not
included.
one
is
capital
for
branches.
congress
has
separated
that
out,
has
applied
state
law
for
outside
capital
--
state
law
relating
to
capital
for
outside
branches
but
not
for
inside
branches.
the
other
is
this
question
of
need.
certainly,
we
never
intend
any
construction
of
the
statute
in
that
effect
of
which
would
be
to
have
the
comptroller
ask
the
judgment
opinion
of
the
supervisor
of
banking
in
any
state.
but
beyond
that
when
congress
said
“expressly
authorized”
it
meant
that
and
if
congress
had
intended
that
state
statutes
which
prohibited
de
novo
branching
but
permitted
the
retention
of
branches
resulting
from
a
merger
meant
unrestricted
de
novo
branches
for
national
banks
that
were
prohibited
to
state
banks
it
could
have
said
so
because
these
statutes
were
always
present.
now,
i
could
go
on
in
the
banking
act
of
1933
to
develop
the
competitive
equality
point.
senator
glass
proposed
a
bill,
in
that
effect
which
was
to
abolish
competitive
equality
by
giving
national
banks
the
right
to
branch
without
regard
to
state
law.
he
lost.
the
bratton
amendment
which
came
in
and
became
the
law
contained
this
philosophy
as
expressed
by
senator
bratton.
the
question
of
whether
branch
banking
shall
be
determined
is
by
that
state
and
we
are
asked
to
permit
national
banks
in
disregard
of
state
laws
overwriting
the
sentiment
of
a
state
to
engage
in
branch
banking
whether
it
is
desired
in
the
state
or
not.
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument
by
reference
to
cases
which
are
set
forth
in
some
detail
at
--
in
our
brief
in
which
the
whole
legislative
history
has
been
exhaustively
considered
by
a
number
of
courts.
certainly,
it
was
considered
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
it
is
so
been
held
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
the
sixth
circuit
as
well
as
district
courts
in
several
circuits.
now
all
of
these
cases
you
will
note
with
the
exception
of
two
have
arisen
since
1960
during
the
term
of
the
incumbent
comptroller
of
the
currency.
i
have
cited
and
i
believe
it's
fair
to
state
that
the
existing
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
restive
with
being
bound
by
state
laws.
and
the
15
or
so
cases
that
have
arisen
in
the
lower
courts
i
believe
reflect
that
restiveness
as
indicated
in
his
constructions
of
section
36
(c).
and
we
ask
this
court
to
put
an
end
to
that
unrest
by
holding
that
when
congress
enacted
36
(c)
it
is
intended
to
establish
competitive
equality
not
competitive
inequality
and
in
our
view
the
comptroller's
construction
is
inconsistent
with
this
intent
upon
which
depends
the
entire
viability
of
the
dual
banking
system.
mr.
james
f.
bell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
commercial
security
bank
in
cases
73
and
88.
this
is
the
so-called
ogden
case
arising
from
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jones,
my
colleague,
is
the
counsel
for
the
walker
bank
and
trust
company
in
51
which
arises
in
the
tenth
circuit
of
branches
in
logan.
the
issues
in
both
cases
are
identical
and
it
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
the
principal
statute
is
section
36
(c)
(1)
of
the
national
bank
act
which
permits
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
approve
an
application
of
a
national
bank
for
an
in-town
branch
if
the
establishment
of
such
a
branch
and
i
now
read
from
the
statutory
language
which
we
believe
is
significant,
“is
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question.”
now,
the
state
in
question
here
is
utah
and
the
applicable
provision
of
the
utah
code
reads
are
follows,
“no
branch
bank
shall
be
established
in
any
city
or
town
in
which
is
located
a
bank
or
banks,
state
or
national,
unless
the
bank
seeking
to
establish
such
branch
shall
take
over
an
existing
bank.”
now,
we
read
the
utah
statute
as
containing
two
clear
cut
provisions.
first
of
all,
it
contains
a
flat
prohibition
against
any
de
novo
branches.
secondly,
it
contains
permission
to
operate
an
acquired
bank
as
a
branch
following
an
acquisition.
the
first
of
these
provisions
is
the
one
applicable
in
this
case.
the
first
security
national
bank
has
applied
to
establish
a
de
novo
branch
in
the
city
of
ogden
which
is
a
city
with
four
existing
banks.
and
we
contend
that
a
de
novo
branch
of
a
national
bank
is
not
expressly
authorized
by
a
state
statute
which
prohibits
de
novo
branching
in
any
city
with
operating
banks.
this
is
basically
the
decision
of
the
tenth
and
d.c.
circuits
which
are
here
today.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bell
would
that
be
so
in
a
case
where
the
only
existing
bank
was
a
branch
bank
of
a
state
bank?
mr.
james
f.
bell
the
statute
only
refers
to
the
word
bank.
it
does
not
refer
to
the
word
branch
and
therefore
you
are
correct
in
your
understanding
that
there
may
be
a
branch
in
a
city
in
utah
in
which
there
are
only
branches.
the
purpose
of
the
utah
statute
clearly
was
to
protect
the
small
unit
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir
because
a
state
bank
may
do
so.
now,
the
comptroller
would
read
the
utah
statute
differently
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
see
the
two-point
program
that
is
followed
in
terms
of
the
way
he
construes
the
utah
statute.
the
first
thing
that
he
does
is
to
translate
a
statute
that
says,
“no
branch
may
be
established
where
there
is
an
existing
bank
except
as
a
result
of
a
merger
into
a
provision
that
says
any
branch
may
be
established
in
a
city
where
there
is
located
an
existing
branch
by
the
method
or
procedure
of
take
over.”
then
having
established
the
concept
of
method
or
procedure
by
merger
or
takeover,
he
argues
that
method
or
procedure
are
not
the
type
of
restrictions
to
be
found
under
congressional
history
and
in
any
event
ought
to
be
read
out
of
the
statute
because
they
are
contrary
to
federal
anti
trust
statutes.
the
conclusion
therefore
that
he
reaches
is
that
under
a
statute
which
says
that
a
national
bank
may
only
be
authorized
to
establish
a
branch
if
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
under
state
law
is
that
a
national
bank
may
establish
de
novo
branches
in
the
city
of
--
in
the
state
of
utah
where
there
are
presently
located
branches
even
though
such
branches
are
specifically
prohibited
to
state
banks.
this
is
a
unique
construction
by
the
incumbent
comptroller
for
36
years
following
the
passage
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927.
there
was
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
in
the
matter
of
branching.
there
are
now
11
states
other
than
the
state
of
utah
which
have
almost
identical
statutes
and
they
include
such
important
states
as
new
york
and
massachusetts.
now,
under
the
comptroller's
construction,
state
banks
in
all
of
these
12
states
face
one
of
two
alternatives.
they
obviously
cannot
continue
to
compete
under
a
situation
where
their
national
bank
competitors
have
a
fundamental
right
to
branch
which
they
do
not
and
therefore
they
would
be
force
to
convert
to
national
banks
thus
destroying
the
dual
banking
system
in
12
states
in
our
country
containing
a
substantial
part
of
the
assets
of
all
state
banks
in
the
country.
secondly,
they
could
move
to
the
state
legislature
and
have
the
state
legislature
change
the
established
branching
policy
in
every
one
of
these
12
states
in
order
to
conform
to
the
comptroller's
ruling.
accordingly,
we
believe
that
the
importance
of
this
case
to
the
banking
industry
cannot
be
overstated.
in
our
opinion
the
central
and
controlling
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
question
of
congressional
intent
and
that
is
where
i
intend
to
spend
the
bulk
of
my
time.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
would
like
to
make
four
brief
points
with
regard
to
the
comptroller's
argument
particularly
as
it
was
set
forth
in
his
brief.
first
of
all,
we
do
not
agree
with
his
translating
the
utah
statute
from
a
restricted
branch
banking
statute
with
an
exception
in
the
case
of
a
branch
resulting
from
merger
into
an
unrestricted
statute
through
a
methodology
or
procedure
of
merger.
my
colleague,
mr.
jones,
will
address
himself
to
that
point
and
will
demonstrate
in
the
--
on
the
basis
of
utah's
supreme
court
decisions
construing
the
utah
statute
that
this
is
a
restricted
prohibitive
statute.
secondly,
we
really
have
a
deep
conceptual
problem
with
the
relevancy
of
the
whole
argument
of
the
comptroller
because
as
we
understand
it,
his
quarrel
is
with
joining
a
prohibition
against
de
novo
branching
on
the
one
hand
with
a
permission
to
operate
a
branch
resulting
from
a
merger
on
the
other
hand.
he
attacks
this
take
over
provision
and
says
that
it
was
unintended
by
congress
or
it
is
against
federal
statutes
relating
to
banking
competition.
but
if
this
is
knocked
out,
what
is
left?
a
prohibition
against
de
novo
branching
in
utah
and
the
comptroller
could
improve
the
application
anyway.
second
--
thirdly,
we
have
a
deep
problem
with
the
arguments
that
he
is
advancing
even
in
favor
of
this
proposition
because
as
we
understand
it,
he
says
that
a
take
over
provision
encourages
bank
mergers
or
in
--
which
is
contrary
--
which
develops
banking
concentration.
but
the
comptroller
has
completely
lost
we
submit
the
difference
between
a
de
novo
branch
and
a
branch
resulting
from
a
merger.
a
de
novo
branch
is
a
completely
independent
transaction
that
is
considered
separately
under
the
statutes
by
the
respective
banking
agencies.
a
branch
resulting
from
a
merger
that
is
a
take
over
is
by
definition
something
that
results
from
another
transaction
namely
the
merger
itself.
and
congress
has
provided
in
the
sherman
act
and
in
the
clayton
act
and
in
the
bank
merger
act
for
a
thorough
study
of
any
bank
merger
and
all
the
evils
of
banking
concentration
etcetera
that
you
read
in
the
comptroller's
brief
are
all
taken
care
of
and
handled
in
the
consideration
of
a
merger.
so
that
the
question
of
what
happens
to
a
branch
following
a
merger
doesn't
even
arise
until
a
merger
has
been
considered
and
studied.
and
then
state
policy
says
in
some
states,
“you
may
not
continue
the
branch
of
the
--
the
office
of
the
acquiring
bank
as
a
branch.”
or
other
states
such
as
utah
may
say
that
if
a
merger
has
been
approved
and
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest
we
believe
that
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
continued
operation
of
the
offices
of
the
acquired
bank
as
a
merger
--
as
a
branch
and
fourth
and
finally
we
submit
that
the
comptroller's
argument
is
shot
through
with
self-inconsistency.
the
whole
thrust
of
his
case
relates
to
banking
concentration
but
let's
just
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
first
security
bank
is
the
largest
bank
in
utah.
it
has
45
branches
in
34
cities.
it
has
33%
of
all
of
the
banking
offices
in
utah.
it
has
$360
million
in
assets
which
is
six
times
that
of
the
commercial
security
bank.
now,
what
is
the
result
of
the
comptroller's
construction
of
the
statute
in
this
case?
that
the
largest
branch
in
the
state
of
utah
now
has
permission
to
go
out
to
establish
de
novo
branches
in
37
other
cities
in
a
state
where
there
are
presently
state
banks
operating
who
would
be
prohibited
from
establishing
de
novo
branches
themselves
in
order
to
meet
this
competition.
what
are
utah
banks
going
to
do?
they
only
have
three
choices.
they
may
go
and
try
to
acquire
a
branch
by
a
merger
but
if
they
do
that
that
is
really
encouraging
mergers
and
the
encouragement
of
mergers
is
not
from
the
take
over
provision
but
would
result
directly
from
the
comptroller's
construction
of
a
statute.
what
is
the
second
thing
they
can
do?
they
can
change
their
law
and
have
statewide
branch
banking.
that
then
would
give
open
sesame
to
the
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
utah
to
go
out
and
establish
branches
anywhere.
what
is
the
third
thing
they
can
do?
the
legislature
can
change
the
statute
and
abolish
all
branch
banking
and
that
ironically
is
180
degrees
opposite
to
what
the
comptroller
is
arguing
because
he
believes
that
branches
encourage
competition.
basically,
in
our
opinion,
the
whole
thrust,
the
entire
thrust
of
the
comptroller's
argument
in
this
case
is
--
it
results
from
the
imposition
of
an
economic
theory
relating
to
bank
mergers
onto
de
novo
branches
and
results
in
a
misconstruction
of
a
statute
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
let's
go
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
36
(c)
and
this
whole
question
of
competitive
equality.
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bell
you're
absolutely
correct
sir.
this
is
a
unique
and
brand
new
construction
of
a
statute.
i
think
it's
also
significant
to
note
that
throughout
this
entire
36
years,
there
were
statutes
exactly
like
those
in
the
utah
statute
today.
i
would
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
yes
sir.
in
our
briefs
we
cite
a
statute
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
bank
--
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
seven
statutes
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
banking
act
of
1933
which
reenacted
section
36
(c)
(1).
mr.
james
f.
bell
i
believe
--
mr.
james
f.
bell
massachusetts
was
i
--
as
i
recall
one
and
i
think
new
york
was
the
other,
i'm
not
sure
sir.
i
would
like
to
cite
if
i
might
before
i
move
directly
in
the
section
36
(c),
a
brief
historic
or
economic
settlement
setting
for
our
argument.
now,
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
point
that
i
believe
mr.
perry
raised
that
national
banks
are
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government
and
subject
to
the
paramount
law
of
the
united
states.
this
issue
was
decided
in
the
great
constitutional
debates
of
the
first
and
second
banks
of
the
united
states
and
finally
by
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
in
mccullough
versus
maryland
in
1890
nor
do
we
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
congress
could
have
if
it
wanted
have
barred
all
applicability
of
state
law
so
that
the
pivotable
issue
here
is
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
congress
intended
to
permit
the
applicability
of
state
law
and
indeed
to
adopt
state
law.
now,
as
a
matter
of
practical
economic
fact,
this
was
a
question
which
congress
had
to
decide
because
you
cannot
have
9500
state
banks
on
the
one
hand
and
4500
national
banks
on
the
other
hand
operating
together
in
a
competitive
atmosphere
if
one
of
the
other
class
of
these
banks
hold
substantially
greater
privileges
than
the
other.
now,
we
make
--
how
--
we
make
no
contention
of
course
that
the
national
bank
act
in
any
way
tries
to
meet
all
of
these
but
as
i'll
show
you
in
a
moment
they
do
meet
the
most
important
ones.
now,
how
could
congress
have
solved
this
question?
first
of
all,
it
could
have
completely
ignored
state
law
and
set
up
national
banks
regulation
entirely
for
national
banks.
in
that
case,
every
time
a
substantial
privilege
was
granted
to
a
national
bank
by
congress,
50
state
legislatures
would
have
to
go
into
session
in
order
to
meet
that
privilege
in
order
to
maintain
competitive
equality.
or
if
one
of
the
50
states
came
up
with
a
substantial
privilege
for
the
banks
in
its
states
and
congress
to
meet
that
had
to
change
its
law
then
the
other
49
states
would
have
to
change
their
law
again
and
so
on.
in
addition
to
this
practical
problem,
there
was
the
question
of
whether
bank
branching
should
be
regulated
in
terms
of
what
regional
possibilities
may
be.
in
other
words
there
are
instances
where
a
national
policy
really
doesn't
fit
the
banking
industry.
and
i
think
the
best
instance
of
this
for
example
is
in
branching.
some
states
for
example
illinois,
they
are
greatly
the
chicago
banks
branching
throughout
the
states
which
would
put
the
unit
banks
out
of
business.
accordingly
in
illinois
all
branch
banking
is
forbidden.
in
a
state
like
maryland
for
example,
where
there
is
no
one
city
that
dominates
the
whole
state,
statewide
branch
banking
is
permitted
so
that
you
have
16
states
in
the
union
that
prohibit
all
branching.
twelve
which
permits
statewide
branching
and
then
22
of
them
have
a
middle
ground.
they
have
various
county
provisions,
numbers
of
banks,
distances
from
banks,
salt
lake
city
for
example
in
utah
may
be
unlimited
branching
but
it's
restricted
in
the
rest
of
the
state.
now,
the
alternative
to
simply
ignoring
state
law
was
to
adopt
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
called
the
policy
of
equalization.
and
in
the
lewis
and
fidelity
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
page
14
and
15
of
our
briefs,
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
construing
a
1930
amendment
to
the
national
bank
act
as
to
whether
or
not
the
security
permitted
there
if
a
state
deposits,
was
they
restricted
or
a
broad
security
specifically
went
through
several
provisions
in
the
national
bank
act
where
congress
had
adopted
state
law
in
--
either
in
its
entirety
or
in
other
forms
as
the
standard
for
the
regulation
of
national
bank
branches.
now
this
is
exactly
the
way
the
law
stands
today.
now,
nowhere
that
we've
been
able
to
find
in
the
entire
history
of
a
national
bank
act
has
there
ever
been
a
more
definite
and
clear
cut
establishment
of
the
policy
of
equalization
or
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
by
the
adoption
of
state
law
as
the
standard
for
branches
of
national
banks
then
in
the
great
banking
debates
of
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
the
banking
act
of
1933.
and
at
pages
18
through
32
of
our
brief
we
have
outlined
in
great
detail
the
legislative
history
with
specific
statements
not
implications
of
tone
or
generalizations
but
specifically
quoted
statements
throughout
this
entire
legislative
history
to
establish
that
fact.
now
i
won't
repeat
that
legislative
history
in
it's
entirely
obviously
in
my
argument
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
salient
points
to
demonstrate
that
error
in
the
comptroller's
argument
that
congress
in
fact
intended
to
adopt
competitive
inequality
in
a
state
with
the
utah
type
statute.
now,
his
argument
as
we
understand
it
runs
something
like
this.
the
legislative
history
revolve
exclusively
around
a
debate
between
the
proponents
of
branch
banking
seeking
to
extend
this
as
a
useful
form
of
banking
and
the
opponents
of
branch
banking
who
feared
banking
concentration.
then
he
says
that
section
36
(c)
represents
a
compromise
involving
a
concession
of
proponents
to
opponents
and
that
a
takeover
provision
would
be
associated
and
i
quote
“in
the
minds
of
the
opponents”
with
banking
concentration
and
therefore
was
not
intended
as
a
restriction
to
be
applicable
to
national
banks.
in
our
view
this
is
an
interesting
but
utterly
strange
and
utterly
unsupported
conception
of
the
legislative
history.
let's
go
to
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
which
is
the
act
involved
here.
that
legislation
did
not
turn
upon
any
debate
as
to
whether
branch
banking
would
be
useful
or
not
useful.
it
turned
upon
one
simple
fact
that
prior
to
1927
the
national
banks
could
branch
at
all
and
that
by
about
1923
there
were
20
states
that
permitted
branch
banking
primarily
in
cities
so
that
when
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
his
1924
report
said
this,
“the
question
as
to
whether
national
banks
may
be
granted
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
competition
of
state
banks
in
intra-city
banking
in
my
opinion
involves
the
question
of
the
perpetuation
of
the
national
banking
system.”
this
was
not
a
debate
on
economic
merits
of
branch
banking.
it
was
a
debate
on
competitive
equality
and
the
survival
of
the
national
banking
system.
how
did
congress
solve
that
problem?
it
permitted
the
national
banks
to
branch
within
a
city.
it
permitted
by
state
law
and
then
it
restricted
the
members
of
the
fed
--
state
number
banks
of
the
federal
reserve
system
to
intra-city
banking
thereby
establishing
competitive
equality
on
intra-city
banking.
and
when
mr.
mcfadden,
the
author
of
the
bill
and
i
just
want
to
read
two
sentences
because
i
think
these
are
significant
sentences
that
demonstrate
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1927.
the
business
of
banking
is
a
competitive
commercial
enterprise
like
any
other
business
which
makes
a
profit
to
the
rendition
of
service
to
the
public.
under
our
financial
system
where
in
each
state
of
the
union
there
are
two
systems
of
banking
national
and
state,
each
in
natural
competition
with
the
other
for
business,
it
is
necessary
for
their
mutual
existence
that
their
charter
powers
be
substantially
equal.
now
and
this
may
answer
i
believe
a
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
early
in
the
argument.
the
question
of
whether
it
was
truly
to
be
a
state
law
that
was
to
control
and
in
our
brief
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927,
we
discussed
something
called
the
hull
amendments.
they
were
proposed
by
the
house
and
was
rejected
by
the
senate.
now,
the
hull
amendments
--
were
--
were
a
group
of
amendments
that
tried
to
say,
there
will
be
competitive
equality
based
on
state
law
as
it
exists
right
now.
the
obvious
reasoning
behind
this
was
that
this
would
energize
the
national
banks
to
try
to
keep
state
law
from
ever
being
changed
to
permit
branching
in
states
where
it
was
then
prohibited
because
then
it
be
back
in
a
competitive
inequality
again.
and
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee
quoted
on
page
22
says,
“construe
this
whole
thing
as
to
coerce
the
states
to
remain
silent.
your
committee
feels
that
this
is
an
unprecedented
policy
for
the
federal
government
to
pursue
and
constitutes
an
unwarranted
interference
with
the
rights
of
citizens
and
these
states
in
their
relationships
to
state
legislatures.”
finally,
when
the
mcfadden
act
passed,
mr.
mcfadden
himself
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
establish
competitive
equality.
now,
where
are
all
these
restrictions
that
we're
talking
--
that
we
have
heard
from
the
able
opposition?
the
language
is
permitted
with
incidentally
the
word
used
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
and
it
was
strengthened
in
the
banking
act
of
1933,
the
word
“permitted”
was
made
expressly
authorized
which
even
strengthen
the
point
that
we're
making.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
define
exactly
what
is
the
limit
of
the
restrictions
that
were
involved
here.
there
are
two
that
are
clearly
not
included.
one
is
capital
for
branches.
congress
has
separated
that
out,
has
applied
state
law
for
outside
capital
--
state
law
relating
to
capital
for
outside
branches
but
not
for
inside
branches.
the
other
is
this
question
of
need.
certainly,
we
never
intend
any
construction
of
the
statute
in
that
effect
of
which
would
be
to
have
the
comptroller
ask
the
judgment
opinion
of
the
supervisor
of
banking
in
any
state.
but
beyond
that
when
congress
said
“expressly
authorized”
it
meant
that
and
if
congress
had
intended
that
state
statutes
which
prohibited
de
novo
branching
but
permitted
the
retention
of
branches
resulting
from
a
merger
meant
unrestricted
de
novo
branches
for
national
banks
that
were
prohibited
to
state
banks
it
could
have
said
so
because
these
statutes
were
always
present.
now,
i
could
go
on
in
the
banking
act
of
1933
to
develop
the
competitive
equality
point.
senator
glass
proposed
a
bill,
in
that
effect
which
was
to
abolish
competitive
equality
by
giving
national
banks
the
right
to
branch
without
regard
to
state
law.
he
lost.
the
bratton
amendment
which
came
in
and
became
the
law
contained
this
philosophy
as
expressed
by
senator
bratton.
the
question
of
whether
branch
banking
shall
be
determined
is
by
that
state
and
we
are
asked
to
permit
national
banks
in
disregard
of
state
laws
overwriting
the
sentiment
of
a
state
to
engage
in
branch
banking
whether
it
is
desired
in
the
state
or
not.
i
would
like
to
close
my
argument
by
reference
to
cases
which
are
set
forth
in
some
detail
at
--
in
our
brief
in
which
the
whole
legislative
history
has
been
exhaustively
considered
by
a
number
of
courts.
certainly,
it
was
considered
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
it
is
so
been
held
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
the
sixth
circuit
as
well
as
district
courts
in
several
circuits.
now
all
of
these
cases
you
will
note
with
the
exception
of
two
have
arisen
since
1960
during
the
term
of
the
incumbent
comptroller
of
the
currency.
i
have
cited
and
i
believe
it's
fair
to
state
that
the
existing
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
restive
with
being
bound
by
state
laws.
and
the
15
or
so
cases
that
have
arisen
in
the
lower
courts
i
believe
reflect
that
restiveness
as
indicated
in
his
constructions
of
section
36
(c).
and
we
ask
this
court
to
put
an
end
to
that
unrest
by
holding
that
when
congress
enacted
36
(c)
it
is
intended
to
establish
competitive
equality
not
competitive
inequality
and
in
our
view
the
comptroller's
construction
is
inconsistent
with
this
intent
upon
which
depends
the
entire
viability
of
the
dual
banking
system.
