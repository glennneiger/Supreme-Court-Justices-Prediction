the

act

u.s.c.

(c)
(1)
empowers
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
authorize
a
national
bank
to
establish
branches
within
its
home
municipality
if
such
establishment
is
permitted
to
the
state
banks
of
the
state

state
law.
utah's
banking
code
permits
its
state
charter
banks
to
establish
branches
within
the
bank's
home
municipality
and
indeed
anywhere
in
the
state.
but
it
provides
with
exceptions
that
are
not
relevant
here
that
a
branch
maybe
established
only
by
taking
over
by
purchase
or
merger
at
existing
bank.
and
the
sole
issue
in
this
three
consolidated
cases
is
whether
this
take
over

of
utah

is
binding
upon
the

and
the

of
appeals
sustained
this
challenge
to
the
comptroller
on
the
authority
of
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
logan
case.
we
believe
that
the
courts
below
were
an
error
in
holding
utah's
take
over
restriction
applicable
to
the
national
banks
and
i
propose
to
demonstrate
this
first
by
reviewing
the
history
of
section
36
(c)
of
the
banking
title
and
then
considering
the
language
and
design
of
the
federal
statute
of
section
36
(c)
in
the
light
of
this
critical
history.
now,
in
the
beginning,
the
national
banks
had
no
authority
to
establish
branches.
and
each
national
bank
was
limited
to
a
single
office.
this
created
no
problems
in
an
era
when
branch
banking
was
virtually
unheard
of
but
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
the
states
begin
increasingly
to
experiment
with
permitting
their
state
charter
banks
to
establish
branches.
and
this
development
lead
to
proposals
in
congress
beginning
in
the
early
1920's
to
give
the
national
banks
authority
to
establish
branches.
and
in
the
deliberations
on
these
proposals,
it
soon
became
evident
that
were
two
quite
antagonistic
schools
of
thought
on
the
subject
of
branch
banking.
one
school
believes
that
it
was
a
salutary
development
that
it
would
strengthen
the
banking
system
and
would
inject
greater
competition
into
it.
and
the
congressmen
who
held
this
view
proposed
that
the
national
banks
be
permitted
irrespective
of
state
law
to
establish
branches
throughout
the
state
in
which
they
were
located
and
even
to
a
limited
extent
in
other
states.
the
other
school
of
thought
held
that
branch
banking
was
an
evil.
and
the
reasons
they
gave
for
these
are
relevant
and
can
be
summarized
very
briefly.
they
were
concerned
with
the
absentee
ownership
of
a
community's
banking
facilities
with
the
problem
that
a
farmer
or
a
merchant
in
a
small
town
might
have
to
deal
with
a
bank
not
rooted
in
the
community.
a
manager
from
a
financial
corporation
located
elsewhere.
they
feared
also
urban
domination
by
affluent
city
banks
of
the
world
banking
markets
of
a
state.
and
finally
they
appeared
that
branch
banking
was
conducive
to
the
monopolization
of
a
state's
banking
industry
by
a
few
large
banks.
banks
which
would
spread
out
throughout
the
state
in
a
kind
of
tentacular
fashion
would
drive
out
the
smaller
independent
banks
throughout
the
state
and
lead
to
a
high
concentration
and
centralization
of
a
state
banking
industry.
and
this
congressional
group
thought
that
the
national
banks
should
remain
without
any
authority
to
branch.
now
in
the
states,
opinion
was
divided
on
this
controversy
between
the
two
schools
of
thought
on
branch
banking.
some
states
forebad
branch
banking
altogether.
others
permitted
it
but
within
very
narrow
circumscribe
bounds.
and
others
permitted
it
with
very
few
restrictions
and
this
division
in
the
states
was
reflected
in
the
bitter
and
protracted
debates
in
congress
stretching
over
a
decade
in
the
1920's
and
1930's
and
culminating
in
the
branch
banking
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
which
are
now
codified
in
section
36
(c).
in
the
end
of
course,
the
proponents
of
allowing
the
national
banks
to
have
branches
prevail,
but
not
without
a
compromise
with
the
opponents.
the
congressional
group
for
which
--
for
whom
branch
banking
was
an
anathema
was
simply
too
vocal
and
too
strong
to
be
completely
overwritten.
and
in
the
end
it
had
to
be
accommodated.
and
i
should
now
like
to
trace
the
terms
of
this
accommodation
between
the
proponents
and
opponents
of
branch
banking
in
the
actual
language
of
section
36
(c)
which
we
have
set
forth
on
pages
44
to
45
of
our
brief.
subsection
1,
which
is
the
provision
directly
relevant
here
provides
that
within
it's
home
municipality,
a
national
bank
with
a
comptrollers
permission
may
establish
branches
if
such
establishment
is
permitted
to
stay
chartered
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
national
bank
is
located.
and
the
congressional
purpose
here
is
plain,
if
a
state
so
completely
distrusts
the
institution
and
practice
of
branch
banking
as
to
forbid
it
all
together
even
within
a
bank's
home
town,
the
national
banks
located
in
the
state
are
likewise
forbidden
to
have
any
branches.
consider
now
subsection
2,
it
provides
that
the
comptroller
may
authorize
a
national
bank
to
establish
branches
outside
of
the
bank's
home
municipality
although
not
outside
of
the
state
upon
two
conditions.
first,
that
state
banks
enjoy
a
like
authority
to
establish
branches
outside
of
their
hometowns
and
secondly
subject
to
such
restrictions
as
to
location
which
the
state
may
impose
on
its
state
chartered
banks.
now,
a
state
might
look
with
relative
equanimity
upon
branching
with
inter-bank's
hometown
feeling
that
the
dangers
of
absentee
ownership
--
supposed
dangerous
of
absentee
ownership
and
monopolization
where
very
much
mitigated
where
branching
authority
is
limited
to
the
hometown
and
yet
decide
that
a
broader
authority
would
be
dangerous.
and
if
that
is
the
state's
decision
then
the
national
banks
are
likewise
limited
to
their
hometowns.
and
congress
refined
the
matter
still
further
by
providing
an
intermediate
position
between
hometown
branching
and
state
wide
branching.
there
are
some
states
like
pennsylvania
which
apparently
are
distrustful
of
statewide
branching
and
yet
feel
that
banks
should
be
able
to
follow
its
customers
to
the
suburbs
for
example.
and
so
provides
that
a
bank
may
establish
a
branch
within
its
home
county
and
also
within
contiguous
counties.
and
there
are
other
states
which
permit
branching
outside
of
the
hometown
within
a
given
mile
radius
within
25
or
100
miles.
and
so
the
state
should
decide
to
circumscribe
its
branch
banking
system
in
that
fashion,
the
national
banks
are
likewise
are
bound.
and
what
is
adds
up
to
is
that
if
the
state
–-
if
a
state
wants
to
create
a
limited
branch
banking
system,
if
it
wants
to
avert
or
at
least
contain
these
dangers
that
opponents
of
branch
banking
foresee
that
may
do
so
in
confidence
that
the
national
banks
located
in
the
state
cannot
subvert
its
policy
by
virtue
of
enjoying
a
broader
branching
authority.
and
so
if
the
state
of
utah
had
provided
that
its
banks
may
not
establish
branches
outside
of
their
home
municipality
or
outside
of
their
home
municipality
plus
adjacent
counties
or
beyond
a
certain
radius
of
the
bank's
home
office
and
such
a
policy
of
containing
branch
banking
would
bind
the
national
banks
in
the
state
no
less
than
if
utah
had
forbade
branch
banking
altogether.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
branches
would
not
be
within
the
expressed
language
of
the
–-
of
section
of
36
(c)
and
probably
is
not
a
necessary
implication
from
that
language
simply
because
a
state
can
place
limits
upon
its
branching
system
to
avert
these
dangers
of
centralization.
perhaps
most
effectively
by
setting
geographical
bounds
rather
than
by
saying
that
a
bank
may
have
15
branches
or
ten
branches
or
something
like
that.
we
do
recognize
that
that
would
present
a
more
difficult
question
in
the
restriction
in
issue
here
because
as
i
shall
try
to
suggest
now,
the
type
of
restriction
that
utah
has
imposed,
it
reflects
no
policy
of
limiting
a
state
branch
bank
system.
for
example
we
have
in
number
51,
as
the
respondent,
a
state
bank
which
has
14
branches
for
all
that
appears
well
distributed
throughout
the
state.
for
under
utah
law,
a
bank
may
establish
new
branches
both
within
its
home
municipality
and
anywhere
throughout
the
state.
we
have
for
example
as
petitioner,
number
73,
the
first
security
bank
of
utah,
a
bank
having
43
branches
in
34
cities
and
while
it's
true
that
this
is
a
national
bank,
had
utah
chosen
to
circumscribe
or
forbid
branch
banking
in
its
state,
national
banks
would
enjoy
no
greater
authority.
the
fact
is
that
all
utah
has
required
in
this
take
over
restriction
which
is
the
issue
here
is
that
all
branching
be
channeled
into
mergers.
and
this
is
a
restriction
wholly
unrelated
to
the
kind
of
concerns
which
cause
congress
in
section
36
(c)
to
permit
the
states
to
limit
the
branch
banking
systems
of
their
states.
there
is
nothing
in
utah
law
to
prevent
a
large
city
bank
like
walker
bank
which
is
a
salt
lake
city
bank
from
establishing
branches
all
over
the
state,
in
any
number
anywhere,
simply
by
purchasing
existing
banks.
and
in
fact
we
think
that
a
system
which
--
without
limiting
branching
directs
it
exclusively
into
the
merger
route,
promotes
the
very
centralization
and
monopolization
tendencies
with
which
congress
was
concerned
in
incorporating
some
portions
of
state
law
because
every
time
a
state
bank
of
utah
decides
to
open
a
branch,
it
must
take
over
an
existing
bank
and
eliminate
that
bank
as
an
independent
competitive
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
we
think
there
is.
we
think
that
the
entire
legislative
history
shows
that
when
congress
incorporated
certain
provisions
in
certain
--
incorporated
some
portions
of
state
law
in
section
36
(c)
all
it
was
concerned
with
was
safeguarding
the
policies
of
those
states
which
wanted
to
limit
branch
banking
because
they
were
concerned
with
certain
evils
that
were
felt
to
flow
from
that
system.
had
congress
meant
to
go
further
and
place
the
national
banks
in
the
state
banks
on
a
par.
well,
we
do
not
think
it
would
have
chosen
the
roundabout
fashion
of
a
statute
like
section
36
(c),
very
complex
in
its
provisions
which
sets
forth
certain
limitations
of
state
law
as
binding
on
the
national
banks.
but
nowhere
states
that
all
limitations
of
state
law
are
binding
upon
the
national
banks
and
this
connection
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
have
-–
we
have
in
our
brief
set
forth
at
length
references
to
the
debates
which
we
believe
show
that
this
incorporation
of
state
law
had
a
rather
limited
purpose
in
protecting
those
states
unlike
utah
which
do
not
want
to
have
an
unlimited
branch
banking
system
and
i
might
just
add
that
throughout
the
national
bank
act,
in
a
number
of
provisions
which
respondent's
brief
in
number
73
and
88
sets
out
at
length,
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
state
law
shall
be
the
measure
of
a
national
bank's
power.
for
example,
a
national
bank
may
not
acquire
a
state
bank
“in
contravention
of
state
law”
that
is
section
214
(c)
of
title
12.
section
36
(c)
is
not
written
along
those
lines.
congress
could
easily
have
said
that
national
banks
shall
not
branch
in
contravention
of
the
state
law
and
it
didn't
do
that
instead
it
set
forth
some
portions
of
state
law
that
it
was
incorporated.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct
and
that
extreme
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
extreme
which
would
have
permitted
the
national
banks
to
branch
irrespective
of
state
law
was
also
rejected
and
we
certainly
agree
that
there
are
some
restrictions
of
state
law
which
bind
the
national
banks
but
we
don't
think
that
all
restrictions
do
and
we
don't
think
that
utah's
restriction
does.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
urged
that
congress
and
the
national
bank
act,
section
36
(c)
did
not
intend
to
incorporate
and
make
applicable
to
the
national
banks
all
restrictions
that
a
state
might
impose
on
branching
by
state
chartered
banks.
the
congressional
purpose
as
shown
by
the
history
and
in
the
language
of
the
section
36
(c)
was
far
more
limited
to
protect
the
policies
of
those
states
which
feared
the
consequences
of
unlimited
branch
banking
and
to
do
so
by
subjecting
the
national
banks
in
a
state
to
state
law
only
insofar
as
the
state
chooses
to
limit
the
scope
and
extent
of
branch
banking.
if
this
is
a
correct
analysis
then
utah's
take
over
restriction
in
suit
here
whereby
a
state
bank
may
branch
anywhere
in
the
state
provided
only
that
it
does
so
by
taking
over
by
purchase
or
merger
an
existing
bank
is
not
binding
upon
the
national
banks
in
the
state.
such
a
restriction
does
not
limit
the
extent
of
branch
banking
in
utah
and
it
does
not
reflect
any
policy
against
unlimited
branch
banking.
if
anything
it
is
designed
to
accelerate
the
expansion
of
large
affluent
banks
throughout
the
state.
it
is
true
as
the
chief
justice
observed
during
the
argument
yesterday
that
there
is
language
in
the
congressional
debates
referring
to
a
goal
of
competitive
equality.
that
language
is
indeed
the
very
heart
of
respondent's
case
and
i
should
therefore
like
briefly
to
summarize
the
reasons
why
in
our
view
competitive
equality
in
its
literal
sense
is
not
the
policy
of
section
36
(c).
in
the
first
place,
the
term
competitive
equality
is
a
rather
vague
one.
and
to
be
given
concrete
meaning,
it
must
be
viewed
in
its
context
in
the
legislative
debates.
the
inequality
that
the
opponents
of
branch
banking
--
that
the
opponents
of
giving
branching
authority
to
the
national
banks
feared
was
that
which
would
result
if
the
national
banks
enjoyed
unlimited
statewide
branching
authority
irrespective
of
limitations
of
state
law.
now
congress
precluded
any
such
drastic
inequality
by
expressly
providing
in
section
36
(c)
as
i
try
to
explain
in
somewhat
greater
detail
yesterday
that
to
the
extent
a
state
chooses
either
to
forbid
or
geographically
to
circumscribe
branch
banking
within
its
state,
the
resulting
pattern
binds
and
limits
the
national
banks
in
the
states
as
well.
this
was
the
equality
that
congress
sought
to
create.
there
was
no
purpose
of
creating
a
perfect
equality
and
furthermore
the
goal
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
we
refer
to
no
specific
language
defining
the
meaning
of
the
term
competitive
equality.
we
rely
upon
the
tone
and
the
mood
of
these
debates
which
extended
as
i
mention
over
ten
years
in
congress
as
making
clear
what
it
was
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
adopted
certain
portions
of
state
law
on
branching
and
made
it
applicable
to
the
national
banks.
there
is
no
evidence
--
there
is
no
persuasive
evidence
in
the
congressional
reports
that
perfect
equality
between
the
state
and
national
bank
systems
of
state
with
respect
to
branching
was
intended
and
furthermore
this
goal
of
perfect
equality
which
the
respondents
placed
before
this
court
is
illusory
because
the
national
bank
system
was
never
meant
to
be
the
mirror
image
of
the
banking
systems
in
the
various
states.
the
dual
banking
structure
which
we
have
in
this
country
presupposes
a
great
diversity
between
the
two
systems
in
terms
of
the
powers
and
the
supervision
and
the
management
of
state
and
national
banks.
for
example
in
the
franklin
national
bank
case
in
347
u.s.
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
new
york
by
statute
forbad
all
commercial
banks
in
the
state
to
advertise
for
savings
account
and
the
court
held
that
limitation
inapplicable
to
the
national
banks
even
though
the
result
was
to
create
a
certain
disparity.
now,
branching
is
not
an
exception
to
this
rule
of
diversity.
even
respondents
do
not
contend
that
a
national
bank
must
apply
to
utah's
banking
commissioner
in
order
to
open
a
new
branch
in
utah
or
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
passing
upon
the
application
of
the
national
bank
to
branch
must
use
the
criteria
which
guide
the
state
banking
commissioner
in
the
performance
of
his
discretionary
functions
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
a
branch.
utah's
bank
commissioner
must
make
a
finding
that
the
establishment
of
a
branch
would
subserve
and
promote
the
public
convenience
and
advantage
and
there
is
no
similar
requirement
upon
the
comptroller
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
limitation
of
sorts
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
limitation
we
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
--
that
is
a
form
of
limitation
but
what
congress
--
what
many
in
congress
feared
was
a
state
bank
--
was
a
national
bank
that
would
spread
itself
throughout
the
state
by
branching,
a
city
bank
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
--
that's
true
and
that
we
say
is
proper
because
utah
has
not
adopted
the
kind
of
restrictive
policy
on
branching
to
which
congress
decided
to
defer.
it
has
not
said
that
we
believe
that
unlimited
statewide
branch
banking
is
an
evil
that
it
conduces
to
these
problems
of
absentee
ownership.
it
looks
with
equanimity
upon
statewide
branching.
that
being
so,
we
think
the
national
banks
may
properly
branch
throughout
the
state
and
that
the
method
of
branching
is
not
the
kind
of
restriction
which
congress
has
adopted.
now,
it's
quite
true
as
you
said,
that
the
result
will
be
some
disparity
in
the
powers
of
state
and
national
banks
and
i
point
out
only
that
the
greatest
disparity
and
one
inherent
in
this
dual
banking
system
is
that
which
results
from
the
different
attitudes
which
banking
authorities
take
towards
their
responsibilities.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
would
--
we
would
suggest
that
this
kind
of
restriction
probably
does
not
find
the
national
banks
simply
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
suggest
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
press
it
with
great
force
here
because
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
that
question
and
we
recognize
that
it
presents
a
more
difficult
problem
because
after
all
the
restriction
you
put
is
one
which
does
limit
and
confine
branch
banking
in
the
state.
it
is
--
it
expresses
some
kind
of
policy
concerned
with
unlimited
branch
banking,
but
where
utah
says
that
we
will
tolerate
unlimited
branch
banking
so
long
as
it
is
effectuated
by
means
of
mergers,
that
is
a
--
that
reflects
a
wholly
different
policy.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
difference
is
that
if
we
read
the
federal
statute,
it
was
not
designed
to
place
the
state
and
national
banks
on
a
plain
and
complete
equality
so
far
as
branching
is
concerned
but
only
to
safeguard
certain
state
policies
and
specifically
the
policies
of
those
states
which
fear
an
unlimited
statewide
branching
pattern
whereby
a
few
large
city
banks
may
be
able
to
dominate
the
entire
state
banking
industry.
if
utah
have
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
so
because
if
a
state
says
that
no
bank
may
have
more
than
one
branch,
it
is
plainly
limiting
the
extent
to
which
branch
banking
can
take
hold
in
the
state
but
if
what
the
state
provides
is
that
you
may
have
as
branches
as
you
want,
anywhere
in
the
state,
so
long
as
you
establish
the
branch
by
purchasing
an
existing
bank,
it
is
not
circumscribing
or
limiting
the
branch
banking
pattern
of
the
state.
it
is
permitting
city
--
large
city
banks
like
the
walker
bank
in
salt
lake
city
to
extend
itself
through
branching,
through
establishing
numerous
branches
all
over
the
state.
and
we
feel
that
once
a
state
makes
that
determination
that
its
banks
shall
be
permitted
to
extend
themselves
by
branching
throughout
the
state
in
any
numbers
that
there
are
no
further
restrictions
upon
the
national
banks
of
the
state.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
the
result
of
this
is
a
certain
disparity
in
the
powers
of
the
state
and
national
banks
of
a
state.
i
suggest
only
that
this
disparity
is
inherent
in
the
system
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
an
exception
to
the
utah
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
and
this
is
just
--
this
is
but
another
indication
that
we
do
not
find
in
utah
law
any
kind
of
policy
of
restricting
branching
as
such.
there
is
a
policy
here
of
protecting
existing
banks
from
too
much
competition
in
the
form
of
branching.
that
is
the
real
policy
and
it
is
not
the
kind
of
policy
that
to
which
we
believe
congress
meant
to
defer.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
now
that
mr.
justice
clark
is
a
second
exception
in
cities
of
the
first
class
and
in
unincorporated
areas
of
counties
where
such
cities
are
located.
branching
may
be
done
by
state
banks
without
any
limitation.
they
need
not
take
over
an
existing
bank.
it
so
happens
that
salt
lake
city
is
at
the
present
time
the
only
first
class
city.
there,
branching
is
completely
unlimited
as
it
is
in
those
cities
which
have
no
branch
main
offices.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
any
true
--
in
any
city
or
town
where
there
is
at
least
one
main
office
of
a
bank.
even
if
it's
the
bank
that
wants
to
establish
the
branch
that
has
the
only
main
office,
it
is
subject
to
a
limitation.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
--
that
applies
to
all
cities
and
counties
except
salt
lake
city.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
would
think
so
and
bearing
in
mind
that
this
was
a
depression
measure,
this
utah
law
passed
in
1933,
i
suppose
the
feeling
was
that
if
banks
were
free
to
establish
branches
by
opening
new
facilities
and
putting
a
new
competitive
factor
into
the
community
that
might
be
too
much
competition
where
if
it
just
takes
over
an
existing
bank
there's
no
change.
all
we
say
is
that
this
kind
of
policy
was
not
on
the
contemplation
of
congress
when
it
adopted
certain
portions
of
state
law
and
made
them
applicable
to
the
national
banks.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
do
i
have
a
moment
or
--?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
fine.
i'd
like
to
make
just
one
comment.
mr.
bell
made
reference
to
the
first
security
bank
of
utah,
the
largest
bank
in
the
state,
a
national
bank
which
he
said
has
45
branches
in
34
cities
of
utah
and
of
course
the
walker
bank
has
14
branches
throughout
the
state
of
utah
and
how
is
such
an
extensive
branching
pattern
of
these
major
banks
consistent
with
the
view
that
utah's
policy
is
to
restrict
and
to
limit
the
growth
of
branch
banking.
this
is
not
a
state
like
illinois
which
has
decided
to
forbid
branching.
it's
not
a
state
like
pennsylvania
which
has
decided
to
confine
branch
banking
within
a
few
communities.
now,
should
the
court
uphold
the
comptroller's
position
and
hold
that
it
is
permissible
for
national
banks
in
the
state
of
utah
to
establish
de
novo
branches,
it
does
not
follow
that
utah
will
be
unable
to
effectuate
a
policy
of
restricting
branch
banking
in
the
state.
should
it
choose
as
section
36
(c)
expressly
contemplates
to
place
any
kind
of
geographical
bounds
upon
branch
banking,
to
confine
it
to
the
major
cities,
to
confine
it
within
certain
radius
of
home
banking
offices,
if
it
wishes
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
situation
whereby
the
major
banks
in
the
states
have
branched
extensively
throughout
it,
it
has
ample
power
under
the
national
bank
act
to
do
so.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
need
to
imply
in
section
36
(c)
an
additional
power
that
a
state
may
impose
upon
the
national
banks
all
restrictions
or
provisions
of
state
law
hampering
these
national
banks
in
the
performance
of
their
important
federal
functions
even
though
congress
when
it
limited
the
powers
of
national
banks
to
branch
in
section
36
(c)
was
concerned
only
so
far
as
the
history
shows
with
permitting
certain
state
policies
of
confined
branch
banking
to
be
effectuated,
policies
which
so
far
utah
has
not
seen
fit
to
apply
to
its
own
banks.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
under
section
36
(c)
has
power
to
approve
or
disapprove
branch
banking
under
no
specific
criteria.
that
is
to
say
if
a
comptroller
should
adopt
the
attitude
that
branch
banking
is
a
bad
thing
and
should
not
be
allowed,
he
has
a
virtually
unreviewable
discretion
to
refuse
branching
authority
to
national
banks.
i
can
only
assume
that
the
predecessors
of
mr.
saxon
took
a
conservative
view
on
the
propriety
or
the
social
benefits
of
branch
banking
and
we're
not
--
had
no
particular
concern
with
encouraging
banks
to
branch
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
comptrollers
prior
to
the
present
incumbent
had
in
--
had
adverted
to
these
provisions
of
section
36
(c)
and
as
interpretation
of
those
sections
had
deliberately
ruled
that
all
state
provisions
of
--
are
applicable
to
national
banks
so
far
as
i
know
national
banks
in
this
era
or
perhaps
because
of
the
restrictive
attitude
of
the
comptrollers
had
not
sought
the
kind
of
branching
authority
which
the
first
national
bank
of
logan
and
other
banks
encouraged
by
the
present
comptroller
have
sought.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
mean
to
say
that
the
comptroller
has
a
broad
discretion
quite
apart
from
any
specific
provision
of
state
law
as
to
whether
he
shall
permit
a
national
bank
to
establish
a
branch.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
can't
speak
authoritatively
of
what
past
comptrollers
thought
but
i
do
know
that
the
present
comptroller
believes
that
branching
should
be
encouraged
as
a
method
of
injecting
competition
into
local
branching
markets.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
so
far
as
i
understand,
that
is
true.
my
--
the
point
i
mean
to
make
is,
this
is
not
a
case
where
earlier
administrators
had
construed
section
36
(c)
as
preventing
this
kind
of
branching
and
then
mr.
saxon
came
along
and
reversed.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
assume
that
the
issue
did
not
arise
under
these
previous
administrations.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
my
opinion
and
this
comptroller
has
wanted
to
test
the
limits
of
the
law
in
this
area.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
bank
act
in
12
u.s.c.
36
(c)
(1)
empowers
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
authorize
a
national
bank
to
establish
branches
within
its
home
municipality
if
such
establishment
is
permitted
to
the
state
banks
of
the
state
under
state
law.
utah's
banking
code
permits
its
state
charter
banks
to
establish
branches
within
the
bank's
home
municipality
and
indeed
anywhere
in
the
state.
but
it
provides
with
exceptions
that
are
not
relevant
here
that
a
branch
maybe
established
only
by
taking
over
by
purchase
or
merger
at
existing
bank.
and
the
sole
issue
in
this
three
consolidated
cases
is
whether
this
take
over
restriction
of
utah
law
is
binding
upon
the
national
banks
located
in
utah.

a

where
at

arose,

had

contending
that
the
take
over
restriction
of
utah
law
finds
the
national
banks
in
that
state.
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
this
challenge
to
the
comptroller
on
the
authority
of
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
the
logan
case.
we
believe
that
the
courts
below
were
an
error
in
holding
utah's
take
over
restriction
applicable
to
the
national
banks
and
i
propose
to
demonstrate
this
first
by
reviewing
the
history
of
section
36
(c)
of
the
banking
title
and
then
considering
the
language
and
design
of
the
federal
statute
of
section
36
(c)
in
the
light
of
this
critical
history.
now,
in
the
beginning,
the
national
banks
had
no
authority
to
establish
branches.
and
each
national
bank
was
limited
to
a
single
office.
this
created
no
problems
in
an
era
when
branch
banking
was
virtually
unheard
of
but
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
the
states
begin
increasingly
to
experiment
with
permitting
their
state
charter
banks
to
establish
branches.
and
this
development
lead
to
proposals
in
congress
beginning
in
the
early
1920's
to
give
the
national
banks
authority
to
establish
branches.
and
in
the
deliberations
on
these
proposals,
it
soon
became
evident
that
were
two
quite
antagonistic
schools
of
thought
on
the
subject
of
branch
banking.
one
school
believes
that
it
was
a
salutary
development
that
it
would
strengthen
the
banking
system
and
would
inject
greater
competition
into
it.
and
the
congressmen
who
held
this
view
proposed
that
the
national
banks
be
permitted
irrespective
of
state
law
to
establish
branches
throughout
the
state
in
which
they
were
located
and
even
to
a
limited
extent
in
other
states.
the
other
school
of
thought
held
that
branch
banking
was
an
evil.
and
the
reasons
they
gave
for
these
are
relevant
and
can
be
summarized
very
briefly.
they
were
concerned
with
the
absentee
ownership
of
a
community's
banking
facilities
with
the
problem
that
a
farmer
or
a
merchant
in
a
small
town
might
have
to
deal
with
a
bank
not
rooted
in
the
community.
a
manager
from
a
financial
corporation
located
elsewhere.
they
feared
also
urban
domination
by
affluent
city
banks
of
the
world
banking
markets
of
a
state.
and
finally
they
appeared
that
branch
banking
was
conducive
to
the
monopolization
of
a
state's
banking
industry
by
a
few
large
banks.
banks
which
would
spread
out
throughout
the
state
in
a
kind
of
tentacular
fashion
would
drive
out
the
smaller
independent
banks
throughout
the
state
and
lead
to
a
high
concentration
and
centralization
of
a
state
banking
industry.
and
this
congressional
group
thought
that
the
national
banks
should
remain
without
any
authority
to
branch.
now
in
the
states,
opinion
was
divided
on
this
controversy
between
the
two
schools
of
thought
on
branch
banking.
some
states
forebad
branch
banking
altogether.
others
permitted
it
but
within
very
narrow
circumscribe
bounds.
and
others
permitted
it
with
very
few
restrictions
and
this
division
in
the
states
was
reflected
in
the
bitter
and
protracted
debates
in
congress
stretching
over
a
decade
in
the
1920's
and
1930's
and
culminating
in
the
branch
banking
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
which
are
now
codified
in
section
36
(c).
in
the
end
of
course,
the
proponents
of
allowing
the
national
banks
to
have
branches
prevail,
but
not
without
a
compromise
with
the
opponents.
the
congressional
group
for
which
--
for
whom
branch
banking
was
an
anathema
was
simply
too
vocal
and
too
strong
to
be
completely
overwritten.
and
in
the
end
it
had
to
be
accommodated.
and
i
should
now
like
to
trace
the
terms
of
this
accommodation
between
the
proponents
and
opponents
of
branch
banking
in
the
actual
language
of
section
36
(c)
which
we
have
set
forth
on
pages
44
to
45
of
our
brief.
subsection
1,
which
is
the
provision
directly
relevant
here
provides
that
within
it's
home
municipality,
a
national
bank
with
a
comptrollers
permission
may
establish
branches
if
such
establishment
is
permitted
to
stay
chartered
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
national
bank
is
located.
and
the
congressional
purpose
here
is
plain,
if
a
state
so
completely
distrusts
the
institution
and
practice
of
branch
banking
as
to
forbid
it
all
together
even
within
a
bank's
home
town,
the
national
banks
located
in
the
state
are
likewise
forbidden
to
have
any
branches.
consider
now
subsection
2,
it
provides
that
the
comptroller
may
authorize
a
national
bank
to
establish
branches
outside
of
the
bank's
home
municipality
although
not
outside
of
the
state
upon
two
conditions.
first,
that
state
banks
enjoy
a
like
authority
to
establish
branches
outside
of
their
hometowns
and
secondly
subject
to
such
restrictions
as
to
location
which
the
state
may
impose
on
its
state
chartered
banks.
now,
a
state
might
look
with
relative
equanimity
upon
branching
with
inter-bank's
hometown
feeling
that
the
dangers
of
absentee
ownership
--
supposed
dangerous
of
absentee
ownership
and
monopolization
where
very
much
mitigated
where
branching
authority
is
limited
to
the
hometown
and
yet
decide
that
a
broader
authority
would
be
dangerous.
and
if
that
is
the
state's
decision
then
the
national
banks
are
likewise
limited
to
their
hometowns.
and
congress
refined
the
matter
still
further
by
providing
an
intermediate
position
between
hometown
branching
and
state
wide
branching.
there
are
some
states
like
pennsylvania
which
apparently
are
distrustful
of
statewide
branching
and
yet
feel
that
banks
should
be
able
to
follow
its
customers
to
the
suburbs
for
example.
and
so
provides
that
a
bank
may
establish
a
branch
within
its
home
county
and
also
within
contiguous
counties.
and
there
are
other
states
which
permit
branching
outside
of
the
hometown
within
a
given
mile
radius
within
25
or
100
miles.
and
so
the
state
should
decide
to
circumscribe
its
branch
banking
system
in
that
fashion,
the
national
banks
are
likewise
are
bound.
and
what
is
adds
up
to
is
that
if
the
state
–-
if
a
state
wants
to
create
a
limited
branch
banking
system,
if
it
wants
to
avert
or
at
least
contain
these
dangers
that
opponents
of
branch
banking
foresee
that
may
do
so
in
confidence
that
the
national
banks
located
in
the
state
cannot
subvert
its
policy
by
virtue
of
enjoying
a
broader
branching
authority.
and
so
if
the
state
of
utah
had
provided
that
its
banks
may
not
establish
branches
outside
of
their
home
municipality
or
outside
of
their
home
municipality
plus
adjacent
counties
or
beyond
a
certain
radius
of
the
bank's
home
office
and
such
a
policy
of
containing
branch
banking
would
bind
the
national
banks
in
the
state
no
less
than
if
utah
had
forbade
branch
banking
altogether.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
branches
would
not
be
within
the
expressed
language
of
the
–-
of
section
of
36
(c)
and
probably
is
not
a
necessary
implication
from
that
language
simply
because
a
state
can
place
limits
upon
its
branching
system
to
avert
these
dangers
of
centralization.
perhaps
most
effectively
by
setting
geographical
bounds
rather
than
by
saying
that
a
bank
may
have
15
branches
or
ten
branches
or
something
like
that.
we
do
recognize
that
that
would
present
a
more
difficult
question
in
the
restriction
in
issue
here
because
as
i
shall
try
to
suggest
now,
the
type
of
restriction
that
utah
has
imposed,
it
reflects
no
policy
of
limiting
a
state
branch
bank
system.
for
example
we
have
in
number
51,
as
the
respondent,
a
state
bank
which
has
14
branches
for
all
that
appears
well
distributed
throughout
the
state.
for
under
utah
law,
a
bank
may
establish
new
branches
both
within
its
home
municipality
and
anywhere
throughout
the
state.
we
have
for
example
as
petitioner,
number
73,
the
first
security
bank
of
utah,
a
bank
having
43
branches
in
34
cities
and
while
it's
true
that
this
is
a
national
bank,
had
utah
chosen
to
circumscribe
or
forbid
branch
banking
in
its
state,
national
banks
would
enjoy
no
greater
authority.
the
fact
is
that
all
utah
has
required
in
this
take
over
restriction
which
is
the
issue
here
is
that
all
branching
be
channeled
into
mergers.
and
this
is
a
restriction
wholly
unrelated
to
the
kind
of
concerns
which
cause
congress
in
section
36
(c)
to
permit
the
states
to
limit
the
branch
banking
systems
of
their
states.
there
is
nothing
in
utah
law
to
prevent
a
large
city
bank
like
walker
bank
which
is
a
salt
lake
city
bank
from
establishing
branches
all
over
the
state,
in
any
number
anywhere,
simply
by
purchasing
existing
banks.
and
in
fact
we
think
that
a
system
which
--
without
limiting
branching
directs
it
exclusively
into
the
merger
route,
promotes
the
very
centralization
and
monopolization
tendencies
with
which
congress
was
concerned
in
incorporating
some
portions
of
state
law
because
every
time
a
state
bank
of
utah
decides
to
open
a
branch,
it
must
take
over
an
existing
bank
and
eliminate
that
bank
as
an
independent
competitive
factor.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
we
think
there
is.
we
think
that
the
entire
legislative
history
shows
that
when
congress
incorporated
certain
provisions
in
certain
--
incorporated
some
portions
of
state
law
in
section
36
(c)
all
it
was
concerned
with
was
safeguarding
the
policies
of
those
states
which
wanted
to
limit
branch
banking
because
they
were
concerned
with
certain
evils
that
were
felt
to
flow
from
that
system.
had
congress
meant
to
go
further
and
place
the
national
banks
in
the
state
banks
on
a
par.
well,
we
do
not
think
it
would
have
chosen
the
roundabout
fashion
of
a
statute
like
section
36
(c),
very
complex
in
its
provisions
which
sets
forth
certain
limitations
of
state
law
as
binding
on
the
national
banks.
but
nowhere
states
that
all
limitations
of
state
law
are
binding
upon
the
national
banks
and
this
connection
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
have
-–
we
have
in
our
brief
set
forth
at
length
references
to
the
debates
which
we
believe
show
that
this
incorporation
of
state
law
had
a
rather
limited
purpose
in
protecting
those
states
unlike
utah
which
do
not
want
to
have
an
unlimited
branch
banking
system
and
i
might
just
add
that
throughout
the
national
bank
act,
in
a
number
of
provisions
which
respondent's
brief
in
number
73
and
88
sets
out
at
length,
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
state
law
shall
be
the
measure
of
a
national
bank's
power.
for
example,
a
national
bank
may
not
acquire
a
state
bank
“in
contravention
of
state
law”
that
is
section
214
(c)
of
title
12.
section
36
(c)
is
not
written
along
those
lines.
congress
could
easily
have
said
that
national
banks
shall
not
branch
in
contravention
of
the
state
law
and
it
didn't
do
that
instead
it
set
forth
some
portions
of
state
law
that
it
was
incorporated.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct
and
that
extreme
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
extreme
which
would
have
permitted
the
national
banks
to
branch
irrespective
of
state
law
was
also
rejected
and
we
certainly
agree
that
there
are
some
restrictions
of
state
law
which
bind
the
national
banks
but
we
don't
think
that
all
restrictions
do
and
we
don't
think
that
utah's
restriction
does.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
urged
that
congress
and
the
national
bank
act,
section
36
(c)
did
not
intend
to
incorporate
and
make
applicable
to
the
national
banks
all
restrictions
that
a
state
might
impose
on
branching
by
state
chartered
banks.
the
congressional
purpose
as
shown
by
the
history
and
in
the
language
of
the
section
36
(c)
was
far
more
limited
to
protect
the
policies
of
those
states
which
feared
the
consequences
of
unlimited
branch
banking
and
to
do
so
by
subjecting
the
national
banks
in
a
state
to
state
law
only
insofar
as
the
state
chooses
to
limit
the
scope
and
extent
of
branch
banking.
if
this
is
a
correct
analysis
then
utah's
take
over
restriction
in
suit
here
whereby
a
state
bank
may
branch
anywhere
in
the
state
provided
only
that
it
does
so
by
taking
over
by
purchase
or
merger
an
existing
bank
is
not
binding
upon
the
national
banks
in
the
state.
such
a
restriction
does
not
limit
the
extent
of
branch
banking
in
utah
and
it
does
not
reflect
any
policy
against
unlimited
branch
banking.
if
anything
it
is
designed
to
accelerate
the
expansion
of
large
affluent
banks
throughout
the
state.
it
is
true
as
the
chief
justice
observed
during
the
argument
yesterday
that
there
is
language
in
the
congressional
debates
referring
to
a
goal
of
competitive
equality.
that
language
is
indeed
the
very
heart
of
respondent's
case
and
i
should
therefore
like
briefly
to
summarize
the
reasons
why
in
our
view
competitive
equality
in
its
literal
sense
is
not
the
policy
of
section
36
(c).
in
the
first
place,
the
term
competitive
equality
is
a
rather
vague
one.
and
to
be
given
concrete
meaning,
it
must
be
viewed
in
its
context
in
the
legislative
debates.
the
inequality
that
the
opponents
of
branch
banking
--
that
the
opponents
of
giving
branching
authority
to
the
national
banks
feared
was
that
which
would
result
if
the
national
banks
enjoyed
unlimited
statewide
branching
authority
irrespective
of
limitations
of
state
law.
now
congress
precluded
any
such
drastic
inequality
by
expressly
providing
in
section
36
(c)
as
i
try
to
explain
in
somewhat
greater
detail
yesterday
that
to
the
extent
a
state
chooses
either
to
forbid
or
geographically
to
circumscribe
branch
banking
within
its
state,
the
resulting
pattern
binds
and
limits
the
national
banks
in
the
states
as
well.
this
was
the
equality
that
congress
sought
to
create.
there
was
no
purpose
of
creating
a
perfect
equality
and
furthermore
the
goal
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
we
refer
to
no
specific
language
defining
the
meaning
of
the
term
competitive
equality.
we
rely
upon
the
tone
and
the
mood
of
these
debates
which
extended
as
i
mention
over
ten
years
in
congress
as
making
clear
what
it
was
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
adopted
certain
portions
of
state
law
on
branching
and
made
it
applicable
to
the
national
banks.
there
is
no
evidence
--
there
is
no
persuasive
evidence
in
the
congressional
reports
that
perfect
equality
between
the
state
and
national
bank
systems
of
state
with
respect
to
branching
was
intended
and
furthermore
this
goal
of
perfect
equality
which
the
respondents
placed
before
this
court
is
illusory
because
the
national
bank
system
was
never
meant
to
be
the
mirror
image
of
the
banking
systems
in
the
various
states.
the
dual
banking
structure
which
we
have
in
this
country
presupposes
a
great
diversity
between
the
two
systems
in
terms
of
the
powers
and
the
supervision
and
the
management
of
state
and
national
banks.
for
example
in
the
franklin
national
bank
case
in
347
u.s.
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
new
york
by
statute
forbad
all
commercial
banks
in
the
state
to
advertise
for
savings
account
and
the
court
held
that
limitation
inapplicable
to
the
national
banks
even
though
the
result
was
to
create
a
certain
disparity.
now,
branching
is
not
an
exception
to
this
rule
of
diversity.
even
respondents
do
not
contend
that
a
national
bank
must
apply
to
utah's
banking
commissioner
in
order
to
open
a
new
branch
in
utah
or
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
passing
upon
the
application
of
the
national
bank
to
branch
must
use
the
criteria
which
guide
the
state
banking
commissioner
in
the
performance
of
his
discretionary
functions
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
a
branch.
utah's
bank
commissioner
must
make
a
finding
that
the
establishment
of
a
branch
would
subserve
and
promote
the
public
convenience
and
advantage
and
there
is
no
similar
requirement
upon
the
comptroller
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
limitation
of
sorts
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
limitation
we
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
--
that
is
a
form
of
limitation
but
what
congress
--
what
many
in
congress
feared
was
a
state
bank
--
was
a
national
bank
that
would
spread
itself
throughout
the
state
by
branching,
a
city
bank
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
--
that's
true
and
that
we
say
is
proper
because
utah
has
not
adopted
the
kind
of
restrictive
policy
on
branching
to
which
congress
decided
to
defer.
it
has
not
said
that
we
believe
that
unlimited
statewide
branch
banking
is
an
evil
that
it
conduces
to
these
problems
of
absentee
ownership.
it
looks
with
equanimity
upon
statewide
branching.
that
being
so,
we
think
the
national
banks
may
properly
branch
throughout
the
state
and
that
the
method
of
branching
is
not
the
kind
of
restriction
which
congress
has
adopted.
now,
it's
quite
true
as
you
said,
that
the
result
will
be
some
disparity
in
the
powers
of
state
and
national
banks
and
i
point
out
only
that
the
greatest
disparity
and
one
inherent
in
this
dual
banking
system
is
that
which
results
from
the
different
attitudes
which
banking
authorities
take
towards
their
responsibilities.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
would
--
we
would
suggest
that
this
kind
of
restriction
probably
does
not
find
the
national
banks
simply
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
suggest
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
press
it
with
great
force
here
because
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
that
question
and
we
recognize
that
it
presents
a
more
difficult
problem
because
after
all
the
restriction
you
put
is
one
which
does
limit
and
confine
branch
banking
in
the
state.
it
is
--
it
expresses
some
kind
of
policy
concerned
with
unlimited
branch
banking,
but
where
utah
says
that
we
will
tolerate
unlimited
branch
banking
so
long
as
it
is
effectuated
by
means
of
mergers,
that
is
a
--
that
reflects
a
wholly
different
policy.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
difference
is
that
if
we
read
the
federal
statute,
it
was
not
designed
to
place
the
state
and
national
banks
on
a
plain
and
complete
equality
so
far
as
branching
is
concerned
but
only
to
safeguard
certain
state
policies
and
specifically
the
policies
of
those
states
which
fear
an
unlimited
statewide
branching
pattern
whereby
a
few
large
city
banks
may
be
able
to
dominate
the
entire
state
banking
industry.
if
utah
have
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
so
because
if
a
state
says
that
no
bank
may
have
more
than
one
branch,
it
is
plainly
limiting
the
extent
to
which
branch
banking
can
take
hold
in
the
state
but
if
what
the
state
provides
is
that
you
may
have
as
branches
as
you
want,
anywhere
in
the
state,
so
long
as
you
establish
the
branch
by
purchasing
an
existing
bank,
it
is
not
circumscribing
or
limiting
the
branch
banking
pattern
of
the
state.
it
is
permitting
city
--
large
city
banks
like
the
walker
bank
in
salt
lake
city
to
extend
itself
through
branching,
through
establishing
numerous
branches
all
over
the
state.
and
we
feel
that
once
a
state
makes
that
determination
that
its
banks
shall
be
permitted
to
extend
themselves
by
branching
throughout
the
state
in
any
numbers
that
there
are
no
further
restrictions
upon
the
national
banks
of
the
state.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
the
result
of
this
is
a
certain
disparity
in
the
powers
of
the
state
and
national
banks
of
a
state.
i
suggest
only
that
this
disparity
is
inherent
in
the
system
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
an
exception
to
the
utah
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
and
this
is
just
--
this
is
but
another
indication
that
we
do
not
find
in
utah
law
any
kind
of
policy
of
restricting
branching
as
such.
there
is
a
policy
here
of
protecting
existing
banks
from
too
much
competition
in
the
form
of
branching.
that
is
the
real
policy
and
it
is
not
the
kind
of
policy
that
to
which
we
believe
congress
meant
to
defer.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
now
that
mr.
justice
clark
is
a
second
exception
in
cities
of
the
first
class
and
in
unincorporated
areas
of
counties
where
such
cities
are
located.
branching
may
be
done
by
state
banks
without
any
limitation.
they
need
not
take
over
an
existing
bank.
it
so
happens
that
salt
lake
city
is
at
the
present
time
the
only
first
class
city.
there,
branching
is
completely
unlimited
as
it
is
in
those
cities
which
have
no
branch
main
offices.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
any
true
--
in
any
city
or
town
where
there
is
at
least
one
main
office
of
a
bank.
even
if
it's
the
bank
that
wants
to
establish
the
branch
that
has
the
only
main
office,
it
is
subject
to
a
limitation.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
--
that
applies
to
all
cities
and
counties
except
salt
lake
city.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
would
think
so
and
bearing
in
mind
that
this
was
a
depression
measure,
this
utah
law
passed
in
1933,
i
suppose
the
feeling
was
that
if
banks
were
free
to
establish
branches
by
opening
new
facilities
and
putting
a
new
competitive
factor
into
the
community
that
might
be
too
much
competition
where
if
it
just
takes
over
an
existing
bank
there's
no
change.
all
we
say
is
that
this
kind
of
policy
was
not
on
the
contemplation
of
congress
when
it
adopted
certain
portions
of
state
law
and
made
them
applicable
to
the
national
banks.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
do
i
have
a
moment
or
--?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
fine.
i'd
like
to
make
just
one
comment.
mr.
bell
made
reference
to
the
first
security
bank
of
utah,
the
largest
bank
in
the
state,
a
national
bank
which
he
said
has
45
branches
in
34
cities
of
utah
and
of
course
the
walker
bank
has
14
branches
throughout
the
state
of
utah
and
how
is
such
an
extensive
branching
pattern
of
these
major
banks
consistent
with
the
view
that
utah's
policy
is
to
restrict
and
to
limit
the
growth
of
branch
banking.
this
is
not
a
state
like
illinois
which
has
decided
to
forbid
branching.
it's
not
a
state
like
pennsylvania
which
has
decided
to
confine
branch
banking
within
a
few
communities.
now,
should
the
court
uphold
the
comptroller's
position
and
hold
that
it
is
permissible
for
national
banks
in
the
state
of
utah
to
establish
de
novo
branches,
it
does
not
follow
that
utah
will
be
unable
to
effectuate
a
policy
of
restricting
branch
banking
in
the
state.
should
it
choose
as
section
36
(c)
expressly
contemplates
to
place
any
kind
of
geographical
bounds
upon
branch
banking,
to
confine
it
to
the
major
cities,
to
confine
it
within
certain
radius
of
home
banking
offices,
if
it
wishes
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
situation
whereby
the
major
banks
in
the
states
have
branched
extensively
throughout
it,
it
has
ample
power
under
the
national
bank
act
to
do
so.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
need
to
imply
in
section
36
(c)
an
additional
power
that
a
state
may
impose
upon
the
national
banks
all
restrictions
or
provisions
of
state
law
hampering
these
national
banks
in
the
performance
of
their
important
federal
functions
even
though
congress
when
it
limited
the
powers
of
national
banks
to
branch
in
section
36
(c)
was
concerned
only
so
far
as
the
history
shows
with
permitting
certain
state
policies
of
confined
branch
banking
to
be
effectuated,
policies
which
so
far
utah
has
not
seen
fit
to
apply
to
its
own
banks.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
under
section
36
(c)
has
power
to
approve
or
disapprove
branch
banking
under
no
specific
criteria.
that
is
to
say
if
a
comptroller
should
adopt
the
attitude
that
branch
banking
is
a
bad
thing
and
should
not
be
allowed,
he
has
a
virtually
unreviewable
discretion
to
refuse
branching
authority
to
national
banks.
i
can
only
assume
that
the
predecessors
of
mr.
saxon
took
a
conservative
view
on
the
propriety
or
the
social
benefits
of
branch
banking
and
we're
not
--
had
no
particular
concern
with
encouraging
banks
to
branch
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
comptrollers
prior
to
the
present
incumbent
had
in
--
had
adverted
to
these
provisions
of
section
36
(c)
and
as
interpretation
of
those
sections
had
deliberately
ruled
that
all
state
provisions
of
--
are
applicable
to
national
banks
so
far
as
i
know
national
banks
in
this
era
or
perhaps
because
of
the
restrictive
attitude
of
the
comptrollers
had
not
sought
the
kind
of
branching
authority
which
the
first
national
bank
of
logan
and
other
banks
encouraged
by
the
present
comptroller
have
sought.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
mean
to
say
that
the
comptroller
has
a
broad
discretion
quite
apart
from
any
specific
provision
of
state
law
as
to
whether
he
shall
permit
a
national
bank
to
establish
a
branch.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
can't
speak
authoritatively
of
what
past
comptrollers
thought
but
i
do
know
that
the
present
comptroller
believes
that
branching
should
be
encouraged
as
a
method
of
injecting
competition
into
local
branching
markets.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
so
far
as
i
understand,
that
is
true.
my
--
the
point
i
mean
to
make
is,
this
is
not
a
case
where
earlier
administrators
had
construed
section
36
(c)
as
preventing
this
kind
of
branching
and
then
mr.
saxon
came
along
and
reversed.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
assume
that
the
issue
did
not
arise
under
these
previous
administrations.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
my
opinion
and
this
comptroller
has
wanted
to
test
the
limits
of
the
law
in
this
area.
