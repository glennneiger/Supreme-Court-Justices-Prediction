justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
posner,
i
take
it
the
number
of
the
existing
banks
is
a
limitation,
isn't
it,
on
branching
in
and
of
itself
under
the
utah
statute?
that
is
there
may
not
be
more
branches
than
are
existing
banks
because
we
can't
establish
a
branch
without
acquiring
an
existing
branch,
isn't
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
why
isn't
that
itself
a
state
policy
of
limitation
on
a
number
of
branching?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
if
--
are
they
--
there
are
more
familiar
limitation
as
i
recall
it
is
that
you
may
not
have
branches
except
in
a
municipality
or
a
countywide
limitation
or
that
sort
of
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
this
may
be
a
different
form
because
i
gather
branching
may
be
statewide
in
utah
under
utah's
statute
but
limited
to
the
number
of
existing
banks
at
the
time
that
the
bank
which
wants
the
branch
wants
to
acquire
one
branch,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
utah
limitation
though,
if
you
prevail,
isn't
that
precisely
that
can
--
what
can
happen
in
utah?
in
other
words,
--
in
other
words,
national
banks
may
branch
by
establishing
new
locations,
may
they
not,
if
you're
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
mr.
posner.
i
was
thinking
now
only
about
state
banks,
suppose
you
have
a
community,
would
you
have
no
principal
office
or
a
state
bank,
but
you
do
have
branch
offices
of
some
state
banks.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
other
state
banks
go
into
that
community
and
establish
branches
although
there
are
no
principal
offices
that
they
can
acquire?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
may?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
kind
allows
unlimited
branching
then
does
it
subject
of
course
to
the
discussion
of
the
state
banking
commissioner?
unlimited
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
branching
by
state
banks
in
any
community
where
there
exist
only
branch
banks.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
it
really
comes
down
to
this
does
it
that
state
banks
may
branch
without
restriction
sort
of
the
approval
of
a
state
commission
in
all
communities
of
utah
except
those
where
there
are
principal
offices
of
banks
located
and
in
those
instances
they
may
branch,
say
for
salt
lake
city
wholly
by
acquisition
of
the
principal
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
salt
lake
city,
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
correct.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
bell,
if
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
sir.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
situation
where
there
are
only
branches,
i
gather
that
a
national
bank
may
establish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
at
the
time
you
--
and
also
this
federal
statute
came
on
the
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
include
new
york
and
massachusetts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
waste
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
jones,
are
you
reading
from
736?
justice
william
j.

jr.
thank
you.
