justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
governing
provision
of
the
federal
law
is
36
(c)
(1),
isn't
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
your
case?
in
36
(c)
(1),
permits
a
national
bank
to
establish
and
operate
a
new
branch
within
the
limits
of
the
city
in
which
it's
located.
if
such
an
establishment
in
operation
or
at
the
time
expressly
authorized
to
state
banks
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
question,
now
literally
i
suppose
that
the
opponents
argued
that
since
a
state
bank
could
not
establish
nor
operate
a
branch
in
logan
then
the
national
--
you
as
a
national
bank
could
not
do
so.
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
ought
to
as
i
believe
mr.
posner
did
that
we
ought
to
read
into
that
certain
qualifications
and
put
a
gloss
on
it
based
on
the
intent
of
congress.
justice
abe
fortas
but
walter
did
it
by
merger?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
doing
this
by
merger.
you're
doing
it
under
--
in
circumstances
when
a
state
bank
could
not
do
so,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wilson,
if
the
position
for
which
you
and
the
other
counsel
who
have
argued
here
thus
far
contend
or
adopted,
would
you
expect
the
state
to
amend
the
law
so
far
as
state
banks
are
concern?
that
is
to
say
if
in
a
--
let's
--
supposedly
expanding
community,
the
national
banks
were
free
to
establish
branches
anywhere
they
wanted
to,
would
you
not
expect
that
the
state
would
in
order
to
maintain
the
competitive
position
of
the
state
banks
proceed
to
amend
the
law
so
that
the
state
banks
would
have
the
similar
privilege.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
would
in
effect
which
we
really
have
here
is
the
question
as
to
whether
it
seems
to
me
is
a
question
as
to
whether
congress
intended
that
net
--
the
state
policies
with
respect
to
branch
banking
or
a
national
policy
with
respect
to
branch
banking
would
provide
it.
