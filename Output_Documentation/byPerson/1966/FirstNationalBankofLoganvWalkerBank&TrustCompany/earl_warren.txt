chief

earl

well,
wasn't
the
real
purpose
of
this
act
of
congress
to
put
the
national
banks
on
exactly
the
same
footing
as
the
state
banks
in
branch
banking
so
that
neither
would
have
a
preference
over
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
detract
from
that
view?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
--
is
there
any
language
in
the
committee
reports
of
either
house
or
in
the
debates
on
the
floor
that
you
reflect
that
statement?
can
you
point
to
anything
that
will
enlighten
us
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
--
you
could
easily
have
said
that
if
the
–-
if
a
state
laws
authorized
branch
banking
of
any
kind
that
the
federal
government
–-
the
national
banks
were
entitled
to
go
in
on
any
terms
of
control
of
that
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

they
didn't
say
that,
did
they?
chief

we'll
recess,

your

up.

mr.
posner,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
what's
the
specific
language
in
any
of
the
committee
documents
or
debate
on
the
floor
bears
you
out
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
mr.
posner,
suppose
the
state
of
utah
said
that
in
cities
of
20,000
like
this
city
was
that
banks
could
have
one
but
no
more
than
one
branch
in
such
cities,
would
the
national
banks
and
the
authorized
have
as
many
branches
they
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
suggest
--
do
you
argue
that
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
is
--
the
answer
is
no,
that
it
would
not
be
a
restriction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
utah
has
the
right
to
determine
how
many
banks
shall
be
in
any
community,
i
take
it,
than
it
probably
has
on
that
through
its
bank
commissioner.
now,
why
isn't
that
just
as
much
the
limitation
as
the
court
says
only
when
branch
in
one
community?
what
is
the
fundamental
difference
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
any
fundamental
difference
between
those
two
situations
that
i
put
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
perry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
mr.
wilson,
if
the
state
permits
any
kind
of
branching,
then
the
national
banks
can
do
any
kind
of
branching?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
get
to
that
mr.
bell,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
i
understand
you
to
say
that
for
36
years,
the
comptroller
has
never
asserted
the
position
that
is
being
asserted
here?
chief

mr.

chief

warren
thank
you
mr.

mr.
posner.
chief

yes,
i
think
you
do.
chief

mr.

would
you
mind
commenting

the
statement
of

to
the

that
no
comptroller
of
the
currency
prior
to
the
present
one
had
so
interpreted
the
act
and
that
all
of
these
cases
that
you
cite
are
--
in
the

few
years,
would
you
mind
telling

what
your
opinion,
the

of
this

had
been?
