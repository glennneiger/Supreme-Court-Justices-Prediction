mr.
john
wilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
petitioner
in
the
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
this
involves
a
national
bank
in
ogden
which
is
on
all
floors
with
a
problem
confronting
a
national
bank
in
logan
so
that
i
associate
myself
with
the
remarks
which
have
been
made
by
my
colleagues
in
arguing
third
for
the
petitioners
i
have
no
intention
to
repeat
their
arguments.
i
have
sought
to
make
a
contribution
to
this
presented
--
invitation
today
by
analyzing
a
little
different
situation
and
that
is
whether
the
respondents
here
are
contending
for
absolute
equality
or
not.
in
the
lower
court
in
our
case,
my
worthy
opponent
used
the
phrase
“exact
equality.”
he
has
abandoned
that
phrase
as
i
see
--
as
i
read
in
the
brief
in
this
court.
now,
i
realize
of
course
with
respect
to
administrative
functions
of
the
supervisor
of
banks
that
he
is
not
arguing
that
there
must
be
equality
there.
but
he
seems
to
be
arguing
for
absolute
equality
and
if
he
can't
maintain
this
position,
he
must
give
way
in
their
position
that
our
position
is
immeasurably
improved
by
that
weakness.
this
i
think
is
strengthened
by
my
reference
to
a
portion
of
the
utah
branching
statute
which
has
not
been
discussed
before
your
honors
yesterday
or
today
and
which
has
only
marveled
gloss
over
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent.
in
the
branching
section
not
only
is
it
provided
that
branching
shall
be
only
by
taking
over
or
merger,
but
that
the
bank
to
be
taken
over
must
be
in
existence
for
five
years.
now,
all
my
--
all
our
worthy
opponents
on
the
other
side
are
going
to
maintain
that
in
order
to
sustain
their
theory
of
absolute
equality
here
that
that
provision
too
is
imposed
upon
the
federal
government.
let
me
tell
you
why
i
speak
of
this.
we
know
that
in
times
of
financial
crisis,
whether
it
be
in
a
community
or
whether
it
be
in
a
nation
that
a
very
important
function
of
the
federal
comptroller
has
been
--
in
the
case
of
a
failing
national
bank
in
a
community
to
prevent
that
bank
from
closing
its
doors
by
having
a
strong
national
bank
in
the
community
take
over
the
smaller
failing
bank
and
thus
save
a
failure
in
the
community.
now,
my
time
is
short
and
i
would
close
with
a
question
like
this.
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
adopting
the
provisions
which
we
discussed
here
today
intend
that
the
federal
government
in
its
exercise
of
powers
over
federal
instrumentalities
as
national
banks
are,
did
it
intend
that
there
should
be
a
hamstring,
let
me
call
it,
of
the
federal
government
so
that
it
could
not
exercise
this
very
important
function
of
taking
over
a
failing
bank
if
the
failing
bank
in
utah
had
not
been
in
existence
for
five
years.
i
say
that
these
practical
considerations
are
important
for
a
construction
of
the
statute
and
for
an
understanding
of
the
legislative
intent
because
otherwise
we
get
into
and
argument
of
“it
does,
it
doesn't”
and
i
have
sought
for
something
here
that
illustrates
that
the
national
government
which
can
be
supreme
in
this
field
will
be
limited
and
restricted
if
this
five-year
limitation
is
imposed
upon
the
takeover
of
a
bank
in
utah
and
i
would
expect
my
opponents
to
discuss
whether
they
argue
here
today
that
the
five-year
limitation
is
equally
applicable
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
wilson
i
would
expect
them
to
do
that
and
i
would
see
no
vice
in
that
happening.
mr.
john
wilson
except
that
the
national
government
--
the
congress
has
laid
down
certain
absolute
restrictions
such
as
if
a
state
does
not
branch,
the
federal
government
may
not
branch
or
in
section
2
of
36
(c)
that
the
state
may
proscribe
the
location
so
that
these
are
the
--
these
are
the
absolutes
in
the
statute,
otherwise,
i
--
as
i
say
i
associate
myself
with
the
discussions
of
my
brethren,
my
colleagues
who
take
the
position
that
once
the
permission
is
granted
to
branch
this
is
the
extent
of
the
limitation.
mr.
john
wilson
that's
correct
sir.
that's
my
position.
and
i
think
that
when
your
honor
asked
the
question
of
mr.
posner
yesterday,
was
there
any
legislative
--
any
evidence
of
legislative
intent
to
this
effect?
when
one
reads
two
of
36
(c)
and
finds
the
phrase
with
respect
to
branching
outside
of
cities,
it
says,
and
subject
to
the
limitations
as
to
location.
i
think
this
is
as
--
this
is
as
eloquent
as
a
phrase
could
be
used
by
congress
to
show
a
clear
intention
that
when
they
wanted
to
make
a
restriction,
they
employed
the
word
restriction
and
in
two
they
made
claim
that
you
cannot
branch
in
the
outer
portions
of
the
state
without
the
state
approving
the
location.
