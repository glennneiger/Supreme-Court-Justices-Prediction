point,
first
thing
where
the

where
the
appellees
notified
that
the
commission
was
complaint
an
issue
in
an
order
approving

justice

served
on

justice

fortas
on
the

--
justice

in
fact,
so
they
view
that
this
was
from

justice

fortas
when
they
finally
--
justice
abe
fortas
uh-huh.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
and
they
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
they
don't
object

or
they
didn't
object
then
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
initial
order
issued
by
the
commission
from
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
the
face
of
the
case
justice
abe
fortas
this
rate
was
binding
on
the
--
was
applicable
to
the
appellees
as
well
as
to
the
appellant?
justice
abe
fortas
i
hope
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
varying
to
tell
us
what
happen
in
those
nine
years?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
the
commission
or
all
of
it
in
nine
years
ago
and
it
hasn't
gone
into
affect
here,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
hear
your
explanation.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
nothing
in
your
agreement
with
the
district
to
the
effect
that
the
district
will
not
permit
any
other
railroad
to
use
the
tracking
that's
within
the
district,
was
there?
justice
abe
fortas
we
didn't
bargain
for
that.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
icc
nine
years
ago,
an
order
authorizing
these
railroads
--
these
other
railroads
to
build
up
to
the
district,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
happen
in
those
nine
years?
don't
forget
to
tell
me
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happen
between
62
and
65
on
the
district
court
in
its
order?
justice
abe
fortas
so
this
is
sort
of
part
of
course,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
for
transport,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
it's
arguably
counsel
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
it's
arguable
and
it
hadn't
been
this
nine-year
delay,
this
railroad
have
been
allowed
to
go
ahead
as
the
icc
order
would
have
permitted
that
situation
at
lake
calumet
would
have
been
improved.
then
it
say
the
history
of
this
country
as
i
read
it
in
large
extent
compelling
among
necessary
facilities
like
building
of
which
they
took
facilities
necessary
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
they
--
did
you
say
that
at
the
time
that
this
contract
was
laid
between
the
district
and
the
appellants
of
for
use
of
the
rail
facilities
within
the
district.
you
had
no
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
your
contract
provides
that
when
a
final
contract
was
entered
into
court
of
appeals
exhaustion
with
the
appellants
that
you're
contract
will
terminate?
justice
abe
fortas
or
it
depends?
justice
abe
fortas
which
part
of
the
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
why
did
you
enter
into
that
sort
of
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
are
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
paid
them
for
the
use
of
that
tracks
before
1961?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
are
entitled
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you're
complaining
because
they
gave
you
interim
contract.
is
that
more
favorable
rate
than
the
contract
with
the
appellants
or
use
in
facts
within
the
district?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
was
it
that
lower
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
well,
wait
a
minute.
let's
take
it
a

easier.
suppose
to
apply
the

last
year.
would
you
have
to
pay
more
or
less?
justice
abe
fortas
about
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
at
the
--
on
the
basis
of
your
present
use
of
the
facilities
within
the
district.
applying
the
tonnage
rate
to
you
would
not
cost
you
any
interest?
justice

fortas
and
now,
you're
getting
in
your
time
machine
and
you
want
us
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
practical
rate
may
increase.
justice

it
is
not
when
the

machine?
justice
abe
fortas
show
the
rest
to
us
--
justice

fortas
now,
if
they
