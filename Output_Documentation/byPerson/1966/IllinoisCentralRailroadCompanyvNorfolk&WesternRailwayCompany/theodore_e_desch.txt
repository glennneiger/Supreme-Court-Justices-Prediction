mr.
theodore
e.
desch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
before
it
slips
my
mind,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
point
which
was
incorrectly
stated
by
mr.
posner
and
mr.
o'brien,
i'm
sure
invertedly.
they
said
that
there
is
just
one
railroad
serving
lake
calumet
presently.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
1957
and
presently,
there
are
and
there
were
rather
and
are
two
railroads
at
lake
calumet.
the
rock
island
which
i
represent
and
the
new
york,
chicago
and
st.
louis
railroad,
then
known
as
nickel
plate
which
since
that
time
is
been
merged
into
the
norfolk
and
western.
there's
two
railroad
services
at
lake
calumet
but
there
be
no
question
on
that
score.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
one
served
the
eastside
of
the
lake,
the
nickel
plate,
the
rock
island
the
westside.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
in
the
sense,
they
are
not.
no,
sir.
now,
the
district
court
held
that
were
was
no
substantial
support
in
fact
there
law
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
approval
of
additional
rail
service
to
lake
calumet.
we
submit
that
that
decision
is
correct
and
the
basis
of
the
record
before
the
court,
the
dictate
of
the
statutes,
and
the
findings
of
this
court
and
other
courts.
we
submit
that
the
issue
here
is
really
quite
simply.
assuming
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
service
to
an
area
and
we
submit
that
there
is
really
no
question
about
the
adequacy
of
existing
service.
the
commission
made
a
finding
in
its
order
that
rock
island
service
was
adequate
and
there
were
really
no
complaints
about
it
to
amount
to
anything.
assuming
the
adequacy
of
existing
service,
what
kind
or
quality
of
evidence
must
the
commission
have
before
it
to
support
a
valid
exercise
of
its
judgment
in
approving
additional
rail
service
which
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
will
be
required
to
serve
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
we
submit
then
that
there's
really
no
question
about
present
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
commission's
order
could
not
have
been
founded
upon
that
if
it
found
that
the
rock
island's
present
service
in
1957
was
adequate.
we
suggest
that
the
district
court
resolution
of
this
issue
was
quite
direct.
in
1957,
with
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
uncompleted
with
its
effect
on
the
great
lakes
shipping
traffic
really
unknown
and
with
only
10%
of
the
lake
calumet
project
constructed
neither
the
applicant
railroads
and/or
anyone
else
could
have
prove
that
the
proposed
additional
rail
service
would
be
needed
in
the
reasonably
in
the
future.
we
say
there
was
and
is
absolutely
no
need
for
additional
rail
service
at
lake
calumet.
in
the
absence
of
that
need,
construction
of
additional
rail
service
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
a
very
type
of
wasteful
competition
which
this
court
has
condemned
in
many
cases.
in
an
example
of
a
case
such
as
that
is
texas
and
pacific
versus
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe,
we
cited
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
now,
how
that
the
railroad
appellant
succeed
before
the
commission?
i
would
like
to
give
you
my
version
of
how
that
came
about.
first
place,
we
submit
the
timing
was
perfect
to
the
commencement
of
the
proceeding.
in
1957
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
lake
calumet
port
was
for
all
practical
purposes
still
on
the
drawing
boards.
st.
lawrence
seaway
was
in
its
development
stage.
it
was
uncompleted
that
time.
because
of
these
facts,
it
was
really
no
basis
for
a
certificate
constructed
upon
present
convenience
and
necessity.
the
commission
had
to
issue
a
certificate
it
had
to
be
based
upon
future
convenience
and
necessity.
this
we
submit
gave
our
opponents
before
the
commission
a
wide
latitude
in
the
gnome
of
speculation
and
conjuncture
and
guess
work
on
--
what
the
needs
at
the
port
really
work.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
certainly
not.
we
will
readily
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
we'll
readily
conceive
that
commission
may
use
estimates
and
predictions
as
to
the
future
and
i
will
treat
with
that
subject
in
a
great
deal
of
detail
in
a
moment,
mr.
justice
white.
now
how
could
this
so-called
evidence,
this
type
of
evidence
these
predictions
be
refuted?
we
contend
that
the
hearings
in
1957
that
there
would
really
no
factual
basis
for
the
estimates
which
respect
to
tonnage
and
increase
rail
traffic
at
the
port.
the
passage
of
time,
nine
years
now,
has
proved
us
correct,
we
submit.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
---
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
i
shall.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
explain
that
to
you
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
stated
in
our
briefs
and
argument
before
the
commission
that
the
commission
abused
it
discretion
in
accepting
in
relying
upon
this
type
of
evidence.
we
submit
that
our
position
has
been
vindicated.
now,
gaining
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
this
case
is
been
extremely
difficult
on
the
point
of
view
of
the
rock
island
and
pullman
railroad
company.
to
begin
with,
the
railroad
appellant
objected
to
the
intervening
petitions
filed
by
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
and
sought
to
deprive
us
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
our
position
to
the
applications.
the
fact
that
rock
island
had
made
an
investment
of
millions
of
dollars
out
of
lake
calumet
had
in
their
view
apparently
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
issues
before
the
commission.
our
brief
records
in
detail
the
large
investment
that
rock
island
made
in
purchasing
pullman
railroad
company
and
i
don't
go
into
that
now.
but
i
would
like
to
mention
the
a
few
of
the
many
important
and
valuable
contributions
that
rock
island
and
pullman
made
to
he
development
of
the
port
area
such
things
as
the
contributions
of
the
land
for
street
and
road
purposes
around
lake
calumet.
dedications
without
compensation,
pullman
railroad
company,
the
rock
island's
predecessor
port
gave
away
its
riparian
right
along
the
shore
of
lake
calumet
to
the
city
of
chicago.
it
donated
some
10
acres
of
land
to
the
us
government,
so
that
turning
base
in
number
five
could
be
constructed
that
if
amount
of
the
report.
these
are
the
substantial
contribution
that
my
client
made.
now
the
appellants
here,
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir,
prior
to
the
hearing
in
1957.
now,
the
appellants
have
made
no
contributions
of
the
development
of
area.
they
have
taken
no
interest
in
the
development
of
lake
calumet
until
in
1956
and
1957.
it
appeared
to
them
that
there
might
be
some
potential
insofar
as
traffic
is
concerned
at
lake
calumet
and
they
decided
to
file
its
applications
and
get
in
there
if
they
could.
it
might
be
well
at
this
point
to
examine
the
position
of
the
railroad
appellants
more
closely.
now
throughout
these
proceedings,
they
have
attempted
to
give
the
impression
that
they
are
motivated
by
a
desire
to
assist
in
the
development
of
the
port
and
to
furnish
additional
rail
service
for
the
benefit
of
industries
that
might
be
located
on
port
property.
the
true
attitude
of
the
majority
of
the
railroad
applicants
may
be
judge
from
there
past
conducts
in
this
proceeding.
and
we
suggest
the
story
begins
back
in
1947
sometime
ago.
at
that
time,
illinois
central
and
its
wholly-owned
subsidiary,
the
kensington
in
eastern
railroad
filed
an
application
with
the
illinois
commerce
commission
to
extend
a
spare
track
across
the
territory
in
railroad
of
pullman
railroad
company
to
gain
access
to
the
lake
calumet
port.
now,
this
was
prior
to
the
formation
of
the
chicago
regional
port
district.
it
wasn't
created
by
act
of
the
legislature
of
illinois
until
1951.
the
application
was
filed
by
the
illinois
central
in
1947.
this
application
of
illinois
central
was
resisted
by
the
pullman
railroad
company,
my
client,
and
the
new
york
central,
and
the
belt
railway
company
of
chicago.
those
two
railroads
are
applicants
in
the
proceeding
before
the
court.
now
in
1949
while
that
matter
was
pending
before
the
illinois
commerce
commission,
rock
island
purchased
the
pullman
railroad
company
in
approximately
350
acres
of
land
adjacent
to
lake
calumet.
the
consideration
rock
island
paid
for
the
pullman
was
$2,
200,000.00
and
that
acquisition
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
has
a
very
important
bearing
in
this
matter,
we
suggest.
rock
island
then
intervened
in
the
pending
illinois
commerce
commission
proceeding
to
resist
the
advances
of
the
illinois
central
and
its
efforts
to
get
into
the
lake.
to
make
the
long
story
short,
the
rock
i
--
rather
illinois
central
attempt
to
gain
access
lake
calumet
territory
was
afforded
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
which
held
an
opinion
filed
on
january
22,
1953
that
was
just
the
sort
thing
which
the
general
rules
controlling
competition
and
regulated
industries
were
directed
and
held
that
rock
island
was
entitled
to
the
fruits
of
its
investment.
and
that
illinois
central
should
not
be
able
to
invade
the
territory.
now
that
chicago
belt
intervene
in
rock
island's
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
acquire
pullman
railroad
company.
chicago
belt
urged
that
application
be
denied
and
that
it
be
permitted
to
acquire
pullman.
the
illinois
central
also
appear
in
that
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
contended,
the
ic
contended
that
it
would
have
no
objection
to
rock
island's
acquire
and
control
of
pullman
if
illinois
central
were
permitted
to
purchase
that
part
of
pullman
railroad
company
located
south
of
124th
street
in
the
city
of
chicago.
namely
that
part
of
pullman
which
serve
lake
calumet.
in
other
words,
i
see
he
wanted
the
whole
port
of
chicago
rather
the
port
of
lake
calumet
for
itself.
now
the
commission
in
approving
rock
island's
application
rejected
the
belt's
position
saying
that
--
there's
on
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
belt
can
do
as
good
a
job
as
or
superior
than
rock
island.
it
also
rejected
the
position
of
the
illinois
central.
and
the
reason
the
illinois
central
contended
that
it
had
--
it
should
be
permitted
to
purchase
the
south
part
of
the
pullman
railroad
was
it
up
until
1960
and
it
had
a
shorts
per
track
serving
two
ice
houses
at
lake
calumet.
when
the
ice
houses
when
out
of
business,
illinois
central
pull
up
it
tracks
in
1960.
it
had
no
tracks
there
since
that
time
until
1949
that
that
was
the
basis
upon
it
--
upon
which
it
contended
it
should
be
entitle
to
control
pullman
south
of
124th
street
and
serve
solely
lake
calumet
port.
the
story
continues.
in
1956,
further
applications
were
filed
by
chicago
belt
on
one
hand
and
the
new
york
central
and
michigan
central,
and
the
indiana
harbor
belt
two
subsidiaries
of
new
york
central
and
the
other.
each
of
these
applications
sought
to
preempt
the
field
then
service
to
lake
calumet
port.
when
these
railroads
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
now,
when
these
railroads
realized
that
they
might
frustrate
their
ambitions
by
fighting
among
themselves.
they
joined
together
and
filed
the
applications
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
this
proceeding
before
the
court
today.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
along
with
additional
railroads,
yes.
the
fact
that
rock
island
alone
is
performing
the
switching
service
on
the
westside
of
the
port
is
really
not
so
unusual.
it
is
a
utility
regulated
under
the
law,
applicable
to
all
railroads.
in
addition,
it
operates
under
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
the
rock
island
pull
--
purchase
the
pullman
railroad
company.
these
conditions
were
required
that
rock
island
performs
service
for
all
railroads
in
the
port
area
without
discrimination.
again,
our
compliance
with
these
pullman
conditions
and
that
what's
the
interstate
commerce
commission
told
them
does
not
question
in
these
proceedings.
in
this
proceeding
before
the
court,
the
commission
found
that
we
were
complying
with
these
conditions.
if
the
applicants
are
successful,
the
rock
island
investment
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
pullman
acquisition
case
will
be
seriously
impaired.
we
sank
$2,200,000.00
into
that
railroad.
then
that
result
of
the
success
of
the
applicants
in
this
case
would
be
the
nullification
of
the
former
of
the
action
of
the
commission.
applicants
like
to
say
that
our
position
at
lake
calumet
is
a
monopoly.
we
find
that
term
in
their
briefs.
we
submit
that
there
isn't
over
in
this
situation.
we
have
the
only
physical
access
to
the
area
out
of
lake
calumet
port
but
we
handle
cars
of
all
railroads
under
reciprocal
arrangements
according
to
pullman
condition
which
guaranteed
fairness
in
the
handling
of
all
the
railroad
traffic.
the
in
affect
you
might
you
say,
all
railroad
served,
they
came
at
port
through
the
switching
service
of
rock
island.
now,
the
applicants
would
supplant
our
switching
service
with
theirs.
but
really
it's
just
another
switch
engine.
that
would
be
a
joint
switch
engine
paid
for
by
all
of
the
applicants
that
would
be
the
same
type
of
switch
engine
as
ours,
people
by
--
crew
members
just
as
ours
are.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
not
directly
from
the
district
but
the
benefit
we
gained
by
buying
the
pullman
railroad
company
was
the
purchase
of
some
traffic
generating
potential
out
of
south
side
of
lake
calumet.
mr.
o'brien
was
absolutely
correct
a
moment
ago
when
he
said
that
we
have
hopes
for
the
future
at
lake
calumet.
certainly
we
did.
we
wouldn't
invest
$2,200,000.00
there
and
we
have
enjoyed
some
traffic
out
there.
but
if
left
these
applicants
in,
that
pie
will
be
cut
up
in
so
many
small
pieces
that
no
one
would
profit
from
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
chicago
regional
port
district
itself
finance
the
construction.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
we
do.
i
pay
under
--
we
pay
a
certain
charge
per
tires.
i'll
explain
to
you
in
little
more
detail
later.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
should
say,
we
did
not
have
an
agreement
with
the
port
district.
we
were
using
the
tracks
without
paying
compensation.
and
for
that
reason,
the
record
has
nothing
in
it
about
our
agreement
with
chicago
regional
port
district.
but
the
--
we
do
have
an
agreement
and
it
bears
on
these
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
was
made
in
the
december
of
1960,
sir,
to
be
effective
of
january
1,
1961
and
it's
been
effect
since.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
after
the
hearing
were
closed
on
october
11,
1957.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir
without
compensation,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
none
whatsoever
except
the
revenues
generated
by
our
movement
of
freight
for
tenants
of
the
port
district.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
about
350
acres
adjacent
to
lake
calumet.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
--
it's
belongs
to
pullman
or
the
holding
company
of
pullman.
you
see
pullman
is
a
railroad
company
and
then
there
was
the
holding
company
pullman
incorporated
which
owned
a
number
of
subsidiaries.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
we
didn't
pay
the
district
anything.
we
didn't
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
gave
the
district
none
of
that
land.
these
donations
by
rock
island
and
pullman
occurred
prior
to
1957.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
substantially
except
for
prices
we
have
sold
off
from
time
to
time
to
other
industries
that
it
may
help
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
riparian
rights
and
dedication
of
land
for
street
highway
purposes
in
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
at
the
various
yards
around
the
chicago
switching
districts
where
we
first
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
their
yards
and
our
yards
where
we
presently
interchange
traffic.
they
give
us
cars
of
freight
and
we
switch
them
to
the
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
it
is.
it's
approximately
10%
constructed
today
according
their
plans
that
were
introduced
in
events
in
1957.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
same
facilities
that
were
constructed
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
exist
today
with
no
change.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there
are
--
no,
sir.
there
won't
be
additional
track
it's
in
the
port.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
to
the
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well
if
they
get
in,
they
will
have
to
construct
the
short
piece
of
track
in
order
to
gain
access
to
port
district
trackage
and
the
--
if
they
construct
and
then
grab
each
other
trackage
rights
over
segments
of
their
various
railroads.
this
will
permit
each
one
of
these
six
operating
railroads
to
gain
access
to
the
port.
and
each
one,
according
to
their
plan
will
move
in
and
out,
twice
a
day,
deposit
cars
for
the
yard
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
and
we
will
lose
all
of
that
traffic,
exactly.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
perhaps
the
record
does
disclose
that
but
i
can't
recall.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
increased
sir?
no,
it
hasn't.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1958
which
was
the
first
full
year
of
operation
at
the
port,
our
traffic
at
the
port
was
that
the
level
of
about
17,000
or
18,000
cars.
and
i
believe
that
the
traffic
at
the
port
has
not
since
that
time
gotten
back
up
to
that
level
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
one
year.
in
other
words,
the
traffic
dropped
after
the
port
opened.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i'm
at
lost
to
explaining
myself
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
our
agreement
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
the
short
answer
sir
is
that
because
of
the
applicants
inability
to
negotiate
a
satisfactorily
lease
agreement
between
the
six
operating
railroads
in
the
port
district.
approximately
four
to
five
years
were
wasted
with
various
supplemental
applications
for
the
commerce
commission
and
the
various
withdrawals
of
agreement
from
the
port
district
and
submission
of
additional
agreements.
finally,
in
1962,
i
remember
the
hearings
were
held
in
the
1957.
the
commission
approved
the
so-called
non-exclusive
used
agreement
covering
that
applicant's
operations
over
the
port
district's
tracks.
now,
we
participated
in
none
of
those
negotiations.
we
don't
have
a
thing
to
do
with
it.
for
us
to
sign
the
non-exclusive
use
agreement,
what
i
mean,
our
capitulation
in
the
agreement
that
these
other
railroads
could
serve
the
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
various
pleadings
were
filed
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
complaints
and
supplemental
complaints
filed
before
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
oral
argument
before
the
court
and
a
considerable
period
of
time
before
the
court
entered
its
opinion
and
decision.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
you
might
say
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
not
at
all
your
honor.
i
plan
to
get
into
that
in
just
a
moment
in
great
detail
but
the
port
was
constructed
in
at
according
to
estimates,
according
to
the
proposal
for
its
construction.
it
was
a
10%
complete
in
1957
and
it
is
still
just
10%
complete.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
that
would
be
there
contention.
there's
no
question
about
it
but
we
submit
that's
ridiculous.
there
are
so
many
other
factors
which
control
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
about
--
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
the
industries
at
the
port
generate
the
traffic
and
receive
the
traffic.
in
fact,
that
one
railroads
presents
there
or
six
railroads
presents
there.
it
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
traffic
generation
--
generating
circumstance.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
about
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
and
that's
why
we
say
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--with
just
within
the
chicago
switching
district.
just
a
matter
of
a
few
mile
and
that's
why
we
say
that
the
commission
in
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
as
far
as
the
new
york
central
is
concerned
because
we
operate
to
the
west
and
to
the
southwest,
of
new
york
central
of
east.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
no.
pardon
me
your
honor.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
considerably
more
than
that
is
involved
there.
part
of
the
applicants
here
are
direct
competitors
of
rock
island,
that
western
and
south
western
railroads.
and
we
contend
as
in
judge
edwards
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below
found.
we
the
rock
island
have
$800,000.00
in
line
whole
revenue
that
would
be
subject
to
diversion
annually
if
these
applicants
got
into
that
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
generally
correct
mr.
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
that
--
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
railroad
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
the
railroad
that
serves
the
industry
is
locally
general
controls
the
tracks
and
that's
why
we
seek
to
keep
these
applicants
out.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
this
evidence
on
this
subject
was
offered
in
great
detail
at
the
hearing.
we
submit
that
it
would
cost
them
more
than
they
would
enjoy
in
revenues
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
detail
that
the
must
be
considered
in
determining
what
those
cost
are
which
i
really
can't
explain
to
you
without
reading
it
from
the
record.
but
we
submit
that
those
expenses
would
exceed
their
revenues
in
certain
cases
and
would
consequently
be
improvident.
that's
why
we
contend
that
this
should
improve
among
other
things
and
the
improvident
operation
in
allowing
the
applicants
into
the
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
generally
speaking
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
so
--
some
of
amount
we
admit
but
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
not
substantial.
it's
called
the
terminal
switching
allowance.
when
a
line
whole
railroad
moves
cars
into
a
switching
district
like
chicago
and
those
cars
are
destined
to
an
industry
which
is
not
local
to
that
railroad.
then
that
line
whole
railroad
must
switch
those
cars
to
the
switching
carrier
which
does
have
that
industry
local
to
it.
and
the
in
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
submit
not.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
submit
that
it
would
not
--
it
wouldn't
benefit
the
shipper
because
of
this
so-called
terminal
switching
allowances
are
absorbed
by
the
line
whole
carrier.
they
are
not
passed
along
to
the
shipper
freight
in
any
fashion.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there
are
number
of
factors.
the
very
opposition
of
some
these
railroad
applicants
to
traffic
on
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
you
see,
some
of
these
eastern
railroads
that
apply
to
get
into
the
port
really
opposed
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
they
don't
want
to
see
that
to
take
traffic
away
from
them.
so
that's
one
consideration
but
i
would
say
that
generally
the
biggest
consideration
is
the
other
failure
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
to
generate
great
lake
shipping
traffic
that
it
was
expected
to
generate.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
by
and
large
that's
true.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
you're
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
it
would
affect
all
ports.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
that
maybe
correct.
i
don't
know
but
i
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
submit
that
that's
not
the
case
here.
i
think
that
the
failure
of
st.
lawrence
seaway
to
live
the
expectations
because
it
is
effective
to
all
ports
in
the
great
lakes
system
just
about
the
same.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there's
the
trouble.
now,
we
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notices
and
some
facts
which
i'm
getting
in
a
moment
and
we
feel
that
they're
very
revealing
and
they
help
prove
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they
refuse
to
do
it
and
we
consider
that
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
don't
ask
this
court,
sir
to
take
--
to
second
guess
to
the
icc.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
we're
not.
we're
asking
this
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
did
asked
the
inters
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
won't
agree
with
you
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we're
asking
this
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
we're
asking
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
district
court
below
applied
the
proper
standards
of
review
correctly.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
no.
it
is
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
if
i
--
if
i
may
correct
my
statement.
the
court
below
correctly
remanded
this
proceeding
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
further
hearings
and
say
that
was
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
on
all
issues
before
the
commerce
commission
in
the
first
place.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
after
the
st.
lawrence
seaways
had
opened
a
year
or
two,
they
open
in
april
of
1959.
we
have
a
case
in
many
times
in
this
proceeding
because
of
the
piecemeal
approach
to
this
case
and
the
commission
took
to
file
further
pleadings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
each
time
we
got
an
opportunity,
we
used
it.
we
tried
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
facts
which
had
to
come
into
our
attention.
you
see
it's
our
contention
here
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
1957.
there
were
really
no
facts
upon
which
to
base
the
crucial
findings
of
the
commission
as
the
future
convenience
and
necessity.
soon
as
we
got
an
opportunity
to
submit
those
facts,
the
commission
we
tried
to
do
it
but
we
were
not
permitted
to
do
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
true.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
that's
why
we
suggest
that
these
petitions
--
these
applications
of
the
applicants
were
premature.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
we
don't
contend
that,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
we
don't
contend
that
here.
now
at
the
hearing,
the
railroad
applicant
said
that
there
were
plans
for
the
future.
they
would
render
inadequate
the
presently
adequate
rail
service
that
rock
island
furnished
at
the
port.
now,
just
what
was
the
evidence
before
the
commission
in
1957?
this
so-called
evidence
may
be
summed
up
this
way
in
our
view.
first,
that
lake
calumet
port
was
designed
to
become
the
major
deepwater
port
facility
in
the
port
of
chicago.
tonnage
anticipated
to
be
handled
through
like
lake
calumet
port
subsequent
to
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
would
be
in
the
range
of
$30
million
to
$58
million
tons
per
year,
rail
traffic
to
and
from
lake
calumet
port
during
the
coming
the
year
in
1958.
now
the
hearing
was
held
in
1957,
would
be
approximately
27,000
car
loads
a
year
and
could
easily
increase
to
76,500
by
1962,
possibly
115,000
cars
per
year
by
1968
and
anywhere
from
250,000
to
350,000
carloads
per
year
when
both
sides
of
the
lake
were
developed.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
fantasy
the
commission
considered
as
evidence.
now,
further
so-called
evidence
considered
by
the
commission
when
the
port
would
be
completed.
there
would
be
13
docking
ships.
by
1960
a
third
grain
elevator
and
five
additional
transits
sheds
would
have
been
constructed.
on
the
eastside
of
the
lake,
the
largest
commercial
tank
farm
in
mid
continental
america
would
be
built
by
1964
to
1967.
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
expected
rail
traffic
at
the
port.
none
of
these
predictions
has
to
come
to
pass.
traffic
--
rail
traffic
at
the
port
is
very
much
the
same
today
as
it
was
in
1957.
now
in
light
of
this
evidence
and
we
submit
to
this
is
really
no
evidence
at
all
and
the
fact
that
presently
adequate
rail
service
at
lake
calumet.
the
district
court
correctly
rejected
the
major
findings
of
the
commission.
now,
here
is
where
we
come
to
grips
with
the
real
issue
on
this
case.
it's
simply
to
substantiality
test.
it
prescribed
by
section
10
(e),
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
crucial
findings
rejected
by
the
court
below
and
i
quote
them,
“the
time
has
come
when
additional
rail
service
at
the
port
is
required
for
the
future
development
of
the
industries
now
or
here
after
located
at
the
port.”
and
i
quote
further,
“if
the
applicants
can
prove
as
they
have
herein
that
the
propose
construction
either
presently
or
in
the
reasonably
near
future
is
necessary
to
meet
the
public
meet
and
will
be
reasonably
profitable,
we
may
issue
a
certificate.”
now,
this
is
the
crucial
finding
that
the
court
below
found
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
in
light
of
the
evidence
before
the
commission,
the
proper
reviewing
standard
that
there
must
be
substantial
evidence
supporting
adequate
findings
was
correctly
applied.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
a
very
difficult
question
your
honor.
it's
easier
for
me
to
say
to
you
and
point
out
to
you,
why
there
was
not
proper
evidence
in
this
case.
it
is
difficult
to
determine
where
the
level
is.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
i
see.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
there
would
be
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
the
additional
bonds
had
been
sold
by
the
chicago
regional
port
district
and
that
they
have
additional
revenues
with
which
to
construct
the
additional
grain
elevators,
piers,
back
up
warehouses,
and
transit
sheds.
that's
one
thing.
now,
they
had
--
it
sold
their
initial
bond
issue
of
$24
million
and
used
every
penny
of
it
to
build
what
they
had
been
and
what
they
have
now.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
quite
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
can
answer
to
that
only
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
plans
that
our
concretes
or
no
plans
at
all
rather
for
the
issuance
of
the
any
further
bonds
in
the
construction
of
any
further
facilities
out
there.
they
are
discussing
with
some
developers
the
possibility
of
filling
the
north
end
of
lake
calumet
and
creating
what
has
been
called
the
chicago
metropolitan
food
distribution
center.
now,
that's
an
entirely
different
proposition
from
what
they
had
in
mind
that
the
hearings
in
1957
and
what
we
show
in
our
brief
here.
this
is
the
photograph
introduced
by
the
applicants
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
page
55
of
rock
island
brief
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
and
it's
icc
exhibit
number
h2
and
what
it
is,
is
a
photograph
of
a
plaster
perez
model
of
what
the
developers
of
the
port
had
in
mind
would
be
done
in
the
future.
and
the
facing
photograph
which
we
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
is
a
photograph
that
was
taken
in
april
of
this
year
showing
what
actually
exists
out
there.
it
shows
you
how
plans
and
hopes
didn't
materialize.
now,
the
case
of
american
airlines
versus
cab
teaches
us
that
future
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
certainly
arguable.
i'm
sure
that
they
will
take
that
position
before
the
commission
when
this
case
is
remanded
there.
we
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
american
airlines
versus
cab
which
teaches
us
that
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
must
be
grounded
on
a
hardcore
of
factual
possibility.
now
on
the
question
of
the
future
need
at
lake
calumet,
none
of
the
evidence
introduced
before
the
commission
neither
the
analysis
of
the
affect
upon
great
lakes
shipping
traffic
that
would
follow
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
now
the
estimates
of
tonnage
that
would
be
handled
at
lake
calumet
port
nor
when
and
to
what
extent
the
port
facilities
would
be
constructed.
none
of
this
evidence
had
a
hardcore
of
factual
possibility.
we
suggest
that
they
were
fashion
merely
from
guess,
guess
works,
speculation
and
surmise.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
in
the
light
of
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
it
did.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
certainly
did.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
stand
correct
and
they
abuse
their
discretion
in
so
holding.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
not
at
all.
if
i
may,
all
we
ask
this
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
all
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
find
that
the
district
court
was
correct
when
it
conceived
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
when
it
can
--
when
it
concluded
that
the
crucial
findings
of
the
commerce
commission
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that's
all
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
now,
the
appellants
here
they
set
up
a
straw
man
then
when
they
accused
us
in
the
district
court
of
failing
to
accord
the
commission's
expertise
its
due.
we'll
be
the
first
to
admit
that
administrative
agencies
are
knowledgeable
in
matters
that
their
supposed
to
supervise
that
the
commission
here
knows
all
about
railroads
and
that
it
must
and
should
--
it
does,
it
should
use
its
expertise.
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
court
in
reviewing
an
administrative
agencies'
determinations
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commissions.
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
do
it.
we
didn't
ask
the
district
court
below
the
court.
however,
it
seems
to
us
equally
clear
that
the
reviewing
court
should
only
--
must
determine
whether
a
proper
factual
foundation
with
legally
sufficient
evidence
is
present
in
the
case.
now,
to
permit
the
commission
under
unbridle
discretion
and
defining
the
type
of
evidence
on
which
it
will
act
with
the
best
the
reviewing
courts
of
one
of
the
most
important
checks
they
have
on
administrative
discretion.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
terminal
company.
these
were
all
guesses
by
this
gentleman
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
as
to
the
future
would
hold.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
the
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
so
many
tons
of
years
of
shipping
traffic
head
in
prior
years
moved
down
the
great
lakes
st.
lawrence
seaway
route
in
years.
for
instance,
1955
and
1956
which
in
our
view
would
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
need
for
need
future
rail
traffic
at
the
court.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
now
in
the
court's
opinion
below,
there
are
two
sections
which
we
would
direct
your
attention
to.
one
is
a
list
of
findings
of
the
commission
which
the
court
characterizes
as
important
and
for
which
the
court
below
find
substantial
support
in
the
record.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
now,
there
--
this
is
at
page
1409
of
the
record,
been
in
record.
lake
calumet
the
first
one
we
disagree
with
respectfully
but
we
disagree
with
it.
it
is
not
the
lake
calumet
harbor.
it
is
not
the
major
deep
water
port
facility
the
port
of
chicago.
there
are
others
there
are
more
important
as
the
facts
that
which
we
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
proof
that
the
--
these
other
facts
that
the
port
of
chicago
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
i
don't.
here
are
findings
of
the
commission
for
which
the
court
below
found
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
now,
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
assess
each
finding
of
the
commission
consider
each
one
and
decide
whether
it
had
substantial
support
in
the
record
or
not,
whether
substantial
evidence
supported
it.
now,
this
list
beginning
on
page
1409
is
a
list
of
findings
for
which
there
was
substantial
support
according
to
the
court.
yet,
further
on
beginning
on
page
1430,
there
are
--
there's
a
list
of
findings
which
the
court
decided
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
and
we
submit
that
these
were
the
crucial
findings.
now,
the
findings
of
the
court
found
were
supported
by
evidence
were
label
important
findings
by
the
court
and
the
court
had
to
go
through
the
commission's
order
and
comb
those
findings
out
and
list
them.
the
findings
which
the
court
decided
were
not
supported
by
the
substantial
evidence
of
record
were
listed
in
the
section
of
the
commission's
order
labeled,
“finding
and
conclusions”.
and
we
submit
these
with
the
crucial
findings
of
the
commission
which
destroyed
the
ultimate
determination
that
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
rail
service
when
those
findings
weren't
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no
such
findings
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
but
we
submit
there
are
many
other
factors
which
contributed
to
that
result.
not
just
the
fact
that
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
served
the
port.
things
such
as
the
length
of
the
shipping
season
on
the
great
lakes
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
is
the
position
of
the
rock
island
that
it
would
not
and
there
are
no
findings
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i'm
really
not
sure
your
honor,
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i've
--
to
be
--
in
my
view
of
it.
there
is
no
specific
finding
on
that
issue.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well
of
course,
they
contended
at
the
hearing
that
all
of
the
evidence
offered
tended
to
show
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
not
that
i
can
point
to.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they
expected
because
of
the
estimates
made
by
witnesses
for
the
applicants.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
commission.
the
commission
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
commission
expected
the
traffic
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
is
--
it
is
not
a
finding
to
that
effect
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
which
one
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
can
see
that
it
is,
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
because
that
finding
was
not
base
upon
substantial
evidence
in
the
view
of
the
court
below.
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
there's
one
that
is
one
implication
that
may
arise
from
reading
that
finding.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
but
still
remains
that
the
issue
here,
the
issue
below,
was
that
finding
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
we
submit
that
it
was.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
that's
correct.
now,
this
court
has
already
discussed
the
problems
involved
in
the
exercise
of
an
agency's
judgment
and
attempting
to
assess
the
needs
of
the
future.
the
case
we're
referring
to
is
u.s.
versus
detroit
and
cleveland
navigation
company.
we
believe
this
decision
makes
clear,
the
validity
of
the
decision
below
in
our
case.
in
detroit
and
cleveland,
it
was
noted
that
forecast
of
the
future
are
necessary
and
that
uncertainties
need
not
prevent
the
commission
from
taking
action.
however,
the
opinion
makes
clear
in
that
case
at
the
service
of
the
existing
carrier
had
been
prior
to
its
interruption
during
the
second
world
war,
insufficient
and
inadequate
of
finding
of
the
commission
which
the
court
in
that
case
held
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
in
addition
in
detroit
and
cleveland,
the
commission
expressed
doubt
that
the
existing
carrier
would
be
able
to
meet
foreseeable
demands.
it
is
a
current
we
suggest
that
circumstances
in
that
cases
are
totally
different
from
ours.
we
have
numerous
findings
by
the
commission
that
the
services
of
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
are
more
than
adequate
at
present.
and
that
both
lines
are
well
prepared
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
future.
it
is
further
distinction
between
these
two
cases,
in
detroit
and
cleveland
that
was
observed
that
the
case
before
the
court
was
not
one
when
there
was
service
being
presently
rendered
but
with
new
commerce
seeking
entry
into
the
field.
now,
here
we
have
a
--
precisely
that
situation.
we
are
rendering
an
adequate
service
and
new
commerce
are
seeking
entry
into
the
field.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
evidence
and
support
of
future
need
must
be
even
more
compelling.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
the
--
the
shippers
at
the
port
of
course
appeared
and
testified
in
favor
of
the
applications.
they
said
they
wanted
additional
service.
but
that's
understandable.
all
industries
want
all
the
service
they
can
get
and
all
shippers
would
like
to
have
the
service
of
the
--
of
more
than
one
railroad.
the
reason
that
we
were
the
only
parties
in
the
proceeding
protesting
these
applications
was
it
--
we
were
the
only
parties
in
the
proceeding
that
stood
to
lose
anything.
our
$2,200,000.00
thousands
of
investment,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
not
at
all.
of
course,
we
don't.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
all
i
can
do,
your
honor
is
to
refer
to
the
universal
camera
case
and
the
reviewing
court
must
consider
the
record
as
a
whole
including
the
body
of
evidence
supposed
to
the
commission's
view
and
making
its
determination
whether
or
not
the
findings
of
the
agency
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
we
say
here,
that
the
court
below
did
just
that.
they
consider
the
record
as
a
whole
and
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
which
we
offer
to
post
to
the
commission's
view
and
reach
the
proper
conclusion.
and
really
it's
not
for
this
court
to
second
guess
the
commission
as
rather
the
court
below
as
mr.
posner
would
suggest
you
should.
in
other
words,
you
shouldn't
dispose
to
the
issues
on
appeal
with
the
supreme
court.
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
court
below
misconceived
the
proper
reviewing
standard
or
grossly
misapplied
it.
then
by
long
string
of
cases
in
this
court
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
proper
application
of
the
proper
reviewing
standards.
now,
if
this
court
or
the
department
of
practice
followed
in
cases
such
as
universal
camera
and
pittsburg
steamship
company;
and
take
on
the
burden
for
determining
itself
the
validity
of
commission's
decision.
the
fact
since
1957
of
which
we
have
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
make
it
apparent
that
were
no
sufficient
factual
or
legal
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
commission.
in
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
within
our
judgment
was
the
evidential
predicate
for
the
commission's
decision.
and
some
these
consisted
of
the
assumption
that
st.
lawrence
seaway
would
be
completed.
the
estimates
of
tonnage
which
were
expected
down
to
the
port
of
chicago
first
thence
to
lake
calumet
port
and
the
estimates
of
a
tremendous
increase
of
freight
car
loadings
at
the
port.
these
were
the
estimates
which
the
commission
had
before
it
at
the
time.
now,
the
data
set
forth
in
the
corps
of
engineers
reports
and
the
annual
reports
of
the
chicago
regional
port
district
demonstrate
beyond
question
that
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
has
had
no
appreciable
effect
on
shipping
tonnage
at
lake
calumet
nor
upon
freight
car
loadings
there.
both
of
these
figures
have
remained
relatively
stable
since
1959
when
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
was
opened.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
overwhelming
failure
of
any
of
these
estimates
to
materialize
is
not
only
traceable
to
the
disappointing
effect
seaway
had
on
great
lake
shipping
in
general
but
at
least
in
part
to
the
lack
of
materialization
of
any
of
the
plans
and
hopes
for
the
development
of
lake
calumet.
lake
calumet
port
is
still
very
much
only
a
shallow
lake
six
miles
down
from
a
--
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
lake
michigan.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
is
my
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
it
is
my
understanding,
if
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
the
depth
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
and
the
welland
canal
and
all
those
other
streams
and
waterways
that
had
to
be
open
is
now
at
27
feet
graph
as
i
understand
it.
this
should
permit
just
about
any
ocean
going
vessels
to
gain
access
to
lake
michigan
and
on
the
rest
of
the
great
lakes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
it
is
a
crucial
aspect
of
great
lake
shipping,
the
depth
and
the
graph
the
vessels.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
believe
that
the
27
feet
of
graph
is
now
possible
in
the
whole
route
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there's
one
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
not
at
all.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
anybody
who
ships
traffic
on
railroads
would
be
a
good
prospect
for
a
location
in
our
railroad.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
that's
its
purpose.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they
would
just
be
granting
railroad
service
to
shippers.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
in
the
sense
and
insofar
as
its
real
property
is
concerned
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
where
it
doesn't
own
the
land,
it
doesn't
control
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
no.
the
--
there
are
other
owners
of
land.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
pennsylvania
railroad
bought
a
parcel
not
too
far
from
chicago
regional
port
district's
land.
and
that
it
purchase
the
land
at
least
it
back
to
the
shipper.
just
one
word
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
respectfully
suggest
your
honor
that
you
couldn't
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
as
i
don't
consider
that
that
is
a
fact
that
it
was
so
well
established
that
it
is
common
knowledge
to
a
people
who
are
consider
experts
in
the
railroad
business.
i
just
like
to
spend
a
word
on
the
point
raised
by
mr.
posner
with
respect
to
the
non-exclusive
use
agreement
covering
the
applicants'
use
of
the
fourth
district
tracks.
as
i
said
before,
the
rock
island
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
had
not
signed
an
agreement
covering
its
use
of
the
port
district's
tracks.
but
after
that
time,
in
1961
did
sign.
but
that
agreement
provides
that
upon
final
adjudication
of
this
proceeding,
it
will
terminate.
so
in
effect
if
the
applicants
are
successful
in
this
case,
rock
island
will
be
in
the
position
of
not
having
a
contract.
and
then
we
will
be
forced
to
go
the
port
district
and
negotiate
on
terms
substantially
similar
to
the
terms
to
that
non-exclusive
use
agreement
because
it's
so
provide.
so
really
when
the
commission
approved
that
non-exclusive
use
agreement
without
a
hearing
and
without
given
us
a
chance
to
cross-examined
as
to
the
facts.
it
approves
the
contract
which
would
bind
rock
island
in
the
future.
and
that's
why
we
say,
we
were
deprived
of
due
of
process.
and
the
court
below
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
and
no,
your
honor.
we
had
a
contract.
we
signed
our
contract
effective
january
1,
1961.
the
ultimate
agreement
between
the
applicants
and
the
port
district
was
not
finally
entered
into
until
1962,
when
it
was
approved
by
the
commission.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they've
negotiated
that
contract
over
a
five-year
period.
but
personally
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
our
contract
with
the
port
district
provides
that
upon
final
adjudication
of
this
litigation
one
way
or
another.
that
contract
will
terminate.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
this
litigation
here.
if
this
court
for
instance
should
decide
that
the
court
below
was
incorrect
and
that
the
application
should
be
granted
and
that
the
applicant
should
be
permitted
to
gain
access
to
the
port.
that
would
be
final
adjudication
at
that
time.
our
agreement
with
the
port
district
is
to
our
use
of
its
tracks
would
terminate
by
its
own
terms.
then
we
would
have
to
negotiate
with
the
port
district
under
terms
of
the
commission
approved
not
exclusive
use
only.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
it
was
an
interim
matter.
we
did
know
what
the
future
held
at
the
time.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
realized
that
the
port
district
had
a
right
to
some
compensation
for
its
tracks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
--
in
it's
prospectus
for
the
issuance
of
its
bonds.
they
stated
to
prospective
investors
that
the
certain
income
would
be
derived
from
rental
of
railroad
track.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
we
had
not?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
they
contend
it
that
they
were.
we
contended
that
they
weren't
and
we
enter
into
this
agreement
without
prejudice
to
our
respect
to
positions
in
that
regard.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we're
not
complaining
about
our
contract
with
the
port
district.
we
had
it
into
voluntarily
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
say,
“yes,
it
is.”
it
amounts
to
about
--
we
pay
about
$20,000.00
a
year
based
upon
the
level
of
compensation.
but
if
the
--
the
flowery
estimates
that
were
introduced
in
evidence
by
the
applicants'
witnesses
come
to
pass
will
have
76,000
cars
a
year
at
$2.00
per
car,
the
only
thing
$143,000.00
a
year
for
the
use
of
the
track.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
pay
about
the
same
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
according
to
the
applicants,
it
would.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
unusual
position.
it
wants
to
have
its
case
it
needed
to.
if
they
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
if
basis
of
this
issue
to
the
order
upon
this
high
traffic
potential
figures.
yet,
it
says
that
the
actual
payment
for
the
use
of
the
tracks
won't
be
very
high
because
the
level
of
the
cars
is
only
at
12,000
or
13,000
cars
a
year.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
it
may
take
longer
than
that.
it's
really
a
long
torturous
procedure
but
there
were
three
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
i
can
answer
you
very
shortly.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
many
times.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
on
the
finally
approved
not
exclusive
use
again.
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
before
it
slips
my
mind,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
point
which
was
incorrectly
stated
by
mr.
posner
and
mr.
o'brien,
i'm
sure
invertedly.
they
said
that
there
is
just
one
railroad
serving
lake
calumet
presently.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
1957
and
presently,
there
are
and
there
were
rather
and
are
two
railroads
at
lake
calumet.
the
rock
island
which
i
represent
and
the
new
york,
chicago
and
st.
louis
railroad,
then
known
as
nickel
plate
which
since
that
time
is
been
merged
into
the
norfolk
and
western.
there's
two
railroad
services
at
lake
calumet
but
there
be
no
question
on
that
score.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
one
served
the
eastside
of
the
lake,
the
nickel
plate,
the
rock
island
the
westside.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
in
the
sense,
they
are
not.
no,
sir.
now,
the
district
court
held
that
were
was
no
substantial
support
in
fact
there
law
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
approval
of
additional
rail
service
to
lake
calumet.
we
submit
that
that
decision
is
correct
and
the
basis
of
the
record
before
the
court,
the
dictate
of
the
statutes,
and
the
findings
of
this
court
and
other
courts.
we
submit
that
the
issue
here
is
really
quite
simply.
assuming
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
service
to
an
area
and
we
submit
that
there
is
really
no
question
about
the
adequacy
of
existing
service.
the
commission
made
a
finding
in
its
order
that
rock
island
service
was
adequate
and
there
were
really
no
complaints
about
it
to
amount
to
anything.
assuming
the
adequacy
of
existing
service,
what
kind
or
quality
of
evidence
must
the
commission
have
before
it
to
support
a
valid
exercise
of
its
judgment
in
approving
additional
rail
service
which
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
will
be
required
to
serve
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
we
submit
then
that
there's
really
no
question
about
present
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
commission's
order
could
not
have
been
founded
upon
that
if
it
found
that
the
rock
island's
present
service
in
1957
was
adequate.
we
suggest
that
the
district
court
resolution
of
this
issue
was
quite
direct.
in
1957,
with
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
uncompleted
with
its
effect
on
the
great
lakes
shipping
traffic
really
unknown
and
with
only
10%
of
the
lake
calumet
project
constructed
neither
the
applicant
railroads
and/or
anyone
else
could
have
prove
that
the
proposed
additional
rail
service
would
be
needed
in
the
reasonably
in
the
future.
we
say
there
was
and
is
absolutely
no
need
for
additional
rail
service
at
lake
calumet.
in
the
absence
of
that
need,
construction
of
additional
rail
service
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
a
very
type
of
wasteful
competition
which
this
court
has
condemned
in
many
cases.
in
an
example
of
a
case
such
as
that
is
texas
and
pacific
versus
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe,
we
cited
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
now,
how
that
the
railroad
appellant
succeed
before
the
commission?
i
would
like
to
give
you
my
version
of
how
that
came
about.
first
place,
we
submit
the
timing
was
perfect
to
the
commencement
of
the
proceeding.
in
1957
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
lake
calumet
port
was
for
all
practical
purposes
still
on
the
drawing
boards.
st.
lawrence
seaway
was
in
its
development
stage.
it
was
uncompleted
that
time.
because
of
these
facts,
it
was
really
no
basis
for
a
certificate
constructed
upon
present
convenience
and
necessity.
the
commission
had
to
issue
a
certificate
it
had
to
be
based
upon
future
convenience
and
necessity.
this
we
submit
gave
our
opponents
before
the
commission
a
wide
latitude
in
the
gnome
of
speculation
and
conjuncture
and
guess
work
on
--
what
the
needs
at
the
port
really
work.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
certainly
not.
we
will
readily
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
we'll
readily
conceive
that
commission
may
use
estimates
and
predictions
as
to
the
future
and
i
will
treat
with
that
subject
in
a
great
deal
of
detail
in
a
moment,
mr.
justice
white.
now
how
could
this
so-called
evidence,
this
type
of
evidence
these
predictions
be
refuted?
we
contend
that
the
hearings
in
1957
that
there
would
really
no
factual
basis
for
the
estimates
which
respect
to
tonnage
and
increase
rail
traffic
at
the
port.
the
passage
of
time,
nine
years
now,
has
proved
us
correct,
we
submit.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
---
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
i
shall.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
explain
that
to
you
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
stated
in
our
briefs
and
argument
before
the
commission
that
the
commission
abused
it
discretion
in
accepting
in
relying
upon
this
type
of
evidence.
we
submit
that
our
position
has
been
vindicated.
now,
gaining
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
this
case
is
been
extremely
difficult
on
the
point
of
view
of
the
rock
island
and
pullman
railroad
company.
to
begin
with,
the
railroad
appellant
objected
to
the
intervening
petitions
filed
by
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
and
sought
to
deprive
us
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
our
position
to
the
applications.
the
fact
that
rock
island
had
made
an
investment
of
millions
of
dollars
out
of
lake
calumet
had
in
their
view
apparently
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
issues
before
the
commission.
our
brief
records
in
detail
the
large
investment
that
rock
island
made
in
purchasing
pullman
railroad
company
and
i
don't
go
into
that
now.
but
i
would
like
to
mention
the
a
few
of
the
many
important
and
valuable
contributions
that
rock
island
and
pullman
made
to
he
development
of
the
port
area
such
things
as
the
contributions
of
the
land
for
street
and
road
purposes
around
lake
calumet.
dedications
without
compensation,
pullman
railroad
company,
the
rock
island's
predecessor
port
gave
away
its
riparian
right
along
the
shore
of
lake
calumet
to
the
city
of
chicago.
it
donated
some
10
acres
of
land
to
the
us
government,
so
that
turning
base
in
number
five
could
be
constructed
that
if
amount
of
the
report.
these
are
the
substantial
contribution
that
my
client
made.
now
the
appellants
here,
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir,
prior
to
the
hearing
in
1957.
now,
the
appellants
have
made
no
contributions
of
the
development
of
area.
they
have
taken
no
interest
in
the
development
of
lake
calumet
until
in
1956
and
1957.
it
appeared
to
them
that
there
might
be
some
potential
insofar
as
traffic
is
concerned
at
lake
calumet
and
they
decided
to
file
its
applications
and
get
in
there
if
they
could.
it
might
be
well
at
this
point
to
examine
the
position
of
the
railroad
appellants
more
closely.
now
throughout
these
proceedings,
they
have
attempted
to
give
the
impression
that
they
are
motivated
by
a
desire
to
assist
in
the
development
of
the
port
and
to
furnish
additional
rail
service
for
the
benefit
of
industries
that
might
be
located
on
port
property.
the
true
attitude
of
the
majority
of
the
railroad
applicants
may
be
judge
from
there
past
conducts
in
this
proceeding.
and
we
suggest
the
story
begins
back
in
1947
sometime
ago.
at
that
time,
illinois
central
and
its
wholly-owned
subsidiary,
the
kensington
in
eastern
railroad
filed
an
application
with
the
illinois
commerce
commission
to
extend
a
spare
track
across
the
territory
in
railroad
of
pullman
railroad
company
to
gain
access
to
the
lake
calumet
port.
now,
this
was
prior
to
the
formation
of
the
chicago
regional
port
district.
it
wasn't
created
by
act
of
the
legislature
of
illinois
until
1951.
the
application
was
filed
by
the
illinois
central
in
1947.
this
application
of
illinois
central
was
resisted
by
the
pullman
railroad
company,
my
client,
and
the
new
york
central,
and
the
belt
railway
company
of
chicago.
those
two
railroads
are
applicants
in
the
proceeding
before
the
court.
now
in
1949
while
that
matter
was
pending
before
the
illinois
commerce
commission,
rock
island
purchased
the
pullman
railroad
company
in
approximately
350
acres
of
land
adjacent
to
lake
calumet.
the
consideration
rock
island
paid
for
the
pullman
was
$2,
200,000.00
and
that
acquisition
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
has
a
very
important
bearing
in
this
matter,
we
suggest.
rock
island
then
intervened
in
the
pending
illinois
commerce
commission
proceeding
to
resist
the
advances
of
the
illinois
central
and
its
efforts
to
get
into
the
lake.
to
make
the
long
story
short,
the
rock
i
--
rather
illinois
central
attempt
to
gain
access
lake
calumet
territory
was
afforded
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
which
held
an
opinion
filed
on
january
22,
1953
that
was
just
the
sort
thing
which
the
general
rules
controlling
competition
and
regulated
industries
were
directed
and
held
that
rock
island
was
entitled
to
the
fruits
of
its
investment.
and
that
illinois
central
should
not
be
able
to
invade
the
territory.
now
that
chicago
belt
intervene
in
rock
island's
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
acquire
pullman
railroad
company.
chicago
belt
urged
that
application
be
denied
and
that
it
be
permitted
to
acquire
pullman.
the
illinois
central
also
appear
in
that
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
contended,
the
ic
contended
that
it
would
have
no
objection
to
rock
island's
acquire
and
control
of
pullman
if
illinois
central
were
permitted
to
purchase
that
part
of
pullman
railroad
company
located
south
of
124th
street
in
the
city
of
chicago.
namely
that
part
of
pullman
which
serve
lake
calumet.
in
other
words,
i
see
he
wanted
the
whole
port
of
chicago
rather
the
port
of
lake
calumet
for
itself.
now
the
commission
in
approving
rock
island's
application
rejected
the
belt's
position
saying
that
--
there's
on
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
belt
can
do
as
good
a
job
as
or
superior
than
rock
island.
it
also
rejected
the
position
of
the
illinois
central.
and
the
reason
the
illinois
central
contended
that
it
had
--
it
should
be
permitted
to
purchase
the
south
part
of
the
pullman
railroad
was
it
up
until
1960
and
it
had
a
shorts
per
track
serving
two
ice
houses
at
lake
calumet.
when
the
ice
houses
when
out
of
business,
illinois
central
pull
up
it
tracks
in
1960.
it
had
no
tracks
there
since
that
time
until
1949
that
that
was
the
basis
upon
it
--
upon
which
it
contended
it
should
be
entitle
to
control
pullman
south
of
124th
street
and
serve
solely
lake
calumet
port.
the
story
continues.
in
1956,
further
applications
were
filed
by
chicago
belt
on
one
hand
and
the
new
york
central
and
michigan
central,
and
the
indiana
harbor
belt
two
subsidiaries
of
new
york
central
and
the
other.
each
of
these
applications
sought
to
preempt
the
field
then
service
to
lake
calumet
port.
when
these
railroads
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
now,
when
these
railroads
realized
that
they
might
frustrate
their
ambitions
by
fighting
among
themselves.
they
joined
together
and
filed
the
applications
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
this
proceeding
before
the
court
today.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
along
with
additional
railroads,
yes.
the
fact
that
rock
island
alone
is
performing
the
switching
service
on
the
westside
of
the
port
is
really
not
so
unusual.
it
is
a
utility
regulated
under
the
law,
applicable
to
all
railroads.
in
addition,
it
operates
under
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
the
rock
island
pull
--
purchase
the
pullman
railroad
company.
these
conditions
were
required
that
rock
island
performs
service
for
all
railroads
in
the
port
area
without
discrimination.
again,
our
compliance
with
these
pullman
conditions
and
that
what's
the
interstate
commerce
commission
told
them
does
not
question
in
these
proceedings.
in
this
proceeding
before
the
court,
the
commission
found
that
we
were
complying
with
these
conditions.
if
the
applicants
are
successful,
the
rock
island
investment
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
pullman
acquisition
case
will
be
seriously
impaired.
we
sank
$2,200,000.00
into
that
railroad.
then
that
result
of
the
success
of
the
applicants
in
this
case
would
be
the
nullification
of
the
former
of
the
action
of
the
commission.
applicants
like
to
say
that
our
position
at
lake
calumet
is
a
monopoly.
we
find
that
term
in
their
briefs.
we
submit
that
there
isn't
over
in
this
situation.
we
have
the
only
physical
access
to
the
area
out
of
lake
calumet
port
but
we
handle
cars
of
all
railroads
under
reciprocal
arrangements
according
to
pullman
condition
which
guaranteed
fairness
in
the
handling
of
all
the
railroad
traffic.
the
in
affect
you
might
you
say,
all
railroad
served,
they
came
at
port
through
the
switching
service
of
rock
island.
now,
the
applicants
would
supplant
our
switching
service
with
theirs.
but
really
it's
just
another
switch
engine.
that
would
be
a
joint
switch
engine
paid
for
by
all
of
the
applicants
that
would
be
the
same
type
of
switch
engine
as
ours,
people
by
--
crew
members
just
as
ours
are.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
not
directly
from
the
district
but
the
benefit
we
gained
by
buying
the
pullman
railroad
company
was
the
purchase
of
some
traffic
generating
potential
out
of
south
side
of
lake
calumet.
mr.
o'brien
was
absolutely
correct
a
moment
ago
when
he
said
that
we
have
hopes
for
the
future
at
lake
calumet.
certainly
we
did.
we
wouldn't
invest
$2,200,000.00
there
and
we
have
enjoyed
some
traffic
out
there.
but
if
left
these
applicants
in,
that
pie
will
be
cut
up
in
so
many
small
pieces
that
no
one
would
profit
from
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
chicago
regional
port
district
itself
finance
the
construction.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
we
do.
i
pay
under
--
we
pay
a
certain
charge
per
tires.
i'll
explain
to
you
in
little
more
detail
later.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
i
should
say,
we
did
not
have
an
agreement
with
the
port
district.
we
were
using
the
tracks
without
paying
compensation.
and
for
that
reason,
the
record
has
nothing
in
it
about
our
agreement
with
chicago
regional
port
district.
but
the
--
we
do
have
an
agreement
and
it
bears
on
these
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
was
made
in
the
december
of
1960,
sir,
to
be
effective
of
january
1,
1961
and
it's
been
effect
since.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
after
the
hearing
were
closed
on
october
11,
1957.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir
without
compensation,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
none
whatsoever
except
the
revenues
generated
by
our
movement
of
freight
for
tenants
of
the
port
district.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
about
350
acres
adjacent
to
lake
calumet.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
--
it's
belongs
to
pullman
or
the
holding
company
of
pullman.
you
see
pullman
is
a
railroad
company
and
then
there
was
the
holding
company
pullman
incorporated
which
owned
a
number
of
subsidiaries.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
we
didn't
pay
the
district
anything.
we
didn't
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
gave
the
district
none
of
that
land.
these
donations
by
rock
island
and
pullman
occurred
prior
to
1957.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
substantially
except
for
prices
we
have
sold
off
from
time
to
time
to
other
industries
that
it
may
help
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
riparian
rights
and
dedication
of
land
for
street
highway
purposes
in
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
at
the
various
yards
around
the
chicago
switching
districts
where
we
first
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
their
yards
and
our
yards
where
we
presently
interchange
traffic.
they
give
us
cars
of
freight
and
we
switch
them
to
the
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
it
is.
it's
approximately
10%
constructed
today
according
their
plans
that
were
introduced
in
events
in
1957.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
same
facilities
that
were
constructed
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
exist
today
with
no
change.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there
are
--
no,
sir.
there
won't
be
additional
track
it's
in
the
port.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
to
the
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well
if
they
get
in,
they
will
have
to
construct
the
short
piece
of
track
in
order
to
gain
access
to
port
district
trackage
and
the
--
if
they
construct
and
then
grab
each
other
trackage
rights
over
segments
of
their
various
railroads.
this
will
permit
each
one
of
these
six
operating
railroads
to
gain
access
to
the
port.
and
each
one,
according
to
their
plan
will
move
in
and
out,
twice
a
day,
deposit
cars
for
the
yard
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
and
we
will
lose
all
of
that
traffic,
exactly.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
perhaps
the
record
does
disclose
that
but
i
can't
recall.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
increased
sir?
no,
it
hasn't.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1958
which
was
the
first
full
year
of
operation
at
the
port,
our
traffic
at
the
port
was
that
the
level
of
about
17,000
or
18,000
cars.
and
i
believe
that
the
traffic
at
the
port
has
not
since
that
time
gotten
back
up
to
that
level
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
one
year.
in
other
words,
the
traffic
dropped
after
the
port
opened.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i'm
at
lost
to
explaining
myself
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
our
agreement
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
the
short
answer
sir
is
that
because
of
the
applicants
inability
to
negotiate
a
satisfactorily
lease
agreement
between
the
six
operating
railroads
in
the
port
district.
approximately
four
to
five
years
were
wasted
with
various
supplemental
applications
for
the
commerce
commission
and
the
various
withdrawals
of
agreement
from
the
port
district
and
submission
of
additional
agreements.
finally,
in
1962,
i
remember
the
hearings
were
held
in
the
1957.
the
commission
approved
the
so-called
non-exclusive
used
agreement
covering
that
applicant's
operations
over
the
port
district's
tracks.
now,
we
participated
in
none
of
those
negotiations.
we
don't
have
a
thing
to
do
with
it.
for
us
to
sign
the
non-exclusive
use
agreement,
what
i
mean,
our
capitulation
in
the
agreement
that
these
other
railroads
could
serve
the
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
various
pleadings
were
filed
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
complaints
and
supplemental
complaints
filed
before
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
oral
argument
before
the
court
and
a
considerable
period
of
time
before
the
court
entered
its
opinion
and
decision.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
you
might
say
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
not
at
all
your
honor.
i
plan
to
get
into
that
in
just
a
moment
in
great
detail
but
the
port
was
constructed
in
at
according
to
estimates,
according
to
the
proposal
for
its
construction.
it
was
a
10%
complete
in
1957
and
it
is
still
just
10%
complete.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
that
would
be
there
contention.
there's
no
question
about
it
but
we
submit
that's
ridiculous.
there
are
so
many
other
factors
which
control
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
about
--
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
the
industries
at
the
port
generate
the
traffic
and
receive
the
traffic.
in
fact,
that
one
railroads
presents
there
or
six
railroads
presents
there.
it
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
traffic
generation
--
generating
circumstance.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
about
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
and
that's
why
we
say
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--with
just
within
the
chicago
switching
district.
just
a
matter
of
a
few
mile
and
that's
why
we
say
that
the
commission
in
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
as
far
as
the
new
york
central
is
concerned
because
we
operate
to
the
west
and
to
the
southwest,
of
new
york
central
of
east.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
no.
pardon
me
your
honor.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
considerably
more
than
that
is
involved
there.
part
of
the
applicants
here
are
direct
competitors
of
rock
island,
that
western
and
south
western
railroads.
and
we
contend
as
in
judge
edwards
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below
found.
we
the
rock
island
have
$800,000.00
in
line
whole
revenue
that
would
be
subject
to
diversion
annually
if
these
applicants
got
into
that
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
generally
correct
mr.
justice
white,
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
that
--
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
railroad
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
the
railroad
that
serves
the
industry
is
locally
general
controls
the
tracks
and
that's
why
we
seek
to
keep
these
applicants
out.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
this
evidence
on
this
subject
was
offered
in
great
detail
at
the
hearing.
we
submit
that
it
would
cost
them
more
than
they
would
enjoy
in
revenues
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
detail
that
the
must
be
considered
in
determining
what
those
cost
are
which
i
really
can't
explain
to
you
without
reading
it
from
the
record.
but
we
submit
that
those
expenses
would
exceed
their
revenues
in
certain
cases
and
would
consequently
be
improvident.
that's
why
we
contend
that
this
should
improve
among
other
things
and
the
improvident
operation
in
allowing
the
applicants
into
the
port.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
generally
speaking
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
so
--
some
of
amount
we
admit
but
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
not
substantial.
it's
called
the
terminal
switching
allowance.
when
a
line
whole
railroad
moves
cars
into
a
switching
district
like
chicago
and
those
cars
are
destined
to
an
industry
which
is
not
local
to
that
railroad.
then
that
line
whole
railroad
must
switch
those
cars
to
the
switching
carrier
which
does
have
that
industry
local
to
it.
and
the
in
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
submit
not.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
submit
that
it
would
not
--
it
wouldn't
benefit
the
shipper
because
of
this
so-called
terminal
switching
allowances
are
absorbed
by
the
line
whole
carrier.
they
are
not
passed
along
to
the
shipper
freight
in
any
fashion.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there
are
number
of
factors.
the
very
opposition
of
some
these
railroad
applicants
to
traffic
on
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
you
see,
some
of
these
eastern
railroads
that
apply
to
get
into
the
port
really
opposed
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
they
don't
want
to
see
that
to
take
traffic
away
from
them.
so
that's
one
consideration
but
i
would
say
that
generally
the
biggest
consideration
is
the
other
failure
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
to
generate
great
lake
shipping
traffic
that
it
was
expected
to
generate.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
by
and
large
that's
true.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
you're
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
it
would
affect
all
ports.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
that
maybe
correct.
i
don't
know
but
i
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
submit
that
that's
not
the
case
here.
i
think
that
the
failure
of
st.
lawrence
seaway
to
live
the
expectations
because
it
is
effective
to
all
ports
in
the
great
lakes
system
just
about
the
same.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there's
the
trouble.
now,
we
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notices
and
some
facts
which
i'm
getting
in
a
moment
and
we
feel
that
they're
very
revealing
and
they
help
prove
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they
refuse
to
do
it
and
we
consider
that
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
don't
ask
this
court,
sir
to
take
--
to
second
guess
to
the

mr.

no,
we're
not.
we're
asking
this
court
--
mr.
theodore

desch
we
did
asked
the
inters
--
mr.
theodore

i
won't
agree
with
you
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we're
asking
this
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
we're
asking
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
district
court
below
applied
the
proper
standards
of
review
correctly.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
no.
it
is
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
if
i
--
if
i
may
correct
my
statement.
the
court
below
correctly
remanded
this
proceeding
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
further
hearings
and
say
that
was
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
on
all
issues
before
the
commerce
commission
in
the
first
place.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
after
the
st.
lawrence
seaways
had
opened
a
year
or
two,
they
open
in
april
of
1959.
we
have
a
case
in
many
times
in
this
proceeding
because
of
the
piecemeal
approach
to
this
case
and
the
commission
took
to
file
further
pleadings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
each
time
we
got
an
opportunity,
we
used
it.
we
tried
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
facts
which
had
to
come
into
our
attention.
you
see
it's
our
contention
here
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
1957.
there
were
really
no
facts
upon
which
to
base
the
crucial
findings
of
the
commission
as
the
future
convenience
and
necessity.
soon
as
we
got
an
opportunity
to
submit
those
facts,
the
commission
we
tried
to
do
it
but
we
were
not
permitted
to
do
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
true.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
that's
why
we
suggest
that
these
petitions
--
these
applications
of
the
applicants
were
premature.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
we
don't
contend
that,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
we
don't
contend
that
here.
now
at
the
hearing,
the
railroad
applicant
said
that
there
were
plans
for
the
future.
they
would
render
inadequate
the
presently
adequate
rail
service
that
rock
island
furnished
at
the
port.
now,
just
what
was
the
evidence
before
the
commission
in
1957?
this
so-called
evidence
may
be
summed
up
this
way
in
our
view.
first,
that
lake
calumet
port
was
designed
to
become
the
major
deepwater
port
facility
in
the
port
of
chicago.
tonnage
anticipated
to
be
handled
through
like
lake
calumet
port
subsequent
to
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
would
be
in
the
range
of
$30
million
to
$58
million
tons
per
year,
rail
traffic
to
and
from
lake
calumet
port
during
the
coming
the
year
in
1958.
now
the
hearing
was
held
in
1957,
would
be
approximately
27,000
car
loads
a
year
and
could
easily
increase
to
76,500
by
1962,
possibly
115,000
cars
per
year
by
1968
and
anywhere
from
250,000
to
350,000
carloads
per
year
when
both
sides
of
the
lake
were
developed.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
fantasy
the
commission
considered
as
evidence.
now,
further
so-called
evidence
considered
by
the
commission
when
the
port
would
be
completed.
there
would
be
13
docking
ships.
by
1960
a
third
grain
elevator
and
five
additional
transits
sheds
would
have
been
constructed.
on
the
eastside
of
the
lake,
the
largest
commercial
tank
farm
in
mid
continental
america
would
be
built
by
1964
to
1967.
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
expected
rail
traffic
at
the
port.
none
of
these
predictions
has
to
come
to
pass.
traffic
--
rail
traffic
at
the
port
is
very
much
the
same
today
as
it
was
in
1957.
now
in
light
of
this
evidence
and
we
submit
to
this
is
really
no
evidence
at
all
and
the
fact
that
presently
adequate
rail
service
at
lake
calumet.
the
district
court
correctly
rejected
the
major
findings
of
the
commission.
now,
here
is
where
we
come
to
grips
with
the
real
issue
on
this
case.
it's
simply
to
substantiality
test.
it
prescribed
by
section
10
(e),
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
crucial
findings
rejected
by
the
court
below
and
i
quote
them,
“the
time
has
come
when
additional
rail
service
at
the
port
is
required
for
the
future
development
of
the
industries
now
or
here
after
located
at
the
port.”
and
i
quote
further,
“if
the
applicants
can
prove
as
they
have
herein
that
the
propose
construction
either
presently
or
in
the
reasonably
near
future
is
necessary
to
meet
the
public
meet
and
will
be
reasonably
profitable,
we
may
issue
a
certificate.”
now,
this
is
the
crucial
finding
that
the
court
below
found
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
in
light
of
the
evidence
before
the
commission,
the
proper
reviewing
standard
that
there
must
be
substantial
evidence
supporting
adequate
findings
was
correctly
applied.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
a
very
difficult
question
your
honor.
it's
easier
for
me
to
say
to
you
and
point
out
to
you,
why
there
was
not
proper
evidence
in
this
case.
it
is
difficult
to
determine
where
the
level
is.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
i
see.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
there
would
be
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
the
additional
bonds
had
been
sold
by
the
chicago
regional
port
district
and
that
they
have
additional
revenues
with
which
to
construct
the
additional
grain
elevators,
piers,
back
up
warehouses,
and
transit
sheds.
that's
one
thing.
now,
they
had
--
it
sold
their
initial
bond
issue
of
$24
million
and
used
every
penny
of
it
to
build
what
they
had
been
and
what
they
have
now.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
quite
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
can
answer
to
that
only
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
plans
that
our
concretes
or
no
plans
at
all
rather
for
the
issuance
of
the
any
further
bonds
in
the
construction
of
any
further
facilities
out
there.
they
are
discussing
with
some
developers
the
possibility
of
filling
the
north
end
of
lake
calumet
and
creating
what
has
been
called
the
chicago
metropolitan
food
distribution
center.
now,
that's
an
entirely
different
proposition
from
what
they
had
in
mind
that
the
hearings
in
1957
and
what
we
show
in
our
brief
here.
this
is
the
photograph
introduced
by
the
applicants
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
page
55
of
rock
island
brief
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
and
it's
icc
exhibit
number
h2
and
what
it
is,
is
a
photograph
of
a
plaster
perez
model
of
what
the
developers
of
the
port
had
in
mind
would
be
done
in
the
future.
and
the
facing
photograph
which
we
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
is
a
photograph
that
was
taken
in
april
of
this
year
showing
what
actually
exists
out
there.
it
shows
you
how
plans
and
hopes
didn't
materialize.
now,
the
case
of
american
airlines
versus
cab
teaches
us
that
future
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it's
certainly
arguable.
i'm
sure
that
they
will
take
that
position
before
the
commission
when
this
case
is
remanded
there.
we
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
american
airlines
versus
cab
which
teaches
us
that
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
must
be
grounded
on
a
hardcore
of
factual
possibility.
now
on
the
question
of
the
future
need
at
lake
calumet,
none
of
the
evidence
introduced
before
the
commission
neither
the
analysis
of
the
affect
upon
great
lakes
shipping
traffic
that
would
follow
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
now
the
estimates
of
tonnage
that
would
be
handled
at
lake
calumet
port
nor
when
and
to
what
extent
the
port
facilities
would
be
constructed.
none
of
this
evidence
had
a
hardcore
of
factual
possibility.
we
suggest
that
they
were
fashion
merely
from
guess,
guess
works,
speculation
and
surmise.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
in
the
light
of
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
it
did.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
certainly
did.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
stand
correct
and
they
abuse
their
discretion
in
so
holding.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
not
at
all.
if
i
may,
all
we
ask
this
court
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
all
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
find
that
the
district
court
was
correct
when
it
conceived
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
when
it
can
--
when
it
concluded
that
the
crucial
findings
of
the
commerce
commission
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that's
all
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
now,
the
appellants
here
they
set
up
a
straw
man
then
when
they
accused
us
in
the
district
court
of
failing
to
accord
the
commission's
expertise
its
due.
we'll
be
the
first
to
admit
that
administrative
agencies
are
knowledgeable
in
matters
that
their
supposed
to
supervise
that
the
commission
here
knows
all
about
railroads
and
that
it
must
and
should
--
it
does,
it
should
use
its
expertise.
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
court
in
reviewing
an
administrative
agencies'
determinations
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commissions.
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
do
it.
we
didn't
ask
the
district
court
below
the
court.
however,
it
seems
to
us
equally
clear
that
the
reviewing
court
should
only
--
must
determine
whether
a
proper
factual
foundation
with
legally
sufficient
evidence
is
present
in
the
case.
now,
to
permit
the
commission
under
unbridle
discretion
and
defining
the
type
of
evidence
on
which
it
will
act
with
the
best
the
reviewing
courts
of
one
of
the
most
important
checks
they
have
on
administrative
discretion.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
terminal
company.
these
were
all
guesses
by
this
gentleman
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
as
to
the
future
would
hold.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
the
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
so
many
tons
of
years
of
shipping
traffic
head
in
prior
years
moved
down
the
great
lakes
st.
lawrence
seaway
route
in
years.
for
instance,
1955
and
1956
which
in
our
view
would
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
need
for
need
future
rail
traffic
at
the
court.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
now
in
the
court's
opinion
below,
there
are
two
sections
which
we
would
direct
your
attention
to.
one
is
a
list
of
findings
of
the
commission
which
the
court
characterizes
as
important
and
for
which
the
court
below
find
substantial
support
in
the
record.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
now,
there
--
this
is
at
page
1409
of
the
record,
been
in
record.
lake
calumet
the
first
one
we
disagree
with
respectfully
but
we
disagree
with
it.
it
is
not
the
lake
calumet
harbor.
it
is
not
the
major
deep
water
port
facility
the
port
of
chicago.
there
are
others
there
are
more
important
as
the
facts
that
which
we
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
proof
that
the
--
these
other
facts
that
the
port
of
chicago
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
i
don't.
here
are
findings
of
the
commission
for
which
the
court
below
found
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
now,
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
assess
each
finding
of
the
commission
consider
each
one
and
decide
whether
it
had
substantial
support
in
the
record
or
not,
whether
substantial
evidence
supported
it.
now,
this
list
beginning
on
page
1409
is
a
list
of
findings
for
which
there
was
substantial
support
according
to
the
court.
yet,
further
on
beginning
on
page
1430,
there
are
--
there's
a
list
of
findings
which
the
court
decided
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
and
we
submit
that
these
were
the
crucial
findings.
now,
the
findings
of
the
court
found
were
supported
by
evidence
were
label
important
findings
by
the
court
and
the
court
had
to
go
through
the
commission's
order
and
comb
those
findings
out
and
list
them.
the
findings
which
the
court
decided
were
not
supported
by
the
substantial
evidence
of
record
were
listed
in
the
section
of
the
commission's
order
labeled,
“finding
and
conclusions”.
and
we
submit
these
with
the
crucial
findings
of
the
commission
which
destroyed
the
ultimate
determination
that
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
rail
service
when
those
findings
weren't
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no
such
findings
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
but
we
submit
there
are
many
other
factors
which
contributed
to
that
result.
not
just
the
fact
that
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
served
the
port.
things
such
as
the
length
of
the
shipping
season
on
the
great
lakes
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
is
the
position
of
the
rock
island
that
it
would
not
and
there
are
no
findings
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i'm
really
not
sure
your
honor,
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i've
--
to
be
--
in
my
view
of
it.
there
is
no
specific
finding
on
that
issue.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well
of
course,
they
contended
at
the
hearing
that
all
of
the
evidence
offered
tended
to
show
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
not
that
i
can
point
to.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they
expected
because
of
the
estimates
made
by
witnesses
for
the
applicants.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
commission.
the
commission
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
commission
expected
the
traffic
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
is
--
it
is
not
a
finding
to
that
effect
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
which
one
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
can
see
that
it
is,
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
because
that
finding
was
not
base
upon
substantial
evidence
in
the
view
of
the
court
below.
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
there's
one
that
is
one
implication
that
may
arise
from
reading
that
finding.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
but
still
remains
that
the
issue
here,
the
issue
below,
was
that
finding
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
we
submit
that
it
was.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
that's
correct.
now,
this
court
has
already
discussed
the
problems
involved
in
the
exercise
of
an
agency's
judgment
and
attempting
to
assess
the
needs
of
the
future.
the
case
we're
referring
to
is
u.s.
versus
detroit
and
cleveland
navigation
company.
we
believe
this
decision
makes
clear,
the
validity
of
the
decision
below
in
our
case.
in
detroit
and
cleveland,
it
was
noted
that
forecast
of
the
future
are
necessary
and
that
uncertainties
need
not
prevent
the
commission
from
taking
action.
however,
the
opinion
makes
clear
in
that
case
at
the
service
of
the
existing
carrier
had
been
prior
to
its
interruption
during
the
second
world
war,
insufficient
and
inadequate
of
finding
of
the
commission
which
the
court
in
that
case
held
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
in
addition
in
detroit
and
cleveland,
the
commission
expressed
doubt
that
the
existing
carrier
would
be
able
to
meet
foreseeable
demands.
it
is
a
current
we
suggest
that
circumstances
in
that
cases
are
totally
different
from
ours.
we
have
numerous
findings
by
the
commission
that
the
services
of
rock
island
and
nickel
plate
are
more
than
adequate
at
present.
and
that
both
lines
are
well
prepared
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
future.
it
is
further
distinction
between
these
two
cases,
in
detroit
and
cleveland
that
was
observed
that
the
case
before
the
court
was
not
one
when
there
was
service
being
presently
rendered
but
with
new
commerce
seeking
entry
into
the
field.
now,
here
we
have
a
--
precisely
that
situation.
we
are
rendering
an
adequate
service
and
new
commerce
are
seeking
entry
into
the
field.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
evidence
and
support
of
future
need
must
be
even
more
compelling.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
the
--
the
shippers
at
the
port
of
course
appeared
and
testified
in
favor
of
the
applications.
they
said
they
wanted
additional
service.
but
that's
understandable.
all
industries
want
all
the
service
they
can
get
and
all
shippers
would
like
to
have
the
service
of
the
--
of
more
than
one
railroad.
the
reason
that
we
were
the
only
parties
in
the
proceeding
protesting
these
applications
was
it
--
we
were
the
only
parties
in
the
proceeding
that
stood
to
lose
anything.
our
$2,200,000.00
thousands
of
investment,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
not
at
all.
of
course,
we
don't.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
all
i
can
do,
your
honor
is
to
refer
to
the
universal
camera
case
and
the
reviewing
court
must
consider
the
record
as
a
whole
including
the
body
of
evidence
supposed
to
the
commission's
view
and
making
its
determination
whether
or
not
the
findings
of
the
agency
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
we
say
here,
that
the
court
below
did
just
that.
they
consider
the
record
as
a
whole
and
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
which
we
offer
to
post
to
the
commission's
view
and
reach
the
proper
conclusion.
and
really
it's
not
for
this
court
to
second
guess
the
commission
as
rather
the
court
below
as
mr.
posner
would
suggest
you
should.
in
other
words,
you
shouldn't
dispose
to
the
issues
on
appeal
with
the
supreme
court.
if
this
court
concludes
that
the
court
below
misconceived
the
proper
reviewing
standard
or
grossly
misapplied
it.
then
by
long
string
of
cases
in
this
court
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
proper
application
of
the
proper
reviewing
standards.
now,
if
this
court
or
the
department
of
practice
followed
in
cases
such
as
universal
camera
and
pittsburg
steamship
company;
and
take
on
the
burden
for
determining
itself
the
validity
of
commission's
decision.
the
fact
since
1957
of
which
we
have
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
make
it
apparent
that
were
no
sufficient
factual
or
legal
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
commission.
in
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
within
our
judgment
was
the
evidential
predicate
for
the
commission's
decision.
and
some
these
consisted
of
the
assumption
that
st.
lawrence
seaway
would
be
completed.
the
estimates
of
tonnage
which
were
expected
down
to
the
port
of
chicago
first
thence
to
lake
calumet
port
and
the
estimates
of
a
tremendous
increase
of
freight
car
loadings
at
the
port.
these
were
the
estimates
which
the
commission
had
before
it
at
the
time.
now,
the
data
set
forth
in
the
corps
of
engineers
reports
and
the
annual
reports
of
the
chicago
regional
port
district
demonstrate
beyond
question
that
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
has
had
no
appreciable
effect
on
shipping
tonnage
at
lake
calumet
nor
upon
freight
car
loadings
there.
both
of
these
figures
have
remained
relatively
stable
since
1959
when
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
was
opened.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
the
overwhelming
failure
of
any
of
these
estimates
to
materialize
is
not
only
traceable
to
the
disappointing
effect
seaway
had
on
great
lake
shipping
in
general
but
at
least
in
part
to
the
lack
of
materialization
of
any
of
the
plans
and
hopes
for
the
development
of
lake
calumet.
lake
calumet
port
is
still
very
much
only
a
shallow
lake
six
miles
down
from
a
--
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
lake
michigan.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
it
is
my
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
it
is
my
understanding,
if
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
the
depth
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
and
the
welland
canal
and
all
those
other
streams
and
waterways
that
had
to
be
open
is
now
at
27
feet
graph
as
i
understand
it.
this
should
permit
just
about
any
ocean
going
vessels
to
gain
access
to
lake
michigan
and
on
the
rest
of
the
great
lakes.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
it
is
a
crucial
aspect
of
great
lake
shipping,
the
depth
and
the
graph
the
vessels.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
believe
that
the
27
feet
of
graph
is
now
possible
in
the
whole
route
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
there's
one
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
not
at
all.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
anybody
who
ships
traffic
on
railroads
would
be
a
good
prospect
for
a
location
in
our
railroad.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
that's
its
purpose.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they
would
just
be
granting
railroad
service
to
shippers.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
in
the
sense
and
insofar
as
its
real
property
is
concerned
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
where
it
doesn't
own
the
land,
it
doesn't
control
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
oh,
no.
the
--
there
are
other
owners
of
land.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
pennsylvania
railroad
bought
a
parcel
not
too
far
from
chicago
regional
port
district's
land.
and
that
it
purchase
the
land
at
least
it
back
to
the
shipper.
just
one
word
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
respectfully
suggest
your
honor
that
you
couldn't
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
--
as
i
don't
consider
that
that
is
a
fact
that
it
was
so
well
established
that
it
is
common
knowledge
to
a
people
who
are
consider
experts
in
the
railroad
business.
i
just
like
to
spend
a
word
on
the
point
raised
by
mr.
posner
with
respect
to
the
non-exclusive
use
agreement
covering
the
applicants'
use
of
the
fourth
district
tracks.
as
i
said
before,
the
rock
island
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
had
not
signed
an
agreement
covering
its
use
of
the
port
district's
tracks.
but
after
that
time,
in
1961
did
sign.
but
that
agreement
provides
that
upon
final
adjudication
of
this
proceeding,
it
will
terminate.
so
in
effect
if
the
applicants
are
successful
in
this
case,
rock
island
will
be
in
the
position
of
not
having
a
contract.
and
then
we
will
be
forced
to
go
the
port
district
and
negotiate
on
terms
substantially
similar
to
the
terms
to
that
non-exclusive
use
agreement
because
it's
so
provide.
so
really
when
the
commission
approved
that
non-exclusive
use
agreement
without
a
hearing
and
without
given
us
a
chance
to
cross-examined
as
to
the
facts.
it
approves
the
contract
which
would
bind
rock
island
in
the
future.
and
that's
why
we
say,
we
were
deprived
of
due
of
process.
and
the
court
below
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
and
no,
your
honor.
we
had
a
contract.
we
signed
our
contract
effective
january
1,
1961.
the
ultimate
agreement
between
the
applicants
and
the
port
district
was
not
finally
entered
into
until
1962,
when
it
was
approved
by
the
commission.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
they've
negotiated
that
contract
over
a
five-year
period.
but
personally
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
our
contract
with
the
port
district
provides
that
upon
final
adjudication
of
this
litigation
one
way
or
another.
that
contract
will
terminate.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
this
litigation
here.
if
this
court
for
instance
should
decide
that
the
court
below
was
incorrect
and
that
the
application
should
be
granted
and
that
the
applicant
should
be
permitted
to
gain
access
to
the
port.
that
would
be
final
adjudication
at
that
time.
our
agreement
with
the
port
district
is
to
our
use
of
its
tracks
would
terminate
by
its
own
terms.
then
we
would
have
to
negotiate
with
the
port
district
under
terms
of
the
commission
approved
not
exclusive
use
only.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
it
was
an
interim
matter.
we
did
know
what
the
future
held
at
the
time.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
realized
that
the
port
district
had
a
right
to
some
compensation
for
its
tracks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
--
in
it's
prospectus
for
the
issuance
of
its
bonds.
they
stated
to
prospective
investors
that
the
certain
income
would
be
derived
from
rental
of
railroad
track.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
no,
sir.
we
had
not?
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
they
contend
it
that
they
were.
we
contended
that
they
weren't
and
we
enter
into
this
agreement
without
prejudice
to
our
respect
to
positions
in
that
regard.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we're
not
complaining
about
our
contract
with
the
port
district.
we
had
it
into
voluntarily
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
say,
“yes,
it
is.”
it
amounts
to
about
--
we
pay
about
$20,000.00
a
year
based
upon
the
level
of
compensation.
but
if
the
--
the
flowery
estimates
that
were
introduced
in
evidence
by
the
applicants'
witnesses
come
to
pass
will
have
76,000
cars
a
year
at
$2.00
per
car,
the
only
thing
$143,000.00
a
year
for
the
use
of
the
track.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
we
pay
about
the
same
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
according
to
the
applicants,
it
would.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
unusual
position.
it
wants
to
have
its
case
it
needed
to.
if
they
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
if
basis
of
this
issue
to
the
order
upon
this
high
traffic
potential
figures.
yet,
it
says
that
the
actual
payment
for
the
use
of
the
tracks
won't
be
very
high
because
the
level
of
the
cars
is
only
at
12,000
or
13,000
cars
a
year.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
well,
it
may
take
longer
than
that.
it's
really
a
long
torturous
procedure
but
there
were
three
--
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
i
think
i
can
answer
you
very
shortly.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
yes,
sir.
many
times.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
on
the
finally
approved
not
exclusive
use
again.
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
e.
desch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
