mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
moment,
i
shall
speak
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
appellees
were
denied
improperly
a
right
to
be
heard
on
these
applications.
but
i
like
to
take
just
one
moment
to
speak
to
mr.
justice
white's
point
about
the
staleness
of
the
record.
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
the
appellees
asked
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
number
of
documents,
reports
and
photographs
which
indicate
that
lake
calumet
harbor
has
grown
less
explosively
in
the
year
since
the
hearing
before
the
commission's
hearing
have
in
1957
that
some
of
the
witnesses
at
that
hearing
predicted.
and
it's
the
appellee's
argument
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
--
there
is
a
difference
there
which
i
want
to
mention
in
one
moment.
they
say
the
appellee
has
argued
that
there
should
be
a
remand
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
for
a
further
hearing
because
of
this
alleged
dullness.
but
first
i
like
to
suggest
that
the
allegations
as
to
the
failure
of
the
port
to
fulfill
to
the
completely
its
promise,
the
predictions
of
its
traffic
is
not
a
new
development
in
this
case
that
the
commission
had
no
opportunity
to
fail
to
consider
in
a
way
because
in
a
petition
for
reconsideration
filed
at
the
end
of
the
1962,
the
appellees
brought
to
the
commission's
attention,
statistics
showing
the
tonnage
in
freight
cars
handled
by
the
port
between
1957
and
1962,
and
again
argued
that
a
new
evidentiary
hearing
was
necessary.
now
the
commission
denied
that
petition
for
reconsideration
and
i
think
correctly
so,
in
this
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
the
first
place
returning
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
commission's
decision
in
which
it
approved
these
applications
had
never
relied
upon
the
highly
enthusiastic
projections
of
the
witnesses
in
the
hearing
such
as
the
general
manager
of
the
fourth
district
court
who
had
given
specific
tonnage
figures
which
he
expected
to
before
to
attain
in
given
years.
all
the
commission
is
fumed
as
a
predicate
for
its
conclusion
that
this
additional
service
should
be
authorized
was
that
the
port
had
excellent
long
range
prospects
for
growth
and
development.
and
as
to
this
general
projection
of
the
port's
growth
and
prosperity,
there
is
no
official
in
this
case.
the
appellees
witnesses
as
well
as
the
witnesses
for
the
applicant
railroads
agree
that
over
the
long
range,
the
port
would
grow.
now
in
the
second
place
and
perhaps
--and
more
pointedly,
the
commission
had
found
not
nearly
that
additional
rail
service
was
necessary
to
handle
the
increase
traffic
that
was
projected.
but
it
found
that
rail
service
was
necessary
to
induce
the
hope
for
expansion.
commission
emphasized
that
the
port
needed
this
rail
service
from
the
outset
of
its
development
if
there
was
to
be
development.
and
the
reason
is
simply
that
as
the
record
amply
demonstrates
competitive
and
adequate
rail
service
is
an
enormously
important
factor
in
a
port's
competitive
position.
it's
clear
that
lake
calumet
harbor
competes
with
a
great
many
ports
not
merely
great
lake
ports
and
other
ports
in
the
chicago
area
but
ports
on
a
gulf
coast,
the
atlantic
ocean.
and
if
lake
calumet
is
to
compete
successfully,
commission
found.
there
must
be
competitive
and
adequate
rail
service
and
to
give
just
one
example
of
why
this
is
so.
the
commission
stressed
that
an
important
element
of
the
promise
of
the
port
was
the
center
of
the
grain.
the
international
grain
trade
and
it
was
evidence
that
the
operators
of
the
large
ships
which
applied
this
trade
are
very
leery
about
calling
that
ports
where
there
may
be
delays
due
to
adequate
railroad
cost
supply
or
perhaps,
the
strike
against
the
rail
carrier.
other
conditions
which
are
--
which
tend
to
be
associated
with
the
single
line
rail
service.
are
these
delays
are
very
expensive
to
this
ship
operators.
they
also
often
disturbed
the
credit
transactions
under
which
this
trade
moves.
so
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
in
the
last
10
years
when
due
to
this
protract
of
litigation
lake
calumet
harbor
had
the
services
going
to
be
one
railroad.
its
growth
was
less
than
anticipated
and
this
development
confirms
rather
than
undermines
the
commission's
conclusion.
and
we
submit,
it's
not
a
ground
but
for
a
remand
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
but
i
--
i
assume
that
there
must
be
a
reason
for
believing
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
that
would
not
--
that
would
certainly
not
be
true
everywhere.
but
all
of
the
witnesses
agree
that
lake
calumet
harbor
had
some
unique
--
had
a
unique
potentiality.
it
is
not
just
another
port.
it
happens
to
be
a
strategically
situated
between
the
great
lakes
and
the
mississippi
river
and
its
right
near
the
chicago
area
which
is
a
great
industrial
center
and
it
was
believed
that
the
port
had
a
natural
potential
for
large
growth.
and
it
was
also
felt
that
additional
rail
service
was
needed
if
that
potential
was
to
be
realized.
i
mentioned
in
this
connection
that
the
commission
also
have
emphasize
how
anomalous
it
is
in
this
nation
for
a
major
public
port
facility,
like
lake
calumet
harbor
to
be
served
by
only
one
railroad.
the
evidence
showed
that
this
is
unusual
circumstance
for
a
harbor
of
this
cite
quite
apart
from
projections
of
increased
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
this
was
not
a
finding
based
merely
on
the
commission's
general
knowledge
of
the
railroad
industry.
the
port's
general
manager
and
other
witnesses
testified
that
there
were
delays
and
other
problems
this
--
and
higher
cost
associated
with
single
railroad
service
and
that
the
operators
of
the
ships
which
conduct
this
grain
trade
would
refuse
to
call
at
lake
calumet
harbor
for
this
reason.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
with
the
respect
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
once
it's
granted
that
competitive
rail
service
is
necessary.
i
should
think
that
the
number
of
railroads
to
be
admitted
would
depend
principally
on
whether
the
projected
traffic
was
capable
of
sustain
them.
if
as
the
commission
found
these
seven
railroads
can
operate
profitably
and
economically
there,
they
should
allow
to
get
an
additional
point.
and
that
is
that
these
seven
railroads
among
them
will
provide
direct
access
to
all
i
believe,
all
the
major
rail
carriers
that
would
be
serving
lake
calumet
harbor.
all
that
draws
from
the
grain
producing
regions.
i
also
might
mention
that
these
railroads
are
not
going
to
operate
helter-skelter
in
the
port
but
have
worked
out
an
agreement
for
coordinating
their
operations.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
this
has
all
been
held
up
by
this
litigation.
now,
i
should
like
to
devote
the
balance
of
my
time
to
the
second
issue
here.
mr.
o'brien
discussed
whether
that
public
interest
--
public
convince
a
necessity
present
or
future
requires
the
additional
rail
service
proposed
by
the
applicants
and
i
should
like
to
deal
with
contention
of
the
appellees
that
they
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
of
the
agreement
which
the
six
applicant
railroads
entered
into
with
the
chicago
regional
port
district.
that
is
the
public
authority
which
has
developed
and
which
administers
the
port
and
the
agreement
which
i
would
speak
from
that
in
that
which
govern
--
which
was
to
govern
the
use
of
the
10
or
so
miles
of
tracks
which
the
port
district
had
built
in
the
harbor
area
by
these
six
railroads.
and
if
the
court
will
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
a
moment,
i
think
i
can
define
the
issue
more
particularly
by
tracing
how
this
agreement
governing
the
use
of
the
tracks
came
into
the
case
and
was
dealt
with
by
the
commission.
now,
from
the
very
outset
of
the
proceeding
of
the
hearings
happen
in
1957.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
the
applicants
were
contemplating
service
within
the
court
itself
over
the
tracks
which
the
district
had
built
there,
a
use
of
tracks
which
would
of
course
require
the
district's
agreement.
the
applicants
were
not
interested
million
transporting
the
goods
and
to
and
from
the
district
line
but
of
--
obviously,
they
wanted
to
served
the
warehouses
and
grain
elevators
and
transit
shares
and
other
facilities
located
within
the
harbor
area
on
adjacent
to
tracks
which
the
port
district
had
built
for
this
purpose.
and
so,
agreement
was
regarded
from
the
beginning
as
an
essential
aspect
of
the
controversy.
it
was
introduced
into
the
record
and
it
was
subject
of
testimony
and
cross-examination.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
everyone
connected
with
the
proceeding
assumed
that
the
feasibility
of
the
arrangements
which
the
railroads
would
workout
with
the
port
district
was
an
essential
factor
and
whether
the
commission
should
grant
permission
for
the
additional
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
rock
island
operates
under
a
contract
with
the
port
district
under
which
it
pays
no
compensations
which
is
use.
i
shall
explain
its
arrangement
with
the
port
district
is
not
affected
by
the
agreement
which
the
applicants
made.
now
why
would
i
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
the
agreement
was
in
the
record
in
the
hearing
before
the
examiner
and
was
discussed
and
was
a
focal
point
of
controversy.
the
railroads,
the
applicant
railroads
had
not
asked
specifically
for
in
their
applications
for
express
authority
to
operate
over
the
port
district's
tracks.
they
didn't
do
that
because
there
was
a
question
whether
such
specific
authority
was
required.
one
reason
they
didn't
is
the
rock
island
under
the
contract
are
mention
by
mr.
justice
brennan
had
never
sought
the
commission
approval
feeling
the
--
that
that
was
not
necessary.
the
commission
however
found
that
the
original
applications
were
deficient
in
the
failing
to
request
this
authority
and
that
the
six
railroads
could
not
be
used
to
port
district's
tracks
unless
they
asked
for
authority
to
do
so
from
the
commission.
however,
the
commission
beamed
this
as
a
technical
deficiency
and
permitted
the
applicants
to
remedy
it
by
filing
a
supplemental
--
supplement
to
the
applications
or
supplemental
application
in
which
they
are
ask
for
this
authority.
and
the
commission
granted
the
application
without
a
further
hearing.
now
so
far
i
think,
there's
no
serious
question
of
a
denial
of
hearing
because
the
agreement
which
the
commission
approved
was
the
identical
one
was
wholly
immaterial
changes,
identical
to
the
one
that
has
been
in
the
record
--
in
the
proceeding
before
the
examiner.
however,
after
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
--
they
i
--
i
assume,
perhaps
been
correctly
that
the
original
application
was
that
the
supplement
to
the
application
was
served
--
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--served
on
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
on
the
appellee.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
but
in
any
event,
they
immediately
filed
this
--
had
throughout
this
proceeding
file
and
after
the
commission
approved
it
filed
and
objecting
document
and
the
commission
reaffirmed
its
determination
on
--
i
mean,
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
excuse
me
just
one
second.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
when
the
appellants
filed
their
supplement
in
the
application,
the
appellees
promptly
filed
a
document
to
strike
it
as
improper
and
made
a
number
of
contention
address
to
it.
so
they
did
have
to
applicants
we
have.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
now,
if
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
objected
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
this
approval.
but
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
these
suggestions
had
been
made
and
considered
in
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner.
so
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
new
evidence
that
require
additional
hearing.
as
i
say,
after
the
commission
approved
the
application
with
the
agreement
governing
the
use
these
tracks.
the
applicants
in
the
port
district
then
modified
the
agreement
and
the
commission
approved
the
modified
agreement
without
a
further
evidentiary
hearing,
although,
with
notice
--
full
notice
and
argument
for
the
appellees.
our
contention
however
is
that
that
this
modification
was
not
material.
it
did
not
raise
factual
issues
which
required
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now
the
modification,
the
only
even
arguably
material
modification,
there
were
small
changes
and
worthy
community
here
had
to
do
with
computation
of
the
rental
that
the
applicants
would
be
required
to
pay
the
port
district
to
use
this
10
miles
or
so
track
within
the
district.
now
in
the
original
agreement
at
which
i
repeat,
there
had
been
full
hearing,
full
canvassing
of
the
issues.
the
annual
rental
for
the
use
of
the
tracks
was
to
be
the
lower
of
two
figures.
the
first
of
this
was
5%
of
the
current
assessed
valuation
of
the
rail
facilities
in
the
district.
and
that
5%
figure
would
have
come
out
to
about
$35,000.00
per
year.
the
second
figure
was
to
be
computed
by
multiplying
the
number
of
cars
handled
to
or
from
the
district
in
a
year
including
locomotives
and
empty
cars
by
$2.00.
so
that
would
--
these
two
methods
of
computation
which
ever
produced
the
lower
rental
would
be
the
yearly
sum
due.
now
it's
finally
executed
and
approved
by
the
commission,
the
percentage
evaluation
term
which
i
say
would
have
come
out
to
that
$35,000.00
was
deleted.
and
the
rent
became
a
flat
per
car
rate
of
$2.00.
now,
there
was
some
change
in
the
definition
of
car
that
is
to
exclude
locomotives
and
most
empty
cars.
basically
the
new
rate
is
$2.00
per
revenue
car
loaded
or
partially
loaded.
so
what
the
question
of
a
right
to
a
hearing
boils
down
to,
is
whether
commission
was
required
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
this
change
in
rental
formula
might
so
undermined
the
ability
of
the
applicants
to
provide
a
--
an
economical
and
a
self-sustaining
service
that
the
application
should
be
denied.
now,
we
say
that
it
was
not
material.
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
that,
it
is
quite
obvious
to
the
commission
and
to
this
court,
the
railroad
industry
is
one
traditionally
played
by
very
heavy
fixed
costs
that
arriving
from
its
investment
in
tracks,
real
estate
and
engines,
and
repairs
shops
and
the
like.
and
whatever
fixed
cost
to
this
sort
of
large
part
of
total
costs.
the
value
of
the
business
that
affirmed
is
able
to
generate
becomes
critical
to
its
ability
to
make
money.
the
more
it
sells,
the
railroad
industry,
the
more
traffic
it
handles.
the
more
revenue
it
has
to
cover
these
heavy
fixed
costs
which
by
definition
remain
constant
while
the
traffic
increases.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
--
if
the
commission
originally
found.
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
railroads
to
be
paid
$2.00
per
car
whether
it's
a
volume
was
relatively
low
that
is
up
to
the
$35,000.00
percent
of
valuation
figure.
now
therefore,
it
must
be
reasonable
for
it
to
be
able
to
pay
at
the
same
rate
when
its
volume
increases.
now,
if
that
become
a
little
confusing,
let
me
restate
it
slightly.
under
the
old
agreement,
you
would
pay
$2.00
a
car
but
not
in
excess
of
the
5%
of
figure
is
$35,000.00.
so,
if
he
carried
17,000
cars
a
year.
you
would
pay
the
$2.00
rate,
$34,000.00.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
carry
20,000
cars,
you
would
pay
only
the
5%
figure
which
was
lower.
so
under
the
new
agreement
which
eliminates
this
5%
figure,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
total
rental
in
any
year
might
exceed
that
under
the
old
agreement.
if
they
carry
30,000
cars,
they
will
have
to
pay
$60,000.00
roughly.
but
as
i
say,
if
the
railroads
could
pay
these
$2.00
rates
when
volume
is
very
poor,
it's
down
on
the
2,000
or
3,000
cars
a
year
level.
they
should
certainly
be
able
to
pay
it
when
there
volume
is
good
because
if
their
traffic
is
heavy.
they
will
have
all
the
more
revenue
to
be
covering
there
heavy
fixed
cost
and
this
flat
$2.00
rate
will
be
less
burden
to
this
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
the
appellees
--
the
agreement
expressly
provides
that
it
shall
affect
any
rights
that
the
rock
island
railroad
might
have
under
its
preexisting
arrangements
with
the
district.
and
as
i
mentioned
it
currently
carries
the
cars
over
the
district
tracks
for
no
rental
payment.
now
it's
conceivable
that
the
district
will
in
the
future
sometime
want
to
receive
rental
from
the
rock
island
as
well
but
the
agreement
does
find
them
and
as
mr.
o'brien
pointed
out.
the
statement
in
the
dissenting
that
plan
that
the
appellees
were
somehow
being
subjected
to
an
agreement
which
that
not
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
is
utterly
without
foundation
in
the
record.
now
in
addition
to
what
--
it
seems
to
us
and
to
the
commission,
the
logic
of
the
situation.
why
this
change
in
the
rental
in
fact
that
was
immaterial?
commission
also
stated
and
i
think
with
considerable
foundation
that
in
general
it
is
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
accord
a
measure
of
difference
two
rentals
terms
which
had
been
fixed
by
arms
length
bargaining
between
the
--
between
parties
which
have
a
rough
equality
of
bargaining
power.
and
i
think
that
principle
is
particularly
valid
here
because
it's
quite
clear
that
the
port
district
does
not
have
an
interest
indulging
the
railroads
and
charging
them
a
rate
which
will
conclude
them
offering
a
self-sustaining
service.
as
i
mention,
the
port
district
has
allowed
the
rock
island
to
carry
cars
over
its
lines
at
no
rental
and
there's
--
let's
say
the
port
is
desperately
eager
to
a
track
adequate
rail
service.
it's
a
public
non-profit
body.
there's
no
reason
or
suppose
that
it
is
out
to
gouge
the
railroad
so
that
the
railroads
would
be
--
would
bind
themselves
to
an
exorbitant
rental.
and
just
to
touch
right
briefly
on
the
point
raise
by
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
bearing
of
the
universal
camera
case.
assuming
that
this
court,
eventhough,
this
is
a
direct
appeal
that
would
ordinarily
accord
a
measure
of
difference
to
the
district
court's
handling
of
the
factual
issues
here.
i
would
again
stress
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
this
majority
opinion
was
drafted
and
which
i
think
undermines
whatever
authority
it
would
other
applies
bring
with
it.
it
is
a
--
it
was
the
material
portions
on
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
issues
were
borrowed
verbatim
from
the
dissenting
opinion.
all
of
the
essentials
subsidiary
area
findings
of
the
commission
were
declared
by
the
majority
to
have
ample
--
to
have
substantial
support
in
the
record
and
all
--
and
in
essence
all
the
majority
did
was
to
insert
the
word
not
before
the
commission's
--
before
the
dissenting
page
conclusion
that
the
commission's
ultimate
findings
and
order
had
ample
support
in
the
record.
and
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
much
less
deference
is
due
the
majority
opinion.
and
in
conclusion
then,
we
urge
that
the
commission's
orders
here
both
insofar
as
they
approved
the
additional
rail
service
which
the
applicant
railroads
propose
and
also
insofar
as
they
approved
the
applicant's
arrangement
with
the
port
district
should
be
sustained,
and
without
any
further
hearings
to
delay
this
litigation
which
already
has
prevented
like
lake
calumet
harbor
from
realizing
its
potentials
for
these
10
years
of
litigating.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
return
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
for
a
moment.
the
form
of
agreement
between
the
applicant
railroads
and
the
port
district
was
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
original
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner
and
its
term
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
excuse
me.
the
original
--
the
form
of
agreement
between
the
applicant
railroads
and
the
port
district
was
an
exhibit
in
the
record
before
the
hearing
examiner.
it
was
subject
to
testimony
and
to
cross-examination.
now,
they
finally
executed
agreement
was
not
subject
of
a
separate
evidentiary
hearing
and
as
i've
said
the
single
material
change
was
in
the
computation
of
the
rental
agreement
and
our
contention
is
simply
that
a
hearing
was
not
required
on
that
change
because
it
did
not
raised
a
serious
factual
question.
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
commission
had
made
an
expressed
finding
that
additional
rail
service
was
necessary
to
enable
the
port
to
realize
its
potential
and
at
page
310
of
the
printed
record
which
is
the
portion
of
the
commission's
report.
there
is
a
paragraph
dealing
with
this.
the
commission
states,
if
the
time
has
come
when
additional
rail
service
at
the
port
is
required
for
the
future
development
of
the
industries
now
or
hereafter
to
be
located
there
and
further
along
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
--
no.
i
would
put
the
emphasis
on
future
development
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
further
it
down
the
paragraph,
i
think
it
is
expressed
because
the
commission
says
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
310,
which
it
said,
it
would
be
a
detriment
and
hindrance
to
the
full
and
complete
development
of
lake
calumet
harbor
if
it
were
limited
to
the
service
of
the
single
railroad.
on
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
quite
that
way.
i
would
say
that,
railroad
--
additional
railroad
service
per
se
will
not
bring
additional
traffic
to
the
port.
but
the
potential
of
the
port
in
terms
of
its
location
and
facilities
to
induced
additional
traffic
depends
on
additional
rail
service.
additional
rail
service
is
a
necessary
although
not
as
sufficient
condition
to
induce
this
additional
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
i
don't
think
the
commission
found
that.
i
think
what
the
commission
found
was
that
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
and
other
developments
would
attract
additional
service
to
the
port
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
was
certainly
the
commission's
belief
that
the
port
would
grow
and
would
have
addi
--
and
would
attract
more
service
so
that
these
additional
railroads
would
be
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
--
i
think
what
the
commission
is
saying
is,
there
will
be
more
traffic
in
business
but
unless
additional
service
is
authorize
now
at
the
outset
of
this
development.
the
development
may
not
materialize
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right.
there
are
many
great
lakes
ports.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true.
and
i
like
to
suggest
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct,
yes.
and
i
think
that
on
page
8
of
the
appellant
railroad's
brief,
there
is
a
list
of
record
citations
of
the
underline
evidence
which
supports
this
finding.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
--
that
is
the
commission's
finding
but
i'm
referring
to
the
testimony
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
that
supports
that
finding.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
the
actual.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
commission
is
correct.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true.
but
the
commission
also
found
that
unless
the
additional
--
unless
that
rail
service
was
instituted
promptly.
the
port
might
not
develop
at
all.
the
port
needed
the
railroad
if
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
needed
the
railroads
to
induce
great
lake
shippers
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
--
that
is
how
i
read
the
language
of
the
commission's
opinion
and
it
is
certainly
much
supporting
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
as
i
mention
originally
to
be
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
put
it
very
concretely.
there
was
evidence
that
a
great
lake
--
a
great
lake
shipper
will
not
pull
at
a
port
if
he
fears
inadequate
in
the
sense
of
inadequate
rail
service
in
the
sense
of
a
lack
of
competitive
rail
service.
he
will
choose
another
port
and
unless
lake
calumet
harbor
has
this
competitive
rail
service.
the
steamship
lines
are
going
to
stay
away
from
it.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
did
recognize
that
unless
and
stated
that
unless
this
additional
service
was
authorized
the
port
might
not
fulfill
its
promise.
these
steamship
companies
might
not
call
at
the
port
unless
is
assured
of
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
if
you
take
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
grain
merchants
say
located
in
the
iowa,
some
place
like
that.
he
has
a
great
number
of
places
of
ports
of
embarkation
for
here,
everywhere
from
new
orleans
to
new
york
to
great
lakes.
now,
as
purports
which
do
not
have
what
the
steamship
operators
require
at
--
regarded
at
the
grains
service,
the
ocean
rates
are
going
to
be
higher.
and
therefore
the
shipper
is
going
to
find
a
more
advantageous
rate
combination,
rail
plus
ocean
rates
elsewhere.
and
just
one
final
point
in
regard
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
questions
as
to
what
kind
of
evidence
the
commission
based
its
predictions
hereupon.
i
would
refer
you
to
pages
841
and
1065
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
that
is
the
testimony
of
two
professors.
one
for
the
applicants,
one
for
appellees
who
had
made
learned
studies
of
the
potentiality
of
the
port.
and
i
think
it
indicates
the
range
of
factors
which
the
commission
was
required
to
waive.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
moment,
i
shall
speak
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
appellees
were
denied
improperly
a
right
to
be
heard
on
these
applications.
but
i
like
to
take
just
one
moment
to
speak
to
mr.
justice
white's
point
about
the
staleness
of
the
record.
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
the
appellees
asked
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
number
of
documents,
reports
and
photographs
which
indicate
that
lake
calumet
harbor
has
grown
less
explosively
in
the
year
since
the
hearing
before
the
commission's
hearing
have
in
1957
that
some
of
the
witnesses
at
that
hearing
predicted.
and
it's
the
appellee's
argument
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
--
there
is
a
difference
there
which
i
want
to
mention
in
one
moment.
they
say
the
appellee
has
argued
that
there
should
be
a
remand
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
for
a
further
hearing
because
of
this
alleged
dullness.
but
first
i
like
to
suggest
that
the
allegations
as
to
the
failure
of
the
port
to
fulfill
to
the
completely
its
promise,
the
predictions
of
its
traffic
is
not
a
new
development
in
this
case
that
the
commission
had
no
opportunity
to
fail
to
consider
in
a
way
because
in
a
petition
for
reconsideration
filed
at
the
end
of
the
1962,
the
appellees
brought
to
the
commission's
attention,
statistics
showing
the
tonnage
in
freight
cars
handled
by
the
port
between
1957
and
1962,
and
again
argued
that
a
new
evidentiary
hearing
was
necessary.
now
the
commission
denied
that
petition
for
reconsideration
and
i
think
correctly
so,
in
this
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
the
first
place
returning
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
commission's
decision
in
which
it
approved
these
applications
had
never
relied
upon
the
highly
enthusiastic
projections
of
the
witnesses
in
the
hearing
such
as
the
general
manager
of
the
fourth
district
court
who
had
given
specific
tonnage
figures
which
he
expected
to
before
to
attain
in
given
years.
all
the
commission
is
fumed
as
a
predicate
for
its
conclusion
that
this
additional
service
should
be
authorized
was
that
the
port
had
excellent
long
range
prospects
for
growth
and
development.
and
as
to
this
general
projection
of
the
port's
growth
and
prosperity,
there
is
no
official
in
this
case.
the
appellees
witnesses
as
well
as
the
witnesses
for
the
applicant
railroads
agree
that
over
the
long
range,
the
port
would
grow.
now
in
the
second
place
and
perhaps
--and
more
pointedly,
the
commission
had
found
not
nearly
that
additional
rail
service
was
necessary
to
handle
the
increase
traffic
that
was
projected.
but
it
found
that
rail
service
was
necessary
to
induce
the
hope
for
expansion.
commission
emphasized
that
the
port
needed
this
rail
service
from
the
outset
of
its
development
if
there
was
to
be
development.
and
the
reason
is
simply
that
as
the
record
amply
demonstrates
competitive
and
adequate
rail
service
is
an
enormously
important
factor
in
a
port's
competitive
position.
it's
clear
that
lake
calumet
harbor
competes
with
a
great
many
ports
not
merely
great
lake
ports
and
other
ports
in
the
chicago
area
but
ports
on
a
gulf
coast,
the
atlantic
ocean.
and
if
lake
calumet
is
to
compete
successfully,
commission
found.
there
must
be
competitive
and
adequate
rail
service
and
to
give
just
one
example
of
why
this
is
so.
the
commission
stressed
that
an
important
element
of
the
promise
of
the
port
was
the
center
of
the
grain.
the
international
grain
trade
and
it
was
evidence
that
the
operators
of
the
large
ships
which
applied
this
trade
are
very
leery
about
calling
that
ports
where
there
may
be
delays
due
to
adequate
railroad
cost
supply
or
perhaps,
the
strike
against
the
rail
carrier.
other
conditions
which
are
--
which
tend
to
be
associated
with
the
single
line
rail
service.
are
these
delays
are
very
expensive
to
this
ship
operators.
they
also
often
disturbed
the
credit
transactions
under
which
this
trade
moves.
so
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
in
the
last
10
years
when
due
to
this
protract
of
litigation
lake
calumet
harbor
had
the
services
going
to
be
one
railroad.
its
growth
was
less
than
anticipated
and
this
development
confirms
rather
than
undermines
the
commission's
conclusion.
and
we
submit,
it's
not
a
ground
but
for
a
remand
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
but
i
--
i
assume
that
there
must
be
a
reason
for
believing
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
that
would
not
--
that
would
certainly
not
be
true
everywhere.
but
all
of
the
witnesses
agree
that
lake
calumet
harbor
had
some
unique
--
had
a
unique
potentiality.
it
is
not
just
another
port.
it
happens
to
be
a
strategically
situated
between
the
great
lakes
and
the
mississippi
river
and
its
right
near
the
chicago
area
which
is
a
great
industrial
center
and
it
was
believed
that
the
port
had
a
natural
potential
for
large
growth.
and
it
was
also
felt
that
additional
rail
service
was
needed
if
that
potential
was
to
be
realized.
i
mentioned
in
this
connection
that
the
commission
also
have
emphasize
how
anomalous
it
is
in
this
nation
for
a
major
public
port
facility,
like
lake
calumet
harbor
to
be
served
by
only
one
railroad.
the
evidence
showed
that
this
is
unusual
circumstance
for
a
harbor
of
this
cite
quite
apart
from
projections
of
increased
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
this
was
not
a
finding
based
merely
on
the
commission's
general
knowledge
of
the
railroad
industry.
the
port's
general
manager
and
other
witnesses
testified
that
there
were
delays
and
other
problems
this
--
and
higher
cost
associated
with
single
railroad
service
and
that
the
operators
of
the
ships
which
conduct
this
grain
trade
would
refuse
to
call
at
lake
calumet
harbor
for
this
reason.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
with
the
respect
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
once
it's
granted
that
competitive
rail
service
is
necessary.
i
should
think
that
the
number
of
railroads
to
be
admitted
would
depend
principally
on
whether
the
projected
traffic
was
capable
of
sustain
them.
if
as
the
commission
found
these
seven
railroads
can
operate
profitably
and
economically
there,
they
should
allow
to
get
an
additional
point.
and
that
is
that
these
seven
railroads
among
them
will
provide
direct
access
to
all
i
believe,
all
the
major
rail
carriers
that
would
be
serving
lake
calumet
harbor.
all
that
draws
from
the
grain
producing
regions.
i
also
might
mention
that
these
railroads
are
not
going
to
operate
helter-skelter
in
the
port
but
have
worked
out
an
agreement
for
coordinating
their
operations.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
this
has
all
been
held
up
by
this
litigation.
now,
i
should
like
to
devote
the
balance
of
my
time
to
the
second
issue
here.
mr.
o'brien
discussed
whether
that
public
interest
--
public
convince
a
necessity
present
or
future
requires
the
additional
rail
service
proposed
by
the
applicants
and
i
should
like
to
deal
with
contention
of
the
appellees
that
they
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
of
the
agreement
which
the
six
applicant
railroads
entered
into
with
the
chicago
regional
port
district.
that
is
the
public
authority
which
has
developed
and
which
administers
the
port
and
the
agreement
which
i
would
speak
from
that
in
that
which
govern
--
which
was
to
govern
the
use
of
the
10
or
so
miles
of
tracks
which
the
port
district
had
built
in
the
harbor
area
by
these
six
railroads.
and
if
the
court
will
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
a
moment,
i
think
i
can
define
the
issue
more
particularly
by
tracing
how
this
agreement
governing
the
use
of
the
tracks
came
into
the
case
and
was
dealt
with
by
the
commission.
now,
from
the
very
outset
of
the
proceeding
of
the
hearings
happen
in
1957.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
the
applicants
were
contemplating
service
within
the
court
itself
over
the
tracks
which
the
district
had
built
there,
a
use
of
tracks
which
would
of
course
require
the
district's
agreement.
the
applicants
were
not
interested
million
transporting
the
goods
and
to
and
from
the
district
line
but
of
--
obviously,
they
wanted
to
served
the
warehouses
and
grain
elevators
and
transit
shares
and
other
facilities
located
within
the
harbor
area
on
adjacent
to
tracks
which
the
port
district
had
built
for
this
purpose.
and
so,
agreement
was
regarded
from
the
beginning
as
an
essential
aspect
of
the
controversy.
it
was
introduced
into
the
record
and
it
was
subject
of
testimony
and
cross-examination.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
everyone
connected
with
the
proceeding
assumed
that
the
feasibility
of
the
arrangements
which
the
railroads
would
workout
with
the
port
district
was
an
essential
factor
and
whether
the
commission
should
grant
permission
for
the
additional
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
rock
island
operates
under
a
contract
with
the
port
district
under
which
it
pays
no
compensations
which
is
use.
i
shall
explain
its
arrangement
with
the
port
district
is
not
affected
by
the
agreement
which
the
applicants
made.
now
why
would
i
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
the
agreement
was
in
the
record
in
the
hearing
before
the
examiner
and
was
discussed
and
was
a
focal
point
of
controversy.
the
railroads,
the
applicant
railroads
had
not
asked
specifically
for
in
their
applications
for
express
authority
to
operate
over
the
port
district's
tracks.
they
didn't
do
that
because
there
was
a
question
whether
such
specific
authority
was
required.
one
reason
they
didn't
is
the
rock
island
under
the
contract
are
mention
by
mr.
justice
brennan
had
never
sought
the
commission
approval
feeling
the
--
that
that
was
not
necessary.
the
commission
however
found
that
the
original
applications
were
deficient
in
the
failing
to
request
this
authority
and
that
the
six
railroads
could
not
be
used
to
port
district's
tracks
unless
they
asked
for
authority
to
do
so
from
the
commission.
however,
the
commission
beamed
this
as
a
technical
deficiency
and
permitted
the
applicants
to
remedy
it
by
filing
a
supplemental
--
supplement
to
the
applications
or
supplemental
application
in
which
they
are
ask
for
this
authority.
and
the
commission
granted
the
application
without
a
further
hearing.
now
so
far
i
think,
there's
no
serious
question
of
a
denial
of
hearing
because
the
agreement
which
the
commission
approved
was
the
identical
one
was
wholly
immaterial
changes,
identical
to
the
one
that
has
been
in
the
record
--
in
the
proceeding
before
the
examiner.
however,
after
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
--
they
i
--
i
assume,
perhaps
been
correctly
that
the
original
application
was
that
the
supplement
to
the
application
was
served
--
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--served
on
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
on
the
appellee.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
but
in
any
event,
they
immediately
filed
this
--
had
throughout
this
proceeding
file
and
after
the
commission
approved
it
filed
and
objecting
document
and
the
commission
reaffirmed
its
determination
on
--
i
mean,
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
excuse
me
just
one
second.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
when
the
appellants
filed
their
supplement
in
the
application,
the
appellees
promptly
filed
a
document
to
strike
it
as
improper
and
made
a
number
of
contention
address
to
it.
so
they
did
have
to
applicants
we
have.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
now,
if
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
objected
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
this
approval.
but
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
these
suggestions
had
been
made
and
considered
in
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner.
so
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
new
evidence
that
require
additional
hearing.
as
i
say,
after
the
commission
approved
the
application
with
the
agreement
governing
the
use
these
tracks.
the
applicants
in
the
port
district
then
modified
the
agreement
and
the
commission
approved
the
modified
agreement
without
a
further
evidentiary
hearing,
although,
with
notice
--
full
notice
and
argument
for
the
appellees.
our
contention
however
is
that
that
this
modification
was
not
material.
it
did
not
raise
factual
issues
which
required
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now
the
modification,
the
only
even
arguably
material
modification,
there
were
small
changes
and
worthy
community
here
had
to
do
with
computation
of
the
rental
that
the
applicants
would
be
required
to
pay
the
port
district
to
use
this
10
miles
or
so
track
within
the
district.
now
in
the
original
agreement
at
which
i
repeat,
there
had
been
full
hearing,
full
canvassing
of
the
issues.
the
annual
rental
for
the
use
of
the
tracks
was
to
be
the
lower
of
two
figures.
the
first
of
this
was
5%
of
the
current
assessed
valuation
of
the
rail
facilities
in
the
district.
and
that
5%
figure
would
have
come
out
to
about
$35,000.00
per
year.
the
second
figure
was
to
be
computed
by
multiplying
the
number
of
cars
handled
to
or
from
the
district
in
a
year
including
locomotives
and
empty
cars
by
$2.00.
so
that
would
--
these
two
methods
of
computation
which
ever
produced
the
lower
rental
would
be
the
yearly
sum
due.
now
it's
finally
executed
and
approved
by
the
commission,
the
percentage
evaluation
term
which
i
say
would
have
come
out
to
that
$35,000.00
was
deleted.
and
the
rent
became
a
flat
per
car
rate
of
$2.00.
now,
there
was
some
change
in
the
definition
of
car
that
is
to
exclude
locomotives
and
most
empty
cars.
basically
the
new
rate
is
$2.00
per
revenue
car
loaded
or
partially
loaded.
so
what
the
question
of
a
right
to
a
hearing
boils
down
to,
is
whether
commission
was
required
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
this
change
in
rental
formula
might
so
undermined
the
ability
of
the
applicants
to
provide
a
--
an
economical
and
a
self-sustaining
service
that
the
application
should
be
denied.
now,
we
say
that
it
was
not
material.
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
that,
it
is
quite
obvious
to
the
commission
and
to
this
court,
the
railroad
industry
is
one
traditionally
played
by
very
heavy
fixed
costs
that
arriving
from
its
investment
in
tracks,
real
estate
and
engines,
and
repairs
shops
and
the
like.
and
whatever
fixed
cost
to
this
sort
of
large
part
of
total
costs.
the
value
of
the
business
that
affirmed
is
able
to
generate
becomes
critical
to
its
ability
to
make
money.
the
more
it
sells,
the
railroad
industry,
the
more
traffic
it
handles.
the
more
revenue
it
has
to
cover
these
heavy
fixed
costs
which
by
definition
remain
constant
while
the
traffic
increases.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
--
if
the
commission
originally
found.
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
railroads
to
be
paid
$2.00
per
car
whether
it's
a
volume
was
relatively
low
that
is
up
to
the
$35,000.00
percent
of
valuation
figure.
now
therefore,
it
must
be
reasonable
for
it
to
be
able
to
pay
at
the
same
rate
when
its
volume
increases.
now,
if
that
become
a
little
confusing,
let
me
restate
it
slightly.
under
the
old
agreement,
you
would
pay
$2.00
a
car
but
not
in
excess
of
the
5%
of
figure
is
$35,000.00.
so,
if
he
carried
17,000
cars
a
year.
you
would
pay
the
$2.00
rate,
$34,000.00.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
carry
20,000
cars,
you
would
pay
only
the
5%
figure
which
was
lower.
so
under
the
new
agreement
which
eliminates
this
5%
figure,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
total
rental
in
any
year
might
exceed
that
under
the
old
agreement.
if
they
carry
30,000
cars,
they
will
have
to
pay
$60,000.00
roughly.
but
as
i
say,
if
the
railroads
could
pay
these
$2.00
rates
when
volume
is
very
poor,
it's
down
on
the
2,000
or
3,000
cars
a
year
level.
they
should
certainly
be
able
to
pay
it
when
there
volume
is
good
because
if
their
traffic
is
heavy.
they
will
have
all
the
more
revenue
to
be
covering
there
heavy
fixed
cost
and
this
flat
$2.00
rate
will
be
less
burden
to
this
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
the
appellees
--
the
agreement
expressly
provides
that
it
shall
affect
any
rights
that
the
rock
island
railroad
might
have
under
its
preexisting
arrangements
with
the
district.
and
as
i
mentioned
it
currently
carries
the
cars
over
the
district
tracks
for
no
rental
payment.
now
it's
conceivable
that
the
district
will
in
the
future
sometime
want
to
receive
rental
from
the
rock
island
as
well
but
the
agreement
does
find
them
and
as
mr.
o'brien
pointed
out.
the
statement
in
the
dissenting
that
plan
that
the
appellees
were
somehow
being
subjected
to
an
agreement
which
that
not
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
is
utterly
without
foundation
in
the
record.
now
in
addition
to
what
--
it
seems
to
us
and
to
the
commission,
the
logic
of
the
situation.
why
this
change
in
the
rental
in
fact
that
was
immaterial?
commission
also
stated
and
i
think
with
considerable
foundation
that
in
general
it
is
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
accord
a
measure
of
difference
two
rentals
terms
which
had
been
fixed
by
arms
length
bargaining
between
the
--
between
parties
which
have
a
rough
equality
of
bargaining
power.
and
i
think
that
principle
is
particularly
valid
here
because
it's
quite
clear
that
the
port
district
does
not
have
an
interest
indulging
the
railroads
and
charging
them
a
rate
which
will
conclude
them
offering
a
self-sustaining
service.
as
i
mention,
the
port
district
has
allowed
the
rock
island
to
carry
cars
over
its
lines
at
no
rental
and
there's
--
let's
say
the
port
is
desperately
eager
to
a
track
adequate
rail
service.
it's
a
public
non-profit
body.
there's
no
reason
or
suppose
that
it
is
out
to
gouge
the
railroad
so
that
the
railroads
would
be
--
would
bind
themselves
to
an
exorbitant
rental.
and
just
to
touch
right
briefly
on
the
point
raise
by
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
bearing
of
the
universal
camera
case.
assuming
that
this
court,
eventhough,
this
is
a
direct
appeal
that
would
ordinarily
accord
a
measure
of
difference
to
the
district
court's
handling
of
the
factual
issues
here.
i
would
again
stress
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
this
majority
opinion
was
drafted
and
which
i
think
undermines
whatever
authority
it
would
other
applies
bring
with
it.
it
is
a
--
it
was
the
material
portions
on
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
issues
were
borrowed
verbatim
from
the
dissenting
opinion.
all
of
the
essentials
subsidiary
area
findings
of
the
commission
were
declared
by
the
majority
to
have
ample
--
to
have
substantial
support
in
the
record
and
all
--
and
in
essence
all
the
majority
did
was
to
insert
the
word
not
before
the
commission's
--
before
the
dissenting
page
conclusion
that
the
commission's
ultimate
findings
and
order
had
ample
support
in
the
record.
and
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
much
less
deference
is
due
the
majority
opinion.
and
in
conclusion
then,
we
urge
that
the
commission's
orders
here
both
insofar
as
they
approved
the
additional
rail
service
which
the
applicant
railroads
propose
and
also
insofar
as
they
approved
the
applicant's
arrangement
with
the
port
district
should
be
sustained,
and
without
any
further
hearings
to
delay
this
litigation
which
already
has
prevented
like
lake
calumet
harbor
from
realizing
its
potentials
for
these
10
years
of
litigating.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
return
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
for
a
moment.
the
form
of
agreement
between
the
applicant
railroads
and
the
port
district
was
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
original
hearing
before
the
hearing
examiner
and
its
term
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
excuse
me.
the
original
--
the
form
of
agreement
between
the
applicant
railroads
and
the
port
district
was
an
exhibit
in
the
record
before
the
hearing
examiner.
it
was
subject
to
testimony
and
to
cross-examination.
now,
they
finally
executed
agreement
was
not
subject
of
a
separate
evidentiary
hearing
and
as
i've
said
the
single
material
change
was
in
the
computation
of
the
rental
agreement
and
our
contention
is
simply
that
a
hearing
was
not
required
on
that
change
because
it
did
not
raised
a
serious
factual
question.
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
commission
had
made
an
expressed
finding
that
additional
rail
service
was
necessary
to
enable
the
port
to
realize
its
potential
and
at
page
310
of
the
printed
record
which
is
the
portion
of
the
commission's
report.
there
is
a
paragraph
dealing
with
this.
the
commission
states,
if
the
time
has
come
when
additional
rail
service
at
the
port
is
required
for
the
future
development
of
the
industries
now
or
hereafter
to
be
located
there
and
further
along
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
--
no.
i
would
put
the
emphasis
on
future
development
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
further
it
down
the
paragraph,
i
think
it
is
expressed
because
the
commission
says
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
310,
which
it
said,
it
would
be
a
detriment
and
hindrance
to
the
full
and
complete
development
of
lake
calumet
harbor
if
it
were
limited
to
the
service
of
the
single
railroad.
on
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
quite
that
way.
i
would
say
that,
railroad
--
additional
railroad
service
per
se
will
not
bring
additional
traffic
to
the
port.
but
the
potential
of
the
port
in
terms
of
its
location
and
facilities
to
induced
additional
traffic
depends
on
additional
rail
service.
additional
rail
service
is
a
necessary
although
not
as
sufficient
condition
to
induce
this
additional
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
i
don't
think
the
commission
found
that.
i
think
what
the
commission
found
was
that
the
opening
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
and
other
developments
would
attract
additional
service
to
the
port
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
was
certainly
the
commission's
belief
that
the
port
would
grow
and
would
have
addi
--
and
would
attract
more
service
so
that
these
additional
railroads
would
be
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
--
i
think
what
the
commission
is
saying
is,
there
will
be
more
traffic
in
business
but
unless
additional
service
is
authorize
now
at
the
outset
of
this
development.
the
development
may
not
materialize
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right.
there
are
many
great
lakes
ports.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true.
and
i
like
to
suggest
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct,
yes.
and
i
think
that
on
page
8
of
the
appellant
railroad's
brief,
there
is
a
list
of
record
citations
of
the
underline
evidence
which
supports
this
finding.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
--
that
is
the
commission's
finding
but
i'm
referring
to
the
testimony
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
that
supports
that
finding.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
the
actual.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
commission
is
correct.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true.
but
the
commission
also
found
that
unless
the
additional
--
unless
that
rail
service
was
instituted
promptly.
the
port
might
not
develop
at
all.
the
port
needed
the
railroad
if
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
needed
the
railroads
to
induce
great
lake
shippers
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
--
that
is
how
i
read
the
language
of
the
commission's
opinion
and
it
is
certainly
much
supporting
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
as
i
mention
originally
to
be
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
put
it
very
concretely.
there
was
evidence
that
a
great
lake
--
a
great
lake
shipper
will
not
pull
at
a
port
if
he
fears
inadequate
in
the
sense
of
inadequate
rail
service
in
the
sense
of
a
lack
of
competitive
rail
service.
he
will
choose
another
port
and
unless
lake
calumet
harbor
has
this
competitive
rail
service.
the
steamship
lines
are
going
to
stay
away
from
it.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
did
recognize
that
unless
and
stated
that
unless
this
additional
service
was
authorized
the
port
might
not
fulfill
its
promise.
these
steamship
companies
might
not
call
at
the
port
unless
is
assured
of
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
if
you
take
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
grain
merchants
say
located
in
the
iowa,
some
place
like
that.
he
has
a
great
number
of
places
of
ports
of
embarkation
for
here,
everywhere
from
new
orleans
to
new
york
to
great
lakes.
now,
as
purports
which
do
not
have
what
the
steamship
operators
require
at
--
regarded
at
the
grains
service,
the
ocean
rates
are
going
to
be
higher.
and
therefore
the
shipper
is
going
to
find
a
more
advantageous
rate
combination,
rail
plus
ocean
rates
elsewhere.
and
just
one
final
point
in
regard
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
questions
as
to
what
kind
of
evidence
the
commission
based
its
predictions
hereupon.
i
would
refer
you
to
pages
841
and
1065
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
that
is
the
testimony
of
two
professors.
one
for
the
applicants,
one
for
appellees
who
had
made
learned
studies
of
the
potentiality
of
the
port.
and
i
think
it
indicates
the
range
of
factors
which
the
commission
was
required
to
waive.
