justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
there
any
indication
in
this
record
that
the
--
that
the
history
of
the
growth
since
the
findings
were
made
is
different
from
the
predictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
district
court
may
have
thought
that
findings
was
just
plain
stale
and
so
far
the
line
of
actually
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
ought
to
be
a
new
record
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
this
evidence
the
case
close
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
o'brien,
is
that
what
you
have
thought
that
the
commission
should
have
held
another
hearing
on
the
ultimate
rate,
the
lease
rate
that
was
set?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
requested
something
that,
have
you
or
have
i
missed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
posner
is
going
to
talk
about
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
witnesses
testified
and
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
not
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
say
that
the
--
as
matter
of
law
the
commission
leaves
it
powers
or
authority
with
its
statutory
authority
if
it
issued
a
certificate
based
on
--
between
the
traffic
rather
than
the
present
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
this
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
interstate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
with
some
other
railroads?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
sir.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
is
the
support
fully
develop
now
in
the
sense
that
whatever
plans
they
worked
for
it
have
now
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
project
had
to
been
contemplated
in
some
10%
complete
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
thing
was
at
1957?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
i
--
i
must
confess
it's
a
complete
confusion.
what
mr.
posner
told
us,
one
of
the
problems
but
it
hasn't
got
beyond
10%.
if
it
gets
beyond
10%,
you
have
to
let
these
other
six
roads
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
is
ridiculous
in
terms
of
number
of
cars.
you
say
that
now
about
17,000
cars,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
everything
comes
in
on
rock
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
because
you
pick
up
any
traffic
of
those
roads
as
well
as
others
directed
to
the
port.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
things
are
moving
half
of
these
could
be
involved
that
they
have
michigan
attempts
not
the
only
competition
would
be
involved
is
that
competition
for
carriage
of
the
traffic
from
in
this
--
to
or
from
an
industry
inside
the
port
to
where
it
is
that
you
pick
up
this
simply
traffic
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
how
many
miles
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
60
miles
or
--
60
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
only
--
is
that
the
only
rate
of
constitution
that
you
really
thought
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
--
all
these
paints
all
about
is
to
do
--
has
the
great
privilege
of
carrying
within
the
district
at
some
rail
head
and
also
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
some
of
this
at
the
same
destination
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
right
now,
no
one
would
choose
to
have
sent
--
to
send
some
traffic
to
a
destination
you
serve
over
some
other
railroad
concerning
the
same
destination
because
it
has
to
be
a
switching
charge
with
and
delay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
long
as
you're
in
there,
you
got
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
got
an
operator
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
think
you
served.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
of
all
the
ports?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
this
isn't
just
a
question
of
carrying
a
harbor
not
being
able
to
compete
against
other
ports
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
--
which
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
ports
have
the
same
experience?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
may
have
been
rosy
predictions
other
ports
and
they
haven't
found
it
either
is
that
what
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
well,
how
do
you
know
then
that
this
isn't
calumet
harbor
its
effort?
and
it
just
walked
out
as
comparative
--
competitive
to
another
port.
mr.
posner's
point
is
that,
if
the
third
degree
of
traffic
is
important
--
is
an
important
factor
in
how
well
calumet
competes
with
other
ports
that
it
might
--
might
be
competing
for
the
same
traffic.
now,
you
can
state
calumet
harbor
didn't
had
--
had
been
very
well
that
maybe
true
but
what
if
it
is
after
that,
the
other
ports
have
been
well
and
calumet
harbor
just
lost
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trouble
is
that
none
of
this
--
in
the
record
material
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
ask
to
say
--
didn't
ask
the
icc
to
take
notice
of
the
same
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
say
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
why
should
we
second
guess
the
icc
on
the
relevance
or
the
significance
of
this
kind
of
information
that's
been
there
business
to
deal
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
exactly
what
you
ask
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
shouldn't
you
ask
them
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
asking
us
the
same
as
you
ask
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
asking
us
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
defining
the
district
court
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
walk
out
here
victory,
you
know.
what
you
were
hearing
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
further
hearings
on
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
--
now,
the
icc
is
a
--
had
a
--
the
interesting
to
this
before
the
--
you
file
with
this
for
the
reconsiderations
on
its
basis?
can
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
the
--what
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
up
here
and
each
stage
of
the
icc
look
at
your
evidence,
listen
to
all
this
and
said
it
wasn't
surmise
then
and
this
isn't
surmise
now
apparently.
they
don't
really
agree
with
you
on
a
significant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
icc
have
to
reappraised
this
particular
evidence
to
say
the
icc
really
doesn't
want
us
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
know
what
they're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
they
did
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
really
didn't
know
what
they're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
definitely
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
mr.
desch
you
told
us
amicus
that
finding
as
the
future
was
based
purely
on
conjecture
etcetera,
etcetera.
but
precisely
what
was
the
nature
of
the
evidence
without
label?
i
know
mr.
posner
told
us
something
of
predictions
by
the
general
manager
of
the
port,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
mr.
o'brien
mentioned
the
head
of
some
very
large
terminal
company
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
what
you
said,
but
what
other
other
evidence
besides
those
two,
is
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
same
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
gather
that
mr.
posner
made
this
argument
that
this
is
one
of
the
basis
--
one
of
the
basis
for
the
--
one
of
the
means
for
the
commission
action.
they
needed
competitive
service
to
generate
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
expected
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
say
it
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't
a
finding
then
if
it
is
not
that
--
that
you
mean
competitive
service
to
generate
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
this
finding
mr.
desch,
its
page
1411
of
the
record?
beginning
with
some
indications
that
suit
the
traffic
etcetera?
isn't
that
that
in
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
at
1411
is
in
fact
one
those
did
they
found
supported
by
substantial
support
in
record,
yes.
the
one
beginning
with
some
indications
to
future
traffic
do
the
port
maybe
determined
from
the
business
generated
maybe
its
half
it
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
the
kind
of
finding
that
mr.
posner
was
addressing
himself
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
support
the
ultimate
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
--
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
the
earlier
findings
which
deal
with
the
past
and
then
as
i
understand
this
finding
at
1411.
that
in
fact
is
a
prediction
of
the
future
rested
on
these
findings
that
proceeded
as
the
past
business
of
the
growth
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway,
the
new
york
said
there
going
in
there.
the
tonnage
they
previously
carried.
what
they're
now
be
able
to
do
able
with
ships
that
exceeds
258
deep
and
vessels
400
to
450
feet
length
and
so
forth.
and
was
this
a
prediction
base
on
that
sort
of
thing
that
this
much
then
give
larger
business
to
the
court
provided
there
was
competitive
rail
service
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
you're
saying
anyway
is
--
whatever
the
evidence
maybe
it's
in
those
findings
beginning
at
1409
up
to
1411
which
preceded?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
those
were
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
just
take
me
on
this
if
not
you're
the
only
railroad
in
there,
now
if
the
company
--
if
the
company
grains
(inaudible),
i
suppose
that
there's
one
place
--
when
you
put
it
that's
on
a
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
company
is
to
compete
for
that
company,
once
they
put
in
there,
could
the
railroads
really
historically
have
railroads
subjected
to
sell
their
lands
to
competitors
of
their
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
got
300
--
did
you
got
300
acres
of
ground
up
there
that
i
supposed
you
sell
to
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
wouldn't
have
any
reluctance
at
all
to
set
up
a
competitor
that
one
of
your
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
the
way
it
is
that
the
ports
could
have
land
to
sell
that
i
can
invest
to
for
the
lease
in
the
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you're
not
the
only
source
of
land
wherein
industrial
locations
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
the
other
railroads
never
would
be
--
they
came
in
here
all
--
that
they
would
not
the
only
land,
would
they?
they
would
just
have
package
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
only
would
the
overall
of
the
--
so
that
we
need
a
regulating
the
industrial
development
is
up
to
the
port
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it's
on
the
area
(inaudible)
one
way
would
be
used
to
state
an
evidence
as
to
the
future
of
this
case
would
be
the
port
district
would
issue
more
bonds
and
build
more
terminals,
and
warehouses,
and
all
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
you
on
the
terminal
have
land
for
that
purpose
within
--
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
taken
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
it
increase
in
the
number
of
railroads,
would
increase
the
business
traveling
through
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
emphasis
is
on
the
hereafter?
justice
byron
r.
white
inferentially,
they
found
what
you
said.
that
doesn't
say
so
it's
expressly
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
posner,
what
about
that
last
sentence
that
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
310?
considering
all
of
circumstance
in
these
proceeding,
technically
the
expansion
program
now
on
progress
of
the
port
and
the
increase
amount
of
rail
traffic
to
be
made
available
at
the
port.
we
are
of
the
opinion
of
the
additional
service
of
the
application
was
going,
what's
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
--
can
it
be
read
and
--
i
must
say
although
i
have
this
difficulty
so
often
with
the
icc
thing
to
prove.
can
that
be
read
as
saying
there's
going
to
be
an
increase
amount
of
rail
traffic
necessary
for
all
these
other
reasons
to
this
port.
and
one
railroad
can
handle
it
and
therefore,
we
got
six
more?
may
that
be
read
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
lake
calumet?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
st.
lawrence,
this
is
the
only
entrance,
the
only
way
to
the
st.
lawrence
seaway,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
lake
calumet
wants
--
there's
going
to
be
more
traffic
moving
on
the
seaways?
justice
byron
r.
white
than
there
ever
has
been
and
if
calumet
wants
to
carry
its
share,
it
better
get
some
more
railroads,
is
that
what
it
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
more
than
those
that
i
have
referred
to
earlier
mr.
posner,
at
14
or
is
it
1409
to
1411
of
the
opinions
still
more
than
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
the
actual
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
1065
of
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
there
any
indication
in
this
record
that
the
--
that
the
history
of
the
growth
since
the
findings
were
made
is
different
from
the
predictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
district
court
may
have
thought
that
findings
was
just
plain
stale
and
so
far
the
line
of
actually
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
ought
to
be
a
new
record
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
this
evidence
the
case
close
before
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
o'brien,
is
that
what
you
have
thought
that
the
commission
should
have
held
another
hearing
on
the
ultimate
rate,
the
lease
rate
that
was
set?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
requested
something
that,
have
you
or
have
i
missed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
posner
is
going
to
talk
about
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
witnesses
testified
and
the
commission
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
not
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
say
that
the
--
as
matter
of
law
the
commission
leaves
it
powers
or
authority
with
its
statutory
authority
if
it
issued
a
certificate
based
on
--
between
the
traffic
rather
than
the
present
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
this
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
interstate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
with
some
other
railroads?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
sir.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
is
the
support
fully
develop
now
in
the
sense
that
whatever
plans
they
worked
for
it
have
now
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
project
had
to
been
contemplated
in
some
10%
complete
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
thing
was
at
1957?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
i
--
i
must
confess
it's
a
complete
confusion.
what
mr.
posner
told
us,
one
of
the
problems
but
it
hasn't
got
beyond
10%.
if
it
gets
beyond
10%,
you
have
to
let
these
other
six
roads
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
is
ridiculous
in
terms
of
number
of
cars.
you
say
that
now
about
17,000
cars,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
everything
comes
in
on
rock
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
because
you
pick
up
any
traffic
of
those
roads
as
well
as
others
directed
to
the
port.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
things
are
moving
half
of
these
could
be
involved
that
they
have
michigan
attempts
not
the
only
competition
would
be
involved
is
that
competition
for
carriage
of
the
traffic
from
in
this
--
to
or
from
an
industry
inside
the
port
to
where
it
is
that
you
pick
up
this
simply
traffic
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
how
many
miles
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
60
miles
or
--
60
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
only
--
is
that
the
only
rate
of
constitution
that
you
really
thought
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
--
all
these
paints
all
about
is
to
do
--
has
the
great
privilege
of
carrying
within
the
district
at
some
rail
head
and
also
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
some
of
this
at
the
same
destination
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
right
now,
no
one
would
choose
to
have
sent
--
to
send
some
traffic
to
a
destination
you
serve
over
some
other
railroad
concerning
the
same
destination
because
it
has
to
be
a
switching
charge
with
and
delay
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
long
as
you're
in
there,
you
got
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
got
an
operator
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
think
you
served.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
of
all
the
ports?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
this
isn't
just
a
question
of
carrying
a
harbor
not
being
able
to
compete
against
other
ports
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
--
which
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
ports
have
the
same
experience?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
may
have
been
rosy
predictions
other
ports
and
they
haven't
found
it
either
is
that
what
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
well,
how
do
you
know
then
that
this
isn't
calumet
harbor
its
effort?
and
it
just
walked
out
as
comparative
--
competitive
to
another
port.
mr.
posner's
point
is
that,
if
the
third
degree
of
traffic
is
important
--
is
an
important
factor
in
how
well
calumet
competes
with
other
ports
that
it
might
--
might
be
competing
for
the
same
traffic.
now,
you
can
state
calumet
harbor
didn't
had
--
had
been
very
well
that
maybe
true
but
what
if
it
is
after
that,
the
other
ports
have
been
well
and
calumet
harbor
just
lost
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trouble
is
that
none
of
this
--
in
the
record
material
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
ask
to
say
--
didn't
ask
the
icc
to
take
notice
of
the
same
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
say
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
why
should
we
second
guess
the
icc
on
the
relevance
or
the
significance
of
this
kind
of
information
that's
been
there
business
to
deal
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
exactly
what
you
ask
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
shouldn't
you
ask
them
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
asking
us
the
same
as
you
ask
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
asking
us
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
defining
the
district
court
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
walk
out
here
victory,
you
know.
what
you
were
hearing
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
further
hearings
on
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
--
now,
the
icc
is
a
--
had
a
--
the
interesting
to
this
before
the
--
you
file
with
this
for
the
reconsiderations
on
its
basis?
can
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
the
--what
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
up
here
and
each
stage
of
the
icc
look
at
your
evidence,
listen
to
all
this
and
said
it
wasn't
surmise
then
and
this
isn't
surmise
now
apparently.
they
don't
really
agree
with
you
on
a
significant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
icc
have
to
reappraised
this
particular
evidence
to
say
the
icc
really
doesn't
want
us
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
know
what
they're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
they
did
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
really
didn't
know
what
they're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
definitely
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
mr.
desch
you
told
us
amicus
that
finding
as
the
future
was
based
purely
on
conjecture
etcetera,
etcetera.
but
precisely
what
was
the
nature
of
the
evidence
without
label?
i
know
mr.
posner
told
us
something
of
predictions
by
the
general
manager
of
the
port,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
mr.
o'brien
mentioned
the
head
of
some
very
large
terminal
company
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
what
you
said,
but
what
other
other
evidence
besides
those
two,
is
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
same
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
gather
that
mr.
posner
made
this
argument
that
this
is
one
of
the
basis
--
one
of
the
basis
for
the
--
one
of
the
means
for
the
commission
action.
they
needed
competitive
service
to
generate
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
expected
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
say
it
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't
a
finding
then
if
it
is
not
that
--
that
you
mean
competitive
service
to
generate
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
this
finding
mr.
desch,
its
page
1411
of
the
record?
beginning
with
some
indications
that
suit
the
traffic
etcetera?
isn't
that
that
in
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
at
1411
is
in
fact
one
those
did
they
found
supported
by
substantial
support
in
record,
yes.
the
one
beginning
with
some
indications
to
future
traffic
do
the
port
maybe
determined
from
the
business
generated
maybe
its
half
it
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
the
kind
of
finding
that
mr.
posner
was
addressing
himself
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
support
the
ultimate
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
--
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
the
earlier
findings
which
deal
with
the
past
and
then
as
i
understand
this
finding
at
1411.
that
in
fact
is
a
prediction
of
the
future
rested
on
these
findings
that
proceeded
as
the
past
business
of
the
growth
of
the
st.
lawrence
seaway,
the
new
york
said
there
going
in
there.
the
tonnage
they
previously
carried.
what
they're
now
be
able
to
do
able
with
ships
that
exceeds
258
deep
and
vessels
400
to
450
feet
length
and
so
forth.
and
was
this
a
prediction
base
on
that
sort
of
thing
that
this
much
then
give
larger
business
to
the
court
provided
there
was
competitive
rail
service
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
you're
saying
anyway
is
--
whatever
the
evidence
maybe
it's
in
those
findings
beginning
at
1409
up
to
1411
which
preceded?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
those
were
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
just
take
me
on
this
if
not
you're
the
only
railroad
in
there,
now
if
the
company
--
if
the
company
grains
(inaudible),
i
suppose
that
there's
one
place
--
when
you
put
it
that's
on
a
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
company
is
to
compete
for
that
company,
once
they
put
in
there,
could
the
railroads
really
historically
have
railroads
subjected
to
sell
their
lands
to
competitors
of
their
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
got
300
--
did
you
got
300
acres
of
ground
up
there
that
i
supposed
you
sell
to
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
wouldn't
have
any
reluctance
at
all
to
set
up
a
competitor
that
one
of
your
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
the
way
it
is
that
the
ports
could
have
land
to
sell
that
i
can
invest
to
for
the
lease
in
the
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you're
not
the
only
source
of
land
wherein
industrial
locations
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
the
other
railroads
never
would
be
--
they
came
in
here
all
--
that
they
would
not
the
only
land,
would
they?
they
would
just
have
package
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
only
would
the
overall
of
the
--
so
that
we
need
a
regulating
the
industrial
development
is
up
to
the
port
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it's
on
the
area
(inaudible)
one
way
would
be
used
to
state
an
evidence
as
to
the
future
of
this
case
would
be
the
port
district
would
issue
more
bonds
and
build
more
terminals,
and
warehouses,
and
all
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
you
on
the
terminal
have
land
for
that
purpose
within
--
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
taken
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
it
increase
in
the
number
of
railroads,
would
increase
the
business
traveling
through
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
emphasis
is
on
the
hereafter?
justice
byron
r.
white
inferentially,
they
found
what
you
said.
that
doesn't
say
so
it's
expressly
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
posner,
what
about
that
last
sentence
that
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
310?
considering
all
of
circumstance
in
these
proceeding,
technically
the
expansion
program
now
on
progress
of
the
port
and
the
increase
amount
of
rail
traffic
to
be
made
available
at
the
port.
we
are
of
the
opinion
of
the
additional
service
of
the
application
was
going,
what's
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
--
can
it
be
read
and
--
i
must
say
although
i
have
this
difficulty
so
often
with
the
icc
thing
to
prove.
can
that
be
read
as
saying
there's
going
to
be
an
increase
amount
of
rail
traffic
necessary
for
all
these
other
reasons
to
this
port.
and
one
railroad
can
handle
it
and
therefore,
we
got
six
more?
may
that
be
read
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
lake
calumet?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
st.
lawrence,
this
is
the
only
entrance,
the
only
way
to
the
st.
lawrence
seaway,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
lake
calumet
wants
--
there's
going
to
be
more
traffic
moving
on
the
seaways?
justice
byron
r.
white
than
there
ever
has
been
and
if
calumet
wants
to
carry
its
share,
it
better
get
some
more
railroads,
is
that
what
it
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
more
than
those
that
i
have
referred
to
earlier
mr.
posner,
at
14
or
is
it
1409
to
1411
of
the
opinions
still
more
than
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
the
actual
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
