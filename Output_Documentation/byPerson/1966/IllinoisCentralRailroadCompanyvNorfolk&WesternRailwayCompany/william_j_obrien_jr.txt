mr.

o'brien,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
reports
and
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
granting
authority
to
six
railroads
whom
i
represent
to
extend
their
lines
and
operations
to
serve
the
facilities
of
the
principal
customers
and
shippers
of
the
rock
island
railroad
at
lake
calumet
harbor
in
chicago,
illinois
which
customers
and
shippers
i
also
represent.
the
case
presents
two
issues.
i
shall
treat
with
the
primary
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
support
in
the
evidence
to
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
commission.
and
mr.
posner,
the
department
of
justice
will
treat
with
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rock
island
was
denied
due
process
of
law
when
the
commission
refused
to
grant
further
hearings
in
the
case.
at
the
outset
let
me
say
that
this
is
not
a
merely
confined
to
the
rock
island
and
the
six
railroads
but
it
is
a
case
of
the
six
railroads
wishing
to
serve
the
port
and
the
principal
shippers
at
lake
calumet
wanting
these
railroads
to
serve
the
port
on
a
one
side
and
the
rock
island,
the
sole
railroad
serving
the
port
on
the
other.
a
statutory
three-judge
district
court
in
cleveland,
ohio,
as
one
judge
dissenting
held
it
was
not
ample
support
in
the
record
for
the
conclusions
of
the
commission
and
they
should
injunction
permanently
restraining
the
commission
from
putting
its
orders
into
effect.
at
the
same
time
the
court
found
there
is
substantial
support
in
the
evidence
with
the
major
findings
of
the
commission.
and
these
findings
your
honors,
we
respectfully
submit
in
adopting
themselves
would
justify
the
granting
of
a
certificate
by
the
commission.
appellants,
applicants
before
the
commission
and
intervening
shippers
seek
to
have
this
injunction
dissolved
in
order
that
the
observers
proposed
which
the
commission
found
to
be
required
in
the
future
public
convenience
necessity
might
be
initiated
and
accelerated.
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
the
district
courts
and
the
rock
island
would
write
out
from
section
1,
paragraph
18
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
word
“future”.
that
act
in
substance
through
that
portion
in
the
act
in
substance
provides
that,
“no
railroad
shall
extend
its

or
its

a
certificate
of
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
the

in
the
light
of

by

and
public
officials
in
the
light
of
the
findings
of
the

the
court
including
the
dissenting
opinion.
it's
difficult
to
understand
the
opinion
and
order
of
the
district
court
which
is
carefully
inconsistent
and
contradictory.
when
the
applications
were
filed
with
the
commission
approximately
10
years
ago,
the
appellants
sought
to
prove
and
did
so
to
force
the
examiners
satisfaction
and
later
the
commission
satisfaction
that
the
service
proposed
by
the
railroads
would
aide
in
the
development
of
the
court,
at
port,
excuse
me.
the
commission
found
and
the
courts
said,
there
were
substantial
support
in
the
record
to
the
finding
that
lake
calumet
harbor
is
located
and
one
of
the
heaviest
industrial
areas
in
the
world.
that
presents
one
of
the
greatest
potentials
for
the
generating
of
traffic
in
the
country.
that
is
the
major
port
of
the
port
of
chicago.
the
major
deep
water
port
of
the
port
of
chicago
and
it
is
located
in
chicago
as
the
heart
of
chicago's
railroad
switching
district.
the
port
of
chicago
was
then
the
major
great
lake's
general
cargo
port
and
in
1959
was
to
become
a
dominant
gateway
for
export
grain.
this
property
is
publicly
owned
and
as
leased
to
individual
operators
by
the
chicago
regional
port
district,
individual
operators
like
appellants
here.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
over
$24
million
have
been
spent
on
the
initial
development
of
lake
calumet
harbor
including
the
construction
of
grain
elevators,
public
warehouses,
cold
storage
plants,
transit
sheds,
trucking
terminals,
and
14
miles
of
railroad
tracks.
additional
basic
findings
for

the
court
held

is
however

with
the

the
commission
found
and
the
court
had
a
substantial
support
in

for

regarding
future

but
what
the
commission
found
and
the
court
against
it.
there
was
substantial
support
in
the

for
the
finding

base
of
the
testimony
of

of

in

to
the

of

these
are
the
conclusions

commission
which
are

expertise
of

are
not

and
yet
that
court
without
further
ado
after
reviewing
the
conclusions
of
the
commission
said
there
is
not
support
in
the
evidence
for
such
findings,
the

that
we
have
on

7
and

of

the

it's

for

mr.

jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
just
prior
to
a
recess
you
asked
if
there
was
a
unity
of
expression
by
the
judges
of
that
particular
point
and
as
far
as
the
basic
findings
of
the
court
of
the
commission
were
concern
very
unanimous
that
there
was
substantial
support.
but
then
when
it
anyone
that
came
to
the
conclusions,
the
dissenting
opinions
said
that
there
was
basis
for

basic
support
for
the
conclusions
of
the
commission.
but
the
dissenting
of

or
the
majority
opinion
held
that
there
was
not
ample
support
to
the
conclusion.
mr.
william

you
just
said
what
i'm
about
to
say
mr.
justice

incredible
as
it
may
appear
the

from

including
the
recitation
of

and
even
citations
of
the
decisions
of
this

it
is
evident
to
the

of
the

did
not

decisions
of
this

which
were
lifted

from

as

versus

and
schaffer

company
versus

where
in
this
court
said
that
congress
empowered
the
commission
to
grant
authority
to
construct
new
lines
to
create
competitive
service
if
and
when
it
should
find
that
it
necessary
and
convenient
in
the
future
and

that
no

is
entitled
to
protection
from
competition
if
the

or
future
public

wants
that
additional
service.
these
cases
which
we
had
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
the

have
decided,
were
cited
by
the

presumably
in

conclusion.
the
district
court
misconceived
not
only
its
own
--
the
effect
of
the
commission's
action
but
its
own
function.
it
is
obvious
the
district
court
told
it
was
the
chief
arbiter
of
the
paramount
public
interest
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
clearly
state
that
this
is
the
office
of
the
commission.
the
district
court
is
limited
to
ascertaining
whether
or
not
there
is
warrant
in
the
facts
in
law
for
the
action
of
the
commission.
the
judicial
function
that
court
was
exhausted
when
it
found
that
there
was
ample
support
in
the
record
for
the
--
the
findings
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
size
and
capacity
of
lake
calumet
of
its
future
transportation
needs
and
the
capacity
of
the
applicants.
when
it
made
those
findings
--
when
it
stated
that
there
was
ample
support
to
those
findings,
its
tasks
was
finished.
the
rock
island
and
briefs
cites
commission
cases
were
in
relief
was
denied
in
certain
application
cases.
this
of
course
is
the
office
of
the
commission
to
deny
applications
where
findings
supporting
the
granting
of
an
application
to
that
type
are
missing.
if
its
here
to
commission
finds
that
there
is
evidence
to

to
support
a
finding
that
public
convenience
fu
--
present
or
future
public
convenience
to
the
necessity
warrants
the
granting
on
application.
the
court
is
powerless
to
step
in
and
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
as
long
as
there
is
warrant
in
the
facts
in
the
applicable
law.
what
the

or
future

requiring
the

a
matter
which
has
been
left
by

to
the

of

labels
the
commission's
finding
with
respect
to
a
future

as
based
upon
conjecture,
highly
speculative.
this
is
the
same
rock
island
on
brief
and
then
again,
before
the
district
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“we
purchased
the

the
conviction
that

someday
be

this
is

its

upon
all
the

with

that

in

stressed
that

to
the
fact
that
they
have
received
complaints
in
1955,
1956
and
1957.
the
other
warehouse
operators
lake
calumet
testified
that
they
agreed
with
the
present
north
pier
terminal
when
he
testified
that
actually
there
service
left
something
to
be
desired.
that
they
had
complained
continually
but
at
the
service
had
improved
and
he
was
asked
when
the
service
improved.
and
he
said
when
this
case
would
docket?
when
this
case
docketed?
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
opinion
in
order
that
district
court
and
remand
to
that
court
with
the
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
yes,
i
do
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words,
the
whole
evidence
should
be
taken
in
consideration
and
our
whole
evidence
here
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
basic
findings,
the
findings
of
the
commission
are
have
been
found
they
have
support
in
the
record
and
there
are
--
the
chesapeake
on
ohio
case,
the
schaffer
transportation
case,
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
which
state
that
the
district
court
has
no
right
to
substitute
its
opinion
as
long
as
he
find
--
they
made
differ
from
the
conclusion
rates.
but
as
long
as
there
support
in
the
record
for
findings
of
the
commission,
they
cannot
change
that
conclusion.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
was
thinking
of
the
defense
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
have
--
the
general
principle
of
the
universal
camera
case
as
i
understand
it
is
that
all
the
evidence,
the
total
evidence
should
be
considered.
i
really
feel
that
there
are
other
cases
closer
to
point
in
that.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that's
inconsistent.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
no,
i
never
say
--
i
don't
--
i
believe
there
are
other
cases
mr.
justice
black
that
--
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
no,
mr.
posner,
counsel
of
the
department
of
justice
will.
i
may
add
this
one
particular
point.
i'm
going
over
the
last
night
again
i
read
the
dissenting
opinion
as
well
as
the
majority
opinion.
and
there
is
one
statement
in
there
where
judge
edwards
was
of
the
impression
that
this
new
contract
that
the
agreement
between
--
the
lease
agreement
between
the
ports
and
the
railroads
have
not
been
the
subject
of
interrogation
at
the
original
hearing.
but
actually
if
--
it
was
the
subject
of
interrogation
and
as
matter
of
fact
you
can
find
that
on
pages
798,
802
of
the
record.
and
i
believe
that
is
the
only
place
were
it
lead
--
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
yes,
he
is
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
reports
and
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
granting
authority
to
six
railroads
whom
i
represent
to
extend
their
lines
and
operations
to
serve
the
facilities
of
the
principal
customers
and
shippers
of
the
rock
island
railroad
at
lake
calumet
harbor
in
chicago,
illinois
which
customers
and
shippers
i
also
represent.
the
case
presents
two
issues.
i
shall
treat
with
the
primary
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
support
in
the
evidence
to
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
commission.
and
mr.
posner,
the
department
of
justice
will
treat
with
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rock
island
was
denied
due
process
of
law
when
the
commission
refused
to
grant
further
hearings
in
the
case.
at
the
outset
let
me
say
that
this
is
not
a
merely
confined
to
the
rock
island
and
the
six
railroads
but
it
is
a
case
of
the
six
railroads
wishing
to
serve
the
port
and
the
principal
shippers
at
lake
calumet
wanting
these
railroads
to
serve
the
port
on
a
one
side
and
the
rock
island,
the
sole
railroad
serving
the
port
on
the
other.
a
statutory
three-judge
district
court
in
cleveland,
ohio,
as
one
judge
dissenting
held
it
was
not
ample
support
in
the
record
for
the
conclusions
of
the
commission
and
they
should
injunction
permanently
restraining
the
commission
from
putting
its
orders
into
effect.
at
the
same
time
the
court
found
there
is
substantial
support
in
the
evidence
with
the
major
findings
of
the
commission.
and
these
findings
your
honors,
we
respectfully
submit
in
adopting
themselves
would
justify
the
granting
of
a
certificate
by
the
commission.

applicants
before
the
commission
and
intervening
shippers

to
have
this
injunction

that
the

which
the
commission
found
to
be
required
in
the
future

convenience

might
be
initiated
and
accelerated.
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress,
the
district
courts
and
the
rock
island
would
write
out
from
section
1,
paragraph
18
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
word
“future”.
that
act
in
substance
through
that
portion
in
the

provides
that,
“no

in
the
light

officials
in
the
light
of
the
findings
of
the

the
court
including
the
dissenting
opinion.
it's
difficult
to
understand
the
opinion
and
order
of
the
district
court
which
is
carefully
inconsistent
and
contradictory.
when
the
applications
were
filed
with
the
commission
approximately
10
years
ago,
the
appellants
sought
to
prove
and
did
so
to
force
the
examiners
satisfaction
and
later
the
commission
satisfaction
that
the
service
proposed
by
the
railroads
would
aide
in
the
development
of
the
court,
at
port,
excuse
me.
the
commission
found
and
the
courts
said,
there
were
substantial
support
in
the
record
to
the
finding
that
lake
calumet
harbor
is
located
and
one
of
the
heaviest
industrial
areas
in
the
world.
that
presents
one
of
the
greatest
potentials
for
the
generating
of
traffic
in

country.
that
is

port
of

port
of
the

of

and
it
is
located
in
chicago
as
the
heart
of
chicago's
railroad

the
port
of
chicago
was
then
the
major
great
lake's
general
cargo
port
and
in
1959
was
to
become
a
dominant
gateway
for

property
is
publicly
owned
and
as
leased
to
individual
operators
by
the
chicago
regional
port
district,
individual
operators
like
appellants
here.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
over
$24
million
have
been
spent
on
the
initial
development
of
lake
calumet
harbor
including
the
construction
of
grain
elevators,
public
warehouses,
cold
storage
plants,
transit
sheds,
trucking
terminals,
and
14
miles
of
railroad
tracks.
additional
basic
findings
for

the
commission
found

what
the

found
and
the

against
it.
there
was
substantial
support
in
the
record
for
the
finding

of
the
testimony
of

are
the
conclusions

are

expertise
of

are
not

and
yet
that
court
without
further
ado
after
reviewing
the
conclusions
of
the
commission
said
there
is
not
support
in
the
evidence
for
such
findings,
the
citation

that
we
have
on
pages
7
and
8
of

complete
support

findings,
and
the

not
and

mr.

it's
time
for
your
chairman.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,

alright.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
just
prior
to
a
recess
you
asked
if
there
was
a
unity
of
expression
by
the
judges
of
that
particular
point
and
as
far
as
the
basic
findings
of
the
court
of
the
commission
were
concern
very
unanimous
that
there
was
substantial
support.
but
then
when
it
anyone
that
came
to
the
conclusions,
the
dissenting
opinions
said
that
there
was
basis
for

basic
support
for
the
conclusions
of
the
commission.
but
the
dissenting
of
--
or
the
majority
opinion
held
that
there
was
not
ample
support
to
the
conclusion.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
you
just
said
what
i'm
about
to
say
mr.
justice
harlan.
incredible
as
it
may
appear
the

from

including
the
recitation
of

and
even
citations
of
the
decisions
of
this

it
is
evident
to
the

of
the

did
not
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
were
lifted
verbatim
from

such
as
chesapeake
and
ohio
railway
versus
united

and
schaffer
transportation
company
versus
united

where
in
this
court
said
that
congress
empowered
the
commission
to
grant
authority
to
construct
new
lines
to
create
competitive
service
if
and
when
it
should
find
that
it
necessary
and
convenient
in
the
future
and
present
public

and
that
no
carrier
is
entitled
to
protection
from
competition
if
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
wants
that
additional
service.
these
cases
which
we
had
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
the

opinion
--

have
decided,
were
cited
by
the
majority
presumably
in

conclusion.
the
district
court
misconceived
not
only
its
own
--
the
effect
of
the
commission's
action
but
its
own
function.
it
is
obvious
the
district
court
told
it
was
the
chief
arbiter
of
the
paramount
public
interest
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
clearly
state
that
this
is
the
office
of
the
commission.
the
district
court
is
limited
to
ascertaining
whether
or
not
there
is
warrant
in
the
facts
in
law
for
the
action
of
the
commission.
the
judicial
function
that
court
was
exhausted
when
it
found
that
there
was
ample
support
in
the
record
for
the
--
the
findings
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
size
and
capacity
of
lake
calumet
of
its
future
transportation
needs
and
the
capacity
of
the
applicants.
when
it
made
those
findings
--
when
it
stated
that
there
was
ample
support
to
those
findings,
its
tasks
was
finished.
the
rock
island
and
briefs
cites
commission
cases
were
in
relief
was
denied
in
certain
application
cases.
this
of
course
is
the
office
of
the
commission
to
deny
applications
where
findings
supporting
the
granting
of
an
application
to
that
type
are
missing.
if
its
here
to
commission
finds
that
there
is
evidence
to
port
--
to
support
a
finding
that
public
convenience
fu
--
present
or
future
public
convenience
to
the
necessity
warrants
the
granting
on
application.
the
court
is
powerless
to
step
in
and
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
as
long
as
there
is
warrant
in
the
facts
in
the
applicable
law.
what
the
present
or
future

requiring
the
premise
is
a
matter
which
has
been
left
by
congress
to
the
informed
judgment
of
the
commission.
rock
island
labels
the
commission's
finding
with
respect
to
a
future
traffic
as
based
upon
conjecture,
highly
speculative.
this
is
the
same
rock
island
on
brief
and
then
again,
before
the
district
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“we
purchased
the
pullman
railroad
upon
the
conviction
that
lake
calumet
harbor
would
someday
be
an
international
port.
its
growth
is
assured.
it
is
only
10%
completed.
this
is
a
rich
--
potentially
rich
industrial
area.”
the
commission
made
its
decision
based
upon
all
the
evidence
submitted
to
it
including
rock
island
only
non-carrier
witness,
professor
fair.
with
respect
to
the
--
even
the
district
court
found
that
the
commission's
finding
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
traffic
would
increase
in
volume
and
revenues
would
increase
in
the
future,
have
substantial
support
in
the
evidence.
with

mr.
william

no,
mr.

white.
there's
not

no
evidence
in

that
effect.
mr.

there
was

mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
there
was
an
allegation
made
mr.
justice
white
because
the
rock
island
and
the
petition
for
reconsideration
before
the
commission,
proper
this
evidence
as
available
to
the
commission
for
review
as
to
what
the
--
what
have
transpired
since
the
case
had
been
closed.
and
the
commission
weighed
this
evidence
--
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
believe
its
1959,
we
--
it
is
my
turn
to
take
at
that
time.
there
were
subsequent
petitions
were
--
a
subsequent
supplemental
applications
filed
to
correct
the
deficiency
and
also
for
approval
of
a
--
an
operating
agreement
and
that
was
finally
approved
by
the
commission
in
1962.
with
reference
to
this
the
--
a
district
court
in
the
rock
island
alleged
that
there
was
not
support
--
not
substantial
support
in
the
record
for
the
findings
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
operation
was
profitable.
the
commission
did
so
find
that
the
operations
on
land
whole
revenue
--
involving
land
whole
revenues
would
be
profitable
and
the
rock
island
does
not
argue
with
this.
since
the
district
court
found
there
was
ample
--
substantial
support
in
the
record
for
the
finding
that
the
proposed
operation
would
be
less
expensive
because
there
would
be

they
had

the
switching
charges.
rock
island
bases
its
whole
attack
upon
the
cross
towns
switching
about
which
the
commission
had
expressed
some
concern.
the
commissioner
however
as
the
body
charge
with
the
administration
in
the
act
regarding
rate
said
that
this
was
a
matter
which
could
be
successfully
resolved
in
the
future.
rock
island
in
attempting
to
rate
up
the
word
future
from
the
statute
contended
in
this
brief
and
before
the
commission,
that
as
long
as
the
commission
failed
to
make
a
finding
that
its
service
was
unsatisfactory
that
it
had
no
right,
no
power
to
grant
authority
to
other
carriers
to
perform
to
--
to
supply
competitive
service.
what
rock
island
fails
to
add
however
is
that
each
one
of
its
customers
are
--
the
lake
calumet
harbor
supported
these
applications.
inspite
of
its
allegation
that
the
service
was
satisfactory.
shippers'
representatives
of
port,
public
officials
all
stressed
that
value
of
competitive
rail
service
and
the
effect
it
would
have
upon
the
development
of
the
port.
the
president
of
the
largest
terminal
company
in
the
world,
the
appellant,
north
pier
terminal
company
testified
and
he
cited
his
own
company's
experience
for
having
removed
its
facilities
from
milwaukee
because
it
lack
competitive
service.
it
had
the
service
of
a
single
truck
line
carrier.
he
cited
this
in
his
experience
and
having
the
lead
a
place
in
chicago.
he
located
out
the
lake
calumet
harbor
with
the
expectation.
there
they
would
receive
competitive
rail
service
while
the
commission
found
that
the
service
of
the
commission
--
of
the
rock
island
was
fairly
satisfactory.
its
own
superintendent
justified
as
to
the
fact
that
they
have
received
complaints
in
1955,
1956
and
1957.
the
other
warehouse
operators
lake
calumet
testified
that
they
agreed
with
the
present
north
pier
terminal
when
he
testified
that
actually
there
service
left
something
to
be
desired.
that
they
had
complained
continually
but
at
the
service
had
improved
and
he
was
asked
when
the
service
improved.
and
he
said
when
this
case
would
docket?
when
this
case
docketed?
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
opinion
in
order
that
district
court
and
remand
to
that
court
with
the
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
yes,
i
do
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words,
the
whole
evidence
should
be
taken
in
consideration
and
our
whole
evidence
here
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
basic
findings,
the
findings
of
the
commission
are
have
been
found
they
have
support
in
the
record
and
there
are
--
the
chesapeake
on
ohio
case,
the
schaffer
transportation
case,
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
which
state
that
the
district
court
has
no
right
to
substitute
its
opinion
as
long
as
he
find
--
they
made
differ
from
the
conclusion
rates.
but
as
long
as
there
support
in
the
record
for
findings
of
the
commission,
they
cannot
change
that
conclusion.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
was
thinking
of
the
defense
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
have
--
the
general
principle
of
the
universal
camera
case
as
i
understand
it
is
that
all
the
evidence,
the
total
evidence
should
be
considered.
i
really
feel
that
there
are
other
cases
closer
to
point
in
that.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that's
inconsistent.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
no,
i
never
say
--
i
don't
--
i
believe
there
are
other
cases
mr.
justice
black
that
--
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
no,
mr.
posner,
counsel
of
the
department
of
justice
will.
i
may
add
this
one
particular
point.
i'm
going
over
the
last
night
again
i
read
the
dissenting
opinion
as
well
as
the
majority
opinion.
and
there
is
one
statement
in
there
where
judge
edwards
was
of
the
impression
that
this
new
contract
that
the
agreement
between
--
the
lease
agreement
between
the
ports
and
the
railroads
have
not
been
the
subject
of
interrogation
at
the
original
hearing.
but
actually
if
--
it
was
the
subject
of
interrogation
and
as
matter
of
fact
you
can
find
that
on
pages
798,
802
of
the
record.
and
i
believe
that
is
the
only
place
were
it
lead
--
mr.
william
j.
o'brien,
jr.
yes,
he
is
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you
very
much.
