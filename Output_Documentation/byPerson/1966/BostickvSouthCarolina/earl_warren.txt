mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
brandon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
language
of
the
clerk
that
you
rely
on
to
that
effect,
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
--
does
that
say
that
there
are
one
or
two
on
every
one?
he
said,
he
doesn't
remember
anyone
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
it's
more
than
one
or
two.
now
specifically,
before
that,
he
said
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
--
there
were
none
that
he
could
recognize
on
‘58,
‘59,
‘60
or
‘61?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
might
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
i
also
--
there's
one
for
‘61
and
he
said,
if
there's
a
negro
on
there.
i
don't
recognize
it.
i
have
looked
at
them
hardly.
i
know
every
man
on
here
personally
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
so
forth
that
whether
in
relation
with
the
other.
we'll
recess
now
and
you
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
answer
that
after.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
was,
i
believe,
i
asked
it
two
i
think.
but
i
think
my
question
at
that
time
was
that,
where
do
you
find
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
sensenbach
the
précised
language
to
the
effect
that
there
was
one
or
two
on
every
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
answer
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
but
the
counsel
pointed
out
on
pages
66,
67,
and
68
certain
answer
of
citizen
which
says
this
witness
said,
first
concerning
was
february
1961
grand
jury,
if
there
is
a
negro
on
there
i
don't
recognize
it.
i've
looked
at
them
hardly.
i
know
every
man
on
here
personally
and
he
said
that
he
didn't.
then,
again
on
67,
i'll
show
you
the
grand
jury
list
and
the
petty
list
for
the
term
1960
of
the
general
session's
court.
may
i
ask
you
to
take
your
time,
sir,
and
see
whether
or
not
you
could
identify
any
of
these
are
negroes?
i
don't
recall
the
1960
this
particular
jury
but
we
have
one
man
there
by
the
name
of
seblest.
we
have
both
white
and
colored
by
the
same
name.
now,
whether
this
would
be
one
of
them,
i
could
not
tell.
so
they
have
no
recollection
of
that.
then,
please
indulge
me
sir
and
let
the
grand
jury
list
of
february
‘59
and
petty
jury
list.
there
is
one
colored
here
that
i
have
run
onto
already
come
tony
brown.
we
have
another
one
here
who
might
be
colored
but
i
think
it
is
a
white
one
and
so
on.
now,
the
fact
to
the
answers,
there
never
was
more
than
or
two
when
the
question
was
asked
it
shouldn't
follow,
should
it,
that
there
was
one
or
two
in
every
panel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
kind
the
numbers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
brandon,
one
thing
that
occurs
to
me
is
this.
if
it
is
a
fair
system,
if
they
are
giving
the
negroes
a
chance
to
serve
on
the
jury
when
that
charge
of
this
kind
is
made
that
is
the
charge
of
invidious
discrimination,
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
state
to
have
someone
there
who
could
say,
that
is
not
a
fact
because
we
know
every
negro
that's
on
this
jury
because
we
picked
them
from
the
voting
register
and
the
voting
register
designates
them
negroes
or
white.
and
then
show
in
the
preceding
how
many
have
served.
how
many
have
been
called
but
nothing
with
that
kind
is
brought
into
the
record
by
the
state.
all
that
comes
out
is
what
these
folks
on
the
other
side
are
able
to
drag
out
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
the
commissioners.
now,
why
couldn't
the
state
say
very
frankly,
we
have
so
many
on
this
jury,
we
have
so
many
on
the
other
and
as
a
result,
there
is
more
invidious
discrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
a
man's
--
what
a
man's
life
is
in
jeopardy,
they
shouldn't
be
sloppily
tried
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
that
be
would
you
say,
i
didn't
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
perry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
1960?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1959?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
cite
the
case
of
whitus
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
your
final
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

what

chief

yes.
but
i
also
--
there's
one
for

he
said,

there's

i
don't
recognize
