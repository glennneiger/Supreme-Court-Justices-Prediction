justice
abe
fortas
it
may
--
may
not
correctly
coalesce.
are
you
telling
us
that
only
one
negro
is
selected
for
the
grand
jury
at
any
time
in
the
--
his
list
so
far
as
this
record
shows?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
--
i
remember
that
but
he
was
asking
about
the
february
term
of
court
of
the
grand
juries
over
a
period
of
time.
but
then
as
i
understand
it
there
are
six
--
that
there
are
six
terms
of
the
court
each
year?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
--
that
--
oh,
you
have
only
one
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
my
--
my
notes
which
may
be
incorrect
to
the
fact
that
his
testimony
that
then
the
1959
term,
there
was
one
negro
in
the
grand
jury
panel,
1960
term
possibly
one
negro,
and
1962
term
which
was
when
petitioner
was
tried
the
one
negro
in
the
grand
jury
trial,
and
similarly
in
1963
one
negro
in
the
grand
jury
panel.
and
here,
you're
telling
me
now
that
the
record
shows
the
contrary?
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
read
that
testimony
that
way
but
i
may
be
wrong.
but
i
--
i
understand
your
position,
but
i
want
the
entire
point.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
perry,
i'd
appreciate
it
if
you
would
to
tell
me
again.
this
court
you
believe
shows
a
systematic
discrimination
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
list
of
voters,
the
elector's
list
does
separate
the
negro
and
white,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
me
just
what
the
record
shows
as
this
as
to
how
that
list
of
electors
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
making
up
the
contents
of
the
jury
box?
justice
abe
fortas
this
what
bothers
me
in
this
case
because
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony,
are
you
saying
that
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony
makes
out
the
case
of
systematic
discrimination
take
that
alone
now?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
wanted
to
get
clear.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
fact
that
--
you're
saying
there
was
only
one
negro
who
called
for
grand
jury
service.
now,
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
then
you're
saying
from
that
fact
regardless
of
the
rest
of
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony,
we
should
infer
systematic
grand
jury
exclusion?
justice
abe
fortas
despite
the
fact
that
in
this
record,
he
has
testified
by
at
least
the
record
can
be
read.
i
don't
know
whether
i
would
read
it
this
way.
but
it
can
be
read
as
showing
his
testimony
to
contradict
the
--
any
systematic
exclusion.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
is
--
i
miss
that
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
designate
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
perry,
are
you
suggesting
that
mr.
martin's
testimony
is
in
parallel
to
a
lot
of
weight.
i
notice
that
he
asked
if
there
had
been
attendance
for
claiming
degree
of
regularity
in
the
court
sessions.
instead,
they
usually
draw
about
once
or
thrice
a
year
and
i
shouldn't
--
it
might
be
a
little
doubt
as
to
whether
his
testimony
is
absolutely
complete,
he's
been
in
court
once
or
twice
a
year.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that
anything
said
rather
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
the
grand
juries
operating
in
public
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
it
may
--
may
not
correctly
coalesce.
