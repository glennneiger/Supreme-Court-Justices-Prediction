mr.
everett
n.
brandon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
of
course
that
the
fair
reading
of
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony
will
show
that
he
testified
that
there
was
at
least
one
negro
on
the
grand
jury
for
the
period
prior
to
the
time
in
which
bostick
was
tried.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
we
think
that
he
said
that
there
was
usually
one
on
the
grand
jury
and
that
while
the
record
is
not
entirely
explicit
as
to
each
year,
we
think
that
there
is
the
fair
inference
to
be
withdrawn
from
that
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
since
1958
and
of
course
the
petitioner
has
said
that
it
refers
to
the
time
prior
but
there
was
no
direct
examination
of
any
witness
as
to
any
time
prior
to
1958
except
that
mr.
sensenbach
was
asked
about
the
quashing
of
an
indictment
in
1954
and
he
said
that,
it
was
quashed
and
that
after
they
did
about
the
same
thing.
now,
that
is
not
to
be
read
as
if
they
discriminated
by
not
putting
negroes
on
the
jury.
that
is
cleared
up
in
my
judgment
by
the
later
testimony
of
ms.
farley.
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
and
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
three
jury
commissioners.
they
are
all
elected
officials
and
rather
than
confining
ourselves
to
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony,
we
must
read
it
all
and
miss
farley
said
and
she
was
quite
clear
about
this
that
the
crossing
of
the
indictment
did
not
refer
to
the
exclusion
of
negroes
but
referred
to
the
manner
in
which
a
holdover
grand
juror
had
been
selected
for
that
year.
now,
in
south
carolina,
we
have
a
grand
jury
of
18
and
six
of
those
are
held
over
selected
by
lot
each
year
at
the
time
the
whole
master
jury
box
is
prepared
and
while
the
record
is
not
clear
what
she
meant
by
that,
it
is
clear
that
she
in
her
own
mind
knew
that
it
did
not
refer
to
discriminatory
selection,
exclusion
or
inclusion
of
negroes.
now
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
alright
sir.
our
electors
are
in
big
books
alphabetically.
there
is
no
separation
of
negroes
or
whites.
they
go
on
there
the
way
they're
registered.
if
a
white
comes
first,
he's
put
on
there.
if
a
negro
is
first,
he
comes
on
there.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no
question
by
that.
this
designated
by
race.
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
the
registration
books
which
are
used
to
select
jurors
are
--
designated
race.
now,
we
submit
to
that
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
the
statute
requires
that
two
out
of
three
males
be
selected
and
this
year,
i
think
we're
going
to
get
women
on
there
but
with
reference
to
this
case,
it
requires
two
not
less
than
two
out
of
three
males.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
for
the
simple
reason
sir,
that
if
the
statute
is
complied
with
and
two-thirds
of
those
eligible
are
placed
in
the
jury
box,
those
names
are
typed
on
a
small
piece
of
paper
rolled
up,
inserted
in
a
little
pellet
or
a
capsule
thing,
fastened,
placed
in
a
box,
and
mixed
up.
there's
absolutely
no
opportunity
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
there
is
in
that
and
of
course
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so
because
as
i
read
whitus,
they
used
what
the
court
had
condemned,
a
list
condemned,
and
then
also
another
list
that
had
been
supplied.
the
facts
i
guess
that
separated
them
by
color
and
all.
but,
as
i
read
swain
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
as
i
understand
whitus,
they
were
separate
in
list,
that
negroes
in
one
section
of
whites
in
another.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
our
system
that
to
have
the
race
designated
on
there,
it
would
be
helpful
because
you
have
an
opportunity
to
at
least
get
of
somewhat
of
a
proportion
of
representation
into
the
jury
box.
otherwise,
if
it
were
not
designated,
you
wouldn't
know
whether
you
had
any
negroes
in
there
or
not.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
there
is
a
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
in
about
--
there
were
--
the
testimony
of
the
registration
board,
the
clerk
in
the
board
was
if
there
were
900
plus
i
think
whites
and
200
plus
negroes.
it's
about
four
to
one,
i
think.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
on
panels?
no,
sir.
and
of
course,
there
--
on
the
grand
jurors
we
got
12
and
as
i
interpret
in
this
record
there
was
usually
one
negro
and
possibly
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
on
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony
on
page
71,
i
think
that
--
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
read
that
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
he
answered,
“i
don't
think
on
a
grand
jury
there
has
been
more
than
one
or
two
at
any
one
term
that
i
can
recall.”
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
i
will
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
67
and
he
refers
to
the
list
of
february
1959
and
he
says,
there's
one
colored
here,
i
have
ran
onto
already
tony
brown.
and
we
have
another
one
here
who
might
be
called.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
time
we
had
adjourned,
you
had
just
asked
a
question.
i
wonder
if
i
might
ask
you
to
repeat
that
or
do
you
recall
just
what
you
said?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
do
not
believe
that
that
précised
language
is
in
the
record
any
more
than
the
précised
language
that
there
was
only
one
negro
on
the
grand
jury
at
any
time
in
the
county.
now
on
68,
i
referred
to
that
where
he
said,
“i
don't
think
there's
been
more
than
one
or
two
at
any
one
term
that
i
can
recall.”
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
and
then
on
71,
so
that
at
most
you
have
only
been
able
to
observe
one
negro
serving
on
the
grand
jury
at
one
time,
is
that
correct?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
in
my
recollection.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
not
necessarily,
except
with
and
the
general
context
of
his
testimony,
he
said
that
there
were
--
that
negro
served
on
the
grand
juries
and
negro
served
on
the
petty
juries
and
in
varying
numbers.
it
does
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
in
varying
numbers.
i
think
you
said
in
two
--
i
think
you
had
one
term
there
was
six
on
the
petty
jury.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
petty
jury.
now,
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
of
course,
the
percentage
of
white
and
colored
is
fairly
equal
or
maybe
a
little
more
colored.
but
prior
to
the
last
few
years,
the
colored
were
not
registered
in
the
numbers
that
the
whites
were.
for
instance,
back
10,
15
years
ago,
while
they
were
allowed
to
register
and
if
--
there's
testimony
in
the
record
that
they
were
kept
from
it.
they
just
didn't
do
it,
so
they
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
i
think
it
does
show
that
it
has
been
done
in
some
places
but
i
don't
know
that
history
shows
it
was
done
in
jasper
county,
south
carolina.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
can't
answer
that
question.
as
you
know
and
as
the
court
knows,
that's
just
been
customary
to
do
that.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
--
and
not
only
in
that
but
in
other
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
do
not
believe
that
has
been
used
in
jasper
county,
south
carolina.
no
sir,
not
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
apparently
was
used
that
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
it
apparently
was,
yes,
sir.
i
will
have
to
agree
with
you.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
on
the
registration
records?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
of
course
as
i
reach
whitus
and
i
said
this
before
it's
been
up
here
a
couple
of
times
and
if
--
as
i
read
it
when
they
prepared
the
last
jury
list,
they
used
the
list
that
has
bee
prepared
from
a
so-called
tainted
source,
plus
the
designation
from
the
tax
list.
now
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
want
to
see
or
colored?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
they're
also
separated
into
colored,
different
colored
type
in,
if
this
part
of
the
books
and
want
it.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
from
which
the
box
was
filled.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
--
i
will
certainly
concede
that
that
designation
puts
the
situation
into
such
a
--
into
such
a
condition
that
it
could
be
abused.
that
is
--
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
read
that.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
well,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
record
that
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
sensenbach
that
they
made
an
effort
to
put
a
proportion
of
the
negroes
and
proportion
of
the
number
of
whites
in
the
jury
box
itself
in
the
little
pellets
from
which
it
has
not
been
questioned
that
there
can
be
discrimination
thereafter.
now,
the
other
member
of
the
jury
commission,
who
testified
--
who
testified
that
they
did
not
do
it
in
proportion
that
--
but
that
they
went
down
the
list
and
made
a
bona
fide
effort
to
get
two
out
of
three
without
regard
to
the
race,
but
that
in
her
judgment
there
were
substantial
negroes
placed
in
the
jury
box.
now,
i
believe
that
the
record
would
support
or
at
least
that
would
be
a
rebuttal
to
a
prima
facie
indication
of
discrimination,
if
such
is
found
in
this
case.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
if
your
honor
please,
this
record
doesn't
cover
every
term
of
court
for
every
year
since
1958.
it
usually
just
refers
to
one
term
and
does
not
go
down
through
the
whole
six
terms
of
civil
and
criminal
court
that
might
be
held
in
the
county
in
its
various
parts.
it's
not
--
not
complete
at
all
in
that
regard.
now,
there
is
testimony
that
has
many
as
six,
mr.
sensenbach
said,
had
been
drawn
on
the
petty
jury.
now,
the
maximum
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
none
sir,
on
this
case
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
can
assure
the
court
that
negroes
served
on
juries
in
jasper
county.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
this
record?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
that
no
effort
has
been
made
to
determine
that
that
i
know
of
to
that
number.
actually
served
on
the
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
only
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
never
found
jury
discrimination
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
to
my
knowledge
and
that
goes
back
to
franklin
against
south
carolina
in
1910.
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
jury
discrimination
in
this
particular
case.
i
will
not
stand
here
and
argue
that.
now,
in
the
beginning,
my
argument,
i
believe
i
said
that
we
draw,
only
draw
12
new
grand
jurors
each
year.
and
assuming
that
one
of
those
is
a
negro,
that
is
one-twelfth
from
the
eight
of
10%
and
at
varying
times
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
it
may
not
be
enough
but
it
seems
to
me,
it
certainly
doesn't
qualify
proportionately
which
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
not
required.
it
does
not
necessarily
or
even
desire
them.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes
sir.
now,
in
order
to
do
that
i
would
submit
that
our
procedure
whereby
we
designate
them
on
the
registration
rolls
would
work
to
that
end.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
if
you
just
ask
me
sir
why?
how
can
we
see
that
we
get
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
of
course,
i'm
not
responsible
for
the
system
but
i
am
defending
it
and
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
in
south
carolina.
i
think
that
this
case
is
just
sort
of
an
offshoot
that
has
been
picked
up
where
there
is
an
indication
or
sort
of
a
braggadocio
attitude
on
the
part
of
one
clerk
of
court.
i
know
the
gentleman.
and
i
think
he
just
got
in
this
year
and
he
was
going
to
say
that
i
know
90%
of
the
negroes
in
jasper
county
and
i
in
my
mind
know
that
that
is
not
true.
he
doesn't
know
90%.
i'm
not
reading
here
any
--
any
facts.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
it's
not
true
--
i
would
think
that
probably
this
court
doesn't
know
90%
of
employees
that
work
here
and
that
i
don't
know
90%
of
the
people
that
work
in
the
highway
department.
we've
only
got
500
in
the
headquarters
in
columbia.
it's
just
an
act
of
prior
again
on
this
part
and
i've
been
stuck
with
it
for
several
years.
i
do
submit
that
the
prior
testimony
in
the
record
on
behalf
of
ms.
farley
clears
up
several
things
that
mr.
sensenbach
said
that
they
don't
necessarily
jive.
now,
we
could
have
had
better
proof
of
what
happened
in
1954
but
nobody
knew
that
was
going
to
be
an
issue
until
the
petitioner
asked
him
about
the
pausing
of
the
indictment
in
the
1954
and
he
comes
right
back
and
says,
we
did
exactly
the
same
after
that.
if
he
had
been
discriminating
then
purposely,
invidiously,
would
he
have
said
that?
or
if
--
if
he
was
purposely
and
invidiously
discriminated,
would
he
say
that
i
know
90%
of
the
negroes
in
jasper
county
and
thereby
lay
himself
open
to
the
charge
that
went
--
that
he
can
manipulate
him
as
he
saw
fit.
now,
of
course,
we
do
have
the
other
jury
commissioners
and
i
just
don't
think
that
it's
possible
under
the
system
that
we
have
public
drawing
for
the
petty
jury
list
that
it
can
--
you
can
lay
aside
one
and
hold
out
until
you
can
pick
one
that
is
right
that
you
need.
they
are
in
capsules
and
you
can't
tell
until
you
unfold.
and
as
i
said
in
answer
to
your
question
a
few
moments
ago
that,
i
don't
believe
in
percentages
but
if
one
out
of
12
has
been
with
any
degree
of
consistency,
several
years
out
of
the
--
out
of
eight
to
10,
that
is
eight
or
10
or
12%
of
whatever
it
is
and
back
then
they
might
not
have
been
that
many
registered
negro
male
electors
in
the
box.
and
of
course,
it's
increasing
along
as
to
the
numbers
and
the
question
would
--
as
it
should
be.
and
of
course
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
the
only
answer
i
can
make
to
that
is
your
honor
is
that
lawsuits
are
tried
sometimes
a
long
way
from
the
way
place
where
the
principal
case
was
tried
and
in
this
instance
it
was
in
columbia.
and
lawsuits
are
sometimes
sloppily
tried,
that
happens.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
they
--
i
certainly
agree.
referring
to
one
or
two
other
cases,
of
course,
the
court
at
all
is
entirely
familiar
with
those
cases
where
one
negro
was
picked
on
the
grand
jury
in
18
years
and
one
in
24
or
one
out
of
600
and
that
sort
of
thing.
we
don't
think
that
that
situation
exists
here.
we
would
refer
to
the
case
of
swain
against
alabama,
where
the
--
i
think
the
overall
percentages
and
variances
and
what
not
are
not
a
great
deal
different
from
that
in
the
principal
case
and
this
court
upheld
that.
and
there
is
a
statement
in
swain
that
apparently
a
little
effort
in
alabama
was
made
to
ensure
that
all
groups
were
represented
upon
the
jury
list.
and
i
would
submit
that
under
our
practice
of
taking
them
from
a
registration
list
was
to
show
white
and
colored.
and
if
that
is
fairly
followed
that
that
would
be
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
there
are
representative
numbers
of
negroes
in
the
jury
box
and
then
you
mix
them
up
amd
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
say
that
if
that
is
followed
fairly.
take
two-thirds
as
our
statute
requires
of
all
eligible
male
electors
from
the
registration
votes.
even
if
you
take
two-thirds
colored
and
two-thirds
white
which
i
don't
think
would
be
entirely
proper
but
if
that
were
done,
what
complaint
could
be
made
if
they
are
all
put
in
the
box
and
mixed
up
and
thereafter
there's
no
opportunity
for
discrimination
as
i
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
by
the
actual
registration
itself.
yes
sir.
they're
of
course,
it
would
depend
on
that.
i
believe
there's
no
question
of
that
race
in
this
case
and
i
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
it
could
come
into
it
but
i
certainly
--
in
south
carolina
this
doesn't
exist.
now,
your
honor
as
far
as
prohibiting
anybody
from
registering
and
i'm
certain
that
counsel
here
will
assure
the
court
that
that
is
true.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
cheat,
you
want
to
be
crook,
there's
opportunity
and
there's
lots,
lots
of
places.
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
this
record
should
be
used
to
hang
the
first
jury
discrimination
case
around
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
one
up
until
now.
thank
you.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
would
certainly
think
if
not
more
than
2,500
possibly
without
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
of
course
that
the
fair
reading
of
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony
will
show
that
he
testified
that
there
was
at
least
one
negro
on
the
grand
jury
for
the
period
prior
to
the
time
in
which
bostick
was
tried.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
we
think
that
he
said
that
there
was
usually
one
on
the
grand
jury
and
that
while
the
record
is
not
entirely
explicit
as
to
each
year,
we
think
that
there
is
the
fair
inference
to
be
withdrawn
from
that
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
since
1958
and
of
course
the
petitioner
has
said
that
it
refers
to
the
time
prior
but
there
was
no
direct
examination
of
any
witness
as
to
any
time
prior
to
1958
except
that
mr.
sensenbach
was
asked
about
the
quashing
of
an
indictment
in
1954
and
he
said
that,
it
was
quashed
and
that
after
they
did
about
the
same
thing.
now,
that
is
not
to
be
read
as
if
they
discriminated
by
not
putting
negroes
on
the
jury.
that
is
cleared
up
in
my
judgment
by
the
later
testimony
of
ms.
farley.
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
and
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
three
jury
commissioners.
they
are
all
elected
officials
and
rather
than
confining
ourselves
to
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony,
we
must
read
it
all
and
miss
farley
said
and
she
was
quite
clear
about
this
that
the
crossing
of
the
indictment
did
not
refer
to
the
exclusion
of
negroes
but
referred
to
the
manner
in
which
a
holdover
grand
juror
had
been
selected
for
that
year.
now,
in
south
carolina,
we
have
a
grand
jury
of
18
and
six
of
those
are
held
over
selected
by
lot
each
year
at
the
time
the
whole
master
jury
box
is
prepared
and
while
the
record
is
not
clear
what
she
meant
by
that,
it
is
clear
that
she
in
her
own
mind
knew
that
it
did
not
refer
to
discriminatory
selection,
exclusion
or
inclusion
of
negroes.
now
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
alright
sir.
our
electors
are
in
big
books
alphabetically.
there
is
no
separation
of
negroes
or
whites.
they
go
on
there
the
way
they're
registered.
if
a
white
comes
first,
he's
put
on
there.
if
a
negro
is
first,
he
comes
on
there.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no
question
by
that.
this
designated
by
race.
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
the
registration
books
which
are
used
to
select
jurors
are
--
designated
race.
now,
we
submit
to
that
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
the
statute
requires
that
two
out
of
three
males
be
selected
and
this
year,
i
think
we're
going
to
get
women
on
there
but
with
reference
to
this
case,
it
requires
two
not
less
than
two
out
of
three
males.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
for
the
simple
reason
sir,
that
if
the
statute
is
complied
with
and
two-thirds
of
those
eligible
are
placed
in
the
jury
box,
those
names
are
typed
on
a
small
piece
of
paper
rolled
up,
inserted
in
a
little
pellet
or
a
capsule
thing,
fastened,
placed
in
a
box,
and
mixed
up.
there's
absolutely
no
opportunity
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
there
is
in
that
and
of
course
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so
because
as
i
read
whitus,
they
used
what
the
court
had
condemned,
a
list
condemned,
and
then
also
another
list
that
had
been
supplied.
the
facts
i
guess
that
separated
them
by
color
and
all.
but,
as
i
read
swain
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
as
i
understand
whitus,
they
were
separate
in
list,
that
negroes
in
one
section
of
whites
in
another.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
our
system
that
to
have
the
race
designated
on
there,
it
would
be
helpful
because
you
have
an
opportunity
to
at
least
get
of
somewhat
of
a
proportion
of
representation
into
the
jury
box.
otherwise,
if
it
were
not
designated,
you
wouldn't
know
whether
you
had
any
negroes
in
there
or
not.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
there
is
a
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
in
about
--
there
were
--
the
testimony
of
the
registration
board,
the
clerk
in
the
board
was
if
there
were
900
plus
i
think
whites
and
200
plus
negroes.
it's
about
four
to
one,
i
think.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
on
panels?
no,
sir.
and
of
course,
there
--
on
the
grand
jurors
we
got
12
and
as
i
interpret
in
this
record
there
was
usually
one
negro
and
possibly
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
on
mr.
sensenbach's
testimony
on
page
71,
i
think
that
--
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
read
that
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
he
answered,
“i
don't
think
on
a
grand
jury
there
has
been
more
than
one
or
two
at
any
one
term
that
i
can
recall.”
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
i
will
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
67
and
he
refers
to
the
list
of
february
1959
and
he
says,
there's
one
colored
here,
i
have
ran
onto
already
tony
brown.
and
we
have
another
one
here
who
might
be
called.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
time
we
had
adjourned,
you
had
just
asked
a
question.
i
wonder
if
i
might
ask
you
to
repeat
that
or
do
you
recall
just
what
you
said?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
do
not
believe
that
that
précised
language
is
in
the
record
any
more
than
the
précised
language
that
there
was
only
one
negro
on
the
grand
jury
at
any
time
in
the
county.
now
on
68,
i
referred
to
that
where
he
said,
“i
don't
think
there's
been
more
than
one
or
two
at
any
one
term
that
i
can
recall.”
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
and
then
on
71,
so
that
at
most
you
have
only
been
able
to
observe
one
negro
serving
on
the
grand
jury
at
one
time,
is
that
correct?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
in
my
recollection.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
not
necessarily,
except
with
and
the
general
context
of
his
testimony,
he
said
that
there
were
--
that
negro
served
on
the
grand
juries
and
negro
served
on
the
petty
juries
and
in
varying
numbers.
it
does
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
in
varying
numbers.
i
think
you
said
in
two
--
i
think
you
had
one
term
there
was
six
on
the
petty
jury.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
petty
jury.
now,
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
of
course,
the
percentage
of
white
and
colored
is
fairly
equal
or
maybe
a
little
more
colored.
but
prior
to
the
last
few
years,
the
colored
were
not
registered
in
the
numbers
that
the
whites
were.
for
instance,
back
10,
15
years
ago,
while
they
were
allowed
to
register
and
if
--
there's
testimony
in
the
record
that
they
were
kept
from
it.
they
just
didn't
do
it,
so
they
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
i
think
it
does
show
that
it
has
been
done
in
some
places
but
i
don't
know
that
history
shows
it
was
done
in
jasper
county,
south
carolina.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
can't
answer
that
question.
as
you
know
and
as
the
court
knows,
that's
just
been
customary
to
do
that.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
--
and
not
only
in
that
but
in
other
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
do
not
believe
that
has
been
used
in
jasper
county,
south
carolina.
no
sir,
not
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
apparently
was
used
that
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
it
apparently
was,
yes,
sir.
i
will
have
to
agree
with
you.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
on
the
registration
records?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
of
course
as
i
reach
whitus
and
i
said
this
before
it's
been
up
here
a
couple
of
times
and
if
--
as
i
read
it
when
they
prepared
the
last
jury
list,
they
used
the
list
that
has
bee
prepared
from
a
so-called
tainted
source,
plus
the
designation
from
the
tax
list.
now
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
want
to
see
or
colored?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
they're
also
separated
into
colored,
different
colored
type
in,
if
this
part
of
the
books
and
want
it.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
from
which
the
box
was
filled.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
--
i
will
certainly
concede
that
that
designation
puts
the
situation
into
such
a
--
into
such
a
condition
that
it
could
be
abused.
that
is
--
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
read
that.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
well,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
record
that
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
sensenbach
that
they
made
an
effort
to
put
a
proportion
of
the
negroes
and
proportion
of
the
number
of
whites
in
the
jury
box
itself
in
the
little
pellets
from
which
it
has
not
been
questioned
that
there
can
be
discrimination
thereafter.
now,
the
other
member
of
the
jury
commission,
who
testified
--
who
testified
that
they
did
not
do
it
in
proportion
that
--
but
that
they
went
down
the
list
and
made
a
bona
fide
effort
to
get
two
out
of
three
without
regard
to
the
race,
but
that
in
her
judgment
there
were
substantial
negroes
placed
in
the
jury
box.
now,
i
believe
that
the
record
would
support
or
at
least
that
would
be
a
rebuttal
to
a
prima
facie
indication
of
discrimination,
if
such
is
found
in
this
case.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
if
your
honor
please,
this
record
doesn't
cover
every
term
of
court
for
every
year
since
1958.
it
usually
just
refers
to
one
term
and
does
not
go
down
through
the
whole
six
terms
of
civil
and
criminal
court
that
might
be
held
in
the
county
in
its
various
parts.
it's
not
--
not
complete
at
all
in
that
regard.
now,
there
is
testimony
that
has
many
as
six,
mr.
sensenbach
said,
had
been
drawn
on
the
petty
jury.
now,
the
maximum
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
none
sir,
on
this
case
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
can
assure
the
court
that
negroes
served
on
juries
in
jasper
county.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
this
record?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
that
no
effort
has
been
made
to
determine
that
that
i
know
of
to
that
number.
actually
served
on
the
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
only
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
never
found
jury
discrimination
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
to
my
knowledge
and
that
goes
back
to
franklin
against
south
carolina
in
1910.
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
jury
discrimination
in
this
particular
case.
i
will
not
stand
here
and
argue
that.
now,
in
the
beginning,
my
argument,
i
believe
i
said
that
we
draw,
only
draw
12
new
grand
jurors
each
year.
and
assuming
that
one
of
those
is
a
negro,
that
is
one-twelfth
from
the
eight
of
10%
and
at
varying
times
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
it
may
not
be
enough
but
it
seems
to
me,
it
certainly
doesn't
qualify
proportionately
which
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
not
required.
it
does
not
necessarily
or
even
desire
them.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes
sir.
now,
in
order
to
do
that
i
would
submit
that
our
procedure
whereby
we
designate
them
on
the
registration
rolls
would
work
to
that
end.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
sir?
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
if
you
just
ask
me
sir
why?
how
can
we
see
that
we
get
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
no,
sir.
of
course,
i'm
not
responsible
for
the
system
but
i
am
defending
it
and
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
in
south
carolina.
i
think
that
this
case
is
just
sort
of
an
offshoot
that
has
been
picked
up
where
there
is
an
indication
or
sort
of
a
braggadocio
attitude
on
the
part
of
one
clerk
of
court.
i
know
the
gentleman.
and
i
think
he
just
got
in
this
year
and
he
was
going
to
say
that
i
know
90%
of
the
negroes
in
jasper
county
and
i
in
my
mind
know
that
that
is
not
true.
he
doesn't
know
90%.
i'm
not
reading
here
any
--
any
facts.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
it's
not
true
--
i
would
think
that
probably
this
court
doesn't
know
90%
of
employees
that
work
here
and
that
i
don't
know
90%
of
the
people
that
work
in
the
highway
department.
we've
only
got
500
in
the
headquarters
in
columbia.
it's
just
an
act
of
prior
again
on
this
part
and
i've
been
stuck
with
it
for
several
years.
i
do
submit
that
the
prior
testimony
in
the
record
on
behalf
of
ms.
farley
clears
up
several
things
that
mr.
sensenbach
said
that
they
don't
necessarily
jive.
now,
we
could
have
had
better
proof
of
what
happened
in
1954
but
nobody
knew
that
was
going
to
be
an
issue
until
the
petitioner
asked
him
about
the
pausing
of
the
indictment
in
the
1954
and
he
comes
right
back
and
says,
we
did
exactly
the
same
after
that.
if
he
had
been
discriminating
then
purposely,
invidiously,
would
he
have
said
that?
or
if
--
if
he
was
purposely
and
invidiously
discriminated,
would
he
say
that
i
know
90%
of
the
negroes
in
jasper
county
and
thereby
lay
himself
open
to
the
charge
that
went
--
that
he
can
manipulate
him
as
he
saw
fit.
now,
of
course,
we
do
have
the
other
jury
commissioners
and
i
just
don't
think
that
it's
possible
under
the
system
that
we
have
public
drawing
for
the
petty
jury
list
that
it
can
--
you
can
lay
aside
one
and
hold
out
until
you
can
pick
one
that
is
right
that
you
need.
they
are
in
capsules
and
you
can't
tell
until
you
unfold.
and
as
i
said
in
answer
to
your
question
a
few
moments
ago
that,
i
don't
believe
in
percentages
but
if
one
out
of
12
has
been
with
any
degree
of
consistency,
several
years
out
of
the
--
out
of
eight
to
10,
that
is
eight
or
10
or
12%
of
whatever
it
is
and
back
then
they
might
not
have
been
that
many
registered
negro
male
electors
in
the
box.
and
of
course,
it's
increasing
along
as
to
the
numbers
and
the
question
would
--
as
it
should
be.
and
of
course
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
the
only
answer
i
can
make
to
that
is
your
honor
is
that
lawsuits
are
tried
sometimes
a
long
way
from
the
way
place
where
the
principal
case
was
tried
and
in
this
instance
it
was
in
columbia.
and
lawsuits
are
sometimes
sloppily
tried,
that
happens.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
well,
they
--
i
certainly
agree.
referring
to
one
or
two
other
cases,
of
course,
the
court
at
all
is
entirely
familiar
with
those
cases
where
one
negro
was
picked
on
the
grand
jury
in
18
years
and
one
in
24
or
one
out
of
600
and
that
sort
of
thing.
we
don't
think
that
that
situation
exists
here.
we
would
refer
to
the
case
of
swain
against
alabama,
where
the
--
i
think
the
overall
percentages
and
variances
and
what
not
are
not
a
great
deal
different
from
that
in
the
principal
case
and
this
court
upheld
that.
and
there
is
a
statement
in
swain
that
apparently
a
little
effort
in
alabama
was
made
to
ensure
that
all
groups
were
represented
upon
the
jury
list.
and
i
would
submit
that
under
our
practice
of
taking
them
from
a
registration
list
was
to
show
white
and
colored.
and
if
that
is
fairly
followed
that
that
would
be
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
there
are
representative
numbers
of
negroes
in
the
jury
box
and
then
you
mix
them
up
amd
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
say
that
if
that
is
followed
fairly.
take
two-thirds
as
our
statute
requires
of
all
eligible
male
electors
from
the
registration
votes.
even
if
you
take
two-thirds
colored
and
two-thirds
white
which
i
don't
think
would
be
entirely
proper
but
if
that
were
done,
what
complaint
could
be
made
if
they
are
all
put
in
the
box
and
mixed
up
and
thereafter
there's
no
opportunity
for
discrimination
as
i
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
by
the
actual
registration
itself.
yes
sir.
they're
of
course,
it
would
depend
on
that.
i
believe
there's
no
question
of
that
race
in
this
case
and
i
--
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
yes.
it
could
come
into
it
but
i
certainly
--
in
south
carolina
this
doesn't
exist.
now,
your
honor
as
far
as
prohibiting
anybody
from
registering
and
i'm
certain
that
counsel
here
will
assure
the
court
that
that
is
true.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
cheat,
you
want
to
be
crook,
there's
opportunity
and
there's
lots,
lots
of
places.
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
this
record
should
be
used
to
hang
the
first
jury
discrimination
case
around
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
one
up
until
now.
thank
you.
mr.
everett
n.
brandon
i
would
certainly
think
if
not
more
than
2,500
possibly
without
--
