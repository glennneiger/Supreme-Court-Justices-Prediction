mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
petitioner,
louis
bostick
was
convicted
of
murder
during
the
february,
1962
term
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
for
jasper
county,
south
carolina.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
later
affirmed
that
has
conviction
and
sentence
of
death.
thereafter,
petitioner
filed
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
for
richmond
county,
south
carolina
has
petitioned
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
that
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
and
the
trial
jury
which
convicted
him
were
so
conveying
as
to
systematically
exclude
there
from
members
of
the
negro
race
of
which
race
the
petitioner
is
a
member.
the
evidence
presented
on
this
question
is
perhaps
somewhat
brief
but
we
think
sustains
the
allegation
that
there
is
in
fact
discrimination
shown
by
the
record
here
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
has
been
set
forth.
that
evidence
is
that
for
a
period
described
variously
by
the
witnesses
ranging
from
eight
to
nine
years,
only
one
negro
in
the
memory
of
the
various
witnesses
had
been
called
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury
of
that
county.
the
evidence
also
is
that
in
1962
at
which
time
this
indictment
was
returned,
there
were
947
qualified
male
electors
in
jasper
county,
who
were
white,
and
that
there
246
qualified
negro
male
electors.
in
south
carolina,
jury
lists
are
made
up
from
the
list
of
qualified
male
electors.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they're
selected
pursuant
to
the
south
carolina
constitutional
provision
that
qualified
male
electors
that
is
to
say
males
over
the
age
of
21
and
less
than
the
age
of
65.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
of
court
mr.
sensenbach
set
forth
at
various
places
in
the
record
and
particularly
on
pages
66,
etcetera
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
oh,
yes.
well,
may
i
refer
you
mr.
justice
white
then
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
i
believe
sets
forth
more
succinctly
the
manner
in
which
the
juries
are
convened
in
that
state,
set
forth
that
page
118.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
once
a
year,
that
is
to
say,
in
the
month
of
december
of
each
year,
the
jury
commission
which
is
comprised
of
the
clerk
of
court,
the
treasurer
and
the
auditor
of
each
county
convene
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
the
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
for
the
ensuing
year,
and
prior
to
the
beginning
of
each
term
of
court
during
the
course
of
the
year.
the
jury
commission
likewise
convenes
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
the
various
venires.
during
that
december
meeting
of
the
jury
commission,
they
take
from
the
registration
roles
of
each
county
a
certain
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
the
racial
designation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they
know
that
because
race
is
clearly
designated
on
the
registration
duplicates.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
is
not
by
lot
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
it
is
random
but
the
jury
commission
is
required
by
the
law
to
select
two-thirds
of
the
qualified
male
electors
of
each
county.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
to
put
in
the
jury
box.
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
this
is
done
through
various
actions
on
the
part
of
the
jury
commission
based
upon
such
things
as
a
would-be
jurors
profession
such
things
as
the
feeling
that
he
is
possibly
not
qualified
by
reason
of
his
failure
to
possess
the
necessary
good
character
requirement.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
submit
that
the
record
here
indicates
an
opportunity
to
discriminate
on
race
as
was
found
by
this
court
in
avery
versus
georgia
from
that
factual
situation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
the
testimony
of
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
he
and
the
other
jury
commissioners
made
a
conscious
effort
to
maintain
a
certain
proportion
at
representation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
the
only
evidence
on
that
point
is
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
the
context
of
the
record
before
the
court
at
this
time
because
we
believe
that
this
record
establishes
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
based
upon
the
fact,
that
over
a
long
period
of
time,
only
one
negro
had
been
called
to
serve
upon
the
grand
jury
of
that
county.
and
based
upon
the
various
population
ratios
in
1960
for
example,
that
is
shown
by
the
1960
census
over
2,689
adult-white
persons
in
jasper
county,
south
carolina
and
that
there
were
3,333
negro
citizens
in
that
county.
and
that
of
the
qualified
male
electors
from
which
group
members
of
the
jury
are
selected
that
negroes
comprise
according
to
computation
set
forth
in
the
state's
brief
approximately
21%
of
the
total
persons
in
the
jury
box.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
think
the
record
supports
that
and
we
refer
the
court
to
pages
66
and
commencing
at
that
point
forward,
to
the
testimony
of
clerk
of
court,
mr.
sensenbach,
who
testified.
first
of
all,
that
there
was
one
negro
on
the
grand
jury
which
invaded
petitioner
during
the
february
1962
term
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
for
that
county.
now,
his
testimony
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
but
we
have
only
one
grand
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
for
the
entire
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
but
approximately
six
terms
of
the
court
convened
during
the
course
of
the
year.
now,
this
of
course
includes
the
civil
and
criminal
term.
i
believe
that
the
criminal
terms
in
that
particular
county
would
probably
not
be
more
than
three
terms.
they
--
a
winter
term,
a
summer
term,
and
a
fall
term.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
think
the
record
shows
contrary
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
refer
the
court
to
--
with
respect
to
the
1961
term
of
the
court,
to
the
bottom
of
page
66
and
the
top
of
page
67,
during
which
time
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
he
could
not
identify
any
negro
among
the
list
of
grand
jurors.
we
refer
the
court
to
about
the
middle
of
page
67,
where
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
he
could
not
identify
any
negro
on
the
grand
jury
for
1960.
go
to
the
bottom
of
page
67,
where
the
--
with
respect
to
the
1959
grand
jury,
the
clerk
of
court
thought
he
recognized
one
of
the
names
of
--
one
of
the
jurors
as
a
negro
but
stated
that
this
could
have
been
a
white
person
since
in
some
instances
in
that
county
some
negroes
have
the
same
names
of
which
some
white
persons
has.
so,
he
wasn't
positive
in
his
identification.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
if
you
will
go
back
to
page
68
of
the
top
of
the
page
with
respect
to
1958,
the
clerk
of
court
does
not
recognize
any
negro
included
on
the
grand
jury
during
that
term.
now,
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
submit
that
if
you
will
refer
fully
to
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
of
court
on
this
point,
it
was
perhaps
a
not
too
accurate
use
of
the
semantics
involved
on
the
part
of
the
interrogator
and
the
witness
himself.
in
giving
the
answer
to
that
question,
we
do
not
think
reflected
what
actually
is
seen
from
a
whole
reading
of
the
record
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
i
think
that
if
you
will
look
at
the
testimony
of
another
witness
who
testified
that
he
have
visited
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
involves
negroes
on
the
grand
juries
prior
to
1958.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
this
is
what
we
think
is
reflected
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
february
1962
term
at
which
time
this
petitioner
was
indicted
and
of
course
presumably
throughout
the
entire
year
of
1962.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
the
only
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
the
record
also
substantiates
the
statement
that
in
1954
in
another
case,
a
south
carolina
circuit
judge
questioned
indictment
upon
the
ground
of
discrimination
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
juries
of
that
county.
and
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
the
jury
commission
had
done
nothing
since
that
time
to
change
the
manner
in
which
they
made
up
their
jury
box.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
and
hugh
banks
and
then
in
o'connell
would
still
be
applicable.
thank
you.
we
think,
therefore,
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
here
of
discrimination
and
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
not
met
that
prima
facie
case
by
any
evidence
which
removes
the
prima
facie
showing
which
we
have
made.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
except
for
reference
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
sets
forth
the
procedure
in
making
up
the
jury
lists
in
south
carolina
and
except
for
reference
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
sensenbach,
the
clerk
of
court,
the
record
is
otherwise
silent
concerning
the
exact
mechanics.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
do.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
because
mr.
sensenbach
testified
variously
having
reduced
himself
from
any
inference
of
any
discriminatory
purpose.
he
testified
that
notwithstanding
this
fact
that
there
had
been
only
one
negro
call
for
the
service
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
believe,
of
course,
that
his
protestations
to
the
contrary
removed
the
clear
inference
shown
by
this
record.
i
call
to
your
attention
also
the
fact
that
mr.
sensenbach
testified
that
he
knew
immediately
when
he
observed
the
name
of
the
prospective
juror,
the
race
of
that
juror,
that
he
also
knew
where
they
lived
in
the
county.
now,
we
think
of
course,
looking
at
the
entire
record
on
this
point,
the
conclusion
is
apparent
that
the
opportunity
to
discriminate
was
clear.
we
think,
of
course,
certainly
we
didn't
have
tax
records
which
were
mocked
different
colors
as
well
as
the
case
in
avery
versus
georgia
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
did
have
registered
voter
lists
which
designated
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
i
merely
--
i
merely
point
out
that
in
--
well,
in
whitus
of
course
you
have
a
situation
i
think
of
course,
analogous
to
--
in
avery
versus
georgia
where
the
state
of
georgia
pursued
a
system
of
requiring
different
colored
tax
slips
based
upon
race.
now
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
and
add
to
that
the
fact
that
the
--
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
immediately
recognizes
the
name
of
a
would-be
juror
as
a
negro.
except
in
some
few
instances
where
negroes
and
whites
might
have
the
same
name.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
believe
that
looking
at
the
entire
record
that
when
we
add
to
the
fact
that
only
one
negro
has
been
called
for
service
on
the
grand
jury
and
you
add
to
that
fact
that
the
states
has
required
the
registrants
to
be
identified
by
race,
and
add
to
that
the
further
fact
that
the
--
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
can
immediately
identify
the
would-be
juror
by
his
race.
all
of
those
things
taken
together
perhaps
to
paraphrase
this
court's
handling
of
confession
matters,
the
totality
of
all
of
the
circumstances,
we
think
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
the
court
has
certainly
observed
that
the
constitution
not
only
prohibits
exclusion
but
it
prohibits
discriminatory
inclusion.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
i
would
argue
in
favor
of
exact
proportionate
representation.
i
merely
say
that
on
the
fact
here,
we
think
of
course,
that
we
have
discrimination
affirmatively
shown
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
record
supports
that
position.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
few
words
in
reply.
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
30
--
page
29
of
the
transcript
of
record
with
respect
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness
of
willie
martin?
mr.
martin
have
testified
that
he
have
been
attending
the
courts
for
eight
or
nine
years
and
that
during
this
entire
period,
he
had
seen
only
one
negro
serving
on
the
grand
jury
and
that
was
during
the
february
1962
term
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
for
jasper
county.
he
--
this
witness
placed
to
the
highest
number
of
negroes
who
served
on
the
petty
jury
of
that
county
at
two.
this
testimony
also
appears
at
page
29.
and
over
on
page
67,
the
bottom
of
page
67
and
on
the
top
of
page
68,
where
the
witness
mr.
sensenbach
referring
to
the
grand
and
petty
juries
for
1959,
there
has
been
some
question
about
whether
there
were
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
during
that
period.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
1959,
i
believe
at
the
bottom
of
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
going
over
to
the
top
of
page
68,
mr.
sensenbach
answered
the
question
concerning
the
inclusion
of
two
names
on
the
1959
jury,
whom
he
recognized
as
negroes.
at
the
top
of
page
68,
the
question
was,
“and
you
identified
those
as
being
on
the
petty
jury?
his
answer
was,
“that
is
right
sir.”
so,
this
record
does
not
support
the
statement
that
there
were
at
any
time
more
than
--
that
there
were
any
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
during
any
period
other
than
during
the
1962
grand
jury
which
indicted
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
--
that
certainly
might
arise
some
doubt
concerning
the
weight
which
the
court
might
like
to
put
on
that
testimony.
but
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
and
over
on
page
30
of
the
transcript,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
south
carolina
in
cross-examining
this
witness
and
in
endeavoring
to
make
him
more
specific
inquired
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
lower
middle
of
the
page,
“was
there
anything
unusual
about
this
particular
trial?”
he
said,
“unusual?”
the
question
is
in
reference
to
other
trials
and
the
answer
of
the
witness
was,
“just
one
negro
was
on
the
grand
jury
that
is
all
that
was
unusual.”
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
sir,
we
submit
that
it
is
evidence
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
grand
jury
comes
out
and
makes
its
reports
in
the
open
courtroom
and
of
course
spectators
can
indeed
ascertain
the
make
up
of
the
grand
jury.
there
they're
when
they're
being
given
the
charges
in
the
case,
when
they're
being
handed
with
newly
prepared
indictments
and
they
come
out
periodically
to
report
their
findings
to
the
court.
and
any
spectator
in
the
court
can
readily
ascertain
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
richland
i
believe
the
county
seat
is
the
largest
city
in
that
county.i
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
recall
that.
perhaps
mr.
brandon
can
assist
us
with
it
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
comforts
with
my
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well
of
course,
the
schools
have
been
improving
to
some
extent
but
i'm
afraid
that
they
got
a
long
way
to
go.
we
are
of
course
concerned
in
some
respects
with
the
schools
of
that
county
now.
they
of
course
--
they
failed
to
put
it
mildly
sir.
so
gentlemen
of
the
court,
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
the
petitioner
here
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
just
as
was
the
case
in
whitus
versus
georgia.
and
just
as
was
the
case
in
whitus
versus
georgia,
the
state
here
has
not
come
in
and
offered
any
comfort
of
evidence
to
meet
or
to
disprove
the
prima
facie
case
which
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
whitus
was
decided
since
we
submitted
the
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
petitioner,
louis
bostick
was
convicted
of
murder
during
the
february,
1962
term
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
for
jasper
county,
south
carolina.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
later
affirmed
that
has
conviction
and
sentence
of
death.
thereafter,
petitioner
filed
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
for
richmond
county,
south
carolina
has
petitioned
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
that
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
and
the
trial
jury
which
convicted
him
were
so
conveying
as
to
systematically
exclude
there
from
members
of
the
negro
race
of
which
race
the
petitioner
is
a
member.
the
evidence
presented
on
this
question
is
perhaps
somewhat
brief
but
we
think
sustains
the
allegation
that
there
is
in
fact
discrimination
shown
by
the
record
here
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
has
been
set
forth.
that
evidence
is
that
for
a
period
described
variously
by
the
witnesses
ranging
from
eight
to
nine
years,
only
one
negro
in
the
memory
of
the
various
witnesses
had
been
called
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury
of
that
county.
the
evidence
also
is
that
in
1962
at
which
time
this
indictment
was
returned,
there
were
947
qualified
male
electors
in
jasper
county,
who
were
white,
and
that
there
246
qualified
negro
male
electors.
in
south
carolina,
jury
lists
are
made
up
from
the
list
of
qualified
male
electors.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they're
selected
pursuant
to
the
south
carolina
constitutional
provision
that
qualified
male
electors
that
is
to
say
males
over
the
age
of
21
and
less
than
the
age
of
65.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
of
court
mr.
sensenbach
set
forth
at
various
places
in
the
record
and
particularly
on
pages
66,
etcetera
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
oh,
yes.
well,
may
i
refer
you
mr.
justice
white
then
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
i
believe
sets
forth
more
succinctly
the
manner
in
which
the
juries
are
convened
in
that
state,
set
forth
that
page
118.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
once
a
year,
that
is
to
say,
in
the
month
of
december
of
each
year,
the
jury
commission
which
is
comprised
of
the
clerk
of
court,
the
treasurer
and
the
auditor
of
each
county
convene
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
the
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
for
the
ensuing
year,
and
prior
to
the
beginning
of
each
term
of
court
during
the
course
of
the
year.
the
jury
commission
likewise
convenes
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
the
various
venires.
during
that
december
meeting
of
the
jury
commission,
they
take
from
the
registration
roles
of
each
county
a
certain
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
the
racial
designation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they
know
that
because
race
is
clearly
designated
on
the
registration
duplicates.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
is
not
by
lot
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
it
is
random
but
the
jury
commission
is
required
by
the
law
to
select
two-thirds
of
the
qualified
male
electors
of
each
county.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
to
put
in
the
jury
box.
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
this
is
done
through
various
actions
on
the
part
of
the
jury
commission
based
upon
such
things
as
a
would-be
jurors
profession
such
things
as
the
feeling
that
he
is
possibly
not
qualified
by
reason
of
his
failure
to
possess
the
necessary
good
character
requirement.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
submit
that
the
record
here
indicates
an
opportunity
to
discriminate
on
race
as
was
found
by
this
court
in
avery
versus
georgia
from
that
factual
situation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
the
testimony
of
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
he
and
the
other
jury
commissioners
made
a
conscious
effort
to
maintain
a
certain
proportion
at
representation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
the
only
evidence
on
that
point
is
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
the
context
of
the
record
before
the
court
at
this
time
because
we
believe
that
this
record
establishes
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
based
upon
the
fact,
that
over
a
long
period
of
time,
only
one
negro
had
been
called
to
serve
upon
the
grand
jury
of
that
county.
and
based
upon
the
various
population
ratios
in
1960
for
example,
that
is
shown
by
the
1960
census
over
2,689
adult-white
persons
in
jasper
county,
south
carolina
and
that
there
were
3,333
negro
citizens
in
that
county.
and
that
of
the
qualified
male
electors
from
which
group
members
of
the
jury
are
selected
that
negroes
comprise
according
to
computation
set
forth
in
the
state's
brief
approximately
21%
of
the
total
persons
in
the
jury
box.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
think
the
record
supports
that
and
we
refer
the
court
to
pages
66
and
commencing
at
that
point
forward,
to
the
testimony
of
clerk
of
court,
mr.
sensenbach,
who
testified.
first
of
all,
that
there
was
one
negro
on
the
grand
jury
which
invaded
petitioner
during
the
february
1962
term
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
for
that
county.
now,
his
testimony
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
but
we
have
only
one
grand
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
for
the
entire
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
but
approximately
six
terms
of
the
court
convened
during
the
course
of
the
year.
now,
this
of
course
includes
the
civil
and
criminal
term.
i
believe
that
the
criminal
terms
in
that
particular
county
would
probably
not
be
more
than
three
terms.
they
--
a
winter
term,
a
summer
term,
and
a
fall
term.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
think
the
record
shows
contrary
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
refer
the
court
to
--
with
respect
to
the
1961
term
of
the
court,
to
the
bottom
of
page
66
and
the
top
of
page
67,
during
which
time
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
he
could
not
identify
any
negro
among
the
list
of
grand
jurors.
we
refer
the
court
to
about
the
middle
of
page
67,
where
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
he
could
not
identify
any
negro
on
the
grand
jury
for
1960.
go
to
the
bottom
of
page
67,
where
the
--
with
respect
to
the
1959
grand
jury,
the
clerk
of
court
thought
he
recognized
one
of
the
names
of
--
one
of
the
jurors
as
a
negro
but
stated
that
this
could
have
been
a
white
person
since
in
some
instances
in
that
county
some
negroes
have
the
same
names
of
which
some
white
persons
has.
so,
he
wasn't
positive
in
his
identification.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
if
you
will
go
back
to
page
68
of
the
top
of
the
page
with
respect
to
1958,
the
clerk
of
court
does
not
recognize
any
negro
included
on
the
grand
jury
during
that
term.
now,
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
submit
that
if
you
will
refer
fully
to
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
of
court
on
this
point,
it
was
perhaps
a
not
too
accurate
use
of
the
semantics
involved
on
the
part
of
the
interrogator
and
the
witness
himself.
in
giving
the
answer
to
that
question,
we
do
not
think
reflected
what
actually
is
seen
from
a
whole
reading
of
the
record
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
i
think
that
if
you
will
look
at
the
testimony
of
another
witness
who
testified
that
he
have
visited
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
involves
negroes
on
the
grand
juries
prior
to
1958.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
this
is
what
we
think
is
reflected
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
february
1962
term
at
which
time
this
petitioner
was
indicted
and
of
course
presumably
throughout
the
entire
year
of
1962.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
the
only
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
the
record
also
substantiates
the
statement
that
in
1954
in
another
case,
a
south
carolina
circuit
judge
questioned
indictment
upon
the
ground
of
discrimination
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
juries
of
that
county.
and
the
clerk
of
court
testified
that
the
jury
commission
had
done
nothing
since
that
time
to
change
the
manner
in
which
they
made
up
their
jury
box.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
and
hugh
banks
and
then
in
o'connell
would
still
be
applicable.
thank
you.
we
think,
therefore,
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
here
of
discrimination
and
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
not
met
that
prima
facie
case
by
any
evidence
which
removes
the
prima
facie
showing
which
we
have
made.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
except
for
reference
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
which
sets
forth
the
procedure
in
making
up
the
jury
lists
in
south
carolina
and
except
for
reference
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
sensenbach,
the
clerk
of
court,
the
record
is
otherwise
silent
concerning
the
exact
mechanics.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
do.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
because
mr.
sensenbach
testified
variously
having
reduced
himself
from
any
inference
of
any
discriminatory
purpose.
he
testified
that
notwithstanding
this
fact
that
there
had
been
only
one
negro
call
for
the
service
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
believe,
of
course,
that
his
protestations
to
the
contrary
removed
the
clear
inference
shown
by
this
record.
i
call
to
your
attention
also
the
fact
that
mr.
sensenbach
testified
that
he
knew
immediately
when
he
observed
the
name
of
the
prospective
juror,
the
race
of
that
juror,
that
he
also
knew
where
they
lived
in
the
county.
now,
we
think
of
course,
looking
at
the
entire
record
on
this
point,
the
conclusion
is
apparent
that
the
opportunity
to
discriminate
was
clear.
we
think,
of
course,
certainly
we
didn't
have
tax
records
which
were
mocked
different
colors
as
well
as
the
case
in
avery
versus
georgia
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
did
have
registered
voter
lists
which
designated
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
i
merely
--
i
merely
point
out
that
in
--
well,
in
whitus
of
course
you
have
a
situation
i
think
of
course,
analogous
to
--
in
avery
versus
georgia
where
the
state
of
georgia
pursued
a
system
of
requiring
different
colored
tax
slips
based
upon
race.
now
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
and
add
to
that
the
fact
that
the
--
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
immediately
recognizes
the
name
of
a
would-be
juror
as
a
negro.
except
in
some
few
instances
where
negroes
and
whites
might
have
the
same
name.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
believe
that
looking
at
the
entire
record
that
when
we
add
to
the
fact
that
only
one
negro
has
been
called
for
service
on
the
grand
jury
and
you
add
to
that
fact
that
the
states
has
required
the
registrants
to
be
identified
by
race,
and
add
to
that
the
further
fact
that
the
--
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
can
immediately
identify
the
would-be
juror
by
his
race.
all
of
those
things
taken
together
perhaps
to
paraphrase
this
court's
handling
of
confession
matters,
the
totality
of
all
of
the
circumstances,
we
think
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course,
the
court
has
certainly
observed
that
the
constitution
not
only
prohibits
exclusion
but
it
prohibits
discriminatory
inclusion.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
i
would
argue
in
favor
of
exact
proportionate
representation.
i
merely
say
that
on
the
fact
here,
we
think
of
course,
that
we
have
discrimination
affirmatively
shown
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
record
supports
that
position.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.

justice,

it
please

question
concerning
the
inclusion
of
two
names
on
the
1959
jury,
whom
he
recognized
as
negroes.
at
the
top
of
page
68,
the
question
was,
“and
you
identified
those
as
being
on
the
petty
jury?
his
answer
was,
“that
is
right
sir.”
so,
this
record
does
not
support
the
statement
that
there
were
at
any
time
more
than
--
that
there
were
any
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
during
any
period
other
than
during
the
1962
grand
jury
which
indicted
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
--
that
certainly
might
arise
some
doubt
concerning
the
weight
which
the
court
might
like
to
put
on
that
testimony.
but
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
and
over
on
page
30
of
the
transcript,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
south
carolina
in
cross-examining
this
witness
and
in
endeavoring
to
make
him
more
specific
inquired
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
lower
middle
of
the
page,
“was
there
anything
unusual
about
this
particular
trial?”
he
said,
“unusual?”
the
question
is
in
reference
to
other
trials
and
the
answer
of
the
witness
was,
“just
one
negro
was
on
the
grand
jury
that
is
all
that
was
unusual.”
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
sir,
we
submit
that
it
is
evidence
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
grand
jury
comes
out
and
makes
its
reports
in
the
open
courtroom
and
of
course
spectators
can
indeed
ascertain
the
make
up
of
the
grand
jury.
there
they're
when
they're
being
given
the
charges
in
the
case,
when
they're
being
handed
with
newly
prepared
indictments
and
they
come
out
periodically
to
report
their
findings
to
the
court.
and
any
spectator
in
the
court
can
readily
ascertain
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
richland
i
believe
the
county
seat
is
the
largest
city
in
that
county.i
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
recall
that.
perhaps
mr.
brandon
can
assist
us
with
it
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
comforts
with
my
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well
of
course,
the
schools
have
been
improving
to
some
extent
but
i'm
afraid
that
they
got
a
long
way
to
go.
we
are
of
course
concerned
in
some
respects
with
the
schools
of
that
county
now.
they
of
course
--
they
failed
to
put
it
mildly
sir.
so
gentlemen
of
the
court,
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
the
petitioner
here
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
just
as
was
the
case
in
whitus
versus
georgia.
and
just
as
was
the
case
in
whitus
versus
georgia,
the
state
here
has
not
come
in
and
offered
any
comfort
of
evidence
to
meet
or
to
disprove
the
prima
facie
case
which
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
whitus
was
decided
since
we
submitted
the
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
sir.
