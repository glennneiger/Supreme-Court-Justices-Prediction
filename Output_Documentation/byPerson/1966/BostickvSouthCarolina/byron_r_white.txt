justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
they
made
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
contain
how
it
directly
chose
physically,
how
they
select
the
names
from
the
registered
voters
list?
it
is
the
voters
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
they
go
about
that?
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
it
doesn't
--
it
--
they
never
get
around
to
say
how
exactly
how
they
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
they
have
a
list
of
registered
voters,
what
mechanical
process
--
what
process
do
they
go
through
to
actually
select
the
--
a
portion
of
the
male
electors
from
that
registered
voters
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
actually
have
roles
before
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
names
on
it
and
their
addresses?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
racial
designation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
know
--
they
know
the
race
of
those
of
the
people
whom
they
collect
from
the
registered
voters
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
one
of
this
is
not
by
lot
of
them
--
of
the
--
of
that
list,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
is
by
any
--
every
tenth
name
or
every
second
name
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
random
choice
of
the
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
to
put
it
--
to
put
in
the
jury
box.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
how
they
go
about
throwing
out
the
one-third?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
--
is
there
any
testimony
to
show
actually
what
proportion
of
negroes
and
whites
actually
got
into
the
jury
box?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
select
the
two-thirds
out
of
--
of
the
jury
off
of
the
registered
voters
list,
once
that
two-third
goes
into
the
jury
box
that,
they
could
be
proportioned
there
in
the
jury
box?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
know
you
say
that
even
if
that
so,
that's
invalid
selection
but
do
you
accept
the
fact
they
did
put
into
proportion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
accept
or
do
you
accept
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
care
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
had
--
you
had
registered
voters
list
which
designated
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
why
in
this
--
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
whitus?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
source
of
jury
name
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
they
have
a
registered
voters
list
that
separates
negroes
and
whites.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
argue
--
you
would
argue
any
time
that
the
jury
commissioner
is
that
familiar
with
the
--
with
the
electorate
that
there's
the
invalidity
if
there
is
not
enough
negroes
on
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
if
on
every
jury
panel
there
was
the
exact
proportion
of
negroes
and
whites
proportionate
to
the
numbers
on
the
jury
--
on
the
registered
voters
list,
what
would
you
say
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
it's
designated
with
which
race
they
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
just
take
everyone
that
comes
along?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
in
the
selection
of
the
names
that
go
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
in
whitus?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
why
is
it
--
why
is
it
the
segregated
pack
list
in
whitus,
the
equivalent
of
the
racially
designated
registered
voters
list
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
but
why
should
that
make
a
difference
as
long
as
if
you
can
held
when
they
come
to
the
designations
in
the
race
of
the
various
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
suggest
to
that
person
--
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
that
purpose
was
achieved
here,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
any
proportion
of
representation
of
negroes
on
the
jury
panel,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
proportion
of
negroes
on
the
jury
box?
what
was
the
proportion
of
the
male
negro
registered
--
of
the
qualified
male
negro
out
of
the
total,
four
to
one?
is
it
four
to
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
about
20%?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
with
20%
on
the
panel
of
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it's
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
they
made
up?
justice
byron

white
it
doesn't

it
--
they

with
the
names
on
it
and
their
addresses?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
racial
designation?
justice
byron

white
so,
they
know
--
they
know
the
race
of
those
of
the
people
whom
they
collect
from
the
registered
voters
list?
justice

alright,
to
put
it
--
to
put
in

justice
byron

so,
how
they
go
about
throwing
out
the
one-third?

how
about
race?
justice
