justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
perry
in
the
middle
of
68,
is
the
question
whether
you've
seen
the
grand
jury
sitting
since
1958
with
more
than
one
negro
sitting
on
that
jury
or
more
than
five
is
that
your
--
i
don't
think
more
than
five.
i
don't
think
in
a
grand
jury
there's
been
more
than
one
or
two
at
any
one
term
that
i
can
recall.
are
we
to
take
that
to
say
that
since
‘58
in
each
term
there
has
been
at
least
one
or
maybe
two
each
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
position
is,
are
we
dealing
now
since
1958
this
record
covered
only
since
1958,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
--
i
wonder
if
you
could
tell
me
sir,
are
we
dealing
only
with
the
situation
since
1958
or
does
this
record
involved
negroes
on
the
grand
juries
prior
to
1958?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
is
it
--
it's
your
position
i
gather
that
prior
and
since
1958
the
whole
period
there
only
been
one
in
all
that
time,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
and
one
--
some
one
of
those
terms
which
term,
do
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
time,
there
was
one
and
that's
the
only
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
up
until
then
that's
there
never
been
a
negro
in
the
grand
jury,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
perry,
if
we
would
have
think
that
this
record
justified
a
conclusion
that
at
least
one
on
the
grand
jury
for
each
year
at
least
since
1958
as
what
the
evidence
showed,
would
that
change
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
each
term
mr.
brandon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
set
in
1958
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brandon,
would
you
tell
us
something
i
don't
know
whether
the
records
clearly
shows
that
what
actually
happened
when
they
take
the
electors'
list,
what
would-be
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brandon,
why
is
it
this
then
the
same
problem
we
had
in
whitus,
if
we
decided
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
i
read
something
in
68.
