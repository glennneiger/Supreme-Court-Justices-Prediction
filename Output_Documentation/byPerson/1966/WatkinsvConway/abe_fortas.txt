this
one
is
a
procedure
in
georgia
on
foreign
judgments?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
georgia
law
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
in
which,
as
you
put
it,
convert
the
foreign
judgment
into
a
georgia
judgment,
what
sort
of
issues
can
be
raised?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
fact
that
you
have
that
proceeding
in
relation
to
levying
a
permanent
judgment
supply
any
rationale
or
adequate
basis
for
the
distinction
in
terms
of
time?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
is
really
the
question
whether
there
is
a
reason
for
the
distinction?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
does
georgia
have
any
different
statute
of
limitations
for
the
enforcement
of
domestic
judgments
or
is
that
just
one
overall
that
applies
to
all
kinds
of
judgments?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
does
it
apply
to
all
judgments
and
there's
no
special
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
there
are
no
special
statutes
differentiating
among
types
of
judgments?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
make
any
contention
that
a
five-year
period
of
limitations
standing
alone
is
unreasonable?
