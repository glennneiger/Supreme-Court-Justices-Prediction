mr.
martin
mcfarland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
respect
of
this
case,
the
facts
are
quite
brief
and
i
would
like
to
allude
to
the
facts
briefly
and
that
is
to
say
this.
prior
to
1952,
conway,
the
appellee,
operated
a
trucking
business
in
florida.
one
of
his
agents
had
a
wreck.
in
1952,
he
was
sued;
a
verdict
was
obtained
in
1952
on
the
personsla
injuries.
that
verdict
was
allowed
to
stand
until
october
1955.
there
was
no
judgment
entered
on
the
verdict
for
some
three
years.
i
say
that
that
is
sadly
indolence
on
the
appellant
here.
then,
they
waited
another
period
from
1955
until
1960,
more
than
five
years
before
they
proceeded
to
bring
suit
on
the
florida
judgment.
that
is
some
eight
years,
i
would
say,
of
indolence,
but
nevertheless,
they
didn't
bring
their
suit.
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
“what
is
the
procedure”?
this
suit
consisted
of
one
page,
a
one-page
petition
with
procex,
merely
alleging
the
parties,
that
conway
was
a
resident
of
georgia,
that
he
had
obtained
the
judgment
in
florida
for
x
dollars,
wherefore
and
prayed
for
of
the
georgia
judgment.
they
waited
five
years,
more
than
five
years
to
do
this,
but
they
did
it.
at
that
time,
we
then,
by
virtue
of
this
code
section
3-701
which
is
now
the
question,
we
filed
a
plea
of
statute
of
limitations
as
provided
by
this
section.
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
brought.
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county,
georgia
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
appellant
appealed
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
our
statute
and
hence,
the
appellant
is
here.
i
would
like
to
say
this
briefly
that
is,
as
far
as
the
u.s.
cases
are
concerned
in
beacon
versus
harwood,
20
harwood
page
22,
sherman
versus
cutsley
in
illinois,
make
versus
meek,
iowa,
talyor
versus
joe
in
louisiana,
little
versus
mcveigh,
new
jersey
and
pear
versus
gibb,
south
carolina,
praia
versus
moore
from
texas.
this
principle
of
law
was
held
in
each
of
those
cases
and
i
have
the
page
citations
cited
in
my
brief.
“full
and
faith
credit
to
be
given
judgments
of
other
states
is
not
voilated
by
reasonable
period
of
limitation
upon
the
bringing
of
said
suits”.
then
of
course,
i
consider
these
landmark
cases,
the
great
western
telegraph
versus
purdy
in
162
u.s.
page
329,
metcalf
versus
city
of
watertown,
153
u.s.
of
671.
as
i
cited
in
my
brief,
it
is
well-established
that
a
statute
limiting
the
time
within
which
an
action
may
be
brought
on
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
a
sister
state,
does
not
voilate
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
we
have
those
recent
holdings
as
a
guideline.
then,
of
course,
we
cite
in
our
brief
additional
cases.
for
instance,
randoff
versus
king,
a
104
federal
cases
11560
and
various
other
cases,
including
a
case
from
tennessee
which
is
(inaudible).
and
(inaudible)
actually
antedated
the
mcelmoyle
versus
cohen,
38
us,
page
312
and
there
this
principle
of
law
was
adhered
to
as
i
set
forth
in
the
brief.
the
contention
that
the
statute
of
limitations
as
to
a
suit
on
a
foreign
judgment
violated
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
has
been
expressly
overruled.
so,
we
have
a
number
of
the
authoritiries
that
our
definite
guidelines
so
far
as
the
issue
raised
in
his
question
no.
1
as
cited
in
his
brief.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
can't
positively
say
but
i
would
--
my
best
judgment
leads
me
to
believe
that
it
is
tremendously
old
statute.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
yes,
just
like
the
five
years.
now,
then
we
come
to
this
juncture
of
the
case.
certainly,
the
forum
state
can
apply
its
own
statute
of
limitations
as
to
a
foreign
judgment.
now,
in
this
m'elmoyle
case
versus
cohen,
the
court
in
making
this
holding
based
its
reasoning
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
a
plea
to
the
remedy.
it
was
not
a
plea
to
the
merits.
it
is
a
procedural
proposition
and
consequently,
would
bar
the
cause
of
action.
now,
my
brother,
he
cites
the
wells
cases
and
the
simons
cases,
but
that
is
an
entirely
different
proposition
and
i
so
argued
on
my
brief.
he's
talking
about
there
about
a
case
involving
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
have
the
right
to
bring
a
tort
action.
here,
this
is
entirely
different.
we're
talking
about
a
procedural
matter,
a
question
going
to
the
remedy
not
merits.
now,
i
think
that
so
far
as
the
holdings
of
this
court,
the
holdings
of
the
many
cases
throughout
the
several
states
that
has
the
effect
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
violated
by
the
full
faith
and
credit,
defer
the
fact
that
we
do
have
the
right
as
a
state
to
impose
a
period
of
limitation
upon
foreign
judgments
as
a
class.
there's
no
disfavouring
there.
it
applies
to
all
such
foreign
judgments,
none
excluding.
now,
in
getting
into
the
question
about
the
period
of
limitations,
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
and
quote
the
exact
code
sections
of
our
law
respecting
the
statute
of
limitations
so
that
there
be
no
question
about
them.
insofar
as
domestic
judgments
are
concerned,
if
we
have
a
georgia
domestic
judgment,
the
period
of
limitation
is
seven
years
period.
now,
after
that
period
of
seven
years,
this
judgment
becomes
dormant.
i
will
further
say
that
during
this
period,
anytime
within
three
years,
the
judgment
holder
can
then
bring
a
petition
or
writ
of
scire
facias
and
in
this
three-year
dormant
period,
may
revive
his
dormant
seven-year
old
judgment
for
an
additional
three-year
period.
now,
getting
away
from
that
proposition
so
far
as
the
domestic
judgment
is
concerned,
let's
take
the
georgia
judgment
of
seven
years.
if
this
holder
of
the
judgment
causes
it
to
be
levied
and
an
entry
of
the
sheriff
made
upon
the
georgia
judgment
and
placed
upon
the
general
execution
docket,
then
that
state
of
facts
would
revive
the
judgment
for
seven
years
without
the
necessity
of
bringing
the
writ
of
scire
facias.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
it
is
not
an
irrational
proceeding,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
martin
mcfarland
yes,
it's
an
ancillary
proceeding.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
oh!
yes,
sir.
it
is
an
adversary
proceeding
in
this
respect.
it
must
be
done
by
a
petition
in
process
and
served
upon
the
defendant
in
five
days
or
the
defendant
in
judgment.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
i
would
assume
that
technically
it
would
be
such
defenses
that
would
be
only
as
to
a
judgment
such
as
fraud
in
his
procurement
and
things
of
those
natures.
now,
then
so
much
for
the
periods
of
limitation
our
domestic
judgments.
now,
as
to
all
foreign
judgments,
our
statute
provides
a
reasonable
period
of
time:
five
years.
i
called
to
the
court's
attention
as
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
the
case
of
(inaudible).
this
case
arose
from
the
state
of
mississippi
and
this
court
held
that
to
be
unconstitutional
and
the
reason
and
justly
so.
the
period
of
limitation
on
foreign
judgments
in
the
state
of
mississippi
is
cited
in
the
(inaudible)
case
was
merely
three
months.
certainly,
it
should
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
because
the
time
was
certainly
not
reasonable.
but
we
submit
that
the
five-year
period
as
to
all
such
foreign
judgments
is
certainly
reasonable.
here,
we
have
an
indolent
appellant
that
is
wasted
eight
years
and
the
only
thing
they
do
now
is
seek
to
attack
our
code
section
as
being
unconstitutional
unquestionably
as
we
are
again
our
brief
by
reason
of
that
indolence.
so
we
say
that
here
we
have
a
question
of
procedure.
here
we
have
a
question
of
remedy
and
not
a
question
of
merits.
so
then,
would
it
not
be
proper
to
ask
the
question
insofar
as
this
state
statute
is
concerned?
is
it
reasonable
in
character?
is
five
years
a
reasonable
time?
we
contend
vigorously
that
it
is.
take
for
instance
this
proposition.
i
cited
in
the
motion
to
affirm
the
fact
that
in
florida
from
whence
this
judgment
comes,
florida
limitation
period
on
domestic
judgments
is
20
years.
their
period
of
limitation
on
foreign
judgments
is
seven
years.
now,
even
taken
by
their
own
state,
georgia
from
a
presented
standpoint
is
far
more
magnanimous
in
its
period
of
time
than
florida.
that's
five
as
compared
to
seven.
so,
we
say
this.
we
say
that
our
code
section
of
five
years
is
reasonable.
it
certainly
affords
a
period
of
time,
a
reasonable
period
of
time
in
which
the
appellant
to
bring
such
a
suit.
we
say
this
that
the
appellant
in
his
brief
has
stated,
surely
you
have
the
right
to
pass
such
a
statute
that
has
been
no
question
raised
–
pointed
out
in
my
brother's
brief
wherein
the
statute
of
five
years
is
unreasonable,
no;
that
the
state
of
georgia
has
no
right
to
pass
such
a
statute.
i
might
say
in
closing
that
these
particular
statutes
are
very
common
throughout
the
nation
and
justly
so,
so
that
a
man
may
know
where
his
plea
stands
so
far
as
his
rights
are
concerned
and
his
responsibilities
and
in
these
numbers
of
states
of
the
union
in
which
i
have
cited
wherein
it
is
not
violative
of
the
full
faith
and
credit,
we
say
that
it
is
not
discriminatory
nor
has
the
appellant
pointed
in
any
particular
phase
wherein
it
is
discriminatory
and
we,
therefore,
ask
this
honorable
court
to
declare
this
code
section
constitutional.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
yes,
your
honor
but
under
the
m'elmoyle
case,
i
believe
–
mr.
martin
mcfarland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
respect
of
this
case,
the
facts
are
quite
brief
and
i
would
like
to
allude
to
the
facts
briefly
and
that
is
to
say
this.
prior

conway,

that

was
allowed
to
stand
until
october
1955.
there
was
no
judgment
entered
on
the
verdict
for
some
three
years.
i
say
that
that
is
sadly
indolence
on
the
appellant
here.
then,
they
waited
another
period
from
1955
until
1960,
more
than
five
years
before
they
proceeded
to
bring
suit
on
the
florida
judgment.
that
is
some
eight

i
would

at

we
filed

limitation
is
seven
years
period.
now,
after
that
period
of
seven
years,
this
judgment
becomes
dormant.
i
will
further
say
that
during
this
period,
anytime
within
three
years,
the
judgment
holder
can
then
bring
a
petition
or
writ
of
scire
facias
and
in
this
three-year
dormant
period,
may
revive
his
dormant
seven-year
old
judgment
for
an
additional
three-year
period.
now,
getting
away
from
that
proposition
so
far
as
the
domestic
judgment
is
concerned,
let's
take
the
georgia
judgment
of
seven
years.
if
this
holder
of
the
judgment
causes
it
to
be
levied
and
an
entry
of
the
sheriff
made
upon
the
georgia
judgment
and
placed
upon
the
general
execution
docket,
then
that
state
of
facts
would
revive
the
judgment
for
seven
years
without
the
necessity
of
bringing
the
writ
of
scire
facias.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
it
is
not
an
irrational
proceeding,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
martin
mcfarland
yes,
it's
an
ancillary
proceeding.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
oh!
yes,
sir.
it
is
an
adversary
proceeding
in
this
respect.
it
must
be
done
by
a
petition
in
process
and
served
upon
the
defendant
in
five
days
or
the
defendant
in
judgment.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
i
would
assume
that
technically
it
would
be
such
defenses
that
would
be
only
as
to
a
judgment
such
as
fraud
in
his
procurement
and
things
of
those
natures.
now,
then
so
much
for
the
periods
of
limitation
our
domestic
judgments.
now,
as
to
all
foreign
judgments,
our
statute
provides
a
reasonable
period
of
time:
five
years.
i
called
to
the
court's
attention
as
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
the
case
of
(inaudible).
this
case
arose
from
the
state
of
mississippi
and
this
court
held
that
to
be
unconstitutional
and
the
reason
and
justly
so.
the
period
of
limitation
on
foreign
judgments
in
the
state
of
mississippi
is
cited
in
the
(inaudible)
case
was
merely
three
months.
certainly,
it
should
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
because
the
time
was
certainly
not
reasonable.
but
we
submit
that
the
five-year
period
as
to
all
such
foreign
judgments
is
certainly
reasonable.
here,
we
have
an
indolent
appellant
that
is
wasted
eight
years
and
the
only
thing
they
do
now
is
seek
to
attack
our
code
section
as
being
unconstitutional
unquestionably
as
we
are
again
our
brief
by
reason
of
that
indolence.
so
we
say
that
here
we
have
a
question
of
procedure.
here
we
have
a
question
of
remedy
and
not
a
question
of
merits.
so
then,
would
it
not
be
proper
to
ask
the
question
insofar
as
this
state
statute
is
concerned?
is
it
reasonable
in
character?
is
five
years
a
reasonable
time?
we
contend
vigorously
that
it
is.
take
for
instance
this
proposition.
i
cited
in
the
motion
to
affirm
the
fact
that
in
florida
from
whence
this
judgment
comes,
florida
limitation
period
on
domestic
judgments
is
20
years.
their
period
of
limitation
on
foreign
judgments
is
seven
years.
now,
even
taken
by
their
own
state,
georgia
from
a
presented
standpoint
is
far
more
magnanimous
in
its
period
of
time
than
florida.
that's
five
as
compared
to
seven.
so,
we
say
this.
we
say
that
our
code
section
of
five
years
is
reasonable.
it
certainly
affords
a
period
of
time,
a
reasonable
period
of
time
in
which
the
appellant
to
bring
such
a
suit.
we
say
this
that
the
appellant
in
his
brief
has
stated,
surely
you
have
the
right
to
pass
such
a
statute
that
has
been
no
question
raised
–
pointed
out
in
my
brother's
brief
wherein
the
statute
of
five
years
is
unreasonable,
no;
that
the
state
of
georgia
has
no
right
to
pass
such
a
statute.
i
might
say
in
closing
that
these
particular
statutes
are
very
common
throughout
the
nation
and
justly
so,
so
that
a
man
may
know
where
his
plea
stands
so
far
as
his
rights
are
concerned
and
his
responsibilities
and
in
these
numbers
of
states
of
the
union
in
which
i
have
cited
wherein
it
is
not
violative
of
the
full
faith
and
credit,
we
say
that
it
is
not
discriminatory
nor
has
the
appellant
pointed
in
any
particular
phase
wherein
it
is
discriminatory
and
we,
therefore,
ask
this
honorable
court
to
declare
this
code
section
constitutional.
mr.
martin
mcfarland
yes,
your
honor
but
under
the
m'elmoyle
case,
i
believe
–
