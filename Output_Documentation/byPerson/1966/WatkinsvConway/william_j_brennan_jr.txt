justice
william
j.
brennan,

may
a
state
do
you
think,
say
you
can't
recover
from
a
foreign
judgment
and
the
state
shall
reduce
it
to
a
foreign
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
may
go
that
far,
why
then
they
(voice
overlap)
can't
fix
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
my
question
--
my
question
was,
you
have
a
florida
judgment.
may
georgia
say,
“that
will
not
be
enforced”.
may
they
say
it
in
face
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
that
judgment
will
not
be
enforced
in
georgia
until
it's
been
reduced
to
a
georgia
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
a
state
may
do
that
in
the
face
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
i
don't
understand
why
they
can't
say,
and
you
must
do
it
within
two
years
or
three
years
or
five
years
at
the
time
that
you
get
a
foreign
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
your
georgia
system
is
this
--
it's
not
the
m'elmoyle
involves
this
very
statute,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
the
statute
will
be
very
old
one;
it
was
here
1839.
do
i
understand
the
way
your
system
works,
if
one
gets
a
georgia
judgment,
if
he
levies
within
seven
years,
then
the
judgment
survives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
fails
within
seven
years
to
levy,
then
he
must
provided
by
what,
an
original
suit
on
the
georgia
judgment
within
the
remaining
three
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
case
of
a
foreign
judgment,
he
has
to
bring
this
action
on
that
judgment
within
five
years
then
he
gets
georgia
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
which
then
i
guess
the
same
things
attaches.
in
seven
years,
he
must
do
it
and
if
he
doesn't
then
within
three
years
he
has
to
start
another
suit,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mcfarland,
do
you
know
whether
the
10-year
statute
was
on
the
books
in
georgia
at
the
time
m'elmoyle
was
decided
in
1839?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
like
the
five-year
old?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
scire
facias,
is
that
an
administrative
proceeding?
it's
not
the
original
action,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
an
adverary
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
is
it
an
adversary
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
kind
of
defense
from
the
defendant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
m'elmoyle
i
notice
from
your
adversary
brief
that
apparently,
this
10-year
statute
was
a
section
in
the
act
of
1823
cab
498,
is
that
be
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
time
m'elmoyle
was
decided
then,
both
the
statutes
were
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
is
presumption
of
payment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
obviously
the
equal
protection
question
could
not
have
been
raised
because
fourteenth
amendment
didn't
come
on
the
books
till
30
years
later?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
metcalf
folded
extensively
from
m'elmoyle
and
metcalf
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1893;
that
was
after
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
certainly,
if
i
read
this
opinion
of
chief
justice
fuller
accurately,
he
seems
think
well
of
what
justice
wayde
in
said
m'elmoyle
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
was
the
federal
judgment
in
georgia
versus
a
georgia
judgment,
that's
really
what
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
