mr.
william
g.
vance
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
to
be
resolved
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
georgia
code
section
3-701.
this
statute
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
statute
of
limitations
against
foreign
judgments,
that
is
out-of-state
judgments,
for
five
years.
in
other
words,
after
five
years
you
no
longer
have
a
right
to
enforce
an
out-of-state
judgment
in
the
state
of
georgia.
at
the
same
time,
under
georgia
law,
a
domestic
judgment
is
enforceable
and
remains
enforceable
for
a
period
of
ten
years.
we
submit
this
discrimination
in
favor
of
domestic
judgments
and
against
out-of-state
judgments
is
unconstitutional
and
violates
both
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
we
do
not
argue
the
georgia
cannot
enact
any
statute
of
limitations
against
the
enforcement
of
foreign
judgments.
we
are
only
arguing
that
it
cannot
enact
a
statute
of
limitations
which
discriminates
in
favor
of
its
own
judgments
and
against
out-of-state
judgments.
this
is
our
sole
argument.
now,
with
respect
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
this
court
has
said
in
milwaukee
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no
sir
the
way
it
works
is
for
seven
years,
the
holder
of
a
georgia
judgment
can
just
sit
on
his
hands
and
he
didn't
levy
on
that
time.
if
he
does
levy,
then
the
judgment
is
renewed
for
another
seven-year
period,
but
assuming
that
he
does
not
do
anything
with
this
judgment
for
seven
years
then
he
has
an
additional
three-year
period
after
that
within
which
to
bring
a
suit
on
that
judgment
to
revive
it.
so,
he
loses
all
his
rights
to
that
judgment
after
10
years.
he
still
has
an
enforceable
right
for
a
period
of
10
years
although
he
loses
his
right
to
levy
after
seven.
mr.
william
g.
vance
he
has
no
right
to
levy.
mr.
william
g.
vance
he
has
to
sue,
but
the
critical
question
is
how
long
can
the
holder
of
a
judgment
sit
on
his
hands
before
he
loses
his
rights.
that's
a
critical
question.
mr.
william
g.
vance
it's
been
on
the
book
since
prior
to
1836,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
sure
when
it
was
enacted,
but
it's
been
on
the
books
for
very
long
time.
with
respect
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clauses,
court
has
said
in
milwaukee
county
case,
the
very
purpose
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
was
to
alter
the
status
of
the
several
states
as
independent
foreign
sovereignties,
each
predate
no
obligations
in
credit
–
created
under
the
laws
by
the
judicial
proceedings
of
the
others
and
to
make
them
integral
parts
of
a
single
nation
through
out
which
a
remedy
upon
a
just
obligation
may
be
demanded
as
right
respective
of
the
state
of
origin.
we
submit
that
if
the
statute
is
in
question
is
allowed
to
be
enforced
in
favor
of
domestic
judgments
then
no
longer
do
we
have
a
central
nation
but
we
have
a
nation
of
individual
sovereignties
with
respect
to
this
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
mr.
william
g.
vance
you
have
to
bring
suit
on
the
foreign
judgment
to
--
in
effect
turn
it
into
a
georgia
judgment.
after
you
serve
the
defendant,
it
turns
it
into
a
georgia
judgment
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
if
you
can
keep
a
judgment
enforced
indefinitely
once
you
have
a
georgia
judgment,
if
you
levy
on
it
within
the
seven-year
period,
you
can
keep
it
enforced
for
indefinite
period
of
time
for
a
thousand
years.
a
foreign
judgment
by
attorney
--
by
bringing
suit
within
the
five-year
period,
you
could
keep
it
enforced
indefinitely.
the
only
question
is:
how
long
do
you
have
before
you
loss
your
rights;
you
loss
your
rights
on
a
foreign
judgment
after
five
years
if
you
do
nothing
at
all.
on
a
georgia
judgment,
if
you
do
nothing
at
all,
you
loss
it
after
ten
years.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
it's
just
a
common-law
action
which
you
file
suit
on
the
florida
judgment
in
this
case.
the
only
issues
that
can
be
raised
are
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
any
defense
that
would
have
been
good
to
florida
to
that
judgment,
they
would
all
return
that
judgment
after
there
had
been
a
judgment.
those
are
the
only
issues
that
could
be
raised
at
that
time.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no,
sir.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
at
all.
we
submit
that
you
have
it
–
the
same
thing
you
have
a
foreign
--
you
have
a
judgment,
one
of
them
is
foreign
and
one
of
this
domestic,
we
submit
that
it
is
rational
for
georgia
to
require
more
astringent
procedural
requirements
with
relation
to
the
enforcement
of
the
foreign
judgment
because
it's
not
on
record
in
georgia;
there
has
to
be
some
way
of
proving
it's
in
georgia.
and
so,
it's
rationale
for
them
to
require
these
additional
requirements
in
effect
requiring
us
to
file
suit
on
the
judgment,
but
just
because
they
can
distinguish
in
this
manner,
it
doesn't
mean
they
can
go
further
and
effect
more
severe
limitations
as
to
time
against
us.
that's
our
contention.
mr.
william
g.
vance
there
are
quite
a
few
states
who'd
have
this
type
of
set
up
where
they
allow
different
period
of
limitation,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir,
very
common,
very
common.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no,
sir.
i
have
not
compiled
it
on
the
reason
that
i'm
aware
because
there's
a
quite
a
few
state
supreme
court
judgments
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
but
in
none
of
these
was
a
question
of
discrimination
presented.
all
these
cases
just
can
any
statute
of
limitations
be
applied
and
none
of
them
brought
up
the
question
of
whether
discriminatory
provision
as
in
this
case.
but
they
are
discriminatory
since
nobody
have
ever
brought
one
of
them
before
as
i
can
determine.
we
submit
that
the
cases
of
hughes
v.
fetter
and
wells
v.
simonds
abrasive
decided
in
1951
and
1953
read
together,
in
fact
demand
a
finding
in
this
case
that
full
faith
and
credit
has
been
violated.
in
hughes,
the
plaintiff
brought
suit
in
wisconsin
on
a
wrongful
death
action
for
an
injury
or
death
occurring
in
illinois.
the
wisconsin
courts
construed
that
wrongful
death
statute
as
applying
only
to
death
occurring
in
wisconsin
and
also
creating
a
policy
against
the
enforcement
of
out-of-state
wrongful
death
acts.
they
therefore
refused
to
enforce
the
illinois
wrongful
death
act
although
all
the
parties
were
wisconsin
residents
involved.
this
court
reversed
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
stated
that
full
faith
and
credit
required
wisconsin
to
enforce
the
illinois
wrongful
death
action.
they
found
that
there
was
no
strong
policy
against
wrongful
death
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
they
allowed
an
action
in
wisconsin
and
for
that
reason,
they
required
them
to
enforce
the
wrongful
death
act
to
the
illinois.
now,
the
reasoning
of
hughes
weren't
too
clear,
at
least
to
me,
until
the
wells
case
was
decided
subsequently.
in
that
case,
you
had
a
situation
where
alabama
plaintiff
was
bringing
a
wrongful
death
action
in
pennsylvania
approximately
one
and
a
half
years
after
the
death
of
the
decedent.
pennsylvania
had
one
year
statute
of
limitations
whereas
the
alabama
wrongful
death
statute
where
the
accident
occurred
out
a
two-year
proviso
in
there.
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
the
–
under
hughes,
the
two-year
proviso
must
go
with
the
statute
and
must
be
enforced
in
pennsylvania.
this
court
refused
to
follow
hughes
to
that
extent
because
of
the
fact
they
stated
that
pennsylvania
applied
her
one-year
statute
of
limitations
both
to
domestic
causes
of
action
and
to
foreign
causes
of
action.
i'd
like
to
read
to
you
this
language
from
wells
because,
i
think,
it's
most
significant
language
with
respect
to
this
case.
the
court
says
here,
“a
decision
in
hughes
v.
fetter
does
not
call
for
a
change
in
the
well-established
rule
that
the
forum
state
is
permitted
to
apply
its
own
period
of
limitation”.
the
crucial
factor
in
that
case
was
that
the
foreign
laid
an
uneven
hand
on
causes
of
action
arising
within
and
without
the
forum
state.
causes
of
action
arising
in
sister
states
were
discriminated
against.
here,
pennsylvania
applies
a
one-year
limitation
to
all
wrongful
death
actions
wherever
they
may
arise.
in
other
words,
if
pennsylvania
had
a
one-year
limitation
for
out-of-state
causes
of
action
and
a
two-year
limitation
for
its
own,
then
clearly,
in
wells
by
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
apply
that
statute
of
limitations,
but
here,
they
applied
a
one-year
statute
to
all
causes
of
action.
we
submit
that
georgia
has
discriminated
as
was
contemplated
in
wells.
they
have
applied
a
five-year
statute
against
foreign
judgment
on
a
ten-year
statute
against
their
own.
now,
hughes
and
wells
both
dealt
that
with
ordinary
causes
of
action
and
i
don't
think
it's
questioned
that
the
enforcement
of
full
faith
and
credit
clause
has
been
much
more
stringent
with
respect
to
judgments
rather
than
causes
of
action.
it's
been
much
more
astringent
provisions
and
cases
were
much
stronger
with
respect
to
judgments
and
a
rightly
so.
so,
for
this
reason,
if
this
rule
applied
in
hughes
and
wells
to
ordinary
causes
of
action,
it
certainly
would
apply
to
judgments
because
judgments
are
given
so
much
greater
protection
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
very
same
statute
has
been
before
this
court
in
1836
in
m'elmoyle
v.
cohen.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
statute
did
not
violate
full
faith
and
credit
but
in
that
case,
the
question
of
discrimination
was
not
presented
to
the
court.
now,
all
that
was
held
in
that
case,
we
submit
that
was
that
a
reasonable
statute
of
limitations
can
be
applied
to
the
foreign
judgment.
this
case
went
off
on
the
procedural
--
the
fact
that
the
court
said
the
procedural
limitations
could
be
placed
on
the
enforcement
of
judgments
whereas
the
merits
of
a
judgment
could
not
be
attacked.
later
cases
have
subsequently
restricted
this
procedural
rule
to
affect
to
able
to
say
that
only
procedural
limitations
can
only
be
placed
on
the
enforcement
of
foreign
judgments
if
they
do
not
discriminate,
i
think,
the
fact
that
this
procedural
rule
has
been
so
limited
as
brought
out
by
the
kenney
case
where
a
statute
of
limit
--
there
was
a
statute
construed
as
depriving
the
forum
state
of
jurisdiction
of
a
right
to
enforce
the
judgment
from
another
state
with
respect
to
a
wrongful
death
action.
the
supreme
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
forum
state
could
not
get
around
its
constitutional
obligation
by
a
mere
device
of
withdrawing
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
hughes
case,
it
was
once
again
announced
that
this
device
could
not
be
used.
in
hughes,
it
was
stated,
it's
well
settled,
that
this
wisconsin
cannot
escape
its
constitutional
obligations
by
the
simple
device
of
removing
jurisdiction
from
courts
otherwise,
competence
by
court.
hughes,
of
course
meant
that
what
courts
otherwise
dealt
with
this
type
of
cause
of
action,
they
would
have
to
deal
with
it,
with
respect
to
out-of-state
causes
of
action
as
well
as
in-state
causes
of
action.
in
the
wells
case,
m'elmoyle
was
cited.
it
was
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
may
apply
its
own
statute
of
limitations.
but
wells,
of
course,
went
on
to
say
that
states
may
not
discriminate
with
respect
to
statute
of
limitations.
so
that
affectively
limited
m'elmoyle
in
that
case.
mr.
william
g.
vance
oh!
no,
sir,
i
would
not
question
that
at
all.
i
don't
have
any
complaint
with
that
and
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
i
think
on
the
hughes
and
wells,
we
certainly
have
full
faith
and
credit
justification
for
following,
but
we
certainly
think
that
equal
protection
applies
just
as
well.
we
think
both
of
these
doctrines
would
apply.
but
if
you
find
that
equal
protection
as
in
viewed
in
full
faith
and
credit
apply
now.
but
i
think,
full
faith
and
credit
has
definite
equal
protection
concepts
at
least
under
the
hughes
and
the
wells
case.
if
you
read
those
two
cases,
it's
been
in
full
faith
and
credit
clauses
which
they
were
expressly
decided.
we
do,
however,
have
definite
equal
protection
argument
and
we
think
that
both
--
that's
really
the
same
argument
as
far
as
the
discrimination
point
but
we
think
both
clauses
apply,
that's
basically
--
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
believe
that
there
has
been
a
purposeful
and
systematic
discrimination
in
this
case
against
the
foreign
judgments
and
in
favor
of
domestic
judgments.
to
justify
this
classification,
there
must
be
some
--
the
class
discriminated
against
must
be
the
subject
of
a
classification
based
upon
reasonable
differences
between
the
favored
and
the
disfavored
classes.
the
only
difference
here
is
we
have
a
foreign
judgment
rather
than
a
domestic
judgment.
now,
there
are
certain
times
that
you
can
discriminate
because
something
is
foreign
rather
than
domestic.
for
instance,
the
filing
of
court
costs,
many
times
a
foreign
plaintiff
is
required
to
file
additional
court
costs
because
he
is
a
foreign
plaintiff.
now
this
has
a
rationale
reason
or
rationale
reason
can
be
assigned
for
it
in
that
if
he
ultimately
has
to
pay
the
court
costs
they
don't
have
to
go
out
the
jurisdiction
to
collect
them
which
would
be
extremely
difficult.
here,
there's
no
rationale
reason
for
applying
a
longer
period
against
foreign
judgment
over
or
requiring
shorter
period
against
foreign
judgments
than
domestic
judgments.
no
reason
can
be
assigned.
we
think
that
the
cases
clearly
show,
a
few
cases
on
this
point
that
discrimination
based
merely
on
the
fact
that
something
occurs
on
it
or
is
related
to
an
out-of-state
as
opposed
an
in-state
where
there's
no
rational
reason
for
this
discrimination
is
invalid
or
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
yes,
sir
that
that
would
be
a
question
whether
there
is
a
reason
and
we
can
find
no
reason.
mr.
william
g.
vance
as
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
there's
a
five-year
statute
limitations
against
out-of-state
judgments.
now
with
domestic
judgments,
the
rule
is
that
once
you
acquire
the
judgment
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
right.
that
applies
to
all
georgia
domestic
judgments.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
i
contend
that
it
would
but
the
reason
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
the
reason,
i
think,
that
it
would
be
irrational
would
be
because
of
the
fact
–
i
think
you
would
have
to
interrelate
with
full
faith
and
credit
clause
with
the
equal
protection
clause
with
respect
to
that
question,
but
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
provides
for
what
is
an
adequate
record
in
the
act
of
congress
under
the
full
faith
credit
clause.
and,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
they
could
say,
for
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
that
this
was
not
an
adequate
record
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
for
use
this
as
a
basis
for
distinction
under
the
equal
protection.
that
would
be
my
answer
to
that.
i
just
don't
think
that
they
could
use
that
as
a
basis
for
distinction
when
you
have
complied
with
the
requirements
listed
by
congress
under
the
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
i
think
the
reason
as
far
as
the
rose
it's
pretty
well
revealed
by
the
m'elmoyle
case
is
that
first,
they
didn't
have
any
statute
of
limitations
against
foreign
judgments
and
of
course
domestic
judgments
lapsed
after
20
years
with
the
presumption
of
payment.
then
they
decided
they
had
to
something
about
foreign
judgment
so
they
enacted
a
separate
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
them.
it
didn't
necessarily
relate
to
two
and,
of
course,
this
was
before
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
was
even
inexistent
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
the
concepts
of
equal
protection
weren't
really
enunciated
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
these
statutes.
there's
just
one
case
under
the
equal
protection
clause
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
and
that's
the
power
manufacturing
case
and
in
that
case,
a
suit
was
brought
against
a
foreign
corporation
which
had
one
office
in
arkansas,
but
suit
was
brought
in
another
county
other
than
the
office
of
the
county
in
which
it
had
its
one
office.
now,
under
the
arkansas
venue
statutes,
foreign
corporations
could
be
sued
in
any
county
whereas
domestic
corporations
could
only
be
sued
on
the
counties
in
which
they
did
business.
the
defendant
in
that
case
objected
to
that
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
equal
protection.
this
court
held
that
the
statute
did
violate
the
equal
protection
because
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
corporation
in
that
situation.
the
reason
behind
the
statue
was
obvious.
it
was
just
to
sue
in
the
county
of
the
residents,
was
just
to
allow
--
was
purposes
of
considerations
or
convenience
and
economy.
there
was
no
reason
bear
for
distinguishing
between
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
corporation.
and
we
submit
that
there's
no
real
reason
here
for
distinguishing
between
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
corporation.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no,
sir.
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
light
of
the
problem
and
the
domestic
enforcement
statutes.
now
we
feel
like
we
would
be
banned
by
m'elmoyle
which
is
a
1936
case
if
that
was
the
case
and
we
don't
feel
that
has
been
overruled
by
later
decisions
or
any
implication
that
it
would
be
overruled.
mr.
william
g.
vance
sir?
mr.
william
g.
vance
i
think
its
pertinent
because
it
deals
the
same
statute
but
we
don't
believe
the
same
question
was
brought
up
in
m'elmoyle
that
would
bring
it
up
here.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
it's
based
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
submit
that
m'elmoyle
did
not
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
it
really
dealt
with
the
issue
of
discrimination
although
it
recognize--
mr.
william
g.
vance
your
honor,
i
realize
that
language
is
in
there
but
i
believe
they
will
face
with
the
question
of
whether
any
statute
of
limitations
could
be
enforced
against
foreign
judgments.
now,
in
order
to
answer
this
question,
yes,
they
said:
“well,
the
states
can
put
a
limitation
on
their
own
judgments”.
mr.
william
g.
vance
syes,
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
william
g.
vance
the
state
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
state
can
put
procedural
limitations
on
the
enforcement
of
foreign
judgments
as
long
as
they
do
not
discriminate.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir
because
i
don't
believe
these
affects
the
substance
of
the
right.
it's
just
like
the
area
rule
of
dealing
with
statute
of
limitations.
that
really
was
a
substantive
measure.
they
are
just
requiring
a
little
bit
more
astringent
procedure.
they
are
really
not
denied
any
of
their
rights.
they
just
have
to
go
through
a
little
bit
longer
procedure
but
they
still
(voice
overlap)
have
not
lost
any
right.
mr.
william
g.
vance
it's
my
feeling
your
honor
that
in
one
case
you
are
denying
substantive
rights
because
five
versus
ten
and
in
the
other
you
are
saying
that
you
have
to
go
through
a
little
bit
different
procedure
and
it
may
be
a
little
bit
more
difficult
but
you
can
do
that.
it's
not
--
this
is
not
something
that
is
impossible
for
you
to
do.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct,
sir,
just
like
the
suit
on
the
foreign
judgment
at
that
point.
it
would
be
the
same
type
of
suit.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
as
i
pointed
out,
you
can
keep
alive
the
judgment
indefinitely
by
taking
certain
action.
may
be
one
of
them,
can
or,
your
honor,
be
able
to
keep
alive
indefinitely.
the
only
question
is
this,
how
long
can
you
sit
on
your
hands
before
you
loss
our
rights
to
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
and
that's
basically
the
question.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
that'
correct.
if
you
only
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
if
you
only
look
at
that
period,
but
the
question
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
is
because
the
foreign
judgment
is
not
of
record
in
the
state
of
georgia.
there
has
to
be
some
method
of
making
it
up
in
the
record
of
georgia.
now
with
federal
judgments,
they
will
just
allow
you
to
file
it
on
the
record,
but
with
out-of-state
judgments,
you
have
to
come
in
and
file
suit.
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
to
require
the
out
of
state
judgments
to
do
this.
it
doesn't
really
deny
the
substantive
right
whereas
if
i
wait
to
seven
years,
i've
lost
my
substantive
right
to
enforce
that
judgment
with
--
after
four
years,
i
can
still
enforce
my
out-of-state
judgment
even
though
i
have
to
go
a
little
bit
more
stringent
procedure
to
do
it,
if
it
is
an
out-of-state
judgment.
now,
on
domestic
judgment,
i
had
really
lost
anything
substantive
wheras
i
have
with
foregin
judgments
under
the
statute
of
limitations
discriminations.
mr.
william
g.
vance
i'd
like
to
first
point
out,
your
honors,
that
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
appellee
in
his
brief
and
in
the
argument
do
not
involve
cases
where
any
discrimination
was
alleged.
all
they
hold
is
that
a
statute
of
limitation
may
be
enacted
against
foreign
judgments.
we
do
not
question
that
proposition.
we
have
no
argument
to
that
proposition.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
i
think
there
might
have
been
a
little
confusion
only
as
to
that
--
while
this
is
an
equal
protection
case,
it
is
also
full
faith
and
credit
case
and
we
think
we
have
a
very
good
full
faith
and
credit
case
here.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
it's
even
worse
than
that
as
far
as
it
goes.
i
think
in
m'elmoyle,
they
said
that
there
was
a
20-year
presumption
against
domestic
judgments
at
that
time.
so
it
was
20
instead
of
ten
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
that's
what
they
discussed
in
this.
so
it
did
exist
in
the
m'elmoyle
but
i
don't
just
believe
that
was
an
issue
there.
it
was
not
raised.
if
you
look
at
the
argument
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
even
though
this
was
recognized,
if
you
look
at
the
argument
of
counsel
in
the
--
prior
to
the
opinion
it's
clear
that
this
point
was
not
argued
and
that
really
was
not
considered
in
that
context
by
the
court
as
being
an
argument
to
vitiate
the
statute.
if
you
read
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
metcalf
opinion,
you
will
note
that
that
was
dealing
with
federal
judgments
(voice
overlap)
out-of-state
judgment
and
the
court
felt
constrained
to
overrule
a
prior
wisconsin
supreme
court
case
interpreting
its
own
statute
so
there
would
be
no
discrimination
between
the
period
of
time
for
federal
judgment
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
as
federal
versus
domestic
in
that
case
and
the
supremacy
clause
was
involved
rather
than
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
but
i
think
the
same
considerations
of
policy
were
involved.
and
there,
the
court
went
on
to
overrule
a
wisconsin
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
in
order
not
to
rule
the
period
of
limitation
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
professor
carrie,
who
is
probably
the
expert
on
full
faith
and
credit
probably
the
most
renown
authority
has
felt
that
hughes
v.
fetter
and
wells
v.
simonds
abrasive
were
really
equal
protection
cases
and
should
have
been
decided
on
the
equal
protection
clause
rather
than
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
of
course,
equal
protection
was
not
raised
in
those
two
cases
so
it
was
not
discussed
by
the
case.
but
he
felt
that
this
case
was
proper
rather
than
full
faith
and
credit
cases
and
should
--
by
the
same
token
if
the
same
reasoning
applies
with
respect
to
that
statute.
mr.
william
g.
vance
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
to
be
resolved
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
georgia
code
section
3-701.
this
statute
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
statute
of
limitations
against
foreign
judgments,
that
is
out-of-state
judgments,
for
five
years.
in
other
words,
after
five
years
you
no
longer
have
a
right
to
enforce
an
out-of-state
judgment
in
the
state
of
georgia.
at
the
same
time,
under
georgia
law,
a
domestic
judgment
is
enforceable
and
remains
enforceable
for
a
period
of
ten
years.
we
submit
this
discrimination
in
favor
of
domestic
judgments
and
against
out-of-state
judgments
is
unconstitutional
and
violates
both
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
we
do
not
argue
the
georgia
cannot
enact
any
statute
of
limitations
against
the
enforcement
of
foreign
judgments.
we
are
only
arguing
that
it
cannot
enact
a
statute
of
limitations
which
discriminates
in
favor
of
its
own
judgments
and
against
out-of-state
judgments.
this
is
our
sole
argument.
now,
with
respect
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
this
court
has
said
in
milwaukee
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no
sir
the
way
it
works
is
for
seven
years,
the
holder
of
a
georgia
judgment
can
just
sit
on
his
hands
and
he
didn't
levy
on
that
time.
if
he
does
levy,
then
the
judgment
is
renewed
for
another
seven-year
period,
but
assuming
that
he
does
not
do
anything
with
this
judgment
for
seven
years
then
he
has
an
additional
three-year
period
after
that
within
which
to
bring
a
suit
on
that
judgment
to
revive
it.
so,
he
loses
all
his
rights
to
that
judgment
after
10
years.
he
still
has
an
enforceable
right
for
a
period
of
10
years
although
he
loses
his
right
to
levy
after
seven.
mr.
william
g.
vance
he
has
no
right
to
levy.
mr.
william
g.
vance
he
has
to
sue,
but
the
critical
question
is
how
long
can
the
holder
of
a
judgment
sit
on
his
hands
before
he
loses
his
rights.
that's
a
critical
question.
mr.
william
g.
vance
it's
been
on
the
book
since
prior
to
1836,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
sure
when
it
was
enacted,
but
it's
been
on
the
books
for
very
long
time.
with
respect
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clauses,
court
has
said
in
milwaukee
county
case,
the
very
purpose
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
was
to
alter
the
status
of
the
several
states
as
independent
foreign
sovereignties,
each
predate
no
obligations
in
credit
–
created
under
the
laws
by
the
judicial
proceedings
of
the
others
and
to
make
them
integral
parts
of
a
single
nation
through
out
which
a
remedy
upon
a
just
obligation
may
be
demanded
as
right
respective
of
the
state
of
origin.
we
submit
that
if
the
statute
is
in
question
is
allowed
to
be
enforced
in
favor
of
domestic
judgments
then
no
longer
do
we
have
a
central
nation
but
we
have
a
nation
of
individual
sovereignties
with
respect
to
this
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
mr.
william
g.
vance
you
have
to
bring
suit
on
the
foreign
judgment
to
--
in
effect
turn
it
into
a
georgia
judgment.
after
you
serve
the
defendant,
it
turns
it
into
a
georgia
judgment
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
if
you
can
keep
a
judgment
enforced
indefinitely
once
you
have
a
georgia
judgment,
if
you
levy
on
it
within
the
seven-year
period,
you
can
keep
it
enforced
for
indefinite
period
of
time
for
a
thousand
years.
a
foreign
judgment
by
attorney
--
by
bringing
suit
within
the
five-year
period,
you
could
keep
it
enforced
indefinitely.
the
only
question
is:
how
long
do
you
have
before
you
loss
your
rights;
you
loss
your
rights
on
a
foreign
judgment
after
five
years
if
you
do
nothing
at
all.
on
a
georgia
judgment,
if
you
do
nothing
at
all,
you
loss
it
after
ten
years.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
it's
just
a
common-law
action
which
you
file
suit
on
the
florida
judgment
in
this
case.
the
only
issues
that
can
be
raised
are
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
any
defense
that
would
have
been
good
to
florida
to
that
judgment,
they
would
all
return
that
judgment
after
there
had
been
a
judgment.
those
are
the
only
issues
that
could
be
raised
at
that
time.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no,
sir.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
at
all.
we
submit
that
you
have
it
–
the
same
thing
you
have
a
foreign
--
you
have
a
judgment,
one
of
them
is
foreign
and
one
of
this
domestic,
we
submit
that
it
is
rational
for
georgia
to
require
more
astringent
procedural
requirements
with
relation
to
the
enforcement
of
the
foreign
judgment
because
it's
not
on
record
in
georgia;
there
has
to
be
some
way
of
proving
it's
in
georgia.
and
so,
it's
rationale
for
them
to
require
these
additional
requirements
in
effect
requiring
us
to
file
suit
on
the
judgment,
but
just
because
they
can
distinguish
in
this
manner,
it
doesn't
mean
they
can
go
further
and
effect
more
severe
limitations
as
to
time
against
us.
that's
our
contention.
mr.
william
g.
vance
there
are
quite
a
few
states
who'd
have
this
type
of
set
up
where
they
allow
different
period
of
limitation,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir,
very
common,
very
common.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no,
sir.
i
have
not
compiled
it
on
the
reason
that
i'm
aware
because
there's
a
quite
a
few
state
supreme
court
judgments
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
but
in
none
of
these
was
a
question
of
discrimination
presented.
all
these
cases
just
can
any
statute
of
limitations
be
applied
and
none
of
them
brought
up
the
question
of
whether
discriminatory
provision
as
in
this
case.
but
they
are
discriminatory
since
nobody
have
ever
brought
one
of
them
before
as
i
can
determine.
we
submit
that
the
cases
of
hughes
v.
fetter
and
wells
v.
simonds
abrasive
decided
in
1951
and
1953
read
together,
in
fact
demand
a
finding
in
this
case
that
full
faith
and
credit
has
been
violated.
in
hughes,
the
plaintiff
brought
suit
in
wisconsin
on
a
wrongful
death
action
for
an
injury
or
death
occurring
in
illinois.
the
wisconsin
courts
construed
that
wrongful
death
statute
as
applying
only
to
death
occurring
in
wisconsin
and
also
creating
a
policy
against
the
enforcement
of
out-of-state
wrongful
death
acts.
they
therefore
refused
to
enforce
the
illinois
wrongful
death
act
although
all
the
parties
were
wisconsin
residents
involved.
this
court
reversed
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
stated
that
full
faith
and
credit
required
wisconsin
to
enforce
the
illinois
wrongful
death
action.
they
found
that
there
was
no
strong
policy
against
wrongful
death
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
they
allowed
an
action
in
wisconsin
and
for
that
reason,
they
required
them
to
enforce
the
wrongful
death
act
to
the
illinois.
now,
the
reasoning
of
hughes
weren't
too
clear,
at
least
to
me,
until
the
wells
case
was
decided
subsequently.
in
that
case,
you
had
a
situation
where
alabama
plaintiff
was
bringing
a
wrongful
death
action
in
pennsylvania
approximately
one
and
a
half
years
after
the
death
of
the
decedent.
pennsylvania
had
one
year
statute
of
limitations
whereas
the
alabama
wrongful
death
statute
where
the
accident
occurred
out
a
two-year
proviso
in
there.
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
the
–
under
hughes,
the
two-year
proviso
must
go
with
the
statute
and
must
be
enforced
in
pennsylvania.
this
court
refused
to
follow
hughes
to
that
extent
because
of
the
fact
they
stated
that
pennsylvania
applied
her
one-year
statute
of
limitations
both
to
domestic
causes
of
action
and
to
foreign
causes
of
action.
i'd
like
to
read
to
you
this
language
from
wells
because,
i
think,
it's
most
significant
language
with
respect
to
this
case.
the
court
says
here,
“a
decision
in
hughes
v.
fetter
does
not
call
for
a
change
in
the
well-established
rule
that
the
forum
state
is
permitted
to
apply
its
own
period
of
limitation”.
the
crucial
factor
in
that
case
was
that
the
foreign
laid
an
uneven
hand
on
causes
of
action
arising
within
and
without
the
forum
state.
causes
of
action
arising
in
sister
states
were
discriminated
against.
here,
pennsylvania
applies
a
one-year
limitation
to
all
wrongful
death
actions
wherever
they
may
arise.
in
other
words,
if
pennsylvania
had
a
one-year
limitation
for
out-of-state
causes
of
action
and
a
two-year
limitation
for
its
own,
then
clearly,
in
wells
by
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
apply
that
statute
of
limitations,
but
here,
they
applied
a
one-year
statute
to
all
causes
of
action.
we
submit
that
georgia
has
discriminated
as
was
contemplated
in
wells.
they
have
applied
a
five-year
statute
against
foreign
judgment
on
a
ten-year
statute
against
their
own.
now,
hughes
and
wells
both
dealt
that
with
ordinary
causes
of
action
and
i
don't
think
it's
questioned
that
the
enforcement
of
full
faith
and
credit
clause
has
been
much
more
stringent
with
respect
to
judgments
rather
than
causes
of
action.
it's
been
much
more
astringent
provisions
and
cases
were
much
stronger
with
respect
to
judgments
and
a
rightly
so.
so,
for
this
reason,
if
this
rule
applied
in
hughes
and
wells
to
ordinary
causes
of
action,
it
certainly
would
apply
to
judgments
because
judgments
are
given
so
much
greater
protection
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
very
same
statute
has
been
before
this
court
in
1836
in
m'elmoyle
v.
cohen.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
statute
did
not
violate
full
faith
and
credit
but
in
that
case,
the
question
of
discrimination
was
not
presented
to
the
court.
now,
all
that
was
held
in
that
case,
we
submit
that
was
that
a
reasonable
statute
of
limitations
can
be
applied
to
the
foreign
judgment.
this
case
went
off
on
the
procedural
--
the
fact
that
the
court
said
the
procedural
limitations
could
be
placed
on
the
enforcement
of
judgments
whereas
the
merits
of
a
judgment
could
not
be
attacked.
later
cases
have
subsequently
restricted
this
procedural
rule
to
affect
to
able
to
say
that
only
procedural
limitations
can
only
be
placed
on
the
enforcement
of
foreign
judgments
if
they
do
not
discriminate,
i
think,
the
fact
that
this
procedural
rule
has
been
so
limited
as
brought
out
by
the
kenney
case
where
a
statute
of
limit
--
there
was
a
statute
construed
as
depriving
the
forum
state
of
jurisdiction
of
a
right
to
enforce
the
judgment
from
another
state
with
respect
to
a
wrongful
death
action.
the
supreme
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
forum
state
could
not
get
around
its
constitutional
obligation
by
a
mere
device
of
withdrawing
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
hughes
case,
it
was
once
again
announced
that
this
device
could
not
be
used.
in
hughes,
it
was
stated,
it's
well
settled,
that
this
wisconsin
cannot
escape
its
constitutional
obligations
by
the
simple
device
of
removing
jurisdiction
from
courts
otherwise,
competence
by
court.
hughes,
of
course
meant
that
what
courts
otherwise
dealt
with
this
type
of
cause
of
action,
they
would
have
to
deal
with
it,
with
respect
to
out-of-state
causes
of
action
as
well
as
in-state
causes
of
action.
in
the
wells
case,
m'elmoyle
was
cited.
it
was
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
may
apply
its
own
statute
of
limitations.
but
wells,
of
course,
went
on
to
say
that
states
may
not
discriminate
with
respect
to
statute
of
limitations.
so
that
affectively
limited
m'elmoyle
in
that
case.
mr.
william
g.
vance
oh!
no,
sir,
i
would
not
question
that
at
all.
i
don't
have
any
complaint
with
that
and
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
i
think
on
the
hughes
and
wells,
we
certainly
have
full
faith
and
credit
justification
for
following,
but
we
certainly
think
that
equal
protection
applies
just
as
well.
we
think
both
of
these
doctrines
would
apply.
but
if
you
find
that
equal
protection
as
in
viewed
in
full
faith
and
credit
apply
now.
but
i
think,
full
faith
and
credit
has
definite
equal
protection
concepts
at
least
under
the
hughes
and
the
wells
case.
if
you
read
those
two
cases,
it's
been
in
full
faith
and
credit
clauses
which
they
were
expressly
decided.
we
do,
however,
have
definite
equal
protection
argument
and
we
think
that
both
--
that's
really
the
same
argument
as
far
as
the
discrimination
point
but
we
think
both
clauses
apply,
that's
basically
--
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
believe
that
there
has
been
a
purposeful
and
systematic
discrimination
in
this
case
against
the
foreign
judgments
and
in
favor
of
domestic
judgments.
to
justify
this
classification,
there
must
be
some
--
the
class
discriminated
against
must
be
the
subject
of
a
classification
based
upon
reasonable
differences
between
the
favored
and
the
disfavored
classes.
the
only
difference
here
is
we
have
a
foreign
judgment
rather
than
a
domestic
judgment.
now,
there
are
certain
times
that
you
can
discriminate
because
something
is
foreign
rather
than
domestic.
for
instance,
the
filing
of
court
costs,
many
times
a
foreign
plaintiff
is
required
to
file
additional
court
costs
because
he
is
a
foreign
plaintiff.
now
this
has
a
rationale
reason
or
rationale
reason
can
be
assigned
for
it
in
that
if
he
ultimately
has
to
pay
the
court
costs
they
don't
have
to
go
out
the
jurisdiction
to
collect
them
which
would
be
extremely
difficult.
here,
there's
no
rationale
reason
for
applying
a
longer
period
against
foreign
judgment
over
or
requiring
shorter
period
against
foreign
judgments
than
domestic
judgments.
no
reason
can
be
assigned.
we
think
that
the
cases
clearly
show,
a
few
cases
on
this
point
that
discrimination
based
merely
on
the
fact
that
something
occurs
on
it
or
is
related
to
an
out-of-state
as
opposed
an
in-state
where
there's
no
rational
reason
for
this
discrimination
is
invalid
or
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
yes,
sir
that
that
would
be
a
question
whether
there
is
a
reason
and
we
can
find
no
reason.
mr.
william
g.
vance
as
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
there's
a
five-year
statute
limitations
against
out-of-state
judgments.
now
with
domestic
judgments,
the
rule
is
that
once
you
acquire
the
judgment
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
right.
that
applies
to
all
georgia
domestic
judgments.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
i
contend
that
it
would
but
the
reason
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
the
reason,
i
think,
that
it
would
be
irrational
would
be
because
of
the
fact
–
i
think
you
would
have
to
interrelate
with
full
faith
and
credit
clause
with
the
equal
protection
clause
with
respect
to
that
question,
but
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
provides
for
what
is
an
adequate
record
in
the
act
of
congress
under
the
full
faith
credit
clause.
and,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
they
could
say,
for
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
that
this
was
not
an
adequate
record
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
for
use
this
as
a
basis
for
distinction
under
the
equal
protection.
that
would
be
my
answer
to
that.
i
just
don't
think
that
they
could
use
that
as
a
basis
for
distinction
when
you
have
complied
with
the
requirements
listed
by
congress
under
the
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
i
think
the
reason
as
far
as
the
rose
it's
pretty
well
revealed
by
the
m'elmoyle
case
is
that
first,
they
didn't
have
any
statute
of
limitations
against
foreign
judgments
and
of
course
domestic
judgments
lapsed
after
20
years
with
the
presumption
of
payment.
then
they
decided
they
had
to
something
about
foreign
judgment
so
they
enacted
a
separate
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
them.
it
didn't
necessarily
relate
to
two
and,
of
course,
this
was
before
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
was
even
inexistent
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
the
concepts
of
equal
protection
weren't
really
enunciated
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
these
statutes.
there's
just
one
case
under
the
equal
protection
clause
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
and
that's
the
power
manufacturing
case
and
in
that
case,
a
suit
was
brought
against
a
foreign
corporation
which
had
one
office
in
arkansas,
but
suit
was
brought
in
another
county
other
than
the
office
of
the
county
in
which
it
had
its
one
office.
now,
under
the
arkansas
venue
statutes,
foreign
corporations
could
be
sued
in
any
county
whereas
domestic
corporations
could
only
be
sued
on
the
counties
in
which
they
did
business.
the
defendant
in
that
case
objected
to
that
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
equal
protection.
this
court
held
that
the
statute
did
violate
the
equal
protection
because
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
corporation
in
that
situation.
the
reason
behind
the
statue
was
obvious.
it
was
just
to
sue
in
the
county
of
the
residents,
was
just
to
allow
--
was
purposes
of
considerations
or
convenience
and
economy.
there
was
no
reason
bear
for
distinguishing
between
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
corporation.
and
we
submit
that
there's
no
real
reason
here
for
distinguishing
between
the
foreign
and
the
domestic
corporation.
mr.
william
g.
vance
no,
sir.
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
light
of
the
problem
and
the
domestic
enforcement
statutes.
now
we
feel
like
we
would
be
banned
by
m'elmoyle
which
is
a
1936
case
if
that
was
the
case
and
we
don't
feel
that
has
been
overruled
by
later
decisions
or
any
implication
that
it
would
be
overruled.
mr.
william
g.
vance
sir?
mr.
william
g.
vance
i
think
its
pertinent
because
it
deals
the
same
statute
but
we
don't
believe
the
same
question
was
brought
up
in
m'elmoyle
that
would
bring
it
up
here.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
it's
based
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
submit
that
m'elmoyle
did
not
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
it
really
dealt
with
the
issue
of
discrimination
although
it
recognize--
mr.
william
g.
vance
your
honor,
i
realize
that
language
is
in
there
but
i
believe
they
will
face
with
the
question
of
whether
any
statute
of
limitations
could
be
enforced
against
foreign
judgments.
now,
in
order
to
answer
this
question,
yes,
they
said:
“well,
the
states
can
put
a
limitation
on
their
own
judgments”.
mr.
william
g.
vance
syes,
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
william
g.
vance
the
state
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
state
can
put
procedural
limitations
on
the
enforcement
of
foreign
judgments
as
long
as
they
do
not
discriminate.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir
because
i
don't
believe
these
affects
the
substance
of
the
right.
it's
just
like
the
area
rule
of
dealing
with
statute
of
limitations.
that
really
was
a
substantive
measure.
they
are
just
requiring
a
little
bit
more
astringent
procedure.
they
are
really
not
denied
any
of
their
rights.
they
just
have
to
go
through
a
little
bit
longer
procedure
but
they
still
(voice
overlap)
have
not
lost
any
right.
mr.
william
g.
vance
it's
my
feeling
your
honor
that
in
one
case
you
are
denying
substantive
rights
because
five
versus
ten
and
in
the
other
you
are
saying
that
you
have
to
go
through
a
little
bit
different
procedure
and
it
may
be
a
little
bit
more
difficult
but
you
can
do
that.
it's
not
--
this
is
not
something
that
is
impossible
for
you
to
do.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct,
sir,
just
like
the
suit
on
the
foreign
judgment
at
that
point.
it
would
be
the
same
type
of
suit.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
as
i
pointed
out,
you
can
keep
alive
the
judgment
indefinitely
by
taking
certain
action.
may
be
one
of
them,
can
or,
your
honor,
be
able
to
keep
alive
indefinitely.
the
only
question
is
this,
how
long
can
you
sit
on
your
hands
before
you
loss
our
rights
to
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
and
that's
basically
the
question.
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
that'
correct.
if
you
only
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
if
you
only
look
at
that
period,
but
the
question
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
is
because
the
foreign
judgment
is
not
of
record
in
the
state
of
georgia.
there
has
to
be
some
method
of
making
it
up
in
the
record
of
georgia.
now
with
federal
judgments,
they
will
just
allow
you
to
file
it
on
the
record,
but
with
out-of-state
judgments,
you
have
to
come
in
and
file
suit.
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
to
require
the
out
of
state
judgments
to
do
this.
it
doesn't
really
deny
the
substantive
right
whereas
if
i
wait
to
seven
years,
i've
lost
my
substantive
right
to
enforce
that
judgment
with
--
after
four
years,
i
can
still
enforce
my
out-of-state
judgment
even
though
i
have
to
go
a
little
bit
more
stringent
procedure
to
do
it,
if
it
is
an
out-of-state
judgment.
now,
on
domestic
judgment,
i
had
really
lost
anything
substantive
wheras
i
have
with
foregin
judgments
under
the
statute
of
limitations
discriminations.
mr.
william
g.
vance
i'd
like
to
first
point
out,
your
honors,
that
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
appellee
in
his
brief
and
in
the
argument
do
not
involve
cases
where
any
discrimination
was
alleged.
all
they
hold
is
that
a
statute
of
limitation
may
be
enacted
against
foreign
judgments.
we
do
not
question
that
proposition.
we
have
no
argument
to
that
proposition.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
i
think
there
might
have
been
a
little
confusion
only
as
to
that
--
while
this
is
an
equal
protection
case,
it
is
also
full
faith
and
credit
case
and
we
think
we
have
a
very
good
full
faith
and
credit
case
here.
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
it's
even
worse
than
that
as
far
as
it
goes.
i
think
in
m'elmoyle,
they
said
that
there
was
a
20-year
presumption
against
domestic
judgments
at
that
time.
so
it
was
20
instead
of
ten
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct.
that's
what
they
discussed
in
this.
so
it
did
exist
in
the
m'elmoyle
but
i
don't
just
believe
that
was
an
issue
there.
it
was
not
raised.
if
you
look
at
the
argument
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
even
though
this
was
recognized,
if
you
look
at
the
argument
of
counsel
in
the
--
prior
to
the
opinion
it's
clear
that
this
point
was
not
argued
and
that
really
was
not
considered
in
that
context
by
the
court
as
being
an
argument
to
vitiate
the
statute.
if
you
read
–
mr.
william
g.
vance
well,
your
honor,
if
you
read
the
metcalf
opinion,
you
will
note
that
that
was
dealing
with
federal
judgments
(voice
overlap)
out-of-state
judgment
and
the
court
felt
constrained
to
overrule
a
prior
wisconsin
supreme
court
case
interpreting
its
own
statute
so
there
would
be
no
discrimination
between
the
period
of
time
for
federal
judgment
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
william
g.
vance
yes,
sir.
as
federal
versus
domestic
in
that
case
and
the
supremacy
clause
was
involved
rather
than
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
but
i
think
the
same
considerations
of
policy
were
involved.
and
there,
the
court
went
on
to
overrule
a
wisconsin
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
in
order
not
to
rule
the
period
of
limitation
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
professor
carrie,
who
is
probably
the
expert
on
full
faith
and
credit
probably
the
most
renown
authority
has
felt
that
hughes
v.
fetter
and
wells
v.
simonds
abrasive
were
really
equal
protection
cases
and
should
have
been
decided
on
the
equal
protection
clause
rather
than
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
of
course,
equal
protection
was
not
raised
in
those
two
cases
so
it
was
not
discussed
by
the
case.
but
he
felt
that
this
case
was
proper
rather
than
full
faith
and
credit
cases
and
should
--
by
the
same
token
if
the
same
reasoning
applies
with
respect
to
that
statute.
