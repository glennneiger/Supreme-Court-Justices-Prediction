mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
back
to
this
court
questions
arising
out
of
the
factual
context
of
the
illegal
raids,
arrests
and
seizures
of
the
records
and
membership
lists
of
our
southern
civil
rights
organization
which
was
the
background
for
this
court's
decision
in
dombrowski
against
pfister
in
the
october
'64
term.
the
complaint
in
this
case
charge
the
conspiracy
between
these
respondents,
senator
james
eastland,
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
internal
security
of
the
senate
and
j.g.
sourwine,
the
committee
counsel,
and
several
louisiana
state
officials
including
mr.
pfister,
the
chairman
of
un-american
activities
committee
of
the
louisiana
--
joint
committee
of
the
louisiana
legislature
and
several
louisiana
police
officers.
to
--
under
the
cover
of
louisiana
anti-subversive
laws,
this
is
a
law
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
dombrowski,
to
utilize
illegal
police
raids,
arrests
and
seizures,
all
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
order
of
the
complaint
charges
to
seize
records
and
lists
of
names
of
members
and
supporters
of
this
civil
rights
organization
which
records
and
lists
of
names
would
have
been
impossible
or
extremely
difficult
for
these
legislative
co-conspirators
to
obtain
lawfully
under
this
court's
own
decisions
in
naacp
against
alabama
to
recently
in
gibson
against
florida
as
the
court
is
of
course
aware.
since
naacp
against
alabama,
the
court
has
stressed
constantly
the
chilling
effect
upon
constitutional
rights
of
citizen
of
a
demand
for
list
of
names
of
supporters
of
southern
negro
movements
for
equality.
now,
the
complaint
charges
that
the
plan
and
conspiracy
was
all
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
these
plaintiffs
and
discouraging
them
and
their
supporters
from
asserting
and
attempting
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
negro
citizens
of
louisiana
in
the
deep
south.
the
plaintiffs
ask
for
damages
and
certain
injunctive
relief.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
complaint
alleges
that
they
participated
fully
in
this
conspiracy.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
in
the
first
allegation,
the
general
allegation
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
now,
in
addition
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
you're
right,
justice
fortas.
that's
the
general
allegation
but
there
is
a
specific
allegations
also
as
to
these
particular
respondents
in
paragraph
20
of
the
complaint,
page
7,
and
paragraph
22
of
the
complaint,
very
specific
allegations
of
activities
on
the
part
of
these
respondents
in
furthering
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
those
facts
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right
justice
fortas.
those
very
specific
facts
of
their
participation
in
the
initiation
of
the
conspiracy
emerged
in
respondents'
own
motion
for
summary
judgment,
their
own
affidavits
and
the
testimony
of
respondents
sourwine
on
deposition.
very
specific
facts
emerged
as
to
their
participation
in
what
this
court
called
in
the
general
motors
case,
a
joint
collaboration
in
the
initiation
of
the
original
conspiracy.
those
facts
are
very
clear.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly,
the
facts
which
emerged
from
the
affidavits
and
from
their
own
respondent,
sourwine's
testimony
were
these
following
facts.
in
the
summer
1963,
certain
private
discussions
took
place
between
respondent
sourwine
and
one
of
the
co-conspirators,
rogers
who
was
the
--
one
of
the
counsels
to
the
alleged
louisiana
joint
committee.
during
this
private
correspondence
--
private
discussions
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
records
and
membership
list
of
the
civil
rights
organization
were
discussed.
that's
july
'63,
fact
one,
uncontested
by
the
respondents.
secondly,
the
plan
not
to
use
the
legislative
subpoena
but
to
use
the
police
raids
instead
to
seize
the
records
emerged
in
late
august
or
early
september
according
to
their
own
testimony.
and
there's
a
very
interesting
affidavit
which
emerged
in
the
louisiana
branch
of
this
litigation
which
is
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
an
affidavit
from
one
of
louisiana
co-conspirators
which
pinpoints
the
plan
at
a
meeting
in
late
august
in
‘63
which
they
developed
what
they
called
operation
cheap
talk
to
see
the
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
they
were
not
present
at
that
meeting.
the
next
fact
which
emerges
from
the
record
is
after
the
plan
had
gelled,
another
private
discussion
took
place
in
the
middle
of
september
between
sourwine
and
between
rogers.
this
is
after
the
plan
had
gelled.
a
private
discussion
took
place
in
which
they
further
discussed
the
civil
rights
organization's
records.
shortly
thereafter,
the
record
shows,
shortly
thereafter,
the
plan
was
put
into
operation
and
sourwine
in
his
own
testimony
--
i'm
sorry,
rogers
in
his
own
testimony
describes
the
development
of
the
plan,
the
seizures
then
took
place
shortly
thereafter
on
october
4th.
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
absolutely,
justice
fortas.
and
i
would
say
that
the
measurements,
the
yardstick
for
the
type
of
evidence
required
to
go
to
trial
on
this
issue
and
the
conspiracy
question
which
the
court
discussed
last
term
in
general
motors
per
se.
we
are
not
required,
as
the
government
was
not
required
in
general
motors
to
prove
explicit
agreements
in
the
conspiracy,
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
cbs
case
in
poller
against
cbs.
now
in
the
summary
judgment
question,
it
is
impossible
when
a
conspiracy,
where
the
evidence
is
securely
in
the
hands
of
the
co-conspirators
and
hostile
witnesses
to
show
explicit
agreement.
i
would
suggest
that
on
these
facts,
the
court
has
never
had
a
sharper
case
in
which
there
was
evidence
at
least
requiring
ads.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
justice
fortas
that
this
--
the
circuit
court
here,
the
district
of
columbia
found
that
on
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
respondents
were
participants
in
the
plan
on
the
conspiracy,
that
circuit
court
here
found
that
there
were
disputed
issues
of
facts
which
would
require
resolution
by
trial.
it's
very
interesting
in
that
respect.
the
circuit
court
disagreed
with
the
respondents
on
their
major
thrust
to
the
argument.
the
main
thrust
of
the
argument
of
the
respondents
below
was
they
had
an
alternative
position,
a)
that
we
had
not
put
forward
a
serious
claim
that
these
respondents
as
justice
fortas
asked
the
question
were
participants
in
the
conspiracy.
that
was
their
main
argument.
and
summary
judgment
should
be
granted.
they
had
an
alternative
argument
that
even
if
they
were
participants
in
the
conspiracy,
even
if
they
had
participated
in
the
illegal
police
seizures
and
raids,
nevertheless
the
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity
protected
them.
it
was
an
alternative
argument.
now,
in
the
court
below,
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
what
is
so
interesting
here,
the
posture
of
the
case
now
before
this
court
is
that
the
court
below
rejected
their
main
contention
and
said,
“were
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case?
then
we
would
be
constraint
to
have
great
difficulty
to
find
that
there
were
not
disputed
issues
of
facts
upon
involving
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
which
would
require
exploration
by
a
trial.”
so
that
the
respondents
are
here
before
this
court
in
effect
asking
this
court
to
reject
the
conclusion
of
the
lower
court
that
as
to
the
court
and
justice
fortas
asked,
there
are
sufficient
disputed
issues
to
require
retrial.
now,
if
i
can
give
another
example
justice
fortas
which
led
the
district
--
the
circuit
court
to
the
conclusion
that
there
had
to
be
a
trial
to
resolve
these
issues.
take
the
formulations
in
the
general
motors
case,
not
only
in
respect
to
the
initiation
of
the
conspiracy
in
respect
to
its
execution.
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
more
than
adequate
evidence
here
to
show
the
joint
collaboration
of
the
co-conspirators
to
execute
it.now,
what
does
this
record
show?
it
shows
the
most
extraordinary
maneuver
which
took
place
on
october
4th
in
new
orleans.
in
24
hours,
the
following
things
happened.
as
a
result
of
the
plan,
operation
cheap
talk,
as
a
result
of
the
plan
to
use
police
machinery
to
seize
these
records,
the
police
came
in
and
as
this
court
knows
in
dombrowski,
pfister
where
the
description
of
the
raids
are
set
forth,
grabbed
all
of
the
records,
everything
in
the
offices
of
the
organization
and
mr.
smith
is
watching
the
lawyers.
now,
by
the
police
doing
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i'm
sorry
justice
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh!
the
records
of
mr.
smith
and
mr.
waltzer,
the
attorney
in
the
dombrowski,
pfister
who
were
also
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
--
they're
on
that
party
during
this
action.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes
chief
justice?
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly,
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
--
i
apologize.
i
apologize.
now,
the
immediate
effect
of
the
police
seizures
was
to
deprive
the
civil
rights
organization
of
any
opportunity
to
defend
against
a
legislative
subpoena
of
these
records
by
doing
the
conventional
thing
of
coming
in
to
quash
the
subpoena.
they
couldn't
do
it
because
the
police
grabbed
it
immediately.
but
then
look
what
happened.
instantaneously,
the
records
were
then
turned
over
to
the
louisiana
committee
with
the
subpoena
all
prepared
for
forthwith
production
of
everything
seized
and
then
that
night,
the
record
shows,
and
this
i
think
justice
fortas
goes
to
your
question
again.
that
night,
the
record
shows
that
rogers
got
on
the
telephone
to
sourwine,
said,
“alright,
we've
got
the
records,
come
on
down
to
louisiana.”
the
next
morning,
sourwine
arrives
in
louisiana
with
blank
subpoenas
signed
by
the
chairman
but
completely
in
blank.
subpoenas
incidentally
as
the
argument
will
later
show,
totally
unauthorized
by
the
senate
committee
itself
and
these
subpoenas
are
then
copied
verbatim
from
the
louisiana
subpoena
which
in
turn
was
copied
verbatim
from
the
warrant
of
arrest
later
declared
of
course
totally
illegal
and
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment,
in
other
words,
they
wrote
out
general
warrants,
warrants
of
assistance
right
then
and
there.
now
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i'm
sorry.
rogers
was
the
counsel
to
the
louisiana
legislative
committee.
i
asked
the
court
to
consider
what
happened
in
that
24
hours.
on
the
one
hand,
the
organization
and
the
plaintiffs
were
deprived
of
the
right,
the
ability
to
defend
against
the
legislative
subpoena.
at
the
end
of
the
24
hours,
they
were
deprived
of
their
opportunity
to
use
the
criminal
processes
to
go
in
and
move
to
quash
and
vacate
the
warrant
and
to
ask
for
a
return
of
the
books
and
records
because
at
the
end
of
the
24
hours
from
the
police
they
were
then
in
the
hands
of
a
legislative
committee
and
that
is
in
effect
what
happened
because
incidentally
this
was
all
secret.
nobody
knew
anything
about
this.
it
all
came
out
two
weeks
later,
when
we
went
into
the
louisiana
state
court
and
we
moved
to
vacate
the
warrants
of
arrest
and
this
motion
was
granted.
the
grant
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
we
then
got
up
and
we
said,
alright,
we
ask
the
state
court
to
order
that
the
books
and
records
and
membership
lists
be
returned
to
the
organization.
at
that
moment,
for
the
first
time,
we
learned
about
this
24-hour
maneuver.
because
at
that
moment
the
state
officials
got
up
and
said,
“we're
very
sorry,
we
cannot
return
these
books
and
records
because
they
are,
although
physically
here
in
louisiana,
they
are
in
the
custody
of
senator
eastland,
and
we
cannot
return
them.”
the
state
court
said,
“i'm
sorry,
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.”
and
the
books
and
records
were
not
returned.
then
the
third
phase
of
the
conspiracy
unquoted.
that
was
the
first
time
anybody,
ourselves
or
the
pubic,
knew
about
the
activities
of
these
respondents.
it's
very
significant
i
think
that
it
was
a
secret.
normally,
a
senate
committee
when
it
subpoenaed
something,
normally,
it's
in
the
newspapers,
they'll
issue
a
press
release,
this
was
very
secret.
we
didn't
know
about
it
until
that
state
court.
so
what
did
we
do?
we
then
went
into
the
federal
district
court
that
was
on
friday,
the
state
decision
came
down
saturday.
we
went
into
the
federal
district
court.
we
instituted
the
first
what
i
would
call,
the
louisiana
branch
of
this
litigation.
we
instituted
an
action
identical
to
this
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana
asking
for
damages,
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
and
for
the
return
of
the
books
and
records
injunctive
relief.
saturday,
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
court.
sunday
morning,
we
appeared
before
federal
district
judge
then
federal
district
judge
ainsworth
and
ask
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
issue
against
the
turning
over
of
these
records
physically
because
they
were
still
in
the
state
of
louisiana
to
these
respondents.
the
judge
then
asked
the
louisiana
officials
who
were
in
that
court,
“can
i
have
your
assurances
that
these
records
are
in
louisiana?”
and
they
said,
“yes,
they're
in
baton
rouge.”
mr.
arthur
kinoy
all
in
the
record
they
come
out
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
sourwine
and
affidavits
and
i
believe
they
are
uncontested.
at
that
point,
the
judge
told
us,
“send
a
telegram
to
the
respondents
including
senator
eastland.”
a
telegram
which
says,
“i'm
sending
down
this
tro
for
a
hearing
tomorrow
morning,
monday
morning.
and
the
tro
will
involve
an
injunction
to
restrain
turning
these
records
claimed
to
be
illegally
seized
over
to
you
and
i
request
your
presence.”
the
telegram
went
to
senator
eastland
that
in
sourwine's
testimony.
that
was
sunday.
at
10
o'clock
sunday
night,
senator
eastland,
respondent
here,
got
that
telegram.
he
then
got
on
the
telephone
to
respondent
sourwine
and
these
are
sourwine's
words,
not
ours.
senator
eastland
then
told
sourwine,
“get
those
records
out
of
louisiana.”
sourwine
protested,
“it
was
hard
to
do
it
that
night.”
he
said,
“well,
take
them
across
the
state
line
to
mississippi,
to
woodville,
mississippi.”
sourwine
then
called
one
of
the
louisiana
state
officials
also
a
co-defe
--
codefendant
in
the
actions
and
said,
“get
those
records
out
of
louisiana.”
at
12
o'clock
that
night,
a
van
arrived
in
baton
rouge,
took
all
of
the
records,
membership
lists
and
everything
else
out
of
louisiana
across,
i
think
the
court
can
take
notice
that
woodville,
mississippi
is
across
the
state
boundary,
took
those
records
into
woodville,
mississippi.
the
next
morning
we
appeared
in
federal
judge
ainsworth's
courtroom
in
response
to
the
tro.
and
when
the
judge
called
the
matter
to
be
heard,
the
state
officials
got
up
and
said,
“we're
very
sorry
your
honor,
the
books
and
records
are
no
longer
in
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
they
are
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
of
louisiana,”
where
i
ask
this
court
what
possible
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
that
conduct?
surely
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
are
entitled
to
draw
on
inference
of
a)
guilty
knowledge
on
the
part
of
these
respondents,
that
the
books
and
records
were
illegally
seized.
surely,
we
are
entitled
to
draw
an
inference
that
in
addition
to
that,
these
respondents
were
attempting
to
pursue
the
objectives
of
the
conspiracy.
i
would
suggest
that
short
of
actual
confessions
in
the
record,
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
further
evidence
which
would
--
would
require
to
withstand
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
now,
there
has
never
been
an
explanation
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
of
that
sunday
evening.
one
explanation
sourwine
suggested
on
his
deposition
that
the
federal
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
anyway.
well,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
don't
have
to
explore
very
fully
that
response,
perfectly
easy
for
an
attorney
to
go
into
the
federal
district
judge's
chambers
the
next
morning
and
say
“your
honor,
you
can
issue
any
temporary
restraining
order
but
you
have
no
jurisdiction.”
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
the
real
motivations
emerged
from
respondents
sourwine,
the
admission
in
the
testimony
that
he
did
it
because
he
thought
and
these
were
his
words,
he
would
be
in
an
awkward
situation,
if
the
records
were
not
removed.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
was
more
than
--
that
this
was
the
reason
why
the
district
court
--
the
circuit
court
below
rejected
out
of
their
hand
the
respondent's
contention
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
trial
and
the
issue
with
their
participation
of
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
district
of
columbia
court
below.
now,
the
thing
that
is
so
interesting
if
i
can
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
in
this
court
the
respondents
now
shifting
their
positions.
once
again
they
are
arguing
to
the
court
without
explaining
that
they
have
to
persuade
the
court
to
push
aside
the
conclusions
of
the
circuit
below.
once
again,
they
come
here
and
they
argue
that
summary
judgment
was
proper
there
was
no
evidence
to
go
to
it.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
right,
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
luncheon
recess,
i
had
remarked
that
in
this
court,
the
respondents
have
seem
to
shift
the
main
thrust
of
their
position
back
to
in
effect
urging
the
court
to
reject
the
conclusion
on
the
factual
record
of
the
lower
court.
now,
this
shift
may
in
certain
respects
be
due
to
the
intervening
impact
of
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
parallel
louisiana
litigation
which
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
may
throw
considerable
light
on
the
problems
presented
in
this
case.
in
that
parallel
litigation
instituted
in
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana,
defendant
pfister
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
un-american
activities
committee
of
the
louisiana
legislature
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
--
in
an
identical
complaint,
on
the
ground
that
he
was
protected
by
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity.
judge
ainsworth
rejected
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
disputed
fact
as
to
pfister's
participation
in
the
plan
and
the
raids,
that
these
disputed
fact
as
to
its
participation
in
the
raids,
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
judge
ainsworth
said,
his
activity,
which
he
is
charged
in
the
complaint,
was
legitimate
legislative
activity
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
tenney-brandhove.
then
a
very
curious
thing
happened.
pfister
interpleaded
as
third
party
defendants,
all
of
the
members
of
the
louisiana
legislative
committee
saying
that
he
was
responsible,
so
were
they.
they
came
in
before
judge
ainsworth.
they
move
to
for
summary
judgment
also
on
the
ground
they
were
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity.
judge
ainsworth
granted
their
motions.
pfister
then
appealed
that
decision
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
this
november,
november
1966,
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
circuit
judge
wisdom,
reversed
the
granting
of
summary
judgment
as
to
the
members
of
the
legislative
committee
in
an
opinion
which
i
would
suggest
puts
its
finger
upon
the
conceptual
confusion
which
i
think
is
present
in
the
circuit
court's
opinion
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
case.
judge
wisdom
pointed
out
in
arceneaux
against
pfister,
we
have
included
for
the
court's
convenience
judge
wisdom's
written
opinion
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
judge
wisdom
made
the
following
analysis,
and
he
said,
“there
are
disputed
issues
of
facts
as
to
whether
these
third
party
defendants
had
any
knowledge
of
the
plan
to
use
police
raids,
or
participated
in
any
way
in
the
planning
and
initiation
and
carrying
out
of
this
conspiracy.
there
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
as
to
that.”
that
in
turn,
judge
wisdom
pointed
out,
not
only
precludes
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
to
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
but
precludes
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
to
their
defense
of
legislative
immunity.
because
judge
wisdom
then
pointed
out
that
the
issue
of
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
undisputed
issue
raises
he
said
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
legitimate
legislative
activity
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
tenney
and
to
drive
this
point
home,
judge
wisdom
italicized
in
the
opinion
the
word
‘legitimate'
in
the
quotation
from
the
court's
opinion
in
tenney.
accordingly,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
ordered
that
these
defendants
also
must
stand
trial.
now,
what
is
the
situation
therefore
in
the
parallel
louisiana
litigation?
these
cases
are
on
the
ready-jury
calendar.
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
cases
must
go
to
trial,
judge
ainsworth
granted
a
permissive
appeal
to
pfister
from
the
denial
of
his
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
appeal.
all
of
the
louisiana
officials
including
the
legislative
officials
will
stand
trial
in
federal
district
court
in
louisiana,
in
the
cases
on
the
ready-jury
calendar.
now
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
no
judge
stewart.
no,
they
are
in
the
case.
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
granted
by
the
district
court
has
been
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
right.
they
are
impleaded
now
justice
stewart.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
they
are
defendants
and
they
will
stand
trial.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
but
all
the
other
police
officials
are
in.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
police
officials,
the
staff
director
of
the
louisiana
committee,
alexander,
and
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
rogers
was
never
joined
as
a
defendant.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
they
were
named
but
they
were
not
served.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
couldn't
serve
them
until
we
reached
them
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
they
have.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
and
not
served.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
identical
to
that
case.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
exactly
right
and
they
will
stand
trial
there.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
analysis
of
judge
wisdom
in
the
arceneaux
case
places
a
spotlight
on
the
problem
before
this
court
because
in
essence
what
the
court
faces
here
is
the
sharp
fact
that
the
conduct
charged
to
these
respondents
in
the
participation
in
the
illegal
raid
and
seizure,
and
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
deemed
to
be
if
in
fact
they
participated
in
this
a
legitimate
legislative
activity
protected
by
the
scope
of
this
featured
debate
clause.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh!
justice
fortas,
no,
i
would
make
no
distinction
because
for
the
purposes
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
neither
of
the
two
phases
which
you
described
would
be
sufficient
to
invoke
the
doctrine.
the
respondents
suggest
that
the
latter
phase,
the
use
of
the
unauthorized
subpoena
in
some
way
is
sufficient
to
invoke
the
doctrine.
my
suggestion
to
that
is
that
the
short
answer
to
that
is
kilbourn-thompson,
and
every
subsequent
decision
of
this
court
on
the
immunity
question.
in
kilbourn
which
this
court
in
the
gojack
decision
just
last
term,
so
a
reason
to
describe
as
the
leading
case
on
the
subject,
in
kilbourn,
the
warrant
of
arrest
did
not
serve
to
immunize
the
sergeant
at
arms
from
tort
liability
for
the
wrongful
arrest.
similarly
here,
the
subpoenas
are
insufficient
to
immunize
the
respondents
from
tort
liability
for
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
for
several
reasons.
first,
a
search
and
seizure
itself,
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
as
the
court
described
in
the
stanford
case,
the
same
term
that
dombrowski-pfister
was
decided,
search
and
seizure
of
this
nature,
stanford
very
interesting
case
because
it
involved
a
raid
identical
to
this
raid,
a
raid
under
the
anti-subversive
laws
of
texas.
and
this
court
described
that
raid,
the
same
thing
happened,
they
took
all
the
books
and
records,
everything
from
the
office.
the
court
described
this
raid
as
a
constitutionally
impermissible
act.
now,
if
this
kind
of
a
raid
on
a
general
warrant,
is
a
constitutionally
impermissible
act,
it
is
no
less
or
constitutionally
impermissible.
it's
in
the
same
caliber
as
the
warrant
of
arrest
in
kilbourn
which
the
court
said
was
not
sufficient
to
immunize
the
sergeant
in
kilbourn-thompson
from
a
suit
for
damages.
now,
secondly,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
subpoenas
issued
in
blank
were
themselves
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
that
is
the
problem
which
the
respondents
have
not
coped
with
because
the
incredible
aspect
of
the
record
is
that
these
subpoenas
in
blank
which
were
filled
out
that
morning
in
baton
rouge
were
copied
identically
from
the
state
subpoena
which
was
based
upon
the
criminal
warrant.
these
were
stricken
and
the
court
remarked
in
dombrowski-pfister,
these
were
stricken
as
illegal,
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
they
were
like
the
warrants
in
stanford.
they
were
what
the
court
in
stanford
called
absolutely
identical
to
general
warrants,
the
writs
of
assistance.
now
it,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
is
impossible
to
assert
that
the
use
of
a
general
warrant
or
a
writ
of
assistance
is
legitimate
legislative
activity
in
any
sense
of
the
work
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
stanford,
not
since
the
statement
of
james
otis
in
the
revolutionary
period.
has
any
court
in
this
country
has
any
legislative
body
ever
suggested
that
the
use
of
a
general
warrant,
a
writ
of
assistance
could
conceivably
be
considered
legitimate
legislative
activity.
now,
thirdly,
the
blank
subpoenas
which
incidentally
now
are
the
only
shred
these
respondents
hold
to
on
adoption
of
legislative
immunity
here.
they
don't
assert
as
they
did
below
that
if
they
really
participated
in
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
that
they
initiated,
planned
or
helped
it
along
as
we
discussed
earlier
this
morning,
they
don't
really
assert
that
adoption
of
legislative
immunity
could
protect
that.
that's
difficult
to
assert.
the
only
shred
of
holding
to
the
doctrine
is
the
use
of
this
subpoena.
but
the
subpoena
itself
not
only
is
illegal,
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
the
writ
of
assistance
but
was
totally
unauthorized
by
the
committee
itself.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
and
i
address
myself
only
to
this
justice
stewart
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
featured
debate
clause
problem.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
and
in
that
respect,
in
addition
to
the
illegality
of
the
subpoena
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
respondents
here
concede
in
their
brief
that
this
subpoena
issued
in
blank
and
then
filled
out
in
baton
rouge
was
wholly
unauthorized
by
the
senate
subcommittee.
however,
the
respondents
say
this
is
a
minor
technical
question.
this
is
a
question
which
can
be
cured,
would
later
cure.
i
would
suggest
that
the
suggestion
that
the
unauthorized
use
of
a
subpoena
in
the
area
of
investigation
into
the
rights
of
citizens
under
the
first
amendment
is
no
minor
technical
matter.
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
watkins,
to
the
decisions
last
term
in
gojack,
it
seems
clear
that
the
court
has
said
that
as
a
minimum,
as
a
minimal
out
of
boundary
of
legislative
power
in
the
area
of
the
use
of
compulsory
process
to
investigate
into
activities
associations
of
citizen
within
the
framework
of
the
first
amendment
as
an
outer
minimal
boundary,
the
court
has
directed
the
concept
of
the
requirements
of
authorization
for
such
legislative
activity.
now,
this
is
no
minor
technical
question.
in
watkins,
this
court
said,
that
that
requirements
of
authorization
went
to
the
heart
of
the
preservation
of
limited
constitutional
government
that
at
a
minimum
putting
aside
the
impact
of
an
authorized
subpoena
upon
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right
that
at
the
minimum
the
exerci
--
the
use
of
the
requirement
of
authorization
chartered
the
out
of
boundaries,
the
outer
boundaries
of
legislative
power.
it
would
seem
therefore
that
far
from
being
a
technical
question,
the
use
of
a
subpoena
is
so
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
self-written
as
a
general
writ
of
assistance
and
itself
not
authorized
by
the
senate
subcommittee
could
never
be
conceived
of
as
legitimate
legislative
activity
within
the
meaning
of
this
featured
debate
clause.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
was.
it
was
submitted
as
such.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
it
could.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
the
record
show
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
was
not
filled
in.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
about
three
months
later,
yes.
two
months
later,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
now,
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
doesn't
cure.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
under
gojack
and
on
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
would
point
out
justice
fortas
also
that
in
the
examination
of
the
resolution
of
the
senate
committee
there
is
some
question
even
about
that
which
we
were
not
permitted
to
fully
litigate
in
the
district
court.
senator
keating
raised
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
ratification
actually
took
place
and
that
sort
to
take
the
deposition
of
senator
keating
but
i
could
not
get
an
adjournment
in
trying
to
take
that,
but
putting
aside
that,
in
the
examination
of
the
resolution
itself,
very
interesting
because
the
resolution
does
not
specifically
say
that
we
authorize
the
issuance
of
that
subpoena
or
we
think
that
subpoena
was
properly
authorized.
all
the
resolution
says
that
these
documents
which
we
now
have
here
can
be
put
in
our
record.
and
after
they
put
in
our
record,
they
should
be
sent
back
to
new
orleans.
so
i
would
suggest
that
even
on
that
level
there
was
no
direct
authorization
but
i
do
not
rest
on
that,
because
i
think
it
--
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
why
authorization
is
so
critically
required
in
this
entire
area.
now,
i
would
suggest
then
that
any
effort
to
invoke
the
legislative
immunity
doctrine
here
runs
in
the
face
of
this
court's
own
definitions
from
kilbourn
to
united
stated
against
johnson
itself
as
to
the
limits
which
must
be
fenced
around
the
privilege.
i
find
it
helpful
for
example,
the
opinion
of
the
english
courts
in
stockdale-hansard
which
this
court
in
kilbourn
said
represented
the
basis
of
the
thinking
that
went
into
the
immunity
concept
itself,
to
the
clause
itself.
and
in
stockdale,
the
court
will
recall,
the
english
court
felt
that
it
was
essential
if
the
liberties
of
citizens
are
to
be
protected
if
the
double
pole
which
is
exercised
in
the
emergence
of
the
immunity,
one
pole
toward
the
independence
and
free
speech
of
the
legislature,
the
other
pole
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
citizens
to
exercise
fundamental
liberties
and
to
be
protected
by
a
remedy
in
the
court
of
law
against
infringement
of
those
liberties.
if
those
two
poles
are
to
be
reconciled
and
they
must
be,
said
the
court
in
stockdale
and
this
court
in
kilbourn,
then
we
must
as
the
english
court
said,
we
must
fence
in
the
privilege
by
the
law.
that
is
our
responsibility.
we
must
fence
in
the
privilege
by
the
law.
and
the
court
did
that
in
kilbourn.
and
the
court
said
that
the
illegal
act
of
arrest
does
not
protect
the
sergeant
of
arms
and
a
money
judgment
will
lie
and
was
later,
actually
collected
against
the
sergeant
of
arms.
secondly,
the
court,
justice
miller
said
in
kilbourn,
if
the
members
of
the
congress
themselves
had
participated
in
the
arrest
in
anyway,
he
says,
they
would
be
liable
as
the
sergeant
of
arms.
they
are
protected
for
what?
only
the
pure
legislative
act,
the
passage
of
the
resolution
authorized,
that
alone
says
the
justice
in
kilbourn
would
protect
them.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
i'm
not
arguing
that
justice
fortas
and
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
or
reach
that
in
this
situation,
not
at
all.
i
think
--
i
would
suggest
that
the
definition
in
tenney
based
upon
the
definition
in
kilbourn
is
sufficient
here
that
where
the
act
is
not
an
act
traditionally
within
the
power
of
the
legislative
--
legitimate
legislative
activity
where
it
is
as
in
kilbourn,
an
unlawful
illegal
arrest
where
it
is
as
here
in
dombrowski,
eastland,
an
unlawful
search
or
seizure.
then
clearly
that
is
the
line,
that
is
where
the
law
offenses
in
the
immunity.
and
at
that
point,
the
courts
of
law
are
obligated
to
provide
the
remedy
to
protect
the
citizen.
and
at
that
point
the
legislative
immunity
is
found
at
all.
now,
some
suggestions
has
been
made
that
if
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
involvement
with
the
state
officials,
justice
white,
goes
to
the
availability
of
the
civil
rights
act
course
of
action
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
yes.
i
would
have
it
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
correct.
that's
correct
justice
white.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
remedy
is
offered
for
on
the
color
of
state
law
and
that
is
available,
i
would
suggest,
in
this
situation.
but
as
far
as
the
basic
thrust
of
the
illegality
is
concerned,
the
illegality
stands
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
participation
by
the
state
officials.
yes,
i
would
suggest
that
justice
white.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
made
by
the
respondents
that
perhaps
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
bar,
the
official
immunity
doctrine
might
conceivably
be
available
perhaps
to
respondent
sourwine.
i
don't
want
to
spend
very
much
time
on
that
except
to
point
out
that
from,
that
the
doctrine
and
concept
which
this
court
developed
in
bar,
a
judicially
constructed
doctrine
grounded
on
the
principles
and
concepts
of
the
common
law,
points
an
answer
to
this
problem
in
the
common
law
because
in
the
classic
case
involving
remedies
for
searches
and
seizures,
entick
against
carrington,
the
english
court
not
only
found
for
the
plaintiff
on
an
action
but
permitted
damages
against
his
majesty,
secretary
of
state,
an
order
that
damages
issue.
why?
because
the
english
court
in
entick
said
in
carrington
that
the
interest
in
preserving
the
fundamental
liberties
of
the
citizen,
the
subject
in
that
case
is
such
a
deep-seated
requirement
that
a
remedy
and
damages
far
from
interfering
with
the
operations
of
government
is
essential
if
government
is
going
to
what?
is
going
to
view
two
constitutional
lines.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
recent
decisions
of
the
circuit
courts,
three
of
the
circuits
have
refused
to
apply
any
doctrine
or
concept
of
immunity
to
the
charge
of
participation
in
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
this
is
too
fundamental
over
a
question.
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
functioning
of
government
itself
within
the
framework
of
constitutional
law.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
in
dombrowski-pfister,
before
the
court
two
terms
ago.
the
issues
here
transcend
the
immediate
question
here
presented
as
compelling
as
they
are
for
relief.
and
as
in
dombrowski-pfister
the
problem
is
here
posed
as
to
whether
this
court
will
say
that
under
this
system
of
ordered
law,
a
remedy
exists
for
the
protection
of
fundamental
liberties
of
the
people
and
that
this
remedy
will
be
available
and
that
lawless
activity
of
individuals
regardless
of
their
station
in
society
are
subject
to
the
processes
of
the
law
and
that
the
law
stands
ready
to
provide
this
relief.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
within
this
concept,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
these
respondents
should
be
required
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
presented
in
this
complaint.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
don't
think
a
definitive
ruling
is
possible
justice
harlan
without
a
development
of
fact
and
i
think
that
that's
exactly
what
justice
wis
--
judge
wisdom
was
getting
at.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's'
right.
i
think
that
a
full
development
of
facts
is
required
here
and
that
therefore
this
should
be
sent
back
for
a
trial
on
the
facts.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
57.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
a
few
remarks
to
make
in
rebuttal.
i
think
the
issue
is
a
rather
fully
and
complete
before
the
court.
just
on
a
factual
question,
the
court
addressed
the
question
as
to
whether
the
telegram
to
the
senator
was
on
the
directions
of
the
judge
and
the
transcript
on
page
29
has
a
affidavit
which
says,
“on
instructions
from
judge
ainsworth
to
notify
the
other
parties
to
be
present
in
his
office
at
9:00
am
on
the
morning
of
monday,
october
28,
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
the
request
for
temporary
restraining
order.
telegrams
were
sent
to
all
of
defendants,
green,
burbank
and
willie.”
that's
in
--
on
page
29
of
the
record.
the
telegram
was
sent
at
the
instructions
of
judge
ainsworth.
that
affidavit
has
never
been
controverted.
i
just
have
one
or
two
other
remarks
that
i
would
like
to
make.
a
suggestion
has
been
made
that
perhaps
in
some
way,
the
doctrines
developed
by
this
court
in
barr,
the
immunity
doctrines,
may
save
the
respondents
here.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
as
was
mentioned
by
the
court,
the
question
in
barr
was
of
course
tort
and
liability
on
defamation.
there
was
no
intimation
in
barr
to
the
slightest
degree
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
or
in
the
dissenting
opinions
that
the
court
would
have
take
the
same
view
toward
a
charge
of
participation
in
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
the
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
barr
is
very
clear
that
what
the
court
is
there
talking
about
are
acts,
normal
ordinary
business
acts
in
the
course
of
the
conduct
of
the
government
business
and
i
don't
think
the
court
in
the
majority
of
dissent
in
barr
would
have
ever
intimated
that
the
participation
in
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
would
be
the
kind
of
activity
which
would
invoke
under
any
circumstances
a
man
told
of
immunity
under
barr
and
it's
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
i
would
think
that
if
mr.
robb
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
right.
i
think
--
i
--
in
any
event
from
their
arguments,
i
think
the
respondents
have
been
asserting
that
concept
but
even
if
mr.
robb
does
concede
that,
i
would
say
then
clearly
that
the
issue
there
is
one
of
whether
or
not
the
acts
here
presents
a
contested
issue
of
facts
as
to
participation
in
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
or
the
fruits
of
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
now,
in
that
respect,
i
don't
think
that
the
respondents
here
have
responded
--
have
answered
to
the
simple
proposition
brought
forth
by
the
court
in
kilbourn,
because
kilbourn
is
quite
clear
that
the
use
of
the
warrant
of
arrest
by
the
sergeant
was
no
protection
in
immunity
to
tort
liability.
i
think
the
analogy
is
very
clear
here
for
the
warrant
of
arrest
and
to
the
subpoena.
now,
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
as
i
listened
to
the
argument
of
mr.
robb,
there
would
seem
to
be
no
direct
reputation
of
the
simple
record
fact
that
the
respondents
here
at
a
minimum
engaged
in
activity
taking
the
records
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
louisiana
knowing
that
these
were
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
about
that.
the
louisiana
court
has
so
ruled
in
which
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
they
were
illegally
seized
fruits
of
a
search
and
seizure.
i
would
suggest
on
two
scores,
one,
that
it's
black
letter
conspiracy
law.
that
fact
showing
the
participation
in
the
fruits
of
the
conspiracy
are
certainly
admissible
to
show
the
co-conspirators'
knowledge
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
participation
in
the
conspiracy
and
the
second,
this
black
letter
law
in
respect
to
the
laws
of
the
fourth
amendments,
that
the
participation
in
the
fruits
of
the
illegal
search
and
seizures
are
unconstitutionally
void
as
the
seizure
itself.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
on
friday.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
in
friday
of
our
--
of
the
--
the
removal
was
on
sunday.
the
state
court
decision
was
on
friday
vacating
these
warrants
of
arrests.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
sunday
morning
when
he
directed
a
telegram
and
monday
morning
before
on
the
tro,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
i
--
i
think,
that's
argued
in
full
in
the
brief
with
just
a
word
on
that
justice
stewart
since
you
raised
the
question.
i
think
that
the
argument
of
the
respondents
make
it
very
clear
why
the
equitable
course
of
action
was
essential.
we
ask
simply
for
an
injunction
ordering
the
return
of
the
illegally
seized
records
and
that
copy
should
not
be
used.
we
asked
for
that
in
the
district
court
here
in
washington.
in
the
district
court
in
washington,
we
were
told
by
the
respondents
and
the
courts
that
we
had
--
there
was
no
power,
no
jurisdiction
or
power
in
the
district
court
to
restrain
a
congressional
committee.
the
circuit
court
did
not
follow
that
approach
because
we
were
asking
for
an
injunctive
relief
against
the
individual
respondents.
they
concede
it
that
an
injunction
would
lie
against
the
individual
respondents
but
they
said
it
would
be
futile
to
give
us
that
remedy
because
unilaterally
the
individual
respondents
had
said
that
they
had
no
copies
of
the
documents
and
records
but
it
was
in
the
senate
committee.
this
was
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
justice
stewart.
that's
--
that's
the
heart
of
the
matter
on
the
equitable
relief.
that
fact
was
totally
disputed.
we
don't
know.
mr.
robb
was
unable
to
answer
the
question
as
to
how
many
copies
of
the
record
there
are.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
don't
know.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
justice
stewart,
we
had
no
opportunity
contradicting
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
there
are
statements
that
those
were
the
only
records,
yes
justice
stewart.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
under
oath.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
controvert
those
because
the
district
court
on
the
request
for
tro
dismissed
the
equitable
complaint
not
on
this
factual
issue
but
that
he
had
no
power.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
and
our
position
simply
on
that
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
we
don't
make
issue.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
say
we
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
question.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
an
alternative
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
an
alternative
argument
and
a
subsidiary
argument.
third,
i
would
say
justice
brennan
that
we
argue
that
this
is
additional
evidence
which
would
be
admissible
on
the
original
conspiracy.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
would
seem
so,your
honor,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
seizures
were
on
october
4.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
on
the
24th
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
24th
of
october,
the
arrest
warrants
request,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
subpoenas
were
dated
october
4th,
the
same
time.
there
is
some
conflict
--
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
the
state
of
court
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
subsequent
and
the
action
of
the
respondents
removing
them
from
the
jurisdiction
were
after
the
action
of
the
louisiana
court.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that
was
the
27th.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
justice
white.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
i
would
argue
that
also.
i
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
that
but
i
would
argue,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right
your
honor,
about
the
removal
from
one
place
to
another
i
think
adds
great
inference
and
weight
to
the
conclusions.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
back
to
this
court
questions
arising
out
of
the
factual
context
of
the
illegal
raids,
arrests
and
seizures
of
the
records
and
membership
lists
of
our
southern
civil
rights
organization
which
was
the
background
for
this
court's
decision
in
dombrowski
against
pfister
in
the
october
'64
term.
the
complaint
in
this
case
charge
the
conspiracy
between
these
respondents,
senator
james
eastland,
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
internal
security
of
the
senate
and
j.g.
sourwine,
the
committee
counsel,
and
several
louisiana
state
officials
including
mr.
pfister,
the
chairman
of
un-american
activities
committee
of
the
louisiana
--
joint
committee
of
the
louisiana
legislature
and
several
louisiana
police
officers.
to
--
under
the
cover
of
louisiana
anti-subversive
laws,
this
is
a
law
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
dombrowski,
to
utilize
illegal
police
raids,
arrests
and
seizures,
all
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
order
of
the
complaint
charges
to
seize
records
and
lists
of
names
of
members
and
supporters
of
this
civil
rights
organization
which
records
and
lists
of
names
would
have
been
impossible
or
extremely
difficult
for
these
legislative
co-conspirators
to
obtain
lawfully
under
this
court's
own
decisions
in
naacp
against
alabama
to
recently
in
gibson
against
florida
as
the
court
is
of
course
aware.
since
naacp
against
alabama,
the
court
has
stressed
constantly
the
chilling
effect
upon
constitutional
rights
of
citizen
of
a
demand
for
list
of
names
of
supporters
of
southern
negro
movements
for
equality.
now,
the
complaint
charges
that
the
plan
and
conspiracy
was
all
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
these
plaintiffs
and
discouraging
them
and
their
supporters
from
asserting
and
attempting
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
negro
citizens
of
louisiana
in
the
deep
south.
the
plaintiffs
ask
for
damages
and
certain
injunctive
relief.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
complaint
alleges
that
they
participated
fully
in
this
conspiracy.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
in
the
first
allegation,
the
general
allegation
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
now,
in
addition
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
you're
right,
justice
fortas.
that's
the
general
allegation
but
there
is
a
specific
allegations
also
as
to
these
particular
respondents
in
paragraph
20
of
the
complaint,
page
7,
and
paragraph
22
of
the
complaint,
very
specific
allegations
of
activities
on
the
part
of
these
respondents
in
furthering
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
those
facts
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right
justice
fortas.
those
very
specific
facts
of
their
participation
in
the
initiation
of
the
conspiracy
emerged
in
respondents'
own
motion
for
summary
judgment,
their
own
affidavits
and
the
testimony
of
respondents
sourwine
on
deposition.
very
specific
facts
emerged
as
to
their
participation
in
what
this
court
called
in
the
general
motors
case,
a
joint
collaboration
in
the
initiation
of
the
original
conspiracy.
those
facts
are
very
clear.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly,
the
facts
which
emerged
from
the
affidavits
and
from
their
own
respondent,
sourwine's
testimony
were
these
following
facts.
in
the
summer
1963,
certain
private
discussions
took
place
between
respondent
sourwine
and
one
of
the
co-conspirators,
rogers
who
was
the
--
one
of
the
counsels
to
the
alleged
louisiana
joint
committee.
during
this
private
correspondence
--
private
discussions
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
records
and
membership
list
of
the
civil
rights
organization
were
discussed.
that's
july
'63,
fact
one,
uncontested
by
the
respondents.
secondly,
the
plan
not
to
use
the
legislative
subpoena
but
to
use
the
police
raids
instead
to
seize
the
records
emerged
in
late
august
or
early
september
according
to
their
own
testimony.
and
there's
a
very
interesting
affidavit
which
emerged
in
the
louisiana
branch
of
this
litigation
which
is
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
an
affidavit
from
one
of
louisiana
co-conspirators
which
pinpoints
the
plan
at
a
meeting
in
late
august
in
‘63
which
they
developed
what
they
called
operation
cheap
talk
to
see
the
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
they
were
not
present
at
that
meeting.
the
next
fact
which
emerges
from
the
record
is
after
the
plan
had
gelled,
another
private
discussion
took
place
in
the
middle
of
september
between
sourwine
and
between
rogers.
this
is
after
the
plan
had
gelled.
a
private
discussion
took
place
in
which
they
further
discussed
the
civil
rights
organization's
records.
shortly
thereafter,
the
record
shows,
shortly
thereafter,
the
plan
was
put
into
operation
and
sourwine
in
his
own
testimony
--
i'm
sorry,
rogers
in
his
own
testimony
describes
the
development
of
the
plan,
the
seizures
then
took
place
shortly
thereafter
on
october
4th.
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
absolutely,
justice
fortas.
and
i
would
say
that
the
measurements,
the
yardstick
for
the
type
of
evidence
required
to
go
to
trial
on
this
issue
and
the
conspiracy
question
which
the
court
discussed
last
term
in
general
motors
per
se.
we
are
not
required,
as
the
government
was
not
required
in
general
motors
to
prove
explicit
agreements
in
the
conspiracy,
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
cbs
case
in
poller
against
cbs.
now
in
the
summary
judgment
question,
it
is
impossible
when
a
conspiracy,
where
the
evidence
is
securely
in
the
hands
of
the
co-conspirators
and
hostile
witnesses
to
show
explicit
agreement.
i
would
suggest
that
on
these
facts,
the
court
has
never
had
a
sharper
case
in
which
there
was
evidence
at
least
requiring
ads.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
justice
fortas
that
this
--
the
circuit
court
here,
the
district
of
columbia
found
that
on
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
respondents
were
participants
in
the
plan
on
the
conspiracy,
that
circuit
court
here
found
that
there
were
disputed
issues
of
facts
which
would
require
resolution
by
trial.
it's
very
interesting
in
that
respect.
the
circuit
court
disagreed
with
the
respondents
on
their
major
thrust
to
the
argument.
the
main
thrust
of
the
argument
of
the
respondents
below
was
they
had
an
alternative
position,
a)
that
we
had
not
put
forward
a
serious
claim
that
these
respondents
as
justice
fortas
asked
the
question
were
participants
in
the
conspiracy.
that
was
their
main
argument.
and
summary
judgment
should
be
granted.
they
had
an
alternative
argument
that
even
if
they
were
participants
in
the
conspiracy,
even
if
they
had
participated
in
the
illegal
police
seizures
and
raids,
nevertheless
the
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity
protected
them.
it
was
an
alternative
argument.
now,
in
the
court
below,
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
what
is
so
interesting
here,
the
posture
of
the
case
now
before
this
court
is
that
the
court
below
rejected
their
main
contention
and
said,
“were
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case?
then
we
would
be
constraint
to
have
great
difficulty
to
find
that
there
were
not
disputed
issues
of
facts
upon
involving
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
which
would
require
exploration
by
a
trial.”
so
that
the
respondents
are
here
before
this
court
in
effect
asking
this
court
to
reject
the
conclusion
of
the
lower
court
that
as
to
the
court
and
justice
fortas
asked,
there
are
sufficient
disputed
issues
to
require
retrial.
now,
if
i
can
give
another
example
justice
fortas
which
led
the
district
--
the
circuit
court
to
the
conclusion
that
there
had
to
be
a
trial
to
resolve
these
issues.
take
the
formulations
in
the
general
motors
case,
not
only
in
respect
to
the
initiation
of
the
conspiracy
in
respect
to
its
execution.
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
more
than
adequate
evidence
here
to
show
the
joint
collaboration
of
the
co-conspirators
to
execute
it.now,
what
does
this
record
show?
it
shows
the
most
extraordinary
maneuver
which
took
place
on
october
4th
in
new
orleans.
in
24
hours,
the
following
things
happened.
as
a
result
of
the
plan,
operation
cheap
talk,
as
a
result
of
the
plan
to
use
police
machinery
to
seize
these
records,
the
police
came
in
and
as
this
court
knows
in
dombrowski,
pfister
where
the
description
of
the
raids
are
set
forth,
grabbed
all
of
the
records,
everything
in
the
offices
of
the
organization
and
mr.
smith
is
watching
the
lawyers.
now,
by
the
police
doing
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i'm
sorry
justice
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh!
the
records
of
mr.
smith
and
mr.
waltzer,
the
attorney
in
the
dombrowski,
pfister
who
were
also
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
--
they're
on
that
party
during
this
action.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes
chief
justice?
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly,
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
--
i
apologize.
i
apologize.
now,
the
immediate
effect
of
the
police
seizures
was
to
deprive
the
civil
rights
organization
of
any
opportunity
to
defend
against
a
legislative
subpoena
of
these
records
by
doing
the
conventional
thing
of
coming
in
to
quash
the
subpoena.
they
couldn't
do
it
because
the
police
grabbed
it
immediately.
but
then
look
what
happened.
instantaneously,
the
records
were
then
turned
over
to
the
louisiana
committee
with
the
subpoena
all
prepared
for
forthwith
production
of
everything
seized
and
then
that
night,
the
record
shows,
and
this
i
think
justice
fortas
goes
to
your
question
again.
that
night,
the
record
shows
that
rogers
got
on
the
telephone
to
sourwine,
said,
“alright,
we've
got
the
records,
come
on
down
to
louisiana.”
the
next
morning,
sourwine
arrives
in
louisiana
with
blank
subpoenas
signed
by
the
chairman
but
completely
in
blank.
subpoenas
incidentally
as
the
argument
will
later
show,
totally
unauthorized
by
the
senate
committee
itself
and
these
subpoenas
are
then
copied
verbatim
from
the
louisiana
subpoena
which
in
turn
was
copied
verbatim
from
the
warrant
of
arrest
later
declared
of
course
totally
illegal
and
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment,
in
other
words,
they
wrote
out
general
warrants,
warrants
of
assistance
right
then
and
there.
now
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i'm
sorry.
rogers
was
the
counsel
to
the
louisiana
legislative
committee.
i
asked
the
court
to
consider
what
happened
in
that
24
hours.
on
the
one
hand,
the
organization
and
the
plaintiffs
were
deprived
of
the
right,
the
ability
to
defend
against
the
legislative
subpoena.
at
the
end
of
the
24
hours,
they
were
deprived
of
their
opportunity
to
use
the
criminal
processes
to
go
in
and
move
to
quash
and
vacate
the
warrant
and
to
ask
for
a
return
of
the
books
and
records
because
at
the
end
of
the
24
hours
from
the
police
they
were
then
in
the
hands
of
a
legislative
committee
and
that
is
in
effect
what
happened
because
incidentally
this
was
all
secret.
nobody
knew
anything
about
this.
it
all
came
out
two
weeks
later,
when
we
went
into
the
louisiana
state
court
and
we
moved
to
vacate
the
warrants
of
arrest
and
this
motion
was
granted.
the
grant
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
we
then
got
up
and
we
said,
alright,
we
ask
the
state
court
to
order
that
the
books
and
records
and
membership
lists
be
returned
to
the
organization.
at
that
moment,
for
the
first
time,
we
learned
about
this
24-hour
maneuver.
because
at
that
moment
the
state
officials
got
up
and
said,
“we're
very
sorry,
we
cannot
return
these
books
and
records
because
they
are,
although
physically
here
in
louisiana,
they
are
in
the
custody
of
senator
eastland,
and
we
cannot
return
them.”
the
state
court
said,
“i'm
sorry,
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.”
and
the
books
and
records
were
not
returned.
then
the
third
phase
of
the
conspiracy
unquoted.
that
was
the
first
time
anybody,
ourselves
or
the
pubic,
knew
about
the
activities
of
these
respondents.
it's
very
significant
i
think
that
it
was
a
secret.
normally,
a
senate
committee
when
it
subpoenaed
something,
normally,
it's
in
the
newspapers,
they'll
issue
a
press
release,
this
was
very
secret.
we
didn't
know
about
it
until
that
state
court.
so
what
did
we
do?
we
then
went
into
the
federal
district
court
that
was
on
friday,
the
state
decision
came
down
saturday.
we
went
into
the
federal
district
court.
we
instituted
the
first
what
i
would
call,
the
louisiana
branch
of
this
litigation.
we
instituted
an
action
identical
to
this
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana
asking
for
damages,
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
and
for
the
return
of
the
books
and
records
injunctive
relief.
saturday,
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
court.
sunday
morning,
we
appeared
before
federal
district
judge
then
federal
district
judge
ainsworth
and
ask
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
issue
against
the
turning
over
of
these
records
physically
because
they
were
still
in
the
state
of
louisiana
to
these
respondents.
the
judge
then
asked
the
louisiana
officials
who
were
in
that
court,
“can
i
have
your
assurances
that
these
records
are
in
louisiana?”
and
they
said,
“yes,
they're
in
baton
rouge.”
mr.
arthur
kinoy
all
in
the
record
they
come
out
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
sourwine
and
affidavits
and
i
believe
they
are
uncontested.
at
that
point,
the
judge
told
us,
“send
a
telegram
to
the
respondents
including
senator
eastland.”
a
telegram
which
says,
“i'm
sending
down
this
tro
for
a
hearing
tomorrow
morning,
monday
morning.
and
the
tro
will
involve
an
injunction
to
restrain
turning
these
records
claimed
to
be
illegally
seized
over
to
you
and
i
request
your
presence.”
the
telegram
went
to
senator
eastland
that
in
sourwine's
testimony.
that
was
sunday.
at
10
o'clock
sunday
night,
senator
eastland,
respondent
here,
got
that
telegram.
he
then
got
on
the
telephone
to
respondent
sourwine
and
these
are
sourwine's
words,
not
ours.
senator
eastland
then
told
sourwine,
“get
those
records
out
of
louisiana.”
sourwine
protested,
“it
was
hard
to
do
it
that
night.”
he
said,
“well,
take
them
across
the
state
line
to
mississippi,
to
woodville,
mississippi.”
sourwine
then
called
one
of
the
louisiana
state
officials
also
a
co-defe
--
codefendant
in
the
actions
and
said,
“get
those
records
out
of
louisiana.”
at
12
o'clock
that
night,
a
van
arrived
in
baton
rouge,
took
all
of
the
records,
membership
lists
and
everything
else
out
of
louisiana
across,
i
think
the
court
can
take
notice
that
woodville,
mississippi
is
across
the
state
boundary,
took
those
records
into
woodville,
mississippi.
the
next
morning
we
appeared
in
federal
judge
ainsworth's
courtroom
in
response
to
the
tro.
and
when
the
judge
called
the
matter
to
be
heard,
the
state
officials
got
up
and
said,
“we're
very
sorry
your
honor,
the
books
and
records
are
no
longer
in
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
they
are
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
of
louisiana,”
where
i
ask
this
court
what
possible
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
that
conduct?
surely
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
are
entitled
to
draw
on
inference
of
a)
guilty
knowledge
on
the
part
of
these
respondents,
that
the
books
and
records
were
illegally
seized.
surely,
we
are
entitled
to
draw
an
inference
that
in
addition
to
that,
these
respondents
were
attempting
to
pursue
the
objectives
of
the
conspiracy.
i
would
suggest
that
short
of
actual
confessions
in
the
record,
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
further
evidence
which
would
--
would
require
to
withstand
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
now,
there
has
never
been
an
explanation
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
of
that
sunday
evening.
one
explanation
sourwine
suggested
on
his
deposition
that
the
federal
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
anyway.
well,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
don't
have
to
explore
very
fully
that
response,
perfectly
easy
for
an
attorney
to
go
into
the
federal
district
judge's
chambers
the
next
morning
and
say
“your
honor,
you
can
issue
any
temporary
restraining
order
but
you
have
no
jurisdiction.”
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
the
real
motivations
emerged
from
respondents
sourwine,
the
admission
in
the
testimony
that
he
did
it
because
he
thought
and
these
were
his
words,
he
would
be
in
an
awkward
situation,
if
the
records
were
not
removed.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
was
more
than
--
that
this
was
the
reason
why
the
district
court
--
the
circuit
court
below
rejected
out
of
their
hand
the
respondent's
contention
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
trial
and
the
issue
with
their
participation
of
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
district
of
columbia
court
below.
now,
the
thing
that
is
so
interesting
if
i
can
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
in
this
court
the
respondents
now
shifting
their
positions.
once
again
they
are
arguing
to
the
court
without
explaining
that
they
have
to
persuade
the
court
to
push
aside
the
conclusions
of
the
circuit
below.
once
again,
they
come
here
and
they
argue
that
summary
judgment
was
proper
there
was
no
evidence
to
go
to
it.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
right,
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
luncheon
recess,
i
had
remarked
that
in
this
court,
the
respondents
have
seem
to
shift
the
main
thrust
of
their
position
back
to
in
effect
urging
the
court
to
reject
the
conclusion
on
the
factual
record
of
the
lower
court.
now,
this
shift
may
in
certain
respects
be
due
to
the
intervening
impact
of
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
parallel
louisiana
litigation
which
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
may
throw
considerable
light
on
the
problems
presented
in
this
case.
in
that
parallel
litigation
instituted
in
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana,
defendant
pfister
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
un-american
activities
committee
of
the
louisiana
legislature
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
--
in
an
identical
complaint,
on
the
ground
that
he
was
protected
by
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity.
judge
ainsworth
rejected
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
disputed
fact
as
to
pfister's
participation
in
the
plan
and
the
raids,
that
these
disputed
fact
as
to
its
participation
in
the
raids,
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
judge
ainsworth
said,
his
activity,
which
he
is
charged
in
the
complaint,
was
legitimate
legislative
activity
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
tenney-brandhove.
then
a
very
curious
thing
happened.
pfister
interpleaded
as
third
party
defendants,
all
of
the
members
of
the
louisiana
legislative
committee
saying
that
he
was
responsible,
so
were
they.
they
came
in
before
judge
ainsworth.
they
move
to
for
summary
judgment
also
on
the
ground
they
were
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity.
judge
ainsworth
granted
their
motions.
pfister
then
appealed
that
decision
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
this
november,
november
1966,
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
circuit
judge
wisdom,
reversed
the
granting
of
summary
judgment
as
to
the
members
of
the
legislative
committee
in
an
opinion
which
i
would
suggest
puts
its
finger
upon
the
conceptual
confusion
which
i
think
is
present
in
the
circuit
court's
opinion
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
case.
judge
wisdom
pointed
out
in
arceneaux
against
pfister,
we
have
included
for
the
court's
convenience
judge
wisdom's
written
opinion
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
judge
wisdom
made
the
following
analysis,
and
he
said,
“there
are
disputed
issues
of
facts
as
to
whether
these
third
party
defendants
had
any
knowledge
of
the
plan
to
use
police
raids,
or
participated
in
any
way
in
the
planning
and
initiation
and
carrying
out
of
this
conspiracy.
there
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
as
to
that.”
that
in
turn,
judge
wisdom
pointed
out,
not
only
precludes
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
to
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
but
precludes
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
to
their
defense
of
legislative
immunity.
because
judge
wisdom
then
pointed
out
that
the
issue
of
their
participation
in
the
conspiracy
undisputed
issue
raises
he
said
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
legitimate
legislative
activity
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
tenney
and
to
drive
this
point
home,
judge
wisdom
italicized
in
the
opinion
the
word
‘legitimate'
in
the
quotation
from
the
court's
opinion
in
tenney.
accordingly,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
ordered
that
these
defendants
also
must
stand
trial.
now,
what
is
the
situation
therefore
in
the
parallel
louisiana
litigation?
these
cases
are
on
the
ready-jury
calendar.
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
cases
must
go
to
trial,
judge
ainsworth
granted
a
permissive
appeal
to
pfister
from
the
denial
of
his
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
appeal.
all
of
the
louisiana
officials
including
the
legislative
officials
will
stand
trial
in
federal
district
court
in
louisiana,
in
the
cases
on
the
ready-jury
calendar.
now
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
no
judge
stewart.
no,
they
are
in
the
case.
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
granted
by
the
district
court
has
been
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
right.
they
are
impleaded
now
justice
stewart.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
they
are
defendants
and
they
will
stand
trial.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
but
all
the
other
police
officials
are
in.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
police
officials,
the
staff
director
of
the
louisiana
committee,
alexander,
and
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
rogers
was
never
joined
as
a
defendant.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
they
were
named
but
they
were
not
served.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
couldn't
serve
them
until
we
reached
them
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
they
have.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
and
not
served.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
identical
to
that
case.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
exactly
right
and
they
will
stand
trial
there.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
analysis
of
judge
wisdom
in
the
arceneaux
case
places
a
spotlight
on
the
problem
before
this
court
because
in
essence
what
the
court
faces
here
is
the
sharp
fact
that
the
conduct
charged
to
these
respondents
in
the
participation
in
the
illegal
raid
and
seizure,
and
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
deemed
to
be
if
in
fact
they
participated
in
this
a
legitimate
legislative
activity
protected
by
the
scope
of
this
featured
debate
clause.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh!
justice
fortas,
no,
i
would
make
no
distinction
because
for
the
purposes
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
neither
of
the
two
phases
which
you
described
would
be
sufficient
to
invoke
the
doctrine.
the
respondents
suggest
that
the
latter
phase,
the
use
of
the
unauthorized
subpoena
in
some
way
is
sufficient
to
invoke
the
doctrine.
my
suggestion
to
that
is
that
the
short
answer
to
that
is
kilbourn-thompson,
and
every
subsequent
decision
of
this
court
on
the
immunity
question.
in
kilbourn
which
this
court
in
the
gojack
decision
just
last
term,
so
a
reason
to
describe
as
the
leading
case
on
the
subject,
in
kilbourn,
the
warrant
of
arrest
did
not
serve
to
immunize
the
sergeant
at
arms
from
tort
liability
for
the
wrongful
arrest.
similarly
here,
the
subpoenas
are
insufficient
to
immunize
the
respondents
from
tort
liability
for
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
for
several
reasons.
first,
a
search
and
seizure
itself,
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
as
the
court
described
in
the
stanford
case,
the
same
term
that
dombrowski-pfister
was
decided,
search
and
seizure
of
this
nature,
stanford
very
interesting
case
because
it
involved
a
raid
identical
to
this
raid,
a
raid
under
the
anti-subversive
laws
of
texas.
and
this
court
described
that
raid,
the
same
thing
happened,
they
took
all
the
books
and
records,
everything
from
the
office.
the
court
described
this
raid
as
a
constitutionally
impermissible
act.
now,
if
this
kind
of
a
raid
on
a
general
warrant,
is
a
constitutionally
impermissible
act,
it
is
no
less
or
constitutionally
impermissible.
it's
in
the
same
caliber
as
the
warrant
of
arrest
in
kilbourn
which
the
court
said
was
not
sufficient
to
immunize
the
sergeant
in
kilbourn-thompson
from
a
suit
for
damages.
now,
secondly,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
subpoenas
issued
in
blank
were
themselves
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
that
is
the
problem
which
the
respondents
have
not
coped
with
because
the
incredible
aspect
of
the
record
is
that
these
subpoenas
in
blank
which
were
filled
out
that
morning
in
baton
rouge
were
copied
identically
from
the
state
subpoena
which
was
based
upon
the
criminal
warrant.
these
were
stricken
and
the
court
remarked
in
dombrowski-pfister,
these
were
stricken
as
illegal,
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
they
were
like
the
warrants
in
stanford.
they
were
what
the
court
in
stanford
called
absolutely
identical
to
general
warrants,
the
writs
of
assistance.
now
it,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
is
impossible
to
assert
that
the
use
of
a
general
warrant
or
a
writ
of
assistance
is
legitimate
legislative
activity
in
any
sense
of
the
work
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
stanford,
not
since
the
statement
of
james
otis
in
the
revolutionary
period.
has
any
court
in
this
country
has
any
legislative
body
ever
suggested
that
the
use
of
a
general
warrant,
a
writ
of
assistance
could
conceivably
be
considered
legitimate
legislative
activity.
now,
thirdly,
the
blank
subpoenas
which
incidentally
now
are
the
only
shred
these
respondents
hold
to
on
adoption
of
legislative
immunity
here.
they
don't
assert
as
they
did
below
that
if
they
really
participated
in
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
that
they
initiated,
planned
or
helped
it
along
as
we
discussed
earlier
this
morning,
they
don't
really
assert
that
adoption
of
legislative
immunity
could
protect
that.
that's
difficult
to
assert.
the
only
shred
of
holding
to
the
doctrine
is
the
use
of
this
subpoena.
but
the
subpoena
itself
not
only
is
illegal,
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
the
writ
of
assistance
but
was
totally
unauthorized
by
the
committee
itself.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
and
i
address
myself
only
to
this
justice
stewart
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
featured
debate
clause
problem.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
and
in
that
respect,
in
addition
to
the
illegality
of
the
subpoena
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
respondents
here
concede
in
their
brief
that
this
subpoena
issued
in
blank
and
then
filled
out
in
baton
rouge
was
wholly
unauthorized
by
the
senate
subcommittee.
however,
the
respondents
say
this
is
a
minor
technical
question.
this
is
a
question
which
can
be
cured,
would
later
cure.
i
would
suggest
that
the
suggestion
that
the
unauthorized
use
of
a
subpoena
in
the
area
of
investigation
into
the
rights
of
citizens
under
the
first
amendment
is
no
minor
technical
matter.
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
watkins,
to
the
decisions
last
term
in
gojack,
it
seems
clear
that
the
court
has
said
that
as
a
minimum,
as
a
minimal
out
of
boundary
of
legislative
power
in
the
area
of
the
use
of
compulsory
process
to
investigate
into
activities
associations
of
citizen
within
the
framework
of
the
first
amendment
as
an
outer
minimal
boundary,
the
court
has
directed
the
concept
of
the
requirements
of
authorization
for
such
legislative
activity.
now,
this
is
no
minor
technical
question.
in
watkins,
this
court
said,
that
that
requirements
of
authorization
went
to
the
heart
of
the
preservation
of
limited
constitutional
government
that
at
a
minimum
putting
aside
the
impact
of
an
authorized
subpoena
upon
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right
that
at
the
minimum
the
exerci
--
the
use
of
the
requirement
of
authorization
chartered
the
out
of
boundaries,
the
outer
boundaries
of
legislative
power.
it
would
seem
therefore
that
far
from
being
a
technical
question,
the
use
of
a
subpoena
is
so
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
self-written
as
a
general
writ
of
assistance
and
itself
not
authorized
by
the
senate
subcommittee
could
never
be
conceived
of
as
legitimate
legislative
activity
within
the
meaning
of
this
featured
debate
clause.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
was.
it
was
submitted
as
such.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
it
could.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
the
record
show
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
was
not
filled
in.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
about
three
months
later,
yes.
two
months
later,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
now,
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
doesn't
cure.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
under
gojack
and
on
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
would
point
out
justice
fortas
also
that
in
the
examination
of
the
resolution
of
the
senate
committee
there
is
some
question
even
about
that
which
we
were
not
permitted
to
fully
litigate
in
the
district
court.
senator
keating
raised
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
ratification
actually
took
place
and
that
sort
to
take
the
deposition
of
senator
keating
but
i
could
not
get
an
adjournment
in
trying
to
take
that,
but
putting
aside
that,
in
the
examination
of
the
resolution
itself,
very
interesting
because
the
resolution
does
not
specifically
say
that
we
authorize
the
issuance
of
that
subpoena
or
we
think
that
subpoena
was
properly
authorized.
all
the
resolution
says
that
these
documents
which
we
now
have
here
can
be
put
in
our
record.
and
after
they
put
in
our
record,
they
should
be
sent
back
to
new
orleans.
so
i
would
suggest
that
even
on
that
level
there
was
no
direct
authorization
but
i
do
not
rest
on
that,
because
i
think
it
--
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
why
authorization
is
so
critically
required
in
this
entire
area.
now,
i
would
suggest
then
that
any
effort
to
invoke
the
legislative
immunity
doctrine
here
runs
in
the
face
of
this
court's
own
definitions
from
kilbourn
to
united
stated
against
johnson
itself
as
to
the
limits
which
must
be
fenced
around
the
privilege.
i
find
it
helpful
for
example,
the
opinion
of
the
english
courts
in
stockdale-hansard
which
this
court
in
kilbourn
said
represented
the
basis
of
the
thinking
that
went
into
the
immunity
concept
itself,
to
the
clause
itself.
and
in
stockdale,
the
court
will
recall,
the
english
court
felt
that
it
was
essential
if
the
liberties
of
citizens
are
to
be
protected
if
the
double
pole
which
is
exercised
in
the
emergence
of
the
immunity,
one
pole
toward
the
independence
and
free
speech
of
the
legislature,
the
other
pole
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
citizens
to
exercise
fundamental
liberties
and
to
be
protected
by
a
remedy
in
the
court
of
law
against
infringement
of
those
liberties.
if
those
two
poles
are
to
be
reconciled
and
they
must
be,
said
the
court
in
stockdale
and
this
court
in
kilbourn,
then
we
must
as
the
english
court
said,
we
must
fence
in
the
privilege
by
the
law.
that
is
our
responsibility.
we
must
fence
in
the
privilege
by
the
law.
and
the
court
did
that
in
kilbourn.
and
the
court
said
that
the
illegal
act
of
arrest
does
not
protect
the
sergeant
of
arms
and
a
money
judgment
will
lie
and
was
later,
actually
collected
against
the
sergeant
of
arms.
secondly,
the
court,
justice
miller
said
in
kilbourn,
if
the
members
of
the
congress
themselves
had
participated
in
the
arrest
in
anyway,
he
says,
they
would
be
liable
as
the
sergeant
of
arms.
they
are
protected
for
what?
only
the
pure
legislative
act,
the
passage
of
the
resolution
authorized,
that
alone
says
the
justice
in
kilbourn
would
protect
them.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
i'm
not
arguing
that
justice
fortas
and
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
or
reach
that
in
this
situation,
not
at
all.
i
think
--
i
would
suggest
that
the
definition
in
tenney
based
upon
the
definition
in
kilbourn
is
sufficient
here
that
where
the
act
is
not
an
act
traditionally
within
the
power
of
the
legislative
--
legitimate
legislative
activity
where
it
is
as
in
kilbourn,
an
unlawful
illegal
arrest
where
it
is
as
here
in
dombrowski,
eastland,
an
unlawful
search
or
seizure.
then
clearly
that
is
the
line,
that
is
where
the
law
offenses
in
the
immunity.
and
at
that
point,
the
courts
of
law
are
obligated
to
provide
the
remedy
to
protect
the
citizen.
and
at
that
point
the
legislative
immunity
is
found
at
all.
now,
some
suggestions
has
been
made
that
if
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
involvement
with
the
state
officials,
justice
white,
goes
to
the
availability
of
the
civil
rights
act
course
of
action
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
yes.
i
would
have
it
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
correct.
that's
correct
justice
white.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
remedy
is
offered
for
on
the
color
of
state
law
and
that
is
available,
i
would
suggest,
in
this
situation.
but
as
far
as
the
basic
thrust
of
the
illegality
is
concerned,
the
illegality
stands
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
participation
by
the
state
officials.
yes,
i
would
suggest
that
justice
white.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
made
by
the
respondents
that
perhaps
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
bar,
the
official
immunity
doctrine
might
conceivably
be
available
perhaps
to
respondent
sourwine.
i
don't
want
to
spend
very
much
time
on
that
except
to
point
out
that
from,
that
the
doctrine
and
concept
which
this
court
developed
in
bar,
a
judicially
constructed
doctrine
grounded
on
the
principles
and
concepts
of
the
common
law,
points
an
answer
to
this
problem
in
the
common
law
because
in
the
classic
case
involving
remedies
for
searches
and
seizures,
entick
against
carrington,
the
english
court
not
only
found
for
the
plaintiff
on
an
action
but
permitted
damages
against
his
majesty,
secretary
of
state,
an
order
that
damages
issue.
why?
because
the
english
court
in
entick
said
in
carrington
that
the
interest
in
preserving
the
fundamental
liberties
of
the
citizen,
the
subject
in
that
case
is
such
a
deep-seated
requirement
that
a
remedy
and
damages
far
from
interfering
with
the
operations
of
government
is
essential
if
government
is
going
to
what?
is
going
to
view
two
constitutional
lines.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
recent
decisions
of
the
circuit
courts,
three
of
the
circuits
have
refused
to
apply
any
doctrine
or
concept
of
immunity
to
the
charge
of
participation
in
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
this
is
too
fundamental
over
a
question.
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
functioning
of
government
itself
within
the
framework
of
constitutional
law.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
in
dombrowski-pfister,
before
the
court
two
terms
ago.
the
issues
here
transcend
the
immediate
question
here
presented
as
compelling
as
they
are
for
relief.
and
as
in
dombrowski-pfister
the
problem
is
here
posed
as
to
whether
this
court
will
say
that
under
this
system
of
ordered
law,
a
remedy
exists
for
the
protection
of
fundamental
liberties
of
the
people
and
that
this
remedy
will
be
available
and
that
lawless
activity
of
individuals
regardless
of
their
station
in
society
are
subject
to
the
processes
of
the
law
and
that
the
law
stands
ready
to
provide
this
relief.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
within
this
concept,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
these
respondents
should
be
required
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
presented
in
this
complaint.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
don't
think
a
definitive
ruling
is
possible
justice
harlan
without
a
development
of
fact
and
i
think
that
that's
exactly
what
justice
wis
--
judge
wisdom
was
getting
at.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's'
right.
i
think
that
a
full
development
of
facts
is
required
here
and
that
therefore
this
should
be
sent
back
for
a
trial
on
the
facts.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
57.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
a
few
remarks
to
make
in
rebuttal.
i
think
the
issue
is
a
rather
fully
and
complete
before
the
court.
just
on
a
factual
question,
the
court
addressed
the
question
as
to
whether
the
telegram
to
the
senator
was
on
the
directions
of
the
judge
and
the
transcript
on
page
29
has
a
affidavit
which
says,
“on
instructions
from
judge
ainsworth
to
notify
the
other
parties
to
be
present
in
his
office
at
9:00
am
on
the
morning
of
monday,
october
28,
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
the
request
for
temporary
restraining
order.
telegrams
were
sent
to
all
of
defendants,
green,
burbank
and
willie.”
that's
in
--
on
page
29
of
the
record.
the
telegram
was
sent
at
the
instructions
of
judge
ainsworth.
that
affidavit
has
never
been
controverted.
i
just
have
one
or
two
other
remarks
that
i
would
like
to
make.
a
suggestion
has
been
made
that
perhaps
in
some
way,
the
doctrines
developed
by
this
court
in
barr,
the
immunity
doctrines,
may
save
the
respondents
here.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
as
was
mentioned
by
the
court,
the
question
in
barr
was
of
course
tort
and
liability
on
defamation.
there
was
no
intimation
in
barr
to
the
slightest
degree
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
or
in
the
dissenting
opinions
that
the
court
would
have
take
the
same
view
toward
a
charge
of
participation
in
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
the
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
barr
is
very
clear
that
what
the
court
is
there
talking
about
are
acts,
normal
ordinary
business
acts
in
the
course
of
the
conduct
of
the
government
business
and
i
don't
think
the
court
in
the
majority
of
dissent
in
barr
would
have
ever
intimated
that
the
participation
in
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
would
be
the
kind
of
activity
which
would
invoke
under
any
circumstances
a
man
told
of
immunity
under
barr
and
it's
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
i
would
think
that
if
mr.
robb
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
right.
i
think
--
i
--
in
any
event
from
their
arguments,
i
think
the
respondents
have
been
asserting
that
concept
but
even
if
mr.
robb
does
concede
that,
i
would
say
then
clearly
that
the
issue
there
is
one
of
whether
or
not
the
acts
here
presents
a
contested
issue
of
facts
as
to
participation
in
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
or
the
fruits
of
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
now,
in
that
respect,
i
don't
think
that
the
respondents
here
have
responded
--
have
answered
to
the
simple
proposition
brought
forth
by
the
court
in
kilbourn,
because
kilbourn
is
quite
clear
that
the
use
of
the
warrant
of
arrest
by
the
sergeant
was
no
protection
in
immunity
to
tort
liability.
i
think
the
analogy
is
very
clear
here
for
the
warrant
of
arrest
and
to
the
subpoena.
now,
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
as
i
listened
to
the
argument
of
mr.
robb,
there
would
seem
to
be
no
direct
reputation
of
the
simple
record
fact
that
the
respondents
here
at
a
minimum
engaged
in
activity
taking
the
records
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
louisiana
knowing
that
these
were
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
about
that.
the
louisiana
court
has
so
ruled
in
which
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
they
were
illegally
seized
fruits
of
a
search
and
seizure.
i
would
suggest
on
two
scores,
one,
that
it's
black
letter
conspiracy
law.
that
fact
showing
the
participation
in
the
fruits
of
the
conspiracy
are
certainly
admissible
to
show
the
co-conspirators'
knowledge
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
participation
in
the
conspiracy
and
the
second,
this
black
letter
law
in
respect
to
the
laws
of
the
fourth
amendments,
that
the
participation
in
the
fruits
of
the
illegal
search
and
seizures
are
unconstitutionally
void
as
the
seizure
itself.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
on
friday.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
in
friday
of
our
--
of
the
--
the
removal
was
on
sunday.
the
state
court
decision
was
on
friday
vacating
these
warrants
of
arrests.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
sunday
morning
when
he
directed
a
telegram
and
monday
morning
before
on
the
tro,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
i
--
i
think,
that's
argued
in
full
in
the
brief
with
just
a
word
on
that
justice
stewart
since
you
raised
the
question.
i
think
that
the
argument
of
the
respondents
make
it
very
clear
why
the
equitable
course
of
action
was
essential.
we
ask
simply
for
an
injunction
ordering
the
return
of
the
illegally
seized
records
and
that
copy
should
not
be
used.
we
asked
for
that
in
the
district
court
here
in
washington.
in
the
district
court
in
washington,
we
were
told
by
the
respondents
and
the
courts
that
we
had
--
there
was
no
power,
no
jurisdiction
or
power
in
the
district
court
to
restrain
a
congressional
committee.
the
circuit
court
did
not
follow
that
approach
because
we
were
asking
for
an
injunctive
relief
against
the
individual
respondents.
they
concede
it
that
an
injunction
would
lie
against
the
individual
respondents
but
they
said
it
would
be
futile
to
give
us
that
remedy
because
unilaterally
the
individual
respondents
had
said
that
they
had
no
copies
of
the
documents
and
records
but
it
was
in
the
senate
committee.
this
was
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
justice
stewart.
that's
--
that's
the
heart
of
the
matter
on
the
equitable
relief.
that
fact
was
totally
disputed.
we
don't
know.
mr.
robb
was
unable
to
answer
the
question
as
to
how
many
copies
of
the
record
there
are.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
don't
know.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
justice
stewart,
we
had
no
opportunity
contradicting
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
there
are
statements
that
those
were
the
only
records,
yes
justice
stewart.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
under
oath.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
controvert
those
because
the
district
court
on
the
request
for
tro
dismissed
the
equitable
complaint
not
on
this
factual
issue
but
that
he
had
no
power.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
and
our
position
simply
on
that
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no,
we
don't
make
issue.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
we
say
we
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
question.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
an
alternative
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
an
alternative
argument
and
a
subsidiary
argument.
third,
i
would
say
justice
brennan
that
we
argue
that
this
is
additional
evidence
which
would
be
admissible
on
the
original
conspiracy.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
it
would
seem
so,your
honor,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
seizures
were
on
october
4.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
on
the
24th
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
24th
of
october,
the
arrest
warrants
request,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
the
subpoenas
were
dated
october
4th,
the
same
time.
there
is
some
conflict
--
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
the
state
of
court
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
subsequent
and
the
action
of
the
respondents
removing
them
from
the
jurisdiction
were
after
the
action
of
the
louisiana
court.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that
was
the
27th.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right,
justice
white.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes.
i
would
argue
that
also.
i
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
that
but
i
would
argue,
yes.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
that's
right
your
honor,
about
the
removal
from
one
place
to
another
i
think
adds
great
inference
and
weight
to
the
conclusions.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
thank
you.
