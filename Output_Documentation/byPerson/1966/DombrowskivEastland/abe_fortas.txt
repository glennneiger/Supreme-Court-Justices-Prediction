justice
abe
fortas
what
does
the
complaint
say
alleged
that
the
two
defendants
did?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
all
i
saw
in
your
complaint
was
sort
of
a
conclusory
allegation
as
distinguished
from
the
allegation
about
other
people
with
respect
to
these
defendants.
i
didn't
see
anything.
i
don't
remember
anything
except
the
allegation
in
paragraph
12
which
appears
on
page
4.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
that
they
entered
into
a
planned
agreement
in
conspiracy
to
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
their
rights,
privileges
and
immunities.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
as
to
the
beginning
of
the
conspiracy,
the
alleged
conspiracy,
the
illegal
seizure
of
documents
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
only
allegation
that
you
don't
make
any
specific
allegation
with
respect
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
was
--
what
was
that
as
you
understand
it?
what
was
their
participation
in
the
initiation?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
were
these
--
were
these
defendants
involved
in
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
if
allowed
to
go
to
trial,
you'll
be
able
to
prove
that
the
defendant,
sourwine
at
that
conference
participated
in
a
plan
to
use
the
police
power
and
search
warrants
rather
than
subpoenas?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kinoy
there
--
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
there
are
two
factual
situations
here
and
i
wonder
if
you
make
a
distinction
between
them.
first
is
the
alleged
participation
in
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
the
second
is
the
alleged
unlawful
improper
or
whatever,
how
do
you
style
it,
action
with
respect
to
the
picking
of
the
documents
while
a
proceeding
was
pending
in
the
court
of
judge
ainsworth.
now,
my
question
to
you
is
whether
for
purposes
of
the
legislative
immunity
problem,
you
make
a
distinction
between
those
two.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
i
correctly
recall
the
facts
on
which
is
the
last
argument
is
based.
is
it
your
submission
that
the
subpoena
was
issued
in
blank?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why,
isn't
that
the
issuance
have
been
authorized
by
senator
eastland?
justice
abe
fortas
then
senator
eastland
signed
it
as
chairman
of
the
committee.
justice
abe
fortas
while
it
was
not
filled
in,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
after
it
was
served
or
taken,
then
there
was
a
ratification
by
way
of
formal
resolution
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
resolution
of
the
committee
itself?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
--
your
contention
is
that
that
--
it
doesn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
moment
that
doesn't
say
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
arguing
are
you
mr.
kinoy
that
this
--
that
if
the
subpoena,
if
a
subpoena
is
issued
from
the
proper
authorization
and
if
it
is
defective
for
some
reason
other
than
authorization
that
legislative
immunity
would
not
apply.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robb,
excuse
me,
is
that
--
that
certain
--
that
certain
decision
final?
there's
been
no
petition
search
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robb,
excuse
me
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
page
5
of
the
brief
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
brief
signed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
you.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you've
got
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare,
a
communist
front
organization,
should
you
call
a
communist
front
organization,
is
that
ever
on
the
attorney
general's
list?
justice
abe
fortas
who
do
you
work?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
brief
is
not
suggesting
that
it
is
a
communist
front
organization
then.
justice
abe
fortas
but
was
there
any
offer
to
judge
ainsworth
to
deliver
the
records
of
this
said
order?
in
another
words,
as
i
understand
the
facts
here,
the
records
were
--
in
louisiana
in
the
possession,
physical
possession
of
the
state
officials.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
was
a
proceeding
on
the
way
of
judge
ainsworth's
courtroom.
and
he
had
issued
an
order
noticing
a
hearing
on
a
temporary
restraining
order
for
monday.
he
issued
the
order
on
friday
presumably,
friday?
and
then
some
time
in
that
weekend,
the
documents
were
taken
away
in
a
truck
over
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
across
the
state
line
and
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
judge
ainsworth's
court.
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
if
the
reason
for
this
kind
of
--
or
hopefully
unusual
action,
the
reason
for
this
unusual
action
was
to
clarify
the
issues
or
avoid
personal
embarrassment
of
some
other
general
purpose,
whether
any
statement
was
ever
made
to
judge
ainsworth
that
the
documents
would
be
returned
to
his
jurisdiction
and
made
available
to
be
disposed
of
as
he
might
order.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
tried
to
pursue
that
within
these
questions
very
well
with
mr.
kinoy.
as
i
understand,
his
answers
to
my
questions
they
are
asserting
this
course
of
action
for
two
independent
acts
and
that
is
to
say
for
the
unlawful
taking
of
the
record
by
the
senate
committee
or
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine.
they
are
asserting
that
that
was
unlawful
that
gives
rise
to
a
cross
reduction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
independently
of
the
other,
if
i
correctly
understood
you
justice
abe
fortas
i
can
stand
that
but
he
says
that,
â€œlet's
suppose
that
the
conspiracy
were
only
to
--
for
the
mr.
sourwine
and
senator
eastland
to
take
the
records
after
they
have
been
unlawfully
seized
by
the
louisiana
officers.
as
i
understood
mr.
kinoy's
response
to
my
questions,
i
maybe
wrong.
he
says
that
that
would
give
them
a
right
to
damages
and
foreign
injunction.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
his
contention
as
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
may
be
wrong
about
it
but
i
assume
--
that's
why
i
ask
him
the
question
and
that's
what
i
understood
his
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
what
they're
really
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
they're
really
saying
may
be,
if
i
understand
mr.
kinoy,
that
they're
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
to
see
whether
the
jury
will
infer
from
the
various
meetings
that
were
held
that
such
a
conspiracy
or
understanding
did
exist.
that
is
to
say
that
apart
from
any
specific
testimony
that
mr.
sourwine
and
the
louisiana
officials
agreed
that
they
would
undertake
this,
they
did
have
meetings
and
that
they're
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
and
see
whether
the
jury
will
infer
from
the
seeking
effect
of
the
meetings
and
the
sequence
of
events
that
there
was
this
conspiracy.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
do
you
make
up
a
quote
from
tenney
against
brandhove
on
page
38
of
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
suggests
a
difference
in
the
two?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
it
says
--
it
says
that
the
legislator
--
the
member
of
the
legislature
has
a
higher
type
of
quality
or
something
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
privilege
than
where
an
official
--
then
--
then
an
official
has
who
has
many
acumen
on
behalf
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
did
seem
a
little
trouble
here
i'm
afraid.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said,
i
think
that
leads
into
some
trouble
here.
i
understand
you
get
into
a
question
as
to
whether
their
official
get
preliminary
question
anyway
or
whether
the
employee
is
acting
merely
as
an
peripheral
ego
or
whether
he
has
aired
with
little
pepper
and
salt
and
wosterschire
sauce
and
ingredients
of
his
own.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
and
that
--
and
that
gets
you
into
a
problem
because
his
contention
is
that
the
--
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
took
over
appropriate
for
the
uses
of
this
committee
if
you
will,
papers
and
records
which
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
by
that
time,
i
suppose,
knew
had
been
held
to
be
unlawfully
seized,
is
there
--
by
that
--
by
the
time
of
it's
proceeding
before
judge
ainsworth
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
there
had
been
state
court
decision
saying
that
this
material
was
unlawfully
seized.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
my
recollection
so
that
in
--
in
terms
of
the
sequence
of
events,
if
i
understand
mr.
kinoy.
he
is
saying
that
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
deliberately
took
over
papers
and
documents
that
had
been
unlawfully
seized
and
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
that
and
the
--
the
service
of
an
--
a
direct
service
of
an
unlawful
--
that
directs
an
unlawful
seizure
of
documents?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
am
assuming
that
they
took
over
the
papers
though
after
their
administrative
adjudication.
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
raid
was
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand,
and
mr.
robb
contested
that.
i
didn't
understand
that
your
--
mr.
robb
contested
that
proposition.
justice
abe
fortas
i
may
be
wrong
but
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kinoy,
the
state
court
decision
holding
the
search
and
seizure
illegal
prior
to
the
proceedings
before
the
citation--
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
proceedings
before
judge
ainsworth
are
when?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
the
complaint
say
alleged
that
the
two
defendants
did?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
all
i
saw
in
your
complaint
was
sort
of
a
conclusory
allegation
as
distinguished
from
the
allegation
about
other
people
with
respect
to
these
defendants.
i
didn't
see
anything.
i
don't
remember
anything
except
the
allegation
in
paragraph
12
which
appears
on
page
4.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
that
they
entered
into
a
planned
agreement
in
conspiracy
to
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
their
rights,
privileges
and
immunities.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
as
to
the
beginning
of
the
conspiracy,
the
alleged
conspiracy,
the
illegal
seizure
of
documents
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
only
allegation
that
you
don't
make
any
specific
allegation
with
respect
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
was
--
what
was
that
as
you
understand
it?
what
was
their
participation
in
the
initiation?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
were
these
--
were
these
defendants
involved
in
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
if
allowed
to
go
to
trial,
you'll
be
able
to
prove
that
the
defendant,
sourwine
at
that
conference
participated
in
a
plan
to
use
the
police
power
and
search
warrants
rather
than
subpoenas?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kinoy
there
--
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
there
are
two
factual
situations
here
and
i
wonder
if
you
make
a
distinction
between
them.
first
is
the
alleged
participation
in
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
the
second
is
the
alleged
unlawful
improper
or
whatever,
how
do
you
style
it,
action
with
respect
to
the
picking
of
the
documents
while
a
proceeding
was
pending
in
the
court
of
judge
ainsworth.
now,
my
question
to
you
is
whether
for
purposes
of
the
legislative
immunity
problem,
you
make
a
distinction
between
those
two.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
i
correctly
recall
the
facts
on
which
is
the
last
argument
is
based.
is
it
your
submission
that
the
subpoena
was
issued
in
blank?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why,
isn't
that
the
issuance
have
been
authorized
by
senator
eastland?
justice
abe
fortas
then
senator
eastland
signed
it
as
chairman
of
the
committee.
justice
abe
fortas
while
it
was
not
filled
in,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
after
it
was
served
or
taken,
then
there
was
a
ratification
by
way
of

of

by
resolution
of

justice
abe

and
your
--
your
contention
is
that
that
--
it
doesn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
moment
that
doesn't
say
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
arguing
are
you
mr.
kinoy
that
this

that
if
the
subpoena,
if
a

is

from
the

and
if
it
is
defective
for
some
reason
other
than
authorization
that
legislative
immunity
would
not
apply.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robb,
excuse
me,
is
that
--
that
certain
--
that
certain
decision
final?
there's
been
no
petition
search
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robb,
excuse
me
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
page
5
of
the
brief
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
brief
signed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
you.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you've
got
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare,
a
communist
front
organization,
should
you
call
a
communist
front
organization,
is
that
ever
on
the
attorney

list?
justice
abe
fortas
who
do
you
work?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
brief
is
not
suggesting
that
it
is
a
communist
front
organization
then.
justice
abe
fortas
but
was
there
any
offer
to
judge
ainsworth
to
deliver
the
records
of
this
said
order?
in
another
words,
as
i
understand
the
facts
here,
the
records
were
--
in
louisiana
in
the
possession,
physical
possession
of
the
state
officials.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
was
a
proceeding
on
the
way
of
judge
ainsworth's
courtroom.
and
he
had
issued
an
order
noticing
a
hearing
on
a
temporary
restraining
order
for
monday.
he
issued
the
order
on
friday
presumably,
friday?
and
then
some
time
in
that
weekend,
the
documents
were
taken
away
in
a
truck
over
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
across
the
state
line
and
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
judge
ainsworth's
court.
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
if
the
reason
for
this
kind
of
--
or
hopefully
unusual
action,
the
reason
for
this
unusual
action
was
to
clarify
the
issues
or
avoid
personal
embarrassment
of
some
other
general
purpose,
whether
any
statement
was
ever
made
to
judge
ainsworth
that
the
documents
would
be
returned
to
his
jurisdiction
and
made
available
to
be
disposed
of
as
he
might
order.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
tried
to
pursue
that
within
these
questions
very
well
with
mr.
kinoy.
as
i
understand,
his
answers
to
my
questions
they
are
asserting
this
course
of
action
for
two
independent
acts
and
that
is
to
say
for
the
unlawful
taking
of
the
record
by
the
senate
committee
or
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine.
they
are
asserting
that
that
was
unlawful
that
gives
rise
to
a
cross
reduction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
independently
of
the
other,
if
i
correctly
understood
you
justice
abe
fortas
i
can
stand
that
but
he
says
that,
â€œlet's
suppose
that
the
conspiracy
were
only
to
--
for
the
mr.
sourwine
and
senator
eastland
to
take
the
records
after
they
have
been
unlawfully
seized
by
the
louisiana
officers.
as
i
understood
mr.
kinoy's
response
to
my
questions,
i
maybe
wrong.
he
says
that
that
would
give
them
a
right
to
damages
and
foreign
injunction.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
his
contention
as
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
may
be
wrong
about
it
but
i
assume
--
that's
why
i
ask
him
the
question
and
that's
what
i
understood
his
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
what
they're
really
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
they're
really
saying
may
be,
if
i
understand
mr.
kinoy,
that
they're
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
to
see
whether
the
jury
will
infer
from
the
various
meetings
that
were
held
that
such
a
conspiracy
or
understanding
did
exist.
that
is
to
say
that
apart
from
any
specific
testimony
that
mr.
sourwine
and
the
louisiana
officials
agreed
that
they
would
undertake
this,
they
did
have
meetings
and
that
they're
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
and
see
whether
the
jury
will
infer
from
the
seeking
effect
of
the
meetings
and
the
sequence
of
events
that
there
was
this
conspiracy.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
do
you
make
up
a
quote
from
tenney
against
brandhove
on
page
38
of
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
suggests
a
difference
in
the
two?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
it
says
--
it
says
that
the
legislator
--
the
member
of
the
legislature
has
a
higher
type
of
quality
or
something
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
privilege
than
where
an
official
--
then
--
then
an
official
has
who
has
many
acumen
on
behalf
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
did
seem
a
little
trouble
here
i'm
afraid.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said,
i
think
that
leads
into
some
trouble
here.
i
understand
you
get
into
a
question
as
to
whether
their
official
get
preliminary
question
anyway
or
whether
the
employee
is
acting
merely
as
an
peripheral
ego
or
whether
he
has
aired
with
little
pepper
and
salt
and
wosterschire
sauce
and
ingredients
of
his
own.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
and
that
--
and
that
gets
you
into
a
problem
because
his
contention
is
that
the
--
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
took
over
appropriate
for
the
uses
of
this
committee
if
you
will,
papers
and
records
which
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
by
that
time,
i
suppose,
knew
had
been
held
to
be
unlawfully
seized,
is
there
--
by
that
--
by
the
time
of
it's
proceeding
before
judge
ainsworth
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
there
had
been
state
court
decision
saying
that
this
material
was
unlawfully
seized.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
my
recollection
so
that
in
--
in
terms
of
the
sequence
of
events,
if
i
understand
mr.
kinoy.
he
is
saying
that
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
deliberately
took
over
papers
and
documents
that
had
been
unlawfully
seized
and
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
that
and
the
--
the
service
of
an
--
a
direct
service
of
an
unlawful
--
that
directs
an
unlawful
seizure
of
documents?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
am
assuming
that
they
took
over
the
papers
though
after
their
administrative
adjudication.
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
raid
was
unlawful.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand,
and
mr.
robb
contested
that.
i
didn't
understand
that
your
--
mr.
robb
contested
that
proposition.
justice
abe
fortas
i
may
be
wrong
but
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kinoy,
the
state
court
decision
holding
the
search
and
seizure
illegal
prior
to
the
proceedings
before
the
citation--
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
proceedings
before
judge
ainsworth
are
when?
