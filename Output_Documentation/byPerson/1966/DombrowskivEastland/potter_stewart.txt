justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
--
i
had
--
i'm
--
perhaps
misunderstood.
i
thought
that
the
other
members
of
the
committee
were
now
out
of
that
case
as
determined.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
on
the
trade
--
impleading.
there
have
been
impleading
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
pfister.
justice
potter
stewart
so
its
chairman
pfister
and
the
other
members
of
his
committee,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
--
the
--
how
do
the
state
police
or
the
state
policemen
is
out,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
who
else
is
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rogers?
justice
potter
stewart
never
joined.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
and
--
and
are
--
and
are
the
respondents
in
this
case
named
as
defendants
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
never
been
served.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
defendants
down
there
in
that
case
have
they
been
named
as
defendants
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
not
served?
justice
potter
stewart
uh-hmm.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
conspiracy
case
and
the
complaint
is
i
supposed
very
similar
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
even
if
that
were
not
--
even
if
the
subpoena
were
not
illegal,
it
could
still
be
one
of
the
overt
acts
in
an
illegal
conspiracy,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
overt
acts
themselves
need
not
be
illegal,
that
would
be
shown
as
to
--
in
the
carrying
out
of
an
illegal
conspiracy,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
putting
to
one
side
of
course,
the
problem
of
immunity
under
the
speech
debate
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that,
even
if
that's
true,
if
you're
wrong
about
your
--
on
your
first
point
then
if
they
were
as
co-conspirators,
they
were
co-conspirators
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
unlawful
seizure
out
in
louisiana
then
they
are
--
then
they
would
still
be
liable
even
if
they
would
have
immunity
of
--
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena,
wouldn't
that
be
right?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
hasn't
been
a
trial
yet.
justice
potter
stewart
there
hasn't
been
a
trial
yet.
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint
does
alleged
that
the
--
that
they
were
members
of
this
conspiracy.
justice
potter
stewart
to
--
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
rights
and
perhaps
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
--
of
the
petitioners.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
meantime,
copies
had
been
made
up,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
copies
are
now
where?
justice
potter
stewart
just
one
set
of
copies
or
several
sets
made?
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
doesn't
show.
the
record
shows
that
one
set
of
copies
was
made
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
done
at
the
request
or
certainly
with
the
knowledge
of
judge
ainsworth
though
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
record
shows
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
record
shows
that
or
at
least
the
counsel
represented
that
that
judge
ainsworth
has
to
get
in
touch
with
the
senator.
you
say
--
you
say
the
record
doesn't
show
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
going
back
a
bit.
i
can
un
â€“
i
understand
this
testimony
on
page
57,
i
guess
it's
mr.
sourwine?
justice
potter
stewart
it
should
be
this
is
not
correct.
i
think
we
have
that.
there's
another
change
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
next
sentence
i
think.
the
united
--
justice
potter
stewart
senate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
the
time
though
of
this
testimony
on
page
57,
the
records
were
across
the
river
or
whatever
boundary
is
that
can
cross
in
--
in
mississippi
--
justice
potter
stewart
across
the
state
line
of
mississippi.
and
the
explanation
by
mr.
sourwine
is
that
--
would
--
would
be
relevant
to
why
he,
mr.
sourwine,
took
them
into
his
possession
but
hardly
relevant
that's
why
it
took
him
across
the
state
line,
wouldn't
that
be
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they're
going
to
fix
it
so
he
could
then
very
well
be
sued
on
these
records
and
in
that
court.
justice
potter
stewart
so
he's
--
well,
the
result
is
he
is
sued
here.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
guess
he
got
his
wish.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
robb,
are
you
relying
on
the
--
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause
itself
or
on
the
--
what
i
know
is
thought
was
a
more
broad
--
broader
and
more
generalized
immunity
but
perhaps
less
complete
of
--
of
tenney
against
brandhove
and
barr
against
matteo.
justice
potter
stewart
--
upon
which
you're
relying
on
both
or
do
you
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
with
respect
to
him
you're
relying
in
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
basically
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
the
general
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity
as
found
in
tenney
against
brandhove
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
sourwine,
we
say
that
all
that
he
did
in
examining
the
scef
records
taking
to
senator
eastland
and
recommend
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena,
serving
the
subpoena,
causing
the
records
to
be
moved
to
washington.
all
of
these
things,
the
record
shows
were
done
by
him
in
his
official
capacity
as
counsel
for
the
subcommittee
and
they
were
all
mattered
generally
committed
to
his
control
of
the
discretion
as
general
counsel.
we
did
nothing
that
went
beyond
the
scope
of
his
legitimate
and
proper
duties
and
authority.
and
we
submit
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
what
follows
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
on
--
is
he
protected
you
say
then
by
the
--
explicitly
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
or
just
by
the
general
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
haven't
understood
that
it
was
exactly
six
and
one
and
a
half
does
in
the
other.
there's
an
overlap
perhaps.
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
that's
more
explicit
and
perhaps
more
complete
and
the
other
is
broader
and
perhaps
less
complete.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
immune
with
respect
to
defamation
--
justice
potter
stewart
defamation
in
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
damages
with
defamation.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kinoy,
how
about
the
equitable
part
of
your
course
of
action,
your
injunction.
you
haven't
spoken
of
that
or
you
have
missed
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
the
originals
and
--
and
mine
is
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
undisputed
facts
are,
that
the
originals
have
been
returned
to
your
client.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
copies
are
in
the
possession
not
on
these
respondents
but
rather
of
the
senate
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
the
--
aren't
there
statements
under
oaths
which
are
uncontradicted
to
the
effect
that
those
are
the
facts?
justice

stewart
no,
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
answer
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
under
oath?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
on
the
factual
issue,
saying
the
facts
are
undisputed.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
--
you
don't
take
issue
and
i
--
i
suppose
you
couldn't
do
with
the
proposition
that
if
the
facts
are
as
represented,
your
injunction
has
to
fail
because
it
--
it
would
work
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
be
impossible
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
