are
these

justice

white
mr.
kinoy,
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
there
had
been
no
involvement
of
state
officials
at
all
that
the
--
that
the
chairman
had
signed
a
blank
subpoena
and
sourwine
had
taken
the
subpoena
and
--
with
his
own
investigators
made
the
seizure
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.so
--
so
--
but
as
far
as
the
illegality
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
seizure
is
concerned
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
state
officials
in
the
end
of
it
is
that
isn't
what
makes
it
--
makes
it
illegal.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
--
this
is
just
some
way
to
get
under
the
civil
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
--
did
he
speak
to
chairman
--
chairman
eastland
about
securing
these
specific
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
the
chairman
authorized
to
get
this
particular
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
any
rule
of
the
authority
to
him,
this
--
it
will
get
any
records
you
want
him
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
the
authorizations
take
this
subpoena
and
go
get
these
records
except
that
they
could
not
describe
the
specific
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
that
--
but
they
were
filled
in
last
--
it
was
filled
in
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
chairman
signed
it
they
decided
they
could
not
describe
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
the
actual
service
of
the
subpoenas
was
before
the
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
commanded
the
state
officials
to
turn
them
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
argument
would
be
that
even
if
the
documents
had
been
specifically
listed
in
the
subpoenas
and
then
signed
by
senator
eastland
and
even
if
there
had
been
no
contact
whatsoever
between
the
state
and
federal
officials
up
until
--
until
after
the
seizure
by
the
state
officials
and
then
the
federal
people
were
notified
and
then
they
issued
a
subpoena,
even
so
you
would
say
you
were
entitled
to
recover
because
they
knew
when
the
service
--
not
when
they
serve
the
subpoena
but
when
they
actually
removed
them.
justice
byron
r.

that
they
have
been
improperly
