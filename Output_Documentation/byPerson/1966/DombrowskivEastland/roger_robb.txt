mr.
roger
robb
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
stand
on
two
propositions.
first,
when
we
say
that
the
petitioners
claim
from
damages
here
is
based
on
the
allegation
that
the
respondents
joined
with
state
authorities
in
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
the
petitioners
of
their
civil
rights
by
means
of
unlawful
arrest,
search
--
searches
and
seizures.
this
is
the
fundamental
essential
allegation
of
the
complaint.
we
submit
as
we
did
in
the
district
court
and
that
court
agreed
with
us
that
the
uncontradicted
proof
adduced
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
demonstrated
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
respondents
had
participated
in
no
such
conspiracy,
and
accordingly
that
there
was
no
genuine
issue
of
facts
of
trial,
now,
putting
the
matter
differently
that
in
the
event
of
a
trial
that
these
respondents
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict.
now
second,
in
our
view
the
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
legislative
immunity.
however,
if
the
court
deemed
unnecessary
to
reach
that
issue,
we
submit
that
that
doctrine
in
this
case
precludes
liability
what
damages
is.
the
only
act
charged
against
these
respondents
in
connection
with
this
alleged
conspiracy
is
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
and
the
transportation
of
the
records
to
washington
pursuant
to
the
subpoenas.
these
acts,
we
say,
were
well
within
the
scope
of
the
proper
legislative
duties
of
these
respondents
and
with
that
well
protected.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
but
i
think
that
had
to
be
something
shown
besides
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
then
there's
nothing,
nothing
whatever.
nothing
should
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
no
sir.
but
--
mr.
roger
robb
it
alleges
that
-–
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
that
is
correct
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
not
enough,
there
must
be
something
more.
mr.
roger
robb
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
know
about
that
sir.
i
might
say,
at
this
point,
i
intended
to
say
something
about
that.
mr.
kinoy
has
relied
upon
that.
and
the
ground
of
that
decision
was
as
i
read
it,
that,
and
this
is
page
134
of
the
appen
--
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioners.
the
ground
of
that
decision
was
and
mr.
pfister
made
a
statement
to
the
press
in
which
he
announced
that
all
the
members
of
the
committee
had
participated
in
this
plan
of
raid.
and
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“if
pfister
did
make
such
statement
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
statement
would
bear
on
the
accuracy
of
the
committee
members
affidavits
that
they
did
not
authorize
the
raids
and
in
fact
knew
nothing
of
them
before
they
would
carry
it
out”.
now,
in
that
case
we
have
affidavits
that
our
respondents
didn't
know
anything
about
these
raids
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
them.
and
there
was
no
countervailing
evidence
whatever.
so
our
case
differs
from
the
pfister
case.
now,
at
the
outset,
i
might
say
also
that
it
is
not
true,
it
is
not
a
fact
that
our
court
of
appeals
held
or
found
or
concluded
that
there
were
a
disputed
issues
of
fact
with
respect
to
our
client's
participation
in
this
conspiracy.
all
the
court
said
was
they
might
have
deal
with
that
question
but
they
did
not
reach
it
in
view
of
their
other
view
of
the
case.
now,
in
support
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
found
out
affidavits
from
all
of
the
alleged
conspirators,
all
the
people
who
had
knowledge
of
the
facts.
and
the
district
court
also
had
before
it
on
this
motion,
mr.
sourwine's
deposition
which
had
been
taken
by
the
petitioners.
the
affidavits
and
the
deposition
on
flatly
and
completely
negated
the
allegation
that
the
respondents
had
joined
in
this
conspiracy.
they
demonstrated
conclusively.
but
there
was
no
such
conservative
action.
the
leader
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
had
anything
or
whatever
to
do
with
the
arrest
of
dombrowski
or
the
searches
and
seizures.
that
prior
to
the
date
when
the
raids
were
made,
october
4,
both
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
understood
and
believe
only
that
the
state
authorities
might
subpoena
the
records
of
scef
and
they
were
not
told
and
did
not
know
that
action
by
way
of
arrest
warrants
was
even
contemplated.
but
i
say
this
was
established
by
the
affidavits
of
all
of
the
persons
having
knowledge
of
the
fact
--
facts.
now,
i
might
summarize
the
facts
briefly
because
i
think
the
statement
by
my
friend,
might
perhaps
be
somewhat
out
of
focus.
the
fact
shown
by
the
record
were
the
1955,
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
investigated
scef
and
probably
to
report
on
scef
and
his
apparent
or
--
apparent
organization
which
was
called
the
southern
conference
on
human
welfare.
these
reports
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
roger
robb
which
brief
is
your
honor
speaking
of?
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
know
sir.
but
the
we
are
quoting
here
from
the
subcommittee
of
report
--
mr.
roger
robb
we
are
--
i'm
referring
here
after
investigation
of
scef,
the
subcommittee
reported
that
scef
had
been
established
as
an
adjunct
of
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare.
and
that
was
based
upon
the
testimony
of
(inaudible).
mr.
roger
robb
well,
all
i
was
saying
is
that
this
was
in
the
report
of
the
subcommittee
which
led
mr.
rogers
when
his
committee
began
to
investigate
the
same
org
--
same
organization
to
get
in
touch
with
mr.
sourwine.
this
is
merely
by
way
of
showing
why
mr.
rogers
went
to
sourwine.
now,
in
1962,
the
state
committee
of
mr.
rogers,
his
committee,
called
this
joint
committee
on
un-american
activities,
started
to
investigate
scef
and
knowing
of
the
previous
senate
investigation
in
1954,
in
the
senate
report,
rogers
asked
mr.
sourwine
for
any
information
that
he
might
properly
give
about
scef.
and
sourwine
did
give
mr.
rogers
certain
information
from
the
public
records
of
his
committee
which
was
proper.
at
this
time
mr.
rogers
told
mr.
sourwine
that
his
committee
might
possibly
subpoena
the
records
of
scef
and
if
he
did
so
and
he
found
anything
that
was
of
interest
to
mr.
sourwine's
committee
that
he
would
let
mr.
sourwine
know,
this
i
think
is
an
orthodox
exchange
of
information
between
committees
and
investigators.
now
there
was
no
discussion
in
that
specific
records,
membership
records
or
otherwise.
this
is
categorically
stated
in
the
record.
later
about
the
middle
of
september
‘63,
mr.
rogers
telephoned
to
mr.
sourwine
and
asked
him,
in
the
event
that
the
state
committee
did
subpoena
the
records
of
scef
could
mr.
sourwine
and
mr.
mendel
who
is
an
expert
on
the
stuff
of
the
committee,
come
down
and
help
to
evaluate
them.
mr.
sourwine
took
the
matter
up
with
senator
eastland
who
told
him
that
he
and
mr.
mendel
might
go
down
if
and
only
if
it
developed
that
the
record
subpoenaed
related
to
matters
within
the
scope
of
his
committee's
powers
and
jurisdiction
and
authority.
that
is
the
communist
or
the
communist
front
activities
and
the
sound
that
the
record
shows
emphasized
that
the
subcommittee
had
no
interest
whatever
in
material
having
to
do
with
civil
rights
or
racial
matters.
now,
nothing
more
on
this
matter
at
scef
was
heard
from
mr.
rogers
until
october
the
4th
when
he
telephoned
to
mr.
sourwine
and
told
him
the
state
committee
had
the
scef
material
in
his
possession
under
subpoena
and
the
material
would
be
of
great
interest
to
mr.
sourwine's
committee.
now
the
record
shows
that
after
his
talk
with
mr.
sourwine
in
september,
mid-september,
mr.
rogers
and
his
committee
had
concluded
on
the
basis
of
their
investigation
that
scef
was
in
violation
of
the
state
statute,
and
therefore
that
they
would
proceed
by
way
of
arrest
and
search
warrants
rather
than
by
way
of
subpoena.
now,
the
record
shows
conclusive
that
neither
senator
eastland
nor
mr.
sourwine
knew
anything
of
this
decision.
they
weren't
told
about
it,
they
weren't
consulted
about
it
and
they
had
nothing
more
having
to
do
with
the
resulting
raids
and
arrest.
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
mr.
sourwine
and
senator
eastland
believed
that
at
all
times,
prior
to
october
4,
1963,
that
if
the
state
committee
acquired
the
scef
records,
it
would
be
done
by
way
of
subpoenas.
and
the
first
intermission
they
had
to
the
contrary
came
in
mr.
rogers
call
on
october
4.
now,
my
friend
referred
to
an
affidavit
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
his
brief
from
a
deputy
counsel
or
investigator
of
the
state
committee
in
which
he
contend
shows
that
this
plan
to
seize
the
records
by
arrest
warrants
was
made
in
august.
in
the
first
place,
that
affidavit
had
dated
over
a
year
after
the
judgment
in
this
case
was
entered.
it
does
not
apply
in
the
record
in
this
case.
in
the
second
place,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
affidavit,
you'll
see
that
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
necessarily
carry
the
implication
which
my
friend
contends
that
it
does.
all
it
says
is
that
mr.
rogers
is
going
to
talk
to
the
state
police
and
his
own
affidavit
filed
by
us
shows
that
he
wasn't
in
touched
with
the
state
police
and
had
examined
their
files
prior
to
october.
now,
as
i
said,
mr.
rogers
asked
mr.
sourwine
and
mr.
mandel
to
come
down
and
they
did
go
down.
the
next
day,
october
5,
they
looked
over
the
material,
thought
it
was
of
interest
to
their
committee
and
thought
it
came
within
the
scope
of
their
committee's
authority
and
therefore
mr.
sourwine
calls
senator
eastland,
told
him
this
and
senator
eastland
authorized
him
to
fill
out
and
serve
the
subpoena
or
subpoenas
on
the
state
authorities
calling
upon
them
to
produce
these
records
in
washington,
october
29.
mr.
roger
robb
the
--
the
rules
of
the
committee,
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
provided
at
that
time
that
subpoenas
could
be
issued
by
the
chairman
and
the
practice
of
the
committee
at
all
times
up
until
then
was
that
the
chairman
decided
when
the
subpoena
should
be
issued.
these
subpoenas
were
issued
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
committee
at
that
time.
this
was
october
the
5th.
on
december
the
30th
of
the
same
year,
our
court
of
appeals
in
the
shelton
case
held
that
although
the
chairman
might
issue
these
subpoenas,
they
had
to
be
authorized
by
the
full
committee
but
this
of
course
was
after
these
subpoenas
had
been
issued
and
served
under
the
issuance
held
at
the
time
they
were
issued
were
is
in
full
accord
with
the
practice
of
the
committee
at
that
time.
and
our
position
gently
jumping
ahead
of
that
is
that
this
was
well
within
the
scope
of
the
legislative
authority
of
the
committee.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
they
was
--
they
were
filled
in
at
--
filled
in
by
mr.
sourwine
prior
to
service
of
course.
they
were
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
after
he
got
the
authority
of
the
chairman,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
after
he
got
the
chairman's
authority,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
he
telephoned
--
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
no.
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
they
did
describe
the
specific
--
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
what
happened,
he
test
--
mr.
sourwine
testified
on
the
deposition
that
the
committee
had
filed
a
blank
subpoenas
signed
by
the
chairman.
and
that
these
were
filled
out
from
time
to
time
when
they
arose,
he
took
some
of
these
with
him
to
--
to
the
baton
rouge
where
the
records
where.
he
examined
the
records
preliminarily.
he
concluded
that
they
were
of
interest
to
the
committee
and
did
come
within
the
--
the
scope
of
their
authority.
he
telephoned
senator
eastland,
told
him
what
the
records
were
in
general
and
senator
eastland
authorized
him
then
to
fill
out
and
serve
these
subpoenas.
now,
again
getting
ahead
of
it,
our
position
is
that
even
though
these
subpoenas
might
technically
have
been
invalid
and
my
--
and
even
though
this
might
have
been
a
defense
against
a
charge
of
contempt,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
service
of
these
subpoenas
subjects
these
respondents
to
damages.
the
case
is
cited
by
our
friend,
gojack
case
and
other
cases
involved
charges
of
contempt
of
criminal
charges.
and
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
the
fact
that
a
subpoena
might
be
invalid
in
the
contracts
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
justify
a
refusal
or
failure
to
respond,
that
fact
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
persons
who
issued
the
subpoena
must
respond
in
damages.
now,
they
might
say
after
the
service
of
these
subpoenas
on
october
5,
mr.
sourwine
designated
general
burbank,
the
superintendent
of
state
police
to
be
--
to
be
the
custodian
of
the
records
attending
their
tracked
petition
to
washington.
mr.
mandel
the
record
shows
stayed
behind
to
examine
the
records
at
some
length.
i
might
say
all
these
records
were
returned
to
the
petitioners
in
february
1965.
those
events
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
mr.
roger
robb
they're
in
the
possession
of
the
senate
committee
and
not
these
respondents.
mr.
roger
robb
frankly,
i
don't
know
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
i
think
so.
the
resolution
which
is
in
the
record
and
it's
printed
at
--
at
page
36
of
the
record
suggests
that
copies
would
be
made
that
all
of
the
original
records
obtained
under
the
subpoena
before
the
start
with
the
permanent
records
of
the
subcommittee
in
(inaudible)
so-called
the
status.
mr.
roger
robb
no
sir.
now,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
here.
on
the
14th
of
november,
the
subcommittee
voted
in
effect
to
ratify
the
actions
of
senator
eastland
and
to
make
all
these
records
as
far
as
the
committee
thought
that
we
don't
necessarily
argue
that
this
was
an
ex
post
facto
authorization
of
the
subpoena.
but
we
do
argue
that
it
certainly
demonstrated
that
in
issuing
and
serving
this
subpoena,
these
respondents
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
scope
of
their
legislative
authority.
now,
coming
for
a
moment
to
the
matter
of
the
removal
of
this
material
from
the
state
of
louisiana
about
which
my
friend
made
not
a
vigorous
complaint.
as
explained
by
mr.
sourwine,
his
deposition
and
this
is
appeared
at
the
records
--
in
the
record
at
page
57.
it
was
felt
that
the
documents
were
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
senate
and
if
there
were
to
be
litigation
about
them,
only
mr.
sourwine
and
senator
eastland
and
the
senate
should
be
involved
and
not
colonel
burbank
who
as
mr.
sourwine
says
wore
two
hats.
one
as
head
of
the
state
police
and
one
as
custodian
for
us
and
he
might
become
involved
in
an
awkward
situation.
secondly
--
mr.
roger
robb
that's
right.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
it
would
never
a
statement
made
by
senator
eastland
to
mr.
sourwine.
now,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
telegram
to
which
mr.
kinoy
referred
and
which
is
printed
at
page
54
of
the
record
was
not
from
judge
ainsworth.
it
was
from
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
mr.
brennan.
and
the
telegram
read
federal
judge
robert
ainsworth
has
requested
your
presence
in
his
office
9:30
am,
october
28
to
discuss
an
injunction
and
joining,
turning
over
scef
and
smith
and
waltzer
records
to
senator
eastland.
that
was
all
senator
eastland
knew
about
it.
he'd
never
been
served
by
any
process.
he
was
never
been
notified
by
the
court
and
it
was
signed
by
mr.
brennan.
and
mr.
sour
--
mr.
roger
robb
that,
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
assume
--
mr.
roger
robb
--
that's
not
being
thought
so.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
find
it
in
--
in
the
record.perhaps
my
friend
can
point
it
out
if
it's
there.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
i
might
say
there's
a
mistake
in
that
transcript.
i
--
i
hope
your
honor
has
the
correct
copy
of
it,
the
last
question
and
answer
on
page
57.
question,
is
it
correct
if
the
purpose
of
the
removal
of
the
documents
must
to
put
them
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
judge
in
new
orleans.
the
answer
in
my
print
is,
this
is
correct,
it
should
be,
this
is
not
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
the
federal
judge
whatever
had
no
jurisdiction
under
any
circumstances
because
i
might
point
out
that
certainly
the
records
--
mr.
roger
robb
when
they
were
brought
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
our
friends
have
demonstrated
were
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
state
district
court
for
this
district
and
i
assume
that
that
was
known
to
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
across
the
state
line,
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
he
said
that
he
--
he
said
frankly,
that
was
in
his
mind
that
if
anybody
who
is
going
to
get
sued
it
was
going
to
be
he
and
senator
--
him
and
senator
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
he
could
be
sued
here
of
course.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
yes
sir.
he
is
sued
here.
mr.
roger
robb
now,
i
might
say
yes,
that
is
--
that's
one
thing
we're
sure
of.
i
might
say
also,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
we
submit
that
this
action
which
occurred
three
weeks
after
the
arrest
and
the
search
and
the
seizures
which
are
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
which
are
the
gist
to
that
action.
these
--
these
are
action
in
moving
the
records
across
the
state
line.
it
seems
to
us
it's
hardly
enough
to
cast
any
substantial
doubt
on
the
uncontradicted
proof
that
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
previous
seizure
of
the
records.
this
is
not
a
lawsuit
for
moving
records
across
the
state
line.
it's
a
lawsuit
for
conspiring
to
bring
about
unlawful
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
roger
robb
i
know.
mr.
roger
robb
as
i
understand
their
complaint,
your
honor,
their
complaint
is
that
--
that
they
alleged
that
this
taking
of
the
records
across
the
state
line
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy.
not
that
it
was
an
independent
substantive
cause
of
action.
it
was
all
part
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
that
this
is
--
mr.
roger
robb
if
this
is
his
theory,
it's
a
new
theory
that
i
never
heard
before
because
along
this
brief
--
mr.
roger
robb
now,
i
might
add
that
the
--
the
affidavits
of
mr.
sourwine's
deposition
were
not
mere
naked
denials
as
our
friend
suggest
but
they
were
detailed
in
circumstantial
statements
by
everybody
who
had
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
reciting
exactly
of
what
the
relevant
actions
and
statements
of
those
people
had
been.
and
the
evidence
produced
by
our
respondents
was
uncontradicted.
the
petitioners
do
not
traverse
a
single
fact
that
we
relied
upon
except
for
taking
mr.
sourwine's
deposition,
they
made
no
attempt
to
use
the
federal
discovery
procedure.
they
did
not
impeach
any
of
our
witnesses
or
attempt
to
do
so.
and
i
might
point
out
that
pursuant
to
the
rule
9h
of
the
district
court,
our
respondents
filed
with
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
statement
of
the
material
facts
as
to
which
they
contended,
there
was
no
issue.
their
statement
is
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
83
and
recites
in
summary
form
the
facts
that
i
have
mentioned
here
today.
paragraph
43
of
that
statement
recites
that
neither
senator
eastland
nor
mr.
sourwine
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
acquisition
of
the
scef
material
by
the
joint
committee
or
with
the
preparation,
issuance
or
execution
of
the
arrest
and
search
warrants
where
under
the
joint
committee
obtained
the
material
to
scef.
now,
rule
9h
provides
that
the
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
may
assume
that
the
facts
recited
in
such
a
statement
are
admitted
unless
they
are
controverted
by
opposing
statements
and
the
petitioners
filed
no
such
opposing
statement.
in
short,
we
submit
and
we
have
shown
--
we
showed
by
uncontradicted
proof
that
the
conspiracy
upon
which
this
suit
is
rested,
never
existed
that
the
petitioners
introduced
no
evidence
casting
a
doubt
upon
the
showing
we
made
nor
have
they
demonstrated
any
possibility
that
in
the
event
of
a
trial,
they
could
produce
such
evidence.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
that's
what
they
say,
your
honor.
but
i
submit
that
you're
not
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
on
a
mere
gossamer
--
gossamer
web
of
suspicion
which
we've
done
an
amount
to
prove
it
all.
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
the
federal
courts
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
on
that
point
that
one
of
the
leading
cases
as
taken
by
judge
learned
hand
which
he
said
about
what
i've
just
said
although
in
better
language.
that's
our
answer.
now,
returning
to
the
second
branch
of
our
argument
and
to
be
a
matter
of
legislative
immunity
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
only
acts
charged
against
the
respondents
in
connection
with
this
alleged
conspiracy
with
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
for
the
scef
records
and
moving
of
the
records
to
washington
and
this
conduct,
we
submit,
was
well
within
the
scope
of
the
official
duties
of
the
respondent
and
was
therefore
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
great
case
of
kilbourn
against
thompson,
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
conferred
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
to
support
the
rights
of
the
people
or
enabling
their
representatives
to
execute
the
functions
of
their
office
without
fear
of
prosecutions,
civil
or
criminal.
last
time
in
the
johnson
case,
this
court
said
the
privilege
will
be
read
broadly
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
accordingly,
and
we
have
seen
from
the
cases,
the
privilege
is
not
limited
to
speech
or
debate
strictly
as
such
but
attaches
to
all
things
that
are
generally
done
in
the
session
of
the
house
by
one
of
its
members
on
the
business
before
it
and
this
includes
investigation
of
outstanding
committees
or
special
committees.
and
as
the
court
has
held
or
said
in
several
cases,
tenney
against
brandhove
and
the
johnson
case,
this
privilege
is
not
destroyed
by
allegations
of
proof
of
illegality
or
claim
of
non-worthy
purpose.
it
protects
the
legislator
so
long
as
he
acts
in
a
field
where
a
legislator
traditionally
have
the
power
to
act
and
is
lost
only
when
the
acts
of
the
legislator
are
nowise
related
to
the
due
functioning
of
the
legislative
process.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
it
does.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
i
think
it
should
and
does,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
we
rely
upon,
so
far
as
senator
eastland
is
concerned,
we
think
the
issuance
of
this
subpoena,
these
subpoenas
was
clearly
within
the
legitimate
sphere
of
his
legislative
activities
and
duties.
we
think
that
the
activity
of
mr.
--
mr.
roger
robb
legislative
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
no.
mr.
roger
robb
--
is
that
it?
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
your
honor.
but
there
isn't
any
issue
of
the
fact
by
us
admitting
that
everything
he
did
was
in
this
capacity.
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
we
follow
from
this,
if
it
please
your
honor,
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
barr
case
and
other
case
as
howard
case,
a
committee
on
executive
must
acts
through
agents
and
assistance
and
counsel.
this
is
a
necessary
corollary
of
the
function
of
the
government.
and
since
this
is
true
and
we
submit
that
since
the
must
of
necessity
be
a
delegation
of
duties
and
deciding
by
legislators
as
well
as
executive,
we
submit
that
the
agent
of
the
legislator
should
partake
of
the
same
privilege
of
immunity
which
the
legislator
has.
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
say
partly
by
the
general
doctrine
although
it's
six
and
one
and
a
half
does
in
the
other--
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
i
think.
mr.
roger
robb
but
i
think
it
would
be
anomalous,
may
it
please
your
honor,
to
hold
that
the
deputy
or
ranked
administrator
which
i
think
with
mr.
barr's
provision
--
mr.
roger
robb
--
would
be
immune
whereas
the
general
counsel
of
the
congressional
committee
was
not.
mr.
roger
robb
--
damages
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
damages.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
i
think
it
will
be
anomalous
to
hold
that
the
deputy
marshal
who
served
the
subpoena
issued
by
the
court
would
be
immune
and
there
are
such
cases
even
though
the
subpoenas
are
invalid.
subpoena
are
served
the
process
issued
by
the
court
would
be
immune
but
a
counsel
of
the
same
committee
who
served
the
similar
subpoena
would
have
to
respond
in
damages.
i
think
the
same
principle
works
in
both
cases,
applies
in
both
cases.
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
i
said
that
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
if
i
--
if
can't
entirely
understand
that
except
that
for
a
--
it
says
that
the
privilege
extended
to
a
legislator
is
entitled
to
a
greater
respect
and
not
extend
it
a
subordinate.
i
don't
conceive
that
that
says
that
the
subordinate
has
no
privilege.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
robb
i
can
see
how,
may
it
please
your
honor,
if
you
took
this
hypothetical
question,
i
take
it
that
for
a
no
speech
made
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
could
a
senator
or
a
member
of
the
house
be
sued
and
have
to
respond
in
damages
for
libel
in
those
cases.
however,
i
can
conceive
of
a
press
release
or
speech
issued
by
some
subordinate
which
so
far
departed
from
the
scope
of
his
appropriate
duties
that
he
might
be
liable
to
damages.
and
i
think
perhaps
that's
what
the
court
is
talking
about.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
if
that's
what
you
had,
may
it
please
your
honor
in
the
wheeldin
case,
wheelding
against
wheeler.
wheeler
issued
a
subpoena
on
his
own
without
any
authority
from
anybody,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
or
anybody
else
and
he
was
held
liable
whereas
in
our
case,
we
don't
have
that
situation.
of
course,
in
the
kilbourn
case.
in
the
kilbourn
case,
the
court
held
i
think
--
and
i
think
the
plain
intendment
of
the
court's
decision
was
perhaps
the
members
of
the
committee
and
who
had
kilbourn
held
in
contempt
actively
participate
in
his
arrest.
they
--
they
would
have
been
liable.
but
everything
they
did
was
within
the
scope
of
their
legislative
functions.
therefore,
they
were
not
liable.
now,
we
say
here
everything
that
senator
eastland
did
and
mr.
sourwine
did,
came
within
the
scope
of
their
legislative
functions.
let
me
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear.
if
i
wasn't
sure
from
mr.
kinoy's
argument
on
whether
he
was
suggesting
and
i
was
contended
that
there's
a
proper
function
for
unanimous
state
center
or
counsel
for
senate
committee
to
go
out
and
make
illegal
arrest,
searches
and
seizures,
i'm
contending
no
such
thing.
i
certainly
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
contend
that
there's
such
a
thing.
this
is
obviously
not
a
legislative
function.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
certainly.
and
i
don't
think,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
you
can
reason
ex
post
facto
so
to
speak
and
because
--
because
mr.
sourwine
and
the
committee
took
over
these
papers
after
the
raid
that
therefore
they
must
be
held
responsible
for
whatever
happened
on
the
raid.
mr.
roger
robb
precisely.
but
--
but
--
mr.
roger
robb
precisely.
but
the
gist
of
the
complaint
is
that
they
participated
in
the
conspiracy
to
make
the
raid.
and
this
happened
after
the
raid.
now,
the
petitioners
have
not
produced
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
these
--
these
respondents
knew
anything
about
the
raid,
had
anything
to
do
it.
and
they
won't
be
able
to
produce
any
such
evidence
on
trial.
they
may
hope
to
but
--
but
they've
had
every
opportunity
to
do
so.
now,
there
were
some
reference
made
in
taking
senator
keating's
deposition
and
that
mr.
kinoy
came
into
court
the
day
of
the
argument
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
letter
from
senator
keating
which
is
in
the
record
here
which
--
in
which
he
protested
against
the
--
that
issuance
of
these
subpoenas
and
appeared
to
mr.
kinoy
and
his
co-counsel
had
known
about
this
for
weeks
and
haven't
done
anything
about
it.
in
any
event,
the
letter
is
completely
irrelevant.
these
petitioners
had
every
opportunity
to
explore,
to
take
depositions,
and
to
get
--
and
to
bring
in
evidence
but
they
brought
in
nothing
whatever
to
contravene
all
statements
of
facts.
on
these
grounds,
may
it
please
the
court,
first
that
the
uncontradicted
proof
shows
that
these
petitioners
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
conspiracy
which
is
the
gist
of
their
case
and
second,
that
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
and
the
taking
of
the
records
to
washington
pursuant
to
those
subpoenas
was
well
within
the
legitimate
scope
of
their
legislative
duties
and
therefore
privileged,
we
submit
that
the
court
ought
to
be
affirmed,
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents
stand
on
two
propositions.
first,
when
we
say
that
the
petitioners
claim
from
damages
here
is
based
on
the
allegation
that
the
respondents
joined
with
state
authorities
in
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
the
petitioners
of
their
civil
rights
by
means
of
unlawful
arrest,
search
--
searches
and
seizures.
this
is
the
fundamental
essential
allegation
of
the
complaint.
we
submit
as
we
did
in
the
district
court
and
that
court
agreed
with
us
that
the
uncontradicted
proof
adduced
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
demonstrated
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
respondents
had
participated
in
no
such
conspiracy,
and
accordingly
that
there
was
no
genuine
issue
of
facts
of
trial,
now,
putting
the
matter
differently
that
in
the
event
of
a
trial
that
these
respondents
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict.
now
second,
in
our
view
the
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
legislative
immunity.
however,
if
the
court
deemed
unnecessary
to
reach
that
issue,
we
submit
that
that
doctrine
in
this
case
precludes
liability
what
damages
is.
the
only
act
charged
against
these
respondents
in
connection
with
this
alleged
conspiracy
is
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
and
the
transportation
of
the
records
to
washington
pursuant
to
the
subpoenas.
these
acts,
we
say,
were
well
within
the
scope
of
the
proper
legislative
duties
of
these
respondents
and
with
that
well
protected.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
but
i
think
that
had
to
be
something
shown
besides
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
then
there's
nothing,
nothing
whatever.
nothing
should
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
no
sir.
but
--
mr.
roger
robb
it
alleges
that
-–
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
that
is
correct
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
not
enough,
there
must
be
something
more.
mr.
roger
robb
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
know
about
that
sir.
i
might
say,
at
this
point,
i
intended
to
say
something
about
that.
mr.
kinoy
has
relied
upon
that.
and
the
ground
of
that
decision
was
as
i
read
it,
that,
and
this
is
page
134
of
the
appen
--
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioners.
the
ground
of
that
decision
was
and
mr.
pfister
made
a
statement
to
the
press
in
which
he
announced
that
all
the
members
of
the
committee
had
participated
in
this
plan
of
raid.
and
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“if
pfister
did
make
such
statement
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
statement
would
bear
on
the
accuracy
of
the
committee
members
affidavits
that
they
did
not
authorize
the
raids
and
in
fact
knew
nothing
of
them
before
they
would
carry
it
out”.
now,
in
that
case
we
have
affidavits
that
our
respondents
didn't
know
anything
about
these
raids
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
them.
and
there
was
no
countervailing
evidence
whatever.
so
our
case
differs
from
the
pfister
case.
now,
at
the
outset,
i
might
say
also
that
it
is
not
true,
it
is
not
a
fact
that
our
court
of
appeals
held
or
found
or
concluded
that
there
were
a
disputed
issues
of
fact
with
respect
to
our
client's
participation
in
this
conspiracy.
all
the
court
said
was
they
might
have
deal
with
that
question
but
they
did
not
reach
it
in
view
of
their
other
view
of
the
case.
now,
in
support
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
found
out
affidavits
from
all
of
the
alleged
conspirators,
all
the
people
who
had
knowledge
of
the
facts.
and
the
district
court
also
had
before
it
on
this
motion,
mr.
sourwine's
deposition
which
had
been
taken
by
the
petitioners.
the
affidavits
and
the
deposition
on
flatly
and
completely
negated
the
allegation
that
the
respondents
had
joined
in
this
conspiracy.
they
demonstrated
conclusively.
but
there
was
no
such
conservative
action.
the
leader
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
had
anything
or
whatever
to
do
with
the
arrest
of
dombrowski
or
the
searches
and
seizures.
that
prior
to
the
date
when
the
raids
were
made,
october
4,
both
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
understood
and
believe
only
that
the
state
authorities
might
subpoena
the
records
of
scef
and
they
were
not
told
and
did
not
know
that
action
by
way
of
arrest
warrants
was
even
contemplated.
but
i
say
this
was
established
by
the
affidavits
of
all
of
the
persons
having
knowledge
of
the
fact
--
facts.
now,
i
might
summarize
the
facts
briefly
because
i
think
the
statement
by
my
friend,
might
perhaps
be
somewhat
out
of
focus.
the
fact
shown
by
the
record
were
the
1955,
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
investigated
scef
and
probably
to
report
on
scef
and
his
apparent
or
--
apparent
organization
which
was
called
the
southern
conference
on
human
welfare.
these
reports
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
roger
robb
which
brief
is
your
honor
speaking
of?
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
know
sir.
but
the
we
are
quoting
here
from
the
subcommittee
of
report
--
mr.
roger
robb
we
are
--
i'm
referring
here
after
investigation
of
scef,
the
subcommittee
reported
that
scef
had
been
established
as
an
adjunct
of
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare.
and
that
was
based
upon
the
testimony
of
(inaudible).
mr.
roger
robb
well,
all
i
was
saying
is
that
this
was
in
the
report
of
the
subcommittee
which
led
mr.
rogers
when
his
committee
began
to
investigate
the
same
org
--
same
organization
to
get
in
touch
with
mr.
sourwine.
this
is
merely
by
way
of
showing
why
mr.
rogers
went
to
sourwine.
now,
in
1962,
the
state
committee
of
mr.
rogers,
his
committee,
called
this
joint
committee
on
un-american
activities,
started
to
investigate
scef
and
knowing
of
the
previous
senate
investigation
in
1954,
in
the
senate
report,
rogers
asked
mr.
sourwine
for
any
information
that
he
might
properly
give
about
scef.
and
sourwine
did
give
mr.
rogers
certain
information
from
the
public
records
of
his
committee
which
was
proper.
at
this
time
mr.
rogers
told
mr.
sourwine
that
his
committee
might
possibly
subpoena
the
records
of
scef
and
if
he
did
so
and
he
found
anything
that
was
of
interest
to
mr.
sourwine's
committee
that
he
would
let
mr.
sourwine
know,
this
i
think
is
an
orthodox
exchange
of
information
between
committees
and
investigators.
now
there
was
no
discussion
in
that
specific
records,
membership
records
or
otherwise.
this
is
categorically
stated
in
the
record.
later
about
the
middle
of
september
‘63,
mr.
rogers
telephoned
to
mr.
sourwine
and
asked
him,
in
the
event
that
the
state
committee
did
subpoena
the
records
of
scef
could
mr.
sourwine
and
mr.
mendel
who
is
an
expert
on
the
stuff
of
the
committee,
come
down
and
help
to
evaluate
them.
mr.
sourwine
took
the
matter
up
with
senator
eastland
who
told
him
that
he
and
mr.
mendel
might
go
down
if
and
only
if
it
developed
that
the
record
subpoenaed
related
to
matters
within
the
scope
of
his
committee's
powers
and
jurisdiction
and
authority.
that
is
the
communist
or
the
communist
front
activities
and
the
sound
that
the
record
shows
emphasized
that
the
subcommittee
had
no
interest
whatever
in
material
having
to
do
with
civil
rights
or
racial
matters.
now,
nothing
more
on
this
matter
at
scef
was
heard
from
mr.
rogers
until
october
the
4th
when
he
telephoned
to
mr.
sourwine
and
told
him
the
state
committee
had
the
scef
material
in
his
possession
under
subpoena
and
the
material
would
be
of
great
interest
to
mr.
sourwine's
committee.
now
the
record
shows
that
after
his
talk
with
mr.
sourwine
in
september,
mid-september,
mr.
rogers
and
his
committee
had
concluded
on
the
basis
of
their
investigation
that
scef
was
in
violation
of
the
state
statute,
and
therefore
that
they
would
proceed
by
way
of
arrest
and
search
warrants
rather
than
by
way
of
subpoena.
now,
the
record
shows
conclusive
that
neither
senator
eastland
nor
mr.
sourwine
knew
anything
of
this
decision.
they
weren't
told
about
it,
they
weren't
consulted
about
it
and
they
had
nothing
more
having
to
do
with
the
resulting
raids
and
arrest.
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
mr.
sourwine
and
senator
eastland
believed
that
at
all
times,
prior
to
october
4,
1963,
that
if
the
state
committee
acquired
the
scef
records,
it
would
be
done
by
way
of
subpoenas.
and
the
first
intermission
they
had
to
the
contrary
came
in
mr.
rogers
call
on
october
4.
now,
my
friend
referred
to
an
affidavit
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
his
brief
from
a
deputy
counsel
or
investigator
of
the
state
committee
in
which
he
contend
shows
that
this
plan
to
seize
the
records
by
arrest
warrants
was
made
in
august.
in
the
first
place,
that
affidavit
had
dated
over
a
year
after
the
judgment
in
this
case
was
entered.
it
does
not
apply
in
the
record
in
this
case.
in
the
second
place,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
affidavit,
you'll
see
that
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
necessarily
carry
the
implication
which
my
friend
contends
that
it
does.
all
it
says
is
that
mr.
rogers
is
going
to
talk
to
the
state
police
and
his
own
affidavit
filed
by
us
shows
that
he
wasn't
in
touched
with
the
state
police
and
had
examined
their
files
prior
to
october.
now,
as
i
said,
mr.
rogers
asked
mr.
sourwine
and
mr.
mandel
to
come
down
and
they
did
go
down.
the
next
day,
october
5,
they
looked
over
the
material,
thought
it
was
of
interest
to
their
committee
and
thought
it
came
within
the
scope
of
their
committee's
authority
and
therefore
mr.
sourwine
calls
senator
eastland,
told
him
this
and
senator
eastland
authorized
him
to
fill
out
and
serve
the
subpoena
or
subpoenas
on
the
state
authorities
calling
upon
them
to
produce
these
records
in
washington,
october
29.
mr.
roger
robb
the
--
the
rules
of
the
committee,
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
provided
at
that
time
that
subpoenas
could
be
issued
by
the
chairman
and
the
practice
of
the
committee
at
all
times
up
until
then
was
that
the
chairman
decided
when
the
subpoena
should
be
issued.
these
subpoenas
were
issued
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
committee
at
that
time.
this
was
october
the
5th.
on
december
the
30th
of
the
same
year,
our
court
of
appeals
in
the
shelton
case
held
that
although
the
chairman
might
issue
these
subpoenas,
they
had
to
be
authorized
by
the
full
committee
but
this
of
course
was
after
these
subpoenas
had
been
issued
and
served
under
the
issuance
held
at
the
time
they
were
issued
were
is
in
full
accord
with
the
practice
of
the
committee
at
that
time.
and
our
position
gently
jumping
ahead
of
that
is
that
this
was
well
within
the
scope
of
the
legislative
authority
of
the
committee.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
they
was
--
they
were
filled
in
at
--
filled
in
by
mr.
sourwine
prior
to
service
of
course.
they
were
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
after
he
got
the
authority
of
the
chairman,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
after
he
got
the
chairman's
authority,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
he
telephoned
--
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
no.
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
they
did
describe
the
specific
--
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
what
happened,
he
test
--
mr.
sourwine
testified
on
the
deposition
that
the
committee
had
filed
a
blank
subpoenas
signed
by
the
chairman.
and
that
these
were
filled
out
from
time
to
time
when
they
arose,
he
took
some
of
these
with
him
to
--
to
the
baton
rouge
where
the
records
where.
he
examined
the
records
preliminarily.
he
concluded
that
they
were
of
interest
to
the
committee
and
did
come
within
the
--
the
scope
of
their
authority.
he
telephoned
senator
eastland,
told
him
what
the
records
were
in
general
and
senator
eastland
authorized
him
then
to
fill
out
and
serve
these
subpoenas.
now,
again
getting
ahead
of
it,
our
position
is
that
even
though
these
subpoenas
might
technically
have
been
invalid
and
my
--
and
even
though
this
might
have
been
a
defense
against
a
charge
of
contempt,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
service
of
these
subpoenas
subjects
these
respondents
to
damages.
the
case
is
cited
by
our
friend,
gojack
case
and
other
cases
involved
charges
of
contempt
of
criminal
charges.
and
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
the
fact
that
a
subpoena
might
be
invalid
in
the
contracts
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
justify
a
refusal
or
failure
to
respond,
that
fact
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
persons
who
issued
the
subpoena
must
respond
in
damages.
now,
they
might
say
after
the
service
of
these
subpoenas
on
october
5,
mr.
sourwine
designated
general
burbank,
the
superintendent
of
state
police
to
be
--
to
be
the
custodian
of
the
records
attending
their
tracked
petition
to
washington.
mr.
mandel
the
record
shows
stayed
behind
to
examine
the
records
at
some
length.
i
might
say
all
these
records
were
returned
to
the
petitioners
in
february
1965.
those
events
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
mr.
roger
robb
they're
in
the
possession
of
the
senate
committee
and
not
these
respondents.
mr.
roger
robb
frankly,
i
don't
know
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
i
think
so.
the
resolution
which
is
in
the
record
and
it's
printed
at
--
at
page
36
of
the
record
suggests
that
copies
would
be
made
that
all
of
the
original
records
obtained
under
the
subpoena
before
the
start
with
the
permanent
records
of
the
subcommittee
in
(inaudible)
so-called
the
status.
mr.
roger
robb
no
sir.
now,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
here.
on
the
14th
of
november,
the
subcommittee
voted
in
effect
to
ratify
the
actions
of
senator
eastland
and
to
make
all
these
records
as
far
as
the
committee
thought
that
we
don't
necessarily
argue
that
this
was
an
ex
post
facto
authorization
of
the
subpoena.
but
we
do
argue
that
it
certainly
demonstrated
that
in
issuing
and
serving
this
subpoena,
these
respondents
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
scope
of
their
legislative
authority.
now,
coming
for
a
moment
to
the
matter
of
the
removal
of
this
material
from
the
state
of
louisiana
about
which
my
friend
made
not
a
vigorous
complaint.
as
explained
by
mr.
sourwine,
his
deposition
and
this
is
appeared
at
the
records
--
in
the
record
at
page
57.
it
was
felt
that
the
documents
were
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
senate
and
if
there
were
to
be
litigation
about
them,
only
mr.
sourwine
and
senator
eastland
and
the
senate
should
be
involved
and
not
colonel
burbank
who
as
mr.
sourwine
says
wore
two
hats.
one
as
head
of
the
state
police
and
one
as
custodian
for
us
and
he
might
become
involved
in
an
awkward
situation.
secondly
--
mr.
roger
robb
that's
right.
mr.
roger
robb
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
it
would
never
a
statement
made
by
senator
eastland
to
mr.
sourwine.
now,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
telegram
to
which
mr.
kinoy
referred
and
which
is
printed
at
page
54
of
the
record
was
not
from
judge
ainsworth.
it
was
from
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
mr.
brennan.
and
the
telegram
read
federal
judge
robert
ainsworth
has
requested
your
presence
in
his
office
9:30
am,
october
28
to
discuss
an
injunction
and
joining,
turning
over
scef
and
smith
and
waltzer
records
to
senator
eastland.
that
was
all
senator
eastland
knew
about
it.
he'd
never
been
served
by
any
process.
he
was
never
been
notified
by
the
court
and
it
was
signed
by
mr.
brennan.
and
mr.
sour
--
mr.
roger
robb
that,
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
assume
--
mr.
roger
robb
--
that's
not
being
thought
so.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
find
it
in
--
in
the
record.perhaps
my
friend
can
point
it
out
if
it's
there.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
i
might
say
there's
a
mistake
in
that
transcript.
i
--
i
hope
your
honor
has
the
correct
copy
of
it,
the
last
question
and
answer
on
page
57.
question,
is
it
correct
if
the
purpose
of
the
removal
of
the
documents
must
to
put
them
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
judge
in
new
orleans.
the
answer
in
my
print
is,
this
is
correct,
it
should
be,
this
is
not
correct.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
the
federal
judge
whatever
had
no
jurisdiction
under
any
circumstances
because
i
might
point
out
that
certainly
the
records
--
mr.
roger
robb
when
they
were
brought
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
our
friends
have
demonstrated
were
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
state
district
court
for
this
district
and
i
assume
that
that
was
known
to
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
across
the
state
line,
yes.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
he
said
that
he
--
he
said
frankly,
that
was
in
his
mind
that
if
anybody
who
is
going
to
get
sued
it
was
going
to
be
he
and
senator
--
him
and
senator
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
he
could
be
sued
here
of
course.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
yes
sir.
he
is
sued
here.
mr.
roger
robb
now,
i
might
say
yes,
that
is
--
that's
one
thing
we're
sure
of.
i
might
say
also,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
we
submit
that
this
action
which
occurred
three
weeks
after
the
arrest
and
the
search
and
the
seizures
which
are
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
which
are
the
gist
to
that
action.
these
--
these
are
action
in
moving
the
records
across
the
state
line.
it
seems
to
us
it's
hardly
enough
to
cast
any
substantial
doubt
on
the
uncontradicted
proof
that
senator
eastland
and
mr.
sourwine
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
previous
seizure
of
the
records.
this
is
not
a
lawsuit
for
moving
records
across
the
state
line.
it's
a
lawsuit
for
conspiring
to
bring
about
unlawful
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
roger
robb
i
know.
mr.
roger
robb
as
i
understand
their
complaint,
your
honor,
their
complaint
is
that
--
that
they
alleged
that
this
taking
of
the
records
across
the
state
line
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy.
not
that
it
was
an
independent
substantive
cause
of
action.
it
was
all
part
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
that
this
is
--
mr.
roger
robb
if
this
is
his
theory,
it's
a
new
theory
that
i
never
heard
before
because
along
this
brief
--
mr.
roger
robb
now,
i
might
add
that
the
--
the
affidavits
of
mr.
sourwine's
deposition
were
not
mere
naked
denials
as
our
friend
suggest
but
they
were
detailed
in
circumstantial
statements
by
everybody
who
had
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
reciting
exactly
of
what
the
relevant
actions
and
statements
of
those
people
had
been.
and
the
evidence
produced
by
our
respondents
was
uncontradicted.
the
petitioners
do
not
traverse
a
single
fact
that
we
relied
upon
except
for
taking
mr.
sourwine's
deposition,
they
made
no
attempt
to
use
the
federal
discovery
procedure.
they
did
not
impeach
any
of
our
witnesses
or
attempt
to
do
so.
and
i
might
point
out
that
pursuant
to
the
rule
9h
of
the
district
court,
our
respondents
filed
with
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
statement
of
the
material
facts
as
to
which
they
contended,
there
was
no
issue.
their
statement
is
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
83
and
recites
in
summary
form
the
facts
that
i
have
mentioned
here
today.
paragraph
43
of
that
statement
recites
that
neither
senator
eastland
nor
mr.
sourwine
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
acquisition
of
the
scef
material
by
the
joint
committee
or
with
the
preparation,
issuance
or
execution
of
the
arrest
and
search
warrants
where
under
the
joint
committee
obtained
the
material
to
scef.
now,
rule
9h
provides
that
the
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
may
assume
that
the
facts
recited
in
such
a
statement
are
admitted
unless
they
are
controverted
by
opposing
statements
and
the
petitioners
filed
no
such
opposing
statement.
in
short,
we
submit
and
we
have
shown
--
we
showed
by
uncontradicted
proof
that
the
conspiracy
upon
which
this
suit
is
rested,
never
existed
that
the
petitioners
introduced
no
evidence
casting
a
doubt
upon
the
showing
we
made
nor
have
they
demonstrated
any
possibility
that
in
the
event
of
a
trial,
they
could
produce
such
evidence.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
that's
what
they
say,
your
honor.
but
i
submit
that
you're
not
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
on
a
mere
gossamer
--
gossamer
web
of
suspicion
which
we've
done
an
amount
to
prove
it
all.
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
the
federal
courts
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
on
that
point
that
one
of
the
leading
cases
as
taken
by
judge
learned
hand
which
he
said
about
what
i've
just
said
although
in
better
language.
that's
our
answer.
now,
returning
to
the
second
branch
of
our
argument
and
to
be
a
matter
of
legislative
immunity
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
only
acts
charged
against
the
respondents
in
connection
with
this
alleged
conspiracy
with
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
for
the
scef
records
and
moving
of
the
records
to
washington
and
this
conduct,
we
submit,
was
well
within
the
scope
of
the
official
duties
of
the
respondent
and
was
therefore
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
of
the
constitution.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
great
case
of
kilbourn
against
thompson,
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
conferred
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
to
support
the
rights
of
the
people
or
enabling
their
representatives
to
execute
the
functions
of
their
office
without
fear
of
prosecutions,
civil
or
criminal.
last
time
in
the
johnson
case,
this
court
said
the
privilege
will
be
read
broadly
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
accordingly,
and
we
have
seen
from
the
cases,
the
privilege
is
not
limited
to
speech
or
debate
strictly
as
such
but
attaches
to
all
things
that
are
generally
done
in
the
session
of
the
house
by
one
of
its
members
on
the
business
before
it
and
this
includes
investigation
of
outstanding
committees
or
special
committees.
and
as
the
court
has
held
or
said
in
several
cases,
tenney
against
brandhove
and
the
johnson
case,
this
privilege
is
not
destroyed
by
allegations
of
proof
of
illegality
or
claim
of
non-worthy
purpose.
it
protects
the
legislator
so
long
as
he
acts
in
a
field
where
a
legislator
traditionally
have
the
power
to
act
and
is
lost
only
when
the
acts
of
the
legislator
are
nowise
related
to
the
due
functioning
of
the
legislative
process.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
it
does.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
i
think
it
should
and
does,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
we
rely
upon,
so
far
as
senator
eastland
is
concerned,
we
think
the
issuance
of
this
subpoena,
these
subpoenas
was
clearly
within
the
legitimate
sphere
of
his
legislative
activities
and
duties.
we
think
that
the
activity
of
mr.
--
mr.
roger
robb
legislative
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
no.
mr.
roger
robb
--
is
that
it?
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
your
honor.
but
there
isn't
any
issue
of
the
fact
by
us
admitting
that
everything
he
did
was
in
this
capacity.
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
we
follow
from
this,
if
it
please
your
honor,
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
barr
case
and
other
case
as
howard
case,
a
committee
on
executive
must
acts
through
agents
and
assistance
and
counsel.
this
is
a
necessary
corollary
of
the
function
of
the
government.
and
since
this
is
true
and
we
submit
that
since
the
must
of
necessity
be
a
delegation
of
duties
and
deciding
by
legislators
as
well
as
executive,
we
submit
that
the
agent
of
the
legislator
should
partake
of
the
same
privilege
of
immunity
which
the
legislator
has.
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
say
partly
by
the
general
doctrine
although
it's
six
and
one
and
a
half
does
in
the
other--
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
i
think.
mr.
roger
robb
but
i
think
it
would
be
anomalous,
may
it
please
your
honor,
to
hold
that
the
deputy
or
ranked
administrator
which
i
think
with
mr.
barr's
provision
--
mr.
roger
robb
--
would
be
immune
whereas
the
general
counsel
of
the
congressional
committee
was
not.
mr.
roger
robb
--
damages
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
damages.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
i
think
it
will
be
anomalous
to
hold
that
the
deputy
marshal
who
served
the
subpoena
issued
by
the
court
would
be
immune
and
there
are
such
cases
even
though
the
subpoenas
are
invalid.
subpoena
are
served
the
process
issued
by
the
court
would
be
immune
but
a
counsel
of
the
same
committee
who
served
the
similar
subpoena
would
have
to
respond
in
damages.
i
think
the
same
principle
works
in
both
cases,
applies
in
both
cases.
now
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
i
said
that
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
if
i
--
if
can't
entirely
understand
that
except
that
for
a
--
it
says
that
the
privilege
extended
to
a
legislator
is
entitled
to
a
greater
respect
and
not
extend
it
a
subordinate.
i
don't
conceive
that
that
says
that
the
subordinate
has
no
privilege.
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
robb
i
can
see
how,
may
it
please
your
honor,
if
you
took
this
hypothetical
question,
i
take
it
that
for
a
no
speech
made
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
could
a
senator
or
a
member
of
the
house
be
sued
and
have
to
respond
in
damages
for
libel
in
those
cases.
however,
i
can
conceive
of
a
press
release
or
speech
issued
by
some
subordinate
which
so
far
departed
from
the
scope
of
his
appropriate
duties
that
he
might
be
liable
to
damages.
and
i
think
perhaps
that's
what
the
court
is
talking
about.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
if
that's
what
you
had,
may
it
please
your
honor
in
the
wheeldin
case,
wheelding
against
wheeler.
wheeler
issued
a
subpoena
on
his
own
without
any
authority
from
anybody,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
or
anybody
else
and
he
was
held
liable
whereas
in
our
case,
we
don't
have
that
situation.
of
course,
in
the
kilbourn
case.
in
the
kilbourn
case,
the
court
held
i
think
--
and
i
think
the
plain
intendment
of
the
court's
decision
was
perhaps
the
members
of
the
committee
and
who
had
kilbourn
held
in
contempt
actively
participate
in
his
arrest.
they
--
they
would
have
been
liable.
but
everything
they
did
was
within
the
scope
of
their
legislative
functions.
therefore,
they
were
not
liable.
now,
we
say
here
everything
that
senator
eastland
did
and
mr.
sourwine
did,
came
within
the
scope
of
their
legislative
functions.
let
me
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear.
if
i
wasn't
sure
from
mr.
kinoy's
argument
on
whether
he
was
suggesting
and
i
was
contended
that
there's
a
proper
function
for
unanimous
state
center
or
counsel
for
senate
committee
to
go
out
and
make
illegal
arrest,
searches
and
seizures,
i'm
contending
no
such
thing.
i
certainly
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
contend
that
there's
such
a
thing.
this
is
obviously
not
a
legislative
function.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
roger
robb
oh!
certainly.
and
i
don't
think,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
you
can
reason
ex
post
facto
so
to
speak
and
because
--
because
mr.
sourwine
and
the
committee
took
over
these
papers
after
the
raid
that
therefore
they
must
be
held
responsible
for
whatever
happened
on
the
raid.
mr.
roger
robb
precisely.
but
--
but
--
mr.
roger
robb
precisely.
but
the
gist
of
the
complaint
is
that
they
participated
in
the
conspiracy
to
make
the
raid.
and
this
happened
after
the
raid.
now,
the
petitioners
have
not
produced
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
these
--
these
respondents
knew
anything
about
the
raid,
had
anything
to
do
it.
and
they
won't
be
able
to
produce
any
such
evidence
on
trial.
they
may
hope
to
but
--
but
they've
had
every
opportunity
to
do
so.
now,
there
were
some
reference
made
in
taking
senator
keating's
deposition
and
that
mr.
kinoy
came
into
court
the
day
of
the
argument
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
letter
from
senator
keating
which
is
in
the
record
here
which
--
in
which
he
protested
against
the
--
that
issuance
of
these
subpoenas
and
appeared
to
mr.
kinoy
and
his
co-counsel
had
known
about
this
for
weeks
and
haven't
done
anything
about
it.
in
any
event,
the
letter
is
completely
irrelevant.
these
petitioners
had
every
opportunity
to
explore,
to
take
depositions,
and
to
get
--
and
to
bring
in
evidence
but
they
brought
in
nothing
whatever
to
contravene
all
statements
of
facts.
on
these
grounds,
may
it
please
the
court,
first
that
the
uncontradicted
proof
shows
that
these
petitioners
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
conspiracy
which
is
the
gist
of
their
case
and
second,
that
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
and
the
taking
of
the
records
to
washington
pursuant
to
those
subpoenas
was
well
within
the
legitimate
scope
of
their
legislative
duties
and
therefore
privileged,
we
submit
that
the
court
ought
to
be
affirmed,
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
