mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
aim
in
this
matter
is
to
define
electronic
eavesdropping
as
a
search
and
seizure,
subject
to
the
control
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
capable
of
judicial
regulation
there
under
as
any
other
search
and
seizure.
we
believe
that
in
electronic
eavesdropping
under
the
fourth
amendment
there
can
be
lawful
means
of
acquiring
evidence
when
it
is
executed
and
carried
out
in
conformity
with
traditional
fourth
amendment
regulations.
it
should
not
be
too
difficult
to
define
it
as
a
search
and
seizure.
this
court
has
already
regarded
it
as
a
fourth
amendment
question
in
another
context
in
the
silverman
case.
indeed
it
is
strongly
analogous
to
conventional
search
and
seizure
for
tangible
objects,
a
primary
difference
being
that
what
is
sought
in
the
case
of
an
eavesdrop
is
words
or
speech.
indeed,
this
is
not
so
different
from
a
conventional
search
and
seizure
when
the
object
of
that
search
is
also
words
recorded
in
the
nature
of
invoices,
checks,
bills,
and
so
forth.
this
is
indeed
a
more
sophisticated
means
of
search
and
seizure.
as
our
economy
and
culture
has
grown
more
sophisticated
so
have
our
devices
of
law
enforcement.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
it
is
--
it
is
our
contention
--
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
not
a
means
for
compelling
self-incriminatory
statements.
mr.
richard
uviller
a
search
warrant
in
our
view
is
not
a
compulsory
document
in
the
same
sense
as
a
subpoena
either.
i
--
i'm
aware
justice
fortas
of
the
boyd
doctrine
in
which
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendments
are
in
a
sense
blended
and
indeed
in
that
era
and
in
the
emerging
understanding
of
civil
liberties
protected
by
these
amendments,
there
was
some
language
about
the
compulsion
of
a
search
and
seizure
or
of
a
search
warrant.
i
suggest
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
place
in
our
contemporary
understanding
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
has
no
place
in
a
search
and
seizure
situation.
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
place
where
the
search
and
seizures
where
incriminating
evidence
obtained
from
the
person.
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
place
where
it
is
for
physical
substance
such
as
a
man's
blood
obtained
from
the
person.
was
there
a
compulsion
when
blood
was
taken
in
schmerber?
i
should
say
that
there
was
the
most
oblivious
sort
of
compulsion
in
the
sense
that
a
man
against
his
will
was
held
down
while
his
veins
were
pierced.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
i
think
that
schmerber
is
--
is
enlightening
in
this
regard,
justice
fortas.
i
do
not
rely
upon
it
entirely
because
i
do
think
that
boyd
or
gouled
decision
has
today
the
respectability
of
the
--
of
one
of
the
federalist
papers.
i
mean
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
an
advocate
to
address
critical
remarks
to
the
boyd
decision.
i
do
feel
in
all
candor
that
there
might
maybe
some
reverence
attributed
to
that
opinion
which
is
not
fully
deserved.
and
--
when
i
--
i
mean
to
discuss
mere
evidence,
although
it
was
quite
fully
and
very
interestingly
discussed
yesterday.
i
still
think
that
i
cannot
succeed
here
unless
i
can
persuade
the
court
that
the
gouled
rule
and
to
the
extent
that
the
gouled
rule
relies
upon
boyd
should
be
no
longer
followed.
it
should
be
disregarded.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
majority
opinion;
i
--
i
see
boyd
and
this
is
really
essential
to
my
argument,
justice
black,
i
see
boyd
for
all
that
it
does
express
some
very
important
principles
which
have
contributed
to
the
growth
of
civil
liberties
in
this
country
and
i
can
well
understand
how
such
a
man
as
justice
brandeis
would
have
appraised
it
as
highly
as
he
did.
but
i
see
boyd
at
heart
as
a
property
founded
decision.
i
see
the
essence
and
heart
of
the
--
of
boyd
decision
as
entick
against
carrington.
and
entick
against
carrington
as
being
a
trespass
decision,
a
decision
which
does
not
hold
up
with
pride,
the
right
of
the
individual
to
be
secure
and
private
in
his
thoughts
and
deeds
from
the
intrusion
of
government,
but
a
decision
which
holds
up
consistent
with
the
english
in
early
american
policy
which
holds
up
the
right
to
property
as
the
superior
right
and
all
else
follows
there
from.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
fifth
amendment
is
for
--
mr.
richard
uviller
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment
in
boyd
and
the
similar
privilege
as
mentioned
in
entick,
it
seems
to
me
was
brought
in
almost
by
the
way.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
really
pertains
to
a
search
and
seizure.
it's
not
just
schmerber.
it's
because
the
two
are
very
different,
the
fifth
and
the
fourth.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
justice,
every
piece
of
evidence
that
is
obtained
is
incriminatory.
i
mean
by
definition,
everything
that
is
search
and
seizure
seeks
and
obtains
as
incriminating
evidence.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
have
--
mr.
richard
uviller
justice
fortas
the
court
found
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
there
was
no
compulsion
in
osborn
and
in
hoffa
despite
the
fact
that
that
very
situation
pertained
there.
unknown
to
him,
he
was
talking
to
a
police
agent
and
there
was
no
compulsion
specifically
so
found.
mr.
richard
uviller
why
--
well,
but
is
it
as
far
as
compulsion
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
richard
uviller
no
mr.
pardon
no
mr.
vic
in
this
case.
mr.
pardon
and
mr.
fit
vic
a
little
microphone
fixed
to
the
wall,
but
as
far
as
compulsion
is
concerned
is
there
any
greater
degree
of
compulsion
when
two
people
talk
in
their
office
overheard
by
a
microphone
and
when
two
people
talk
in
an
office
overheard
by
a
recording
device
on
one
of
them.
i
say
that
to
bring
compulsion
into
the
fourth
amendment,
the
miranda
case
mr.
justice
douglas,
i've
read
and
reread
and
i
think
the
court
went
to
considerable
lengths
in
that
case
to
explain
just
why
they
felt
that
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
coercion
inherent
in
certain
types
of
interrogation.
and
i'm
–
and
if
we
read
the
court's
intend
to
that
decision
correctly.
we
believe
that
those
conditions
must
exist
before
there
is
compulsion.
simply
the
conversation
between
a
police
officer
whether
he'd
be
obvious
and
open,
or
whether
he's
then
be
concealed
does
not
have
in
it
that
sort
of
compulsion
which
brought
the
fifth
amendment
into
plain
random.
mr.
richard
uviller
well
justice
douglas
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
–
would
make
a
distinction
between
subpoena
and
warrant.
now
in
boyd
they
were
--
they
were
--
they
were
joined
together
although
that
was
indeed
it
seems
to
me
a
subpoena
type
of
statute.
in
a
subpoena
the
defendant
is
required
to
bring
forth
the
incriminating
evidence
against
himself
and
in
effect
connect
it
to
himself
by
authenticating
it,
that
characterizes
a
subpoena.
in
a
warrant
situation,
not
only
does
the
accused
not
have
to
do
anything
himself
but
he
is
required
to
do
nothing.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
i
would
assume
the
police
would
take
such
measures
and
it's
necessary
to
carry
out
the
order
of
the
court.
but
that
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
richard
uviller
correct.
it
does
not
compel
self-incriminatory
statements
from
the
man
anymore.
mr.
richard
uviller
that's
correct,
sir.
exactly
the
way
if
a
court
--
justice
fortas,
if
a
court
orders
a
man's
arrest
on
probable
cause
by
warrant,
that
man
is
required
to
submit
to
that
arrest
because
the
court
had
ordered
it.
is
that
an
invasion
of
his
privacy?
it
seems
to
me
that
an
arrest
is
at
least
created
an
invasion
of
a
man's
privacy.
he's
listening
to
what
maybe
said
in
his
office.
if
he
is
--
if
that
can
be
ordered
by
a
court
on
probable
cause,
then
cannot
a
--
all
--
all
investigations
every
aspect
of
the
--
of
a
criminal
prosecution
from
the
stand
--
from
the
point
of
getting
the
evidence,
the
point
of
getting
the
defense.
mr.
richard
uviller
justice
fortas,
there
maybe
misunderstanding
here
but
i
read
the
implication
of
what
you
said
to
me.
that
anytime
the
search
warrant
for
a
gun
is
issued
by
a
court
and
a
defendant
is
required
to
yield
that
gun
pursuant
to
that
search
warrant
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
uviller
well
perhaps
if
i
may,
justice
fortas,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
use
of
the
word
trespass.
that
word
is
used
frequently
by
my
adversary
and
indeed
it's
used
frequently
in
this
connection
generally.
by
a
trespass,
i
understand
an
unauthorized,
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
either
a
man's
premises
or
some
other
aspect
of
his
private
life.
to
use
the
term
trespass
where
we
are
talking
about
a
surveillance
pursuant
to
a
court
order
issued
on
probable
cause
seems
to
me
to
be
a
confusion
of
the
issue
and
a
misuse
of
the
term
trespass.
i
don't
that
this
can
be
called
a
trespassory
eavesdrop
--
mr.
richard
uviller
any
device
i'm
quite
sure
of.
mr.
richard
uviller
well
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
positively
because
once
the
court
order
--
order
autho
--
specifically
authorizes
the
intrusion
and
it
seems
to
me
that
can
be
no
longer
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes
sir
and
i
--
and
i
certainly
cannot
point
any
language
in
the
order
that
specifically
authorizes
them
the
means
of
placing
the
instrument
within
the
order
--
the
order
in
point
of
fact
takes
the
act.
mr.
richard
uviller
without
the
order
it
could
be
--
it
would
be
a
crime.
mr.
richard
uviller
there
is
the
--
there
will
be
the
crime
of
eavesdropping.
but
the
--
there
would
be
also
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
they
didn't
break
the
door
down
because
they
didn't
want
to
leave
any
traces
of
having
been
there.
[laughter]
and
they
didn't
have
a
key
for
the
same
reason,
so
they
obtained
entrance
into
a
locked
room
without
a
key
and
without
force.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes
--
well,
entick
was
a
--
yes,
i
guess
it
was.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
indeed
--
mr.
richard
uviller
it
certainly
would
be
a
trespass
but
for
the
warrant.
i
mean,
it
would
be
the
clearest
sort
of
trespass
but
for
the
warrant.
there's
no
question
about
it.
i
go
further
than
that
and
i
was
about
to
say
it
would
be
a
crime
because
new
york
does
make
this
action
a
felony.
the
felony
of
eavesdropping,
a
statute
which
is
enforced
and
which
people
have
been
indicted
and
this
by
authorizing
the
overhearing
and
interception,
and
recording,
takes
the
action
out
of
the
ambit
738
of
the
crime.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
limitations
are
i
am
suggesting
justice
brennan
are
the
fourth
amendment
limitations
which
to
me
--
mr.
richard
uviller
could
it?
yes,
sir.
it
certainly
could.
however,
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
fourth
amendment
requirements
followed
and
what
that
means
to
me,
are
these
--
these
conditions.
one
that
it
would
have
to
be
probable
cause
to
believe
that
evidence
of
crime
could
be
obtained
in
this
manner
and
that
is
the
basic
fourth
amendment
foundation
it
seems
to
me
for
one.
second,
the
order
would
have
to
be
specific
and
particularized
the
place
in
which
it
could
occur
--
could
occur
which
is
again
fourth
amendment
and
the
thing
to
be
seized
--
now
this
it
seems
to
me
is
--
that's
one
of
my
most
difficult
hurdles
here.
if
i
am
going
to
try
to
analogize
electronic
surveillance
and
the
search
for
and
seizure
of
words,
spoken
words
with
a
search
for
tangibles,
we
may
--
we
must
define
what
we
mean
by
the
seizure
of
the
thing
of
--
in
as
much
as
if
that
is
incapable
of
particularization
as
is
alleged
here
then
we
cannot
bring
this
within
the
permissive
as
well
as
the
prohibitive
features
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
uviller
would
be
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
see
that
that
is
a
significant
distinction
in
the
sense
that,
a
man
who
goes
in
with
the
minifon
face
the
facts,
may
also
record
other
things.
the
man
gets
on
the
telephone
and
talks
to
someone
else
and
so
on.
i
think
the
principal
difference
is
that
there's
no
search
in
the
minifon
situation.
it's
just
a
conversation
preserved
by
a
memory
device,
electronic
memory
devices.
in
the
search,
in
bringing
electronic
surveillance
within
the
search,
i
have
no
difficulty
with
its
generality
because
it
seems
to
me
a
search
is
inherently
invites
nature
general.
if
the
search
can
be
defined
as
the
use
of
the
senses
to
perceive,
to
perceive
in
the
quest
for
a
particularly
designated
object,
then
clearly
a
search
for
tangible
objects
is
necessarily
general
and
it
perceives
the
innocuous
along
with
the
--
with
the
guilty.
it
perceives
the
mere
along
with
the
other
or
non-evidence.
it
perceives
everything
that
comes
in
the
natural
range
of
the
particular
sense
of
human
faculty
that's
being
employed
for
the
search.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
an
electronic
eavesdrop
also
perceives
the
innocuous,
perceives
the
irrelevant
to
its
object,
if
you
will,
does
not
invalidate
it
either
from
a
--
from
the
standpoint
of
an
analogy
with
conventional
search
and
seizure
or
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
that
then
i
think
justice
brennan
is
another
question.
this
--
this
court
has
indicated,
i
think
there's
a
conflict
between
harrison
and
millard
in
this
situation
which
you
can
only
seize
what
you
can
thought
what
is
specified
in
the
warrant.
and
if
you're
search
had
uncovered
something
else,
you
cannot
obtain
it.
a
string
of
lower
court
cases
which
i've
cited
in
the
brief,
indicate
the
contrary
have
said
that
once
a
police
officer
is
lawfully
on
the
premises
for
one
reason
or
another
either
executing
a
lawful
warrant
or
for
some
other
reason,
he
does
not
have
to
close
his
eyes
to
incriminating
evidence
that
falls
within
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that's
another
case.
and
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
new
york
is
already
acting
on
that
in
this
other
case.
mr.
richard
uviller
people
against
gandiffier
and
grossman,
the
trial
court
reversed
on
that
ground
among
the
others
and
it
was
reversed
by
the
appellant
division
and
the
conviction
was
sustained
on
the
grounds
that
the
order
being
legal
initially
what
was
perceived
during
the
course
of
it
relating
to
the
commission
of
another
crime
did
not
have
to
be
disregarded
by
the
police.
there's
a
conflict
on
what
to
do
if
you
discover
evidence
of
a
different
crime
and
the
one
you're
looking
for,
and
that
conflict
is
true
on
--
on
conventional
search
cases.
mr.
richard
uviller
it
does
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
selective
service.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
and
the
conviction
was
upheld
and
that
case
conflicts
i
think
with
maryland.
but
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
but
there's
--
mr.
richard
uviller
as
there
--
i
suggest
that
the
harris
rule
is
the
sound
of
one
as
far
as
this
is
concerned.
the
generality
of
the
search
then
is
controlled
by
the
fourth
amendment
only
as
to
place.
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
limiting
the
search
as
distinct
from
the
seizure
limits
it
only
as
to
place,
not
as
to
thing.
and
i
think
that
this
is
rational
and
reasonable
as
i
have
said
because
the
search
naturally
perceives
more
than
the
designated
project.
as
to
the
seizure
however,
the
thing
must
be
designated
and
this
is
to
somewhat
difficult
--
mr.
richard
uviller
is
anything
seized?
i
--
i
would
say
yes,
justice
white
and
my
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
fixing
the
point
at
which
it
occurs
but
i
believe
there
is
the
seizure.
and
i
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
seizure
occurs
at
some
point
beyond
the
mere
perception
because
i
defined
the
perception
of
the
search.
i
think
again,
there's
an
analogy
which
is
already
helpful
to
protect
--
mr.
richard
uviller
if
there
wasn't
any
seizure
then
you
either
have
nothing
or
a
crime.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
a
problem
with
an
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
richard
uviller
because
nothing
has
been
offered
in
any
trial.
mr.
richard
uviller
if
it
comes
under
the
fourth
amendment,
it
does
--
i've
--
in
conventional
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
think
your
honor
is
referring
to
those
cases,
in
which
there
was
no
physical
possession
obtained
in
the
article,
but
there
was
subsequent
testimony
in
court
relating
to
the
article
that
was
seen.
i
would
suggest
that
rather
than
that
being
the
case
of
no
seizure,
that
was
a
case
of
constructive
seizure
because
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
search
and
seizure,
it
doesn't
prohibit
search.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
alright.
perhaps
it's
a
seizure
--
mr.
richard
uviller
perhaps
it's
a
--
it's
a
semantic
problem
only.
i
--
i
am
struggling
to
define
seizure
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
--
there
can
be
an
exclusionary
rule
brought
to
bear
upon
the
obtaining
of
oral
evidence
outside
the
scope
of
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
uviller
it's
something
of
that
sort.
i
--
i
would
choose
to
call
that
a
seizure
but
it
--
i'd
be
perfectly
willing
to
yield
on
that
the
call
it
just
an
aspect
of
the
subpoena
--
the
use
of
the
fruits
of
a
search.
but
indeed
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
insofar
as
the
exclusionary
rule
--
mr.
richard
uviller
it's
difficult
--
i
would
--
i
would
suppose
the
same,
but
it's
difficult
to
see
what
the
enforcement
for
an
unlawful
search
without
a
seizure
could
be
--
mr.
richard
uviller
but
well
--
yes.
the
fourth
amendment
of
course
doesn't
do
that.
i
mean,
we
--
local
statutes
prohibit
trespass,
prohibit
--
we
specifically
prohibit
search
by
electronic
means
whether
it
be
wiretap
or
eavesdrop
and
that
seems
to
me
is
a
local
police
regulations,
it's
a
statute.
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes.
i'm
--
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
perhaps
so.
i
--
it's
certainly
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
but
a
right
of
the
civil
action
for
trespass
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
then
he
would
be
sued
pursuant
to
a
statute.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
don't
know
how
i
got
into
this
jam.[laughter]
i
hold
no
brief
for
this
position
and
i'm
happy
to
accept
the
search
without
the
seizure
on
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
the
serious
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
particular
device,
this
particular
means
of
obtaining
a
search
and
seizure
or
search
or
seizure
is
inherently
beyond
the
control
of
the
fourth
amendment.
are
there
aspects
to
this
particular
variety
of
the
acquisition
or
method
of
acquisition
of
evidence
in
criminal
case
which
inherently
place
some
beyond
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
first
of
these
of
course
to
be
overcome
is
the
so-called
the
“evidence
rule”.
we've
devoted
considerable
time
in
our
brief
to
our
view
of
the
mere
evidence
rule
and
its
contemporary
viability.
it
is
no
great
art
to
cite
numerous
authorities
from
this
court
and
other
scholarly
sources
as
to
the
contemporary
lack
of
reason
or
rationale
for
the
exclusion
of
evidence
because
it
is
of
an
evidential
value
only.
the
concept
of
evidential
value
only
or
mere
evidence,
it
strikes
me,
has
little
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment,
i
should
think
authorizes,
authorizes
permits
the
acquisition
of
evidence
which
is
of
an
incriminatory
nature
for
the
purpose
of
use
as
evidence.
we're
not
now
talking
about
a
trespass.
we're
not
now
talking
about
the
trespass
upon
a
man's
right
to
hold
his
plot
of
ground
secure
against
the
footsteps
of
the
king's
officers.
we're
talking
about
a
right
which
is
much
more
intangible
and
much
more
precious
if
you
will
right
than
not
which
is
the
right
to
privacy
itself.
now,
the
right
to
privacy
is
as
much
invaded
by
a
search
for
contraband
as
it
is
by
a
search
for
mere
evidence.
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
discussing
the
gouled
case
and
the
mere
evidence
rule,
i
should
make
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
have
quarrel
with
the
--
a
proposition
for
which
gouled
has
been
repeatedly
cited
by
this
court
even
during
this
term.
and
that
is,
that
an
entry
by
deception
is
for
the
--
it's
for
the
fourth
amendment
purposes
equivalent
to
an
entry
by
force.
when
we
speak
--
mr.
richard
uviller
equivalent
to
an
entry
by
force.
when
we
speak
of
overruling
gouled,
naturally
i'm
speaking
only
about
aspect
of
gouled
which
says
that,
you
cannot
obtain
a
warrant
for
matters
of
evidentiary
value
only.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
it
would
be
overruling
quite
a
lot
mr.
justice
but
it
would
also
be
consistent
with
quite
a
lot.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
its
own
decisions
had
very
frequently
ignored
the
so-called
mere
evidence
aspect
of
the
gouled
rule
either
by
not
citing
gouled
at
all
or
in
many
instances
by
what
i
think
is
a
distortion
of
the
meaning
of
gouled
and
that
is
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir
and
that
is
by
the
construction
of
instrumentality
to
be
so
broad
that
in
fact
it
includes
what
i
would
consider
more
realistically
speaking
mere
evidence.
indeed
i
could
argue
here
for
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
mere
evidence
rule
of
gouled
by
simply
noting
that
the
conversations
in
this
case
were
in
furtherance
of
a
criminal
conspiracy,
a
conspiracy
and
agreement
implies
conversations
between
the
conspirators
and
the
words
used
here
from
furtherance.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
and
as
i
say
mr.
justice,
this
argument
has
been
accepted
in
some
cases
and
rejected
in
others.
in
many
instances
like
osborn
and
hoffa
and
so
forth
words
or
i
could
say
for
example,
that
the
mere
evidence
rule
does
not
apply
to
evidence
seized
from
the
person
for
some
reason
and
i
could
say
that
words
are
necessarily
evidence
seized
from
the
person
and
therefore
exempt
from
the
gouled
proscription.
mr.
richard
uviller
my
understanding
of
it
mr.
justice
is
that
no
warrant
will
issue
and
no
seizure
maybe
had
or
search
may
maybe
conducted
for
matters
or
materials
which
are
of
evidentiary
value
only
and
do
not
fall
into
the
categories
of
the
fruits
of
a
crime,
instrumentalities
of
the
crime,
or
contraband,
including
weapons.
mr.
richard
uviller
in
my
understanding
of
it
mr.
justice,
it
goes
back
further
than
that.
the
medieval
doctrine
of
deo
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
have
thought
that
the
star
chamber
proceedings
used
general
warrants
and
that
these
general
warrants
issued
for
the
seizure
of
contraband
in
the
nature
of
seditious
writings
and
that
indeed
the
mere
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir,
but
the
the
rule
exempting
mere
evidence
from
seizure,
i
would
say
was
not
applicable
to
the
warrants
issued
by
the
star
chamber.
i
should
say
that
the
rule
exempting
--
mr.
richard
uviller
as
i
--
as
i
recall
what
lord
camden
said
in
entick
was
that
the
search
for
private
papers
is
more
heinous
than
the
warrants
issued
by
the
star
chamber
rather
than
stating
that
they
would
be
equivalence.
and
i
think
that
he
based
that
on
the
fact
that
a
search
for
private
papers
that
was
mere
evidence,
but
on
the
fact
that
the
right
to
possession
of
private
papers
was
in
the
person
from
whom
they
were
taken
and
that
this
right
to
possession
made
the
seizure
a
serious
trespass.
i
suggest
that
the
--
the
foundation
of
the
mere
evidence
rule
is
totally
inappropriate
to
rule
of
evidence.
that
it
--
that
it
relates
purely
to
a
question
of,
who
has
the
right
to
possess?
contraband;
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
possess
therefore
it
maybe
seized.
the
instrumentalities
of
a
crime
by
medieval
and
perhaps
even
present
day
thought
become
themselves
somewhat
infected
and
have
to
be
purified
by
the
church
or
state
and
therefore
can
be
seized.
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
yes
and
indeed
in
that
era,
it
appears
that
there
was
--
there
were
safeguards.
the
person
who
owned
the
property
had
to
go
along
with
the
marshal
and
identify
it
as
his
before
it
could
be
seized.
but
i
suggest
that
this
is
all
consistent
with
a
notion
of
property,
who
in
whom
was
the
property
interest?
and
only
--
and
you
could
deprive
a
suspect
of
property
only
if
you
could
show
that
he
did
not
have
a
property
interest
in
it.
i
suggest
today
and
--
and
under
the
fourth
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
i'm
reinterpreting
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that's
the
--
that
it
--
that
it
has
been
reinterpreted
and
i'm
trying
to
restore
to
its
original
interpretation.
our
--
our
--
many
of
our
constitutional
rights
were
founded
on
18th
century
notions
of
private
property
and
have
been
reinterpreted
to
a
more
intangible
and
more
contemporary
notion
of
a
right
to
privacy
that
exists
without
regard
to
whether
one
has
property
seized
or
invaded
in
the
course
of
the
breach
of
the
privacy.
mr.
richard
uviller
may
i
respond
to
that
mr.
justice
by
saying
that
in
our
brief
we
advocate
an
abandonment
of
the
silverman-goldman
distinction.
consistent
with
our
position
that
there
is
a
right
to
privacy
that
it
exists
without
regard
to
the
boundaries
of
physical
property,
we
suggest
that
there
should
be
fourth
amendment
regulation
of
any
search
whether
it
be
by
physical
trespass
or
by
electronic
intrusion.
and
so,
these
magnificent
devices
which
your
honor
referred
to,
which
can
pierce
walls
without
physical
trespass,
should
by
all
rights
come
within
the
regulation
of
the
fourth
amendment
both
as
to
proscription
and
as
to
permissiveness.
and
the
same
standards
which
authorized
the
physical
intrusion
in
the
search
for
evidence
of
a
--
of
a
tangible
nature
should
control
the
search
for
evidence
of
an
oral
nature
whether
or
not
made
by
physical
intrusion.
i
think
that
perhaps
what
we're
tending
toward
here
is
an
underlying
feeling
that
all
who
considered
this
problem
are
confessed
to
and
that
is
that
there
is
somewhere
in
all
of
us
a
deeply
rooted
and
essential
repugnance
for
the
notion
of
the
silent
--
all
of
the
invisible
ear
of
the
state
present
during
what
is
considered
by
most
of
us
to
be
an
extremely
private
and
personal
event,
and
that
is
speech
within
protected
quarters.
certainly,
i
and
we
are
not
immune
from
that
sensation
of
repugnance
and
revulsion
of
for
these
intrusions,
but
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
by
analysis,
all
attempts,
all
efforts
by
law
enforcement
to
enforce
its
laws
inevitably
involved
some
intrusion.
indeed
in
many
instances
of
conventional
searches
not
heretofore
challenged,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
intrusion
is
at
least
as
great
as
that
by
electronic
eavesdrop.
indeed,
it
is
too
final
line
to
draw.
in
irvin
for
example,
there
was
no
order.
the
dirty
business
which
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
in
the
slogan
with
which
we
have
to
contend
in
these
matters
was
not
addressed
to
electronic
surveillance
per
se,
but
it
was
addressed
to
electronic
surveillance
without
prior
mandate
by
court.
in
the
case
of
the
search
for
evidence
and
i
don't
care
now
whether
it
is
by
questioning
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
mr.
justice
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
cognizant
of
that
of
view
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
see
it
that
way
myself
and
i
do
not
--
and
i
argue
for
a
contrary
position.
mr.
richard
uviller
perhaps
so
and
if
so,
if
justice
bradley
in
boyd
meant
to
exempt
private
papers
or
certain
types
of
evidence
like
that
from
the
permissive
aspect
of
the
fourth
amendment,
then
i
suggest
that
he
does
so
without
foundation
in
constitutional
history.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
say
anything
about
the
type
of
evidence
to
be
seized.
it
talks
only
about
the
manner
in
which
a
search
can
be
executed.
and
the
clear
implication
to
me
of
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
if
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
amendment
itself
are
adhered
to,
that
a
warrant
may
issue
for
the
search
and
seizure
of
virtually
anything.
mr.
richard
uviller
there
has
certainly
been
controversy
in
that.
mr.
richard
uviller
that
of
course
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that
is
--
that
is
the
hardest,
the
hardest
and
most
extreme
limit.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
yes
--
well,
i
would
almost
go
so
far
as
to
say,
yes,
if
it
had
been
written
originally
without
compulsion.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
would
have
no
doubt
for
instance
that
letters
confessing
the
crime
could
be
reached
by
a
search
warrant.
i
would
have
no
--
this
is
--
this
is
evidence.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
suppose
you
would
keep
a
copy,
i
--
i
would
think
--
i
think
it
could
be
obtained
against
you.
i
think
its
evidence.
i
think
that
what
we're
dealing
here
is
--
mr.
richard
uviller
no.
i
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
relates
to
every
--
every
instance
in
which
there
was
some
form
of
compulsion
--
mr.
richard
uviller
--
exerted
upon
the
man
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
subpoena
--
the
subpoena
i
say
is
a
special
case.
mr.
richard
uviller
i'm
talking
now
about
--
mr.
richard
uviller
it
was
compelled
at
the
time
it
was
made?
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
then
this
fifth
amendment
question,
a
fifth
amendment
barred.
it
would
have
to
be
freely
made;
free
of
compulsion
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
then
if
it
constitutes
evidence
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
yes,
i
do
think
that
a
subpoena
would
be
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
it's
that
easy.
first
place,
you
would
have
to
show
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
think
there
would
be
no
compulsion
within
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
uviller
no.
at
the
time
of
the
affirmative
act
of
bringing
it
forward
and
identifying
it,
pursuant
to
the
court
order.
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes
--
oh,
you
would
have
to
identify
it.
mr.
richard
uviller
right,
if
he
responds.
mr.
richard
uviller
here
it
is
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
so,
these
are
the
papers
in
my
desk.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
believe
so.
i
believe
he
is
there
for
--
he
is
--
he
is
ordered
to
do
something
which
--
which
links
him
with
the
document
and
therefore
provides
a
link
in
the
--
in
the
incriminating
chain.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
do
think
so
justice
white
and
i
think
so
on
this
basis.
i
think
that
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
do
anything
when
a
search
warrant
is
issued.
indeed,
he
may
not
even
be
present.
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
i
do
either.
i'm
--
i'm
discussing
now
obviously
a
search
and
seizure
for
tangible
evidence
because
i
mean
to
bring
a
search
and
seizure
for
oral
evidence
into
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment
by
analogy.
i
think
for
example
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
without
in
anyway
abandoning
that
position
based
on
the
reasonableness
clause
which
i
would
adhere
to,
what
i'm
arguing
here
is
that
the
order
of
the
court
must
conform
to
the
spirit
of
the
warrant
clause.
and
that
--
that
if
we
are
--
since
we
are
not
allowing,
let
us
say,
eavesdrops
incident
to
an
arrest
or
eavesdrops
necessitated
by
some
sort
of
abstract
of
reasonableness.
but
in
new
york,
we
have
the
statutory
scheme
which
presupposes
a
court
order
and
that
court
order
based
upon
probable
cause,
i
suggest
that
that
statutory
scheme
was
drawn
with
the
warrant
clause
in
mind.
and
that
it
is
--
it
is
the
obedience
to
the
warrant
clause
which
would
justify
the
--
the
813
(c)
scheme.
now,
the
--
the
particular
--
mr.
richard
uviller
about
the
gouled
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well
as
i
said,
i
could
argue
around
gouled.
i
could
say
these
are
instrumentalities.
and
gouled
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that's
the
way
i
felt.
and
they
--
and
i
could
also
argue
that
this
is
from
the
person,
gouled
is
not
applied
to
evidence
from
the
person.
but
i
think
that
the
harder
and
perhaps
the
more
honest
approach
is
to
see
gouled
as
an
obstacle
to
this
position.
i'm
--
i
was
--
i
was
talking
about
the
dissent
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
read
gouled
as
a
--
as
based
on
boyd.
i
think
they
simply
said
in
gouled
that
a
warrant
cannot
issue
for
matters
that
are
of
evidentiary
value
only.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
one
would
have
to
read
between
the
lines
i
think
to
see
it.
i
--
i
would
say
that
certainly
the
idea
of
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
justice
black
that
it
was
of
surreptitious
nature
of
the
seizure
in
the
gouled.
there
--
it
was
a
surreptitious
seizure
but
as
i
read
gouled,
it
wasn't
somewhat
surreptitious
character
of
it
as
the
deception
practice
to
gain
entry
and
access.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that
aspect
of
gouled,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
at
all,
justice
black,
at
all
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
very
clear
--
mr.
richard
uviller
not
--
no,
i
thought
--
i
thought
i
started
this
afternoon
by
saying
that.
when
i
say
overrule
it,
i
do
not
mean
overrule
that
aspect
of
it
that
was
cited
so
frequently
by
this
court
and
which
we
have
no
quarrel
with.
we're
only
talking
about
that
aspect
which
deals
with
the
mere
–
so
called
mere
evidence
rule.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir,
i
am
sir.
the
surreptitious,
let's
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
surreptitious
nature
of
this
type
of
evidence
gathering.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
this
is
surreptitious.
indeed
it
depends
for
its
effectiveness
on
being
surreptitious.
it
could
hardly
be
argued
that
eavesdropping
should
be
permitted
only
if
a
presentation
of
the
order
is
made
to
the
suspect
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bug
is
installed.
it
could
hardly
be
argued
indeed
that
a
public
record
should
be
made
of
the
order
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bug
is
installed.
it
is
by
its
nature
secret.
is
that
secrecy
itself
essentially
repugnant?
it
does
not
offend
fourteenth
amendment
principles
of
due
process.
i
suggest
once
again
that
it
is
nothing
but
another
variety
of
a
very
common
more
enforcement
investigative
technique
and
that
is
surreptitiousness.
let
us
take
for
example
the
simplest
form
which
i
doubt
anyone
could
argue
was
contrary
to
constitutional
principles.
and
that
is
following
a
man,
surveillance
by
keeping
him
in
sight,
and
going
with
him
wherever
he
goes
secretly,
recording
his
movements.
is
that
an
invasion
of
privacy?
it
is,
but
indeed,
there's
not
even
a
requirement
for
a
warrant
for
that.
perhaps,
they
should
be,
but
i
would
suggest
that
with
or
without
a
warrant,
it
has
never
been
challenged
as
a
secret
surveillance
and
an
invasion
of
privacy
because
of
its
secrecy.
this
is
true
indeed
of
many
law
enforcement
techniques,
some
of
which
was
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
this
term
such
as
for
example,
the
purchase
of
narcotics
by
a
person
who
is
masquerading
as
a
narcotics
user.
he
is
a
police
officer.
he
is
secretly
gathering
evidence
by
the
purchase
of
these
narcotics
to
use
against
the
man.
is
the
fact
of
secrecy,
the
fact
of
deception
there
in
and
of
itself
so
essentially
repugnant
to
our
notions
of
liberty
and
privacy
as
to
invalidate
it,
i
think
not.
so
here
too,
i
think
that
the
element
of
secrecy
the
fact
that
the
entry
to
install
a
bug
was
surreptitious
indeed
would
have
been
the
crime
of
burglary,
had
it
not
been
for
the
order.
i
do
not
think
that
in
of
itself
should
warrant
exclusion
of
this
very
valuable
and
important
means
of
obtaining
evidence
otherwise
inaccessible.
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice
i
agree
that
it
should
be
solved.
i
see
no
reason
why
there
should
not
be
a
record
made,
a
public
record
made.
i
see
no
reason
why
the
prevalence
should
not
be
subject
to
legislative
or
executive
inquiry.
indeed
it
would
help
a
great
deal
if
we
knew
just
how
often
these
devices
were
used
and
in
what
sort
of
case,
and
in
what
--
with
what
results.
i
think
there
should
be
such
a
record
made
and
i
think
that
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it
then
some
policy
does.
however
in
new
york,
that
is
in
effect
done
because
the
order
is
a
written
document.
it
is
based
upon
an
affidavit
sworn
to
in
writing.
these
two
documents
are
placed
in
the
records
of
the
court
and
in
the
records
of
the
public
agency
by
which
they
were
acquired.
they
are
subject
to
challenge
and
to
inspection
on
subsequent
occasions
after
the
termination
of
the
investigation
in
question.
indeed,
that
is
how
it
comes
before
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
it
is
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes
sir,
yes,
sir.
in
effect,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
filed
in
that
--
well,
in
effect
in
this
--
in
this
sense,
if
any
evidence
was
obtained
from
this
which
is
going
to
be
use
on
it
or
use
as
leads
to
other
evidence.
then
the
defendant
has
a
motion
to
suppress
that
evidence
during
which
he
challenges
the
underlying
order,
gets
to
see
it
and
read
it
exactly
as
he
would
a
search
warrant.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
have
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
sir.
but
it's
part
of
the
motion
to
suppress
which
lies
to
challenge
--
mr.
richard
uviller
there's
no
statutory
requirement
for
notice
as
to
this.
what
happens
in
--
in
point
of
fact
is
that
an
inquiry
is
made
usually
informal
between
the
parties
and
the
district
attorney
answers
it.
and
the
defendant
then
brings
his
motion
which
is
heard
before
trial
during
which
there
is
full
disclosure.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
can't
really
answer
for
the
other
counties
of
our
state
justice
brennan
except
to
say
that
the
motion
to
suppress
lies
by
state
law
in
all
counties
--
mr.
richard
uviller
--
and
there
must
be
some
sort
of
system
worked
out
county
by
county
by
which
the
defendant
is
given
an
opportunity
to
make
this
motion.
now
it
maybe
for
example
that,
he
might
not
find
out
about
it
until
cross-examination,
but
usually
during
the
trial
if
not
before
the
trial,
he's
going
to
discover
if
he
hasn't
already
been
told
that
such
a
device
has
been
used.
now,
is
it
filed
in
every
case?
it
was
not
filed
in
the
sense
that
there's
any
room
other
than
the
record
room
of
the
district
attorney's
office
in
which
all
of
these
orders
are
placed,
but
as
far
in
the
sense
that
it
becomes
part
of
the
court
record.
now,
the
problems
and
situations
which
i
should
also
mention
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir
mr.
richard
uviller
in
the
circumstances
where
the
case
goes
to
trial.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
where
there
is
either
evidence
directly
from
the
tape
or
obtained
through
the
use
of
the
tape
that
will
be
introduced
against
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
and
that
too,
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
we
have
the
same
poison
fruit
doctrine
there
if
the
order
--
if
the
tape
order
was
not
properly
founded,
that
is
the
eavesdropping
order,
then
any
results,
leads,
information,
witnesses
obtained
through
the
--
through
what
was
overheard
is
subject
to
suppression
as
a
fruit
of
the
poison
tree.
mr.
richard
uviller
by
decision,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
as
to-
as
to
what
was
actually
heard?
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
i
should
say
that
that
--
that
varies,
i
--
i
obviously
would
have
to
because
the
information
is
different
in
every
case.
the
difficulty
is
that
he
may
not
obtain
the
information
that
is
not
to
be
use
against
him,
but
i
should
say
that
that
again
is
similar
to
a
conventional
search
situation
where
everything
that
is
perceived
during
the
course
of
the
search
is
not
subject
to
suppression,
but
only
that
which
is
obtained
for
introduction
in
evidence
and
the
same
thing
pertains
to
evidence
obtained
by
oral
order.
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
i
believe
there
is.
and
i
--
we
have
this
--
the
amicus
is
set
forth
if
your
honor
has
if
the
amicus
attorney
general
of
new
york
has
set
forth
all
the
statutes
in
new
york
dealing
with
this
particular
area.
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
particular
order
and
the
question
of
probable
cause
if
i
may.
here
the
sequence
of
events
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
indicates
that
–
although
there
were
two
eavesdrop
orders
in
question
here;
one
on
an
attorney
named
neyer
and
the
other
on
steinman,
the
results
of
only
the
steinman
evidence
was
used
against
this
defendant.
the
first
one,
neyer,
provided
the
lead
and
indeed
was
referred
to
in
the
affidavit
seeking
the
steinman
order.
however,
as
to
the
neyer
order
and
it
was
not
on
berger's
premises,
berger
the
petitioner
here,
never
spoke
into
that
microphone
or
in
its
vicinity
and
therefore
we
suggest
that
as
to
the
first
order,
this
neyer
order,
berger
is
without
standing
under
the
jones
against
the
united
states
to
contest
the
legality
of
the
order.
true,
that
insofar
as
the
background
of
that
order
became
the
background
for
the
steinman
order,
he
may
contest
that,
but
as
to
the
face
of
the
affidavit
and
whether
it
spelled
that
probable
cause
efficiently
on
the
face
of
the
neyer
affidavit,
i
suggest
that
by
all
conventional
rules,
he
has
no
standing
to
raise
it.
as
to
the
steinman
order
where
he
does
have
--
mr.
richard
uviller
because
there
was
no
--
he's
not
a
party
aggrieved
by
that
search.
he
was
not
one
whose
cartilage
was
invaded,
it
wasn't
his
office,
though,
was
he
there
during
the
--
the
existence
of
the
tap?
nor
was
his
voice
recorded
by
the
eavesdrop.
therefore,
there
was
no
invasion
of
his
right
to
privacy
by
the
tap
on
neyer
--
by
the
bug
in
neyer's
office.
i
suggest
under
jones
that
not
only
must
he
be
the
defendant,
but
he
must
also
be
the
party
whose
constitutional
rights
were
invaded
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
bonafides
of
the
order
under
which
it
was
installed.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
have
a
basis
for
challenging
the
neyer
eavesdrop
insofar
as
it
was
used
to
obtain
the
steinman
eavesdrop
and
indeed
it
was.
the
affidavit
for
the
steinman
drop
referred
to
the
fact
that
matters
have
been
learned
over
the
neyer
eavesdrop,
but
the
only
question
really
on
appraising
the
adequacy
of
an
order
from
a
probable
cause
standpoint,
is
what
did
the
judge
who
signed
the
order,
the
warrant
if
you
will
know
at
the
time
he
signed
it,
and
was
that
which
was
revealed
to
him
sufficient
to
constitute
probable
cause.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
steinman
affidavit.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
there
is
more
than
that.
the
judge
--
unfortunately
the
record
is
not
too
clear
on
this,
but
the
judge
indicated
that
he
had
been
told
various
other
things
by
the
district
attorney
who
presented
that
affidavit
to
him.
and
there
is
some
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
he
was
told
but
unfortunately
neither
the
judge's
minutes
nor
any
papers
were
introduced
to
that
effect,
though,
there
is
evidence
to
amplify
the
steinman
affidavit.
i
suggest
that
in
this
instance
there
is
sufficient
there
to
constitute
probable
cause
and
indeed
--
mr.
richard
uviller
the
steinman
order
mr.
richard
uviller
just
the
affidavit.
mr.
richard
uviller
just
the
affidavit.
now
the
order
itself
that
was
issued
on
steinman
which
is
also
here
for
review,
incorporates
that
affidavit
by
reference
and
i
suggest
that
the
two
have
to
be
read
together.
while
the
order
itself
says,
may
over
hear
and
in
all
conversations
occurring
at
this
place
during
this
period,
it
also
adopts
the
affidavit
itself.
and
reading
with
two
together,
the
order
specifies
the
thing
to
be
seized
and
it
specifies
it
by
referring
to
the
crime
to
which
it
relates.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
is
adequate
specification
in
particularity
in
the
conventional
search
and
seizure
doctrine.
if
you
identify
gambling,
paraphernalia
for
example,
just
simply
by
the
crime
to
which
it
relates
that
is
particularity
for
a
search
warrant
purposes.
and
here,
the
particularity
in
this
order
was
conversations
relating
to
the
transmission
of
bribe
money
to
the
state
liquor
authority
in
a
conspiracy
to
obtain
liquor
licenses
unlawfully
and
to
that
degree
of
specificity
i
suggest
satisfies
conventional
search
and
seizure
requirements.
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
aim
in
this
matter
is
to
define
electronic
eavesdropping
as
a
search
and
seizure,
subject
to
the
control
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
capable
of
judicial
regulation
there
under
as
any
other
search
and
seizure.
we
believe
that
in
electronic
eavesdropping
under
the
fourth
amendment
there
can
be
lawful
means
of
acquiring
evidence
when
it
is
executed
and
carried
out
in
conformity
with
traditional
fourth
amendment
regulations.
it
should
not
be
too
difficult
to
define
it
as
a
search
and
seizure.
this
court
has
already
regarded
it
as
a
fourth
amendment
question
in
another
context
in
the
silverman
case.
indeed
it
is
strongly
analogous
to
conventional
search
and
seizure
for
tangible
objects,
a
primary
difference
being
that
what
is
sought
in
the
case
of
an
eavesdrop
is
words
or
speech.
indeed,
this
is
not
so
different
from
a
conventional
search
and
seizure
when
the
object
of
that
search
is
also
words
recorded
in
the
nature
of
invoices,
checks,
bills,
and
so
forth.
this
is
indeed
a
more
sophisticated
means
of
search
and
seizure.
as
our
economy
and
culture
has
grown
more
sophisticated
so
have
our
devices
of
law
enforcement.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
it
is
--
it
is
our
contention
--
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
not
a
means
for
compelling
self-incriminatory
statements.
mr.
richard
uviller
a
search
warrant
in
our
view
is
not
a
compulsory
document
in
the
same
sense
as
a
subpoena
either.
i
--
i'm
aware
justice
fortas
of
the
boyd
doctrine
in
which
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendments
are
in
a
sense
blended
and
indeed
in
that
era
and
in
the
emerging
understanding
of
civil
liberties
protected
by
these
amendments,
there
was
some
language
about
the
compulsion
of
a
search
and
seizure
or
of
a
search
warrant.
i
suggest
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
place
in
our
contemporary
understanding
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
has
no
place
in
a
search
and
seizure
situation.
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
place
where
the
search
and
seizures
where
incriminating
evidence
obtained
from
the
person.
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
place
where
it
is
for
physical
substance
such
as
a
man's
blood
obtained
from
the
person.
was
there
a
compulsion
when
blood
was
taken
in
schmerber?
i
should
say
that
there
was
the
most
oblivious
sort
of
compulsion
in
the
sense
that
a
man
against
his
will
was
held
down
while
his
veins
were
pierced.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
i
think
that
schmerber
is
--
is
enlightening
in
this
regard,
justice
fortas.
i
do
not
rely
upon
it
entirely
because
i
do
think
that
boyd
or
gouled
decision
has
today
the
respectability
of
the
--
of
one
of
the
federalist
papers.
i
mean
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
an
advocate
to
address
critical
remarks
to
the
boyd
decision.
i
do
feel
in
all
candor
that
there
might
maybe
some
reverence
attributed
to
that
opinion
which
is
not
fully
deserved.
and
--
when
i
--
i
mean
to
discuss
mere
evidence,
although
it
was
quite
fully
and
very
interestingly
discussed
yesterday.
i
still
think
that
i
cannot
succeed
here
unless
i
can
persuade
the
court
that
the
gouled
rule
and
to
the
extent
that
the
gouled
rule
relies
upon
boyd
should
be
no
longer
followed.
it
should
be
disregarded.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
majority
opinion;
i
--
i
see
boyd
and
this
is
really
essential
to
my
argument,
justice
black,
i
see
boyd
for
all
that
it
does
express
some
very
important
principles
which
have
contributed
to
the
growth
of
civil
liberties
in
this
country
and
i
can
well
understand
how
such
a
man
as
justice
brandeis
would
have
appraised
it
as
highly
as
he
did.
but
i
see
boyd
at
heart
as
a
property
founded
decision.
i
see
the
essence
and
heart
of
the
--
of
boyd
decision
as
entick
against
carrington.
and
entick
against
carrington
as
being
a
trespass
decision,
a
decision
which
does
not
hold
up
with
pride,
the
right
of
the
individual
to
be
secure
and
private
in
his
thoughts
and
deeds
from
the
intrusion
of
government,
but
a
decision
which
holds
up
consistent
with
the
english
in
early
american
policy
which
holds
up
the
right
to
property
as
the
superior
right
and
all
else
follows
there
from.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
fifth
amendment
is
for
--
mr.
richard
uviller
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment
in
boyd
and
the
similar
privilege
as
mentioned
in
entick,
it
seems
to
me
was
brought
in
almost
by
the
way.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
really
pertains
to
a
search
and
seizure.
it's
not
just
schmerber.
it's
because
the
two
are
very
different,
the
fifth
and
the
fourth.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
justice,
every
piece
of
evidence
that
is
obtained
is
incriminatory.
i
mean
by
definition,
everything
that
is
search
and
seizure
seeks
and
obtains
as
incriminating
evidence.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
have
--
mr.
richard
uviller
justice
fortas
the
court
found
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
there
was
no
compulsion
in
osborn
and
in
hoffa
despite
the
fact
that
that
very
situation
pertained
there.
unknown
to
him,
he
was
talking
to
a
police
agent
and
there
was
no
compulsion
specifically
so
found.
mr.
richard
uviller
why
--
well,
but
is
it
as
far
as
compulsion
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
richard
uviller
no
mr.
pardon
no
mr.
vic
in
this
case.
mr.
pardon
and
mr.
fit
vic
a
little
microphone
fixed
to
the
wall,
but
as
far
as
compulsion
is
concerned
is
there
any
greater
degree
of
compulsion
when
two
people
talk
in
their
office
overheard
by
a
microphone
and
when
two
people
talk
in
an
office
overheard
by
a
recording
device
on
one
of
them.
i
say
that
to
bring
compulsion
into
the
fourth
amendment,
the
miranda
case
mr.
justice
douglas,
i've
read
and
reread
and
i
think
the
court
went
to
considerable
lengths
in
that
case
to
explain
just
why
they
felt
that
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
coercion
inherent
in
certain
types
of
interrogation.
and
i'm
–
and
if
we
read
the
court's
intend
to
that
decision
correctly.
we
believe
that
those
conditions
must
exist
before
there
is
compulsion.
simply
the
conversation
between
a
police
officer
whether
he'd
be
obvious
and
open,
or
whether
he's
then
be
concealed
does
not
have
in
it
that
sort
of
compulsion
which
brought
the
fifth
amendment
into
plain
random.
mr.
richard
uviller
well
justice
douglas
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
–
would
make
a
distinction
between
subpoena
and
warrant.
now
in
boyd
they
were
--
they
were
--
they
were
joined
together
although
that
was
indeed
it
seems
to
me
a
subpoena
type
of
statute.
in
a
subpoena
the
defendant
is
required
to
bring
forth
the
incriminating
evidence
against
himself
and
in
effect
connect
it
to
himself
by
authenticating
it,
that
characterizes
a
subpoena.
in
a
warrant
situation,
not
only
does
the
accused
not
have
to
do
anything
himself
but
he
is
required
to
do
nothing.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
i
would
assume
the
police
would
take
such
measures
and
it's
necessary
to
carry
out
the
order
of
the
court.
but
that
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
richard
uviller
correct.
it
does
not
compel
self-incriminatory
statements
from
the
man
anymore.
mr.
richard
uviller
that's
correct,
sir.
exactly
the
way
if
a
court
--
justice
fortas,
if
a
court
orders
a
man's
arrest
on
probable
cause
by
warrant,
that
man
is
required
to
submit
to
that
arrest
because
the
court
had
ordered
it.
is
that
an
invasion
of
his
privacy?
it
seems
to
me
that
an
arrest
is
at
least
created
an
invasion
of
a
man's
privacy.
he's
listening
to
what
maybe
said
in
his
office.
if
he
is
--
if
that
can
be
ordered
by
a
court
on
probable
cause,
then
cannot
a
--
all
--
all
investigations
every
aspect
of
the
--
of
a
criminal
prosecution
from
the
stand
--
from
the
point
of
getting
the
evidence,
the
point
of
getting
the
defense.
mr.
richard
uviller
justice
fortas,
there
maybe
misunderstanding
here
but
i
read
the
implication
of
what
you
said
to
me.
that
anytime
the
search
warrant
for
a
gun
is
issued
by
a
court
and
a
defendant
is
required
to
yield
that
gun
pursuant
to
that
search
warrant
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
uviller
well
perhaps
if
i
may,
justice
fortas,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
use
of
the
word
trespass.
that
word
is
used
frequently
by
my
adversary
and
indeed
it's
used
frequently
in
this
connection
generally.
by
a
trespass,
i
understand
an
unauthorized,
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
either
a
man's
premises
or
some
other
aspect
of
his
private
life.
to
use
the
term
trespass
where
we
are
talking
about
a
surveillance
pursuant
to
a
court
order
issued
on
probable
cause
seems
to
me
to
be
a
confusion
of
the
issue
and
a
misuse
of
the
term
trespass.
i
don't
that
this
can
be
called
a
trespassory
eavesdrop
--
mr.
richard
uviller
any
device
i'm
quite
sure
of.
mr.
richard
uviller
well
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
positively
because
once
the
court
order
--
order
autho
--
specifically
authorizes
the
intrusion
and
it
seems
to
me
that
can
be
no
longer
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes
sir
and
i
--
and
i
certainly
cannot
point
any
language
in
the
order
that
specifically
authorizes
them
the
means
of
placing
the
instrument
within
the
order
--
the
order
in
point
of
fact
takes
the
act.
mr.
richard
uviller
without
the
order
it
could
be
--
it
would
be
a
crime.
mr.
richard
uviller
there
is
the
--
there
will
be
the
crime
of
eavesdropping.
but
the
--
there
would
be
also
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
they
didn't
break
the
door
down
because
they
didn't
want
to
leave
any
traces
of
having
been
there.
[laughter]
and
they
didn't
have
a
key
for
the
same
reason,
so
they
obtained
entrance
into
a
locked
room
without
a
key
and
without
force.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes
--
well,
entick
was
a
--
yes,
i
guess
it
was.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
indeed
--
mr.
richard
uviller
it
certainly
would
be
a
trespass
but
for
the
warrant.
i
mean,
it
would
be
the
clearest
sort
of
trespass
but
for
the
warrant.
there's
no
question
about
it.
i
go
further
than
that
and
i
was
about
to
say
it
would
be
a
crime
because
new
york
does
make
this
action
a
felony.
the
felony
of
eavesdropping,
a
statute
which
is
enforced
and
which
people
have
been
indicted
and
this
by
authorizing
the
overhearing
and
interception,
and
recording,
takes
the
action
out
of
the
ambit
738
of
the
crime.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
limitations
are
i
am
suggesting
justice
brennan
are
the
fourth
amendment
limitations
which
to
me
--
mr.
richard
uviller
could
it?
yes,
sir.
it
certainly
could.
however,
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
fourth
amendment
requirements
followed
and
what
that
means
to
me,
are
these
--
these
conditions.
one
that
it
would
have
to
be
probable
cause
to
believe
that
evidence
of
crime
could
be
obtained
in
this
manner
and
that
is
the
basic
fourth
amendment
foundation
it
seems
to
me
for
one.
second,
the
order
would
have
to
be
specific
and
particularized
the
place
in
which
it
could
occur
--
could
occur
which
is
again
fourth
amendment
and
the
thing
to
be
seized
--
now
this
it
seems
to
me
is
--
that's
one
of
my
most
difficult
hurdles
here.
if
i
am
going
to
try
to
analogize
electronic
surveillance
and
the
search
for
and
seizure
of
words,
spoken
words
with
a
search
for
tangibles,
we
may
--
we
must
define
what
we
mean
by
the
seizure
of
the
thing
of
--
in
as
much
as
if
that
is
incapable
of
particularization
as
is
alleged
here
then
we
cannot
bring
this
within
the
permissive
as
well
as
the
prohibitive
features
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
uviller
would
be
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
see
that
that
is
a
significant
distinction
in
the
sense
that,
a
man
who
goes
in
with
the
minifon
face
the
facts,
may
also
record
other
things.
the
man
gets
on
the
telephone
and
talks
to
someone
else
and
so
on.
i
think
the
principal
difference
is
that
there's
no
search
in
the
minifon
situation.
it's
just
a
conversation
preserved
by
a
memory
device,
electronic
memory
devices.
in
the
search,
in
bringing
electronic
surveillance
within
the
search,
i
have
no
difficulty
with
its
generality
because
it
seems
to
me
a
search
is
inherently
invites
nature
general.
if
the
search
can
be
defined
as
the
use
of
the
senses
to
perceive,
to
perceive
in
the
quest
for
a
particularly
designated
object,
then
clearly
a
search
for
tangible
objects
is
necessarily
general
and
it
perceives
the
innocuous
along
with
the
--
with
the
guilty.
it
perceives
the
mere
along
with
the
other
or
non-evidence.
it
perceives
everything
that
comes
in
the
natural
range
of
the
particular
sense
of
human
faculty
that's
being
employed
for
the
search.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
an
electronic
eavesdrop
also
perceives
the
innocuous,
perceives
the
irrelevant
to
its
object,
if
you
will,
does
not
invalidate
it
either
from
a
--
from
the
standpoint
of
an
analogy
with
conventional
search
and
seizure
or
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
that
then
i
think
justice
brennan
is
another
question.
this
--
this
court
has
indicated,
i
think
there's
a
conflict
between
harrison
and
millard
in
this
situation
which
you
can
only
seize
what
you
can
thought
what
is
specified
in
the
warrant.
and
if
you're
search
had
uncovered
something
else,
you
cannot
obtain
it.
a
string
of
lower
court
cases
which
i've
cited
in
the
brief,
indicate
the
contrary
have
said
that
once
a
police
officer
is
lawfully
on
the
premises
for
one
reason
or
another
either
executing
a
lawful
warrant
or
for
some
other
reason,
he
does
not
have
to
close
his
eyes
to
incriminating
evidence
that
falls
within
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that's
another
case.
and
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
new
york
is
already
acting
on
that
in
this
other
case.
mr.
richard
uviller
people
against
gandiffier
and
grossman,
the
trial
court
reversed
on
that
ground
among
the
others
and
it
was
reversed
by
the
appellant
division
and
the
conviction
was
sustained
on
the
grounds
that
the
order
being
legal
initially
what
was
perceived
during
the
course
of
it
relating
to
the
commission
of
another
crime
did
not
have
to
be
disregarded
by
the
police.
there's
a
conflict
on
what
to
do
if
you
discover
evidence
of
a
different
crime
and
the
one
you're
looking
for,
and
that
conflict
is
true
on
--
on
conventional
search
cases.
mr.
richard
uviller
it
does
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
selective
service.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
and
the
conviction
was
upheld
and
that
case
conflicts
i
think
with
maryland.
but
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
but
there's
--
mr.
richard
uviller
as
there
--
i
suggest
that
the
harris
rule
is
the
sound
of
one
as
far
as
this
is
concerned.
the
generality
of
the
search
then
is
controlled
by
the
fourth
amendment
only
as
to
place.
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
limiting
the
search
as
distinct
from
the
seizure
limits
it
only
as
to
place,
not
as
to
thing.
and
i
think
that
this
is
rational
and
reasonable
as
i
have
said
because
the
search
naturally
perceives
more
than
the
designated
project.
as
to
the
seizure
however,
the
thing
must
be
designated
and
this
is
to
somewhat
difficult
--
mr.
richard
uviller
is
anything
seized?
i
--
i
would
say
yes,
justice
white
and
my
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
fixing
the
point
at
which
it
occurs
but
i
believe
there
is
the
seizure.
and
i
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
seizure
occurs
at
some
point
beyond
the
mere
perception
because
i
defined
the
perception
of
the
search.
i
think
again,
there's
an
analogy
which
is
already
helpful
to
protect
--
mr.
richard
uviller
if
there
wasn't
any
seizure
then
you
either
have
nothing
or
a
crime.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
a
problem
with
an
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
richard
uviller
because
nothing
has
been
offered
in
any
trial.
mr.
richard
uviller
if
it
comes
under
the
fourth
amendment,
it
does
--
i've
--
in
conventional
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
think
your
honor
is
referring
to
those
cases,
in
which
there
was
no
physical
possession
obtained
in
the
article,
but
there
was
subsequent
testimony
in
court
relating
to
the
article
that
was
seen.
i
would
suggest
that
rather
than
that
being
the
case
of
no
seizure,
that
was
a
case
of
constructive
seizure
because
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
search
and
seizure,
it
doesn't
prohibit
search.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
alright.
perhaps
it's
a
seizure
--
mr.
richard
uviller
perhaps
it's
a
--
it's
a
semantic
problem
only.
i
--
i
am
struggling
to
define
seizure
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
--
there
can
be
an
exclusionary
rule
brought
to
bear
upon
the
obtaining
of
oral
evidence
outside
the
scope
of
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
uviller
it's
something
of
that
sort.
i
--
i
would
choose
to
call
that
a
seizure
but
it
--
i'd
be
perfectly
willing
to
yield
on
that
the
call
it
just
an
aspect
of
the
subpoena
--
the
use
of
the
fruits
of
a
search.
but
indeed
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
insofar
as
the
exclusionary
rule
--
mr.
richard
uviller
it's
difficult
--
i
would
--
i
would
suppose
the
same,
but
it's
difficult
to
see
what
the
enforcement
for
an
unlawful
search
without
a
seizure
could
be
--
mr.
richard
uviller
but
well
--
yes.
the
fourth
amendment
of
course
doesn't
do
that.
i
mean,
we
--
local
statutes
prohibit
trespass,
prohibit
--
we
specifically
prohibit
search
by
electronic
means
whether
it
be
wiretap
or
eavesdrop
and
that
seems
to
me
is
a
local
police
regulations,
it's
a
statute.
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes.
i'm
--
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
perhaps
so.
i
--
it's
certainly
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
but
a
right
of
the
civil
action
for
trespass
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
then
he
would
be
sued
pursuant
to
a
statute.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
don't
know
how
i
got
into
this
jam.[laughter]
i
hold
no
brief
for
this
position
and
i'm
happy
to
accept
the
search
without
the
seizure
on
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
the
serious
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
particular
device,
this
particular
means
of
obtaining
a
search
and
seizure
or
search
or
seizure
is
inherently
beyond
the
control
of
the
fourth
amendment.
are
there
aspects
to
this
particular
variety
of
the
acquisition
or
method
of
acquisition
of
evidence
in
criminal
case
which
inherently
place
some
beyond
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
first
of
these
of
course
to
be
overcome
is
the
so-called
the
“evidence
rule”.
we've
devoted
considerable
time
in
our
brief
to
our
view
of
the
mere
evidence
rule
and
its
contemporary
viability.
it
is
no
great
art
to
cite
numerous
authorities
from
this
court
and
other
scholarly
sources
as
to
the
contemporary
lack
of
reason
or
rationale
for
the
exclusion
of
evidence
because
it
is
of
an
evidential
value
only.
the
concept
of
evidential
value
only
or
mere
evidence,
it
strikes
me,
has
little
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment,
i
should
think
authorizes,
authorizes
permits
the
acquisition
of
evidence
which
is
of
an
incriminatory
nature
for
the
purpose
of
use
as
evidence.
we're
not
now
talking
about
a
trespass.
we're
not
now
talking
about
the
trespass
upon
a
man's
right
to
hold
his
plot
of
ground
secure
against
the
footsteps
of
the
king's
officers.
we're
talking
about
a
right
which
is
much
more
intangible
and
much
more
precious
if
you
will
right
than
not
which
is
the
right
to
privacy
itself.
now,
the
right
to
privacy
is
as
much
invaded
by
a
search
for
contraband
as
it
is
by
a
search
for
mere
evidence.
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
discussing
the
gouled
case
and
the
mere
evidence
rule,
i
should
make
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
have
quarrel
with
the
--
a
proposition
for
which
gouled
has
been
repeatedly
cited
by
this
court
even
during
this
term.
and
that
is,
that
an
entry
by
deception
is
for
the
--
it's
for
the
fourth
amendment
purposes
equivalent
to
an
entry
by
force.
when
we
speak
--
mr.
richard
uviller
equivalent
to
an
entry
by
force.
when
we
speak
of
overruling
gouled,
naturally
i'm
speaking
only
about
aspect
of
gouled
which
says
that,
you
cannot
obtain
a
warrant
for
matters
of
evidentiary
value
only.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
it
would
be
overruling
quite
a
lot
mr.
justice
but
it
would
also
be
consistent
with
quite
a
lot.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
its
own
decisions
had
very
frequently
ignored
the
so-called
mere
evidence
aspect
of
the
gouled
rule
either
by
not
citing
gouled
at
all
or
in
many
instances
by
what
i
think
is
a
distortion
of
the
meaning
of
gouled
and
that
is
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir
and
that
is
by
the
construction
of
instrumentality
to
be
so
broad
that
in
fact
it
includes
what
i
would
consider
more
realistically
speaking
mere
evidence.
indeed
i
could
argue
here
for
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
mere
evidence
rule
of
gouled
by
simply
noting
that
the
conversations
in
this
case
were
in
furtherance
of
a
criminal
conspiracy,
a
conspiracy
and
agreement
implies
conversations
between
the
conspirators
and
the
words
used
here
from
furtherance.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
and
as
i
say
mr.
justice,
this
argument
has
been
accepted
in
some
cases
and
rejected
in
others.
in
many
instances
like
osborn
and
hoffa
and
so
forth
words
or
i
could
say
for
example,
that
the
mere
evidence
rule
does
not
apply
to
evidence
seized
from
the
person
for
some
reason
and
i
could
say
that
words
are
necessarily
evidence
seized
from
the
person
and
therefore
exempt
from
the
gouled
proscription.
mr.
richard
uviller
my
understanding
of
it
mr.
justice
is
that
no
warrant
will
issue
and
no
seizure
maybe
had
or
search
may
maybe
conducted
for
matters
or
materials
which
are
of
evidentiary
value
only
and
do
not
fall
into
the
categories
of
the
fruits
of
a
crime,
instrumentalities
of
the
crime,
or
contraband,
including
weapons.
mr.
richard
uviller
in
my
understanding
of
it
mr.
justice,
it
goes
back
further
than
that.
the
medieval
doctrine
of
deo
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
have
thought
that
the
star
chamber
proceedings
used
general
warrants
and
that
these
general
warrants
issued
for
the
seizure
of
contraband
in
the
nature
of
seditious
writings
and
that
indeed
the
mere
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir,
but
the
the
rule
exempting
mere
evidence
from
seizure,
i
would
say
was
not
applicable
to
the
warrants
issued
by
the
star
chamber.
i
should
say
that
the
rule
exempting
--
mr.
richard
uviller
as
i
--
as
i
recall
what
lord
camden
said
in
entick
was
that
the
search
for
private
papers
is
more
heinous
than
the
warrants
issued
by
the
star
chamber
rather
than
stating
that
they
would
be
equivalence.
and
i
think
that
he
based
that
on
the
fact
that
a
search
for
private
papers
that
was
mere
evidence,
but
on
the
fact
that
the
right
to
possession
of
private
papers
was
in
the
person
from
whom
they
were
taken
and
that
this
right
to
possession
made
the
seizure
a
serious
trespass.
i
suggest
that
the
--
the
foundation
of
the
mere
evidence
rule
is
totally
inappropriate
to
rule
of
evidence.
that
it
--
that
it
relates
purely
to
a
question
of,
who
has
the
right
to
possess?
contraband;
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
possess
therefore
it
maybe
seized.
the
instrumentalities
of
a
crime
by
medieval
and
perhaps
even
present
day
thought
become
themselves
somewhat
infected
and
have
to
be
purified
by
the
church
or
state
and
therefore
can
be
seized.
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
yes
and
indeed
in
that
era,
it
appears
that
there
was
--
there
were
safeguards.
the
person
who
owned
the
property
had
to
go
along
with
the
marshal
and
identify
it
as
his
before
it
could
be
seized.
but
i
suggest
that
this
is
all
consistent
with
a
notion
of
property,
who
in
whom
was
the
property
interest?
and
only
--
and
you
could
deprive
a
suspect
of
property
only
if
you
could
show
that
he
did
not
have
a
property
interest
in
it.
i
suggest
today
and
--
and
under
the
fourth
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
i'm
reinterpreting
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that's
the
--
that
it
--
that
it
has
been
reinterpreted
and
i'm
trying
to
restore
to
its
original
interpretation.
our
--
our
--
many
of
our
constitutional
rights
were
founded
on
18th
century
notions
of
private
property
and
have
been
reinterpreted
to
a
more
intangible
and
more
contemporary
notion
of
a
right
to
privacy
that
exists
without
regard
to
whether
one
has
property
seized
or
invaded
in
the
course
of
the
breach
of
the
privacy.
mr.
richard
uviller
may
i
respond
to
that
mr.
justice
by
saying
that
in
our
brief
we
advocate
an
abandonment
of
the
silverman-goldman
distinction.
consistent
with
our
position
that
there
is
a
right
to
privacy
that
it
exists
without
regard
to
the
boundaries
of
physical
property,
we
suggest
that
there
should
be
fourth
amendment
regulation
of
any
search
whether
it
be
by
physical
trespass
or
by
electronic
intrusion.
and
so,
these
magnificent
devices
which
your
honor
referred
to,
which
can
pierce
walls
without
physical
trespass,
should
by
all
rights
come
within
the
regulation
of
the
fourth
amendment
both
as
to
proscription
and
as
to
permissiveness.
and
the
same
standards
which
authorized
the
physical
intrusion
in
the
search
for
evidence
of
a
--
of
a
tangible
nature
should
control
the
search
for
evidence
of
an
oral
nature
whether
or
not
made
by
physical
intrusion.
i
think
that
perhaps
what
we're
tending
toward
here
is
an
underlying
feeling
that
all
who
considered
this
problem
are
confessed
to
and
that
is
that
there
is
somewhere
in
all
of
us
a
deeply
rooted
and
essential
repugnance
for
the
notion
of
the
silent
--
all
of
the
invisible
ear
of
the
state
present
during
what
is
considered
by
most
of
us
to
be
an
extremely
private
and
personal
event,
and
that
is
speech
within
protected
quarters.
certainly,
i
and
we
are
not
immune
from
that
sensation
of
repugnance
and
revulsion
of
for
these
intrusions,
but
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
by
analysis,
all
attempts,
all
efforts
by
law
enforcement
to
enforce
its
laws
inevitably
involved
some
intrusion.
indeed
in
many
instances
of
conventional
searches
not
heretofore
challenged,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
intrusion
is
at
least
as
great
as
that
by
electronic
eavesdrop.
indeed,
it
is
too
final
line
to
draw.
in
irvin
for
example,
there
was
no
order.
the
dirty
business
which
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
in
the
slogan
with
which
we
have
to
contend
in
these
matters
was
not
addressed
to
electronic
surveillance
per
se,
but
it
was
addressed
to
electronic
surveillance
without
prior
mandate
by
court.
in
the
case
of
the
search
for
evidence
and
i
don't
care
now
whether
it
is
by
questioning
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
mr.
justice
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
cognizant
of
that
of
view
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
see
it
that
way
myself
and
i
do
not
--
and
i
argue
for
a
contrary
position.
mr.
richard
uviller
perhaps
so
and
if
so,
if
justice
bradley
in
boyd
meant
to
exempt
private
papers
or
certain
types
of
evidence
like
that
from
the
permissive
aspect
of
the
fourth
amendment,
then
i
suggest
that
he
does
so
without
foundation
in
constitutional
history.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
say
anything
about
the
type
of
evidence
to
be
seized.
it
talks
only
about
the
manner
in
which
a
search
can
be
executed.
and
the
clear
implication
to
me
of
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
if
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
amendment
itself
are
adhered
to,
that
a
warrant
may
issue
for
the
search
and
seizure
of
virtually
anything.
mr.
richard
uviller
there
has
certainly
been
controversy
in
that.
mr.
richard
uviller
that
of
course
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that
is
--
that
is
the
hardest,
the
hardest
and
most
extreme
limit.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
yes
--
well,
i
would
almost
go
so
far
as
to
say,
yes,
if
it
had
been
written
originally
without
compulsion.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
would
have
no
doubt
for
instance
that
letters
confessing
the
crime
could
be
reached
by
a
search
warrant.
i
would
have
no
--
this
is
--
this
is
evidence.
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
suppose
you
would
keep
a
copy,
i
--
i
would
think
--
i
think
it
could
be
obtained
against
you.
i
think
its
evidence.
i
think
that
what
we're
dealing
here
is
--
mr.
richard
uviller
no.
i
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
relates
to
every
--
every
instance
in
which
there
was
some
form
of
compulsion
--
mr.
richard
uviller
--
exerted
upon
the
man
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
subpoena
--
the
subpoena
i
say
is
a
special
case.
mr.
richard
uviller
i'm
talking
now
about
--
mr.
richard
uviller
it
was
compelled
at
the
time
it
was
made?
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
then
this
fifth
amendment
question,
a
fifth
amendment
barred.
it
would
have
to
be
freely
made;
free
of
compulsion
at
the
time
it
was
made
and
then
if
it
constitutes
evidence
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
yes,
i
do
think
that
a
subpoena
would
be
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
it's
that
easy.
first
place,
you
would
have
to
show
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
think
there
would
be
no
compulsion
within
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
uviller
no.
at
the
time
of
the
affirmative
act
of
bringing
it
forward
and
identifying
it,
pursuant
to
the
court
order.
mr.
richard
uviller
oh,
yes
--
oh,
you
would
have
to
identify
it.
mr.
richard
uviller
right,
if
he
responds.
mr.
richard
uviller
here
it
is
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
so,
these
are
the
papers
in
my
desk.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
believe
so.
i
believe
he
is
there
for
--
he
is
--
he
is
ordered
to
do
something
which
--
which
links
him
with
the
document
and
therefore
provides
a
link
in
the
--
in
the
incriminating
chain.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
do
think
so
justice
white
and
i
think
so
on
this
basis.
i
think
that
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
do
anything
when
a
search
warrant
is
issued.
indeed,
he
may
not
even
be
present.
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
i
do
either.
i'm
--
i'm
discussing
now
obviously
a
search
and
seizure
for
tangible
evidence
because
i
mean
to
bring
a
search
and
seizure
for
oral
evidence
into
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment
by
analogy.
i
think
for
example
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
without
in
anyway
abandoning
that
position
based
on
the
reasonableness
clause
which
i
would
adhere
to,
what
i'm
arguing
here
is
that
the
order
of
the
court
must
conform
to
the
spirit
of
the
warrant
clause.
and
that
--
that
if
we
are
--
since
we
are
not
allowing,
let
us
say,
eavesdrops
incident
to
an
arrest
or
eavesdrops
necessitated
by
some
sort
of
abstract
of
reasonableness.
but
in
new
york,
we
have
the
statutory
scheme
which
presupposes
a
court
order
and
that
court
order
based
upon
probable
cause,
i
suggest
that
that
statutory
scheme
was
drawn
with
the
warrant
clause
in
mind.
and
that
it
is
--
it
is
the
obedience
to
the
warrant
clause
which
would
justify
the
--
the
813
(c)
scheme.
now,
the
--
the
particular
--
mr.
richard
uviller
about
the
gouled
--
mr.
richard
uviller
well
as
i
said,
i
could
argue
around
gouled.
i
could
say
these
are
instrumentalities.
and
gouled
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that's
the
way
i
felt.
and
they
--
and
i
could
also
argue
that
this
is
from
the
person,
gouled
is
not
applied
to
evidence
from
the
person.
but
i
think
that
the
harder
and
perhaps
the
more
honest
approach
is
to
see
gouled
as
an
obstacle
to
this
position.
i'm
--
i
was
--
i
was
talking
about
the
dissent
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
read
gouled
as
a
--
as
based
on
boyd.
i
think
they
simply
said
in
gouled
that
a
warrant
cannot
issue
for
matters
that
are
of
evidentiary
value
only.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
--
one
would
have
to
read
between
the
lines
i
think
to
see
it.
i
--
i
would
say
that
certainly
the
idea
of
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
justice
black
that
it
was
of
surreptitious
nature
of
the
seizure
in
the
gouled.
there
--
it
was
a
surreptitious
seizure
but
as
i
read
gouled,
it
wasn't
somewhat
surreptitious
character
of
it
as
the
deception
practice
to
gain
entry
and
access.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
--
mr.
richard
uviller
that
aspect
of
gouled,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
at
all,
justice
black,
at
all
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
very
clear
--
mr.
richard
uviller
not
--
no,
i
thought
--
i
thought
i
started
this
afternoon
by
saying
that.
when
i
say
overrule
it,
i
do
not
mean
overrule
that
aspect
of
it
that
was
cited
so
frequently
by
this
court
and
which
we
have
no
quarrel
with.
we're
only
talking
about
that
aspect
which
deals
with
the
mere
–
so
called
mere
evidence
rule.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir,
i
am
sir.
the
surreptitious,
let's
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
surreptitious
nature
of
this
type
of
evidence
gathering.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
this
is
surreptitious.
indeed
it
depends
for
its
effectiveness
on
being
surreptitious.
it
could
hardly
be
argued
that
eavesdropping
should
be
permitted
only
if
a
presentation
of
the
order
is
made
to
the
suspect
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bug
is
installed.
it
could
hardly
be
argued
indeed
that
a
public
record
should
be
made
of
the
order
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bug
is
installed.
it
is
by
its
nature
secret.
is
that
secrecy
itself
essentially
repugnant?
it
does
not
offend
fourteenth
amendment
principles
of
due
process.
i
suggest
once
again
that
it
is
nothing
but
another
variety
of
a
very
common
more
enforcement
investigative
technique
and
that
is
surreptitiousness.
let
us
take
for
example
the
simplest
form
which
i
doubt
anyone
could
argue
was
contrary
to
constitutional
principles.
and
that
is
following
a
man,
surveillance
by
keeping
him
in
sight,
and
going
with
him
wherever
he
goes
secretly,
recording
his
movements.
is
that
an
invasion
of
privacy?
it
is,
but
indeed,
there's
not
even
a
requirement
for
a
warrant
for
that.
perhaps,
they
should
be,
but
i
would
suggest
that
with
or
without
a
warrant,
it
has
never
been
challenged
as
a
secret
surveillance
and
an
invasion
of
privacy
because
of
its
secrecy.
this
is
true
indeed
of
many
law
enforcement
techniques,
some
of
which
was
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
this
term
such
as
for
example,
the
purchase
of
narcotics
by
a
person
who
is
masquerading
as
a
narcotics
user.
he
is
a
police
officer.
he
is
secretly
gathering
evidence
by
the
purchase
of
these
narcotics
to
use
against
the
man.
is
the
fact
of
secrecy,
the
fact
of
deception
there
in
and
of
itself
so
essentially
repugnant
to
our
notions
of
liberty
and
privacy
as
to
invalidate
it,
i
think
not.
so
here
too,
i
think
that
the
element
of
secrecy
the
fact
that
the
entry
to
install
a
bug
was
surreptitious
indeed
would
have
been
the
crime
of
burglary,
had
it
not
been
for
the
order.
i
do
not
think
that
in
of
itself
should
warrant
exclusion
of
this
very
valuable
and
important
means
of
obtaining
evidence
otherwise
inaccessible.
mr.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice
i
agree
that
it
should
be
solved.
i
see
no
reason
why
there
should
not
be
a
record
made,
a
public
record
made.
i
see
no
reason
why
the
prevalence
should
not
be
subject
to
legislative
or
executive
inquiry.
indeed
it
would
help
a
great
deal
if
we
knew
just
how
often
these
devices
were
used
and
in
what
sort
of
case,
and
in
what
--
with
what
results.
i
think
there
should
be
such
a
record
made
and
i
think
that
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it
then
some
policy
does.
however
in
new
york,
that
is
in
effect
done
because
the
order
is
a
written
document.
it
is
based
upon
an
affidavit
sworn
to
in
writing.
these
two
documents
are
placed
in
the
records
of
the
court
and
in
the
records
of
the
public
agency
by
which
they
were
acquired.
they
are
subject
to
challenge
and
to
inspection
on
subsequent
occasions
after
the
termination
of
the
investigation
in
question.
indeed,
that
is
how
it
comes
before
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
it
is
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes
sir,
yes,
sir.
in
effect,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
filed
in
that
--
well,
in
effect
in
this
--
in
this
sense,
if
any
evidence
was
obtained
from
this
which
is
going
to
be
use
on
it
or
use
as
leads
to
other
evidence.
then
the
defendant
has
a
motion
to
suppress
that
evidence
during
which
he
challenges
the
underlying
order,
gets
to
see
it
and
read
it
exactly
as
he
would
a
search
warrant.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
have
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
sir.
but
it's
part
of
the
motion
to
suppress
which
lies
to
challenge
--
mr.
richard
uviller
there's
no
statutory
requirement
for
notice
as
to
this.
what
happens
in
--
in
point
of
fact
is
that
an
inquiry
is
made
usually
informal
between
the
parties
and
the
district
attorney
answers
it.
and
the
defendant
then
brings
his
motion
which
is
heard
before
trial
during
which
there
is
full
disclosure.
mr.
richard
uviller
i
can't
really
answer
for
the
other
counties
of
our
state
justice
brennan
except
to
say
that
the
motion
to
suppress
lies
by
state
law
in
all
counties
--
mr.
richard
uviller
--
and
there
must
be
some
sort
of
system
worked
out
county
by
county
by
which
the
defendant
is
given
an
opportunity
to
make
this
motion.
now
it
maybe
for
example
that,
he
might
not
find
out
about
it
until
cross-examination,
but
usually
during
the
trial
if
not
before
the
trial,
he's
going
to
discover
if
he
hasn't
already
been
told
that
such
a
device
has
been
used.
now,
is
it
filed
in
every
case?
it
was
not
filed
in
the
sense
that
there's
any
room
other
than
the
record
room
of
the
district
attorney's
office
in
which
all
of
these
orders
are
placed,
but
as
far
in
the
sense
that
it
becomes
part
of
the
court
record.
now,
the
problems
and
situations
which
i
should
also
mention
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir
mr.
richard
uviller
in
the
circumstances
where
the
case
goes
to
trial.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
richard
uviller
where
there
is
either
evidence
directly
from
the
tape
or
obtained
through
the
use
of
the
tape
that
will
be
introduced
against
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
and
that
too,
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
we
have
the
same
poison
fruit
doctrine
there
if
the
order
--
if
the
tape
order
was
not
properly
founded,
that
is
the
eavesdropping
order,
then
any
results,
leads,
information,
witnesses
obtained
through
the
--
through
what
was
overheard
is
subject
to
suppression
as
a
fruit
of
the
poison
tree.
mr.
richard
uviller
by
decision,
sir.
mr.
richard
uviller
as
to-
as
to
what
was
actually
heard?
mr.
richard
uviller
well,
i
should
say
that
that
--
that
varies,
i
--
i
obviously
would
have
to
because
the
information
is
different
in
every
case.
the
difficulty
is
that
he
may
not
obtain
the
information
that
is
not
to
be
use
against
him,
but
i
should
say
that
that
again
is
similar
to
a
conventional
search
situation
where
everything
that
is
perceived
during
the
course
of
the
search
is
not
subject
to
suppression,
but
only
that
which
is
obtained
for
introduction
in
evidence
and
the
same
thing
pertains
to
evidence
obtained
by
oral
order.
the
--
mr.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
i
believe
there
is.
and
i
--
we
have
this
--
the
amicus
is
set
forth
if
your
honor
has
if
the
amicus
attorney
general
of
new
york
has
set
forth
all
the
statutes
in
new
york
dealing
with
this
particular
area.
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
particular
order
and
the
question
of
probable
cause
if
i
may.
here
the
sequence
of
events
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
indicates
that
–
although
there
were
two
eavesdrop
orders
in
question
here;
one
on
an
attorney
named
neyer
and
the
other
on
steinman,
the
results
of
only
the
steinman
evidence
was
used
against
this
defendant.
the
first
one,
neyer,
provided
the
lead
and
indeed
was
referred
to
in
the
affidavit
seeking
the
steinman
order.
however,
as
to
the
neyer
order
and
it
was
not
on
berger's
premises,
berger
the
petitioner
here,
never
spoke
into
that
microphone
or
in
its
vicinity
and
therefore
we
suggest
that
as
to
the
first
order,
this
neyer
order,
berger
is
without
standing
under
the
jones
against
the
united
states
to
contest
the
legality
of
the
order.
true,
that
insofar
as
the
background
of
that
order
became
the
background
for
the
steinman
order,
he
may
contest
that,
but
as
to
the
face
of
the
affidavit
and
whether
it
spelled
that
probable
cause
efficiently
on
the
face
of
the
neyer
affidavit,
i
suggest
that
by
all
conventional
rules,
he
has
no
standing
to
raise
it.
as
to
the
steinman
order
where
he
does
have
--
mr.
richard
uviller
because
there
was
no
--
he's
not
a
party
aggrieved
by
that
search.
he
was
not
one
whose
cartilage
was
invaded,
it
wasn't
his
office,
though,
was
he
there
during
the
--
the
existence
of
the
tap?
nor
was
his
voice
recorded
by
the
eavesdrop.
therefore,
there
was
no
invasion
of
his
right
to
privacy
by
the
tap
on
neyer
--
by
the
bug
in
neyer's
office.
i
suggest
under
jones
that
not
only
must
he
be
the
defendant,
but
he
must
also
be
the
party
whose
constitutional
rights
were
invaded
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
bonafides
of
the
order
under
which
it
was
installed.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
doesn't
have
a
basis
for
challenging
the
neyer
eavesdrop
insofar
as
it
was
used
to
obtain
the
steinman
eavesdrop
and
indeed
it
was.
the
affidavit
for
the
steinman
drop
referred
to
the
fact
that
matters
have
been
learned
over
the
neyer
eavesdrop,
but
the
only
question
really
on
appraising
the
adequacy
of
an
order
from
a
probable
cause
standpoint,
is
what
did
the
judge
who
signed
the
order,
the
warrant
if
you
will
know
at
the
time
he
signed
it,
and
was
that
which
was
revealed
to
him
sufficient
to
constitute
probable
cause.
mr.
richard
uviller
the
steinman
affidavit.
mr.
richard
uviller
no,
there
is
more
than
that.
the
judge
--
unfortunately
the
record
is
not
too
clear
on
this,
but
the
judge
indicated
that
he
had
been
told
various
other
things
by
the
district
attorney
who
presented
that
affidavit
to
him.
and
there
is
some
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
he
was
told
but
unfortunately
neither
the
judge's
minutes
nor
any
papers
were
introduced
to
that
effect,
though,
there
is
evidence
to
amplify
the
steinman
affidavit.
i
suggest
that
in
this
instance
there
is
sufficient
there
to
constitute
probable
cause
and
indeed
--
mr.
richard
uviller
the
steinman
order
mr.
richard
uviller
just
the
affidavit.
mr.
richard
uviller
just
the
affidavit.
now
the
order
itself
that
was
issued
on
steinman
which
is
also
here
for
review,
incorporates
that
affidavit
by
reference
and
i
suggest
that
the
two
have
to
be
read
together.
while
the
order
itself
says,
may
over
hear
and
in
all
conversations
occurring
at
this
place
during
this
period,
it
also
adopts
the
affidavit
itself.
and
reading
with
two
together,
the
order
specifies
the
thing
to
be
seized
and
it
specifies
it
by
referring
to
the
crime
to
which
it
relates.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
is
adequate
specification
in
particularity
in
the
conventional
search
and
seizure
doctrine.
if
you
identify
gambling,
paraphernalia
for
example,
just
simply
by
the
crime
to
which
it
relates
that
is
particularity
for
a
search
warrant
purposes.
and
here,
the
particularity
in
this
order
was
conversations
relating
to
the
transmission
of
bribe
money
to
the
state
liquor
authority
in
a
conspiracy
to
obtain
liquor
licenses
unlawfully
and
to
that
degree
of
specificity
i
suggest
satisfies
conventional
search
and
seizure
requirements.
