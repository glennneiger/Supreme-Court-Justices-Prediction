it
was

in
the
conventional
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
do
you
say
it
wasn't
a
wire
tap
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
wasn't
--
it
was
restricted
to
what
went
over
the
telephone
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
the
telephone?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
where's
the
warrant?

continued

justice
william
o.
douglas
the
conversation
that
they
take
place
in
room
1001
at
22
west
42nd
–
48th.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
an
attorney's
office?
justice
william
o.
douglas
whose
--
whose
office
was
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
this
war
--
warrant
limited
to
a
day
or
an
hour
or
any
particular
time?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
60
days
is
provided
by
statute?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
this
said
--
this
didn't
use
airways
just
before
the
transmittal
to
the
receiving
machine?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
you
know
the
federal
communications
commission
recently
issued
an
order
governing
certain
transmission
by
devices
like
this.
would
this
have
satisfied
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
under
the
bed?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
one
be
the
if
that's
been
accepted
warrant
issue,
could
it
issue
under
the
new
york
act
or
is
this
relate
just
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
you
had
any
experience
with
that
in
new
york?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
the
miranda
case,
he
was
talking
in
the
cell
in
the
precinct
--
in
his
precinct,
he
wasn't
really
tortured.
he
was
talking
voluntarily
in
that
sense,
but
he
was
in
an
atmosphere,
we
said
of
coercion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
the
seizure
of
a
letter
by
a
subpoena
or
the
seizure
of
a
letter
by
a
warrant
doesn't
have
in
it
the
element
of
voluntariness
that
we
normally
associate
it
with?
justice
william
o.
douglas
go
ahead
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
as
i
read
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
these
cases
from
the
18th
century
--
in
the
18th
century,
they
were
--
they
were
tested
by
usage
of
a
trespass
action.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
was
john
wilkes,
wasn't
it?
there
was
entick
and
carrington
and
so
on?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
this
would
be
a
trespass
but
for
this
warrant?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
would
be
overruled
in
federal
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
those
in
your
brief?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
--
i
just
happen
to
read
yesterday
this
entick
reread,
entick
versus
carrington,
that
was
the
argument
that
they
made
there?
the
words
were
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
the
letters
obtained.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
was
back
to
the
practice
from
the
star
chamber
of
getting
and
collecting
letters?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
yes.
but
i
mean
in
terms
of
the
immediate
background
of
entick
and
carrington
were
the
vows
of
colonel
sydney
and
the
rest
of
them
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
were
sent
to
their
death
on
the
letters
that
were
found?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
they
define
it
as
broadly
as
you
do?
i
mean,
something
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
of
the
crime?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
in
the
camden
and
as
i've
read
entick
and
carrington
puts
the
two
together.
he
condemns
a
general
warrant
and
he
condemns
the
use
of
testimonial
evidence?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
even
a
cook
would
disagree
with
you
on
that?
and
there
was
--
as
you
know
of
a
great
tempest
about
the
search
for
stolen
property.
justice
william
o.
douglas
contraband?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
with
great
confidence
because
that
assumes
that
a
warrant
can
issue
for
the
search
of
anything?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
there's
a
school
of
thought
that
thinks
that
there
are
two
parts
of
the
fourth
amendment;
one
that
has
its
own
privacy
that
can't
be
penetrated
even
by
the
judge
and
that
the
other
can
be
by
a
warrant?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
what
bradley
must
have
meant
in
boyd?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
you
would
--
your
--
your
first
opponent
on
that
would
be
collie
and
i
think
his
first
edition
of
constitutional
limitations
for
quite
the
opposite
view,
later
followed
by
bradley.
well
anyway,
there's
a
--
that
of
quite
of
an
argument
about
the
seizure
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
about
the
evidence
obtained
through
leads?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
was
not
a
wire
tap
in
the
conventional
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
do
you
say
it
wasn't
a
wire
tap
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
wasn't
--
it
was
restricted
to
what
went
over
the

then?
justice

on
the

justice
william
o.

so,
where's
