justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
was
not
the
electronic
eavesdropping,
would
you
say
that
there
have
to
be
applications
to
the
judge
and
order
under
the
constitution
for
plain
ordinary
everyday
eavesdropping
could
be
engaged
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
would
one
be
required,
suppose
that
they
were
not
in
a
house,
they
won't
use
without
somebody
on
the
outside
of
the
house,
in
the
street?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
wouldn't,
but
would
you
--
would
you
think
that
that
somehow
violates
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all.
i
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
just
related
then
to
electronic
eavesdropping
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
before
getting
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
call
that
constitutionally
intolerable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
challenge
to
boyd
or
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that,
you
do
not
think
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
a
search
or
seizure,
but
only
a
search
and
seizure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
exclusionary
rule.
i'm
talking
about
the
protection
of
the
amendment.
i
had
supposed
that
included
both
an
unlawful
search
and
in
unlawful
seizure
separately
or
collectively?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
be
crucial,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
equivalent
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
object
to
telling
me
your
idea
of
what
was
meant
by
the
mere
evidence
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
–
at
the
time
this
was
made.
i
thought
he
had
it
in
his
possessions
and
the
government
issued
a
subpoena
and
says,
“bring
to
me
at
once,
his
confession
he
made,”
would
that
not
be
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
gouled
is
deciding
and
what
it
did
on
the
basis
of
the
reasonableness
or
the
totality
of
circumstances
involved
in
the
search
and
seizure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
said
that
but
do
you
think
if
they
ignored
the
fact
that
constitutes
–
the
fourth
amendment
says,
reasonable
search
and
seizures
did
not
consider
all
of
the
circumstances
such
as
sleeping
in
the
office
at
night
or
at
daytime,
and
surreptitiously
taking
his
favorites
[attempt
to
laughter]
away.
do
you
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
that
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
did
read
that
that's
a
part
of
the
circumstances
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
when
you
determine
whether
it's
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
also
depend
on
all
the
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
circumstance
to
determine
on
the
whole
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
search?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
wouldn't
want
to
overrule
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
objecting
to
it
your
statement
which
from
your
standpoint
as
i
gather
it
attempts
seems
to
make
it
“per
se
rule”
out
of
a
situation
where
under
the
general
rule,
you
decide
under
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
if
whether
it's
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
justice
