justice
abe
fortas
what
happened
to
the
tape?
was
the
entire
tape
of
all
recordings
produced
in
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
doesn't
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
cut
across
your
argument
with
respect
to
this
minifon?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
if
you
say
its
like
a
search
warrant,
it
is?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
your
reliance
is
on
schmerber?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
certainly
is
not
the
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
been
--
that's
been
an
accuracy
of
testimonial
privilege
of
saying
its
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
how
are
you
helped
if
you
--
you
are
--
if
there
is
a
wall
erected
between
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment,
but
nevertheless
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
violation
here?
i
take
it
that
the
stipulation
here
means
that
the
words
which
were
garnered
and
some
other
might
take
it
from
mr.
berger's
own
lips.
justice
abe
fortas
the
words
that
were
garnered
by
this
surreptitious
trespass
were
incriminatory.
i
take
it
that
that's
what
we
have
to
assume
from
the
stipulation?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
raises
the
fifth
amendment
problem,
how
are
you
helped?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
at
least
knew
that
he
was
talking
to
the
police
agents,
but
here
you
have
a
man
talking
without
knowing
that
he's
talking
to
police
agents
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
would
be
putting
hard
i
should
think
to
say
that
this
was
a
voluntary
like
on
the
part
of
mr.
berger,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
quite
a
different
kind
of
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happens
to
him
if
he
refuses
to
submit
to
the
search
and
it's
--
but
it's
a
lawful
warrant?
what
happens
to
him?
do
the
police
say,
“well,
that's
okay?
thank
you
very
much.
goodbye.”
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
would
say
that's
not
coercive
that
that
doesn't
involve
any
element
of
coercion?
justice
abe
fortas
it
just
says
that
you
have
a
choice
between
making
yourself
incriminatory
statements
or
going
to
jail,
that's
all?
justice
abe
fortas
the
problem
is
--
the
problem
is
to
whether
--
the
problem
is
whether
the
compelled
action,
the
two
--
two
questions.
one
is
the
action
compelled
in
a
sense;
and
two
is,
whether
the
action
is
in
violation
of
constitutional
right.
and
there
you
have
when
you're
talking
about
the
--
whether
this
is
a
voluntary
action
or
whether
it
has
an
element
of
involuntariness
and
i
was
suggesting
as
a
remote
hypothesis
that
where
a
man
is
required
to
do
something
on
pain
of
going
to
jail
that
that
may
not
be
totally
voluntary.
next
question
is
whether
--
what
he
is
being
compelled
to
do
is
something
if
the
state
can
properly
compel
the
citizen
to
do
or
whether
it
is
in
violation
of
the
citizen's
constitutional
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
you've
quite
misunderstand
me,
of
course
you
do.
i'm
talking
about
conversation.
i'm
talking
about
something
that
a
person
says,
so
well
within
the
scope
to
which
the
amendment
applies.
i'm
talking
about
conversations,
statement
of
the
person
that
is
obtained
from
him
either
by
the
an
application
of
force
as
in
the
old
days
or
by
a
surreptitious
trespass
as
it
seems
to
me
a
current
practice
in
some
areas
right
now.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
had
the
court
order?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
that
really
the
difference
between
the
osborn
situation
and
this,
that
is
to
say
in
osborn,
there's
the
chance
anyway
that
the
conversation
would
be
--
that
was
reported
would
be
pinpointed
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
be
pinpointed
and
related
to
the
subject
as
to
which
there
was
presumably
a
showing
of
probable
cause
and
that's
the
difference
between
minifon
in
the
osborn
situation
and
this
sort
of
a
universal
recording
of
whatever
goes
on
and
including
i
assume
many
things
that
had
no
relationship
or
whatever
to
the
showing
of
probable
cause?
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
startling
to
me
with
all
respect
to
have
a
suggestion
that
entire
history
of
search
and
seizure,
the
english
history,
our
own
history
which
were
also
crown
as
to
be
reread
and
reinterpreted
in
terms
of
property
instead
of
human
liberty
and
i'm
afraid
that
what
you're
saying
sounds
that
way
to
me?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
--
if
you
limited
that
to
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure,
and
if
you
limited
it
to
verbal
statements,
perhaps
history
would
not
in
the
future
because
in
those
days
they
did
not
have
the
blessing
under
these
magnificent
devices
by
which
people's
words
could
be
picked
up
and
recorded
surreptitiously?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that
he
doesn't
identify
it.
