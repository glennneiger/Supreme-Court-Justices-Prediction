justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
it
didn't
even
hear
both
into
the
telephone
conversation,
it
just
--
it
just
heard
what
was
said
in
the
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
have
the
same
reaction,
if
mr.
steinman
after
say
the
first
--
first
event
or
first
business
arrangement
with
the
police
and
then
begin
working
with
the
police
and
--
but
no
one
knew
it.
and
he
--
and
he
sat
in
his
own
office
or
in
mr.
neyer's
office
and
had
conversations
with
many
people
and
reported
them
to
the
police.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
that
be
--
you
would
--
with
or
without
a
warrant,
i
supposed
you
would
say
that
word
unconstitutional
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
went
to
mr.
neyer's
office,
would
that
be
a
trespass?
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
made
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
trespasser
or
not,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
want
to
know
that
you
would
find
it's
constitutionally
intolerable
whether
steinman
had
conversations
in
his
own
office
or
in
neyer's
office,
as
long
as
he
was
working
with
the
police
and
the
others
didn't
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
be
true
whether
he
carries
a
“minifon”
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
have
the
same
reaction,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
quite
willing
to
assume
that
the
police
--
that
the
police
did
something
here
which
without
the
order
would
be
trespass?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
i
mean,
that's
what
you
--
so
we
can
assume
that
there
was
a
--
this
criminal
trespass
absent
the
orders
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
really
--
you
can
go
ahead
but
that
--
what
--
is
there
really
anything
seized
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
--
what
if
the
police
--
what
if
the
warrant
authorized
the
policeman
to
hide
in
the
closet?
they
had
no
recording
device
or
anything
else,
they
just
listened
and
came
out
to
testified
to
what
he
heard,
is
there
a
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
--
does
it
make
any
difference
though?
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
there
wasn't
any
seizure,
you
still
got
the
same
problem,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
there's
no
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
–
that's
what
i
say
you
still
have
the
same
thing
left
even
if
you
say
there
isn't
anything
--
there
isn't
any
seizure.
the
fact
that
there's
evidence
offered
and
testimony
offered,
it
doesn't
mean
there
was
a
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
seizure
to
file
in
the
--
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
and
there
could
be
a
search
that
but
no
seizure
or
whatsoever
that
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
don't
--
this
doesn't
appear
to
me
that
it
makes
much
difference
when
you
call
a
seizure,
not
as
you
saw
this
thing
problem
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
is
not
about
seizure
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
couple
of
the
--
three
or
four
weeks
ago,
an
argument
here
on
the
building
inspection,
the
opposite
of
frank
against
maryland,
the
question
is
inspection,
not
the
seizure,
no
issues
there
not
--
whether
or
not
as
the
fourth
amendment,
it
does
protects
people
from
being
inspected.
it's
not
seized
and
i
suppose
that
a
policeman
that
just
walks
through
a
door
without
a
warrant
with
no
probable
cause
or
anything
else
or
didn't
report
that
walked
through
the
house,
seized
nothing
saw
nothing
there
was
no
criminal
case
pending
or
anything
might
well
be
--
might
well
be
sued
or
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
successfully
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
were
sued
under
the
civil
rights
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
for
violation
of
constitutional
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
think
that
a
search
warrant
would
then
be
--
it
will
be
substituted
with
it.
well,
i
can't
get
it
by
subpoena
because
of
compulsion,
i
will
just
get
a
search
warrant
and
go
get
it.
i
know
it's
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
if
only
you
would
have
to
be
--
you
would
have
to
be
there
was
no
compulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
only
you'd
say
there
would
say
there
would
be
a
compulsion
not
at
the
time
of
the
confession,
but
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
what
if
the
subpoena
--
all
the
subpoena
says,
“bring
all
the
papers
in
your
desk,”
and
he
brings
all
the
papers
in
the
desk.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
that
is
the
compulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
it's
different
if
somebody
against
his
will
walks
through
the
door
and
picks
the
papers
with
this
warrant
and
picks
the
papers
out
of
the
--
out
of
his
desk
in
his
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
you
have
to
take
this
position
that
to
be
consistent
with
all
--
every
other
part
of
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
still
room
in
fourth
amendment
though
you
forgot
about
this.
if
you
say
the
overall
--
the
overall
test
is
reasonableness
in
terms
of
what
you
can
search
and
seize,
to
search
for
and
seize,
it
very
easily
that
be
said
at
the
constitutional
matter,
there's
a
difference
between
one
thing
and
another
of
what
you
can
search
for.
one
not
to
be
reasonable,
one
that
might
not
be
reasonable,
it
might
not
be
reasonable
to
search
and
seizure
of
private
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
tenable
you
don't
have
to
go
all
the
way
for
this
–
on
the
word
unreasonable.
that
has
no
--
that
has
no
very
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
able
to
seize
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
notified
in
advance
that
they
intend
to
use
this
kind
of
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
statutory
ban
on
constituting
the
police
revealing
this
information
that
maybe
that
they
then
have
seen
on
tapes
except
in
connection
with
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
it
didn't
even
hear
both
into
the
telephone
conversation,
it
just
--
it
just
heard
what
was
said
in
the
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
have
the
same
reaction,
if
mr.
steinman
after
say
the
first
--
first
event
or
first
business
arrangement
with
the
police
and
then
begin
working
with
the
police
and
--
but
no
one
knew
it.
and
he
--
and
he
sat
in
his
own
office
or
in
mr.
neyer's
office
and
had
conversations
with
many
people
and
reported
them
to
the
police.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
that
be
--
you
would
--
with
or
without
a
warrant,
i
supposed
you
would
say
that
word
unconstitutional
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
went
to
mr.
neyer's
office,
would
that
be
a
trespass?
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
made
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
trespasser
or
not,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
want
to
know
that
you
would
find
it's
constitutionally
intolerable
whether
steinman
had
conversations
in
his
own
office
or
in
neyer's
office,
as
long
as
he
was
working
with
the
police
and
the
others
didn't
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
be
true
whether
he
carries
a
“minifon”
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
have
the
same
reaction,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
quite
willing
to
assume
that
the
police
--
that
the
police
did
something
here
which
without
the
order
would
be
trespass?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
i
mean,
that's
what
you
--
so
we
can
assume
that
there
was
a
--
this
criminal
trespass
absent
the
orders
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
really
--
you
can
go
ahead
but
that
--
what
--
is
there
really
anything
seized
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
--
what
if
the
police
--
what
if
the
warrant
authorized
the
policeman
to
hide
in
the
closet?
they
had
no
recording
device
or
anything
else,
they
just
listened
and
came
out
to
testified
to
what
he
heard,
is
there
a
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
--
does
it
make
any
difference
though?
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
there
wasn't
any
seizure,
you
still
got
the
same
problem,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
there's
no
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
–
that's
what
i
say
you
still
have
the
same
thing
left
even
if
you
say
there
isn't
anything
--
there
isn't
any
seizure.
the
fact
that
there's
evidence
offered
and
testimony
offered,
it
doesn't
mean
there
was
a
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
seizure
to
file
in
the
--
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
and
there
could
be
a
search
that
but
no
seizure
or
whatsoever
that
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
don't
--
this
doesn't
appear
to
me
that
it
makes
much
difference
when
you
call
a
seizure,
not
as
you
saw
this
thing
problem
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
is
not
about
seizure
then?
justice

people
from

it's
not

and
i
suppose
that
a
policeman
that
just
walks
through
a
door
without
a
warrant
with
no
probable
cause
or
anything
else
or
didn't
report
that
walked
through
the

nothing

nothing
there
was
no

anything

might

be

or
something.
justice

successfully

of
the

if

yes,

if

that

would
then
be
--
it
will
be
substituted
with
it.
well,
i
can't
get
it
by
subpoena
because
of
compulsion,
i
will
just
get
a
search
warrant
and
go
get
it.
i
know
it's
[inaudible]

if

yes.

what
if

all
the

says,
“bring
all

and
he
brings
all
the

in

justice

and
that
is
the
compulsion?
justice

against
