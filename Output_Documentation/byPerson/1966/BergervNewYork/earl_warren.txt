do
you
mind
telling
us
what
kind
of
a
device
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
kind
of
a
device
it
was
that
was
used?
chief

earl
warren
bug
is
not
very
descriptive
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
get
the
other
end
of
the
conversation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
authorization
lies
to
get
telephone
conversation,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
an
order
of
this
kind
is
made,
is
there
any
requirement
for
return
to
be
made
to
the
court
of
what
--
what
was
found
or
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
what
is
the
recordation
of
this
--
of
this
order?
where
--
where
does
it
take
place
and
under
what
circumstances
can
it
be
determined?
what's
in
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
is
no
public
record
made
of
the
fact
that
an
order
of
this
kind
was
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
is
entirely
a
star
chamber
proceeding.
there
is
no
--
no
public
record
made
to
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
an
order
was
entered
ever?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
the
situation
that
justice
white
put
to
you,
there
would
be
no
trespass,
would
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
stop
putting
it
in
mr.
steinman's
office
where
he
turns
state
evidence
and
was
willing
that
the
--
that
the
person
or
the
electronic
device
be
put
in
this
room.
there
is
a
difference
there
because
there
would
be
no
trespass
as
to
steinman,
would
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
all
i
was
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
uviller
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
have
a
recess
now.[recess]
mr.
uviller,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
--
even
though
that
is
true,
why
shouldn't
there
be
some
record
made
of
what
was
obtained
and
have
that
made
a
public
record?
they
could
provide
that
it
couldn't
be
opened
unless
and
--
unless
it
became
necessary
in
some
proceeding
or
something,
but
why
wouldn't
they'd
be
entitled,
if
it's
a
search
and
seizure,
why
wouldn't
that
be
entitled
under
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
one
gets
on
a
search
warrant?
but
here
although
there
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
judges
around
the
state
and
thousands
of
police
officers
who
can
engage
in
this
traffic
and
not
one
of
them
is
subjected
to
any
supervision
in
the
manner
in
which
he
did
it.
now,
do
you
think
that
comports
with
due
process?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
a
man
goes
to
trial,
does
he
know
whether
there
has
been
one
of
those
orders
made
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
order
filed
in
the
proceedings
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
he
can
say,
well,
they
did
have
my
room
wired
up
and
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
they
did
there
and
how
they
got
it,
and
so
forth.
is
that
in
the
record
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
court
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
where
its
--
where
that
testimony
is
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
by
that
does
he
have
to
call
the
witnesses
and
ask
them
what
they
heard
over
this
time
or
how
does
he
get
that
information
with
his
motion
to
suppress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
why
--
just
why
doesn't
he
have
standing,
i
didn't
quite
get
that?
chief
