they

justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
point
is
the

william

but
not

but
i
gather
mr.

this

have

without
any

to

it
might
have
been
housed
somewhere
else
in

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
brill
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
record
as
to
how
the
thing
was
put
in
each
of
the
group,
who
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
they
get
in?
how
did
they
get
into
the
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
it
does
not
appear
that
his
entry
in
either
instances
was
on
the
authority
of
the
landlord
or
owner
of
the
building
or
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
basis
for
an
inference
of
the
trespass
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
it
is
only
those
as
far
as
the
tenants
are
concerned
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
authority
in
any
event
i
gather
for
those
entries
of
the
orders
that
you
referred
us
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
--
they
don't
say
anything
about
how
they
get
in,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
authorize
--
authorize
in
the
power
to
overhear
and
record
by
means
of
any
instruments,
what
may
take
place,
but
nothing
about
any
authority
to
go
in
no
matter
how
you
get
in,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brill,
does
new
york
have
a
statute
comparable
with
the
federal
3109
requiring
the
before
service
of
a
warrant,
notice
of
entry
and
announcement
of
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
apply
with
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well,
if
that's
the
content
that
just
picked
up
while
the
conversations
that
didn't
deal
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
only
prosecutions
that
came
out
of
the
whole
business
are
the
ones
that
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
you
are
coming
separately
to
the
business
is
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
you
tell
us
that
there's
no
limitation
whatever,
just
a
general
get
what
you
can
and
it
may
develop
many
or
no
crime,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
well,
i
suppose
you
tell
us
on
the
probable
cause
whether
there's
any
requirement
of
pinpointing
some
particular
crime
you
apprehend,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
applications
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
other
words,
suppose
instead
of
an
order
that
put
this
eavesdropping
mechanism,
the
order
was
hide
a
policemen
the
closet
in
the
neyer's
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
thought
you
are
emphasizing
that
this
is
if
i've
forgotten
your
word
trespass
or
something
rather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
trespassory
invasion
and
i
take
it,
well,
they're
authorized
the
mechanical
device
or
a
police
officer
in
the
closet
it
would
still
have
the
aspect
with
trespassory
invasion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
pardon
at
this
stage
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
pardon,
--
no
mr.
pardon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
with
this.
suppose
this
had
been
--
every
fact
we
had
in
the
silverman
except
that
you
had
a
court
order,
i
gather
under
the
statute,
the
police
would
have
been
free
to
use
the
silverman
type
of
device
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
--
suppose
we
had
everything
except
the
--
here
we
got
the
court
order,
you'd
still
say,
“silverman
is
not
trespassory?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
in
fact
--
well,
i
mean
you
say
the
order
for,
i
had
trouble,
i
must
say,
seeing
whether
there's
anything
in
this
order
which
says
to
a
policeman
you
can
drive
a
spike
mic
into
mr.
neyer's
office
wall.
i
don't
know
how
you
find
that
in
there
but
do
you
tell
me
that's
what
--
that's
interpreted
to
me,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
don't
we
know
how
the
police
did
this?
why
--
why
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
getting
--
in
getting
--
now,
just
getting
into
the
place
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
–
just
getting
into
the
place
that
they
must
have
got
a
key
or
they
broke
the
door
down
or
something
to
take
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
legalized
burglary
is
that
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
trespass
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
that
this
could
have
happened
in
my
house
if
i
lived
in
new
york,
maybe
i'm
glad
that
i
don't
[laughter]
but
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
could
it
happen
--
could
they
--
could
one
of
these
orders
authorize
the
same
thing
in
my
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
if
what
--
what
to
get
in
the
way
of
conversation
proves
an
entirely
different
crime
from
that
--
for
which
you
got
the
authorization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wonder
in
this
case,
suppose
they
turned
up
some
conversation
of
confession
to
a
murder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
another
case,
what
would
new
york
do
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
prosecute
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
to
include
of
an
illegal
search
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
will
--
would
there
be
a
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
example,
would
your
–
i
thought
they
asked
this
question
yesterday
mr.
uviller,
would
your
principle
go
as
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
search
warrant,
probable
cause,
properly
issued
and
all
the
rest
of
it
could
reach
as
the
only
evidence
involved
against
the
accused,
his
own
confession
which
he
happened
to
hide
in
the
desk
door
beside
to
abandon
with
some
made
sort
there
and
it's
all
of
the
face
friend
and
then
they
went
out
and
get
along?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
reached
out
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
it
can't,
but
you
can't
avoid
it.
you
got
to
reach
that
case
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
assume
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
he
--
then
he's
the
only
one
who
knows
anything
about
the
crime
and
here's
the
record
confessing
to
it,
changes
his
mind
and
puts
those
on
desk
drawer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
this
--
this
i
take
it
as
if
they'll
--
i
mailed
a
letter
to
you
and
you
--
but
--
isn't
those
–
think
the
other
case
a
little
bit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
really
didn't
think
that
there's
absolutely
no
place
or
whatever
for
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though,
there
--
they've
tried
to
reach
it
through
a
search
warrant
rather
than
a
subpoena
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
the
case
where
you
try
to
reach
something
which
was
in
fact
compelled
by
confession,
i
think,
but
you
reach
it
all
with
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
if
he
responds
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
compulsion
of
the
subpoena
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
it
is
central
to
your
argument
even
on
that
approach
that
you
something
about
the
gouled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gouled,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
about
that.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
reason.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
he
find
out
about
in
the
first
instance?
i
don't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
how
is
that
--
i
mean,
is
there
anything
by
statute
which
requires
that
or
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
no
--
i'm
--
i'm
representing
--
i
have
no
idea
where
the
state
got
its
evidence.
i
don't
know
anything
about
this?
i'm
representing
the
--
how
do
i
get
--
you
know
i'm
representing
someone
who's
under
indictment
or
information.
how
do
i
get
notice
of
the
fact?
that's
what
i
want.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
there's
no
statute,
i
take
it
the
practice
must
differ
by
counties.
this
maybe
so
in
new
york
county,
but
not
necessarily
in
queens
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
by
--
is
that
by
decision
or
by
statutory
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
this
we
stick
to
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
mean
that's
all
we
go
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
there
--
by
being
there
you
mean,
just
the
appropriate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
mean
just
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
did
you
get
to
--
how
did
you
get
to
notice
here
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
to
take
the
initiative,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
the
--
did
the
prosecution
after
you
filed
the
motion
just
what
would
say,
that's
right
there
it
is
or
you
have
to
get
a
judge
to
tell
him
co-partner
if
you
get
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
was
going
to
get
--
you
got
the
indication
how,
because
the
judge
ordered
the
prosecution
to
give
you
something
or
because
the
prosecution
voluntarily
gave?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brill,
may
i
ask,
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
none
of
your
fourth
amendment
argument
rests
on
any
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
warrant
clause,
as
required
to
the
clause
itself,
the
service
of
a
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
make
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
it
does.
but
you
don't
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
clause
requires
the
actual
service
of
a
warrant.
here
of
course,
there
wasn't
any
service.
a
warrant
is
obtained
and
it's
executed
in
the
way
we
now
understand
it
was
executed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
are
you
arguing
that
there
can
be
compliance
with
the
warrant
clause,
however,
proper
the
warrant,
however,
much
the
problem
it
caused,
there
can
be
compliance
with
the
warrant
clause,
only
if
also
the
service
upon
somebody
to
warrant,
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
picked
up
conversations
in
room,
not
of
telephone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
point
is
the
pick
up
device
was
housed
in
the
telephone
equipment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
as
part
of

but
i
gather
mr.

this
could
have

without

what

is
there
any
basis
for
an

of
the
trespass
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
it
is
only
those
as
far
as
the
tenants
are
concerned
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
authority
in
any

i
gather
for
those
entries
of
the
orders
that

referred

justice
william
j.

they
--
they
don't
say
anything
about

do
they?
justice
william

just
authorize

there's
no
pardon
at
this
stage
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
pardon,
--
no
mr.
pardon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
with
this.
suppose
this
had
been
--
every
fact
we
had
in
the
silverman
except
that
you
had
a
court
order,
i
gather
under
the
statute,
the
police
would
have
been
free
to
use
the
silverman
type
of
device
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
--
suppose
we
had
everything
except
the
--
here
we
got
the
court
order,
you'd
still
say,
“silverman
is
not
trespassory?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
in
fact
--
well,
i
mean
you
say
the
order
for,
i
had
trouble,
i
must
say,
seeing
whether
there's
anything
in
this
order
which
says
to
a
policeman
you
can
drive
a
spike
mic
into
mr.
neyer's
office
wall.
i
don't
know
how
you
find
that
in
there
but
do
you
tell
me
that's
what
--
that's
interpreted
to
me,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
don't
we
know
how
the
police
did
this?
why
--
why
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
getting
--
in
getting
--
now,
just
getting
into
the
place
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
–
just
getting
into
the
place
that
they
must
have
got
a
key
or
they
broke
the
door
down
or
something
to
take
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
legalized
burglary
is
that
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
trespass
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
that
this
could
have
happened
in
my
house
if
i
lived
in
new
york,
maybe
i'm
glad
that
i
don't
[laughter]
but
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
could
it
happen
--
could
they
--
could
one
of
these
orders
authorize
the
same
thing
in
my
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
if
what
--
what
to
get
in
the
way
of
conversation
proves
an
entirely
different
crime
from
that
--
for
which
you
got
the
authorization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wonder
in
this
case,
suppose
they
turned
up
some
conversation
of
confession
to
a
murder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
another
case,
what
would
new
york
do
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
prosecute
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
to
include
of
an
illegal
search
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
will
--
would
there
be
a
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
example,
would
your
–
i
thought
they
asked
this
question
yesterday
mr.
uviller,
would
your
principle
go
as
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
search
warrant,
probable
cause,
properly
issued
and
all
the
rest
of
it
could
reach
as
the
only
evidence
involved
against
the
accused,
his
own
confession
which
he
happened
to
hide
in
the
desk
door
beside
to
abandon
with
some
made
sort
there
and
it's
all
of
the
face
friend
and
then
they
went
out
and
get
along?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
reached
out
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
it
can't,
but
you
can't
avoid
it.
you
got
to
reach
that
case
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
assume
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
he
--
then
he's
the
only
one
who
knows
anything
about
the
crime
and
here's
the
record
confessing
to
it,
changes
his
mind
and
puts
those
on
desk
drawer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
this
--
this
i
take
it
as
if
they'll
--
i
mailed
a
letter
to
you
and
you
--
but
--
isn't
those
–
think
the
other
case
a
little
bit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
really
didn't
think
that
there's
absolutely
no
place
or
whatever
for
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though,
there
--
they've
tried
to
reach
it
through
a
search
warrant
rather
than
a
subpoena
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
the
case
where
you
try
to
reach
something
which
was
in
fact
compelled
by
confession,
i
think,
but
you
reach
it
all
with
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
if
he
responds
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
compulsion
of
the
subpoena
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
it
is
central
to
your
argument
even
on
that
approach
that
you
something
about
the
gouled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gouled,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
about
that.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
reason.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
he
find
out
about
in
the
first
instance?
i
don't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
how
is
that
--
i
mean,
is
there
anything
by
statute
which
requires
that
or
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
no
--
i'm
--
i'm
representing
--
i
have
no
idea
where
the
state
got
its
evidence.
i
don't
know
anything
about
this?
i'm
representing
the
--
how
do
i
get
--
you
know
i'm
representing
someone
who's
under
indictment
or
information.
how
do
i
get
notice
of
the
fact?
that's
what
i
want.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
there's
no
statute,
i
take
it
the
practice
must
differ
by
counties.
this
maybe
so
in
new
york
county,
but
not
necessarily
in
queens
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
by
--
is
that
by
decision
or
by
statutory
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
this
we
stick
to
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
mean
that's
all
we
go
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
there
--
by
being
there
you
mean,
just
the
appropriate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
mean
just
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
did
you
get
to
--
how
did
you
get
to
notice
here
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
to
take
the
initiative,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
the
--
did
the
prosecution
after
you
filed
the
motion
just
what
would
say,
that's
right
there
it
is
or
you
have
to
get
a
judge
to
tell
him
co-partner
if
you
get
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
was
going
to
get
--
you
got
the
indication
how,
because
the
judge
ordered
the
prosecution
to
give
you
something
or
because
the
prosecution
voluntarily
gave?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brill,
may
i
ask,
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
none
of
your
fourth
amendment
argument
rests
on
any
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
warrant
clause,
as
required
to
the
clause
itself,
the
service
of
a
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
make
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
it
does.
but
you
don't
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
clause
requires
the
actual
service
of
a
warrant.
here
of
course,
there
wasn't
any
service.
a
warrant
is
obtained
and
it's
executed
in
the
way
we
now
understand
it
was
executed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
are
you
arguing
that
there
can
be
compliance
with
the
warrant
clause,
however,
proper
the
warrant,
however,
much
the
problem
it
caused,
there
can
be
compliance
with
the
warrant
clause,
only
if
also
the
service
upon
somebody
to
warrant,
are
you
arguing
that?
