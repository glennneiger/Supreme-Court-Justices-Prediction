mr.
joseph
e.
brill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
client,
ralph
berger
was
convicted
in
a
state
prosecution
for
conspiracy
to
bribe
the
chairman
of
the
new
york
state
liquor
authority.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
in
each
instance
without
opinion.
however,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
judge
--
chief
judge
desmond
and
judge
fold,
now
chief
judge
fold
dissented
in
an
opinion
which
appears
at
page
691
of
the
record
here.
the
questions
before
this
court
as
limited
by
the
order
allowing
certiorari
are
found
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
they
involve
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
state
permissive
eavesdrop
statute
and
on
the
assumption
of
constitutionality
of
such
statute
whether
the
ex
parte
orders
for
secret
electronic
bugging
were
made
on
adequate
showing
of
probable
cause.
prior
to
the
trial,
a
motion
was
made
on
behalf
of
petitioner
to
suppress
evidence
and
leads
thereto
on
the
ground
that
the
same
were
obtained
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
by
trespassory
electronic
bugging
of
constitutionally
protected
areas.
that
motion
to
suppress
was
denied,
was
lead
to
renew
before
the
trial
court.
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
during
the
proceedings
under
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress,
the
parties
entered
into
a
stipulation
under
which
it
was
agreed
that
without
the
evidence
and
the
leads
obtained
from
the
electronic
eavesdrop
devices
placed
in
certain
private
offices,
there
was
no
information
to
present
to
a
grand
jury
or
on
the
basis
of
which
to
prosecute
the
petitioner
and
that
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
leads
thereto
were
activities
at
those
two
locations.
the
electronic
bugs
in
those
private
offices
were
installed
under
authorizing
officers
--
orders,
i
beg
your
pardon,
issued
ex
parte
by
a
state
judge
pursuant
to
section
813
(a)
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure.
those
orders
made
on
april
10,
1962
and
of
june
16,
1962
for
the
separate
premises
involved,
permitted
the
prosecutor,
his
agents,
and
police
working
under
his
direction,
and
i
quote
“to
overhear
and
record
by
means
of
any
instrument,
any
and
all
conversations,
communications
and
discussions,
that
may
take
place
between
the
persons
present
in
the
above
mentioned
room
and
to
do
all
things
necessary
to
permit
said
conversations,
communications,
and
discussions
to
be
overheard
and
recorded.”
the
ex
parte
orders
renewed
the
eavesdropping
for
60
days
and
were
thereafter
renewed
for
additional
similar
periods.
later
in
my
discussion
i
shall
advert
to
the
--
in
detail
to
the
question
as
to
whether
they
were
submitted
to
the
judge
who
made
the
orders,
adequate
proof
to
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment
of
our
federal
constitution.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
approximately
four
months
mr.
justice
harlan
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
a
bug
placed
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
microphone
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
not
a
wire
tap
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
a
microphone
concealed
in
a
telephone
box
such
as
it's
usually
covering
the
type
of
telephonic
equipment
found
in
any
home
or
any
private
office
connected
to
unused
telephone
wires,
run
through
those
unused
telephone
wires
into
another
building
where
a
listening
post
had
been
established
and
where
those
unused
telephone
wires
were
then
connected
to
a
recording
device,
a
recorder.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
it
was
not
intended
to
be
a
wire
tap,
i
must
acknowledge.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
has
surely
did
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
picked
up
everything
in
the
room,
including
telephone
conversation.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
indeed
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
indeed
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
not
restricted
to
anything,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
heard
all
that
was
said
in
the
room
presumptively
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
on
the
telephone,
i
would
have
to
say,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
got
that
which
was
said
in
part
incidentally
the
recording
itself
was
inaudible.
it
was
--
as
i
characterized
in
the
trial
court,
“gobble
de
goo.”
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
anything
have
it
except
as
it
was
put
together
in
the
course
of
the
thousands
of
playings
of
the
recording
by
the
district
attorney's
office
and
the
police
squad
attached
to
it
in
order
to
make
a
transcript
which
eventually
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
in
order
to
aid
it
in
understanding
what
was
being
said.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
could
have
been
housed
anywhere
in
that
room
secreted
in
any
place
in
the
private
offices
and
could
have
functioned
without
being
concealed
in
the
telephone
box.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
authorization
was
to
get
any
and
all
conversations
which
took
place
in
that
room,
anything
that
was
said
by
anybody
in
that
room
regardless
of
who
that
person
maybe.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
warrant
is
found
at
691
and
6
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
first
warrant
concerning
which
we
complain
is
found
at
680
of
the
record
mr.
justice
douglas
and
the
second
warrant
is
found
at
684
and
in
all
respects
except
for
the
recitals
concerning
the
affidavits
on
the
basis
of
which
the
warrants
were
made,
the
direction
is
the
same.
i
would
like
with
the
court's
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
correct
sir.
that
incidentally
was
the
private
office
of
an
attorney.
the
second
warrant
which
appears
at
684
authorizes
the
taking
of
all
conversations,
any
and
all
conversations
in
room
801
at
15
east
48th
street.
it
also
was
a
private
office
location.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
second
one
was
not,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
second
one
was
the
office
of
a
man
named
harry
steinman,
who
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
in
which
the
eavesdropping
was
conducted
under
the
first
warrant
is
purported
that
to
be
a
person
who
was
to
pay
$30,000.00
for
a
liquor
license.
he
is
described
as
a
liquor
license
applicant.
he
is
later
named
in
the
indictment
itself
as
a
co-defendant.
at
issue
then
firstly
in
this
case
is
whether
the
new
york
ex
parte
judicial
permissive
eavesdrop
statute
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
very
interesting.
it
was
disclosed
at
the
trial
that
a
police
officer
described
as
a
wireman,
surreptitiously
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning,
placed
these
instrumentalities,
the
microphone
which
we
call
the
bug,
in
the
private
offices,
in
which
they
were
located
and
in
at
least
one
instance
the
policeman
made
a
return
visit
to
the
premises.
it's
my
recollection
to
how
it
occurred
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well
we
weren't
permitted
to
show
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
attempted
to
show
that
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
it
was
certainly
not
under
the
authority
of
the
tenant
of
the
building.
it
may
have
been
and
i
have
no
knowledge
with
respect
to
this,
possibly
with
the
consent
of
the
owner
of
the
building,
but
certainly
not
with
the
consent
of
the
tenant
of
each
--
of
either
of
the
premises
which
were
both
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
oh,
clearly,
clearly.
it's
conceded
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
so
far
as
the
tenants
were
concerned
and
with
respect
to
the
particular
premises
in
which
the
microphones
were
concealed.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
only
authority
before
the
entry
was
in
fact
the
orders.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
they
say
[attempt
to
laughter]
to
do
anything
that
you
wanted
to
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
do
anything
at
all
to
get
in
and
just
as
long
as
you
get
in
there
and
overhear
any
and
all
conversations
that
may
take
place.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
oh,
no.
mr.
justice
harlan,
nothing
at
all
like
a
search
warrant
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
certainly
not
mr.
justice
clark
and
nobody
had
any
idea
that
this
surreptitious
activity
was
being
conducted
with
this
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
could
operate
secretly
for
24
hours
a
day
for
a
period
of
60
days
and
then
be
renewed
for
a
like
period.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
douglas.
that
was
the
expiration
date
authorized
by
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
connection
with
a
--
the
--
what
we
understand
to
be
ordinary
search
warrant,
i
believe
there
is
such
requirement
in
law.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
does
not
apply
to
the
circumstances
in
this
case
or
to
the
statute
itself
in
this
case
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
this
particular
case,
it
did
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
this
was
the
picking
up,
the
overhearing
of
all
conversations
in
the
private
offices
concerned
transmitted
through
the
unused
telephone
wires
to
the
listening
post
in
another
location.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
we
were
only
able
and
permitted
to
ascertain
that
it
was
in
another
room
--
it
was
in
a
room
in
another
building
but
the
trial
court
did
not
permit
us
as
i
recall
the
record
to
inquire
us
to
the
location
of
that
other
building.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes
sir.
we
then
present
to
this
court
two
issues.
firstly,
whether
the
new
york
ex
parte
judicial
permissive
eavesdrop
statute
may
constitutionally
authorize
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
as
our
amicus
civil
liberties
union
urges
under
the
first
amendment,
a
trespassory
intrusion
by
electronic
bugging
in
private
premises
to
make
a
general
search
for
evidence
to
support
a
criminal
prosecution.
secondly,
on
the
assumption
that
the
fourth
amendment
constitutionality
of
that
statute
is
satisfied,
where
the
ex
parte
orders
for
those
room
eavesdrops
based
on
an
adequate
showing
of
probable
cause.
it
appears
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
this
court
is
called
upon
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
otherwise
unconstitution
--
constitutional
trespassory
room
bugging
can
be
made
constitutional
by
an
advanced
ex
parte
judicial
order
and
whether
a
state
statute
setting
up
such
a
system
is
constitutional.
the
recent
osborn
decision
does
not
reach
this
issue
and
i
shall
refer
to
osborn
in
my
discussion.
it
is
true
that
in
osborn,
a
form
of
electronic
monitoring
was
approved
on
the
basis
of
advanced
judicial
permission
and
it
is
true
that
in
osborn,
several
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
joined
in
the
decision
apparently
because
this
judicial
permission
was
deemed
to
remove
the
constitutional
objections
under
the
particular
facts
in
that
case.
in
the
first
place,
osborn
involved
a
“minifon”
device
and
not
a
surreptitious
intrusion.
the
“minifon”
problem
has
always
until
now
been
regarded
by
this
court
differently
from
the
trespassory
room
bug.
minifon
type
activity
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
on
lee
and
lopez
cases.
trespassory
room
bugging
has
been
disapproved
since
the
silverman
decision.
it
cannot
be
argued
from
this
that
the
factor
of
advanced
judicial
permission
in
the
osborn
“minifon”
situation
where
the
justices
who
had
dissented
or
otherwise
differed
from
the
majority
in
on
lee
and
lopez
joined
in
the
osborn
majority.
it
cannot
be
argued
from
this
that
osborn
has
settled
for
all
purposes
and
for
all
types
of
electronic
monitoring,
the
problem
of
advanced
judicial
permission
as
a
cure
or
otherwise
unconstitutional
electronic
eavesdropping.
aside
from
the
distinction
between
a
“minifon”
device
and
a
room
bug
in
private
premises,
osborn
is
distinguishable
from
our
case
on
several
other
grounds.
and
osborn
fails
to
solve
the
entire
problem
of
advanced
judicial
permission
for
several
other
reasons.
we
have
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
brief
at
pages
58
--
55
to
58,
the
several
distinguishing
points
affecting
osborn.
above
all,
there
is
the
matter
of
specifically
limiting
the
monitoring
--
the
electronic
monitoring
which
it
was
possible
to
do
in
osborn
where
they
were
aiming
at
a
specific
scheduled
conversation
to
be
held
at
a
specific
time.
but
how
can
this
be
remotely
compared
to
a
60-day
general
room
bugging
order
to
overhear
all
conversations
in
a
private
place?
whatever
principles
or
standards
maybe
derived
from
the
forms
of
the
judicial
permission
which
was
approved
in
osborn,
those
principles
and
standards
cannot
possibly
be
satisfied
by
813
(a)
of
the
new
york
statute
and
they
have
not
been
satisfied
in
this
case.
since
osborn
then
does
not
reach
the
question
of
advanced
judicial
permission
for
trespassory
bugging,
we
must
in
this
case
explore
an
uncharted
sea,
that
is,
we
have
no
guidance
from
any
decision
of
this
court
with
the
exception
that
i
will
mention
to
help
determine
what
kind
of
judicial
permission
for
trespassory
bugging
might
be
constitutionally
acceptable
or
indeed
where
there
any
kind
of
judicial
permission
can
constitutionally
be
devised
for
trespassory
bugging.
i
just
mentioned
that
some
guidance
has
been
offered
in
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
i
was
referring
to
the
discussion
of
mr.
justice
lopez
--
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
lopez
case,
but
the
point
was
not
pursued
to
conclusion
in
that
discussion.
it
was
expressly
left
for
a
later
day.
this
case
brings
us
to
that
day.
the
immediate
question
in
this
case
is
whether
new
york
state
found
a
constitutional
solution
for
the
problem
of
judicial
permission?
may
i
read
excerpts
from
the
new
york
statute?
an
ex
parte
order
for
eavesdropping
maybe
issued
by
any
justice
of
the
supreme
court
upon
oath
or
affirmation
of
a
district
attorney,
or
of
the
attorney
general,
or
an
officer
above
the
rank
of
sergeant
of
any
police
department
of
the
state,
or
of
any
political
subdivision
thereof,
that
there
is
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
evidence
of
crime
maybe
thus
obtained,
and
particularly
describing
the
person
or
persons
whose
communications,
conversations,
or
discussions
are
to
be
overheard
or
recorded
and
the
purpose
thereof.
any
such
order
together
with
the
papers
upon
which
the
application
was
based,
shall
be
delivered
to
and
retained
by
the
applicant
as
authority
for
the
eavesdropping
authorized
therein.
a
true
copy
of
such
order
shall
at
all
times
be
retained
in
his
possession
by
the
judge
or
justice
issuing
the
same.
as
applied
in
this
case
through
the
eavesdrop
orders
that
were
issued,
the
statute
as
i've
already
indicated
was
given
its
maximum
scope.
the
eavesdropping
was
permitted
for
60
days
and
then
for
renewed
periods
of
60
days.
it
was
permitted
on
an
outright
trespassory
basis
in
private
room
premises.
it
was
permitted
to
be
done
as
a
deliberate,
unrestricted
search
for
evidence
of
any
crime,
and
while
i
pass
for
the
moment
full
details
as
to
probable
cause,
i
note
here
that
the
warrants
used
for
electronic
search
were
wholly
unlimited
in
the
sense
that
they
bore
no
relation
to
the
alleged
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
there
is
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
not
embraced
within
this
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
the
proceedings
on
the
motion
to
renew
mr.
justice
fortas,
all
of
the
reels
of
tape
which
were
taken
at
the
listening
posts,
were
produced
in
court
marked
as
exhibits
and
in
a
dry
run
before
the
court
at
which
time
they
were
present,
actually
attempting
to
record
what
was
being
reproduced,
three
certified
court
reporters,
who
attempted
to
make
transcripts
of
that
which
was
being
reproduced.
as
a
result
of
the
dry
run
before
the
trial
court
except
for
one
reel
which
became
exhibit
61
(a)
in
the
trial,
all
of
the
others
were
excluded
on
various
grounds
suggested
and
stated
by
the
trial
judge.
primarily,
they
were
held
to
be
a
material,
irrelevant,
no
probative
value,
and
they
were
also
inaudible
and
impossible
to
understand.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
was
an
attempted
recording
of
everything
that
was
said
by
anybody
who
was
in
either
of
the
bugged
premises.
that
was
what
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
total
number
of
prosecutions.
there
have
been
several
and
on
several
grounds.
i
understand
that
there
have
been
some
perjury
indictments.
i
understand
that
there
have
been
other
indictments.
there
was
at
least
one
other
indictment
charging
a
conspiracy
to
bribe
perhaps
to
conspiracy
to
bribe
officials
of
the
new
york
state
liquor
authority.
and
i
am
not
entirely
clear
as
to
the
details
with
respect
to
the
bugging
or
the
wiretapping
in
each
of
those
cases,
but
i
am
satisfied,
for
example
that,
there
is
presently
pending
an
indictment
in
new
york
involving
the
attorney
harry
neyer,
whose
premises
were
a
bugged
under
the
april
12,
1962
order
on
the
basis
of
which
it
is
said
that
there
was
a
development
in
which
he
in
a
telephone
conversation
with
a
petitioner
in
this
case
led
to
further
activities.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
that
--
it
does
in
fact
create
problems
because
under
the
statute,
a
copy
of
the
order
is
given
to
the
eavesdropper
and
a
copy
of
the
order
at
all
times
is
retained
in
his
possession
by
the
issuing
judge.
there
is
no
central
place
in
which
it
is
filed
and
there's
no
disclosure
with
respect
to
with
having
them
made
or
having
them
filed
unless
and
until
usually
by
accident
it
comes
to
light
or
by
reason
of
the
constant
probing
and
the
questions
that
are
put
by
diligent
counsel,
it
becomes
developed
and
then
only
can
the
proceedings
be
developed
in
respect
of
them.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
ex
parte
orders
mr.
chief
justice
are
entirely
secret
and
are
not
made
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
until
such
time
as
there's
had
a
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
such
emotion
as
the
motions
which
i
made,
a
motion
which
i
made
in
this
case.
the
district
attorney
in
responding
to
the
motion
makes
his
argument
and
proof
maybe
taken.
in
this
case,
the
necessity
for
taking
proof
was
obviated
because
of
the
stipulation
which
was
entered
into
between
the
district
attorney
and
myself
in
which
it
was
agreed
that
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
leads
came
from
the
trespassory
bugging
in
these
private
offices
and
without
that
evidence
and
without
those
leads,
there
would
be
no
case
on
which
the
prosecution
could
have
gone
forward.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
couldn't
possibly
be
better
characterized,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
what
ostensibly
started
as
a
--
as
probable
cause
in
regard
to
liquor
license
corruption
culminated
in
electronic
search
warrants
not
limited
to
any
specific
crime
or
to
any
named
person,
or
to
any
time
except
as
i
said
before
for
the
expiration
date
allowed
by
the
statute,
namely
60
days.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
am
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
will.
i
will
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
there
is
ever
going
to
be
a
statutory
system
of
curing
unconstitutional
electronic
eavesdropping
through
the
cure
of
advanced
judicial
permission
and
anyone
believes
it
will
be
this
statute
or
one
like
it.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
brief
that
no
system
of
judicial
permission
can
be
constitutionally
devised
for
this
area
except
perhaps
and
i
emphasized
perhaps
for
the
case
of
supreme
public
emergency
and
then
only
for
security
and
not
for
prosecutorial
purposes.
in
order
for
this
particular
case
to
be
reversed
by
this
court,
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
court
agree
with
this
in
this
broad
policy
position
suggested
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
that
useful
lines
of
analysis
are
opened
up
in
our
suggestion
which
can
be
helpful
in
deciding
this
case.
for
example,
should
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
be
subject
to
judicially
permitted
electronic
intrusion
without
limit
as
to
what
kind
of
crime
the
police
eavesdropper
is
seeking?
the
new
york
statute
is
unlimited
in
this
respect.
for
example
also,
should
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
be
subjected
to
judicially
permitted
intrusion
without
even
defining
at
all
in
the
judicial
warrant,
what
private
conversations
criminal
or
non-criminal
maybe
be
searched?
is
that
the
way
it
was
done
in
osborn?
the
new
york
statute,
however,
permits
such
search
and
indeed,
it
makes
it
inevitable.
it
seems
to
us
indisputable
that
this
particular
statute
goes
too
far
by
any
rational
standard
of
our
privacy
traditions
under
the
constitution.
the
argument
on
this
point
could
end
here
without
going
on
to
ask,
what
kind
of
a
better
statute
might
satisfy
the
constitution?
we
take
it
that
the
court
maybe
interested
in
having
us
explore
the
question
in
its
broader
extensions
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
included
in
our
brief
a
discussion
of
the
broader
policy
implications
of
judicially
permitted
electronic
eavesdropping.
and
the
conclusion
which
we
have
proposed
is
again
that
no
system
of
judicial
permission
can
satisfy
the
constitution
for
any
case
of
electronic
search
where
the
purpose
is
criminal
prosecution.
i've
asked
myself
whether
some
position
short
of
this
perhaps
could
be
worked
out
to
allow
judicially
permitted
electronic
eavesdropping
for
criminal
prosecutions
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
constitutionally,
logical
or
palatable
answer
short
of
outright
ban.
one
reason,
why
we
have
believe
that
necessary
to
formulate
our
position
is
the
advent
of
the
age
of
the
parabolic
microphone
and
no
one
knows
what
has
yet
to
come?
i
have
not
yet
touched
on
the
subject
of
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination.
the
court
is
frequently
spoken
of
the
interplay
feature
as
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
the
indiscriminate
character
of
electronic
room
bugging
and
the
warrants
in
this
case,
make
it
inevitable
that
fifth
amendment
rights
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment
rights
are
immediately
threatened.
the
rights
are
threatened
both
through
the
general
search
that
is
intrinsically
involved
in
any
such
indiscriminate
room
bugging
and
they
are
threatened
even
more
acutely
in
this
case
by
the
search
for
mere
evidence.
in
fact,
the
search
for
mere
evidence
is
the
expressly
declared
purpose
under
the
new
york
statute
and
under
the
warrants
issued
in
this
case.
i
come
now
to
our
second
point,
that
is,
assuming
the
federal
constitutionality
of
section
813,
we
asked
whether
the
ex
parte
eavesdropping
orders
authorizing
the
intrusion
nevertheless
are
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
were
not
based
upon
an
adequate
showing
of
probable
clause.
these
ex
parte
orders
here
were
secured
on
application
to
a
judge
under
the
provision
of
that
statute
813
(a).
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
they
are,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
applications
in
support
of
the
first
order
made
on
attorney
neyer's
offices,
with
respect
to
attorney
neyer's
offices
appear
at
681
to
683
inclusive
of
the
record
and
the
applications
in
support
of
the
second
eavesdrop
order
on
the
premises
of
steinman
appear
at
pages
685
to
687
inclusive
of
the
record.
we
take
the
position
that
the
record
of
the
proceedings
on
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress
before
the
trial
judge,
fails
to
establish
that
any
sworn
testimony
or
evidence
was
adduced
before
him
indicating
that
any
showing
or
presentation
was
made
to
the
issuing
judge
beyond
the
affidavits
recited
in
the
orders
as
the
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
neyer
and
steinman
eavesdropping.
the
validity
of
the
orders
then
must
stand
on
the
record
made
before
the
issuing
judge.
and
as
your
honors
can
see
that
record
in
the
case
of
each
order
consisted
only
of
the
affidavits
of
two
assistant
district
attorneys
in
the
application
for
and
in
each
instance
the
order
itself.
the
affidavits,
primarily
the
affidavit
made
by
mr.
mccanna
which
is
adopted
by
reference,
by
mr.
scotti,
in
the
neyer's
eavesdrop,
rarely
--
merely
recite
in
conclusory
fashion
that
the
affiance
have
“information”
and
“evidence”
that
a
conspiracy
exists
to
force
persons
seeking
to
obtain
or
retain
liquor
licenses
to
pay
large
sums
of
money
for
them.
and
that
harry
neyer,
an
attorney,
must
be
engaged
to
carry
the
bribe
or
extortion
money
to
the
state
liquor
authority
official.
no
facts
are
set
forth
concerning
what
information
or
evidence
is
alleged
to
be
in
the
prosecutor's
possession,
or
the
source
of
that
information
or
evidence,
or
the
reliability
of
the
source.
the
order
itself
asserts
that
it
was
made
on
the
affidavits
of
the
two
assistant
district
attorneys
and
makes
no
reference
to
“minifons”
or
any
other
information
or
evidence.
in
the
application
in
support
of
the
second
steinman
eavesdrop
order
except
for
references
to
the
earlier
neyer
eavesdrop,
and
that
from
it
evidence
was
obtained
indicating
that
steinman
had
agreed
to
pay
$30,000.00
to
neyer
to
secure
a
liquor
license,
that
court
was
informed
of
no
more
than
it
was
on
the
neyer
application.
here
again,
no
facts
are
set
forth
in
the
affidavits
identifying
the
persons
from
whom
the
evidence
was
obtained
or
the
reliability
of
such
persons,
or
any
reasons
for
crediting
them.
the
steinman
order
itself
recites
as
does
the
neyer
order
that
it
was
made
on
the
affidavits
of
two
assistant
district
attorneys.
it
likewise
makes
no
reference
to
“minifons”
or
any
other
information
or
evidence.
it
is
apparent
then
that
except
for
a
reference
to
a
prior
eavesdrop
of
attorney
neyer's
office
and
an
innocuous
statement
that
steinman
was
a
prospective
license
applicant
required
to
pay
$30,000.00,
the
allegations
in
support
of
a
steinman
order
are
sheer
unsupported
conclusions
based
on
general
claims
of
information
or
evidence
in
the
prosecutor's
possession.
in
short,
the
affidavits
on
both
applications
furnish
nothing
upon
which
the
magistrate
could
make
an
informed,
and
deliberate
determination
as
required
by
this
court
in
aguilar
v.
texas.
contrast
these
inadequate
affidavits
with
a
meticulous
showing
required
to
be
made
and
in
fact
made
to
the
district
judges
in
osborn,
the
federal
fourth
amendment
decisions
preclude
the
giving
of
any
weight
to
any
after
thought
suggestion
that
the
respondent
could
have
justified
both
eavesdrops
on
the
basis
of
prior
“minifon”
recordings.
indeed,
the
record
keeping
requirements
of
813
(a)
negate
any
possible
intention
by
the
new
york
legislature
that
eavesdropping
when
subjected
to
later
court
review
should
be
sustainable
on
the
basis
of
anything
beyond
what
the
formal
record
itself
states.
i
ask
this
court
to
note
that
the
references
to
prior
“minifons”
and
other
information
now
suggested
as
a
basis
for
probable
cause
was
mentioned
for
the
first
time
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress
before
the
trial
court.
finally
in
view
of
osborn
one
may
ask,
“where
are
the
judicial
permissive
orders
for
the
“minifon”
surveillance
which
the
prosecutor
claims
were
antecedent
to
and
supported
the
application
for
the
room
bugging
orders
in
this
case.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
footnote
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
would
say
mr.
justice
black
that
no
plain
everyday
ordinary
eavesdropping
would
be
permitted
to
be
conducted
under
an
order
for
which
an
application
was
made
to
a
judge
where
the
search
would
be
an
indiscriminate
one
from
mere
evidence
without
regard
to
whose
conversations
were
being
overheard,
without
regard
to
what
crime
if
any
was
being
committed
or
had
been
committed,
i
believe
that
such
an
application
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation
mr.
justice
black,
but
that
would
not
be
our
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
i
feel
that
it
does.
this
court,
however,
in
osborn
felt
that
that
was
proper
under
the
particular
circumstances
in
that
unique
case
which
may
never
again
be
repeated.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
don't
think
that
in
either
instance
there
would
be
a
difference.
i
think
that
in
either
case
such
an
order
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
this
relates
to
eavesdropping
and
i
believe
it
could
issue
under
this
act.
the
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
none
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no,
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
the
statute
is
constitutionally
intolerable
because
it
permits
indiscriminately
any
kind
of
general
search
as
the
statute
authorizes.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
trespassory
invasion
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
would,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
under
such
a
warrant
as
we
have
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
would
say
that
that
too
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable.
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
type
of
situation
which
you
suggest
mr.
justice
white
and
the
situation
which
was
suggested
in
osborn.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
that
situation
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
if
he
went
to
mr.
neyer's
office,
there
might
be
a
trespass.
if
he
conducted
these
conversations
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
there
would
not
in
his
own
office,
mr.
chief
justice,
no.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
i
would
--
i
do
call
that
constitutionally
intolerable
and
i'm
aware
that
--
i'm
aware
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
court
and
myself
in
that
regard.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
true,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
distinction
which
i
made
mr.
justice
white
was
that
if
he
had
the
microphone,
the
concealed
microphone
in
his
own
office,
the
element
of
trespass
would
not
be
involved.
if
on
the
other
hand
he
went
to
mr.
neyer's
office,
secretly
cloaked
with
the
microphone,
the
“minifon”
or
whatever
device
he
maybe
using,
i
think
a
trespass
might
be
involved.
in
short,
as
i
indicated
to
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
sir
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
would
as
i
say
i'm
aware
of
the
difference
between
the
court
and
myself
on
that
regard.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
footnote
75
found
at
page
44
of
the
brief
of
respondent's
amici,
the
attorney
generals
of
massachusetts
and
oregon
and
the
national
district
attorney's
association
in
which
there
is
made
the
tacit
admission
that
the
warrants
in
this
case
were
issued
without
an
adequate
showing
of
probable
cause.
may
i
reserve
10
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
say
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
eavesdropping
orders
become
a
part
of
the
record.
in
my
own
experience
as
both
a
federal
and
state
prosecutor,
i
know
of
no
cases
in
which
notification
of
a
matter
similar
to
this
kind
of
situation
is
given
in
advance
by
the
prosecutor
to
his
adversary
representing
a
defendant
or
a
proposed
defendant.
and
i
am
ready
to
say
and
do
say
now
to
this
court
that
i
know
of
no
case
under
which
an
eavesdropping
order
was
obtained
in
new
york
county
in
which
prior
to
the
trial,
the
district
attorney
advised
defense
counsel
of
the
existence
of
such
order
and
of
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
it
leads
and
evidence
were
obtained.
and
i
say
unqualifiedly
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
by
making
a
motion
to
suppress,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
exactly
so.
we
took
the
initiative.
we
found
by
examining
the
record
in
another
case
that
there
had
been
a
bugging
order
and
evidence
obtained
in
that
case.
that
was
a
case
involving
a
judge
of
the
state
court
of
claims.
in
the
course
of
that
case,
his
counsel,
made
a
motion
and
demanded
a
hearing
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
bugging
order.
it
was
developed
in
the
course
of
that
case
and
from
the
transcript
of
that
case
i
learned
that
in
fact
that
in
that
case
there
had
been
an
eavesdropping
order.
consequently,
i
made
a
motion
on
the
assumption
that
if
there
had
been
in
that
case,
there
might
will
be
one
in
my
case
and
i
discovered
as
a
result
of
making
that
motion
that
there
had
in
fact
been
such
orders
as
we
have
described
here
and
which
are
the
warrants
in
this
case,
which
are
anything
but
from
a
reading
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
regret
to
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
prosecution
gave
me,
no
information
beyond
what
i
already
had
and
they
didn't
give
me
that.
unfortunately,
mr.
uviller,
who
had
no
familiarity
with
the
matter
at
that
posture
of
the
case,
was
not
able
to
furnish
the
court
with
any
of
the
factual
matter
concerning
it.
the
prosecution
gave
us
no
information
at
all.
they
opposed
the
motion
to
suppress
as
the
matter
of
fact.
the
judge
in
the
--
what
is
comfortable
to
special
termed
who
heard
the
motion
denied
it
with
leave
to
renew.
it
was
only
on
the
renewal
that
we
got
any
indication
at
all
of
the
fact
that
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no.
the
prosecution
didn't
voluntarily
do
anything.
if
we
had
not
renewed
the
motion
to
suppress,
if
we
have
waived
it,
if
we
had
gone
ahead
with
the
trial,
we
would
have
heard
nothing
about
it
until
that
posture
in
the
case
when
the
evidence
is
being
offered
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
preliminary
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
--
is
the
preliminary
in
connection
with
the
proceedings
that
were
to
be
held
on
the
renewal
of
the
motion
to
suppress
and
that
is
the
area,
and
to
which
mr.
uviller
refers
when
he
says
the
record
is
cloudy
as
to
what
was
before
the
issuing
judge
at
the
time
the
warrants
were
issued.
it
was
in
the
course
of
the
statement
made
by
the
prosecutor
then
in
connection
with
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress
that
he
told
the
court
that
as
the
genesis
for
these
orders,
there
had
been
a
prior
minifon
surveillance
for
which
incidentally
there
was
no
permissive
judicial
order.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
what
mckenzie
said
at
that
time
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
came
after
i
renewed
the
motion
to
suppress
as
i
had
leave
to
do
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court
which
denied
my
motion
originally.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
that
the
respondents'
brief
reflects
the
number
of
eavesdropping
orders
which
it
obtained
over
period
of
some
six
years.
it
does
not
give
any
indication
of
the
number
of
eavesdrops
which
have
been
carried
on
without
orders.
i
think
that
they
say
they
have
an
average
of
22
orders
per
year
for
the
period
of
six
years
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
would
have
to
come
internally
from
the
prosecutor's
office.
there
are
not
publicly
available
except
as
they
may
have
been
presented
to
a
joint
legislative
committee
investigating
a
whole
subject
of
electronic
intrusions.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
there
in
the
respondents'
brief
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
they
are
at
page
61
mr.
uviller
advices
me.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no,
i
--
we
point
out
of
course
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
say
that
they
cannot
be
a
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
argue
that
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
requirement
--
with
the
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause
under
that
amendment.
now,
the
situation
does
not
permit
itself
to
come
within
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no.
we're
saying
that
even
if
there
were
service,
let
me
withdraw
that
mr.
brennan.
if
there
were
service
of
notice
in
advance
following
the
judicial
permissive
order
as
the
respondent
has
pointed
out,
there
would
be
no
eavesdropping.
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it
cannot
be
separated
that
way
based
upon
the
issue
of
notice
along.
now,
we
--
i
think
that
the
situation
is
aggravated
because
there
can
be
no
notice
because
it
is
surreptitious
and
consequently,
there
can
be
no
knowledge
and
there
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
wanted
in
passing
to
make
a
comment
on
this
issue
of
standing.
the
stipulation
which
was
obtained
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
before
the
trial
court
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
integrated
both
warrants
and
the
proceedings
had
in
connection
with
both
warrants.
there
was
no
separation.
it
was
not
until
after
the
appellate
procedures
were
instituted
that
the
suggestions
was
made
that
the
two
were
separated
and
to
suggest
and
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
standing
with
respect
to
one
but
no
standing
with
the
respect
to
the
order
upon
the
basis
of
which
the
second
order
was
obtained
is
to
request
the
license,
to
permit
the
kind
of
fraudulent
activity
which
police
officers
might
be
capable
of
committing
in
order
to
get
to
the
second
order.
and
i
do
believe
sincerely
that
we
have
the
right
to
attack
the
first
order
and
that
issue
was
before
this
court
on
the
application
for
certiorari.
respondent
raised
the
issue
and
we
interpose
the
reply
brief
in
which
we
discuss
the
matter
in
considerable
detail.
now
the
other
matters
to
which
i
wanted
to
advert
in
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice
are
that
covered
by
our
brief
and
i
will
not
impinge
further
upon
the
time
of
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
client,
ralph
berger
was
convicted
in
a
state
prosecution
for
conspiracy
to
bribe
the
chairman
of
the
new
york
state
liquor
authority.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
in
each
instance
without
opinion.
however,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
judge
--
chief
judge
desmond
and
judge
fold,
now
chief
judge
fold
dissented
in
an
opinion
which
appears
at
page
691
of
the
record
here.
the
questions
before
this
court
as
limited
by
the
order
allowing
certiorari
are
found
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
they
involve
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
state
permissive
eavesdrop
statute
and
on
the
assumption
of
constitutionality
of
such
statute
whether
the
ex
parte
orders
for
secret
electronic
bugging
were
made
on
adequate
showing
of
probable
cause.
prior
to
the
trial,
a
motion
was
made
on
behalf
of
petitioner
to
suppress
evidence
and
leads
thereto
on
the
ground
that
the
same
were
obtained
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
by
trespassory
electronic
bugging
of
constitutionally
protected
areas.
that
motion
to
suppress
was
denied,
was
lead
to
renew
before
the
trial
court.
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
during
the
proceedings
under
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress,
the
parties
entered
into
a
stipulation
under
which
it
was
agreed
that
without
the
evidence
and
the
leads
obtained
from
the
electronic
eavesdrop
devices
placed
in
certain
private
offices,
there
was
no
information
to
present
to
a
grand
jury
or
on
the
basis
of
which
to
prosecute
the
petitioner
and
that
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
leads
thereto
were
activities
at
those
two
locations.
the
electronic
bugs
in
those
private
offices
were
installed
under
authorizing
officers
--
orders,
i
beg
your
pardon,
issued
ex
parte
by
a
state
judge
pursuant
to
section
813
(a)
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure.
those
orders
made
on
april
10,
1962
and
of
june
16,
1962
for
the
separate
premises
involved,
permitted
the
prosecutor,
his
agents,
and
police
working
under
his
direction,
and
i
quote
“to
overhear
and
record
by
means
of
any
instrument,
any
and
all
conversations,
communications
and
discussions,
that
may
take
place
between
the
persons
present
in
the
above
mentioned
room
and
to
do
all
things
necessary
to
permit
said
conversations,
communications,
and
discussions
to
be
overheard
and
recorded.”
the
ex
parte
orders
renewed
the
eavesdropping
for
60
days
and
were
thereafter
renewed
for
additional
similar
periods.
later
in
my
discussion
i
shall
advert
to
the
--
in
detail
to
the
question
as
to
whether
they
were
submitted
to
the
judge
who
made
the
orders,
adequate
proof
to
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment
of
our
federal
constitution.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
approximately
four
months
mr.
justice
harlan
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
a
bug
placed
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
microphone
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
not
a
wire
tap
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
a
microphone
concealed
in
a
telephone
box
such
as
it's
usually
covering
the
type
of
telephonic
equipment
found
in
any
home
or
any
private
office
connected
to
unused
telephone
wires,
run
through
those
unused
telephone
wires
into
another
building
where
a
listening
post
had
been
established
and
where
those
unused
telephone
wires
were
then
connected
to
a
recording
device,
a
recorder.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
it
was
not
intended
to
be
a
wire
tap,
i
must
acknowledge.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
has
surely
did
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
picked
up
everything
in
the
room,
including
telephone
conversation.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
indeed
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
indeed
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
not
restricted
to
anything,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
heard
all
that
was
said
in
the
room
presumptively
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
on
the
telephone,
i
would
have
to
say,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
got
that
which
was
said
in
part
incidentally
the
recording
itself
was
inaudible.
it
was
--
as
i
characterized
in
the
trial
court,
“gobble
de
goo.”
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
anything
have
it
except
as
it
was
put
together
in
the
course
of
the
thousands
of
playings
of
the
recording
by
the
district
attorney's
office
and
the
police
squad
attached
to
it
in
order
to
make
a
transcript
which
eventually
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
in
order
to
aid
it
in
understanding
what
was
being
said.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
exactly
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
could
have
been
housed
anywhere
in
that
room
secreted
in
any
place
in
the
private
offices
and
could
have
functioned
without
being
concealed
in
the
telephone
box.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
authorization
was
to
get
any
and
all
conversations
which
took
place
in
that
room,
anything
that
was
said
by
anybody
in
that
room
regardless
of
who
that
person
maybe.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
warrant
is
found
at
691
and
6
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
first
warrant
concerning
which
we
complain
is
found
at
680
of
the
record
mr.
justice
douglas
and
the
second
warrant
is
found
at
684
and
in
all
respects
except
for
the
recitals
concerning
the
affidavits
on
the
basis
of
which
the
warrants
were
made,
the
direction
is
the
same.
i
would
like
with
the
court's
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
correct
sir.
that
incidentally
was
the
private
office
of
an
attorney.
the
second
warrant
which
appears
at
684
authorizes
the
taking
of
all
conversations,
any
and
all
conversations
in
room
801
at
15
east
48th
street.
it
also
was
a
private
office
location.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
second
one
was
not,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
second
one
was
the
office
of
a
man
named
harry
steinman,
who
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
in
which
the
eavesdropping
was
conducted
under
the
first
warrant
is
purported
that
to
be
a
person
who
was
to
pay
$30,000.00
for
a
liquor
license.
he
is
described
as
a
liquor
license
applicant.
he
is
later
named
in
the
indictment
itself
as
a
co-defendant.
at
issue
then
firstly
in
this
case
is
whether
the
new
york
ex
parte
judicial
permissive
eavesdrop
statute
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
very
interesting.
it
was
disclosed
at
the
trial
that
a
police
officer
described
as
a
wireman,
surreptitiously
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning,
placed
these
instrumentalities,
the
microphone
which
we
call
the
bug,
in
the
private
offices,
in
which
they
were
located
and
in
at
least
one
instance
the
policeman
made
a
return
visit
to
the
premises.
it's
my
recollection
to
how
it
occurred
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well
we
weren't
permitted
to
show
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
attempted
to
show
that
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
it
was
certainly
not
under
the
authority
of
the
tenant
of
the
building.
it
may
have
been
and
i
have
no
knowledge
with
respect
to
this,
possibly
with
the
consent
of
the
owner
of
the
building,
but
certainly
not
with
the
consent
of
the
tenant
of
each
--
of
either
of
the
premises
which
were
both
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
oh,
clearly,
clearly.
it's
conceded
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
so
far
as
the
tenants
were
concerned
and
with
respect
to
the
particular
premises
in
which
the
microphones
were
concealed.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
only
authority
before
the
entry
was
in
fact
the
orders.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
they
say
[attempt
to
laughter]
to
do
anything
that
you
wanted
to
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
do
anything
at
all
to
get
in
and
just
as
long
as
you
get
in
there
and
overhear
any
and
all
conversations
that
may
take
place.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
oh,
no.
mr.
justice
harlan,
nothing
at
all
like
a
search
warrant
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
certainly
not
mr.
justice
clark
and
nobody
had
any
idea
that
this
surreptitious
activity
was
being
conducted
with
this
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
could
operate
secretly
for
24
hours
a
day
for
a
period
of
60
days
and
then
be
renewed
for
a
like
period.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
douglas.
that
was
the
expiration
date
authorized
by
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
connection
with
a
--
the
--
what
we
understand
to
be
ordinary
search
warrant,
i
believe
there
is
such
requirement
in
law.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
does
not
apply
to
the
circumstances
in
this
case
or
to
the
statute
itself
in
this
case
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
this
particular
case,
it
did
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
this
was
the
picking
up,
the
overhearing
of
all
conversations
in
the
private
offices
concerned
transmitted
through
the
unused
telephone
wires
to
the
listening
post
in
another
location.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
we
were
only
able
and
permitted
to
ascertain
that
it
was
in
another
room
--
it
was
in
a
room
in
another
building
but
the
trial
court
did
not
permit
us
as
i
recall
the
record
to
inquire
us
to
the
location
of
that
other
building.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes
sir.
we
then
present
to
this
court
two
issues.
firstly,
whether
the
new
york
ex
parte
judicial
permissive
eavesdrop
statute
may
constitutionally
authorize
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
as
our
amicus
civil
liberties
union
urges
under
the
first
amendment,
a
trespassory
intrusion
by
electronic
bugging
in
private
premises
to
make
a
general
search
for
evidence
to
support
a
criminal
prosecution.
secondly,
on
the
assumption
that
the
fourth
amendment
constitutionality
of
that
statute
is
satisfied,
where
the
ex
parte
orders
for
those
room
eavesdrops
based
on
an
adequate
showing
of
probable
cause.
it
appears
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
this
court
is
called
upon
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
otherwise
unconstitution
--
constitutional
trespassory
room
bugging
can
be
made
constitutional
by
an
advanced
ex
parte
judicial
order
and
whether
a
state
statute
setting
up
such
a
system
is
constitutional.
the
recent
osborn
decision
does
not
reach
this
issue
and
i
shall
refer
to
osborn
in
my
discussion.
it
is
true
that
in
osborn,
a
form
of
electronic
monitoring
was
approved
on
the
basis
of
advanced
judicial
permission
and
it
is
true
that
in
osborn,
several
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
joined
in
the
decision
apparently
because
this
judicial
permission
was
deemed
to
remove
the
constitutional
objections
under
the
particular
facts
in
that
case.
in
the
first
place,
osborn
involved
a
“minifon”
device
and
not
a
surreptitious
intrusion.
the
“minifon”
problem
has
always
until
now
been
regarded
by
this
court
differently
from
the
trespassory
room
bug.
minifon
type
activity
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
on
lee
and
lopez
cases.
trespassory
room
bugging
has
been
disapproved
since
the
silverman
decision.
it
cannot
be
argued
from
this
that
the
factor
of
advanced
judicial
permission
in
the
osborn
“minifon”
situation
where
the
justices
who
had
dissented
or
otherwise
differed
from
the
majority
in
on
lee
and
lopez
joined
in
the
osborn
majority.
it
cannot
be
argued
from
this
that
osborn
has
settled
for
all
purposes
and
for
all
types
of
electronic
monitoring,
the
problem
of
advanced
judicial
permission
as
a
cure
or
otherwise
unconstitutional
electronic
eavesdropping.
aside
from
the
distinction
between
a
“minifon”
device
and
a
room
bug
in
private
premises,
osborn
is
distinguishable
from
our
case
on
several
other
grounds.
and
osborn
fails
to
solve
the
entire
problem
of
advanced
judicial
permission
for
several
other
reasons.
we
have
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
brief
at
pages
58
--
55
to
58,
the
several
distinguishing
points
affecting
osborn.
above
all,
there
is
the
matter
of
specifically
limiting
the
monitoring
--
the
electronic
monitoring
which
it
was
possible
to
do
in
osborn
where
they
were
aiming
at
a
specific
scheduled
conversation
to
be
held
at
a
specific
time.
but
how
can
this
be
remotely
compared
to
a
60-day
general
room
bugging
order
to
overhear
all
conversations
in
a
private
place?
whatever
principles
or
standards
maybe
derived
from
the
forms
of
the
judicial
permission
which
was
approved
in
osborn,
those
principles
and
standards
cannot
possibly
be
satisfied
by
813
(a)
of
the
new
york
statute
and
they
have
not
been
satisfied
in
this
case.
since
osborn
then
does
not
reach
the
question
of
advanced
judicial
permission
for
trespassory
bugging,
we
must
in
this
case
explore
an
uncharted
sea,
that
is,
we
have
no
guidance
from
any
decision
of
this
court
with
the
exception
that
i
will
mention
to
help
determine
what
kind
of
judicial
permission
for
trespassory
bugging
might
be
constitutionally
acceptable
or
indeed
where
there
any
kind
of
judicial
permission
can
constitutionally
be
devised
for
trespassory
bugging.
i
just
mentioned
that
some
guidance
has
been
offered
in
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
i
was
referring
to
the
discussion
of
mr.
justice
lopez
--
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
lopez
case,
but
the
point
was
not
pursued
to
conclusion
in
that
discussion.
it
was
expressly
left
for
a
later
day.
this
case
brings
us
to
that
day.
the
immediate
question
in
this
case
is
whether
new
york
state
found
a
constitutional
solution
for
the
problem
of
judicial
permission?
may
i
read
excerpts
from
the
new
york
statute?
an
ex
parte
order
for
eavesdropping
maybe
issued
by
any
justice
of
the
supreme
court
upon
oath
or
affirmation
of
a
district
attorney,
or
of
the
attorney
general,
or
an
officer
above
the
rank
of
sergeant
of
any
police
department
of
the
state,
or
of
any
political
subdivision
thereof,
that
there
is
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
evidence
of
crime
maybe
thus
obtained,
and
particularly
describing
the
person
or
persons
whose
communications,
conversations,
or
discussions
are
to
be
overheard
or
recorded
and
the
purpose
thereof.
any
such
order
together
with
the
papers
upon
which
the
application
was
based,
shall
be
delivered
to
and
retained
by
the
applicant
as
authority
for
the
eavesdropping
authorized
therein.
a
true
copy
of
such
order
shall
at
all
times
be
retained
in
his
possession
by
the
judge
or
justice
issuing
the
same.
as
applied
in
this
case
through
the
eavesdrop
orders
that
were
issued,
the
statute
as
i've
already
indicated
was
given
its
maximum
scope.
the
eavesdropping
was
permitted
for
60
days
and
then
for
renewed
periods
of
60
days.
it
was
permitted
on
an
outright
trespassory
basis
in
private
room
premises.
it
was
permitted
to
be
done
as
a
deliberate,
unrestricted
search
for
evidence
of
any
crime,
and
while
i
pass
for
the
moment
full
details
as
to
probable
cause,
i
note
here
that
the
warrants
used
for
electronic
search
were
wholly
unlimited
in
the
sense
that
they
bore
no
relation
to
the
alleged
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
there
is
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
not
embraced
within
this
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
the
proceedings
on
the
motion
to
renew
mr.
justice
fortas,
all
of
the
reels
of
tape
which
were
taken
at
the
listening
posts,
were
produced
in
court
marked
as
exhibits
and
in
a
dry
run
before
the
court
at
which
time
they
were
present,
actually
attempting
to
record
what
was
being
reproduced,
three
certified
court
reporters,
who
attempted
to
make
transcripts
of
that
which
was
being
reproduced.
as
a
result
of
the
dry
run
before
the
trial
court
except
for
one
reel
which
became
exhibit
61
(a)
in
the
trial,
all
of
the
others
were
excluded
on
various
grounds
suggested
and
stated
by
the
trial
judge.
primarily,
they
were
held
to
be
a
material,
irrelevant,
no
probative
value,
and
they
were
also
inaudible
and
impossible
to
understand.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
was
an
attempted
recording
of
everything
that
was
said
by
anybody
who
was
in
either
of
the
bugged
premises.
that
was
what
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
total
number
of
prosecutions.
there
have
been
several
and
on
several
grounds.
i
understand
that
there
have
been
some
perjury
indictments.
i
understand
that
there
have
been
other
indictments.
there
was
at
least
one
other
indictment
charging
a
conspiracy
to
bribe
perhaps
to
conspiracy
to
bribe
officials
of
the
new
york
state
liquor
authority.
and
i
am
not
entirely
clear
as
to
the
details
with
respect
to
the
bugging
or
the
wiretapping
in
each
of
those
cases,
but
i
am
satisfied,
for
example
that,
there
is
presently
pending
an
indictment
in
new
york
involving
the
attorney
harry
neyer,
whose
premises
were
a
bugged
under
the
april
12,
1962
order
on
the
basis
of
which
it
is
said
that
there
was
a
development
in
which
he
in
a
telephone
conversation
with
a
petitioner
in
this
case
led
to
further
activities.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
that
--
it
does
in
fact
create
problems
because
under
the
statute,
a
copy
of
the
order
is
given
to
the
eavesdropper
and
a
copy
of
the
order
at
all
times
is
retained
in
his
possession
by
the
issuing
judge.
there
is
no
central
place
in
which
it
is
filed
and
there's
no
disclosure
with
respect
to
with
having
them
made
or
having
them
filed
unless
and
until
usually
by
accident
it
comes
to
light
or
by
reason
of
the
constant
probing
and
the
questions
that
are
put
by
diligent
counsel,
it
becomes
developed
and
then
only
can
the
proceedings
be
developed
in
respect
of
them.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
ex
parte
orders
mr.
chief
justice
are
entirely
secret
and
are
not
made
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
until
such
time
as
there's
had
a
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
such
emotion
as
the
motions
which
i
made,
a
motion
which
i
made
in
this
case.
the
district
attorney
in
responding
to
the
motion
makes
his
argument
and
proof
maybe
taken.
in
this
case,
the
necessity
for
taking
proof
was
obviated
because
of
the
stipulation
which
was
entered
into
between
the
district
attorney
and
myself
in
which
it
was
agreed
that
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
leads
came
from
the
trespassory
bugging
in
these
private
offices
and
without
that
evidence
and
without
those
leads,
there
would
be
no
case
on
which
the
prosecution
could
have
gone
forward.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
couldn't
possibly
be
better
characterized,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
what
ostensibly
started
as
a
--
as
probable
cause
in
regard
to
liquor
license
corruption
culminated
in
electronic
search
warrants
not
limited
to
any
specific
crime
or
to
any
named
person,
or
to
any
time
except
as
i
said
before
for
the
expiration
date
allowed
by
the
statute,
namely
60
days.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
am
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
will.
i
will
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
there
is
ever
going
to
be
a
statutory
system
of
curing
unconstitutional
electronic
eavesdropping
through
the
cure
of
advanced
judicial
permission
and
anyone
believes
it
will
be
this
statute
or
one
like
it.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
brief
that
no
system
of
judicial
permission
can
be
constitutionally
devised
for
this
area
except
perhaps
and
i
emphasized
perhaps
for
the
case
of
supreme
public
emergency
and
then
only
for
security
and
not
for
prosecutorial
purposes.
in
order
for
this
particular
case
to
be
reversed
by
this
court,
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
court
agree
with
this
in
this
broad
policy
position
suggested
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
that
useful
lines
of
analysis
are
opened
up
in
our
suggestion
which
can
be
helpful
in
deciding
this
case.
for
example,
should
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
be
subject
to
judicially
permitted
electronic
intrusion
without
limit
as
to
what
kind
of
crime
the
police
eavesdropper
is
seeking?
the
new
york
statute
is
unlimited
in
this
respect.
for
example
also,
should
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
be
subjected
to
judicially
permitted
intrusion
without
even
defining
at
all
in
the
judicial
warrant,
what
private
conversations
criminal
or
non-criminal
maybe
be
searched?
is
that
the
way
it
was
done
in
osborn?
the
new
york
statute,
however,
permits
such
search
and
indeed,
it
makes
it
inevitable.
it
seems
to
us
indisputable
that
this
particular
statute
goes
too
far
by
any
rational
standard
of
our
privacy
traditions
under
the
constitution.
the
argument
on
this
point
could
end
here
without
going
on
to
ask,
what
kind
of
a
better
statute
might
satisfy
the
constitution?
we
take
it
that
the
court
maybe
interested
in
having
us
explore
the
question
in
its
broader
extensions
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
included
in
our
brief
a
discussion
of
the
broader
policy
implications
of
judicially
permitted
electronic
eavesdropping.
and
the
conclusion
which
we
have
proposed
is
again
that
no
system
of
judicial
permission
can
satisfy
the
constitution
for
any
case
of
electronic
search
where
the
purpose
is
criminal
prosecution.
i've
asked
myself
whether
some
position
short
of
this
perhaps
could
be
worked
out
to
allow
judicially
permitted
electronic
eavesdropping
for
criminal
prosecutions
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
constitutionally,
logical
or
palatable
answer
short
of
outright
ban.
one
reason,
why
we
have
believe
that
necessary
to
formulate
our
position
is
the
advent
of
the
age
of
the
parabolic
microphone
and
no
one
knows
what
has
yet
to
come?
i
have
not
yet
touched
on
the
subject
of
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination.
the
court
is
frequently
spoken
of
the
interplay
feature
as
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
the
indiscriminate
character
of
electronic
room
bugging
and
the
warrants
in
this
case,
make
it
inevitable
that
fifth
amendment
rights
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment
rights
are
immediately
threatened.
the
rights
are
threatened
both
through
the
general
search
that
is
intrinsically
involved
in
any
such
indiscriminate
room
bugging
and
they
are
threatened
even
more
acutely
in
this
case
by
the
search
for
mere
evidence.
in
fact,
the
search
for
mere
evidence
is
the
expressly
declared
purpose
under
the
new
york
statute
and
under
the
warrants
issued
in
this
case.
i
come
now
to
our
second
point,
that
is,
assuming
the
federal
constitutionality
of
section
813,
we
asked
whether
the
ex
parte
eavesdropping
orders
authorizing
the
intrusion
nevertheless
are
invalid
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
were
not
based
upon
an
adequate
showing
of
probable
clause.
these
ex
parte
orders
here
were
secured
on
application
to
a
judge
under
the
provision
of
that
statute
813
(a).
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
they
are,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
applications
in
support
of
the
first
order
made
on
attorney
neyer's
offices,
with
respect
to
attorney
neyer's
offices
appear
at
681
to
683
inclusive
of
the
record
and
the
applications
in
support
of
the
second
eavesdrop
order
on
the
premises
of
steinman
appear
at
pages
685
to
687
inclusive
of
the
record.
we
take
the
position
that
the
record
of
the
proceedings
on
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress
before
the
trial
judge,
fails
to
establish
that
any
sworn
testimony
or
evidence
was
adduced
before
him
indicating
that
any
showing
or
presentation
was
made
to
the
issuing
judge
beyond
the
affidavits
recited
in
the
orders
as
the
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
neyer
and
steinman
eavesdropping.
the
validity
of
the
orders
then
must
stand
on
the
record
made
before
the
issuing
judge.
and
as
your
honors
can
see
that
record
in
the
case
of
each
order
consisted
only
of
the
affidavits
of
two
assistant
district
attorneys
in
the
application
for
and
in
each
instance
the
order
itself.
the
affidavits,
primarily
the
affidavit
made
by
mr.
mccanna
which
is
adopted
by
reference,
by
mr.
scotti,
in
the
neyer's
eavesdrop,
rarely
--
merely
recite
in
conclusory
fashion
that
the
affiance
have
“information”
and
“evidence”
that
a
conspiracy
exists
to
force
persons
seeking
to
obtain
or
retain
liquor
licenses
to
pay
large
sums
of
money
for
them.
and
that
harry
neyer,
an
attorney,
must
be
engaged
to
carry
the
bribe
or
extortion
money
to
the
state
liquor
authority
official.
no
facts
are
set
forth
concerning
what
information
or
evidence
is
alleged
to
be
in
the
prosecutor's
possession,
or
the
source
of
that
information
or
evidence,
or
the
reliability
of
the
source.
the
order
itself
asserts
that
it
was
made
on
the
affidavits
of
the
two
assistant
district
attorneys
and
makes
no
reference
to
“minifons”
or
any
other
information
or
evidence.
in
the
application
in
support
of
the
second
steinman
eavesdrop
order
except
for
references
to
the
earlier
neyer
eavesdrop,
and
that
from
it
evidence
was
obtained
indicating
that
steinman
had
agreed
to
pay
$30,000.00
to
neyer
to
secure
a
liquor
license,
that
court
was
informed
of
no
more
than
it
was
on
the
neyer
application.
here
again,
no
facts
are
set
forth
in
the
affidavits
identifying
the
persons
from
whom
the
evidence
was
obtained
or
the
reliability
of
such
persons,
or
any
reasons
for
crediting
them.
the
steinman
order
itself
recites
as
does
the
neyer
order
that
it
was
made
on
the
affidavits
of
two
assistant
district
attorneys.
it
likewise
makes
no
reference
to
“minifons”
or
any
other
information
or
evidence.
it
is
apparent
then
that
except
for
a
reference
to
a
prior
eavesdrop
of
attorney
neyer's
office
and
an
innocuous
statement
that
steinman
was
a
prospective
license
applicant
required
to
pay
$30,000.00,
the
allegations
in
support
of
a
steinman
order
are
sheer
unsupported
conclusions
based
on
general
claims
of
information
or
evidence
in
the
prosecutor's
possession.
in
short,
the
affidavits
on
both
applications
furnish
nothing
upon
which
the
magistrate
could
make
an
informed,
and
deliberate
determination
as
required
by
this
court
in
aguilar
v.
texas.
contrast
these
inadequate
affidavits
with
a
meticulous
showing
required
to
be
made
and
in
fact
made
to
the
district
judges
in
osborn,
the
federal
fourth
amendment
decisions
preclude
the
giving
of
any
weight
to
any
after
thought
suggestion
that
the
respondent
could
have
justified
both
eavesdrops
on
the
basis
of
prior
“minifon”
recordings.
indeed,
the
record
keeping
requirements
of
813
(a)
negate
any
possible
intention
by
the
new
york
legislature
that
eavesdropping
when
subjected
to
later
court
review
should
be
sustainable
on
the
basis
of
anything
beyond
what
the
formal
record
itself
states.
i
ask
this
court
to
note
that
the
references
to
prior
“minifons”
and
other
information
now
suggested
as
a
basis
for
probable
cause
was
mentioned
for
the
first
time
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress
before
the
trial
court.
finally
in
view
of
osborn
one
may
ask,
“where
are
the
judicial
permissive
orders
for
the
“minifon”
surveillance
which
the
prosecutor
claims
were
antecedent
to
and
supported
the
application
for
the
room
bugging
orders
in
this
case.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
footnote
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
would
say
mr.
justice
black
that
no
plain
everyday
ordinary
eavesdropping
would
be
permitted
to
be
conducted
under
an
order
for
which
an
application
was
made
to
a
judge
where
the
search
would
be
an
indiscriminate
one
from
mere
evidence
without
regard
to
whose
conversations
were
being
overheard,
without
regard
to
what
crime
if
any
was
being
committed
or
had
been
committed,
i
believe
that
such
an
application
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation
mr.
justice
black,
but
that
would
not
be
our
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
well,
i
feel
that
it
does.
this
court,
however,
in
osborn
felt
that
that
was
proper
under
the
particular
circumstances
in
that
unique
case
which
may
never
again
be
repeated.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
don't
think
that
in
either
instance
there
would
be
a
difference.
i
think
that
in
either
case
such
an
order
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
this
relates
to
eavesdropping
and
i
believe
it
could
issue
under
this
act.
the
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
none
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no,
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
the
statute
is
constitutionally
intolerable
because
it
permits
indiscriminately
any
kind
of
general
search
as
the
statute
authorizes.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
trespassory
invasion
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
it
would,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
under
such
a
warrant
as
we
have
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
would
say
that
that
too
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable.
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
type
of
situation
which
you
suggest
mr.
justice
white
and
the
situation
which
was
suggested
in
osborn.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
in
that
situation
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
if
he
went
to
mr.
neyer's
office,
there
might
be
a
trespass.
if
he
conducted
these
conversations
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
there
would
not
in
his
own
office,
mr.
chief
justice,
no.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
i
would
--
i
do
call
that
constitutionally
intolerable
and
i'm
aware
that
--
i'm
aware
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
court
and
myself
in
that
regard.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
true,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
the
distinction
which
i
made
mr.
justice
white
was
that
if
he
had
the
microphone,
the
concealed
microphone
in
his
own
office,
the
element
of
trespass
would
not
be
involved.
if
on
the
other
hand
he
went
to
mr.
neyer's
office,
secretly
cloaked
with
the
microphone,
the
“minifon”
or
whatever
device
he
maybe
using,
i
think
a
trespass
might
be
involved.
in
short,
as
i
indicated
to
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
yes,
sir
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
would
as
i
say
i'm
aware
of
the
difference
between
the
court
and
myself
on
that
regard.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
footnote
75
found
at
page
44
of
the
brief
of
respondent's
amici,
the
attorney
generals
of
massachusetts
and
oregon
and
the
national
district
attorney's
association
in
which
there
is
made
the
tacit
admission
that
the
warrants
in
this
case
were
issued
without
an
adequate
showing
of
probable
cause.
may
i
reserve
10
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
say
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
eavesdropping
orders
become
a
part
of
the
record.
in
my
own
experience
as
both
a
federal
and
state
prosecutor,
i
know
of
no
cases
in
which
notification
of
a
matter
similar
to
this
kind
of
situation
is
given
in
advance
by
the
prosecutor
to
his
adversary
representing
a
defendant
or
a
proposed
defendant.
and
i
am
ready
to
say
and
do
say
now
to
this
court
that
i
know
of
no
case
under
which
an
eavesdropping
order
was
obtained
in
new
york
county
in
which
prior
to
the
trial,
the
district
attorney
advised
defense
counsel
of
the
existence
of
such
order
and
of
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
it
leads
and
evidence
were
obtained.
and
i
say
unqualifiedly
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
by
making
a
motion
to
suppress,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
exactly
so.
we
took
the
initiative.
we
found
by
examining
the
record
in
another
case
that
there
had
been
a
bugging
order
and
evidence
obtained
in
that
case.
that
was
a
case
involving
a
judge
of
the
state
court
of
claims.
in
the
course
of
that
case,
his
counsel,
made
a
motion
and
demanded
a
hearing
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
bugging
order.
it
was
developed
in
the
course
of
that
case
and
from
the
transcript
of
that
case
i
learned
that
in
fact
that
in
that
case
there
had
been
an
eavesdropping
order.
consequently,
i
made
a
motion
on
the
assumption
that
if
there
had
been
in
that
case,
there
might
will
be
one
in
my
case
and
i
discovered
as
a
result
of
making
that
motion
that
there
had
in
fact
been
such
orders
as
we
have
described
here
and
which
are
the
warrants
in
this
case,
which
are
anything
but
from
a
reading
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
regret
to
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
prosecution
gave
me,
no
information
beyond
what
i
already
had
and
they
didn't
give
me
that.
unfortunately,
mr.
uviller,
who
had
no
familiarity
with
the
matter
at
that
posture
of
the
case,
was
not
able
to
furnish
the
court
with
any
of
the
factual
matter
concerning
it.
the
prosecution
gave
us
no
information
at
all.
they
opposed
the
motion
to
suppress
as
the
matter
of
fact.
the
judge
in
the
--
what
is
comfortable
to
special
termed
who
heard
the
motion
denied
it
with
leave
to
renew.
it
was
only
on
the
renewal
that
we
got
any
indication
at
all
of
the
fact
that
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no.
the
prosecution
didn't
voluntarily
do
anything.
if
we
had
not
renewed
the
motion
to
suppress,
if
we
have
waived
it,
if
we
had
gone
ahead
with
the
trial,
we
would
have
heard
nothing
about
it
until
that
posture
in
the
case
when
the
evidence
is
being
offered
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
preliminary
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
--
is
the
preliminary
in
connection
with
the
proceedings
that
were
to
be
held
on
the
renewal
of
the
motion
to
suppress
and
that
is
the
area,
and
to
which
mr.
uviller
refers
when
he
says
the
record
is
cloudy
as
to
what
was
before
the
issuing
judge
at
the
time
the
warrants
were
issued.
it
was
in
the
course
of
the
statement
made
by
the
prosecutor
then
in
connection
with
the
renewed
motion
to
suppress
that
he
told
the
court
that
as
the
genesis
for
these
orders,
there
had
been
a
prior
minifon
surveillance
for
which
incidentally
there
was
no
permissive
judicial
order.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
what
mckenzie
said
at
that
time
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
came
after
i
renewed
the
motion
to
suppress
as
i
had
leave
to
do
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court
which
denied
my
motion
originally.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
that
the
respondents'
brief
reflects
the
number
of
eavesdropping
orders
which
it
obtained
over
period
of
some
six
years.
it
does
not
give
any
indication
of
the
number
of
eavesdrops
which
have
been
carried
on
without
orders.
i
think
that
they
say
they
have
an
average
of
22
orders
per
year
for
the
period
of
six
years
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
would
have
to
come
internally
from
the
prosecutor's
office.
there
are
not
publicly
available
except
as
they
may
have
been
presented
to
a
joint
legislative
committee
investigating
a
whole
subject
of
electronic
intrusions.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
there
in
the
respondents'
brief
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
i
think
they
are
at
page
61
mr.
uviller
advices
me.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no,
i
--
we
point
out
of
course
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
say
that
they
cannot
be
a
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
argue
that
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
requirement
--
with
the
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause
under
that
amendment.
now,
the
situation
does
not
permit
itself
to
come
within
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brill
no.
we're
saying
that
even
if
there
were
service,
let
me
withdraw
that
mr.
brennan.
if
there
were
service
of
notice
in
advance
following
the
judicial
permissive
order
as
the
respondent
has
pointed
out,
there
would
be
no
eavesdropping.
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it
cannot
be
separated
that
way
based
upon
the
issue
of
notice
along.
now,
we
--
i
think
that
the
situation
is
aggravated
because
there
can
be
no
notice
because
it
is
surreptitious
and
consequently,
there
can
be
no
knowledge
and
there
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
wanted
in
passing
to
make
a
comment
on
this
issue
of
standing.
the
stipulation
which
was
obtained
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
before
the
trial
court
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
integrated
both
warrants
and
the
proceedings
had
in
connection
with
both
warrants.
there
was
no
separation.
it
was
not
until
after
the
appellate
procedures
were
instituted
that
the
suggestions
was
made
that
the
two
were
separated
and
to
suggest
and
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
standing
with
respect
to
one
but
no
standing
with
the
respect
to
the
order
upon
the
basis
of
which
the
second
order
was
obtained
is
to
request
the
license,
to
permit
the
kind
of
fraudulent
activity
which
police
officers
might
be
capable
of
committing
in
order
to
get
to
the
second
order.
and
i
do
believe
sincerely
that
we
have
the
right
to
attack
the
first
order
and
that
issue
was
before
this
court
on
the
application
for
certiorari.
respondent
raised
the
issue
and
we
interpose
the
reply
brief
in
which
we
discuss
the
matter
in
considerable
detail.
now
the
other
matters
to
which
i
wanted
to
advert
in
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice
are
that
covered
by
our
brief
and
i
will
not
impinge
further
upon
the
time
of
this
court.
thank
you.
