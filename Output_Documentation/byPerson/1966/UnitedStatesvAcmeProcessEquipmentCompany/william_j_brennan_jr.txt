mr.
solicitor
general,
does
it
appear
that
the
principles,
would
you
say,
they
were
epstein's,
some
of
it?
did
they
know
anything
about
these
kickback
arrangements
of
tucker's,
or
does
that
appear
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
well,
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
they
being
epstein
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
like
who
had
what
commission
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
what,
commission
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
they
did
not
know,
you
say,
or
at
least
it
doesn't
appear
that
they
knew
that
tucker
and
--
what's
the
other
fellow's
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
norris
were
getting
kickbacks
from
the
subcontractors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it,
they
know
at
any
time
during
the
contract
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
i'm
asking
him
--
as
--
i
was
going
to
ask
what
--
what's
the
predicate
of
the
government's
position?
that
merely
because
norris
and
tucker,
officials
of
acme,
assume
now,
without
the
knowledge
of
epstein
and
the
other
principals
were
taking
kickbacks;
that
this
in
and
of
itself
would
be
enough
to
justify
cancellation
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
what
i
want
to
get
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we
should
weigh
the
merit
of
the
government's
position
on
the
premise
that
even
if
epstein
and
the
other
principals
of
acme
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it,
nevertheless
the
government's
entitled
to
cancel
the
contract
if
indeed
at
the
time
the
contract
with
the
government
was
made,
tucker
and
norris
had
these
kickback
contracts
or
subcontracts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you're
going
to
develop
why
that
should
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
at
least,
i
gather,
from
what
you've
just
said
that
you're
suggesting
that
the
--
this
right
of
cancellation
that
the
government
asserts
doesn't
arise
at
least
until
the
principals
learn
of
something
which
they
should
look
into,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
trying
to
find
--
how
far
are
you
carrying
a
principal.
for
example,
let's
take
what
i
suppose
might
be
a
rather
usual
situation,
that
is,
if
a
large
government
contract
that
negotiates
contract
with
the
government
has
a
subcontracting
officer
unknown
to
any
principal
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
contractor,
any
director,
any
officer,
this
contracting
officer
has
a
kickback
arrangements
with
some
of
the
subcontractors
and
indeed
he
places
the
subcontracts
only
with
those
who
will
give
him
kickbacks.
now,
the
--
this
doesn't
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
--
any
responsible
officer
or
the
contractor
so
long
after
the
contract
is
being
performed,
and
they
do
nothing
when
they
learn
about
it,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
they
did
nothing
then,
their
failure
to
do
anything
would
justify
the
government
exercising
its
right
of
cancellation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they've
never
learned
anything
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
should've
learned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
--
the
subcontracting
officer
gets
away
with
it,
nobody
ever
finds
out
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
there's
still
have
to
be
something
performed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
point
would
be
i
gather
that
no
matter
how
well
the
contract
was
being
performed
to
everybody's
satisfaction,
once
the
principals
of
the
contract
have
learned
of
this
kickback
operation
of
their
subcontracting
officer
and
did
nothing
about
it,
you'd
be
in
the
position
to
cancel
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
i
say,
i
don't
know
why
you're
suggesting
you'd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
forgetting
that,
i'm
trying
to
get,
your
position
is
so
the
government
in
that
situation
should
have
the
right
to
cancel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
would
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
if
you
had
no
right
to
cancel
it,
does
the
government
concede
that
it
ought
to
pay
acme?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
on
the
theory
that
if
they
would
have
been
allowed
to
finish
the
contract,
they
could've
cut
their
losses
down.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
this
and
--
if
you
had
no
right
to
cancel,
the
best
--
rest
could
be
--
would
be
what,
termination
for
the
convenience
of
the
government,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
violation
of
the
contingent
fee
covenant?
was
that
--
and
tucker
and
the
other
fellow's
arrangement
was
acme
to
get
business
for
acme?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that's
what
the
violation
was
which
the
court
of
claims
said
having
done
nothing
about
it
over
14
months,
the
government
can't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
rely
on
it
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
kickback
arrangements
for
subcontractors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
the
government's
position
were
sustained
by
us,
i
gather
the
government
will
have
to
pay
you
a
nickel,
would
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
--
don't
try
to
--
looking
for
it,
just
what
was
the
substance
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically,
of
what
kickbacks,
tucker
and
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
three
months
before
the
cancellation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
in
that
connection,
as
in
the
matter
of
eligibility
for
future
contract,
had
there
been
a
cancellation
for
the
convenience
of
the
government,
well,
i
guess,
the
no
question
acme's
eligibility
to
bid
on
future
contract.
but
the
form
of
cancellation
that
was
made
was
statutory
violations
does
that
have
consequences
as
to
eligibility
for
future
contracts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
still
to
be
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
may
be
shaved
down,
we
don't
know
how
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
don't
know
that
they
make
money
until
after
this
adjustment
on
the
excessive
cost,
do
you?
has
it
