mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
just
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
briefly,
did
you
or
were
you
indicating
earlier
that
there
is
a
footnote
in
your
brief
relating
to
what
the
situation
would
be
if
neither
statute
were
applicable?
justice
abe
fortas
if
there
is,
would
you
kindly
let
me
know
later
where
that
is.
you
let
me
know
later.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
one
of
the
men
involved
in
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
one
of
the
men
involved
in
the
kickback
arrangement
was
an
--
at
least
one
of
them,
was
an
employee,
that
is,
jack
epstein.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
--
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
an
officer
in
a
technical
sense.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
was
a
full
time
employee
of
the
company.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
head
of
a
plant,
not
the
plant
in
which
this
work
was
done
but
in
another
plant,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
his
father,
joshua
epstein,
who
was
the
president
of
the
company.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
we
have
here,
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
minimum
is
two
men,
tucker
and
norris
who
were
--
might
be
considered
as
the
independent
contractors,
in
a
sense
that
they
were
compensated
on
a
fee
basis.
jack
epstein,
who
was
an
important
employee
of
the
company
and
he
was
on
its
payroll,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
your
--
i
suppose
your
position
at
this
point
is
that
the
anti-kickback
statute
had
no
criminal
provision,
in
other
words
just
a
civil
provision,
just
had
a
civil
remedy
recovery
of
the
amount
involved
that
there
is
no
principle
of
law
which
would
enable
the
government
also
to
invoke
the
remedy
of
cancellation.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
government
in
about
midway
through
the
performance
of
the
contract,
should've
find
out
that
kickbacks
are
taking
place
as
it
did
in
this
instance.
you're
saying
so
to
me,
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
then
could
not
lawfully
cancel
the
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
they
didn't
have
to
go
ahead
and
let
the
fellow
perform
the
contract
and
pay
the
fellow
under
the
contract
even
though
the
situation
were
ripe
with
kickbacks.
justice
abe
fortas
i
say,
it'd
be
kind
of
an
uncomfortable
situation
now.
