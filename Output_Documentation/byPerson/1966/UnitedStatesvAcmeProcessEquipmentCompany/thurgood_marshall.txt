mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
review
of
the
decision
and
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
cancel
the
contract
with
acme
process
equipment
company
for
the
violation
of
the
anti-kickback
statute
committed
allegedly
by
key
officials
of
that
company.
in
addition
to
court
of
claims,
disagreeing
with
its
trial
commissioner
in
contrary
we
say
to
the
traditional
measure
of
damages
permitted
acme
restitutional
relief,
that
is,
it
measured
acme's
damages
by
the
costs
the
company
had
expanded
thus
putting
acme
in
the
position
it
occupied
before
the
contract
was
made.
that
measure
resulted,
we
will
contend
in
an
unjustified
windfall
to
acme
since
ordinary
damages
would
have
been
compensated
for
the
loss
caused
by
the
breach.
on
this
hearing,
we
alleged
two
points.
the
first
issue,
the
first
question
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
government
is
entitled
in
the
case
of
this
type
to
cancel
a
contract
because
responsible
officials
of
the
prime
contractor
have
accepted
kickbacks
from
some
contractors
in
violation
of
the
specific
statute
prohibiting
such
kickbacks.
and
the
second
question
is
that
if
the
government
was
not
justified
in
canceling
the
contract
from
statutory
violations,
then
an
additional
issue
is
presented
as
to
the
proper
measure
of
damages
for
the
alleged
breach
of
contract.
the
salient
facts
surrounding
the
kickbacks
are
as
follows:
acme
was
a
company
owned
by
joshua
epstein,
samuel
fisher,
their
children
and
other
close
relatives.
they
manufactured
boilers
and
other
items
of
the
likes
--
type
of
machinery.
in
1952,
it
became
interested
in
diversifying.
and
in
october
of
that
year,
it
hired
james
s.
norris
and
harry
j.
tucker,
jr.
who
represented
themselves
as
experts
in
obtaining
and
administering
government
procurement
contracts.
indeed,
ensure
--
norris
was
proposed
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
would
become
the
general
manager
for
production
and
tucker
was
placed
in
charge
of
sales
and
government
contracts
and
have
proposed
new
addition
to
the
acme
firm
in
a
plant
yet
to
be
leased.
tucker
had
already
made
arrangements
with
several
companies
under
which
he
was
to
receive
kickbacks
on
sales
by
the
companies
to
customers
procured
by
him
and
these
would
include
of
course
acme.
indeed,
tucker
agreed
to
share
these
kickbacks
to
norris.
one
of
these
companies
develops
as
all
metals
industries
which
would
become
the
principal
subcontractor.
tucker
heard
that
the
army
ordinates
corps
in
philadelphia
was
the
contractor,
the
manufacturer
of
recoilless
rifles,
seventy
five
millimeter
rifles;
and
acting
on
tucker's
advice
that
a
bid
of
$350
per
rifle
would
probably
insure
an
award
of
contract,
acme
submitted
a
bid
of
$337.23
per
rifle.
acme's
bid
was
signed
by
norris.
sometime
between
the
date
of
the
bid
and
the
award
of
the
contracts
three
months
later,
the
army
ordinates
corps
advised
acme
that
it
was
--
it
might
have
been
a
mistake
for
them
to
have
hired
tucker
because
tucker's
father
was
suspected
of
kickback
activities.
but
joshua
epstein,
the
president
of
acme,
ignored
this
advice
and
made
no
effort
to
investigate
tucker
despite
the
fact
that
tucker's
contract
with
acme
included
a
provision
that
he
represent
and
will
continue
to
represent
firms
in
other
lines
of
business.
one
point
i
should
mention
on
the
rifles,
the
bid
of
three
$337.23
was
far
below
any
other
bid.
for
example,
the
two
other
bids
were
$484
and
$930
respectively.
and
the
two
final
bids
were
four
hundred
twenty
three
and
six
hundred
and
eighty
four.
but
acme
put
in
a
bid
of
three
hundred
thirty
seven
and
twenty-three
cents.
on
january
1953,
the
contractor
for
the
manufacturing
of
2751
recoilless
rifles
was
awarded
to
acme
as
the
low
bidder.
but
the
contracting
officials
thought
acme's
bid
might
be
too
low,
these
were
the
government
officials,
and
in
view
of
its
inexperience
in
this
type
of
defense
work
and
the
government
offered
to
let
acme
withdraw
and
the
offer
of
acme
refused
and
let
the
bid
in.
of
course,
as
most
government
contracts
in
munitions,
the
project
was
largely
to
be
subcontracted
with
acme
furnishing
the
rifle
valve
and
the
finishing
and
assembling
the
component
parts
into
the
completed
rifles.
indeed,
because
of
the
large
amounts
of
subcontracting,
all
metals
industries,
the
principal
subcontractor,
whose
subcontract
was
to
amount
to
some
one
third
of
the
total
contract
price
participated
in
the
negotiations
for
the
prime
contract,
one
between
acme
and
the
army
and
its
subcontracting
plans
were
reviewed
by
the
army
itself.
within
a
few
weeks
after
the
prime
contract
was
awarded,
all
three
of
these
companies
which
tucker
had
kickback
agreements
with,
received
their
subcontracts.
ford
company
which
had
a
similar
arrangement
with
tucker's
father
also
obtained
the
subcontract
from
acme.
a
fifth
company
got
an
acme
subcontract
upon
the
recommendation
of
indeed
another
man
this
time,
one
phillip
jagner,
but
he
also
had
a
kickback
arrangement
with
the
company
and
who
was
on
acme's
payroll
as
an
assistant
to
norris.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
they
would
get
the
contract
--
that
this
subcontract
would
make
a
contract
with
acme
if
acme
could
get
its
contract
with
the
government.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
that
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
anybody
but
all
metals
participated
in
the
actual
negotiation
of
the
major
contract.
but
there
is
evidence
that
tucker
did
and
later
on
tucker
with
epstein's
son
went
to
all
metals
and
made
them
pay
them
twenty
some
thousand
dollars
more
even
after
the
kickback
had
been
paid.
it
would
be
i
--
i
would
assume
sir
but
it's
not
in
the
record
that
these
kickbacks
got
into
the
subcontract
price.
i
--
it's
not
in
the
record
but
it's
usually
what
happens;
and
then
the
contractor
in
turn
passes
that
inflation
on
to
the
united
states
government.
that's
when
the
interest
of
the
government
comes
in.
there
was
no
question
that
tucker
and
norris
would
take
in
care
of
tucker
and
norris,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
at
the
expense
of
anybody
they
could
find.
the
amount
of
money
that
all
metals
paid
was
not
the
twenty-five
thousand
but
the
agreement
was
--
they
ask
twenty-five
thousand,
all
metal
agreed
to
pay
twenty-three
five
hundred.
but
interestingly
enough
allegedly
for
a
“tax
gimmick”
they
had
it
paid
to
a
dummy
corporation
which
of
course
turned
out
to
be
tucker
and
norris'
dummy
corporation
so
that
the
subcontractor
was
able
to
cover
up
that
by
giving
it
to
this
dummy
corporation.
the
--
as
you
suspected
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
prime
contract
proved
unprofitable
for
acme
from
the
beginning.
and
by
july
of
1954,
it
delivered
less
than
half
of
the
rifles.
the
average
cost
to
acme
per
rifle
had
become
$877.77
and
a
substantial
loss
since
the
contract
price
was
only
$337.00.
and
when
the
army
learned
of
the
kickbacks,
as
well
as
the
other's
alleged
statutory
and
contractor
violation
not
relevant
here
because
we
didn't
bring
those
up,
it
cancelled
the
contract.
there
was
much
negotiation
within
the
government,
the
army
and
other
agencies
and
eventually
this
case
was
heard
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
it's
our
position,
the
--
of
course
the
--
acme
says
we
have
no
right
to
cancel
the
contract.
and
the
kickback
arrangement
we
say
were
prohibited
and
no
question
they
were
prohibited
under
the
anti-kickback
statute
which
is
41
u.s.c.
51
in
our
brief,
page
two
to
four.
so
in
short,
that
act
makes
the
payment
of
a
receipt
of
a
kickback
between
a
prime
contractor
and
a
subcontractor
a
crime.
it
also
makes
amount
of
the
kickback
recoverable
by
the
united
states.
it
does
not
of
course
--
it
does
not
provide
for
cancellation
of
the
contract.
but
we
contend
that
the
right
of
cancellation
of
this
contract
with
the
additional
sanction
of
non-enforcement
of
it
is
a
necessary
adjunct
to
the
remedies
specified
in
the
anti-kickback
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
nearest
the
knew
was
one
that
agents
of
the
government
told
senior
--
mr.
epstein
that
tucker's
father
was
a
five-percenter
and
he
should
look
into
--
deceived
by
tucker
because
--
well,
more
than
likely,
tucker
was
involved.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
all.
oh,
that
the
--
the
other
one
was,
they
knew
they
had
this
commission
agreement
with
them.
they
knew
that
they
were
working
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
epstein
and
the
corporation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
norris
and
tucker.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
acme,
that
they
would
work
on
a
commission
and
then
when
they
signed
their
applications
to
the
government,
they
made
two
and
three
different
statements
denying
this
and
then
once,
they
admitted
it.
so
they
knew
that
tucker
and
norris
were
dealing
with
other
corporations.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
norris.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
at
the
time
the
contract
was
made,
no,
i
don't
believe
they
did,
no.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
down
the
--
all
but
--
december
of
the
year,
that
they
started
early
in
the
year,
the
government
started
the
coming
in
and
showing
what
they
had
and
there
was
discussion
and
indeed
norris
was
fired
eventually,
and
norris
and
tucker
was
discharged.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
take
the
position
that
that
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
provide
and
that
was
true
at
the
time
for
this
reason
that
the
prime
contractor
was
doing
business
with
the
government
and
who
knows
that
the
government
has
made
it
clear
that
they
will
not
stand
for
kickbacks.
two,
as
in
respect
to
dixon
and
yates,
it's
difficult
to
undercover
--
to
uncover
these
people.
it's
to
put
the
responsibility
on
the
contractor
to
find
out
who
is
stealing
with
another
man
that
comes
in
the
streetlight,
that
norris
and
tucker
only
offering
one
thing
which
is
a
fast
dollar.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
it
as
whether
the
government
would
do
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
would
have
the
right
to,
the
answer
is
“yes.”
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
for
that
is
dixon
and
yates.
and
that's
where
the
--
we
part
three
ways,
four
ways,
the
commissioner,
the
court
of
claims,
acme
and
the
government
on
the
same
case.
in
the
dixon
and
yates
case,
the
government
contractor,
if
you
remember,
had
resulted
from
negotiations
which
became
tainted
by
a
government
representative
who
was
also
connected
with
the
bank.
having
found
that
these
individuals'
conduct
to
have
violated
the
federal
conflict
of
interest
statute,
this
court
upheld
the
government's
cancellation
of
the
contract
and
we
think
that
the
real
test,
we
can
argue
the
language
was
both
ways.
but
cancellation
we
urge
is
necessary
in
cases
of
this
type,
the
same
as
dixon
and
yates
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
government.
now
on
the
other
hand,
acme
and
judge
davis
of
the
court
below
attempted
to
distinguish
dixon
and
yates
on
two
grounds.
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
involved
in
dixon
and
yates
provided
only
a
criminal
sanction
and
did
not
have
the
recovery
section
and
while
the
anti-kickback
statute
provides
in
addition
to
the
criminal
penalty
the
civil
penalty.
and
secondly,
that
in
this
case,
the
contractor
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
offending
officials
because
it
did
not
have
specific
knowledge
of
the
kickback
activity.
while
in
dixon
and
yates,
the
contractor
knew
of
the
dual
status
of
the
government
representatives
who
was
obliged
to
know.
now
to
this
contention
the
respondents
also
words
that
the
prime
contract
is
not
tainted
by
the
illegality
because
the
kickbacks
were
paid
after
the
contract
had
been
signed.
well
now,
we
think
dixon
and
yates
should
not
be
narrowly
construed.
just
as
in
dixon
and
yates,
non-enforcement
may
fairly
be
implied
here
as
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policy
underlying
this
federal
statute
preventing
corruptness
in
the
federal
procurement
processes.
i
think
it's
even
more
important
to
emphasize
that
a
part
of
the
reason
which
the
respondents
rely
on
is
that
the
government
was
anxious
that
they
should
have
this
contract
if
they
could
do
it
because
they
were
anxious
in
getting
smaller
companies
into
this
type
of
business.
to
be
sure
the
statute
here
involved
unlike
that
in
dixon
and
yates
provides
a
civil
remedy,
it
sure
does,
so
the
government
could
recover
the
amount
of
the
kickbacks.
but
that
civil
remedy
does
not
obviate
the
principal
incurious
consequences
of
the
kickbacks
themselves
because
you
don't
find
them
out
until
it's
too
late.
a
subcontractor
owes
his
subcontractor
a
bribe
cannot
be
considered
fully
liable
and
to
take
all
the
type
of
protection
that
they
seem
to
offer.
the
price
of
the
subcontract
may
well
be
inflated
by
more
than
the
amount
of
the
kickbacks.
for
a
subcontractor
who
have
--
expects
to
obtain
a
subcontract
in
exchange
for
a
bribe
has
less
incentive
to
make
a
realistic
appraisal
of
either
cost
or
profit.
and
unless
the
government
is
entitled
to
cancel,
it
will
be
bound
to
contracts
like
this
one
here
conceived
in
corruptness
and
on
that
conceived
and
corruptness,
i
come
back
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
not
the
corruptness
of
acme
as
such
but
the
corruptness
of
people
that
acme
has
taken
in
and
given
responsible
positions.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
all
these
--
the
two
people,
tucker
and
norris,
they
got
the
contract,
they
did
all
of
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
the
government.
they
did
all
of
the
negotiating
and
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
they
were
the
ones.
you
see,
acme,
as
i
read
the
findings
of
the
record,
acme
wanted
to
diversify
and
they
didn't
know
how
to
do
it.
and
simultaneously
as
to
who
brought
about
the
meeting,
that's
not
clear
to
me.
but
tucker
and
norris
showed
up
and
it
was
just
what
acme
was
looking
for.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we'd
--
i
don't
--
i
--
you
don't
have
to
but
you
can,
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
your
criminal
case?
the
criminal
case
was
just
a
district
court
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
the
holding.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
contract
if
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
contend
both
of
them
apply
to
this.
we
don't
give
away
the
old
statute
to
all
of
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
or
the
new
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
--
that's
why
i
say
i
don't
need
the
new
one.
the
government
doesn't
need
the
new
one.
we
think
that
under
the
old
one
we
could
still
come
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it's
no
help
at
all,
we're
out
of
the
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
no
help
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
doubts
about
remedy
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i'm
relying
on
dixon
and
yates.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
get
under
dixon
and
yates.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
hate
to
say
that
because
i
just
don't
see
how
this
court
can
hold
that
under
this
statute
the
kick
--
that
the
kickback
statute
has
not
been
violated.
i
don't
--
it's
not
conceivable
how
or
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
tucker
and
norris
took
kickbacks.
i
don't
think
anybody
denies
that.
i
don't
think
anybody
denies
that
epstein's
son
took
kickbacks.
there
were
kickbacks
there,
i
don't
think
anybody
denies
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
get
that
because
all
of
these,
well
not
all,
but
most
of
the
cancellation
law
that
anybody
has
cited
as
judge-made
law,
not
statute-made
law.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
cancellation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
on
cancellations,
period.
and
cancellations
can
come
about
because
of
a
statute,
dixon
and
yates.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
were
--
i
would
hate
to
be
driven
to
the
common
law
position
but
i
frankly
don't
have
the
answer
mr.
justice.
we
have
discussed
the
whole
common
law
in
--
it
was
in
a
footnote
to
back
that,
but
i
think
we've
been
greatly
difficult
and
i
hate
to
be
driven
there.
because
in
this
case,
it
appears
to
me
that
congress
is
interested
in
one
thing,
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
contracts
which
spends
the
money
that
it
--
his
trustee
to
handle.
secondly,
to
get
rid
of
shoddy
business
dealings.
and
i
don't
think
congress,
at
any
time,
meant
to
take
away
anything;
cancellation
by
common
law
or
whatever
you
might
have.
i
think
that
when
congress
passes
the
kickback
statutes,
the
conflicts
of
interest
statutes
etcetera,
they
expect
that
the
government
shall
use
them
for
the
purpose
of
cleaning
up
the
business.
and
in
any
case
of
this
type,
as
in
dixon
and
yates,
and
this
would
be
the
same
thing,
it's
hard
to
uncover
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
despite
the
finding
on
one
point
and
the
argument
of
the
respondents,
the
government
didn't
have
a
clear
cut
case
on
this
right
away.
they
--
the
philadelphia
ordinates
state
poll
went
in
court,
eventually
looks
from
the
record,
the
fbi
was
in
it,
and
they
got
to
this
one
through
the
dummy
corporation
that
tucker
and
norris
had
set
up.
that's
how
we
got
around
to
it
whereas,
if
acme
has
used
some
judgment
of
responsibility
once
they
were
tipped
off
that
tucker
was
kind
of
--
his
father
was
illicit
five-percenter
and
once
they
found
that
they
had
these
other
contracts,
they
could
have
done
something
to
find
out
whether
or
not
tucker
and
norris
were
engaged
in
kickbacks.
in
having
failed
to
do
it,
they
now
say
that
they
are
now
entitled
to
damages.
and
indeed
in
dixon
and
yates,
most
of
these
things
were
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
pointed
out?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
this
case,
they
did
have
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
would
certainly
do
it
but
i
don't
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
never,
well,
i'd
have
to
add
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
never
should
have
learned.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
want
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
in
that
type
of
case
the
government
just
wouldn't
ask
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
kickbacks
should've
get
back
under
the
statutes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
the
point
would
be
as
to
when
you
would've
cancelled.
i
mean
--
if
the
--
if
then
it's
not
the
question
of
cancelling,
i
think
then
automatically
you
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
performed?
if
that's
the
way
it
look
then
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
would
have
the
--
i
would
say,
you'd
have
the
right
to
cancel
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
its
not
a
--
there
is
a
serious
of
question
at
time
as
to
whether
you
would
or
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
--
positively,
that
is
our
position
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
was
--
get
ready
to
in
--
since
my
time
is
waved
out,
i'd
just
like
to
telescope
it.
we've
got
it
set
out
in
--
pretty
well
in
a
brief
and
it's
very
well
involved.
but
it's
our
position
that
even
if
it's
found
that
we
did
not
have
the
right
to
cancel,
that
acme
shouldn't
get
more
money
than
it
would've
gotten
if
it
has
finished
the
contract.
the
difference
is
that
if
under
the
government's
theory,
the
commissioners
found
that
if
we
cancel
under
the
regular
phrase
we
would
owe
around
$314,000.
the
court
of
claims
says
it's
673.
if
you
break
than
down,
they
would
be
getting
eight
hundred
and
some
dollars
per
rifle.
for
rifles
which
they
agreed
to
sell
for
three
hundred
and
some
a
piece.
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
it's
found
that
the
government
did
not
have
right
--
didn't
have
the
right
to
cancel
the
contract
acme
cannot
make
a
profit
on
it.
they
had
already
been
loosing
money.
they
should
not
be
given
back
the
money
that
they
have
already
lost.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
certainly
not
punitive
damages.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
just
about.
we
--
we
follow,
if
we
have
to
we'll
prolong
the
commission.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
believe
that
a
man,
assuming
that
acme,
even
if
it's
found
we
don't
have
the
right
to
cancel
the
contract,
acme
was
responsible
for
it's
own
problem.
it's
underbid,
the
government
offered
to
let
them
withdraw
it,
they
told
them,
“you
will
loose
money
on
it.”
they
insisted
on
doing
it.
they
lost
their
money.
should
the
government
pay
them
for
the
money
they
lost?
there's
no
reason
under
the
sun
that
i
can
i
see
to
pay
them
for
what
they
lost
because
of
what
they
did.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
would
--
they
couldn't
get
specific
performance,
that's
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
$337.00
a
piece.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
could
--
they
could
recover,
we
--
if
we
have
to
at
that
stage,
we
agree
to
commissioners.
this
is
the
amount
of
money
that
they
can
prove.
you
see,
we've
been
paying
for
these
rifles
all
along.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
337
as
i
remember.
we've
been
paying
for
these
all
along.
so
this
is
proposed,
as
i
understand
the
commissioner
to
pay
them
for
the
rest
of
them
and
deduct
what
they've
already
been
paid.
but
the
court
of
claims
comes
up
with
these
unbelievable
figures
of
673,000
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
in
addition
to
what
they
already
have
been
paid.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
approximately
400,000.
the
--
if
i
may,
the
figure
in
the
brief
which
is
77
or
record
77,
over
$300,000
figure.
we
have
rechecked
with
the
department,
the
division,
they
say
they're
figured
because
of
the
400,000.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
at
the
rate,
they
will
go
on
and
they
would
come
down
slowly
but
they
would
never
get
down
all
the
way.
if
you
look
at
it,
you
can
see
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
was
what
it
would
be
except
for
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
found
that
it
was
not
there.
i
could
save
a
few
minutes
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
70?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
it's
on
--
its
page
28
and
note
24.
let
me
see
if
that's
right.
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
two
points
on
the
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas
about
how
minor
an
official
norris
is
on
page
125
of
the
record.
in
finding
3,
it
was
agreed
that
he
was
to
be
the
manager
of
this
new
plant,
he
was
no
minor
official.
as
to
the
reasons
he
was
discharged,
it's
on
page
131
--
148.
and
one
of
the
grounds,
i
believe
it
is
not
is
your
voluntary
abandonment
of
your
duties
without
exact
permission
and
the
one
before
that
is
because
you're
being
investigated
by
the
fbi.
and
the
fbi
was
investigating
for
putting
some
farm
equipments
out
there.
the
answer
to
the
question
as
to
the
reason
the
government
chose
this
is
on
page
204
where
it
said
that
the
government
was
not
the
--
the
alleged
violation,
instead
of
terminating
it
for
convenience
of
the
government
was
not
control
by
consideration
of
termination
cost
but
rather
by
the
army's
interest
in
promoting
morality
in
public
procurement.
and
i
say
finally,
and
this
is
exactly
our
point
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
are
obliging
the
government
to
make
these
people
stop
permitting
kickbacks
in
their
business.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
the
government
will
be
obliged
to
sit
around
and
file
a
suit
and
try
to
get
his
kickback
money
back
and
i
submit
that
is
no
deterrent.
and
on
the
question
of
damages,
i
think
it's
unbelievable
that
the
respondents
are
asking
the
court
of
claims
to
say
that
if
this
contract
had
run
to
its
conclusion,
nobody
would
dispute
that
acme
would
lose
money
but
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
contract
is
cut
in
the
middle
and
acme
makes
money.
so
the
government
could
very
well
have
kept
on
and
acme
would
have
been
broke.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
what
they're
asking
for,
one
of
the
court
of
claims
gives
them
is
that
they
--
because
of
their
own
inefficiency
which
the
court
of
claims
found,
the
government
has
to
pay
them
for
their
inefficiency.
and
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
reversed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
review
of
the
decision
and
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
cancel
the
contract
with
acme
process
equipment
company
for
the
violation
of
the
anti-kickback
statute
committed
allegedly
by
key
officials
of
that
company.
in
addition
to
court
of
claims,
disagreeing
with
its
trial
commissioner
in
contrary
we
say
to
the
traditional
measure
of
damages
permitted
acme
restitutional
relief,
that
is,
it
measured
acme's
damages
by
the
costs
the
company
had
expanded
thus
putting
acme
in
the
position
it
occupied
before
the
contract
was
made.
that
measure
resulted,
we
will
contend
in
an
unjustified
windfall
to
acme
since
ordinary
damages
would
have
been
compensated
for
the
loss
caused
by
the
breach.
on
this
hearing,
we
alleged
two
points.
the
first
issue,
the
first
question
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
government
is
entitled
in
the
case
of
this
type
to
cancel
a
contract
because
responsible
officials
of
the
prime
contractor
have
accepted
kickbacks
from
some
contractors
in
violation
of
the
specific
statute
prohibiting
such
kickbacks.
and
the
second
question
is
that
if
the
government
was
not
justified
in
canceling
the
contract
from
statutory
violations,
then
an
additional
issue
is
presented
as
to
the
proper
measure
of
damages
for
the
alleged
breach
of
contract.
the
salient
facts
surrounding
the
kickbacks
are
as
follows:
acme
was
a
company
owned
by
joshua
epstein,
samuel
fisher,
their
children
and
other
close
relatives.
they
manufactured
boilers
and
other
items
of
the
likes
--
type
of
machinery.
in
1952,
it
became
interested
in
diversifying.
and
in
october
of
that
year,
it
hired
james
s.
norris
and
harry
j.
tucker,
jr.
who
represented
themselves
as
experts
in
obtaining
and
administering
government
procurement
contracts.
indeed,
ensure
--
norris
was
proposed
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
would
become
the
general
manager
for
production
and
tucker
was
placed
in
charge
of
sales
and
government
contracts
and
have
proposed
new
addition
to
the
acme
firm
in
a
plant
yet
to
be
leased.
tucker
had
already
made
arrangements
with
several
companies
under
which
he
was
to
receive
kickbacks
on
sales
by
the
companies
to
customers
procured
by
him
and
these
would
include
of
course
acme.
indeed,
tucker
agreed
to
share
these
kickbacks
to
norris.
one
of
these
companies
develops
as
all
metals
industries
which
would
become
the
principal
subcontractor.
tucker
heard
that
the
army
ordinates
corps
in
philadelphia
was
the
contractor,
the
manufacturer
of
recoilless
rifles,
seventy
five
millimeter
rifles;
and
acting
on
tucker's
advice
that
a
bid
of
$350
per
rifle
would
probably
insure
an
award
of
contract,
acme
submitted
a
bid
of
$337.23
per
rifle.
acme's
bid
was
signed
by
norris.
sometime
between
the
date
of
the
bid
and
the
award
of
the
contracts
three
months
later,
the
army
ordinates
corps
advised
acme
that
it
was
--
it
might
have
been
a
mistake
for
them
to
have
hired
tucker
because
tucker's
father
was
suspected
of
kickback
activities.
but
joshua
epstein,
the
president
of
acme,
ignored
this
advice
and
made
no
effort
to
investigate
tucker
despite
the
fact
that
tucker's
contract
with
acme
included
a
provision
that
he
represent
and
will
continue
to
represent
firms
in
other
lines
of
business.
one
point
i
should
mention
on
the
rifles,
the
bid
of
three
$337.23
was
far
below
any
other
bid.
for
example,
the
two
other
bids
were
$484
and
$930
respectively.
and
the
two
final
bids
were
four
hundred
twenty
three
and
six
hundred
and
eighty
four.
but
acme
put
in
a
bid
of
three
hundred
thirty
seven
and
twenty-three
cents.
on
january
1953,
the
contractor
for
the
manufacturing
of
2751
recoilless
rifles
was
awarded
to
acme
as
the
low
bidder.
but
the
contracting
officials
thought
acme's
bid
might
be
too
low,
these
were
the
government
officials,
and
in
view
of
its
inexperience
in
this
type
of
defense
work
and
the
government
offered
to
let
acme
withdraw
and
the
offer
of
acme
refused
and
let
the
bid
in.
of
course,
as
most
government
contracts
in
munitions,
the
project
was
largely
to
be
subcontracted
with
acme
furnishing
the
rifle
valve
and
the
finishing
and
assembling
the
component
parts
into
the
completed
rifles.
indeed,
because
of
the
large
amounts
of
subcontracting,
all
metals
industries,
the
principal
subcontractor,
whose
subcontract
was
to
amount
to
some
one
third
of
the
total
contract
price
participated
in
the
negotiations
for
the
prime
contract,
one
between
acme
and
the
army
and
its
subcontracting
plans
were
reviewed
by
the
army
itself.
within
a
few
weeks
after
the
prime
contract
was
awarded,
all
three
of
these
companies
which
tucker
had
kickback
agreements
with,
received
their
subcontracts.
ford
company
which
had
a
similar
arrangement
with
tucker's
father
also
obtained
the
subcontract
from
acme.
a
fifth
company
got
an
acme
subcontract
upon
the
recommendation
of
indeed
another
man
this
time,
one
phillip
jagner,
but
he
also
had
a
kickback
arrangement
with
the
company
and
who
was
on
acme's
payroll
as
an
assistant
to
norris.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
they
would
get
the
contract
--
that
this
subcontract
would
make
a
contract
with
acme
if
acme
could
get
its
contract
with
the
government.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
that
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
anybody
but
all
metals
participated
in
the
actual
negotiation
of
the
major
contract.
but
there
is
evidence
that
tucker
did
and
later
on
tucker
with
epstein's
son
went
to
all
metals
and
made
them
pay
them
twenty
some
thousand
dollars
more
even
after
the
kickback
had
been
paid.
it
would
be
i
--
i
would
assume
sir
but
it's
not
in
the
record
that
these
kickbacks
got
into
the
subcontract
price.
i
--
it's
not
in
the
record
but
it's
usually
what
happens;
and
then
the
contractor
in
turn
passes
that
inflation
on
to
the
united
states
government.
that's
when
the
interest
of
the
government
comes
in.
there
was
no
question
that
tucker
and
norris
would
take
in
care
of
tucker
and
norris,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
at
the
expense
of
anybody
they
could
find.
the
amount
of
money
that
all
metals
paid
was
not
the
twenty-five
thousand
but
the
agreement
was
--
they
ask
twenty-five
thousand,
all
metal
agreed
to
pay
twenty-three
five
hundred.
but
interestingly
enough
allegedly
for
a
“tax
gimmick”
they
had
it
paid
to
a
dummy
corporation
which
of
course
turned
out
to
be
tucker
and
norris'
dummy
corporation
so
that
the
subcontractor
was
able
to
cover
up
that
by
giving
it
to
this
dummy
corporation.
the
--
as
you
suspected
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
prime
contract
proved
unprofitable
for
acme
from
the
beginning.
and
by
july
of
1954,
it
delivered
less
than
half
of
the
rifles.
the
average
cost
to
acme
per
rifle
had
become
$877.77
and
a
substantial
loss
since
the
contract
price
was
only
$337.00.
and
when
the
army
learned
of
the
kickbacks,
as
well
as
the
other's
alleged
statutory
and
contractor
violation
not
relevant
here
because
we
didn't
bring
those
up,
it
cancelled
the
contract.
there
was
much
negotiation
within
the
government,
the
army
and
other
agencies
and
eventually
this
case
was
heard
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
it's
our
position,
the
--
of
course
the
--
acme
says
we
have
no
right
to
cancel
the
contract.
and
the
kickback
arrangement
we
say
were
prohibited
and
no
question
they
were
prohibited
under
the
anti-kickback
statute
which
is
41
u.s.c.
51
in
our
brief,
page
two
to
four.
so
in
short,
that
act
makes
the
payment
of
a
receipt
of
a
kickback
between
a
prime
contractor
and
a
subcontractor
a
crime.
it
also
makes
amount
of
the
kickback
recoverable
by
the
united
states.
it
does
not
of
course
--
it
does
not
provide
for
cancellation
of
the
contract.
but
we
contend
that
the
right
of
cancellation
of
this
contract
with
the
additional
sanction
of
non-enforcement
of
it
is
a
necessary
adjunct
to
the
remedies
specified
in
the
anti-kickback
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
nearest
the
knew
was
one
that
agents
of
the
government
told
senior
--
mr.
epstein
that
tucker's
father
was
a
five-percenter
and
he
should
look
into
--
deceived
by
tucker
because
--
well,
more
than
likely,
tucker
was
involved.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
all.
oh,
that
the
--
the
other
one
was,
they
knew
they
had
this
commission
agreement
with
them.
they
knew
that
they
were
working
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
epstein
and
the
corporation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
norris
and
tucker.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
acme,
that
they
would
work
on
a
commission
and
then
when
they
signed
their
applications
to
the
government,
they
made
two
and
three
different
statements
denying
this
and
then
once,
they
admitted
it.
so
they
knew
that
tucker
and
norris
were
dealing
with
other
corporations.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
norris.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
at
the
time
the
contract
was
made,
no,
i
don't
believe
they
did,
no.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
down
the
--
all
but
--
december
of
the
year,
that
they
started
early
in
the
year,
the
government
started
the
coming
in
and
showing
what
they
had
and
there
was
discussion
and
indeed
norris
was
fired
eventually,
and
norris
and
tucker
was
discharged.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
take
the
position
that
that
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
provide
and
that
was
true
at
the
time
for
this
reason
that
the
prime
contractor
was
doing
business
with
the
government
and
who
knows
that
the
government
has
made
it
clear
that
they
will
not
stand
for
kickbacks.
two,
as
in
respect
to
dixon
and
yates,
it's
difficult
to
undercover
--
to
uncover
these
people.
it's
to
put
the
responsibility
on
the
contractor
to
find
out
who
is
stealing
with
another
man
that
comes
in
the
streetlight,
that
norris
and
tucker
only
offering
one
thing
which
is
a
fast
dollar.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
it
as
whether
the
government
would
do
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
would
have
the
right
to,
the
answer
is
“yes.”
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
for
that
is
dixon
and
yates.
and
that's
where
the
--
we
part
three
ways,
four
ways,
the
commissioner,
the
court
of
claims,
acme
and
the
government
on
the
same
case.
in
the
dixon
and
yates
case,
the
government
contractor,
if
you
remember,
had
resulted
from
negotiations
which
became
tainted
by
a
government
representative
who
was
also
connected
with
the
bank.
having
found
that
these
individuals'
conduct
to
have
violated
the
federal
conflict
of
interest
statute,
this
court
upheld
the
government's
cancellation
of
the
contract
and
we
think
that
the
real
test,
we
can
argue
the
language
was
both
ways.
but
cancellation
we
urge
is
necessary
in
cases
of
this
type,
the
same
as
dixon
and
yates
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
government.
now
on
the
other
hand,
acme
and
judge
davis
of
the
court
below
attempted
to
distinguish
dixon
and
yates
on
two
grounds.
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
involved
in
dixon
and
yates
provided
only
a
criminal
sanction
and
did
not
have
the
recovery
section
and
while
the
anti-kickback
statute
provides
in
addition
to
the
criminal
penalty
the
civil
penalty.
and
secondly,
that
in
this
case,
the
contractor
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
offending
officials
because
it
did
not
have
specific
knowledge
of
the
kickback
activity.
while
in
dixon
and
yates,
the
contractor
knew
of
the
dual
status
of
the
government
representatives
who
was
obliged
to
know.
now
to
this
contention
the
respondents
also
words
that
the
prime
contract
is
not
tainted
by
the
illegality
because
the
kickbacks
were
paid
after
the
contract
had
been
signed.
well
now,
we
think
dixon
and
yates
should
not
be
narrowly
construed.
just
as
in
dixon
and
yates,
non-enforcement
may
fairly
be
implied
here
as
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policy
underlying
this
federal
statute
preventing
corruptness
in
the
federal
procurement
processes.
i
think
it's
even
more
important
to
emphasize
that
a
part
of
the
reason
which
the
respondents
rely
on
is
that
the
government
was
anxious
that
they
should
have
this
contract
if
they
could
do
it
because
they
were
anxious
in
getting
smaller
companies
into
this
type
of
business.
to
be
sure
the
statute
here
involved
unlike
that
in
dixon
and
yates
provides
a
civil
remedy,
it
sure
does,
so
the
government
could
recover
the
amount
of
the
kickbacks.
but
that
civil
remedy
does
not
obviate
the
principal
incurious
consequences
of
the
kickbacks
themselves
because
you
don't
find
them
out
until
it's
too
late.
a
subcontractor
owes
his
subcontractor
a
bribe
cannot
be
considered
fully
liable
and
to
take
all
the
type
of
protection
that
they
seem
to
offer.
the
price
of
the
subcontract
may
well
be
inflated
by
more
than
the
amount
of
the
kickbacks.
for
a
subcontractor
who
have
--
expects
to
obtain
a
subcontract
in
exchange
for
a
bribe
has
less
incentive
to
make
a
realistic
appraisal
of
either
cost
or
profit.
and
unless
the
government
is
entitled
to
cancel,
it
will
be
bound
to
contracts
like
this
one
here
conceived
in
corruptness
and
on
that
conceived
and
corruptness,
i
come
back
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
not
the
corruptness
of
acme
as
such
but
the
corruptness
of
people
that
acme
has
taken
in
and
given
responsible
positions.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
all
these
--
the
two
people,
tucker
and
norris,
they
got
the
contract,
they
did
all
of
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
the
government.
they
did
all
of
the
negotiating
and
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
they
were
the
ones.
you
see,
acme,
as
i
read
the
findings
of
the
record,
acme
wanted
to
diversify
and
they
didn't
know
how
to
do
it.
and
simultaneously
as
to
who
brought
about
the
meeting,
that's
not
clear
to
me.
but
tucker
and
norris
showed
up
and
it
was
just
what
acme
was
looking
for.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we'd
--
i
don't
--
i
--
you
don't
have
to
but
you
can,
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
your
criminal
case?
the
criminal
case
was
just
a
district
court
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
the
holding.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
contract
if
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
contend
both
of
them
apply
to
this.
we
don't
give
away
the
old
statute
to
all
of
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
or
the
new
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
--
that's
why
i
say
i
don't
need
the
new
one.
the
government
doesn't
need
the
new
one.
we
think
that
under
the
old
one
we
could
still
come
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it's
no
help
at
all,
we're
out
of
the
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
no
help
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
doubts
about
remedy
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i'm
relying
on
dixon
and
yates.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
get
under
dixon
and
yates.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
hate
to
say
that
because
i
just
don't
see
how
this
court
can
hold
that
under
this
statute
the
kick
--
that
the
kickback
statute
has
not
been
violated.
i
don't
--
it's
not
conceivable
how
or
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
tucker
and
norris
took
kickbacks.
i
don't
think
anybody
denies
that.
i
don't
think
anybody
denies
that
epstein's
son
took
kickbacks.
there
were
kickbacks
there,
i
don't
think
anybody
denies
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
get
that
because
all
of
these,
well
not
all,
but
most
of
the
cancellation
law
that
anybody
has
cited
as
judge-made
law,
not
statute-made
law.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
cancellation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
on
cancellations,
period.
and
cancellations
can
come
about
because
of
a
statute,
dixon
and
yates.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
were
--
i
would
hate
to
be
driven
to
the
common
law
position
but
i
frankly
don't
have
the
answer
mr.
justice.
we
have
discussed
the
whole
common
law
in
--
it
was
in
a
footnote
to
back
that,
but
i
think
we've
been
greatly
difficult
and
i
hate
to
be
driven
there.
because
in
this
case,
it
appears
to
me
that
congress
is
interested
in
one
thing,
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
contracts
which
spends
the
money
that
it
--
his
trustee
to
handle.
secondly,
to
get
rid
of
shoddy
business
dealings.
and
i
don't
think
congress,
at
any
time,
meant
to
take
away
anything;
cancellation
by
common
law
or
whatever
you
might
have.
i
think
that
when
congress
passes
the
kickback
statutes,
the
conflicts
of
interest
statutes
etcetera,
they
expect
that
the
government
shall
use
them
for
the
purpose
of
cleaning
up
the
business.
and
in
any
case
of
this
type,
as
in
dixon
and
yates,
and
this
would
be
the
same
thing,
it's
hard
to
uncover
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
despite
the
finding
on
one
point
and
the
argument
of
the
respondents,
the
government
didn't
have
a
clear
cut
case
on
this
right
away.
they
--
the
philadelphia
ordinates
state
poll
went
in
court,
eventually
looks
from
the
record,
the
fbi
was
in
it,
and
they
got
to
this
one
through
the
dummy
corporation
that
tucker
and
norris
had
set
up.
that's
how
we
got
around
to
it
whereas,
if
acme
has
used
some
judgment
of
responsibility
once
they
were
tipped
off
that
tucker
was
kind
of
--
his
father
was
illicit
five-percenter
and
once
they
found
that
they
had
these
other
contracts,
they
could
have
done
something
to
find
out
whether
or
not
tucker
and
norris
were
engaged
in
kickbacks.
in
having
failed
to
do
it,
they
now
say
that
they
are
now
entitled
to
damages.
and
indeed
in
dixon
and
yates,
most
of
these
things
were
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
pointed
out?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
this
case,
they
did
have
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
would
certainly
do
it
but
i
don't
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
never,
well,
i'd
have
to
add
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
never
should
have
learned.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
want
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
in
that
type
of
case
the
government
just
wouldn't
ask
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
kickbacks
should've
get
back
under
the
statutes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
the
point
would
be
as
to
when
you
would've
cancelled.
i
mean
--
if
the
--
if
then
it's
not
the
question
of
cancelling,
i
think
then
automatically
you
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
performed?
if
that's
the
way
it
look
then
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
would
have
the
--
i
would
say,
you'd
have
the
right
to
cancel
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
its
not
a
--
there
is
a
serious
of
question
at
time
as
to
whether
you
would
or
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
--
positively,
that
is
our
position
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
was
--
get
ready
to
in
--
since
my
time
is
waved
out,
i'd
just
like
to
telescope
it.
we've
got
it
set
out
in
--
pretty
well
in
a
brief
and
it's
very
well
involved.
but
it's
our
position
that
even
if
it's
found
that
we
did
not
have
the
right
to
cancel,
that
acme
shouldn't
get
more
money
than
it
would've
gotten
if
it
has
finished
the
contract.
the
difference
is
that
if
under
the
government's
theory,
the
commissioners
found
that
if
we
cancel
under
the
regular
phrase
we
would
owe
around
$314,000.
the
court
of
claims
says
it's
673.
if
you
break
than
down,
they
would
be
getting
eight
hundred
and
some
dollars
per
rifle.
for
rifles
which
they
agreed
to
sell
for
three
hundred
and
some
a
piece.
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
it's
found
that
the
government
did
not
have
right
--
didn't
have
the
right
to
cancel
the
contract
acme
cannot
make
a
profit
on
it.
they
had
already
been
loosing
money.
they
should
not
be
given
back
the
money
that
they
have
already
lost.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
certainly
not
punitive
damages.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
just
about.
we
--
we
follow,
if
we
have
to
we'll
prolong
the
commission.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
believe
that
a
man,
assuming
that
acme,
even
if
it's
found
we
don't
have
the
right
to
cancel
the
contract,
acme
was
responsible
for
it's
own
problem.
it's
underbid,
the
government
offered
to
let
them
withdraw
it,
they
told
them,
“you
will
loose
money
on
it.”
they
insisted
on
doing
it.
they
lost
their
money.
should
the
government
pay
them
for
the
money
they
lost?
there's
no
reason
under
the
sun
that
i
can
i
see
to
pay
them
for
what
they
lost
because
of
what
they
did.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
would
--
they
couldn't
get
specific
performance,
that's
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
$337.00
a
piece.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
could
--
they
could
recover,
we
--
if
we
have
to
at
that
stage,
we
agree
to
commissioners.
this
is
the
amount
of
money
that
they
can
prove.
you
see,
we've
been
paying
for
these
rifles
all
along.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
337
as
i
remember.
we've
been
paying
for
these
all
along.
so
this
is
proposed,
as
i
understand
the
commissioner
to
pay
them
for
the
rest
of
them
and
deduct
what
they've
already
been
paid.
but
the
court
of
claims
comes
up
with
these
unbelievable
figures
of
673,000
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
in
addition
to
what
they
already
have
been
paid.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
approximately
400,000.
the
--
if
i
may,
the
figure
in
the
brief
which
is
77
or
record
77,
over
$300,000
figure.
we
have
rechecked
with
the
department,
the
division,
they
say
they're
figured
because
of
the
400,000.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
at
the
rate,
they
will
go
on
and
they
would
come
down
slowly
but
they
would
never
get
down
all
the
way.
if
you
look
at
it,
you
can
see
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
was
what
it
would
be
except
for
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
found
that
it
was
not
there.
i
could
save
a
few
minutes
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
70?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
it's
on
--
its
page
28
and
note
24.
let
me
see
if
that's
right.
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
two
points
on
the
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas
about
how
minor
an
official
norris
is
on
page
125
of
the
record.
in
finding
3,
it
was
agreed
that
he
was
to
be
the
manager
of
this
new
plant,
he
was
no
minor
official.
as
to
the
reasons
he
was
discharged,
it's
on
page
131
--
148.
and
one
of
the
grounds,
i
believe
it
is
not
is
your
voluntary
abandonment
of
your
duties
without
exact
permission
and
the
one
before
that
is
because
you're
being
investigated
by
the
fbi.
and
the
fbi
was
investigating
for
putting
some
farm
equipments
out
there.
the
answer
to
the
question
as
to
the
reason
the
government
chose
this
is
on
page
204
where
it
said
that
the
government
was
not
the
--
the
alleged
violation,
instead
of
terminating
it
for
convenience
of
the
government
was
not
control
by
consideration
of
termination
cost
but
rather
by
the
army's
interest
in
promoting
morality
in
public
procurement.
and
i
say
finally,
and
this
is
exactly
our
point
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
are
obliging
the
government
to
make
these
people
stop
permitting
kickbacks
in
their
business.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
the
government
will
be
obliged
to
sit
around
and
file
a
suit
and
try
to
get
his
kickback
money
back
and
i
submit
that
is
no
deterrent.
and
on
the
question
of
damages,
i
think
it's
unbelievable
that
the
respondents
are
asking
the
court
of
claims
to
say
that
if
this
contract
had
run
to
its
conclusion,
nobody
would
dispute
that
acme
would
lose
money
but
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
contract
is
cut
in
the
middle
and
acme
makes
money.
so
the
government
could
very
well
have
kept
on
and
acme
would
have
been
broke.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
what
they're
asking
for,
one
of
the
court
of
claims
gives
them
is
that
they
--
because
of
their
own
inefficiency
which
the
court
of
claims
found,
the
government
has
to
pay
them
for
their
inefficiency.
and
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
reversed.
