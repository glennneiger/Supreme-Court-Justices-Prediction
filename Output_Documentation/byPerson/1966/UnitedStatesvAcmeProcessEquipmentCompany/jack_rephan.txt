mr.
jack
rephan
mister
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
initially
to
clear
out
some
of
the
factual
statements
because
i
think
the
facts
here
are
very
important.
most
importantly,
the
court
of
claims
found
as
a
fact
that
none
of
the
responsible
officials
of
acme
knew
anything
about
the
kickback
arrangements
until
after
the
cancellation
of
acme's
contract.
the
only
people
who
knew
about
these
kickback
arrangements
were
of
course
the
conspirators
themselves,
that
was
tucker
and
norris
and
jack
epstein.
now
norris
had
been
discharged
earlier
but
the
reason
norris
was
discharged
was
because
it
was
discovered
that
norris
had
charged
some
personal
farm
expenses
to
the
acme
contract
and
for
this
reason
he
was
fired.
at
this
point,
acme
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
kickback
arrangements.
mr.
jack
rephan
tucker's
--
mr.
jack
rephan
tucker
was
initially
hired
to
be
an
expediter
and
because
he
said
that
he
had
knowledge
in
the
field
of
government
contract
law
and
commercial
contracts
and
he
was
initially
retained
to
drum
up
business
generally
for
government
and
commercial
contracts
as
well.
mr.
jack
rephan
he
was
initially
on
a
commission
basis.
the
court
of
claims
didn't
directly
decide
there
was
a
violation
of
the
contingent
fee
covenant.
they
say
that
this
was
unnecessary
since
the
government
had
waited
fourteen
months
after
obtaining
knowledge
of
the
contract
with
tucker;
that
it
was
too
late
for
the
government
to
then
cancel
for
a
violation
of
the
contingent
fee
covenant.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
rephan
he
was
not
an
officer.
he
held
some
stock
but
it
was
non-voting
stock.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
at
that
time,
that's
true.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor
and
we
do
not
deny
that
he
was
an
employee.
as
to
whether
he
was
an
important,
there
was
some
dispute
about
this.
we
maintain
that
he
was
an
employee
but
he
was
not
a
major
employee.
of
course,
he
was
the
son
of
the
president
and
we
think
the
government
is
trying
to
make
quite
a
bit
out
of
this
but
we
think
it's
not
that
important
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
jack
rephan
there
were
several
statements,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
norris
was
given
the
authority
to
sign
contracts
initially.
most
of
them
were
signed
by
mr.
norris.
mr.
jack
rephan
to
sign
the
bids
initially.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
at
the
time
acme
hired
mr.
norris
and
mr.
tucker
--
of
course,
they
had
already
entered
into
agreements
with
the
others
--
some
of
the
other
subcontractors.
however,
acme
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
this.
i
might
add
that
the
representation
that
they
represented
other
firms
was
to
the
effect
that
they
represented
firms
in
other
non-competitive
lines
of
business.
and
since
it
was
in
non-competitive
lines
of
business,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
acme
to
inquire.
joshua
epstein
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
information
he
had,
he
did
no
consider
worthy
of
reliance
since
he
found
both
of
these
people
to
be
competent
employees.
and
as
the
district
court
found
in
the
criminal
prosecution
of
these
individuals,
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
in
which
acme
could
have
protected
itself.
when
you
have
employees
to
determine
--
to
defraud
their
employer
by
whatever
means
they
can
find
available.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
was
in
the
arrangement
with
acme
to
get
business
for
acme
and
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jack
rephan
for
14
months,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kickback
arrangements
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
was
an
entirely
different
issue.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
jack
rephan
no,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
think,
although
this
was
an
issue
before
the
court
of
claims,
i
believe
it
had
nothing
to
do
actually
with
the
kickback
arrangements.
this
was
something
which
was
apart
and
separate
and
involved
acme
in
its
subcontract
and
not
the
government
and
acme.
they
were
two
separate
issues
entirely.
in
fact
at
the
time
that
the
first
representation
was
made,
there
had
been
no
kickbacks.
so
obviously,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
that
point.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
consider
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
anti-kickback
act
back
in
the
1946.
at
that
time
most
of
the
defense
contracts
were
being
awarded
on
a
cost-plus
basis.
in
other
words,
the
contractor
would
perform
work
for
the
government
on
the
basis
of
being
paid
as
(inaudible)
cost
plus
maybe
a
fixed
fee
for
profit.
the
general
accounting
office
undercovered
that
there
were
kickbacks
such
as
gifts
being
paid
by
subcontractors
to
employees
of
a
prime
contract
to
--
or
which
in
turn
it
was
being
passed
on
to
the
government.
therefore
it
was
increasing
the
cost
of
the
government
and
the
government
obviously
was
getting
no
benefit
out
of
these
gratuities
being
paid
by
subcontractors
to
prime
contractors.
the
congress
in
its
committee
report
pointed
out
that
at
that
time,
it
was
extremely
doubtful
as
to
whether
there
was
any
way
the
government
could
sue
or
otherwise
recover
these
kickbacks.
and
this
is
the
clear
stated
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
act
to
prevent
the
government
from
bearing
the
cost
of
these
kickbacks
to
give
the
government
a
civil
remedy
to
sue
and
recover
back
the
kickbacks.
a
criminal
penalty
was
added
to
further
discourage
kickbacks.
the
act
as
it
was
originally
enacted
back
in
'46
applied
to
cost-plus
or
cost-reimbursible
type
contracts.
now,
acme's
contract
was
a
fixed-price
contract
although
the
price
could
be
renegotiated
within
some
very
narrow
limits
upward
and
downward.
it
was
because
of
the
type
of
contract
that
the
district
court
in
the
criminal
prosecution
of
norris
and
epstein
and
tucker
found
that
the
1946
act
did
not
apply
because
this
was
not
the
type
of
contract
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
enacted
the
1946
act.
judge
clark
in
the
criminal
case
recommended
that
the
attorney
general
propose
amendatory
legislation
to
congress
to
extend
the
application
of
the
act
to
cover
all
types
of
contract
such
as
the
acme
contract
and
this
was
the
reason
why
the
act
was
amended
in
1960
to
cover
all
negotiated
contracts.
there
was
a
decision
in
the
tenth
circuit,
the
barnard
case
which
the
government
of
course
relies
on
but
we
feel
it's
entirely
different.
there
was
a
fixed-price
contract
subject
to
renegotiation
but
there
was
no
limitation
on
the
amount
of
renegotiation
as
far
as
upward
or
downward
on
prices.
also,
there
was
a
cost-plus
facilities
contract
for
machinery
where
general
motors
was
a
prime
contractor.
so
the
barnard
case
we
submit
is
entirely
different
and
this
was
recognized
in
the
committee
reports
that
barnard
did
not
settle
this
question
and
it
was
for
that
purpose
in
1960
that
congress
said,
“we're
going
to
make
this
act
applicable
to
all
negotiated
contracts.”
the
act
was
unchanged
in
all
other
respects.
now
the
government
of
course
relies
heavily
on
the
dixon
and
yates
case.
dixon
and
yates
involved
a
criminal
statute.
we
have
a
criminal
statute
here
but
we
also
have
a
civil
statute,
a
statute
which
says
the
government
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
and
recover
the
kickbacks.
the
court
of
claims
held
as
one
of
their
reasons
for
rejecting
the
government's
defense
that
congress
by
enacting
a
specific
civil
remedy
precluded
any
other
remedy
if
one
exist
--
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
act.
of
course,
we
submit
also
and
i
think
the
court
of
claims
so
found
that
there
was
no
such
remedy
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
anti-kickback
acts
such
as
contract
cancellation.
dixon
and
yates
we
submit
is
entirely
different
for
this
reason.
in
dixon
and
yates,
we're
talking
about
a
contract
which
grew
out
of
an
illegal
transaction.in
fact,
the
court
in
dixon
and
yates
cited
two
cases,
miller
versus
ammon
and
bank
of
the
united
states
versus
owens,
to
the
effect
that
a
contract
is
not
to
be
enforced
when
it
arises
out
of
circumstances
that
would
lead
enforcement
to
defend
the
essential
purpose
of
the
enactment.
these
two
cases
were
entirely
different.
the
ammon
case
involved
a
contract
of
the
sale
of
wine
without
a
liquor
license,
obviously
an
illegal
contract.
the
bank
of
the
united
states
versus
owens
case
involved
a
suit
on
a
usurious
note.
again,
the
contract
here
was
illegal
ab
initio.
in
other
words
it
was
bored
form
the
beginning
because
of
the
illegality
attached
to
the
origination
of
the
contract.
in
dixon
and
yates,
the
violation
of
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
was
one
of
the
facts
that
led
to
the
award
of
the
contract,
had
it
not
been
for
mr.
winzel's
(ph)
activities
as
the
court
remarked,
perhaps
this
contract
would
never
have
been
awarded.
so
here
we
have
a
situation
where
a
contract
arises
from
or
grows
out
of
an
illegal
bargain,
a
violation
of
a
statute.
but
here
in
acme's
case,
we
had
no
such
thing.
there
was
no
violation
of
a
statute
in
the
award
of
acme's
contract.
the
anti-kickback
act
was
not
violated
in
the
award
of
acme's
contract.
if
there
was
any
violation
of
the
anti-kickback
act,
and
we
submit
there
was
not,
then
it
occurred
after
the
award
of
the
contract
to
acme.
if,
as
the
government
says
and
i
might
point
out
this
point
too,
that
in
the
government's
amended
answer,
that
is
their
answer
to
plaintiff's
third
amended
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
which
was
not
filed
until
1961,
should
--
having
been
filed
in
1957.
the
government
for
the
first
time
relied
specifically
on
the
anti-kickback
act,
in
there
it
was
the
1960
act.
now,
to
bring
the
case
anywhere
within
the
dixon
and
yates
case,
they
must
refer
to
the
criminal
section
of
the
anti-kickback
act
that
is
section
4
rather
than
the
civil
aspect
of
it
because
the
civil
aspect
merely
gives
a
right
to
sue
to
recover
back
the
kickbacks.
this
we
submit
is
not
only
manifestly
unfair
and
unjust
since
the
1960
amendment
resulted
from
this
very
contract
but
it
would
also
violate
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
ex
post
facto
laws,
they
would
be
relying
on
a
criminal
penalty
for
a
violation
of
an
act
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
alleged
violation
occurred
but
resulted
from
the
amendment
of
a
statute
which
occurred
some
seven
years
later.
also
--
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
might
point
out
on
the
davio
case,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
barrier
towards
applying
the
anti-kickback
act
retroactively
to
allow
the
government
to
sue.
we
say
now
to
allow
the
government
to
cancel
the
contract
under
these
circumstances
would
be
punitive
in
nature
and
that
would
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor,
that's
exactly
our
position.
they
could
not
lawfully
cancel
the
contract.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor,
they
have
the
right
to
withhold
payment
in
the
amount
of
the
kickbacks.
in
other
words,
to
the
prime
contractor,
when
they
pay
they
can
withhold
money
from
the
prime
contractors
so
that
the
government
would
not
bear
the
cost
of
the
kickbacks,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
act
says.
this
is
the
remedy
which
congress
gave
--
the
government
under
the
anti-kickback
act.
they
would
merely
withhold
sums
of
money
from
the
prime
contractor
and
--
or
they
could
bring
suit
against
the
subcontractor
or
the
prime
contractor;
or
the
prime
contractor
under
the
terms
of
the
act
could
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
the
government
against
the
subcontractor.
this
is
the
exact
remedy
which
--
mr.
jack
rephan
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
came
up
at
the
--
there
some
discussions
at
the
time
as
to
whether
--
in
fact
it
was
after
the
actual
cancellation
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
your
honor,
they
made
an
express
point
of
saying
under
no
circumstances
shall
the
contract
be
treated
as
a
term
“for
convenience.”
this
was
in
the
directive
of
the
department
of
army
at
the
time
the
contract
was
cancelled.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
white,
its
true
that
under
the
contract,
they
were
principles,
cost
principles
as
to
how
the
termination
cost
would
be
determined
if
the
government
invoked
the
termination
for
convenience
clause.
mr.
jack
rephan
the
commissioner
has
an
estimate
in
his
findings
of
fact
--
mr.
jack
rephan
--
of
approximately
$300,000.
mr.
jack
rephan
if
it
had
been
a
convenience
termination.
now,
the
plane
of
ex
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
i
think
this
really
involved
general
(inaudible)
in
the
discussions
with
g4
--
at
the
time
g4
considered
this
weapon
obsolete,
they
wanted
to
cancel
all
orders
for
the
seventy
five
millimeter
recoilless
rifle.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
and
the
government
said
--
in
fact,
the
plaintiffs'
position
in
the
court
below
was
that
the
reason
this
contract
was
really
cancelled
and
the
reason
the
government
really
threw
in
the
defenses
of
anti-kickback
was
to
save
itself
$300,000.
the
court
found
that
there
were
two
reasons
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
government
doesn't
want
to
pay
one
nickel,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
on
the
damage
question
which
i
am
about
to
reach,
your
honor,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
court
of
claims
adopted
an
erroneous
measure
of
damages,
under
the
commissioners'
findings,
the
contractor
is
entitled
approximately
$314,000.
this
--
mr.
jack
rephan
if
the
cancelling
--
lation
--
mr.
jack
rephan
was
wrongful.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
if
the
government
was
right,
of
course,
they
did
not
breach
the
contracts.
now,
if
they
were
right
of
course,
it
could
not
be
a
convenience
termination
but
we
submit
the
government
was
wrong
in
terminating
it.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
would
not
have
to
pay
--
mr.
jack
rephan
--
anything
if
the
--
if
we
sustained
the
government's
position.
mr.
jack
rephan
i
might
add
that
the
government
knew
about
these
kickback
acts,
the
alleged
violations
prior
to
the
time
the
contract
was
cancelled.
mr.
jack
rephan
approximately,
two
or
three
months?
mr.
jack
rephan
there's
a
finding
i
believe.
mr.
jack
rephan
the
substance
was
it
was
in
between
april
and
july
that
the
government
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
names
particularly
of
the
gun
engineering
transaction
between
norris
and
epstein
and
tucker
and
this
dummy
corporation
and
all
metals,
the
principal
subcontractor.
mr.
jack
rephan
approximately
three
months.
they
continued
to
investigate
at
the
time
of
cancellation.
the
cancellation
notice
said
statutory
violations
did
not
specify
the
anti-kickback
act.
it
did
not
specify
the
covenant
against
contingent
fees,
the
conflict
of
interest
statute.
it
merely
said
statutory
violations.
in
fact
it
was
not
made
known
until
act
--
until
about
1961
in
the
court
of
claims.
what
the
statutory
violations
were
upon
which
the
government
was
relying
and
this
was
despite
the
numerable
efforts
of
acme
to
find
out
what
violations
the
government
was
speaking
of.
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
restitution
issue,
if
i
may,
the
court
upon
the
plaintiffs'
argument
in
the
court
below
held
that
since
the
government
wrongfully
terminated
acme's
contract,
acme
was
entitled
to
sue
for
restitution
of
its
reasonable
cost
rather
than
sue
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
in
so
holding,
the
court
of
claims
recognized
that
restitution
was
an
all
--
an
agreed
remedy
for
a
breach
of
contract.
has
been
recognized
by
most
of
the
text
writers
and
by
the
majority
of
the
courts
in
this
country
for
many
years,
they
mentioned
carbon,
willistein
and
the
courts
of
the
various
states
which
said
that
where
the
breach
is
total,
that
is
where
one
party
prevents
the
other
party
from
going
ahead
with
performance,
that
the
party
may
forego
a
suit
for
damages
and
sue
for
the
reasonable
value
of
the
part
performance.
now,
they
said
also
that
the
contract
price
has
no
limitation
upon
the
value
of
the
services
performed
in
their
various
theories
set
forth
by
the
courts
for
this
holding.
one
of
them
is,
of
course,
that
the
breaching
party,
which
was
the
government
in
this
case,
has
put
the
contract
to
an
end.
so,
why
should
this
party
be
allowed
to
enforce
a
term
of
the
very
contract
which
it
says
has
ended
against
the
innocent
plaintiff?
in
other
words,
the
government
here
cancelled
the
contract
to
hold
the
plaintiff
to
the
contract
price
would
be
allowing
the
government
to
enforce
the
very
contract
which
it
has
breached.
another
reason
is
that
--
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
the
commissioner
as
far
as
damages
is
probably
adopted
the
correct
theory
since
it
was
shown
that
acme
could
have
reduced
its
losses,
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
unreimbursed
cost
as
of
the
date
of
the
breach.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
in
substance
the
total
would
be
less
cost
of
completion
or
loss
to
complete
the
contract.
now,
we
took
exception
of
course
to
the
amount
of
the
loss.
and
i
know
this
is
not
before
this
court
because
it's
a
factual
determination.
the
court
of
claims
made
no
finding
as
to
the
amount
of
the
money
which
acme
would
have
lost
had
they
been
allowed
to
complete
the
contracts.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
the
contract
price
for
the
rifles
which
had
been
delivered
had
been
paid
for.
now
we
have
other
costs,
for
instance
setting
up
the
plant
here
which
is
applicable
to
the
entire
contract
and
not
just
the
first
rifles
delivered.
so
we
have
never
been
paid
for
those
costs.
we
have
never
been
paid
for
overhead
for
the
entire
contract.
and
incidentally,
the
government
in
awarding
this
contract
was
vitally
interested
in
obtaining
another
source
of
supply;
there
was
only
one
manufacturer
of
this
rifle
in
the
country
at
that
time.
so
this
is
one
of
the
things
which
the
government
recognized.
i'm
sure
the
government
knew
this
bid
was
low.
and
acme
itself
admitted
it
was
a
low
bid.
but
again,
had
not
there
been
a
breach
of
contract,
a
cancellation,
the
relationship
would
have
continued,
so
undoubtedly
over
a
period
of
time,
the
government
would
have
benefited
and
acme
would've
benefited
too.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
obviously
not
because
the
findings
of
facts
make
it
clear
that
the
government
said
specifically
that
acme
was
never
considered
to
be
in
this
repute
in
government
circles.
it
was
never
criminally
violated.
in
fact
the
justice
department
said
they
recommended
no
criminal
or
civil
action
against
acme
and
this
was
five
or
six
years
after
the
cancellation
of
the
contract.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well
this
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
why
your
honor,
should
the
government
be
allowed
to
do
one
thing
and
then
when
it's
told
its
wrong
here,
they
go
by
retroactively
and
say,
“well,
now
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
--
terminate
it
for
convenience.”
in
other
words,
they
specifically
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
terminate
this
contract
for
the
convenience
government
specifically.”
now
then
this
would
be
saying,
“well,
they
we're
wrong
in
cancelling
it
for
anti-kickback
violations
so
now
we're
going
to
allow
them
to
treat
the
contract
as
having
been
cancelled.”
mr.
jack
rephan
it
was
approximately
the
same
under
the
commissioner's
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
this
raise
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
your
honor,
i
might
point
out
that
even
restitution
not
--
is
not
necessarily
more
here
because
the
court
says,
they're
reasonable
cost.
now
the
government
can
come
in
and
show
these
costs
were
excessive
so
it's
very
possible
that
even
restitution
could
be
less.
mr.
jack
rephan
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
they
merely
said
reasonable
cost
and
they
sent
it
back
to
the
commissioner
for
determination
as
to
what
cause
was
reasonable.
they
said,
“we'll
allow
the
government
to
bring
in
evidence
and
show
that
these
cost
were
excessive.”
so
that
they
have
not
specifically
awarded
a
judgment
in
a
monetary
amount.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
total
cost
were
six
hundred
and
some
odd
thousand
dollars.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
could
be
shaved
down.
in
fact
the
court
said,
“number
one
the
court
should
disallow
any
kickbacks.”
mr.
jack
rephan
of
course
it
goes
back
to
the
commissioner
who
made
the
initial
determination.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
we
submit
that
it's
grossly
unfair
for
the
government
to
say,
“we're
not
going
to
terminate
it.”
in
fact,
acme
was
in
asking
the
army,
“please,
treat
it
as
having
been
terminated
for
the
convenience
of
the
government."
they
said,
“we're
not
going
to
do
it.”
now
why
should
they
be
allowed
to
do
it
now
if
the
court
should
decide
that
they
were
wrong
in
cancelling
the
contract?
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
mister
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
initially
to
clear
out
some
of
the
factual
statements
because
i
think
the
facts
here
are
very
important.
most
importantly,
the
court
of
claims
found
as
a
fact
that
none
of
the
responsible
officials
of
acme
knew
anything
about
the
kickback
arrangements
until
after
the
cancellation
of
acme's
contract.
the
only
people
who
knew
about
these
kickback
arrangements
were
of
course
the
conspirators
themselves,
that
was
tucker
and
norris
and
jack
epstein.
now
norris
had
been
discharged
earlier
but
the
reason
norris
was
discharged
was
because
it
was
discovered
that
norris
had
charged
some
personal
farm
expenses
to
the
acme
contract
and
for
this
reason
he
was
fired.
at
this
point,
acme
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
kickback
arrangements.
mr.
jack
rephan
tucker's
--
mr.
jack
rephan
tucker
was
initially
hired
to
be
an
expediter
and
because
he
said
that
he
had
knowledge
in
the
field
of
government
contract
law
and
commercial
contracts
and
he
was
initially
retained
to
drum
up
business
generally
for
government
and
commercial
contracts
as
well.
mr.
jack
rephan
he
was
initially
on
a
commission
basis.
the
court
of
claims
didn't
directly
decide
there
was
a
violation
of
the
contingent
fee
covenant.
they
say
that
this
was
unnecessary
since
the
government
had
waited
fourteen
months
after
obtaining
knowledge
of
the
contract
with
tucker;
that
it
was
too
late
for
the
government
to
then
cancel
for
a
violation
of
the
contingent
fee
covenant.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
rephan
he
was
not
an
officer.
he
held
some
stock
but
it
was
non-voting
stock.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
at
that
time,
that's
true.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor
and
we
do
not
deny
that
he
was
an
employee.
as
to
whether
he
was
an
important,
there
was
some
dispute
about
this.
we
maintain
that
he
was
an
employee
but
he
was
not
a
major
employee.
of
course,
he
was
the
son
of
the
president
and
we
think
the
government
is
trying
to
make
quite
a
bit
out
of
this
but
we
think
it's
not
that
important
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
jack
rephan
there
were
several
statements,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
norris
was
given
the
authority
to
sign
contracts
initially.
most
of
them
were
signed
by
mr.
norris.
mr.
jack
rephan
to
sign
the
bids
initially.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
at
the
time
acme
hired
mr.
norris
and
mr.
tucker
--
of
course,
they
had
already
entered
into
agreements
with
the
others
--
some
of
the
other
subcontractors.
however,
acme
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
this.
i
might
add
that
the
representation
that
they
represented
other
firms
was
to
the
effect
that
they
represented
firms
in
other
non-competitive
lines
of
business.
and
since
it
was
in
non-competitive
lines
of
business,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
acme
to
inquire.
joshua
epstein
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
information
he
had,
he
did
no
consider
worthy
of
reliance
since
he
found
both
of
these
people
to
be
competent
employees.
and
as
the
district
court
found
in
the
criminal
prosecution
of
these
individuals,
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
in
which
acme
could
have
protected
itself.
when
you
have
employees
to
determine
--
to
defraud
their
employer
by
whatever
means
they
can
find
available.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
was
in
the
arrangement
with
acme
to
get
business
for
acme
and
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jack
rephan
for
14
months,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kickback
arrangements
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
was
an
entirely
different
issue.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
jack
rephan
no,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
think,
although
this
was
an
issue
before
the
court
of
claims,
i
believe
it
had
nothing
to
do
actually
with
the
kickback
arrangements.
this
was
something
which
was
apart
and
separate
and
involved
acme
in
its
subcontract
and
not
the
government
and
acme.
they
were
two
separate
issues
entirely.
in
fact
at
the
time
that
the
first
representation
was
made,
there
had
been
no
kickbacks.
so
obviously,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
that
point.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
consider
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
anti-kickback
act
back
in
the
1946.
at
that
time
most
of
the
defense
contracts
were
being
awarded
on
a
cost-plus
basis.
in
other
words,
the
contractor
would
perform
work
for
the
government
on
the
basis
of
being
paid
as
(inaudible)
cost
plus
maybe
a
fixed
fee
for
profit.
the
general
accounting
office
undercovered
that
there
were
kickbacks
such
as
gifts
being
paid
by
subcontractors
to
employees
of
a
prime
contract
to
--
or
which
in
turn
it
was
being
passed
on
to
the
government.
therefore
it
was
increasing
the
cost
of
the
government
and
the
government
obviously
was
getting
no
benefit
out
of
these
gratuities
being
paid
by
subcontractors
to
prime
contractors.
the
congress
in
its
committee
report
pointed
out
that
at
that
time,
it
was
extremely
doubtful
as
to
whether
there
was
any
way
the
government
could
sue
or
otherwise
recover
these
kickbacks.
and
this
is
the
clear
stated
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
act
to
prevent
the
government
from
bearing
the
cost
of
these
kickbacks
to
give
the
government
a
civil
remedy
to
sue
and
recover
back
the
kickbacks.
a
criminal
penalty
was
added
to
further
discourage
kickbacks.
the
act
as
it
was
originally
enacted
back
in
'46
applied
to
cost-plus
or
cost-reimbursible
type
contracts.
now,
acme's
contract
was
a
fixed-price
contract
although
the
price
could
be
renegotiated
within
some
very
narrow
limits
upward
and
downward.
it
was
because
of
the
type
of
contract
that
the
district
court
in
the
criminal
prosecution
of
norris
and
epstein
and
tucker
found
that
the
1946
act
did
not
apply
because
this
was
not
the
type
of
contract
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
enacted
the
1946
act.
judge
clark
in
the
criminal
case
recommended
that
the
attorney
general
propose
amendatory
legislation
to
congress
to
extend
the
application
of
the
act
to
cover
all
types
of
contract
such
as
the
acme
contract
and
this
was
the
reason
why
the
act
was
amended
in
1960
to
cover
all
negotiated
contracts.
there
was
a
decision
in
the
tenth
circuit,
the
barnard
case
which
the
government
of
course
relies
on
but
we
feel
it's
entirely
different.
there
was
a
fixed-price
contract
subject
to
renegotiation
but
there
was
no
limitation
on
the
amount
of
renegotiation
as
far
as
upward
or
downward
on
prices.
also,
there
was
a
cost-plus
facilities
contract
for
machinery
where
general
motors
was
a
prime
contractor.
so
the
barnard
case
we
submit
is
entirely
different
and
this
was
recognized
in
the
committee
reports
that
barnard
did
not
settle
this
question
and
it
was
for
that
purpose
in
1960
that
congress
said,
“we're
going
to
make
this
act
applicable
to
all
negotiated
contracts.”
the
act
was
unchanged
in
all
other
respects.
now
the
government
of
course
relies
heavily
on
the
dixon
and
yates
case.
dixon
and
yates
involved
a
criminal
statute.
we
have
a
criminal
statute
here
but
we
also
have
a
civil
statute,
a
statute
which
says
the
government
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
and
recover
the
kickbacks.
the
court
of
claims
held
as
one
of
their
reasons
for
rejecting
the
government's
defense
that
congress
by
enacting
a
specific
civil
remedy
precluded
any
other
remedy
if
one
exist
--
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
act.
of
course,
we
submit
also
and
i
think
the
court
of
claims
so
found
that
there
was
no
such
remedy
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
anti-kickback
acts
such
as
contract
cancellation.
dixon
and
yates
we
submit
is
entirely
different
for
this
reason.
in
dixon
and
yates,
we're
talking
about
a
contract
which
grew
out
of
an
illegal
transaction.in
fact,
the
court
in
dixon
and
yates
cited
two
cases,
miller
versus
ammon
and
bank
of
the
united
states
versus
owens,
to
the
effect
that
a
contract
is
not
to
be
enforced
when
it
arises
out
of
circumstances
that
would
lead
enforcement
to
defend
the
essential
purpose
of
the
enactment.
these
two
cases
were
entirely
different.
the
ammon
case
involved
a
contract
of
the
sale
of
wine
without
a
liquor
license,
obviously
an
illegal
contract.
the
bank
of
the
united
states
versus
owens
case
involved
a
suit
on
a
usurious
note.
again,
the
contract
here
was
illegal
ab
initio.
in
other
words
it
was
bored
form
the
beginning
because
of
the
illegality
attached
to
the
origination
of
the
contract.
in
dixon
and
yates,
the
violation
of
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
was
one
of
the
facts
that
led
to
the
award
of
the
contract,
had
it
not
been
for
mr.
winzel's
(ph)
activities
as
the
court
remarked,
perhaps
this
contract
would
never
have
been
awarded.
so
here
we
have
a
situation
where
a
contract
arises
from
or
grows
out
of
an
illegal
bargain,
a
violation
of
a
statute.
but
here
in
acme's
case,
we
had
no
such
thing.
there
was
no
violation
of
a
statute
in
the
award
of
acme's
contract.
the
anti-kickback
act
was
not
violated
in
the
award
of
acme's
contract.
if
there
was
any
violation
of
the
anti-kickback
act,
and
we
submit
there
was
not,
then
it
occurred
after
the
award
of
the
contract
to
acme.
if,
as
the
government
says
and
i
might
point
out
this
point
too,
that
in
the
government's
amended
answer,
that
is
their
answer
to
plaintiff's
third
amended
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
which
was
not
filed
until
1961,
should
--
having
been
filed
in
1957.
the
government
for
the
first
time
relied
specifically
on
the
anti-kickback
act,
in
there
it
was
the
1960
act.
now,
to
bring
the
case
anywhere
within
the
dixon
and
yates
case,
they
must
refer
to
the
criminal
section
of
the
anti-kickback
act
that
is
section
4
rather
than
the
civil
aspect
of
it
because
the
civil
aspect
merely
gives
a
right
to
sue
to
recover
back
the
kickbacks.
this
we
submit
is
not
only
manifestly
unfair
and
unjust
since
the
1960
amendment
resulted
from
this
very
contract
but
it
would
also
violate
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
ex
post
facto
laws,
they
would
be
relying
on
a
criminal
penalty
for
a
violation
of
an
act
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
alleged
violation
occurred
but
resulted
from
the
amendment
of
a
statute
which
occurred
some
seven
years
later.
also
--
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
might
point
out
on
the
davio
case,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
barrier
towards
applying
the
anti-kickback
act
retroactively
to
allow
the
government
to
sue.
we
say
now
to
allow
the
government
to
cancel
the
contract
under
these
circumstances
would
be
punitive
in
nature
and
that
would
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor,
that's
exactly
our
position.
they
could
not
lawfully
cancel
the
contract.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor,
they
have
the
right
to
withhold
payment
in
the
amount
of
the
kickbacks.
in
other
words,
to
the
prime
contractor,
when
they
pay
they
can
withhold
money
from
the
prime
contractors
so
that
the
government
would
not
bear
the
cost
of
the
kickbacks,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
act
says.
this
is
the
remedy
which
congress
gave
--
the
government
under
the
anti-kickback
act.
they
would
merely
withhold
sums
of
money
from
the
prime
contractor
and
--
or
they
could
bring
suit
against
the
subcontractor
or
the
prime
contractor;
or
the
prime
contractor
under
the
terms
of
the
act
could
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
the
government
against
the
subcontractor.
this
is
the
exact
remedy
which
--
mr.
jack
rephan
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
came
up
at
the
--
there
some
discussions
at
the
time
as
to
whether
--
in
fact
it
was
after
the
actual
cancellation
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
your
honor,
they
made
an
express
point
of
saying
under
no
circumstances
shall
the
contract
be
treated
as
a
term
“for
convenience.”
this
was
in
the
directive
of
the
department
of
army
at
the
time
the
contract
was
cancelled.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
white,
its
true
that
under
the
contract,
they
were
principles,
cost
principles
as
to
how
the
termination
cost
would
be
determined
if
the
government
invoked
the
termination
for
convenience
clause.
mr.
jack
rephan
the
commissioner
has
an
estimate
in
his
findings
of
fact
--
mr.
jack
rephan
--
of
approximately
$300,000.
mr.
jack
rephan
if
it
had
been
a
convenience
termination.
now,
the
plane
of
ex
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
i
think
this
really
involved
general
(inaudible)
in
the
discussions
with
g4
--
at
the
time
g4
considered
this
weapon
obsolete,
they
wanted
to
cancel
all
orders
for
the
seventy
five
millimeter
recoilless
rifle.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
and
the
government
said
--
in
fact,
the
plaintiffs'
position
in
the
court
below
was
that
the
reason
this
contract
was
really
cancelled
and
the
reason
the
government
really
threw
in
the
defenses
of
anti-kickback
was
to
save
itself
$300,000.
the
court
found
that
there
were
two
reasons
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
government
doesn't
want
to
pay
one
nickel,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
on
the
damage
question
which
i
am
about
to
reach,
your
honor,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
court
of
claims
adopted
an
erroneous
measure
of
damages,
under
the
commissioners'
findings,
the
contractor
is
entitled
approximately
$314,000.
this
--
mr.
jack
rephan
if
the
cancelling
--
lation
--
mr.
jack
rephan
was
wrongful.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
if
the
government
was
right,
of
course,
they
did
not
breach
the
contracts.
now,
if
they
were
right
of
course,
it
could
not
be
a
convenience
termination
but
we
submit
the
government
was
wrong
in
terminating
it.
mr.
jack
rephan
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
would
not
have
to
pay
--
mr.
jack
rephan
--
anything
if
the
--
if
we
sustained
the
government's
position.
mr.
jack
rephan
i
might
add
that
the
government
knew
about
these
kickback
acts,
the
alleged
violations
prior
to
the
time
the
contract
was
cancelled.
mr.
jack
rephan
approximately,
two
or
three
months?
mr.
jack
rephan
there's
a
finding
i
believe.
mr.
jack
rephan
the
substance
was
it
was
in
between
april
and
july
that
the
government
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
names
particularly
of
the
gun
engineering
transaction
between
norris
and
epstein
and
tucker
and
this
dummy
corporation
and
all
metals,
the
principal
subcontractor.
mr.
jack
rephan
approximately
three
months.
they
continued
to
investigate
at
the
time
of
cancellation.
the
cancellation
notice
said
statutory
violations
did
not
specify
the
anti-kickback
act.
it
did
not
specify
the
covenant
against
contingent
fees,
the
conflict
of
interest
statute.
it
merely
said
statutory
violations.
in
fact
it
was
not
made
known
until
act
--
until
about
1961
in
the
court
of
claims.
what
the
statutory
violations
were
upon
which
the
government
was
relying
and
this
was
despite
the
numerable
efforts
of
acme
to
find
out
what
violations
the
government
was
speaking
of.
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
restitution
issue,
if
i
may,
the
court
upon
the
plaintiffs'
argument
in
the
court
below
held
that
since
the
government
wrongfully
terminated
acme's
contract,
acme
was
entitled
to
sue
for
restitution
of
its
reasonable
cost
rather
than
sue
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
in
so
holding,
the
court
of
claims
recognized
that
restitution
was
an
all
--
an
agreed
remedy
for
a
breach
of
contract.
has
been
recognized
by
most
of
the
text
writers
and
by
the
majority
of
the
courts
in
this
country
for
many
years,
they
mentioned
carbon,
willistein
and
the
courts
of
the
various
states
which
said
that
where
the
breach
is
total,
that
is
where
one
party
prevents
the
other
party
from
going
ahead
with
performance,
that
the
party
may
forego
a
suit
for
damages
and
sue
for
the
reasonable
value
of
the
part
performance.
now,
they
said
also
that
the
contract
price
has
no
limitation
upon
the
value
of
the
services
performed
in
their
various
theories
set
forth
by
the
courts
for
this
holding.
one
of
them
is,
of
course,
that
the
breaching
party,
which
was
the
government
in
this
case,
has
put
the
contract
to
an
end.
so,
why
should
this
party
be
allowed
to
enforce
a
term
of
the
very
contract
which
it
says
has
ended
against
the
innocent
plaintiff?
in
other
words,
the
government
here
cancelled
the
contract
to
hold
the
plaintiff
to
the
contract
price
would
be
allowing
the
government
to
enforce
the
very
contract
which
it
has
breached.
another
reason
is
that
--
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
the
commissioner
as
far
as
damages
is
probably
adopted
the
correct
theory
since
it
was
shown
that
acme
could
have
reduced
its
losses,
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
unreimbursed
cost
as
of
the
date
of
the
breach.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
in
substance
the
total
would
be
less
cost
of
completion
or
loss
to
complete
the
contract.
now,
we
took
exception
of
course
to
the
amount
of
the
loss.
and
i
know
this
is
not
before
this
court
because
it's
a
factual
determination.
the
court
of
claims
made
no
finding
as
to
the
amount
of
the
money
which
acme
would
have
lost
had
they
been
allowed
to
complete
the
contracts.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
the
contract
price
for
the
rifles
which
had
been
delivered
had
been
paid
for.
now
we
have
other
costs,
for
instance
setting
up
the
plant
here
which
is
applicable
to
the
entire
contract
and
not
just
the
first
rifles
delivered.
so
we
have
never
been
paid
for
those
costs.
we
have
never
been
paid
for
overhead
for
the
entire
contract.
and
incidentally,
the
government
in
awarding
this
contract
was
vitally
interested
in
obtaining
another
source
of
supply;
there
was
only
one
manufacturer
of
this
rifle
in
the
country
at
that
time.
so
this
is
one
of
the
things
which
the
government
recognized.
i'm
sure
the
government
knew
this
bid
was
low.
and
acme
itself
admitted
it
was
a
low
bid.
but
again,
had
not
there
been
a
breach
of
contract,
a
cancellation,
the
relationship
would
have
continued,
so
undoubtedly
over
a
period
of
time,
the
government
would
have
benefited
and
acme
would've
benefited
too.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
obviously
not
because
the
findings
of
facts
make
it
clear
that
the
government
said
specifically
that
acme
was
never
considered
to
be
in
this
repute
in
government
circles.
it
was
never
criminally
violated.
in
fact
the
justice
department
said
they
recommended
no
criminal
or
civil
action
against
acme
and
this
was
five
or
six
years
after
the
cancellation
of
the
contract.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well
this
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
why
your
honor,
should
the
government
be
allowed
to
do
one
thing
and
then
when
it's
told
its
wrong
here,
they
go
by
retroactively
and
say,
“well,
now
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
--
terminate
it
for
convenience.”
in
other
words,
they
specifically
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
terminate
this
contract
for
the
convenience
government
specifically.”
now
then
this
would
be
saying,
“well,
they
we're
wrong
in
cancelling
it
for
anti-kickback
violations
so
now
we're
going
to
allow
them
to
treat
the
contract
as
having
been
cancelled.”
mr.
jack
rephan
it
was
approximately
the
same
under
the
commissioner's
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
this
raise
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
your
honor,
i
might
point
out
that
even
restitution
not
--
is
not
necessarily
more
here
because
the
court
says,
they're
reasonable
cost.
now
the
government
can
come
in
and
show
these
costs
were
excessive
so
it's
very
possible
that
even
restitution
could
be
less.
mr.
jack
rephan
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
they
merely
said
reasonable
cost
and
they
sent
it
back
to
the
commissioner
for
determination
as
to
what
cause
was
reasonable.
they
said,
“we'll
allow
the
government
to
bring
in
evidence
and
show
that
these
cost
were
excessive.”
so
that
they
have
not
specifically
awarded
a
judgment
in
a
monetary
amount.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
total
cost
were
six
hundred
and
some
odd
thousand
dollars.
mr.
jack
rephan
this
could
be
shaved
down.
in
fact
the
court
said,
“number
one
the
court
should
disallow
any
kickbacks.”
mr.
jack
rephan
of
course
it
goes
back
to
the
commissioner
who
made
the
initial
determination.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
we
submit
that
it's
grossly
unfair
for
the
government
to
say,
“we're
not
going
to
terminate
it.”
in
fact,
acme
was
in
asking
the
army,
“please,
treat
it
as
having
been
terminated
for
the
convenience
of
the
government."
they
said,
“we're
not
going
to
do
it.”
now
why
should
they
be
allowed
to
do
it
now
if
the
court
should
decide
that
they
were
wrong
in
cancelling
the
contract?
thank
you,
your
honor.
