justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
had
--
in
which
a
--
and
those
people
didn't
--
it
could
be
that
all,
to
the
making
of
the
contract
with
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
--
to
agree
with
you,
don't
we
have
to
hold
of
the
--
that
the
old
--
that
of
--
that
the
old
kickback
statute
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
it
was
just
but
then
that's
what
the
holding
at
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
this
whole
kickback
statute
didn't
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
you
contend
the
new
con
--
the
new
statute
should
be
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
new
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
these
events
took
place
before
the
new
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
the
--
that
either
the
old
or
the
new
kickback
statute
is
any
help
to
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
remedy
or
common
law
for
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
wholly
--
this
is
you're
wholly
--
relying
on
those
two
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
dixon
and
yates
at
least
held
that
there
was
a
specific
federal
statute
that
was
violated
there,
namely
the
conflict
of
interest
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
--
and
so
consequently,
do
you
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
specific
statute
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
statutes,
you're
out
of
court,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
there
was
a
denial
--
even
if
there
was
a
violation
the
old
anti-kickback
statute,
you
still
have
to
go
on
and
show
or
argue
that
the
remedy
provided
by
the
statute
has
to
be
supplemented
by
the
right
of
cancellation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
do
you
get
that
kind
of
a
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
so
you
say
there
is
a
judge-made
law
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
right
of
cancellation
protecting
kickbacks?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they
--
could
get
the
kickback
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
could,
why
couldn't
you
have
cancelled
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
it
have
to
pay,
mr.
solicitor
general,
to
cancel
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
restitution
is
limited
by
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
you're
saying
that
you
can't
recover
any
more
than
you
could
in
a
suit
for
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
ever
--
what
--
then
what
is
the
restitution
ever
amount
to
if
it's
just
another
damages
with
another
label
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
government
cancels
the
contract
wrongfully,
acme
could
sue
and
ask
for
damages
or
specific
performance
and
at
least
they
could
get
--
they
probably
couldn't
recover
from
the
government
a
nickel,
could
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
get
--
could
they
make
the
rest
of
the
rifles
and
both
the
government
would
take
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
had
have
to
make
the
rifles
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
didn't
make
the
rifles
and
deliver
them,
they
could
recover
nothing,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
337?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
government
ever
assert
the
right
to
cancel
for
some
convenience?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i'll
put
it
this
way,
why
has
the
government
precluded
that
this
point
from
saying
this
cancellation
is
for
the
convenience
of
the
government
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
--
would
there
been
some
principles
of
which
were
applicable
then
to
determine
the
amount
that
the
government
would
have
to
pay
if
it
were
a
cancellation?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
has
anybody
has
--
is
there
any
way
of
figuring
out
at
this
point
or
knowing
from
this
record
what
--
how
much
it
would've
had
--
been
had
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
had
been
a
convenience?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wasn't
the
government
--
did
not
specify,
do
you
know
why
the
government
specified
this
should
not
be
considered
a
cancellation
for
convenience?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
--
it's
the
difference
between
paying
nothing
and
$300,000,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
really
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
doesn't
want
to
pay
anything
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
its
position
is
upheld
across
the
board,
they
won't
pay
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
that's
only
if
the
cancellation
was
wrongful.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
cancellation
was
wrongful.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
they
were
right
in
doing
it,
the
government
doesn't
pay
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
a
moment
you
had
sued
for
damages,
acme
had
sued
for
damages
for
a
breach
of
contract,
what
would
you
have
recovered?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
$314,000.00?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
had
sued
for
damages,
you
would've
been
starting
out
--
configuring
from
the
contract
price
for
these
rifles?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
--
if
the
government
had
said,
“we
cancelled
the
contract,
one
because
of
the
anti-kickback
act
--
activities
here;
or
two,
if
that
doesn't
stick
for
our
convenience,
under
the
contract.”
then
if
the
kickback
cancellation
having
split
up,
they
--
the
government
would
have
been
remitted
to
the
cancellation
for
convenience.
now
why
shouldn't
it
be
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
the
government
disclaimed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
all
you've
agreed
in
the
way
the
contract
is
written
to
let
the
government
walk
away
from
the
contractor
a
certain
amount
of
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
possible
that
the
cancellation
for
convenience
to
the
government
might
give
you
more
than
the
simple
--
than
ordinary
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
this
might
give
you
a
little
bit
more
and
what
if
we
held
that
that
giving
--
that
giving
restitution
was
going
too
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
should
you
rather
have
--
which
would
you
rather
have,
damages
or
cancellation
for
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
the
court
of
claims
has
already
adjudged
what
it's
going
to
be,
what
you're
going
to
recover
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
likely
to
be
shaved
down
to
$314,000,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
either
one
of
you
would
be
up
here
instead
of
the
shaved
down
readily?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
lose
on
that,
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
we
just
--
what
if
your
--
what
if
you
just
lose

just
plainly
lose
on
that
