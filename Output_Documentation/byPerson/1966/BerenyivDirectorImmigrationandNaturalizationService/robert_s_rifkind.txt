mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
dr.
berenyi's
petition
for
naturalization
was
denied
because
he
was
found
that
he
had
given
false
testimony
in
his
naturalization
proceedings.
under
section
101
(f)
(6)
of
the
act,
that
finding
precluded
the
determination
of
good
moral
character
which
is
you
know
is
a
pre-requisite
for
naturalization.
let
me
emphasize
especially
in
the
light
of
the
proceeding
argument
that
the
petition
was
not
denied
because
of
any
judgment
one
way
or
the
other,
as
to
petitioner's
attachment
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
or
his
disposition
to
the
good
order
and
happiness
of
the
united
states.
nor
are
we
in
any
way
concerned
here
with
petitioner's
political,
economic
or
social
opinions,
nor
with
his
loyalty
or
allegiance.
and
i
would
also
like
to
express
it,
this
--
at
the
outset
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
naturalization
is
denied
because
of
events
long
ago
or
far
away.
the
petition
was
not
denied
because
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
hungarian
communist
party
nor
if
it
is
anything
else
that
the
petitioner
did
in
hungary.
indeed,
the
district
court
held
that
the
petition
could
not
be
denied
under
section
313
of
the
act
which
precludes
the
naturalization
of
persons
who
have
been
voluntary
members
of
communist
party
within
the
last
ten
years.
because
the
evidence
here
did
not
show
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
within
that
ten-year
period.
it
is
perfectly
clear
therefore,
that
the
petition
was
not
denied
because
of
petition's
--
petitioner's
past
membership
but
solely
because
the
district
court
found
from
the
evidence,
the
petitioner
had
testified
falsely
in
denying
such
membership.
the
petitioner's
principle
attack
on
the
judgment
below
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
he
based
it
on
what
--
i
will
show
in
just
a
moment
mr.
chief
justice
is,
unnecessary
resolution
of
a
conflict
in
testimony
against
the
party
bearing
the
burden
of
persuasion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
--
as
have
been
pointed
out,
two
witnesses.
i
certainly
agree
that
this
was
not
the
strongest
conceivable
evidence.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
as
insubstantial
as
petitioner
has
said.
first
of
all,
dr.
kury,
who
had
been
a
classmate
of
petitioner
testified
that
petitioner
said
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
he
had
joined
the
party
when
the
russians
moved
in.
i
know
of
no
rule
of
evidence
that
cast
aspersions
on
admissions.
indeed,
an
admission
is
normally
regarded
as
very
good
evidence,
short
of
being
able
to
subpoena
the
records
of
a
hungarian
communist
party.
dr.
berenyi's
own
statement
yet
it
credited
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
seems
to
me
evidence
that's
entitled
to
some
attention
into
some
way.
i
agree
that
there
are
problems
with
admissions
but
dr.
berenyi
was
free
to
explain
his
prior
statement
if
it
was
misunderstood
or
misinterpreted,
if
it
was
said
in
jest.
if
he
was
qualified,
he
was
free
to
qualify
it.
he
was
free
to
impeach
the
witness.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
quite
so.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
all
i
can
say
is,
having
said
it
didn't
happen
we're
concerned
with
an
event
in
the
past
as
we
are
so
often
in
litigation.
did
he
say
it
or
didn't
he
say
it?
and
the
judge
had
the
task.
i
think
the
inescapable
task
of
deciding
which
witness
he
chose
to
believe.
now,
dr.
kury's
testimony
was
corroborated
in
some
measure
at
least
by
that
of
dr.
halasz,
who
had
been
a
student
a
few
years
junior
to
petitioner.
and
i
think
if
apparent
--
i
you
examine
the
record
that
dr.
halasz
was
an
extremely
circumspect
witness
and
he
was
eager
i
think,
did
he
said
so?
not
to
endure
a
colleague
for
whom
he
had
great
esteem,
and
his
testimony
is
undoubtedly
equivocal
in
many
respects.
he
nevertheless
testified
that
he
had
seen
petitioner
at
party
meetings
at
most
of
which
only
party
members
were
present.
now
i
refer
you
to
page
267
and
268
of
the
record.
question:
in
other
words,
while
you
were
both
going
to
medical
school,
both
you
and
he
attended
communist
party
functions
at
which
only
communist
party
members
could
be
present?
answer:
yes.
and
on
page
268,
we're
you
and
he
actually
at
communist
party
functions
where
the
participants
were
actually
communist
party
members
with
no
noncommunist
present?
yes
sir,
on
many
occasions.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
he
said
that
he
was
in
a
unit
that
attended
soldiers
who
had
--
who
were
in
fact
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
a
doctor.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
but
my
understanding
is
the
hospital
took
in
whatever
soldiers
happened
to
be
falling
and
the
ones
around
them
were
falling
on
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
dare
say
it.
i
think
i
must
say,
i
think
that
the
judge's
finding
as
to
what
he
did
during
the
hungarian
uprising
wholly
irrelevant.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
review
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
at
the
district
court
level.
the
naturalization
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
really
not
well-versed
in
that
there
is
some
--
there
was
a
good
deal
of
attention
paid
to
this
man.
i
know,
over
a
number
of
years,
what
prompted
the
decisions
below
is,
i
just
don't
know.
there
were
of
course
a
very
large
number
of
refugees
who
came
over
all
at
once
and
they
didn't,
going
through
those
records
ever
since
i
suppose.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
mean
to
say
that
they
did
examine
a
great
many
witnesses
on
--
not
all
of
whose
testimonies
in
the
record
but
i
don't
--
certainly
don't
care
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right,
as
for
this
court's
determination.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
if
i
may
by
trying
to
answer
two
questions,
which
i
did
an
inadequate
job
with
yesterday.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked,
first
of
all
concerning
the
review
provided
like
it
within
the
service
and
within
the
justice
department
of
hearing
examiner
determinations
in
these
matters.
limiting
myself
to
naturalization
proceedings,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
procedure
for
review
within
the
immigration
service.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
hearing
examiner's
determination
was
reviewed
in
that
district
office
and
then
by
a
regional
commissioner.
there
is
no
provision
for
--
and
more
general
review
outside
the
service
except
as
to
peculiar
or
particular
rulings
of
law
which
might
come
from
the
office
of
legal
counsel.
i
did
point
out
that
section
335
(d)
of
the
act
provide
that
in
all
events
even
if
disapproved
by
a
superiors,
the
hearing
examiner's
report
was
go
to
the
district
judge.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
district
judge
in
any
sense
and
as
the
district
judge
here
said,
he
disregarded
both
the
findings
and
these
--
and
the
conclusions
of
law
completely.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
not
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
only
two
conceivable
grounds
for
deportation.
one
is
that
he
was
at
some
time
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
other
is
that
he
gave
false
testimonies.
as
to
the
former,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
government's
own
evidence
showed
that
his
membership
was
not
of
the
meaningful
variety
that
would
serve
as
a
basis
for
deportation
and
probably
wasn't
even
of
this
sort
of
the
voluntary
variety
that
would
serve
as
a
basis
for
exclusion.
as
to
the
misrepresentation,
he
would
of
course
have
the
benefit
of
section
241
(f)
which
forgives
that
sort
of
thing,
you
have
that
before
you
in
the
erika
case.
so
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
deportation
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
certainly
not.
indeed,
he
is
now
entitled
to
apply
as
the
spouse
of
an
american
citizen
since
his
wife
was
admitted
to
citizenship.
the
period
involved
there
is
a
three-year
period
after
her
admission.
they
need
only
show
good
moral
character
for
that
three-year
period
and
his
time
in
that
regard
would
be
up
in
about
15
months
from
now.
so
it's
a
very
short-term
proposition.
one
other
thing
i
might
mention
also
bearing
on
this
general
problem
of
review
within
the
justice
department
and
the
immigration
service
is
that
about
a
hundred
thousand
persons
are
naturalized
each
year,
at
least
that
was
the
figure
in
the
last
report
of
the
attorney
general
for
60
--
1965.
of
those
petitions
were
withdrawn
and
some
1800
cases
and
there
was
a
litigated
question
and
some
150
questions
--
cases.
so
that
there's
quite
a
substantial
problem
as
far
as
reviewing
the
details
of
each
cases
in
administrative
manner.
i
also
think
that
those
figures
tend
to
stress
the
importance
of
the
system
of
self-disclosure
of
self-reporting
that
the
immigration
law
depends
on.
it's
rather
like
the
internal
revenue
law
in
many
senses.
it
is
largely
the
initial
application
that
the
petitioner
files
in
which
he
answers
a
variety
of
questions
which
were
designed
by
regulations,
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
to
issue
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
petitioner
had
certainly
urged
that
--
your
decisions
in
rowoldt
and
in
the
gastelum
cases
concerning
a
meaningful
association
--
meaningfulness
of
association
i
should
say
are
controlling
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
that
is
the
standard,
i
think
we
should
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
degree
of
his
membership,
the
intensity
of
his
fidelity
or
his
loyalty
to
that
cause
is
quite
decide
the
point
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
there
are
two
things.
one
is
--
in
this
particular
case,
he
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
said
to
other
people
in
hungary
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
in
lessons
--
there
are
some
substantial
doubt
cast
on
that
sort
of
admission.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
right.
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me
also,
just
to
add
to
that
in
a
way
and
to
try
and
refine
what
our
position
is,
it
is
not
contended
by
any
means
that
he
was
a
believer
in
any
of
the
principles
of
the
party.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
we
could
not
because
as
dr.halasz
testified
against
him
kept
saying,
“i
think
he
was
a
member
on
paper.
i
don't
think
he
was
a
believer.
i
don't
think
he
was
a
member
in
his
heart,
but
i
think
he
was
a
member
of
the
party.”
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
supposed
that
under
proper
--
under
--
i
don't
want
to
resist
you.
but
--
that
on
this
coercive
circumstances,
i
could
be
an
instructor
and
practically
anything
i
could
bone
up
on
and
still
not
have
my
heart
in
it.
our
position
is
as
i
see
it
and
i
think
it
emerges
with
some
strength
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
perhaps
we
do
satisfy
the
rowoldt
test
but
my
--
i
think
it's
important
for
the
administration
of
this
law
for
me
to
suggest
that
we
needn't
satisfy
the
rowoldt
test.
because
in
rowoldt
after
all
and
in
the
gastelum
case,
you
were
construing
statutory
language
of
section
241
of
the
act,
you
were
trying
to
determine
what
sort
of
membership
congress
had
intended
should
bear
certain
consequences.
here,
we're
not
concerned
with
statutory
language,
we're
concerned
with
a
search
for
information
whereas
the
--
concerned
with
an
examiner's
questions.
questions
which
i
have
no
doubt
the
examiner
had
a
right
to
put
and
ought
to
have
put
under
the
circumstances
of
qualifications
for
citizenship.
it
was
information
that
the
petitioner
was
obliged
to
supply.
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
congress
intended
in
using
the
word
membership.
after
all,
petitioner
was
asked
some
seven
times
over
a
period
of
several
years,
whether
under
any
circumstances
at
any
place
he
had
in
any
way
been
affiliated
with
or
a
member
of,
directly
or
indirectly
--
any
communist
party.
and
he
said,
“no.”
he
didn't
say,
“no,
but,”
or
“no,
except,”
or
“yes,
except.”
he
didn't
say,
“yes,
but
i
wasn't
an
active
member,”
or
“yes,
but
i
was
not
a
nominal
member.”
he
said,
“no.”
and
i
think
--
although
he
was
advised
by
counsel
at
that
time
and
he
was
told
that
there
was
evidence
the
contrary
for
him
to
now
come
and
say,
if
he
does
and
i
admit
it
but
arguendo
in
the
hypothetical
for
him
to
now
come
and
say,
“yes,
i
was
a
member
but
i
was
not
a
meaningful
member
or
an
active
member.”
is
--
it
seems
to
me
to
admit
that
he's
been
engaging
in
a
deception
all
these
years.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
arguendo
then
on
the
pieces
of
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
insofar
as
his
alternate
argument
is
--
well,
even
if
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
i
wasn't
a
meaningful
member.
i
don't
think
that
squares
with
the
sort
of
answers
he's
been
given
to
searching
questions
over
a
period
of
years.
we
certainly
agree
or
we
agree
arguendo
at
least
with
the
petitioner
that
if
his
naturalization
had
been
barred
under
section
313
because
of
his
party
membership,
that
the
rowoldt
test
and
the
gastelum
test
of
meaningfulness
might
be
appropriate.
but
it
wasn't
denied
for
that
reason.
it
couldn't
have
been
denied
for
that
reason
if
the
district
judge
found.
it
was
denied
purely
because
he
was
found
that
he
wasn't
telling
the
truth.
and
it
is
the
truthfulness
of
his
testimony
or
the
untruthfulness
of
his
testimony
that
is
critical
here,
not
the
meaningfulness
of
his
membership.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
as
far
as
i
know
he
did
go
to
a
lawyer
and
he
did
have
counsel,
and
i
don't
know.
perhaps
he
feared
or
perhaps
he
knew
that
the
facts
were
other
than
those
that
the
district
judge
finally
came
down
on.
that
is
perhaps
he
had
been
a
member
within
the
last
ten
years.
and
feared
that
we
would
prove
more
than
--
we
succeeded
in
proving
or
perhaps
his
membership
--
he
feared
would
be
have
shown
to
be
more
active.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
that
he
--
that
the
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
that
it
was
immaterial
--
that
there
was
a
bar
to
his
naturalization
in
his
membership
in
order
to
show
that
he
testified
falsely
in
concealing
that
matter
and
this
court
has
said
that
on
many
occasions.
the
trial
courts
have
too
before
101
was
--
section
101
was
passed,
this
court
said
in
federal
communications
at
woko.
it's
the
fact
of
concealment
that
is
more
significant
that
the
facts
concealed.
it's
the
willingness
to
deceive
a
government
agency
that
in
this
case
bears
on
good
moral
character.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
he
was.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
varied
from
time
to
time.
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
there
was
a
substantial
contradictional
or
there
was
some
minor
contradictions.
he
said
he
participated
in
--
in
general,
in
group
discussion
that
all
students
were
required
to
participate
in.
that
is
that
the
study
of
lenninism
became
a
required
subject
at
the
university
under
communist
rule
and
that
he
engaged
in
that
sort
of
discussion.
but
he
denied
participation
in
the
sorts
of
discussions
that
either
dr.
halasz
or
dr.
kury
placed
in
it.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
not
to
my
knowledge.
both
of
them
i
should
say
where
naturalized
citizens
at
the
time
that
all
this
took
place.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
could
be,
i
don't
--
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
have.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i've
seen
nothing
in
either
the
record
here
or
any
place
else
to
suggest
that.
one
had
been
a
communist
admittedly
and
the
other
had
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
looked
beyond
this
record
to
the
administrative
record,
i've
seen
nothing
to
suggest
that.
to
go
back
to
the
clearly
erroneous
argument
in
the
minute
remaining,
i
tried
to
show
yesterday
that
there
was
a
sharp
conflict
of
testimony
but
the
judge
was
faced
with
the
task
of
weighing
the
evidence
one
way
or
the
other,
an
inescapable
task,
i
submit
it
was.
this
court
has
said
that
at
trial
court's
choice
between
two
permissible
views
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
cannot
be
clearly
erroneous.
i
think
that's
through
a
fortiori
when
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
conceitedly
on
the
petitioner.
he
had
to
resolve
a
long
line
of
decisions
in
this
court,
indeed
the
act
say,
he
had
to
resolve
doubts
that
he
may
have
had
against
the
petitioner.
i
also
think
it's
important
that
particularly
with
witnesses
who's
--
were
relative
newcomers
to
the
english
language
that
the
trial
judge
had
a
very
superior
opportunity
to
see
all
the
witnesses
in
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
cold
record
and
i
think
the
mandate
of
rule
52
of
the
deference
due
to
the
opportunity
of
the
trial
judge
to
assess
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
is
particularly
important
where
credibility
is
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case.
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
understood
the
petitioner
to
say
yesterday
and
i
certainly
agree
with
him
that
the
ultimate
issue
of
course
is
good
moral
character.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
in
this
--
this
--
the
question
immediately
under
that
is
whether
he's
been
telling
the
truth,
we
as
bearing
on
good
moral
character.
the
government
--
he
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
truthfulness
and
good
moral
character
and
submitting
his
petition
through
affidavits.
the
government
then
supplied
some
evidence
when
forward
with
the
evidence
calling
that
into
question.
it
was
then
his
burden
as
i
understand
it,
to
still
show
that
he
was
of
truthful
character,
good
moral
character.
and
he
had
to
overcome
the
evidence
that
the
government
presented
and
persuade
the
court
that
he
wasn't
back
a
truthful
witness.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
does
in
this
case
or
to
--
yes,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
and
that
would
be
true
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
section
101.
it
also
provides
that
a
person
who's
been
a
habitual
drunkard
cannot
be
found
to
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it,
the
government
supply
some
evidence
raising
a
question
as
to
whether
a
person
is
a
--
or
tending
to
show
that
a
person
is
a
habitual
drunkard.
he
would
have
a
burden
of
showing
that
he
wasn't.
because
the
ultimate
issue
is
good
moral
character
and
on
that
issue,
there's
no
question,
he
must
establish
his
case.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
agree.
i
agree
it's
hard.
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
think
it's
difficult
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
is
a
heavy
burden,
proving
that
you're
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
maybe
difficult.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
one
would
really
go
about
doing
that
but
it's
required,
proving
that
one
as
well
disposed
to
the
happiness
of
the
united
states
maybe
difficult.
i
don't
know
how
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
if
the
government
brought
forward
evidence
to
--
supplied
evidence
to
seriously
call
that
into
question,
that
is
right.
at
least
so,
all
the
cases
i've
read
suggest,
and
as
long
as
we
are
going
to
have
a
very
strict
rule,
a
very
limited
rule
for
denaturalization.
that
is
as
long
as
our
doubts
are
going
to
be
resolved
very
strictly
against
the
government
and
only
in
various
extraordinary
cases
you're
going
to
allow
denaturalization,
which
i
think
is
the
--
clearly,
healthy
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
traditional
view
and
the
statutory
view
the
doubts
are
to
be
resolved
against
the
petitioner
on
the
naturalization
side
is
a
desirable
logical
relationship.
i
agree
it's
difficult.
i
would
only
whined
up
by
saying
as
this
board
has
said,
acquisition
of
american
citizenship
is
a
solemn
affair.
full
and
truthful
response
to
all
relevant
questions
required
by
naturalization
procedures
of
course
to
be
exacted
and
temporizing
with
the
truth
must
be
vigorously
discouraged.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
the
real
--
the
essence
of
the
impression
that
a
reasonable
trier
of
fact
could
draw
from
dr.
halasz
in
which
i
do
is
that
granted
and
admitting
quite
readily
that
he
didn't
see
the
petitioner
take
the
party
membership
oath
that
there
is
such
or
(inaudible),
didn't
see
his
party
card.
he
nevertheless
saw
him
under
circumstance
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
i
think
frankly
that
all
of
the
things
that
you've
just
read
from
tend
to
support
the
credibility
of
that
witness,
tends
to
support
the
thesis
that
that
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
party
as
a
matter
of
opportunistic
convenience
without
any
other
form
of
attachment.
but
that
those
around
him
and
those
who
knew
him
believed
him
to
be
--
from
the
reasonable
surrounding
circumstances
in
fact
a
member
of
the
party.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
dr.
berenyi's
petition
for
naturalization
was
denied
because
he
was
found
that
he
had
given
false
testimony
in
his
naturalization
proceedings.
under
section
101
(f)
(6)
of
the
act,
that
finding
precluded
the
determination
of
good
moral
character
which
is
you
know
is
a
pre-requisite
for
naturalization.
let
me
emphasize
especially
in
the
light
of
the
proceeding
argument
that
the
petition
was
not
denied
because
of
any
judgment
one
way
or
the
other,
as
to
petitioner's
attachment
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
or
his
disposition
to
the
good
order
and
happiness
of
the
united
states.
nor
are
we
in
any
way
concerned
here
with
petitioner's
political,
economic
or
social
opinions,
nor
with
his
loyalty
or
allegiance.
and
i
would
also
like
to
express
it,
this
--
at
the
outset
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
naturalization
is
denied
because
of
events
long
ago
or
far
away.
the
petition
was
not
denied
because
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
hungarian
communist
party
nor
if
it
is
anything
else
that
the
petitioner
did
in
hungary.
indeed,
the
district
court
held
that
the
petition
could
not
be
denied
under
section
313
of
the
act
which
precludes
the
naturalization
of
persons
who
have
been
voluntary
members
of
communist
party
within
the
last
ten
years.
because
the
evidence
here
did
not
show
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
within
that
ten-year
period.
it
is
perfectly
clear
therefore,
that
the
petition
was
not
denied
because
of
petition's
--
petitioner's
past
membership
but
solely
because
the
district
court
found
from
the
evidence,
the
petitioner
had
testified
falsely
in
denying
such
membership.
the
petitioner's
principle
attack
on
the
judgment
below
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
he
based
it
on
what
--
i
will
show
in
just
a
moment
mr.
chief
justice
is,
unnecessary
resolution
of
a
conflict
in
testimony
against
the
party
bearing
the
burden
of
persuasion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
--
as
have
been
pointed
out,
two
witnesses.
i
certainly
agree
that
this
was
not
the
strongest
conceivable
evidence.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
as
insubstantial
as
petitioner
has
said.
first
of
all,
dr.
kury,
who
had
been
a
classmate
of
petitioner
testified
that
petitioner
said
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
he
had
joined
the
party
when
the
russians
moved
in.
i
know
of
no
rule
of
evidence
that
cast
aspersions
on
admissions.
indeed,
an
admission
is
normally
regarded
as
very
good
evidence,
short
of
being
able
to
subpoena
the
records
of
a
hungarian
communist
party.
dr.
berenyi's
own
statement
yet
it
credited
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
seems
to
me
evidence
that's
entitled
to
some
attention
into
some
way.
i
agree
that
there
are
problems
with
admissions
but
dr.
berenyi
was
free
to
explain
his
prior
statement
if
it
was
misunderstood
or
misinterpreted,
if
it
was
said
in
jest.
if
he
was
qualified,
he
was
free
to
qualify
it.
he
was
free
to
impeach
the
witness.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
quite
so.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
all
i
can
say
is,
having
said
it
didn't
happen
we're
concerned
with
an
event
in
the
past
as
we
are
so
often
in
litigation.
did
he
say
it
or
didn't
he
say
it?
and
the
judge
had
the
task.
i
think
the
inescapable
task
of
deciding
which
witness
he
chose
to
believe.
now,
dr.
kury's
testimony
was
corroborated
in
some
measure
at
least
by
that
of
dr.
halasz,
who
had
been
a
student
a
few
years
junior
to
petitioner.
and
i
think
if
apparent
--
i
you
examine
the
record
that
dr.
halasz
was
an
extremely
circumspect
witness
and
he
was
eager
i
think,
did
he
said
so?
not
to
endure
a
colleague
for
whom
he
had
great
esteem,
and
his
testimony
is
undoubtedly
equivocal
in
many
respects.
he
nevertheless
testified
that
he
had
seen
petitioner
at
party
meetings
at
most
of
which
only
party
members
were
present.
now
i
refer
you
to
page
267
and
268
of
the
record.
question:
in
other
words,
while
you
were
both
going
to
medical
school,
both
you
and
he
attended
communist
party
functions
at
which
only
communist
party
members
could
be
present?
answer:
yes.
and
on
page
268,
we're
you
and
he
actually
at
communist
party
functions
where
the
participants
were
actually
communist
party
members
with
no
noncommunist
present?
yes
sir,
on
many
occasions.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
he
said
that
he
was
in
a
unit
that
attended
soldiers
who
had
--
who
were
in
fact
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
a
doctor.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
but
my
understanding
is
the
hospital
took
in
whatever
soldiers
happened
to
be
falling
and
the
ones
around
them
were
falling
on
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
dare
say
it.
i
think
i
must
say,
i
think
that
the
judge's
finding
as
to
what
he
did
during
the
hungarian
uprising
wholly
irrelevant.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
review
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
at
the
district
court
level.
the
naturalization
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
really
not
well-versed
in
that
there
is
some
--
there
was
a
good
deal
of
attention
paid
to
this
man.
i
know,
over
a
number
of
years,
what
prompted
the
decisions
below
is,
i
just
don't
know.
there
were
of
course
a
very
large
number
of
refugees
who
came
over
all
at
once
and
they
didn't,
going
through
those
records
ever
since
i
suppose.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
mean
to
say
that
they
did
examine
a
great
many
witnesses
on
--
not
all
of
whose
testimonies
in
the
record
but
i
don't
--
certainly
don't
care
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right,
as
for
this
court's
determination.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
if
i
may
by
trying
to
answer
two
questions,
which
i
did
an
inadequate
job
with
yesterday.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked,
first
of
all
concerning
the
review
provided
like
it
within
the
service
and
within
the
justice
department
of
hearing
examiner
determinations
in
these
matters.
limiting
myself
to
naturalization
proceedings,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
procedure
for
review
within
the
immigration
service.
in
this
case
for
example,
the
hearing
examiner's
determination
was
reviewed
in
that
district
office
and
then
by
a
regional
commissioner.
there
is
no
provision
for
--
and
more
general
review
outside
the
service
except
as
to
peculiar
or
particular
rulings
of
law
which
might
come
from
the
office
of
legal
counsel.
i
did
point
out
that
section
335
(d)
of
the
act
provide
that
in
all
events
even
if
disapproved
by
a
superiors,
the
hearing
examiner's
report
was
go
to
the
district
judge.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
district
judge
in
any
sense
and
as
the
district
judge
here
said,
he
disregarded
both
the
findings
and
these
--
and
the
conclusions
of
law
completely.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
not
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
only
two
conceivable
grounds
for
deportation.
one
is
that
he
was
at
some
time
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
other
is
that
he
gave
false
testimonies.
as
to
the
former,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
government's
own
evidence
showed
that
his
membership
was
not
of
the
meaningful
variety
that
would
serve
as
a
basis
for
deportation
and
probably
wasn't
even
of
this
sort
of
the
voluntary
variety
that
would
serve
as
a
basis
for
exclusion.
as
to
the
misrepresentation,
he
would
of
course
have
the
benefit
of
section
241
(f)
which
forgives
that
sort
of
thing,
you
have
that
before
you
in
the
erika
case.
so
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
deportation
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
certainly
not.
indeed,
he
is
now
entitled
to
apply
as
the
spouse
of
an
american
citizen
since
his
wife
was
admitted
to
citizenship.
the
period
involved
there
is
a
three-year
period
after
her
admission.
they
need
only
show
good
moral
character
for
that
three-year
period
and
his
time
in
that
regard
would
be
up
in
about
15
months
from
now.
so
it's
a
very
short-term
proposition.
one
other
thing
i
might
mention
also
bearing
on
this
general
problem
of
review
within
the
justice
department
and
the
immigration
service
is
that
about
a
hundred
thousand
persons
are
naturalized
each
year,
at
least
that
was
the
figure
in
the
last
report
of
the
attorney
general
for
60
--
1965.
of
those
petitions
were
withdrawn
and
some
1800
cases
and
there
was
a
litigated
question
and
some
150
questions
--
cases.
so
that
there's
quite
a
substantial
problem
as
far
as
reviewing
the
details
of
each
cases
in
administrative
manner.
i
also
think
that
those
figures
tend
to
stress
the
importance
of
the
system
of
self-disclosure
of
self-reporting
that
the
immigration
law
depends
on.
it's
rather
like
the
internal
revenue
law
in
many
senses.
it
is
largely
the
initial
application
that
the
petitioner
files
in
which
he
answers
a
variety
of
questions
which
were
designed
by
regulations,
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
to
issue
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
petitioner
had
certainly
urged
that
--
your
decisions
in
rowoldt
and
in
the
gastelum
cases
concerning
a
meaningful
association
--
meaningfulness
of
association
i
should
say
are
controlling
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
that
is
the
standard,
i
think
we
should
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
degree
of
his
membership,
the
intensity
of
his
fidelity
or
his
loyalty
to
that
cause
is
quite
decide
the
point
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
there
are
two
things.
one
is
--
in
this
particular
case,
he
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
said
to
other
people
in
hungary
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
in
lessons
--
there
are
some
substantial
doubt
cast
on
that
sort
of
admission.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
right.
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me
also,
just
to
add
to
that
in
a
way
and
to
try
and
refine
what
our
position
is,
it
is
not
contended
by
any
means
that
he
was
a
believer
in
any
of
the
principles
of
the
party.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
we
could
not
because
as
dr.halasz
testified
against
him
kept
saying,
“i
think
he
was
a
member
on
paper.
i
don't
think
he
was
a
believer.
i
don't
think
he
was
a
member
in
his
heart,
but
i
think
he
was
a
member
of
the
party.”
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
supposed
that
under
proper
--
under
--
i
don't
want
to
resist
you.
but
--
that
on
this
coercive
circumstances,
i
could
be
an
instructor
and
practically
anything
i
could
bone
up
on
and
still
not
have
my
heart
in
it.
our
position
is
as
i
see
it
and
i
think
it
emerges
with
some
strength
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
perhaps
we
do
satisfy
the
rowoldt
test
but
my
--
i
think
it's
important
for
the
administration
of
this
law
for
me
to
suggest
that
we
needn't
satisfy
the
rowoldt
test.
because
in
rowoldt
after
all
and
in
the
gastelum
case,
you
were
construing
statutory
language
of
section
241
of
the
act,
you
were
trying
to
determine
what
sort
of
membership
congress
had
intended
should
bear
certain
consequences.
here,
we're
not
concerned
with
statutory
language,
we're
concerned
with
a
search
for
information
whereas
the
--
concerned
with
an
examiner's
questions.
questions
which
i
have
no
doubt
the
examiner
had
a
right
to
put
and
ought
to
have
put
under
the
circumstances
of
qualifications
for
citizenship.
it
was
information
that
the
petitioner
was
obliged
to
supply.
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
congress
intended
in
using
the
word
membership.
after
all,
petitioner
was
asked
some
seven
times
over
a
period
of
several
years,
whether
under
any
circumstances
at
any
place
he
had
in
any
way
been
affiliated
with
or
a
member
of,
directly
or
indirectly
--
any
communist
party.
and
he
said,
“no.”
he
didn't
say,
“no,
but,”
or
“no,
except,”
or
“yes,
except.”
he
didn't
say,
“yes,
but
i
wasn't
an
active
member,”
or
“yes,
but
i
was
not
a
nominal
member.”
he
said,
“no.”
and
i
think
--
although
he
was
advised
by
counsel
at
that
time
and
he
was
told
that
there
was
evidence
the
contrary
for
him
to
now
come
and
say,
if
he
does
and
i
admit
it
but
arguendo
in
the
hypothetical
for
him
to
now
come
and
say,
“yes,
i
was
a
member
but
i
was
not
a
meaningful
member
or
an
active
member.”
is
--
it
seems
to
me
to
admit
that
he's
been
engaging
in
a
deception
all
these
years.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
arguendo
then
on
the
pieces
of
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
insofar
as
his
alternate
argument
is
--
well,
even
if
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
i
wasn't
a
meaningful
member.
i
don't
think
that
squares
with
the
sort
of
answers
he's
been
given
to
searching
questions
over
a
period
of
years.
we
certainly
agree
or
we
agree
arguendo
at
least
with
the
petitioner
that
if
his
naturalization
had
been
barred
under
section
313
because
of
his
party
membership,
that
the
rowoldt
test
and
the
gastelum
test
of
meaningfulness
might
be
appropriate.
but
it
wasn't
denied
for
that
reason.
it
couldn't
have
been
denied
for
that
reason
if
the
district
judge
found.
it
was
denied
purely
because
he
was
found
that
he
wasn't
telling
the
truth.
and
it
is
the
truthfulness
of
his
testimony
or
the
untruthfulness
of
his
testimony
that
is
critical
here,
not
the
meaningfulness
of
his
membership.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
as
far
as
i
know
he
did
go
to
a
lawyer
and
he
did
have
counsel,
and
i
don't
know.
perhaps
he
feared
or
perhaps
he
knew
that
the
facts
were
other
than
those
that
the
district
judge
finally
came
down
on.
that
is
perhaps
he
had
been
a
member
within
the
last
ten
years.
and
feared
that
we
would
prove
more
than
--
we
succeeded
in
proving
or
perhaps
his
membership
--
he
feared
would
be
have
shown
to
be
more
active.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
that
he
--
that
the
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
that
it
was
immaterial
--
that
there
was
a
bar
to
his
naturalization
in
his
membership
in
order
to
show
that
he
testified
falsely
in
concealing
that
matter
and
this
court
has
said
that
on
many
occasions.
the
trial
courts
have
too
before
101
was
--
section
101
was
passed,
this
court
said
in
federal
communications
at
woko.
it's
the
fact
of
concealment
that
is
more
significant
that
the
facts
concealed.
it's
the
willingness
to
deceive
a
government
agency
that
in
this
case
bears
on
good
moral
character.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
he
was.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
varied
from
time
to
time.
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
there
was
a
substantial
contradictional
or
there
was
some
minor
contradictions.
he
said
he
participated
in
--
in
general,
in
group
discussion
that
all
students
were
required
to
participate
in.
that
is
that
the
study
of
lenninism
became
a
required
subject
at
the
university
under
communist
rule
and
that
he
engaged
in
that
sort
of
discussion.
but
he
denied
participation
in
the
sorts
of
discussions
that
either
dr.
halasz
or
dr.
kury
placed
in
it.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
not
to
my
knowledge.
both
of
them
i
should
say
where
naturalized
citizens
at
the
time
that
all
this
took
place.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
could
be,
i
don't
--
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
have.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i've
seen
nothing
in
either
the
record
here
or
any
place
else
to
suggest
that.
one
had
been
a
communist
admittedly
and
the
other
had
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
looked
beyond
this
record
to
the
administrative
record,
i've
seen
nothing
to
suggest
that.
to
go
back
to
the
clearly
erroneous
argument
in
the
minute
remaining,
i
tried
to
show
yesterday
that
there
was
a
sharp
conflict
of
testimony
but
the
judge
was
faced
with
the
task
of
weighing
the
evidence
one
way
or
the
other,
an
inescapable
task,
i
submit
it
was.
this
court
has
said
that
at
trial
court's
choice
between
two
permissible
views
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
cannot
be
clearly
erroneous.
i
think
that's
through
a
fortiori
when
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
conceitedly
on
the
petitioner.
he
had
to
resolve
a
long
line
of
decisions
in
this
court,
indeed
the
act
say,
he
had
to
resolve
doubts
that
he
may
have
had
against
the
petitioner.
i
also
think
it's
important
that
particularly
with
witnesses
who's
--
were
relative
newcomers
to
the
english
language
that
the
trial
judge
had
a
very
superior
opportunity
to
see
all
the
witnesses
in
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
cold
record
and
i
think
the
mandate
of
rule
52
of
the
deference
due
to
the
opportunity
of
the
trial
judge
to
assess
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
is
particularly
important
where
credibility
is
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case.
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
understood
the
petitioner
to
say
yesterday
and
i
certainly
agree
with
him
that
the
ultimate
issue
of
course
is
good
moral
character.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
in
this
--
this
--
the
question
immediately
under
that
is
whether
he's
been
telling
the
truth,
we
as
bearing
on
good
moral
character.
the
government
--
he
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
truthfulness
and
good
moral
character
and
submitting
his
petition
through
affidavits.
the
government
then
supplied
some
evidence
when
forward
with
the
evidence
calling
that
into
question.
it
was
then
his
burden
as
i
understand
it,
to
still
show
that
he
was
of
truthful
character,
good
moral
character.
and
he
had
to
overcome
the
evidence
that
the
government
presented
and
persuade
the
court
that
he
wasn't
back
a
truthful
witness.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
does
in
this
case
or
to
--
yes,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
and
that
would
be
true
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
section
101.
it
also
provides
that
a
person
who's
been
a
habitual
drunkard
cannot
be
found
to
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it,
the
government
supply
some
evidence
raising
a
question
as
to
whether
a
person
is
a
--
or
tending
to
show
that
a
person
is
a
habitual
drunkard.
he
would
have
a
burden
of
showing
that
he
wasn't.
because
the
ultimate
issue
is
good
moral
character
and
on
that
issue,
there's
no
question,
he
must
establish
his
case.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
agree.
i
agree
it's
hard.
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
think
it's
difficult
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
is
a
heavy
burden,
proving
that
you're
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
maybe
difficult.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
one
would
really
go
about
doing
that
but
it's
required,
proving
that
one
as
well
disposed
to
the
happiness
of
the
united
states
maybe
difficult.
i
don't
know
how
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
if
the
government
brought
forward
evidence
to
--
supplied
evidence
to
seriously
call
that
into
question,
that
is
right.
at
least
so,
all
the
cases
i've
read
suggest,
and
as
long
as
we
are
going
to
have
a
very
strict
rule,
a
very
limited
rule
for
denaturalization.
that
is
as
long
as
our
doubts
are
going
to
be
resolved
very
strictly
against
the
government
and
only
in
various
extraordinary
cases
you're
going
to
allow
denaturalization,
which
i
think
is
the
--
clearly,
healthy
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
traditional
view
and
the
statutory
view
the
doubts
are
to
be
resolved
against
the
petitioner
on
the
naturalization
side
is
a
desirable
logical
relationship.
i
agree
it's
difficult.
i
would
only
whined
up
by
saying
as
this
board
has
said,
acquisition
of
american
citizenship
is
a
solemn
affair.
full
and
truthful
response
to
all
relevant
questions
required
by
naturalization
procedures
of
course
to
be
exacted
and
temporizing
with
the
truth
must
be
vigorously
discouraged.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
the
real
--
the
essence
of
the
impression
that
a
reasonable
trier
of
fact
could
draw
from
dr.
halasz
in
which
i
do
is
that
granted
and
admitting
quite
readily
that
he
didn't
see
the
petitioner
take
the
party
membership
oath
that
there
is
such
or
(inaudible),
didn't
see
his
party
card.
he
nevertheless
saw
him
under
circumstance
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
i
think
frankly
that
all
of
the
things
that
you've
just
read
from
tend
to
support
the
credibility
of
that
witness,
tends
to
support
the
thesis
that
that
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
party
as
a
matter
of
opportunistic
convenience
without
any
other
form
of
attachment.
but
that
those
around
him
and
those
who
knew
him
believed
him
to
be
--
from
the
reasonable
surrounding
circumstances
in
fact
a
member
of
the
party.
