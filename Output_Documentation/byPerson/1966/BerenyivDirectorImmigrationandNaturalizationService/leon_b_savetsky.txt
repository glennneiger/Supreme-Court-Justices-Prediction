mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
naturalization
based
upon
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
hungary.
and
that
in
denying
such
membership
and
testimony
before
the
immigration
service
on
his
naturalization
application,
he
does
gave
false
testimony
in
order
to
obtain
a
benefit
under
the
act,
the
benefit
of
naturalization.
now
as
thus
by
statutory
definition
precluded
from
being
a
person
of
good
moral
character
under
the
provisions
of
section
101
(f)
(6)
of
the
act,
the
requirement
of
good
moral
character
of
course
a
pre-requisite
to
naturalization
under
section
316
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
this
petitioner
has
never
admitted
any
communist
body
membership.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
denied
that
steadfastly
throughout.
and
as
a
result,
it
is
the
finding
of
communist
party
membership
by
the
district
court
upon
which
the
decision
in
this
case
hinges
for
as
the
government
appears
to
agree
at
page
17
of
its
brief,
once
the
finding
of
past
membership
was
made,
the
finding
of
false
testimony
inevitably
file
there
from.
and
conversely,
without
the
finding
of
such
membership,
the
finding
of
false
testimony
could
not
have
been
made.
now
the
--
a
brief
background
of
this
case
is
as
follows.
the
petitioner
is
a
hungarian
national,
a
medical
doctor,
who
together
with
his
wife
fled
hungary
in
november
of
1956,
a
few
days
after,
the
uprising
was
crushed.
at
that
time
together
with
thousands
of
other
people,
they
escaped
across
the
border
into
austria.
and
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
were
in
the
following
month,
december
of
1956,
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
permanent
residents.
in
january
of
1962,
after
the
lapse
of
the
five-year
statutory
residence
period,
both
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
filed
a
petition
for
naturalization.
and
after
an
extended
preliminary
investigation
and
examination,
the
designated
naturalization
examiner
in
october
of
1964
denied
--
or
pardon
me,
recommended
the
denial
of
both
petitions
upon
the
following
grounds.
with
respect
to
the
petitioner,
a
denial
was
recommended
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
within
the
ten
years
proceeding
the
filing
of
the
petition
and
his
membership
does
--
rendered
him
ineligible
for
citizenship
under
the
provisions
of
section
313
of
the
act.
those
provisions
which
born
naturalization
to
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
proscribed
organization
listed
therein.
and
the
second
ground
upon
which
denial
was
recommended
was
that
during
the
period
to
which
petitioner
was
required
to
establish
good
moral
conduct,
the
five
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition,
he
had
therefore
testified
falsely
as
to
such
communist
party
membership
in
hungary
in
order
to
facilitate
his
naturalization
and
was
therefore
by
statutory
definition
rendered
ineligible
to
be
found
to
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
incidentally,
the
wife's
petition
was
recommended
to
be
denied
on
the
ground
that
she
too
had
testified
falsely
before
the
immigration
service,
in
denying
her
husband's
communist
party
membership
and
that
she
was
therefore
precluded
from
being
deemed
a
person
of
good
moral
character
under
101
(f)
(6)
of
the
act.
both
petitioner
and
his
wife
requested
a
hearing
in
open
court
as
is
their
right
under
the
statute.
and
the
final
hearing
was
a
joint
hearing
on
both
petitions
in
the
district
court.
and
on
that
final
hearing,
the
government
produced
two
witnesses.
both
of
whom
were
hungarian
nationals
and
who
had
attended
medical
school
at
the
university
of
budapest
during
portions
of
the
time
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
medical
student
there.
the
petitioner
had
attended
medical
school
there
from
1946
to
1952,
it
was
a
six-year
course
he
graduated
in
1952.
at
that
time
by
the
way,
the
medical
classes
at
the
university
of
budapest
averaged
approximately
five
to
600
students
in
each
year.
now
the
government's
principal
witness
of
dr.
kury,
testified
that
he
had
entered
medical
school
in
1948,
the
same
year
as
the
petitioner,
but
that
for
the
first
two
years
he
had
have
no
contact
with
the
petitioner.
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
in
september
of
1948,
kury
testified
that
he
was
assigned
to
a
small
study
group
of
about
20
or
so
students
that
was
scheduled
to
meet
regularly
every
afternoon.
the
primary
purpose
of
these
study
groups
was
to
enable
the
students
to
discuss
and
review
on
a
more
intimate
and
closer
level
the
medical
subjects
that
they
had
been
taught
in
the
large
lecture
groups
of
several
hundred
students
earlier
in
the
day,
and
which
by
the
very
nature
of
the
size
of
this
classes
precluded
any
sort
of
informal
exchange
of
ideas.
the
medical
subjects
discussed
in
these
groups
was
under
the
leadership
of
an
upper
classmen,
a
medical
student
from
a
higher
grade.
in
addition,
in
as
much
as
the
communist
where
at
this
time
the
dominant
political
party
in
the
government
and
were
also
in
control
of
the
school
administration.
these
study
groups
were
also
required
to
discuss
the
principles
of
marxism-leninism,
and
this
aspect
of
their
activity
was
to
be
under
the
direction
of
another
student
within
the
group,
that
is
a
student
other
than
this
leader
of
the
medical
studies.
now
it's
kury's
testimony
that
he
attended
only
the
first
meeting
of
the
study
group
in
september
of
1948.
and
on
that
occasion,
there
were
about
20
or
so
students
in
attendance
of
whom
the
petitioner
was
one.
and
at
this
meeting,
each
of
the
students
was
asked
to
make
a
few
preliminary
background
remarks
about
himself
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
himself
to
the
rest
of
the
group.
and
kury
stated
that
when
it
came,
the
petitioner's
turn
to
introduce
himself
to
the
group,
the
petitioner
stated
to
the
group
that
he
was
the
person
who
was
in-charged
of
the
ideological
education
of
the
group.
kury
further
states
that
the
petitioner
also
said
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
had
joined
the
communist
party
in
1945
after
soviet
troops
had
occupied
hungary
and
that
he
further
told
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
group
that
they
should
read
certain
soviet
books,
should
see
soviet
films
and
discuss
the
news
among
themselves.
he
said
that
on
this
occasion,
petitioner
spoke
for
about
five
minutes,
did
not
asked
anybody
to
join
the
party
or
just
--
try
to
get
anybody
recruited
into
the
party.
now
after
the
first
meeting
of
this
study
group
in
september
of
1948,
kury
transferred
out
of
this
group
to
another
group
and
never
had
any
more
dealings
with
the
petitioner.
so
that
this
alleged
statement
of
the
petitioner
or
perhaps
five
minutes
duration,
made
more
than
16
years
prior
to
the
final
hearing
in
the
district
court
was
in
fact
the
court's
sole
basis
for
its
finding
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
hungary.
there
was
another
government
witness,
a
dr.
halasz.
but
halasz's
testimony
turned
up
to
be
in
fact
more
favorable
to
the
petitioner
than
it
was
to
the
government.
halasz
entered
medical
school
in
1949,
three
years
after
the
petitioner,
and
had
been
friendly
with
him
and
as
much
they
live
in
the
same
dormitory.
and
halasz
himself
was
admittedly
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
testified
the
communist
party
meetings
were
held
of
about
once
a
month
in
the
medical
school
and
that
he
attended
some
but
not
all
of
them.
at
first,
he
testified
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
at
perhaps
two
or
three
meetings
but
that
--
i'm
sorry
--
at
first,
he
testified
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
at
several
meetings
in
1950
or
'51.
but
when
pressed,
he
stated
that
it
might
have
been
two
or
three
meetings
and
perhaps
maybe
it
was
only
meeting
at
which
he
saw
the
petitioner.
he
did
not
recall
whether
any
of
these
meetings
were
open
or
closed.
he
stated
that
nonmembers
of
the
party
were
many
times
invited
to
attend
such
meetings
and
such
invitation
was
tantamount
to
an
order,
that
disobeyal
of
which
subjected
the
person
for
severe
penalties
which
might
possibly
include
expulsion
from
the
school.
he
also
stated
that
nonmembers
were
not
necessarily
identified
as
such
at
these
meetings.
the
petitioner
in
halasz's
words
was
a
brilliant
and
outstanding
medical
student
whom
the
communists
would
naturally
have
tried
to
indoctrinate
in
communism
and
would
have
invited
therefore
to
attend
these
meetings.
halasz,
the
admitted
member
of
the
party,
never
saw
any
membership
card
or
membership
book
of
the
petitioner
on
any
occasion,
though
on
some
occasions
he
was
the
doorkeeper
in-charge
of
staying
at
the
door,
checking
the
credentials
of
people
who
came
in.
he
never
saw
the
petitioner
pay
any
dues.
he
never
saw
the
petitioner's
name
on
any
party
list.
he
never
observed
the
petitioner
vote
and
he
never
saw
or
at
least
did
not
recall
ever
hearing
the
petitioner
say
anything
at
any
such
meeting.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
halasz
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
he
actually
did
not
know
whether
the
petitioner
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
that
he
had
at
one
time
made
that
assumption
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
him
at
these
meetings
or
meeting.
but
again
he
stated
that
he
did
not
recall
whether
any
such
meeting
was
open
or
closed
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
private
conversations
he
had
with
the
petitioner
at
that
time
and
as
much
as
they
were
close
friends,
he
knew
the
petitioner
to
be
quite
anticommunist
in
his
views.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
kury's
testimony,
well
kury
apparently
could
recite
this
incident
of
more
than
16
years
previously
without
too
much
difficulty.
he
could
hardly
remember
anything
else
which
transpired
at
this
one
meeting.
he
could
not
remember
who
the
medical
group
leader
of
the
studies
was.
he
could
not
remember
the
name
of
any
of
the
other
students
in
the
group.
he
could
not
admittedly
remember
the
exact
words
that
were
used
or
allegedly
used
by
the
petitioner
on
this
occasion.
he
had
never
made
any
notes
or
kept
any
diary
with
respect
to
it.
and
this
meeting
was
conceitedly
not
a
communist
party
meeting,
this
was
a
meeting
of
students
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
studies.
therefore,
based
upon
solely
the
testimony
of
kury,
the
district
court
made
its
findings
in
which
it
seem
to
have
embraced
kury's
testimony
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else.
because
of
the
time
situation,
i
am
not
going
at
length
into
the
positive
evidence
educed
in
support
of
the
petition
for
naturalization
which
i
might
say
was
quite
substantial,
but
i
am
dealing
with
that
aspect
of
the
evidence
which
was
damaging
and
which
the
court
embraced
in
making
its
findings.
the
court
didn't
make
the
following
findings,
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1945
or
rather
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1945,
the
same
year
that
russian
troops
occupied
the
country.
this
last
phrase
is
a
verbatim
quote
from
this
finding.
it
indicates
an
adoption
of
kury's
language
verbatim
even
though
this
witness
did
not
profess
to
give
the
exact
words
that
had
been
used
by
the
petitioner
on
this
occasion.
the
court
next
said
that
the
petitioner
remained
a
member
of
the
party
for
an
indefinite
number
of
years.
here,
the
district
court
differed
with
the
naturalization
examiner's
findings
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
within
the
proscribe
ten-year
period
was
therefore
currently
ineligible
under
section
313.
but
then
as
much
as
there
was
no
testimony
in
the
record
to
indicate
any
landfall
of
duration
of
membership,
the
court
instead
characterized
the
duration
of
the
petitioner's
membership
and
its
finding
of
fact
as
an
indefinite
number
of
years.
it
then
found
that
the
petitioner
attended
closed
meetings
of
the
party.
on
this,
there
was
no
testimony
at
all
to
justify
this
finding.
the
only
witness
who
testified
as
to
any
meetings
was
halasz.
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
could
not
recall
whether
any
meeting
at
which
he
saw
the
petitioner
was
open
or
closed.
this
seems
to
have
been
a
gratuitous
finding
on
the
part
of
the
court.
the
next
finding
that
petitioner
was
in-charge
of
instruction
in
communist
ideology
at
student
study
groups
for
an
undetermined
period
of
time.
this
again
is
based
solely
upon
the
alleged
statement
which
kury
attributes
to
the
petitioner.
it
was
absolutely
no
independent
evidence
at
all
of
the
petitioner
having
engaged
in
any
such
activities
as
the
statement
allegedly
--
as
the
finding
allegedly
describes
or
have
often
having
engaged
in
any
activities
of
the
communist
party,
there
is
only
the
statement,
the
extrajudicial
admission
that
is
attributed
to
him
by
the
witness
kury.
lastly,
the
court
found
that
the
petitioner
did
not
participate
in
the
hungarian
revolt.
he
made
this
--
the
district
court
made
this
as
an
affirmative
finding.
not
only
was
there
no
evidence
on
this
at
all.
but
on
the
contrary,
the
only
evidence
with
respect
to
this
point
was
the
petitioner's
testimony
in
which
he
stated
that
is
army
unit
fought
against
the
russians
during
the
hungarian
uprising,
and
that
during
the
revolt,
he
was
continually
on
duty
in
the
hospital
treating
the
wounded.
based
upon
the
finding
of
past
communist
party
membership,
the
district
court
there
found
that
the
petitioner
had
caused
testified
falsely
and
he
was
statutorily
excluded
from
becoming
naturalized
--
statutory
excluded
from
being
a
person
of
good
moral
character
as
would
permit
his
naturalization.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
no,
sir.
the
wife
was
granted
her
citizenship
--
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
point
in
a
moment.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
i
did
not
mean
to
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
--
fend
off
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
the
wife
--
well
if
i
may,
the
--
this
--
the
appellate
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
affirmed,
they
affirmed
unanimously.
they
held
that
while
the
petitioner
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
good
moral
character.
this
merely
imposed
the
burden
of
going
fall
out
of
producing
evidence
on
the
government.
and
they
then
said,
that
the
district
court's
belief
of
the
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
adequately
satisfied
the
burden
of
the
government
in
going
forward
and
that
giving
due
weight
to
the
opportunity
of
the
trial
court
to
observe
the
conduct
and
demeanor
of
witnesses,
it
could
not
say
that
the
trial
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
getting
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
wife's
petition,
the
district
court
granted
the
wife's
petition.
and
they
granted
the
wife's
petition
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
same
witnesses
whose
credibility
they
apparently
approved
off
with
respect
to
the
wife
who
are
the
same
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
this
was
a
joint
hearing.
there
is
no
mentioned
by
the
way
in
the
record
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
in
anyway
cast
any
reflection
upon
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
witnesses
were
i
think
persons
of
established
reputation
in
the
community.
one
was
a
doctor
on
the
staff
of
temple
university
who
had
been
on
the
staff
of
this
medical
school
of
the
university
of
budapest
that
are
about
the
same
time
the
petitioner
was
there.
another
one
was
an
engineer
who
had
known
the
petitioner
in
hungary
at
or
about
the
time
in
question
here
and
who
himself
was
an
avowed
anticommunist
to
the
extent
but
he
was
imprisoned
--
arrested
twice,
imprisoned
once
and
exiled
once
for
his
anticommunist
activities.
this
man
stood
up
and
vouched
for
the
petitioner's
anticommunist
views.
and
views
that
had
been
expressed
at
or
about
the
time
in
question
back
in
hungary.
he
also
produced
the
lady
with
whom
he
and
his
wife
had
lived
shortly
after
their
marriage
in
1952
until
the
time
they
all
fled
together
in
1956,
this
lady
was
the
aunt
of
the
wife.
and
he
also
produced
among
his
other
witnesses,
the
mother
of
the
wife.
the
mother
of
the
wife
had
left
hungary
with
her
husband
and
two
younger
children
some
time
previously
because
of
the
fact
that
that
--
that
their
business
which
was
a
substantial
business
had
been
taken
all
for
a
nationalized
by
the
communist
regime
without
any
compensation.
and
they
expressed
the
feeling
that
if
anyone
had
any
cause
for
detesting
communism,
it
was
they
who
had
been
forced
out
of
their
own
country
and
based
it
up
and
they
vouched
for
the
petitioner
as
a
person
who
have
had
expressed
his
anticommunist
views.
and
there's
no
other
question
of
his
other
--
fulfilling
the
other
requisites
for
citizenship,
it
is
solely
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
basis
for
this
finding
of
communist
party
membership.
now,
the
statement
which
kury
attributes
to
the
petitioner,
what
wigmore
characterizes
as
an
extrajudicial
oral
admission,
is
admissible
evidence
in
a
civil
action.
but
he
indicates
that
standing
alone,
there
is
a
general
judicial
caution
and
distrust
exercised
with
respect
to
it,
particularly
when
it
concerns
the
main
controverted
fact
and
issue
in
the
case
as
it
does
concern
here.
it
is
also
the
type
of
testimony
which
is
subject
to
every
kind
of
human
failing
and
frailty
imaginable
having
to
do
as
it
does
with
a
conversation
that
took
place
16
or
so
years
ago.
this
court
has
in
certain
denaturalization
cases
commented
in
passing
upon
the
nature
of
such
testimony
in
nowak
and
then
maisenberg
where
the
court
commented
upon
the
grave
doubts
as
to
the
reliability
of
testimony
as
the
statements
attributed
to
the
petitioner
many
years
before
the
event
in
one
of
those
two
cases
of
what
--
statements
made
17
and
19
years
ago
and
this
case's
statement
16
years
ago
before
a
testimony
and
the
final
hearing
in
the
district
court.
now
the
government
states
that
it
is
the
petitioner
who
of
course
has
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
court
that
he
possesses
the
necessary
qualifications
for
citizenship.
but
i
submit
that
the
term,
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
cannot
possibly
mean
the
subjective
satisfaction
of
the
individual
judge.
a
naturalization
proceeding
has
been
held
repeatedly
to
be
a
judicial
proceeding.
in
totten
against
the
united
states
which
stated
in
an
uncertain
terms
that
it
was
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
court
stated
that
an
alien
has
a
right
to
citizenship
if
he
meets
the
statutory
qualifications
and
that
in
passing
upon
the
application,
the
court
does
not
grant
or
withhold
a
favor.
the
government
further
states
that
this
petitioner
must
be
denied
his
citizenship
if
there
is
an
element
of
doubt
which
exists
after
the
presentation
of
the
testimony.
but
i
would
stress
the
words
of
the
court
in
schwimmer
against
the
united
states
where
the
court
states
that
whereupon
a
fair
consideration
of
the
evidence
educed
doubt
exist
as
to
the
petitioner
having
met
unnecessary
qualifications,
it
should
thereupon
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government
and
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
of
my
positions
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
i
feel
that
the
court
did
not
have
substantial
evidence
upon
which
to
base
a
finding
of
membership.
that
considered
in
life
of
the
court's
pronouncement
of
the
meaningful
association
doctrine
in
rowoldt
and
gastelum-quinones,
those
cases
must
at
the
very
least,
even
though
they
are
different
types
of
proceedings
with
different
types
of
burdens,
those
cases
must
at
the
very
least
indicate
some
sort
of
minimum
substantive
standard
upon
which
a
court
can
base
a
finding
of
membership.
and
i
further
feel
that
there
is
good
ground
for
holding
that
the
meaningful
association
doctrine
should
be
extended
into
the
naturalization
field
with
respect
to
the
finding
of
memberships
so
as
to
bar
a
person
from
naturalization.
if
i
may
in
my
few
remaining
minutes
merely
discuss
this
last
point.
the
section
of
the
act
which
was
involve
in
gastelum-quinones
241
of
the
act
of
1952,
as
a
basis
for
deportation
was
identical
with
the
bar
to
naturalization
contained
of
313
of
the
naturalization
provisions
of
the
act.
if
the
term
member
has
been
construed
to
mean
one
thing
under
the
deportation
provisions
only
membership
connoting
a
meaningful
association,
it
should
certainly
have
the
same
meaning
in
another
section
of
the
same
act
with
the
same
term
as
used
and
the
same
languages
contained,
it's
almost
identically
the
same
language
as
to
the
bar
to
naturalization
and
the
grounds
for
deportation,
anybody
who's
a
member
of
such
and
such
party
of
the
united
states
of
any
foreign
state,
etcetera.
and
certainly,
congress
has
nowhere
indicated
that
is
to
be
given
a
different
meaning
in
the
naturalization
section
of
the
act
and
it
was
given
--
and
as
i
understand
it's
presently
the
law
with
respect
with
the
deportation
provisions
of
the
act
of
1952.
there's
one
other
point,
in
rowoldt,
the
court
disputed
the
derivation
of
the
meaningful
association
theory
based
upon
legislative
history
and
intent
by
finding
that
in
1951
amendment
of
the
internal
security
act
which
accepted
certain
people
from
member
--
from
the
member
definitions,
and
was
used
by
the
court
by
the
majority
opinion
to
show
that
membership
was
not
reached
in
certain
types
of
situations.
the
dissent
stated
that
this
amendment
was
only
meant
to
apply
to
exclusion
cases
and
not
to
deportation
cases
where
it
was
used,
and
pointed
out
that
in
the
intervening
enactment
of
the
1952
act,
this
amendment
had
been
reenacted
with
respect
to
exclusion
but
not
reenacted
with
respect
to
deportation.
this
enactment
however
was
enacted
with
respect
to
naturalization
and
so
that
if
it
had
a
meaning
with
respect
to
statutory
intention
as
to
the
deportation
provisions,
it
should
have
the
same
meaning
with
respect
to
the
naturalization
provisions.
finally,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
and
the
statement
of
two
witnesses,
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
yes,
it
does.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that's
the
holding
of
(inaudible)
versus
united
states.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
his
initial
burden
of
producing
evidence,
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
well
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
it
depends
upon
the
nature
and
the
quality
of
the
evidence
that
the
government
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
he
does
maintain
the
overall
burden
of
persuasion
as
it
is
termed,
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that
naturally
follows
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
if
--
the
cases
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
the
cases
do
so
that
there
is
a
circumstance
which
the
government
does
have
a
burden
of
producing
evidence
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that's
correct.
i
guess
therefore
the
implication
is
that
if
the
government
does
nothing,
the
petitioner
is
entitled
for
his
naturalization.
and
therefore,
you
get
denaturalization
proceeding
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that
is
correct,
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
in
conclusion,
i
would
further
state
that
i
don't
think
the
concurrent
findings
through
here
should
preclude
this
court
from
considering
the
question,
in
as
much
of
the
finding
of
communist
party
membership
is
such
a
type
of
finding
of
fact
that
involves
the
application
of
standards
of
law.
and
under
the
(inaudible)
case,
such
a
finding
should
not
be
precluded
from
the
consideration
of
this
court.
i
don't
have
to
dwell
here
upon
the
importance
of
the
grant
of
citizenship.
i
would
merely
paraphrase
mr.
justice
murphy
in
the
schneiderman
case
in
which
he
said,
it
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
highest
hope
of
civilized
man.
i
submit
that
this
hold
--
should
not
be
dashed
upon
the
type
of
evidence
that
has
been
educed
by
the
government
against
the
petitioner
in
the
case
at
bar.
thank
you.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
naturalization
based
upon
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
hungary.
and
that
in
denying
such
membership
and
testimony
before
the
immigration
service
on
his
naturalization
application,
he
does
gave
false
testimony
in
order
to
obtain
a
benefit
under
the
act,
the
benefit
of
naturalization.
now
as
thus
by
statutory
definition
precluded
from
being
a
person
of
good
moral
character
under
the
provisions
of
section
101
(f)
(6)
of
the
act,
the
requirement
of
good
moral
character
of
course
a
pre-requisite
to
naturalization
under
section
316
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
this
petitioner
has
never
admitted
any
communist
body
membership.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
has
denied
that
steadfastly
throughout.
and
as
a
result,
it
is
the
finding
of
communist
party
membership
by
the
district
court
upon
which
the
decision
in
this
case
hinges
for
as
the
government
appears
to
agree
at
page
17
of
its
brief,
once
the
finding
of
past
membership
was
made,
the
finding
of
false
testimony
inevitably
file
there
from.
and
conversely,
without
the
finding
of
such
membership,
the
finding
of
false
testimony
could
not
have
been
made.
now
the
--
a
brief
background
of
this
case
is
as
follows.
the
petitioner
is
a
hungarian
national,
a
medical
doctor,
who
together
with
his
wife
fled
hungary
in
november
of
1956,
a
few
days
after,
the
uprising
was
crushed.
at
that
time
together
with
thousands
of
other
people,
they
escaped
across
the
border
into
austria.
and
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
were
in
the
following
month,
december
of
1956,
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
permanent
residents.
in
january
of
1962,
after
the
lapse
of
the
five-year
statutory
residence
period,
both
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
filed
a
petition
for
naturalization.
and
after
an
extended
preliminary
investigation
and
examination,
the
designated
naturalization
examiner
in
october
of
1964
denied
--
or
pardon
me,
recommended
the
denial
of
both
petitions
upon
the
following
grounds.
with
respect
to
the
petitioner,
a
denial
was
recommended
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
within
the
ten
years
proceeding
the
filing
of
the
petition
and
his
membership
does
--
rendered
him
ineligible
for
citizenship
under
the
provisions
of
section
313
of
the
act.
those
provisions
which
born
naturalization
to
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
proscribed
organization
listed
therein.
and
the
second
ground
upon
which
denial
was
recommended
was
that
during
the
period
to
which
petitioner
was
required
to
establish
good
moral
conduct,
the
five
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition,
he
had
therefore
testified
falsely
as
to
such
communist
party
membership
in
hungary
in
order
to
facilitate
his
naturalization
and
was
therefore
by
statutory
definition
rendered
ineligible
to
be
found
to
be
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
incidentally,
the
wife's
petition
was
recommended
to
be
denied
on
the
ground
that
she
too
had
testified
falsely
before
the
immigration
service,
in
denying
her
husband's
communist
party
membership
and
that
she
was
therefore
precluded
from
being
deemed
a
person
of
good
moral
character
under
101
(f)
(6)
of
the
act.
both
petitioner
and
his
wife
requested
a
hearing
in
open
court
as
is
their
right
under
the
statute.
and
the
final
hearing
was
a
joint
hearing
on
both
petitions
in
the
district
court.
and
on
that
final
hearing,
the
government
produced
two
witnesses.
both
of
whom
were
hungarian
nationals
and
who
had
attended
medical
school
at
the
university
of
budapest
during
portions
of
the
time
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
medical
student
there.
the
petitioner
had
attended
medical
school
there
from
1946
to
1952,
it
was
a
six-year
course
he
graduated
in
1952.
at
that
time
by
the
way,
the
medical
classes
at
the
university
of
budapest
averaged
approximately
five
to
600
students
in
each
year.
now
the
government's
principal
witness
of
dr.
kury,
testified
that
he
had
entered
medical
school
in
1948,
the
same
year
as
the
petitioner,
but
that
for
the
first
two
years
he
had
have
no
contact
with
the
petitioner.
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
in
september
of
1948,
kury
testified
that
he
was
assigned
to
a
small
study
group
of
about
20
or
so
students
that
was
scheduled
to
meet
regularly
every
afternoon.
the
primary
purpose
of
these
study
groups
was
to
enable
the
students
to
discuss
and
review
on
a
more
intimate
and
closer
level
the
medical
subjects
that
they
had
been
taught
in
the
large
lecture
groups
of
several
hundred
students
earlier
in
the
day,
and
which
by
the
very
nature
of
the
size
of
this
classes
precluded
any
sort
of
informal
exchange
of
ideas.
the
medical
subjects
discussed
in
these
groups
was
under
the
leadership
of
an
upper
classmen,
a
medical
student
from
a
higher
grade.
in
addition,
in
as
much
as
the
communist
where
at
this
time
the
dominant
political
party
in
the
government
and
were
also
in
control
of
the
school
administration.
these
study
groups
were
also
required
to
discuss
the
principles
of
marxism-leninism,
and
this
aspect
of
their
activity
was
to
be
under
the
direction
of
another
student
within
the
group,
that
is
a
student
other
than
this
leader
of
the
medical
studies.
now
it's
kury's
testimony
that
he
attended
only
the
first
meeting
of
the
study
group
in
september
of
1948.
and
on
that
occasion,
there
were
about
20
or
so
students
in
attendance
of
whom
the
petitioner
was
one.
and
at
this
meeting,
each
of
the
students
was
asked
to
make
a
few
preliminary
background
remarks
about
himself
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
himself
to
the
rest
of
the
group.
and
kury
stated
that
when
it
came,
the
petitioner's
turn
to
introduce
himself
to
the
group,
the
petitioner
stated
to
the
group
that
he
was
the
person
who
was
in-charged
of
the
ideological
education
of
the
group.
kury
further
states
that
the
petitioner
also
said
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
had
joined
the
communist
party
in
1945
after
soviet
troops
had
occupied
hungary
and
that
he
further
told
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
group
that
they
should
read
certain
soviet
books,
should
see
soviet
films
and
discuss
the
news
among
themselves.
he
said
that
on
this
occasion,
petitioner
spoke
for
about
five
minutes,
did
not
asked
anybody
to
join
the
party
or
just
--
try
to
get
anybody
recruited
into
the
party.
now
after
the
first
meeting
of
this
study
group
in
september
of
1948,
kury
transferred
out
of
this
group
to
another
group
and
never
had
any
more
dealings
with
the
petitioner.
so
that
this
alleged
statement
of
the
petitioner
or
perhaps
five
minutes
duration,
made
more
than
16
years
prior
to
the
final
hearing
in
the
district
court
was
in
fact
the
court's
sole
basis
for
its
finding
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
hungary.
there
was
another
government
witness,
a
dr.
halasz.
but
halasz's
testimony
turned
up
to
be
in
fact
more
favorable
to
the
petitioner
than
it
was
to
the
government.
halasz
entered
medical
school
in
1949,
three
years
after
the
petitioner,
and
had
been
friendly
with
him
and
as
much
they
live
in
the
same
dormitory.
and
halasz
himself
was
admittedly
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
testified
the
communist
party
meetings
were
held
of
about
once
a
month
in
the
medical
school
and
that
he
attended
some
but
not
all
of
them.
at
first,
he
testified
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
at
perhaps
two
or
three
meetings
but
that
--
i'm
sorry
--
at
first,
he
testified
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
at
several
meetings
in
1950
or
'51.
but
when
pressed,
he
stated
that
it
might
have
been
two
or
three
meetings
and
perhaps
maybe
it
was
only
meeting
at
which
he
saw
the
petitioner.
he
did
not
recall
whether
any
of
these
meetings
were
open
or
closed.
he
stated
that
nonmembers
of
the
party
were
many
times
invited
to
attend
such
meetings
and
such
invitation
was
tantamount
to
an
order,
that
disobeyal
of
which
subjected
the
person
for
severe
penalties
which
might
possibly
include
expulsion
from
the
school.
he
also
stated
that
nonmembers
were
not
necessarily
identified
as
such
at
these
meetings.
the
petitioner
in
halasz's
words
was
a
brilliant
and
outstanding
medical
student
whom
the
communists
would
naturally
have
tried
to
indoctrinate
in
communism
and
would
have
invited
therefore
to
attend
these
meetings.
halasz,
the
admitted
member
of
the
party,
never
saw
any
membership
card
or
membership
book
of
the
petitioner
on
any
occasion,
though
on
some
occasions
he
was
the
doorkeeper
in-charge
of
staying
at
the
door,
checking
the
credentials
of
people
who
came
in.
he
never
saw
the
petitioner
pay
any
dues.
he
never
saw
the
petitioner's
name
on
any
party
list.
he
never
observed
the
petitioner
vote
and
he
never
saw
or
at
least
did
not
recall
ever
hearing
the
petitioner
say
anything
at
any
such
meeting.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
halasz
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
he
actually
did
not
know
whether
the
petitioner
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
that
he
had
at
one
time
made
that
assumption
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
him
at
these
meetings
or
meeting.
but
again
he
stated
that
he
did
not
recall
whether
any
such
meeting
was
open
or
closed
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
private
conversations
he
had
with
the
petitioner
at
that
time
and
as
much
as
they
were
close
friends,
he
knew
the
petitioner
to
be
quite
anticommunist
in
his
views.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
kury's
testimony,
well
kury
apparently
could
recite
this
incident
of
more
than
16
years
previously
without
too
much
difficulty.
he
could
hardly
remember
anything
else
which
transpired
at
this
one
meeting.
he
could
not
remember
who
the
medical
group
leader
of
the
studies
was.
he
could
not
remember
the
name
of
any
of
the
other
students
in
the
group.
he
could
not
admittedly
remember
the
exact
words
that
were
used
or
allegedly
used
by
the
petitioner
on
this
occasion.
he
had
never
made
any
notes
or
kept
any
diary
with
respect
to
it.
and
this
meeting
was
conceitedly
not
a
communist
party
meeting,
this
was
a
meeting
of
students
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
studies.
therefore,
based
upon
solely
the
testimony
of
kury,
the
district
court
made
its
findings
in
which
it
seem
to
have
embraced
kury's
testimony
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else.
because
of
the
time
situation,
i
am
not
going
at
length
into
the
positive
evidence
educed
in
support
of
the
petition
for
naturalization
which
i
might
say
was
quite
substantial,
but
i
am
dealing
with
that
aspect
of
the
evidence
which
was
damaging
and
which
the
court
embraced
in
making
its
findings.
the
court
didn't
make
the
following
findings,
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1945
or
rather
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1945,
the
same
year
that
russian
troops
occupied
the
country.
this
last
phrase
is
a
verbatim
quote
from
this
finding.
it
indicates
an
adoption
of
kury's
language
verbatim
even
though
this
witness
did
not
profess
to
give
the
exact
words
that
had
been
used
by
the
petitioner
on
this
occasion.
the
court
next
said
that
the
petitioner
remained
a
member
of
the
party
for
an
indefinite
number
of
years.
here,
the
district
court
differed
with
the
naturalization
examiner's
findings
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
within
the
proscribe
ten-year
period
was
therefore
currently
ineligible
under
section
313.
but
then
as
much
as
there
was
no
testimony
in
the
record
to
indicate
any
landfall
of
duration
of
membership,
the
court
instead
characterized
the
duration
of
the
petitioner's
membership
and
its
finding
of
fact
as
an
indefinite
number
of
years.
it
then
found
that
the
petitioner
attended
closed
meetings
of
the
party.
on
this,
there
was
no
testimony
at
all
to
justify
this
finding.
the
only
witness
who
testified
as
to
any
meetings
was
halasz.
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
could
not
recall
whether
any
meeting
at
which
he
saw
the
petitioner
was
open
or
closed.
this
seems
to
have
been
a
gratuitous
finding
on
the
part
of
the
court.
the
next
finding
that
petitioner
was
in-charge
of
instruction
in
communist
ideology
at
student
study
groups
for
an
undetermined
period
of
time.
this
again
is
based
solely
upon
the
alleged
statement
which
kury
attributes
to
the
petitioner.
it
was
absolutely
no
independent
evidence
at
all
of
the
petitioner
having
engaged
in
any
such
activities
as
the
statement
allegedly
--
as
the
finding
allegedly
describes
or
have
often
having
engaged
in
any
activities
of
the
communist
party,
there
is
only
the
statement,
the
extrajudicial
admission
that
is
attributed
to
him
by
the
witness
kury.
lastly,
the
court
found
that
the
petitioner
did
not
participate
in
the
hungarian
revolt.
he
made
this
--
the
district
court
made
this
as
an
affirmative
finding.
not
only
was
there
no
evidence
on
this
at
all.
but
on
the
contrary,
the
only
evidence
with
respect
to
this
point
was
the
petitioner's
testimony
in
which
he
stated
that
is
army
unit
fought
against
the
russians
during
the
hungarian
uprising,
and
that
during
the
revolt,
he
was
continually
on
duty
in
the
hospital
treating
the
wounded.
based
upon
the
finding
of
past
communist
party
membership,
the
district
court
there
found
that
the
petitioner
had
caused
testified
falsely
and
he
was
statutorily
excluded
from
becoming
naturalized
--
statutory
excluded
from
being
a
person
of
good
moral
character
as
would
permit
his
naturalization.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
no,
sir.
the
wife
was
granted
her
citizenship
--
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
point
in
a
moment.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
i
did
not
mean
to
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
--
fend
off
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
the
wife
--
well
if
i
may,
the
--
this
--
the
appellate
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
affirmed,
they
affirmed
unanimously.
they
held
that
while
the
petitioner
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
good
moral
character.
this
merely
imposed
the
burden
of
going
fall
out
of
producing
evidence
on
the
government.
and
they
then
said,
that
the
district
court's
belief
of
the
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
adequately
satisfied
the
burden
of
the
government
in
going
forward
and
that
giving
due
weight
to
the
opportunity
of
the
trial
court
to
observe
the
conduct
and
demeanor
of
witnesses,
it
could
not
say
that
the
trial
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
getting
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
wife's
petition,
the
district
court
granted
the
wife's
petition.
and
they
granted
the
wife's
petition
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
same
witnesses
whose
credibility
they
apparently
approved
off
with
respect
to
the
wife
who
are
the
same
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
this
was
a
joint
hearing.
there
is
no
mentioned
by
the
way
in
the
record
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
in
anyway
cast
any
reflection
upon
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
witnesses
were
i
think
persons
of
established
reputation
in
the
community.
one
was
a
doctor
on
the
staff
of
temple
university
who
had
been
on
the
staff
of
this
medical
school
of
the
university
of
budapest
that
are
about
the
same
time
the
petitioner
was
there.
another
one
was
an
engineer
who
had
known
the
petitioner
in
hungary
at
or
about
the
time
in
question
here
and
who
himself
was
an
avowed
anticommunist
to
the
extent
but
he
was
imprisoned
--
arrested
twice,
imprisoned
once
and
exiled
once
for
his
anticommunist
activities.
this
man
stood
up
and
vouched
for
the
petitioner's
anticommunist
views.
and
views
that
had
been
expressed
at
or
about
the
time
in
question
back
in
hungary.
he
also
produced
the
lady
with
whom
he
and
his
wife
had
lived
shortly
after
their
marriage
in
1952
until
the
time
they
all
fled
together
in
1956,
this
lady
was
the
aunt
of
the
wife.
and
he
also
produced
among
his
other
witnesses,
the
mother
of
the
wife.
the
mother
of
the
wife
had
left
hungary
with
her
husband
and
two
younger
children
some
time
previously
because
of
the
fact
that
that
--
that
their
business
which
was
a
substantial
business
had
been
taken
all
for
a
nationalized
by
the
communist
regime
without
any
compensation.
and
they
expressed
the
feeling
that
if
anyone
had
any
cause
for
detesting
communism,
it
was
they
who
had
been
forced
out
of
their
own
country
and
based
it
up
and
they
vouched
for
the
petitioner
as
a
person
who
have
had
expressed
his
anticommunist
views.
and
there's
no
other
question
of
his
other
--
fulfilling
the
other
requisites
for
citizenship,
it
is
solely
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
basis
for
this
finding
of
communist
party
membership.
now,
the
statement
which
kury
attributes
to
the
petitioner,
what
wigmore
characterizes
as
an
extrajudicial
oral
admission,
is
admissible
evidence
in
a
civil
action.
but
he
indicates
that
standing
alone,
there
is
a
general
judicial
caution
and
distrust
exercised
with
respect
to
it,
particularly
when
it
concerns
the
main
controverted
fact
and
issue
in
the
case
as
it
does
concern
here.
it
is
also
the
type
of
testimony
which
is
subject
to
every
kind
of
human
failing
and
frailty
imaginable
having
to
do
as
it
does
with
a
conversation
that
took
place
16
or
so
years
ago.
this
court
has
in
certain
denaturalization
cases
commented
in
passing
upon
the
nature
of
such
testimony
in
nowak
and
then
maisenberg
where
the
court
commented
upon
the
grave
doubts
as
to
the
reliability
of
testimony
as
the
statements
attributed
to
the
petitioner
many
years
before
the
event
in
one
of
those
two
cases
of
what
--
statements
made
17
and
19
years
ago
and
this
case's
statement
16
years
ago
before
a
testimony
and
the
final
hearing
in
the
district
court.
now
the
government
states
that
it
is
the
petitioner
who
of
course
has
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
court
that
he
possesses
the
necessary
qualifications
for
citizenship.
but
i
submit
that
the
term,
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
cannot
possibly
mean
the
subjective
satisfaction
of
the
individual
judge.
a
naturalization
proceeding
has
been
held
repeatedly
to
be
a
judicial
proceeding.
in
totten
against
the
united
states
which
stated
in
an
uncertain
terms
that
it
was
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
court
stated
that
an
alien
has
a
right
to
citizenship
if
he
meets
the
statutory
qualifications
and
that
in
passing
upon
the
application,
the
court
does
not
grant
or
withhold
a
favor.
the
government
further
states
that
this
petitioner
must
be
denied
his
citizenship
if
there
is
an
element
of
doubt
which
exists
after
the
presentation
of
the
testimony.
but
i
would
stress
the
words
of
the
court
in
schwimmer
against
the
united
states
where
the
court
states
that
whereupon
a
fair
consideration
of
the
evidence
educed
doubt
exist
as
to
the
petitioner
having
met
unnecessary
qualifications,
it
should
thereupon
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government
and
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
of
my
positions
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
i
feel
that
the
court
did
not
have
substantial
evidence
upon
which
to
base
a
finding
of
membership.
that
considered
in
life
of
the
court's
pronouncement
of
the
meaningful
association
doctrine
in
rowoldt
and
gastelum-quinones,
those
cases
must
at
the
very
least,
even
though
they
are
different
types
of
proceedings
with
different
types
of
burdens,
those
cases
must
at
the
very
least
indicate
some
sort
of
minimum
substantive
standard
upon
which
a
court
can
base
a
finding
of
membership.
and
i
further
feel
that
there
is
good
ground
for
holding
that
the
meaningful
association
doctrine
should
be
extended
into
the
naturalization
field
with
respect
to
the
finding
of
memberships
so
as
to
bar
a
person
from
naturalization.
if
i
may
in
my
few
remaining
minutes
merely
discuss
this
last
point.
the
section
of
the
act
which
was
involve
in
gastelum-quinones
241
of
the
act
of
1952,
as
a
basis
for
deportation
was
identical
with
the
bar
to
naturalization
contained
of
313
of
the
naturalization
provisions
of
the
act.
if
the
term
member
has
been
construed
to
mean
one
thing
under
the
deportation
provisions
only
membership
connoting
a
meaningful
association,
it
should
certainly
have
the
same
meaning
in
another
section
of
the
same
act
with
the
same
term
as
used
and
the
same
languages
contained,
it's
almost
identically
the
same
language
as
to
the
bar
to
naturalization
and
the
grounds
for
deportation,
anybody
who's
a
member
of
such
and
such
party
of
the
united
states
of
any
foreign
state,
etcetera.
and
certainly,
congress
has
nowhere
indicated
that
is
to
be
given
a
different
meaning
in
the
naturalization
section
of
the
act
and
it
was
given
--
and
as
i
understand
it's
presently
the
law
with
respect
with
the
deportation
provisions
of
the
act
of
1952.
there's
one
other
point,
in
rowoldt,
the
court
disputed
the
derivation
of
the
meaningful
association
theory
based
upon
legislative
history
and
intent
by
finding
that
in
1951
amendment
of
the
internal
security
act
which
accepted
certain
people
from
member
--
from
the
member
definitions,
and
was
used
by
the
court
by
the
majority
opinion
to
show
that
membership
was
not
reached
in
certain
types
of
situations.
the
dissent
stated
that
this
amendment
was
only
meant
to
apply
to
exclusion
cases
and
not
to
deportation
cases
where
it
was
used,
and
pointed
out
that
in
the
intervening
enactment
of
the
1952
act,
this
amendment
had
been
reenacted
with
respect
to
exclusion
but
not
reenacted
with
respect
to
deportation.
this
enactment
however
was
enacted
with
respect
to
naturalization
and
so
that
if
it
had
a
meaning
with
respect
to
statutory
intention
as
to
the
deportation
provisions,
it
should
have
the
same
meaning
with
respect
to
the
naturalization
provisions.
finally,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
and
the
statement
of
two
witnesses,
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
yes,
it
does.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that's
the
holding
of
(inaudible)
versus
united
states.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
his
initial
burden
of
producing
evidence,
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
well
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
it
depends
upon
the
nature
and
the
quality
of
the
evidence
that
the
government
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
he
does
maintain
the
overall
burden
of
persuasion
as
it
is
termed,
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that
naturally
follows
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
if
--
the
cases
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
the
cases
do
so
that
there
is
a
circumstance
which
the
government
does
have
a
burden
of
producing
evidence
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that's
correct.
i
guess
therefore
the
implication
is
that
if
the
government
does
nothing,
the
petitioner
is
entitled
for
his
naturalization.
and
therefore,
you
get
denaturalization
proceeding
--
mr.
leon
b.
savetsky
that
is
correct,
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
in
conclusion,
i
would
further
state
that
i
don't
think
the
concurrent
findings
through
here
should
preclude
this
court
from
considering
the
question,
in
as
much
of
the
finding
of
communist
party
membership
is
such
a
type
of
finding
of
fact
that
involves
the
application
of
standards
of
law.
and
under
the
(inaudible)
case,
such
a
finding
should
not
be
precluded
from
the
consideration
of
this
court.
i
don't
have
to
dwell
here
upon
the
importance
of
the
grant
of
citizenship.
i
would
merely
paraphrase
mr.
justice
murphy
in
the
schneiderman
case
in
which
he
said,
it
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
highest
hope
of
civilized
man.
i
submit
that
this
hold
--
should
not
be
dashed
upon
the
type
of
evidence
that
has
been
educed
by
the
government
against
the
petitioner
in
the
case
at
bar.
thank
you.
