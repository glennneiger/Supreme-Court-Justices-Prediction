mr.

may
i
ask
you
a
second.
was
there
anything
in

record
--
i
know
it'd
be
difficult
to
get
anything
you
--
but
was
there
anything
in
the
record
that
challenged
the
petitioner's
testimony
that
he
was
in
the
regiment
that
fought
against
the
soviet
troops
during
the
hungarian
uprising?
justice

he

and
then
he
left

justice

what
kind
of

service.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rifkind,
this
man
as
denied
naturalization
as
i
understand
that
because
he's
supposed
to
have
made
false
statement
with
respect
to
membership
in
the
communist
party.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
on
this
record,
the
first
and
second
as
a
matter
of
general
principle,
what
constitutes
membership
in
the
communist
party
for
this
purpose?
i
think
that
may
be
the
issue
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you've
just
told
us
that
their
--
was
not
meaningful
association
in
this
case
in
that
sense
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
so
that
if
that's
the
standard
then
you
have
no
case.
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
are
the
alternatives
on

what
does
a
government
relied
up
here
defending
this
order?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
asking
you
that.
i'm
asking
you,
what
is
membership
in
the
communist
party?
as
i
see
this
record,
nobody
said
that
he
had
--
that
he
saw
the
inscribed
role
of
the
communist
party
with
this
fellow's
name
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
he
is

membership
in

suppose
a

for
this
purpose.
supposed

is
that
kind
of
thing
make
him
a
communist
or
what
just
--
what
is
it
that
the
government
says.
say,
at
first
is
a
--
in
this
record,
and
second
is
a
matter
of
theory
shows
that
this
man
lied.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
would
consider
that
that
is
adequate.
that
is
to
say
a
person's
own
statement
is
sufficient
to
make
a
subsequent
declaration
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
communist
party
make
that
perjury
or
a
false
statement
rather.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
tried
the
cast
down
on
it
here
by
saying,
“what
to
my
mind
is
the
most
impressive
thing
in
this
record.”
now,
it
says
that
he
was
on
a
regiment
that
his
testimony
is
to
be
believed
that
as
a
doctor
that
support
the
communist
at
the
time
of
the
hungarian
uprising
and
then
the
second
and
to
me
most
important
that
he
left
the
country
i
think
“fled”
is
the
word
used
in
the
record
after
the
communist
crushed
the
uprising.
justice
abe
fortas
no
contentment.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you
say
--
what
makes
you
say
that
he
lied
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
you
say
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
because
in
hungary
--
according
to
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
he
said
he
is
a
member
of
the
party.
he
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
party.
and
in
addition,
there's
testimony
that
he
did
those
things
principally
attend
meetings
which
were
open
only
to
members
of
the
party
which
nonmembers
would
not
be
free
to
do.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
question
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
he
says
that
arguendo,
doesn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
you
can't
say
that
he
says
in
arguendo
and
he's
not
taking
a
--
change
his
position,
each
one
or
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rifkind,
the
government
presented
two
witnesses
here.
their
testimonies
summarized
at
the
government's
brief.
one
of
them
was
dr.
kury,
the
other
is
dr.
halasz.
does
the
government
rely
on
the
testimony
of
dr.halasz?
justice
abe
fortas
despite
the
substance
of
that
testimony
as
set
out
on
pages
68
of
your
own
briefing?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
there
in
dr.
halasz's
testimony
that
supports
this
finding
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
not
--
i
think
we
don't
have
it
a
little
straighter
than
that
it
would
be
--
if
i
may
ask
your
indulgence
because
your
own
brief
says
that
dr.
halasz
had
been
assigned
to
check
that
those
attending
a
meeting
were
carrying
their
private
cards.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
had
never
seen
a
membership
card
for
petitioner.
from
having
seen
petitioner
at
meetings,
dr.
halasz
had
thought
that
petitioner
was
a
party
member.
and
as
i
read
your
summary,
that's
the
only
thing
that's
in
here
from
dr.
halasz.
then
he
goes
on
the
say
that
he
did
not
in
fact
know
where
the
petitioner
was
a
member
or
whether
he
was
a
nonmember
who
had
been
invited
to
attend.
and
he
says,
he
didn't
--
they
did
not
believed
--
he
stated,
halasz
stated,
that
he
did
not
believe
petitioner
was
a
communist
that
hardly
even
if
he
was
a
member,
petitioner
had
and
i
am
quoting
from
your
brief.
petitioner
had
occasionally
helped
dr.
halasz
with
his
medical
studies
in
the
course
of
which
petitioner
had
made
statements
against
the
party
and
the
regime.
but
you're
telling
me
that
you're
relying
not
only
that
the
government
of
the
united
states,
that
relying
not

on
the
testimony
of
dr.
kury
but
also
on
the
testimony
of
dr.

i
