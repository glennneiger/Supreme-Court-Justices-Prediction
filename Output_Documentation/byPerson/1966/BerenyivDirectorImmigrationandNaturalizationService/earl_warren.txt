well,

--
what

mr.

do
you
--
even

the

when
he
is
accused
by
a
witness

whatever
his

yes.
chief

but
does
it
go

requiring
him
to
prove
that

disprove
the
testimony
of
dr.

chief

is
on

to
prove

leaves
a
man
on

16
years
before
at
a
meeting
where
the
witness
can
identify,
no
other
person
who
attended
the

him
that

admitted
at
that
time,
being
almost
a
boy
at
the
time
too
that
he
was
a
communist.
chief

and
in
a
foreign
country
too
where
he
can't
bring
any
witnesses
or
anything
of
that
kind,
pretty
heavy
burden
on
a
man,
isn't
it?

somebody
said,
