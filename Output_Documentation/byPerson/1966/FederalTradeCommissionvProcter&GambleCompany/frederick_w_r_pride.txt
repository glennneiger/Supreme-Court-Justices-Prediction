mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
may
it
please
the
court.
the
presentation
here
of
the
distinguished
solicitor
general,
certainly
points
up
that
in
this
situation
certainly
the
federal
trade
commission
inveighs
against
the
size
of
these
acquiring
companies
and
indeed
as
i
gather
from
the
presentation,
there
is
the
feeling
here
that
in
some
way
or
other
in
these
conglomerate
merger
situations
that
the
commission
should
have
some
easier
way
to
get
its
hands
on
them
rather
than
the
standards
which
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
now,
of
course,
this
emphasis
upon
the
size
of
procter,
of
course,
the
emphasis
on
the
size
of
clorox
in
its
relatively
small
industry,
there
is
no
dispute
about
these
factors.
the
whole
point
is
whether
if
this
conglomerate
merger,
a
merger
in
which
there
has
been
no
elimination
of
a
competitor,
in
which
there
has
been
no
concentration
brought
about
in
the
market,
whether
on
the
basis
of
assumptions
related
solely
to
the
size
of
these
two
companies,
section
7
has
been
violated.
i
respectfully
say,
your
honor,
that
is
to
each,
thank
you.
i
respectfully
say
that
is
to
each
of
your
decisions
in
this
merger
field
you
have
held
the
government
properly
so
to
the
birth
of
establishing
that
a
probable
lessening
of
competition
would
be
caused
by
the
merger.
you
upheld
them
to
that
standard
not
on
the
basis
that
some
assumptions
can
be
a
substitute
for
evidence
or
on
the
basis
that
speculation
here
can
supplant
a
lack
a
proof.
and
i
turn
here
to
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
for
that
is
what
you
have
for
reviewing.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
approach
to
the
issues
which
were
raised
before
it.
well,
on
the
face
of
the
court's
opinion,
of
course,
there
is
reflected
a
conscientious
and
thorough
examination
of
this
record.
you
have
the
decision
of
this
tribunal,
its
considered
judgment
that
in
this
area
which
you
have
said
time
and
again
is
particularly
within
the
competence
of
the
court
of
appeals,
an
area
in
which
you
said
--
have
said
that
the
congress
entrusted
the
responsibility
of
reviewing
these
decisions
that
here,
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
an
exhaustive
examination
of
a
record
to
the
point
where
there
is
not
even
a
claim
here
that
in
anyway
its
review
was
inadequate.
and
now
the
solicitor
general
has
said
this
morning,
“but
the
trouble
is
that
it
did
not
understand
the
government's
theories,
the
reliance
of
the
government
upon
the
points
which
he
is
accented.”
but
this
is
--
this
does
not
come
through.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
misconception
about
the
government's
theories
of
illegality,
rather
it
tested
and
it
--
it
examined,
it
reaccepted
each
one
of
them.
it
examined
into
the
record
and
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
warrant
their
applicant
in
this
case
and
turning
to
that.
i
first
go
to
this
theory
of
illegality
which
the
solicitor
general
has
discussed
namely
that
procter
itself
was
a
potential
competitor
in
this
liquid
bleach
industry.
to
that
point,
your
honors,
has
had
a
very
strange
genesis.
no
such
claim
was
advanced
in
the
complaint
in
this
action.
at
no
time
during
the
lengthy
trial
proceedings
was
any
such
point
either
urged
or
was
any
indication
given
that
the
commission
was
relying
upon
any
such
contention.
indeed,
it
was
not
until
long
after
the
record
was
closed
in
the
course
of
a
second
appeal
to
the
commission
when
it
sua
sponte
for
the
first
time
gave
voice
to
this
theory.
the
result
has
been
that
it
has
attempted
to
extract
from
a
barren
record
some
evidence
to
support
this
claim
of
procter's
status
as
an
independent
entrant.
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
what
he
said
were
two
memoranda.
well
i
say
that
there
is
not
--
that
no
one
can
extract
from
either
one
of
these
the
slightest
indication
that
procter
on
its
own
had
any
interest
in
going
into
this
liquid
bleach
industry.
the
stockholders
of
the
clorox
company
initiated
this
acquisition
entirely
on
their
own.
these
men
had
their
life
work
in
this
--
their
ownership
of
this
business
by
reason
of
age
and
health,
they
were
just
--
just
had
to
get
out
of
the
operations.
and
it
was
their
desire
to
sell
their
interest
to
or
to
exchange
their
interest
for
the
marketable
securities
of
a
large
company
to
give
some
element
of
liquidity
to
their
estates.
so
procter
was
approached.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
no,
sir.
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
was
held
closely
by
the
great
majority
of
the
stock
being
held
by
the
management
executives
in
the
company.
now,
up
to
the
time
of
the
first
(inaudible)
that
were
made
to
procter
by
these
stockholders,
there
is
not
a
hint,
not
a
suggestion
in
this
record
that
procter
had
any
interest
whatsoever
in
investing
its
money
an
independent
entry
into
this
relatively
small
industry.
the
negotiations
which
ensued
occasioned
the
only
piece
of
paper
which
refers
in
any
way
to
independent
entry.
what
was
that?
it
was
a
memorandum
prepared
by
an
employee
in
procter's
promotion
department
analyzing
the
reasonableness
of
the
price
which
the
clorox
stockholders
were
asking
for
their
stock.
and
in
connection
with
that
analysis,
he
engaged
in
an
estimate
of
what
the
cost
of
independent
entry
might
be.
on
its
face,
the
memorandum
shows
that
it
had
no
other
purpose
that
it
reflected
in
no
way
any
thought
that
procter
would
go
into
the
business.
but
what
is
even
more
significant
about
this
piece
of
paper,
about
which
the
solicitor
general
has
thought
is
that
on
the
face
of
it,
contains
the
flat
unequivocal
recommendation
that
procter
not
go
into
this
business
on
its
own.
and
so
we
have
here
the
paradox
of
the
one
piece
of
paper
that
talks
about
this
subject
in
any
way,
incidental
or
otherwise,
contains
a
recommendation
that
procter
not
engage
in
the
business.
now,
the
second
thing
about
this
is
that
of
course,
there
isn't
the
word
testament
in
this
record
on
this
subject.
the
officials
of
procter
testified
at
length.
not
a
single
question
was
ever
addressed
to
them,
bore
in
any
way
upon
this
point
and
the
net
result
of
it
all
was
of
course
that
they
had
no
opportunity
to
demonstrate,
to
demonstrate
why
it
was
that
independent
entry
into
this
sort
of
a
business
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
company.
and
i
come
to
the
point
that
you
have
said,
your
honors,
in
your
last
decision
dealing
with
this
point
of
potential
entry
that
it
must
be
established
by
some
evidence
in
the
record,
and
i
would
just
point
up
the
bareness
of
this
record
by
contrasting
it
with
what
you
had
before
you
in
the
panel
and
case
where
there
you
pointed
out
that
each
of
the
joint
ventures
there
had
evidenced,
a
long
sustained
and
strong
interest
in
entering
the
market.
also,
you
pointed
out
that
each
of
those
companies
had
compelling
reasons
for
entering
the
market.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
any
such
self
evidence
here.
you
also
noted
that
the
industry
was
rapidly
expanding
in
terms
of
new
markets
and
new
uses
for
the
product.
but
here,
there
is
not
the
slightest
showing
that
any
such
conditions
existed
and
indeed
the
evidence
here
is
not
that
the
existing
facilities
were
not
adequate
to
supply
actual
and
prospective
demands,
but
that
it
is
exactly
to
the
contract.
and
also
in
the
panel
and
your
honors,
it
was
said
that
the
record
showed
that
each
of
the
ventures
could
have
gone
into
the
market
at
a
reasonable
profit.
the
only
thing
remotely
touching
on
that
factor
here
is
the
testimony
that
liquid
bleach
was
a
low
profit
product
with
no
showing,
respecting
any
profit
potential
which
would
attract
new
entries.
i
say
that
these
are
the
factors
which
would
be
your
significance
to
any
businessman
in
any
realistic
way
in
determining
whether
he
would
invest
his
money
in
entry
into
a
new
product
market.
yet
contrary
to
what
you
add
in
panel
and
there's
not
even
a
barebones
of
any
such
showing
here
and
yet
there
it
was
held
that
the
evidence
was
not
conclusive
that
each
of
the
joint
ventures
would
have
entered
on
its
own
and
you
remanded
the
case.
now,
respecting
this
whole
point
of
procter
as
a
potential
entry
i
maintain
and
respectively
suggest
that
on
this
record,
considering
the
origin
of
all
these,
considering
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
but
sheer
assumption
that
because
--
because
procter
is
a
multi-product
company
and
because
liquid
bleach
is
used
in
washing
machines
and
sold
through
supermarkets,
the
government
and
on
this
alone
is
(inaudible)
that
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
potential
entrant.
they
say
the
record
will
support
no
such
theory,
no
such
conclusion.
the
court
of
appeals
carefully
looked
into
all
these
evidence.
it
said
in
respect
of
evidence,
not
theories.
it
said
in
respect
of
evidence
no
less
than
four
times
that
on
the
record
here
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
procter
had
any
intention
of
going
into
the
business
and
nothing
to
show
any
probability
that
it
might
have
done
so.
now,
you
have
the
other
prong
of
this
argument
which
was
somewhat
likely
touched
on
this
morning
that
regardless
of
whether
procter
really
would
have
gone
into
the
business
regardless
of
the
evidence
on
that
point
that
some
significance
attaches
to
what
clorox
would
have
thought
procter
might
have
done.
and
hence,
the
theory
goes
that
regardless
of
a
--
any
likelihood,
clorox
must
have
been
--
must
have
feared
procter
as
a
potential
entrant
and
hence
administered
its
pricing
policies
in
the
light
of
that
concern.
well
as
to
that,
i
can
simply
observe
what
i
have
said
about
the
utter
lack
of
anything
here
to
indicate
why
procter
might
have
gone
into
this
particular
industry.
i
say
that
any
imaginary
psychological
concern
by
the
clorox
management
in
that
direction
would
have
been
both
irrational
and
illogic.
and
i
maintain
that
on
this
aspect
of
the
government's
theory
of
illegality,
there
is
just
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
it
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
rejected.
before
leaving
this
point
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
i
need
not
labor
here
the
extent
or
reliance
of
the
respondent
on
the
significance
of
that
decision,
the
significance
of
it
in
the
light
of
the
principles
which
this
court
expressed
in
the
universal
camera.
i
say
that
on
--
in
this
particular
setting,
where
this
decision
below
rest
entirely
upon
the
determination
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
conclusions
that
this
in
particular
is
a
case
which
calls
for
the
application
of
that
standard
of
review
which
your
honors
have
enunciated
being
one
in
which
the
court
will
not
intervene
to
set
aside
decisions
of
the
court
below
predicated
upon
--
on
the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
unless
there
is
the
rare
instance
of
a
gross
misapplication
or
gross
misapprehension
of
the
standards
of
review.
next,
your
honor,
is
i
like
to
talk
about
this
second
theory
of
illegality
the
solicitor
general
has
discussed.
this
is
the
proposition
that
regardless
of
all
else,
procter's
substitution
for
clorox
in
this
industry
will
have
such
substantial
deterrent
effects
upon
potential
competition
as
to
violate
the
statute.
now,
the
--
the
solicitor
general
gave
expression
to
the
certain
facets
of
the
post
acquisition
evidenced
here
which
lower
upon
conditions
in
the
industry
after
the
acquisition
occurred.
the
more
important
aspects
of
that,
i
maintain
go
to
the
question
upon
--
to
the
issue
in
respect
of
effects
upon
this
some
class
of
potential
competitors
where
the
government's
theory
as
premised
upon
its
assumptions
that
what
it
cause
competitive
advantages
which
would
stem
from
the
acquisition
would
be
of
such
significance
as
to
cause
other
people
who
might
have
come
in
to
stay
away.
well,
inline
with
this,
i
simply
note
that
as
to
some
of
these
other
factors
which
--
as
to
which
there
was
no
evidence,
the
commission
in
the
trial
proceedings
along
trial
proceedings
here,
examined
into
every
conceivable
advantage
which
it
could
dream
up
as
stemming
from
the
acquisition.
it
--
these
were
gone
into
hearings
--
hearings
throughout
the
country.
the
net
result
of
them
has
been
that
most
of
them
have
fallen
by
the
wayside.
they're
not
even
in
the
government's
briefs,
do
we
hear
anything
about.
and
in
that
respect,
i
was
somewhat
surprised
this
morning
that
i
heard
nothing
from
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
about
these
advantages
which
are
the
things
that
the
government
has
contended
are
going
to
keep
other
people
from
getting
into
this
business.
for
example,
regardless
of
all
the
time
put
into
it
in
the
trial
proceeding,
there
is
no
--
no
claim
here
that
there
were
any
advantages
in
production,
manufacture,
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
acquisition.
as
to
distribution,
the
government
does
talk
in
its
brief
about
procter's
large
sales
force
that
there
is
no
direct
claim
that
that
--
that
the
clorox
distribution
system
through
a
network
of
brokers
would
be
discontinued.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
none
and
that
there
was
no
reason
to
--
no
showing
as
to
why
it
would
be
of
an
advantage
anyway.
no
--
no
showing
here
that
by
reason
of
procter's
ownership,
there
would
be
some
more
easy
access
to
shelf
space.
or
is
there
anything
to
establish
that
any
knowhow
or
expertise
that
procter
would
augment
the
demonstrated
merchandising
abilities
of
clorox.
and
that
court
of
appeals
so
held
as
to
that
issue,
one
thing
which
has
been
emphasized
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
in
this
so-called
competitive
advantages.
it
is
a
matter
of
which
the
solicitor
general
has
not
adverted
as
yet.
yet
this
--
this
was
a
matter
which
the
government
has
said
in
its
briefs
represented
the
most
conspicuous
cost
advantage
which
could
be
a
tribute
of
the
acquisition.
and
that
was
this
matter
of
discounts
in
network
television.
the
government's
papers,
this
has
been
accented
then
exaggerated
as
the
one
thing
which
shows
that
this
substitution
of
procter
for
clorox
had
great
competitive
significance.
well,
i
can
understand
the
--
the
soft-pedaling
this
now.
in
the
first
place,
both
before
and
the
--
and
after
this
acquisition,
clorox
never
used
network
television.
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
discounts
or
available
funds
or
what
have
you.
simply
based
upon
the
decision
of
management,
the
clorox
advertising
agency
that
in
this
sort
of
a
regionally
oriented
business,
network
television
was
inappropriate
and
that
spot
television
was
the
only
thing
should
--
that
should
be
utilized.
and
it's
the
only
thing
that
ever
has
been
utilized
and
there's
nothing
to
show
that
there
is
any
reason
why
conditions
have
changed
or
would
change.
but
in
the
second,
as
to
this
most
commission
says
or
which
the
government
says
it's
the
most
conspicuous
cost
advantage.
the
circumstances
are
that
these
discounts
which
have
been
built
up
as
representing
tremendous
savings
or
potential
savings,
the
fact
is
that
the
discounts
have
either
been
completely
discontinued
by
this
time
or
being
discontinued
by
all
three
of
the
networks.
this
was
not
only
widely
publicized,
but
it
was
a
subject
of
testimony
before
senate
hearings
at
the
end
of
last
year,
the
same
hearings
which
the
government
refers
to
in
its
brief
and
in
which
the
--
all
of
the
representatives
of
all
networks
testified
that
this,
whatever
importance
they
have
was
a
thing
of
the
past.
i
can
understand
this
--
the
grant
of
the
government
been
resting
so
much
of
its
case
upon
these
discounts
as
has
been
done
in
its
brief
and
upon
its
contention
that
they
have
anti-competitive
significance.
and
i
say
that
particular
because
in
the
same
senate
hearings
at
which
this
network
representatives
testified
and
which
went
into
all
claims
about
discriminations
and
discounts
and
otherwise
in
advertising,
mr.
zimmerman,
the
acting
assistant
attorney
general
testified
and
he
testified
and
stated
he
was
testifying
four
of
the
antitrust
division.
his
comments
respecting
these
advertising
discounts
which
have
been
so
built
up
here
as
well
as
other
forms
of
so-called
discriminations.
his
testimony
was,
i
quote,
“we
do
not
know
to
what
extent
if
at
all
these
forms
of
discrimination
exist
nor
do
we
know
how
serious
an
impact
they
might
have.”
he
concluded
with
the
colorful
observation.
we
have
no
view
one
way
or
the
other
on
whether
we
have
an
octopus
or
a
pussy
cat
here.
and
i
say
that
the
anomalous
or
any
judgment
to
be
predicated
in
any
respect
upon
either
the
substantiality
or
the
likelihood
or
any
effects
resulting
from
what
are
now
these
non-existent
discounts.
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
probably
touched
upon
the
decisive
intention
of
the
government
here
when
he
alluded
to
procter's
size
to
its
success
in
connection
with
various
products
to
its
large
expenditures
for
advertising.
of
course,
i
simply
say
in
passing
as
to
this
millions
that
said
procter
spends
because
this
overlooks
completely
the
realism
that
these
advertising
expenditures
had
to
support
some
30
or
more
major
products.
and
on
the
government's
own
--
on
the
face
of
the
government's
brief,
it
appears
that
the
average
expenditure
for
each
of
these
procter
products
were
substantially
less
--
substantially
less
than
clorox
spent
in
the
year
before
the
acquisition
for
advertising
and
promotion.
and
the
solicitor
general
also
made
reference
to
another
procter
product
commenting
which
he
said
was
introduced
by
procter
and
achieved
widespread
acceptance.
but
the
implication
that
i
got
from
this
recital
was
that
procter's
spending
of
some
$7
million
within
a
22
months
period
to
launch
this
new
and
improved,
demonstrably
improved
product
that
in
somehow
or
other
this
reflected
--
had
some
sinister
significance.
but
the
fact
of
the
mater
is
that
in
that
same
22
months
period
as
the
record
here
shows,
clorox
chemical
company
on
its
own
before
the
acquisition
had
spent
more
than
that
in
the
advertising
of
the
established
clorox
product
and
where
no
extensive
introductory
expenses
were
required.
i
say
that
these
--
these
references
to
events
like
this
without
some
indication
of
why
they
are
significant
or
important
or
fit
into
this
whole
line
of
assumptions
by
the
government,
the
just
as
meetings
and
that
you're
down
to
--
i
started
to
say,
this
point
that
by
reason
of
procter's
size
just
it's
--
it's
the
abstract
point
of
it
being
a
--
a
big
company
that
somebody,
some
potential
competitor
would
be
scared
of
and
not
come
in.
this
assumption
the
government
is
--
is
presenting
here,
and
that
is
all
it
is.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
did
not
attribute
that
to
him.
no,
sir,
i
say
that
in
--
on
analysis,
that
is
what
the
government's
contention
comes
down
to
and
i
recognize
that
he
just
claimed
that.
it
has
been
disclaimed
here.
but
your
honor
i
--
i
say
that
on
a
record
such
as
this
where
we're
talking
about
something
supported
by
substantial
evidence
not
by
some
visceral
reaction
as
to
how
somebody
might
--
psychological
reactions
of
some
possible
entry.
on
this
--
on
this
record,
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
it
is
anything
but
procter's
size.
now,
at
some
other
records,
some
other
case
that
this
is
--
this
may
have
a
different
import
but
the
--
the
--
in
any
--
in
phrasing
through
with
that,
the
government
recognized
that
it
could
not
simply
leave
this
class
of
supposititious
possible
entrance
hanging
in
a
vacuum.
it
purported
to
give
some
identification
to
that
and
it
said
that
they
might
be
large
multi
product
companies
like
colgate
or
lever
brothers
or
general
food.
and
of
course
there
isn't
a
word
in
this
record
which
supports
any
deep
such
deduction
or
any
word
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
these
companies
or
anybody
else
might
be
interested
or
attracted
to
going
into
this
business
on
their
own.
but
even
if
you
want
to
indulge
in
those
assumptions,
i
say
why
would
any
of
these
companies
be
deterred
by
procter's
substitution?
are
they
competing
with
it
in
every
sort
of
product
day
in
and
day
out?
they
have
no
timidity
about
taking
it
on
and
you're
talking
about
other
potential
entrants,
what
about
the
large
chain
supermarkets?
each
of
them
has
their
private
brands
of
liquid
bleach.
now,
in
liquid
bleach,
would
they
compete
with
procter
in
practically
every
product
which
it
manufactures
and
distributes?
and
many
of
them
were
institutions,
so
much
a
larger
size
than
procter.
why
should
they
be
deterred
by
these?
and
a
few,
i
suppose
i
want
to
press
these
assumptions,
why
isn't
it
equally
reasonable
to
say
that
the
very
fact
that
procter
now
is
in
this
business
might
well
be
an
incentive
to
its
competitors
in
other
lines
to
enter
as
well?
i
--
i
do
not
advance
that
that.
i
simply
state
that
if
we're
talking
about
this
sort
of
assumption
in
respect
of
potential
entry
that
then
something
more
than
the
assumptions
which
are
indulged
in
here
should
be
required
on
this
record.
i
also
point
to
the
fact
that
on
this
question
of
size
and
the
alleged
advantages
that
might
flow
from
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
as
well
said
that
clorox
was
financially
self-sufficient.
it
said
that
it
was
enabled
financially
to
engage
in
any
advertising
or
promotional
projects
within
the
bounds
of
responsible
business
schedule.
the
same
applies
to
any
engagement
in
competitive
--
competitive
contest
with
others
and
i
just
touched
upon
that
in
terms
of
the
solicitor
general's
reference
to
a
competitive
encounter
in
pure
--
in
erie,
pennsylvania.
the
lone
example
in
a
--
of
record
of
--
and
--
and
approached
on
the
part
of
purex,
the
second
largest
company
to
enter
the
erie,
pennsylvania
market
where
procter
--
where
clorox
was
also
engaged
in
business.
well,
now
above
all
that
was
that
even
the
short
space
of
two
months,
purex
--
purex
went
in
to
this
market
and
captured
35%.
the
clorox
of
course
responded
and
it
engaged
in
extra
advertising,
some
extra
promotion,
and
--
and
the
net
result
of
it
was
that
it
captured
its
--
recaptured
its
share.
purex
share
went
down
from
this
35%
it
originally
achieved
to
some
7%.
but
this
is
a
type
of
competitive
encounter
which
is
the
essence
of
competition
i
maintain
and
that's
particularly
so
because
not
even
the
government
here
has
said
that
this
was
in
any
way
related
to
procter's
acquisition
or
that
any
funds
were
necessary
to
supplement
clorox's
financial
resources.
and
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
this
is
simply
a
--
an
incident
in
which
clorox
on
its
own
undoubtedly
would
have
responded
as
it
did
in
this
period
of
a
couple
of
short
months
after
the
acquisition.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
result
undoubtedly
would've
been
the
same.”
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i'm
--
i'm
glad
your
brought
that
up.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i'm
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i'm
--
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
out
because
on
this
record
and
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
--
there
is
nothing
to
support
any
assumption
that
the
advertising
--
the
overall
advertising
engaged
in
by
clorox
would
be
affected
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
acquisition.
the
testimony
is
that
it
was
never
inhibited
by
any
lack
of
money
and
that
its
advertising
expenditures
were
tied
simply
to
the
business
like
proposition
of
the
maximum
amount
to
expend
to
securely
optimum
return.
and
that
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
with
or
without
procter's
resources,
there
is
anything
which
would
--
which
would
require
or
which
would
encourage
or
cause
the
people
in
charge
of
the
clorox
business
before
or
after
to
be
affected
in
any
way
by
some
availability
of
additional
money
in
--
in
any
realistic
business
sense
that
isn't
the
test.
and
i
don't
think
that
in
--
in
line
with
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
could
be
foreseeable
that
any
competitors,
large
or
small,
would
be
in
anyway
adversely
affected
by
this
substitution.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
there
is
no
evidence,
your
honor,
in
respect
of
that
particularly
in
terms
of
these
small
concerns
that
you
have
mentioned.
and
certainly,
the
--
you're
right,
the
evidence
is
that
the
larger
part
--
the
great
majority
of
--
of
this
200
producers
are
what
--
what
you
would
call
relatively
small
companies
in
terms
of
total
assets.
but
i
--
i
--
point
out
to
you
that
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
this
business
is
that
it's
a
regionally
oriented
business.
the
--
as
the
solicitor
general
said
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
product
are
required
in
that
way.
and
in
these
regional
areas,
the
evidence
is
that
the
cost
of
entry
as
the
government
concedes,
on
a
regional
basis
is
low
and
yet
i
know
of
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
shows
that
since
the
acquisition,
any
new
entrant,
large
or
small,
has
come
in
to
the
business.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
--
i'd
answer
that
in
two
ways.first,
is
to
this
--
this
letter
point,
the
fact
that
you
--
you
referring
to
this
as
an
expert
judgment
by
the
commission.
let
me
say
that
there
is
in
the
briefs
here,
the
government
makes
no
--
puts
no
reliance
upon
this
so-called
element
of
expertise,
but
assuming
as
--
as
you
say
that
--
that
this
was
involved.
you
certainly
have
said
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
understand.
but
you
--
you
have
said
in
consolidated
foods,
for
example,
that
this
sort
of
commission
expertise
must
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
it
can't
be
just
a
guess
and
the
one
--
one
earlier
question
you
asked,
justice
harlan,
which
bears
upon
this
very
point,
isn't
to
inquire
it
about
this
--
what
is
going
on
in
the
commission.
the
first
commission,
when
it
got
this,
it
said
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
would
not
support
a
finding
of
illegality,
and
there
was
in
that
record
this
erie
incident
in
the
comet
business
and
what
have
you.
and
it
said
that
it
could
dismiss
the
complaint
rather
it
decided
to
remand
it.
but
the
point
that
i
make
here
is
that
after
the
remand,
this
matter
came
up
to
the
commission
on
a
second
opinion.
and
they've
been
--
that
group
of
commissioners
rejected
the
decision
of
the
first
and
held
that
the
--
that
the
act
have
been
violated.
but
it
was
on
the
same
record
that
the
first
commission
utilized
because
of
the
determination
by
the
second
commission
that
the
very
evidence
which
had
--
instructed
be
put
in
on
the
remand
was
needlessly
in
the
record
and
it
had
no
place
in
its
consideration.
and
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
error
and
the
other
aspect
of
it
is
that
where
you
have
some
question
of
commission
expertise
and
you
have
two
groups
of
commissioners
in
the
diametrically
--
having
diametrically
opposed
conclusions,
seemed
to
me
than
any
matter
of
a
consensus
of
expertise
pretty
well
goes
out
the
window.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
oh,
i
think
you
have
to
decide
this
case
in
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
about
the
commission's
second
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
it
--
it
said
it
wasn't
bound
by
either.
it
--
it
took
up.
it
--
it
tested
the
case
in
the
light
of
the
second
commission's
decision,
tested
entirely
on
that.but
it
said,
here,
we
cannot
ignore
the
fact
when
we're
talking
about
probabilities
and
things
of
that
nature
that
the
first
commission
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
(inaudible)
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
think
it
was
judging
the
--
the
decision
of
the
second
commission
taking
into
account
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
yes,
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
another
group
of
commissioners
had
decided
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
same
record
to
support
a
finding
of
illegality.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
and
i
--
i
share
your
reaction
to
that.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
no,
i
think
not.and
i
think
commissioner
elman
was
touching
all
bases
in
that
prolix
opinion
up
here
in
terms
of
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
prolix
anyway.
i
think
he
--
he
was
saying
that
the
commission
would
like
to
have
some
easier
way
to
get
its
hands
on
these
conglomerate
acquisitions.
and
i
say
despite
that
objective
and
that
desire
that
the
--
there's
nothing
that
i
read
here
--
read
in
your
decisions
which
indicates
that
the
statute
says
that
or
which
indicates
that
there
should
be
any
relaxation
of
the
basic
requirement
that
substantial
evidence
must
be
produced
to
establish
a
violation.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
think
it's
posed.
i
would
now
like
the
event
that
my
partner,
mr.
royall,
who
will
use
up
the
remainder
of
our
time
in
terms
of
some
of
these
--
the
aspects
of
this
post
acquisition.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
may
it
please
the
court.
the
presentation
here
of
the
distinguished
solicitor
general,
certainly
points
up
that
in
this
situation
certainly
the
federal
trade
commission
inveighs
against
the
size
of
these
acquiring
companies
and
indeed
as
i
gather
from
the
presentation,
there
is
the
feeling
here
that
in
some
way
or
other
in
these
conglomerate
merger
situations
that
the
commission
should
have
some
easier
way
to
get
its
hands
on
them
rather
than
the
standards
which
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
now,
of
course,
this
emphasis
upon
the
size
of
procter,
of
course,
the
emphasis
on
the
size
of
clorox
in
its
relatively
small
industry,
there
is
no
dispute
about
these
factors.
the
whole
point
is
whether
if
this
conglomerate
merger,
a
merger
in
which
there
has
been
no
elimination
of
a
competitor,
in
which
there
has
been
no
concentration
brought
about
in
the
market,
whether
on
the
basis
of
assumptions
related
solely
to
the
size
of
these
two
companies,
section
7
has
been
violated.
i
respectfully
say,
your
honor,
that
is
to
each,
thank
you.
i
respectfully
say
that
is
to
each
of
your
decisions
in
this
merger
field
you
have
held
the
government
properly
so
to
the
birth
of
establishing
that
a
probable
lessening
of
competition
would
be
caused
by
the
merger.
you
upheld
them
to
that
standard
not
on
the
basis
that
some
assumptions
can
be
a
substitute
for
evidence
or
on
the
basis
that
speculation
here
can
supplant
a
lack
a
proof.
and
i
turn
here
to
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
for
that
is
what
you
have
for
reviewing.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
approach
to
the
issues
which
were
raised
before
it.
well,
on
the
face
of
the
court's
opinion,
of
course,
there
is
reflected
a
conscientious
and
thorough
examination
of
this
record.
you
have
the
decision
of
this
tribunal,
its
considered
judgment
that
in
this
area
which
you
have
said
time
and
again
is
particularly
within
the
competence
of
the
court
of
appeals,
an
area
in
which
you
said
--
have
said
that
the
congress
entrusted
the
responsibility
of
reviewing
these
decisions
that
here,
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
an
exhaustive
examination
of
a
record
to
the
point
where
there
is
not
even
a
claim
here
that
in
anyway
its
review
was
inadequate.
and
now
the
solicitor
general
has
said
this
morning,
“but
the
trouble
is
that
it
did
not
understand
the
government's
theories,
the
reliance
of
the
government
upon
the
points
which
he
is
accented.”
but
this
is
--
this
does
not
come
through.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
misconception
about
the
government's
theories
of
illegality,
rather
it
tested
and
it
--
it
examined,
it
reaccepted
each
one
of
them.
it
examined
into
the
record
and
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
warrant
their
applicant
in
this
case
and
turning
to
that.
i
first
go
to
this
theory
of
illegality
which
the
solicitor
general
has
discussed
namely
that
procter
itself
was
a
potential
competitor
in
this
liquid
bleach
industry.
to
that
point,
your
honors,
has
had
a
very
strange
genesis.
no
such
claim
was
advanced
in
the
complaint
in
this
action.
at
no
time
during
the
lengthy
trial
proceedings
was
any
such
point
either
urged
or
was
any
indication
given
that
the
commission
was
relying
upon
any
such
contention.
indeed,
it
was
not
until
long
after
the
record
was
closed
in
the
course
of
a
second
appeal
to
the
commission
when
it
sua
sponte
for
the
first
time
gave
voice
to
this
theory.
the
result
has
been
that
it
has
attempted
to
extract
from
a
barren
record
some
evidence
to
support
this
claim
of
procter's
status
as
an
independent
entrant.
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
what
he
said
were
two
memoranda.
well
i
say
that
there
is
not
--
that
no
one
can
extract
from
either
one
of
these
the
slightest
indication
that
procter
on
its
own
had
any
interest
in
going
into
this
liquid
bleach
industry.
the
stockholders
of
the
clorox
company
initiated
this
acquisition
entirely
on
their
own.
these
men
had
their
life
work
in
this
--
their
ownership
of
this
business
by
reason
of
age
and
health,
they
were
just
--
just
had
to
get
out
of
the
operations.
and
it
was
their
desire
to
sell
their
interest
to
or
to
exchange
their
interest
for
the
marketable
securities
of
a
large
company
to
give
some
element
of
liquidity
to
their
estates.
so
procter
was
approached.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
no,
sir.
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
was
held
closely
by
the
great
majority
of
the
stock
being
held
by
the
management
executives
in
the
company.
now,
up
to
the
time
of
the
first
(inaudible)
that
were
made
to
procter
by
these
stockholders,
there
is
not
a
hint,
not
a
suggestion
in
this
record
that
procter
had
any
interest
whatsoever
in
investing
its
money
an
independent
entry
into
this
relatively
small
industry.
the
negotiations
which
ensued
occasioned
the
only
piece
of
paper
which
refers
in
any
way
to
independent
entry.
what
was
that?
it
was
a
memorandum
prepared
by
an
employee
in
procter's
promotion
department
analyzing
the
reasonableness
of
the
price
which
the
clorox
stockholders
were
asking
for
their
stock.
and
in
connection
with
that
analysis,
he
engaged
in
an
estimate
of
what
the
cost
of
independent
entry
might
be.
on
its
face,
the
memorandum
shows
that
it
had
no
other
purpose
that
it
reflected
in
no
way
any
thought
that
procter
would
go
into
the
business.
but
what
is
even
more
significant
about
this
piece
of
paper,
about
which
the
solicitor
general
has
thought
is
that
on
the
face
of
it,
contains
the
flat
unequivocal
recommendation
that
procter
not
go
into
this
business
on
its
own.
and
so
we
have
here
the
paradox
of
the
one
piece
of
paper
that
talks
about
this
subject
in
any
way,
incidental
or
otherwise,
contains
a
recommendation
that
procter
not
engage
in
the
business.
now,
the
second
thing
about
this
is
that
of
course,
there
isn't
the
word
testament
in
this
record
on
this
subject.
the
officials
of
procter
testified
at
length.
not
a
single
question
was
ever
addressed
to
them,
bore
in
any
way
upon
this
point
and
the
net
result
of
it
all
was
of
course
that
they
had
no
opportunity
to
demonstrate,
to
demonstrate
why
it
was
that
independent
entry
into
this
sort
of
a
business
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
company.
and
i
come
to
the
point
that
you
have
said,
your
honors,
in
your
last
decision
dealing
with
this
point
of
potential
entry
that
it
must
be
established
by
some
evidence
in
the
record,
and
i
would
just
point
up
the
bareness
of
this
record
by
contrasting
it
with
what
you
had
before
you
in
the
panel
and
case
where
there
you
pointed
out
that
each
of
the
joint
ventures
there
had
evidenced,
a
long
sustained
and
strong
interest
in
entering
the
market.
also,
you
pointed
out
that
each
of
those
companies
had
compelling
reasons
for
entering
the
market.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
any
such
self
evidence
here.
you
also
noted
that
the
industry
was
rapidly
expanding
in
terms
of
new
markets
and
new
uses
for
the
product.
but
here,
there
is
not
the
slightest
showing
that
any
such
conditions
existed
and
indeed
the
evidence
here
is
not
that
the
existing
facilities
were
not
adequate
to
supply
actual
and
prospective
demands,
but
that
it
is
exactly
to
the
contract.
and
also
in
the
panel
and
your
honors,
it
was
said
that
the
record
showed
that
each
of
the
ventures
could
have
gone
into
the
market
at
a
reasonable
profit.
the
only
thing
remotely
touching
on
that
factor
here
is
the
testimony
that
liquid
bleach
was
a
low
profit
product
with
no
showing,
respecting
any
profit
potential
which
would
attract
new
entries.
i
say
that
these
are
the
factors
which
would
be
your
significance
to
any
businessman
in
any
realistic
way
in
determining
whether
he
would
invest
his
money
in
entry
into
a
new
product
market.
yet
contrary
to
what
you
add
in
panel
and
there's
not
even
a
barebones
of
any
such
showing
here
and
yet
there
it
was
held
that
the
evidence
was
not
conclusive
that
each
of
the
joint
ventures
would
have
entered
on
its
own
and
you
remanded
the
case.
now,
respecting
this
whole
point
of
procter
as
a
potential
entry
i
maintain
and
respectively
suggest
that
on
this
record,
considering
the
origin
of
all
these,
considering
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
but
sheer
assumption
that
because
--
because
procter
is
a
multi-product
company
and
because
liquid
bleach
is
used
in
washing
machines
and
sold
through
supermarkets,
the
government
and
on
this
alone
is
(inaudible)
that
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
potential
entrant.
they
say
the
record
will
support
no
such
theory,
no
such
conclusion.
the
court
of
appeals
carefully
looked
into
all
these
evidence.
it
said
in
respect
of
evidence,
not
theories.
it
said
in
respect
of
evidence
no
less
than
four
times
that
on
the
record
here
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
procter
had
any
intention
of
going
into
the
business
and
nothing
to
show
any
probability
that
it
might
have
done
so.
now,
you
have
the
other
prong
of
this
argument
which
was
somewhat
likely
touched
on
this
morning
that
regardless
of
whether
procter
really
would
have
gone
into
the
business
regardless
of
the
evidence
on
that
point
that
some
significance
attaches
to
what
clorox
would
have
thought
procter
might
have
done.
and
hence,
the
theory
goes
that
regardless
of
a
--
any
likelihood,
clorox
must
have
been
--
must
have
feared
procter
as
a
potential
entrant
and
hence
administered
its
pricing
policies
in
the
light
of
that
concern.
well
as
to
that,
i
can
simply
observe
what
i
have
said
about
the
utter
lack
of
anything
here
to
indicate
why
procter
might
have
gone
into
this
particular
industry.
i
say
that
any
imaginary
psychological
concern
by
the
clorox
management
in
that
direction
would
have
been
both
irrational
and
illogic.
and
i
maintain
that
on
this
aspect
of
the
government's
theory
of
illegality,
there
is
just
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
it
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
rejected.
before
leaving
this
point
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
i
need
not
labor
here
the
extent
or
reliance
of
the
respondent
on
the
significance
of
that
decision,
the
significance
of
it
in
the
light
of
the
principles
which
this
court
expressed
in
the
universal
camera.
i
say
that
on
--
in
this
particular
setting,
where
this
decision
below
rest
entirely
upon
the
determination
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
conclusions
that
this
in
particular
is
a
case
which
calls
for
the
application
of
that
standard
of
review
which
your
honors
have
enunciated
being
one
in
which
the
court
will
not
intervene
to
set
aside
decisions
of
the
court
below
predicated
upon
--
on
the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
unless
there
is
the
rare
instance
of
a
gross
misapplication
or
gross
misapprehension
of
the
standards
of
review.
next,
your
honor,
is
i
like
to
talk
about
this
second
theory
of
illegality
the
solicitor
general
has
discussed.
this
is
the
proposition
that
regardless
of
all
else,
procter's
substitution
for
clorox
in
this
industry
will
have
such
substantial
deterrent
effects
upon
potential
competition
as
to
violate
the
statute.
now,
the
--
the
solicitor
general
gave
expression
to
the
certain
facets
of
the
post
acquisition
evidenced
here
which
lower
upon
conditions
in
the
industry
after
the
acquisition
occurred.
the
more
important
aspects
of
that,
i
maintain
go
to
the
question
upon
--
to
the
issue
in
respect
of
effects
upon
this
some
class
of
potential
competitors
where
the
government's
theory
as
premised
upon
its
assumptions
that
what
it
cause
competitive
advantages
which
would
stem
from
the
acquisition
would
be
of
such
significance
as
to
cause
other
people
who
might
have
come
in
to
stay
away.
well,
inline
with
this,
i
simply
note
that
as
to
some
of
these
other
factors
which
--
as
to
which
there
was
no
evidence,
the
commission
in
the
trial
proceedings
along
trial
proceedings
here,
examined
into
every
conceivable
advantage
which
it
could
dream
up
as
stemming
from
the
acquisition.
it
--
these
were
gone
into
hearings
--
hearings
throughout
the
country.
the
net
result
of
them
has
been
that
most
of
them
have
fallen
by
the
wayside.
they're
not
even
in
the
government's
briefs,
do
we
hear
anything
about.
and
in
that
respect,
i
was
somewhat
surprised
this
morning
that
i
heard
nothing
from
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
about
these
advantages
which
are
the
things
that
the
government
has
contended
are
going
to
keep
other
people
from
getting
into
this
business.
for
example,
regardless
of
all
the
time
put
into
it
in
the
trial
proceeding,
there
is
no
--
no
claim
here
that
there
were
any
advantages
in
production,
manufacture,
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
acquisition.
as
to
distribution,
the
government
does
talk
in
its
brief
about
procter's
large
sales
force
that
there
is
no
direct
claim
that
that
--
that
the
clorox
distribution
system
through
a
network
of
brokers
would
be
discontinued.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
none
and
that
there
was
no
reason
to
--
no
showing
as
to
why
it
would
be
of
an
advantage
anyway.
no
--
no
showing
here
that
by
reason
of
procter's
ownership,
there
would
be
some
more
easy
access
to
shelf
space.
or
is
there
anything
to
establish
that
any
knowhow
or
expertise
that
procter
would
augment
the
demonstrated
merchandising
abilities
of
clorox.
and
that
court
of
appeals
so
held
as
to
that
issue,
one
thing
which
has
been
emphasized
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
in
this
so-called
competitive
advantages.
it
is
a
matter
of
which
the
solicitor
general
has
not
adverted
as
yet.
yet
this
--
this
was
a
matter
which
the
government
has
said
in
its
briefs
represented
the
most
conspicuous
cost
advantage
which
could
be
a
tribute
of
the
acquisition.
and
that
was
this
matter
of
discounts
in
network
television.
the
government's
papers,
this
has
been
accented
then
exaggerated
as
the
one
thing
which
shows
that
this
substitution
of
procter
for
clorox
had
great
competitive
significance.
well,
i
can
understand
the
--
the
soft-pedaling
this
now.
in
the
first
place,
both
before
and
the
--
and
after
this
acquisition,
clorox
never
used
network
television.
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
discounts
or
available
funds
or
what
have
you.
simply
based
upon
the
decision
of
management,
the
clorox
advertising
agency
that
in
this
sort
of
a
regionally
oriented
business,
network
television
was
inappropriate
and
that
spot
television
was
the
only
thing
should
--
that
should
be
utilized.
and
it's
the
only
thing
that
ever
has
been
utilized
and
there's
nothing
to
show
that
there
is
any
reason
why
conditions
have
changed
or
would
change.
but
in
the
second,
as
to
this
most
commission
says
or
which
the
government
says
it's
the
most
conspicuous
cost
advantage.
the
circumstances
are
that
these
discounts
which
have
been
built
up
as
representing
tremendous
savings
or
potential
savings,
the
fact
is
that
the
discounts
have
either
been
completely
discontinued
by
this
time
or
being
discontinued
by
all
three
of
the
networks.
this
was
not
only
widely
publicized,
but
it
was
a
subject
of
testimony
before
senate
hearings
at
the
end
of
last
year,
the
same
hearings
which
the
government
refers
to
in
its
brief
and
in
which
the
--
all
of
the
representatives
of
all
networks
testified
that
this,
whatever
importance
they
have
was
a
thing
of
the
past.
i
can
understand
this
--
the
grant
of
the
government
been
resting
so
much
of
its
case
upon
these
discounts
as
has
been
done
in
its
brief
and
upon
its
contention
that
they
have
anti-competitive
significance.
and
i
say
that
particular
because
in
the
same
senate
hearings
at
which
this
network
representatives
testified
and
which
went
into
all
claims
about
discriminations
and
discounts
and
otherwise
in
advertising,
mr.
zimmerman,
the
acting
assistant
attorney
general
testified
and
he
testified
and
stated
he
was
testifying
four
of
the
antitrust
division.
his
comments
respecting
these
advertising
discounts
which
have
been
so
built
up
here
as
well
as
other
forms
of
so-called
discriminations.
his
testimony
was,
i
quote,
“we
do
not
know
to
what
extent
if
at
all
these
forms
of
discrimination
exist
nor
do
we
know
how
serious
an
impact
they
might
have.”
he
concluded
with
the
colorful
observation.
we
have
no
view
one
way
or
the
other
on
whether
we
have
an
octopus
or
a
pussy
cat
here.
and
i
say
that
the
anomalous
or
any
judgment
to
be
predicated
in
any
respect
upon
either
the
substantiality
or
the
likelihood
or
any
effects
resulting
from
what
are
now
these
non-existent
discounts.
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
probably
touched
upon
the
decisive
intention
of
the
government
here
when
he
alluded
to
procter's
size
to
its
success
in
connection
with
various
products
to
its
large
expenditures
for
advertising.
of
course,
i
simply
say
in
passing
as
to
this
millions
that
said
procter
spends
because
this
overlooks
completely
the
realism
that
these
advertising
expenditures
had
to
support
some
30
or
more
major
products.
and
on
the
government's
own
--
on
the
face
of
the
government's
brief,
it
appears
that
the
average
expenditure
for
each
of
these
procter
products
were
substantially
less
--
substantially
less
than
clorox
spent
in
the
year
before
the
acquisition
for
advertising
and
promotion.
and
the
solicitor
general
also
made
reference
to
another
procter
product
commenting
which
he
said
was
introduced
by
procter
and
achieved
widespread
acceptance.
but
the
implication
that
i
got
from
this
recital
was
that
procter's
spending
of
some
$7
million
within
a
22
months
period
to
launch
this
new
and
improved,
demonstrably
improved
product
that
in
somehow
or
other
this
reflected
--
had
some
sinister
significance.
but
the
fact
of
the
mater
is
that
in
that
same
22
months
period
as
the
record
here
shows,
clorox
chemical
company
on
its
own
before
the
acquisition
had
spent
more
than
that
in
the
advertising
of
the
established
clorox
product
and
where
no
extensive
introductory
expenses
were
required.
i
say
that
these
--
these
references
to
events
like
this
without
some
indication
of
why
they
are
significant
or
important
or
fit
into
this
whole
line
of
assumptions
by
the
government,
the
just
as
meetings
and
that
you're
down
to
--
i
started
to
say,
this
point
that
by
reason
of
procter's
size
just
it's
--
it's
the
abstract
point
of
it
being
a
--
a
big
company
that
somebody,
some
potential
competitor
would
be
scared
of
and
not
come
in.
this
assumption
the
government
is
--
is
presenting
here,
and
that
is
all
it
is.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
did
not
attribute
that
to
him.
no,
sir,
i
say
that
in
--
on
analysis,
that
is
what
the
government's
contention
comes
down
to
and
i
recognize
that
he
just
claimed
that.
it
has
been
disclaimed
here.
but
your
honor
i
--
i
say
that
on
a
record
such
as
this
where
we're
talking
about
something
supported
by
substantial
evidence
not
by
some
visceral
reaction
as
to
how
somebody
might
--
psychological
reactions
of
some
possible
entry.
on
this
--
on
this
record,
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
it
is
anything
but
procter's
size.
now,
at
some
other
records,
some
other
case
that
this
is
--
this
may
have
a
different
import
but
the
--
the
--
in
any
--
in
phrasing
through
with
that,
the
government
recognized
that
it
could
not
simply
leave
this
class
of
supposititious
possible
entrance
hanging
in
a
vacuum.
it
purported
to
give
some
identification
to
that
and
it
said
that
they
might
be
large
multi
product
companies
like
colgate
or
lever
brothers
or
general
food.
and
of
course
there
isn't
a
word
in
this
record
which
supports
any
deep
such
deduction
or
any
word
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
these
companies
or
anybody
else
might
be
interested
or
attracted
to
going
into
this
business
on
their
own.
but
even
if
you
want
to
indulge
in
those
assumptions,
i
say
why
would
any
of
these
companies
be
deterred
by
procter's
substitution?
are
they
competing
with
it
in
every
sort
of
product
day
in
and
day
out?
they
have
no
timidity
about
taking
it
on
and
you're
talking
about
other
potential
entrants,
what
about
the
large
chain
supermarkets?
each
of
them
has
their
private
brands
of
liquid
bleach.
now,
in
liquid
bleach,
would
they
compete
with
procter
in
practically
every
product
which
it
manufactures
and
distributes?
and
many
of
them
were
institutions,
so
much
a
larger
size
than
procter.
why
should
they
be
deterred
by
these?
and
a
few,
i
suppose
i
want
to
press
these
assumptions,
why
isn't
it
equally
reasonable
to
say
that
the
very
fact
that
procter
now
is
in
this
business
might
well
be
an
incentive
to
its
competitors
in
other
lines
to
enter
as
well?
i
--
i
do
not
advance
that
that.
i
simply
state
that
if
we're
talking
about
this
sort
of
assumption
in
respect
of
potential
entry
that
then
something
more
than
the
assumptions
which
are
indulged
in
here
should
be
required
on
this
record.
i
also
point
to
the
fact
that
on
this
question
of
size
and
the
alleged
advantages
that
might
flow
from
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
as
well
said
that
clorox
was
financially
self-sufficient.
it
said
that
it
was
enabled
financially
to
engage
in
any
advertising
or
promotional
projects
within
the
bounds
of
responsible
business
schedule.
the
same
applies
to
any
engagement
in
competitive
--
competitive
contest
with
others
and
i
just
touched
upon
that
in
terms
of
the
solicitor
general's
reference
to
a
competitive
encounter
in
pure
--
in
erie,
pennsylvania.
the
lone
example
in
a
--
of
record
of
--
and
--
and
approached
on
the
part
of
purex,
the
second
largest
company
to
enter
the
erie,
pennsylvania
market
where
procter
--
where
clorox
was
also
engaged
in
business.
well,
now
above
all
that
was
that
even
the
short
space
of
two
months,
purex
--
purex
went
in
to
this
market
and
captured
35%.
the
clorox
of
course
responded
and
it
engaged
in
extra
advertising,
some
extra
promotion,
and
--
and
the
net
result
of
it
was
that
it
captured
its
--
recaptured
its
share.
purex
share
went
down
from
this
35%
it
originally
achieved
to
some
7%.
but
this
is
a
type
of
competitive
encounter
which
is
the
essence
of
competition
i
maintain
and
that's
particularly
so
because
not
even
the
government
here
has
said
that
this
was
in
any
way
related
to
procter's
acquisition
or
that
any
funds
were
necessary
to
supplement
clorox's
financial
resources.
and
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
this
is
simply
a
--
an
incident
in
which
clorox
on
its
own
undoubtedly
would
have
responded
as
it
did
in
this
period
of
a
couple
of
short
months
after
the
acquisition.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
result
undoubtedly
would've
been
the
same.”
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i'm
--
i'm
glad
your
brought
that
up.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i'm
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i'm
--
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
out
because
on
this
record
and
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
--
there
is
nothing
to
support
any
assumption
that
the
advertising
--
the
overall
advertising
engaged
in
by
clorox
would
be
affected
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
acquisition.
the
testimony
is
that
it
was
never
inhibited
by
any
lack
of
money
and
that
its
advertising
expenditures
were
tied
simply
to
the
business
like
proposition
of
the
maximum
amount
to
expend
to
securely
optimum
return.
and
that
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
with
or
without
procter's
resources,
there
is
anything
which
would
--
which
would
require
or
which
would
encourage
or
cause
the
people
in
charge
of
the
clorox
business
before
or
after
to
be
affected
in
any
way
by
some
availability
of
additional
money
in
--
in
any
realistic
business
sense
that
isn't
the
test.
and
i
don't
think
that
in
--
in
line
with
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
could
be
foreseeable
that
any
competitors,
large
or
small,
would
be
in
anyway
adversely
affected
by
this
substitution.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
there
is
no
evidence,
your
honor,
in
respect
of
that
particularly
in
terms
of
these
small
concerns
that
you
have
mentioned.
and
certainly,
the
--
you're
right,
the
evidence
is
that
the
larger
part
--
the
great
majority
of
--
of
this
200
producers
are
what
--
what
you
would
call
relatively
small
companies
in
terms
of
total
assets.
but
i
--
i
--
point
out
to
you
that
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
this
business
is
that
it's
a
regionally
oriented
business.
the
--
as
the
solicitor
general
said
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
product
are
required
in
that
way.
and
in
these
regional
areas,
the
evidence
is
that
the
cost
of
entry
as
the
government
concedes,
on
a
regional
basis
is
low
and
yet
i
know
of
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
shows
that
since
the
acquisition,
any
new
entrant,
large
or
small,
has
come
in
to
the
business.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
--
i'd
answer
that
in
two
ways.first,
is
to
this
--
this
letter
point,
the
fact
that
you
--
you
referring
to
this
as
an
expert
judgment
by
the
commission.
let
me
say
that
there
is
in
the
briefs
here,
the
government
makes
no
--
puts
no
reliance
upon
this
so-called
element
of
expertise,
but
assuming
as
--
as
you
say
that
--
that
this
was
involved.
you
certainly
have
said
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
understand.
but
you
--
you
have
said
in
consolidated
foods,
for
example,
that
this
sort
of
commission
expertise
must
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
it
can't
be
just
a
guess
and
the
one
--
one
earlier
question
you
asked,
justice
harlan,
which
bears
upon
this
very
point,
isn't
to
inquire
it
about
this
--
what
is
going
on
in
the
commission.
the
first
commission,
when
it
got
this,
it
said
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
would
not
support
a
finding
of
illegality,
and
there
was
in
that
record
this
erie
incident
in
the
comet
business
and
what
have
you.
and
it
said
that
it
could
dismiss
the
complaint
rather
it
decided
to
remand
it.
but
the
point
that
i
make
here
is
that
after
the
remand,
this
matter
came
up
to
the
commission
on
a
second
opinion.
and
they've
been
--
that
group
of
commissioners
rejected
the
decision
of
the
first
and
held
that
the
--
that
the
act
have
been
violated.
but
it
was
on
the
same
record
that
the
first
commission
utilized
because
of
the
determination
by
the
second
commission
that
the
very
evidence
which
had
--
instructed
be
put
in
on
the
remand
was
needlessly
in
the
record
and
it
had
no
place
in
its
consideration.
and
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
error
and
the
other
aspect
of
it
is
that
where
you
have
some
question
of
commission
expertise
and
you
have
two
groups
of
commissioners
in
the
diametrically
--
having
diametrically
opposed
conclusions,
seemed
to
me
than
any
matter
of
a
consensus
of
expertise
pretty
well
goes
out
the
window.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
oh,
i
think
you
have
to
decide
this
case
in
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
about
the
commission's
second
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
it
--
it
said
it
wasn't
bound
by
either.
it
--
it
took
up.
it
--
it
tested
the
case
in
the
light
of
the
second
commission's
decision,
tested
entirely
on
that.but
it
said,
here,
we
cannot
ignore
the
fact
when
we're
talking
about
probabilities
and
things
of
that
nature
that
the
first
commission
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
(inaudible)
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
think
it
was
judging
the
--
the
decision
of
the
second
commission
taking
into
account
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
yes,
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
another
group
of
commissioners
had
decided
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
same
record
to
support
a
finding
of
illegality.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
and
i
--
i
share
your
reaction
to
that.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
no,
i
think
not.and
i
think
commissioner
elman
was
touching
all
bases
in
that
prolix
opinion
up
here
in
terms
of
--
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
well,
prolix
anyway.
i
think
he
--
he
was
saying
that
the
commission
would
like
to
have
some
easier
way
to
get
its
hands
on
these
conglomerate
acquisitions.
and
i
say
despite
that
objective
and
that
desire
that
the
--
there's
nothing
that
i
read
here
--
read
in
your
decisions
which
indicates
that
the
statute
says
that
or
which
indicates
that
there
should
be
any
relaxation
of
the
basic
requirement
that
substantial
evidence
must
be
produced
to
establish
a
violation.
mr.
frederick
w.
r.
pride
i
think
it's
posed.
i
would
now
like
the
event
that
my
partner,
mr.
royall,
who
will
use
up
the
remainder
of
our
time
in
terms
of
some
of
these
--
the
aspects
of
this
post
acquisition.
