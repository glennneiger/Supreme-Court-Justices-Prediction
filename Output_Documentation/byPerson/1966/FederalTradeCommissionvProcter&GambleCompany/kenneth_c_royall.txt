the
matter
we
are
undertaking
to
determine
now
has
this
aspect
which
should
be
called
it
seems
to
me
to
the
attention
of
everyone.
the
validity
of
this
merger
is
due
--
is
dependent
upon
in
large
effect
--
in
the
large
extent
and
perhaps
primarily
and
finally
in
whether
or
not
there
was
injury
to
anyone
in
connection
with
this
case.
situation
is
that,
12
years
ago,
the
aging
owners
of
clorox
chemical
sought
to
sell
their
business
and
to
realize
on
the
long
investment.
age
and
deterioration
was
the
compelling
motive.
finally,
after
discussion
with
several
companies,
a
sale
was
made
to
procter
&
gamble
in
1957.
the
sale
was
public
and
open
and
available
before
it
was
made
and
after
it
was
made
throughout
the
industries
near
to
or
up
to
this
claim.
the
federal
trade
commission
attacked
the
acquisition
and
the
uncontested
--
and
on
the
other
hand
the
uncontested
and
incontestable
figure
showed
that
in
the
post-merger
period,
competitors
of
clorox
have
sold
more
bleach
for
more
money
than
they
ever
did
before
the
acquisition.
and
then,
the
mutually
agreed
statistics,
not
picked
statistics,
the
figure
show
that
the
competitors
of
clorox,
those
who
are
competing
with
them
day
by
day
have
sold
$200
million
more
--
200
million
more
units
and
received
$45
million
more
than
before
the
merger.
our
position
is
even
stronger
in
the
last
year
for
which
this
share
of
dollar
is
available.
the
competitors
sold
more
bleach
than
the
competitors,
our
competitors
--
people
fighting
us,
sold
more
bleach
that
ever
before
in
their
history.
what
the
government
wishes
to
do
is
to
ignore
this
evidence
and
to
substitute
guesses
and
hunches
that
as
a
future
--
to
determine
the
future
of
the
industry,
but
there
is
no
record
to
justify
that
approach.
the
commission
itself,
when
it
first
reviewed
this
record,
remanded
the
proceedings
as
has
been
mentioned.
in
his
own
words,
it
held
that
such
guesses
and
hunches
were
nothing
more
than
treacherous
conjecture.
that's
what
the
commission
said.
the
remand
was
designed
to
give
the
government
a
second
chance
to
prove
the
case
that
had
been
lost.
but
even
then,
the
government
brought
in
no
witnesses
and
no
competitor
of
clorox
was
called
to
testify.
another
one,
yet
these
witnesses
--
these
were
the
witnesses
who
could
best
tell
the
situation
after
the
acquisition
or
be
told
nothing
and
they
claim
that
they
were
fully
familiar
with
the
bleach
industry
and
they
were
all
well
known
to
the
commission.
if
there
had
been
an
iota
of
substance
in
the
government's
claim,
these
competitors
would
have
been
called
and
testified
and
they
were
not.
not
one
of
them
was
summoned.
their
absence
tells
its
own
story.
indeed
in
this
whole
case,
no
competitor
of
clorox
testified
that
he
had
lost
a
single
customer,
the
competitors
not
--
they
not
testified
they
lost
a
single
customer.
or
their
business
had
been
adversely
affected
in
any
way
by
this
acquisition
and
those
are
the
facts
i
cannot
begin
to
say.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
what?
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
let
me
just
select
one.
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proofing
the
substantial
evidence
that
as
the
result
of
this
acquisition
competition
may
be
lessened
in
the
liquid
bleach
industry.
there
is
no
such
truth
in
any
part
of
the
record.
