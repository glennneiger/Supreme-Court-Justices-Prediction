mr.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
that
court,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
set
aside
the
federal
trade
commission's
order
that
procter
&
gamble
divest
itself
of
assets
from
the
clorox
chemical
company,
the
nation's
largest
bleach
manufacturer,
which
it
had
acquired
through
a
merger.
at
the
time
of
the
merger
in
1959
procter
&
gamble
was
among
the
nation's
50
largest
manufacturing
corporations.
it's
sales
in
1957
were
an
excess
of
$1
billion.
procter
&
gamble
is
a
large
diversified
manufacturer
of
low
price
rapid
turnover
household
products
sold
primarily
through
grocery,
drug,
and
department
stores.
its
annual
sales
of
soaps
and
detergents
in
kansas
alone,
products
very
similar
to
bleach
were
more
than
$500
million
in
1957,
for
example.
procter's
principal
products
are
marketing
to
housewives
largely
by
what
is
called
“pre-selling.”
by
pre-selling
it's
understood
to
mean
that
through
advertising
and
other
sales
promotions.data
in
1957,
procter
was
the
largest
advertiser
in
the
country,
spending
more
than
$80
million
on
advertising
and
an
additional
$47
million
in
promotions.
expenditures
on
advertising
substantially
greater
than
the
total
sales
of
the
two
leading
bleach
producers,
clorox
and
purex.
between
1946
and
1962,
product's
net
sales
increased
by
more
than
400%
which
shows
recent
rapid
growth
in
its
product
sales,
and
this
also
showed
a
rapid
diversification
into
new
product
lines
closely
related
to
its
existing
lines.
procter's
president
justified
that
approximately
70%
of
procter's
household
product
volume
came
from
products
not
even
in
existence
in
1946.
the
more
narrow
period
between
1952
and
1957,
procter's
sales
rose
some
40%.
a
substantial
part
of
that
growth
was
due
to
the
introduction
of
new
brands
and
product
lines
in
which
product
--
procter
has
not
previously
been
selling.
now,
as
to
the
clorox
company,
in
1957,
the
clorox
chemical
company
was
engaged
almost
exclusively
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
household
liquid
bleach.
with
13
plants
located
throughout
the
country,
clorox
was
the
only
truly
nationwide
manufacturer
and
seller
of
liquid
bleach.
it
accounted
for
48.8%
of
the
nation's
total
annual
sales
of
household
liquid
bleach,
and
in
some
regional
markets,
clorox's
sale
was
even
higher.
for
example,
the
mid-atlantic
states
where
clorox
had
72%
of
all
the
sales
of
liquid
bleach.
now,
what
is
liquid
bleach?
household
liquid
bleach
is
used
principally
as
a
whitener
in
the
cleansing
of
clothes,
cleaning
of
clothes
and
also
it's
used
as
a
germicide
and
disinfectant
at
times.
all
major
brands
of
liquid
bleach
are
chemically
identical,
a
solution
of
five-and-one-quarter
percent
sodium
high
chloride
in
water.
bleach
is
easily
manufactured
and
its
manufacture
involves
no
patents
and
no
trade
secrets,
and
it's
a
concentrated
industry.
the
bleach
industry,
despite
the
lack
of
technological
barriers
to
entry
remains
highly
concentrated.
two
firms,
clorox
with
48.8%
of
national
sales
and
the
purex
company
with
15.7%
accounted
in
1959
for
about
65%
of
the
total
sales
of
household
liquid
bleach.
six
firms
indeed
accounted
for
80%
of
all
of
the
sales.
the
remaining
20%
is
scattered
among
some
200
other
producers,
most
of
which
are
quite
small.
concentration
is
even
greater
on
a
local
or
regional
basis.
this
is
due
in
part
to
the
high
cost
of
transportation
of
bleach
in
relation
to
its
unit
price.
freight
averages
about
10%
of
the
cost.
thus,
it
is
generally
not
economical
for
a
manufacturer
to
sell
beyond
300
miles
of
its
plant.
so
as
i've
said,
only
clorox
has
enough
plants
at
various
locations
to
sell
throughout
the
country
and
to
be
nationwide
in
production.
even
purex,
the
second
ranking
seller,
distributes
its
bleach
in
only
one
half
of
the
nation.
the
result
is
that
the
shares
of
the
leading
producers
are
larger
in
particular
areas
than
the
national
figures
would
indicate.
for
example,
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
clorox
and
two
other
firms
had
97.8%
of
all
the
bleach
sales
in
metropolitan
chicago.
clorox
and
one
other
had
88%
of
the
southwest
region,
clorox
and
another
had
81%
of
the
pacific
market,
and
clorox
alone
has
70%
of
all
the
sales
in
the
mid-atlantic
states.
bleach
is
like
other
low
priced
rapid
turnover
household
items
heavily
pre-sold
by
the
manufacture
through
advertising.
for
example,
in
its
last
full
year
of
independent
operation,
clorox
spent
an
amount
equivalent
to
approximately
10%
of
its
annual
sales
for
advertising,
and
numerous
witnesses
testified
to
the
critical
importance
of
advertising
and
promotional
efforts
by
the
manufacturer
in
order
to
create
sufficient
demand
for
his
brand
and
to
entitle
it
to
sufficient
shelf
space
which
is
allocated
by
the
retailers
according
to
the
consumers'
demand.
thus,
this
case
involves
the
acquisition
of
the
nation's
dominant
liquid
bleach
producer
by
the
nation's
leading
manufacturer
of
other
household
products
closely
related
to
bleach
such
as
detergents,
soaps
and
cleansers
or
more
broadly
the
nation's
leading
manufacturers,
of
procter
&
gamble's
own
annual
report
in
56
and
57
states
quote.
“low
priced,
rapid
turnover,
household
items
sold
primarily
to
grocery,
drug
and
department
stores.”
because
of
the
functionally
related
product
lines
and
merger,
though
conglomerate
rather
than
horizontal
or
vertical,
was
aptly
described
by
the
commission
as
one
involving
product
extension
by
the
acquiring
firm
of
procter.
at
this
point,
i
would
not
like
to
recite
all
of
the
reasons
given
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission
which
led
the
commission
to
conclude
to
the
effect
of
the
merger
and
the
words
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
relevant
market
nor
shall
i
recite
in
detail
the
reasons
given
by
the
sixth
circuit
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
for
its
setting
aside
of
the
commission
order.
indeed,
in
this
case
procter
&
gamble
points
out
in
its
brief
the
full
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
to
be
as
follows,
the
procter
&
gamble
in
its
brief
says,
“the
division
of
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
predicated
upon
a
comprehensive
consideration
of
the
whole
record
in
this
case
turns
upon
one
ultimate
finding.”
the
court
said,
“considering
the
record
as
a
whole,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
decision
of
the
second
commission
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
it
is
partly
all
that
the
court
said.
mr.
marshall
not
exactly
the
other
way.
the
commission
in
its
original
decision
said
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
establish
that
this
will
be
the
substantial
tendency;
and
sent
it
back
for
a
hearing
as
to
what
had
happened
since
the
merger.
the
hearing
was
held.
the
commissioner
--
the
hearing
examiner
again
said
practically
the
same
thing
and
the
commission
in
its
second
opinion
held
that
it
was
not
bound
at
all
by
the
first
opinion.
it
was
not
the
law
of
the
case
and
indeed
the
law
had
changed
in
the
interim
by
the
brown
shoe
case
and
the
national
bank
case.
mr.
marshall
all
but
one.
but
i
submit,
sir,
that
under
recognized
administrative
law
it's
still
the
same
commission.
suffice
it
to
say
at
this
point
that
in
our
view
the
court
of
appeals
while
extensively
finding
the
order
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
in
fact,
actually,
disagreed
which
the
commission's
conclusion.
one,
by
substituting
its
own
conclusion
that
the
bleach
industry
was
competitive
for
the
commission's
finding
to
the
contrary,
and
two,
by
its
failure
to
properly
evaluate
the
economic
and
antitrust
implications
of
potential
competition
and
barriers
to
inquiry
of
new
firms
in
the
oligopolistic
industries.
now,
first
of
all
under
section
7
as
commissioner
elman
said
and
nobody
will
dispute
there
is
process
standard
as
to
where
you're
under
section
7
or
not.
but
there
are
certain
matters
that
are
recognized.
for
example,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
a
highly
concentrated
market
where
a
few
of
the
sellers
account
for
most
of
the
sales,
a
significant,
perhaps
insignificant
form
of
competitive
restraint
is
that
of
potential
competition.
the
treat
to
other
firms
outside
the
market
might
enter
if
the
conditions
within
the
market
such
as
the
setting
of
high
price
level
make
entry
attractive.
a
merger
then
which
eliminates
potential
competition
by
removing
a
likely
entrant
to
the
market
or
which
weakens
potential
competition
by
increasing
the
barriers
to
entry
into
the
market
may
each
thereby
violate
section
7.
with
these
general
propositions
i
don't
believe
there
can
be
much
dispute.
but
the
respondents
assert
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
the
commission
had
no
factually
adequate
basis
and,
hence,
no
legally
justifiable
reasons
for
concluding
that
procter's
acquisition
of
clorox
might
probably
impair
the
efficiency
of
potential
competition.
we
think
the
commission's
order
should
have
been
sustained.
and
as
for
these
reasons,
first,
the
commission
examined
in
detail
the
structure
of
the
household
liquid
bleach
market
and
it
found
that
two
items,
the
two
firms
accounted
for
65%
of
the
nation's
total
sales
and
it
found
that
in
some
section
of
the
country
the
share
of
one
firm,
usually
clorox,
approached
monopoly
proportions
and
that
in
other
sections
clorox
and
one
or
two
others
accounted
for
80%
of
the
sales
of
bleach.
the
commission
found
that
the
dominant
firm,
clorox,
was
a
recognized
price
leader
and
that
other
firms
almost
uniformly
followed
clorox's
lead
in
setting
prices.
thus,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
industry
was
highly
concentrated
and
oligopolistic.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
thought
that
the
evidence
did
not
establish
that
there
was
anything
unhealthy
about
the
market's
conditions.
and
in
making
this
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
unhealthy,
they
relied
on
o
nly
two
facts.
one
was
the
existence
of
a
fringe
of
some
200
producers
accounting
for
20%
of
the
nation
sales.
yet,
the
commission
had
specifically
noted
that
only
eight
fringe
manufacturers
had
assets
of
over
million
dollars
and
very
few
had
assets
of
more
than
$75,000.
plainly,
the
commission
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
existence
of
the
small
firms
gave
no
assurance
of
competition
within
the
industry,
especially
in
light
of
the
emphasis
in
the
industry
on
product
differentiation
through
mass
advertising.
the
second
part
relied
under
the
court
of
appeals,
was
its
conclusion
that
the
industry
was
healthy
and
that
point
was
that
after
merger,
after
the
merger,
producers
other
than
clorox
where
quote,
“were
selling
more
bleach
for
more
money
than
ever
before."
end
of
quote.
but
the
record
shows
that
clorox
in
the
same
period
increased
its
market
share
from
48.7%
to
52%.
in
short,
the
court
below
patently
erred
in
rejecting
the
commission's
conclusions
concerning
the
industry.
that
error
underlies
the
courts
failed
to
recognize
the
importance
of
the
potential
competition,
the
point
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
respondent
asserts
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
the
commission's
conclusion
with
respect
to
procter's
likely
entrant
and
with
respect
to
the
probe
competitive
effective
of
a
threat
of
entry
posed
by
this,
both
of
which
relate
to
potential
competition
are
unsupported
in
the
record.let
us
turn
to
the
evidence
on
potential
competition
and
the
inferences
drawn
there
from
--
by
the
commission.
procter's
history
of
expansion
and
diversification
through
product
extension,
the
functionally
closely
related
product
lines
and
the
true
intra-corporate
memoranda
of
the
procter
company
relating
to
the
bleach
industry
and
the
clorox
company.
now,
there
are
two
memoranda
in
the
record
in
which
in
the
first,
procter
said,
“procter's
experts
suggested
that
while
it
might
be
good
to
go
in
to
the
liquid
bleach
industry
it
would
not
be
profitable.
and
the
second
one,
urged
that
they
buy
clorox
providing
they
could
buy
it
for
$30
million
or
less.”
i
have
only
averted
to
the
evidence
on
the
first
two
points,
but
to
recapitulate
procter
had
a
history
of
expansion
and
diversification
in
the
industries
where
it
had
not
previously
sold.
some
of
the
expansion
was
internal
and
some
by
acquisition,
but
all
of
it
involved
the
same
items,
low
price,
rapid
turnover,
household
items,
functionally
related
to
similar
production,
distribution
or
marketing
techniques,
including
heavy
emphasis
on
product
differentiation
and
the
pre-selling
through
mass
advertising.
and
in
addition
procter
is
a
recognized
leader
in
the
field
of
soaps,
detergents
and
cleansers.
products
whose
function
in
relation
to
bleach
is
even
more
pronounced
because
of
similar
and
complimentary
uses.
procter
has
been
expanding
in
these
very
areas
steadily
and
its
strength
and
success
in
product
extension
is
demonstrated
as
the
commission
found
by
the
comet
abrasive
cleansing
campaign.
procter
introduced
comet
in
1957
at
a
time
when
colgate-palmolive's
brand
ajax
accounted
for
roughly
56%
of
the
sales
of
abrasive
cleansers.
in
the
course
of
22
months,
procter
spent
$7.2
million
on
advertising
and
promotional
activities
for
comet,
and
then
--
thereby
achieved
its
36.5%
of
the
market.
despite
this
evidence
of
procter's
expansion
by
product
extension
into
functionally
closely
related
product
lines,
the
court
of
appeals
discarded
this
conclusion
and
substituted
its
own
conclusions
as
follows,
quote,
“household
liquid
bleach
is
an
old
product.
procter
is
an
old
company.
if
procter
wants
to
bring
it,
it
is
a
prime
that
it
never
lost
its
balance
and
fell
in
during
the
many
years
in
which
such
bleach
was
on
the
market.”
while
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
procter's
expansion
into
industries
in
which
it
had
not
previously
sold,
the
commission
again
weighed
procter's
study
of
the
bleach
market
and
of
the
clorox
company
has
demonstrated
in
these
two
memoranda,
55
and
57,
and
we
discussed
that
evidence
in
our
brief
at
pages
17
and
19.
respondent,
however,
is
quite
correct
in
stating
that
the
recommendation
of
procter's
officials
was
at
that
time
against
independent
entry
through
internal
expansion.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
memorandum
shows
that
procter
considered
the
bleach
industry
and
had
recognized
that
no
one
should
doubt
that
the
market
was
complimentary
to
those
of
the
other
procter
products.
there
were
some
--
seldom
be
anymore
direct
evidence
that
a
firm
is
a
likely
entering
into
a
new
field.or
that
it
exercise
a
pro
competitive
influence
by
its
presence
on
the
fringe
of
the
market
beyond
what
we
have
here.
yet,
the
picture
is
not
quite
complete.
there
is
also
some
evidence
summarized
in
note
38
in
page
46
of
our
brief
that
for
example
a
small
firm
discontinued
to
manufacture
bleach
because
of
the
acquisition
of
clorox
by
procter.
all
of
this
evidence,
especially
in
light
of
the
commission's
detailed
analysis
of
the
market
structure,
we
think
it
clearly
shows
that
procter
presented
potential
competition
in
the
bleach
industry.
now,
to
another
aspect
of
the
merger,
the
merger
substituted
for
clorox
which
had
assets
of
$12
million
and
sales
of
$40
million,
the
procter
company
which
in
1957
had
sales
in
excess
of
a
billion
and
profits
of
more
than
$47
million.
more
strikingly,
however,
is
the
comparison
of
the
combined
procter
and
clorox
with
the
remaining
competitors
in
the
bleach
industry.
the
others
had
remaining
--
the
others
and
remaining
major
bleach
firm,
purex,
which
is
more
diversified
then
was
clorox
had
sales
in
a
year
prior
to
the
merger
totalling
5%
of
procter.
in
short,
procter
separately
grows
the
remaining
firms
in
the
industry
for
a
dominant
single
product
manufacture
of
bleach.
the
merger
substitutes
giant
multi
product
firm
dominant
in
several
product
lines
yet
respondent
procter
&
gamble
has
asserted
and
the
courts
of
appeals
recited
that
the
--
that
the
commission's
decision
condemn
big
business
per
se,
and
based
its
decision
on
procter's
size.
that
factual
argument
does
not
do
justice
to
the
commission's
careful
and
able
opinion
where
the
commission
over
and
over
again
made
its
position
quite
explicit.
for
example,
the
commission
said
it
should
be
very
clear
that
in
deeming
procter
size
a
pertinent
consideration
in
the
decision
of
this
case,
we
are
most
emphatically
not
adapting
any
view
that
big
business
per
se
is
anticompetitive
or
undesirable
and
should
be
attacked
under
section
7
or
any
other
antitrust
statute.
procter's
size
is
significant
in
this
case
only
insofar
as
it
is
huge
--
as
it
is
hugely
disparate
compared
with
the
size
of
the
firms
in
the
relevant
market.
“disparity
of
size
not
absolute
size
has
importance
in
a
merger
of
this
kind.
moreover,
we
do
not
suggest
that
size
disparity
is
relevant
to
the
decision
of
every
merger
case.
quite
possibly
there
are
industries
in
which
size
disparity
has
little
or
no
competitive
significance.”
and
the
commission
then
went
on
to
show
why
in
this
case
size
disparity
had
great
competitive
significance
because
of
the
identical
nature
of
a
product
sales
depending
on
product
differentiation
through
mass
advertising
and
the
large
multi
product
firm,
the
commission
found
quite
apart
from
advertising
discounts
had
great
competitive
advantages.
it
could
buy
network
programs
and
advertise
several
related
products
and
it
could
in
contrast
to
smaller
firms
afford
to
advertise
on
national
network
shows
and
thus
advertise
during
programs
when
advertising
is
most
effective.
it
also
would
have
greater
regional
advertising
flexibility
and
selectivity.
it
could
engage
in
joint
sales
promotion
largely
unavailable
to
smaller
single
product
firms.
in
short,
such
a
large
firm
would
raise
various
entry
by
effective
product
differentiation
and
this
would
go
for
all
of
the
smaller
firm.
moreover,
the
commission
reasoned,
the
substitution
of
procter
for
clorox
makes
entry
and
possible
de-concentration
of
the
industry
fall
as
likely.
instead
of
taking
on
the
dominant
clorox
and
enter
--
a
perspective
entrant
would
have
to
challenge
a
dominant
procter-clorox
with
all
of
its
market
power
and
advantages.
the
commission
saw
what
we
call
the
“erie
incident”
as
a
precursor
of
that
power.
in
october
1957,
shortly
after
the
procter
and
clorox
merger,
the
purex
company
selected
erie,
pennsylvania,
an
area
in
which
it
had
not
previously
sold
its
bleach
to
test
a
new
bottle,
an
allegedly
improved
bleach.
at
that
time,
clorox
had
52%
of
the
erie
market.
through
an
extensive
advertising
campaign,
purex
in
five
months
captured
32
--
3%
of
the
market.
clorox's
share
dropping
to
35%.
procter
and
clorox
responded
vigorously
with
reduced
prices
and
advertising
and
promotional
activities
which
increased
its
market
share
beyond
its
previous
condition
--
position
and
reduced
the
share
of
purex
to
7%.
purex's
president
and
other
bleach
manufactures
testified
to
their
concern
over
the
powerful
promotional
and
advertising
programs
that
procter
was
capable
of
conducting.
in
all
events,
the
commission
in
this
case
in
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
marketing
structure
found
that
the
effect
of
the
merger
would
be
to
weaken
substantially
potential
competition
in
the
industry.
of
course,
for
antitrust
laws
to
be
efficacious,
it
must
apply
to
mergers
in
their
incipiency.
you
can't
wait
until
the
merger
has
existed
for
10
or
more
years
in
order
to
move
in.
that
is
that
there
must
be
evidence
of
market
structure
and
nobody
has
disagreement
as
to
the
structure
or
to
the
field
or
the
area
involved.
and
once
you
consider
the
market
structure
and
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
therefrom,
they
must
be
decisive
as
opposed
to
evidence
of
market
behavior
after
the
acquisition.
on
the
normal
horizontal
mergers,
the
normal
vertical
merger
very
often
there
is
clearer
evidence
of
what
will
happen.
in
the
conglomerate
merger
very
often,
you
cannot
get
positive
proof
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
least
of
cases.
the
commission
is
charged
with
analyzing
and
drawing
these
inferences.
the
commission
is
charged
with
applying
it's
--
the
law
to
the
evidence
they
have
before
it.
the
commission
is
charged
with
drawing
the
necessary
inferences.
the
commission
is
charged
with
making
the
necessary
conclusions.
it
did
so
here
in
a
thoroughly
well-reasoned
opinion.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
indeed
perhaps
the
respondents
also
misconceived
the
thrust
of
the
commission's
analysis
and
indeed
the
court
certainly
did
it
in
setting
aside
the
order.
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
was
unduly
diverted
from
its
proper
tax.
it
noted
for
example
and
put
great
weight
on
the
statement
and
it
was
difficult
to
harmonize
the
two
decisions
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
a
harmonization
which
it
is
not
changed
--
charged
and
a
notation
which
fails
to
realize
that
there's
only
one
final
decision
and
that's
the
last
decision
of
the
commission
especially
with
regard
to
the
post-acquisition
evidence
because
in
between
the
two
opinions
of
the
two
commissions,
the
philadelphia
bank
and
brown
shoe
case
had
certainly
changed
the
law
as
to
post-acquisition
evidence.
and
in
this
case
the
commission
carefully
pointed
out
that
while
they
considered
the
post-acquisition
evidence,
it
had
little
value
to
their
original
determination.
however,
even
if
the
two
opinions
of
the
commission
were
--
are
irreconcilable,
commissioner
elman's
opinion
adequately
states
the
reason
for
the
change
and
he
points
it
out
in
the
beginning
of
his
opinion.
moreover,
on
such
a
novel
question,
the
commission
should
be
free
to
reassess
freshly
the
evidence.
its
decision
is
sound
and
despite
what
procter
&
gamble
says,
it's
sound
in
lore
as
well
as
it's
sound
in
economics.
now,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
should
be
affirmed
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
save
--
i'll
only
need
about
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
questions.
mr.
marshall
mr.
chief
judge,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
public
cooperation
and
not
clorox
in
the
exhibits
at
page
111x,
it
appears
that
clorox
is
listed
on
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange,
that's
on
page
111
of
the
record.
mr.
pride
emphasized
that
we
were
soft-pedaling
this
tv
package
deal.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
we
filed
a
reply
brief
on
it
which
is
the
opposite
of
self-pedaling
it.
the
reply
brief
also
directs
to
attention
of
the
court
to
the
argument
about
the
opposition
on
the
penn-olin
case
in
which
we
point
out
it
is
not
whether
procter
in
fact
would
have
entered
the
bleach
industry
on
its
own
but
for
the
merger.
it
is
whether
procter's
ability
and
willingness
to
enter
if
clorox
made
any
attractive
offer
is
the
point
involved.
the
one
other
point
that
i'd
like
to
mention
is
that
the
--
repeatedly
the
statement
is
made
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
in
this
instance
is
not
required
to
read
the
entire
record
because
commissioner
elman
in
his
opinion
has
so
carefully
gone
over
it
that's
why
we
see
no
need
to
go
over
it
here.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
that
court,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
set
aside
the
federal
trade
commission's
order
that
procter
&
gamble
divest
itself
of
assets
from
the
clorox
chemical
company,
the
nation's
largest
bleach
manufacturer,
which
it
had
acquired
through
a
merger.
at
the
time
of
the
merger
in
1959
procter
&
gamble
was
among
the
nation's
50
largest
manufacturing
corporations.
it's
sales
in
1957
were
an
excess
of
$1
billion.
procter
&
gamble
is
a
large
diversified
manufacturer
of
low
price
rapid
turnover
household
products
sold
primarily
through
grocery,
drug,
and
department
stores.
its
annual
sales
of
soaps
and
detergents
in
kansas
alone,
products
very
similar
to
bleach
were
more
than
$500
million
in
1957,
for
example.
procter's
principal
products
are
marketing
to
housewives
largely
by
what
is
called
“pre-selling.”
by
pre-selling
it's
understood
to
mean
that
through
advertising
and
other
sales
promotions.data
in
1957,
procter
was
the
largest
advertiser
in
the
country,
spending
more
than
$80
million
on
advertising
and
an
additional
$47
million
in
promotions.
expenditures
on
advertising
substantially
greater
than
the
total
sales
of
the
two
leading
bleach
producers,
clorox
and
purex.
between
1946
and
1962,
product's
net
sales
increased
by
more
than
400%
which
shows
recent
rapid
growth
in
its
product
sales,
and
this
also
showed
a
rapid
diversification
into
new
product
lines
closely
related
to
its
existing
lines.
procter's
president
justified
that
approximately
70%
of
procter's
household
product
volume
came
from
products
not
even
in
existence
in
1946.
the
more
narrow
period
between
1952
and
1957,
procter's
sales
rose
some
40%.
a
substantial
part
of
that
growth
was
due
to
the
introduction
of
new
brands
and
product
lines
in
which
product
--
procter
has
not
previously
been
selling.
now,
as
to
the
clorox
company,
in
1957,
the
clorox
chemical
company
was
engaged
almost
exclusively
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
household
liquid
bleach.
with
13
plants
located
throughout
the
country,
clorox
was
the
only
truly
nationwide
manufacturer
and
seller
of
liquid
bleach.
it
accounted
for
48.8%
of
the
nation's
total
annual
sales
of
household
liquid
bleach,
and
in
some
regional
markets,
clorox's
sale
was
even
higher.
for
example,
the
mid-atlantic
states
where
clorox
had
72%
of
all
the
sales
of
liquid
bleach.
now,
what
is
liquid
bleach?
household
liquid
bleach
is
used
principally
as
a
whitener
in
the
cleansing
of
clothes,
cleaning
of
clothes
and
also
it's
used
as
a
germicide
and
disinfectant
at
times.
all
major
brands
of
liquid
bleach
are
chemically
identical,
a
solution
of
five-and-one-quarter
percent
sodium
high
chloride
in
water.
bleach
is
easily
manufactured
and
its
manufacture
involves
no
patents
and
no
trade
secrets,
and
it's
a
concentrated
industry.
the
bleach
industry,
despite
the
lack
of
technological
barriers
to
entry
remains
highly
concentrated.
two
firms,
clorox
with
48.8%
of
national
sales
and
the
purex
company
with
15.7%
accounted
in
1959
for
about
65%
of
the
total
sales
of
household
liquid
bleach.
six
firms
indeed
accounted
for
80%
of
all
of
the
sales.
the
remaining
20%
is
scattered
among
some
200
other
producers,
most
of
which
are
quite
small.
concentration
is
even
greater
on
a
local
or
regional
basis.
this
is
due
in
part
to
the
high
cost
of
transportation
of
bleach
in
relation
to
its
unit
price.
freight
averages
about
10%
of
the
cost.
thus,
it
is
generally
not
economical
for
a
manufacturer
to
sell
beyond
300
miles
of
its
plant.
so
as
i've
said,
only
clorox
has
enough
plants
at
various
locations
to
sell
throughout
the
country
and
to
be
nationwide
in
production.
even
purex,
the
second
ranking
seller,
distributes
its
bleach
in
only
one
half
of
the
nation.
the
result
is
that
the
shares
of
the
leading
producers
are
larger
in
particular
areas
than
the
national
figures
would
indicate.
for
example,
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
clorox
and
two
other
firms
had
97.8%
of
all
the
bleach
sales
in
metropolitan
chicago.
clorox
and
one
other
had
88%
of
the
southwest
region,
clorox
and
another
had
81%
of
the
pacific
market,
and
clorox
alone
has
70%
of
all
the
sales
in
the
mid-atlantic
states.
bleach
is
like
other
low
priced
rapid
turnover
household
items
heavily
pre-sold
by
the
manufacture
through
advertising.
for
example,
in
its
last
full
year
of
independent
operation,
clorox
spent
an
amount
equivalent
to
approximately
10%
of
its
annual
sales
for
advertising,
and
numerous
witnesses
testified
to
the
critical
importance
of
advertising
and
promotional
efforts
by
the
manufacturer
in
order
to
create
sufficient
demand
for
his
brand
and
to
entitle
it
to
sufficient
shelf
space
which
is
allocated
by
the
retailers
according
to
the
consumers'
demand.
thus,
this
case
involves
the
acquisition
of
the
nation's
dominant
liquid
bleach
producer
by
the
nation's
leading
manufacturer
of
other
household
products
closely
related
to
bleach
such
as
detergents,
soaps
and
cleansers
or
more
broadly
the
nation's
leading
manufacturers,
of
procter
&
gamble's
own
annual
report
in
56
and
57
states
quote.
“low
priced,
rapid
turnover,
household
items
sold
primarily
to
grocery,
drug
and
department
stores.”
because
of
the
functionally
related
product
lines
and
merger,
though
conglomerate
rather
than
horizontal
or
vertical,
was
aptly
described
by
the
commission
as
one
involving
product
extension
by
the
acquiring
firm
of
procter.
at
this
point,
i
would
not
like
to
recite
all
of
the
reasons
given
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission
which
led
the
commission
to
conclude
to
the
effect
of
the
merger
and
the
words
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
relevant
market
nor
shall
i
recite
in
detail
the
reasons
given
by
the
sixth
circuit
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
for
its
setting
aside
of
the
commission
order.
indeed,
in
this
case
procter
&
gamble
points
out
in
its
brief
the
full
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
to
be
as
follows,
the
procter
&
gamble
in
its
brief
says,
“the
division
of
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
predicated
upon
a
comprehensive
consideration
of
the
whole
record
in
this
case
turns
upon
one
ultimate
finding.”
the
court
said,
“considering
the
record
as
a
whole,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
decision
of
the
second
commission
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
it
is
partly
all
that
the
court
said.
mr.
marshall
not
exactly
the
other
way.
the
commission
in
its
original
decision
said
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
establish
that
this
will
be
the
substantial
tendency;
and
sent
it
back
for
a
hearing
as
to
what
had
happened
since
the
merger.
the
hearing
was
held.
the
commissioner
--
the
hearing
examiner
again
said
practically
the
same
thing
and
the
commission
in
its
second
opinion
held
that
it
was
not
bound
at
all
by
the
first
opinion.
it
was
not
the
law
of
the
case
and
indeed
the
law
had
changed
in
the
interim
by
the
brown
shoe
case
and
the
national
bank
case.
mr.
marshall
all
but
one.
but
i
submit,
sir,
that
under
recognized
administrative
law
it's
still
the
same
commission.
suffice
it
to
say
at
this
point
that
in
our
view
the
court
of
appeals
while
extensively
finding
the
order
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
in
fact,
actually,
disagreed
which
the
commission's
conclusion.
one,
by
substituting
its
own
conclusion
that
the
bleach
industry
was
competitive
for
the
commission's
finding
to
the
contrary,
and
two,
by
its
failure
to
properly
evaluate
the
economic
and
antitrust
implications
of
potential
competition
and
barriers
to
inquiry
of
new
firms
in
the
oligopolistic
industries.
now,
first
of
all
under
section
7
as
commissioner
elman
said
and
nobody
will
dispute
there
is
process
standard
as
to
where
you're
under
section
7
or
not.
but
there
are
certain
matters
that
are
recognized.
for
example,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
a
highly
concentrated
market
where
a
few
of
the
sellers
account
for
most
of
the
sales,
a
significant,
perhaps
insignificant
form
of
competitive
restraint
is
that
of
potential
competition.
the
treat
to
other
firms
outside
the
market
might
enter
if
the
conditions
within
the
market
such
as
the
setting
of
high
price
level
make
entry
attractive.
a
merger
then
which
eliminates
potential
competition
by
removing
a
likely
entrant
to
the
market
or
which
weakens
potential
competition
by
increasing
the
barriers
to
entry
into
the
market
may
each
thereby
violate
section
7.
with
these
general
propositions
i
don't
believe
there
can
be
much
dispute.
but
the
respondents
assert
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
the
commission
had
no
factually
adequate
basis
and,
hence,
no
legally
justifiable
reasons
for
concluding
that
procter's
acquisition
of
clorox
might
probably
impair
the
efficiency
of
potential
competition.
we
think
the
commission's
order
should
have
been
sustained.
and
as
for
these
reasons,
first,
the
commission
examined
in
detail
the
structure
of
the
household
liquid
bleach
market
and
it
found
that
two
items,
the
two
firms
accounted
for
65%
of
the
nation's
total
sales
and
it
found
that
in
some
section
of
the
country
the
share
of
one
firm,
usually
clorox,
approached
monopoly
proportions
and
that
in
other
sections
clorox
and
one
or
two
others
accounted
for
80%
of
the
sales
of
bleach.
the
commission
found
that
the
dominant
firm,
clorox,
was
a
recognized
price
leader
and
that
other
firms
almost
uniformly
followed
clorox's
lead
in
setting
prices.
thus,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
industry
was
highly
concentrated
and
oligopolistic.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
thought
that
the
evidence
did
not
establish
that
there
was
anything
unhealthy
about
the
market's
conditions.
and
in
making
this
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
unhealthy,
they
relied
on
o
nly
two
facts.
one
was
the
existence
of
a
fringe
of
some
200
producers
accounting
for
20%
of
the
nation
sales.
yet,
the
commission
had
specifically
noted
that
only
eight
fringe
manufacturers
had
assets
of
over
million
dollars
and
very
few
had
assets
of
more
than
$75,000.
plainly,
the
commission
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
existence
of
the
small
firms
gave
no
assurance
of
competition
within
the
industry,
especially
in
light
of
the
emphasis
in
the
industry
on
product
differentiation
through
mass
advertising.
the
second
part
relied
under
the
court
of
appeals,
was
its
conclusion
that
the
industry
was
healthy
and
that
point
was
that
after
merger,
after
the
merger,
producers
other
than
clorox
where
quote,
“were
selling
more
bleach
for
more
money
than
ever
before."
end
of
quote.
but
the
record
shows
that
clorox
in
the
same
period
increased
its
market
share
from
48.7%
to
52%.
in
short,
the
court
below
patently
erred
in
rejecting
the
commission's
conclusions
concerning
the
industry.
that
error
underlies
the
courts
failed
to
recognize
the
importance
of
the
potential
competition,
the
point
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
respondent
asserts
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
the
commission's
conclusion
with
respect
to
procter's
likely
entrant
and
with
respect
to
the
probe
competitive
effective
of
a
threat
of
entry
posed
by
this,
both
of
which
relate
to
potential
competition
are
unsupported
in
the
record.let
us
turn
to
the
evidence
on
potential
competition
and
the
inferences
drawn
there
from
--
by
the
commission.
procter's
history
of
expansion
and
diversification
through
product
extension,
the
functionally
closely
related
product
lines
and
the
true
intra-corporate
memoranda
of
the
procter
company
relating
to
the
bleach
industry
and
the
clorox
company.
now,
there
are
two
memoranda
in
the
record
in
which
in
the
first,
procter
said,
“procter's
experts
suggested
that
while
it
might
be
good
to
go
in
to
the
liquid
bleach
industry
it
would
not
be
profitable.
and
the
second
one,
urged
that
they
buy
clorox
providing
they
could
buy
it
for
$30
million
or
less.”
i
have
only
averted
to
the
evidence
on
the
first
two
points,
but
to
recapitulate
procter
had
a
history
of
expansion
and
diversification
in
the
industries
where
it
had
not
previously
sold.
some
of
the
expansion
was
internal
and
some
by
acquisition,
but
all
of
it
involved
the
same
items,
low
price,
rapid
turnover,
household
items,
functionally
related
to
similar
production,
distribution
or
marketing
techniques,
including
heavy
emphasis
on
product
differentiation
and
the
pre-selling
through
mass
advertising.
and
in
addition
procter
is
a
recognized
leader
in
the
field
of
soaps,
detergents
and
cleansers.
products
whose
function
in
relation
to
bleach
is
even
more
pronounced
because
of
similar
and
complimentary
uses.
procter
has
been
expanding
in
these
very
areas
steadily
and
its
strength
and
success
in
product
extension
is
demonstrated
as
the
commission
found
by
the
comet
abrasive
cleansing
campaign.
procter
introduced
comet
in
1957
at
a
time
when
colgate-palmolive's
brand
ajax
accounted
for
roughly
56%
of
the
sales
of
abrasive
cleansers.
in
the
course
of
22
months,
procter
spent
$7.2
million
on
advertising
and
promotional
activities
for
comet,
and
then
--
thereby
achieved
its
36.5%
of
the
market.
despite
this
evidence
of
procter's
expansion
by
product
extension
into
functionally
closely
related
product
lines,
the
court
of
appeals
discarded
this
conclusion
and
substituted
its
own
conclusions
as
follows,
quote,
“household
liquid
bleach
is
an
old
product.
procter
is
an
old
company.
if
procter
wants
to
bring
it,
it
is
a
prime
that
it
never
lost
its
balance
and
fell
in
during
the
many
years
in
which
such
bleach
was
on
the
market.”
while
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
procter's
expansion
into
industries
in
which
it
had
not
previously
sold,
the
commission
again
weighed
procter's
study
of
the
bleach
market
and
of
the
clorox
company
has
demonstrated
in
these
two
memoranda,
55
and
57,
and
we
discussed
that
evidence
in
our
brief
at
pages
17
and
19.
respondent,
however,
is
quite
correct
in
stating
that
the
recommendation
of
procter's
officials
was
at
that
time
against
independent
entry
through
internal
expansion.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
memorandum
shows
that
procter
considered
the
bleach
industry
and
had
recognized
that
no
one
should
doubt
that
the
market
was
complimentary
to
those
of
the
other
procter
products.
there
were
some
--
seldom
be
anymore
direct
evidence
that
a
firm
is
a
likely
entering
into
a
new
field.or
that
it
exercise
a
pro
competitive
influence
by
its
presence
on
the
fringe
of
the
market
beyond
what
we
have
here.
yet,
the
picture
is
not
quite
complete.
there
is
also
some
evidence
summarized
in
note
38
in
page
46
of
our
brief
that
for
example
a
small
firm
discontinued
to
manufacture
bleach
because
of
the
acquisition
of
clorox
by
procter.
all
of
this
evidence,
especially
in
light
of
the
commission's
detailed
analysis
of
the
market
structure,
we
think
it
clearly
shows
that
procter
presented
potential
competition
in
the
bleach
industry.
now,
to
another
aspect
of
the
merger,
the
merger
substituted
for
clorox
which
had
assets
of
$12
million
and
sales
of
$40
million,
the
procter
company
which
in
1957
had
sales
in
excess
of
a
billion
and
profits
of
more
than
$47
million.
more
strikingly,
however,
is
the
comparison
of
the
combined
procter
and
clorox
with
the
remaining
competitors
in
the
bleach
industry.
the
others
had
remaining
--
the
others
and
remaining
major
bleach
firm,
purex,
which
is
more
diversified
then
was
clorox
had
sales
in
a
year
prior
to
the
merger
totalling
5%
of
procter.
in
short,
procter
separately
grows
the
remaining
firms
in
the
industry
for
a
dominant
single
product
manufacture
of
bleach.
the
merger
substitutes
giant
multi
product
firm
dominant
in
several
product
lines
yet
respondent
procter
&
gamble
has
asserted
and
the
courts
of
appeals
recited
that
the
--
that
the
commission's
decision
condemn
big
business
per
se,
and
based
its
decision
on
procter's
size.
that
factual
argument
does
not
do
justice
to
the
commission's
careful
and
able
opinion
where
the
commission
over
and
over
again
made
its
position
quite
explicit.
for
example,
the
commission
said
it
should
be
very
clear
that
in
deeming
procter
size
a
pertinent
consideration
in
the
decision
of
this
case,
we
are
most
emphatically
not
adapting
any
view
that
big
business
per
se
is
anticompetitive
or
undesirable
and
should
be
attacked
under
section
7
or
any
other
antitrust
statute.
procter's
size
is
significant
in
this
case
only
insofar
as
it
is
huge
--
as
it
is
hugely
disparate
compared
with
the
size
of
the
firms
in
the
relevant
market.
“disparity
of
size
not
absolute
size
has
importance
in
a
merger
of
this
kind.
moreover,
we
do
not
suggest
that
size
disparity
is
relevant
to
the
decision
of
every
merger
case.
quite
possibly
there
are
industries
in
which
size
disparity
has
little
or
no
competitive
significance.”
and
the
commission
then
went
on
to
show
why
in
this
case
size
disparity
had
great
competitive
significance
because
of
the
identical
nature
of
a
product
sales
depending
on
product
differentiation
through
mass
advertising
and
the
large
multi
product
firm,
the
commission
found
quite
apart
from
advertising
discounts
had
great
competitive
advantages.
it
could
buy
network
programs
and
advertise
several
related
products
and
it
could
in
contrast
to
smaller
firms
afford
to
advertise
on
national
network
shows
and
thus
advertise
during
programs
when
advertising
is
most
effective.
it
also
would
have
greater
regional
advertising
flexibility
and
selectivity.
it
could
engage
in
joint
sales
promotion
largely
unavailable
to
smaller
single
product
firms.
in
short,
such
a
large
firm
would
raise
various
entry
by
effective
product
differentiation
and
this
would
go
for
all
of
the
smaller
firm.
moreover,
the
commission
reasoned,
the
substitution
of
procter
for
clorox
makes
entry
and
possible
de-concentration
of
the
industry
fall
as
likely.
instead
of
taking
on
the
dominant
clorox
and
enter
--
a
perspective
entrant
would
have
to
challenge
a
dominant
procter-clorox
with
all
of
its
market
power
and
advantages.
the
commission
saw
what
we
call
the
“erie
incident”
as
a
precursor
of
that
power.
in
october
1957,
shortly
after
the
procter
and
clorox
merger,
the
purex
company
selected
erie,
pennsylvania,
an
area
in
which
it
had
not
previously
sold
its
bleach
to
test
a
new
bottle,
an
allegedly
improved
bleach.
at
that
time,
clorox
had
52%
of
the
erie
market.
through
an
extensive
advertising
campaign,
purex
in
five
months
captured
32
--
3%
of
the
market.
clorox's
share
dropping
to
35%.
procter
and
clorox
responded
vigorously
with
reduced
prices
and
advertising
and
promotional
activities
which
increased
its
market
share
beyond
its
previous
condition
--
position
and
reduced
the
share
of
purex
to
7%.
purex's
president
and
other
bleach
manufactures
testified
to
their
concern
over
the
powerful
promotional
and
advertising
programs
that
procter
was
capable
of
conducting.
in
all
events,
the
commission
in
this
case
in
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
marketing
structure
found
that
the
effect
of
the
merger
would
be
to
weaken
substantially
potential
competition
in
the
industry.
of
course,
for
antitrust
laws
to
be
efficacious,
it
must
apply
to
mergers
in
their
incipiency.
you
can't
wait
until
the
merger
has
existed
for
10
or
more
years
in
order
to
move
in.
that
is
that
there
must
be
evidence
of
market
structure
and
nobody
has
disagreement
as
to
the
structure
or
to
the
field
or
the
area
involved.
and
once
you
consider
the
market
structure
and
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
therefrom,
they
must
be
decisive
as
opposed
to
evidence
of
market
behavior
after
the
acquisition.
on
the
normal
horizontal
mergers,
the
normal
vertical
merger
very
often
there
is
clearer
evidence
of
what
will
happen.
in
the
conglomerate
merger
very
often,
you
cannot
get
positive
proof
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
least
of
cases.
the
commission
is
charged
with
analyzing
and
drawing
these
inferences.
the
commission
is
charged
with
applying
it's
--
the
law
to
the
evidence
they
have
before
it.
the
commission
is
charged
with
drawing
the
necessary
inferences.
the
commission
is
charged
with
making
the
necessary
conclusions.
it
did
so
here
in
a
thoroughly
well-reasoned
opinion.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
indeed
perhaps
the
respondents
also
misconceived
the
thrust
of
the
commission's
analysis
and
indeed
the
court
certainly
did
it
in
setting
aside
the
order.
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
was
unduly
diverted
from
its
proper
tax.
it
noted
for
example
and
put
great
weight
on
the
statement
and
it
was
difficult
to
harmonize
the
two
decisions
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
a
harmonization
which
it
is
not
changed
--
charged
and
a
notation
which
fails
to
realize
that
there's
only
one
final
decision
and
that's
the
last
decision
of
the
commission
especially
with
regard
to
the
post-acquisition
evidence
because
in
between
the
two
opinions
of
the
two
commissions,
the
philadelphia
bank
and
brown
shoe
case
had
certainly
changed
the
law
as
to
post-acquisition
evidence.
and
in
this
case
the
commission
carefully
pointed
out
that
while
they
considered
the
post-acquisition
evidence,
it
had
little
value
to
their
original
determination.
however,
even
if
the
two
opinions
of
the
commission
were
--
are
irreconcilable,
commissioner
elman's
opinion
adequately
states
the
reason
for
the
change
and
he
points
it
out
in
the
beginning
of
his
opinion.
moreover,
on
such
a
novel
question,
the
commission
should
be
free
to
reassess
freshly
the
evidence.
its
decision
is
sound
and
despite
what
procter
&
gamble
says,
it's
sound
in
lore
as
well
as
it's
sound
in
economics.
now,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
should
be
affirmed
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
save
--
i'll
only
need
about
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
questions.
mr.
marshall
mr.
chief
judge,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
public
cooperation
and
not
clorox
in
the
exhibits
at
page
111x,
it
appears
that
clorox
is
listed
on
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange,
that's
on
page
111
of
the
record.
mr.
pride
emphasized
that
we
were
soft-pedaling
this
tv
package
deal.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
we
filed
a
reply
brief
on
it
which
is
the
opposite
of
self-pedaling
it.
the
reply
brief
also
directs
to
attention
of
the
court
to
the
argument
about
the
opposition
on
the
penn-olin
case
in
which
we
point
out
it
is
not
whether
procter
in
fact
would
have
entered
the
bleach
industry
on
its
own
but
for
the
merger.
it
is
whether
procter's
ability
and
willingness
to
enter
if
clorox
made
any
attractive
offer
is
the
point
involved.
the
one
other
point
that
i'd
like
to
mention
is
that
the
--
repeatedly
the
statement
is
made
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
in
this
instance
is
not
required
to
read
the
entire
record
because
commissioner
elman
in
his
opinion
has
so
carefully
gone
over
it
that's
why
we
see
no
need
to
go
over
it
here.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
be
reversed.
thank
you.
