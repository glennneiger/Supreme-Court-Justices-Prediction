mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
time
remaining
to
respond,
i
will
discuss
the
first
point
that
it
was
brought
up
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
that
was
whether
the
admission
of
the
statements
of
the
co-defendant
king,
with
limiting
instructions
which
statements
implicated
the
defendant
gilbert,
violated
his
right
and
denied
him
a
fair
trial.
it
is
our
position
of
course
that
under
the
limiting
instructions
that
there
was
no
denial
of
a
fair
trial
and
that
the
jury
could
follow
these
instructions
and
it
was
not
that
type
of
a
case
that
they
were
unable
to
--
mr.
william
e.
james
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
there
was
no
issue
raised
in
the
federal
case.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
king
wasn't
involved
in
those
robberies.
they
were
separate
robberies.
king
was
only
involved
in
the
robbery
involving
mutual
savings
of
alhambra,
and
so
it
--
wasn't
involved
in
that
case.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
does
not
bring
--
present
an
occasion
where
this
court
might
want
to
reexamine
the
holding
that
it
made
in
delli
paoli.
we
think
that
the
circumstances
here
quite
clearly
point
out
that
the
jury
in
this
case
was
able
to
follow
the
limiting
instructions
and
we
want
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
these
limiting
instructions
were
very
precise.
they
were
given,
not
at
only
at
the
end
of
the
case,
but
the
admonitions
were
given
to
the
jury
at
the
very
time
the
statements
were
being
introduced.
i
think
the
five
factors,
which
this
court
found
very
important,
delli
paoli
apply
here,
and
that
this
is
even
a
stronger
case
than
delli
paoli.
there
are
certain
considerations
that
we
should
note
here.
in
this
case,
the
two
defendants
were
represented
by
separate
attorneys.
in
fact
that
there
was
a
separability
as
to
them
was
made
evident
to
them
through
out
the
case.
the
defendants
were
represented
as
they
say
by
separate
counsel
and
there
was
no
motion
needed,
pretrial
or
during
the
trial
for
a
separate
trial
and
we
think
this
is
significant
as
the
case
developed.
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
the
co-defendant
king
took
the
stand
and
on
examination
on
the
stand
acknowledged
that
his
statements
were
motivated
by
desire,
to
place
the
(inaudible)
gilbert,
and
to
point
the
finger
of
guilt
at
him.
and
the
district
attorney
didn't
rely
on
this
statement
as
to
gilbert,
in
fact
he
was
discounting
the
statements
of
king
and
discounting
particularly
that
part
of
it
which
would
indicate
that
there
was
compulsion
on
the
part
of
king
because
of
gilbert's
actions
and
the
like.
but
we
think
that
these
are
all
significant
factors
which
would
show
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
introduction
into
this
joint
trial
of
the
statements
of
a
co-defendant
with
these
very
clear
and
explicit
limiting
instructions.
now,
mr.
sokolow
has
briefly
touched
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
the
statement
of
king
to
the
authorities
was
that
he
and
the
co-defendant,
weaver,
the
co-robber
i
should
say,
weaver
who
was
killed
in
this
robbery
had
met
at
a
parole
meeting
and
thereafter,
they
had
discussed
the
stealing
of
the
car
by
king
for
certain
purposes.
and
it
was
agreed
on
the
morning
of
january
the
3rd
1964
that
king
would
steal
a
car.
he
stole
one.
he
met
weaver
and
gilbert.
drove
with
them
up
through
alhambra
and
awaited
for
them
out
there.
his
statement
to
the
officer
was
they
returned
--
weaver
was
bleeding
profusely
and
king
--
gilbert,
according
to
king's
statement,
put
a
gun
up
to
his
stomach
and
told
me,
he'd
better
do
what
he
told
him
to
do,
and
that
he
had
just
killed
a
cop
and
he'd
probably
kill
more
that
day.
and
king
went
with
gilbert
to
gilbert's
apartment
where
apparently
gilbert
made
another
attempt
on
his
life
according
to
king's
statements.
but
thereafter,
king
admitted
that
gilbert
gave
him
$1300
and
king
drove
gilbert
to
a
place
where
he
met
someone
and
king
left.
now
this
was
a
purport
of
king's
statements.
now,
king
took
the
stand
and
testified
insofar
as
it
was
immaterial
to
the
charges,
the
same
as
his
statement.
he
omitted
in
his
testimony
the
reference
to
the
statements
supposedly
made
by
gilbert
that
he
just
shot
a
cop
and
that
he
would
kill
more.
now,
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
when
the
statement
was
introduced
with
limiting
instructions
and
i
think
it
is
significant
at
this
time
to
note
that
at
the
penalty
phase
of
a
trial,
these
statements
were
not
reintroduced
and
that
there
was
no
testimony
by
king
at
the
penalty
phase
and
the
district
attorney
made
no
comment
on
the
statements
of
the
defendant
king.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
under
one
--
penal
code
section
190.1,
in
the
ordinary
case,
unless
there
is
some
unusual
circumstance,
the
jury
that
adheres
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
will
also
determine
a
penalty.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
at
the
penalty
trial,
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
has
been
determined,
the
jury
can
hear
--
the
testimony
concerning
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
the
background
and
history
of
the
defendant
and
any
evidence
in
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
a
penalty.
we
submit
that
at
that
time,
the
people's
testimony
related
to
the
background
and
history
of
this
defendant
gilbert
just
starting
out
with
a
murder
he
committed
when
he
was
serving
time
in
a
state
prison
in
1947,
a
burglary
that
he
committed
in
1960,
when
he
was
--
after
he
was
paroled.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
gilbert.
the
escape
in
1963
and
then
the
series
of
robberies
that
he
started
in
october
of
1963
culminating
in
these
acts
of
violence
that
occurred
on
january
3rd
of
1964.
and
this
is
what
the
jury
heard
in
determining
the
penalty
and
we
don't
understand
this
case
as
being
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
penal
code
section
190.1.
and
we
submit
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
penalty
trial
where
a
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
gilbert
having
already
been
determined
and
that
--
at
the
guilt
trial,
there
was
obviously
no
prejudice
because
there
were
limiting
instructions
and
i
think
there
were
five
factors
in
delli
paoli
which
this
court
dealt
with
very
significant
which
we
feel
exist
in
this
case.
my
first
note
as
i'd
already
indicated
that
the
judge
in
this
case
wasn't
content
with
just
merely
giving
an
instruction
at
the
end
of
the
case,
telling
the
jury
that
the
statements
of
a
co-defendant
made
in
--
not
in
the
presence
of
the
other
defendant
wasn't
binding
on
it.
at
the
very
time
the
statement
was
made
and
this
was
at
the
close
of
the
people's
case
in
chief,
the
counsel
then
representing
gilbert,
when
a
question
was
asked
of
officer
bennett
concerning
king's
statements,
said
i
will
object
to
the
question
your
honor
as
to
the
defendant
gilbert
on
the
ground
that
it
is
hearsay
as
to
him.
and
the
district
attorney
then
said,
the
objection
is
well
taken.
and
the
court
said,
obviously,
it
wouldn't
apply
to
the
defendant
gilbert
and
whatever
is
said
here,
you
are
to
draw
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
defendant
gilbert
and
disregarded
insofar
as
the
defendant
gilbert
is
concerned.
now,
thereafter,
counsel
representing
gilbert
made
a
motion
that
the
references
to
gilbert
be
deleted
in
this
statement
and
the
court
heard
this
and
determined
that
it
wouldn't
be
feasible
to
delete
these
references
by
name
to
gilbert
and
of
--
obviously
of
course
at
that
time,
at
the
end
of
the
people's
case,
with
all
this
eyewitness
identification,
the
identity
of
the
particular
person
namely
gilbert
was
clear
and
the
court
felt
that
it
would
not
be
fair
for
the
declarant
to
delete
it.
however,
it
continued.
i
think
however
at
this
time
in
view
of
the
testimony
of
this
witness,
which
she
has
not
completed
as
yet
that
i
should
inform
you
that
this
testimony
is
not
binding
on
the
defendant
gilbert
in
anyway.
it
is
completely
hearsay
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
you
are
not
to
draw
any
inferences
whatever
from
the
testimony
you've
heard
from
this
witness
as
to
anything
in
connection
with
the
defendant
gilbert.
i
will
warn
you
again
about
this,
but
i
thought
it
would
only
be
fair
that
i
give
you
this
admonition.
and
the
court
continued
to
warn
constantly
during
the
introduction
of
the
statements
and
it
concluded
with
the
instruction
given
both
at
the
guilt
phase
and
at
the
penalty
phase,
that
they
were
not
to
consider
the
statements
of
the
co-defendant
made
outside
of
the
presence.
now,
we
submit
that
this
was
a
very
significant
factor.
we
would
urge
that
in
delli
paoli,
this
court
found
that
the
fact
that
--
in
that
case
the
conspiracy
was
a
simple
one
was
--
and
therefore
the
instruction
would
be
easy
for
the
jury
to
understand
was
an
important
factor.
we
submit
that
the
case,
the
issues
here
was
simple
and
that
the
severability
as
to
the
two
defendants
was
significant.
gilbert
was
the
one
who
entered
the
savings
and
loan,
shot
the
police
officer.
king's
position
was
merely
the
driver
of
the
get-away
car.
we
also
note
that
there
were
separate
attorneys
and
we've
also
mentioned
there
was
no
request
at
anytime
for
a
separate
trial
as
to
these
two
defendants.
now,
the
introduction
of
the
statement
of
king
was
postponed
to
the
end
of
the
government's
case
and
this
court
felt
that
that
was
significant
in
delli
paoli
because
it
made
the
instructions
in
the
admonitions
easier
for
the
jury
to
understand
and
to
apply.
and
the
statement
of
the
co-defendant
in
delli
paoli
merely
corroborated
what
was
already
in
the
governor's
--
government's
case
and
we
submit
that
at
this
stage,
the
jury
obviously
knew
that
gilbert
was
the
man
who
perpetrated
the
robbery
for
all
the
mass
of
eyewitness
identification.
and
they
had
the
confrontation
in
gilbert
which
they
didn't
have
in
delli
paoli
as
i
recall.
and
i
think
the
fifth
factor
which
is
most
important
is
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
jury
was
unable
to
understand
the
admonition
and
the
instruction
of
the
judge.
and
we
think
this
is
significant
here,
what
is
probably
more
significant
is
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
did
not
follow
the
admonition
and
the
instruction
of
the
judge.
and
i
think
the
reference
to
jackson
versus
denno
which
counsel
made
is
inappropriate
because
their
witness,
the
court
was
dealing
with
an
involuntary
confession.
it
didn't
have
an
involuntary
confession
here,
you
had
a
confession
that
was
voluntarily
made
by
the
co-defendant.
and
we
submit
that
in
--
under
such
a
circumstance,
that
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
jackson
wasn't
applicable
and
what
this
court
said
in
the
very
recent
case
of
spencer
versus
texas,
i
think
it's
quite
appropriate
where
an
effort
was
made
to
say
that
a
jury
could
not
understand
it
clear
and
explicit
instruction
to
--
in
spencer,
limit
its
application
as
to
testimony
concerning
the
defendant's
prior
felony
convictions.
and
this
court
said,
it
would
be
extravagant
in
the
extreme
to
take
jackson
as
it
--
evidencing
a
general
distrust
on
the
part
of
this
court,
of
the
ability
of
juries
to
approach
their
test
responsibly
and
to
sort
out
issues
given
to
them
under
proper
instructions
by
the
judge
in
the
criminal
case
or
standing
for
the
proposition
that
limiting
instructions
can
never
purge
the
erroneous
introduction
of
evidence
or
limit
the
evidence
to
its
rightful
purpose.
we
submit
that
the
instructions
in
this
case
and
the
admonitions
in
this
case
certainly
could
lead
the
jury
to
limit
the
application
of
the
statements
of
the
co-defendant
king
and
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall
right
off
and
of
course,
there
were
two
defendants
and
there
were
seven
counts
of
felony
and
i
would
have
to
make
reference
to
the
clerk's
transcript
for
that
period
of
time.
i
don't
think
it
was
any
unusual
period
of
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
they
came
back
and
they
asked
for
instructions.
they
asked
for
the
reading
of
the
testimony,
i
believe,
of
one
of
the
defense
witnesses,
they
asked
for
instructions
as
it
related
to
accomplices
and
to
corroboration
as
i
recall.
they
did
not
ask
for
the
repetition
of
any
instructions
relating
to
what
they
should
do
or
how
they
should
treat
statements
of
a
co-defendant.
and
i
think
those
instructions
were
clear
and
as
this
court
pointed
in
delli
paoli
explicitly.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
reason
for
the
--
in
the
california
supreme
court
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
was
their
application
of
the
dorado
rule,
that
the
record
did
not
show
that
there
had
been
an
admonition
request
--
required
people
versus
dorado
with
which
this
court
is
familiar,
that
the
defendant
could
have
an
attorney
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
this
was
of
course
prior
to
june
13th
of
last
year
and
we
now
know
that
it
was
not
a
federally
compelled
reversal.
mr.
william
e.
james
by
the
man
whose
the
--
king's
co-defendant,
the
declarant's
co-defendant?
mr.
william
e.
james
gilbert,
well
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
state
--
mr.
william
e.
james
because
the
court
felt
that
the
jury
could
follow
the
instructions
in
the
admonition
of
the
court
and
not
apply
the
statement
made
by
the
co-defendant
with
these
limiting
instructions
to
gilbert.
and
that
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
it
had
no
prejudice.
mr.
william
e.
james
because
it
was
not
introduced
this
to
gilbert.
and
the
court
specifically
admonished
the
jury
that
it
was
not
to
be
introduced
as
to
gilbert
and
they
were
not
to
consider
it
or
draw
any
inferences
from
that
testimony
as
it
related
to
gilbert.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
and
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
gilbert
certainly
had
confrontation
which
as
i
recall
in
delli
paoli.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
delli
paoli
did
not
have
confrontation
of
the
co-defendant
whitley
who
didn't
take
the
stand.
so
one
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
big
objections
to
the
introduction
of
hearsay
was
obviated
confrontation
and
the
right
of
cross-examination
under
oath.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
think,
if
we
believe
that
juries
can
follow
simple
and
explicit
instructions,
we
would
find
that
there
was
no
error
here
because
the
jury
was
told
expressly
not
to
consider
this
testimony
as
it
related
to
gilbert.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
it
had
some
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
reversal.
it
was
not
because
king
took
the
stand
and
testified
himself.
that
had
no
relation
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
with
the
reversal
in
king
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
because
of
the
introduction
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
of
those
statements
in
confession.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
would
think
however
the
california
supreme
court,
when
applied
to
harmless
error
rule
where
the
--
its
interpretation
of
the
dorado
was
involved.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
james
oh,
incidentally,
i
understand
the
court
only
has
one
copy
of
the
record.
we
would
be
very
happy
to
lodge
with
the
court
our
copies
of
the
record
and
while
we
only
have
--
mr.
william
e.
james
maybe
so,
i'll
ask
mr.
sokolow
(voice
overlap)
about
it.
mr.
william
e.
james
we'll
do
that
by
letter?
mr.
william
e.
james
we
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
probably
the
one
--
volume
1
of
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
it's
the
preliminary
volume
to
that,
as
i
understand
it.
it's
a
very
thin
volume
of
the
transcript.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
we
--
we'll
lodge
you
our
copy
of
that
transcript
with
the
court
and
the
pages.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
time
remaining
to
respond,
i
will
discuss
the
first
point
that
it
was
brought
up
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
that
was
whether
the
admission
of
the
statements
of
the
co-defendant
king,
with
limiting
instructions
which
statements
implicated
the
defendant
gilbert,
violated
his
right
and
denied
him
a
fair
trial.
it
is
our
position
of
course
that
under
the
limiting
instructions
that
there
was
no
denial
of
a
fair
trial
and
that
the
jury
could
follow
these
instructions
and
it
was
not
that
type
of
a
case
that
they
were
unable
to
--
mr.
william
e.
james
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
there
was
no
issue
raised
in
the
federal
case.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
king
wasn't
involved
in
those
robberies.
they
were
separate
robberies.
king
was
only
involved
in
the
robbery
involving
mutual
savings
of
alhambra,
and
so
it
--
wasn't
involved
in
that
case.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
does
not
bring
--
present
an
occasion
where
this
court
might
want
to
reexamine
the
holding
that
it
made
in
delli
paoli.
we
think
that
the
circumstances
here
quite
clearly
point
out
that
the
jury
in
this
case
was
able
to
follow
the
limiting
instructions
and
we
want
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
these
limiting
instructions
were
very
precise.
they
were
given,
not
at
only
at
the
end
of
the
case,
but
the
admonitions
were
given
to
the
jury
at
the
very
time
the
statements
were
being
introduced.
i
think
the
five
factors,
which
this
court
found
very
important,
delli
paoli
apply
here,
and
that
this
is
even
a
stronger
case
than
delli
paoli.
there
are
certain
considerations
that
we
should
note
here.
in
this
case,
the
two
defendants
were
represented
by
separate
attorneys.
in
fact
that
there
was
a
separability
as
to
them
was
made
evident
to
them
through
out
the
case.
the
defendants
were
represented
as
they
say
by
separate
counsel
and
there
was
no
motion
needed,
pretrial
or
during
the
trial
for
a
separate
trial
and
we
think
this
is
significant
as
the
case
developed.
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
the
co-defendant
king
took
the
stand
and
on
examination
on
the
stand
acknowledged
that
his
statements
were
motivated
by
desire,
to
place
the
(inaudible)
gilbert,
and
to
point
the
finger
of
guilt
at
him.
and
the
district
attorney
didn't
rely
on
this
statement
as
to
gilbert,
in
fact
he
was
discounting
the
statements
of
king
and
discounting
particularly
that
part
of
it
which
would
indicate
that
there
was
compulsion
on
the
part
of
king
because
of
gilbert's
actions
and
the
like.
but
we
think
that
these
are
all
significant
factors
which
would
show
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
introduction
into
this
joint
trial
of
the
statements
of
a
co-defendant
with
these
very
clear
and
explicit
limiting
instructions.
now,
mr.
sokolow
has
briefly
touched
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
the
statement
of
king
to
the
authorities
was
that
he
and
the
co-defendant,
weaver,
the
co-robber
i
should
say,
weaver
who
was
killed
in
this
robbery
had
met
at
a
parole
meeting
and
thereafter,
they
had
discussed
the
stealing
of
the
car
by
king
for
certain
purposes.
and
it
was
agreed
on
the
morning
of
january
the
3rd
1964
that
king
would
steal
a
car.
he
stole
one.
he
met
weaver
and
gilbert.
drove
with
them
up
through
alhambra
and
awaited
for
them
out
there.
his
statement
to
the
officer
was
they
returned
--
weaver
was
bleeding
profusely
and
king
--
gilbert,
according
to
king's
statement,
put
a
gun
up
to
his
stomach
and
told
me,
he'd
better
do
what
he
told
him
to
do,
and
that
he
had
just
killed
a
cop
and
he'd
probably
kill
more
that
day.
and
king
went
with
gilbert
to
gilbert's
apartment
where
apparently
gilbert
made
another
attempt
on
his
life
according
to
king's
statements.
but
thereafter,
king
admitted
that
gilbert
gave
him
$1300
and
king
drove
gilbert
to
a
place
where
he
met
someone
and
king
left.
now
this
was
a
purport
of
king's
statements.
now,
king
took
the
stand
and
testified
insofar
as
it
was
immaterial
to
the
charges,
the
same
as
his
statement.
he
omitted
in
his
testimony
the
reference
to
the
statements
supposedly
made
by
gilbert
that
he
just
shot
a
cop
and
that
he
would
kill
more.
now,
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
when
the
statement
was
introduced
with
limiting
instructions
and
i
think
it
is
significant
at
this
time
to
note
that
at
the
penalty
phase
of
a
trial,
these
statements
were
not
reintroduced
and
that
there
was
no
testimony
by
king
at
the
penalty
phase
and
the
district
attorney
made
no
comment
on
the
statements
of
the
defendant
king.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
under
one
--
penal
code
section
190.1,
in
the
ordinary
case,
unless
there
is
some
unusual
circumstance,
the
jury
that
adheres
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
will
also
determine
a
penalty.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
at
the
penalty
trial,
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
has
been
determined,
the
jury
can
hear
--
the
testimony
concerning
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
the
background
and
history
of
the
defendant
and
any
evidence
in
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
a
penalty.
we
submit
that
at
that
time,
the
people's
testimony
related
to
the
background
and
history
of
this
defendant
gilbert
just
starting
out
with
a
murder
he
committed
when
he
was
serving
time
in
a
state
prison
in
1947,
a
burglary
that
he
committed
in
1960,
when
he
was
--
after
he
was
paroled.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
gilbert.
the
escape
in
1963
and
then
the
series
of
robberies
that
he
started
in
october
of
1963
culminating
in
these
acts
of
violence
that
occurred
on
january
3rd
of
1964.
and
this
is
what
the
jury
heard
in
determining
the
penalty
and
we
don't
understand
this
case
as
being
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
penal
code
section
190.1.
and
we
submit
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
penalty
trial
where
a
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
gilbert
having
already
been
determined
and
that
--
at
the
guilt
trial,
there
was
obviously
no
prejudice
because
there
were
limiting
instructions
and
i
think
there
were
five
factors
in
delli
paoli
which
this
court
dealt
with
very
significant
which
we
feel
exist
in
this
case.
my
first
note
as
i'd
already
indicated
that
the
judge
in
this
case
wasn't
content
with
just
merely
giving
an
instruction
at
the
end
of
the
case,
telling
the
jury
that
the
statements
of
a
co-defendant
made
in
--
not
in
the
presence
of
the
other
defendant
wasn't
binding
on
it.
at
the
very
time
the
statement
was
made
and
this
was
at
the
close
of
the
people's
case
in
chief,
the
counsel
then
representing
gilbert,
when
a
question
was
asked
of
officer
bennett
concerning
king's
statements,
said
i
will
object
to
the
question
your
honor
as
to
the
defendant
gilbert
on
the
ground
that
it
is
hearsay
as
to
him.
and
the
district
attorney
then
said,
the
objection
is
well
taken.
and
the
court
said,
obviously,
it
wouldn't
apply
to
the
defendant
gilbert
and
whatever
is
said
here,
you
are
to
draw
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
defendant
gilbert
and
disregarded
insofar
as
the
defendant
gilbert
is
concerned.
now,
thereafter,
counsel
representing
gilbert
made
a
motion
that
the
references
to
gilbert
be
deleted
in
this
statement
and
the
court
heard
this
and
determined
that
it
wouldn't
be
feasible
to
delete
these
references
by
name
to
gilbert
and
of
--
obviously
of
course
at
that
time,
at
the
end
of
the
people's
case,
with
all
this
eyewitness
identification,
the
identity
of
the
particular
person
namely
gilbert
was
clear
and
the
court
felt
that
it
would
not
be
fair
for
the
declarant
to
delete
it.
however,
it
continued.
i
think
however
at
this
time
in
view
of
the
testimony
of
this
witness,
which
she
has
not
completed
as
yet
that
i
should
inform
you
that
this
testimony
is
not
binding
on
the
defendant
gilbert
in
anyway.
it
is
completely
hearsay
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
you
are
not
to
draw
any
inferences
whatever
from
the
testimony
you've
heard
from
this
witness
as
to
anything
in
connection
with
the
defendant
gilbert.
i
will
warn
you
again
about
this,
but
i
thought
it
would
only
be
fair
that
i
give
you
this
admonition.
and
the
court
continued
to
warn
constantly
during
the
introduction
of
the
statements
and
it
concluded
with
the
instruction
given
both
at
the
guilt
phase
and
at
the
penalty
phase,
that
they
were
not
to
consider
the
statements
of
the
co-defendant
made
outside
of
the
presence.
now,
we
submit
that
this
was
a
very
significant
factor.
we
would
urge
that
in
delli
paoli,
this
court
found
that
the
fact
that
--
in
that
case
the
conspiracy
was
a
simple
one
was
--
and
therefore
the
instruction
would
be
easy
for
the
jury
to
understand
was
an
important
factor.
we
submit
that
the
case,
the
issues
here
was
simple
and
that
the
severability
as
to
the
two
defendants
was
significant.
gilbert
was
the
one
who
entered
the
savings
and
loan,
shot
the
police
officer.
king's
position
was
merely
the
driver
of
the
get-away
car.
we
also
note
that
there
were
separate
attorneys
and
we've
also
mentioned
there
was
no
request
at
anytime
for
a
separate
trial
as
to
these
two
defendants.
now,
the
introduction
of
the
statement
of
king
was
postponed
to
the
end
of
the
government's
case
and
this
court
felt
that
that
was
significant
in
delli
paoli
because
it
made
the
instructions
in
the
admonitions
easier
for
the
jury
to
understand
and
to
apply.
and
the
statement
of
the
co-defendant
in
delli
paoli
merely
corroborated
what
was
already
in
the
governor's
--
government's
case
and
we
submit
that
at
this
stage,
the
jury
obviously
knew
that
gilbert
was
the
man
who
perpetrated
the
robbery
for
all
the
mass
of
eyewitness
identification.
and
they
had
the
confrontation
in
gilbert
which
they
didn't
have
in
delli
paoli
as
i
recall.
and
i
think
the
fifth
factor
which
is
most
important
is
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
jury
was
unable
to
understand
the
admonition
and
the
instruction
of
the
judge.
and
we
think
this
is
significant
here,
what
is
probably
more
significant
is
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
did
not
follow
the
admonition
and
the
instruction
of
the
judge.
and
i
think
the
reference
to
jackson
versus
denno
which
counsel
made
is
inappropriate
because
their
witness,
the
court
was
dealing
with
an
involuntary
confession.
it
didn't
have
an
involuntary
confession
here,
you
had
a
confession
that
was
voluntarily
made
by
the
co-defendant.
and
we
submit
that
in
--
under
such
a
circumstance,
that
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
jackson
wasn't
applicable
and
what
this
court
said
in
the
very
recent
case
of
spencer
versus
texas,
i
think
it's
quite
appropriate
where
an
effort
was
made
to
say
that
a
jury
could
not
understand
it
clear
and
explicit
instruction
to
--
in
spencer,
limit
its
application
as
to
testimony
concerning
the
defendant's
prior
felony
convictions.
and
this
court
said,
it
would
be
extravagant
in
the
extreme
to
take
jackson
as
it
--
evidencing
a
general
distrust
on
the
part
of
this
court,
of
the
ability
of
juries
to
approach
their
test
responsibly
and
to
sort
out
issues
given
to
them
under
proper
instructions
by
the
judge
in
the
criminal
case
or
standing
for
the
proposition
that
limiting
instructions
can
never
purge
the
erroneous
introduction
of
evidence
or
limit
the
evidence
to
its
rightful
purpose.
we
submit
that
the
instructions
in
this
case
and
the
admonitions
in
this
case
certainly
could
lead
the
jury
to
limit
the
application
of
the
statements
of
the
co-defendant
king
and
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall
right
off
and
of
course,
there
were
two
defendants
and
there
were
seven
counts
of
felony
and
i
would
have
to
make
reference
to
the
clerk's
transcript
for
that
period
of
time.
i
don't
think
it
was
any
unusual
period
of
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
they
came
back
and
they
asked
for
instructions.
they
asked
for
the
reading
of
the
testimony,
i
believe,
of
one
of
the
defense
witnesses,
they
asked
for
instructions
as
it
related
to
accomplices
and
to
corroboration
as
i
recall.
they
did
not
ask
for
the
repetition
of
any
instructions
relating
to
what
they
should
do
or
how
they
should
treat
statements
of
a
co-defendant.
and
i
think
those
instructions
were
clear
and
as
this
court
pointed
in
delli
paoli
explicitly.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
reason
for
the
--
in
the
california
supreme
court
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
was
their
application
of
the
dorado
rule,
that
the
record
did
not
show
that
there
had
been
an
admonition
request
--
required
people
versus
dorado
with
which
this
court
is
familiar,
that
the
defendant
could
have
an
attorney
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
this
was
of
course
prior
to
june
13th
of
last
year
and
we
now
know
that
it
was
not
a
federally
compelled
reversal.
mr.
william
e.
james
by
the
man
whose
the
--
king's
co-defendant,
the
declarant's
co-defendant?
mr.
william
e.
james
gilbert,
well
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
state
--
mr.
william
e.
james
because
the
court
felt
that
the
jury
could
follow
the
instructions
in
the
admonition
of
the
court
and
not
apply
the
statement
made
by
the
co-defendant
with
these
limiting
instructions
to
gilbert.
and
that
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
it
had
no
prejudice.
mr.
william
e.
james
because
it
was
not
introduced
this
to
gilbert.
and
the
court
specifically
admonished
the
jury
that
it
was
not
to
be
introduced
as
to
gilbert
and
they
were
not
to
consider
it
or
draw
any
inferences
from
that
testimony
as
it
related
to
gilbert.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
and
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
gilbert
certainly
had
confrontation
which
as
i
recall
in
delli
paoli.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
delli
paoli
did
not
have
confrontation
of
the
co-defendant
whitley
who
didn't
take
the
stand.
so
one
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
big
objections
to
the
introduction
of
hearsay
was
obviated
confrontation
and
the
right
of
cross-examination
under
oath.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
think,
if
we
believe
that
juries
can
follow
simple
and
explicit
instructions,
we
would
find
that
there
was
no
error
here
because
the
jury
was
told
expressly
not
to
consider
this
testimony
as
it
related
to
gilbert.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
it
had
some
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
reversal.
it
was
not
because
king
took
the
stand
and
testified
himself.
that
had
no
relation
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
with
the
reversal
in
king
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
because
of
the
introduction
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
of
those
statements
in
confession.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
would
think
however
the
california
supreme
court,
when
applied
to
harmless
error
rule
where
the
--
its
interpretation
of
the
dorado
was
involved.
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
james
oh,
incidentally,
i
understand
the
court
only
has
one
copy
of
the
record.
we
would
be
very
happy
to
lodge
with
the
court
our
copies
of
the
record
and
while
we
only
have
--
mr.
william
e.
james
maybe
so,
i'll
ask
mr.
sokolow
(voice
overlap)
about
it.
mr.
william
e.
james
we'll
do
that
by
letter?
mr.
william
e.
james
we
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
probably
the
one
--
volume
1
of
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
it's
the
preliminary
volume
to
that,
as
i
understand
it.
it's
a
very
thin
volume
of
the
transcript.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
we
--
we'll
lodge
you
our
copy
of
that
transcript
with
the
court
and
the
pages.
thank
you
your
honors.
