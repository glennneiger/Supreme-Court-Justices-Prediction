mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
will
discuss
the
effect
of
the
co-defendant's
statements
and
i
shall
discuss
the
other
issues
commencing
with
the
lineup.
relative
to
the
lineup
we
believe
the
essential
question
is
this,
whether
petitioner's
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense
was
violated
by
his
being
placed
in
the
lineup
subsequent
to
his
--
to
the
indictment
when
his
counsel
was
not
present
at
which
lineup
he
was
required
to
exhibit
himself
and
speak
for
identification.
our
answer
briefly
is
that
--
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
did
not
apply
to
the
lineup,
there
being
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
but
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor,
by
way
of
factual
background,
mr.
gilbert
was
arrested
in
philadelphia,
february
26,
1964.
he
was
indicted
in
this
case
on
march
10th.
he
was
not
returned
from
philadelphia
to
california
until
march
16th.
counsel
was
appointed
march
18th,
new
counsel
substituted
in
on
march
24th.
the
lineup
took
place
march
26.
three
of
the
seven
eyewitnesses
to
the
robbery
at
the
mutual
savings
and
loan
in
alhambra
which
culminated
in
the
killing
of
officer
davis,
related
that
they
attended
the
lineup.
mrs.
riddle,
ms.
butler,
and
mr.
clark
at
the
penalty
phase,
the
eight
eyewitnesses
who
identified
gilbert
in
connection
with
various
other
robberies
also
related
that
they
attended
the
lineup.
from
the
record
we
have
here,
it
appears
that
the
ten
or
more
so
individuals
in
the
lineup
were
asked
to
move
and
to
speak
for
identification.
what
the
--
i
--
doesn't
appear
that
gilbert
said
anything
of
an
incriminating
nature
that
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
record
is
not
as
precise
on
that
your
honor.
the
only
witnesses
really
that
testified
to
any
details
of
what
happened
were
ms.
butler,
mrs.
riddle,
and
mr.
clark
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
this
was
at
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
they
were
asked
if
--
mr.
gilbert
and
the
others
were
asked
such
question
as,
“do
you
own
an
automobile?
what
type
or
what
make
is
the
automobile?
where
were
you
arrested?”
and
--
now,
in
our
record
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
it's
my
impression
that
the
people
in
the
lineup
were
all
asked
to
move
forward
and
to
answer
certain
questions.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
and
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
testimony?
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
i
think
we
can
glean
that
from
the
testimony
of
these
three
witnesses.
now
as
we
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor
in
connection
with
the
escape
of
the
robbers
and
the
--
relative
to
the
search
and
seizure
point
as
furnishing
officer
nixon
with
information
on
which
to
believe
that
at
least
two
people
had
escaped
in
a
certain
automobile
and
then
he
found
the
wounded
mr.
weaver
in
a
still
another
automobile
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
that
may
be
true
your
honor,
but
the
point
we
believe
is
this
that
nothing
that
mr.
gilbert
responded
as
--
from
our
reversal
of
the
record
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
through
the
witnesses
who
attended
the
lineup.
now,
as
we
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief,
the
federal
case,
gilbert
versus
the
united
states
pertaining
to
the
same
lineup
does
reflect
that
there
was
--
there
were
further
matters
brought
out
at
the
lineup
and
as
counsel
pointed
out
there
--
in
that
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
there
that
people
in
the
audience
called
out,
identifying
numbers.
however,
ms.
butler
in
our
case
and
mrs.
riddle
did
not
have
a
recollection
of
that
taking
place,
that
is
the
people
in
the
audience
called
out
numbers,
i'd
refer
very
briefly
to
reporter's
transcript
page
157
and
pages
356
and
57.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
submit
that
it
was
for
purpose
for
identification
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
believe
this
is
a
traditional
type
of
lineup
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
case
was
submitted
on
the
typewritten
copy
of
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
and
357,
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that
--
those
are
the
only
--
well,
let
me
explained
that
that's
the
--
those
are
the
places
where
ms.
butler
and
mrs.
riddle
respectively
testified
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
recall
hearing
people
from
the
audience
that
called
out
numbers.
as
far
as
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
was
one
of
the
officers,
whether
it
was
specifically
a
police
officer
or
an
fbi
agent,
i
don't
believe
the
record
makes
clear
but
it
--
there
was
a
moderator
as
it
were
who
was
asking
the
questions
and
directing
the
people
who
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
your
honor,
i
--
the
record
doesn't
go
that
far.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
a
proper
question
to
ask
if
--
at
the
lineup
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
at
the
lineup.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
if
that
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
and
if
of
course
--
then
we
might
be
able
to
argue
that
perhaps
that
did
not
violate
his
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
fifth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
of
what?
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
of
course,
if
that
permeated
to
the
eyewitnesses
at
the
lineup,
if
it
were
shown
and
brought
out
that
the
--
then
of
course,
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
fifth
amendment
question
then.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
if
a
person
at
the
lineup
said
he
did
it?
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
doesn't
appear
from
our
record
your
honor,
what
the
answer
was.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
true.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
he
was
--
the
individuals
at
the
lineup
from
our
record
were
asked
such
question
as,
“do
you
own
any
car?
what
is
the
make
of
the
car?”
and
so
on.
what
they
specifically
answered
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
at
least.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
true,
but
then,
we
think
if
that
was
the
case
that
there
is
no
reason
why
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
could
not
have
asked
the
witness
just
what
did
mr.
gilbert
answer.
or
if
the
defense
felt
that
there
was
an
infringement
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights
that
mr.
gilbert
himself
could
have
taken
the
stand
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
voir
dire
and
testified
to
the
effect
that
he
was
asked
to
make
incriminating
statements,
but
our
record
doesn't
disclose
that
that
was
the
case.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
believe
the
record
specifically
shows
that
your
honor.
i
mean
the
cross-examination,
it's
a
--
is
a
rather
sparse
record
as
to
the
details
of
the
lineup
and
the
--
i
think,
the
cross-examination
was
essentially
the
question
--
what
were
the
--
were
you
asked
such
question
--
or
where
the
people
in
the
lineup
asked
such
questions
as,
“what
is
--
did
the
defendant
own
a
car?
what
is
the
make
of
the
car?”
and
so
on.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
--
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
we're
not
contending
that
your
honor,
just
that
the
witnesses
in
our
case
apparently
didn't
have
the
recollection
of
some
of
the
witnesses
in
the
federal
case
or
that
they
were
not
cross-examined
specifically
in
those
respects
as
they
were
in
the
federal
case.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
believe
that
probably
on
the
penalty
phase
that
they
were,
it's
my
impression
from
reading
the
federal
circuit
opinion
that
there
was
some
similarity
as
to
the
things
--
at
least
some
of
the
witnesses,
i
think.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
what
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
in
this
case
by
the
witnesses
who
are
present
at
the
lineup
was
the
crucial
factor.
it's
--
it
was
our
further
feeling
that
actually,
that
is
a
record
in
a
different
case
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
that
we
in
all
candor
did
put
--
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
the
opinion
does
therein
does
refer
to
the
same
lineup.
i
would
think
perhaps
it
would
be
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
it
--
i
know
from
talking
to
a
member
of
the
united
states'
attorney's
office
that
--
he
told
me
that
the
testimony
that
appeared
in
the
opinion
in
the
case
of
gilbert
versus
united
states
was
in
fact
the
testimony
as
it
did
appear
in
the
record
in
that
in
that
case.
so,
i
would
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
that
was
a
prosecution
for
bank
robberies
your
honor,
a
federal
--
a
prosecution
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
about
four
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right,
he
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
and
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
opinion
in
the
federal
case
does
--
i
don't
know
that
it
shows
that
answers
specifically
as
to
what
type
of
automobile
and
so
forth.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right
your
honor.
now,
parenthetically,
petitioner
has
suggested
that
a
state
statute
was
infringed
relative
to
custody
of
prisoners
insofar
as
taking
gilbert
from
the
county
jail
to
the
lineup
at
the
police
station.
well,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
california
supreme
court
indicated
that
if
this
was
the
case,
it
was
immaterial.
now
our
further
study
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
in
any
event,
gilbert
was
not
in
state
custody
then,
but
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
authorities
although
being
housed
at
the
county
jail.
and
we
respectfully
refer
to
the
court
to
pages
66
and
67
of
volume
1
which
contains
the
pretrial
proceedings,
the
previous
reference
was
to
the
transcript
containing
the
testimony
which
commences
with
volume
6.
we
gather
from
the
schmerber
opinion
that
traditionally,
the
lineup
is
considered
an
identification
process
--
that
schmerber
reflects
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
violated
so
long
as
--
at
least
by
that
compulsion
which
makes
the
accused
the
source
of
real
or
physical
evidence
and
so
long
as
he
is
required
to
move
or
to
speak
although
extensively
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
identification,
he
is
exhibiting
physical
characteristics
not
communicating
testimony
only.
we
would
submit
that
identification
processes
whether
they
be
photographic,
taking
fingerprints,
or
displaying
physical
characteristics
at
a
lineup
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
people's
preparation
of
the
case,
traditionally
accomplished
in
private
and
that
governmental
interests
of
reasonable
convenience
and
reasonable
trading
and
preparing
the
people's
case
require
that
such
preparation
not
be
subject
to
curtailment
or
control
by
the
defense.
we
reiterate
that
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
if
there
is
an
infringement
of
the
privilege
against
self
incriminate
--
oh,
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
didn't
hear
you
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
as
to
my
own
personal
impression,
that
most
of
them
occur
before
indictment.
but
in
this
case,
of
course,
mr.
gilbert
was
not
returned
from
philadelphia
to
california
until
after
the
indictment
had
taken
place.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
we
submit
that
if
the
accused
is
not
entitled
to
assert
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
at
the
lineup,
then
of
course,
it
should
be
immaterial
whether
it
occurred
before
or
after
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
he
would
be
excluded
your
honor.
at
least
i
don't
know
of
any
incidences
where
he's
been
admitted
and
the
--
in
the
lopez
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
similar
situation
arose
there
and
the
counsel
was
excluded.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
think
they
customarily
put
the
individual
in
the
lineup
with
enough
others
so
that
there
can
a
fair
testing
of
identification
but
as
to
the
exact
details
on
how
they
are
conducted
i
would
suppose
they're
--
perhaps
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
now,
that
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
confess,
i'm
not
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
think
it
is
perhaps
customary
for
them
to
--
for
all
the
people
in
the
lineup
to
be
as
to
--
try
on
articles
of
clothing
and
as
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
this
lineup
here
basically
was
quite
similar
again
to
that
one
in
the
lopez
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
which
is
a
few
years
ago,
and
another
california
lineup,
much
along
the
same
lines.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
in
this
case,
the
various
witnesses
have
been
shown
photographs.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
this
would
be
framing
it
up
--
yes,
your
honor.
now,
assuming
but
not
conceding
that
some
legal
impropriety
might
have
prepped
into
the
lineup,
would
that
invalidate
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
who
identified
gilbert,
we
submit
it
would
not
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
silverthorn
lumber
company
case
that
knowledge
of
the
facts
is
gained
from
an
independent
source
they
may
be
proved
as
any
others.
the
eyewitnesses
here
did
not
come
into
existence
as
such
because
they
attended
the
lineup
but
because
they
were
present
when
an
offense
was
committed.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
think
that
occur
--
accords
also
with
the
majority
opinion
--
the
opinion
of
the
judge
duniway
in
the
same
case
and
i
certainly
acknowledge
that
there
was
testimony
in
that
federal
case
to
that
effect.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
merely
so
extensive.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
same
lineup.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
don't
think
we
can
say
specifically
from
either
record
precisely
what
each
individual
in
there.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
your
honor,
not
that
i
know
of.
i
--
we
would
like
to
stress
that
trial
judge's
observations
as
to
one
of
the
eyewitnesses,
ms.
butler
--
he
said
--
i
am
saying
she
comes
into
the
courtroom
here
regardless,
if
you
hadn't
any
show
up
here
at
all,
and
this
by
the
way
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
she
comes
into
the
courtroom
here
and
positively
identifies
the
defendant.
i
would
think,
if
i
were
in
the
robbery
she
was
in,
i
would
have
think
that
--
i
would
have
a
pretty
--
i
--
good
idea
of
who
did
it
when
i
saw
him
in
the
courtroom
and
i
think
she
has.
and
we
submit
that
as
to
all
of
the
eyewitnesses
who
identified
gilbert
in
the
courtroom
that
their
testimony
reflected
the
definite
opportunity
on
the
part
of
each
one
to
observe
the
perpetrator
of
the
particular
robbery
and
that
the
people
were
manifestly
relying
on
those
in
court
identifications.
but
going
to
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
submit
that
the
defense
had
made
a
motion
to
exclude
any
testimony
relating
to
the
lineup
or
derived
from
it
on
the
--
and
asked
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
take
the
stand
on
voir
dire
examination
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
relate
just
exactly
what
the
infringement
was.
and
we
do
not
have
that
in
our
case
here.
now
going
on
then
to
the
handwriting
exemplars,
as
counsel
for
petitioner
indicated
yesterday,
there
is
a
certain
similarity
between
the
two
issues.
by
way
of
factual
background,
and
fbi
agent,
mr.
dean
arrested
gilbert
about
9
pm,
february
26th
in
philadelphia.
gilbert
was
surprised
of
his
rights
to
an
attorney
but
he
did
not
have
to
make
any
statements
and
any
statement
he
made
to
be
used
against
him
in
courts.
he
was
transported
downtown
about
three
miles
from
the
arrest
scene.
at
fbi
headquarters,
he
refused
to
discuss
his
activities
on
the
east
or
west
coast
indicating
he
wanted
to
obtain
counsel
before
making
any
statements.
at
10
pm,
another
agent,
mr.
shanahan
spoke
that
mr.
gilbert
again,
telling
him
he
did
not
have
to
make
any
statements
without
the
advice
of
an
attorney
and
any
statement
he
made
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
court
of
law.
shanahan
asked
gilbert
if
he'd
like
to
talk
to
him
and
gilbert
said
he
would,
providing
it
did
not
pertain
to
the
case
in
california.
shanahan
testified
that
he
interviewed
gilbert
according
on
that
basis.
shanahan
was
interested
in
some
robberies
in
philadelphia.
he
was
working
on
them.
demand
notes
had
been
used
in
consummating
those
robberies.
they
have
been
passed
to
the
tellers.
he
asked
gilbert
if
gilbert
would
give
him
some
samples
of
his
hand
printing
and
gilbert
agreed
and
did
so.
now,
shanahan
testified
he
had
no
information.
these
hand
printing
exemplars
were
to
be
used
later
on
in
los
angeles.
however,
it
was
fbi
policy
to
secure
hand
printing
samples
of
all
suspects
in
robberies
and
keep
them
on
file
here
in
washington.
keep
them
on
file
of
samples
of
--
handwriting
samples
of
bank
robberies
throughout
the
country.
it
was
testified
that
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
well
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
your
honor
would
be
mistaken
in
that
the
--
the
lineup
took
place
at
quite
some
while
after
this
interview.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
lineup
took
place
some
while
after
this
interview
at
the
fbi
headquarters
in
philadelphia.
the
lineup
was
march
26
and
this
interview
where
the
handwriting
exemplars
were
given
was
february
26,
in
other
words
about
a
month
earlier.
it
was
on
february
26th
that
gilbert
said
in
effect
he
did
not
want
to
discuss
anything
about
california
but
would
be
willing
to
talk
about
philadelphia
and
that
shanahan
indicated
that
he
is
interested
in
some
bank
robberies
that
had
occurred
in
philadelphia.
he
suspected
that
gilbert
might
be
involved
in
them
and
would
gilbert
talk
about
those
loosely
or
freely
interpreting
the
record.
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
that
discussion
that
gilbert
gave
the
hand
printing
samples
and
the
handwriting
expert
gave
his
qualified
opinion
that
there
was
a
link
between
the
hand
printing
samples
and
the
writing
or
printing
on
a
diagram
of
the
robbery
scene
that
was
found
at
--
in
gilbert's
apartment
in
the
los
angeles
area.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
subsequently,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
about
a
month
subsequently.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
believe
the
record
which
--
well,
there
was
some
evidence
--
effort
by
the
people
as
i
recall
to
introduce
some
statements
that
gilbert
made
and
the
court
excluded
those
statements.
i
would
have
to
double
check
them.
of
course
they
were
excluded
but
i
think
they
were
excluded
on
the
basis
that
gilbert
at
that
time
definitely
indicated
he
wanted
a
counsel.
now,
whether
that
would
give
the
answer
to
your
honor's
questions,
i
don't
this
moment
recall.
well,
the
--
there
was
testimony
at
any
rate
that
the
filing
of
the
hand
printing
samples
here
in
washington
was
in
the
same
category
as
taking
and
keeping
fingerprints
on
file.
and
we
would
submit
that
that's
an
illuminating
piece
of
testimony
that
--
it's
in
the
same
category
as
taking
and
keeping
fingerprints
on
file.
in
other
words,
it
points
up
the
identification
aspect
of
taking
handwriting
exemplars
and
lends
emphasis
to
our
position
that
handwriting
is
no
more
and
no
less
than
an
essential,
physical
characteristic.
we
would
urge
that
the
giving
of
the
exemplars
in
the
case
at
bar
involves
no
testimonial
compulsion
which
is
a
predicate
for
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
gilbert
was
not
required
to
verify
the
authenticity
of
this
hand
printing
on
the
exemplars
that
was
provided
by
agent
shanahan
who's
--
for
whom
gilbert
filled
out
the
exemplars,
and
he
was
not
--
gilbert
was
not
compelled
to
disclose
that
the
writing
on
the
diagram
was
his.
that
was
proved
to
a
qualified
extent
by
the
handwriting
expert.
so,
we
urged
that
giving
exemplars
as
in
the
case
at
bar
involves
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
a
privilege
which
invokes
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
we'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
search
and
seizure
point
by
way
of
factual
background,
just
after
the
shooting
of
officer
davis
at
the
mutual
savings
and
loan,
a
businessman
in
the
area
saw
two
men
running
out
of
the
savings
and
loan
and
then
shortly
saw
a
car
drive
away.
now,
this
man
told
officer
nixon
that
the
persons
--
two
persons
were
in
a
white
pontiac
and
gave
nixon
the
license
number
on
a
slip
of
paper,
nixon
broadcasts
this
information
over
his
police
radio
then
went
in
pursuit.
soon
afterward,
another
person
told
nixon
that
two
men
had
left
a
white
pontiac
and
driven
away
an
oldsmobile.
soon
after,
nixon
came
upon
a
white
pontiac
that
was
parked
and
the
license
number
tallied
with
that
on
the
slip
of
paper.
and
then
soon
afterward,
he
saw
a
chevrolet
automobile
in
which
contained
mr.
weaver
who
as
it
developed
was
mortally
wounded.
well,
weaver
was
taken
to
the
hospital,
interviewed
by
fbi
agent
norton.
after
--
and
norton
kept
in
contact
with
his
office
relative
to
the
information
that
weaver
was
giving
which
information
lead
the
authorities
to
this
apartment
for
the
hawaiian
sounding
name
near
los
feliz
and
riverside
drive
and
the
pursuit
was
so
hot
that
gilbert
or
mr.
flood
as
he
was
known
at
the
apartment
was
apparently
just
leaving
as
the
fbi
agent
kiel
arrived.
other
officers
arrives
shortly
including
agent
schlatter,
where
we
have
testimony
in
the
records
set
out
in
our
brief
as
to
schlatter's
frame
of
mind
when
he
entered
the
apartment
with
a
key.
it
was
his
frame
of
mind
that
the
authorities
had
information
that
there
were
three
robbers,
that
one
was
wounded
and
accounted
for,
that
would
be
weaver,
one
had
left
a
few
minutes
earlier,
and
a
third
was
unaccounted
for
and
might
very
well
be
in
that
apartment
right
then
and
there.
and
of
course,
mr.
schlatter
was
aware
that
a
police
officer
had
been
shot,
and
he
explained
in
his
testimony
the
authorities
were
going
into
a
place
where
there
is
a
man
who
had
just
participated
in
a
bank
robbery
and
might
be
armed,
and
it
was
their
intention
to
take
that
man
into
custody.
so
we
urged
that
the
exigent
circumstances
of
the
robbers
fleeing
in
a
hot
pursuit
justified
the
entry
into
the
apartment
by
means
of
the
key
unannounced.
now,
once
they
were
inside,
the
authorities
observed
some
objects
in
open
view
and
--
or
the
--
with
the
exception
of
some
photographs,
these
were
taken
later
on
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
search
warrants.
now,
the
only
objects
taken
initially
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
a
search
warrant
was
issued
later
in
that
afternoon
and
they
were
taken
pursuant
to
that.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
now
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
--
well,
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
crowley
(ph)
who
testified
--
testimony
goes
that
he
arrived
at
this
apartment
after
he
had
been
searched
for
people.
he
was
instructed
to
look
for
anything
that
could
be
used
to
identify
or
continue
the
pursuit
of
the
person
without
conducting
a
detailed
search.
and
on
top
of
the
dresser
in
the
bedroom,
he
saw
this
envelop
containing
the
name
of
the
photographic
studio
and
it
appeared
to
contain
some
objects
and
looked
inside
and
saw
that
there
were
these
photographs
of
an
individual.
it
was
compared
with
a
mug
shot
and
the
indication
was
that
it
was
of
mr.
gilbert
and
the
--
these
small
photos,
passport
tagged
photos
were
taken
out
to
the
scene
of
the
robbery
and
killing
of
officer
davis,
the
savings
and
loan,
and
the
reproduction
of
one
of
these
photographs
was
shown
to
various
witnesses.
and
we
submit
that
the
reproduction
of
that
photograph
exhibited
to
the
witnesses
there
that
same
day
could
very
well
confirm
or
disprove
the
validity
of
weaver's
lead
and
point
the
direction
in
which
the
authorities
should
concentrate
their
efforts
to
apprehend
the
man
who
fled
after
robbing
the
savings
and
loan
and
killing
officer
davis
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
there
was
ammunition
clip,
some
money,
some
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
a
drawing
of
the
--
there
was
a
notebook
there
containing
a
diagram
of
the
savings
and
loan
area.
there
were
some
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
we
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
they
emphasized
the
hot
pursuit,
the
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
so
they
elaborated
and
went
into,
i
would
say
a
lengthier
discussion
of
it.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous
in
that
phase
of
its
opinion.
that
was
the
phase
of
the
opinion
that
was
written
by
judge
browning,
then
the
rest
of
the
prevailing
opinion,
i
might
say
was
written
by
judge
duniway
and
concurred
in
the
--
by
the
other
circuit
judge
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
and
then
judge
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
barnes,
and
then
judge
browning
dissented
as
to
the
lineup.
that's
some
other
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
the
court
there
was
in
accord
as
to
the
search.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
think
that
would
be
proper
where
if
he
was
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
at
the
lineup
your
honor.
it's
a
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
don't
think
he
should
be
compelled
to
say
anything
or
write
anything
like,
“yes,
i
am
guilty
of
this
crime”,
but
as
far
as
speaking
for
voice
identification
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
or
write
a
sample
of
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
we
would
advert
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
basically
this
is
--
just
in
a
nature
of
an
identification
process
basically
such
as
taking
fingerprint
impressions
of
the
--
that's
been
considered
as
distinct
from
--
or
not
as
critical
shall
we
say
as
requiring
the
individual
to
make
statements
that
are
going
to
incriminate
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
was
helpful
to
the
state
in
identifying
him,
yes,
in
that
sense
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
yes
sir.
yes
your
honor,
in
that
sense,
i
would
agree.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
perhaps
the
compulsion
isn't
the
most
appropriate
word
to
use.
perhaps
he
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
he
was
requested
to
give
handwriting
exemplars
and
the
record
reflects
that
he
voluntarily
gave
them.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
--
you
might
say
that
perhaps
the
--
it
might
be
considered
compulsion
in
that
sense.
but
it's
not
--
we
would
certainly
argue
that
it
was
not
incriminating
in
the
miranda
sense.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
as
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
know
if
i
used
the
most
apt
expression
in
saying
he
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
compelled
to
speak,
he
had
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
he
--
well
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
think
your
honors,
it's
of
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
trial
started
a
little
before
escobedo
came
down
your
honor
and
would
be
our
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
in
other
words
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
there
was
no
force
or
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
there
was
no
(inaudible)
situation.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
again,
the
record
doesn't
clearly
show
that.
he
certainly
didn't
take
the
stand
for
voir
dire
testimony
and
the
--
say
that
i
objected.
now,
at
the
--
there's
a
discussion
between
court
and
counsel
at
recorder's
transcript
pages
194
and
5
in
which
defense
counsel
says
--
said
to
the
court
that
my
client
has
told
me
that
he
told
the
marshals
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
lineup
for
that
was
a
fifth
amendment
violation
and
they
did
--
i'm
interpreting
the
record
freely
here,
not
verbatim.
but
the
deputy
district
attorney
said,
well,
i
would
concede
that
that
is
what
your
client
told
you.
i
won't
necessarily
assume
that
that
is
actually
the
case
and
as
i
recall
the
record,
it
was
just
left
at
that.
as
i
say,
there
was
no
voir
dire
testimony
by
gilbert
himself
that
he
had
refused
to
be
taken
from
his
cell
to
go
to
the
lineup.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
would
submit
that
if
he
is
not
saying
anything
incriminating
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
to
be
used
against
him
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
at
the
trial
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
true
your
honor.
but
is
voice
really
anymore
than
an
essential
physical
characteristic,
is
anymore
let
us
say
then
a
facial
expression
generally
or
the
way
a
person
walks,
moves
about,
when
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
he
did
not
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that
is
one
of
our
answers
and
he
did
not
come
--
claim
on
voir
dire
that
there
was
any
violation
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
he
--
i
would
say
that
he
could
certainly
do
it
during
the
trial.
in
fact
in
this
case,
there
was
some
voir
dire
on
the
part
of
gilbert
himself
relative
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
giving
of
the
handwriting
exemplars
so,
i
would
say
he
could
certainly
do
it
then.
i
--
whether
he
--
of
course
he
can
bring
a
--
make
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
on
search
and
seizure
grounds,
perhaps
it
could
be
extended
to
this
situation
too,
but
the
point
that
i
was
stressing
is
that
there
--
appears
to
have
been
no
indication
that
such
was
desired
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
california
law
precisely
on
the
subject,
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
he
could
do
it
at
the
trial.
in
fact,
there
was
some
just
--
in
this
colloquy
that
i
was
referring
to
between
counsels.
there
were
some
that
was
referenced
by
defense
counsel
that
well,
maybe
we
might
be
able
to
find
the
marshal
and
bring
him
in
to
testify,
in
other
words,
by
voir
dire,
there
were
certainly
no
indication
that
they
couldn't
have
--
i
would
say
that
if
gilbert
or
u.s.
marshal
had
been
found
that
the
--
they
could've
had
some
voir
dire
there.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
perhaps
not
if
the
--
would
just
be
my
impression
that
certainly
the
defense
could
bring
such
a
motion
and
i
don't
--
couldn't
guarantee
that
the
trial
court
would
necessarily
entertain
it
before
the
trial
but
i
think
the
court
certainly
would
consider
it
during
the
trial.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
thank
you.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
will
discuss
the
effect
of
the
co-defendant's
statements
and
i
shall
discuss
the
other
issues
commencing
with
the
lineup.
relative
to
the
lineup
we
believe
the
essential
question
is
this,
whether
petitioner's
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense
was
violated
by
his
being
placed
in
the
lineup
subsequent
to
his
--
to
the
indictment
when
his
counsel
was
not
present
at
which
lineup
he
was
required
to
exhibit
himself
and
speak
for
identification.
our
answer
briefly
is
that
--
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
did
not
apply
to
the
lineup,
there
being
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
but
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor,
by
way
of
factual
background,
mr.
gilbert
was
arrested
in
philadelphia,
february
26,
1964.
he
was
indicted
in
this
case
on
march
10th.
he
was
not
returned
from
philadelphia
to
california
until
march
16th.
counsel
was
appointed
march
18th,
new
counsel
substituted
in
on
march
24th.
the
lineup
took
place
march
26.
three
of
the
seven
eyewitnesses
to
the
robbery
at
the
mutual
savings
and
loan
in
alhambra
which
culminated
in
the
killing
of
officer
davis,
related
that
they
attended
the
lineup.
mrs.
riddle,
ms.
butler,
and
mr.
clark
at
the
penalty
phase,
the
eight
eyewitnesses
who
identified
gilbert
in
connection
with
various
other
robberies
also
related
that
they
attended
the
lineup.
from
the
record
we
have
here,
it
appears
that
the
ten
or
more
so
individuals
in
the
lineup
were
asked
to
move
and
to
speak
for
identification.
what
the
--
i
--
doesn't
appear
that
gilbert
said
anything
of
an
incriminating
nature
that
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
record
is
not
as
precise
on
that
your
honor.
the
only
witnesses
really
that
testified
to
any
details
of
what
happened
were
ms.
butler,
mrs.
riddle,
and
mr.
clark
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
this
was
at
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
they
were
asked
if
--
mr.
gilbert
and
the
others
were
asked
such
question
as,
“do
you
own
an
automobile?
what
type
or
what
make
is
the
automobile?
where
were
you
arrested?”
and
--
now,
in
our
record
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
it's
my
impression
that
the
people
in
the
lineup
were
all
asked
to
move
forward
and
to
answer
certain
questions.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
and
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
testimony?
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
i
think
we
can
glean
that
from
the
testimony
of
these
three
witnesses.
now
as
we
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor
in
connection
with
the
escape
of
the
robbers
and
the
--
relative
to
the
search
and
seizure
point
as
furnishing
officer
nixon
with
information
on
which
to
believe
that
at
least
two
people
had
escaped
in
a
certain
automobile
and
then
he
found
the
wounded
mr.
weaver
in
a
still
another
automobile
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
that
may
be
true
your
honor,
but
the
point
we
believe
is
this
that
nothing
that
mr.
gilbert
responded
as
--
from
our
reversal
of
the
record
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
through
the
witnesses
who
attended
the
lineup.
now,
as
we
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief,
the
federal
case,
gilbert
versus
the
united
states
pertaining
to
the
same
lineup
does
reflect
that
there
was
--
there
were
further
matters
brought
out
at
the
lineup
and
as
counsel
pointed
out
there
--
in
that
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
there
that
people
in
the
audience
called
out,
identifying
numbers.
however,
ms.
butler
in
our
case
and
mrs.
riddle
did
not
have
a
recollection
of
that
taking
place,
that
is
the
people
in
the
audience
called
out
numbers,
i'd
refer
very
briefly
to
reporter's
transcript
page
157
and
pages
356
and
57.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
submit
that
it
was
for
purpose
for
identification
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
believe
this
is
a
traditional
type
of
lineup
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
case
was
submitted
on
the
typewritten
copy
of
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
and
357,
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that
--
those
are
the
only
--
well,
let
me
explained
that
that's
the
--
those
are
the
places
where
ms.
butler
and
mrs.
riddle
respectively
testified
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
recall
hearing
people
from
the
audience
that
called
out
numbers.
as
far
as
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
was
one
of
the
officers,
whether
it
was
specifically
a
police
officer
or
an
fbi
agent,
i
don't
believe
the
record
makes
clear
but
it
--
there
was
a
moderator
as
it
were
who
was
asking
the
questions
and
directing
the
people
who
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
your
honor,
i
--
the
record
doesn't
go
that
far.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
a
proper
question
to
ask
if
--
at
the
lineup
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
at
the
lineup.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
if
that
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
and
if
of
course
--
then
we
might
be
able
to
argue
that
perhaps
that
did
not
violate
his
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
fifth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
of
what?
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
of
course,
if
that
permeated
to
the
eyewitnesses
at
the
lineup,
if
it
were
shown
and
brought
out
that
the
--
then
of
course,
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
fifth
amendment
question
then.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
if
a
person
at
the
lineup
said
he
did
it?
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
doesn't
appear
from
our
record
your
honor,
what
the
answer
was.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
true.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
he
was
--
the
individuals
at
the
lineup
from
our
record
were
asked
such
question
as,
“do
you
own
any
car?
what
is
the
make
of
the
car?”
and
so
on.
what
they
specifically
answered
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
at
least.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
true,
but
then,
we
think
if
that
was
the
case
that
there
is
no
reason
why
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
could
not
have
asked
the
witness
just
what
did
mr.
gilbert
answer.
or
if
the
defense
felt
that
there
was
an
infringement
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights
that
mr.
gilbert
himself
could
have
taken
the
stand
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
voir
dire
and
testified
to
the
effect
that
he
was
asked
to
make
incriminating
statements,
but
our
record
doesn't
disclose
that
that
was
the
case.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
believe
the
record
specifically
shows
that
your
honor.
i
mean
the
cross-examination,
it's
a
--
is
a
rather
sparse
record
as
to
the
details
of
the
lineup
and
the
--
i
think,
the
cross-examination
was
essentially
the
question
--
what
were
the
--
were
you
asked
such
question
--
or
where
the
people
in
the
lineup
asked
such
questions
as,
“what
is
--
did
the
defendant
own
a
car?
what
is
the
make
of
the
car?”
and
so
on.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
--
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
we're
not
contending
that
your
honor,
just
that
the
witnesses
in
our
case
apparently
didn't
have
the
recollection
of
some
of
the
witnesses
in
the
federal
case
or
that
they
were
not
cross-examined
specifically
in
those
respects
as
they
were
in
the
federal
case.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
believe
that
probably
on
the
penalty
phase
that
they
were,
it's
my
impression
from
reading
the
federal
circuit
opinion
that
there
was
some
similarity
as
to
the
things
--
at
least
some
of
the
witnesses,
i
think.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
what
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
in
this
case
by
the
witnesses
who
are
present
at
the
lineup
was
the
crucial
factor.
it's
--
it
was
our
further
feeling
that
actually,
that
is
a
record
in
a
different
case
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
that
we
in
all
candor
did
put
--
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
the
opinion
does
therein
does
refer
to
the
same
lineup.
i
would
think
perhaps
it
would
be
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
it
--
i
know
from
talking
to
a
member
of
the
united
states'
attorney's
office
that
--
he
told
me
that
the
testimony
that
appeared
in
the
opinion
in
the
case
of
gilbert
versus
united
states
was
in
fact
the
testimony
as
it
did
appear
in
the
record
in
that
in
that
case.
so,
i
would
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
that
was
a
prosecution
for
bank
robberies
your
honor,
a
federal
--
a
prosecution
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
about
four
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right,
he
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
and
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
opinion
in
the
federal
case
does
--
i
don't
know
that
it
shows
that
answers
specifically
as
to
what
type
of
automobile
and
so
forth.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
right
your
honor.
now,
parenthetically,
petitioner
has
suggested
that
a
state
statute
was
infringed
relative
to
custody
of
prisoners
insofar
as
taking
gilbert
from
the
county
jail
to
the
lineup
at
the
police
station.
well,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
california
supreme
court
indicated
that
if
this
was
the
case,
it
was
immaterial.
now
our
further
study
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
in
any
event,
gilbert
was
not
in
state
custody
then,
but
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
authorities
although
being
housed
at
the
county
jail.
and
we
respectfully
refer
to
the
court
to
pages
66
and
67
of
volume
1
which
contains
the
pretrial
proceedings,
the
previous
reference
was
to
the
transcript
containing
the
testimony
which
commences
with
volume
6.
we
gather
from
the
schmerber
opinion
that
traditionally,
the
lineup
is
considered
an
identification
process
--
that
schmerber
reflects
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
violated
so
long
as
--
at
least
by
that
compulsion
which
makes
the
accused
the
source
of
real
or
physical
evidence
and
so
long
as
he
is
required
to
move
or
to
speak
although
extensively
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
identification,
he
is
exhibiting
physical
characteristics
not
communicating
testimony
only.
we
would
submit
that
identification
processes
whether
they
be
photographic,
taking
fingerprints,
or
displaying
physical
characteristics
at
a
lineup
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
people's
preparation
of
the
case,
traditionally
accomplished
in
private
and
that
governmental
interests
of
reasonable
convenience
and
reasonable
trading
and
preparing
the
people's
case
require
that
such
preparation
not
be
subject
to
curtailment
or
control
by
the
defense.
we
reiterate
that
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
if
there
is
an
infringement
of
the
privilege
against
self
incriminate
--
oh,
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
didn't
hear
you
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
as
to
my
own
personal
impression,
that
most
of
them
occur
before
indictment.
but
in
this
case,
of
course,
mr.
gilbert
was
not
returned
from
philadelphia
to
california
until
after
the
indictment
had
taken
place.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
we
submit
that
if
the
accused
is
not
entitled
to
assert
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
at
the
lineup,
then
of
course,
it
should
be
immaterial
whether
it
occurred
before
or
after
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
he
would
be
excluded
your
honor.
at
least
i
don't
know
of
any
incidences
where
he's
been
admitted
and
the
--
in
the
lopez
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
similar
situation
arose
there
and
the
counsel
was
excluded.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
think
they
customarily
put
the
individual
in
the
lineup
with
enough
others
so
that
there
can
a
fair
testing
of
identification
but
as
to
the
exact
details
on
how
they
are
conducted
i
would
suppose
they're
--
perhaps
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
now,
that
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
confess,
i'm
not
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
think
it
is
perhaps
customary
for
them
to
--
for
all
the
people
in
the
lineup
to
be
as
to
--
try
on
articles
of
clothing
and
as
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
this
lineup
here
basically
was
quite
similar
again
to
that
one
in
the
lopez
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
which
is
a
few
years
ago,
and
another
california
lineup,
much
along
the
same
lines.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
in
this
case,
the
various
witnesses
have
been
shown
photographs.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
this
would
be
framing
it
up
--
yes,
your
honor.
now,
assuming
but
not
conceding
that
some
legal
impropriety
might
have
prepped
into
the
lineup,
would
that
invalidate
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
who
identified
gilbert,
we
submit
it
would
not
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
silverthorn
lumber
company
case
that
knowledge
of
the
facts
is
gained
from
an
independent
source
they
may
be
proved
as
any
others.
the
eyewitnesses
here
did
not
come
into
existence
as
such
because
they
attended
the
lineup
but
because
they
were
present
when
an
offense
was
committed.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
think
that
occur
--
accords
also
with
the
majority
opinion
--
the
opinion
of
the
judge
duniway
in
the
same
case
and
i
certainly
acknowledge
that
there
was
testimony
in
that
federal
case
to
that
effect.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
merely
so
extensive.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
same
lineup.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
don't
think
we
can
say
specifically
from
either
record
precisely
what
each
individual
in
there.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
your
honor,
not
that
i
know
of.
i
--
we
would
like
to
stress
that
trial
judge's
observations
as
to
one
of
the
eyewitnesses,
ms.
butler
--
he
said
--
i
am
saying
she
comes
into
the
courtroom
here
regardless,
if
you
hadn't
any
show
up
here
at
all,
and
this
by
the
way
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
she
comes
into
the
courtroom
here
and
positively
identifies
the
defendant.
i
would
think,
if
i
were
in
the
robbery
she
was
in,
i
would
have
think
that
--
i
would
have
a
pretty
--
i
--
good
idea
of
who
did
it
when
i
saw
him
in
the
courtroom
and
i
think
she
has.
and
we
submit
that
as
to
all
of
the
eyewitnesses
who
identified
gilbert
in
the
courtroom
that
their
testimony
reflected
the
definite
opportunity
on
the
part
of
each
one
to
observe
the
perpetrator
of
the
particular
robbery
and
that
the
people
were
manifestly
relying
on
those
in
court
identifications.
but
going
to
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
submit
that
the
defense
had
made
a
motion
to
exclude
any
testimony
relating
to
the
lineup
or
derived
from
it
on
the
--
and
asked
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
take
the
stand
on
voir
dire
examination
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
relate
just
exactly
what
the
infringement
was.
and
we
do
not
have
that
in
our
case
here.
now
going
on
then
to
the
handwriting
exemplars,
as
counsel
for
petitioner
indicated
yesterday,
there
is
a
certain
similarity
between
the
two
issues.
by
way
of
factual
background,
and
fbi
agent,
mr.
dean
arrested
gilbert
about
9
pm,
february
26th
in
philadelphia.
gilbert
was
surprised
of
his
rights
to
an
attorney
but
he
did
not
have
to
make
any
statements
and
any
statement
he
made
to
be
used
against
him
in
courts.
he
was
transported
downtown
about
three
miles
from
the
arrest
scene.
at
fbi
headquarters,
he
refused
to
discuss
his
activities
on
the
east
or
west
coast
indicating
he
wanted
to
obtain
counsel
before
making
any
statements.
at
10
pm,
another
agent,
mr.
shanahan
spoke
that
mr.
gilbert
again,
telling
him
he
did
not
have
to
make
any
statements
without
the
advice
of
an
attorney
and
any
statement
he
made
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
court
of
law.
shanahan
asked
gilbert
if
he'd
like
to
talk
to
him
and
gilbert
said
he
would,
providing
it
did
not
pertain
to
the
case
in
california.
shanahan
testified
that
he
interviewed
gilbert
according
on
that
basis.
shanahan
was
interested
in
some
robberies
in
philadelphia.
he
was
working
on
them.
demand
notes
had
been
used
in
consummating
those
robberies.
they
have
been
passed
to
the
tellers.
he
asked
gilbert
if
gilbert
would
give
him
some
samples
of
his
hand
printing
and
gilbert
agreed
and
did
so.
now,
shanahan
testified
he
had
no
information.
these
hand
printing
exemplars
were
to
be
used
later
on
in
los
angeles.
however,
it
was
fbi
policy
to
secure
hand
printing
samples
of
all
suspects
in
robberies
and
keep
them
on
file
here
in
washington.
keep
them
on
file
of
samples
of
--
handwriting
samples
of
bank
robberies
throughout
the
country.
it
was
testified
that
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
well
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
your
honor
would
be
mistaken
in
that
the
--
the
lineup
took
place
at
quite
some
while
after
this
interview.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
lineup
took
place
some
while
after
this
interview
at
the
fbi
headquarters
in
philadelphia.
the
lineup
was
march
26
and
this
interview
where
the
handwriting
exemplars
were
given
was
february
26,
in
other
words
about
a
month
earlier.
it
was
on
february
26th
that
gilbert
said
in
effect
he
did
not
want
to
discuss
anything
about
california
but
would
be
willing
to
talk
about
philadelphia
and
that
shanahan
indicated
that
he
is
interested
in
some
bank
robberies
that
had
occurred
in
philadelphia.
he
suspected
that
gilbert
might
be
involved
in
them
and
would
gilbert
talk
about
those
loosely
or
freely
interpreting
the
record.
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
that
discussion
that
gilbert
gave
the
hand
printing
samples
and
the
handwriting
expert
gave
his
qualified
opinion
that
there
was
a
link
between
the
hand
printing
samples
and
the
writing
or
printing
on
a
diagram
of
the
robbery
scene
that
was
found
at
--
in
gilbert's
apartment
in
the
los
angeles
area.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
subsequently,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
about
a
month
subsequently.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
believe
the
record
which
--
well,
there
was
some
evidence
--
effort
by
the
people
as
i
recall
to
introduce
some
statements
that
gilbert
made
and
the
court
excluded
those
statements.
i
would
have
to
double
check
them.
of
course
they
were
excluded
but
i
think
they
were
excluded
on
the
basis
that
gilbert
at
that
time
definitely
indicated
he
wanted
a
counsel.
now,
whether
that
would
give
the
answer
to
your
honor's
questions,
i
don't
this
moment
recall.
well,
the
--
there
was
testimony
at
any
rate
that
the
filing
of
the
hand
printing
samples
here
in
washington
was
in
the
same
category
as
taking
and
keeping
fingerprints
on
file.
and
we
would
submit
that
that's
an
illuminating
piece
of
testimony
that
--
it's
in
the
same
category
as
taking
and
keeping
fingerprints
on
file.
in
other
words,
it
points
up
the
identification
aspect
of
taking
handwriting
exemplars
and
lends
emphasis
to
our
position
that
handwriting
is
no
more
and
no
less
than
an
essential,
physical
characteristic.
we
would
urge
that
the
giving
of
the
exemplars
in
the
case
at
bar
involves
no
testimonial
compulsion
which
is
a
predicate
for
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
gilbert
was
not
required
to
verify
the
authenticity
of
this
hand
printing
on
the
exemplars
that
was
provided
by
agent
shanahan
who's
--
for
whom
gilbert
filled
out
the
exemplars,
and
he
was
not
--
gilbert
was
not
compelled
to
disclose
that
the
writing
on
the
diagram
was
his.
that
was
proved
to
a
qualified
extent
by
the
handwriting
expert.
so,
we
urged
that
giving
exemplars
as
in
the
case
at
bar
involves
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
a
privilege
which
invokes
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
we'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
search
and
seizure
point
by
way
of
factual
background,
just
after
the
shooting
of
officer
davis
at
the
mutual
savings
and
loan,
a
businessman
in
the
area
saw
two
men
running
out
of
the
savings
and
loan
and
then
shortly
saw
a
car
drive
away.
now,
this
man
told
officer
nixon
that
the
persons
--
two
persons
were
in
a
white
pontiac
and
gave
nixon
the
license
number
on
a
slip
of
paper,
nixon
broadcasts
this
information
over
his
police
radio
then
went
in
pursuit.
soon
afterward,
another
person
told
nixon
that
two
men
had
left
a
white
pontiac
and
driven
away
an
oldsmobile.
soon
after,
nixon
came
upon
a
white
pontiac
that
was
parked
and
the
license
number
tallied
with
that
on
the
slip
of
paper.
and
then
soon
afterward,
he
saw
a
chevrolet
automobile
in
which
contained
mr.
weaver
who
as
it
developed
was
mortally
wounded.
well,
weaver
was
taken
to
the
hospital,
interviewed
by
fbi
agent
norton.
after
--
and
norton
kept
in
contact
with
his
office
relative
to
the
information
that
weaver
was
giving
which
information
lead
the
authorities
to
this
apartment
for
the
hawaiian
sounding
name
near
los
feliz
and
riverside
drive
and
the
pursuit
was
so
hot
that
gilbert
or
mr.
flood
as
he
was
known
at
the
apartment
was
apparently
just
leaving
as
the
fbi
agent
kiel
arrived.
other
officers
arrives
shortly
including
agent
schlatter,
where
we
have
testimony
in
the
records
set
out
in
our
brief
as
to
schlatter's
frame
of
mind
when
he
entered
the
apartment
with
a
key.
it
was
his
frame
of
mind
that
the
authorities
had
information
that
there
were
three
robbers,
that
one
was
wounded
and
accounted
for,
that
would
be
weaver,
one
had
left
a
few
minutes
earlier,
and
a
third
was
unaccounted
for
and
might
very
well
be
in
that
apartment
right
then
and
there.
and
of
course,
mr.
schlatter
was
aware
that
a
police
officer
had
been
shot,
and
he
explained
in
his
testimony
the
authorities
were
going
into
a
place
where
there
is
a
man
who
had
just
participated
in
a
bank
robbery
and
might
be
armed,
and
it
was
their
intention
to
take
that
man
into
custody.
so
we
urged
that
the
exigent
circumstances
of
the
robbers
fleeing
in
a
hot
pursuit
justified
the
entry
into
the
apartment
by
means
of
the
key
unannounced.
now,
once
they
were
inside,
the
authorities
observed
some
objects
in
open
view
and
--
or
the
--
with
the
exception
of
some
photographs,
these
were
taken
later
on
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
search
warrants.
now,
the
only
objects
taken
initially
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes.
a
search
warrant
was
issued
later
in
that
afternoon
and
they
were
taken
pursuant
to
that.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
now
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
--
well,
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
crowley
(ph)
who
testified
--
testimony
goes
that
he
arrived
at
this
apartment
after
he
had
been
searched
for
people.
he
was
instructed
to
look
for
anything
that
could
be
used
to
identify
or
continue
the
pursuit
of
the
person
without
conducting
a
detailed
search.
and
on
top
of
the
dresser
in
the
bedroom,
he
saw
this
envelop
containing
the
name
of
the
photographic
studio
and
it
appeared
to
contain
some
objects
and
looked
inside
and
saw
that
there
were
these
photographs
of
an
individual.
it
was
compared
with
a
mug
shot
and
the
indication
was
that
it
was
of
mr.
gilbert
and
the
--
these
small
photos,
passport
tagged
photos
were
taken
out
to
the
scene
of
the
robbery
and
killing
of
officer
davis,
the
savings
and
loan,
and
the
reproduction
of
one
of
these
photographs
was
shown
to
various
witnesses.
and
we
submit
that
the
reproduction
of
that
photograph
exhibited
to
the
witnesses
there
that
same
day
could
very
well
confirm
or
disprove
the
validity
of
weaver's
lead
and
point
the
direction
in
which
the
authorities
should
concentrate
their
efforts
to
apprehend
the
man
who
fled
after
robbing
the
savings
and
loan
and
killing
officer
davis
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
there
was
ammunition
clip,
some
money,
some
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
a
drawing
of
the
--
there
was
a
notebook
there
containing
a
diagram
of
the
savings
and
loan
area.
there
were
some
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
we
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
they
emphasized
the
hot
pursuit,
the
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
so
they
elaborated
and
went
into,
i
would
say
a
lengthier
discussion
of
it.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous
in
that
phase
of
its
opinion.
that
was
the
phase
of
the
opinion
that
was
written
by
judge
browning,
then
the
rest
of
the
prevailing
opinion,
i
might
say
was
written
by
judge
duniway
and
concurred
in
the
--
by
the
other
circuit
judge
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
and
then
judge
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
barnes,
and
then
judge
browning
dissented
as
to
the
lineup.
that's
some
other
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
the
court
there
was
in
accord
as
to
the
search.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
think
that
would
be
proper
where
if
he
was
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
at
the
lineup
your
honor.
it's
a
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
oh,
i
don't
think
he
should
be
compelled
to
say
anything
or
write
anything
like,
“yes,
i
am
guilty
of
this
crime”,
but
as
far
as
speaking
for
voice
identification
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
or
write
a
sample
of
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
we
would
advert
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
basically
this
is
--
just
in
a
nature
of
an
identification
process
basically
such
as
taking
fingerprint
impressions
of
the
--
that's
been
considered
as
distinct
from
--
or
not
as
critical
shall
we
say
as
requiring
the
individual
to
make
statements
that
are
going
to
incriminate
him
at
the
trial.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
it
was
helpful
to
the
state
in
identifying
him,
yes,
in
that
sense
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
yes
sir.
yes
your
honor,
in
that
sense,
i
would
agree.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
perhaps
the
compulsion
isn't
the
most
appropriate
word
to
use.
perhaps
he
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
he
was
requested
to
give
handwriting
exemplars
and
the
record
reflects
that
he
voluntarily
gave
them.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
--
you
might
say
that
perhaps
the
--
it
might
be
considered
compulsion
in
that
sense.
but
it's
not
--
we
would
certainly
argue
that
it
was
not
incriminating
in
the
miranda
sense.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
as
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
don't
know
if
i
used
the
most
apt
expression
in
saying
he
was
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
compelled
to
speak,
he
had
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
he
--
well
i
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
i
think
your
honors,
it's
of
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
the
trial
started
a
little
before
escobedo
came
down
your
honor
and
would
be
our
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
in
other
words
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
there
was
no
force
or
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
there
was
no
(inaudible)
situation.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
again,
the
record
doesn't
clearly
show
that.
he
certainly
didn't
take
the
stand
for
voir
dire
testimony
and
the
--
say
that
i
objected.
now,
at
the
--
there's
a
discussion
between
court
and
counsel
at
recorder's
transcript
pages
194
and
5
in
which
defense
counsel
says
--
said
to
the
court
that
my
client
has
told
me
that
he
told
the
marshals
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
lineup
for
that
was
a
fifth
amendment
violation
and
they
did
--
i'm
interpreting
the
record
freely
here,
not
verbatim.
but
the
deputy
district
attorney
said,
well,
i
would
concede
that
that
is
what
your
client
told
you.
i
won't
necessarily
assume
that
that
is
actually
the
case
and
as
i
recall
the
record,
it
was
just
left
at
that.
as
i
say,
there
was
no
voir
dire
testimony
by
gilbert
himself
that
he
had
refused
to
be
taken
from
his
cell
to
go
to
the
lineup.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
would
submit
that
if
he
is
not
saying
anything
incriminating
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
to
be
used
against
him
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
--
at
the
trial
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
true
your
honor.
but
is
voice
really
anymore
than
an
essential
physical
characteristic,
is
anymore
let
us
say
then
a
facial
expression
generally
or
the
way
a
person
walks,
moves
about,
when
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
yes
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
no,
he
did
not
--
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
that
is
one
of
our
answers
and
he
did
not
come
--
claim
on
voir
dire
that
there
was
any
violation
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
he
--
i
would
say
that
he
could
certainly
do
it
during
the
trial.
in
fact
in
this
case,
there
was
some
voir
dire
on
the
part
of
gilbert
himself
relative
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
giving
of
the
handwriting
exemplars
so,
i
would
say
he
could
certainly
do
it
then.
i
--
whether
he
--
of
course
he
can
bring
a
--
make
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
on
search
and
seizure
grounds,
perhaps
it
could
be
extended
to
this
situation
too,
but
the
point
that
i
was
stressing
is
that
there
--
appears
to
have
been
no
indication
that
such
was
desired
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
california
law
precisely
on
the
subject,
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
he
could
do
it
at
the
trial.
in
fact,
there
was
some
just
--
in
this
colloquy
that
i
was
referring
to
between
counsels.
there
were
some
that
was
referenced
by
defense
counsel
that
well,
maybe
we
might
be
able
to
find
the
marshal
and
bring
him
in
to
testify,
in
other
words,
by
voir
dire,
there
were
certainly
no
indication
that
they
couldn't
have
--
i
would
say
that
if
gilbert
or
u.s.
marshal
had
been
found
that
the
--
they
could've
had
some
voir
dire
there.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
well,
perhaps
not
if
the
--
would
just
be
my
impression
that
certainly
the
defense
could
bring
such
a
motion
and
i
don't
--
couldn't
guarantee
that
the
trial
court
would
necessarily
entertain
it
before
the
trial
but
i
think
the
court
certainly
would
consider
it
during
the
trial.
mr.
norman
h.
sokolow
thank
you.
