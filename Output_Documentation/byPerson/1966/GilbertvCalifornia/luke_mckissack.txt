mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
undoubtedly
knows,
the
certiorari
was
granted
on
four
different
grounds
and
i
would
propose
to
merely
highlight
what
counsel
estimates
be
the
pivotal
concerns
in
each
one
of
these
contentions
which
we
have
brought
before
this
court
commencing
first
with
the
question
of
the
confession
by
co-defendant
in
whether
or
not
limiting
instructions
to
the
jury
would
be
sufficient
to
eliminate
any
potential
prejudice.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
was
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
i'm
almost
positive.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i'm
almost
positive
that
it
was
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
of
course
i
could
be
mistaken.
the
first
issue
within
be
the
question
of
a
confession
of
the
--
of
a
co-defendant
in
whether
or
not
it
could
be
limited
to
the
declarant
not
to
a
non-declarant
not
used
against
him.
then,
the
duo
counsel
in
fifth
amendment
questions
first,
the
lineup
issue
and
in
the
issue
of
handwriting
exemplars
and
if
time
permits,
i
would
then
like
to
reach
the
issue
of
search
and
seizure
and
the
comp
--
and
the
effects
of
a
violation
if
there
was
in
fact
a
violation
of
search
and
seizure
laws.
now,
first
directing
my
attention
to
the
question
of
the
confession
issue
and
as
used
against
the
co-defendant,
i
would
point
out
that
i
think
that
the
reason
--
array
of
judicial
decisions
and
the
court's
own
judicial
intuition
would
point
out
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
troublesome
spots
of
a
law.
if
we
were
to
single
out
any
particular
problem
where
limiting
instructions
are
demonstrably
insufficient,
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
the
area
where
you
have
a
joint
trial
with
two
defendants
and
in
this
case
both
on
trial
for
their
lives
and
we
have
a
confession,
a
complete
confession
by
one
which
it
implicates
the
other
man.
and
in
this
case
not
only
implicates
him
but
you
have
statements
made
which
are
brought
in
against
only
the
co-defendant
king
here
which
purports
to
say
that
gilbert
admitted
killing
a
police
officer
and
said,
before
he
was
finished,
he
was
going
to
kill
some
more.
further
statement
showing
that
gilbert
attempted
to
kill
his
co-defendant
after
the
completion
of
the
bank
robbery.
i
think
this
is
particularly
pertinent
if
we
view
this
as
it
is,
a
death
penalty
case
against
the
background
of
california
penal
code
statute
190.1
which
is
erroneously
printed
in
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
is
i
think
1900
or
9090
but
190.1
which
throws
the
death
penalty
versus
life
imprisonment
issue
in
california
completely
in
the
lap
of
the
jury
without
any
kind
of
criteria
whatsoever.
they
have
a
complete
freehand
to
consider
all
factors
and
mitigation,
all
factors
and
aggravation
and
then
arrive
upon
a
decision
with
no
reasonable
doubt
criteria
or
anything,
a
complete
decision,
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
man
should
live
or
die.
and
we
have
brought
before
the
jury
something
that
would
otherwise
be
inadmissible
if
it
were
not
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
joint
trial.
but
being
a
joint
trial,
the
jury
heard
the
same
jury
that
decided
the
guilt
of
this
man
and
had
to
adjudicate
or
had
to
decide
the
penalty
also
heard
the
statement
which
set
in
effect
that
this
man
had
killed
the
policeman
and
was
going
to
kill
more.
and
i
can't
imagine
anything
that
could
have
a
more
devastating
impact.
now,
although
the
aranda
decision
in
the
california
courts
is
merely
a
policy
decision
by
the
court
i
feel
that
it
hits
the
crux
of
what
we
got
here.
i
feel
that
we
have
a
situation
that
goes
far
beyond
the
yields
of
jackson
versus
denno
because
you
have
a
situation
where
the
jury
is
instructed
not
merely
to
consider
the
remarks
of
the
declarant
--
against
the
declarant,
and
not
against
the
other
individual.
we
have
a
situation
where
--
unlike
in
jackson
versus
denno
where
they
have
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
certain
evidence
is
admissible
and
then
either
reject
it
or
consider
it.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
they're
told
to
consider
it
and
not
consider
it
the
same
time.
they
are
told
to
go
in
there
and
deliberate
as
practical
men
about
whether
or
not
king
is
telling
the
truth
when
he
says
that
he
and
weaver
and
gilbert
planned
a
bank
robbery
and
that
it
was
committed
as
king
explained
that
it
happened
and
then
deciding
whether
or
not
that's
the
truth
for
purposes
of
king
and
then
turning
around
under
a
limiting
instruction
in
saying
even
though
we
have
decided
that
it's
true
insofar
as
king
is
concerned
we're
to
regard
it
as
untrue
insofar
as
gilbert
is
concerned.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
it
was.
it
was
decided
after
the
trial
of
this
case
and
before
the
appellate
decision
came
down.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
before
the
california
supreme
court
handed
down
its
opinion.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
and
the
consideration
of
aranda,
they
held
that
there
was
a
violation
and
relied
upon
a
lack
of
prejudice
to
affirm
the
conviction.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
by
reason
of
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
i
don't
think
yet
--
well,
i
should
say
that
this,
the
court
did
point
out
that
the
cautionary
instruction
was
given
but
the
heavy
reliance
as
i
read
the
case
is
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
eyewitness
testimony
by
others.
and
to
whom
--
with
california's
approach
which
is
i
think
contrary
to
the
fahy
approach
is
a
question
of
looking
at
the
case
in
saying
what
it
probably
have
resulted
in
any
different
decision.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
--
one
way,
it
could
be
viewed
that
way,
yes
sir.
mr.
luke
mckissack
absolutely.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i'm
not
willing
to
say
that
there
could
never
be
a
case
where
there
--
that
there
were
not
be
harmed
committed.
but
focusing
upon
the
nearest
analogous
area
that
we
have
which
are
confession
cases,
this
court
has
held
categorically
throughout
all
the
cases
that
have
been
presented,
that
where
you
have
a
confession
involved,
there's
no
point
really
inquiring
into
prejudice
because
you
can't
tell
how
much
damage
is
concerned.
now,
i'm
pointing
out
but
we
not
only
have
a
confession
here
which
mentions
gilbert
159
times,
describes
his
role
in
the
robbery,
points
out
that
he's
a
past
cop
killer,
and
he
threatens
to
kill
cops
in
the
future.
but
we
also
have
a
death
penalty
issue,
it
was
not
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
being
presented
to
the
jury
and
thrown
entirely
in
the
lap
of
the
jury
as
to
whether
this
man
should
live
or
die.
and
obviously
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
he
is
real
--
to
rehabilitate
him.
and
i
feel
therefore
that
any
instruction
that
was
given
and
a
traditional
one
was
that
you
cannot
consider
this
as
to
gilbert
would
be
completely
ineffectual.
and
i
think
that
it
used
the
language
of
a
past
justice
of
this
court,
indeed
it
was
a
peep
beyond
the
compass
of
ordinary
minds.
i
don't
think
that
the
jury
could
have
done
this.
now,
of
course
i
--
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
earlier
decision
that
we
have
here
in
delli
paoli
although
i
don't
think
this
distinction
need
be
made.
in
the
delli
paoli
situation,
there
was
no
showing
i
don't
think
of
an
illegally
introduced
statement.
it
was
a
question
of
being
legal
--
legally
introduced
inadmissible
against
the
man
that
was
introduced
against,
but
it
had
no
right
to
radiate
and
affect
the
other
defendant.
now,
on
this
case
so
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
statement
against
the
declarant
itself
was
inadmissible
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
only
basis
for
having
a
joint
trial
and
allowing
this
kind
of
a
statement
in
on
the
grounds
that
if
you're
going
to
grant
a
joint
trial
and
certainly
there
are
values
to
it.
and
if
you're
going
to
say
to
the
prosecution
you
can't
have
a
joint
trial
then
certainly
the
prosecution
would
like
to
get
in
admissions
or
confessions
against
the
party
that
made
them.
you
don't
even
have
that
justification
because
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
against
the
co-defendant
king
was
held
to
have
been
illegally
obtained.
and
if
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
was
held
to
be
constitutionally
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
think
that
it
was
your
honor.
if
your
honor
is
focusing
upon
a
cutoff
date
question,
is
that
what
your
honor
has
in
mind?
well,
this
maybe
a
manner
of
semantics
or
approach,
but
the
point
would
be
under
the
test
of
escobedo
and
all
cases
following
from
that
massiah
effect,
it
was
inadmissible.
the
question
is,
to
whether
escobedo
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
do
you
mean
as
to
the
custody
requirement
and
so
forth?
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well
no,
there's
a
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
they
do
not
--
no,
they
--
well,
in
the
sense
that
miranda
in
more
and
less
than
the
cutoff
question
talks
about
the
fact
that
because
courts
differed
on
the
interpretation
of
escobedo
as
to
whether
you
had
to
ask
for
a
counsel
or
whether
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
after
the
language
in
miranda,
i
would
say
that
is
certainly
a
violation
but
your
honor
could
--
your
honors
could
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
because
of
the
fact
that
the
custodial
stage
is
attached
and
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
at
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
the
point
that
i
would
be
trying
to
make
is
that
the
question
the
court
would
have
to
decide
on
this
issue
would
be
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
miranda
is
as
a
constitutional
ground
--
alright,
the
violation
is
there
but
nevertheless
under
the
johnson
case
we
would
not
apply
it
retroactively
for
the
policy
reason
stated.
but
nevertheless
the
court,
obviously
the
california
court
would
have
the
right
to
enlarge
or
device
its
own
retroactivity
rule.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
have
it
by
hearsay
yester
--
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
that
i
heard
that
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
have
not
had
accessed
to
the
opinion
but
this
--
what
i
understand
is
in
a
case
called
people
versus
rollins,
california
supreme
court
has
unless
i'm
wrong
applied
escobedo
retroactively
to
the
extent
that
it
would
apply
to
cases
pending
on
appeal.
now,
i
maybe
wrong
but
this
is
what
the
counsel
who
handled
the
case
told
me
yesterday
as
i
was
on
--
eb\n
route
to
the
airport.
mr.
luke
mckissack
pardon
me.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no
it
is
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
don't
want
to
make
that
a
full
point
of
contention
your
honor.
i
would
contend
it's
absolutely
irrelevant
that
this
court
should
not
consider
that
a
crucial
factor
but
i
was
merely
pointing
it
out
because
i
was
mindful
of
the
fact
that
in
the
fight
for
delli
paoli
decision,
that
that
factor
was
not
present.
and
that
in
the
analysis
of
gilbert
and
aranda,
this
differentiation
was
pointed
out
and
i
wanted
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
for
whatever
bearing
would
have.
i
don't
think
personally
that
you
have
any
bearing
because
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
gilbert's.
mr.
luke
mckissack
certainly
as
to
death
penalty
and
i
think
also
as
to
guilt
and
innocence.
that's
the
effect
of
--
that
it
could
be
either
be
viewed
as
a
fact
that
there
was
too
much
prejudice
and
therefore
it
could
be
reversed
under
a
due
process
standard
or
it
could
be
held
by
analogy
here
that
we
have
a
confession
in
the
case
and
by
resort
to
the
past
confession
cases,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
they're
usually
too
devastating
to
try
and
to
raise
and
that
would
also
call
for
reversal.
i
would
want
--
wish
to
call
this
to
the
court's
attention.
i
think
he's
looking
at
it
as
a
practical
matter
that
it
--
most
any
defense
counsel
would
--
they
concede
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
troublesome
problems
in
the
law
because
even
though
a
judge
and
there
might
be
a
distinction
here
because
i
should
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
california
has
not
used
aranda
across
the
board
in
court
trial
situations.
california
has
acknowledged
that
a
judge
for
example
might
be
able
to
work
two
hats
at
one
time,
a
judge
appreciates
exclusionary
rules.
he
recognizes
that
certain
kinds
of
cases
that
there
maybe
overwhelming
evidence
but
it's
illegally
obtained,
the
case
goes
out,
the
case
is
dismissed.
but
this
is
not
something
that's
usually
within
the
education
and
the
understanding
of
a
jury,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
last
instruction
to
the
jury
in
all
california
cases
ends
with
a
conclusion
that
their
sole
task
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
truth.
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
when
a
jury
goes
in
to
the
jury
room
this
is
what
they
have
in
mind
and
a
notion
of
an
exclusionary
rule
or
a
limiting
instruction
where
you
considered
only
against
some
and
not
as
against
others
embraces
a
concept
for
you
recognize
that
there
are
other
purposes
that
may
in
sense
collide
with
the
total
objective
of
total
ascertainment
of
the
truth.
it
may
cause
them
to
put
certain
things
out
of
their
mind.
and
i
cannot
imagine
a
more
drastic
situation
than
the
one
that
is
presented
here
and
that
is
where
they
just
can't
erase
it.
there's
just
no
way
in
the
world
to
unring
the
bell
and
this
of
course
is
what
we've
pointed
out.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
would
say
first
and
i
think
in
this
case
there
was
an
unfair
trial
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
recent
amendment
to
rule
14
of
the
federal
rules
and
the
decision
of
people
versus
aranda
be
in
a
sense
adopted
as
a
constitutional
mandate
because
i
think
that
it
gropes
with
the
problem
that
--
is
not
been
wrestled
with
sufficiently
and
provides
the
only
way
out
of
a
situation
here
where
otherwise
one
man
out
of
two
is
not
going
to
get
a
fair
trial.
in
connection
with
that,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
government
to
raise
the
fact
that
the
statements
were
going
to
be
introduced
so
that
the
defendant
would
be
on
position
to
come
back.
it's
the
government
and
not
the
defendant
that
decides
on
joint
trials.
the
defendant,
i'm
sure
mr.
gilbert
would've
been
quite
content
to
go
to
trial
by
himself
but
because
of
factors
and
important
factors
that
allow
joint
trials,
he
had
to
go
to
trial
with
a
co-defendant.
the
government
knew
this,
the
government
drew
up
the
indictment,
the
government
issued
the
information
against
both
of
them
jointly.
the
government
knew
what
the
their
evidence
was,
the
government
knew
whether
they
were
going
to
introduce
the
confession,
and
therefore
i
would
suggest
that
the
government
should
remind
counsel
of
this,
make
this
available
to
him
and
allow
counsel
the
opportunity
then
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
to
make
a
motion
for
severance.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it's
cited
in
the
reply
brief
which
i
presented
which
is
the
blue
one,
cited
on
page
3.
mr.
luke
mckissack
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
basically,
as
i
understand
it
it's
a
sort
of
a
congressional
adoption
of
the
policies
in
miranda
and
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
really
can't
have
a
fair
trial
under
these
circumstances.
the
trust
of
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
we
have
statements
that
the
government
says,
“alright,
we're
going
to
introduce
these
statements.
we
need
these
statements”.
the
next
question
for
the
judge
to
ask
is,
“alright,
can
we
delete
references
to
the
co-defendants,
so
satisfactorily
that
he
will
not
be
prejudiced”.
if
this
can
be
done
then
of
course
joint
trial
should
continue,
of
course
the
statement
should
be
admitted.
they
have
a
value.
if
this
cannot
be
done
then
the
motion
for
severance
should
be
granted
so
that
each
party
has
a
fair
trial.
and
this
i
think
is
an
essence
to
the
thrust
of
aranda,
and
aranda
relies
heavily
upon
what
i
think
is
implicit
in
the
reasoning
of
jackson
versus
denno
and
that
is
a
realistic
analysis
of
the
fair
trial
situation
in
this
kind
of
context
where
a
jury
is
asked
to
do
something
that
even
a
lawyer
would
find
difficult
or
a
judge
would
find
difficult.
there
are
no
further
questions
on
this
issue
i
think
i'll
turn
to
right
to
lineup.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel
to
lineup,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
that
i
am
attempting
here
to
emphasize
and
perhaps
to
draw
favoritism
towards
the
amendment
that
i
think
is
most
important.
i
am
attempting
to
put
this
in
a
sixth
amendment
context.
i
think
that
there
are
decisions
from
this
court
that
hold
amongst
other
things
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
not
limited
to
merely
being
an
adjunct
or
protector
of
the
fifth
amendment.
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
on
that
point.
obviously,
in
the
in
trial
phase,
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
limited
to
protecting
merely
the
fifth.
as
justice
friendly
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
--
in
a
dissent
in
one
of
the
companion
cases
to
gilbert,
obviously,
if
we
were
in
trial,
the
jury
was
selected,
defense
counsel
standing
there
and
it
is
suggested
that
the
defendant
adorned
himself
in
a
certain
way,
maybe
wear
a
baseball
cap
if
that's
what
the
robber
wore.
that
perhaps
you
could
have
them
do
this.
there
would
be
a
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
but
holding
there
was
no
violation,
you
can
have
him
do
this.
but
it
would
not
be
proper
to
tell
the
counsel
to
excuse
himself
from
the
room
because
the
sixth
amendment
would
allow
counsel
--
would
be
present,
observe
the
circumstances
under
which
the
test
was
performed,
make
appropriate
comment
to
the
jury,
make
his
objections
and
i
think
the
same
point
should
be
held
here.
i
think
that
once
you
have
judicial
proceedings
inaugurated
and
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
amongst
this
court
as
to
when
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
but
i
think
that
once
the
judicial
proceedings
have
inaugurate
--
have
been
inaugurated,
we've
had
an
arraignment,
we've
had
the
appointment
of
an
attorney,
the
probable
cause
necessary
to
reduce
suspects
down
to
one
so
that
he's
held
for
trial
has
already
been
passed
upon.
he's
been
arrested,
he's
been
indicted,
he's
been
arraigned
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
appointed
counsel
and
then
relieved
by
privately
obtained
counsel
the
appointed
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
counsel
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
right.
mr.
luke
mckissack
true.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
the
question
is
really
not
to
gone,
too
well
in
the
state
report.
the
opposition,
the
attorney
general
of
course
cites
the
federal
gilbert
case
which
runs
along
parallel
to
this
for
which
he
got
100
years
and
points
out
there
that
that
he
did
ask
for
counsel
and
he
was
denied
the
right
to
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
before
he
was
put
in
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
and
i
should
point
out
parenthetically
for
whatever
its
worth,
there
is
a
california
statute
which
requires
the
intersession
of
a
magistrate
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
prisoner
should
be
removed
from
the
jail
for
any
purpose
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
once
a
person
is
been
arrested,
he's
been
brought
in
and
the
judicial
machinery
has
come
into
operation
that
a
judge
should
at
least
be
potentially
available
to
rule
upon
any
question
is
to
how
the
defendant's
going
to
spend
his
time
or
for
what
use
he's
going
to
be
put.
now,
the
trust
of
the
opposition
briefs
both
the
government
and
the
state
of
california
is
to
try
to
limit
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
protector
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
so
their
argument
goes,
let's
see
if
there's
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
fifth
amendment
violation,
need
counsel.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
do
not
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
argument
is
much
clearer.
mr.
luke
mckissack
schmerber
certainly
has
a
lot
of
bearing
on
the
case.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
think
it's
distinguishable
however.
schmerber
is
--
your
honor
would
probably
know
better
than
anyone
else,
i
think
is
a
carefully
drawn
opinion
trying
to
deal
with
the
facts
before
it.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
--
no
judicial
proceedings
have
been
inaugurated.
we
had
an
arrest
nothing
further
no
complaint
to
the
da,
no
indictment
or
preliminary
hearing
or
anything
else
to
take
the
defendant
into
court.
we
have
a
very
reliable
test
involved,
we
have
a
doctor
there
taking
a
blood
test
and
the
simple
question
raised
as
i
read
the
decision
was,
what's
the
effect
of
the
defendant
saying,
“my
counsel
told
me
not
to
take
the
test”,
and
the
court
held,
well,
since
you
didn't
have
a
right
not
to
take
it,
what
harm
was
done
by
his
refusal
to
take
and
not
having
counsel
there.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that
is
the
only
distinction
i
would
make
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
small
one.
i
think
it
--
because
it
isn't
--
the
court
necessarily
its
--
itself
in
a
situation
where
it
must
decide
where
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
as
far
as
i
can
see.
all
of
these
questions
are
going
to
raise
sixth
amendment
questions.
“did
you
have
counsel
or
not?”
and
involved
--
just
not
--
just
a
narrow
issue
of
gilbert,
but
implicit
here
is
what
are
you
going
to
tie
the
right
to
counsel
to
him?
if
the
court
is
going
to
just
say,
“alright,
schmerber
interpreted
meaning
you
have
--
if
you
interpret
it
to
mean
that
you
only
need
the
sixth
amendment
protection
when
you
got
a
fifth
amendment
problem
in
a
pretrial
context,
i
think
it
leads
to
all
kinds
of
problems”,
because
unlike
to
taking
a
blood
which
is
either
straight
fifth
amendment
or
not
fifth
amendment
a
lineup
can
be
self-incriminatory
or
may
not
be.
for
example,
if
a
man
is
put
up
in
a
lineup.
and
in
this
case,
i
contend
some
self-incriminatory
question
were
asked,
a
man
is
put
in
the
line
up
and
he's
asked,
“did
he
commit
the
crime?”
and
he
says,
“yes,
or
no”
this
is
a
self-incriminatory
question.
and
in
this
point
here,
everyone
knew
in
the
community
you
have
100
people
in
an
auditorium
all
the
potential
eyewitnesses
are
thrown
together.
everyone
knew
that
gilbert
have
been
--
the
robber
have
been
arrested
in
philadelphia.
he
was
brought
back
here
for
identification
and
that
the
automobiles
that
were
being
driven
and
everything
and
that
he
was
alarmed
when
arrested.
he
was
asked
questions
in
the
lineup
and
this
is
in
the
state
record.
he's
asked
questions
in
the
lineup,
“were
you
armed
when
you
were
arrested?”
“where
were
you
arrested?”
and
“what
automobile
were
you
driving
or
what
automobile
do
you
own?”
now,
this
put
gilbert
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
in
the
dilemma.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no.
i
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i
don't
think
that
schmerber
goes
nearly
that
far.
at
least
i
would
hope
that
it
would.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
there
was
no
evidence
offered
as
to
statements.
so
the
issue
would
have
to
turn
upon
this,
the
bolstering
and
this
i
think
would
have
to
be
determined
upon
remand.
potential
eyewitnesses
are
brought
to
a
lineup.
the
question
is,
can
they
identify
mr.
gilbert.
in
the
course
of
this,
i
think
certain
self-incriminatory
events
occurred
which
i
think
undoubtedly
would
have
contributed
to
their
forming
their
opinion
that
this
was
undoubtedly
the
man.
now,
actually
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
course
the
witness
points
at
the
defendant
and
says,
“yes,
that's
the
man”.
but
i
think
in
effect
we're
going
to
have
a
question
of
an
exclusionary
rule
or
a
poison
fruit
question
which
will
ultimately
come
into
play.
but
clearly,
the
eyewitness
identification
for
the
people
dependent
to
some
extent,
how
much
extent
this
--
is
we
don't
know.
but
to
some
extent
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
absolutely,
that
--
that's
my
point
of
view.
i
--
in
fact
if
i
may
dwell
upon
that,
i
think
that's
the
key
that
the
right
to
counsel
must
be
attached
i
think
to
a
stage
of
the
judicial
proceedings,
could
be
an
escobedo
analysis
where
it
be
arrest,
you
take
massiah
and
make
it
perhaps
an
arraignment.
it
should
be
something
that's
traditional
--
perennial
that
repeats
itself
in
every
case
because
there
is
an
advantage
to
simplicity
because
you
don't
have
errors
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
an
excluding
evidence.
there's
an
advantage
to
making
it's
something
that
can
be
applied
perspectively
and
understood
by
people
who
must
apply
it.
these
are
necessarily
values.
i
would
suggest
that
tieing
it
to
an
fifth
amendment
question
which
is
a
very
hairy
question
and
schmerber
makes
this
clear.
there
are
all
kinds
of
situations
that
even
maybe
fifth
amendment
or
not.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
would
suggest
a
number
of
reasons.
he
could
for
example
if
he
was
--
the
client
was
going
to
the
lineup,
he
could
have
a
--
a
motion's
heard
before
a
judge
and
perhaps
ask
a
judge
that
certain
questions
not
be
asked.
he
can
informally
consult
with
the
prosecutor
and
say,
“well,
now
what
questions
are
you
going
to
ask
him?”
so
that
if
he
is
asking
incriminating
questions,
he
could
say
to
the
prosecutor,
“well,
that's
incriminating”
and
perhaps
he
would
voluntarily
withdraw
his
answer
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
if
not,
he
could
instruct
him
not
to
answer
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
would
say
that
under
decisions
of
this
court,
the
whole
case
and
so
forth
that
identification
in
the
role
without
adornment
so
to
speak
would
not
obtain
fifth
amendment
coverage,
so
i
don't
think
i
would
have
much
optimism
in
making
that
point.
mr.
luke
mckissack
oh,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
think
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
there
are
number
of
questions
that
could
be
asked
as
in
this
case
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
alright.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
he
can.
mr.
luke
mckissack
in
this
case
for
example
you
had
every
single
witness
thrown
into
the
same
auditorium
and
there
was
a
consensus
identification.
and
each
witness
was
asked
to
audibly
speak
out
when
they
recognized
the
man,
and
you
have
eight
or
ten
people
appearing
on
the
stage
and
they
stand
their
own
circle,
may
stand
this
way
and
then
you
see
them
from
the
front
view.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
for
observation
of
their
appearance
and
so
forth.
so
whether
this
was
the
man
you
saw.
alright,
now,
one
of
the
persons
says,
“alright,
its
number
4,
that's
the
man”.
well,
you've
got
all
of
these
other
persons
that
are
in
there
listening
to
it.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
there
are
any
number
of
reasons
that
would
motivate
a
person
then
to
be
sure
whether
they
weren't
before
joined
the
bandwagon
technique,
afraid
that
someone
else
is
more
perceptive
than
they
are,
variety
of
reasons
that
would
lead
a
person
to
join
with
the
same
conclusion
which
had
already
been
reached.
now,
it's
traditional
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
lawyer
could
say
to
the
prosecutor,
“i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
test
if
the
witnesses
were
excluded
which
is
a
requirement
under
california
law
and
in
fact
in
most
states,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
let
each
witness
come
in
one
at
a
time
and
draw
his
own
conclusions,
and
make
his
own
identification.”
now,
one
thing
that
occurred
to
me
en
route
to
washington
on
this
matter
is
that
--
i
know
the
government
is
emphasizing
that
counsel
is
more
or
less
a
rouge
in
a
sense
that
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
to
crap
the
case
for
the
prosecution.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
we
have
all
kinds
of
precedent
in
our
law,
if
we
go
outside
the
criminal
appeal,
for
informal
proceedings
which
don't
necessarily
leave
the
counsel
becoming
a
harmful
force.
for
example,
in
depositions,
in
civil
cases,
normally
you
just
have
two
counsels
present.
you're
entitled
to
make
objections.
normally
the
objections
are
made
and
people
are
permitted
to
answer
and
then
the
judge
will
later
make
rulings
on
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
necessarily
embrace
the
conclusion
that
because
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
are
there
without
the
presence
of
a
judge
or
the
mandatory
presence
of
a
judge
that
it's
necessary
going
to
leave
the
hostility
that
some
of
these
problems
can't
be
worked
out,
that
they
won't
agree
that
the
witnesses
should
be
segregated
and
so
forth.
plus
the
fact
you
do
have
the
added
boon
that
the
counsel
is
present,
he
observes
what's
going
on
and
he
is
in
a
sense
a
talking
witness
to
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
and
at
this
point
i
would
call
upon
the
strong
language
in
miranda
which
so
eloquently
suggests
that
having
counsel
present
is
a
valid
view
when
you're
going
to
extract
something.
now,
of
course,
the
taking
of
blood,
it
travels
through
--
let
say,
through
a
syringe
and
then
into
a
tube
and
i
don't
suppose
there's
anything
that
counsel
can
do
to
interrupt
this
journey.but
the
--
if
counsel
is
present,
you're
not
going
to
have
coerced
confessions
or
certainly
not
as
much
as
you
would
otherwise.
counsel,
i
think
can
present
--
prevent
this
and
if
counsel
is
present,
you're
not
as
likely
to
have
an
unfair
lineup
which
can
be
more
factually
and
more
accurately
exploited
at
trial
if
it
occurs.
and
if
counsel
just
has
to
ask
routine
questions
about
well,
where
were
people
and
so
forth,
he's
on
the
scene
and
i
suggest
that
counsel's
presence
is
a
positive
benefit.
and
there's
absolutely
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
are
we
talking
about
after
arrest
or
before
arrest?
mr.
luke
mckissack
after
arrest?
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
they
would
thrust
themselves
in
that
direction.
but
i
do
not
feel
that
this
court
would
be
required
to
say
that
because
the
same
arguments
would
apply
to
a
post
arrest
situation,
pre-indictment,
and
necessarily
we
must
decide
that
--
for
example,
if
i
may
refer
to
be
absent
justice
knowing
--
the
voting
on
massiah
and
escobedo,
i
don't
think
it
would
necessitate
a
conclusion
that
the
rule
should
not
be
applied
in
this
particular
case.
because
as
i
suggest
in
my
brief,
really
all
they
(inaudible)
by
the
government,
suggesting
that,
“well,
why
don't
you
have
counsel
on
the
scene
at
the
time
the
defendants
picked
up
as
a
suspect
or
where
his
fingerprinted
here
and
then
so
forth?”
these
are
not,
as
i
see
it,
pointing
out
positive
evils.
these
only
points
out
the
fact
that
our
judicial
system
as
is
developed
with
the
manpower
available
and
under
all
the
circumstances,
we
haven't
found
it
either
beneficial
or
necessary
to
supply
counsel
of
that
particular
stage.
i'm
not
of
all
convinced
that
it
wouldn't
be
desirable
in
an
ideal
situation
in
a
future
situation
that
to
have
both
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
present
perhaps
even
a
magistrate
ideally,
when
ballistics
test
are
made,
when
finger
print
tests
are
made
and
so
forth.
i'm
not
arguing
for
that
proposition
by
--
i
wish
to
point
out
that
i
think
the
fallacy
committed
by
the
opposition
here
is
to
try
to
carry
our
argument
to
such
an
extreme
by
labeling
these
occurrences
as
things
that
should
not
happen.
and
therefore
concluded
there's
no
real
difference
because
it's
still
the
same
process,
such
a
lineup
no
matter
when
it
occurs
and
therefore
there
shouldn't
be
counsel
in
this
case.
i
think
that
they
don't
point
out
that
counsel
shouldn't
be
present
in
the
other
cases
it's
just
that
we
haven't
found
it
necessary
to
attach
counsel
at
that
point.
a
consequence
in
this
particular
case
of
saying
if
we
were
to
assume
the
opposite
--
suppose
we
assumed
that
counsel
should
not
be
present
at
a
lineup,
then
i
think
there's
a
great,
great
requirement
here
as
to
what
--
what
are
the
limitations
of
the
right
to
counsel
or
when
should
he
be
present.
we
had
the
man
arraigned,
probable
cause
has
been
found,
he's
gone
through
an
indictment
or
preliminary
hearing,
the
next
thing
that
is
necessary
is
to
stand
trial.
now
does
this
mean
that
the
defendant
then
is
in
a
sense
--
can
be
conscript
--
conscripted
at
any
moment
by
the
police
out
to
take
various
test
and
without
consultation
of
counsel
and
many
of
these
tests
may
or
may
not
involve
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
bring
in
to
play.
since
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
not
quite,
but
i
--
the
first
part
of
your
statement
i
do
agree
with
it.
i
am
suggesting
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
suggesting
the
first
part
of
your
statement.
a
categorical
rule
for
counsel,
a
lineup
is
a
right.
now,
i
would
agree
that
then
there's
a
separate
question
that
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
right,
what's
the
consequence?
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
right
to
counsel.
i
always
--
i
don't
think
this
court
should
lay
down
a
rule
that
we're
going
to
retroactively
determine
whether
counsel
should've
been
present
because
of
what
happened.
i
think
this
court
should
say
that
counsel
after
he's
been
arraigned,
has
a
--
it
should
--
has
a
right
to
be
present
or
his
presence
is
waived.
then
comes
the
question
which
your
honors
been
dwelling
upon
and
that
is
what's
the
effect
of
him
not
being
there?
and
if
i
were
to
address
myself
to
that,
the
court
would
have
i
think
a
choice
between
a
categorical
rule
which
would
be
to
say
if
it
were
an
in-trial
court
situation,
the
case
would
automatically
be
reversed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
the
situation
where
the
counsel
was
not
present
in
the
arraignment,
they
have
a
reversal
of
the
death
penalty
murder
case
and
i
point
out
that
in
hamilton
none
of
the
rights
which
are
pointed
out
as
making
it
a
critical
stage
of
the
alabama
arraignment
procedure,
none
of
these
rights
were
necessarily
constitutional
rights.
so
this
is
another
example
of
the
fact
that
counsel
in
that
case
was
not
there
just
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that's
true.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i
think
that
you
have
to
get
to
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no.
i
am
contending
obviously
all
throughout
the
categorical
rule
as
a
possibility
because
in
the
arguments
for
that
are
number
one,
this
is
a
simple
requirement.
now,
anybody
i
think
can
follow
it.
once
he's
been
arraigned,
he
can
have
a
counsel.
there
should
be
no
future
violations
of
the
law
in
this
field
under
the
vague
contours
of
due
process,
yes,
but
not
in
this
area.
so,
i
think
simplicity
can
require
a
more
rigid
rule.
now,
the
rule
that
i
would
advocate
if
the
court
doesn't
accept
it
is
the
one
that's
been
urged
in
dissenting
opinions
in
the
gilbert
federal
case
by
justice
browning
and
in
the
white
case
by
judge
bazelon
and
that
is
that
it's
a
question
of
the
--
a
taint,
to
what
extent
has
the
eyewitness
identification
been
bolstered
or
contaminated
by
what
occurred
at
the
lineup.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
adopted
that
view
it
would
require
a
remand
to
this
case.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
it
is
a
betts
and
brady
approach.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i
wouldn't
advocate
it
if
we
do.
in
other
words,
my
position
is
where
simplicity
can
be
exacted,
simplicity
should
be
required.
there's
no
reason
at
all
we
should
have
this
problem
ever
arise
if
we
hold
that
counsel
is
required
after
arraignment.
but
the
reason
for
betts
and
brady
approach,
i
think
that
betts
versus
brady's
approach
is
not
bad.
it
just
shouldn't
have
been
the
case
and
right
to
counsel
in
betts
versus
brady.
the
reason
why
the
court
might
hold
that
betts
versus
brady
is
applicable
here
is
that
you
might
hold
it
is
just
too
severe
to
say
that
because
there
was
a
denial
of
right
to
counsel,
that
you're
going
to
throw
out
the
case
because
all
these
witnesses
can't
testify.
and
if
the
court
test
feels
that's
too
severe,
then
i
think
we've
got
to
look
for
a
moderate
rule
in
between
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
don't
think
it's
too
severe
because
of
the
fact
that
it
can
be
applied
with
simplicity.
if
these
were
a
vague
test
and
it
could
not
be
adhered
to.
if
these
were
like
some
of
the
questions
of
search
and
seizure,
or
like
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
find
it
a
little
bit
too
severe,
frankly
put.
but
i
think
that
the
--
just
like
in
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
cases,
i
think
that
every
single
--
if
counsel
goes
--
if
a
defendant
goes
to
trial
and
he's
never
asked
if
he
wants
an
attorney
and
he
goes
through
it,
there's
no
way
where
i
think
it
should
be
reversed
and
there
should
never
be
an
inquiry
to
prejudice.
why
not,
because
he
may
not
have
been
prejudiced,
but
i
don't
think
the
rule
is
so
drastic.
i
think
he
can
be
complied
with.
and
this
is
a
thrust
of
my
whole
argument
in
this
case
where
i'm
trying
to
keep
the
sixth
amendment
clear
of
the
fifth,
because
if
you're
going
to
attach
the
sixth
to
the
fifth,
you've
got
to
make
a
retroactive
determination
of
whether
the
fifth
was
violated
before
he
decided,
whether
he
should've
had
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
which
must
--
a
decision
which
must
be
made
before
the
fifth
amendment
comes
into
play.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
avoid.
but
if
we
take
the
middle
rule,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
where
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
in
court
eyewitness
identification
was
substantially
and
i
realize
this
is
a
vague
term
affected
by
the
proceedings
at
the
lineup.
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
more
of
vague
test
than
--
we
have
to
say
a
poison
tree
--
a
fruit
language,
where
all
the
court
can
really
do
is
to
sort
of
put
a
verbal
standard
out
and
roughly
suggest
what
the
court
is
trying
to
suggest.
that
is
that
a
tainted
fruit
of
an
illegal
search
should
not
be
introduced.
but
recognizing
that
this
principle
can
go
too
far,
a
language
is
thrown
out
about
so
attenuated
as
to
dissipate
the
taint.
it's
impossible
to
pin
that
down
as
to
what
it
means
but
it
does
indicate
that
there
comes
a
point
where
you
can
go
too
far.
and
so
i
would
suggest
if
the
court
took
the
middle
position
that
the
case
should
be
remanded,
so
that
a
full
pledged
hearing
can
be
heard
on
exactly
what
happened
at
the
lineup
--
whether
self-incrimination
is
involved
and
so
forth.
but
the
prejudice
--
prejudicial
factors
that
came
into
play,
whether
the
witnesses'
opinion
as
to
--
whether
they
saw
gilbert
was
in
fact
fortified,
bolstered,
or
made
by
what
they
saw
at
the
lineup.
and
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
my
contention.
it's
not
the
answer
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
fifth,
but
let
it
stand
as
it
is
because
it's
a
simple
requirement
and
i
think
it's
an
important
one.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
think
then
in
that
case
the
testimony
should
be
excluded.
i
would
say
this
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
because
there
wasn't
counsel
present.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
--
then
i'm
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
there
should
be
no
reversal
because
it
would
then
be
a
question
of
whether
the
fifth
amendment
was
violated.
if
their
right
to
counsel
is
satisfied
by
having
counsel
present,
there's
nothing
in
the
world
wrong
with
the
witness
for
having
his
testimony
bolstered
or
affected
by
what
occurred
at
the
lineup
because
i
would
contend
that
a
lineup
just
by
itself
is
not
illegal
and
there's
nothing
to
taint
the
identification,
the
mere
fact
that
they
formed
their
opinion
there
as
far
as
i
can
see
it,
there's
nothing
illegal
in
that.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
if
by
that
particular
witness,
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
--
well,
if
it
was
--
it
was
premised
upon
--
no,
it
would
require
an
interrogation
into
what
actually
happened
at
the
lineup.
mr.
luke
mckissack
then
he
is
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
would
say
that
if
--
alright,
if
the
witness
answered,
“well,
i
saw
the
man
at
the
bank,
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
at
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
if
defense
counsel
taints
it,
then
i
think
that
it
should
go
out
and
i
can't
think
of
a
better
place
to
do
it
than
on
a
cross
and
probably
occurs
more
there
than
any
other
time.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
think
that
it
should
go
out
under
those
circumstances.
the
one
thing
i
would
encourage
--
well,
that
i
would
encourage
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
then
the
--
i
see
what
you
mean.
i
think
there
would
--
well,
one
problem
of
course
is
yes.
once
this
rule
is
announced,
it
then
becomes
forecast
for
all
judges
and
lawyers
to
know
about.
and
i
would
think
that
the
prosecution
would
be
mindful
of
the
law
as
well
as
anyone
else.
all
we
really
--
all
i'm
really
asking
for
you
is
--
yes
sir,
the
prosecution
--
they
have
the
defendant
list
away
without
checking
with
counsel
and
put
him
at
the
lineup,
the
penalty
that
it
would
have
to
be
paid
is
that
if
the
testimony
that
was
obtained
to
which
--
which
is
given
at
trial
were
shown
to
have
been
premised
upon
something
that
occurred
at
the
lineup
and
that
was
where
they
fortified
their
opinion
that
it
should
be
excluded.
but
i
don't
see
any
particular
(inaudible)
in
the
--
of
course,
i
would
be
asking
in
this
case
for
the
proposition
that
cases
that
decide
the
law
first
announced
it.
it
should
certainly
be
applied
retroactively
because
this
encourages
defendants
to
come
before
the
court
and
i
think
it's
largely
explanatory
for
the
development
in
the
--
in
this
particular
field
of
civil
liberties
in
the
last
15
years.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i'm
looking
at
right
to
counsel
in
terms
of
occurring
at
a
stage
and
not
the
process.
i
--
in
other
words,
i
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
after
indictment
looking
at
the
photograph.
mr.
luke
mckissack
alright,
my
answer
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
my
answer
to
that
is
this
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
although
it
makes
--
although
it
is
not
traditional
and
i
realized
that
the
court
would
probably
not
make
any
matter
of
constitutional
law.
there's
no
positive
harm
in
having
counsel
present
to
determine
whether
one
photograph
is
singled
out.
a
number
of
photographs
are
singled
out.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
would
go
that
far,
so
i
wouldn't
ask
the
court
to
go
that
far.
i
think
ideally
that
that
there's
a
lot
of
harm
that
can
be
done
in
doing
photographs,
not
as
much
as
a
lineup
because
there
defendants
being
interrogated
and
it
may
turn
out
when
we
look
at
it
with
hindsight
that
he
didn't
incriminate
himself.
what
he
said
was
just
say
voice
identification
or
he's
standing
there
with
a
hat
on.
but
that
can't
occur
with
photographs.
there
are
two
differences.
number
one,
the
defendant
doesn't
speak
so
what
he
says
can
incriminate
himself,
can
hurt
him
otherwise.
and
number
two,
i
think
when
you
got
control
of
the
defendant,
there
are
number
of
things
he
might
do
to
injure
his
case
without
the
presence
of
counsel
that
he
can't
do
and
he's
nothing
but
a
picture
on
a
page.
but
for
example,
in
gilbert's
case
as
a
--
one
of
the
witnesses
pointed
out
this
--
that
he
seemed
a
little
reluctant
to
speak,
or
he
was
very
soft
and
looks
like
he's
trying
to
avoid
the
question.
now
this
can
in
a
sense,
tend
to
be
self-incriminatory
because
he
feels
he's
got
something
to
hide
and
therefore
he
shows
nervous
etcetera.
so,
i
think
you
have
some
distinctions
but
i
think
the
argument
of
the
court
would
be
that
if
these
are
parallel,
that
is
you're
looking
at
someone
in
a
lineup,
you're
looking
at
someone
in
a
photo,
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
because
we
have
not
attached
the
right
to
counsel
when
a
photograph
is
being
examined,
we're
not
going
to
do
it
whether
there's
a
lineup
involved.
they
are
the
differences
i've
pointed
out
plus
the
fact
that
we
have
just
not
held
that
is
necessary
or
that
critical
that
a
defendant
counsel
be
present
when
a
photograph
is
taken.
and
i
would
again
refer
to
what
the
language
of
--
matching
of
cases
on
irrelevant
facts.
i
think
the
critical
thing
here
is
to
gear
the
sixth
amendment
to
a
phase
of
the
proceedings
and
not
direct
to
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
photographs,
a
lineup,
handwriting
exemplars,
blood
tests,
and
so
forth.
i
feel
that
that's
going
to
involved
--
you
need
a
prospective
analysis
and
that's
going
to
involve
a
lot
of
questions
and
those
--
those
categories
all
over
them
are
not
entities.
they
may
either
be
self-incriminatory,
they'll
be
harmful
for
other
reasons
and
they
aren't
necessarily
entities.
and
i
would
point
out
there
are
some
precedent
because
in
england,
the
solicitor
attends
lineups
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
showing
that
the
english
judicial
system
--
interrogation
is
broken
down,
and
we
have
it
on
--
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
a
similar
example.
and
as
i
say
in
the
state
of
california,
the
statute
was
violated
but
called
for
a
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
mr.
gilbert
should've
been
wished
away
for
any
purpose,
lineup,
or
otherwise.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
just
make
one
comment
on
the
right
to
lineup.
i
think
that
there
were
at
least
two
or
three
incriminating
comments
that
were
obtained.
when
he's
asked
where
he
was
arrested,
he's
in
a
dilemma.
if
he
answers
truthfully,
he
says,
“philadelphia”
the
witnesses
there
know
the
robber
was
arrested
in
philadelphia.
if
he
answers
falsely,
that
if
he
knows
the
smattering
of
law
or
even
from
common
sense,
he
may
assume
that
it
could
be
used
against
him
in
trial
which
we
would
call
impeachment.
he's
asked
what
kind
of
a
car
he
owns.
if
he
names
the
right
car,
he
names
the
car
of
the
robber.
he's
--
he
was
also
asked
whether
he
was
armed
at
the
time.
and
in
this
trial,
and
the
california
court
held
this
to
be
erroneously
admitted,
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
own
the
45
--
he
had
a
45
weapon
on
him
at
the
time
that
he
was
apprehended.
they
held
this
was
error
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
policeman
was
killed
by
a
45
weapon.
and
at
the
lineup,
one
of
the
questions
was
asked,
“were
you
armed?”
if
he
answers,
“yes”,
he
says,
“45
weapon”,
this
is
incriminatory,
besides,
it
makes
him
a
suicidal
menace.
and
in
addition,
the
fact
that
he's
apprehended
in
philadelphia
when
the
crime
occurs
in
california
suggest
to
the
witnesses,
the
perspective
witnesses,
that
this
is
(inaudible),
and
that's
also
harmful
to
him.
so,
i
feel
that
this
is
another
advantage
of
the
sixth
amendment.
counsel
might
have
been
able
to
consult
with
the
district
attorney
and
say,
“alright,
we'll
segregate
the
witnesses.
let
them
make
identifications
one
by
one”.
maybe
after
this
is
done,
if
there's
a
value
that
can
sense
his
identification,
they
could
all
be
grouped
into
the
same
room.
and
then
they
can
make
identification.
but
i
think
the
counsel
could
have
assured
that,
he
could
have
prevented
the
self-incriminatory
questions.
one
thing
i
do
seek
to
avoid
is
that
in
--
depending
upon
whether
it's
a
stovall
or
wade
case,
there
have
been
--
the
lower
court
has
criticized
the
position
i
have
taken
particularly,
people
speaking
against
the
position,
by
i
think
reducing
it
to
an
absurdity
and
making
them
take
the
position
they
don't
take,
like
what's
counsel
going
to
do,
tell
the
defendant
to
wear
a
mask?
i'm
not
urging
that.
but,
what's
he's
going
to
do?
just
tell
him
not
to
go
there
at
all?
our
position
is
not
bottomed
on
those
assumptions.
it's
bottomed
on
the
fact
that
predictability
is
a
value.
having
counsel
there,
we
may
clean
up
a
lot
of
these
problems
and
if
may
call
to
mind,
one
of
the
cases
i
heard
this
morning,
it's
like
a
san
francisco
or
washington
ordinance
case.
if
you
find
as
a
matter
of
empirical
fact
that
everyone
is
consenting
to
something
and
there's
no
real
problem,
then
--
you
know,
you
would
have
evaluate
it
in
terms
of
circumstances
you
actually
find
and
we
should
encourage
here
as
little
violations
of
law
and
fifth
amendment
problems
as
possible.
and
the
presence
of
counsel
i
think
would
point
towards
us
in.
probably
i
just
point
out
that
i
think
miranda
doesn't
subject
counsel
into
the
interrogation
process
because
they
realize
that
there's
a
value
in
having
there
and
the
same
argument
would
make
for
this
case.
mr.
luke
mckissack
now
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
am
i
depending
on
harmless
error?
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
your
honor.
i
--
perhaps
each
question
involved
here
would
have
to
evaluated
differently.
but
the
court
would
have
of
course
had
a
choice
as
to
what
kind
of
test
it
would
apply
in
the
lineup
situation.
if
they
were
in
counsel,
obviously,
ipso
facto
reversal
of
this
before
you
could
--
if
you
choose
a
fahy
like
test,
i
would
suggest
that
when
we're
talking
about
the
sixth
amendment
with
something
so
easily
to
comply
with
that
we
should
have
across
the
board
test.
if
not,
we're
talking
about
the
effect
of
the
error
and
the
choice
is
to
either
treat
this
case
as
i
say,
and
i
think
it
should
be
treated
as
the
case
that
makes
the
lawyer
enunciates
the
rule
as
a
value
and
not
inquiring
--
introduce
your
prejudice
to
support
this,
historically,
we've
never
done
that.
in
griffin
versus
california,
they
--
well,
it
could've
been
asked,
“alright,
suppose
there
was
comment,
now,
what's
the
effect
of
it?”
the
court
hasn't
done
it.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
value
to
not
doing
it
this
particular
case
but
the
court
could
at
the
same
time
suggest
that
obviously
maybe
there'd
be
a
de
minimis
rule
so
that
--
if
there's
a
tiniest
infraction
of
the
law,
a
case
shouldn't
be
reversed.
i
think
that
those
points
of
view
can
be
squared
quite
easily.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
handwriting
exemplar
argument,
on
the
sixth
amendment,
i
think
we
can
just
simply
state
this
is
the
lineup
question
except
for
the
fact
that
where
in
escobedo
situation
and
not
in
massiah.
and
the
question
would
be,
“what
is
the
difference
between
a
person
under
arrest
and
a
person
who
has
been
arraigned?”
and
i
think
that
this
is
been
fully
briefed
and
the
court
has
considered
this
and
that
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
there
is
a
difference
clearly
between
say
an
arraignment
situation
and
a
post
arrest
situation.
there,
we
know
there's
a
great
difference,
where
they're
searching
to
see
if
a
crime
is
committed
and
trying
to
find
out
who
committed
it,
a
lot
of
questions
can
be
asked
and
properly
so.scenes
can
be
surveyed,
pictures
can
be
taken,
a
lot
of
things
can
be
done.
once
he's
focused,
once
a
person
is
arrested,
once
there's
probable
cause,
then
we
get
into
an
area
where
perhaps
the
right
to
counsel
should
attach.
i
would
argue
that
the
right
to
counsel
should
attach.
but
i
would
--
at
the
same
time
maintain
that
if
it
doesn't
attach
at
the
time
that
defendant
has
been
arrested,
it
certainly
should
attach
the
time
that
he's
gone
before
a
--
there's
been
a
grand
jury
indictment,
he's
been
informed
against
--
an
informal
judicial
proceedings
have
begun.
and
i
would
point
out
on
the
fifth
amendment
involving
handwriting
exemplars,
that
--
there
has
been
a
suggestion
previously
about
lie
detectors,
perhaps
this
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
while
other
forms
of
evidence
aren't.
i
think
this
is
very
tricky
and
very
difficult
question.
i
think
the
handwriting
exemplar
could
be
viewed
either
way.
certainly,
it's
different
than
taking
the
blood
in
some
senses,
the
question
is,
“is
the
difference
does
or
not
to
a
distinction
or
the
other
way
around?”
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
would
think
its
simple
majority
at
least
to
the
persons
who
have
inherently
study
handwriting
would
analogize
it,
at
least
to
fingerprinting,
and
think
that
it
would
identify
a
person,
but
not
all
the
courts.
and
in
an
area
like
this,
i
think
it
would
commit
the
court
too
an
examination
of
the
scientific
data,
the
moment
of
time
to
decide
if
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
plus
the
fact
that
you
may
assume
that
even
if
it
was
scientific,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
is
not
self-incriminatory.
i
think
upon
probing
into
it
that
the
fifth
amendment
to
some
extent
just
rest
upon
this
rule
--
concerns
and
is
nonetheless
for
it.
i
think
that
there
are
some
facets
of
it
that
is
difficult
to
analytically
tie
down
to
some
particular
purpose.
it's
not
purely
a
question
of
how
scientific
a
test
is.
its
--
can
be
expressed
in
the
popular
jargon,
we
don't
cause
people
to
dig
their
own
graves
and
this
has
a
meaning
to
some
people.
and
in
fact
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
philosophical
literature
in
the
field
of
criminal
law,
the
english
philosopher
h.l.a.
hart
is
probably
dedicated
and
made
his
greatest
contribution
by
pointing
out
that
many
of
our
criminal
laws
are
not
--
many
of
our
criminal
laws
are
not
premised
entirely
upon
the
ideas
that
we
think,
they
are
like
deterrents.
for
example,
you've
got
a
question
of
insanity
or
drunkenness,
the
old
utilitarian
school
of
jeremy
bentham
which
say,
“give
him
a
steeper
penalty”,
and
the
analysis
shows
that
the
reason
we
treat
insane
people
lightly
is
not
because
an
across-the-board
penalty
wouldn't
be
a
better
deterrent
because
its
only
--
maybe
one
or
two,
he
would
feign
insanity
or
creep
within
the
category
he
might
be
deterred.
but
we
do
it
because
of
the
considerations
that
we
think
its
right.
it
just
seems
to
square
with
our
notions
or
our
values
at
a
given
moment
in
time.
the
same
distinction
between,
say
omissions
and
acts,
a
person
shoots
the
man
on
the
beach
that's
murder.
if
he
sees
the
man
drowning,
he
doesn't
rescue
him,
and
the
person
is
not
a
relative
or
friend,
it's
an
omission
to
act.
it
maybe
reprehensible
but
we
don't
classify
it
the
same
way.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
guttural
or
literal
premise
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
we
can't
fight
--
put
our
hands
on.
and
so,
it
just
doesn't
require
an
analysis
of
how
scientific
evidence
is.
in
handwriting,
the
defendant
is
required
to
actively
procure
evidence
against
himself.
he
has
to
create
evidence
that
didn't
otherwise
exist
and
even
though
as
i
would
concede,
these
factors
of
this
rule,
i
think
that
it
does
go
into
the
question
because
it
coincides
of
what
people
think
about
what
the
fifth
amendment
ought
to
be.
and
i
think
that's
fair.
mr.
luke
mckissack
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
at
the
termination
of
yesterday,
i
was
informed
--
i
asked
the
marshal
to
inform
me
when
ten
minutes
were
left
and
i
managed
to
go
one
minute
over
till
nine,
but
i've
concluded
my
opening
argument.
mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining,
i
wish
to
direct
my
attention
to
two
issues
and
two
issues
alone,
one
being
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
delli
paoli
controversy,
and
secondly
the
question
at
the
lineup.
but
first,
let
me
say
that
on
this
question
of
delli
paoli
or
jackson
versus
denno,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
we
have
the
same
jury
adjudicating
both
the
question
of
depth
and
the
question
of
the
merits,
that
is
guilt
or
innocence,
and
all
they
did
was
take
--
i
think
a
week
in
before
they
started
on
the
other
matter.
in
other
words,
when
the
verdict
came
in,
i
think
it
was
perhaps
a
day
or
so,
and
then
they
immediately
began
to
deliberate
it.
and
i
think
its
mere
folly
to
assume
that
after
weeks
and
weeks
and
weeks
of
trial
that
they're
suddenly
going
to
forget
all
the
evidence
they've
heard.
and
merely
because
king
did
not
testified
again
on
the
death
penalty
question
that
there
--
to
have
forgotten
what
they
have
previously
heard.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes
and
the
california
supreme
court
points
this
out
quite
well
in
its
opinion.
the
california
supreme
court
points
out
that
amongst
other
things,
that
it's
not
going
to
--
as
to
reverse
this
as
to
king,
because
it
has
in
mind
the
fact
that
his
testimony
in
court
is
not
nearly
so
damaging
as
his
testimony
out
of
court.
for
example,
the
statements
about
gilbert,
killing
a
cop
and
going
to
kill
more,
and
the
statements
about
gilbert
then
threatening
the
king
--
kill
king,
but
his
efforts
being
ineffectual,
none
of
this
was
in
the
testimony
of
king.
it
was
only
in
the
hearsay
recitations,
given
by
king
to
the
officer.
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
recitations
came
first.
then
king,
after
that
took
the
stand
in
the
california
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
as
to
defense
counsel,
i
--
as
i
remember,
defense
counsel
attempted
to
do
this.
i
know
the
point
was
made
in
the
state
briefs
that
one
of
the
things
he
could
not
do
is
to
go
into
this
prior
confession
and
therefore
he
held
that
--
he
felt
that
that
this
was
an
error
in
itself.
i
mean,
there's
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
since
that
king
took
the
stand,
yes.
but
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
wasn't
in
evidence
against
the
petitioner
and
i
can't
imagine
in
front
of
the
jury
how
defense
counsel
would
to
--
would
dare
to
ask
king
on
the
stand
questions
that
would
just
reiterate
that
which
the
jury
has
been
instructed
to
forget.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
deleterious
even
of
he
had
right
in
the
world
to
do
it.
i
can't
imagine
anyone
doing
it.
it
wouldn't
make
much
sense,
i
don't
think.
but,
the
death
penalty
question
in
california,
there's
no
reasonable
doubt
standard
even.
it's
thrown
entirely
in
the
lap
of
the
jury.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
now
what
factors
influenced
them
and
what
factors
didn't.
and
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest,
when
a
man's
life
is
at
stake,
that
one
of
the
most
crucial
questions
is
what
are
the
chances
that's
he's
going
to
repeat
this
kind
of
conduct,
how
confirmed
a
criminal
is
he,
are
there
any
hope
for
rehabilitation.
and
when
this
statement
had
came
in,
designating
him
as
a
cop
killer
by
his
own
admission,
and
saying
that
he's
going
to
kill
more,
and
the
jury
couldn't
forget
that
no
matter
how
clearly
they
were
told
to
disregard
it.
i
would
point
out
it
would
just
be
absolutely
impossible
for
the
jury
to
follow
the
instruction
under
those
circumstances.
furthermore,
as
to
that
particular
statement,
if
we
go
back
to
delli
paoli,
i
don't
see
what
the
admissibility
is,
in
other
words,
in
what
way
is
it
admissible
against
king
because
he's
--
recites
the
fact
that
gilbert
said
that
he'd
killed
one
policeman
and
he's
going
to
kill
someone
else.
i
suggest,
this
is
merely
the
backdoor
technique
that
by
use
of
the
--
what
would
ordinarily
be
admissions
against
king
of
bringing
in
something
which
doesn't
even
qualify
with
that
score
and
that
it
radiates
over
against
gilbert,
and
no
instruction
can
cure
it.
so
i
think
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
--
on
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
a
motion
for
mistrial,
but
i
could
be
mistaken.
there
was
no
motion
for
severance.
and
my
commentary
on
this
would
be
that
the
people
versus
aranda
rule
in
california
did
not
come
down
until
after
gilbert
had
been
tried.
and
the
--
that's
upon
other
opinions
by
this
court
and
other
courts
have
indicated
that
counsel
can't
be
expected
to
anticipate
the
law
--
changes
in
the
law.
and
i
would
point
out
that
--
if
this
court
does
adopt
an
aranda
like
rule,
that
the
government
should
be
charged
with
letting
the
opposition
know,
if
they
have
these
kind
of
statements
and
they're
going
to
introduce
them,
because
after
all,
it's
the
government
that
brings
the
joint
trial
rather
than
two
separate
trials
because
the
government
knows
this
facts
and
knows
whether
they
need
these
statements
and
whether
they
are
going
to
be
introduced.
defense
counsel
would
have
to
resort
merely
to
surmise.
so
i
feel
your
honor
that
that
--
there's
certainly
was
no
harmless
error
even
if
that
standard
be
applied.
mr.
luke
mckissack
absolutely
not.
on
the
question
of
the
lineup
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
no.
i
insinuated
that,
i
didn't
mean
to.
i
was
advocating
that
that
should
be
the
position
of
the
court
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
aranda
rule
says,
that
where
you
have
this
kind
of
a
situation
--
it
doesn't
really
talk
about
whose
duty
it
is
to
tell
who
and
what.
perhaps,
it's
implicit
that
the
defendant
wouldn't
then
make
a
motion
for
severance.
but
of
course,
it's
saying
to
counsel
in
future
cases,
you
can
make
a
motion
for
severance
and
here's
what
to
do.
counsel
should
make
a
motion
for
severance
if
you
have
these
kinds
of
statements.
and
then
the
prosecution
would
have
the
opportunity
of
offering
an
alternative
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
of
effective
deletions.
this
could
be
done
by
a
joint
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
that's
not
(inaudible).
as
a
matter
of
policy
in
california,
each
defendant
has
a
separate
arrest
report
and
the
--
in
some
places,
the
co-defense
counsel
might
know
what
the
other
person
has
said,
in
other
cases,
they
might
not.
on
the
issue
of
the
lineup,
i
just
wished
to
point
--
bring
a
point
to
the
court's
attention.
one
other
paragraph
from
the
federal
court
opinion,
its
right
after
the
one
that
mr.
justice
brennan
quoted
where
witnesses
from
all
four
robberies
were
assembled
in
the
audience,
after
each
prisoner
went
to
the
general
routine,
the
fbi
agent
in-charged
asked
if
the
witnesses
wished
to
see
any
of
the
prisoners
again.
the
witnesses
who
were
--
witnesses
were
instructed
to
call
out
the
numbers
of
any
prisoner
they
recognized
and
they
told
that
if
they
had
doubts,
this
was
the
time
to
see
the
prisoners
the
second
time
and
asked
them
to
repeat
phrases
used
in
their
respective
robberies.
the
witnesses
called
out
the
numbers
of
two
or
three
of
the
prisoners
including
appellant,
that's
gilbert,
many
of
them
calling
out
appellant's
number.
the
prisoner
does
select
and
were
asked
by
various
witnesses
to
give
--
to
repeat
given
phrases,
walk
in
a
particular
way,
try
on
particular
articles
of
clothing.
the
appellant
was
asked
to
speak
loudly,
to
walk
rapidly
and
slowly
while
repeating
certain
phrases,
and
to
speak
more
loudly
which
one
witness
testified
appellant
refused
to
do
and
to
put
on
a
hat
which
of
two
of
the
witnesses
testified,
at
first
they
refused
to
do.
the
witnesses
talked
amongst
themselves
as
the
lineup
progressed.
now
i
think
this
bears
on
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
why
counsel
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
browning
recounting
the
facts
as
they
occurred
at
this
lineup
as
if
--
upon
the
appellate
--
from
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
there
were
a
lot
of
banks
robbed.
so
the
federal
courts
sees
--
don't
have
the
bank
robbery,
but
we
had
basically
the
same
evidence
on
the
same
lineup
and
the
same
witnesses
involved.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
an
interesting
point
because
you
have
a
state
trial
for
one
bank
robbery
for
which
the
other
is
really
admissible.
the
same
witnesses
that
are
going
to
testify
on
that
alone
are
in
the
same
chamber
and
not
segregated
from
other
witnesses
when
they
hear
questions
about
numerous
bank
robberies.
and
they
just
call
out
numbers
and
then
the
avalanche
continues.
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
gives
repeated
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
counsel
should
be
present
in
these
kinds
of
predicaments
mainly
because
its
unforeseeable
what
can
happen.
i
think
the
destruction
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
is
this
simple
and
that
is
if
self-incriminatory
situations
can
conceivably
arise
and
here
they
have
arise.
then
we
should
appoint
counsels
so
that
we
can
protect
against
these
things.
otherwise
we
have
a
retroactive
determination
which
requires
exclusion
of
evidence
which
should
not
happen.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
undoubtedly
knows,
the
certiorari
was
granted
on
four
different
grounds
and
i
would
propose
to
merely
highlight
what
counsel
estimates
be
the
pivotal
concerns
in
each
one
of
these
contentions
which
we
have
brought
before
this
court
commencing
first
with
the
question
of
the
confession
by
co-defendant
in
whether
or
not
limiting
instructions
to
the
jury
would
be
sufficient
to
eliminate
any
potential
prejudice.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
was
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
i'm
almost
positive.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i'm
almost
positive
that
it
was
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
of
course
i
could
be
mistaken.
the
first
issue
within
be
the
question
of
a
confession
of
the
--
of
a
co-defendant
in
whether
or
not
it
could
be
limited
to
the
declarant
not
to
a
non-declarant
not
used
against
him.
then,
the
duo
counsel
in
fifth
amendment
questions
first,
the
lineup
issue
and
in
the
issue
of
handwriting
exemplars
and
if
time
permits,
i
would
then
like
to
reach
the
issue
of
search
and
seizure
and
the
comp
--
and
the
effects
of
a
violation
if
there
was
in
fact
a
violation
of
search
and
seizure
laws.
now,
first
directing
my
attention
to
the
question
of
the
confession
issue
and
as
used
against
the
co-defendant,
i
would
point
out
that
i
think
that
the
reason
--
array
of
judicial
decisions
and
the
court's
own
judicial
intuition
would
point
out
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
troublesome
spots
of
a
law.
if
we
were
to
single
out
any
particular
problem
where
limiting
instructions
are
demonstrably
insufficient,
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
the
area
where
you
have
a
joint
trial
with
two
defendants
and
in
this
case
both
on
trial
for
their
lives
and
we
have
a
confession,
a
complete
confession
by
one
which
it
implicates
the
other
man.
and
in
this
case
not
only
implicates
him
but
you
have
statements
made
which
are
brought
in
against
only
the
co-defendant
king
here
which
purports
to
say
that
gilbert
admitted
killing
a
police
officer
and
said,
before
he
was
finished,
he
was
going
to
kill
some
more.
further
statement
showing
that
gilbert
attempted
to
kill
his
co-defendant
after
the
completion
of
the
bank
robbery.
i
think
this
is
particularly
pertinent
if
we
view
this
as
it
is,
a
death
penalty
case
against
the
background
of
california
penal
code
statute
190.1
which
is
erroneously
printed
in
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
is
i
think
1900
or
9090
but
190.1
which
throws
the
death
penalty
versus
life
imprisonment
issue
in
california
completely
in
the
lap
of
the
jury
without
any
kind
of
criteria
whatsoever.
they
have
a
complete
freehand
to
consider
all
factors
and
mitigation,
all
factors
and
aggravation
and
then
arrive
upon
a
decision
with
no
reasonable
doubt
criteria
or
anything,
a
complete
decision,
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
man
should
live
or
die.
and
we
have
brought
before
the
jury
something
that
would
otherwise
be
inadmissible
if
it
were
not
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
joint
trial.
but
being
a
joint
trial,
the
jury
heard
the
same
jury
that
decided
the
guilt
of
this
man
and
had
to
adjudicate
or
had
to
decide
the
penalty
also
heard
the
statement
which
set
in
effect
that
this
man
had
killed
the
policeman
and
was
going
to
kill
more.
and
i
can't
imagine
anything
that
could
have
a
more
devastating
impact.
now,
although
the
aranda
decision
in
the
california
courts
is
merely
a
policy
decision
by
the
court
i
feel
that
it
hits
the
crux
of
what
we
got
here.
i
feel
that
we
have
a
situation
that
goes
far
beyond
the
yields
of
jackson
versus
denno
because
you
have
a
situation
where
the
jury
is
instructed
not
merely
to
consider
the
remarks
of
the
declarant
--
against
the
declarant,
and
not
against
the
other
individual.
we
have
a
situation
where
--
unlike
in
jackson
versus
denno
where
they
have
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
certain
evidence
is
admissible
and
then
either
reject
it
or
consider
it.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
they're
told
to
consider
it
and
not
consider
it
the
same
time.
they
are
told
to
go
in
there
and
deliberate
as
practical
men
about
whether
or
not
king
is
telling
the
truth
when
he
says
that
he
and
weaver
and
gilbert
planned
a
bank
robbery
and
that
it
was
committed
as
king
explained
that
it
happened
and
then
deciding
whether
or
not
that's
the
truth
for
purposes
of
king
and
then
turning
around
under
a
limiting
instruction
in
saying
even
though
we
have
decided
that
it's
true
insofar
as
king
is
concerned
we're
to
regard
it
as
untrue
insofar
as
gilbert
is
concerned.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
it
was.
it
was
decided
after
the
trial
of
this
case
and
before
the
appellate
decision
came
down.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
before
the
california
supreme
court
handed
down
its
opinion.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
and
the
consideration
of
aranda,
they
held
that
there
was
a
violation
and
relied
upon
a
lack
of
prejudice
to
affirm
the
conviction.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
by
reason
of
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
i
don't
think
yet
--
well,
i
should
say
that
this,
the
court
did
point
out
that
the
cautionary
instruction
was
given
but
the
heavy
reliance
as
i
read
the
case
is
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
eyewitness
testimony
by
others.
and
to
whom
--
with
california's
approach
which
is
i
think
contrary
to
the
fahy
approach
is
a
question
of
looking
at
the
case
in
saying
what
it
probably
have
resulted
in
any
different
decision.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
--
one
way,
it
could
be
viewed
that
way,
yes
sir.
mr.
luke
mckissack
absolutely.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i'm
not
willing
to
say
that
there
could
never
be
a
case
where
there
--
that
there
were
not
be
harmed
committed.
but
focusing
upon
the
nearest
analogous
area
that
we
have
which
are
confession
cases,
this
court
has
held
categorically
throughout
all
the
cases
that
have
been
presented,
that
where
you
have
a
confession
involved,
there's
no
point
really
inquiring
into
prejudice
because
you
can't
tell
how
much
damage
is
concerned.
now,
i'm
pointing
out
but
we
not
only
have
a
confession
here
which
mentions
gilbert
159
times,
describes
his
role
in
the
robbery,
points
out
that
he's
a
past
cop
killer,
and
he
threatens
to
kill
cops
in
the
future.
but
we
also
have
a
death
penalty
issue,
it
was
not
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
being
presented
to
the
jury
and
thrown
entirely
in
the
lap
of
the
jury
as
to
whether
this
man
should
live
or
die.
and
obviously
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
he
is
real
--
to
rehabilitate
him.
and
i
feel
therefore
that
any
instruction
that
was
given
and
a
traditional
one
was
that
you
cannot
consider
this
as
to
gilbert
would
be
completely
ineffectual.
and
i
think
that
it
used
the
language
of
a
past
justice
of
this
court,
indeed
it
was
a
peep
beyond
the
compass
of
ordinary
minds.
i
don't
think
that
the
jury
could
have
done
this.
now,
of
course
i
--
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
earlier
decision
that
we
have
here
in
delli
paoli
although
i
don't
think
this
distinction
need
be
made.
in
the
delli
paoli
situation,
there
was
no
showing
i
don't
think
of
an
illegally
introduced
statement.
it
was
a
question
of
being
legal
--
legally
introduced
inadmissible
against
the
man
that
was
introduced
against,
but
it
had
no
right
to
radiate
and
affect
the
other
defendant.
now,
on
this
case
so
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
statement
against
the
declarant
itself
was
inadmissible
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
only
basis
for
having
a
joint
trial
and
allowing
this
kind
of
a
statement
in
on
the
grounds
that
if
you're
going
to
grant
a
joint
trial
and
certainly
there
are
values
to
it.
and
if
you're
going
to
say
to
the
prosecution
you
can't
have
a
joint
trial
then
certainly
the
prosecution
would
like
to
get
in
admissions
or
confessions
against
the
party
that
made
them.
you
don't
even
have
that
justification
because
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
against
the
co-defendant
king
was
held
to
have
been
illegally
obtained.
and
if
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
was
held
to
be
constitutionally
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
think
that
it
was
your
honor.
if
your
honor
is
focusing
upon
a
cutoff
date
question,
is
that
what
your
honor
has
in
mind?
well,
this
maybe
a
manner
of
semantics
or
approach,
but
the
point
would
be
under
the
test
of
escobedo
and
all
cases
following
from
that
massiah
effect,
it
was
inadmissible.
the
question
is,
to
whether
escobedo
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
do
you
mean
as
to
the
custody
requirement
and
so
forth?
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well
no,
there's
a
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
they
do
not
--
no,
they
--
well,
in
the
sense
that
miranda
in
more
and
less
than
the
cutoff
question
talks
about
the
fact
that
because
courts
differed
on
the
interpretation
of
escobedo
as
to
whether
you
had
to
ask
for
a
counsel
or
whether
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
after
the
language
in
miranda,
i
would
say
that
is
certainly
a
violation
but
your
honor
could
--
your
honors
could
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
because
of
the
fact
that
the
custodial
stage
is
attached
and
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
at
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
the
point
that
i
would
be
trying
to
make
is
that
the
question
the
court
would
have
to
decide
on
this
issue
would
be
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
miranda
is
as
a
constitutional
ground
--
alright,
the
violation
is
there
but
nevertheless
under
the
johnson
case
we
would
not
apply
it
retroactively
for
the
policy
reason
stated.
but
nevertheless
the
court,
obviously
the
california
court
would
have
the
right
to
enlarge
or
device
its
own
retroactivity
rule.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
have
it
by
hearsay
yester
--
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
that
i
heard
that
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
have
not
had
accessed
to
the
opinion
but
this
--
what
i
understand
is
in
a
case
called
people
versus
rollins,
california
supreme
court
has
unless
i'm
wrong
applied
escobedo
retroactively
to
the
extent
that
it
would
apply
to
cases
pending
on
appeal.
now,
i
maybe
wrong
but
this
is
what
the
counsel
who
handled
the
case
told
me
yesterday
as
i
was
on
--
eb\n
route
to
the
airport.
mr.
luke
mckissack
pardon
me.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no
it
is
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
don't
want
to
make
that
a
full
point
of
contention
your
honor.
i
would
contend
it's
absolutely
irrelevant
that
this
court
should
not
consider
that
a
crucial
factor
but
i
was
merely
pointing
it
out
because
i
was
mindful
of
the
fact
that
in
the
fight
for
delli
paoli
decision,
that
that
factor
was
not
present.
and
that
in
the
analysis
of
gilbert
and
aranda,
this
differentiation
was
pointed
out
and
i
wanted
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
for
whatever
bearing
would
have.
i
don't
think
personally
that
you
have
any
bearing
because
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
gilbert's.
mr.
luke
mckissack
certainly
as
to
death
penalty
and
i
think
also
as
to
guilt
and
innocence.
that's
the
effect
of
--
that
it
could
be
either
be
viewed
as
a
fact
that
there
was
too
much
prejudice
and
therefore
it
could
be
reversed
under
a
due
process
standard
or
it
could
be
held
by
analogy
here
that
we
have
a
confession
in
the
case
and
by
resort
to
the
past
confession
cases,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
they're
usually
too
devastating
to
try
and
to
raise
and
that
would
also
call
for
reversal.
i
would
want
--
wish
to
call
this
to
the
court's
attention.
i
think
he's
looking
at
it
as
a
practical
matter
that
it
--
most
any
defense
counsel
would
--
they
concede
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
troublesome
problems
in
the
law
because
even
though
a
judge
and
there
might
be
a
distinction
here
because
i
should
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
california
has
not
used
aranda
across
the
board
in
court
trial
situations.
california
has
acknowledged
that
a
judge
for
example
might
be
able
to
work
two
hats
at
one
time,
a
judge
appreciates
exclusionary
rules.
he
recognizes
that
certain
kinds
of
cases
that
there
maybe
overwhelming
evidence
but
it's
illegally
obtained,
the
case
goes
out,
the
case
is
dismissed.
but
this
is
not
something
that's
usually
within
the
education
and
the
understanding
of
a
jury,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
last
instruction
to
the
jury
in
all
california
cases
ends
with
a
conclusion
that
their
sole
task
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
truth.
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
when
a
jury
goes
in
to
the
jury
room
this
is
what
they
have
in
mind
and
a
notion
of
an
exclusionary
rule
or
a
limiting
instruction
where
you
considered
only
against
some
and
not
as
against
others
embraces
a
concept
for
you
recognize
that
there
are
other
purposes
that
may
in
sense
collide
with
the
total
objective
of
total
ascertainment
of
the
truth.
it
may
cause
them
to
put
certain
things
out
of
their
mind.
and
i
cannot
imagine
a
more
drastic
situation
than
the
one
that
is
presented
here
and
that
is
where
they
just
can't
erase
it.
there's
just
no
way
in
the
world
to
unring
the
bell
and
this
of
course
is
what
we've
pointed
out.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
would
say
first
and
i
think
in
this
case
there
was
an
unfair
trial
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
recent
amendment
to
rule
14
of
the
federal
rules
and
the
decision
of
people
versus
aranda
be
in
a
sense
adopted
as
a
constitutional
mandate
because
i
think
that
it
gropes
with
the
problem
that
--
is
not
been
wrestled
with
sufficiently
and
provides
the
only
way
out
of
a
situation
here
where
otherwise
one
man
out
of
two
is
not
going
to
get
a
fair
trial.
in
connection
with
that,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
government
to
raise
the
fact
that
the
statements
were
going
to
be
introduced
so
that
the
defendant
would
be
on
position
to
come
back.
it's
the
government
and
not
the
defendant
that
decides
on
joint
trials.
the
defendant,
i'm
sure
mr.
gilbert
would've
been
quite
content
to
go
to
trial
by
himself
but
because
of
factors
and
important
factors
that
allow
joint
trials,
he
had
to
go
to
trial
with
a
co-defendant.
the
government
knew
this,
the
government
drew
up
the
indictment,
the
government
issued
the
information
against
both
of
them
jointly.
the
government
knew
what
the
their
evidence
was,
the
government
knew
whether
they
were
going
to
introduce
the
confession,
and
therefore
i
would
suggest
that
the
government
should
remind
counsel
of
this,
make
this
available
to
him
and
allow
counsel
the
opportunity
then
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
to
make
a
motion
for
severance.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it's
cited
in
the
reply
brief
which
i
presented
which
is
the
blue
one,
cited
on
page
3.
mr.
luke
mckissack
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
basically,
as
i
understand
it
it's
a
sort
of
a
congressional
adoption
of
the
policies
in
miranda
and
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
really
can't
have
a
fair
trial
under
these
circumstances.
the
trust
of
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
we
have
statements
that
the
government
says,
“alright,
we're
going
to
introduce
these
statements.
we
need
these
statements”.
the
next
question
for
the
judge
to
ask
is,
“alright,
can
we
delete
references
to
the
co-defendants,
so
satisfactorily
that
he
will
not
be
prejudiced”.
if
this
can
be
done
then
of
course
joint
trial
should
continue,
of
course
the
statement
should
be
admitted.
they
have
a
value.
if
this
cannot
be
done
then
the
motion
for
severance
should
be
granted
so
that
each
party
has
a
fair
trial.
and
this
i
think
is
an
essence
to
the
thrust
of
aranda,
and
aranda
relies
heavily
upon
what
i
think
is
implicit
in
the
reasoning
of
jackson
versus
denno
and
that
is
a
realistic
analysis
of
the
fair
trial
situation
in
this
kind
of
context
where
a
jury
is
asked
to
do
something
that
even
a
lawyer
would
find
difficult
or
a
judge
would
find
difficult.
there
are
no
further
questions
on
this
issue
i
think
i'll
turn
to
right
to
lineup.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel
to
lineup,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
that
i
am
attempting
here
to
emphasize
and
perhaps
to
draw
favoritism
towards
the
amendment
that
i
think
is
most
important.
i
am
attempting
to
put
this
in
a
sixth
amendment
context.
i
think
that
there
are
decisions
from
this
court
that
hold
amongst
other
things
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
not
limited
to
merely
being
an
adjunct
or
protector
of
the
fifth
amendment.
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
on
that
point.
obviously,
in
the
in
trial
phase,
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
limited
to
protecting
merely
the
fifth.
as
justice
friendly
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
--
in
a
dissent
in
one
of
the
companion
cases
to
gilbert,
obviously,
if
we
were
in
trial,
the
jury
was
selected,
defense
counsel
standing
there
and
it
is
suggested
that
the
defendant
adorned
himself
in
a
certain
way,
maybe
wear
a
baseball
cap
if
that's
what
the
robber
wore.
that
perhaps
you
could
have
them
do
this.
there
would
be
a
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
but
holding
there
was
no
violation,
you
can
have
him
do
this.
but
it
would
not
be
proper
to
tell
the
counsel
to
excuse
himself
from
the
room
because
the
sixth
amendment
would
allow
counsel
--
would
be
present,
observe
the
circumstances
under
which
the
test
was
performed,
make
appropriate
comment
to
the
jury,
make
his
objections
and
i
think
the
same
point
should
be
held
here.
i
think
that
once
you
have
judicial
proceedings
inaugurated
and
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
amongst
this
court
as
to
when
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
but
i
think
that
once
the
judicial
proceedings
have
inaugurate
--
have
been
inaugurated,
we've
had
an
arraignment,
we've
had
the
appointment
of
an
attorney,
the
probable
cause
necessary
to
reduce
suspects
down
to
one
so
that
he's
held
for
trial
has
already
been
passed
upon.
he's
been
arrested,
he's
been
indicted,
he's
been
arraigned
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
appointed
counsel
and
then
relieved
by
privately
obtained
counsel
the
appointed
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
counsel
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
right.
mr.
luke
mckissack
true.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
the
question
is
really
not
to
gone,
too
well
in
the
state
report.
the
opposition,
the
attorney
general
of
course
cites
the
federal
gilbert
case
which
runs
along
parallel
to
this
for
which
he
got
100
years
and
points
out
there
that
that
he
did
ask
for
counsel
and
he
was
denied
the
right
to
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
before
he
was
put
in
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
and
i
should
point
out
parenthetically
for
whatever
its
worth,
there
is
a
california
statute
which
requires
the
intersession
of
a
magistrate
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
prisoner
should
be
removed
from
the
jail
for
any
purpose
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
once
a
person
is
been
arrested,
he's
been
brought
in
and
the
judicial
machinery
has
come
into
operation
that
a
judge
should
at
least
be
potentially
available
to
rule
upon
any
question
is
to
how
the
defendant's
going
to
spend
his
time
or
for
what
use
he's
going
to
be
put.
now,
the
trust
of
the
opposition
briefs
both
the
government
and
the
state
of
california
is
to
try
to
limit
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
protector
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
so
their
argument
goes,
let's
see
if
there's
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
fifth
amendment
violation,
need
counsel.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
do
not
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
argument
is
much
clearer.
mr.
luke
mckissack
schmerber
certainly
has
a
lot
of
bearing
on
the
case.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
think
it's
distinguishable
however.
schmerber
is
--
your
honor
would
probably
know
better
than
anyone
else,
i
think
is
a
carefully
drawn
opinion
trying
to
deal
with
the
facts
before
it.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
--
no
judicial
proceedings
have
been
inaugurated.
we
had
an
arrest
nothing
further
no
complaint
to
the
da,
no
indictment
or
preliminary
hearing
or
anything
else
to
take
the
defendant
into
court.
we
have
a
very
reliable
test
involved,
we
have
a
doctor
there
taking
a
blood
test
and
the
simple
question
raised
as
i
read
the
decision
was,
what's
the
effect
of
the
defendant
saying,
“my
counsel
told
me
not
to
take
the
test”,
and
the
court
held,
well,
since
you
didn't
have
a
right
not
to
take
it,
what
harm
was
done
by
his
refusal
to
take
and
not
having
counsel
there.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that
is
the
only
distinction
i
would
make
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
small
one.
i
think
it
--
because
it
isn't
--
the
court
necessarily
its
--
itself
in
a
situation
where
it
must
decide
where
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
as
far
as
i
can
see.
all
of
these
questions
are
going
to
raise
sixth
amendment
questions.
“did
you
have
counsel
or
not?”
and
involved
--
just
not
--
just
a
narrow
issue
of
gilbert,
but
implicit
here
is
what
are
you
going
to
tie
the
right
to
counsel
to
him?
if
the
court
is
going
to
just
say,
“alright,
schmerber
interpreted
meaning
you
have
--
if
you
interpret
it
to
mean
that
you
only
need
the
sixth
amendment
protection
when
you
got
a
fifth
amendment
problem
in
a
pretrial
context,
i
think
it
leads
to
all
kinds
of
problems”,
because
unlike
to
taking
a
blood
which
is
either
straight
fifth
amendment
or
not
fifth
amendment
a
lineup
can
be
self-incriminatory
or
may
not
be.
for
example,
if
a
man
is
put
up
in
a
lineup.
and
in
this
case,
i
contend
some
self-incriminatory
question
were
asked,
a
man
is
put
in
the
line
up
and
he's
asked,
“did
he
commit
the
crime?”
and
he
says,
“yes,
or
no”
this
is
a
self-incriminatory
question.
and
in
this
point
here,
everyone
knew
in
the
community
you
have
100
people
in
an
auditorium
all
the
potential
eyewitnesses
are
thrown
together.
everyone
knew
that
gilbert
have
been
--
the
robber
have
been
arrested
in
philadelphia.
he
was
brought
back
here
for
identification
and
that
the
automobiles
that
were
being
driven
and
everything
and
that
he
was
alarmed
when
arrested.
he
was
asked
questions
in
the
lineup
and
this
is
in
the
state
record.
he's
asked
questions
in
the
lineup,
“were
you
armed
when
you
were
arrested?”
“where
were
you
arrested?”
and
“what
automobile
were
you
driving
or
what
automobile
do
you
own?”
now,
this
put
gilbert
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
in
the
dilemma.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no.
i
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i
don't
think
that
schmerber
goes
nearly
that
far.
at
least
i
would
hope
that
it
would.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
there
was
no
evidence
offered
as
to
statements.
so
the
issue
would
have
to
turn
upon
this,
the
bolstering
and
this
i
think
would
have
to
be
determined
upon
remand.
potential
eyewitnesses
are
brought
to
a
lineup.
the
question
is,
can
they
identify
mr.
gilbert.
in
the
course
of
this,
i
think
certain
self-incriminatory
events
occurred
which
i
think
undoubtedly
would
have
contributed
to
their
forming
their
opinion
that
this
was
undoubtedly
the
man.
now,
actually
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
course
the
witness
points
at
the
defendant
and
says,
“yes,
that's
the
man”.
but
i
think
in
effect
we're
going
to
have
a
question
of
an
exclusionary
rule
or
a
poison
fruit
question
which
will
ultimately
come
into
play.
but
clearly,
the
eyewitness
identification
for
the
people
dependent
to
some
extent,
how
much
extent
this
--
is
we
don't
know.
but
to
some
extent
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
absolutely,
that
--
that's
my
point
of
view.
i
--
in
fact
if
i
may
dwell
upon
that,
i
think
that's
the
key
that
the
right
to
counsel
must
be
attached
i
think
to
a
stage
of
the
judicial
proceedings,
could
be
an
escobedo
analysis
where
it
be
arrest,
you
take
massiah
and
make
it
perhaps
an
arraignment.
it
should
be
something
that's
traditional
--
perennial
that
repeats
itself
in
every
case
because
there
is
an
advantage
to
simplicity
because
you
don't
have
errors
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
an
excluding
evidence.
there's
an
advantage
to
making
it's
something
that
can
be
applied
perspectively
and
understood
by
people
who
must
apply
it.
these
are
necessarily
values.
i
would
suggest
that
tieing
it
to
an
fifth
amendment
question
which
is
a
very
hairy
question
and
schmerber
makes
this
clear.
there
are
all
kinds
of
situations
that
even
maybe
fifth
amendment
or
not.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
would
suggest
a
number
of
reasons.
he
could
for
example
if
he
was
--
the
client
was
going
to
the
lineup,
he
could
have
a
--
a
motion's
heard
before
a
judge
and
perhaps
ask
a
judge
that
certain
questions
not
be
asked.
he
can
informally
consult
with
the
prosecutor
and
say,
“well,
now
what
questions
are
you
going
to
ask
him?”
so
that
if
he
is
asking
incriminating
questions,
he
could
say
to
the
prosecutor,
“well,
that's
incriminating”
and
perhaps
he
would
voluntarily
withdraw
his
answer
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
if
not,
he
could
instruct
him
not
to
answer
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
would
say
that
under
decisions
of
this
court,
the
whole
case
and
so
forth
that
identification
in
the
role
without
adornment
so
to
speak
would
not
obtain
fifth
amendment
coverage,
so
i
don't
think
i
would
have
much
optimism
in
making
that
point.
mr.
luke
mckissack
oh,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
think
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
there
are
number
of
questions
that
could
be
asked
as
in
this
case
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
alright.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
he
can.
mr.
luke
mckissack
in
this
case
for
example
you
had
every
single
witness
thrown
into
the
same
auditorium
and
there
was
a
consensus
identification.
and
each
witness
was
asked
to
audibly
speak
out
when
they
recognized
the
man,
and
you
have
eight
or
ten
people
appearing
on
the
stage
and
they
stand
their
own
circle,
may
stand
this
way
and
then
you
see
them
from
the
front
view.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
for
observation
of
their
appearance
and
so
forth.
so
whether
this
was
the
man
you
saw.
alright,
now,
one
of
the
persons
says,
“alright,
its
number
4,
that's
the
man”.
well,
you've
got
all
of
these
other
persons
that
are
in
there
listening
to
it.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
there
are
any
number
of
reasons
that
would
motivate
a
person
then
to
be
sure
whether
they
weren't
before
joined
the
bandwagon
technique,
afraid
that
someone
else
is
more
perceptive
than
they
are,
variety
of
reasons
that
would
lead
a
person
to
join
with
the
same
conclusion
which
had
already
been
reached.
now,
it's
traditional
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
lawyer
could
say
to
the
prosecutor,
“i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
test
if
the
witnesses
were
excluded
which
is
a
requirement
under
california
law
and
in
fact
in
most
states,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
let
each
witness
come
in
one
at
a
time
and
draw
his
own
conclusions,
and
make
his
own
identification.”
now,
one
thing
that
occurred
to
me
en
route
to
washington
on
this
matter
is
that
--
i
know
the
government
is
emphasizing
that
counsel
is
more
or
less
a
rouge
in
a
sense
that
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
to
crap
the
case
for
the
prosecution.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
we
have
all
kinds
of
precedent
in
our
law,
if
we
go
outside
the
criminal
appeal,
for
informal
proceedings
which
don't
necessarily
leave
the
counsel
becoming
a
harmful
force.
for
example,
in
depositions,
in
civil
cases,
normally
you
just
have
two
counsels
present.
you're
entitled
to
make
objections.
normally
the
objections
are
made
and
people
are
permitted
to
answer
and
then
the
judge
will
later
make
rulings
on
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
necessarily
embrace
the
conclusion
that
because
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
are
there
without
the
presence
of
a
judge
or
the
mandatory
presence
of
a
judge
that
it's
necessary
going
to
leave
the
hostility
that
some
of
these
problems
can't
be
worked
out,
that
they
won't
agree
that
the
witnesses
should
be
segregated
and
so
forth.
plus
the
fact
you
do
have
the
added
boon
that
the
counsel
is
present,
he
observes
what's
going
on
and
he
is
in
a
sense
a
talking
witness
to
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
and
at
this
point
i
would
call
upon
the
strong
language
in
miranda
which
so
eloquently
suggests
that
having
counsel
present
is
a
valid
view
when
you're
going
to
extract
something.
now,
of
course,
the
taking
of
blood,
it
travels
through
--
let
say,
through
a
syringe
and
then
into
a
tube
and
i
don't
suppose
there's
anything
that
counsel
can
do
to
interrupt
this
journey.but
the
--
if
counsel
is
present,
you're
not
going
to
have
coerced
confessions
or
certainly
not
as
much
as
you
would
otherwise.
counsel,
i
think
can
present
--
prevent
this
and
if
counsel
is
present,
you're
not
as
likely
to
have
an
unfair
lineup
which
can
be
more
factually
and
more
accurately
exploited
at
trial
if
it
occurs.
and
if
counsel
just
has
to
ask
routine
questions
about
well,
where
were
people
and
so
forth,
he's
on
the
scene
and
i
suggest
that
counsel's
presence
is
a
positive
benefit.
and
there's
absolutely
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
are
we
talking
about
after
arrest
or
before
arrest?
mr.
luke
mckissack
after
arrest?
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
they
would
thrust
themselves
in
that
direction.
but
i
do
not
feel
that
this
court
would
be
required
to
say
that
because
the
same
arguments
would
apply
to
a
post
arrest
situation,
pre-indictment,
and
necessarily
we
must
decide
that
--
for
example,
if
i
may
refer
to
be
absent
justice
knowing
--
the
voting
on
massiah
and
escobedo,
i
don't
think
it
would
necessitate
a
conclusion
that
the
rule
should
not
be
applied
in
this
particular
case.
because
as
i
suggest
in
my
brief,
really
all
they
(inaudible)
by
the
government,
suggesting
that,
“well,
why
don't
you
have
counsel
on
the
scene
at
the
time
the
defendants
picked
up
as
a
suspect
or
where
his
fingerprinted
here
and
then
so
forth?”
these
are
not,
as
i
see
it,
pointing
out
positive
evils.
these
only
points
out
the
fact
that
our
judicial
system
as
is
developed
with
the
manpower
available
and
under
all
the
circumstances,
we
haven't
found
it
either
beneficial
or
necessary
to
supply
counsel
of
that
particular
stage.
i'm
not
of
all
convinced
that
it
wouldn't
be
desirable
in
an
ideal
situation
in
a
future
situation
that
to
have
both
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
present
perhaps
even
a
magistrate
ideally,
when
ballistics
test
are
made,
when
finger
print
tests
are
made
and
so
forth.
i'm
not
arguing
for
that
proposition
by
--
i
wish
to
point
out
that
i
think
the
fallacy
committed
by
the
opposition
here
is
to
try
to
carry
our
argument
to
such
an
extreme
by
labeling
these
occurrences
as
things
that
should
not
happen.
and
therefore
concluded
there's
no
real
difference
because
it's
still
the
same
process,
such
a
lineup
no
matter
when
it
occurs
and
therefore
there
shouldn't
be
counsel
in
this
case.
i
think
that
they
don't
point
out
that
counsel
shouldn't
be
present
in
the
other
cases
it's
just
that
we
haven't
found
it
necessary
to
attach
counsel
at
that
point.
a
consequence
in
this
particular
case
of
saying
if
we
were
to
assume
the
opposite
--
suppose
we
assumed
that
counsel
should
not
be
present
at
a
lineup,
then
i
think
there's
a
great,
great
requirement
here
as
to
what
--
what
are
the
limitations
of
the
right
to
counsel
or
when
should
he
be
present.
we
had
the
man
arraigned,
probable
cause
has
been
found,
he's
gone
through
an
indictment
or
preliminary
hearing,
the
next
thing
that
is
necessary
is
to
stand
trial.
now
does
this
mean
that
the
defendant
then
is
in
a
sense
--
can
be
conscript
--
conscripted
at
any
moment
by
the
police
out
to
take
various
test
and
without
consultation
of
counsel
and
many
of
these
tests
may
or
may
not
involve
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
bring
in
to
play.
since
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
not
quite,
but
i
--
the
first
part
of
your
statement
i
do
agree
with
it.
i
am
suggesting
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
suggesting
the
first
part
of
your
statement.
a
categorical
rule
for
counsel,
a
lineup
is
a
right.
now,
i
would
agree
that
then
there's
a
separate
question
that
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
right,
what's
the
consequence?
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
right
to
counsel.
i
always
--
i
don't
think
this
court
should
lay
down
a
rule
that
we're
going
to
retroactively
determine
whether
counsel
should've
been
present
because
of
what
happened.
i
think
this
court
should
say
that
counsel
after
he's
been
arraigned,
has
a
--
it
should
--
has
a
right
to
be
present
or
his
presence
is
waived.
then
comes
the
question
which
your
honors
been
dwelling
upon
and
that
is
what's
the
effect
of
him
not
being
there?
and
if
i
were
to
address
myself
to
that,
the
court
would
have
i
think
a
choice
between
a
categorical
rule
which
would
be
to
say
if
it
were
an
in-trial
court
situation,
the
case
would
automatically
be
reversed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
the
situation
where
the
counsel
was
not
present
in
the
arraignment,
they
have
a
reversal
of
the
death
penalty
murder
case
and
i
point
out
that
in
hamilton
none
of
the
rights
which
are
pointed
out
as
making
it
a
critical
stage
of
the
alabama
arraignment
procedure,
none
of
these
rights
were
necessarily
constitutional
rights.
so
this
is
another
example
of
the
fact
that
counsel
in
that
case
was
not
there
just
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that's
true.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i
think
that
you
have
to
get
to
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no.
i
am
contending
obviously
all
throughout
the
categorical
rule
as
a
possibility
because
in
the
arguments
for
that
are
number
one,
this
is
a
simple
requirement.
now,
anybody
i
think
can
follow
it.
once
he's
been
arraigned,
he
can
have
a
counsel.
there
should
be
no
future
violations
of
the
law
in
this
field
under
the
vague
contours
of
due
process,
yes,
but
not
in
this
area.
so,
i
think
simplicity
can
require
a
more
rigid
rule.
now,
the
rule
that
i
would
advocate
if
the
court
doesn't
accept
it
is
the
one
that's
been
urged
in
dissenting
opinions
in
the
gilbert
federal
case
by
justice
browning
and
in
the
white
case
by
judge
bazelon
and
that
is
that
it's
a
question
of
the
--
a
taint,
to
what
extent
has
the
eyewitness
identification
been
bolstered
or
contaminated
by
what
occurred
at
the
lineup.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
adopted
that
view
it
would
require
a
remand
to
this
case.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
it
is
a
betts
and
brady
approach.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i
wouldn't
advocate
it
if
we
do.
in
other
words,
my
position
is
where
simplicity
can
be
exacted,
simplicity
should
be
required.
there's
no
reason
at
all
we
should
have
this
problem
ever
arise
if
we
hold
that
counsel
is
required
after
arraignment.
but
the
reason
for
betts
and
brady
approach,
i
think
that
betts
versus
brady's
approach
is
not
bad.
it
just
shouldn't
have
been
the
case
and
right
to
counsel
in
betts
versus
brady.
the
reason
why
the
court
might
hold
that
betts
versus
brady
is
applicable
here
is
that
you
might
hold
it
is
just
too
severe
to
say
that
because
there
was
a
denial
of
right
to
counsel,
that
you're
going
to
throw
out
the
case
because
all
these
witnesses
can't
testify.
and
if
the
court
test
feels
that's
too
severe,
then
i
think
we've
got
to
look
for
a
moderate
rule
in
between
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
don't
think
it's
too
severe
because
of
the
fact
that
it
can
be
applied
with
simplicity.
if
these
were
a
vague
test
and
it
could
not
be
adhered
to.
if
these
were
like
some
of
the
questions
of
search
and
seizure,
or
like
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
find
it
a
little
bit
too
severe,
frankly
put.
but
i
think
that
the
--
just
like
in
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
cases,
i
think
that
every
single
--
if
counsel
goes
--
if
a
defendant
goes
to
trial
and
he's
never
asked
if
he
wants
an
attorney
and
he
goes
through
it,
there's
no
way
where
i
think
it
should
be
reversed
and
there
should
never
be
an
inquiry
to
prejudice.
why
not,
because
he
may
not
have
been
prejudiced,
but
i
don't
think
the
rule
is
so
drastic.
i
think
he
can
be
complied
with.
and
this
is
a
thrust
of
my
whole
argument
in
this
case
where
i'm
trying
to
keep
the
sixth
amendment
clear
of
the
fifth,
because
if
you're
going
to
attach
the
sixth
to
the
fifth,
you've
got
to
make
a
retroactive
determination
of
whether
the
fifth
was
violated
before
he
decided,
whether
he
should've
had
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
which
must
--
a
decision
which
must
be
made
before
the
fifth
amendment
comes
into
play.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
avoid.
but
if
we
take
the
middle
rule,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
where
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
in
court
eyewitness
identification
was
substantially
and
i
realize
this
is
a
vague
term
affected
by
the
proceedings
at
the
lineup.
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
more
of
vague
test
than
--
we
have
to
say
a
poison
tree
--
a
fruit
language,
where
all
the
court
can
really
do
is
to
sort
of
put
a
verbal
standard
out
and
roughly
suggest
what
the
court
is
trying
to
suggest.
that
is
that
a
tainted
fruit
of
an
illegal
search
should
not
be
introduced.
but
recognizing
that
this
principle
can
go
too
far,
a
language
is
thrown
out
about
so
attenuated
as
to
dissipate
the
taint.
it's
impossible
to
pin
that
down
as
to
what
it
means
but
it
does
indicate
that
there
comes
a
point
where
you
can
go
too
far.
and
so
i
would
suggest
if
the
court
took
the
middle
position
that
the
case
should
be
remanded,
so
that
a
full
pledged
hearing
can
be
heard
on
exactly
what
happened
at
the
lineup
--
whether
self-incrimination
is
involved
and
so
forth.
but
the
prejudice
--
prejudicial
factors
that
came
into
play,
whether
the
witnesses'
opinion
as
to
--
whether
they
saw
gilbert
was
in
fact
fortified,
bolstered,
or
made
by
what
they
saw
at
the
lineup.
and
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
my
contention.
it's
not
the
answer
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
fifth,
but
let
it
stand
as
it
is
because
it's
a
simple
requirement
and
i
think
it's
an
important
one.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
think
then
in
that
case
the
testimony
should
be
excluded.
i
would
say
this
that
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
because
there
wasn't
counsel
present.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
--
then
i'm
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
there
should
be
no
reversal
because
it
would
then
be
a
question
of
whether
the
fifth
amendment
was
violated.
if
their
right
to
counsel
is
satisfied
by
having
counsel
present,
there's
nothing
in
the
world
wrong
with
the
witness
for
having
his
testimony
bolstered
or
affected
by
what
occurred
at
the
lineup
because
i
would
contend
that
a
lineup
just
by
itself
is
not
illegal
and
there's
nothing
to
taint
the
identification,
the
mere
fact
that
they
formed
their
opinion
there
as
far
as
i
can
see
it,
there's
nothing
illegal
in
that.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
if
by
that
particular
witness,
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
--
well,
if
it
was
--
it
was
premised
upon
--
no,
it
would
require
an
interrogation
into
what
actually
happened
at
the
lineup.
mr.
luke
mckissack
then
he
is
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
would
say
that
if
--
alright,
if
the
witness
answered,
“well,
i
saw
the
man
at
the
bank,
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
at
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
if
defense
counsel
taints
it,
then
i
think
that
it
should
go
out
and
i
can't
think
of
a
better
place
to
do
it
than
on
a
cross
and
probably
occurs
more
there
than
any
other
time.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
think
that
it
should
go
out
under
those
circumstances.
the
one
thing
i
would
encourage
--
well,
that
i
would
encourage
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
then
the
--
i
see
what
you
mean.
i
think
there
would
--
well,
one
problem
of
course
is
yes.
once
this
rule
is
announced,
it
then
becomes
forecast
for
all
judges
and
lawyers
to
know
about.
and
i
would
think
that
the
prosecution
would
be
mindful
of
the
law
as
well
as
anyone
else.
all
we
really
--
all
i'm
really
asking
for
you
is
--
yes
sir,
the
prosecution
--
they
have
the
defendant
list
away
without
checking
with
counsel
and
put
him
at
the
lineup,
the
penalty
that
it
would
have
to
be
paid
is
that
if
the
testimony
that
was
obtained
to
which
--
which
is
given
at
trial
were
shown
to
have
been
premised
upon
something
that
occurred
at
the
lineup
and
that
was
where
they
fortified
their
opinion
that
it
should
be
excluded.
but
i
don't
see
any
particular
(inaudible)
in
the
--
of
course,
i
would
be
asking
in
this
case
for
the
proposition
that
cases
that
decide
the
law
first
announced
it.
it
should
certainly
be
applied
retroactively
because
this
encourages
defendants
to
come
before
the
court
and
i
think
it's
largely
explanatory
for
the
development
in
the
--
in
this
particular
field
of
civil
liberties
in
the
last
15
years.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i'm
looking
at
right
to
counsel
in
terms
of
occurring
at
a
stage
and
not
the
process.
i
--
in
other
words,
i
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
after
indictment
looking
at
the
photograph.
mr.
luke
mckissack
alright,
my
answer
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
my
answer
to
that
is
this
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
although
it
makes
--
although
it
is
not
traditional
and
i
realized
that
the
court
would
probably
not
make
any
matter
of
constitutional
law.
there's
no
positive
harm
in
having
counsel
present
to
determine
whether
one
photograph
is
singled
out.
a
number
of
photographs
are
singled
out.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
would
go
that
far,
so
i
wouldn't
ask
the
court
to
go
that
far.
i
think
ideally
that
that
there's
a
lot
of
harm
that
can
be
done
in
doing
photographs,
not
as
much
as
a
lineup
because
there
defendants
being
interrogated
and
it
may
turn
out
when
we
look
at
it
with
hindsight
that
he
didn't
incriminate
himself.
what
he
said
was
just
say
voice
identification
or
he's
standing
there
with
a
hat
on.
but
that
can't
occur
with
photographs.
there
are
two
differences.
number
one,
the
defendant
doesn't
speak
so
what
he
says
can
incriminate
himself,
can
hurt
him
otherwise.
and
number
two,
i
think
when
you
got
control
of
the
defendant,
there
are
number
of
things
he
might
do
to
injure
his
case
without
the
presence
of
counsel
that
he
can't
do
and
he's
nothing
but
a
picture
on
a
page.
but
for
example,
in
gilbert's
case
as
a
--
one
of
the
witnesses
pointed
out
this
--
that
he
seemed
a
little
reluctant
to
speak,
or
he
was
very
soft
and
looks
like
he's
trying
to
avoid
the
question.
now
this
can
in
a
sense,
tend
to
be
self-incriminatory
because
he
feels
he's
got
something
to
hide
and
therefore
he
shows
nervous
etcetera.
so,
i
think
you
have
some
distinctions
but
i
think
the
argument
of
the
court
would
be
that
if
these
are
parallel,
that
is
you're
looking
at
someone
in
a
lineup,
you're
looking
at
someone
in
a
photo,
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
because
we
have
not
attached
the
right
to
counsel
when
a
photograph
is
being
examined,
we're
not
going
to
do
it
whether
there's
a
lineup
involved.
they
are
the
differences
i've
pointed
out
plus
the
fact
that
we
have
just
not
held
that
is
necessary
or
that
critical
that
a
defendant
counsel
be
present
when
a
photograph
is
taken.
and
i
would
again
refer
to
what
the
language
of
--
matching
of
cases
on
irrelevant
facts.
i
think
the
critical
thing
here
is
to
gear
the
sixth
amendment
to
a
phase
of
the
proceedings
and
not
direct
to
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
photographs,
a
lineup,
handwriting
exemplars,
blood
tests,
and
so
forth.
i
feel
that
that's
going
to
involved
--
you
need
a
prospective
analysis
and
that's
going
to
involve
a
lot
of
questions
and
those
--
those
categories
all
over
them
are
not
entities.
they
may
either
be
self-incriminatory,
they'll
be
harmful
for
other
reasons
and
they
aren't
necessarily
entities.
and
i
would
point
out
there
are
some
precedent
because
in
england,
the
solicitor
attends
lineups
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
showing
that
the
english
judicial
system
--
interrogation
is
broken
down,
and
we
have
it
on
--
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
a
similar
example.
and
as
i
say
in
the
state
of
california,
the
statute
was
violated
but
called
for
a
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
mr.
gilbert
should've
been
wished
away
for
any
purpose,
lineup,
or
otherwise.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
just
make
one
comment
on
the
right
to
lineup.
i
think
that
there
were
at
least
two
or
three
incriminating
comments
that
were
obtained.
when
he's
asked
where
he
was
arrested,
he's
in
a
dilemma.
if
he
answers
truthfully,
he
says,
“philadelphia”
the
witnesses
there
know
the
robber
was
arrested
in
philadelphia.
if
he
answers
falsely,
that
if
he
knows
the
smattering
of
law
or
even
from
common
sense,
he
may
assume
that
it
could
be
used
against
him
in
trial
which
we
would
call
impeachment.
he's
asked
what
kind
of
a
car
he
owns.
if
he
names
the
right
car,
he
names
the
car
of
the
robber.
he's
--
he
was
also
asked
whether
he
was
armed
at
the
time.
and
in
this
trial,
and
the
california
court
held
this
to
be
erroneously
admitted,
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
own
the
45
--
he
had
a
45
weapon
on
him
at
the
time
that
he
was
apprehended.
they
held
this
was
error
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
policeman
was
killed
by
a
45
weapon.
and
at
the
lineup,
one
of
the
questions
was
asked,
“were
you
armed?”
if
he
answers,
“yes”,
he
says,
“45
weapon”,
this
is
incriminatory,
besides,
it
makes
him
a
suicidal
menace.
and
in
addition,
the
fact
that
he's
apprehended
in
philadelphia
when
the
crime
occurs
in
california
suggest
to
the
witnesses,
the
perspective
witnesses,
that
this
is
(inaudible),
and
that's
also
harmful
to
him.
so,
i
feel
that
this
is
another
advantage
of
the
sixth
amendment.
counsel
might
have
been
able
to
consult
with
the
district
attorney
and
say,
“alright,
we'll
segregate
the
witnesses.
let
them
make
identifications
one
by
one”.
maybe
after
this
is
done,
if
there's
a
value
that
can
sense
his
identification,
they
could
all
be
grouped
into
the
same
room.
and
then
they
can
make
identification.
but
i
think
the
counsel
could
have
assured
that,
he
could
have
prevented
the
self-incriminatory
questions.
one
thing
i
do
seek
to
avoid
is
that
in
--
depending
upon
whether
it's
a
stovall
or
wade
case,
there
have
been
--
the
lower
court
has
criticized
the
position
i
have
taken
particularly,
people
speaking
against
the
position,
by
i
think
reducing
it
to
an
absurdity
and
making
them
take
the
position
they
don't
take,
like
what's
counsel
going
to
do,
tell
the
defendant
to
wear
a
mask?
i'm
not
urging
that.
but,
what's
he's
going
to
do?
just
tell
him
not
to
go
there
at
all?
our
position
is
not
bottomed
on
those
assumptions.
it's
bottomed
on
the
fact
that
predictability
is
a
value.
having
counsel
there,
we
may
clean
up
a
lot
of
these
problems
and
if
may
call
to
mind,
one
of
the
cases
i
heard
this
morning,
it's
like
a
san
francisco
or
washington
ordinance
case.
if
you
find
as
a
matter
of
empirical
fact
that
everyone
is
consenting
to
something
and
there's
no
real
problem,
then
--
you
know,
you
would
have
evaluate
it
in
terms
of
circumstances
you
actually
find
and
we
should
encourage
here
as
little
violations
of
law
and
fifth
amendment
problems
as
possible.
and
the
presence
of
counsel
i
think
would
point
towards
us
in.
probably
i
just
point
out
that
i
think
miranda
doesn't
subject
counsel
into
the
interrogation
process
because
they
realize
that
there's
a
value
in
having
there
and
the
same
argument
would
make
for
this
case.
mr.
luke
mckissack
now
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
am
i
depending
on
harmless
error?
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
your
honor.
i
--
perhaps
each
question
involved
here
would
have
to
evaluated
differently.
but
the
court
would
have
of
course
had
a
choice
as
to
what
kind
of
test
it
would
apply
in
the
lineup
situation.
if
they
were
in
counsel,
obviously,
ipso
facto
reversal
of
this
before
you
could
--
if
you
choose
a
fahy
like
test,
i
would
suggest
that
when
we're
talking
about
the
sixth
amendment
with
something
so
easily
to
comply
with
that
we
should
have
across
the
board
test.
if
not,
we're
talking
about
the
effect
of
the
error
and
the
choice
is
to
either
treat
this
case
as
i
say,
and
i
think
it
should
be
treated
as
the
case
that
makes
the
lawyer
enunciates
the
rule
as
a
value
and
not
inquiring
--
introduce
your
prejudice
to
support
this,
historically,
we've
never
done
that.
in
griffin
versus
california,
they
--
well,
it
could've
been
asked,
“alright,
suppose
there
was
comment,
now,
what's
the
effect
of
it?”
the
court
hasn't
done
it.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
value
to
not
doing
it
this
particular
case
but
the
court
could
at
the
same
time
suggest
that
obviously
maybe
there'd
be
a
de
minimis
rule
so
that
--
if
there's
a
tiniest
infraction
of
the
law,
a
case
shouldn't
be
reversed.
i
think
that
those
points
of
view
can
be
squared
quite
easily.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
handwriting
exemplar
argument,
on
the
sixth
amendment,
i
think
we
can
just
simply
state
this
is
the
lineup
question
except
for
the
fact
that
where
in
escobedo
situation
and
not
in
massiah.
and
the
question
would
be,
“what
is
the
difference
between
a
person
under
arrest
and
a
person
who
has
been
arraigned?”
and
i
think
that
this
is
been
fully
briefed
and
the
court
has
considered
this
and
that
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
there
is
a
difference
clearly
between
say
an
arraignment
situation
and
a
post
arrest
situation.
there,
we
know
there's
a
great
difference,
where
they're
searching
to
see
if
a
crime
is
committed
and
trying
to
find
out
who
committed
it,
a
lot
of
questions
can
be
asked
and
properly
so.scenes
can
be
surveyed,
pictures
can
be
taken,
a
lot
of
things
can
be
done.
once
he's
focused,
once
a
person
is
arrested,
once
there's
probable
cause,
then
we
get
into
an
area
where
perhaps
the
right
to
counsel
should
attach.
i
would
argue
that
the
right
to
counsel
should
attach.
but
i
would
--
at
the
same
time
maintain
that
if
it
doesn't
attach
at
the
time
that
defendant
has
been
arrested,
it
certainly
should
attach
the
time
that
he's
gone
before
a
--
there's
been
a
grand
jury
indictment,
he's
been
informed
against
--
an
informal
judicial
proceedings
have
begun.
and
i
would
point
out
on
the
fifth
amendment
involving
handwriting
exemplars,
that
--
there
has
been
a
suggestion
previously
about
lie
detectors,
perhaps
this
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
while
other
forms
of
evidence
aren't.
i
think
this
is
very
tricky
and
very
difficult
question.
i
think
the
handwriting
exemplar
could
be
viewed
either
way.
certainly,
it's
different
than
taking
the
blood
in
some
senses,
the
question
is,
“is
the
difference
does
or
not
to
a
distinction
or
the
other
way
around?”
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
would
think
its
simple
majority
at
least
to
the
persons
who
have
inherently
study
handwriting
would
analogize
it,
at
least
to
fingerprinting,
and
think
that
it
would
identify
a
person,
but
not
all
the
courts.
and
in
an
area
like
this,
i
think
it
would
commit
the
court
too
an
examination
of
the
scientific
data,
the
moment
of
time
to
decide
if
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
plus
the
fact
that
you
may
assume
that
even
if
it
was
scientific,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
is
not
self-incriminatory.
i
think
upon
probing
into
it
that
the
fifth
amendment
to
some
extent
just
rest
upon
this
rule
--
concerns
and
is
nonetheless
for
it.
i
think
that
there
are
some
facets
of
it
that
is
difficult
to
analytically
tie
down
to
some
particular
purpose.
it's
not
purely
a
question
of
how
scientific
a
test
is.
its
--
can
be
expressed
in
the
popular
jargon,
we
don't
cause
people
to
dig
their
own
graves
and
this
has
a
meaning
to
some
people.
and
in
fact
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
philosophical
literature
in
the
field
of
criminal
law,
the
english
philosopher
h.l.a.
hart
is
probably
dedicated
and
made
his
greatest
contribution
by
pointing
out
that
many
of
our
criminal
laws
are
not
--
many
of
our
criminal
laws
are
not
premised
entirely
upon
the
ideas
that
we
think,
they
are
like
deterrents.
for
example,
you've
got
a
question
of
insanity
or
drunkenness,
the
old
utilitarian
school
of
jeremy
bentham
which
say,
“give
him
a
steeper
penalty”,
and
the
analysis
shows
that
the
reason
we
treat
insane
people
lightly
is
not
because
an
across-the-board
penalty
wouldn't
be
a
better
deterrent
because
its
only
--
maybe
one
or
two,
he
would
feign
insanity
or
creep
within
the
category
he
might
be
deterred.
but
we
do
it
because
of
the
considerations
that
we
think
its
right.
it
just
seems
to
square
with
our
notions
or
our
values
at
a
given
moment
in
time.
the
same
distinction
between,
say
omissions
and
acts,
a
person
shoots
the
man
on
the
beach
that's
murder.
if
he
sees
the
man
drowning,
he
doesn't
rescue
him,
and
the
person
is
not
a
relative
or
friend,
it's
an
omission
to
act.
it
maybe
reprehensible
but
we
don't
classify
it
the
same
way.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
guttural
or
literal
premise
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
we
can't
fight
--
put
our
hands
on.
and
so,
it
just
doesn't
require
an
analysis
of
how
scientific
evidence
is.
in
handwriting,
the
defendant
is
required
to
actively
procure
evidence
against
himself.
he
has
to
create
evidence
that
didn't
otherwise
exist
and
even
though
as
i
would
concede,
these
factors
of
this
rule,
i
think
that
it
does
go
into
the
question
because
it
coincides
of
what
people
think
about
what
the
fifth
amendment
ought
to
be.
and
i
think
that's
fair.
mr.
luke
mckissack
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
at
the
termination
of
yesterday,
i
was
informed
--
i
asked
the
marshal
to
inform
me
when
ten
minutes
were
left
and
i
managed
to
go
one
minute
over
till
nine,
but
i've
concluded
my
opening
argument.
mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining,
i
wish
to
direct
my
attention
to
two
issues
and
two
issues
alone,
one
being
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
delli
paoli
controversy,
and
secondly
the
question
at
the
lineup.
but
first,
let
me
say
that
on
this
question
of
delli
paoli
or
jackson
versus
denno,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
we
have
the
same
jury
adjudicating
both
the
question
of
depth
and
the
question
of
the
merits,
that
is
guilt
or
innocence,
and
all
they
did
was
take
--
i
think
a
week
in
before
they
started
on
the
other
matter.
in
other
words,
when
the
verdict
came
in,
i
think
it
was
perhaps
a
day
or
so,
and
then
they
immediately
began
to
deliberate
it.
and
i
think
its
mere
folly
to
assume
that
after
weeks
and
weeks
and
weeks
of
trial
that
they're
suddenly
going
to
forget
all
the
evidence
they've
heard.
and
merely
because
king
did
not
testified
again
on
the
death
penalty
question
that
there
--
to
have
forgotten
what
they
have
previously
heard.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes
and
the
california
supreme
court
points
this
out
quite
well
in
its
opinion.
the
california
supreme
court
points
out
that
amongst
other
things,
that
it's
not
going
to
--
as
to
reverse
this
as
to
king,
because
it
has
in
mind
the
fact
that
his
testimony
in
court
is
not
nearly
so
damaging
as
his
testimony
out
of
court.
for
example,
the
statements
about
gilbert,
killing
a
cop
and
going
to
kill
more,
and
the
statements
about
gilbert
then
threatening
the
king
--
kill
king,
but
his
efforts
being
ineffectual,
none
of
this
was
in
the
testimony
of
king.
it
was
only
in
the
hearsay
recitations,
given
by
king
to
the
officer.
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
recitations
came
first.
then
king,
after
that
took
the
stand
in
the
california
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
as
to
defense
counsel,
i
--
as
i
remember,
defense
counsel
attempted
to
do
this.
i
know
the
point
was
made
in
the
state
briefs
that
one
of
the
things
he
could
not
do
is
to
go
into
this
prior
confession
and
therefore
he
held
that
--
he
felt
that
that
this
was
an
error
in
itself.
i
mean,
there's
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
since
that
king
took
the
stand,
yes.
but
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
wasn't
in
evidence
against
the
petitioner
and
i
can't
imagine
in
front
of
the
jury
how
defense
counsel
would
to
--
would
dare
to
ask
king
on
the
stand
questions
that
would
just
reiterate
that
which
the
jury
has
been
instructed
to
forget.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
deleterious
even
of
he
had
right
in
the
world
to
do
it.
i
can't
imagine
anyone
doing
it.
it
wouldn't
make
much
sense,
i
don't
think.
but,
the
death
penalty
question
in
california,
there's
no
reasonable
doubt
standard
even.
it's
thrown
entirely
in
the
lap
of
the
jury.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
now
what
factors
influenced
them
and
what
factors
didn't.
and
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest,
when
a
man's
life
is
at
stake,
that
one
of
the
most
crucial
questions
is
what
are
the
chances
that's
he's
going
to
repeat
this
kind
of
conduct,
how
confirmed
a
criminal
is
he,
are
there
any
hope
for
rehabilitation.
and
when
this
statement
had
came
in,
designating
him
as
a
cop
killer
by
his
own
admission,
and
saying
that
he's
going
to
kill
more,
and
the
jury
couldn't
forget
that
no
matter
how
clearly
they
were
told
to
disregard
it.
i
would
point
out
it
would
just
be
absolutely
impossible
for
the
jury
to
follow
the
instruction
under
those
circumstances.
furthermore,
as
to
that
particular
statement,
if
we
go
back
to
delli
paoli,
i
don't
see
what
the
admissibility
is,
in
other
words,
in
what
way
is
it
admissible
against
king
because
he's
--
recites
the
fact
that
gilbert
said
that
he'd
killed
one
policeman
and
he's
going
to
kill
someone
else.
i
suggest,
this
is
merely
the
backdoor
technique
that
by
use
of
the
--
what
would
ordinarily
be
admissions
against
king
of
bringing
in
something
which
doesn't
even
qualify
with
that
score
and
that
it
radiates
over
against
gilbert,
and
no
instruction
can
cure
it.
so
i
think
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
--
on
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
a
motion
for
mistrial,
but
i
could
be
mistaken.
there
was
no
motion
for
severance.
and
my
commentary
on
this
would
be
that
the
people
versus
aranda
rule
in
california
did
not
come
down
until
after
gilbert
had
been
tried.
and
the
--
that's
upon
other
opinions
by
this
court
and
other
courts
have
indicated
that
counsel
can't
be
expected
to
anticipate
the
law
--
changes
in
the
law.
and
i
would
point
out
that
--
if
this
court
does
adopt
an
aranda
like
rule,
that
the
government
should
be
charged
with
letting
the
opposition
know,
if
they
have
these
kind
of
statements
and
they're
going
to
introduce
them,
because
after
all,
it's
the
government
that
brings
the
joint
trial
rather
than
two
separate
trials
because
the
government
knows
this
facts
and
knows
whether
they
need
these
statements
and
whether
they
are
going
to
be
introduced.
defense
counsel
would
have
to
resort
merely
to
surmise.
so
i
feel
your
honor
that
that
--
there's
certainly
was
no
harmless
error
even
if
that
standard
be
applied.
mr.
luke
mckissack
absolutely
not.
on
the
question
of
the
lineup
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
no.
i
insinuated
that,
i
didn't
mean
to.
i
was
advocating
that
that
should
be
the
position
of
the
court
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
the
aranda
rule
says,
that
where
you
have
this
kind
of
a
situation
--
it
doesn't
really
talk
about
whose
duty
it
is
to
tell
who
and
what.
perhaps,
it's
implicit
that
the
defendant
wouldn't
then
make
a
motion
for
severance.
but
of
course,
it's
saying
to
counsel
in
future
cases,
you
can
make
a
motion
for
severance
and
here's
what
to
do.
counsel
should
make
a
motion
for
severance
if
you
have
these
kinds
of
statements.
and
then
the
prosecution
would
have
the
opportunity
of
offering
an
alternative
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
of
effective
deletions.
this
could
be
done
by
a
joint
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
that's
not
(inaudible).
as
a
matter
of
policy
in
california,
each
defendant
has
a
separate
arrest
report
and
the
--
in
some
places,
the
co-defense
counsel
might
know
what
the
other
person
has
said,
in
other
cases,
they
might
not.
on
the
issue
of
the
lineup,
i
just
wished
to
point
--
bring
a
point
to
the
court's
attention.
one
other
paragraph
from
the
federal
court
opinion,
its
right
after
the
one
that
mr.
justice
brennan
quoted
where
witnesses
from
all
four
robberies
were
assembled
in
the
audience,
after
each
prisoner
went
to
the
general
routine,
the
fbi
agent
in-charged
asked
if
the
witnesses
wished
to
see
any
of
the
prisoners
again.
the
witnesses
who
were
--
witnesses
were
instructed
to
call
out
the
numbers
of
any
prisoner
they
recognized
and
they
told
that
if
they
had
doubts,
this
was
the
time
to
see
the
prisoners
the
second
time
and
asked
them
to
repeat
phrases
used
in
their
respective
robberies.
the
witnesses
called
out
the
numbers
of
two
or
three
of
the
prisoners
including
appellant,
that's
gilbert,
many
of
them
calling
out
appellant's
number.
the
prisoner
does
select
and
were
asked
by
various
witnesses
to
give
--
to
repeat
given
phrases,
walk
in
a
particular
way,
try
on
particular
articles
of
clothing.
the
appellant
was
asked
to
speak
loudly,
to
walk
rapidly
and
slowly
while
repeating
certain
phrases,
and
to
speak
more
loudly
which
one
witness
testified
appellant
refused
to
do
and
to
put
on
a
hat
which
of
two
of
the
witnesses
testified,
at
first
they
refused
to
do.
the
witnesses
talked
amongst
themselves
as
the
lineup
progressed.
now
i
think
this
bears
on
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
--
why
counsel
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
browning
recounting
the
facts
as
they
occurred
at
this
lineup
as
if
--
upon
the
appellate
--
from
the
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
there
were
a
lot
of
banks
robbed.
so
the
federal
courts
sees
--
don't
have
the
bank
robbery,
but
we
had
basically
the
same
evidence
on
the
same
lineup
and
the
same
witnesses
involved.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
an
interesting
point
because
you
have
a
state
trial
for
one
bank
robbery
for
which
the
other
is
really
admissible.
the
same
witnesses
that
are
going
to
testify
on
that
alone
are
in
the
same
chamber
and
not
segregated
from
other
witnesses
when
they
hear
questions
about
numerous
bank
robberies.
and
they
just
call
out
numbers
and
then
the
avalanche
continues.
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
gives
repeated
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
counsel
should
be
present
in
these
kinds
of
predicaments
mainly
because
its
unforeseeable
what
can
happen.
i
think
the
destruction
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
is
this
simple
and
that
is
if
self-incriminatory
situations
can
conceivably
arise
and
here
they
have
arise.
then
we
should
appoint
counsels
so
that
we
can
protect
against
these
things.
otherwise
we
have
a
retroactive
determination
which
requires
exclusion
of
evidence
which
should
not
happen.
thank
you
sir.
