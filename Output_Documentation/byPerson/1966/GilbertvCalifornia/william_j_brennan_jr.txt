brennan,

mr.
mckissack,
aranda
was
decided
after
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see,
decide
--
aranda
was
decided
before
the
appellate
decision
and
this
case
came
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
consideration
of
aranda?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
by
reason
of
the
cautionary
instruction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
and
this
is
a
harmless
error
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
way
you're
presenting
it,
that
couldn't
possibly
be
harmless?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
overwhelming
additional
proof
of
guilt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
didn't
--
didn't
your
california
supreme
court
did
so
in
the
--
reconsidering
this
whole
business
now,
you're
not
going
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
it
had,
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say,
suppose
it
was
properly
admitted
against
weaver.
nevertheless,
the
cautionary
instructions
relied
to
159
references
as
to
gilbert,
the
things
that
weaver
said
gilbert
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
all
of
those
so
prejudiced,
whatever
it
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gilbert's
case
both
as
to
guilt
or
innocence,
but
in
any
event
as
to
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
rule
14
that
you
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
do
you
know
how
far
this
goes
mr.
mckissack?
do
you
say
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he's
been
indicted
and
been
arraigned,
then
the
police
ought
not
to
put
him
on
a
lineup
at
least
without
first
providing
him
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
a
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
if
he
had
counsel
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
appointed
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
the
police
acknowledged
he
did
have
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
police
brought
him
and
put
him
in
the
lineup
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
affording
him
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
ask
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
before
then
--
before
you
--
was
put
in
the
lineup
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
consult
his
lawyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
he
knew
he
have
a
lawyer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
he
was
refused.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
agree
there's
no
fifth
amendment
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
schmerber
have
any
bearing
instead
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
distinction
you
make
clear
is
that
in
this
instance
all
this
was
done
after
indictment,
after
arraignment
when
you
acknowledged
of
the
police
--
he
in
fact
had
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
lineup
itself
were
not
--
is
not
in
on
itself
involved
fifth
amendment
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
in
schmerber
suggests
that
asking
question
even
when
taking
a
blood
test
might
not
raise
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
a
footnote
there
that
leaves
that
open.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mckissack,
you
say
in
any
event
on
this
--
confine
the
sixth
amendment
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
stage
in
the
proceeding,
this
was
sufficiently
a
critical
stage
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
he
should
not
have
been
put
the
line
up
without
an
opportunity
first
to
talk
to
his
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
help
can
a
lawyer
give
him
beyond
saying
to
him,
answer
no
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
could
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
could
say
i
take
it,
the
lawyer
couldn't
--
if
all
that
the
police
said
they
want
to
do
is
simply
put
the
man
in
a
lineup,
the
lawyer
could
not
advised
him
not
to
stand
in
the
lineup,
could
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say.
all
actually,
i
suppose,
the
lawyer
could
say
to
him
is
keep
your
mouth
shut,
answer
no
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
questions.
the
lawyer
says
to
him,
“answer
no
questions”
and
he
says
it
to
the
district
attorney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
you
put
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fellow
on
lineup,
i've
told
them
to
answer
no
questions,
so
you
asking
him
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
he
do
any
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
for
voice
identification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
lawyer
would
do
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
wouldn't
all
these
arguments
equally
suggest
there
must
be
counsel
at
a
lineup
in
advance
of
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
sort
of
a
betts
and
brady
approach
to
the
right
of
counsel
at
the
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
you,
you're
going
to
all
through
that
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
it's
also
not
fair
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
seems,
mr.
mckissack,
i
gather
you
do
say
if
there's
no
counsel
present
and
then
on
your
middle
rule,
that
there
is
some
finding
of
taint
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
you
exclude
what?
all
evidence
of
identification
by
the
witness?
suppose
the
witness
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
--
in
other
words,
the
only
question
that
this
attorney
asked
the
witness
was,
“can
you
identify
the
man
you
saw
at
the
place
of
the
robbery?”
“yes”
“is
he
in
the
courtroom?”
“yes.”
“where
is
he?”
“over
there.”
you
wouldn't
allow
him
that
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i'm
assuming
now
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
he
didn't
answer
that.
the
only
answer
is
this,
“yes,
i
saw
him
at
the
bank."
"where
is
he?"
"sitting
over
there
alongside
counsel."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
the
first
question
is,
in
that
circumstance
the
judge
can
throw
it
out
and
he
has
to
declare
in
this
trial
and
prosecute,
he
couldn't
possibly
--
to
get
the
witness
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
right
that
most
of
authorities
have
had
considered
it,
had
believed
it
was
not
testimonial
and
therefore
not
a
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
know
exactly
what
each
was
asked
per
se?
was
there
a
question
further
how
was
it
done,
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
was
at
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
eight
testified
only
at
the
trial
on
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
the
three
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
what
the
three
who
testified
at
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
said
they
saw
or
heard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
mr.
sokolow,
suppose
a
question
were
put
each
one
in
the
lineup,
“where
you
guilty
of
this
crime
of
robbery
of
a
certain
savings
bank
which
occurred
in
such
and
such
day?”
would
you
be
taking
the
position
you
are
now
if
the
record
clearly
showed
that's
what
the
question
was
even
though
the
answer
was
not
offered
in
evidence
against
the
--
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
was
would
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
the
state
be
taking
the
same
position
that
there
was
no
fifth
amendment
issue
involved
if
that
had
been
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
problem
of
--
what
about
the
problem
of
fruits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
fruits,
leads.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
sokolow,
i
finally
get
--
have
this
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
is
very
confusing
business
trips,
so
many
different
ones
here.
so
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
and
this
opinion
here
of
judge
browning,
this
is
a
dissent
on
the
issue
of
lineup.
as
i
read
judge
duniway's
opinion,
the
holding
there
was
no
motion
had
been
made
to
suppress
and
so
forth.
it's
not
very
informative
about
what
happened
at
the
lineup.
now
judge
browning's
opinion
has
this
short
paragraph,
“approximately
13
men
including
appellant
appeared
on
stage,
the
prisoners
were
identified
by
number.
they
were
required
to
pose
the
center
of
the
stage
individually,
turn,
try
on
various
articles
of
clothing,
and
answered
questions
including
whether
they
owned
an
automobile,
where
they
were
arrested,
and
whether
when
arrested,
they
were
armed.
they
were
required
to
say
certain
phrases
used
during
the
robberies,
“freeze,
this
is
a
stickup.
this
is
a
holdup.
this
is
a
heist.
don't
anyone
move.
empty
your
cash
drawer.”
to
shout
these
phrases
and
repeat
them
in
a
quiet
voice
while
standing
still
and
while
walking
both
normally
and
at
a
rapid
pace”.
now,
does
that
describe
what
actually
happened
if
you
understand
it
at
the
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
was
--
i'm
--
is
the
testimony
in
the
state
case
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it's
the
same
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
the
--
if
the
initial
search
was
--
its
not
the
--
there
was
no
probable
cause
in
the
part
of
the
officers
to
know
that
stuff
was
there.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
until
they
got
into
the
apartment
they
sought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
if
the
original
entry
was
illegal,
the
seizure
is
not
--
the
better
because,
ultimately
you've
got
a
search
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
concede
--
can't
you
concede
that
sure,
he
is
compelled.
of
course
he's
compelled,
even
the
fifth
amendment
says
that,
but
the
issue
is
what
is
compelled
from
him
is
something
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
is
it
testimonial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
the
aranda
rule
is,
in
circumstances
like
this,
an
advance
of
trial,
the
prosecution
is
under
duty
to
advise
the
defense
of
the
existence
of
the
statement
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
--
no,
no,
no,
i'd
say
what
is
the
aranda
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but,
how
was
the
defense
learned
that
there
were
such
a
statement
as
king?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
as
i
understand
it
--
did
i
understand
mr.
james
to
say
that
this
federal
trial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
for
a
different
robbery
from
the
verdict
trial,
that
--
from
the
robbery
involving
a
murder
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
were
the
inquiries
at
the
lineup
all
directed
to
--
pinning
all
of
these
robberies
on
gilbert
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
on
somebody
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mckissack,
aranda
was
decided
after
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see,
decide
--
aranda
was
decided
before
the
appellate
decision
and
this
case
came
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
consideration
of
aranda?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
by
reason
of
the
cautionary
instruction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
and
this
is
a
harmless
error
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
way
you're
presenting
it,
that
couldn't
possibly
be
harmless?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
overwhelming
additional
proof
of
guilt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
didn't
--
didn't
your
california
supreme
court
did
so
in
the
--
reconsidering
this
whole
business
now,
you're
not
going
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
it
had,
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say,
suppose
it
was
properly
admitted
against
weaver.
nevertheless,
the
cautionary
instructions
relied
to
159
references
as
to
gilbert,
the
things
that
weaver
said
gilbert
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
all
of
those
so
prejudiced,
whatever
it
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gilbert's
case
both
as
to
guilt
or
innocence,
but
in
any
event
as
to
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
rule
14
that
you
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
do
you
know
how
far
this
goes
mr.
mckissack?
do
you
say
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he's
been
indicted
and
been
arraigned,
then
the
police
ought
not
to
put
him
on
a
lineup
at
least
without
first
providing
him
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
a
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
if
he
had
counsel
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
appointed
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
the
police
acknowledged
he
did
have
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
police
brought
him
and
put
him
in
the
lineup
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
affording
him
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
ask
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
before
then
--
before
you
--
was
put
in
the
lineup
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
consult
his
lawyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
he
knew
he
have
a
lawyer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
he
was
refused.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
agree
there's
no
fifth
amendment
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
schmerber
have
any
bearing
instead
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
distinction
you
make
clear
is
that
in
this
instance
all
this
was
done
after
indictment,
after
arraignment
when
you
acknowledged
of
the
police
--
he
in
fact
had
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
lineup
itself
were
not
--
is
not
in
on
itself
involved
fifth
amendment
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
in
schmerber
suggests
that
asking
question
even
when
taking
a
blood
test
might
not
raise
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
a
footnote
there
that
leaves
that
open.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mckissack,
you
say
in
any
event
on
this
--
confine
the
sixth
amendment
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
stage
in
the
proceeding,
this
was
sufficiently
a
critical
stage
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
he
should
not
have
been
put
the
line
up
without
an
opportunity
first
to
talk
to
his
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
help
can
a
lawyer
give
him
beyond
saying
to
him,
answer
no
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
could
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
could
say
i
take
it,
the
lawyer
couldn't
--
if
all
that
the
police
said
they
want
to
do
is
simply
put
the
man
in
a
lineup,
the
lawyer
could
not
advised
him
not
to
stand
in
the
lineup,
could
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say.
all
actually,
i
suppose,
the
lawyer
could
say
to
him
is
keep
your
mouth
shut,
answer
no
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
questions.
the
lawyer
says
to
him,
“answer
no
questions”
and
he
says
it
to
the
district
attorney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
you
put
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fellow
on
lineup,
i've
told
them
to
answer
no
questions,
so
you
asking
him
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
he
do
any
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
for
voice
identification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
lawyer
would
do
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
wouldn't
all
these
arguments
equally
suggest
there
must
be
counsel
at
a
lineup
in
advance
of
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
sort
of
a
betts
and
brady
approach
to
the
right
of
counsel
at
the
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
you,
you're
going
to
all
through
that
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
it's
also
not
fair
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
seems,
mr.
mckissack,
i
gather
you
do
say
if
there's
no
counsel
present
and
then
on
your
middle
rule,
that
there
is
some
finding
of
taint
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
you
exclude
what?
all
evidence
of
identification
by
the
witness?
suppose
the
witness
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
--
in
other
words,
the
only
question
that
this
attorney
asked
the
witness
was,
“can
you
identify
the
man
you
saw
at
the
place
of
the
robbery?”
“yes”
“is
he
in
the
courtroom?”
“yes.”
“where
is
he?”
“over
there.”
you
wouldn't
allow
him
that
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i'm
assuming
now
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
he
didn't
answer
that.
the
only
answer
is
this,
“yes,
i
saw
him
at
the
bank."
"where
is
he?"
"sitting
over
there
alongside
counsel."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
the
first
question
is,
in
that
circumstance
the
judge
can
throw
it
out
and
he
has
to
declare
in
this
trial
and
prosecute,
he
couldn't
possibly
--
to
get
the
witness
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
right
that
most
of
authorities
have
had
considered
it,
had
believed
it
was
not
testimonial
and
therefore
not
a
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
know
exactly
what
each
was
asked
per
se?
was
there
a
question
further
how
was
it
done,
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
was
at
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
eight
testified
only
at
the
trial
on
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
the
three
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
what
the
three
who
testified
at
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
said
they
saw
or
heard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
mr.
sokolow,
suppose
a
question
were
put
each
one
in
the
lineup,
“where
you
guilty
of
this
crime
of
robbery
of
a
certain
savings
bank
which
occurred
in
such
and
such
day?”
would
you
be
taking
the
position
you
are
now
if
the
record
clearly
showed
that's
what
the
question
was
even
though
the
answer
was
not
offered
in
evidence
against
the
--
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
was
would
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
the
state
be
taking
the
same
position
that
there
was
no
fifth
amendment
issue
involved
if
that
had
been
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
problem
of
--
what
about
the
problem
of
fruits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
fruits,
leads.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
sokolow,
i
finally
get
--
have
this
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
is
very
confusing
business
trips,
so
many
different
ones
here.
so
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
and
this
opinion
here
of
judge
browning,
this
is
a
dissent
on
the
issue
of
lineup.
as
i
read
judge
duniway's
opinion,
the
holding
there
was
no
motion
had
been
made
to
suppress
and
so
forth.
it's
not
very
informative
about
what
happened
at
the
lineup.
now
judge
browning's
opinion
has
this
short
paragraph,
“approximately
13
men
including
appellant
appeared
on
stage,
the
prisoners
were
identified
by
number.
they
were
required
to
pose
the
center
of
the
stage
individually,
turn,
try
on
various
articles
of
clothing,
and
answered
questions
including
whether
they
owned
an
automobile,
where
they
were
arrested,
and
whether
when
arrested,
they
were
armed.
they
were
required
to
say
certain
phrases
used
during
the
robberies,
“freeze,
this
is
a
stickup.
this
is
a
holdup.
this
is
a
heist.
don't
anyone
move.
empty
your
cash
drawer.”
to
shout
these
phrases
and
repeat
them
in
a
quiet
voice
while
standing
still
and
while
walking
both
normally
and
at
a
rapid
pace”.
now,
does
that
describe
what
actually
happened
if
you
understand
it
at
the
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
was
--
i'm
--
is
the
testimony
in
the
state
case
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it's
the
same
lineup?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
the
--
if
the
initial
search
was
--
its
not
the
--
there
was
no
probable
cause
in
the
part
of
the
officers
to
know
that
stuff
was
there.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
until
they
got
into
the
apartment
they
sought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
if
the
original
entry
was
illegal,
the
seizure
is
not
--
the
better
because,
ultimately
you've
got
a
search
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
concede
--
can't
you
concede
that
sure,
he
is
compelled.
of
course
he's
compelled,
even
the
fifth
amendment
says
that,
but
the
issue
is
what
is
compelled
from
him
is
something
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
is
it
testimonial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
the
aranda
rule
is,
in
circumstances
like
this,
an
advance
of
trial,
the
prosecution
is
under
duty
to
advise
the
defense
of
the
existence
of
the
statement
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
--
no,
no,
no,
i'd
say
what
is
the
aranda
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but,
how
was
the
defense
learned
that
there
were
such
a
statement
as
king?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
as
i
understand
it
--
did
i
understand
mr.
james
to
say
that
this
federal
trial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
for
a
different
robbery
from
the
verdict
trial,
that
--
from
the
robbery
involving
a
murder
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
were
the
inquiries
at
the
lineup
all
directed
to
--
pinning
all
of
these
robberies
on
gilbert
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
on
somebody
else?
