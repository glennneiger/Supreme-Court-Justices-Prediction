chief
justice
earl
warren
mister
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
sokolow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
a
state
contended
that
the
lineup
did
not
occur
as
was
recorded
in
the
opinion
in
the
federal
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
these
the
same
witnesses
in
the
federal
case
as
in
the
state
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
question
--
if
it's
a
question
of
--
if
you're
contending
that
some
lineups
are
legitimate
and
some
are
not
legitimate,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
very
important
for
us
to
know
what
happened
here.
and
if
the
state
knows
and
if
the
state
agrees
that
what
happened
in
the
federal
case
is
right,
i
would
take
that
it
would
make
such
a
concession
here
whether
it
happens
to
be
in
the
record
or
not.
what
were
interested
in
are
the
true
facts
of
this
situation,
are
we
not?
and
if
the
federal
court
was
right
in
finding
what
it
did
about
these
people
declaring
out
the
public,
“that's
the
man”
or
“that's
the
man”,
and
someone
else
is
the
man.
i
would
think
the
state
would
be
willing
to
concede
it
here
so,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
surely
some
investigation
was
made,
was
--
on
this
--
as
to
which
version
was
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
is
simply
this.
if
the
state
knows
that
that
did
happen
as
related
in
the
federal
case,
and
knows,
then
i
suppose,
we
all
would
know,
that
if
that
was
stated
to
the
jury
in
this
case,
that
it
might
have
affected
the
verdict
of
the
jury
that
the
state
would
concede
if
it
believes
that
to
be
the
fact.
now
if
you
don't
believe
it
to
be
the
fact,
why
--
entirely
different
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
as
i
understood
it,
it
grew
out
of
the
same
arrest
and
this
man
when
he
was
arrested,
he
said
he
would
talk
about
other
robberies
but
not
about
the
one
in
california,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
he
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
ordinary
or
usual
procedure
on
the
lineups
in
california,
or
isn't
it
on
ad
hoc
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
they've
did
that
the
police
do
just
what
they
think
the
circumstances
called
for
in
having
a
lineup?
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
recognized
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
here,
i
noticed
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
here
i
noticed
that
not
only
did
they
put
him
in
the
lineup
and
have
the
--
this
big
audience
out
there
watching
them
but
they
also
required
them
to
put
on
certain
clothes.
and
in
addition
to
that
thing,
they
cause
them
to
walk
both
fast
and
slow
and
then
they
asked
them
questions.
now,
is
it
common
in
california
to
make
a
man
dressed
up
for
a
--
in
a
way
where
--
to
highly
incriminate
him
in
a
lineup?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sokolow
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
all
they
can
do
at
the
trial
is
to
test
the
recollection
and
the
identification
of
the
witness,
is
there
anyway
that
an
illegal
lineup
could
be
tested,
shows
to
prevent
it
having
tainted
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
that
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sokolow
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
this
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
state's
position.
this
man
was
arrested
and
was
asked
to
make
a
statement,
he
said,
“i
will
not
make
a
statement
about
anything
occurred
here
in
california.
i'm
willing
to
discuss
with
you
any
charges
against
me
in
other
states”.
and
pursuant
to
that,
they
held
this
lineup
and
had
these
witnesses
at
the
california
robbery
in
the
audience
that
was
viewing
the
lineup
and
that
these
questions
that
were
asked
of
him
pertained
to
the
california
robbery
and
not
to
the
ones
in
the
other
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
(voice
overlap)
of
it
or
am
i
mistaken
in
that
--
in
those
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
so
the
lineup
was
before
he
made
that
statement,
was
it
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
had
he
ever
changed
his
statement
to
the
police
as
to
what
situation
he
is
willing
to
talk
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
make
any
search
of
the
house
at
this
particular
time?
the
first
time
they
were
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
one
more
question,
does
the
california
procedure
permit
the
defendant
in
such
circumstances
to
have
a
voir
dire
examination
or
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
lineup
or
must
he
do
that
in
that
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
california
practice,
his
counsel
would
know
that
he
had
a
right
to
bring
this
up
on
a
pretrial
motion
or
on
the
other
hand
that
he's
entitled
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
all
he
could
do
would
be
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
on
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
think
that
that
might
be
important
if
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
--
that
they're
not
entitled
to
any
relief
because
counsel
didn't
raised
this
on
voir
dire.
now
if
it
is
the
practice
and
the
court
recognized
it,
that
these
things
must
be
brought
up
in
that
manner
or
they
are
considered
waived
as
one
thing,
but
if
there
is
no
law
in
california
and
if
normally,
all
they're
entitled
to
is
to
test
the
credibility
of
witnesses
on
the
trial
itself,
you
would
have
your
--
have
a
different
situation
and
your
defense
on
that
regard
wouldn't
be
so
strong,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james,
we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
--
of
your
colleague
that
the
--
your
time
is
almost
up.
but
i'll
you
10
more
minutes
in
which
to
complete
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
the
same
jury
though
that
tried
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
james,
what
was
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
precise
reason
the
court
gave
for
setting
aside
the
conviction
of
king?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
that
confession
could
not
be
used
against
king,
and
the
man
who
gave
it
and
he
was
granted
a
new
trial
because
of
that.
why
does
the
state
insist
that
it
ought
to
--
it
could
be
used
to
whatever
extent?
the
jury
might
have
used
it
as
against
the
man
who
is
his
co-defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
gilbert.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
take
the
position
as
the
man
who
gave
it
was
entitled
to
have
a
new
trial
because
it
wasn't
properly
obtained
and
yet
they
used
it
against
the
man
concerning
whom
the
judge
had
said
it
was
hearsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
if
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
bad
against
one,
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
bad
against
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
told
that
--
you
take
that
it
was
not
prejudicial
against
this
man
largely
because
king
took
a
stand
and
testified
frankly
the
same
thing,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
lead
you
to
the
harmless
error
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
wonder
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
--
whether
you
use
the
testimony
that
king
gave
in
the
courtroom
against
gilbert,
and
as
a
result,
you
come
out
with
harmless
error,
why
wouldn't
that
same
testimony
that
king
gave
against
himself
in
the
courtroom
accomplished
the
same
result?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
if
he
took
the
stand
and
frankly
confessed
his
guilt,
well,
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
much
harmless
error
in
that
situation
as
it
would
as
against
this
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
we
would
agree
about
it,
will
you
do
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
will
you
--
would
you
just
leave
with
the
clerk
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

chief

mister
--
chief

very

mr.
sokolow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
a
state
contended
that
the
lineup
did
not
occur
as
was
recorded
in
the
opinion
in
the
federal
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
these
the
same
witnesses
in
the
federal
case
as
in
the
state
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
question
--
if
it's
a
question
of
--
if
you're
contending
that
some
lineups
are
legitimate
and
some
are
not
legitimate,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
very
important
for
us
to
know
what
happened
here.
and
if
the
state
knows
and
if
the
state
agrees
that
what
happened
in
the
federal
case
is
right,
i
would
take
that
it
would
make
such
a
concession
here
whether
it
happens
to
be
in

or
not.
what
were
interested
in
are
the
true
facts
of
this
situation,
are
we
not?
and
if
the
federal

was
right
in
finding
what
it

about
these
people
declaring
out

“that's
the

or
“that's

and
someone
else
is
the
man.
i
would
think
the
state
would
be
willing
to
concede
it
here
so,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
surely
some
investigation
was
made,
was
--
on
this
--
as
to
which
version
was
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
is
simply
this.
if
the
state
knows
that
that
did
happen
as
related
in
the
federal
case,
and
knows,
then
i
suppose,
we
all
would
know,
that
if
that
was
stated
to
the

in
this
case,
that
it
might
have
affected
the
verdict
of
the
jury
that
the
state
would
concede
if
it
believes
that
to
be
the
fact.
now
if
you
don't
believe
it
to
be
the
fact,
why
--
entirely
different
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
as
i
understood
it,
it
grew
out
of
the
same
arrest
and
this
man
when
he
was
arrested,
he
said
he
would
talk
about
other
robberies
but
not
about
the
one
in
california,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
he
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
ordinary
or
usual
procedure
on
the
lineups
in
california,
or
isn't
it
on

chief

what

this

chief

i
noticed

now,
is
it

to

if
all
they

at

how
could
that
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sokolow
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
this
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
state's
position.
this
man
was
arrested
and
was
asked
to
make
a
statement,
he
said,
“i
will
not
make
a
statement
about
anything
occurred
here
in
california.
i'm
willing
to
discuss
with
you
any
charges
against
me
in
other
states”.
and
pursuant
to
that,
they
held
this
lineup
and
had
these
witnesses
at
the
california
robbery
in
the
audience
that
was
viewing
the
lineup
and
that
these
questions
that
were
asked
of
him
pertained
to
the
california
robbery
and
not
to
the
ones
in
the

states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
(voice

of
it
or
am
i
mistaken
in
that
--
in
those
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
so
the
lineup
was
before
he
made
that
statement,
was
it
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
had
he
ever
changed
his
statement
to
the
police
as
to
what
situation
he
is
willing
to
talk
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
make
any
search
of
the
house
at
this
particular
time?
the
first
time
they
were
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
one
more
question,
does
the
california
procedure
permit
the
defendant
in
such
circumstances
to
have
a
voir
dire
examination
or
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
lineup
or
must
he
do
that
in
that
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
california
practice,
his
counsel
would
know
that
he
had
a
right
to
bring
this
up
on
a

on

other

that
he's
entitled
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
all
he
could
do
would
be
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
on
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
think
that
that
might
be
important
if
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
--
that
they're
not
entitled
to
any

because
counsel
didn't
raised
this
on

now
if
it
is
the

that

mr.

we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
--
of
your
colleague
that
the
--
your
time
is
almost
up.
but
i'll
you
10
more
minutes
in
which
to
complete
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
the
same
jury
though
that
tried
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
james,
what
was
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
precise
reason
the
court
gave
for
setting
aside
the
conviction
of
king?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
that
confession
could
not
be
used
against
king,
and
the
man
who
gave
it
and
he
was
granted
a
new
trial
because
of
that.
why
does
the
state
insist
that
it
ought
to
--
it
could
be
used
to
whatever
extent?
the
jury
might
have
used
it
as
against
the
man
who
is
his
co-defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
gilbert.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
take
the
position
as
the
man
who
gave
it
was
entitled
to
have
a
new
trial
because
it
wasn't
properly
obtained
and
yet
they
used
it
against
the
man
concerning
whom
the
judge
had
said
it
was
hearsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
if
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
bad
against
one,
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
bad
against
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
told
that
--
you
take
that
it
was
not
prejudicial
against
this
man
largely
because
king
took
a
stand
and
testified
frankly
the
same
thing,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
lead
you
to
the
harmless
error
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
wonder
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
--
whether
you
use
the
testimony
that
king
gave
in
the
courtroom
against
gilbert,
and
as
a
result,
you
come
out
with
harmless
error,
why
wouldn't
that
same
testimony
that
king
gave
against
himself
in
the
courtroom
accomplished
the
same
result?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
if
he
took
the
stand
and
frankly
confessed
his
guilt,
well,
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
much
harmless
error
in
that
situation
as
it
would
as
against
this
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
we
would
agree
about
it,
will
you
do
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
will
you
--
would
you
just
leave
with
the
clerk
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
mckissack.
