justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
was
constitutionally
--
illegally
obtained?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
upheld
but
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
was
that
confession
of
the
co-defendant
illegally
obtained?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
--
do
you
think
these
facts
would
satisfy
escobedo
as
read
in
miranda?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
what
their
counsel
--
did
he
request
counsel
and
was
it
reviewed?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
set
of
the
facts
--
you
not
satisfy
escobedo
as
read
in
miranda,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
what
--
that
the
california
court
held
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
this
was
illegal
--
an
illegally
obtained
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
under
miranda,
it's
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
that
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
did
this
happen?
this
happened
before
--
when
did
it
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
isn't
credit
carrier
case
anyway,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
credit
carrier
case
anyway
whether
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
this
confession
of
his
co-defendant
was
coerced
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suggest?
some
kind
of
a
general
rule
against
the
admissibility
of
co-defendant's
confession,
did
they
implicate
the
other
fellow
or
are
you
saying
just
in
a
specific
case
like
this
one,
it
maybe
that
in
this
particular
case
there's
an
unfair
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
evidence
--
offers
with
respect
to
statements
in
the
lineup.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
suggesting
an
--
a
wholly
automatic
rule
that
counsel
must
be
present
during
a
lineup.
and
if
he's
not
present
during
a
lineup,
any
courtroom
identification
is
tainted
by
the
identification
that
the
lineup
which
counsel
wasn't
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
not
--
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
actually
happens
at
the
lineup,
whether
it
was
fair,
unfair
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
have
to
reach
this
in
your
case
because
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unless
there's
a
categorical
rule
you
have
to
get
to
the
facts
to
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
there's
some
unfairness
at
the
lineup.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
contending
for,
the
categorical
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
too
severe?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
was
that
the
--
what
if
a
--
what
if
the
courtroom
identification
rested
a
deal
on
memories
of
a
fellow
--
that
the
witness
knew
the
--
identified
this
person
once
before
at
the
lineup
and
he
real
--
and
he
--
and
has
been
quite
a
while
and
so
he
does
rely
on
the
--
on
his
lineup
identification.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
wasn't
counsel
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
counsel
was
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
witness
testifies
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
but
it
says,
“well,
do
you
--
are
you
relying
on
your
lineup
identification?”
he
answers,
“well,
yes,
yes.”
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
mind
a
good
deal,
“i
identified
the
man?
i
identify
--
identify
him
now."
justice
byron
r.
white
who
made
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
made
any
findings
with
respect
to
this
matter
in
the
federal
case?the
court
of
appeals
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
there
a
reading
in
the
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
were
taken
pursuant
to
a
warrant
with
the
exception
of
the
photographs?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sokolow,
what
were
the
items
seized
on
the
search
warrant
subsequent?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
drawing?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
the
compulsion
with
respect
to
the
handwriting
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
mean
it's
compulsion
in
the
miranda
sense
and
that
there
was
a
question
or
a
suggestion
in
the
context
of
the
--
that
the
context
of
a
custody
that
--
is
that
as
much
compulsion
as
there
was
that
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that,
but
how
about
compulsion?
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
think
there's
still
a
question
of
compulsion.
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
--
the
other
question
too.
when
did
this
trial
take
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it's
only
compulsion
in
the
sense
that
these
events
took
place
in
that
--
in
custody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
nobody
forced
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
really
forced
anybody
to
do
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
physical
or
mental
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
have
--
if
the
only
reason
is
that
you
would
say
he's
compelled
is
in
the
miranda
sense,
then
the
question
arises
whether
a
new
rule
like
miranda
would
apply
to
a
--
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
understand
what
mr.
justice
clark
and
i'm
concerned
with
this
too.
we
looked
at
this
record
at
page
numbers
to
which
mr.
sokolow
referred
as
bearing
on
what
occurred
at
the
lineup
and
the
pages
do
not
bear
on
what
occurs
at
the
lineup
--
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
them
was
whether
the
respective
juror
believes
in
capital
punishment,
and
the
other
similar
sort
of
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
just
refer
us
to
the
volume
and
the
page
where
there
is
any
evidence
referring
on
what
occurred
at
the
lineup.
that's
what
i'd
like.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
came
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
--
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
with
respect
to
his
previous
confession
or
statements
that
he
made
previously
in
addition
to
what
he
testified
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
was
constitutionally
--
illegally
obtained?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
upheld
but
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
was
that
confession
of
the
co-defendant
illegally
obtained?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
--
do
you
think
these
facts
would
satisfy
escobedo
as
read
in
miranda?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
what
their
counsel
--
did
he
request
counsel
and
was
it
reviewed?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
set
of
the
facts
--
you
not
satisfy
escobedo
as
read
in
miranda,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
what
--
that
the
california
court
held
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
this
was
illegal
--
an
illegally
obtained
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
under
miranda,
it's
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
that
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
did
this
happen?
this
happened
before
--
when
did
it
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
isn't
credit
carrier
case
anyway,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
credit
carrier
case
anyway
whether
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
this
confession
of
his
co-defendant
was
coerced
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suggest?
some
kind
of
a
general
rule
against
the
admissibility
of
co-defendant's
confession,
did
they
implicate
the
other
fellow
or
are
you
saying
just
in
a
specific
case
like
this
one,
it
maybe
that
in
this
particular
case
there's
an
unfair
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
evidence
--
offers
with
respect
to
statements
in
the
lineup.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
suggesting
an
--
a
wholly
automatic
rule
that
counsel
must
be
present
during
a
lineup.
and
if
he's
not
present
during
a
lineup,
any
courtroom
identification
is
tainted
by
the
identification
that
the
lineup
which
counsel
wasn't
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
not
--
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
actually
happens
at
the
lineup,
whether
it
was
fair,
unfair
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
have
to
reach
this
in
your
case
because
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unless
there's
a
categorical
rule
you
have
to
get
to
the
facts
to
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
there's
some
unfairness
at
the
lineup.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
contending
for,
the
categorical
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
too
severe?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
was
that
the
--
what
if
a
--
what
if
the
courtroom
identification
rested
a
deal
on
memories
of
a
fellow
--
that
the
witness
knew
the
--
identified
this
person
once
before
at
the
lineup
and
he
real
--
and
he
--
and
has
been
quite
a
while
and
so
he
does
rely
on
the
--
on
his
lineup
identification.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
wasn't
counsel
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
counsel
was
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
witness
testifies
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
but
it
says,
“well,
do
you
--
are
you
relying
on
your
lineup
identification?”
he
answers,
“well,
yes,
yes.”
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
mind
a
good
deal,
“i
identified
the
man?
i
identify
--
identify
him
now."
justice
byron
r.
white
who
made
the

justice
byron

white
well,
who
made
any
findings
with
respect
to
this
matter
in
the

and
what's
(voice

--
justice

oh,
you
mean
it's
compulsion
in
the

sense
and
that
there
was
a
question
or
a
suggestion
in
the
context
of
the

how
would

i
know
that,
but
how
about
compulsion?
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
byron

white
yes,
but
i
think
there's
still
a
question
of
compulsion.
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
--
the
other
question
too.
when
did
this
trial
take
place?
justice
byron

and
if
it's
only
compulsion
in
the
sense
that
these
events
took
place
in
that

in

justice
byron

and
that
nobody

justice

nobody
really
forced
anybody

justice

there
was
no

that
have

if
the
