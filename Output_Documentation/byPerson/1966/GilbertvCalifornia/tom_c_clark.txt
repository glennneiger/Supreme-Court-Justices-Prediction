justice

c.

is
that
routine
in
california
that
you
ask
them
on
the
lineup,
ask
questions?
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
is
the
record
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
if
it
comes
to
the
record.
justice
tom
c.

so,
we
have
just
one
copy
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
information
with
the
reference
to
these
questions
is
at
page
157,

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
those
are
the
only
reference
to?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
do
you
mean
calling
out
numbers?
i
don't
understand.
were
they
--
he
--
suspect
numbered
in
the
lineup?
justice
tom
c.
clark
now,
who
asked
the
questions,
police
officer
or
district
attorney,
who?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
questioning
is
not
the
purpose
of
identification
of
the
voice,
is
it?
it
couldn't
be
if
they're
asking
about
their
car?
i
suppose
they
were
trying
to
find
out
if
that
was
a
car
that
the
escapist
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
was
his
answer
that
the
--
it
was
his
car,
that
he
was
in
the
car?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
mean
the
record
you
referred
me
to
doesn't
appear?
justice
tom
c.
clark
we
don't
know
whether
he
answered
it
or
not,
did
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
suppose
--
i
thought
you
were
admitting
the
he
answered
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
we
know
there
might
have
several
(inaudible),
i'm
not
going
to
answer
that
or
if
you
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
you
don't
know
whether
he
answered
it
all
--
about
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
this
show
the
answers?
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
the
federal
reporter
show
the
answers?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
see,
that's
pretty
a
close
question
that
--
and
this
lineup
when
you
mingle
with
it,
testimonial
compulsion
would
--
makes
it
almost
an
impossible
question.
it's
pretty
an
important
point,
factually,
to
me.
well,
that's
why
i
was
asking
you
about
whether
it
was
unanswered.
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
do
you
get
in
that
if
you
can't
identify?
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
do
you
get
into
that
even
if
you
don't
know
the
identity
of
the
defendant?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
just
framing
it
up,
wouldn't
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
they
don't
ask
the
same
questions
with
each
number,
do
they?
i
suppose
they'd
asked
number
1
about
his
--
what
they
thought
he
was
doing,
and
number
2
about
his,
trying
to
correlate
them,
won't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
that
--
this
paragraph
here
wouldn't
necessarily
refer
to
this
case
here,
would
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
unfortunate
if
you
didn't
have
a
record.
is
there
any
other
record
besides
the
one
you
have?

what's
the

appeals
go
(inaudible)
on
a

on
the
hot
pursuit
of

the

did
this

the

(inaudible)
justice
tom

so
long
for
that

justice
tom

do
you
agree
with
your
adversary
statement
that
there
was
no
motion
for
a

either
a
mistrial
or
a
separate
trial
at
any
stage
in

when
this

a

when
the

justice

is
that

there's
nothing
in
