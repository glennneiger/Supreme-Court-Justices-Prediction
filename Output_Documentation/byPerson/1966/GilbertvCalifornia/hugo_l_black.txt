are
you

justice

are
you
defending
to
any

on
that
doctrine
in

justice

l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
he
was
compelled
to
speak
after
being
put
in
the
lineup?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
purpose
of
compelling
him
to
talk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
or
the
government
can
take
the
person
and
put
him
in
a
lineup
and
compel
him
to
answer
questions
which
might
be
used
against
him
or
which
might
supply
the
fruits
of
--
or
using
it
against
him
and
if
that
would
be
legal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
i'm
talking
about,
compel
either
to
write
something
for
the
state
to
use
against
him
on
either
an
investigation
or
in
a
trial
are
compelled
to
make
statements
for
the
state
to
use
against
him
in
connection
with
the
--
his
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
that
if
that's
to
be
used
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
of
a
direct
confession
and
statement
of
facts
which
will
help
the
state
folds
the
link
of
its
chains
about
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
officers
did
here
--
get
this
man,
take
him
into
a
lineup,
and
then
compel
him
to
answer
questions
or
compel
him
to
write
something
which
was
helpful
to
the
state
in
bringing
about
his
conviction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fellow
--
that
man
has
to
be
identified
before
he
can
be
charged
i
suppose,
so
that's
to
--
helping
to
get
evidence
to
prove
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
took
him
from
his
cell,
did
they
not?
ordered
him
to
go
down,
to
go
through
this
proceeding,
did
he
go
down
there
of
his
own
accord
and
say
i
want
to
go
down
to
be
viewed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i
assume,
there
can
be
no
doubt,
can't
it,
that
if
a
person
doesn't
know
another
--
wants
to
help
identify
him
by
his
voice,
that
requiring
this
man
to
talk
in
his
presence
would
be
testimonial,
could
there
be
any
doubt
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
incriminated
himself
by
using
his
voice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
a
facial
expression
or
a
shake
of
the
head
or
a
nod
in
the
head
can
be
the
same
as
a
confession
in
a
long
words,
can't
it?
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
fact
that
a
motion
can
be
a
confession
or
tend
in
that
direction.
your
answer
to
that
point
as
i
gather
is
that
he
did
not
raise
that
on
the
voir
dire.
you
know
he
may
