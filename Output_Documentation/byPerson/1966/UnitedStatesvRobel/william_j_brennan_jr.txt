justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
list,
were
revised
periodically
in
this
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
3000
would
have
been
of
the
3000
today
designated
and
made
it
more
or
less
from
time
to
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
eliminated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
like
mohawk
power,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
maroney,
where
one
of
these
facilities
has
a
government
contract.
if
they're
reserved
any
longer
with
the
kind
of
provision
we
had
in
greene
and
mcelroy
it
would
go
the
right
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
other
words,
this
gets
back
to
something
to
chief
justice
to
get
supporters
of
that
earlier.
i
just
wonder,
aren't
those
incriminate
these
--
well,
they
actually
have
a
contract
with
one
of
these
facilities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
they
reserve
some
right
to
say
that
you
must
not
allow
particular
employee
to
be
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
they
have
told
us
that
this
yard
about
the
time
ms.
chapp
was
employed,
do
i
understand
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
government
contracts
to
build
those
guided
missile
destroyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
working
there
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
control
goes
to
those
who
may
have
access,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
from
the
government
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
maroney,
one
other
question.
suppose
this
yard,
in
addition
to
the
work
that
he
gave
at
the
designation
of
the
defense
system,
also
the
general
repair
and
construction
works
say
in
private
yachts
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
this
respondent
i
gather
were
employed
exclusively
whatever
work
he
does
on
those
private
yachts,
nevertheless
the
statute
would
--
could
send
him
to
jail
for
five
years,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
why
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest
that
if
there
were
a
time
when
this
yard
did
absolutely
nothing
except
work
on
private
ships.
let's
say
they're
all
private
yachts,
they
never
did
anything
else
and
hadn't
for
years.
it
might,
nevertheless,
be
designated
as
a
facility
because
maybe
someday,
it
might
be
useful
to
have
that
as
a
repair
ship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
this
yard,
mr.
maroney.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
had
nothing
--
never
for
years
done
anything
except
private
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
regardless
of
whichever
use
and
so
on,
for
that
sole
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless,
theoretically
this
could
be
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
designated
this
way
and
never
used
and
so
on.
and
this
man
go
to
jail
for
five
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
situation
i
put
mr.
maroney,
where
they
never
had
any
--
and
hadn't
for
years
had
any
of
it,
but
it's
designated
only
because
of
its
potential
capacity,
which
on
of
the
five
would
come
in
to
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abt,
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
5
(a)
(2)
(b),
that's
the
one
authorizing
the
designation
of
facilities
invulnerable
to
charge
of
excessive
congressional
delegation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that.
i
know
that
you
believe
that
it
doesn't
argue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
wonder,
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
about
schechter's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
in
the
books,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
is
--
if
this
is,
then
i
guess
the
question
you
are
now
arguing,
we
wouldn't
have
to
reach,
would
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
if
this
is
excessive
delegation
within
panama
and
schechter
and
the
others,
then
i
take
it,
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aptheker
did
involve
constitutional
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
different
constitutional
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
suppose
that
it
concerned
you
too
much
that
this
one
off
in
schechter
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
this,
wonder
why
it's
argued
at
that
way,
mr.
abt,
i
thought
that
he
said
was
that
the
1%
of
3000
was
the
facilities
that
he
did
not
know
the
number
of
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abt,
is
it
your
position
the
government
would
also
have
to
prove
that
the
shipyard
is
a
defense
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
merely,
a
government-proof
limited
to
the
fact
of
the
secretary
of
defense.
it
designated
that
way,
that
as
such.
you
say
it
would
not
be
sufficient.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
maroney?
i
think
when
this
case
was
last
argued,
this
man
--
what's
his
name
--
robel
was
still
being
employed
at
this
defense
facility,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
hasn't
been
too
much
of
a
threat
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
years
is
he
employed
there,
10
or
12
years
or
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
he
has
been
employed
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
it
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
president
and
the
department
of
justice,
both
at
that
time
suggested
that
the
existing
security
programs
required
only
the
slightest
modification
to
do
everything
that
the
statute
afforded
to
do.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
what
they
represented
was
that
the
existing
programs
required
only
a
slight
modification
completely
to
cover
it.
that's
what
the
--
i
would
call
that
that's
what
the
house
supported.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
review,
mr.
maroney,
anywhere
of
the
secretary
of
defense's
designation
of
a
particular
facility
as
a
defense
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anywhere
a
provision
for
review
either
administrative
or
judicial
of
a
designation
made
by
the
secretary
of
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
in
the
defending
under
this
indictment,
a
challenge
could
be
in
interposed
by
way
of
defense
to
the
designation
of
this
shipyard
as
a
defense
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
to
say
then
he
doesn't
even
have
a
defense
if
this
is
not
a
defense
facility
to
the
criminal
prosecution,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
by
what
standard
would
the
court
determine
that?
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
does,
then
i
take
it
all
the
government
has
to
prove
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
an
action
organization,
that
the
secretary
designated
this
particular
place
of
employment
as
a
defense
facility,
that
he
was
still
employed
there
notwithstanding
the
direction
he
registered
his
organization
as
an
action
organization,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
what
defense
has
he
got?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
those
would
be
hard
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
pull
that
much,
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
he
knew
of
the
designation
of
the
party
or
the
nomination
of
the
party
as
an
action
organization
that
he
himself
is
a
member
of
that
organization.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
place
was
a
defense
facility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
no
matter
what
it
maybe
that
the
secretary
of
defense
picks
up
and
labels
defense
result,
that's
an
unreviewable
designation
in
either
administratively
or
judicially
or
even
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
authorize
--
what's
as
the
matter
of
law?
what
authorizes
the
court
to
make
a
designation
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
secretary
of
defense
erred
in
designating
this
particular
shift
for
the
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
this
mean?
as
i
get
it,
what
he
may
designate
as
a
defense
facility
as
any
plant,
factory
or
other
manufacturing,
producing
or
servicing
establishment?
i
take
it
that
would
be
the
longer
you
tailor
the
things
--
military
uniforms.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
airport
facility
vessel
here,
waterfront
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory
station
or
other
establishment
or
facility
or
any
part,
division
or
department
of
any
that
foregoes.
that's
very
broad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
determination
is
reviewable
by
nobody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
maroney,
i
gather
--
we
approach
this
problem
on
the
premise
don't
we
that
the
right
to
hold
specific
body
of
employment
is
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right,
isn't
it?
does
this
court
say
that
in
the
greene
and
mcelroy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
read
it
for
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
free
from
unreasonable
governmental
interference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
think
that
it's
a
reasonable
governmental
interference
to
regulate
that
right
from
the
case
of
members
of
action
organization
to
the
extent
of
denying
him
employment
anywhere
that
it
is
unreviewable
discussion
the
secretary
of
defense
designates
facility
as
defense
facilities
which
bargain
from
employment.
at
least,
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
told
me
it
was
unreviewable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
reviewable
is
that
what's
not
reviewable.
no
one
can
be
prosecuted
who
is
a
member
of
an
actual
organization
with
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
been
ordered
to
(inaudible).
no
one
can
be
prosecuted
for
working
in
private
employment
from
the
statute
unless
the
facility
in
which
he
works
has
been
designated
a
defense
facility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
opening
basis
in
there
which
the
prosecution
begins
and
that
determination
is
not
reviewable
by
anybody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
don't
follow.
i
don't
follow
that.
is
the
government
conceding
then
that
the
real
federal
review
of
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
a
designation
of
a
particular
facility
by
the
secretary
of
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute
for
the
legislative
history?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
circumstances
ever
appear.
all
that
this
indictment
alleges
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
but
in
such
and
such
a
date,
the
todd
shipyard
was
designated
a
defense
facility
by
the
secretary
of
defense
that
the
--
he
was
working
there
at
the
time
and
with
knowledge
of
the
designation
and
knowledge
of
the
requirement
that
the
party
was
ordered
to
register,
he
continued
in
his
inquiry,
that's
all
there
is,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
and
he
can
interpose
you're
telling
us
now
a
defense
that
the
secretary's
designation
of
todd
shipyard
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
i
take
it,
he
may
change
anytime
he
wishes
to,
can't
he?
nothing
binding
about
those
though,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
can
make
it
six,
seven,
20,
25
nothing
the
statute
says
you
can't
do.
incidentally
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
significance
in
this?
the
act
provides
rather
elaborately
for
both
administrative
determination
and
judicial
review
of
the
matter
whether
a
particular
organization
is
an
action
organization,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
it's
significant
that
the
act
makes
no
provision
whatever
for
any
kind
of
review
of
the
secretary's
designation
as
bearing
on
whether
congress
intended
that
that
designation
should
be
anywhere
subject
to
these,
even
on
a
basis
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
you
suggest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
obviously,
you
can
see
that's
the
thing
that's
bothering
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly.
that's
why
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
suggest
that
nevertheless
if
it's
something
called
arbitrary
and
capricious,
a
court
can
do
something
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
how
you
prove
it's
arbitrary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
there,
you
weren't
were
we
dealing
with
a
right
--
constitutional
guaranteed
right
as
here,
the
right
to
regulate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
constitutional
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
--
we
have
another
question.
even
if
it
has
power
to
pass
it,
is
this
the
way
constitutionally
can
be
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
there
might
be
a
difference,
mr.
abt,
between
teaching
and
working
in
a
defense
department?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
keyishian
only
involved
teaching.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
everybody
involved
there
is
a
teacher.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
forget
these
things
pretty
quickly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
get
back
to
the
question.
don't
you
think
there
may
be
a
difference
between
teaching
and
working
for
this
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
on
the
question
whether
it
can
be
a
prophylactic
rule
if
it
reaches
all
communists
as
long
as
he's
a
member
of
the
organization
without
regard
to
whether
the
kind
you
say
robel
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
so?
i'm
not
so
sure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
list,
were
revised
periodically
in
this
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
3000
would
have
been
of
the
3000
today
designated
and
made
it
more
or
less
from
time
to
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
eliminated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
like
mohawk
power,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
maroney,
where
one
of
these
facilities
has
a
government
contract.
if
they're
reserved
any
longer
with
the
kind
of
provision
we
had
in
greene
and
mcelroy
it
would
go
the
right
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
other
words,
this
gets
back
to
something
to
chief
justice
to
get
supporters
of
that
earlier.
i
just
wonder,
aren't
those
incriminate
these
--
well,
they
actually
have
a
contract
with
one
of
these
facilities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
they
reserve
some
right
to
say
that
you
must
not
allow
particular
employee
to
be
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
they
have
told
us
that
this
yard
about
the
time
ms.
chapp
was
employed,
do
i
understand
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
government
contracts
to
build
those
guided
missile
destroyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
working
there
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
control
goes
to
those
who
may
have
access,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
from
the
government
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
maroney,
one
other
question.
suppose
this
yard,
in
addition
to
the
work
that
he
gave
at
the
designation
of
the
defense
system,
also
the
general
repair
and
construction
works
say
in
private
yachts
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
this
respondent
i
gather
were
employed
exclusively
whatever
work
he
does
on
those
private
yachts,
nevertheless
the
statute
would
--
could
send
him
to
jail
for
five
years,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
why
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest
that
if
there
were
a
time
when
this
yard
did
absolutely
nothing
except
work
on
private
ships.
let's
say
they're
all
private
yachts,
they
never
did
anything
else
and
hadn't
for
years.
it
might,
nevertheless,
be
designated
as
a
facility
because
maybe
someday,
it
might
be
useful
to
have
that
as
a
repair
ship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
this
yard,
mr.
maroney.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
had
nothing
--
never
for
years
done
anything
except
private
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
regardless
of
whichever
use
and
so
on,
for
that
sole
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless,
theoretically
this
could
be
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
designated
this
way
and
never
used
and
so
on.
and
this
man
go
to
jail
for
five
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
situation
i
put
mr.
maroney,
where
they
never
had
any
--
and
hadn't
for
years
had
any
of
it,
but
it's
designated
only
because
of
its
potential
capacity,
which
on
of
the
five
would
come
in
to
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abt,
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
5
(a)
(2)
(b),
that's
the
one
authorizing
the
designation
of
facilities
invulnerable
to
charge
of
excessive
congressional
delegation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that.
i
know
that
you
believe
that
it
doesn't
argue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
wonder,
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
about
schechter's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
in
the
books,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
is
--
if
this
is,
then
i
guess
the
question
you
are
now
arguing,
we
wouldn't
have
to
reach,
would
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
if
this
is
excessive
delegation
within
panama
and
schechter
and
the
others,
then
i
take
it,
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aptheker
did
involve
constitutional
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
different
constitutional
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
suppose
that
it
concerned
you
too
much
that
this
one
off
in
schechter
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
this,
wonder
why
it's
argued
at
that
way,
mr.
abt,
i
thought
that
he
said
was
that
the
1%
of
3000
was
the
facilities
that
he
did
not
know
the
number
of
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abt,
is
it
your
position
the
government
would
also
have
to
prove
that
the
shipyard
is
a
defense
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
merely,
a
government-proof
limited
to
the
fact
of
the
secretary
of
defense.
it
designated
that
way,
that
as
such.
you
say
it
would
not
be
sufficient.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
maroney?
i
think
when
this
case
was
last
argued,
this
man
--
what's
his
name
--
robel
was
still
being
employed
at
this
defense
facility,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
hasn't
been
too
much
of
a
threat
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
years
is
he
employed
there,
10
or
12
years
or
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
he
has
been
employed
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
it
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
president
and
the
department
of
justice,
both
at
that
time
suggested
that
the
existing
security
programs
required
only
the
slightest
modification
to
do
everything
that
the
statute
afforded
to
do.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
what
they
represented
was
that
the
existing
programs
required
only
a
slight
modification
completely
to
cover
it.
that's
what
the
--
i
would
call
that
that's
what
the
house
supported.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
review,
mr.
maroney,
anywhere
of
the
secretary
of
defense's
designation
of
a
particular
facility
as
a
defense
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anywhere
a
provision
for
review
either
administrative
or
judicial
of
a
designation
made
by
the
secretary
of
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
in
the
defending
under
this
indictment,
a
challenge
could
be
in
interposed
by
way
of
defense
to
the
designation
of
this
shipyard
as
a
defense
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
to
say
then
he
doesn't
even
have
a
defense
if
this
is
not
a
defense
facility
to
the
criminal
prosecution,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
by
what
standard
would
the
court
determine
that?
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
does,
then
i
take
it
all
the
government
has
to
prove
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
an
action
organization,
that
the
secretary
designated
this
particular
place
of
employment
as
a
defense
facility,
that
he
was
still
employed
there
notwithstanding
the
direction
he
registered
his
organization
as
an
action
organization,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
what
defense
has
he
got?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
those
would
be
hard
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
pull
that
much,
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
he
knew
of
the
designation
of
the
party
or
the
nomination
of
the
party
as
an
action
organization
that
he
himself
is
a
member
of
that
organization.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
place
was
a
defense
facility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
no
matter
what
it
maybe
that
the
secretary
of
defense
picks
up
and
labels
defense
result,
that's
an
unreviewable
designation
in
either
administratively
or
judicially
or
even
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
authorize
--
what's
as
the
matter
of
law?
what
authorizes
the
court
to
make
a
designation
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
secretary
of
defense
erred
in
designating
this
particular
shift
for
the
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
this
mean?
as
i
get
it,
what
he
may
designate
as
a
defense
facility
as
any
plant,
factory
or
other
manufacturing,
producing
or
servicing
establishment?
i
take
it
that
would
be
the
longer
you
tailor
the
things
--
military
uniforms.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
airport
facility
vessel
here,
waterfront
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory
station
or
other
establishment
or
facility
or
any
part,
division
or
department
of
any
that
foregoes.
that's
very
broad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
determination
is
reviewable
by
nobody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
maroney,
i
gather
--
we
approach
this
problem
on
the
premise
don't
we
that
the
right
to
hold
specific
body
of
employment
is
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right,
isn't
it?
does
this
court
say
that
in
the
greene
and
mcelroy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
read
it
for
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
free
from
unreasonable
governmental
interference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
think
that
it's
a
reasonable
governmental
interference
to
regulate
that
right
from
the
case
of
members
of
action
organization
to
the
extent
of
denying
him
employment
anywhere
that
it
is
unreviewable
discussion
the
secretary
of
defense
designates
facility
as
defense
facilities
which
bargain
from
employment.
at
least,
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
told
me
it
was
unreviewable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
reviewable
is
that
what's
not
reviewable.
no
one
can
be
prosecuted
who
is
a
member
of
an
actual
organization
with
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
been
ordered
to
(inaudible).
no
one
can
be
prosecuted
for
working
in
private
employment
from
the
statute
unless
the
facility
in
which
he
works
has
been
designated
a
defense
facility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
opening
basis
in
there
which
the
prosecution
begins
and
that
determination
is
not
reviewable
by
anybody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
don't
follow.
i
don't
follow
that.
is
the
government
conceding
then
that
the
real
federal
review
of
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
a
designation
of
a
particular
facility
by
the
secretary
of
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute
for
the
legislative
history?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
circumstances
ever
appear.
all
that
this
indictment
alleges
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
but
in
such
and
such
a
date,
the
todd
shipyard
was
designated
a
defense
facility
by
the
secretary
of
defense
that
the
--
he
was
working
there
at
the
time
and
with
knowledge
of
the
designation
and
knowledge
of
the
requirement
that
the
party
was
ordered
to
register,
he
continued
in
his
inquiry,
that's
all
there
is,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
and
he
can
interpose
you're
telling
us
now
a
defense
that
the
secretary's
designation
of
todd
shipyard
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
i
take
it,
he
may
change
anytime
he
wishes
to,
can't
he?
nothing
binding
about
those
though,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
can
make
it
six,
seven,
20,
25
nothing
the
statute
says
you
can't
do.
incidentally
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
significance
in
this?
the
act
provides
rather
elaborately
for
both
administrative
determination
and
judicial
review
of
the
matter
whether
a
particular
organization
is
an
action
organization,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
it's
significant
that
the
act
makes
no
provision
whatever
for
any
kind
of
review
of
the
secretary's
designation
as
bearing
on
whether
congress
intended
that
that
designation
should
be
anywhere
subject
to
these,
even
on
a
basis
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
you
suggest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
obviously,
you
can
see
that's
the
thing
that's
bothering
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly.
that's
why
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
suggest
that
nevertheless
if
it's
something
called
arbitrary
and
capricious,
a
court
can
do
something
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
how
you
prove
it's
arbitrary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
there,
you
weren't
were
we
dealing
with
a
right
--
constitutional
guaranteed
right
as
here,
the
right
to
regulate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
constitutional
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
--
we
have
another
question.
even
if
it
has
power
to
pass
it,
is
this
the
way
constitutionally
can
be
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
there
might
be
a
difference,
mr.
abt,
between
teaching
and
working
in
a
defense
department?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
keyishian
only
involved
teaching.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
everybody
involved
there
is
a
teacher.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
forget
these
things
pretty
quickly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
get
back
to
the
question.
don't
you
think
there
may
be
a
difference
between
teaching
and
working
for
this
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
on
the
question
whether
it
can
be
a
prophylactic
rule
if
it
reaches
all
communists
as
long
as
he's
a
member
of
the
organization
without
regard
to
whether
the
kind
you
say
robel
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
so?
i'm
not
so
sure.
