mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
outset,
something
that
i
think
mr.
maroney
said,
but
--
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case
and
that
is
that
this
statute
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
person
to
work
in
a
facility
that
the
secretary
of
defense
has
designated
as
a
defense
facility
solely
because
of
the
bare
fact
that
he
holds
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization
that
has
been
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
now,
judge
lindberg,
the
district
judge
thought
and
i
think
quite
properly
that
the
statute
of
this
time
applies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
scales
case
and
more
pertinently
in
the
aptheker
case.
and
in
order
to
get
around
what
he
considered
to
be
that
constitutional
infirmity
in
reluctant
to
declare
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional,
he
reinterpreted
the
statute
by
reading
into
it
elements
that
the
statute
doesn't
have.
that
is
to
say
the
element
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
accused
that
the
organization
of
which
he
is
a
member
has
an
unlawful
purpose,
an
intent
to
effectuate
that
purpose
and
activity
looking
to
that
entity.
and
it's
so
construed,
he
said,
the
statute
might
be
constitutional
and
he
therefore
dismissed
the
indictment
because
it
doesn't
contain
these
allegations.
now,
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
statute
doesn't
bear
the
construction,
but
judge
lindberg
gave
it.
and
on
that
question,
it's
your
decision
in
aptheker's
controlling,
that
the
aptheker
said
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
about
section
6
of
the
act.
section
6
makes
the
bare
fact
of
membership
in
an
organization
that
has
been
order
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization,
a
disqualification
for
obtaining
a
passport.
the
court
said
you
can't
cure
this
statute
by
reading
the
elements
of
knowledge
and
intent
and
activity
into
it.
and
that
decision
with
respect
to
section
6,
i
submit,
is
applicable
with
equal
force
to
the
section
we
have
here
today.
now,
in
the
absence
of
these
elements,
knowledge
--
guilty
knowledge
activity
and
intent,
i
submit
that
the
section
is
unconstitutional
in
the
first
place
because
it
violates
the
due
process
principle
that
the
government
may
not
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
interfere
with
the
right
of
an
individual
to
hold
specified
private
employment.
mr.
maroney
defends
the
statute
as
a
reasonable
measure
in
the
interest
of
protecting
the
national
security.
but
if
the
government
had
deliberately
setout
to
find
a
case
which
would
most
strikingly
illustrate
the
fallacy
of
that
claim,
it
couldn't
have
done
better
than
to
pick
this
one.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes
sir,
it's
the
union
out
there.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
machinist
union.
to
send
robel
to
prison,
under
this
indictment,
would
not
only
deprive
him
of
his
personal
liberty,
and
todd,
a
good
machinist,
that
it
would
chip
away
at
the
freedom
of
every
american
and
for
no
conceivable
or
discernable
purpose.
because
robel
and
others
like
him
who
as
the
government's
brief
concedes
and
i
quote
from
it,
“would
never
consider
committing
either
espionage
or
sabotage,
post
no
conceivable
threat
to
our
national
security”,
or
would
there
conviction
and
sentenced
under
this
statute
served
any
legitimate
governmental
interest.
the
invalidity
of
this
indiscriminate
restraint
of
the
right
to
work
is
established
by
the
decision
in
aptheker
which
invalidated
the
similar
indiscriminate
restriction
of
section
6
of
the
act
on
the
right
to
travel.
and
i
must
say
that
i
consider
it
a
real
feat
on
mr.
maroney's
part
to
have
talked
about
this
case
for
55
minutes
before
he
mentioned
the
aptheker
case.
because
the
two
are,
from
a
legal
point
of
view
on
this
question
is
like
this
two-piece
in
a
pod,
section
5
like
section
6
applies
to
members
who
do
not
know
that
the
communist
party
has
any
unlawful
purpose
and
who
believed
that
the
finding
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
that
the
communist
party
is
a
soviet
agent,
he
spoke
on
truthful
and
unwarranted.
the
section
is
therefore
invalid
because
in
aptheker's
words,
and
i
quote
from
it,
it
sweeps
within
its
prohibition
both
knowing
and
unknowing
members.
furthermore,
section
5
like
section
6,
again
to
quote
aptheker,
also
renders
a
relevant,
the
member's
degree
of
activity
in
the
organization
and
his
commitment
to
its
purpose.
furthermore,
section
5
as
aptheker
said
of
section
6,
excludes
consideration
of
additional
relevant
factors.
it
applies
to
every
job
in
an
establishment
that's
been
designated
as
a
defense
facility
even
to
jobs
which
from
a
security
point
of
view
are
completely
insensitive.
and
it
applies
to
all
members
of
the
organization
who
hold
these
jobs,
even
though
in
doing
so,
they
are
motivated
by
nothing
more
dangerous
than
the
common
desire
of
all
us
to
earn
a
living.
section
6
like
--
or
section
5
like
section
6,
therefore,
is
an
extreme
example
of
the
imputation
of
guilt
from
associations.
it
established
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
every
member
of
the
communist
party
merely
because
of
the
fact
of
his
membership
is
likely
to
endanger
the
national
defense
every
time
he
has
given
access
to
a
defense
facility,
to
the
premises
of
the
defense
facility.
this
presumption
is
invalid
because
as
aptheker
stated
and
again
i
quote,
“it
is
supported
only
by
a
tenuous
relationship
between
the
bare
fact
or
organizational
membership
and
the
activity
congress
sought
to
prescribe.”
furthermore,
as
in
the
case
of
section
6,
congress
could
have
accomplished
it's
objectives
by
less
drastic
because
more
discriminating
means.
these
are
exemplified,
these
means,
in
the
first
place
by
the
industrial
security
program
that
mr.
maroney
mentioned
a
program
administered
by
the
department
of
defense
and
presently
applicable
to
the
employees
of
the
defense
contractors.
congress
could
of
course,
very
readily
have
extended
it,
if
it
wanted
too,
to
all
employees
of
defense
facilities.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
they
could
not
because
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chief
justice,
no
they
could
not
because
i'm
just
going
to
say
in
a
moment
that
program
is
less
drastic
and
more
discriminating
that
this
statute.
but
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
one
moment.
this
industrial
security
program
and
its
predecessors
date
back
to
world
war
ii
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
and
mr.
maroney
said
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
program
hasn't
proved
entirely
adequate
as
an
internal
security
measure.
the
program
is
less
drastic
than
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
in
two
respects.
first,
it
makes
membership
in
a
communist
organization,
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
all
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
determining
whether
an
employee
is
a
security
risk.
and
second,
persons
are
denied
security
--
who
are
denied
security
clearance,
aren't
barred
from
all
employment
in
the
plant,
they
are
only
barred,
from
access
to
classified
information
and
to
jobs
of
course,
which
require
such
access.
this
approach
reflects
the
common
sense
view
that
there
is
no
danger
in
applying
a
security
risk
in
a
job
that's
completely
insensitive.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
conceivable
but
anybody
can
--
i
suppose,
could
disrupt
the
activities
of
any
employee,
of
the
immediate
job
that
he's
on
by
some
kind
of
conduct.
but
as
mr.
maroney
told
us,
he's
fired,
removed
from
these
--
from
a
sensitive
work
that's
going
out
in
the
plant.
he
doesn't
have
access
to
the
parts
of
the
shipyard
where
they're
building
destroyers
or
engaging
in
other
sensitive
activity.
and
it's
hard
to
conceived
what
he
could
do
that
would
be
disruptive.
and
i
call
your
attention
mr.
justice
fortas
to
cole
versus
young
in
which
the
court,
because
of
this
consideration,
interpreted
the
security
statute
--
or
not
the
security
statute,
in
that
case
with
the
president's
executive
order,
as
applying
only
to
security
sensitive
jobs.
the
1957
report
of
the
commission
on
government
security,
similarly
to
the
industrial
security
program,
opposed
the
exclusion
of
security
risks
from
non-sensitive
employment,
labeling
such
a
measure,
and
i
quote,
“objectionable
and
unnecessary.”
the
same
report
also
recommended
that
in
determining
the
significance
for
security
purposes
of
membership
in
a
communist
organization,
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
factors
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
the
member's
own
intent
in
joining
it
and
the
degree
of
his
participation
in
its
activities,
factors
which
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
we
don't
--
we
don't
argue
in
terms
of
excessive
congressional
delegation
mr.
justice
brennan
because
this
court
has
approved
some
pretty
broad
delegations.
we
do
argue
it
in
terms
of
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
have
thought
so
before
i've
read
some
of
your
decisions
in
which
you've
authorized
some
awfully
broad
delegation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
schechter
is
kind
old
fashioned
these
days,
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
still
of
the
books,
we
might
well
have
argue
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
are
about
four
constitutional
questions
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case,
no
doubt
about
it.
but
i
think
this
case
is
ended
by
aptheker
before
you
reach
this
sticky
a
question
as
a
delegation
question.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
the
constitutional
questions
i'm
now
arguing,
that
is
to
say
the
unreasonable
and
from
substantive
due
process
point
of
view.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
with
the
--
except
in
the
decision
that
the
court
rendered,
obviously.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
can't
cite
the
cases
to
you
offhand.
i
can't
cite
all
of
the
cases
to
you
offhand,
justice
black
but
my
--
our
research
brought
us
to
the
conclusion
that
delegation
substantially
has
brought
us
the
delegation
of
power
in
this
case
had
been
improved
by
the
court
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
perhaps.
in
any
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
your
views
on
delegation
adhere
much
more
closely
to
schechter
than
that
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
court.
again,
while
the
act
was
in
debate
--
it
is
being
debated
in
the
congress,
the
department
of
justice
as
mr.
maroney
has
indicated,
to
the
position
that
--
or
opposed
rather
a
proposal
to
bar
persons
from
federal
employment
solely
in
the
basis
of
their
organizational
membership.
now,
he
stated
and
answered
i
think
to
a
question
from
the
chief
justice
that
this
statute
cures
the
objection
that
the
department
then
found
to
that
statute.
of
course,
this
statute
doesn't
cure
the
department's
objection,
the
department
changed
its
position.
the
letter
from
the
department
to
the
committee
of
congress
which
was
considering
that
measure
is
quoted
at
page
513
of
the
aptheker
case
and
here's
what
acting
attorney
general
ford
said
to
that
bill.
“the
bill
would
brand
the
member
of
a
listed
organization
a
felon,
no
matter
how
innocent
his
membership;
the
loyalty
program
enables
the
member
to
respond
to
charges
against
him
and
to
show,
in
a
manner
consistent
with
american
concepts
of
fairness
and
justice,
that
his
membership
is
innocent
and
does
not
reflect
on
his
loyalty."
now
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
a
showing
that
this
statute
denies
to
robel
in
this
case.
there
is
no
substance
to
the
government's
attempts
to
distinguish
this
case
from
aptheker
and
let
me
address
myself
to
the
distinctions
that
the
government
urges
in
its
brief,
since
mr.
maroney
spoke
only
very
briefly
on
the
question
during
his
portion
of
the
argument.
first,
the
government
says
that
section
6
is
broader
than
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d),
the
section
were
dealing
with
here
because
section
6
supplies
to
communist-fund
organizations
while
this
section
applies
only
to
member
of
communist-action
organization.
but
aptheker,
invalidated
section
6
as
applied
to
members
of
the
communist
party
and
to
leading
members
of
the
communist
party
or
persons
characterized
as
top-ranking
party
leaders
at
that.
second,
the
government
says
that
the
right
to
travel
is
more
basic
than
the
right
to
work.
this
belies
what
it
said
in
its
brief
in
aptheker
case
that
the
denial
of
passports
and
i
quote
“is
a
considerably
milder
disability
than
the
loss
of
employment.”
of
course
both
rights
are
basic.section
5
and
section
6
are,
and
they
were
intended
to
be
complementary
and
together
to
make
life
intolerable
for
communists.
as
justice
black
put
it
in
his
dissent
in
the
party
registration
case
and
i
quote,
“the
act
makes
it
extremely
difficult
for
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
live
in
this
country
and
at
the
same
time,
makes
it
a
crime
for
him
to
try
and
get
a
passport
to
get
out”.
furthermore,
this
court
in
wieman
versus
updegraff
and
on
the
last
term
in
elfbrandt
versus
russell,
applied
the
rule
invoked
in
aptheker
to
invalidate
a
statute
making
membership
in
a
communist
organization,
a
disqualification
for
employment.
the
arizona
statute
involved
in
elfbrandt
was
narrower
than
section
5
because
it
at
least
applied
only
to
members
having
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
purpose
of
the
organization.
the
court
nevertheless
invalidated
the
statute
because
it
reached
members
who
did
not
themselves
subscribed
to
this
unlawful
purpose
or
engaged
in
unlawful
organizational
activities.
the
government
says
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
elfbrandt
because
elfbrandt
involves
state
employment
and
less
grave
public
interest
or
a
more
grave
public
interest
is
at
stake
here
in
the
case
of
defense
facility
employment.
but
certainly,
some
jobs
in
state
governments,
to
which
section
5
applies
are
more
security
sensitive
than
many
of
the
non-sensitive
jobs
to
which
this
statute
applies.
to
give
you
only
one
example,
only
last
week,
up
in
new
york,
a
member
of
the
new
york
state
police
who
was
a
minuteman
was
arrested,
a
minuteman
who
used
his
job
in
the
new
york
state
police
to
filter
all
arsenal
weapons
for
the
use
of
the
minuteman.
elfbrandt
invalidated
the
arizona
statute
as
to
all
state
employment,
sensitive
or
non-sensitive.
because
as
it's
stated
at
page
17
and
i
quote,
“those
who
join
an
organization
but
do
not
share
its
unlawful
purposes
and
who
do
not
participate
in
its
unlawful
activities,
surely
pose
no
threat
either
as
citizens
or
public
employees.”
such
persons
surely
pose
no
threat,
these
elfbrandt
words
as
defense
employees
either.
next,
the
government
argues
that
congress
had
no
less
drastic
means
available
than
the
means
used
in
section
5.
says,
that
are
being
impractical
to
apply
the
screening
technique
of
the
industrial
security
program
to
defense
facilities
in
view
of
the
greater
number
of
employees
involved.
but
--
and
here's
where
the
three
million
figure
came
from
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
way
back
as
of
1956,
10
years
ago,
they
had
already
screened
three
million
employees
under
the
industrial
security
program.
and
mr.
maroney
said
here
this
morning
that
he
was
advised
that
the
defense
facilities
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense
involved
only
about
1%
of
total
employment
in
the
united
states.
well,
if
you
take
the
total
figure
of
70
million
that
would
give
us
seven
million
employees
of
defense
facilities
of
whom
three
million
had
already
been
screened
way
back
in
1956.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
at
one
point
in
his
argument
mr.
justice
brennan,
he
did
said
that
1%
of
the
number
of
facilities.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
him
whether
wasn't
it
true
that
there
were
great
many
more
employees
involved,
and
mr.
maroney
said,
“no,
i
think
not.
i've
been
advised
by
some
of
the
defense
department
that
the
ratio
is
about
the
same”.
besides
which
if
practicality
is
a
consideration,
a
more
impractical
measure
than
section
5
would
be
hard
to
imagine.
here
it
is,
16
years
after
the
act
was
passed
and
section
5
hasn't
yet
even
got
off
the
ground.
if
our
security
depended
on
its
effectiveness,
we
would
in
pretty
bad
shape
here
16
years
after
the
act
was
passed.
finally
the
government
says
that
the
aptheker
was
distinguishable
because
there
is
less
risk
in
permitting
communists
to
venture
abroad
than
in
allowing
them
access
to
a
defense
facility.
this
argument
conveniently
overlooks
a
lured
picture
of
the
travel
menace
that
the
government
painted
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
in
the
aptheker
case.
but
more
to
the
point,
the
government
can't
cite
a
single
instance
in
which
a
communist
employee
of
a
defense
facility
was
even
suspected
of
espionage
or
sabotage
during
the
whole
16
years
that
the
act
has
been
on
the
books.
and
the
only
instance
it
cites
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
is
based
on
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
and
as
our
brief
shows
has
since
been
completely
discredited.
the
government
also
relies
on
the
findings
of
congress
in
section
2
of
the
act
that
communist-action
organizations
seek
to
accomplish
their
ultimate
political
objective
by
espionage,
sabotage,
and
other
unlawful
means.
but
this
finding
is
contradicted
by
the
report
of
a
board
which
your
company
that's
ordered,
that's
the
communist
party
register
under
the
act.
the
report
reviewed
the
party's
activities
at
great
length
for
the
full
period
from
its
organization
in
1919
to
1952.
it
found
by
way
of
conclusion
that
the
party
operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
world
communist
movement
but
it
doesn't
find
a
single
instance
of
espionage,
sabotage
or
the
use
of
any
other
unlawful
means
in
this
entire
period
under
review
and
the
report
says
there
of
any
findings
of
unlawful
party
advocacy
as
it
is
of
a
finding
of
any
other
unlawful
activity.
at
most,
the
board
found
that
the
party
advocated
violence
only
as
a
abstract
and
therefore
protected
political
doctrine
and
this
court
so
viewed
the
findings
in
its
1961
decision
upholding
the
registration
order.
the
decisions
in
the
aptheker
and
wieman
cases
teach
that
the
scienter
required
to
disqualify
a
person
from
employment
or
travel
because
of
membership
in
a
communist
organization
has
actual
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
an
unlawful
purpose.
mere
knowledge
of
the
organization
has
been
officially
condemned
as
insufficient
for
this
purpose.
but
even
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
a
member's
knowledge
of
the
registration
ordered
against
the
communist
party
couldn't
supply
the
necessary
scienter
since
the
order
was
not
accompanied
by
any
finding
of
any
unlawful
party
purpose
of
party
activity.
a
majority
of
the
court
in
the
1961
case
held
that
such
a
finding
of
unlawful
purpose
or
activity
wasn't
essential
to
the
validity
of
the
registration
order
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
it
in
his
opinion,
registration
is
a
regulatory
rather
than
a
prohibitory
statute.
we
disagree
with
that
view
for
the
reasons
that
chief
justice
stated
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
but
however
that
maybe,
the
section
we
have
here
today,
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
is
clearly
prohibitory.
as
a
result
under
the
logic
of
your
1961
decision,
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
are
insufficient
to
support
the
application
of
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
to
members
of
the
party.
both
the
findings
of
the
board
and
the
showing
of
the
government
is
made
in
this
case
demonstrate
that
the
deprivation
of
liberty
imposed
by
section
5
of
the
act
has
no
real,
rational,
reasonable
relation
to
the
national
security.
simply
another
manifestation
of
what
senator
fullbright
has
characterized
and
i
quote
“as
our
morbid
preoccupation
with
the
danger
of
communist
subversion,
a
disease
which
has
proved
so
costly
to
our
personal
freedom
and
perhaps
more
important
to
our
national
dignity.”
the
lack
of
any
rational
basis
for
the
statute
leads
the
government
in
its
brief
to
justify
it
as
a
war
measure
and
to
dismiss
the
lack
of
any
declaration
of
war
against
the
soviet
union
as
a
mere
technicality.
after
reading
the
president's
recent
speeches
on
the
necessity
of
improving
soviet-american
relations,
i
can
only
conclude
that
there
has
been
breakdown
in
communications
between
the
white
house
and
the
department
of
justice,
on
this
phase
of
the
case
and
one
wonders
what
might
not
have
been
wiser
to
appoint
it
under
secretary
of
state
as
attorney
general
rather
than
to
have
made
the
attorney
general
under
secretary
of
the
state.
mr.

j.

the
picking

i

mr.

abt
well,
i
don't

no
application

mr.
john
j.
abt
i
certainly
would,
yes,
on
the
basis
of
mere
members
in
the
organization
everything
that
i've
said
about
the
statute
applies
irrespective
of
the
nature
of
the
organization.
we
got
to
prove
something
more
than
organizational
membership,
that's
what
you
said
in
wieman,
that's
what
you
said
in
aptheker,
that's
what
you
said
in
elfbrandt.
i
turn
now
to
the
first
amendment.
by
punishing
members
of
a
radical
or
political
minority
for
engaging
in
specified
private
employment,
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
restrains
the
freedom
of
political
association
which
the
first
amendment
protects.
the
validity
of
the
section
must
therefore
be
judged
by
first
amendment
standards.
the
applicable
standard
is
that
the
legislation
must
be
narrowly
drawn
so
as
not
in
the
words
of
scales
versus
united
states
and
i
quote
“to
cut
deeper
into
the
freedom
of
association
and
as
necessary
to
deal
with
the
substance
of
evils
that
the
congress
has
a
right
to
prevent.
both
the
blunderbuss
impacts
of
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
on
its
face
and
its
application
to
members
of
the
communist
party,
an
organization
which
has
not
been
found
to
engage
in
unlawful
activity
invalidates
the
section
under
this
standard.
the
government's
brief
argues
that
congress
was
justified
in
enacting
the
section
in
preference
to
a
narrowly
drawn
screening
program
because
you
and
i
quote,
“it
has
an
immediate
interim
effect
and
requires
no
bulky
administrative
machinery
to
carry
it
into
practice.”
but
as
this
court
has
so
often
held
considerations
of
administrative
convenience
and
efficiency
that
might
be
persuasive
in
other
context
can
never
justify
the
infringement
of
first
amendment
freedoms.
and
the
interim
effect
of
the
section,
a
feature
which
the
government
seems
to
believe
to
be
so
desirable
and
advantageous
is
enough
alone
to
invalidate
the
section
because
as
this
court
has
said
and
i
think
it
was
in
naacp
versus
button.
these
are
--
these
first
amendment
freedoms
are
delicate
and
vulnerable
and
the
fact
of
sanctions
is
often
sufficient
to
inhibit
their
exercise
even
if
the
sanctions
are
not
applied.
the
statute's
chilling
effect
on
the
first
amendment
freedoms
of
all
americans,
communists
and
non-communist
was
depicted
by
president
truman
in
his
veto
message
in
which
he
said
after
reviewing
the
effect
of
a
statute,
the
inevitable
--
and
i
quote,
“the
inevitable
tendency
would
be
to
express
null
obvious
uncontroversial
subjects.”
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
three
questions
which
haven't
been
touched
on
the
government's
brief
and
only
one
of
which
was
touched
on
in
request
of
mr.
maroney's
argument.
the
first
of
these
involves
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
that
the
indictment
is
defective
because
it
alleges
only
if
the
communist
party
has
been
ordered
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization
but
not
that
the
communist
party
is
in
fact
such
an
organization.
and
i
think
mr.
maroney
inadvertently
misdescribed
the
indictment
when
i
was
opening
remarks
and
said
the
indictment
charges
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization.
there
is
no
such
allegation.
the
only
allegation
is
that
it's
been
harder
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
his
latter
allegation
that
is
to
say
the
fact,
the
allegation
that
the
party
is
a
communist-action
organization
was
omitted
because
the
government
interpret
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
as
making
the
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
conclusive
as
to
its
character
for
the
purposes
of
a
prosecution
under
the
section.
this
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
the
introductory
clause
of
section
5
provides,
and
i
quote,
“when
a
communist
organization”
and
i
interject
to
say
that
means
under
the
statute
either
a
communist
action
or
a
communist
front
organization,
“when
a
communist
organization
is
registered
or
there
is
in
effect
a
final
order
requiring
such
organization
to
register
then
it
becomes
unlawful
for
the
members
to
do
certain
things.”
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d),
the
subsection
of
that
section
which
is
immediately
involved
here
provides
and
i
quote,
“if
such
organization
referring
back
to
a
communist
action
or
communist
fund
organization
that
has
been
ordered
to
register.
if
such
organization
is
a
communist-action
organization
then
it
is
unlawful
for
the
members
to
hold
defense
facility
employment.
i
think
it's
clear
from
this
wording
that
section
5
is
applicable
to
the
members
of
an
organization
which
both
is
a
communist
organization
or
in
the
case
of
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d),
a
communist-action
organization
and
which
is
either
registered
or
been
ordered
to
register
as
such
an
organization.
in
other
words,
congress
in
this
section
made
the
existence
of
the
fact
and
not
only
of
the
board's
finding
as
to
the
fact
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
wording
of
other
criminal
provisions
of
the
act
cited
in
our
brief
showed
that
this
result
was
deliberate.
or
one
of
them
unlike
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
and
section
6
(a)
makes
the
fact
as
well
as
the
findings
an
element
of
the
offense.
others
like
section
6
(b)
of
the
act,
section
10,
section
15
(a)
clearly
predicates
the
criminal
liability
only
on
the
existence
of
a
registration
order
and
the
finding
by
the
board
that
the
organization
is
that
a
communist
organization
and
not
on
its
actual
character.
the
construction
of
section
5
in
accordance
with
its
text
as
i've
indicated
it
is
required
by
the
rule
of
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes
and
as
compelled,
we
think
by
three
constitutional
considerations
that
i'd
like
to
indicate
very
briefly
here.
first,
the
government's
construction
of
the
section
denies
appellee
procedural
due
process
because
it
precludes
him
from
challenging
in
the
criminal
proceedings
the
validity
of
the
board's
1953
determination
that
the
communist
party
was
a
communist-action
organization,
a
determination
made
in
a
proceeding
to
which
it
was
not
a
party.
moreover,
even
if
it
could
be
said
that
the
appellee
is
bound
by
the
board's
determination
taken
in
his
absence
could
still
be
entitled
to
litigate
the
current
character
of
the
organization
or
the
current
validity
of
the
board's
determination
which
is
now
13
years
old
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
1961
case
is
based
on
evidence
that's
far
more
than
13
years
old.
we
--
our
position
is
that
the
appellee
is
not
accorded
due
process
by
section
13
of
the
act
which
permits
a
registered
organization
to
apply
periodically
to
the
board
for
a
redetermination
of
the
status.
in
the
first
place,
this
procedural
is
available
only
to
organizations
and
not
to
individuals.
therefore,
it's
not
available
to
the
appellee.
furthermore,
it's
not
available
to
the
communist
party.
because
under
section
13,
an
organization
must
first
register
in
a
communist-action
organization
before
it
can
apply
to
the
board
for
a
redetermination
of
its
status.
now,
the
communist
party
hasn't
registered
under
the
act.
it's
still
litigating
the
constitutionality
of
enforcement
of
that
provision
against
it
under
the
questions
that
are
litigating
the
questions
which
is
quite
held
premature
in
the
1961
case.
obviously,
it's
got
a
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
have
those
questions
determined
and
the
appellee
can't
be
denied
these
constitutional
rights
because
the
communist
party
is
asserting
its
own.
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
section
would
also
invalidate
it
as
a
bill
of
attainder.
in
the
1961
case,
a
majority
of
the
court
held
that
the
act's
registration
requirement
didn't
obtain
the
organization.
this
conclusion
was
based
on
the
few
that
section
13
would
permit
the
party
to
secure
a
periodically
determination
of
its
status
and
hence
that
observance
of
the
obligations,
have
registration
and
impales
is
made
to
turn
on
what
the
court
in
its
opinion
called
and
i
quote,
“continuously
contemporaneous
fact
in
this
effect.”
but
as
i
have
shown
the
party
can't
secure
a
redetermination
of
its
status
so
long
as
it
resists
the
effort
to
enforce
the
registration
requirement
against
it.
nor
paradoxically
will
that
ever
be
able
to
secure
a
redetermination
of
it's
status,
if
it's
successful
in
the
pending
litigation
and
the
registration
order
is
found
to
be
constitutionally
unenforceable.
in
any
event,
a
section
13
proceeding
isn't
available
to
the
appellee.
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute
therefore
which
doesn't
give
the
appellee
to
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
determination
on
the
criminal
trial,
he
has
no
possible
escape
from
the
effect
of
a
board's
determination
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization
even
if
that
determination
no
longer
has
any
validity.
his
position
that
is
the
appellee's
position
today
is
exactly
the
same
as
all
of
the
communist
party
has
been
named
in
the
act.
the
board's
determination
that
the
communist
party
isn't
a
communist-action
organization,
it
has
that
effect
as
to
him
and
that
being
so
the
statute
as
the
government
would
interpret
is
invalid
under
the
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
brown.
the
final
constitutional
difficulty
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
section
entails
is
that
it
deprives
the
appellee
of
the
rights
of
indictment
by
grand
jury,
a
trial
by
petty
jury
and
proof
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
so
because
section
5
can't
be
constitutionally
applied
to
him
unless
at
least
the
communist
party
is
of
characteristics
which
the
act
attributes
to
a
communist-action
organization.
yet
under
the
government's
construction
of
statute
this
issue
affect
was
withdrawn
from
the
grand
jury
that
returns
the
indictment
and
the
petty
jury
that
deprives
the
case
and
is
confided
to
an
administrative
agency,
the
subversive
activities
control
board
which
moreover
is
told
to
make
its
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
not
on
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
if
this
procedure
were
permissible,
congress
could
frame
almost
any
offense
in
terms
that
would
provide
for
the
determination
of
essential
facts
by
an
administrative
agency
and
thus
bypass
the
jury
trial
of
the
most
controversial
factual
issues
on
which
criminal
liability
depends.
to
cite,
give
you
only
one
example,
congress
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
it's
a
crime
for
a
taxpayer
to
refuse
to
pay,
fail
to
pay
a
deficiency
which
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
has
determined
because
the
taxpayer
failed
to
report
income
which
he
earned
making
the
internal
revenue
services
determination
that
taxpayer
earn
income
and
failed
to
report
it
are
conclusive
for
the
purpose
of
(voice
overlap)
cases.
certainly
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
would
cure
of
the
particular
point
that
i'm
now
discussing
justice
fortas
because
we
no
longer
have
been
talking
about
a
criminal
statute.
it
wouldn't
cure
of
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
under
elfbrandt,
under
wieman,
under
aptheker,
that
the
state's
invalidity
which
resides
in
a
fact
that
statute
makes
a
the
bare
fact
of
membership
without
consideration
of
these
other
essential
elements,
a
disqualification
for
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
not
that
society
didn't
mean
what
it
says
but
that
the
member
didn't
endorse
the
use
of
the
society
when
it
became
a
member;
it
may
have
become
a
member
to
reformat,
it
may
have
become
a
member
because
the
fbi
send
them
in
there
as
a
(inaudible)
agent,
an
informant.
it
may
have
become
a
member
for
a
lot
of
different
purposes
and
you
can
wreck
my
view
by
changing
the
name
of
the
outcome
mr.
justice
fortas
because
there
is
something
much
more
essential
involved
here.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
every
case,
that's
what
the
court
held
in
the
twin
cases
of
scales
and
noto.
mr.
john
j.
abt
now,
you're
asking
me
a
very
easy
question.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
i
have
to
think
about
it
if
you
put
it
in
terms
of
a
civil
sanction.
i
still
think
my
first
reaction
would
be
yes.
under
elfbrandt,
under
wieman,
under
--
which
your
civil
cases,
which
involved
only
a
disqualification,
they're
not
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
john
j.
abt
best
answer
i
can
give
you
on
that
justice
fortas
is
what
the
court
of
the
commission
on
government
security
said
in
1957
and
they
would
know
that
as
fire
out
lifters
i
believe
as
i
recall
that
as
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
president
of
the
american
bar
association
that
was
a
tripartite
commission,
i
think
senator
eastland
former
chairman
of
the
un-american
activities
--
pardon
--
were
both
members
of
it
and
they
said
that
--
they
proposed
the
statute
--
a
model
statute
on
government
security
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
their
report.
and
that
statute
proposal
provides
that
mere
membership
in
the
organization
is
not
sufficient
that
the
body
considering
the
security
question
must
consider
the
purpose
that
the
member
had
in
joining
it,
his
actual
knowledge
of
the
purpose
of
the
organization
and
the
degree
of
his
participation
in
these
activities.
and
i
go
along
with
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
i
would.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
a
kind
of
a
security
system
that
we've
had
during
and
ever
since
world
war
ii
with
reference
to
defense
contractors
in
the
most
secret
jobs
there
are.
that
the
government,
the
industrial
security
programs
sets
up
a
screening
system.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
under
the
department
of
defense's
regulations,
mere
membership
is
not
disqualifying
for
security
clearance
in
the
access
to
the
most
secret
work.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
it
hasn't
been
a
question
of
litigation
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
merely,
on
the
basis
of
the
bare
effective
organizational
membership?
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
mere,
their
membership
isn't
enough.
you
got
to
show
something
more
about
the
individual,
personal
qualities
of
the
individual.
otherwise,
you're
--
this
is
pure
guilt
by
association
and
let
me
say
well,
a
man
is
a
fool
to
join
such
an
organization
that
he
doesn't
believe
in
it.
but
the
fact
that
the
man
is
a
fool
doesn't
make
him
a
security
risk.
the
government
says
that
if
they're
required
to
prove
the
character
of
this
organization
in
each
prosecution
under
section
5
that
section
5
would
be
unenforceable.
but
as
i
noted
in
answering
one
of
justice
fortas'
questions
that's
a
precisely
what
this
court
held
that
the
government
has
to
do
in
cases
under
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
in
its
decision
in
noto
versus
united
states.
besides
that,
you
have
section
5
is
unenforceable.
it
will
be
because
the
act
as
a
whole
was
unenforceable,
as
16
years
of
ruthless
litigation
should
by
this
time
pretty
well
have
established.
it's
unenforceable
because
it
attempts
to
do
the
impossible,
to
accomplish
an
unconstitutional
purpose,
the
outlawry
of
a
political
party
in
a
constitutional
manner.
any
congress
surprised
to
accomplish
this
is
bound
to
stumble.
the
statute
is
bound
to
be
unenforceable
either
because
it's
unworkable
or
because
it's
unconstitutional
or
both,
as
president
truman
held
or
stated
in
his
veto
message
was
the
case
with
this
statute.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
that's
the
next
point
that
i
was
going
to
simply
state.
we've
argued
it
in
our
brief.
we
didn't
make
the
delegation
point
that
you
raised
mr.
justice
douglas
--
justice
brennan.
we
do
say
that
there's
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
here
because
of
the
act
affords
no
hearing
whatsoever
that
the
person's
affected
before
a
defense
--
a
plant
is
declared
to
be
a
defense
facility
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's'
not
sufficient.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
we
argued
at
the
point
of
procedural
due
process
that
before
a
man's
hurt
by
a
designation,
he's
got
the
right
to
be
heard
as
to
the
validity
of
the
designation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
not
an
issue
of
the
trial.
and
the
indictment
doesn't
allege
that
the
plant
is
a
defense
facility
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
it
only
alleges
a
designation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
at
a
minimum.
i
think
even
that
would
be
insufficient
because
i
think
before
a
man's
indicted
for
working
in
a
defense
facility,
he's
got
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
designation
was
a
proper
one
or
not.
and
he
can't
have
that
hearing
only
in
connection
with
a
criminal
trial.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
a
risk
of
violating
a
statute
in
facing
a
criminal
trial
before
he
can
make
that
point.
my
final
point
deals
with
the
question
that
justice
fortas
raised.
we
say
that
the
section
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
because
the
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
has
been
invalidated
by
facts
of
which
this
court
can
and
should
take
judicial
notice
showing
at
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
doesn't
exist.
by
definition
there
can't
be
a
communist-action
organization
unless
there's
a
world
communist
movement
that
meets
the
section
2
description.
this
is
so
because
the
definition
of
a
communist-action
organization
is
tied
in
with
the
findings
of
section
2.
section
33
defines
a
communist-action
organization
as
an
organization
which
is
controlled
by
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
and
which
operates
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
movement
described
in
section
2.
section
2
finds
that
there
exists
a
world
communist
movement
made
up
of
communist-action
organizations
which
are
not
free
and
independent
but
are
national
sections
of
the
world
communist
movement
and
are
controlled
by
and
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
communist
dictatorship
of
an
unnamed
foreign
country.
the
board
found
that
this
country
was
the
soviet
union.
now
on
affirming
the
board's
order
against
the
communist
party,
the
court
in
its
1961
decision
held
that
the
characteristics
of
the
world
communist
movement
and
the
source
of
its
control
as
found
in
section
2
are
not
subject
to
proof
or
disproof
in
the
registration
proceedings.
it
regarded
the
finding
of
the
board
that
the
soviet
union
was
the
unnamed
foreign
power
referred
to
in
section
2
as
a
matter
of
law
-
question
of
law,
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
which
it
affirmed.
the
court
recognized
that
a
change
in
the
world
situation
would
invalidate
this
construction
and
that
the
time
might
come
when
in
its
words
and
i
quote,
“the
board
or
a
reviewing
court
will
be
able
to
say
that
the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
in
the
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.”
well,
as
mr.
justice
fortas's
question
implies,
the
future
world
situation
which
the
opinion
envisaged
has
materialized.
whatever
may
have
been
said
about
the
section
2
findings
in
1950
when
they
were
made,
the
description
of
communism
as
a
monolithic
world
movement
under
iron
soviet
control
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
all
free
governments
by
a
criminal
means
applies
in
the
face
of
the
facts
of
contemporary
political
life
as
everybody
knows.
yet
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated,
neither
the
appellee
nor
the
communist
party
can
secure
board
consideration
of
these
facts
nor
could
the
appellee
litigate
the
issue
in
this
criminal
trial
since
the
court
in
the
1961
case
held
the
issue
as
one
of
statutory
construction.
accordingly,
it's
incumbent
on
the
court,
this
court,
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
self-evident
fact
that
in
the
words
of
your
1961
decision,
“the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
to
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.”
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
of
course
not.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
defer
discussion
of
the
delegation
question
until
a
little
later
of
my
argument
and
start
with
the
due
process
--
substantive
due
process
first
amendment
question
that
the
case
presents.
section
5(a)(1)(d)
provides
that
upon
the
issuance
of
a
final
registration
order
requiring
a
communist-action
organization
to
register
under
the
act,
it
becomes
a
crime
for
a
member
of
the
organization
with
knowledge
or
notice
of
the
order
and
the
designation
to
hold
or
even
to
apply
for
employment
in
a
defense
facility,
and
let
me
say
that
what
notice'
or
knowledge'
means
under
this
statute
is
simply
this,
a
man
has
notice
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
by
virtue
of
its
publication
in
the
federal
register.
he
has
notice
of
the
designation
of
a
plant,
the
plant
in
which
he
works
or
which
he
applies
for
a
job
as
a
defense
facility
by
virtue
of
the
posting
in
the
plant
of
notices
of
a
fact
of
a
designation.
that's
all
the
notice'
and
knowledge'
mean
under
this
section
of
this
statute.
now,
the
indictment
here
charges
the
existence
of
a
final
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
ordering
it
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization,
the
designation
by
the
secretary
of
defense
of
the
seattle
division
of
todd
shipyards
as
a
defense
facility,
a
membership
by
robel
in
the
communist
party,
and
his
employment
at
todd's
with
knowledge
and
notice
of
both
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
and
of
the
designation
of
the
plant
as
a
defense
facility.
section
5
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
indictment
makes
robel
guilty
of
an
offense
even
though
he
does
not
know
that
the
communist
party
has
any
unlawful
purpose
of
any
kind
and
even
though
he
rejects
as
false
and
unwarranted
of
the
characterization
given
the
party
by
the
subversive
activities
control
board
as
a
soviet
agent
in
its
1953
registration
order.
it's
equally
irrelevant
to
robel's
guilt
under
the
statute
and
the
indictment
that
he
may
have
joined
the
party
and
remained
a
member
for
a
completely
legitimate
political
purpose
for
the
accomplishment
of
perfectly
lawful
political
objectives
and
that
his
activity
on
behalf
of
the
organization
has
been
lawful,
peaceable
and
constitutionally
protected.
thus,
although
section
5
parades
as
an
anti-espionage
and
anti-sabotage
law
as
written
and
applied,
it
reaches
members
of
the
communist
party
who
have
no
criminal
propensities,
whose
conduct
and
state
of
mind
are
completely
blameless
and
who
as
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief,
and
i
quote,
would
never
consider
committing
either
espionage
or
sabotage.
as
several
members
of
the
court
have
already
noted,
the
over
breadth
of
the
statute
is
exemplified
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
when
he
was
indicted
in
1953,
the
district
judge
found
that
robel
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
is
an
employee
of
the
todd
shipyards
for
upwards
of
ten
years.
mr.
john
j.
abt
1963,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
but
he
had
at
that
time
been
employed
at
least
since
1953.
following
his
arrest,
he
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance
and
promptly
returned
to
his
job
where
he's
working
to
this
very
day
obviously
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
concerned.
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
if
the
government
had
wanted
to
--
thought
he
was
a
security
risk
and
wanted
him
fired,
he's
got
plenty
of
leverage
to
use
against
the
todd
shipyards
to
get
him
fired.
if
the
todd
shipyards
saw
that
he
was
a
security
risk
in
the
job
where
he's
working
at
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
withdraw
the
attribution
to
you,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
was
an
error,
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
--
and
i'm
not
suggesting
any
improper
leverage
that
if
the
government
thought
that
he
was
a
security
risk
in
the
job
that
he
held,
he
would
no
longer
be
holding
that
job.
mr.
john
j.
abt
if
he
was
working
on
classified
work,
your
honor,
or
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
certainly,
if
todd
shipyards
thought
that
he
was
a
security
risk
and
was
about
to
or
threatened
or
there
was
any
danger
of
the
sabotage
or
espionage
on
his
part
that
todd's
would
have
found
a
way
to
fire
him
and
that
could
have
done
very
easily.
mr.
john
j.
abt
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they're
perfectly
free
to
do
so,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there's
a
union
contract.
and
there
might
possibly
be
a
grievance
under
the
union
contract.
but
if
they
can
establish
that
the
man
is
a
security
risk,
i'm
sure
that
the
union
is
not
going
to
defend
his
right
to
that
job.
and
there's
been
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
shipyard
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
take
it
that
they're
very
--
that
they're
very
delighted
to
have
a
first-class
machinist
on
the
job.
machinists
are
hard
to
come
by
these
days.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
is
not
much
to
remind
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
america
would
be
a
safer
place
to
live
in
if
this
man
were
sent
to
jail
and
thereby
deprived
of
both
of
his
liberty
and
of
the
job
that
he's
held
for
upwards
of
15
years.
when
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
case
was
made
in
the
district
court,
the
court
held
the
motion
in
advance
pending
the
decision
by
this
court
of
the
aptheker
case
and
they
didn't
hand
down
the
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
about
a
year
awaiting
your
decision
on
aptheker.
when
aptheker
came
down,
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
indictment.
he
recognized
that
section
5
in
the
light
of
aptheker,
scales
and
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
archie
brown
versus
united
states
would
violate
the
first
amendment
and
due
process
as
an
indiscriminate
and
overbroad
restraint
on
protected
freedoms
unless
the
elements
of
knowledge
by
the
accused
that
the
communist
party
has
an
unlawful
purpose,
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
accused
to
effectuate
that
purpose
and
some
kind
of
activity
toward
that
end
could
be
read
into
the
statute
by
interpretation.
he
therefore
sought
to
save
the
statute
by
reading
these
elements
into
it
and
dismissed
the
indictment
for
failing
to
allege
him.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
section
5
doesn't
bear
the
interpretation
that
the
district
court
placed
on
it
not
because
it
would
make
the
act
a
nullity
but
because
it
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
aptheker
case
where
the
identical
question
of
interpretation
was
presented
under
section
6
of
the
act,
the
passport
prohibition
of
the
act,
and
the
decision
there
that
section
6
can't
be
rewritten
to
supply
the
missing
elements
we
think
is
applicable
with
equal
force
to
section
5.
without
these
elements,
section
5
violates
due
process
and
the
first
amendment
by
placing
overbroad
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
restraints
both
upon
the
liberty
of
an
individual
to
hold
private
employment
protected
by
due
process
and
upon
his
freedom
of
association
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
say
not
under
your
decisions,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
i'm
coming
to
them
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may.
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
section
under
both
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
is
established
by
the
decision
in
aptheker,
by
elfbrandt
versus
russell
and
by
keyishian
versus
the
board
of
regents,
the
latter
case
decided
only
last
term
after
this
case
was
first
argued.
aptheker
invalidated
section
6
of
the
act
for
making
it
a
crime
for
a
member
of
an
organization
against
which
a
final
registration
order
has
been
issued
to
apply
for
or
use
a
passport.
elfbrandt
struck
down
an
arizona
statute
denying
public
employment
to
members
of
the
communist
party
with
notice
that
the
party
had
an
unlawful
purpose
--
and
with
knowledge,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
sorry,
that
the
party
had
an
unlawful
purpose.
and
keyishian
invalidated
a
complex
of
new
york
statutes
whose
effect
was
to
make
membership
in
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
that
an
advocated
forcible
overthrow
a
bar
to
public
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
they
did
not
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
think
--
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
it
makes
the
material
different,
sir.
the
army
is
the
most
extreme
and
perhaps
an
arguable
case,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
certainly,
the
right
to
employment
in
peace
time
seems
to
me
is
squarely
within
these
cases,
certainly
squarely
within
the
cases
that
relate
to
state
employment.
a
state
employment
can
be
at
least
as
sensitive
and
many
cases
more
sensitive
than
employment
of
the
sort
that
--
that
robel
is
engaged
in.
i
can
get
you
to
think
of
all
kinds
of
cases,
membership
or
an
employee
of
the
public
service
commission
who
have
access
to
all
the
public
utilities
in
the
state,
member
of
the
state
police
force,
and
none
of
these
cases,
neither
keyishian
nor
elfbrandt
is
qualified
at
all
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
job.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
right.
and
i
think
under
those
three
cases,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
congress
didn't
have
the
power
to
pass
it
and
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
want
to
come
to
that
a
little
later,
but
first
on
the
power
to
pass
it,
that
is
to
say
on
the
substantive
due
process
and
first
amendment
questions,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
concluded
by
the
principle
stated
in
keyishian,
which
summarized
or
capsulized
the
decisions
in
all
three
cases,
aptheker,
elfbrandt
and
keyishian,
and
it's
very
brief
i
want
to
read
it,
?legislation
which
sanctions
membership
unaccompanied
by
specific
intent
to
further
the
unlawful
goals
of
the
organization
or
which
is
not
active
membership
violates
constitutional
limitations.
and
since
the
employment
sanction
of
section
5
is
imposed
on
a
member
completely
without
regard
to
his
intent
or
his
activity,
it
violates
that
principle.
indeed,
the
case
for
the
application
of
the
principle
is
stronger
here
than
in
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
for
they
dealt
not
with
private
but
with
public
employment
in
which
the
government
has
a
proprietary
as
well
as
a
security
interest.
and
the
statutes
they
invalidated
impose
civil
sanctions
only
while
here,
we
have
a
criminal
statute.
moreover,
section
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yeah,
but
the
new
york
statute,
it
went
far
beyond
teaching.
it
went
to
every
form
of
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
keyishian
as
i
read
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
involved
the
section
of
the
new
york
statute
which
made
it
a
disqualification
for
public
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
that
particular
case,
but
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
as
i
read
your
opinion,
you
struck
down
a
statute
which
disqualified
--
it
was
disqualification
for
any
kind
of
public
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i
could
give
you
cases
--
both
ways
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
think
that
can
be.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
posed
the
case
of
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
which
i
suppose
is
the
most
extreme
case.
i'd
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
principle
that
you
set
forth
in
keyishian
is
applicable
there,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
today
because
we're
not
talking
about
the
army.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
but
both
keyishian
and
elfbrandt
related
to
every
sort
of
state
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
elfbrandt
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
included
such
employees.
mr.
john
j.
abt
additionally,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
statute
in
this
case
goes
far
beyond
the
statutes
in
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
because
it
sanctions
membership
even
though
the
member
has
no
knowledge
of
any
unlawful
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
organization.
indeed,
it
sanctions
membership
even
though
the
organization
has
no
unlawful
purpose
and
that
happens
to
be
the
situation
in
this
case.
they're
a
part
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
that
a
company
in
its
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
reviewed
the
history
of
the
party
from
its
organization
in
1919
to
1953
in
the
most
minute
detail.
it
found
that
the
party
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
world
communist
movement,
but
it
didn't
find
a
single
case,
single
instance
of
espionage,
sabotage
or
other
unlawful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
party
or
any
of
its
members
in
the
whole
period
under
review.
and
the
report
is
equally
bare
of
any
finding
of
unlawful
advocacy.
at
most,
it
found
that
the
party
advocated
forcible
overthrow
as
a
matter
of
abstract
and
hence
constitutionally
protected
doctrine,
and
this
court
so
viewed
the
findings
in
its
1961
decision
affirming
a
registration
order.
majority
held
that
a
finding
of
unlawful
acts
or
advocacy
was
not
a
constitutional
requisite
to
the
validity
of
the
order
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
his
opinion,
registration
is
a
regulatory,
not
a
prohibitory
measure.
we
disagree
with
this
conclusion
for
the
reasons
that
were
stated
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent.
but
whatever
the
case
with
registration,
section
5
is
clearly
a
prohibitory
criminal
statute.
accordingly
on
the
logic
of
the
majority
opinion
in
1961,
the
board's
findings
are
insufficient
to
support
the
application
of
section
5,
a
criminal
statute,
to
the
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
sweep
of
section
5
is
too
broad
and
indiscriminate
for
an
additional
reason.
it
applies
to
every
job
and
any
establishment
that's
been
designated
as
a
defense
facility
including
jobs
that
are
not
security
sensitive
and
from
which
there's
no
rational
reason
for
excluding
persons
even
though
they
may
conceivably
qualify
as
security
risks.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
section
were
to
provide
protection
against
espionage
and
sabotage
which
alleged
extensible
purpose,
this
could
have
been
accomplished
by
less
drastic,
more
discreet,
more
discriminating
means.
these
are
exemplified
first
of
all
by
the
industrial
security
program
to
which
mr.
maroney
referred
for
the
screening
of
employees
of
defense
contractors.
this
program
dates
all
the
way
back
to
world
war
ii
and
evidently
has
proved
to
be
an
adequate
and
satisfactory
security
measure.
mr.
maroney
says
that
this
statute
is
nothing
but
a
screening
program.
but
of
course,
it
is
not.
it's
much
more
drastic
and
less
discriminating
in
three
major
respects.
first,
the
industrial
screening
program
does
not
provide
that
membership
in
a
communist
organization
shall
be
disqualifying
per
se
but
makes
membership
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
all
the
others,
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
determining
whether
an
employee
is
a
security
risk.
secondly,
the
denial
of
security
clearance
is
not
a
bar
to
all
defense
employment
but
only
to
jobs
requiring
access
to
classified
information.
and
finally,
the
sanctions
of
the
program
are
civil
only,
exclusion
from
the
job
and
not
criminal
prosecution.
the
adequacy
of
the
approach
of
the
industrial
security
program
is
attested
by
the
fact
that
it
was
adopted
by
the
presidential
commission
in
government
security
in
legislation
that
recommended
in
1957
and
as
already
been
pointed
out
in
the
argument
by
the
department
of
justice
which
took
the
same
position
on
the
letter
to
congress
while
the
act
was
under
debate
and
by
president
truman
in
his
veto
message,
all
of
whom
call
the
a
blunder
breadth
approach
such
as
taken
by
section
5
ill-considered
objectionable
and
unnecessary.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
persons
who
have
access
to
classified
information,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
abt
of
course.
i'm
sorry,
broader
than
jobs
which
might
affect
the
security
of
united
states?
well,
certainly
as
applied
by
the
secretary,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
--
to
the
question
at
the
moment.
the
latter
is
much
broader
than
the
former.
robel
has
no
access
to
classified
information
and
yet,
section
5
has
been
made
applicable
to
him.
time
has
confirmed
the
accuracy
of
the
characterizations
of
both
the
commission
on
government
security,
the
department
of
justice
and
president
truman
in
his
veto
message.
it's
now
17
years
since
section
5
has
been
on
the
books
and
all
that
time,
it's
been
invoked
only
once
and
then
in
this
case
against
a
man
who
represents
no
danger
to
our
security
or
to
anything
else.
and
the
government
doesn't
and
can't
cite
a
single
case
of
espionage
or
sabotage
either
before
or
after
the
enactment
of
the
act
which
section
5
might
have
prevented
or
which
would
have
been
punishable
under
section
5.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
delegation
question
on
which
the
court
directed
argument.
it's
our
position
that
the
authority
given
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
the
enterprises
where
it
shall
be
a
crime
for
a
communist
to
hold
or
to
even
apply
for
employment
violates
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
the
violation
results
from
the
fact
that
congress
failed
to
specify
standards
or
to
provide
administrative
procedures
to
govern
the
exercise
of
the
secretary's
authority.
the
lack
of
standards
appears
first
from
section
3(7)
which
defines
the
term
facility'
so
broadly,
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
earlier
pointed
out
as
to
include
virtually
any
enterprise
that
employs
people.
section
5(b)
authorizes
the
secretary
to
make
the
employment
sanction
applicable
to
any
facility
simply
by
designating
it
as
a
defense
facility,
and
all
we
need
to
do
to
make
this
designation
is
to
find
that
it's
required
by
the
security
of
the
united
states.
the
act,
unlike
for
example
the
statute
under
consideration
in
yakus,
the
act
doesn't
specify
any
considerations
or
criteria
for
the
guidance
of
the
secretary
in
deciding
whether
or
not
he
can
make
a
finding
at
a
particular
facility
is
required
to
be
designated
by
the
security
of
the
united
states,
nor
can
any
guidelines
be
spelled
out
of
the
findings
of
section
2
of
the
act.
the
government
in
its
brief
pointed
to
the
recital
of
section
2(11)
of
the
act,
and
i
quoted,
the
agents
of
communism
have
devised
clever
and
ruthless
espionage
and
sabotage
tactics
which
are
carried
out
in
many
instances
and
form
or
manner
successfully
evasive
of
existing
law.
but
this
skip
of
congressional
hyperbole
tells
a
secretary
nothing
about
how
or
where
these
supposed
tactics
are
to
be
employed
and
that
therefore
supplies
the
secretary
with
no
criteria
for
administering
section
5(b).
the
fact
is
that
the
act
places
no
restraint
on
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
curtail
and
virtually
to
eliminate
the
employment
opportunities
open
to
communists
other
than
his
own
judgment
as
to
what
the
national
security
requires.
and
any
judgment
on
that
issue
is
a
policy
judgment
which
necessarily
turns
on
the
predilections
and
prejudices
of
the
particular
secretary
of
defense
who
happens
to
make
that
judgment.
hence,
facilities
need
to
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
national
defense
as
we
know
it.
if
some
secretary
of
defense
were
to
conclude
that
communists
are
a
menace
to
the
national
security
in
any
employment
they
hold,
he
has
the
authority
under
the
act
to
foreclose
them
from
practically
all
means
of
livelihood.
the
subjective
and
expansive
character
the
securities
concept
is
reflected
in
justice
jackson's
observation
in
the
knauff
case
and
i
quote,
security
is
like
liberty
in
that
many
are
the
crimes
that
are
committed
in
its
name.
but
section
1
article
1
at
least
makes
commission
of
such
crimes
prerogative
of
congress
and
precludes
it
from
licensing
at
administrative
agency
or
officer
to
commit.
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act's
delegation
is
established
by
panama
refining
versus
ryan
which
invalidated
the
section
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
authorizing
a
president
to
prohibit
the
interstate
transportation
of
oil
in
excess
of
state
--
withdrawn
in
excess
of
state
quotas.
the
court
found
nothing
in
this
statute
which
restricted
or
controlled
the
president
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
and
therefore
held
the
delegation
to
him
unconstitutional
because,
and
i
quote
from
the
decision,
it
gives
a
president
an
unlimited
authority
to
determine
the
policy
and
to
lay
down
the
prohibition
or
not
to
lay
it
down
as
he
may
see
fit.
the
secretary's
authority
to
lay
down
or
not
to
lay
down
the
prohibition
of
section
5(a)(1)(d)
is
similarly
unlimited.
to
hold
otherwise,
because
the
act
calls
for
a
finding
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
a
prohibition
would
reduce
compliance
of
article
1
section
1
to
the
pit
of
ceremonial
rhetoric.
the
unlimited
nature
of
the
secretary's
authority
also
appears
from
the
lack
of
any
requirement
that
he
states
the
facts
on
which
he
bases
his
finding.
the
act
does
not
require
him
to
account
for
or
explain
his
actions
in
any
way.
so
in
the
present
case,
nothing
in
the
indictment
or
elsewhere
on
the
record
indicates
why
robel's
place
of
employment
was
designated.
all
we
are
told
about
it
is
its
name.
mr.
maroney
says
that
its
name
shows
that
it's
a
shipyard.
but
in
this
day
of
the
conglomerate
merger,
the
todd
shipyards
corporation,
seattle
division
is
just
as
likely
to
be
a
manufacturer
of
cosmetics
or
a
publisher
of
comic
books,
as
a
builder
of
ships.
and
if
it
is
a
builder
of
ships,
a
builder
of
what
kind
of
ships?
nothing
in
the
indictment,
nothing
in
the
record
gives
us
the
answer.
the
lack
of
any
objective
standards
in
the
act
is
aggravated
also
by
the
denial
of
any
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
or
a
traditional
review
of
his
designations.
in
our
initial
brief
last
term,
we
showed
that
in
this
aspect,
the
act
violates
procedural
due
process.
i
think
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
any
kind
of
review
whatsoever
of
the
secretary's
determination.
but
even
if
that
were
to
become
possible
for
robel
to
secure
a
review
of
the
secretary's
determination
in
the
course
of
his
criminal
trial,
that
wouldn't
satisfy
constitutional
requirements.
under
the
yakus
case
and
other
decisions
of
this
court,
a
man
is
not
required
to
stake
his
liberty
as
a
price
of
testing
the
validity
of
an
administrative
determination.
he's
entitled
to
that
in
a
civil
suit
before
he
is
criminally
prosecuted.
so
i
say
the
absence
of
these
procedural
safeguards
as
we
showed
in
our
earlier
brief
is
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process.
but
is
also
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
delegation
to
the
secretary
oversteps
constitutional
limitations.
it
was
on
this
ground
for
example
the
absence
of
any
administrative
safeguards
that
the
court
in
the
schechter
case
distinguish
statutes
like
the
interstate
commerce,
federal
trade
commission
and
radio
commission
acts
from
the
code-making
provisions
of
the
nira
which
provided
for
no
administrative
safeguards
in
terms
of
hearings
and
judicial
review.
finally,
just
as
the
court
has
insisted
on
precision
of
regulation
in
statutes
that
infringed
basic
freedoms,
so
do
precision
as
required
in
delegations
of
authority
to
curtail
these
freedoms.
section
5
strikes
the
basic
freedoms
by
prohibiting
employment
to
persons
solely
because
of
their
political
association.
the
minimal
constitutional
requirement
i
suggest
of
such
a
statute
is
to
define
the
area
of
the
employments
that
may
be
prohibited
in
a
reasonably
specific
and
intelligible
fashion.
this
congress
has
not
done
it.
instead,
it
has
given
the
secretary
unfettered
authority
to
declare
almost
any
place
of
employment
off
limits
to
communists.
so
long
as
section
5
remains
on
the
statute
books,
every
member
of
the
communist
party,
no
matter
what
his
means
of
livelihood,
risks
waking
up
some
morning
to
discover
that
a
designation
by
the
secretary
has
subjected
him
to
a
possible
five-year
prison
sentence
merely
for
the
crime
of
reporting
to
work.
thus,
the
substance
of
over
breadth
of
section
5
that
i've
discussed
earlier
is
complimented
by
this
overbroad
delegation
of
authority.
each
accentuates
the
chilling
effect
of
the
other
on
freedom
of
association.
the
government
argues
that
any
initial
defect
in
the
delegation
to
the
secretary
was
secured
--
was
cured
by
the
1962
amendments
to
the
act
which
it
says
--
mr.
maroney
argued
a
few
moments
ago,
a
ratified
and
administrative
determination
interpretation
of
the
term
defense
facilities'
which
was
given
by
the
secretary
of
--
or
the
department
of
defense
in
hearing
some
of
the
amendments.
but
there
was
no
such
administrative
determination.
congress
was
merely
informed
that
the
defense
department
had
prepared
what
it
itself
described
as
a
tentative
list
of
the
facilities
to
be
designated,
which
of
course
was
not
binding
on
the
department
or
on
anybody
else.
and
there's
nothing
either
in
the
committee
hearings
or
reports
to
suggest
that
the
secretary
or
congress
regarded
this
tentative
list
as
delineating
the
categories
of
facilities
which
the
secretary
was
authorized
to
designate.
now,
mr.
maroney
in
his
argument
relied
i
take
it
heavily
if
not
almost
exclusively
on
the
decision
on
hirabayashi
to
sustain
the
delegation
in
this
case.
but
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
the
decision
in
that
case
in
retrospect,
i
submit
that
it's
perfectly
ridiculous
to
analogize
a
present
case
to
one
that
involved
the
wartime
authority
to
a
commanding
officer
to
cope
with
an
imminent
enemy
invasion
of
the
state
of
california.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
two
points
that
the
government
has
never
briefed
or
argued
in
this
case.
the
first
involves
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
that
the
indictment
is
defective
because
it
alleges
only
that
the
communist
party
has
been
ordered
to
register
as
a
communist
organization
but
not
that
the
party
is
in
fact
a
communist-action
organization.
the
government
omitted
the
latter
allegation
because
it
interprets
section
5
as
making
the
registration
order
against
the
party
conclusive
of
its
character
for
the
purpose
of
any
prosecutions
under
the
section.
this
interpretation
first
of
all
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
act.
the
introductory
clauses
both
of
section
5
and
of
section
5(a)(1)(d)
make
it
clear
that
they're
applicable
only
to
members
of
an
organization
which
both
is
a
communist-action
organization
and
which
has
been
ordered
to
register
as
such.
as
our
initial
brief
showed,
the
comparative
wording
of
other
sections
of
the
act
demonstrates
that
this
result
was
deliberate
on
the
part
of
congress
and
that
it
deliberately
required
proof
of
the
character
of
the
organization
in
the
criminal
proceeding
rather
than
making
the
finding
of
a
board
conclusive.
accordingly,
this
construction
of
section
5
is
required
both
by
the
rule
construction
of
the
criminal
statutes
and
is
also
required
by
three
constitutional
considerations
that
i'd
like
briefly
to
mention.
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
government's
construction
making
the
finding
of
a
board
conclusive
denies
appellee
procedural
due
process.
it
precludes
him
from
challenging
the
board's
1953
determination
that
the
communist
party
was
a
communist-action
organization
although
it
wasn't
a
party
to
the
proceeding
in
which
that
determination
was
made.
furthermore
and
perhaps
more
important,
it
precludes
him
from
challenging
the
current
validity
of
the
board's
determination
which
is
now
14
years
old
and
which
was
based
on
evidence
much
staler
than
that.
appellee
is
not
a
court
of
due
process
by
section
13
of
the
act
which
permits
a
registered
organization,
and
i
emphasize
both
words,
a
registered
organization,
to
make
periodic
application
to
the
board
for
a
re-determination
of
its
status
in
the
light
of
the
current
evidence.
this
procedure,
the
procedure
under
section
13
isn't
available
to
appellee
as
an
individual
since
it's
available
only
to
organizations
and
it
isn't
available
to
the
communist
party
which
has
not
registered
and
whose
refusal
to
register
has
now
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
communist
party
versus
united
states,
a
decision
which
the
government
has
accepted
holding
that
the
registration
order
against
the
party
is
hopelessly
at
odds
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
obviously,
appellee
can't
be
denied
his
constitutional
rights
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
board's
determination
because
the
officers
and
members
of
the
communist
party
have
elected
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights
not
to
register.
the
board's
--
the
government's
interpretation
also
makes
section
5
a
bill
of
attainder.
since
it
forecloses
appellee
from
litigating
the
current
character
or
the
current
validity
of
the
board's
1953
determination
against
the
party,
he
has
no
escape
from
the
effect
of
that
determination
upon
himself
even
though
the
determination
has
completely
lost
its
validity.
the
situation
under
the
government's
interpretation
would
be
the
same
as
though
the
communist
party
had
been
identified
by
name
in
the
statute
as
it
was
in
the
section
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
this
court
struck
down
in
united
states
versus
brown
on
the
grounds
of
the
bill
of
attainder.
the
third
constitutional
difficulty
with
the
government's
interpretation
is
that
it
deprives
appellee
of
the
rights
to
indictment
by
grand
jury,
trial
by
jury,
and
proof
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
so
because
section
5
may
not
constitutionally
be
enforced
unless
at
the
very
least
the
communist
party
has
the
characteristics
which
the
act
describes
to
a
communist-action
organization.
yet
under
the
government's
theory,
this
issue
of
fact
is
withdrawn
from
the
grand
jury
the
return
of
the
indictment,
from
the
petit
jury
that
were
prior
the
indictment,
and
to
top
it
off,
it
has
not
been
established
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
under
the
act
and
the
proceeding
before
the
board
only
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
surely,
this
court
which
has
recently
implemented
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused
in
so
many
other
situations
will
not
permit
three
of
his
most
basic
rights
to
be
circumvented
by
any
such
device.
the
last
point
i
will
argue
is
that
section
5
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
because
the
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
has
been
invalidated
by
facts
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
showing
that
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
of
the
act
does
not
exist.
the
communist
party
cannot
be
a
communist-action
organization
unless
there
is
a
world
communist
movement
that
meets
the
section
2
description.
this
is
so
because
section
3(3)
of
the
act
defines
a
communist-action
organization
as
an
agent
of
the
world
movement
described
in
section
2
and
obviously,
there
can
be
no
such
agent
if
there
is
no
principle.
section
2
describes
a
supposed
principle
as
a
worldwide
revolutionary
movement
not
led
by,
as
mr.
maroney
suggested
in
his
argument,
but
under
the
complete
direction,
domination,
control
and
discipline
of
the
communist
dictatorship
of
an
unnamed
foreign
power.
the
board
identified
this
power
in
1953
in
its
decision
as
a
soviet
union.
in
its
1961
decision
affirming
the
board's
order,
this
court
held
that
the
findings
of
section
2
concerning
the
nature
and
the
control
of
the
world
communist
movement
are
not
subject
to
proof
or
disproof
in
the
proceeding
before
the
board.
it
regarded
the
board's
identification
of
the
soviet
union
as
the
unnamed
foreign
power
referred
to
in
the
act
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
which
it
affirmed.
the
court
majority
opinion
recognized,
however,
that
future
events
might
invalidate
this
construction
and
that
the
time
might
come
when
in
the
words
of
the
opinion,
and
i
quote
them,
?the
board
or
a
reviewing
court
will
be
able
to
say
that
the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
the
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.
the
possibility
foreseen
by
the
court
is
now
materialized.
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
1950,
it's
common
knowledge
today
that
the
model
of
a
monolithic
world
communist
movement
under
soviet
control
bears
no
resemblance
to
contemporary
reality.
the
court
of
appeals
in
communist
party
versus
united
states
noted
this
fact.
it
pointed
out
that
the
soviet
union
can
only
regard
the
section
2
description
of
itself
as
a
bit
of
irony
and
that
the
assumptions
that
flow
from
such
a
description
have
long
since
been
discarded
as
a
basis
for
american
foreign
policy.
yet,
despite
these
views
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
think
are
self-evident,
for
the
reasons
i've
already
indicated,
neither
appellee
nor
the
communist
party
can
secure
consideration
by
the
board
of
the
proposition
that
its
registration
order
rests
on
a
manifestly
fictitious
premise,
nor
could
the
appellee
litigate
this
issue
in
its
criminal
trial
since
the
court,
this
court,
in
its
'61
decision
held
the
question
to
be
a
matter
for
statutory
construction.
i
submit,
therefore,
that
it's
incumbent
on
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
what
everybody
knows
the
fact
to
be
and
to
declare
in
the
words
of
your
1961
decision
that,
and
again
i
quote,
the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
the
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.
such
a
declaration
would
not
only
invalidate
section
5
but
would
have
the
host
of
effect
of
sweeping
away
the
other
tattered
remains
of
legislation
that
embodies
the
savage
and
irrational
anti-communism
of
a
period
that
has
been
so
destructive
both
of
constitutional
liberty
and
of
our
national
dignity.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
outset,
something
that
i
think
mr.
maroney
said,
but
--
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case
and
that
is
that
this
statute
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
person
to
work
in
a
facility
that
the
secretary
of
defense
has
designated
as
a
defense
facility
solely
because
of
the
bare
fact
that
he
holds
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization
that
has
been
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
now,
judge
lindberg,
the
district
judge
thought
and
i
think
quite
properly
that
the
statute
of
this
time
applies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
scales
case
and
more
pertinently
in
the
aptheker
case.
and
in
order
to
get
around
what
he
considered
to
be
that
constitutional
infirmity
in
reluctant
to
declare
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional,
he
reinterpreted
the
statute
by
reading
into
it
elements
that
the
statute
doesn't
have.
that
is
to
say
the
element
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
accused
that
the
organization
of
which
he
is
a
member
has
an
unlawful
purpose,
an
intent
to
effectuate
that
purpose
and
activity
looking
to
that
entity.
and
it's
so
construed,
he
said,
the
statute
might
be
constitutional
and
he
therefore
dismissed
the
indictment
because
it
doesn't
contain
these
allegations.
now,
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
statute
doesn't
bear
the
construction,
but
judge
lindberg
gave
it.
and
on
that
question,
it's
your
decision
in
aptheker's
controlling,
that
the
aptheker
said
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
about
section
6
of
the
act.
section
6
makes
the
bare
fact
of
membership
in
an
organization
that
has
been
order
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization,
a
disqualification
for
obtaining
a
passport.
the
court
said
you
can't
cure
this
statute
by
reading
the
elements
of
knowledge
and
intent
and
activity
into
it.
and
that
decision
with
respect
to
section
6,
i
submit,
is
applicable
with
equal
force
to
the
section
we
have
here
today.
now,
in
the
absence
of
these
elements,
knowledge
--
guilty
knowledge
activity
and
intent,
i
submit
that
the
section
is
unconstitutional
in
the
first
place
because
it
violates
the
due
process
principle
that
the
government
may
not
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
interfere
with
the
right
of
an
individual
to
hold
specified
private
employment.
mr.
maroney
defends
the
statute
as
a
reasonable
measure
in
the
interest
of
protecting
the
national
security.
but
if
the
government
had
deliberately
setout
to
find
a
case
which
would
most
strikingly
illustrate
the
fallacy
of
that
claim,
it
couldn't
have
done
better
than
to
pick
this
one.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes
sir,
it's
the
union
out
there.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
machinist
union.
to
send
robel
to
prison,
under
this
indictment,
would
not
only
deprive
him
of
his
personal
liberty,
and
todd,
a
good
machinist,
that
it
would
chip
away
at
the
freedom
of
every
american
and
for
no
conceivable
or
discernable
purpose.
because
robel
and
others
like
him
who
as
the
government's
brief
concedes
and
i
quote
from
it,
“would
never
consider
committing
either
espionage
or
sabotage,
post
no
conceivable
threat
to
our
national
security”,
or
would
there
conviction
and
sentenced
under
this
statute
served
any
legitimate
governmental
interest.
the
invalidity
of
this
indiscriminate
restraint
of
the
right
to
work
is
established
by
the
decision
in
aptheker
which
invalidated
the
similar
indiscriminate
restriction
of
section
6
of
the
act
on
the
right
to
travel.
and
i
must
say
that
i
consider
it
a
real
feat
on
mr.
maroney's
part
to
have
talked
about
this
case
for
55
minutes
before
he
mentioned
the
aptheker
case.
because
the
two
are,
from
a
legal
point
of
view
on
this
question
is
like
this
two-piece
in
a
pod,
section
5
like
section
6
applies
to
members
who
do
not
know
that
the
communist
party
has
any
unlawful
purpose
and
who
believed
that
the
finding
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
that
the
communist
party
is
a
soviet
agent,
he
spoke
on
truthful
and
unwarranted.
the
section
is
therefore
invalid
because
in
aptheker's
words,
and
i
quote
from
it,
it
sweeps
within
its
prohibition
both
knowing
and
unknowing
members.
furthermore,
section
5
like
section
6,
again
to
quote
aptheker,
also
renders
a
relevant,
the
member's
degree
of
activity
in
the
organization
and
his
commitment
to
its
purpose.
furthermore,
section
5
as
aptheker
said
of
section
6,
excludes
consideration
of
additional
relevant
factors.
it
applies
to
every
job
in
an
establishment
that's
been
designated
as
a
defense
facility
even
to
jobs
which
from
a
security
point
of
view
are
completely
insensitive.
and
it
applies
to
all
members
of
the
organization
who
hold
these
jobs,
even
though
in
doing
so,
they
are
motivated
by
nothing
more
dangerous
than
the
common
desire
of
all
us
to
earn
a
living.
section
6
like
--
or
section
5
like
section
6,
therefore,
is
an
extreme
example
of
the
imputation
of
guilt
from
associations.
it
established
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
every
member
of
the
communist
party
merely
because
of
the
fact
of
his
membership
is
likely
to
endanger
the
national
defense
every
time
he
has
given
access
to
a
defense
facility,
to
the
premises
of
the
defense
facility.
this
presumption
is
invalid
because
as
aptheker
stated
and
again
i
quote,
“it
is
supported
only
by
a
tenuous
relationship
between
the
bare
fact
or
organizational
membership
and
the
activity
congress
sought
to
prescribe.”
furthermore,
as
in
the
case
of
section
6,
congress
could
have
accomplished
it's
objectives
by
less
drastic
because
more
discriminating
means.
these
are
exemplified,
these
means,
in
the
first
place
by
the
industrial
security
program
that
mr.
maroney
mentioned
a
program
administered
by
the
department
of
defense
and
presently
applicable
to
the
employees
of
the
defense
contractors.
congress
could
of
course,
very
readily
have
extended
it,
if
it
wanted
too,
to
all
employees
of
defense
facilities.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
they
could
not
because
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chief
justice,
no
they
could
not
because
i'm
just
going
to
say
in
a
moment
that
program
is
less
drastic
and
more
discriminating
that
this
statute.
but
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
one
moment.
this
industrial
security
program
and
its
predecessors
date
back
to
world
war
ii
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
and
mr.
maroney
said
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
program
hasn't
proved
entirely
adequate
as
an
internal
security
measure.
the
program
is
less
drastic
than
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
in
two
respects.
first,
it
makes
membership
in
a
communist
organization,
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
all
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
determining
whether
an
employee
is
a
security
risk.
and
second,
persons
are
denied
security
--
who
are
denied
security
clearance,
aren't
barred
from
all
employment
in
the
plant,
they
are
only
barred,
from
access
to
classified
information
and
to
jobs
of
course,
which
require
such
access.
this
approach
reflects
the
common
sense
view
that
there
is
no
danger
in
applying
a
security
risk
in
a
job
that's
completely
insensitive.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
conceivable
but
anybody
can
--
i
suppose,
could
disrupt
the
activities
of
any
employee,
of
the
immediate
job
that
he's
on
by
some
kind
of
conduct.
but
as
mr.
maroney
told
us,
he's
fired,
removed
from
these
--
from
a
sensitive
work
that's
going
out
in
the
plant.
he
doesn't
have
access
to
the
parts
of
the
shipyard
where
they're
building
destroyers
or
engaging
in
other
sensitive
activity.
and
it's
hard
to
conceived
what
he
could
do
that
would
be
disruptive.
and
i
call
your
attention
mr.
justice
fortas
to
cole
versus
young
in
which
the
court,
because
of
this
consideration,
interpreted
the
security
statute
--
or
not
the
security
statute,
in
that
case
with
the
president's
executive
order,
as
applying
only
to
security
sensitive
jobs.
the
1957
report
of
the
commission
on
government
security,
similarly
to
the
industrial
security
program,
opposed
the
exclusion
of
security
risks
from
non-sensitive
employment,
labeling
such
a
measure,
and
i
quote,
“objectionable
and
unnecessary.”
the
same
report
also
recommended
that
in
determining
the
significance
for
security
purposes
of
membership
in
a
communist
organization,
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
factors
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
the
member's
own
intent
in
joining
it
and
the
degree
of
his
participation
in
its
activities,
factors
which
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
we
don't
--
we
don't
argue
in
terms
of
excessive
congressional
delegation
mr.
justice
brennan
because
this
court
has
approved
some
pretty
broad
delegations.
we
do
argue
it
in
terms
of
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
have
thought
so
before
i've
read
some
of
your
decisions
in
which
you've
authorized
some
awfully
broad
delegation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
schechter
is
kind
old
fashioned
these
days,
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
still
of
the
books,
we
might
well
have
argue
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
are
about
four
constitutional
questions
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case,
no
doubt
about
it.
but
i
think
this
case
is
ended
by
aptheker
before
you
reach
this
sticky
a
question
as
a
delegation
question.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
the
constitutional
questions
i'm
now
arguing,
that
is
to
say
the
unreasonable
and
from
substantive
due
process
point
of
view.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
with
the
--
except
in
the
decision
that
the
court
rendered,
obviously.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
can't
cite
the
cases
to
you
offhand.
i
can't
cite
all
of
the
cases
to
you
offhand,
justice
black
but
my
--
our
research
brought
us
to
the
conclusion
that
delegation
substantially
has
brought
us
the
delegation
of
power
in
this
case
had
been
improved
by
the
court
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
perhaps.
in
any
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
your
views
on
delegation
adhere
much
more
closely
to
schechter
than
that
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
court.
again,
while
the
act
was
in
debate
--
it
is
being
debated
in
the
congress,
the
department
of
justice
as
mr.
maroney
has
indicated,
to
the
position
that
--
or
opposed
rather
a
proposal
to
bar
persons
from
federal
employment
solely
in
the
basis
of
their
organizational
membership.
now,
he
stated
and
answered
i
think
to
a
question
from
the
chief
justice
that
this
statute
cures
the
objection
that
the
department
then
found
to
that
statute.
of
course,
this
statute
doesn't
cure
the
department's
objection,
the
department
changed
its
position.
the
letter
from
the
department
to
the
committee
of
congress
which
was
considering
that
measure
is
quoted
at
page
513
of
the
aptheker
case
and
here's
what
acting
attorney
general
ford
said
to
that
bill.
“the
bill
would
brand
the
member
of
a
listed
organization
a
felon,
no
matter
how
innocent
his
membership;
the
loyalty
program
enables
the
member
to
respond
to
charges
against
him
and
to
show,
in
a
manner
consistent
with
american
concepts
of
fairness
and
justice,
that
his
membership
is
innocent
and
does
not
reflect
on
his
loyalty."
now
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
a
showing
that
this
statute
denies
to
robel
in
this
case.
there
is
no
substance
to
the
government's
attempts
to
distinguish
this
case
from
aptheker
and
let
me
address
myself
to
the
distinctions
that
the
government
urges
in
its
brief,
since
mr.
maroney
spoke
only
very
briefly
on
the
question
during
his
portion
of
the
argument.
first,
the
government
says
that
section
6
is
broader
than
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d),
the
section
were
dealing
with
here
because
section
6
supplies
to
communist-fund
organizations
while
this
section
applies
only
to
member
of
communist-action
organization.
but
aptheker,
invalidated
section
6
as
applied
to
members
of
the
communist
party
and
to
leading
members
of
the
communist
party
or
persons
characterized
as
top-ranking
party
leaders
at
that.
second,
the
government
says
that
the
right
to
travel
is
more
basic
than
the
right
to
work.
this
belies
what
it
said
in
its
brief
in
aptheker
case
that
the
denial
of
passports
and
i
quote
“is
a
considerably
milder
disability
than
the
loss
of
employment.”
of
course
both
rights
are
basic.section
5
and
section
6
are,
and
they
were
intended
to
be
complementary
and
together
to
make
life
intolerable
for
communists.
as
justice
black
put
it
in
his
dissent
in
the
party
registration
case
and
i
quote,
“the
act
makes
it
extremely
difficult
for
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
live
in
this
country
and
at
the
same
time,
makes
it
a
crime
for
him
to
try
and
get
a
passport
to
get
out”.
furthermore,
this
court
in
wieman
versus
updegraff
and
on
the
last
term
in
elfbrandt
versus
russell,
applied
the
rule
invoked
in
aptheker
to
invalidate
a
statute
making
membership
in
a
communist
organization,
a
disqualification
for
employment.
the
arizona
statute
involved
in
elfbrandt
was
narrower
than
section
5
because
it
at
least
applied
only
to
members
having
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
purpose
of
the
organization.
the
court
nevertheless
invalidated
the
statute
because
it
reached
members
who
did
not
themselves
subscribed
to
this
unlawful
purpose
or
engaged
in
unlawful
organizational
activities.
the
government
says
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
elfbrandt
because
elfbrandt
involves
state
employment
and
less
grave
public
interest
or
a
more
grave
public
interest
is
at
stake
here
in
the
case
of
defense
facility
employment.
but
certainly,
some
jobs
in
state
governments,
to
which
section
5
applies
are
more
security
sensitive
than
many
of
the
non-sensitive
jobs
to
which
this
statute
applies.
to
give
you
only
one
example,
only
last
week,
up
in
new
york,
a
member
of
the
new
york
state
police
who
was
a
minuteman
was
arrested,
a
minuteman
who
used
his
job
in
the
new
york
state
police
to
filter
all
arsenal
weapons
for
the
use
of
the
minuteman.
elfbrandt
invalidated
the
arizona
statute
as
to
all
state
employment,
sensitive
or
non-sensitive.
because
as
it's
stated
at
page
17
and
i
quote,
“those
who
join
an
organization
but
do
not
share
its
unlawful
purposes
and
who
do
not
participate
in
its
unlawful
activities,
surely
pose
no
threat
either
as
citizens
or
public
employees.”
such
persons
surely
pose
no
threat,
these
elfbrandt
words
as
defense
employees
either.
next,
the
government
argues
that
congress
had
no
less
drastic
means
available
than
the
means
used
in
section
5.
says,
that
are
being
impractical
to
apply
the
screening
technique
of
the
industrial
security
program
to
defense
facilities
in
view
of
the
greater
number
of
employees
involved.
but
--
and
here's
where
the
three
million
figure
came
from
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
way
back
as
of
1956,
10
years
ago,
they
had
already
screened
three
million
employees
under
the
industrial
security
program.
and
mr.
maroney
said
here
this
morning
that
he
was
advised
that
the
defense
facilities
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense
involved
only
about
1%
of
total
employment
in
the
united
states.
well,
if
you
take
the
total
figure
of
70
million
that
would
give
us
seven
million
employees
of
defense
facilities
of
whom
three
million
had
already
been
screened
way
back
in
1956.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
at
one
point
in
his
argument
mr.
justice
brennan,
he
did
said
that
1%
of
the
number
of
facilities.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
him
whether
wasn't
it
true
that
there
were
great
many
more
employees
involved,
and
mr.
maroney
said,
“no,
i
think
not.
i've
been
advised
by
some
of
the
defense
department
that
the
ratio
is
about
the
same”.
besides
which
if
practicality
is
a
consideration,
a
more
impractical
measure
than
section
5
would
be
hard
to
imagine.
here
it
is,
16
years
after
the
act
was
passed
and
section
5
hasn't
yet
even
got
off
the
ground.
if
our
security
depended
on
its
effectiveness,
we
would
in
pretty
bad
shape
here
16
years
after
the
act
was
passed.
finally
the
government
says
that
the
aptheker
was
distinguishable
because
there
is
less
risk
in
permitting
communists
to
venture
abroad
than
in
allowing
them
access
to
a
defense
facility.
this
argument
conveniently
overlooks
a
lured
picture
of
the
travel
menace
that
the
government
painted
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
in
the
aptheker
case.
but
more
to
the
point,
the
government
can't
cite
a
single
instance
in
which
a
communist
employee
of
a
defense
facility
was
even
suspected
of
espionage
or
sabotage
during
the
whole
16
years
that
the
act
has
been
on
the
books.
and
the
only
instance
it
cites
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
is
based
on
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
and
as
our
brief
shows
has
since
been
completely
discredited.
the
government
also
relies
on
the
findings
of
congress
in
section
2
of
the
act
that
communist-action
organizations
seek
to
accomplish
their
ultimate
political
objective
by
espionage,
sabotage,
and
other
unlawful
means.
but
this
finding
is
contradicted
by
the
report
of
a
board
which
your
company
that's
ordered,
that's
the
communist
party
register
under
the
act.
the
report
reviewed
the
party's
activities
at
great
length
for
the
full
period
from
its
organization
in
1919
to
1952.
it
found
by
way
of
conclusion
that
the
party
operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
world
communist
movement
but
it
doesn't
find
a
single
instance
of
espionage,
sabotage
or
the
use
of
any
other
unlawful
means
in
this
entire
period
under
review
and
the
report
says
there
of
any
findings
of
unlawful
party
advocacy
as
it
is
of
a
finding
of
any
other
unlawful
activity.
at
most,
the
board
found
that
the
party
advocated
violence
only
as
a
abstract
and
therefore
protected
political
doctrine
and
this
court
so
viewed
the
findings
in
its
1961
decision
upholding
the
registration
order.
the
decisions
in
the
aptheker
and
wieman
cases
teach
that
the
scienter
required
to
disqualify
a
person
from
employment
or
travel
because
of
membership
in
a
communist
organization
has
actual
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
an
unlawful
purpose.
mere
knowledge
of
the
organization
has
been
officially
condemned
as
insufficient
for
this
purpose.
but
even
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
a
member's
knowledge
of
the
registration
ordered
against
the
communist
party
couldn't
supply
the
necessary
scienter
since
the
order
was
not
accompanied
by
any
finding
of
any
unlawful
party
purpose
of
party
activity.
a
majority
of
the
court
in
the
1961
case
held
that
such
a
finding
of
unlawful
purpose
or
activity
wasn't
essential
to
the
validity
of
the
registration
order
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
it
in
his
opinion,
registration
is
a
regulatory
rather
than
a
prohibitory
statute.
we
disagree
with
that
view
for
the
reasons
that
chief
justice
stated
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
but
however
that
maybe,
the
section
we
have
here
today,
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
is
clearly
prohibitory.
as
a
result
under
the
logic
of
your
1961
decision,
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
are
insufficient
to
support
the
application
of
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
to
members
of
the
party.
both
the
findings
of
the
board
and
the
showing
of
the
government
is
made
in
this
case
demonstrate
that
the
deprivation
of
liberty
imposed
by
section
5
of
the
act
has
no
real,
rational,
reasonable
relation
to
the
national
security.
simply
another
manifestation
of
what
senator
fullbright
has
characterized
and
i
quote
“as
our
morbid
preoccupation
with
the
danger
of
communist
subversion,
a
disease
which
has
proved
so
costly
to
our
personal
freedom
and
perhaps
more
important
to
our
national
dignity.”
the
lack
of
any
rational
basis
for
the
statute
leads
the
government
in
its
brief
to
justify
it
as
a
war
measure
and
to
dismiss
the
lack
of
any
declaration
of
war
against
the
soviet
union
as
a
mere
technicality.
after
reading
the
president's
recent
speeches
on
the
necessity
of
improving
soviet-american
relations,
i
can
only
conclude
that
there
has
been
breakdown
in
communications
between
the
white
house
and
the
department
of
justice,
on
this
phase
of
the
case
and
one
wonders
what
might
not
have
been
wiser
to
appoint
it
under
secretary
of
state
as
attorney
general
rather
than
to
have
made
the
attorney
general
under
secretary
of
the
state.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
going
through
the
picking
question
a
little
bit
later
justice
fortas
if
i
may.
pardon
me?
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
connection
because
the
statute
has
no
application
to
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
certainly
would,
yes,
on
the
basis
of
mere
members
in
the
organization
everything
that
i've
said
about
the
statute
applies
irrespective
of
the
nature
of
the
organization.
we
got
to
prove
something
more
than
organizational
membership,
that's
what
you
said
in
wieman,
that's
what
you
said
in
aptheker,
that's
what
you
said
in
elfbrandt.
i
turn
now
to
the
first
amendment.
by
punishing
members
of
a
radical
or
political
minority
for
engaging
in
specified
private
employment,
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
restrains
the
freedom
of
political
association
which
the
first
amendment
protects.
the
validity
of
the
section
must
therefore
be
judged
by
first
amendment
standards.
the
applicable
standard
is
that
the
legislation
must
be
narrowly
drawn
so
as
not
in
the
words
of
scales
versus
united
states
and
i
quote
“to
cut
deeper
into
the
freedom
of
association
and
as
necessary
to
deal
with
the
substance
of
evils
that
the
congress
has
a
right
to
prevent.
both
the
blunderbuss
impacts
of
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
on
its
face
and
its
application
to
members
of
the
communist
party,
an
organization
which
has
not
been
found
to
engage
in
unlawful
activity
invalidates
the
section
under
this
standard.
the
government's
brief
argues
that
congress
was
justified
in
enacting
the
section
in
preference
to
a
narrowly
drawn
screening
program
because
you
and
i
quote,
“it
has
an
immediate
interim
effect
and
requires
no
bulky
administrative
machinery
to
carry
it
into
practice.”
but
as
this
court
has
so
often
held
considerations
of
administrative
convenience
and
efficiency
that
might
be
persuasive
in
other
context
can
never
justify
the
infringement
of
first
amendment
freedoms.
and
the
interim
effect
of
the
section,
a
feature
which
the
government
seems
to
believe
to
be
so
desirable
and
advantageous
is
enough
alone
to
invalidate
the
section
because
as
this
court
has
said
and
i
think
it
was
in
naacp
versus
button.
these
are
--
these
first
amendment
freedoms
are
delicate
and
vulnerable
and
the
fact
of
sanctions
is
often
sufficient
to
inhibit
their
exercise
even
if
the
sanctions
are
not
applied.
the
statute's
chilling
effect
on
the
first
amendment
freedoms
of
all
americans,
communists
and
non-communist
was
depicted
by
president
truman
in
his
veto
message
in
which
he
said
after
reviewing
the
effect
of
a
statute,
the
inevitable
--
and
i
quote,
“the
inevitable
tendency
would
be
to
express
null
obvious
uncontroversial
subjects.”
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
three
questions
which
haven't
been
touched
on
the
government's
brief
and
only
one
of
which
was
touched
on
in
request
of
mr.
maroney's
argument.
the
first
of
these
involves
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
that
the
indictment
is
defective
because
it
alleges
only
if
the
communist
party
has
been
ordered
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization
but
not
that
the
communist
party
is
in
fact
such
an
organization.
and
i
think
mr.
maroney
inadvertently
misdescribed
the
indictment
when
i
was
opening
remarks
and
said
the
indictment
charges
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization.
there
is
no
such
allegation.
the
only
allegation
is
that
it's
been
harder
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
his
latter
allegation
that
is
to
say
the
fact,
the
allegation
that
the
party
is
a
communist-action
organization
was
omitted
because
the
government
interpret
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
as
making
the
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
conclusive
as
to
its
character
for
the
purposes
of
a
prosecution
under
the
section.
this
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
the
introductory
clause
of
section
5
provides,
and
i
quote,
“when
a
communist
organization”
and
i
interject
to
say
that
means
under
the
statute
either
a
communist
action
or
a
communist
front
organization,
“when
a
communist
organization
is
registered
or
there
is
in
effect
a
final
order
requiring
such
organization
to
register
then
it
becomes
unlawful
for
the
members
to
do
certain
things.”
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d),
the
subsection
of
that
section
which
is
immediately
involved
here
provides
and
i
quote,
“if
such
organization
referring
back
to
a
communist
action
or
communist
fund
organization
that
has
been
ordered
to
register.
if
such
organization
is
a
communist-action
organization
then
it
is
unlawful
for
the
members
to
hold
defense
facility
employment.
i
think
it's
clear
from
this
wording
that
section
5
is
applicable
to
the
members
of
an
organization
which
both
is
a
communist
organization
or
in
the
case
of
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d),
a
communist-action
organization
and
which
is
either
registered
or
been
ordered
to
register
as
such
an
organization.
in
other
words,
congress
in
this
section
made
the
existence
of
the
fact
and
not
only
of
the
board's
finding
as
to
the
fact
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
wording
of
other
criminal
provisions
of
the
act
cited
in
our
brief
showed
that
this
result
was
deliberate.
or
one
of
them
unlike
section
5
(a)
(1)
(d)
and
section
6
(a)
makes
the
fact
as
well
as
the
findings
an
element
of
the
offense.
others
like
section
6
(b)
of
the
act,
section
10,
section
15
(a)
clearly
predicates
the
criminal
liability
only
on
the
existence
of
a
registration
order
and
the
finding
by
the
board
that
the
organization
is
that
a
communist
organization
and
not
on
its
actual
character.
the
construction
of
section
5
in
accordance
with
its
text
as
i've
indicated
it
is
required
by
the
rule
of
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes
and
as
compelled,
we
think
by
three
constitutional
considerations
that
i'd
like
to
indicate
very
briefly
here.
first,
the
government's
construction
of
the
section
denies
appellee
procedural
due
process
because
it
precludes
him
from
challenging
in
the
criminal
proceedings
the
validity
of
the
board's
1953
determination
that
the
communist
party
was
a
communist-action
organization,
a
determination
made
in
a
proceeding
to
which
it
was
not
a
party.
moreover,
even
if
it
could
be
said
that
the
appellee
is
bound
by
the
board's
determination
taken
in
his
absence
could
still
be
entitled
to
litigate
the
current
character
of
the
organization
or
the
current
validity
of
the
board's
determination
which
is
now
13
years
old
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
1961
case
is
based
on
evidence
that's
far
more
than
13
years
old.
we
--
our
position
is
that
the
appellee
is
not
accorded
due
process
by
section
13
of
the
act
which
permits
a
registered
organization
to
apply
periodically
to
the
board
for
a
redetermination
of
the
status.
in
the
first
place,
this
procedural
is
available
only
to
organizations
and
not
to
individuals.
therefore,
it's
not
available
to
the
appellee.
furthermore,
it's
not
available
to
the
communist
party.
because
under
section
13,
an
organization
must
first
register
in
a
communist-action
organization
before
it
can
apply
to
the
board
for
a
redetermination
of
its
status.
now,
the
communist
party
hasn't
registered
under
the
act.
it's
still
litigating
the
constitutionality
of
enforcement
of
that
provision
against
it
under
the
questions
that
are
litigating
the
questions
which
is
quite
held
premature
in
the
1961
case.
obviously,
it's
got
a
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
have
those
questions
determined
and
the
appellee
can't
be
denied
these
constitutional
rights
because
the
communist
party
is
asserting
its
own.
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
section
would
also
invalidate
it
as
a
bill
of
attainder.
in
the
1961
case,
a
majority
of
the
court
held
that
the
act's
registration
requirement
didn't
obtain
the
organization.
this
conclusion
was
based
on
the
few
that
section
13
would
permit
the
party
to
secure
a
periodically
determination
of
its
status
and
hence
that
observance
of
the
obligations,
have
registration
and
impales
is
made
to
turn
on
what
the
court
in
its
opinion
called
and
i
quote,
“continuously
contemporaneous
fact
in
this
effect.”
but
as
i
have
shown
the
party
can't
secure
a
redetermination
of
its
status
so
long
as
it
resists
the
effort
to
enforce
the
registration
requirement
against
it.
nor
paradoxically
will
that
ever
be
able
to
secure
a
redetermination
of
it's
status,
if
it's
successful
in
the
pending
litigation
and
the
registration
order
is
found
to
be
constitutionally
unenforceable.
in
any
event,
a
section
13
proceeding
isn't
available
to
the
appellee.
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute
therefore
which
doesn't
give
the
appellee
to
the
right
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
determination
on
the
criminal
trial,
he
has
no
possible
escape
from
the
effect
of
a
board's
determination
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization
even
if
that
determination
no
longer
has
any
validity.
his
position
that
is
the
appellee's
position
today
is
exactly
the
same
as
all
of
the
communist
party
has
been
named
in
the
act.
the
board's
determination
that
the
communist
party
isn't
a
communist-action
organization,
it
has
that
effect
as
to
him
and
that
being
so
the
statute
as
the
government
would
interpret
is
invalid
under
the
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
brown.
the
final
constitutional
difficulty
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
section
entails
is
that
it
deprives
the
appellee
of
the
rights
of
indictment
by
grand
jury,
a
trial
by
petty
jury
and
proof
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
so
because
section
5
can't
be
constitutionally
applied
to
him
unless
at
least
the
communist
party
is
of
characteristics
which
the
act
attributes
to
a
communist-action
organization.
yet
under
the
government's
construction
of
statute
this
issue
affect
was
withdrawn
from
the
grand
jury
that
returns
the
indictment
and
the
petty
jury
that
deprives
the
case
and
is
confided
to
an
administrative
agency,
the
subversive
activities
control
board
which
moreover
is
told
to
make
its
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
not
on
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
if
this
procedure
were
permissible,
congress
could
frame
almost
any
offense
in
terms
that
would
provide
for
the
determination
of
essential
facts
by
an
administrative
agency
and
thus
bypass
the
jury
trial
of
the
most
controversial
factual
issues
on
which
criminal
liability
depends.
to
cite,
give
you
only
one
example,
congress
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
it's
a
crime
for
a
taxpayer
to
refuse
to
pay,
fail
to
pay
a
deficiency
which
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
has
determined
because
the
taxpayer
failed
to
report
income
which
he
earned
making
the
internal
revenue
services
determination
that
taxpayer
earn
income
and
failed
to
report
it
are
conclusive
for
the
purpose
of
(voice
overlap)
cases.
certainly
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
would
cure
of
the
particular
point
that
i'm
now
discussing
justice
fortas
because
we
no
longer
have
been
talking
about
a
criminal
statute.
it
wouldn't
cure
of
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
under
elfbrandt,
under
wieman,
under
aptheker,
that
the
state's
invalidity
which
resides
in
a
fact
that
statute
makes
a
the
bare
fact
of
membership
without
consideration
of
these
other
essential
elements,
a
disqualification
for
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
not
that
society
didn't
mean
what
it
says
but
that
the
member
didn't
endorse
the
use
of
the
society
when
it
became
a
member;
it
may
have
become
a
member
to
reformat,
it
may
have
become
a
member
because
the
fbi
send
them
in
there
as
a
(inaudible)
agent,
an
informant.
it
may
have
become
a
member
for
a
lot
of
different
purposes
and
you
can
wreck
my
view
by
changing
the
name
of
the
outcome
mr.
justice
fortas
because
there
is
something
much
more
essential
involved
here.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
every
case,
that's
what
the
court
held
in
the
twin
cases
of
scales
and
noto.
mr.
john
j.
abt
now,
you're
asking
me
a
very
easy
question.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
i
have
to
think
about
it
if
you
put
it
in
terms
of
a
civil
sanction.
i
still
think
my
first
reaction
would
be
yes.
under
elfbrandt,
under
wieman,
under
--
which
your
civil
cases,
which
involved
only
a
disqualification,
they're
not
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
john
j.
abt
best
answer
i
can
give
you
on
that
justice
fortas
is
what
the
court
of
the
commission
on
government
security
said
in
1957
and
they
would
know
that
as
fire
out
lifters
i
believe
as
i
recall
that
as
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
president
of
the
american
bar
association
that
was
a
tripartite
commission,
i
think
senator
eastland
former
chairman
of
the
un-american
activities
--
pardon
--
were
both
members
of
it
and
they
said
that
--
they
proposed
the
statute
--
a
model
statute
on
government
security
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
their
report.
and
that
statute
proposal
provides
that
mere
membership
in
the
organization
is
not
sufficient
that
the
body
considering
the
security
question
must
consider
the
purpose
that
the
member
had
in
joining
it,
his
actual
knowledge
of
the
purpose
of
the
organization
and
the
degree
of
his
participation
in
these
activities.
and
i
go
along
with
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
i
would.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
a
kind
of
a
security
system
that
we've
had
during
and
ever
since
world
war
ii
with
reference
to
defense
contractors
in
the
most
secret
jobs
there
are.
that
the
government,
the
industrial
security
programs
sets
up
a
screening
system.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
under
the
department
of
defense's
regulations,
mere
membership
is
not
disqualifying
for
security
clearance
in
the
access
to
the
most
secret
work.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
it
hasn't
been
a
question
of
litigation
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
merely,
on
the
basis
of
the
bare
effective
organizational
membership?
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
mere,
their
membership
isn't
enough.
you
got
to
show
something
more
about
the
individual,
personal
qualities
of
the
individual.
otherwise,
you're
--
this
is
pure
guilt
by
association
and
let
me
say
well,
a
man
is
a
fool
to
join
such
an
organization
that
he
doesn't
believe
in
it.
but
the
fact
that
the
man
is
a
fool
doesn't
make
him
a
security
risk.
the
government
says
that
if
they're
required
to
prove
the
character
of
this
organization
in
each
prosecution
under
section
5
that
section
5
would
be
unenforceable.
but
as
i
noted
in
answering
one
of
justice
fortas'
questions
that's
a
precisely
what
this
court
held
that
the
government
has
to
do
in
cases
under
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
in
its
decision
in
noto
versus
united
states.
besides
that,
you
have
section
5
is
unenforceable.
it
will
be
because
the
act
as
a
whole
was
unenforceable,
as
16
years
of
ruthless
litigation
should
by
this
time
pretty
well
have
established.
it's
unenforceable
because
it
attempts
to
do
the
impossible,
to
accomplish
an
unconstitutional
purpose,
the
outlawry
of
a
political
party
in
a
constitutional
manner.
any
congress
surprised
to
accomplish
this
is
bound
to
stumble.
the
statute
is
bound
to
be
unenforceable
either
because
it's
unworkable
or
because
it's
unconstitutional
or
both,
as
president
truman
held
or
stated
in
his
veto
message
was
the
case
with
this
statute.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
that's
the
next
point
that
i
was
going
to
simply
state.
we've
argued
it
in
our
brief.
we
didn't
make
the
delegation
point
that
you
raised
mr.
justice
douglas
--
justice
brennan.
we
do
say
that
there's
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
here
because
of
the
act
affords
no
hearing
whatsoever
that
the
person's
affected
before
a
defense
--
a
plant
is
declared
to
be
a
defense
facility
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's'
not
sufficient.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
we
argued
at
the
point
of
procedural
due
process
that
before
a
man's
hurt
by
a
designation,
he's
got
the
right
to
be
heard
as
to
the
validity
of
the
designation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
not
an
issue
of
the
trial.
and
the
indictment
doesn't
allege
that
the
plant
is
a
defense
facility
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
it
only
alleges
a
designation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
at
a
minimum.
i
think
even
that
would
be
insufficient
because
i
think
before
a
man's
indicted
for
working
in
a
defense
facility,
he's
got
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
designation
was
a
proper
one
or
not.
and
he
can't
have
that
hearing
only
in
connection
with
a
criminal
trial.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
a
risk
of
violating
a
statute
in
facing
a
criminal
trial
before
he
can
make
that
point.
my
final
point
deals
with
the
question
that
justice
fortas
raised.
we
say
that
the
section
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
because
the
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
has
been
invalidated
by
facts
of
which
this
court
can
and
should
take
judicial
notice
showing
at
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
doesn't
exist.
by
definition
there
can't
be
a
communist-action
organization
unless
there's
a
world
communist
movement
that
meets
the
section
2
description.
this
is
so
because
the
definition
of
a
communist-action
organization
is
tied
in
with
the
findings
of
section
2.
section
33
defines
a
communist-action
organization
as
an
organization
which
is
controlled
by
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
and
which
operates
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
movement
described
in
section
2.
section
2
finds
that
there
exists
a
world
communist
movement
made
up
of
communist-action
organizations
which
are
not
free
and
independent
but
are
national
sections
of
the
world
communist
movement
and
are
controlled
by
and
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
communist
dictatorship
of
an
unnamed
foreign
country.
the
board
found
that
this
country
was
the
soviet
union.
now
on
affirming
the
board's
order
against
the
communist
party,
the
court
in
its
1961
decision
held
that
the
characteristics
of
the
world
communist
movement
and
the
source
of
its
control
as
found
in
section
2
are
not
subject
to
proof
or
disproof
in
the
registration
proceedings.
it
regarded
the
finding
of
the
board
that
the
soviet
union
was
the
unnamed
foreign
power
referred
to
in
section
2
as
a
matter
of
law
-
question
of
law,
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
which
it
affirmed.
the
court
recognized
that
a
change
in
the
world
situation
would
invalidate
this
construction
and
that
the
time
might
come
when
in
its
words
and
i
quote,
“the
board
or
a
reviewing
court
will
be
able
to
say
that
the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
in
the
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.”
well,
as
mr.
justice
fortas's
question
implies,
the
future
world
situation
which
the
opinion
envisaged
has
materialized.
whatever
may
have
been
said
about
the
section
2
findings
in
1950
when
they
were
made,
the
description
of
communism
as
a
monolithic
world
movement
under
iron
soviet
control
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
all
free
governments
by
a
criminal
means
applies
in
the
face
of
the
facts
of
contemporary
political
life
as
everybody
knows.
yet
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated,
neither
the
appellee
nor
the
communist
party
can
secure
board
consideration
of
these
facts
nor
could
the
appellee
litigate
the
issue
in
this
criminal
trial
since
the
court
in
the
1961
case
held
the
issue
as
one
of
statutory
construction.
accordingly,
it's
incumbent
on
the
court,
this
court,
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
self-evident
fact
that
in
the
words
of
your
1961
decision,
“the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
to
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.”
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
of
course
not.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
defer
discussion
of
the
delegation
question
until
a
little
later
of
my
argument
and
start
with
the
due
process
--
substantive
due
process
first
amendment
question
that
the
case
presents.
section
5(a)(1)(d)
provides
that
upon
the
issuance
of
a
final
registration
order
requiring
a
communist-action
organization
to
register
under
the
act,
it
becomes
a
crime
for
a
member
of
the
organization
with
knowledge
or
notice
of
the
order
and
the
designation
to
hold
or
even
to
apply
for
employment
in
a
defense
facility,
and
let
me
say
that
what
notice'
or
knowledge'
means
under
this
statute
is
simply
this,
a
man
has
notice
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
by
virtue
of
its
publication
in
the
federal
register.
he
has
notice
of
the
designation
of
a
plant,
the
plant
in
which
he
works
or
which
he
applies
for
a
job
as
a
defense
facility
by
virtue
of
the
posting
in
the
plant
of
notices
of
a
fact
of
a
designation.
that's
all
the
notice'
and
knowledge'
mean
under
this
section
of
this
statute.
now,
the
indictment
here
charges
the
existence
of
a
final
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
ordering
it
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization,
the
designation
by
the
secretary
of
defense
of
the
seattle
division
of
todd
shipyards
as
a
defense
facility,
a
membership
by
robel
in
the
communist
party,
and
his
employment
at
todd's
with
knowledge
and
notice
of
both
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
and
of
the
designation
of
the
plant
as
a
defense
facility.
section
5
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
indictment
makes
robel
guilty
of
an
offense
even
though
he
does
not
know
that
the
communist
party
has
any
unlawful
purpose
of
any
kind
and
even
though
he
rejects
as
false
and
unwarranted
of
the
characterization
given
the
party
by
the
subversive
activities
control
board
as
a
soviet
agent
in
its
1953
registration
order.
it's
equally
irrelevant
to
robel's
guilt
under
the
statute
and
the
indictment
that
he
may
have
joined
the
party
and
remained
a
member
for
a
completely
legitimate
political
purpose
for
the
accomplishment
of
perfectly
lawful
political
objectives
and
that
his
activity
on
behalf
of
the
organization
has
been
lawful,
peaceable
and
constitutionally
protected.
thus,
although
section
5
parades
as
an
anti-espionage
and
anti-sabotage
law
as
written
and
applied,
it
reaches
members
of
the
communist
party
who
have
no
criminal
propensities,
whose
conduct
and
state
of
mind
are
completely
blameless
and
who
as
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief,
and
i
quote,
would
never
consider
committing
either
espionage
or
sabotage.
as
several
members
of
the
court
have
already
noted,
the
over
breadth
of
the
statute
is
exemplified
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
when
he
was
indicted
in
1953,
the
district
judge
found
that
robel
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
is
an
employee
of
the
todd
shipyards
for
upwards
of
ten
years.
mr.
john
j.
abt
1963,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
but
he
had
at
that
time
been
employed
at
least
since
1953.
following
his
arrest,
he
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance
and
promptly
returned
to
his
job
where
he's
working
to
this
very
day
obviously
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
concerned.
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
if
the
government
had
wanted
to
--
thought
he
was
a
security
risk
and
wanted
him
fired,
he's
got
plenty
of
leverage
to
use
against
the
todd
shipyards
to
get
him
fired.
if
the
todd
shipyards
saw
that
he
was
a
security
risk
in
the
job
where
he's
working
at
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
withdraw
the
attribution
to
you,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
was
an
error,
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
--
and
i'm
not
suggesting
any
improper
leverage
that
if
the
government
thought
that
he
was
a
security
risk
in
the
job
that
he
held,
he
would
no
longer
be
holding
that
job.
mr.
john
j.
abt
if
he
was
working
on
classified
work,
your
honor,
or
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
certainly,
if
todd
shipyards
thought
that
he
was
a
security
risk
and
was
about
to
or
threatened
or
there
was
any
danger
of
the
sabotage
or
espionage
on
his
part
that
todd's
would
have
found
a
way
to
fire
him
and
that
could
have
done
very
easily.
mr.
john
j.
abt
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they're
perfectly
free
to
do
so,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there's
a
union
contract.
and
there
might
possibly
be
a
grievance
under
the
union
contract.
but
if
they
can
establish
that
the
man
is
a
security
risk,
i'm
sure
that
the
union
is
not
going
to
defend
his
right
to
that
job.
and
there's
been
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
shipyard
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
take
it
that
they're
very
--
that
they're
very
delighted
to
have
a
first-class
machinist
on
the
job.
machinists
are
hard
to
come
by
these
days.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
is
not
much
to
remind
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
america
would
be
a
safer
place
to
live
in
if
this
man
were
sent
to
jail
and
thereby
deprived
of
both
of
his
liberty
and
of
the
job
that
he's
held
for
upwards
of
15
years.
when
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
case
was
made
in
the
district
court,
the
court
held
the
motion
in
advance
pending
the
decision
by
this
court
of
the
aptheker
case
and
they
didn't
hand
down
the
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
about
a
year
awaiting
your
decision
on
aptheker.
when
aptheker
came
down,
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
indictment.
he
recognized
that
section
5
in
the
light
of
aptheker,
scales
and
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
archie
brown
versus
united
states
would
violate
the
first
amendment
and
due
process
as
an
indiscriminate
and
overbroad
restraint
on
protected
freedoms
unless
the
elements
of
knowledge
by
the
accused
that
the
communist
party
has
an
unlawful
purpose,
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
accused
to
effectuate
that
purpose
and
some
kind
of
activity
toward
that
end
could
be
read
into
the
statute
by
interpretation.
he
therefore
sought
to
save
the
statute
by
reading
these
elements
into
it
and
dismissed
the
indictment
for
failing
to
allege
him.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
section
5
doesn't
bear
the
interpretation
that
the
district
court
placed
on
it
not
because
it
would
make
the
act
a
nullity
but
because
it
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
aptheker
case
where
the
identical
question
of
interpretation
was
presented
under
section
6
of
the
act,
the
passport
prohibition
of
the
act,
and
the
decision
there
that
section
6
can't
be
rewritten
to
supply
the
missing
elements
we
think
is
applicable
with
equal
force
to
section
5.
without
these
elements,
section
5
violates
due
process
and
the
first
amendment
by
placing
overbroad
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
restraints
both
upon
the
liberty
of
an
individual
to
hold
private
employment
protected
by
due
process
and
upon
his
freedom
of
association
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
say
not
under
your
decisions,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
i'm
coming
to
them
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may.
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
section
under
both
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
is
established
by
the
decision
in
aptheker,
by
elfbrandt
versus
russell
and
by
keyishian
versus
the
board
of
regents,
the
latter
case
decided
only
last
term
after
this
case
was
first
argued.
aptheker
invalidated
section
6
of
the
act
for
making
it
a
crime
for
a
member
of
an
organization
against
which
a
final
registration
order
has
been
issued
to
apply
for
or
use
a
passport.
elfbrandt
struck
down
an
arizona
statute
denying
public
employment
to
members
of
the
communist
party
with
notice
that
the
party
had
an
unlawful
purpose
--
and
with
knowledge,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
sorry,
that
the
party
had
an
unlawful
purpose.
and
keyishian
invalidated
a
complex
of
new
york
statutes
whose
effect
was
to
make
membership
in
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
that
an
advocated
forcible
overthrow
a
bar
to
public
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
they
did
not
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
think
--
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
it
makes
the
material
different,
sir.
the
army
is
the
most
extreme
and
perhaps
an
arguable
case,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
certainly,
the
right
to
employment
in
peace
time
seems
to
me
is
squarely
within
these
cases,
certainly
squarely
within
the
cases
that
relate
to
state
employment.
a
state
employment
can
be
at
least
as
sensitive
and
many
cases
more
sensitive
than
employment
of
the
sort
that
--
that
robel
is
engaged
in.
i
can
get
you
to
think
of
all
kinds
of
cases,
membership
or
an
employee
of
the
public
service
commission
who
have
access
to
all
the
public
utilities
in
the
state,
member
of
the
state
police
force,
and
none
of
these
cases,
neither
keyishian
nor
elfbrandt
is
qualified
at
all
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
job.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
right.
and
i
think
under
those
three
cases,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
congress
didn't
have
the
power
to
pass
it
and
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
want
to
come
to
that
a
little
later,
but
first
on
the
power
to
pass
it,
that
is
to
say
on
the
substantive
due
process
and
first
amendment
questions,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
concluded
by
the
principle
stated
in
keyishian,
which
summarized
or
capsulized
the
decisions
in
all
three
cases,
aptheker,
elfbrandt
and
keyishian,
and
it's
very
brief
i
want
to
read
it,
?legislation
which
sanctions
membership
unaccompanied
by
specific
intent
to
further
the
unlawful
goals
of
the
organization
or
which
is
not
active
membership
violates
constitutional
limitations.
and
since
the
employment
sanction
of
section
5
is
imposed
on
a
member
completely
without
regard
to
his
intent
or
his
activity,
it
violates
that
principle.
indeed,
the
case
for
the
application
of
the
principle
is
stronger
here
than
in
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
for
they
dealt
not
with
private
but
with
public
employment
in
which
the
government
has
a
proprietary
as
well
as
a
security
interest.
and
the
statutes
they
invalidated
impose
civil
sanctions
only
while
here,
we
have
a
criminal
statute.
moreover,
section
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yeah,
but
the
new
york
statute,
it
went
far
beyond
teaching.
it
went
to
every
form
of
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
keyishian
as
i
read
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
involved
the
section
of
the
new
york
statute
which
made
it
a
disqualification
for
public
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
that
particular
case,
but
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
as
i
read
your
opinion,
you
struck
down
a
statute
which
disqualified
--
it
was
disqualification
for
any
kind
of
public
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i
could
give
you
cases
--
both
ways
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
think
that
can
be.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
posed
the
case
of
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
which
i
suppose
is
the
most
extreme
case.
i'd
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
principle
that
you
set
forth
in
keyishian
is
applicable
there,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
today
because
we're
not
talking
about
the
army.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
but
both
keyishian
and
elfbrandt
related
to
every
sort
of
state
employment.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
elfbrandt
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
included
such
employees.
mr.
john
j.
abt
additionally,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
statute
in
this
case
goes
far
beyond
the
statutes
in
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
because
it
sanctions
membership
even
though
the
member
has
no
knowledge
of
any
unlawful
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
organization.
indeed,
it
sanctions
membership
even
though
the
organization
has
no
unlawful
purpose
and
that
happens
to
be
the
situation
in
this
case.
they're
a
part
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
that
a
company
in
its
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
reviewed
the
history
of
the
party
from
its
organization
in
1919
to
1953
in
the
most
minute
detail.
it
found
that
the
party
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
world
communist
movement,
but
it
didn't
find
a
single
case,
single
instance
of
espionage,
sabotage
or
other
unlawful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
party
or
any
of
its
members
in
the
whole
period
under
review.
and
the
report
is
equally
bare
of
any
finding
of
unlawful
advocacy.
at
most,
it
found
that
the
party
advocated
forcible
overthrow
as
a
matter
of
abstract
and
hence
constitutionally
protected
doctrine,
and
this
court
so
viewed
the
findings
in
its
1961
decision
affirming
a
registration
order.
majority
held
that
a
finding
of
unlawful
acts
or
advocacy
was
not
a
constitutional
requisite
to
the
validity
of
the
order
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
his
opinion,
registration
is
a
regulatory,
not
a
prohibitory
measure.
we
disagree
with
this
conclusion
for
the
reasons
that
were
stated
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent.
but
whatever
the
case
with
registration,
section
5
is
clearly
a
prohibitory
criminal
statute.
accordingly
on
the
logic
of
the
majority
opinion
in
1961,
the
board's
findings
are
insufficient
to
support
the
application
of
section
5,
a
criminal
statute,
to
the
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
sweep
of
section
5
is
too
broad
and
indiscriminate
for
an
additional
reason.
it
applies
to
every
job
and
any
establishment
that's
been
designated
as
a
defense
facility
including
jobs
that
are
not
security
sensitive
and
from
which
there's
no
rational
reason
for
excluding
persons
even
though
they
may
conceivably
qualify
as
security
risks.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
section
were
to
provide
protection
against
espionage
and
sabotage
which
alleged
extensible
purpose,
this
could
have
been
accomplished
by
less
drastic,
more
discreet,
more
discriminating
means.
these
are
exemplified
first
of
all
by
the
industrial
security
program
to
which
mr.
maroney
referred
for
the
screening
of
employees
of
defense
contractors.
this
program
dates
all
the
way
back
to
world
war
ii
and
evidently
has
proved
to
be
an
adequate
and
satisfactory
security
measure.
mr.
maroney
says
that
this
statute
is
nothing
but
a
screening
program.
but
of
course,
it
is
not.
it's
much
more
drastic
and
less
discriminating
in
three
major
respects.
first,
the
industrial
screening
program
does
not
provide
that
membership
in
a
communist
organization
shall
be
disqualifying
per
se
but
makes
membership
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
all
the
others,
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
determining
whether
an
employee
is
a
security
risk.
secondly,
the
denial
of
security
clearance
is
not
a
bar
to
all
defense
employment
but
only
to
jobs
requiring
access
to
classified
information.
and
finally,
the
sanctions
of
the
program
are
civil
only,
exclusion
from
the
job
and
not
criminal
prosecution.
the
adequacy
of
the
approach
of
the
industrial
security
program
is
attested
by
the
fact
that
it
was
adopted
by
the
presidential
commission
in
government
security
in
legislation
that
recommended
in
1957
and
as
already
been
pointed
out
in
the
argument
by
the
department
of
justice
which
took
the
same
position
on
the
letter
to
congress
while
the
act
was
under
debate
and
by
president
truman
in
his
veto
message,
all
of
whom
call
the
a
blunder
breadth
approach
such
as
taken
by
section
5
ill-considered
objectionable
and
unnecessary.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
persons
who
have
access
to
classified
information,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
abt
of
course.
i'm
sorry,
broader
than
jobs
which
might
affect
the
security
of
united
states?
well,
certainly
as
applied
by
the
secretary,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
--
to
the
question
at
the
moment.
the
latter
is
much
broader
than
the
former.
robel
has
no
access
to
classified
information
and
yet,
section
5
has
been
made
applicable
to
him.
time
has
confirmed
the
accuracy
of
the
characterizations
of
both
the
commission
on
government
security,
the
department
of
justice
and
president
truman
in
his
veto
message.
it's
now
17
years
since
section
5
has
been
on
the
books
and
all
that
time,
it's
been
invoked
only
once
and
then
in
this
case
against
a
man
who
represents
no
danger
to
our
security
or
to
anything
else.
and
the
government
doesn't
and
can't
cite
a
single
case
of
espionage
or
sabotage
either
before
or
after
the
enactment
of
the
act
which
section
5
might
have
prevented
or
which
would
have
been
punishable
under
section
5.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
delegation
question
on
which
the
court
directed
argument.
it's
our
position
that
the
authority
given
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
the
enterprises
where
it
shall
be
a
crime
for
a
communist
to
hold
or
to
even
apply
for
employment
violates
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
the
violation
results
from
the
fact
that
congress
failed
to
specify
standards
or
to
provide
administrative
procedures
to
govern
the
exercise
of
the
secretary's
authority.
the
lack
of
standards
appears
first
from
section
3(7)
which
defines
the
term
facility'
so
broadly,
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
earlier
pointed
out
as
to
include
virtually
any
enterprise
that
employs
people.
section
5(b)
authorizes
the
secretary
to
make
the
employment
sanction
applicable
to
any
facility
simply
by
designating
it
as
a
defense
facility,
and
all
we
need
to
do
to
make
this
designation
is
to
find
that
it's
required
by
the
security
of
the
united
states.
the
act,
unlike
for
example
the
statute
under
consideration
in
yakus,
the
act
doesn't
specify
any
considerations
or
criteria
for
the
guidance
of
the
secretary
in
deciding
whether
or
not
he
can
make
a
finding
at
a
particular
facility
is
required
to
be
designated
by
the
security
of
the
united
states,
nor
can
any
guidelines
be
spelled
out
of
the
findings
of
section
2
of
the
act.
the
government
in
its
brief
pointed
to
the
recital
of
section
2(11)
of
the
act,
and
i
quoted,
the
agents
of
communism
have
devised
clever
and
ruthless
espionage
and
sabotage
tactics
which
are
carried
out
in
many
instances
and
form
or
manner
successfully
evasive
of
existing
law.
but
this
skip
of
congressional
hyperbole
tells
a
secretary
nothing
about
how
or
where
these
supposed
tactics
are
to
be
employed
and
that
therefore
supplies
the
secretary
with
no
criteria
for
administering
section
5(b).
the
fact
is
that
the
act
places
no
restraint
on
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
curtail
and
virtually
to
eliminate
the
employment
opportunities
open
to
communists
other
than
his
own
judgment
as
to
what
the
national
security
requires.
and
any
judgment
on
that
issue
is
a
policy
judgment
which
necessarily
turns
on
the
predilections
and
prejudices
of
the
particular
secretary
of
defense
who
happens
to
make
that
judgment.
hence,
facilities
need
to
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
national
defense
as
we
know
it.
if
some
secretary
of
defense
were
to
conclude
that
communists
are
a
menace
to
the
national
security
in
any
employment
they
hold,
he
has
the
authority
under
the
act
to
foreclose
them
from
practically
all
means
of
livelihood.
the
subjective
and
expansive
character
the
securities
concept
is
reflected
in
justice
jackson's
observation
in
the
knauff
case
and
i
quote,
security
is
like
liberty
in
that
many
are
the
crimes
that
are
committed
in
its
name.
but
section
1
article
1
at
least
makes
commission
of
such
crimes
prerogative
of
congress
and
precludes
it
from
licensing
at
administrative
agency
or
officer
to
commit.
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act's
delegation
is
established
by
panama
refining
versus
ryan
which
invalidated
the
section
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
authorizing
a
president
to
prohibit
the
interstate
transportation
of
oil
in
excess
of
state
--
withdrawn
in
excess
of
state
quotas.
the
court
found
nothing
in
this
statute
which
restricted
or
controlled
the
president
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
and
therefore
held
the
delegation
to
him
unconstitutional
because,
and
i
quote
from
the
decision,
it
gives
a
president
an
unlimited
authority
to
determine
the
policy
and
to
lay
down
the
prohibition
or
not
to
lay
it
down
as
he
may
see
fit.
the
secretary's
authority
to
lay
down
or
not
to
lay
down
the
prohibition
of
section
5(a)(1)(d)
is
similarly
unlimited.
to
hold
otherwise,
because
the
act
calls
for
a
finding
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
a
prohibition
would
reduce
compliance
of
article
1
section
1
to
the
pit
of
ceremonial
rhetoric.
the
unlimited
nature
of
the
secretary's
authority
also
appears
from
the
lack
of
any
requirement
that
he
states
the
facts
on
which
he
bases
his
finding.
the
act
does
not
require
him
to
account
for
or
explain
his
actions
in
any
way.
so
in
the
present
case,
nothing
in
the
indictment
or
elsewhere
on
the
record
indicates
why
robel's
place
of
employment
was
designated.
all
we
are
told
about
it
is
its
name.
mr.
maroney
says
that
its
name
shows
that
it's
a
shipyard.
but
in
this
day
of
the
conglomerate
merger,
the
todd
shipyards
corporation,
seattle
division
is
just
as
likely
to
be
a
manufacturer
of
cosmetics
or
a
publisher
of
comic
books,
as
a
builder
of
ships.
and
if
it
is
a
builder
of
ships,
a
builder
of
what
kind
of
ships?
nothing
in
the
indictment,
nothing
in
the
record
gives
us
the
answer.
the
lack
of
any
objective
standards
in
the
act
is
aggravated
also
by
the
denial
of
any
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
or
a
traditional
review
of
his
designations.
in
our
initial
brief
last
term,
we
showed
that
in
this
aspect,
the
act
violates
procedural
due
process.
i
think
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
any
kind
of
review
whatsoever
of
the
secretary's
determination.
but
even
if
that
were
to
become
possible
for
robel
to
secure
a
review
of
the
secretary's
determination
in
the
course
of
his
criminal
trial,
that
wouldn't
satisfy
constitutional
requirements.
under
the
yakus
case
and
other
decisions
of
this
court,
a
man
is
not
required
to
stake
his
liberty
as
a
price
of
testing
the
validity
of
an
administrative
determination.
he's
entitled
to
that
in
a
civil
suit
before
he
is
criminally
prosecuted.
so
i
say
the
absence
of
these
procedural
safeguards
as
we
showed
in
our
earlier
brief
is
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process.
but
is
also
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
delegation
to
the
secretary
oversteps
constitutional
limitations.
it
was
on
this
ground
for
example
the
absence
of
any
administrative
safeguards
that
the
court
in
the
schechter
case
distinguish
statutes
like
the
interstate
commerce,
federal
trade
commission
and
radio
commission
acts
from
the
code-making
provisions
of
the
nira
which
provided
for
no
administrative
safeguards
in
terms
of
hearings
and
judicial
review.
finally,
just
as
the
court
has
insisted
on
precision
of
regulation
in
statutes
that
infringed
basic
freedoms,
so
do
precision
as
required
in
delegations
of
authority
to
curtail
these
freedoms.
section
5
strikes
the
basic
freedoms
by
prohibiting
employment
to
persons
solely
because
of
their
political
association.
the
minimal
constitutional
requirement
i
suggest
of
such
a
statute
is
to
define
the
area
of
the
employments
that
may
be
prohibited
in
a
reasonably
specific
and
intelligible
fashion.
this
congress
has
not
done
it.
instead,
it
has
given
the
secretary
unfettered
authority
to
declare
almost
any
place
of
employment
off
limits
to
communists.
so
long
as
section
5
remains
on
the
statute
books,
every
member
of
the
communist
party,
no
matter
what
his
means
of
livelihood,
risks
waking
up
some
morning
to
discover
that
a
designation
by
the
secretary
has
subjected
him
to
a
possible
five-year
prison
sentence
merely
for
the
crime
of
reporting
to
work.
thus,
the
substance
of
over
breadth
of
section
5
that
i've
discussed
earlier
is
complimented
by
this
overbroad
delegation
of
authority.
each
accentuates
the
chilling
effect
of
the
other
on
freedom
of
association.
the
government
argues
that
any
initial
defect
in
the
delegation
to
the
secretary
was
secured
--
was
cured
by
the
1962
amendments
to
the
act
which
it
says
--
mr.
maroney
argued
a
few
moments
ago,
a
ratified
and
administrative
determination
interpretation
of
the
term
defense
facilities'
which
was
given
by
the
secretary
of
--
or
the
department
of
defense
in
hearing
some
of
the
amendments.
but
there
was
no
such
administrative
determination.
congress
was
merely
informed
that
the
defense
department
had
prepared
what
it
itself
described
as
a
tentative
list
of
the
facilities
to
be
designated,
which
of
course
was
not
binding
on
the
department
or
on
anybody
else.
and
there's
nothing
either
in
the
committee
hearings
or
reports
to
suggest
that
the
secretary
or
congress
regarded
this
tentative
list
as
delineating
the
categories
of
facilities
which
the
secretary
was
authorized
to
designate.
now,
mr.
maroney
in
his
argument
relied
i
take
it
heavily
if
not
almost
exclusively
on
the
decision
on
hirabayashi
to
sustain
the
delegation
in
this
case.
but
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
the
decision
in
that
case
in
retrospect,
i
submit
that
it's
perfectly
ridiculous
to
analogize
a
present
case
to
one
that
involved
the
wartime
authority
to
a
commanding
officer
to
cope
with
an
imminent
enemy
invasion
of
the
state
of
california.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
two
points
that
the
government
has
never
briefed
or
argued
in
this
case.
the
first
involves
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
that
the
indictment
is
defective
because
it
alleges
only
that
the
communist
party
has
been
ordered
to
register
as
a
communist
organization
but
not
that
the
party
is
in
fact
a
communist-action
organization.
the
government
omitted
the
latter
allegation
because
it
interprets
section
5
as
making
the
registration
order
against
the
party
conclusive
of
its
character
for
the
purpose
of
any
prosecutions
under
the
section.
this
interpretation
first
of
all
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
act.
the
introductory
clauses
both
of
section
5
and
of
section
5(a)(1)(d)
make
it
clear
that
they're
applicable
only
to
members
of
an
organization
which
both
is
a
communist-action
organization
and
which
has
been
ordered
to
register
as
such.
as
our
initial
brief
showed,
the
comparative
wording
of
other
sections
of
the
act
demonstrates
that
this
result
was
deliberate
on
the
part
of
congress
and
that
it
deliberately
required
proof
of
the
character
of
the
organization
in
the
criminal
proceeding
rather
than
making
the
finding
of
a
board
conclusive.
accordingly,
this
construction
of
section
5
is
required
both
by
the
rule
construction
of
the
criminal
statutes
and
is
also
required
by
three
constitutional
considerations
that
i'd
like
briefly
to
mention.
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
government's
construction
making
the
finding
of
a
board
conclusive
denies
appellee
procedural
due
process.
it
precludes
him
from
challenging
the
board's
1953
determination
that
the
communist
party
was
a
communist-action
organization
although
it
wasn't
a
party
to
the
proceeding
in
which
that
determination
was
made.
furthermore
and
perhaps
more
important,
it
precludes
him
from
challenging
the
current
validity
of
the
board's
determination
which
is
now
14
years
old
and
which
was
based
on
evidence
much
staler
than
that.
appellee
is
not
a
court
of
due
process
by
section
13
of
the
act
which
permits
a
registered
organization,
and
i
emphasize
both
words,
a
registered
organization,
to
make
periodic
application
to
the
board
for
a
re-determination
of
its
status
in
the
light
of
the
current
evidence.
this
procedure,
the
procedure
under
section
13
isn't
available
to
appellee
as
an
individual
since
it's
available
only
to
organizations
and
it
isn't
available
to
the
communist
party
which
has
not
registered
and
whose
refusal
to
register
has
now
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
communist
party
versus
united
states,
a
decision
which
the
government
has
accepted
holding
that
the
registration
order
against
the
party
is
hopelessly
at
odds
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
obviously,
appellee
can't
be
denied
his
constitutional
rights
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
board's
determination
because
the
officers
and
members
of
the
communist
party
have
elected
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights
not
to
register.
the
board's
--
the
government's
interpretation
also
makes
section
5
a
bill
of
attainder.
since
it
forecloses
appellee
from
litigating
the
current
character
or
the
current
validity
of
the
board's
1953
determination
against
the
party,
he
has
no
escape
from
the
effect
of
that
determination
upon
himself
even
though
the
determination
has
completely
lost
its
validity.
the
situation
under
the
government's
interpretation
would
be
the
same
as
though
the
communist
party
had
been
identified
by
name
in
the
statute
as
it
was
in
the
section
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
this
court
struck
down
in
united
states
versus
brown
on
the
grounds
of
the
bill
of
attainder.
the
third
constitutional
difficulty
with
the
government's
interpretation
is
that
it
deprives
appellee
of
the
rights
to
indictment
by
grand
jury,
trial
by
jury,
and
proof
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
so
because
section
5
may
not
constitutionally
be
enforced
unless
at
the
very
least
the
communist
party
has
the
characteristics
which
the
act
describes
to
a
communist-action
organization.
yet
under
the
government's
theory,
this
issue
of
fact
is
withdrawn
from
the
grand
jury
the
return
of
the
indictment,
from
the
petit
jury
that
were
prior
the
indictment,
and
to
top
it
off,
it
has
not
been
established
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
under
the
act
and
the
proceeding
before
the
board
only
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
surely,
this
court
which
has
recently
implemented
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused
in
so
many
other
situations
will
not
permit
three
of
his
most
basic
rights
to
be
circumvented
by
any
such
device.
the
last
point
i
will
argue
is
that
section
5
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
because
the
registration
order
against
the
communist
party
has
been
invalidated
by
facts
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
showing
that
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
of
the
act
does
not
exist.
the
communist
party
cannot
be
a
communist-action
organization
unless
there
is
a
world
communist
movement
that
meets
the
section
2
description.
this
is
so
because
section
3(3)
of
the
act
defines
a
communist-action
organization
as
an
agent
of
the
world
movement
described
in
section
2
and
obviously,
there
can
be
no
such
agent
if
there
is
no
principle.
section
2
describes
a
supposed
principle
as
a
worldwide
revolutionary
movement
not
led
by,
as
mr.
maroney
suggested
in
his
argument,
but
under
the
complete
direction,
domination,
control
and
discipline
of
the
communist
dictatorship
of
an
unnamed
foreign
power.
the
board
identified
this
power
in
1953
in
its
decision
as
a
soviet
union.
in
its
1961
decision
affirming
the
board's
order,
this
court
held
that
the
findings
of
section
2
concerning
the
nature
and
the
control
of
the
world
communist
movement
are
not
subject
to
proof
or
disproof
in
the
proceeding
before
the
board.
it
regarded
the
board's
identification
of
the
soviet
union
as
the
unnamed
foreign
power
referred
to
in
the
act
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
which
it
affirmed.
the
court
majority
opinion
recognized,
however,
that
future
events
might
invalidate
this
construction
and
that
the
time
might
come
when
in
the
words
of
the
opinion,
and
i
quote
them,
?the
board
or
a
reviewing
court
will
be
able
to
say
that
the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
the
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.
the
possibility
foreseen
by
the
court
is
now
materialized.
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
1950,
it's
common
knowledge
today
that
the
model
of
a
monolithic
world
communist
movement
under
soviet
control
bears
no
resemblance
to
contemporary
reality.
the
court
of
appeals
in
communist
party
versus
united
states
noted
this
fact.
it
pointed
out
that
the
soviet
union
can
only
regard
the
section
2
description
of
itself
as
a
bit
of
irony
and
that
the
assumptions
that
flow
from
such
a
description
have
long
since
been
discarded
as
a
basis
for
american
foreign
policy.
yet,
despite
these
views
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
think
are
self-evident,
for
the
reasons
i've
already
indicated,
neither
appellee
nor
the
communist
party
can
secure
consideration
by
the
board
of
the
proposition
that
its
registration
order
rests
on
a
manifestly
fictitious
premise,
nor
could
the
appellee
litigate
this
issue
in
its
criminal
trial
since
the
court,
this
court,
in
its
'61
decision
held
the
question
to
be
a
matter
for
statutory
construction.
i
submit,
therefore,
that
it's
incumbent
on
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
what
everybody
knows
the
fact
to
be
and
to
declare
in
the
words
of
your
1961
decision
that,
and
again
i
quote,
the
world
communist
movement
as
congress
meant
the
term
in
1950
no
longer
exists.
such
a
declaration
would
not
only
invalidate
section
5
but
would
have
the
host
of
effect
of
sweeping
away
the
other
tattered
remains
of
legislation
that
embodies
the
savage
and
irrational
anti-communism
of
a
period
that
has
been
so
destructive
both
of
constitutional
liberty
and
of
our
national
dignity.
thank
you.
