chief

earl
warren
did
the
defendant
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
act
eliminate
those
constitutional
problems
that
it
objective
to--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
lot
of
distinction
and
principle
between
this
case
and
the
cafeteria
case
where
the
woman
who
worked
there
for
years
in
the
cafeteria,
i
think
that
was
a
federal
facility.
but
she
worked
there
for
years
and
then
was
removed
because
it
was
said
that
she
had
a
security
risk
although
it
was
never
disposed
to
her
what
the
reason
was.
what
is
the
difference
in
principle
insofar
as
getting
rid
of
them
from
the
job?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
this
were
defied
but
was
a
federal
establishment,
we're
not
the
same
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
this
would
apply
to
any
federal
facility
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
absolute
discretion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
he
put
--
does
the
statute
for
any
limitations
of
any
kind
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
language
is
pretty
broad
that
the
term
“facility”
means
any
plant,
factory,
or
other
manufacturing,
producing
or
service
establishment,
airport,
airport
facility,
vessel,
pier,
water-front
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory,
station,
or
other
establishment
or
facility,
or
any
part,
division,
or
department
of
any
of
the
foregoing.
i
suppose
that
if
we
listed
everything
in
that
category,
you'd
have
the
major
part
of
our
economy,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
that
any
of
the
10,000
--
thousands
of
plants
in
this
country
that
produce
materials
for
the
government
and
there,
i
supposed
ten
to
thousands
of
them
that
where
within
the
act.
and
i
suppose
all
of
our
public
utilities
could
come
on
this.
and
it's
same
to
me
that
that
would
take
pretty
large
segment
of
our
whole
economy
that
the
secretary
could
with
some
unbridled
discretion
that
determine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
then
that
under
the
legislative
history,
this
in
accordance
with
the
legislative
history,
this
act
is
confined
to
these
five
categories
or
can
the
secretary
go
beyond
these?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
if
there
is
any
limitation
on
the
secretary
or
whether
he
can
declare
anything
at
any
place
for
their
any
goods
manufactured,
and
anything
of
that
kind,
or
any
utility
which
carries
these
products,
that
is
a
defense
operation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
crime
finds
out?
and
how
can
he
establish
in
a
criminal
trial
whether
the
secretary
of
defense
acted
within
his
discretion
or
beyond
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
any
proceeding
of
any
kind
just
he's
stated
it's
within.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
members
involved
in
those
plants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
read
somewhere
in
these
papers,
i
don't
know
where
that
these
orders
involved
about
three
million
men,
is
there
any,
i
read
that
someplace
else
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
don't
remember,
it's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
man
--
suppose
this
defendant,
this
petitioner
here
wanted
to
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
he
came
under
any
of
these
five
specifications
how
would
he
do
it
in
the
criminal
case?
what
was
the
burden
--
what
burden
would
be
applied
to
establish
that
he
didn't
come
within
any
of
these?
i
asked
that
question
because
you
yourself
have
such
difficulty
in
determining
what
section
it
comes
under.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
would
he
--
what
would
he
attack
here
if
he
have
to
attack
here
and
establish
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
this
started,
mr.
maroney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
belief
that
under
this
defense
program,
that
they
could
get
rid
of
mr.
robel
now
and
not
resort
to
the
criminal
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maroney
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
recommendation
in
the
committee
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
8,
united
states,
appellant,
versus
eugene
frank
robel.
we
will
start
the
argument
right
after
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
fact
that
that
was
a
wartime
measure
and
this
is
20
years
after
the
war
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
the
fact
that
that
was
a
civil
matter
and
this
a
criminal
matter
distinguish
cases
in
any
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
government
in
permitting
him
to
work
for
all
of
these
years
in
a
sensitive
facility
of
that
kind
and
at
the
same
time
try
to
punish
him
and
put
him
in
a
penitentiary
for
working
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
have
no
way
of
removing
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
those
other
cases
like
--
like
the
cafeteria
worker
in
a
defense
facility
that
the
woman
who
had
been
working
there
for
years
and
was
discharged
because
of
an
anonymous
letter
against
her.
they
found
a
way
to
get
rid
of
her.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
guess
there
was
a
case
--
suppose
you
had
gardner
out
on
the
small
branch
of
a
railroad
and
he
was
accused
of
being
a
communist
and
having
sought
employment
from
a
railroad
that
the
secretary
of
defense
has
declared
to
be
a
facility.
how
can
he
go
about
determining
whether
that
was
arbitrary
as
applied
to
him
or
not?
but
does
he
just
have
to
go
through
the
rear
and
become
convicted
and
come
to
the
supreme
court
declined
out
or
is
there
anyway
that
he
can
have
determine
whether
or
not
that
action
of
the
secretary
is
applied
to
him
as
arbitrary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
know
of
any
act
that
that
has
been
sustained
by
this
court
that
is
on
all
force
with
this
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
they
can
do
the
same
thing
in
time
of
peace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
familiar
with
the
philco
case
which
came
along
just
recently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maroney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
united

mr.

chief

did
the

of

but

what
is
the

in

insofar

chief

i
suppose
this
were
defied
but
was
a

we're
not
the

chief

earl
warren
you
don't
think
this
would
apply
to
any
federal
facility
here.
chief

earl
warren
absolute

chief
justice
earl
warren
does
he
put

does
the
statute
for
any

of
any

on

--
chief

his

i

that
if

in

you'd

wouldn't

chief

earl

i
beg
your

chief
justice
earl

well,
i
suppose
that
any
of
the
10,000
--
thousands
of
plants
in
this
country
that
produce
materials
for
the
government
and
there,
i
supposed
ten
to
thousands
of
them
that
where
within
the
act.
and
i
suppose
all
of
our
public
utilities
could
come
on
this.
and
it's
same
to
me
that
that
would
take
pretty
large
segment
of
our
whole
economy
that
the
secretary
could
with
some
unbridled
discretion
that
determine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
then
that
under
the
legislative
history,
this
in
accordance
with
the
legislative
history,
this
act
is
confined
to
these
five
categories
or
can
the
secretary
go
beyond
these?
chief

earl
warren
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
chief

--
is
if
there
is

any

which
carries
these
products,
that
is
a
defense
operation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
crime
finds
out?
and
how
can
he
establish
in
a
criminal
trial
whether
the
secretary
of
defense
acted
within
his
discretion
or
beyond
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
any
proceeding
of
any
kind
just
he's
stated
it's
within.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
members
involved
in

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
read
somewhere
in
these

i
don't
know
where
that
these
orders
involved
about
three
million
men,
is
there
any,
i
read
that
someplace
else
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
don't
remember,
it's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
man
--
suppose
this
defendant,
this

here
wanted
to
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
he
came
under
any

how
would

do
it

what

--
what
burden
would
be
applied
to
establish
that
he
didn't
come
within
any
of

i
asked
that
question
because
you
yourself
have
such
difficulty
in
determining
what
section
it
comes
under.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
would
he
--
what
would
he
attack
here
if
he
have
to
attack
here
and
establish
--
chief
justice

when
was
this
started,
