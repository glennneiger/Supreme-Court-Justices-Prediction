justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
person
otherwise
is
subject
to
the
statute
belongs
to
an
organization
that's
been
proved
from
picking,
picking
and
orienting
in
the
communist
group,
would
the
statute
cover?
i
wondered
about
that
as
i
look
at
the
language
in
that.
and
i
noticed
if
you
just
prospected
your
statement
of
the
soviet
union.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i've
seen
a
little
point
today
when
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
whether
or
not,
that
has
legal
or
constitutional
implications.
i
don't
know.
i
think
your
adversary
addresses
an
argument
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
question
might
be
raised
as
to
suppose
john
jones
belongs
to
moscow
dominated
communist
organization,
he's
subject
to
criminal
punishment
under
this
act.
and
joe
doug
belongs
to
a
chinese
communist;
a
peaking
a
communist
dominated
organization.
and
i
guess
he's
not
subject
to
criminal
penalties
under
the
act
of
law
to
at
least
argue
of
all
that
danger
exist
same
danger
except
to
the
standings,
that's
what
we
respect
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
i
--
am
i
correct,
i
think
i
recall
you
note
one
of
these
briefs
that
this
particular
fellow
had
been
working
at
a
shipyard,
the
same
shipyard
for
ten
years
before
the
criminal
proceeding
and
then
after
he
was
indicted,
he
went
back
and
he's
been
there
since
for
a
couple
of
years.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
there
some
procedure
by
which
he
can
be
removed
from
his
position?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
get
to
follow
like
this
under
the
statute
suppose
he's
a
saboteur,
he
can
be
indicted
then
he
goes
back
to
work
in
the
--
and
then
he
gets
out
on
bail,
and
goes
back
to
work
in
the
defense
plant
which
is
apparently
what
happened
here
and
he
continues
until
this
goes
through
the
courts.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean
1%
on
what
basis?
number
of
people
employed?
justice
abe
fortas
number
of
facilities.
justice
abe
fortas
number
of
census
establishments.
would
be
probably
be
a
lot
greater
in
terms
of
the
percentage
of
people
employed.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
could
congress
constitutionally
provide
that
secretary
of
defense
may
notify,
in
this
case,
a
shipyard
and
the
shipyards
shall
terminate
the
fellow
services
and
if
they
don't
then
there
would
be
some
penalty
on
the
shipyard?
justice
abe
fortas
it
bothers
me
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it
bothers
me
permanently,
and
at
the
moment
what
bothers
me
is
sort
of
anomaly
in
this
statute
that
it
doesn't
seem
really
to
go
the
evil
to
which
its
addressed.
let's
say
you
think
that
the
government's
subject
here
would
be
to
get
the
fellow
out
of
the
shipyard,
excepting
all
of
the
premises
and
have
his
employment
terminated
and
they
have
a
scheme
with
respect
to
classified
facilities
that
does
that.
but
here,
he
get
outside
of
the
category
of
classified
facilities
and
get
into
what
--
my
hypothesis
is
less
dangerous
or
less
sensitive
type
of
employment,
and
the
commerce
has
employed
a
criminal
sanction
instead
of
a
similar
administrative
sanction.
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
there
a
procedure
which
respect
to
government
employees
so
that
the
person
has
an
opportunity
to
get
out
of
the
government
once
he
--
once
--
doesn't
he
have
an
opportunity
to
know
the
government's
concern
about
as
being
an
employee
and
isn't
he
given
an
opportunity
to
get
out?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
suppose
--
suppose
he
thinks
he's
not
a
member,
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
always
as
easy
of
ascertainment
as
it
is
to
find
out
what
you
have
for
breakfast.
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
legislated
in
the
indictment
here?
justice
abe
fortas
not
only
that
he
was
a
member
but
that
he
knew
that
he
was
a
member
and
considered
himself
as
such?
justice
abe
fortas
thats
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
there
isn't
may
not
be
a
great
deal
in
difference
between
the
government's
point
of
view
and
the
point
of
view
of
the
district
court
here.
i
don't
know
whether
communist
party
still
issues
embossed
membership
certificates
or
whatever
it
is.
but,
as
to
that
i
suppose
a
knowledge
is
proved
--
then
we
would
have
to
prove
knowledge
of
communist
party
membership
by
showing
some
activities
on
the
private
fellow,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
different
is
that
from
what
district
court
here
said
you
have
to
do?
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
prosecutions
have
they
been?
justice
abe
fortas
so
which
one
is
it,
do
you
know?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
is
--
that
isn't
necessarily
so,
is
it
mr.
abt,
that
id
to
say
it's
conceivable
that
in
a
place
like
todd
shipyards
somebody
who
is
employed
in
a
non-sensitive
part
of
it
could
disrupt
the
activities
throughout
the
shipyard?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
feel
the
same
way
if
this
involved
picking?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
connection?
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
if
it
then
--
if
it
then
would
you
feell,
is
it
unreasonable
to
exclude
from
defense
facilities
persons
who
belong
to
organizations
supposedly
by
hypothesis
dominated
by
who
were
peaking
action
organization
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
suppose
instead
of
a
criminal
sanction
here,
the
--
and
all
of
these
procedures
this
doesn't
spell
down
in
the
act
then
it
handed
a
notification
to
the
employer
and
to
the
employee
that
the
man
is
no
longer
suitable
for
employment
and
the
employer
has
an
obligation
to
discharge
him.
would
that
cure
your
problems?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
that
instead
of
talking
about
the
communist
party
here,
you
were
targeting
that
the
society
to
blow
up
defense
facilities
of
the
united
states
and
its
so-called
and
that
there
is
a
finding
to
the
fact
that
that
was
in
truth
and
in
plan
and
purposes
as
the
organization.
now,
is
it
still
your
contention
that
such
a
case
the
person
concerned
will
have
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
and
prove
that
this
society
didn't
really
mean
what
it
said?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
by
this
extreme
example
that
it's
like
that
i
thought
a
few
moments
ago
you
we're
expressing
as
one
of
your
points
here
that
the
individual
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
determination
made
and
applied
in
this
case
as
to
the
purposes
and
character
of
the
communist
party.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
i
ask
you
the
in
the
case
of
the
society
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
up
to
the
defense
plants
would
you
say
that
the
structure
would
be
defective
unless
the
individual
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
everything?
justice
abe
fortas
and
even
if
that
were
--
even
if
the
sanction
were
a
civil
one
rather
than
it
is
termination
of
employment
rather
than
a
criminal
one.
justice
abe
fortas
where
--
this
is
a
nifty
business.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
supposed
as
a
cleared
variant
on
this,
we
were
talking
about
not
about
defense
facilities
in
general
but
about
top
secret
past
be
jobs
where
the
person
cannot
work
on
top
secret
classified
job
if
he
belongs
to
this
kind
of
a
society.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
apply
this
even
to
the
sanction
of
severing
the
person
from
the
top
secret
job.
justice
abe
fortas
that
makes
any
kind
of
a
security
system
very
difficult.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
supposed
(voice
overlap)
the
state?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
they've
been
able
to
litigate
those
very
well.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
follows
at
hand
and
then
he
--
the
government
later
thinks
he
ought
to
be
removed
for
the
reasons
we've
been
discussing,
do
you
believe
that
the
government's
without
power
to
device
any
kind
of
a
system
to
remove
him
without
proof
of
--
to
remove
them
on
the
basis
of
his
--
the
organizations
to
which
he
belongs?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
going
to
the
assumptions
you
want
to
about
findings
as
to
the
organization.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
my
--
the
organization
which
i've
referred
about
defense
installations.
justice
abe
fortas
you
may
get
it
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
point
that
let's
take
it
--
let's
assume
your
argument
is
correct
and
but
let's
assume
that
the
change
in
facts
is
that
they're
now
two
world
dominant
communist
organizations,
are
communist
governments
which
dominate
the
world
communist
movement,
does
that
make
any
difference
to
your
argument?
that
is
to
say
and
i
don't
personally
happen
to
know
of
any
facts
which
of
i
would
be
willing
to
take
notice
in
a
way
to
effect
that
there
is
no
communist
government
in
the
world.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
some
evidence
to
the
effect
that
there
are
now
two
powerful
communist
organizations
or
what
they
had
call
both
the
dominant
and
not
depends
upon
how
you
construe
the
word.
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
then
say
--
and
all
they
say
--
the
difference
that
it
makes
is
that
you
got
to
look
to
two
communist
governments
instead
of
one.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
from
the
department
of
defense?
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
committee?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
isn't
it
rather
strange,
if
that's
so,
that
it's
--
the
government
can
classify
it
as
a
defense
facility
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
law.
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
sort
of
anomalous
perhaps
that
the
ggovernment
--
this
is
not
a
sufficiently
sensitive
pose
so
that
the
government
can
compel
todd
shipyards
to
get
rid
of
him
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
sufficiently
sensitive
so
that
the
fellow
can
be
prosecuted
for
working
there.
it
sounds
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes,
but
the
latter
is
kind
of
important,
isn't
it?
but
as
you
said,
presumably
the
government
could
in
letting
these
defense
contracts
to
todd
shipyards
contract
for
clearance
for
individual
employees,
whether
or
not
they
are
working
on
any
specific
contract.
and
this
situation
seems
to
imply
the
government
is
afraid
that
this
mr.
robel
or
whatever
his
name
is,
is
a
danger
to
the
shipyard
as
a
whole,
including
those
parts
of
the
shipyard
that
are
engaged
in
the
defense
work.
it
seems
if
there
were
any
logic
in
this
situation
that
the
government
would
provide
in
the
contract
that
the
fellow
can't
work
there.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
is
this
fellow
for
whatever
reason
that
is
so
unimportant
that
he
doesn't
have
to
be
subjected
to
the
contractual
screening
process.
but
at
the
same
time,
it
is
so
important
that
we
can't
--
the
government
can't
allow
him
to
hold
his
job
without
being
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
is
that
what
it
comes
down
to?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
maroney,
may
i
ask
a
question.
i
think
i
ask
this
when
you
were
here
last
time.
i've
forgotten
what
the
answer
was.
suppose
mr.
robel
belonged
to
an
organization
that
says,
this
organization
is
substantially
directed,
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
communist
chinese
government.
would
that
be
within
the
scope
of
this
act
or
is
this
act
confined
to
organizations
dominated
or
controlled
by
the
soviet
union?
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
a
matter
of
what
it
worked
in
a
matter
of
its
language
too,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
world
communist
movement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
presumably,
nowadays,
it
would
not
include
those
organizations.
as
i
understand,
there
are
some
that
the
circuit
there
affiliated
with
china
and
not
with
the
soviet
union,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that
represents
the
legislative
judgment
that
one
is
more
dangerous
than
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
was
not
exploring
that.
i
hope
you
understand
what
i
was
exploring.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
the
restriction
of
this
act,
the
one
part
of
the
world
communist
movement.
that's
what
i
was
presenting
to
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
not
about
raising
a
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
what
i've
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
the
provision,
there
is
a
power
in
the
government
to
provide
in
contract
for
a
straining
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
i
was
not
suggesting
by
any
means,
mr.
abt,
that
the
government
can
get
together
in
todd
shipyards
and
say
you're
fired.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
are
talking
about
a
special
category,
which
is
a
category
arguably
of
people
employed
in
defense
facilities,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
keyishian
principle
applies
to
that
segment.
i
think
that
is
a
precise
issue
here.
it's
not
that
this
is
not
a
general
argument
or
whether
it
is
not
a
general
disqualification
or
a
general
statute
imposed
in
criminal
penalty
for
employment,
and
it's
not
a
certain
practical
employment
namely
employment
in
a
defense
facility.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
arguably,
this
is
a
more
discreet
statute
as
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
said
applied
to
--
which
they
did
not
apply
just
to
those
state
employees
who
were
in
the
defense
connected
state
work;
they're
not.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
was
not
the
issue
before
the
court
in
those
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
person
otherwise
is
subject
to
the
statute
belongs
to
an
organization
that's
been
proved
from
picking,
picking
and
orienting
in
the
communist
group,
would
the
statute
cover?
i
wondered
about
that
as
i
look
at
the
language
in
that.
and
i
noticed
if
you
just
prospected
your
statement
of
the
soviet
union.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i've
seen
a
little
point
today
when
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
whether
or
not,
that
has
legal
or
constitutional
implications.
i
don't
know.
i
think
your
adversary
addresses
an
argument
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
question
might
be
raised
as
to
suppose
john
jones
belongs
to
moscow
dominated
communist
organization,
he's
subject
to
criminal
punishment
under
this
act.
and
joe
doug
belongs
to
a
chinese
communist;
a
peaking
a
communist
dominated
organization.
and
i
guess
he's
not
subject
to
criminal
penalties
under
the
act
of
law
to
at
least
argue
of
all
that
danger
exist
same
danger
except
to
the
standings,
that's
what
we
respect
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
i
--
am
i
correct,
i
think
i
recall
you
note
one
of
these
briefs
that
this
particular
fellow
had
been
working
at
a
shipyard,
the
same
shipyard
for
ten
years
before
the
criminal
proceeding
and
then
after
he
was
indicted,
he
went
back
and
he's
been
there
since
for
a
couple
of
years.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
there
some
procedure
by
which
he
can
be
removed
from
his
position?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
get
to
follow
like
this
under
the
statute
suppose
he's
a
saboteur,
he
can
be
indicted
then
he
goes
back
to
work
in
the
--
and
then
he
gets
out
on
bail,
and
goes
back
to
work
in
the
defense
plant
which
is
apparently
what
happened
here
and
he
continues
until
this
goes
through
the
courts.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean
1%
on
what
basis?
number
of
people
employed?
justice
abe
fortas
number
of
facilities.
justice
abe
fortas
number
of
census
establishments.
would
be
probably
be
a
lot
greater
in
terms
of
the
percentage
of
people
employed.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
could
congress
constitutionally
provide
that
secretary
of
defense
may
notify,
in
this
case,
a
shipyard
and
the
shipyards
shall
terminate
the
fellow
services
and
if
they
don't
then
there
would
be
some
penalty
on
the
shipyard?
justice
abe
fortas
it
bothers
me
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it
bothers
me
permanently,
and
at
the
moment
what
bothers
me
is
sort
of
anomaly
in
this
statute
that
it
doesn't
seem
really
to
go
the
evil
to
which
its
addressed.
let's
say
you
think
that
the
government's
subject
here
would
be
to
get
the
fellow
out
of
the
shipyard,
excepting
all
of
the
premises
and
have
his
employment
terminated
and
they
have
a
scheme
with
respect
to
classified
facilities
that
does
that.
but
here,
he
get
outside
of
the
category
of
classified
facilities
and
get
into
what
--
my
hypothesis
is
less
dangerous
or
less
sensitive
type
of
employment,
and
the
commerce
has
employed
a
criminal
sanction
instead
of
a
similar
administrative
sanction.
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
there
a
procedure
which
respect
to
government
employees
so
that
the
person
has
an
opportunity
to
get
out
of
the
government
once
he
--
once
--
doesn't
he
have
an
opportunity
to
know
the
government's
concern
about
as
being
an
employee
and
isn't
he
given
an
opportunity
to
get
out?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
suppose
--
suppose
he
thinks
he's
not
a
member,
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
always
as
easy
of
ascertainment
as
it
is
to
find
out
what
you
have
for
breakfast.
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
legislated
in
the
indictment
here?
justice
abe
fortas
not
only
that
he
was
a
member
but
that
he
knew
that
he
was
a
member
and
considered
himself
as
such?
justice
abe
fortas
thats
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
there
isn't
may
not
be
a
great
deal
in
difference
between
the
government's
point
of
view
and
the
point
of
view
of
the
district
court
here.
i
don't
know
whether
communist
party
still
issues
embossed
membership
certificates
or
whatever
it
is.
but,
as
to
that
i
suppose
a
knowledge
is
proved
--
then
we
would
have
to
prove
knowledge
of
communist
party
membership
by
showing
some
activities
on
the
private
fellow,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
different
is
that
from
what
district
court
here
said
you
have
to
do?
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
prosecutions
have
they
been?
justice
abe
fortas
so
which
one
is
it,
do
you
know?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
is
--
that
isn't
necessarily
so,
is
it
mr.
abt,
that
id
to
say
it's
conceivable
that
in
a
place
like
todd
shipyards
somebody
who
is
employed
in
a
non-sensitive
part
of
it
could
disrupt
the
activities
throughout
the
shipyard?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
feel
the
same
way
if
this
involved
picking?
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
connection?
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
if
it
then
--
if
it
then
would
you
feell,
is
it
unreasonable
to
exclude
from
defense
facilities
persons
who
belong
to
organizations
supposedly
by
hypothesis
dominated
by
who
were
peaking
action
organization
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
suppose
instead
of
a
criminal
sanction
here,
the
--
and
all
of
these
procedures
this
doesn't
spell
down
in
the
act
then
it
handed
a
notification
to
the
employer
and
to
the
employee
that
the
man
is
no
longer
suitable
for
employment
and
the
employer
has
an
obligation
to
discharge
him.
would
that
cure
your
problems?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
that
instead
of
talking
about
the
communist
party
here,
you
were
targeting
that
the
society
to
blow
up
defense
facilities
of
the
united
states
and
its
so-called
and
that
there
is
a
finding
to
the
fact
that
that
was
in
truth
and
in
plan
and
purposes
as
the
organization.
now,
is
it
still
your
contention
that
such
a
case
the
person
concerned
will
have
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
and
prove
that
this
society
didn't
really
mean
what
it
said?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
by
this
extreme
example
that
it's
like
that
i
thought
a
few
moments
ago
you
we're
expressing
as
one
of
your
points
here
that
the
individual
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
determination
made
and
applied
in
this
case
as
to
the
purposes
and
character
of
the
communist
party.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
i
ask
you
the
in
the
case
of
the
society
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
up
to
the
defense
plants
would
you
say
that
the
structure
would
be
defective
unless
the
individual
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
everything?
justice
abe
fortas
and
even
if
that
were
--
even
if
the
sanction
were
a
civil
one
rather
than
it
is
termination
of
employment
rather
than
a
criminal
one.
justice
abe
fortas
where
--
this
is
a
nifty
business.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
supposed
as
a
cleared
variant
on
this,
we
were
talking
about
not
about
defense
facilities
in
general
but
about
top
secret
past
be
jobs
where
the
person
cannot
work
on
top
secret
classified
job
if
he
belongs
to
this
kind
of
a
society.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
apply
this
even
to
the
sanction
of
severing
the
person
from
the
top
secret
job.
justice
abe
fortas
that
makes
any
kind
of
a
security
system
very
difficult.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
supposed
(voice
overlap)
the
state?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
they've
been
able
to
litigate
those
very
well.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
follows
at
hand
and
then
he
--
the
government
later
thinks
he
ought
to
be
removed
for
the
reasons
we've
been
discussing,
do
you
believe
that
the
government's
without
power
to
device
any
kind
of
a
system
to
remove
him
without
proof
of
--
to
remove
them
on
the
basis
of
his
--
the
organizations
to
which
he
belongs?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
going
to
the
assumptions
you
want
to
about
findings
as
to
the
organization.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
take
my
--
the
organization
which
i've
referred
about
defense
installations.
justice
abe
fortas
you
may
get
it
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
point
that
let's
take
it
--
let's
assume
your
argument
is
correct
and
but
let's
assume
that
the
change
in
facts
is
that
they're
now
two
world
dominant
communist
organizations,
are
communist
governments
which
dominate
the
world
communist
movement,
does
that
make
any
difference
to
your
argument?
that
is
to
say
and
i
don't
personally
happen
to
know
of
any
facts
which
of
i
would
be
willing
to
take
notice
in
a
way
to
effect
that
there
is
no
communist
government
in
the
world.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
some
evidence
to
the
effect
that
there
are
now
two
powerful
communist
organizations
or
what
they
had
call
both
the
dominant
and
not
depends
upon
how
you
construe
the
word.
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
then
say
--
and
all
they
say
--
the
difference
that
it
makes
is
that
you
got
to
look
to
two
communist
governments
instead
of
one.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
from
the
department
of
defense?
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
committee?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
isn't
it
rather
strange,
if
that's
so,
that
it's
--
the
government
can
classify
it
as
a
defense
facility
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
law.
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
sort
of
anomalous
perhaps
that
the
ggovernment
--
this
is
not
a
sufficiently
sensitive
pose
so
that
the
government
can
compel
todd
shipyards
to
get
rid
of
him
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
sufficiently
sensitive
so
that
the
fellow
can
be
prosecuted
for
working
there.
it
sounds
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes,
but
the
latter
is
kind
of
important,
isn't
it?
but
as
you
said,
presumably
the
government
could
in
letting
these
defense
contracts
to
todd
shipyards
contract
for
clearance
for
individual
employees,
whether
or
not
they
are
working
on
any
specific
contract.
and
this
situation
seems
to
imply
the
government
is
afraid
that
this
mr.
robel
or
whatever
his
name
is,
is
a
danger
to
the
shipyard
as
a
whole,
including
those
parts
of
the
shipyard
that
are
engaged
in
the
defense
work.
it
seems
if
there
were
any
logic
in
this
situation
that
the
government
would
provide
in
the
contract
that
the
fellow
can't
work
there.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
is
this
fellow
for
whatever
reason
that
is
so
unimportant
that
he
doesn't
have
to
be
subjected
to
the
contractual
screening
process.
but
at
the
same
time,
it
is
so
important
that
we
can't
--
the
government
can't
allow
him
to
hold
his
job
without
being
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
is
that
what
it
comes
down
to?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
maroney,
may
i
ask
a
question.
i
think
i
ask
this
when
you
were
here
last
time.
i've
forgotten
what
the
answer
was.
suppose
mr.
robel
belonged
to
an
organization
that
says,
this
organization
is
substantially
directed,
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
communist
chinese
government.
would
that
be
within
the
scope
of
this
act
or
is
this
act
confined
to
organizations
dominated
or
controlled
by
the
soviet
union?
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
a
matter
of
what
it
worked
in
a
matter
of
its
language
too,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
world
communist
movement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
presumably,
nowadays,
it
would
not
include
those
organizations.
as
i
understand,
there
are
some
that
the
circuit
there
affiliated
with
china
and
not
with
the
soviet
union,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that
represents
the
legislative
judgment
that
one
is
more
dangerous
than
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
was
not
exploring
that.
i
hope
you
understand
what
i
was
exploring.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
the
restriction
of
this
act,
the
one
part
of
the
world
communist
movement.
that's
what
i
was
presenting
to
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
not
about
raising
a
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
what
i've
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
the
provision,
there
is
a
power
in
the
government
to
provide
in
contract
for
a
straining
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
i
was
not
suggesting
by
any
means,
mr.
abt,
that
the
government
can
get
together
in
todd
shipyards
and
say
you're
fired.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
are
talking
about
a
special
category,
which
is
a
category
arguably
of
people
employed
in
defense
facilities,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
keyishian
principle
applies
to
that
segment.
i
think
that
is
a
precise
issue
here.
it's
not
that
this
is
not
a
general
argument
or
whether
it
is
not
a
general
disqualification
or
a
general
statute
imposed
in
criminal
penalty
for
employment,
and
it's
not
a
certain
practical
employment
namely
employment
in
a
defense
facility.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
arguably,
this
is
a
more
discreet
statute
as
elfbrandt
and
keyishian
said
applied
to
--
which
they
did
not
apply
just
to
those
state
employees
who
were
in
the
defense
connected
state
work;
they're
not.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
was
not
the
issue
before
the
court
in
those
cases.
