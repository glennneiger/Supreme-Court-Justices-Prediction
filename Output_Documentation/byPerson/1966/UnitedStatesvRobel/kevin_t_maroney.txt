mr.

maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
which
arose
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
western
district
of
washington.
the
indictment
in
the
case
charged
the
appellee
with
unlawfully
from
november
1962
to
the
date
of
the
indictment,
engaging
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense,
while
at
the
same
time,
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
a
communist
action
organization.
the
defendant
having
knowledge
of
the
designation
of
the
defense
facility
and
also
having
knowledge
of
the
communist
parties
having
them
finally
found
to
be
a
communist
action
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
the
subversive
activities
control
act
of
1950.
i'm
going
to
the
statute
in
more
detail
in
a
moment.
on
appellees
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
the
trial
judge
relying
on
this
court's
opinions
in
the
scales
case,
noto
case,
brown
and
aptheker
held
that
in
order
for
the
statute
here
to
be
constitutional
which
post
grabs
of
course,
membership
in
the
party
while
concurrently
engaging
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
that
the
statute
would
have
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
require
active
membership,
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
organization,
and
specific
intent
to
bring
about
such
unlawful
purposes.
based
on
that
construction,
the
court
dismissed
the
indictment,
and
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
ninth
circuit.
subsequently
on
the
basis
of
the
direct
appeal
statute
and
following
our
unopposed
motion
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
court
certified
the
case
to
this
court.
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute,
the
subversive
activities
control
act
which
are
involved
in
the
appeal
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
3.
first
of
all
the
term
communist
action
organization
is
defined.
of
course,
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
the
definition
which
was
involved
in
the
communist
party
case.
the
term
“facility”
as
used
in
the
statute,
means
any
plant,
factory,
or
other
manufacturing,
producing,
or
service
establishment,
airport
facility,
vessel
pier,
waterfront
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory,
station,
or
other
establishments
or
facility,
or
any
part,
division
or
department
of
any
of
the
foregoing.
the
term
“defense
facility”,
as
defined
in
the
statute,
means
a
facility
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense,
pursuant
to
section
5
(d).
section
5
(d)
authorizes
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
facilities
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
which
he
finds
and
determines
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
the
application
of
the
provision
of
subsection
(a).
subsection
(a)
section
5
(a)
which
was
the
basis
for
the
indictment
in
this
case,
provides
that
when
a
communist
organization
is
registered
or
there
is
an
effect
to
final
order
of
the
board
requiring
registration.
it
shall
be
unlawful
in
the
particular
part
we're
here
concerned
with.
for
any
member
of
such
organization,
with
knowledge
or
a
notice
that
such
organization
is
so
registered
or
that
there
is
an
effect
to
final
order
of
the
board.
it's
unlawful
for
such
a
member,
subsection
(b),
if
such
organization
is
a
communist
action
organization
as
it
is
here,
to
engage
in
any
employment
in
any
defense
facility.
now,
i
might
also
point
out
before
going
further
that
the
section
5
(d),
as
it
was
originally
enacted
in
1950,
required
that
the
secretary
of
defense
promulgate
a
list
of
defense
facilities
which
had
been
designated
by
him
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
statute
of
course,
was
passed
in
1960.
this
section
did
not
become
operative,
meaningfully
operative
until
1961
when
the
final
--
when
the
order
against
the
communist
party
to
register
as
a
communist
action
organization
became
final.
after
that
order
did
become
final
in
october
1961,
the
defense
department
based
on
its
determination
that
the
publication
of
a
master
list
of
defense
facilities
would
be
very
highly
undesirable
since
such
a
master
list
of
our
strategic
and
vital
facilities
could
be
used
as
a
guidebook
for
sabotage
or
espionage
operations.
because
of
that
determination,
the
executive
branch
recommended
to
congress
and
congress
adopted
an
amendment
which
provided
the
procedure
which
is
contained
in
present
section
5
(d).
that
is
instead
of
a
publication
of
a
list
in
the
federal
register,
the
secretary
advises
the
defense
facility
and
there
is
the
requirement
that
such
determination
be
posted
conspicuously
in
the
defense
facility.
this
posting
requirement
is
contemplated
to
be
done
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
that
actual
notice
of
the
designation
and
of
the
status
of
the
communist
party
will
be
brought
home
to
each
employee.
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief
the
background
to
the
internal
security
act
and
the
concern
which
was
shown
by
congress
for
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
loyalty
security
procedures.
we
submit
that
the
manner
in
which
the
district
court
contrude
this
statute
defeats
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute.
as
construed
by
the
district
court
and
in
the
words
of
judge
wyzanski
in
the
vendor
case,
regards
the
arsenal,
only
against
those
and
who
satchels,
bombs
have
already
been
found.
we
submit
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
bar
those
whose
loyalty
is
in
doubt
and
not
those
of
proven
disloyalty.
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
existing
loyalty
security
program
was
really
presented
to
congress
when
it
was
considering
various
bills
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
internal
security
act
in
1950.
one
bill
which
was
submitted
and
being
considered
by
congress
would
have
imposed
penalties
on
any
federal
employee
or
person
employed
in
the
performance
of
any
national
defense
project,
who
became
or
remained
a
member
of
the
communist
party
while
so
employed,
or
a
member
of
any
other
organization
designated
by
the
attorney
general.
the
department
of
justice
opposed
that
legislation
on
the
basis
that
it
would
constitute
a
bill
of
attainder
that
the
bill
contained
no
legislative
findings,
and
in
any
event
that
the
existing
procedures
concerning
the
control
of
the
industrial
personal
security
program
were
adequate.
congress
met
the
first
two
objections
by
defining
the
class
more
narrowly
than
by
reference
to
the
communist
party
or
to
any
other
organization
designated
by
the
attorney
general,
defining
the
class
as
a
communist
action
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
in
addition,
the
bill
which
was
adopted
contained
extensive
legislative
findings
to
support
the
legislation.
so
that
despite
the
objections
voiced
by
the
department
of
justice
concerning
the
adequacy
of
existing
loyalty
security
procedures
in
the
industrial
security
field
congress
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
it
did
of
course
eliminate
the
bill
of
attainder,
your
honor.
and
also
it
did
meet
the
department's
objection
on
the
lack
of
legislative
findings.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
didn't
apply.
congress
did
not
use
or
did
not
make
it
applicable
to
members
of
the
communist
party
by
name
or
any
other
organization
thus
to
any
body
attorney
general.
it
made
it
applicable
to
members
of
a
communist
action
organization
within
a
meaning
of
the
statute.
of
course,
congress
set
forth
in
the
statute
the
general
definition
of
communist
action
organization
as
being
any
organization
within
the
united
states
that
is
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union,
the
leader
of
the
international
communist
movement,
and
which
is
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
international
communist
movement.
so
that
its
objective
standard
was
to
establish
as
to
what
is
a
communist
action
organization.
any
member
who
is
a
member
of
–
any
person
who
is
a
member
of
such
organization
is
under
the
section
disqualified
from
engaging
in
defense
facility
employment.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
subversive
activity's
control
board
in
making
its
findings
in
the
communist
party
case,
made
the
determination
that
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
international
communist
movement
which
is
referred
to
in
the
internal
security
act
is
in
fact
the
soviet
union.
this
court
in
reviewing
those
findings
agreed
that
it
was
the
soviet
union,
that
the
soviet
union
was
the
foreign
country
referred
to
in
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
not
cover,
i
think,
an
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
taking
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
of
course,
the
time
the
statute
was
passed;
it
was
only
one
clearly
defined
leader
of
the
international
communist
movement.
in
fact,
there
has
been
a
splintering,
i
think,
doesn't
affect
this
particular
statute,
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
there
should
also
be
coverage
in
another
area.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it
would
not
have
any
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
international
communist
movement
and
the
leadership
of
the
soviet
union,
i
think,
are
still
valid.
the
nature
of
a
communist
action
organization
in
this
case,
the
communist
party
and
its
ideological
attachment
and
control,
and
domination
by
that
foreign
dominated
conspiracy
is
still
as
valid
as
it
ever
was.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
because
congress
has
legislated
to
cure
--
i
think
it's
the
old
proposition
that
because
like
congress
they
legislated
to
cure
one
evil
and
possibly
has
not
covered
another
evil.
i
think
that
does
not
militate
against
the
validity
of
the
present
provision.
despite
the
disagreement
between
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branch,
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
then
existing
security
programs
as
i
indicated
earlier,
congress
was
of
the
contrary
view
and
clearly
intended
by
the
statute
to
extend
the
coverage
to
employees
of
defense
facilities.
now,
at
that
time
and
today
of
course,
there
is
an
industrial
personnel
security
program
which
does
cover
employees
of
private
contractors
who
are
working
on
classified
government
information
under
government
contract.
but
that
security
program
does
not
cover
or
did
not
cover
1950.
employees
of
important
defense
facilities
which
were
vital
to
our
defense
effort,
who
we're
not
engaged
in
working
on
government
contracts.
and
this
provision
was
designed
to
extend
the
security
program
to
cover
that
open
space.
certainly,
there
was
no
disagreement
between
the
executive
branch
and
the
legislative
branch
on
the
substantial
dangers
from
the
possibility
of
espionage
and
sabotage
wherein
members
of
communist
organizations
we're
concerned.
president
truman,
although
he
vetoed
the
entire
act
and
specifically
referred
to
this
section
in
his
veto
message
had
this
to
say
and
except
within
our
brief
of
page
24.
he
said
the
dangers
of
communism
come
not
from
normal
political
activity
but
from
espionage
and
sabotage
in
the
building
up
of
an
organization,
dedicated
to
the
destruction
of
our
government
by
violent
means.
the
president
in
his
veto
message
stated
that
this
bill
would
prohibit
the
employment
of
communism
defense
plans.
the
fact
is
that
it
would
be
years
before
this
goal
would
have
any
effect
of
this
nature,
if
it
ever
would.
fortunately
he
said,
this
subjective
is
already
being
substantially
achieved
under
the
present
procedures
of
the
department
f
defense.
in
subsequent
years,
the
defense
department
strongly
pointed
out
to
congress
the
dangers
in
these
important
and
vital,
and
strategic
facilities
of
persons
who
were
members
of
the
communist
movement.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
he's
still
employed.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
only
--
the
only
procedure
or
the
only
recourse
provided
for
by
congress
was
by
way
of
criminal
prosecution
in
the
event
the
person
maintains
his
defense
facility
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
of
course
this
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
in
the
cafeteria
workers
case
the
--
that
was,
your
honor
indicates
a
federal
facility
of
the
naval
base,
this
is
a
private
facility.
however,
deemed
by
the
secretary
of
defense
to
be
vital
to
our
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
this
--
i
think
other
security
programs,
i
don't
think
that
there
are
any
federal
establishments
that
by
designating
under
this
particular
section.
the
purpose
of
this
section
was
to
permit
the
secretary
to
designate
private
facilities.
there's
already
adequate
control
and
adequate
authority
for
controlling
federal
military
bases
and
other
sensitive
federal
bases.
and
in
a
federal
base,
i
think
that
under
the
cafeteria
workers'
decision,
there
could
be
an
absolute
bar
of
course.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
i
don't
think
this
statute
does
apply
to
a
federal
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
at
the
statute
vested
in
him,
the
discretion
to
make
the
determination
and
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
i
can
qualify
absolute
discretion
by
the
saying
that
i
assumed
that
a
defendant
in
a
case
such
as
this
could
defend
by
showing
a
clear
abusive
discretion
or
showing
mistake
but
not
i
think
quarrelling
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
determination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
statute
best
the
secretary
with
discretion
to
make
this
determination
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
has
to
make
the
determination.
in
addition
to
that
though,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
say
that
he
has
to
make
an
additional
determination
and
that
particular
facility
is
necessary
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
think
it's
unbridled
discretion,
your
honor.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
let
me
say
this,
that
the
secretary
has
in
point
of
fact
setup
five
categories
or
facilities
which
have
been
placed
on
the
list.
and
i
will
enumerate
those
in
a
moment.
but
i
think
that
it's
also
highly
relevant
that
those
five
categories
were
specified
and
were
before
congress
in
1962
at
the
time
of
the
amendment
of
section
5
(d),
so
that
congress
at
that
time
at
least
was
fully
appraised
and
approved
of
the
particular
right
categories
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
secretary.
and
those
were,
of
course,
considered
by
congress
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
in
fact,
passing
the
1962
amendment.
the
five
categories
are;
facilities
engaged
in
important
classified
military
projects.
this
is
page
27
--
they
are
set
forth
in
page
27
of
our
brief,
facilities
producing
important
weapon
systems,
sub-assemblies
and
their
components,
facilities
producing
essential
common
components,
intermediate
basic
materials,
and
raw
materials,
important
utility
and
service
facilities,
and
research
laboratories
whose
contributions
are
important
to
the
national
defense.
now,
the
department
of
defense
has
advised
us,
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief
that
less
than
1%
of
all
manufacturing
production
facilities
in
the
united
states
have
been
designated
under
this
program.
less
than
1%
of
the
utility
in
service
facilities
has
been
designated
under
this
program.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they
based
it
on
the
1%
of
the
number
of
facilities.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
total
number
of
facilities
in
the
united
states.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
ask
this
specific
question
of
the
department
of
defense
official
involved
in
this.
and
at
least,
it
was
his
view
that
there
would
not
be
a
greater,
tremendously
greater
disproportion
as
far
as
the
number
of
jobs
actually
involved.
because
on
this
list
there
are
small
facilities
and
there
are
very
large
facilities,
and
of
course,
eliminated
from
the
list,
or
not
on
the
list
at
all
are
likewise
many,
many
very
large
facilities.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
at
least
with
respect
to
these
five
categories,
there's
clear
indication
that
these
particular
types
of
facilities
are
intended
by
congress
to
be
embraced
by
the
statute
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
i
think
that
there
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
have
to
be
limited
by
being
found
to
be
unnecessary
to
our
security
here
from
a
defense
standpoint.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
he
has
a
rather
great
burden
to
show
that
he
was
acting
without
his
discretion
if
the
secretary
has
designated
a
particular
facility.
i
think
he
can
show
if
he
can
that
there
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion.
but
unless
he
can
do
that
then
i
think
that
the
determination
by
the
secretary,
if
it's
within,
certainly
if
it's
within
these
five
categories,
is
to
be
presumed
reasonable.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it's
broad,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
secretary
has
to
make
a
determination
that
these
are
facilities
in
which
are
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
it
would
embrace
everything.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
in
the
sabotage
statutes
themselves,
the
reference
to
war
materials,
things
which
are
conducive
to
being
used
in
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
said
sabotage
statute
themselves
are
broad
and
i
think
that
they
are
intended
to
protect
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
particular
installation
involved
in
this
case
is
the
todd
shipyards,
seattle
division.
it's
a
--
the
purpose
of
the
designation
in
the
todd
shipyards
situation
is
its
capacity
to
repair
and
to
build
ships
including
ships
on
navy
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
understand
in
'62
and
'63,
the
todd
shipyards
company
was
working
on
a
contract
to
build
two
guided
missile
destroyers.
of
course,
that
was
a
classified
project
and
those
two
ships
were
in
a
special
part
of
the
yard
where
if
the
person
did
not
have
access
for
classified
information,
he
could
not
get
into
the
piers
that
were
right
adjacent
to
those
ships
being
built
around
the
ships,
of
course.
but
the
other
part
of
the
yard
were
of
course,
any
employee
would
be
able
to
go
or
have
access
to
--
the
importance
of
that,
is
of
course,
the
ability
of
the
facility
to
carry
on
as
a
repair
yard
for
navy
vessels
and
to
build
navy
vessels.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
in
the
insulation
generally,
no,
sir.
but
there
is
a
--
i
understand
that
it
is
a
fenced
facility.
there
are
--
the
company
maintains
its
own
guards.
the
company
controls
ingress
and
egress
of
its
employees,
and
a
lot
of
persons
coming
in,
but
no
clearance
from
the
government
is
necessary.
now,
of
course,
that
wouldn't
be
true
with
respect
to
the
more
secured
area
at
the
time
these
missiles
destroyers
were
being
built.
that
particular
area
of
the
yard,
there
would
have
of
course,
have
to
be
an
access
clearance.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
don't
think
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
government
contract
involved.
although
of
course,
many
of
these
facilities
do
have
government
contracts.
one
of
them
for
example,
i
understand
is
a
producer
of
jet
engines.
however,
there
are
some
facilities
for
example
certain
facilities
in
niagara
mohawk
power
area.
some
of
those
facilities
which
are
being
vital
to
our
defense
posture
are
included
in
the
list.
and
of
course,
the
rationale
behind
that
is
that
if
certain
parts
of
those
facilities
could
be
not
down
of
course,
we
still
have
an
example
just
a
year
ago
where,
in
fact,
we
all
knew
of
new
england
was
not
that
of
power
worth
$24
or
$36.
so
the
facility
of
that
nature
is
designated
because
of
its
importance
not
only
from
standpoint
of
paralyzing
a
current
community,
but
possibly
having
an
adverse
effect
if
it
were
knocked
down
on
our
defense
communication
systems
and
radar
systems.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
figures,
i
think,
it's
approximately
3000.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
was
a
designation
that
was
made
shortly
after
october
1961
after
this
amendment,
the
list
was
began
to
be
prepared
at
about
the
time
the
decision
in
the
communist
party
case
was
coming
to
a
close.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
the
total
--
on
the
list
today
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
norm
since
1961
is
approximately
3000.
i
better
confirm
that
figure
and
i
would
advice
the
court
if
i'm
off
by
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute
requires
that
it
be
revised
periodically,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
there
may
have
been
some
change.
and
i
think
some
facilities
are
added
from
time
to
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
some
should
be
eliminatedfrom
time
to
time.
but
the
facilities
as
i
understand
that
which
are
on
this
list
--
it's
not
a
list
anymore
really
which
are
designated,
most
of
them
i
assume
for
the
foreseeable
future
will
remain
pretty
much
standard.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mohawk
power
and
airplane
manufacturing,
airplane
production,
shipyards,
important
overseas
communication
facilities,
and
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
industrial
personal
security
program?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
was
classified
information.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
if
it's
classified
information,
it's
part
of
the
contract
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
contractor
has
to
get
clearance
from
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
understand
they
did
do
'62
and
'63
when
they
were
building
those
two
guided
missiles.
where
they
did
that
day,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
was
working
in
the
facility
but
he
did
not
have
access
to
the
adjacent
area
to
these
two
destroyers.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
would
have
to
--
in
order
to
get
to
those
two
destroyers,
he
would
have
to
get
a
security
clearance
from
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
well,
as
i
say,
it's
1%,
approximately
it
could
be
two
or
two-and-a-half
or
three.
it's
a
2%
or
3%
of
the
total
workforce
in
this
kind
of
manufacturing
production
plants
and
utilities,
service
facilities,
laboratories,
and
so
forth.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
you
mean
the
designation
here
involved
three
million
men?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
really
wouldn't
be
sure,
your
honor,
if
i
could
try
to
find
from
the
defense
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
does
that
as
i
understand
under
the
private
yachts
but
it
does
do
general
repair
on
private
ships.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
i
indicated,
part
of
the
reason
for
the
designation
of
this
facility
is
not
so
much
--
or
not
certainly,
completely
that
it
was
working
on
two-guided
missile
destroyers
in
a
year
or
two.
it
is
the
capability
of
this
particular
yard
to
handle
in
an
emergency
situation
navy
ships
for
repair.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
if
it
had
special
facilities
for
repair
work,
which
would
be
--
in
other
words,
if
it
was
a
small
yard
that
couldn't
take
anything
but
a
cannon
cruiser
then
of
course
i
don't
think
that
would
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
yard?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
i
understand,
the
basis
of
the
designation
with
respect
to
this
yard,
that
is
true
your
honor,
that
it's
because
of
the
capability
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
of
this
yard,
to
do
--
to
handle
repair
work
which
would
be
essential
in
connection
with
our
naval
ships
in
an
emergency
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i'm
sure
the
fact
that
it
--
i
mean
if
it
were
used,
i
would
doubt
that
they
would
have
the
facilities
to
do
this.
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
theoretically,
i
think.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
five,
i
think
theoretically
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
if
a
shipyard
such
as
this
has
facilities
that
are
important
and
are
vital
or
would
be
vital
in
an
emergency
situation,
those
facilities
would
be
used,
time
to
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
guess
this
particular
one
would
--
or
at
least
going
far
at
this
time
would
come
within
the
one,
first
category.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
four?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
it
would
come
under
four,
no
(voice
overlap).
four,
is
subdivided
into
four
subcategories,
communications,
electric
power,
transportation
and
water
supply.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
possibly
there
would
be
four
that
would
be
a
justification
for
that
kind
of
determination,
certainly
one
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
there's
only
1%
of
both
utility
and
service
and
manufacturing
and
production
projects.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
--
i
think
he
would
--
these
five
categories,
i
think
there
are
clearly
ones
that
are
clearly
approved
by
congress.
and
now
i
think
he
could
defend
on
as
i
indicated
earlier,
if
he
could
show
or
make
it
show
to
the
court
that
the
placing
of
a
particular
facility
was
a
clear
views
of
discretion
and
wouldn't
come
within
any
of
the
possible
standards
for
the
secretary
of
defense
in
making
this
designation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
course
here
in
this
--
in
this
particular
instance,
since
the
statute
concerns
1962
and
1963,
of
course,
number
one,
it's
a
clear
support
for
the
designation
of
todd
shipyards
as
of
the
time
of
the
indictment
period
in
this
case.
you
know,
that
facility
was
engaged
that
time
in
a
classified
military
project
working
on
these
two
destroyers.
now,
the
district
court
relied
on
four
cases
to
make
the
determination
that
these
elements
of
activity
and
knowledge
of
unlawful
purposes
and
specific
intents
should
be
read
into
the
statute
in
order
to
hold
it
to
be
constitutional.
the
scales
case
and
noto
case
i
think
are
clearly
inapposite
since
they
--
those
were
prosecutions
which,
under
a
statute,
which
made
membership
in
an
organization
advocating
overthrow,
a
criminal
offense.
it
was
a
direct
prohibition
against
membership
in
such
organization.
and
since
it
was
a
direct
partial
abridgement
of
first
amendment
activities,
this
court
felt
it
reasonable
to
include
and
to
read
in
the
elements
of
activity
and
knowledge
of
unlawful
purposes
and
specific
intent.
here,
of
course,
it
is
not
congress'
desire
and
it
was
not
ongress'
purpose
in
passing
the
statute
to
punish
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
strictly
prophylactic
purpose,
and
it
punishes
only
the
combination
of
the
element
of
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization
while
at
the
same
time
being
an
employee
of
a
defense
facility.
and
in
that
respect,
we
think
that
it's
quite
similar
to
the
banking
act
provision
which
this
court
upheld
in
board
of
governors
v.
agnew
which
was,
of
course,
basically
a
conflict
of
interest
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it
might
be
able
constitutionally
to
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
it's
somewhat
similar
provision
with
respect
to
government
employment
is
provided
for
in
hijacks,
which
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
person.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
another
part
of
the
this
section
also
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
person
to
be
an
employee
of
the
government
while
at
the
same
time
being
a
member
of
an
organization
that
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
so.
but
i
think
he
has
the
same
opportunity
here.
this
statute
requires
that
he'd
be
put
on
notice
that
this
facility
has
been
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
and
that
notice
also
advises
him
that
the
communist
party
has
been
designated
as
a
communist-action
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
under
the
standards
of
membership
which
this
court
laid
down
in
killian.
of
course,
the
government
would
have
to
prove
--
will
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
considered
himself
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
as
of
the
time
that
he
was
also
an
employee
of
the
defense
facility.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
what
the
government,
in
a
trial
of
this
kind,
has
to
prove
that
the
man
himself
knew
that
he
was
member
of
the
communist
party
and
considered
himself
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
yes,
the
indictment
charges
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
charges
that
he
unlawfully
maintained
employment
while
at
the
same
time
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
as
far
what
the
government
has
to
show
in
the
file.
i
think
the
government
certainly
is
required
to
prove
that
the
man
knew
that
he
was
violating
the
statute.
he
had
to
know
that
this
was
a
defense
facility,
he
had
to
be
put
on
notice
in
that
effect,
he
get
to
be
put
on
notice
that
the
communist
party
had
been
designated
as
--
or
had
been
found
to
be
finally
a
communist-action
organization
and
that
he
himself
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
the
government
has
the
affirmative
burden
of
showing
every
one
of
those
elements.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
we
would
have
to
certainly
show
probably
attendance
of
meetings
or
maybe
payment
of
dues,
submitting
to
some
instructions
from
a
party,
carrying
out
instructions
from
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
think
for
example
that
we
are
obligated
as
a
district
court,
feels
that
we
would
have
to
--
in
order
to
have
the
statute
be
constitutional.
we
don't
feel
that
we're
obligated
to
show
by
evidence
of
--
thought
this
man's
own
activities
or
a
member's
own
activities
that
he
had
knowledge
through
those
activities
of
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
communist
party.
he
does
have
to,
of
course,
be
fully
aware
that
the
party
has
been
found
to
be,
after
a
board
proceeding,
a
communist-action
organization
and
therefore
as
being
an
organization
whose
objectives
may
not
be
wholly
lawful.
we
have
to
show
that.
we
don't
have
to
show
thru
his
--
i
mean,
in
other
words
we
wouldn't
have
to
have
to
show
that
they
attended
schools
where
they
talked,
where
they
discussed
marxism,
leninism,
and
so
forth.
we
don't
feel
that
we
have
to
show
that
he
had
this
specific
intent
to
bring
about
the
overthrow.
now,
in
a
particular
case,
in
the
course
proving
membership,
it
may
be
that
some
of
these
elements
would
also
be
justifiable
conclusions
from
the
activities
which
would
prove
membership.
but
our
point
is
that
that
affirmative
burden
of
proof
as
to
those
elements,
it
was
not
intended
by
congress
and
it
we
don't
think
are
appropriately
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
the
only
case.
this
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
may
of
1963
your
honor,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
subsequently
filed
and
the
district
court
held
its
decision
pending
this
court's
determination
of
the
archie
brown
case
and
the
aptheker
case.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
take
one
minute
and
possibly
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i
think,
scales
is
another
as
i
indicated,
i
don't
believe
apply
here
at
all,
aptheker
which
of
course
invalidated
the
section
6
provisions
of
the
same
act
relating
prohibition
of
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization
applying
for
using
a
passport.
i
think
an
important
difference
or
several
important
differences
between
this
situation
and
the
aptheker
situation
is,
first
of
all,
the
gravity
of
the
danger
that's
involved
here.
secondly,
in
aptheker,
the
court
is
construing
the
statute
on
its
face
held
that
only
constructive
notice
through
publication
the
federal
register
was
necessary
in
that
case.
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
individual
who
was
a
member
of
the
party
at
the
time
he
applied
for
passport
would
actually
have
knowledge
that
the
organization
had
been
designated
as
a
communist-action
organization.
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
different.
he
does
have
to
be
put
on
notice
that
the
organization
is
under
a
final
order
to
register.
the
sweep
of
the
statute
here
is
not
nearly
so
broad
as
it
was
in
aptheker.
aptheker
barred
all
travel,
by
all
members
of
the
communist
party
outside
the
western
hemisphere.
this
statute
of
course
affects
a
small
number
of
the
members
of
the
communist
party
and
it
affects
in
only
insofar
as
to
bar
him
from
working
in
1%
of
our
entire
manufacturing
plants.
the
archie
brown
of
course
which
the
district
court
also
relied
on,
i
think,
is
strictly
a
bill
of
attainder
decision
and
i
think
this
is
clearly
the
distinction.
i
like
to
save
a
few
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
in
connection
with
these
categories
under
the
delegation
of
authority.
the
five
categories
that
we
were
quoting
this
morning
were
from
the
defense
department's
release
that
was
made
at
the
time
these
listings
were
placed
into
effect.
the
similar
criteria,
frankly
identical
criteria
which
were
before
congress
are
set
forth
at
pages
443,
444
of
the
hearings
on
hr
9753
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
--
cited
in
our
brief.
there
are
very
slight
changes
of
a
few
phrases
for
example,
the
first
criteria
stated
to
congress
was
top
secret
projects,
facilities
engaged
in
top
secret
projects
and
then
it
was
explained
that
that
was
meant
to
include
top
secret,
secret
and
class
--
and
confidential
which
is
the
same
really
as
important
classified
military
projects.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
this
is
an
explanation
to
the
committee
as
part
of
the
defense
department
statement
that
a
tentative
list
had
been
prepared
which
fell
into
these
categories.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
to
the
committee,
yes.
now,
i
would
also
just
like
to
address
myself
for
a
minute
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
or
not
it
might
have
been
appropriate
or
let's
say
more
appropriate
for
congress
to
have
provided
that
a
government
agency
could
notify
an
employer
and
have
the
result
of
the
employee
being
dismissed.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
did
intend
the
statute
have
an
interim
effect.
the
purpose
of
course
was
to
get
these
people
who
insisted
on
remaining
members
of
the
communist-dominated,
foreign-dominated
group
out
of
these
places
where
in
an
emergency
situation
that
they
could
do
substantial
damage.
if
the
alternative
suggested
were
adopted,
the
person
who
is
then
a
member
of
an
organization
such
as
this
could
merely
continue
his
employment.
it
could
be
that
he
would
never
be
found
out
and
he
would
have
nothing
to
lose
by
doing
so.
this
way,
congress
really
puts
him
to
making
a
choice
of
either
remaining
in
the
organization
or
giving
up
his
defense
employment
for
the
purpose
of
getting
him
out
there
if
he
is
going
to
remain
associated
with
the
organization.
thank
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
which
is
here
for
reargument.
it
having
been
argued
but
not
decided
at
the
last
term.
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
western
district
of
washington
from
a
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
indictment
which
charged
that
the
appellee
unlawfully
from
november
1962
to
the
date
of
the
indictment
in
may
1963
was
engaged
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense
while
at
the
same
time
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
of
the
designation
as
a
defense
facility
of
the
todd
shipyard
where
he
was
employed,
and
also
with
knowledge
of
the
communist
parties
having
been
finally
ordered
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
the
court
will
also
recall
that
on
appellee's
motion
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
in
order
for
the
statute
under
which
the
indictment
was
brought
to
be
held
constitutional
within
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
scales,
newdow,
brown
and
aptheker.
the
government
would
have
to
plead
and
prove
that
the
defendant
was
an
active
member
of
the
party,
that
he
had
the
specific
intent
to
bring
about
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
he
had
knowledge,
personal
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party.
in
short,
the
district
court
held
that
the
government
would
have
to
plead
and
prove
what
amounts
to
a
smith
act
membership
case,
which
of
course
which
construction
of
the
statute
would
make
this
statute
a
complete
nullity.
the
government
of
course
in
the
lower
court
took
the
position
that
under
the
statute,
we
did
not
have
to
plead
or
prove
any
of
those
three
elements.
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
aptheker
was
one
of
the
four
cases
of
this
court
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
support
of
his
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
statute.
he
specifically
referred
to
and
relied
on
this
court's
decisions
in
scales,
newdow,
brown
and
aptheker.
so
that
aptheker
was
part
of
the
basis
for
the
district
judge's
decision.
now,
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix
on
our
brief
on
reargument
at
page
13.
section
3(3)
of
the
statute
of
course
defines
a
communist-action
organization,
which
the
court
is
familiar
with
that
definition,
as
being
an
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
and
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
soviet
union.
the
term
facility'
is
also
defined
in
the
statute
as
being
any
plant,
factory,
or
other
manufacturing,
producing
or
service
establishment,
airport,
airport
facility,
vessel,
pier,
waterfront
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory,
station
or
other
establishment
or
facility
or
any
part
thereof.
the
term
defense
facility'
means
any
facility
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense
pursuant
to
section
5(b).
now,
section
5
which
is
the
critical
part
of
the
statute
i
believe
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
this
morning,
today.
section
5(a)
says
that
when
a
communist
organization
is
registered
and
more
specifically
when
the
communist
organization
is
a
communist-action
organization,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
member
of
the
communist-action
organization
to
engage
in
an
employment
in
any
defense
facility.
subsection
b
of
that
same
section
authorizes
and
directs
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
facilities
as
defined
in
the
previous
--
the
earlier
section
3(7).
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
which,
he
finds
and
determines
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
the
application
of
the
provisions
of
subsection
a,
that
is
the
prohibition
against
engaging
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
by
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization.
in
setting
this
case
for
reargument,
this
court
asked
that
we
address
ourselves
specifically
to
an
additional
question
which
was
not
raised
by
the
parties
in
their
briefs.
and
that
additional
question
is
whether
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
defense
facilities
satisfies
pertinent
constitutional
standards.
now,
since
the
first
amendment
aspects
and
due
process
aspects
of
the
case
were
fully
argued
at
the
last
term
and
in
light
of
this
additional
question
having
been
raised
by
the
court,
i
intend
to
confine
my
argument
primarily
to
that
additional
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
designation
of
authority
or
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
defense.
briefly
stated,
the
constitutional
standards
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
proper
delegation
of
authority
by
the
legislature
are
(1)
the
establishment
by
the
legislature
of
a
legislative
policy
or
a
legislative
purpose,
and
(2)
the
setting
forth
in
the
statute
of
an
intelligible
principle
to
govern
the
implementation
of
that
legislative
policy.
a
long
line
of
cases,
including
the
hirabayashi
case
and
yakus,
lichter,
panama
refining,
a
number
of
other
cases
establishes
the
principle
that
when
congress
specifies
what
job
must
be
done,
who
is
to
do
it
and
what
is
the
scope
of
his
authority,
that
is
a
permissible
delegation
by
the
legislation.
thus,
in
yakus,
this
court
sustained
the
power
of
the
administrator
to
fix
prices
of
commodities
which
in
his
judgment
would
be
fair
and
equitable
and
would
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act,
the
purposes
of
the
act
being
to
prevent
inflation
and
that
type
of
general
statement
of
purpose.
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
the
act
in
question
there
authorized
the
military
--
a
military
commander
to
prescribe
military
areas
from
which
persons
could
be
excluded
whenever
he
deems
such
action
necessary.
of
course,
in
hirabayashi,
the
court
was
sustaining
a
conviction
of
a
citizen
of
japanese
ancestry
for
violation
of
a
curfew
imposed
by
the
military
commander
in
the
pacific
coast
areas
adjacent
--
pacific
areas
adjacent
to
the
coast.
and
the
court,
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
the
--
considering
what
congress
was
doing
in
enacting
this
statute
said
that
the
court
was
--
or
that
the
congress
was
ratifying
the
executive
order
which
had
been
issued
by
the
president
and
which
conferred
authority
on
military
commanders
to
establish
these
areas,
the
security
areas,
the
purpose
being
of
course
to
safeguard
military
resources
against
sabotage.
and
this
court
in
the
hirabayashi
case
held
that
considering
the
purpose
of
congress
and
the
legislative
history
which
indicated
that
curfew
orders
were
among
the
things
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
legislation,
that
there
was
no
unconstitutional
delegation
of
authority.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
insofar
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
or
the
restriction
that
was
promulgated
by
the
military
commander,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
as
far
as
the
question
is
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
made
a
lawful
delegation
of
authority.
i
think
that
remains
the
same
whether
it's
wartime
or
peacetime.
of
course,
the
restrictions
which
were
imposed
by
the
military
commander
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
that
is
a
curfew
of
all
citizens
of
japanese
ancestry
from
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
until
six
in
the
morning
of
going
out
upon
the
street
in
a
city
of
course
was
much
more
drastic
and
obviously,
i
think
that
depended
on
the
existence
of
an
extreme
emergency
such
as
was
present
in
the
pacific
coast
in
1942.
similarly
in
the
lichter
case
which
involved
the
renegotiation
act
which
had
been
passed
by
congress
authorizing
i
think
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
navy
to
initiate
action
to
recover
excess
profits
and
in
determining
whether
or
not
congress
had
laid
down
a
sufficiently
specific
legislative
purpose.
the
court
looked
to
the
administrative
interpretations
of
excess
profits
as
enunciated
i
believe
by
some
criteria
laid
down
by
the
navy
department
and
which
were
before
the
congress
when
it
made
some
amendments
in
1942
or
1943.
and
the
court
held
that
since
congress
was
aware
of
this
administrative
implementation
of
the
statute
and
enacted
the
amendments
that
this
was
a
sufficient
statement
by
the
congress
--
expression
by
the
congress
of
the
legislative
policy
and
purpose.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
there
is
some
distinction,
your
honor.
in
a
case
such
as
that,
the
renegotiation
act
case
or
a
price
--
fixing
of
minimum
prices
and
minimal
wages,
there
is
some
distinction
in
that
there
is
an
order
after
an
administrative
hearing
directed
at
the
individual
who
is
affected
so
that
to
a
certain
extent,
i
believe
there
is
a
greater
latitude
that
has
been
shown
by
this
court
in
that
type
of
case
as
far
as
to
the
specificity
of
the
legislative
purpose.
and
i
think
that's
abundantly
clear
in
the
--
for
example,
in
the
federal
communication
statutes,
regulatory
statutes
of
that
kind
where
the
standard
is
just
and
reasonable
rates
or
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
so
forth.
this
of
course
--
this
statute,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
main
brief
and
submitted
to
the
court
last
term
is
an
exercise
of
the
war
power
and
it
would
--
i
would
think
that
as
for
example
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
where
the
court
has
held
that
a
broad
discretion
must
be
allowed
to
the
president,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
a
case
since
it
does
involve
the
war
power
that
a
broad
discretion
should
be
allowed
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
however,
i
think
there's
no
need
in
this
particular
case
for
the
court
to
have
to
consider
the
grant
of
a
broad
discretion
without
identifiable
guidelines
because
i
think
that
this
statute
in
its
--
on
the
face
of
it
and
certainly
in
light
of
its
legislative
history
makes
it
abundantly
clear
exactly
what
it
was.
that
was
the
authority
conferred
on
the
secretary
of
defense.
i
think
it's
well
within
the
limitations
that
this
court
has
required
for
delegation
of
this
kind.
congress
here
in
section
5(a)
has
said
that
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization,
it's
unlawful
for
a
member
of
the
communist-action
organization
to
be
employed
in
a
defense
facility.
the
only
thing
that
has
been
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
defense
is
a
determination
by
him
based
on
the
facts
available
to
him
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
facility
is
a
defense
facility.
the
--
now,
the
criteria
that
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
which
he
must
use,
must
follow
is
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
that
a
particular
facility
be
designated
as
a
defense
facility.
now,
the
appellee
contends
that
this
is
a
--
is
an
unduly
vague
criterion,
the
security
of
the
united
states.
they
say
it's
not
susceptible
of
a
definition
which
would
confine
in
any
way
the
secretary
of
defense.
a
somewhat
similar
problem
of
defining
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
determining
the
connotation
of
that
phrase
was
faced
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
involving
scarbeck,
irvin
scarbeck,
a
former
employee
of
the
state
department
who
had
turned
over
classified
information
to
an
agent
of
the
polish
government.
he
was
--
he
was
charged
and
convicted
with
violating
section
4
of
the
same
act,
the
internal
security
act.
section
4
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
an
officer
or
an
employee
of
the
united
states
to
furnish
to
a
representative
of
a
foreign
government
information
that
has
been
classified
as
affecting
the
security
of
the
united
states.
the
information
which
he
turned
over
had
been
classified
as
defense
information
under
executive
order
10501
of
the
president.
he
said
they're
totally
different.
information
classified
as
defense
information
doesn't
bring
it
within
the
purview
of
this
statute
which
prohibits
turning
over
information
affecting
the
security
of
the
united
states.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
scarbeck
properly
held,
we
think,
as
follows.
they
say
appellant
has
not
undertaken
to
show
that
defense
information
as
described
in
the
executive
order
is
not
a
necessity
information
affecting
the
security
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
section
7(a)(3)(b)
which
is
section
4
of
this
statute.
common
sense
tells
us
that
it
is.
defense
is
one
aspect
of
security
and
indeed,
in
their
broad
senses,
the
two
terms
have
a
very
similar
connotation.
the
legislative
history
as
we
have
seen
shows
that
congress
must
have
equated
the
two
terms
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
statute
and
the
intent
of
congress
in
utilizing
this
language
as
equating
national
defense
with
security.
now,
i
think
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
that
is
exactly
what
congress
was
doing.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
still
is
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
prophylactic.
it's
to
remove
from
a
sensitive
position
a
person
who
is
currently
and
continuously
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
obviously,
i
think
it
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
communist
party
or
the
international
communist
movement
to
continuously
have
incidents
of
sabotage
other
than
when
they
might
deem
them
to
be
valuable.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
a
considerable
period
of
time,
at
least
10.
mr.
abt
may
be
able
to
--
within
my
understanding
is
he's
been
a
long
time
employee
of
the
shipyard.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
the
only
statute
by
which
the
government
can
exercise
any
control
over
his
employment
at
todd
shipyard.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
he's
not
employee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
your
honor,
in
the
cafeteria
workers
case,
that
was
a
government
installation.
it
was
a
navy
yard.
here,
todd
shipyards
is
a
private
shipyard.
the
government
does
not
operate
it.
the
government
has
no
supervision
over
it
at
all
other
than
in
the
performance
of
specific
government
contracts,
for
example,
the
building
of
ships
and
other
than
as
to
the
possible
applicability
now
of
this
statute.
but
other
than
that
--
in
other
words,
there's
no
security
program
as
such
for
this
type
of
facility
except
insofar
as
an
employee
of
the
facility
might
be
working
on
a
classified
government
contract.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
sensitive,
your
honor.
but
the
only
authority
that
the
government
--
that
the
executive
has
to
take
any
action
is
authority
which
would
be
conferred
on
it
by
congress
or
which
it
would
get
by
virtue
of
a
contract
with
the
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
contracts
which
are
issued
by
the
defense
department
under
the
industrial
security
program
do
provide
for
screening
clearances
to
be
approved
by
the
military
departments
in
connection
with
employees
who
are
to
be
given
access
to
classified
information.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
i
think
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this,
your
honor,
there
is
at
present
time
employee
security
programs
for
the
government
as
the
court
is
well
aware
for
the
industrial
personnel
security
program
which
involves
access
to
classified
information.
congress
in
passing
this
statute
said
there's
a
loophole.
we
need
some
kind
of
a
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
from
pages
12
to
29
of
our
brief
last
term,
the
testimony
before
the
committees
which
were
considering
these
bills
and
had
been
for
a
number
of
years
prior,
representatives
of
the
department
of
defense,
the
president
in
his
veto
message
indicated
there
was
a
desirability
to
cover
this
particular
area.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
couldn't
have
taken
the
position
that
the
existing
security
programs
covered
this
situation
because
they
just
don't
as
a
factual
matter.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
was
a
bill
before
the
committee
before
this
section
was
finally
decided
on
which
would
have
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
an
employee
of
a
defense
contractor
to
become
a
member
of
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
no,
i
think
it's
specifically
mentioned
in
the
communist
party.
the
department
of
justice
objected
to
the
enactment
of
that
bill
on
the
basis
first
that
it
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder
as
specifically
naming
the
communist
party.
and
congress
--
oh,
and
also,
there
were
no
legislative
findings.
now,
in
enacting
this
section,
congress
of
course
removed
the
mention
of
the
communist
party,
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
definition
to
include
members
of
communist-action
organizations
and
also
made
extensive
legislative
findings
as
to
the
necessity
for
this
legislation,
and
of
its
concern
that
defense
facilities
be
protected,
must
be
protected
from
the
dangers
of
sabotage.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
is
there
anywhere
a
designation?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
and
i
think
that
the
only
place
where
there
could
be
any
review
at
all
of
the
administrator's
designation
of
a
particular
facility
would
be
in
connection
with
a
criminal
case
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
with
respect
to
his
discretion
from
a
factual
standpoint
as
to
whether
this
is
or
isn't
a
vital
defense
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
would
only
have
a
defense
if
the
court
would
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
particular
facility
involved
could
not
be
a
defense
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
the
statute
of
course
conveys
on
the
secretary
the
discretion
as
i
think
it
properly
should.
i
mean
obviously,
there
are
factors
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
that
he
has
knowledge,
that
it
has
been
so
designated
by
the
secretary
and
that
he
has
knowledge
that
the
communist
party
is
under
a
final
order
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
they
may
not
be
hard.
i
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
is
the
end
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
unless
the
court
could
determine
that
it
had
no
relationship,
that
the
designation
had
no
relationship
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
the
designation
of
a
shipyard
by
the
secretary
of
defense
pursuant
to
the
statute
is
the
kind
of
binding
determination
that
the
congress
has
given
to
the
secretary.
it's
a
similar
authority
which
was
given
to
the
military
commanders
in
the
hirabayashi
case
to
take
whatever
action
was
necessary
to
protect
military
resources
and
the
argument
or
there
was
a
discussion
by
the
court
that
what
he
did
was
rationally
connected
with
protection
against
sabotage.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
his
concern
?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
it
had
a
relation
to
the
national
defense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
they
all
have
to
be
limit
by
the
phrase,
the
secretary
determines
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
require
protection
against
sabotage.
now,
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
and
i
think
that
that's
completely
consistent
with
the
hirabayashi
case.
and
the
court
in
the
hirabayashi
didn't
say,
well,
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
is
not
reasonable.
maybe
it
should
have
been
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
that
the
curfew
should
have
started.
what
the
court
did
decide
was
that
the
regulation
that
the
military
commander
did
impose
at
a
rational
connection
with
the
purposes
that
congress
have
in
legislating
protection
against
sabotage,
protection
of
war
resources.
since
the
court
made
that
determination
when
the
basis
of
the
facts
known
to
it,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
question
of
challenging
the
judgment
of
the
military
commander
or
as
to
whether
or
not
another
judgment
would
have
placed
a
different
time
limit
or
different
areas
to
be
involved
in
the
so-called
military
areas
and
as
i
started
to
mention
a
few
minutes
ago
in
connection
with
that
very
problem
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
pointed
out
that
where
the
orders
under
the
present
act
have
some
relation
to
a
protection
against
espionage
and
against
sabotage,
our
test
is
at
an
end.
that
is
that
the
court
should
not
undertake
to
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
to
--
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
regulation
of
the
military
command.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
confined
to
organizations
dominated
by
the
soviet
union
as
a
matter
of
legislative
construction
as
enunciated
by
this
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
literally
says,
the
foreign
government
which
is
the
leader
of
international
communist
movement
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
this
court
held
that
to
be
the
soviet
union
as
a
matter
of
legislative
construction.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
if
an
organization
were
dominated
by
the
communist
chinese
government
and
not
by
the
soviet
government
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir.
i
just
don't
think
that
the
situation
that
exists
today
had
crystallized
at
the
time
of
the
legislative
findings
in
1950.
on
the
other
hand,
i
certainly
disagree
with
the
contention
which
the
appellee
tries
to
make
out
of
that
change
in
situation
that
this
completely
nullify
the
fact
that
we
now
have
a
communist
chinese
and
possibly
their
own
small
orbit
communist
nations
that
completely
nullifies
all
the
findings
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
that
there
no
longer
is
an
international
communist
movement
led
by
the
soviet
union
and
i
just
think
that
factually,
that's
completely
erroneous.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
i
understand
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
i
would
not
cover
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
not
cover
the
hypothetical
situation
that
your
honor
raises.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
free
from
governmental
interference
anyway.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
unreasonable
government
interference.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
the
issue,
your
honor,
but
to
say
it's
unreviewable,
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it's
not
reviewable
as
to
whether
or
not
his
discretion
should
be
substituted
for.
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
except
on
the
grounds
that
the
designation
might
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
think
that's
the
only
ground
that
it
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
to
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
capricious.
i
think
that
could
be
reviewed,
yes.
but
i
think
that
once
it
appears
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
is
in
the
statute
but
i
think
it's
a
similar
standard
for
review
which
the
court
was
using
in
hirabayashi
but
once
it
appears
from
the
circumstances
that
it
has
--
that
the
designation
has
a
relationship
to
national
defense
that
it
has
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
he
could
make
the
contention
and
the
court
could
undertake
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
this
was
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
designation.
now,
i
certainly
think
that
once
it
appears
to
the
--
once
the
court
is
apprised
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
shipyard
that
it
has
some
relationship
on
the
face
of
things
to
national
defense
and
i
think
the
court
is
not
entitled
to
undertake
an
investigation
as
to
whether
or
not
this
secretary's
judgment
should
be
substituted
for.
in
that
respect,
i
think
it's
no
different
than
many
statutes.
for
example,
under
the
price
--
the
regulation
of
commodity
prices,
suppose
that
the
administrator
decided
that
a
loaf
of
bread
should
cost
$0.26
and
no
more.
well,
certainly,
the
court
is
not
entitled
to
undertake
a
de
novo
review
of
whether
or
not
that's
a
good
judgment
by
the
administrator
and
decide
that
it
should
have
been
$0.28
or
$0.27
or
$0.23
because
this
was
a
discretion
that
was
conferred
on
him
by
the
congress.
and
as
long
as
--
what
he
does
is
in
effectuation
of
the
congressional
policy
in
purpose
in
enacting
the
statute,
he
has
an
authority
to
do
it.
now,
moreover,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that's
involved
in
this
case
and
especially
in
connection
with
the
1962
amendments,
your
honors
will
recall
that
the
statute
in
1950
and
originally,
it
required
the
secretary
of
defense
to
prepare
a
list
of
defense
facilities
and
such
list
was
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register.
when
the
order
against
the
communist
party
became
final
in
1961,
the
secretary
was
confronted
for
the
first
time
with
the
necessity
of
implementing
the
statute.
he
did
prepare
a
list
of
defense
facilities
and
it
was
perfectly
apparent
in
1961
as
it
had
been
to
president
truman
in
1950
on
the
point
--
one
of
the
points
in
which
he
vetoed
the
bill
that
the
publication
of
federal
register
of
a
list
of
those
defense
facilities
would
be
providing
a
guidebook
for
sabotage.
it
would
be
providing
a
list
of
military
targets,
and
for
that
reason,
the
defense
department
went
back
to
congress
and
ask
for
an
amendment
to
the
statute
eliminating
the
necessity
of
publication
in
the
federal
register.
at
that
time
in
1962,
when
congress
had
these
amendments
under
consideration,
the
secretary
of
defense
advised
the
congress
of
five
specific
criteria
which
he
was
using
in
implementing
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
but
insofar
as
a
designation
would
come
within
these
five,
it
would
certainly
be
within
the
authority
conferred
on
him.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
limitation
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
a
facility
that
the
interest
of
national
defense
requires
protection
against
sabotage.
i
think,
that's
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
know
where
designation
like
this
could
be
reviewed
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
or
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
the
list
that
was
originally
provided
for
when
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress,
that
the
publication
of
this
list
would
be
bad
from
a
national
defense
standpoint,
i
think
highlights
the
fact
that
there
should
not
be
review.
that
congress
did
do
not
intend
to
review
of
the
underlying
rationale.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
there
could
be,
your
honor.
it
could
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
there
is
your
honor
anyway
for
him
to
challenge
the
merits
unless
it
should
appear
to
the
court
and
then
say,
i
have
to
quote
that
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
you
always
do.
but
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
conferred
on
the
secretary,
i
don't
think
it
is
reviewable.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
hirabayashi.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
hirabayashi
is
on
all
force
with
this.
and
hirabayashi
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
delegation
and
also
on
reviewability.
i
think
it's
the
same
thing
with
hirabayashi.
there
was
no
reviewability
there
as
to
whether
the
military
commander's
determination
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
as
long
as
there
is
rational
connection
then
i
think
the
court's
duty
has
come
to
an
end.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
certainly,
the
right
to
go
out
in
the
street
in
the
evening
after
eight
o'clock
at
night
and
before
six
in
the
morning.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
so.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
mean
i
--
for
example,
i
think
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
down
the
street.
now,
it
can
be
reasonably
infringed.
if
there
is
a
fire,
they
can
detour
us
around
the
block
but
absent
some
lawful
and
proper
governmental
interest,
we
do
have
a
right
to
walk
down
the
street
to
come
out
of
our
houses,
to
go
abroad
and
the
city.
in
hirabayashi,
because
of
the
agencies
of
the
war
situation,
because
of
the
judgment
made
by
the
military
commander
as
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation,
he
imposed
a
curfew
on
citizens
of
japanese
ancestor
and
citizens
i
think
of
possibly
germany
ancestry,
i
don't
know.
but
japanese
ancestry
was
involved.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
but
that's
only
because
it's
a
more
stringent
thing
that
was
done.
i
think
what
was
done
in
hirabayashi
is
much
more
stringent
than
what
is
being
done
here.
in
the
first
place,
a
person
of
japanese
ancestry
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
once
1941
or
42
came.
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization
who
wants
to
continue
employment
in
a
defense
facility,
he
can
do
something
about
it.
he
can
get
out
of
the
organization
at
least
or
he
can
find
another
job
but
so
that
what
was
resorted
to
in
hirabayashi
is
much
more
detrimental,
it
seems
to
me,
than
what
is
resorted
to
by
congress
here.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
that's
being
accomplished
here
is
no
different
and
if
congress
--
pardon
me,
have
set
up
a
screening
program
for
all
persons
who
are
employed
in
defense
facilities.
the
same
is
done
by
the
military
under
the
industrial
personnel
security
program.
and
certainly,
if
a
member
of
the
communist
party
having
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
been
found
to
be
and
is
under
a
final
order
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization
and
has
been
found
to
be
after
extensive
administrative
proceedings,
an
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
and
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
soviet
union
and
he
applied
for
a
clearance
under
a
screening
program
with
the
intention
of
continuing
in
the
party,
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
deny
him
a
clearance
on
that
basis
not
because
his
loyalty
or
his
lack
of
loyalty
has
been
demonstrated
but
because
it's
in
doubt.
and
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
where
a
national
defense
is
the
ultimate
objective.
it
does
not
require
us
to
take
a
chance
on
persons
who
knowingly
continue
as
members
in
a
foreign
dominated
organization.
thank
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
want
to
take
a
minute
in
connection
with
justice
brennan's
questions
concerning
the
scope
of
possible
review
at
the
criminal
trial.
in
our
--
in
a
footnote
on
page
2
of
our
brief
on
reargument,
we
point
out
or
make
the
contention
that
to
the
extent
that
the
appellee
is
entitled
to
show
that
the
findings
of
the
secretary
are
so
bereft
of
factual
support
that
they
provide
no
rational
basis
for
the
enforcement
of
the
act
citing
carolene
products
case.
the
question
presented
would
be
one
for
the
judge
to
decide
on
motion
rather
than
an
issue
for
the
jury
citing
fox
v.
united
states.
and
we
submit
that
that
would
be
the
standard
of
review
which
would
be
available
to
the
defendant
as
a
legal
contention.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
there
is.
the
legislative
history
would
indicate,
at
least
as
far
as
the
committee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it's
always
reviewable
for
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
determination,
your
honor.
i
hope
i'm
not
giving
away
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
that
--
i
figured
--
i
simply
read
to
provide
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
doubt
it.
i
would
not
think
that
congress
for
example
could
confer
authority
on
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch
which
would
include
the
making
of
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
determination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
right.
and
just
the
one
other
point
then
in
connection
with
the
point
raised
by
justice
fortas
concerning
the
possibility
as
i
understand
it
of
including
in
a
provision,
a
contractual
provision
which
the
government
might
have
with
a
facility
of
this
type
as
for
a
screening
of
other
employees
who
would
not
be
given
access
or
were
not
applying
for
access
to
classified
information.
i
might
just
point
out
in
connection
with
that
that
of
course
all
of
the
facilities
which
are
designated
by
the
secretary
and
which
the
statute
contemplates
should
be
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense
are
not
facilities
which
have
contracts
with
the
government.
for
example,
power
stations
may
be
supplying
power
to
an
aircraft
corporation
which
is
performing
a
government
contract.
because
of
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
which
arose
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
western
district
of
washington.
the
indictment
in
the
case
charged
the
appellee
with
unlawfully
from
november
1962
to
the
date
of
the
indictment,
engaging
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense,
while
at
the
same
time,
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
a
communist
action
organization.
the
defendant
having
knowledge
of
the
designation
of
the
defense
facility
and
also
having
knowledge
of
the
communist
parties
having
them
finally
found
to
be
a
communist
action
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
the
subversive
activities
control
act
of
1950.
i'm
going
to
the
statute
in
more
detail
in
a
moment.
on
appellees
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
the
trial
judge
relying
on
this
court's
opinions
in
the
scales
case,
noto
case,
brown
and
aptheker
held
that
in
order
for
the
statute
here
to
be
constitutional
which
post
grabs
of
course,
membership
in
the
party
while
concurrently
engaging
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
that
the
statute
would
have
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
require
active
membership,
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
organization,
and
specific
intent
to
bring
about
such
unlawful
purposes.
based
on
that
construction,
the
court
dismissed
the
indictment,
and
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
ninth
circuit.
subsequently
on
the
basis
of
the
direct
appeal
statute
and
following
our
unopposed
motion
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
court
certified
the
case
to
this
court.
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute,
the
subversive
activities
control
act
which
are
involved
in
the
appeal
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
3.
first
of
all
the
term
communist
action
organization
is
defined.
of
course,
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
the
definition
which
was
involved
in
the
communist
party
case.
the
term
“facility”
as
used
in
the
statute,
means
any
plant,
factory,
or
other
manufacturing,
producing,
or
service
establishment,
airport
facility,
vessel
pier,
waterfront
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory,
station,
or
other
establishments
or
facility,
or
any
part,
division
or
department
of
any
of
the
foregoing.
the
term
“defense
facility”,
as
defined
in
the
statute,
means
a
facility
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense,
pursuant
to
section
5
(d).
section
5
(d)
authorizes
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
facilities
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
which
he
finds
and
determines
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
the
application
of
the
provision
of
subsection
(a).
subsection
(a)
section
5
(a)
which
was
the
basis
for
the
indictment
in
this
case,
provides
that
when
a
communist
organization
is
registered
or
there
is
an
effect
to
final
order
of
the
board
requiring
registration.
it
shall
be
unlawful
in
the
particular
part
we're
here
concerned
with.
for
any
member
of
such
organization,
with
knowledge
or
a
notice
that
such
organization
is
so
registered
or
that
there
is
an
effect
to
final
order
of
the
board.
it's
unlawful
for
such
a
member,
subsection
(b),
if
such
organization
is
a
communist
action
organization
as
it
is
here,
to
engage
in
any
employment
in
any
defense
facility.
now,
i
might
also
point
out
before
going
further
that
the
section
5
(d),
as
it
was
originally
enacted
in
1950,
required
that
the
secretary
of
defense
promulgate
a
list
of
defense
facilities
which
had
been
designated
by
him
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
statute
of
course,
was
passed
in
1960.
this
section
did
not
become
operative,
meaningfully
operative
until
1961
when
the
final
--
when
the
order
against
the
communist
party
to
register
as
a
communist
action
organization
became
final.
after
that
order
did
become
final
in
october
1961,
the
defense
department
based
on
its
determination
that
the
publication
of
a
master
list
of
defense
facilities
would
be
very
highly
undesirable
since
such
a
master
list
of
our
strategic
and
vital
facilities
could
be
used
as
a
guidebook
for
sabotage
or
espionage
operations.
because
of
that
determination,
the
executive
branch
recommended
to
congress
and
congress
adopted
an
amendment
which
provided
the
procedure
which
is
contained
in
present
section
5
(d).
that
is
instead
of
a
publication
of
a
list
in
the
federal
register,
the
secretary
advises
the
defense
facility
and
there
is
the
requirement
that
such
determination
be
posted
conspicuously
in
the
defense
facility.
this
posting
requirement
is
contemplated
to
be
done
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
that
actual
notice
of
the
designation
and
of
the
status
of
the
communist
party
will
be
brought
home
to
each
employee.
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief
the
background
to
the
internal
security
act
and
the
concern
which
was
shown
by
congress
for
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
loyalty
security
procedures.
we
submit
that
the
manner
in
which
the
district
court
contrude
this
statute
defeats
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute.
as
construed
by
the
district
court
and
in
the
words
of
judge
wyzanski
in
the
vendor
case,
regards
the
arsenal,
only
against
those
and
who
satchels,
bombs
have
already
been
found.
we
submit
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
bar
those
whose
loyalty
is
in
doubt
and
not
those
of
proven
disloyalty.
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
existing
loyalty
security
program
was
really
presented
to
congress
when
it
was
considering
various
bills
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
internal
security
act
in
1950.
one
bill
which
was
submitted
and
being
considered
by
congress
would
have
imposed
penalties
on
any
federal
employee
or
person
employed
in
the
performance
of
any
national
defense
project,
who
became
or
remained
a
member
of
the
communist
party
while
so
employed,
or
a
member
of
any
other
organization
designated
by
the
attorney
general.
the
department
of
justice
opposed
that
legislation
on
the
basis
that
it
would
constitute
a
bill
of
attainder
that
the
bill
contained
no
legislative
findings,
and
in
any
event
that
the
existing
procedures
concerning
the
control
of
the
industrial
personal
security
program
were
adequate.
congress
met
the
first
two
objections
by
defining
the
class
more
narrowly
than
by
reference
to
the
communist
party
or
to
any
other
organization
designated
by
the
attorney
general,
defining
the
class
as
a
communist
action
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
in
addition,
the
bill
which
was
adopted
contained
extensive
legislative
findings
to
support
the
legislation.
so
that
despite
the
objections
voiced
by
the
department
of
justice
concerning
the
adequacy
of
existing
loyalty
security
procedures
in
the
industrial
security
field
congress
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
it
did
of
course
eliminate
the
bill
of
attainder,
your
honor.
and
also
it
did
meet
the
department's
objection
on
the
lack
of
legislative
findings.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
didn't
apply.
congress
did
not
use
or
did
not
make
it
applicable
to
members
of
the
communist
party
by
name
or
any
other
organization
thus
to
any
body
attorney
general.
it
made
it
applicable
to
members
of
a
communist
action
organization
within
a
meaning
of
the
statute.
of
course,
congress
set
forth
in
the
statute
the
general
definition
of
communist
action
organization
as
being
any
organization
within
the
united
states
that
is
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union,
the
leader
of
the
international
communist
movement,
and
which
is
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
international
communist
movement.
so
that
its
objective
standard
was
to
establish
as
to
what
is
a
communist
action
organization.
any
member
who
is
a
member
of
–
any
person
who
is
a
member
of
such
organization
is
under
the
section
disqualified
from
engaging
in
defense
facility
employment.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
subversive
activity's
control
board
in
making
its
findings
in
the
communist
party
case,
made
the
determination
that
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
international
communist
movement
which
is
referred
to
in
the
internal
security
act
is
in
fact
the
soviet
union.
this
court
in
reviewing
those
findings
agreed
that
it
was
the
soviet
union,
that
the
soviet
union
was
the
foreign
country
referred
to
in
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
not
cover,
i
think,
an
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
taking
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
of
course,
the
time
the
statute
was
passed;
it
was
only
one
clearly
defined
leader
of
the
international
communist
movement.
in
fact,
there
has
been
a
splintering,
i
think,
doesn't
affect
this
particular
statute,
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
there
should
also
be
coverage
in
another
area.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it
would
not
have
any
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
international
communist
movement
and
the
leadership
of
the
soviet
union,
i
think,
are
still
valid.
the
nature
of
a
communist
action
organization
in
this
case,
the
communist
party
and
its
ideological
attachment
and
control,
and
domination
by
that
foreign
dominated
conspiracy
is
still
as
valid
as
it
ever
was.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
because
congress
has
legislated
to
cure
--
i
think
it's
the
old
proposition
that
because
like
congress
they
legislated
to
cure
one
evil
and
possibly
has
not
covered
another
evil.
i
think
that
does
not
militate
against
the
validity
of
the
present
provision.
despite
the
disagreement
between
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branch,
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
then
existing
security
programs
as
i
indicated
earlier,
congress
was
of
the
contrary
view
and
clearly
intended
by
the
statute
to
extend
the
coverage
to
employees
of
defense
facilities.
now,
at
that
time
and
today
of
course,
there
is
an
industrial
personnel
security
program
which
does
cover
employees
of
private
contractors
who
are
working
on
classified
government
information
under
government
contract.
but
that
security
program
does
not

president
truman,
although
he
vetoed
the
entire
act
and
specifically
referred
to
this
section
in
his
veto
message
had
this
to
say
and
except
within
our
brief
of
page
24.
he
said
the
dangers
of
communism
come
not
from
normal
political
activity
but
from
espionage
and
sabotage
in
the
building
up
of
an
organization,
dedicated
to
the
destruction
of

by
violent
means.
the
president
in
his
veto
message
stated
that
this
bill
would
prohibit
the
employment
of
communism
defense
plans.
the
fact
is
that
it
would
be
years
before
this
goal
would
have
any
effect
of
this
nature,
if
it
ever
would.
fortunately
he
said,
this
subjective
is
already
being
substantially
achieved
under
the
present
procedures
of
the
department
f
defense.
in
subsequent
years,
the
defense
department
strongly
pointed
out
to
congress
the
dangers
in
these
important
and
vital,
and
strategic
facilities
of
persons
who
were
members
of
the
communist
movement.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
he's
still
employed.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
only
--
the
only
procedure
or
the
only
recourse
provided
for
by
congress
was
by
way
of
criminal
prosecution
in
the
event
the
person
maintains
his
defense
facility
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
of
course
this
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
in
the
cafeteria
workers
case
the
--
that
was,
your
honor
indicates
a
federal
facility
of
the
naval
base,
this
is
a
private
facility.
however,
deemed
by
the
secretary
of
defense
to
be
vital
to
our
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
this
--
i
think
other
security
programs,
i
don't
think
that
there
are
any
federal
establishments
that
by
designating
under
this
particular
section.
the
purpose
of
this
section
was
to
permit
the
secretary
to
designate
private
facilities.
there's
already
adequate
control
and
adequate
authority
for
controlling
federal
military
bases
and
other
sensitive
federal
bases.
and
in
a
federal
base,
i
think
that
under
the
cafeteria
workers'
decision,
there
could
be
an
absolute
bar
of
course.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
i
don't
think
this
statute
does
apply
to
a
federal
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
at
the
statute
vested
in
him,
the
discretion
to
make
the
determination
and
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
i
can
qualify
absolute
discretion
by
the
saying
that
i
assumed
that
a
defendant
in
a
case
such
as
this
could
defend
by
showing
a
clear
abusive
discretion
or
showing
mistake
but
not
i
think
quarrelling
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
determination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
statute
best
the
secretary
with
discretion
to
make
this
determination
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
has
to
make
the
determination.
in
addition
to
that
though,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
say
that
he
has
to
make
an
additional
determination
and
that
particular
facility
is
necessary
to
the
security
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
think
it's
unbridled
discretion,
your
honor.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
let
me
say
this,
that
the
secretary
has
in
point
of
fact
setup
five
categories
or
facilities
which
have
been
placed
on
the
list.
and
i
will
enumerate
those
in
a
moment.
but
i
think
that
it's
also
highly
relevant
that
those
five
categories
were
specified
and
were
before
congress
in
1962
at
the
time
of
the
amendment
of
section
5
(d),
so
that
congress
at
that
time
at
least
was
fully
appraised
and
approved
of
the
particular
right
categories
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
secretary.
and
those
were,
of
course,
considered
by
congress
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
in
fact,
passing
the
1962
amendment.
the
five
categories
are;
facilities
engaged
in
important
classified
military
projects.
this
is
page
27
--
they
are
set
forth
in
page
27
of
our
brief,
facilities
producing
important
weapon
systems,
sub-assemblies
and
their
components,
facilities
producing
essential
common
components,
intermediate
basic
materials,
and
raw
materials,
important
utility
and
service
facilities,
and
research
laboratories
whose
contributions
are
important
to
the
national
defense.
now,
the
department
of
defense
has
advised
us,
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief
that
less
than
1%
of
all
manufacturing
production
facilities
in
the
united
states
have
been
designated
under
this
program.
less
than
1%
of
the
utility
in
service
facilities
has
been
designated
under
this
program.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they
based
it
on
the
1%
of
the
number
of
facilities.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
total
number
of
facilities
in
the
united
states.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
ask
this
specific
question
of
the
department
of
defense
official
involved
in
this.
and
at
least,
it
was
his
view
that
there
would
not
be
a
greater,
tremendously
greater
disproportion
as
far
as
the
number
of
jobs
actually
involved.
because
on
this
list
there
are
small
facilities
and
there
are
very
large
facilities,
and
of
course,
eliminated
from
the
list,
or
not
on
the
list
at
all
are
likewise
many,
many
very
large
facilities.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
at
least
with
respect
to
these
five
categories,
there's
clear
indication
that
these
particular
types
of
facilities
are
intended
by
congress
to
be
embraced
by
the
statute
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
i
think
that
there
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
have
to
be
limited
by
being
found
to
be
unnecessary
to
our
security
here
from
a
defense
standpoint.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
he
has
a
rather
great
burden
to
show
that
he
was
acting
without
his
discretion
if
the
secretary
has
designated
a
particular
facility.
i
think
he
can
show
if
he
can
that
there
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion.
but
unless
he
can
do
that
then
i
think
that
the
determination
by
the
secretary,
if
it's
within,
certainly
if
it's
within
these
five
categories,
is
to
be
presumed
reasonable.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it's
broad,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
secretary
has
to
make
a
determination
that
these
are
facilities
in
which
are
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
it
would
embrace
everything.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
in
the
sabotage
statutes
themselves,
the
reference
to
war
materials,
things
which
are
conducive
to
being
used
in
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
said
sabotage
statute
themselves
are
broad
and
i
think
that
they
are
intended
to
protect
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
particular
installation
involved
in
this
case
is
the
todd
shipyards,
seattle
division.
it's
a
--
the
purpose
of
the
designation
in
the
todd
shipyards
situation
is
its
capacity
to
repair
and
to
build
ships
including
ships
on
navy
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
understand
in
'62
and
'63,
the
todd
shipyards
company
was
working
on
a
contract
to
build
two
guided
missile
destroyers.
of
course,
that
was
a
classified
project
and
those
two
ships
were
in
a
special
part
of
the
yard
where
if
the
person
did
not
have
access
for
classified
information,
he
could
not
get
into
the
piers
that
were
right
adjacent
to
those
ships
being
built
around
the
ships,
of
course.
but
the
other
part
of
the
yard
were
of
course,
any
employee
would
be
able
to
go
or
have
access
to
--
the
importance
of
that,
is
of
course,
the
ability
of
the
facility
to
carry
on
as
a
repair
yard
for
navy
vessels
and
to
build
navy
vessels.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
in
the
insulation
generally,
no,
sir.
but
there
is
a
--
i
understand
that
it
is
a
fenced
facility.
there
are
--
the
company
maintains
its
own
guards.
the
company
controls
ingress
and
egress
of
its
employees,
and
a
lot
of
persons
coming
in,
but
no
clearance
from
the
government
is
necessary.
now,
of
course,
that
wouldn't
be
true
with
respect
to
the
more
secured
area
at
the
time
these
missiles
destroyers
were
being
built.
that
particular
area
of
the
yard,
there
would
have
of
course,
have
to
be
an
access
clearance.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
don't
think
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
government
contract
involved.
although
of
course,
many
of
these
facilities
do
have
government
contracts.
one
of
them
for
example,
i
understand
is
a
producer
of
jet
engines.
however,
there
are
some
facilities
for
example
certain
facilities
in
niagara
mohawk
power
area.
some
of
those
facilities
which
are
being
vital
to
our
defense
posture
are
included
in
the
list.
and
of
course,
the
rationale
behind
that
is
that
if
certain
parts
of
those
facilities
could
be
not
down
of
course,
we
still
have
an
example
just
a
year
ago
where,
in
fact,
we
all
knew
of
new
england
was
not
that
of
power
worth
$24
or
$36.
so
the
facility
of
that
nature
is
designated
because
of
its
importance
not
only
from
standpoint
of
paralyzing
a
current
community,
but
possibly
having
an
adverse
effect
if
it
were
knocked
down
on
our
defense
communication
systems
and
radar
systems.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
figures,
i
think,
it's
approximately
3000.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
was
a
designation
that
was
made
shortly
after
october
1961
after
this
amendment,
the
list
was
began
to
be
prepared
at
about
the
time
the
decision
in
the
communist
party
case
was
coming
to
a
close.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
the
total
--
on
the
list
today
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
norm
since
1961
is
approximately
3000.
i
better
confirm
that
figure
and
i
would
advice
the
court
if
i'm
off
by
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute
requires
that
it
be
revised
periodically,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
there
may
have
been
some
change.
and
i
think
some
facilities
are
added
from
time
to
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
some
should
be
eliminatedfrom
time
to
time.
but
the
facilities
as
i
understand
that
which
are
on
this
list
--
it's
not
a
list
anymore
really
which
are
designated,
most
of
them
i
assume
for
the
foreseeable
future
will
remain
pretty
much
standard.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mohawk
power
and
airplane
manufacturing,
airplane
production,
shipyards,
important
overseas
communication
facilities,
and
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
industrial
personal
security
program?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
was
classified
information.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
if
it's
classified
information,
it's
part
of
the
contract
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
contractor
has
to
get
clearance
from
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
understand
they
did
do
'62
and
'63
when
they
were
building
those
two
guided
missiles.
where
they
did
that
day,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
was
working
in
the
facility
but
he
did
not
have
access
to
the
adjacent
area
to
these
two
destroyers.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
would
have
to
--
in
order
to
get
to
those
two
destroyers,
he
would
have
to
get
a
security
clearance
from
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
well,
as
i
say,
it's
1%,
approximately
it
could
be
two
or
two-and-a-half
or
three.
it's
a
2%
or
3%
of
the
total
workforce
in
this
kind
of
manufacturing
production
plants
and
utilities,
service
facilities,
laboratories,
and
so
forth.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
you
mean
the
designation
here
involved
three
million
men?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
really
wouldn't
be
sure,
your
honor,
if
i
could
try
to
find
from
the
defense
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
does
that
as
i
understand
under
the
private
yachts
but
it
does
do
general
repair
on
private
ships.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
i
indicated,
part
of
the
reason
for
the
designation
of
this
facility
is
not
so
much
--
or
not
certainly,
completely
that
it
was
working
on
two-guided
missile
destroyers
in
a
year
or
two.
it
is
the
capability
of
this
particular
yard
to
handle
in
an
emergency
situation
navy
ships
for
repair.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
if
it
had
special
facilities
for
repair
work,
which
would
be
--
in
other
words,
if
it
was
a
small
yard
that
couldn't
take
anything
but
a
cannon
cruiser
then
of
course
i
don't
think
that
would
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
yard?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
i
understand,
the
basis
of
the
designation
with
respect
to
this
yard,
that
is
true
your
honor,
that
it's
because
of
the
capability
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
of
this
yard,
to
do
--
to
handle
repair
work
which
would
be
essential
in
connection
with
our
naval
ships
in
an
emergency
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i'm
sure
the
fact
that
it
--
i
mean
if
it
were
used,
i
would
doubt
that
they
would
have
the
facilities
to
do
this.
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
theoretically,
i
think.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
five,
i
think
theoretically
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
if
a
shipyard
such
as
this
has
facilities
that
are
important
and
are
vital
or
would
be
vital
in
an
emergency
situation,
those
facilities
would
be
used,
time
to
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
guess
this
particular
one
would
--
or
at
least
going
far
at
this
time
would
come
within
the
one,
first
category.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
four?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
it
would
come
under
four,
no
(voice
overlap).
four,
is
subdivided
into
four
subcategories,
communications,
electric
power,
transportation
and
water
supply.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
possibly
there
would
be
four
that
would
be
a
justification
for
that
kind
of
determination,
certainly
one
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
there's
only
1%
of
both
utility
and
service
and
manufacturing
and
production
projects.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
--
i
think
he
would
--
these
five
categories,
i
think
there
are
clearly
ones
that
are
clearly
approved
by
congress.
and
now
i
think
he
could
defend
on
as
i
indicated
earlier,
if
he
could
show
or
make
it
show
to
the
court
that
the
placing
of
a
particular
facility
was
a
clear
views
of
discretion
and
wouldn't
come
within
any
of
the
possible
standards
for
the
secretary
of
defense
in
making
this
designation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
course
here
in
this
--
in
this
particular
instance,
since
the
statute
concerns
1962
and
1963,
of
course,
number
one,
it's
a
clear
support
for
the
designation
of
todd
shipyards
as
of
the
time
of
the
indictment
period
in
this
case.
you
know,
that
facility
was
engaged
that
time
in
a
classified
military
project
working
on
these
two
destroyers.
now,
the
district
court
relied
on
four
cases
to
make
the
determination
that
these
elements
of
activity
and
knowledge
of
unlawful
purposes
and
specific
intents
should
be
read
into
the
statute
in
order
to
hold
it
to
be
constitutional.
the
scales
case
and
noto
case
i
think
are
clearly
inapposite
since
they
--
those
were
prosecutions
which,
under
a
statute,
which
made
membership
in
an
organization
advocating
overthrow,
a
criminal
offense.
it
was
a
direct
prohibition
against
membership
in
such
organization.
and
since
it
was
a
direct
partial
abridgement
of
first
amendment
activities,
this
court
felt
it
reasonable
to
include
and
to
read
in
the
elements
of
activity
and
knowledge
of
unlawful
purposes
and
specific
intent.
here,
of
course,
it
is
not
congress'
desire
and
it
was
not
ongress'
purpose
in
passing
the
statute
to
punish
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
strictly
prophylactic
purpose,
and
it
punishes
only
the
combination
of
the
element
of
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization
while
at
the
same
time
being
an
employee
of
a
defense
facility.
and
in
that
respect,
we
think
that
it's
quite
similar
to
the
banking
act
provision
which
this
court
upheld
in
board
of
governors
v.
agnew
which
was,
of
course,
basically
a
conflict
of
interest
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it
might
be
able
constitutionally
to
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
it's
somewhat
similar
provision
with
respect
to
government
employment
is
provided
for
in
hijacks,
which
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
person.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
another
part
of
the
this
section
also
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
person
to
be
an
employee
of
the
government
while
at
the
same
time
being
a
member
of
an
organization
that
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
so.
but
i
think
he
has
the
same
opportunity
here.
this
statute
requires
that
he'd
be
put
on
notice
that
this
facility
has
been
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
and
that
notice
also
advises
him
that
the
communist
party
has
been
designated
as
a
communist-action
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
under
the
standards
of
membership
which
this
court
laid
down
in
killian.
of
course,
the
government
would
have
to
prove
--
will
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
considered
himself
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
as
of
the
time
that
he
was
also
an
employee
of
the
defense
facility.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
what
the
government,
in
a
trial
of
this
kind,
has
to
prove
that
the
man
himself
knew
that
he
was
member
of
the
communist
party
and
considered
himself
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
yes,
the
indictment
charges
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
charges
that
he
unlawfully
maintained
employment
while
at
the
same
time
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
as
far
what
the
government
has
to
show
in
the
file.
i
think
the
government
certainly
is
required
to
prove
that
the
man
knew
that
he
was
violating
the
statute.
he
had
to
know
that
this
was
a
defense
facility,
he
had
to
be
put
on
notice
in
that
effect,
he
get
to
be
put
on
notice
that
the
communist
party
had
been
designated
as
--
or
had
been
found
to
be
finally
a
communist-action
organization
and
that
he
himself
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
the
government
has
the
affirmative
burden
of
showing
every
one
of
those
elements.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
we
would
have
to
certainly
show
probably
attendance
of
meetings
or
maybe
payment
of
dues,
submitting
to
some
instructions
from
a
party,
carrying
out
instructions
from
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
think
for
example
that
we
are
obligated
as
a
district
court,
feels
that
we
would
have
to
--
in
order
to
have
the
statute
be
constitutional.
we
don't
feel
that
we're
obligated
to
show
by
evidence
of
--
thought
this
man's
own
activities
or
a
member's
own
activities
that
he
had
knowledge
through
those
activities
of
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
communist
party.
he
does
have
to,
of
course,
be
fully
aware
that
the
party
has
been
found
to
be,
after
a
board
proceeding,
a
communist-action
organization
and
therefore
as
being
an
organization
whose
objectives
may
not
be
wholly
lawful.
we
have
to
show
that.
we
don't
have
to
show
thru
his
--
i
mean,
in
other
words
we
wouldn't
have
to
have
to
show
that
they
attended
schools
where
they
talked,
where
they
discussed
marxism,
leninism,
and
so
forth.
we
don't
feel
that
we
have
to
show
that
he
had
this
specific
intent
to
bring
about
the
overthrow.
now,
in
a
particular
case,
in
the
course
proving
membership,
it
may
be
that
some
of
these
elements
would
also
be
justifiable
conclusions
from
the
activities
which
would
prove
membership.
but
our
point
is
that
that
affirmative
burden
of
proof
as
to
those
elements,
it
was
not
intended
by
congress
and
it
we
don't
think
are
appropriately
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
the
only
case.
this
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
may
of
1963
your
honor,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
subsequently
filed
and
the
district
court
held
its
decision
pending
this
court's
determination
of
the
archie
brown
case
and
the
aptheker
case.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
take
one
minute
and
possibly
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i
think,
scales
is
another
as
i
indicated,
i
don't
believe
apply
here
at
all,
aptheker
which
of
course
invalidated
the
section
6
provisions
of
the
same
act
relating
prohibition
of
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization
applying
for
using
a
passport.
i
think
an
important
difference
or
several
important
differences
between
this
situation
and
the
aptheker
situation
is,
first
of
all,
the
gravity
of
the
danger
that's
involved
here.
secondly,
in
aptheker,
the
court
is
construing
the
statute
on
its
face
held
that
only
constructive
notice
through
publication
the
federal
register
was
necessary
in
that
case.
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
individual
who
was
a
member
of
the
party
at
the
time
he
applied
for
passport
would
actually
have
knowledge
that
the
organization
had
been
designated
as
a
communist-action
organization.
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
different.
he
does
have
to
be
put
on
notice
that
the
organization
is
under
a
final
order
to
register.
the
sweep
of
the
statute
here
is
not
nearly
so
broad
as
it
was
in
aptheker.
aptheker
barred
all
travel,
by
all
members
of
the
communist
party
outside
the
western
hemisphere.
this
statute
of
course
affects
a
small
number
of
the
members
of
the
communist
party
and
it
affects
in
only
insofar
as
to
bar
him
from
working
in
1%
of
our
entire
manufacturing
plants.
the
archie
brown
of
course
which
the
district
court
also
relied
on,
i
think,
is
strictly
a
bill
of
attainder
decision
and
i
think
this
is
clearly
the
distinction.
i
like
to
save
a
few
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
in
connection
with
these
categories
under
the
delegation
of
authority.
the
five
categories
that
we
were
quoting
this
morning
were
from
the
defense
department's
release
that
was
made
at
the
time
these
listings
were
placed
into
effect.
the
similar
criteria,
frankly
identical
criteria
which
were
before
congress
are
set
forth
at
pages
443,
444
of
the
hearings
on
hr
9753
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
--
cited
in
our
brief.
there
are
very
slight
changes
of
a
few
phrases
for
example,
the
first
criteria
stated
to
congress
was
top
secret
projects,
facilities
engaged
in
top
secret
projects
and
then
it
was
explained
that
that
was
meant
to
include
top
secret,
secret
and
class
--
and
confidential
which
is
the
same
really
as
important
classified
military
projects.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
this
is
an
explanation
to
the
committee
as
part
of
the
defense
department
statement
that
a
tentative
list
had
been
prepared
which
fell
into
these
categories.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
to
the
committee,
yes.
now,
i
would
also
just
like
to
address
myself
for
a
minute
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
or
not
it
might
have
been
appropriate
or
let's
say
more
appropriate
for
congress
to
have
provided
that
a
government
agency
could
notify
an
employer
and
have
the
result
of
the
employee
being
dismissed.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
did
intend
the
statute
have
an
interim
effect.
the
purpose
of
course
was
to
get
these
people
who
insisted
on
remaining
members
of
the
communist-dominated,
foreign-dominated
group
out
of
these
places
where
in
an
emergency
situation
that
they
could
do
substantial
damage.
if
the
alternative
suggested
were
adopted,
the
person
who
is
then
a
member
of
an
organization
such
as
this
could
merely
continue
his
employment.
it
could
be
that
he
would
never
be
found
out
and
he
would
have
nothing
to
lose
by
doing
so.
this
way,
congress
really
puts
him
to
making
a
choice
of
either
remaining
in
the
organization
or
giving
up
his
defense
employment
for
the
purpose
of
getting
him
out
there
if
he
is
going
to
remain
associated
with
the
organization.
thank
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
which
is
here
for
reargument.
it
having
been
argued
but
not
decided
at
the
last
term.
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
western
district
of
washington
from
a
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
indictment
which
charged
that
the
appellee
unlawfully
from
november
1962
to
the
date
of
the
indictment
in
may
1963
was
engaged
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
designated
as
such
by
the
secretary
of
defense
while
at
the
same
time
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
of
the
designation
as
a
defense
facility
of
the
todd
shipyard
where
he
was
employed,
and
also
with
knowledge
of
the
communist
parties
having
been
finally
ordered
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
the
court
will
also
recall
that
on
appellee's
motion
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
in
order
for
the
statute
under
which
the
indictment
was
brought
to
be
held
constitutional
within
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
scales,
newdow,
brown
and
aptheker.
the
government
would
have
to
plead
and
prove
that
the
defendant
was
an
active
member
of
the
party,
that
he
had
the
specific
intent
to
bring
about
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
he
had
knowledge,
personal
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
party.
in
short,
the
district
court
held
that
the
government
would
have
to
plead
and
prove
what
amounts
to
a
smith
act
membership
case,
which
of
course
which
construction
of
the
statute
would
make
this
statute
a
complete
nullity.
the
government
of
course
in
the
lower
court
took
the
position
that
under
the
statute,
we
did
not
have
to
plead
or
prove
any
of
those
three
elements.
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
aptheker
was
one
of
the
four
cases
of
this
court
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
support
of
his
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
statute.
he
specifically
referred
to
and
relied
on
this
court's
decisions
in
scales,
newdow,
brown
and
aptheker.
so
that
aptheker
was
part
of
the
basis
for
the
district
judge's
decision.
now,
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
statute
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix
on
our
brief
on
reargument
at
page
13.
section
3(3)
of
the
statute
of
course
defines
a
communist-action
organization,
which
the
court
is
familiar
with
that
definition,
as
being
an
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
and
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
soviet
union.
the
term
facility'
is
also
defined
in
the
statute
as
being
any
plant,
factory,
or
other
manufacturing,
producing
or
service
establishment,
airport,
airport
facility,
vessel,
pier,
waterfront
facility,
mine,
railroad,
public
utility,
laboratory,
station
or
other
establishment
or
facility
or
any
part
thereof.
the
term
defense
facility'
means
any
facility
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense
pursuant
to
section
5(b).
now,
section
5
which
is
the
critical
part
of
the
statute
i
believe
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
this
morning,
today.
section
5(a)
says
that
when
a
communist
organization
is
registered
and
more
specifically
when
the
communist
organization
is
a
communist-action
organization,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
member
of
the
communist-action
organization
to
engage
in
an
employment
in
any
defense
facility.
subsection
b
of
that
same
section
authorizes
and
directs
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
facilities
as
defined
in
the
previous
--
the
earlier
section
3(7).
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
which,
he
finds
and
determines
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
the
application
of
the
provisions
of
subsection
a,
that
is
the
prohibition
against
engaging
in
employment
in
a
defense
facility
by
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization.
in
setting
this
case
for
reargument,
this
court
asked
that
we
address
ourselves
specifically
to
an
additional
question
which
was
not
raised
by
the
parties
in
their
briefs.
and
that
additional
question
is
whether
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
defense
to
designate
defense
facilities
satisfies
pertinent
constitutional
standards.
now,
since
the
first
amendment
aspects
and
due
process
aspects
of
the
case
were
fully
argued
at
the
last
term
and
in
light
of
this
additional
question
having
been
raised
by
the
court,
i
intend
to
confine
my
argument
primarily
to
that
additional
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
designation
of
authority
or
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
defense.
briefly
stated,
the
constitutional
standards
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
proper
delegation
of
authority
by
the
legislature
are
(1)
the
establishment
by
the
legislature
of
a
legislative
policy
or
a
legislative
purpose,
and
(2)
the
setting
forth
in
the
statute
of
an
intelligible
principle
to
govern
the
implementation
of
that
legislative
policy.
a
long
line
of
cases,
including
the
hirabayashi
case
and
yakus,
lichter,
panama
refining,
a
number
of
other
cases
establishes
the
principle
that
when
congress
specifies
what
job
must
be
done,
who
is
to
do
it
and
what
is
the
scope
of
his
authority,
that
is
a
permissible
delegation
by
the
legislation.
thus,
in
yakus,
this
court
sustained
the
power
of
the
administrator
to
fix
prices
of
commodities
which
in
his
judgment
would
be
fair
and
equitable
and
would
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act,
the
purposes
of
the
act
being
to
prevent
inflation
and
that
type
of
general
statement
of
purpose.
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
the
act
in
question
there
authorized
the
military
--
a
military
commander
to
prescribe
military
areas
from
which
persons
could
be
excluded
whenever
he
deems
such
action
necessary.
of
course,
in
hirabayashi,
the
court
was
sustaining
a
conviction
of
a
citizen
of
japanese
ancestry
for
violation
of
a
curfew
imposed
by
the
military
commander
in
the
pacific
coast
areas
adjacent
--
pacific
areas
adjacent
to
the
coast.
and
the
court,
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
the
--
considering
what
congress
was
doing
in
enacting
this
statute
said
that
the
court
was
--
or
that
the
congress
was
ratifying
the
executive
order
which
had
been
issued
by
the
president
and
which
conferred
authority
on
military
commanders
to
establish
these
areas,
the
security
areas,
the
purpose
being
of
course
to
safeguard
military
resources
against
sabotage.
and
this
court
in
the
hirabayashi
case
held
that
considering
the
purpose
of
congress
and
the
legislative
history
which
indicated
that
curfew
orders
were
among
the
things
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
legislation,
that
there
was
no
unconstitutional
delegation
of
authority.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
insofar
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
or
the
restriction
that
was
promulgated
by
the
military
commander,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
as
far
as
the
question
is
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
made
a
lawful
delegation
of
authority.
i
think
that
remains
the
same
whether
it's
wartime
or
peacetime.
of
course,
the
restrictions
which
were
imposed
by
the
military
commander
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
that
is
a
curfew
of
all
citizens
of
japanese
ancestry
from
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
until
six
in
the
morning
of
going
out
upon
the
street
in
a
city
of
course
was
much
more
drastic
and
obviously,
i
think
that
depended
on
the
existence
of
an
extreme
emergency
such
as
was
present
in
the
pacific
coast
in
1942.
similarly
in
the
lichter
case
which
involved
the
renegotiation
act
which
had
been
passed
by
congress
authorizing
i
think
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
navy
to
initiate
action
to
recover
excess
profits
and
in
determining
whether
or
not
congress
had
laid
down
a
sufficiently
specific
legislative
purpose.
the
court
looked
to
the
administrative
interpretations
of
excess
profits
as
enunciated
i
believe
by
some
criteria
laid
down
by
the
navy
department
and
which
were
before
the
congress
when
it
made
some
amendments
in
1942
or
1943.
and
the
court
held
that
since
congress
was
aware
of
this
administrative
implementation
of
the
statute
and
enacted
the
amendments
that
this
was
a
sufficient
statement
by
the
congress
--
expression
by
the
congress
of
the
legislative
policy
and
purpose.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
there
is
some
distinction,
your
honor.
in
a
case
such
as
that,
the
renegotiation
act
case
or
a
price
--
fixing
of
minimum
prices
and
minimal
wages,
there
is
some
distinction
in
that
there
is
an
order
after
an
administrative
hearing
directed
at
the
individual
who
is
affected
so
that
to
a
certain
extent,
i
believe
there
is
a
greater
latitude
that
has
been
shown
by
this
court
in
that
type
of
case
as
far
as
to
the
specificity
of
the
legislative
purpose.
and
i
think
that's
abundantly
clear
in
the
--
for
example,
in
the
federal
communication
statutes,
regulatory
statutes
of
that
kind
where
the
standard
is
just
and
reasonable
rates
or
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
so
forth.
this
of
course
--
this
statute,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
main
brief
and
submitted
to
the
court
last
term
is
an
exercise
of
the
war
power
and
it
would
--
i
would
think
that
as
for
example
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
where
the
court
has
held
that
a
broad
discretion
must
be
allowed
to
the
president,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
a
case
since
it
does
involve
the
war
power
that
a
broad
discretion
should
be
allowed
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
however,
i
think
there's
no
need
in
this
particular
case
for
the
court
to
have
to
consider
the
grant
of
a
broad
discretion
without
identifiable
guidelines
because
i
think
that
this
statute
in
its
--
on
the
face
of
it
and
certainly
in
light
of
its
legislative
history
makes
it
abundantly
clear
exactly
what
it
was.
that
was
the
authority
conferred
on
the
secretary
of
defense.
i
think
it's
well
within
the
limitations
that
this
court
has
required
for
delegation
of
this
kind.
congress
here
in
section
5(a)
has
said
that
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization,
it's
unlawful
for
a
member
of
the
communist-action
organization
to
be
employed
in
a
defense
facility.
the
only
thing
that
has
been
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
defense
is
a
determination
by
him
based
on
the
facts
available
to
him
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
facility
is
a
defense
facility.
the
--
now,
the
criteria
that
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
which
he
must
use,
must
follow
is
the
security
of
the
united
states
requires
that
a
particular
facility
be
designated
as
a
defense
facility.
now,
the
appellee
contends
that
this
is
a
--
is
an
unduly
vague
criterion,
the
security
of
the
united
states.
they
say
it's
not
susceptible
of
a
definition
which
would
confine
in
any
way
the
secretary
of
defense.
a
somewhat
similar
problem
of
defining
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
determining
the
connotation
of
that
phrase
was
faced
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
involving
scarbeck,
irvin
scarbeck,
a
former
employee
of
the
state
department
who
had
turned
over
classified
information
to
an
agent
of
the
polish
government.
he
was
--
he
was
charged
and
convicted
with
violating
section
4
of
the
same
act,
the
internal
security
act.
section
4
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
an
officer
or
an
employee
of
the
united
states
to
furnish
to
a
representative
of
a
foreign
government
information
that
has
been
classified
as
affecting
the
security
of
the
united
states.
the
information
which
he
turned
over
had
been
classified
as
defense
information
under
executive
order
10501
of
the
president.
he
said
they're
totally
different.
information
classified
as
defense
information
doesn't
bring
it
within
the
purview
of
this
statute
which
prohibits
turning
over
information
affecting
the
security
of
the
united
states.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
scarbeck
properly
held,
we
think,
as
follows.
they
say
appellant
has
not
undertaken
to
show
that
defense
information
as
described
in
the
executive
order
is
not
a
necessity
information
affecting
the
security
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
section
7(a)(3)(b)
which
is
section
4
of
this
statute.
common
sense
tells
us
that
it
is.
defense
is
one
aspect
of
security
and
indeed,
in
their
broad
senses,
the
two
terms
have
a
very
similar
connotation.
the
legislative
history
as
we
have
seen
shows
that
congress
must
have
equated
the
two
terms
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
statute
and
the
intent
of
congress
in
utilizing
this
language
as
equating
national
defense
with
security.
now,
i
think
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
that
is
exactly
what
congress
was
doing.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
still
is
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
prophylactic.
it's
to
remove
from
a
sensitive
position
a
person
who
is
currently
and
continuously
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
obviously,
i
think
it
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
communist
party
or
the
international
communist
movement
to
continuously
have
incidents
of
sabotage
other
than
when
they
might
deem
them
to
be
valuable.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
a
considerable
period
of
time,
at
least
10.
mr.
abt
may
be
able
to
--
within
my
understanding
is
he's
been
a
long
time
employee
of
the
shipyard.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
the
only
statute
by
which
the
government
can
exercise
any
control
over
his
employment
at
todd
shipyard.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
he's
not
employee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
your
honor,
in
the
cafeteria
workers
case,
that
was
a
government
installation.
it
was
a
navy
yard.
here,
todd
shipyards
is
a
private
shipyard.
the
government
does
not
operate
it.
the
government
has
no
supervision
over
it
at
all
other
than
in
the
performance
of
specific
government
contracts,
for
example,
the
building
of
ships
and
other
than
as
to
the
possible
applicability
now
of
this
statute.
but
other
than
that
--
in
other
words,
there's
no
security
program
as
such
for
this
type
of
facility
except
insofar
as
an
employee
of
the
facility
might
be
working
on
a
classified
government
contract.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
sensitive,
your
honor.
but
the
only
authority
that
the
government
--
that
the
executive
has
to
take
any
action
is
authority
which
would
be
conferred
on
it
by
congress
or
which
it
would
get
by
virtue
of
a
contract
with
the
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
contracts
which
are
issued
by
the
defense
department
under
the
industrial
security
program
do
provide
for
screening
clearances
to
be
approved
by
the
military
departments
in
connection
with
employees
who
are
to
be
given
access
to
classified
information.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
i
think
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this,
your
honor,
there
is
at
present
time
employee
security
programs
for
the
government
as
the
court
is
well
aware
for
the
industrial
personnel
security
program
which
involves
access
to
classified
information.
congress
in
passing
this
statute
said
there's
a
loophole.
we
need
some
kind
of
a
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
from
pages
12
to
29
of
our
brief
last
term,
the
testimony
before
the
committees
which
were
considering
these
bills
and
had
been
for
a
number
of
years
prior,
representatives
of
the
department
of
defense,
the
president
in
his
veto
message
indicated
there
was
a
desirability
to
cover
this
particular
area.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
couldn't
have
taken
the
position
that
the
existing
security
programs
covered
this
situation
because
they
just
don't
as
a
factual
matter.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
was
a
bill
before
the
committee
before
this
section
was
finally
decided
on
which
would
have
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
an
employee
of
a
defense
contractor
to
become
a
member
of
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
no,
i
think
it's
specifically
mentioned
in
the
communist
party.
the
department
of
justice
objected
to
the
enactment
of
that
bill
on
the
basis
first
that
it
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder
as
specifically
naming
the
communist
party.
and
congress
--
oh,
and
also,
there
were
no
legislative
findings.
now,
in
enacting
this
section,
congress
of
course
removed
the
mention
of
the
communist
party,
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
definition
to
include
members
of
communist-action
organizations
and
also
made
extensive
legislative
findings
as
to
the
necessity
for
this
legislation,
and
of
its
concern
that
defense
facilities
be
protected,
must
be
protected
from
the
dangers
of
sabotage.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
is
there
anywhere
a
designation?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
and
i
think
that
the
only
place
where
there
could
be
any
review
at
all
of
the
administrator's
designation
of
a
particular
facility
would
be
in
connection
with
a
criminal
case
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
with
respect
to
his
discretion
from
a
factual
standpoint
as
to
whether
this
is
or
isn't
a
vital
defense
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
would
only
have
a
defense
if
the
court
would
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
particular
facility
involved
could
not
be
a
defense
facility.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
the
statute
of
course
conveys
on
the
secretary
the
discretion
as
i
think
it
properly
should.
i
mean
obviously,
there
are
factors
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
that
he
has
knowledge,
that
it
has
been
so
designated
by
the
secretary
and
that
he
has
knowledge
that
the
communist
party
is
under
a
final
order
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
they
may
not
be
hard.
i
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
is
the
end
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
unless
the
court
could
determine
that
it
had
no
relationship,
that
the
designation
had
no
relationship
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
the
designation
of
a
shipyard
by
the
secretary
of
defense
pursuant
to
the
statute
is
the
kind
of
binding
determination
that
the
congress
has
given
to
the
secretary.
it's
a
similar
authority
which
was
given
to
the
military
commanders
in
the
hirabayashi
case
to
take
whatever
action
was
necessary
to
protect
military
resources
and
the
argument
or
there
was
a
discussion
by
the
court
that
what
he
did
was
rationally
connected
with
protection
against
sabotage.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
his
concern
?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
it
had
a
relation
to
the
national
defense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
they
all
have
to
be
limit
by
the
phrase,
the
secretary
determines
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
require
protection
against
sabotage.
now,
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
and
i
think
that
that's
completely
consistent
with
the
hirabayashi
case.
and
the
court
in
the
hirabayashi
didn't
say,
well,
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
is
not
reasonable.
maybe
it
should
have
been
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
that
the
curfew
should
have
started.
what
the
court
did
decide
was
that
the
regulation
that
the
military
commander
did
impose
at
a
rational
connection
with
the
purposes
that
congress
have
in
legislating
protection
against
sabotage,
protection
of
war
resources.
since
the
court
made
that
determination
when
the
basis
of
the
facts
known
to
it,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
question
of
challenging
the
judgment
of
the
military
commander
or
as
to
whether
or
not
another
judgment
would
have
placed
a
different
time
limit
or
different
areas
to
be
involved
in
the
so-called
military
areas
and
as
i
started
to
mention
a
few
minutes
ago
in
connection
with
that
very
problem
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
pointed
out
that
where
the
orders
under
the
present
act
have
some
relation
to
a
protection
against
espionage
and
against
sabotage,
our
test
is
at
an
end.
that
is
that
the
court
should
not
undertake
to
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
to
--
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
regulation
of
the
military
command.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
confined
to
organizations
dominated
by
the
soviet
union
as
a
matter
of
legislative
construction
as
enunciated
by
this
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
literally
says,
the
foreign
government
which
is
the
leader
of
international
communist
movement
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
this
court
held
that
to
be
the
soviet
union
as
a
matter
of
legislative
construction.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
if
an
organization
were
dominated
by
the
communist
chinese
government
and
not
by
the
soviet
government
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir.
i
just
don't
think
that
the
situation
that
exists
today
had
crystallized
at
the
time
of
the
legislative
findings
in
1950.
on
the
other
hand,
i
certainly
disagree
with
the
contention
which
the
appellee
tries
to
make
out
of
that
change
in
situation
that
this
completely
nullify
the
fact
that
we
now
have
a
communist
chinese
and
possibly
their
own
small
orbit
communist
nations
that
completely
nullifies
all
the
findings
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
that
there
no
longer
is
an
international
communist
movement
led
by
the
soviet
union
and
i
just
think
that
factually,
that's
completely
erroneous.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
i
understand
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
i
would
not
cover
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
not
cover
the
hypothetical
situation
that
your
honor
raises.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
free
from
governmental
interference
anyway.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
unreasonable
government
interference.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
the
issue,
your
honor,
but
to
say
it's
unreviewable,
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it's
not
reviewable
as
to
whether
or
not
his
discretion
should
be
substituted
for.
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
except
on
the
grounds
that
the
designation
might
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
think
that's
the
only
ground
that
it
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
to
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
capricious.
i
think
that
could
be
reviewed,
yes.
but
i
think
that
once
it
appears
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
is
in
the
statute
but
i
think
it's
a
similar
standard
for
review
which
the
court
was
using
in
hirabayashi
but
once
it
appears
from
the
circumstances
that
it
has
--
that
the
designation
has
a
relationship
to
national
defense
that
it
has
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
he
could
make
the
contention
and
the
court
could
undertake
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
this
was
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
designation.
now,
i
certainly
think
that
once
it
appears
to
the
--
once
the
court
is
apprised
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
shipyard
that
it
has
some
relationship
on
the
face
of
things
to
national
defense
and
i
think
the
court
is
not
entitled
to
undertake
an
investigation
as
to
whether
or
not
this
secretary's
judgment
should
be
substituted
for.
in
that
respect,
i
think
it's
no
different
than
many
statutes.
for
example,
under
the
price
--
the
regulation
of
commodity
prices,
suppose
that
the
administrator
decided
that
a
loaf
of
bread
should
cost
$0.26
and
no
more.
well,
certainly,
the
court
is
not
entitled
to
undertake
a
de
novo
review
of
whether
or
not
that's
a
good
judgment
by
the
administrator
and
decide
that
it
should
have
been
$0.28
or
$0.27
or
$0.23
because
this
was
a
discretion
that
was
conferred
on
him
by
the
congress.
and
as
long
as
--
what
he
does
is
in
effectuation
of
the
congressional
policy
in
purpose
in
enacting
the
statute,
he
has
an
authority
to
do
it.
now,
moreover,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that's
involved
in
this
case
and
especially
in
connection
with
the
1962
amendments,
your
honors
will
recall
that
the
statute
in
1950
and
originally,
it
required
the
secretary
of
defense
to
prepare
a
list
of
defense
facilities
and
such
list
was
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register.
when
the
order
against
the
communist
party
became
final
in
1961,
the
secretary
was
confronted
for
the
first
time
with
the
necessity
of
implementing
the
statute.
he
did
prepare
a
list
of
defense
facilities
and
it
was
perfectly
apparent
in
1961
as
it
had
been
to
president
truman
in
1950
on
the
point
--
one
of
the
points
in
which
he
vetoed
the
bill
that
the
publication
of
federal
register
of
a
list
of
those
defense
facilities
would
be
providing
a
guidebook
for
sabotage.
it
would
be
providing
a
list
of
military
targets,
and
for
that
reason,
the
defense
department
went
back
to
congress
and
ask
for
an
amendment
to
the
statute
eliminating
the
necessity
of
publication
in
the
federal
register.
at
that
time
in
1962,
when
congress
had
these
amendments
under
consideration,
the
secretary
of
defense
advised
the
congress
of
five
specific
criteria
which
he
was
using
in
implementing
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
but
insofar
as
a
designation
would
come
within
these
five,
it
would
certainly
be
within
the
authority
conferred
on
him.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
limitation
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
a
facility
that
the
interest
of
national
defense
requires
protection
against
sabotage.
i
think,
that's
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
know
where
designation
like
this
could
be
reviewed
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
or
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
the
list
that
was
originally
provided
for
when
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress,
that
the
publication
of
this
list
would
be
bad
from
a
national
defense
standpoint,
i
think
highlights
the
fact
that
there
should
not
be
review.
that
congress
did
do
not
intend
to
review
of
the
underlying
rationale.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
there
could
be,
your
honor.
it
could
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
there
is
your
honor
anyway
for
him
to
challenge
the
merits
unless
it
should
appear
to
the
court
and
then
say,
i
have
to
quote
that
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
you
always
do.
but
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
conferred
on
the
secretary,
i
don't
think
it
is
reviewable.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
hirabayashi.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
hirabayashi
is
on
all
force
with
this.
and
hirabayashi
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
delegation
and
also
on
reviewability.
i
think
it's
the
same
thing
with
hirabayashi.
there
was
no
reviewability
there
as
to
whether
the
military
commander's
determination
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
as
long
as
there
is
rational
connection
then
i
think
the
court's
duty
has
come
to
an
end.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
certainly,
the
right
to
go
out
in
the
street
in
the
evening
after
eight
o'clock
at
night
and
before
six
in
the
morning.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
so.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
mean
i
--
for
example,
i
think
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
down
the
street.
now,
it
can
be
reasonably
infringed.
if
there
is
a
fire,
they
can
detour
us
around
the
block
but
absent
some
lawful
and
proper
governmental
interest,
we
do
have
a
right
to
walk
down
the
street
to
come
out
of
our
houses,
to
go
abroad
and
the
city.
in
hirabayashi,
because
of
the
agencies
of
the
war
situation,
because
of
the
judgment
made
by
the
military
commander
as
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation,
he
imposed
a
curfew
on
citizens
of
japanese
ancestor
and
citizens
i
think
of
possibly
germany
ancestry,
i
don't
know.
but
japanese
ancestry
was
involved.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
but
that's
only
because
it's
a
more
stringent
thing
that
was
done.
i
think
what
was
done
in
hirabayashi
is
much
more
stringent
than
what
is
being
done
here.
in
the
first
place,
a
person
of
japanese
ancestry
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
once
1941
or
42
came.
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization
who
wants
to
continue
employment
in
a
defense
facility,
he
can
do
something
about
it.
he
can
get
out
of
the
organization
at
least
or
he
can
find
another
job
but
so
that
what
was
resorted
to
in
hirabayashi
is
much
more
detrimental,
it
seems
to
me,
than
what
is
resorted
to
by
congress
here.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
that's
being
accomplished
here
is
no
different
and
if
congress
--
pardon
me,
have
set
up
a
screening
program
for
all
persons
who
are
employed
in
defense
facilities.
the
same
is
done
by
the
military
under
the
industrial
personnel
security
program.
and
certainly,
if
a
member
of
the
communist
party
having
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
been
found
to
be
and
is
under
a
final
order
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization
and
has
been
found
to
be
after
extensive
administrative
proceedings,
an
organization
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
and
operated
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
the
soviet
union
and
he
applied
for
a
clearance
under
a
screening
program
with
the
intention
of
continuing
in
the
party,
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
deny
him
a
clearance
on
that
basis
not
because
his
loyalty
or
his
lack
of
loyalty
has
been
demonstrated
but
because
it's
in
doubt.
and
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
where
a
national
defense
is
the
ultimate
objective.
it
does
not
require
us
to
take
a
chance
on
persons
who
knowingly
continue
as
members
in
a
foreign
dominated
organization.
thank
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
want
to
take
a
minute
in
connection
with
justice
brennan's
questions
concerning
the
scope
of
possible
review
at
the
criminal
trial.
in
our
--
in
a
footnote
on
page
2
of
our
brief
on
reargument,
we
point
out
or
make
the
contention
that
to
the
extent
that
the
appellee
is
entitled
to
show
that
the
findings
of
the
secretary
are
so
bereft
of
factual
support
that
they
provide
no
rational
basis
for
the
enforcement
of
the
act
citing
carolene
products
case.
the
question
presented
would
be
one
for
the
judge
to
decide
on
motion
rather
than
an
issue
for
the
jury
citing
fox
v.
united
states.
and
we
submit
that
that
would
be
the
standard
of
review
which
would
be
available
to
the
defendant
as
a
legal
contention.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
there
is.
the
legislative
history
would
indicate,
at
least
as
far
as
the
committee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it's
always
reviewable
for
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
determination,
your
honor.
i
hope
i'm
not
giving
away
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
that
--
i
figured
--
i
simply
read
to
provide
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
doubt
it.
i
would
not
think
that
congress
for
example
could
confer
authority
on
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch
which
would
include
the
making
of
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
determination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
right.
and
just
the
one
other
point
then
in
connection
with
the
point
raised
by
justice
fortas
concerning
the
possibility
as
i
understand
it
of
including
in
a
provision,
a
contractual
provision
which
the
government
might
have
with
a
facility
of
this
type
as
for
a
screening
of
other
employees
who
would
not
be
given
access
or
were
not
applying
for
access
to
classified
information.
i
might
just
point
out
in
connection
with
that
that
of
course
all
of
the
facilities
which
are
designated
by
the
secretary
and
which
the
statute
contemplates
should
be
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense
are
not
facilities
which
have
contracts
with
the
government.
for
example,
power
stations
may
be
supplying
power
to
an
aircraft
corporation
which
is
performing
a
government
contract.
because
of
the
--
