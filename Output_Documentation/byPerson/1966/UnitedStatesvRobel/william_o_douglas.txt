now

you

your

don't

it

for

what

once

once
we

there's
no
single
boss
of

the

yes,
but
not.
but
if
you
say
that
then
you're
a
legislating.
you're
no
longer
applying
your
statute
as
this
statute
is
based
on
the
existence
of
only
one.
and
i
submit
in
conclusion
that
declaration
that
this
statute
as
drawn
now.
it's
based
on
a
fictitious
premise
in
the
light
of
what's,
we
all
know
that
that
is
overdue
and
moreover,
that
would
have
the
wholesome
effect
of
relegating
not
only
section
5
but
this
entire
act
to
where
it
belongs
in
a
museum
of
antiquities
along
with
the
alien
sedition
laws,
the
dred
scott
case,
the
(inaudible)
as
reminders
of

transgressions
of
civil
liberties
in
this

at
times
of

and
as
a

against
the

of
such
horrors
in
