justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
does
that
differ?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
that
suppo
--
suppose
i
don't
know
what
this
ordinance,
if
i
administer
that,
i
gather
nothing,
that's
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
said.
but
suppose
that
had
a
provision
comparable
to
that
in
the
san
francisco
that
there's
an
annual
inspection
according
to
some
routine
plan
of
inspecting
all
of
the
buildings
of
--
kinds
of
buildings
in
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
dorsen
that
essentially
what
you're
saying
is
that
something
less
than
a
showing
in
a
criminal
case
would
suffice
a
part
of
that
it's
absolutely
essential
if
--
if
the
proper
entry
demand
of
that
there
be
the
intervention
of
a
judge
before
someone
enters.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
fact
here
is,
as
long
as
the
plan
is
as
you
call
it
that
was
a
--
your
real
answer
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
judicial
intervention
that
that's
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
it
was
abel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
you
do
if
the
court's
decision
in
abel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
on
this
point
of
judicial
intervention
the
court's
there
as
i
recall
it
find
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
--
there
of
course
because
there
was
the
need
in
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
know
that
mr.
newbould?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
implication
of
reasonableness
where
there
is
constitutional
requirement
or
just
as
the
matter
of
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
you
mean
that
they
implied
this
in,
in
the
interpretation
or
the
ordinance
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it's
not
a
search.
it's
something
called
an
inspection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
become
difficult
if
you
say
this
is
not
a
search
but
an
inspection.
and
that's
something
called
an
inspection
not
being
a
search
as
outside
the
--
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
private
home
or
a
public
building.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
exactly
the
same
concept
i'm
suggesting
that
the
search
warrant
would
grant
him
to
do
that.
