suppose
they
had
the
books
that
they
were
--
in
the
part
of
the
building
that's
open
to
the
public,
do
they
have
the
right
to
seize
those
books
without
a
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
say,
summarizing
the
position
we
urged
upon
this
court
that
there
must
be
some
judicial
barrier
to
the
exercise
of
unchecked
discretions
by
administrative
official,
this
is
on
page
3,
who
are
seeking
to
gain
admission
to
private
premises.
there
must
be
some
rational
means
of
assuring
a
private
citizen
that
his
property
is
being
opened
as
part
of
a
rational
inquiry
of
authorized
representatives
of
local
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
dorsen,
suppose
the
inspector
had
known
the
magistrate,
sworn
that
there
was
a
local
ordinance
or
statute
which
permitted
him
to
make
periodic
inspections
in
the
interest
of
safety,
would
you
think
that
would
be
sufficient
ground
to
issue
a
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he'd
have
to
say
anything
about
it's
being
a
wooden
frame
house?
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
way
of
what
i'm
asking
is
that,
do
you
think
that
in
order
to
get
a
search
warrant,
it
is
sufficient
to
rely
upon
the
judgment
of
the
legislative
body
that
periodic
to
the
inspection
one
each
year
or
two
each
year
are
necessary,
and
that
in
order
to
comply
with
that
part,
that
that's
our
law,
the
inspector
must
now
be
allowed
to
inspect
in
this
house.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
in
your
judgment
authorize
a
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i'm
assuming
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
why
would
an
ordinance
which
permitted
the
search
--
search
without
a
warrant
but
on
the
probable
cause
that
--
creation
of
the
periodic
right
to
search,
to
inspect
why
would
an
ordinance
be
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
did
the
same
thing
that
would
be
done
in
case
of
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
just
limited
to
the
city.
you've
got
a
right
to
make
the
search
in
order
to
discover
fire
hazards
under
an
ordinance
and
you'll
search,
and
you'll
enter
into
the
house.
and
that
that's
what
he
wants
to
get
in
there
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
well
if
that's
the
case.
why
is
an
ordinance
invalid
which
provides
for
certainty
in
inspection
upon
the
basis
that
periodical
searches
are
necessary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
he
be
if
all
he
has
to
swear
is
precisely
the
facts
upon
which
the
legislation
obeys?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
dorsen,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
suppose
one
should
believe
that
the
regular
routine
annual
practice
of
inspecting
a
fire
hazard
is
within
the
power
of
the
state,
that's
enough
to
justify
an
entry
into
the
house.
how
could
he
then
say
that
the
ordinance
was
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean
is
if
--
if
the
legislature
has
authorized
inspection
will
be
done
under
a
system
which
does
not
violate
the
first
--
the
fourth
amendment,
how
could
we
hold
that
that
ordinance
is
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
how
would
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
required
suppose
the
occupant
wanted
him
to
have
to
have
a
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
he
could
swear
no
more
that
the
--
the
best
probable
cause
and
the
ordinance
itself
provided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
