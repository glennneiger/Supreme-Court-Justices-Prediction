mr.
a.
l.
newbould
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
stated
by
the
appellant,
the
ordinance
before
the
court
today
is
the
seattle
fire
code.
generally
speaking
this
ordinance
regulates
the
handling
of
combustible
materials
and
liquids.
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
certain
buildings,
the
equipment
that
must
be
put
into
plants
and
warehouses
and
apartment
houses,
and
what
we
refer
to
as
highlight
for
occupancies,
all
in
connection
with
fire
prevention
activities.
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
is
directed
towards
flammable
and
explosive
materials
and
liquids.
the
method
of
obtaining
compliance
with
this
ordinance
is
one
that's
been
in
existence
in
the
cities
since
about
1884
in
one
form
or
another.
today,
it
involves
a
fire
inspection
program.
virtually
every
member
of
the
seattle
fire
department,
it
is
involved
in
this
inspection
program
and
it
goes
on
during
the
non-winter
months
of
the
year.
the
object
of
the
ordinance
is
remedial
and
not
punitive.
we
are
not
attempting
here
to
--
or
our
object
here
is
not
to
put
people
in
jail
or
to
put
fines
on
our
citizens
but
to
attempt
to
cure
a
defect,
or
error
of
omission
if
you
please
before
the
fire
actually
occurs.
the
ultimate
goal
then
is
one
of
cooperative
compliance
not
penalty.
when
we
look
at
mr.
see's
warehouse,
the
fire
department
didn't
come
to
his
warehouse
and
ask
for
an
inspection.
demand
is
one
way
to
put
it,
request
is
another
way.
there
was
no
immediate
entry
into
the
warehouse,
it's
been
some
three
years
now
and
the
fire
department
is
still
not
in
the
warehouse.
what
are
we
talking
about
in
sense
of
--
of
the
interest
of
these
men
in
this
warehouse.
a
warehouse
is
a
possessory
of
right
of
property
interest.
we're
not
talking
about
intimate
personal
relationships;
we're
talking
solely
about
property
rights.
we
don't
have
the
problem
here
of
the
young
lady
at
the
door
who
is
afraid
of
who
is
going
to
come
in.
we
look
at
the
fourth
amendment,
we
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
seattle
ordinance
has
interfered
with
mr.
see's
security
and
his
person,
his
house,
his
paper,
or
his
personal
effect.
we
find
out
that
if
there
is
an
interference
it's
one
with
a
“property
right”
such
as
it
maybe.
now,
historically
in
this
country,
inspections
have
been
accepted
as
non-fourth
amendment
process.
principally,
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
directed
at
criminal
prosecutions
and
the
accumulation
of
evidence
for
those
prosecutions.
while
in
some
of
the
cases,
particularly
frank,
abuses
this
type
of
inspection
process
are
being
predicted.
the
facts
are
that
these
abuses
have
not
arisen.
mr.
see
here
does
not
claim
that
the
fire
department
was
harassing
him,
that
they
broke
down
his
door,
that
he
came
at
a
non-reasonable
time,
that
they
were
other
than
harassing
then
repeated
that
they
were
picking
on
him
for
some
particular
violations.
in
fact,
they
did
not
know
whether
or
not
mr.
see
had
violated
the
ordinance.
we're
getting
here
to
the
point
that
the
fire
inspector,
at
the
time
these
firemen
did
not
know
whether
or
not
mr.
see
had
a
fire
hazard
within
his
building.
he
does
not
know
the
contents.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we
take
the
attitude
that
the
--
and
the
supreme
court
analyzed
it
this
way.
while
the
word
reasonableness
is
not
in
the
ordinance,
this
is
an
implied
requirement
by
law
that
the
ordinance,
the
inspection
provisions
of
the
ordinance
be
administered
reasonably.
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
right
to
force
entry
into
mr.
see's
warehouse.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
pardon
me.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
other
words
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
the
interpretation
of
the
ordinance.
if
there
were
a
particular
conviction
there
would
be
a
requirement
that
the
inspection
have
been
a
reasonable
inspection.
that
you
can't
imply
into
the
ordinance
that
it
authorizes
unreasonable
inspections.
this
is
our
alternative
and
my
point
is
that
any
enforcement
and
the
practical
enforcement
of
this
ordinance
there
will
be
a
requirement
that
each
area
of
the
inspection
process
be
reasonable
and
to
the
extent
that
it
becomes
then
unreasonable,
it
becomes
outside
the
legislative
authority.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
there
is
a
difference
in
the
analysis
of
the
issue.
the
point
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
let
me
state
my
point
so
it's
clearer.
i'm
stating
that
the
inspection
progress
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
yes
sir.
the
inspection
process
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
the
final
analysis,
no.
the
inspection
process
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
prohibited
procedure.
because
it
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it
is
not
a
procedure
prohibited
or
proscribe
by
the
fourth
amendment.
so
long
as
we're
dealing
with
safety
inspections
of
buildings
and
we
do
not
touch
the
person,
we
do
not
interfere
with
the
intimate
relationships
of
his
home,
we
do
not
interfere
with
his
papers
or
his
effects.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it's
an
inspection.
it's
not
a
search
and
seizure.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
there's
no
difference
in
the
analysis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
this
case
becomes
easier
to
--
to
decide
because
we
may
not
get
into
the
areas
of
rights
of
privacy
and
the
--
and
the
intimate
relationships
of
alike.
this
makes
a
lot
a
difference
but
the
--
my
provision
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
how
we
say
we
do
it,
yes
your
honor.
but
it's
because
we're
interfering
with
these
items
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
these
one
is
easier
because
it's
more
clear
that
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
person,
his
house,
his
person,
his
papers
or
his
effects.
when
you
get
to
the
home
situation
--
that
situation,
if
the
analysis
becomes
more
difficult
of
what
--
if
we
look
back
into
history,
we
find
out
that
these
inspections
have
been
accepted.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct.
unless
we
--
unless
we
have
troubles
with
our
analysis
of
the
right
to
privacy.
and
i
suggest
the
court
has
had
troubles
in
this
area.
it's
not
that
clear
a
proposition.
until
we
--
unless
we
stick
with
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment,
person,
house,
papers
and
effects,
we
have
an
extremely
dif
--
difficult
issue.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
i
wouldn't
agree
to
that
proposition
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
any
time
you
move
into
the
criminal
process.
in
other
words,
we're
talking
about
the
penal
process,
we're
moving
against
the
person.
we
make
the
difference
or
we
make
the
statement
in
our
brief
that
there's
a
major
difference
between
something
in
random.
we
look
at
the
--
the
structure
of
a
building.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
activities
that
are
carried
on
inside
the
warehouse.
now,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
activities
inside
the
house.
we
are
concerned
with
the
construction
of
the
walls.
we're
concerned
with
its
plumbing,
but
were
not
concerned
with
his
person,
his
papers
or
his
personal
effects.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we're
concerned
with
the
chemical
content
of
that
personal
effect.
that's
true.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
content
of
those
personal
effects.
we
will
tell
him
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
storage
of
that
chemical
material
close
to
that
fire
presents
a
fire
hazard.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
for
seizing
or
searching
those
papers,
we
don't
touch
it.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
and
he
says
we
should
leave
him
alone
and
i
agree
that
the
government
should
leave
him
alone.
i
do
not
agree
that
he
has
a
right
to
keep
those
papers
that
close
to
the
fire
if
in
fact
we
agree
that
a
hazard
which
enda
--
endangers
the
entire
neighborhood.
this
is
the
point.
it's
not
what's
in
the
papers
and
it's
not
what
is
in
his
books.
it's
not
whether
the
alcohol
that
he
has
in
a
particular
can
is
seasoned
or
otherwise,
it's
the
chemical
nature
of
it
that
creates
a
fire
hazard
or
the
explosion
hazard.
and
this
is
what
we
are
concerned
with.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
no
sir.
he
would
get
a
notice
to
correct
the
deficiency.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
--
the
explosives
requires
a
special
permit
to
store.
if
he
told
the
inspectors
that
those
are
cases
of
m1
ammunitions,
he
would
get
an
instruction
immediately
to
take
out
the
permit
and
when
he
got
his
permit
he
must
store
them
in
accordance
with
the
permit.
now,
i
--
i
spoke
of
the
compliance
with
the
fire
inspection
ordinances
or
the
fire
prevention
ordinances
as
being
primarily
a
voluntary
type
of
encouragement
to
get
people
to
cooperate
in
eliminating
fires
and
explosions.
normally,
i
would
say
that
he
would
take
out
his
permit
and
construct
the
necessary
walls
to
protect
this.
if
he
did
not,
then
we
come
to
the
ultimate
of
the
process
and
then
we
would
be
forced
to
take
him
into
court
and
say
that
you're
storing
ammunition
without
a
permit.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct.
i
--
that's
what
i
state.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
page
19
of
the
record
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
this
case.
it
should
be
noted
that
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
seizure
of
evidence
for
use
of
--
in
court
and
there
is
no
threat
of
criminal
penalty
even
if
the
fire
hazards
were
detected.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
you
said
would
we
arrest
him
and
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
supreme
court
instruction
to
this
says
that
--
we
must
give
the
notice
first,
and
if
the
violation
of
the
notice
that
constitutes
then
the
crime.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
our
building
code
says
that,
yes
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
as
a
furtherance
of
the
fire
code.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
one
of
the
fire
inspections?
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we
don't
have
inspections
such
as
this
in
connection
with
our
building
code.
there
are
different
types
of
inspections.
now,
the
case
here
today
is
a
fire
inspection.
now,
the
building
inspection,
we
may
have
an
entirely
different
case
under
our
building
code
and
that
inspection
ordinance.
we
may
have
an
entirely
different
case
than
we
have
today.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
when
a
fireman
goes
into
the
--
the
commercial
premises
under
this
ordinance.
we're
talking
about
under
the
fire
code
and
under
this
inspection
authorization.
the
only
thing
he
may
do
when
he
gets
through
is
to
give
a
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
then
he
will
be
prosecuted
if
there's
not
a
correction
within
the
reasonable
time.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
difference
between
the
first
time
and
the
second
time,
the
second
time
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
second
entry
will
be
--
it
may
be
denied.
but
then
we
have
the
notice
and
we
have
the
violation
theoretically
and
the
non
--
the
non-conformance.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
no
sir.
not
if
he
refuses.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
he
could
--
not
under
washington
law,
he
could
not
get
a
warrant.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
what's
--
if
--
if
we
assume
we
waive
the
--
the
question
of
the
consent
of
the
entry
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
now,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
had
this
argument
before
them
too.
they
are
on
page
26
of
the
record.
the
supreme
court
said,
“the
related
issues
and
knowledge
gained
by
the
inspection
for
possible
use
in
any
subsequent
criminal
cases.”
that
is
the
question
we
do
not
pass
upon
at
this
time
since
it
is
not
before
us.
now,
whereas
that
the
defendant
here
or
the
appellant
has
not
been
prosecuted
for
violation
of
the
ordinance.
we
are
not
in
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
--
pinpoint
an
answer.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
one
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
one
state
court
did
have
to
face
up
to
the
problem
and
the
case
is
now
on
the
calendar.
and
they
found
a
particular
solution
not
that
i
necessarily
agree
with
it
but
the
solution
was
found
to
solve
this
particular
problem.
once
they
had
permitted
the
entry,
what
happens
in
the
subsequent
crimi
--criminal
prosecution
to
the
evidence
of
this
variety?
the
point
i
would
make
when
we
do
get
there
is
in
that
entry
it
was
there
any
insecurity,
or
was
there
an
interference
with
the
security
if
this
person,
his
paper
or
his
personal
effects?
as
to
mr.
see,
i
will
say
no.
but
as
i
say
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
get
to
this
particular
question.
i
would
like
to
take
a
minute
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that
--
i
beg
it
is
different
with
you
there
sir.
that's
not
correct.
it's
dicta
in
the
case.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it's
dicta
in
the
case.
this
was
read
out
of
the
see
case,
the
statement
that
a
warrant
is
required.
when
we
get
to
that
point
in
the
state
court,
we
will
be
faced
with
the
statutory
process
for
the
issuance
of
warrants
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
this
is
an
extremely
limited
process
and
i
would
like
to
spell
it
out
to
the
court,
if
i
might,
right
here
to
show
you
what
--
what
we're
concerned
with.
you
can
get
a
warrant
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
counsel
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
they
have
but
not
in
the
case
before
that.
because
we
were
not
into
a
residential
house
and
we've
not
try
to
get
into
a
residential
premises
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
--
at
that
time.
that
question
of
how
to
get
in
to
a
residence
was
not
argued.
and
when
the
courts
decide
questions
like
this,
we
get
into
trouble
and
it
takes
us
more
time
to
search
(voice
overlap).
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
there's
no
law
on
it
at
all,
on
how
you
get
into
--
how
you
show
probable
cause
and
to
whom
in
order
to
gain
entry
to
a
house
for
a
fire
inspection.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
my
position
is
res
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
he
could
have,
but
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
but
for
the
ordinance
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it
says
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
but
for
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
well,
we
have
no
cases
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we
have
never
been
into
the
problem.
we
don't
go
into
residences.
we
don't
go
into
residences
under
the
fire
code
even
in
apartment
buildings.
the
question
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
been
raised
in
connection
with
an
urban
renewal
housing
inspection
program,
so
that
the
legal
issue
to
be
passed
on
by
the
court
just
has
never
been
there.
as
i
say
this
is
dicta
in
the
case
because
we
were
not
here
dealing
with
a
residence.
let
me
make
a
distinction
or
--
or
draw
a
distinction
between
the
normal
search
warrant
process
and
the
suggestion
that
the
appellant
makes
here
that
we
obtained
some
other
kind
of
warrant.
now,
the
minute
we
move
into
the
search
warrant
process,
the
first
thing
we
have
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
when
we
--
there's
--
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
an
inspector
going
to
a
house
owner
and
saying,
“may
i
inspect?”
and
the
inspector
or
same
official
with
a
warrant
saying,
“it's
time
now
to
get
in”.
this
is
hard
to
put
in
words
but
a
--
from
personal
experience
there
is
nothing
more
officious
than
someone
with
the
court
process.
we're
talking
about
the
feelings
of
the
individuals
within
the
house
or
within
the
business.
it's
a
more
severe
process
to
enter
with
judicial
process
than
it
is
to
ask
permission
to
enter.
and
that's
actually
what
happens
here.
mr.
see
said
no
when
the
firemen
asked
him
permission
to
enter.
and
he
continued
to
say
no.
and
he
come
later
in
a
formal
demand
and
a
formal
refusal
by
a
letter.
now,
this
is
much
different
and
what
happened
if
--
our
lieutenant
from
a
leather
company
showed
up
at
mr.
see's
warehouse
with
his
warrant.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
if
--
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
more
severe,
your
honor.
in
the
san
francisco
case,
the
property
owner
put
the
inspector
off
three
times
for
whatever
reason.
i
asked
a
question
by
way
of
answering
how
may
times
does
the
inspector
with
a
warrant
is
going
to
be
put
off?
not
at
all,
and
now
this
doesn't
matter
whether
we
come
with
--
in
with
our
warrant
first
or
we
come
in
with
our
warrant
second.
now,
the
--
the
warrant
process
itself,
when
i
go
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
i
go
ex
parte.
i
take
my
justification
up.
i
give
the
justification
to
the
administrative
officer
and
whatever
the
reasons
are
under
oath,
if
the
judge
will
have
to
agree
they
accept
the
facts
as
determination
of
one
of
the
probable
cause
from
the
facts.
there
may
well
be
some
reason
why
the
inspector
shouldn't
come
in
today
or
this
month.
and
it
may
well
rate
--
relate
to
fourth,
first,
or
fifth
amendment
freedoms.
but
in
any
event,
those
considerations
are
not
before
the
court
in
the
ex
parte
search
warrant
proceedings.
the
next
question
here
on
our
--
in
our
search
warrant,
well
how
about
our
question
of
probable
cause?
in
a
sense,
i
was
delighted
with
the
first
case
because
it's
either
no
inspections
on
a
routine
basis
or
an
inspection
only
on
the
same
showing
with
a
probable
cause
according
to
the
appellant
and
a
probable
legal
cause.
appellant
here
is
a
bit
more
reasonable
in
saying,
“well
a
spot
check
or
a
--
a
routine
inspection
program.”
my
suggestion
here
is
that
the
routine
inspection
program
can
be
put
into
a
mimeographed
warrant,
a
mimeographed
justification
and
i
can
leave
blank
in
that
mimeograph
the
number
of
the
house
and
possibly
the
name
of
the
person
although
i
don't
see
why
i
need
it,
because
this
isn't
a
personal
process
and
a
blank
for
signatures.
now,
what's
the
--
the
city
of
seattle
adopts
an
annual
fire
inspection
program
that
becomes
the
justification.
and
i
cannot
see
how
that
justification
becomes
any
better
or
any
less
better
or
this
routine
inspection
becomes
better
or
worse,
or
the
protection
for
the
propety
owner
becomes
more
or
less
when
this
mimeographed
form
is
submitted
to
a
magistrate
to
sign
in
accordance
with
the
annual
inspection
program,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
real
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
no,
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
if
i
were.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
if
i
were
to
do
it.
let's
look
at
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
is
the
precise
extent
of
his
authority
now.
and
the
question
is,
will
he
abuse
his
authority
under
the
ordinance
or
will
he
abuse
his
authority
under
this
so-called
search
warrant?
my
answer
is
that
if
he's
going
to
abuse
it
in
the
first
place,
he's
going
to
it
abuse
it
in
the
second.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
our
particular
case
i
--
i
think
he
knows
any
way
when
he
shows
up
in
his
fire
uniform.
these
are
not
unidentified
people.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it
was
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
best
answer
i
can
make
to
that
is
that
the
homeowner
who
will
insist
on
a
warrant
will
be
the
same
own
--
homeowner,
who
under
our
present
systems,
ask
the
inspector
what's
the
extent
of
your
authority.
and
if
they
have
any
doubt
as
to
it,
they
send
him
away
to
come
back
another
day.
this
is
the
ultimate
protection
and
i
submit
it's
a
protection
that's
not
fair
with
the
warrant
process.
and
it's
one
that
the
judicial
officer,
the
magistrate
cannot
import
into
the
inspection
process.
we
lose
more
than
we
gain
by
an
inspection
warrant.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
stated
by
the
appellant,
the
ordinance
before
the
court
today
is
the
seattle
fire
code.
generally
speaking
this
ordinance
regulates
the
handling
of
combustible
materials
and
liquids.
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
certain
buildings,
the
equipment
that
must
be
put
into
plants
and
warehouses
and
apartment
houses,
and
what
we
refer
to
as
highlight
for
occupancies,
all
in
connection
with
fire
prevention
activities.
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
is
directed
towards
flammable
and
explosive
materials
and
liquids.
the
method
of
obtaining
compliance
with
this
ordinance
is
one
that's
been
in
existence
in
the
cities
since
about
1884
in
one
form
or
another.
today,
it
involves
a
fire
inspection
program.
virtually
every
member
of
the
seattle
fire
department,
it
is
involved
in
this
inspection
program
and
it
goes
on
during
the
non-winter
months
of
the
year.
the
object
of
the
ordinance
is
remedial
and
not
punitive.
we
are
not
attempting
here
to
--
or
our
object
here
is
not
to
put
people
in
jail
or
to
put
fines
on
our
citizens
but
to
attempt
to
cure
a
defect,
or
error
of
omission
if
you
please
before
the
fire
actually
occurs.
the
ultimate
goal
then
is
one
of
cooperative
compliance
not
penalty.
when
we
look
at
mr.
see's
warehouse,
the
fire
department
didn't
come
to
his
warehouse
and
ask
for
an
inspection.
demand
is
one
way
to
put
it,
request
is
another
way.
there
was
no
immediate
entry
into
the
warehouse,
it's
been
some
three
years
now
and
the
fire
department
is
still
not
in
the
warehouse.
what
are
we
talking
about
in
sense
of
--
of
the
interest
of
these
men
in
this
warehouse.
a
warehouse
is
a
possessory
of
right
of
property
interest.
we're
not
talking
about
intimate
personal
relationships;
we're
talking
solely
about
property
rights.
we
don't
have
the
problem
here
of
the
young
lady
at
the
door
who
is
afraid
of
who
is
going
to
come
in.
we
look
at
the
fourth
amendment,
we
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
seattle
ordinance
has
interfered
with
mr.
see's
security
and
his
person,
his
house,
his
paper,
or
his
personal
effect.
we
find
out
that
if
there
is
an
interference
it's
one
with
a
“property
right”
such
as
it
maybe.
now,
historically
in
this
country,
inspections
have
been
accepted
as
non-fourth
amendment
process.
principally,
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
directed
at
criminal
prosecutions
and
the
accumulation
of
evidence
for
those
prosecutions.
while
in
some
of
the
cases,
particularly
frank,
abuses
this
type
of
inspection
process
are
being
predicted.
the
facts
are
that
these
abuses
have
not
arisen.
mr.
see
here
does
not
claim
that
the
fire
department
was
harassing
him,
that
they
broke
down
his
door,
that
he
came
at
a
non-reasonable
time,
that
they
were
other
than
harassing
then
repeated
that
they
were
picking
on
him
for
some
particular
violations.
in
fact,
they
did
not
know
whether
or
not
mr.
see
had
violated
the
ordinance.
we're
getting
here
to
the
point
that
the
fire
inspector,
at
the
time
these
firemen
did
not
know
whether
or
not
mr.
see
had
a
fire
hazard
within
his
building.
he
does
not
know
the
contents.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we
take
the
attitude
that
the
--
and
the
supreme
court
analyzed
it
this
way.
while
the
word
reasonableness
is
not
in
the
ordinance,
this
is
an
implied
requirement
by
law
that
the
ordinance,
the
inspection
provisions
of
the
ordinance
be
administered
reasonably.
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
right
to
force
entry
into
mr.
see's
warehouse.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
pardon
me.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
other
words
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
the
interpretation
of
the
ordinance.
if
there
were
a
particular
conviction
there
would
be
a
requirement
that
the
inspection
have
been
a
reasonable
inspection.
that
you
can't
imply
into
the
ordinance
that
it
authorizes
unreasonable
inspections.
this
is
our
alternative
and
my
point
is
that
any
enforcement
and
the
practical
enforcement
of
this
ordinance
there
will
be
a
requirement
that
each
area
of
the
inspection
process
be
reasonable
and
to
the
extent
that
it
becomes
then
unreasonable,
it
becomes
outside
the
legislative
authority.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
there
is
a
difference
in
the
analysis
of
the
issue.
the
point
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
let
me
state
my
point
so
it's
clearer.
i'm
stating
that
the
inspection
progress
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
yes
sir.
the
inspection
process
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
the
final
analysis,
no.
the
inspection
process
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
prohibited
procedure.
because
it
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it
is
not
a
procedure
prohibited
or
proscribe
by
the
fourth
amendment.
so
long
as
we're
dealing
with
safety
inspections
of
buildings
and
we
do
not
touch
the
person,
we
do
not
interfere
with
the
intimate
relationships
of
his
home,
we
do
not
interfere
with
his
papers
or
his
effects.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it's
an
inspection.
it's
not
a
search
and
seizure.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
there's
no
difference
in
the
analysis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
this
case
becomes
easier
to
--
to
decide
because
we
may
not
get
into
the
areas
of
rights
of
privacy
and
the
--
and
the
intimate
relationships
of
alike.
this
makes
a
lot
a
difference
but
the
--
my
provision
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
how
we
say
we
do
it,
yes
your
honor.
but
it's
because
we're
interfering
with
these
items
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
these
one
is
easier
because
it's
more
clear
that
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
person,
his
house,
his
person,
his
papers
or
his
effects.
when
you
get
to
the
home
situation
--
that
situation,
if
the
analysis
becomes
more
difficult
of
what
--
if
we
look
back
into
history,
we
find
out
that
these
inspections
have
been
accepted.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct.
unless
we
--
unless
we
have
troubles
with
our
analysis
of
the
right
to
privacy.
and
i
suggest
the
court
has
had
troubles
in
this
area.
it's
not
that
clear
a
proposition.
until
we
--
unless
we
stick
with
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment,
person,
house,
papers
and
effects,
we
have
an
extremely
dif
--
difficult
issue.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
i
wouldn't
agree
to
that
proposition
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
any
time
you
move
into
the
criminal
process.
in
other
words,
we're
talking
about
the
penal
process,
we're
moving
against
the
person.
we
make
the
difference
or
we
make
the
statement
in
our
brief
that
there's
a
major
difference
between
something
in
random.
we
look
at
the
--
the
structure
of
a
building.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
activities
that
are
carried
on
inside
the
warehouse.
now,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
activities
inside
the
house.
we
are
concerned
with
the
construction
of
the
walls.
we're
concerned
with
its
plumbing,
but
were
not
concerned
with
his
person,
his
papers
or
his
personal
effects.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we're
concerned
with
the
chemical
content
of
that
personal
effect.
that's
true.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
content
of
those
personal
effects.
we
will
tell
him
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
storage
of
that
chemical
material
close
to
that
fire
presents
a
fire
hazard.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
for
seizing
or
searching
those
papers,
we
don't
touch
it.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
and
he
says
we
should
leave
him
alone
and
i
agree
that
the
government
should
leave
him
alone.
i
do
not
agree
that
he
has
a
right
to
keep
those
papers
that
close
to
the
fire
if
in
fact
we
agree
that
a
hazard
which
enda
--
endangers
the
entire
neighborhood.
this
is
the
point.
it's
not
what's
in
the
papers
and
it's
not
what
is
in
his
books.
it's
not
whether
the
alcohol
that
he
has
in
a
particular
can
is
seasoned
or
otherwise,
it's
the
chemical
nature
of
it
that
creates
a
fire
hazard
or
the
explosion
hazard.
and
this
is
what
we
are
concerned
with.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
no
sir.
he
would
get
a
notice
to
correct
the
deficiency.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
--
the
explosives
requires
a
special
permit
to
store.
if
he
told
the
inspectors
that
those
are
cases
of
m1
ammunitions,
he
would
get
an
instruction
immediately
to
take
out
the
permit
and
when
he
got
his
permit
he
must
store
them
in
accordance
with
the
permit.
now,
i
--
i
spoke
of
the
compliance
with
the
fire
inspection
ordinances
or
the
fire
prevention
ordinances
as
being
primarily
a
voluntary
type
of
encouragement
to
get
people
to
cooperate
in
eliminating
fires
and
explosions.
normally,
i
would
say
that
he
would
take
out
his
permit
and
construct
the
necessary
walls
to
protect
this.
if
he
did
not,
then
we
come
to
the
ultimate
of
the
process
and
then
we
would
be
forced
to
take
him
into
court
and
say
that
you're
storing
ammunition
without
a
permit.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that's
correct.
i
--
that's
what
i
state.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
page
19
of
the
record
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
this
case.
it
should
be
noted
that
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
seizure
of
evidence
for
use
of
--
in
court
and
there
is
no
threat
of
criminal
penalty
even
if
the
fire
hazards
were
detected.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
you
said
would
we
arrest
him
and
put
him
in
jail.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
supreme
court
instruction
to
this
says
that
--
we
must
give
the
notice
first,
and
if
the
violation
of
the
notice
that
constitutes
then
the
crime.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
our
building
code
says
that,
yes
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
as
a
furtherance
of
the
fire
code.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
one
of
the
fire
inspections?
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we
don't
have
inspections
such
as
this
in
connection
with
our
building
code.
there
are
different
types
of
inspections.
now,
the
case
here
today
is
a
fire
inspection.
now,
the
building
inspection,
we
may
have
an
entirely
different
case
under
our
building
code
and
that
inspection
ordinance.
we
may
have
an
entirely
different
case
than
we
have
today.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
when
a
fireman
goes
into
the
--
the
commercial
premises
under
this
ordinance.
we're
talking
about
under
the
fire
code
and
under
this
inspection
authorization.
the
only
thing
he
may
do
when
he
gets
through
is
to
give
a
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
then
he
will
be
prosecuted
if
there's
not
a
correction
within
the
reasonable
time.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
difference
between
the
first
time
and
the
second
time,
the
second
time
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
second
entry
will
be
--
it
may
be
denied.
but
then
we
have
the
notice
and
we
have
the
violation
theoretically
and
the
non
--
the
non-conformance.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
no
sir.
not
if
he
refuses.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
he
could
--
not
under
washington
law,
he
could
not
get
a
warrant.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
what's
--
if
--
if
we
assume
we
waive
the
--
the
question
of
the
consent
of
the
entry
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
now,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
had
this
argument
before
them
too.
they
are
on
page
26
of
the
record.
the
supreme
court
said,
“the
related
issues
and
knowledge
gained
by
the
inspection
for
possible
use
in
any
subsequent
criminal
cases.”
that
is
the
question
we
do
not
pass
upon
at
this
time
since
it
is
not
before
us.
now,
whereas
that
the
defendant
here
or
the
appellant
has
not
been
prosecuted
for
violation
of
the
ordinance.
we
are
not
in
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
--
pinpoint
an
answer.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
one
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
one
state
court
did
have
to
face
up
to
the
problem
and
the
case
is
now
on
the
calendar.
and
they
found
a
particular
solution
not
that
i
necessarily
agree
with
it
but
the
solution
was
found
to
solve
this
particular
problem.
once
they
had
permitted
the
entry,
what
happens
in
the
subsequent
crimi
--criminal
prosecution
to
the
evidence
of
this
variety?
the
point
i
would
make
when
we
do
get
there
is
in
that
entry
it
was
there
any
insecurity,
or
was
there
an
interference
with
the
security
if
this
person,
his
paper
or
his
personal
effects?
as
to
mr.
see,
i
will
say
no.
but
as
i
say
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
get
to
this
particular
question.
i
would
like
to
take
a
minute
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
that
--
i
beg
it
is
different
with
you
there
sir.
that's
not
correct.
it's
dicta
in
the
case.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it's
dicta
in
the
case.
this
was
read
out
of
the
see
case,
the
statement
that
a
warrant
is
required.
when
we
get
to
that
point
in
the
state
court,
we
will
be
faced
with
the
statutory
process
for
the
issuance
of
warrants
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
this
is
an
extremely
limited
process
and
i
would
like
to
spell
it
out
to
the
court,
if
i
might,
right
here
to
show
you
what
--
what
we're
concerned
with.
you
can
get
a
warrant
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
counsel
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
they
have
but
not
in
the
case
before
that.
because
we
were
not
into
a
residential
house
and
we've
not
try
to
get
into
a
residential
premises
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
--
at
that
time.
that
question
of
how
to
get
in
to
a
residence
was
not
argued.
and
when
the
courts
decide
questions
like
this,
we
get
into
trouble
and
it
takes
us
more
time
to
search
(voice
overlap).
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
there's
no
law
on
it
at
all,
on
how
you
get
into
--
how
you
show
probable
cause
and
to
whom
in
order
to
gain
entry
to
a
house
for
a
fire
inspection.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
my
position
is
res
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
he
could
have,
but
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
but
for
the
ordinance
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it
says
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
but
for
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
well,
we
have
no
cases
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
we
have
never
been
into
the
problem.
we
don't
go
into
residences.
we
don't
go
into
residences
under
the
fire
code
even
in
apartment
buildings.
the
question
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
been
raised
in
connection
with
an
urban
renewal
housing
inspection
program,
so
that
the
legal
issue
to
be
passed
on
by
the
court
just
has
never
been
there.
as
i
say
this
is
dicta
in
the
case
because
we
were
not
here
dealing
with
a
residence.
let
me
make
a
distinction
or
--
or
draw
a
distinction
between
the
normal
search
warrant
process
and
the
suggestion
that
the
appellant
makes
here
that
we
obtained
some
other
kind
of
warrant.
now,
the
minute
we
move
into
the
search
warrant
process,
the
first
thing
we
have
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
when
we
--
there's
--
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
an
inspector
going
to
a
house
owner
and
saying,
“may
i
inspect?”
and
the
inspector
or
same
official
with
a
warrant
saying,
“it's
time
now
to
get
in”.
this
is
hard
to
put
in
words
but
a
--
from
personal
experience
there
is
nothing
more
officious
than
someone
with
the
court
process.
we're
talking
about
the
feelings
of
the
individuals
within
the
house
or
within
the
business.
it's
a
more
severe
process
to
enter
with
judicial
process
than
it
is
to
ask
permission
to
enter.
and
that's
actually
what
happens
here.
mr.
see
said
no
when
the
firemen
asked
him
permission
to
enter.
and
he
continued
to
say
no.
and
he
come
later
in
a
formal
demand
and
a
formal
refusal
by
a
letter.
now,
this
is
much
different
and
what
happened
if
--
our
lieutenant
from
a
leather
company
showed
up
at
mr.
see's
warehouse
with
his
warrant.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
if
--
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
more
severe,
your
honor.
in
the
san
francisco
case,
the
property
owner
put
the
inspector
off
three
times
for
whatever
reason.
i
asked
a
question
by
way
of
answering
how
may
times
does
the
inspector
with
a
warrant
is
going
to
be
put
off?
not
at
all,
and
now
this
doesn't
matter
whether
we
come
with
--
in
with
our
warrant
first
or
we
come
in
with
our
warrant
second.
now,
the
--
the
warrant
process
itself,
when
i
go
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
i
go
ex
parte.
i
take
my
justification
up.
i
give
the
justification
to
the
administrative
officer
and
whatever
the
reasons
are
under
oath,
if
the
judge
will
have
to
agree
they
accept
the
facts
as
determination
of
one
of
the
probable
cause
from
the
facts.
there
may
well
be
some
reason
why
the
inspector
shouldn't
come
in
today
or
this
month.
and
it
may
well
rate
--
relate
to
fourth,
first,
or
fifth
amendment
freedoms.
but
in
any
event,
those
considerations
are
not
before
the
court
in
the
ex
parte
search
warrant
proceedings.
the
next
question
here
on
our
--
in
our
search
warrant,
well
how
about
our
question
of
probable
cause?
in
a
sense,
i
was
delighted
with
the
first
case
because
it's
either
no
inspections
on
a
routine
basis
or
an
inspection
only
on
the
same
showing
with
a
probable
cause
according
to
the
appellant
and
a
probable
legal
cause.
appellant
here
is
a
bit
more
reasonable
in
saying,
“well
a
spot
check
or
a
--
a
routine
inspection
program.”
my
suggestion
here
is
that
the
routine
inspection
program
can
be
put
into
a
mimeographed
warrant,
a
mimeographed
justification
and
i
can
leave
blank
in
that
mimeograph
the
number
of
the
house
and
possibly
the
name
of
the
person
although
i
don't
see
why
i
need
it,
because
this
isn't
a
personal
process
and
a
blank
for
signatures.
now,
what's
the
--
the
city
of
seattle
adopts
an
annual
fire
inspection
program
that
becomes
the
justification.
and
i
cannot
see
how
that
justification
becomes
any
better
or
any
less
better
or
this
routine
inspection
becomes
better
or
worse,
or
the
protection
for
the
propety
owner
becomes
more
or
less
when
this
mimeographed
form
is
submitted
to
a
magistrate
to
sign
in
accordance
with
the
annual
inspection
program,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
real
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
no,
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
if
i
were.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
if
i
were
to
do
it.
let's
look
at
--
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
this
is
the
precise
extent
of
his
authority
now.
and
the
question
is,
will
he
abuse
his
authority
under
the
ordinance
or
will
he
abuse
his
authority
under
this
so-called
search
warrant?
my
answer
is
that
if
he's
going
to
abuse
it
in
the
first
place,
he's
going
to
it
abuse
it
in
the
second.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
in
our
particular
case
i
--
i
think
he
knows
any
way
when
he
shows
up
in
his
fire
uniform.
these
are
not
unidentified
people.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
it
was
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
mr.
a.
l.
newbould
the
best
answer
i
can
make
to
that
is
that
the
homeowner
who
will
insist
on
a
warrant
will
be
the
same
own
--
homeowner,
who
under
our
present
systems,
ask
the
inspector
what's
the
extent
of
your
authority.
and
if
they
have
any
doubt
as
to
it,
they
send
him
away
to
come
back
another
day.
this
is
the
ultimate
protection
and
i
submit
it's
a
protection
that's
not
fair
with
the
warrant
process.
and
it's
one
that
the
judicial
officer,
the
magistrate
cannot
import
into
the
inspection
process.
we
lose
more
than
we
gain
by
an
inspection
warrant.
thank
you.
