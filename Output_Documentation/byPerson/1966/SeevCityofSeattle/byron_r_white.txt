justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
dorsen,
what
if
you
have
this
particular
statute
but
you
have
an
administrative
arrangement,
a
set
of
regulations
issued
by
the
health
people
saying
where
every
year
we
do
--
we
do
--
and
it
turns
out
that
this
inspection
in
this
case
was
a
routine
annual
inspection
according
to
the
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
he
could
get
this
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
--
i
take
it,
if
there
was
a
warrant
before
him
that
the
warrants
could
issue
on
the
complaints
on
specific
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
would
you
agree
with
that?
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
dorsen
what
if
there's
a
legislative
judgment
in
the
statute
or
in
an
ordinance
that
says
--
that
says
ins
--
inspect
every
year
because
we
think
within
the
period
of
a
year
that
enough
can
happen
to
a
dwelling
that
requires
inspection.
then
there's
a
legislative
judgment
that's
possibly
can
--
would
--
would
justify
in
inspection,
would
that
be
enough
reason
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
--
that's
what
i
mean.
that
it'd
be
enough
to
give
a
warrant
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
now
--
what
about
--
lets
us
say
he
gives
the
notice
of
deficiency.
then
when
he
comes
back
he
wants
in
again.
then
in
--
then
--
the
chief
justice
question
is
certainly
pertinent
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
should
he
be
able
to
get
him
in
the
next
time
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
--
in
this
term
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
really
you
get
--
you
say
you
can
get
in
the
second
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
even
in
--
can
--
can
he
get
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you'd
said
yes
to
this
particular
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
case
before
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
