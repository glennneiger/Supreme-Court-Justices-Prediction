did
any

did
anybody
live

wouldn't
it?

as

justice

stewart
well,
that's
--
aren't
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
--
aren't
you
not
only
subverting
but
cheapening
and
degrading
the
values
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
you
say
that
the
reasonable
cause
could
be
shown
just
by
the
desire
to
make
a
spot
check?
justice
potter
stewart
those
periodic
inspections,
certainly,
you
can't
do
that
of
the
--
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
no,
not
in
real
cases.
it's
ever
been
decided
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
is.
justice
potter
stewart
something
--
something
other
than
probable
cause,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
seems
to
me
that
if
you
can
just
show,
we
haven't
inspected
this
place
for
a
year.
and
if
that's
enough
under
the
fourth
amendment
then
you're
completely
subverting
the
values
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
with
--
it
was
just
a
spot
check,
a
periodic
random
spot
check
be
a
reasonable
plan.
that's
certainly
a
very
accepted
way
of
operating
in
--
in
areas
like
checking
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
keep
--
kept
precious
random
spot
check.
justice
potter
stewart
and
be
easily
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
fourth
amendment
requires
nothing
more
than
a
--
an
automatic
rubberstamp
on
a
piece
of
paper,
we're
not
talking
about
it
very
much
in
this
case,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
the
problem
would
be
really
if
--
if
somebody
comes
to
your
door
under
the
warrant
you
have
very
little
choice
about
whether
or
not
you
would
let
him
in.
and
if
he
comes
there
simply
as
an
inspector
under
a
statute
you
perhaps
have
more
choice.
you
can
--
about
finding
out
whether
he
really
is
an
inspector
or
if
he's
an
impostor.
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
can
say,
“i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
in
until
you
show
me
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
fire
department.”
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
i
say,
if
somebody
comes
to
your
house
with
a
warrant
which
you
say
can
be
--
as
i
understand
you
can
be
issued
by
a
magistrate
at
simply
upon
the
showing
of
the
fire
department
that
we're
making
a
random
irrational
spot
check
of
various
building
in
the
city,
and
this
is
one
of
the
buildings
and
then
the
warrant
issued
and
you
show
up
at
that
building
and
that
person
hasn't
got
any
choice
but
let
you
in.
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
a
duty
to
let
you
in
then.
justice
potter
stewart
whereas
if
the
--
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
and
no
matter
how
convenient
it
may
be
for
him.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
--
my
question
was
this,
that
if
you're
right
that
all
that's
required
is
a
warrant
then
you
come
with
a
warrant
and
the
person
has
a
duty
as
you
say
to
let
this
man
in
if
he
has
a
warrant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whereas
under
the
existing
statute
without
a
warrant,
it
would
seem
to
me,
he
has
no
such
duty.
he
can
say,
“i
don't
know
whether
or
not
you're
a
member
the
fire
department
besides
that
i'm
having
dinner,
come
back
at
some
other
time.”
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
you
would
agree
that
here
in
washington
where
there
are
good
many
people
nowadays
concerned
with
the
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
crime
that
the
commissioner
couldn't
pass
a
resolution
saying
with
a
lot
of
warehouses
about
the
increase
of
crime
and
until
the
police
thereby
or
therefore
are
hereby
authorized
to
enter
any
house
at
random.
they
spot
checks
to
see
if
there's
any
criminal
activity
going
on.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
prevalence
if
there's
a
danger
of
increasing
fires
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
in
a
fire
hazard
there
was
a
lot
of
ammunition
and
bombs
in
there,
what
would
you
do?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
dorsen,
i
suppose
your
argument
would
lead
to
our
requirement
that
a
meter
reader
would
have
a
search
warrant
to
come
in
and
read
the
water
meter.
if
he
were
a
public
official
of
the
city
--
city
water
system.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
the
search
warrant,
in
order
to
get
a
search
warrant
how
--
would
you
have
to
allege
as
simply
that
you
haven't
read
the
meter
in
a
month?
justice
potter
stewart
what
possibly
is
then
is
the
purpose
of
the
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
to
do
with
the
householders'
convenience.
and
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
suggested
to
you
that
the
--
the
present
statute
from
the
point
of
view
of
householders'
convenience
gives
much
preference
to
a
warrant
because
a
man
armed
with
a
warrant
can
come
in
despite
the
householders'
inconvenience.
justice
potter
stewart
in
new
york,
i
gather,
you
don't
have
them?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
for
water,
--
but
i'm--
i'm
hypothesizing
a
city
water
system
where
the
meter
itself
usually
belongs
to
the
water
company
but
it's
located
inside
the
--
the

a

justice

yes.
