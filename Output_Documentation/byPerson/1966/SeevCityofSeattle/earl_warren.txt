norman
see,
appellant,
versus
city
of
seattle.
mr.
dorsen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
anything
except
dwellings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
was
a
--
open
business
for
people
who'd
come
and
go,
would
you
still
say
they
have
no
right
to
go
in
and
inspect
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
newbould.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
feel
there's
constitutional
difference
between
your
situation
here
and
the
one
who
are
at
--
was
a
dwelling?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
that
--
is
there
a
constitutional
difference.
you
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
this
could
not
apply
to
dwellings.
that
it
only
applies
to
businesses.
now,
by
that,
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
deference
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
answer
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
is
there
are
a
difference
or
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
so
far
--
far
as
we
are
concerned
then
there
is
no
distinction
between
your
case
and
the
case
we
just
have
heard.
because
one
has
to
do
with
a
dwelling
and
this
one
has
to
do
purely
with
a
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
possibly
we
do
that
--
we
do
that
because
of
our
constitutional
questions,
don't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
one
is
the
issue
because
it
doesn't
have
that
constitutional
question,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
also
though
that
if
you
found
that
this
fire
hazard
was
caused
by
him
in
violation
of
law,
you
might
arrest
him
for
it,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
that
under
those
circumstances
could
they
arrest
him
for
any
violation
of
--
of
the
building
code,
when
they
found
those
violations
under
inspection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
provision
of
your
law
prohibits
them
from
doing
it?
aren't
there
some
violations
that
subject
the
man
to
punishment
for
those
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
doesn't
decide
the
point
what
i
asked
you
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said,
could
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
doesn't
say
you
can't.
what
you
just
read
certainly
doesn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
ordinances
that
say
if
a
man
does
so
and
so
in
violation
of
the
building
code
that
he
shall
be
--
he
shall
be
prosecuted
and
if
convicted,
punished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
what
is
it
that
--
that
says
that
those
provisions
are
not
valid
that
--
that
you
can't
do
it
in
that
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
your
statute
says
that
if
a
man
does
certain
things
in
violation
of
the
building
code
he
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
now,
what
is
it
that
says
that
he
can't
be
prosecuted
thus
a
misdemeanor
if
it's
found
in
one
of
these
inspections?
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
inspection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
you
--
so
you
can't
say
that
--
that
he
goes
in
there
to
inspect,
he's
just
going
in
there
to
see
if
everything
is
alright
and
if
it
isn't
alright
to
tell
the
man
to
make
it
right,
because
if
he
doesn't,
violations
in
there
that
there
were
both
deliberate.
isn't
he
subjected
to
the
penalties
to
those
arguments
as
you
just
mentioned
to
me?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
newbould,
may
i
ask
you
on
--
under
the
ordinance,
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
inspect
a
--
a
dwelling
in
the
same
manner
in
which
you
do
a
business.
and
your
argument
provides
that
they
must
have
probable
cause
in
order
to
investigate
it
or
to
inspect
a
building.
and
as
i
understood
your
supreme
court
has
held
that
that
means
they
have
to
have
a
warrant
if
they
want
to
inspect
this,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
--
i
didn't
state
that
that's
a
fact
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
either
your
counsel
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
statement
that
the
court
had
interpreted
it
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
far
as
you
know
that's
the
only
evidence,
we
only
--
the
court
law
there
is
on
the
subject,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
of
washington
recognized
that
under
this
ordinance
a
homeowner
has
the
right
to
demand
an
ordinance,
demand
a
--
a
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what's
the
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
fact
that
they
were
entitled
to
demand
the
warrant
would
mean
that
every
household
you
would
have
to
present
a
warrant
to
every
businessman
or
every
household
within
it
then
we
would
go
to
them
and
say
you
want
to
inspect.
then
i
suppose
99
out
of
a
100
people
which
says
they
always
have
that
“go
ahead
and
inspect.”
but
if
a
person
did
demand
one,
well
then
you
could
have
the
--
the
search
warrant
and
--
and
that
he
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
say
and
if
that
was
any
more
severe
than
otherwise,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
would
at
least
show,
i
presume,
the
--
the
fact
that
the
search
was
a
--
was
authorized
and
i
suppose
that
if
--
would
you
designate
the
--
the
warrant
would
designate
the
extent
of
the
search.
i
suppose
that
if
the
city
had
a
--
have
a
--
an
ordinance
based
upon
the
experience
of
the
city
to
the
effect
that
certain
things
were
fire
hazards
and
they
were
very
common
in
the
city
and
they
were
investigated
in.
i
suppose
when
a
--
if
a
man
demanded
a
warrant,
search
warrant
and
the
court
issued
a
search
warrant,
then
one
issued
was
a
warrant
for
a
general
search
of
the
--
of
a
house,
it
issued
a
warrant
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
it
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
certain
fire
hazards
existed
there.
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
go
in
and
look
in
drawers
or
doors
and
--
and
things
of
that
kind
in
his
--
in
his
search,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
the
extent
of
--
of
the
home
--
of
the
building
would
at
least
know,
would
he
not?
what
the
extent
of
the
authority
was
that
they
gave
them
a
search
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
not
taking
just
this
man,
we're
taking
--
we're
taking
people
in
their
homes
and
in
their
--
in
their
businesses
and
they
don't
know
how
many
--
how
many
--
how
many
inspections
you
say
you
have?
i
have
forgotten,
it
was
mentioned,
wasn't
it?
how
many
you
have
in
the
city
of
seattle
or
was
it
in
the
city
of
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
san
francisco?
how
must
an
own
--
owner
know
what
they're
looking
for
when
they
come
in
--
into
his
--
into
their
homes?
but
if
they
have
a
search
warrant
says,
“this
man
is
a
--
is
a
--
a
fire
marshal.
he's
--
and
they're
going
to
your
home
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
are
the
electrical
fixtures
are
--
are
properly
installed
or
whether
there
are
any
fire
hazards.”
and
if
he
starts
looking
at
some
place
else,
you're
going
to
have
to
say
to
them,
“well
that
--that
isn't
included
in
this
warrant.
you're
looking
for
that.”
but
if
a
fellow
just
comes
in
and
said,
“here
i'm
--
i'm
here
to
inspect
your
home.”
he
walks
in
and
has
quite
blank
to
--
to
look
for
what
he
wants
and
the
owner
doesn't
know,
it
isn't
limited
by
--
by
any
authority
that's
given
to
him
that
the
owner
knows
anything
about,
how
can
he
protect
his
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
dorsen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorsen,
wouldn't
it
be
one
additional
protection
to
the
householder
if
he
has
a
warrant?
a
warrant
would
--
would
indicate
to
what
extent
the
--
the
officer
had
a
right
to
be
in
that
house?
i
suppose
the
search
warrant
you'd
say
that
he
--
he
was
authorized
to
enter
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
the
premises
to
see
if
these
safety
factors
was
there
or
if
he
just
comes
in
on
his
own
and
he
wants
to
--
to
inspect
the
--
the
house
and
he
goes
rummaging
around
in
other
--
other
things,
the
--
the
householder
would
have
no
--
no
way
to
stop
him
or
to
say,
“you
can't
go
any
farther
than
that,
you
haven't
got
the
authority
to
do
it.”
but
if
the
warrant
said
that
he
could
--
he
could
then
challenge
the
man's
right
to
do
something
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
under
his
inspection.
chief
justice

chief

it
says
anything
except

chief

well
--
chief

suppose
this

who'd

would
you

chief

very

mr.
newbould.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
feel
there's
constitutional
difference
between
your
situation
here
and
the
one
who
are
at
--
was
a
dwelling?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
that
--
is
there
a
constitutional
difference.
you
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
this
could
not
apply
to
dwellings.
that
it
only
applies
to
businesses.
now,
by
that,
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
deference
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
answer
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
is
there
are
a
difference
or
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
so
far
--
far
as
we
are
concerned
then
there
is
no
distinction
between
your
case
and
the
case
we
just
have
heard.
because
one
has
to
do
with
a
dwelling
and
this
one
has
to
do
purely
with
a
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
possibly
we
do
that
--
we
do
that
because
of
our
constitutional
questions,
don't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
one
is
the
issue
because
it
doesn't
have
that
constitutional
question,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
also
though
that
if
you
found
that
this
fire
hazard
was
caused
by
him
in
violation
of
law,
you
might
arrest
him
for
it,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
that
under
those
circumstances
could
they
arrest
him
for
any
violation
of
--
of
the
building
code,
when
they
found
those
violations
under
inspection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
provision
of
your
law
prohibits
them
from
doing
it?
aren't
there
some
violations
that
subject
the
man
to
punishment
for
those
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
doesn't
decide
the
point
what
i
asked
you
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said,
could
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
doesn't
say
you
can't.
what
you
just
read
certainly
doesn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
ordinances
that
say
if
a
man
does
so
and
so
in
violation
of
the
building
code
that
he
shall
be
--
he
shall
be
prosecuted
and
if
convicted,
punished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
what
is
it
that
--
that
says
that
those
provisions
are
not
valid
that
--
that
you
can't
do
it
in
that
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
your
statute
says
that
if
a
man
does
certain
things
in
violation
of
the
building
code
he
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
now,
what
is
it
that
says
that
he
can't
be
prosecuted
thus
a
misdemeanor
if
it's
found
in
one
of
these
inspections?
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
inspection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
you
--
so
you
can't
say
that
--
that
he
goes
in
there
to
inspect,
he's
just
going
in
there
to
see
if
everything
is
alright
and
if
it
isn't
alright
to
tell
the
man
to
make
it
right,
because
if
he
doesn't,
violations
in
there
that
there
were
both
deliberate.
isn't
he
subjected
to
the
penalties
to
those
arguments
as
you
just
mentioned
to
me?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
newbould,
may
i
ask
you
on
--
under
the
ordinance,
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
inspect
a
--
a
dwelling
in
the
same
manner
in
which
you
do
a
business.
and
your
argument
provides
that
they
must
have
probable
cause
in
order
to
investigate
it
or
to
inspect
a
building.
and
as
i
understood
your
supreme
court
has
held
that
that
means
they
have
to
have
a
warrant
if
they
want
to
inspect
this,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
--
i
didn't
state
that
that's
a
fact
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
either
your
counsel
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
statement
that
the
court
had
interpreted
it
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
far
as
you
know
that's
the
only
evidence,
we
only
--
the
court
law
there
is
on
the
subject,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
of
washington
recognized
that
under
this
ordinance
a
homeowner
has
the
right
to
demand
an
ordinance,
demand
a
--
a
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what's
the
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
fact
that
they
were
entitled
to
demand
the
warrant
would
mean
that
every
household
you
would
have
to
present
a
warrant
to
every
businessman
or
every
household
within
it
then
we
would
go
to
them
and
say
you
want
to
inspect.
then
i
suppose
99
out
of
a
100
people
which
says
they
always
have
that
“go
ahead
and
inspect.”
but
if
a
person
did
demand
one,
well
then
you
could
have
the
--
the
search
warrant
and
--
and
that
he
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
say
and
if
that
was
any
more
severe
than
otherwise,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
would
at
least
show,
i
presume,
the
--
the
fact
that
the
search
was
a
--
was
authorized
and
i
suppose
that
if
--
would
you
designate
the
--
the
warrant
would
designate
the
extent
of
the
search.
i
suppose
that
if
the
city
had
a
--
have
a
--
an
ordinance
based
upon
the
experience
of
the
city
to
the
effect
that
certain
things
were
fire
hazards
and
they
were
very
common
in
the
city
and
they
were
investigated
in.
i
suppose
when
a
--
if
a
man
demanded
a
warrant,
search
warrant
and
the
court
issued
a
search
warrant,
then
one
issued
was
a
warrant
for
a
general
search
of
the
--
of
a
house,
it
issued
a
warrant
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
it
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
certain
fire
hazards
existed
there.
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
go
in
and
look
in
drawers
or
doors
and
--
and
things
of
that
kind
in
his
--
in
his
search,
would
he?
chief

earl
warren
but
the
--
the
extent
of
--
of
the
home
--
of
the
building
would
at
least
know,
would
he
not?
what
the
extent
of
the
authority
was
that
they
gave
them
a
search
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
not
taking
just
this
man,
we're
taking
--
we're
taking
people
in
their
homes
and
in
their
--
in
their
businesses
and
they
don't
know
how
many
--
how
many
--
how
many
inspections
you
say
you
have?
i
have
forgotten,
it
was
mentioned,
wasn't
it?
how
many
you
have
in
the
city
of
seattle
or
was
it
in
the
city
of
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
san
francisco?
how
must
an
own
--
owner
know
what
they're
looking
for
when
they
come
in
--
into
his
--
into
their
homes?
but
if
they
have
a
search
warrant
says,
“this
man
is
a
--
is
a
--
a
fire
marshal.
he's
--
and
they're
going
to
your
home
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
are
the
electrical
fixtures
are
--
are
properly
installed
or
whether
there
are
any
fire
hazards.”
and
if
he
starts
looking
at
some
place
else,
you're
going
to
have
to
say
to
them,
“well
that
--that
isn't
included
in
this
warrant.
you're
looking
for
that.”
but
if
a
fellow
just
comes
in
and
said,
“here
i'm
--
i'm
here
to
inspect
your
home.”
he
walks
in
and
has
quite
blank
to
--
to
look
for
what
he
wants
and
the
owner
doesn't
know,
it
isn't
limited
by
--
by
any
authority
that's
given
to
him
that
the
owner
knows
anything
about,
how
can
he
protect
his
rights?

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorsen,
wouldn't
it
be
one
additional
protection
to
the
householder
if
he
has
a
warrant?
a
warrant
would
--
would
indicate
to
what
extent
the
--
the
officer
had
a
right
to
be
in
that
house?
i
suppose
the
search
warrant
you'd
say
that
he
--
he
was
authorized
to
enter
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
the
premises
to
see
if
these
safety
factors
was
there
or
if
he
just
comes
in
on
his
own
and
he
wants
to
--
to
inspect
the
--
the
house
and
he
goes
rummaging
around
in
other
--
other
things,
the
--
the
householder
would
have
no
--
no
way
to
stop
him
or
to
say,
“you
can't
go
any
farther
than
that,
you
haven't
got
the
authority
to
do
it.”
but
if
the
warrant
said
that
he
could
--
he
could
then
challenge
the
man's
right
to
do
something
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
under
his
inspection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
