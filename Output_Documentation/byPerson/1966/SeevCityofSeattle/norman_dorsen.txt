mr.
norman
dorsen
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
companion
case
to
number
92,
camara
which
was
heard
before
the
luncheon
recess.
this
is
the
fire
inspection
case.
it
arises
under
the
fire
code
of
seattle
washington.
the
same
basic
question
is
presented
under
somewhat
different
ordinance
whether
the
constitution
protects
citizens
against
unwarranted
searches.
and
unwarranted
search
is
stated
in
two
senses,
one
without
a
search
warrant
and
two
without
any
reasonable
cause
to
enter.
the
statute
in
issue
is
on
page
5
of
the
record
and
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
the
court.
8.01.050
inspection
of
buildings
and
premises:
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
fire
chief
to
inspect,
and
he
may
enter
all
buildings
and
premises
except
the
interiors
of
dwellings
as
often
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
and
causing
to
be
corrected
any
conditions
liable
to
cause
fire
or
any
violations
to
the
provisions
of
this
title
and
of
any
other
ordinance
concerning
fire
hazards.
there
are
a
couple
of
other
ordinances
and
they're
also
in
the
record
at
the
end
of
the
fire
code.
the
appellant
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
except
dwel
--
dwellings
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
appellant,
mr.
see
was
convicted
under
8.01.140
which
appears
at
page
11
of
the
record.
it
says,
“anyone
violating
or
failing
to
comply
with
any
provision
of
this
title
or
a
lawful
order
of
the
fire
chief
shall
upon
conviction
thereof
be
punishable
by
a
fine
not
to
exceed
$300
or
imprisonment
in
the
city
jail
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
90
days,
or
by
both
such
fine
and
imprisonment,
and
each
day
of
violation
shall
con
--
constitute
a
separate
offense.
in
the
light
of
the
case
you
heard
this
morning
and
the
light
of
frank
v.
maryland
and
eaton
v.
price,
it
is
apparent
that
this
ordinance
is
in
a
sense
the
ultimate
weapon
of
municipalities
because
unlike
the
ordinance
in
frank
v.
maryland,
this
ordinance
does
not
have
any
of
the
finely
tailored
provisions.
it
does
not
have
a
provision
providing
that
the
inspector
must
have
reasonable
cause
to
find
the
nuisance.
it
doesn't
even
provide
that
the
inspection
take
place
at
reasonable
times
and
each
of
the
four
other
ordinances
before
this
court
have
such
a
provision.
the
eaton
ordinance,
the
frank
ordinance,
the
camara
ordinance
and
the
ordinance
in
hadley
v.
city
of
malden
of
massachusetts
which
was
filed
in
january
and
it's
on
the
miscellaneous
docket.
not
only
that,
that
this
ordinance
says
nothing
about
credentials.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
ordinance
which
is
completely
open-ended
as
far
as
the
power
of
inspection
is
concerned.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
stipulated,
they
were
stipulated
from
the
start
and
they
appear
on
pages
1
and
2
of
the
record.
mr.
see,
the
appellant,
is
the
owner
of
a
private
warehouse
in
the
city
of
seattle.
the
fire
department,
to
its
authorized
representative
demanded
the
defendant
that
an
inspection
be
allowed
as
to
the
premises.
the
fire
department
did
not
procure
a
search
warrant
and
it
made
no
claim
that
the
fire
department
had
any
reasonable
cause
to
believe
a
violation
of
the
ordinance
existed
at
the
time
of
the
demand.
the
appellant
refused
to
admit
the
inspection.
eventually
a
warrant
was
issued
for
his
arrest.
he
was
convicted
in
the
municipal
court,
fined
a
$100
and
a
suspended
fine.
he
posted
his
bond,
he
appealed
to
the
superior
court
of
washington
which
affirmed,
and
he
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
which
affirmed
in
an
opinion
which
is
cont
--
which
begins
on
page
17
of
the
record.
the
constitutional
issues
before
the
court
were
raised
seasonably
below
and
were
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
the
basic
position
of
the
appellant
in
this
is
case
is
that
frank
v.
maryland
should
be
overruled,
that
a
warrant
should
be
required.
alternatively,
if
frank
v.
maryland
is
not
overruled,
it
is
urged
that
the
court
reverse
this
conviction,
it
reversed
the
decision
below
anyway
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
ordinance
and
because
of
the
failure
to
include
the
requirements
of
probable
cause,
a
requirement
which
was
contained
in
the
ordinance
of
baltimore,
maryland
and
frank
in
the
frank
case
now
which
was
stressed
by
both
justices
frankfurter
and
whittaker
in
their
two
opinions
with
the
majority.
as
far
as
overruling
frank
v.
maryland,
the
basic
position
is
that
there
must
be
some
protection
to
the
citizens
against
the
man
knocking
on
the
door.
there
must
be
some
responsible
way
of
determining
the
validity
of
the
request
for
entry.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no.
mr.
norman
dorsen
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
might
have
been
vacant,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
my
position
would
be
that
the
--
that
if
the
owner
of
the
building
did
not
want
to
admit
entry
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
whether
or
not
it
was
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
it
subsequently
turned
out
to
be
vacant
or
not.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
we're
dealing
here
with
private
property
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
the
earlier
case,
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
consistently
applied
to
protect
a
commercial
premises
as
well
as
dwelling.
and
our
position
is
that
even
in
that
case,
the
man
who
owns
the
premises
is
entitled
to
have
the
authority
seek
a
warrant.
i
would
like
to
read
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
a
distinction
would
have
to
be
made
between
this
case
and
that.
and
i
think
even
in
that
case
mr.
chief
justice
that
part
of
the
premises
which
were
open
to
the
public
could
be
entered
upon
by
inspector.
that
any
part
of
the
premises
that
was
not
open
to
the
public,
for
example
the
prescription
room
of
a
pharmacy
or
the
workshop
of
the
private
office
of
the
owner
of
a
department
store
for
example
that
was
open
to
the
public,
i
would
say
the
same
rule
would
apply
as
the
one
we
are
urging
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
books
are
private
property
and
they're
owned
specifically
by
the
owner
and
i
think
a
warrant
would
be
required
for
books
as
i
think
the
court
has
held
and
do
alleged
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
to
an
--
to
an
open
pasture
field?
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
you
--
you
do
--
push
me
further
than
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
go.
i
would
say
that
--
if
the
--
the
pasture
were
fenced
off,
it
was
kept
as
a
private
preserve
that
it
should
not
be
entered
upon
without
seeking
some
intervention
by
a
magistrate.
i'd
like
to
say
at
this
point
very
squarely
in
view
of
the
discussion
in
the
camara
case
that
the
appellant
and
the
position
we're
taking
here
is
not
attempting
to
subvert
legitimate
inspections
of
any
character.
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
to
accommodate
the
public
interest
in
the
inspection
and
the
interest
of
the
private
citizen
in
his
privacy.
and
this
of
course
is
fully
consistent
with
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
talk
about
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
key
is
that
the
unwilling
door
need
not
be
opened
without
a
showing
to
an
independent
judge
that
a
valid
administrative
need
exists.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i
--
unlike
my
colleague
in
number
92
feel
that
the
key
identifying
phrase
for
my
part
would
be
that
there
must
be
one
a
--
a
reasonable
plan,
a
reasonable
inspection
plan
of
one
sort
or
another
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that
--
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
i
would
say
that
that
was
sufficient.
in
the
dissent
in
eaton
it
was
pointed
out
that
a
regular
rou
--
routinized
spot
check
or
a
check
of
all
the
houses
in
a
particular
neighborhood.
it
presents
to
a
magistrate
would
serve
to
--
to
provide
the
factual
predicate
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
that
if
the
inspector
showed
up
without
a
warrant
the
individual
would
be
entitled
to
say
to
the
inspector
“go
to
the
magistrate
and
present
these
facts
to
the
magistrate.”
and
if
for
example
under
the
facts
you
suggest
mr.
justice
white
the
regulation
say
at
one
year
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
would.
but
supposing
to
take
a
--
a
case
that
is
i
think
cognate
to
the
one
you
suggest
supposing
for
seven
years
they
never
inspected
anyone
else
in
that
neighborhood
but
only
this
man,
i
think
the
magistrate
would
be
entitled
to
ask
some
questions.
even
though
under
a
--
the
factual
statement
you
made
of
--
of
a
regularized
one
year
annual
inspection,
i
would
think
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
if
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
for
example,
the
dissent
in
frank
v.
maryland
which
also
dealt
with
this
problem
suggested
that
experience
may
show
that
there
was
--
there's
a
need
for
periodic
inspection
of
certain
types
of
dwelling
and
specifically
said
that
the
mere
passage
of
time
may
show
that
the
inspection
is
--
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
that
case,
the
warrant
was
issued.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
in
certain
situations.
i
think
that
it
depends
of
course
on
the
path
--
on
the
length
of
time
that
had
passed
and
what
mr.
justice
douglas
did
not
stipulate
precise
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
our
position
and
we
--
we
--
in
urging
it
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
do
not
feel
that
anyway
we're
subverting
the
inspection
process.
and
--
and
the
inspection
would
be
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
quarterly.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
in
the
criminal
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
this
is
--
and
this
mr.
justice
stewart
is
a
different
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
it's
a
kind
of
a
case
where
there's
a
different
showing
the
facts
upon
which
the
warrant
could
issue.
mr.
norman
dorsen
a
different
type
of
probable
cause.
it's
a
different
type
of
probable
cause,
for
example,
in
--
in
the
facts
you
have
to
show
to
search
a
house
from
the
facts
you
have
to
show
the
search
an
automobile,
from
the
facts
that
you
have
to
show
to
search
a
house
in
the
daytime,
and
the
facts
that
you
have
to
show
the
house
--
to
search
a
house
in
the
evening.
and
that
doesn't
cheapen
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
say
so.
if
--
the
way
i
understand
the
--
that
the
earlier
comment
i
made
was
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
my
point
was
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
plan,
a
reasonable
plan
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
i
would
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
call
it
a
--
a
rational
spot
check.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
a
sound
way
of
ensuring
against
fire
hazards
which
is
what
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
inspections
system
is,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
way
go
about
it
and
not
“unreasonable”
under
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
might
say,
in
connection
with
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
in
this
case
in
connection
with
the
dwelling
part
of
the
statute.
there's
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
dwellings,
.040
which
says
on
page
five
of
the
record.
i
think
this
is
very
pertinent
to
your
question.
the
statute
says,
the
ordinance
says,
“the
fire
chief
shall
may
enter,
investigate
and
inspect
any
dwelling
--
any
dwelling
when
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
a
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
title
exists.”
on
page
19
of
the
record,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
interpreted
that
provision
of
the
ordinance
and
said,
“in
noting
the
distinction
between
dwellings
and
commercial
premises
it
will
be
noted
that
.
050
specifically
accepts
the
interiors
of
dwellings
and
consequently,”
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
page
on
the
record
19,
“and
consequently
the
same
may
not
be
inspected
against
the
owner's
will
without
a
warrant.”
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
say
and
nevertheless
word
on
what
the
ordinance
of
seattle
means
is
that
you
can't
have
warrant,
and
presumably
they
had
some
realistic
or
understandable
standards
in
mind
when
they
impose
this
requirement.
and
now
of
course,
this
is
--
it
is
not
our
case
specifically
by
points
up
i
think
--
the
--
the
question
you
--
you
asked
which
is
of
course
a
critical
one
namely
what
exactly
is
going
to
be
shown
to
the
magistrate.
and
that
is
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
--
i
certainly
agree
with
that
but
i
don't
think,
i'm
suggesting
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
that's
all
of
this,
a
rubberstamp.
there
has
to
be
some
rational
plan,
the
man
must
come
forward.
he
must
swear
to
the
facts
contained
in
the
plan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
would
not
be
enough
without
the
warrant.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it
would
be.
i
think
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
--
is
our
position
mr.
justice.
there
has
to
be
the
intervention
of
a
disinterested
independent
judicial
mark
between
the
administrator,
between
the
inspector
and
the
individual.
and
that
as
i
understand
it
was
one
of
prime
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
not
to
leave
the
individual,
not
to
leave
the
individual
citizen
at
the
mercy
of
every
petty
official
and
every
inspector
who
might
want
to
enter.
we
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
abel.
well,
that
of
course
represents
a
--
a
difficult
and
separate
problem.
i
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
without
having
--i
haven't
studied
that
case
very
frankly
in
the
same
way
i
have
this.
my
general
position
would
be
there
must
be
the
intervention
of
a
judicial
or
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
now,
the
--
a
point
that
was
emphasized
by
the
appellees
of
the
camara
nearly
serves
to
--
to
illustrate,
it
seems,
to
me
the
desirability
of
requiring
the
warrant.
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
inspection
programs
that
are
potentially
available
to
infringe
the
privacy
and
infringe
individual
property.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
person
who
has
to
open
the
door,
who
has
to
let
the
man
in
is
in
the
position
of
complete
weakness
and
--
and
without
the
kind
of
protection
that
it
seems
to
me
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
importance
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
of
course
that
again
is
a
serious
problem.
i
would
answer
that
mr.
justice
stewart
by
saying
that
the
law
should
provide
a
way
for
the
individual,
for
the
citizen,
the
property
owner,
to
get
that
determination
before
his
acting
at
his
peril.
before
his
acting
at
his
peril
under
the
criminal
law,
that
was
stressed
in
--
in
the
dissent
in
the
eaton
case
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
this
--
that
--
that
point
is
of
course
raises
it
seems
to
me
the
second
central
issue
here
and
that
is,
that
no
matter
how
one
feels
on
the
question
we're
now
discussing,
the
ordinance
in
this
case
points
of
as
shortly
as
any
that
i
have
seen
the
kind
of
unlimited
at
large
authority
that
some
municipalities
are
prepared
to
attempt
to
invest
their
inspectors
with.
here
is
the
case
where
you
do
not
have
a
requirement
of
reasonable
cause.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
show
me
your
credentials.
there
is
no
requirement
that'd
be
in
the
day
time.
now,
this
of
course
as
we
said
in
the
earlier
case
that
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
decision
below
could
be
reversed
from
that
ground
alone.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
there
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
think
if
i
understand
this
word
means
correctly.
if
i
understand
the
wording
of
the
camara
case
correctly
that
that
is
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
do
feel
you
do
have
a
duty
to
let
the
man
in.
the
impostor
problem
is
not
going
to
be
solved
either
way.
either
way,
the
man
can
come
and
say
he's
an
inspector.
either
way
he
can
come
although
with
more
difficulty
it
seems
to
me
to
try
to
forge
a
warrant.
that
is
not
the
easy
--
easiest
thing
to
do.
but
in
both
cases
--
in
both
cases
under
this
ordinance
and
the
ordinance
in
the
camara
case
you
have
to
let
the
man
in
and
you're
acting
at
your
peril.
i
would
prefer
to
leave
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
if
may
mr.
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
will
--
i
will
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
merely
to
say
that
i
think
the
suggested
solution
to
the
problem
that
appellant
urges
is
a
fair
and
appropriate
accommodation
of
the
important
interest
of
the
private
citizens'
rights
for
security
of
his
private
property
on
the
one
hand
and
the
undoubted
and
legitimate
interest
of
--
of
urban
society,
and
of
course
eve
--
even
suburban
society
to
inspect
and
that
the
purpose
of
urging
the
solution
that
i
have
upon
the
court
is
in
large
part
because
it's
just
as
easy,
just
as
easy
for
the
inspector
to
go
and
get
a
search
warrant
than
arrest
warrant.
and
the
fellow
says,
“you
can't
come
in”
why
put
him
at
his
--
at
his
peril
and
into
wrong
peril
with
the
criminal
law,
send
the
man
to
the
inspector
to
a
disinterested
magistrates,
have
him
present
a
colorable
and
valid
administrative
reason
for
the
entry
and
then
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
municipality
can
be
accommodated.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
if
he
--
he's
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
can
answer
that
fast
very
easily
by
saying
that
some
people
who
are
searching,
some
people
who
are
inspecting,
may
be
doing
it
arbitrarily,
may
be
doing
it
as
part
of
harassment.
secondly,
the
distinction
between
the
ordinance
in
this
case,
the
ordinance
in
--
in
the
see
v.
seattle
as
compared
with
the
ordinances
we
have
had
in
the
other
cases
before
this
cour
--
court
illustrates
the
extent
to
which
municipalities
are
prepared
to
go
and
not
providing
notice.
the
reason
--
the
answer
to
your
question,
it
seems
me,
that
one
way
to
solve
that
problem
is
to
give
a
man
notice
or
make
an
appointment.
the
english
statute
that
was
--
was
cited
in
the
--
in
dissenting
opinions
in
both
eaton
and
price
and
frank
said
that
the
man
should
call
up
and
make
an
appointment.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that's
true.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
as
they
--
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
the
very
english,
the
english
statute
that
was
cited
provides
that
you
have
to
make
an
appointment,
but
if
the
man
still
refuses
then
you
have
to
go
the
independent
judicial
magistrate.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
sure,
actually
the
water
meters
that
i've
seen
sometimes
are
on
the
outside
of
the
house
and
not
in
the
dwelling
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
the
water.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
direct
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
man
knocks
on
the
door
and
says,
“i'm
the
water
inspector.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
i
want
to
see
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
he
presents
his
credentials.
if
the
individual
does
not
want
to
enter,
he
has
to
go
somewhere
and
get
authority
that
you
just
can't
break
into
the
house
over
his
objection.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
breaking
in
any
scheme
or
putting
the
man
in
terrible
criminal
conviction
for
not
admitting
him
which
was
happen
to
mr.
see
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
he
--
the
way
i
--
i
would
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
black,
is
you
would
have
to
say
something
one
step
more.
we
have
also
to
say
that
this
particular
inspection
is
pursuant
to
that
plan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
the
--
the
last
thing
that
he
might
have
to
say
is
what
the
plan
was?
mr.
norman
dorsen
what
--
what
the
plan
of
inspection
was?
i
think
he
--
he
have
to
say,
“we
have
a
plan
for
inspection
fire
for
one
year
inspections
of
this
type
of
dwelling
because
it's
a
wooden
frame
house
and
it's
in
a
neighborhood
where
we
had
--”
mr.
norman
dorsen
no.
we
have
--
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
certain.
i
think
at
--
as
i
said
and
i
--
i
think
at
least,
he
would
have
to
show
that
this
inspection
was
--
was
pursuant
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
to
that
kind.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
had
--
had
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
had
said
yes
and
i
--
and
now
reconsidering
it.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
don't
think
i
would
--
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
that
but
i
do
think
that
the
inspector
would
have
--
i
think
that
the
key
element
is
the
fact
that
the
person
who
wants
to
gain
entry
must
go
to
the
magistrate
and
swear
that
he
is
conducting
the
inspection
pursuant
to
this
plan
and
that
he
--
and
that
he
give
in
--
in
the
warrant
the
--
the
essential
facts
and
i
--
i,
how
far
you'd
--
you'd
go
for
specificity,
how
far
you'd
require
him
to
show
that
for
example
this
plan
was
a
plan
relating
to
a
specific
neighborhood
and
defining
the
neighborhood
and
defining
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
permit
the
search
in
that
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
it
is
not
invalid
but
i
--
but
the
citizen
is
still
entitled
to
the
protection
he
gets
by
having
the
inspector
go
to
the
magistrate
and
affirm
that
the
inspections
taking
place
is
part
of
that
plan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it's
impossible
that
the
inspection
was
not
taking
place
pursuant
to
that
plan
and
the
fact
that
he
is
prepared
to
swear
to
it
and
affirm
that
this
is
part
of
the
plan
for
fire
inspection
of
this
community
or
--
or
a
neighborhood,
is
a
protection
of
the
citizen,
that
the
--
that
the
individual
is
being
kept,
that
the
--
that
the
inspector
is
being
kept
from
the
inside
of
the
premises
without
--
with
what
--
on
the
facts
you've
presented
mr.
justice
black,
seems
to
me
a
reasonable
administrative
plan
for
assuring
that
fires
will
not
take
place.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
it
would
not
under
the
--
under
the
suggestion
i'm
making
and
--
and
the
only
thing
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
was
beyond
scope
of
the
warrant.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
and
i'd
say,
mr.
justice
white
since
i
did
answer
your
question
yes
before
and
now
i
did
rethink
it
and
i
still
would
answer
it
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
ordinance
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
invalid
in
what
--
in
what
that
i
probably
misunderstand
your
question.
i
think
that
the
point
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
guess
my
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
an
essential
part
of
the
validity
in
such
an
ordinance
is
that
upon
the
refusal
of
entry
by
the
individual
that
the
government
has
to
go
to
the
magistrate
to
gain
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
an
essential
part
of
the
validity,
a
prerequisite
to
the
validity
and
the
ordinance
that
you
describe
is
that
even
if
it's
tailored
for
daytime
at
reasonable
times
and
so
forth,
that
if
the
citizen
says
when
the
inspector
comes,
“i
do
not
want
you
to
enter”,
that
at
that
point,
despite
of
the
ordinance
has
worded
you
must
go
and
get.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
that
this
is
part
of
the
plan
of
the
ordinance
as
the
chief
justice
said,
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
companion
case
to
number
92,
camara
which
was
heard
before
the
luncheon
recess.
this
is
the
fire
inspection
case.
it
arises
under
the
fire
code
of
seattle
washington.
the
same
basic
question
is
presented
under
somewhat
different
ordinance
whether
the
constitution
protects
citizens
against
unwarranted
searches.
and
unwarranted
search
is
stated
in
two
senses,
one
without
a
search
warrant
and
two
without
any
reasonable
cause
to
enter.
the
statute
in
issue
is
on
page
5
of
the
record
and
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
the
court.
8.01.050
inspection
of
buildings
and
premises:
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
fire
chief
to
inspect,
and
he
may
enter
all
buildings
and
premises
except
the
interiors
of
dwellings
as
often
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
and
causing
to
be
corrected
any
conditions
liable
to
cause
fire
or
any
violations
to
the
provisions
of
this
title
and
of
any
other
ordinance
concerning
fire
hazards.
there
are
a
couple
of
other
ordinances
and
they're
also
in
the
record
at
the
end
of
the
fire
code.
the
appellant
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
except
dwel
--
dwellings
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
appellant,
mr.
see
was
convicted
under
8.01.140
which
appears
at
page
11
of
the
record.
it
says,
“anyone
violating
or
failing
to
comply
with
any
provision
of
this
title
or
a
lawful
order
of
the
fire
chief
shall
upon
conviction
thereof
be
punishable
by
a
fine
not
to
exceed
$300
or
imprisonment
in
the
city
jail
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
90
days,
or
by
both
such
fine
and
imprisonment,
and
each
day
of
violation
shall
con
--
constitute
a
separate
offense.
in
the
light
of
the
case
you
heard
this
morning
and
the
light
of
frank
v.
maryland
and
eaton
v.
price,
it
is
apparent
that
this
ordinance
is
in
a
sense
the
ultimate
weapon
of
municipalities
because
unlike
the
ordinance
in
frank
v.
maryland,
this
ordinance
does
not
have
any
of
the
finely
tailored
provisions.
it
does
not
have
a
provision
providing
that
the
inspector
must
have
reasonable
cause
to
find
the
nuisance.
it
doesn't
even
provide
that
the
inspection
take
place
at
reasonable
times
and
each
of
the
four
other
ordinances
before
this
court
have
such
a
provision.
the
eaton
ordinance,
the
frank
ordinance,
the
camara
ordinance
and
the
ordinance
in
hadley
v.
city
of
malden
of
massachusetts
which
was
filed
in
january
and
it's
on
the
miscellaneous
docket.
not
only
that,
that
this
ordinance
says
nothing
about
credentials.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
ordinance
which
is
completely
open-ended
as
far
as
the
power
of
inspection
is
concerned.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
stipulated,
they
were
stipulated
from
the
start
and
they
appear
on
pages
1
and
2
of
the
record.
mr.
see,
the
appellant,
is
the
owner
of
a
private
warehouse
in
the
city
of
seattle.
the
fire
department,
to
its
authorized
representative
demanded
the
defendant
that
an
inspection
be
allowed
as
to
the
premises.
the
fire
department
did
not
procure
a
search
warrant
and
it
made
no
claim
that
the
fire
department
had
any
reasonable
cause
to
believe
a
violation
of
the
ordinance
existed
at
the
time
of
the
demand.
the
appellant
refused
to
admit
the
inspection.
eventually
a
warrant
was
issued
for
his
arrest.
he
was
convicted
in
the
municipal
court,
fined
a
$100
and
a
suspended
fine.
he
posted
his
bond,
he
appealed
to
the
superior
court
of
washington
which
affirmed,
and
he
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
which
affirmed
in
an
opinion
which
is
cont
--
which
begins
on
page
17
of
the
record.
the
constitutional
issues
before
the
court
were
raised
seasonably
below
and
were
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
the
basic
position
of
the
appellant
in
this
is
case
is
that
frank
v.
maryland
should
be
overruled,
that
a
warrant
should
be
required.
alternatively,
if
frank
v.
maryland
is
not
overruled,
it
is
urged
that
the
court
reverse
this
conviction,
it
reversed
the
decision
below
anyway
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
ordinance
and
because
of
the
failure
to
include
the
requirements
of
probable
cause,
a
requirement
which
was
contained
in
the
ordinance
of
baltimore,
maryland
and
frank
in
the
frank
case
now
which
was
stressed
by
both
justices
frankfurter
and
whittaker
in
their
two
opinions
with
the
majority.
as
far
as
overruling
frank
v.
maryland,
the
basic
position
is
that
there
must
be
some
protection
to
the
citizens
against
the
man
knocking
on
the
door.
there
must
be
some
responsible
way
of
determining
the
validity
of
the
request
for
entry.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no.
mr.
norman
dorsen
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
might
have
been
vacant,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
my
position
would
be
that
the
--
that
if
the
owner
of
the
building
did
not
want
to
admit
entry
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
whether
or
not
it
was
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
it
subsequently
turned
out
to
be
vacant
or
not.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
we're
dealing
here
with
private
property
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
the
earlier
case,
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
consistently
applied
to
protect
a
commercial
premises
as
well
as
dwelling.
and
our
position
is
that
even
in
that
case,
the
man
who
owns
the
premises
is
entitled
to
have
the
authority
seek
a
warrant.
i
would
like
to
read
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
a
distinction
would
have
to
be
made
between
this
case
and
that.
and
i
think
even
in
that
case
mr.
chief
justice
that
part
of
the
premises
which
were
open
to
the
public
could
be
entered
upon
by
inspector.
that
any
part
of
the
premises
that
was
not
open
to
the
public,
for
example
the
prescription
room
of
a
pharmacy
or
the
workshop
of
the
private
office
of
the
owner
of
a
department
store
for
example
that
was
open
to
the
public,
i
would
say
the
same
rule
would
apply
as
the
one
we
are
urging
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
books
are
private
property
and
they're
owned
specifically
by
the
owner
and
i
think
a
warrant
would
be
required
for
books
as
i
think
the
court
has
held
and
do
alleged
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
to
an
--
to
an
open
pasture
field?
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
you
--
you
do
--
push
me
further
than
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
go.
i
would
say
that
--
if
the
--
the
pasture
were
fenced
off,
it
was
kept
as
a
private
preserve
that
it
should
not
be
entered
upon
without
seeking
some
intervention
by
a
magistrate.
i'd
like
to
say
at
this
point
very
squarely
in
view
of
the
discussion
in
the
camara
case
that
the
appellant
and
the
position
we're
taking
here
is
not
attempting
to
subvert
legitimate
inspections
of
any
character.
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
to
accommodate
the
public
interest
in
the
inspection
and
the
interest
of
the
private
citizen
in
his
privacy.
and
this
of
course
is
fully
consistent
with
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
talk
about
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
key
is
that
the
unwilling
door
need
not
be
opened
without
a
showing
to
an
independent
judge
that
a
valid
administrative
need
exists.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i
--
unlike
my
colleague
in
number
92
feel
that
the
key
identifying
phrase
for
my
part
would
be
that
there
must
be
one
a
--
a
reasonable
plan,
a
reasonable
inspection
plan
of
one
sort
or
another
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that
--
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
i
would
say
that
that
was
sufficient.
in
the
dissent
in
eaton
it
was
pointed
out
that
a
regular
rou
--
routinized
spot
check
or
a
check
of
all
the
houses
in
a
particular
neighborhood.
it
presents
to
a
magistrate
would
serve
to
--
to
provide
the
factual
predicate
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
that
if
the
inspector
showed
up
without
a
warrant
the
individual
would
be
entitled
to
say
to
the
inspector
“go
to
the
magistrate
and
present
these
facts
to
the
magistrate.”
and
if
for
example
under
the
facts
you
suggest
mr.
justice
white
the
regulation
say
at
one
year
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
would.
but
supposing
to
take
a
--
a
case
that
is
i
think
cognate
to
the
one
you
suggest
supposing
for
seven
years
they
never
inspected
anyone
else
in
that
neighborhood
but
only
this
man,
i
think
the
magistrate
would
be
entitled
to
ask
some
questions.
even
though
under
a
--
the
factual
statement
you
made
of
--
of
a
regularized
one
year
annual
inspection,
i
would
think
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
if
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
for
example,
the
dissent
in
frank
v.
maryland
which
also
dealt
with
this
problem
suggested
that
experience
may
show
that
there
was
--
there's
a
need
for
periodic
inspection
of
certain
types
of
dwelling
and
specifically
said
that
the
mere
passage
of
time
may
show
that
the
inspection
is
--
is
valid
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
that
case,
the
warrant
was
issued.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
in
certain
situations.
i
think
that
it
depends
of
course
on
the
path
--
on
the
length
of
time
that
had
passed
and
what
mr.
justice
douglas
did
not
stipulate
precise
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
our
position
and
we
--
we
--
in
urging
it
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
do
not
feel
that
anyway
we're
subverting
the
inspection
process.
and
--
and
the
inspection
would
be
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
quarterly.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
in
the
criminal
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
this
is
--
and
this
mr.
justice
stewart
is
a
different
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
it's
a
kind
of
a
case
where
there's
a
different
showing
the
facts
upon
which
the
warrant
could
issue.
mr.
norman
dorsen
a
different
type
of
probable
cause.
it's
a
different
type
of
probable
cause,
for
example,
in
--
in
the
facts
you
have
to
show
to
search
a
house
from
the
facts
you
have
to
show
the
search
an
automobile,
from
the
facts
that
you
have
to
show
to
search
a
house
in
the
daytime,
and
the
facts
that
you
have
to
show
the
house
--
to
search
a
house
in
the
evening.
and
that
doesn't
cheapen
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
say
so.
if
--
the
way
i
understand
the
--
that
the
earlier
comment
i
made
was
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
my
point
was
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
plan,
a
reasonable
plan
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
i
would
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
call
it
a
--
a
rational
spot
check.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
a
sound
way
of
ensuring
against
fire
hazards
which
is
what
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
inspections
system
is,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
way
go
about
it
and
not
“unreasonable”
under
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
i
might
say,
in
connection
with
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
in
this
case
in
connection
with
the
dwelling
part
of
the
statute.
there's
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
dwellings,
.040
which
says
on
page
five
of
the
record.
i
think
this
is
very
pertinent
to
your
question.
the
statute
says,
the
ordinance
says,
“the
fire
chief
shall
may
enter,
investigate
and
inspect
any
dwelling
--
any
dwelling
when
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
a
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
title
exists.”
on
page
19
of
the
record,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
interpreted
that
provision
of
the
ordinance
and
said,
“in
noting
the
distinction
between
dwellings
and
commercial
premises
it
will
be
noted
that
.
050
specifically
accepts
the
interiors
of
dwellings
and
consequently,”
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
page
on
the
record
19,
“and
consequently
the
same
may
not
be
inspected
against
the
owner's
will
without
a
warrant.”
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
say
and
nevertheless
word
on
what
the
ordinance
of
seattle
means
is
that
you
can't
have
warrant,
and
presumably
they
had
some
realistic
or
understandable
standards
in
mind
when
they
impose
this
requirement.
and
now
of
course,
this
is
--
it
is
not
our
case
specifically
by
points
up
i
think
--
the
--
the
question
you
--
you
asked
which
is
of
course
a
critical
one
namely
what
exactly
is
going
to
be
shown
to
the
magistrate.
and
that
is
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
--
i
certainly
agree
with
that
but
i
don't
think,
i'm
suggesting
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
that's
all
of
this,
a
rubberstamp.
there
has
to
be
some
rational
plan,
the
man
must
come
forward.
he
must
swear
to
the
facts
contained
in
the
plan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
would
not
be
enough
without
the
warrant.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it
would
be.
i
think
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
--
is
our
position
mr.
justice.
there
has
to
be
the
intervention
of
a
disinterested
independent
judicial
mark
between
the
administrator,
between
the
inspector
and
the
individual.
and
that
as
i
understand
it
was
one
of
prime
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
not
to
leave
the
individual,
not
to
leave
the
individual
citizen
at
the
mercy
of
every
petty
official
and
every
inspector
who
might
want
to
enter.
we
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
abel.
well,
that
of
course
represents
a
--
a
difficult
and
separate
problem.
i
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
without
having
--i
haven't
studied
that
case
very
frankly
in
the
same
way
i
have
this.
my
general
position
would
be
there
must
be
the
intervention
of
a
judicial
or
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
now,
the
--
a
point
that
was
emphasized
by
the
appellees
of
the
camara
nearly
serves
to
--
to
illustrate,
it
seems,
to
me
the
desirability
of
requiring
the
warrant.
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
inspection
programs
that
are
potentially
available
to
infringe
the
privacy
and
infringe
individual
property.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
person
who
has
to
open
the
door,
who
has
to
let
the
man
in
is
in
the
position
of
complete
weakness
and
--
and
without
the
kind
of
protection
that
it
seems
to
me
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
importance
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
of
course
that
again
is
a
serious
problem.
i
would
answer
that
mr.
justice
stewart
by
saying
that
the
law
should
provide
a
way
for
the
individual,
for
the
citizen,
the
property
owner,
to
get
that
determination
before
his
acting
at
his
peril.
before
his
acting
at
his
peril
under
the
criminal
law,
that
was
stressed
in
--
in
the
dissent
in
the
eaton
case
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
this
--
that
--
that
point
is
of
course
raises
it
seems
to
me
the
second
central
issue
here
and
that
is,
that
no
matter
how
one
feels
on
the
question
we're
now
discussing,
the
ordinance
in
this
case
points
of
as
shortly
as
any
that
i
have
seen
the
kind
of
unlimited
at
large
authority
that
some
municipalities
are
prepared
to
attempt
to
invest
their
inspectors
with.
here
is
the
case
where
you
do
not
have
a
requirement
of
reasonable
cause.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
show
me
your
credentials.
there
is
no
requirement
that'd
be
in
the
day
time.
now,
this
of
course
as
we
said
in
the
earlier
case
that
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
decision
below
could
be
reversed
from
that
ground
alone.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
there
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
think
if
i
understand
this
word
means
correctly.
if
i
understand
the
wording
of
the
camara
case
correctly
that
that
is
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
do
feel
you
do
have
a
duty
to
let
the
man
in.
the
impostor
problem
is
not
going
to
be
solved
either
way.
either
way,
the
man
can
come
and
say
he's
an
inspector.
either
way
he
can
come
although
with
more
difficulty
it
seems
to
me
to
try
to
forge
a
warrant.
that
is
not
the
easy
--
easiest
thing
to
do.
but
in
both
cases
--
in
both
cases
under
this
ordinance
and
the
ordinance
in
the
camara
case
you
have
to
let
the
man
in
and
you're
acting
at
your
peril.
i
would
prefer
to
leave
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
if
may
mr.
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
will
--
i
will
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
merely
to
say
that
i
think
the
suggested
solution
to
the
problem
that
appellant
urges
is
a
fair
and
appropriate
accommodation
of
the
important
interest
of
the
private
citizens'
rights
for
security
of
his
private
property
on
the
one
hand
and
the
undoubted
and
legitimate
interest
of
--
of
urban
society,
and
of
course
eve
--
even
suburban
society
to
inspect
and
that
the
purpose
of
urging
the
solution
that
i
have
upon
the
court
is
in
large
part
because
it's
just
as
easy,
just
as
easy
for
the
inspector
to
go
and
get
a
search
warrant
than
arrest
warrant.
and
the
fellow
says,
“you
can't
come
in”
why
put
him
at
his
--
at
his
peril
and
into
wrong
peril
with
the
criminal
law,
send
the
man
to
the
inspector
to
a
disinterested
magistrates,
have
him
present
a
colorable
and
valid
administrative
reason
for
the
entry
and
then
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
municipality
can
be
accommodated.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
if
he
--
he's
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
can
answer
that
fast
very
easily
by
saying
that
some
people
who
are
searching,
some
people
who
are
inspecting,
may
be
doing
it
arbitrarily,
may
be
doing
it
as
part
of
harassment.
secondly,
the
distinction
between
the
ordinance
in
this
case,
the
ordinance
in
--
in
the
see
v.
seattle
as
compared
with
the
ordinances
we
have
had
in
the
other
cases
before
this
cour
--
court
illustrates
the
extent
to
which
municipalities
are
prepared
to
go
and
not
providing
notice.
the
reason
--
the
answer
to
your
question,
it
seems
me,
that
one
way
to
solve
that
problem
is
to
give
a
man
notice
or
make
an
appointment.
the
english
statute
that
was
--
was
cited
in
the
--
in
dissenting
opinions
in
both
eaton
and
price
and
frank
said
that
the
man
should
call
up
and
make
an
appointment.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that's
true.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
as
they
--
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
the
very
english,
the
english
statute
that
was
cited
provides
that
you
have
to
make
an
appointment,
but
if
the
man
still
refuses
then
you
have
to
go
the
independent
judicial
magistrate.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
sure,
actually
the
water
meters
that
i've
seen
sometimes
are
on
the
outside
of
the
house
and
not
in
the
dwelling
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
the
water.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
direct
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
man
knocks
on
the
door
and
says,
“i'm
the
water
inspector.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
i
want
to
see
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
he
presents
his
credentials.
if
the
individual
does
not
want
to
enter,
he
has
to
go
somewhere
and
get
authority
that
you
just
can't
break
into
the
house
over
his
objection.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
breaking
in
any
scheme
or
putting
the
man
in
terrible
criminal
conviction
for
not
admitting
him
which
was
happen
to
mr.
see
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
he
--
the
way
i
--
i
would
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
black,
is
you
would
have
to
say
something
one
step
more.
we
have
also
to
say
that
this
particular
inspection
is
pursuant
to
that
plan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
the
--
the
last
thing
that
he
might
have
to
say
is
what
the
plan
was?
mr.
norman
dorsen
what
--
what
the
plan
of
inspection
was?
i
think
he
--
he
have
to
say,
“we
have
a
plan
for
inspection
fire
for
one
year
inspections
of
this
type
of
dwelling
because
it's
a
wooden
frame
house
and
it's
in
a
neighborhood
where
we
had
--”
mr.
norman
dorsen
no.
we
have
--
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
certain.
i
think
at
--
as
i
said
and
i
--
i
think
at
least,
he
would
have
to
show
that
this
inspection
was
--
was
pursuant
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
to
that
kind.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
had
--
had
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
had
said
yes
and
i
--
and
now
reconsidering
it.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
don't
think
i
would
--
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
that
but
i
do
think
that
the
inspector
would
have
--
i
think
that
the
key
element
is
the
fact
that
the
person
who
wants
to
gain
entry
must
go
to
the
magistrate
and
swear
that
he
is
conducting
the
inspection
pursuant
to
this
plan
and
that
he
--
and
that
he
give
in
--
in
the
warrant
the
--
the
essential
facts
and
i
--
i,
how
far
you'd
--
you'd
go
for
specificity,
how
far
you'd
require
him
to
show
that
for
example
this
plan
was
a
plan
relating
to
a
specific
neighborhood
and
defining
the
neighborhood
and
defining
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
permit
the
search
in
that
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
it
is
not
invalid
but
i
--
but
the
citizen
is
still
entitled
to
the
protection
he
gets
by
having
the
inspector
go
to
the
magistrate
and
affirm
that
the
inspections
taking
place
is
part
of
that
plan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it's
impossible
that
the
inspection
was
not
taking
place
pursuant
to
that
plan
and
the
fact
that
he
is
prepared
to
swear
to
it
and
affirm
that
this
is
part
of
the
plan
for
fire
inspection
of
this
community
or
--
or
a
neighborhood,
is
a
protection
of
the
citizen,
that
the
--
that
the
individual
is
being
kept,
that
the
--
that
the
inspector
is
being
kept
from
the
inside
of
the
premises
without
--
with
what
--
on
the
facts
you've
presented
mr.
justice
black,
seems
to
me
a
reasonable
administrative
plan
for
assuring
that
fires
will
not
take
place.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
it
would
not
under
the
--
under
the
suggestion
i'm
making
and
--
and
the
only
thing
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
was
beyond
scope
of
the
warrant.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
and
i'd
say,
mr.
justice
white
since
i
did
answer
your
question
yes
before
and
now
i
did
rethink
it
and
i
still
would
answer
it
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
ordinance
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
--
invalid
in
what
--
in
what
that
i
probably
misunderstand
your
question.
i
think
that
the
point
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
guess
my
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
an
essential
part
of
the
validity
in
such
an
ordinance
is
that
upon
the
refusal
of
entry
by
the
individual
that
the
government
has
to
go
to
the
magistrate
to
gain
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
an
essential
part
of
the
validity,
a
prerequisite
to
the
validity
and
the
ordinance
that
you
describe
is
that
even
if
it's
tailored
for
daytime
at
reasonable
times
and
so
forth,
that
if
the
citizen
says
when
the
inspector
comes,
“i
do
not
want
you
to
enter”,
that
at
that
point,
despite
of
the
ordinance
has
worded
you
must
go
and
get.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
and
that
this
is
part
of
the
plan
of
the
ordinance
as
the
chief
justice
said,
yes.
