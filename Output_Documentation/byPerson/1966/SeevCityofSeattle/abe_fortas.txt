was
there
anything
in
this
building
as
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
for
all
we
know
it
might
have
been
a
vacant
building?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
your
position
apply
to
that
even
if
it
is
vacant?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
even
if
it
were
a
vacant
building?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
solely
because
of
the
factor
of
ownership
though.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
this
were
an
open
field
and
you
have
an
inspection
statute,
does
the
--
does
the
fourth
amendment
apply
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
pasture
not
even
a
cow?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he'd
got
a
lot
of
paper,
pay
a
lot
--
lot
of
his
personal
papers
that
are
lying
around
near
an
open
fire?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
if
he
says,
“you
leave
me
alone.
they're
my
personal
papers,”
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
point
is
as
i
understand
it
that
the
evidence
observed
by
the
fire
chief
or
his
agent
after
entering
the
--
the
premises
and
would
be
used
against
the
man
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
say
the
fireman,
the
inspector
would
come
inside
and
testify
that
he
made
an
inspection
on
the
premises
and
that
in
the
course
to
that
inspection
and
he
saw
the
--
this
condition
which
was
in
violation
of
the
code
and
then
was
notified
to
be
corrected
and
he
didn't
correct
it.
that's
one
reason
why
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
with
your
--
what
i
understand
to
be
your
distinction.
justice
abe
fortas
--
between
inspections
and
a
criminal
investigation
and
you
take
it
the
other
way
around.
let's
suppose
that
the
police
go
to
mrs.
smith
and
say,
“i
want
to
go
through
your
house
because
we
think
johnny
has
been
stealing.”
she
says,
“no
or
you
can't
enter
in
my
house.”
and
they
say,
“well
--
well
we
won't
prosecute
you.”
and
so
they
give
her
some
--
some
kind
of
immunity
and
they
don't
in
fact
prosecute
her
that
they
go
through
the
house
and
obtained
some
evidence
which
they
subsequently
used
against
johnny,
her
son.
and
suppose
there's
no
doubt
in
your
mind
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
she
did
not
consent
them.
they
just
said
they're
not
going
to
use
it
against
her.
justice
abe
fortas
now
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
your
analysis
as
i
understand
that
requires
us
to
face
up
with
that,
perhaps
i
don't
follow
you
precisely
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
i
do,
it
does
require,
in
effect,
to
face
up
to
this
problem.

your
position
is
contrary

the
dicta

i

followed
you.

your
position
