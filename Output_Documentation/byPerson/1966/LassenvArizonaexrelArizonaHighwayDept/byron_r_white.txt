justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
the
same
--
by
the
same
token
i
suppose
then
the
state
could
give
100
acres
of
land
to
ibm
to
build
a
plant
because
once
the
ibm
plant
is
there,
the
surrounding
property
will
be
three
times
as
valuable
and
there
will
be
a
great
--
sort
of
a
nucleus
where
an
industrial
development
in
the
(inaudible)
expert
real
estate
testimony
that
supported
those
values
i
suppose
it
would
take
the
same
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
go
to
line
between
--
between
increments
attached
to
a
disposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
increment
that
arises
from
the
state's
own
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
the
state
could
take
the
property,
500
acres
of
it
for
a
golf
course
because
the
surrounding
property
would
be
contend
as
valuable?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way
mr.
weisl,
in
terms
of
paying
cash,
when
does
the
federal
highway
interstate
highway
for
example,
who
has
to
pay
for
the
exhibition
of
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
weisl,
what
do
you
do
about
ervien?
it
seems
to
me
that
presented
the
enhancement
argument
of
the
court
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
seems
to
me
that
court
almost
squarely
rejected
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
saying
--
as
they
were
saying
they
will
back
--
they
will
get
back
a
little
more
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
we
talking
about
out
there
in
arizona,
about
40,000
acres?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
mean
the
number
of
acres
that
have
been
taken
for
roads
up
to
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
only
way
of
saying
they
are
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
lee
how
about
if
the
state
takes
1000
acres
of
the
land
and
because
we're
going
to
use
this
as
a
park
and
the
wide
built
camp
ground
and
things
like
that,
it's
not
available
for
anything
else.
but
i'll
guarantee
if
that
were
put
up
for
auction
and
they
got
some
bidders.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
you
say
that
that
--
is
that
subject
to
the
sale
or
an
auction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
this
even
a
sale
or
disposition.
why
don't
you
talk
just
stop
there
and
say
this
is
--
the
act
has
no
application
to
non-dispositional
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
sale,
no
lease,
no
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
rely.
you
wouldn't
need
to
rely
on
the
sale
provision
to
protect
the
value
of
the
trust.
you
just
rely
on
general
trust
principle.
no
trustee
can
use
the
land
do
depreciate
its
value
or
use
it
for
a
purpose
not
contemplated
by
the
donor.
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
state
took
some
of
this
land
and
permitted
to
a
use
depreciated
the
whole
value
of
the
trust
the
state
would
be
in
real
trouble
as
a
trustee?
you
wouldn't
have
to
rely
on
the
state
on
these
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
find
that
in
the
act.
that's
just
general
trust,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
state
has
to
pay
for
it,
we'll
say,
who
is
going
to
pick
up
the
tab
eventually
if
the
state
have
to
pay
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
rights
of
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
you're
wrong
and
that
they
can't
take
these
for
nothing,
they
have
to
pay
some
money,
who's
going
to
pay
eventually,
the
state
or
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frank,
could
i
ask
you
just
about
one
situation?
suppose
the
state
lets
one
of
these
sections
that
on
the
edge
of
the
city
and
they
think
they
ought
to
just
subdivide
these
sections
and
sell
it
off
and
so
it
does
that
while
it
(inaudible)
county
and
it
dedicates
to
roads
and
streets
all
over
the
section,
so
that
roads,
(inaudible)
utility,
they
spend
a
good
deal
of
trust
money
--
trust
money
on
this
section.
and
then
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
comes
in
and
says
you
can't
do
this
because
of
the
--
or
the
school
people
say
you
can't
do
this
because
there's
going
to
be
several
of
these
acres
here
that
are
going
to
be
street
and
you
are
going
to
pay
for
it.
you
got
to
pay
for
it.
would
you,
i
suppose
you
take
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
just
one
section
deal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
we're
dealing
is
trying
to
get
the
section
in
condition
itself.
they
are
putting
in
the
utilities
and
the
roads
and
then
they
begin
to
sell
it
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i
said
suppose
they
extend
the
trust
money
in
improving
trust
lands
so
they
will
bring
in
higher
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
developers
do
subdivide
it
rather
than
selling
it.subdivide
it,
got
a
lot
of
money
on
it,
and
then
they
sell
it.
and
they
make
a
pretty
good
profit.
how
about
--
how
about
the
trust
doing
it,
developing
its
land,
selling
it
and
making
enhancing
profit
to
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
--
you
would
say
that
the
moment
they
purported
to
designate
some
of
these
lands
permanently
for
use
of
streets,
they
--
the
state
hold
some
money
in
the
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
much
any
difference
then
but
the
fact
is
you
would
say
they
have
to
pay
for
those
roads.
justice
