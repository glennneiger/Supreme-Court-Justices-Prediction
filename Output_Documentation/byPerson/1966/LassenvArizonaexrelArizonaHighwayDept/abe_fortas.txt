justice
abe
fortas
mr.
frank
(voice
overlap).
suppose
we
reversed
on
your
theory.
what
happens
with
respect
to
the
land
that's
been
transferred
in
violation
of
the
trust?
i
notice
your
consultation
says
that
transfers
in
violation
of
the
press
have
been
null
and
void.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
a
matter
of
theory
or
principle
in
your
opinion
does
that
mean
that
title
to
those
lands
transferred
in
violation
of
the
enabling
act
in
the
constitution
in
regards
forthwith
to
the
trust
fund
or
does
it
mean
that
it's
voidable
in
the
sense
that
state
action
has
to
be
brought.
justice
abe
fortas
nothing
like
this
is
the
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
before
us
anyway,
is
it?
that's
the
only
question
for
that
aspect.
i
noticed
the
statement
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
that
i
would
think
that
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
there
is
merit
to
the
absolute
position
that
is
to
say
that
because
of
a
fugitive
substitute
value
that's
created
that
the
trust
fund
is
not
entitled
in
any
compensation
whatever
whether
you
take
into
account
or
don't
take
into
account,
the
(inaudible)
values
not
before
us
now.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
apply
that
principle
to
private
taking
of
a
private
property?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
you
agree
that
whatever
the
principles
are
in
the
field
of
eminent
domain
with
respect
to
private
property
that
those
are
the
principles
that
have
to
be
applied
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
do
you
do
that?
why
do
you
go
further
up
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
certain.
i
am
uncertain
and
--
but
that
is
---
is
that
your
conception
of
what
this
trust
is?
or
isn't
it
a
trust
of
a
construed
on
the
basis
of
ordinary
principles
of
law
which
parcels
of
property
were
place
and
those
parcels
are
taken
out
and
parcel
by
parcel
that
has
to
be
taken
out,
they've
got
to
be
subjected
the
value
of
judgments?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
utility
company
condemns
a
track
of
land
in
an
enormous
ranch
for
a
utility
or
right
of
way
for
its
supposed
(inaudible)
and
i
suppose
that
almost
every
time
that
brings
a
good
deal
of
benefit
to
--
on
the
land
and
the
offset
is
are
you
telling
me
that
you
offset
the
benefits
to
a
land
that
is
not
taken?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
was
hopefully
could
make
that
into
--
find
it
unnecessary
to
pass
on
these
questions
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
not
still
inclined
to
believe
that
we
can
because
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
highway
department's
position
to
prevail
when
we
have
to
indulge
in
assumption
that
there's
a
complete
offset
because
if
there
is
any
discrepancy
to
the
value
of
the
land
taken
in
the
incremental
value
as
a
result
of
building
a
highway
then
their
case
falls,
it
seems
to
me,
we
don't
have
to
go
any
further.
justice
abe
fortas
if
that
is
so
why
(inaudible)
anything
for
--
when
it
takes
for
a
highway?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
all
the
procedures
and
standards
of
the
act
don't
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
taking?
justice
abe
fortas
and
apply
only
to
a
private
taking?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
your
position
that
if
you
can
--
is
your
position
the
same
as
mr.
frank's
in
this
respect
or
is
it
different?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
does
he
agree
of
the
procedure
of
the
standards
of
the
act
do
not
apply
to
a
taking
for
a
governmental
purpose?
is
that
what
you're
telling
us
now
as
i
understand
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
will
have
--
you
rely
on
anything
in
the
act,
well
the
act
does
say
that
for
purposes
of
the
u.s.irrigation
projects
some
of
these
lands
can
be
turned
on
to
the
united
states,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
congress
didn't
say
anything
about
the
state
thing
that
would
have
taken
without
paying
money.
is
there
anything
in
this
enabling
act
that
supports
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
relying
on
something
that's
not
in
the
act
instead
and
you're
saying
that
if
congress
intended
to
cover
it
they
would
cover
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
are
starting
off
with
the
agreement
that
the
state
highway
department
has
applied?
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
the
standard
come
from?
i
thought
the
standard
of
eminent
domain
was
one
of
value.
the
value
doesn't
mean
just
equating
everything
that
you
have
a
whole
pot
work
the
same
that
it
was
before.
the
question
is
have
paid
value
for
what
you
have
expected
from
that,
isn't
that
right,
isn't
that
conventional?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
aware
of
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
that
rule
apply
here,
would
the
arizona
eminent
domain
apply
here?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
in
effect
in
new
mexico?
justice
abe
fortas
but
how
do
you
do
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
fact
that
the
enabling
act
does
contain
two
specific
provisions
about
public
use.
one
is
use
by
the
united
states
for
irrigation.
the
other
is
a
provision
that
is
a
provision
that
says
that
if
the
state
of
arizona
wants
to
exchange
any
lands
in
trust
for
any
other
lands,
they've
got
to
go
to
congress
and
get
approval.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
why.
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
clearly
noble
(inaudible)
statutory
construction,
isn't
it
that
is
to
say
would
you
ordinarily
say
that
to
the
extent
that
congress
did
not
specifically
cover
state
use
meant
for
the
generality
of
the
statute
to
the
government.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lee
in
the
federal
highway
program,
i
suppose
a
lot
of
these
lands
are
used
in
that?
justice
abe
fortas
the
value
of
the
land
i
think
somebody
said
that
the
value
of
the
land
is
counted
as
part
of
the
state
contribution.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
whether
the
state
of
arizona
puts
a
value
on
these
trust
lands
for
purposes
of
the
federal
highway
program?
in
other
words,
if
it
uses
some
trust
lands
as
part
of
its
contribution
to
the
federal
highway
program
i
presume
that
it
puts
a
value
and
it
places
some
value
on
them.
you
know
whether
it
does
or
not.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
not
done.
then
this
goes
in
as
free?
goes
in
for
free?
justice
abe
fortas

maybe
you
don't
know.
justice

that
