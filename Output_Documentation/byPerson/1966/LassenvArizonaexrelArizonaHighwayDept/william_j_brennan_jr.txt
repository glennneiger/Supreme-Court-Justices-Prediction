what
is
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
theory
is
that
since
you
do
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
you
play
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
reason
for
the
government
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder
mr.
weisl,
i
take
it
it's
not
because
the
highway
went
through
anything
else
but
these
school
lands
which
perhaps
are
worth
--
arizona
got
them
at
25
cents
an
acre
and
now
worth
$5
an
acre,
you
wouldn't
say
the
state
can
give
away
$100,000.00
worth
because
of
what's
left
is
still
worth
a
lot
more
than
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
--
the
highways
conceded
here
have
a
limited
access
highway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
some
of
them
go
some
50
miles
before
it
gets
to
an
exit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
wonder
how
much
good
does
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
50
is
too
many?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
court
below
was
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
90%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
90%
by
the
federal
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
would
those
private
lands
would
have
to
--
would
the
--
if
you
went
through
one
of
these
sections
which
are
privately
owned
i
take
it
you
have
to
pay
for
it.
