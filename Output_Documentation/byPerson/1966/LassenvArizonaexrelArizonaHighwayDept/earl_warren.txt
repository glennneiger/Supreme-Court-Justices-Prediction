you
may
continue
your

chief

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisl,
i
was
wondering
about
another
situation
now
that
question
temporary
when
the
railroads
came
through
they
were
given
land
grants
of
every
order
of
the
section
for
20
miles
on
each
side
of
the
right
of
way.
how
was
that
plan
treated
in
arizona
western
states
when
it
comes
to
condemning
for
a
highway?
are
they
subject
to
the
limitation
on
eminent
domain
that
you
put
on
in
this
case
or
are
they
treated
differently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
less
liberal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
rule
would
be
applied
to
those
land
grants
that
were
granted
for
the
sole
purpose
of
developing
the
country?
what
rule
do
they
apply
if
it's
stricter
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisl,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
if
we
adopt
your
theory
of
the
case
must
that
be
the
rule
in
all
the
western
states
or
would
the
parties
be
left
to
the
condemnation
procedures
in
the
various
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
other
words,
would
they
have
to
treat
this
trust
fund
the
same
as
they
would
any
other
property
that
they
take
from
the
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this
question
mr.
lee.
you
have
a
sort
of
a
checkerboard
effect
over
here.
one
section
over
here
and
another
one
down
a
few
miles
and
another
one
over
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
you
are
--
when
you
are
determining
what
the
value
of
this
property
is
and
what
it
might
gain
or
lose
by
reason
of
a
highway.
do
you
asses
the
value
that
will
come
to
that
land
as
being
the
value
that
will
come
to
that
particular
parcel
through
which
the
highway
goes
or
do
you
consider
it
the
value
that
is
affected
in
all
the
checkerboard
affair
over
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
partly
answers
the
question
i
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
the
checkerboard
here.
let's
say
you
have
section
1
and
section
16
and
section
62,
32
in
the
school
lands,
you
go
through
just
a
portion
of
section
1.
now
when
you
are
determining
the
value
of
the
highway
to
the
school
lands
and
when
you
are
considering
the
damage
to
the
school
lands,
do
you
consider
it
with
relation
to
only
section
1
through
which
the
highway
cost
or
do
you
consider
the
added
value
or
depreciated
value
as
to
section
16,
section
32
and
all
the
other
school
lands.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that
if
it
was
a
private
utility
or
a
private
individual?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
would
you
rely
to
the
show
that
congress
could
not
have
anticipated
the
need
for
public
roads
in
this
great
western
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
1910
after
the
automobile
that
came
along
and
was
really
developed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
they
anticipate
reclamation
projects
and
not
be
able
to
recognize
the
possibility
of
roads?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
federal
government
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
who
gets
the
whole
benefit
if
the
other
side
prevails?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
public
schools
of
arizona.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
wouldn't
that
pay
more
of
a
benefit
to
the
state
than
when
you
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
take
them
all
into
consideration.
that
way
you
take
this
parcel
over
here
and
add
the
benefit
it
gets
to
all
these
other
parcels
of
the
fund
which
you
don't
do
that
with
other
people.
chief
justice
