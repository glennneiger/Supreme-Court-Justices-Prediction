mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
this
court.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
as
an
amicus
curiae
arises
because
of
the
federal
government's
interest
in
these
trust
lands
as
grantor
of
the
trust
lands
because
of
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
attorney
general
by
section
28
of
the
arizona,
new
mexico's
enabling
acts
and
because
of
course
of
the
federal
government's
growing
interest
in
the
field
of
education
and
its
financing.
before
i
embark
upon
the
details
of
its
position,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
as
of
the
counsel
for
the
state
land
department
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
is,
what
is
the
real
question
before
this
court?
is
it
simply
in
the
absolute
sense,
must
compensation
be
paid
by
the
state
when
it
takes
school
lands
for
public
purposes?
if
that
were
the
naked
question
before
this
court,
i
think
all
parties
would
say
that
perhaps
it
has
already
been
answered
by
agreement
for
even
the
state
highway
department
now
refers
in
its
brief
that
value
must
be
paid
for
these
school
trust
lands.
however,
they
say
that
the
value
is
paid
by
the
inherent
enhancement
that
arises
when
a
highway
is
built.
of
course,
in
a
real
sense
that
position
is
that
value
need
not
be
paid
because
if
you
can
conclusively
and
irrebuttably
presume
compensation
as
the
highway
enhancement
rather
as
the
highway
department
urges
you
will
foreclose
any
inquiry
as
to
what
really
happens
to
the
value
of
the
trust
when
the
lands
are
taken.
united
states
decision
in
this
case
is
that
you
must
look
at
the
trust
lands
as
a
whole
in
a
given
state.
they
are
there
to
produce
income
to
support
and
maintain
the
public
schools
of
that
state.
the
question
is
when
a
trust
land
is
taken
for
a
public
purpose
such
as
a
highway,
is
the
earning
power
of
that
trust
impaired?
is
it
no
longer
as
valuable
after
the
taking
as
it
was
before?
if
that
is
so,
and
the
trust
is
breached
and
what
the
state
has
done
is
wrong.
can
you
consider
the
question
of
enhancement
of
other
lands
when
you
take
a
parcel,
a
school
section
to
build
a
highway
and
i
think
you
can.
let
us
say
for
example
that
the
entire
value
of
the
lands
--
school
lands
in
the
state
is
$10
million
and
you
take
one
section
you
build
one
road
on
it.
clearly,
that
section
no
longer
has
a
value
in
itself
because
the
road
is
so
large
that
no
one
would
lease
it,
no
income
can
be
earned
from
that
school
section.
but
if
this
highway,
his
access
to
a
whole
new
portion
of
the
state
so
that
the
lands
there
can
now
leased
at
high
rental,
can
be
sold
for
high
prices
then
of
course
it
is
fair
to
state
that
the
trust
is
preserved
even
though
compensation
is
not
paid
by
the
state
for
the
particular
parcel.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
equally
reasonable
to
state
that
in
certain
cases,
a
taking
for
a
highway
will
result
in
no
enhancement
of
the
remainder
of
the
trust
and
the
total
value
the
trust
enhance
its
earning
power
will
be
diminished.
a
simple
example,
an
access
road
is
needed
to
make
it
easier
to
get
to
the
state
prison.
i
could
not
see
that
this
would
increase
the
pecuniary
value
of
other
school
lands
within
a
state
so
that
you
can
say
enhancement
can
be
presumed.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
doctrine
of
benefits
mr.
justice
fortas
is
applied
in
many
instances
in
eminent
domain
proceedings.
the
requirement
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
benefits
must
be
special
and
palpable
and
capable
of
ascertainment
not
merely
speculative.
that
is
you
can
say
it
is
more
than
you
can
say
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
is
nice
to
have
a
road
here.
you
have
to
say
that
there
is
a
road
here
now
and
the
remainder
of
this
man's
property
is
benefited
because
he
has
now
access
to
the
biggest
city
in
the
state,
he
now
can
develop
it
for
a
residential
purposes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
we
go
a
little
bit
further
because
in
eminent
domain
proceeding,
generally,
the
remaining
property
benefit
that
has
to
be
closer
physically
and
in
relation
in
terms
of
use
to
the
property
actually
taken.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
because
the
purpose
mr.
justice
is
to
preserve
a
trust
of
a
certain
value
so
that
it
can
earn
a
certain
amount
of
income
to
provide
for
public
school.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
we
agree
on
the
latter
part
of
your
statement
that
value
judgments
have
to
be
made.
the
reason
that
i
feel
you
can
go
a
little
further
than
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
is
that
the
state
highway
department
for
example
is
taking
a
road
for
a
public
purpose
to
require
to
pay
an
amount
of
money
that
will
make
the
trust
greater
afterwards
than
before
is
placing
an
undue
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
that
is
the
rule
in
condemnation
and
i
--
it
was
first
enunciated
by
this
court
as
early
as
1897,
in
the
case
called,
not
cited
in
our
briefs
bowman
against
ross.
the
requirement
is
that
the
benefits
have
to
be
readily
capable
of
ascertainment
than
measurable
so
that
an
expert
witness
and
remember
that
these
are
tested
in
adversary
forum
with
expert
testimony
on
it.
an
expert
witness
can
say
in
fact
your
property,
your
remaining
property
is
more
valuable,
you
can
sell
it
for
more.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
agree
completely.
we
simply
say
that
a
factual
determination
must
be
made
as
to
the
actual
effect
of
the
taking.
whether
which
is
one
that
is
capable
of
being
made
because
expert
testimony
would
be
available
to
inform
the
body
making
the
decision,
be
it
the
court
or
an
administrative
agency
as
to
whether
the
remainder
of
the
trust
is
enhanced
in
value
or
whether
it
is
not
enhanced
in
value.
the
minute
that
is
not
enhanced
in
value
of
course,
the
compensation
in
the
form
of
cash
must
be
paid
by
the
state
authority.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
they
are
treated
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
although
i
can't
say
this
with
great
confidence.
i
believe
they
are
treated
with
greater
strictness
that
is
our
rule
that
we
urge
here
is
somewhat
more
liberal
to
the
taking
authority
than
the
rule
in
respect
to
these
railroad
land
grants.
they
are
treated
like
private
persons
we
say
this
trust
may
be
treated
a
little
more
--
little
less
liberally.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
say
a
more
liberal
rule
of
benefits
can
be
applied
in
these
trust
lands
when
a
state,
another
state
agency
is
taking
them
that
is
if
you
look
through
the
benefits
of
the
trust
as
a
whole
rather
than
to
immediately
adjacent
parcel
of
property.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
they
apply
these
exact
same
rules
i
believe
to
other
lands
that
are
in
normal,
private
ownerships.
that
is
to
say
you
can
offset
benefits
against
compensation
due
provided
that
it
is
adjacently
in
the
same
use
and
what
have
you
but
you
can't
say
that
that
the
benefit
to
a
section,
thousand
miles
away
would
be
recognized
into
the
offset.
it
has
to
be
much
more
closed.
i
want
to
say
however
that
our
position
does
not
foreclose
a
state
paying
compensation
measured
by
the
rule
asserted
by
the
state
land
commissioner
petitioner
here.
we
are
saying
that
as
a
minimum,
we
think
the
requirements
maintained
by
the
trust
would
be
met
by
the
recognition
of
benefits
on
some
cases
when
they
are
actually
capable
of
ascertainment
and
measurement.
as
to
the
contentions
made
by
petitioner
that
the
recognitions
of
these
benefits
are
foreclosed
by
the
enabling
act,
i
think
what
congress
was
speaking
of
was
in
terms
of
actual
disposition
to
private
parties
which
is
a
quite
different
matter
than
changes
of
ownerships
through
eminent
domain
proceeding
the
latter
having
inherent
safeguards
of
judicial
review
of
an
initial
determination
at
least
in
arizona
by
an
administrative
agency
whereas
a
provision
relating
to
an
absolute
outright
sale
by
a
state
through
a
private
party
is
an
area
where
review
is
not
inherent
and
not
necessary.
in
fact
the
very
thing
complained
of
in
the
tall
timber
cases,
eminent
domain
where
both
parties
are
presumably
interested
in
the
public
good
and
the
public
benefit
is
quite
different.
i
think
the
enabling
act
permits
the
interpretation
that
we
quite
submit
of
that
is
benefits
to
the
remaining
land
can
be
recognized
and
compensation
in
some
cases
need
not
be
paid
in
form
of
cash
because
it
has
actually
resulted
in
terms
of
enhanced
value
to
the
remainder.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
i
wouldn't
really
because
the
enabling
act
speaks
as
to
actual
voluntary
i
think
dispositions
by
the
state.
that
is
to
say,
these
are
truly
prohibited
by
the
enabling
act
whereas
eminent
domain
is
not
specifically
dealt
with
in
these
enabling
acts
and
i
think
it
was
probably
overlooked
by
the
congress.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
some
of
the
acts
for
example
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
if
it
is
for
a
recognized
public
purpose
for
which
the
state
has
the
condemnation
power,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
correct
whereas
the
enabling
act
specifically
require
a
minimum
most
of
them
do
anyway,
require
minimum
payments
for
disposition
to
private
persons.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
because
of
the
i
think
clear
congressional
purpose
to
create
a
trust
for
schools
to
preserve
the
value
of
that
trust
so
that
the
intent
of
congress
which
was
to
have
a
trust
for
schools
be
continued.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
requirement
for
preservation
of
a
trust
through
some
form
of
compensation
remains
in
eminent
domain
the
compensation
on
occasion
can
be
in
the
form
of
benefits
to
the
remainder
which
are
so
great
as
to
outweigh
the
amount
of
cash
loss
to
the
particular
track
of
land.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
we
agree
that
the
compensation
must
be
paid.
we
are
in
slight
disagreement
in
that
he
says
that
you
cannot
offset
general
benefits
to
the
remainder
of
the
trust.
you
have
to
actually
pay
cash
to
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
you
would
then
--
you
would
take
a
far
harsher
view,
we
would
say
that
virtually
every
safeguard
in
the
act
applies
to
the
sale
of
the
private
people,
persons
apply.
however,
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
are
not
specifically
provided
for
substitutes
for
some
of
these
requirements
such
as
the
public
auction
to
the
appraisal
procedure
arrived
at
through
expert
testimony
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
public
auction.
the
experts
determine
the
market
rather
than
bidders
which
i
think
is
the
same
thing.
i
thank
the
court
it
yield
back
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
federal
government
would,
yes
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
this
doctrine
obtained
in
arizona,
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
despite
the
eminent
domain
is
different
than
a
sale.
it's
partly
also
that
the
purpose
of
the
enabling
act
is
preserved
and
is
maintained
when
the
theory
of
valuation
and
compensation
that
we
advanced
is
followed,
i.e.,
that
the
trust
is
not
impaired
because
it
is
as
valuable
after
the
taking
as
it
was
before.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
capable
of
measurement
through
expert
testimony
and
through
analysis
of
the
effect
of
the
proposed
improvement
the
highway
on
the
remaining
trust
lands.
it
would
be
rather
unfair
if
the
state
builds
a
highway
that
opens
up
a
whole
new
section
of
the
state
which
is
replete
with
undispose
of
school
lands
and
has
to
take
cash
for
the
taking
of
the
school
land
in
the
other
--
on
the
one
hand,
on
the
other
hand,
the
school
land
is
a
tremendously
more
valuable
than
the
state,
the
schools
directly
benefit
in
increase
income.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
federal
government
pays
that.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
represented
this
court
but
that
was
never
in
our
mind
at
least
my
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
sir
i
would
not.
i
would
really
--
what
really
weighs
heavily
on
me
is
the
fact
that
the
state
highway
department
is
taking
for
a
public
purpose
that
is
an
act
which
is
of
value
to
the
taxpayer
or
the
citizen
of
the
state
as
a
whole.
it's
a
little
bit
different
than
a
private
acquisition.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
because
i
believe
that
the
value
of
the
trust
is
preserved
if
actual
benefits
accrue
the
remainder
and
therefore
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
essence
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think,
in
essence
that
is
what
would
happen.
that
is
an
adversary
proceeding
which
would
take
place
which
the
condemning
agency
of
the
highway
department
would
have
the
burden
of
establishing
these
benefits
as
offsets
against
what
they
would
ordinarily
owe
for
the
land
taking
and
i
would
say
that
the
normal
state
adversary
eminent
domain
proceeding
would
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
to
assess
them
would
be
to
actually
deprive
them
of
money
which
is
not
authorized
by
the
enabling
act
where
as
to
offset
benefits
to
them
would
be
to
preserve
the
value
of
the
trust
intact
so
that
it
would
still
have
the
capacity
to
earn
the
same
amount
of
money
for
the
state
school
system
or
perhaps
even
more
than
it
did
before
the
taking.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
a
requirement
is
maintained
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
establish
these
benefits
and
that
the
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that,
i
think
that's
correct.
however,
we
have
not
brief
and
i
do
not
dispute
that
the
state
has
authority
to
take
these
lands
as
an
eminent
domain
proceedings
for
public
purposes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
if
it
pays
for
which
and
i
just
--
i
simply
said
that
manner.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
still
simply
say
that
the
manner
of
payment
sometimes
can
be
and
in
the
context
of
the
state
ought
to
be
a
recognition
that
the
lands
are
compensated
by
the
benefits
resulting
from
the
improvement.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
the
benefit
--
the
burden
should
be
on
the
authority
which
is
taking
the
land.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
does
indeed
and
these
are
difficult
problems.
all
these
appraisals
are
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
would
say
that
it
certainly
is
simpler
and
i
would
not
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
certainly
safer
and
far
more
certain.
i
do
not
think
in
the
20th
century
though
that
you
require
that
rigid
safeguard
when
it
is
possible
in
an
impartial
forum
such
as
the
court
which
would
review
these
matters
i
presume
to
establish
what
has
really
happen.
expert
testimony
is
available
to
say
that
a
development
is
now
possible
in
this
far
of
the
state.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
that
is
true.
that
is
true
but
it
is
very
expensive
mr.
justice
black
as
we
know
in
the
lands
division.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
the
states
would
be
left
to
their
normal
procedure.
we're
suggesting
a
rule
that
i
think
would
be
a
minimum
rule
that
would
probably
satisfy
the
purpose
of
the
enabling
act
if
the
state
feels
that
it
should
be
more
for
example
adopt
the
rule
that's
proposed
by
mr.
frank
today,
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they'd
be
required
to
make
a
recognized
of
minimum
standards
such
as
the
one
the
government
advocates
here
but
they
will
be
free
to
treat
for
their
trust
as
much
accord
the
trust
to
a
much
greater
degree
of
protection
in
private
lands
or
the
same
degree
of
protection
as
private
lands
[audio

what
we
are
merely
proposing
i
reiterate
what
we
think
is
a
minimum
standard
would
preserve
this.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
state
--
yes
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
never
even
--
the
enabling
act
never
given
came
to
grips
with
eminent
domain
providing
that
the
lands
can
only
be
disposed
of
through
public
auction
is
not
really
an
indication
that
the
congress
intended
to
foreclose
the
eminent
domain.
i
think
they
were
concerned
with
the
problem
of
the
state
making
dispositions
to
private
parties
for
inadequate
considerations
as
it
had
in
these
tall
timber
cases.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
that
if
the
eminent
domain
power
is
so
inherent
the
power
of
the
sovereign
such
as
the
state
that
we
ought
to
require
a
great
deal
of
congress
before
we
rule
that
the
state
has
been
deprived
of
them.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
ervien
is
different
from
this
reason.
one
it
required
the
school
trust
to
actually
to
part
with
cash
income
that
it
received
from
these
lands
to
2
or
3%.
secondly,
the
benefit
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
precisely
the
point
i
made
about
the
benefits
or
i
tried
to
make,
perhaps
i
have
no
doubt
to
do
that
inadequately.
these
are
the
kind
of
benefits
that
are
highly
speculative
in
nature.
you
advertise
in
a
new
york
newspaper
that
one
ought
to
come
in
new
mexico
and
establish
a
business,
an
immediate
return
is
certainly
speculative.
we
all
may
feel
that
this
would
work
but
we
cannot
say
that
it
would.
however,
a
direct
benefit
such
as
a
road
that
opens
up
a
new
area
of
the
state
previously
had
no
access
to
markets
or
agricultural
products
for
example
i
think
can
be
said
to
have
enhanced
directly
in
market
value
by
virtue
of
the
construction
of
that
road
and
i
think
expert
testimony
would
withstand
cross-examination
could
be
produced
that
would
satisfy
a
court
that
the
benefit
had
accrued.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
9,100,000
acres.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
don't
believe
i
have
that
figure.
the
highway
department
perhaps
can
supply
that
justice
white.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
this
court.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
as
an
amicus
curiae
arises
because
of
the
federal
government's
interest
in
these
trust
lands
as
grantor
of
the
trust
lands
because
of
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
attorney
general
by
section
28
of
the
arizona,
new
mexico's
enabling
acts
and
because
of
course
of
the
federal
government's
growing
interest
in
the
field
of
education
and
its
financing.
before
i
embark
upon
the
details
of
its
position,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
as
of
the
counsel
for
the
state
land
department
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
that
is,
what
is
the
real
question
before
this
court?
is
it
simply
in
the
absolute
sense,
must
compensation
be
paid
by
the
state
when
it
takes
school
lands
for
public
purposes?
if
that
were
the
naked
question
before
this
court,
i
think
all
parties
would
say
that
perhaps
it
has
already
been
answered
by
agreement
for
even
the
state
highway
department
now
refers
in
its
brief
that
value
must
be
paid
for
these
school
trust
lands.
however,
they
say
that
the
value
is
paid
by
the
inherent
enhancement
that
arises
when
a
highway
is
built.
of
course,
in
a
real
sense
that
position
is
that
value
need
not
be
paid
because
if
you
can
conclusively
and
irrebuttably
presume
compensation
as
the
highway
enhancement
rather
as
the
highway
department
urges
you
will
foreclose
any
inquiry
as
to
what
really
happens
to
the
value
of
the
trust
when
the
lands
are
taken.
united
states
decision
in
this
case
is
that
you
must
look
at
the
trust
lands
as
a
whole
in
a
given
state.
they
are
there
to
produce
income
to
support
and
maintain
the
public
schools
of
that
state.
the
question
is
when
a
trust
land
is
taken
for
a
public
purpose
such
as
a
highway,
is
the
earning
power
of
that
trust
impaired?
is
it
no
longer
as
valuable
after
the
taking
as
it
was
before?
if
that
is
so,
and
the
trust
is
breached
and
what
the
state
has
done
is
wrong.
can
you
consider
the
question
of
enhancement
of
other
lands
when
you
take
a
parcel,
a
school
section
to
build
a
highway
and
i
think
you
can.
let
us
say
for
example
that
the
entire
value
of
the
lands
--
school
lands
in
the
state
is
$10
million
and
you
take
one
section
you
build
one
road
on
it.
clearly,
that
section
no
longer
has
a
value
in
itself
because
the
road
is
so
large
that
no
one
would
lease
it,
no
income
can
be
earned
from
that
school
section.
but
if
this
highway,
his
access
to
a
whole
new
portion
of
the
state
so
that
the
lands
there
can
now
leased
at
high
rental,
can
be
sold
for
high
prices
then
of
course
it
is
fair
to
state
that
the
trust
is
preserved
even
though
compensation
is
not
paid
by
the
state
for
the
particular
parcel.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
equally
reasonable
to
state
that
in
certain
cases,
a
taking
for
a
highway
will
result
in
no
enhancement
of
the
remainder
of
the
trust
and
the
total
value
the
trust
enhance
its
earning
power
will
be
diminished.
a
simple
example,
an
access
road
is
needed
to
make
it
easier
to
get
to
the
state
prison.
i
could
not
see
that
this
would
increase
the
pecuniary
value
of
other
school
lands
within
a
state
so
that
you
can
say
enhancement
can
be
presumed.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
doctrine
of
benefits
mr.
justice
fortas
is
applied
in
many
instances
in
eminent
domain
proceedings.
the
requirement
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
benefits
must
be
special
and
palpable
and
capable
of
ascertainment
not
merely
speculative.
that
is
you
can
say
it
is
more
than
you
can
say
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
is
nice
to
have
a
road
here.
you
have
to
say
that
there
is
a
road
here
now
and
the
remainder
of
this
man's
property
is
benefited
because
he
has
now
access
to
the
biggest
city
in
the
state,
he
now
can
develop
it
for
a
residential
purposes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
we
go
a
little
bit
further
because
in
eminent
domain
proceeding,
generally,
the
remaining
property
benefit
that
has
to
be
closer
physically
and
in
relation
in
terms
of
use
to
the
property
actually
taken.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
because
the
purpose
mr.
justice
is
to
preserve
a
trust
of
a
certain
value
so
that
it
can
earn
a
certain
amount
of
income
to
provide
for
public
school.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
we
agree
on
the
latter
part
of
your
statement
that
value
judgments
have
to
be
made.
the
reason
that
i
feel
you
can
go
a
little
further
than
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
is
that
the
state
highway
department
for
example
is
taking
a
road
for
a
public
purpose
to
require
to
pay
an
amount
of
money
that
will
make
the
trust
greater
afterwards
than
before
is
placing
an
undue
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
that
is
the
rule
in
condemnation
and
i
--
it
was
first
enunciated
by
this
court
as
early
as
1897,
in
the
case
called,
not
cited
in
our
briefs
bowman
against
ross.
the
requirement
is
that
the
benefits
have
to
be
readily
capable
of
ascertainment
than
measurable
so
that
an
expert
witness
and
remember
that
these
are
tested
in
adversary
forum
with
expert
testimony
on
it.
an
expert
witness
can
say
in
fact
your
property,
your
remaining
property
is
more
valuable,
you
can
sell
it
for
more.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
agree
completely.
we
simply
say
that
a
factual
determination
must
be
made
as
to
the
actual
effect
of
the
taking.
whether
which
is
one
that
is
capable
of
being
made
because
expert
testimony
would
be
available
to
inform
the
body
making
the
decision,
be
it
the
court
or
an
administrative
agency
as
to
whether
the
remainder
of
the
trust
is
enhanced
in
value
or
whether
it
is
not
enhanced
in
value.
the
minute
that
is
not
enhanced
in
value
of
course,
the
compensation
in
the
form
of
cash
must
be
paid
by
the
state
authority.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
they
are
treated
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
although
i
can't
say
this
with
great
confidence.
i
believe
they
are
treated
with
greater
strictness
that
is
our
rule
that
we
urge
here
is
somewhat
more
liberal
to
the
taking
authority
than
the
rule
in
respect
to
these
railroad
land
grants.
they
are
treated
like
private
persons
we
say
this
trust
may
be
treated
a
little
more
--
little
less
liberally.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
say
a
more
liberal
rule
of
benefits
can
be
applied
in
these
trust
lands
when
a
state,
another
state
agency
is
taking
them
that
is
if
you
look
through
the
benefits
of
the
trust
as
a
whole
rather
than
to
immediately
adjacent
parcel
of
property.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
they
apply
these
exact
same
rules
i
believe
to
other
lands
that
are
in
normal,
private
ownerships.
that
is
to
say
you
can
offset
benefits
against
compensation
due
provided
that
it
is
adjacently
in
the
same
use
and
what
have
you
but
you
can't
say
that
that
the
benefit
to
a
section,
thousand
miles
away
would
be
recognized
into
the
offset.
it
has
to
be
much
more
closed.
i
want
to
say
however
that
our
position
does
not
foreclose
a
state
paying
compensation
measured
by
the
rule
asserted
by
the
state
land
commissioner
petitioner
here.
we
are
saying
that
as
a
minimum,
we
think
the
requirements
maintained
by
the
trust
would
be
met
by
the
recognition
of
benefits
on
some
cases
when
they
are
actually
capable
of
ascertainment
and
measurement.
as
to
the
contentions
made
by
petitioner
that
the
recognitions
of
these
benefits
are
foreclosed
by
the
enabling
act,
i
think
what
congress
was
speaking
of
was
in
terms
of
actual
disposition
to
private
parties
which
is
a
quite
different
matter
than
changes
of
ownerships
through
eminent
domain
proceeding
the
latter
having
inherent
safeguards
of
judicial
review
of
an
initial
determination
at
least
in
arizona
by
an
administrative
agency
whereas
a
provision
relating
to
an
absolute
outright
sale
by
a
state
through
a
private
party
is
an
area
where
review
is
not
inherent
and
not
necessary.
in
fact
the
very
thing
complained
of
in
the
tall
timber
cases,
eminent
domain
where
both
parties
are
presumably
interested
in
the
public
good
and
the
public
benefit
is
quite
different.
i
think
the
enabling
act
permits
the
interpretation
that
we
quite
submit
of
that
is
benefits
to
the
remaining
land
can
be
recognized
and
compensation
in
some
cases
need
not
be
paid
in
form
of
cash
because
it
has
actually
resulted
in
terms
of
enhanced
value
to
the
remainder.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well
i
wouldn't
really
because
the
enabling
act
speaks
as
to
actual
voluntary
i
think
dispositions
by
the
state.
that
is
to
say,
these
are
truly
prohibited
by
the
enabling
act
whereas
eminent
domain
is
not
specifically
dealt
with
in
these
enabling
acts
and
i
think
it
was
probably
overlooked
by
the
congress.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
some
of
the
acts
for
example
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
if
it
is
for
a
recognized
public
purpose
for
which
the
state
has
the
condemnation
power,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
correct
whereas
the
enabling
act
specifically
require
a
minimum
most
of
them
do
anyway,
require
minimum
payments
for
disposition
to
private
persons.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
because
of
the
i
think
clear
congressional
purpose
to
create
a
trust
for
schools
to
preserve
the
value
of
that
trust
so
that
the
intent
of
congress
which
was
to
have
a
trust
for
schools
be
continued.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
requirement
for
preservation
of
a
trust
through
some
form
of
compensation
remains
in
eminent
domain
the
compensation
on
occasion
can
be
in
the
form
of
benefits
to
the
remainder
which
are
so
great
as
to
outweigh
the
amount
of
cash
loss
to
the
particular
track
of
land.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
we
agree
that
the
compensation
must
be
paid.
we
are
in
slight
disagreement
in
that
he
says
that
you
cannot
offset
general
benefits
to
the
remainder
of
the
trust.
you
have
to
actually
pay
cash
to
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
you
would
then
--
you
would
take
a
far
harsher
view,
we
would
say
that
virtually
every
safeguard
in
the
act
applies
to
the
sale
of
the
private
people,
persons
apply.
however,
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
are
not
specifically
provided
for
substitutes
for
some
of
these
requirements
such
as
the
public
auction
to
the
appraisal
procedure
arrived
at
through
expert
testimony
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
public
auction.
the
experts
determine
the
market
rather
than
bidders
which
i
think
is
the
same
thing.
i
thank
the
court
it
yield
back
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
federal
government
would,
yes
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
this
doctrine
obtained
in
arizona,
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
despite
the
eminent
domain
is
different
than
a
sale.
it's
partly
also
that
the
purpose
of
the
enabling
act
is
preserved
and
is
maintained
when
the
theory
of
valuation
and
compensation
that
we
advanced
is
followed,
i.e.,
that
the
trust
is
not
impaired
because
it
is
as
valuable
after
the
taking
as
it
was
before.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
capable
of
measurement
through
expert
testimony
and
through
analysis
of
the
effect
of
the
proposed
improvement
the
highway
on
the
remaining
trust
lands.
it
would
be
rather
unfair
if
the
state
builds
a
highway
that
opens
up
a
whole
new
section
of
the
state
which
is
replete
with
undispose
of
school
lands
and
has
to
take
cash
for
the
taking
of
the
school
land
in
the
other
--
on
the
one
hand,
on
the
other
hand,
the
school
land
is
a
tremendously
more
valuable
than
the
state,
the
schools
directly
benefit
in
increase
income.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
federal
government
pays
that.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
represented
this
court
but
that
was
never
in
our
mind
at
least
my
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
sir
i
would
not.
i
would
really
--
what
really
weighs
heavily
on
me
is
the
fact
that
the
state
highway
department
is
taking
for
a
public
purpose
that
is
an
act
which
is
of
value
to
the
taxpayer
or
the
citizen
of
the
state
as
a
whole.
it's
a
little
bit
different
than
a
private
acquisition.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
because
i
believe
that
the
value
of
the
trust
is
preserved
if
actual
benefits
accrue
the
remainder
and
therefore
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
essence
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think,
in
essence
that
is
what
would
happen.
that
is
an
adversary
proceeding
which
would
take
place
which
the
condemning
agency
of
the
highway
department
would
have
the
burden
of
establishing
these
benefits
as
offsets
against
what
they
would
ordinarily
owe
for
the
land
taking
and
i
would
say
that
the
normal
state
adversary
eminent
domain
proceeding
would
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
to
assess
them
would
be
to
actually
deprive
them
of
money
which
is
not
authorized
by
the
enabling
act
where
as
to
offset
benefits
to
them
would
be
to
preserve
the
value
of
the
trust
intact
so
that
it
would
still
have
the
capacity
to
earn
the
same
amount
of
money
for
the
state
school
system
or
perhaps
even
more
than
it
did
before
the
taking.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
a
requirement
is
maintained
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
establish
these
benefits
and
that
the
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
that,
i
think
that's
correct.
however,
we
have
not
brief
and
i
do
not
dispute
that
the
state
has
authority
to
take
these
lands
as
an
eminent
domain
proceedings
for
public
purposes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
if
it
pays
for
which
and
i
just
--
i
simply
said
that
manner.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
still
simply
say
that
the
manner
of
payment
sometimes
can
be
and
in
the
context
of
the
state
ought
to
be
a
recognition
that
the
lands
are
compensated
by
the
benefits
resulting
from
the
improvement.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
the
benefit
--
the
burden
should
be
on
the
authority
which
is
taking
the
land.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
does
indeed
and
these
are
difficult
problems.
all
these
appraisals
are
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
would
say
that
it
certainly
is
simpler
and
i
would
not
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
it
is
certainly
safer
and
far
more
certain.
i
do
not
think
in
the
20th
century
though
that
you
require
that
rigid
safeguard
when
it
is
possible
in
an
impartial
forum
such
as
the
court
which
would
review
these
matters
i
presume
to
establish
what
has
really
happen.
expert
testimony
is
available
to
say
that
a
development
is
now
possible
in
this
far
of
the
state.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
that
is
true.
that
is
true
but
it
is
very
expensive
mr.
justice
black
as
we
know
in
the
lands
division.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
the
states
would
be
left
to
their
normal
procedure.
we're
suggesting
a
rule
that
i
think
would
be
a
minimum
rule
that
would
probably
satisfy
the
purpose
of
the
enabling
act
if
the
state
feels
that
it
should
be
more
for
example
adopt
the
rule
that's
proposed
by
mr.
frank
today,
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
they'd
be
required
to
make
a
recognized
of
minimum
standards
such
as
the
one
the
government
advocates
here
but
they
will
be
free
to
treat
for
their
trust
as
much
accord
the
trust
to
a
much
greater
degree
of
protection
in
private
lands
or
the
same
degree
of
protection
as
private
lands
[audio
cut]
what
we
are
merely
proposing
i
reiterate
what
we
think
is
a
minimum
standard
would
preserve
this.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
the
state
--
yes
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
never
even
--
the
enabling
act
never
given
came
to
grips
with
eminent
domain
providing
that
the
lands
can
only
be
disposed
of
through
public
auction
is
not
really
an
indication
that
the
congress
intended
to
foreclose
the
eminent
domain.
i
think
they
were
concerned
with
the
problem
of
the
state
making
dispositions
to
private
parties
for
inadequate
considerations
as
it
had
in
these
tall
timber
cases.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
think
that
if
the
eminent
domain
power
is
so
inherent
the
power
of
the
sovereign
such
as
the
state
that
we
ought
to
require
a
great
deal
of
congress
before
we
rule
that
the
state
has
been
deprived
of
them.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
ervien
is
different
from
this
reason.
one
it
required
the
school
trust
to
actually
to
part
with
cash
income
that
it
received
from
these
lands
to
2
or
3%.
secondly,
the
benefit
--
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
precisely
the
point
i
made
about
the
benefits
or
i
tried
to
make,
perhaps
i
have
no
doubt
to
do
that
inadequately.
these
are
the
kind
of
benefits
that
are
highly
speculative
in
nature.
you
advertise
in
a
new
york
newspaper
that
one
ought
to
come
in
new
mexico
and
establish
a
business,
an
immediate
return
is
certainly
speculative.
we
all
may
feel
that
this
would
work
but
we
cannot
say
that
it
would.
however,
a
direct
benefit
such
as
a
road
that
opens
up
a
new
area
of
the
state
previously
had
no
access
to
markets
or
agricultural
products
for
example
i
think
can
be
said
to
have
enhanced
directly
in
market
value
by
virtue
of
the
construction
of
that
road
and
i
think
expert
testimony
would
withstand
cross-examination
could
be
produced
that
would
satisfy
a
court
that
the
benefit
had
accrued.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
9,100,000
acres.
mr.
edwin
l.
weisl,
jr.
i
don't
believe
i
have
that
figure.
the
highway
department
perhaps
can
supply
that
justice
white.
thank
you.
