mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
a
regulation
of
the
state
land
commissioner
of
arizona,
mr.
obed
lassen,
my
client
here
which
requires
that
certain
lands
granted
in
trust
to
the
state
of
arizona
by
the
federal
government
should
be
paid
for
if
they
are
to
be
taken
for
the
uses
which
i
am
going
to
discuss.
the
background
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are
interpreting
an
act
of
congress
passed
in
the
year
1910.
at
that
time,
there
was
pending
the
proposal
to
admit
the
47th
and
48th
states,
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
an
enabling
act
was
about
to
be
passed.
the
legislation
was
to
contain
as
in
the
typical
acts
for
the
admission
of
new
states
provisions
to
provide
public
lands
essentially
and
primarily
for
schools.
in
this
case,
it
was
contemplated
that
there
would
be
ten
and
a
half
million
acres
of
land
given
to
the
state
of
arizona
and
a
similar
amount
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
be
held
in
trust
for
this
purpose.
but
there
had
been
a
background
in
what
was
then
the
territory
of
new
mexico
which
disturbed
the
congress
very
much.
there
had
been
what
were
known
as
the
tall
timber
cases
in
which
the
practice
had
a
reason
of
despoiling
public
lands
in
new
mexico
by
the
devise
of
purporting
to
sell
lands,
having
them
stripped
off
their
mineral
or
timber
to
assets
and
then
giving
them
back
to
the
state
again
and
so
as
against
this
background
in
this
act,
the
congress
wished
to
be
particularly
careful
and
so
it
was
and
it
provided
not
only
as
had
been
the
tradition
in
other
acts
that
the
proceeds
of
public
lands
should
be
held
in
trust.
the
congress
also
provided
in
this
joint
act
for
the
two
states
that
the
very
lands
themselves
should
be
held
in
trust
and
it
provided
further
that
those
lands
could
never
be
disposed
of
except
by
the
devise
of
public
auction
and
that
they
never
could
they
be
disposed
of
except
after
an
appraisal
which
would
determine
the
true
value
thereof.
there
was
a
minimum
offset
price
of
so
and
so
many
dollars
in
paper
but
beyond
that
it
was
provided
that
the
land
should
not
be
sold
or
leased
i
quote
the
statute
in
a
whole
or
in
part
except
to
the
highest
and
best
bidder.
and
if
was
further
provided
in
this
section
and
i
think
is
of
special
importance
that
all
lands,
leaseholds,
timber
and
other
products
should
be
appraised
of
their
true
value
and
no
sale
or
no
other
disposal
thereof
should
be
made
for
a
consideration
less
than
the
value
so
ascertained.
under
that
statute
then
the
lands
were
given
to
the
two
states
and
the
practical
experience
has
been
that
they
have
been
frugally
handled
to
the
great
benefit
of
education
in
both
of
these
states.
in
new
mexico,
which
has
a
keen
interest
here
because
as
your
honor
understands,
the
identical
statute
in
the
same
provisions
and
hence
we
are
joined
here
by
mr.
jordan,
assistant
attorney
general
from
new
mexico.
in
new
mexico
something
in
the
amount
of
40%
of
the
educational
funds
of
the
state
have
been
developed
from
these
lands
and
some
$200
million
has
been
held
in
trust.
in
our
own
state
we
have
taken
a
more
conservative
approach
to
the
use
of
the
lands
of
the
lands
and
we
still
have
nine
and
a
half
million
of
the
ten
and
a
half
million
acres
in
the
trust
and
the
proceeds
of
the
remainder
are
held
in
a
permanent
school
fund
and
are
used
for
the
purposes
of
developing
education
in
arizona.
these
lands
as
enormous
ten
million
acre
track
i
must
make
clear
is
scattered
throughout
the
state.
we're
not
talking
about
a
sector
or
part
of
a
reservation.
it's
rather
a
checker
boarding
of
the
whole
state
to
establish
the
public
lands.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
these
are
(voice
overlap).
for
the
most
part
except
as
they
may
be
subject
to
grazing
or
very
short
term
leases
are
simply
held
that's
part
of
our
vast
acreage,
your
honor,
is
perhaps
aware
that
in
our
state
there
were
80%
of
the
total
land
of
the
state
as
public
land
of
one
sort
or
another.
this
is
a
relatively
small
patch
of
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
these
are
non-income
producing
lands
being
held
for
use,
a
million
acres
has
been
disposed
of
in
a
fashion
which
i
have
described.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
your
honor.
i
have
said
that
these
lands
were
put
in
trust
and
i
have
emphasized
that
because
it
dramatizes
the
extraordinary
care
congress
took
in
this
case
but
functionally
it's
all
the
same.
and
that's
why
eight
states
have
joined
us
in
our
position
here
today
and
why
we
are
generally
supported
by
all
of
the
states
because
what
has
happened
in
arizona
is
a
peculiar
localism
unique
to
that
one
area
but
one
which
creates
a
precedent
which
at
this
period
will
prejudice
all
the
public
stands
of
the
western
states.
to
be
precise,
as
to
what
has
happened.
a
question
when
lands
are
to
be
used
for
highways.
and
lands
are
to
be
used
for
highways
and
for
transportation
or
for
some
such
purpose
and
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
why
i
used
that
broad
term.
they
must
be
paid
for
and
when
the
lands
are
taken
for
example
to
put
in
a
road
or
a
utility
line
or
something
of
this
sort,
do
the
provisions
of
the
trust
law
which
provided
all
of
the
lands
without
exception
shall
be
paid
for
in
the
minimum
value
do
they
apply
or
is
there
some
reason
for
making
an
exception
and
not
making
a
charge
for
those
purposes.
what
has
happened
in
our
own
state
is
i
think
a
product
of
the
peculiar
road
building
background
there.
we
are
in
a
state
which
is
one
has
developed
relatively
recently
and
in
the
earlier
periods,
local
and
county
roads
consisted
as
some
of
you
has
seen
there
a
little
more
than
running
out
of
a
drag
device
across
the
desert
than
sending
a
car
long
after.
there
were
decisions
in
our
state
and
only
in
our
state
with
an
exception
i
shall
mention
in
the
40s
holding
that
those
did
not
need
to
be
paid
for
under
the
enabling
act.
the
situation
has
no
radically
changed
because
the
roads
become
gigantic
boulevard
in
interstate
highways
and
we're
talking
about
enormous
quantities
of
land.
and
in
these
circumstances,
the
land
commissioner
of
arizona
who
is
the
trustee,
mr.
lassen,
issued
a
regulation
and
this
regulation
provided
that
lands
to
be
taken
for
highway
purposes
should
be
appraised
and
could
be
made
available
for
this
purpose
but
only
at
their
true
value
after
appraisal.
now,
at
that
point,
the
highway
department
of
the
state
instituted
this
action.
and
this
action
is
a
suit
in
the
nature
under
our
practice
of
a
written
provision
brought
by
the
highway
department
against
the
land
department
to
prohibit
it
from
enforcing
that
regulation.
the
matter
was
presented
to
our
supreme
court
below,
and
the
problem
that
was
presented
there
is
also
a
problem
here
that
the
attorney
general
is
in
the
sense
in
both
sides
because
he
represents
both
state
agencies.
this
is
perfectly
appropriate
under
our
practice.
it
is
i'm
surely
highly
undesirable
under
yours.
so
that
what
happened
there
was
is
a
practical
matter
that
the
representation
of
the
highway
department
was
placed
on
the
hands
of
the
firm
which
represents
a
major
utility.
a
reclamation
utility
which
wishes
i
am
sure
to
follow
along
and
put
its
lines
in
without
thing
for
them
to.
the
utility
appeared
in
support
of
the
highway
department
amicus
in
the
trial
court.
meanwhile
the
teachers
of
the
state
have
the
deepest
possible
interest
in
the
future
of
the
education
and
of
educational
lands
and
i
was
retained
especially
by
the
teachers
for
the
purpose
of
filing
an
amicus
brief
there
and
have
been
denominated
a
wholly
nominal
assistant
--
special
assistant
attorney
general
but
in
fact
representative
of
the
educational
interest
in
the
state
to
bring
the
matter
here.
now,
i
pause
with
those
details
to
make
clear
that
i
think
we
meet
the
standard
of
genuine
adversary
proceedings
and
it
is
adversary
indeed
but
i
felt
that
you
should
know
what
the
background
circumstances
of
the
representation
ought.
the
matter
as
they
say
came
before
our
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
court
in
a
lengthy
opinion
held
that
regardless
of
the
trust
language
the
lands
need
not
need
to
be
paid
for
and
thus
prohibited
the
use
of
the
land
department's
regulation
we
brought
them
out
of
here.
now,
what
is
it
that
is
the
decision
or
the
essence
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below?
what
it
comes
to
is
this.
well,
it's
a
lengthy
opinion
it
can
boil
down
to
only
a
couple
of
sentences
and
those
are
set
forth
and
i'll
simply
mention
them
because
you'll
then
have
in
the
nutshell
exactly
what
the
decision
was
in
the
controversy
is.
the
court
below
said
that
these
lands
need
not
be
paid
for
and
that
the
enabling
act
and
that
these
provisions
which
i
have
read
here
need
not
be
observed.
first,
because
and
i
quote
"the
respective
right
of
way
for
these
highways
takes
less
than
a
fee
estate".
in
other
words,
they
said,
this
is
only
taking
an
easement
and
when
you
take
an
easement
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
it.
second,
the
court
below
said
the
trust
and
its
beneficiaries
the
school
lands
are
not
deprived
of
anything
of
value.
it
is
well
known
that
good
highways
throughout
the
state
increase
the
value
of
the
lands.
in
other
words,
the
court
below
reached
its
results
under
two
grounds,
(a)
that
this
is
a
taking
of
an
easement
and
that
therefore
that's
free
and
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
it.
and
on
the
ground
(b)
that
the
school
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
far
from
it
your
honor.
it
is
not
only
natural
but
let
me
direct
myself
to
that
because
nobody
seriously
supports
that
position
of
our
supreme
court
here.
the
government
has
not
said
a
word
in
behalf
of
us
and
neither
has
the
other
side.
now,
in
the
first
place
your
honor,
while
it
may
be
true
or
not
that
taking
an
easement
is
that
the
taking
of
roads
for
our
purposes
is
a
matter
of
taking
an
easement.
this
is
immaterial
and
frankly
non-rational
for
two
reasons.
first,
clearly
from
every
practical
standpoint
only
in
interstate
highway
across
the
land
of
the
state
of
arizona
with
tons
of
concrete
on
the
ground
is
in
every
functional
sense
identical
to
taking
a
fee
that
makes
any
difference.
but
secondly
and
the
reason
why
this
becomes
immaterial
and
i
shall
not
mention
it
again
and
i
am
sure
you'll
hear
no
more
of
it
from
the
other
side,
is
that
the
statute
clearly
is
the
--
i
am
speaking
of
the
enabling
act.
the
enabling
act
isn't
restricted
to
the
taking
of
fee
interest.
the
enabling
act
says
that
there
must
be
payment
in
full
at
the
appraised
value
for
the
--
for
any,
it
uses
that
broad
term
for
any
disposition
of
the
lands
and
on
top
of
that
it
nails
it
down
your
honor
by
saying
that
there
must
be
taking
in
full
for
the
use
of
the
lands
so
that
regarding
the
easement
as
regarding
this
as
an
easement
if
it
is
and
it
clearly
from
the
functional
standpoint
would
be
almost
absurd
the
use
of
property
concepts
but
regarding
at
as
such
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
the
statute
says
that
whether
you
take
this
position
any
disposition
what
you
take
the
use
of
is
immaterial.
so
the
matter
comes
to
the
remaining
elements
of
the
case
and
that
remaining
element
of
the
case
what
the
court
below
has
said
here
in
essence
that
it
had
--
i
mean
to
judge
you
by
it
but
it
is
similar
to
the
--
what's
good
for
general
motors
is
good
for
the
country
approach.
what
the
court
below
is
saying
is
roads
are
good
for
the
state,
what's
good
for
the
state
is
good
for
the
school
lands.
this
will
increase
the
value
of
the
school
lands;
therefore
you
don't
need
to
pay
for
it.
what's
for
the
general
good
is
sufficient
and
there
need
not
be
dollars
in
hand
paid,
that's
the
essence
of
the
decision
below
and
it's
the
essence
of
what
has
been
the
peculiar
arizona
position
on
this
subject.
now,
in
the
first
place
your
honor,
allow
to
devote
myself
to
that
subject
for
the
balance
of
my
argument.
we
begin
number
one
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
we
begin
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
expressly
in
the
clearest
possible
way
says
that
lands
are
to
be
paid
for.
it
does
not
permit
of
the
so-called
doctrine
of
enhancement.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
land
shall
be
valued
and
that
there
should
be
credited
against
the
value
whatever
plus
that
there
may
be
thought
become
as
a
result
of
the
taking
but
nothing
like
that
is
in
this
law
at
all.
instead
it
does
in
the
most
expressed
possible
way
put
certain
statutory
minimum
and
then
in
the
most
exact
possible
way
says
that
there
should
be
an
appraisal
and
there
should
be
no
sale
of
any
lands
or
disposition
of
any
lands,
any
taking
for
any
use
of
any
land
except
of
that
level
of
value.
now,
i
have
begun
by
saying
that
this
was
a
statute
which
have
had
very
close
congressional
attention
particularly
because
of
the
background
of
land
scandals
against
which
it
was
passed.
and
this
is
so
your
honors,
they
--
we
have
set
forth
a
good
deal
of
the
legislative
histories
in
our
briefs
and
i
won't
give
you
more
than
the
flavor
of
it
here.
but
i
wish
to
note
that
these
particular
restrictions
were
added
in
their
final
forum
by
the
senate
committee
after
full
hearings
and
that
the
report
show
great
emphasis
on
what
the
statute
says
so
that
the
senate
report
says
that
these
lands
shall
be
held
in
trust
to
be
disposed
of
only
as
therein
provided
and
the
question
was
expressly
considered
before
one
of
the
congressional
committees
are
these
restrictions
too
heavy?
are
they
severe,
can
you
live
with
these?
it
is
alright?
and
the
representative
of
arizona
appearing
before
the
committee,
appearing
in
behalf
of
the
territory
in
asking
for
statehood
said
that
when
asked
about
these
careful
restrictions
based
on
the
lands
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
question
he
said
i
believe
the
restrictions
on
such
public
lands
cannot
be
made
too
broad.
in
other
words,
the
territory
in
asking
for
statehood
was
welcoming
the
very
kind
of
provisions
which
in
fact
were
put
into
this
law
and
the
report
of
the
interior
department
shows
that
in
--
as
a
result
of
the
very
investigation
that
have
been
made
of
land
frauds,
these
provisions
saying
you
can
only
take
it
this
way,
you
can
only
price
it
this
way
had
been
put
in.
the
final
report
of
the
senate
committee
began
and
i
give
you
this
as
indication
of
the
tremendous
earnestness
of
which
the
committee
approach
the
problem
began
your
committee
cannot
too
earnestly
call
attention
to
the
extreme
care
that
should
be
taken
with
every
provision
of
a
bill
like
this
and
i
go
on
to
tell
that
but
they
were
particularly
meticulous
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
and
this
matter
of
legislation.
now,
what
has
happened
since?
we
have
had
not
merely
a
legislative
history
of
great
care.
we
have
had
a
subsequent
congressional
development
of
great
care
in
dealing
with
this
act.
because
this
act
is
of
course
subject
to
amendment
and
the
point
is
that
whenever
it
has
been
proposed
that
there
be
any
deviation
from
these
careful
pricing
terms
or
from
the
careful
disposition
terms
the
interested
parties
have
gone
back
to
congress
and
presented
the
matter
and
they
have
gotten
an
amendment
if
congress
wanted
to
give
it
and
because
this
trust
was
accepted
by
the
state
of
arizona
and
is
part
of
our
constitution,
this
may
require
an
amendment
to
our
state
constitution
as
well.
but
to
give
one
illustration
just
a
single
illustration
which
will
dramatize
it
i
think.
we
have
a
little
village
in
our
state
called
the
town
of
benson
and
the
town
of
benson
is
so
small
that
it
was
unable
when
it
wanted
a
section
of
land
just
that
small
amount
for
a
public
park
to
pay
the
$3.50
an
acre
amount
which
would
be
needed
even
for
that
600
acres.
they
simply
couldn't
afford
it.
we
are
talking
about
a
very
small
town.
and
therefore,
an
amendment
was
passed
through
the
congress
which
expressly
authorized
the
giving
of
a
section
of
land,
a
single
section
to
the
town
of
benson
without
compensation
and
the
legislative
history
expressly
shows
that
this
was
done
because
there
was
no
way
of
dedicating
that
one
section
for
a
public
use
except
by
paying
for
it
other
than
by
this
amendment
of
the
act.
now,
your
honors,
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
am
sure
no
one
did
then
when
the
sincere
truly
sincere
people
who
passed
that
act
passed
it
but
they
felt
that
the
giving
of
this
section
to
benson
would
improve
the
value
of
the
town
of
benson
and
improve
values
of
the
land
around
it
and
doubtlessly
the
giving
of
that
section
would
do
something
for
the
general
values
of
all
of
the
rest
of
the
school
line
of
the
region
or
the
state
or
whatever
but
the
point
is
that
it
was
not
supposed
that
the
piddling
amount
of
$2000.00
worth
of
land
could
be
disposed
of
without
compensation
except
by
an
act
of
congress
and
yet
under
the
arizona
decision
and
practice
from
which
we
appeal,
$9
million
worth
of
land
have
been
taken
from
this
school
trust
funds
already
and
are
irretrievably
gone
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
your
honor
and
that
only
says
that
the
--
not
only
that
the
constitution
says
so
but
the
enabling
act
says
so
that
any
transfer
is
null
and
void
and
whether
in
those
circumstances
mr.
lassen
will
be
able
to
bring
some
appropriate
action
to
try
to
recover
as
to
those
things
whether
it's
a
matter
of
policy
will
do
so
i
must
say
i
think
we
don't
know
whether
there
will
be
any
retrieval
because
this
practice
of
dribbling
away
our
trust
funds
has
been
going
on
for
20
years.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
must
say
in
candid
that
i
am
in
doubt
because
the
state
is
simply
not
considered
how
to
deal
with
this
problem
or
at
least
has
not
advice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
this
is
not
the
reason.
we
have
had
such
an
action.
it
is
clear
that
it
ought
to
arise
and
it
is
clear
that
the
trust
had
been
invaded
to
this
amount
but
i
cannot
with
a
responsibility
with
which
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question
state
what
would
happen
because
thoroughly
--
because
we're
dealing
really
with
the
public
land
law
of
all
of
the
states,
we
would
have
at
that
point
to
make
a
research
as
to
how
this
has
been
treated
elsewhere
and
i
am
sure
there
would
be
residents
on
the
point
with
some
of
the
jurisdictions
but
we
simply
don't
know.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well,
i
want
to
turn
to
that
your
honor
and
with
some
care,
as
to
the
eminent
domain
face
of
the
matter,
there
is
a
division
of
authority
on
that
and
with
your
permission
since
that
that
becomes
a
major
part
of
my
discussion
i
like
to
--
may
i
reserve
that
one
question
for
just
a
moment
mr.
justice?
have
i
met
your
point
at
the
best
of
my
ability
mr.
justice
fortas?
the
argument
which
is
made
here
then
by
the
other
side
is
that
enhancement
of
value
is
to
be
presumed
and
that
this
is
to
be
presumed
to
be
an
offset
so
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
the
lands
when
you
take
them,
whether
you
take
them
for
highway
purposes
or
for
utility
or
other
purposes
for
which
they
might
be
taken.
now,
there
is
this
difference
of
position
amongst
our
adversaries
and
i
identified
only
so
that
i
may
sharply
and
fairly
state
our
own
position.
the
position
of
our
adversaries
divides
in
this.
the
highway
department
as
you
will
shortly
hear
from
takes
the
position
as
the
court
below
did
that
one
must
always
presume
that
there
is
enough
value
created
by
a
road
so
you
never
have
to
pay.
you
should
be
thankful
that
a
piece
of
your
land
is
taken
under
the
road
is
put
upon.
the
position
of
the
federal
government
is
difficult.
the
land
division
takes
the
position
that
we
are
right
in
principle
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
should
be
reversed
but
that
in
some
instances,
it
will
turn
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
is
an
enhancement
of
value
as
a
result
of
the
road
and
that
therefore
there
need
be
no
compensation.
our
position
on
that
point
and
our
position
on
the
total
matter
is
this,
we
say
when
congress
established
this
trust
it
could
have
provided
for
an
enhancement
theory
of
valuation
if
it
wanted
to.
it
could
have
been
put
in
to
the
statute
a
provision
that
there
shall
be
credited
back
any
value
which
is
assumed
to
exist
as
a
result
of
the
disposition
of
the
land.
after
all
the
land
was
congress
says
to
give
away,
it
could
have
made
its
own
conditions
but
the
point
is
that
it
vary
clearly
didn't.
it
simply
didn't
see
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no
i
think
not
mr.
justice.
i'm
afraid
i
got
into
the
double
negative
here.
i
think
that
the
matter
needs
to
be
before
you
in
this
that
if
you
reject
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
if
you
adopt
our
position,
should
that
appeal
to
you
then
it
would
necessarily
follow
and
there
must
in
candor
now
just
as
the
government
position
falls
to
because
it
is
our
position
and
the
request
we
make
to
this
court
in
this
appeal
is
that
the
statute
is
to
be
enforced.
that
the
statute
provides
for
a
system
of
valuation,
this
regulation
provides
for
a
system
of
valuation.
this
regulation
which
we
are
asking
be
upheld
says
that
no
lands
may
be
disposed
of
except
that
they
appraise
value.
it's
taken
from
verbatim
from
the
statute
and
if
therefore
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
reversed
and
the
regulation
is
thereby
upheld
so
that
be
the
result
then
i
would
think
that
the
government
position
could
fall
with
it
so
that
i
am
compelled
to
say
that
that
question
is
so
interlock
here
that
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
separated
out
perhaps
by
ingenious
drafting
one
might
come
up
with
an
opinion
that
did
not
reach
that
matter
and
of
course
that's
all
is
possible.
but
i
believe
in
all
candor
it's
here,
mr.
lassen's
regulation
says
that
there
shall
be
an
appraisal
and
no
disposition
of
the
lands
except
that
the
appraised
value
in
every
and
does
not
provide
for
a
credit
in
case
of
some
incremental
value
as
this
assumes.
now,
the
matter
which
is
before
us
is
not
one
of
first
impression
on
this
court.
virtually
the
identical
question
has
been
before
you
previously
in
the
case
of
ervien
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself.
i
should
make
clear
that
the
various
states
have
also
dealt
with
this
subject
as
one
of
you
asked
me
earlier
is
this,
i
think
you
did
is
as
typical
of
the
other
land
states,
the
answer
is
yes.
this
question
crops
up
in
substantially
all
of
them.
there
is
one
case
and
one
only
in
the
country
which
is
against
our
present
position.
there
was
an
early
wyoming
case,
the
decision
of
ross
which
takes
essentially
the
view
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
what
you
have
before
you
a
brief
from
the
attorney
general
of
which
the
attorney
general
of
wyoming
has
joined
showing
that
that
is
not
in
fact
followed
in
that
jurisdiction.
and
the
whole
weight
of
the
state
cases
has
been
as
i
am
arguing
here
a
leading
example
is
the
case
of
walker
which
comes
from
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
there
was
thus
a
flat
conflict
just
directly
on
this
very
statute,
new
mexico
and
walker
having
decided
this
question
the
opposite
way
of
way
in
which
arizona
has
decided
but
apart
from
those
state
cases
which
are
adequately
discussed
in
the
brief,
apart
from
those
cases,
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ervien
which
is
a
matter
which
arose
from
new
mexico.
what
happened
there
was
this.
the
state
of
new
mexico
with
a
foreshadowing
of
this
exact
point
of
view
had
said,
a
good
advertising
program
for
our
state
is
just
what
we
need
and
it
will
increase
the
value
of
all
of
the
lands.
everybody
will
be
better
off
as
a
result
and
therefore
trust
funds
may
be
used
for
this
general
promotional
purpose
and
we
will
assume
that
there
will
be
a
sufficient
value
caused
by
those
--
that
advertising
program,
so
that
the
lands
will
gain
more
than
they
lose
by
this
disposition
of
the
funds.
now,
that
matter
was
put
into
issue
and
in
coming
into
issue
it
came
here
following
an
extensive
consideration
of
the
matter
in
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
the
almost
precise
point
was
considered
that
is
the
exact
highway
question
just
what
we're
talking
about,
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
is
it
would
be
but
a
step
further
to
argue
the
advantage
that
would
approve
to
the
trust
from
the
physical
construction
of
and
so
on
and
then
it
says
specifically
such
as
systems
of
public
highways.
in
other
words,
in
ervien
the
eighth
circuit
expressly
held
out
the
use
of
the
funds
for
public
highway
purposes
as
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
which
was
not
to
be
allowed.
this
court
adopted
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
you
had
a
short
opinion
of
your
own
but
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
is
expressly
incorporated
by
reference
here
and
this
court
said
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
these
words
to
preclude
any
license
of
construction
or
liberties
of
inference.
it
was
declared
that
the
disposition
of
any
of
the
land
for
any
purpose
other
than
that
provided
therein
would
be
deemed
to
breach
of
trust
and
this
court
said
the
dedication
we
repeat
was
"special
and
exact".
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
the
case
of
ervien,
your
honor,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
and
17
the
citation
here
is
251
u.s.41.
now,
your
honors
what
then
is
the
argument
that
is
made
for
the
other
side?
what
is
the
contention
which
is
before
us?
here
we
have
a
statute
that
in
so
many
words,
really
is
as
fairly
as
it's
possible
to
speak
english.
we
have
a
statute
which
in
so
many
words
says,
that
lands
must
be
paid
for
and
that
this
is
how
you
do
it
and
they
have
to
appraise.
the
argument
that
has
been
made
for
the
other
side
is
essentially
that
an
enabling
act
simply
doesn't
have
to
obeyed
that
strictly
but
the
states
are
entitled
to
take
a
latitudinarian
view
of
their
enabling
acts.
the
argument
is
made
essentially
and
it
is
based
almost
entirely
on
the
case
of
coyle
against
smith.
now,
that
was
the
case
involving
the
oklahoma
enabling
act
and
it
was
the
one
under
which
it
was
held
that
as
an
equal
footing
matter.
oklahoma
could
move
its
capital
from
one
place
to
another
regardless
of
the
provision
of
the
enabling
act.
this
was
on
the
grounds
of
equal
footing.
your
honors,
that
case
coyle
against
smith
far
from
being
authority
for
the
proposition
for
which
are
decided
happens
to
be
expressed
authority
going
the
other
way
because
the
movement
of
the
capital
was
held
to
be
a
matter
of
equal
footing
rights
but
this
court
in
that
case
expressly
said
that
this
would
not
apply
to
regulations,
i
am
quoting,
"touching
the
sole
care
and
disposition
of
the
public
lands
or
reservations
therein."
so
that
in
other
words,
coyle
against
smith
was
an
expressed
example
of
the
sort
of
thing
which
was
not
to
be
allowed.
i
will
turn
if
i
may
to
justice
white's
question
after
lunch.
mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
am
advised
by
my
associates
that
i
may
have
misled
an
answer
to
you.
you
asked
about
leasing
and
i
meant
to
say
and
i
think
i
did
that
the
revenues
were
not
substantial.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
lands
are
leased.
mr.
john
p.
frank
there
are
leases
but
they
don't
graze
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
now,
i
would
like
to
take
the
bulk
of
my
few
remaining
minutes
if
i
can
save
a
tiny
bit
i
shall
but
i
may
be
unable
to
answer
justice
white's
question
which
raises
the
one
i
think
really
have
a
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
justice
white,
the
question
arises
are
these
trust
lands
subject
to
eminent
domain
at
all?
the
answer
at
least
in
the
cases
is
this,
under
virtually
vertical
language
in
1903
idaho
decision
which
we've
discussed
fully
says
yes,
that
they
can
be,
that
they
are
subject
to
eminent
domain.
in
1910,
montana
decision
is
the
opposite.
it
rejected
the
idaho
decision
and
said
no.
our
act
was
passed
just
before
the
montana
decision.
in
1921,
congress
passed
the
statute
dealing
with
the
argument
raised
by
the
montana
decision
and
in
that
act
which
dealt
only
with
the
states
under
that
particular
enabling
act,
it
didn't
amend
the
law
generally,
congress
declined
to
take
a
position.
it
said
we
don't
have
to
decide
its
language
was
a
strict
and
perhaps
accurate
interpretation
of
the
acts
with
bar
eminent
domain
therefore,
in
order
to
remedy
this
situation,
we
expressly
allow
it
and
in
that
act
they
did.
now,
how
does
that
bear
in
that
situation?
what
our
land
commissioner
has
done
is
to
provide
that
all
land
must
go
by
appraisal
but
on
the
other
hand
under
this
regulation
he
does
not
require
that
it
be
sold
at
public
auction.
the
statute
says
it
must
be
sold
at
public
auction.
this
regulation
does
not
do
that.
it
does
not
because
the
appraisal
procedure
is
part
of
our
state
eminent
domain
procedure.
and
he
has
consciously
imported
the
imminent
domain
devise
following
the
idaho
decision
and
sought
to
use
it
on
the
theory
that
the
eminent
domain
procedures
can
be
applied
and
therefore
he
takes
the
appraisal
device
from
our
eminent
domain
law
but
does
not
require
the
option.
if
this
is
permitted
mr.
justice
white
it
is
implied
exception
under
the
theory
of
west
river
bridge
and
dix
that
all
acts
are
subject
to
the
eminent
domain
power.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
think
this
is
the
sound
review
when
we've
advanced
it
in
our
brief.
we
think
this
is
acceptable.
i
also
wish
to
make
clear
that
this
is
not
of
the
essence
of
our
position.
in
other
words,
we
could
perfectly
well
go
through
to
the
form
of
appearing
to
auction
off
a
50-mile
strip
of
a
thousand
feet
wide.
obviously,
there's
only
going
to
be
one
bidder
and
it
would
be
a
pure
ceremony.
but
that
can
be
done
and
while
it's
not
in
the
regulation,
we
haven't
the
faintest
objection
of
putting
it
there
if
this
court
feels
that
we
can
impart
eminent
domain
theory
into
this
case.
so,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it's
essentially
a
matter
of
indifference
but
i
do
report
that
the
problem
does
exist,
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
here
and
we
have
in
our
actual
conduct
attempted
to
apply
that
procedure.
now,
i
may
simply
say
this
in
conclusion
and
i
hope
i
am
saving
a
moment.
the
congress
has
given
10
million
acres
to
the
state
of
arizona.
it
did
pass
an
act
with
what
the
congressional
committee
report
shows
was
extreme
care
with
painstaking
care.
this
court
has
said
that
it
was
a
painstakingly
careful
act
about
your
own
language.
now,
let
me
simply
put
this
question
to
my
friends
who
are
next
to
me.
if
you
have
the
task
of
drafting
a
statute,
if
you
were
a
member
of
congress,
if
you
wanted
to
draft
an
act
which
would
provide
that
all
lands
that
were
taken
had
to
be
paid
for
in
appraised
value.
how
would
you
possibly
do
it
any
more
precisely
than
to
say
that
all
lands,
leaseholds,
timbers
and
other
products
before
bringing
offer
for
any
sale
or
other
disposal
shall
be
appraised
as
a
true
value
and
no
sale
shall
be
made
for
less
than
that
amount.
i
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
the
english
language
to
be
more
exact,
more
precise,
more
specific
than
this
and
i
leave
my
adversaries
with
a
question
suppose
the
congress
of
the
united
states
didn't
want
to
do
exactly
what
we're
saying
it
did
here.
how
could
it
conceivably
have
done
a
better
job
than
it
has
been
done
in
this
case
in
this
very
case?
our
state
stands
alone
in
this
country
and
taking
the
view,
the
trust
lands
can
be
taken
and
not
be
paid
for.
nine
million
dollars
worth
of
land
are
here
irretrievably
gone
unless
we
can
treat
them
as
void
and
somehow
recover
for
that
loss.
we
respectfully
submit
in
behalf
of
the
educational
institutions
of
our
state
that
this
is
an
invasion
of
a
public
trust
which
must
stop.
thank
you.
mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you
your
honor.
i
shall
be
brief.
i
would
like
to
relate
to
some
of
the
questions
which
were
asked
i
think
justice
fortas,
you,
mr.
chief
justice
asked
expressly
as
to
what
our
law
is
in
terms
of
what
would
happen
if
these
were
private
lands,
or
if
they
were
railroad
lands.
the
answer
has
been
forthrightly
and
candidly
put
by
mr.
lee.
if
that
were
happening,
the
doctrine
of
enhancement
would
not
apply
so
that
under
the
position
taken
by
the
highway
department
under
our
law
these
lands
are
put,
the
school
lands
are
put
in
a
position
inferior
to
the
railroad
lands
or
to
any
other
lands
because
under
our
expressed
statutes
and
categorical
decisions
there
would
be
no
such
enhancement
as
they
are
claiming
here.
we
have
covered
that
with
citations.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you'd
have
to
pay
for
it
your
honor
and
you
wouldn't
get
the
very
enhancement
which
they
are
claiming
here
by
expressed
provision,
we
have
set
forth
the
statute
in
the
interpretive
cases
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
4.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
have
not
mr.
chief
justice
made
that
the
primary
focus
of
our
argument
although
i
think
it
is
conclusive.
we
have
not
first
in
deference
to
the
other
eight
states
which
are
with
us
because
some
of
those
other
states
may
not
have
as
flat
as
statute
as
this.
and
secondly,
because
we
wish
to
nail
our
flag
to
and
stand
on
the
enabling
act,
the
question
which
i
put
when
i
sat
down
before
was
if
congress
wanted
to
require
that
you
get
the
appraised
value
for
every
acre,
how
could
congress
do
it
anymore
explicitly
than
it
has
been
done?
no
one
has
answered
that
question
because
you
can't
do
it
anymore
explicitly
than
that's
been
done
and
we
prefer
to
rest
on
that.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you
bet
and
when
it
applied
to
this
whole
section.
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
you
sir,
the
chief
justice
has
given
the
problem
of
checker
boarded
sections.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that's
right.
this
one
section
has
a
number.
that
precise
section
is
either
in
the
school
trust
or
it
isn't.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
answer
is
that
we
have
carried
this
traditionally
in
such
fashion
that
if
we
improve
these
lands,
we
do
them
out
of
the
general
funds.
we
would
not
deplete
the
school
trust
for
that
purpose
sir.
now,
do
i
miss
you
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes
and
our
position
on
the
score
your
honor
would
be
that
the
trust
lands
if
they
are
going
to
be
sold
after
improvement
but
nonetheless
require
payment
for
the
totality
of
them
and
there
isn't
any
system
under
this
act
whereby
you
can
ship
away
some
acres.
mr.
john
p.
frank
not
your
honor
when
they
designate
but
when
they
dispose
of.
the
statute
says
use
or
dispose
of.
now,
if
they
are
neither
using
nor
disposing
nor
selling,
that
would
be
another
thing
but
if
there
is
a
use
and
may
i
now
intervene
with
you
sir.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
must
be
paid
for
and
it
is
our
position
you
gave
your
honor
the
example
of
the
golf
course
when
you
say
that
one
part
of
a
golf
course,
one
section
to
develop
and
improve
the
area
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
the
answer
is
that
that
was
exactly
what
happened
in
the
town
of
benson
when
a
section
was
taken.
and
precisely
that
part
and
people
went
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
they
said
please
give
us
an
amendment
and
the
senate
committee
duly
recommended
it
on
the
ground
that
that
was
necessary
and
it
is
necessary
under
this
statute.
if
it
is
to
be
changed
it
must
be
by
amendment.
one
last
word
and
i
shall
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
pardon?
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
should
be
done,
your
honor.
congress
may
amend
the
enabling
act
which
it
then
accepted
as
an
amendment
in
arizona
as
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
would
amount
to
a
change
of
the
trust.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
congress
--
no.
congress
cannot
withdraw
it
unless
it
is
mutual.
but
if
there
were
mutual
agreement
and
this
has
been
done
your
honor,
there
have
been
amendments.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you
bet.
we
indeed,
we
do.
i
will
advert
in
closing
only
to
one
last
matter
and
that
is
the
argument
which
has
been
made
by
mr.
lee
that
non-enforcement
by
the
attorney
general
in
past
years
is
a
reason
why
the
act
evaporates
now
and
can't
be
enforced
anymore.
we
submit,
your
honor
that
the
act
is
not
so
fragile
that
it
is
erased
by
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
may
not
have
brought
an
action
earlier
from
this.
it
is
true
that
there
are
changing
circumstances
and
the
problem
does
become
larger
and
more
frightening
as
we
see
the
roads
taking
the
land
and
the
utility
standing
behind
it.
as
it
happens,
the
arizona
education
association
representing
the
teachers
who
are
concerned
not
for
now
because
this
doesn't
effect
now
but
for
the
future
of
the
state
have
seen
fit
to
press
this
matter
and
to
bring
it
here
to
protect
those
school
lands
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
has
been
a
public
service
on
their
part
and
that
they
are
not
part
in
pressing
that
argument
through
us
here
and
before
this
court
to
protect
these
trust
lands
whatever
the
course
of
ignoring
these
values
may
have
been
on
the
past.
thank
you.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
a
regulation
of
the
state
land
commissioner
of
arizona,
mr.
obed
lassen,
my
client
here
which
requires
that
certain
lands
granted
in
trust
to
the
state
of
arizona
by
the
federal
government
should
be
paid
for
if
they
are
to
be
taken
for
the
uses
which
i
am
going
to
discuss.
the
background
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are
interpreting
an
act
of
congress
passed
in
the
year
1910.
at
that
time,
there
was
pending
the
proposal
to
admit
the
47th
and
48th
states,
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
an
enabling
act
was
about
to
be
passed.
the
legislation
was
to
contain
as
in
the
typical
acts
for
the
admission
of
new
states
provisions
to
provide
public
lands
essentially
and
primarily
for
schools.
in
this
case,
it
was
contemplated
that
there
would
be
ten
and
a
half
million
acres
of
land
given
to
the
state
of
arizona
and
a
similar
amount
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
be
held
in
trust
for
this
purpose.
but
there
had
been
a
background
in
what
was
then
the
territory
of
new
mexico
which
disturbed
the
congress
very
much.
there
had
been
what
were
known
as
the
tall
timber
cases
in
which
the
practice
had
a
reason
of
despoiling
public
lands
in
new
mexico
by
the
devise
of
purporting
to
sell
lands,
having
them
stripped
off
their
mineral
or
timber
to
assets
and
then
giving
them
back
to
the
state
again
and
so
as
against
this
background
in
this
act,
the
congress
wished
to
be
particularly
careful
and
so
it
was
and
it
provided
not
only
as
had
been
the
tradition
in
other
acts
that
the
proceeds
of
public
lands
should
be
held
in
trust.
the
congress
also
provided
in
this
joint
act
for
the
two
states
that
the
very
lands
themselves
should
be
held
in
trust
and
it
provided
further
that
those
lands
could
never
be
disposed
of
except
by
the
devise
of
public
auction
and
that
they
never
could
they
be
disposed
of
except
after
an
appraisal
which
would
determine
the
true
value
thereof.
there
was
a
minimum
offset
price
of
so
and
so
many
dollars
in
paper
but
beyond
that
it
was
provided
that
the
land
should
not
be
sold
or
leased
i
quote
the
statute
in
a
whole
or
in
part
except
to
the
highest
and
best
bidder.
and
if
was
further
provided
in
this
section
and
i
think
is
of
special
importance
that
all
lands,
leaseholds,
timber
and
other
products
should
be
appraised
of
their
true
value
and
no
sale
or
no
other
disposal
thereof
should
be
made
for
a
consideration
less
than
the
value
so
ascertained.
under
that
statute
then
the
lands
were
given
to
the
two
states
and
the
practical
experience
has
been
that
they
have
been
frugally
handled
to
the
great
benefit
of
education
in
both
of
these
states.
in
new
mexico,
which
has
a
keen
interest
here
because
as
your
honor
understands,
the
identical
statute
in
the
same
provisions
and
hence
we
are
joined
here
by
mr.
jordan,
assistant
attorney
general
from
new
mexico.
in
new
mexico
something
in
the
amount
of
40%
of
the
educational
funds
of
the
state
have
been
developed
from
these
lands
and
some
$200
million
has
been
held
in
trust.
in
our
own
state
we
have
taken
a
more
conservative
approach
to
the
use
of
the
lands
of
the
lands
and
we
still
have
nine
and
a
half
million
of
the
ten
and
a
half
million
acres
in
the
trust
and
the
proceeds
of
the
remainder
are
held
in
a
permanent
school
fund
and
are
used
for
the
purposes
of
developing
education
in
arizona.
these
lands
as
enormous
ten
million
acre
track
i
must
make
clear
is
scattered
throughout
the
state.
we're
not
talking
about
a
sector
or
part
of
a
reservation.
it's
rather
a
checker
boarding
of
the
whole
state
to
establish
the
public
lands.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
these
are
(voice
overlap).
for
the
most
part
except
as
they
may
be
subject
to
grazing
or
very
short
term
leases
are
simply
held
that's
part
of
our
vast
acreage,
your
honor,
is
perhaps
aware
that
in
our
state
there
were
80%
of
the
total
land
of
the
state
as
public
land
of
one
sort
or
another.
this
is
a
relatively
small
patch
of
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
these
are
non-income
producing
lands
being
held
for
use,
a
million
acres
has
been
disposed
of
in
a
fashion
which
i
have
described.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
your
honor.
i
have
said
that
these
lands
were
put
in
trust
and
i
have
emphasized
that
because
it
dramatizes
the
extraordinary
care
congress
took
in
this
case
but
functionally
it's
all
the
same.
and
that's
why
eight
states
have
joined
us
in
our
position
here
today
and
why
we
are
generally
supported
by
all
of
the
states
because
what
has
happened
in
arizona
is
a
peculiar
localism
unique
to
that
one
area
but
one
which
creates
a
precedent
which
at
this
period
will
prejudice
all
the
public
stands
of
the
western
states.
to
be
precise,
as
to
what
has
happened.
a
question
when
lands
are
to
be
used
for
highways.
and
lands
are
to
be
used
for
highways
and
for
transportation
or
for
some
such
purpose
and
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
why
i
used
that
broad
term.
they
must
be
paid
for
and
when
the
lands
are
taken
for
example
to
put
in
a
road
or
a
utility
line
or
something
of
this
sort,
do
the
provisions
of
the
trust
law
which
provided
all
of
the
lands
without
exception
shall
be
paid
for
in
the
minimum
value
do
they
apply
or
is
there
some
reason
for
making
an
exception
and
not
making
a
charge
for
those
purposes.
what
has
happened
in
our
own
state
is
i
think
a
product
of
the
peculiar
road
building
background
there.
we
are
in
a
state
which
is
one
has
developed
relatively
recently
and
in
the
earlier
periods,
local
and
county
roads
consisted
as
some
of
you
has
seen
there
a
little
more
than
running
out
of
a
drag
device
across
the
desert
than
sending
a
car
long
after.
there
were
decisions
in
our
state
and
only
in
our
state
with
an
exception
i
shall
mention
in
the
40s
holding
that
those
did
not
need
to
be
paid
for
under
the
enabling
act.
the
situation
has
no
radically
changed
because
the
roads
become
gigantic
boulevard
in
interstate
highways
and
we're
talking
about
enormous
quantities
of
land.
and
in
these
circumstances,
the
land
commissioner
of
arizona
who
is
the
trustee,
mr.
lassen,
issued
a
regulation
and
this
regulation
provided
that
lands
to
be
taken
for
highway
purposes
should
be
appraised
and
could
be
made
available
for
this
purpose
but
only
at
their
true
value
after
appraisal.
now,
at
that
point,
the
highway
department
of
the
state
instituted
this
action.
and
this
action
is
a
suit
in
the
nature
under
our
practice
of
a
written
provision
brought
by
the
highway
department
against
the
land
department
to
prohibit
it
from
enforcing
that
regulation.
the
matter
was
presented
to
our
supreme
court
below,
and
the
problem
that
was
presented
there
is
also
a
problem
here
that
the
attorney
general
is
in
the
sense
in
both
sides
because
he
represents
both
state
agencies.
this
is
perfectly
appropriate
under
our
practice.
it
is
i'm
surely
highly
undesirable
under
yours.
so
that
what
happened
there
was
is
a
practical
matter
that
the
representation
of
the
highway
department
was
placed
on
the
hands
of
the
firm
which
represents
a
major
utility.
a
reclamation
utility
which
wishes
i
am
sure
to
follow
along
and
put
its
lines
in
without
thing
for
them
to.
the
utility
appeared
in
support
of
the
highway
department
amicus
in
the
trial
court.
meanwhile
the
teachers
of
the
state
have
the
deepest
possible
interest
in
the
future
of
the
education
and
of
educational
lands
and
i
was
retained
especially
by
the
teachers
for
the
purpose
of
filing
an
amicus
brief
there
and
have
been
denominated
a
wholly
nominal
assistant
--
special
assistant
attorney
general
but
in
fact
representative
of
the
educational
interest
in
the
state
to
bring
the
matter
here.
now,
i
pause
with
those
details
to
make
clear
that
i
think
we
meet
the
standard
of
genuine
adversary
proceedings
and
it
is
adversary
indeed
but
i
felt
that
you
should
know
what
the
background
circumstances
of
the
representation
ought.
the
matter
as
they
say
came
before
our
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
court
in
a
lengthy
opinion
held
that
regardless
of
the
trust
language
the
lands
need
not
need
to
be
paid
for
and
thus
prohibited
the
use
of
the
land
department's
regulation
we
brought
them
out
of
here.
now,
what
is
it
that
is
the
decision
or
the
essence
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below?
what
it
comes
to
is
this.
well,
it's
a
lengthy
opinion
it
can
boil
down
to
only
a
couple
of
sentences
and
those
are
set
forth
and
i'll
simply
mention
them
because
you'll
then
have
in
the
nutshell
exactly
what
the
decision
was
in
the
controversy
is.
the
court
below
said
that
these
lands
need
not
be
paid
for
and
that
the
enabling
act
and
that
these
provisions
which
i
have
read
here
need
not
be
observed.
first,
because
and
i
quote
"the
respective
right
of
way
for
these
highways
takes
less
than
a
fee
estate".
in
other
words,
they
said,
this
is
only
taking
an
easement
and
when
you
take
an
easement
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
it.
second,
the
court
below
said
the
trust
and
its
beneficiaries
the
school
lands
are
not
deprived
of
anything
of
value.
it
is
well
known
that
good
highways
throughout
the
state
increase
the
value
of
the
lands.
in
other
words,
the
court
below
reached
its
results
under
two
grounds,
(a)
that
this
is
a
taking
of
an
easement
and
that
therefore
that's
free
and
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
it.
and
on
the
ground
(b)
that
the
school
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
far
from
it
your
honor.
it
is
not
only
natural
but
let
me
direct
myself
to
that
because
nobody
seriously
supports
that
position
of
our
supreme
court
here.
the
government
has
not
said
a
word
in
behalf
of
us
and
neither
has
the
other
side.
now,
in
the
first
place
your
honor,
while
it
may
be
true
or
not
that
taking
an
easement
is
that
the
taking
of
roads
for
our
purposes
is
a
matter
of
taking
an
easement.
this
is
immaterial
and
frankly
non-rational
for
two
reasons.
first,
clearly
from
every
practical
standpoint
only
in
interstate
highway
across
the
land
of
the
state
of
arizona
with
tons
of
concrete
on
the
ground
is
in
every
functional
sense
identical
to
taking
a
fee
that
makes
any
difference.
but
secondly
and
the
reason
why
this
becomes
immaterial
and
i
shall
not
mention
it
again
and
i
am
sure
you'll
hear
no
more
of
it
from
the
other
side,
is
that
the
statute
clearly
is
the
--
i
am
speaking
of
the
enabling
act.
the
enabling
act
isn't
restricted
to
the
taking
of
fee
interest.
the
enabling
act
says
that
there
must
be
payment
in
full
at
the
appraised
value
for
the
--
for
any,
it
uses
that
broad
term
for
any
disposition
of
the
lands
and
on
top
of
that
it
nails
it
down
your
honor
by
saying
that
there
must
be
taking
in
full
for
the
use
of
the
lands
so
that
regarding
the
easement
as
regarding
this
as
an
easement
if
it
is
and
it
clearly
from
the
functional
standpoint
would
be
almost
absurd
the
use
of
property
concepts
but
regarding
at
as
such
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
the
statute
says
that
whether
you
take
this
position
any
disposition
what
you
take
the
use
of
is
immaterial.
so
the
matter
comes
to
the
remaining
elements
of
the
case
and
that
remaining
element
of
the
case
what
the
court
below
has
said
here
in
essence
that
it
had
--
i
mean
to
judge
you
by
it
but
it
is
similar
to
the
--
what's
good
for
general
motors
is
good
for
the
country
approach.
what
the
court
below
is
saying
is
roads
are
good
for
the
state,
what's
good
for
the
state
is
good
for
the
school
lands.
this
will
increase
the
value
of
the
school
lands;
therefore
you
don't
need
to
pay
for
it.
what's
for
the
general
good
is
sufficient
and
there
need
not
be
dollars
in
hand
paid,
that's
the
essence
of
the
decision
below
and
it's
the
essence
of
what
has
been
the
peculiar
arizona
position
on
this
subject.
now,
in
the
first
place
your
honor,
allow
to
devote
myself
to
that
subject
for
the
balance
of
my
argument.
we
begin
number
one
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
we
begin
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
expressly
in
the
clearest
possible
way
says
that
lands
are
to
be
paid
for.
it
does
not
permit
of
the
so-called
doctrine
of
enhancement.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
land
shall
be
valued
and
that
there
should
be
credited
against
the
value
whatever
plus
that
there
may
be
thought
become
as
a
result
of
the
taking
but
nothing
like
that
is
in
this
law
at
all.
instead
it
does
in
the
most
expressed
possible
way
put
certain
statutory
minimum
and
then
in
the
most
exact
possible
way
says
that
there
should
be
an
appraisal
and
there
should
be
no
sale
of
any
lands
or
disposition
of
any
lands,
any
taking
for
any
use
of
any
land
except
of
that
level
of
value.
now,
i
have
begun
by
saying
that
this
was
a
statute
which
have
had
very
close
congressional
attention
particularly
because
of
the
background
of
land
scandals
against
which
it
was
passed.
and
this
is
so
your
honors,
they
--
we
have
set
forth
a
good
deal
of
the
legislative
histories
in
our
briefs
and
i
won't
give
you
more
than
the
flavor
of
it
here.
but
i
wish
to
note
that
these
particular
restrictions
were
added
in
their
final
forum
by
the
senate
committee
after
full
hearings
and
that
the
report
show
great
emphasis
on
what
the
statute
says
so
that
the
senate
report
says
that
these
lands
shall
be
held
in
trust
to
be
disposed
of
only
as
therein
provided
and
the
question
was
expressly
considered
before
one
of
the
congressional
committees
are
these
restrictions
too
heavy?
are
they
severe,
can
you
live
with
these?
it
is
alright?
and
the
representative
of
arizona
appearing
before
the
committee,
appearing
in
behalf
of
the
territory
in
asking
for
statehood
said
that
when
asked
about
these
careful
restrictions
based
on
the
lands
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
question
he
said
i
believe
the
restrictions
on
such
public
lands
cannot
be
made
too
broad.
in
other
words,
the
territory
in
asking
for
statehood
was
welcoming
the
very
kind
of
provisions
which
in
fact
were
put
into
this
law
and
the
report
of
the
interior
department
shows
that
in
--
as
a
result
of
the
very
investigation
that
have
been
made
of
land
frauds,
these
provisions
saying
you
can
only
take
it
this
way,
you
can
only
price
it
this
way
had
been
put
in.
the
final
report
of
the
senate
committee
began
and
i
give
you
this
as
indication
of
the
tremendous
earnestness
of
which
the
committee
approach
the
problem
began
your
committee
cannot
too
earnestly
call
attention
to
the
extreme
care
that
should
be
taken
with
every
provision
of
a
bill
like
this
and
i
go
on
to
tell
that
but
they
were
particularly
meticulous
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
and
this
matter
of
legislation.
now,
what
has
happened
since?
we
have
had
not
merely
a
legislative
history
of
great
care.
we
have
had
a
subsequent
congressional
development
of
great
care
in
dealing
with
this
act.
because
this
act
is
of
course
subject
to
amendment
and
the
point
is
that
whenever
it
has
been
proposed
that
there
be
any
deviation
from
these
careful
pricing
terms
or
from
the
careful
disposition
terms
the
interested
parties
have
gone
back
to
congress
and
presented
the
matter
and
they
have
gotten
an
amendment
if
congress
wanted
to
give
it
and
because
this
trust
was
accepted
by
the
state
of
arizona
and
is
part
of
our
constitution,
this
may
require
an
amendment
to
our
state
constitution
as
well.
but
to
give
one
illustration
just
a
single
illustration
which
will
dramatize
it
i
think.
we
have
a
little
village
in
our
state
called
the
town
of
benson
and
the
town
of
benson
is
so
small
that
it
was
unable
when
it
wanted
a
section
of
land
just
that
small
amount
for
a
public
park
to
pay
the
$3.50
an
acre
amount
which
would
be
needed
even
for
that
600
acres.
they
simply
couldn't
afford
it.
we
are
talking
about
a
very
small
town.
and
therefore,
an
amendment
was
passed
through
the
congress
which
expressly
authorized
the
giving
of
a
section
of
land,
a
single
section
to
the
town
of
benson
without
compensation
and
the
legislative
history
expressly
shows
that
this
was
done
because
there
was
no
way
of
dedicating
that
one
section
for
a
public
use
except
by
paying
for
it
other
than
by
this
amendment
of
the
act.
now,
your
honors,
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
am
sure
no
one
did
then
when
the
sincere
truly
sincere
people
who
passed
that
act
passed
it
but
they
felt
that
the
giving
of
this
section
to
benson
would
improve
the
value
of
the
town
of
benson
and
improve
values
of
the
land
around
it
and
doubtlessly
the
giving
of
that
section
would
do
something
for
the
general
values
of
all
of
the
rest
of
the
school
line
of
the
region
or
the
state
or
whatever
but
the
point
is
that
it
was
not
supposed
that
the
piddling
amount
of
$2000.00
worth
of
land
could
be
disposed
of
without
compensation
except
by
an
act
of
congress
and
yet
under
the
arizona
decision
and
practice
from
which
we
appeal,
$9
million
worth
of
land
have
been
taken
from
this
school
trust
funds
already
and
are
irretrievably
gone
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
your
honor
and
that
only
says
that
the
--
not
only
that
the
constitution
says
so
but
the
enabling
act
says
so
that
any
transfer
is
null
and
void
and
whether
in
those
circumstances
mr.
lassen
will
be
able
to
bring
some
appropriate
action
to
try
to
recover
as
to
those
things
whether
it's
a
matter
of
policy
will
do
so
i
must
say
i
think
we
don't
know
whether
there
will
be
any
retrieval
because
this
practice
of
dribbling
away
our
trust
funds
has
been
going
on
for
20
years.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
must
say
in
candid
that
i
am
in
doubt
because
the
state
is
simply
not
considered
how
to
deal
with
this
problem
or
at
least
has
not
advice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
this
is
not
the
reason.
we
have
had
such
an
action.
it
is
clear
that
it
ought
to
arise
and
it
is
clear
that
the
trust
had
been
invaded
to
this
amount
but
i
cannot
with
a
responsibility
with
which
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question
state
what
would
happen
because
thoroughly
--
because
we're
dealing
really
with
the
public
land
law
of
all
of
the
states,
we
would
have
at
that
point
to
make
a
research
as
to
how
this
has
been
treated
elsewhere
and
i
am
sure
there
would
be
residents
on
the
point
with
some
of
the
jurisdictions
but
we
simply
don't
know.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well,
i
want
to
turn
to
that
your
honor
and
with
some
care,
as
to
the
eminent
domain
face
of
the
matter,
there
is
a
division
of
authority
on
that
and
with
your
permission
since
that
that
becomes
a
major
part
of
my
discussion
i
like
to
--
may
i
reserve
that
one
question
for
just
a
moment
mr.
justice?
have
i
met
your
point
at
the
best
of
my
ability
mr.
justice
fortas?
the
argument
which
is
made
here
then
by
the
other
side
is
that
enhancement
of
value
is
to
be
presumed
and
that
this
is
to
be
presumed
to
be
an
offset
so
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
for
the
lands
when
you
take
them,
whether
you
take
them
for
highway
purposes
or
for
utility
or
other
purposes
for
which
they
might
be
taken.
now,
there
is
this
difference
of
position
amongst
our
adversaries
and
i
identified
only
so
that
i
may
sharply
and
fairly
state
our
own
position.
the
position
of
our
adversaries
divides
in
this.
the
highway
department
as
you
will
shortly
hear
from
takes
the
position
as
the
court
below
did
that
one
must
always
presume
that
there
is
enough
value
created
by
a
road
so
you
never
have
to
pay.
you
should
be
thankful
that
a
piece
of
your
land
is
taken
under
the
road
is
put
upon.
the
position
of
the
federal
government
is
difficult.
the
land
division
takes
the
position
that
we
are
right
in
principle
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
should
be
reversed
but
that
in
some
instances,
it
will
turn
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
is
an
enhancement
of
value
as
a
result
of
the
road
and
that
therefore
there
need
be
no
compensation.
our
position
on
that
point
and
our
position
on
the
total
matter
is
this,
we
say
when
congress
established
this
trust
it
could
have
provided
for
an
enhancement
theory
of
valuation
if
it
wanted
to.
it
could
have
been
put
in
to
the
statute
a
provision
that
there
shall
be
credited
back
any
value
which
is
assumed
to
exist
as
a
result
of
the
disposition
of
the
land.
after
all
the
land
was
congress
says
to
give
away,
it
could
have
made
its
own
conditions
but
the
point
is
that
it
vary
clearly
didn't.
it
simply
didn't
see
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no
i
think
not
mr.
justice.
i'm
afraid
i
got
into
the
double
negative
here.
i
think
that
the
matter
needs
to
be
before
you
in
this
that
if
you
reject
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
if
you
adopt
our
position,
should
that
appeal
to
you
then
it
would
necessarily
follow
and
there
must
in
candor
now
just
as
the
government
position
falls
to
because
it
is
our
position
and
the
request
we
make
to
this
court
in
this
appeal
is
that
the
statute
is
to
be
enforced.
that
the
statute
provides
for
a
system
of
valuation,
this
regulation
provides
for
a
system
of
valuation.
this
regulation
which
we
are
asking
be
upheld
says
that
no
lands
may
be
disposed
of
except
that
they
appraise
value.
it's
taken
from
verbatim
from
the
statute
and
if
therefore
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
reversed
and
the
regulation
is
thereby
upheld
so
that
be
the
result
then
i
would
think
that
the
government
position
could
fall
with
it
so
that
i
am
compelled
to
say
that
that
question
is
so
interlock
here
that
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
separated
out
perhaps
by
ingenious
drafting
one
might
come
up
with
an
opinion
that
did
not
reach
that
matter
and
of
course
that's
all
is
possible.
but
i
believe
in
all
candor
it's
here,
mr.
lassen's
regulation
says
that
there
shall
be
an
appraisal
and
no
disposition
of
the
lands
except
that
the
appraised
value
in
every
and
does
not
provide
for
a
credit
in
case
of
some
incremental
value
as
this
assumes.
now,
the
matter
which
is
before
us
is
not
one
of
first
impression
on
this
court.
virtually
the
identical
question
has
been
before
you
previously
in
the
case
of
ervien
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself.
i
should
make
clear
that
the
various
states
have
also
dealt
with
this
subject
as
one
of
you
asked
me
earlier
is
this,
i
think
you
did
is
as
typical
of
the
other
land
states,
the
answer
is
yes.
this
question
crops
up
in
substantially
all
of
them.
there
is
one
case
and
one
only
in
the
country
which
is
against
our
present
position.
there
was
an
early
wyoming
case,
the
decision
of
ross
which
takes
essentially
the
view
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
what
you
have
before
you
a
brief
from
the
attorney
general
of
which
the
attorney
general
of
wyoming
has
joined
showing
that
that
is
not
in
fact
followed
in
that
jurisdiction.
and
the
whole
weight
of
the
state
cases
has
been
as
i
am
arguing
here
a
leading
example
is
the
case
of
walker
which
comes
from
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
there
was
thus
a
flat
conflict
just
directly
on
this
very
statute,
new
mexico
and
walker
having
decided
this
question
the
opposite
way
of
way
in
which
arizona
has
decided
but
apart
from
those
state
cases
which
are
adequately
discussed
in
the
brief,
apart
from
those
cases,
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ervien
which
is
a
matter
which
arose
from
new
mexico.
what
happened
there
was
this.
the
state
of
new
mexico
with
a
foreshadowing
of
this
exact
point
of
view
had
said,
a
good
advertising
program
for
our
state
is
just
what
we
need
and
it
will
increase
the
value
of
all
of
the
lands.
everybody
will
be
better
off
as
a
result
and
therefore
trust
funds
may
be
used
for
this
general
promotional
purpose
and
we
will
assume
that
there
will
be
a
sufficient
value
caused
by
those
--
that
advertising
program,
so
that
the
lands
will
gain
more
than
they
lose
by
this
disposition
of
the
funds.
now,
that
matter
was
put
into
issue
and
in
coming
into
issue
it
came
here
following
an
extensive
consideration
of
the
matter
in
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
the
almost
precise
point
was
considered
that
is
the
exact
highway
question
just
what
we're
talking
about,
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
is
it
would
be
but
a
step
further
to
argue
the
advantage
that
would
approve
to
the
trust
from
the
physical
construction
of
and
so
on
and
then
it
says
specifically
such
as
systems
of
public
highways.
in
other
words,
in
ervien
the
eighth
circuit
expressly
held
out
the
use
of
the
funds
for
public
highway
purposes
as
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
which
was
not
to
be
allowed.
this
court
adopted
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
you
had
a
short
opinion
of
your
own
but
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
is
expressly
incorporated
by
reference
here
and
this
court
said
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
these
words
to
preclude
any
license
of
construction
or
liberties
of
inference.
it
was
declared
that
the
disposition
of
any
of
the
land
for
any
purpose
other
than
that
provided
therein
would
be
deemed
to
breach
of
trust
and
this
court
said
the
dedication
we
repeat
was
"special
and
exact".
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
the
case
of
ervien,
your
honor,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
and
17
the
citation
here
is
251
u.s.41.
now,
your
honors
what
then
is
the
argument
that
is
made
for
the
other
side?
what
is
the
contention
which
is
before
us?
here
we
have
a
statute
that
in
so
many
words,
really
is
as
fairly
as
it's
possible
to
speak
english.
we
have
a
statute
which
in
so
many
words
says,
that
lands
must
be
paid
for
and
that
this
is
how
you
do
it
and
they
have
to
appraise.
the
argument
that
has
been
made
for
the
other
side
is
essentially
that
an
enabling
act
simply
doesn't
have
to
obeyed
that
strictly
but
the
states
are
entitled
to
take
a
latitudinarian
view
of
their
enabling
acts.
the
argument
is
made
essentially
and
it
is
based
almost
entirely
on
the
case
of
coyle
against
smith.
now,
that
was
the
case
involving
the
oklahoma
enabling
act
and
it
was
the
one
under
which
it
was
held
that
as
an
equal
footing
matter.
oklahoma
could
move
its
capital
from
one
place
to
another
regardless
of
the
provision
of
the
enabling
act.
this
was
on
the
grounds
of
equal
footing.
your
honors,
that
case
coyle
against
smith
far
from
being
authority
for
the
proposition
for
which
are
decided
happens
to
be
expressed
authority
going
the
other
way
because
the
movement
of
the
capital
was
held
to
be
a
matter
of
equal
footing
rights
but
this
court
in
that
case
expressly
said
that
this
would
not
apply
to
regulations,
i
am
quoting,
"touching
the
sole
care
and
disposition
of
the
public
lands
or
reservations
therein."
so
that
in
other
words,
coyle
against
smith
was
an
expressed
example
of
the
sort
of
thing
which
was
not
to
be
allowed.
i
will
turn
if
i
may
to
justice
white's
question
after
lunch.
mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
am
advised
by
my
associates
that
i
may
have
misled
an
answer
to
you.
you
asked
about
leasing
and
i
meant
to
say
and
i
think
i
did
that
the
revenues
were
not
substantial.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
lands
are
leased.
mr.
john
p.
frank
there
are
leases
but
they
don't
graze
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
now,
i
would
like
to
take
the
bulk
of
my
few
remaining
minutes
if
i
can
save
a
tiny
bit
i
shall
but
i
may
be
unable
to
answer
justice
white's
question
which
raises
the
one
i
think
really
have
a
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
justice
white,
the
question
arises
are
these
trust
lands
subject
to
eminent
domain
at
all?
the
answer
at
least
in
the
cases
is
this,
under
virtually
vertical
language
in
1903
idaho
decision
which
we've
discussed
fully
says
yes,
that
they
can
be,
that
they
are
subject
to
eminent
domain.
in
1910,
montana
decision
is
the
opposite.
it
rejected
the
idaho
decision
and
said
no.
our
act
was
passed
just
before
the
montana
decision.
in
1921,
congress
passed
the
statute
dealing
with
the
argument
raised
by
the
montana
decision
and
in
that
act
which
dealt
only
with
the
states
under
that
particular
enabling
act,
it
didn't
amend
the
law
generally,
congress
declined
to
take
a
position.
it
said
we
don't
have
to
decide
its
language
was
a
strict
and
perhaps
accurate
interpretation
of
the
acts
with
bar
eminent
domain
therefore,
in
order
to
remedy
this
situation,
we
expressly
allow
it
and
in
that
act
they
did.
now,
how
does
that
bear
in
that
situation?
what
our
land
commissioner
has
done
is
to
provide
that
all
land
must
go
by
appraisal
but
on
the
other
hand
under
this
regulation
he
does
not
require
that
it
be
sold
at
public
auction.
the
statute
says
it
must
be
sold
at
public
auction.
this
regulation
does
not
do
that.
it
does
not
because
the
appraisal
procedure
is
part
of
our
state
eminent
domain
procedure.
and
he
has
consciously
imported
the
imminent
domain
devise
following
the
idaho
decision
and
sought
to
use
it
on
the
theory
that
the
eminent
domain
procedures
can
be
applied
and
therefore
he
takes
the
appraisal
device
from
our
eminent
domain
law
but
does
not
require
the
option.
if
this
is
permitted
mr.
justice
white
it
is
implied
exception
under
the
theory
of
west
river
bridge
and
dix
that
all
acts
are
subject
to
the
eminent
domain
power.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
think
this
is
the
sound
review
when
we've
advanced
it
in
our
brief.
we
think
this
is
acceptable.
i
also
wish
to
make
clear
that
this
is
not
of
the
essence
of
our
position.
in
other
words,
we
could
perfectly
well
go
through
to
the
form
of
appearing
to
auction
off
a
50-mile
strip
of
a
thousand
feet
wide.
obviously,
there's
only
going
to
be
one
bidder
and
it
would
be
a
pure
ceremony.
but
that
can
be
done
and
while
it's
not
in
the
regulation,
we
haven't
the
faintest
objection
of
putting
it
there
if
this
court
feels
that
we
can
impart
eminent
domain
theory
into
this
case.
so,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it's
essentially
a
matter
of
indifference
but
i
do
report
that
the
problem
does
exist,
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
here
and
we
have
in
our
actual
conduct
attempted
to
apply
that
procedure.
now,
i
may
simply
say
this
in
conclusion
and
i
hope
i
am
saving
a
moment.
the
congress
has
given
10
million
acres
to
the
state
of
arizona.
it
did
pass
an
act
with
what
the
congressional
committee
report
shows
was
extreme
care
with
painstaking
care.
this
court
has
said
that
it
was
a
painstakingly
careful
act
about
your
own
language.
now,
let
me
simply
put
this
question
to
my
friends
who
are
next
to
me.
if
you
have
the
task
of
drafting
a
statute,
if
you
were
a
member
of
congress,
if
you
wanted
to
draft
an
act
which
would
provide
that
all
lands
that
were
taken
had
to
be
paid
for
in
appraised
value.
how
would
you
possibly
do
it
any
more
precisely
than
to
say
that
all
lands,
leaseholds,
timbers
and
other
products
before
bringing
offer
for
any
sale
or
other
disposal
shall
be
appraised
as
a
true
value
and
no
sale
shall
be
made
for
less
than
that
amount.
i
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
the
english
language
to
be
more
exact,
more
precise,
more
specific
than
this
and
i
leave
my
adversaries
with
a
question
suppose
the
congress
of
the
united
states
didn't
want
to
do
exactly
what
we're
saying
it
did
here.
how
could
it
conceivably
have
done
a
better
job
than
it
has
been
done
in
this
case
in
this
very
case?
our
state
stands
alone
in
this
country
and
taking
the
view,
the
trust
lands
can
be
taken
and
not
be
paid
for.
nine
million
dollars
worth
of
land
are
here
irretrievably
gone
unless
we
can
treat
them
as
void
and
somehow
recover
for
that
loss.
we
respectfully
submit
in
behalf
of
the
educational
institutions
of
our
state
that
this
is
an
invasion
of
a
public
trust
which
must
stop.
thank
you.
mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you
your
honor.
i
shall
be
brief.
i
would
like
to
relate
to
some
of
the
questions
which
were
asked
i
think
justice
fortas,
you,
mr.
chief
justice
asked
expressly
as
to
what
our
law
is
in
terms
of
what
would
happen
if
these
were
private
lands,
or
if
they
were
railroad
lands.
the
answer
has
been
forthrightly
and
candidly
put
by
mr.
lee.
if
that
were
happening,
the
doctrine
of
enhancement
would
not
apply
so
that
under
the
position
taken
by
the
highway
department
under
our
law
these
lands
are
put,
the
school
lands
are
put
in
a
position
inferior
to
the
railroad
lands
or
to
any
other
lands
because
under
our
expressed
statutes
and
categorical
decisions
there
would
be
no
such
enhancement
as
they
are
claiming
here.
we
have
covered
that
with
citations.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you'd
have
to
pay
for
it
your
honor
and
you
wouldn't
get
the
very
enhancement
which
they
are
claiming
here
by
expressed
provision,
we
have
set
forth
the
statute
in
the
interpretive
cases
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
4.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
have
not
mr.
chief
justice
made
that
the
primary
focus
of
our
argument
although
i
think
it
is
conclusive.
we
have
not
first
in
deference
to
the
other
eight
states
which
are
with
us
because
some
of
those
other
states
may
not
have
as
flat
as
statute
as
this.
and
secondly,
because
we
wish
to
nail
our
flag
to
and
stand
on
the
enabling
act,
the
question
which
i
put
when
i
sat
down
before
was
if
congress
wanted
to
require
that
you
get
the
appraised
value
for
every
acre,
how
could
congress
do
it
anymore
explicitly
than
it
has
been
done?
no
one
has
answered
that
question
because
you
can't
do
it
anymore
explicitly
than
that's
been
done
and
we
prefer
to
rest
on
that.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you
bet
and
when
it
applied
to
this
whole
section.
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
you
sir,
the
chief
justice
has
given
the
problem
of
checker
boarded
sections.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that's
right.
this
one
section
has
a
number.
that
precise
section
is
either
in
the
school
trust
or
it
isn't.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
answer
is
that
we
have
carried
this
traditionally
in
such
fashion
that
if
we
improve
these
lands,
we
do
them
out
of
the
general
funds.
we
would
not
deplete
the
school
trust
for
that
purpose
sir.
now,
do
i
miss
you
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes
and
our
position
on
the
score
your
honor
would
be
that
the
trust
lands
if
they
are
going
to
be
sold
after
improvement
but
nonetheless
require
payment
for
the
totality
of
them
and
there
isn't
any
system
under
this
act
whereby
you
can
ship
away
some
acres.
mr.
john
p.
frank
not
your
honor
when
they
designate
but
when
they
dispose
of.
the
statute
says
use
or
dispose
of.
now,
if
they
are
neither
using
nor
disposing
nor
selling,
that
would
be
another
thing
but
if
there
is
a
use
and
may
i
now
intervene
with
you
sir.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
must
be
paid
for
and
it
is
our
position
you
gave
your
honor
the
example
of
the
golf
course
when
you
say
that
one
part
of
a
golf
course,
one
section
to
develop
and
improve
the
area
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
the
answer
is
that
that
was
exactly
what
happened
in
the
town
of
benson
when
a
section
was
taken.
and
precisely
that
part
and
people
went
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
they
said
please
give
us
an
amendment
and
the
senate
committee
duly
recommended
it
on
the
ground
that
that
was
necessary
and
it
is
necessary
under
this
statute.
if
it
is
to
be
changed
it
must
be
by
amendment.
one
last
word
and
i
shall
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
pardon?
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
should
be
done,
your
honor.
congress
may
amend
the
enabling
act
which
it
then
accepted
as
an
amendment
in
arizona
as
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
would
amount
to
a
change
of
the
trust.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
congress
--
no.
congress
cannot
withdraw
it
unless
it
is
mutual.
but
if
there
were
mutual
agreement
and
this
has
been
done
your
honor,
there
have
been
amendments.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you
bet.
we
indeed,
we
do.
i
will
advert
in
closing
only
to
one
last
matter
and
that
is
the
argument
which
has
been
made
by
mr.
lee
that
non-enforcement
by
the
attorney
general
in
past
years
is
a
reason
why
the
act
evaporates
now
and
can't
be
enforced
anymore.
we
submit,
your
honor
that
the
act
is
not
so
fragile
that
it
is
erased
by
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
may
not
have
brought
an
action
earlier
from
this.
it
is
true
that
there
are
changing
circumstances
and
the
problem
does
become
larger
and
more
frightening
as
we
see
the
roads
taking
the
land
and
the
utility
standing
behind
it.
as
it
happens,
the
arizona
education
association
representing
the
teachers
who
are
concerned
not
for
now
because
this
doesn't
effect
now
but
for
the
future
of
the
state
have
seen
fit
to
press
this
matter
and
to
bring
it
here
to
protect
those
school
lands
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
has
been
a
public
service
on
their
part
and
that
they
are
not
part
in
pressing
that
argument
through
us
here
and
before
this
court
to
protect
these
trust
lands
whatever
the
course
of
ignoring
these
values
may
have
been
on
the
past.
thank
you.
