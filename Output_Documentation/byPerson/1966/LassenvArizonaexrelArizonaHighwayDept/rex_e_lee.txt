mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
basic
issues
in
this
case
which
we
feel
subsume
all
of
the
other
issues
and
i
feel
that
my
argument
could
be
most
helpful
if
developed
in
the
context
of
these
two
issues.
the
first
one
is
whether
net
value
enhancement
is
relevant
at
all.
that
is
in
developing
a
principle
of
compensation
to
the
trust
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
the
trust,
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
take
into
consideration
the
total
impact
upon
the
value
of
the
trust
of
highway
construction
to
all
lands
are
most
must
focus
narrowly
only
on
the
particular
parcel
that
is
taken.
on
this
issue,
the
united
states
and
the
respondent
are
in
agreement.
the
second
issue
is
that
assuming
that
net
value
enhancement
is
that
the
net
value
enhancement
is
a
permissible
consideration
for
the
state
taking
the
consideration.
how
do
you
go
about
showing
whether
in
fact
the
net
benefit
of
the
mere
fact
of
highway
construction
across
the
trust
lands
has
been
to
benefit
or
to
derogate
from
the
value
of
these
lands
is
on
this
issue
that
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
are
in
disagreement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
have
never
contended
at
any
point
in
this
litigation
that
the
total
value
of
the
trust
after
the
construction
of
highways
can
be
lesser
than
it
was
before
the
construction
of
highways.
that
is
the
net
benefits
attributable
and
directly
attributable
to
the
highway
construction
which
is
only
to
remaining
surrounding
trust
lands
must
be
at
least
increase
in
value
to
the
value
to
the
value
of
the
land
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
says
nothing
about
eminent
domain.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
second
place,
what
we
are
talking
about,
we
may
borrow
on
the
principles
to
a
certain
extent
and
in
eminent
domain
there
are
as
i
understand
it
two
different
rules.
one
is
that
you
can
offset
value
to
remaining
lands
belonging
to
the
condemnee
against
the
value
of
the
interest
taken.
the
rule
in
arizona
happens
to
be
different
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
this,
the
rule
in
arizona,
a.r.s.section
12-1122
is
that
you
can't
offset
benefit
to
remaining
trust
lands
only
against
the
severance
damages
that
is
the
amount
that
you
damage
those
remaining
trust
lands
and
not
against
the
value.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
contend
not
simply
because
we
contend
that
it
is
not
eminent
domain
that
is
the
applicable
rule.
i'll
develop
this
more
completely
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
we
contend
that
the
state
of
arizona
could
have
had
it
solely
elected
adopted
this
principle
of
eminent
domain
but
what
we
are
dealing
here
with
is
three
essential
provisions
in
our
view,
provisions
that
appear
in
section
28
of
the
enabling
act.
mr.
frank
has
referred
to
two
of
these
and
i
will
advert
to
them
in
a
moment
briefly
for
that
reason
but
first
is
the
public
auction
provisions.
mr.
frank
has
stated
there
is
a
blanket
provision
that
permits
of
no
exception
which
states
that
these
lands
must
be
disposed
of
by
public
auction
which
you
have
to
give
notice
of
that
public
auction
for
ten
weeks
once
each
week
for
a
period
of
10
weeks
in
two
different
newspapers.
the
second
provision
that
is
relevant
and
this
of
course
mr.
justice
fortas
is
particularly
going
to
bear
down
that
all
of
the
interest
shall
be
appraised
and
that
no
sale
or
other
disposal
thereof
shall
be
made
for
a
consideration
less
than
the
value
so
ascertained
and
finally
the
provision
that
has
not
been
yet
mentioned
this
day
but
a
provision
which
is
of
extreme
importance
is
the
catch
all
provision
that
comes
at
the
end
of
section
28
the
one
dealing
with
these
trust
land
provisions
and
says
this.
i
am
reading
from
the
appendix,
the
petitioner's
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
39,
"every
sale,
lease,
conveyance
or
contract
of
or
concerning
any
of
the
lands
hereby
granted
or
confirmed
or
the
use
thereof
or
the
national
products
thereof
not
made
in
substantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
null
and
void."
and
i'd
like
to
consider
first
as
a
background
to
the
value
provision
because
i
think
it
sheds
light
on
it
the
applicability
of
these
public
auction
provisions.
the
great
significance
of
this
pubic
auction
provision
is
that
they
don't
apply
to
use
this
for
highway
purposes.
every
governmental
agency
that
had
addressed
itself
to
this
problem
has
agreed
on
this
point
that
you
don't
have
to
submit
highways
which
are
--
lands
which
are
going
to
be
used
for
highway
purposes
to
these
public
auction
provisions
notice
for
over
a
period
of
10
weeks
and
so
forth.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
reason
is
obvious,
we're
dealing
here
with
strips
of
land
that
are
100
feet
wide,
a
mile
long,
and
bounded
on
each
end
by
a
proposed
highway.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
know
that
it
is
going
to
be
interested
in
bidding
on
those
--
on
the
strips,
on
the
long
narrow
strips
of
land
except
the
highway
department
and
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
at
all.
not
at
all
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
have
a
practical
reason
and
a
legal
reason
mr.
justice
white
and
this
is
the
practical
reason.
and
the
legal
reason
is
this
that
the
obvious
inappropriateness
of
these
public
auction
provisions
to
uses
for
highway
purposes
points
out
the
central
fact
that
when
congress
enacted
this
particular
provision
of
the
enabling
act,
it
did
not
have
in
mind
public
uses
in
general
and
particularly
uses
for
highway
practices.
as
mr.
frank
has
pointed
out
this
morning,
the
dominant
consideration
underlying
congress'
enactment
of
this
enabling
act
was
to
prevent
the
sale
of
these
lands
to
private
proprietors.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
alright.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
here
is
my
answer,
here
is
my
answer,
--
let
me
answer
it
in
two
steps.
i
first
of
all
say
its
obvious
inappropriateness
to
the
highway
context
is
saved
by
the
interaction
of
two
facts.
number
one,
the
fact
of
congress
obviously
did
not
consider
this
particular
problem.
and
number
two,
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
deal
with
this
specific
face
of
the
problem
it
did
deal
with
it
as
a
generic
type
by
this
substantial
conformity
clause.
therefore
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
in
all
fairness,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
overall
purpose
of
this
value
provision
is
this
that
this
is
the
basic
concept
underlying
a
value
provision.
the
state
has
given
a
basic
package
of
lands.
two
things,
any
proceeds
that
come
from
the
sale
of
those
lands
has
to
be
used
for
school
purposes.
there
is
no
other
permissible
---
mr.
rex
e.
lee
conceivably
so
but
this
is
not
the
only
restriction.
there
is
in
our
view
an
additional
restriction
and
that
is
the
one
that
is
imposed
by
this
value
provision.
that
the
--
the
state
was
given
a
basic
package
of
lands
until
those
lands
were
converted
into
cash.
once
they
were
converted
into
cash
the
cash
could
only
be
used
for
certain
purposes.
until
they
were
converted
into
cash,
the
state
had
an
additional
obligation
on
it
and
that
is
that
it
was
charged
to
an
obligation
of
seeing
to
it
that
the
total
value,
the
total
value
of
this
package
was
not
diminished.
now
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
it's
also
implicit
in
this
paragraph
which
says
that
these
shall
not
be
disposed
of
except
for
value
though
the
language
has
not
expressly
written
in
that
regard.
this
--
congress
set
forth
certain
general
restrictions
and
certain
general
principles,
manifestly
congress
could
not
in
1910
foresee
all
of
the
problems
that
are
going
to
occur.
a
case
in
point
did
not
foresee
that
problem.
now
i
will
get
into
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
congress
did
provide,
congress
did
recognize
that
it
couldn't
foresee
all
the
problems
and
therefore
it
provided
that
substantial
conformity
was
to
be
the
applicable
rule
within
the
state
of
arizona.
therefore,
the
obligation
which
is
imposed
upon
the
state
is
and
i
think
it
is
at
this
point
the
reasoning
of
the
government's
brief
is
particularly
helpful.
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
that
there
is
no
precise
blueprint
detailing
the
exact
nature
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
state
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
determined
by
the
general
principle
of
the
general
purposes
of
the
act
and
that
so
long
as
the
overall
value
of
the
trust
is
maintained
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
use
these
lands
for
public
purposes.
so
long
as
it's
in
substantial
conformity
for
the
purpose
of
the
act.
now,
is
it
we
submit
that
it
is
for
various
reasons
that
have
discussed
in
our
brief
i'd
like
to
mention
just
very
briefly
two
of
them.
one
is
that
this
is
not
a
noble
decision
and
the
only
one
of
its
kind
in
the
country.
mr.
frank
recognized
the
opinion
of
the
wyoming
supreme
court.
though
not
dealing
with
enabling
acts
there
are
other
states
for
example
new
jersey
which
in
the
constitution
has
certain
restrictions
placed
on
certain
kinds
of
lands.
we
have
cited
about
five
or
six
cases
in
our
briefs
dealing
with
those
type
of
constitutional
provisions
which
dignity
wise
are
of
a
simple
--
similar
type
of
dignity
of
this
enabling
act
and
various
different
states
have
held
that
in
these
lands
may
be
used
for
highway
construction
purposes
if
the
offsetting
value
increment
to
remaining
trust
land
is
at
least
equal
to
the
value
of
the
lands
taken
for
these
purposes
but
the
point
on
which
i
would
like
to
bear
down
particularly
is
the
point
that
arizona
is
entitled
to
interpret
value
as
meaning
value
to
each
of
the
trust
lands
and
not
just
value
to
the
lands
taken
for
the
reason
that
is
the
position
has
been
taken
by
the
united
states
attorney
general
over
a
period
of
50
years.
this
interpretation
is
significant
not
only
because
of
its
intrinsic
persuasiveness
but
also
by
virtue
of
the
bare
fact
that
it
is
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
the
attorney
general.
the
enforcement
response
--
well,
the
act
does
leave
it,
it
is
true
to
either
the
states
or
any
individual
the
right
to
enforce
the
provision
of
this
act
but
the
primary
responsibility,
the
first
line
of
defense
is
the
united
states
attorney
general.
there's
of
course
a
familiar
doctrine
that
interpretation
placed
upon
the
federal
statute
by
the
agency
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
that
statute
are
entitled
to
particular
weight
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out
for
the
court
in
udall
versus
tallman,
it
need
not
necessarily
be
the
only
interpretation
which
the
act
might
permit
nor
need
it
be
the
interpretation
which
we
as
an
original
manner
might
have
adopted
had
the
case
originally
had
arisen
as
a
judicial
case
or
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
the
particularly
significant
thing
about
the
interpretation
of
the
justice
department
in
this
case
is
that
it
extends
over
a
period
of
more
than
50
years.
as
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
pointed
out
the
practice
that
is
presently
under
attack
is
of
some
50
years
standing
in
this
state
of
arizona.
during
all
of
that
50-year
period,
united
states
attorney
general
has
never
taken
any
action
to
have
this
practice
declared
invalid.
this
acquiescence
we
submit
has
not
been
through
inadvertence.
in
those
instances
in
which
practices
have
occurred
which
have
truly
derogated
from
the
value
of
the
trust
the
united
states
attorney
general
had
been
swept
for
act.
for
example,
in
this
tall
timber
cases
which
have
been
so
prominently
referred
to
involved
were
12
suits
which
were
brought
in
the
territorial
court
for
the
new
mexico
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
similarly
in
1915
when
the
state
of
new
mexico
enacted
an
act,
a
statute
providing
that
3%
of
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
all
these
lands
should
be
used
to
advertise
the
advantages
and
resources
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
generally,
the
attorney
general's
office
was
successful
in
having
the
statute
declared
invalid
as
repugnant
to
the
enabling
act
and
this
was
the
irving
litigation
which
eventually
terminated
in
this
court.
the
action
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
irving
case
was
swept
and
decisive.
the
new
mexico
act
was
passed
on
march
8,
1915
and
the
federal
district
court
action
was
instituted
by
the
attorney
general
less
than
five
months
later
on
august
7,
1915
yet
during
all
the
time
that
this
ervien
litigation
was
progressing,
the
very
practice
which
is
under
attack
here
was
in
effect
under
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
united
states
attorney
general's
office
made
no
look
to
take
any
corrective
action.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir,
it
was
not.
but
we
have
there
in
two
states
side
by
side
that
are
identical
enabling
act
provisions
practiced
by
one
was
attacked,
a
practice
by
one
was
not.
this
of
course
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
there
are
determinative
differences
between
the
two
practices
and
we
submit
that
there
are
for
two
reason.
the
first
is
that
that
which
the
united
states
suggested
indicated
earlier
that
the
basic
concept
of
these
value
provisions
of
the
trust
is
that
a
certain
package
of
trust
land
has
conveyed
to
the
state
with
a
thought
in
mind
that
one
day
it
will
be
converted
into
cash
and
these
cash
will
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
schools,
hospitals,
reformatories
and
so
forth.
once
the
funds,
once
these
lands
are
converted
into
cash,
they
remain
invaluable.
you
can't
use
them
for
any
other
purpose
and
that's
the
first
difference.
if
the
state
of
new
mexico
directly
used
the
funds
resulting
from
the
sale
of
the
lands
themselves,
that
is
not
the
problem
in
this
case.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
rather
whether
or
how
the
lands
which
one
day
will
be
disposed
of
and
converted
into
cash
are
to
be
maintained
or
to
have
their
integral
value
maintained
so
that
at
that
time
that
they
are
disposed
of
the
value
will
not
be
lesser
because
the
use
that
has
been
made
of
the
interim
period.
the
second
difference
is
this,
mr.
frank
had
referred
to
the
fact
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
cited
with
approval
by
mr.
justice
mckinney's
majority
opinion.
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
you
see,
that
the
real
problem
that
the
court
there
was
concerned
with
was
the
fact
that
these
trust
lands
comprised
only
126
of
the
total
area
of
the
state
and
yet
there
has
been
126
of
the
lands
were
being
made
to
bear
the
brunt
of
an
advertising
program
which
presumably
would
benefit
the
entire
state,
the
opinion
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
if
this
in
fact
were
the
case
mr.
justice
black
it
would
bother
me
too.
what
we
submit
is
that
of
course
these
lands
do
not
bear
the
entire
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
black
i
have
no
idea
how
many
acres
have
already
been
taken.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
let
me
make
two
statements
with
the
regard
to
that.
in
the
first
place
of
course,
these
parcels
were
mostly
located
in
the
section
side
parcels,
the
enabling
act
says
section
2,
16,
32
and
36
so
that
they
would
principally
be
in
section
one
mile
square
parcels.
and
the
road
of
course
would
come
through
other
land
come
up
through
these
school
lands
and
would
go
across
the
lands
the
interstate
would
say
some
102,
100
feet
wide.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
but
i
think
what
we
have
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
first
issue
is
that
also
benefits
the
surrounding
trust
lands.
now
whether
it
does
in
fact
or
whether
this
has
been
adequately
proven,
i
will
get
to
it
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
think
that
we
also
have
to
assume
this
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
all
kinds
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
very
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh
a
limited
access
highway
where
you
might
go
50
miles
before
you
get
to
an
exit.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
this
simply
points
out
the
problem
that
the
posture
of
this
case
is
not
proper
for
the
consideration
of
this
particular
issue.
but
that
is
we
don't
have
in
this
record
any
evidence
as
to
what
type
of
highways
and
roads
there
are
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
am
going
to
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
do
not
mean
by
that
the
court
below
was
wrong.
i
mean
that
by
the
virtue
that
of
the
way
the
case
came
to
the
court
it
had
no
other
alternative
but
to
do
as
it
did.
let
me
just
say
at
this
point.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
assure
you
mr.
justice
white
i
will
get
to
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
will
be
over
that
in
more
detail
in
a
moment.
let
me
say
that
but
because
of
our
concept
that
it's
the
total
impact
of
the
entire
trust,
we
would
say
that
would
be
both.
that
is
in
a
particular
instance
when
you
open
up
entirely
new
lands
if
you
run
a
highway
across
a
particular
section,
manifestly
it's
going
to
have
some
effect
in
that
section.
we
think
that
it
is
always
a
benefit.
also
if
it's
an
area
previously
undeveloped
as
much
of
arizona
certainly
is
and
mr.
frank
himself
has
pointed
out
that
much
of
these
lands
are
simply
non-income
producing
at
the
present
time
presumably
because
they
are
inaccessible
and
you
may
have
also
benefits
to
other
nearby
lands
in
other
sections.
but
just
briefly
with
regards
to
the
lack
of
a
record,
the
only
support
for
the
proposition
that
in
fact
there
has
been
40,000
acres
or
$9
million
or
whatever
it
is
if
the
fact
that
there
have
self
serving
conclusionary
and
totally
extra
record
assertions
of
fact
to
that
effect
made
in
the
proceedings,
made
in
the
proceedings
before
this
court.indeed
in
article
appearing
recently
in
the
arizona
republic
the
suggestion
is
made
that
these
facts
--
that
these
figures
are
incorrect.
manifestly
this
is
not
the
tribunal
in
which
that
particular
issue
should
be
resolved.
we
simply
point
out
and
i
will
go
into
this
more
fully
in
just
a
moment
that
because
of
the
posture
of
the
case
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
raise
--
the
issues
that
are
in
this
case
we
really
feel
that
probably
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted,
and
it
should
await
future
cases
which
the
record
is
proper.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
consider
the
added
value
to
all
the
school
lands.
we
think
that
this
is
consistent
with
viewing
the
impact
of
highway
construction
on
the
total
trust
on
the
total
land
which
is
our
basic
problem.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
distinction
is
this.
that
as
i
read
the
enabling
act,
there
was
quite
a
definite
purpose
to
place
severe
restrictions
rather
severe
restrictions
against
the
use
of
these
lands
for
private
purposes
except
under
these
restrictive
purposes
for
example
the
public
auction
and
so
forth.
because
of
what
i
regard
to
be
this
basic
purpose
of
the
trust
land
provisions
of
the
enabling
act
we
would
say
that
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
must
be
adhered
to
whenever
these
lands
are
used
for
private
purposes.
but
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
use
by
the
public
itself
for
the
purpose
of
construction
of
roads
then
this
is
an
apt
instance
for
application
of
what
congress
provided
would
be
the
governing
rule
that
only
those
transactions
not
in
substantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
could
be
proscribed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
i
have
an
answer
for
it.
and
the
answer
is
this.
when
congress
passed
this
enabling
act,
it
foresaw
certain
problems.
it
did
not
foresee
all
of
the
problems
and
it
recognized
that
it
didn't
foresee
all
of
the
problems.
one
of
these
problems
was
private
use.
another
was
use
by
reclamation
project.
because
congress
recognized
that
it
didn't
foresee
all
of
the
problems,
it
provided
a
catch
all
of
raising
saving
funds
at
the
end
that
only
those
transactions
not
in
substantial
conformity.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
agree
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
congress
did
provide
that
those
transactions
are
in
substantial
conformity.
i
refer
to
another
canon
of
statutory
interpretation
that
the
language
has
meaning
particularly
when
you
consider
where
are
these
particular
paragraph
comes.
section
28
is
the
basic
section
that
deals
with
these
trust
lands
provisions
and
right
at
the
end
of
section
28
and
presumably
an
all
embracing
provision
that
all
transactions
not
in
substantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
shall
be
null
and
void.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
of
course
is
not
my
point
mr.
chief
justice.
they
didn't
anticipate
the
need
for
public
roads.
what
they
didn't
anticipate
was
the
possible
conflict.
obviously,
it
was
not
anticipated.
and
the
possible
conflict
between
these
particular
provisions
dealing
with
public
auction
and
the
needs
which
might
arise
in
1966
say
for
example
as
to
the
need
for
an
immediate
taking
and
the
re-inimical
--
the
fact
that
it
would
be
clearly
inimical
to
the
state's
highway
construction
program
if
you
had
to
simply
wait
for
a
10-week
period
in
which
you
went
through
these
public
auction
notice
provisions
before
you
can
take
the
lands
and
use
them
for
highway
construction
purposes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
presumably
because
the
reclamation
projects
had
someone
who
had
a
good
lobby
there
and
anticipated
the
problem.
my
---
i
really
don't
know
--
i
really
don't
know.
all
i
know
is
that
we
do
have
the
language
of
the
statute
that
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
some
portions
of
the
statute
as
to
which
a
too
literal
application
would
result
in
an
unintended
consequence.
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
congress
did
provide
a
safety
valve
as
a
generic
type
against
the
possibility
of
a
too
literal
application
resulting
in
unintended
consequences
and
i
can
describe
no
other
reason
for
this
substantial
conformity
provision.
now
let
me
address
myself
just
very
briefly
to
the
question
of
assuming
that
the
net
value
enhancement
theory
is
an
acceptable
theory
upon
whom
does
the
burden
lie.
the
united
states
suggests
that
it
should
lie
with
the
highway
department
and
as
an
abstract
proposition
we
are
not
out
of
sympathy
with
this.
if
all
we
have
to
go
on
with
the
bare
pages
of
the
enabling
act
itself
on
the
day
following
its
enactment
but
we
would
disagree
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
on
three
different
occasions
determined
that
in
fact
the
constructions
of
highways
in
arizona
does
result
in
a
net
value
enhancement
to
trust
lands
and
this
gets
us
back
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
earlier
and
i
think
perhaps
i
can
anticipate
a
question
that
follows
it
and
that
is
was
this
not
an
arbitrary
decision?
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
in
the
first
place,
it's
difficult
to
fault
the
arizona
supreme
court
for
handling
this
case
the
way
it
did
because
of
the
posture
in
which
the
case
arose.
at
the
time
that
this
case
came
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
on
a
writ
of
provision,
there
were
already
outstanding
two
prior
decisions
of
that
court
holding
that
in
fact
the
construction
of
highways
across
these
trust
lands
resulted
in
a
net
benefit
not
to
lands
as
a
whole
but
to
the
trust
lands
themselves.
now
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
that
those
lands
that
are
being
in
between
justice
black
i
was
just
referring
to
other
school
lands.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
in
our
view
it's
not
a
matter
of
who
has
to
pay
how
much.
it's
a
matter
of
after
you
get
through
building
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
because
of
peculiar
arizona
rule
and
it
may
exist
in
other
instances.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
agree
with
you
but
on
the
other
hand
if
it
has
been
determined
by
a
competent
process
and
i'd
like
to
deal
just
briefly
with
what
is
a
competent
process.
if
it
has
been
determined
by
a
competent
process
that
in
fact
after
you
put
a
road
across
trust
lands,
take
a
given
stretch
of
roads
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
other
lands
that
trust
lands
considered
just
and
by
themselves
are
worth
more
by
virtue
of
the
bare
fact
that
that
road
has
been
constructed
in
the
process.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
may
be.
they
may
be
and
this
may
also
be
a
consideration
the
state
of
arizona
may
wish
to
take
into
consideration
there.
and
i
think
that
if
they
did
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
for
example
if
the
state
were
to
adopt
a
principle
of
compensation
to
--
as
to
private
lands.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
not.
some
states
do
but
the
state
of
arizona
in
normal
eminent
domain
procedure
only
allows
benefits
to
be
offset
against
what
we
call
severance
damages
and
not
against
the
damages
from
the
actual
taking.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
presume
it
would
be
so,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there's
nothing
in
this
on
the
record.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
federal
highway
program
mr.
justice
fortas
but
that
is
my
understanding
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
informed
by
my
co-counsel
who
spends
time,
full
time
in
highway
department
matters.
this
is
not
done.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.i
really
don't
know
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
record
as
to
what
the
procedure
is
and
i
am
really
not
familiar
with
the
procedure
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
pay
for
what,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
case
of
an
interstate
highway
then
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
act,
part
would
be
paid
by
the
federal
government
and
part
would
be
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
accord
of
whatever
the
percentage
would
be.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
are
cases
where
there
would
be
more
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
other
side
prevails
then
the
benefit
goes
to
the
trust.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
there
is
no
question
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
be
more
of
a
benefit
but
we
submit
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
if
a
value
--
if
actual
cash
has
to
be
paid
from
the
highway
department
to
the
land
department,
and
in
addition
to
that
they
get
the
value
increase
resulting
from
the
highway
construction
that
the
trust
will
be
greater
in
risk
but
we
submit
that
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
what
is
the
greatest
benefit
that
can
possibly
be,
that
can
possibly
be
obtained
for
this
reason
the
trust
--
the
trust
provisions
deal
in
terms
of
value
and
the
standard
as
we
see
it
is
that
value
must
be
maintained.
if
it
is
maintained,
then
the
state
may
deal
with
these
--
may
use
these
lands
for
highway
construction
purposes.
in
the
final
analysis,
it's
true
that
enabling
acts
are
federal
statutes,
but
many
of
the
provisions
of
these
enabling
acts
deal
particularly
with
problem
areas
which
substantively
are
within
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
state
itself.
for
example,
the
establishment
of
schools,
the
establishment
of
hospitals,
and
the
establishment
of
reformatories
lies
within
the
exclusive
responsibility
of
the
state
itself.
similarly,
the
setting
of
the
standards
according
to
which
these
institutions
are
to
be
maintained
is
an
exclusive
state
responsibility.
once
the
state
is
determined
and
you
can
set
the
standards,
the
state
can
set
the
standard
for
school
just
as
high
or
low,
or
just
it
wants
to.
if
it
sets
up
high,
that
means
that
more
money
is
going
to
be
required.
once
the
standard
has
been
set
to
whatever
extent
the
school
trust
funds
are
insufficient
to
pay
the
bill,
the
difference
is
going
to
have
to
be
made
up
by
the
state
itself
and
regardless
of
which
way
this
determination
has
made
as
to
whether
highway
department
funds
have
to
be
paid
to
the
state
department,
state
land
department
no
matter
on
what
circumstances,
the
eventual
bite
is
going
to
be
felt
by
the
state
itself
through
its
taxing
process.
all
we're
saying
is
this
that
in
working
out
its
overall
governmental
problems
of
providing
for
schools,
hospitals,
reformatories
and
highways,
all
of
which
are
state
responsibilities.
the
state
should
be
entitled
to
incorporate
into
its
total
governmental
scheme
that
interpretation
of
the
enabling
act
which
best
comports
with
its
total
scheme
and
which
it
fits
in
best
with
the
other
constituent
parts
of
that
scheme.
it
follows
then
that
if
the
state
of
new
mexico
wants
to
interpret
its
enabling
act
as
requiring
that
only
--
that
value
means
only
value
to
the
particular
lands
that
are
taken,
then
this
is
perfectly
within
the
right
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
do
so
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
state
of
arizona
must
adopt
a
similarly
restrictive
view.
we
submit
simply
as
to
the
issue
of
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
was
made
by
persons
who
are
familiar
with
arizona.
they
are
familiar
with
its
problems,
with
its
history
and
with
its
geography.
we
don't
know
what
considerations
they
took
into
account.
we
do
know
that
they
are
--
in
the
studies
made
in
the
state
of
texas
and
elsewhere
which
indicate
rather
forcefully,
rather
dramatically
that
highway
construction
across
even
developed
lands,
the
golf
freeway
in
houston
and
the
dallas
expressway
in
the
suburbs
of
dallas.it
illustrate
rather
dramatically
that
the
effect
of
construction
of
highways
across
lands
is
to
fantastically
increase
the
value
of
those
lands.
in
the
case
of
the
dallas
study,
the
increase
of
value
of
the
surrounding
lands
was
even
in
excess
of
the
cost
of
construction
of
the
highway
itself
and
we
don't
whether
the
members
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
took
these
particular
factors
into
consideration
or
not.
we
do
know
that
tourism
is
the
fourth
largest
industry
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we
know
that
historians
have
assigned
an
important
role
to
highways
in
the
development
of
the
state
interest
presumably
also
therefore
of
its
lands.
at
the
very
least,
these
decisions
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
are
entitled
to
some
weight
and
are
entitled
not
to
be
rejected
out
of
hand
as
though
they
never
existed
at
all.
at
the
very
least,
we
submit
they
are
entitled
to
sufficient
weight
to
shift
the
burden
to
those
who
would
contend
that
the
conclusions
reached
there
are
not
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
black,
if
we
are
correct
in
our
theory
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
equal
in
achieving
this
purpose
because
of
the
fact
that
a
dollar
increment
to
a
surrounding
land
is
just
as
effective
as
a
dollar
actually
paid
for
lands
that
are
taken
for
that
purpose.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
consider
the
total
impact
on
the
value
of
all
of
the
lands
taken
as
a
whole,
all
of
the
trust
lands.
we
offset
only
the
value
of
the
lands
taken
from
the
trust
against
the
value
increment
to
trust
lands
themselves
in
the
trust.
the
private
lands,
we
leave
out
of
them
entirely
because
the
private
lands
simply
don't
enter
into
it.
it's
the
trust
lands
that
we
take
into
consideration.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
it
it's
a
question
of
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
extent
that
it
is
a
matter
of
bookkeeping
mr.
justice
black
in
answer
to
your
question
then
i
would
contend
that
since
the
ultimate
burden
is
going
to
be
born
by
the
state
of
arizona,
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
incorporate
into
its
total
overall
scheme
that
interpretation
of
the
enabling
act
which
best
fits
within
its
overall
scheme
so
long
as
insubstantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
we
submit
this
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
basic
issues
in
this
case
which
we
feel
subsume
all
of
the
other
issues
and
i
feel
that
my
argument
could
be
most
helpful
if
developed
in
the
context
of
these
two
issues.
the
first
one
is
whether
net
value
enhancement
is
relevant
at
all.
that
is
in
developing
a
principle
of
compensation
to
the
trust
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
the
trust,
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
take
into
consideration
the
total
impact
upon
the
value
of
the
trust
of
highway
construction
to
all
lands
are
most
must
focus
narrowly
only
on
the
particular
parcel
that
is
taken.
on
this
issue,
the
united
states
and
the
respondent
are
in
agreement.
the
second
issue
is
that
assuming
that
net
value
enhancement
is
that
the
net
value
enhancement
is
a
permissible
consideration
for
the
state
taking
the
consideration.
how
do
you
go
about
showing
whether
in
fact
the
net
benefit
of
the
mere
fact
of
highway
construction
across
the
trust
lands
has
been
to
benefit
or
to
derogate
from
the
value
of
these
lands
is
on
this
issue
that
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
are
in
disagreement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
have
never
contended
at
any
point
in
this
litigation
that
the
total
value
of
the
trust
after
the
construction
of
highways
can
be
lesser
than
it
was
before
the
construction
of
highways.
that
is
the
net
benefits
attributable
and
directly
attributable
to
the
highway
construction
which
is
only
to
remaining
surrounding
trust
lands
must
be
at
least
increase
in
value
to
the
value
to
the
value
of
the
land
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
says
nothing
about
eminent
domain.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
second
place,
what
we
are
talking
about,
we
may
borrow
on
the
principles
to
a
certain
extent
and
in
eminent
domain
there
are
as
i
understand
it
two
different
rules.
one
is
that
you
can
offset
value
to
remaining
lands
belonging
to
the
condemnee
against
the
value
of
the
interest
taken.
the
rule
in
arizona
happens
to
be
different
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
this,
the
rule
in
arizona,
a.r.s.section
12-1122
is
that
you
can't
offset
benefit
to
remaining
trust
lands
only
against
the
severance
damages
that
is
the
amount
that
you
damage
those
remaining
trust
lands
and
not
against
the
value.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
contend
not
simply
because
we
contend
that
it
is
not
eminent
domain
that
is
the
applicable
rule.
i'll
develop
this
more
completely
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
we
contend
that
the
state
of
arizona
could
have
had
it
solely
elected
adopted
this
principle
of
eminent
domain
but
what
we
are
dealing
here
with
is
three
essential
provisions
in
our
view,
provisions
that
appear
in
section
28
of
the
enabling
act.
mr.
frank
has
referred
to
two
of
these
and
i
will
advert
to
them
in
a
moment
briefly
for
that
reason
but
first
is
the
public
auction
provisions.
mr.
frank
has
stated
there
is
a
blanket
provision
that
permits
of
no
exception
which
states
that
these
lands
must
be
disposed
of
by
public
auction
which
you
have
to
give
notice
of
that
public
auction
for
ten
weeks
once
each
week
for
a
period
of
10
weeks
in
two
different
newspapers.
the
second
provision
that
is
relevant
and
this
of
course
mr.
justice
fortas
is
particularly
going
to
bear
down
that
all
of
the
interest
shall
be
appraised
and
that
no
sale
or
other
disposal
thereof
shall
be
made
for
a
consideration
less
than
the
value
so
ascertained
and
finally
the
provision
that
has
not
been
yet
mentioned
this
day
but
a
provision
which
is
of
extreme
importance
is
the
catch
all
provision
that
comes
at
the
end
of
section
28
the
one
dealing
with
these
trust
land
provisions
and
says
this.
i
am
reading
from
the
appendix,
the
petitioner's
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
39,
"every
sale,
lease,
conveyance
or
contract
of
or
concerning
any
of
the
lands
hereby
granted
or
confirmed
or
the
use
thereof
or
the
national
products
thereof
not
made
in
substantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
null
and
void."
and
i'd
like
to
consider
first
as
a
background
to
the
value
provision
because
i
think
it
sheds
light
on
it
the
applicability
of
these
public
auction
provisions.
the
great
significance
of
this
pubic
auction
provision
is
that
they
don't
apply
to
use
this
for
highway
purposes.
every
governmental
agency
that
had
addressed
itself
to
this
problem
has
agreed
on
this
point
that
you
don't
have
to
submit
highways
which
are
--
lands
which
are
going
to
be
used
for
highway
purposes
to
these
public
auction
provisions
notice
for
over
a
period
of
10
weeks
and
so
forth.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
reason
is
obvious,
we're
dealing
here
with
strips
of
land
that
are
100
feet
wide,
a
mile
long,
and
bounded
on
each
end
by
a
proposed
highway.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
know
that
it
is
going
to
be
interested
in
bidding
on
those
--
on
the
strips,
on
the
long
narrow
strips
of
land
except
the
highway
department
and
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
at
all.
not
at
all
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
have
a
practical
reason
and
a
legal
reason
mr.
justice
white
and
this
is
the
practical
reason.
and
the
legal
reason
is
this
that
the
obvious
inappropriateness
of
these
public
auction
provisions
to
uses
for
highway
purposes
points
out
the
central
fact
that
when
congress
enacted
this
particular
provision
of
the
enabling
act,
it
did
not
have
in
mind
public
uses
in
general
and
particularly
uses
for
highway
practices.
as
mr.
frank
has
pointed
out
this
morning,
the
dominant
consideration
underlying
congress'
enactment
of
this
enabling
act
was
to
prevent
the
sale
of
these
lands
to
private
proprietors.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
alright.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
here
is
my
answer,
here
is
my
answer,
--
let
me
answer
it
in
two
steps.
i
first
of
all
say
its
obvious
inappropriateness
to
the
highway
context
is
saved
by
the
interaction
of
two
facts.
number
one,
the
fact
of
congress
obviously
did
not
consider
this
particular
problem.
and
number
two,
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
deal
with
this
specific
face
of
the
problem
it
did
deal
with
it
as
a
generic
type
by
this
substantial
conformity
clause.
therefore
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
in
all
fairness,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
overall
purpose
of
this
value
provision
is
this
that
this
is
the
basic
concept
underlying
a
value
provision.
the
state
has
given
a
basic
package
of
lands.
two
things,
any
proceeds
that
come
from
the
sale
of
those
lands
has
to
be
used
for
school
purposes.
there
is
no
other
permissible
---
mr.
rex
e.
lee
conceivably
so
but
this
is
not
the
only
restriction.
there
is
in
our
view
an
additional
restriction
and
that
is
the
one
that
is
imposed
by
this
value
provision.
that
the
--
the
state
was
given
a
basic
package
of
lands
until
those
lands
were
converted
into
cash.
once
they
were
converted
into
cash
the
cash
could
only
be
used
for
certain
purposes.
until
they
were
converted
into
cash,
the
state
had
an
additional
obligation
on
it
and
that
is
that
it
was
charged
to
an
obligation
of
seeing
to
it
that
the
total
value,
the
total
value
of
this
package
was
not
diminished.
now
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
it's
also
implicit
in
this
paragraph
which
says
that
these
shall
not
be
disposed
of
except
for
value
though
the
language
has
not
expressly
written
in
that
regard.
this
--
congress
set
forth
certain
general
restrictions
and
certain
general
principles,
manifestly
congress
could
not
in
1910
foresee
all
of
the
problems
that
are
going
to
occur.
a
case
in
point
did
not
foresee
that
problem.
now
i
will
get
into
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
congress
did
provide,
congress
did
recognize
that
it
couldn't
foresee
all
the
problems
and
therefore
it
provided
that
substantial
conformity
was
to
be
the
applicable
rule
within
the
state
of
arizona.
therefore,
the
obligation
which
is
imposed
upon
the
state
is
and
i
think
it
is
at
this
point
the
reasoning
of
the
government's
brief
is
particularly
helpful.
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
that
there
is
no
precise
blueprint
detailing
the
exact
nature
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
state
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
determined
by
the
general
principle
of
the
general
purposes
of
the
act
and
that
so
long
as
the
overall
value
of
the
trust
is
maintained
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
use
these
lands
for
public
purposes.
so
long
as
it's
in
substantial
conformity
for
the
purpose
of
the
act.
now,
is
it
we
submit
that
it
is
for
various
reasons
that
have
discussed
in
our
brief
i'd
like
to
mention
just
very
briefly
two
of
them.
one
is
that
this
is
not
a
noble
decision
and
the
only
one
of
its
kind
in
the
country.
mr.
frank
recognized
the
opinion
of
the
wyoming
supreme
court.
though
not
dealing
with
enabling
acts
there
are
other
states
for
example
new
jersey
which
in
the
constitution
has
certain
restrictions
placed
on
certain
kinds
of
lands.
we
have
cited
about
five
or
six
cases
in
our
briefs
dealing
with
those
type
of
constitutional
provisions
which
dignity
wise
are
of
a
simple
--
similar
type
of
dignity
of
this
enabling
act
and
various
different
states
have
held
that
in
these
lands
may
be
used
for
highway
construction
purposes
if
the
offsetting
value
increment
to
remaining
trust
land
is
at
least
equal
to
the
value
of
the
lands
taken
for
these
purposes
but
the
point
on
which
i
would
like
to
bear
down
particularly
is
the
point
that
arizona
is
entitled
to
interpret
value
as
meaning
value
to
each
of
the
trust
lands
and
not
just
value
to
the
lands
taken
for
the
reason
that
is
the
position
has
been
taken
by
the
united
states
attorney
general
over
a
period
of
50
years.
this
interpretation
is
significant
not
only
because
of
its
intrinsic
persuasiveness
but
also
by
virtue
of
the
bare
fact
that
it
is
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
the
attorney
general.
the
enforcement
response
--
well,
the
act
does
leave
it,
it
is
true
to
either
the
states
or
any
individual
the
right
to
enforce
the
provision
of
this
act
but
the
primary
responsibility,
the
first
line
of
defense
is
the
united
states
attorney
general.
there's
of
course
a
familiar
doctrine
that
interpretation
placed
upon
the
federal
statute
by
the
agency
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
that
statute
are
entitled
to
particular
weight
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out
for
the
court
in
udall
versus
tallman,
it
need
not
necessarily
be
the
only
interpretation
which
the
act
might
permit
nor
need
it
be
the
interpretation
which
we
as
an
original
manner
might
have
adopted
had
the
case
originally
had
arisen
as
a
judicial
case
or
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
the
particularly
significant
thing
about
the
interpretation
of
the
justice
department
in
this
case
is
that
it
extends
over
a
period
of
more
than
50
years.
as
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
pointed
out
the
practice
that
is
presently
under
attack
is
of
some
50
years
standing
in
this
state
of
arizona.
during
all
of
that
50-year
period,
united
states
attorney
general
has
never
taken
any
action
to
have
this
practice
declared
invalid.
this
acquiescence
we
submit
has
not
been
through
inadvertence.
in
those
instances
in
which
practices
have
occurred
which
have
truly
derogated
from
the
value
of
the
trust
the
united
states
attorney
general
had
been
swept
for
act.
for
example,
in
this
tall
timber
cases
which
have
been
so
prominently
referred
to
involved
were
12
suits
which
were
brought
in
the
territorial
court
for
the
new
mexico
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
similarly
in
1915
when
the
state
of
new
mexico
enacted
an
act,
a
statute
providing
that
3%
of
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
all
these
lands
should
be
used
to
advertise
the
advantages
and
resources
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
generally,
the
attorney
general's
office
was
successful
in
having
the
statute
declared
invalid
as
repugnant
to
the
enabling
act
and
this
was
the
irving
litigation
which
eventually
terminated
in
this
court.
the
action
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
irving
case
was
swept
and
decisive.
the
new
mexico
act
was
passed
on
march
8,
1915
and
the
federal
district
court
action
was
instituted
by
the
attorney
general
less
than
five
months
later
on
august
7,
1915
yet
during
all
the
time
that
this
ervien
litigation
was
progressing,
the
very
practice
which
is
under
attack
here
was
in
effect
under
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
united
states
attorney
general's
office
made
no
look
to
take
any
corrective
action.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir,
it
was
not.
but
we
have
there
in
two
states
side
by
side
that
are
identical
enabling
act
provisions
practiced
by
one
was
attacked,
a
practice
by
one
was
not.
this
of
course
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
there
are
determinative
differences
between
the
two
practices
and
we
submit
that
there
are
for
two
reason.
the
first
is
that
that
which
the
united
states
suggested
indicated
earlier
that
the
basic
concept
of
these
value
provisions
of
the
trust
is
that
a
certain
package
of
trust
land
has
conveyed
to
the
state
with
a
thought
in
mind
that
one
day
it
will
be
converted
into
cash
and
these
cash
will
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
schools,
hospitals,
reformatories
and
so
forth.
once
the
funds,
once
these
lands
are
converted
into
cash,
they
remain
invaluable.
you
can't
use
them
for
any
other
purpose
and
that's
the
first
difference.
if
the
state
of
new
mexico
directly
used
the
funds
resulting
from
the
sale
of
the
lands
themselves,
that
is
not
the
problem
in
this
case.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
rather
whether
or
how
the
lands
which
one
day
will
be
disposed
of
and
converted
into
cash
are
to
be
maintained
or
to
have
their
integral
value
maintained
so
that
at
that
time
that
they
are
disposed
of
the
value
will
not
be
lesser
because
the
use
that
has
been
made
of
the
interim
period.
the
second
difference
is
this,
mr.
frank
had
referred
to
the
fact
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
cited
with
approval
by
mr.
justice
mckinney's
majority
opinion.
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
you
see,
that
the
real
problem
that
the
court
there
was
concerned
with
was
the
fact
that
these
trust
lands
comprised
only
126
of
the
total
area
of
the
state
and
yet
there
has
been
126
of
the
lands
were
being
made
to
bear
the
brunt
of
an
advertising
program
which
presumably
would
benefit
the
entire
state,
the
opinion
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
if
this
in
fact
were
the
case
mr.
justice
black
it
would
bother
me
too.
what
we
submit
is
that
of
course
these
lands
do
not
bear
the
entire
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
black
i
have
no
idea
how
many
acres
have
already
been
taken.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
let
me
make
two
statements
with
the
regard
to
that.
in
the
first
place
of
course,
these
parcels
were
mostly
located
in
the
section
side
parcels,
the
enabling
act
says
section
2,
16,
32
and
36
so
that
they
would
principally
be
in
section
one
mile
square
parcels.
and
the
road
of
course
would
come
through
other
land
come
up
through
these
school
lands
and
would
go
across
the
lands
the
interstate
would
say
some
102,
100
feet
wide.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
but
i
think
what
we
have
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
first
issue
is
that
also
benefits
the
surrounding
trust
lands.
now
whether
it
does
in
fact
or
whether
this
has
been
adequately
proven,
i
will
get
to
it
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
think
that
we
also
have
to
assume
this
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
all
kinds
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
very
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh
a
limited
access
highway
where
you
might
go
50
miles
before
you
get
to
an
exit.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
this
simply
points
out
the
problem
that
the
posture
of
this
case
is
not
proper
for
the
consideration
of
this
particular
issue.
but
that
is
we
don't
have
in
this
record
any
evidence
as
to
what
type
of
highways
and
roads
there
are
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
am
going
to
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
do
not
mean
by
that
the
court
below
was
wrong.
i
mean
that
by
the
virtue
that
of
the
way
the
case
came
to
the
court
it
had
no
other
alternative
but
to
do
as
it
did.
let
me
just
say
at
this
point.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
assure
you
mr.
justice
white
i
will
get
to
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
will
be
over
that
in
more
detail
in
a
moment.
let
me
say
that
but
because
of
our
concept
that
it's
the
total
impact
of
the
entire
trust,
we
would
say
that
would
be
both.
that
is
in
a
particular
instance
when
you
open
up
entirely
new
lands
if
you
run
a
highway
across
a
particular
section,
manifestly
it's
going
to
have
some
effect
in
that
section.
we
think
that
it
is
always
a
benefit.
also
if
it's
an
area
previously
undeveloped
as
much
of
arizona
certainly
is
and
mr.
frank
himself
has
pointed
out
that
much
of
these
lands
are
simply
non-income
producing
at
the
present
time
presumably
because
they
are
inaccessible
and
you
may
have
also
benefits
to
other
nearby
lands
in
other
sections.
but
just
briefly
with
regards
to
the
lack
of
a
record,
the
only
support
for
the
proposition
that
in
fact
there
has
been
40,000
acres
or
$9
million
or
whatever
it
is
if
the
fact
that
there
have
self
serving
conclusionary
and
totally
extra
record
assertions
of
fact
to
that
effect
made
in
the
proceedings,
made
in
the
proceedings
before
this
court.indeed
in
article
appearing
recently
in
the
arizona
republic
the
suggestion
is
made
that
these
facts
--
that
these
figures
are
incorrect.
manifestly
this
is
not
the
tribunal
in
which
that
particular
issue
should
be
resolved.
we
simply
point
out
and
i
will
go
into
this
more
fully
in
just
a
moment
that
because
of
the
posture
of
the
case
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
raise
--
the
issues
that
are
in
this
case
we
really
feel
that
probably
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted,
and
it
should
await
future
cases
which
the
record
is
proper.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
consider
the
added
value
to
all
the
school
lands.
we
think
that
this
is
consistent
with
viewing
the
impact
of
highway
construction
on
the
total
trust
on
the
total
land
which
is
our
basic
problem.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
distinction
is
this.
that
as
i
read
the
enabling
act,
there
was
quite
a
definite
purpose
to
place
severe
restrictions
rather
severe
restrictions
against
the
use
of
these
lands
for
private
purposes
except
under
these
restrictive
purposes
for
example
the
public
auction
and
so
forth.
because
of
what
i
regard
to
be
this
basic
purpose
of
the
trust
land
provisions
of
the
enabling
act
we
would
say
that
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
must
be
adhered
to
whenever
these
lands
are
used
for
private
purposes.
but
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
use
by
the
public
itself
for
the
purpose
of
construction
of
roads
then
this
is
an
apt
instance
for
application
of
what
congress
provided
would
be
the
governing
rule
that
only
those
transactions
not
in
substantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
could
be
proscribed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
i
have
an
answer
for
it.
and
the
answer
is
this.
when
congress
passed
this
enabling
act,
it
foresaw
certain
problems.
it
did
not
foresee
all
of
the
problems
and
it
recognized
that
it
didn't
foresee
all
of
the
problems.
one
of
these
problems
was
private
use.
another
was
use
by
reclamation
project.
because
congress
recognized
that
it
didn't
foresee
all
of
the
problems,
it
provided
a
catch
all
of
raising
saving
funds
at
the
end
that
only
those
transactions
not
in
substantial
conformity.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
agree
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
congress
did
provide
that
those
transactions
are
in
substantial
conformity.
i
refer
to
another
canon
of
statutory
interpretation
that
the
language
has
meaning
particularly
when
you
consider
where
are
these
particular
paragraph
comes.
section
28
is
the
basic
section
that
deals
with
these
trust
lands
provisions
and
right
at
the
end
of
section
28
and
presumably
an
all
embracing
provision
that
all
transactions
not
in
substantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
shall
be
null
and
void.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
of
course
is
not
my
point
mr.
chief
justice.
they
didn't
anticipate
the
need
for
public
roads.
what
they
didn't
anticipate
was
the
possible
conflict.
obviously,
it
was
not
anticipated.
and
the
possible
conflict
between
these
particular
provisions
dealing
with
public
auction
and
the
needs
which
might
arise
in
1966
say
for
example
as
to
the
need
for
an
immediate
taking
and
the
re-inimical
--
the
fact
that
it
would
be
clearly
inimical
to
the
state's
highway
construction
program
if
you
had
to
simply
wait
for
a
10-week
period
in
which
you
went
through
these
public
auction
notice
provisions
before
you
can
take
the
lands
and
use
them
for
highway
construction
purposes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
presumably
because
the
reclamation
projects
had
someone
who
had
a
good
lobby
there
and
anticipated
the
problem.
my
---
i
really
don't
know
--
i
really
don't
know.
all
i
know
is
that
we
do
have
the
language
of
the
statute
that
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
some
portions
of
the
statute
as
to
which
a
too
literal
application
would
result
in
an
unintended
consequence.
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
congress
did
provide
a
safety
valve
as
a
generic
type
against
the
possibility
of
a
too
literal
application
resulting
in
unintended
consequences
and
i
can
describe
no
other
reason
for
this
substantial
conformity
provision.
now
let
me
address
myself
just
very
briefly
to
the
question
of
assuming
that
the
net
value
enhancement
theory
is
an
acceptable
theory
upon
whom
does
the
burden
lie.
the
united
states
suggests
that
it
should
lie
with
the
highway
department
and
as
an
abstract
proposition
we
are
not
out
of
sympathy
with
this.
if
all
we
have
to
go
on
with
the
bare
pages
of
the
enabling
act
itself
on
the
day
following
its
enactment
but
we
would
disagree
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
on
three
different
occasions
determined
that
in
fact
the
constructions
of
highways
in
arizona
does
result
in
a
net
value
enhancement
to
trust
lands
and
this
gets
us
back
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
earlier
and
i
think
perhaps
i
can
anticipate
a
question
that
follows
it
and
that
is
was
this
not
an
arbitrary
decision?
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
in
the
first
place,
it's
difficult
to
fault
the
arizona
supreme
court
for
handling
this
case
the
way
it
did
because
of
the
posture
in
which
the
case
arose.
at
the
time
that
this
case
came
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
on
a
writ
of
provision,
there
were
already
outstanding
two
prior
decisions
of
that
court
holding
that
in
fact
the
construction
of
highways
across
these
trust
lands
resulted
in
a
net
benefit
not
to
lands
as
a
whole
but
to
the
trust
lands
themselves.
now
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
that
those
lands
that
are
being
in
between
justice
black
i
was
just
referring
to
other
school
lands.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
in
our
view
it's
not
a
matter
of
who
has
to
pay
how
much.
it's
a
matter
of
after
you
get
through
building
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
because
of
peculiar
arizona
rule
and
it
may
exist
in
other
instances.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
agree
with
you
but
on
the
other
hand
if
it
has
been
determined
by
a
competent
process
and
i'd
like
to
deal
just
briefly
with
what
is
a
competent
process.
if
it
has
been
determined
by
a
competent
process
that
in
fact
after
you
put
a
road
across
trust
lands,
take
a
given
stretch
of
roads
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
other
lands
that
trust
lands
considered
just
and
by
themselves
are
worth
more
by
virtue
of
the
bare
fact
that
that
road
has
been
constructed
in
the
process.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
may
be.
they
may
be
and
this
may
also
be
a
consideration
the
state
of
arizona
may
wish
to
take
into
consideration
there.
and
i
think
that
if
they
did
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
for
example
if
the
state
were
to
adopt
a
principle
of
compensation
to
--
as
to
private
lands.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
not.
some
states
do
but
the
state
of
arizona
in
normal
eminent
domain
procedure
only
allows
benefits
to
be
offset
against
what
we
call
severance
damages
and
not
against
the
damages
from
the
actual
taking.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
presume
it
would
be
so,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there's
nothing
in
this
on
the
record.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
federal
highway
program
mr.
justice
fortas
but
that
is
my
understanding
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
informed
by
my
co-counsel
who
spends
time,
full
time
in
highway
department
matters.
this
is
not
done.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.i
really
don't
know
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
record
as
to
what
the
procedure
is
and
i
am
really
not
familiar
with
the
procedure
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
pay
for
what,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
case
of
an
interstate
highway
then
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
act,
part
would
be
paid
by
the
federal
government
and
part
would
be
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
accord
of
whatever
the
percentage
would
be.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
are
cases
where
there
would
be
more
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
other
side
prevails
then
the
benefit
goes
to
the
trust.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
there
is
no
question
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
be
more
of
a
benefit
but
we
submit
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
if
a
value
--
if
actual
cash
has
to
be
paid
from
the
highway
department
to
the
land
department,
and
in
addition
to
that
they
get
the
value
increase
resulting
from
the
highway
construction
that
the
trust
will
be
greater
in
risk
but
we
submit
that
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
what
is
the
greatest
benefit
that
can
possibly
be,
that
can
possibly
be
obtained
for
this
reason
the
trust
--
the
trust
provisions
deal
in
terms
of
value
and
the
standard
as
we
see
it
is
that
value
must
be
maintained.
if
it
is
maintained,
then
the
state
may
deal
with
these
--
may
use
these
lands
for
highway
construction
purposes.
in
the
final
analysis,
it's
true
that
enabling
acts
are
federal
statutes,
but
many
of
the
provisions
of
these
enabling
acts
deal
particularly
with
problem
areas
which
substantively
are
within
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
state
itself.
for
example,
the
establishment
of
schools,
the
establishment
of
hospitals,
and
the
establishment
of
reformatories
lies
within
the
exclusive
responsibility
of
the
state
itself.
similarly,
the
setting
of
the
standards
according
to
which
these
institutions
are
to
be
maintained
is
an
exclusive
state
responsibility.
once
the
state
is
determined
and
you
can
set
the
standards,
the
state
can
set
the
standard
for
school
just
as
high
or
low,
or
just
it
wants
to.
if
it
sets
up
high,
that
means
that
more
money
is
going
to
be
required.
once
the
standard
has
been
set
to
whatever
extent
the
school
trust
funds
are
insufficient
to
pay
the
bill,
the
difference
is
going
to
have
to
be
made
up
by
the
state
itself
and
regardless
of
which
way
this
determination
has
made
as
to
whether
highway
department
funds
have
to
be
paid
to
the
state
department,
state
land
department
no
matter
on
what
circumstances,
the
eventual
bite
is
going
to
be
felt
by
the
state
itself
through
its
taxing
process.
all
we're
saying
is
this
that
in
working
out
its
overall
governmental
problems
of
providing
for
schools,
hospitals,
reformatories
and
highways,
all
of
which
are
state
responsibilities.
the
state
should
be
entitled
to
incorporate
into
its
total
governmental
scheme
that
interpretation
of
the
enabling
act
which
best
comports
with
its
total
scheme
and
which
it
fits
in
best
with
the
other
constituent
parts
of
that
scheme.
it
follows
then
that
if
the
state
of
new
mexico
wants
to
interpret
its
enabling
act
as
requiring
that
only
--
that
value
means
only
value
to
the
particular
lands
that
are
taken,
then
this
is
perfectly
within
the
right
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
do
so
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
state
of
arizona
must
adopt
a
similarly
restrictive
view.
we
submit
simply
as
to
the
issue
of
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
was
made
by
persons
who
are
familiar
with
arizona.
they
are
familiar
with
its
problems,
with
its
history
and
with
its
geography.
we
don't
know
what
considerations
they
took
into
account.
we
do
know
that
they
are
--
in
the
studies
made
in
the
state
of
texas
and
elsewhere
which
indicate
rather
forcefully,
rather
dramatically
that
highway
construction
across
even
developed
lands,
the
golf
freeway
in
houston
and
the
dallas
expressway
in
the
suburbs
of
dallas.it
illustrate
rather
dramatically
that
the
effect
of
construction
of
highways
across
lands
is
to
fantastically
increase
the
value
of
those
lands.
in
the
case
of
the
dallas
study,
the
increase
of
value
of
the
surrounding
lands
was
even
in
excess
of
the
cost
of
construction
of
the
highway
itself
and
we
don't
whether
the
members
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
took
these
particular
factors
into
consideration
or
not.
we
do
know
that
tourism
is
the
fourth
largest
industry
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we
know
that
historians
have
assigned
an
important
role
to
highways
in
the
development
of
the
state
interest
presumably
also
therefore
of
its
lands.
at
the
very
least,
these
decisions
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
are
entitled
to
some
weight
and
are
entitled
not
to
be
rejected
out
of
hand
as
though
they
never
existed
at
all.
at
the
very
least,
we
submit
they
are
entitled
to
sufficient
weight
to
shift
the
burden
to
those
who
would
contend
that
the
conclusions
reached
there
are
not
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
black,
if
we
are
correct
in
our
theory
i
would
think
that
they
would
be
equal
in
achieving
this
purpose
because
of
the
fact
that
a
dollar
increment
to
a
surrounding
land
is
just
as
effective
as
a
dollar
actually
paid
for
lands
that
are
taken
for
that
purpose.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
consider
the
total
impact
on
the
value
of
all
of
the
lands
taken
as
a
whole,
all
of
the
trust
lands.
we
offset
only
the
value
of
the
lands
taken
from
the
trust
against
the
value
increment
to
trust
lands
themselves
in
the
trust.
the
private
lands,
we
leave
out
of
them
entirely
because
the
private
lands
simply
don't
enter
into
it.
it's
the
trust
lands
that
we
take
into
consideration.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
it
it's
a
question
of
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
extent
that
it
is
a
matter
of
bookkeeping
mr.
justice
black
in
answer
to
your
question
then
i
would
contend
that
since
the
ultimate
burden
is
going
to
be
born
by
the
state
of
arizona,
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
incorporate
into
its
total
overall
scheme
that
interpretation
of
the
enabling
act
which
best
fits
within
its
overall
scheme
so
long
as
insubstantial
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
we
submit
this
is.
