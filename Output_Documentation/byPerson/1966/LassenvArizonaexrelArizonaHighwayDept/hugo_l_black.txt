mr.
frank,
does
this
trust
fund
differ
and
essentially
from
the
school
lands
in
other
western
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
were
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
say
the
state
of
arizona
would
have
powers
to
build
highways
to
these
schools
on
land
and
assess
the
school
lands
for
their
benefit
confirmed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
not
why
can
they
do
it
the
other
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
that,
the
way
to
test
that
out
is
to
test
it
out
under
the
general
laws
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
they
build
that
highway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
find
it
a
little
bit
difficult
to
say
that
the
state
can't
directly
assess
the
school
lands,
the
value
of
the
highways
built
through
them
or
next
to
them
be
a
little
difficult
to
leave
over
there
and
say
they
could
do
it
indirectly
by
the
method
you
suggest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
will
leave
it
up
to
the
state
to
fix
school
lands
that
given
to
the
state
for
school
purposes
only
intact
but
nothing
else
will
work
and
that's
the
state
decide
when
it
build
roads
there
and
then
make
them
pay
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
am
talking
about
special
benefits.
that
way,
against
land
which
is
set
apart
for
other
purpose.
it
wasn't
intended
whether
to
leave
that
land
over
for
assessment
by
the
state
to
build
roads
through
the
lands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
pays.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
maintain
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
raise
him
there
problematic
method
of
computation
in
order
to
protect
the
state's
interest
and
the
school's
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whether
you
have
the
burden
(voice
overlap)
you
still
just
prevent
the
complications
of
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
these
are
difficult
to
protect
the
states
interest
or
school's
interest
to
possess
--
to
pay
money,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
most
certainly
they
have
it
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
is
not
usually
good
as
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
to
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
simpler
thing
about
that
(inaudible)
you
say
certain
part
of
the
lands
would
bear
the
entire
brunt
which
cause
it,
should
all
the
people
from
the
sale
or
all
the
people
there.
what
you
have
here
is
that
a
certain
part
of
this
government
land
which
has
been
used
for
school
purpose
certain
part
of
it
that
at
the
time
(inaudible)
of
the
road
building
is
and
through
its
properties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
there
have
been
9
--
how
many
acres
already
taken
with
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wasn't
that
to
be
borne
broad
building
as
the
job
to
all
the
people
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
will
benefit
the
people
all
over
the
state
and
the
people
--
the
nation
(inaudible)
highway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
land
intervening
between
that
you
told
the
chief
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
am
talking
about
private
lands.
why
shouldn't
they
pay
as
much
of
it
as
the
public
lands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
whose
benefits.
and
if
it
benefited
them
as
much
why
should
the
trust
land
have
to
pay
it
all
not
only
that
those
to
them
but
all
through
the
intervening
private
landowners.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
couldn't
keep
it,
that
peculiar
arizona
rule
couldn't
keep
that
from
putting
a
cost
on
road
construction
on
land
that
others
are
just
somewhat
responsible
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
trust
lands
and
other
lands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
the
intervening
lands,
are
they
worth
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
considering
these
two
or
three
plan
you
had
on
this
line,
which
on
in
your
judgment
can
complete
the
function,
will
most
surely
guarantee
but
not
a
dime
of
the
school
plan
will
be
spent
for
anything
except
school
funds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
there
a
question
of
bookkeeping?
what
you
have
here
is
a
system,
one
system
which
would
guarantee
not
a
dime
went
out
of
those
schools,
or
not
a
particle
of
that
land
went
out
without
going
to
the
school
funds
and
it's
a
question
of
bookkeeping.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
question
of
bookkeeping
i
should
say
the
burden,
the
likelihood
will
always
exist
that
the
state
funds
can
--
that
funds
can
be
best
protected
following
the
statutory
method
lend
and
pay
money.
justice
hugo
l.

how
could
congress
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
congress
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
congress
can
withdraw
its
gift?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
put
on
that
addition
that
it
has
to
be
mutual.
justice
hugo

mr.

does
