do
you
say
that
the
exempts
to
the
red
cross
as
the
instrumentality
rests
on
this
congressional
assertion
over
the
exemption
or
is
this
or
just
a
judicial
idea
that
federal
instrumentalities
should
be
exempt?
justice
byron

but
you
don't
think
that
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
here
attempts
to
grant
any
more
of
an
exception
for
federal
instrumentality
that
would
be
true
under
the
case
law?
justice
byron

you
think
any
entity
which
performs
to
any
extent
as
the
federal
instrumentality
if
the
federal
instrumentality
right
across
the
board
is
short?
now,
let
us
assume
that
95%
of
the
work
of
red
cross
is
a
“case
work”,
social
service
work,
and
it
is
certainly
the
red
cross
that
it
did
deal
of
it,
all
the
private
operations.
let
us
assume
that
95%
in
this
work,
does
that
5%

billing
all
these
things
that
you

require
such
full
close

what
(voice

shouldn't
take
your

you're

i
would

you

justice

so
you
do
rely

this

your

that
we
