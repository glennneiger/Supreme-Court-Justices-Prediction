mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
dealt
with
the
jurisdictional
issues
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
specific
questions,
but
if
there
are
none,
i
would
pass
on
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
american
national
red
cross,
the
organization
which
is
here
in
issue
is,
we
submit,
an
organization
which
is
formed
by
the
federal
government
and
which
performs
a
large
number
of
important
federal
duties
in
close
coordination
with
the
other
federal
agencies.
we
agree
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
argument
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
made.
the
employees
of
the
american
national
red
cross
are
not
the
employees
of
the
united
states,
any
more
than
the
employees
of
the
national
bank
are
the
employees
of
the
united
states,
but
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
lone
determinative
here.
we
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
operation
of
the
american
national
red
cross,
the
functions
it
performs,
the
degree
to
which
it
performs
them
in
close
coordination
with
the
united
states
and
the
extent
to
which
the
american
national
red
cross
is
provided
with
services,
facilities,
supplies,
etcetera
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
it
is
not
dispositive.
as
counsel
of
the
appellant
points
out
title
xxxvi
of
the
united
states
code
contains
the
charters
of
a
number
of
federally
incorporated
organizations.
the
congress,
of
course,
never
put
the
red
cross
as
charter
in
title
xxxvi,
the
revisers
did
and
congress
has
never
approved
that,
but
congress
has
recently
enacted
a
statute
that
we
think
is
helpful
in
this
regard
and
it's
not
mentioned
in
our
brief.
section
1101
of
title
xxxvi
provides
that
the
following
corporations,”
and
then
it
contains
a
list,
are
constituted
as
“private
corporations
established
under
federal
law,
private
corporations”.
it
uses
this
term
in
making
certain
requirement
that
they
be
audited
by
cpas
etcetera
and
in
listing
the
corporations
which
are
private
corporations
established
under
federal
law,
congress
listed
each
and
every
organization
within
title
xxxvi
with
four
exceptions;
three
of
them
are
commissions
wholly
financed
by
the
united
states
the
officers
of
which
are
wholly
appointed
either
by
the
president
or
office
of
the
united
states
government
regulating
battle
monuments
and
civil
wars,
centennials
and
things
like
that
and
the
only
other
organization
which
is
not
listed
there
is
the
american
national
red
cross.
before
1860,
it
was
not
uncommon
for
an
army
after
a
battle
to
retire
from
the
field,
to
regroup
and
press
on
the
battle
and
leave
it
wounded
and
sick
soldiers
on
the
field.
therefore,
in
1864
a
number
of
governments
convened
in
geneva
and
signed
what
is
the
first
geneva
convention.
that
convention,
for
the
first
time,
imposed
upon
the
member
governments,
the
requirement
and
the
duty
that
they
care
for
the
sick
and
wounded
of
both
sides
in
a
conflict,
both
their
own
and
their
enemies
and
they
authorized
each
member
government
to
form
a
red
cross
society,
a
national
red
cross
society.
the
united
states
became
a
party
to
that
treaty
in
about
1880
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
american
national
red
cross
was
formed.
in
1900,
congress
for
the
first
time
gave
it
a
national
charter.
now,
whatever
the
status
of
the
red
cross
was
up
until
that
time
and
beyond
up
until
1905,
we
submit
that
in
1905
an
act
which
congress
passed,
made
it
a
federal
instrumentality.
at
that
time,
congress
passed
what
is
referred
to
extensively
in
our
brief
as
the
act
of
1905.
it
dissolved
the
existing
red
cross
society
and
it
formed
what
is
now
the
american
national
red
cross,
the
charter
for
which
is
in
title
xxxvi.
it
gave
this
new
red
cross
society,
the
american
national
red
cross,
all
of
the
property
and
delegated
to
it
all
of
the
duties
and
the
word
“duties”
was
specifically
used,
of
the
old
red
cross
society
and
designated
it
the
new
american
national
red
cross
as
the
organization
which
is
to
perform
the
duties
of
the
united
states
government
under
the
geneva
convention
of
1864
and
any
future
convention
of
similar
nature
and
there
have
been
two:
1920
and
1949.
in
the
preamble
to
that
act,
the
1905
act,
congress
said
this.
“the
importance
of
the
work
of
the
red
cross
demands
a
repeal
of
the
present
charter
and
the
reincorporation
of
the
society
under
government
supervision”.
in
the
act
of
1905,
congress
gave
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
power
to
appoint
two-thirds
of
the
red
cross'
board
of
directors,
including
its
chairman.
it
provided
that
the
red
cross
was
to
be
audited
each
year
by
the
department
of
defense
and
the
war
department
and
that
the
red
cross
was
to
submit
audited
statements
both
the
detailed
report
of
its
proceedings
during
the
year
and
a
detailed
full
and
complete
itemized
account
of
its
receipts
and
expenditures.
now,
the
provision
regarding
receipts
and
expenditures
still
remains
and
each
year,
the
department
of
defense
performs
an
audit.
the
congress
subsequently
saw
fit
to
reduce
the
number
of
appointees
which
the
president
makes
to
the
red
cross'
board
to
less
than
the
majority.
but
as
congress
has
shown
in
some
more
recent
legislation,
specifically
a
1956
resolution
or
a
1952
committee
report,
it
still
regards
the
red
cross
as
adequately
supervised
by
the
federal
government
even
though
it
no
longer
has
a
majority
of
its
board
appointed
by
the
president.
and
i
think
that
the
remainder
of
my
argument
would
demonstrate
that
that
is
adequately
briefed.
in
the
act
of
1905,
congress
first
designated
the
red
cross
as
having
the
duty
to
perform
the
united
states'
obligations
under
the
geneva
conventions.
it
also
delegated
two
other
functions
to
the
red
cross,
both
of
which,
i
submit,
are
important
governmental
functions.
first
the
job
of
rendering
aid
to
the
military
services
of
the
united
states,
all
branches
of
the
armed
services;
and
second,
the
task
of
carrying
on
disaster
relief
in
case
of
national
disasters.
i
would
like
to
take
up
in
some
detail
each
of
these
three
functions
which
the
red
cross
has
since
1905
performed.
first
its
geneva
convention
duties;
these
might
include
such
duties
are
caring
for
or
supervising
the
care,
a
medical
care
given
to
captured
enemy
wounded.
it
might
include
the
inspection
of
facilities
afforded
for
either
american
troops
captured
by
the
enemy
or
given
to
enemy
troops
captured
by
the
united
states.
it
also
includes
the
arranging
of
communications
between
us
soldiers
in
enemy
prison
camps
and
their
families
at
home.
it
includes
the
transmitting
of
food
parcels
and
supplies,
medical
supplies,
clothing
from
the
united
states
to
our
troops
who
were
imprisoned
abroad.
for
example,
during
the
second
world
war,
the
red
cross
was
instrumental
in
arranging
and
through
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
transporting
to
american
troops
in
germany,
japan
approximately
30
million
parcels
over
the
course
of
that
four-year
conflict.
it
also
arranged
a
large
number
of
communications
back
and
forth
between
families
of
us
servicemen
captured
abroad
and
those
servicemen.
all
of
these
activities,
of
course,
require
the
closest
coordination
between
the
american
national
red
cross
and
the
american
department
of
defense
and
to
some
extent,
the
state
department
because
contacts
with
foreign
governments
both
directly
and
through
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
are
certainly
of
interest
to
this
government.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
submit
first
of
all
that
it
is
an
implied
exemption
from
the
constitution
that
when
congress
creates
an
organization,
gives
that
important
federal
functions
to
perform,
arranges
for
to
do
so
in
close
coordination
with
the
united
states
executive
agencies
including
the
military,
state
department
and
when
it
provides
some
financial
support
for
it
and
takes
all
the
steps,
which
it
has
done
with
regard
the
american
national
red
cross,
that
the
constitution
grants
it
an
immunity
just
as
this
court
held
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
with
regard
to
the
original
bank
of
the
united
states
which,
of
course,
was
80%
owned
by
private
shareholders
and
the
20%
by
the
united
states
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
think
that
the
constitution
is
sufficient
to
achieve
the
purpose
which
we
are
here
discussing.
i
think,
however,
that
if
this
court
would
have
find
for
some
reason,
which
i
cannot
at
this
time
conceive,
that
the
constitution
is
not
sufficient
that
the
statutes
here
in
question
would
affirmatively
grant
an
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
shouldn't
think
that
if
an
organization
did
5%
of
its
work
in
close
coordination
with
the
government
and
95%
of
its
work
privately
that
it
would
become
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
i
should
think,
however,
that
the
facts
show,
as
i
will
endeavor
to
prove
here,
that
the
red
cross
is
not
in
the
category
of
organizations
which
you
have
described.
the
red
cross
doesn't
give
an
incidental
amount
of
its
effort
to
cooperate
with
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
for
what
might
you
said
that
it
is
partially
tax
exempt,
the
salaries
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
certainly
think
that
would
be
conceivable
solution
that
congress
could
enact.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
present
statute
do
enact
that
sort
of
the
solution.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
i
rely
on
the
constitution
and
the
statute
would
have
nothing
but
a
negative
effect,
a
waiver
of
the
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
had
been
no
of
such
cases
that
i
know
of
reaching
that
conclusion.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
an
inconceivable
result.
certainly,
that
result
could
be
reached
and
i
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
that
is
the
result
this
court
reaches,
then
not
5%
but
99.5%
of
the
red
cross'
activities
would
be
covered.
and
that
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
my
position
is
that
you
need
not
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
the
red
cross'
activities
as
i
will
demonstrate
are
99%
or
95%
directed
towards
achieving
its
federal
duties
and
that
many
of
the
things
which
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i'm
talking
about
worldwide.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
record
has
very
little
in
it
about
any
specific
activities
within
colorado.
the
record
has
a
great
deal
in
it
about
the
general
activities
of
the
red
cross
and
the
purpose
for
which
the
local
activities
take
place.
for
example,
if
you're
referring
to
blood
collection
drives
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
would
try
to
answer
your
question
this
way.
i
would
ask
your
indulgence
to
pass
on
to
the
next
point
i've
got
here
and
then
come
back
to
it
because
my
next
point
is,
many
of
the
activities
which
the
red
cross
performs
for
the
military
and
in
disaster
relief
which
require
the
existence
of
state
and
local
chapters
and
the
way
in
which
those
state
and
local
chapters
are
integrated
into
a
nationwide
and
even
a
worldwide
network
which
are
absolutely
essential
for
the
performance
of
the
red
cross'
duties.
i
would
find
your
question
very
difficult
were
this
not
the
fact.
certainly,
if
there
was
no
one
with
any
given
state
performing
any
federal
duties
or
any
federal
functions,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
the
employees
within
that
state
couldn't
be
taxed.
but
i
submit
that
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
think
we
do
have
record
of
evidence.
we
have
testimony
among
other
things
from
the
mid
west
region
manager
of
the
red
cross
which
includes
colorado
and
he
talked
in
here
about
the
services
which
are
performed
in
the
mid
west
region
and
in
general
about
the
services
which
the
chapters
performed.
he
did
not
say,
“this
colorado
chapter
performs
this
service”.
the
inference
is
there,
it's
pregnant.
in
every
sentence
he
says
that
he
is
not
trying
to
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
would
take
the
position
that
it's
either
one
way
or
another,
yes.
i
could
conceive
of
this
court
reaching
a
different
result
but
i
don't
think
it's
warranted
either
by
the
facts
or
by
the
law
or
by
the
cases
this
court
has
decided.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
in
that
case,
it
could
become
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
and
it
would
depend
on
the
facts,
such
as
the
facts
i'm
here
discussing.
one
point
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
of
course,
not.
but
if
the
government
created
a
new
corporation
to
be
engaged
in
ship
building
and
this
organization
was
a
non-profit
corporation,
some
of
the
officers
of
which
were
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
which
the
united
states
supplied
a
great
deal
of
aid
to
in
the
form
of
supplies
and
services
and
personnel,
transportation,
communication,
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
services
annually
and
this
organization
then
built
ships
solely
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
government
and
naval
officers
were
working
in
that
shipyard
hand
in
hand
with
the
other
employees
of
this
non-profit
corporation,
i
think
that
on
those
facts,
it
would
be
very
likely
that
that
corporation
would
become
an
arm
of
the
federal
government
just
as
this
court
held
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
because
i
think
this
court
has
traditionally
held
over
the
years
that
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver
where
the
organization
is,
as
i've
described
it,
it
has
by
force
of
the
constitution
itself
a
portion
of
the
united
states'
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
by
force
of
the
constitution.
in
the
clallam
county
case
decided
by
this
court
a
few
years
ago
involving
a
government
corporation
formed
to
build
not
ships
but
their
airplanes
for
world
war
i
which
was
a
non-profit
organization
staffed
by
the
government
people
at
the
high
levels
and
the
executive
positions,
this
court
held
that
it
had
an
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
that
would
be
one
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
a
profit
making
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
i've
been
using
those
two
terms
as
meaning
the
same
thing.
let
me
define
them
further.
when
i
say
“constitutionally
exempt”,
i
mean
exempt
by
the
force
of
the
constitution
without
congress
saying
a
word,
but
congress
can
waive
that
exemption.
it
has
implied
constitutional
exemption
and
that's
just
what
the
court
said
in
the
clallam
county
case.
this
court
said
that
the
immunity
is
derived
from
the
constitution
in
the
same
sense
and
upon
the
same
principle
that
it
would
be
of
expressed
in
so
many
words.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
could
be.
this
court
so
held
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
with
regard
to
the
bank
of
the
united
states
which
was
a
profit
making
corporation,
80%
owned
by
private
shareholders.
it
could
be
but
i
think
that
that's
one
factor
to
be
considered.
this
court
would
be
much
less
likely
to
conclude
that
a
given
organization,
if
it
were
a
profit-making
organization.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
on
the
constitutional
basis.
the
united
states
doesn't
typically
form
profit-making
organizations
and
make
them
instrumentalities
tax
exempt.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
this
colorado
tax?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it's
unemployment
compensation
tax.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
used
partially
to
pay
an
employment
compensation
benefits
to
the
employees
of
the
particular
employer
who
has
been
discharged.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
record
doesn't
speak
on
that.
but
i
say
that
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
that
in
two
steps.
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
the
state
of
colorado
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
the
red
cross,
directly
in
proportion
to
the
benefits
which
its
employees
received.
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
the
state
of
colorado
sought
the
tax
and
didn't
back
tax
the
red
cross
over
$28,000
in
the
3
½
years
in
colorado
that
this
suit
was
in
progress.
it
paid
out
during
that
period
$404
in
benefits
to
red
cross
employees,
a
ratio
of
$1
benefits
for
$70
of
tax
collected.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
it
goes
to
the
very
nature
of
the
tax.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
congress
in
1966
considered
a
bill
to
specifically
deal
with
this
point.
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
deal
--
replay
with
just
a
couple
of
the
items
that
were
raised
before
lunch
and
then
hopefully
to
spend
the
last
three
or
four
minutes
on
the
activities
of
the
red
cross,
it
is
our
position,
first
of
all,
that
if
the
red
cross
is,
as
we
contend
exempt
from
state
taxation
that
that
would
include
any
type
of
tax
on
the
red
cross'
operations
as
what
this
court
said
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
that's
what
this
court
has
reiterated
in
perhaps
in
dozen
decisions
and
this
would
include
the
tax
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
employing
individuals.
now,
congress
recognized
when
it
enacted
the
social
security
amendments
of
1960
that
this
was
the
result.
we
submit
that
congress
had
a
very
good
reason
for
waiving
red
cross
exempt
from
state
unemployment
compensation
tax.
this
reason
is
demonstrated
by
the
recent
bill
that
came
within
a
hair
of
passage
in
the
1966
congress.
both
houses
passed
it
but
they
failed
to
resolve
a
few
minor
inconsistencies
in
conference.
that
bill
submitted
all
charities,
including
the
red
cross
although
not
by
name,
all
charities
to
state
taxation
and
required
all
states
to
impose
unemployment
compensation
taxes
on
them
but
specifically
required
that
those
taxes
be
in
direct
proportion
to
the
benefits
paid
out
to
the
employees
and
congress
in
the
extensive
committee
reports
and
hearings
that
held
on
those
bills
recognized
that
charitable
organizations
have
a
much
lower
turnover
rate
in
employee,
in
personnel
than
do
most
industrial
concerns.
and,
therefore,
congress
took
the
position
that
some
states
in
colorado
was
specifically
mentioned
as
we
set
forth
in
our
briefs
in
this
hearings,
some
states
have
been
taxing
charitable
corporations
in
such
a
manner
that
the
income
from
the
charitable
corporations
is
used
to
subsidize
the
benefits
paid
out
to
employees
of
industrial
concerns.
they
do
not
give
them
adequate
recognition
for
their
excellent
employee
and
employment
records.
second,
with
regards
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
we
submit
that
where
an
organization
is
predominantly
as
is
this
one,
engaged
in
governmental
activities
in
the
entire
national
organization
is
a
–
pointed
in
this
direction
and
intended
for
this
purpose
that
whether
or
not
a
given
individual
chapter
may
engage
in
more
or
less
governmental
activity
is
not
the
issue.
we
also
submit
that
there
is
some
evidence
on
the
record
supporting
those
colorado
activities,
not
just
mid
west
region.
for
example,
there
is
a
discussion
by
the
mid
west
regional
direct
of
the
activities
at
fit
simons
army
hospital
and
that
institution
is
in
colorado.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
don't
mean
in
any
way
to
deprecate
any
of
the
activities
carried
on
by
these
many
fine
organizations
but
the
red
cross
is
the
only
organization
which
is
created
by
active
congress,
heavily
supported
by
federal
contributions
of
services
and
supplies
and
activities,
a
number
of
the
directors
of
which
are
appointed
by
congress
which
has
imposed
upon
it
federal
treaty
duties,
federal
duties
in
disasters,
federal
duties
with
regard
to
aiding
the
military.
many
of
the
other
organizations
such
as
the
salvation
army
of
the
us
owned
do
perform
some
such
functions.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
the
uso
is
perhaps
the
closest
organization
to
the
red
cross
but
no
other
organization
comes,
i
should
to
say,
within
a
country
mile
of
the
red
cross.
the
salvation
army,
for
example,
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
the
appellant
said,
the
record
demonstrates
over
and
over
again
that
the
salvation
armies
activities
in
this
regard
are
much
less
in
extent
that
those
of
the
red
cross
and
that
in
most
federal
institutions
including
all
military
hospitals,
the
record
is
the
designated
as
the
organization
which
will
coordinate
the
activities
of
all
other
organizations
including
the
salvation
army
–-
mr.
jack
s.
levin
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
with
regard
the
american
french
committee
and
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
whether
to
speak
to
that
subject.
i
can
tell
you
though
that
salvation
army
is
a
religious
organization.
it
has
been
called
the
“church”.
it
engages
in
much
religious
activity
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
it
is
not
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
it's
formed
under
state
law.
well,
that's
one
factor.
i
think
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
with
regard
to
all
other
organizations
with
the
uso
perhaps
been
the
only
other
organization
that
is
closed.
none
of
them
come
near
the
red
cross.
i
would
like
at
this
point,
however,
briefly
deal
with
some
of
the
services
of
the
red
cross
provides.
and,
of
course,
i
won't
get
through
all
of
it;
we
set
important
detail
on
our
brief.
for
example,
the
red
cross
provides
a
great
deal
of
a
day
to
day
activity,
hand
and
hand
with
the
military.
it
is
the
only
organization
which
is
designated
both
by
regulations,
extensive
regulations
promulgated
by
the
military
which
are
exhibits
to
this
case
by
presidential
order
and
various
other
instruments
that
carries
on
a
whole
series
of
investigations
and
activities
for
the
military.
one
example
is
that,
when
a
soldier
receives
a
letter
of
notification
that
his
some
member
of
his
family
is
ill
or
injured
or
has
died,
the
regular
procedure
is
to
refer
that
sort
of
recommendation
or
that
sort
of
a
question
to
the
red
cross.
the
red
cross
then,
through
military
communications
channels,
which
are
open
to
it,
contacts
their
local
chapter
in
that
area
who
makes
an
investigation
and
through
military
communication
channels
are
used
free
of
charged,
sends
the
reply
back
to
the
local
red
cross
man
at
the
scene
whether
it
be
vietnam
or
berlin
or
wherever.
he
turns
his
report
over
to
the
military
commander
who
then
uses
this
as
one
of
the
pieces
of
information
and
acting
on
a
request
for
compassionate
leave,
compassionate
discharge,
compassionate
transfer.
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
which
is
about
two
years
ago
or
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
the
number
of
communications
involved
in
this
sort
of
compassionate
request
for
running
a
2400
per
day.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
total
budget
of
the
red
cross
is
approximately
a
hundred
million
dollars.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
the
federal
government
does,
however,
provide
a
vast
volume
which
is
not
evaluated
in
money
terms.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
money.
the
red
cross
doesn't
receive
any
money
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
charges
for
their
services
never
exceed
cost,
for
example
when
they
supplied
blood,
they
charge
only
the
cost
not
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
my
position
would
not
be
exactly
the
same.
i
don't'
think
that
that
would
be
a
much
closer
question.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
in
the
first
place,
the
red
cross
does
not
actually
run
any
business
operation.
it
leases
out
a
few
building.
they
have
been
left
to
it.
in
the
second
place,
the
red
cross
takes
no
quarrel
with
property
taxes.—
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
one
or
two.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no
--
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
property
tax,
it
has
been
established
since
the
time
of
mcculloch
v.
maryland
that
a
state
may
impose
a
non-discriminatory
property
tax
on
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
should
think
that
an
income
tax
would
not
be
appropriate
and
would
probably
not,
will
not
in
issue
in
this
case.
i
should
then
think
that
income
tax
would
be
permissible.
this
incidentally
is
a
test
case,
as
the
record
shows
and
as
counsel
for
the
appellants
admits.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
would
like
to
summarize
in
the
last
minute
i
have
as
follows:
first
of
all,
the
acts
of
the
red
cross
are
voluntary.
it
contracts
with
the
government
like
other
organizations
to
perform
these
services;
no.
2,
congress
has
not
specifically
exempted
it,
their
speculation
as
to
what
they
might
have
done,
but
congress
has
not
so
acted.
other
organizations
of
this
type
are
now
covered
by
the
colorado
employment
security
act
and
the
fourth
point
is
that
the
purpose
the
colorado
security
act
in
taxing
non-profit
organizations
is
not
to
subsidize
the
rest
of
the
fund.
we
have
an
experience
rating
and
after
three
years,
if
it
has
a
good
ratio
of
unemployment,
it
would
be
released
from
a
tax
depending
the
amount
of
paid
in
and
the
amount
that
was
paid
out.
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
dealt
with
the
jurisdictional
issues
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
specific
questions,
but
if
there
are
none,
i
would
pass
on
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
american
national
red
cross,
the
organization
which
is
here
in
issue
is,
we
submit,
an
organization
which
is
formed
by
the
federal
government
and
which
performs
a
large
number
of
important
federal
duties
in
close
coordination
with
the
other
federal
agencies.
we
agree
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
argument
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
made.
the
employees
of
the
american
national
red
cross
are
not
the
employees
of
the
united
states,
any
more
than
the
employees
of
the
national
bank
are
the
employees
of
the
united
states,
but
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
lone
determinative
here.
we
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
operation
of
the
american
national
red
cross,
the
functions
it
performs,
the
degree
to
which
it
performs
them
in
close
coordination
with
the
united
states
and
the
extent
to
which
the
american
national
red
cross
is
provided
with
services,
facilities,
supplies,
etcetera
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
it
is
not
dispositive.
as
counsel
of
the
appellant
points
out
title
xxxvi
of
the
united
states
code
contains
the
charters
of
a
number
of
federally
incorporated
organizations.
the
congress,
of
course,
never
put
the
red
cross
as
charter
in
title
xxxvi,
the
revisers
did
and
congress
has
never
approved
that,
but
congress
has
recently
enacted
a
statute
that
we
think
is
helpful
in
this
regard
and
it's
not
mentioned
in
our
brief.
section
1101
of
title
xxxvi
provides
that
the
following
corporations,”
and
then
it
contains
a
list,
are
constituted
as
“private
corporations
established
under
federal
law,
private
corporations”.
it
uses
this
term
in
making
certain
requirement
that
they
be
audited
by
cpas
etcetera
and
in
listing
the
corporations
which
are
private
corporations
established
under
federal
law,
congress
listed
each
and
every
organization
within
title
xxxvi
with
four
exceptions;
three
of
them
are
commissions
wholly
financed
by
the
united
states
the
officers
of
which
are
wholly
appointed
either
by
the
president
or
office
of
the
united
states
government
regulating
battle
monuments
and
civil
wars,
centennials
and
things
like
that
and
the
only
other
organization
which
is
not
listed
there
is
the
american
national
red
cross.
before
1860,
it
was
not
uncommon
for
an
army
after
a
battle
to
retire
from
the
field,
to
regroup
and
press
on
the
battle
and
leave
it
wounded
and
sick
soldiers
on
the
field.
therefore,
in
1864
a
number
of
governments
convened
in
geneva
and
signed
what
is
the
first
geneva
convention.
that
convention,
for
the
first
time,
imposed
upon
the
member
governments,
the
requirement
and
the
duty
that
they
care
for
the
sick
and
wounded
of
both
sides
in
a
conflict,
both
their
own
and
their
enemies
and
they
authorized
each
member
government
to
form
a
red
cross
society,
a
national
red
cross
society.
the
united
states
became
a
party
to
that
treaty
in
about
1880
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
american
national
red
cross
was
formed.
in
1900,
congress
for
the
first
time
gave
it
a
national
charter.
now,
whatever
the
status
of
the
red
cross
was
up
until
that
time
and
beyond
up
until
1905,
we
submit
that
in
1905
an
act
which
congress
passed,
made
it
a
federal
instrumentality.
at
that
time,
congress
passed
what
is
referred
to
extensively
in
our
brief
as
the
act
of
1905.
it
dissolved
the
existing
red
cross
society
and
it
formed
what
is
now
the
american
national
red
cross,
the
charter
for
which
is
in
title
xxxvi.
it
gave
this
new
red
cross
society,
the
american
national
red
cross,
all
of
the
property
and
delegated
to
it
all
of
the
duties
and
the
word
“duties”
was
specifically
used,
of
the
old
red
cross
society
and
designated
it
the
new
american
national
red
cross
as
the
organization
which
is
to
perform
the
duties
of
the
united
states
government
under
the
geneva
convention
of
1864
and
any
future
convention
of
similar
nature
and
there
have
been
two:
1920
and
1949.
in
the
preamble
to
that
act,
the
1905
act,
congress
said
this.
“the
importance
of
the
work
of
the
red
cross
demands
a
repeal
of
the
present
charter
and
the
reincorporation
of
the
society
under
government
supervision”.
in
the
act
of
1905,
congress
gave
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
power
to
appoint
two-thirds
of
the
red
cross'
board
of
directors,
including
its
chairman.
it
provided
that
the
red
cross
was
to
be
audited
each
year
by
the
department
of
defense
and
the
war
department
and
that
the
red
cross
was
to
submit
audited
statements
both
the
detailed
report
of
its
proceedings
during
the
year
and
a
detailed
full
and
complete
itemized
account
of
its
receipts
and
expenditures.
now,
the
provision
regarding
receipts
and
expenditures
still
remains
and
each
year,
the
department
of
defense
performs
an
audit.
the
congress
subsequently
saw
fit
to
reduce
the
number
of
appointees
which
the
president
makes
to
the
red
cross'
board
to
less
than
the
majority.
but
as
congress
has
shown
in
some
more
recent
legislation,
specifically
a
1956
resolution
or
a
1952
committee
report,
it
still
regards
the
red
cross
as
adequately
supervised
by
the
federal
government
even
though
it
no
longer
has
a
majority
of
its
board
appointed
by
the
president.
and
i
think
that
the
remainder
of
my
argument
would
demonstrate
that
that
is
adequately
briefed.
in
the
act
of
1905,
congress
first
designated
the
red
cross
as
having
the
duty
to
perform
the
united
states'
obligations
under
the
geneva
conventions.
it
also
delegated
two
other
functions
to
the
red
cross,
both
of
which,
i
submit,
are
important
governmental
functions.
first
the
job
of
rendering
aid
to
the
military
services
of
the
united
states,
all
branches
of
the
armed
services;
and
second,
the
task
of
carrying
on
disaster
relief
in
case
of
national
disasters.
i
would
like
to
take
up
in
some
detail
each
of
these
three
functions
which
the
red
cross
has
since
1905
performed.
first
its
geneva
convention
duties;
these
might
include
such
duties
are
caring
for
or
supervising
the
care,
a
medical
care
given
to
captured
enemy
wounded.
it
might
include
the
inspection
of
facilities
afforded
for
either
american
troops
captured
by
the
enemy
or
given
to
enemy
troops
captured
by
the
united
states.
it
also
includes
the
arranging
of
communications
between
us
soldiers
in
enemy
prison
camps
and
their
families
at
home.
it
includes
the
transmitting
of
food
parcels
and
supplies,
medical
supplies,
clothing
from
the
united
states
to
our
troops
who
were
imprisoned
abroad.
for
example,
during
the
second
world
war,
the
red
cross
was
instrumental
in
arranging
and
through
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
transporting
to
american
troops
in
germany,
japan
approximately
30
million
parcels
over
the
course
of
that
four-year
conflict.
it
also
arranged
a
large
number
of
communications
back
and
forth
between
families
of
us
servicemen
captured
abroad
and
those
servicemen.
all
of
these
activities,
of
course,
require
the
closest
coordination
between
the
american
national
red
cross
and
the
american
department
of
defense
and
to
some
extent,
the
state
department
because
contacts
with
foreign
governments
both
directly
and
through
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
are
certainly
of
interest
to
this
government.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
submit
first
of
all
that
it
is
an
implied
exemption
from
the
constitution
that
when
congress
creates
an
organization,
gives
that
important
federal
functions
to
perform,
arranges
for
to
do
so
in
close
coordination
with
the
united
states
executive
agencies
including
the
military,
state
department
and
when
it
provides
some
financial
support
for
it
and
takes
all
the
steps,
which
it
has
done
with
regard
the
american
national
red
cross,
that
the
constitution
grants
it
an
immunity
just
as
this
court
held
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
with
regard
to
the
original
bank
of
the
united
states
which,
of
course,
was
80%
owned
by
private
shareholders
and
the
20%
by
the
united
states
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
think
that
the
constitution
is
sufficient
to
achieve
the
purpose
which
we
are
here
discussing.
i
think,
however,
that
if
this
court
would
have
find
for
some
reason,
which
i
cannot
at
this
time
conceive,
that
the
constitution
is
not
sufficient
that
the
statutes
here
in
question
would
affirmatively
grant
an
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
shouldn't
think
that
if
an
organization
did
5%
of
its
work
in
close
coordination
with
the
government
and
95%
of
its
work
privately
that
it
would
become
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
i
should
think,
however,
that
the
facts
show,
as
i
will
endeavor
to
prove
here,
that
the
red
cross
is
not
in
the
category
of
organizations
which
you
have
described.
the
red
cross
doesn't
give
an
incidental
amount
of
its
effort
to
cooperate
with
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
for
what
might
you
said
that
it
is
partially
tax
exempt,
the
salaries
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
certainly
think
that
would
be
conceivable
solution
that
congress
could
enact.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
present
statute
do
enact
that
sort
of
the
solution.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
i
rely
on
the
constitution
and
the
statute
would
have
nothing
but
a
negative
effect,
a
waiver
of
the
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
had
been
no
of
such
cases
that
i
know
of
reaching
that
conclusion.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
an
inconceivable
result.
certainly,
that
result
could
be
reached
and
i
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
that
is
the
result
this
court
reaches,
then
not
5%
but
99.5%
of
the
red
cross'
activities
would
be
covered.
and
that
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
my
position
is
that
you
need
not
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
the
red
cross'
activities
as
i
will
demonstrate
are
99%
or
95%
directed
towards
achieving
its
federal
duties
and
that
many
of
the
things
which
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i'm
talking
about
worldwide.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
record
has
very
little
in
it
about
any
specific
activities
within
colorado.
the
record
has
a
great
deal
in
it
about
the
general
activities
of
the
red
cross
and
the
purpose
for
which
the
local
activities
take
place.
for
example,
if
you're
referring
to
blood
collection
drives
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
would
try
to
answer
your
question
this
way.
i
would
ask
your
indulgence
to
pass
on
to
the
next
point
i've
got
here
and
then
come
back
to
it
because
my
next
point
is,
many
of
the
activities
which
the
red
cross
performs
for
the
military
and
in
disaster
relief
which
require
the
existence
of
state
and
local
chapters
and
the
way
in
which
those
state
and
local
chapters
are
integrated
into
a
nationwide
and
even
a
worldwide
network
which
are
absolutely
essential
for
the
performance
of
the
red
cross'
duties.
i
would
find
your
question
very
difficult
were
this
not
the
fact.
certainly,
if
there
was
no
one
with
any
given
state
performing
any
federal
duties
or
any
federal
functions,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
the
employees
within
that
state
couldn't
be
taxed.
but
i
submit
that
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
think
we
do
have
record
of
evidence.
we
have
testimony
among
other
things
from
the
mid
west
region
manager
of
the
red
cross
which
includes
colorado
and
he
talked
in
here
about
the
services
which
are
performed
in
the
mid
west
region
and
in
general
about
the
services
which
the
chapters
performed.
he
did
not
say,
“this
colorado
chapter
performs
this
service”.
the
inference
is
there,
it's
pregnant.
in
every
sentence
he
says
that
he
is
not
trying
to
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
would
take
the
position
that
it's
either
one
way
or
another,
yes.
i
could
conceive
of
this
court
reaching
a
different
result
but
i
don't
think
it's
warranted
either
by
the
facts
or
by
the
law
or
by
the
cases
this
court
has
decided.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
in
that
case,
it
could
become
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
and
it
would
depend
on
the
facts,
such
as
the
facts
i'm
here
discussing.
one
point
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
of
course,
not.
but
if
the
government
created
a
new
corporation
to
be
engaged
in
ship
building
and
this
organization
was
a
non-profit
corporation,
some
of
the
officers
of
which
were
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
which
the
united
states
supplied
a
great
deal
of
aid
to
in
the
form
of
supplies
and
services
and
personnel,
transportation,
communication,
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
services
annually
and
this
organization
then
built
ships
solely
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
government
and
naval
officers
were
working
in
that
shipyard
hand
in
hand
with
the
other
employees
of
this
non-profit
corporation,
i
think
that
on
those
facts,
it
would
be
very
likely
that
that
corporation
would
become
an
arm
of
the
federal
government
just
as
this
court
held
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
because
i
think
this
court
has
traditionally
held
over
the
years
that
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver
where
the
organization
is,
as
i've
described
it,
it
has
by
force
of
the
constitution
itself
a
portion
of
the
united
states'
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
by
force
of
the
constitution.
in
the
clallam
county
case
decided
by
this
court
a
few
years
ago
involving
a
government
corporation
formed
to
build
not
ships
but
their
airplanes
for
world
war
i
which
was
a
non-profit
organization
staffed
by
the
government
people
at
the
high
levels
and
the
executive
positions,
this
court
held
that
it
had
an
immunity.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
that
would
be
one
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
a
profit
making
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
i've
been
using
those
two
terms
as
meaning
the
same
thing.
let
me
define
them
further.
when
i
say
“constitutionally
exempt”,
i
mean
exempt
by
the
force
of
the
constitution
without
congress
saying
a
word,
but
congress
can
waive
that
exemption.
it
has
implied
constitutional
exemption
and
that's
just
what
the
court
said
in
the
clallam
county
case.
this
court
said
that
the
immunity
is
derived
from
the
constitution
in
the
same
sense
and
upon
the
same
principle
that
it
would
be
of
expressed
in
so
many
words.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
could
be.
this
court
so
held
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
with
regard
to
the
bank
of
the
united
states
which
was
a
profit
making
corporation,
80%
owned
by
private
shareholders.
it
could
be
but
i
think
that
that's
one
factor
to
be
considered.
this
court
would
be
much
less
likely
to
conclude
that
a
given
organization,
if
it
were
a
profit-making
organization.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
on
the
constitutional
basis.
the
united
states
doesn't
typically
form
profit-making
organizations
and
make
them
instrumentalities
tax
exempt.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
this
colorado
tax?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it's
unemployment
compensation
tax.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
used
partially
to
pay
an
employment
compensation
benefits
to
the
employees
of
the
particular
employer
who
has
been
discharged.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
record
doesn't
speak
on
that.
but
i
say
that
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
that
in
two
steps.
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
the
state
of
colorado
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
the
red
cross,
directly
in
proportion
to
the
benefits
which
its
employees
received.
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
the
state
of
colorado
sought
the
tax
and
didn't
back
tax
the
red
cross
over
$28,000
in
the
3
½
years
in
colorado
that
this
suit
was
in
progress.
it
paid
out
during
that
period
$404
in
benefits
to
red
cross
employees,
a
ratio
of
$1
benefits
for
$70
of
tax
collected.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
it
goes
to
the
very
nature
of
the
tax.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
congress
in
1966
considered
a
bill
to
specifically
deal
with
this
point.
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
deal
--
replay
with
just
a
couple
of
the
items
that
were
raised
before
lunch
and
then
hopefully
to
spend
the
last
three
or
four
minutes
on
the
activities
of
the
red
cross,
it
is
our
position,
first
of
all,
that
if
the
red
cross
is,
as
we
contend
exempt
from
state
taxation
that
that
would
include
any
type
of
tax
on
the
red
cross'
operations
as
what
this
court
said
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
that's
what
this
court
has
reiterated
in
perhaps
in
dozen
decisions
and
this
would
include
the
tax
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
employing
individuals.
now,
congress
recognized
when
it
enacted
the
social
security
amendments
of
1960
that
this
was
the
result.
we
submit
that
congress
had
a
very
good
reason
for
waiving
red
cross
exempt
from
state
unemployment
compensation
tax.
this
reason
is
demonstrated
by
the
recent
bill
that
came
within
a
hair
of
passage
in
the
1966
congress.
both
houses
passed
it
but
they
failed
to
resolve
a
few
minor
inconsistencies
in
conference.
that
bill
submitted
all
charities,
including
the
red
cross
although
not
by
name,
all
charities
to
state
taxation
and
required
all
states
to
impose
unemployment
compensation
taxes
on
them
but
specifically
required
that
those
taxes
be
in
direct
proportion
to
the
benefits
paid
out
to
the
employees
and
congress
in
the
extensive
committee
reports
and
hearings
that
held
on
those
bills
recognized
that
charitable
organizations
have
a
much
lower
turnover
rate
in
employee,
in
personnel
than
do
most
industrial
concerns.
and,
therefore,
congress
took
the
position
that
some
states
in
colorado
was
specifically
mentioned
as
we
set
forth
in
our
briefs
in
this
hearings,
some
states
have
been
taxing
charitable
corporations
in
such
a
manner
that
the
income
from
the
charitable
corporations
is
used
to
subsidize
the
benefits
paid
out
to
employees
of
industrial
concerns.
they
do
not
give
them
adequate
recognition
for
their
excellent
employee
and
employment
records.
second,
with
regards
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
we
submit
that
where
an
organization
is
predominantly
as
is
this
one,
engaged
in
governmental
activities
in
the
entire
national
organization
is
a
–
pointed
in
this
direction
and
intended
for
this
purpose
that
whether
or
not
a
given
individual
chapter
may
engage
in
more
or
less
governmental
activity
is
not
the
issue.
we
also
submit
that
there
is
some
evidence
on
the
record
supporting
those
colorado
activities,
not
just
mid
west
region.
for
example,
there
is
a
discussion
by
the
mid
west
regional
direct
of
the
activities
at
fit
simons
army
hospital
and
that
institution
is
in
colorado.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
don't
mean
in
any
way
to
deprecate
any
of
the
activities
carried
on
by
these
many
fine
organizations
but
the
red
cross
is
the
only
organization
which
is
created
by
active
congress,
heavily
supported
by
federal
contributions
of
services
and
supplies
and
activities,
a
number
of
the
directors
of
which
are
appointed
by
congress
which
has
imposed
upon
it
federal
treaty
duties,
federal
duties
in
disasters,
federal
duties
with
regard
to
aiding
the
military.
many
of
the
other
organizations
such
as
the
salvation
army
of
the
us
owned
do
perform
some
such
functions.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
the
uso
is
perhaps
the
closest
organization
to
the
red
cross
but
no
other
organization
comes,
i
should
to
say,
within
a
country
mile
of
the
red
cross.
the
salvation
army,
for
example,
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
the
appellant
said,
the
record
demonstrates
over
and
over
again
that
the
salvation
armies
activities
in
this
regard
are
much
less
in
extent
that
those
of
the
red
cross
and
that
in
most
federal
institutions
including
all
military
hospitals,
the
record
is
the
designated
as
the
organization
which
will
coordinate
the
activities
of
all
other
organizations
including
the
salvation
army
–-
mr.
jack
s.
levin
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
with
regard
the
american
french
committee
and
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
whether
to
speak
to
that
subject.
i
can
tell
you
though
that
salvation
army
is
a
religious
organization.
it
has
been
called
the
“church”.
it
engages
in
much
religious
activity
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
it
is
not
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
it's
formed
under
state
law.
well,
that's
one
factor.
i
think
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
with
regard
to
all
other
organizations
with
the
uso
perhaps
been
the
only
other
organization
that
is
closed.
none
of
them
come
near
the
red
cross.
i
would
like
at
this
point,
however,
briefly
deal
with
some
of
the
services
of
the
red
cross
provides.
and,
of
course,
i
won't
get
through
all
of
it;
we
set
important
detail
on
our
brief.
for
example,
the
red
cross
provides
a
great
deal
of
a
day
to
day
activity,
hand
and
hand
with
the
military.
it
is
the
only
organization
which
is
designated
both
by
regulations,
extensive
regulations
promulgated
by
the
military
which
are
exhibits
to
this
case
by
presidential
order
and
various
other
instruments
that
carries
on
a
whole
series
of
investigations
and
activities
for
the
military.
one
example
is
that,
when
a
soldier
receives
a
letter
of
notification
that
his
some
member
of
his
family
is
ill
or
injured
or
has
died,
the
regular
procedure
is
to
refer
that
sort
of
recommendation
or
that
sort
of
a
question
to
the
red
cross.
the
red
cross
then,
through
military
communications
channels,
which
are
open
to
it,
contacts
their
local
chapter
in
that
area
who
makes
an
investigation
and
through
military
communication
channels
are
used
free
of
charged,
sends
the
reply
back
to
the
local
red
cross
man
at
the
scene
whether
it
be
vietnam
or
berlin
or
wherever.
he
turns
his
report
over
to
the
military
commander
who
then
uses
this
as
one
of
the
pieces
of
information
and
acting
on
a
request
for
compassionate
leave,
compassionate
discharge,
compassionate
transfer.
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
which
is
about
two
years
ago
or
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
the
number
of
communications
involved
in
this
sort
of
compassionate
request
for
running
a
2400
per
day.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
total
budget
of
the
red
cross
is
approximately
a
hundred
million
dollars.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
the
federal
government
does,
however,
provide
a
vast
volume
which
is
not
evaluated
in
money
terms.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
money.
the
red
cross
doesn't
receive
any
money
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
charges
for
their
services
never
exceed
cost,
for
example
when
they
supplied
blood,
they
charge
only
the
cost
not
–
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
my
position
would
not
be
exactly
the
same.
i
don't'
think
that
that
would
be
a
much
closer
question.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
in
the
first
place,
the
red
cross
does
not
actually
run
any
business
operation.
it
leases
out
a
few
building.
they
have
been
left
to
it.
in
the
second
place,
the
red
cross
takes
no
quarrel
with
property
taxes.—
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
one
or
two.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no
--
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
property
tax,
it
has
been
established
since
the
time
of
mcculloch
v.
maryland
that
a
state
may
impose
a
non-discriminatory
property
tax
on
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
should
think
that
an
income
tax
would
not
be
appropriate
and
would
probably
not,
will
not
in
issue
in
this
case.
i
should
then
think
that
income
tax
would
be
permissible.
this
incidentally
is
a
test
case,
as
the
record
shows
and
as
counsel
for
the
appellants
admits.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
would
like
to
summarize
in
the
last
minute
i
have
as
follows:
first
of
all,
the
acts
of
the
red
cross
are
voluntary.
it
contracts
with
the
government
like
other
organizations
to
perform
these
services;
no.
2,
congress
has
not
specifically
exempted
it,
their
speculation
as
to
what
they
might
have
done,
but
congress
has
not
so
acted.
other
organizations
of
this
type
are
now
covered
by
the
colorado
employment
security
act
and
the
fourth
point
is
that
the
purpose
the
colorado
security
act
in
taxing
non-profit
organizations
is
not
to
subsidize
the
rest
of
the
fund.
we
have
an
experience
rating
and
after
three
years,
if
it
has
a
good
ratio
of
unemployment,
it
would
be
released
from
a
tax
depending
the
amount
of
paid
in
and
the
amount
that
was
paid
out.
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you
very
much.
