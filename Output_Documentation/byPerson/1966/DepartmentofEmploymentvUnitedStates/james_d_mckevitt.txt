mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
this
is
a
direct
from
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
united
stated
district
court
in
and
for
the
district
of
colorado.
there
are
three
questions
presented
to
this
court.
no.
1
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
in
the
subject
matter
to
this
action;
the
second
question
is
whether
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
or
agency,
and
i
use
the
words
interchangeably,
of
the
united
states
government;
and
the
third
question
is
if
the
court
finds
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government,
has
congress
waived
its
immunity
from
taxation
by
its
1960
amendments
to
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
which
became
effective,
january
1962.
this
action
arose,
and
i
go
on
way
of
background,
that
because
of
the
proviso
of
the
amendment
to
the
colorado
employment
security
act
which
is
set
forth
in
chapter
82,
1963
crs
(colorado
revised
statutes)
which
taxes
all
non-profit
organizations
in
the
state
of
colorado.
for
example,
we
tax
hospitals,
churches;
there
are
clerical
exemptions,
etcetera
but
other
organizations
such
as
the
salvation
army,
the
colorado
bar
association,
etcetera,
are
covered
under
the
colorado
employment
security
act.
colorado
is
one
of
three
states
which
taxes
non-profit
corporations
under
its
colorado
employment
security
act.
the
other
two
states
are
alaska
and
hawaii.
now
two
of
these
states,
namely:
colorado
and
alaska
elected
to
tax
the
american
national
red
cross
under
the
employment
security
acts
and
as
a
result,
this
action
was
brought
in
the
colorado
district
court,
united
stated
district
court,
seeking
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
colorado
department
of
employment
and
its
executive
director,
bernardi
tist,
from
assessing
further
taxes
against
the
american
national
red
cross.
the
department
of
employment
appeared
and
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
and
moved
to
strike
the
united
states
of
america
as
a
party-plaintiff
to
this
action
and
the
appellee
moved
for
a
summary
judgment.
these
matters
were
argued
to
a
three-judge
court
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
upon
hearing
of
oral
arguments,
the
united
state
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
granted
our
motion
to
strike
the
united
states
government
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
failed
to
state
an
adequate
claim
for
relief.
then,
the
matter
was
heard
on
its
merits
and
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
united
states
district
court
so
ruled
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
they
reinstated
the
united
states
as
a
party-plaintiff
on
this
matter
and
this
matter
is
now
on
appeal
to
this
court
on
a
direct
appeal.
now,
directing
my
argument
to
these
three
issues,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
argument
primarily
first
of
all
to
the
second
question
because
it
has
near
relation
to
question
no.
1.
we
submit
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
not
an
instrumentality
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
it
is
a
creature
of
congress
under
title
xxxvi
and
so
is
the
boy
scouts,
there
is
the
american
revolution,
the
american
historical
society,
reference
of
foreign
works,
etcetera.
but
congress
has
manifested
and
expressed
intent
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government.
in
fact,
looking
at
the
act
itself
in
title
xxxvi
and
referring
also
to
title
x,
congress
conveys
fact
that
this
is
a
private
organization
rendering
voluntary
assistance
to
the
united
states
government
when
it
is
requested
to
do
so.
now,
under
title
x,
for
example,
there
are
two
provisos
in
there
which
i
think
are
significant
in
construing
the
legal
status
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
one
is
the
fact
that
refers
to
the
power
of
the
president
to
accept
the
assistance
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
it
never
speaks
about
a
duty
for
the
american
national
red
cross
to
comply
with
federal
request.
in
fact,
all
of
these
matters
in
which
the
red
cross
assists
the
united
states
government
are
bilateral
agreements
and
of
a
voluntary
nature.
the
second
matter,
which
is
of
importance
in
title
x
is
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
provided
in
section
2602
(e)
that
red
cross
employee
should
not
be
considered
as
federal
employee
or
employees
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
there
are
--
in
other
--
in
actions
in
the
past,
some
of
which
i
do
not
submit
as
precedent,
and
i’m
sure
counsel
for
the
other
side
would
not
as
submit
as
precedent,
there
are
ceremonies
of
proclamations
by
former
presidents
of
the
united
states
which
say
that,
“it
is
a
quasi
organization
or
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states
government”.
on
the
other
hand,
the
secretary
of
labor
in
1944
passed
a
regulation
stating
that
red
cross
and
salvation
army
were
not
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
government.
internal
revenue
code
has
made
rulings
on
this
matter,
but
congress
has
spoken
once
again
in
title
xlii
under
the
national
disaster
act.
and,
of
course,
one
of
the
roles
of
the
american
national
red
cross,
it
has
four-fold
purposes:
one,
is
to
assist
the
armed
forces;
two,
is
to
give
disaster
relief;
three,
is
to
conduct
fund
appeals
and
four,
is
to
interpret
the
red
cross
to
the
local
community
and
these
are
brought
out
by
the
testimony
on
page
100
of
the
record.
but
one
of
their
--
as
their
assistance
to
the
armed
forces
or,
excuse
me,
under
the
--
so
far
as
the
national
disaster
is
concerned
under
the
title
xlii,
under
the
national
disaster
act,
it
specifically
provides
in
defining
federal
agencies
that
the
american
national
read
cross
shall
not
be
considered
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
looking
to
the
charter
so
to
speak
for
the
enabling
statute
for
the
american
red
cross,
there
are
other
manifestations
of
congress
which
show
that
the
united
states
has
not
exerted
a
power
or
a
controlling
power
over
the
american
national
red
cross.
for
one,
the
president
has
the
power
to
appoint
8
to
a
board
of
50
members.
in
of
this,
none
fit
into
the
executive
committee.
then
the
act
refers
to
voluntary
relief,
voluntary
assistance
etcetera
and
then
once
again
and
by
previous
actions
of
the
red
cross,
and
by
the
evidence
in
the
record
it
shows
that
these
are
agreements
where
they
meet,
they
enter
into
a
bilateral
agreement
and
they
carry
these
matters
up.
the
red
cross
would
point
out
that
they
are
the
sole
agent
who
disperses
problems
or
supplies
in
times
of
disaster
and
yet
the
salvation
army
has
brought
up,
by
the
evidence
also,
renders
valuable
assistance
even
though
they
may
not
be
the
recognized
dispersing
authority.
the
salvation
army
plays
just
as
important
role
so
far
as
the
national
disasters
are
concerned
and
yet,
the
salvation
army
is
taxed
under
the
colorado
employment
security
act.
it
does
not
rule
itself
out
as
an
instrumentality
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
only
the
power
to
accept
the
assistance
of
the
red
cross
in
other
words,
and
i
submit
that
that
red
cross
works
only
in
a
private
sector
and
not
a
public
sector.
this
was
brought
out
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
dermet
(ph),
who
was
former
director
of
the
office
of
the
emergency
planning
and
his
testimony
is
set
forth
in
folios
or
pages
79
and
86
of
the
record.
so
in
essence,
the
red
cross
gives
voluntary
relief
to
private
needs
and
from
private
funds.
now,
another
interesting
facet
--
is
the
fact
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
one
of
various
national
organizations
which
belongs
to
the
international
red
cross
conference.
and
as
brought
out
also
in
the
testimony
on
the
record,
the
international
red
cross
conference,
which
is
worldwide,
requires
in
its
charter
that
its
member
organizations
remain
autonomous,
by
that
i
mean
that
they
remain
autonomous
from
the
government
with
which
it
works.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
role
of
the
american
national
red
cross
is
a
noble
one
and
a
humanitarian
one.
and
the
interesting
part
of
the
testimony
is
the
fact
that
it's
not
national
humanitarian;
it's
international
humanitarianism.
in
other
words,
as
brought
out
by
the
testimony,
they
assist
armed
forces
of
enemy
countries
as
well
as
those
of
our
country.
so
they
have
this
international
humanitarian
scheme.
of
course,
the
salvation
army
renders
the
same
service.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
mr.
justice
fortas,
my
answer
to
that
is
title
x
or,
excuse
me,
title
xxii
and
that
is
this:
that
congress
has
set
forth
a
great
number
or
many
more
controls
over
the
instrument
of
national
banks.
they
have
the
power
to
pass
on
their
mergers,
appoint
receivers,
to
pass
on
the
or
approve
on
the
stock
that
they
issue
and
that
brief
–
they
would
take
--
there
are
number
ones
which
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
but
they
explicitly
have
(voice
overlap)
much
more
authority.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
in
title
xxii.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
for
example
the
inside
operation
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
yes
it's
true
that
they
do
have
their
national
headquarters
here
on
the
united
states
government
land
and
interestingly
enough,
the
next
building
to
the
south
is
the
daughters
of
the
american
revolution.
but
at
the
same
time,
let's
go
to
the
trade
michigan
where
they
have
a
commercial
building
which
they
operate
for
a
profit
which
the
money
goes
back
into
the
operation
of
the
national
red
cross.
let's
take
for
example
the
fact
that
through
out
the
country,
they
retain
private
legal
counsel.
they
have
a
private
public
accounting
firm.
they
have
two
audits
every
year
and
one
is
conducted
at
their
expense
by
asking
themselves
certified
public
accountants
and
the
other
is
conducted
by
the
department
of
defense
and
they
are
required
to
reimburse
the
department
of
defense
for
the
audit.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
checks
that
the
united
states
government
makes
upon,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
interesting
point
is
that
the
united
states
government
does
not
give
them
any
money.
in
fact,
the
red
cross
over
the
years
has
prided
themselves
on
the
fact
that
they
receive
no
money
from
the
united
states
government.
the
red
cross
does
not
have
a
title
so
to
speak
in
the
american
national
red
cross
and
in
fact,
looking
at
their
motor
vehicles,
they
are
titled
in
the
name
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
through
out
the
states,
they
have
--
they
title
their
vehicles
in
their
respective
state
registration
requirements.
there
are
nurses
who
are
subject
to
local
and
state
registrations
and
they
subject
themselves
to
withholding
tax,
for
example,
in
the
state
of
colorado
and
another
states.
these
matters
are
also
set
forth
in
the
record.
now,
counsel
points
out
this
case
of
standard
oil
versus
johnson,
which
this
case
is
previously
entered
as
decision
in
316
us
and
which
is
set
forth
in
both
briefs
and,
i
think
that
that
case
is
not
controlling
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
in
fact,
i
think,
it
is
easily
distinguished.
in
that
case,
we
talked
about
an
army
post
exchange,
a
situation
or
a
post
exchange
that
was
run
by
a
member
of
the
military
service
where
the
money
is
originally
appropriated
from
the
treasury
to
run
the
post
exchange
where
salaries
are
paid
by
the
united
states
government
for
employees
to
run
this
and
in
the
event
that
it
closes
up,
the
reversion
of
profits
or
balance
goes
back
to
the
treasury.
i
submit
another
or
in
fact
a
better
test
insofar
is
the
question
on
these
matter
is
concerned
is
the
case
of
unemployment
compensation
commission
of
north
carolina
versus
wachovia
bank
and
trust,
this
is
north
carolina
case
which
is
set
forth
on
my
brief.
and
in
there,
the
court,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
stated
five
elements
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
government
instrumentality
or
agency.
one
was,
did
the
government
create
it?
well,
that's
applicable
here.
no.
2,
is
that
wholly
owned
by
the
government?
this
is
not
true
here
because
it
is
not
even
partially
owned
by
the
government.
three,
was
it
operated
for
profit?
well,
this
would
be
applicable
here,
the
red
cross
is
a
non-profit
organization.
is
it
engaged
primarily
in
the
governmental
function
is
the
forth
test
and
we
submit,
the
evidence
was
substantiated,
that
this
is
not
their
primary
function.
this
is
one
of
their
functions,
but
this
is
not
their
major
function.
and
the
fifth
and
most
important
test
is
whether
the
proposed
tax
such
as
the
colorado
employment
security
act
tax,
which
would
come
out
of
that
act,
would
that
impose
an
economic
burden
on
the
government
of
the
united
states?
and
i
submit
that
this
would
not
be
the
case.
the
united
states
government
would
not
be
subject
to
this
tax
or
would
it
create
a
burden
on
the
united
states
government
in
this
regard.
and
this
comes
to
–
one
of
the
key
issues,
i
think
the
point
is,
that
the
reason
the
instrumentality
exemption
is
set
forth
is
to
prevent
a
burden,
undue
burden
on
the
united
states
government.
there
would
be
no
tax
imposed.
the
united
states
government
would
not
be
obligated
in
anyway
for
the
payment
of
this
tax
and
for
such
reason
i
think
that
that's
the
key
test
along
with
the
other
onus
in
the
wachovia
case
to
show
that
red
cross
does
not
qualify
as
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
i've
already
pointed
out
the
four
functions
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
case,
that's
miller
versus
city
of
greenbelt
and
in
that
–
it
cites
also
grace
versus
new
york,
306
us
466.
in
the
language
of
the
court
there,
i'm
referring
to
grace
versus
new
york,
says
that,
“when
the
national
government
lawfully
acts
through
a
corporation
which
it
owns
and
controls,
those
activities
are
governmental
functions
entitled
to
tax
immunity”.
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
concluding
on
this
particular
point,
i
think
that
the
status
of
the
red
cross
is
best
defined
by
mr.
basal
o'conner,
who
was
national
chairman
of
the
american
national
red
cross
in
1946
and
this
is
set
forth
in
his
quotation
in
the
appellee's-plaintiff
exhibit
“8”
--
“18”
which
is
the
1946
american
annual
or
american
red
cross
annual
report.
mr.
o'conner
stated
“the
international
red
cross
committee
has
always
maintained
that
the
national
societies,
while
cooperating
closely
with
their
own
government
and
with
other
agencies
but
at
the
same
time
remain
independent.
this
explains
to
a
certain
extent
the
unique
position
of
the
american
red
cross
in
the
light
of
the
country.
cooperating
closely
with
the
government
it
is
in
no
sense
a
part
of
the
government.
working
hand
in
hand
with
many
agencies,
it
still
retains
its
freedom
of
action.
and
now,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
address
my
next
remark
issue
no.
1
and
that
is
the
jurisdiction
so
far
as
the
united
states
district
court
is
concerned.
first
of
all
–
sir?
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
going
to
answer
that
question,
my
third
argument
but
i'll
answer
briefly
now.
i
have
submitted
on
page
41
of
my
brief
three
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
feel
would
defeat
any
significance
to
be
given
by
that
testimony
or
statements
by
members
and
committee
because
of
the
fact,
if
that
was
such
a
vital
concern,
congress
had
the
power
to
expressly
exempt
the
american
national
red
cross
from
coverage
under
the
1960
amendment.
and
the
1960
amendment
makes
specific
language
which
specifically
exempts
only
certain
organizations
or
a
certain
type
of
organization.
and,
i
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
aldridge
case,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case,
in
the
united
states
versus
trade
association
that
this
could
not
be
given
construction
in
determining
the
intent
of
congress.
does
it
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
alright,
sir.
so
far
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
us
district
court
in
denver's
concern,
your
honors,
we
based
our
objection
and
feel
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
should
have
applied
in
this
regard
in
that
the
us
district
court
should
have
refused
to
accept
jurisdiction
of
the
matter
because
of
title
xxviii,
section
1351
which
as
your
honor
is
well
aware
provides
that
the
courts
shall
not
enjoin
the
assessment
of
state
taxes
when
the
relief
may
be
had
in
state
courts.
now,
we
submit
that
the
united
states
or
should
i
say
(inaudible)
that
the
american
national
red
cross
had
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
denver
district
court
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
82
article
ix
and
section
9
of
the
1963
and
then
the
1953
colorado
revised
statutes.
they
simply
had
to
ask
for
a
refund,
have
an
objection
applied
or
refusal
thereto
and
immediately
file
suit
in
the
denver
district
court
for
an
interpretation
or
for
a
judicial
ruling
on
their
entitlement
or
non-entitlement
to
a
refund
under
the
colorado
employment
security
act.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
were.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
i
think
that
it
touches
upon
a
gray
area
because
they
touch
–
they
mentioned
first
of
all
the
arlington
case
and
the
livingstone
case.
now,
those
cases
don't
just
give
unqualified
authority
on
applicability
or
non-applicability
of
1341
whether
is
the
united
states
named
as
a
party
because
in
the
arlington
case,
they
refer
to
it
not
being
applicable
where
the
united
states
has
the
proprietary
function.
and
this
was
a
case
where
bottomly,
a
naval
officer
his
taxes
were
involved.
the
livingstone
case
referred
to
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
has
a
pecuniary
interest.
and
i
submit,
perhaps
that
this
is
a
fine
point,
but
i
submit
that
in
neither
of
these
cases,
that
the
united
states
have
a
proprietary
interest
or
a
pecuniary
interest.
in
fact,
they
did
not
even
allege
in
their
complaint
nor
did
they
prove
it.
the
unique
part
is
that
they
were
dismissed
throughout
the
trial
and
then
they
reinstated
at
the
end
of
the
trial
from
the
motion
to
strike.
and
for
such
reason,
i
submit
that
the
arlington
and
the
livingstone
case,
although
being
warm
on
the
subject,
are
not
absolute
authority
for
this
premise.
i
would
also
point
out
the
fact
that
proprietary
insofar
as
webster
is
concerned,
is
one
who
has
exclusive
title
or
ownership
in
something
and
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
with
the
united
states
government.
now,
there
a
question
also
arises
that
would
they
have
an
adequate
and
speedy
remedy
at
law?
there's
no
doubt
the
united
states
has
presented
cases
here
which
have
merit
upon
this
point,
but
there
are
also
cases
to
the
contrary.
and,
i
submit
that
--
of
course,
i
will
submit
that
these
cases;
one
of
them
is
the
toomer
versus
witsell
case,
the
previous
decision
of
this
court
and
i
submit
that
matthews
versus
rogers,
although
it's
not
the
case
in
point,
has
language
which
has
significance
as
to
the
reasoning
behind
it.
and,
i
cite
the
washington
case
of
state
versus
police
court
of
seattle
and
they
say
there
is
not
a
general
rule;
it
depends
upon
the
facts.
the
interesting
point
of
this
case
is
the
us
district
court
made
no
ruling
on
the
question
of
interest
so
that
they
say
they
were
not
entitled
to
interest
on
the
refund.
that's
as
far
as
they
went.
and,
i
question
the
logic
of
--
and
perhaps
this
is
through
my
ignorance,
your
honors,
but
why
this
would
have
so
much
bearing
so
far
as
the
awarding
of
interest
is
concerned
on
a
plain
and
adequate
and
speedy
remedy
at
law.
because
the
main
thing
is,
as
the
washington
case
points
out
and
also
the
matthews
versus
rogers
decision
of
this
court,
it
goes
into
a
much
greater
significance
so
far
as
the
reasonable
remedies
which
they
have.
for
example,
one
of
the
cases
that
talks
about
-
i
think
it's
the
matthews
case,
that
talks
about
where
there
were
four
hearings
involved
instead
of
two
and
they
said
that
regardless
to
that
fact
that
there
would
still
be
--
this
would
not
deprive
them
of
a
speedy
and
adequate
remedy.
now
the
toomer
case
for
example
is
where
the
georgia
fishermen
sought
to
enjoin
the
south
carolina
tax
commission
for
taxing
for
fishing
in
south
carolina
territory
and
in
that
case,
there
was
no
discussion
about
refund
one
way
or
the
other,
but
there's
no
language
by
the
court
to
show
that
a
refund
of
interest
would
have
been
paid
and
yet,
this
court
held
that
there
was
jurisdiction
there
in
the
state
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
answer
lastly
the
third
question
and
that
is,
if
this
court
is
to
rule
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government,
has
congress
waived
its
immunity?
and
in
doing
so,
i'd
like
to
go
into
background
once
again
and
that
is
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
which
is
set
forth
in
title
xxvi,
section
3301
in
sequence,
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
i
think
has
to
be
understood
from
its
basic
roots
to
understand
what
congress
did
in
1960
and
that
has
thrown
exception
in
the
1930s.
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
was
set
up
as
a
sort
of
a
guideline
to
the
states
saying
that
you
will
pass
laws
if
you
wish
to
tax
in
your
states,
certain
employers
but
we
will
provide
minimum
standards.
they
used
to
be,
for
example,
eight
or
more
employees
for
a
period
of
20
weeks.
now,
one
of
the
minimum
standards
is
four
more
employees
for
20
calendar
weeks
in
one
year.
and
so
they
set
forth
these
minimum
standards
and
the
states
go
along
and
they
have
different
discretions
on
certain
matters.
for
example,
alaska,
colorado
and
hawaii
tax
non-profits;
the
rest
of
them
do
not.
congress
has
not
stated
that
you
have
to
tax
non-profits,
but
they
say
--
they
don't
also
say
that
you
cannot,
excuse
me
--
they
don't
say
that
you
can't
tax
non-profit
organizations.
so
this
is
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
states,
but
the
reason
3306
(c)
(6)
of
title
xxvi
comes
into
play
here
is
the
fact
that
congress
has
made
it
very
clear
that
they
don't
want
the
states
to
tax
federal
employees
because
they
are
already
covered
by
the
united
states
government.
in
other
words,
civil
service
employees
of
the
united
states
government
are
covered
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
and
when
a
person
is
laid
off
or
has
a
claim
for
unemployment
benefits,
he
files
a
claim
and
the
claim
is
filed
through
the
state
agency
who
acts
as
a
dispersing
agent
only
and
yet
it
is
governed
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
and
so,
my
point
is
this,
that
in
referring
to
this
law,
the
state,
and
i
would
like
to
point
before
my
argument
is
closed,
i
noticed
just
recently
that
in
page
38
of
my
brief,
section
3305
has
the
old
laws
instead
of
the
new
laws
and
the
new
laws
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
and
my
apologies
to
the
court
for
this
error
by
the
printer
and
also
by
myself.
but
taking
these,
was
briefly
in
sequence,
3301
is
the
start
of
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
then
3306
was
amended
and
it
provides
that
the
legislature
of
the
states
my
tax
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
government
in
certain
instances.
and
then,
in
fact,
it's
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
my
brief,
page
45,
it
says,
“the
legislature
of
any
state
my
require
any
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
other
than
an
instrumentality
to
which
section
3306
(c)
(6)
applies.
and
that
is
the
only
specific
exception
set
forth
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
so
we
have
this
enabling
legislation
in
1960,
effective
of
1962
and
the
state
of
colorado
already
have
a
law
on
the
books
which
is
set
forth
on
my
brief,
enabling
the
department
of
employment
to
tax
instrumentalities.
and
so,
we
look
to
the
language
of
3306
(c)
(6)
and
in
there,
and
this
is
the
only
exception
which
congress
has
not
waived
its
immunity,
its
service
in
the
employ
of
the
united
states
government
or
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
which
is
wholly
or
partially
owned
by
the
united
states.
this
is
not
applicable
to
the
american
national
red
cross.
the
other
exception
is
(b)
where
it
says,
“exempt
from
the
tax
imposed
by
section
3301
by
virtue
of
any
provision
of
law
which
specifically
refers
to
such
section
or
the
corresponding
section
of
prior
law
in
granting
such
exemption.
it's
also
is
not
applicable
to
the
american
national
red
cross
because
there
is
no
specific
reference
to
3301.
and
for
such
reason,
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
congress'
intent
in
setting
up
this
3306
exception
was
to
say,
“you
may
tax
instrumentalities,
but
do
not
tax
our
employees.
we
already
cover
them
as
a
self-insured
so
to
speak
and
for
such
reason
it
would
be
ridiculous.
that
completes
my
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
i
addressed
my
matters
to
the
court
in
the
beginning
of
my
brief
and
i
appreciate
you
bringing
that
point
up.
i
submit
that
it's
a
two-fold
situation.
the
court
must
first
of
all
find
that
this
–
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
and
that
the
united
states
government
had
a
proprietary
or
pecuniary
interest
in
this
matter
before
it
can
go
back
to
this
question
of
jurisdiction.
if
it
finds
that
it's
not
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government,
then
it
would
follow
that
it
would
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court
as
well,
but
it
would
probably
resolve
the
matters
in
entirety
by
that
ruling
and
that's
why,
mr.
justice
fortas,
why
my
opening
argument
was
the
question
on
instrumentality.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
well,
my
position,
it
was
in
all
candor
i
think
it's
hard
though
as
an
officer
of
this
court
to
openly
advocate
to
say
that
the
livingstone
case
and
the
arlington
case
don't
resolve
it
because
in
effect,
by
dictum
they
probably
do
and
in
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
and
so
would
the
us
district
court,
but
there
is
a
fine
distinguishing
factor
there.
i
mentioned
this
as
a
part
of
this
argument.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
this
is
a
direct
from
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
united
stated
district
court
in
and
for
the
district
of
colorado.
there
are
three
questions
presented
to
this
court.
no.
1
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
in
the
subject
matter
to
this
action;
the
second
question
is
whether
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
or
agency,
and
i
use
the
words
interchangeably,
of
the
united
states
government;
and
the
third
question
is
if
the
court
finds
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government,
has
congress
waived
its
immunity
from
taxation
by
its
1960
amendments
to
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
which
became
effective,
january
1962.
this
action
arose,
and
i
go
on
way
of
background,
that
because
of
the
proviso
of
the
amendment
to
the
colorado
employment
security
act
which
is
set
forth
in
chapter
82,
1963
crs
(colorado
revised
statutes)
which
taxes
all
non-profit
organizations
in
the
state
of
colorado.
for
example,
we
tax
hospitals,
churches;
there
are
clerical
exemptions,
etcetera
but
other
organizations
such
as
the
salvation
army,
the
colorado
bar
association,
etcetera,
are
covered
under
the
colorado
employment
security
act.
colorado
is
one
of
three
states
which
taxes
non-profit
corporations
under
its
colorado
employment
security
act.
the
other
two
states
are
alaska
and
hawaii.
now
two
of
these
states,
namely:
colorado
and
alaska
elected
to
tax
the
american
national
red
cross
under
the
employment
security
acts
and
as
a
result,
this
action
was
brought
in
the
colorado
district
court,
united
stated
district
court,
seeking
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
colorado
department
of
employment
and
its
executive
director,
bernardi
tist,
from
assessing
further
taxes
against
the
american
national
red
cross.
the
department
of
employment
appeared
and
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
and
moved
to
strike
the
united
states
of
america
as
a
party-plaintiff
to
this
action
and
the
appellee
moved
for
a
summary
judgment.
these
matters
were
argued
to
a
three-judge
court
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
upon
hearing
of
oral
arguments,
the
united
state
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
granted
our
motion
to
strike
the
united
states
government
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
failed
to
state
an
adequate
claim
for
relief.
then,
the
matter
was
heard
on
its
merits
and
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
united
states
district
court
so
ruled
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
they
reinstated
the
united
states
as
a
party-plaintiff
on
this
matter
and
this
matter
is
now
on
appeal
to
this
court
on
a
direct
appeal.
now,
directing
my
argument
to
these
three
issues,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
argument
primarily
first
of
all
to
the
second
question
because
it
has
near
relation
to
question
no.
1.
we
submit
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
not
an
instrumentality
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
it
is
a
creature
of
congress
under
title
xxxvi
and
so
is
the
boy
scouts,
there
is
the
american
revolution,
the
american
historical
society,
reference
of
foreign
works,
etcetera.
but
congress
has
manifested
and
expressed
intent
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government.
in
fact,
looking
at
the
act
itself
in
title
xxxvi
and
referring
also
to
title
x,
congress
conveys
fact
that
this
is
a
private
organization
rendering
voluntary
assistance
to
the
united
states
government
when
it
is
requested
to
do
so.
now,
under
title
x,
for
example,
there
are
two
provisos
in
there
which
i
think
are
significant
in
construing
the
legal
status
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
one
is
the
fact
that
refers
to
the
power
of
the
president
to
accept
the
assistance
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
it
never
speaks
about
a
duty
for
the
american
national
red
cross
to
comply
with
federal
request.
in
fact,
all
of
these
matters
in
which
the
red
cross
assists
the
united
states
government
are
bilateral
agreements
and
of
a
voluntary
nature.
the
second
matter,
which
is
of
importance
in
title
x
is
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
provided
in
section
2602
(e)
that
red
cross
employee
should
not
be
considered
as
federal
employee
or
employees
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
there
are
--
in
other
--
in
actions
in
the
past,
some
of
which
i
do
not
submit
as
precedent,
and
i’m
sure
counsel
for
the
other
side
would
not
as
submit
as
precedent,
there
are
ceremonies
of
proclamations
by
former
presidents
of
the
united
states
which
say
that,
“it
is
a
quasi
organization
or
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states
government”.
on
the
other
hand,
the
secretary
of
labor
in
1944
passed
a
regulation
stating
that
red
cross
and
salvation
army
were
not
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
government.
internal
revenue
code
has
made
rulings
on
this
matter,
but
congress
has
spoken
once
again
in
title
xlii
under
the
national
disaster
act.
and,
of
course,
one
of
the
roles
of
the
american
national
red
cross,
it
has
four-fold
purposes:
one,
is
to
assist
the
armed
forces;
two,
is
to
give
disaster
relief;
three,
is
to
conduct
fund
appeals
and
four,
is
to
interpret
the
red
cross
to
the
local
community
and
these
are
brought
out
by
the
testimony
on
page
100
of
the
record.
but
one
of
their
--
as
their
assistance
to
the
armed
forces
or,
excuse
me,
under
the
--
so
far
as
the
national
disaster
is
concerned
under
the
title
xlii,
under
the
national
disaster
act,
it
specifically
provides
in
defining
federal
agencies
that
the
american
national
read
cross
shall
not
be
considered
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
looking
to
the
charter
so
to
speak
for
the
enabling
statute
for
the
american
red
cross,
there
are
other
manifestations
of
congress
which
show
that
the
united
states
has
not
exerted
a
power
or
a
controlling
power
over
the
american
national
red
cross.
for
one,
the
president
has
the
power
to
appoint
8
to
a
board
of
50
members.
in
of
this,
none
fit
into
the
executive
committee.
then
the
act
refers
to
voluntary
relief,
voluntary
assistance
etcetera
and
then
once
again
and
by
previous
actions
of
the
red
cross,
and
by
the
evidence
in
the
record
it
shows
that
these
are
agreements
where
they
meet,
they
enter
into
a
bilateral
agreement
and
they
carry
these
matters
up.
the
red
cross
would
point
out
that
they
are
the
sole
agent
who
disperses
problems
or
supplies
in
times
of
disaster
and
yet
the
salvation
army
has
brought
up,
by
the
evidence
also,
renders
valuable
assistance
even
though
they
may
not
be
the
recognized
dispersing
authority.
the
salvation
army
plays
just
as
important
role
so
far
as
the
national
disasters
are
concerned
and
yet,
the
salvation
army
is
taxed
under
the
colorado
employment
security
act.
it
does
not
rule
itself
out
as
an
instrumentality
or
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
only
the
power
to
accept
the
assistance
of
the
red
cross
in
other
words,
and
i
submit
that
that
red
cross
works
only
in
a
private
sector
and
not
a
public
sector.
this
was
brought
out
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
dermet
(ph),
who
was
former
director
of
the
office
of
the
emergency
planning
and
his
testimony
is
set
forth
in
folios
or
pages
79
and
86
of
the
record.
so
in
essence,
the
red
cross
gives
voluntary
relief
to
private
needs
and
from
private
funds.
now,
another
interesting
facet
--
is
the
fact
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
one
of
various
national
organizations
which
belongs
to
the
international
red
cross
conference.
and
as
brought
out
also
in
the
testimony
on
the
record,
the
international
red
cross
conference,
which
is
worldwide,
requires
in
its
charter
that
its
member
organizations
remain
autonomous,
by
that
i
mean
that
they
remain
autonomous
from
the
government
with
which
it
works.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
role
of
the
american
national
red
cross
is
a
noble
one
and
a
humanitarian
one.
and
the
interesting
part
of
the
testimony
is
the
fact
that
it's
not
national
humanitarian;
it's
international
humanitarianism.
in
other
words,
as
brought
out
by
the
testimony,
they
assist
armed
forces
of
enemy
countries
as
well
as
those
of
our
country.
so
they
have
this
international
humanitarian
scheme.
of
course,
the
salvation
army
renders
the
same
service.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
mr.
justice
fortas,
my
answer
to
that
is
title
x
or,
excuse
me,
title
xxii
and
that
is
this:
that
congress
has
set
forth
a
great
number
or
many
more
controls
over
the
instrument
of
national
banks.
they
have
the
power
to
pass
on
their
mergers,
appoint
receivers,
to
pass
on
the
or
approve
on
the
stock
that
they
issue
and
that
brief
–
they
would
take
--
there
are
number
ones
which
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
but
they
explicitly
have
(voice
overlap)
much
more
authority.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
in
title
xxii.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
for
example
the
inside
operation
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
yes
it's
true
that
they
do
have
their
national
headquarters
here
on
the
united
states
government
land
and
interestingly
enough,
the
next
building
to
the
south
is
the
daughters
of
the
american
revolution.
but
at
the
same
time,
let's
go
to
the
trade
michigan
where
they
have
a
commercial
building
which
they
operate
for
a
profit
which
the
money
goes
back
into
the
operation
of
the
national
red
cross.
let's
take
for
example
the
fact
that
through
out
the
country,
they
retain
private
legal
counsel.
they
have
a
private
public
accounting
firm.
they
have
two
audits
every
year
and
one
is
conducted
at
their
expense
by
asking
themselves
certified
public
accountants
and
the
other
is
conducted
by
the
department
of
defense
and
they
are
required
to
reimburse
the
department
of
defense
for
the
audit.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
checks
that
the
united
states
government
makes
upon,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
interesting
point
is
that
the
united
states
government
does
not
give
them
any
money.
in
fact,
the
red
cross
over
the
years
has
prided
themselves
on
the
fact
that
they
receive
no
money
from
the
united
states
government.
the
red
cross
does
not
have
a
title
so
to
speak
in
the
american
national
red
cross
and
in
fact,
looking
at
their
motor
vehicles,
they
are
titled
in
the
name
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
through
out
the
states,
they
have
--
they
title
their
vehicles
in
their
respective
state
registration
requirements.
there
are
nurses
who
are
subject
to
local
and
state
registrations
and
they
subject
themselves
to
withholding
tax,
for
example,
in
the
state
of
colorado
and
another
states.
these
matters
are
also
set
forth
in
the
record.
now,
counsel
points
out
this
case
of
standard
oil
versus
johnson,
which
this
case
is
previously
entered
as
decision
in
316
us
and
which
is
set
forth
in
both
briefs
and,
i
think
that
that
case
is
not
controlling
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
in
fact,
i
think,
it
is
easily
distinguished.
in
that
case,
we
talked
about
an
army
post
exchange,
a
situation
or
a
post
exchange
that
was
run
by
a
member
of
the
military
service
where
the
money
is
originally
appropriated
from
the
treasury
to
run
the
post
exchange
where
salaries
are
paid
by
the
united
states
government
for
employees
to
run
this
and
in
the
event
that
it
closes
up,
the
reversion
of
profits
or
balance
goes
back
to
the
treasury.
i
submit
another
or
in
fact
a
better
test
insofar
is
the
question
on
these
matter
is
concerned
is
the
case
of
unemployment
compensation
commission
of
north
carolina
versus
wachovia
bank
and
trust,
this
is
north
carolina
case
which
is
set
forth
on
my
brief.
and
in
there,
the
court,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
stated
five
elements
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
government
instrumentality
or
agency.
one
was,
did
the
government
create
it?
well,
that's
applicable
here.
no.
2,
is
that
wholly
owned
by
the
government?
this
is
not
true
here
because
it
is
not
even
partially
owned
by
the
government.
three,
was
it
operated
for
profit?
well,
this
would
be
applicable
here,
the
red
cross
is
a
non-profit
organization.
is
it
engaged
primarily
in
the
governmental
function
is
the
forth
test
and
we
submit,
the
evidence
was
substantiated,
that
this
is
not
their
primary
function.
this
is
one
of
their
functions,
but
this
is
not
their
major
function.
and
the
fifth
and
most
important
test
is
whether
the
proposed
tax
such
as
the
colorado
employment
security
act
tax,
which
would
come
out
of
that
act,
would
that
impose
an
economic
burden
on
the
government
of
the
united
states?
and
i
submit
that
this
would
not
be
the
case.
the
united
states
government
would
not
be
subject
to
this
tax
or
would
it
create
a
burden
on
the
united
states
government
in
this
regard.
and
this
comes
to
–
one
of
the
key
issues,
i
think
the
point
is,
that
the
reason
the
instrumentality
exemption
is
set
forth
is
to
prevent
a
burden,
undue
burden
on
the
united
states
government.
there
would
be
no
tax
imposed.
the
united
states
government
would
not
be
obligated
in
anyway
for
the
payment
of
this
tax
and
for
such
reason
i
think
that
that's
the
key
test
along
with
the
other
onus
in
the
wachovia
case
to
show
that
red
cross
does
not
qualify
as
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
i've
already
pointed
out
the
four
functions
of
the
american
national
red
cross.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
case,
that's
miller
versus
city
of
greenbelt
and
in
that
–
it
cites
also
grace
versus
new
york,
306
us
466.
in
the
language
of
the
court
there,
i'm
referring
to
grace
versus
new
york,
says
that,
“when
the
national
government
lawfully
acts
through
a
corporation
which
it
owns
and
controls,
those
activities
are
governmental
functions
entitled
to
tax
immunity”.
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
concluding
on
this
particular
point,
i
think
that
the
status
of
the
red
cross
is
best
defined
by
mr.
basal
o'conner,
who
was
national
chairman
of
the
american
national
red
cross
in
1946
and
this
is
set
forth
in
his
quotation
in
the
appellee's-plaintiff
exhibit
“8”
--
“18”
which
is
the
1946
american
annual
or
american
red
cross
annual
report.
mr.
o'conner
stated
“the
international
red
cross
committee
has
always
maintained
that
the
national
societies,
while
cooperating
closely
with
their
own
government
and
with
other
agencies
but
at
the
same
time
remain
independent.
this
explains
to
a
certain
extent
the
unique
position
of
the
american
red
cross
in
the
light
of
the
country.
cooperating
closely
with
the
government
it
is
in
no
sense
a
part
of
the
government.
working
hand
in
hand
with
many
agencies,
it
still
retains
its
freedom
of
action.
and
now,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
address
my
next
remark
issue
no.
1
and
that
is
the
jurisdiction
so
far
as
the
united
states
district
court
is
concerned.
first
of
all
–
sir?
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
going
to
answer
that
question,
my
third
argument
but
i'll
answer
briefly
now.
i
have
submitted
on
page
41
of
my
brief
three
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
feel
would
defeat
any
significance
to
be
given
by
that
testimony
or
statements
by
members
and
committee
because
of
the
fact,
if
that
was
such
a
vital
concern,
congress
had
the
power
to
expressly
exempt
the
american
national
red
cross
from
coverage
under
the
1960
amendment.
and
the
1960
amendment
makes
specific
language
which
specifically
exempts
only
certain
organizations
or
a
certain
type
of
organization.
and,
i
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
aldridge
case,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case,
in
the
united
states
versus
trade
association
that
this
could
not
be
given
construction
in
determining
the
intent
of
congress.
does
it
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
alright,
sir.
so
far
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
us
district
court
in
denver's
concern,
your
honors,
we
based
our
objection
and
feel
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
should
have
applied
in
this
regard
in
that
the
us
district
court
should
have
refused
to
accept
jurisdiction
of
the
matter
because
of
title
xxviii,
section
1351
which
as
your
honor
is
well
aware
provides
that
the
courts
shall
not
enjoin
the
assessment
of
state
taxes
when
the
relief
may
be
had
in
state
courts.
now,
we
submit
that
the
united
states
or
should
i
say
(inaudible)
that
the
american
national
red
cross
had
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
denver
district
court
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
82
article
ix
and
section
9
of
the
1963
and
then
the
1953
colorado
revised
statutes.
they
simply
had
to
ask
for
a
refund,
have
an
objection
applied
or
refusal
thereto
and
immediately
file
suit
in
the
denver
district
court
for
an
interpretation
or
for
a
judicial
ruling
on
their
entitlement
or
non-entitlement
to
a
refund
under
the
colorado
employment
security
act.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
were.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
i
think
that
it
touches
upon
a
gray
area
because
they
touch
–
they
mentioned
first
of
all
the
arlington
case
and
the
livingstone
case.
now,
those
cases
don't
just
give
unqualified
authority
on
applicability
or
non-applicability
of
1341
whether
is
the
united
states
named
as
a
party
because
in
the
arlington
case,
they
refer
to
it
not
being
applicable
where
the
united
states
has
the
proprietary
function.
and
this
was
a
case
where
bottomly,
a
naval
officer
his
taxes
were
involved.
the
livingstone
case
referred
to
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
has
a
pecuniary
interest.
and
i
submit,
perhaps
that
this
is
a
fine
point,
but
i
submit
that
in
neither
of
these
cases,
that
the
united
states
have
a
proprietary
interest
or
a
pecuniary
interest.
in
fact,
they
did
not
even
allege
in
their
complaint
nor
did
they
prove
it.
the
unique
part
is
that
they
were
dismissed
throughout
the
trial
and
then
they
reinstated
at
the
end
of
the
trial
from
the
motion
to
strike.
and
for
such
reason,
i
submit
that
the
arlington
and
the
livingstone
case,
although
being
warm
on
the
subject,
are
not
absolute
authority
for
this
premise.
i
would
also
point
out
the
fact
that
proprietary
insofar
as
webster
is
concerned,
is
one
who
has
exclusive
title
or
ownership
in
something
and
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
with
the
united
states
government.
now,
there
a
question
also
arises
that
would
they
have
an
adequate
and
speedy
remedy
at
law?
there's
no
doubt
the
united
states
has
presented
cases
here
which
have
merit
upon
this
point,
but
there
are
also
cases
to
the
contrary.
and,
i
submit
that
--
of
course,
i
will
submit
that
these
cases;
one
of
them
is
the
toomer
versus
witsell
case,
the
previous
decision
of
this
court
and
i
submit
that
matthews
versus
rogers,
although
it's
not
the
case
in
point,
has
language
which
has
significance
as
to
the
reasoning
behind
it.
and,
i
cite
the
washington
case
of
state
versus
police
court
of
seattle
and
they
say
there
is
not
a
general
rule;
it
depends
upon
the
facts.
the
interesting
point
of
this
case
is
the
us
district
court
made
no
ruling
on
the
question
of
interest
so
that
they
say
they
were
not
entitled
to
interest
on
the
refund.
that's
as
far
as
they
went.
and,
i
question
the
logic
of
--
and
perhaps
this
is
through
my
ignorance,
your
honors,
but
why
this
would
have
so
much
bearing
so
far
as
the
awarding
of
interest
is
concerned
on
a
plain
and
adequate
and
speedy
remedy
at
law.
because
the
main
thing
is,
as
the
washington
case
points
out
and
also
the
matthews
versus
rogers
decision
of
this
court,
it
goes
into
a
much
greater
significance
so
far
as
the
reasonable
remedies
which
they
have.
for
example,
one
of
the
cases
that
talks
about
-
i
think
it's
the
matthews
case,
that
talks
about
where
there
were
four
hearings
involved
instead
of
two
and
they
said
that
regardless
to
that
fact
that
there
would
still
be
--
this
would
not
deprive
them
of
a
speedy
and
adequate
remedy.
now
the
toomer
case
for
example
is
where
the
georgia
fishermen
sought
to
enjoin
the
south
carolina
tax
commission
for
taxing
for
fishing
in
south
carolina
territory
and
in
that
case,
there
was
no
discussion
about
refund
one
way
or
the
other,
but
there's
no
language
by
the
court
to
show
that
a
refund
of
interest
would
have
been
paid
and
yet,
this
court
held
that
there
was
jurisdiction
there
in
the
state
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
answer
lastly
the
third
question
and
that
is,
if
this
court
is
to
rule
that
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government,
has
congress
waived
its
immunity?
and
in
doing
so,
i'd
like
to
go
into
background
once
again
and
that
is
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
which
is
set
forth
in
title
xxvi,
section
3301
in
sequence,
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
i
think
has
to
be
understood
from
its
basic
roots
to
understand
what
congress
did
in
1960
and
that
has
thrown
exception
in
the
1930s.
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
was
set
up
as
a
sort
of
a
guideline
to
the
states
saying
that
you
will
pass
laws
if
you
wish
to
tax
in
your
states,
certain
employers
but
we
will
provide
minimum
standards.
they
used
to
be,
for
example,
eight
or
more
employees
for
a
period
of
20
weeks.
now,
one
of
the
minimum
standards
is
four
more
employees
for
20
calendar
weeks
in
one
year.
and
so
they
set
forth
these
minimum
standards
and
the
states
go
along
and
they
have
different
discretions
on
certain
matters.
for
example,
alaska,
colorado
and
hawaii
tax
non-profits;
the
rest
of
them
do
not.
congress
has
not
stated
that
you
have
to
tax
non-profits,
but
they
say
--
they
don't
also
say
that
you
cannot,
excuse
me
--
they
don't
say
that
you
can't
tax
non-profit
organizations.
so
this
is
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
states,
but
the
reason
3306
(c)
(6)
of
title
xxvi
comes
into
play
here
is
the
fact
that
congress
has
made
it
very
clear
that
they
don't
want
the
states
to
tax
federal
employees
because
they
are
already
covered
by
the
united
states
government.
in
other
words,
civil
service
employees
of
the
united
states
government
are
covered
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
and
when
a
person
is
laid
off
or
has
a
claim
for
unemployment
benefits,
he
files
a
claim
and
the
claim
is
filed
through
the
state
agency
who
acts
as
a
dispersing
agent
only
and
yet
it
is
governed
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
and
so,
my
point
is
this,
that
in
referring
to
this
law,
the
state,
and
i
would
like
to
point
before
my
argument
is
closed,
i
noticed
just
recently
that
in
page
38
of
my
brief,
section
3305
has
the
old
laws
instead
of
the
new
laws
and
the
new
laws
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
and
my
apologies
to
the
court
for
this
error
by
the
printer
and
also
by
myself.
but
taking
these,
was
briefly
in
sequence,
3301
is
the
start
of
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
then
3306
was
amended
and
it
provides
that
the
legislature
of
the
states
my
tax
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
government
in
certain
instances.
and
then,
in
fact,
it's
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
my
brief,
page
45,
it
says,
“the
legislature
of
any
state
my
require
any
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
other
than
an
instrumentality
to
which
section
3306
(c)
(6)
applies.
and
that
is
the
only
specific
exception
set
forth
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
so
we
have
this
enabling
legislation
in
1960,
effective
of
1962
and
the
state
of
colorado
already
have
a
law
on
the
books
which
is
set
forth
on
my
brief,
enabling
the
department
of
employment
to
tax
instrumentalities.
and
so,
we
look
to
the
language
of
3306
(c)
(6)
and
in
there,
and
this
is
the
only
exception
which
congress
has
not
waived
its
immunity,
its
service
in
the
employ
of
the
united
states
government
or
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
which
is
wholly
or
partially
owned
by
the
united
states.
this
is
not
applicable
to
the
american
national
red
cross.
the
other
exception
is
(b)
where
it
says,
“exempt
from
the
tax
imposed
by
section
3301
by
virtue
of
any
provision
of
law
which
specifically
refers
to
such
section
or
the
corresponding
section
of
prior
law
in
granting
such
exemption.
it's
also
is
not
applicable
to
the
american
national
red
cross
because
there
is
no
specific
reference
to
3301.
and
for
such
reason,
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
congress'
intent
in
setting
up
this
3306
exception
was
to
say,
“you
may
tax
instrumentalities,
but
do
not
tax
our
employees.
we
already
cover
them
as
a
self-insured
so
to
speak
and
for
such
reason
it
would
be
ridiculous.
that
completes
my
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
i
addressed
my
matters
to
the
court
in
the
beginning
of
my
brief
and
i
appreciate
you
bringing
that
point
up.
i
submit
that
it's
a
two-fold
situation.
the
court
must
first
of
all
find
that
this
–
the
american
national
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
and
that
the
united
states
government
had
a
proprietary
or
pecuniary
interest
in
this
matter
before
it
can
go
back
to
this
question
of
jurisdiction.
if
it
finds
that
it's
not
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government,
then
it
would
follow
that
it
would
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court
as
well,
but
it
would
probably
resolve
the
matters
in
entirety
by
that
ruling
and
that's
why,
mr.
justice
fortas,
why
my
opening
argument
was
the
question
on
instrumentality.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
james
d.
mckevitt
well,
my
position,
it
was
in
all
candor
i
think
it's
hard
though
as
an
officer
of
this
court
to
openly
advocate
to
say
that
the
livingstone
case
and
the
arlington
case
don't
resolve
it
because
in
effect,
by
dictum
they
probably
do
and
in
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
and
so
would
the
us
district
court,
but
there
is
a
fine
distinguishing
factor
there.
i
mentioned
this
as
a
part
of
this
argument.
