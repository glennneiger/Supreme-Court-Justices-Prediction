c.
clark
may
i
ask?
i
thought
basically
that
the
government
provision
was
that
this
is
an
instrumentality
immune
from
state
taxation
and
that
the
immunity
has
not
been
waived
by
the
congress
(voice
overlap)
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
everything
that
it
does
in
colorado
may
be
outside
the
--
may
be
the

of
thing
which
doesn't
have
a
particular
governmental
phrase.
if
you're
right,
doesn't
the
immunity
apply
that
hasn't
been
waived?
