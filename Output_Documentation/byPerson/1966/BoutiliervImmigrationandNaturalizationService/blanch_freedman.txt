ms.
blanch
freedman
if
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
is
an
alien
of
canadian
nationality.
he
is
33
years
old,
was
duly
admitted
to
the
united
states
for
permanent
residence
in
june
1955
when
he
was
21.
he
has
lived
in
the
united
states
ever
since,
working
--
and
working
here,
always
self-supporting.
by
occupation,
he
is
a
building
maintenance
operator.
he
resides
in
new
york
city
with
his
mother,
who
was
a
naturalized
citizen
and
stepfather,
also
a
citizen.
his
father
is
dead.
and
in
addition,
he
has
a
large
family
of
married
brothers
and
sisters
who
lived
in
this
country
with
their
respective
spouses
and
children.
petitioner
appeals
from
an
order
of
deportation
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
below
that
is
the
second
circuit.
the
order
is
predicated
upon
the
combined
operation
of
two
provisions
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
law.
section
241
(a)
(1)
of
the
1952
act,
which
renders
an
alien
deportable
if
at
the
time
of
admission
he
was
excludable.
and
to
section
212
(a)
(4)
of
the
act
which
makes
excludable
an
alien
who
at
the
time
of
entry
is
“afflicted
with
a
psychopathic
personality,
epilepsy
or
mental
defect.”
now,
the
responding
charges
that
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
entry
in
1955
was
afflicted
with
a
psychopathic
personality
namely
sexual
deviant
to
which
homosexual.
the
finding
of
psychopathic
personality
rests
solely
and
exclusively
upon
admissions
by
petitioner
of
having
engaged
in
homosexual
acts
before
but
principally,
after
entry.
the
evidence
of
record
is,
that
prior
entry
in
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21,
he
had
have
about
three
to
four
experiences
a
year
during
which
time
he
also
engaged
in
heterosexual
experiences.
after
entry
and
up
to
the
time
he
was
directed
to
appear
before
the
immigration
service
some
nine
years
later,
his
homosexual
activities
averaged
about
four
or
three
times
a
year.
these
admissions
were
made
by
the
petitioner
at
the
immigration
service
upon
interrogation
by
an
immigrant
inspector
in
january
1964
and
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
question
and
answer
statement.
on
this
statement
of
admissions
of
homosexual
activity
before
but
largely
after
entry,
and
of
no
medical
evidence
of
any
kind,
the
united
states
public
health
service
forthwith
certified
that
at
the
time
of
entry,
almost
ten
years
prior,
petitioner
was
excludable
as
an
alien
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
namely,
homosexual.
at
the
deportation
hearing,
petitioner
submitted
into
evidence
two
medical
reports
of
two
imminent
psychiatrists,
who
had
examined
him
personally
each
a
year
apart
and
independently
of
the
other.
the
medical
evidence
of
the
record
establishes
that
the
petitioner
is
not
psychotic;
that
the
petitioner
is
not
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality.
there
is
no
counter-medical
evidence
in
the
case.
on
the
contrary,
respondent
admits
that
it
has
not
proved
to
furnish
evidence
that
petitioner
is
psychopathic.
instead,
respondent
claims
that
such
medical
evidence
is
not
required
of
it
because
it
construes
and
applies
the
language
of
the
statute
that
is
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
to
mean,
an
alien
who
indulges
in
homosexual
conduct,
even
though
such
conduct
is
medically
unassociated
with
psychopathic
personality
or
any
other
medical
condition.
the
respondent
claims
that
its
construction
of
the
law
is
based
upon
it
speedily
that
that
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
enacted
the
1952
immigration
act.
in
short,
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
term
psychopathic
personality
may
mean
to
the
whole
world,
to
the
congress
that
enacted
it,
it
was
merely
a
rubric,
a
rubric
by
which
homosexuals
were
to
be
excluded
from
the
country.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
it
is
this
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statute
to
him
that
engenders
constitutional
infirmity.
as
construed
and
applied,
the
statute
is
vague,
indefinite
and
denied
petitioner
due
process
of
law.
because
one,
it
contains
no
boundaries,
no
standards,
no
guide
for
its
enforcement.
and
two,
because
it
failed
to
give
petitioner
adequate
notice
that
his
homosexual
behavior
after
entry
could
be
used
to
establish
the
alleged
excludable
condition,
psychopathic
personality
at
entry.
the
constitutional
deficiencies
that
stemmed
from
respondent's
interpretation
and
administration
of
the
statute
led
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
fleuti
against
rosenberg
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional.
and
thereafter
that
--
that
court
affirmed
its
decision
in
the
very
recent
case
of
lavoie
against
the
immigration
service
that
is
now
pending
before
this
court
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
the
facts
and
issues
in
the
fleuti,
lavoie
and
the
instant
case
are
the
same.
the
major
problem
that
underlies
the
respondent's
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
the
actual
language
of
section
212
(a)
(4)
is
medical
terminology
and
in
design
and
purpose
relates
to
the
exclusions
of
aliens
afflicted
with
a
condition
that
medically
can
be
diagnosed
a
psychopathic
personality
whereas
homosexuality
or
homosexual
--
or
homosexual
relates
to
conduct,
to
behavior.
there
is
no
homosexual
condition
per
se,
thereof
homosexual
acts.
of
course,
a
person
who
engages
in
homosexual
practices
may
be
a
psychopathic
personality
but
psychopathology
cannot
be
inferred
automatically
from
homosexual
practices.
ms.
blanch
freedman
alone.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
sir.
ms.
blanch
freedman
oh,
no,
sir.
i
come
to
that.
i
believe
the
--
we
do
believe
and
we
so
state
in
our
second
point.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
on
the
contrary,
sir.
we
say
psychopathic
personality
as
it
appears
in
that
statute
has
a
describable
and
ascertainable
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
if
i'm
doing
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
then
we
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
however,
sir,
as
i
will
come
to
it,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
respondent
has
interpreted
the
constitutional
history
correctly.
i
mean,
that
that
is
the
legislative
history.
now,
that
--
you
cannot
deduce
from
homosexual
activity
alone.
a
psychopathic
condition
or
psychopathic
personality
is
not
only
the
opinion
of
the
enumerable
side
--
authority
cited
in
counsel's
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
homosexual
lower
form
society,
which
is
before
this
court.
it
is
also
the
opinion
of
doctor
paul
g.
smith,
the
senior
service
surgeon
of
the
united
states
public
health
service
and
chief
in
psychiatry
at
the
public
health
service
hospital
at
new
york.
now,
dr.
smith
testified
in
the
matter
of
(inaudible).
he
had
also
testified
so
--
that
is
certified
the
alien
in
that
case
to
be
a
psychopathic
personality
under
facts
that
are
similar
to
his
certification
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
yet
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
he
testified
that
he
was
in
accord
with
medical
opinion
that
sex
deviate
is
not
ipso
facto,
a
psychopathic
personality.
he
agreed
that
to
arrive
at
such
a
medical
finding,
there
must
be
something
more
than
sexual
deviation.
the
doctor
was
then
asked
how
we
reconciled
his
certification
of
the
alien
of
the
psychopathic
personality
with
his
professional
opinion
and
to
this
he
replied
and
i
quote,
“that
as
a
qualified
physician,
he
was
fully
in
accord
with
modern
psychiatric
theory
but
that
as
an
employee
of
the
united
states
public
health
service,
he
was
bound
by
any
instruction
of
the
organization
addressed
to
his
employees.
thus,
it
is
evident
from
knowledgeable
sources
than
in
the
given
situation
whether
the
homosexual
conduct
denotes
an
excludable
pathologic
condition
is
a
matter
to
be
established
only
by
competent
examination
of
the
alien
by
qualified
physicians
and
not
merely
upon
admissions
of
homosexual
practices
that
have
been
extracted
by
an
immigrant
inspec
--
inspector
upon
interrogation
with
the
view
to
possible
deportation.”
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
actually
substitutes
homosexual
behavior
for
the
psychopathic
condition
stated
in
the
law
and
it
is
this
very
substitution
that
creates
the
vagueness
in
which
the
law
is
left
without
enforcement
of
the
admi
--
of
the
administrato
--
of
administrative
interpretation
without
guidelines,
without
boundaries,
without
tests
of
any
kind.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
was
done
in
october
of
1965.
that
was
several
years
after
--
many
years
after
the
situation
that
relates
to
this
case.
ms.
blanch
freedman
well,
clearly,
they're
expressing
then
i
would
say
doubts
that
prevailed
in
the
section
--
that
prevailed
in
the
statute,
if
that
is
what
they
are
clarifying.
but
of
course,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
accept
a
clarification
of
this
congress
to
what
the
1952
congress
really
had
in
mind.
ms.
blanch
freedman
they
never
said
that.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
it
is
enumerated
as
a
separate
category.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
they
say
that
is
in
response
to
--
that
is
the
reaction
of
the
1965
congress
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
to
the
fleuti
decision.
ms.
blanch
freedman
counsel
for
the
government
is
not
wholly
unmindful
that
there
are
no
boundaries
and
there
are
no
real
test/criteria
and
so
they
say
in
their
brief
on
page
36,
“there
may
indeed
be
cases
where
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
and
in
precisely
what
sense
an
individual
should
be
deemed
homosexual
within
the
intent
of
the
statute”.
now,
we
submit,
one
may
rightfully
ask
by
what
standard
or
test
the
government
determined
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
should
be
deemed
a
homosexual
within
the
intent
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
respondent.
now,
there
is
no
answer
disclosed
and
their
brief
is
significantly
silent.
now,
assuming
as
respondent
contends
and
congress
intended
to
bar
homosexuals
from
to
for
from
immigration,
we
are
still
left
without
an
adequate
standard
or
criteria
to
determine
whom
the
label
“homosexual”
covers
because
the
term
“homosexual”
does
not
described
an
ascertainable
condition.
at
best
it
denotes
a
category
and
that
category
is
also
undefined
and
lacking
insufficient
specificity
to
withstand
the
constitutional
challenge
of
vagueness.
but
this
difficulty,
this
lack
of
standard
does
not
exist
when
the
statute
is
enforced
as
agrees
and
as
we
believe
congress
mandated.
within
the
homosexual
behavior
that
is
reached
for
exclusion
under
the
law,
is
that
which
is
medically
ascertainable
and
found
to
be
pathologic,
namely,
that
denotes
a
psychopathic
personality.
the
second
aspect
of
the
statute's
vagueness
that
results
from
respondent's
construction
and
application
is
that
it
fails
to
apprise
petitioner
of
what
respondent
now
claims
made
him
excludable
in
1955
and
further
failed
to
advice
him
that
post-entry
homosexual
behavior
could
be
made
the
basis
for
his
expulsion
from
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
indicate
to
petitioner
at
entry
that
psychopathic
personality
meant
homosexual
or
sex
deviant.
the
words
homosexual
or
sex
deviant
or
sexual
perversion,
do
not
appear
either
in
the
exclusion
statute
or
in
the
deportation
statute.
furthermore,
there
was
nothing
in
the
visa
application
that
petitioner
was
obliged
to
execute
in
montreal,
canada
that
in
anyway
gave
him
any
warning.
the
visa
application
lists
all
the
excludable
classes
but
it
makes
no
mention
homosexual,
sex
deviants.
in
fact,
it
does
not
even
list
the
term
psychopathic
personality.
the
law
may
attribute
to
petitioner
knowledge
that
the
statute
excluded
from
admission
psych
--
first
aliens
with
psychopathic
personality.
but
how
can
he
be
charged
with
knowing
what
is
not
a
fact.
that
indulgence
in
homosexual
practices
means
that
one
is
so
afflicted.
to
urge
now
as
respondent
does
that
notice
and
warning
can
be
found
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
the
particular
committee
report,
i
submit,
strict
as
a
legal
presumption
of
knowledge
beyond
legality.
we
submit,
where
forfeiture
of
residence
is
predicated
upon
conduct
held
to
be
proscribed
or
utilized
as
the
basis
of
depriving
an
alien
of
the
right
to
remain
here.
due
process
requires
that
that
statute
be
clear
on
its
face.
this
is
supported
by
the
united
states
against
harris,
as
supported
by
jordan
against
de
george.
it's
supported
by
this
court
by
the
application
and
rationale
of
the
recent
case
by
this
court
in
giacco
against
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
in
theory,
petitioner's
post-entry
conduct
is
not
the
ground
for
his
deportation.
however,
it
was
the
persuasive
evidence
to
establish
that
--
to
establish
the
alleged
excludable
condition
and
entry
and
that
the
bottoms
the
finding
of
deportability
against
petitioner.
the
government's
odd
disclaimer
of
the
use
and
reliance
upon
post-entry
conduct
in
this
case
i
submit,
it's
truly
errant
and
non-sense.
permit
me
to
cite
that
one
example
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
his
entry
was
in
'55.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
his
entry
in
'55.
ms.
blanch
freedman
to
that,
may
i
submit
the
following
thoughts
for
this
court.
the
medical
evidence
and
it
is
supported
in
the
brief
by
our
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
there's
no
contest
that
he
admitted
certain
acts.
there
was
no
contest
--
contest
that
he
described
himself
when
he
was
asked,
“do
you
consider
yourself
a
homosexual?
”
ms.
blanch
freedman
no.
there
was
no
issue.
ms.
blanch
freedman
there
really
was
no
issue
tendered
because
whether
or
not
someone
is
a
homosexual
is
something
that
can
only
be
--
even
that
issue
can
only
be
described
medically
and
that
has
never
been
done
in
this
case.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
absolutely
correct,
sir.
the
government
--
i
want
to
quote
from
the
respondent's
brief
page
50,
the
last
paragraph
because
the
government
says,
they
did
not
use,
they've
made
no
reliance
upon
post-entry
conduct
and
this
is
just
one
example
of
how
--
of
how
it
operates,
“the
evidence
was
in
fact
overwhelming
and
undisputed.
the
government
established
that
the
hearing
through
petitioner's
own
admission
under
oath
that
beginning
about
1949,
six
years
prior
to
his
entry
actually
it
was
only
five
years
prior,
and
continuing
on
uninterruptedly
to
the
date
of
the
sworn
statement,
january
1964,
petitioner
had
regularly
engaged
on
an
average
of
three
or
four
times
a
year
of
homosexual
behavior.”
this
pattern
of
activity
extended
over
an
instable
of
14
and
one-half
years,
expands
the
date
of
entry.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
a
factual
statement.
but
clearly,
it
was
not
petitioner's
admission
of
three
to
four
homosexual
experiences
a
year
over
the
five
year
period
prior
his
entry.
that
really
motivated
the
deportation
proceedings
against
him
rather
it
was
his
post-entry
conduct
over
the
ensuing
nine-and-a-half
years.
now,
the
constitutional
significance
of
this,
of
this
use
to
post-entry
homosexual
act
is
that
in
this
case,
they
may
well
have
been
avoided.
had
petitioner
been
informed
by
the
statute
that
they
could
be
used
to
establish
a
pre-entry
condition
of
psychopathic
personality
for
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
petitioner's
experiences
were
compulsive
and
not
of
choice.
petitioner
could
have
and
in
all
probability
would
have
refrained
from
such
practices
from
the
time
of
entry
as
he
has
since
these
proceedings
first
gave
him
notice
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
this
statute.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that's
right.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
and
certainly
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
they
have
it
--
i'm
not
too
sure
on
the
criminal
law
whether
--
or
whether
just
to
what
extent
it
is.
i
know
we
do
have
a
law
of
sodomy
in
new
york
but
the
fact
that
he
has
never
been
convicted.
dr.
montague
ullman,
who
was
the
director
of
psychiatric
services
in
minority
hospital
in
brooklyn
and
professor
of
psychiatry
at
the
state
university
of
new
york,
examined
the
petitioner
in
march
of
1964.
and
in
his
report,
he
states
and
i'm
now
quoting
to
what
appears
in
the
record
on
page
15
and
16,
“the
patient
has
sexual
interest
in
girls
and
has
had
intercourse
with
them
on
a
number
of
occasions.”
then
skipping
in
taking
the
next
sentence,
“he
has
abandoned
all
sexual
practices
within
the
past
several
months
because
of
his
annoyance
and
disgusts
with
the
problems
these
activities
have
brought
about.
his
sexual
structure
still
appears
fluid
and
immature
so
that
he
moves
from
homosexual
to
heterosexual
interest
as
well
as
abstinence
with
almost
equal
facility.”
as
i
said
before,
the
span
of
14
years
of
homosexual
activity
that
the
respondent
talks
about,
nine-and-a-half
years
had
been
post-entry.
and
as
the
court
in
the
fleuti
case
recent
whether
a
finding
of
deportability
would
have
been
entered
against
petitioner
in
1965
based
on
the
pre-entry
conduct
prior
to
1955
or
even
whether
on
such
facts
the
charge
could
have
--
would
have
been
brought
is
a
matter
of
high
speculation.
the
facts,
however,
that
post-entry
behavior
is
relied
upon
is
some
indication
that
the
charge
might
not
have
been
filed
or
a
finding
entered
on
free
entry
behavior
alone.
respondent
proffers
to
answers
to
petitioner's
charge
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
adequate
notice.
first,
respondent
says,
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
fair
warning
because
that
doctrine
is
aimed
at
regulating
conduct,
and
now
i
quote
from
their
brief
on
page
42,
“that
the
fair
warning
doctrine
is
not
a
device
to
enable
an
individual
afflicted
with
a
condition
that
if
discovered
would
have
barred
his
admission
to
this
country
and
to
so
conducthimself
as
to
avoid
this
condition
becoming
known
to
administrative
authorities”.
and
that,
we
submit,
completely
reveals
the
failure
or
the
emptiness
of
the
government's
argument.
surely,
the
respondent
in
this
case
cannot
have
it
both
ways
because
it
is
precisely
that
there
was
a
lack
of
proof
of
condition
--
of
conditions,
psychopathic
personality.
either
before
or
after
entry
that
this
petitioner
has
been
urging
throughout
and
it
is
the
respondent
who
has
been
insisting
that
it
is
not
concerned
about
petitioner's
condition,
it
knows
how
he
is
behaved
and
that
that
is
sufficient.
the
point
is
that,
where
petitioner's
condition
is
involved
here
it
could
not
be
hidden.
but
if
behavior
is
involved,
then
it
could
have
been
controlled
by
him
that
in
fact
he
does
not
suffer
from
any
condition.
had
respondent
applied
the
statute
to
petitioner
as
it
reads
and
as
we
contend
it
should
be,
namely,
whether
petitioner
was
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
that
would
be
addressed
to
condition?
but
as
to
condition,
respondent
has
offered
no
proof
and
so
admits.
but
the
fact
is
that,
respondent
has
administered
the
statute
as
applying
to
petitioner's
condition
to
beha
--
the
petitioner's
behavior.
and
thus,
the
failure
of
the
statute
as
construed
and
applied
denied
him
the
opportunity
of
knowingly
refraining
from
engaging
in
certain
conduct.
this
is
not
to
hide
a
condition.
petitioner
has
concealed
nothing
because
he
has
no
condition.
this
is
really
to
regulate
behavior
if
the
impact
of
the
statute
demanded
it.
respondent's
other
answer
to
the
issue
of
fair
warning
is
that
since
congress
could
retroactively
make
homosexual
conduct
a
ground
for
deportation,
it
could
also
make
future
homosexual
conduct
in
this
country
by
an
alien,
a
cause
for
his
deportation
whether
or
not
its
intentions
were
expressed
clearly
though
congress
may
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
hasn't.
it
has
not
made
post-entry
sexual
deviation
of
ground
for
deportation,
at
least
not
at
the
time
that
this
case
--
that
the
matter
pertain
to
the
petitioner.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
deportation
may
be
had
only
for
grounds
specifically
expressed
in
the
statute.
the
immigration
amendment
of
1965
added
to
the
exclusion
statute
the
phrase
“sexual
deviation”.
it
added
nothing
to
the
deportation
section
if
the
effect
of
the
government's
order
is
to
deport
petitioner
for
something
which
the
statute
gave
him
no
notice
at
the
time
of
entry.
respondent's
obvious
that
the
use
of
legislative
history
is
permissible
to
clarify
statutory
language.
and
thus,
with
the
aid
of
relevant
legislative
history,
the
term
psychopathic
personality
is
embracing
homosexual
conduct
becomes
clear
and
definite.
now,
resort
to
legislative
history
is
meaningful
and
at
times
necessary
but
only
when
the
statute
on
its
face
is
not
sufficiently
clear.
the
term
psychopathic
personality,
however,
is
not
ambiguous.
it
is
not
--
it
is
known
and
established
medical
nomenclature
denoting
a
medical
condition
and
it
is
fully
defined
in
medical
literature.
when
courts
have
looked
to
legislative
history,
it
has
been
to
clarify
statutory
construction,
not
to
rewrite
the
statute
and
create
new
and
different
provisions.
for
example,
in
the
very
recent
case
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
against
--
service
against
errico.
the
court,
in
the
current
term,
examined
the
legislative
history
at
section
241
of
the
immigration
--
241
(f)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
that
section
bars
the
deportation
of
an
alien
who
gain
permanent
admission
to
the
united
states
to
the
perpetuation
of
a
fraud
provided
the
alien
is
an
immediate
relative
of
a
united
state
citizen.
now,
the
court
reviewed
legislative
history,
not
to
make
the
term
“fraud”
means
something
that
intrinsically
is
not
fraudulent,
but
to
determine
whether
the
proved
acts
of
fraud
in
that
case
were
the
kind
that
were
contemplated
and
wherein
the
word
--
within
the
intent
of
the
legislative
history.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
respondent
resorts
to
legislative
history,
not
to
determine
whether
a
proved
medical
condition
of
psychopathic
personality
was
intended
to
be
included
under
the
statute.
on
the
contrary,
legislative
intent
is
being
used
here
by
the
respondent
to
escape
proving
its
burden
that
the
homosexual
acts
by
the
petitioner
constituted
a
psychopathic
personality.
and
it
is
this
rewriting
of
the
history
that
makes
this
constitu
--
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
congress
unconstitutional.
ms.
blanch
freedman
if
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
is
an
alien
of
canadian
nationality.
he
is
33
years
old,
was
duly
admitted
to
the
united
states
for
permanent
residence
in
june
1955
when
he
was
21.
he
has
lived
in
the
united
states
ever
since,
working
--
and
working
here,
always
self-supporting.
by
occupation,
he
is
a
building
maintenance
operator.
he
resides
in
new
york
city
with
his
mother,
who
was
a
naturalized
citizen
and
stepfather,
also
a
citizen.
his
father
is
dead.
and
in
addition,
he
has
a
large
family
of
married
brothers
and
sisters
who
lived
in
this
country
with
their
respective
spouses
and
children.
petitioner
appeals
from
an
order
of
deportation
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
below
that
is
the
second
circuit.
the
order
is
predicated
upon
the
combined
operation
of
two
provisions
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
law.
section
241
(a)
(1)
of
the
1952
act,
which
renders
an
alien
deportable
if
at
the
time
of
admission
he
was
excludable.
and
to
section
212
(a)
(4)
of
the
act
which
makes
excludable
an
alien
who
at
the
time
of
entry
is
“afflicted
with
a
psychopathic
personality,
epilepsy
or
mental
defect.”
now,
the
responding
charges
that
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
entry
in
1955
was
afflicted
with
a
psychopathic
personality
namely
sexual
deviant
to
which
homosexual.
the
finding
of
psychopathic
personality
rests
solely
and
exclusively
upon
admissions
by
petitioner
of
having
engaged
in
homosexual
acts
before
but
principally,
after
entry.
the
evidence
of
record
is,
that
prior
entry
in
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21,
he
had
have
about
three
to
four
experiences
a
year
during
which
time
he
also
engaged
in
heterosexual
experiences.
after
entry
and
up
to
the
time
he
was
directed
to
appear
before
the
immigration
service
some
nine
years
later,
his
homosexual
activities
averaged
about
four
or
three
times
a
year.
these
admissions
were
made
by
the
petitioner
at
the
immigration
service
upon
interrogation
by
an
immigrant
inspector
in
january
1964
and
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
question
and
answer
statement.
on
this
statement
of
admissions
of
homosexual
activity
before
but
largely
after
entry,
and
of
no
medical
evidence
of
any
kind,
the
united
states
public
health
service
forthwith
certified
that
at
the
time
of
entry,
almost
ten
years
prior,
petitioner
was
excludable
as
an
alien
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
namely,
homosexual.
at
the
deportation
hearing,
petitioner
submitted
into
evidence
two
medical
reports
of
two
imminent
psychiatrists,
who
had
examined
him
personally
each
a
year
apart
and
independently
of
the
other.
the
medical
evidence
of
the
record
establishes
that
the
petitioner
is
not
psychotic;
that
the
petitioner
is
not
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality.
there
is
no
counter-medical
evidence
in
the
case.
on
the
contrary,
respondent
admits
that
it
has
not
proved
to
furnish
evidence
that
petitioner
is
psychopathic.
instead,
respondent
claims
that
such
medical
evidence
is
not
required
of
it
because
it
construes
and
applies
the
language
of
the
statute
that
is
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
to
mean,
an
alien
who
indulges
in
homosexual
conduct,
even
though
such
conduct
is
medically
unassociated
with
psychopathic
personality
or
any
other
medical
condition.
the
respondent
claims
that
its
construction
of
the
law
is
based
upon
it
speedily
that
that
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
enacted
the
1952
immigration
act.
in
short,
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
term
psychopathic
personality
may
mean
to
the
whole
world,
to
the
congress
that
enacted
it,
it
was
merely
a
rubric,
a
rubric
by
which
homosexuals
were
to
be
excluded
from
the
country.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
it
is
this
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statute
to
him
that
engenders
constitutional
infirmity.
as
construed
and
applied,
the
statute
is
vague,
indefinite
and
denied
petitioner
due
process
of
law.
because
one,
it
contains
no
boundaries,
no
standards,
no
guide
for
its
enforcement.
and
two,
because
it
failed
to
give
petitioner
adequate
notice
that
his
homosexual
behavior
after
entry
could
be
used
to
establish
the
alleged
excludable
condition,
psychopathic
personality
at
entry.
the
constitutional
deficiencies
that
stemmed
from
respondent's
interpretation
and
administration
of
the
statute
led
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
fleuti
against
rosenberg
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional.
and
thereafter
that
--
that
court
affirmed
its
decision
in
the
very
recent
case
of
lavoie
against
the
immigration
service
that
is
now
pending
before
this
court
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
the
facts
and
issues
in
the
fleuti,
lavoie
and
the
instant
case
are
the
same.
the
major
problem
that
underlies
the
respondent's
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
the
actual
language
of
section
212
(a)
(4)
is
medical
terminology
and
in
design
and
purpose
relates
to
the
exclusions
of
aliens
afflicted
with
a
condition
that
medically
can
be
diagnosed
a
psychopathic
personality
whereas
homosexuality
or
homosexual
--
or
homosexual
relates
to
conduct,
to
behavior.
there
is
no
homosexual
condition
per
se,
thereof
homosexual
acts.
of
course,
a
person
who
engages
in
homosexual
practices
may
be
a
psychopathic
personality
but
psychopathology
cannot
be
inferred
automatically
from
homosexual
practices.
ms.
blanch
freedman
alone.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
sir.
ms.
blanch
freedman
oh,
no,
sir.
i
come
to
that.
i
believe
the
--
we
do

and
we
so
state
in
our
second
point.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
on
the
contrary,
sir.
we
say
psychopathic
personality
as
it
appears
in
that
statute
has
a
describable
and
ascertainable
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
if
i'm
doing
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
then
we
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
however,
sir,
as
i
will
come
to
it,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
respondent
has
interpreted
the
constitutional
history
correctly.
i
mean,
that
that
is
the
legislative
history.
now,
that
--
you
cannot
deduce
from
homosexual
activity
alone.
a
psychopathic
condition
or
psychopathic
personality
is
not
only
the
opinion
of
the
enumerable
side
--
authority
cited
in
counsel's
brief
and
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
homosexual
lower
form
society,
which
is
before
this
court.
it
is
also
the
opinion
of
doctor
paul
g.
smith,
the
senior
service
surgeon
of
the
united
states
public
health
service
and
chief
in
psychiatry
at
the
public
health
service
hospital
at
new
york.
now,
dr.
smith
testified
in
the
matter
of
(inaudible).
he
had
also
testified
so
--
that
is
certified
the
alien
in
that
case
to
be
a
psychopathic
personality
under
facts
that
are
similar
to
his
certification
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
yet
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
he
testified
that
he
was
in
accord
with
medical
opinion
that
sex
deviate
is
not
ipso
facto,
a
psychopathic
personality.
he
agreed
that
to
arrive
at
such
a
medical
finding,
there
must
be
something
more
than
sexual
deviation.
the
doctor
was
then
asked
how
we
reconciled
his
certification
of
the
alien
of
the
psychopathic
personality
with
his
professional
opinion
and
to
this
he
replied
and
i
quote,
“that
as
a
qualified
physician,
he
was
fully
in
accord
with
modern
psychiatric
theory
but
that
as
an
employee
of
the
united
states
public
health
service,
he
was
bound
by
any
instruction
of
the
organization
addressed
to
his
employees.
thus,
it
is
evident
from
knowledgeable
sources
than
in
the
given
situation
whether
the
homosexual
conduct
denotes
an
excludable
pathologic
condition
is
a
matter
to
be
established
only
by
competent
examination
of
the
alien
by
qualified
physicians
and
not
merely
upon
admissions
of
homosexual
practices
that
have
been
extracted
by
an
immigrant
inspec
--
inspector
upon
interrogation
with
the
view
to
possible
deportation.”
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
actually
substitutes
homosexual
behavior
for
the
psychopathic
condition
stated
in
the
law
and
it
is
this
very
substitution
that
creates
the
vagueness
in
which
the
law
is
left
without
enforcement
of
the
admi
--
of
the
administrato
--
of
administrative
interpretation
without
guidelines,
without
boundaries,
without
tests
of
any
kind.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
was
done
in
october
of
1965.
that
was
several
years
after
--
many
years
after
the
situation
that
relates
to
this
case.
ms.
blanch
freedman
well,
clearly,
they're
expressing
then
i
would
say
doubts
that
prevailed
in
the
section
--
that
prevailed
in
the
statute,
if
that
is
what
they
are
clarifying.
but
of
course,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
accept
a
clarification
of
this
congress
to
what
the
1952
congress
really
had
in
mind.
ms.
blanch
freedman
they
never
said
that.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
it
is
enumerated
as
a
separate
category.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
sir.
they
say
that
is
in
response
to
--
that
is
the
reaction
of
the
1965
congress
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
to
the
fleuti
decision.
ms.
blanch
freedman
counsel
for
the
government
is
not
wholly
unmindful
that
there
are
no
boundaries
and
there
are
no
real
test/criteria
and
so
they
say
in
their
brief
on
page
36,
“there
may
indeed
be
cases
where
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
and
in
precisely
what
sense
an
individual
should
be
deemed
homosexual
within
the
intent
of
the
statute”.
now,
we
submit,
one
may
rightfully
ask
by
what
standard
or
test
the
government
determined
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
should
be
deemed
a
homosexual
within
the
intent
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
respondent.
now,
there
is
no
answer
disclosed
and
their
brief
is
significantly
silent.
now,
assuming
as
respondent
contends
and
congress
intended
to
bar
homosexuals
from
to
for
from
immigration,
we
are
still
left
without
an
adequate
standard
or
criteria
to
determine
whom
the
label
“homosexual”
covers
because
the
term
“homosexual”
does
not
described
an
ascertainable
condition.
at
best
it
denotes
a
category
and
that
category
is
also
undefined
and
lacking
insufficient
specificity
to
withstand
the
constitutional
challenge
of
vagueness.
but
this
difficulty,
this
lack
of
standard
does
not
exist
when
the
statute
is
enforced
as
agrees
and
as
we
believe
congress
mandated.
within
the
homosexual
behavior
that
is
reached
for
exclusion
under
the
law,
is
that
which
is
medically
ascertainable
and
found
to
be
pathologic,
namely,
that
denotes
a
psychopathic
personality.
the
second
aspect
of
the
statute's
vagueness
that
results
from
respondent's
construction
and
application
is
that
it
fails
to
apprise
petitioner
of
what
respondent
now
claims
made
him
excludable
in
1955
and
further
failed
to
advice
him
that
post-entry
homosexual
behavior
could
be
made
the
basis
for
his
expulsion
from
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
indicate
to
petitioner
at
entry
that
psychopathic
personality
meant
homosexual
or
sex
deviant.
the
words
homosexual
or
sex
deviant
or
sexual
perversion,
do
not
appear
either
in
the
exclusion
statute
or
in
the
deportation
statute.
furthermore,
there
was
nothing
in
the
visa
application
that
petitioner
was
obliged
to
execute
in
montreal,
canada
that
in
anyway
gave
him
any
warning.
the
visa
application
lists
all
the
excludable
classes
but
it
makes
no
mention
homosexual,
sex
deviants.
in
fact,
it
does
not
even
list
the
term
psychopathic
personality.
the
law
may
attribute
to
petitioner
knowledge
that
the
statute
excluded
from
admission
psych
--
first
aliens
with
psychopathic
personality.
but
how
can
he
be
charged
with
knowing
what
is
not
a
fact.
that
indulgence
in
homosexual
practices
means
that
one
is
so
afflicted.
to
urge
now
as
respondent
does
that
notice
and
warning
can
be
found
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
the
particular
committee
report,
i
submit,
strict
as
a
legal
presumption
of
knowledge
beyond
legality.
we
submit,
where
forfeiture
of
residence
is
predicated
upon
conduct
held
to
be
proscribed
or
utilized
as
the
basis
of
depriving
an
alien
of
the
right
to
remain
here.
due
process
requires
that
that
statute
be
clear
on
its
face.
this
is
supported
by
the
united
states
against
harris,
as
supported
by
jordan
against
de
george.
it's
supported
by
this
court
by
the
application
and
rationale
of
the
recent
case
by
this
court
in
giacco
against
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
in
theory,
petitioner's
post-entry
conduct
is
not
the
ground
for
his
deportation.
however,
it
was
the
persuasive
evidence
to
establish
that
--
to
establish
the
alleged
excludable
condition
and
entry
and
that
the
bottoms
the
finding
of
deportability
against
petitioner.
the
government's
odd
disclaimer
of
the
use
and
reliance
upon
post-entry
conduct
in
this
case
i
submit,
it's
truly
errant
and
non-sense.
permit
me
to
cite
that
one
example
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
his
entry
was
in
'55.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
his
entry
in
'55.
ms.
blanch
freedman
to
that,
may
i
submit
the
following
thoughts
for
this
court.
the
medical
evidence
and
it
is
supported
in
the
brief
by
our
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
there's
no
contest
that
he
admitted
certain
acts.
there
was
no
contest
--
contest
that
he
described
himself
when
he
was
asked,
“do
you
consider
yourself
a
homosexual?
”
ms.
blanch
freedman
no.
there
was
no
issue.
ms.
blanch
freedman
there
really
was
no
issue
tendered
because
whether
or
not
someone
is
a
homosexual
is
something
that
can
only
be
--
even
that
issue
can
only
be
described
medically
and
that
has
never
been
done
in
this
case.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
absolutely
correct,
sir.
the
government
--
i
want
to
quote
from
the
respondent's
brief
page
50,
the
last
paragraph
because
the
government
says,
they
did
not
use,
they've
made
no
reliance
upon
post-entry
conduct
and
this
is
just
one
example
of
how
--
of
how
it
operates,
“the
evidence
was
in
fact
overwhelming
and
undisputed.
the
government
established
that
the
hearing
through
petitioner's
own
admission
under
oath
that
beginning
about
1949,
six
years
prior
to
his
entry
actually
it
was
only
five
years
prior,
and
continuing
on
uninterruptedly
to
the
date
of
the
sworn
statement,
january
1964,
petitioner
had
regularly
engaged
on
an
average
of
three
or
four
times
a
year
of
homosexual
behavior.”
this
pattern
of
activity
extended
over
an
instable
of
14
and
one-half
years,
expands
the
date
of
entry.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
a
factual
statement.
but
clearly,
it
was
not
petitioner's
admission
of
three
to
four
homosexual
experiences
a
year
over
the
five
year
period
prior
his
entry.
that
really
motivated
the
deportation
proceedings
against
him
rather
it
was
his
post-entry
conduct
over
the
ensuing
nine-and-a-half
years.
now,
the
constitutional
significance
of
this,
of
this
use
to
post-entry
homosexual
act
is
that
in
this
case,
they
may
well
have
been
avoided.
had
petitioner
been
informed
by
the
statute
that
they
could
be
used
to
establish
a
pre-entry
condition
of
psychopathic
personality
for
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
petitioner's
experiences
were
compulsive
and
not
of
choice.
petitioner
could
have
and
in
all
probability
would
have
refrained
from
such
practices
from
the
time
of
entry
as
he
has
since
these
proceedings
first
gave
him
notice
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
this
statute.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that's
right.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
and
certainly
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
they
have
it
--
i'm
not
too
sure
on
the
criminal
law
whether
--
or
whether
just
to
what
extent
it
is.
i
know
we
do
have
a
law
of
sodomy
in
new
york
but
the
fact
that
he
has
never
been
convicted.
dr.
montague
ullman,
who
was
the
director
of
psychiatric
services
in
minority
hospital
in
brooklyn
and
professor
of
psychiatry
at
the
state
university
of
new
york,
examined
the
petitioner
in
march
of
1964.
and
in
his
report,
he
states
and
i'm
now
quoting
to
what
appears
in
the
record
on
page
15
and
16,
“the
patient
has
sexual
interest
in
girls
and
has
had
intercourse
with
them
on
a
number
of
occasions.”
then
skipping
in
taking
the
next
sentence,
“he
has
abandoned
all
sexual
practices
within
the
past
several
months
because
of
his
annoyance
and
disgusts
with
the
problems
these
activities
have
brought
about.
his
sexual
structure
still
appears
fluid
and
immature
so
that
he
moves
from
homosexual
to
heterosexual
interest
as
well
as
abstinence
with
almost
equal
facility.”
as
i
said
before,
the
span
of
14
years
of
homosexual
activity
that
the
respondent
talks
about,
nine-and-a-half
years
had
been
post-entry.
and
as
the
court
in
the
fleuti
case
recent
whether
a
finding
of
deportability
would
have
been
entered
against
petitioner
in
1965
based
on
the
pre-entry
conduct
prior
to
1955
or
even
whether
on
such
facts
the
charge
could
have
--
would
have
been
brought
is
a
matter
of
high
speculation.
the
facts,
however,
that
post-entry
behavior
is
relied
upon
is
some
indication
that
the
charge
might
not
have
been
filed
or
a
finding
entered
on
free
entry
behavior
alone.
respondent
proffers
to
answers
to
petitioner's
charge
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
adequate
notice.
first,
respondent
says,
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
fair
warning
because
that
doctrine
is
aimed
at
regulating
conduct,
and
now
i
quote
from
their
brief
on
page
42,
“that
the
fair
warning
doctrine
is
not
a
device
to
enable
an
individual
afflicted
with
a
condition
that
if
discovered
would
have
barred
his
admission
to
this
country
and
to
so
conducthimself
as
to
avoid
this
condition
becoming
known
to
administrative
authorities”.
and
that,
we
submit,
completely
reveals
the
failure
or
the
emptiness
of
the
government's
argument.
surely,
the
respondent
in
this
case
cannot
have
it
both
ways
because
it
is
precisely
that
there
was
a
lack
of
proof
of
condition
--
of
conditions,
psychopathic
personality.
either
before
or
after
entry
that
this
petitioner
has
been
urging
throughout
and
it
is
the
respondent
who
has
been
insisting
that
it
is
not
concerned
about
petitioner's
condition,
it
knows
how
he
is
behaved
and
that
that
is
sufficient.
the
point
is
that,
where
petitioner's
condition
is
involved
here
it
could
not
be
hidden.
but
if
behavior
is
involved,
then
it
could
have
been
controlled
by
him
that
in
fact
he
does
not
suffer
from
any
condition.
had
respondent
applied
the
statute
to
petitioner
as
it
reads
and
as
we
contend
it
should
be,
namely,
whether
petitioner
was
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
that
would
be
addressed
to
condition?
but
as
to
condition,
respondent
has
offered
no
proof
and
so
admits.
but
the
fact
is
that,
respondent
has
administered
the
statute
as
applying
to
petitioner's
condition
to
beha
--
the
petitioner's
behavior.
and
thus,
the
failure
of
the
statute
as
construed
and
applied
denied
him
the
opportunity
of
knowingly
refraining
from
engaging
in
certain
conduct.
this
is
not
to
hide
a
condition.
petitioner
has
concealed
nothing
because
he
has
no
condition.
this
is
really
to
regulate
behavior
if
the
impact
of
the
statute
demanded
it.
respondent's
other
answer
to
the
issue
of
fair
warning
is
that
since
congress
could
retroactively
make
homosexual
conduct
a
ground
for
deportation,
it
could
also
make
future
homosexual
conduct
in
this
country
by
an
alien,
a
cause
for
his
deportation
whether
or
not
its
intentions
were
expressed
clearly
though
congress
may
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
hasn't.
it
has
not
made
post-entry
sexual
deviation
of
ground
for
deportation,
at
least
not
at
the
time
that
this
case
--
that
the
matter
pertain
to
the
petitioner.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
deportation
may
be
had
only
for
grounds
specifically
expressed
in
the
statute.
the
immigration
amendment
of
1965
added
to
the
exclusion
statute
the
phrase
“sexual
deviation”.
it
added
nothing
to
the
deportation
section
if
the
effect
of
the
government's
order
is
to
deport
petitioner
for
something
which
the
statute
gave
him
no
notice
at
the
time
of
entry.
respondent's
obvious
that
the
use
of
legislative
history
is
permissible
to
clarify
statutory
language.
and
thus,
with
the
aid
of
relevant
legislative
history,
the
term
psychopathic
personality
is
embracing
homosexual
conduct
becomes
clear
and
definite.
now,
resort
to
legislative
history
is
meaningful
and
at
times
necessary
but
only
when
the
statute
on
its
face
is
not
sufficiently
clear.
the
term
psychopathic
personality,
however,
is
not
ambiguous.
it
is
not
--
it
is
known
and
established
medical
nomenclature
denoting
a
medical
condition
and
it
is
fully
defined
in
medical
literature.
when
courts
have
looked
to
legislative
history,
it
has
been
to
clarify
statutory
construction,
not
to
rewrite
the
statute
and
create
new
and
different
provisions.
for
example,
in
the
very
recent
case
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
against
--
service
against
errico.
the
court,
in
the
current
term,
examined
the
legislative
history
at
section
241
of
the
immigration
--
241
(f)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
that
section
bars
the
deportation
of
an
alien
who
gain
permanent
admission
to
the
united
states
to
the
perpetuation
of
a
fraud
provided
the
alien
is
an
immediate
relative
of
a
united
state
citizen.
now,
the
court
reviewed
legislative
history,
not
to
make
the
term
“fraud”
means
something
that
intrinsically
is
not
fraudulent,
but
to
determine
whether
the
proved
acts
of
fraud
in
that
case
were
the
kind
that
were
contemplated
and
wherein
the
word
--
within
the
intent
of
the
legislative
history.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
respondent
resorts
to
legislative
history,
not
to
determine
whether
a
proved
medical
condition
of
psychopathic
personality
was
intended
to
be
included
under
the
statute.
on
the
contrary,
legislative
intent
is
being
used
here
by
the
respondent
to
escape
proving
its
burden
that
the
homosexual
acts
by
the
petitioner
constituted
a
psychopathic
personality.
and
it
is
this
rewriting
of
the
history
that
makes
this
constitu
--
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
congress
unconstitutional.
