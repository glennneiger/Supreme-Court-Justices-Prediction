justice
potter
stewart
to
the
fleuti
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
your
claim
was
--
perhaps
something
at
the
amicus
brief
with
that
word
is
an
adjective
and
not
a
noun.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it's
inaccurate
to
use
it
as
a
noun
and
that
there's
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
his
having
engaged
in
some
homosexual
acts
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
that
or
activity
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
he
even
medically,
insofar
as
this
statutory
language
has
a
medical
meaning,
it
falls
under
that
definition
within
that
meaning,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
question
about
that
as
a
factual
statement,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
these
practices
he
lived
--
he's
lived
in
new
york,
hasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
practices
are
criminal
under
the
law
of
new
york,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
claim
is
not
only
that
the
--
that
the
statutory
phrases
not
sufficiently
specific,
it's
--
that
it's
not
sufficiently
accurate.
it
doesn't
say
what
congress
--
what
you
say
congress
intended
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
extent
of
that
word
it
has
meaning
but
it
may
have
no
meaning.
he'd
engaged
in
heterosexual
acts
and
he'd
engaged
in
homosexual
acts,
both,
and
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there's
no
argument
about
those
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
--
do
you
understand
the
present
statute,
sexual
deviation
to
refer
to
condition
or
to
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
should
be
ready
to
wait.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
it's
whether
or
not
meaning
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
also,
of
course,
i
presume
would
include
that
sexual
deviation
other
than
and
in
addition
to
homosexual
sexual
deviation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
administratively,
not
talking
about
the
new
amendment
but
the
statute
as
we
have
it
here.
what
other
people
have
ever
been
excluded
under
this?
justice
potter
stewart
really,
this
is
--
this
is
that
--
these
are
the
only
people
excluded
frankly
speaking,
aren't
they?
or
it
had
been
deported?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
isn't
it
--
only
homosexuals
and
people
who'd
been
--
who
have
engaged
in
homosexual
conduct
and
only
such
people
who
have
been
thought
to
be
covered
by
this,
am
i
right
about
that
or
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
of
some
importance.
i
mean
the
question,
does
this
mean
--
is
this
a
code
word
--
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
a
code
word?
meaning,
people
who
have
engaged
in
homosexual
conduct
or
is
this
a
broad
class
within
which
broad
and
definable
class
within
which
falls
such
people?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
then
if
we
find
that
only
homosexual
that
had
people
engaged
in
homosexual
conduct
had
been
excluded,
then
it
isn't
a
broad
class
and
it's
a
code
word
for
something
else,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
deported?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
you
read?
justice
potter
stewart
with
minimal
subjective
anxiety
and
little
or
no
distress.
i
should
think
they
are
covered
by
anybody,
who
was
well.

potter
stewart

i
--
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the

the

asked
you
that.

have

you
can't

me
what
was

i'd
