mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
two
questions
are
presented
for
decision
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
by
providing
in
section
212
(a)
(4)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
for
the
exclusion
from
the
united
states
of
aliens
who
are
“afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality”.
congress
intended
to
encompass
within
those
terms
an
individual-like
petitioner,
who
had
engaged
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21
in
homosexual
relations
on
an
average
of
three
or
four
times
a
year
and
who
was
found
by
a
public
health
service
physicians
and
psychiatrists
to
be
a
“sexual
deviate”
at
the
time
of
his
entry
into
the
united
states
in
1955.
the
second
question
is
whether
if
congress
did
so
intend,
its
use
of
the
words
“afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality”
rather
than
more
specific
words
directed
to
homosexual
propensities
or
other
deviations
from
normal
sexual
practice,
make
it
constitutionally
impermissible
to
apply
that
statute
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
to
that
extend,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
think
that
that's
really
something
that
prevailed
petitioner's
basic
argument.
we
think
that
his
dispute
is
really
with
congress
and
not
--
and
not
with
the
courts
as
it
were
because
the
legislative
history,
we
submit,
is
entirely
clear
that
no
matter
what
psychiatrists
or
the
way
to
view
among
psychiatrists
may
be
today
as
to
whether
homosexuality
is
a
condition
or
can
merely
be
used
as
an
adjective
to
describe
a
practice.
the
legislative
history,
we
think
is
entirely
clear
that
congress
did
consider
the
condition
and
that
congress
intended
to
encompass
that
condition
within
the
words
it
used
in
the
statute.
so
that
if
in
fact
petitioner
is
contending
that
congress
mislabeled
whatever
it
was
trying
or
whomever
it
was
trying
to
exclude,
that's
because
--
that
would
be
true
no
matter
what
the
statute
said.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
retained
its
original
proposed
language
in
the
statute
and
excluded
specifically
homosexuals
or
sex
perverts,
we
assume
petitioner
would
still
be
here
saying
that
that's
an
inaccurate
description
of
whatever
it
is
that
--
that
he
is
afflicted
with.
but
we
just
think
that
that's
exactly
what
congress
sits
for,
to
determine
disputes
among
psychiatrists
and
among
experts
in
this
kind
of
an
area.
and
that
if
there
are
disputes
among
the
psychiatrists
as
to
what
proper
way
of
labeling
somebody
who
regularly
engaged
in
homosexual
activity
is?
congress
decided
on
the
basis
of
recommendations
by
the
public
health
service
that
it
was
a
condition,
a
pathological
condition,
and
that
it
want
to
exclude
the
people
who
had
that
conditions
from
the
united
states
as
immigrants.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
it
first
introduced
in
the
congress,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
senate
had
specific
provision
which
read
that,
aliens
excludable
include
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
public
health
service
recommendation
that
the
specific
provision
for
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts
was
dropped,
and
just
the
words
referring
to
“afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality”
retained
in
the
act
as
it
was
ultimately
passed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
we
relied
on,
mr.
justice
fortas,
not
merely
on
the
public
health
service
recommendation
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
the
sentence
following
the
one
that
you've
just
read
because
we
think
that's
really
more
clear.
but
we
also
rely,
on
how
the
senate
construed
the
public
health
service
recommendation.
let
me
first
turn
to
that
first
thing
of
the
following
sentence.
the
public
health
service
did
say
that
ordinarily
persons
suffering
from
disturbances
are
included
within
the
classification
of
psychopathic
personality
with
pathologic
sexuality.
it
went
on
to
say,
this
classification
will
specify
such
types
of
pathologic
behavior
as
homosexuality
or
sexual
perversion
etcetera.
it
does
that
following
sentence
is
an
effect
the
statement
by
the
public
health
service
that
homosexuality
is
pathologic
behavior,
a
proposition
which
petitioner
basically
contests.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
now,
we
don't
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
don't
read
that
sentence
as
meaning
that
they
are
all
included
in
the
group.
we
think
that
what
the
public
health
service
was
saying
was,
if
you
use
the
word
“psychopathic
personality”,
you
will
cover
everyone
who
is
--
whom
you
intended
to
cover
by
the
words
homosexuals
or
sex
perverts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
may
be
people
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
but
we
even
--
accepting
certainly
as
i
do
that
the
public
health
service
recommendation
is
subject
to
differing
constructions.
more
relevant,
we
think
is
what
senate
--
the
senate
or
the
congressional
committees
understood
the
public
health
service
to
mean.
now,
the
senate
report,
which
we
quoted
pages
21
to
22
of
our
brief,
which
accompanied
the
revised
legislation
which
succeeded
that
upon
which
the
public
health
service
had
submitted
its
recommendation,
specifically
noted,
that
existing
law
did
not
provide
for
the
exclusions
of
homosexuals
or
sex
perverts.
that
the
prior
statute
that
had
been
introduced
in
the
senate
had
so
provided
that
the
public
health
service
has
advised
that
the
provisions
for
aliens
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
or
a
mental
defect
is
sufficiently
broad
to
provide
for
the
exclusion
of
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts,
not
some
homosexuals
or
not
the
majority
homosexuals
but
for
the
exclusion
of
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts.
and
what
we
think
is
the
really
clenching
evidence
is
the
concluding
sentence
of
that
particular
passage
in
the
senate
report
which
says,
“quite
specifically,
this
change
of
nomenclature
is
not
to
be
construed
in
anyway
as
modifying
the
intent
to
exclude
all
aliens
who
were
sexual
deviates.
not
merely
aliens
who
were
sexual
deviates
were
also
psychopathic
personalities
but
all
aliens
who
were
sexual
deviates.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
we
don't
think
so
and
we
don't
think
that
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
thinks
so,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
quite
clear
we
think
from
the
reported
cases
and
from
all
the
cases
that
we
know
of
that
immigration
services
acted
upon
that
that
they
don't
consider
one
or
any
sporadic
acts
of
homosexuality's
being
sufficient
to
bring
a
particular
alien
within
the
class.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
--
in
an
appendix
to
its
reported
decision
in
matter
of
p
in
7
i&n
decisions
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
quite
clearly
noted
that
the
fact
that
an
individual
performs
a
homosexual
act
does
not
immediately
classify
him
as
a
homosexual.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
is
based
upon
--
yes,
he
was.
there
was.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
--
yes,
sir.
there's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
there's
a
public
health
service
finding
on
the
basis
of
the
public
health
service
psychiatrist
and
doctors
examining
the
statements
of
the
petitioner.
and
very
specifically,
on
page
11
of
the
record,
that
that
certification
appears
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
contained
in
the
statement
which
is
petitioner's
own
statement
of
--
his
own
history,
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
alien
was
afflicted
with
a
class
a
condition
namely,
psychopathic
personality,
sexual
deviate
at
the
time
of
his
admission
to
the
united
states.
so
that
the
standards
that
the
immigration
service
is
applying
is
not
the
one
that
switch
across
the
board
to
anybody
who
is
committed
a
single
or
very
sporadic
homosexual
acts
in
his
lifetime
but
to
one
who,
as
this
petitioner
did,
engaged
in
as
a
--
as
a
regular
practice.
and
indeed,
we
think
that
the
evidence,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
noted
in
petitioner's
argument,
it
wasn't
even
contested
as
to
whether
he
really
was
a
“homosexual”
to
the
extent
that
that
word
has
meaning
to
the
extent
that
congress,
we
submit,
wanted
it
to
have
meaning
that
he
was
a
homosexual
at
the
time
of
entry.
indeed,
he
admitted
as
much.
he
said
as
much
in
his
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
far
more
of
the
former,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there's
no
argument
about
those
facts
but
there's
also
no
argument
that
he
himself
said
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
selective
service
board
that
he
was
homosexual
and
that
he
received
a
correct
classification
on
that
basis,
so
that
the
petitioner
himself
is
not
attempting
in
anyway
to
challenge
that
kind
of
a
finding.
true,
it
may
to
be
sure,
we
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
the
very
word
“homosexual”
has
vague
--
certain
vague
meanings
as
it
paraphrased.
all
that
we
argue
is
that
congress
made
it
clear
that
that
to
the
extent
that
that
word
does
have
meaning,
it
wished
to
have
aliens
who
were
--
who
didn't
meet
that
condition
excluded
from
entry
into
the
united
states.
going
--
now,
if
i
may
to
the
constitutional
issue,
which
is
whether
section
212
(a)
(4)
is
unconstitutionally
vague
as
applied
to
this
situation
because
the
words
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
are
too
indefinite
to
provide
a
warning
to
aliens
or
a
guide
to
administrators
in
courts.
we
submit
that
there's
no
constitutional
defect
to
this
language.
first,
because
warning
in
the
sense
that
it's
usually
thought
of
in
the
constitutional
sense
which
is
necessary
for
criminal
and
certain
kinds
of
civil
statute
is
irrelevant
to
the
kind
of
determination
that
has
to
be
made
here.
and
second,
because
we
think
that
the
legislative
histories
provide
sufficient
content
to
the
word
“psychopathic
personality”,
to
ensure
a
fair
and
even-handed
administration
by
those
who
were
responsible
for
administering
the
act
and
by
the
courts.
i
say
warning
is
irrelevant
because
the
statute
does
not
on
its
face
or
in
the
manner
of
its
administration
purport
to
regulate
how
an
alien
is
to
act
after
he
enters
the
united
states.
all
that
it
does
is
that
it
excludes
aliens,
who
fit
certain
statutory
descriptions
at
the
time
that
they
seek
to
enter.
the
question
before
the
immigration
officer
and
the
boards
of
appeal
and
the
courts
was
whether
petitioner
was
“homosexual”
at
the
time
he
entered
the
united
states
in
1955.
now
with
all
the
warning
in
the
world,
assuming
that
that
statute
have
been
as
clear
as
it
could
have
been,
petitioner
could
not
have
changed
that
statute.
now,
of
course
its
true,
petitioner
might
as
judge
moore
pointed
out
in
a
dissenting
opinion
below,
have
acted
differently
after
his
arrival
in
the
united
states
and
thereby
not
provided
evidence
which
would
corroborate
the
conclusion
that
that
would
have
been
arrived
at
in
any
event
from
his
own
history
of
his
conduct
before
he
entered
the
united
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
as
a
practical
fact,
of
course,
mr.
justice
brennan
the
only
way
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh!
it
did.
it
definitely
did
have
considerable
relevance.
but
we
think
that
the
notion
of
fair
warning
has
never
been
thought
to
apply
to
evidence
as
it
were.
it's
--
people
subject
to
a
statute
are
entitled
to
be
warned
as
to
whether
they
conduct
they
engaged
in
is
lawful
or
is
not
lawful.
not
to
whether
the
conduct
they
engaged
and
may,
in
some
way,
provide
evidence
of
unlawful
activity
or
something
that
may
redound
to
their
detriment.
assume
for
example,
a
man
prepares
to
commit
a
crime
before
or
prepares
to
commit
certain
acts
which
were
made
criminal
after
he
begins
his
preparations.
i
think
there'd
be
no
question
but
that
the
beginning
acts
of
preparation
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
even
though
at
the
time
that
he
did
them
he
had
no
reason
to
know
that
the
conduct
he
ultimately
performed
was
criminal.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
warning.
you're
not
entitled
to
warning
in
order
to
conceal
from
government
official's
evidence,
conduct
which
may
in
some
way
show
that
either
you're
guilty
of
an
offense
or
that
something
would
result
that
would
be
to
your
detriment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
i
could
qualify
that,
i
think
it
would
be
right.
we're
not
making
that
argument
but
we
also
--
we
also
--
we
don't
necessarily
believe
that
it's
wrong.
we
say
it's
a
matter
of
dispute
among
psychiatrist.
in
other
words,
congress
did
not,
we
think
fly
in
the
face
of
psychiatric
testimony
when
it
said,
“this
is
conduct
which
could
be
classified
under
afflicted
with
a
psychopathic
personality”.
indeed,
some
of
the
responses
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
homosexual
were
formerly.
we
think
indicate
that
those
who
responded
believe
that
that
may
be
it
could
be
characterized.
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
we
did
in
our
brief
i
think
is
that
we
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
any
absolute
medical
knowledge
which
would
today
make
it
entirely
clear
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
psychopathic
personality.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
intended
to
say
that
congress
was
acting
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
try
to
be.
we're
not
--
in
other
words,
all
that
i'm
saying
is
--
or
all
that
we're
trying
to
say
here
is
that
congress
had
before
it
or
could
have
had
before
it
various
psychiatric
opinions.
it
apparently
chose
one
and
that's
perfectly
within
the
domain
of
the
legislature.
if
today
it
turns
out
that
that's
wrong
or
if
the
weight
the
psychiatric
opinion
to
the
contrary,
that
is
not
we
think
invalidate
the
statute
or
make
it
totally
inapplicable.
we
just
think
its
congress'
choices
among
expert
opinion
as
to
which
view
it
wants
to
pay.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
would
not
be
making
that
argument.
but
we
think
that
in
effect,
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
is
certainly
to
be
construed
--
it's
certainly
to
be
applied
no
less
and
that
the
statute
has
itself
said
of
aliens
afflicted
with
homosexuality.
now,
i
understand
petitioner's
counsel
to
be
arguing,
that
is
a
totally
inappropriate
characterization
in
any
event
because
homosexuality
could
not
be
a
condition.
we
submit
if
the
legislature
had
that
congress
had
so
stated,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
--
we
think
the
administrators
and
the
courts
to
get
content
to
the
extent
that
it's
possible
to
that
policy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
psychopathic.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
legislative
history
certainly
isn't
explicit
on
that.
i
can
only
guess
and
one
--
one
guess
certainly
could
be
precisely
what
we
were
discussing
here.
which
is
that
by
that
time
statute
was
amended,
congress
may
or
those
who
suggested
the
amendment
may
reasonably
if
had
some
doubt
as
to
whether
scientifically,
homosexuality
or
sexual
deviation
could
be
considered
a
form
of
psychopathic
personality.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think,
sir.
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
announces
or
i
think
congress
has
said
disjunctive,
“if
you
now
proceed
against
the
man
who
is
homosexual,
you
should
know
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
but
we
think
that
the
quotations
from
the
senate
report
which
accompany
that,
which
appear
in
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief,
we
think
do
make
it
clear
that
congress
was
not
intending
by
that
in
anyway
to
indicate
that
they
meant
anything
less
one
when
a
person
in
active
statute
in
52.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
it
refers
to
a
condition.
but
i
don't
think
it
can
be
afflicted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it
does
say
“afflicted”
and
i
think
afflicted
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
as
one
can
hardly
be
afflicted
with
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
what
he
has
done
in
the
past.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
and
to
that
extent,
it's
also
similar
to
what
the
initial
draft
of
the
1952
legislation
were
saying
that
because
that
covers
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts,
and
presumably
congress
says
somebody
other
than
homosexuals
when
specified
the
latter.
let
me
just
note
in
addition
a
point
which
the
--
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
during
the
petitioner's
argument,
which
is
that
so
far
as
the
fair
warning
point
is
concerned,
it's
quite
bizarre
to
think
of
fair
warning
in
the
context
of
conduct
which
is
unlawful
under
the
laws
of
50
states
and
it
was
unlawful
under
the
law
of
new
york
at
the
time
that
petitioner
engaged
in.
it's
hardly
likely
that
if
the
statute
had
been
far
more
explicit
in
stating
that
deportation
would
follow
a
showing
of
homosexuality
at
the
time
of
entry
in
the
united
states,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
be
anymore
deterred
from
this
kind
of
conduct
and
by
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
criminal
statutes
on
the
books.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
that
to
that
extent,
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
suggestion
in
the
--
a
void
for
vagueness
argument
that
somebody
in
petitioner's
position
has
a
right
to
rely
on
what
he
knows
at
the
time
he
enters
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
flies
on
the
face
of
many,
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held,
affirmed,
and
reaffirmed
the
proposition
that
congress
may
retrospectively
legislate
with
regard
to
the
deportation
of
aliens
in
the
united
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
think
congress
should
be
but
we
think
that
--
to
that
extent,
we
think
the
gap
can
be
filled
by
legislative
history
because
it's
true.
as
so
far
as
the
petitioner
as
an
individual
is
concerned,
he
can't
be
expected
to
go
beyond
the
words
of
the
statute
if
he
can't
even
be
expected
to
read
the
statute
at
all.
what
we
think
that
the
administrators
have
available
legislative
history.
and
there's
no
suggestion
here,
that
the
administrators
have
gone
beyond
the
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts
which
congress
by
its
legislative
history
indicated
it
wanted
to
cover
by
this
language.
in
other
words,
if
these
were
a
case,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we're
--
if
we
were
on
the
boarder
line
of
something
which
congress
may
or
may
not
have
wanted,
then
we
think
that
the
decisions
which
say
that
a
statute
has
to
be
precise
and
specific
in
order
to
ensure
that
it
be
given
a
fair
and
even
handed
administration
would
apply.
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
words
in
the
statute
are
general
but
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
there
is
a
very
core
of
conditions
that
that
were
intended
to
be
covered
and
the
administrators
in
this
case
are
acting
within
that
core
of
conditions
intended
to
be
covered.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
excluded
from
initial
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
were
none
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
entry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
since
they've
added
sexual
deviation.
they
specifically
ask
whether
the
applicant
is
a
sexual
deviant.
they
don't
specifically
refer
to
homosexuality
even
now.
they
just
say
sexual
deviant.
let
me
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know.
mr.
nathan
lewin
you
mean
un
--
yes.
all
you
think
--
under
the
psychopathic
personality
already?
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
really
couldn't
give
you
an
answer
to
that
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it's
a
broad
and
definable
class.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
they
may
have
been
the
only
ones
who
were
in
fact
excluded
but
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
or
deported.
let
me
point
out
one
fact
which
is
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
1952
act,
as
far
back
in
1917
immigration
act.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
statute
applying
to
con
--
persons
of
constitutional
psychopathic
inferiority.
now,
that
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
homosexuals
or
sexual
deviants
in
anyway
and
it
didn't
cover
that.
and
that
the
senate
report,
which
accompanied
the
original
draft
of
the
‘52
legislation,
pointed
that
out.
i've
just
been
referred
to
the
manual
for
medical
examination
of
aliens
which
the
public
health
service
has
and
they
do
define
psychopathic
personality
as
covering
any
personality
disorder
and
then
have
a
definition,
to
put
a
long
sentence
which
covers
certainly
more
than
sexual
deviates.
it
says,
these
disorders
are
characterized
by
developmental
defect
or
pathological
trends
in
the
personality
structure
with
minimal
subjective
anxiety
and
little
or
no
distress
and
so
on.
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
minimal
subjective
anxiety
and
little
or
no
distress.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
all
--
that's
all
of
course
qualified
by
the
introductory
clause
which
says
developmental
defects
or
pathological
trends
in
personality.
i
don't
know
how
you
show
a
pathological
trend
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
can't
say
but
i
will
supply
an
answer
and
i
will
find
that
out,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
will
set
up
an
answer
on
it.
if
i
might
just
return
for
a
minute
to
the
--
again
to
the
question
of
fair
warning
and
i
say
this
court
has
said
as
recently
in
the
1956
term
in
the
lehman
and
carson
case
and
mulcahey
and
catalanotte
in
353
u.s.
with
only
two
dissents
that
congress
may
legislate
retrospectively
with
regards
to
deportation
of
aliens
who
are
in
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
an
alien
in
the
united
states
who
enters
has
in
effect
a
revocable
license
here.
congress
may
but
act
reasonably
legislate
retrospectively
to
provide
first
deportation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
we
don't
read
that.
we
don't
read
the
65
statute
as
being
retrospective.
but
we're
just
saying,
this
is
an
answer
to
the
argument
which
petitioner
makes
and
which
mr.
justice
fortas
raised,
which
is,
that
this
man
relied
on
the
absence
of
any
clear
exclusionary
provision
in
the
statute.
we
think
he
has
no
constitutional
right
to
rely
on
that.
that
if
he
entered
the
united
states
and
did
not
know
of
this
but
later
it
was
point
out
to
him
that
by
reason
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
construction
and
application
of
the
statute
homosexuality
was
a
ground
for
excludability,
then,
he
could
be
excluded.
although,
he
thought
at
the
time
he
entered
and
at
the
time
he
committed
his
homosexual
acts
even
in
the
united
states
that
it
was
not
a
ground
for
deportation.
indeed
in
those
cases,
in
galvan
and
press
and
harisiades
v.
shaughnessy,
the
court
sustained
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
be
deported.
either
at
the
time
they
entered
the
united
states
or
at
the
time
they
committed
acts,
which
under
a
subsequent
statute
became
the
basis
for
their
deportation.
and
we
think
that
applies
in
these
circumstances
as
well.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
two
questions
are
presented
for
decision
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
by
providing
in
section
212
(a)
(4)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
for
the
exclusion
from
the
united
states
of
aliens
who
are
“afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality”.
congress
intended
to
encompass
within
those
terms
an
individual-like
petitioner,
who
had
engaged
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21
in
homosexual
relations
on
an
average
of
three
or
four
times
a
year
and
who
was
found
by
a
public
health
service
physicians
and
psychiatrists
to
be
a
“sexual
deviate”
at
the
time
of
his
entry
into
the
united
states
in
1955.
the
second
question
is
whether
if
congress
did
so
intend,
its
use
of
the
words
“afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality”
rather
than
more
specific
words
directed
to
homosexual
propensities
or
other
deviations
from
normal
sexual
practice,
make
it
constitutionally
impermissible
to
apply
that
statute
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
to
that
extend,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
think
that
that's
really
something
that
prevailed
petitioner's
basic
argument.
we
think
that
his
dispute
is
really
with
congress
and
not
--
and
not
with
the
courts
as
it
were
because
the
legislative
history,
we
submit,
is
entirely
clear
that
no
matter
what
psychiatrists
or
the
way
to
view
among
psychiatrists
may
be
today
as
to
whether
homosexuality
is
a
condition
or
can
merely
be
used
as
an
adjective
to
describe
a
practice.
the
legislative
history,
we
think
is
entirely
clear
that
congress
did
consider
the
condition
and
that
congress
intended
to
encompass
that
condition
within
the
words
it
used
in
the
statute.
so
that
if
in
fact
petitioner
is
contending
that
congress
mislabeled
whatever
it
was
trying
or
whomever
it
was
trying
to
exclude,
that's
because
--
that
would
be
true
no
matter
what
the
statute
said.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
retained
its
original
proposed
language
in
the
statute
and
excluded
specifically
homosexuals
or
sex
perverts,
we
assume
petitioner
would
still
be
here
saying
that
that's
an
inaccurate
description
of
whatever
it
is
that
--
that
he
is
afflicted
with.
but
we
just
think
that
that's
exactly
what
congress
sits
for,
to
determine
disputes
among
psychiatrists
and
among
experts
in
this
kind
of
an
area.
and
that
if
there
are
disputes
among
the
psychiatrists
as
to
what
proper
way
of
labeling
somebody
who
regularly
engaged
in
homosexual
activity
is?
congress
decided
on
the
basis
of
recommendations
by
the
public
health
service
that
it
was
a
condition,
a
pathological
condition,
and
that
it
want
to
exclude
the
people
who
had
that
conditions
from
the
united
states
as
immigrants.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
it
first
introduced
in
the
congress,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
senate
had
specific
provision
which
read
that,
aliens
excludable
include
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
public
health
service
recommendation
that
the
specific
provision
for
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts
was
dropped,
and
just
the
words
referring
to
“afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality”
retained
in
the
act
as
it
was
ultimately
passed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
we
relied
on,
mr.
justice
fortas,
not
merely
on
the
public
health
service
recommendation
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
the
sentence
following
the
one
that
you've
just
read
because
we
think
that's
really
more
clear.
but
we
also
rely,
on
how
the
senate
construed
the
public
health
service
recommendation.
let
me
first
turn
to
that
first
thing
of
the
following
sentence.
the
public
health
service
did
say
that
ordinarily
persons
suffering
from
disturbances
are
included
within
the
classification
of
psychopathic
personality
with
pathologic
sexuality.
it
went
on
to
say,
this
classification
will
specify
such
types
of
pathologic
behavior
as
homosexuality
or
sexual
perversion
etcetera.
it
does
that
following
sentence
is
an
effect
the
statement
by
the
public
health
service
that
homosexuality
is
pathologic
behavior,
a
proposition
which
petitioner
basically
contests.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
now,
we
don't
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
don't
read
that
sentence
as
meaning
that
they
are
all
included
in
the
group.
we
think
that
what
the
public
health
service
was
saying
was,
if
you
use
the
word
“psychopathic
personality”,
you
will
cover
everyone
who
is
--
whom
you
intended
to
cover
by
the
words
homosexuals
or
sex
perverts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
may
be
people
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
but
we
even
--
accepting
certainly
as
i
do
that
the
public
health
service
recommendation
is
subject
to
differing
constructions.
more
relevant,
we
think
is
what
senate
--
the
senate
or
the
congressional
committees
understood
the
public
health
service
to
mean.
now,
the
senate
report,
which
we
quoted
pages
21
to
22
of
our
brief,
which
accompanied
the
revised
legislation
which
succeeded
that
upon
which
the
public
health
service
had
submitted
its
recommendation,
specifically
noted,
that
existing
law
did
not
provide
for
the
exclusions
of
homosexuals
or
sex
perverts.
that
the
prior
statute
that
had
been
introduced
in
the
senate
had
so
provided
that
the
public
health
service
has
advised
that
the
provisions
for
aliens
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
or
a
mental
defect
is
sufficiently
broad
to
provide
for
the
exclusion
of
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts,
not
some
homosexuals
or
not
the
majority
homosexuals
but
for
the
exclusion
of
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts.
and
what
we
think
is
the
really
clenching
evidence
is
the
concluding
sentence
of
that
particular
passage
in
the
senate
report
which
says,
“quite
specifically,
this
change
of
nomenclature
is
not
to
be
construed
in
anyway
as
modifying
the
intent
to
exclude
all
aliens
who
were
sexual
deviates.
not
merely
aliens
who
were
sexual
deviates
were
also
psychopathic
personalities
but
all
aliens
who
were
sexual
deviates.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
we
don't
think
so
and
we
don't
think
that
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
thinks
so,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
quite
clear
we
think
from
the
reported
cases
and
from
all
the
cases
that
we
know
of
that
immigration
services
acted
upon
that
that
they
don't
consider
one
or
any
sporadic
acts
of
homosexuality's
being
sufficient
to
bring
a
particular
alien
within
the
class.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
--
in
an
appendix
to
its
reported
decision
in
matter
of
p
in
7
i&n
decisions
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
quite
clearly
noted
that
the
fact
that
an
individual
performs
a
homosexual
act
does
not
immediately
classify
him
as
a
homosexual.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
is
based
upon
--
yes,
he
was.
there
was.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
was
--
yes,
sir.
there's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
there's
a
public
health
service
finding
on
the
basis
of
the
public
health
service
psychiatrist
and
doctors
examining
the
statements
of
the
petitioner.
and
very
specifically,
on
page
11
of
the
record,
that
that
certification
appears
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
contained
in
the
statement
which
is
petitioner's
own
statement
of
--
his
own
history,
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
alien
was
afflicted
with
a
class
a
condition
namely,
psychopathic
personality,
sexual
deviate
at
the
time
of
his
admission
to
the
united
states.
so
that
the
standards
that
the
immigration
service
is
applying
is
not
the
one
that
switch
across
the
board
to
anybody
who
is
committed
a
single
or
very
sporadic
homosexual
acts
in
his
lifetime
but
to
one
who,
as
this
petitioner
did,
engaged
in
as
a
--
as
a
regular
practice.
and
indeed,
we
think
that
the
evidence,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
noted
in
petitioner's
argument,
it
wasn't
even
contested
as
to
whether
he
really
was
a
“homosexual”
to
the
extent
that
that
word
has
meaning
to
the
extent
that
congress,
we
submit,
wanted
it
to
have
meaning
that
he
was
a
homosexual
at
the
time
of
entry.
indeed,
he
admitted
as
much.
he
said
as
much
in
his
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
far
more
of
the
former,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there's
no
argument
about
those
facts
but
there's
also
no
argument
that
he
himself
said
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
selective
service
board
that
he
was
homosexual
and
that
he
received
a
correct
classification
on
that
basis,
so
that
the
petitioner
himself
is
not
attempting
in
anyway
to
challenge
that
kind
of
a
finding.
true,
it
may
to
be
sure,
we
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
the
very
word
“homosexual”
has
vague
--
certain
vague
meanings
as
it
paraphrased.
all
that
we
argue
is
that
congress
made
it
clear
that
that
to
the
extent
that
that
word
does
have
meaning,
it
wished
to
have
aliens
who
were
--
who
didn't
meet
that
condition
excluded
from
entry
into
the
united
states.
going
--
now,
if
i
may
to
the
constitutional
issue,
which
is
whether
section
212
(a)
(4)
is
unconstitutionally
vague
as
applied
to
this
situation
because
the
words
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
are
too
indefinite
to
provide
a
warning
to
aliens
or
a
guide
to
administrators
in
courts.
we
submit
that
there's
no
constitutional
defect
to
this
language.
first,
because
warning
in
the
sense
that
it's
usually
thought
of
in
the
constitutional
sense
which
is
necessary
for
criminal
and
certain
kinds
of
civil
statute
is
irrelevant
to
the
kind
of
determination
that
has
to
be
made
here.
and
second,
because
we
think
that
the
legislative
histories
provide
sufficient
content
to
the
word
“psychopathic
personality”,
to
ensure
a
fair
and
even-handed
administration
by
those
who
were
responsible
for
administering
the
act
and
by
the
courts.
i
say
warning
is
irrelevant
because
the
statute
does
not
on
its
face
or
in
the
manner
of
its
administration
purport
to
regulate
how
an
alien
is
to
act
after
he
enters
the
united
states.
all
that
it
does
is
that
it
excludes
aliens,
who
fit
certain
statutory
descriptions
at
the
time
that
they
seek
to
enter.
the
question
before
the
immigration
officer
and
the
boards
of
appeal
and
the
courts
was
whether
petitioner
was
“homosexual”
at
the
time
he
entered
the
united
states
in
1955.
now
with
all
the
warning
in
the
world,
assuming
that
that
statute
have
been
as
clear
as
it
could
have
been,
petitioner
could
not
have
changed
that
statute.
now,
of
course
its
true,
petitioner
might
as
judge
moore
pointed
out
in
a
dissenting
opinion
below,
have
acted
differently
after
his
arrival
in
the
united
states
and
thereby
not
provided
evidence
which
would
corroborate
the
conclusion
that
that
would
have
been
arrived
at
in
any
event
from
his
own
history
of
his
conduct
before
he
entered
the
united
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
as
a
practical
fact,
of
course,
mr.
justice
brennan
the
only
way
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh!
it
did.
it
definitely
did
have
considerable
relevance.
but
we
think
that
the
notion
of
fair
warning
has
never
been
thought
to
apply
to
evidence
as
it
were.
it's
--
people
subject
to
a
statute
are
entitled
to
be
warned
as
to
whether
they
conduct
they
engaged
in
is
lawful
or
is
not
lawful.
not
to
whether
the
conduct
they
engaged
and
may,
in
some
way,
provide
evidence
of
unlawful
activity
or
something
that
may
redound
to
their
detriment.
assume
for
example,
a
man
prepares
to
commit
a
crime
before
or
prepares
to
commit
certain
acts
which
were
made
criminal
after
he
begins
his
preparations.
i
think
there'd
be
no
question
but
that
the
beginning
acts
of
preparation
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
even
though
at
the
time
that
he
did
them
he
had
no
reason
to
know
that
the
conduct
he
ultimately
performed
was
criminal.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
warning.
you're
not
entitled
to
warning
in
order
to
conceal
from
government
official's
evidence,
conduct
which
may
in
some
way
show
that
either
you're
guilty
of
an
offense
or
that
something
would
result
that
would
be
to
your
detriment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
i
could
qualify
that,
i
think
it
would
be
right.
we're
not
making
that
argument
but
we
also
--
we
also
--
we
don't
necessarily
believe
that
it's
wrong.
we
say
it's
a
matter
of
dispute
among
psychiatrist.
in
other
words,
congress
did
not,
we
think
fly
in
the
face
of
psychiatric
testimony
when
it
said,
“this
is
conduct
which
could
be
classified
under
afflicted
with
a
psychopathic
personality”.
indeed,
some
of
the
responses
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
homosexual
were
formerly.
we
think
indicate
that
those
who
responded
believe
that
that
may
be
it
could
be
characterized.
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
we
did
in
our
brief
i
think
is
that
we
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
any
absolute
medical
knowledge
which
would
today
make
it
entirely
clear
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
psychopathic
personality.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
intended
to
say
that
congress
was
acting
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
try
to
be.
we're
not
--
in
other
words,
all
that
i'm
saying
is
--
or
all
that
we're
trying
to
say
here
is
that
congress
had
before
it
or
could
have
had
before
it
various
psychiatric
opinions.
it
apparently
chose
one
and
that's
perfectly
within
the
domain
of
the
legislature.
if
today
it
turns
out
that
that's
wrong
or
if
the
weight
the
psychiatric
opinion
to
the
contrary,
that
is
not
we
think
invalidate
the
statute
or
make
it
totally
inapplicable.
we
just
think
its
congress'
choices
among
expert
opinion
as
to
which
view
it
wants
to
pay.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
would
not
be
making
that
argument.
but
we
think
that
in
effect,
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
is
certainly
to
be
construed
--
it's
certainly
to
be
applied
no
less
and
that
the
statute
has
itself
said
of
aliens
afflicted
with
homosexuality.
now,
i
understand
petitioner's
counsel
to
be
arguing,
that
is
a
totally
inappropriate
characterization
in
any
event
because
homosexuality
could
not
be
a
condition.
we
submit
if
the
legislature
had
that
congress
had
so
stated,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
--
we
think
the
administrators
and
the
courts
to
get
content
to
the
extent
that
it's
possible
to
that
policy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
psychopathic.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
legislative
history
certainly
isn't
explicit
on
that.
i
can
only
guess
and
one
--
one
guess
certainly
could
be
precisely
what
we
were
discussing
here.
which
is
that
by
that
time
statute
was
amended,
congress
may
or
those
who
suggested
the
amendment
may
reasonably
if
had
some
doubt
as
to
whether
scientifically,
homosexuality
or
sexual
deviation
could
be
considered
a
form
of
psychopathic
personality.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think,
sir.
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
announces
or
i
think
congress
has
said
disjunctive,
“if
you
now
proceed
against
the
man
who
is
homosexual,
you
should
know
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
but
we
think
that
the
quotations
from
the
senate
report
which
accompany
that,
which
appear
in
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief,
we
think
do
make
it
clear
that
congress
was
not
intending
by
that
in
anyway
to
indicate
that
they
meant
anything
less
one
when
a
person
in
active
statute
in
52.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
it
refers
to
a
condition.
but
i
don't
think
it
can
be
afflicted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it
does
say
“afflicted”
and
i
think
afflicted
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
as
one
can
hardly
be
afflicted
with
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
what
he
has
done
in
the
past.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
and
to
that
extent,
it's
also
similar
to
what
the
initial
draft
of
the
1952
legislation
were
saying
that
because
that
covers
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts,
and
presumably
congress
says
somebody
other
than
homosexuals
when
specified
the
latter.
let
me
just
note
in
addition
a
point
which
the
--
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
during
the
petitioner's
argument,
which
is
that
so
far
as
the
fair
warning
point
is
concerned,
it's
quite
bizarre
to
think
of
fair
warning
in
the
context
of
conduct
which
is
unlawful
under
the
laws
of
50
states
and
it
was
unlawful
under
the
law
of
new
york
at
the
time
that
petitioner
engaged
in.
it's
hardly
likely
that
if
the
statute
had
been
far
more
explicit
in
stating
that
deportation
would
follow
a
showing
of
homosexuality
at
the
time
of
entry
in
the
united
states,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
be
anymore
deterred
from
this
kind
of
conduct
and
by
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
criminal
statutes
on
the
books.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
that
to
that
extent,
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
suggestion
in
the
--
a
void
for
vagueness
argument
that
somebody
in
petitioner's
position
has
a
right
to
rely
on
what
he
knows
at
the
time
he
enters
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
flies
on
the
face
of
many,
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
held,
affirmed,
and
reaffirmed
the
proposition
that
congress
may
retrospectively
legislate
with
regard
to
the
deportation
of
aliens
in
the
united
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
think
congress
should
be
but
we
think
that
--
to
that
extent,
we
think
the
gap
can
be
filled
by
legislative
history
because
it's
true.
as
so
far
as
the
petitioner
as
an
individual
is
concerned,
he
can't
be
expected
to
go
beyond
the
words
of
the
statute
if
he
can't
even
be
expected
to
read
the
statute
at
all.
what
we
think
that
the
administrators
have
available
legislative
history.
and
there's
no
suggestion
here,
that
the
administrators
have
gone
beyond
the
homosexuals
and
sex
perverts
which
congress
by
its
legislative
history
indicated
it
wanted
to
cover
by
this
language.
in
other
words,
if
these
were
a
case,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we're
--
if
we
were
on
the
boarder
line
of
something
which
congress
may
or
may
not
have
wanted,
then
we
think
that
the
decisions
which
say
that
a
statute
has
to
be
precise
and
specific
in
order
to
ensure
that
it
be
given
a
fair
and
even
handed
administration
would
apply.
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
words
in
the
statute
are
general
but
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
there
is
a
very
core
of
conditions
that
that
were
intended
to
be
covered
and
the
administrators
in
this
case
are
acting
within
that
core
of
conditions
intended
to
be
covered.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
excluded
from
initial
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
were
none
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
entry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
since
they've
added
sexual
deviation.
they
specifically
ask
whether
the
applicant
is
a
sexual
deviant.
they
don't
specifically
refer
to
homosexuality
even
now.
they
just
say
sexual
deviant.
let
me
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know.
mr.
nathan
lewin
you
mean
un
--
yes.
all
you
think
--
under
the
psychopathic
personality
already?
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
really
couldn't
give
you
an
answer
to
that
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it's
a
broad
and
definable
class.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
they
may
have
been
the
only
ones
who
were
in
fact
excluded
but
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
or
deported.
let
me
point
out
one
fact
which
is
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
1952
act,
as
far
back
in
1917
immigration
act.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
statute
applying
to
con
--
persons
of
constitutional
psychopathic
inferiority.
now,
that
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
homosexuals
or
sexual
deviants
in
anyway
and
it
didn't
cover
that.
and
that
the
senate
report,
which
accompanied
the
original
draft
of
the
‘52
legislation,
pointed
that
out.
i've
just
been
referred
to
the
manual
for
medical
examination
of
aliens
which
the
public
health
service
has
and
they
do
define
psychopathic
personality
as
covering
any
personality
disorder
and
then
have
a
definition,
to
put
a
long
sentence
which
covers
certainly
more
than
sexual
deviates.
it
says,
these
disorders
are
characterized
by
developmental
defect
or
pathological
trends
in
the
personality
structure
with
minimal
subjective
anxiety
and
little
or
no
distress
and
so
on.
so
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
minimal
subjective
anxiety
and
little
or
no
distress.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
all
--
that's
all
of
course
qualified
by
the
introductory
clause
which
says
developmental
defects
or
pathological
trends
in
personality.
i
don't
know
how
you
show
a
pathological
trend
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
can't
say
but
i
will
supply
an
answer
and
i
will
find
that
out,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
will
set
up
an
answer
on
it.
if
i
might
just
return
for
a
minute
to
the
--
again
to
the
question
of
fair
warning
and
i
say
this
court
has
said
as
recently
in
the
1956
term
in
the
lehman
and
carson
case
and
mulcahey
and
catalanotte
in
353
u.s.
with
only
two
dissents
that
congress
may
legislate
retrospectively
with
regards
to
deportation
of
aliens
who
are
in
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
an
alien
in
the
united
states
who
enters
has
in
effect
a
revocable
license
here.
congress
may
but
act
reasonably
legislate
retrospectively
to
provide
first
deportation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
we
don't
read
that.
we
don't
read
the
65
statute
as
being
retrospective.
but
we're
just
saying,
this
is
an
answer
to
the
argument
which
petitioner
makes
and
which
mr.
justice
fortas
raised,
which
is,
that
this
man
relied
on
the
absence
of
any
clear
exclusionary
provision
in
the
statute.
we
think
he
has
no
constitutional
right
to
rely
on
that.
that
if
he
entered
the
united
states
and
did
not
know
of
this
but
later
it
was
point
out
to
him
that
by
reason
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
construction
and
application
of
the
statute
homosexuality
was
a
ground
for
excludability,
then,
he
could
be
excluded.
although,
he
thought
at
the
time
he
entered
and
at
the
time
he
committed
his
homosexual
acts
even
in
the
united
states
that
it
was
not
a
ground
for
deportation.
indeed
in
those
cases,
in
galvan
and
press
and
harisiades
v.
shaughnessy,
the
court
sustained
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
be
deported.
either
at
the
time
they
entered
the
united
states
or
at
the
time
they
committed
acts,
which
under
a
subsequent
statute
became
the
basis
for
their
deportation.
and
we
think
that
applies
in
these
circumstances
as
well.
