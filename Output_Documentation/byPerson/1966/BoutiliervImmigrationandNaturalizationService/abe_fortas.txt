justice
abe
fortas
but
why
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
relinquishing
the
possibility
that
we
might
decide
this
just
on
the
basis
of
an
incorrect
construction
and
application
of
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
it's
possible
that
this
case
could
be
decided
without
reaching
a
constitutional
issue
here?
justice
abe
fortas
because
it's
not
your
argument,
is
it,
that
the
phrase
“psychopathic
personality”
is
a
phrase
that
is
so
at
large
that
there's
--
there
has
no
medical
--
no
discernible
medical
meaning?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
your
argument
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
let
us
say
that
it
has
a
reasonably
definite
meaning
and
that
the
service
in
the
court
below
went
contrary
to
that
reasonably
as
attainable
and
that
with
meaning
in
this
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
that
were
--
but
if
it
that
were
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
itself
gave
a
particular
meaning
to
that
word,
to
those
words,
then
i
suppose
you
would
reach
the
constitutional
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
there
really
any
issue
about
that.
is
there
any
issue
as
to
that
that
is
--
as
i
read
the
record,
i
don't
--
i
gather
there
is
no
dispute
that
this
man
was
homosexual
prior
to
entry?
when
is
that
issue
was
not
made,
i
don't
want
to
assert
that
it
was
or
was
not.
but
there's
no
issue
presented
at
the
time
of
this
litigation
as
to
whether
he
was
or
was
not
a
homosexual
at
the
time
of
the
initial
entry
into
this
country,
'51
was
it
or
'52?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
first
one?
justice
abe
fortas
‘55.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
medical
evidence,
i'm
talking
about
the
legal
issue,
is
that
the
legal
issue
presented?
was
there
any
contest
as
to
whether
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
was
no
issue
tendered?
justice
abe
fortas
does
he
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
makes
you
say
that
so
clear
on
the
legislative
history?
justice
abe
fortas
i
read
your
brief
on
some
care
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
do
is
to
--
in
substance,
to
rely
upon
the
report
that
was
submitted
by
the
public
health
service
in
which
is
extracted
on
pages
23
and
following
of
your
brief.
and
as
i
read
that,
it's
certainly
is
arguable
that
what
the
service
said
was
that
ordinarily
or
frequently,
people
who
engage
in
sexual
deviation
are
psychopathic
personalities.
and
i
--
i
really
had
a
little
trouble
finding
in
unequivocal
statement
in
that
report,
if
that's
what
you're
--
if
i'm
--
and
that
is
significant
if
i
am
correct
and
it
may
not
be
that
your
reliance
is
ultimately
on
that
report.
now,
i'm
excluding
subsequent
legislative
history.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
are
two
possibilities.
there
are
two
possible
inferences
from
that
--
arguably
anyway.
one,
is
that
congress
wanted
to
include
all
sexual
deviate
--
all
persons
who
had
engage
in
sexual
deviation
or
that
they
wanted
to
include
persons,
who
had
engaged
in
sexual
deviation,
and
--
and,
who
where
psychopathic
personalities.
that
there
are
those
two
possible
inferences,
i
suggest
for
purposes
of
your
discussion.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
that
that
problem
you
said
is
as
clear
as
mud
to
me.
i
also
call
your
attention
top
of
page
24
where
it
says
that,
“the
latter
or
sociopathic”,
this
is
from
your
own
brief.
“the
latter
or
sociopathic
reactions
are
frequent
symptomatic
of
a
severe
underlying
neurosis
or
psychosis
and
frequently
include
those
groups
of
individual
suffering
from
addiction
or
sexual
deviation.”
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
persons
suffering,
you
remember
your
rules
of
logic?
because
i'm
sure
you
do,
that
person
suffering
from
addiction
or
sexual
deviation
are
always
included
in
the
group.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
explained
to
you
that
that
is
arguable.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
also
possible
to
read
this
to
mean
something
that
i
take
it
from
the
briefs
here
as
more
consonant
with
medical
science.
which
is
that
some
persons
engaged
in
homosexual
activities
may
be
in
the
category
of
psychopathic
personalities,
some
may
not.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
your
--
that
seems
to
be
the
medical
authority.
and
in
order
to
offset
that,
i
take
that
your
adversary's
position
is
that
it's
got
to
be
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
to
use
the
phrase
“psychopathic
personality”
in
a
sense
that
is
to
this
extent
artificial.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
think
sexual
deviates
and
persons
who
have
engaged
in
homosexual
acts
are
synonymous?
justice
abe
fortas
but
was
there
a
finding
in
this
case
that
this
man
is
a
sexual
deviate?
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
such
finding.
justice
abe
fortas
so
many
words.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin,
let
me
be
clear
about
one
thing.
i
take
it
that
the
government
does
not
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
so
to
speak
of
medical
dictionary
definition,
the
term
“psychopathic
personality”
includes
the
phenomenon
which
is
involved
here.
you
do
not
make
that
argument,
do
you?
you
make
the
argument
on
the
contrary
that
congress
intended
to
use
that
phrase
in
a
way
that
is,
shall
i
say,
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
the
dictionary
definition.
now,
am
i
wrong
--
right
or
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
make
--
you
don't
make
that
point
in
your
brief,
did
you?
i
don't
remember.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
sure
you're
sufficiently
cautious
in
that
last
pages?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it
might
not
have
tried
then
if
the
united
states
would
know
and
actually
know.
justice
abe
fortas
it
can
infer
that
canadian
would
know
the
laws
of
the
new
york
state.
i
believe
it's
chargeable
with
that.
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
law
of
that.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
other
aspect
of
vagueness
here
is
that
made
a
good
idea
for
congress
to
be
quite
specific
and
when
it
tells
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
do
you
think
so?
justice
abe
fortas
why
that's
what
you
are?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
relinquishing

that
