justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
right
it
made
the
congress
--
congress
since
have
it
expressly
the
words
“sexual
deviation”
on
the
statute
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
both
psychopathic
personality
and
sexual
deviation
in
the
statute
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
report
said
that
was
done
only
to
make
clear
that
that's
what
they
meant
by
psychopathic
personality
in
the
first
place?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
say
including
sexual
deviation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
said,
“psychopathic
personality
or
sexual
abuse”.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
that
--
there's
no
reason
i
suppose
that
the
criminal
laws
there
any
--
any
lesser
deterrent
is
there
than
the
threat
of
a
deportation?
i
mean,
if
you're
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
from
this
proceeding
would
never
have
been
brought
or
rather
would
have
been
brought
as
it's
never
been
in
the
evidence
of
post-entry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
had
--
had
some
considerable
relevance
to
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
to
say
that
that
congress
had
said
in
psychopathic
personality
that
aliens
afflicted
with
dandruff,
a
legislative
history
show
they
must
to
include
homosexual
as
among
those
inflicted
with
dandruff.
you
wouldn't
be
making
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
change
in
the
statute
approved?
it
didn't
say
psychopathic
personality
including
homosexuality
but
--
or
including
sexual
deviations.
it
says
homo
--
homo
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
psychopathic
person
or
--
and/or
sexual
deviate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
change?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
you
think
it
may
now
be
that
all
over
--
original
psychopathic
personality
has
been
retained.
if
congress
did
not
buy
that,
those
words
now
include
homosexuality.
that
those
who
are
included
are
only
in
sexual
deviation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
now
narrowed
--
if
that
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now,
it
means
that
psychopathic
personality
be
read
more
narrowly
than
in
initial
virtue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
mr.
lewin,
is
this
--
this
is
only
the
court
have
ordered
that
this
apply
on
--
the
most
excluded,
seriously
--
excluded
from
admission
in
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
only
question
to
ask
an
applicant
like
this
which
might
elicit
in
response.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
are
that
now,
since
they've
added
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see,
is
this
an
argument
that
in
any

under

65
