is
there
any
difference
in
the
history
of
the
proceedings
in
florida
and
in
georgia
with
reference
to
the

being
the

justice

what
had
happened
before
--
justice

just
particularly
apportionment?
justice

yes.
and
in

justice

had
the
court
previously
not
issued
an
order
that
they
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
long
did
they
delay
the
court
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
times
did
they
come
up
with
a
plan
that
wasn't
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
what,
haven't
felt
what?
justice
hugo

black
were
there
any
court
orders

that
had
to
be
issued.
justice
hugo
l.

was
it
decided?
justice
hugo

black
but
do
you
mean
by
certain
attitude
that
you
approve
what
it's
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
our
problem
is
not
whether
they
understand
or
whether
it
complied
with
the
standards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
you
are
arguing,
