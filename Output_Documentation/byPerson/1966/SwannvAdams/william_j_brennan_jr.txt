justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
they
were
the
litigant
--
the
original
plaintiffs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
--
he
moved
his
standing
even
though
this
litigation
is
complete?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
started
the
lawsuit,
he's
not
yet
happy
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
result
below
and
he
keep
pressing
to
something
better
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
he
now
suggests
he
moves
his
standing
because
his
county
of
equal
is
in
good
faith.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
if
i
could
translate
that
in
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
figured
(inaudible)
is
that
--
was
it
87,595
of
the
small
represented
by
how
many
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
114,053
also
by
one
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
aren't
they
multiple
members
in
its
area
of
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
per
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
from
34,584
to
48,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
no
hearing
i
gather
evidence
taken
on
the
justification
that
you
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
it
exists.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
our
cases
would
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
suppose
our
cases
require
that
these
other
--
i
don't
recall
the
records
frankly,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
other
case
is
wyoming
and
virginia
versus
(inaudible)
but
it
may
well
be
that
there
were
records
made
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
justifications
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
departures.
do
you
know
where
they
were
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
those
other
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
know
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
just
wondered
if
--
i
forgot,
it
was
--
was
it
wrong
in
sincock?
one
of
them,
didn't
we
indicate
if
they
were
to
be
departures
like
this,
perhaps
they'd
be
alright
but
that
there
had
to
be
justifications
established
by
proofs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
bring
me
up
a
date
on
the
time
table?
you've
just
elected
a
legislature,
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
april.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
two
years?
oh,
a
session
that
is
you
meet
every
two
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
explore
this
business,
that
they
--
that
there
had
to
be
a
theory
on
justification,
suppose
we
would've
concluded
it,
it
should've
been
and
that's
--
it
sort
of
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
that
picket.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
all
be
completed
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
next
election
is
not
now
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
in
this
inference
in
the
georgia
case
in
order
of
this
court
which
approved
the
plan
under
which
the
legislature
as
i
recall
it
was
elected
on
november
8,
in
the
georgia
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
approved
it
for
the
purposes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
such
order
of
this
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
indicates,
there
is
only
of
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
didn't
state
an
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
didn't
state
that
order,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
there
a
possibility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
of
your
case?
oh,
well,
we
asked
before
to
stay
that
election
after
that
or
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
is
in
the
record
or
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
well,
did
you
say
that
there's
something
in
burns
and
richardson
on
the
necessity
for
a
hearing
on
justification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
talk
--
i
should
remember
it
i
suppose
but
i
don't,
are
they
talking
about
multi
member
districts
then
or
