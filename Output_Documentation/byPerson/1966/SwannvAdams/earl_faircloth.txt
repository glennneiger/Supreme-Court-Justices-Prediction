mr.
earl
faircloth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
times
passed
when
i
have
not
agreed
that
the
product
of
the
florida
legislature
was
a
good
faith
attempt
to
meet
the
guidelines
laid
down
by
this
court
i
have
said
so.
on
this
occasion,
as
we
come
before
the
court
once
again,
it
is
my
position
that
this
product
of
the
florida
legislature
which
is
now
before
the
court
does
represent
a
bona
fide
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
this
legislature
to
construct
a
rational
plan
of
apportionment
based
upon
population
as
the
point
of
departure.
and
in
my
reply
here
to
my
brother
mr.
paul
and
i
should
like
to
touch
upon
these
points.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
contend
that
his
standing
here
as
an
appellant
is
not
in
best
posture.
secondly
that
this
plan
is
within
the
guidelines
which
the
legislature
of
florida
understood
and
it
was
a
reasonable
understanding
i
think
of
what
the
guidelines
were.
thirdly,
that
there
is
no
pattern
of
invidious
discrimination
in
this
plan
which
is
now
before
the
court
and
finally
as
i
said
this
is
a
representive
--
representative
of
the
good
faith
of
this
legislature
in
adopting
a
population
based
reapportionment
plan.
now,
as
to
the
appellants
mr.
swann
or
judge
swann
as
he
is
now
and
dade
county,
the
most
populous
county
in
florida
which
i
too,
i'm
a
resident
and
citizen.
in
this
plan,
dade
county
and
the
house
of
representative
has
an
almost
perfect
break
on
the
mean
legislative
house
district.
i
believe
they're
underrepresented
by
about
0.43
in
their
house
of
representative
districts.
they
are
underrepresented
by
5%
plus
in
the
senate
and
so
i
say
that
so
far
as
the
litigants
here,
the
appellants
are
complaining,
their
complains
are
de
minimus
departures
from
the
mean
average
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate.
and
that
they're
standing
to
complain
is
not
in
its
good
posture
as
it
has
been
in
other
trips
to
this
court
on
which
occasions
i
was
trying
to
agree
with
them.
now,
secondly
within
the
guidelines
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
i
feel
that
they
--
they
are
not
hurt
by
their
own
admission
before
the
lower
court,
the
attorney
for
dade
county
admitted
that
he
couldn't
complain
about
the
formulas
so
far
as
dade
county
was
concerned.
and
of
course,
the
appellant
swann
is
also
a
citizen
and
resident
of
dade
county
and
so
far
as
his
complain
is
concerned
stands
in
the
same
posture.
mr.
earl
faircloth
mr.
swann
was,
yes
sir.
and
dade
county
was
original
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
i
feel
that
he
personally
as
a
citizen
of
dade
county
his
vote
is
not
discriminated
against
by
--
he
is
given
an
equal
way
in
his
county
and
that
what
he
was
seeking
to
begin
with.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
we've
set
his
finding
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
that's
right.
he
had
a
lot
to
complain
about
when
he
started
with
this
county
but
i
say
that
he
now
has
the
very
minimum
departures
on
the
average.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
suppose
they
are
carried
to
that
extreme,
it
would
be
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
there
were
several
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
allowed
amicus
briefs
but
refused
to
allow
the
parties
to
intervene.
so,
on
that
point
i
think
it
is
true
that
many
interveners
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
come
in.
but
may
i
address
myself
to
the
merits
of
the
plan
which
is
before
the
court.
first
of
all,
in
summary
this
plan
has
48
senators
and
117
representatives.
the
maximum
population
variance
ratio
is
1.3
in
our
senate.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor
that
is
the
percentage
difference
between
the
largest
district
and
the
smallest
district.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
believe
that
would
be
correct,
1.3%
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
the
largest
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right,
the
largest
district
is
1.3%
larger
than
the
smallest
district.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
would
be
one
senator.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
by
one
senator,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
we
merely
use
the
population
variant.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
there
are
many
district,
many
multiple
member
districts
in
our
senate
as
well
as
in
the
house
of
representatives.
so,
in
the
house
of
representatives
then
the
maximum
population
variants
ratio
is
1.41%
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
the
legislature
here
and
if
i
may
say
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
rational
plan,
they
started
out
to
apportion
on
the
basis
of
the
congressional
districts.
we
have
12
congressional
districts
in
florida
and
there
is
where
we
get
48
senators.
it
was
thought
to
make
four
senators
from
each
congressional
district
and
of
course
when
they
get
down
with
members
of
the
legislature
to
hammer
out
of
plan
with
the
practicality
is
being
what
they
are.
there
were
--
it
was
impossible
to
subdistrict
all
of
them.
for
example
in
the
most
rural
of
our
congressional
districts
and
we
have
24
rural
counties
and
the
four
senators
ran
at
large
in
all
24
of
these
counties.
i
have
a
feeling
that
in
the
next
session
that
will
be
subdistricted
but
it
will
be
subject
--
subdistricted
that
i
feel
certain
on
the
basis
of
population
as
nearly
as
they
can
come
to
it.
the
part
of
the
rationality
of
the
legislature
was
to
preserve
county
lines
as
much
as
they
could,
but
at
the
same
time
to
base
it
upon
population.
and
so
in
summary
on
the
guidelines,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
of
course
i
agree
with
the
court's
position
in
not
making
a
rigid
mathematical
formula
out
of
it.
i
think
that
would
be
extremely
unworkable.
mathematics
of
valuable
only
so
far
as
i
can
see
for
comparison
purposes
to
plans
that
have
been
found
to
be
valid
and
free
of
invidious
discrimination
and
if
i
could
refer
to
at
least
three
cases
which
i
believe
has
been
before
this
court
in
the
last
months
or
within
the
last
year.
in
the
state
of
colorado
a
plan
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
ration
in
one
house
was
1.46%
and
in
the
other
house
was
1.73%.
in
virginia,
the
population
variants
ratio
in
one
house
was
1.37%
and
in
the
other
1.53%
and
in
wyoming
a
plan
approved
or
affirmed
by
this
court
the
variants
ratio
in
one
house
was
2.08%
and
in
the
other
2.59%
compared
to
florida
with
1.3%
in
the
senate
and
1.41%
in
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
earl
faircloth
all
i
saw
your
honor
was
that
it
came
before
this
court
it
was
affirmed
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
i
did
note
that
florida
in
the
relationship
of
a
number
of
people
or
percentage
of
people
that
takes
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
legislature
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
florida
i
believe
it's
50%
almost
exactly
can
elect
50%
of
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
on
each
individual
theories,
there
would
be
an
explanation.
i
could
take
the
time
of
the
court
in
some
instances
and
i'm
sure
give
a
political
reason
for
it.
why
this
senator
and
this
representative
and
whether
this
group
of
senators
couldn't
agree
on
any
thing
less
than
that.
my
thought
is
that
they
are
now
convinced
and
trying
to
work
toward
an
apportionment
plan
which
is
following
a
rational
basis
and
its
population
based.
i
recommended
to
them
as
my
brother
mr.
paul
pointed
out
that
a
variance
of
more
than
15%
would
be
hard
to
sustain.
i
don't
think
that
should
be
a
rigid
group
because
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
earl
faircloth
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
they
were
in
--
there
was
no
testimony
taken,
no
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no.
i
can't
say
that.
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
faircloth
my
impression
has
been
that
in
a
texas
case
some
briefs
were
filed
and
tables
were
filed
in
this
--
and
--
but
and
i
believe
there
might
have
been
some
testimony
taken
in
the
texas
case.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
that
and
perhaps
i
should
be
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
i
wouldn't
quarrel
with
that
being
a
very
good
idea
though
because
i
think
perfectly,
fine
explanations
could
be
made
about
the
departures
here.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor,
i
will
concede
that
if
it
was
absolutely
no
departure
beyond
15%
that
it
could
be
--still
be
discriminatory.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
will
concede
mr.
justice
white
that
the
brief
contains
a
lot
of
typos
and
population
ratios
and
so
on
and
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
the
court
indicated
that
there
must
proofs
submitted
as
the
justification
from
the
variance
of
an
exact
percentage
population.
well,
then
i'm
sure
that
we
could
comply
but
we
haven't
been
laboring
under
the
apprehension
that
that
is
what
was
required
of
us.
if
it
is,
we
can,
the
15%
rule
of
course
was
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
i'm
afraid
you're
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
exactly
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
exactly
right
and
i
think
that
the
only
value
of
a
15%
rule
or
10%
rule
would
be
to
allow
some
area
for
that
kind
of
maneuvering
in
this
political
picket
as
it
has
been
called.
and
so
i
think
statistically
which
is
what
we
largely
based
it
upon,
the
departures,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
discernable
or
palpable
pattern
here
of
bad
faith
and
an
attempt
to
discriminate
against
anybody.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
convenes
in
april.
mr.
earl
faircloth
for
its
biennial
session,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
your
honor
it
would
be
a
very
extremely
bad
situation
and
really
hard
for
us
to
do.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir,
its
two
years
from
now.
i
might
point
out
and
depends
in
the
florida
legislature
that
--
and
our
governor
that
within
hours
after
this
court's
reversal
and
remand
of
the
previous
case,
the
governor
had
called
the
legislature
into
special
session
and
required
them
to
consider
a
reapportionment
plan
recommended
that
they
consider
it
on
the
congressional
district
lines
in
time
for
the
primary
elections
which
were
then
in
progress
and
the
time
for
qualifying
was
set
back
somewhat
so
that
the
new
plan,
this
plan
could
be
put
into
effect
in
time
for
the
spring
primary
elections.
that
was
all
done
under
this
plan
and
then
in
november
8th,
this
legislature
was
elected
under
this
plan
and
will
meet
in
april
of
this
year
for
its
biennial
session.
so,
we
have
complied
before
the
election
but
i
don't
know
about
the
difficulties
of
complying
before
the
session
meets
in
april.
i
might
submit
your
honor
that
we
might
ask
the
same
indulgence
that
the
court
has
given
to
our
sister
state
of
georgia,
a
plan
which
was
demonstrably
unconstitutional
and
conceded
to
be.
i
believe
the
georgia
ratio
there
was
1.81%
in
one
house
and
2.005
in
the
other.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
it
approved
it
until
a
certain
time
in
the
future.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
and
when
the
district
courts
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
sir?
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i'm
not
sure,
are
you
speaking
of
the
georgia
case
mr.
justice?
mr.
earl
faircloth
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
earl
faircloth
my
brother
paul
has
asked
a
lot,
he
might
--
he
may
have.
mr.
justice
white,
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right,
it's
approved
by
the
lower
court
as
a
permanent
plan,
acceptable
in
all
respects.
so,
my
thought
is
that
if
it
should
be
found
not
to
be
then
accord
us
the
same
considerations
as
georgia.
tell
us
what's
wrong
with
it
and
let
us
meet
with
this
legislature
that
has
been
elected
and
i
feel
certain
that
this
legislature
will
in
good
faith
apply
with
whatever
the
rule
is
or
whatever
they
understand
the
rule
to
be.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
in
georgia?
mr.
earl
faircloth
in
georgia?
mr.
earl
faircloth
oh,
before
this
one,
there
had
been
as
my
brother
paul
pointed
out
many
times
the
legislature
has
considered
the
question
and
have
not
come
up
with
the
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
they've
always
come
up
with
a
plan
and
they
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
this
court
has
now
said
they
were
all
no
good
except
this
one
and
i'm
hoping
that
this
court
will
say
the
plan
now
is
good.
i
haven't
felt
that
the
others
were
but
i
do
feel
that
this
one
is.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
haven't
felt
to
the
others
met
the
standards
of
the
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
other
cases
but
i
do
feel
that
this
one
does.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
after
baker
versus
carr
in
1962
they
immediately
--
mr.
swann's
case
was
then
pending.
the
legislature
met
and
approved
something
that
was
rejected
by
the
people
in
november
of
1962.
now,
the
governor
called
the
legislature
back
into
session
immediately
after
the
general
election
in
november
of
‘62
and
they
met
for
30
days
and
couldn't
agree
on
anything.
then,
on
march
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
the
district
court
had
ordered
that
it
be
done.
i
believe
between
the
general
election
rejection
of
the
plan
in
november
1962,
the
court
entered
an
order
saying
that
our
constitution
and
our
formula,
38
senators,
95
house
members
were
null
and
void
and
so
we
did
meet,
the
court
approved
a
plan,
adopted
in
january
of
1963
for
112
representatives
and
i
think
43
senators,
they
met
at
the
regular
biennial
session
in
1963
and
brought
forth
another
plan
which
was
appealed
and
which
this
court
held
didn't
meet
the
standard.
and
then
another
plan
in
response
to
that
was
submitted
which
i
didn't
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
georgia
still
hasn't
come
as
close
as
we
have
your
honor
and
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir,
very
too.
mr.
justice
black,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
georgia
we
have
a
plan
which
is
agreed
not
to
meet
the
standard
but
they
have
been
given
time
within
which
to
do
it
and
i
think
the
record
of
florida
legislature
at
this
time
on
this
performance
it
comes
in
my
opinion
so
close
and
it's
free
enough
of
invidious
discrimination
that
any
further
guidelines
will
be
promptly
acted
upon.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
believe
the
first
order
was
issued
some
time
in
july
of
1962.
florida
has
been
in
it
since
baker
versus
carr
and
before
and
at
that
time
was
approximately
the
bottom
of
the
list
in
the
relationship
of
the
population
to
representation
in
the
state.
i
make
no
defense
of
that
but
i
do
make
a
defense
of
the
present
attitude
of
the
legislature
and
its
acceptance
of
population
has
to
guide
and
submit
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
i
happen
to
agree
with
it
and
believe
that
there
is
a
sense
of
the
desire
to
comply
with
the
guidelines
as
they
understand
them
and
they
will.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
agree.
i
agree
exactly,
it
must
be
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
do.
i
haven't
agreed
in
the
past
but
i
do
with
this
plan.
mr.
earl
faircloth
what?
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
if
there
is
to
be
a
rule
chiseled
in
stone
as
to
percentage
then
if
we
knew
that
i
believe
the
legislature
would
comply.
if
there
is
to
be
a
flexibility
but
not
as
much
as
we
have
in
those
in
this
plan
tell
us
what
it
is
and
give
us
the
opportunity
to
meet
at
our
next
session
with
this
newly
elected
legislature
which
is
the
greatest
population
base
legislature
in
history
of
our
state
and
i
think
there
will
be
a
compliance.
i
don't
agree
of
course
with
my
friend
and
brother
mr.
paul
in
his
lopsided
view
of
the
urban
versus
rural
discrimination.
i
note
in
his
brief
on
page
22
i
think
it
is,
he
makes
a
statement
that
no
single
urban
county
is
overrepresented
in
both
houses
while
at
least
five
rural
counties
are.
i
would
submit
that
--
let's
take
three,
volusia
county
that's
where
the
daytona
beach
is,
not
exactly
a
rural
place
overrepresented
in
both
houses.
pinellas,
not
st.
petersburg,
not
exactly
a
rural
county,
overrepresented
in
both
houses
and
brevard
where
kate
kennedy
is
located
and
that
too
is
the
situation
and
that
is
taking
sarasota
county
where
the
culture
and
art
center
of
florida
not
exactly
a
rural
county,
it's
the
12th
largest
county
in
florida,
overrepresented
in
both
houses.
so,
three
out
of
12
of
the
urban
counties
overrepresented
in
both
houses
and
as
mr.
paul
says
five
rural
counties,
overrepresented
in
both
houses
there
are
67
counties
leaving
by
his
definition
there
55
of
them
rural
and
five
out
of
55
being
overrepresented
in
both
houses
as
compared
to
three
out
of
12
urban
counties
overrepresented
in
both
counties
i
think
is
a
good
record
on
the
ballots.
so,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
submit
that
this
plan
under
consideration
by
the
court
is
a
plan
which
is
rational,
it
lacks
invidious
discrimination,
it
does
not
gerrymander
and
lead
the
three
urban
counties
i've
just
mentioned
went
republic
in
the
last
election.
so,
it's
not
gerrymandered
for
political
advantage,
it
is
a
not
gerrymandered
for
racial
disadvantage
or
discrimination
in
any
way
and
comes
close
enough
to
the
mathematical
guidelines
that
we've
understood
that
i
submit
it
is
a
plan
that
meets
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir,
they
are
urban.
they're
urban
counties
your
honor.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
times
passed
when
i
have
not
agreed
that
the
product
of
the
florida
legislature
was
a
good
faith
attempt
to
meet
the
guidelines
laid
down
by
this
court
i
have
said
so.
on
this
occasion,
as
we
come
before
the
court
once
again,
it
is
my
position
that
this
product
of
the
florida
legislature
which
is
now
before
the
court
does
represent
a
bona
fide
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
this
legislature
to
construct
a
rational
plan
of
apportionment
based
upon
population
as
the
point
of
departure.
and
in
my
reply
here
to
my
brother
mr.
paul
and
i
should
like
to
touch
upon
these
points.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
contend
that
his
standing
here
as
an
appellant
is
not
in
best
posture.
secondly
that
this
plan
is
within
the
guidelines
which
the
legislature
of
florida
understood
and
it
was
a
reasonable
understanding
i
think
of
what
the
guidelines
were.
thirdly,
that
there
is
no
pattern
of
invidious
discrimination
in
this
plan
which
is
now
before
the
court
and
finally
as
i
said
this
is
a
representive
--
representative
of
the
good
faith
of
this
legislature
in
adopting
a
population
based
reapportionment
plan.
now,
as
to
the
appellants
mr.
swann
or
judge
swann
as
he
is
now
and
dade
county,
the
most
populous
county
in
florida
which
i
too,
i'm
a
resident
and
citizen.
in
this
plan,
dade
county
and
the
house
of
representative
has
an
almost
perfect
break
on
the
mean
legislative
house
district.
i
believe
they're
underrepresented
by
about
0.43
in
their
house
of
representative
districts.
they
are
underrepresented
by
5%
plus
in
the
senate
and
so
i
say
that
so
far
as
the
litigants
here,
the
appellants
are
complaining,
their
complains
are
de
minimus
departures
from
the
mean
average
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate.
and
that
they're
standing
to
complain
is
not
in
its
good
posture
as
it
has
been
in
other
trips
to
this
court
on
which
occasions
i
was
trying
to
agree
with
them.
now,
secondly
within
the
guidelines
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
i
feel
that
they
--
they
are
not
hurt
by
their
own
admission
before
the
lower
court,
the
attorney
for
dade
county
admitted
that
he
couldn't
complain
about
the
formulas
so
far
as
dade
county
was
concerned.
and
of
course,
the
appellant
swann
is
also
a
citizen
and
resident
of
dade
county
and
so
far
as
his
complain
is
concerned
stands
in
the
same
posture.
mr.
earl
faircloth
mr.
swann
was,
yes
sir.
and
dade
county
was
original
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
i
feel
that
he
personally
as
a
citizen
of
dade
county
his
vote
is
not
discriminated
against
by
--
he
is
given
an
equal
way
in
his
county
and
that
what
he
was
seeking
to
begin
with.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
we've
set
his
finding
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
that's
right.
he
had
a
lot
to
complain
about
when
he
started
with
this
county
but
i
say
that
he
now
has
the
very
minimum
departures
on
the
average.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
suppose
they
are
carried
to
that
extreme,
it
would
be
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
there
were
several
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
allowed
amicus
briefs
but
refused
to
allow
the
parties
to
intervene.
so,
on
that
point
i
think
it
is
true
that
many
interveners
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
come
in.
but
may
i
address
myself
to
the
merits
of
the
plan
which
is
before
the
court.
first
of
all,
in
summary
this
plan
has
48
senators
and
117
representatives.
the
maximum
population
variance
ratio
is
1.3
in
our
senate.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor
that
is
the
percentage
difference
between
the
largest
district
and
the
smallest
district.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
believe
that
would
be
correct,
1.3%
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
the
largest
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right,
the
largest
district
is
1.3%
larger
than
the
smallest
district.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
would
be
one
senator.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
by
one
senator,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
we
merely
use
the
population
variant.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
there
are
many
district,
many
multiple
member
districts
in
our
senate
as
well
as
in
the
house
of
representatives.
so,
in
the
house
of
representatives
then
the
maximum
population
variants
ratio
is
1.41%
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
the
legislature
here
and
if
i
may
say
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
rational
plan,
they
started
out
to
apportion
on
the
basis
of
the
congressional
districts.
we
have
12
congressional
districts
in
florida
and
there
is
where
we
get
48
senators.
it
was
thought
to
make
four
senators
from
each
congressional
district
and
of
course
when
they
get
down
with
members
of
the
legislature
to
hammer
out
of
plan
with
the
practicality
is
being
what
they
are.
there
were
--
it
was
impossible
to
subdistrict
all
of
them.
for
example
in
the
most
rural
of
our
congressional
districts
and
we
have
24
rural
counties
and
the
four
senators
ran
at
large
in
all
24
of
these
counties.
i
have
a
feeling
that
in
the
next
session
that
will
be
subdistricted
but
it
will
be
subject
--
subdistricted
that
i
feel
certain
on
the
basis
of
population
as
nearly
as
they
can
come
to
it.
the
part
of
the
rationality
of
the
legislature
was
to
preserve
county
lines
as
much
as
they
could,
but
at
the
same
time
to
base
it
upon
population.
and
so
in
summary
on
the
guidelines,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
of
course
i
agree
with
the
court's
position
in
not
making
a
rigid
mathematical
formula
out
of
it.
i
think
that
would
be
extremely
unworkable.
mathematics
of
valuable
only
so
far
as
i
can
see
for
comparison
purposes
to
plans
that
have
been
found
to
be
valid
and
free
of
invidious
discrimination
and
if
i
could
refer
to
at
least
three
cases
which
i
believe
has
been
before
this
court
in
the
last
months
or
within
the
last
year.
in
the
state
of
colorado
a
plan
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
ration
in
one
house
was
1.46%
and
in
the
other
house
was
1.73%.
in
virginia,
the
population
variants
ratio
in
one
house
was
1.37%
and
in
the
other
1.53%
and
in
wyoming
a
plan
approved
or
affirmed
by
this
court
the
variants
ratio
in
one
house
was
2.08%
and
in
the
other
2.59%
compared
to
florida
with
1.3%
in
the
senate
and
1.41%
in
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
earl
faircloth
all
i
saw
your
honor
was
that
it
came
before
this
court
it
was
affirmed
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
i
did
note
that
florida
in
the
relationship
of
a
number
of
people
or
percentage
of
people
that
takes
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
legislature
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
florida
i
believe
it's
50%
almost
exactly
can
elect
50%
of
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
on
each
individual
theories,
there
would
be
an
explanation.
i
could
take
the
time
of
the
court
in
some
instances
and
i'm
sure
give
a
political
reason
for
it.
why
this
senator
and
this
representative
and
whether
this
group
of
senators
couldn't
agree
on
any
thing
less
than
that.
my
thought
is
that
they
are
now
convinced
and
trying
to
work
toward
an
apportionment
plan
which
is
following
a
rational
basis
and
its
population
based.
i
recommended
to
them
as
my
brother
mr.
paul
pointed
out
that
a
variance
of
more
than
15%
would
be
hard
to
sustain.
i
don't
think
that
should
be
a
rigid
group
because
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
earl
faircloth
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
they
were
in
--
there
was
no
testimony
taken,
no
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no.
i
can't
say
that.
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
faircloth
my
impression
has
been
that
in
a
texas
case
some
briefs
were
filed
and
tables
were
filed
in
this
--
and
--
but
and
i
believe
there
might
have
been
some
testimony
taken
in
the
texas
case.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
that
and
perhaps
i
should
be
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
i
wouldn't
quarrel
with
that
being
a
very
good
idea
though
because
i
think
perfectly,
fine
explanations
could
be
made
about
the
departures
here.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor,
i
will
concede
that
if
it
was
absolutely
no
departure
beyond
15%
that
it
could
be
--still
be
discriminatory.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
will
concede
mr.
justice
white
that
the
brief
contains
a
lot
of
typos
and
population
ratios
and
so
on
and
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
the
court
indicated
that
there
must
proofs
submitted
as
the
justification
from
the
variance
of
an
exact
percentage
population.
well,
then
i'm
sure
that
we
could
comply
but
we
haven't
been
laboring
under
the
apprehension
that
that
is
what
was
required
of
us.
if
it
is,
we
can,
the
15%
rule
of
course
was
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
i'm
afraid
you're
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
exactly
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
exactly
right
and
i
think
that
the
only
value
of
a
15%
rule
or
10%
rule
would
be
to
allow
some
area
for
that
kind
of
maneuvering
in
this
political
picket
as
it
has
been
called.
and
so
i
think
statistically
which
is
what
we
largely
based
it
upon,
the
departures,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
discernable
or
palpable
pattern
here
of
bad
faith
and
an
attempt
to
discriminate
against
anybody.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
convenes
in
april.
mr.
earl
faircloth
for
its
biennial
session,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
your
honor
it
would
be
a
very
extremely
bad
situation
and
really
hard
for
us
to
do.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir,
its
two
years
from
now.
i
might
point
out
and
depends
in
the
florida
legislature
that
--
and
our
governor
that
within
hours
after
this
court's
reversal
and
remand
of
the
previous
case,
the
governor
had
called
the
legislature
into
special
session
and
required
them
to
consider
a
reapportionment
plan
recommended
that
they
consider
it
on
the
congressional
district
lines
in
time
for
the
primary
elections
which
were
then
in
progress
and
the
time
for
qualifying
was
set
back
somewhat
so
that
the
new
plan,
this
plan
could
be
put
into
effect
in
time
for
the
spring
primary
elections.
that
was
all
done
under
this
plan
and
then
in
november
8th,
this
legislature
was
elected
under
this
plan
and
will
meet
in
april
of
this
year
for
its
biennial
session.
so,
we
have
complied
before
the
election
but
i
don't
know
about
the
difficulties
of
complying
before
the
session
meets
in
april.
i
might
submit
your
honor
that
we
might
ask
the
same
indulgence
that
the
court
has
given
to
our
sister
state
of
georgia,
a
plan
which
was
demonstrably
unconstitutional
and
conceded
to
be.
i
believe
the
georgia
ratio
there
was
1.81%
in
one
house
and
2.005
in
the
other.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
it
approved
it
until
a
certain
time
in
the
future.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that's
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right.
and
when
the
district
courts
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
sir?
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i'm
not
sure,
are
you
speaking
of
the
georgia
case
mr.
justice?
mr.
earl
faircloth
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
earl
faircloth
my
brother
paul
has
asked
a
lot,
he
might
--
he
may
have.
mr.
justice
white,
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
faircloth
that
is
right,
it's
approved
by
the
lower
court
as
a
permanent
plan,
acceptable
in
all
respects.
so,
my
thought
is
that
if
it
should
be
found
not
to
be
then
accord
us
the
same
considerations
as
georgia.
tell
us
what's
wrong
with
it
and
let
us
meet
with
this
legislature
that
has
been
elected
and
i
feel
certain
that
this
legislature
will
in
good
faith
apply
with
whatever
the
rule
is
or
whatever
they
understand
the
rule
to
be.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
earl
faircloth
in
georgia?
mr.
earl
faircloth
in
georgia?
mr.
earl
faircloth
oh,
before
this
one,
there
had
been
as
my
brother
paul
pointed
out
many
times
the
legislature
has
considered
the
question
and
have
not
come
up
with
the
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
they've
always
come
up
with
a
plan
and
they
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
this
court
has
now
said
they
were
all
no
good
except
this
one
and
i'm
hoping
that
this
court
will
say
the
plan
now
is
good.
i
haven't
felt
that
the
others
were
but
i
do
feel
that
this
one
is.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
haven't
felt
to
the
others
met
the
standards
of
the
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
other
cases
but
i
do
feel
that
this
one
does.
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
after
baker
versus
carr
in
1962
they
immediately
--
mr.
swann's
case
was
then
pending.
the
legislature
met
and
approved
something
that
was
rejected
by
the
people
in
november
of
1962.
now,
the
governor
called
the
legislature
back
into
session
immediately
after
the
general
election
in
november
of
‘62
and
they
met
for
30
days
and
couldn't
agree
on
anything.
then,
on
march
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
the
district
court
had
ordered
that
it
be
done.
i
believe
between
the
general
election
rejection
of
the
plan
in
november
1962,
the
court
entered
an
order
saying
that
our
constitution
and
our
formula,
38
senators,
95
house
members
were
null
and
void
and
so
we
did
meet,
the
court
approved
a
plan,
adopted
in
january
of
1963
for
112
representatives
and
i
think
43
senators,
they
met
at
the
regular
biennial
session
in
1963
and
brought
forth
another
plan
which
was
appealed
and
which
this
court
held
didn't
meet
the
standard.
and
then
another
plan
in
response
to
that
was
submitted
which
i
didn't
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
georgia
still
hasn't
come
as
close
as
we
have
your
honor
and
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir,
very
too.
mr.
justice
black,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
georgia
we
have
a
plan
which
is
agreed
not
to
meet
the
standard
but
they
have
been
given
time
within
which
to
do
it
and
i
think
the
record
of
florida
legislature
at
this
time
on
this
performance
it
comes
in
my
opinion
so
close
and
it's
free
enough
of
invidious
discrimination
that
any
further
guidelines
will
be
promptly
acted
upon.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
believe
the
first
order
was
issued
some
time
in
july
of
1962.
florida
has
been
in
it
since
baker
versus
carr
and
before
and
at
that
time
was
approximately
the
bottom
of
the
list
in
the
relationship
of
the
population
to
representation
in
the
state.
i
make
no
defense
of
that
but
i
do
make
a
defense
of
the
present
attitude
of
the
legislature
and
its
acceptance
of
population
has
to
guide
and
submit
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
well,
i
happen
to
agree
with
it
and
believe
that
there
is
a
sense
of
the
desire
to
comply
with
the
guidelines
as
they
understand
them
and
they
will.
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
agree.
i
agree
exactly,
it
must
be
--
mr.
earl
faircloth
i
do.
i
haven't
agreed
in
the
past
but
i
do
with
this
plan.
mr.
earl
faircloth
what?
mr.
earl
faircloth
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
faircloth
if
there
is
to
be
a
rule
chiseled
in
stone
as
to
percentage
then
if
we
knew
that
i
believe
the
legislature
would
comply.
if
there
is
to
be
a
flexibility
but
not
as
much
as
we
have
in
those
in
this
plan
tell
us
what
it
is
and
give
us
the
opportunity
to
meet
at
our
next
session
with
this
newly
elected
legislature
which
is
the
greatest
population
base
legislature
in
history
of
our
state
and
i
think
there
will
be
a
compliance.
i
don't
agree
of
course
with
my
friend
and
brother
mr.
paul
in
his
lopsided
view
of
the
urban
versus
rural
discrimination.
i
note
in
his
brief
on
page
22
i
think
it
is,
he
makes
a
statement
that
no
single
urban
county
is
overrepresented
in
both
houses
while
at
least
five
rural
counties
are.
i
would
submit
that
--
let's
take
three,
volusia
county
that's
where
the
daytona
beach
is,
not
exactly
a
rural
place
overrepresented
in
both
houses.
pinellas,
not
st.
petersburg,
not
exactly
a
rural
county,
overrepresented
in
both
houses
and
brevard
where
kate
kennedy
is
located
and
that
too
is
the
situation
and
that
is
taking
sarasota
county
where
the
culture
and
art
center
of
florida
not
exactly
a
rural
county,
it's
the
12th
largest
county
in
florida,
overrepresented
in
both
houses.
so,
three
out
of
12
of
the
urban
counties
overrepresented
in
both
houses
and
as
mr.
paul
says
five
rural
counties,
overrepresented
in
both
houses
there
are
67
counties
leaving
by
his
definition
there
55
of
them
rural
and
five
out
of
55
being
overrepresented
in
both
houses
as
compared
to
three
out
of
12
urban
counties
overrepresented
in
both
counties
i
think
is
a
good
record
on
the
ballots.
so,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
submit
that
this
plan
under
consideration
by
the
court
is
a
plan
which
is
rational,
it
lacks
invidious
discrimination,
it
does
not
gerrymander
and
lead
the
three
urban
counties
i've
just
mentioned
went
republic
in
the
last
election.
so,
it's
not
gerrymandered
for
political
advantage,
it
is
a
not
gerrymandered
for
racial
disadvantage
or
discrimination
in
any
way
and
comes
close
enough
to
the
mathematical
guidelines
that
we've
understood
that
i
submit
it
is
a
plan
that
meets
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
earl
faircloth
no
sir,
they
are
urban.
they're
urban
counties
your
honor.
thank
you
your
honor.
