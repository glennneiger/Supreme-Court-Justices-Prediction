mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
time
this
case
has
been
before
this
court.
the
plan
reviewed
today
represents
the
eight
opportunity,
the
florida
legislature
has
had
in
the
last
four
years
to
adopt
a
constitutional
apportionment
plan
not
counting
numerous
opportunities
before
that.
this
case
was
filed
in
march
1962.
in
1964,
this
court
reversed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
case.
on
february
25th
of
this
year,
this
court
again
reversed
the
district
court
which
had
given
the
legislature
until
1969
to
convene
a
validly
apportion
of
the
legislature
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
that
a
valid
reapportionment
plan
could
be
made
effective
for
the
1966
elections.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
latest
decision
of
the
district
court
which
held
the
deviations
in
the
last
florida
legislative
plan
adopted
march
10th
did
not
discriminate
to
use
the
lower
court's
language
to
any
great
extent.
we
are
here
for
the
third
time
because
we
believe
the
standards
of
your
reapportionment
cases
have
been
disregarded
by
the
district
court
for
the
third
time.
the
florida
plan
is
not
an
honest
and
good
faith
effort
to
construct
districts
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature
as
nearly
equal
in
population
as
it's
practicable
with
only
such
minimal
departures
as
necessity
demands.
it
is
not
a
plan
under
which
all
votes
are
counted
equally.
the
current
plan
provides
48
senators
and
117
representatives.
the
court
below
found
that
the
senate
districts
ranged
from
15.9%
overrepresented
to
10.56%
underrepresented
or
a
deferential
in
the
senate
between
the
largest
district
and
the
smallest
district
of
over
30%.
in
the
house,
the
court
found
that
the
district's
range
from
18.28%
overrepresented
to
15.27%
underrepresented
or
a
deferential
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
districts
of
over
41%.
now,
in
plain
language
this
means
that
three
votes
in
the
most
overrepresented
senate
district
will
have
the
weight
of
four
votes
in
the
most
underrepresented
senate
district.
and
that
four
votes
in
the
most
overrepresented
house
district
will
have
the
weight
of
five
and
a
half
votes
in
the
most
underrepresented
house
district.
standing
by
themselves
alone,
we
think
these
variances
are
too
great
to
pass
the
constitutional
test
laid
down
by
this
court.
however,
when
we
couple
list
statistics
with
an
inquiry
to
see
if
this
was
an
honest
in
good
faith
attempt
to
construct
districts
as
nearly
equal
in
population
as
practicable,
we
come
upon
some
rather
startling
facts.
this
plan
was
adopted
by
an
experienced
legislature
in
direct
derogation
of
the
reapportionment
standards
which
had
been
clearly
articulated
to
it.
first,
by
this
court
in
its
1964
decision,
secondly,
by
our
lower
court
in
its
1965
decision
striking
down
a
legislative
plan
in
which
that
court
stated
and
i
quote
from
that
decision,
“only
such
minimal
departures
as
necessity
demands
will
be
permitted.
variations
are
to
be
sanctioned
only
when
they
cannot
be
avoided.”
thirdly,
by
my
brother
counsel,
the
attorney
general
in
a
document
which
he
distributed
to
every
member
of
this
legislature
before
the
legislature
began
to
sit,
entitled
“criteria
and
guidelines”
for
reapportionment
as
established
by
the
federal
courts.
in
that
document,
he
told
each
member
of
the
legislature
the
following;
the
allowable
mathematical
percentage
variants
differs
in
some
of
the
supreme
court
decisions.
however,
a
study
of
these
decisions
reveals
that
a
percentage
variants
of
more
than
15%
would
be
difficult
to
sustain
as
complying
with
one
man,
one
vote.
and
lastly,
the
legislature
had
before
it
the
very
plan
which
appellants
had
filed
in
this
proceeding
at
the
request
of
the
court.
the
plan
which
had
the
same
none
population
characteristics,
the
integrity
of
county
lines
and
the
contiguity
of
the
districts
and
yet
in
the
plans
submitted
by
appellants
which
the
legislature
had
before
it
for
consideration.
there
was
less
than
a
3.5%
variance.
now,
with
all
of
that
guidance,
what
do
we
find
that
the
legislature
adopted?
a
plan
with
variances
well
in
excess
of
15%
and
a
plan
that
manifest
a
clear
pattern
of
discrimination
against
the
more
populous
counties.
the
only
counties
underrepresented
in
the
senate
by
10%
or
more
are
two
of
the
most
populous
counties
in
the
state,
duval
and
palm
beach
which
ranked
second
and
seventh
in
the
state.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
the
variance
that
would
be
permitted?
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
laid
down
any
algebraic
formula
or
variance
that
will
be
permitted.
i
think
the
formula
is
laid
down
in
reynolds
versus
simms
and
in
roman
versus
sincock
is
that
there
should
be
no
variances
from
the
ideal
standard
except
minimal
ones
and
ones
which
can
be
justified
and
the
plan
before
the
court
there
is
no
justification
for
the
size
of
the
variances
on
the
legislative
plan.
over
14%
of
the
state's
population
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no.
i
do
not
think
that
that
large
of
tolerance
would
fit
their
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
think
that
the
tolerance
depends
upon
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
plan.
this
court
has
never
laid
down
an
exact
mathematical
formula.
it
is
characterized
the
tolerances
as
minimal
and
i
think
that
the
tolerances
in
this
plan
cannot
be
characterized
as
minimal.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
think
certainly
not
more
than
3%
or
4%
would
be
the
minimal
tolerances
and
then
only
if
it
were
shown
that
those
tolerances
could
not
have
been
avoided
in
the
plan
which
was
adopted.
those
two
counties
which
are
underrepresented
by
more
than
10%
in
this
plan
contained
14%
of
the
state's
population
or
in
other
words,
one
out
of
every
seven
people
in
florida
lives
in
those
populous
underrepresented
counties.
in
addition,
one
of
those
two
is
also
underrepresented
in
the
house
plan
by
almost
8%.
so,
there
is
accumulative
effect
of
discrimination
that
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
lucas
effect.
now,
what
do
we
find
on
the
other
side
who
is
the
most
overrepresented
in
the
senate?
three
of
the
least
populous
counties
by
over
15%
in
the
house
the
same
pattern
of
discrimination
exist.
the
majority
of
the
overrepresented
districts
consist
of
the
less
populous
counties
with
a
little
manatee
leading
the
list
with
18.3%
overrepresented
whereas
the
eight
largest
county
in
the
state
is
15.3%
underrepresented.
we
have
given
several
other
examples
in
our
brief
of
this
pattern
of
discrimination
against
the
populous
counties
which
we
find
in
this
plan.
now,
the
lower
court
and
the
attorney
general
passed
this
discrimination
off
in
a
very
cavalier
way
without
making
any
effort
to
explain
the
reason
for
this
discrimination.
the
lower
court
concedes
in
its
decision
the
deviation
exist.
we
submit
the
burden
is
on
the
attorney
general
to
justify
it.
these
variations
are
not
ones
which
in
the
language
of
the
court's
opinion
could
not
be
avoided.
they
cannot
be
justified
on
any
desire
not
to
split
county
lines.
for
example,
in
the
plan,
we
find
in
one
district
which
would
have
been
ideally
apportioned,
the
legislature
purposely
malapportioned
it.
the
legislature
clearly
was
not
concerned
here
with
breaking
county
lines
but
with
breaking
hearts,
hearts
of
the
legislators
who
seeks
--
should
have
been
reapportioned.
we
have
a
curious
philosophy
that
seems
to
prevail
in
the
florida
legislature
and
that
is
that
the
legislative
seats
belong
to
the
individual
legislatures
who
hold
them
not
to
the
people
who
elected
them.
one
more
fact
clearly
indicates
a
lack
of
good
faith
in
the
attempt
which
the
legislature
made
and
that
is
the
size
of
the
plan
examined
today.
this
is
the
largest
legislature
in
the
history
of
florida.
since
the
legislature
sometime
ago
began
tinkering
with
the
size
of
the
legislature.
the
senate
has
crept
from
its
original
size
of
32
to
48
and
the
house
from
68
members
to
a
117
members.
reapportionment
in
florida
has
come
to
me
not
reallocation
of
existing
seats
but
the
addition
of
new
seats
in
playing
unvarnished
ad
hock
personal
legislation
to
keep
the
legislators
there
who
no
longer
belong
there
under
the
latest
federal
census.
the
personal
nature
of
the
present
plan
if
illustrated
by
the
grand
fathering
of
three
of
the
senators
and
providing
a
residence
requirement
whereby
the
people
are
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who
resides
in
their
district
to
ensure
the
election
of
a
favorite
senator
from
the
less
populous
and
different
district.
if
this
court's
standards
are
to
be
avoided
by
such
patently
bad
faith
attempts,
the
importance
of
reapportionment
in
the
revitalization
of
our
state
legislatures
will
be
lost.
we
submit
that
legislative
packing
is
not
good
faith
legislative
reappointment.
that
is
why
in
the
plan
we
submitted
we
started
with
the
last
constitutionally
valid
plan
approved
by
the
people
of
florida.
the
plan
which
the
legislature
has
adopted,
they
have
been
very
careful
not
to
submit
to
the
vote
of
the
people.
we
started
with
this
last
constitutionally
valid
plan.
the
32-man
senate
in
a
68-man
house
within
those
limits
legally
set
before
unreviewed
state
court
decisions
erroneously
eroded
them
appellants
have
at
the
lower
court's
request
filed
a
plan
under
which
no
county
has
split,
all
districts
are
contiguous
and
the
maximum
deviation
is
less
than
3.5%.
our
plan
is
rather
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
yes.
we
started
with
the
last
constitutionally
valid
size
house
in
legislature,
a
32-man
senate
and
a
30
--
and
a
68-man
house.
the
plan
which
is
reviewed
here
today
has
a
substantially
larger
numbers
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
48
senators
and
a
117
representatives.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no.
my
virtue
of
--
as
i
said
unreviewed
state
court
decisions
which
have
eroded
the
original
number
size
and
have
advised
the
legislature
in
an
advisory
opinion
that
the
federal
court
decisions
have
knocked
the
number
limitations
out
of
the
florida
constitution.
we
did
not
make
that
contention
although
we
do
think
those
decisions
are
erroneous.
they
have
not
been
reviewed
by
this
court.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
we
think
that
is
the
appropriate
remedy
at
this
stage
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
or
to
give
directions
to
the
district
court
to
put
that
plan
into
effect
in
time
for
the
april
session
of
the
florida
legislature.
our
plan
has
been
rather
sarcastically
described
in
--
by
one
of
the
appellees
as
a
plan
that
disregards
relevant
factors
other
than
population.
now,
appellees
don't
tell
us
what
those
other
relevant
factors
are.
clearly,
they're
not
county
lines
and
they
are
not
contiguity
of
districts.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
each
state's
plan
must
be
examined
in
the
light
of
its
own
special
circumstances.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
reynolds
versus
simms
what
is
marginally
permissible
in
one
state
maybe
unsatisfactory
in
another
depending
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
attorney
general
has
never
commented
on
the
appellants
plan
or
more
importantly
has
never
attempted
to
justify
the
deviations
in
the
florida
plan
by
any
unique
circumstances
relating
to
florida
instead
he
devotes
a
great
part
of
his
brief
comparing
the
florida
plan
with
other
states
if
these
were
some
justification
for
the
wide
variances
in
the
florida
plan.
appellants
plan
shows
that
these
wide
variances
cannot
be
justified
by
a
desire
not
to
split
county
line
or
to
avoid
none
contiguous
districts.
we
think
the
attorney
general
should
tell
the
court
today
what
justification
there
is
for
these
wide
variances
in
the
florida
plan
and
explain
for
what
reason
these
variances
exist
in
the
legislative
plan
when
they
do
not
exist
in
the
plan
submitted
to
the
court.
where
the
variances
are
as
great
as
they
are
in
the
florida
plan,
the
burden
is
on
the
attorney
general
to
justify
their
constitutionality.
we
believe
that
the
florida
experience
indicates
the
need
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
that
there
is
no
maximum
permissible
deviation.
that
the
court's
reapportionment
formula
is
not
algebra
but
that
only
such
variances
from
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
will
be
tolerated
as
cannot
be
avoided.
since
the
reapportionment
cases,
the
lower
courts
have
gone
in
two
directions.
one
group
has
taken
its
obligation
seriously
and
has
attempted
to
determine
how
close
a
reapportionment
plan
can
come
to
meeting
exactly
the
reapportionment
standard.
that
is
that
each
vote
should
be
counted
equally.
they
have
compared
the
enacted
legislative
plan
with
the
one
suggested
as
the
best
possible
and
if
there
is
no
justification
for
the
variances
in
the
enacted
plan
they
have
judicially
crafted
it
or
it
enacted
a
better
plan.
another
group
has
taken
the
opposite
approach
to
see
how
far
the
legislature
can
deviate
for
maximum
equality
without
transgressing
constitutional
limitations.
this
group
accords
a
presumption
of
validity
to
the
act
of
an
invidiously
discriminatory
body.
if
this
court
is
going
to
allow
its
reapportionment
decisions
to
be
diluted
by
this
maximum
permissible
deviation
school
we
believe
it
will
have
entered
the
political
picket
and
come
out
with
nothing
but
a
thorn.
in
its
february
decision
this
year,
this
court
directed
that
a
valid
reapportionment
plan
should
be
made
effective
in
florida
for
the
1966
alleged
elections.
we
believe
that
the
legislature
and
the
district
court
fail
to
carry
out
this
mandate.
in
the
language
of
reynolds
and
simms
if
there
has
ever
been
a
case
in
which
the
legislature
has
failed
to
reapportion
according
to
federal
constitutional
requisites
after
having
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
do
so
and
therefore
judicial
relief
becomes
appropriate
this
is
that
case.
but
the
florida
legislature
does
not
meet
until
april
4th.
the
adoption
of
a
new
constitution
for
the
state
of
florida
it's
one
of
its
prime
announced
objectives
of
the
new
legislature.
we
submit
proper
judicial
relief
would
be
to
place
into
effect
appellant's
plan
where
the
maximum
deviation
is
less
than
3.5%
in
time
to
be
effective
for
the
1967
session
of
the
florida
legislature
and
before
the
adoption
of
a
new
constitution.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no.
that
relates
strictly
to
the
relief,
the
court
of
course
has
several
alternatives,
they
could
send
the
matter
back
to
the
district
court
for
purposes
of
providing
the
appropriate
relief
or
they
could
direct
that
the
legislature
itself
placed
into
effect
a
constitutional
plan
prior
to
the
meeting
of
the
1967
session.
but
we
think
that
it
would
clearly
be
within
the
court's
discretion
in
view
of
the
long
reapportionment
history
in
florida
and
legislatures
continued
refusal
to
avail
the
mandates
of
this
court
and
to
enact
the
constitutional
plan.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
place
this
plan
in
to
effect.
we
do
not
think
the
people
of
florida
should
be
denied
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature
any
longer
particularly
when
constitutional
revision
is
directly
on
the
rise.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
it
would
be
if
the
legislature
had
any
desire
to
so
do,
the
plan
which
we
submitted
to
the
court
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
and
the
legislature
did
not
even
consider
it,
never
even
got
to
commit
it.
but
it
would
be
certainly
be
perfectly
possible.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
point
raised
by
the
attorney
general
that
we
don't
have
standing
to
be
here.
i
must
confess
that
he
was
making
that
argument,
i
was
reminded
a
little
of
the
line
competes,
what
mad,
what
hot,
what
fevered
pursued
is
this.
i
think
clearly
that
by
virtue
of
the
plan
that
we
have
filed
in
shown
that
appellant
swann
has
the
right
to
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature.
under
our
plan,
the
appellant
would
be
much
more
accurately
represented
than
under
the
plan
adopted
by
the
legislature
and
the
attorney
general
makes
the
error
several
times
in
his
briefs
that
saying
the
date
is
adequately
represented
and
the
senate
date
is
underrepresented
in
the
legislative
plan
to
the
extent
of
5.9%.
i
think
the
important
point
to
that
made
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
that
is
that
every
other
intervener
who
has
attempted
to
intervene
in
these
proceedings
to
present
their
particular
underrepresentation
problems
has
been
denied,
leaved
to
intervene
on
the
ground
that
this
appellant
was
expressing
the
position
of
all
the
under
represented
voters
in
the
state
of
florida.
for
example,
senator
mchugh
from
jacksonville,
duval
county
which
is
badly
underrepresented
in
this
plan
is
sought
to
intervene
on
several
occasions
and
he
has
been
denied
his
right
to
intervene.
of
course
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
the
standing
to
sue
is
to
insure
that
there's
an
adversary
proceeding
or
a
case
or
a
controversy
and
i
think
that
has
clearly
been
met
here
and
i
think
that
without
question
that
we
do
have
standing
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
am
not
familiar
mr.
justice
white
with
the
details
of
the
wyoming
case
or
what
evidence
may
have
been
in
the
record
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
as
they
relate
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
there
may
have
been
some
justification
in
the
record
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
don't
think
that
that
particular
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
think
that
those
situations
may
not
be
comparable
situations
with
the
florida
situation.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i'm
not
familiar
of
what
evidence
may
have
been
in
the
record
in
each
of
those
cases
but
i
think
in
the
plan
before
us
there
is
clearly
no
indication
or
no
explanation
anywhere
in
the
attorney
general
has
still
not
told
us
of
the
reason
for
these
variances
except
perhaps
to
suggest
that
there
are
political
reasons.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
was
correct
in
burns
versus
richardson,
the
court
very
clearly
said
that
there
must
be
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
variances
and
there
was
an
opportunity
in
a
hearing
held
and
i
read
from
the
record
at
page
88,
judge
jones
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
that
is
in
the
record
of
the
florida
case
filed
in
this
proceeding,
the
very
last
hearing
held
on
this
particular
plan
at
page
88,
judge
jones
says,
“is
there
any
other
evidence
to
be
introduced
to
this
hearing?”
“mr.
faircloth:
“the
state
has
none
your
honor
except
the
exhibit
house
bill
17x.”
i
submit
that's
commendable
candor
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
because
there
isn't
any
evidence
to
explain
and
there
can't
be
any
to
explain
why
these
wide
variances
exist
in
this
particular
plan.
they
are
there
as
i
said
is
pure
unvarnished
ad
hoc
litigation
of
these
legislators
who
think
the
seats
belong
to
them
instead
of
the
people
that
rejected
them.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
is
to
the
number
of
plans
submitted
in
response
to
the
court's
request.
there
are
at
least
10
plans
submitted
in
response
to
the
court's
request
coming
very
close
or
as
close
as
the
plan
submitted
by
appellants,
submitted
by
political
science
departments,
submitted
by
interested
citizens,
submitted
by
state
legislators
who
have
been
in
the
minority
in
the
state
legislature.
the
appellant's
plan
was
a
jointly
submitted
plan
submitted
by
dade
county
by
judge
swann,
by
the
league
of
women
voters
and
by
the
government
research
counsel
which
is
a
citizen's
--
independent
citizens
pacific
group
in
dade
county.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
there
have
been
four
plans
submitted
by
the
legislature.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
this
is
the
fourth
plan.
the
first
plan
was
rejected
overwhelmingly
by
vote
of
the
people
of
florida
in
the
legislature
have
never
permitted
the
people
to
vote
again
on
the
reapportionment
plan.
there
is
a
chance
that
anyone
of
these
plans
that
the
legislature
has
adopted
could
ever
be
accepted
by
vote
of
the
people
in
the
state.
that
second
--
then
the
legislature
came
along
the
adopted
a
second
plan
without
a
vote.
in
that
plan,
14%
of
the
people
in
the
state
elected
the
senate
and
29%
of
the
people
in
the
state
elected
the
house.
this
was
after
the
--
this
supreme
court's
decision.
the
legislature
then
came
along
in
9th
june
of
1965
which
was
also
after
this
supreme
court's
decision
and
again
after
the
criteria,
the
attorney
general
passed
out
a
similar
set
of
criteria
to
that
session
of
the
legislature
and
that
plan
was
so
bad
that
even
our
district
court
held
that
one
unconstitutional.
and
now,
they
come
with
the
fourth
plan
which
we
submit
is
also
unconstitutional.
we
submit
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no,
not
for
a
hearing
mr.
justice
brennan
but
for
the
necessity
of
evidence
being
in
the
record
to
sustain
any
variances
or
deviations
that
there
maybe
in
the
plan.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
he
were,
that
case
deal
is
primarily
with
multi
member
districts
but
i
think
the
rule
would
still
be
same.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
as
the
attorney
general
has
said,
unless
you
are
going
to
chisel
a
rule
in
stone
and
send
it
on
a
stone
tablet
to
the
florida
legislature
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
proper
reapportionment
plan.
we
submit
that
this
is
clearly
a
case
which
begs
for
judicial
relief
and
in
time
for
opening
of
the
florida
legislative
session
in
april
of
1967
and
before
this
malapportioned
legislature
attempts
to
tinker
with
the
basic
law
of
our
state
and
submit
a
new
constitution.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
time
this
case
has
been
before
this
court.
the
plan
reviewed
today
represents
the
eight
opportunity,
the
florida
legislature
has
had
in
the
last
four
years
to
adopt
a
constitutional
apportionment
plan
not
counting
numerous
opportunities
before
that.
this
case
was
filed
in
march
1962.
in
1964,
this
court
reversed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
case.
on
february
25th
of
this
year,
this
court
again
reversed
the
district
court
which
had
given
the
legislature
until
1969
to
convene
a
validly
apportion
of
the
legislature
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
that
a
valid
reapportionment
plan
could
be
made
effective
for
the
1966
elections.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
latest
decision
of
the
district
court
which
held
the
deviations
in
the
last
florida
legislative
plan
adopted
march
10th
did
not
discriminate
to
use
the
lower
court's
language
to
any
great
extent.
we
are
here
for
the
third
time
because
we
believe
the
standards
of
your
reapportionment
cases
have
been
disregarded
by
the
district
court
for
the
third
time.
the
florida
plan
is
not
an
honest
and
good
faith
effort
to
construct
districts
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature
as
nearly
equal
in
population
as
it's
practicable
with
only
such
minimal
departures
as
necessity
demands.
it
is
not
a
plan
under
which
all
votes
are
counted
equally.
the
current
plan
provides
48
senators
and
117
representatives.
the
court
below
found
that
the
senate
districts
ranged
from
15.9%
overrepresented
to
10.56%
underrepresented
or
a
deferential
in
the
senate
between
the
largest
district
and
the
smallest
district
of
over
30%.
in
the
house,
the
court
found
that
the
district's
range
from
18.28%
overrepresented
to
15.27%
underrepresented
or
a
deferential
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
districts
of
over
41%.
now,
in
plain
language
this
means
that
three
votes
in
the
most
overrepresented
senate
district
will
have
the
weight
of
four
votes
in
the
most
underrepresented
senate
district.
and
that
four
votes
in
the
most
overrepresented
house
district
will
have
the
weight
of
five
and
a
half
votes
in
the
most
underrepresented
house
district.
standing
by
themselves
alone,
we
think
these
variances
are
too
great
to
pass
the
constitutional
test
laid
down
by
this
court.
however,
when
we
couple
list
statistics
with
an
inquiry
to
see
if
this
was
an
honest
in
good
faith
attempt
to
construct
districts
as
nearly
equal
in
population
as
practicable,
we
come
upon
some
rather
startling
facts.
this
plan
was
adopted
by
an
experienced
legislature
in
direct
derogation
of
the
reapportionment
standards
which
had
been
clearly
articulated
to
it.
first,
by
this
court
in
its
1964
decision,
secondly,
by
our
lower
court
in
its
1965
decision
striking
down
a
legislative
plan
in
which
that
court
stated
and
i
quote
from
that
decision,
“only
such
minimal
departures
as
necessity
demands
will
be
permitted.
variations
are
to
be
sanctioned
only
when
they
cannot
be
avoided.”
thirdly,
by
my
brother
counsel,
the
attorney
general
in
a
document
which
he
distributed
to
every
member
of
this
legislature
before
the
legislature
began
to
sit,
entitled
“criteria
and
guidelines”
for
reapportionment
as
established
by
the
federal
courts.
in
that
document,
he
told
each
member
of
the
legislature
the
following;
the
allowable
mathematical
percentage
variants
differs
in
some
of
the
supreme
court
decisions.
however,
a
study
of
these
decisions
reveals
that
a
percentage
variants
of
more
than
15%
would
be
difficult
to
sustain
as
complying
with
one
man,
one
vote.
and
lastly,
the
legislature
had
before
it
the
very
plan
which
appellants
had
filed
in
this
proceeding
at
the
request
of
the
court.
the
plan
which
had
the
same
none
population
characteristics,
the
integrity
of
county
lines
and
the
contiguity
of
the
districts
and
yet
in
the
plans
submitted
by
appellants
which
the
legislature
had
before
it
for
consideration.
there
was
less
than
a
3.5%
variance.
now,
with
all
of
that
guidance,
what
do
we
find
that
the
legislature
adopted?
a
plan
with
variances
well
in
excess
of
15%
and
a
plan
that
manifest
a
clear
pattern
of
discrimination
against
the
more
populous
counties.
the
only
counties
underrepresented
in
the
senate
by
10%
or
more
are
two
of
the
most
populous
counties
in
the
state,
duval
and
palm
beach
which
ranked
second
and
seventh
in
the
state.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
the
variance
that
would
be
permitted?
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
laid
down
any
algebraic
formula
or
variance
that
will
be
permitted.
i
think
the
formula
is
laid
down
in
reynolds
versus
simms
and
in
roman
versus
sincock
is
that
there
should
be
no
variances
from
the
ideal
standard
except
minimal
ones
and
ones
which
can
be
justified
and
the
plan
before
the
court
there
is
no
justification
for
the
size
of
the
variances
on
the
legislative
plan.
over
14%
of
the
state's
population
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no.
i
do
not
think
that
that
large
of
tolerance
would
fit
their
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
think
that
the
tolerance
depends
upon
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
plan.
this
court
has
never
laid
down
an
exact
mathematical
formula.
it
is
characterized
the
tolerances
as
minimal
and
i
think
that
the
tolerances
in
this
plan
cannot
be
characterized
as
minimal.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
think
certainly
not
more
than
3%
or
4%
would
be
the
minimal
tolerances
and
then
only
if
it
were
shown
that
those
tolerances
could
not
have
been
avoided
in
the
plan
which
was
adopted.
those
two
counties
which
are
underrepresented
by
more
than
10%
in
this
plan
contained
14%
of
the
state's
population
or
in
other
words,
one
out
of
every
seven
people
in
florida
lives
in
those
populous
underrepresented
counties.
in
addition,
one
of
those
two
is
also
underrepresented
in
the
house
plan
by
almost
8%.
so,
there
is
accumulative
effect
of
discrimination
that
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
lucas
effect.
now,
what
do
we
find
on
the
other
side
who
is
the
most
overrepresented
in
the
senate?
three
of
the
least
populous
counties
by
over
15%
in
the
house
the
same
pattern
of
discrimination
exist.
the
majority
of
the
overrepresented
districts
consist
of
the
less
populous
counties
with
a
little
manatee
leading
the
list
with
18.3%
overrepresented
whereas
the
eight
largest
county
in
the
state
is
15.3%
underrepresented.
we
have
given
several
other
examples
in
our
brief
of
this
pattern
of
discrimination
against
the
populous
counties
which
we
find
in
this
plan.
now,
the
lower
court
and
the
attorney
general
passed
this
discrimination
off
in
a
very
cavalier
way
without
making
any
effort
to
explain
the
reason
for
this
discrimination.
the
lower
court
concedes
in
its
decision
the
deviation
exist.
we
submit
the
burden
is
on
the
attorney
general
to
justify
it.
these
variations
are
not
ones
which
in
the
language
of
the
court's
opinion
could
not
be
avoided.
they
cannot
be
justified
on
any
desire
not
to
split
county
lines.
for
example,
in
the
plan,
we
find
in
one
district
which
would
have
been
ideally
apportioned,
the
legislature
purposely
malapportioned
it.
the
legislature
clearly
was
not
concerned
here
with
breaking
county
lines
but
with
breaking
hearts,
hearts
of
the
legislators
who
seeks
--
should
have
been
reapportioned.
we
have
a
curious
philosophy
that
seems
to
prevail
in
the
florida
legislature
and
that
is
that
the
legislative
seats
belong
to
the
individual
legislatures
who
hold
them
not
to
the
people
who
elected
them.
one
more
fact
clearly
indicates
a
lack
of
good
faith
in
the
attempt
which
the
legislature
made
and
that
is
the
size
of
the
plan
examined
today.
this
is
the
largest
legislature
in
the
history
of
florida.
since
the
legislature
sometime
ago
began
tinkering
with
the
size
of
the
legislature.
the
senate
has
crept
from
its
original
size
of
32
to
48
and
the
house
from
68
members
to
a
117
members.
reapportionment
in
florida
has
come
to
me
not
reallocation
of
existing
seats
but
the
addition
of
new
seats
in
playing
unvarnished
ad
hock
personal
legislation
to
keep
the
legislators
there
who
no
longer
belong
there
under
the
latest
federal
census.
the
personal
nature
of
the
present
plan
if
illustrated
by
the
grand
fathering
of
three
of
the
senators
and
providing
a
residence
requirement
whereby
the
people
are
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who
resides
in
their
district
to
ensure
the
election
of
a
favorite
senator
from
the
less
populous
and
different
district.
if
this
court's
standards
are
to
be
avoided
by
such
patently
bad
faith
attempts,
the
importance
of
reapportionment
in
the
revitalization
of
our
state
legislatures
will
be
lost.
we
submit
that
legislative
packing
is
not
good
faith
legislative
reappointment.
that
is
why
in
the
plan
we
submitted
we
started
with
the
last
constitutionally
valid
plan
approved
by
the
people
of
florida.
the
plan
which
the
legislature
has
adopted,
they
have
been
very
careful
not
to
submit
to
the
vote
of
the
people.
we
started
with
this
last
constitutionally
valid
plan.
the
32-man
senate
in
a
68-man
house
within
those
limits
legally
set
before
unreviewed
state
court
decisions
erroneously
eroded
them
appellants
have
at
the
lower
court's
request
filed
a
plan
under
which
no
county
has
split,
all
districts
are
contiguous
and
the
maximum
deviation
is
less
than
3.5%.
our
plan
is
rather
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
yes.
we
started
with
the
last
constitutionally
valid
size
house
in
legislature,
a
32-man
senate
and
a
30
--
and
a
68-man
house.
the
plan
which
is
reviewed
here
today
has
a
substantially
larger
numbers
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
48
senators
and
a
117
representatives.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no.
my
virtue
of
--
as
i
said
unreviewed
state
court
decisions
which
have
eroded
the
original
number
size
and
have
advised
the
legislature
in
an
advisory
opinion
that
the
federal
court
decisions
have
knocked
the
number
limitations
out
of
the
florida
constitution.
we
did
not
make
that
contention
although
we
do
think
those
decisions
are
erroneous.
they
have
not
been
reviewed
by
this
court.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
we
think
that
is
the
appropriate
remedy
at
this
stage
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
or
to
give
directions
to
the
district
court
to
put
that
plan
into
effect
in
time
for
the
april
session
of
the
florida
legislature.
our
plan
has
been
rather
sarcastically
described
in
--
by
one
of
the
appellees
as
a
plan
that
disregards
relevant
factors
other
than
population.
now,
appellees
don't
tell
us
what
those
other
relevant
factors
are.
clearly,
they're
not
county
lines
and
they
are
not
contiguity
of
districts.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
each
state's
plan
must
be
examined
in
the
light
of
its
own
special
circumstances.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
reynolds
versus
simms
what
is
marginally
permissible
in
one
state
maybe
unsatisfactory
in
another
depending
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
attorney
general
has
never
commented
on
the
appellants
plan
or
more
importantly
has
never
attempted
to
justify
the
deviations
in
the
florida
plan
by
any
unique
circumstances
relating
to
florida
instead
he
devotes
a
great
part
of
his
brief
comparing
the
florida
plan
with
other
states
if
these
were
some
justification
for
the
wide
variances
in
the
florida
plan.
appellants
plan
shows
that
these
wide
variances
cannot
be
justified
by
a
desire
not
to
split
county
line
or
to
avoid
none
contiguous
districts.
we
think
the
attorney
general
should
tell
the
court
today
what
justification
there
is
for
these
wide
variances
in
the
florida
plan
and
explain
for
what
reason
these
variances
exist
in
the
legislative
plan
when
they
do
not
exist
in
the
plan
submitted
to
the
court.
where
the
variances
are
as
great
as
they
are
in
the
florida
plan,
the
burden
is
on
the
attorney
general
to
justify
their
constitutionality.
we
believe
that
the
florida
experience
indicates
the
need
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
that
there
is
no
maximum
permissible
deviation.
that
the
court's
reapportionment
formula
is
not
algebra
but
that
only
such
variances
from
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
will
be
tolerated
as
cannot
be
avoided.
since
the
reapportionment
cases,
the
lower
courts
have
gone
in
two
directions.
one
group
has
taken
its
obligation
seriously
and
has
attempted
to
determine
how
close
a
reapportionment
plan
can
come
to
meeting
exactly
the
reapportionment
standard.
that
is
that
each
vote
should
be
counted
equally.
they
have
compared
the
enacted
legislative
plan
with
the
one
suggested
as
the
best
possible
and
if
there
is
no
justification
for
the
variances
in
the
enacted
plan
they
have
judicially
crafted
it
or
it
enacted
a
better
plan.
another
group
has
taken
the
opposite
approach
to
see
how
far
the
legislature
can
deviate
for
maximum
equality
without
transgressing
constitutional
limitations.
this
group
accords
a
presumption
of
validity
to
the
act
of
an
invidiously
discriminatory
body.
if
this
court
is
going
to
allow
its
reapportionment
decisions
to
be
diluted
by
this
maximum
permissible
deviation
school
we
believe
it
will
have
entered
the
political
picket
and
come
out
with
nothing
but
a
thorn.
in
its
february
decision
this
year,
this
court
directed
that
a
valid
reapportionment
plan
should
be
made
effective
in
florida
for
the
1966
alleged
elections.
we
believe
that
the
legislature
and
the
district
court
fail
to
carry
out
this
mandate.
in
the
language
of
reynolds
and
simms
if
there
has
ever
been
a
case
in
which
the
legislature
has
failed
to
reapportion
according
to
federal
constitutional
requisites
after
having
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
do
so
and
therefore
judicial
relief
becomes
appropriate
this
is
that
case.
but
the
florida
legislature
does
not
meet
until
april
4th.
the
adoption
of
a
new
constitution
for
the
state
of
florida
it's
one
of
its
prime
announced
objectives
of
the
new
legislature.
we
submit
proper
judicial
relief
would
be
to
place
into
effect
appellant's
plan
where
the
maximum
deviation
is
less
than
3.5%
in
time
to
be
effective
for
the
1967
session
of
the
florida
legislature
and
before
the
adoption
of
a
new
constitution.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no.
that
relates
strictly
to
the
relief,
the
court
of
course
has
several
alternatives,
they
could
send
the
matter
back
to
the
district
court
for
purposes
of
providing
the
appropriate
relief
or
they
could
direct
that
the
legislature
itself
placed
into
effect
a
constitutional
plan
prior
to
the
meeting
of
the
1967
session.
but
we
think
that
it
would
clearly
be
within
the
court's
discretion
in
view
of
the
long
reapportionment
history
in
florida
and
legislatures
continued
refusal
to
avail
the
mandates
of
this
court
and
to
enact
the
constitutional
plan.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
place
this
plan
in
to
effect.
we
do
not
think
the
people
of
florida
should
be
denied
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature
any
longer
particularly
when
constitutional
revision
is
directly
on
the
rise.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
it
would
be
if
the
legislature
had
any
desire
to
so
do,
the
plan
which
we
submitted
to
the
court
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
and
the
legislature
did
not
even
consider
it,
never
even
got
to
commit
it.
but
it
would
be
certainly
be
perfectly
possible.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
point
raised
by
the
attorney
general
that
we
don't
have
standing
to
be
here.
i
must
confess
that
he
was
making
that
argument,
i
was
reminded
a
little
of
the
line
competes,
what
mad,
what
hot,
what
fevered
pursued
is
this.
i
think
clearly
that
by
virtue
of
the
plan
that
we
have
filed
in
shown
that
appellant
swann
has
the
right
to
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature.
under
our
plan,
the
appellant
would
be
much
more
accurately
represented
than
under
the
plan
adopted
by
the
legislature
and
the
attorney
general
makes
the
error
several
times
in
his
briefs
that
saying
the
date
is
adequately
represented
and
the
senate
date
is
underrepresented
in
the
legislative
plan
to
the
extent
of
5.9%.
i
think
the
important
point
to
that
made
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
that
is
that
every
other
intervener
who
has
attempted
to
intervene
in
these
proceedings
to
present
their
particular
underrepresentation
problems
has
been
denied,
leaved
to
intervene
on
the
ground
that
this
appellant
was
expressing
the
position
of
all
the
under
represented
voters
in
the
state
of
florida.
for
example,
senator
mchugh
from
jacksonville,
duval
county
which
is
badly
underrepresented
in
this
plan
is
sought
to
intervene
on
several
occasions
and
he
has
been
denied
his
right
to
intervene.
of
course
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
the
standing
to
sue
is
to
insure
that
there's
an
adversary
proceeding
or
a
case
or
a
controversy
and
i
think
that
has
clearly
been
met
here
and
i
think
that
without
question
that
we
do
have
standing
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
am
not
familiar
mr.
justice
white
with
the
details
of
the
wyoming
case
or
what
evidence
may
have
been
in
the
record
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
as
they
relate
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
there
may
have
been
some
justification
in
the
record
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
don't
think
that
that
particular
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i
think
that
those
situations
may
not
be
comparable
situations
with
the
florida
situation.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
i'm
not
familiar
of
what
evidence
may
have
been
in
the
record
in
each
of
those
cases
but
i
think
in
the
plan
before
us
there
is
clearly
no
indication
or
no
explanation
anywhere
in
the
attorney
general
has
still
not
told
us
of
the
reason
for
these
variances
except
perhaps
to
suggest
that
there
are
political
reasons.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
was
correct
in
burns
versus
richardson,
the
court
very
clearly
said
that
there
must
be
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
variances
and
there
was
an
opportunity
in
a
hearing
held
and
i
read
from
the
record
at
page
88,
judge
jones
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
that
is
in
the
record
of
the
florida
case
filed
in
this
proceeding,
the
very
last
hearing
held
on
this
particular
plan
at
page
88,
judge
jones
says,
“is
there
any
other
evidence
to
be
introduced
to
this
hearing?”
“mr.
faircloth:
“the
state
has
none
your
honor
except
the
exhibit
house
bill
17x.”
i
submit
that's
commendable
candor
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
because
there
isn't
any
evidence
to
explain
and
there
can't
be
any
to
explain
why
these
wide
variances
exist
in
this
particular
plan.
they
are
there
as
i
said
is
pure
unvarnished
ad
hoc
litigation
of
these
legislators
who
think
the
seats
belong
to
them
instead
of
the
people
that
rejected
them.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
is
to
the
number
of
plans
submitted
in
response
to
the
court's
request.
there
are
at
least
10
plans
submitted
in
response
to
the
court's
request
coming
very
close
or
as
close
as
the
plan
submitted
by
appellants,
submitted
by
political
science
departments,
submitted
by
interested
citizens,
submitted
by
state
legislators
who
have
been
in
the
minority
in
the
state
legislature.
the
appellant's
plan
was
a
jointly
submitted
plan
submitted
by
dade
county
by
judge
swann,
by
the
league
of
women
voters
and
by
the
government
research
counsel
which
is
a
citizen's
--
independent
citizens
pacific
group
in
dade
county.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
there
have
been
four
plans
submitted
by
the
legislature.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
this
is
the
fourth
plan.
the
first
plan
was
rejected
overwhelmingly
by
vote
of
the
people
of
florida
in
the
legislature
have
never
permitted
the
people
to
vote
again
on
the
reapportionment
plan.
there
is
a
chance
that
anyone
of
these
plans
that
the
legislature
has
adopted
could
ever
be
accepted
by
vote
of
the
people
in
the
state.
that
second
--
then
the
legislature
came
along
the
adopted
a
second
plan
without
a
vote.
in
that
plan,
14%
of
the
people
in
the
state
elected
the
senate
and
29%
of
the
people
in
the
state
elected
the
house.
this
was
after
the
--
this
supreme
court's
decision.
the
legislature
then
came
along
in
9th
june
of
1965
which
was
also
after
this
supreme
court's
decision
and
again
after
the
criteria,
the
attorney
general
passed
out
a
similar
set
of
criteria
to
that
session
of
the
legislature
and
that
plan
was
so
bad
that
even
our
district
court
held
that
one
unconstitutional.
and
now,
they
come
with
the
fourth
plan
which
we
submit
is
also
unconstitutional.
we
submit
--
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
no,
not
for
a
hearing
mr.
justice
brennan
but
for
the
necessity
of
evidence
being
in
the
record
to
sustain
any
variances
or
deviations
that
there
maybe
in
the
plan.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
he
were,
that
case
deal
is
primarily
with
multi
member
districts
but
i
think
the
rule
would
still
be
same.
mr.
d.
p.
s.
paul
as
the
attorney
general
has
said,
unless
you
are
going
to
chisel
a
rule
in
stone
and
send
it
on
a
stone
tablet
to
the
florida
legislature
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
proper
reapportionment
plan.
we
submit
that
this
is
clearly
a
case
which
begs
for
judicial
relief
and
in
time
for
opening
of
the
florida
legislative
session
in
april
of
1967
and
before
this
malapportioned
legislature
attempts
to
tinker
with
the
basic
law
of
our
state
and
submit
a
new
constitution.
