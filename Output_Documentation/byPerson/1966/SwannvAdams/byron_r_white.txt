justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
not
asking
this
court,
are
you?
the
--
or
are
your
claiming
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
court
could
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
mean
that
there
is
at
least
one
county
which
is
that
30%
more
population
than
the
mean
county
or
than
the
average?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
so
it's
maximum
30%
variation
between
the
districts.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
now
this
is
--
this
is
not
the
variation
from
the
north?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
because
of
the
comparison
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ratio
between
the
largest
and
smallest?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
looked
in
those
cases
to
see
if
the
states
afford
to
justify
the
variances?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
so
per
curiam
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
does
florida
have
any
explanation
at
all
for
these
variances
or
do
you
think
there
should
just
be
a
rule
affirmed
that
as
long
as
the
variances
are
greater
than
x,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
well
are
you
--
i
maybe
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
should
--
you
don't
think
that
within
the
15%
(inaudible)
that
you
suggest
that
we
should
assume
the
constitutionality
of
the
apportionment
plan,
given
that
--
given
to
them
instead
of
a
presumption
that
there
was
a
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
far
as
the
evidence
of
this
case
to
go
that
--
that
these
variances
are
not
discriminatory.
we
aren't
going
to
act
on
a
presumption
that
there
was
a
reason
--
that
there
has
to
be
a
reason,
we
have
to
presume
a
reason
in
this
case
if
it's
going
to
be
sustained,
i
suppose.
there's
no
--
i
don't
see
any
--
is
the
record
--
it's
printed
here
as
we
got
any
information
of
the
difference
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest?
justice
byron
r.
white
must
there
--
most
of
your
reasons,
you
got
them
it
would
be
purely
political
compromised
reasons,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
there
wouldn't
be
because
of
the
county
boundary
or
because
of
the
distinctive
character
of
this
county
as
compared
to
another
it
would
be
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
would
be
a
confrontation
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
political
power,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
claim
now
stands
in
the
--
was
approved
as
a
permanent
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
paul,
what's
your
explanation
for
the
affirmance
on
the
wyoming
percentage?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
coming
up
here,
you're
urging
that
these
variations,
they're
unconstitutionally
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
what's
your
explanation
to
the
affirmance
that
the
senate
plan
in
wyoming?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
have
been
that
you
--
would
you
have
any
answer
for
citing
harrison
against
schaefer
against
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
(inaudible)
against
davis
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
the
opinion
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
richard
swann
against
tom
adams,
secretary
of
state
of
florida.
on
march
19,
1966
state
of
florida
reapportioned
the
state
legislature.
the
new
plan
called
the
48
senators
and
117
representatives.
senate
districts
range
in
size
from
87,000
to
114,000,
or
from
15%
over
the
average
and
10%
into
the
average
with
a
ratio
of
1.3:1
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
district.
the
deviation
from
average
is
over
15%
in
one
district,
14%
in
five
others,
and
more
than
10%
and
still
6
six
others,
the
variation
is
among
else
districts
are
somewhat
more
severe.
the
district
court
without
articulating
any
reasons
for
the
variations
to
this
magnitude
approved
the
plan.
we
reverse
while
reynolds
and
sims
and
other
cases
in
the
reapportionment
area
have
recognized
that
legislative
districts
need
not
be
mathematically
equal
in
population,
and
that
minor
variations
are
acceptable.
none
of
these
cases
has
approved
variations
of
the
magnitude
involved
in
this
case,
at
least
without
acceptable
justification.
here
neither
the
state
nor
the
district
court
made
any
serious
efforts
to
explain
or
justify
the
particular
deviations
which
this
reapportionment
plan
presents.
we
therefore
reverse
without
reaching
any
of
the
other
objections
which
the
appellants
have
presented
to
the
plan.
mr.
justice
harlan
has
asked
me
to
announce
that
he
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.

joined.
