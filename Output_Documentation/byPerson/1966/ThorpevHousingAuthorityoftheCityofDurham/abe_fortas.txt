justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
mr.
nabrit,
but
do
you
mean
--
do
you
think
there
ought
to
be
a
impartial
hearing
officer
in
one
of
these
situations?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
wouldn't
insist
on
any
inappropriate
procedures.
we're
just
trying
to
find
out
is
what
is
your
conception
of
an
inappropriate
decision
here?
but
you
have
to
have
a
transcript
suppose
they
want
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel
and
they
have
the
right
to
counsel.
and
suppose
they
can't
afford
a
counsel,
that
they
have
to
have
a
counsel
appointed
for
them.
as
to
what
the
problem
is
right
here,
i
take
it
that
you
don't
think
that
the
conference
technique
would
be
adequate
even
if
there
were
an
opportunity
given
to
the
tenant
to
present
his
views.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
am
not
suggesting.
i
am
asking
if
that
is
your
view.
i
don't
want
you
to

justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
this
case,
mr.
nabrit,
is
more
or
less
insofar
as
i'm
concerned,
as
i
understand
that
there
is
--
as
case
now
stands,
there
is
no
allegation
of
improper
motive
other
than,
that
the
allegation
that
she
was
evicted
because
she
was
head
of
the
housing
authority
tenants'
organization
and
that
was
found
against
her
by
the
courts
below,
is
that
right?
and
she
makes
no
--
no
allegation
other
than
that
of
improper
motive.
so
that
what
we
have
really
is
the
naked
question
of
whether
the
authority
has
to
give
notice
of
its
failure
to
renew
a
month
to
month
tenancy.
there
was
a
month-to-month
tenancy.
justice
abe
fortas
and
she
doesn't
allege
that
there
was
any
improper
motive,
does
she?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
been
--
that's
been
decided
again
and
again.
justice
abe
fortas
when
there
was
this
stipulation
was
entered
into
and
the
only
thing
the
stipulation
says
on
the
subject
is
that
the
executive
director
would
call
you
and
he
say
that
she
was
not
--
or
the
lease
was
terminated,
not
because
she
was
elected
president,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
stipulation
just
to
the
effect
that
other
people
have
called
and
would
testify
that
that
was
the
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
stipulation
that
would
indicate
there's
any
evidence
to
support
her
charge
that
she
was
--
that
her
tenancy
was
terminated
for
this
reason,
this
bad
reason,
allegedly
bad
reason.
