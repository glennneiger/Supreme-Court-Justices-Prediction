justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
there's
no
question
that
the
regulation
is
now
in
effect.
your
client
is
still
in
possession
of
the
premises?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
vacated
the
judgment
or
remanded
it
or
further
action
in
the
light
of
the
current
regulation
why
she
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
regulation,
wouldn't
she?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
a
finding
of
the
court
below
as
to
--
as
to
why
she
was
not
evicted?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
and
that
you've
been
interrupted
a
great
deal,
but
my
--
my
basis
to
tell
you
is
she
has
a
--
she
was
on
these
premises
under
an
agreement
which
very
explicitly
gave
either
--
either
party
a
right
to
terminate
on
15
days
notice
without
any
--
without
any
cost
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
agreement
says.
that's
what
the
contract
says
that
she
signed
and
that's
what
makes
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
a
part
of
the
--
the
part
of
the
contract
i
was
talking
about
and
i
suppose
you
are
too
is
the
part
that
it's
in
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
12
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
i
was
referring
to
as
i've
said,
the
last
full
paragraph
on
page
12
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
tenant
on
the
same
term?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
on
page
27
on
the
record.
it
seems
as
i
read
it,
to
fully
accept
and
to
confirm
the
trial
court's
finding
that
i'm
calling
whatever
may
have
been
the
plaintiff's
reason
for
terminating
the
lease.
it
was
neither
that
the
defendant
had
engaged
in
efforts
to
organize
the
tenants
mcdougald
terrace
nor
that
she
was
elected
president
of
a
group
which
was
organized
in
the
building
terrace
on
the
10th
of
august
1965.
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
misunderstand
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wasn't
she
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
find
out
in
the
usual
ways
familiar
to
us
that
is
by
confrontation
and
cross-examination
and
an
opportunity
to
bring
witnesses
there
to
determine
what
the
reason
was?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that,
but
i
--
i
thought
that
the
--
that
the
trial
court
in
this
case
did
not
agree
with
what
you
just
conceded
in
answer
to
justice
fortas'
question.
that
was
the
theory
of
the
trial
court
that
the
landlord
here
could
give
this
notice
on
any
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
on
any
reason
whatsoever;
and
therefore,
was
disposed
to
--
to
listen
to
any
reasons
or
lack
of
reasons,
because
of
its
theory
that
there
didn't
have
to
be
a
reason

this
could
be
any
reason.
justice

well,
in
any

there's
no

that
the

your

and
if

why
she
would
get
the

wouldn't
she?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
a
finding
of
the

below
as

as
to
why
she
was
not
