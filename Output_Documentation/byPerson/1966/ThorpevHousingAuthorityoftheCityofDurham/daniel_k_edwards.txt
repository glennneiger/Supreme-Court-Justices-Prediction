mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
in
answer
to
something
mr.
justice
douglas
asked,
this
is
certainly
not
a
first
amendment
case.whatever
it
is,
it's
not
that.
this
issue
having
been
decided,
there
was
a
contention
about
the
first
amendment
rights,
but
that
the
issue
was
decided
by
the
trial
court.
the
juror
and
was
waived
by
both
parties
and
has
agreed
that
the
judge
is
to
decide
the
facts.
the
petitioner
at
that
stage
of
the
game
was
not
prevented
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
any
reason
that
she
could
think
of
for
her
eviction.
she
had
available
to
her
discovery
procedure
--
procedures
under
state
courts
to
find
out
if
she
want
to
do
at
that
stage,
what
the
reasons
or
advantage.
he
did
not
ask
to
use
any
of
those
and
--
and
confine
themselves
to
this
allegation
that
she
was
evicted
because
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
assemble.
and
then
at
the
same
time
said
she
didn't
know
the
reason
because
they
wouldn't
tell
the
reason,
and
somewhat
contradictory
is
true,
but
the
facts
were
found
against
her
and
the
significant
thing
is
that
she
was
not
precluded
by
the
trial
court
from
asserting
any
constitutional
right
that
she
might
have
felt
had
been
violated
in
that
term.
and
so
this
case
then,
i
think,
presents
the
question
has
been
suggested
that
can
the
government
in
any
level,
whether
it
is
the
local
or
state
or
national
inject
funds
and
money,
public
money
into
a
housing
program
without
at
the
same
time
being
required
by
the
constitution
to
abandon
the
ordinary
and
normal
rules
governing
landlord
and
tenant
that
are
applicable
throughout
the
land.
in
other
words,
all
those
normal
procedures
of
leasing
and
of
renting
are
so
or
at
least
so
unusual
and
outlandish
as
to
--
as
to
be
unconstitutional
when
the
government
has
used
its
physical
powers
to
promote
a
housing
project
or
any
sort
of
housing
program
in
the
nation.
i'd
like
to,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
essence
of
this
case,
is
this
lease
which
is
not
an
unusual
lease,
it's
a
30-day
lease
which
is
automatically
renewable
unless
a
15-day
notice
is
given
to
terminate.
is
that
an
inviolate
instrument?
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
right.
it
says
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i
think
that's
not
quite
accurate,
sir,
because
on
the
--
in
the
supreme
court,
that
--
that
issue
was
not
pressed.
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
was
the
exception
on
the
trial
court's
finding
of
fact,
to
the
trial
court's
finding
of
fact.
but
when
it
got
into
the
supreme
court,
that
issue
was
not
argued
that
there
was
no
evidence
from
which
the
trial
of
fact
could
have
found
that
and
that
finding
of
fact
then
was
sustained
by
evidence,
competent
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
that
therefore
it
was
--
it
was
abstained.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes.
that
--
that
language
is
somewhat
bothersome
in
the
--
in
the
per
curiam
decision
of
north
carolina
supreme
court.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
that
language
by
itself
would
raise
a
constitutional
issue
since
you
have
to
read
that,
i
take
it,
against
the
background
of
the
finding
of
fact
that
this
particular
constitutional
issue
that
was
asserted
by
the
petitioner
was
not
in
fact
there
and
that
that
being
so,
it
was
immaterial
what
the
reasons
might
have
been.
you
have
a
distinction
and
i
think
between
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
the
--
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
you
can't
accept
that
this
is
true,
except
for
the
fact
that
was
normal
rules
of
--
of
procedure
are,
to
the
effect,
that
when
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
based
on
competent
evidence,
it's
not
normal
that
that
finding
of
fact
shall
be
overturned
by
the
appellate
court
for
only
the
issues
of
lower
rate.
and
so
the
trier
of
fact
here,
did
have
evidence
upon
which
it
could
have
found
that
to
be
the
fact.
and
then
when
the
issue
goes
forward
the
--
they
don't
raise
here
the
--
the
issue
certainly,
that
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
making
that
finding
of
fact
because
there
was
evidence
by
way
of
the
stipulation
that
--
that
would
permit
and
justify
that
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court.
and
now,
they
do
make
the
point
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
by
some
of
its
language
might
--
his
opinion
might
be
construed
as
saying
that
the
trial
court
did
not
have
to
make
that
finding
of
fact.
that
the
case
could
have
been
decided
even
without
the
finding
of
fact
being
made,
but
that
does
--
that's
not
a
necessary
construction
of
what
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
said,
and
we
say
that
it
should
not
be
so
construed.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
they
confirmed
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
below.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
did.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
the
statement
of
the
facts
here
as
before
they
get
into
their
opinion.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
correct.
the
--
the
supreme
court
included
in
its
--
in
the
factual
background
are
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and
we
say
that
that
means
that
--
that
is
having
been
found
by
the
court
below
as
a
fact
that
the
first
--
that
the
constitutional
violation
she
asserted
were
not
in
fact
ajusted,
then
it
was
immaterial.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
a
troublesome
language,
but
i
think
that
when
you
--
if
you
show
in
light
of
the
record
before
that
it
does
make
sense
and
that's
not
in
itself
a
violation
of
the
due
process.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
the
facts
stipulated
were
to
the
effect
that
the
executive
director,
if
he
were
present
and
testifying,
would
testify
that
this
was
not
the
reason.
they
did
not
--
they
did
not
stipulate
that
this
was
not
the
reason.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
none,
except
that
i
believe
she
introduced
an
affidavit
which
she
asserted
that
that
was
her
belief,
that
that
was
the
reason
that
she
was
evicted,
but
there
was
no
third
party
testimony,
no
witnesses,
no
--
nobody
else
other
than
the
petitioner
herself
who
asserted
that
that
was
her
belief
that
it
was
--
that
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
none.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
she
would
have
a
remedy
in
court
if
she
were
evicted
for
any
reason
that
would
infringe
on
any
of
our
constitutional
rights.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
had
such
a
hearing
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
--
and
before
the
justice
(inaudible).
the
owner
complained
they
have
about
the
adequacy
of
the
hearing
is
that
they
would
--
that
--
that
the
petitioner
would
desire
a
hearing
by
the
--
maybe
the
executive
directors,
maybe
the
housing
authority
commission.
we
don't
know
exactly
whom
before
going
into
court
and
then
instituting
an
action
of
ejectment.
there
is
no
legislative
machinery
set
up
whereby
the
housing
authority
can
conduct
any
such
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
exactly
our
point.
the
trial
court
did
not
rule
that
way.
the
trial
court,
if
it
had
ruled
that
way,
would
have
deemed
inadmissible
any
evidence
on
that
point.
it
--
it
did
not.
it
admitted
the
--
that
was
included
in
the
stipulation,
that
was
a
point
that
was
raised
and
the
trial
court,
all
it
did
was
to
--
to
not
ignore
it,
but
to
find
as
a
fact
that
it
wasn't
true.
now,
if
the
trial
court
had
deemed
it
immaterial,
it
would
have
been
inadmissible.
the
trial
court
would
not
have
to
go
into
a
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
not
true.
they
would
just
say
that
--
they
would
have
said
that
is
not
material,
that's
not
relevant
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
that
the
trial
court
did
not
do,
and
that's
the
main
point
here.
the
trial
court
said
that
is
relevant
and
i
am
finding
as
a
fact
that
it
isn't
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
he
didn't
tell
her
that,
but
she
said
that's
what
it
is.
and
when
it
had
gotten
as
far
as
the
trial
court
was
concerned,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
whether
she
said,
“that
is
the
reason
he
told
me
it
was,”
or
whether
she
said,
“that
is
the
reason
i
think
it
is.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that
that
would
not
affect
this
case
at
all.
i
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
exactly
say
that
i'm
here
and
i
do
not
represent
hud,
i
do
not
represent
the
public
housing
administration.
i
represent
the
housing
authority
of
the
city
of
durham.
we
think
this
is
a
little
case
and
in
that
context
i
represent
the
commissioners
there,
the
bar
of
commission
of
the
citizen
for
the
city
of
durham.
i
represent
no
federal
agency,
whatsoever.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is
not
a
regulation.
it's
--
i
think
it
is
more
or
less
of
an
advisory
sort
of
thing.
and
for
these
reasons,
and
i
am
--
and
i'm
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
say
something
about
that;
as
far
as
its
applicability
that
this
case
is
concerned,
whatever
it
is,
a
directive
or
a
recommendation
it
is
ex
post
facto,
as
far
as
this
--
and
the
relationship
between
the
housing
authority
that
i
represent
down
there
in
the
city
of
durham,
north
carolina
and
all
of
the
federal
agencies
is
by
contract
entered
into
by
that
housing
authority
which
is
organized
under
the
state
law,
and
they
enter
into
a
written
contract
with
all
of
the
federal
agencies
which
sets
forth
what
its
obligations
are
to
these
federal
agencies.
and
one
of
the
clauses
in
that
contract
is
not
that
they
shall
obey
any
directive
issued
by
the
federal
agency.
it
doesn't
say
that.
so
we
--
whatever
we
are
governed
by
is
by
contract
and
our
contract
with
--
with
the
folks
that
issued
this
directive
doesn't
say
that
we
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
it,
in
the
first
place.
and
in
the
second
place,
so
that
i
gather,
it's
in
effect
to
say
to
us
there
is
no
use
in
sending
it
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
directive,
regulation,
whatever
you'd
call
it
because
it's
not
binding
on
--
on
a
landlord.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
for
several
reasons,
one
--
one,
that
the
tenant
she
was
taking
advantage
of
such
a
directive
that
these
are
likely
the
third-party
beneficiary
of
a
contract.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
it's
not
a
part
of
the
lease,
then
become
a
part
of
the
lease
by
their
issuance
of
the
thing.
and
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
pertinent
here
is
that
in
1961,
the
congress,
in
the
housing
act
of
1961
as
part
of
that
act
said,
“the
public
housing
agency”
and
that
language
means
these
local
housing
authorities
like
the
one
i
represent“
shall
adopt
and
promulgate
regulations
establishing
admission
policies
which
shall
give
full
considerations
to
its
responsibility
for
the
rehousing
of
those
displaced
by
urban
renewal
or
other
governmental
action
to
the
applicant
status
of
servicemen
or
veteran
or
relationship
to
the
serviceman
or
veteran
or
disabled
serviceman
or
veteran
and
to
the
applicant's
age
or
disability
and
housing
conditions
related
to
the
housing
needs
and
sources
of
income.”
now,
that
by
law,
places
on
my
vote,
that
that
little
--
that
that
the
housing
authority
in
durham,
that
responsibility
and
it
is
not
the
federal
agency's
responsibility
by
law
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
can
think
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
ordinary
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
that
they
--
they
could
refuse
to
answer
on
a
discovery
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
the
reason
she
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
it
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i'd
say
i
do
think
it
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
do,
yes.
and
--
and
let
me
--
let
me
point
it
out
this
way.
this
may
sound
silly,
to
--
to
quibble
over
a
reason
or
not
a
reason,
but
there's
a
case
not
cited
in
either
briefs
--
in
the
brief
here
called
vitarelli
v.
seaton
at
359
u.s.
535
which
didn't
involve
necessarily
a
constitutional
issue,
but
that
the
secretary
of
interior
fired
an
employee.
he
fired
--
he
fired
the
employee
assigning
a
reason
and
say,
“you
are
a
security
risk.”
and
then
under
the
procedures
of
the
department
upon
firing
him
for
a
reason,
you
had
to
have
a
hearing,
and
it
did
have
a
hearing
and
there
was
not
enough
evidence.
but
the
court
there
took
the
position
that
if
you
fired
him
for
no
reason,
which
the
secretary
had
the
right
to
do,
you
didn't
have
to
have
such
a
hearing.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
governs
the
--
the
lease.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
--
that's
correct.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
it
has
certain
--
in
the
contract
between
the
housing
authority
and
pha,
in
the
old
contract,
it
says
that.
“you
shall
lease
these
apartments
to
people
and
your
lease
shall
conform
to
the
provisions
of
this
contract
and
to
all
the
pertinent
federal
statutes.”
but
it
does
not
further
prescribe
what
the
form
of
the
lease
shall
be,
and
the
lease
here
is
in
the
usual
form
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
agree
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
she
has
a
constitutional
right
to
ask
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
she
is.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sorry?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
if
she
asked
the
question
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
it
might
have
been
ruled
irrelevant.
but
i
think
the
discovery
procedures
available
to
her
when
the
case
is
in
the
superior
court
and
before
it
gets
to
trial,
give
her
the
full
right
to
explore
all
of
these
possibilities.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
in
spite
--
i
may
be
entirely
wrong.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
i
think
she
--
i
think
it
comes
down
to
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
--
that
she
be
told
a
reason
beforehand.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
any
--
i
don't
--
i
think
that
whatever
our
conference
was
before
the
trial
would
limit
her
when
she
went
into
the
discovery
procedures
that
she
might
say,
“no,
that
is
the
reason,
they
told
me,
isn't
the
real
reason.”
i'm
sure
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
upon
whom
is
the
burden
of
saying
why
she
was
--
she
was
evicted.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
can
by
--
by
going
in
the
court
and
doing
it.
that's
why
i'm
saying,
is
that
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
no
machinery
set
up
for
any
hearing
before
she
gets
into
the
trial
of
the
case
except
the
discovery
proceedings
which
set
up
under
the
statutes.
and
she
has
those
available
to
what
she
had
here.
and
what's
more,
in
this
particular
case,
which
we
say
stands
and
falls
on
the
record
here,
is
that
asserted
what
she
said
the
reason
was.
and
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
she
was
allowed
to
present
what
she
contended
the
reason
was,
and
of
any
evidence
she
wanted.
she
filed
an
affidavit
based
on
that,
and
that
was
her
--
her
contention
and
her
allegation
and
that
was
found
as
a
fact
against
her.
i
see
here
that
she
wanted
the
--
the
burden
being
upon
her
to
show
that
there
was
some
unconstitutional
reason
presented,
that
was
the
one
she
gave
and
the
facts
were
found
against
her.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
--
we
do.
there
are
--
there
are
state
cases
which
are
--
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
some
cases
on
--
on
page
9
of
the
brief
that
have
to
do
with
instances
just
of
this
sort
where
all
that
appears
was
that
the
tenant
was
given
a
notice
to
--
that
the
lease
would
terminate,
it
would
not
be
renewed
without
and
all,
without
any
other
reason
being
given
for
the
eviction,
and
that
reason
was
held
to
be
sufficient
about
those
state
course.
now,
it's
been
universally
held
that
where
a
reason
was
given
and
that
that
reason
was
an
unconstitutional
reason,
then
the
eviction
wouldn't
stand.
but
it's
also
been
held
universally
wherever
the
question
has
arisen
that
where
there's
no
reason
given,
then
there
was
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
--
the
notice
that
they're
going
to
terminate
the
lease
contain
some
reason.
and
if
you
did
give
a
reason,
who
then
is
to
decide
whether
the
reason
is
a
good
one
or
not,
the
sufficiency
of
the
reason?
and
just
as
the
--
the
distinctions
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
vitarelli
versus
seaton
to
the
effect
that
if
you
didn't
give
any
reason
at
all,
then
you
had
a
right
to
--
to
eliminate
the
employee.
but
if
you
did
give
a
reason,
then
you
had
to
have
a
hearing
on
it
and
had
to
take
evidence
on
both
sides.
so,
what
we
say
here
is
that
we
had
a
lease
that
was
not
arbitrary
and
not
out
of
line
with
leases
generally
in
use,
among
landlords
and
tenants,
that
we
have
here
a
court
proceeding
that
was
in
no
way
arbitrary,
and
that
she
had
full
opportunity
during
the
court
proceeding
to
present
evidence
on
any
issue
of
constitutionality
that
she
saw
fit
to
present
it
on,
that
she
did
in
fact
do
so,
that
issue
or
fact
was
decided
against
her,
and
therefore
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
left
in
this
case
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
some
that
are
sort
of
sponsored,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
budget,
as
i
recall
it,
that
--
that
puts
on
a
recreational
program
or
educational
program.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there
are
some
areas
of
recreation
encouraged
by
the
housing
authority,
but
it
is
basically
a
--
a
landlord
kind
of
situation,
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
my
opinion,
it's
not
binding
upon
us.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
get
federal
funds.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they're
under
--
we
get
the
federal
funds
under
an
instrument
called
the
annual
contributions
contract
which
we
have
entered
into
with
the
federal
government
or
its
agencies.
and
that
contract
sets
forth
the
terms
and
conditions
whereby
we
get
the
federal
money
to
contribute
to
this
operation
of
this
project.
and
that
contract
was
written
some
years
ago.
this
regulation
--
the
contract
itself
between
us
and
the
federal
government
doesn't
say
that
any
directive
issued
by
the
federal
government
will
become
incorporated
in
the
contract,
it
doesn't
say
that.
therefore,
we
say
that
the
--
that
the
contract
is
not
amended
by
this
directive
and
that
it's
being
ex
post
facto
is
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
know
if
there
is.
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
as
long
--
as
long
as
we
obeyed
the
law
that
the
congress
passed
and
as
long
as
we
have
complied
with
the
terms
of
our
contract
with
the
federal
government,
i
don't
believe
they
could
possibly.
some
of
them,
there
are
great
many
facets
of
this
law
relating
to
this
subject
that
i
am
very
unfamiliar
with
and
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
fully.
but
i
am
not
familiar
with
anything.
i'm
sure
that
our
contract
doesn't
provide
any
assessment
at
all.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
certainly
sounds
like.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
who
am
i
to
say
as
--
as
to
what
the
law
is.
but
my
opinion
is
in
representing
the
local
housing
authority
i
would
contend
that
it
was
not.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
that
--
and
furthermore,
i
should
--
in
answer
to
that
query,
i
think
that
the
--
the
language
of
the
thing
refers
to
the
reason
for
eviction.
and
we
gave
her
the
reason
for
eviction,
which
was
that
her
lease
had
run
out,
that
her
lease
had
terminated,
had
expired,
and
that's
the
reason
she
was
--
the
basic
reason
she
was
evicted.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
that
--
there'd
be
the
same
situations
there
that
would
be
and
if
they
refused
her
application,
it's
because
of
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i
think
possibly
it
was
a
--
the
reason
for
the
eviction
was
that
she
stayed
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
may
be
a
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
automatically
renewed
unless
you
give
them
15
days
notice
in
advance
of
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
must
have
a
normal
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
this
is
a
very
unusual
case,
it's
not
that
there's
a
great
mass
of
them,
you
don't
--
you
don't
do
it
that
way.
it's
just
--
it's
just
that
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
requires
us
to
change
that
form
of
the
lease,
that's
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
unconstitutional
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
in
answer
to
something
mr.
justice
douglas
asked,
this
is
certainly
not
a
first
amendment
case.whatever
it
is,
it's
not
that.
this
issue
having
been
decided,
there
was
a
contention
about
the
first
amendment
rights,
but
that
the
issue
was
decided
by
the
trial
court.
the
juror
and
was
waived
by
both
parties
and
has
agreed
that
the
judge
is
to
decide
the
facts.
the
petitioner
at
that
stage
of
the
game
was
not
prevented
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
any
reason
that
she
could
think
of
for
her
eviction.
she
had
available
to
her
discovery
procedure
--
procedures
under
state
courts
to
find
out
if
she
want
to
do
at
that
stage,
what
the
reasons
or
advantage.
he
did
not
ask
to
use
any
of
those
and
--
and
confine
themselves
to
this
allegation
that
she
was
evicted
because
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
assemble.
and
then
at
the
same
time
said
she
didn't
know
the
reason
because
they
wouldn't
tell
the
reason,
and
somewhat
contradictory
is
true,
but
the
facts
were
found
against
her
and
the
significant
thing
is
that
she
was
not
precluded
by
the
trial
court
from
asserting
any
constitutional
right
that
she
might
have
felt
had
been
violated
in
that
term.
and
so
this
case
then,
i
think,
presents
the
question
has
been
suggested
that
can
the
government
in
any
level,
whether
it
is
the
local
or
state
or
national
inject
funds
and
money,
public
money
into
a
housing
program
without
at
the
same
time
being
required
by
the
constitution
to
abandon
the
ordinary
and
normal
rules
governing
landlord
and
tenant
that
are
applicable
throughout
the
land.
in
other
words,
all
those
normal
procedures
of
leasing
and
of
renting
are
so
or
at
least
so
unusual
and
outlandish
as
to
--
as
to
be
unconstitutional
when
the
government
has
used
its
physical
powers
to
promote
a
housing
project
or
any
sort
of
housing
program
in
the
nation.
i'd
like
to,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
essence
of
this
case,
is
this
lease
which
is
not
an
unusual
lease,
it's
a
30-day
lease
which
is
automatically
renewable
unless
a
15-day
notice
is
given
to
terminate.
is
that
an
inviolate
instrument?
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
right.
it
says
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i
think
that's
not
quite
accurate,
sir,
because
on
the
--
in
the
supreme
court,
that
--
that
issue
was
not
pressed.
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
was
the
exception
on
the
trial
court's
finding
of
fact,
to
the
trial
court's
finding
of
fact.
but
when
it
got
into
the
supreme
court,
that
issue
was
not
argued
that
there
was
no
evidence
from
which
the
trial
of
fact
could
have
found
that
and
that
finding
of
fact
then
was
sustained
by
evidence,
competent
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
that
therefore
it
was
--
it
was
abstained.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes.
that
--
that
language
is
somewhat
bothersome
in
the
--
in
the
per
curiam
decision
of
north
carolina
supreme
court.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
that
language
by
itself
would
raise
a
constitutional
issue
since
you
have
to
read
that,
i
take
it,
against
the
background
of
the
finding
of
fact
that
this
particular
constitutional
issue
that
was
asserted
by
the
petitioner
was
not
in
fact
there
and
that
that
being
so,
it
was
immaterial
what
the
reasons
might
have
been.
you
have
a
distinction
and
i
think
between
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
the
--
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
you
can't
accept
that
this
is
true,
except
for
the
fact
that
was
normal
rules
of
--
of
procedure
are,
to
the
effect,
that
when
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
based
on
competent
evidence,
it's
not
normal
that
that
finding
of
fact
shall
be
overturned
by
the
appellate
court
for
only
the
issues
of
lower
rate.
and
so
the
trier
of
fact
here,
did
have
evidence
upon
which
it
could
have
found
that
to
be
the
fact.
and
then
when
the
issue
goes
forward
the
--
they
don't
raise
here
the
--
the
issue
certainly,
that
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
making
that
finding
of
fact
because
there
was
evidence
by
way
of
the
stipulation
that
--
that
would
permit
and
justify
that
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court.
and
now,
they
do
make
the
point
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
by
some
of
its
language
might
--
his
opinion
might
be
construed
as
saying
that
the
trial
court
did
not
have
to
make
that
finding
of
fact.
that
the
case
could
have
been
decided
even
without
the
finding
of
fact
being
made,
but
that
does
--
that's
not
a
necessary
construction
of
what
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
said,
and
we
say
that
it
should
not
be
so
construed.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
they
confirmed
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
below.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
did.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
the
statement
of
the
facts
here
as
before
they
get
into
their
opinion.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
correct.
the
--
the
supreme
court
included
in
its
--
in
the
factual
background
are
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and
we
say
that
that
means
that
--
that
is
having
been
found
by
the
court
below
as
a
fact
that
the
first
--
that
the
constitutional
violation
she
asserted
were
not
in
fact
ajusted,
then
it
was
immaterial.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
a
troublesome
language,
but
i
think
that
when
you
--
if
you
show
in
light
of
the
record
before
that
it
does
make
sense
and
that's
not
in
itself
a
violation
of
the
due
process.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
the
facts
stipulated
were
to
the
effect
that
the
executive
director,
if
he
were
present
and
testifying,
would
testify
that
this
was
not
the
reason.
they
did
not
--
they
did
not
stipulate
that
this
was
not
the
reason.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
none,
except
that
i
believe
she
introduced
an
affidavit
which
she
asserted
that
that
was
her
belief,
that
that
was
the
reason
that
she
was
evicted,
but
there
was
no
third
party
testimony,
no
witnesses,
no
--
nobody
else
other
than
the
petitioner
herself
who
asserted
that
that
was
her
belief
that
it
was
--
that
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
none.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
she
would
have
a
remedy
in
court
if
she
were
evicted
for
any
reason
that
would
infringe
on
any
of
our
constitutional
rights.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
had
such
a
hearing
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
--
and
before
the
justice
(inaudible).
the
owner
complained
they
have
about
the
adequacy
of
the
hearing
is
that
they
would
--
that
--
that
the
petitioner
would
desire
a
hearing
by
the
--
maybe
the
executive
directors,
maybe
the
housing
authority
commission.
we
don't
know
exactly
whom
before
going
into
court
and
then
instituting
an
action
of
ejectment.
there
is
no
legislative
machinery
set
up
whereby
the
housing
authority
can
conduct
any
such
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
exactly
our
point.
the
trial
court
did
not
rule
that
way.
the
trial
court,
if
it
had
ruled
that
way,
would
have
deemed
inadmissible
any
evidence
on
that
point.
it
--
it
did
not.
it
admitted
the
--
that
was
included
in
the
stipulation,
that
was
a
point
that
was
raised
and
the
trial
court,
all
it
did
was
to
--
to
not
ignore
it,
but
to
find
as
a
fact
that
it
wasn't
true.
now,
if
the
trial
court
had
deemed
it
immaterial,
it
would
have
been
inadmissible.
the
trial
court
would
not
have
to
go
into
a
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
not
true.
they
would
just
say
that
--
they
would
have
said
that
is
not
material,
that's
not
relevant
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
that
the
trial
court
did
not
do,
and
that's
the
main
point
here.
the
trial
court
said
that
is
relevant
and
i
am
finding
as
a
fact
that
it
isn't
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
he
didn't
tell
her
that,
but
she
said
that's
what
it
is.
and
when
it
had
gotten
as
far
as
the
trial
court
was
concerned,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
whether
she
said,
“that
is
the
reason
he
told
me
it
was,”
or
whether
she
said,
“that
is
the
reason
i
think
it
is.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that
that
would
not
affect
this
case
at
all.
i
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
exactly
say
that
i'm
here
and
i
do
not
represent
hud,
i
do
not
represent
the
public
housing
administration.
i
represent
the
housing
authority
of
the
city
of
durham.
we
think
this
is
a
little
case
and
in
that
context
i
represent
the
commissioners
there,
the
bar
of
commission
of
the
citizen
for
the
city
of
durham.
i
represent
no
federal
agency,
whatsoever.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is
not
a
regulation.
it's
--
i
think
it
is
more
or
less
of
an
advisory
sort
of
thing.
and
for
these
reasons,
and
i
am
--
and
i'm
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
say
something
about
that;
as
far
as
its
applicability
that
this
case
is
concerned,
whatever
it
is,
a
directive
or
a
recommendation
it
is
ex
post
facto,
as
far
as
this
--
and
the
relationship
between
the
housing
authority
that
i
represent
down
there
in
the
city
of
durham,
north
carolina
and
all
of
the
federal
agencies
is
by
contract
entered
into
by
that
housing
authority
which
is
organized
under
the
state
law,
and
they
enter
into
a
written
contract
with
all
of
the
federal
agencies
which
sets
forth
what
its
obligations
are
to
these
federal
agencies.
and
one
of
the
clauses
in
that
contract
is
not
that
they
shall
obey
any
directive
issued
by
the
federal
agency.
it
doesn't
say
that.
so
we
--
whatever
we
are
governed
by
is
by
contract
and
our
contract
with
--
with
the
folks
that
issued
this
directive
doesn't
say
that
we
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
it,
in
the
first
place.
and
in
the
second
place,
so
that
i
gather,
it's
in
effect
to
say
to
us
there
is
no
use
in
sending
it
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
directive,
regulation,
whatever
you'd
call
it
because
it's
not
binding
on
--
on
a
landlord.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
for
several
reasons,
one
--
one,
that
the
tenant
she
was
taking
advantage
of
such
a
directive
that
these
are
likely
the
third-party
beneficiary
of
a
contract.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
it's
not
a
part
of
the
lease,
then
become
a
part
of
the
lease
by
their
issuance
of
the
thing.
and
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
pertinent
here
is
that
in
1961,
the
congress,
in
the
housing
act
of
1961
as
part
of
that
act
said,
“the
public
housing
agency”
and
that
language
means
these
local
housing
authorities
like
the
one
i
represent“
shall
adopt
and
promulgate
regulations
establishing
admission
policies
which
shall
give
full
considerations
to
its
responsibility
for
the
rehousing
of
those
displaced
by
urban
renewal
or
other
governmental
action
to
the
applicant
status
of
servicemen
or
veteran
or
relationship
to
the
serviceman
or
veteran
or
disabled
serviceman
or
veteran
and
to
the
applicant's
age
or
disability
and
housing
conditions
related
to
the
housing
needs
and
sources
of
income.”
now,
that
by
law,
places
on
my
vote,
that
that
little
--
that
that
the
housing
authority
in
durham,
that
responsibility
and
it
is
not
the
federal
agency's
responsibility
by
law
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
can
think
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
ordinary
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
that
they
--
they
could
refuse
to
answer
on
a
discovery
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
the
reason
she
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
it
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i'd
say
i
do
think
it
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
do,
yes.
and
--
and
let
me
--
let
me
point
it
out
this
way.
this
may
sound
silly,
to
--
to
quibble
over
a
reason
or
not
a
reason,
but
there's
a
case
not
cited
in
either
briefs
--
in
the
brief
here
called
vitarelli
v.
seaton
at
359
u.s.
535
which
didn't
involve
necessarily
a
constitutional
issue,
but
that
the
secretary
of
interior
fired
an
employee.
he
fired
--
he
fired
the
employee
assigning
a
reason
and
say,
“you
are
a
security
risk.”
and
then
under
the
procedures
of
the
department
upon
firing
him
for
a
reason,
you
had
to
have
a
hearing,
and
it
did
have
a
hearing
and
there
was
not
enough
evidence.
but
the
court
there
took
the
position
that
if
you
fired
him
for
no
reason,
which
the
secretary
had
the
right
to
do,
you
didn't
have
to
have
such
a
hearing.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
governs
the
--
the
lease.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
--
that's
correct.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
it
has
certain
--
in
the
contract
between
the
housing
authority
and
pha,
in
the
old
contract,
it
says
that.
“you
shall
lease
these
apartments
to
people
and
your
lease
shall
conform
to
the
provisions
of
this
contract
and
to
all
the
pertinent
federal
statutes.”
but
it
does
not
further
prescribe
what
the
form
of
the
lease
shall
be,
and
the
lease
here
is
in
the
usual
form
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
agree
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
she
has
a
constitutional
right
to
ask
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
she
is.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sorry?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
if
she
asked
the
question
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
it
might
have
been
ruled
irrelevant.
but
i
think
the
discovery
procedures
available
to
her
when
the
case
is
in
the
superior
court
and
before
it
gets
to
trial,
give
her
the
full
right
to
explore
all
of
these
possibilities.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
in
spite
--
i
may
be
entirely
wrong.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
i
think
she
--
i
think
it
comes
down
to
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
--
that
she
be
told
a
reason
beforehand.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
any
--
i
don't
--
i
think
that
whatever
our
conference
was
before
the
trial
would
limit
her
when
she
went
into
the
discovery
procedures
that
she
might
say,
“no,
that
is
the
reason,
they
told
me,
isn't
the
real
reason.”
i'm
sure
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
upon
whom
is
the
burden
of
saying
why
she
was
--
she
was
evicted.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
can
by
--
by
going
in
the
court
and
doing
it.
that's
why
i'm
saying,
is
that
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
no
machinery
set
up
for
any
hearing
before
she
gets
into
the
trial
of
the
case
except
the
discovery
proceedings
which
set
up
under
the
statutes.
and
she
has
those
available
to
what
she
had
here.
and
what's
more,
in
this
particular
case,
which
we
say
stands
and
falls
on
the
record
here,
is
that
asserted
what
she
said
the
reason
was.
and
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
she
was
allowed
to
present
what
she
contended
the
reason
was,
and
of
any
evidence
she
wanted.
she
filed
an
affidavit
based
on
that,
and
that
was
her
--
her
contention
and
her
allegation
and
that
was
found
as
a
fact
against
her.
i
see
here
that
she
wanted
the
--
the
burden
being
upon
her
to
show
that
there
was
some
unconstitutional
reason
presented,
that
was
the
one
she
gave
and
the
facts
were
found
against
her.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
--
we
do.
there
are
--
there
are
state
cases
which
are
--
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
some
cases
on
--
on
page
9
of
the
brief
that
have
to
do
with
instances
just
of
this
sort
where
all
that
appears
was
that
the
tenant
was
given
a
notice
to
--
that
the
lease
would
terminate,
it
would
not
be
renewed
without
and
all,
without
any
other
reason
being
given
for
the
eviction,
and
that
reason
was
held
to
be
sufficient
about
those
state
course.
now,
it's
been
universally
held
that
where
a
reason
was
given
and
that
that
reason
was
an
unconstitutional
reason,
then
the
eviction
wouldn't
stand.
but
it's
also
been
held
universally
wherever
the
question
has
arisen
that
where
there's
no
reason
given,
then
there
was
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
--
the
notice
that
they're
going
to
terminate
the
lease
contain
some
reason.
and
if
you
did
give
a
reason,
who
then
is
to
decide
whether
the
reason
is
a
good
one
or
not,
the
sufficiency
of
the
reason?
and
just
as
the
--
the
distinctions
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
vitarelli
versus
seaton
to
the
effect
that
if
you
didn't
give
any
reason
at
all,
then
you
had
a
right
to
--
to
eliminate
the
employee.
but
if
you
did
give
a
reason,
then
you
had
to
have
a
hearing
on
it
and
had
to
take
evidence
on
both
sides.
so,
what
we
say
here
is
that
we
had
a
lease
that
was
not
arbitrary
and
not
out
of
line
with
leases
generally
in
use,
among
landlords
and
tenants,
that
we
have
here
a
court
proceeding
that
was
in
no
way
arbitrary,
and
that
she
had
full
opportunity
during
the
court
proceeding
to
present
evidence
on
any
issue
of
constitutionality
that
she
saw
fit
to
present
it
on,
that
she
did
in
fact
do
so,
that
issue
or
fact
was
decided
against
her,
and
therefore
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
left
in
this
case
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
some
that
are
sort
of
sponsored,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
budget,
as
i
recall
it,
that
--
that
puts
on
a
recreational
program
or
educational
program.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there
are
some
areas
of
recreation
encouraged
by
the
housing
authority,
but
it
is
basically
a
--
a
landlord
kind
of
situation,
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
my
opinion,
it's
not
binding
upon
us.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
get
federal
funds.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they're
under
--
we
get
the
federal
funds
under
an
instrument
called
the
annual
contributions
contract
which
we
have
entered
into
with
the
federal
government
or
its
agencies.
and
that
contract
sets
forth
the
terms
and
conditions
whereby
we
get
the
federal
money
to
contribute
to
this
operation
of
this
project.
and
that
contract
was
written
some
years
ago.
this
regulation
--
the
contract
itself
between
us
and
the
federal
government
doesn't
say
that
any
directive
issued
by
the
federal
government
will
become
incorporated
in
the
contract,
it
doesn't
say
that.
therefore,
we
say
that
the
--
that
the
contract
is
not
amended
by
this
directive
and
that
it's
being
ex
post
facto
is
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
know
if
there
is.
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
as
long
--
as
long
as
we
obeyed
the
law
that
the
congress
passed
and
as
long
as
we
have
complied
with
the
terms
of
our
contract
with
the
federal
government,
i
don't
believe
they
could
possibly.
some
of
them,
there
are
great
many
facets
of
this
law
relating
to
this
subject
that
i
am
very
unfamiliar
with
and
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
fully.
but
i
am
not
familiar
with
anything.
i'm
sure
that
our
contract
doesn't
provide
any
assessment
at
all.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
certainly
sounds
like.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
who
am
i
to
say
as
--
as
to
what
the
law
is.
but
my
opinion
is
in
representing
the
local
housing
authority
i
would
contend
that
it
was
not.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
that
--
and
furthermore,
i
should
--
in
answer
to
that
query,
i
think
that
the
--
the
language
of
the
thing
refers
to
the
reason
for
eviction.
and
we
gave
her
the
reason
for
eviction,
which
was
that
her
lease
had
run
out,
that
her
lease
had
terminated,
had
expired,
and
that's
the
reason
she
was
--
the
basic
reason
she
was
evicted.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
that
--
there'd
be
the
same
situations
there
that
would
be
and
if
they
refused
her
application,
it's
because
of
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
--
i
think
possibly
it
was
a
--
the
reason
for
the
eviction
was
that
she
stayed
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
may
be
a
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
automatically
renewed
unless
you
give
them
15
days
notice
in
advance
of
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
must
have
a
normal
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
this
is
a
very
unusual
case,
it's
not
that
there's
a
great
mass
of
them,
you
don't
--
you
don't
do
it
that
way.
it's
just
--
it's
just
that
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
requires
us
to
change
that
form
of
the
lease,
that's
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
unconstitutional
and
that's
our
position.
