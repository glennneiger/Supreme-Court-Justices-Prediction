unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
in
violation
of
the
eye
witness
that
they
can't
give
a
good
reason,
they
can't
evict
her?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
may
i
--
may
i
get
myself
straight?
unknown
speaker
to
see
her
exception,
number
one
on
page
25,
challenges
the
trial
court's
findings
that
she
was
not
evicted
because
of
her
first
amendment
right.
unknown
speaker
she
--
she
takes
that
up
to
the
court,
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court,
unless
i
missed
something,
doesn't
reset
saying
that
any
reason
is
a
good
reason
under
this
context.
unknown
speaker
it
is
exception
number
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
referring
to
the
opinion
on
page
28
as
this
is
immaterial
of
what
may
have
been
the
reason
for
the
lessor's
unwillingness
to
continue
the
relationship
with
the
landlord
and
tenant.
unknown
speaker
but
that
decision
---
that's
revising
the
record
that
we
have
or
supplementing
it
because
you
can't
tell
that
from
this
record,
but
you
say,
that
it
was
waived.
unknown
speaker
her
exception
number
one
was
waived.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
this
record,
but
what's
the
reason
for
the
break
on
page
28
and
then
you
get
another
heading
per
curiam?
were
there
two
opinions
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
--
what
is
the
explanation?
do
you
know
what
i'm
referring?
unknown
speaker
do
you
see,
what
justice
stewart
read
is
followed
by
a
paragraph
that
says
upon
these
findings
the
court
concluded.
do
i
get
that
the
--
what
justice
stewart
read
was
the
finding
of
the
lower
court
and
the
recitation
by
the
supreme
court
of
its
finding.
unknown
speaker
so
far
as
material
here
on
page
28,
it
says,
it
is
immaterial
of
what
may
have
been
the
reason
for
the
lessor's
unwillingness
to
continue
with
the
relationship
with
landlord
and
tenant.
unknown
speaker
i'd
like
to
say
it's
troublesome.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
facts
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
if
she
were
evicted
for
this
reason,
for
the
reason
that
she
claims,
do
you
agree
that
she
would
have
had
a
remedy
in
court?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
edwards,
now
that
you
have
the
regulation
which
requires
whatever
form
that
the
procedure
takes
that
a
reason
be
stated.
is
it
your
view
that
if
a
reason
were
stated,
if
that
rule
had
been
effective
when
this
all
arose,
and
the
reason
actually
stated
by
the
project
manager
was,
“i'm
evicting
you
because”
as
she
alleges
she'd
organized
this
group
or
as
the
case
may
be.
then
in
the
--
nevertheless,
he
evicted
her
or
attempted
to,
with
this
proceeding
and
before
the
justice
proceed.
is
it
your
view
that
in
that
circumstance
the
validity
of
that
reason
would
be
relevant
to
the
right
of
the
eviction?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
may
i
get
back
then
to
your
new
regulation?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
does
that
contemplate?
unknown
speaker
if
we
may
lay
that
aside.
i
just
wanted
what
that
regulation
contemplated.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
now
required,
i
gather,
to
comply
with
that
regulation,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
not,
and
this
is
a
regulation
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
whatever
you
may
call
it,
it's
not
part
of
the
lease
though?
unknown
speaker
mr.
--
mr.
edwards,
could
i
ask
you
--
you
say
that
the
reason
that
the
authority
has
for
evicting
may
be
a
bad
one,
may
be
one
that
would
bar
--
i
think
you
can
think
of
reasons.
unknown
speaker
or
for
the
very
matter
that
was
alleged
here.
the
tenant
gets
sued
could
be
evicted
and
order
--
and
she's
already
evicted
because
she
appealed
to
the
superior
court
for
the
trial
de
novo,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
an
ordinary
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
would
you
suggest
that
in
an
ordinary
lawsuit
where
there
may
be
a
bad
reason
for
eviction
and
you
want
to
find
out
whether
that
bad
reason
exists
or
not,
that
the
authority
could
refuse
in
that
suit
to
answer
why
was
this
lady
evicted?
unknown
speaker
well
what
--
well
then,
what's
all
these
fuss
about
that
the
trial
court
says
you
don't
need
to
give
a
reason
for
it?
but
at
some
point,
wouldn't
you
concede
that
the
lady
is
entitled
to
find
out
why
she
was
evicted?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
--
let's
just
assume
that
i
suppose
she's
got
a
right
to
call
the
housing
authorities
and
that's
the
first
witness
under
the
procedure,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
she
ask?
would
that
be
an
irrelevant
question
on
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
--
why
it
--
why
hasn't
she
done
at
some
point
got
the
right
to
find
out
why
she
was
evicted?
unknown
speaker
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
law
do
you
think
governs
this
lease?
unknown
speaker
is
this
something
--
is
this
form
prescribed
by
--
by
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
and
--
and
the
housing
authority
is
free
to
adopt
and
form
at
once?
unknown
speaker
but
i
still
don't
understand
why
in
an
--
in
an
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court
why
this
lady
alleges,
“i
was
--
i
was
evicted
for
a
certain
reason.”
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
agree
that
if
she
can
prove
that,
the
eviction
will
not
stand?
unknown
speaker
and
then
--
the
truth,
the
--
and
she
did
not
prove
it,
according
to
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
but
i
would
think
as
part
of
her
proof
of
that,
at
least,
she
should
be
able
to
ask
you,
“why
did
you
--
why
did
you
evict
me?”
or,
“why
have
you
ordered
me
evicted?”
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
speaking
about
if
it's
constitutional
--
the
constitutional
right.
i'm
just
asking
if
that
--
whether
the
ordinary
law
of
evidence,
rule
of
evidence
she
is
entitled
to
--
to
ask
that
question
and
have
it
answered?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
then
i
thought
you
it
was
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
it
was
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
i
would
be
surprised
if
she
couldn't
answer
--
ask
a
question
and
have
it
answered.
unknown
speaker
but
assuming
for
the
moment
that
she
could
ask
and
get
this
information,
then
the
case
comes
down
to
--
then
--
then
--
that
she
could
really
find
out
why
would
--
why
she
was
evicted.
then
the
case
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
she
has
the
constitutional
right
to
know
beforehand.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
--
let's
--
do
you
think
--
let's
assume
that
this
regulation,
that
this
so-called
regulation
or
this
directive
has
come
out
now,
would
you
say
you're
not
bound
by
this?
let's
assume
you
were,
but
let's
also
assume
that
it's
part
of
the
lease,
that
this
is
a
regulation
that
means
that
you
must
give
her
a
reason.
does
this
add
anything,
really,
to
what
she
could
find
out
at
the
trial
assuming
she
would
find
out?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
as
to
her
due
process,
that
she
has
a
due
process
hearing
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
and
if
--
if
she
could
find
out
why
she
was
evicted?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
burden
is
on
her,
but
in
the
process
of
making
her
case,
of
proving
her
case,
you
should
be
able
to
find
out
and
knew
why
she
was
--
unknown
speaker
did
she
ever
ask
anybody
during
the
--
in
the
trial
of
this
lawsuit?
was
there
any
effort
to
find
out
why
she
--
why
she
was
evicted?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trial
court
said
that
--
the
trial
court
--
there
was
no
duty
upon
the
plaintiff
to
give
to
the
defendant
any
reason
for
its
termination
of
the
lease
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
to
hold
any
hearing
order.
that
may
be
literally
true,
but
it's
also
--
you
could
read
that
a
little
more
broadly
in
saying
that
she's
not
entitled
even
to
find
out
now.
unknown
speaker
have
there
have
been
some
cases
around
the
country
on
the
laws
governing
housing
authorities?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
that
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
--
what
is
the
legal
effect?
(inaudible)
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
this
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
get
federal
funds?
unknown
speaker
you
obtain
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
federal
government
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
provision
that
after
the
so-called
directive
or
regulation,
“in
addition
to
informing
the
tenant
of
the
reasons
for
any
proposed
eviction
action;
from
this
date,
each
local
authority
shall
maintain
a
written
record
of
every
eviction
from
a
federally
assisted
public
housing.
such
records
are
to
be
available
for
review
from
time
to
time
by
hud
representatives
and
shall
contain
the
following
information”
and
then
they
have
the
name
of
the
tenant,
date
of
the
notice,
and
three
specific
reasons
for
notice
to
vacate.
now,
that's
certainly
couched
in
--
somehow,
whoever
wrote
it,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
thought
it
was
something
in
which
the
housing
authority
had
to
provide.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it's
not
the
law.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
it
really
does
--
that's
really
the
reason
then
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
don't
normally
--
unknown
speaker
leases
--
leases
run
out
every
month.
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
everybody
in
it?
so
everybody's
lease
runs
out
every
month?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
normally
evict
people
because
their
lease
runs
out.
unknown
speaker
that
you'd
normally
have
some
reason
for
not
renewing
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
in
violation
of
the
eye
witness
that
they
can't
give
a
good
reason,
they
can't
evict
her?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
may
i
--
may
i
get
myself
straight?
unknown
speaker
to
see
her
exception,
number
one
on
page
25,
challenges
the
trial
court's
findings
that
she
was
not
evicted
because
of
her
first
amendment
right.
unknown
speaker
she
--
she
takes
that
up
to
the
court,
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court,
unless
i
missed
something,
doesn't
reset
saying
that
any
reason
is
a
good
reason
under
this
context.
unknown
speaker
it
is
exception
number

i'm

unknown

her

number

was

unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
this
record,
but
what's
the
reason
for
the
break
on
page
28
and
then
you
get
another

were
there
two

proof
of
that,
at
least,
she
should
be
able
to
ask
you,
“why
did
you
--
why
did
you
evict
me?”
or,
“why
have
you
ordered
me
evicted?”
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
speaking
about
if
it's
constitutional
--
the
constitutional
right.
i'm
just
asking
if
that
--
whether
the
ordinary
law
of
evidence,
rule
of
evidence
she
is
entitled
to
--
to
ask
that
question
and
have
it
answered?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
then
i
thought
you
it
was
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
it
was
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
i
would
be
surprised
if
she
couldn't
answer
--
ask
a
question
and
have
it
answered.
unknown
speaker
but
assuming
for
the
moment
that
she
could
ask
and
get
this
information,
then
the
case
comes
down
to
--
then
--
then
--
that
she
could
really
find
out
why
would
--
why
she
was
evicted.
then
the
case
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
she
has
the
constitutional
right
to
know
beforehand.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
--
let's
--
do
you
think
--
let's
assume
that
this
regulation,
that
this
so-called
regulation
or
this
directive
has
come
out
now,
would
you
say
you're
not
bound
by
this?
let's
assume
you
were,
but
let's
also
assume
that
it's
part
of
the
lease,
that
this
is
a
regulation
that
means
that
you
must
give
her
a
reason.
does
this
add
anything,
really,
to
what
she
could
find
out
at
the
trial
assuming
she
would
find
out?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
as
to
her
due
process,
that
she
has
a
due
process
hearing
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
and
if
--
if
she
could
find
out
why
she
was
evicted?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
burden
is
on
her,
but
in
the
process
of
making
her
case,
of
proving
her
case,
you
should
be
able
to
find
out
and
knew
why
she
was
--
unknown
speaker
did
she
ever
ask
anybody
during
the
--
in
the
trial
of
this
lawsuit?
was
there
any
effort
to
find
out
why
she
--
why
she
was
evicted?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trial
court
said
that
--
the
trial
court
--
there
was
no
duty
upon
the
plaintiff
to
give
to
the
defendant
any
reason
for
its
termination
of
the
lease
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
to
hold
any
hearing
order.
that
may
be
literally
true,
but
it's
also
--
you
could
read
that
a
little
more
broadly
in
saying
that
she's
not
entitled
even
to
find
out
now.
unknown
speaker
have
there
have
been
some
cases
around
the
country
on
the
laws
governing
housing
authorities?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
that
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
--
what
is
the
legal
effect?
(inaudible)
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
this
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
get
federal
funds?
unknown
speaker
you
obtain
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
federal
government
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
provision
that
after
the
so-called
directive
or
regulation,
“in
addition
to
informing
the
tenant
of
the
reasons
for
any
proposed
eviction
action;
from
this
date,
each
local
authority
shall
maintain
a
written
record
of
every
eviction
from
a
federally
assisted
public
housing.
such
records
are
to
be
available
for
review
from
time
to
time
by
hud
representatives
and
shall
contain
the
following
information”
and
then
they
have
the
name
of
the
tenant,
date
of
the
notice,
and
three
specific
reasons
for
notice
to
vacate.
now,
that's
certainly
couched
in
--
somehow,
whoever
wrote
it,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
thought
it
was
something
in
which
the
housing
authority
had
to
provide.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it's
not
the
law.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
it
really
does
--
that's
really
the
reason
then
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
don't
normally
--
unknown
speaker
leases
--
leases
run
out
every
month.
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
everybody
in
it?
so
everybody's
lease
runs
out
every
month?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
normally
evict
people
because
their
lease
runs
out.
unknown
speaker
that
you'd
normally
have
some
reason
for
not
renewing
it.
