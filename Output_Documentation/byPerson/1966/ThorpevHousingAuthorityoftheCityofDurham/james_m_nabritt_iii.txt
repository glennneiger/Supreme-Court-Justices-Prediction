mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
likely,
the
case
that
had
just
been
concluded,
involves
the
housing
rights
of
the
disadvantaged
citizens
in
our
society.
however,
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
involves
no
issue
of
state
action.
it
is
conceded
that
the
respondent,
housing
authority
of
the
city
of
durham,
is
an
agency
of
the
state
operating
under
state
statutes
and
operating
a
low-income
public
housing
project
under
a
contract
with
the
united
states.
the
question
presented
here
is
also
not
one
directly
involving
any
racial
discrimination
claim,
but
rather
the
more
general
one
of
whether
a
public
housing
authority
may
terminate
a
tenant's
housing
benefits,
entirely
arbritrarily,
without
giving
any
reason,
without
being
accountable
at
all
for
what
it
does.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
your
honor's
question
relates
to
our
reply
brief
and
to
the
regulation
adopted
on
february
7th
after
our
briefs
were
filed
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development.
in
the
first
part
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
forth
an
argument
which
we
think,
would
support
the
decision
by
this
court,
reversing
the
decision
below
and
setting
aside
this
eviction
on
non-constitutional
ground.
however,
we
urge
that
the
court
consider
the
constitutional
questions
and
exercise
its
discretion
to
decide
them
for
several
important
reasons.
we
think
that
first,
it
is
vital
and
most
important
that
the
--
this
court
may
claim
that
the
rights
of
public
housing
tenants
under
the
--
are
protected
under
the
constitution
that
--
that
public
housing
tenants
have
rights
which
the
court
will
protect
and
which
the
public
housing
authority
must
respect.
it's
--
it's
no
accident,
i
think,
that
30
years
have
gone
by
since
this
federal
housing
program
was
first
adopted,
and
this
is
the
first
case
to
come
to
this
court
where
the
tenants
were
in
a
position
to
assert
rights
against
the
public
housing
authority.
and
that's
because
these
are
people
who
don't
have
the
money
to
litigate
cases
and
who
will
rarely
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
so
it's
most
important
that
if
their
constitutional
rights
are
going
to
be
protected,
they're
going
to
have
to
be
protected
by
the
administrative
agencies,
and
the
way
that
the
administrative
agencies
can
be
stimulated
to
act
is
through
a
judicial
decision,
that
february
7th
regulation
represents
that.
it
was
only
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
that
the
longstanding
policy
was
reversed
so
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
if
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
we
agree.
if,
and
it's
an
important
if,
the
new
regulation
is
construed
to
clarify
one
or
two
ambiguities
about
the
right
to
a
hearing.
i
had
intended
to
perhaps
it
would
be
worthwhile
at
this
time,
mr.
justice
harlan,
since
you
have
raised
the
issue,
if
i
discuss
this
new
regulation
in
some
--
in
some
detail.
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
your
honor,
we
argue
that
it's
--
in
part
on
the
language
of
the
regulation,
but
more
on
general
precedence
of
the
courts
that
this
regulation
can
be
applied
to
this
case
because
it's
a
pending
case
and
it's
not
final
since
it's
here
on
the
record
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
under
the
state.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
we
--
we
believe
that
the
--
the
trial
court
would
be
bound
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
recognize
as
a
defense
that
this
regulation,
which
is
the
one
dated
february
7,
1967
in
our
reply
brief
that
this
regulation
which
states
that.
“it's
essential
that
no
tenant
be
given
a
notice
to
vacate
without
being
told
--
being
told
by
the
local
authority
the
reasons
for
eviction.
that
--
that
a
local
court
would
have
to
honor
that
and
say
that
a
requirement
--
that
the
local
public
housing
authority
coming
into
court
in
violation
of
that
rule
couldn't
prevail.”
this
case
arose
now.
we
think
that
a
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
now
--
now,
we're
getting,
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
the
area
of
--
of
where
the,
certainly,
regulation
is
not
precise
and
specific.
for
example,
the
regulation
doesn't
use
the
word
hearing
at
all.
it
says
that
it
uses
the
term
“private
conference”
and
suggests
that
tenants
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
such
reply
or
explanation
as
he
may
wish.
now,
if
that
means
what
i
would
call
a
hearing,
that
is
a
rudimentary
due
process
proceeding
where
the
tenant
would
have
the
right
to
know
what
authority
was
placed
against
him
were,
where
he
would
have
some
sort
of
opportunity
to
probe
their
--
their
case,
to
find
out
what
facts
they
relied
on
and
to
--
and
to
challenge
them
with
his
own
version
of
the
facts,
if
he
contested,
assuming
he
contested
them,
and
would
--
and
would
have
the
right
to
have
an
impartial
decision,
and
to
know
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
process
what
ground
they
rely
on
for
their
decision
making.
and
i
think
the
circular
can
be
construed
by
this
court
to
require
it.
then
the
court
might
be
able
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
however,
i
think,
as
i
began
this
entire
discussion
by
saying
as
part
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
first
inquiry
that
we
think
it
important
that
the
court
in
these
circumstances
decide
the
--
the
constitutional
issue,
the
due
process
issue,
and
in
doing
so,
might
serve
some
of
the
same
policies
that
are
normally
served
by
avoiding
constitutional
questions.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
think
the
decision
should
not
be
made
by
authority
who
--
who
was
giving
--
giving
evidence
against
the
--
the
tenant.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yeah,
if
--
if
the
situation
was
that
the
--
that
the
tenant
claims
one
version
of
an
incident
or
event
and
the
project
manager
claims
another
version,
then
--
then
perhaps
the
director
of
the
authority,
it's
the
superior
authority
would
have
some
sort
of
hearing
officer.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
--
but
i
don't
insist
on
anymore
formality
than
is
--
than
is
appropriate
considering
the
circumstances
in
terms
of
rules
of
evidence,
and
that's
all.
i
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
insist,
for
example,
that
the
claimant,
that
the
claimant
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yeah
--
yeah
that
--
i
agree
with
that,
but
that
--
that
that
kind
of
non-adversary
conference
works
--
would
not
be
in
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
there
--
there
are
a
variety
of
questions
there.
first
on
the
--
on
the
right
to
be
represented,
it
would
seem
to
me,
fundamental,
that
the
tenant
would
have
the
right
to
bring
his
lawyer
or
other
personal
representative
and
then
have
a
lawyer
to
bring
his
family
and
friends
or
--
or
the
head
of
a
tenant
organization
or
poverty
program
worker
or
a
social
worker
to
come
and
help
state
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no,
because
the
entire
--
throughout
the
proceedings
the
authority
stood
on
its
right
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no.
no,
there
is
no
suggestion
of
--
of
that
or
any
other
reason.
it
was
just
that
the
--
the
authority
stands
on
a
proposition
that
it's
not
absolute.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
why
--
why
it
was
evicting
her.
she
alleged
she
was
being
--
that
she
believes
she
was
being
evicted
for
her
own
activities,
organizing
a
tenants'
organization.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
--
i
never
really
got
--
got
an
opportunity
to
--
to
state
the
case.
i
--
the
--
the
court
below
did
find
her
against
her
on
that
issue
on
a
--
on
a
basis
of
stipulations,
the
stipulated
testimony
which
is
in
the
--
in
the
record
at
a
page
7.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
executive
director
of
the
housing
authority,
if
you
would
call
him
to
testify,
would
have
said
that,
“whatever
reason
there
may
have
been,
if
any,
for
giving
notice
to
joyce
c.
thorpe
of
the
termination
of
her
lease”,
it
was
not
for
the
reason
that
she
was
elected
president,
(inaudible)
i
am
now
paraphrasing,
do
not
believe
that
she
was
like
the
president
of
the
tenant
group
or
trying
to
organize
the
tenants.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
this
re
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
douglas.
your
question
points
out
that
the
new
regulation
doesn't
say
to
the
housing
authority
that
your
reasons
for
acting
must
be
reasonable
and
they
must
not
be
arbitrary.
it
only
deals
with
the
--
with
the
procedural
side.
now,
i
did
not
want
to
get
too
far
away
with
that
in
terms.
it's
part
of
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
about
what
type
of
hearing
procedure
we
thought
was
fundamental.
i'd
--
i've
answered
it,
i
believe,
with
respect
to
the
right
to
bring
along
a
personal
representative.
i
think
the
right
to
have
some
sort
of
opportunity
to
put
in
4evidence
to
--
as
i
mentioned
to
you
that
word
the
tenant's
side
of
the
version
of
the
facts,
the
direct
supporting
witness
is
--
is
essential.
an
opportunity
to
know
what
the
facts
are
that
the
housing
authority
is
relying
on
for
its
--
to
keep
--
to
put
someone
out
of
a
project.
if
they
claim
that
she
is
--
that
--
that
a
tenant
is
engaged
in
misconduct,
she's
really
required
to
make
known
the
facts
on
which
they
--
they
purport
the
act
and
give
the
tenant
an
opportunity
to
disprove
it
and
to
challenge
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
our
--
i
--
i
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
the
bedrock
of
our
position
in
this
case
is
the
--
the
concept
expressed
in
just
a
few
lines
by
judge
edgerton
in
--
in
the
rudder
case.
they're
--
they're
quoted
in
our
brief
at
the
top
of
page
16,
and
the
--
the
language
is
this“the
government
as
landlord
is
still
the
government.
it
must
not
act
arbitrarily,
for,
unlike
private
landlords,
it
is
subject
to
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law
and
arbitrary
action
is
not
due
process.”
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
let
--
let
me
address
myself,
too.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
--
that
it's
only
the
--
it's
not
a
sufficient
answer.
so,
say
that
the
low-income
tenant
has
no
right
vis–à–vis
a
governmental
housing
agency
other
than
those
(inaudible)
by
a
contract
because
the
citizen
must
have
the
right
to
be
treated
fairly
by
--
by
the
governmental
agency
under
the
due
process
clause.
so
that,
i
think
an
inquiry
as
to
what
--
what
the
lease
says
doesn't
decide
the
constitutional
question.
but
--
but
in
one
form,
it
might
be
thought
of
as
raising
the
issue
of
waiver,
whether
or
not
the
--
whether
or
not
the
lease
waive
a
constitutional
right
to
--
to
a
fair
treatment.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
you
honor,
the
first
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment,
i'd
say.
it
seems
that
i
--
i
can't
say
enough
to
emphasize
the
--
the
potential
of
this
kind
of
arbitrary
power
in
suppressing
the
dissent.
there
are
2.3
million
americans
who
live
in
public
housing
projects,
half
of
them
are
negroes,
31%
are
elderly
people.
these
--
these
are
the
citizens
in
the
society
with
--
with
the
lowest
income
groups.
that
the
citizens
who
have
least
effective
voice
in
the
political
and
community
affairs.
it
seems
to
me
these
are
--
with
dealing
--
when
government
deals
with
this
group
of
citizens
for
it
to
exercise
total
--
or
a
claim
--
total
arbitrary
power
is
most
dangerous
in
the
society.
the
--
the
reported
cases
and
some
unreported
ones,
too,
in
the
housing
field
show
the
--
the
kind
of
abuses,
the
kind
of
arbitrary
things
that
--
that
can
occur.
judge
--
some
of
my
associates
are
involved
in
litigations
now
pending
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama
where
judge
grooms
entered
an
--
an
injunction
with
findings,
temporary
restraining
order
with
findings
against
the
housing
authority,
that
undertook
under
this
kind
of
arbitrary
power,
to
threaten
to
evict
the
tenant
because
the
tenant's
daughter
was
pregnant
and
unmarried,
even
though
the
daughter
didn't
even
live
in
the
project.
a
new
york
case
sanders
against
cruz
reports,
a
reported
case,
represents
how
the
housing
authority
threatened
to
evict
a
tenant
who
brought
a
civil
action
against
them
on
the
ground
that
a
tenant's
teenage
son
was
involved
in
narcotics
and
they
were
going
to
evict
the
tenant
even
though
for
a
year
before
this,
the
son
had
been
in
federal
hospital
in
lexington
or
wasn't
living
with
the
family
at
all.
so
those
are
examples
of
the
kind
of
--
of
arbitrary
power
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court?
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
the
lease
raised
by
mr.
stewart's
question
before
the
--
the
lunch
hour.
let
me
address
this
issue
in
this
way.
in
the
first
place,
the
lease
itself
doesn't
say
anything
one
way
or
another,
about
what
--
whether
or
not
the
authority
must
give
a
reason
for
terminating.
it's
silent
on
this.
in
the
second
place,
the
authority's
argument,
i
take
it,
concedes
that
they
can't
evict
for
a
specifically
unconstitutional
reason
such
as
in
order
to
infringe
free
religion
or
to
supress
speech.
i
take
it
that
they
concede
that
but
they
contend
that
they
can
evict
and
keep
silent
about
what
their
reason
is.
they
don't
suggest
that
they
have
any
--
anything
that
justifies
secrecy
in
terms
of,
you
know,
like
classified
information
or
security
interest.
they
assert
it
merely
as
the
right
not
to
--
to
be
required
to
say
why
they
are
acting.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
the
--
the
lease
actually
contains
four
or
five
different
provisions
for
termination.
each
one
has
a
different
time
length.
the
one
they
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
one
that
they
referred
to
in
the
notice
to
mrs.
thorpe
to
--
to
vacate.
the
lease
may
be
terminated
by
the
management
by
giving
15
days
notice
prior
to
the
end
of
the
term.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
there
is
nothing
in
--
well,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
nothing
in
there,
either
way,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
they
have
to
have
a
reason
or
whether
or
not
they
have
to
state
a
reason.
they
can
see
that
they
can
evict
under
that
provision
in
order
to
punish
someone
for
speech
or
to
violate
free
religion
or
to
influence
racial
segregation
or
discrimination.
they
--
they
can
see
that,
but
what
--
what
they
contend
is
that
they
do
not
have
to
tell
why
they
--
they
are
acting
and
it's
our
view
that
if
they
don't
have
to
tell,
they
can
obviously
act
for
a
forbidden
reason
and
that
they
are
immune
from
--
from
challenge
and
that
really,
their
assertion
is
the
claim,
directly
a
claim
to
--
to
arbitrary
power.
now,
and
i
began
earlier
by
talking
about
waiver.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
right
of
the
tenant
to
be
free
from
this
kind
of
arbitrary
power,
the
governmental
agency
can't
be
handing
out
benefits
in
this
kind
of
subsidy
program
for
low-income
people,
subsidized
houses.
government
agency
can't
require
them
to
waive
that
--
that
right
and
there
can't,
in
any
event,
be
a
waiver
of
it
unless
there
is
--
there
is
a
classic
waiver
in
the
johnson
and
(inaudible)
knowing
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege.
now,
what
--
what
interest
does
the
tenant
have
at
stake
in
protesting
against
arbitrary
power.
well,
at
first,
it's
obvious
on
the
--
on
the
face
of
the
--
the
findings
which
justify
the
housing
program,
the
findings
in
the
--
the
--
their
basic
enactments
that
---
that
the
tenant's
interest
is
an
interest
in
having
decent
and
safe
and
sanitary
housing,
and
that
he's
only
--
the
tenant
only
admitted,
only
found
eligible
to
get
in
the
project
in
the
first
place
if
there
is
a
scarcity
of
--
of
such
housing
and
if
the
tenant
cannot
afford
decent,
safe,
sanitary
housing
on
a
private
market.
that's
the
only
way
to
get
in,
in
the
first
place.
so,
that
to
evict
them,
arbitrarily,
is
automatically
to
--
to
remit
them
to
the
slums
and
that's
obviously
a
--
a
matter
of
great
consequence
in
--
in
the
life
of
a
family.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
it
is
automatically
renewable
as
long
as
the
rent's
paid
and
--
and
she
doesn't
violate
the
contract.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
she
does.
she
alleges
that
the
--
she
alleges
that
they
evicted
her
and
they
did
evict
her
the
day
after
she
was
elected
president
of
the
tenants'
organization.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
what
i
was
--
what
i
was
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
the
rule
which
makes
the
--
the
state
law
there
which
makes
the
reason
immaterial
prevents
her
from
effectively
litigating
any
first
amendment
claim
--
this
claim
because
if
--
if
the
authority
doesn't
have
to
give
a
reason,
there's
no
way
in
the
world
--
it's
an
issue
that's
unfathomable
if
--
if
they
can
stand
on
a
law
of
silence,
there's
no
way
she
can
litigate
the
claim
any
better
than
she
did
which
is
to
show
the
coincidence
of
events
and
she
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
i
would
think,
which
they
have
attempted
to
rebut
except
by
a
bold
denial
of
an
improper
motive
and
then
standing
on
their
right
to
claim
silence.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
reading
--
reading
the
stipulation,
the
stipulation,
i
think,
should
benefit
both
parties.
that
the
--
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
had
any
valid
reason.
he
said
his
--
the
curious
wording
of
it,
his
reason
is
if
i
have
any
reason
is
not
that
that
is
standing
on
his
right
to
sell.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
now,
the
--
the
agreement
at
trial
was
that
the
trial
judge
could
consider
two
things,
her
affidavit
and
the
stipulation
as
to
what
the
manager
would
testify.
it's
her
affidavit
that
--
and
the
court
made
findings
and
they
accord
with
--
with
the
allegations
in
her
affidavit
as
to
the
coincidence
of
time
and
--
and
the
event.
let
--
let
me
say
it
lastly,
that
i
don't
believe
the
authority
has
any
reasonable
claim
that
--
or
housing
authorities
generally
do
that
giving
a
fundamental
premise
is
unduly
burdensome.
that
the
largest
housing
authority
in
the
nation,
the
city
of
new
york
housing
authority
with
550,000
tenants
gives
hearings
as
the
tenant
board
gives
hearing.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
we
would
request,
your
honor,
a
judgment
reversing,
vacating
or
setting
aside
the
judgment
of
eviction
and
then
leaving
the
housing
authority
to
take
any
further
steps
(inaudible)
it
might
take.
i
would
hope
that
the
--
that
the
judgment
and
opinion
would
make
it
clear
that
the
housing
authority
is
bound
by
the
constitution
in
whatever
it
does
as
a
governmental
agency
and
can't
act
arbitrarily.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
--
that
--
i
don't
believe
you
can
infer
from
the
silence
of
congress
on
the
issue
of
eviction.
any
support
or
authorization
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
full
import
of
your
question
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
don't
think
congress
could
authorize
in
fact,
arbitrarily,
if
that
answers
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
think
that
there
are
limitations
on
the
power
of
the
congress
beyond
the
purely
procedural
ones
as
you
notice
it
here.
although
this
is
the
--
but
this
case
doesn't
present
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
given
particular
rule
adopted
by
a
state
agency
or
approved
by
the
congress
is
reasonable.
we
--
we
don't
have
here
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
rule
that,
for
example,
you
can't
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
--
you
can't
have
dogs
in
the
--
in
the
project
that
violates
due
process.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
question
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
well,
let
--
let
me
just
suggest
on
--
on
this
subject,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
we
are
in
the
kind
of
area
where
perhaps
the
normal
presumptions
of
the
validity
of
legislative
action,
the
--
the
normal
strength
of
that
doctrine
may
not
run
its
full
course
because
if
we
are
in
the
area
of
like
--
like
the
area
of
speech,
i
think,
or
like
the
area
referred
to
in
the
footnote
four
in
the
carolene
product's
case
where
--
where
these
are
under
previous
people
that
have
no
way
of
expression.
unless
the
courts
protect
them,
that
they
have
no
other
political
expression
or
political
structure.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
recognize
that
many
decisions
of
this
court
in
accord
with
--
with
that
notion,
that
is
particularly
the
--
in
the
economic
regulation
field
where
the
court
30
years
ago
or
i
suppose
shifted
course
and
indicated
it
would
not
interfere
with
--
with
legislative
experimentation
and
economic
regulation.
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
that
this
case
is
in
the
area
of
governmental
regulation
of
--
of
intimacies
and
the
privacies
of
people's
lives,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
this
--we
are
in
the
area
where
we're
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no,
i
--
i
don't
suggest
that
it'd
be
all
judicial,
but
i
suggest
there
are
some
limits
on.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
step
back
a
moment
and
--
and
suggest
that
these
questions
we
are
discussing
which
--
which
i
think
are
things
we
thought
about.
i'm
not
involved
in
--
in
this
case
involving
the
procedural
rights,
the
rights
to
--
to
know
why
the
government
is
acting
against
you
and
the
--
and
the
right
to
have
some
fair
--
fair
chance
to
meet
the
--
with
the
government's
case
when
it's
going
to
cut
off
its
subsidy
to
you.
so,
my
case
today
involves
the
procedural
claim,
but
if
the
court
has
some
--
i
--
i
understood
you
to
be
suggesting
--
we're
not
discussing
the
substitute
problems.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
exactly
understand
the
--
the
relation
of
the
jury
trial
issue
to
this
question
of
reviewing
administrative
regulation
not
directed
by
any
specific
statute.
it's
just
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
there
is
certainly
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
any
--
in
a
summary
ejectment
action
in
north
carolina.
the
party's
waived
it
in
this
case.
but
--
but
they
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
when
the
--
that
the
court
has
done
that
with
caution,
but
that
the
court
has
properly
done
that
and
--
and
probably
it
should
do
when
--
when
it
deals
with
cases
where
the
bureaucrat
is
making
the
rules
and
regulations
which
governs
the
--
the
privacy
of
a
citizen's
life
and
--
and
which
--
with
which
to
tell
the
citizen
how
he
must
live,
the
bureaucrat
operating
without
any
specific
legislative
guidance.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
suggest
(inaudible),
mr.
justice
black,
that
--
that
when
the
executive
officials
at
the
lower
level,
the
housing
project
manager
level
are
given
basically
unfair
to
discretion
to
--
about
the
decisions
which
really
matter
in
the
lives
of
these
--
of
--
of
poor
people
that
the
judicial
supervision
by
the
due
process
stand
has
to
come
in
play
that
--
that
some
--
that
--
to
get
bad
enough
so
that
everybody
would
agree
that's
arbitrary.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
has
settled
or
has
agreed
that
that
is
totally
arbitrary.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
that
is
totally
arbitrary,
racial
distinctions
by
government
are
--
are
forbidden.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
(inaudible)
we
don't
have
any
time,
to
talk
about.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
likely,
the
case
that
had
just
been
concluded,
involves
the
housing
rights
of
the
disadvantaged
citizens
in
our
society.
however,
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
involves
no
issue
of
state
action.
it
is
conceded
that
the
respondent,
housing
authority
of
the
city
of
durham,
is
an
agency
of
the
state
operating
under
state
statutes
and
operating
a
low-income
public
housing
project
under
a
contract
with
the
united
states.
the
question
presented
here
is
also
not
one
directly
involving
any
racial
discrimination
claim,
but
rather
the
more
general
one
of
whether
a
public
housing
authority
may
terminate
a
tenant's
housing
benefits,
entirely
arbritrarily,
without
giving
any
reason,
without
being
accountable
at
all
for
what
it
does.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
your
honor's
question
relates
to
our
reply
brief
and
to
the
regulation
adopted
on
february
7th
after
our
briefs
were
filed
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development.
in
the
first
part
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
forth
an
argument
which
we
think,
would
support
the
decision
by
this
court,
reversing
the
decision
below
and
setting
aside
this
eviction
on
non-constitutional
ground.
however,
we
urge
that
the
court
consider
the
constitutional
questions
and
exercise
its
discretion
to
decide
them
for
several
important
reasons.
we
think
that
first,
it
is
vital
and
most
important
that
the
--
this
court
may
claim
that
the
rights
of
public
housing
tenants
under
the
--
are
protected
under
the
constitution
that
--
that
public
housing
tenants
have
rights
which
the
court
will
protect
and
which
the
public
housing
authority
must
respect.
it's
--
it's
no
accident,
i
think,
that
30
years
have
gone
by
since
this
federal
housing
program
was
first
adopted,
and
this
is
the
first
case
to
come
to
this
court
where
the
tenants
were
in
a
position
to
assert
rights
against
the
public
housing
authority.
and
that's
because
these
are
people
who
don't
have
the
money
to
litigate
cases
and
who
will
rarely
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
so
it's
most
important
that
if
their
constitutional
rights
are
going
to
be
protected,
they're
going
to
have
to
be
protected
by
the
administrative
agencies,
and
the
way
that
the
administrative
agencies
can
be
stimulated
to
act
is
through
a
judicial
decision,
that
february
7th
regulation
represents
that.
it
was
only
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
that
the
longstanding
policy
was
reversed
so
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
if
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
we
agree.
if,
and
it's
an
important
if,
the
new
regulation
is
construed
to
clarify
one
or
two
ambiguities
about
the
right
to
a
hearing.
i
had
intended
to
perhaps
it
would
be
worthwhile
at
this
time,
mr.
justice
harlan,
since
you
have
raised
the
issue,
if
i
discuss
this
new
regulation
in
some
--
in
some
detail.
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
your
honor,
we
argue
that
it's
--
in
part
on
the
language
of
the
regulation,
but
more
on
general
precedence
of
the
courts
that
this
regulation
can
be
applied
to
this
case
because
it's
a
pending
case
and
it's
not
final
since
it's
here
on
the
record
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
under
the
state.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
we
--
we
believe
that
the
--
the
trial
court
would
be
bound
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
recognize
as
a
defense
that
this
regulation,
which
is
the
one
dated
february
7,
1967
in
our
reply
brief
that
this
regulation
which
states
that.
“it's
essential
that
no
tenant
be
given
a
notice
to
vacate
without
being
told
--
being
told
by
the
local
authority
the
reasons
for
eviction.
that
--
that
a
local
court
would
have
to
honor
that
and
say
that
a
requirement
--
that
the
local
public
housing
authority
coming
into
court
in
violation
of
that
rule
couldn't
prevail.”
this
case
arose
now.
we
think
that
a
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
now
--
now,
we're
getting,
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
the
area
of
--
of
where
the,
certainly,
regulation
is
not
precise
and
specific.
for
example,
the
regulation
doesn't
use
the
word
hearing
at
all.
it
says
that
it
uses
the
term
“private
conference”
and
suggests
that
tenants
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
such
reply
or
explanation
as
he
may
wish.
now,
if
that
means
what
i
would
call
a
hearing,
that
is
a
rudimentary
due
process
proceeding
where
the
tenant
would
have
the
right
to
know
what
authority
was
placed
against
him
were,
where
he
would
have
some
sort
of
opportunity
to
probe
their
--
their
case,
to
find
out
what
facts
they
relied
on
and
to
--
and
to
challenge
them
with
his
own
version
of
the
facts,
if
he
contested,
assuming
he
contested
them,
and
would
--
and
would
have
the
right
to
have
an
impartial
decision,
and
to
know
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
process
what
ground
they
rely
on
for
their
decision
making.
and
i
think
the
circular
can
be
construed
by
this
court
to
require
it.
then
the
court
might
be
able
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
however,
i
think,
as
i
began
this
entire
discussion
by
saying
as
part
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
first
inquiry
that
we
think
it
important
that
the
court
in
these
circumstances
decide
the
--
the
constitutional
issue,
the
due
process
issue,
and
in
doing
so,
might
serve
some
of
the
same
policies
that
are
normally
served
by
avoiding
constitutional
questions.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
think
the
decision
should
not
be
made
by
authority
who
--
who
was
giving
--
giving
evidence
against
the
--
the
tenant.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yeah,
if
--
if
the
situation
was
that
the
--
that
the
tenant
claims
one
version
of
an
incident
or
event
and
the
project
manager
claims
another
version,
then
--
then
perhaps
the
director
of
the
authority,
it's
the
superior
authority
would
have
some
sort
of
hearing
officer.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
--
but
i
don't
insist
on
anymore
formality
than
is
--
than
is
appropriate
considering
the
circumstances
in
terms
of
rules
of
evidence,
and
that's
all.
i
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
insist,
for
example,
that
the
claimant,
that
the
claimant
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yeah
--
yeah
that
--
i
agree
with
that,
but
that
--
that
that
kind
of
non-adversary
conference
works
--
would
not
be
in
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
there
--
there
are
a
variety
of
questions
there.
first
on
the
--
on
the
right
to
be
represented,
it
would
seem
to
me,
fundamental,
that
the
tenant
would
have
the
right
to
bring
his
lawyer
or
other
personal
representative
and
then
have
a
lawyer
to
bring
his
family
and
friends
or
--
or
the
head
of
a
tenant
organization
or
poverty
program
worker
or
a
social
worker
to
come
and
help
state
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no,
because
the
entire
--
throughout
the
proceedings
the
authority
stood
on
its
right
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no.
no,
there
is
no
suggestion
of
--
of
that
or
any
other
reason.
it
was
just
that
the
--
the
authority
stands
on
a
proposition
that
it's
not
absolute.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
why
--
why
it
was
evicting
her.
she
alleged
she
was
being
--
that
she
believes
she
was
being
evicted
for
her
own
activities,
organizing
a
tenants'
organization.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
--
i
never
really
got
--
got
an
opportunity
to
--
to
state
the
case.
i
--
the
--
the
court
below
did
find
her
against
her
on
that
issue
on
a
--
on
a
basis
of
stipulations,
the
stipulated
testimony
which
is
in
the
--
in
the
record
at
a
page
7.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
executive
director
of
the
housing
authority,
if
you
would
call
him
to
testify,
would
have
said
that,
“whatever
reason
there
may
have
been,
if
any,
for
giving
notice
to
joyce
c.
thorpe
of
the
termination
of
her
lease”,
it
was
not
for
the
reason
that
she
was
elected
president,
(inaudible)
i
am
now
paraphrasing,
do
not
believe
that
she
was
like
the
president
of
the
tenant
group
or
trying
to
organize
the
tenants.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
this
re
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
douglas.
your
question
points
out
that
the
new
regulation
doesn't
say
to
the
housing
authority
that
your
reasons
for
acting
must
be
reasonable
and
they
must
not
be
arbitrary.
it
only
deals
with
the
--
with
the
procedural
side.
now,
i
did
not
want
to
get
too
far
away
with
that
in
terms.
it's
part
of
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
about
what
type
of
hearing
procedure
we
thought
was
fundamental.
i'd
--
i've
answered
it,
i
believe,
with
respect
to
the
right
to
bring
along
a
personal
representative.
i
think
the
right
to
have
some
sort
of
opportunity
to
put
in
4evidence
to
--
as
i
mentioned
to
you
that
word
the
tenant's
side
of
the
version
of
the
facts,
the
direct
supporting
witness
is
--
is
essential.
an
opportunity
to
know
what
the
facts
are
that
the
housing
authority
is
relying
on
for
its
--
to
keep
--
to
put
someone
out
of
a
project.
if
they
claim
that
she
is
--
that
--
that
a
tenant
is
engaged
in
misconduct,
she's
really
required
to
make
known
the
facts
on
which
they
--
they
purport
the
act
and
give
the
tenant
an
opportunity
to
disprove
it
and
to
challenge
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
our
--
i
--
i
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
the
bedrock
of
our
position
in
this
case
is
the
--
the
concept
expressed
in
just
a
few
lines
by
judge
edgerton
in
--
in
the
rudder
case.
they're
--
they're
quoted
in
our
brief
at
the
top
of
page
16,
and
the
--
the
language
is
this“the
government
as
landlord
is
still
the
government.
it
must
not
act
arbitrarily,
for,
unlike
private
landlords,
it
is
subject
to
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law
and
arbitrary
action
is
not
due
process.”
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
let
--
let
me
address
myself,
too.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
--
that
it's
only
the
--
it's
not
a
sufficient
answer.
so,
say
that
the
low-income
tenant
has
no
right
vis–à–vis
a
governmental
housing
agency
other
than
those
(inaudible)
by
a
contract
because
the
citizen
must
have
the
right
to
be
treated
fairly
by
--
by
the
governmental
agency
under
the
due
process
clause.
so
that,
i
think
an
inquiry
as
to
what
--
what
the
lease
says
doesn't
decide
the
constitutional
question.
but
--
but
in
one
form,
it
might
be
thought
of
as
raising
the
issue
of
waiver,
whether
or
not
the
--
whether
or
not
the
lease
waive
a
constitutional
right
to
--
to
a
fair
treatment.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
you
honor,
the
first
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment,
i'd
say.
it
seems
that
i
--
i
can't
say
enough
to
emphasize
the
--
the
potential
of
this
kind
of
arbitrary
power
in
suppressing
the
dissent.
there
are
2.3
million
americans
who
live
in
public
housing
projects,
half
of
them
are
negroes,
31%
are
elderly
people.
these
--
these
are
the
citizens
in
the
society
with
--
with
the
lowest
income
groups.
that
the
citizens
who
have
least
effective
voice
in
the
political
and
community
affairs.
it
seems
to
me
these
are
--
with
dealing
--
when
government
deals
with
this
group
of
citizens
for
it
to
exercise
total
--
or
a
claim
--
total
arbitrary
power
is
most
dangerous
in
the
society.
the
--
the
reported
cases
and
some
unreported
ones,
too,
in
the
housing
field
show
the
--
the
kind
of
abuses,
the
kind
of
arbitrary
things
that
--
that
can
occur.
judge
--
some
of
my
associates
are
involved
in
litigations
now
pending
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama
where
judge
grooms
entered
an
--
an
injunction
with
findings,
temporary
restraining
order
with
findings
against
the
housing
authority,
that
undertook
under
this
kind
of
arbitrary
power,
to
threaten
to
evict
the
tenant
because
the
tenant's
daughter
was
pregnant
and
unmarried,
even
though
the
daughter
didn't
even
live
in
the
project.
a
new
york
case
sanders
against
cruz
reports,
a
reported
case,
represents
how
the
housing
authority
threatened
to
evict
a
tenant
who
brought
a
civil
action
against
them
on
the
ground
that
a
tenant's
teenage
son
was
involved
in
narcotics
and
they
were
going
to
evict
the
tenant
even
though
for
a
year
before
this,
the
son
had
been
in
federal
hospital
in
lexington
or
wasn't
living
with
the
family
at
all.
so
those
are
examples
of
the
kind
of
--
of
arbitrary
power
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court?
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
the
lease
raised
by
mr.
stewart's
question
before
the
--
the
lunch
hour.
let
me
address
this
issue
in
this
way.
in
the
first
place,
the
lease
itself
doesn't
say
anything
one
way
or
another,
about
what
--
whether
or
not
the
authority
must
give
a
reason
for
terminating.
it's
silent
on
this.
in
the
second
place,
the
authority's
argument,
i
take
it,
concedes
that
they
can't
evict
for
a
specifically
unconstitutional
reason
such
as
in
order
to
infringe
free
religion
or
to
supress
speech.
i
take
it
that
they
concede
that
but
they
contend
that
they
can
evict
and
keep
silent
about
what
their
reason
is.
they
don't
suggest
that
they
have
any
--
anything
that
justifies
secrecy
in
terms
of,
you
know,
like
classified
information
or
security
interest.
they
assert
it
merely
as
the
right
not
to
--
to
be
required
to
say
why
they
are
acting.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
the
--
the
lease
actually
contains
four
or
five
different
provisions
for
termination.
each
one
has
a
different
time
length.
the
one
they
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
one
that
they
referred
to
in
the
notice
to
mrs.
thorpe
to
--
to
vacate.
the
lease
may
be
terminated
by
the
management
by
giving
15
days
notice
prior
to
the
end
of
the
term.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
there
is
nothing
in
--
well,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
nothing
in
there,
either
way,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
they
have
to
have
a
reason
or
whether
or
not
they
have
to
state
a
reason.
they
can
see
that
they
can
evict
under
that
provision
in
order
to
punish
someone
for
speech
or
to
violate
free
religion
or
to
influence
racial
segregation
or
discrimination.
they
--
they
can
see
that,
but
what
--
what
they
contend
is
that
they
do
not
have
to
tell
why
they
--
they
are
acting
and
it's
our
view
that
if
they
don't
have
to
tell,
they
can
obviously
act
for
a
forbidden
reason
and
that
they
are
immune
from
--
from
challenge
and
that
really,
their
assertion
is
the
claim,
directly
a
claim
to
--
to
arbitrary
power.
now,
and
i
began
earlier
by
talking
about
waiver.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
right
of
the
tenant
to
be
free
from
this
kind
of
arbitrary
power,
the
governmental
agency
can't
be
handing
out
benefits
in
this
kind
of
subsidy
program
for
low-income
people,
subsidized
houses.
government
agency
can't
require
them
to
waive
that
--
that
right
and
there
can't,
in
any
event,
be
a
waiver
of
it
unless
there
is
--
there
is
a
classic
waiver
in
the
johnson
and
(inaudible)
knowing
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege.
now,
what
--
what
interest
does
the
tenant
have
at
stake
in
protesting
against
arbitrary
power.
well,
at
first,
it's
obvious
on
the
--
on
the
face
of
the
--
the
findings
which
justify
the
housing
program,
the
findings
in
the
--
the
--
their
basic
enactments
that
---
that
the
tenant's
interest
is
an
interest
in
having
decent
and
safe
and
sanitary
housing,
and
that
he's
only
--
the
tenant
only
admitted,
only
found
eligible
to
get
in
the
project
in
the
first
place
if
there
is
a
scarcity
of
--
of
such
housing
and
if
the
tenant
cannot
afford
decent,
safe,
sanitary
housing
on
a
private
market.
that's
the
only
way
to
get
in,
in
the
first
place.
so,
that
to
evict
them,
arbitrarily,
is
automatically
to
--
to
remit
them
to
the
slums
and
that's
obviously
a
--
a
matter
of
great
consequence
in
--
in
the
life
of
a
family.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
it
is
automatically
renewable
as
long
as
the
rent's
paid
and
--
and
she
doesn't
violate
the
contract.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
she
does.
she
alleges
that
the
--
she
alleges
that
they
evicted
her
and
they
did
evict
her
the
day
after
she
was
elected
president
of
the
tenants'
organization.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
what
i
was
--
what
i
was
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
the
rule
which
makes
the
--
the
state
law
there
which
makes
the
reason
immaterial
prevents
her
from
effectively
litigating
any
first
amendment
claim
--
this
claim
because
if
--
if
the
authority
doesn't
have
to
give
a
reason,
there's
no
way
in
the
world
--
it's
an
issue
that's
unfathomable
if
--
if
they
can
stand
on
a
law
of
silence,
there's
no
way
she
can
litigate
the
claim
any
better
than
she
did
which
is
to
show
the
coincidence
of
events
and
she
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
i
would
think,
which
they
have
attempted
to
rebut
except
by
a
bold
denial
of
an
improper
motive
and
then
standing
on
their
right
to
claim
silence.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
reading
--
reading
the
stipulation,
the
stipulation,
i
think,
should
benefit
both
parties.
that
the
--
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
had
any
valid
reason.
he
said
his
--
the
curious
wording
of
it,
his
reason
is
if
i
have
any
reason
is
not
that
that
is
standing
on
his
right
to
sell.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
now,
the
--
the
agreement
at
trial
was
that
the
trial
judge
could
consider
two
things,
her
affidavit
and
the
stipulation
as
to
what
the
manager
would
testify.
it's
her
affidavit
that
--
and
the
court
made
findings
and
they
accord
with
--
with
the
allegations
in
her
affidavit
as
to
the
coincidence
of
time
and
--
and
the
event.
let
--
let
me
say
it
lastly,
that
i
don't
believe
the
authority
has
any
reasonable
claim
that
--
or
housing
authorities
generally
do
that
giving
a
fundamental
premise
is
unduly
burdensome.
that
the
largest
housing
authority
in
the
nation,
the
city
of
new
york
housing
authority
with
550,000
tenants
gives
hearings
as
the
tenant
board
gives
hearing.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
we
would
request,
your
honor,
a
judgment
reversing,
vacating
or
setting
aside
the
judgment
of
eviction
and
then
leaving
the
housing
authority
to
take
any
further
steps
(inaudible)
it
might
take.
i
would
hope
that
the
--
that
the
judgment
and
opinion
would
make
it
clear
that
the
housing
authority
is
bound
by
the
constitution
in
whatever
it
does
as
a
governmental
agency
and
can't
act
arbitrarily.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
--
that
--
i
don't
believe
you
can
infer
from
the
silence
of
congress
on
the
issue
of
eviction.
any
support
or
authorization
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
full
import
of
your
question
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
--
i
don't
think
congress
could
authorize
in
fact,
arbitrarily,
if
that
answers
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
i
think
that
there
are
limitations
on
the
power
of
the
congress
beyond
the
purely
procedural
ones
as
you
notice
it
here.
although
this
is
the
--
but
this
case
doesn't
present
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
given
particular
rule
adopted
by
a
state
agency
or
approved
by
the
congress
is
reasonable.
we
--
we
don't
have
here
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
rule
that,
for
example,
you
can't
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
--
you
can't
have
dogs
in
the
--
in
the
project
that
violates
due
process.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
question
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
well,
let
--
let
me
just
suggest
on
--
on
this
subject,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
we
are
in
the
kind
of
area
where
perhaps
the
normal
presumptions
of
the
validity
of
legislative
action,
the
--
the
normal
strength
of
that
doctrine
may
not
run
its
full
course
because
if
we
are
in
the
area
of
like
--
like
the
area
of
speech,
i
think,
or
like
the
area
referred
to
in
the
footnote
four
in
the
carolene
product's
case
where
--
where
these
are
under
previous
people
that
have
no
way
of
expression.
unless
the
courts
protect
them,
that
they
have
no
other
political
expression
or
political
structure.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
recognize
that
many
decisions
of
this
court
in
accord
with
--
with
that
notion,
that
is
particularly
the
--
in
the
economic
regulation
field
where
the
court
30
years
ago
or
i
suppose
shifted
course
and
indicated
it
would
not
interfere
with
--
with
legislative
experimentation
and
economic
regulation.
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
that
this
case
is
in
the
area
of
governmental
regulation
of
--
of
intimacies
and
the
privacies
of
people's
lives,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
this
--we
are
in
the
area
where
we're
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
no,
i
--
i
don't
suggest
that
it'd
be
all
judicial,
but
i
suggest
there
are
some
limits
on.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
step
back
a
moment
and
--
and
suggest
that
these
questions
we
are
discussing
which
--
which
i
think
are
things
we
thought
about.
i'm
not
involved
in
--
in
this
case
involving
the
procedural
rights,
the
rights
to
--
to
know
why
the
government
is
acting
against
you
and
the
--
and
the
right
to
have
some
fair
--
fair
chance
to
meet
the
--
with
the
government's
case
when
it's
going
to
cut
off
its
subsidy
to
you.
so,
my
case
today
involves
the
procedural
claim,
but
if
the
court
has
some
--
i
--
i
understood
you
to
be
suggesting
--
we're
not
discussing
the
substitute
problems.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
exactly
understand
the
--
the
relation
of
the
jury
trial
issue
to
this
question
of
reviewing
administrative
regulation
not
directed
by
any
specific
statute.
it's
just
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes.
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
there
is
certainly
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
any
--
in
a
summary
ejectment
action
in
north
carolina.
the
party's
waived
it
in
this
case.
but
--
but
they
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
when
the
--
that
the
court
has
done
that
with
caution,
but
that
the
court
has
properly
done
that
and
--
and
probably
it
should
do
when
--
when
it
deals
with
cases
where
the
bureaucrat
is
making
the
rules
and
regulations
which
governs
the
--
the
privacy
of
a
citizen's
life
and
--
and
which
--
with
which
to
tell
the
citizen
how
he
must
live,
the
bureaucrat
operating
without
any
specific
legislative
guidance.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
well,
i
--
i
suggest
(inaudible),
mr.
justice
black,
that
--
that
when
the
executive
officials
at
the
lower
level,
the
housing
project
manager
level
are
given
basically
unfair
to
discretion
to
--
about
the
decisions
which
really
matter
in
the
lives
of
these
--
of
--
of
poor
people
that
the
judicial
supervision
by
the
due
process
stand
has
to
come
in
play
that
--
that
some
--
that
--
to
get
bad
enough
so
that
everybody
would
agree
that's
arbitrary.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
yes,
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
has
settled
or
has
agreed
that
that
is
totally
arbitrary.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
that
that
is
totally
arbitrary,
racial
distinctions
by
government
are
--
are
forbidden.
mr.
james
m.
nabritt
iii
(inaudible)
we
don't
have
any
time,
to
talk
about.
