justice
hugo
l.

do
you
think
congress
would
have
the
right
to
provide
for
the
building
of
houses,
apartment
houses
and
to
have
aid
and
provide
and
provide
that
the
parties
would
have
the
right
to
contract
among
themselves
as
to
the
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

what
i
am
wondering
is
if
you
are
challenging
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
that
its
management
would
have
the
right
to
make
a
contract
with
the
--
with
the
tenants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
import
--
the
import
is
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
arbitrarily
is
a
word
which
i
don't
know
exactly
the
meaning
of
and
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
given
a
blanket
authority
to
determine
if
conduct
is
arbitrary
and
pass
legislation
to
meaning.
that's
what
i
was
calling.
i
would
call
that
usurping
the
functions
of
the
congress.
what
i'm
wondering
is
if
you're
saying
and
--
and
you
remember,
when
we
decided
on
the
basis
of
so-called
arbitrar
in
the
past,
although
we
are
on
the
constitutional
in
level
and
congress
can't
change
it,
what
we
are
doing
is
establishing
policy
and
choosing
the
policy
which
they
are
to
adopt.
what
i'm
wondering
is,
if
you're
claiming
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
permit
its
apartment
to
be
rented
to
tenants
on
terms
agreed
on
between
the
parties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
reasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
legislative
--
legislation
has
always
adopted
according
to
the
members
of
the
congress
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
they
believe
it's
reasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
have
is
a
question
of
policy
and
can
determined
by
this
court,
and
we
have
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
our
judgment
of
reasonable
and
of
arbitrariness
and
other
(inaudible).
it
gets
us
in
the
field
of
making
policies
in
which
the
legislative
is
supposed
to
do,
and
--
and
they
can't
change
it.
it
gets
into
the
field
of
law
that
is
unchangeable
by
the
legislative
body,
instead
of
letting
the
legislative
body
determine
those
policies.
and
that
is
what
i
understand,
you're
asking
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
governmental.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
making
it
all
judicial.
you
are
trying
to
make
it
all
judicial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
suggesting
that
the
legislative
body
acts
as
a
supervisor
was
a
(inaudible)
that
the
government
has
or
the
department
has
it
are
those
that
it
is
contributing
towards.
that
just
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
you
are
asking.
that's
what
i'm
just
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
--
under
the
procedural
rights
or
the
bill
of
rights
like
the
trial
by
jury
and
then
step
down
and
say
there
are
some
other
thing
that
we
are
going
to
hold
is
unconstitutional
because
we
think
it's
unfair
and
arbitrary.
that's
the
problem
of
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
this
bill
of
rights
require.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
little
bit
of
controversy,
isn't
it?
it
comes
squarely
within
what
i've
usually
's
considered
to
be
a
case
of
controversy,
if
you
make
it
practically
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
it
is
to
bring
into
these
words
that
are
not
in
the
constitution.
say
whenever
the
court
looks
at
all
these
contracts
the
government
makes
these
things
of
different
policy
is
required
in
order
to
make
them
fast
and
non-arbitrary
according
to
the
court's
judgment.
it
decides
that
and
doesn't
wait
for
the
legislative
body.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
man
working
for
the
government
is
a
bureaucrat?
why
wouldn't
that
include
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
laws
passed
on
that
field
by
congress,
which
i
think
is
better
than
having
to
passing
by
this
court.
that's
all
that
--
and
i
just
wanted
to
ask
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
no
testimony
to
the
contrary,
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
working
at
that,
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
for
that
reason
(inaudible)
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
hardly
reaches
the
question,
does
it?
that's
assuming
her
lease
had
run
out
--
had
run
out
and
they
would
--
they
were
hoping
to
get
out
because
she
was
a
negro.
