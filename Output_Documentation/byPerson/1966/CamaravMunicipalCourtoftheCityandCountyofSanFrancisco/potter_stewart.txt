justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
way
you
worded
that,
the
way
you
said
that
was
worded,
that
presumably
i
suppose
with
apply
to
a
policeman
looking
for
a
contraband
in
a
house
or
looking
for
a
criminal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
--
does
it
--
that
wording
it
would
seem
to
give
blanket
authority
to
the
police
department
of
the
city
to
enter
any
house
at
anytime
so
long
as
he
was
looking
for
a
criminal
or
looking
for
anything
to
do
with
the
criminal
offense
without
any
warrant
at
all.
is
it
--
as
your
--
has
the
state
of
california
construed
it
to
mean
that?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
suppose
since
this
--
you're
talking
about
--
we're
talking
about
section
503,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
under
the
san
francisco
municipal
housing
code
and
i
don't
know
about
how
your
supreme
court
construe
statutes
but
i
would
think
that
an
ordinary
--
at
least
to
some
accepted
(inaudible)
construction
as
it
would
--
thought
--
be
thought
to
be
limited
to
duties
under
that
code.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
going
back
to
my
question
about
giving
blanket
authority
to
the
police
in
san
francisco.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wouldn't
think
that
this
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
hearing
from
you
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
how
about
welfare?
that's
not
part
of
the
housing
code
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
that
so
certain?
why
if
you
let
an
elevator
inspector
come
into
a
building
once
a
year
to
inspect
the
safety
of
an
elevator,
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
welfare
inspectors
could
knock
on
dwelling
doors
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
why
if
you're
right?
why
can
he
without
a
warrant?
that
building
belongs
to
somebody
even
the
public
areas.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
say
why
can
he
without
a
warrant?
why
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
elevator
inspector
come
in
annually?
justice
potter
stewart
business
premises
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
the
extent
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
them
they're
protected,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
had
been
long
since
decided
by
this
court
that
it
had
been
answered
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
business
offices
are
protected?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
structures,
they
belong
to
somebody.
it
maybe
a
grasping
landlord
but
he's
a
human
being
too,
wasn't
he?
he's
protected?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
that
you
think
it
could
be
with
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
but
how
about
your
position,
what
do
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
a
single
migratory
rat
would
be
the
sufficient
reason
in
your
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
word
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
one
rat,
one
house?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
get
another
word
to
your
answer
to
justice
fortas'
question
which
i
don't
think
at
least
--
i
haven't
understood
that
you've
answered
yet?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
that
the
health
department
wanted
to
carry
out
a
two
square
block
inspection
of
dwellings
in
a
city
for
the
purposes
of
exterminating
rats
and
other
rodents
which
carry
diseases.
now,
what
would
they
have
to
do
under
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
they
did
all
that
and
every
household
said,
no.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
they
say?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
there
--
we're
searching
to
see
if
there
are
rats.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
then
they
could
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
carry
out
this
program.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
inspections
of
brand
new
buildings
routinely
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
