justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
this
mr.
krause.
an
opinion
in
eaton
and
price,
this
was
said
of
the
situation
then,
but
it
was
not
shown
that
the
inspector
desired
to
make
the
inspection
in
pursuance
to
a
regular
routinized
spot
check
of
individual
homes
or
in
pursuance
for
a
plan
to
blanket
check
of
all
the
houses
in
a
particular
neighborhood
or
the
like.
oh,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
that
implies
that
the
--
in
that
circumstance
no
warrant
is
needed,
you'd
disagree,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
say
if
that
implies
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
this
may
be
done
whether
there's
a
regular
plan,
the
kind
of
inspection,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
annual
inspection
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
disagree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
suppose
the
warrant
were
based
on
no
more
than
this
that
the
inspector
went
to
a
magistrate
and
said,
i
have
--
we
have
a
regular
plan
problem
of
this
sort
of
thing
and
we'd
like
to
go
into
(inaudible)
before
to
do
it.
you'd
still
say
that
that
was
not
sufficient
basis
for
a
warrant,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
you
go
far
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
do
go
far,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
go
far,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
dissent
in
frank
and
maryland
it
will
suggest
that
with
the
--
in
this
circumstance
that
that
which
might
be
required
if
this
were
a
search
where
a
crime
was
involved,
it
might
not
be
required
where
all
that
was
--
it
sought
was
an
inspection
of
the
sites
or
the
sort,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
much
less
would
you
say
that
assuming
that
what
was
said
in
the
dissent
in
frank
and
maryland
where
the
rule
mainly
that
something
less
was
required
than
in
the
criminal
case,
how
much
less
would
satisfy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can't
help
as
to
why
--
how
much
less
there
ought
to
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
will
i
notice
that
mr.
krause
stated
that
this
particular
inspection
was
to
conduct
an
annual
routine
inspection
of
the
premises
indicating
that
it
is
done
once
a
year
but
i
see
that
the
section
says,
at
least
once
a
year
and
has
often
thereafter
is
maybe
deem
necessary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
it
actually,
they
maybe
--
i
suppose
almost
everyday.
they
were
thought
to
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
as
regard
to
this
building
the
record
is
clear
that
this
was
just
a
single
inspection,
annual,
one
and
after
--
not
more
a
often
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
was
saying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
yes,
for
the
same
single
inspection,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
harris,
i
don't
know
if
this
--
i
gather
mr.
(inaudible)
was
seeking
to
releave
for
all
this,
wasn't
it
at
page
37?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
says
this
is
a
reason
of
the
ordinance,
section
86
and
that's
the
one
annual
inspection,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
am
sure
the
effect
of
this
is
apparent
to
the
court
where
the
importance
of
the
city
inspectors
know
how
many
people
are
occupying
the
building
apartment
because
they
won't
have
all
the
power
in
conjunction
with
(inaudible).
so
it
was
in
pursuant
to
this
ordinance
that
they
want
(inaudible).
is
there
any
indication
that
there
was
any
other
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
mr.
justice
fortas
question.
that's
what
bothers
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
the
only
reason
they
went?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
our
we
concerned
with
the
fact
that
there
may
indeed
has
been
other
violations
of
some
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
--
when
they
make
those
(inaudible)
or
a
checklist,
inspected
suppose
to
employ
that
if
it
looks
fire
hazard,
overcrowding,
health
hazard,
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
have
you
taken
this
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
this
mr.
krause.
an
