mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
--
been
made
clear
here
already,
this
case
is
unlike
either
the
eaton
case
or
the
--
or
frank
against
maryland
for
that
matter.
and
it
does
involve
a
routine
inspection
which
was
required
of
the
health
inspector
by
an
ordinance
of
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco.
and
i
have
to
disagree
with
mr.
krause
in
saying
that
this
is
a
case
about
a
health
inspector.
a
health
inspector
was
involved
but
what
this
case
is
about
is
not
his
rights.
the
case
is
about
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
to
enact
the
ordinance
that
they
did
enact
here.
until
an
effect
divests
themselves
of
the
absolute
right
of
property
to
a
minor
degree
in
order
to
accommodate
what
they
felt,
not
what
i
feel,
but
what
they
felt
was
the
primary
interest
of
protecting
the
health
and
safety
of
the
people
of
that
city.
now,
the
same
thing
has
been
done
in
the
area
of
water
pollution
and
the
area
of
air
pollution.
the
last
decade
has
seen
a
real
awakening.
there
interest
of
concern
or
perhaps
conscience
but
this
entire
nation
in
respect
of
the
cities
and
the
conditions
in
housing,
and
in
all
of
the
environment
that
we
live
in.
and
this
is
a
--
this
is
in
san
francisco
was
only
one
of
several
hundred
inspection
codes
and
only
one
of
several
hundred
programs
financed
locally
and
by
the
state
governments,
and
by
the
federal
government
for
that
matter,
in
order
to
bring
about
a
better
city,
in
order
to
bring
about
better
housing,
in
order
to
prevent
blight,
in
order
to
bring
about
a
tolerable
place
for
people
to
live,
and
that
is
what
those
case
is
about.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor
that
was
set
forth
in
the
--
during
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
by
the
district
attorney
who
was
representing
the
respondent
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
he
made
it
clear.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
there
was
no
evidence
taken
your
honor
in
the
superior
court
proceedings.
now
that
was
because
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
that
was
filed
on
the
superior
court
attacked
the
ordinance
as
invalid
and
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
that
is
a
valid
ground
under
california
law
to
attack
the
jurisdiction
of
the
criminal
court,
it
was
the
municipal
court.
consequently,
no
evidence
was
taken
during
the
hearing
in
the
superior
court.
and
as
is
common,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
colloquy
between
the
attorneys
and
between
the
--
and
with
the
trial
judge.
but
it
was
made
clear
that
this
inspection
was
pursuant
to
a
san
francisco
ordinance
that
requires
an
inspection
of
apartment
houses
and
hotels
annually,
every
year.
and
that
the
inspection
was
for
the
purpose
of
determining
compliance
with
the
permit
of
occupancy
that
had
been
issued
to
the
owner
of
the
apartment
house
in
order
to
operate
the
place
and
in
conjunction
with
the
licensing
of
that
apartment
house.
and
that
determination
was
adopted
by
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
reviewing
the
case
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
court
of
a
last
resort
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
--
in
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
pages
36
and
37
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
there
has
been
no
contention
here
that
there
was
any
failure
to
comply
with
the
ordinance.
i
would
like
to
touch
just
for
a
moment
on
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
right
of
entry
authorized
by
section
503
here
might
be
utilized
by
police
officers
in
the
enforcement
of
the
state
law
relating
to
criminal
conduct.
now
that
has
never
been
suggested
by
anyone.
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
itself
is
limited
to
duties
authorized
or
imposed
upon
a
city
employee
by
the
municipal
code.
this
appears
as
a
part
of
the
housing
code.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
remarkable
construction
of
that
ordinance
to
say
that
it
applies
to
anything
that
what
it
purports
to
inspections
in
the
course
of
enforcement
of
the
housing
code
by
health
inspectors
as
required
by
law.
now,
this
inspection
is
not
at
the
whim
of
--
as
i
pointed
out
of
a
health
inspector.
he's
obeying
a
law.
he
is
not
entering
in
violation
of
law.
he
is
not
taking
a
shortcut
to
law
enforcement.
he
is
not
trying
to
get
in
there
in
order
to
do
something
else.
he
is
abiding
by
what
the
people
have
directed
him
to
do
and
that
is
to
inspect
these
apartment
houses
annually.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
section
says.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
i
think
this,
now
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
where
hotels
and
apartment
houses.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
i
think
if
there
is
a
health
problem
in
a
hotel,
you'll
find
them
in
there
just
about
everyday
till
it's
fixed.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
now,
they
came
back
three
times
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
because
they
couldn't
get
in.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
same
single
inspection.
i
believe
that's
a
fair
statement
justice
brennan.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
practice
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
original
question.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
apartment
units
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
in
san
francisco.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
meant
to
say
that
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
the
health
inspectors
attempt
to
inspect
every
single
apartment
in
that
city
every
year.
i
think
that
would
be
far
beyond
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
physical
capacity
available
to
them.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
whether
they
attempt
to
go
into
each
apartment
house,
bear
in
mind
that
this
apartment
house
had
16
apartments
on
the
second
and
third
floors.
they
went
to
the
bottom
floor
which
was
the
store
in
essence
and
was
restricted
to
commercial
use
under
the
permit
of
occupancy.
they
wanted
to
go
into
the
back
because
the
manager
of
the
apartment
house
had
said
that
mr.
camara
is
living
in
the
back
of
the
store.
they
never
got
any
further.
now,
whether
they
would
have
gone
into
every
apartment
there
is
just
something
i
have
no
knowledge
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
but
i'm
sure
they
don't
try
to
do
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
they
--
i'm
certain
that
they
do
try
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
go
to
each
house.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
san
francisco
when
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
50,000
inspection
trips
directed
to
16,000
apartment
buildings
in
the
fiscal
year
of
1964.
now
that's
not
los
angeles
but
it's
--
i
would
say
they
try
to
get
to
every
apartment.
now,
there's
some
room
for
judgment.
i
suppose
with
a
brand
new
apartment
house
you
--
everything
looks
alright,
you
might
decide
your
time
could
be
spent
better
elsewhere.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
none
of
this
was
developed
in
the
record
as
far
as
the
frequency
of
their
inspections.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
very,
very
intensive
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
once
the
--
it's
been
clear
than
the
only
equipment
is
improperly,
i
--
this
is
my
own
suggestion
that
perhaps
you
might
want
to
look
into
the
fillmore
district
or
hunters
point
rather
than
waste
time
going
back.
but
they
have
the
authority
to
go
annually
and
in
fact,
they've
been
directed
to
by
the
people.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
he
was
a
tenant
of
the
entire
ground
floor
which
had
no
apartment
as
such
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
was
the
ground
floor
and
then
the
second
and
third
floors
were
individual
apartments,
eight
on
each
floor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
ground
floor
was
restricted
to
commercial
use
by
the
permit
of
occupancy.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
facilities
mr.
camara
--
now,
mr.
camara
had
a
store
properly
at
the
front
of
the
building.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
facilities
he
had
in
the
back
for
living
or
whether
he
lived
there
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record
except
by
his
own
statement
that
he
did
in
fact
lived
there.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
under
our
housing
code,
that
would
--
that
in
itself
is
not
a
basis
for
any
abatement
proceedings
as
to
mr.
camara
or
anything
else.
improper
occupancy
becomes
a
public
nuisance
only
when
it
rises
to
the
level
of
becoming
a
hazard
to
the
public
or
to
the
occupants
of
the
apartment
house.
and
it
would
be
absolutely
essential
for
the
inspector
to
go
in
there,
take
a
look
at
the
building
that's
all
and
the
interior
of
the
structure
where
--
for
example,
he
might
have
a
stove
in
there
that
was
improperly
vented
or
something
like
that.
and
then
if
the
director
of
public
health,
this
goes
back
to
the
bureaucratic
arrangements
within
the
department
decides
that
this
is
a
public
nuisance
that
he
may
initiate
abatement
proceedings.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
yes
sire
--
no
your
honor.
but
to
see
what
the
nature
of
this
violation
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
but
the
violation
under
the
ordinances
in
san
francisco,
you
cannot
let
apartments
without
affirmative
occupancy
and
that
limits
the
manner
in
which
you
have
let
them.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
if
that
--
that
is
a
matter
for
the
owner
of
the
apartment
house.
there's
no
doubt
he
was
in
violation.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
certainly
is
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
certainly
is.
and
i'd
refer
you
to
page
84
of
the
record
in
this
case
which
contains
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
certainly
it
should
be
a
reference
to
that
section.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
its
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
no,
that
is
the
--
that's
the
--
that
is
the
declaration
of
policy.
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
your
finding
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
improper
occupancy
which
is
using
a
place
to
live
in
that
is
not
designed
for
that
purpose
specifically
provided
as
one
of
the
grounds
upon
which
a
building
may
be
a
substandard
building.
now,
it
may
not
be
a
substandard
building
as
well.
that
is
up
to
the
director
of
the
department
of
public
health.
and
i
allude
to
the
sections
that
we
have
quoted
of
the
ordinance
of
--
at
page
84
and
page
88
of
the
record.
and
it's
only
upon
his
determination
that
this
is
substandard
building.
that's
what
he's
concerned
about.
this
is
the
health
department,
that
--
if
they
are
concerned
with
the
sanitation,
whether
this
is
a
substandard
building
then
they
are
going
to
act.
now
as
far
as
the
--
whether
or
not
this
was
a
violation
of
the
permit
of
occupancy,
it
seems
clear
that
it
was,
but
that
does
not
make
it
a
substandard
building.
that
does
not
make
it
a
public
nuisance
necessarily.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
he
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
there's
no
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
is
no
other
indication
your
honor.
they
went
there
under
the
ordinance
requiring
an
annual
inspection
of
hotels
and
apartment
houses.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
maybe
i've
--
i
haven't
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
--
is
the
reason
that
they
went.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
there
were
any
other
violations.
all
i
was
--
what
i
am
saying
is
this
that
the
inspection
--
the
people
of
san
francisco
have
said
you
go
in
once
a
year
to
apartment
houses
and
hotels.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
for
what
purpose,
do
exercise
or
perform
their
duties
and
their
duties
are
to
determine
whether
these
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
are
substandard
buildings.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
it
relates
to
hotels
and
apartments.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
clear
from
the
record
your
honor
and
we've
taken
the
position
and
i
don't
mean
by
what
i
have
said
here
to
--
in
anyway
affect
that
position
that
this
inspection
was
attempted
pursuant
to
the
ordinance
calling
for
an
annual
inspection
of
apartments
and
hotels
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
and
that
is
the
reason
the
inspection
commenced.
that's
the
reason
they
went
to
225
jones
street
in
san
francisco.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
quite
true
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
would
have
countless
concerns.
the
housing
code
covering
as
it
does
a
multitude
of
matters
relating
to
sanitation
and
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
substandard
building.
but
the
reason
they
went
to
this
particular
apartment
house
was
under
the
duty
imposed
upon
them
by
the
ordinance
to
make
an
annual
inspection.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
the
record
does
not
touch
on
that
your
honor
and
i
can't
say,
as
a
practical
whether
that's
true
or
not.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
would
think
it
certainly
would
be.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
if
i
could
take
that
up
in
both
of
the
hardship
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
--
i
think
the
--
what
your
honor
has
suggested
would
be
a
very
prudent
course
for
a
lady
who
is
confronted
by
a
man
who
says
he
wants
to
make
an
inspection.
and
the
ordinance
requires
that
he
show
his
credentials
when
he
comes
up
to
the
door
to
make
an
inspection.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly
that
could
happen
and
i
think
a
lady
might
be
very
prudent
not
to
rely
simply
on
those
credentials.
she
could
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
probably.
i've
never
seen
their
--
theirs
but
i
presume
that
they
do
your
honor.
they
may
have
a
picture
of
course
that
could
be
forged
as
well.
but
i
would
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
true.
i
would
think
this
that
under
those
circumstances
or
let's
say
even
apart
from
any
fears,
suppose
she's
got
the
children
in
the
house
and
is
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
she
doesn't
want
to
be
bothered
by
somebody
coming
in
at
that
time.
that
it
seems
to
me
of
--
a
reasonable
attitude
on
her
part.
now,
this
ordinance
requires
--
or
only
requires
you
to
admit
an
inspector
at
a
reasonable
time.
we
haven't
had
cases
that
have
construed
that
language
because
there's
--
this
is
the
only
known
opposition
to
the
ordinance
but
i
think
the
pattern
is
very
clear
here
and
it
is
this
that
if
this
is
a
--
this
is
even
an
inconvenient
time
that
you'd
rather
not
have
someone
come
in.
you
might
have
some
guests.
they're
willing
to
come
back
in
a
couple
of
days.
they're
willing
to
come
back
in
a
couple
of
weeks.
they
came
back
here
three
times
and
each
time
were
flatly
denied
entrance.
there
was
even
a
hearing
scheduled
in
the
district
attorney's
office
which
is
a
totally
--
with
an
informal
kind
of
procedure
in
california.
so,
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
proper
for
a
lady
to
protect
herself.
if
she
has
doubts,
she
can
call
up
the
department
of
public
health
and
find
out
if
this
is
legitimate.
find
out
what's
going
on.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
any
answer
to
that
problem
to
say
that
the
people
should
establish
a
search
warrant
procedure.
and
i
think
in
some
of
the
questions
here
one
of
the
main
differences
was
brought
out.
on
a
search
warrant,
you
show
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband,
to
believe
that
the
weapons
of
crime,
to
believe
that
smuggled
goods
or
something
are
in
a
particular
premises,
a
particular
apartment,
a
particular
home.
and
the
magistrate
can
weigh
that
and
decide
whether
or
not
you
should
be
allowed
to
enter
into
that
home
and
search
and
reduce
those
things
to
your
possession.
these
inspections
and
particularly
the
--
this
are
the
annual
inspection
that
we've
been
discussing
and
the
planned
area
inspections
where
several
blocks
are
carved
out
for
inspection
every
--
so
often.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
is
to
determine
what
the
situation
is
in
respect
to
those
buildings,
not
whether
somebody
has
something
tucked
away
in
a
trunk
or
a
chest
some
place
but
to
find
out
what's
going
on
in
there.
and
i
don't
think
a
magi
--
i
think
the
magistrate
would
be
reduced
to
the
position
of
either
rubber
stamping
whatever
is
presented
to
him
of
--
to
say
so
with
the
department
of
public
health
that
they
want
to
make
an
inspection
of
this
10-block
area.
either
that
or
he
is
going
to
turn
himself
into
the
department
of
public
health
and
the
planning
director
and
decide
should
we
go
to
the
fillmore
district.
should
we
make
inspections
in
the
mission
district?
should
we
go
out
in
hunters
point
and
make
inspections
in
this
area?
and
i
don't
think
our
magistrates
are
frankly
equipped
for
that
or
that
there
is
any
requirement
of
law
that
they
do.
that's
certainly
no
requirement
of
the
constitution.
the
magnitude
of
an
effective
inspection
program
is
such
that
i
think
any
requirement
of
a
search
warrant
would
be
abs
--
would
in
effect
mean
you
couldn't
conduct
the
program.
we
have
145,000
inspections
in
1964
by
the
department
of
public
works,
as
i
said
before,
50,000
inspection
trips
to
16,000
buildings
in
the
fiscal
year
of
1964
and
14,500
dwelling
units
inspected
under
the
urban
renewal
program.
now,
there
aren't
enough
magistrates
in
the
united
states
to
issue
warrants
on
affidavits
and
examination
of
those
of
that
kind
of
volume.
but
the
main
thing
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
it.
your
honor
--
your
honors
held
in
frank
against
maryland
that
the
constitution
did
not
require
a
search
warrant.
there's
been
no
abuse
of
that
power
by
the
cities
of
this
--
in
this
land
where
the
cases
or
the
instances
of
any
abuse.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
faith
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
would
be
citing
them
one
after
another
had
there
been
any
abuses?
there
have
never
been
any
in
san
francisco
that
i
know
of
nor
in
seattle.
and
i
think
that
the
program
has
worked.
it's
worked
since
the
beginning
of
this
nation.
it's
been
accepted
by
the
courts,
by
judges,
by
legislators,
by
the
people
of
this
country,
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
one
good
reason,
why
the
system
should
be
changed.
the
only
thing
i've
heard
is
that
there
may
have
been
a
misreading
of
the
--
of
some
of
the
cases.
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
but
even
if
there
were
that
is
not
a
good
reason
to
do
what
i
think
this
court
would
be
doing
and
that
is
taking
a
step
backward
when
a
step
forward
should
be
taken.
when
the
need
for
these
programs
is
more
apparent
now
than
it
was
back
in
1959.
it's
clear
there
are
no
abuses,
none
here
at
all.
why
in
the
world
impose
a
search
warrant
procedure
that
all
of
the
judges,
legislators,
people,
prosecutors,
everyone
of
it
--
since
this
nation
was
formed
never
deem
necessary.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
our
remedy
is
to
charge
him
in
a
warrant
--
a
complaint
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
the
fact
is
that
there
are
not
very
many
of
these.
when
it's
made
clear
to
him
that
the
law
requires
that
he
give
up
his
own
absolute
right
to
the
close
that
door
on
anyone.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that's
it
your
honor.
i
think
the
basic
reason
is
that
people
are
reasonable.
they
understand
that
people
had
lived
down
the
hall
or
depended
on
their
conditions.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
going
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
--
the
fact
is
that
we
found
about
15%
in
san
francisco
in
fire
inspections
who
didn't
let
inspectors
in
voluntarily.
when
the
court
announces
that
it
is
our
constitutional
right
which
it
is
not
now,
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
the
court
announces
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
no.
now,
that
wouldn't
be
of
any
particular
proof
mr.
justice
white
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
into
an
area
of
legislature
decisions
as
to
what
would
be
the
best
course
of
action
and
if
--
as
to
what
may
happen
and
what
we're
concern
with
is
the
constitution
here?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
hope
not
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
hope
not
but
she
has
no
right
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution,
a
conviction
and
sentence
of
anyone
under
this
ordinance
that
it
--
this
doesn't
work.
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
she
has
to
be
convinced
that
she
has
no
right
to
search
a
warrant
does
not
apply.
that's
what
this
court
has
held
and
someone
has
to
explain
it
to
her.
and
that
the
people
that
live
near
have
rights
as
well
as
she
and
every
reasonable
effort
that
she
wants
to
make
to
make
sure
this
is
the
right
person,
to
make
sure
her
husband
is
there,
to
make
sure
of
any
reasonable
conditions
that
can
be
taken
cared
of
your
honor
and
i'm
sure
it
is
taken
cared
of.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
if
she
could
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
she
can
say,
“come
in
in
another
week.”
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
what
--
your
honor,
what
standards
would
the
magistrate
use
under
that
circumstance
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
issue
a
search
warrant
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
facts
would
he
ask
for?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
you'd
never
know
for
one
thing
any
more
of
that
search
warrant
were
not
a
forgery
than
--
for
the
people
whether
that's
suspicious.
but
i
think
the
basic
thing
is
this,
the
people
could
provide
for
that
procedure
if
they
wish
but
they
have
not
provided
for
that.
that
what
your
honor
has
mentioned
is
not
a
search
warrant,
as
i
understand
a
search
warrant
at
all.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
would
be
a
different
thing
and
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
i
say
that
is
the
legislative
decision.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
--
been
made
clear
here
already,
this
case
is
unlike
either
the
eaton
case
or
the
--
or
frank
against
maryland
for
that
matter.
and
it
does
involve
a
routine
inspection
which
was
required
of
the
health
inspector
by
an
ordinance
of
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco.
and
i
have
to
disagree
with
mr.
krause
in
saying
that
this
is
a
case
about
a
health
inspector.
a
health
inspector
was
involved
but
what
this
case
is
about
is
not
his
rights.
the
case
is
about
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
to
enact
the
ordinance
that
they
did
enact
here.
until
an
effect
divests
themselves
of
the
absolute
right
of
property
to
a
minor
degree
in
order
to
accommodate
what
they
felt,
not
what
i
feel,
but
what
they
felt
was
the
primary
interest
of
protecting
the
health
and
safety
of
the
people
of
that
city.
now,
the
same
thing
has
been
done
in
the
area
of
water
pollution
and
the
area
of
air
pollution.
the
last
decade
has
seen
a
real
awakening.
there
interest
of
concern
or
perhaps
conscience
but
this
entire
nation
in
respect
of
the
cities
and
the
conditions
in
housing,
and
in
all
of
the
environment
that
we
live
in.
and
this
is
a
--
this
is
in
san
francisco
was
only
one
of
several
hundred
inspection
codes
and
only
one
of
several
hundred
programs
financed
locally
and
by
the
state
governments,
and
by
the
federal
government
for
that
matter,
in
order
to
bring
about
a
better
city,
in
order
to
bring
about
better
housing,
in
order
to
prevent
blight,
in
order
to
bring
about
a
tolerable
place
for
people
to
live,
and
that
is
what
those
case
is
about.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor
that
was
set
forth
in
the
--
during
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
by
the
district
attorney
who
was
representing
the
respondent
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
he
made
it
clear.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
there
was
no
evidence
taken
your
honor
in
the
superior
court
proceedings.
now
that
was
because
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
that
was
filed
on
the
superior
court
attacked
the
ordinance
as
invalid
and
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
that
is
a
valid
ground
under
california
law
to
attack
the
jurisdiction
of
the
criminal
court,
it
was
the
municipal
court.
consequently,
no
evidence
was
taken
during
the
hearing
in
the
superior
court.
and
as
is
common,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
colloquy
between
the
attorneys
and
between
the
--
and
with
the
trial
judge.
but
it
was
made
clear
that
this
inspection
was
pursuant
to
a
san
francisco
ordinance
that
requires
an
inspection
of
apartment
houses
and
hotels
annually,
every
year.
and
that
the
inspection
was
for
the
purpose
of
determining
compliance
with
the
permit
of
occupancy
that
had
been
issued
to
the
owner
of
the
apartment
house
in
order
to
operate
the
place
and
in
conjunction
with
the
licensing
of
that
apartment
house.
and
that
determination
was
adopted
by
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
reviewing
the
case
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
court
of
a
last
resort
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
--
in
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
pages
36
and
37
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
there
has
been
no
contention
here
that
there
was
any
failure
to
comply
with
the
ordinance.
i
would
like
to
touch
just
for
a
moment
on
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
right
of
entry
authorized
by
section
503
here
might
be
utilized
by
police
officers
in
the
enforcement
of
the
state
law
relating
to
criminal
conduct.
now
that
has
never
been
suggested
by
anyone.
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
itself
is
limited
to
duties
authorized
or
imposed
upon
a
city
employee
by
the
municipal
code.
this
appears
as
a
part
of
the
housing
code.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
remarkable
construction
of
that
ordinance
to
say
that
it
applies
to
anything
that
what
it
purports
to
inspections
in
the
course
of
enforcement
of
the
housing
code
by
health
inspectors
as
required
by
law.
now,
this
inspection
is
not
at
the
whim
of
--
as
i
pointed
out
of
a
health
inspector.
he's
obeying
a
law.
he
is
not
entering
in
violation
of
law.
he
is
not
taking
a
shortcut
to
law
enforcement.
he
is
not
trying
to
get
in
there
in
order
to
do
something
else.
he
is
abiding
by
what
the
people
have
directed
him
to
do
and
that
is
to
inspect
these
apartment
houses
annually.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
section
says.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
i
think
this,
now
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
where
hotels
and
apartment
houses.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
i
think
if
there
is
a
health
problem
in
a
hotel,
you'll
find
them
in
there
just
about
everyday
till
it's
fixed.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
now,
they
came
back
three
times
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
because
they
couldn't
get
in.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
same
single
inspection.
i
believe
that's
a
fair
statement
justice
brennan.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
practice
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
original
question.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
apartment
units
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
in
san
francisco.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
meant
to
say
that
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
the
health
inspectors
attempt
to
inspect
every
single
apartment
in
that
city
every
year.
i
think
that
would
be
far
beyond
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
physical
capacity
available
to
them.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
whether
they
attempt
to
go
into
each
apartment
house,
bear
in
mind
that
this
apartment
house
had
16
apartments
on
the
second
and
third
floors.
they
went
to
the
bottom
floor
which
was
the
store
in
essence
and
was
restricted
to
commercial
use
under
the
permit
of
occupancy.
they
wanted
to
go
into
the
back
because
the
manager
of
the
apartment
house
had
said
that
mr.
camara
is
living
in
the
back
of
the
store.
they
never
got
any
further.
now,
whether
they
would
have
gone
into
every
apartment
there
is
just
something
i
have
no
knowledge
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
but
i'm
sure
they
don't
try
to
do
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
they
--
i'm
certain
that
they
do
try
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
go
to
each
house.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
san
francisco
when
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
50,000
inspection
trips
directed
to
16,000
apartment
buildings
in
the
fiscal
year
of
1964.
now
that's
not
los
angeles
but
it's
--
i
would
say
they
try
to
get
to
every
apartment.
now,
there's
some
room
for
judgment.
i
suppose
with
a
brand
new
apartment
house
you
--
everything
looks
alright,
you
might
decide
your
time
could
be
spent
better
elsewhere.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
none
of
this
was
developed
in
the
record
as
far
as
the
frequency
of
their
inspections.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
very,
very
intensive
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
once
the
--
it's
been
clear
than
the
only
equipment
is
improperly,
i
--
this
is
my
own
suggestion
that
perhaps
you
might
want
to
look
into
the
fillmore
district
or
hunters
point
rather
than
waste
time
going
back.
but
they
have
the
authority
to
go
annually
and
in
fact,
they've
been
directed
to
by
the
people.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
he
was
a
tenant
of
the
entire
ground
floor
which
had
no
apartment
as
such
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
was
the
ground
floor
and
then
the
second
and
third
floors
were
individual
apartments,
eight
on
each
floor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
ground
floor
was
restricted
to
commercial
use
by
the
permit
of
occupancy.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
facilities
mr.
camara
--
now,
mr.
camara
had
a
store
properly
at
the
front
of
the
building.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
facilities
he
had
in
the
back
for
living
or
whether
he
lived
there
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record
except
by
his
own
statement
that
he
did
in
fact
lived
there.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
under
our
housing
code,
that
would
--
that
in
itself
is
not
a
basis
for
any
abatement
proceedings
as
to
mr.
camara
or
anything
else.
improper
occupancy
becomes
a
public
nuisance
only
when
it
rises
to
the
level
of
becoming
a
hazard
to
the
public
or
to
the
occupants
of
the
apartment
house.
and
it
would
be
absolutely
essential
for
the
inspector
to
go
in
there,
take
a
look
at
the
building
that's
all
and
the
interior
of
the
structure
where
--
for
example,
he
might
have
a
stove
in
there
that
was
improperly
vented
or
something
like
that.
and
then
if
the
director
of
public
health,
this
goes
back
to
the
bureaucratic
arrangements
within
the
department
decides
that
this
is
a
public
nuisance
that
he
may
initiate
abatement
proceedings.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
yes
sire
--
no
your
honor.
but
to
see
what
the
nature
of
this
violation
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
but
the
violation
under
the
ordinances
in
san
francisco,
you
cannot
let
apartments
without
affirmative
occupancy
and
that
limits
the
manner
in
which
you
have
let
them.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
if
that
--
that
is
a
matter
for
the
owner
of
the
apartment
house.
there's
no
doubt
he
was
in
violation.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
certainly
is
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
certainly
is.
and
i'd
refer
you
to
page
84
of
the
record
in
this
case
which
contains
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
certainly
it
should
be
a
reference
to
that
section.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
its
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
no,
that
is
the
--
that's
the
--
that
is
the
declaration
of
policy.
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
your
finding
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
improper
occupancy
which
is
using
a
place
to
live
in
that
is
not
designed
for
that
purpose
specifically
provided
as
one
of
the
grounds
upon
which
a
building
may
be
a
substandard
building.
now,
it
may
not
be
a
substandard
building
as
well.
that
is
up
to
the
director
of
the
department
of
public
health.
and
i
allude
to
the
sections
that
we
have
quoted
of
the
ordinance
of
--
at
page
84
and
page
88
of
the
record.
and
it's
only
upon
his
determination
that
this
is
substandard
building.
that's
what
he's
concerned
about.
this
is
the
health
department,
that
--
if
they
are
concerned
with
the
sanitation,
whether
this
is
a
substandard
building
then
they
are
going
to
act.
now
as
far
as
the
--
whether
or
not
this
was
a
violation
of
the
permit
of
occupancy,
it
seems
clear
that
it
was,
but
that
does
not
make
it
a
substandard
building.
that
does
not
make
it
a
public
nuisance
necessarily.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
he
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
there's
no
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
is
no
other
indication
your
honor.
they
went
there
under
the
ordinance
requiring
an
annual
inspection
of
hotels
and
apartment
houses.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
maybe
i've
--
i
haven't
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
--
is
the
reason
that
they
went.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
there
were
any
other
violations.
all
i
was
--
what
i
am
saying
is
this
that
the
inspection
--
the
people
of
san
francisco
have
said
you
go
in
once
a
year
to
apartment
houses
and
hotels.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
for
what
purpose,
do
exercise
or
perform
their
duties
and
their
duties
are
to
determine
whether
these
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
are
substandard
buildings.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now,
it
relates
to
hotels
and
apartments.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
clear
from
the
record
your
honor
and
we've
taken
the
position
and
i
don't
mean
by
what
i
have
said
here
to
--
in
anyway
affect
that
position
that
this
inspection
was
attempted
pursuant
to
the
ordinance
calling
for
an
annual
inspection
of
apartments
and
hotels
in
the
city
of
san
francisco.
and
that
is
the
reason
the
inspection
commenced.
that's
the
reason
they
went
to
225
jones
street
in
san
francisco.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
quite
true
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
would
have
countless
concerns.
the
housing
code
covering
as
it
does
a
multitude
of
matters
relating
to
sanitation
and
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
substandard
building.
but
the
reason
they
went
to
this
particular
apartment
house
was
under
the
duty
imposed
upon
them
by
the
ordinance
to
make
an
annual
inspection.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
the
record
does
not
touch
on
that
your
honor
and
i
can't
say,
as
a
practical
whether
that's
true
or
not.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
would
think
it
certainly
would
be.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
if
i
could
take
that
up
in
both
of
the
hardship
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
--
i
think
the
--
what
your
honor
has
suggested
would
be
a
very
prudent
course
for
a
lady
who
is
confronted
by
a
man
who
says
he
wants
to
make
an
inspection.
and
the
ordinance
requires
that
he
show
his
credentials
when
he
comes
up
to
the
door
to
make
an
inspection.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
now
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly
that
could
happen
and
i
think
a
lady
might
be
very
prudent
not
to
rely
simply
on
those
credentials.
she
could
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
probably.
i've
never
seen
their
--
theirs
but
i
presume
that
they
do
your
honor.
they
may
have
a
picture
of
course
that
could
be
forged
as
well.
but
i
would
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
true.
i
would
think
this
that
under
those
circumstances
or
let's
say
even
apart
from
any
fears,
suppose
she's
got
the
children
in
the
house
and
is
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
she
doesn't
want
to
be
bothered
by
somebody
coming
in
at
that
time.
that
it
seems
to
me
of
--
a
reasonable
attitude
on
her
part.
now,
this
ordinance
requires
--
or
only
requires
you
to
admit
an
inspector
at
a
reasonable
time.
we
haven't
had
cases
that
have
construed
that
language
because
there's
--
this
is
the
only
known
opposition
to
the
ordinance
but
i
think
the
pattern
is
very
clear
here
and
it
is
this
that
if
this
is
a
--
this
is
even
an
inconvenient
time
that
you'd
rather
not
have
someone
come
in.
you
might
have
some
guests.
they're
willing
to
come
back
in
a
couple
of
days.
they're
willing
to
come
back
in
a
couple
of
weeks.
they
came
back
here
three
times
and
each
time
were
flatly
denied
entrance.
there
was
even
a
hearing
scheduled
in
the
district
attorney's
office
which
is
a
totally
--
with
an
informal
kind
of
procedure
in
california.
so,
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
proper
for
a
lady
to
protect
herself.
if
she
has
doubts,
she
can
call
up
the
department
of
public
health
and
find
out
if
this
is
legitimate.
find
out
what's
going
on.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
any
answer
to
that
problem
to
say
that
the
people
should
establish
a
search
warrant
procedure.
and
i
think
in
some
of
the
questions
here
one
of
the
main
differences
was
brought
out.
on
a
search
warrant,
you
show
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband,
to
believe
that
the
weapons
of
crime,
to
believe
that
smuggled
goods
or
something
are
in
a
particular
premises,
a
particular
apartment,
a
particular
home.
and
the
magistrate
can
weigh
that
and
decide
whether
or
not
you
should
be
allowed
to
enter
into
that
home
and
search
and
reduce
those
things
to
your
possession.
these
inspections
and
particularly
the
--
this
are
the
annual
inspection
that
we've
been
discussing
and
the
planned
area
inspections
where
several
blocks
are
carved
out
for
inspection
every
--
so
often.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
is
to
determine
what
the
situation
is
in
respect
to
those
buildings,
not
whether
somebody
has
something
tucked
away
in
a
trunk
or
a
chest
some
place
but
to
find
out
what's
going
on
in
there.
and
i
don't
think
a
magi
--
i
think
the
magistrate
would
be
reduced
to
the
position
of
either
rubber
stamping
whatever
is
presented
to
him
of
--
to
say
so
with
the
department
of
public
health
that
they
want
to
make
an
inspection
of
this
10-block
area.
either
that
or
he
is
going
to
turn
himself
into
the
department
of
public
health
and
the
planning
director
and
decide
should
we
go
to
the
fillmore
district.
should
we
make
inspections
in
the
mission
district?
should
we
go
out
in
hunters
point
and
make
inspections
in
this
area?
and
i
don't
think
our
magistrates
are
frankly
equipped
for
that
or
that
there
is
any
requirement
of
law
that
they
do.
that's
certainly
no
requirement
of
the
constitution.
the
magnitude
of
an
effective
inspection
program
is
such
that
i
think
any
requirement
of
a
search
warrant
would
be
abs
--
would
in
effect
mean
you
couldn't
conduct
the
program.
we
have
145,000
inspections
in
1964
by
the
department
of
public
works,
as
i
said
before,
50,000
inspection
trips
to
16,000
buildings
in
the
fiscal
year
of
1964
and
14,500
dwelling
units
inspected
under
the
urban
renewal
program.
now,
there
aren't
enough
magistrates
in
the
united
states
to
issue
warrants
on
affidavits
and
examination
of
those
of
that
kind
of
volume.
but
the
main
thing
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
it.
your
honor
--
your
honors
held
in
frank
against
maryland
that
the
constitution
did
not
require
a
search
warrant.
there's
been
no
abuse
of
that
power
by
the
cities
of
this
--
in
this
land
where
the
cases
or
the
instances
of
any
abuse.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
faith
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
would
be
citing
them
one
after
another
had
there
been
any
abuses?
there
have
never
been
any
in
san
francisco
that
i
know
of
nor
in
seattle.
and
i
think
that
the
program
has
worked.
it's
worked
since
the
beginning
of
this
nation.
it's
been
accepted
by
the
courts,
by
judges,
by
legislators,
by
the
people
of
this
country,
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
one
good
reason,
why
the
system
should
be
changed.
the
only
thing
i've
heard
is
that
there
may
have
been
a
misreading
of
the
--
of
some
of
the
cases.
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
but
even
if
there
were
that
is
not
a
good
reason
to
do
what
i
think
this
court
would
be
doing
and
that
is
taking
a
step
backward
when
a
step
forward
should
be
taken.
when
the
need
for
these
programs
is
more
apparent
now
than
it
was
back
in
1959.
it's
clear
there
are
no
abuses,
none
here
at
all.
why
in
the
world
impose
a
search
warrant
procedure
that
all
of
the
judges,
legislators,
people,
prosecutors,
everyone
of
it
--
since
this
nation
was
formed
never
deem
necessary.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
our
remedy
is
to
charge
him
in
a
warrant
--
a
complaint
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
the
fact
is
that
there
are
not
very
many
of
these.
when
it's
made
clear
to
him
that
the
law
requires
that
he
give
up
his
own
absolute
right
to
the
close
that
door
on
anyone.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that's
it
your
honor.
i
think
the
basic
reason
is
that
people
are
reasonable.
they
understand
that
people
had
lived
down
the
hall
or
depended
on
their
conditions.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
going
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
--
the
fact
is
that
we
found
about
15%
in
san
francisco
in
fire
inspections
who
didn't
let
inspectors
in
voluntarily.
when
the
court
announces
that
it
is
our
constitutional
right
which
it
is
not
now,
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
the
court
announces
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
no.
now,
that
wouldn't
be
of
any
particular
proof
mr.
justice
white
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
into
an
area
of
legislature
decisions
as
to
what
would
be
the
best
course
of
action
and
if
--
as
to
what
may
happen
and
what
we're
concern
with
is
the
constitution
here?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
hope
not
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
hope
not
but
she
has
no
right
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution,
a
conviction
and
sentence
of
anyone
under
this
ordinance
that
it
--
this
doesn't
work.
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
she
has
to
be
convinced
that
she
has
no
right
to
search
a
warrant
does
not
apply.
that's
what
this
court
has
held
and
someone
has
to
explain
it
to
her.
and
that
the
people
that
live
near
have
rights
as
well
as
she
and
every
reasonable
effort
that
she
wants
to
make
to
make
sure
this
is
the
right
person,
to
make
sure
her
husband
is
there,
to
make
sure
of
any
reasonable
conditions
that
can
be
taken
cared
of
your
honor
and
i'm
sure
it
is
taken
cared
of.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
if
she
could
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
she
can
say,
“come
in
in
another
week.”
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
what
--
your
honor,
what
standards
would
the
magistrate
use
under
that
circumstance
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
issue
a
search
warrant
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
facts
would
he
ask
for?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
you'd
never
know
for
one
thing
any
more
of
that
search
warrant
were
not
a
forgery
than
--
for
the
people
whether
that's
suspicious.
but
i
think
the
basic
thing
is
this,
the
people
could
provide
for
that
procedure
if
they
wish
but
they
have
not
provided
for
that.
that
what
your
honor
has
mentioned
is
not
a
search
warrant,
as
i
understand
a
search
warrant
at
all.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
would
be
a
different
thing
and
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
i
say
that
is
the
legislative
decision.
thank
you.
