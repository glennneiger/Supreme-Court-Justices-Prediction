mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
other
cases
interpreting
this
section
other
than
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
you
conceive
that
if
the
city
had
bubonic
plague
for
instance
that
--
and
the
statute
gave
this
power
of
inspection
that
if
they
were
making
an
inspection
of
the
whole
city,
let's
say,
and
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
whether
it
was
rat
infested
and
the
owner,
resident
of
the
property
refused
to
let
the
inspector
to
come
in,
that
the
magistrate
could
issue
a
warrant
for
this
inspector,
would
you
say
that
couldn't
be
done?
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
do
have
--
we
do
--
we
have
had
inspections
of
that
kind
in
your
own
city
when
they
did
have
a
bubonic
plague
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
some
recollection
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
a
very
hard
thing
to
get
rid
off
and
is
that
--
does
that
mean
that
they're
barred
from
doing
it
even
though
they
get
--
even
they
--
though
they
get
a
warrant
for
inspection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient
cause
for
them
to
get
a
warrant
from
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
many
area
in
the
city
they
might
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
fire
department
found
that
a
defective
wiring
was
the
cause
of
many
devastating
fires
and
the
people
have
been
losing
their
lives
because
of
these
fires.
and
the
city
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
require
inspection
of
the
wiring
throughout
the
city
to
see
if
there
--
that
it
was
defective.
and
a
person
refused
to
permit
inspector
to
go
in.
would
you
say
that
the
magistrate
could
not
in
those
circumstances
issue
a
warrant
for
the
inspection
just
on
those
facts
and
no
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this
then
in
this
(inaudible).
i'll
ask
you,
do
you
--
in
order
to
win
your
case,
do
you
have
to
go
this
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
or
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
you
think
you
should
try
to
think
of
all
the
possibilities
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
to
--
and
defend
all
of
the
actions
of
the
private
individuals
in
such
cases
or
aren't
you
--
since
you
stick
pretty
much
to
the
facts
of
your
own
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
well,
wouldn't
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
have
no
more
time
for
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
you
have
taken
(inaudible).
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harris,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
about
this
--
the
purpose
of
this
inspection.
but
where
--
what
does
the
record
show
on
that
and
where
will
we
find
what
the
real
purpose
of
the
inspection
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
statement
of
the
district
attorney
at
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
36
and
37,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harris,
may
i
ask
you
if
it
is
actually
the
practice
of
the
city
and
county
of
the
san
francisco
to
inspect
every
apartment
in
the
city
of
san
francisco
every
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
concerning
this
situation
because
mr.
krause
said
that,
so
that
here
we
have
an
inspector
going
to
the
premises
to
conduct
an
inspection
of
the
premises
pursuant
to
section
86
in
the
municipal
code
part
3.
at
this
point,
he
is
unaware
that
there
is
an
existing
violation,
in
violation
of
an
existing
permit.
now,
if
they
do
not
do
this
as
a
regular
thing
and
inspect
all
of
the
apartments
in
the
city
and
if
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
any
violation
of
any
kind
here
what
was
he
there
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
do
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
harris,
may
i
ask
this,
was
this
living
quarters
of
the
petitioner
a
part
of
the
apartment
house?
was
he
renting
that
from
the
apartment
house
owner
or
was
this
a
business
premise
separated
from
the
apartment
house
where
the
man
was
utilizing
it
as
a
living
quarters
on
his
own?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
had
no
connection
with
the
apartment
house?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harris,
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
some
of
us
and
me
at
least
is
this.
i
don't
think
that
everybody
or
any
great
percentage
of
the
people
are
going
to
demand
the
--
a
search
warrant
for
a
thing
of
this
kind
but
in
this
day
and
age,
and
so
many
things
are
happening
to
women
for
instance.
if
a
stranger
comes
to
her
door
and
say
--
your
--
when
her
husband
is
away,
she
is
there
all
by
herself
and
he
says,
i
want
to
come
into
your
house
to
make
an
inspection.
is
there
anything
wrong
for
her
to
say,
"well,
i
want
to
see
your
authority
to
inspect
my
home
before
i
let
you
in".
and
then
is
there
anything
wrong
in
having
the
inspector
under
those
circumstances,
go
to
the
magistrate
and
get
the
--
get
an
--
make
an
affidavit
and
get
an
inspection.
it
would
be
much
easier
than
to
have
a
man
come
back
three
times
as
this
man
had
did
and
each
time
without
a
warrant.
now,
those
things
when
you're
speaking
of
the
health
and
the
safety
of
your
community,
i
think
bear
a
little
more
heavily
on
public
safety
even
in
the
--
than
some
of
this
routine
inspections
that
you're
talking
about.
so,
isn't
there
a
real
question
of
the
right
of
privacy
in
the
home
here
which
a
family
would
have
a
right
to
protect
and
particularly
a
woman
and
in
the
day
time,
a
man
is
rarely
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
anybody
can
get
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
anybody
can
get
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know?
how
do
we
know
there's
hasn't
been?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
deal
with
the
question
i
asked
you
a
little
awhile
ago
that
for
a
moment
there's
a
woman
in
her
home
alone
with
her
children
and
a
man
comes
to
her
door
and
says,
“i
will
come
in
and
inspect
your
house.
i'm
a
department
house
inspector”.
and
she
just
feels
in
view
of
the
conditions
in
the
community
and
what's
happening
to
the
great
many
other
housewives
in
the
community
that
she's
afraid
for
both
of
her
children
and
herself
to
let
a
person
like
--
get
in
and
she
said
--
says
to
him,
“i
won't
let
you
come
in
unless
you
have
a
search
warrant
to
do
--
perform
this
job”.
and
what
do
you
going
to
do
with
that
woman
now?
you're
going
to
put
her
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
have
a
right
to
insist
on
this
man
coming
in
to
her
house
and
there
are
just
thousands
and
thousands
of
women
in
that
situation
in
our
state,
what
do
you
going
to
do
about
it?
you're
going
to
say,
”well,
a
woman
can
say
that
she
won't
let
a
person
in
but
a
man
can?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
by
repetitive
business
going
back,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
back
and
back
and
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
much
easier
to
let
--
to
have
him
get
this
authorization
to
make
the
inspection
go
and
so
on
said
lady,
there
is
the
--
here's
the
warrant
that
the
judge
issued
and
the
--
its
much
easier
than
--
even
in
this
case
for
the
man
who
went
back
three
times
just
to
have
him
--
tell
him
no,
i
won't
let
you
go
in.
i'll
admit
that
i
live
there
but
i
won't
let
you
go
in
my
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
--
for
myself,
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
have
a
health
ordinance
that
calls
for
annual
inspection
for
apartment
houses
and
it's
his
duty
to
go
to
this
apartment
house.
and
a
man
or
woman
won't
let
him
in,
all
he
has
to
do
is
go
back
and
get
a
warrant
to
admit
him.
and
when
he
has
that,
he
has
the
power
of
the
law
behind
him,
and
if
they
don't
obey
that
then
we've
got
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that
most
people
would
do
that
--
would
let
people
in
anyway
if
there's
no
danger
of
any
--
anything
wrong
happening.
and
he's
not
going
to
change
her
character
and
make
them
all
demand
search
warrants,
do
you
think
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it's
an
administrative
warrant.

do
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
your
case?
chief

earl

but
we
do
have
--
we
do
--
we
have
had
inspections
of
that
kind
in
your

when
they
did

chief

some

(inaudible)
chief

was
a

get

chief

well,
that's
what
i
mean.
chief

but
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient

for

to
get

instance.
if
a
stranger
comes
to
her
door
and
say
--
your
--
when
her
husband
is
away,
she
is
there
all
by
herself
and
he
says,
i
want
to
come
into
your
house
to
make
an
inspection.
is
there
anything
wrong
for
her
to
say,
"well,
i
want
to
see
your
authority
to
inspect
my
home
before
i
let
you
in".
and
then
is
there
anything
wrong
in
having
the
inspector
under
those
circumstances,
go
to
the
magistrate
and
get
the
--
get
an
--
make
an
affidavit
and
get
an
inspection.
it
would
be
much
easier
than
to
have
a
man
come
back
three
times
as
this
man
had
did
and
each
time
without
a
warrant.
now,
those
things
when
you're
speaking
of
the
health
and
the
safety
of
your
community,
i
think
bear
a
little
more
heavily
on
public
safety
even
in
the
--
than
some
of
this
routine
inspections
that
you're
talking
about.
so,
isn't
there
a
real
question
of
the
right
of
privacy
in
the
home
here
which
a
family
would
have
a
right
to
protect
and
particularly
a
woman
and
in
the
day
time,
a
man
is
rarely
there.
chief
justice

warren
yes,
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
anybody
can
get
a

chief
justice
earl
warren
anybody
can
get
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know?
how
do
we
know
there's
hasn't
been?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
deal
with
the
question
i
asked
you
a
little
awhile
ago
that
for
a
moment
there's
a
woman
in
her
home
alone
with
her
children
and
a
man
comes
to
her
door
and
says,
“i
will
come
in
and
inspect
your
house.
i'm
a
department
house
inspector”.
and
she
just
feels
in
view
of
the
conditions
in
the
community
and
what's
happening
to
the
great
many
other
housewives
in
the
community
that
she's
afraid
for
both
of
her
children
and
herself
to
let
a
person
like
--
get
in
and
she
said
--
says
to
him,
“i
won't
let
you
come
in
unless
you
have
a
search
warrant
to
do
--
perform
this
job”.
and
what
do
you
going
to
do
with
that
woman
now?
you're
going
to
put
her
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
have
a
right
to
insist
on
this
man
coming
in
to
her
house
and
there
are
just
thousands
and
thousands
of
women
in
that
situation
in
our
state,
what
do
you
going
to
do
about
it?
you're
going
to
say,
”well,
a
woman
can
say
that
she
won't
let
a
person
in
but
a
man
can?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
by
repetitive
business
going
back,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
back
and
back
and
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
much
easier
to
let
--
to
have
him
get
this
authorization
to
make
the
inspection
go
and
so
on
said
lady,
there
is
the
--
here's
the
warrant
that
the
judge
issued
and
the
--
its
much
easier
than
--
even
in
this
case
for
the
man
who
went
back
three
times
just
to
have
him
--
tell
him
no,
i
won't
let
you
go
in.
i'll
admit
that
i
live
there
but
i
won't
let
you
go
in
my
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
--
for
myself,
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
have
a
health
ordinance
that
calls
for
annual
inspection
for
apartment
houses
and
it's
his
duty
to
go
to
this
apartment
house.
and
a
man
or
woman
won't
let
him
in,
all
he
has
to
do
is
go
back
and
get
a
warrant
to
admit
him.
and
when
he
has
that,
he
has
the
power
of
the
law
behind
him,
and
if
they
don't
obey
that
then
we've
got
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that
most
people
would
do
that
--
would
let
people
in
anyway
if
there's
no
danger
of
any
--
anything
wrong
happening.
and
he's
not
going
to
change
her
character
and
make
them
all
demand
search
warrants,
do
you
think
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it's
an
administrative
warrant.
