mr.
marshall
w.
krause
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
this
is
a
health
inspector
case
and
involves
with
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
is
the
vexing
an
important
problem
which
has
been
with
us
for
a
long
time.
the
appellant
in
this
case
believes
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
more
than
written
of
mere
words.
it
was
written
of
the
long
experience
of
the
colonists
under
the
english
rule
in
framing
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
written
as
its
very
word
state
to
protect
the
security
of
the
citizens
and
residents
of
this
country.
it
was
not
meant
to
be
a
nose
of
wax
to
be
twisted
to
the
convenience
of
petty
government
officials.
this
case
arose
when
an
official
wish
to
inspect
the
apartment
of
the
appellant
because
he
had
learned
that
the
appellant
was
living
in
an
apartment
which
he
did
not
believe
was
covered
by
a
certificate
of
occupancy
in
an
apartment
house.
he
went
to
the
appellant,
asked
him
whether
he
as
living
in
this
apartment,
the
appellant
said,
“yes,
he
was”.
the
health
inspector
then
said,
“may
i
come
in
and
inspect.”
the
answer
was,
“do
you
have
a
warrant?
do
you
have
a
complaint?”
the
answers
to
both
of
those
questions
were,
“no.
this
is
a
routine
inspection.”
and
it
was
a
routine
inspection,
permission
was
denied.
again,
the
health
inspector
came
back
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
appellee
claims
that
that
was
the
power
that
the
inspector
was
pursuing
at
the
time,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
there
was
no
complaint
at
all.
the
only
reason
which
has
ever
been
offered
is
that
the
apartment
may
not
have
been
the
covered
by
the
certificate
of
occupancy
but
that
was
sufficiently
answered
when
the
appellant
said,
"yes,
i
do
live
here".
and
then
the
inspector
came
back
two
more
times
and
on
the
second
--
third
visit,
november
22nd,
1963
in
the
afternoon,
the
inspector
again
required
--
said
that
he
wanted
to
enter
the
apartment.
it
was
denied,
permission
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
and
for
this
offense
on
november
22nd,
the
appellant
was
charged
with
a
crime.
we
attempted
to
prohibit
that
crime
through
california
procedures
in
the
california
courts
but
that
prohibition
proceeding
did
not
succeed
because
the
courts
below
relied
on
frank
versus
maryland.
now,
the
inspection
was
done
under
section
503
of
the
san
francisco
municipal
code
which
provides
that
any
city
employee
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
may
inspect
any
premises
at
reasonable
times
as
long
as
he
is
performing
his
duties.
you
will
note
that
the
statute
does
not
require
any
warrant.
it
does
not
require
any
probable
cause.
it
was
--
it
does
not
require
any
complaint
and
no
appointment
is
necessary.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
it
says
any
city
official
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
it's
not
limited
in
any
way.
although,
it
is
a
part
of
the
municipal
code
the
--
however,
i
would
point
out
that
the
municipal
code
does
contain
criminal
sections
which
punish
certain
acts
as
crimes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
they
haven't.
in
all
fairness
i
should
say,
that
i
know
of
no
instance
where
a
policeman
on
his
own
in
searching
for
some
criminal
evidence
has
used
this
statute
as
you
say
the
wording
of
the
statute
as
any
city
employee
and
certainly
the
policeman
are
city
employees.
as
of
yet,
no
policeman
has
tried
to
use
this
section
to
my
knowledge.
we
have
no
guarantee
that
they
wouldn't
try
it.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
welfare
department
has
not
tried
to
use
this
section
but
we
certainly
maintain
and
there
is
a
case
in
california
called
the
parrish
versus
alameda
county
where
the
welfare
department
does
claim
the
right
to
come
in
to
people
receiving
welfare
and
inspect
to
see
if
the
regulations
are
being
followed.
and
we
think
that
if
this
case
should
be
affirmed
that
the
welfare
people
would
certainly
take
advantage
of
it
as
well
as
property
tax
people,
urban
development
people,
anyone
who
thought
that
they
had
a
reasonable
interest
in
coming
into
a
home.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
just
mentioned
it.
we
don't
--
we
cite
the
parrish
case.
we
don't
discuss
it
fully.
we
mentioned
these
examples
that
there
and
--
now,
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
none
your
--
none
at
all.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
then
section
507
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
makes
it
a
crime
punishable
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
by
six
months
in
prison.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
there
are
criminal
violations
under
that
code
and
policemen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
would
doubt
it
and
we
don't
claim
that
the
police
are
using
this
to
search
for
narcotics,
peddlers
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
but
the
--
the
why
--
the
reason
i
asked
--
answered
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
the
way
i
did
is
that
this
case
obviously
is
going
to
be
setting
the
trend
for
all
such
inspections.
and
now
under
the
law,
if
a
health
inspector
is
allowed
to
come
in
without
a
warrant
certainly
welfare
inspectors,
property
tax
people,
other
people
interested
in
performing
their
duties
officiously
are
not
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh,
i
don't
think
the
elevator
inspector
is
an
example
which
causes
me
any
trouble
because
there's
a
public
building
and
each
elevator
is
licensed.
and
we
would
contend
that
the
elevator
inspector
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
look
at
this
license
premises
to
determine
whether
it's
safe.
and
we
contend
that
the
health
inspector
has
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
public
areas
of
an
apartment
house.
the
fire
inspector
can
look
at
the
fire
escapes.
it
is
only
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
the
private
area
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
that
the
reason
that
he
can't
without
a
warrant
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
people
shall
be
secure
in
their
homes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh!
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
because
this
is
the
business
premises
open
to
the
public
and
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
this
is
premises
to
the
extent
that
they're
not
open
to
the
public
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
persons,
papers,
effects
and
houses.
now,
whether
the
business
premises
come
within
those
words
or
not
is
a
question
we
don't
need
to
answer.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
there
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
there
are
protections
for
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
he's
protected
in
the
private
areas
but
i
don't
think
that
if
--
this
court
has
decided
that
if
a
man
holds
out
his
premises
open
to
the
public
that
he
can
object
because
a
policeman
walks
in
or
because
a
health
inspector
walks
in.
those
people
have
the
right
to
enter
just
as
any
other
member
of
the
public
or
the
premises'
license
such
as
a
restaurant.
it
has
to
maintain
its
license
and
as
a
condition
of
that
license
submits
to
inspection
which
all
restaurants
and
other
places
do.
then
the
inspectors
may
come
in
but
homes,
apartments,
are
not
licensed
and
there
is
not
that
granting
of
consent.
now,
the
frank
case
is
of
course
extremely
important
here.
we
want
to
point
out
that
the
frank
case
was
decided
before
mapp
versus
ohio
and
the
frank
case
in
its
terminology
and
its
discussion
is
all
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
reasonableness.
we
think
that
mapp
versus
ohio
in
deciding
unequivocally
that
the
fourth
amendment
contains
the
exclusionary
rule
binding
on
the
states
changes
the
complexion
and
the
view
in
which
this
court
should
view
a
search
and
seizure
case
coming
from
the
state
courts.
we
think
now
that
there's
no
question
that
the
full
power
of
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
such
cases.
the
frank
case
found
two
kinds
of
security
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they
found
the
security
to
be
protected
against
the
search
for
criminal
evidence,
to
be
protected
by
the
warrant
procedure
but
it
said,
when
there's
no
specific
search
for
criminal
evidence
then
only
test
is
reasonableness
and
no
warrant
is
required.
that
was
the
dichotomy
drawn
by
frank.
we
don't
think
that
this
dichotomy
is
acceptable
anymore
now
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
fully
applicable
to
the
states.
but
we
point
out
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
limited
in
terms
in
any
distinction
between
a
criminal
search
and
a
noncriminal
search.
it
is
drafted
to
protect
security
and
does
not
mention
the
fourth
amendment.
does
not
mention
the
--
any
dichotomy
between
criminal
and
non
criminal.
it
is
true
that
when
we're
considering
what
effect
the
fifth
amendment
has
when
considered
with
the
fourth
amendment
then
we
consider
the
protection
against
self-incrimination
then
we
consider
the
criminal
elements
of
this.
there
is
no
historical
evidence
that
we
have
found
to
satisfy
the
idea
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
between
an
intrusion
into
ones
home
or
criminal
evidence
purposes
and
for
not
criminal
evidence
purposes.
both
are
intrusions.
both
i
think
were
objectionable
in
england
on
the
right
controversy
over
general
warrants
ensued
and
the
idea
in
england
as
it
should
be
here
today
in
america
is
that
warrants
are
required
for
all
such
intrusions.
the
colonist
had
experience
with
the
intrusion
of
government
officials
attempting
to
enforce
laws,
basically
smuggling
laws.
the
colonist
objected
and
i
would
say
that
john
adams
and
james
madison
objected
to
the
searches
of
homes
not
because
some
smuggled
goods
might
be
found
and
some
goods
might
be
forfeited
or
someone
might
be
convicted
of
a
crime
but
because
of
the
insult
that
the
intrusion
into
ones
home
causes.
the
insult
that
a
knock
on
the
door
is
a
statement
that
we
have
the
right
to
enter
and
you
don't
have
the
right
to
keep
us
out
and
we
don't
have
to
even
tell
you
if
there's
something
wrong
or
if
there's
some
complaint.
this
is
the
insult
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
what
the
claim
is,
yes.
but
the
particular
inspection
of
my
client's
apartment,
the
only
reason
given
is
because
the
apartment
may
not
have
been
covered
in
the
permit
of
occupancy
because
it
was
on
the
ground
floor
rather
than
on
the
second
or
third
floor.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
he
did
live
in
the
rear
of
the
store.
that's
what
he
told
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
the
inspector
and
that's
the
fact.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
sir.
i
don't.
i
think
that
it's
permissible
for
the
inspector
to
enter
the
common
areas
of
the
apartment
house
such
as
the
hallways
and
the
fire
escapes
which
are
open
to
anyone
to
contact
the
manager
to
see
that
his
license
is
being
enforced.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
home
is
that
bastion
of
privacy
which
not
only
the
framers
of
the
fourth
amendment
meant
to
protect
but
that
we
must
protect
to
preserve
the
security
and
privacy
which
is
so
significant
today,
the
home,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
that
was
a
separate
apartment
and
there's
no
dis
--
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
anyone
can
enter
that
place
of
business.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
door
was
open.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
he
was
selling
books
there.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
some
emergency
or
something
of
that
sort,
yes.
and
there
was
a
distinction
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
objection
to
the
health
officer's
presence
came
when
he
demanded
to
enter
the
resident's
part
of
the
appellant's
premises.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
first
of
all,
the
procedure
of
the
health
inspectors
would
be
to
seek
consent
and
we
think
that
he
should
seek
consent.
not
only
should
he
seek
consent
but
he
should
educate
the
public
as
to
the
value
of
his
inspection
as
to
what
he
is
doing.
he
should
let
people
know
in
advance
that
he
will
be
there
and
this
will
induce
consent
on
the
part
of
many
people.
and
now,
if
there
are
--
then
people
who
resists,
the
question
comes,
is
there
sufficient
facts
to
give
to
a
magistrate
under
oath
so
that
the
magistrate
may
issue
a
search
warrant
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
allow
the
inspection
of
that
premises.
a
search
warrant
would
describe
the
premises
to
be
searched,
what
was
being
searched
for.
it
wouldn't
be
just
a
knock
on
the
door,
an
unexpected
knock
on
the
door.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
i
think
under
that
situation,
any
house
in
any
city
could
be
inspected
because
there
is
at
least
one
rat
in
every
city,
if
not,
many
more.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
it
could
be
in
--
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
in
my
judgment,
there
must
be
probable
cause
under
oath
given
to
a
magistrate
that
there
are
some
reason
to
inspect
these
premises.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
of
course,
that's
a
factual
thing
mainly
to
be
balanced
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
by
the
magistrate.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
it
comes
out
of
the
house
and
if
the
health
inspector
can
say
when
we
see
a
rat
coming
out
of
the
house,
we
know
that
they're
likely
to
be
more
that
there
are
--
that
these
creates
health
problems
then,
yes.
one
rat
could
be
sufficient.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
one
rat
per
house?
i
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
think
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
alright.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
would
first
have
to
go
and
see
if
they
could
make
this
inspection
on
the
basis
of
consent
which
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
alright,
they
had
two
blocks
and
now
--
then
they
would
go
to
a
magistrate
and
they
would
say
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
would
say
depending
on
the
facts.
if
they
said,
we
know
that
there
are
rats
in
this
neighborhood.
we've
seen
them
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
then
that's
not
sufficient
justice
stewart.
that's
just
the
mere
suspicion
and
they
could
search
--
they
could
say
that
there
might
be
rats
in
any
home
and
any
one
of
our
homes
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
could
be
searched.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
could
not.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
could
not.
i'm
not
saying
that
they
couldn't
inspect.
they
couldn't
get
a
warrant
for
more
than
one
house
because
they
might
have
probable
cause
for
more
than
one
house.
but
they
could
not
search
on
the
basis
of
mere
suspicion
without
facts.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
that
--
it
is
in
our
position
that
that
is
not
probable
cause.
that
is
mere
authority
to
make
an
inspection
without
probable
cause.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
i
think
the
probable
cause
must
be
specified
as
something
specific
as
to
this
home
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
or
these
group
of
homes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
unless
they
can
show
some
peculiar
thing.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
now,
i
would
just
want
to
mention
that
in
the
long
history
of
search
and
seizure
cases
under
this
court
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i
have
to
find
--
if
i
don't
i
have
to
find
an
exception.
of
course,
there's
always
been
an
emergency
exception.
if
someone
is
yelling
fire
or
help
police,
the
fireman
or
the
policeman
may
enter.
if
there
is
that
emergency,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that
was
probably
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
before
my
day
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
they
get
a
warrant,
of
course
they
can
make
an
inspection
but
we
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
they
went
to
the
magistrate
and
they
said
we
have
a
bubonic
plague
outbreak
and
it's
likely
to
becoming
from
this
area
and
we
know
that
there
are
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
in
that
situation,
i
don't
think
they
could
get
a
warrant
allowing
them
to
inspect
every
home
in
the
city
unless
they
could
show
that
there's
some
specific
reason
why
every
home
in
the
city
should
be
inspected.
i
know
that's
an
extreme
example
and
you're
backing
me
to
the
wall
but
i
have
to
be
consistent
here
and
say
that
they
should
be
able
to
come
up
with
some
facts
that
they
can
give
an
affidavit
to
a
magistrate
and
if
they
can't
they're
not
very
good
health
inspectors
whether
the
facts
are
that
this
is
an
old
house
that
might
be
sufficient
in
a
bubonic
plague
situation.
and
because
rat
infester
and
old
houses
and
rats
carry
bubonic
plague,
i
think
any
good
health
inspector
worth
his
salt
could
get
a
warrant
and
be
able
to
give
facts
and
solve
that
situation.
i
don't
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
no
warrant
is
needed,
i
--
for
--
the
first
part
of
that
language
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
that's
what
it
implies.
i
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
would
disagree
with
--
i
know
and
--
i
would
disagree
with
that
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
that
violates
the
privacy
which
was
intended
to
be
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
the
opinion
of
the
appellant.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
pardon
me?
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i
don't
think
it
goes
far.
i
don't
think
it's
hard
to
get
probable
cause
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
if
they
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
certainly,
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
almost
impossible
to
answer.
each
case
must
come
up
on
its
own
facts.
in
this
case,
no
warrant
was
even
applied
for
and
the
government
is
claiming
the
right
to
go
in
without
even
applying
for
a
warrant.
i
think
that
the
standard
that
a
magistrate
would
use
in
judging
a
warrant
for
probable
cause
might
well
be
different
than
a
criminal
case
and
in
that
extent
i
agree
with
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i've
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
must
come
up
with
some
facts
justifying
an
inspection
of
this
specific
house
or
this
specific
small
individualized
area
and
these
must
be
particular
facts.
if
it
were
said
in
the
affidavit
that
these
homes
were
built
100
years
ago
similar
homes
are
deteriorating
that
may
be
sufficient
factual
allegations
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
i
would
say
that
that
the
magistrate
has
--
would
have
no
sworn
facts
before
him
indicating
that
the
wiring
in
this
house
was
in
any
way
defective.
if
you
give
me
a
little
more
facts
if
you
say
that
the
health
officer
or
the
electrical
inspector
was
able
to
allege
that
this
house
was
50
years
old
and
that
the
wiring
is
50
years
old
that
may
be
sufficient.
let
me
throw
out
one
more
thing
because
i
think
it's
important.
i
think
there
are
alternatives
for
the
various
situations
you
suggest.
i
think
of
the
city
is
concerned
about
wiring,
it
could
require
an
affirmative
obligation
which
wouldn't
invade
privacy
that
is
that
each
householder
get
a
certificate
of
compliance
with
current
standards
of
wiring.
and
that
would
be
done
by
a
licensed
inspector
of
the
house,
the
homeowners'
own
choosing
at
his
own
time
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
government
intruding.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
it's
worth
working
a
little
bit
to
protect
this
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
it
could
be
done.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
perhaps
not.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
the
court
could
merely
say
that
a
warrant
is
required
and
then
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
court
could
merely
say
that
a
warrant
is
required
and
none
was
even
applied
for
here.
so,
i
don't
have
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
routine
search
would
not
be
sufficient
for
a
warrant.
no
warrant
was
even
applied
for
here.
so
i
don't
need
to
go
as
far
as
i'm
gone.
i
feel
that
i
must
go
this
far
because
it
is
the
fourth
amendment
in
my
opinion.
and
if
the
opinions
of
this
court
say
that
that's
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
all
with
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
we've
done
that
in
our
brief.
we've
said
in
any
event
this
case
is
distinguishable
for
frank
versus
maryland
because
there
was
no
probable
cause
of
any
indication
of
something
needing
inspection.
this
was
merely
a
man
who
wanted
to
go
in
the
house
for
a
reason
which
has
never
been
determined.
the
only
reason
being
that
he
said
is
that
he
was
living
there
which
was
an
admitted
fact.
so
this
is
quite
different
from
frank
versus
maryland.
we've
done
that
in
our
briefs
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
exactly
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
exactly
the
exact
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
we
would
say
that
the
other
is
the
statutory
writ
of
assistance
which
the
history
of
this
country
outlaws.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
for
routine
inspections,
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
so
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh,
may
i
ask
for
five
minutes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
this
is
a
health
inspector
case
and
involves
with
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
is
the
vexing
an
important
problem
which
has
been
with
us
for
a
long
time.
the
appellant
in
this
case
believes
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
more
than
written
of
mere
words.
it
was
written
of
the
long
experience
of
the
colonists
under
the
english
rule
in
framing
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
written
as
its
very
word
state
to
protect
the
security
of
the
citizens
and
residents
of
this
country.
it
was
not
meant
to
be
a
nose
of
wax
to
be
twisted
to
the
convenience
of
petty
government
officials.
this
case
arose
when
an
official
wish
to
inspect
the
apartment
of
the
appellant
because
he
had
learned
that
the
appellant
was
living
in
an
apartment
which
he
did
not
believe
was
covered
by
a
certificate
of
occupancy
in
an
apartment
house.
he
went
to
the
appellant,
asked
him
whether
he
as
living
in
this
apartment,
the
appellant
said,
“yes,
he
was”.
the
health
inspector
then
said,
“may
i
come
in
and
inspect.”
the
answer
was,
“do
you
have
a
warrant?
do
you
have
a
complaint?”
the
answers
to
both
of
those
questions
were,
“no.
this
is
a
routine
inspection.”
and
it
was
a
routine
inspection,
permission
was
denied.
again,
the
health
inspector
came
back
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
appellee
claims
that
that
was
the
power
that
the
inspector
was
pursuing
at
the
time,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
there
was
no
complaint
at
all.
the
only
reason
which
has
ever
been
offered
is
that
the
apartment
may
not
have
been
the
covered
by
the
certificate
of
occupancy
but
that
was
sufficiently
answered
when
the
appellant
said,
"yes,
i
do
live
here".
and
then
the
inspector
came
back
two
more
times
and
on
the
second
--
third
visit,
november
22nd,
1963
in
the
afternoon,
the
inspector
again
required
--
said
that
he
wanted
to
enter
the
apartment.
it
was
denied,
permission
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
and
for
this
offense
on
november
22nd,
the
appellant
was
charged
with
a
crime.
we
attempted
to
prohibit
that
crime
through
california
procedures
in
the
california
courts
but
that
prohibition
proceeding
did
not
succeed
because
the
courts
below
relied
on
frank
versus
maryland.
now,
the
inspection
was
done
under
section
503
of
the
san
francisco
municipal
code
which
provides
that
any
city
employee
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
may
inspect
any
premises
at
reasonable
times
as
long
as
he
is
performing
his
duties.
you
will
note
that
the
statute
does
not
require
any
warrant.
it
does
not
require
any
probable
cause.
it
was
--
it
does
not
require
any
complaint
and
no
appointment
is
necessary.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
it
says
any
city
official
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
it's
not
limited
in
any
way.
although,
it
is
a
part
of
the
municipal
code
the
--
however,
i
would
point
out
that
the
municipal
code
does
contain
criminal
sections
which
punish
certain
acts
as
crimes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
they
haven't.
in
all
fairness
i
should
say,
that
i
know
of
no
instance
where
a
policeman
on
his
own
in
searching
for
some
criminal
evidence
has
used
this
statute
as
you
say
the
wording
of
the
statute
as
any
city
employee
and
certainly
the
policeman
are
city
employees.
as
of
yet,
no
policeman
has
tried
to
use
this
section
to
my
knowledge.
we
have
no
guarantee
that
they
wouldn't
try
it.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
welfare
department
has
not
tried
to
use
this
section
but
we
certainly
maintain
and
there
is
a
case
in
california
called
the
parrish
versus
alameda
county
where
the
welfare
department
does
claim
the
right
to
come
in
to
people
receiving
welfare
and
inspect
to
see
if
the
regulations
are
being
followed.
and
we
think
that
if
this
case
should
be
affirmed
that
the
welfare
people
would
certainly
take
advantage
of
it
as
well
as
property
tax
people,
urban
development
people,
anyone
who
thought
that
they
had
a
reasonable
interest
in
coming
into
a
home.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
just
mentioned
it.
we
don't
--
we
cite
the
parrish
case.
we
don't
discuss
it
fully.
we
mentioned
these
examples
that
there
and
--
now,
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
none
your
--
none
at
all.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
then
section
507
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
makes
it
a
crime
punishable
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
by
six
months
in
prison.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
there
are
criminal
violations
under
that
code
and
policemen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
would
doubt
it
and
we
don't
claim
that
the
police
are
using
this
to
search
for
narcotics,
peddlers
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
but
the
--
the
why
--
the
reason
i
asked
--
answered
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
the
way
i
did
is
that
this
case
obviously
is
going
to
be
setting
the
trend
for
all
such
inspections.
and
now
under
the
law,
if
a
health
inspector
is
allowed
to
come
in
without
a
warrant
certainly
welfare
inspectors,
property
tax
people,
other
people
interested
in
performing
their
duties
officiously
are
not
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh,
i
don't
think
the
elevator
inspector
is
an
example
which
causes
me
any
trouble
because
there's
a
public
building
and
each
elevator
is
licensed.
and
we
would
contend
that
the
elevator
inspector
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
look
at
this
license
premises
to
determine
whether
it's
safe.
and
we
contend
that
the
health
inspector
has
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
public
areas
of
an
apartment
house.
the
fire
inspector
can
look
at
the
fire
escapes.
it
is
only
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
the
private
area
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
that
the
reason
that
he
can't
without
a
warrant
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
people
shall
be
secure
in
their
homes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh!
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
because
this
is
the
business
premises
open
to
the
public
and
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
this
is
premises
to
the
extent
that
they're
not
open
to
the
public
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
persons,
papers,
effects
and
houses.
now,
whether
the
business
premises
come
within
those
words
or
not
is
a
question
we
don't
need
to
answer.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
there
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
there
are
protections
for
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
he's
protected
in
the
private
areas
but
i
don't
think
that
if
--
this
court
has
decided
that
if
a
man
holds
out
his
premises
open
to
the
public
that
he
can
object
because
a
policeman
walks
in
or
because
a
health
inspector
walks
in.
those
people
have
the
right
to
enter
just
as
any
other
member
of
the
public
or
the
premises'
license
such
as
a
restaurant.
it
has
to
maintain
its
license
and
as
a
condition
of
that
license
submits
to
inspection
which
all
restaurants
and
other
places
do.
then
the
inspectors
may
come
in
but
homes,
apartments,
are
not
licensed
and
there
is
not
that
granting
of
consent.
now,
the
frank
case
is
of
course
extremely
important
here.
we
want
to
point
out
that
the
frank
case
was
decided
before
mapp
versus
ohio
and
the
frank
case
in
its
terminology
and
its
discussion
is
all
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
reasonableness.
we
think
that
mapp
versus
ohio
in
deciding
unequivocally
that
the
fourth
amendment
contains
the
exclusionary
rule
binding
on
the
states
changes
the
complexion
and
the
view
in
which
this
court
should
view
a
search
and
seizure
case
coming
from
the
state
courts.
we
think
now
that
there's
no
question
that
the
full
power
of
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
such
cases.
the
frank
case
found
two
kinds
of
security
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they
found
the
security
to
be
protected
against
the
search
for
criminal
evidence,
to
be
protected
by
the
warrant
procedure
but
it
said,
when
there's
no
specific
search
for
criminal
evidence
then
only
test
is
reasonableness
and
no
warrant
is
required.
that
was
the
dichotomy
drawn
by
frank.
we
don't
think
that
this
dichotomy
is
acceptable
anymore
now
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
fully
applicable
to
the
states.
but
we
point
out
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
limited
in
terms
in
any
distinction
between
a
criminal
search
and
a
noncriminal
search.
it
is
drafted
to
protect
security
and
does
not
mention
the
fourth
amendment.
does
not
mention
the
--
any
dichotomy
between
criminal
and
non
criminal.
it
is
true
that
when
we're
considering
what
effect
the
fifth
amendment
has
when
considered
with
the
fourth
amendment
then
we
consider
the
protection
against
self-incrimination
then
we
consider
the
criminal
elements
of
this.
there
is
no
historical
evidence
that
we
have
found
to
satisfy
the
idea
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
between
an
intrusion
into
ones
home
or
criminal
evidence
purposes
and
for
not
criminal
evidence
purposes.
both
are
intrusions.
both
i
think
were
objectionable
in
england
on
the
right
controversy
over
general
warrants
ensued
and
the
idea
in
england
as
it
should
be
here
today
in
america
is
that
warrants
are
required
for
all
such
intrusions.
the
colonist
had
experience
with
the
intrusion
of
government
officials
attempting
to
enforce
laws,
basically
smuggling
laws.
the
colonist
objected
and
i
would
say
that
john
adams
and
james
madison
objected
to
the
searches
of
homes
not
because
some
smuggled
goods
might
be
found
and
some
goods
might
be
forfeited
or
someone
might
be
convicted
of
a
crime
but
because
of
the
insult
that
the
intrusion
into
ones
home
causes.
the
insult
that
a
knock
on
the
door
is
a
statement
that
we
have
the
right
to
enter
and
you
don't
have
the
right
to
keep
us
out
and
we
don't
have
to
even
tell
you
if
there's
something
wrong
or
if
there's
some
complaint.
this
is
the
insult
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
what
the
claim
is,
yes.
but
the
particular
inspection
of
my
client's
apartment,
the
only
reason
given
is
because
the
apartment
may
not
have
been
covered
in
the
permit
of
occupancy
because
it
was
on
the
ground
floor
rather
than
on
the
second
or
third
floor.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
he
did
live
in
the
rear
of
the
store.
that's
what
he
told
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
the
inspector
and
that's
the
fact.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
sir.
i
don't.
i
think
that
it's
permissible
for
the
inspector
to
enter
the
common
areas
of
the
apartment
house
such
as
the
hallways
and
the
fire
escapes
which
are
open
to
anyone
to
contact
the
manager
to
see
that
his
license
is
being
enforced.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
home
is
that
bastion
of
privacy
which
not
only
the
framers
of
the
fourth
amendment
meant
to
protect
but
that
we
must
protect
to
preserve
the
security
and
privacy
which
is
so
significant
today,
the
home,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
that
was
a
separate
apartment
and
there's
no
dis
--
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
anyone
can
enter
that
place
of
business.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
door
was
open.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
he
was
selling
books
there.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
some
emergency
or
something
of
that
sort,
yes.
and
there
was
a
distinction
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
objection
to
the
health
officer's
presence
came
when
he
demanded
to
enter
the
resident's
part
of
the
appellant's
premises.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
first
of
all,
the
procedure
of
the
health
inspectors
would
be
to
seek
consent
and
we
think
that
he
should
seek
consent.
not
only
should
he
seek
consent
but
he
should
educate
the
public
as
to
the
value
of
his
inspection
as
to
what
he
is
doing.
he
should
let
people
know
in
advance
that
he
will
be
there
and
this
will
induce
consent
on
the
part
of
many
people.
and
now,
if
there
are
--
then
people
who
resists,
the
question
comes,
is
there
sufficient
facts
to
give
to
a
magistrate
under
oath
so
that
the
magistrate
may
issue
a
search
warrant
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
allow
the
inspection
of
that
premises.
a
search
warrant
would
describe
the
premises
to
be
searched,
what
was
being
searched
for.
it
wouldn't
be
just
a
knock
on
the
door,
an
unexpected
knock
on
the
door.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
i
think
under
that
situation,
any
house
in
any
city
could
be
inspected
because
there
is
at
least
one
rat
in
every
city,
if
not,
many
more.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
it
could
be
in
--
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
in
my
judgment,
there
must
be
probable
cause
under
oath
given
to
a
magistrate
that
there
are
some
reason
to
inspect
these
premises.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
of
course,
that's
a
factual
thing
mainly
to
be
balanced
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
by
the
magistrate.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
it
comes
out
of
the
house
and
if
the
health
inspector
can
say
when
we
see
a
rat
coming
out
of
the
house,
we
know
that
they're
likely
to
be
more
that
there
are
--
that
these
creates
health
problems
then,
yes.
one
rat
could
be
sufficient.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
one
rat
per
house?
i
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
think
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
alright.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
would
first
have
to
go
and
see
if
they
could
make
this
inspection
on
the
basis
of
consent
which
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
alright,
they
had
two
blocks
and
now
--
then
they
would
go
to
a
magistrate
and
they
would
say
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
would
say
depending
on
the
facts.
if
they
said,
we
know
that
there
are
rats
in
this
neighborhood.
we've
seen
them
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
then
that's
not
sufficient
justice
stewart.
that's
just
the
mere
suspicion
and
they
could
search
--
they
could
say
that
there
might
be
rats
in
any
home
and
any
one
of
our
homes
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
could
be
searched.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
could
not.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
could
not.
i'm
not
saying
that
they
couldn't
inspect.
they
couldn't
get
a
warrant
for
more
than
one
house
because
they
might
have
probable
cause
for
more
than
one
house.
but
they
could
not
search
on
the
basis
of
mere
suspicion
without
facts.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
that
--
it
is
in
our
position
that
that
is
not
probable
cause.
that
is
mere
authority
to
make
an
inspection
without
probable
cause.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
i
think
the
probable
cause
must
be
specified
as
something
specific
as
to
this
home
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
or
these
group
of
homes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
unless
they
can
show
some
peculiar
thing.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
now,
i
would
just
want
to
mention
that
in
the
long
history
of
search
and
seizure
cases
under
this
court
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i
have
to
find
--
if
i
don't
i
have
to
find
an
exception.
of
course,
there's
always
been
an
emergency
exception.
if
someone
is
yelling
fire
or
help
police,
the
fireman
or
the
policeman
may
enter.
if
there
is
that
emergency,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that
was
probably
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
before
my
day
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
they
get
a
warrant,
of
course
they
can
make
an
inspection
but
we
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
they
went
to
the
magistrate
and
they
said
we
have
a
bubonic
plague
outbreak
and
it's
likely
to
becoming
from
this
area
and
we
know
that
there
are
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
in
that
situation,
i
don't
think
they
could
get
a
warrant
allowing
them
to
inspect
every
home
in
the
city
unless
they
could
show
that
there's
some
specific
reason
why
every
home
in
the
city
should
be
inspected.
i
know
that's
an
extreme
example
and
you're
backing
me
to
the
wall
but
i
have
to
be
consistent
here
and
say
that
they
should
be
able
to
come
up
with
some
facts
that
they
can
give
an
affidavit
to
a
magistrate
and
if
they
can't
they're
not
very
good
health
inspectors
whether
the
facts
are
that
this
is
an
old
house
that
might
be
sufficient
in
a
bubonic
plague
situation.
and
because
rat
infester
and
old
houses
and
rats
carry
bubonic
plague,
i
think
any
good
health
inspector
worth
his
salt
could
get
a
warrant
and
be
able
to
give
facts
and
solve
that
situation.
i
don't
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
no
warrant
is
needed,
i
--
for
--
the
first
part
of
that
language
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
that's
what
it
implies.
i
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
would
disagree
with
--
i
know
and
--
i
would
disagree
with
that
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
that
violates
the
privacy
which
was
intended
to
be
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
the
opinion
of
the
appellant.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
pardon
me?
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i
don't
think
it
goes
far.
i
don't
think
it's
hard
to
get
probable
cause
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
if
they
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
certainly,
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
almost
impossible
to
answer.
each
case
must
come
up
on
its
own
facts.
in
this
case,
no
warrant
was
even
applied
for
and
the
government
is
claiming
the
right
to
go
in
without
even
applying
for
a
warrant.
i
think
that
the
standard
that
a
magistrate
would
use
in
judging
a
warrant
for
probable
cause
might
well
be
different
than
a
criminal
case
and
in
that
extent
i
agree
with
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i've
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
must
come
up
with
some
facts
justifying
an
inspection
of
this
specific
house
or
this
specific
small
individualized
area
and
these
must
be
particular
facts.
if
it
were
said
in
the
affidavit
that
these
homes
were
built
100
years
ago
similar
homes
are
deteriorating
that
may
be
sufficient
factual
allegations
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
i
would
say
that
that
the
magistrate
has
--
would
have
no
sworn
facts
before
him
indicating
that
the
wiring
in
this
house
was
in
any
way
defective.
if
you
give
me
a
little
more
facts
if
you
say
that
the
health
officer
or
the
electrical
inspector
was
able
to
allege
that
this
house
was
50
years
old
and
that
the
wiring
is
50
years
old
that
may
be
sufficient.
let
me
throw
out
one
more
thing
because
i
think
it's
important.
i
think
there
are
alternatives
for
the
various
situations
you
suggest.
i
think
of
the
city
is
concerned
about
wiring,
it
could
require
an
affirmative
obligation
which
wouldn't
invade
privacy
that
is
that
each
householder
get
a
certificate
of
compliance
with
current
standards
of
wiring.
and
that
would
be
done
by
a
licensed
inspector
of
the
house,
the
homeowners'
own
choosing
at
his
own
time
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
government
intruding.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
it's
worth
working
a
little
bit
to
protect
this
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
it
could
be
done.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
perhaps
not.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
the
court
could
merely
say
that
a
warrant
is
required
and
then
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
the
court
could
merely
say
that
a
warrant
is
required
and
none
was
even
applied
for
here.
so,
i
don't
have
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
routine
search
would
not
be
sufficient
for
a
warrant.
no
warrant
was
even
applied
for
here.
so
i
don't
need
to
go
as
far
as
i'm
gone.
i
feel
that
i
must
go
this
far
because
it
is
the
fourth
amendment
in
my
opinion.
and
if
the
opinions
of
this
court
say
that
that's
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
all
with
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
we've
done
that
in
our
brief.
we've
said
in
any
event
this
case
is
distinguishable
for
frank
versus
maryland
because
there
was
no
probable
cause
of
any
indication
of
something
needing
inspection.
this
was
merely
a
man
who
wanted
to
go
in
the
house
for
a
reason
which
has
never
been
determined.
the
only
reason
being
that
he
said
is
that
he
was
living
there
which
was
an
admitted
fact.
so
this
is
quite
different
from
frank
versus
maryland.
we've
done
that
in
our
briefs
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
exactly
the
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
exactly
the
exact
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
we
would
say
that
the
other
is
the
statutory
writ
of
assistance
which
the
history
of
this
country
outlaws.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
for
routine
inspections,
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
so
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh,
may
i
ask
for
five
minutes
mr.
chief
justice.
