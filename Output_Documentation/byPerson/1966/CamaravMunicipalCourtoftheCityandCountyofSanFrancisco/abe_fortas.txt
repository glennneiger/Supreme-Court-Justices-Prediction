justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'd
like
to
know
what
if
any
sort
of
entry
as
you
believe
would
be
permit
--
constitutionally
permissible
under
this
ordinance.
you
started
talking
about
that.
now
this
particular
inspection
wasn't
it
annual
--
apartment
houses
inspection
for
the
purpose
of
issuing
an
occupancy
license,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
a
store
on
the
ground
floor
of
this
apartment
building
and
the
claim
was
that
your
client
lived
in
the
rear
of
the
store,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
now,
do
you
believe
that
its
cons
--
it
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
for
the
inspector
to
enter
this
apartment
building
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
would
confine
this
to
areas
to
which
the
public
does
not
have
access.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
on
the
ground
floor
there
was
a
store
and
that
--
the
rear
of
that
store
as
i
understand
the
fact,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
was
being
used
as
your
client's
home.
justice
abe
fortas
now
would
you
--
you
would
--
you'd
have
no
difficultly
with
the
proposition
that
the
inspector
could
enter
your
client's
place
of
business?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
that
when
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
when
the
inspector
demand
a
warrant
to
enter
the
rear
of
the
store
which
is
being
used
as
residence
by
your
client
then
he
needed
either
a
warrant
or
a
some
probable
cause,
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
rat
infestation
survey
were
being
made
of
the
four
square
block
area
and
let
say,
in
your
judgment,
would
it
be
necessary
for
the
inspector
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
applicable
to
each
house
in
that
area?
justice
abe
fortas
in
my
situation,
the
police
officer
could
--
only
could
say
is
that
he's
searching
for
migratory
rats?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
this
was
a
--
there's
confusion
here,
in
the
briefs
too
as
i
read
them.
i
thought
that
the
--
that
there
was
a
violation
here
because
the
terms
of
the
license
restricted
the
ground
floor
to
commercial
purposes.
and
the
inspector
went
into
the
ground
floor
and
mr.
camara
said,
“yes,
that's
true.
i
live
in
the
back
of
this
which
is
a
violation".
i
didn't
know
that
there
was
anything
beyond
that
involved
in
this
case.
now,
you're
telling
us
that
there
was
a
reason
for
the
inspector
to
go
onto
the
back
room
which
was
to
find
our
whether
there
were
some
other
violations?
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
a
violation?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
see
any
--
maybe
i
missed
it
but
i
don't
remember
any
reference
in
your
brief
to
the
health
and
--
provision
or
whatever
other
provision
it
is
you
refer
us
to
the
section
86
part
3
requiring
an
inspection
at
least
once
a
year
from
apartment
houses
for
the
purposes
of
the
occupancy
permit.
now,
are
you
telling
us
that
there
is
some
other
substantive
provision
that's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
number
one,
is
there
anything
--
is
there
a
reference
in
your
brief
something
else?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
read
your
brief,
i
thought
that
all
you
were
saying
was
that
the
reason
that
you
were
seeking
the
inspection
right
here
was
this
occupancy
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
clear
from
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
brief
--
it's
clear
from
your
brief
that
the
purposes
of
the
occupancy
permit,
your
ordinances
do
provide
for
routine
inspection.
and
i
would
want
to
see
if
there
were
some
other
purpose
of
the
inspection
here.
i
would
like
to
see
exactly
what
your
code
requires
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
whether
that
--
and
i'd
like
to
know
whether
mr.
camara
was
told
that
the
inspector
wants
to
get
in
this
--
for
some
purpose
other
than
the
occupancy
permit
inspection.
justice
abe
fortas
i
assume
there
is
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
and,
well
i
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
for
what
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no,
no.
justice
abe
fortas
no.
let's
be
a
little
careful
if
you
don't
mind.
there
--
the
only
provision
that
i
know
of
that
i
have
seen
in
your
brief
providing
for
once
a
year
inspection
relates
to
the
permit
of
occupancy.
now,
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
we
have
to
--
are
you
--
the
questions
going
through
my
mind
is
whether
you're
saying
that
even
if
the
inspector
is
obeying
as
to
the
reason
for
asking
for
access
he
still
has
a
right
of
access
without
obtaining
a
warrant
or
anything
else
or
let
me
put
it
another
way.
it's
possible
to
defend
the
right
of
access
here
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
routine
pursuant
to
a
plan
that
is
set
forth
in
the
city
ordinances
indistinct
from
the
--
mr.
justice
harlan
was
making.
it's
also
possible
to
argue
that
it's
defensible
even
if
it
is
sort
of
(inaudible)
or
haphazard
without
being
pursuant
to
a
plan
that's
set
forth
in
the
ordinances.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
inspection
that
is
being
made
is
uncertain
or
ambiguous
or
sort
of
a
roving
commission.
and
i
think
that
may
have
some
bearing
upon
the
constitutional
question
that
we
have
under
--
they're
wrong
about
it.
but
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
specific
questions
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
i
am
putting
you
now
is
this,
its
a
matter
of
fact
in
your
brief
as
i
read
it,
there
is
an
attempt
to
defend
this
particular
inspection
only
as
i
read
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
part
of
an
annual
inspection
provided

with
purposes
of

kinds
of
permit
of
occupancy.
now

if
there
is
anything
--
if
there
was
any
other
purpose
to
be
served,
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
is,
number
one.
and
number
two,
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
petitioner
here,
mr.

was
advised
of
the
other
purpose?
justice
