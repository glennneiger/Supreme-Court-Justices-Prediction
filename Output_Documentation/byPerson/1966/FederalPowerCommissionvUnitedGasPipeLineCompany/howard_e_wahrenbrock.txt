mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
bring
before
the
court
a
decision
setting
aside
a
rate
reduction
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
commission
reduced
the
rates
of
the
united
gas
pipeline
because
so
far
as
is
here
involved,
united
gas
pipeline
had
estimated
its
rates
upon
the
basis
of
the
inclusion
of
an
allowance
for
federal
income
taxes
based
upon
the
usual
corporate
statutory
rate
of
52%
it
applied
--
would
apply
if
united
filed
a
separate
return
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
united
joins
with
its
affiliates
in
filing
a
consolidated
return.
and
under
the
consolidated
return,
the
total
tax
for
the
group
is
less
than
the
total
of
the
separate
return
taxes
because
some
of
the
group
particularly
united's
producing
affiliate
union
regularly
enjoys
tax
losses
and
those
tax
losses
have
to
be
absorbed
by
some
of
the
taxable
income
of
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
group
and
as
a
result
of
that
absorption,
the
group
tax
is
less.
these
lawsuits
result
from
the
fact
that
union
enjoys
the
special
deductions
that
most
oil
and
gas
producers
enjoy.
i
refer
to
the
provision
for
the
expend
thing
of
productive
well
intangible
drilling
costs
and
the
provision
for
depletion
at
the
statutory
percentage
of
income.
union
is
in
fact
highly
profitable
over
at
the
five-year-period
for
which
tax
information
is
particularly
irrelevant
here;
its
net
income
have
reached
$14
million
a
year.
the
commission
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
it
participated
only
one
--
in
only
one
of
these
five
years
and
had
a
$25,000.00
loss
which
is
negligible
for
these
purposes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
the
producing
company's
average
tax
loss
over
the
five-year-period
was
$800,000.00
a
year.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
all
of
the
companies
had
taxable
income
and
in
one
year
union
itself
had
taxable
income.
in
one
year,
no
other
company
other
than
united
gas
pipeline
had
taxable
income.
they
all
had
losses
in
one
year.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
on
the
average,
it
has
an
$800,000.00
a
year
of
loss.
there
are
occasionally
were
losses
by
other
companies.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
sources
of
the
loss
are
these
two
provisions
for
deduction
of
intangible
drilling
cost
and
statutory
depletion.
the
rates
were
here
tested
by
the
commission
and
new
rates
fixed
upon
the
basis
of
the
so-called
cost
of
service
method
that
the
commission
has
used
since
rates
fixed
by
that
method
were
first
approved
by
this
court
in
the
hope
case
in
the
1940's.
under
that
method,
the
commission
determines
the
average
unit
cost
of
service
on
the
basis
of
the
business
done
in
the
test
year
including
a
fair
return
on
the
amount
prudently
invested
in
the
business
after
income
tax.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
the
regulated
business,
the
business
for
which
the
rates
are
regulated.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
we
make
--
if
our
company
has
both
regulated
and
unregulated
business
there
has
to
be
an
apportionment.
because
of
the
year
to
year
variations
in
the
level
of
taxes
paid
on
this
consolidated
return,
the
commission
looked
to
taxes
not
only
for
the
test
year
but
for
a
representative
period
of
years,
five
years
and
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
period
of
years
from
1957
to
1961
that
the
commission
used
was
a
representative
period
for
that
purpose.
the
commission
determined
united
share
in
the
consolidated
return
taxes
for
those
five
years
in
this
manner
it
divided
the
group's
total
taxes
for
the
five-year-period
by
five
to
determine
the
average
consolidated
tax
paid
by
the
group
in
each
of
those
--
over
that
five-year-period.
and
it
allocated
a
proportionate
part
of
that
average
consolidated
tax
to
united
on
the
basis
of
united's
--
the
relationship
of
united's
taxable
income
on
a
separate
return
to
the
total
taxable
incomes
on
separate
returns
that
united
was
92.11%
of
the
total,
92%
produced
the
share
that
was
allocated
to
united
and
the
commission
determined
that
that
share
amounted
to
50.04%
of
united's
taxable
income
on
a
separate
return.
and
therefore,
it
estimated
that
over
the
future
years
for
which
this
rate
would
in
effect,
united
as
a
participant
in
the
consolidated
return
would
have
to
pay
taxes
that
could
be
estimated
on
the
basis
of
this
past
experience
at
this
--
as
an
effective
consolidated
return
rate
that
united's
taxes
would
in
effect
be
50.04%
instead
of
what
its
rate
would
be
on
a
separate
return
basis
52%.
and
using
that
as
an
estimate,
the
result
was
that
the
rate
--
rates
the
commission
fixed
in
effect
allowed
united
for
every
50
cents
of
return,
50.04
cents
for
income
taxes.
not
less,
because
the
company
is
entitled
to
the
fair
return,
the
intended
fair
return
after
taxes
not
more
because
the
rate
payers
entitled
to
the
lowest
reasonable
rate.
it
was
this
apportionment
that
the
court
below
set
aside
said
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
power,
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
make
such
an
apportionment.
it
did
this
by
a
short
per
curiam
opinion
and
which
have
attempted
no
rationalization
of
its
own
but
referred
to
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
city
service
case
that
have
been
decided
in
october
of
1964,
and
said
that
the
principles
of
that
decision
were
applicable
in
controlling
here.
the
tenth
circuit
had
said
that
the
52%
a
tax
upon
the
regulated
company
at
52%
represented
its
actual
tax
liability
that
the
consolidated
return
reduction
is
due
to
the
tax
losses
of
the
loss
companies
ignoring
any
need
that
those
losses
be
absorbed
before
there
can
be
a
reduction.
and
that
is
said
that
to
apportion
any
part
of
the
--
to
the
regulated
company
of
the
tax
reduction
is
to
assign
to
it
the
tax
consequences
of
profits
or
losses
as
the
case
may
be
of
other
businesses
other
than
the
business
of
his
being
regulated
and
said
that
that
transgress
the
jurisdictional
limits
congress
had
imposed
upon
the
power
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
the
petitions
for
certiorari
in
this
case
presented
only
the
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
make
an
apportionment
not
any
question
of
the
commission's
--
the
method
of
apportionment
that
had
not
been
commented
upon
by
either
of
the
court's
all
that
had
--
the
really
been
litigated
objected
to
before
the
commission
or
the
court
below
and
certainly
all
that
have
decided
was
that
the
commission
did
not
have
power
and
i
shall
therefore
confine
my
argument
to
the
question
of
power.
the
assumption
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
applied
to
the
regulated
business
a
tax
rate
which
represented
what
this
experience
over
the
pass
year
of
five
years
had
shown
was
the
effect
of
allocating
a
share
to
united
of
the
total
affiliated
group's
tax
payment.
now,
the
assumption
that
there
is
anything
actual
about
a
52%
tax
liability
for
united
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
is
simply
wrong.
the
only
source
of
any
tax
liability
is
of
course
the
internal
revenue
code
and
when
a
consolidated
return
is
filed,
the
internal
revenue
code
is
as
explicit
as
language
can
be
that
there
is
only
one
liability
--
liability
for
the
tax,
for
the
consolidated
group.
each
member
of
the
consolidated
group
is
liable
for
that
total
tax.
the
parent
corporation
under
the
internal
revenue
regulations,
apparent
corporation
generally
acts
as
the
sole
agent
for
the
group
making
filing
the
returns
and
dealing
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
there
is
nowhere
in
the
code,
any
provision
for
any
lesser
tax
liability
than
the
total
group
tax
liability
and
the
code
is
explicit
that
there
may
be
no
contract
entered
into
among
or
by
among
the
members
of
the
consolidated
group
or
with
anyone
else,
that
affects
alters
or
affects
that
total
liability
or
that
liability
so
imposed
in
any
manner.
now,
there
is
no
expressed
contention
in
this
case
that
i
know
of,
that
the
internal
revenue
code
or
the
regulations
do
not
make
that
consolidated
tax
liability
a
joint
tax
cost
on
all
members,
but
two
claims
are
made
that
it
is
not
a
joint
cost
that
are
in
direct
conflict
with
the
code
provisions
as
well
as
effectuate
erroneous
and
i
want
to
take
up
those
two-principle
plans.
a
witness
for
united
testified
that
the
producing
company
union
could've
absorbed
these
losses
out
of
its
own
taxable
incomes
it
if
--
it
itself
have
filed
separate
return.
union
and
one
of
these
five
years
had
taxable
income.
in
the
other
four
years
it
had
tax
losses,
on
the
average
its
tax
losses
exceeded
its
tax
--
taxable
income,
but
the
claim
is
made
that
if
it
could
use
on
a
separate
return
it's
carry
over
and
carry
back
provisions.
it
could
absorbed
its
own,
there
were
no
figures
put
in
to
support
that
claim.
the
only
figures
that
are
in
the
record
are
the
claims,
are
the
figure
showing
that
the
average
on
the
average
its
tax
losses
exceed
its
taxable
income
by
$800,000.00
a
year.
the
result
is
that
--
if
those
figures
are
representative
and
there's
no
question
that
they
are,
that
the
longer
you
carry
it
back
the
more
your
--
your
taxable
losses
exceed
your
taxable
income
or
the
longer
you
carry
it
forward.
so,
it
must
be
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
the
carry
back
and
carry
forward
would
not
enable
union
to
absorb
the
tax
losses.the
on
cross-examination
union's
witness
attempted
to
buttress
his
position.
he
said
union
could
change
its
method
of
doing
business,
it
could
sell
production
payments
and
thereby
anticipate
future
income,
a
new
side
income
realizing
its
income
immediately
to
absorb
its
losses
or
it
could
alter
its
well
drilling
program
to
avoid
incurring
excessive
losses
at
a
time
when
it
couldn't
absorb.
but
rates,
if
the
court
please
are
not
fixed
on
self-serving
speculations
as
to
alternative
ways
that
business
could
be
done
and
not
be
taxed
so
much
or
taxed
less.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
there
is
of
course
the
fact
that
they
have
elected
to
file
a
consolidated
return
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
they
have
elected
to
file
a
consolidated
return
presumably
because
that
means
that
it
is
beneficial
to
them
to
make
that
election.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
a
separate
return
the
regulated
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
a
separate
return,
the
regulated
company
would
have
higher
taxes
than
a
total
of
its
taxes
and
the
taxes
of
the
other
companies
on
a
separate
return
basis
would
be
higher
than
on
the
consolidated
basis
because
of
the
absorption
of
the
losses.
the
group
having
elected
this
method,
it
is
hardly
persuasive
for
it
now
to
say
when
its
rate
comes
under
scrutiny
that
it
could
have
achieved
the
same
benefit
by
filing
separate
returns
and
in
any
event,
what
might
have
been
true
on
separate
returns
is
irrelevant.
they
have
made
the
election
and
they
filed
a
consolidated
return.
the
other
claim
that
is
made
is
that
the
participation
and
the
consolidated
return
by
united
does
not
increase
the
consolidated
return
rate
reduction
and
this
is
attempted
to
be
demonstrated
by
a
table
that
is
set
forth
on
page
23
of
united's
brief,
that's
the
white
brief,
the
small
white,
the
square
bound
edge,
page
23.
now,
this
table
is
the
counterpart
of
a
table
that
appears
in
the
gas
--
city
service
opinion,
turn
it
to
facts
of
that
case,
such
a
table
can
be
made
wherever
over
the
period
of
years
for
which
taxes
are
being
scrutinized.
the
total
losses
of
the
group
can
be
absorb
by
some
--
by
the
taxable
income
of
the
group
without
including
the
taxable
income
of
the
regulated
company,
but
it
does
not
prove,
it
assumes
the
question
to
be
proved
is
to
what
justification
there
is
when
a
consolidated
return
is
filed
and
there
are
two
corporations
as
here,
gas
service
corporation
--
gas
corporation
and
united
both
of
whom
have
taxable
incomes.
what
reason
there
is
for
assuming
that
taxable
income
of
the
company
that
is
not
before
the
commission
is
the
taxable
income
that
absorbs
the
tax
losses?
the
group
can
turn
right
around
when
gas
corporation's
rates
are
under
review
in
the
states
of
texas
or
mississippi
or
louisiana
and
construct
the
counter
part
of
this
table
and
say
that
gas
corporation's
participation
in
the
group
was
not
necessary
because
united's
income
would've
absorb
it
all.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
any
reason
any
economical
justification
for
preferring
one
corporation,
one
taxable
income
corporation
over
another
taxable
income
corporation
to
use
that
one's
income
over
the
other
in
the
absorption
of
the
losses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
united
has
about
10
times
as
much
taxable
income
as
gas
service
corporation
on
the
average.
in
one
year,
gas
corporation,
the
state
regulated
corporation
has
had
no
taxable
income
so
in
that
year,
the
losses
of
union
had
to
be
absorbed
by
united's
because
under
the
code
and
the
regulations,
the
taxable
losses
must
be
absorbed
by
the
taxable
income
of
that
year
--
of
the
current
year
before
there
can
be
any
use
of
carry-back
or
carry-over.
in
another
year,
gas
corporation
had
some
taxable
income
but
not
merely
as
much
as
the
taxable
losses.
so,
that
in
true
of
the
five
years
that
were
representative,
gas
corporation
taxable
income
could
not
include
the
taxable
losses
of
that
year,
it
had
to
be
united's
that
absorbed
on
that
year
under
the
provisions
of
the
code.
the
table
therefore
which
assumes
the
question
to
be
answered
it
assumes
that
gas
corporation's
income
should
be
regarded
as
absorbing
the
tax
losses
is
just
a
reminder
of
the
old
carnival
game,
the
money
is
in
under
a
corporate
shell
you're
looking
at.
the
joint
nature
of
this
tax
cost
is
substantive
is
not
merely
formal.
the
purpose
of
the
code
provisions
that
produced
union's
tax
losses,
the
provisions
for
percent
of
income
depletion
and
for
the
expensing
of
intangible
well
drilling
cost,
congressional
purpose
in
making
those
provisions
it
is
well
established
is
to
encourage
the
exploration
and
development
of
oil
and
gas
properties.
the
relation
of
that
purpose
to
the
regulation
of
gas
rates,
under
the
natural
gas
act
has
been
eliminated
by
judge
tuttle's
opinion
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
el
paso
federal
power
commission
rate
case
in
1960.
judge
tuttle
there
began
by
noting
that
in
fixing
rates
the
return
on
investment
is
itself
fixed
high
enough
to
attract
additional
capital
for
necessary
expansion
to
the
business.
judge
tuttle
continued
this
does
not
mean
that
the
tax
savings
that
are
produced
by
intangible
well
drilling
and
statutory
depletion
provisions
are
to
constitute
a
profit
over
and
above
a
fair
rate
of
return,
because
the
congressional
purpose
of
these
tax
benefits
can
be
achieved
by
translating
them
into
reduced
rates
that
will
enable
more
gas
to
be
sold
in
competition
with
other
fuels
and
the
importance
to
united
gas
pipeline
of
competition
need
not
be
argued
because
it
was
argued
before
this
court,
this
term
by
united's
own
counsel,
mr.
woods
in
the
abandonment
case,
united
against
--
gas
pipeline
against
federal
power
commission.
when
mr.
woods
pointed
out
in
this
prime
--
a
slight
reflection
in
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
that
case
near
the
end,
mr.
woods
pointed
out
that
united
had
to
buy
its
gas
at
the
very
lowest
rate
it
could
buy
that
in
order
to
enable
it
to
continuance
to
maintain
its
sales
of
industrial
gas
in
the
market
against
competing
fuels.
now,
if
competition
is
that
important
to
united,
a
failure
to
translate
these
tax
benefits
into
reduced
rates
allowing
them
to
result
in
increasing
united's
rates
will
have
the
effect
of
constricting
the
marketability
of
the
gas.
the
marketability
of
the
gas
is
constricted.
it
will
be
impossible
for
pipeline's
to
show
the
necessary
marketability
and
the
economic
feasibility
of
expansions
and
without
expansions
these
tax
benefits
can
never
achieve
their
purpose
of
providing
an
incentive
that
will
successfully
encourage
exploration
and
development
because
there
will
not
be
the
demand
upon
the
part
of
pipelines
that
will
unable
that
--
will
make
that
attractive.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
element
that
i
understand
your
question
to
relate
to
his
the
tax
element
and
that
was
the
reason
instead
of
using
as
the
commission
usually
uses
a
test
year,
a
single
test
year
which
normally
in
the
case
of
the
normal
utility,
electric
utility
or
gas
pipeline
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
estimating
the
future,
the
commission
did
not
confined
itself
to
one
year
but
looked
to
five
and
there
was
no
question
in
this
case
that
that
is
representative.
now,
looking
to
five
years
it
fines
what
the
average
tax
was
--
and
because
of
there
were
these
variations
from
year
to
year
but
finding
that
five
years
was
representative
it
took
that
experience
that
effective
rate
of
50.04%
instead
of
52%.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
no
question,
no
case
and
which
the
commission
has
considered
that
question
and
decided
it.
the
el
paso
case
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
every
case,
the
commission
makes
an
allocation
of
cost
between
the
regulated
and
unregulated
business
and
then
the
hope
natural
gas,
the
colorado
interstate
case
which
was
decided
the
same
year
of
the
panhandle
case
that
has
been
cited
by
our
opponents
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
allocation
that
the
commission
made
by
the
usual
accounting
method
between
the
regulated
and
unregulated
business
of
the
single
corporation
was
all
that
was
necessary
that
that
satisfied
the
requirements
of
separating
regulated
and
unregulated
business.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
ever
have
a
what?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
the
mark
of
utility
earnings,
the
fixing
of
fair
return
is
to
allow
such
a
return
that
they
will
be
able
to
continue
in
business
and
to
continue
to
attract
back
capital.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we,
--
our
commission
has
had
no
experience
with
that.
there
have
been
trams
--
electric
speed
railways,
there
have
been
railroad
problems
that
i
think
provide
no
particular
answer
here.
the
importance
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
what
we
had
--
the
union
producing
company
itself
was
in
a
rate
case
before
the
commission.
it
was
decided
just
four
months
before
this
case
was
decided
by
the
commission
and
in
that
case,
inconsistently
with
the
claim
made
here
that
these
reductions
belong
to
the
loss
company
to
union.
union
didn't
there
concede
any
negative
tax.
union
in
fact
was
claiming
a
52%
tax
in
spite
of
the
fact
it
was
enjoying
tax
losses
every
year.
the
commission
allowed
it,
a
zero
tax
or
i
think
that
answers
your
honor's
question,
no
tax
because
it
wasn't
paying
any.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
has
all
of
its
cost
of
service
including
a
fair
return
on
its
investment
allowed
in
its
rates.
it
just
is
not
allowed
any
money
in
its
rates
for
taxes
that
it
doesn't
pay.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
losing
money
if
your
honor
please
here
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
these
are
tax
losses
not
real
losses.
now,
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
judge
tuttle's
observations
in
the
--
judge
tuttle's
observations
in
the
el
paso
case
are
particularly
relevant
here
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
consolidated
--
the
el
paso
case
did
not
involve
a
consolidated
return
because
el
paso
involves
in
a
single
corporate
entity
both
a
regulated
pipeline
system
like
united's
and
a
production
department
like
union
and
the
purpose
--
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
consolidated
return
is
to
enable
an
affiliated
group
of
corporations
constituting
an
economic
entity,
the
same
privileges
and
benefits
in
paying
their
taxes
as
though
they
were
a
single
corporation.
in
other
words,
the
purpose
of
the
consolidated
return
--
a
purpose
of
the
consolidated
return
is
to
enable
a
group
like
this
group
to
treat
its
tax
losses
the
same
way
it
would
if
it
were
single
corporation
such
as
el
paso
and
that
united
group
is
an
economic
entity
unified
economic
entity
we
discuss
a
great
length
in
our
brief.
i
just
here
want
to
quickly
point
out
that
these
corporations
are
united
by
100%
common
ownership
of
all
stock
and
debt,
long-term
debt
that
gas
corporation
obtains
96%
of
its
gas
supply
from
united
that
union
producing
company
sells
80%
of
its
output
of
gas
to
united
that
the
affiliation
of
the
companies
assures
that
there
will
be
a
continuation
of
this
relationship
and
that
united
will
continue
to
provide
a
market
for
union
as
union
seeks
to
expand
its
output
and
that
united
will
provide
a
supply
of
gas
for
gas
corporation
as
long
as
gas
corporation
continues
to
need
an
increasing
supply
and
that
united
will
have
its
ability
to
do
that
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
united
is
a
much
larger
corporation
than
either
of
these
two
that
it
has
much
larger
non-affiliated
supplies
and
much
larger
non-affiliated
markets
that
it
does
not
have
to
continue
to
supply
and
therefore
is
in
a
strong
position
to
continue
to
maintain
the
position
of
its
two
affiliates,
that
united
is
a
consistent
source
of
absorption
of
the
taxable
losses
of
the
affiliated
group
and
that
united
provides
the
vehicle
for
translating
these
tax
losses
not
utilized
by
union
itself
into
the
benefits
that
congress
intended
them
to
achieve.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
difference
there
was
a
difference
in
the
method
of
allocation
of
share
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have,
i
think
i
can
make
two
points
that
maybe
of
some
assistance
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
haven't
felt
that
more
was
called
for
but
it
runs
i
may
say
to
so
far
as
the
so-called
concession
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
runs
to
the
possibility
which
i
think
is
faced
in
every
case
in
which
an
allocation
has
to
be
made
that
the
application
of
that
allocation
of
that
method
of
allocation
in
new
cases
as
cases
come
along
may
present
problems.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
method
of
allocation
before
the
court
but
only
as
to
the
power
to
make
an
allocation
and
the
method
of
allocation
that
some
of
the
methods,
some
of
those
problems
it's
easy
to
speculate
may
arise
but
before
the
court
below
and
before
the
--
and
the
tenth
circuit
there
was
no
decision,
no
criticism
of
the
commission's
method
of
allocation.
many
of
the
statements
that
are
questioned
about
the
commission's
method
of
allocation
ran
to
division
between
regulated
and
non-regulated
business.
that
wasn't
passed
on
by
the
court
below,
wasn't
passed
on
in
the
tenth
circuit.
what
was
said
was
what
was
held
was
the
commission
does
not
have
power
to
allocate
a
portion
of
the
consolidated
return
tax
reduction
to
among
the
taxable
income
companies
so
that
the
regulated
company
gets
a
share
of
that.
now,
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
had
the
consideration
of
the
method.
there
has
been
no
decision
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
would
--
i
would
question
whether
that
question
was
preserved
in
--
so
that
it
could
be,
so
that
review
could
be
sought
of
it.
natural
gas
pipeline
came
the
closest
to
preserving
the
question.
but
natural
gas
pipeline's
only
interest
is
that
of
a
customer
and
as
it
says
in
its
brief
its
interest
is
in
reducing
rates.
and
this
is
a
reduction
that
it's
attacking
and
under
this
court's
decision,
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
phillips
case,
the
second
phillips
case
holding
that
suggesting
that
wisconsin
could
not
object
to
the
spiral
escalation
clauses
because
wisconsin
did
not
--
it
was
other
way
around,
california
could
not
object
to
the
spiral
escalation
clauses
because
they
affected
only
wisconsin
if
california
was
not
agreed.
though
we
say
natural
has
not
agreed
then
natural's
reservation
of
a
question
would
be
(inaudible).
in
other
words,
there
may
be
questions
on
remand
of
the
court
below
whether
anybody
can
raise
this
question
at
all
if
certainly
it
wasn't
passed
on.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
right.
that's
right.
now,
this
suggestion
of
--
well,
i
was
going
to
point
out
on
the
49%
versus
the
52%
but
mr.
justice
white
had
asked
about
our
brief
on
page
25
at
note
26
gives
the
record
references
and
on
the
percentage
that
was
actually
allocated
by
united
for
tax
purposes,
if
your
honor
please,
and
the
method
of
allocation
is
explained
on
page
--
on
the
joint
appendix
page
33
and
34.
the
method
of
allocation
is
described.
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
the
amount
that
they
among
themselves
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
allocate
for
the
tax
purpose
of
determining
whether
they
are
operating
at
a
profit
or
a
loss,
profits
and
earnings
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
tax,
there
is
only
a
single
tax
paid
and
that's
the
problem
that
recalls
for
the
allocation
with
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
sorry?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
record
citation
that
was
given
for
that
does
not
disclose
who
wrote
the
check.
it
does
say
that
this
company
wrote
a
check
for
the
amount
that
was
allocated
to
it
by
this
method
that
i
have
given
you
the
citation
for.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
says
that
the
check
was
written
to
the
government
but
that
couldn't
be
a
check
for
the
payment
of
the
total
tax
because
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
there
is
a
single
tax
liability
for
which
the
parent
corporation
is
responsible
for
filing
a
return
and
seeing
that
it
is
paid.
now,
i
suppose
it
can
handle
two
checks
of
five
checks
or
10.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
for
tax
purposes
for
determining
that's
what
1552
is
talking
about.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
but
that
is
not
the
method
that
they
did
follow.
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
alright.
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
i
understand
your
question
and
i
think
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
the
answer
grows
out
of
such
a
long
history
of
the
federal
power
commission's
no
profits
to
affiliates
rule
that
i
had
not
realized
that
was
involved.
these
--
such
a
payment
represents
an
adjustment
among
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
possibly
but
i'd
like
to
put
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'd
like
to
give
you
the
caveat
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
possibly,
if
the
commission
could
find
upon
the
facts
which
on
review
were
found
sufficient
to
support
its
finding
that
as
a
matter
of
prudent
management
the
affiliated
group
should
have
saved
the
utility
taxes
by
filing
a
consolidated
return
then
the
commission
might
find
that
they
had
not
acted
prudently
and
in
incurring
the
52%
tax
loss.
now,
this
is
purely
hypothetical
but
i
want
to
explain
my
caveat
in
answering
you.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
would
like
to
answer
yes
and
qualify
it
immediately
by
saying
it
would
not
have
that
effect
because
what
the
commission
allows
in
determining
cost
of
service
is
not
controlling
on
what
the
companies
may
do
for
their
other
purposes.
now,
we
are
dealing
here
with
one
of
an
affiliated
group
of
corporations
and
the
commission
will
not
allow
one
company
that
is
a
member
of
such
a
group
to
pay
as
a
tax,
a
payment
of
52%
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
group
does
not
incur
a
liability.
52%
of
which
is
properly
allocable
to
the
regulated
company.
an
affiliated
group
cannot
by
virtue
of
their
100%
affiliation
settle
the
regulated
company
with
more
cost
than
the
group
is
actually
incurring
upon
behalf
of
that
company.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
bring
before
the
court
a
decision
setting
aside
a
rate
reduction
by
the
federal
power
commission.
the
commission
reduced
the
rates
of
the
united
gas
pipeline
because
so
far
as
is
here
involved,
united
gas
pipeline
had
estimated
its
rates
upon
the
basis
of
the
inclusion
of
an
allowance
for
federal
income
taxes
based
upon
the
usual
corporate
statutory
rate
of
52%
it
applied
--
would
apply
if
united
filed
a
separate
return
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
united
joins
with
its
affiliates
in
filing
a
consolidated
return.
and
under
the
consolidated
return,
the
total
tax
for
the
group
is
less
than
the
total
of
the
separate
return
taxes
because
some
of
the
group
particularly
united's
producing
affiliate
union
regularly
enjoys
tax
losses
and
those
tax
losses
have
to
be
absorbed
by
some
of
the
taxable
income
of
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
group
and
as
a
result
of
that
absorption,
the
group
tax
is
less.
these
lawsuits
result
from
the
fact
that
union
enjoys
the
special
deductions
that
most
oil
and
gas
producers
enjoy.
i
refer
to
the
provision
for
the
expend
thing
of
productive
well
intangible
drilling
costs
and
the
provision
for
depletion
at
the
statutory
percentage
of
income.
union
is
in
fact
highly
profitable
over
at
the
five-year-period
for
which
tax
information
is
particularly
irrelevant
here;
its
net
income
have
reached
$14
million
a
year.
the
commission
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
it
participated
only
one
--
in
only
one
of
these
five
years
and
had
a
$25,000.00
loss
which
is
negligible
for
these
purposes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
the
producing
company's
average
tax
loss
over
the
five-year-period
was
$800,000.00
a
year.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
all
of
the
companies
had
taxable
income
and
in
one
year
union
itself
had
taxable
income.
in
one
year,
no
other
company
other
than
united
gas
pipeline
had
taxable
income.
they
all
had
losses
in
one
year.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
on
the
average,
it
has
an
$800,000.00
a
year
of
loss.
there
are
occasionally
were
losses
by
other
companies.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
sources
of
the
loss
are
these
two
provisions
for
deduction
of
intangible
drilling
cost
and
statutory
depletion.
the
rates
were
here
tested
by
the
commission
and
new
rates
fixed
upon
the
basis
of
the
so-called
cost
of
service
method
that
the
commission
has
used
since
rates
fixed
by
that
method
were
first
approved
by
this
court
in
the
hope
case
in
the
1940's.
under
that
method,
the
commission
determines
the
average
unit
cost
of
service
on
the
basis
of
the
business
done
in
the
test
year
including
a
fair
return
on
the
amount
prudently
invested
in
the
business
after
income
tax.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
the
regulated
business,
the
business
for
which
the
rates
are
regulated.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
we
make
--
if
our
company
has
both
regulated
and
unregulated
business
there
has
to
be
an
apportionment.
because
of
the
year
to
year
variations
in
the
level
of
taxes
paid
on
this
consolidated
return,
the
commission
looked
to
taxes
not
only
for
the
test
year
but
for
a
representative
period
of
years,
five
years
and
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
period
of
years
from
1957
to
1961
that
the
commission
used
was
a
representative
period
for
that
purpose.
the
commission
determined
united
share
in
the
consolidated
return
taxes
for
those
five
years
in
this
manner
it
divided
the
group's
total
taxes
for
the
five-year-period
by
five
to
determine
the
average
consolidated
tax
paid
by
the
group
in
each
of
those
--
over
that
five-year-period.
and
it
allocated
a
proportionate
part
of
that
average
consolidated
tax
to
united
on
the
basis
of
united's
--
the
relationship
of
united's
taxable
income
on
a
separate
return
to
the
total
taxable
incomes
on
separate
returns
that
united
was
92.11%
of
the
total,
92%
produced
the
share
that
was
allocated
to
united
and
the
commission
determined
that
that
share
amounted
to
50.04%
of
united's
taxable
income
on
a
separate
return.
and
therefore,
it
estimated
that
over
the
future
years
for
which
this
rate
would
in
effect,
united
as
a
participant
in
the
consolidated
return
would
have
to
pay
taxes
that
could
be
estimated
on
the
basis
of
this
past
experience
at
this
--
as
an
effective
consolidated
return
rate
that
united's
taxes
would
in
effect
be
50.04%
instead
of
what
its
rate
would
be
on
a
separate
return
basis
52%.
and
using
that
as
an
estimate,
the
result
was
that
the
rate
--
rates
the
commission
fixed
in
effect
allowed
united
for
every
50
cents
of
return,
50.04
cents
for
income
taxes.
not
less,
because
the
company
is
entitled
to
the
fair
return,
the
intended
fair
return
after
taxes
not
more
because
the
rate
payers
entitled
to
the
lowest
reasonable
rate.
it
was
this
apportionment
that
the
court
below
set
aside
said
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
power,
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
make
such
an
apportionment.
it
did
this
by
a
short
per
curiam
opinion
and
which
have
attempted
no
rationalization
of
its
own
but
referred
to
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
city
service
case
that
have
been
decided
in
october
of
1964,
and
said
that
the
principles
of
that
decision
were
applicable
in
controlling
here.
the
tenth
circuit
had
said
that
the
52%
a
tax
upon
the
regulated
company
at
52%
represented
its
actual
tax
liability
that
the
consolidated
return
reduction
is
due
to
the
tax
losses
of
the
loss
companies
ignoring
any
need
that
those
losses
be
absorbed
before
there
can
be
a
reduction.
and
that
is
said
that
to
apportion
any
part
of
the
--
to
the
regulated
company
of
the
tax
reduction
is
to
assign
to
it
the
tax
consequences
of
profits
or
losses
as
the
case
may
be
of
other
businesses
other
than
the
business
of
his
being
regulated
and
said
that
that
transgress
the
jurisdictional
limits
congress
had
imposed
upon
the
power
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
the
petitions
for
certiorari
in
this
case
presented
only
the
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
make
an
apportionment
not
any
question
of
the
commission's
--
the
method
of
apportionment
that
had
not
been
commented
upon
by
either
of
the
court's
all
that
had
--
the
really
been
litigated
objected
to
before
the
commission
or
the
court
below
and
certainly
all
that
have
decided
was
that
the
commission
did
not
have
power
and
i
shall
therefore
confine
my
argument
to
the
question
of
power.
the
assumption
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
applied
to
the
regulated
business
a
tax
rate
which
represented
what
this
experience
over
the
pass
year
of
five
years
had
shown
was
the
effect
of
allocating
a
share
to
united
of
the
total
affiliated
group's
tax
payment.
now,
the
assumption
that
there
is
anything
actual
about
a
52%
tax
liability
for
united
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
is
simply
wrong.
the
only
source
of
any
tax
liability
is
of
course
the
internal
revenue
code
and
when
a
consolidated
return
is
filed,
the
internal
revenue
code
is
as
explicit
as
language
can
be
that
there
is
only
one
liability
--
liability
for
the
tax,
for
the
consolidated
group.
each
member
of
the
consolidated
group
is
liable
for
that
total
tax.
the
parent
corporation
under
the
internal
revenue
regulations,
apparent
corporation
generally
acts
as
the
sole
agent
for
the
group
making
filing
the
returns
and
dealing
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
there
is
nowhere
in
the
code,
any
provision
for
any
lesser
tax
liability
than
the
total
group
tax
liability
and
the
code
is
explicit
that
there
may
be
no
contract
entered
into
among
or
by
among
the
members
of
the
consolidated
group
or
with
anyone
else,
that
affects
alters
or
affects
that
total
liability
or
that
liability
so
imposed
in
any
manner.
now,
there
is
no
expressed
contention
in
this
case
that
i
know
of,
that
the
internal
revenue
code
or
the
regulations
do
not
make
that
consolidated
tax
liability
a
joint
tax
cost
on
all
members,
but
two
claims
are
made
that
it
is
not
a
joint
cost
that
are
in
direct
conflict
with
the
code
provisions
as
well
as
effectuate
erroneous
and
i
want
to
take
up
those
two-principle
plans.
a
witness
for
united
testified
that
the
producing
company
union
could've
absorbed
these
losses
out
of
its
own
taxable
incomes
it
if
--
it
itself
have
filed
separate
return.
union
and
one
of
these
five
years
had
taxable
income.
in
the
other
four
years
it
had
tax
losses,
on
the
average
its
tax
losses
exceeded
its
tax
--
taxable
income,
but
the
claim
is
made
that
if
it
could
use
on
a
separate
return
it's
carry
over
and
carry
back
provisions.
it
could
absorbed
its
own,
there
were
no
figures
put
in
to
support
that
claim.
the
only
figures
that
are
in
the
record
are
the
claims,
are
the
figure
showing
that
the
average
on
the
average
its
tax
losses
exceed
its
taxable
income
by
$800,000.00
a
year.
the
result
is
that
--
if
those
figures
are
representative
and
there's
no
question
that
they
are,
that
the
longer
you
carry
it
back
the
more
your
--
your
taxable
losses
exceed
your
taxable
income
or
the
longer
you
carry
it
forward.
so,
it
must
be
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
the
carry
back
and
carry
forward
would
not
enable
union
to
absorb
the
tax
losses.the
on
cross-examination
union's
witness
attempted
to
buttress
his
position.
he
said
union
could
change
its
method
of
doing
business,
it
could
sell
production
payments
and
thereby
anticipate
future
income,
a
new
side
income
realizing
its
income
immediately
to
absorb
its
losses
or
it
could
alter
its
well
drilling
program
to
avoid
incurring
excessive
losses
at
a
time
when
it
couldn't
absorb.
but
rates,
if
the
court
please
are
not
fixed
on
self-serving
speculations
as
to
alternative
ways
that
business
could
be
done
and
not
be
taxed
so
much
or
taxed
less.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
there
is
of
course
the
fact
that
they
have
elected
to
file
a
consolidated
return
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
they
have
elected
to
file
a
consolidated
return
presumably
because
that
means
that
it
is
beneficial
to
them
to
make
that
election.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
a
separate
return
the
regulated
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
a
separate
return,
the
regulated
company
would
have
higher
taxes
than
a
total
of
its
taxes
and
the
taxes
of
the
other
companies
on
a
separate
return
basis
would
be
higher
than
on
the
consolidated
basis
because
of
the
absorption
of
the
losses.
the
group
having
elected
this
method,
it
is
hardly
persuasive
for
it
now
to
say
when
its
rate
comes
under
scrutiny
that
it
could
have
achieved
the
same
benefit
by
filing
separate
returns
and
in
any
event,
what
might
have
been
true
on
separate
returns
is
irrelevant.
they
have
made
the
election
and
they
filed
a
consolidated
return.
the
other
claim
that
is
made
is
that
the
participation
and
the
consolidated
return
by
united
does
not
increase
the
consolidated
return
rate
reduction
and
this
is
attempted
to
be
demonstrated
by
a
table
that
is
set
forth
on
page
23
of
united's
brief,
that's
the
white
brief,
the
small
white,
the
square
bound
edge,
page
23.
now,
this
table
is
the
counterpart
of
a
table
that
appears
in
the
gas
--
city
service
opinion,
turn
it
to
facts
of
that
case,
such
a
table
can
be
made
wherever
over
the
period
of
years
for
which
taxes
are
being
scrutinized.
the
total
losses
of
the
group
can
be
absorb
by
some
--
by
the
taxable
income
of
the
group
without
including
the
taxable
income
of
the
regulated
company,
but
it
does
not
prove,
it
assumes
the
question
to
be
proved
is
to
what
justification
there
is
when
a
consolidated
return
is
filed
and
there
are
two
corporations
as
here,
gas
service
corporation
--
gas
corporation
and
united
both
of
whom
have
taxable
incomes.
what
reason
there
is
for
assuming
that
taxable
income
of
the
company
that
is
not
before
the
commission
is
the
taxable
income
that
absorbs
the
tax
losses?
the
group
can
turn
right
around
when
gas
corporation's
rates
are
under
review
in
the
states
of
texas
or
mississippi
or
louisiana
and
construct
the
counter
part
of
this
table
and
say
that
gas
corporation's
participation
in
the
group
was
not
necessary
because
united's
income
would've
absorb
it
all.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
any
reason
any
economical
justification
for
preferring
one
corporation,
one
taxable
income
corporation
over
another
taxable
income
corporation
to
use
that
one's
income
over
the
other
in
the
absorption
of
the
losses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
united
has
about
10
times
as
much
taxable
income
as
gas
service
corporation
on
the
average.
in
one
year,
gas
corporation,
the
state
regulated
corporation
has
had
no
taxable
income
so
in
that
year,
the
losses
of
union
had
to
be
absorbed
by
united's
because
under
the
code
and
the
regulations,
the
taxable
losses
must
be
absorbed
by
the
taxable
income
of
that
year
--
of
the
current
year
before
there
can
be
any
use
of
carry-back
or
carry-over.
in
another
year,
gas
corporation
had
some
taxable
income
but
not
merely
as
much
as
the
taxable
losses.
so,
that
in
true
of
the
five
years
that
were
representative,
gas
corporation
taxable
income
could
not
include
the
taxable
losses
of
that
year,
it
had
to
be
united's
that
absorbed
on
that
year
under
the
provisions
of
the
code.
the
table
therefore
which
assumes
the
question
to
be
answered
it
assumes
that
gas
corporation's
income
should
be
regarded
as
absorbing
the
tax
losses
is
just
a
reminder
of
the
old
carnival
game,
the
money
is
in
under
a
corporate
shell
you're
looking
at.
the
joint
nature
of
this
tax
cost
is
substantive
is
not
merely
formal.
the
purpose
of
the
code
provisions
that
produced
union's
tax
losses,
the
provisions
for
percent
of
income
depletion
and
for
the
expensing
of
intangible
well
drilling
cost,
congressional
purpose
in
making
those
provisions
it
is
well
established
is
to
encourage
the
exploration
and
development
of
oil
and
gas
properties.
the
relation
of
that
purpose
to
the
regulation
of
gas
rates,
under
the
natural
gas
act
has
been
eliminated
by
judge
tuttle's
opinion
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
el
paso
federal
power
commission
rate
case
in
1960.
judge
tuttle
there
began
by
noting
that
in
fixing
rates
the
return
on
investment
is
itself
fixed
high
enough
to
attract
additional
capital
for
necessary
expansion
to
the
business.
judge
tuttle
continued
this
does
not
mean
that
the
tax
savings
that
are
produced
by
intangible
well
drilling
and
statutory
depletion
provisions
are
to
constitute
a
profit
over
and
above
a
fair
rate
of
return,
because
the
congressional
purpose
of
these
tax
benefits
can
be
achieved
by
translating
them
into
reduced
rates
that
will
enable
more
gas
to
be
sold
in
competition
with
other
fuels
and
the
importance
to
united
gas
pipeline
of
competition
need
not
be
argued
because
it
was
argued
before
this
court,
this
term
by
united's
own
counsel,
mr.
woods
in
the
abandonment
case,
united
against
--
gas
pipeline
against
federal
power
commission.
when
mr.
woods
pointed
out
in
this
prime
--
a
slight
reflection
in
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
that
case
near
the
end,
mr.
woods
pointed
out
that
united
had
to
buy
its
gas
at
the
very
lowest
rate
it
could
buy
that
in
order
to
enable
it
to
continuance
to
maintain
its
sales
of
industrial
gas
in
the
market
against
competing
fuels.
now,
if
competition
is
that
important
to
united,
a
failure
to
translate
these
tax
benefits
into
reduced
rates
allowing
them
to
result
in
increasing
united's
rates
will
have
the
effect
of
constricting
the
marketability
of
the
gas.
the
marketability
of
the
gas
is
constricted.
it
will
be
impossible
for
pipeline's
to
show
the
necessary
marketability
and
the
economic
feasibility
of
expansions
and
without
expansions
these
tax
benefits
can
never
achieve
their
purpose
of
providing
an
incentive
that
will
successfully
encourage
exploration
and
development
because
there
will
not
be
the
demand
upon
the
part
of
pipelines
that
will
unable
that
--
will
make
that
attractive.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
element
that
i
understand
your
question
to
relate
to
his
the
tax
element
and
that
was
the
reason
instead
of
using
as
the
commission
usually
uses
a
test
year,
a
single
test
year
which
normally
in
the
case
of
the
normal
utility,
electric
utility
or
gas
pipeline
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
estimating
the
future,
the
commission
did
not
confined
itself
to
one
year
but
looked
to
five
and
there
was
no
question
in
this
case
that
that
is
representative.
now,
looking
to
five
years
it
fines
what
the
average
tax
was
--
and
because
of
there
were
these
variations
from
year
to
year
but
finding
that
five
years
was
representative
it
took
that
experience
that
effective
rate
of
50.04%
instead
of
52%.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
no
question,
no
case
and
which
the
commission
has
considered
that
question
and
decided
it.
the
el
paso
case
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
every
case,
the
commission
makes
an
allocation
of
cost
between
the
regulated
and
unregulated
business
and
then
the
hope
natural
gas,
the
colorado
interstate
case
which
was
decided
the
same
year
of
the
panhandle
case
that
has
been
cited
by
our
opponents
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
allocation
that
the
commission
made
by
the
usual
accounting
method
between
the
regulated
and
unregulated
business
of
the
single
corporation
was
all
that
was
necessary
that
that
satisfied
the
requirements
of
separating
regulated
and
unregulated
business.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
ever
have
a
what?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
the
mark
of
utility
earnings,
the
fixing
of
fair
return
is
to
allow
such
a
return
that
they
will
be
able
to
continue
in
business
and
to
continue
to
attract
back
capital.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we,
--
our
commission
has
had
no
experience
with
that.
there
have
been
trams
--
electric
speed
railways,
there
have
been
railroad
problems
that
i
think
provide
no
particular
answer
here.
the
importance
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
what
we
had
--
the
union
producing
company
itself
was
in
a
rate
case
before
the
commission.
it
was
decided
just
four
months
before
this
case
was
decided
by
the
commission
and
in
that
case,
inconsistently
with
the
claim
made
here
that
these
reductions
belong
to
the
loss
company
to
union.
union
didn't
there
concede
any
negative
tax.
union
in
fact
was
claiming
a
52%
tax
in
spite
of
the
fact
it
was
enjoying
tax
losses
every
year.
the
commission
allowed
it,
a
zero
tax
or
i
think
that
answers
your
honor's
question,
no
tax
because
it
wasn't
paying
any.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
has
all
of
its
cost
of
service
including
a
fair
return
on
its
investment
allowed
in
its
rates.
it
just
is
not
allowed
any
money
in
its
rates
for
taxes
that
it
doesn't
pay.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
losing
money
if
your
honor
please
here
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
these
are
tax
losses
not
real
losses.
now,
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
judge
tuttle's
observations
in
the
--
judge
tuttle's
observations
in
the
el
paso
case
are
particularly
relevant
here
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
consolidated
--
the
el
paso
case
did
not
involve
a
consolidated
return
because
el
paso
involves
in
a
single
corporate
entity
both
a
regulated
pipeline
system
like
united's
and
a
production
department
like
union
and
the
purpose
--
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
consolidated
return
is
to
enable
an
affiliated
group
of
corporations
constituting
an
economic
entity,
the
same
privileges
and
benefits
in
paying
their
taxes
as
though
they
were
a
single
corporation.
in
other
words,
the
purpose
of
the
consolidated
return
--
a
purpose
of
the
consolidated
return
is
to
enable
a
group
like
this
group
to
treat
its
tax
losses
the
same
way
it
would
if
it
were
single
corporation
such
as
el
paso
and
that
united
group
is
an
economic
entity
unified
economic
entity
we
discuss
a
great
length
in
our
brief.
i
just
here
want
to
quickly
point
out
that
these
corporations
are
united
by
100%
common
ownership
of
all
stock
and
debt,
long-term
debt
that
gas
corporation
obtains
96%
of
its
gas
supply
from
united
that
union
producing
company
sells
80%
of
its
output
of
gas
to
united
that
the
affiliation
of
the
companies
assures
that
there
will
be
a
continuation
of
this
relationship
and
that
united
will
continue
to
provide
a
market
for
union
as
union
seeks
to
expand
its
output
and
that
united
will
provide
a
supply
of
gas
for
gas
corporation
as
long
as
gas
corporation
continues
to
need
an
increasing
supply
and
that
united
will
have
its
ability
to
do
that
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
united
is
a
much
larger
corporation
than
either
of
these
two
that
it
has
much
larger
non-affiliated
supplies
and
much
larger
non-affiliated
markets
that
it
does
not
have
to
continue
to
supply
and
therefore
is
in
a
strong
position
to
continue
to
maintain
the
position
of
its
two
affiliates,
that
united
is
a
consistent
source
of
absorption
of
the
taxable
losses
of
the
affiliated
group
and
that
united
provides
the
vehicle
for
translating
these
tax
losses
not
utilized
by
union
itself
into
the
benefits
that
congress
intended
them
to
achieve.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
difference
there
was
a
difference
in
the
method
of
allocation
of
share
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have,
i
think
i
can
make
two
points
that
maybe
of
some
assistance
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
haven't
felt
that
more
was
called
for
but
it
runs
i
may
say
to
so
far
as
the
so-called
concession
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
runs
to
the
possibility
which
i
think
is
faced
in
every
case
in
which
an
allocation
has
to
be
made
that
the
application
of
that
allocation
of
that
method
of
allocation
in
new
cases
as
cases
come
along
may
present
problems.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
method
of
allocation
before
the
court
but
only
as
to
the
power
to
make
an
allocation
and
the
method
of
allocation
that
some
of
the
methods,
some
of
those
problems
it's
easy
to
speculate
may
arise
but
before
the
court
below
and
before
the
--
and
the
tenth
circuit
there
was
no
decision,
no
criticism
of
the
commission's
method
of
allocation.
many
of
the
statements
that
are
questioned
about
the
commission's
method
of
allocation
ran
to
division
between
regulated
and
non-regulated
business.
that
wasn't
passed
on
by
the
court
below,
wasn't
passed
on
in
the
tenth
circuit.
what
was
said
was
what
was
held
was
the
commission
does
not
have
power
to
allocate
a
portion
of
the
consolidated
return
tax
reduction
to
among
the
taxable
income
companies
so
that
the
regulated
company
gets
a
share
of
that.
now,
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
had
the
consideration
of
the
method.
there
has
been
no
decision
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
would
--
i
would
question
whether
that
question
was
preserved
in
--
so
that
it
could
be,
so
that
review
could
be
sought
of
it.
natural
gas
pipeline
came
the
closest
to
preserving
the
question.
but
natural
gas
pipeline's
only
interest
is
that
of
a
customer
and
as
it
says
in
its
brief
its
interest
is
in
reducing
rates.
and
this
is
a
reduction
that
it's
attacking
and
under
this
court's
decision,
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
phillips
case,
the
second
phillips
case
holding
that
suggesting
that
wisconsin
could
not
object
to
the
spiral
escalation
clauses
because
wisconsin
did
not
--
it
was
other
way
around,
california
could
not
object
to
the
spiral
escalation
clauses
because
they
affected
only
wisconsin
if
california
was
not
agreed.
though
we
say
natural
has
not
agreed
then
natural's
reservation
of
a
question
would
be
(inaudible).
in
other
words,
there
may
be
questions
on
remand
of
the
court
below
whether
anybody
can
raise
this
question
at
all
if
certainly
it
wasn't
passed
on.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
right.
that's
right.
now,
this
suggestion
of
--
well,
i
was
going
to
point
out
on
the
49%
versus
the
52%
but
mr.
justice
white
had
asked
about
our
brief
on
page
25
at
note
26
gives
the
record
references
and
on
the
percentage
that
was
actually
allocated
by
united
for
tax
purposes,
if
your
honor
please,
and
the
method
of
allocation
is
explained
on
page
--
on
the
joint
appendix
page
33
and
34.
the
method
of
allocation
is
described.
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
the
amount
that
they
among
themselves
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
allocate
for
the
tax
purpose
of
determining
whether
they
are
operating
at
a
profit
or
a
loss,
profits
and
earnings
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
tax,
there
is
only
a
single
tax
paid
and
that's
the
problem
that
recalls
for
the
allocation
with
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
sorry?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
record
citation
that
was
given
for
that
does
not
disclose
who
wrote
the
check.
it
does
say
that
this
company
wrote
a
check
for
the
amount
that
was
allocated
to
it
by
this
method
that
i
have
given
you
the
citation
for.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
says
that
the
check
was
written
to
the
government
but
that
couldn't
be
a
check
for
the
payment
of
the
total
tax
because
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
there
is
a
single
tax
liability
for
which
the
parent
corporation
is
responsible
for
filing
a
return
and
seeing
that
it
is
paid.
now,
i
suppose
it
can
handle
two
checks
of
five
checks
or
10.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
for
tax
purposes
for
determining
that's
what
1552
is
talking
about.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
but
that
is
not
the
method
that
they
did
follow.
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
alright.
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
i
understand
your
question
and
i
think
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
the
answer
grows
out
of
such
a
long
history
of
the
federal
power
commission's
no
profits
to
affiliates
rule
that
i
had
not
realized
that
was
involved.
these
--
such
a
payment
represents
an
adjustment
among
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
possibly
but
i'd
like
to
put
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'd
like
to
give
you
the
caveat
on
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
possibly,
if
the
commission
could
find
upon
the
facts
which
on
review
were
found
sufficient
to
support
its
finding
that
as
a
matter
of
prudent
management
the
affiliated
group
should
have
saved
the
utility
taxes
by
filing
a
consolidated
return
then
the
commission
might
find
that
they
had
not
acted
prudently
and
in
incurring
the
52%
tax
loss.
now,
this
is
purely
hypothetical
but
i
want
to
explain
my
caveat
in
answering
you.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
would
like
to
answer
yes
and
qualify
it
immediately
by
saying
it
would
not
have
that
effect
because
what
the
commission
allows
in
determining
cost
of
service
is
not
controlling
on
what
the
companies
may
do
for
their
other
purposes.
now,
we
are
dealing
here
with
one
of
an
affiliated
group
of
corporations
and
the
commission
will
not
allow
one
company
that
is
a
member
of
such
a
group
to
pay
as
a
tax,
a
payment
of
52%
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
group
does
not
incur
a
liability.
52%
of
which
is
properly
allocable
to
the
regulated
company.
an
affiliated
group
cannot
by
virtue
of
their
100%
affiliation
settle
the
regulated
company
with
more
cost
than
the
group
is
actually
incurring
upon
behalf
of
that
company.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
thank
you.
