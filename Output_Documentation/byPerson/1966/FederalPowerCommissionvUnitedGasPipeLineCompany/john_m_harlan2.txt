i
understand

and
not
a
question
of
power
and
therefore
not
here
so
far
as
i
can
quickly
make
a
suggestion.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
factor
that
was
involved
was
that
under
the
particular
relationship
of
the
corporations
that
were
there
involved.
those
corporations
could've
been
realigned
corporately
very
easily.
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
we
could
bring
the
case
--
could've
brought
the
case
to
this
court,
the
holding
company,
the
parent
corporation
had
disposed
of
enough
of
its
stock
in
the
regulated
company
and
that
the
regulated
company
was
no
longer
a
member
of
the
affiliated
group
with
that
possibility
of
change
that
would
affect
the
tax
rate;
there
was
no
occasion
for
pressing
it
there.
the
commission
seems
to
me
to
have
been
seeking
to
avoid
using
as
a
basis
for
determining
the
taxes
would
be
paid,
an
assumption
that
could
be
easily
avoided
by
re-incorporation
and
it
therefore
left
to
one
side
those
non-regulated
companies
that
could
be
reincorporated
and
incorporate
with
in
one
corporation
enough
income
to
absorb
all
of
the
losses
that
were
producing
the
reduction
there.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
