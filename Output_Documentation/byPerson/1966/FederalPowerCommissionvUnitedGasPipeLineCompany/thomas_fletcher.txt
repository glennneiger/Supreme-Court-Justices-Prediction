mr.
thomas
fletcher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
present
the
argument
that
i
would
like
to
present
to
this
court,
i
should
like
to
say
that
the
most
significant
thing
to
me
about
the
arguments
just
presented
is
the
complete
absence
of
identification
to
this
court
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
losses
are
appropriated
for
united's
jurisdictional
customers
by
this
device
are
oil
tax
losses
of
an
affiliate
union
producing
company
not
subject
to
fpc
regulation
whose
cost
and
expenses
are
at
no
point
included
in
united's
taxable
income.
that
is
the
jurisdictional
sickness
which
two
dissenting
commissioners
noted
and
which
both
the
court
below
and
the
tenth
circuit
and
city
service
said
was
the
unlawful
part
of
the
sort
of
that
required
to
be
set
aside.

i
shall
call
united
is

the

of

are
entirely
different,
separate
and
distinct

of
entirely
different
nature
from
the

the
united
group
does
been
qualified
filed
consolidated
federal
income
tax
returns
during
the
fpc
representative
period
of
1957
to
1961
being
joined
in
1961
by
overseas.
in
a
section
for
rate
review
of
united,
the
fpc
in
computing
federal
income
tax
component
and
united's
cost
of
service
instead
of
applying
the
statutory
corporate
rate
of
52%
to
united's
taxable
income
substituted
for
that
rate
a
lower
so-called
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
of
50.04%
not
statutory
to
provide
it
which
results
from
a
computation
after
utilizing
deductions
and
tax
losses
arising
from
operations
of
united's
affiliated
companies.
this
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
is
attributable
to
united's
joinder
with
its
affiliates
in
a
consolidated
federal
income
tax
return
filed
by
the
parent
corporation.
this
computed
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
gives
united's
jurisdictional
gas
customers
the
benefit
of
tax
deductions
and
losses
which
are
not
united's
but
which
belong
wholly
to
its
affiliates
union
and
overseas
and
arise
solely
from
their
oil
operations
which
are
not
only
not
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
but
are
none
utility
operations
wholly
unrelated
to
united's
operations
and
not
reflected
in
united's
cost
of
service.
thus,
it's
frame
the
question
for
decision
whether
the
fpc
may
utilize
such
oil
tax
deductions
and
losses
of
united's
affiliates
to
reduce
the
federal
income
tax
component
includable
in
united's
cost
of
service
on
which
united's
rates
for
sale
of
gas
regulated
under
the
act
are
based.
the
effective
consolidated
tax
rate
formula
originated
in
1963
in
the
fpc
city
service
decision
on
review
the
tenth
circuit
declared
that
acknowledge
jurisdictional
limits
required
an
effective
separation
of
activities,
profits
and
losses
between
regulated
and
non-regulated
businesses
in
determining
the
tax
allowance
includable
in
cost
of
service.
otherwise,
it
quoted
this
court's
opinion
in
panhandle
eastern
versus
fpc
at
324
u.s.,
"the
profits
and
losses
as
the
case
may
be
are
the
unregulated
business
would
be
assigned
to
the
regulated
business
and
the
commission
would
transgress
the
jurisdictional
lines
which
congress
wrote
into
the
act."
because
the
fpc
order
and
its
three
step
allocation
violated
this
principle
by
taking
into
account
tax
losses
of
non-regulated
and
unrelated
affiliates
to
calculate
the
tax
allowance
includable
in
the
cost
of
service
of
the
regulated
company,
the
order
was
set
aside,
it's
unauthorized
while
that
appeal
pending,
the
fpc
directed
application
of
its
city
service
formula
to
united
declaring
complete
factual
similarity
between
the
two
cases.
in
the
court
below,
united
asserted
the
same
jurisdictional
violation
of
judge
by
the
tenth
circuit
claiming
direct
and
unequivocal
support
from
that
decision.
the
fifth
circuit
declared
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
correct
and
its
principles
here
applicable
in
controlling
and
set
aside
the
(inaudible).
apart
from
other
compelling
reasons,
there
are
two
reasons
which
in
my
submission
require
full
and
speedy
affirmance
of
this
judgment.
in
the
first
place,
the
fpc
in
its
brief
at
page
15
and
at
page
10
in
this
petition
footnote
8
concedes
the
fact
that
this
formula
does
have
effect
to
appropriate
the
whole
of
these
unregulated
tax
losses
of
the
unregulated
company
and
give
them
to
the
regulated
company.
thus,
it
confesses
their
very
jurisdiction
of
transgression
which
both
the
fifth
and
tenth
circuit's
judge.
the
fpc
seeks
to
retrieve
by
suggesting
its
order
might
be
supported
by
some
character
of
a
"sharing
of
benefits"
of
the
non-jurisdictional
tax
losses
but
it
is
clear
that
a
sharing
of
these
non-regulated,
non-jurisdictional
tax
losses
with
united's
jurisdictional
customers
would
also
be
unlawful
or
it
would
produce
the
identical
jurisdictional
transgression
for
which
the
court
below
vacated
this
order,
a
jurisdiction
violation
which
the
fpc
now
admits.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
let
me
get
it
for
you,
your
honor.
on
line
15
--
page
15
line
2,
you
begin
the
court
below
did
not
criticize
the
particular
formula
which
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
results
in
"allocating
the
whole
of
the
savings
to
the
companies
that
had
taxable
income."
then
when
you
go
over
to
the
reference
in
the
petition
your
honor,
you
will
see
that
the
language
is
just
plain
sidewalk
language
that
identifies
"savings"
as
precisely
the
same
thing
as
these
unregulated
tax
losses.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
footnote
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
there
may
be
indeed
problems
in
the
application
of
the
particular
formula
used
by
the
commission
in
this
case
a
formula
which
may
result
in
allocating
the
entire
tax
saving
resulting
from
losses
on
unregulated
activities
to
the
regulated
members
of
the
consolidated
group.
in
the
petition,
they
used
the
dubious
word
"may".
in
the
brief,
they
went
to
the
flat
word
"does".
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
the
fpc
exposes
this
sharing
to
be
specious
or
declares
that
the
parent's
income
for
the
representative
period
was
in
excess
of
$9
million
almost
three
times
the
aggregate
of
union
and
overseas
non-jurisdictional,
unregulated
in
all
of
tax
deductions
and
losses
of
$3.8
million.
the
parent
put
up
the
capital
that
produced
these
tax
losses
as
the
sole
investor
of
union
it
is
clearly
entitled
to
all
of
the
benefits
of
such
losses
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
tax
regulations
governing
adjustment
of
the
parent's
tax
cost
basis
to
the
extent
such
tax
losses
cannot
be
recouped
by
union.
in
the
second
place,
the
fpc
represents
to
this
court
at
page
7
of
its
brief
that
under
its
formula
any
losses
sustained
by
an
unregulated
company
or
activity
must
first
be
set
off
against
the
total
income
of
all
unregulated
operation.
this,
like
the
formula's
first
step
separate
the
companies
in
the
regulated
and
unregulated
groups
necessary
is
in
the
juror
--
jurisdiction
of
context
of
regulated
under
the
act.
regulated
really
can
have
no
other
term
of
reference
but
in
applying
its
illegal
formula,
the
fpc
completely
disregarded
this,
corporation
the
parent
was
not
subject
to
it's
regulation
but
it
placed
corporation
wholly
in
the
regulated
group
and
an
authorized
act.
though
united
was
only
44%
subject
to
its
regulation,
the
fpc
ignored
the
greater
56%,
non-jurisdictional
and
placed
united
entirely
in
the
regulated
group.
hardly
50%
of
union's
business
is
subject
to
fpc
regulation.
its
intrastate
gas
business
and
substantial
oil
business
is
unregulated
for
the
representative
period
its
gas
business
had
a
taxable
income
of
$507,000.00
while
its
oil
operations
resulted
in
a
gross
loss
of
$4.3
million
overseas
in
1961
had
a
loss
of
an
excess
of
$24,000.00.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
a
meaningful
and
proper
separation
into
regulated
and
unregulated
groups
as
step
one
specified
would
place
far
greater
income
to
unregulated
operations.
56%
of
united's
operations
alone
would
produce
an
amount
far
in
excess
of
union
and
overseas
oil
tax
deduction
as
noted
the
parent's
taxable
income
of
$9
million
all
from
activities
not
regulated
by
the
fpc
was
almost
three
times
the
amount
of
this
oil
tax
loss.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
certainly
do
so.
i
say
that
the
commission
was
without
any
power
and
it
was
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
i
say
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
52%
of
united's
taxable
income
and
this
record
shows
that
a
check
for
that
amount
is
written.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
to
the
government.

thomas

that's
at
the
page
76
and
77
of
volume
1
of
the
joined
appendix.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
but
mr.
justice
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
united
is
44%
of
its
regulated,
yes
by
the
fpc.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
and
i
will
go
further
than
that.
i
will
say
that
under
this
record,
it
could
not
be
treated
in
any
other
fashion
because
the
only
way,
the
fpc
here
undertakes
to
reduce
that
is
to
reach
out
beyond
its
jurisdictional
power
and
seize
unregulated
oil
loss.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
not
a
single
penny.
they're
filing
on
the
consolidated
basis
of
course
your
honor
produced
an
amount
of
tax
less
than
it
would
have
been
had
all
companies
filed
the
separate
return,
that's
a
fact.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
but
that
was
a
saving
to
the
parent
that
was
a
loss
which
only
the
parent
could
utilize
only
the
parent
could
prepare
the
consolidated
return,
only
the
parent
could
offset
the
losses
against
the
income
and
it
was
against
consolidated
income.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
to
the
government
in
my
recollection
to
that
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
of
course,
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
now,
how
they
did
it
actually
in
that
situation
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
they
allocate
mr.
justice
as
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
may
i
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
want
to
answer
that
but
i
have
to
do
it
as
i
understand
the
situation.
as
the
regulations
require
each
company
in
this
group
did
actually
prepare
a
return
on
a
separate
return
basis
and
forward
to
the
parent
and
the
parent
then
combine
as
the
regulations
require
the
--
all
of
the
income
and
all
of
the
losses
and
allocated
back
or
rather
credited
the
losses
against
the
income
and
the
resulting
income
was
that
on
which
the
consolidated
facts
was
computed.
now,
let
me
go
further
because
this
is
part
of
my
understanding
of
answering
your
question.
they
had
to
do
an
allocation
as
required
by
section
1552
not
point
in
a
division
among
themselves
but
because
the
government
required
that
to
determine
the
earnings
and
profits
of
each
company
free
from
any
company
transactions
and
of
course
that
goes
again
toward
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
cost
basis
is
reduced
but
there
was
no
allocation
in
the
sense
of
an
allocation
to
determine
a
pro-rata
part
of
responsibility
for
the
consolidated
tax.
each
participant
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i'm
not
--
don't
believe
that
that
is
necessarily
correct,
your
honor
that
could
be
the
case,
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
the
regulations
require
that
each
member
be
severally
liable
for
the
entire
consolidated
tax.
now,
of
course
they
can't
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
they
can't
get
to
it
without
doing
what
the
regulations
require
and
that
they
did
no
more
and
no
less
and
in
the
combination
of
it
of
course
the
parent
did
take
these
losses
and
aggregate
them
and
then
apply
them
to
the
aggregate
of
the
income.
i
believe
is
that
your
--
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
if
the
fpc
had
done
what
it
represents
to
this
court
it
must
first
do
all
of
these
losses
would
have
been
credited
against
unregulated
income
and
there
would
have
been
nothing
left
for
the
commission
to
do
in
computing
united's
income
tax
component
includable
in
its
cost
of
service
but
to
use
from
the
jurisdictional
business
its
taxable
income
time
52%.
now,
from
the
very
earliest
days
under
the
act,
this
court
has
held
that
fundamental
rate
make
rate
making
principles
require
separation
of
regulated
and
unregulated
businesses
in
order
to
avoid
the
very
jurisdictional
transgression
which
the
court
below
adjudged.
this
is
done
in
panhandle
eastern
versus
fpc
and
colorado
interstate
versus
fpc
both
the
324
u.s.
this
principle
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
section
1
(b)
of
the
act,
in
its
pipeline
rate
proceedings
which
are
based
on
the
cost
of
service
method,
the
fpc
determines
rates
for
sales
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
designed
to
recoup
that
cost
of
service
consisting
solely
of
a
fair
return
on
facilities
used
only
to
make
the
jurisdictional
service
and
of
the
cost
and
expenses
incurred
only
in
the
course
of
that
jurisdictional
service
to
ensure
that
this
cost
of
service
keeps
within
the
act's
jurisdictional
bounds.
the
fpc
habitually
and
regularly
separates
out
all
non-jurisdictional
sales
and
activities
and
they're
accompanying
income
cost
and
expenses.
the
fpc
earlier
comprehended
applicability
of
these
principles
and
the
tax
sale
there
as
set
out
in
its
mississippi
river
corporation
opinion
for
fpc
340.
in
the
city
service
case,
it
expressly
declared
applicability
to
this
tax
issue
of
a
necessity
to
separate
the
unregulated
from
the
regulated
as
the
tenth
circuit
noted.
but
neither
in
city
service
nor
in
this
case
did
the
fpc
so
separate
though
here
it
declared
the
record
permitted
separation
of
union's
taxable
income
between
its
regulated
and
unregulated
but
said
this
would
make
no
difference
because
it
said
union
was
in
a
taxable
loss
position
for
the
representative
period.
but
union's
losses
were
non-regulated
and
non-jurisdictional
losses
and
not
then
that
tax
loss
of
position
does
not
substitute
in
my
opinion
for
jurisdiction
expressly
denied
nor
did
united
by
joining
and
filing
consolidated
return
lose
its
separate
entity
nor
the
separate
identity
of
its
gas
operations
nor
did
union
lose
the
separate
identity
of
its
non-jurisdictional
unregulated
oil
operations.
the
tax
regulations
preserved
the
separate
identity
by
defining
consolidated
income
on
which
tax
computation
is
made
as
a
combination
of
taxable
incomes
computed
separately
for
the
members
of
the
group
as
i
have
said
each
member
of
the
united
group
for
the
representative
period
prepare
to
return
on
a
separate
return
basis
and
deliver
it
to
the
parent
corporation.
the
parent
being
the
only
one
authorized
and
so
directed
by
the
code
and
applicable
regulations
combined
and
filed
the
consolidated
tax
return.
of
course,
as
the
regulations
provide
each
member
is
severally
liable
for
the
entire
tax.
thus,
the
parent's
combination
results
in
recoupment
in
that
year
instead
of
the
eight
years
permitted
by
the
carry
back
and
carry
over
provisions.
the
fpc
took
this
consolidated
tax
liability
a
figure
resulting
after
application
of
all
non-jurisdictional
and
unregulated
losses
and
divided
that
between
united
and
corporation
in
the
ratio
that
their
respective
taxable
income
bought
to
the
consolidated
income
then
it
related
the
amount
of
consolidated
tax
so
assigned
to
united,
to
united's
taxable
income
to
derive
the
50.04%.
thus,
the
50.04%
rate
is
a
fiction,
a
contrive
device
under
which
united's
jurisdictional
customers
improperly
received
the
tax
benefit
of
deductions
from
sources
other
than
united's
own
operations.
this
record
indisputably
shows
the
source
of
these
deductions
to
be
3.8
of
union's
net
oil
losses
and
the
$24,000.00
from
overseas.
the
fpc's
claim
that
this
consolidated
tax
is
a
joint
cost
requiring
allocation
is
in
my
opinion
without
cost.
a
federal
income
tax
results
from
application
of
a
prescribed
tax
rate
to
a
properly
determined
amount
of
taxable
income.
united's
taxable
income
has
its
genesis
solely
in
united's
own
separate
business
operations
as
this
true
of
every
other
member
of
the
united
group.
united's
taxable
income
does
not
derive
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
joint
use
or
operation
by
united
on
its
affiliates
of
any
facility
or
property.
the
resulting
tax
liability
of
each
member
of
united
and
each
member
of
the
group
is
a
direct
cost
of
each.
allocation
is
a
useful
tool
for
the
fpc
to
use
to
separate
that
subject
to
his
jurisdiction
from
that
which
is
not
but
allocation
serves
no
function
to
identity
united's
taxable
income
for
that
arises
only
from
united's
operations.
furthermore,
the
wisdom
of
the
separation
requirement
is
obvious
from
union's
operations.this
uncontradicted
record
shows
as
i
have
said
that
union's
gas
operations
were
taxable.
its
oil
operations
in
a
loss
position
but
petitioner
say
that
united
customers
in
some
fashion
never
identified
contribute
to
union's
oil
cost
and
hence
i
would
be
able
to
share
in
these
so-called
oil
tax
losses.
but
fpc
application
of
this
separation
principle
shows
this
to
be
false.
in
union's
fpc
proceeding,
the
fpc
by
an
allocation
method
of
relative
cost
which
it
declared
wholly
adequate
carefully
strained
out
all
possible
costs,
expenses
and
income
from
oil
and
other
non-jurisdictional
operations
and
activities
so
that
there
was
left
a
rate
based
and
cost
of
service
restricted
solely
and
alone
to
jurisdictional
gas
operations
on
which
union's
jurisdictional
rates
were
determined
and
approved
including
those
covering
its
sale
of
gas
to
united.
so,
union's
fpc
approved
rates
which
united
pays
contains
no
cost
or
expenses
which
give
rise
to
union's
oil
tax
deductions.
the
consequent
impact
on
united
and
its
jurisdictional
customers
are
these
forbidden
focused
on
union's
oil
situation
will
surely
be
rate
instability
rates
rising
or
falling
with
union's
oil
tax
deductions
and
losses
and
without
respect
whatever
to
the
continuation
increase
or
falling
of
united's
cost
and
expenses
over
all
of
these
union
matters.
the
fpc
has
no
control
in
which
united's
customers
have
no
interest
and
to
which
they
make
no
contribution.
petitioner
say
that
the
united
group
constitution
in
a
greater
system
operated
as
one
company
with
each
member
of
the
group
acting
as
a
department
and
that
the
parent's
consolidated
tax
constitutes
the
taxes
actually
paid
under
the
doctrine
of
el
paso
versus
fpc
by
the
firth
circuit
certiorari
denied.
but
this
reliance
on
el
paso
strongly
advanced
the
law
as
misplaced.
the
fifth
circuit
obviously
did
not
agree
with
petitioners
or
it
did
not
discuss
or
cite
el
paso.
el
paso
on
the
other
hand
refutes
this
claim
and
is
utterly
and
clearly
distinguishable.
first,
it
had
no
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
issue.
second,
el
paso
made
no
attempt
to
reduce
gas
rates
through
utilization
of
el
paso's
oil
department
operations.
this
is
the
one
corporation
when
some
question
was
asked
by
the
fpc
regulates
and
they
are
department
but
here
they
made
no
effort
to
utilize
the
oil
department
losses
operations.
third,
the
fpc
and
el
paso
capital
has
separated
out
all
oil
and
other
none
utility
operations
including
that
tax
consequences
leaving
only
jurisdictional
gas
operations
or
the
tax
expense
in
el
paso
reflect
its
statutory
depletion
and
intangible
drilling
allowance
relating
solely
and
only
to
natural
gas
operation.
as
i
read
the
el
paso,
it's
clear
that
fpc
authority
over
tax
deductions
is
restricted
to
jurisdiction
of
gas
operations
of
the
regulated
company.
but
petitioners
further
argue
that
the
united
group
can
achieve
the
benefits
from
consolidated
tax
procedure
because
the
regulated
monopoly
of
united
guarantees
a
profitability
that
will
always
permit
full
advantage
to
absorb
union's
tax
losses.
aside
from
the
fact
as
we
shall
show
that
union
can
utilize
its
own
tax
losses
and
that
the
parent
corporation
either
can
utilize
such
tax
losses
against
its
own
income
or
to
be
extent
union
does
not
so
utilize
with
separate
reduction
of
its
tax
cost
basis.
the
regulated
monopoly
and
guaranteed
profitability
concept
pointed
to
44%
of
united's
jurisdictional
business
we
--
are
44%
of
its
total
business
we
deem
to
be
unsound.
the
fpc
policy
of
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
which
is
again
been
voiced
here
this
morning
and
this
concept
of
guaranteed
profitability
are
mutually
inconsistent.
the
concept
is
further
destroyed
by
union's
ability
to
take
care
of
its
own
losses.
it
would
have
a
period
of
eight
years,
three
back
and
five
forward
under
the
carry
back,
carry
forward
provisions.this
record
shows
that
it
can
utilize
that
and
use
its
own
tax
losses.
now,
this
record
when
this
court
gets
to
it
will
show
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
that
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
let
me
finish
this
sentence
would
you
please
sir?
mr.
thomas
fletcher
would
show
that
this
testimony
was
not
cross-examined
and
it
was
not
disputed
from
any
source.
now
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
--
1958.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
union
in
1958
as
i
recall
it,
it
had
any
excess
of
considerably
in
excess
of
$4
million
taxable
income.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
over
the
five-year-period
the
net
tax
loss
of
union
was
$3.8
million.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
their
witness
your
honor
testified
that
he
had
had
a
study
made
and
he
had
found
that
they
would
unquestionably
be
able
to
utilize
their
own
tax
losses.
now,
what
that
study
was
the
record
don't
reflect,
he
was
not
cross-examined
about
it
and
there
was
no
contrary
evidence
it
was
put
in
to
the
record.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
the
record
you
have
correctly
stated
here
what
the
record
show.
now,
at
the
fpc
level
to
commissioner's
dissent
in
both
city
service
and
united
on
the
ground
(inaudible)
that
the
so-called
three
step
allocation
appropriated
losses
which
derived
from
expenditures
in
non-jurisdictional
business
activities
finance
not
by
the
regulated
gas
company's
customers
but
rather
by
stockholders
so
that
it
had
the
effect
of
regulation
by
the
commission
of
non-utility
enterprises
beyond
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
both
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
below
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
city
service
found
that
such
three-step
formula
that
the
fpc
device
did
appropriate
this
non-jurisdictional
unregulated
unrelated
tax
losses
and
that
that
resulted
in
a
violation
of
the
jurisdictional
limits
which
congress
wrote
into
the
act,
a
transgression
already
declared
by
this
court
in
panhandle.
in
this
case,
the
fpc
confesses
that
the
formula
does
appropriate
the
whole
of
those
non-jurisdictional
unregulated
losses.
thus,
it
is
that
the
decision
below
in
my
opinion
is
not
only
right
but
which
it
merits
affirmance
but
the
fpc
confesses
that
rightness
on
the
specific
ground
adjudged.
it
is
accordingly
respectfully
submitted
that
the
decision
below
should
be
in
all
things
affirm
and
it
is
so
respectfully
pray.
i'm
grateful
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
present
the
argument
that
i
would
like
to
present
to
this
court,
i
should
like
to
say
that
the
most
significant
thing
to
me
about
the
arguments
just
presented
is
the
complete
absence
of
identification
to
this
court
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
losses
are
appropriated
for
united's
jurisdictional
customers
by
this
device
are
oil
tax
losses
of
an
affiliate
union
producing
company
not
subject
to
fpc
regulation
whose
cost
and
expenses
are
at
no
point
included
in
united's
taxable
income.
that
is
the
jurisdictional
sickness
which
two
dissenting
commissioners
noted
and
which
both
the
court
below
and
the
tenth
circuit
and
city
service
said
was
the
unlawful
part
of
the
sort
of
that
required
to
be
set
aside.

i
shall

the

the

group
does
been
qualified
filed
consolidated
federal

tax
returns
during
the
fpc
representative
period
of
1957
to
1961
being
joined
in
1961
by
overseas.
in
a
section
for
rate
review
of
united,
the
fpc
in
computing
federal
income
tax
component
and
united's
cost
of
service
instead
of
applying
the
statutory
corporate
rate
of
52%
to
united's
taxable
income
substituted
for
that
rate
a
lower
so-called
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
of
50.04%
not
statutory
to
provide
it
which
results
from
a
computation
after
utilizing
deductions
and
tax
losses
arising
from
operations
of
united's
affiliated
companies.
this
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
is
attributable
to
united's
joinder
with
its
affiliates
in
a
consolidated
federal
income
tax
return
filed
by
the
parent
corporation.
this
computed
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
gives
united's
jurisdictional
gas
customers
the
benefit
of
tax
deductions
and
losses
which
are
not
united's
but
which
belong
wholly
to
its
affiliates
union
and
overseas
and
arise
solely
from
their
oil
operations
which
are
not
only
not
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
but
are
none
utility
operations
wholly
unrelated
to
united's
operations
and
not
reflected
in
united's
cost
of
service.
thus,
it's
frame
the
question
for
decision
whether
the
fpc
may
utilize
such
oil
tax
deductions
and
losses
of
united's
affiliates
to
reduce
the
federal
income
tax
component
includable
in
united's
cost
of
service
on
which
united's
rates
for
sale
of
gas
regulated
under
the
act
are
based.
the
effective
consolidated
tax
rate
formula
originated
in
1963
in
the
fpc
city
service
decision
on
review
the
tenth
circuit
declared
that
acknowledge
jurisdictional
limits
required
an
effective
separation
of
activities,
profits
and
losses
between
regulated
and
non-regulated
businesses
in
determining
the
tax
allowance
includable
in
cost
of
service.
otherwise,
it
quoted
this
court's
opinion
in
panhandle
eastern
versus
fpc
at
324
u.s.,
"the
profits
and
losses
as
the
case
may
be
are
the
unregulated
business
would
be
assigned
to
the
regulated
business
and
the
commission
would
transgress
the
jurisdictional
lines
which
congress
wrote
into
the
act."
because
the
fpc
order
and
its
three
step
allocation
violated
this
principle
by
taking
into
account
tax
losses
of
non-regulated
and
unrelated
affiliates
to
calculate
the
tax
allowance
includable
in
the
cost
of
service
of
the
regulated
company,
the
order
was
set
aside,
it's
unauthorized
while
that
appeal
pending,
the
fpc
directed
application
of
its
city
service
formula
to
united
declaring
complete
factual
similarity
between
the
two
cases.
in
the
court
below,
united
asserted
the
same
jurisdictional
violation
of
judge
by
the
tenth
circuit
claiming
direct
and
unequivocal
support
from
that
decision.
the
fifth
circuit
declared
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
correct
and
its
principles
here
applicable
in
controlling
and
set
aside
the
(inaudible).
apart
from
other
compelling
reasons,
there
are
two
reasons
which
in
my
submission
require
full
and
speedy
affirmance
of
this
judgment.
in
the
first
place,
the
fpc
in
its
brief
at
page
15
and
at
page
10
in
this
petition
footnote
8
concedes
the
fact
that
this
formula
does
have
effect
to
appropriate
the
whole
of
these
unregulated
tax
losses
of
the
unregulated
company
and
give
them
to
the
regulated
company.
thus,
it
confesses
their
very
jurisdiction
of
transgression
which
both
the
fifth
and
tenth
circuit's
judge.
the
fpc
seeks
to
retrieve
by
suggesting
its
order
might
be
supported
by
some
character
of
a
"sharing
of
benefits"
of
the
non-jurisdictional
tax
losses
but
it
is
clear
that
a
sharing
of
these
non-regulated,
non-jurisdictional
tax
losses
with
united's
jurisdictional
customers
would
also
be
unlawful
or
it
would
produce
the
identical
jurisdictional
transgression
for
which
the
court
below
vacated
this
order,
a
jurisdiction
violation
which
the
fpc
now
admits.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
let
me
get
it
for
you,
your

on
line

--
page
15
line
2,
you
begin
the
court
below
did
not
criticize
the
particular
formula
which
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
results
in
"allocating
the
whole
of
the
savings
to
the
companies
that
had
taxable
income."
then
when
you
go
over
to
the
reference
in
the
petition
your
honor,
you
will
see
that
the
language
is
just
plain
sidewalk
language
that
identifies
"savings"
as
precisely
the
same
thing
as
these
unregulated
tax
losses.
mr.

footnote

mr.
thomas

yes
sir.
there
may
be
indeed
problems
in
the
application
of
the
particular
formula
used
by
the
commission
in
this
case
a
formula
which
may
result
in
allocating
the
entire

saving
resulting
from
losses
on
unregulated

to
the
regulated
members
of
the
consolidated
group.
in
the
petition,
they
used
the
dubious
word
"may".
in
the
brief,
they
went
to
the
flat
word
"does".
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
the
fpc
exposes
this
sharing
to
be
specious
or
declares
that
the
parent's
income
for
the
representative
period
was
in
excess
of
$9
million
almost
three
times
the
aggregate
of
union
and
overseas
non-jurisdictional,
unregulated
in
all
of
tax
deductions
and
losses
of
$3.8
million.
the
parent
put
up
the
capital
that
produced
these
tax
losses
as
the
sole
investor
of
union
it
is
clearly
entitled
to
all
of
the
benefits
of
such
losses
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
tax
regulations
governing
adjustment
of
the
parent's
tax
cost
basis
to
the
extent
such
tax
losses
cannot
be
recouped
by
union.
in
the
second
place,
the
fpc
represents
to
this
court
at
page
7
of
its
brief
that
under
its
formula
any
losses
sustained
by
an
unregulated
company
or
activity
must
first
be
set
off
against
the
total
income
of
all
unregulated
operation.
this,
like
the
formula's
first
step
separate
the
companies
in
the
regulated
and
unregulated
groups
necessary
is
in
the
juror
--
jurisdiction
of
context
of
regulated
under
the
act.
regulated
really
can
have
no
other
term
of
reference
but
in
applying
its
illegal
formula,
the
fpc
completely
disregarded
this,
corporation
the
parent
was
not
subject
to
it's
regulation
but
it
placed
corporation
wholly
in
the
regulated
group
and
an
authorized
act.
though
united
was
only
44%
subject
to
its
regulation,
the
fpc
ignored
the
greater
56%,
non-jurisdictional
and
placed
united
entirely
in
the
regulated
group.
hardly
50%
of
union's
business
is
subject
to
fpc
regulation.
its
intrastate
gas
business
and
substantial
oil
business
is
unregulated
for
the
representative
period
its
gas
business
had
a
taxable
income
of
$507,000.00
while
its
oil
operations
resulted
in
a
gross
loss
of
$4.3
million
overseas
in
1961
had
a
loss
of
an
excess
of
$24,000.00.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
a
meaningful
and
proper
separation
into
regulated
and
unregulated
groups
as
step
one
specified
would
place
far
greater
income
to
unregulated
operations.
56%
of
united's
operations
alone
would
produce
an
amount
far
in
excess
of
union
and
overseas
oil
tax
deduction
as
noted
the
parent's
taxable
income
of
$9
million
all
from
activities
not
regulated
by
the
fpc
was
almost
three
times
the
amount
of
this
oil
tax
loss.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
certainly
do
so.
i
say
that
the
commission
was
without
any
power
and
it
was
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
i
say
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
52%
of
united's
taxable
income
and
this
record
shows
that
a
check
for
that
amount
is
written.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
to
the
government.
mr.
thomas
fletcher

united
gas
pipeline
company.
that's
at
the
page
76
and
77
of
volume
1
of
the
joined
appendix.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
but
mr.
justice
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
united
is
44%
of
its
regulated,
yes
by
the
fpc.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
and
i
will
go
further
than
that.
i
will
say
that
under
this
record,
it
could
not
be
treated
in
any
other
fashion
because
the
only
way,
the
fpc
here
undertakes
to
reduce
that
is
to
reach
out
beyond
its
jurisdictional
power
and
seize
unregulated
oil
loss.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
not
a
single
penny.
they're
filing
on
the
consolidated
basis
of
course
your
honor
produced
an
amount
of
tax
less
than
it
would
have
been
had
all
companies
filed
the
separate
return,
that's
a
fact.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
but
that
was
a
saving
to
the
parent
that
was
a
loss
which
only
the
parent
could
utilize
only
the
parent
could
prepare
the
consolidated
return,
only
the
parent
could
offset
the
losses
against
the
income
and
it
was
against
consolidated
income.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes,
to
the
government
in
my
recollection
to
that
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
of
course,
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
now,
how
they
did
it
actually
in
that
situation
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
they
allocate
mr.
justice
as
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
may
i
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
want
to
answer
that
but
i
have
to
do
it
as
i
understand
the
situation.
as
the
regulations
require
each
company
in
this
group
did
actually
prepare
a
return
on
a
separate
return
basis
and
forward
to
the
parent
and
the
parent
then
combine
as
the
regulations
require
the
--
all
of
the
income
and
all
of
the
losses
and
allocated
back
or
rather
credited
the
losses
against
the
income
and
the
resulting
income
was
that
on
which
the
consolidated
facts
was
computed.
now,
let
me
go
further
because
this
is
part
of
my
understanding
of
answering
your
question.
they
had
to
do
an
allocation
as
required
by
section
1552
not
point
in
a
division
among
themselves
but
because
the
government
required
that
to
determine
the
earnings
and
profits
of
each
company
free
from
any
company
transactions
and
of
course
that
goes
again
toward
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
cost
basis
is
reduced
but
there
was
no
allocation
in
the
sense
of
an
allocation
to
determine
a
pro-rata
part
of
responsibility
for
the
consolidated
tax.
each
participant
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i'm
not
--
don't
believe
that
that
is
necessarily
correct,
your
honor
that
could
be
the
case,
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
the
regulations
require
that
each
member
be
severally
liable
for
the
entire
consolidated
tax.
now,
of
course
they
can't
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
they
can't
get
to
it
without
doing
what
the
regulations
require
and
that
they
did
no
more
and
no
less
and
in
the
combination
of
it
of
course
the
parent
did
take
these
losses
and
aggregate
them
and
then
apply
them
to
the
aggregate
of
the
income.
i
believe
is
that
your
--
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
if
the
fpc
had
done
what
it
represents
to
this
court
it
must
first
do
all
of
these
losses
would
have
been
credited
against
unregulated
income
and
there
would
have
been
nothing
left
for
the
commission
to
do
in
computing
united's
income
tax
component
includable
in
its
cost
of
service
but
to
use
from
the
jurisdictional
business
its
taxable
income
time
52%.
now,
from
the
very
earliest
days
under
the
act,
this
court
has
held
that
fundamental
rate
make
rate
making
principles
require
separation
of
regulated
and
unregulated
businesses
in
order
to
avoid
the
very
jurisdictional
transgression
which
the
court
below
adjudged.
this
is
done
in
panhandle
eastern
versus
fpc
and
colorado
interstate
versus
fpc
both
the
324
u.s.
this
principle
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
section
1
(b)
of
the
act,
in
its
pipeline
rate
proceedings
which
are
based
on
the
cost
of
service
method,
the
fpc
determines
rates
for
sales
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
designed
to
recoup
that
cost
of
service
consisting
solely
of
a
fair
return
on
facilities
used
only
to
make
the
jurisdictional
service
and
of
the
cost
and
expenses
incurred
only
in
the
course
of
that
jurisdictional
service
to
ensure
that
this
cost
of
service
keeps
within
the
act's
jurisdictional
bounds.
the
fpc
habitually
and
regularly
separates
out
all
non-jurisdictional
sales
and
activities
and
they're
accompanying
income
cost
and
expenses.
the
fpc
earlier
comprehended
applicability
of
these
principles
and
the
tax
sale
there
as
set
out
in
its
mississippi
river
corporation
opinion
for
fpc
340.
in
the
city
service
case,
it
expressly
declared
applicability
to
this
tax
issue
of
a
necessity
to
separate
the
unregulated
from
the
regulated
as
the
tenth
circuit
noted.
but
neither
in
city
service
nor
in
this
case
did
the
fpc
so
separate
though
here
it
declared
the
record
permitted
separation
of
union's
taxable
income
between
its
regulated
and
unregulated
but
said
this
would
make
no
difference
because
it
said
union
was
in
a
taxable
loss
position
for
the
representative
period.
but
union's
losses
were
non-regulated
and
non-jurisdictional
losses
and
not
then
that
tax
loss
of
position
does
not
substitute
in
my
opinion
for
jurisdiction
expressly
denied
nor
did
united
by
joining
and
filing
consolidated
return
lose
its
separate
entity
nor
the
separate
identity
of
its
gas
operations
nor
did
union
lose
the
separate
identity
of
its
non-jurisdictional
unregulated
oil
operations.
the
tax
regulations
preserved
the
separate
identity
by
defining
consolidated
income
on
which
tax
computation
is
made
as
a
combination
of
taxable
incomes
computed
separately
for
the
members
of
the
group
as
i
have
said
each
member
of
the
united
group
for
the
representative
period
prepare
to
return
on
a
separate
return
basis
and
deliver
it
to
the
parent
corporation.
the
parent
being
the
only
one
authorized
and
so
directed
by
the
code
and
applicable
regulations
combined
and
filed
the
consolidated
tax
return.
of
course,
as
the
regulations
provide
each
member
is
severally
liable
for
the
entire
tax.
thus,
the
parent's
combination
results
in
recoupment
in
that
year
instead
of
the
eight
years
permitted
by
the
carry
back
and
carry
over
provisions.
the
fpc
took
this
consolidated
tax
liability
a
figure
resulting
after
application
of
all
non-jurisdictional
and
unregulated
losses
and
divided
that
between
united
and
corporation
in
the
ratio
that
their
respective
taxable
income
bought
to
the
consolidated
income
then
it
related
the
amount
of
consolidated
tax
so
assigned
to
united,
to
united's
taxable
income
to
derive
the
50.04%.
thus,
the
50.04%
rate
is
a
fiction,
a
contrive
device
under
which
united's
jurisdictional
customers
improperly
received
the
tax
benefit
of
deductions
from
sources
other
than
united's
own
operations.
this
record
indisputably
shows
the
source
of
these
deductions
to
be
3.8
of
union's
net
oil
losses
and
the
$24,000.00
from
overseas.
the
fpc's
claim
that
this
consolidated
tax
is
a
joint
cost
requiring
allocation
is
in
my
opinion
without
cost.
a
federal
income
tax
results
from
application
of
a
prescribed
tax
rate
to
a
properly
determined
amount
of
taxable
income.
united's
taxable
income
has
its
genesis
solely
in
united's
own
separate
business
operations
as
this
true
of
every
other
member
of
the
united
group.
united's
taxable
income
does
not
derive
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
joint
use
or
operation
by
united
on
its
affiliates
of
any
facility
or
property.
the
resulting
tax
liability
of
each
member
of
united
and
each
member
of
the
group
is
a
direct
cost
of
each.
allocation
is
a
useful
tool
for
the
fpc
to
use
to
separate
that
subject
to
his
jurisdiction
from
that
which
is
not
but
allocation
serves
no
function
to
identity
united's
taxable
income
for
that
arises
only
from
united's
operations.
furthermore,
the
wisdom
of
the
separation
requirement
is
obvious
from
union's
operations.this
uncontradicted
record
shows
as
i
have
said
that
union's
gas
operations
were
taxable.
its
oil
operations
in
a
loss
position
but
petitioner
say
that
united
customers
in
some
fashion
never
identified
contribute
to
union's
oil
cost
and
hence
i
would
be
able
to
share
in
these
so-called
oil
tax
losses.
but
fpc
application
of
this
separation
principle
shows
this
to
be
false.
in
union's
fpc
proceeding,
the
fpc
by
an
allocation
method
of
relative
cost
which
it
declared
wholly
adequate
carefully
strained
out
all
possible
costs,
expenses
and
income
from
oil
and
other
non-jurisdictional
operations
and
activities
so
that
there
was
left
a
rate
based
and
cost
of
service
restricted
solely
and
alone
to
jurisdictional
gas
operations
on
which
union's
jurisdictional
rates
were
determined
and
approved
including
those
covering
its
sale
of
gas
to
united.
so,
union's
fpc
approved
rates
which
united
pays
contains
no
cost
or
expenses
which
give
rise
to
union's
oil
tax
deductions.
the
consequent
impact
on
united
and
its
jurisdictional
customers
are
these
forbidden
focused
on
union's
oil
situation
will
surely
be
rate
instability
rates
rising
or
falling
with
union's
oil
tax
deductions
and
losses
and
without
respect
whatever
to
the
continuation
increase
or
falling
of
united's
cost
and
expenses
over
all
of
these
union
matters.
the
fpc
has
no
control
in
which
united's
customers
have
no
interest
and
to
which
they
make
no
contribution.
petitioner
say
that
the
united
group
constitution
in
a
greater
system
operated
as
one
company
with
each
member
of
the
group
acting
as
a
department
and
that
the
parent's
consolidated
tax
constitutes
the
taxes
actually
paid
under
the
doctrine
of
el
paso
versus
fpc
by
the
firth
circuit
certiorari
denied.
but
this
reliance
on
el
paso
strongly
advanced
the
law
as
misplaced.
the
fifth
circuit
obviously
did
not
agree
with
petitioners
or
it
did
not
discuss
or
cite
el
paso.
el
paso
on
the
other
hand
refutes
this
claim
and
is
utterly
and
clearly
distinguishable.
first,
it
had
no
consolidated
effective
tax
rate
issue.
second,
el
paso
made
no
attempt
to
reduce
gas
rates
through
utilization
of
el
paso's
oil
department
operations.
this
is
the
one
corporation
when
some
question
was
asked
by
the
fpc
regulates
and
they
are
department
but
here
they
made
no
effort
to
utilize
the
oil
department
losses
operations.
third,
the
fpc
and
el
paso
capital
has
separated
out
all
oil
and
other
none
utility
operations
including
that
tax
consequences
leaving
only
jurisdictional
gas
operations
or
the
tax
expense
in
el
paso
reflect
its
statutory
depletion
and
intangible
drilling
allowance
relating
solely
and
only
to
natural
gas
operation.
as
i
read
the
el
paso,
it's
clear
that
fpc
authority
over
tax
deductions
is
restricted
to
jurisdiction
of
gas
operations
of
the
regulated
company.
but
petitioners
further
argue
that
the
united
group
can
achieve
the
benefits
from
consolidated
tax
procedure
because
the
regulated
monopoly
of
united
guarantees
a
profitability
that
will
always
permit
full
advantage
to
absorb
union's
tax
losses.
aside
from
the
fact
as
we
shall
show
that
union
can
utilize
its
own
tax
losses
and
that
the
parent
corporation
either
can
utilize
such
tax
losses
against
its
own
income
or
to
be
extent
union
does
not
so
utilize
with
separate
reduction
of
its
tax
cost
basis.
the
regulated
monopoly
and
guaranteed
profitability
concept
pointed
to
44%
of
united's
jurisdictional
business
we
--
are
44%
of
its
total
business
we
deem
to
be
unsound.
the
fpc
policy
of
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
which
is
again
been
voiced
here
this
morning
and
this
concept
of
guaranteed
profitability
are
mutually
inconsistent.
the
concept
is
further
destroyed
by
union's
ability
to
take
care
of
its
own
losses.
it
would
have
a
period
of
eight
years,
three
back
and
five
forward
under
the
carry
back,
carry
forward
provisions.this
record
shows
that
it
can
utilize
that
and
use
its
own
tax
losses.
now,
this
record
when
this
court
gets
to
it
will
show
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
that
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
let
me
finish
this
sentence
would
you
please
sir?
mr.
thomas
fletcher
would
show
that
this
testimony
was
not
cross-examined
and
it
was
not
disputed
from
any
source.
now
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor
--
mr.

--
1958.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes.
union
in
1958
as
i
recall
it,
it
had
any
excess
of
considerably
in
excess
of
$4
million
taxable
income.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
over
the
five-year-period
the
net
tax
loss
of
union
was
$3.8
million.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
well,
their
witness
your
honor
testified
that
he
had
had
a
study
made
and
he
had
found
that
they
would
unquestionably
be
able
to
utilize
their
own
tax
losses.
now,
what
that
study
was
the
record
don't
reflect,
he
was
not
cross-examined
about
it
and
there
was
no
contrary
evidence
it
was
put
in
to
the
record.
mr.
thomas
fletcher
yes
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
fletcher
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
the
record
you
have
correctly
stated
here
what
the
record
show.
now,
at
the
fpc
level
to
commissioner's
dissent
in
both
city
service
and
united
on
the
ground
(inaudible)
that
the
so-called
three
step
allocation
appropriated
losses
which
derived
from
expenditures
in
non-jurisdictional
business
activities
finance
not
by
the
regulated
gas
company's
customers
but
rather
by
stockholders
so
that
it
had
the
effect
of
regulation
by
the
commission
of
non-utility
enterprises
beyond
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
both
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
below
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
city
service
found
that
such
three-step
formula
that
the
fpc
device
did
appropriate
this
non-jurisdictional
unregulated
unrelated
tax
losses
and
that
that
resulted
in
a
violation
of
the
jurisdictional
limits
which
congress
wrote
into
the
act,
a
transgression
already
declared
by
this
court
in
panhandle.
in
this
case,
the
fpc
confesses
that
the
formula
does
appropriate
the
whole
of
those
non-jurisdictional
unregulated
losses.
thus,
it
is
that
the
decision
below
in
my
opinion
is
not
only
right
but
which
it
merits
affirmance
but
the
fpc
confesses
that
rightness
on
the
specific
ground
adjudged.
it
is
accordingly
respectfully
submitted
that
the
decision
below
should
be
in
all
things
affirm
and
it
is
so
respectfully
pray.
i'm
grateful
to
the
court.
