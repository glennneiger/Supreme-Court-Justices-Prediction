mr.
william
w.
brackett
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
start
by
referring
to
a
question
by
justice
white
relative
to
actual
taxes
in
what
united
the
regulated
company
actually
does.
the
fact
is
as
mr.
fletcher
summarized
that
united
reports
on
its
separate
return
which
is
consolidated
then
by
the
parent,
a
52%
tax
liability
and
does
in
fact
pay
a
check
which
is
transmitted
to
the
federal
government
for
that
52%
liability.
in
fact,
the
reason
that
this
case
is
here
is
that
the
federal
power
commission
objects
to
the
inter-company
transaction
to
the
way
and
which
the
company
files
and
pays
the
tax
does
not
believe
that
this
actual
tax
as
we
submit
it
is,
is
properly
applicable
to
the
united,
the
regulated
company
here
and
therefore
has
attacked
in
the
rate
regulation.
i'd
like
to
without
too
much
repetition
i
hope
stress
three
facts.
number
one,
under
the
federal
power
commission
method
here
in
question
it
is
union's
non-jurisdictional
oil
losses
which
cause
the
reduction
in
the
rates
of
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
united.
now,
this
is
key
to
this
case.
we
do
not
have
a
case
which
it
is
the
gas
operations
of
union
which
have
losses
and
therefore
the
el
paso
case
which
has
been
referred
to
is
wholly
irrelevant
here.
it
is
new
fact
non-jurisdictional
oil
losses
of
union
which
are
being
carried
over.
now,
this
fact
is
not
disputed.
staff
counsel
of
the
commission
level
conceded
that
it
was
a
use
of
oil
losses
and
that
shown
in
the
record,
volume
1,
page
120.
in
fact,
it
is
only
oil
losses.
there
are
no
gas
losses
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
exhibit
d
of
united's
brief
beside
the
appendix
to
united's
brief
which
is
supported
on
the
record.
and
the
commission
has
conceded
in
its
opinion
below
in
this
case
is
possible
to
separate
the
two
parts
of
union
between
gas
and
oil.
and
as
i've
indicated
it
is
the
oil
losses.
now,
justice
white
asked
at
one
point,
is
it
possible
for
a
regulated
company
to
have
a
loss?
it
is
of
could
well
have
and
then
in
some
of
these
years
the
gas
portion
of
union
had
some
losses
for
tax
purposes.
but
over
all,
over
the
representative
five-year
period,
it
did
not
so
we
are
dealing
only
with
none
jurisdictional
oil
losses.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
the
fpc
method
used
all
of
the
tax
reducing
results
of
the
losses
of
union's
oil
operations
to
reduce
the
rates
of
the
profit
companies.
that
means
the
fpc
jurisdictional
portion
of
united,
the
non-jurisdictional
portion
of
united
and
of
the
parent
company.
there
was
no
sharing
of
this
tax
benefit
between
the
loss
companies
which
produced
the
losses
which
made
the
tax
reduction
and
the
profit
companies.
number
three,
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
city
service
case
which
the
fpc
did
not
attempt
to
appeal
held
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
violation
again
there
was
not
a
holding
that
no
allocation
is
possible,
there
was
a
holding
that
the
allocation
method
applied
in
this
case
which
was
all
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
jurisdictional
violation
because
it
took
the
oil
losses
and
gave
all
of
the
benefits
to
the
profit
companies
including
the
regulated
portion
of
united.
the
court
of
appeals
also
did
not
hold
that
this
was
a
violation
because
union,
the
oil
and
gas
producer
was
unregulated
company
or
because
it
was
unrelated
to
united.
they
held
it's
clearly
and
wholly
on
the
jurisdictional
point
that
oil
losses
could
not
be
taken
across.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
choice
as
far
as
the
section
number
eludes
me
but
it
was
done
by
a
method
which
allocated
52%
of
the
separate
company
taxable
profit
of
united
to
united.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
actual
check
which
united
wrote
for
its
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it
is
my
understanding
of
that
section
which
i
do
not
consider
controlling
that
the
answer
of
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it
would've
permitted
it.
now,
if
that
method
which
did
as
you
state
will
set
result
had
been
then
used
for
rate
purposes.
it's
my
contention
that
it
would've
violated
the
jurisdictional
power
of
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
yes
your
honor,
i
do
not
rely
on
the
earnings
and
profits
allocation
method
on
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it's
permissible
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it
is
if
we
refine
it
a
bit.
we
have
to
add
certain
facts.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
number
one,
is
the
regulated
portion
regulated
by
the
fpc
and
i'm
sure
that
you
used
the
term
to
mean
that
it
is.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
now,
in
that
case,
then
we
have
essentially
a
recreation
of
the
el
paso
case
has
been
referred
to
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
that
case,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
losses
could
be
carried
over
because
it
was
gas
losses
which
were
also
subject
to
the
fpc's
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
alight,
then
the
unregulated
portion
is
not
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
in
that
case
i
would
say
that
the
result
should
be
the
same
as
we
urge
here.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
you're
saying
now
--
in
other
words,
you're
going
again
to
your
point
of
does
the
fact
of
the
check
control.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
answer
of
your
question
is
yes,
because
the
results
of
the
regulate
portion
do
in
fact
increase
the
--
either
decrease
the
refund
or
increase
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
--
or
increase
the
liability
by
the
amount
of
52%.
the
non-jurisdictional
portion
should
not
be
brought
across.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
answer
is
yes
because
the
contrary
answer
would
violate
the
well-known
regulatory
principle
which
i
suppose
was
stated
most
clearly
in
justice
douglas
panhandle
opinion
that
you
cannot
use
non-jurisdictional
results
to
reduce
jurisdictional
rates.
now,
the
converse
of
this
is
that
the
jurisdictional
rates
are
not
increased
by
the
fact
of
losses
of
the
non-jurisdictional
companies.
these
are
kept
separate
statutorily
and
regulatory.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
you
mean
enter
into
a
consolidated
tax
return?
mr.
william
w.
brackett
to
keep
them
separately
completely
as
you're
stating
i
have
take
it
justice
--
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
they
are
mixed
only
in
a
sense
mr.
justice
white
of
having
been
joined
by
a
cover
sheet
in
the
consolidated
tax
return
but
the
components
which
produced
that
net
consolidated
tax
are
perfectly
clearly
computable
and
are
separately
cost
by
the
separate
operations
of
the
various
companies.
now,
fpc
in
its
brief
really
admits
that
the
commission
aired
in
its
opinion
number
428,
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
these
admissions
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
10
they
stated
that
there
may
indeed
be
problems
if
the
entire
savings
from
the
regulated
losses
are
allocated
to
the
profit
companies.
and
then
at
page
15
of
their
brief,
they
admitted
that
this
in
fact
occurred
that
the
whole
of
the
losses
were
taken
and
applied
against
the
profits
of
the
profit
companies
in
this
case,
the
regulated
company,
united
and
the
other
companies.
this
court
really
need
go
no
further
than
this
admission.
there
was
no
sharing
between
profit
and
loss
companies
and
therefore
no
party
to
this
case
is
supporting
the
fpc
decision
as
it
was
written.
what
the
fpc
and
memphis
are
doing
are
supporting
an
alternative
method
which
they
say
the
commission
could
have
used
but
did
not
in
this
case.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please
before
the
noon
recess,
i
think
i
hope
i
established
that
the
losses
which
the
federal
power
commission
is
taken
into
effect
to
reduce
the
jurisdictional
rates
of
united
are
losses
of
the
non-jurisdictional
activities
of
the
affiliate
union
and
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
admitted
the
jurisdictional
violation
that
the
method
which
it
used
in
this
case
and
the
only
method
therefore
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
not
before
this
court
does
violate
jurisdictional
power.
the
commission
however,
implicitly
suggests
in
its
brief
that
there
is
some
other
method
which
would
not
violate
the
commission's
jurisdiction
suggests
that
this
method
might
be
by
using
some
of
the
oil
losses
allocating
others
to
the
loss
companies.
although
it's
irrelevant
and
not
in
this
case
i'd
like
to
touch
on
that
because
analytically
it
goes
to
the
questions
which
have
been
discussed
by
the
other
parties.
in
the
first
place,
this
use
of
these
losses
would
also
be
a
violation
even
if
there
was
only
a
portion
of
the
losses
because
it
crosses
the
jurisdictional
boundaries
and
the
same
principles
applies,
it's
not
a
quantitative
principle,
it's
a
question
of
what
is
the
source
of
the
loss.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
i'd
like
to
answer
your
question
and
perhaps
the
assumption,
the
answer
of
your
question
is
yes.
we
look
to
the
jurisdictional
company
and
the
income
and
expenses
which
produces.
i
do
not
understand
mr.
justice
white
what
you
mean
by
predictably.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
corporate
system
in
which
united
is
44%
regulated
by
the
fpc,
56%
is
not,
the
parent
company
is
not
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
in
those
facts
which
do
not
pertain
here
the
jurisdictional
principle
nevertheless
cuts
across.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
commission's
attempt
to
support
a
method
which
was
not
used
here
as
wrong
in
principle.
there
is
also
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
made
a
second
admission
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
this
morning
went
to
that
point.
he
asked,
why
did
the
commission
in
its
city
service
opinion
and
then
again
in
this
united
opinion
here
rejects
its
own
steps
proposed
method.
let
me
state
the
fact,
the
fact
is
that
the
staff
said
that
these
tax
losses
from
non-jurisdictional
sources
should
be
spread
evenly
across
the
profit
companies
irrespective
or
whether
they
are
profit
companies
are
regulated
by
the
fpc
or
not.
in
other
words,
to
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
united
the
same
as
to
the
non-jurisdictional
portions
of
any
company
and
therefore
that
it
would
be
an
even
spreading.
the
commission
rejected
this
and
stated
as
its
principle
that
you
must
first
offset
the
none
jurisdictional
losses
against
--
i'm
sorry,
they
determined
the
use
was
none
regulated
losses
against
none
regulated
income
and
that
only
the
excess
could
be
carried
over
against
the
regulated
companies.
now,
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
these
were
the
categories
of
the
commission
used,
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
recognition
of
the
boundaries
which
could
be
crossed
only
but
instead
only
a
partial
recognition
so
that
they
only
went
part
way
in
acceptance
of
the
jurisdictional
principles
because
as
i
stated
previously
crossing
the
jurisdictional
line
with
apportion
of
the
losses
is
also
a
violation.
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
in
fact
in
formulating
their
regulated
non-regulated
categories
of
the
companies
in
such
a
way
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
suggested
in
such
a
way
as
to
ignore
the
fpc
jurisdiction
and
to
sweep
in
to
the
regulated
category
companies
which
are
regulated
by
any
regulatory
agency.
the
commission
inevitably
set
up
a
method
which
ignores
its
own
jurisdiction
because
they
lump
together
as
in
the
regulated
category
companies
which
are
and
companies
which
are
not
and
portions
of
companies
which
are
not
regulated
by
the
fpc.
it
also
points
up
the
facts
that
had
the
commission
in
this
case
followed
the
theory
which
is
set
forth
of
offsetting
non-regulated
losses
against
rate
and
non-regulated
games.
had
they
followed
that
method
but
have
they
utilized
the
definition
of
regulated
which
followed
their
own
jurisdictional
limits
then
the
non-regulated
losses
from
the
oil
operations
of
union
would've
been
fully
used
up
by
offsetting
them
against
the
gas
operations
of
union
--
i'm
sorry,
against
the
non-regulated
gas
operations
of
united
and
non-jurisdictional
portion
which
were
sales
and
intrastate
commerce
or
even
more
clearly
by
offsetting
them
against
the
parent
company's
income
which
again
was
not
subject
to
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
so,
on
this
basis,
the
income
of
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
united
was
not
necessary
to
offset
the
losses
from
the
non-jurisdictional
oil
operations.
therefore,
we
have
two
violations
and
the
result
of
these
violations
is
to
produce
a
number
of
anomalies
and
inequities
and
regulation.
number
one,
the
jurisdictional
customers
of
united
did
not
pay
for
the
expenses
which
incurred
the
losses
of
union's
oil
operations.
federal
power
commission
in
allocating
cost
clearly
allocates
in
this
case
united
and
union
are
not
even
regulated
in
the
same
rate
cases.
so,
there
is
a
separation
and
yet
we
have
the
anomalous
situation
that
when
the
union
suffers
losses
and
therefore
the
system
suffers,
united's
rates
are
reduced.
this
not
only
mixes
the
jurisdictional
and
the
non-jurisdictional
impermissibly
but
also
is
even
reasonable
that
when
one
subsidiary
loses
the
other
must
have
lower
rates.
the
stockholders
on
the
other
hand
of
the
company
and
in
this
case
apparent
company
do
provide
the
capital
and
there,
the
losses
which
produce
the
tax
benefits
in
this
case.
now,
petitioners
make
a
point
of
saying
that
it's
the
profits
from
united's
gas
operations
which
provide
the
capital
is
simply
is
not
correctly
analytically
when
united
is
a
profitable
company,
it
does
so
on
a
regulated
basis
with
regulated
rates
and
any
funds
which
are
provided
to
the
parent
company
are
dividends
and
if
they
stay
with
the
parent
company
where
capital
experience
and
purposes
of
any
company
in
the
system
it
is
simply
because
the
stockholders
have
waived
their
right
to
take
them
as
dividends.
therefore,
very
clearly
that
capital
is
provided
by
the
stockholders.
they
take
the
risk
of
the
loss
company,
the
only
equitably
basis
would
be
that
they
also
achieve
the
tax
benefits
when
the
risked
companies
have
losses
and
therefore
produce
tax
benefits.
this
is
most
clearly
i
think
brought
out
in
this
case
of
a
minority
stock
holder
of
the
loss
company.
let's
assume
that
the
loss
company
in
the
system
has
minority
stockholders.
minority
stockholders
have
no
of
the
loss
subsidiary,
have
no
influence
on
the
activities
of
the
other
affiliates
in
the
system.
they
do
not
produce
the
situation
and
which
there
is
regulated
profit
to
offset.
they
do
not
achieve
any
of
the
games
from
the
regulated
profits
and
yet
under
the
fpc
system
the
tax
benefits
are
taken
away
from
the
loss
subsidiary
and
the
parent
because
they're
translated
over
into
rate
reductions
of
regulated
company.
again,
this
is
neither
jurisdictionally
valid
nor
good
regulatory
sense.
i
might
point
out
incidentally
that
when
the
losses
of
the
loss
companies
are
used
in
a
consolidated
basis,
the
parent's
basis
for
tax
purposes
games
or
losses
is
reduced,
the
basis
in
the
subsidiary.therefore,
these
losses
suffered
whether
their
real
losses
as
petitioners
like
to
refer
to
it
or
tax
deductible
losses
of
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
very
clearly
and
tangibles
are
quite
real.
in
any
case,
these
--
the
basis
on
the
subsidiary
is
reduced
and
therefore
there's
a
real
tangible
loss
produced
by
the
losses.
there
is
also
a
discrimination
against
companies
which
have
a
regulated
affiliate
produced
by
the
fpc
method.
a
oil
company
cannot
explore
and
compete
on
an
even
basis
when
another
oil
company
if
the
former
company
has
a
regulated
affiliate
because
it
knows
that
its
tax
cushion,
the
tax
offset
which
congress
granted
it
when
it
has
losses
will
be
taken
away
in
the
form
of
lower
rates
to
the
affiliate.
therefore,
there's
a
discrimination
against
the
risk
company
which
has
a
regulated
affiliate.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
clearly
a
frustration
of
the
congressional
intent
in
the
passage
of
the
consolidated
tax
provisions
which
were
to
treat
multi-corporate
systems
on
the
same
basis
single
cost
to
company
systems.
in
this
case,
the
incentive
to
take
risk
is
destroyed
by
the
fact
of
consolidated
tax
benefits
are
translated
into
rate
reductions
of
the
regulated
company.
i'd
finally
like
to
point
out
that
reversal
of
the
fpc
decision
in
other
words,
the
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
by
this
court
does
not
have
the
effect
of
raising
fpc
rates
beyond
their
normal
level.
it
simply
leaves
the
rates
if
the
level
that
they
have
historically
been
and
it
does
not
reduce
them
instead
it
allows
the
tax
offsets
granted
by
congress
to
the
parent
company
to
remain
with
the
parent
company,
the
parent
company
with
stockholders
being
those
who
bear
the
loss
of
the
risk
of
the
loss
operations.
the
fpc's
basic
premise
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
joint
cost
and
i
submit
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
joint
cost,
we
are
dealing
with
consolidated
tax
liability
which
is
separately
incurred.
it
is
nothing
more
than
the
sum
of
the
allocate
parts
and
the
portion
of
the
consolidated
tax
which
is
produced
by
the
regulated
company
is
the
sum
of
its
own
income
and
its
own
expenses
similarly
the
tax
saving
that's
referred
to
into
this
case
is
produced
by
the
losses
suffered
by
the
non-jurisdictional
operations
of
the
oil
company
and
this
is
also
separately
traceable.
the
general
principle
is
that
if
you
can
assign
the
results
of
a
regulatory
act
you
do
not
allocate
and
this
case
it's
quite
clear
that
you
can
trace
the
cost
of
the
losses,
the
non-jurisdictional
operations
and
therefore,
there
is
no
necessity
to
allocate
the
tax.
the
basic
claims
of
the
petitioners
are
practical
arguments
that
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
operations
of
the
union
and
united.
what
they
fell
to
point
out
is
that
almost
everyone
of
their
claims
some
of
them
are
factually
inaccurate
but
even
assuming
arguendo
that
they
were
accurate
almost
all
of
their
claims
go
the
gas
operations
of
union
and
that
is
not
the
operation
which
has
the
loss.
it
is
the
oil
operations
and
they
are
not
closely
related
in
any
way
even
if
related
this
way
relevant
factor.
basic
summary
of
this
case
then
is
i
think
that
all
parties
agree
that
the
method
used
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
case
is
in
error.
the
concessions
of
the
fpc
brief
make
that
clear.
therefore,
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
this
court
should
reverse
court
of
appeal
reinstate
the
federal
power
commission
decision
which
is
not
supported
by
either
the
commission
or
the
respondents.
second
step
would
be
if
we
were
to
go
beyond
that
point
whether
or
not
the
federal
power
commission
could
in
some
other
case
shape
a
jurisdictionally
valid
system.
i
submit
that
i've
shown
that
they
could
not.
if
the
court
reaches
that
question
then
we
must
deal
with
the
jurisdictional
violations
but
that
is
not
the
decision
of
the
fpc
in
this
case.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
concession
which
i
deal
with
mr.
chief
justice
is
at
page
10
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
at
page
15
of
the
brief
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
which
the
commission
states
that
there
are
indeed
problems
jurisdictional
problems
with
a
system
which
allocates
the
entire
loss
of
benefits
to
the
profit
companies
rather
than
splitting
them
sharing
as
they
say
between
the
profit
loss
companies.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
i
believe
mr.
fletcher
quoted
it
in
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
it
(voice
overlap).
one
final
point,
i
find
that
i
reminded
by
mr.
fletcher
and
yes,
we're
both
reminded
by
her
associates
that
i
made
a
misstatement
with
regard
to
the
--
an
allocations
under
1552
(a)
which
as
i
stated
were
irrelevant
but
used
only
for
purposes
of
earnings
and
profits.
the
method
used
is
not
invariably
assigned
52%
of
the
tax
to
united
and
the
tax
payment
follows
the
1552
method
so
that
in
some
years
it's
52%
and
some
that
is
not
for
the
five-year
period
in
question
i
find
it
was
49%.
i
was
not
informed
at
the
time
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
statement.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
start
by
referring
to
a
question
by
justice
white
relative
to
actual
taxes
in
what
united
the
regulated
company
actually
does.
the
fact
is
as
mr.
fletcher
summarized
that
united
reports
on
its
separate
return
which
is
consolidated
then
by
the
parent,
a
52%
tax
liability
and
does
in
fact
pay
a
check
which
is
transmitted
to
the
federal
government
for
that
52%
liability.
in
fact,
the
reason
that
this
case
is
here
is
that
the
federal
power
commission
objects
to
the
inter-company
transaction
to
the
way
and
which
the
company
files
and
pays
the
tax
does
not
believe
that
this
actual
tax
as
we
submit
it
is,
is
properly
applicable
to
the
united,
the
regulated
company
here
and
therefore
has
attacked
in
the
rate
regulation.
i'd
like
to
without
too
much
repetition
i
hope
stress
three
facts.
number
one,
under
the
federal
power
commission
method
here
in
question
it
is
union's
non-jurisdictional
oil
losses
which
cause
the
reduction
in
the
rates
of
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
united.
now,
this
is
key
to
this
case.
we
do
not
have
a
case
which
it
is
the
gas
operations
of
union
which
have
losses
and
therefore
the
el
paso
case
which
has
been
referred
to
is
wholly
irrelevant
here.
it
is
new
fact
non-jurisdictional
oil
losses
of
union
which
are
being
carried
over.
now,
this
fact
is
not
disputed.
staff
counsel
of
the
commission
level
conceded
that
it
was
a
use
of
oil
losses
and
that
shown
in
the
record,
volume
1,
page
120.
in
fact,
it
is
only
oil
losses.
there
are
no
gas
losses
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
exhibit
d
of
united's
brief
beside
the
appendix
to
united's
brief
which
is
supported
on
the
record.
and
the
commission
has
conceded
in
its
opinion
below
in
this
case
is
possible
to
separate
the
two
parts
of
union
between
gas
and
oil.
and
as
i've
indicated
it
is
the
oil
losses.
now,
justice
white
asked
at
one
point,
is
it
possible
for
a
regulated
company
to
have
a
loss?
it
is
of
could
well
have
and
then
in
some
of
these
years
the
gas
portion
of
union
had
some
losses
for
tax
purposes.
but
over
all,
over
the
representative
five-year
period,
it
did
not
so
we
are
dealing
only
with
none
jurisdictional
oil
losses.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
the
fpc
method
used
all
of
the
tax
reducing
results
of
the
losses
of
union's
oil
operations
to
reduce
the
rates
of
the
profit
companies.
that
means
the
fpc
jurisdictional
portion
of
united,
the
non-jurisdictional
portion
of
united
and
of
the
parent
company.
there
was
no
sharing
of
this
tax
benefit
between
the
loss
companies
which
produced
the
losses
which
made
the
tax
reduction
and
the
profit
companies.
number
three,
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
city
service
case
which
the
fpc
did
not
attempt
to
appeal
held
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
violation
again
there
was
not
a
holding
that
no
allocation
is
possible,
there
was
a
holding
that
the
allocation
method
applied
in
this
case
which
was
all
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
jurisdictional
violation
because
it
took
the
oil
losses
and
gave
all
of
the
benefits
to
the
profit
companies
including
the
regulated
portion
of
united.
the
court
of
appeals
also
did
not
hold
that
this
was
a
violation
because
union,
the
oil
and
gas
producer
was
unregulated
company
or
because
it
was
unrelated
to
united.
they
held
it's
clearly
and
wholly
on
the
jurisdictional
point
that
oil
losses
could
not
be
taken
across.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
choice
as
far
as
the
section
number
eludes
me
but
it
was
done
by
a
method
which
allocated
52%
of
the
separate
company
taxable
profit
of
united
to
united.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
actual
check
which
united
wrote
for
its
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it
is
my
understanding
of
that
section
which
i
do
not
consider
controlling
that
the
answer
of
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it
would've
permitted
it.
now,
if
that
method
which
did
as
you
state
will
set
result
had
been
then
used
for
rate
purposes.
it's
my
contention
that
it
would've
violated
the
jurisdictional
power
of
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
yes
your
honor,
i
do
not
rely
on
the
earnings
and
profits
allocation
method
on
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it's
permissible
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
it
is
if
we
refine
it
a
bit.
we
have
to
add
certain
facts.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
number
one,
is
the
regulated
portion
regulated
by
the
fpc
and
i'm
sure
that
you
used
the
term
to
mean
that
it
is.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
now,
in
that
case,
then
we
have
essentially
a
recreation
of
the
el
paso
case
has
been
referred
to
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
that
case,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
losses
could
be
carried
over
because
it
was
gas
losses
which
were
also
subject
to
the
fpc's
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
alight,
then
the
unregulated
portion
is
not
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
in
that
case
i
would
say
that
the
result
should
be
the
same
as
we
urge
here.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
you're
saying
now
--
in
other
words,
you're
going
again
to
your
point
of
does
the
fact
of
the
check
control.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
answer
of
your
question
is
yes,
because
the
results
of
the
regulate
portion
do
in
fact
increase
the
--
either
decrease
the
refund
or
increase
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
--
or
increase
the
liability
by
the
amount
of
52%.
the
non-jurisdictional
portion
should
not
be
brought
across.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
answer
is
yes
because
the
contrary
answer
would
violate
the
well-known
regulatory
principle
which
i
suppose
was
stated
most
clearly
in
justice
douglas
panhandle
opinion
that
you
cannot
use
non-jurisdictional
results
to
reduce
jurisdictional
rates.
now,
the
converse
of
this
is
that
the
jurisdictional
rates
are
not
increased
by
the
fact
of
losses
of
the
non-jurisdictional
companies.
these
are
kept
separate
statutorily
and
regulatory.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
you
mean
enter
into
a
consolidated
tax
return?
mr.
william
w.
brackett
to
keep
them
separately
completely
as
you're
stating
i
have
take
it
justice
--
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
they
are
mixed
only
in
a
sense
mr.
justice
white
of
having
been
joined
by
a
cover
sheet
in
the
consolidated
tax
return
but
the
components
which
produced
that
net
consolidated
tax
are
perfectly
clearly
computable
and
are
separately
cost
by
the
separate
operations
of
the
various
companies.
now,
fpc
in
its
brief
really
admits
that
the
commission
aired
in
its
opinion
number
428,
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
these
admissions
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
10
they
stated
that
there
may
indeed
be
problems
if
the
entire
savings
from
the
regulated
losses
are
allocated
to
the
profit
companies.
and
then
at
page
15
of
their
brief,
they
admitted
that
this
in
fact
occurred
that
the
whole
of
the
losses
were
taken
and
applied
against
the
profits
of
the
profit
companies
in
this
case,
the
regulated
company,
united
and
the
other
companies.
this
court
really
need
go
no
further
than
this
admission.
there
was
no
sharing
between
profit
and
loss
companies
and
therefore
no
party
to
this
case
is
supporting
the
fpc
decision
as
it
was
written.
what
the
fpc
and
memphis
are
doing
are
supporting
an
alternative
method
which
they
say
the
commission
could
have
used
but
did
not
in
this
case.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please
before
the
noon
recess,
i
think
i
hope
i
established
that
the
losses
which
the
federal
power
commission
is
taken
into
effect
to
reduce
the
jurisdictional
rates
of
united
are
losses
of
the
non-jurisdictional
activities
of
the
affiliate
union
and
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
admitted
the
jurisdictional
violation
that
the
method
which
it
used
in
this
case
and
the
only
method
therefore
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
not
before
this
court
does
violate
jurisdictional
power.
the
commission
however,
implicitly
suggests
in
its
brief
that
there
is
some
other
method
which
would
not
violate
the
commission's
jurisdiction
suggests
that
this
method
might
be
by
using
some
of
the
oil
losses
allocating
others
to
the
loss
companies.
although
it's
irrelevant
and
not
in
this
case
i'd
like
to
touch
on
that
because
analytically
it
goes
to
the
questions
which
have
been
discussed
by
the
other
parties.
in
the
first
place,
this
use
of
these
losses
would
also
be
a
violation
even
if
there
was
only
a
portion
of
the
losses
because
it
crosses
the
jurisdictional
boundaries
and
the
same
principles
applies,
it's
not
a
quantitative
principle,
it's
a
question
of
what
is
the
source
of
the
loss.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
i'd
like
to
answer
your
question
and
perhaps
the
assumption,
the
answer
of
your
question
is
yes.
we
look
to
the
jurisdictional
company
and
the
income
and
expenses
which
produces.
i
do
not
understand
mr.
justice
white
what
you
mean
by
predictably.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
corporate
system
in
which
united
is
44%
regulated
by
the
fpc,
56%
is
not,
the
parent
company
is
not
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
in
those
facts
which
do
not
pertain
here
the
jurisdictional
principle
nevertheless
cuts
across.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
commission's
attempt
to
support
a
method
which
was
not
used
here
as
wrong
in
principle.
there
is
also
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
made
a
second
admission
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
this
morning
went
to
that
point.
he
asked,
why
did
the
commission
in
its
city
service
opinion
and
then
again
in
this
united
opinion
here
rejects
its
own
steps
proposed
method.
let
me
state
the
fact,
the
fact
is
that
the
staff
said
that
these
tax
losses
from
non-jurisdictional
sources
should
be
spread
evenly
across
the
profit
companies
irrespective
or
whether
they
are
profit
companies
are
regulated
by
the
fpc
or
not.
in
other
words,
to
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
united
the
same
as
to
the
non-jurisdictional
portions
of
any
company
and
therefore
that
it
would
be
an
even
spreading.
the
commission
rejected
this
and
stated
as
its
principle
that
you
must
first
offset
the
none
jurisdictional
losses
against
--
i'm
sorry,
they
determined
the
use
was
none
regulated
losses
against
none
regulated
income
and
that
only
the
excess
could
be
carried
over
against
the
regulated
companies.
now,
--
mr.
william
w.
brackett
these
were
the
categories
of
the
commission
used,
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
recognition
of
the
boundaries
which
could
be
crossed
only
but
instead
only
a
partial
recognition
so
that
they
only
went
part
way
in
acceptance
of
the
jurisdictional
principles
because
as
i
stated
previously
crossing
the
jurisdictional
line
with
apportion
of
the
losses
is
also
a
violation.
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
in
fact
in
formulating
their
regulated
non-regulated
categories
of
the
companies
in
such
a
way
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
suggested
in
such
a
way
as
to
ignore
the
fpc
jurisdiction
and
to
sweep
in
to
the
regulated
category
companies
which
are
regulated
by
any
regulatory
agency.
the
commission
inevitably
set
up
a
method
which
ignores
its
own
jurisdiction
because
they
lump
together
as
in
the
regulated
category
companies
which
are
and
companies
which
are
not
and
portions
of
companies
which
are
not
regulated
by
the
fpc.
it
also
points
up
the
facts
that
had
the
commission
in
this
case
followed
the
theory
which
is
set
forth
of
offsetting
non-regulated
losses
against
rate
and
non-regulated
games.
had
they
followed
that
method
but
have
they
utilized
the
definition
of
regulated
which
followed
their
own
jurisdictional
limits
then
the
non-regulated
losses
from
the
oil
operations
of
union
would've
been
fully
used
up
by
offsetting
them
against
the
gas
operations
of
union
--
i'm
sorry,
against
the
non-regulated
gas
operations
of
united
and
non-jurisdictional
portion
which
were
sales
and
intrastate
commerce
or
even
more
clearly
by
offsetting
them
against
the
parent
company's
income
which
again
was
not
subject
to
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
so,
on
this
basis,
the
income
of
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
united
was
not
necessary
to
offset
the
losses
from
the
non-jurisdictional
oil
operations.
therefore,
we
have
two
violations
and
the
result
of
these
violations
is
to
produce
a
number
of
anomalies
and
inequities
and
regulation.
number
one,
the
jurisdictional
customers
of
united
did
not
pay
for
the
expenses
which
incurred
the
losses
of
union's
oil
operations.
federal
power
commission
in
allocating
cost
clearly
allocates
in
this
case
united
and
union
are
not
even
regulated
in
the
same
rate
cases.
so,
there
is
a
separation
and
yet
we
have
the
anomalous
situation
that
when
the
union
suffers
losses
and
therefore
the
system
suffers,
united's
rates
are
reduced.
this
not
only
mixes
the
jurisdictional
and
the
non-jurisdictional
impermissibly
but
also
is
even
reasonable
that
when
one
subsidiary
loses
the
other
must
have
lower
rates.
the
stockholders
on
the
other
hand
of
the
company
and
in
this
case
apparent
company
do
provide
the
capital
and
there,
the
losses
which
produce
the
tax
benefits
in
this
case.
now,
petitioners
make
a
point
of
saying
that
it's
the
profits
from
united's
gas
operations
which
provide
the
capital
is
simply
is
not
correctly
analytically
when
united
is
a
profitable
company,
it
does
so
on
a
regulated
basis
with
regulated
rates
and
any
funds
which
are
provided
to
the
parent
company
are
dividends
and
if
they
stay
with
the
parent
company
where
capital
experience
and
purposes
of
any
company
in
the
system
it
is
simply
because
the
stockholders
have
waived
their
right
to
take
them
as
dividends.
therefore,
very
clearly
that
capital
is
provided
by
the
stockholders.
they
take
the
risk
of
the
loss
company,
the
only
equitably
basis
would
be
that
they
also
achieve
the
tax
benefits
when
the
risked
companies
have
losses
and
therefore
produce
tax
benefits.
this
is
most
clearly
i
think
brought
out
in
this
case
of
a
minority
stock
holder
of
the
loss
company.
let's
assume
that
the
loss
company
in
the
system
has
minority
stockholders.
minority
stockholders
have
no
of
the
loss
subsidiary,
have
no
influence
on
the
activities
of
the
other
affiliates
in
the
system.
they
do
not
produce
the
situation
and
which
there
is
regulated
profit
to
offset.
they
do
not
achieve
any
of
the
games
from
the
regulated
profits
and
yet
under
the
fpc
system
the
tax
benefits
are
taken
away
from
the
loss
subsidiary
and
the
parent
because
they're
translated
over
into
rate
reductions
of
regulated
company.
again,
this
is
neither
jurisdictionally
valid
nor
good
regulatory
sense.
i
might
point
out
incidentally
that
when
the
losses
of
the
loss
companies
are
used
in
a
consolidated
basis,
the
parent's
basis
for
tax
purposes
games
or
losses
is
reduced,
the
basis
in
the
subsidiary.therefore,
these
losses
suffered
whether
their
real
losses
as
petitioners
like
to
refer
to
it
or
tax
deductible
losses
of
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
very
clearly
and
tangibles
are
quite
real.
in
any
case,
these
--
the
basis
on
the
subsidiary
is
reduced
and
therefore
there's
a
real
tangible
loss
produced
by
the
losses.
there
is
also
a
discrimination
against
companies
which
have
a
regulated
affiliate
produced
by
the
fpc
method.
a
oil
company
cannot
explore
and
compete
on
an
even
basis
when
another
oil
company
if
the
former
company
has
a
regulated
affiliate
because
it
knows
that
its
tax
cushion,
the
tax
offset
which
congress
granted
it
when
it
has
losses
will
be
taken
away
in
the
form
of
lower
rates
to
the
affiliate.
therefore,
there's
a
discrimination
against
the
risk
company
which
has
a
regulated
affiliate.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
clearly
a
frustration
of
the
congressional
intent
in
the
passage
of
the
consolidated
tax
provisions
which
were
to
treat
multi-corporate
systems
on
the
same
basis
single
cost
to
company
systems.
in
this
case,
the
incentive
to
take
risk
is
destroyed
by
the
fact
of
consolidated
tax
benefits
are
translated
into
rate
reductions
of
the
regulated
company.
i'd
finally
like
to
point
out
that
reversal
of
the
fpc
decision
in
other
words,
the
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
by
this
court
does
not
have
the
effect
of
raising
fpc
rates
beyond
their
normal
level.
it
simply
leaves
the
rates
if
the
level
that
they
have
historically
been
and
it
does
not
reduce
them
instead
it
allows
the
tax
offsets
granted
by
congress
to
the
parent
company
to
remain
with
the
parent
company,
the
parent
company
with
stockholders
being
those
who
bear
the
loss
of
the
risk
of
the
loss
operations.
the
fpc's
basic
premise
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
joint
cost
and
i
submit
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
joint
cost,
we
are
dealing
with
consolidated
tax
liability
which
is
separately
incurred.
it
is
nothing
more
than
the
sum
of
the
allocate
parts
and
the
portion
of
the
consolidated
tax
which
is
produced
by
the
regulated
company
is
the
sum
of
its
own
income
and
its
own
expenses
similarly
the
tax
saving
that's
referred
to
into
this
case
is
produced
by
the
losses
suffered
by
the
non-jurisdictional
operations
of
the
oil
company
and
this
is
also
separately
traceable.
the
general
principle
is
that
if
you
can
assign
the
results
of
a
regulatory
act
you
do
not
allocate
and
this
case
it's
quite
clear
that
you
can
trace
the
cost
of
the
losses,
the
non-jurisdictional
operations
and
therefore,
there
is
no
necessity
to
allocate
the
tax.
the
basic
claims
of
the
petitioners
are
practical
arguments
that
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
operations
of
the
union
and
united.
what
they
fell
to
point
out
is
that
almost
everyone
of
their
claims
some
of
them
are
factually
inaccurate
but
even
assuming
arguendo
that
they
were
accurate
almost
all
of
their
claims
go
the
gas
operations
of
union
and
that
is
not
the
operation
which
has
the
loss.
it
is
the
oil
operations
and
they
are
not
closely
related
in
any
way
even
if
related
this
way
relevant
factor.
basic
summary
of
this
case
then
is
i
think
that
all
parties
agree
that
the
method
used
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
case
is
in
error.
the
concessions
of
the
fpc
brief
make
that
clear.
therefore,
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
this
court
should
reverse
court
of
appeal
reinstate
the
federal
power
commission
decision
which
is
not
supported
by
either
the
commission
or
the
respondents.
second
step
would
be
if
we
were
to
go
beyond
that
point
whether
or
not
the
federal
power
commission
could
in
some
other
case
shape
a
jurisdictionally
valid
system.
i
submit
that
i've
shown
that
they
could
not.
if
the
court
reaches
that
question
then
we
must
deal
with
the
jurisdictional
violations
but
that
is
not
the
decision
of
the
fpc
in
this
case.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
the
concession
which
i
deal
with
mr.
chief
justice
is
at
page
10
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
at
page
15
of
the
brief
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
which
the
commission
states
that
there
are
indeed
problems
jurisdictional
problems
with
a
system
which
allocates
the
entire
loss
of
benefits
to
the
profit
companies
rather
than
splitting
them
sharing
as
they
say
between
the
profit
loss
companies.
mr.
william
w.
brackett
i
believe
mr.
fletcher
quoted
it
in
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
it
(voice
overlap).
one
final
point,
i
find
that
i
reminded
by
mr.
fletcher
and
yes,
we're
both
reminded
by
her
associates
that
i
made
a
misstatement
with
regard
to
the
--
an
allocations
under
1552
(a)
which
as
i
stated
were
irrelevant
but
used
only
for
purposes
of
earnings
and
profits.
the
method
used
is
not
invariably
assigned
52%
of
the
tax
to
united
and
the
tax
payment
follows
the
1552
method
so
that
in
some
years
it's
52%
and
some
that
is
not
for
the
five-year
period
in
question
i
find
it
was
49%.
i
was
not
informed
at
the
time
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
statement.
