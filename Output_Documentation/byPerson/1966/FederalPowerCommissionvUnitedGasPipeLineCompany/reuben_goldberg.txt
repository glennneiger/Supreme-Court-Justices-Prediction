mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
before
launching
into
our
argument
the
court's
convenience
and
information,
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
printed
record
at
page
24
of
volume
2,
there
appears
the
reproduction
of
an
exhibit
presented
by
the
petitioner
memphis
in
that
case
which
shows
the
taxable
income
or
tax
loss
situation
during
the
representative
period
in
those
cases.
i
mentioned
that
reference
because
it
has
been
referred
to
by
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
his
argument.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
volume
2,
it's
all
in
one
on
a
printed
record,
volume
2
of
the
lower
court
record
has
been
incorporated.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
page
24.
i
might
also
say
mr.
justice
white
that
if
a
regulated
company
is
suffering
real
losses
not
tax
losses,
it
means
that
it
needs
a
rate
increase
so
that
it
will
be
earning
a
fair
return
and
recover
all
of
its
operating
costs.
in
that
situation,
if
the
case
were
before
the
federal
power
commission,
the
commission
would
determine
what
the
fair
return
is
and
what
recovery
of
operating
expenses
are
required
and
on
the
basis
of
that
income
determine
what
actual
tax
liability
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--
there
would
then
be
and
it
will
allow
it
in
the
cost
of
service.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
if
the
commission
has
correctly
forecast
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
if
they
haven't,
the
losses
would
continue
and
there
has
to
be
a
further
review
of
the
rates.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
only
because
the
forecast
as
to
the
future
doesn't
turn
out
that
way
and
if
it
turns
out
that
in
fact
the
tax
liability
is
less
than
the
commission
had
forecast
and
this
indicates
that
there
ought
to
be
a
rate
reduction
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
review
it.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
it
is
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
precisely
and
the
commission
used
this
five-year
span
rather
than
the
single
span
to
try
to
be
as
certain
as
it
could
be
in
forecasting
that
this
would
be
the
actual
situation.
the
legislative
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
under
which
this
case
arises
is
unusually
informative
and
instructive
on
the
very
issue
in
this
case.
it
informs
and
instructs
that
the
commission's
treatment
of
the
tax-saving
resulting
from
the
consolidated
income
tax
return
is
fully
authorized
and
sound
and
that
the
treatment
contended
for
--
by
united
in
this
case
was
regarded
by
congress
as
detrimental
to
consumers
and
was
intended
to
be
prevented
by
the
commission
in
the
administration
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
relevant
history
of
the
act
begins
with
the
federal
trade
commission's
comprehensive
investigation
of
the
electric
and
gas
industry
in
the
1930's.
that
investigation
revealed
that
when
the
consolidated
tax
return
was
filed
by
an
affiliated
group
of
companies,
it
was
the
practice
of
the
parent
to
deny
any
share
of
the
tax
savings
to
the
subsidiaries.
what
the
parent
did
was
to
appropriate
all
of
the
tax
saving
to
itself
as
profit
and
it
accomplish
this
by
requiring
these
subsidiaries
to
pay
to
the
parent
an
amount
of
federal
income
taxes
which
the
parent
would
have
paid
if
instead
of
joining
in
a
consolidated
return
it
had
filed
a
separate
tax
return.
and
by
this
device
the
parent
then
collected
from
the
group
an
amount
for
federal
income
taxes
in
excess
of
the
actual
taxes
paid
to
the
treasury
department
and
the
difference
was
pocketed
by
the
parent
this
profit.
at
the
same
time,
the
subsidiary
recorded
the
amount
have
paid
the
parent
in
its
accounts
as
its
federal
income
tax
cost
and
regulatory
commissions
in
fixing
rates
required
the
consumers
to
pay
rates
based
upon
this
tax
which
was
never
paid
by
anyone
to
the
united
states
treasury.
the
trade
commission
reported
to
congress
that
the
operating
expenses
of
the
subsidiaries
were
thus
inflated,
that
was
the
word
they
used,
and
the
inaccurately
recorded
again
using
their
words
of
the
true
cost
of
operations.
and
congress
was
informed
that
the
operating
subsidiaries
were
"entitled
to
the
benefit
of
any
tax
savings
to
the
group
due
to
the
filing
of
a
consolidated
income
tax
return."
they
went
on
to
say
that
this
should
be
done
on
the
basis
of
a
proportion
of
the
taxable
income
and
i
might
address
for
a
moment
to
say
this
is
precisely
the
end-result
of
the
commission's
method
of
allocation
in
this
case.
the
trade
commission
recommended
the
enactment
of
remedial
legislation
to
curve
and
prevent
this
and
other
financial
and
accounting
practices
which
should
describe
as
the
detrimental
to
the
consumers.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
the
hope
case,
reported
in
320
u.s.referring
to
the
natural
gas
act
using
his
words
congress
addressed
itself
to
these
"specific
evils."
to
prevent
this
exploitation
of
consumers
by
this
practice
and
others
congress
armed
the
commission
with
comprehensive
rate
making
powers
and
these
are
revealed
in
sections
4
and
5
of
the
act
and
additionally,
it
gave
the
commission
complete
control
of
what
was
to
be
recorded
in
the
accounts
of
the
natural
gas
companies
in
section
8
of
the
act
and
they
went
so
far
as
to
even
give
the
commission
the
power
to
examine
the
records
of
affiliated
companies
even
though
they
were
unregulated
with
respect
to
transactions
that
bore
on
the
business
of
the
regulated
company.
as
congress
intended
and
as
the
commission's
statutory
authority
contemplated.
the
commission
with
court
approval
through
the
years
has
given
no
order
to
fictitious
cost
in
accounting
and
in
rate
making
has
steadfastly
refused
to
settle
consumers
with
fictitious
cost
including
fictitious
tax
loss.
and
where
the
natural
gas
company
has
participated
in
a
consolidated
tax
return
the
commission
in
fixing
the
regulated
utilities
rates
has
refused
to
include
a
hypothetical
tax
allowance
based
on
a
separate
tax
return
basis
as
in
this
case
it
has
included
in
the
cost
of
service
only
a
tax
allowance
at
the
effective
tax
rate
resulting
from
participation
in
the
consolidated
tax
return.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
they
mentioned
one
case,
if
i
recall.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
argued
that
the
case
as
we
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief
are
not
cases
which
involved
non-regulated
tax
losses
but
they
are
in
error.
the
cases
which
involved
companies
of
the
columbia
gas
system
in
that
list
of
cases
for
example
the
atlantic
seaboard
corporation,
united
fuel
gas
company,
cone
gas
company,
i
think
penn-york
is
another,
involved
a
group
of
companies
one
of
which
at
least
was
a
non-regulated
oil
company.
so,
we
have
precisely
the
same
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
any
deviation
from
that
long
established
practice
that
was
only
in
the
owen
case
that
was
decided
in
1957
is
reported
in
17
fpc
at
685.
and
in
that
case,
the
commission
in
its
opinion
described
the
circumstances
of
the
case
as
and
i
use
the
commission's
words,
well
not
unique
and
the
case
itself
virtually
sui
generis,
the
end
of
the
commission's
quotation.
and
the
commission
went
on
in
that
case
at
page
696
of
its
reports
to
say
that
the
examiner's
decision
in
their
case
and
its
own
decision
were
not
to
"stand
as
president
for
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
future
case."
so
that
i
think
we
may
fairly
say
that
except
to
that
case
which
the
commission
said
wasn't
to
be
a
precedent.
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case
in
insisting
upon
including
in
cost
of
service
and
imposing
upon
consumers
in
rates
only
an
actual
tax
liability
that
it
has
been
a
long
established
consistent
administrative
practice
and
memphis
submits
if
the
court
please
that
if
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
permitted
to
stand
we
will
have
returned
to
the
practices
detrimental
to
consumers
which
the
trade
commission
condemn
and
which
congress
acting
on
the
trade
commission's
recommendations
wanted
to
prevent
by
passing
the
natural
gas
act
as
well
as
parts
2
and
3
of
the
federal
power
act
in
1935
and
the
public
--
the
holding
company
act
with
respect
to
holding
companies
and
that's
because
united
wants
the
consumers
to
pay
in
rates
a
tax
that
is
not
paid
to
the
treasury
and
which
united's
own
brief
and
it
seems
to
us
concedes
will
simply
mean
additional
profit
to
the
parent
united
gas
corporations.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
a
balance
sheet
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
an
operating
statement
prepared
by
the
certified
public
accountant.
he
would
probably
reflect
what
the
company
had
done
or
the
group
had
done
amongst
themselves
under
the
tax
loss
it
would
have
to
be
an
allocation
which
allocation
is
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
what
he
would
report
went
out
as
taxes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
actual
cash
transferred
from
the
subsidiary
to
the
parent.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
it
would
be
whatever
the
parent
had
dictated
should
be
done
to
the
subsidiary
and
in
the
days
before
the
natural
gas
act
the
parent
dictated
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
even
today
unless
the
federal
power
commission's
regulation
is
involved
the
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
to
the
treasury?
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
preparing
a
proper
operating
statement
it
should
show
federal
income
taxes
only
at
this
$25,000.00.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
hope
we're
together
on
this
and
just
to
be
sure
we
are
may
i
try
to
state
what
my
understanding
of
the
situation
is.
if
we
have
a
regulated
company
or
a
company,
paying
taxes
itself
on
a
separate
tax
return
basis,
its
tax
is
whatever
the
taxable
income
is
times
the
governed
corporate
rate
and
that's
reflected
in
its
accounts.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that
would
be
reflected
in
its
account
as
federal
income
taxes
and
its
accounts
would
probably
also
show
the
disbursement
of
the
--
a
reduction
in
cash
by
$50,000.00.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
other
situation
that
you
were
opposing
for
me.
is
it
the
same
company
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
in
the
actual
facts
in
this
case
are
that
as
between
the
parent
and
subsidiary,
the
transfer
of
cash
from
the
subsidiary
to
the
parent
for
federal
income
taxes
was
at
less
than
the
52%
rate.
and
actually,
i
think
at
a
rate
of
48
--
an
effective
rate
of
49%
whereas
the
commission
has
used
in
effective
rate
are
reason
of
its
test
period
of
50.04%.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
at
the
49%
rate.
i
guess
my
time
is,
very
much,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
before
launching
into
our
argument
the
court's
convenience
and
information,
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
printed
record
at
page
24
of
volume
2,
there
appears
the
reproduction
of
an
exhibit
presented
by
the
petitioner
memphis
in
that
case
which
shows
the
taxable
income
or
tax
loss
situation
during
the
representative
period
in
those
cases.
i
mentioned
that
reference
because
it
has
been
referred
to
by
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
his
argument.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
volume
2,
it's
all
in
one
on
a
printed
record,
volume
2
of
the
lower
court
record
has
been
incorporated.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
page
24.
i
might
also
say
mr.
justice
white
that
if
a
regulated
company
is
suffering
real
losses
not
tax
losses,
it
means
that
it
needs
a
rate
increase
so
that
it
will
be
earning
a
fair
return
and
recover
all
of
its
operating
costs.
in
that
situation,
if
the
case
were
before
the
federal
power
commission,
the
commission
would
determine
what
the
fair
return
is
and
what
recovery
of
operating
expenses
are
required
and
on
the
basis
of
that
income
determine
what
actual
tax
liability
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--
there
would
then
be
and
it
will
allow
it
in
the
cost
of
service.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
if
the
commission
has
correctly
forecast
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
if
they
haven't,
the
losses
would
continue
and
there
has
to
be
a
further
review
of
the
rates.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
only
because
the
forecast
as
to
the
future
doesn't
turn
out
that
way
and
if
it
turns
out
that
in
fact
the
tax
liability
is
less
than
the
commission
had
forecast
and
this
indicates
that
there
ought
to
be
a
rate
reduction
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
review
it.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
it
is
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
precisely
and
the
commission
used
this
five-year
span
rather
than
the
single
span
to
try
to
be
as
certain
as
it
could
be
in
forecasting
that
this
would
be
the
actual

this
practice
and
others
congress
armed
the
commission
with
comprehensive
rate
making
powers
and
these
are
revealed
in
sections
4
and
5
of
the
act
and
additionally,
it
gave
the
commission
complete
control
of
what
was
to
be
recorded
in
the
accounts
of
the
natural
gas
companies
in
section
8
of
the
act
and
they
went
so
far
as
to
even
give
the
commission
the
power
to
examine
the
records
of
affiliated
companies
even
though
they
were
unregulated
with
respect
to
transactions
that
bore
on
the
business
of
the
regulated
company.
as
congress
intended
and
as
the
commission's
statutory
authority
contemplated.
the
commission
with
court
approval
through
the
years
has
given
no
order
to
fictitious
cost
in
accounting
and
in
rate
making
has
steadfastly
refused
to
settle
consumers
with
fictitious
cost
including
fictitious
tax
loss.
and
where
the
natural
gas
company
has
participated
in
a
consolidated
tax
return
the
commission
in
fixing
the
regulated
utilities
rates
has
refused
to
include
a
hypothetical
tax
allowance
based
on
a
separate
tax
return
basis
as
in
this
case
it
has
included
in
the
cost
of
service
only
a
tax
allowance
at
the
effective
tax
rate
resulting
from
participation
in
the
consolidated
tax
return.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
they
mentioned
one
case,
if
i
recall.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
argued
that
the
case
as
we
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief
are
not
cases
which
involved
non-regulated
tax
losses
but
they
are
in
error.
the
cases
which
involved
companies
of
the
columbia
gas
system
in
that
list
of
cases
for
example
the
atlantic
seaboard
corporation,
united
fuel
gas
company,
cone
gas
company,
i
think
penn-york
is
another,
involved
a
group
of
companies
one
of
which
at
least
was
a
non-regulated
oil
company.
so,
we
have
precisely
the
same
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
any
deviation
from
that
long
established
practice
that
was
only
in
the
owen
case
that
was
decided
in
1957
is
reported
in
17
fpc
at
685.
and
in
that
case,
the
commission
in
its
opinion
described
the
circumstances
of
the
case
as
and
i
use
the
commission's
words,
well
not
unique
and
the
case
itself
virtually
sui
generis,
the
end
of
the
commission's
quotation.
and
the
commission
went
on
in
that
case
at
page
696
of
its
reports
to
say
that
the
examiner's
decision
in
their
case
and
its
own
decision
were
not
to
"stand
as
president
for
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
future
case."
so
that
i
think
we
may
fairly
say
that
except
to
that
case
which
the
commission
said
wasn't
to
be
a
precedent.
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case
in
insisting
upon
including
in
cost
of
service
and
imposing
upon
consumers
in
rates
only
an
actual
tax
liability
that
it
has
been
a
long
established
consistent
administrative
practice
and
memphis
submits
if
the
court
please
that
if
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
permitted
to
stand
we
will
have
returned
to
the
practices
detrimental
to
consumers
which
the
trade
commission
condemn
and
which
congress
acting
on
the
trade
commission's
recommendations
wanted
to
prevent
by
passing
the
natural
gas
act
as
well
as
parts
2
and
3
of
the
federal
power
act
in
1935
and
the
public
--
the
holding
company
act
with
respect
to
holding
companies
and
that's
because
united
wants
the
consumers
to
pay
in
rates
a
tax
that
is
not
paid
to
the
treasury
and
which
united's
own
brief
and
it
seems
to
us
concedes
will
simply
mean
additional
profit
to
the
parent
united
gas
corporations.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
a
balance
sheet
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
an
operating
statement
prepared
by
the
certified
public
accountant.
he
would
probably
reflect
what
the
company
had
done
or
the
group
had
done
amongst
themselves
under
the
tax
loss
it
would
have
to
be
an
allocation
which
allocation
is
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
what
he
would
report
went
out
as
taxes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
actual
cash
transferred
from
the
subsidiary
to
the
parent.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
it
would
be
whatever
the
parent
had
dictated
should
be
done
to
the
subsidiary
and
in
the
days
before
the
natural
gas
act
the
parent
dictated
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
even
today
unless
the
federal
power
commission's
regulation
is
involved
the
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
to
the
treasury?
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
preparing
a
proper
operating
statement
it
should
show
federal
income
taxes
only
at
this
$25,000.00.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
hope
we're
together
on
this
and
just
to
be
sure
we
are
may
i
try
to
state
what
my
understanding
of
the
situation
is.
if
we
have
a
regulated
company
or
a
company,
paying
taxes
itself
on
a
separate
tax
return
basis,
its
tax
is
whatever
the
taxable
income
is
times
the
governed
corporate
rate
and
that's
reflected
in
its
accounts.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that
would
be
reflected
in
its
account
as
federal
income
taxes
and
its
accounts
would
probably
also
show
the
disbursement
of
the
--
a
reduction
in
cash
by
$50,000.00.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
other
situation
that
you
were
opposing
for
me.
is
it
the
same
company
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
in
the
actual
facts
in
this
case
are
that
as
between
the
parent
and
subsidiary,
the
transfer
of
cash
from
the
subsidiary
to
the
parent
for
federal
income
taxes
was
at
less
than
the
52%
rate.
and
actually,
i
think
at
a
rate
of
48
--
an
effective
rate
of
49%
whereas
the
commission
has
used
in
effective
rate
are
reason
of
its
test
period
of
50.04%.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
at
the
49%
rate.
i
guess
my
time
is,
very
much,
my
time
is
up.
