there's
another
consolidated
company
in
here
too,
its
overseas
or
somebody?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
producing
company
which
has
got
the
live
share
of
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
seem
to
remember
in
the
briefs
that
your
co-counsel
in
the
other
side
don't
agree
with
you
about
the
commission
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
they
said,
there's
only
one
case
that
seems
to
look
in
your
favor,
they
mentioned
several
cases
on
the
other
side
if
i
remember
correctly
from
the
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fletcher,
i
want
to
make
clear
what
you
say
the
commission
concedes
on
its
brief
on
page
15.
justice
potter
stewart
what
language
you
were
referring
to?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
petition
it's
note
8,
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
8
on
page
10?
justice
potter
stewart
its
parenthetical
material
that
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
referred
to
on
page
15
of
the
brief.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
surely.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
facts
in
this
record
show
that
of
the
five-year
period
take
there
was
only
one
year
and
which
union
showed
any
profit
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
very
small
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
$24,000.00
or
$25,000.00
or
something
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
have
overseas
in
my?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
losses
average
over
the
four-year
period
how
much
a
year?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
on
this
record,
on
the
facts
of
this
record
it's
a
little
hard
to
be
sure
you
can't
do
more
than
speculate
as
to
whether
or
not
union
actually
could
of
taking
itself
advantage
of
the
carry
back
and
carry
forward
provision.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
no
question
about
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
they're
being
able
to
do
it
if
there
were
profits
against
wish
to
take
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
depends
upon
questions
of
fact?
