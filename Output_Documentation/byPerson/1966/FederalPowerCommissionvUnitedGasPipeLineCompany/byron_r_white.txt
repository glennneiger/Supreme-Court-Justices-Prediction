justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
producing
companies
the
one
that
in
this
case
that
is
responsible
for
the
losses?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
source
of
loss
in
the
producing
company,
this
what
--
there
were
declaration
expenses
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
account
separately
for
the
--
in
making
rates
for
the
regulated
business
and
the
unregulated?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
isn't
there
--
is
there
another
answer
to
that
claim?
let's
assume
it's
true,
absolutely
true
that
the
union
could
have
absorbed
all
of
these
losses
and
put
his
income
to
do
it,
there
is
no
question
that
the
--
is
that
critical
in
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
that
some
of
the
losses
have
been
charged
against
the
regulator.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
the
consolidated
return
to
reduce
the
taxes
of
the
regulated
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
some
of
the
losses
are
charged
to
get
it
against
of
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
rate
on
this
--
on
the
government's
basis
the
rates
have
to
change
every
year
when
the
business
fortunes
of
related
companies
keep
changing,
sometimes
they
have
income,
sometimes
they
don't
if
all
the
entities
in
this
consolidated
group
had
income,
i
suppose
the
regulated
company
would
have
some
tax
to
pay
perhaps
52%of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
a
single
entity,
suppose
one
corporation
has
the
regulated
department
in
a
non-regulated
department
then
the
unregulated
department
has
the
losses
and
the
corporation
pays
no
tax
because
of
those
losses.
i
suppose
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
that,
don't
you?
or
do
you
have
any
such
experience?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would,
it
would
sound
like
in
a
fortiori
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
an
unregulated
business
ever
have
a
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
an
unregulated
--
does
a
regulated
business
ever
have
a
loss
at
the
end
of
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
gather
it's
just
academic
to
ask
you,
what
you
do
about
this
problem
that
if
the
regulated
company
has
a
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
if
a
regulated
company
did
have
a
loss
over
every
year
for
five
years
you
would
still
allow
that
tax
--
in
setting
rates
you'd
still
allow
the
tax
benefit
even
though
they
paid
no
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
the
--
how
does
the
regulated
company
then
ever
get
its
rate
up
to
what
they
ought
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
regulated
company
is
losing
money
because
of
insufficient
income,
i
would
suppose
its
rates
are
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
in
this
case.
this
is
different
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think
intangible
drilling
costs
aren't
real
losses?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
certainly
cost
a
lot
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
volume
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
and
it
would
go
on
allowing
it
even
though
the
company
continued
to
have
losses
because
somebody
has
made
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
think
let's
assume
they
haven't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yes,
and
they
would
--
but
they
would
continue
to
allow
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
give
them
a
tax.
now,
the
only
point
being
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
the
tax
factor
its
calculated
in
the
rate
although
the
tax
has
been
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
position
is
in
this
case
that
the
five-year-period
is
a
forecast?
justice
byron
r.
white
really,
it
has
to
forecast
as
to
what
tax
liability
actually
will
be
in
the
future.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
goldberg,
how
does
on
the
regulated
companies
actual,
let's
say
it's
a
profit
and
loss
statement
at
the
end
of
the
year.
say
a
certified
accountant
was
certified
to
what
its
income
--
that
income
was
at
the
end
of
the
year.
what
figure
would
it
show
as
for
taxes
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
an
operating
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
an
allocation
but
the
--
in
terms
of
this
one
company
how
much
cash
tax
actually
goes
out?
it's
only
it's
out
of
the
share
of
the
taxes
that
actually
goes
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
operating
statement
would
just
show
that
the
actual
tax
expense
or
the
tax
charge
begins
income
with
only
be
the
actual
cash
outgo
for
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
would
only
--
so,
it
wouldn't
be
52%
it
would
be
50%.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
talking
about
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
take
a
(inaudible)
assume
that
without
the
consolidated
statement
incorporate
that
the
regulated
company
would
have
paid
$50,000.00
to
federal
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
treasury.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
consolidated
statement
if
share
of
net
of
income
taxes
is
$25,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
its
own
accounting
would
show
just
the
actual
cash
outlay
for
taxes
and
it
thus
increases
its
net
income,
i
mean
this
consolidated
return
increases
its
own
net
income
available
for
dividend
as
compared
with
non-consolidated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that's
$50,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
supposing
the
actual
facts
in
this
case
then
where
there
is
a
consolidated
return
not
a
separate
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
would
its
accounting,
its
certified
public
accountant
say
its
tax
cost
was
for
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
fletcher,
excuse
me
please.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
the
commission
has
incorrectly
determined
the
actual
tax
cost
to
the
regulated
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
this
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
incorrectly
determined
what
the
actual
out
of
pocket
tax
cost
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
now,
is
united
gas
line
is
that
the
regulated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
the
one
whose
rate
is
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
--
do
you
say
that
united
actually
had
a
cash
out
way
of
52%
for
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
argument,
i'm
just
wondering
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
the
losses
which
--
was
a
matter
of
fact
in
filing
on
a
consolidated
basis
saved
the
regulated
company
any
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
now,
let's
carry
it
on
a
little
more
--
if
united,
the
regulated
company
had
filed
separately
it
would've
paid
52%
and
you
say
it
wrote
a
check
for
that
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
government
or
to
the
parent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
doesn't
the
parent
pay
the
consolidated
tax
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
mechanically
they
allocated
that
from
consolidated
return
purpose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
took
the
total
income
and
offset
it
by
the
losses
of
the
group
and
the
net
result
has
the
federal
tax
rate
replied
to
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
amount
is
then
allocated
back
to
the
company,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
federal
tax
laws
the
regulated
company
in
the,
assume
the
out
share
of
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
brackett,
the
point
you
--
section
1552
says
that
pursuant
to
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
the
earnings
and
profits
of
each
member
of
an
affiliated
group
required
to
be
included
in
the
consolidated
return
shall
be
allocated
and
in
accordance
with
one
of
four
different
methods
available.
now,
anyone
could
read
those
sections
then
it
requires
that
you
chose
the
--
not
that
you
want
to
allocate
the
tax
liability
and
if
you
don't
choose
why
it's
by
1552
(a)
(1)
i
gather.
now,
how
in
this
case
or
was
the
choice
made
of
allocating
the
tax
liability
under
section
1552?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
it
must
--
that
is
not
one
of
the
way
that
it's
expressly
listed
but
so
it
must
have
been
under
four,
the
tax
liability
of
the
group
shall
be
allocated
in
the
court
of
any
other
methods
selected
by
the
group.
in
any
event,
the
actual
check
to
be
wrote
print
to
the
united
states
was
52%.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
concede
for
the
moment
that
an
allocation
could
have
been
made
consistent
with
section
1552
which
would
have
reduced
the
actual
tax
cost
to
united
below
52%?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
so
that
the
1552
would've
permitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
wouldn't
make
--
you
would
make
the
same
argument
no
matter
what
the
method
of
allocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
that
is
it
permissible
for
us
to
think
about
this
case
in
terms
of
a
single
company
that
has
both
regulated
and
unregulated
business
and
they
were
unregulated
business
having
losses
and
the
regulated
business
having
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
decent
model
with
this
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
fpc
regulated
portion
is
that
you
say
that
the
unregulated
portion
is
an
exploration,
the
exploration
operation
and
there
are
intangible
drilling
costs
and
its
producing
operation
and
there
is
consequently
depletion.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
the
company
predictably
would
pay
no
tax
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
saying
that
if
it's
all
one
entity
and
predictably
there
are
going
to
be
sufficient
intangible
drilling
costs
over
a
period
of
the
years
to
reduce
the
tax
of
this
single
entity
to
zero
every
year
predictably
and
everybody
agreed,
they'll
pay
no
tax
for
the
next
10
years.
you
would
say
on
your
argument
nevertheless
and
nevertheless
that
the
rate
structure
of
the
company
should
be
set
to
reflect
a
tax
cost
of
52%
of
the
regulated
companies
or
regulated
divisions
earning.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
i
think
i'm
clear
enough
now
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
just
to
make
it
clear,
if
on
a
consolidated
return
there
was
no
consolidated
that
income
and
hence
no
tax
to
be
allocated
or
paid
by
anybody
and
predictably
that
would
be
true
for
future.
you
would
say
that
nevertheless
the
regulated
company
should
be
allowed
52%
tax
credit
for
making
it
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
can
understand
you
could
make
an
issue
on
whether
or
not
the
fpc
correctly
concluded
that
the
--
that
there
would
or
wouldn't
be
losses
or
would
or
wouldn't
be
income
but
that's
the
factual
determination
i
suppose
but
let's
just
assume
the
you
could
predict
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
consolidated
net
income
for
the
next
10
years
and
everybody
admits
to
assume
everybody
agree
to
that,
you
would
still
say
that
you're
entitled
to
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
this
mean
that
if
you
would've
prevailed
on
the
question
of
power
which
has
to
provide
for
consideration
of
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
a
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
we
don't
have
some
of
that
year
assuming
that
you
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this,
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
amount
of
tax
actually
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
who
paid
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whose
check
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
check
did
the
government
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
wrote
the
check
to
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
total
tax
but
why
wouldn't
each
company
write
a
check
for
each
year
of
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
explain
this
to
me?
section
1552
permit
an
allocation
of
tax
liability
back
to
the
companies
in
anyone
of
several
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
just
say
for
purpose
of
1552.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
allows
the
allocation
back
to
the
companies
of
tax
liability
and
one
of
the
ways
in
which
it
could
allocated
is
to
allocate
back
to
this
regulated
company,
here
is
52%.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
wait
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
company's
did
they
allocated
back
to
united
the
regulated
company
52%.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
united
out
of
pocket
cost
for
taxes
regularly
and
consistently
is
52%
of
its
net
income
although
1552
would
permit
a
different
allocates.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
business
of
the
fpc
got
and
say
that
what
to
repeal
this
part
of
1552?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
answering
--
just
answer
against
his
background,
1552
--
1501
doesn't
require
consolidated
parent.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
these
companies
could've
returned
their
income
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
united
would've
paid
52%
of
its
net
income
and
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
recognized
and
a
tax
allowance
is
52%
even
though
a
consolidated
return
was
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
possibly
enough,
let's
get
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
get
back
straight.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
--
what
you
would
say
the
commission
in
a
--
would
have
power
to
require
either
the
filing
of
consolidated
return
or
a
result
equivalent
to
a
consolidated?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
a
consolidated
return
is
filed,
the
commission
has
the
power
to
select
the
method
of
allocating
tax
liability
even
though
it
restricts
the
choices
open
under
1552?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
producing
companies
the
one
that
in
this
case
that
is
responsible
for
the
losses?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
source
of
loss
in
the
producing
company,
this
what
--
there
were
declaration
expenses
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
account
separately
for
the
--
in
making
rates
for
the
regulated
business
and
the
unregulated?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
isn't
there
--
is
there
another
answer
to
that
claim?
let's
assume
it's
true,
absolutely
true
that
the
union
could
have
absorbed
all
of
these
losses
and
put
his
income
to
do
it,
there
is
no
question
that
the
--
is
that
critical
in
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
that
some
of
the
losses
have
been
charged
against
the
regulator.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
the
consolidated
return
to
reduce
the
taxes
of
the
regulated
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
some
of
the
losses
are
charged
to
get
it
against
of
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
rate
on
this
--
on
the
government's
basis
the
rates
have
to
change
every
year
when
the
business
fortunes
of
related
companies
keep
changing,
sometimes
they
have
income,
sometimes
they
don't
if
all
the
entities
in
this
consolidated
group
had
income,
i
suppose
the
regulated
company
would
have
some
tax
to
pay
perhaps
52%of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
a
single
entity,
suppose
one
corporation
has
the
regulated
department
in
a
non-regulated
department
then
the
unregulated
department
has
the
losses
and
the
corporation
pays
no
tax
because
of
those
losses.
i
suppose
you
apply
the
same
rule
to
that,
don't
you?
or
do
you
have
any
such
experience?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would,
it
would
sound
like
in
a
fortiori
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
an
unregulated
business
ever
have
a
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
an
unregulated
--
does
a
regulated
business
ever
have
a
loss
at
the
end
of
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
gather
it's
just
academic
to
ask
you,
what
you
do
about
this
problem
that
if
the
regulated
company
has
a
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
if
a
regulated
company
did
have
a
loss
over
every
year
for
five
years
you
would
still
allow
that
tax
--
in
setting
rates
you'd
still
allow
the
tax
benefit
even
though
they
paid
no
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
the
--
how
does
the
regulated
company
then
ever
get
its
rate
up
to
what
they
ought
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
regulated
company
is
losing
money
because
of
insufficient
income,
i
would
suppose
its
rates
are
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
in
this
case.
this
is
different
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think
intangible
drilling
costs
aren't
real
losses?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
certainly
cost
a
lot
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
volume
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
and
it
would
go
on
allowing
it
even
though
the
company
continued
to
have
losses
because
somebody
has
made
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
think
let's
assume
they
haven't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yes,
and
they
would
--
but
they
would
continue
to
allow
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
give
them
a
tax.
now,
the
only
point
being
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
the
tax
factor
its
calculated
in
the
rate
although
the
tax
has
been
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
position
is
in
this
case
that
the
five-year-period
is
a
forecast?
justice
byron
r.
white
really,
it
has
to
forecast
as
to
what
tax
liability
actually
will
be
in
the
future.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
goldberg,
how
does
on
the
regulated
companies
actual,
let's
say
it's
a
profit
and
loss
statement
at
the
end
of
the
year.
say
a
certified
accountant
was
certified
to
what
its
income
--
that
income
was
at
the
end
of
the
year.
what
figure
would
it
show
as
for
taxes
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
an
operating
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
an
allocation
but
the
--
in
terms
of
this
one
company
how
much
cash
tax
actually
goes
out?
it's
only
it's
out
of
the
share
of
the
taxes
that
actually
goes
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
operating
statement
would
just
show
that
the
actual
tax
expense
or
the
tax
charge
begins
income
with
only
be
the
actual
cash
outgo
for
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
would
only
--
so,
it
wouldn't
be
52%
it
would
be
50%.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
talking
about
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
take
a
(inaudible)
assume
that
without
the
consolidated
statement
incorporate
that
the
regulated
company
would
have
paid
$50,000.00
to
federal
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
treasury.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
consolidated
statement
if
share
of
net
of
income
taxes
is
$25,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
its
own
accounting
would
show
just
the
actual
cash
outlay
for
taxes
and
it
thus
increases
its
net
income,
i
mean
this
consolidated
return
increases
its
own
net
income
available
for
dividend
as
compared
with
non-consolidated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that's
$50,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
supposing
the
actual
facts
in
this
case
then
where
there
is
a
consolidated
return
not
a
separate
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
would
its
accounting,
its
certified
public
accountant
say
its
tax
cost
was
for
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
fletcher,
excuse
me
please.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
the
commission
has
incorrectly
determined
the
actual
tax
cost
to
the
regulated
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
this
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
incorrectly
determined
what
the
actual
out
of
pocket
tax
cost
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
now,
is
united
gas
line
is
that
the
regulated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
the
one
whose
rate
is
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
--
do
you
say
that
united
actually
had
a
cash
out
way
of
52%
for
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
argument,
i'm
just
wondering
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
the
losses
which
--
was
a
matter
of
fact
in
filing
on
a
consolidated
basis
saved
the
regulated
company
any
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
now,
let's
carry
it
on
a
little
more
--
if
united,
the
regulated
company
had
filed
separately
it
would've
paid
52%
and
you
say
it
wrote
a
check
for
that
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
government
or
to
the
parent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
doesn't
the
parent
pay
the
consolidated
tax
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
mechanically
they
allocated
that
from
consolidated
return
purpose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
took
the
total
income
and
offset
it
by
the
losses
of
the
group
and
the
net
result
has
the
federal
tax
rate
replied
to
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
amount
is
then
allocated
back
to
the
company,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
federal
tax
laws
the
regulated
company
in
the,
assume
the
out
share
of
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
brackett,
the
point
you
--
section
1552
says
that
pursuant
to
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
the
earnings
and
profits
of
each
member
of
an
affiliated
group
required
to
be
included
in
the
consolidated
return
shall
be
allocated
and
in
accordance
with
one
of
four
different
methods
available.
now,
anyone
could
read
those
sections
then
it
requires
that
you
chose
the
--
not
that
you
want
to
allocate
the
tax
liability
and
if
you
don't
choose
why
it's
by
1552
(a)
(1)
i
gather.
now,
how
in
this
case
or
was
the
choice
made
of
allocating
the
tax
liability
under
section
1552?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
it
must
--
that
is
not
one
of
the
way
that
it's
expressly
listed
but
so
it
must
have
been
under
four,
the
tax
liability
of
the
group
shall
be
allocated
in
the
court
of
any
other
methods
selected
by
the
group.
in
any
event,
the
actual
check
to
be
wrote
print
to
the
united
states
was
52%.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
concede
for
the
moment
that
an
allocation
could
have
been
made
consistent
with
section
1552
which
would
have
reduced
the
actual
tax
cost
to
united
below
52%?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
so
that
the
1552
would've
permitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
wouldn't
make
--
you
would
make
the
same
argument
no
matter
what
the
method
of
allocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
that
is
it
permissible
for
us
to
think
about
this
case
in
terms
of
a
single
company
that
has
both
regulated
and
unregulated
business
and
they
were
unregulated
business
having
losses
and
the
regulated
business
having
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
decent
model
with
this
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
fpc
regulated
portion
is
that
you
say
that
the
unregulated
portion
is
an
exploration,
the
exploration
operation
and
there
are
intangible
drilling
costs
and
its
producing
operation
and
there
is
consequently
depletion.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
the
company
predictably
would
pay
no
tax
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
saying
that
if
it's
all
one
entity
and
predictably
there
are
going
to
be
sufficient
intangible
drilling
costs
over
a
period
of
the
years
to
reduce
the
tax
of
this
single
entity
to
zero
every
year
predictably
and
everybody
agreed,
they'll
pay
no
tax
for
the
next
10
years.
you
would
say
on
your
argument
nevertheless
and
nevertheless
that
the
rate
structure
of
the
company
should
be
set
to
reflect
a
tax
cost
of
52%
of
the
regulated
companies
or
regulated
divisions
earning.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
i
think
i'm
clear
enough
now
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
just
to
make
it
clear,
if
on
a
consolidated
return
there
was
no
consolidated
that
income
and
hence
no
tax
to
be
allocated
or
paid
by
anybody
and
predictably
that
would
be
true
for
future.
you
would
say
that
nevertheless
the
regulated
company
should
be
allowed
52%
tax
credit
for
making
it
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
can
understand
you
could
make
an
issue
on
whether
or
not
the
fpc
correctly
concluded
that
the
--
that
there
would
or
wouldn't
be
losses
or
would
or
wouldn't
be
income
but
that's
the
factual
determination
i
suppose
but
let's
just
assume
the
you
could
predict
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
consolidated
net
income
for
the
next
10
years
and
everybody
admits
to
assume
everybody
agree
to
that,
you
would
still
say
that
you're
entitled
to
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
this
mean
that
if
you
would've
prevailed
on
the
question
of
power
which
has
to
provide
for
consideration
of
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
a
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
we
don't
have
some
of
that
year
assuming
that
you
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this,
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
amount
of
tax
actually
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
who
paid
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whose
check
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
check
did
the
government
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
wrote
the
check
to
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
total
tax
but
why
wouldn't
each
company
write
a
check
for
each
year
of
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
explain
this
to
me?
section
1552
permit
an
allocation
of
tax
liability
back
to
the
companies
in
anyone
of
several
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
just
say
for
purpose
of
1552.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
allows
the
allocation
back
to
the
companies
of
tax
liability
and
one
of
the
ways
in
which
it
could
allocated
is
to
allocate
back
to
this
regulated
company,
here
is
52%.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
wait
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
company's
did
they
allocated
back
to
united
the
regulated
company
52%.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
united
out
of
pocket
cost
for
taxes
regularly
and
consistently
is
52%
of
its
net
income
although
1552
would
permit
a
different
allocates.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
business
of
the
fpc
got
and
say
that
what
to
repeal
this
part
of
1552?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
answering
--
just
answer
against
his
background,
1552
--
1501
doesn't
require
consolidated
parent.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
these
companies
could've
returned
their
income
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
united
would've
paid
52%
of
its
net
income
and
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
recognized
and
a
tax
allowance
is
52%
even
though
a
consolidated
return
was
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
possibly
enough,
let's
get
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
get
back
straight.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
--
what
you
would
say
the
commission
in
a
--
would
have
power
to
require
either
the
filing
of
consolidated
return
or
a
result
equivalent
to
a
consolidated?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
a
consolidated
return
is
filed,
the
commission
has
the
power
to
select
the
method
of
allocating
tax
liability
even
though
it
restricts
the
choices
open
under
1552?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
your
position.
