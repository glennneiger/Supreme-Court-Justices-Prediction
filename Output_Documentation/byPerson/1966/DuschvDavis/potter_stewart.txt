(inaudible)
the
mayor
or

executive
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
the
mayor
or
other
executive
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
council
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
a
city
manager
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
pleasure
of
the
council.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
--
he
runs
as
the
chief
administrative
officer,
the
day-to-day
executive
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
operations
of
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
former
plan
first
authorized
five
from
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
present
one
authorizes
four?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
old
plan,
i
suppose
this
isn't
important
but
i
--
the
old
plan
like
the
present
one,
did
it
provide
that
all
of
the
people
wherever
they
live
were
to
be
elected
by
all
of
the
voters
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
basic
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
would
be
though
the
equivalent
if
you're
going
to
pursue
that
analogy,
you
would
have
to
assume
that
the
state
legislature
was
wanting
to
elect
it
at
large.
and
take
for
example
illinois,
the
analogy
would
be
a
seven-member
legislature,
eleven-member
legislature
in
illinois,
as
one
from
chicago,
five
from
the
other
--
five
or
six
from
the
other
living
in
the
other
places,
and
for
at
large
and
all
elected
by
the
electorate
of
the
state
at
large
that
would
be
the
system,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
how
far
it's
appropriate
to
pursue
this
in
practical
inquiry
about
this
"once
from
pungo,
always
from
pungo"
argument.
there
would
be
presumably
more
than
one
candidate
from
pungo.
and
if
the
election
is
by
the
city
at
large,
i
should
think
that
the
man
who
is
the
least
provincial
--
pungo
man
would
get
a
larger
vote
from
the
city
at
large,
would
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
only
600
and
some
total
vote
in
pungo
in
the
--
these
people
are
running
to
get
the
majority
of
the
--
a
majority
of
the
vote
of
the
entire
city.
and
i
should
think
that
the
rule
--
the
pungo
man
to
be
a
very
--
to
be
the
--
as
little
at
least
provincial
as
possible
in
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
a
very
valid
argument
if
there
were
only
one
candidate
from
pungo,
but
there
were
--
there
would
be
two
or
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
that
premise?
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
mayor
or

justice

who
was

of
the
council
