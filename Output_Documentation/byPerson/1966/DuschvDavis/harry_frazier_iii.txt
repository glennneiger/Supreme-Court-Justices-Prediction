mr.
harry
frazier
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
involving
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
virginia
wherein
the
appellants
are
the
members
of
the
city
council.
the
appellees
are
voters
within
the
city.
this
case
presents
three
questions,
two
of
which
we
think
can
be
disposed
of
promptly
so
that
we
may
concentrate
primarily
on
the
third
one.
the
first
question,
and
this
was
put
to
us
by
the
court,
was
whether
a
three-judge
court
should
have
been
convened
below
to
hear
this
case
in
the
first
instance.
the
plan
of
representation
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
today
applies
only
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
virginia.
it
was
adopted
by
a
special
act
of
the
legislature.
there
is
none
like
it
in
the
city.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
we
are
properly
before
the
court
because
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
a
city
charter
of
this
nature
does
not
present
the
matter
of
statewide
interest,
the
state
statute
for
the
purpose
of
a
three-judge
jurisdiction.
we
understand
that
the
appellees
do
not
contest
position.
and
while
we
understand
of
course
that
jurisdiction
of
this
court
cannot
be
conferred
by
consent,
we
feel
the
matter
is
now
so
clear
that
jurisdiction
is
proper,
that
unless
the
court
wishes
me
to
pursue
it,
we
think
we
can
accomplish
more
by
moving
on.
the
second
question
presented
on
this
appeal
is
whether
one
man,
one
vote
applies
below
the
level
of
state
legislatures.
we
believe
the
court
should
not
extend
this
principle
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
brief.
the
question
has
been
fully
argued
in
the
three
proceeding
cases.
we
have
nothing
new
to
add
to
that
argument.
in
the
brief
time
available,
we
wished
to
cover
new
arguments,
matters
that
are
peculiar
to
this
case
and
are
not
involved
in
the
other
case.
our
principal
argument
therefore
is
that,
while
we
do
not
believe
the
seventh
--
the
one
man,
one
vote
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
local
government
even
if
it
is
extended
to
local
government,
the
seven-four
plan
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach
is
a
valid
plan
of
representation.
this
brings
us
to
the
third
and
vital
question
in
our
case.
we
say
at
the
outset,
seven-four
plan
does
accord
with
the
reynolds
case
and
the
mandate
of
one
man,
one
vote.
now
what
is
the
seven-four
plan?
the
solicitor
general
indicated
to
you
quite
properly
that
this
is
a
plan
of
at
large
election
of
seven
councilmen
for
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
four
are
elected
without
residential
requirement.
they
may
reside
anywhere
in
the
city.
the
seven
others
are
elected
with
a
residential
requirement,
one
being
required
to
reside
in
each
of
seven
boroughs
of
the
city.
the
seven
boroughs
are
of
disproportionate
population
ranging
from
--
according
to
the
1960
census,
700
and
some
persons
in
the
smallest
to
approximately
29,000
persons
in
the
largest.
now,
we
say
the
plan
affords
every
voter
in
the
city
an
opportunity
to
vote
for
11
councilman,
all
of
the
council.
the
residential
requirement
does
not
destroy
the
fact
that
each
councilman
is
the
cityâ€™s
councilman
and
not
a
councilman
merely
of
the
borough
in
which
he
resides.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
it
is
set
up
on
the
ballot
by
having
the
borough
election
for
a
resident
councilman
from
blackwater.
and
the
person
who
has
declared
or
persons
who
have
declared
from
blackwater
appear
with
a
box
opposite
their
name
and
you
vote
for
one.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
and
the
same
for
each
of
the
seven
boroughs
that
large
seats
without
residential
requirement,
you
vote
for
four
out
of
the
number
that
appear.
but
the
important
point
in
this
plan
is
that
the
residential
feature
does
not
destroy
the
crucial
fact
that
these
people
represent
all
of
the
city.
and
we
feel
that
the
court
had
recognized
this
already.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
purpose
of
the
residential
requirement
is
to
guarantee
that
the
view
points
of
all
sections
of
an
amazingly
complex
city
are
going
to
be
presented
to
its
governing
body.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
don't
think
it
can
be
stated
quite
that
way
mr.
justice
white.
it's
on
the
assumption
that
they
will
be
familiar
with
the
problems
of
the
area
in
which
they
reside.
they
still
represent
the
city
as
a
whole.
and
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
for
this
court
in
fortson
against
dorsey,
the
fact
that
he
resides
in
any
given
portion
of
the
election
district
does
not
make
him
any
--
the
less
the
representative
of
the
entire
district,
whether
it'll
be
a
city
as
in
this
case
or
a
county
or
a
state
senatorial
district
as
in
that
case.
the
court
recognizes
the
crucial
fact
that
the
residential
requirement
does
not
destroy
his
citywide
standing.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
and
the
test
is
that
you
first
determine
what
the
geographical
unit
is
that
you're
talking
about,
virginia
beach
city,
and
then
to
determine
whether
your
treating
everybody
within
the
city
of
virginia
beach
the
same
way.
now
this
is
the
--
if
you
will,
the
extreme
statement
of
our
view.
we
believe
it
to
be
true.
and
we
believe
that
this
alone
would
justify
the
seven-four
plan
if
the
court
extends
the
principle
to
local
governments.
yet
there
is
another,
and
in
our
view,
equally
as
rational
reason
for
sustaining
the
plan
although
it
does
require
considerably
more
discussion
and
elaboration.
that
is
that
the
plan
of
seven-four
representation
can
be
justified
rationally
for
this
city
of
virginia
beach
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
that
exist
here.
and
this
requires
me
to
come
now
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
i
only
hope
that
i
have
not
kept
them
from
you
too
long.
in
the
first
place,
i
want
to
answer
for
the
case
here
a
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
had
raised
in
the
other
cases.
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
the
court
may
provide
a
standard
or
a
rule
based
on
the
degree
of
legislative
power,
the
extent
of
power
that
the
governing
body
in
question
had.
that
question
--
that
solution
is
of
no
significance
here
because
the
council
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach
exercises
all
local
power.
there
is
no
overlapping
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
town,
there
is
no
county,
any
power
exercised
at
the
local
level
is
exercised
by
this
city
council.
so
we
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand
the
different
posture
of
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
mayor
is
the
president
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
of
the
city
council.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
a
city
manager
who
is
appointed
to
serve
at
the
pleasure
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
of
the
city
council.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
now,
what
about
the
city
of
virginia
beach?
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
now
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that's
been
in
mind
your
honor.
we
have
neither
county
nor
town
involved
here,
all
we
have
is
city.
there
are
no
towns
within
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
there
are
no
counties
within
it,
or
of
which
the
city
is
a
part.
the
city
of
virginia
beach
is
a
completely
independent
political
subdivision
deriving
all
of
its
powers
directly
from
the
constitution
and
statutes
to
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
so
this
is
why
we
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
are
quite
different
in
our
system
of
local
government.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
there
are
seven
boroughs,
the
boundaries
of
which
are
historical
more
than
anything
else.
now
that
brings
us
to
how
this
city
of
virginia
beach
got
to
be
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
but
first,
let's
see
where
it
is
and
what
it
is.
this
is
a
city
of
some
300
square
miles.
it
has
--
in
the
1960
census
about
85,000
people.
the
1964
estimated
population
is
about
118,000
people
and
less
than
a
year
ago,
an
estimated
population
of
135,000
people.
it
lies
directly
south
of
the
city
of
norfolk.
it
is
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
atlantic
ocean,
on
the
side
by
the
state
of
north
carolina,
on
the
west
by
an
adjoining
city.
it
is
a
large
city,
300
square
miles.
it
is
made
up
of
the
bedroom
communities
adjacent
to
the
city
of
norfolk
where
you
have
dense
suburban
type
development.
people
who
are
living
and
working
in
the
city
of
norfolk
and
in
adjoining
military
installations,
and
on
the
southern,
and
in
particular,
you
have
very
sparsely
settled
agricultural
land,
you
have
game
preserves,
some
of
the
best
duck
hunting
in
the
city
--
in
the
state
of
virginia,
is
within
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
300
square
miles.
it
is
an
exceptionally
large
geographical
area
and
an
exceptionally
diverse
area.
the
half
of
the
city
is
devoted
to
rural
pursuits,
agriculture
being
the
principal
industry.
a
great
deal
of
the
rest
of
it
is
purely
suburban
type
developments,
rows
of
houses
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
15
by
20.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that's
correct.
with
large
water
areas
in
it,
it
is
a
truly
remarkable
and
unique
city.
now
this
city
is
a
result
of
a
consolidation
of
a
little
city,
former
city
of
virginia
beach,
which
was
nothing
but
a
seaside
resort
of
about
8000
people
and
princess
anne
county
which
included
the
same
amalgamation,
conglomeration
of
development.
the
residential
suburbs
of
the
norfolk
area
and
the
farming
land,
a
consolidation
of
a
small
city
and
a
large
county,
a
county
large
in
both
population
and
in
area.
this
consolidation
took
place
pursuant
to
a
plan
and
a
referendum
which
passed
in
both
the
city
and
the
county.
the
initial
plan
was
to
consolidate
the
governing
bodies
of
a
former
city
and
a
former
county
into
one.
that
was
a
five-man
city
council
from
the
former
city
of
virginia
beach,
they
were
elected
at
large,
and
the
six-man
board
of
supervisors
from
former
princess
anne
county
elected
on
a
district
basis
and
the
districts
were
disproportionate
in
population.
the
--
this
you
see
is
the
essence
of
the
seven
boroughs
we
have
now.
they
are
the
same
as
the
magisterial
districts
in
the
former
county
plus
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach.
the
consolidation
took
place
according
to
state
law.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
observed
yesterday,
one
of
the
problems
when
you
consolidate
people
is
to
guarantee
to
minority
groups.
some
say
about
what
their
government
is.
so
the
initial
system
preserved
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach
within
8000
people,
five
men
on
an
eleven-man
council.
but
this
has
been
changed
because
in
the
challenge
of
the
system,
the
district
court
held
the
system
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
although
the
order
--
owning
it
unconstitutional
was
not
a
final
appealable
order
and
the
matter
was
deferred
until
the
next
general
assembly
of
virginia
because
the
city
council
had
already
before
its
plan
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
agreed
to
change
it.
the
plan
was
changed.
the
seven-four
plan
evolved
and
the
new
plan
was
then
challenged
bringing
us
into
the
present
phase
of
this
proceeding.
now
what
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
on
the
ground
that
one
man,
one
vote
applies
at
local
levels
of
government.
and
that
the
plan
--
or
the
former
plan
clearly
did
not
comply
with
that
mandate.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
in
1965.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
right.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no
sir.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
present
one
authorizes
one
from
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach,
elected
at
large.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
one
from
each
of
the
six
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
former
magisterial
districts
elected
at
large
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
and
four
elected
without
any
residential
requirements
at
all.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
they
could
come
from
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
now
we
come
to
this
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no
sir
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
it
was
a
strict
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
borough
award
system.
that
was
the
basic
difference,
yes
sir.
now,
why
was
the
seven-four
plan
selected
rather
that
some
other
plan?
the
reason
is
that
the
seven-four
plan
was
felt
to
be
the
fairest
for
the
city
as
a
whole.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
in
1966.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
city
first
considered
few
at
large
elections.
what
would
happen?
probably
they
would
be
elected
from
up
next
to
norfolk
where
the
majority
of
the
people
reside.
any
--
who
were
not
elected
there
were
elected
because
of
the
wish
of
the
majority
that
they
not
dominate
the
whole
show.
but
they
had
a
numerical
power
to
elect
all
of
them
from
the
heavily
populated
areas.
this
is
the
basic
fallacy
in
any
at
large
system.
it
eliminates
or
it
provide
that
a
--
that
rights
and
views
of
the
minority
will
be
totally
eliminated.
and
this
is
why
it
was
not
rejected
here.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
believe
three
of
them
were.
i'm
not
positive.
it
was
an
unusual
election
because
there
were
--
there
was
only
one
contested
seat
--
one
contested
of
the
eleven
seats
that
had
five
people
ran
before
at
large.
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
only
contest
was
in
one
of
the
borough,
one
of
the
borough
seats,
so
the
four
--
before
the
rather
large
without
residential
requirement
your
honor
posed.
now,
the
second
amount
of
that
was
considered
was
--
ward
elections
of
boroughs
of
substantially
equal
population?
how
would
that
work
in
a
city
like
virginia
beach
which
is
growing
as
fast
as
this
city
is
which
grew
40%
in
four
years.
two
of
its
boroughs
have
grew
60%
in
four
years.
how
do
you
apportion
a
city
that's
undergoing
demographic
changes
of
this
magnitude?
you
would
be
out
of
date
before
you
got
started.
and
it
was
considered
to
be
an
impractical
plan.
as
well
as
the
fact
that
in
order
to
get
a
borough
with
the
minimum
number
of
population,
you'd
have
one
borough
representing
half
of
the
geographical
area
of
the
city
to
begin
with.
so
this
plan
was
considered
not
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
now
the
seven-four
plan
was
designed
to
take
the
best
elements
of
both
of
these
systems
and
to
get
rid
of
the
objections
of
appellants.
the
need
was
to
look
out
for
the
smaller
areas,
the
agricultural
interest
of
this
diverse
city
while
giving
everyone
a
free
expression
in
the
selection
of
these
representatives.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
because
in
your
state
governments
you
are
already
looking
at
--
for
the
--
the
geography
does
that.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
because
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
as
i
see
the
districting
for
state
legislatures,
however
you
do
it,
you're
going
to
have
one
district
that
has
--
that
gives
an
opportunity
to
represent
agricultural
interest
because
thatâ€™s
where
they
are.
now
when
you
get
into
a
city,
you
wouldn't
have
at
large
election
of
a
state
legislature,
i
donâ€™t
know
any
that
does
and
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that's
correct.
now
the
important
point
here
is
we
don't
have
do
decide
whether
as
an
abstract
principle.
this
is
proper
or
improper.
our
point
is
that
it
makes
sense,
it
can
be
justified
on
a
rational
basis
for
the
city
of
virginia
beach
which
does
not
mean
that
it
could
be
justified
in
the
state
of
illinois,
in
the
city
of
richmond
or
the
city
of
pasadena.
for
these
problems
of
this
city,
it
provides
an
effective
method
of
taking
care
of
the
needs
of
the
whole.
now,
the
majority
always
controls.
three
of
these
boroughs
are
fairly
heavily
populated
or
densely
populated,
four
--
three
are
sparsely
populated
and
one
is
sort
of
in
the
middle.
under
any
plan,
the
majority
can
always
control
the
council
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
this
is
no
case
such
as
was
suggested
in
alabama
where
there
was
a
rural
stranglehold.
it
cannot
happen
here,
so
that
this
is
an
important
element
in
our
plan,
a
rational
justification
of
this
city.
there
is
no
evasive
scheme
to
avoid
reapportionment
because
they
had
done
their
reapportionment.
there
is
no
attempt
to
perpetuate
people
in
office
because
any
man
can
be
thrown
out
of
office
by
the
will
of
the
majority.
there
is
no
possible
way
that
discrimination
against
any
racial
groups
(inaudible)
involved
here
and
this
has
been
a
problem
in
some
reapportionment
cases.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no,
i
do
not,
nor
do
i
know
of
any
city
that
cries
for
the
protection
this
city
affords.
virginia
beach
is,
in
our
view,
unique
and
it
requires
a
different
type
of
treatment
than
other
city
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
however,
even
if
the
court
will
not
go
along
with
us
on
that
ground,
the
court
can
and
should
sustain
this
plan
on
the
rationality,
the
eminent
fairness
of
the
plan
as
it
relates
to
the
city
which
it
is
designed
to
serve.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
you
have
brought
me
to
my
final
aspect
of
this
argument.
and
that
is
this,
i
think
the
court
should
recognize
that
greater
flexibility
should
be
allowed
local
government
in
dealing
with
local
problems.
that
is
necessary
in
providing
to
the
needs
of
state
legislatures.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
erred
by
saying
that
reynolds
prohibited
the
consideration
of
anything
else
than
population.
we
think
this
is
fundamentally
wrong
if
you're
going
to
have
effective
local
government.
the
solicitor
general
started
of
on
that
attack,
but
backed
down
on
the
questioning
from
the
court
and
indicated
that
well,
may
be
there
is
a
reason
or
room
to
vary
system.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
of
course,
that's
the
basic
hurdle
you've
got
to
get
over
if
youâ€™re
going
to
decide
one
man,
one
vote
does
apply
down
here
in
local
government.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
this
is
true.
what
may
be
satisfactory
in
one
case
may
be
totally
unsatisfactory
on
other.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
i
don't
think
it
requires
this
court
to
do
it.
i
think
it
can
say
that
if
local
government
requires
one
man,
one
vote
principles,
then
we
have
got
to
look
at
each
system
separately.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that
because
the
record
shows
that
the
guarantee
to
the
former
city
of
virginia
beach
with
its
8000
people
of
a
degree
of
identity
and
representation
in
substance
on
the
city
council
was
an
essential
element
and
without
that,
they
never
would
have
voted
for
this
plan
and
no
question
about
that.
it
was
the
other
fellows,
the
county
boys
who
had
the
most
to
gain
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
one,
not
the
only
but
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
consolidation
to
begin
with
was
the
city
of
norfolk
was
threatening
to
dip
down
into
princess
anne
county
and
take
substantial
areas
in
virginia,
an
extension
as
in
--
as
unlike
most
other
states,
is
purely
a
judicial
process
in
which
the
people
have
no
referendum
rights
or
any
other
rights
to
veto
the
plan.
they
can
come
in
and
scream
about
it
but
it's
a
judicial
determination
so
that
mr.
justice
white,
you're
entirely
correct
in
pointing
out
an
essential
element
of
the
original
plan.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
i
think
there
are
two
aspects
of
that
question.
first
of
all,
the
virginia
city
is
primarily
an
urban
area
to
find
vast
areas
of
farmland
as
is
true
in
virginia
beach
or
the
broad
or
the
large
number
of
square
miles
as
is
true
in
virginia
beach
is
not
the
usual
situation
that
prevails
in
virginia
cities.
the
city
government
--
the
city
area
is
usually
your
densely
built-up
areas
and
you
step
over
an
imaginary
line
and
youâ€™re
in
a
county
and
sometimes
you
donâ€™t
know
the
difference.
there
are
a
couple
of
exemptions
in
virginia,
there
are
two
other
cities
of
which
i
am
aware
that
also
have
substantial
rural
areas
where
they
do
follow
at
large
elections.
yet
in
those
cities,
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
is
not
as
great
as
it
is
here
and
those
citizens
elected
--
chose
to
have
at
large
elections.
here,
the
feeling
was
that
the
best
interest
of
this
city
required
the
guarantee
of
a
voice
from
the
rural
areas
of
the
city.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
two
things
that
characterize
this
city
are
its
explosive
growth
and
the
heterogeneous
makeup
which
is
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
i
agree
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
exercises
powers
of
a
city.
it
is
more
like
a
state
in
that
it
has
a
widely,
varying
conditions
within
it,
yes,
but
its
government,
its
function,
its
duties
are
those
of
the
city.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
alright.
i
see
that
my
allotted
time
has
expired
and
i
wish
to
save
some
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
request
otherwise.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
two
things
should
be
said
in
reply
to
mr.
howell.
first,
he
artfully
suggests
that
this
plan
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
virginia.
he
doesn't
say
it.
he
conveys
that
impression
an
unmistakable
effect.
has
not
so
--
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
had
determined
that
the
policy
of
the
state
which
does
favor
boroughs
of
equal
population
--
wards
of
equal
population
does
not
require
it
in
the
city
of
virginia
beach
which
has
especially
conferred
charter
by
the
general
assembly.
so
let's
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
despite
these
references,
to
what
the
policy
of
the
state
is,
the
plan
that
we
have
here
is
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
contrary
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
that
is
applicable.
now
the
second
thing
that
i
feel
we
must
point
out
in
reply
to
mr.
howell.
he
is
strangely
silent
about
minorities.
and
i
know
mr.
howell
better
than
you
gentlemen.
one
of
mr.
howell's
greatest
concerns
back
home
is
minorities,
but
he's
strangely
silent
when
we
come
to
minorities
in
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
we're
talking
not
about
a
racial
minority,
were
talking
about
economic
minority
groups
here,
agriculture,
the
largest
industry
in
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
agricultural
lands
occupy
over
more
than
half
of
the
area.
but
he
would
provide
no
means
of
any
effective
representation
for
them.
he
doesn't
even
face
up
to
the
problem.
in
this
we
feel
is
ignoring
a
responsibility
of
local
government
that
it
must
make
it
possible
for
minority
views
to
be
expressed.
there
are
two
cases
that
deal
on
this
that
are
mentioned
in
our
brief.
one
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general
involving
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
borough
--
five
boroughs
each
have
two
elected
at
large
within
the
borough
but
not
more
than
one
can
be
from
any
political
party.
it's
an
effort
ignoring
one
man,
one
vote
for
the
purpose
of
ten
of
the
37
councilman.
it
is
a
conscious
effort
to
provide
representation
to
minority
groups.
and
you
an
have
more
than
one
from
a
political
party.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
and
they
cannot
run
the
city.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
quite
agree.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
they
cannot
run
this
city.
because
the
people
who
are
elected
from
the
smaller
boroughs
will
constitute
at
most
three
or
four
out
of
eleven
members
so
they
can't
run
anything.
and
this
is
why
we
think
this
is
the
only
plan
that
we've
been
able
to
come
up
with
that
guarantees
an
expression
of
the
view
points
from
minority
interest
and
yet
ensures
that
the
majority
will
always
have
the
opportunity
to
control.
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
on
the
deliberations
of
the
city
council
to
those
who
were
residents
of
the
smaller
boroughs.
but
they
do
have
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes,
it
would.
but
well
--
we
are
saying
is
you
can
extend
equal
protection
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
but
there
are
reasons,
two
particular
reasons
why
you
should
affirm
or
validate
the
seven-four
plan.
it's
opportunity
for
all
to
participate
in
the
election
of
all
councilmen
and
the
unusual
circumstances,
the
rational
justification
for
the
plan
viewed
in
the
light
of
these
circumstances.
this
is
thrust
of
our
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
involving
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
virginia
wherein
the
appellants
are
the
members
of
the
city
council.
the
appellees
are
voters
within
the
city.
this
case
presents
three
questions,
two
of
which
we
think
can
be
disposed
of
promptly
so
that
we
may
concentrate
primarily
on
the
third
one.
the
first
question,
and
this
was
put
to
us
by
the
court,
was
whether
a
three-judge
court
should
have
been
convened
below
to
hear
this
case
in
the
first
instance.
the
plan
of
representation
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
today
applies
only
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
virginia.
it
was
adopted
by
a
special
act
of
the
legislature.
there
is
none
like
it
in
the
city.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
we
are
properly
before
the
court
because
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
a
city
charter
of
this
nature
does
not
present
the
matter
of
statewide
interest,
the
state
statute
for
the
purpose
of
a
three-judge
jurisdiction.
we
understand
that
the
appellees
do
not
contest
position.
and
while
we
understand
of
course
that
jurisdiction
of
this
court
cannot
be
conferred
by
consent,
we
feel
the
matter
is
now
so
clear
that
jurisdiction
is
proper,
that
unless
the
court
wishes
me
to
pursue
it,
we
think
we
can
accomplish
more
by
moving
on.
the
second
question
presented
on
this
appeal
is
whether
one
man,
one
vote
applies
below
the
level
of
state
legislatures.
we
believe
the
court
should
not
extend
this
principle
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
brief.
the
question
has
been
fully
argued
in
the
three
proceeding
cases.
we
have
nothing
new
to
add
to
that
argument.
in
the
brief
time
available,
we
wished
to
cover
new
arguments,
matters
that
are
peculiar
to
this
case
and
are
not
involved
in
the
other
case.
our
principal
argument
therefore
is
that,
while
we
do
not
believe
the
seventh
--
the
one
man,
one
vote
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
local
government
even
if
it
is
extended
to
local
government,
the
seven-four
plan
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach
is
a
valid
plan
of
representation.
this
brings
us
to
the
third
and
vital
question
in
our
case.
we
say
at
the
outset,
seven-four
plan
does
accord
with
the
reynolds
case
and
the
mandate
of
one
man,
one
vote.
now
what
is
the
seven-four
plan?
the
solicitor
general
indicated
to
you
quite
properly
that
this
is
a
plan
of
at
large
election
of
seven
councilmen
for
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
four
are
elected
without
residential
requirement.
they
may
reside
anywhere
in
the
city.
the
seven
others
are
elected
with
a
residential
requirement,
one
being
required
to
reside
in
each
of
seven
boroughs
of
the
city.
the
seven
boroughs
are
of
disproportionate
population
ranging
from
--
according
to
the
1960
census,
700
and
some
persons
in
the
smallest
to
approximately
29,000
persons
in
the
largest.
now,
we
say
the
plan
affords
every
voter
in
the
city
an
opportunity
to
vote
for
11
councilman,
all
of
the
council.
the
residential
requirement
does
not
destroy
the
fact
that
each
councilman
is
the
cityâ€™s
councilman
and
not
a
councilman
merely
of
the
borough
in
which
he
resides.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
it
is
set
up
on
the
ballot
by
having
the
borough
election
for
a
resident
councilman
from
blackwater.
and
the
person
who
has
declared
or
persons
who
have
declared
from
blackwater
appear
with
a
box
opposite
their
name
and
you
vote
for
one.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
and
the
same
for
each
of
the
seven
boroughs
that
large
seats
without
residential
requirement,
you
vote
for
four
out
of
the
number
that
appear.
but
the
important
point
in
this
plan
is
that
the
residential
feature
does
not
destroy
the
crucial
fact
that
these
people
represent
all
of
the
city.
and
we
feel
that
the
court
had
recognized
this
already.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
purpose
of
the
residential
requirement
is
to
guarantee
that
the
view
points
of
all
sections
of
an
amazingly
complex
city
are
going
to
be
presented
to
its
governing
body.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
don't
think
it
can
be
stated
quite
that
way
mr.
justice
white.
it's
on
the
assumption
that
they
will
be
familiar
with
the
problems
of
the
area
in
which
they
reside.
they
still
represent
the
city
as
a
whole.
and
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
for
this
court
in
fortson
against
dorsey,
the
fact
that
he
resides
in
any
given
portion
of
the
election
district
does
not
make
him
any
--
the
less
the
representative
of
the
entire
district,
whether
it'll
be
a
city
as
in
this
case
or
a
county
or
a
state
senatorial
district
as
in
that
case.
the
court
recognizes
the
crucial
fact
that
the
residential
requirement
does
not
destroy
his
citywide
standing.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
and
the
test
is
that
you
first
determine
what
the
geographical
unit
is
that
you're
talking
about,
virginia
beach
city,
and
then
to
determine
whether
your
treating
everybody
within
the
city
of
virginia
beach
the
same
way.
now
this
is
the
--
if
you
will,
the
extreme
statement
of
our
view.
we
believe
it
to
be
true.
and
we
believe
that
this
alone
would
justify
the
seven-four
plan
if
the
court
extends
the
principle
to
local
governments.
yet
there
is
another,
and
in
our
view,
equally
as
rational
reason
for
sustaining
the
plan
although
it
does
require
considerably
more
discussion
and
elaboration.
that
is
that
the
plan
of
seven-four
representation
can
be
justified
rationally
for
this
city
of
virginia
beach
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
that
exist
here.
and
this
requires
me
to
come
now
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
i
only
hope
that
i
have
not
kept
them
from
you
too
long.
in
the
first
place,
i
want
to
answer
for
the
case
here
a
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
had
raised
in
the
other
cases.
there
has
been
some
suggestion
that
the
court
may
provide
a
standard
or
a
rule
based
on
the
degree
of
legislative
power,
the
extent
of
power
that
the
governing
body
in
question
had.
that
question
--
that
solution
is
of
no
significance
here
because
the
council
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach
exercises
all
local
power.
there
is
no
overlapping
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
town,
there
is
no
county,
any
power
exercised
at
the
local
level
is
exercised
by
this
city
council.
so
we
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand
the
different
posture
of
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
mayor
is
the
president
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
of
the
city
council.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
a
city
manager
who
is
appointed
to
serve
at
the
pleasure
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
of
the
city
council.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
now,
what
about
the
city
of
virginia
beach?
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
now
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that's
been
in
mind
your
honor.
we
have
neither
county
nor
town
involved
here,
all
we
have
is
city.
there
are
no
towns
within
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
there
are
no
counties
within
it,
or
of
which
the
city
is
a
part.
the
city
of
virginia
beach
is
a
completely
independent
political
subdivision
deriving
all
of
its
powers
directly
from
the
constitution
and
statutes
to
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
so
this
is
why
we
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
are
quite
different
in
our
system
of
local
government.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
there
are
seven
boroughs,
the
boundaries
of
which
are
historical
more
than
anything
else.
now
that
brings
us
to
how
this
city
of
virginia
beach
got
to
be
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
but
first,
let's
see
where
it
is
and
what
it
is.
this
is
a
city
of
some
300
square
miles.
it
has
--
in
the
1960
census
about
85,000
people.
the
1964
estimated
population
is
about
118,000
people
and
less
than
a
year
ago,
an
estimated
population
of
135,000
people.
it
lies
directly
south
of
the
city
of
norfolk.
it
is
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
atlantic
ocean,
on
the
side
by
the
state
of
north
carolina,
on
the
west
by
an
adjoining
city.
it
is
a
large
city,
300
square
miles.
it
is
made
up
of
the
bedroom
communities
adjacent
to
the
city
of
norfolk
where
you
have
dense
suburban
type
development.
people
who
are
living
and
working
in
the
city
of
norfolk
and
in
adjoining
military
installations,
and
on
the
southern,
and
in
particular,
you
have
very
sparsely
settled
agricultural
land,
you
have
game
preserves,
some
of
the
best
duck
hunting
in
the
city
--
in
the
state
of
virginia,
is
within
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
300
square
miles.
it
is
an
exceptionally
large
geographical
area
and
an
exceptionally
diverse
area.
the
half
of
the
city
is
devoted
to
rural
pursuits,
agriculture
being
the
principal
industry.
a
great
deal
of
the
rest
of
it
is
purely
suburban
type
developments,
rows
of
houses
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
15
by
20.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that's
correct.
with
large
water
areas
in
it,
it
is
a
truly
remarkable
and
unique
city.
now
this
city
is
a
result
of
a
consolidation
of
a
little
city,
former
city
of
virginia
beach,
which
was
nothing
but
a
seaside
resort
of
about
8000
people
and
princess
anne
county
which
included
the
same
amalgamation,
conglomeration
of
development.
the
residential
suburbs
of
the
norfolk
area
and
the
farming
land,
a
consolidation
of
a
small
city
and
a
large
county,
a
county
large
in
both
population
and
in
area.
this
consolidation
took
place
pursuant
to
a
plan
and
a
referendum
which
passed
in
both
the
city
and
the
county.
the
initial
plan
was
to
consolidate
the
governing
bodies
of
a
former
city
and
a
former
county
into
one.
that
was
a
five-man
city
council
from
the
former
city
of
virginia
beach,
they
were
elected
at
large,
and
the
six-man
board
of
supervisors
from
former
princess
anne
county
elected
on
a
district
basis
and
the
districts
were
disproportionate
in
population.
the
--
this
you
see
is
the
essence
of
the
seven
boroughs
we
have
now.
they
are
the
same
as
the
magisterial
districts
in
the
former
county
plus
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach.
the
consolidation
took
place
according
to
state
law.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
observed
yesterday,
one
of
the
problems
when
you
consolidate
people
is
to
guarantee
to
minority
groups.
some
say
about
what
their
government
is.
so
the
initial
system
preserved
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach
within
8000
people,
five
men
on
an
eleven-man
council.
but
this
has
been
changed
because
in
the
challenge
of
the
system,
the
district
court
held
the
system
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
although
the
order
--
owning
it
unconstitutional
was
not
a
final
appealable
order
and
the
matter
was
deferred
until
the
next
general
assembly
of
virginia
because
the
city
council
had
already
before
its
plan
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
agreed
to
change
it.
the
plan
was
changed.
the
seven-four
plan
evolved
and
the
new
plan
was
then
challenged
bringing
us
into
the
present
phase
of
this
proceeding.
now
what
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
on
the
ground
that
one
man,
one
vote
applies
at
local
levels
of
government.
and
that
the
plan
--
or
the
former
plan
clearly
did
not
comply
with
that
mandate.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
in
1965.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
right.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no
sir.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
the
present
one
authorizes
one
from
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach,
elected
at
large.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
one
from
each
of
the
six
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
former
magisterial
districts
elected
at
large
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
and
four
elected
without
any
residential
requirements
at
all.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
they
could
come
from
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
the
old
city
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
now
we
come
to
this
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no
sir
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
it
was
a
strict
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
--
borough
award
system.
that
was
the
basic
difference,
yes
sir.
now,
why
was
the
seven-four
plan
selected
rather
that
some
other
plan?
the
reason
is
that
the
seven-four
plan
was
felt
to
be
the
fairest
for
the
city
as
a
whole.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
in
1966.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
city
first
considered
few
at
large
elections.
what
would
happen?
probably
they
would
be
elected
from
up
next
to
norfolk
where
the
majority
of
the
people
reside.
any
--
who
were
not
elected
there
were
elected
because
of
the
wish
of
the
majority
that
they
not
dominate
the
whole
show.
but
they
had
a
numerical
power
to
elect
all
of
them
from
the
heavily
populated
areas.
this
is
the
basic
fallacy
in
any
at
large
system.
it
eliminates
or
it
provide
that
a
--
that
rights
and
views
of
the
minority
will
be
totally
eliminated.
and
this
is
why
it
was
not
rejected
here.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
believe
three
of
them
were.
i'm
not
positive.
it
was
an
unusual
election
because
there
were
--
there
was
only
one
contested
seat
--
one
contested
of
the
eleven
seats
that
had
five
people
ran
before
at
large.
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
only
contest
was
in
one
of
the
borough,
one
of
the
borough
seats,
so
the
four
--
before
the
rather
large
without
residential
requirement
your
honor
posed.
now,
the
second
amount
of
that
was
considered
was
--
ward
elections
of
boroughs
of
substantially
equal
population?
how
would
that
work
in
a
city
like
virginia
beach
which
is
growing
as
fast
as
this
city
is
which
grew
40%
in
four
years.
two
of
its
boroughs
have
grew
60%
in
four
years.
how
do
you
apportion
a
city
that's
undergoing
demographic
changes
of
this
magnitude?
you
would
be
out
of
date
before
you
got
started.
and
it
was
considered
to
be
an
impractical
plan.
as
well
as
the
fact
that
in
order
to
get
a
borough
with
the
minimum
number
of
population,
you'd
have
one
borough
representing
half
of
the
geographical
area
of
the
city
to
begin
with.
so
this
plan
was
considered
not
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
now
the
seven-four
plan
was
designed
to
take
the
best
elements
of
both
of
these
systems
and
to
get
rid
of
the
objections
of
appellants.
the
need
was
to
look
out
for
the
smaller
areas,
the
agricultural
interest
of
this
diverse
city
while
giving
everyone
a
free
expression
in
the
selection
of
these
representatives.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
because
in
your
state
governments
you
are
already
looking
at
--
for
the
--
the
geography
does
that.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
because
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
as
i
see
the
districting
for
state
legislatures,
however
you
do
it,
you're
going
to
have
one
district
that
has
--
that
gives
an
opportunity
to
represent
agricultural
interest
because
thatâ€™s
where
they
are.
now
when
you
get
into
a
city,
you
wouldn't
have
at
large
election
of
a
state
legislature,
i
donâ€™t
know
any
that
does
and
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that's
correct.
now
the
important
point
here
is
we
don't
have
do
decide
whether
as
an
abstract
principle.
this
is
proper
or
improper.
our
point
is
that
it
makes
sense,
it
can
be
justified
on
a
rational
basis
for
the
city
of
virginia
beach
which
does
not
mean
that
it
could
be
justified
in
the
state
of
illinois,
in
the
city
of
richmond
or
the
city
of
pasadena.
for
these
problems
of
this
city,
it
provides
an
effective
method
of
taking
care
of
the
needs
of
the
whole.
now,
the
majority
always
controls.
three
of
these
boroughs
are
fairly
heavily
populated
or
densely
populated,
four
--
three
are
sparsely
populated
and
one
is
sort
of
in
the
middle.
under
any
plan,
the
majority
can
always
control
the
council
of
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
this
is
no
case
such
as
was
suggested
in
alabama
where
there
was
a
rural
stranglehold.
it
cannot
happen
here,
so
that
this
is
an
important
element
in
our
plan,
a
rational
justification
of
this
city.
there
is
no
evasive
scheme
to
avoid
reapportionment
because
they
had
done
their
reapportionment.
there
is
no
attempt
to
perpetuate
people
in
office
because
any
man
can
be
thrown
out
of
office
by
the
will
of
the
majority.
there
is
no
possible
way
that
discrimination
against
any
racial
groups
(inaudible)
involved
here
and
this
has
been
a
problem
in
some
reapportionment
cases.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no,
i
do
not,
nor
do
i
know
of
any
city
that
cries
for
the
protection
this
city
affords.
virginia
beach
is,
in
our
view,
unique
and
it
requires
a
different
type
of
treatment
than
other
city
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
that
is
correct.
however,
even
if
the
court
will
not
go
along
with
us
on
that
ground,
the
court
can
and
should
sustain
this
plan
on
the
rationality,
the
eminent
fairness
of
the
plan
as
it
relates
to
the
city
which
it
is
designed
to
serve.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well
--
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
you
have
brought
me
to
my
final
aspect
of
this
argument.
and
that
is
this,
i
think
the
court
should
recognize
that
greater
flexibility
should
be
allowed
local
government
in
dealing
with
local
problems.
that
is
necessary
in
providing
to
the
needs
of
state
legislatures.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
erred
by
saying
that
reynolds
prohibited
the
consideration
of
anything
else
than
population.
we
think
this
is
fundamentally
wrong
if
you're
going
to
have
effective
local
government.
the
solicitor
general
started
of
on
that
attack,
but
backed
down
on
the
questioning
from
the
court
and
indicated
that
well,
may
be
there
is
a
reason
or
room
to
vary
system.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
of
course,
that's
the
basic
hurdle
you've
got
to
get
over
if
youâ€™re
going
to
decide
one
man,
one
vote
does
apply
down
here
in
local
government.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
this
is
true.
what
may
be
satisfactory
in
one
case
may
be
totally
unsatisfactory
on
other.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
i
don't
think
it
requires
this
court
to
do
it.
i
think
it
can
say
that
if
local
government
requires
one
man,
one
vote
principles,
then
we
have
got
to
look
at
each
system
separately.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that
because
the
record
shows
that
the
guarantee
to
the
former
city
of
virginia
beach
with
its
8000
people
of
a
degree
of
identity
and
representation
in
substance
on
the
city
council
was
an
essential
element
and
without
that,
they
never
would
have
voted
for
this
plan
and
no
question
about
that.
it
was
the
other
fellows,
the
county
boys
who
had
the
most
to
gain
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
one,
not
the
only
but
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
consolidation
to
begin
with
was
the
city
of
norfolk
was
threatening
to
dip
down
into
princess
anne
county
and
take
substantial
areas
in
virginia,
an
extension
as
in
--
as
unlike
most
other
states,
is
purely
a
judicial
process
in
which
the
people
have
no
referendum
rights
or
any
other
rights
to
veto
the
plan.
they
can
come
in
and
scream
about
it
but
it's
a
judicial
determination
so
that
mr.
justice
white,
you're
entirely
correct
in
pointing
out
an
essential
element
of
the
original
plan.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
well,
i
think
there
are
two
aspects
of
that
question.
first
of
all,
the
virginia
city
is
primarily
an
urban
area
to
find
vast
areas
of
farmland
as
is
true
in
virginia
beach
or
the
broad
or
the
large
number
of
square
miles
as
is
true
in
virginia
beach
is
not
the
usual
situation
that
prevails
in
virginia
cities.
the
city
government
--
the
city
area
is
usually
your
densely
built-up
areas
and
you
step
over
an
imaginary
line
and
youâ€™re
in
a
county
and
sometimes
you
donâ€™t
know
the
difference.
there
are
a
couple
of
exemptions
in
virginia,
there
are
two
other
cities
of
which
i
am
aware
that
also
have
substantial
rural
areas
where
they
do
follow
at
large
elections.
yet
in
those
cities,
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
is
not
as
great
as
it
is
here
and
those
citizens
elected
--
chose
to
have
at
large
elections.
here,
the
feeling
was
that
the
best
interest
of
this
city
required
the
guarantee
of
a
voice
from
the
rural
areas
of
the
city.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
two
things
that
characterize
this
city
are
its
explosive
growth
and
the
heterogeneous
makeup
which
is
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
i
agree
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
exercises
powers
of
a
city.
it
is
more
like
a
state
in
that
it
has
a
widely,
varying
conditions
within
it,
yes,
but
its
government,
its
function,
its
duties
are
those
of
the
city.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
alright.
i
see
that
my
allotted
time
has
expired
and
i
wish
to
save
some
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
request
otherwise.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
two
things
should
be
said
in
reply
to
mr.
howell.
first,
he
artfully
suggests
that
this
plan
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
virginia.
he
doesn't
say
it.
he
conveys
that
impression
an
unmistakable
effect.
has
not
so
--
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
had
determined
that
the
policy
of
the
state
which
does
favor
boroughs
of
equal
population
--
wards
of
equal
population
does
not
require
it
in
the
city
of
virginia
beach
which
has
especially
conferred
charter
by
the
general
assembly.
so
let's
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
despite
these
references,
to
what
the
policy
of
the
state
is,
the
plan
that
we
have
here
is
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
contrary
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
that
is
applicable.
now
the
second
thing
that
i
feel
we
must
point
out
in
reply
to
mr.
howell.
he
is
strangely
silent
about
minorities.
and
i
know
mr.
howell
better
than
you
gentlemen.
one
of
mr.
howell's
greatest
concerns
back
home
is
minorities,
but
he's
strangely
silent
when
we
come
to
minorities
in
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
we're
talking
not
about
a
racial
minority,
were
talking
about
economic
minority
groups
here,
agriculture,
the
largest
industry
in
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
agricultural
lands
occupy
over
more
than
half
of
the
area.
but
he
would
provide
no
means
of
any
effective
representation
for
them.
he
doesn't
even
face
up
to
the
problem.
in
this
we
feel
is
ignoring
a
responsibility
of
local
government
that
it
must
make
it
possible
for
minority
views
to
be
expressed.
there
are
two
cases
that
deal
on
this
that
are
mentioned
in
our
brief.
one
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general
involving
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
borough
--
five
boroughs
each
have
two
elected
at
large
within
the
borough
but
not
more
than
one
can
be
from
any
political
party.
it's
an
effort
ignoring
one
man,
one
vote
for
the
purpose
of
ten
of
the
37
councilman.
it
is
a
conscious
effort
to
provide
representation
to
minority
groups.
and
you
an
have
more
than
one
from
a
political
party.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
and
they
cannot
run
the
city.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
i
quite
agree.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
they
cannot
run
this
city.
because
the
people
who
are
elected
from
the
smaller
boroughs
will
constitute
at
most
three
or
four
out
of
eleven
members
so
they
can't
run
anything.
and
this
is
why
we
think
this
is
the
only
plan
that
we've
been
able
to
come
up
with
that
guarantees
an
expression
of
the
view
points
from
minority
interest
and
yet
ensures
that
the
majority
will
always
have
the
opportunity
to
control.
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
on
the
deliberations
of
the
city
council
to
those
who
were
residents
of
the
smaller
boroughs.
but
they
do
have
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
harry
frazier
iii
yes,
it
would.
but
well
--
we
are
saying
is
you
can
extend
equal
protection
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach.
but
there
are
reasons,
two
particular
reasons
why
you
should
affirm
or
validate
the
seven-four
plan.
it's
opportunity
for
all
to
participate
in
the
election
of
all
councilmen
and
the
unusual
circumstances,
the
rational
justification
for
the
plan
viewed
in
the
light
of
these
circumstances.
this
is
thrust
of
our
argument.
thank
you.
