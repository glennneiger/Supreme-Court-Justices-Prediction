chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
stature
of
the
towns
that
are
incorporated
in
the
county,
have
they
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
function
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
you
subdivide
the
city
into
these
districts
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
size
did
you
say
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
ground
was
it
declared
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1965,
oh,
i
haven't
thought
you
went
back
a
little
farther.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
special
situation
the
virginia
beach
is
as
compared
to
other
cities
that
amalgamate
some
smaller
communities
and
some
rural
area
into
one
larger
city?
what
is
peculiar
about
virginia
city
that
should
cause
us
to
treat
this
different
from
any
fairly
large
city
that
comes
together
by
way
of
consolidation
of
a
lot
of
territory
and
communities.
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
mr.
howell,
your
point
is
that,
once
from
pungo,
always
from
pungo
and
the
fact
that
it's
a
citywide
election
doesn’t
help
the
other
residence
of
the
city
because
they
have
to
elect
a
man
from
pungo.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
you
say
you
had
completed
your
argument
or
did
you
--
if
you're
going
to
argue
in
the
morning,
we'll
adjourn
now.or
but
if
you
had
completed
your
argument,
we
might
finish
it
because
the
counsel
only
has
10
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
want
to
hurry
you
at
all
but
i
thought
you've
said
that
that
was
all
you
could
contribute
or
something
to
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
frazier,
you
may
conclude
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
the
principle
of
equal
protection
is
not
applied
and
we
followed
your
doctrine,
would
it
not
be
possible
there
are
other
circumstances
to
so
arrange
the
boroughs
of
the
county
so
minorities
would
have
absolutely
no
place
in
government
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
