mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
before
examining
the
parochial
defects
of
the
seven-four
plan
which
stand
condemned
by
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
i
know
that
this
case
will
be
that
platform
for
setting
the
guidelines
for
other
cities
across
the
united
states
of
america.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
natural
supplementation
of
the
sims
case
would
be
somewhat
phrased
as
follows.
whenever
a
citizen
is
given
a
statutorial
right
to
vote
for
any
candidate
or
on
any
issue,
the
equal
protection
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
equal
weight
and
influence
must
be
given
to
each
and
every
vote.
justice
fortas'
dissenting
opinion
in
fortune
against
morris,
i
say
becomes
decisive
and
majority
language
when
considered
in
a
case
where
the
state
has
decided
that
there
shall
be
an
election
in
which
citizens
have
the
right
to
vote.
justice
fortas
stated
a
vote
is
not
an
object
of
art.
it
is
the
sacred,
most
important
instrument
of
democracy
and
of
freedom.
in
simple
terms,
the
vote
is
meaningless.
it
no
longer
serves
the
purpose
of
the
democratic
society
unless
it
taken
in
the
aggregate
with
the
votes
of
other
citizens
results
in
affecting
the
will
of
those
citizens
provided
that
they
are
more
numerous
than
those
of
differing
views.
we
submit
that
what
this
court
has
previously
said
is
that,
the
vote
is
the
only
way
the
american
citizen
has
to
speak
politically
and
that
there
will
no
--
there
will
be
no
degrees
of
freedom
of
political
speech
by
diluting
or
debasing
the
full
expression
of
his
vote
whether
that's
scheme
be
sophisticated
or
whether
it
be
apparent
as
it
knows
on
one
space.
we're
getting
now
to
the
case
as
before
the
court.
it
started
out,
how
did
the
city
of
virginia
beach
come
about?
what
is
the
genesis
of
it?
it
came
about
because
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
virginia
one
city
cannot
annex
another
city.
and
princess
anne
county
was
seeking
immunization
from
the
oddly
urban
scroll
of
the
city
of
norfolk
and
in
order
to
buy
that
immunization
they
had
to
guarantee
to
the
supervisors
on
the
board
of
supervisors
of
princess
anne
county
which
was
elected
by
wards
or
districts,
and
had
to
guarantee
to
the
five
members
of
the
city
council
of
the
resort
city
of
virginia
beach
who
were
elected
at
large,
they
had
to
guarantee
them
their
seats.
and
that
is
what
has
spoiled
the
constitutionality
of
the
present
government
of
virginia
beach.
when
you
attempt
to
mix
the
hard
political
bargaining
that
may
come
in
a
merger
or
arrangement
with
the
guarantee
of
one
man,
one
vote,
it
will
no
longer
--
it
will
no
more
mix
and
--
and
oil
will
mix
with
water.
the
first
plan,
the
city
of
virginia
beach
admitted,
was
unconstitutional,
the
faster
resolutions
that
they
will
go
into
the
general
assembly
to
seek
a
representative
form
of
government.
so
judge
hoffman
who
had
condemned
that
plan,
he
being
the
dissenter
in
the
three-judge
federal
court
ruling
in
mann
against
davis,
it
came
up
and
it
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
judge
hoffman
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
next
general
assembly.
now
if
the
court
please,
when
you
go
to
the
general
assembly
--
may
i
take
any
state
legislature
that
the
committee
on
county
citizen
towns
operates
on
the
matter
of
local
privilege.
if
i
come
up
there
with
a
charter
arrangement
to
divide
the
city
of
norfolk
into
a
thousand
and
one
parts
or
the
city
of
virginia
beach
in
2000
parts,
if
that's
what
the
legislative
says,
that
the
city
council
wants,
that's
what
the
city
council
gets.
so
there
is
no
real
overall
legislative
analysis
or
a
particular
change
in
a
local
charter.
so
they
thought
they
would
see
if
they
could
pass
a
muster
with
the
seven-four
plan.
and
the
test
really
in
this
case,
one
of
the
test,
other
than
the
annunciation
of
a
broad
principle
with
respect
to
city
and
forms
of
government
is
going
to
test
the
language
of
chief
justice
warren
when
he
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
reynolds
against
sims,
when
it
was
stated
that
sophisticated
plan
and
substance
are
--
sophisticated
plan
would
fail
just
as
quickly
as
would
one
that
respect
patently
unconstitutional.
because
here,
this
merger
or
bargaining
that
took
place,
it
was
designed
not
to
change
a
single
geographical
limit
of
a
single
magisterial
district
in
the
old
princess
anne
county.
it
was
designed
to
make
sure
that
the
rule-oriented
supervisor
could
be
guaranteed
election
on
the
new
city
council.
what
did
the
seven-four
plan
do?
it
didn't
change
a
single
geographical
line.
although
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
virginia
require
that
when
a
city
shall
have
wards,
those
wards
shall
be
changed
from
time
to
time
either
every
ten
years
or
sooner.
so
that
in
each
ward
there
will
be
as
near
as
possible
the
same
number
of
people.
virginia
has
led
the
nation
in
the
app
--
in
their
early
application
of
one
man,
one
vote
to
congressional,
to
state,
and
to
local
reapportionment.
sometimes
the
elected
officials
have
blinked
at
the
very
clear
log
that
it
is
written
in
all
levels
of
government
in
the
state
of
virginia.
so
not
a
single
geographical
change
was
made
and
they
found
a
way
to
guarantee
that
the
election
of
the
people
from
the
sparsely
settled
borough
pungo
where
i
think
in
blackwater,
where
there
were
about
733
people
compared
to
bayside
where
there
were
28,000
people.
now
these
people
in
the
populous
areas
which
are
the
voters
that
constitute
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
the
appellees
before
this
case,
they
are
concerned
with
the
fact
that
schools
have
to
be
built
almost
overnight
that
as
these
apartment
houses
go
up
and
these
housing
projects
spread
out
from
the
urban
core
of
norfolk
into
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
these
problems
must
be
solved.
and
the
slow
pace
of
the
agrarian
society,
the
only
problem
that
is
really
so
complicated
down
there
is
the
very
natural
desire
of
the
man
who
was
in
pungo
and
back
there
in
that
great
duck
hunting
country,
he
doesn't
want
to
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
a
bursting
of
population
that's
going
to
create
the
stupendous
rise
in
the
cost
of
government
that's
involved
in
fire,
police,
and
school
protection
for
these
thousands
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
exactly,
and
that's
what
judge
bryan
said
in
not
quite
so
graphic
words.
he
said,
“once
for
pungo,
all
for
--
always
for
pungo”.
the
pungo
man
are
no
longer
go
duck
hunting
with
his
buddies
down
there.
if
he
went
on
that
city
council
and
raise
the
taxes
of
pungo,
then
i
could
think
a
fine
of
this
--
this
courtroom,
it's
just
--
he
wouldn't
be
welcomed
at
the
country
store
when
he
went
down
on
saturday
to
talk
about
the
week’s
activity.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
what
we
want
to
do
is
integrate
the
farmer
with
the
--
with
this
--
the
suburbanite.
we
say
that
they
should
change
the
lines
as
they
have
done
throughout
virginia,
changed
the
ward
of
the
borough
line
so
that
we
have
some
of
each
in
there.
and
certainly
the
problems
of
the
people
have
got
to
be
answered
and
what
the
most
pressing
problem
is,
it
has
got
to
establish
the
general
(inaudible)
of
that
particular
municipal
form
of
government.
otherwise
we're
going
to
compound
oddly
responsiveness
of
the
government
to
the
needs
of
people
which
this
court
cut
off
at
the
past
with
the
one
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
judge
bryan
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
the
--
circuit
judge
bryan
when
he
said
that
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
no,
would
his
naturally
dominating
provincial
interest
be
neutralized
by
his
defendants
upon
the
electorate
of
the
entire
city
for
his
office.
his
subsequent
defeat
because
of
a
show
of
parochialism
would
not
remove
the
inequality
and
representation
for
the
choice
of
a
successor
which
still
be
limited
to
the
same
district.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
pungo
has
not
been
characterized
by
outstanding
demonstration
of
political
competition.
i
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
a
contest
for
the
pungo
magisterial
supervisor.
see,
he's
always
elected
as
supervisor
down
in
pungo
and
i
don't
think
it's
considered
fair
play
to
run
against
your
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
but
a
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
in
all
seriousness
if
this
court
please,
we
had
a
graphic
demonstration
of
how
one
city
identical
with
this
unique
city
of
virginia
beach,
read
sims,
read
the
mandate
of
this
court,
and
have
gone
about
elections
at
large.
these
cases,
the
virginia
beach
case
was
tried
concurrently,
and
at
the
same
time
the
city
of
chesapeake.
the
city
of
chesapeake
is
made
up
of
norfolk
county
and
south
norfolk.
they
merge
to
stop
norfolk
for
annexing
them
at
or
about
the
same
time.
now,
mr.
frazier
brags
about
the
ducks.
in
the
city
of
chesapeake,
we
have
the
largest
swamp
in
the
united
states
of
america,
the
dismal
swamp
and
the
best
bear
hunting,
with
the
best
deer
hunting.
it's
down
in
the
city
of
chesapeake.
but
they
went
to
the
general
assembly
of
virginia.
and
they
put
up
a
plan
whereby
all
of
that
councilmen
ran
at
large
and
they
--
well
on
their
way
to
restore
inviolability
to
this
new
city
of
chesapeake.
it's
--
i
think
that
perhaps
in
just
a
word
or
two
in
--
i
could
probably
conclude
what
contribution
i
could
make
to
this
court.
we
have
taken
the
statutory
history
of
cities
and
one
man,
one
vote
from
the
last
general
constitutional
convention
in
virginia
that
was
held
in
1901
and
1902.
at
that
time,
it
was
described
what
the
role
of
cities
would
be
in
virginia
namely
that
they
are
arms
of
the
state
for
discharging
certain
state
functions
and
they
are
government
within
themselves
with
all
of
the
legislative
powers,
and
governing
powers
that
the
council
for
--
appellants
have
sought
--
conceded.
i
believe
hour
for
adjournment
has
arrived.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
alright
sir.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
i
--
in
the
absence
of
questions
from
the
court.
this
court's
been
sitting
here
for
two
days
hearing
this
question,
i
just
say
that
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
virginia
has
statutes
that
require
one
man,
one
vote
and
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
deviation
from
the
statutory
guarantees
of
one
man,
one
vote
to
all
levels
of
government
in
virginia,
and
i
respectfully
submit
they
will
not
be
condoned
by
this
court
if
we
follow
the
normal
extension
of
sims.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
before

parochial
defects
of
the
seven-four
plan
which
stand

i
know
that

we're

and
that
is
what
has
spoiled

was
unconstitutional,
the

so

now
if
the

please,
when
you
go

--
may
i
take
any
state
legislature
that
the

county
citizen

if
i
come
up
there
with

arrangement
to
divide
the

into
a
thousand

one
parts
or
the

parts,
if
that's
what
the
legislative

that

wants,
that's
what
the
city

gets.
so
there
is
no
real

so
they
thought
they
would

old
princess
anne
county.
it
was
designed
to
make
sure
that
the
rule-oriented
supervisor
could
be
guaranteed
election
on
the
new
city
council.
what
did
the
seven-four
plan
do?
it
didn't
change
a
single
geographical
line.
although
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
virginia
require
that
when
a
city
shall
have
wards,
those
wards
shall
be
changed
from
time
to
time
either
every
ten
years
or
sooner.
so
that
in
each
ward
there
will
be
as
near
as
possible
the
same
number
of
people.
virginia
has
led
the
nation
in
the
app
--
in
their
early
application
of
one
man,
one
vote
to
congressional,
to
state,
and
to
local
reapportionment.
sometimes
the
elected
officials
have
blinked
at
the
very
clear
log
that
it
is
written
in
all
levels
of
government
in
the
state
of
virginia.
so
not
a
single
geographical
change
was
made
and
they
found
a
way
to
guarantee
that
the
election
of
the
people
from
the
sparsely
settled
borough
pungo
where
i
think
in
blackwater,
where
there
were
about
733
people
compared
to
bayside
where
there
were
28,000
people.
now
these
people
in
the
populous
areas
which
are
the
voters
that
constitute
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
the
appellees
before
this
case,
they
are
concerned
with
the
fact
that
schools
have
to
be
built
almost
overnight
that
as
these
apartment
houses
go
up
and
these
housing
projects
spread
out
from
the
urban
core
of
norfolk
into
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
these
problems
must
be
solved.
and
the
slow
pace
of
the
agrarian
society,
the
only
problem
that
is
really
so
complicated
down
there
is
the
very
natural
desire
of
the
man
who
was
in
pungo
and
back
there
in
that
great
duck
hunting
country,
he
doesn't
want
to
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
a
bursting
of
population
that's
going
to
create
the
stupendous
rise
in
the
cost
of
government
that's
involved
in
fire,
police,
and
school
protection
for
these
thousands
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
exactly,
and
that's
what
judge
bryan
said
in
not
quite
so
graphic
words.
he
said,
“once
for
pungo,
all
for
--
always
for
pungo”.
the
pungo
man
are
no
longer
go
duck
hunting
with
his
buddies
down
there.
if
he
went
on
that
city
council
and
raise
the
taxes
of
pungo,
then
i
could
think
a
fine
of
this
--
this
courtroom,
it's
just
--
he
wouldn't
be
welcomed
at
the
country
store
when
he
went
down
on
saturday
to
talk
about
the
week’s
activity.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
what
we
want
to
do
is
integrate
the
farmer
with
the
--
with
this
--
the
suburbanite.
we
say
that
they
should
change
the
lines
as
they
have
done
throughout
virginia,
changed
the
ward
of
the
borough
line
so
that
we
have
some
of
each
in
there.
and
certainly
the
problems
of
the
people
have
got
to
be
answered
and
what
the
most
pressing
problem
is,
it
has
got
to
establish
the
general
(inaudible)
of
that
particular
municipal
form
of
government.
otherwise
we're
going
to
compound
oddly
responsiveness
of
the
government
to
the
needs
of
people
which
this
court
cut
off
at
the
past
with
the
one
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
judge
bryan
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
the
--
circuit
judge
bryan
when
he
said
that
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
no,
would
his
naturally
dominating
provincial
interest
be
neutralized
by
his
defendants
upon
the
electorate
of
the
entire
city
for
his
office.
his
subsequent
defeat
because
of
a
show
of
parochialism
would
not
remove
the
inequality
and
representation
for
the
choice
of
a
successor
which
still
be
limited
to
the
same
district.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
pungo
has
not
been
characterized
by
outstanding
demonstration
of
political
competition.
i
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
a
contest
for
the
pungo
magisterial
supervisor.
see,
he's
always
elected
as
supervisor
down
in
pungo
and
i
don't
think
it's
considered
fair
play
to
run
against
your
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
but
a
--
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
in
all
seriousness
if
this
court
please,
we
had
a
graphic
demonstration
of
how
one
city
identical
with
this
unique
city
of
virginia
beach,
read
sims,
read
the
mandate
of
this
court,
and
have
gone
about
elections
at
large.
these
cases,
the
virginia
beach
case
was
tried
concurrently,
and
at
the
same
time
the
city
of
chesapeake.
the
city
of
chesapeake
is
made
up
of
norfolk
county
and
south
norfolk.
they
merge
to
stop
norfolk
for
annexing
them
at
or
about
the
same
time.
now,
mr.
frazier
brags
about
the
ducks.
in
the
city
of
chesapeake,
we
have
the
largest
swamp
in
the
united
states
of
america,
the
dismal
swamp
and
the
best
bear
hunting,
with
the
best
deer
hunting.
it's
down
in
the
city
of
chesapeake.
but
they
went
to
the
general
assembly
of
virginia.
and
they
put
up
a
plan
whereby
all
of
that
councilmen
ran
at
large
and
they
--
well
on
their
way
to
restore
inviolability
to
this
new
city
of
chesapeake.
it's
--
i
think
that
perhaps
in
just
a
word
or
two
in
--
i
could
probably
conclude
what
contribution
i
could
make
to
this
court.
we
have
taken
the
statutory
history
of
cities
and
one
man,
one
vote
from
the
last
general
constitutional
convention
in
virginia
that
was
held
in
1901
and
1902.
at
that
time,
it
was
described
what
the
role
of
cities
would
be
in
virginia
namely
that
they
are
arms
of
the
state
for
discharging
certain
state
functions
and
they
are
government
within
themselves
with
all
of
the
legislative
powers,
and
governing
powers
that
the
council
for
--
appellants
have
sought
--
conceded.
i
believe
hour
for
adjournment
has
arrived.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
alright
sir.
mr.
henry
e.howell,
jr.
i
--
in
the
absence
of
questions
from
the
court.
this
court's
been
sitting
here
for
two
days
hearing
this
question,
i
just
say
that
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
virginia
has
statutes
that
require
one
man,
one
vote
and
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
deviation
from
the
statutory
guarantees
of
one
man,
one
vote
to
all
levels
of
government
in
virginia,
and
i
respectfully
submit
they
will
not
be
condoned
by
this
court
if
we
follow
the
normal
extension
of
sims.
