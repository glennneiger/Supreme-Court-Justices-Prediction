then,
why
wouldn't
that
same
argument
apply
to
the
state
governments,
in
the

governments?
justice

fortas
no,
it
doesn't.
justice

there
may
be
some
states
in
which
there
is
a
majority
of
the
people
are
concentrated
in
one
or
two
urban
areas
and
then
you've
got
lots
of
people
in
quite
different
types
of
enterprises,
different
sort
--
different
areas
in
the
state
far
different
in
their
essential
characteristics.
justice
abe
fortas
then
i
suppose
that
there
might
be
some
difficulty.
if
we
approve
this
plan,
there
might
be
some
difficulty
in
rejecting
the
state
plan
that
one
were
--
brought
up
here
in
which
the
state
said
that
members
of
the
upper
house
would
be
elected
at
large
provided
that
they
have
to
be
residents
of
the
various
districts.
justice
abe
fortas
because
that
would
present
an
analogy
to
your
problem.
and
now,
i
know
that
you
want
us
to
consider
the
virginia
beach,
but
our
problem
is
a
little
more
complex
than
that?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well
in
effect,
i
expect
that
what
we're
hearing
is
that
virginia
beach
is
more
like
a
--
or
virginia
city
or
whatever
it’s
called,
is
more
like
a
state
than
a
city
except
possibly
with
respect
to
the
powers
of
exercise
in
the
two
jurisdictions.
justice
abe
fortas
then,
i
think
we
are
in
accord
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
the
problem
is
that
it
cuts
the
other
way
too
doesn't
it,
that
is
to
say
unless
you
share
mr.
ryan's
view
about
the
virtues
of
city
officials,
i'm
just
teasing
now.
the
city
or
the
people
who
--
if
you
had
all
of
the
members
of
the
governing
council
elected
from
the
city,
they
might
be
less
than
--
less
solicitous
about
the

areas
and
the
rural
people
think
