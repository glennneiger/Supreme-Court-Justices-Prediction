how
was
that
set
up
on
the
ballot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
everyone
in
the
city
votes
for
one,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
still
responsible
in
other
words
for
the
citywide
election
and
not
just
to
a
borough
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
the
dimensions?
something
like
10
by
30
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
15
by
20,
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
was
that
adopted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

this
was
after
the

reversal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
frazier,
may
i
ask
in
that
--
anticipate
--
in
fact,
hasn't
there
been
an
election
of
the
seven-four
plan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
before
at
large,
has
it
worked
out
that
they've
been
elected
from
the
heavily
populated
areas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
basic
position
however
is
that
the
seven-four
plan,
acquiring
as
it
does
at
large
election
of
all
eleven
even
though
seven
come
from
(inaudible)
satisfies
the
one
man,
one
vote
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
--
this
is
--
are
you
suggesting
mr.
frazier
this
would
require
an
analysis
of
each
of
the
20,000
units
by
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
not
unless
you're
going
to
say.
i
suggest
that
that
there
are
elements
that
you
urge
in
this,
of
uniqueness
in
each
case
which
we
ought
to
consider?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
approach
certainly
would
require
us
to
look
at
each
in
the
20,000
units?
