mr.
rogovin
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
amounts
expended
for
meals
by
respondent,
a
marine
officer
serving
overseas
under
circumstances
where
his
family
could
not
accompany
him
constitute
a
deductible
trade
or
business
expense
under
section
162
(a)
(2)
of
the
code
which
in
pertinent
part
provides
up
the
“traveling
expenses”
including
the
entire
amount
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business
would
be
deductible
or
whether
such
expenditures
are
nondeductible
items
prohibited
by
section
262's
warrant
that
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
chapter
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
personal,
living
or
family
expenses.
in
1957,
the
marine
respondent,
a
career
marine
officer
was
stationed
at
el
toro,
california.
during
that
year,
he
had
received
permanent
duty
orders
to
the
fleet
marine
force
pacific
located
at
iwakuni,
japan.
a
captain
stidger
had
been
in
el
toro,
california
for
some
two
and
a
half
years
prior
to
the
receipt
of
his
change
of
duty
orders.
prior
to
that,
he
had
been
in
albuquerque
permanently
stationed
with
the
marine
corps.
while
living
at
el
toro,
he
lived
with
his
family
in
an
adjoining
town
of
santa
ana.
on
october
1st,
1957
when
his
squadron
was
transferred
to
iwakuni,
japan,
captain
stidger
began
a
15-month
tour
overseas.
during
this
period
of
time,
his
family
remained
in
santa
ana,
california
because
of
a
marine
order
that
precluded
dependence
from
joining
their
servicemen
husband
and
fathers
when
they
were
stationed
with
the
fleet
marine
force
pacific
which
was
the
organization
that
the
squadron
was
assigned
to,
so
that
during
this
period
of
time,
the
family
continued
to
live
at
santa
ana,
california.
in
december
of
1958,
the
respondent
had
completed
his
overseas
tour
and
was
assigned
to
the
marine
air
station
at
cherry
point,
north
carolina.
mr.
rogovin
no
sir.
he
is
--
mr.
rogovin
a
land
base.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
a
marine
air
base.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
this
is
a
word
of
art
--
mr.
rogovin
--
justice
fortas.
i
believe
there
were
permanent
duty
station
orders.
i
believe
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
rogovin
the
actual
orders
are
not
part
of
the
record.
and
the
distinction
i
draw
with
the
language
of
permanence
is
a
term
of
art
of
the
armed
forces
to
distinguish
those
transfers
which
are
of
temporary
duty
as
opposed
to
a
shift
from
one
duty
station
to
another
duty
station.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
during
the
period
of
15
months,
the
respondent
was
stationed
at
iwakuni.
he
incurred
certain
expenditures
which
are
the
issue
before
this
court.
it
amounted
to
some
$650
which
he
paid
to
the
officer's
mess
for
his
food.
while
stationed
at
iwakuni,
the
respondent
paid
for
his
own
meals.
he
was
however
furnished
three-quarters
like
all
commissioned
officers
serving
in
--
with
the
fleet
marine
force.
and
like
all
commissioned
officers
in
the
military,
he
had
to
pay
for
his
own
meals.
now,
during
this
period
of
service,
there
were
two
allowances
which
are
quite
pertinent
to
the
case.
the
respondent
received
a
family
quarters
allowance
and
he
continued
to
receive
to
this
family
quarters
allowance
while
he
was
overseas.
this
amounted
to
$102.50
a
month,
tax
free
and
was
intended
to
provide
housing
for
dependents.
he
also
received
a
subsistence
allowance
of
$42.50
a
month,
similarly
tax
free.
this
was
his
food
allowance.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
both
allowances
were
obtainable
under
any
circumstance
of
service,
whether
it
be
in
the
united
states
or
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
rogovin
the
dependent
--
the
quarters
allowance
depends
on
your
marital
status
and
your
rank.
it
--
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
that's
--
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
i
believe
it's
just
whether
they
are
married
or
--
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
generally,
he
does
not
but
he
can
under
certain
circumstances
--
mr.
rogovin
--
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
it's
the
same
for
all
officers.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
the
respondent
claimed
the
$650
that
was
paid
for
his
food
at
the
officers
mess
at
iwakuni
as
a
deduction
under
162
(a)
(2)
of
the
revenue
code.
on
examination,
the
commissioner
disallowed
this
amount
and
the
respondent
petitioned
the
tax
court
for
redetermination.
the
tax
court
upheld
the
commissioner
and
found
that
the
respondent
was
not
traveling
away
from
home
as
the
term
--
the
word
home
is
used
in
section
162
that
the
respondent's
home
for
the
purposes
of
the
travel
expense
deduction
was
at
his
place
of
employment
which
was
iwakuni,
japan
during
this
period
of
time.
and
further
that
the
respondent
stay
at
iwakuni
was
not
temporary
so
as
to
allow
qualification
under
an
exception
for
temporary
travel
recognized
by
the
revenue
service
and
by
the
tax
court.
the
court
of
appeals
with
one
judge
dissenting
reversed
and
held
that
the
respondent's
home
was
where
his
family
resided,
santa
ana,
california.
thus
while
iwakuni
was
where
he
was
employed,
where
he
was
working,
in
effect,
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
to
the
effect
that
the
term
home
is
to
be
used
in
its
common
and
usual
sense
of
definition,
and
that
home
would
be
where
his
family
resided
at
santa
ana.
now,
the
interplay
of
section
162
(a)
(2)
giving
this
limited
deduction
and
section
262
which
sets
out
the
general
prohibition
against
family
and
living
expenses
was
before
this
court
some
20
years
ago
in
the
flowers
case.
that
time,
this
court
granted
certiorari
because
of
a
conflict
between
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
circuit
as
to
the
meaning
and
the
definition
of
the
term
“home”.
just
as
now,
the
ninth
circuit
using
home
in
its
ordinary
and
usual
sense,
referring
to
residents,
so
20
years
ago,
the
fifth
circuit
had
used
that
same
definition
in
the
flowers
case.
and
in
flowers,
the
three
conditions
that
were
outlined
by
this
court
as
being
prerequisites
that
must
be
met
before
the
deduction
could
be
taken
were
that
the
expense
be
a
reasonable
and
necessary
traveling
expense
that
the
expense
be
incurred
while
away
from
home,
that
they
must
be
incurred
in
the
pursuit
of
business.
now
without
finding
it
necessary
to
resolve
the
conflict
as
to
the
definition
of
home,
this
court
found
that
the
expenses
from
traveling
from
jackson,
mississippi
to
mobile,
alabama
where
the
taxpayer
in
flowers
was
employed
were
not
incurred
in
a
pursuit
of
business.
as
to
what
triggers
the
deduction,
the
court
stated
that
a
travel
expense
deduction
could
arise
only
when
the
employer's
business
forced
the
taxpayer
to
travel
and
to
live
temporarily
at
some
place
other
than
mobile,
the
facts
of
the
flowers
case.
while
this
court
has
not
defined
the
term
“home”,
the
treasury
and
the
majority
of
the
appellate
courts
have
for
many
years
treated
home
to
mean
the
taxpayers'
principal
place
of
business
or
employment.
the
ninth
circuit
says
to
the
contrary,
that
home
in
this
statute
must
be
defined
in
its
ordinary
and
usual
sense.
i
submit
that
dictionary
definitions
will
give
no
extraordinary
insight
into
this
issue.
while
we
are
faced
with
defining
home
in
a
specific
context
of
a
revenue
statute,
affording
a
tax
deduction
against
earned
income.
and
in
the
development
of
the
meaning
for
the
word
“home”,
i
submit
that
it
cannot
be
done
in
isolation
but
rather
it
must
give
purpose
to
the
provision
of
162
(a)
(2)
without
ignoring
the
prohibition
that
personal
living
and
family
expenses
are
generally
not
to
be
deducted.
in
accommodation
of
these
two
competing
statutory
concepts
is
what
is
at
issue
today.
for
example,
my
residence
is
in
annandale,
virginia.
i
work
at
the
department
of
justice's
tenth
in
constitution
in
the
district.
now,
if
we
were
to
use
“home”
in
the
ordinary
and
usual
sentence,
i
would
be
encouraged
to
deduct
the
travel
expenses
coming
to
and
from
work
because
they're
incurred
while
away
from
home,
my
residence,
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
but
clearly,
this
is
a
commutation
expense
that
i
incur.
and
the
regulations
for
many
years
have
said
that
this
is
a
prohibited
deduction.
furthermore,
this
court
in
the
flowers
case
gave
these
same
regulations,
the
force
in
effect
of
law.
so
clearly
from
the
very
outset,
the
word
“home”
has
a
tax
meaning.
i
submit
that
is
in
the
statute,
it
is
a
descriptor.
a
place
from
which
when
you
travel
on
the
pursuit
of
your
trade
or
business,
certain
tax
benefits
would
flow.
now,
the
legislative
history
does
not
shed
much
light
on
the
definition
of
home.
but
we
do
have
a
45-year
consistent
internal
revenue
service
interpretation
of
the
word,
that
taxpayers
generally
are
entitled
to
travel
expense
deductions
only
when
they
are
away
from
their
regular
place
of
employment.
i
submit
that
this
definition
strikes
the
necessary
balance
between
these
two
sections.
and
it
--
when
the
taxpayer
is
away
from
his
regular
place
of
business,
this
triggers
the
applicability
of
section
162.
it
allows
the
traveling
expense
to
be
brought
about
by
the
business
exigencies
of
the
taxpayer
whether
they'd
be
in
the
pursuit
of
this
trade
or
that
of
his
employers.
and
it
also
rules
out
the
deductibility
of
the
personal
or
family
living
expenses
which
are
not
to
be
born
by
the
public
fisk
as
demonstrated
by
section
262.
the
treasury's
view
provides
an
administrable
rule
that
fits
into
this
fabric
of
the
law
and
it
has
been
consistently
interpreted
since
1921.
section
162
(a)
(2)
was
intended
to
ameliorate
financial
hardship
to
taxpayers
who
incur
un-reimbursed
additional
living
expenses
when
they're
traveling
away
from
their
regular
place
of
employment
in
pursuit
of
business,
in
pursuit
of
trade
or
business.
it's
administered
so
as
to
put
this
taxpayer
on
a
parity
with
the
man
who
stays
at
home.
and
it
strikes
this
balance
to
provide
this
limited
exception
to
a
rule
against
the
deductibility
of
living
expenses.
now,
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
allow
deductions
for
living
expenses
while
away
from
the
residence
on
business
with
this
caveat,
unless
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
the
taxpayer
to
move
to
a
place
--
to
his
place
of
employment.
this
i
submit
is
a
very
subjective
qualification
and
it
raises
a
number
of
questions,
was
it
reasonable
to
move?
well,
this
could
be
a
question
of
judgment
values.
was
the
housing
in
the
new
city
adequate?
was
the
climate
such
that
it
would
not
be
deleterious
to
the
family?
or
was
the
schooling
such
that
it
could
equate
with
the
school
system
from
whence
the
taxpayers
to
move?
none
of
these
judgment
values
are
pertinent
to
attacks
on
income
or
the
expenses
to
be
attributed
to
its
earning.
they're
extremely
personal
in
nature.
and
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
tend
to
reject
the
flowers
opinion
of
this
court,
where
the
court
said,
“business
trips
are
to
be
identified
in
relation
to
business
demands
and
the
travelers
business
headquarters,
the
exigencies
of
business
rather
than
the
personal
convenience
and
necessity
of
the
traveler
must
be
a
--
must
be
motivating
factor".
if
the
taxpayer
in
hypothetical
took
the
position
that
he
could
contract
away
his
--
bringing
his
family,
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
taxpayer
in
los
angeles
who
was
an
engineer.
and
he
agrees
in
contractual
dealings
with
a
--
in
alaska
construction
company
that
he'll
go
up
there
for
five
years.
and
furthermore,
they
want
as
a
condition
of
employment
that
he
leaves
his
family
in
los
angeles.
and
to
ensure
that
he
stays
for
five
years,
they
worked
out
an
escrow
arrangement
with
respect
to
his
salary,
to
keep
him
there
for
that
time.
well,
under
these
circumstances,
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
i
would
assume
would
say
that
it
was
not
reasonable
for
him
to
bring
his
family.
it
wasn't
reasonable
because
he
couldn't
do
it.
it
was
an
impossibility
by
way
of
contract.
therefore,
his
travel
at
--
which
was
in
the
pursuit
of
business,
would
under
those
circumstances
i
would
assume
be
deductible.
he
would
have
the
living
expenses
of
his
family
in
los
angeles
and
a
separate
set
of
living
expenses
while
on
alaska.
i
believe
that
this
is
his
personal
choice.
and
that's
the
way
that
my
hypothetical
taxpayer
wished
to
live.
and
that
it's
no
different
than
the
flowers
case.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
applicability
of
the
rule.
you
look
to
the
usual
place
of
employment.
and
that
you
cannot
take
into
consideration
that
the
host
of
judgment
values
of
a
personal
nature
which
may
make
a
man
bring
his
family
across
and
not
to
bring
his
family
to
his
place
of
employment.
mr.
rogovin
i
suggest
--
however,
in
1963,
the
treasury
requested
some
clarifying
legislation
which
that
was
not
enacted.
critical
to
the
ninth
circuit's
viewing
of
this
case
was
their
question
of
whether
the
temporary
verse
is
indefinite
exception
would
apply
to
this
case
and
they
were
quite
critical
of
such
an
exception.
they
considered
a
more
flexible
test
and
their
flex
--
more
flexible
test
would
be
if
the
taxpayer
changes
his
--
he
would
have
to
change
his
tax
home
if
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
known
to
him
that
he
may
be
employed
for
a
long
period
of
time
at
his
new
station.
well,
this
rule,
i
submit,
doesn't
square
with
the
effort
to
equate
home
with
residence.
the
ninth
circuit
uses
a
concept
of
a
tax
home
and
under
certain
circumstances
they
would
say
that
the
place
of
employment
actually
dictates
whether
travel
expense
deductions
could
be
claimed.
the
problem
however
of
the
temporary
travel
and
i
believe
we
must
acknowledge
that
15
months
is
not
a
period
of
time
in
which
you
would
consider
extremely
permanent
at
that
date.
but
we
contend
that
the
question
of
the
length
of
time
that
the
respondent
was
away
is
not
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
this
case.
neither
the
length
of
time
nor
his
intent
become
relevant
because
when
he
left
santa
ana,
california,
he
cut
all
of
his
business
ties
with
that
base.
and
he
was
now
stationed
at
iwakuni,
japan.
he
had
no
business
purpose
to
be
away
from
santa
ana.
he
was
moved
by
the
marine
corp
for
a
15-month
period
to
iwakuni.
and
therefore,
there
is
complete
cleavage
just
as
there
was
a
cleavage
when
he
moved
from
albuquerque
to
santa
ana
and
from
santa
ana
to
iwakuni.
there
was
the
same
cleavage
when
he
left
japan
and
was
transferred
to
cherry
point,
north
carolina.
and
in
each
one
of
these
moves
dictated
by
his
employer,
he
terminated
his
business
contacts
with
the
community
in
which
he
was
living.
the
military
officer's
usual
place
of
work
is
his
permanent
duty
station.
there
is
a
place
where
he
is
assigned
by
the
military
and
it's
inherent
in
military
life.
the
professional
soldier's
life
is
regimented
to
a
degree
unparalleled
in
civilian
life.
we
certainly
recognized
the
many
military
posts
that
are
throughout
this
world.
and
the
frequency
of
transfer
from
one
post
to
another
is
a
constant
factor
in
military
life.
the
permanent
duty
station
is
not
only
clearly
the
place
of
employment
of
the
military
officer,
but
such
a
station
has
many
of
the
attributes
of
a
resident
community
as
well.
under
those
circumstances
where
the
family
or
dependents
are
allowed
to
travel
with
the
military
man,
base
housing
or
quarters
are
provided.
many
of
these
stations
or
camps
or
bases
have
developed
into
self-contained
communities
where
there
are
schools
and
churches
and
commissaries,
pxs,
dispensaries,
clubs
and
post
theaters.
and
these
attributes,
plus
the
system
of
tax
free
allowances
makes
the
frequency
of
change
of
duty
stations
less
burdensome.
so
it
is
to
give
military
officers
who
have
a
permanent
duty
station,
a
deduction
under
section
162
(a)
(2)
for
traveling
expenses
when
they
are
away
from
where
their
family
resides
would
be
--
i
submit
it
an
unwarranted
tax
windfall.
and
that
conflicts
with
the
purposes
of
section
162
(a)
(2)
and
section
262
which
in
combination
forbid
the
deduction
of
a
normal
living
expense.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
rogovin
it's
by
--
mr.
rogovin
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
there
are
a
number
of
circumstances
--
categories.
and
here
we
have
--
with
respect
to
people
finding
this
deduction
the
vast
bulk
of
the
public
involved
in
this
travel
away
from
home
deduction
are
people
who
lived
in
the
same
community
they
worked
in.
now,
we're
dealing
with
a
--
mr.
rogovin
--
a
separate
group,
not
of
the
military.
but
it
need
not
be
just
in
military.
you
can
envision
the
man
working
for
a
hotel
chain
and
they
moved
him
from
city
to
city
to
manage
their
hotels.
under
these
circumstances
i
believe
that
it's
quite
persuasive
to
view
the
employer's
intent
especially
when
you
have
a
career
employee
involved.
and
if
the
employer
believes
that
it's
for
the
business
--
the
best
interest
of
the
business
to
move
a
particular
employee
from
city
a
to
city
b,
from
station
a
to
station
b,
and
this
is
a
permanent
move
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
i
think
this
is
a
very
persuasive
factor
to
consider.
mr.
rogovin
it's
our
understanding
from
discussions
with
the
military
that
movements
--change
of
duty
that
the
ex
--
where
the
period
of
time
will
exceed,
i
think
five
or
six
months
will
be
considered
to
be
a
permanent
move
on
the
part
of
the
military.
and
certain
advantages
flow
from
orders
that
are
cut
in
that
nature.
when
a
man
is
moved
from
one
military
base
to
another
on
a
permanent
move,
he
receives
dislocation
allowances,
he
receives
per
diem
in
travel,
he
receives
an
expense
for
his
family
as
well,
and
his
dependents
as
well
as
his
own
travel.
on
the
other
hand,
when
a
man
is
given
temporary
duty
from
one
base
where
he
works
and
is
sent
somewhere
else
for
a
period
of
time,
he
receives
per
diem
but
he
cannot
move
his
family.
in
this
case,
captain
stidger
on
five
occasions
was
on
temporary
duty
from
iwakuni.
he
went
out
and
was
gone
a
period
of
time
17
and
20
minute
--
20
days
and
would
return.
and
as
to
these
movements,
we
would
consider
that
this
type
of
travel
is
the
type
covered
by
section
162
(a)
(2).
mr.
rogovin
the
service
had
a
ruling
out,
chief
justice,
dealing
with
naval
officers.
and
it
was
general
in
its
factual
pattern
that
a
naval
officer
who
is
aboard
ship
would
be
put
in
the
position
of
being
away
from
home
because
his
home
port
was
considered
his
usual
place
of
employment.
in
further
pursuing
and
discussing
this
with
the
service,
the
basic
premise
there
was
that
that
naval
officer
was
comparable
to
the
trainmen
or
the
airplane
pilot
or
the
truck
drivers
who
would
have
a
terminal
point
allowed
for
relatively
short
period
of
time
and
return.
under
those
circumstances,
the
ruling
would
prevail.
the
service
is
now
reconsidering
whether
there
is
a
broad
or
factual
pattern
covered
by
service
aboard
ship
than
the
premise
upon
which
they
based
the
ruling.
mr.
rogovin
to
the
extent
that
a
naval
officer
is
assigned
a
ship
and
the
--
i
think
quickly
of
a
relatively
small
ship
on
the
west
coast
that
may
go
out
for
a
couple
of
days,
maybe
out
for
a
couple
of
weeks.
but
the
home
port
is
the
usual
place
of
employment
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
he
is
on
travel
status.
and
when
he
is
afloat,
when
a
ship
is
out
to
sea,
then
he
would
be
in
a
travel
position.
this
is
like
the
commercial
fisherman
who
was
out
for
three
or
four
weeks
at
a
time
but
returns
to
his
home
port
that
being
his
usual
place
for
employment.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
it
could
be
--
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
it
could
be
so
interpreted
and
the
service
has
indicated
that
it
is
going
to
reexamine
--
mr.
rogovin
--
that
matter
situation.
mr.
rogovin
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
it
would
be
construed
as
consistent
as
to
those
cases
where
a
man
is
gone
for
two
years
at
sea
duty.
mr.
rogovin
that's
--
mr.
rogovin
i
-
i
could
not
say.
i
don't
believe
that
two
years
isn't
a
normal
thing
to
--
mr.
rogovin
--
for
a
period
of
time.
mr.
rogovin
i
don't
believe
justice
warren
that
the
man
would
be
at
sea
for
15
consecutive
months.
i
believe
it
would
--
as
i
understand
it'd
be
perhaps
no
more
than
six
or
eight
months,
and
then
they
would
come
back
to
port.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
they
would
be
able
to
deduct
them.
mr.
rogovin
oh,
i
believe
it
was
made
initially
in
some
years
back
because
the
consideration
was
that
--
the
ships
were
gone
for
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
and
did
not
consider
the
potential
of
an
atomic
submarine
that
could
remain
out
in
the
pacific
for
a
great
length
of
time,
over
a
year
perhaps.
and
this
is
what
is
being
reconsidered.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
they
are
able
to
deduct
their
meals.
mr.
rogovin
because
the
premise
of
the
naval
officer's
deduction
is
that
his
home
port
is
his
usual
place
of
employment.
this
premise
i
believe
is
questionable
on
the
factual
matter
when
you
deal
with
an
officer
who
was
aboard
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
mr.
rogovin
that
ruling?
mr.
rogovin
in
1955,
that
feature
of
the
ruling
was
stated
but
it
goes
back
more
than
that.
it
goes
back
in
the
1920's
and
1930's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
rogovin
well,
this
--
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
that
--
mr.
rogovin
well,
there
is
--
justice
warren,
there
is
no
regulation
involved.
there
is
a
ruling,
of
1955
ruling
that
specifically
says
that
this
type
of
duty
would
not
be
construed
as
being
away
from
home.
but
this
is
merely
a
construction
--
further
addition
of
the
position
that
has
been
in
existence
since
1921.
mr.
rogovin
the
away
from
home
or
the
military
rulings?
mr.
rogovin
in
19
--
no
sir,
the
fourth
circuit
viewed
a
similar
situation
where
a
1941
officer
was
assigned
to
a
military
base
--
mr.
rogovin
1941,
and
upheld
the
government's
position.
mr.
rogovin
the
subsistence
allowance
approximately
$42
and
50
cents.
mr.
rogovin
it
is
by
--
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
the
government
and
the
revenue
service
has
maintained
that
such
subsistence
allowances
are
not
taxable.
having
taken
that
position,
do
not
believe
that
requiring
a
netting
of
the
deduction
claimed
against
that
which
he
has
received
tax
free
would
be
an
appropriate
administrative
act
to
take
because
it
would
be
making
a
distinction
between
those
officers
who
are
away
from
home,
away
from
their
residence
and
those
who
are
living
at
home.
mr.
rogovin
i
would
think
that
the
service
would
want
to
reexamine
its
position
with
respect
to
these
allowances.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
at
iwakuni.
mr.
rogovin
no,
he
was
given
these
quarters
free.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
rogovin
$65
a
month.
for
10
months,
that's
how
the
$650
figure
was
reached.
mr.
rogovin
which
is
not
an
issue
--
mr.
rogovin
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
rogovin
for
the
actual
days
in
travel?
mr.
rogovin
he
did
receive
a
per
diem.
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
i
believe
the
frequency
of
change
of
duty
station
is
a
normal
factor.
the
allowances
that
are
involved
are
normal
factors.
there
are
duty
stations
throughout
the
world
where
a
family
is
not
permitted.
i
would
think
that
many
stations
in
vietnam
would
be
of
that
nature.
certainly,
during
world
war
ii,
you
can
think
of
many
situations.
and
in
the
record,
the
marine
corps
order
which
prohibited
the
--
of
the
family
from
going
with
captain
stidger
indicated
the
four
reasons
that
they
would
not
do
so,
so
that
it's
possible
that
it
would
--
is
at
page
28
of
the
record.
they
would
take
into
consideration
the
adverse
effect
that
the
presence
of
the
dependents
might
have
on
a
unit's
mission,
operational
readiness,
or
combat
capability,
second,
the
existence
of
suitable
dependents
facilities
for
all
married
personnel,
third,
the
standards
of
living
and
the
general
desirability
of
the
area,
and
fourth,
the
political
climate
obtaining
in
the
country
is
considered.
so
that
these
were
considerations
as
to
whether
or
not
the
family
would
be
allowed
to
go
over
with
the
officer.
mr.
rogovin
there
had
been
decisions
on
the
question
of
whether
home
is
residence.
the
fifth
circuit
in
flowers,
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
number
of
instances,
and
possibly
the
sixth
circuit
to
be
interpreted
in
saying
home
should
be
read
as
the
residence
and
not
usual
place
of
employment.
all
the
other
circuits
say
for
the
first
which
i
don't
believe
this
commented
on
the
issue
have
all
maintained
what
the
government's
position
that
home
should
be
construed
as
usual
place
of
employment.
as
to
the
military
feature,
the
only
other
case
was
the
bercaw
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
the
government
was
upheld.
mr.
rogovin
soon
after
the
war,
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
thank
you.
mr.
rogovin
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
amounts
expended
for
meals
by
respondent,
a
marine
officer
serving
overseas
under
circumstances
where
his
family
could
not
accompany
him
constitute
a
deductible
trade
or
business
expense
under
section
162
(a)
(2)
of
the
code
which
in
pertinent
part
provides
up
the
“traveling
expenses”
including
the
entire
amount
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business
would
be
deductible
or
whether
such
expenditures
are
nondeductible
items
prohibited
by
section
262's
warrant
that
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
chapter
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
personal,
living
or
family
expenses.
in
1957,
the
marine
respondent,
a
career
marine
officer
was
stationed
at
el
toro,
california.
during
that
year,
he
had
received
permanent
duty
orders
to
the
fleet
marine
force
pacific
located
at
iwakuni,
japan.
a
captain
stidger
had
been
in
el
toro,
california
for
some
two
and
a
half
years
prior
to
the
receipt
of
his
change
of
duty
orders.
prior
to
that,
he
had
been
in
albuquerque
permanently
stationed
with
the
marine
corps.
while
living
at
el
toro,
he
lived
with
his
family
in
an
adjoining
town
of
santa
ana.
on
october
1st,
1957
when
his
squadron
was
transferred
to
iwakuni,
japan,
captain
stidger
began
a
15-month
tour
overseas.
during
this
period
of
time,
his
family
remained
in
santa
ana,
california
because
of
a
marine
order
that
precluded
dependence
from
joining
their
servicemen
husband
and
fathers
when
they
were
stationed
with
the
fleet
marine
force
pacific
which
was
the
organization
that
the
squadron
was
assigned
to,
so
that
during
this
period
of
time,
the
family
continued
to
live
at
santa
ana,
california.
in
december
of
1958,
the
respondent
had
completed
his
overseas
tour
and
was
assigned
to
the
marine
air
station
at
cherry
point,
north
carolina.
mr.
rogovin
no
sir.
he
is
--
mr.
rogovin
a
land
base.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
a
marine
air
base.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
this
is
a
word
of
art
--
mr.
rogovin
--
justice
fortas.
i
believe
there
were
permanent
duty
station
orders.
i
believe
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
rogovin
the
actual
orders
are
not
part
of
the
record.
and
the
distinction
i
draw
with
the
language
of
permanence
is
a
term
of
art
of
the
armed
forces
to
distinguish
those
transfers
which
are
of
temporary
duty
as
opposed
to
a
shift
from
one
duty
station
to
another
duty
station.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
during
the
period
of
15
months,
the
respondent
was
stationed
at
iwakuni.
he
incurred
certain
expenditures
which
are
the
issue
before
this
court.
it
amounted
to
some
$650
which
he
paid
to
the
officer's
mess
for
his
food.
while
stationed
at
iwakuni,
the
respondent
paid
for
his
own
meals.
he
was
however
furnished
three-quarters
like
all
commissioned
officers
serving
in
--
with
the
fleet
marine
force.
and
like
all
commissioned
officers
in
the
military,
he
had
to
pay
for
his
own
meals.
now,
during
this
period
of
service,
there
were
two
allowances
which
are
quite
pertinent
to
the
case.
the
respondent
received
a
family
quarters
allowance
and
he
continued
to
receive
to
this
family
quarters
allowance
while
he
was
overseas.
this
amounted
to
$102.50
a
month,
tax
free
and
was
intended
to
provide
housing
for
dependents.
he
also
received
a
subsistence
allowance
of
$42.50
a
month,
similarly
tax
free.
this
was
his
food
allowance.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
both
allowances
were
obtainable
under
any
circumstance
of
service,
whether
it
be
in
the
united
states
or
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
rogovin
the
dependent
--
the
quarters
allowance
depends
on
your
marital
status
and
your
rank.
it
--
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
that's
--
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
i
believe
it's
just
whether
they
are
married
or
--
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
generally,
he
does
not
but
he
can
under
certain
circumstances
--
mr.
rogovin
--
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
it's
the
same
for
all
officers.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
the
respondent
claimed
the
$650
that
was
paid
for
his
food
at
the
officers
mess
at
iwakuni
as
a
deduction
under
162
(a)
(2)
of
the
revenue
code.
on
examination,
the
commissioner
disallowed
this
amount
and
the
respondent
petitioned
the
tax
court
for
redetermination.
the
tax
court
upheld
the
commissioner
and
found
that
the
respondent
was
not
traveling
away
from
home
as
the
term
--
the
word
home
is
used
in
section
162
that
the
respondent's
home
for
the
purposes
of
the
travel
expense
deduction
was
at
his
place
of
employment
which
was
iwakuni,
japan
during
this
period
of
time.
and
further
that
the
respondent
stay
at
iwakuni
was
not
temporary
so
as
to
allow
qualification
under
an
exception
for
temporary
travel
recognized
by
the
revenue
service
and
by
the
tax
court.
the
court
of
appeals
with
one
judge
dissenting
reversed
and
held
that
the
respondent's
home
was
where
his
family
resided,
santa
ana,
california.
thus
while
iwakuni
was
where
he
was
employed,
where
he
was
working,
in
effect,
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
to
the
effect
that
the
term
home
is
to
be
used
in
its
common
and
usual
sense
of
definition,
and
that
home
would
be
where
his
family
resided
at
santa
ana.
now,
the
interplay
of
section
162
(a)
(2)
giving
this
limited
deduction
and
section
262
which
sets
out
the
general
prohibition
against
family
and
living
expenses
was
before
this
court
some
20
years
ago
in
the
flowers
case.
that
time,
this
court
granted
certiorari
because
of
a
conflict
between
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
circuit
as
to
the
meaning
and
the
definition
of
the
term
“home”.
just
as
now,
the
ninth
circuit
using
home
in
its
ordinary
and
usual
sense,
referring
to
residents,
so
20
years
ago,
the
fifth
circuit
had
used
that
same
definition
in
the
flowers
case.
and
in
flowers,
the
three
conditions
that
were
outlined
by
this
court
as
being
prerequisites
that
must
be
met
before
the
deduction
could
be
taken
were
that
the
expense
be
a
reasonable
and
necessary
traveling
expense
that
the
expense
be
incurred
while
away
from
home,
that
they
must
be
incurred
in
the
pursuit
of
business.
now
without
finding
it
necessary
to
resolve
the
conflict
as
to
the
definition
of
home,
this
court
found
that
the
expenses
from
traveling
from
jackson,
mississippi
to
mobile,
alabama
where
the
taxpayer
in
flowers
was
employed
were
not
incurred
in
a
pursuit
of
business.
as
to
what
triggers
the
deduction,
the
court
stated
that
a
travel
expense
deduction
could
arise
only
when
the
employer's
business
forced
the
taxpayer
to
travel
and
to
live
temporarily
at
some
place
other
than
mobile,
the
facts
of
the
flowers
case.
while
this
court
has
not
defined
the
term
“home”,
the
treasury
and
the
majority
of
the
appellate
courts
have
for
many
years
treated
home
to
mean
the
taxpayers'
principal
place
of
business
or
employment.
the
ninth
circuit
says
to
the
contrary,
that
home
in
this
statute
must
be
defined
in
its
ordinary
and
usual
sense.
i
submit
that
dictionary
definitions
will
give
no
extraordinary
insight
into
this
issue.
while
we
are
faced
with
defining
home
in
a
specific
context
of
a
revenue
statute,
affording
a
tax
deduction
against
earned
income.
and
in
the
development
of
the
meaning
for
the
word
“home”,
i
submit
that
it
cannot
be
done
in
isolation
but
rather
it
must
give
purpose
to
the
provision
of
162
(a)
(2)
without
ignoring
the
prohibition
that
personal
living
and
family
expenses
are
generally
not
to
be
deducted.
in
accommodation
of
these
two
competing
statutory
concepts
is
what
is
at
issue
today.
for
example,
my
residence
is
in
annandale,
virginia.
i
work
at
the
department
of
justice's
tenth
in
constitution
in
the
district.
now,
if
we
were
to
use
“home”
in
the
ordinary
and
usual
sentence,
i
would
be
encouraged
to
deduct
the
travel
expenses
coming
to
and
from
work
because
they're
incurred
while
away
from
home,
my
residence,
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
but
clearly,
this
is
a
commutation
expense
that
i
incur.
and
the
regulations
for
many
years
have
said
that
this
is
a
prohibited
deduction.
furthermore,
this
court
in
the
flowers
case
gave
these
same
regulations,
the
force
in
effect
of
law.
so
clearly
from
the
very
outset,
the
word
“home”
has
a
tax
meaning.
i
submit
that
is
in
the
statute,
it
is
a
descriptor.
a
place
from
which
when
you
travel
on
the
pursuit
of
your
trade
or
business,
certain
tax
benefits
would
flow.
now,
the
legislative
history
does
not
shed
much
light
on
the
definition
of
home.
but
we
do
have
a
45-year
consistent
internal
revenue
service
interpretation
of
the
word,
that
taxpayers
generally
are
entitled
to
travel
expense
deductions
only
when
they
are
away
from
their
regular
place
of
employment.
i
submit
that
this
definition
strikes
the
necessary
balance
between
these
two
sections.
and
it
--
when
the
taxpayer
is
away
from
his
regular
place
of
business,
this
triggers
the
applicability
of
section
162.
it
allows
the
traveling
expense
to
be
brought
about
by
the
business
exigencies
of
the
taxpayer
whether
they'd
be
in
the
pursuit
of
this
trade
or
that
of
his
employers.
and
it
also
rules
out
the
deductibility
of
the
personal
or
family
living
expenses
which
are
not
to
be
born
by
the
public
fisk
as
demonstrated
by
section
262.
the
treasury's
view
provides
an
administrable
rule
that
fits
into
this
fabric
of
the
law
and
it
has
been
consistently
interpreted
since
1921.
section
162
(a)
(2)
was
intended
to
ameliorate
financial
hardship
to
taxpayers
who
incur
un-reimbursed
additional
living
expenses
when
they're
traveling
away
from
their
regular
place
of
employment
in
pursuit
of
business,
in
pursuit
of
trade
or
business.
it's
administered
so
as
to
put
this
taxpayer
on
a
parity
with
the
man
who
stays
at
home.
and
it
strikes
this
balance
to
provide
this
limited
exception
to
a
rule
against
the
deductibility
of
living
expenses.
now,
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
allow
deductions
for
living
expenses
while
away
from
the
residence
on
business
with
this
caveat,
unless
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
the
taxpayer
to
move
to
a
place
--
to
his
place
of
employment.
this
i
submit
is
a
very
subjective
qualification
and
it
raises
a
number
of
questions,
was
it
reasonable
to
move?
well,
this
could
be
a
question
of
judgment
values.
was
the
housing
in
the
new
city
adequate?
was
the
climate
such
that
it
would
not
be
deleterious
to
the
family?
or
was
the
schooling
such
that
it
could
equate
with
the
school
system
from
whence
the
taxpayers
to
move?
none
of
these
judgment
values
are
pertinent
to
attacks
on
income
or
the
expenses
to
be
attributed
to
its
earning.
they're
extremely
personal
in
nature.
and
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
tend
to
reject
the
flowers
opinion
of
this
court,
where
the
court
said,
“business
trips
are
to
be
identified
in
relation
to
business
demands
and
the
travelers
business
headquarters,
the
exigencies
of
business
rather
than
the
personal
convenience
and
necessity
of
the
traveler
must
be
a
--
must
be
motivating
factor".
if
the
taxpayer
in
hypothetical
took
the
position
that
he
could
contract
away
his
--
bringing
his
family,
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
taxpayer
in
los
angeles
who
was
an
engineer.
and
he
agrees
in
contractual
dealings
with
a
--
in
alaska
construction
company
that
he'll
go
up
there
for
five
years.
and
furthermore,
they
want
as
a
condition
of
employment
that
he
leaves
his
family
in
los
angeles.
and
to
ensure
that
he
stays
for
five
years,
they
worked
out
an
escrow
arrangement
with
respect
to
his
salary,
to
keep
him
there
for
that
time.
well,
under
these
circumstances,
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
i
would
assume
would
say
that
it
was
not
reasonable
for
him
to
bring
his
family.
it
wasn't
reasonable
because
he
couldn't
do
it.
it
was
an
impossibility
by
way
of
contract.
therefore,
his
travel
at
--
which
was
in
the
pursuit
of
business,
would
under
those
circumstances
i
would
assume
be
deductible.
he
would
have
the
living
expenses
of
his
family
in
los
angeles
and
a
separate
set
of
living
expenses
while
on
alaska.
i
believe
that
this
is
his
personal
choice.
and
that's
the
way
that
my
hypothetical
taxpayer
wished
to
live.
and
that
it's
no
different
than
the
flowers
case.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
applicability
of
the
rule.
you
look
to
the
usual
place
of
employment.
and
that
you
cannot
take
into
consideration
that
the
host
of
judgment
values
of
a
personal
nature
which
may
make
a
man
bring
his
family
across
and
not
to
bring
his
family
to
his
place
of
employment.
mr.
rogovin
i
suggest
--
however,
in
1963,
the
treasury
requested
some
clarifying
legislation
which
that
was
not
enacted.
critical
to
the
ninth
circuit's
viewing
of
this
case
was
their
question
of
whether
the
temporary
verse
is
indefinite
exception
would
apply
to
this
case
and
they
were
quite
critical
of
such
an
exception.
they
considered
a
more
flexible
test
and
their
flex
--
more
flexible
test
would
be
if
the
taxpayer
changes
his
--
he
would
have
to
change
his
tax
home
if
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
known
to
him
that
he
may
be
employed
for
a
long
period
of
time
at
his
new
station.
well,
this
rule,
i
submit,
doesn't
square
with
the
effort
to
equate
home
with
residence.
the
ninth
circuit
uses
a
concept
of
a
tax
home
and
under
certain
circumstances
they
would
say
that
the
place
of
employment
actually
dictates
whether
travel
expense
deductions
could
be
claimed.
the
problem
however
of
the
temporary
travel
and
i
believe
we
must
acknowledge
that
15
months
is
not
a
period
of
time
in
which
you
would
consider
extremely
permanent
at
that
date.
but
we
contend
that
the
question
of
the
length
of
time
that
the
respondent
was
away
is
not
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
this
case.
neither
the
length
of
time
nor
his
intent
become
relevant
because
when
he
left
santa
ana,
california,
he
cut
all
of
his
business
ties
with
that
base.
and
he
was
now
stationed
at
iwakuni,
japan.
he
had
no
business
purpose
to
be
away
from
santa
ana.
he
was
moved
by
the
marine
corp
for
a
15-month
period
to
iwakuni.
and
therefore,
there
is
complete
cleavage
just
as
there
was
a
cleavage
when
he
moved
from
albuquerque
to
santa
ana
and
from
santa
ana
to
iwakuni.
there
was
the
same
cleavage
when
he
left
japan
and
was
transferred
to
cherry
point,
north
carolina.
and
in
each
one
of
these
moves
dictated
by
his
employer,
he
terminated
his
business
contacts
with
the
community
in
which
he
was
living.
the
military
officer's
usual
place
of
work
is
his
permanent
duty
station.
there
is
a
place
where
he
is
assigned
by
the
military
and
it's
inherent
in
military
life.
the
professional
soldier's
life
is
regimented
to
a
degree
unparalleled
in
civilian
life.
we
certainly
recognized
the
many
military
posts
that
are
throughout
this
world.
and
the
frequency
of
transfer
from
one
post
to
another
is
a
constant
factor
in
military
life.
the
permanent
duty
station
is
not
only
clearly
the
place
of
employment
of
the
military
officer,
but
such
a
station
has
many
of
the
attributes
of
a
resident
community
as
well.
under
those
circumstances
where
the
family
or
dependents
are
allowed
to
travel
with
the
military
man,
base
housing
or
quarters
are
provided.
many
of
these
stations
or
camps
or
bases
have
developed
into
self-contained
communities
where
there
are
schools
and
churches
and
commissaries,
pxs,
dispensaries,
clubs
and
post
theaters.
and
these
attributes,
plus
the
system
of
tax
free
allowances
makes
the
frequency
of
change
of
duty
stations
less
burdensome.
so
it
is
to
give
military
officers
who
have
a
permanent
duty
station,
a
deduction
under
section
162
(a)
(2)
for
traveling
expenses
when
they
are
away
from
where
their
family
resides
would
be
--
i
submit
it
an
unwarranted
tax
windfall.
and
that
conflicts
with
the
purposes
of
section
162
(a)
(2)
and
section
262
which
in
combination
forbid
the
deduction
of
a
normal
living
expense.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
rogovin
it's
by
--
mr.
rogovin
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
there
are
a
number
of
circumstances
--
categories.
and
here
we
have
--
with
respect
to
people
finding
this
deduction
the
vast
bulk
of
the
public
involved
in
this
travel
away
from
home
deduction
are
people
who
lived
in
the
same
community
they
worked
in.
now,
we're
dealing
with
a
--
mr.
rogovin
--
a
separate
group,
not
of
the
military.
but
it
need
not
be
just
in
military.
you
can
envision
the
man
working
for
a
hotel
chain
and
they
moved
him
from
city
to
city
to
manage
their
hotels.
under
these
circumstances
i
believe
that
it's
quite
persuasive
to
view
the
employer's
intent
especially
when
you
have
a
career
employee
involved.
and
if
the
employer
believes
that
it's
for
the
business
--
the
best
interest
of
the
business
to
move
a
particular
employee
from
city
a
to
city
b,
from
station
a
to
station
b,
and
this
is
a
permanent
move
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
i
think
this
is
a
very
persuasive
factor
to
consider.
mr.
rogovin
it's
our
understanding
from
discussions
with
the
military
that
movements
--change
of
duty
that
the
ex
--
where
the
period
of
time
will
exceed,
i
think
five
or
six
months
will
be
considered
to
be
a
permanent
move
on
the
part
of
the
military.
and
certain
advantages
flow
from
orders
that
are
cut
in
that
nature.
when
a
man
is
moved
from
one
military
base
to
another
on
a
permanent
move,
he
receives
dislocation
allowances,
he
receives
per
diem
in
travel,
he
receives
an
expense
for
his
family
as
well,
and
his
dependents
as
well
as
his
own
travel.
on
the
other
hand,
when
a
man
is
given
temporary
duty
from
one
base
where
he
works
and
is
sent
somewhere
else
for
a
period
of
time,
he
receives
per
diem
but
he
cannot
move
his
family.
in
this
case,
captain
stidger
on
five
occasions
was
on
temporary
duty
from
iwakuni.
he
went
out
and
was
gone
a
period
of
time
17
and
20
minute
--
20
days
and
would
return.
and
as
to
these
movements,
we
would
consider
that
this
type
of
travel
is
the
type
covered
by
section
162
(a)
(2).
mr.
rogovin
the
service
had
a
ruling
out,
chief
justice,
dealing
with
naval
officers.
and
it
was
general
in
its
factual
pattern
that
a
naval
officer
who
is
aboard
ship
would
be
put
in
the
position
of
being
away
from
home
because
his
home
port
was
considered
his
usual
place
of
employment.
in
further
pursuing
and
discussing
this
with
the
service,
the
basic
premise
there
was
that
that
naval
officer
was
comparable
to
the
trainmen
or
the
airplane
pilot
or
the
truck
drivers
who
would
have
a
terminal
point
allowed
for
relatively
short
period
of
time
and
return.
under
those
circumstances,
the
ruling
would
prevail.
the
service
is
now
reconsidering
whether
there
is
a
broad
or
factual
pattern
covered
by
service
aboard
ship
than
the
premise
upon
which
they
based
the
ruling.
mr.
rogovin
to
the
extent
that
a
naval
officer
is
assigned
a
ship
and
the
--
i
think
quickly
of
a
relatively
small
ship
on
the
west
coast
that
may
go
out
for
a
couple
of
days,
maybe
out
for
a
couple
of
weeks.
but
the
home
port
is
the
usual
place
of
employment
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
he
is
on
travel
status.
and
when
he
is
afloat,
when
a
ship
is
out
to
sea,
then
he
would
be
in
a
travel
position.
this
is
like
the
commercial
fisherman
who
was
out
for
three
or
four
weeks
at
a
time
but
returns
to
his
home
port
that
being
his
usual
place
for
employment.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
it
could
be
--
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
it
could
be
so
interpreted
and
the
service
has
indicated
that
it
is
going
to
reexamine
--
mr.
rogovin
--
that
matter
situation.
mr.
rogovin
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
it
would
be
construed
as
consistent
as
to
those
cases
where
a
man
is
gone
for
two
years
at
sea
duty.
mr.
rogovin
that's
--
mr.
rogovin
i
-
i
could
not
say.
i
don't
believe
that
two
years
isn't
a
normal
thing
to
--
mr.
rogovin
--
for
a
period
of
time.
mr.
rogovin
i
don't
believe
justice
warren
that
the
man
would
be
at
sea
for
15
consecutive
months.
i
believe
it
would
--
as
i
understand
it'd
be
perhaps
no
more
than
six
or
eight
months,
and
then
they
would
come
back
to
port.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
they
would
be
able
to
deduct
them.
mr.
rogovin
oh,
i
believe
it
was
made
initially
in
some
years
back
because
the
consideration
was
that
--
the
ships
were
gone
for
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
and
did
not
consider
the
potential
of
an
atomic
submarine
that
could
remain
out
in
the
pacific
for
a
great
length
of
time,
over
a
year
perhaps.
and
this
is
what
is
being
reconsidered.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
they
are
able
to
deduct
their
meals.
mr.
rogovin
because
the
premise
of
the
naval
officer's
deduction
is
that
his
home
port
is
his
usual
place
of
employment.
this
premise
i
believe
is
questionable
on
the
factual
matter
when
you
deal
with
an
officer
who
was
aboard
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
mr.
rogovin
that
ruling?
mr.
rogovin
in
1955,
that
feature
of
the
ruling
was
stated
but
it
goes
back
more
than
that.
it
goes
back
in
the
1920's
and
1930's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
rogovin
well,
this
--
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
that
--
mr.
rogovin
well,
there
is
--
justice
warren,
there
is
no
regulation
involved.
there
is
a
ruling,
of
1955
ruling
that
specifically
says
that
this
type
of
duty
would
not
be
construed
as
being
away
from
home.
but
this
is
merely
a
construction
--
further
addition
of
the
position
that
has
been
in
existence
since
1921.
mr.
rogovin
the
away
from
home
or
the
military
rulings?
mr.
rogovin
in
19
--
no
sir,
the
fourth
circuit
viewed
a
similar
situation
where
a
1941
officer
was
assigned
to
a
military
base
--
mr.
rogovin
1941,
and
upheld
the
government's
position.
mr.
rogovin
the
subsistence
allowance
approximately
$42
and
50
cents.
mr.
rogovin
it
is
by
--
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
the
government
and
the
revenue
service
has
maintained
that
such
subsistence
allowances
are
not
taxable.
having
taken
that
position,
do
not
believe
that
requiring
a
netting
of
the
deduction
claimed
against
that
which
he
has
received
tax
free
would
be
an
appropriate
administrative
act
to
take
because
it
would
be
making
a
distinction
between
those
officers
who
are
away
from
home,
away
from
their
residence
and
those
who
are
living
at
home.
mr.
rogovin
i
would
think
that
the
service
would
want
to
reexamine
its
position
with
respect
to
these
allowances.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
at
iwakuni.
mr.
rogovin
no,
he
was
given
these
quarters
free.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
rogovin
$65
a
month.
for
10
months,
that's
how
the
$650
figure
was
reached.
mr.
rogovin
which
is
not
an
issue
--
mr.
rogovin
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
rogovin
for
the
actual
days
in
travel?
mr.
rogovin
he
did
receive
a
per
diem.
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
i
believe
the
frequency
of
change
of
duty
station
is
a
normal
factor.
the
allowances
that
are
involved
are
normal
factors.
there
are
duty
stations
throughout
the
world
where
a
family
is
not
permitted.
i
would
think
that
many
stations
in
vietnam
would
be
of
that
nature.
certainly,
during
world
war
ii,
you
can
think
of
many
situations.
and
in
the
record,
the
marine
corps
order
which
prohibited
the
--
of
the
family
from
going
with
captain
stidger
indicated
the
four
reasons
that
they
would
not
do
so,
so
that
it's
possible
that
it
would
--
is
at
page
28
of
the
record.
they
would
take
into
consideration
the
adverse
effect
that
the
presence
of
the
dependents
might
have
on
a
unit's
mission,
operational
readiness,
or
combat
capability,
second,
the
existence
of
suitable
dependents
facilities
for
all
married
personnel,
third,
the
standards
of
living
and
the
general
desirability
of
the
area,
and
fourth,
the
political
climate
obtaining
in
the
country
is
considered.
so
that
these
were
considerations
as
to
whether
or
not
the
family
would
be
allowed
to
go
over
with
the
officer.
mr.
rogovin
there
had
been
decisions
on
the
question
of
whether
home
is
residence.
the
fifth
circuit
in
flowers,
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
number
of
instances,
and
possibly
the
sixth
circuit
to
be
interpreted
in
saying
home
should
be
read
as
the
residence
and
not
usual
place
of
employment.
all
the
other
circuits
say
for
the
first
which
i
don't
believe
this
commented
on
the
issue
have
all
maintained
what
the
government's
position
that
home
should
be
construed
as
usual
place
of
employment.
as
to
the
military
feature,
the
only
other
case
was
the
bercaw
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
the
government
was
upheld.
mr.
rogovin
soon
after
the
war,
yes
sir.
mr.
rogovin
thank
you.
