justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rogovin,
in
your
statement,
you
said
he
was
permanently
assigned
to
--
or
something
to
that
effect,
assigned
in
a
permanent
station
in
the
pacific.
what's
the
basis
of
the
word
permanent?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
was
officially
designated
as
a
permanent
duty
station?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
may
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
may
have
some
significance
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
and
as
a
--
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
--
i
don't
want
you
to
take
your
time
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
perhaps
at
some
point,
you
can
tell
me
whether
there
is
anything
in
this
record
that
characterizes
that
duty
station
as
permanent.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rogovin,
i
wonder
if
there
really
is
much
to
be
said
here
in
terms
of
equities
or
tax
considerations
of
any
substantial
nature.
suppose
this
officer
had
been
sent
from
iwakuni
or
whatever
it
is
to
somewhere
else
for
12
months,
what
would
--
how
--
what
would
you
look
to
find
out
whether
where
his
tax
home
was?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
arrived
in
iwakuni,
carrying
these
orders
then
they
told
him
to
go
somewhere
else,
to
go
to
korea
or
somewhere
else,
now
what
are
the
factors
to
--
that
you
think
are
permissible
for
the
commission
to
look
to,to
determine
what
is
his
“tax
home"
curious
concept
itself?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
still
not
satisfied
this
was
a
permanent
move.
the
tax
court
found
that
his
stay
there
in
iwakuni
was
indefinite,
indeterminate
or
permanent
and
not
temporary.
that's
on
page
53.
i
don't
know
whether
you've
got
anything
else
on
that.
but
in
any
event,
what
--
suppose
he
were
move
from
iwakuni
to
somewhere
else
in
12
months?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
reed,
what
do
you
do
with
mr.
rogovin's
illustration?
he
says
he
lives
in
annandale,
which
is
in
virginia,
works
in
washington
and
he
says
that
he's
nevertheless
--
his
home
in
annandale
--
he's
nevertheless
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
cost
of
his
lunches
at
the
department
of
justice
cafeteria.
his
wife
feed
him
for
about
10
cents
for
lunch,
incremental
costs
of
his
lunch.
there,
he
has
to
go
down
to
the
department
of
justice,
go
to
cafeteria,
and
spend
vast
sums
for
lunch?
justice
abe
fortas
he
says
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
yes,
but
in
theory,
that
is
to
say
if
we
are
going
to
engage
in
(inaudible)
to
getting
to
believe
is
the
dubious
exercise
of
logic
as
applied
to
this
problem.
in
theory,
doesn't
he
have
a
point
that
justifies
what
was
done
in
the
case
before
us?
that
is
to
say
he
says
that,
this
illustration
shows
that
home
for
tax
purposes.
and
mr.
rogovin's
case
shows
that
home
for
tax
purposes
is
something
other
than
home
where
the
wife
and
the
children
are.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
reed,
i
noticed
in
the
government's
brief
a
reference
to
the
action
taken
by
the
congress
with
respect
to
congressmen
that
is
to
say
that
the
writing
for
a
specific
sum,
legislating
a
specific
sum,
which
they
may
deduct
for
their
expenses
while
in
washington.
now
what
about
that
a
congressman
has
his
home
in
tennessee,
let's
say,
and
he
keeps
--
maintains
his
home
there.
and
then
he
comes
to
washington
where
he
has
expenses,
living
expenses,
expenses
incident
to
performance
of
his
duty
as
a
congressman.
now
leaving
legislation
aside,
what
in
principle
would
be
the
application
of
the
statutory
provision
to
that
case?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
his
family
shouldn't
be
living
here
maybe
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
one
reason
or
another.
i
said
maybe.
i
don't
know
if
that's
so,
an
assumption.
but
with
mr.
rogovin's
argument,
and
is
it
congress
seems
to
have
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
the
congressman,
the
home
would
be
washington
because
congress
specifically
legislated
that
$3000
or
whatever
it
is
could
be
fitted
as
deductible
in
lieu
--
as
deductible
expenses
$3000
of
the
cost
of
living
here
in
washington.
and
that
congress
proceeded
in
other
words
on
the
theory
that
his
--
that
the
congressman's
home
for
tax
purposes
was
his
principal
place
of
business,
namely
washington,
that's
the
argument.
and
if
that
is
so
in
this
kind
of
--
in
this
field
in
which
one
rather
desperately
seeks
a
place
to
which
to
moor
one's
mind,
isn't
the
--
what
do
you
say,
is
that
helpful
or
what
is
the
effect
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
ordinarily,
he
would
--
by
ordinary
principles
of
construction,
i
suspect
that
you
would
take
that
as
in
effect
the
congressional
revalidation
of
the
services
interpretation
at
least
in
prior,
because
that
would
indicate
very
clearly
that
as
you
stated,
congress
did
know
of
the
service's
construction.
now,
the
term
home
for
this
purpose,
and
that
then
instead
of
changing
it,
across
the
board,
this
congress
modified
not
only
in
the
case
of
--
or
made
a
partial
exception
only
in
the
case
of
congressmen
and
not
about
--
and
now
what
you'd
do
as
a
matter
of
conventional
legal
technique?
justice

mr.
