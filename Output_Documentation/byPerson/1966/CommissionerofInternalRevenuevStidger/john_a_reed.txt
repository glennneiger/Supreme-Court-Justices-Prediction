mr.
john
a.
reed
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
decision
below.
first,
in
answer
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
fortas,
i
agree
with
rogovin
that
the
--
captain
stidges
orders
assigning
him
to
the
far
east
are
not
in
the
record.
there
is
in
the
record
however
the
--
a
marine
corps
procedure
in
such
cases
which
became
effective
a
few
months
--
while
captain
stidger
was
in
japan,
which
outlines
the
regular
tours
of
duty
of
abroad
of
marine
personnel
and
says
that
for
a
tour
of
duty
where
he
was,
his
tour
of
duty
will
be
15
months.
captain
stidger
testified
that
before
the
tax
court
that
when
he
went
over
there,
it
had
the
similar
procedures
had
said
14
months
and
that
he
was
increased
a
month
while
he
was
there.
as
far
as
the
meaning
of
the
word
permanent
duty
station.
again
in
question
of
justice
fortas,
in
revenue
ruling
55-571,
again
i
agree
with
mr.
rogovin
that
that
is
a
term
appearing
in
the
u.s.
code
and
it
said
in
title
37
on
paying
allowances
of
the
armed
services.
and
it
pretty
much
says
that
whatever
the
commandant
said
it
is
but
it
refers
to
a
shore
station
or
home
port.
it
obviously
ties
in
it
seems
to
me
with
tours
of
duty
as
outlined
in
the
marine
procedures
so
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
yes
sir,
that's
--
it
was
the
old
section
253
of
title
37,
its
since
been
given
a
new
number.
mr.
john
a.
reed
and
so
the
--
when
the
--
this
revenue
ruling
about
permanent
duty
stations
which
was
first
promulgated
in
1955
and
i
think
had
no
counterpart
in
any
earlier
ruling.
i
disagree
with
mr.
rogovin,
i
don't
think
--
it
certainly
hadn't
been
announced
before
1955
as
the
policy
of
the
service.
when
it
says
that
an
officer
in
the
armed
services
on
permanent
duty
abroad
may
not
deduct
his
meals
abroad
whether
or
not
he
is
prohibit
from
taking
his
family
with
him.
i
think
that
was
a
completely
new
approach.
i
think
it
undoubtedly
was
--
it
got
that
word
permanent
duty
station
was
taken
over
from
the
statute
on
paying
allowances.
and
i
think
permanent
in
that
sense
meant
15
months
or
18
months
or
up
to
three
years
in
the
marines.
that
--
this
is
the
maximum
tour
of
duty
according
to
the
record.
so
i
think
permanent
is
--
in
a
text
sense
is
a
misnomer
and
i
don't
say
any
reason
to
use
this
permanent
as
distinguished
from
temporary.
in
the
text
sense,
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
give
any
weight
to
what
the
pay
in
allowances
provision
of
the
statutes
may
say.
how
it
may
characterize
it.
now,
back
to
the
--
i
agree
generally
with
mr.
rogovin's
statement
of
the
facts
with
one
or
two
exceptions.
i
think
that
captain
stidger
testified
that
he
was
ordered
to
the
far
east
rather
than
in
--
rather
than
to
iwakuni
and
the
marine
procedures
indicate
--
confirmed
that,
the
marine
procedure
reproduced
in
the
record
at
pages
24
to
31.
and
actually
the
--
he
was
not
always
at
iwakuni.
he
moved
around
at
good
deal
around
the
far
east
and
in
the
taxable
year
of
1958,
the
account
of
the
year
involved,
he
is
claiming
deduction
for
only
ten
of
the
--
ten
months.
and
the
record,
the
--
his
itinerary
reproduced
in
the
record,
page
16
of
the
record,
if
my
addition
is
correct,
it
shows
--
is
correct,
shows
that
he
was
only
in
iwakuni
during
this
taxable
year
for
approximately
240
days
or
eight
months.
and
so
that
i
submit
that
he
is
for
the
other
two
months
approximately
of
the
deductions
claimed,
he
was
at
other
point
--
other
military
post
in
the
far
east.
and
he
testified
he
ate
almost
entirely
at
various
officers'
messes.
and
so
i
think
that
is
somewhat
analogous
to
justice
fortas'
query
as
to
what
happens
if
he
is
transferred
from
iwakuni?
mr.
john
a.
reed
he
was
out
of
united
states
a
little
over
11
months.
but
he
was
only
at
iwakuni
eight
months.
and
the
itinerary
at
page
16
shows
the
rest
of
that
term.
he
was
at
other
places
in
japan
and
philippine
islands.
he
came
back
to
california
for
two
months
in
the
middle
of
--
two
weeks
and
in
the
middle
of
it.
so
we
do
have
involved
here
to
some
extent
at
least,
say
two
months
worth
or
two
times
$65
a
month,
the
--
something
very
analogous
it
seems
to
me
to
the
revenue
ruling
571,
that's
the
ruling
reconsidered
in
the
letter
in
the
reply
brief,
something
very
analogous
to
a
naval
officer
whose
permanent
base
is
considered
to
be
let's
say
iwakuni
and
he's
considered
to
be
on
temporary
duty
afloat
if
he
will,
although
he
actually,
i
think
he
went
by
plane
from
naval
station
to
naval
station.
and
i
would
think
that
as
to
two
months
approximately,
that
even
mr.
rogovin
would
concede
that
the
deduction
is
allowed
on
any
event,
on
anything
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i'm
not
sure,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
brief
is
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
--
i
don't
know
what
their
--
had
--
what
the
government's
position
is
on
these
two
months,
mr.
justice.
but
perhaps
mr.
rogovin
will
enlighten
us.
mr.
john
a.
reed
240
days
at
iwakuni
during
the
calendar
year
58.
mr.
john
a.
reed
10
months
mr.
john
a.
reed
and
captain
stidger
testified
on
that
and
--
before
the
tax
court
that
he
did
moved
around
from
point
to
point
and
that
he
got
his
meals
wherever
he
could.
he
ordinarily
paid
for
his
meals
at
officers'
messes
as
he
said.
he
was
appearing
without
counsel
as
you
know.
mr.
john
a.
reed
iwakuni.
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
he
did
for
49
days
and
for
those
49
days
for
which
he
did
get
his
per
diem
allowance,
he
is
claiming
no
deduction.
and
that
explains
to
a
large
extent
why
he
is
only
claiming
a
deduction
for
10
months
of
the
calendar
year
58
rather
than
12
months,
the
49
days
are
--
that
deal
with
the
other
two
months
that
two
plus
10
is
12.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
think
the
other
two
weeks
are
the
two
weeks
that
he
got
back
to
california
in
mid-december.
i
don't
believe
that
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
aren't
all
controlling
in
this
case.
the
victim
from
the
opinion
of
--
majority
opinion
in
the
flowers
case
which
justice
rogovin
read
and
--
which
mr.
rogovin
read
which
appears
on
page
12
of
my
brief,
i
don't
read
it
as
contrary
to
the
position
here
where
justice
murphy
said
--
writing
for
the
court
said
that
the
exigencies
of
business
rather
than
the
personal
conveniences
and
necessities
of
the
traveler
must
be
the
motivating
factors.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
contend
that
we
have
involved
here
captain
stidger's
personal
conveniences
and
necessities.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
rather
read
that
as
very
much
to
the
same
at
least
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
that
it
all
depends
on
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
for
the
taxpayer
to
move
his
family
to
where
he
went.
and
i
certainly
think
that
in
the
flowers
case
involving
the
railroad
lawyer
down
south
it
would
have
been
quite
reasonable
for
them
--
for
him
to
move
his
family
to
his
new
post
of
duty.
so
i
don't
think
the
flowers
case
is
really
--
certainly
no
more
as
--
doesn't
support
the
government
any
more
than
the
taxpayer
if
as
much.
the
other
--
only
other
opinion
of
this
court,
the
peurifoy
case
in
1958
i
believe.
again,
i
think
the
majority
opinion
went
out
from
procedural
grounds
and
i
don't
believe
that
it's
really
took
a
position
on
the
meaning
of
home
or
the
meaning
of
temporary.
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
douglas
in
which
justices
black
and
whittaker
joined,
it
seems
to
me
to
say
substantially
what
the
majority
of
what
the
court
below
said
and
substantially
what
i
tried
to
say
in
my
brief.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
i
think
really
doesn't
throw
much
light
on
the
meaning
of
it
except
for
perhaps
that
these
--
the
63
history.
the
63
recommendation
of
the
treasury
department
to
congress
admitting
there
was
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
in
this
area
suggested
that
the
statute
be
rewritten
to
be
more
definite
and
perhaps
the
salient
feature
of
the
proposed
legislation
would
have
been
to
impose
an
absolute
limit
of
12
months
on
temporary
absence.
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
rejected
that
legislation
perhaps
raises
some
inference
that
it
didn't
want
any
limit
on
12
months.
mr.
rogovin
says
the
length
of
time
is
not
relevant
but
i
don't
think
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
ever
publicly
so
stated
in
all
the
--
all
their
publications
and
indicated
the
length
of
time
is
very
relevant
and
that
they
will
very
rarely
allow
an
absence
of
more
than
12
months
to
be
treated
as
temporary.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
basic
temporary
rule
which
is
perhaps
important
here.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
the
service's
position,
it
is
that
home
is
duly
to
be
construed
as
meaning
a
principal
place
of
business.
but
they
recognized
that
if
a
man
is
only
traveling
for
a
short
time
of
course
or
even
if
he
moves
to
a
new
place
of
business
but
is
only
going
--
only
thinks
he's
going
to
be
there
temporarily,
they
recognized
that
that
would
be
on
--
it
seems
to
me
they
recognized
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
ask
him
to
move
his
family
and
unreasonable
to
deny
him
the
deduction
for
his
meals
let's
say
as
a
temporary
place
of
employment
in
view
of
the
duplicate
expenses
he
has
--
where
he
came
from
for
his
family
and
living
expenses.
and
so
that
the
government's
temporary
rule
started
off
as
equitable,
fair,
and
sensible.
but
they
have
--
i
submit
they
have
not
followed
it
to
its
logical
conclusion.
some
were
along
the
line
and
they
decided
that
they
didn't
want
to
extend
it
very
far.
they've
been
limiting
it.
i
don't
know
why.
they've
generally
say
that
it
shouldn't
be
for
more
than
12
months.
and
somewhere
along
the
line,
i
think
they've
gone
off
the
track.
i
don't
think
that
the
period
of
time
should
be
relevant.
it
seems
to
me
even
a
man
in
the
far
east
for
two
years
or
three
years
prohibited
from
at
least
--
he's
prohibited
from
taking
his
family
and
has
duplicate
expenses
at
home
should
be
allowed
to
deduction.
mr.
rogovin
says
that
the
government
is
relying
here
not
on
the
fact
that
captain
stidger
was
overseas
for
14
or
15
months,
but
that's
alright.
but
that
fact
that
he
cut
his
business
ties
with
the
--
in
california
and
had
no
business
purpose
to
be
away
from
california,
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
the
construction
work
as
ruling
issued
by
the
service
in
1960
is
to
the
contrary.
it
says
that
they
will
no
longer
consider
whether
the
employer
had
a
business
purpose
or
the
employee
--
for
what
the
employee
did
and
they
would
--
and
they
will
admit
that
if
the
employee
--
they
will
admit
that
an
employee
may
have
a
business
purpose
for
moving
his
--
the
places
where
he
works.
and
if
there
is
an
employee's
business
purpose,
that's
enough.
well,
it
seems
to
me
captain
stidger
didn't
have
a
business
purpose
to
be
away
from
california.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
would
not
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
would
not
permit
mr.
rogovin
to
deduct
his
lunch.
i
think
perhaps
the
simplest
way
to
address
the
opinion
on
would
be
on
that
point
--
would
be
to
say
that
his
home
is
the
entire
area
including
a
big
circle
including
annandale
and
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
don't
think
so,
perhaps
this
--
perhaps
there's
a
logical,
theoretical
point
there
but
i
would
think
this
court
in
the
footnote
to
its
opinion
in
this
case
could
make
it
clear
that
it
wasn't
covering
that
situation.
i
really
think
the
best
way
to
do
that
would
be
to
draw
--
say
that
he
is
at
home
whether
he
is
in
the
place
where
he
works
or
he
lives
in
the
suburbs.
at
home,
in
other
words,
covers
in
a
radius
of
--
quite
a
large
radius.
mr.
john
a.
reed
mr.
weisman
(ph)
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
have
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
mr.
john
a.
reed
yes.
mr.
john
a.
reed
what
you
make
out
of
that,
i
think
a
--
i
think
part
of
the
work
here
can
be
done
by
the
ordinary
and
necessary
part
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
you
can
only
deduct
the
expenses
if
they
are
really
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
the
business.
and
i
think
that
even
though
you
have
a
child
at
home
that
you
can
take
care
of
cases
like
that
under
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
really
don't
think
that
that
should
affect
the
result
of
this
case.
now,
mr.
rogovin's
analogy
of
captain
stidger
really
having
no
business
ties
except
iwakuni
and
therefore
not
being
away
from
home.
perhaps
the
--
perhaps
an
analogy
to
be
considered
in
that
connection
is
the
case
of
the
traveling
salesman
who
is
on
the
road
virtually
all
the
time
and
really
has
no
place
of
business,
no
fixed
place
of
business.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
such
a
person
is
allowed
to
deduct
his
expenses
for
meals
other
traveling
expenses
on
the
road.
at
least
if
he
has
a
duplication
in
living
expenses,
at
least
if
he
has
a
family
and
a
home
somewhere
and
i
refer
to
several
cases
to
that
effect
are
cited
at
page
20
of
my
brief.
and
all
those
cases
indicate
that
it's
crucial
whether
or
not
there
is
a
duplication
in
expenses.
seriously
enough,
the
government
publication
of
your
income
tax
put
out
each
year
to
help
taxpayers
make
out
their
income
tax
returns
says
flatly
that
the
traveling
salesman
may
deduct
their
expenses.
doesn't
even
indicate
that
there
has
to
be
a
duplication
in
expenses
but
all
the
cases
insisted
there'd
be
a
duplication
in
expenses.
now,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
rogovin
has
argued
too
seriously
the
tax
windfall
point.
i
don't
really
think
there
is
any
tax
windfall
here
for
servicemen.
it's
true
that
the
base
--
these
basic
subsistence
allowances
as
far
as
subsistence
are
--
have
always
been
treated
as
not
subject
to
income
tax.
but
captain
stidger
got
the
same
pay
in
the
far
east
as
he
had
in
california,
he
got
the
same
subsistence
allowance
in
the
far
east
that
he
had
while
he
was
in
california.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
had
additional
expenses
in
the
far
east
for
meals.
these
10
months
of
meals
at
$65
a
month
which
he
didn't
have
back
in
california.
and
that
it's
fair
and
equitable
that
he'd
be
allowed
the
deduction.
and
it
seems
to
me
entirely
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
he
--
i
think
in
this
--
he
can
deduct
his
expenses
only
if
he's
away
from
home.
i
think
for
that
purpose,
he
can
only
have
one
home,
either
his
home
district
or
washington
--
district
of
columbia.
and
i
think
the
--
one
of
the
questions
is
where
--
which
--
in
which
of
those
two
place
does
he
do
most
of
his
work?
which
is
really
his
principal
place
of
business?
and
is
it
reasonable
--
under
my
approach
at
least,
is
it
reasonable
tax
wise
to
expect
him
to
move
his
family
to
washington,
to
the
district
of
columbia?
and
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
guess
that
his
principal
work
would
be
here,
that
he
would
be
here
most
of
the
time,
at
least
today,
and
perhaps
not
in
1920
or
1921,
when
this
statute
was
enacted.
and
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
treat
this
as
his
tax
home
because
it's
where
his
family
should
be
living,
if
they
aren't
living
here.
mr.
john
a.
reed
and
therefore,
he
should
only
be
allowed
of
his
expenses
back
in
the
home
district.
mr.
john
a.
reed
should
not
be.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
don't
think
it's
really
relevant
to
this
case,
mr.
justice.
i
think
congress
recognized
that
the
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service
was
that
congressman
could
not
deduct
living
expenses
in
washington,
on
the
theory
that
washington
was
his
called
“home”
for
tax
purposes.
and
in
the
light
of
that
attitude
and
having
lost
at
least
one
court
decision
in
the
tax
court
on
the
point
involving
a
congressman,
the
congress
enacted
this
legislation
which
said
that
in
the
case
of
the
congressman,
washington
shall
not
be
considered
as
home
but
rather
his
home
district.
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
i
agree
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
that
even
under
the
approach
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
that
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached
for
a
congressman
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
specific
statute.
i
think
that
it
would
have
followed
that
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
him
to
move
his
family
to
washington.
just
as
in
the
flowers
case,
the
railroad
lawyer
should
have
moved
his
family.
and
the
--
so
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
get
the
same
result
without
specific
legislation
for
the
congressman
either
under
the
government
approach
in
this
case
or
under
the
approach
of
the
court
below
in
this
case.
so
i
don't
really
think
that
what
congress
did
in
1952
is
very
prudent.
mr.
john
a.
reed
yes.
well,
i
would
say
first
that
the
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
bercaw
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
this
case.
that
involved
a
man
who
lived
on
a
farm
in
virginia
and
who
would
--
who
was
just
enlisted
in
the
army
and
was
assigned
to
duty
in
somewhere
in
maryland.
and
he
didn't
see
fit
to
move
his
family
from
virginia
to
maryland.
now
true,
it
was
--
there
was
something
said
about
--
sort
of
a
shortage
of
-
war
time
shortage
of
housing
around
the
base
in
maryland.
but
certainly,
he
could
have
move
closer
to
his
base
than
his
farm.
and
i
don't
think
that
in
that
case,
the
deduction
should
have
been
allowed.
i
don't
think
the
expenses
were
ordinary
and
necessary.
i
think
on
the
balance
in
the
aggregate,
the
family
has
a
unit
where
undoubtedly
better
off
living
with
the
rest
of
the
family
living
on
the
farm
in
virginia,
than
they
would
have
been
regardless
of
the
tax
deduction
in
that
consequences,
if
they
had
moved
the
family,
say
somewhere
between
washington
and
this
army
post
in
maryland.
so
i
don't
think
that
that
was
a
clean
cut
decision
at
all.
and
i
disagree
with
mr.
rogovin
when
he
says
the
1955
ruling
went
back
before
that.
i
think
it
was
first
announced
in
1955.
i
was
thinking
now
of
the
part
of
the
ruling
that
says
that
officers
on
permanent
duty
abroad
may
not
--
are
not
entitled
to
any
tax
deduction
even
though
it's
impossible
for
them
to
take
their
families
with
them.
i
find
nothing
before
1955
announcing
that.
and
indeed,
very
little
reference
to
it
after
1955
in
the
books.
in
fact
it's
significant
that
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
i
reproduced
some
excerpts
from
a
pamphlet
distributed
by
the
navy,
to
servicemen
which
does
not
reproduce
--
does
not
take
that
approach
at
all.
it
simply
says
that
they
cannot
deduct
the
expenses
overseas
for
an
indefinite
period.
and
it's
interesting
to
speculate
on
why
they
don't
reproduce
that
1955
ruling.
mr.
john
a.
reed
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
decision
below.
first,
in
answer
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
fortas,
i
agree
with
rogovin
that
the
--
captain
stidges
orders
assigning
him
to
the
far
east
are
not
in
the
record.
there
is
in
the
record
however
the
--
a
marine
corps
procedure
in
such
cases
which
became
effective
a
few
months
--
while
captain
stidger
was
in
japan,
which
outlines
the
regular
tours
of
duty
of
abroad
of
marine
personnel
and
says
that
for
a
tour
of
duty
where
he
was,
his
tour
of
duty
will
be
15
months.
captain
stidger
testified
that
before
the
tax
court
that
when
he
went
over
there,
it
had
the
similar
procedures
had
said
14
months
and
that
he
was
increased
a
month
while
he
was
there.
as
far
as
the
meaning
of
the
word
permanent
duty
station.
again
in
question
of
justice
fortas,
in
revenue
ruling
55-571,
again
i
agree
with
mr.
rogovin
that
that
is
a
term
appearing
in
the
u.s.
code
and
it
said
in
title
37
on
paying
allowances
of
the
armed
services.
and
it
pretty
much
says
that
whatever
the
commandant
said
it
is
but
it
refers
to
a
shore
station
or
home
port.
it
obviously
ties
in
it
seems
to
me
with
tours
of
duty
as
outlined
in
the
marine
procedures
so
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
yes
sir,
that's
--
it
was
the
old
section
253
of
title
37,
its
since
been
given
a
new
number.
mr.
john
a.
reed
and
so
the
--
when
the
--
this
revenue
ruling
about
permanent
duty
stations
which
was
first
promulgated
in
1955
and
i
think
had
no
counterpart
in
any
earlier
ruling.
i
disagree
with
mr.
rogovin,
i
don't
think
--
it
certainly
hadn't
been
announced
before
1955
as
the
policy
of
the
service.
when
it
says
that
an
officer
in
the
armed
services
on
permanent
duty
abroad
may
not
deduct
his
meals
abroad
whether
or
not
he
is
prohibit
from
taking
his
family
with
him.
i
think
that
was
a
completely
new
approach.
i
think
it
undoubtedly
was
--
it
got
that
word
permanent
duty
station
was
taken
over
from
the
statute
on
paying
allowances.
and
i
think
permanent
in
that
sense
meant
15
months
or
18
months
or
up
to
three
years
in
the
marines.
that
--
this
is
the
maximum
tour
of
duty
according
to
the
record.
so
i
think
permanent
is
--
in
a
text
sense
is
a
misnomer
and
i
don't
say
any
reason
to
use
this
permanent
as
distinguished
from
temporary.
in
the
text
sense,
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
give
any
weight
to
what
the
pay
in
allowances
provision
of
the
statutes
may
say.
how
it
may
characterize
it.
now,
back
to
the
--
i
agree
generally
with
mr.
rogovin's
statement
of
the
facts
with
one
or
two
exceptions.
i
think
that
captain
stidger
testified
that
he
was
ordered
to
the
far
east
rather
than
in
--
rather
than
to
iwakuni
and
the
marine
procedures
indicate
--
confirmed
that,
the
marine
procedure
reproduced
in
the
record
at
pages
24
to
31.
and
actually
the
--
he
was
not
always
at
iwakuni.
he
moved
around
at
good
deal
around
the
far
east
and
in
the
taxable
year
of
1958,
the
account
of
the
year
involved,
he
is
claiming
deduction
for
only
ten
of
the
--
ten
months.
and
the
record,
the
--
his
itinerary
reproduced
in
the
record,
page
16
of
the
record,
if
my
addition
is
correct,
it
shows
--
is
correct,
shows
that
he
was
only
in
iwakuni
during
this
taxable
year
for
approximately
240
days
or
eight
months.
and
so
that
i
submit
that
he
is
for
the
other
two
months
approximately
of
the
deductions
claimed,
he
was
at
other
point
--
other
military
post
in
the
far
east.
and
he
testified
he
ate
almost
entirely
at
various
officers'
messes.
and
so
i
think
that
is
somewhat
analogous
to
justice
fortas'
query
as
to
what
happens
if
he
is
transferred
from
iwakuni?
mr.
john
a.
reed
he
was
out
of
united
states
a
little
over
11
months.
but
he
was
only
at
iwakuni
eight
months.
and
the
itinerary
at
page
16
shows
the
rest
of
that
term.
he
was
at
other
places
in
japan
and
philippine
islands.
he
came
back
to
california
for
two
months
in
the
middle
of
--
two
weeks
and
in
the
middle
of
it.
so
we
do
have
involved
here
to
some
extent
at
least,
say
two
months
worth
or
two
times
$65
a
month,
the
--
something
very
analogous
it
seems
to
me
to
the
revenue
ruling
571,
that's
the
ruling
reconsidered
in
the
letter
in
the
reply
brief,
something
very
analogous
to
a
naval
officer
whose
permanent
base
is
considered
to
be
let's
say
iwakuni
and
he's
considered
to
be
on
temporary
duty
afloat
if
he
will,
although
he
actually,
i
think
he
went
by
plane
from
naval
station
to
naval
station.
and
i
would
think
that
as
to
two
months
approximately,
that
even
mr.
rogovin
would
concede
that
the
deduction
is
allowed
on
any
event,
on
anything
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i'm
not
sure,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
brief
is
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
--
i
don't
know
what
their
--
had
--
what
the
government's
position
is
on
these
two
months,
mr.
justice.
but
perhaps
mr.
rogovin
will
enlighten
us.
mr.
john
a.
reed
240
days
at
iwakuni
during
the
calendar
year
58.
mr.
john
a.
reed
10
months
mr.
john
a.
reed
and
captain
stidger
testified
on
that
and
--
before
the
tax
court
that
he
did
moved
around
from
point
to
point
and
that
he
got
his
meals
wherever
he
could.
he
ordinarily
paid
for
his
meals
at
officers'
messes
as
he
said.
he
was
appearing
without
counsel
as
you
know.
mr.
john
a.
reed
iwakuni.
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
he
did
for
49
days
and
for
those
49
days
for
which
he
did
get
his
per
diem
allowance,
he
is
claiming
no
deduction.
and
that
explains
to
a
large
extent
why
he
is
only
claiming
a
deduction
for
10
months
of
the
calendar
year
58
rather
than
12
months,
the
49
days
are
--
that
deal
with
the
other
two
months
that
two
plus
10
is
12.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
think
the
other
two
weeks
are
the
two
weeks
that
he
got
back
to
california
in
mid-december.
i
don't
believe
that
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
aren't
all
controlling
in
this
case.
the
victim
from
the
opinion
of
--
majority
opinion
in
the
flowers
case
which
justice
rogovin
read
and
--
which
mr.
rogovin
read
which
appears
on
page
12
of
my
brief,
i
don't
read
it
as
contrary
to
the
position
here
where
justice
murphy
said
--
writing
for
the
court
said
that
the
exigencies
of
business
rather
than
the
personal
conveniences
and
necessities
of
the
traveler
must
be
the
motivating
factors.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
contend
that
we
have
involved
here
captain
stidger's
personal
conveniences
and
necessities.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
rather
read
that
as
very
much
to
the
same
at
least
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
that
it
all
depends
on
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
for
the
taxpayer
to
move
his
family
to
where
he
went.
and
i
certainly
think
that
in
the
flowers
case
involving
the
railroad
lawyer
down
south
it
would
have
been
quite
reasonable
for
them
--
for
him
to
move
his
family
to
his
new
post
of
duty.
so
i
don't
think
the
flowers
case
is
really
--
certainly
no
more
as
--
doesn't
support
the
government
any
more
than
the
taxpayer
if
as
much.
the
other
--
only
other
opinion
of
this
court,
the
peurifoy
case
in
1958
i
believe.
again,
i
think
the
majority
opinion
went
out
from
procedural
grounds
and
i
don't
believe
that
it's
really
took
a
position
on
the
meaning
of
home
or
the
meaning
of
temporary.
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
douglas
in
which
justices
black
and
whittaker
joined,
it
seems
to
me
to
say
substantially
what
the
majority
of
what
the
court
below
said
and
substantially
what
i
tried
to
say
in
my
brief.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
i
think
really
doesn't
throw
much
light
on
the
meaning
of
it
except
for
perhaps
that
these
--
the
63
history.
the
63
recommendation
of
the
treasury
department
to
congress
admitting
there
was
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
in
this
area
suggested
that
the
statute
be
rewritten
to
be
more
definite
and
perhaps
the
salient
feature
of
the
proposed
legislation
would
have
been
to
impose
an
absolute
limit
of
12
months
on
temporary
absence.
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
rejected
that
legislation
perhaps
raises
some
inference
that
it
didn't
want
any
limit
on
12
months.
mr.
rogovin
says
the
length
of
time
is
not
relevant
but
i
don't
think
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
ever
publicly
so
stated
in
all
the
--
all
their
publications
and
indicated
the
length
of
time
is
very
relevant
and
that
they
will
very
rarely
allow
an
absence
of
more
than
12
months
to
be
treated
as
temporary.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
basic
temporary
rule
which
is
perhaps
important
here.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
the
service's
position,
it
is
that
home
is
duly
to
be
construed
as
meaning
a
principal
place
of
business.
but
they
recognized
that
if
a
man
is
only
traveling
for
a
short
time
of
course
or
even
if
he
moves
to
a
new
place
of
business
but
is
only
going
--
only
thinks
he's
going
to
be
there
temporarily,
they
recognized
that
that
would
be
on
--
it
seems
to
me
they
recognized
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
ask
him
to
move
his
family
and
unreasonable
to
deny
him
the
deduction
for
his
meals
let's
say
as
a
temporary
place
of
employment
in
view
of
the
duplicate
expenses
he
has
--
where
he
came
from
for
his
family
and
living
expenses.
and
so
that
the
government's
temporary
rule
started
off
as
equitable,
fair,
and
sensible.
but
they
have
--
i
submit
they
have
not
followed
it
to
its
logical
conclusion.
some
were
along
the
line
and
they
decided
that
they
didn't
want
to
extend
it
very
far.
they've
been
limiting
it.
i
don't
know
why.
they've
generally
say
that
it
shouldn't
be
for
more
than
12
months.
and
somewhere
along
the
line,
i
think
they've
gone
off
the
track.
i
don't
think
that
the
period
of
time
should
be
relevant.
it
seems
to
me
even
a
man
in
the
far
east
for
two
years
or
three
years
prohibited
from
at
least
--
he's
prohibited
from
taking
his
family
and
has
duplicate
expenses
at
home
should
be
allowed
to
deduction.
mr.
rogovin
says
that
the
government
is
relying
here
not
on
the
fact
that
captain
stidger
was
overseas
for
14
or
15
months,
but
that's
alright.
but
that
fact
that
he
cut
his
business
ties
with
the
--
in
california
and
had
no
business
purpose
to
be
away
from
california,
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
the
construction
work
as
ruling
issued
by
the
service
in
1960
is
to
the
contrary.
it
says
that
they
will
no
longer
consider
whether
the
employer
had
a
business
purpose
or
the
employee
--
for
what
the
employee
did
and
they
would
--
and
they
will
admit
that
if
the
employee
--
they
will
admit
that
an
employee
may
have
a
business
purpose
for
moving
his
--
the
places
where
he
works.
and
if
there
is
an
employee's
business
purpose,
that's
enough.
well,
it
seems
to
me
captain
stidger
didn't
have
a
business
purpose
to
be
away
from
california.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
would
not
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
would
not
permit
mr.
rogovin
to
deduct
his
lunch.
i
think
perhaps
the
simplest
way
to
address
the
opinion
on
would
be
on
that
point
--
would
be
to
say
that
his
home
is
the
entire
area
including
a
big
circle
including
annandale
and
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
don't
think
so,
perhaps
this
--
perhaps
there's
a
logical,
theoretical
point
there
but
i
would
think
this
court
in
the
footnote
to
its
opinion
in
this
case
could
make
it
clear
that
it
wasn't
covering
that
situation.
i
really
think
the
best
way
to
do
that
would
be
to
draw
--
say
that
he
is
at
home
whether
he
is
in
the
place
where
he
works
or
he
lives
in
the
suburbs.
at
home,
in
other
words,
covers
in
a
radius
of
--
quite
a
large
radius.
mr.
john
a.
reed
mr.
weisman
(ph)
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
have
--
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
think
so,
i
think
so.
mr.
john
a.
reed
yes.
mr.
john
a.
reed
what
you
make
out
of
that,
i
think
a
--
i
think
part
of
the
work
here
can
be
done
by
the
ordinary
and
necessary
part
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
you
can
only
deduct
the
expenses
if
they
are
really
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
the
business.
and
i
think
that
even
though
you
have
a
child
at
home
that
you
can
take
care
of
cases
like
that
under
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
really
don't
think
that
that
should
affect
the
result
of
this
case.
now,
mr.
rogovin's
analogy
of
captain
stidger
really
having
no
business
ties
except
iwakuni
and
therefore
not
being
away
from
home.
perhaps
the
--
perhaps
an
analogy
to
be
considered
in
that
connection
is
the
case
of
the
traveling
salesman
who
is
on
the
road
virtually
all
the
time
and
really
has
no
place
of
business,
no
fixed
place
of
business.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
such
a
person
is
allowed
to
deduct
his
expenses
for
meals
other
traveling
expenses
on
the
road.
at
least
if
he
has
a
duplication
in
living
expenses,
at
least
if
he
has
a
family
and
a
home
somewhere
and
i
refer
to
several
cases
to
that
effect
are
cited
at
page
20
of
my
brief.
and
all
those
cases
indicate
that
it's
crucial
whether
or
not
there
is
a
duplication
in
expenses.
seriously
enough,
the
government
publication
of
your
income
tax
put
out
each
year
to
help
taxpayers
make
out
their
income
tax
returns
says
flatly
that
the
traveling
salesman
may
deduct
their
expenses.
doesn't
even
indicate
that
there
has
to
be
a
duplication
in
expenses
but
all
the
cases
insisted
there'd
be
a
duplication
in
expenses.
now,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
rogovin
has
argued
too
seriously
the
tax
windfall
point.
i
don't
really
think
there
is
any
tax
windfall
here
for
servicemen.
it's
true
that
the
base
--
these
basic
subsistence
allowances
as
far
as
subsistence
are
--
have
always
been
treated
as
not
subject
to
income
tax.
but
captain
stidger
got
the
same
pay
in
the
far
east
as
he
had
in
california,
he
got
the
same
subsistence
allowance
in
the
far
east
that
he
had
while
he
was
in
california.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
had
additional
expenses
in
the
far
east
for
meals.
these
10
months
of
meals
at
$65
a
month
which
he
didn't
have
back
in
california.
and
that
it's
fair
and
equitable
that
he'd
be
allowed
the
deduction.
and
it
seems
to
me
entirely
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
he
--
i
think
in
this
--
he
can
deduct
his
expenses
only
if
he's
away
from
home.
i
think
for
that
purpose,
he
can
only
have
one
home,
either
his
home
district
or
washington
--
district
of
columbia.
and
i
think
the
--
one
of
the
questions
is
where
--
which
--
in
which
of
those
two
place
does
he
do
most
of
his
work?
which
is
really
his
principal
place
of
business?
and
is
it
reasonable
--
under
my
approach
at
least,
is
it
reasonable
tax
wise
to
expect
him
to
move
his
family
to
washington,
to
the
district
of
columbia?
and
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
guess
that
his
principal
work
would
be
here,
that
he
would
be
here
most
of
the
time,
at
least
today,
and
perhaps
not
in
1920
or
1921,
when
this
statute
was
enacted.
and
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
treat
this
as
his
tax
home
because
it's
where
his
family
should
be
living,
if
they
aren't
living
here.
mr.
john
a.
reed
and
therefore,
he
should
only
be
allowed
of
his
expenses
back
in
the
home
district.
mr.
john
a.
reed
should
not
be.
mr.
john
a.
reed
i
don't
think
it's
really
relevant
to
this
case,
mr.
justice.
i
think
congress
recognized
that
the
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service
was
that
congressman
could
not
deduct
living
expenses
in
washington,
on
the
theory
that
washington
was
his
called
“home”
for
tax
purposes.
and
in
the
light
of
that
attitude
and
having
lost
at
least
one
court
decision
in
the
tax
court
on
the
point
involving
a
congressman,
the
congress
enacted
this
legislation
which
said
that
in
the
case
of
the
congressman,
washington
shall
not
be
considered
as
home
but
rather
his
home
district.
mr.
john
a.
reed
well,
i
agree
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
that
even
under
the
approach
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
that
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached
for
a
congressman
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
specific
statute.
i
think
that
it
would
have
followed
that
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
him
to
move
his
family
to
washington.
just
as
in
the
flowers
case,
the
railroad
lawyer
should
have
moved
his
family.
and
the
--
so
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
get
the
same
result
without
specific
legislation
for
the
congressman
either
under
the
government
approach
in
this
case
or
under
the
approach
of
the
court
below
in
this
case.
so
i
don't
really
think
that
what
congress
did
in
1952
is
very
prudent.
mr.
john
a.
reed
yes.
well,
i
would
say
first
that
the
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
bercaw
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
this
case.
that
involved
a
man
who
lived
on
a
farm
in
virginia
and
who
would
--
who
was
just
enlisted
in
the
army
and
was
assigned
to
duty
in
somewhere
in
maryland.
and
he
didn't
see
fit
to
move
his
family
from
virginia
to
maryland.
now
true,
it
was
--
there
was
something
said
about
--
sort
of
a
shortage
of
-
war
time
shortage
of
housing
around
the
base
in
maryland.
but
certainly,
he
could
have
move
closer
to
his
base
than
his
farm.
and
i
don't
think
that
in
that
case,
the
deduction
should
have
been
allowed.
i
don't
think
the
expenses
were
ordinary
and
necessary.
i
think
on
the
balance
in
the
aggregate,
the
family
has
a
unit
where
undoubtedly
better
off
living
with
the
rest
of
the
family
living
on
the
farm
in
virginia,
than
they
would
have
been
regardless
of
the
tax
deduction
in
that
consequences,
if
they
had
moved
the
family,
say
somewhere
between
washington
and
this
army
post
in
maryland.
so
i
don't
think
that
that
was
a
clean
cut
decision
at
all.
and
i
disagree
with
mr.
rogovin
when
he
says
the
1955
ruling
went
back
before
that.
i
think
it
was
first
announced
in
1955.
i
was
thinking
now
of
the
part
of
the
ruling
that
says
that
officers
on
permanent
duty
abroad
may
not
--
are
not
entitled
to
any
tax
deduction
even
though
it's
impossible
for
them
to
take
their
families
with
them.
i
find
nothing
before
1955
announcing
that.
and
indeed,
very
little
reference
to
it
after
1955
in
the
books.
in
fact
it's
significant
that
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
i
reproduced
some
excerpts
from
a
pamphlet
distributed
by
the
navy,
to
servicemen
which
does
not
reproduce
--
does
not
take
that
approach
at
all.
it
simply
says
that
they
cannot
deduct
the
expenses
overseas
for
an
indefinite
period.
and
it's
interesting
to
speculate
on
why
they
don't
reproduce
that
1955
ruling.
