justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
grayson,
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
your
claim
for
judicial
immunity
here
stems
from
the
absence
of
any
proof
of
corruption
or
evil
motive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
a
judge
deliberately
convicts
someone
when
he
knows
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
and
mr.
rachlin
essentially
agree
on
what
the
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
instruction
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
grayson,
just
let
me
pursue
this
other
question
just
a
moment.
let's
assume
a
judge
says,
"well,
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
decided
the
case
in
a
certain
way
and
if
that
case
applies
to
this
case
but
i
think
the
supreme
court
is
wrong
and
i
am
not
going
to
follow
the
supreme
court."
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
not
what
you're
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
might
deliberately
decide
to
try
a
man
of
constitutional
rights
but
that
wouldn't
make
him
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
judge
says
well
i
know
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
requires
equal
service
and
public
accommodation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
know
that
the
owner
of
that
the
public
accommodations
refused
service
and
the
judges,
but
i
just
don't
agree
with
that
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
he
says,
"i
know
what
the
law
is
i
just
won't
follow."
justice
byron
r.
white
here's
the
statute
i
know
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
the
judicial
immunity
pleads
the
common
law
made
an
exception
to
that
immunity
in
cases
of
the
corrupt
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
you
given
under
your
position
there
has
to
be
a
new
trial
because
there
were
errors
of
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
mrs.
grayson,
excuse
me.
justice
