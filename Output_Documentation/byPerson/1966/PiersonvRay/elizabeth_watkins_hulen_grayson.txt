ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
with
due
apology
to
my
opposing
counsel
i
don't
think
that
this
court
is
place
to
argue
disputed
questions
of
fact
as
if
they
were
being
argued
before
a
jury.
and
my
position
is
that
that's
what
opposing
counsel
has
done,
they
have
argued
their
own
testimony
or
their
own
complaint
of
allegations
in
that
complaint
without
any
record
whatsoever
to
prove
on
the
other
side
on
what
was
a
jury
issue
or
issues
in
this
case.
this
is
a
suit
in
tort
of
money
damages
in
two
counts,
based
on
the
common
law
for
false
arrest
and
second
on
the
1983.
the
issues
before
this
court,
the
jury
came
in
with
the
decision
for
the
defendant
on
disputed
questions
of
fact.
the
issues
before
this
court
are
not
rather
those
facts
were
arrived
and
decided
by
that
jury
because
it
was
a
jury
issue
and
we'll
go
back
after
this
decision
to
be
a
jury
issue
regardless
of
this
decision
it
has
to
be
based
and
go
back
for
a
trial
by
a
jury.
the
issues
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
judicial
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law
when
there
was
no
proof
whatsoever
of
any
corruption
or
any
wrong
intent
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
partial
or
limited
immunity
to
police
officers
who
act
in
good
faith
with
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact,
with
reasonable
grounds
to
prove,
to
believe
that
the
statute
was
being
violated.
that
they
were
--
that
they
had
probably
cause
which
as
i
state
is
a
question
of
fact.
i
therefore
will
only
discuss
factual
issues
and
as
to
the
limited
extent
of
pointing
out
to
your
honors
that
there
was
a
disputed
question
of
fact
on
the
right
to
the
police
officers
to
believe
that
there
was
probable
cause
of
a
breach
of
the
peace.
and
in
doing
so,
i
hope
the
court
will
recall
and
keep
in
mind
that
this
could
in
1961,
we
would
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
in
view
of
the
times.
we
must
look
at
the
facts
in
the
case
in
the
view
of
the
mood
of
the
people,
of
the
tenseness
of
the
people
in
the
city
of
jackson.
in
1961,
we
must
look
at
the
case
in
the
view
of
what
the
law
was
in
1961,
how
far
the
constitutional
standards
have
been
changed
since
then?
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
would
agree
with
counsel
that
if
there
was
proof
that
a
judge
was
actually
corrupt
that
then
a
judge
could
be
liable.
here,
that
judge
mize
submitted
it
to
the
jury,
the
judge's
immunity
along
with
the
policeman's
immunity.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
presume
that
if
you
could
prove
that
your
honor
i
believe
that
they
would
be
liable.
if
there
was
no
evidence
and
he
did
it
deliberately
with
the
intent
to
hurt
that
person.
now,
if
he
were
mistaken
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
except
to
the
extent
to
which
that
has
got
to
be
proved.
i
don't,
in
my
in
own
heart
do
not
feel
the
judges
should
be
submitted
to
suits.
it
would
have
to
be
so
clear
that
they
--
before
they
should
be
submitted
to
having
to
defend
themselves.
the
proof
would
have
to
be
so
clear.
here
judge
mize
note
that
they
--
he
would
let
it
go
to
the
jury
and
he
did
with
the
verdict
of
the
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
that
it
is
against
the
judge
and
it
should
have
been
dismissed.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
there's
no
question
of
the
instructions
not
being
tried.
if
they
have
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
now,
that
i
can't
tell
you
verbatim
(voice
overlap).
the
record
is
long
and
i
don't
recall
the
exact
wording
of
them
but
there's
been
no
question
raised
on
either
side
as
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
if
your
honor
please,
i
will
have
to
beg
off
on
that
one,
because
i
don't
recall
how
that
instruction
was
worded
or
just
how
it
was
submitted.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
but
when
--
yes
sir,
it's
in
the
record.
but
when
it
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
against
judge
spencer
and
therefore
that
he
is
sued
should
it
been
dismissed
on
the
motion
which
was
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence.
if
your
honor
please,
briefly
on
the
facts,
now
recalling
that
this
is
1961
that
the
freedom
writers
had
the
balance
in
alabama
just
two
months
before,
that
just
a
month
before
this
occurred,
there
had
been
freedom
writers
in
jackson
and
they
had
caused
almost
violence
at
that
time.
this
becoming
of
these
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
oh!
no,
sir.
i
would
say
there
was
no
liability
whatsoever,
that's
a
matter
of
judgment
and
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
law.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
not
unless
he
was
doing
it
corruptly.
the
illustration
that
mr.
rachlin
used
would
be
properly
got
together
the
night
before
and
conspired
with
one
side
and
said,
"i'm
going
to
deliberately
decide
for
your
and
throw
the
book
at
them."
now,
that
might
be
corrupt
but
not
a
judge
differing
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
by
the
other
court
do
i
think
is
corrupt.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes
-
no,
i
would
say
not.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no
sir,
i
would
say
that
that
was
his
honest
conviction
on
what
the
law
was.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
you're
getting
a
little
deep,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
a
rather
serious
question
that
has
not
presented
here
or
whatsoever.
this
statute
would
not
only
has
never
been
held
unconstitutional
yet
under
which
they
acted
under
which
they
were
asked
but
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
two
years
after
judge
spencer's
decision
affirm
similar
cases
and
made
exactly
the
same
decisions
so
you
couldn't
possibly
say
here
that
there
was
any
--
i
know
what
the
law
is.
the
law
was
valid
on
his
face
under
which
they
were
arrested.
these
policemen,
these
practitioners
in
their
garb
?-
church
garb
mixed
group
broadcast
the
fact
and
planned
deliberately
to
come
down
to
jackson,
mississippi
to
be
arrested
so
they
could
be
what
they
call
witnesses
of
incarceration
and
go
to
detroit
as
being
the
witnesses
they
came
to
be
arrested.
they
broadcast
it
over
television,
newspapers
and
what
they
were
going
to
do,
they
came
down
on
the
road
--
in
taxis,
to
the
bus
station
and
went
in.
now,
the
opposing
counsel
has
not
given
you
the
testimony
on
the
other
side.
they
went
in
and
there
is
testimony
that
30
to
40
people
followed
them
in
that
they
have
angry
expressions,
that
they
were
muttering
and
that
they
followed
them
into
the
bus
station.
this
--
this
group
of
churchmen
turned
into
the
left
and
started
towards
the
restaurant
and
two
distant
policemen
on
the
street
told
them
to
move
on.
they
turned
back
and
instead
of
moving,
blocked
the
stairway
in
the
bus
stations,
stood
in
those
narrow
halls
and
something
the
jury
didn't
mean
to
be
told
was
that
in
fact
the
bus
station
is
a
very
small
room
and
proceeded
to
recite
the
lord's
prayer.
there
was
a
crowd,
not
only
had
30
or
40
followed
them
in
but
they
had
--
there
was
crowd
in
the
station.
there
was
muttering,
mumbling,
wrongful
and
violent
gestures,
until
all
three,
mr.
ray
and
the
other
two
policemen
testified
emphatically
that
they
felt
imbalance
was
about
to
ensue
and
that
it
would
ensue
if
they
did
not
arrest
them
and
this
is
not
a
criminal
case
on
which
the
criminal
convictions
would
be
involved
which
would
be
decided
on
different
principles
of
law
and
different
faces
of
proof
why
you'd
have
to
prove
guilt
of
such
a
crime
of
breach
of
the
peace
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
a
case
where
the
only
proof
necessary
is,
don't
need
those
simple
policemen
standing
there
on
that
day
without
going
on
believing
and
assuming
their
own
testimony
to
be
true
for
the
matter
of
this
argument.
now,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
balance
was
going
to
ensue.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
to
find
that
in
my
brief.
i
report
to
you
there
are
long
group
of
directives
on
levels
which
were
written
to
the
whole
group
before
they
came
in
which
they
were
told
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
how
they
were
going
to
do
it.
and
those
letters
go
from
page
224
on
for
the
next
50
pages
these
original
levels
to
this
placement
to
which
they
said
that
they
were
planning
which
one
should
go
to
jail.
the
place
is
everything
will
consign
15
to
jail
and
let
the
rest
go
on
and
be
with
until
about
(inaudible)
detroit
what
happen.
then
in
another
place,
another
letter
said
we
think
now
as
that
better
part
or
valid
to
consign
only
a
dozen
of
them
to
jail.
and
then
they
told
in
these
letters
you
must
stay
that
long
enough
without
getting
bailed
because
she
wouldn't
be
a
proper
witness
of
incarceration
if
you
didn't
stay
there
a
little
while
and
it
run
from
about
these
224
in
the
record.
it
came
from
these
letters.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
there's
no
question
raised
for
what
complaint
stated
the
cause
of
action.
he
went
to
trial
on
the
case
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
no
question
was
raised
about
it
at
the
moment.
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
testimony
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
to
the
judge
filed
which
judge
mize
overruled
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
should
have
been
sustained
because
no
evidence.
but
there
was
no
objection
made
to
the
complaint
on
no
objection
made
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir,
they
are
not
raised.
but
we
did
not
raise
the
point
that
the
complaint.
of
course,
they
sued
them
all
jointly
in
the
beginning
with
the
judge
couldn't
have
a
separate
motion
i
guess
that
there
as
a
complaint
as
to
him
but
as
i
recall
no
motions
on
the
section
was
filed.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
does.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
there
was
no
motion
filed
until
after
the
conclusion
of
evidence
to
dismiss
and
execute
the
judge.
and
may
i
now
state
for
the
court
when
they
went
before
the
judge.
here
was
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute
unlike
the
south
carolina
statute,
unlike
the
louisiana
statute,
not
vague
and
indefinite
valid
on
its
face,
at
that
time,
the
law
was
final
and
cantwell
i
believe
it
was,
cantwell.
those
were
the
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
upheld
constitution
that
final
statute
was
identical
with
mississippi
statute.
it
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
it
never
been
held
unconstitutional
and
has
never
to
this
date
been
held
unconstitutional
although
they
were
--
insist
on
referring
to
it
as
an
unconstitutional
statute.
it
has
never
--
it
may
have
been
at
times
unconstitutionally
enforced
but
never
unconstitutional
per
se.
they
were
brought
before
judge
benson
and
he
is
an
ex-official
justice
of
peace
in
municipal
criminal
court,
a
small
city
court,
criminal
court.
he
is
part
time.
he
was
not
brilliantly
trained
lawyer.
if
he
was
as
i
say
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
two
years
later
upheld
the
statute
and
upheld
convictions
under
them.
the
cases
came
to
trial,
all
of
these
petitioners
were
represented
by
two
attorneys,
and
i
think
mr.
rachlin
was
one
of
them.
they
have
attorneys
in
court.
they
could
have
had
a
jury
trial.
they
did
not
request
it.
they
did
not
testify
their
own
behalf.
the
policeman
testified
and
these
petitioners
said,
"what
do
you
expect
the
judge
to
do?
with
the
valid
statute,
the
policeman
saying
it
was
misstated
and
they
--
the
defendants
not
saying
a
word
it
painfully
demonstrate
that
time.
they
wanted
to
be
witnesses
of
incarceration,
and
that
they
let
it
off
at
that
moment
they
wouldn't
be
it.
then
they
went
on
later
to
the
appeal
to
judge
moore
and
i
think
that
differ
with
opposing
counsel,
the
fact
that
the
judge
said
that
there
was
no
evidence.
that
only
thing
in
this
record
is
the
record
of
dismissal
with
no
ground
whatsoever
to
dismiss
because
it
could
have
been
dismissed
on
the
interpretation
of
the
law.
it
could
have
been
dismissed
on
insufficient
evidence
or
as
the
petitioners
themselves
complained
in
their
letters.
they
resented
the
fact
that
judge
moore
dismissed
it
because
they
were
episcopal
preachers.
they
did
not
want
to
dismiss
on
that
ground.
so
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
acquitted
later
is
apparent
in
what
they
are
saying
shows
corruption
on
the
part
of
our
judge
--
on
the
part
of
judge
spencer.
just
briefly
further
on
the
immunity
of
judges
in
this
tenney
versus
brandhove
this
court
went
thoroughly
into
the
legislative
history
on
1983
went
out
there
and
learnedly
into
it
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
1983
to
show
any
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
change
the
common
law
liability
of
the
tort
to
get
it
--
to
make
it
anything
except
a
common
law
tort.
i
would
not
purport
to
attempt
to
go
into
the
history
of
that
congressional
act
in
1871
to
the
extent
that
tenney
versus
brandhove
did
but
the
basis
or
the
end
of
that
testimony,
of
their
position
as
to
the
legislative
history
was
that
there
was
no
intent
to
change
common
law
tort
liability.
and
of
course
the
common
law
tort
liability
of
legislator
this
was
immunity
just
as
strong
as
the
common
law
of
tort
immunity,
liability
immunity
of
judges.
that
goes
back
to
bradley
versus
fisher
in
80
u.s.
335
where
it
is
of
a
remarkable
position
on
the
necessity
power,
the
reason
power,
and
the
common
law
immunity
of
judges.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
recall
that
it
had
that
it
was
a
constitutional
question.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
it
was
a
common
law
immunity.
that's
why
i
tell
you
the
tenney
versus
brandhove
goes
back
to
the
common
law
immunity
of
legislators.
the
later
cases
in
every
cases
in
every
circuit
is
based
on
it
except
its
knowing
through
the
fifth
circuit
have
held
that
the
same
reasoning
shows
that
the
legislator's
intent
was
not
to
change
common
law
immunity
of
judges
and
there's
no
reason
why
it
should
that
the
intent
was
not
to
change
the
common
law
tort
liability.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
had
no
such
purpose.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
he
has
picked
--
he
has
picked
scattered
passages
from
the
congressional
record.
i
say
that
if
tenney
versus
brandhove
went
to
it
thoroughly
and
they
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
to
indicate
any
intent
to
change
the
common
law
that
the
legislative
common
law
immunity
was
old,
was
such
a
judicial
common
immunity
and
that's
the
reason
i
mentioned
bradley
versus
bishop
because
it
is
the
leading
case
in
the
common
law
immunity
of
the
judges.
since
then
every
circuit
that
has
passed
on
it
the
first,
the
second,
the
third,
the
fifth,
sixth,
the
seventh
and
eight
have
all
held
that
tenney
versus
brandhove
applies
to
judges.
and
we
don't
need
to
argue
here
whether
it
needs
to
be
complete
absolute
immunity
are
just
partial
limited
immunity
because
there
was
no
testimony
in
this
record
whatsoever
that
the
judges
ever
heard
of
these
people
before
they
just
appeared
in
this
court
that
he
had
no
conversation
of
any
of
the
policemen
about
him
or
anybody
about
him
that
he
had
any
connection
or
any
intent
whatsoever,
any
corrupt
intent
on
his
part.
so
we
don't
even
need
absolute
immunity
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
hurry
on
to
the
immunity
of
policeman
because
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
as
i
recall,
the
case
did
not
discussed
the
issue
that
it
was
actual
corruption.
now,
when
i
say
admitted
that
it
was
actual
corruption,
i
mean
actual.
i
don't
think
that
that
into
that
case
anymore
than
it
does
here.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
if
your
honor
please,
i
read
tenney
versus
brandhove
as
merely
saying
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
common
law.
now,
if
you
go
back
to
the
common
law
of
the
judicial
immunity
don't
you
find
that
exception
if
there's
actual
corruption?
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
think
that
that
would
go
back
to
the
common
law
and
all
tenney
versus
brandhove
was
saying
was
that
the
legislative
congress
intended
to
change
the
common
law.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
the
test
as
what
the
construction
of
the
common
law
was.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
think
that
it
did.
i
have
never
felt
that
there
was
any
thought
of
any
corruption
of
this
case
and
have
not
carefully
gone
and
read
that
question
because
there's
never
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
that
--
because
you
will
know
better
than
i
do.
i
don't
recall
that
it
was
discussed
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
that's
why
my
impression
was
that
it
was
not
involved
and
it
was
not
discussed
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
absolutely.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
and
even
though
corruption.
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
court
if
they
feel
that
way.
i
feel
--
never
felt
my
finding
of
judge
spencer.
i
mean
i
just
have
always
thought
that
if
there
was
actual
corruption
that
the
immunity
might
not
go
that
far.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
i
would
think
that
any
immunity
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
in
the
what?
i
didn't
understand
you
mr.
justice.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
leaving
that
way.
but
i
do
say
that
all
the
question
of
corruptness
is
decide
the
issue
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
we
don't
have
to
go
whether
they
have
actually
corrupt,
actual
corrupt
evidence
because
there
was
none.
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
anything
except
the
judge
giving
his
best
judgment
which
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
immunity
of
the
police
officers
because
if
there
is
anyone
that
i
feel
have
stand
here
that
needs
representation
and
that
i
would
like
to
do
my
best
to
represent,
it
is
the
policeman
on
these
trouble
times.
when
he
doesn't
know
what
to
do,
he
has
to
make
snap
decisions.
he
has
no
lawyer
running
along
his
side
to
tell
him
what
the
law
is
and
what
the
facts
are
whether
he's
right.
he
can't
remember
afterwards,
take
all
his
could
in
this
past
summer
then
thousands
of
arrests
where
a
policeman
have
arrested
people
where
they
have
thought
at
the
time
that
they
were
justified.
suppose
one
of
those
men
three
years
later
say
well
i
was
acquitted.
the
policeman
doesn't
remember
he
hasn't
got
down
witnesses
and
get
names,
get
ready
for
a
lawsuit
three
or
four
years
from
now.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
fine
points
of
the
law.
he
has
got
to
use
his
best
judgment
in
whether
or
not
there
is
violence
about
to
occur.
and
that
is
what
we
submit.
that
is
the
common
law
immunity
of
police
officers,
it
just
as
goes
as
far
back
as
the
immunity
of
judges.
if
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
there's
probable
cause
about
a
balance,
then
under
the
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
they
have
a
right
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
in
other
words,
probable
cause
is
a
complete
defense
to
the
police
officers
who
are
sued
for
damages
at
common
law.
there
is
no
change
under
the
1983
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
false
arrest,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
plainly
monroe
versus
pape
does
not
say
--
it
doesn't
say
to
the
contrary.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
because
that
was
a
search
and
seizure
case
and
under
the
search
and
seizure
case
there
is
no
defense
of
probable
cause.
they
searched
the
man's
house
not
in
good
faith
and
also
search
it
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
without
a
warrant
and
for
false
imprisonment
case,
probable
cause
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
is
a
complete
defense.
in
illegal
search
without
a
prior
arrest,
probable
cause
is
no
defense
whatsoever.
when
that
case
was
remanded
it
was
only
before
this
court
because
the
complaint
had
been
dismissed
does
not
state
in
the
cause
of
action
and
this
court
merely
said
that
it's
stated
a
cause
of
action
and
remanded
it
which
i
don't
make
any
complaint
because
it
came
into
nearer
to
state
cause
of
action
than
that
one
--
complete
the
state
of
the
cause
of
action
than
that
one
did.
this
cause
remanded
it
and
they
resulted
in
the
district
court
in
the
jury
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
and
then
the
defendants
of
motion
judgments
notwithstanding
brought
up
that
the
probable
cause
for
the
search
and
the
district
court
dismissed
it
and
said
that
probable
cause
is
no
defense
whatsoever
to
an
illegal
search
because
of
the
constitutional
provision
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
defense
whatsoever
to
that.
there
has
been
no
change
in
that
common
law
rule
any
more
than
immunity
of
judges
in
the
--
under
1983.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
this
is
the
point
under
which
we
petition
cross-appeal,
cross-certiorari
on
the
ground
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
probable
cause
was
a
defense
to
the
common
law
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
not
to
1983.
in
the
opinion,
they
merely
said
that
the
rule
may
be
otherwise
under
1983
and
cited
no
case
which
is
held
that
is
different
under
1983
and
yet
held
that
under
1983
probable
cause
was
no
defense
and
because
if
this
when
this
case
goes
back
we
should
have
it
a
right
to
submit
in
that
jury
again
is
or
whether
or
not
those
police
officers
because
the
common
law
controls
and
still
is
effective
just
as
much
as
to
police
officers
under
1983
that
would
be
to
judicial
officers.
the
monroe
said
that
the
1983
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
common
law
tort
liability.
it
has
not
in
any
way
changed
the
common
law
of
what
the
tort
is
that
they
could
be
sued
for
and
in
this
instance
it
was
false
imprisonment.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
in
any
doubt
in
its
thorough
brief
of
false
imprisonment
is
a
complete
defense
of
the
common
law
i
mean
that
the
probable
cause
is
a
complete
defense
at
the
common
law.
all
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
to
the
court
there
decision
was
that
inherent
in
the
monroe
holding
if
the
principle
was
in
good
faith
and
relied
on
the
state
statute
subsequently
declared
invalid
are
not
valid
as
the
defenses.
i
do
not
have
time
to
point
out
your
honor
that
the
section
breach
of
peace
statute
has
never
been
held
unconstitutional.
now,
this
court
at
the
time
this
occurred,
the
rule
was
then
final
and
which
was
held
constitutional.
in
thomas
versus
state
two
years
after
this
occurrence,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
held
it
valid.
this
is
unlike
edwards
versus
south
carolina
or
cox
versus
louisiana
where
the
court
held
that
if
the
statute
was
vague
because
it
said
that
breach
of
the
peace
could
include
such
things
as
this
rest
or
this
qua
of
vague
general
words.
in
mississippi
and
thomas
versus
state
they
held
it
had,
it
meant
violence
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
required
violence.
and
that's
what
the
proof
of
this
case
showed
that
the
police
officers
believe
but
even
if
this
court
should
now
hold
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
that
violence
was
imminent.
our
statute
permits
a
cause
--
a
breach
of
the
peace.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
under
such
circumstances,
now
the
breach
of
the
peace
are
valid
as
our
court
interpreted
it
can
maybe
can
occur
is
the
language
of
the
statute
but
even
if
this
court
should
now
six
years
later
or
five
years
later
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional,
which
i
don't
think
it
will
that's
not
even
pled,
they
didn't
that
it's
unconstitutional
statute.
the
rule
in
mississippi
and
the
rule
of
most
places
is
that
unconstitutional
law
is
a
nullity
cannot
be
applied
to
work
hardship
to
oppose
liability
on
a
public
officer
who
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
was
acting
in
good
faith
in
reliance
on
the
validity
of
the
statute
before
any
court
has
decided
it
in
valid.
mississippi
follows
that
rule.
most
of
the
fact
if
not
all
of
the
rules
note
that
as
an
exception
that
a
public
officer
cannot
be
held.
there's
a
difference
between
the
ham
case
where
you
say
a
conviction
can
be
handed
down
and
the
--
the
opposite
here
where
you
can't
impose
liability
on
someone
which
were
illegal
when
they
did
it
and
then
come
along
six
years
later,
saying
we're
going
to
make
that,
that
there
was
constitutional
statute
then
but
we're
going
to
make
it
illegal
now.
i
do
not
have
time
to
go
into
the
point
on
petition
that
planned
that
that
is
not
just
a
defense,
the
planning
to
come
and
not
just
to
anticipate
and
they
might
be
arrested
but
planning
to
come.
that
is
not
a
mere
defense
like
assumption
of
written
(inaudible)
opposing
counsel
would
have
you
believe,
it's
inherent
in
the
talk
itself
there
is
no
false
imprisonment
if
there
was
consent
just
as
there
no
(inaudible)
if
there
was
consent,
there's
no
assault
if
there's
consent.
there
are
certain
torts
that
whenever
there
is
consent,
there
are
no
tort
to
begin
with
so
it's
different
from
a
defense.
i
would
like
to
urge--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
urge
the
court
to
give
this
case
serious
consideration
because
of
its
importance
in
the
future
litigation
of
the
thousands
of
cases
in
the
federal
court
and
on
the
effect,
it
will
have
on
the
police
force
all
over
the
country
if
they
are
subject
to
sue
and
subject
to
money
damages
with
little
pay
in
families
and
they
are
subject
upon
to
suits
for
damages.
it
can
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
protection
of
the
public.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
oh
no
sir.
i
said,
our
position
is
that
there
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes
sir
and
i
think
they
thoroughly
misunderstood
it.
it
was
a
search
and
seizure
case
by
probable
cause
had
no
--
there's
no
defense
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
they
say
it's
inherent
in
monroe
versus
pape
that
the
good
faith
under
the
state's
statute
come
on
excess
under
1983
only
was
immaterial.
monroe
versus
pape
didn't
even
deal
with
acting
under
state
statute
in
good
faith
believing
it
was
to
be
valid.
there
they
were
acting
without
any
--
on
contrary
to
the
state
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
misapplied.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
acting
under
a
state
statute
which
would
later
declare
unconstitutional.
they
were
acting
without
statute
because
contrary
to
the
state
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
mr.
black.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
the
state
is
not
here.
you
mean
the
petitioner,
the
one
error
of
the
court
below
in
saying
that
the
probable
cause
is
not
a
defense
to
false
imprisonment
under
1983.
they
said
it
was
a
defense
under
the
common
law.
but
they
held
it
was
not
a
defense
under
1983
with
we
submit
with
no
justification
presented.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
we
submit
it
to
a
new
jury.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
on
the
new
trial.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
we
in
our
brief
we
have
said
that
felt
the
fifth
circuit
differed
on
error
erred
in
saying
that
those
were
errors
in
the
evidence
but
i
have
not
have
time
to
argue.
they
were
just
small
matters
of
evidence.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
with
due
apology
to
my
opposing
counsel
i
don't
think
that
this
court
is
place
to
argue
disputed
questions
of
fact
as
if
they
were
being
argued
before
a
jury.
and
my
position
is
that
that's
what
opposing
counsel
has
done,
they
have
argued
their
own
testimony
or
their
own
complaint
of
allegations
in
that
complaint
without
any
record
whatsoever
to
prove
on
the
other
side
on
what
was
a
jury
issue
or
issues
in
this
case.
this
is
a
suit
in
tort
of
money
damages
in
two
counts,
based
on
the
common
law
for
false
arrest
and
second
on
the
1983.
the
issues
before
this
court,
the
jury
came
in
with
the
decision
for
the
defendant
on
disputed
questions
of
fact.
the
issues
before
this
court
are
not
rather
those
facts
were
arrived
and
decided
by
that
jury
because
it
was
a
jury
issue
and
we'll
go
back
after
this
decision
to
be
a
jury
issue
regardless
of
this
decision
it
has
to
be
based
and
go
back
for
a
trial
by
a
jury.
the
issues
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
judicial
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law
when
there
was
no
proof
whatsoever
of
any
corruption
or
any
wrong
intent
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
partial
or
limited
immunity
to
police
officers
who
act
in
good
faith
with
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact,
with
reasonable
grounds
to
prove,
to
believe
that
the
statute
was
being
violated.
that
they
were
--
that
they
had
probably
cause
which
as
i
state
is
a
question
of
fact.
i
therefore
will
only
discuss
factual
issues
and
as
to
the
limited
extent
of
pointing
out
to
your
honors
that
there
was
a
disputed
question
of
fact
on
the
right
to
the
police
officers
to
believe
that
there
was
probable
cause
of
a
breach
of
the
peace.
and
in
doing
so,
i
hope
the
court
will
recall
and
keep
in
mind
that
this
could
in
1961,
we
would
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
in
view
of
the
times.
we
must
look
at
the
facts
in
the
case
in
the
view
of
the
mood
of
the
people,
of
the
tenseness
of
the
people
in
the
city
of
jackson.
in
1961,
we
must
look
at
the
case
in
the
view
of
what
the
law
was
in
1961,
how
far
the
constitutional
standards
have
been
changed
since
then?
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
would
agree
with
counsel
that
if
there
was
proof
that
a
judge
was
actually
corrupt
that
then
a
judge
could
be
liable.
here,
that
judge
mize
submitted
it
to
the
jury,
the
judge's
immunity
along
with
the
policeman's
immunity.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
presume
that
if
you
could
prove
that
your
honor
i
believe
that
they
would
be
liable.
if
there
was
no
evidence
and
he
did
it
deliberately
with
the
intent
to
hurt
that
person.
now,
if
he
were
mistaken
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
except
to
the
extent
to
which
that
has
got
to
be
proved.
i
don't,
in
my
in
own
heart
do
not
feel
the
judges
should
be
submitted
to
suits.
it
would
have
to
be
so
clear
that
they
--
before
they
should
be
submitted
to
having
to
defend
themselves.
the
proof
would
have
to
be
so
clear.
here
judge
mize
note
that
they
--
he
would
let
it
go
to
the
jury
and
he
did
with
the
verdict
of
the
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
that
it
is
against
the
judge
and
it
should
have
been
dismissed.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
there's
no
question
of
the
instructions
not
being
tried.
if
they
have
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
now,
that
i
can't
tell
you
verbatim
(voice
overlap).
the
record
is
long
and
i
don't
recall
the
exact
wording
of
them
but
there's
been
no
question
raised
on
either
side
as
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
if
your
honor
please,
i
will
have
to
beg
off
on
that
one,
because
i
don't
recall
how
that
instruction
was
worded
or
just
how
it
was
submitted.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
but
when
--
yes
sir,
it's
in
the
record.
but
when
it
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
against
judge
spencer
and
therefore
that
he
is
sued
should
it
been
dismissed
on
the
motion
which
was
made
after
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence.
if
your
honor
please,
briefly
on
the
facts,
now
recalling
that
this
is
1961
that
the
freedom
writers
had
the
balance
in
alabama
just
two
months
before,
that
just
a
month
before
this
occurred,
there
had
been
freedom
writers
in
jackson
and
they
had
caused
almost
violence
at
that
time.
this
becoming
of
these
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
oh!
no,
sir.
i
would
say
there
was
no
liability
whatsoever,
that's
a
matter
of
judgment
and
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
law.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
not
unless
he
was
doing
it
corruptly.
the
illustration
that
mr.
rachlin
used
would
be
properly
got
together
the
night
before
and
conspired
with
one
side
and
said,
"i'm
going
to
deliberately
decide
for
your
and
throw
the
book
at
them."
now,
that
might
be
corrupt
but
not
a
judge
differing
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
by
the
other
court
do
i
think
is
corrupt.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes
-
no,
i
would
say
not.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no
sir,
i
would
say
that
that
was
his
honest
conviction
on
what
the
law
was.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
you're
getting
a
little
deep,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
a
rather
serious
question
that
has
not
presented
here
or
whatsoever.
this
statute
would
not
only
has
never
been
held
unconstitutional
yet
under
which
they
acted
under
which
they
were
asked
but
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
two
years
after
judge
spencer's
decision
affirm
similar
cases
and
made
exactly
the
same
decisions
so
you
couldn't
possibly
say
here
that
there
was
any
--
i
know
what
the
law
is.
the
law
was
valid
on
his
face
under
which
they
were
arrested.
these
policemen,
these
practitioners
in
their
garb
?-
church
garb
mixed
group
broadcast
the
fact
and
planned
deliberately
to
come
down
to
jackson,
mississippi
to
be
arrested
so
they
could
be
what
they
call
witnesses
of
incarceration
and
go
to
detroit
as
being
the
witnesses
they
came
to
be
arrested.
they
broadcast
it
over
television,
newspapers
and
what
they
were
going
to
do,
they
came
down
on
the
road
--
in
taxis,
to
the
bus
station
and
went
in.
now,
the
opposing
counsel
has
not
given
you
the
testimony
on
the
other
side.
they
went
in
and
there
is
testimony
that
30
to
40
people
followed
them
in
that
they
have
angry
expressions,
that
they
were
muttering
and
that
they
followed
them
into
the
bus
station.
this
--
this
group
of
churchmen
turned
into
the
left
and
started
towards
the
restaurant
and
two
distant
policemen
on
the
street
told
them
to
move
on.
they
turned
back
and
instead
of
moving,
blocked
the
stairway
in
the
bus
stations,
stood
in
those
narrow
halls
and
something
the
jury
didn't
mean
to
be
told
was
that
in
fact
the
bus
station
is
a
very
small
room
and
proceeded
to
recite
the
lord's
prayer.
there
was
a
crowd,
not
only
had
30
or
40
followed
them
in
but
they
had
--
there
was
crowd
in
the
station.
there
was
muttering,
mumbling,
wrongful
and
violent
gestures,
until
all
three,
mr.
ray
and
the
other
two
policemen
testified
emphatically
that
they
felt
imbalance
was
about
to
ensue
and
that
it
would
ensue
if
they
did
not
arrest
them
and
this
is
not
a
criminal
case
on
which
the
criminal
convictions
would
be
involved
which
would
be
decided
on
different
principles
of
law
and
different
faces
of
proof
why
you'd
have
to
prove
guilt
of
such
a
crime
of
breach
of
the
peace
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
this
is
a
case
where
the
only
proof
necessary
is,
don't
need
those
simple
policemen
standing
there
on
that
day
without
going
on
believing
and
assuming
their
own
testimony
to
be
true
for
the
matter
of
this
argument.
now,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
balance
was
going
to
ensue.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
to
find
that
in
my
brief.
i
report
to
you
there
are
long
group
of
directives
on
levels
which
were
written
to
the
whole
group
before
they
came
in
which
they
were
told
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
how
they
were
going
to
do
it.
and
those
letters
go
from
page
224
on
for
the
next
50
pages
these
original
levels
to
this
placement
to
which
they
said
that
they
were
planning
which
one
should
go
to
jail.
the
place
is
everything
will
consign
15
to
jail
and
let
the
rest
go
on
and
be
with
until
about
(inaudible)
detroit
what
happen.
then
in
another
place,
another
letter
said
we
think
now
as
that
better
part
or
valid
to
consign
only
a
dozen
of
them
to
jail.
and
then
they
told
in
these
letters
you
must
stay
that
long
enough
without
getting
bailed
because
she
wouldn't
be
a
proper
witness
of
incarceration
if
you
didn't
stay
there
a
little
while
and
it
run
from
about
these
224
in
the
record.
it
came
from
these
letters.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
there's
no
question
raised
for
what
complaint
stated
the
cause
of
action.
he
went
to
trial
on
the
case
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
no
question
was
raised
about
it
at
the
moment.
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
testimony
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
to
the
judge
filed
which
judge
mize
overruled
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
should
have
been
sustained
because
no
evidence.
but
there
was
no
objection
made
to
the
complaint
on
no
objection
made
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir,
they
are
not
raised.
but
we
did
not
raise
the
point
that
the
complaint.
of
course,
they
sued
them
all
jointly
in
the
beginning
with
the
judge
couldn't
have
a
separate
motion
i
guess
that
there
as
a
complaint
as
to
him
but
as
i
recall
no
motions
on
the
section
was
filed.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
does.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
there
was
no
motion
filed
until
after
the
conclusion
of
evidence
to
dismiss
and
execute
the
judge.
and
may
i
now
state
for
the
court
when
they
went
before
the
judge.
here
was
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute
unlike
the
south
carolina
statute,
unlike
the
louisiana
statute,
not
vague
and
indefinite
valid
on
its
face,
at
that
time,
the
law
was
final
and
cantwell
i
believe
it
was,
cantwell.
those
were
the
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
upheld
constitution
that
final
statute
was
identical
with
mississippi
statute.
it
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
it
never
been
held
unconstitutional
and
has
never
to
this
date
been
held
unconstitutional
although
they
were
--
insist
on
referring
to
it
as
an
unconstitutional
statute.
it
has
never
--
it
may
have
been
at
times
unconstitutionally
enforced
but
never
unconstitutional
per
se.
they
were
brought
before
judge
benson
and
he
is
an
ex-official
justice
of
peace
in
municipal
criminal
court,
a
small
city
court,
criminal
court.
he
is
part
time.
he
was
not
brilliantly
trained
lawyer.
if
he
was
as
i
say
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
two
years
later
upheld
the
statute
and
upheld
convictions
under
them.
the
cases
came
to
trial,
all
of
these
petitioners
were
represented
by
two
attorneys,
and
i
think
mr.
rachlin
was
one
of
them.
they
have
attorneys
in
court.
they
could
have
had
a
jury
trial.
they
did
not
request
it.
they
did
not
testify
their
own
behalf.
the
policeman
testified
and
these
petitioners
said,
"what
do
you
expect
the
judge
to
do?
with
the
valid
statute,
the
policeman
saying
it
was
misstated
and
they
--
the
defendants
not
saying
a
word
it
painfully
demonstrate
that
time.
they
wanted
to
be
witnesses
of
incarceration,
and
that
they
let
it
off
at
that
moment
they
wouldn't
be
it.
then
they
went
on
later
to
the
appeal
to
judge
moore
and
i
think
that
differ
with
opposing
counsel,
the
fact
that
the
judge
said
that
there
was
no
evidence.
that
only
thing
in
this
record
is
the
record
of
dismissal
with
no
ground
whatsoever
to
dismiss
because
it
could
have
been
dismissed
on
the
interpretation
of
the
law.
it
could
have
been
dismissed
on
insufficient
evidence
or
as
the
petitioners
themselves
complained
in
their
letters.
they
resented
the
fact
that
judge
moore
dismissed
it
because
they
were
episcopal
preachers.
they
did
not
want
to
dismiss
on
that
ground.
so
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
acquitted
later
is
apparent
in
what
they
are
saying
shows
corruption
on
the
part
of
our
judge
--
on
the
part
of
judge
spencer.
just
briefly
further
on
the
immunity
of
judges
in
this
tenney
versus
brandhove
this
court
went
thoroughly
into
the
legislative
history
on
1983
went
out
there
and
learnedly
into
it
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
1983
to
show
any
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
change
the
common
law
liability
of
the
tort
to
get
it
--
to
make
it
anything
except
a
common
law
tort.
i
would
not
purport
to
attempt
to
go
into
the
history
of
that
congressional
act
in
1871
to
the
extent
that
tenney
versus
brandhove
did
but
the
basis
or
the
end
of
that
testimony,
of
their
position
as
to
the
legislative
history
was
that
there
was
no
intent
to
change
common
law
tort
liability.
and
of
course
the
common
law
tort
liability
of
legislator
this
was
immunity
just
as
strong
as
the
common
law
of
tort
immunity,
liability
immunity
of
judges.
that
goes
back
to
bradley
versus
fisher
in
80
u.s.
335
where
it
is
of
a
remarkable
position
on
the
necessity
power,
the
reason
power,
and
the
common
law
immunity
of
judges.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
recall
that
it
had
that
it
was
a
constitutional
question.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
it
was
a
common
law
immunity.
that's
why
i
tell
you
the
tenney
versus
brandhove
goes
back
to
the
common
law
immunity
of
legislators.
the
later
cases
in
every
cases
in
every
circuit
is
based
on
it
except
its
knowing
through
the
fifth
circuit
have
held
that
the
same
reasoning
shows
that
the
legislator's
intent
was
not
to
change
common
law
immunity
of
judges
and
there's
no
reason
why
it
should
that
the
intent
was
not
to
change
the
common
law
tort
liability.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
had
no
such
purpose.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
he
has
picked
--
he
has
picked
scattered
passages
from
the
congressional
record.
i
say
that
if
tenney
versus
brandhove
went
to
it
thoroughly
and
they
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
to
indicate
any
intent
to
change
the
common
law
that
the
legislative
common
law
immunity
was
old,
was
such
a
judicial
common
immunity
and
that's
the
reason
i
mentioned
bradley
versus
bishop
because
it
is
the
leading
case
in
the
common
law
immunity
of
the
judges.
since
then
every
circuit
that
has
passed
on
it
the
first,
the
second,
the
third,
the
fifth,
sixth,
the
seventh
and
eight
have
all
held
that
tenney
versus
brandhove
applies
to
judges.
and
we
don't
need
to
argue
here
whether
it
needs
to
be
complete
absolute
immunity
are
just
partial
limited
immunity
because
there
was
no
testimony
in
this
record
whatsoever
that
the
judges
ever
heard
of
these
people
before
they
just
appeared
in
this
court
that
he
had
no
conversation
of
any
of
the
policemen
about
him
or
anybody
about
him
that
he
had
any
connection
or
any
intent
whatsoever,
any
corrupt
intent
on
his
part.
so
we
don't
even
need
absolute
immunity
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
hurry
on
to
the
immunity
of
policeman
because
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
as
i
recall,
the
case
did
not
discussed
the
issue
that
it
was
actual
corruption.
now,
when
i
say
admitted
that
it
was
actual
corruption,
i
mean
actual.
i
don't
think
that
that
into
that
case
anymore
than
it
does
here.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
if
your
honor
please,
i
read
tenney
versus
brandhove
as
merely
saying
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
common
law.
now,
if
you
go
back
to
the
common
law
of
the
judicial
immunity
don't
you
find
that
exception
if
there's
actual
corruption?
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
think
that
that
would
go
back
to
the
common
law
and
all
tenney
versus
brandhove
was
saying
was
that
the
legislative
congress
intended
to
change
the
common
law.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
the
test
as
what
the
construction
of
the
common
law
was.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
think
that
it
did.
i
have
never
felt
that
there
was
any
thought
of
any
corruption
of
this
case
and
have
not
carefully
gone
and
read
that
question
because
there's
never
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
that
--
because
you
will
know
better
than
i
do.
i
don't
recall
that
it
was
discussed
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
that's
why
my
impression
was
that
it
was
not
involved
and
it
was
not
discussed
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
absolutely.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
and
even
though
corruption.
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
court
if
they
feel
that
way.
i
feel
--
never
felt
my
finding
of
judge
spencer.
i
mean
i
just
have
always
thought
that
if
there
was
actual
corruption
that
the
immunity
might
not
go
that
far.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
no,
sir.
i
would
think
that
any
immunity
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
in
the
what?
i
didn't
understand
you
mr.
justice.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
leaving
that
way.
but
i
do
say
that
all
the
question
of
corruptness
is
decide
the
issue
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
we
don't
have
to
go
whether
they
have
actually
corrupt,
actual
corrupt
evidence
because
there
was
none.
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
anything
except
the
judge
giving
his
best
judgment
which
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
immunity
of
the
police
officers
because
if
there
is
anyone
that
i
feel
have
stand
here
that
needs
representation
and
that
i
would
like
to
do
my
best
to
represent,
it
is
the
policeman
on
these
trouble
times.
when
he
doesn't
know
what
to
do,
he
has
to
make
snap
decisions.
he
has
no
lawyer
running
along
his
side
to
tell
him
what
the
law
is
and
what
the
facts
are
whether
he's
right.
he
can't
remember
afterwards,
take
all
his
could
in
this
past
summer
then
thousands
of
arrests
where
a
policeman
have
arrested
people
where
they
have
thought
at
the
time
that
they
were
justified.
suppose
one
of
those
men
three
years
later
say
well
i
was
acquitted.
the
policeman
doesn't
remember
he
hasn't
got
down
witnesses
and
get
names,
get
ready
for
a
lawsuit
three
or
four
years
from
now.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
fine
points
of
the
law.
he
has
got
to
use
his
best
judgment
in
whether
or
not
there
is
violence
about
to
occur.
and
that
is
what
we
submit.
that
is
the
common
law
immunity
of
police
officers,
it
just
as
goes
as
far
back
as
the
immunity
of
judges.
if
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
there's
probable
cause
about
a
balance,
then
under
the
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
they
have
a
right
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
in
other
words,
probable
cause
is
a
complete
defense
to
the
police
officers
who
are
sued
for
damages
at
common
law.
there
is
no
change
under
the
1983
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
false
arrest,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
plainly
monroe
versus
pape
does
not
say
--
it
doesn't
say
to
the
contrary.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
because
that
was
a
search
and
seizure
case
and
under
the
search
and
seizure
case
there
is
no
defense
of
probable
cause.
they
searched
the
man's
house
not
in
good
faith
and
also
search
it
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
without
a
warrant
and
for
false
imprisonment
case,
probable
cause
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
is
a
complete
defense.
in
illegal
search
without
a
prior
arrest,
probable
cause
is
no
defense
whatsoever.
when
that
case
was
remanded
it
was
only
before
this
court
because
the
complaint
had
been
dismissed
does
not
state
in
the
cause
of
action
and
this
court
merely
said
that
it's
stated
a
cause
of
action
and
remanded
it
which
i
don't
make
any
complaint
because
it
came
into
nearer
to
state
cause
of
action
than
that
one
--
complete
the
state
of
the
cause
of
action
than
that
one
did.
this
cause
remanded
it
and
they
resulted
in
the
district
court
in
the
jury
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
and
then
the
defendants
of
motion
judgments
notwithstanding
brought
up
that
the
probable
cause
for
the
search
and
the
district
court
dismissed
it
and
said
that
probable
cause
is
no
defense
whatsoever
to
an
illegal
search
because
of
the
constitutional
provision
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
defense
whatsoever
to
that.
there
has
been
no
change
in
that
common
law
rule
any
more
than
immunity
of
judges
in
the
--
under
1983.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
this
is
the
point
under
which
we
petition
cross-appeal,
cross-certiorari
on
the
ground
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
probable
cause
was
a
defense
to
the
common
law
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
not
to
1983.
in
the
opinion,
they
merely
said
that
the
rule
may
be
otherwise
under
1983
and
cited
no
case
which
is
held
that
is
different
under
1983
and
yet
held
that
under
1983
probable
cause
was
no
defense
and
because
if
this
when
this
case
goes
back
we
should
have
it
a
right
to
submit
in
that
jury
again
is
or
whether
or
not
those
police
officers
because
the
common
law
controls
and
still
is
effective
just
as
much
as
to
police
officers
under
1983
that
would
be
to
judicial
officers.
the
monroe
said
that
the
1983
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
common
law
tort
liability.
it
has
not
in
any
way
changed
the
common
law
of
what
the
tort
is
that
they
could
be
sued
for
and
in
this
instance
it
was
false
imprisonment.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
in
any
doubt
in
its
thorough
brief
of
false
imprisonment
is
a
complete
defense
of
the
common
law
i
mean
that
the
probable
cause
is
a
complete
defense
at
the
common
law.
all
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
to
the
court
there
decision
was
that
inherent
in
the
monroe
holding
if
the
principle
was
in
good
faith
and
relied
on
the
state
statute
subsequently
declared
invalid
are
not
valid
as
the
defenses.
i
do
not
have
time
to
point
out
your
honor
that
the
section
breach
of
peace
statute
has
never
been
held
unconstitutional.
now,
this
court
at
the
time
this
occurred,
the
rule
was
then
final
and
which
was
held
constitutional.
in
thomas
versus
state
two
years
after
this
occurrence,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
held
it
valid.
this
is
unlike
edwards
versus
south
carolina
or
cox
versus
louisiana
where
the
court
held
that
if
the
statute
was
vague
because
it
said
that
breach
of
the
peace
could
include
such
things
as
this
rest
or
this
qua
of
vague
general
words.
in
mississippi
and
thomas
versus
state
they
held
it
had,
it
meant
violence
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
required
violence.
and
that's
what
the
proof
of
this
case
showed
that
the
police
officers
believe
but
even
if
this
court
should
now
hold
--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
that
violence
was
imminent.
our
statute
permits
a
cause
--
a
breach
of
the
peace.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
under
such
circumstances,
now
the
breach
of
the
peace
are
valid
as
our
court
interpreted
it
can
maybe
can
occur
is
the
language
of
the
statute
but
even
if
this
court
should
now
six
years
later
or
five
years
later
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional,
which
i
don't
think
it
will
that's
not
even
pled,
they
didn't
that
it's
unconstitutional
statute.
the
rule
in
mississippi
and
the
rule
of
most
places
is
that
unconstitutional
law
is
a
nullity
cannot
be
applied
to
work
hardship
to
oppose
liability
on
a
public
officer
who
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
was
acting
in
good
faith
in
reliance
on
the
validity
of
the
statute
before
any
court
has
decided
it
in
valid.
mississippi
follows
that
rule.
most
of
the
fact
if
not
all
of
the
rules
note
that
as
an
exception
that
a
public
officer
cannot
be
held.
there's
a
difference
between
the
ham
case
where
you
say
a
conviction
can
be
handed
down
and
the
--
the
opposite
here
where
you
can't
impose
liability
on
someone
which
were
illegal
when
they
did
it
and
then
come
along
six
years
later,
saying
we're
going
to
make
that,
that
there
was
constitutional
statute
then
but
we're
going
to
make
it
illegal
now.
i
do
not
have
time
to
go
into
the
point
on
petition
that
planned
that
that
is
not
just
a
defense,
the
planning
to
come
and
not
just
to
anticipate
and
they
might
be
arrested
but
planning
to
come.
that
is
not
a
mere
defense
like
assumption
of
written
(inaudible)
opposing
counsel
would
have
you
believe,
it's
inherent
in
the
talk
itself
there
is
no
false
imprisonment
if
there
was
consent
just
as
there
no
(inaudible)
if
there
was
consent,
there's
no
assault
if
there's
consent.
there
are
certain
torts
that
whenever
there
is
consent,
there
are
no
tort
to
begin
with
so
it's
different
from
a
defense.
i
would
like
to
urge--
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
i
urge
the
court
to
give
this
case
serious
consideration
because
of
its
importance
in
the
future
litigation
of
the
thousands
of
cases
in
the
federal
court
and
on
the
effect,
it
will
have
on
the
police
force
all
over
the
country
if
they
are
subject
to
sue
and
subject
to
money
damages
with
little
pay
in
families
and
they
are
subject
upon
to
suits
for
damages.
it
can
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
protection
of
the
public.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
oh
no
sir.
i
said,
our
position
is
that
there
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes
sir
and
i
think
they
thoroughly
misunderstood
it.
it
was
a
search
and
seizure
case
by
probable
cause
had
no
--
there's
no
defense
whatsoever.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
they
say
it's
inherent
in
monroe
versus
pape
that
the
good
faith
under
the
state's
statute
come
on
excess
under
1983
only
was
immaterial.
monroe
versus
pape
didn't
even
deal
with
acting
under
state
statute
in
good
faith
believing
it
was
to
be
valid.
there
they
were
acting
without
any
--
on
contrary
to
the
state
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
misapplied.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
acting
under
a
state
statute
which
would
later
declare
unconstitutional.
they
were
acting
without
statute
because
contrary
to
the
state
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
mr.
black.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
the
state
is
not
here.
you
mean
the
petitioner,
the
one
error
of
the
court
below
in
saying
that
the
probable
cause
is
not
a
defense
to
false
imprisonment
under
1983.
they
said
it
was
a
defense
under
the
common
law.
but
they
held
it
was
not
a
defense
under
1983
with
we
submit
with
no
justification
presented.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
yes,
we
submit
it
to
a
new
jury.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
on
the
new
trial.
ms.
elizabeth
watkins
hulen
grayson
well,
we
in
our
brief
we
have
said
that
felt
the
fifth
circuit
differed
on
error
erred
in
saying
that
those
were
errors
in
the
evidence
but
i
have
not
have
time
to
argue.
they
were
just
small
matters
of
evidence.
