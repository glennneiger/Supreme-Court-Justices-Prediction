justice

l.

is
it
your
argument
that
every
judge
who
turned
somebody
to
lose
can
be
sued
and
has
no
immunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
them
could
be
sued
for
it
and
will
have
to
prove
his
motive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument.
every
judge
who
tries
a
person
in
united
states
under
this
act
can
be
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
that
act
and
if
convicted
of
the
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
appellate
court
judges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
it
could
apply
to
federal
judges.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
that
apply
to
supreme
court
judges
of
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
theoretically,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
actually
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
to
try
on
the
basis
of
evidence
how
guilty
they
thought
the
man
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
few
defendants
who've
been
convicted
who
didn't
think
that
they
were
deprived
the
right
roughly
and
prove
by
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
questions
do
not
mean
that
i
would
say
that
you
are
wrong
but
it
seems
to
me
like
that's
precisely
direct
statement
if
you
may
that
the
consequences
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mrs.
grayson,
where
will
we
find
in
the
record
there
statement
to
say
were
coming
jackson
for
the
purpose
of
being
arrested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
ten
year
(inaudible),
i
was
in
there
too.
i
never
had
any
remote
idea
that
you
should
get
those
words
that
leads
to
the
impression
that
a
legislator
making
a
speech
working
on
the
legislative
body
could
be
sued
by
showing
that
he
was
corrupt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
familiar
with
anything
in
it
but
i
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
held
was
that
he's
immune?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
trial,
absolutely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
in
the
senate
just
what
is
the
question
the
state
presents
in
its
petition
for
certiorari?
justice

your
