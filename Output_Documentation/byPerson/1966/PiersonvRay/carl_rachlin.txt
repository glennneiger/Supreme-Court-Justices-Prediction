mr.
carl
rachlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
complaint
here
alleged
two
causes
of
action,
one
based
upon
title
42,
section
1983
of
the
18
--
based
upon
the
1871
civil
rights
act
and
the
second
cause
of
action
was
a
common
law
action
for
false
imprisonment.
the
defendants
in
each
--
of
each
of
these
causes
of
action
were
the
police
officers
and
the
convicting
magistrate
who
had
incarcerated
the
petitioners
herein,
the
petitioners
being
one
of
negro
and
three
white
episcopal
ministers
who
were
arrested
in
the
bus
station
in
jackson,
mississippi.
at
the
trial,
before
on
the
damage
question
which
is
present
before
this
court
before
judge
mize
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
before
him
in
a
jury,
there
was
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
that
is
the
respondents
here.
the
petitioners
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
because
of
errors
made
by
judge
mize
with
regard
to
the
admission
of
evidence.
however,
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
case
against
the
magistrate
respondents
pierson
here
and
in
so
far
of
damages
was
concerned
set
forth
a
rule
on
the
new
trial
which
indicated
that
if
there
was
a
finding,
that
there
was
a
plan
and
purpose
to
be
arrested
then
the
petitioners
here
could
not
recover
in
the
trial.
it
was
on
those
two
issues
purely.
on
those
two
issues
mainly
that
we
came
to
this
court
and
upon
our
petition
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
mr.
carl
rachlin
they
are
raised
in
the
cross-petition
your
honor
by
my
colleague
but
they
are
not
raised
by
us.
now,
very
briefly
and
i
will
try
to
be
very
brief
because
there
are
the
forth
questions
of
law
and
noble
to
this
court.
very
briefly,
the
facts
are
as
follows.
the
general
convention
of
the
episcopal
church,
the
trial
in
general
convention
of
episcopal
church
was
to
be
held
in
september
1961
in
detroit.
the
petitioners
here
particularly
petitioner
reverend
john
morris
who
was
the
director
of
the
episcopal
society
for
cultural
and
racial
unity,
thought
it
would
be
great
witness
for
that
church
to
hold
a
prayer
pilgrimage
beginning
in
new
orleans
and
ending
in
detroit
and
on
the
way
bearing
christian
witness
to
factors
in
various
communities
going
up
generally
to
mississippi
valley
on
the
way
to
detroit
with
intention
of
stopping
to
places
like
suwanee,
dearborn,
michigan
as
well
as
jackson,
mississippi
and
they
set
out
by
bus
from
new
orleans
and
arrived
in
jackson
and
spent
the
night
on
the
day
before
the
arrest
were
made
here
at
tougaloo
college.
there
had
been
of
course
some
publicity
in
the
papers
and
the
news,
in
the
radio
about
their
activities.
but
the
next
morning
when
they
went
with
tickets
for
the
--
for
continental
railway
bus
to
chattanooga
and
they
had
not
given
any
publicity,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
anyone
knew
when
they
were
arriving
at
the
bus
station.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
record
reflects
that
when
they
did
arrive
at
the
bus
station
no
one
was
waiting
for
them,
the
police
testimony
was
very
clear
on
that
point.
they
arrived
quietly
in
taxi
cabs.
there
were
two
police
waiting
on
the
back
ramp
of
the
bus
station.
the
police
went
around
the
back
way
and
met
the
priest
as
they
walked
through
the
main
entrance
of
the
bus
station
passed
a
police
expansion
right
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
bus
station
which
said
"white
only
by
order
of
the
police."
as
they
went
into
the
door
of
the
bus
station,
father
jones,
one
of
the
petitioners
here
heard
one
of
the
officer
say,
"shall
we
get
them
now
or
shall
we
wait
until
later.
in
any
event,
the
--
there
were
15
priests
on
this
group,
four
of
whom
are
petitioners
here
walked
through
the
entrance
and
started
towards
the
coffee
shop
a
few
feet
inside
the
bus
station.
a
few
of
them
of
the
15
did
actually
get
into
the
coffee
shop
but
at
that
point,
one
of
the
two
officers,
either
officer
nichols
and
griffith,
two
of
the
respondents
here
halted
them
and
made
them
come
--
those
who
are
in
the
bus
station
come
back
and
they
halt
at
the
whole
group
and
were
told
to
move
on.
at
this
point,
one
of
the
priests
said,
"we're
on
our
way
to
chattanooga.
we
have
tickets
and
we
wanted
to
have
--
it
will
be
a
long
trip,
we
wanted
to
have
coffee
or
sandwich
or
something
before
we
take
off
on
our
trip."
no
coffee,
the
police
officer
said,
"move
on."
with
no
moving
on
they
were
arrested
and
not
being
told,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
why
they
were
they
were
being
arrested
at
that
point
or
what
they
were
being
arrested
for
or
why
they
were
told
to
move
on.
but
in
any
event,
a
few
moments
later
the
respondent
ray,
the
deputy
chief
of
police
of
jackson,
mississippi
at
that
time
the
captain
of
the
police
came
in
the
station
and
immediately
went
up
to
these
people
and
told
him
to
move
on
not
seeking
information
from
the
other
police
officer
who
are
already
under
arrest.
in
any
event,
they
went
on
and
he
told
to
move
on.
they
repeated
the
same
thing,
they
wanted
to
have
a
sandwich
before
they
took
off
to
chattanooga
and
he
at
that
point
not
moving
on,
he
also
arrested
them
and
they
were
then
taken
off
in
the
traditional
jackson
paddy
wagon
to
the
jail
and
whether
they
stay
two
days
later
where
the
case
was
then
tried
before
the
magistrate
spencer
who
convicted
them
and
sentenced
them
him
to
the
maximum
sentence
of
four
months
in
jail
for
the
offense
that
they
committed
as
well
as
a
fine
which
was
put
upon
them.
all
the
petitioners
here
remained
in
jail
for
at
least
seven
and
father
jones
i
think
something
like
17
or
18
days.
the
reason
being
that
bell
was
coming
from
various
communities
to
help
them
out
and
took
at
least
seven
days
to
get
there
and
more
for
father
jones.
in
any
event,
after
they
all
were
released,
they
went
on
to
the
convention,
they
appealed
the
case
and
in
mississippi,
the
first
appellate
procedure
is
this
de
novo
trial
and
after
de
novo
trial
of
father
jones,
the
first
one
tried,
after
the
prosecution's
case
was
in,
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
and
the
judge
presiding
at
that
level
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
there
was
no
showing
of
a
violation
of
the
statute
was
there
and
all
the
other
cases
were
accordingly
now
crossed.
at
that
point,
shortly
thereafter,
the
complaints
served
and
the
case
before
us
and
was
tried
as
i
said
for
judge
mize,
defendant's
verdict
we
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
as
indicated.
now,
the
first
issue
that
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
is
the
one
--
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
action
against
the
convicting
magistrate
spencer,
one
of
the
respondents
herein.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
was
an
error
for
many
reasons
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
somewhat.
the
statute
of
course
1983
the
opening
words
are
every
person
so
that
on
its
face
anyone
who
violates
1983
who
violates
1983,
whoever,
whatever
his
position
in
life
may
be
is
liable.
but
question
then
is,
are
there
any
limitations
in
this
broad
language
which
should
be
a
guide
to
any
court
considering
the
matter.
prior
to
the
well
known
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1951
of
tenney
against
brandhove,
there
had
only
been
one
case
interpreting
this
point
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
and
that
was
the
case
entitled
picking
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
a
third
circuit
case
which
held
in
the
manner
that
we
are
requesting
this
court
to
hold.
that
is
there
was
not
an
immunity
for
a
judge
who
violated
the
statute.
however,
tenney
against
brandhove
set
off
a
whole
line
of
cases
which
i
referred
to
in
both
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
are
referred
to
in
my
worthy
opponent's
brief.
and
in
fact,
i
think
this
court
has
either
accepted
or
is
considering
certiorari
in
two
related
cases
involving
dombrowski
case
and
a
bauers
against
heisel
case
on
related
questions.
every
circuit
deciding
the
case
since
tenney
has
decided
in
a
manner
which
we
consider
in
error
in
interpreting
the
statute.
now,
tenney
involves
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
there's
a
judicial,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
am
not
concerned
with
any
other
questions,
your
honor.
now,
tenney
involves
of
course
a
state
legislature
--
legislator
of
the
state
of
california
who
was
sued
under
1983
by
someone
claiming
that
he
tenney
have
violated
his
rights.
now,
under
tenney,
the
majority
decision
was
based
upon
was
considered
to
be
the
ancient
immunity
of
the
legislators
and
there
is
no
other
basis
for
that
decision
as
set
forth
in
the
decision.
oddly
enough,
this,
of
course,
reason
is
irrelevant
because
if
the
1871
congress
wanted
to
specifically
include
state
legislators
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
an
ancient
history
exempting
legislators
would
be
of
no
consequence
whatsoever.
however,
the
majority
decision
in
tenney
is
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
ancient
history
of
immunity
to
state
legislators.
now,
there
were
at
least
two
other
ways
in
which
the
case
could
have
been
decided
in
the
same
--
coming
to
the
same
conclusion
which
would
have
however
been
more
accurately
a
reflection
of
the
law
and
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
those
for
a
moment.
the
first
one
of
course
concerns
the
legislative
history
of
1983.
when
congressman
shielbagga
(ph)
of
ohio
introduced
the
legislation
we
are
concerned
with
in
the
house
of
representative
in
1871,
he
made
the
following
comments
and
i
read
from
the
congressional
law
appendix
of
march
28,
1871
42nd
congress
first
session,
he
said
as
follows.
"my
first
inquiry
is
as
to
the
warrant
which
we
have
for
enacting
such
as
section
as
this.the
model
forth
will
be
found
in
the
second
section
of
the
act
of
89
--
1866."
if
i
may
interpolate,
those
are
the
sections
of
title
18
241
and
242
which
have
been
considered
by
this
court
in
price
for
example
--
u.s.
against
price
for
example.
that
section
provides
a
criminal
proceeding
in
identically
the
same
case
as
this
one
provides
a
civil
remedy.
now,
that
being
so
if
the
majority
opinion
in
tenney
had
followed
that
forth
along
and
would
have
turn
to
senator
trumbull's
explanation
in
the
congressional
globe
of
april
4,
1866
when
he
replied
to
the
veto
by
the
then
president
johnson
of
the
1866
act
title,
that
is
what
now
titled
18241
and
242.
president
johnson
referred
specifically
to
the
point
that
came
up
in
tenney
against
brandhove
and
what
does
he
say?
who
is
to
be
--
and
i
quote
from
page
1758
of
the
act
of
the
congressional
globe
of
april
4,
1866,
"who
is
to
be
punished?"
is
the
law
to
be
punished?
are
the
men
who
make
the
law
to
be
punished?
is
that
the
language
of
the
bill?"
not
at
all.
if
any
person
on
the
color
of
any
law
shall
subject
another
to
the
deprivation
of
a
right
to
which
he
is
entitled,
he
is
to
be
punished.
the
person
who
is
under
the
color
of
the
law,
does
the
act
not
the
man
who
made
the
law"
and
goes
on
in
that
way.
in
other
words,
what
he
is
saying
very
specifically
is
that
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
of
that
period
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
analysis
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
state
legislators
were
immune
under
both
title
18240,
what
is
now
title
182141
and
of
course
under
title
42
1983.
in
other
words,
state
legislators
are
to
be
immune
but
what
does
he
say
about
judges?
in
other
words,
he
makes
the
very
distinction
that
we
are
trying
to
make
in
this
particular
case.
and
because
i
might
interpolate
again,
president
johnson
when
he
vetoed
this
1866
act
two
of
the
reasons
specifically
given
by
him
for
his
veto
concerned
the
immunity
of
legislators
and
that
the
alleged
denials
of
the
legislators
and
the
alleged
denial
of
immunity
of
judges.
now
we
have
seen
senator
trumbull
who
replied
to
president
johnson
as
to
what
he
said
about
legislators.
now
this
is
what
he
said
about
judges.
when
it
is
said
that
under
this
provisions,
judges
of
the
court
and
ministry
of
offices
who
are
engaged
in
the
execution
of
sub-statutes
may
be
punished
and
that
is
made
in
objection
to
this
bill
referring
to
this
president's
veto.
i
admit
that
a
ministry
of
officers
or
a
judge
if
the
acts
corruptly
or
viciously
in
the
execution
or
under
power
of
any
illegal
act
may
be
and
ought
to
be
punished
but
if
he
acted
innocently
the
judge
would
not
be
punished,
and
further
on
a
judge
who
acted
innocently
and
not
viciously
or
oppressively
would
never
be
convicted
under
this
act.
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
are
contending,
your
honor
that
the
judge
here
knowingly
and
willfully
intend
as
our
complaint
alleges
in
paragraph
22
on
page
5
of
the
record
that
the
judge,
so
far
as
judge
is
concerned
convicted
and
deprived
the
petitioners
of
rights,
privilege
and
immunity,
etcetera
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enforcing
the
segregation
laws,
customs,
policies
and
usages
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
contend
that
that
is
what
is
considered
to
be
a
violation
what
we
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
statute,
deliberately
imprisoning
someone
without
any
evidence
in
the
record
and
that
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
accept
that
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
let
me
go
back
to
my
quotation.
we
--
what
senator
trumbull
has
said
here,
the
person
who
has
acted
innocently
the
judge
would
not
be
punished
and
we
don't
dispute
that
--
we
accept
that
of
course.
and
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
what
is
innocence?
because
he
also
says,
if
he
acts
corruptly
or
viciously,
now
i
am
not
--
i
don't
viciously
is
not
a
word
of
art.
it's
common
points
but
i
would
certainly
think
that
that
would
apply
to
a
judge
who
without
evidence
convicted
and
incarcerated
people
knowing
there
was
no
evidence
and
this
is
based
upon
not
only
what
i
say
about
the
case
and
what
the
complaint
says
about
the
case
but
the
fact
that
on
the
first
appellant
level,
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
dismissed
on
the
prosecution's
evidence
because
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
a
violation
of
the
statute.
and
we
say
the
record
reflects,
though
that
is
not
important
from
the
purposes
of
position
we're
taking
here
in
this
case,
that
they
were
convicted
because
there
is
a
sign
outside
the
bus
station
said
that
anyone
who
went
to
that
bus
station
who
was
negro
was
in
violation
of
the
law
because
that
sign
said,
"white
only"
by
order
of
the
police
and
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
what
that
means
except
in
terms
of
anyone
other
than
a
white
person
who
enters
or
whites
and
negroes
who
enter
together
are
in
violation
and
that's
why
they
were
arrested
because
the
testimony
of
the
police
here
says
these
petitioners
did
actually
no
act
which
could
be
remotely
considered
wrong
and
unlike
the
adderley
case,
these
people
had
a
right
to
be
here.
there
was
no
question
they
have
a
right
to
be
in
a
bus
station
quietly
and
peacefully
with
tickets
on
their
hands,
about
to
go
off
to
chattanooga.
whatever
the
merits
of
an
adderley
type
situation,
they
don't
apply
here
at
all
because
these
people
have
a
public
right
to
be
there
and
they
were
asked
to
leave
not
for
anything
they
did
but
because
that
sign
outside
the
door
of
the
station
did
not
permit
them
to
enter
the
station.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
no
question.
he
was
--
he
was
--
they
were
charged
under
a
mississippi
statute
that's
totally
conduct
statute
in
that
sense
he
have
jurisdiction
of
course,
there's
no
question
on
that.
but
we
think
the
intent
or
the
congress
of
1871
from
reading
the
congressional
globe
at
that
time
is
so
carefully
drawn
against
the
sham
justice
that
was
perpetuated
in
the
period
from
1866
through
period
of
1871
but
the
very
kind
of
conduct
that
is
considered
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
conduct
the
1871
congress
was
concerned
about.
they
were
concerned
about
the
phony
justice,
the
sham
justice,
the
police
who
arrest
and
the
judges
who
convict
when
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
wrongdoing.
mr.
carl
rachlin
absolutely
not
because
the
distinction
that
we
draw
and
we
think
that
senator
trumbull
who
draws
the
distinction
perhaps
better
than
we
can,
we
think
that
a
distinction
is
here
that
when
a
judge
knowingly
to
perpetuate
an
illegal
custom
such
as
segregation
then
he
would
be
liable.
but
if
he
makes
a
mere
error
of
judgment
or
is
unacquainted
with
the
law,
that
would
not
be
any
violation
of
1983.
we're
not
questioning
his
right
to
continue
judgment.
we
can't
--
we
do
question
the
right
to
sit
for
example,
to
take
of
a
case
which
i
think
might
lay
out
the
situation.
we
do
question
the
right
of
a
judge
to
meet
with
hoodlums
the
night
before
he
knows
he's
going
to
have
a
try
a
case
and
tell
the
hoodlums,
"okay,
fellows,
i
am
going
to
give
the
--
throw
the
book
at
these
guys
tomorrow
morning
when
i
try
them."
that's
the
kind
of
case
we
are
talking
about.
and
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
the
other
circuits
if
upheld
does
not
permit
1983
to
cover
a
judge
under
those
circumstances.
now,
if
just
--
every
case
that
comes
since
tenney
against
brandhove,
even
with
tenney
who
has
a
state
legislator
case,
every
case
that
has
been
decided
by
the
circuit
courts
and
there
have
been
several
since
then
have
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
tenney,
even
though
tenney
refers
to
a
state
legislator,
those
cases
which
referred
to
judges
are
given
the
decision
in
the
same
manner
as
if
they
have
tenney
--
applications
to
the
tenney
doctrine.
but
tenney
has
in
the
sense
--
if
i
could
be
permitted
to
say
so
led
the
court
astray
by
an
improper
analysis
of
the
statutes
1871,
1866.
it
is
our
position
that
if
tenney
had
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
analysis
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
other
courts
would
not
have
made
the
mistake.
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
magruder
of
the
first
circuit
in
francis
against
crafts
which
has
been
referred
to
by
the
court
below
and
by
our
worthy
opponents
is
a
typical
case
where
judge
magruder
in
that
position
says,
the
statute
is
very
broad
and
i
am
very
grateful
that
the
supreme
court
has
decided
tenney
against
brandhove
because
in
effect
it
takes
me
off
hook
and
this
is
precisely
what
judge
magruder
who
was
a
verifying
judge
has
said
in
a
case
involving
a
judge
in
massachusetts,
so
that
the
trouble
has
stemmed
from
what
the
courts
has
decided
in
tenney.
now,
tenney
i
would
hope
that
tenney
would
be
reconsidered
in
terms
of
not
be
decision
because
the
decision
is
basically
correct
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
history
but
it
is
wrong
in
terms
of
the
reason.
if
the
right
reason
is
given
that
all
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
decided
after
tenney
become
meaningless
and
this
court
then
is
considering
not
only
de
novo
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
issue
that
has
the
liability
of
the
judge
under
the
statute
but
is
not
--
is
not
based
with
the
question
of
decisions
made
by
the
lower
courts
to
the
contrary
and
there's
only
--
then
there
was
only
one
decision
which
has
a
meaning
and
that's
picking
against
pennsylvania
railroad.
hardly
enough,
not
one
of
the
cases
with
the
exception
of
bauers
against
heisel
which
i
believe
this
submitted
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
when
we
decide
a
month
ago
by
the
third
circuit
not
one
of
the
cases
following
tenney
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
a
new
jersey
state
prosecutor,
your
honor,
yes.
that's
the
only
one
of
the
cases
which
even
makes
a
brushing
reference
to
the
legislative
history.
mr.
carl
rachlin
by
the
third
circuit
your
honor
and
the
third
circuit
there
in
substance
said
that
it
was
overruling.
its
prior
decision
in
picking
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad
though
the
one
was
a
judge
and
the
other
was
a
prosecutor
and
perhaps
they
might
to
different
conclusions
under
the
same
statute.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
precisely
that
reason
that
was
partly
judicial
process
and
that
prosecutor
was
part
of
the
process
and
ought
to
be
immune
as
a
judge
but
even
there,
there
the
court
set
en
banc
in
bauers
against
heisel
and
there
were
four
opinions
either
concurring
only
specifically
only
in
the
result
and
specifically
saying
that
they
were
not
going
to
go
into
the
question
of
legislative
history
and
two
that
rejected
the
--
they
rejected
the
decision
because
the
legislative
history
was
on
the
contrary
in
bauers
against
heisel.
in
fact,
judge
vance
of
the
first
circuit
has
what
we
as
the
proper
analysis
of
the
statute
and
goes
into
the
legislative
history
in
some
detail.
whereas
the
majority
of
the
court
there
gives
in
a
footnote
a
brushing
reference
to
a
part
of
the
legislative
history,
ignores
most
of
it
and
ignores
the
result
of
all
and
says,
"we're
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
tenney
against
brandhove."
now,
with
that
kind
of
record,
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
here
nor
in
the
word
of
the
statute
which
sustains
the
immunity
of
judges.
we
think
that
from
the
--
what
we
have
set
in
our
brief,
that
it
was
clearly
the
intention
of
the
1871
and
the
1866
congresses
in
passing
these
two
complementary
statute
that
is
the
criminal
act
under
title
2
--
title
18
and
the
civil
act
in
the
title
42
clearly
unmistakably
intended
to
include
judges
and
what
are
the
proof
of
it
we
say
is
in
the
fact
that
persons
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
in
the
halls
of
congress
acknowledge
this
result.
they
may
have
disagreed
with
the
virtue
of
the
wisdom
of
it
but
they
both
agreed,
they
both
agreed
that
the
judges
were
liable
if
they
committed
a
violation
of
the
act
in
the
terms
of
senator
trumbull
were
not
immune.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
only
judge
who
was
liable
is
one
who
convicts
with
--
and
not
intending
to
deprive
him
of
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
your
honor
that
would
be
true.
mr.
carl
rachlin
on
the
1866
act,
if
he
were
shown
to
be
in
violative
of
the
act,
yes.
we
say
that
there
was
no
immunity
by
the
virtue
of
the
office
and
if
he
violated
the
act,
yes
he
would
be
liable
or
be
in
a
civil
suit
for
damage,
--
he
is
liable
for
damages
if
it
were
shown
and
prove
a
violation
of
the
act.
we
--
i
don't
--
it
isn't
--
of
course
people
can
be
sued
and
improperly
sued
but
i
would
assume
that
there
are
lots
of
people
who
hold
important
positions
in
the
united
states
that
could
be
sued
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
first
it
doesn't
apply
to
federal
judges,
your
honor.
the
federal
judges
are
exempt
by
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it
only
applies
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
don't
see
how
it
could,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it
does
not
apply
only
criminal
act
under
the
color
of
the
state
law.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
suppose
theoretically,
it
could.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
actually
in
the
sense
that
yes
they
could
be
sued
and
if
they
were
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
would
be
so,
your
honor.
and
i
--
but
i
think
that
while
that
i
think
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
there
are
lots
of
people.
there
are
particularly,
it
takes
a
surgeon
who
holds
a
person's
life
in
its
hands
every
time
he
operates
on
someone
has
no
immunity
and
if
a
judge
acts
corruptly
or
viciously
would
and
when
there
is
no
evidence
and
with
a
deliberate
intent
to
deprive
somebody
of
a
right
that
he
is
entitled
to.
i
can
see
no
reason
why
a
judge
would
be
in
put
in
a
position
that
a
surgeon
is
not.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
that
may
be
true
but
in
the
case
before
us,
your
honor,
that
isn't
the
facts.
the
--
the
fact
is
of
a
first
appellate
level,
the
case
was
dismissed
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
a
violation
of
the
statute
in
the
first
place.
and
whatever
that
may
be
in
other
situations
and
that
we
are
saying
that
there
should
be
no
rule
which
grants
an
automatic
immunity.
we
say
that
there
is
only
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
and
your
honor
is
correct
and
those
are
possible
consequences
of
the
argument
i
make
and
i
would
have
to
face
that,
put
her
back.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
it
goes
to
this
extent
--
i'm
sorry,
i
should
have
brought.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
i
think,
i
am
sorry
but
i
would
think
that
if
a
judge
convicts
somebody
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enforcing
segregation
laws,
customs,
that's
spelled
out
a
violation.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
they
--
they
were
convicted
under
the
color
of
the
state
law,
that
is
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
of
the
state
but
not
because
there
was
any
evidence
showing
a
violation
of
the
state
statute
but
solely
for
the
purpose
of
convicting
and
incarcerating
these
people
because
the
state
contended
to
uphold
the
segregation
laws
of
the
state
and
if
he
merely
made
a
mistake
of
the
evidence,
we
would
say
that
no
matter
how
long
it
might
be
that
we
would
not
think
he
was
liable
but
where
he
does
it
with
the
intent
as
we
say
for
the
purpose
of
upholding
the
laws,
we
think
that
spelled
out
the
same
thing
that's
going
to
--
it
sums
in
the
trouble
we're
discussing.
the
second
--
i'm
sorry
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
carl
rachlin
mrs.
grayson.
mr.
carl
rachlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
complaint
here
alleged
two
causes
of
action,
one
based
upon
title
42,
section
1983
of
the
18
--
based
upon
the
1871
civil
rights
act
and
the
second
cause
of
action
was
a
common
law
action
for
false
imprisonment.
the
defendants
in
each
--
of
each
of
these
causes
of
action
were
the
police
officers
and
the
convicting
magistrate
who
had
incarcerated
the
petitioners
herein,
the
petitioners
being
one
of
negro
and
three
white
episcopal
ministers
who
were
arrested
in
the
bus
station
in
jackson,
mississippi.
at
the
trial,
before
on
the
damage
question
which
is
present
before
this
court
before
judge
mize
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
before
him
in
a
jury,
there
was
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
that
is
the
respondents
here.
the
petitioners
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
because
of
errors
made
by
judge
mize
with
regard
to
the
admission
of
evidence.
however,
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
case
against
the
magistrate
respondents
pierson
here
and
in
so
far
of
damages
was
concerned
set
forth
a
rule
on
the
new
trial
which
indicated
that
if
there
was
a
finding,
that
there
was
a
plan
and
purpose
to
be
arrested
then
the
petitioners
here
could
not
recover
in
the
trial.
it
was
on
those
two
issues
purely.
on
those
two
issues
mainly
that
we
came
to
this
court
and
upon
our
petition
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
mr.
carl
rachlin
they
are
raised
in
the
cross-petition
your
honor
by
my
colleague
but
they
are
not
raised
by
us.
now,
very
briefly
and
i
will
try
to
be
very
brief
because
there
are
the
forth
questions
of
law
and
noble
to
this
court.
very
briefly,
the
facts
are
as
follows.
the
general
convention
of
the
episcopal
church,
the
trial
in
general
convention
of
episcopal
church
was
to
be
held
in
september
1961
in
detroit.
the
petitioners
here
particularly
petitioner
reverend
john
morris
who
was
the
director
of
the
episcopal
society
for
cultural
and
racial
unity,
thought
it
would
be
great
witness
for
that
church
to
hold
a
prayer
pilgrimage
beginning
in
new
orleans
and
ending
in
detroit
and
on
the
way
bearing
christian
witness
to
factors
in
various
communities
going
up
generally
to
mississippi
valley
on
the
way
to
detroit
with
intention
of
stopping
to
places
like
suwanee,
dearborn,
michigan
as
well
as
jackson,
mississippi
and
they
set
out
by
bus
from
new
orleans
and
arrived
in
jackson
and
spent
the
night
on
the
day
before
the
arrest
were
made
here
at
tougaloo
college.
there
had
been
of
course
some
publicity
in
the
papers
and
the
news,
in
the
radio
about
their
activities.
but
the
next
morning
when
they
went
with
tickets
for
the
--
for
continental
railway
bus
to
chattanooga
and
they
had
not
given
any
publicity,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
anyone
knew
when
they
were
arriving
at
the
bus
station.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
record
reflects
that
when
they
did
arrive
at
the
bus
station
no
one
was
waiting
for
them,
the
police
testimony
was
very
clear
on
that
point.
they
arrived
quietly
in
taxi
cabs.
there
were
two
police
waiting
on
the
back
ramp
of
the
bus
station.
the
police
went
around
the
back
way
and
met
the
priest
as
they
walked
through
the
main
entrance
of
the
bus
station
passed
a
police
expansion
right
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
bus
station
which
said
"white
only
by
order
of
the
police."
as
they
went
into
the
door
of
the
bus
station,
father
jones,
one
of
the
petitioners
here
heard
one
of
the
officer
say,
"shall
we
get
them
now
or
shall
we
wait
until
later.
in
any
event,
the
--
there
were
15
priests
on
this
group,
four
of
whom
are
petitioners
here
walked
through
the
entrance
and
started
towards
the
coffee
shop
a
few
feet
inside
the
bus
station.
a
few
of
them
of
the
15
did
actually
get
into
the
coffee
shop
but
at
that
point,
one
of
the
two
officers,
either
officer
nichols
and
griffith,
two
of
the
respondents
here
halted
them
and
made
them
come
--
those
who
are
in
the
bus
station
come
back
and
they
halt
at
the
whole
group
and
were
told
to
move
on.
at
this
point,
one
of
the
priests
said,
"we're
on
our
way
to
chattanooga.
we
have
tickets
and
we
wanted
to
have
--
it
will
be
a
long
trip,
we
wanted
to
have
coffee
or
sandwich
or
something
before
we
take
off
on
our
trip."
no
coffee,
the
police
officer
said,
"move
on."
with
no
moving
on
they
were
arrested
and
not
being
told,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
why
they
were
they
were
being
arrested
at
that
point
or
what
they
were
being
arrested
for
or
why
they
were
told
to
move
on.
but
in
any
event,
a
few
moments
later
the
respondent
ray,
the
deputy
chief
of
police
of
jackson,
mississippi
at
that
time
the
captain
of
the
police
came
in
the
station
and
immediately
went
up
to
these
people
and
told
him
to
move
on
not
seeking
information
from
the
other
police
officer
who
are
already
under
arrest.
in
any
event,
they
went
on
and
he
told
to
move
on.
they
repeated
the
same
thing,
they
wanted
to
have
a
sandwich
before
they
took
off
to
chattanooga
and
he
at
that
point
not
moving
on,
he
also
arrested
them
and
they
were
then
taken
off
in
the
traditional
jackson
paddy
wagon
to
the
jail
and
whether
they
stay
two
days
later
where
the
case
was
then
tried
before
the
magistrate
spencer
who
convicted
them
and
sentenced
them
him
to
the
maximum
sentence
of
four
months
in
jail
for
the
offense
that
they
committed
as
well
as
a
fine
which
was
put
upon
them.
all
the
petitioners
here
remained
in
jail
for
at
least
seven
and
father
jones
i
think
something
like
17
or
18
days.
the
reason
being
that
bell
was
coming
from
various
communities
to
help
them
out
and
took
at
least
seven
days
to
get
there
and
more
for
father
jones.
in
any
event,
after
they
all
were
released,
they
went
on
to
the
convention,
they
appealed
the
case
and
in
mississippi,
the
first
appellate
procedure
is
this
de
novo
trial
and
after
de
novo
trial
of
father
jones,
the
first
one
tried,
after
the
prosecution's
case
was
in,
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
and
the
judge
presiding
at
that
level
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
there
was
no
showing
of
a
violation
of
the
statute
was
there
and
all
the
other
cases
were
accordingly
now
crossed.
at
that
point,
shortly
thereafter,
the
complaints
served
and
the
case
before
us
and
was
tried
as
i
said
for
judge
mize,
defendant's
verdict
we
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
as
indicated.
now,
the
first
issue
that
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
is
the
one
--
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
the
action
against
the
convicting
magistrate
spencer,
one
of
the
respondents
herein.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
was
an
error
for
many
reasons
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
somewhat.
the
statute
of
course
1983
the
opening
words
are
every
person
so
that
on
its
face
anyone
who
violates
1983
who
violates
1983,
whoever,
whatever
his
position
in
life
may
be
is
liable.
but
question
then
is,
are
there
any
limitations
in
this
broad
language
which
should
be
a
guide
to
any
court
considering
the
matter.
prior
to
the
well
known
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1951
of
tenney
against
brandhove,
there
had
only
been
one
case
interpreting
this
point
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
and
that
was
the
case
entitled
picking
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
a
third
circuit
case
which
held
in
the
manner
that
we
are
requesting
this
court
to
hold.
that
is
there
was
not
an
immunity
for
a
judge
who
violated
the
statute.
however,
tenney
against
brandhove
set
off
a
whole
line
of
cases
which
i
referred
to
in
both
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
are
referred
to
in
my
worthy
opponent's
brief.
and
in
fact,
i
think
this
court
has
either
accepted
or
is
considering
certiorari
in
two
related
cases
involving
dombrowski
case
and
a
bauers
against
heisel
case
on
related
questions.
every
circuit
deciding
the
case
since
tenney
has
decided
in
a
manner
which
we
consider
in
error
in
interpreting
the
statute.
now,
tenney
involves
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
there's
a
judicial,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
am
not
concerned
with
any
other
questions,
your
honor.
now,
tenney
involves
of
course
a
state
legislature
--
legislator
of
the
state
of
california
who
was
sued
under
1983
by
someone
claiming
that
he
tenney
have
violated
his
rights.
now,
under
tenney,
the
majority
decision
was
based
upon
was
considered
to
be
the
ancient
immunity
of
the
legislators
and
there
is
no
other
basis
for
that
decision
as
set
forth
in
the
decision.
oddly
enough,
this,
of
course,
reason
is
irrelevant
because
if
the
1871
congress
wanted
to
specifically
include
state
legislators
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
an
ancient
history
exempting
legislators
would
be
of
no
consequence
whatsoever.
however,
the
majority
decision
in
tenney
is
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
ancient
history
of
immunity
to
state
legislators.
now,
there
were
at
least
two
other
ways
in
which
the
case
could
have
been
decided
in
the
same
--
coming
to
the
same
conclusion
which
would
have
however
been
more
accurately
a
reflection
of
the
law
and
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
those
for
a
moment.
the
first
one
of
course
concerns
the
legislative
history
of
1983.
when
congressman
shielbagga
(ph)
of
ohio
introduced
the
legislation
we
are
concerned
with
in
the
house
of
representative
in
1871,
he
made
the
following
comments
and
i
read
from
the
congressional
law
appendix
of
march
28,
1871
42nd
congress
first
session,
he
said
as
follows.
"my
first
inquiry
is
as
to
the
warrant
which
we
have
for
enacting
such
as
section
as
this.the
model
forth
will
be
found
in
the
second
section
of
the
act
of
89
--
1866."
if
i
may
interpolate,
those
are
the
sections
of
title
18
241
and
242
which
have
been
considered
by
this
court
in
price
for
example
--
u.s.
against
price
for
example.
that
section
provides
a
criminal
proceeding
in
identically
the
same
case
as
this
one
provides
a
civil
remedy.
now,
that
being
so
if
the
majority
opinion
in
tenney
had
followed
that
forth
along
and
would
have
turn
to
senator
trumbull's
explanation
in
the
congressional
globe
of
april
4,
1866
when
he
replied
to
the
veto
by
the
then
president
johnson
of
the
1866
act
title,
that
is
what
now
titled
18241
and
242.
president
johnson
referred
specifically
to
the
point
that
came
up
in
tenney
against
brandhove
and
what
does
he
say?
who
is
to
be
--
and
i
quote
from
page
1758
of
the
act
of
the
congressional
globe
of
april
4,
1866,
"who
is
to
be
punished?"
is
the
law
to
be
punished?
are
the
men
who
make
the
law
to
be
punished?
is
that
the
language
of
the
bill?"
not
at
all.
if
any
person
on
the
color
of
any
law
shall
subject
another
to
the
deprivation
of
a
right
to
which
he
is
entitled,
he
is
to
be
punished.
the
person
who
is
under
the
color
of
the
law,
does
the
act
not
the
man
who
made
the
law"
and
goes
on
in
that
way.
in
other
words,
what
he
is
saying
very
specifically
is
that
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
of
that
period
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
analysis
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
state
legislators
were
immune
under
both
title
18240,
what
is
now
title
182141
and
of
course
under
title
42
1983.
in
other
words,
state
legislators
are
to
be
immune
but
what
does
he
say
about
judges?
in
other
words,
he
makes
the
very
distinction
that
we
are
trying
to
make
in
this
particular
case.
and
because
i
might
interpolate
again,
president
johnson
when
he
vetoed
this
1866
act
two
of
the
reasons
specifically
given
by
him
for
his
veto
concerned
the
immunity
of
legislators
and
that
the
alleged
denials
of
the
legislators
and
the
alleged
denial
of
immunity
of
judges.
now
we
have
seen
senator
trumbull
who
replied
to
president
johnson
as
to
what
he
said
about
legislators.
now
this
is
what
he
said
about
judges.
when
it
is
said
that
under
this
provisions,
judges
of
the
court
and
ministry
of
offices
who
are
engaged
in
the
execution
of
sub-statutes
may
be
punished
and
that
is
made
in
objection
to
this
bill
referring
to
this
president's
veto.
i
admit
that
a
ministry
of
officers
or
a
judge
if
the
acts
corruptly
or
viciously
in
the
execution
or
under
power
of
any
illegal
act
may
be
and
ought
to
be
punished
but
if
he
acted
innocently
the
judge
would
not
be
punished,
and
further
on
a
judge
who
acted
innocently
and
not
viciously
or
oppressively
would
never
be
convicted
under
this
act.
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
are
contending,
your
honor
that
the
judge
here
knowingly
and
willfully
intend
as
our
complaint
alleges
in
paragraph
22
on
page
5
of
the
record
that
the
judge,
so
far
as
judge
is
concerned
convicted
and
deprived
the
petitioners
of
rights,
privilege
and
immunity,
etcetera
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enforcing
the
segregation
laws,
customs,
policies
and
usages
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
contend
that
that
is
what
is
considered
to
be
a
violation
what
we
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
statute,
deliberately
imprisoning
someone
without
any
evidence
in
the
record
and
that
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
accept
that
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
let
me
go
back
to
my
quotation.
we
--
what
senator
trumbull
has
said
here,
the
person
who
has
acted
innocently
the
judge
would
not
be
punished
and
we
don't
dispute
that
--
we
accept
that
of
course.
and
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
what
is
innocence?
because
he
also
says,
if
he
acts
corruptly
or
viciously,
now
i
am
not
--
i
don't
viciously
is
not
a
word
of
art.
it's
common
points
but
i
would
certainly
think
that
that
would
apply
to
a
judge
who
without
evidence
convicted
and
incarcerated
people
knowing
there
was
no
evidence
and
this
is
based
upon
not
only
what
i
say
about
the
case
and
what
the
complaint
says
about
the
case
but
the
fact
that
on
the
first
appellant
level,
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
dismissed
on
the
prosecution's
evidence
because
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
a
violation
of
the
statute.
and
we
say
the
record
reflects,
though
that
is
not
important
from
the
purposes
of
position
we're
taking
here
in
this
case,
that
they
were
convicted
because
there
is
a
sign
outside
the
bus
station
said
that
anyone
who
went
to
that
bus
station
who
was
negro
was
in
violation
of
the
law
because
that
sign
said,
"white
only"
by
order
of
the
police
and
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
what
that
means
except
in
terms
of
anyone
other
than
a
white
person
who
enters
or
whites
and
negroes
who
enter
together
are
in
violation
and
that's
why
they
were
arrested
because
the
testimony
of
the
police
here
says
these
petitioners
did
actually
no
act
which
could
be
remotely
considered
wrong
and
unlike
the
adderley
case,
these
people
had
a
right
to
be
here.
there
was
no
question
they
have
a
right
to
be
in
a
bus
station
quietly
and
peacefully
with
tickets
on
their
hands,
about
to
go
off
to
chattanooga.
whatever
the
merits
of
an
adderley
type
situation,
they
don't
apply
here
at
all
because
these
people
have
a
public
right
to
be
there
and
they
were
asked
to
leave
not
for
anything
they
did
but
because
that
sign
outside
the
door
of
the
station
did
not
permit
them
to
enter
the
station.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
no
question.
he
was
--
he
was
--
they
were
charged
under
a
mississippi
statute
that's
totally
conduct
statute
in
that
sense
he
have
jurisdiction
of
course,
there's
no
question
on
that.
but
we
think
the
intent
or
the
congress
of
1871
from
reading
the
congressional
globe
at
that
time
is
so
carefully
drawn
against
the
sham
justice
that
was
perpetuated
in
the
period
from
1866
through
period
of
1871
but
the
very
kind
of
conduct
that
is
considered
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
conduct
the
1871
congress
was
concerned
about.
they
were
concerned
about
the
phony
justice,
the
sham
justice,
the
police
who
arrest
and
the
judges
who
convict
when
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
wrongdoing.
mr.
carl
rachlin
absolutely
not
because
the
distinction
that
we
draw
and
we
think
that
senator
trumbull
who
draws
the
distinction
perhaps
better
than
we
can,
we
think
that
a
distinction
is
here
that
when
a
judge
knowingly
to
perpetuate
an
illegal
custom
such
as
segregation
then
he
would
be
liable.
but
if
he
makes
a
mere
error
of
judgment
or
is
unacquainted
with
the
law,
that
would
not
be
any
violation
of
1983.
we're
not
questioning
his
right
to
continue
judgment.
we
can't
--
we
do
question
the
right
to
sit
for
example,
to
take
of
a
case
which
i
think
might
lay
out
the
situation.
we
do
question
the
right
of
a
judge
to
meet
with
hoodlums
the
night
before
he
knows
he's
going
to
have
a
try
a
case
and
tell
the
hoodlums,
"okay,
fellows,
i
am
going
to
give
the
--
throw
the
book
at
these
guys
tomorrow
morning
when
i
try
them."
that's
the
kind
of
case
we
are
talking
about.
and
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
the
other
circuits
if
upheld
does
not
permit
1983
to
cover
a
judge
under
those
circumstances.
now,
if
just
--
every
case
that
comes
since
tenney
against
brandhove,
even
with
tenney
who
has
a
state
legislator
case,
every
case
that
has
been
decided
by
the
circuit
courts
and
there
have
been
several
since
then
have
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
tenney,
even
though
tenney
refers
to
a
state
legislator,
those
cases
which
referred
to
judges
are
given
the
decision
in
the
same
manner
as
if
they
have
tenney
--
applications
to
the
tenney
doctrine.
but
tenney
has
in
the
sense
--
if
i
could
be
permitted
to
say
so
led
the
court
astray
by
an
improper
analysis
of
the
statutes
1871,
1866.
it
is
our
position
that
if
tenney
had
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
analysis
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
other
courts
would
not
have
made
the
mistake.
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
magruder
of
the
first
circuit
in
francis
against
crafts
which
has
been
referred
to
by
the
court
below
and
by
our
worthy
opponents
is
a
typical
case
where
judge
magruder
in
that
position
says,
the
statute
is
very
broad
and
i
am
very
grateful
that
the
supreme
court
has
decided
tenney
against
brandhove
because
in
effect
it
takes
me
off
hook
and
this
is
precisely
what
judge
magruder
who
was
a
verifying
judge
has
said
in
a
case
involving
a
judge
in
massachusetts,
so
that
the
trouble
has
stemmed
from
what
the
courts
has
decided
in
tenney.
now,
tenney
i
would
hope
that
tenney
would
be
reconsidered
in
terms
of
not
be
decision
because
the
decision
is
basically
correct
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
history
but
it
is
wrong
in
terms
of
the
reason.
if
the
right
reason
is
given
that
all
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
decided
after
tenney
become
meaningless
and
this
court
then
is
considering
not
only
de
novo
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
issue
that
has
the
liability
of
the
judge
under
the
statute
but
is
not
--
is
not
based
with
the
question
of
decisions
made
by
the
lower
courts
to
the
contrary
and
there's
only
--
then
there
was
only
one
decision
which
has
a
meaning
and
that's
picking
against
pennsylvania
railroad.
hardly
enough,
not
one
of
the
cases
with
the
exception
of
bauers
against
heisel
which
i
believe
this
submitted
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
when
we
decide
a
month
ago
by
the
third
circuit
not
one
of
the
cases
following
tenney
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
a
new
jersey
state
prosecutor,
your
honor,
yes.
that's
the
only
one
of
the
cases
which
even
makes
a
brushing
reference
to
the
legislative
history.
mr.
carl
rachlin
by
the
third
circuit
your
honor
and
the
third
circuit
there
in
substance
said
that
it
was
overruling.
its
prior
decision
in
picking
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad
though
the
one
was
a
judge
and
the
other
was
a
prosecutor
and
perhaps
they
might
to
different
conclusions
under
the
same
statute.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
precisely
that
reason
that
was
partly
judicial
process
and
that
prosecutor
was
part
of
the
process
and
ought
to
be
immune
as
a
judge
but
even
there,
there
the
court
set
en
banc
in
bauers
against
heisel
and
there
were
four
opinions
either
concurring
only
specifically
only
in
the
result
and
specifically
saying
that
they
were
not
going
to
go
into
the
question
of
legislative
history
and
two
that
rejected
the
--
they
rejected
the
decision
because
the
legislative
history
was
on
the
contrary
in
bauers
against
heisel.
in
fact,
judge
vance
of
the
first
circuit
has
what
we
as
the
proper
analysis
of
the
statute
and
goes
into
the
legislative
history
in
some
detail.
whereas
the
majority
of
the
court
there
gives
in
a
footnote
a
brushing
reference
to
a
part
of
the
legislative
history,
ignores
most
of
it
and
ignores
the
result
of
all
and
says,
"we're
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
tenney
against
brandhove."
now,
with
that
kind
of
record,
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
here
nor
in
the
word
of
the
statute
which
sustains
the
immunity
of
judges.
we
think
that
from
the
--
what
we
have
set
in
our
brief,
that
it
was
clearly
the
intention
of
the
1871
and
the
1866
congresses
in
passing
these
two
complementary
statute
that
is
the
criminal
act
under
title
2
--
title
18
and
the
civil
act
in
the
title
42
clearly
unmistakably
intended
to
include
judges
and
what
are
the
proof
of
it
we
say
is
in
the
fact
that
persons
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
in
the
halls
of
congress
acknowledge
this
result.
they
may
have
disagreed
with
the
virtue
of
the
wisdom
of
it
but
they
both
agreed,
they
both
agreed
that
the
judges
were
liable
if
they
committed
a
violation
of
the
act
in
the
terms
of
senator
trumbull
were
not
immune.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
only
judge
who
was
liable
is
one
who
convicts
with
--
and
not
intending
to
deprive
him
of
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
your
honor
that
would
be
true.
mr.
carl
rachlin
on
the
1866
act,
if
he
were
shown
to
be
in
violative
of
the
act,
yes.
we
say
that
there
was
no
immunity
by
the
virtue
of
the
office
and
if
he
violated
the
act,
yes
he
would
be
liable
or
be
in
a
civil
suit
for
damage,
--
he
is
liable
for
damages
if
it
were
shown
and
prove
a
violation
of
the
act.
we
--
i
don't
--
it
isn't
--
of
course
people
can
be
sued
and
improperly
sued
but
i
would
assume
that
there
are
lots
of
people
who
hold
important
positions
in
the
united
states
that
could
be
sued
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
first
it
doesn't
apply
to
federal
judges,
your
honor.
the
federal
judges
are
exempt
by
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it
only
applies
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
don't
see
how
it
could,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it
does
not
apply
only
criminal
act
under
the
color
of
the
state
law.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
suppose
theoretically,
it
could.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
actually
in
the
sense
that
yes
they
could
be
sued
and
if
they
were
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
would
be
so,
your
honor.
and
i
--
but
i
think
that
while
that
i
think
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
there
are
lots
of
people.
there
are
particularly,
it
takes
a
surgeon
who
holds
a
person's
life
in
its
hands
every
time
he
operates
on
someone
has
no
immunity
and
if
a
judge
acts
corruptly
or
viciously
would
and
when
there
is
no
evidence
and
with
a
deliberate
intent
to
deprive
somebody
of
a
right
that
he
is
entitled
to.
i
can
see
no
reason
why
a
judge
would
be
in
put
in
a
position
that
a
surgeon
is
not.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
that
may
be
true
but
in
the
case
before
us,
your
honor,
that
isn't
the
facts.
the
--
the
fact
is
of
a
first
appellate
level,
the
case
was
dismissed
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
a
violation
of
the
statute
in
the
first
place.
and
whatever
that
may
be
in
other
situations
and
that
we
are
saying
that
there
should
be
no
rule
which
grants
an
automatic
immunity.
we
say
that
there
is
only
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
and
your
honor
is
correct
and
those
are
possible
consequences
of
the
argument
i
make
and
i
would
have
to
face
that,
put
her
back.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
it
goes
to
this
extent
--
i'm
sorry,
i
should
have
brought.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
i
think,
i
am
sorry
but
i
would
think
that
if
a
judge
convicts
somebody
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enforcing
segregation
laws,
customs,
that's
spelled
out
a
violation.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
they
--
they
were
convicted
under
the
color
of
the
state
law,
that
is
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
of
the
state
but
not
because
there
was
any
evidence
showing
a
violation
of
the
state
statute
but
solely
for
the
purpose
of
convicting
and
incarcerating
these
people
because
the
state
contended
to
uphold
the
segregation
laws
of
the
state
and
if
he
merely
made
a
mistake
of
the
evidence,
we
would
say
that
no
matter
how
long
it
might
be
that
we
would
not
think
he
was
liable
but
where
he
does
it
with
the
intent
as
we
say
for
the
purpose
of
upholding
the
laws,
we
think
that
spelled
out
the
same
thing
that's
going
to
--
it
sums
in
the
trouble
we're
discussing.
the
second
--
i'm
sorry
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
carl
rachlin
mrs.
grayson.
