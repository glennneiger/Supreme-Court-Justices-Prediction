is
that
--
is
that
the
one
about
prosecuting
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
immunity
was
suspended
thereto.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
the
third
circuit
hold
there
that
the
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
an
immunity
because
the
judge
has
decided
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mrs.
grayson
of
what,
under
what
instruction
did
judge
mize
sent
it
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
were
the
instructions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
but
i
wonder,
did
judge
mize
submitted
under
some
instruction
that
if
the
defendant
judge
were
found
guilty
of
corrupt
or
vicious
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bradley
and
fisher
was
in
the
constitutional
position,
was
it?
i
mean
the
immunity
there
was
not
rested
along
the
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
common
law
immunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
under
1983
because
this
had
no
such
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
this
language
that
mr.
rachlin
has
referred
to
us
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
senate
versus
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
did
for
legislators
at
common
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
never
thought
that
it
did
for
judges
at
common
law
would
also
expect
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
leading
a
little
bit
on
the
side
of
the
dissent
in
(inaudible)
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
my
dissent
in
the
opinion
on
the
case.
it
sounds
like
you're
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
true
under
monroe
versus
pape
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
a
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
grayson,
may
ask
this
last
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
asking
us
to
reconsider
monroe
and
pape?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
court
of
appeals
relied
heavily
on
monroe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
--
as
i
read
their
opinion
they
rely
on
monroe
and
pape
in
saying
that
good
faith
is
irrelevant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
in
fact
the
color
of
the
state
statute
would
say
tort
was
valid.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
your
answer
to
me
is
that
you
don't
want
us
to
reconsider
it
just
to
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
misapplied
the
holding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
this
is
to
go
back,
would
you
try
against
the
officer?
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
factual
issue
is
going
to
be
consented
invitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
suggest
that
there
has
to
be
an
addition
of
perhaps
a
reversal
and
affirmance
of
the
district
court
where
the
grounds
that
the
issue
of
probable
cause
was
properly
in
the
case
and
was
properly
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
to
be
a
new
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
