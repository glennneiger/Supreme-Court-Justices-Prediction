justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
alioto,
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
the
evidence.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
on
the
evidence
but
then
we
reached
the
sudden
procedural
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
questions
which
was
in
--
discussed
in
the
last
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
if
we
disagreed
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a
primary
line
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
secondary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
second
--
and
in
secondary
cases
you
have
a
competitive
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
--
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question
before
you
go
on.
the
statute
says
that
that
you
must
prove
discrimination
substantially
less
than
competition
or
injured
competition
with
any
person
who
either
grants
or
knowingly
received
the
benefit
of
the
discrimination.
now,
which
one
are
you
claiming
in
this
case
that
the
evidence
showed?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
last
clause
has
been
eliminated,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
competition
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
--
how
about
the
southern
provision
that
--
would
any
person
--
preventing
competition
with
any
person
who
grants
or
knowingly
received
the
benefits
of
such
discrimination.
you
don't
claim
anything
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
case
is
--
let
me
ask
you
--
do
you
think
the
cases
sustained
the
proposition
that
if
--
that
if
you
can
show
a
substantial
injury
to
say
your
client
that
that
is
enough
to
construe
the
effect
on
competitions
because
it
would
dampen
competition
with
the
person
who
granted
the
discrimination
such
as
safe
--
such
as
pet
or
carnation?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
hurt
--
if
your
client
is
hurt,
why
isn't
the
competition
with
the
grantor,
grantor
the
discrimination
hurt?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
it
makes
great
difference,
we
had
a
cost
injuries
in
this
competition.
mr.
justice
fortas
said
--
asked
you
what
area
are
you
talking
about.
and
if
we
got
to
talk
about
one
area,
you
might
get
one
answer
and
you
might
get
another
in
another
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
--
they
--
you
think
there
are
--
they're
just
simply
wrong
on
historical
facts
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
alioto,
50
(d)
says
that
you
may
when
you're
as
appellee
offers
the
court
of
appeals
grounds
for
new
trial
and
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
the
--
the
penalty
ruling.
now,
let's
assume
that
you
had
after
the
court
of
appeals
such
grounds,
and
the
court
of
appeal
had
reversed
just
as
it
did
here
but
then
it
got
to
your
new
trial
ground
who
said,
"well,
i
think
--
i
think
utah
pie
must
have
a
new
trial
and
the
court
so
ordered
it.
does
he
get
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
--
why
shouldn't
the
trial
court
has
first
cracked
at
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what
you've
been
arguing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
you
do
ask
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
new
trial
in
the
event
they
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this,
it
gets
to
your
new
trial
motion
and
denies
it.
alright,
do
you
think
you
should
be
able
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court
and
ask
the
trial
court
for
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
presumably
but
you
still
think
that
you
have
the
right
to
--
that
the
trial
court
must
entertain
and
pass
on
the
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that's
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
separate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
explain
that
to
me,
will
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
they
are
here
how
can
we
put
it
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
you're
going
to
discuss
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
--
did
utah
however
get
the
safeway
account
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
my
question
so
that
they
--
they
didn't
get
--
they
didn't
--
even
if
continental
went
out
of
the
market,
utah
pie
never
--
was
able
to
sell
pie
to
safeway?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
the
error
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
the
error
in
this
regard
then
made
in
the
trial
court,
how
about
the
instructions?
did
the
instructions
placed
this
theory
before
the
jury
that
do
you
think
it's
de
minimis
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
make
any
(voice
overlap)
did
you
question
the
instructions
in
this
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
all
turned
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
the
ground
on
which
the
--
as
i
understand
it
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
i
didn't
say
there
was
an
error
in
the
instructions
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
different
rule
in
the
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
price
discrimination
here
that
like
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
were
evidence
of
that
--
that
somebody
could
conclude
there
was
a
price
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
that
was
unjustified
by
meeting
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
say
it
was,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
--
what
if
coming
in
with
--
for
two
weeks
it
triggered
a
price
war
and
wherever
it
precluded
the
--
drove
the
prices
down
and
then
know
you
could
never
end
--
nobody
could
get
the
prices
up
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
doesn't
need
before
the
2
(a)
case
doesn't
need
to
prove
conspiracy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes.
and
i'm
saying
that
that
the
discrimination
drove
--
drove
these
whole
pies
price
down
and
they
couldn't
get
them
back
up.
so
that
had
a
continuing
consequence
on
--
on
utah
pie.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
increase
in
volume
doesn't
present
that
--
doesn't
present
damage.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
increase
in
volume
just
might
increase
your
loses.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
your
--
the
position
you've
take
this
almost
saying
that
a
two-week
price
that
can
never
violated
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
fortas
poses
you
one
case
when
you
said
yes
it
could,
now
i'm
just
posing
you
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
it
ruled
them
of
per
se.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
really
is
that
on
this
evidence
that
the
questions
should
never
have
gotten
on
the
jury
against
continental.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
i
understand
that
those
prices
of
yours
are
the
same
all
over
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
was
there
a
discrimination
in
price
between
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
company
between
the
salt
lake
city
market
and
other
markets?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
let's
just
--
let's
just
say
that
--
let's
just
say
that
you
sell
like
$2
a
dozen
in
saint
louis
and
you
sell
it
a
dollar
a
dozen
in
salt
lake
because
there
you
figured
that's
what
it
takes
to
sell
pie
in
salt
lake
city.
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
discrimination
there,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
if
you're
going
to
justify
that
discrimination
and
if
the
burden
is
on
you
to
testify
that
discrimination,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
company
has
--
you
say
that
your
company
has
a
general
policy
of
selling
at
different
prices
in
different
markets
depending
on
what
the
competition
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
you
do
not
now
say
that
you
could
cost
justify
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
--
but
you
do
say
that
you
had
justified
it
by
meeting
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
even
though
you
don't
feel
that
you're
competing
for
any
particular
customers,
that
you're
meeting
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
--
what
is
the
law
in
--
in
robinson-patman
act
cases,
can
you
extend
your
market
with
that
--
with
that
price
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you're
meeting
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
even
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
can
--
then
you
can,
you
--
you
could
--
you
could
even
know
it's
discriminatory
price,
meet
the
price
of
a
competitor
in
order
to
take
his
customer
away
from
it,
if
you
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
take
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
to
what
--
to
what
point
is
this
argument
though
that
there
was
no
damage
to
utah
pie?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
that
there
wasn't
any
discrimination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
that
there
wasn't
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
rule
of
law
that
there
could
never
be
a
rel
--
section
2
(a)
case
made
out
unless
the
defendant
has
met
or
beat
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
to
that
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
prove
that
you
either
met
or
beat
his
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
understand
that
but
--
but
you
don't
say
that
that's
always
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
--
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
say
that
this
is
a
rule
of
law
of
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
depends
on
the
facts
that
are
regained.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
alioto,
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
the
evidence.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
on
the
evidence
but
then
we
reached
the
sudden
procedural
--
justice
byron

white
--
of
questions
which
was
in

discussed
in
the
last
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
if
we
disagreed
on

justice
byron

so
let's
--
justice
byron

white
but
this
is
a

case.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a

justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
second
--
and
in
secondary
cases
you
have
a
competitive

justice

you're

ask

you

with

the

justice
byron

now,
that
it
makes
great

we
had
a

in

competition.
mr.

said

asked

white
--
or
different
rule
in
the
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
price
discrimination
here
that
like
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
were
evidence
of
that
--
that
somebody
could
conclude
there
was
a
price
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
that
was
unjustified
by
meeting
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
say
it
was,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
--
what
if
coming
in
with
--
for
two
weeks
it
triggered
a
price
war
and
wherever
it
precluded
the
--
drove
the
prices
down
and
then
know
you
could
never
end
--
nobody
could
get
the
prices
up
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
doesn't
need
before
the
2
(a)
case
doesn't
need
to
prove
conspiracy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes.
and
i'm
saying
that
that
the
discrimination
drove
--
drove
these
whole
pies
price
down
and
they
couldn't
get
them
back
up.
so
that
had
a
continuing
consequence
on
--
on
utah
pie.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
increase
in
volume
doesn't
present
that
--
doesn't
present
damage.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
increase
in
volume
just
might
increase
your
loses.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
your
--
the
position
you've
take
this
almost
saying
that
a
two-week
price
that
can
never
violated
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
fortas
poses
you
one
case
when
you
said
yes
it
could,
now
i'm
just
posing
you
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
it
ruled
them
of
per
se.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
really
is
that
on
this
evidence
that
the
questions
should
never
have
gotten
on
the
jury
against
continental.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
i
understand
that
those
prices
of
yours
are
the
same
all
over
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
was
there
a
discrimination
in
price
between
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
company
between
the
salt
lake
city
market
and
other
markets?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
let's
just
--
let's
just
say
that
--
let's
just
say
that
you
sell
like
$2
a
dozen
in
saint
louis
and
you
sell
it
a
dollar
a
dozen
in
salt
lake
because
there
you
figured
that's
what
it
takes
to
sell
pie
in
salt
lake
city.
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
discrimination
there,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
if
you're
going
to
justify
that
discrimination
and
if
the
burden
is
on
you
to
testify
that
discrimination,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
company
has
--
you
say
that
your
company
has
a
general
policy
of
selling
at
different
prices
in
different
markets
depending
on
what
the
competition
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
you
do
not
now
say
that
you
could
cost
justify
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
--
but
you
do
say
that
you
had
justified
it
by
meeting
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
even
though
you
don't
feel
that
you're
competing
for
any
particular
customers,
that
you're
meeting
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
--
what
is
the
law
in
--
in
robinson-patman
act
cases,
can
you
extend
your
market
with
that
--
with
that
price
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you're
meeting
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
even
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
can
--
then
you
can,
you
--
you
could
--
you
could
even
know
it's
discriminatory
price,
meet
the
price
of
a
competitor
in
order
to
take
his
customer
away
from
it,
if
you
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
take
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
to
what
--
to
what
point
is
this
argument
though
that
there
was
no
damage
to
utah
pie?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
that
there
wasn't
any
discrimination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
that
there
wasn't
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
rule
of
law
that
there
could
never
be
a
rel
--
section
2
(a)
case
made
out
unless
the
defendant
has
met
or
beat
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
to
that
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
prove
that
you
either
met
or
beat
his
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
understand
that
but
--
but
you
don't
say
that
that's
always
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
--
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
say
that
this
is
a
rule
of
law
of
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
depends
on
the
facts
that
are
regained.
