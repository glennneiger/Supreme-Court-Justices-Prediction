justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
excuse
a
--
aside
from
inferences
from
the
evidence
of
facts
stated
in
the
court's
opinion
which
set
aside
your
judgment.
do
you
challenge
those
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
--
aside
from
inferences,
actual
facts
as
to
conversation
in
letter
and
so
forth
that
took
place,
as
stated
in
the
court's
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
because
i
want
to
know
if
we
can
accept
as
evidence
that
which
is
in
the
court's
opinion
setting
aside
the
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
in
one
reading
that
opinion
could
rely
on
the
interest
of
this
substantial
fact
which
the
court
put
in
there
as
a
reason
for
setting
aside
your
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
talking
about
one
kind
of
written
judgment
on
that
facts
stated
as
to
whether
there
was
a
jury
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
what
substantial
omission
which
might
have
--
have
altered
it
or
might
not,
but
can
one
accept
those
facts
as
substantially
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
judgment
should
be
set
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
been
the
general
policy
of
the
common
law
to
deny
appeal
from
motion
granted
rehearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
motion
to
grant
a
new
trial,
i
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
right,
not
appealable
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
or
not
true
that
frequently
the
question
of
newly
discovered
evidence
requires
an
offering
of
a
new
evidence
in
order
to
show
a
situation
that
had
developed,
what
hadn't
brought
out
in
the
original
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
we
have
to
review
the
motion
for
rehearing,
i
mean
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
customary
that
that's
not
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
rule
50
(d)
--
(d),
a,
b,
c,
d
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
provide
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
grant
a
new
trial
but
does
not
provide,
that
it
cannot
process
that
much
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
would
--
i
would
agree
with
that
but
i'm
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals,
50
(d)
grants
them
specifically
the
right
and
the
power
to
grant
a
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
that's
--
whether
is
binding
or
not?
why
did
it
not
go
further
if
they
intended
to
change
the
common
rule
and
allow
them
power
to
deny
a
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
facts
stated
in
the
court's
opinion
which
you
object?
justice
hugo
l.
black
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
object
to
the
court's
statement
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question
about
the
court's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
one
would
read
the
facts
stated
in
the
court's
opinion
and
reach
the
conclusion
that
those
facts
are
true
that
there
was
a
disputed
question
to
go
before
the
juries,
would
they
have
to
read
in
the
verdict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
consensus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
excuse
a

aside
from
inferences
from
the
evidence
of
facts
stated
