justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
mr.
alioto
was
there
any
difference
in
your
opinion
between
the
counsels
as
to
what
should
be
the
credit
for
purposes
with
this
court's
review?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it's
agreed
by
both
sides
that
you
cannot.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
just
feel
real
sorry
for
whoever
has
to
pay
that
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
you
did
not
apply
for
certiorari
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
--
when
you
say
pie
business,
do
i
also
understand
frozen
pie.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
remind
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
remind
me
mr.
alioto
how
far
did
you
talk
of
pie
sell
as
far
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
these
figures
you
gave
us
just
a
moment
ago
applied
to
this
area
that
you've
known
this
time.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
is
the
--
some,
you
can
excuse
an
expression,
what
is
the
geographic
market
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
record
does
contain
market
share
figures
as
to
that
geographic?
justice
abe
fortas
just
as
to
what
area
then?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
--
the
gravamen
of
your
complaint
must
be
based
on
utah
and
southern
idaho.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
then
maybe
that
the
purposes
of
measuring
anti-competitive
effects
and
the
competitor
potential
under
the
2
(a),
your
standards
maybe
different
and
they
are
in
the
sherman
act
case.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
even
receiving
the
section
7
case
should
have
to
show
something
about
market
share,
i
should
think
at
least
its
convention.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
they
made
millions
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
that
it
made
millions
on
its
frozen
fruit
pies.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
whether
it
made
money
generally
on
its
fruit
pies?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
distinction
in
the
price
which
it
sold
and
which
pet
sold
in
the
geographic
area
here
involved,
and
that
which
it
sold
nationally?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
pet-ritz
was
sold
in
which
it
caused
utah
trading
area
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
means
the
core
of
the
geographic
market
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
pet-ritz
was
sold
in
that
utah
trading
area
at
a
lower
price
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
sold
in
california
where
pet
has
a
plant.
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
utah
plant
make
a
price
concession
as
safeway
too?
justice
abe
fortas
had
safeway
been
buying
the
price
from
utah?
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
lose
the
pumpkin
pie
and
mince
pie
business
too?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
they
also
engage
in
price
discrimination,
area
price
discrimination
with
respect
to
where
you
call
that
swiss
miss?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
your
point
then
must
be
that
whereas
another
areas,
pet
kind
of
controlled
a
percentage
of
the
market
that
was
taken
by
trying
to
seduce
the
market
by
taking
swiss
miss
here,
so
they
make
that
up,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
does
your
view
concede
that
the
element
of
intent
is
necessary?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
net,
net
of
it
is
that
--
of
our
problem
one
aspect
then
to
ask,
you
have
a
national
company
and
that
has
fruit
pie,
frozen
fruit
pie,
and
it
is
not
in
the
utah
area
and
it
decides
to
enter
the
utah
area.
can
it
or
can
it
not
enter
the
utah
area
on
the
basis
of
a
somewhat
lower
price
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
brand
or
getting
brand
acceptance
in
that
area?
and
you
say
that
in
this
situation
it
did
so
and
it
did
so
with
the
intent
and
effect
of
injuring
a
competitor
namely
utah
pie
that
had
an
established
position
in
the
market.
justice
abe
fortas
2
(a)
means
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
got
some
technical
problems.
you
have
some
technical
problems
about
2
(a),
don't
you?
not
2
(a)
was
confined
in
situations
where
sales
were
made
to
one
person
at
a
lower
price
and
to
his
competitor.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
part
of
--
was
that
active
onset
of
safeway's
entry
into
the
market
here?
justice
abe
fortas
or
morton,
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
now
(voice
overlap)
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
that
are
these
prices
$4
and
$3
that
refer
to
growth
prices
that
is
saved
before
advertising
allowances
and
other
types
of
allowances.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
have
to
be
weary
in
the
use
of
that
$4
figure
and
then
maybe
that
is
subject
to
reduction.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
arguable,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
say
there
are
--
there
maybe
--
there
may
have
been
some
advertising
allowances
in
california
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
abe
fortas
that
were
not
equal
to
advertising
allowances
in
utah,
is
that
right?
so
that
these
are
not
totally
comparable
figures
if
you
include
advertising
allowances
justice
abe
fortas
the
record
shows
how
much
the
advertising
allowances
in
california
were.
justice
abe
fortas
about
how
much
did
they
run
per
case?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
as
much
as
a
dollar,
50
cents,
25
cents?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
any
question
is
there
about
the
intent
of
the
court
of
appeals
here.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
of
course
remanded
with
instructions
to
enter
judgment
for
the
defendants.
now,
what
you're
saying
--
well,
i
--
i
should
think
that
would
be
a
reasonably
clear
indication
of
their
intent,
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
why
--
why
do
you
say
that
the
way
--
did
we
limit
the
grant?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
heard
--
you
heard
some
colloquy
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
well,
sometimes
we
don't
--
we
don't
do
exactly
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
have
a
plant
there?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
--
that
--
are
you
telling
us
that
the
computation
of
cost
did
not
permitted
economic
of
delivery
of
those
pies
from
the
watsonville
plant
to
the
utah
market?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
asked
you,
you
--
you
said
that
continental
had
no
market
position
in
competition
with
utah
pie.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
said
that
--
but
what
--
and
i
asked
you
about
the
plant.
where
was
their
nearest
plant
to
make
frozen
pies?
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
--
why
are
you
saying
that,
i'm
sorry
but
i
don't
follow
you.
as
i
understand
you
now
what
you're
saying
is
and
nothing
more
than
that
--
you're
client
did
not
have
a
plant
within
--
prior
to
1961,
this
story
begins
as
i
understand
it.
it
--
that
client
did
not
have
a
plant
from
which
it
could
supply
product
into
the
utah
market
on
competitive
basis,
is
there
anything
more
than
that
where
i
have
missed
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
it's
like
--
what
--
what
is
--
what
declining
cost,
declining
prices
in
utah?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
--
what
claim,
what
cost?
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
from
which
--
from
which
plant
would
you
think
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
were
in
your
example.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
mr.
alioto
said
that
it
was
six
weeks
and
again
i
misunderstood
him.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
look.
what
happened
after
the
two
weeks?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
continental
went
out
of
--
out
of
the
business
in
that
market?
justice
abe
fortas
huh?
justice
abe
fortas
continental?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
get
back
to
it.
give
me,
slowing
you
down
here.
continental
entered
this
market
in
which
you
talk
pie
was
offered
anything
and
accorded
the
low
price
to
safeway.
justice
abe
fortas
everybody
for
six
weeks,
for
two
weeks
you
say.
and
safeway
bought
six-week
supplies,
aren't
you
telling
us
then?
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
that
six
weeks
plan
for
all
of
the
safeway
divisions
in
the
utah
market?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
at
the
end
of
the
two
weeks,
continental
raised
its
price?
justice
abe
fortas
well
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
you
answered
trying
to
get
it.
justice
abe
fortas
it
went
in
of
the
market
with
a
low
price
and
they
sold
to
safeway
and
they
sold
the
six-week
supply,
at
the
end
of
the
two
weeks
promotion
period
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
then
continental
raised
its
price.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
does
the
record
show
about
what
happened
to
utah
pie
during
this
period?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
price
during
the
two
weeks
promotion?
justice
abe
fortas
$2.85
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
the
bigger
pie.
what
was
continental's
price?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
continental's
price?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
after
continental
had
made
its
deal
with
safeway?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
--
if
you're
putting
yourself
as
problem
that
arises
with
respect
to
a
price
cut
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
entry
into
a
new
market,
i
think
we've
got
--
that
that's
a
very
in
--
to
me
that's
a
very
interesting
problem.
but
if
you're
arguing
here
about
did
they
or
did
they
not
reduce
the
price
for
the
--
with
or
without
the
effect
of
--
of
still
applying
utah
pie's
competition
or
the
competition
of
catering
anybody
else
here
with
it's
different
price
in
that.
that's
what
i
like
to
know,
what
is
the
basis
of
--
of
your
discourse
here?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out.
and
now
is
there
--
are
there
any
cases
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
no
cases
with
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
no
cases
in
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
narrowed
question
then
that
this
problem
puts
is
whether
there
is
a
requisite
prospective
effect,
present
or
prospective
effect
on
competition.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
arguing
is
that
this
was
all
de
minimis
as
shown
by
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
record
show
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
suppose
the
record
shows
that
a
two
weeks
promotion
during
which
six-week
supply
of
product
asked
were
sold
to
a
great
chain
store
resulted
in
driving
a
company
out
of
business,
would
that
give
you
the
requisite
competitive
effect
under
the
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
your
--
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
case
to
make
that
clear,
but
how
about
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
your
position
is
that
even
if
a
price
distinction
--
let
me
put
it
that
way
under
2
(a)
results
in
driving
a
significant
competitor
totally
out
of
business,
if
that
doesn't
sound
the
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
don't
have
the
ca
--
you
don't
have
the
case
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
show
--
you
have
to
show
damage
to
competition
whatever
that
concept
may
mean.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
question
you're
asking.
justice
abe
fortas
all
that
result
in
driving
a
competitor
out
of
business.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
think
that
driving
a
competitor
out
of
business
and
your
--
your
position
as
i
understand
you
is
that
that
would
not
make
up
the
case
under
2
(a).
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
very
well
would
be
assuming
that
this
goes
to
say
you
drive
one
of
my
business.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
your
--
your
position
is
that
would
and
they
--
you
have
13
before
and
13
after?
would
that
then
make
out
of
violation,
it
does
not
make
out
a
violation
with
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
what?
we
look
at
the
statement
of
facts
in
volume
15
of
the
record
and
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
basis,
what
part
of
the
court
of
appeals,
in
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence,
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
correct
judgment
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
how
can
we
do
that
without
looking
at
the
evidence.
i
may
have
fallen
off
your
bicycle
here.
i
don't
understand
how
we
can
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
concluding
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
unless
we
look
at
the
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
--
maybe
there's
some
principle
here
that
i'm
missing.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
a
great
difference
between
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
evidence
for
example,
your
opponent
was
very
careful
to
say
and
very
insistent
that
there
are
other
facts
and
you
think
some
of
it
would
be
taken
into
account.
but
however
that
may
be,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
can
take
the
statements
of
counsel,
it
even
looks
suppose
the
counsel
on
both
sides
as
--
as
to
the
facts
and
that
that
one
relieve
us
of
a
necessity
of
looking
at
the
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
a
very
welcomed
principle
and
--
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
familiar
with
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
though
it
did,
he
did.
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
the
limited
time
here
i
thought
he
pointed
--
tried
to
point
some
out
and
also
got
to
try
to
point
some
more
out
on
his
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
billings,
that
table
--
that
chart
in
the
tables
on
13
and
14,
did
they
reflect
your
actual
selling
prices
or
do
they
include
deals
that
you
may
have
made
the
safeway
or
others?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
you
mean
the
deals
are
included
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
because
your
second
footnote
does
not
indicate
that
to
me
on
page
13
of
your
brief.
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
want
to
know
whether
these
are
the
actual
selling
price,
these
prices
for
example
which
is
sold
to
the
large
chains.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we're
not
here
talking
about
a
promotional
price
reduction.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
in
connection
in
the
continental
argument
they're
just
pertinent,
the
court
words
it
this
was
a
--
they
were
selling
at
a
promotional
price
in
order
to
gain
market
acceptance.
justice
abe
fortas
but
no
such
situation
is
presented
here
with
respect
to
carnation,
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
in
other
words
they
are
your
usual
ordinary
customary
prices
minus
whatever
you
take
off
to
arrive
at
your
promotional
prices.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
that.
these
are
generalizations
then,
are
they
not
averages,
the
figures
on
that
tables
one
and
two
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
the
figures
reflected
on
that
chart?
justice
abe
fortas
as
an
average
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
points
of
time
within
these
months
when
the
prices
were
lower
than
the
prices
here
stated,
that's
from
the
time
you
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
isn't
that
what
pet
did
too?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
they
brought
out
a
lower
priced
pie?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
you
stated
mr.
lamb
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
brought
a
--
you
said
they
did
that
in
the
context
of
the
competition
which
they
had
to
meet
from
a
lot
of
small
pie
companies.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i'm
getting
that
--
getting
that
far
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
getting
that
far
as
against
the
small
companies.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
who
--
the
swiss
miss
was
a
smaller
pie
than
utah?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
priced
below
utah
but
you
say
that
when
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
try
to
factor
it
out
and
that
brings
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
close
to
utah.
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
its
real
significance
is
that
it
shows
an
awareness
as
a
competitor
of
this
particular
plaintiff
as
bearing
upon
the
whether
the
effect
or
whatever
happened
here
a)
was
directive
and
b)
had
a
direct
impact
upon
the
plaintiff
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand,
i
understand
but
i
--
its
problem
takes
a
lot
of
dif
--
may
take
a
little
different
aspect
when
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
judicial
dynamics
and
the
question
is
this
was
something
that
might
not
impress
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
know
sitting
up
here.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
mr.
alioto
was
there
any
difference
in
your
opinion
between
the
counsels
as
to
what
should
be
the
credit
for
purposes
with
this
court's
review?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it's
agreed
by
both
sides
that
you
cannot.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
just
feel
real
sorry
for
whoever
has
to
pay
that
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
you
did
not
apply
for
certiorari
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
--
when
you
say
pie
business,
do
i
also
understand
frozen
pie.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
remind
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
remind
me
mr.
alioto
how
far
did
you
talk
of
pie
sell
as
far
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
these
figures
you
gave
us
just
a
moment
ago
applied
to
this
area
that
you've
known
this
time.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
is
the
--
some,
you
can
excuse
an
expression,
what
is
the
geographic
market
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
record
does
contain
market
share
figures
as
to
that
geographic?
justice
abe
fortas
just
as
to
what
area
then?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
--
the
gravamen
of
your
complaint
must
be
based
on
utah
and
southern
idaho.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
then
maybe
that
the
purposes
of
measuring
anti-competitive
effects
and
the
competitor
potential
under
the
2
(a),
your
standards
maybe
different
and
they
are
in
the
sherman
act
case.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
even
receiving
the
section
7
case
should
have
to
show
something
about
market
share,
i
should
think
at
least
its
convention.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
they
made
millions
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
that
it
made
millions
on
its
frozen
fruit
pies.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
whether
it
made
money
generally
on
its
fruit
pies?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
distinction
in
the
price
which
it
sold
and
which
pet
sold
in
the
geographic
area
here
involved,
and
that
which
it
sold
nationally?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
pet-ritz
was
sold
in
which
it
caused
utah
trading
area
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
means
the
core
of
the
geographic
market
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
pet-ritz
was
sold
in
that
utah
trading
area
at
a
lower
price
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
sold
in
california
where
pet
has
a
plant.
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
utah
plant
make
a
price
concession
as
safeway
too?
justice
abe
fortas
had
safeway
been
buying
the
price
from
utah?
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
lose
the
pumpkin
pie
and
mince
pie
business
too?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
they
also
engage
in
price
discrimination,
area
price
discrimination
with
respect
to
where
you
call
that
swiss
miss?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
your
point
then
must
be
that
whereas
another
areas,
pet
kind
of
controlled
a
percentage
of
the
market
that
was
taken
by
trying
to
seduce
the
market
by
taking
swiss
miss
here,
so
they
make
that
up,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
does
your
view
concede
that
the
element
of
intent
is
necessary?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
net,
net
of
it
is
that
--
of
our
problem
one
aspect
then
to
ask,
you
have
a
national
company
and
that
has
fruit
pie,
frozen
fruit
pie,
and
it
is
not
in
the
utah
area
and
it
decides
to
enter
the
utah
area.
can
it
or
can
it
not
enter
the
utah
area
on
the
basis
of
a
somewhat
lower
price
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
brand
or
getting
brand
acceptance
in
that
area?
and
you
say
that
in
this
situation
it
did
so
and
it
did
so
with
the
intent
and
effect
of
injuring
a
competitor
namely
utah
pie
that
had
an
established
position
in
the
market.
justice
abe
fortas
2
(a)
means
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
got
some
technical
problems.
you
have
some
technical
problems
about
2
(a),
don't
you?
not
2
(a)
was
confined
in
situations
where
sales
were
made
to
one
person
at
a
lower
price
and
to
his
competitor.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
part
of
--
was
that
active
onset
of
safeway's
entry
into
the
market
here?
justice
abe
fortas
or
morton,
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
now
(voice
overlap)
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
that
are
these
prices
$4
and
$3
that
refer
to
growth
prices
that
is
saved
before
advertising
allowances
and
other
types
of
allowances.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
have
to
be
weary
in
the
use
of
that
$4
figure
and
then
maybe
that
is
subject
to
reduction.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
arguable,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
say
there
are
--
there
maybe
--
there
may
have
been
some
advertising
allowances
in
california
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
abe
fortas
that
were
not
equal
to
advertising
allowances
in
utah,
is
that
right?
so
that
these
are
not
totally
comparable
figures
if
you
include
advertising
allowances
justice
abe
fortas
the
record
shows
how
much
the
advertising
allowances
in
california
were.
justice
abe
fortas
about
how
much
did
they
run
per
case?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
as
much
as
a
dollar,
50
cents,
25
cents?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
any
question
is
there
about
the
intent
of
the
court
of
appeals
here.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
of
course
remanded
with
instructions
to
enter
judgment
for
the
defendants.
now,
what
you're
saying
--
well,
i
--
i
should
think
that
would
be
a
reasonably
clear
indication
of
their
intent,
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
why
--
why
do
you
say
that
the
way
--
did
we
limit
the
grant?
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
heard
--
you
heard
some
colloquy
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
well,
sometimes
we
don't
--
we
don't
do
exactly
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
they
have
a
plant
there?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
--
that
--
are
you
telling
us
that
the
computation
of
cost
did
not
permitted
economic
of
delivery
of
those
pies
from
the
watsonville
plant
to
the
utah
market?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
asked
you,
you
--
you
said
that
continental
had
no
market
position
in
competition
with
utah
pie.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
said
that
--
but
what
--
and
i
asked
you
about
the
plant.
where
was
their
nearest
plant
to
make
frozen
pies?
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
--
why
are
you
saying
that,
i'm
sorry
but
i
don't
follow
you.
as
i
understand
you
now
what
you're
saying
is
and
nothing
more
than
that
--
you're
client
did
not
have
a
plant
within
--
prior
to
1961,
this
story
begins
as
i
understand
it.
it
--
that
client
did
not
have
a
plant
from
which
it
could
supply
product
into
the
utah
market
on
competitive
basis,
is
there
anything
more
than
that
where
i
have
missed
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
it's
like
--
what
--
what
is
--
what
declining
cost,
declining
prices
in
utah?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
--
what
claim,
what
cost?
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
from
which
--
from
which
plant
would
you
think
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
were
in
your
example.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
mr.
alioto
said
that
it
was
six
weeks
and
again
i
misunderstood
him.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
look.
what
happened
after
the
two
weeks?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
continental
went
out
of
--
out
of
the
business
in
that
market?
justice
abe
fortas
huh?
justice
abe
fortas
continental?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
get
back
to
it.
give
me,
slowing
you
down
here.
continental
entered
this
market
in
which
you
talk
pie
was
offered
anything
and
accorded
the
low
price
to
safeway.
justice
abe
fortas
everybody
for
six
weeks,
for
two
weeks
you
say.
and
safeway
bought
six-week
supplies,
aren't
you
telling
us
then?
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
that
six
weeks
plan
for
all
of
the
safeway
divisions
in
the
utah
market?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
at
the
end
of
the
two
weeks,
continental
raised
its
price?
justice
abe
fortas
well
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
you
answered
trying
to
get
it.
justice
abe
fortas
it
went
in
of
the
market
with
a
low
price
and
they
sold
to
safeway
and
they
sold
the
six-week
supply,
at
the
end
of
the
two
weeks
promotion
period
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
then
continental
raised
its
price.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
does
the
record
show
about
what
happened
to
utah
pie
during
this
period?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
price
during
the
two
weeks
promotion?
justice
abe
fortas
$2.85
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
the
bigger
pie.
what
was
continental's
price?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
continental's
price?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
after
continental
had
made
its
deal
with
safeway?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
--
if
you're
putting
yourself
as
problem
that
arises
with
respect
to
a
price
cut
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
entry
into
a
new
market,
i
think
we've
got
--
that
that's
a
very
in
--
to
me
that's
a
very
interesting
problem.
but
if
you're
arguing
here
about
did
they
or
did
they
not
reduce
the
price
for
the
--
with
or
without
the
effect
of
--
of
still
applying
utah
pie's
competition
or
the
competition
of
catering
anybody
else
here
with
it's
different
price
in
that.
that's
what
i
like
to
know,
what
is
the
basis
of
--
of
your
discourse
here?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out.
and
now
is
there
--
are
there
any
cases
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
no
cases
with
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
no
cases
in
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
narrowed
question
then
that
this
problem
puts
is
whether
there
is
a
requisite
prospective
effect,
present
or
prospective
effect
on
competition.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
arguing
is
that
this
was
all
de
minimis
as
shown
by
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
record
show
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
suppose
the
record
shows
that
a
two
weeks
promotion
during
which
six-week
supply
of
product
asked
were
sold
to
a
great
chain
store
resulted
in
driving
a
company
out
of
business,
would
that
give
you
the
requisite
competitive
effect
under
the
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
your
--
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
case
to
make
that
clear,
but
how
about
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
your
position
is
that
even
if
a
price
distinction
--
let
me
put
it
that
way
under
2
(a)
results
in
driving
a
significant
competitor
totally
out
of
business,
if
that
doesn't
sound
the
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
don't
have
the
ca
--
you
don't
have
the
case
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
show
--
you
have
to
show
damage
to
competition
whatever
that
concept
may
mean.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
question
you're
asking.
justice
abe
fortas
all
that
result
in
driving
a
competitor
out
of
business.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
think
that
driving
a
competitor
out
of
business
and
your
--
your
position
as
i
understand
you
is
that
that
would
not
make
up
the
case
under
2
(a).
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
very
well
would
be
assuming
that
this
goes
to
say
you
drive
one
of
my
business.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
your
--
your
position
is
that
would
and
they
--
you
have
13
before
and
13
after?
would
that
then
make
out
of
violation,
it
does
not
make
out
a
violation
with
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
what?
we
look
at
the
statement
of
facts
in
volume
15
of
the
record
and
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
basis,
what
part
of
the
court
of
appeals,
in
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence,
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
correct
judgment
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
how
can
we
do
that
without
looking
at
the
evidence.
i
may
have
fallen
off
your
bicycle
here.
i
don't
understand
how
we
can
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
concluding
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
unless
we
look
at
the
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
--
maybe
there's
some
principle
here
that
i'm
missing.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
a
great
difference
between
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
evidence
for
example,
your
opponent
was
very
careful
to
say
and
very
insistent
that
there
are
other
facts
and
you
think
some
of
it
would
be
taken
into
account.
but
however
that
may
be,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
can
take
the
statements
of
counsel,
it
even
looks
suppose
the
counsel
on
both
sides
as
--
as
to
the
facts
and
that
that
one
relieve
us
of
a
necessity
of
looking
at
the
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
a
very
welcomed
principle
and
--
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
familiar
with
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
though
it
did,
he
did.
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
the
limited
time
here
i
thought
he
pointed
--
tried
to
point
some
out
and
also
got
to
try
to
point
some
more
out
on
his
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
billings,
that
table
--
that
chart
in
the
tables
on
13
and
14,
did
they
reflect
your
actual
selling
prices
or
do
they
include
deals
that
you
may
have
made
the
safeway
or
others?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
you
mean
the
deals
are
included
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
because
your
second
footnote
does
not
indicate
that
to
me
on
page
13
of
your
brief.
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
want
to
know
whether
these
are
the
actual
selling
price,
these
prices
for
example
which
is
sold
to
the
large
chains.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we're
not
here
talking
about
a
promotional
price
reduction.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
in
connection
in
the
continental
argument
they're
just
pertinent,
the
court
words
it
this
was
a
--
they
were
selling
at
a
promotional
price
in
order
to
gain
market
acceptance.
justice
abe
fortas
but
no
such
situation
is
presented
here
with
respect
to
carnation,
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
in
other
words
they
are
your
usual
ordinary
customary
prices
minus
whatever
you
take
off
to
arrive
at
your
promotional
prices.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
that.
these
are
generalizations
then,
are
they
not
averages,
the
figures
on
that
tables
one
and
two
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
the
figures
reflected
on
that
chart?
justice
abe
fortas
as
an
average
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
points
of
time
within
these
months
when
the
prices
were
lower
than
the
prices
here
stated,
that's
from
the
time
you
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
isn't
that
what
pet
did
too?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
they
brought
out
a
lower
priced
pie?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
you
stated
mr.
lamb
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
brought
a
--
you
said
they
did
that
in
the
context
of
the
competition
which
they
had
to
meet
from
a
lot
of
small
pie
companies.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i'm
getting
that
--
getting
that
far
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
getting
that
far
as
against
the
small
companies.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
who
--
the
swiss
miss
was
a
smaller
pie
than
utah?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
priced
below
utah
but
you
say
that
when
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
try
to
factor
it
out
and
that
brings
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
close
to
utah.
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
its
real
significance
is
that
it
shows
an
awareness
as
a
competitor
of
this
particular
plaintiff
as
bearing
upon
the
whether
the
effect
or
whatever
happened
here
a)
was
directive
and
b)
had
a
direct
impact
upon
the
plaintiff
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand,
i
understand
but
i
--
its
problem
takes
a
lot
of
dif
--
may
take
a
little
different
aspect
when
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
judicial
dynamics
and
the
question
is
this
was
something
that
might
not
impress
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
as
to
know
sitting
up
here.
