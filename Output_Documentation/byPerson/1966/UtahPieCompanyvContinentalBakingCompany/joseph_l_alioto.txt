mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
private
anti
trust
suit.
in
the
trial
court,
the
petitioner,
the
utah
pie
company
won
the
verdicts.
and
a
judgment
was
entered
on
that
verdict
of
$350,000.
in
addition
to
winning
the
verdict,
it
also
secured
from
the
trial
court
a
decree
which
prohibited
the
respondents
from
charging
a
lower
price
for
the
product
in
the
trading
area
of
the
petitioner
than
a
charge
in
those
states
of
california
and
iowa,
respectively,
where
the
respondents
had
their
plants.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
respondents
timely,
made
timely
motions
for
directed
verdicts.
those
motions
were
reserved.
after
the
jury
verdict
and
the
entry
of
the
judgment
for
the
petition,
the
respondents
made
motions
for
judgment
n.
o.
v.
and
motions
for
a
new
trial.
the
trial
courts
denied
both
of
those
motions.
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
wiped
out
the
judgment
for
money
damages
and
it
wiped
out
the
decree
for
injunctive
relief
and
in
the
course
of
doing
it
said
that
the
cause
should
be
remanded
to
the
dis
--
to
the
district
court
with
a
direction
"to
enter
judgment
for
defendants,"
that
was
the
direction.
a
ground
relied
upon
the
court
of
appeals
for
reversal
of
both
the
money
judgment
and
the
decree
was
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
findings,
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
and
the
judgment
that
was
entered
on
that
verdict.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
there
were
separate
verdicts
justice
stewart.
the
verdict
against
the
continental
company
was
for
$88,000,
the
verdict
against
the
pet
company
was
for
a
$152,000,
the
verdict
against
carnation
was
for
$93,000,
and
then
the
--
the
decree
ran
separately
in
effect
as
to
each
of
them.
in
the
original
complaint,
there
was
a
cost
stated
for
section
1
of
the
--
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
a
cost
stated
under
2
(a)
separately.
what
we
in
effect
said
is
that
the
discriminatory
price
was
brought
about
as
the
result
of
some
cooperation
among
three
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
respondents.
but
we
made
it
clear
and
the
trial
court
made
it
clear
that
in
the
event
the
jury
found
on
both
counts
that
the
petitioner
wouldn't
get
the
damages
from
both
but
that
the
court
would
select
one
or
the
other
so
there
was
not
much
of
an
overlap.
nevertheless,
the
--
the
verdict
and
the
judgments
were
a
separate
verdict
and
judgments
because
the
jury
found
for
us
on
the
--
on
the
2
(a)
question.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
for
separate
amounts
against
each
of
them
and
for
separate
litigation
expenses
as
i
had
given
them
to
the
court.
that
is
correct.
the
three
of
them
aggregated
approximately
350.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
after
the
judge
had
covered
the
amount
on
the
jury's
verdict,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
represent
the
trebling
by
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
well,
the
actual
--
the
actual
breakdown
justice
stewart
is
as
against
continental,
$74,000
and
$14,000
for
litigation
expenses,
totaling
88,
as
against
pet,
$44,000
which
was
trebled
to
a
$132,000
and
$20,000
for
litigation
expenses,
as
against
carnation,
trebled
the
amount
of
$87,000
with
$16,000
for
litigation
expenses.
now,
actually
all
that
was
done
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
to
take
a
$50,000
attorney
fee
awarded
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
then
allocated
of
course
to
the
amount
of
the
judge.
it
was
an
allocation
made
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
the
way,
that's
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
both
the
money
award
and
the
decree
on
the
ground
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
the
prohibited
effect.
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
of
injury
to
competition.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
it
was
determined
as
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
that's
correct
sir.
however,
it
doesn't
mean
that
in
determining
the
situation
with
respect
to
one
that
you
have
to
ignore
the
evidence
after
the
evidence.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
competitive
picture
as
a
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
they
can
be
separately
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
it
had
gone
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no.
you
don't
have
to
read
all
of
that
at
all.
they're
the
first
three
volumes
of
all
of
the
testimony.
the
briefs
then
make
a
specific
record
as
to
that
record
and
all
it
really
has
to
be
read
in
those
briefs
in
those
first
three
volumes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
one
of
the
very
expensive
thing,
if
your
honor
please,
it
cost
the
petitioner
50,000
--
$50,000.
but
the
only
question
here
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
the
issues
--
the
issues
for
the
court,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
sufficient
and
this
was
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
--
to
the
jury.
now,
as
just
a
practical
matter,
there
were
some
problems
about
cooperation
among
counsel
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
because
that
leads
to
incriminations.
and
i
think
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
contributed
to
this
record
being
as
long
as
it
was.
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
present
whether
there
are
three,
four,
five
volumes
of
nothing
but
invoices.
and
then
you
have
to
look
at
all
those
invoices,
we
have
made
a
table
of
the
invoices
as
a
matter
of
appendices
in
our
brief.
now,
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
--
and
we
have
documented
that
data
to
every
invoice
in
the
record
that
if
there's
any
question
about
whether
our
statement
is
correct,
it
is
there
and
since
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
--
i
don't
recall
any
difference
to
these
opinions
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
believe
that
is
the
situation.
however,
as
i
say
don't
think
anybody,
you
have
to
reorder
all
those
invoices.
we
have
simply
documented
them
and
let
them
there
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
presented
to
that
jury
is
the
issue
--
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
we
--
we
are
--
we
are
hopeful
of
course.
if
in
terms
of
enforcement
and
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
that
private
litigation
in
the
antitrust
laws
that
i
think
that
had
some
--
some
important
here,
but
as
i
say
an
explanation
of
why
it
was
necessary
to
print
all
that
i
think
involves
a
question
of
whether
there
were
certain
cooperation
between
counsel
at
the
trial
level
and
the
--
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
probable
to
get
in
--
into
that
question
at
the
moment.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
i
think
it's
all
done
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
no.
nothing
says
that
have
to
be
done
mr.
justice
brennan
but
there
was
a
certain
cloudiness
about
this
whole
question
about
when
you
present
tabulations
even
in
the
trial
court
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
to
have
all
of
the
underlying
records
there.
now,
the
decisions
go
both
ways
on
them
and
until
it's
definitely
clarified,
i
think
a
plaintiff
particularly
at
a
certain
cert
i
think
a
plaintiff
has
to
do
it
safely.
and
if
he
has
4000
invoices
and
he
has
a
tabulation
as
we've
had
this
case,
on
those
invoices,
it
might
be
alright
to
put
the
tabulation
in
and
leave
the
invoices
out.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
then
get
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
if
the
underlying
documents
aren't
here
then
they
fully
rejected
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
made
an
attempt
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
made
an
attempt
to
file
an
--
to
file
the
invoices
as
original
records
in
this
court
and
as
i
understand
that
from
my
associates
that
there
was
correspondence
or
some
conversation
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
on
this
matter.
as
i
understand
it
from
my
associates
the
view
was
taken
that
they
couldn't
be
filed
as
original
records
because
they
were
photostat
or
which
is
more
convenient
we
use
photostats
of
these
invoices
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
we
didn't
apply
it
to
the
court.
we
did
talk
about
them
and
we
did
talk
about
this
matter
with
the
clerk.
and
the
clerk
indicated
we
could
then
file
them
as
original
--
as
original
document
and
i
don't
believe
that
our
--
that
we
did
apply
it
to
court.
however,
i
--
i
do
point
out
that
you
don't
have
to
read
the
whole
of
the
record.
if
that
is
documented
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
we
try
to
get
this
in
as
original
records.
as
i
say
under
your
rules
and
perhaps
it
was
to
the
deficiency
on
our
part
that
we
dealt
with
the
clerk
rather
than
with
the
court.
and
then
i
have
to
say
that
no
question
about
any
--
any
--
the
cor
--
for
the
great
courtesy
we'd
had
from
the
clerk
that
he
was
perhaps
right
in
interpreting
the
rule
as
he
saw
at
that
time,
his
understanding
of
it.
the
court
of
appeals
took
88
pages
breaking
a
volume,
took
88
pages,
printed
pages,
in
order
to
tell
us
that
we
didn't
have
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
apparent
just
from
reading
the
88
pages
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
were
some
wrestling
with
facts
and
some
resolution
of
factual
issues
where
there
was
rather
sharp
conflict
in
the
evidence.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
enters
this
judgment
in
may
of
1965.
we
applied
the
certiorari
in
august
of
1965
and
it
was
granted.
the
--
all
of
the
petition
was
granted
and
we
simply
asked
a
review
on
the
basic
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
had
just
served
that
function
of
the
jury
in
this
case.
and
the
court
added
the
procedural
points
involved
in
the
judgment
n.
o.
v.
and
the
applicability
of
rule,
rule
15.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
three
national
large
corporations,
the
pet
milk
company,
the
carnation
company,
and
the
continental
baking
company.
this
is
a
section
2
(a)
primary,
line
price
discrimination
case.
it
was
brought
by
the
petitioner
against
the
competitors,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
the
conspiracy
account
was
rejected
by
the
jury.
in
addition
to
that,
the
respondent,
continental
had
a
--
and
this
is
important
point
when
we
come
to
consider
the
procedural
issue.
now,
the
counterclaim
against
the
petitioner
in
which
the
licensed
petitioner
had
violated
section
2
(a)
to
its
damage,
the
jury
agreed
and
said
that
the
petitioner
have
in
fact
violated
section
2
(a)
to
its
damage
and
awarded
damages
of
one
dollar
to
the
respondent
continental.
we
made
a
motion
for
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
the
trial
court
who
granted
that
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
was
error
and
remanded
that
case
for
a
new
trial.
that,
however,
is
not
before
this
court;
the
only
thing
that
is
before
this
court
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
for
two-way
and
the
procedural
points
that
have
been
raised.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
other
two
did
not
file
a
counterclaim,
just
continental
and
they
got
a
dollar
from
the
jury,
the
trial
court
granted
a
motion
n.
o.
v.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
it
and
come
down
on
the
ground
of
no
motion
for
a
directive
verdict
as
they
say.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
or
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
now,
that's
not
before
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
before
this.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
on
that,
we
did
not.
i
think
that
was
just
a
factual
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
injurious
impact
shown
even
conceding
the
violation
and
the
--
the
trial
court
ruled
down
that
ground
that
even
conceding
the
violation
of
no
injurious
impact
on
the
respondents.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
we
hope
that
you
will
never
have
to
reach
that
point
if
perhaps
therefore
we
weren't
the
best
advocates
on
that
point
that
we
--
we
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
point.
in
this
case,
we
are
prepared
to
discuss
--
that
will
discuss
it.
so
as
we
have
some
views
about
the
matter.
and
so
far
as
the
factual
situation,
i'm
not
going
to
detail
the
facts
but
simply
to
give
you
the
ultimate,
the
highlights
of
what
was
proven
in
this
record
because
i
think
it
clearly,
under
any
kind
of
fact,
it's
clearly
sufficient
to
have
stand
the
verdict
of
this
jury.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
small
family
enterprise
then
operating
in
the
intermountain
area
for
some
30
years.
the
respondents
on
the
other
hand
are
all
national
concerns
and
the
product
we're
talking
about
is
frozen
pie.
the
frozen
pie
business
meant
little
if
anything
to
this
national
concerns.
it
was
a
small
part
of
what
they
did.
but
so
far
as
its
petitioner
was
concerned,
it
was
everything
of
what
this
is.
the
petitioner
started
in
the
pie
business,
then
when
people
started
buying
frozen
pies
instead
of
fresh
pies,
it
naturally
evolved
into
the
frozen
pies
that
it
had
been
in
the
salt
lake
are
for
some
30
years.
all
of
the
respondents
on
the
other
hand
got
into
the
business
by
acquiring
independent
firms,
all
of
them,
got
into
the
business
in
that
manner.
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
an
unsubstantiated
statement
made
by
one
of
the
witnesses
to
be
affected
there.
by
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case
there
were
200
companies
involved
in
the
pie
business
in
the
united
states.
however,
that
ignores
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
record
of
some
rather
clear
concentration
in
this
industry.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
frozen
pie,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
only
product
we're
talking
about
are
frozen
fruit
pies
plus
mince
and
pumpkins,
we
exclude
the
cream
and
the
chocolate
pie
definitely.
we're
talking
about
the
frozen
fruit
pie.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
basically
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
eight-inch
basically
was
involved
here
although
there
was
some
evidence
of
the
nine-inch
pie
in
the
industry.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
in
--
in
the
san
francisco
market
on
the
nine-inch
pie
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
eight-inch
is
the
basic,
the
standard
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
size
we're
talking
about.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
is
diameter,
i
guess.
now,
we
have
a
lot
of
conversation
about
the
ounces
and
weights
in
this
case.
the
--
in
terms
of
concentration,
here's
what
the
record
shows
without
any
contradiction,
that
as
of
1961
in
the
trading
area
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner,
we're
going
to
come
to
that
as
to
what
that
means
in
a
moment.
but
as
of
1961
the
parties
before
the
court
right
now
did
92%
of
all
of
the
business
in
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
trading
area,
immediately
around
this
plant.
petitioner
being
the
only
one
that
has
a
plant
in
this
area.
all
the
other
had
plants
that
were
distantly
removed,
that's
92%.
and
on
the
national
level
four
companies
had
approximately
two-thirds
of
all
the
business.
and
the
petitioners
were
three
of
those
four
companies,
so
the
cavalier
statements
that
there
are
200
--
200
companies
in
this
business
ought
not
to
me
in
the
light
of
this
uncontradicted
evidence
that
there
wasn't
a
serious
concentration
in
this
business
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
in
terms
of
selling
practices,
the
petitioners
sold
on
an
f.
o.
b.
basis,
fast
break,
all
of
the
respondents
sold
on
a
delivered
price
basis,
all
of
them
within
geographic
zones.
and
while
the
zones
weren't
--
weren't
exactly
the
same
with
respect
to
all
of
the
respondents,
there
were
some
similarity
or
some
substantial
equivalence
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
that
they
use
on
their
prices.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
question
of
the
trading
territory
is
important
in
this
case.
it
sold
under
the
terms
of
this
evidence,
it
sold
in
the
state
of
utah,
idaho,
washington,
some
montana,
some
colorado.
that
is
the
trading.
this
was
defined
in
the
evidence
of
the
three.
and
when
we
talk
about
the
utah
trading
area
regardless
of
where
it
was
set
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
a
shorthand
expression
for
saying
it
that
way
instead
of
making
a
--
reciting
a
let
be
all
of
these
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
those
figures
--
the
study
was
made
by
the
respondents
themselves
applied
to
the
heart
of
that
trading
area
that
is
the
area
immediately
around
salt
lake,
utah,
and
southern
idaho.
the
record
doesn't
show
the
figures
for
these
larger
areas
but
it
does
show
the
two-thirds
figures
i've
mentioned
for
the
national,
for
the
area
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
relevant
market
as
defined
is
the
market
of
utah,
idaho,
washington,
montana,
and
colorado.
that
is
the
market
that
was
presented
to
this
jury
that
the
market
upon
which
in
which
the
discrimination
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
for
the
entire
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
for
the
immediate
area
of
utah
and
southern
idaho.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
--
i
don't
do
--
but
the
gravamen
in
the
--
it's
--
it's
--
what
we
were
talking
about,
we
--
our
complaint
is
that
wherever
the
plaintiff
traded,
they
indulged
in
this
discriminatory
practices
for
the
purpose
of
getting
in
place.
this
is
our
complaint.
now,
while
obviously,
the
plaintiff
is
about
two-thirds
maybe
of
his
business
in
the
immediate
area
behind
the
plant.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
he
did
try
to
trade
in
the
denver
market
and
did
trade
in
the
denver
market.
he
did
try
to
trade
in
the
northwest
market
and
did
trade
there.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
they
--
they
certainly
would
be
different
than
they
are
in
the
--
in
the
sherman
act
case
as
yet.
i
think
they
are
the
same
as
they
are
in
the
section
7,
clayton
act
cases,
and
section
3
of
the
clayton
act,
and
section
2,
the
one
we're
operating
at.
they're
different
i
think
than
the
sherman
act
because
these
are
incipiency
tests.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well
we
have
--
we
have
shown
the
market
shares
for
most
of
the
area
based
on
a
study
made
by
the
respondents
themselves.
but
we
do
have
the
market
shares
and
--
and
in
these
circumstances
where
you
have
the
only
independents
that
markets
in
this
area.
the
only
independent
being
utah
pie,
i
--
i
don't
think
when
you
have
all
of
the
evidence
together
there's
much
question
about
the
injury
to
competition,
not
only
the
possibility
of
injury
but
the
actual
injury
to
competition.
i
think
that
this
complaint
then
was
filed
in
september
of
1961
shortly
after
the
respondent
continental
came
into
the
utah
trading
area
with
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
united
states.
it
was
about
35%
lower
than
the
price
charged
by
these
plants.
now,
to
begin
with,
all
of
the
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
admits
the
price
differences
or
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
price
differences
or
price
discrimination
that
simply
said
that
there
--
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
of
the
prohibited
effect,
so
that
we
start
out
with
an
admission
by
all
of
them
that
there
were
a
price
differences.
in
addition
to
the
territorial
price
cutting
or
the
territorial
price
differences
and
the
lower
price
was
further
removed
from
the
plant
itself.
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
these
low
prices
were
prices
below
cost,
that
they
sold
to
the
loss
in
these
areas,
substantial
evidence
on
that.
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
the
low
prices
were
specifically
aimed
at
this
petitioner,
specifically
aimed
at
this
petitioner.
there
was
substantial
evidence
of
predatory
intent
by
all
of
the
respondents
and
we
review
that
just
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
facts
in
a
moment.
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
the
petitioner
itself
suffered
an
injurious
impact
in
terms
of
price
erosion,
loss
of
market
share,
loss
of
volume,
and
damage
to
the
goodwill
or
the
going
concern
value
of
petitioner.
before
going
into
each
of
these
separately,
that
is
pet,
continental,
and
carnation,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word,
another
word
about
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
began
the
freezing
of
pies
in
august
of
1957
after
having
been
in
the
business
for
some
30
years.
in
the
instilling
four
years
up
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
it
sold
in
utah,
idaho,
nevada,
wyoming,
montana,
colorado,
california,
oregon,
washington,
that
area.
and
that
was
described
as
a
relevant
market
area
by
the
economist
for
the
respondents,
mr.
anderson.
in
september
of
1958,
the
petitioner
built
a
new
plant,
and
it
was
a
good
plant
and
it
was
an
efficient
plant
and
the
evidence
on
that
is
rather
dramatic.
one
of
the
respondents,
the
pet
company
had
the
manager
of
its
frozen
food
departments
sneak
into
the
plant
by
fraudulent
means.
we'll
discuss
it
in
a
moment
when
we
talk
about
predatory
intent.
and
he
writes
a
report
about
that
plant,
and
he
said
it's
a
good
plant,
it's
efficiently
run,
and
i
can
see
in
his
words
why
this
plant
is
the
only
real
competition
we
have
for
the
safeway
business.
but
there
isn't
any
question
here
about
the
ability
in
terms
of
efficient
manager
of
the
petitioner.
and
i
think
this
has
some
importance
with
the
whole
question
of
competitive
impact.
with
respect
to
pet,
pet
got
into
the
business,
the
respondent
pet
will
take
the
cases
in
that
order,
pet,
carnation,
and
continental,
which
is
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
took
it.
pet
got
into
the
business
by
acquiring
an
independent
competitor
in
michigan.
they're
after
its
milk
plants
in
california
and
pennsylvania.
so
as
far
a
pet
is
concerned
it
has
its
plants
in
california,
pennsylvania
and
michigan,
and
it
served
the
entire
united
states
from
those
three
plants.
it
is
important
when
you
come
down
and
analyze
how
the
court
of
appeals
regarded
markets
as
just
major
cities.
the
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about
retail
markets
and
not
the
manufacturers
market.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
plants
of
pet
were
in
michigan,
california,
and
pennsylvania.
those
are
the
pet
plants.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
they
served
the
entire
--
entire
country.
in
the
damage
period,
this
company
of
course
made
millions
in
profits
but
it
consistently
sold
at
loss
in
this
trading
area,
so
far
as
its
frozen
food
products
concerned.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
in
so
far
as
the
frozen
pies.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
it
made
million
of
its
overall
business.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
record
shows
that
it
lost
money.
well,
you
mean
whether
it
made
nationally
on
this.
it
lost
for
a
period
of
time
even
nationally,
lost
for
a
period
of
time
even
nationally.
this
was
described
by
the
chief
executive
of
the
pet
company
as
investment
spending.
and
during
the
trial,
we
--
we
think
it's
just
moving
in
on
and
independent.
during
the
trial,
this
was
described
that
selling
at
a
loss
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
franchise
in
a
particular
territory.
now,
there's
an
independent
located
in
that
area
where
you
decide
to
make
this
"investment
spending."
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
a
very
thing
that
section
2
(a)
was
originally
enacted
for
in
1914.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
yes
there
was
a
distinction
in
price.
you
go
and
find
in
appendix
b,
appendix
b
in
our
brief,
you
will
find
a
documented
table,
this
is
where
we
refer
to
all
of
these
invoices,
a
documented
table
of
the
discriminatory
prices
by
pet,
that's
a
comparative
mr.
justice
fortas
of
the
--
of
the
prices
charged
in
california
where
pet
have
a
plant
as
against
the
prices
charged
in
the
utah
trading
area.
that
goes
from
the
date
of
july
of
1959
to
may
of
1961.
now,
that's
a
price
discrimination
predicated
upon
their
quality
pie
having
its
label
called
pet-ritz,
they
were
the
discrimination
between
pet-ritz
and
pet-ritz
in
these
geographical
areas.
in
addition
to
that,
this
pet-ritz
quality
pie
was
sold
to
the
safeway
company
on
what
i
think
is
a
circuit
deal,
we'll
discuss
in
a
moment.
so
the
safeway
company
under
the
safeway
label
of
bel-air.
but
it's
admitted
and
stipulated
in
the
evidence
that
the
exact
pie
sold
on
to
their
quality
label,
they
sold
to
safeway,
the
word
just
simply
thought
at
the
end
of
the
production
line,
you
took
their
quality
label
in
their
own
box
and
you
simply
put
a
safeway
box
to
it.
so
you
had
two
discriminations
there,
just
their
pet-ritz
as
against
pet-ritz
sold
under
that
label,
and
then
pet-ritz
as
against
the
safeway
brand,
the
bel-air
brand.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
at
a
lower
price.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
where
the
plant
was,
750
miles
away.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
later
on
which
is
there
and
so-called
priced
pie
as
against
their
economy
pie.
and
the
evidence
i've
been
encircled
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
simple
simon
was
made
by
carnation
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
at
the
carnation
brand.
so
that
pet
labels
are
pet
--
pet-ritz
and
swiss
miss
and
bel-air
so
far
as
its
packed
for
safeway,
for
safe
--
that
the
bel-air
label
belong
to
the
safeway
company
rather
than
to
the
--
rather
than
to
the
manufacturer.
now,
on
the
--
on
the
safeway
discrimination,
incidentally,
you
have
a
difference
of
about
a
dollar
and
fifty
four
per
dozen,
that
much,
77
cents
for
case
or
a
dollar
fifty
four
per
doz
--
dozen.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
utah
pie
made
some
price
concessions
in
the
record.
this
is
the
basis
on
which
it
was
found
to
have
violated
section
2
(a)
itself.
there
were
some
price
concession
made
but
they
were
minimal
in
terms
of
its
total
business.
actually,
the
price
--
actually
it
sold
generally
on
the
basis
of
the
plant
fast
break,
that
there
was
some
concessions
made
in
order
to
get
the
business.
but
that
--
but
those
concessions
were
not
lower,
if
that
all
and
the
concessions
that
were
being
made
by
the
--
by
the
pet
company.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
was
a
general
pricing
policy
of
the
petitioner
as
distinguished
from
the
respondents
who
had
delivered
price
systems
within
zones
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
as
distinguished
from.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
they
had
a
--
they
have
a
california
zone
in
northwest
--
a
northwest
zone
and
intermountain
zone.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
there
was
a
uniform
--
there
was
a
uniform
delivered
price
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
within
the
zone
and
sometimes
within
two
zones.
and
they
made
concessions
off
of
that.
so
it
is
rather
that
the
lower
prices
were
in
the
utah
trading
area
and
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
country
as
i
say
was
in
salt
lake
city.
the
lowest
price
to
that
is
the
continental
price
is
$2.55
which
precipitated
the
loss.
that's
why
we
brought
the
lawsuit.
now
with
respect
to
the
pet
--
pet-ritz,
bel-air
discrimination
that
is
the
safeway
discrimination,
the
court
of
appeals
gets
around
that
by
making
what
i
--
what
i
think
that
great
difference
can
only
be
described
as
findings
of
facts.
it
says
that
the
safeway
price
discrimination
was
cost
justified.
actually,
the
evidence
showed
a
cost
--
even
an
attempted
cost
justification
for
only
a
minor
part
of
the
period.
and
that
cost
justification
included
among
other
things
the
advertising
justification
which
this
court
rejected
in
the
recent
borden
case.
this
notion
that
there's
a
--
that
there's
a
real
cost
differential
just
because
you
put
the
canned
milk
in
borden
--
borden
can
in
one
instance
and
in
a
private
label,
the
safeway
private
label
in
another
instance.
so
there
was
a
very
great
conflict
in
the
evidence
on
cost
justification
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
to
handle
this
statement
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
i
think
frank
in
saying
that
you
could
misconstrue
the
evidence
unless
you
put
an
improper
perspective,
proper
focus
for
the
language
used.
i
submit
that
that
basically
is
a
jury
question,
putting
the
evidence
in
a
perspective.
that
is
a
finding.
the
inferences
you
derive
from
the
evidence.
but
then
secondly,
and
this
one
will
hurt
a
little
bit,
the
court
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
anyway
because
safeway
was
unwilling
to
buy
from
utah
pie
because
of
the
unwillingness
of
utah
pie
to
put
in
certain
quality
controls.
i
just
--
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
evidence
except
in
terms
of
(inaudible).
on
this
one
i
wanted
to
just
talk
a
little
bit
about
it.
that
you
can
see
what
happened
to
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
says
flatly
safeway
was
unwilling
to
buy
from
you.
i
think
it's
what
the
evidence
showed.
that
sends
its
manager
of
the
frozen
food
division
down
to
salt
lake
city.
it
has
a
meeting
with
some
competitors
in
the
warehouse
down
by
the
railroad
somewhere.
and
he
decides
to
sneak
into
the
plant
of
the
petitioner
by
posing
as
a
broker
from
the
northwest
who
was
interested
in
distributing
the
products
of
the
petitioner
in
the
northwest.so
we
showed
at
the
plant
on
that
--
on
that
basis
and
gain
his
business
to
the
plant.
this
is
the
manager
of
the
frozen
food
division
of
the
pet
company.
he
is
admitted
to
the
pet
plant.
while
he
is
in
there,
he
was
writing
a
report
of
what
he
sees
and
he
said,
"this
is
a
great
plant.
it's
efficiently
managed.
it
has
all
of
the
sanitation.
and
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
a
very
serious
competitor
with
it,
with
a
substance
up
for
the
safeway
business."
then
he
goes
on
further
to
say,
"i
can
see
why
safeway
regards
this
company
as
the
only
plant
that
can
pack
for
it
other
than
ourselves."
i
remember
the
court
of
appeal
said,
safeway
was
unwilling
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
they
had
bought
mince
and
--
and
pumpkin.
there's
a
seasonal
pie,
a
holiday
pie,
not
the
fruit
pie.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
pet
manager
acknowledges
that
safeway
had
finally
told
him
that
this
was
a
one
plant
that
could
compete
for
the
business,
the
petitioner
testified
that
two
days
before
the
surreptitious
plant
visit,
he
had
talked
to
the
safeway
buyer
who
told
him,
"you're
going
to
get
the
business,
go
out
and
buy
the
fruit,"
apples
in
this
case
to
count
through
about
50%
of
the
market.
and
he
said
he
went
out
and
bought
the
apples
on
the
basis
of
that
representation.
the
safeway
buyers
couldn't
understand
and
he
is
asked
whether
or
not
he
in
fact
told
the
pet
people
what
the
memorandum
showed.
that's
its
question
of
word
against
word
or
even
uncontradicted
word
is
a
memorandum,
a
contemporaneous
memorandum
against
what
he
was
going
to
say.
he
said,
"no,
that
isn't
so."
then
at
the
trial
itself
we're
able
to
get
out
of
the
brief
case
of
one
of
the
witnesses
another
memorandum
that
wasn't
produced
during
the
production
period
which
says
about
this
safeway
buyer
whose
credibility
the
court
accepted
as
against
all
of
its
conflict.
this
is
kind
of
a
peculiar
buyer
really,
says,
this
man
young
will
act
as
a
door
opener
for
us,
for
our
sales
personnel.
in
addition,
it
says,
he
is
going
to
send
us
inter-office
memoranda
of
the
safeway
company
but
we
must
never
disclose
that
we
got
it
from
you.
and
these
inter-office
memoranda
will
point
the
way
as
to
the
approach
you
should
make
to
the
safeway
people.
we
ask
the
man
who
wrote
the
memorandum
whether
he
agreed
with
the
buyer
about
that,
his
own
memorandum,
he
said,
"no."
in
other
words,
he
denied
his
own
memorandum.
we
asked
the
safeway
man,
"did
you
make
these
agreements
to
send
your
own
inter-office
memorandum
to
these
people
to
help
them
make
the
sales?"
he
denied
it.
now,
with
that
kind
of
conflict
and
i
say
that
--
did
that
the
--
that
the
inference
is
almost
inevitable.
that
that
was
done
the
court
of
appeals
is
very
gladly
says,
safeway
wasn't
in
a
fight
from
them
anyway.
now,
quality
control
doesn't
mean
sanitation,
it
doesn't
mean
anything
like
that,
it
simply
means
the
bookkeeping
system
to
know
when
a
particular
pie
was
produced.
i
apologized
to
going
into
that
kind
of
detail
but
this
is
one
clear
episode
and
there
are
about
10
of
them
like
this
where
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
the
word
of
a
man
against
the
contemporaneous
documents.
and
this
was
a
very
real
issue
before
the
jury.
we
attacked
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses
and
it
was
argued
by
the
--
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
pet
and
it
was
argued
by
us.
and
we
said
they
ought
to
believe
the
evidence
of
the
documents
and
the
evidence
of
the
plaintiff
who
said
that
safeway
was
going
to
deal
with
it.
well,
in
any
event
they
lost
that
safeway
business.
now,
they
lost
it
in
circumstances
where
there
was
a
contract
between
pet
and
say
"well,
which
we
said
was
the
total
requirements
contract,
this
guy
for
causing
illegal
features.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
they
didn't
get
to
repeat
business
on
it.
they
got
it
once.
but
in
any
event
i
--
i
don't
say
you
have
to
accept
all
our
inference.
this
is
--
all
you
have
to
do
is
see
that
this
was
this
serious
conflict
where
there
obviously
greater
weight
of
evidence
was
on
our
side.
and
of
course
the
breaking
into
plant,
this
was
in
the
burglary
case
or
false
entry
case.
we
claim
to
the
jury
that
they
will
not
be
suede
by
that
fact
that
they
could
use
it
in
terms
of
the
determining
whether
there
was
predatory
intent
against
this
particular
petitioner
and
whether
the
activity,
price
activities
were
motivated
by
that
predatory
intent
because
the
existence
of
the
predatory
intent
is
itself
significant
evidence
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prohibited
effect
was
brought
about.
now,
in
addition
before
leaving
pet,
in
addition
to
the
men
and
the
obvious
men
of
the
station
with
the
predatory
intent,
we
think
they
use
the
swiss
miss
as
kind
of
a
fighting
brand.
but
we
were
accused
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
the
jury
as
simply
using
anti-trust
clichés
as
they
were
called.
and
they
called
this
business
about
breaking
into
the
plant.
the
industrial
espionage
was
in
essence
with
the
word
that
implied
by
the
jury,
we
didn't
make
this
fact.
the
fact
was
made
by
their
own
plant
manager.
now,
so
far
as
swiss
miss
is
concerned,
and
the
court
inquired
about
that
on
a
national
basis
they
sold
their
quality
pie
greatly.
they
volume
of
the
quality
pie
was
greatly
over
the
quality
of
this
swiss
miss
which
was
a
price
pie
of
pure
ounce
of
(voice
overlap)
in
effect,
so
then.
in
this
market,
in
this
trading
area,
now
i'm
talking
about
the
heart
of
the
trading
area,
in
this
market,
swiss
miss
sold
13
to
1
as
against
the
quality
pie.
we
said
they
were
simply
using
it
as
a
fighting
brand
in
that
particular
area.
now,
that
the
jury
have
the
right
to
believe
it
that
way
and
i
say
factual
question
in
any
event
and
right
or
wrong,
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
it
just
in
those
figures.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
and
i
think
the
jury
has
the
right
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
i
think
that's
true
but
when
you're
talking
about
--
when
you're
quality
pies,
i
think
these
were
unlabeled,
there
is
room
to
argue
that.
when
you're
talking
about
these
pies,
price
pie,
the
fact
that
you
have
a
13
to
1
volume
in
this
trading
area
where
they're
carrying
out
all
of
these
other
activities,
don't
view
it
as
an
isolation,
where
they
carry
out
all
of
these
other
activities,
i
think
it's
evident
that
they
are
using
it
as
a
fighting
brand
at
least
the
jury
was
invited
to
conclude
it
was
and
it
was
a
factual
basis
in
which
they
made
that
conclusion.
sure
there
might
be
conflicting
evidence.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
--
that's
the
concept,
it's
true.
they
--
and
then
you
have
to
get
them
here.
they
use
this
cheap
pie
to
get
them
where
they
couldn't
sacrifice
the
quality
pie
too
much.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
--
i
think
there's
some
evidence
of
price
variation
on
swiss
miss
but
not
a
great
deal.
there
is
some
but
--
but
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
use
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
and
the
figures
i
think
show
it
and
there's
nothing
in
the
taste,
the
survey
made
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
matter
of
just
local
practice.
in
any
event
there
were
conflicting
facts
that
the
jury
should
have
made
the
determination
from.
i
don't
say
that
their
facts
were
100%
on
our
side,
there
are
conflict
in
the
evidence.
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
conceding,
that
if
the
verdict
had
been
the
other
way,
i
think
that
we
would
have
had
difficulty
arguing
that
there
was
completed
sufficiency
of
evidence.
it
is
a
matter
of
who
determines
the
factual
question.
somebody
who
sits
and
tries
to
put
things
in
perspective
in
a
library
or
the
jury
that
looked
at
that
safeway
buyer
to
determine
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth
as
against
the
contemporaneous
memorandum
and
as
against
the
--
the
behavior
of
the
pet
witnesses
on
that
stand.
now,
so
far
as
carnation
is
concerned,
carnation
went
into
the
business,
and
i'll
discuss
the
content
of
the
facts
in
a
moment
as
to
all
of
them.
so
far
as
carnation
is
concerned,
it
went
into
the
business
by
again
acquiring
an
independent,
and
that
independent
was
acquired
in
1955
and
it
had
simple
simon,
simple
simon
label.
it
had
a
plant
in
california.
now,
unlike
the
other
two,
it
didn't
sound
nationally
but
it
sold
all
the
way
through
the
mississippi
river
and
some
place
within
the
east,
that's
the
only
distinction
between
the
two
in
terms
of
national
selling
area.
the
lowest
profit
in
any
of
these
years
with
the
carnation
company
was
$18
million
but
it
lost
money
in
the
distribution
of
its
frozen
foods
in
this
area,
so
just
as
pet,
this
is
in
the
case
of
pet,
they
have
multimillion
dollar
profits
but
a
lost
in
this
particular
area
and
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
frozen
foods,
frozen
foods
generally,
frozen
foods
generally
of
which
pies
were
a
substantial
factor.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
is
on
the
frozen
foods.
now,
so
far
as
price
discrimination
is
concerned,
you
will
find
a
tabulation
at
pages
36
and
37
of
the
brief.
not
to
go
into
detail
on
it
because
here
again,
the
price
difference
is
conceded.
you
find
that
tabulation
covering
a
period
from
november
1959
to
september
of
1961,
the
date
we
filed
this
complaint.
and
you
find
that
tabulation
compares
the
northern
california
price,
their
plant
was
located
in
california,
as
against
the
salt
lake
city
area
prices
and
you'll
see
very
substantial
discriminations.
we
also
at
page
39
have
shown
the
number
of
days
of
this
price
discrimination
between
northern
california
and
the
salt
lake,
salt
lake
city
area.
now,
the
carnation
sales
were
at
a
lost,
but
more
than
that
they
were
planned
at
a
lost.
now,
there's
been
some
discussion
about
that
and
i
just
like
to
say
a
word
on
them.
they
say
well
that
if
you're
budget
loses,
that's
simply
somebody
trying
to
make
an
actual
statement
as
what's
likely
to
happen
in
this
market.
on
the
other
hand,
the
jury
can
say
that
they
intentionally
sold
at
a
loss
to
get
a
foothold
and
were
prepared
to
subsidized
those
loses
from
their
overall
price.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
it
is
not
necessary
it's
just
plus
or
velvet
when
you
have
it,
when
you
do
have
the
elements
of
the
intent.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
have
a
specific
intent
to
get
this
particular
competitor
or
a
even
a
specific
intent
to
injure
competition.
if
you
have
the
price
difference
and
the
reasonable
possibility
of
the
effect
is
there,
then
you
don't
need
an
intent.
but
when
you
have
intent
it
would
tend
to
support
the
reasonable
possibility
of
competitive
injury.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
our
view
is
that
they
did
it
both
with
the
intent
and
the
effect
that
the
intent
wasn't
necessary
and
on
a
specific
question
as
to
whether
a
large
conglomerate
company
can
say,
"well,
i'd
like
to
get
in
to
that
area.
so
i'm
going
in
at
a
much
lower
price
and
i
have
at
my
plan.
now,
they're
going
to
transport
of
750
miles
and
go
in
to
the
much
lower
price.
now,
that
lower
price
doesn't
have
to
be
at
a
loss.
but
in
this
case
if
you
prove
it
here
that's
a
loss
i
think
this
is
just
precisely
what
that
section
means
if
the
company
can't
do
it,
if
there's
a
strong
independent
located
in
that
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
is
what
i
think
it
means,
yes.
now,
with
a
conglomerate
company
if
it
goes
into
an
area
and
it
knows
that
there's
an
independent
in
that
area,
they
are
distinguished
from
competing
with
pet
or
as
distinguished
from
competing
with
continental
and
it
knows
that
the
effect
of
what
its
doing
say
as
to
put
that
company
out
of
business
even
or
to
injure
it
or
to
impair
its
capital
structure,
i
see
this
is
exactly
what
2
(a)
means
that
you
can't
do
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
the
original
one,
just
to
compare
to
the
original
2
(a)
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
you
pointed
out
in
our
lower
courts,
2
(a)
involved
and
attempt
to
get
what
was
disclosed
in
the
tobacco
and
standard
oil
cases
of
this
overtrading
by
a
large
national
company
or
a
company
with
great
financial
resources
in
a
local
area
where
the
price
is
cut
just
at
that
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
the
difference
in
prices
in
two
--
a
territorial
one
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
is
a
primary
line
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
in
the
primary
line
cases
that
price
difference
is
a
price
in
california,
that's
a
price
against
salt
lake
city.
and
nobody
was
trying
to
insulate
this
up
which
they
claim
as
the
court
of
appeals
claim
from
competition.
anybody
was
privileged
to
go
up
there
and
build
a
plant
or
to
compete
in
any
other
way
but
i
think
the
statute
says
you
can't
go
in
there
and
sell
at
a
loss
to
the
--
where,
where
the
effect
is
to
injure
that
independent.
so
incidentally
their
own
--
their
own
economic
witness,
dr.
anderson
that
the
sales
by
a
large
conglomerate
corporation
a
loss
planned
in
advance
was
evidence
about
ulterior
motive
as
he
put
it,
evidence
of
less
than
perfect
competition
or
unnatural
pricing
as
he
also
put
it.
and
he
also
said
that
the
lower
price
could
be
predatory
"as
one
of
the
possibility".
he's
their
own
witness.
i
say
this
evidence
was
before
that
jury.
now,
with
respect
to
continen
--
i'll
carry
along
with
that
and
get
to
the
procedural
problem.
continental
as
the
other
two
got
into
the
business
by
buying
an
independent
in
1955.
the
sales
of
this
company
in
the
period
of
1958
to
1961,
the
overall
sales
were
in
excess
of
a
half
billion
dollars.
the
profits
were
$75
million
but
it's
sold
at
a
loss
in
the
utah
trading
area.
now,
pet
and
continental
were
the
two
largest
sellers
in
the
united
states.
in
continental,
there
was
an
evidence
that
continental
was
a
price
leader.
from
1958
to
1961,
its
frozen
foods
department
operated
a
loss
despite
these
other
process
and
specifically
what
prospective
--
that
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
united
states
as
the
evidence
showed
was
by
continental
in
salt
lake
city.
continental
had
its
plant
in
virginia,
they
had
a
plant
in
iowa,
it
have
a
custom
packing
arrangement
in
california.
continental
too
sold
on
a
deliberate
price
basis
within
geographic
zones.
now,
with
respect
to
predatory
intent
and
this
again,
the
court
of
appeals
treats
us
though
there
wasn't
any
conflict
in
the
evidence.
the
broker
of
continental
told
the
petitioner
that
i
am
going
to
run
you
out
of
business,
broker
of
continental,
only
that
i
do
that.
and
then
shortly
after
telling
that
for
a
period
from
june
16
to
august
12
of
1961
continental
instituted
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
united
states
on
frozen
pies
in
a
transaction
with
the
safeway
company
which
is
extended
to
us.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
the
statement
made
by
a
respondent
that
this
was
just
a
two-week
deal.
that
this
needs
a
little
analysis,
first
of
all
it
wasn't
two
weeks,
that
that
price
of
$2.55
admittedly
below
cost
or
at
least
substantial
evidence
that
it
was
below
cost.
that
price
lasted
from
june
16
to
august
12,
and
was
the
thing
that
precipitated
this
lawsuit.
when
you
sell
a
six-week
supply
and
the
evidence
was
that
even
though
there
were
two
sales,
it
was
a
six-week
supply,
when
you
sell
a
six-week
supply
simply
like
the
safeway
company,
you
don't
have
a
six-week
effect
on
the
price
structure.
it
may
take
a
year
to
get
over
the
injury
that
a
six-week
price
with
the
safeway
company
can
bring
about.
and
this
was
argued
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
was
invited
to
assess
this
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
injury
to
the
competition.
this
price
incidentally
was
35%
lower
than
the
price
the
same
company
sold
in
california
at
the
same
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
it
was
that
at
the
end
safeway
or
morton.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
period.
morton
kind
of
stayed
out
of
these
markets
for
awhile.
it
was
in
1958,
it
kind
of
stayed
out
and
then
after
this
broker
had
this
conversation,
they
came
in
with
this
low
price.
now,
there's
admittedly
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
broker
was
employed
by
continental
at
the
time
of
the
conversation
where
he
told
the
plaintiff
he
was
going
to
get
them.
but
there's
a
conflict.
the
written
document
shows
that
he
was,
the
oral
testimony
says
he
was
not,
he
was
employed
a
few
weeks
later.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
actually.
but
there
was
a
conflict
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
resolved
that
conflict,
it
was
for
the
jury
to
resolve.
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
wholesale
elimination
from
this
evidence
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
is
the
1935
amendment,
that
last
portion
you've
read.
we
are
claiming
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
injury
to
competition
under
the
incipiency
test.
that
was
all
that's
required.
now,
later
on
for
treble
damage
purposed
you
do
have
to
show
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
(voice
overlap)
-
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
relying
on
that
last
clause,
that
in
other
words
we
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
here
of
injury
to
com
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
except
that
under
the
general
injury
to
competition,
we
claim
that
we
were
unable
to
get
the
safeway
contract
because
of
these
price
discriminations.
we
were
unable
to
expand
into
the
--
into
the
denver
area
over
and
above
what
we
did
there,
unable
to
expand
into
the
northwest
area.
but
i
think
that
the
test
so
far
as
the
primary
line
is
concerned,
the
test
is
far
and
this
is
the
test
we
submitted
to
the
jury
in
--
that
proposed
in
the
instructions
which
the
court
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
test
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
court
--
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
--
this
question
is
whether
there
has
to
be
injury
to
competition
or
injury
to
a
competitor.
it
is
you
know
a
question
that's
presently
engaging
the
courts.
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
in
this
--
in
this
situation.
for
this
reason,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it's
quite
obvious
that
injury
to
this
plaintiff
is
injury
to
competition
because
this
plaintiff
is
the
only
substantial
independent
competitor
in
the
area.
it's
the
only
one.
there
aren't
any
others.
so
that
injury
to
this
plaintiff
is
substantial
injury
to
competition.
now,
the
court
properly
instructed
that
its
injury
to
competition
you
must
find,
not
just
injury
to
a
competitor.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i
don't
think
in
the
con
--
i
think
that
could
be
so
in
another
case
but
not
in
the
context
of
the
facts
we
have
here.
the
areas
we're
talking
about,
the
--
the
injury
--
the
injury
to
this
particular
competitor
resulted
in
an
erosion
of
its
price
structure,
that's
one.
but
more
importantly,
it
precluded
here
from
expanding
his
distribution
in
the
northwest
area,
it
precluded
him
from
expanding
his
distribution
in
the
denver
area.
now,
on
--
with
specifically
with
respect
to
the
denver
area
which
the
court
of
appeals
read
out
of
the
case
entirely
or
just
let
me
say
a
word
on
that
because
i
think
it
fits
in
with
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white.
the
pretrial
order
in
this
case
was
very
explicit
on
the
back
that
we
were
talking
about
colorado.
here
it
was
not.
there
was
price
discrimination
in
the
record
as
you
will
see
in
appendix
c
in
the
brief
between
denver,
colorado
and
areas
and
other
areas
for
the
morton
company,
very
clear
price
discrimination.
we
introduced
that
evidence.
it
was
argued
to
the
jury.
we
had
information
on
damages;
on
our
damage
exhibit,
we
had
damages
for
the
denver
area.
we
have
a
witness
who
examined
on
the
denver
area.
the
counsel
for
continental
cross-examined
that
damage
witness
on
the
denver
area.
i
argue
that
to
the
jury,
they
argued
it
to
the
jury.
the
form
of
the
verdict
simply
said,
utah
trading
area
and
throughout,
we
have
talked
about
that
meaning
as
the
area
in
which
the
plaintiff
distributes
or
sells
its
pies
despite
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
denver
wasn't
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
possibly
come
to
that
conclusion.
when
judge
wheeler
framed
his
decree,
this
is
how
much
he
thought
that
was
in
the
case.
he
says
that
the
violation
occurred
in
the
plaintiff's
trading
area
(utah,
idaho,
washington,
montana,
and
colorado,
as
against
california),
where
the
defendant's
production
facilities
are
located.
and
then
he
decree
that
there
should
be
no
lower
prices
in
utah,
idaho,
washington,
montana,
and
colorado
than
in
california
or
in
the
case
of
continental
for
the
state
of
colorado
the
prices
charged
in
iowa.
now,
how
in
the
line
of
that
record,
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
that
denver
wasn't
in
this
case
when
it
states
it.
it
specifically
says
that
because
now
the
damage
exhibit
1
to
that
jury
and
judge
told
the
--
told
the
jury
consider
that
damage
exhibit
with
denver
on
it
and
was
cross-examined
because
the
form
of
verdict
said
utah
trading
area,
the
judge
says
that
means
the
state
of
utah
in
effect
or
the
immediate
area
upon.
and
i
submit
in
any
event
that
--
that
that
the
trial
court
understood
it
differently.
obviously,
counsel
for
the
respondents
understood
it
differently,
he
crossed-examined
on
that
damage
exhibit
relating
to
denver.
the
denver
invoices
are
in
the
record,
they
are
in
evidence
and
on
that
basis,
i
submit
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
point
simply
couldn't
put
that
denver
picture
in
into
perspective
or
focus
as
we
call
it
and
eliminated
the
whole
sale
from
the
case.
now
the
--
finally,
we
think
the
evidence
showed
injurious
impact,
i
think,
were
required
in
the
private
damage
action
to
show
the
elements
of
violation
of
injurious
impact
and
not
that
economic
evidence
in
this
record
to
justify
the
damage
awards,
and
i
think
the
damage
awards
are
rather
conservative
in
this
case.
there
was
a
price
erosion
from
a
$4
level
to
a
$3
level
in
the
period
of
time
that
was
before
the
jury
and
whether
this
price
erosion
was
the
effect
of
the
competitive
practices
of
the
respondents
was
for
the
jury
to
say
and
the
jury
found
it
our
way,
in
that
respect.
there
were
reduced
volumes.
it
started
out
with
its
prime
advertised
brand
at
70%
in
1958.
the
court
of
appeals
made
several
marks
about
this
almost
approaching
monopoly,
but
in
the
regional
if
you
have
a
regional
company,
the
only
plant
in
the
area
you
would
expect
that
volume
immediately
around
its
plant
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
but
its
market
share
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
went
down
from
70
if
you
say
what
happened
to
it,
went
down
from
70
to
58
to
40
to
33
on
the
advertised
brands.
and
we
asked
the
economic
witness
of
respondents,
don't
you
think
that
that
kind
of
a
loss
on
the
advertised
brand
is
a
competitive
injury?
does
the
--
the
--
the
manufacturer's
advertised
brand?
and
they
said,
"yes,
it
was."
and
those
figures
were
in
that
record.
and
its
overall
share
declined
from
66
to
34
to
45,
45
in
a
four-year
period
at
a
percentage
arrangement.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
level
is
actually
below
the
$3
level.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
when
continental
came
in
with
a
very
lowest
price
that
was
ever
charged
anywhere
in
the
entire
united
states,
we
came
down
and
met
that
price.
at
the
time
that
it
was
charging
this
$2.55
price,
to
use
the
actual
figures
in
salt
lake
city
had
this
--
in
a
california
sale
of
about
the
same
day
maybe
even
the
same
day
or
the
day
after
it
was
charging
$4
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
there
was
some
evidence
that
--
well,
the
--
the
$4
price
was
there
in
the
fax
mar
--
in
the
fax
market
invoice
in
california
in
1961.
they
may
have
been
other
places
in
the
country
where
there
was
a
lower
price
but
in
california
where
the
plant
was
located
that
$4
price
is
still
obtained.
now,
one
of
the
ways
that
the
court
gets
around
that
is
by
saying,
"well
they
were
advertising
allowances
which
we
are
going
to
regard
as
a
price
cut."
there
was
substantial
evidence
by
the
respondents
if
their
advertising
allowances
were
in
price
cuts,
if
they
got
a
quid
pro
quo
for
their
advertising
allowance.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
in
the
case
of
that
--
when
we're
talking
about
the
comparison
of
the
$2.55
price
against
the
$4
price,
there
were
$2.55
price
which
then
involved
advertising
allowances.
it
was
just
a
price
cut.
now,
that
$4
price
may
have
had
some
advertising
allowances
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
and
that
would
standardized
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
it's
not
subject
to
reduction
if
it's
an
advertising
allowance.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
mean
it's
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
if
you
--
if
you
say
that
the
advertising
allowance
is
a
price
cut,
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
if,
as
the
evidence
shows
and
there
was
--
and
there
was
not
much
conflict
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
with
respect
to
specific
invoices
of
the
periods
that
time,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
don't
recall
that
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
from
special
promotions,
some
of
the
carnation
did
but
10
to
20
cents
a
case
was
a
little
more
logical.
now,
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
the
--
just
let
me
say
including
this
whole
matter
that
--
there
was
this
abundant
evidence
here
of
predatory
intent,
that
this
prices
were
aimed
specifically
at
these
company,
the
--
the
fraudulent
entry
into
the
plant,
the
transactions
with
the
safeway
company,
there
was
a
permanent
diversion
of
business
here,
evidence
of
a
permanent
diversion
of
business
as
a
substantial
disparity
inside
the
courts
between
them.
there
were
sales
below
cost,
there's
abundant
evidence
here
to
define
predatory
intent
and
i
think
therefore
abundant
evidence
in
the
light
of
the
injurious
impact
on
this
petitioner
and
the
only
independent
in
the
whole
area,
abundant
evidence
of
the
prohibited
effect.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
oh!
yes.
we
very
seriously
challenge
a
great
number
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
there
are
--
there
are
some
factual
inaccuracies
which
we
have
noted
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
your
assumption
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
yes.
this
is
one
of
--
this
is
one
of
them.
i
--
i
would
say
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i
would
put
it
this
way
with
justice
black
by
and
large
i
think
the
facts
stated
by
the
court
are
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
when
you
come
to
the
safeway
transactions,
no.
not
when
you
come
to
the
pet-safeway
transactions
except
for
that
--
except
for
the
denver
i
think
then
substantially
yes.
so,
on
the
pet-safeway
transactions,
no.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
no,
no.
first
of
all
there
are
abundant
omissions,
if
--
if
your
question
comprehends
to,
mr.
justice
black,
omissions.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i
would
say
that
you'd
have
because
they
were
substantial
omissions,
we
think
the
fact
that
are
just
plain
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
the
facts
stated
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
facts
stated
are
substantially
correct
except
for
the
safeway
transaction,
the
denver
transaction,
and
the
fact
that
there
are
substantial
omissions,
for
example,
this
decline
in
market
share
on
the
private
brands
doesn't
appear
in
the
court's
opinion.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
substantial
omission,
very
substantial
omission.
what
went,
well
--
well,
we
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
--
the
inference
or
competitive
injury
here
is
the
--
and
of
course
there's
a
substantial,
i
must
say
again
that
when
the
court
comes
to
say
what
the
absolute
prices
are,
their
substantial
difference
on
a
factual
basis
because
of
the
advertising
allowance
problem,
substantial
difference
on
that.
i
was
about
to
come
to
the
procedural
questions
involved
in
this
--
in
this
case.
what
happened
to
--
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
was
requested
in
the
trial
court
and
a
new
trial
was
requested
and
it
was
denied.
on
appeal,
the
court
said
that
the
judgment
n.
o.
v.
should
have
been
granted.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
upon
the
procedural
point
relating
to
a
new
trial.
i
am
afraid
that
the
law
in
this
general
area
at
the
moment
is
such
that
when
you
look
at
slocum,
at
redmond,
at
cone,
and
then
at
hennegan,
that
the
bar
and
perhaps
the
bench
could
be
a
little
bit
confused
and
under
the
general
rules
that
ordinarily
the
trial
court
has
to
obey
the
dictate
of
a
--
of
a
court
of
appeals,
the
trial
court
in
this
instance
may
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
cannot
grant
a
new
trial.
but
i
think
obviously
it
should
be
permitted
to
do
so.
now,
we
have
this
anomaly
if
in
terms
of
practical
courtroom
mechanics,
we
have
this
anomaly
in
the
law.
we've
won
this
verdict,
let's
take
this
case.
we
won
the
verdict,
the
judgment
was
entered.
they
made
a
proper
motion
n.
o.
v.
it
was
denied.
if
it
had
been
granted
at
the
trial
level,
we
could
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
nobody
would
question
that.
now,
then
if
instead
of
being
granted
at
the
trial
level,
it's
granted
at
the
appellate
level
then
it's
the
contention
of
the
other
side
and
we
submit
it's
wrong
that
we
can't
have
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
by
winning
below,
we're
prejudiced,
now
that
--
it
doesn't
seem
that
it
ought
to
be
right.
it
is
on
our
position
that
this
court
can
make
all
of
these
cases
consistent
by
simply
saying
that
of
course
the
trial
court
must
obey
the
dictates
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
enter
its
judgment
n.o.v.
but
once
it
has
done
so,
there
ought
to
be
no
difference
on
the
new
trial
procedure
whether
that
judgment
was
entered
on
the
initiative
of
the
trial
court
or
on
the
initiative
of
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
i
think
clearly
indicates
there's
justice
in
letting
the
trial
court
make
that
final
determination.
one
of
the
usual
grounds
for
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
newly
discovered
evidence.
that
evidence
could
be
discovered
even
after
the
court
of
appeals
comes
down
with
a
direction
to
enter
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
and
there's
no
reason
why
within
the
ten-day
period,
the
loser
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
that
ground
or
any
other
ground
that
is
available
to
him.
we
know
of
no
case,
and
i
submit
those
cited
by
respondents
don't
really
hit
this
point.
and
we
know
of
no
statute
which
expressly
precludes
the
trial
court
from
granting
a
new
trial
after
it
enters
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
we
know
of
no
case
that
does
it.
the
original
judicial
coach
here
gives
the
court
of
appeals
power
and
authority
to
reverse
a
judgment.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
can't
add
to
that
judgment
and
you
may
not
in
any
circumstance
grant
a
new
trial.
it
doesn't
say
that,
it
just
says
that
you
can
reverse.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
you
appear
to
have
done
that
of
course
in
hennegan
and
this
i
think
it
was
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
confusion.
i
think
if
you
take
the
literal
language
of
50
(c)
(2)
that
the
answer
would
be
yes.
in
the
final
analysis
it's
not
this
court
that
enters
that
judgment
n.
o.
v.
or
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
that
trial
court.
he
finally
said
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct,
alright.
now,
then
50
(c)
(2)
makes
no
distinction
at
least
in
its
language
regardless
of
what
those
framers
intended
makes
no
distinction
between
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
entered
on
the
initiative
of
the
trial
court
or
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
entered
at
the
direction
of
an
appellate
court.
it
makes
no
distinction
at
all,
so
i
say
the
language
covers
it.
now,
to
be
true
those
notes
indicate
that
their
talking
about
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
entered
by
the
trial
courts
before
there
has
been
any
appeal.
but
if
you
look
at
that
language,
the
trial
court
does
not
inhibit
it
nor
should
it
be.
but
--
but
i
think
it
needs
a
clear
direction
now
from
this
court
saying
that
of
course
a
trial
court
has
to
obey
the
court
of
appeals
and
does
when
it
enters
the
judgment
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
would
think
so
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
had
the
option
to
say
new
trial
and
didn't
take
it.
and
this
is
why
we
answered
the
question,
no.
but
we
agree
that
it
should
be
that
the
final
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
new
trial,
should
be
in
that
trial
court.
i
--
i
think
they're
wrong,
carnation
says,
"well,
there's
going
to
be
some
kind
of
a
guerilla
war
there
between
the
two
of
course."
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
to
deny
appeal
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
on
the
motion
granting,
granting
a
new
trial,
the
general
rule
is,
it's
not
an
appealable
order.
is
that
what
your
honor
is
getting
at?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
alright,
it's
not
--
it's
not
an
appealable
order.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
even
though
there's
a
decision,
determination
that
you
must
enter
judgment
n.
o.
v.
against
the
winner,
it
seems
to
me
as
the
trial
judge
ought
to
make
the
last
determination
as
to
whether
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
now,
in
making
that
determination
of
course,
he's
bound
by
the
law
enunciated
by
the
court
of
appeal
that
there's
nothing
to
indicate
except
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
passed
on.
he
probably
will
deny
the
trial,
but
in
the
final
analysis
that
judgment
ought
to
be
made
by
the
trial
court
and
not
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
there
--
there
can
be
a
lot
of
reasons
where
in
a
new
trial
you
will
have
new
evidence.
for
example,
in
the
protracted
case
like
this,
this
is
a
practical
matter
that
the
plaintiff's
counsel
may
determine
not
to
offer
all
of
his
evidence
in
the
interest
of
streamlining
the
case.
he
thinks
he
has
enough.
then
somebody
picks
a
segment
out
of
this
case
in
some
manner
which
he
couldn't
possibly
foresee.
he
ought
not
to
be
foreclosed
from
thereon
in
as
apparently
this
court
tried
to
do
in
its
direction.
so
that
he
should
be
foreclosed
and
we
believe
that
50
(c)
(2)
literally
permits
but
which
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
say
so
explicitly
before
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
believe
it.
but
that
literally
permits
the
court
to
grant
a
new
trial
even
after
entering
the
judgment
n.
o.
v.
at
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that's
of
course
the
way
it
should
be
as
a
matter
of
simple
justice,
we
ought
not
to
have
this
anomaly
where
you
worst
off
for
winning.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
i
think
that
that
--
that
i
think
that
that
rule
specifically
permits
that
he
has
to
grant
new
trial
was
to
direct
the
trial
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
don't
know
which
had
had
first
cracked
out
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
trial
court
as
a
practical
matter
should
have
the
last
backup.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
now,
this
is
going
to
be
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
ask
the
trial
court
for
a
new
trial
but
presumably
the
trial
court
is
going
to
deny
that
the
only
grounds
for
your
new
trial
are
those
already
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
for
example
that
in
--
in
the
example
you
are
using
suppose
after
we
get
down
the
newly
discovered
evidence
is
--
is
brought
to
light.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
don't
know
why
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
that's
a
little
more
difficult.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
however,
it
doesn't
work
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
but
--
but
i
don't
know
why
we
should
be
proposed
from
having
a
59
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
because
at
some
juncture,
at
some
juncture
if
you
--
if
you
win
the
trial
at
the
court
of
appeals,
still
they're
going
to
review
that
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i
think
that
generally
held
to
be
non-appealable.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
not
done,
you
won't
review
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
but
you
review
the
matter
after
the
trial
has
been
handed
if
any
injunctions
have
been
done.
and
then
you
can
reach
the
determination.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
our
view
is
that
that
does
not
preclude
the
trial
judge
from
acting
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
even
though
he's
directed
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
but
we
agree
that
it
doesn't
deny
and
in
fact
that
it
doesn't
is
pretty
coaching
evidence
that
the
last
words
should
be
held
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
question
of
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
agree
with
that
means.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
the
appellate
court
--
well
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
it
may
order
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
the
question
is,
i
think
the
question
is
however
may
it
preclude
the
trial
court
from
acting
if
it
doesn't
order
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
we
say
it
ought
not
to.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
private
anti
trust
suit.
in
the
trial
court,
the
petitioner,
the
utah
pie
company
won
the
verdicts.
and
a
judgment
was
entered
on
that
verdict
of
$350,000.
in
addition
to
winning
the
verdict,
it
also
secured
from
the
trial
court
a
decree
which
prohibited
the
respondents
from
charging
a
lower
price
for
the
product
in
the
trading
area
of
the
petitioner
than
a
charge
in
those
states
of
california
and
iowa,
respectively,
where
the
respondents
had
their
plants.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
respondents
timely,
made
timely
motions
for
directed
verdicts.
those
motions
were
reserved.
after
the
jury
verdict
and
the
entry
of
the
judgment
for
the
petition,
the
respondents
made
motions
for
judgment
n.
o.
v.
and
motions
for
a
new
trial.
the
trial
courts
denied
both
of
those
motions.
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
wiped
out
the
judgment
for
money
damages
and
it
wiped
out
the
decree
for
injunctive
relief
and
in
the
course
of
doing
it
said
that
the
cause
should
be
remanded
to
the
dis
--
to
the
district
court
with
a
direction
"to
enter
judgment
for
defendants,"
that
was
the
direction.
a
ground
relied
upon
the
court
of
appeals
for
reversal
of
both
the
money
judgment
and
the
decree
was
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
findings,
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
and
the
judgment
that
was
entered
on
that
verdict.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
there
were
separate
verdicts
justice
stewart.
the
verdict
against
the
continental
company
was
for
$88,000,
the
verdict
against
the
pet
company
was
for
a
$152,000,
the
verdict
against
carnation
was
for
$93,000,
and
then
the
--
the
decree
ran
separately
in
effect
as
to
each
of
them.
in
the
original
complaint,
there
was
a
cost
stated
for
section
1
of
the
--
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
a
cost
stated
under
2
(a)
separately.
what
we
in
effect
said
is
that
the
discriminatory
price
was
brought
about
as
the
result
of
some
cooperation
among
three
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
respondents.
but
we
made
it
clear
and
the
trial
court
made
it
clear
that
in
the
event
the
jury
found
on
both
counts
that
the
petitioner
wouldn't
get
the
damages
from
both
but
that
the
court
would
select
one
or
the
other
so
there
was
not
much
of
an
overlap.
nevertheless,
the
--
the
verdict
and
the
judgments
were
a
separate
verdict
and
judgments
because
the
jury
found
for
us
on
the
--
on
the
2
(a)
question.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
for
separate
amounts
against
each
of
them
and
for
separate
litigation
expenses
as
i
had
given
them
to
the
court.
that
is
correct.
the
three
of
them
aggregated
approximately
350.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
after
the
judge
had
covered
the
amount
on
the
jury's
verdict,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
represent
the
trebling
by
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
well,
the
actual
--
the
actual
breakdown
justice
stewart
is
as
against
continental,
$74,000
and
$14,000
for
litigation
expenses,
totaling
88,
as
against
pet,
$44,000
which
was
trebled
to
a
$132,000
and
$20,000
for
litigation
expenses,
as
against
carnation,
trebled
the
amount
of
$87,000
with
$16,000
for
litigation
expenses.
now,
actually
all
that
was
done
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
to
take
a
$50,000
attorney
fee
awarded
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
then
allocated
of
course
to
the
amount
of
the
judge.
it
was
an
allocation
made
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
the
way,
that's
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
both
the
money
award
and
the
decree
on
the
ground
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
the
prohibited
effect.
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
of
injury
to
competition.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
it
was
determined
as
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
that's
correct
sir.
however,
it
doesn't
mean
that
in
determining
the
situation
with
respect
to
one
that
you
have
to
ignore
the
evidence
after
the
evidence.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
competitive
picture
as
a
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
they
can
be
separately
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
it
had
gone
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no.
you
don't
have
to
read
all
of
that
at
all.
they're
the
first
three
volumes
of
all
of
the
testimony.
the
briefs
then
make
a
specific
record
as
to
that
record
and
all
it
really
has
to
be
read
in
those
briefs
in
those
first
three
volumes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
one
of
the
very
expensive
thing,
if
your
honor
please,
it
cost
the
petitioner
50,000
--
$50,000.
but
the
only
question
here
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
the
issues
--
the
issues
for
the
court,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
sufficient
and
this
was
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
--
to
the
jury.
now,
as
just
a
practical
matter,
there
were
some
problems
about
cooperation
among
counsel
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
because
that
leads
to
incriminations.
and
i
think
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
contributed
to
this
record
being
as
long
as
it
was.
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
present
whether
there
are
three,
four,
five
volumes
of
nothing
but
invoices.
and
then
you
have
to
look
at
all
those
invoices,
we
have
made
a
table
of
the
invoices
as
a
matter
of
appendices
in
our
brief.
now,
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
--
and
we
have
documented
that
data
to
every
invoice
in
the
record
that
if
there's
any
question
about
whether
our
statement
is
correct,
it
is
there
and
since
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
--
i
don't
recall
any
difference
to
these
opinions
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
believe
that
is
the
situation.
however,
as
i
say
don't
think
anybody,
you
have
to
reorder
all
those
invoices.
we
have
simply
documented
them
and
let
them
there
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
presented
to
that
jury
is
the
issue
--
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
we
--
we
are
--
we
are
hopeful
of
course.
if
in
terms
of
enforcement
and
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
that
private
litigation
in
the
antitrust
laws
that
i
think
that
had
some
--
some
important
here,
but
as
i
say
an
explanation
of
why
it
was
necessary
to
print
all
that
i
think
involves
a
question
of
whether
there
were
certain
cooperation
between
counsel
at
the
trial
level
and
the
--
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
probable
to
get
in
--
into
that
question
at
the
moment.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
i
think
it's
all
done
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
no.
nothing
says
that
have
to
be
done
mr.
justice
brennan
but
there
was
a
certain
cloudiness
about
this
whole
question
about
when
you
present
tabulations
even
in
the
trial
court
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
to
have
all
of
the
underlying
records
there.
now,
the
decisions
go
both
ways
on
them
and
until
it's
definitely
clarified,
i
think
a
plaintiff
particularly
at
a
certain
cert
i
think
a
plaintiff
has
to
do
it
safely.
and
if
he
has
4000
invoices
and
he
has
a
tabulation
as
we've
had
this
case,
on
those
invoices,
it
might
be
alright
to
put
the
tabulation
in
and
leave
the
invoices
out.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
then
get
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
if
the
underlying
documents
aren't
here
then
they
fully
rejected
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
made
an
attempt
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
made
an
attempt
to
file
an
--
to
file
the
invoices
as
original
records
in
this
court
and
as
i
understand
that
from
my
associates
that
there
was
correspondence
or
some
conversation
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
on
this
matter.
as
i
understand
it
from
my
associates
the
view
was
taken
that
they
couldn't
be
filed
as
original
records
because
they
were
photostat
or
which
is
more
convenient
we
use
photostats
of
these
invoices
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
we
didn't
apply
it
to
the
court.
we
did
talk
about
them
and
we
did
talk
about
this
matter
with
the
clerk.
and
the
clerk
indicated
we
could
then
file
them
as
original
--
as
original
document
and
i
don't
believe
that
our
--
that
we
did
apply
it
to
court.
however,
i
--
i
do
point
out
that
you
don't
have
to
read
the
whole
of
the
record.
if
that
is
documented
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
we
try
to
get
this
in
as
original
records.
as
i
say
under
your
rules
and
perhaps
it
was
to
the
deficiency
on
our
part
that
we
dealt
with
the
clerk
rather
than
with
the
court.
and
then
i
have
to
say
that
no
question
about
any
--
any
--
the
cor
--
for
the
great
courtesy
we'd
had
from
the
clerk
that
he
was
perhaps
right
in
interpreting
the
rule
as
he
saw
at
that
time,
his
understanding
of
it.
the
court
of
appeals
took
88
pages
breaking
a
volume,
took
88
pages,
printed
pages,
in
order
to
tell
us
that
we
didn't
have
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
apparent
just
from
reading
the
88
pages
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
were
some
wrestling
with
facts
and
some
resolution
of
factual
issues
where
there
was
rather
sharp
conflict
in
the
evidence.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
enters
this
judgment
in
may
of
1965.
we
applied
the
certiorari
in
august
of
1965
and
it
was
granted.
the
--
all
of
the
petition
was
granted
and
we
simply
asked
a
review
on
the
basic
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
had
just
served
that
function
of
the
jury
in
this
case.
and
the
court
added
the
procedural
points
involved
in
the
judgment
n.
o.
v.
and
the
applicability
of
rule,
rule
15.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
three
national
large
corporations,
the
pet
milk
company,
the
carnation
company,
and
the
continental
baking
company.
this
is
a
section
2
(a)
primary,
line
price
discrimination
case.
it
was
brought
by
the
petitioner
against
the
competitors,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
the
conspiracy
account
was
rejected
by
the
jury.
in
addition
to
that,
the
respondent,
continental
had
a
--
and
this
is
important
point
when
we
come
to
consider
the
procedural
issue.
now,
the
counterclaim
against
the
petitioner
in
which
the
licensed
petitioner
had
violated
section
2
(a)
to
its
damage,
the
jury
agreed
and
said
that
the
petitioner
have
in
fact
violated
section
2
(a)
to
its
damage
and
awarded
damages
of
one
dollar
to
the
respondent
continental.
we
made
a
motion
for
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
the
trial
court
who
granted
that
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
was
error
and
remanded
that
case
for
a
new
trial.
that,
however,
is
not
before
this
court;
the
only
thing
that
is
before
this
court
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
for
two-way
and
the
procedural
points
that
have
been
raised.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
other
two
did
not
file
a
counterclaim,
just
continental
and
they
got
a
dollar
from
the
jury,
the
trial
court
granted
a
motion
n.
o.
v.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
it
and
come
down
on
the
ground
of
no
motion
for
a
directive
verdict
as
they
say.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
or
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
now,
that's
not
before
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
before
this.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
on
that,
we
did
not.
i
think
that
was
just
a
factual
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
injurious
impact
shown
even
conceding
the
violation
and
the
--
the
trial
court
ruled
down
that
ground
that
even
conceding
the
violation
of
no
injurious
impact
on
the
respondents.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
we
hope
that
you
will
never
have
to
reach
that
point
if
perhaps
therefore
we
weren't
the
best
advocates
on
that
point
that
we
--
we
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
point.
in
this
case,
we
are
prepared
to
discuss
--
that
will
discuss
it.
so
as
we
have
some
views
about
the
matter.
and
so
far
as
the
factual
situation,
i'm
not
going
to
detail
the
facts
but
simply
to
give
you
the
ultimate,
the
highlights
of
what
was
proven
in
this
record
because
i
think
it
clearly,
under
any
kind
of
fact,
it's
clearly
sufficient
to
have
stand
the
verdict
of
this
jury.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
small
family
enterprise
then
operating
in
the
intermountain
area
for
some
30
years.
the
respondents
on
the
other
hand
are
all
national
concerns
and
the
product
we're
talking
about
is
frozen
pie.
the
frozen
pie
business
meant
little
if
anything
to
this
national
concerns.
it
was
a
small
part
of
what
they
did.
but
so
far
as
its
petitioner
was
concerned,
it
was
everything
of
what
this
is.
the
petitioner
started
in
the
pie
business,
then
when
people
started
buying
frozen
pies
instead
of
fresh
pies,
it
naturally
evolved
into
the
frozen
pies
that
it
had
been
in
the
salt
lake
are
for
some
30
years.
all
of
the
respondents
on
the
other
hand
got
into
the
business
by
acquiring
independent
firms,
all
of
them,
got
into
the
business
in
that
manner.
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
an
unsubstantiated
statement
made
by
one
of
the
witnesses
to
be
affected
there.
by
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case
there
were
200
companies
involved
in
the
pie
business
in
the
united
states.
however,
that
ignores
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
record
of
some
rather
clear
concentration
in
this
industry.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
frozen
pie,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
only
product
we're
talking
about
are
frozen
fruit
pies
plus
mince
and
pumpkins,
we
exclude
the
cream
and
the
chocolate
pie
definitely.
we're
talking
about
the
frozen
fruit
pie.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
basically
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
eight-inch
basically
was
involved
here
although
there
was
some
evidence
of
the
nine-inch
pie
in
the
industry.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
in
--
in
the
san
francisco
market
on
the
nine-inch
pie
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
eight-inch
is
the
basic,
the
standard
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
size
we're
talking
about.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
is
diameter,
i
guess.
now,
we
have
a
lot
of
conversation
about
the
ounces
and
weights
in
this
case.
the
--
in
terms
of
concentration,
here's
what
the
record
shows
without
any
contradiction,
that
as
of
1961
in
the
trading
area
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner,
we're
going
to
come
to
that
as
to
what
that
means
in
a
moment.
but
as
of
1961
the
parties
before
the
court
right
now
did
92%
of
all
of
the
business
in
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
trading
area,
immediately
around
this
plant.
petitioner
being
the
only
one
that
has
a
plant
in
this
area.
all
the
other
had
plants
that
were
distantly
removed,
that's
92%.
and
on
the
national
level
four
companies
had
approximately
two-thirds
of
all
the
business.
and
the
petitioners
were
three
of
those
four
companies,
so
the
cavalier
statements
that
there
are
200
--
200
companies
in
this
business
ought
not
to
me
in
the
light
of
this
uncontradicted
evidence
that
there
wasn't
a
serious
concentration
in
this
business
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
in
terms
of
selling
practices,
the
petitioners
sold
on
an
f.
o.
b.
basis,
fast
break,
all
of
the
respondents
sold
on
a
delivered
price
basis,
all
of
them
within
geographic
zones.
and
while
the
zones
weren't
--
weren't
exactly
the
same
with
respect
to
all
of
the
respondents,
there
were
some
similarity
or
some
substantial
equivalence
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
that
they
use
on
their
prices.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
question
of
the
trading
territory
is
important
in
this
case.
it
sold
under
the
terms
of
this
evidence,
it
sold
in
the
state
of
utah,
idaho,
washington,
some
montana,
some
colorado.
that
is
the
trading.
this
was
defined
in
the
evidence
of
the
three.
and
when
we
talk
about
the
utah
trading
area
regardless
of
where
it
was
set
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
a
shorthand
expression
for
saying
it
that
way
instead
of
making
a
--
reciting
a
let
be
all
of
these
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
those
figures
--
the
study
was
made
by
the
respondents
themselves
applied
to
the
heart
of
that
trading
area
that
is
the
area
immediately
around
salt
lake,
utah,
and
southern
idaho.
the
record
doesn't
show
the
figures
for
these
larger
areas
but
it
does
show
the
two-thirds
figures
i've
mentioned
for
the
national,
for
the
area
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
relevant
market
as
defined
is
the
market
of
utah,
idaho,
washington,
montana,
and
colorado.
that
is
the
market
that
was
presented
to
this
jury
that
the
market
upon
which
in
which
the
discrimination
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
for
the
entire
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
for
the
immediate
area
of
utah
and
southern
idaho.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
--
i
don't
do
--
but
the
gravamen
in
the
--
it's
--
it's
--
what
we
were
talking
about,
we
--
our
complaint
is
that
wherever
the
plaintiff
traded,
they
indulged
in
this
discriminatory
practices
for
the
purpose
of
getting
in
place.
this
is
our
complaint.
now,
while
obviously,
the
plaintiff
is
about
two-thirds
maybe
of
his
business
in
the
immediate
area
behind
the
plant.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
he
did
try
to
trade
in
the
denver
market
and
did
trade
in
the
denver
market.
he
did
try
to
trade
in
the
northwest
market
and
did
trade
there.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
they
--
they
certainly
would
be
different
than
they
are
in
the
--
in
the
sherman
act
case
as
yet.
i
think
they
are
the
same
as
they
are
in
the
section
7,
clayton
act
cases,
and
section
3
of
the
clayton
act,
and
section
2,
the
one
we're
operating
at.
they're
different
i
think
than
the
sherman
act
because
these
are
incipiency
tests.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well
we
have
--
we
have
shown
the
market
shares
for
most
of
the
area
based
on
a
study
made
by
the
respondents
themselves.
but
we
do
have
the
market
shares
and
--
and
in
these
circumstances
where
you
have
the
only
independents
that
markets
in
this
area.
the
only
independent
being
utah
pie,
i
--
i
don't
think
when
you
have
all
of
the
evidence
together
there's
much
question
about
the
injury
to
competition,
not
only
the
possibility
of
injury
but
the
actual
injury
to
competition.
i
think
that
this
complaint
then
was
filed
in
september
of
1961
shortly
after
the
respondent
continental
came
into
the
utah
trading
area
with
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
united
states.
it
was
about
35%
lower
than
the
price
charged
by
these
plants.
now,
to
begin
with,
all
of
the
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
admits
the
price
differences
or
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
price
differences
or
price
discrimination
that
simply
said
that
there
--
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
of
the
prohibited
effect,
so
that
we
start
out
with
an
admission
by
all
of
them
that
there
were
a
price
differences.
in
addition
to
the
territorial
price
cutting
or
the
territorial
price
differences
and
the
lower
price
was
further
removed
from
the
plant
itself.
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
these
low
prices
were
prices
below
cost,
that
they
sold
to
the
loss
in
these
areas,
substantial
evidence
on
that.
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
the
low
prices
were
specifically
aimed
at
this
petitioner,
specifically
aimed
at
this
petitioner.
there
was
substantial
evidence
of
predatory
intent
by
all
of
the
respondents
and
we
review
that
just
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
facts
in
a
moment.
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
the
petitioner
itself
suffered
an
injurious
impact
in
terms
of
price
erosion,
loss
of
market
share,
loss
of
volume,
and
damage
to
the
goodwill
or
the
going
concern
value
of
petitioner.
before
going
into
each
of
these
separately,
that
is
pet,
continental,
and
carnation,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word,
another
word
about
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
began
the
freezing
of
pies
in
august
of
1957
after
having
been
in
the
business
for
some
30
years.
in
the
instilling
four
years
up
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
it
sold
in
utah,
idaho,
nevada,
wyoming,
montana,
colorado,
california,
oregon,
washington,
that
area.
and
that
was
described
as
a
relevant
market
area
by
the
economist
for
the
respondents,
mr.
anderson.
in
september
of
1958,
the
petitioner
built
a
new
plant,
and
it
was
a
good
plant
and
it
was
an
efficient
plant
and
the
evidence
on
that
is
rather
dramatic.
one
of
the
respondents,
the
pet
company
had
the
manager
of
its
frozen
food
departments
sneak
into
the
plant
by
fraudulent
means.
we'll
discuss
it
in
a
moment
when
we
talk
about
predatory
intent.
and
he
writes
a
report
about
that
plant,
and
he
said
it's
a
good
plant,
it's
efficiently
run,
and
i
can
see
in
his
words
why
this
plant
is
the
only
real
competition
we
have
for
the
safeway
business.
but
there
isn't
any
question
here
about
the
ability
in
terms
of
efficient
manager
of
the
petitioner.
and
i
think
this
has
some
importance
with
the
whole
question
of
competitive
impact.
with
respect
to
pet,
pet
got
into
the
business,
the
respondent
pet
will
take
the
cases
in
that
order,
pet,
carnation,
and
continental,
which
is
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
took
it.
pet
got
into
the
business
by
acquiring
an
independent
competitor
in
michigan.
they're
after
its
milk
plants
in
california
and
pennsylvania.
so
as
far
a
pet
is
concerned
it
has
its
plants
in
california,
pennsylvania
and
michigan,
and
it
served
the
entire
united
states
from
those
three
plants.
it
is
important
when
you
come
down
and
analyze
how
the
court
of
appeals
regarded
markets
as
just
major
cities.
the
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about
retail
markets
and
not
the
manufacturers
market.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
plants
of
pet
were
in
michigan,
california,
and
pennsylvania.
those
are
the
pet
plants.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
they
served
the
entire
--
entire
country.
in
the
damage
period,
this
company
of
course
made
millions
in
profits
but
it
consistently
sold
at
loss
in
this
trading
area,
so
far
as
its
frozen
food
products
concerned.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
in
so
far
as
the
frozen
pies.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
it
made
million
of
its
overall
business.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
record
shows
that
it
lost
money.
well,
you
mean
whether
it
made
nationally
on
this.
it
lost
for
a
period
of
time
even
nationally,
lost
for
a
period
of
time
even
nationally.
this
was
described
by
the
chief
executive
of
the
pet
company
as
investment
spending.
and
during
the
trial,
we
--
we
think
it's
just
moving
in
on
and
independent.
during
the
trial,
this
was
described
that
selling
at
a
loss
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
franchise
in
a
particular
territory.
now,
there's
an
independent
located
in
that
area
where
you
decide
to
make
this
"investment
spending."
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
a
very
thing
that
section
2
(a)
was
originally
enacted
for
in
1914.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
yes
there
was
a
distinction
in
price.
you
go
and
find
in
appendix
b,
appendix
b
in
our
brief,
you
will
find
a
documented
table,
this
is
where
we
refer
to
all
of
these
invoices,
a
documented
table
of
the
discriminatory
prices
by
pet,
that's
a
comparative
mr.
justice
fortas
of
the
--
of
the
prices
charged
in
california
where
pet
have
a
plant
as
against
the
prices
charged
in
the
utah
trading
area.
that
goes
from
the
date
of
july
of
1959
to
may
of
1961.
now,
that's
a
price
discrimination
predicated
upon
their
quality
pie
having
its
label
called
pet-ritz,
they
were
the
discrimination
between
pet-ritz
and
pet-ritz
in
these
geographical
areas.
in
addition
to
that,
this
pet-ritz
quality
pie
was
sold
to
the
safeway
company
on
what
i
think
is
a
circuit
deal,
we'll
discuss
in
a
moment.
so
the
safeway
company
under
the
safeway
label
of
bel-air.
but
it's
admitted
and
stipulated
in
the
evidence
that
the
exact
pie
sold
on
to
their
quality
label,
they
sold
to
safeway,
the
word
just
simply
thought
at
the
end
of
the
production
line,
you
took
their
quality
label
in
their
own
box
and
you
simply
put
a
safeway
box
to
it.
so
you
had
two
discriminations
there,
just
their
pet-ritz
as
against
pet-ritz
sold
under
that
label,
and
then
pet-ritz
as
against
the
safeway
brand,
the
bel-air
brand.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
at
a
lower
price.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
where
the
plant
was,
750
miles
away.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
later
on
which
is
there
and
so-called
priced
pie
as
against
their
economy
pie.
and
the
evidence
i've
been
encircled
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
simple
simon
was
made
by
carnation
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
at
the
carnation
brand.
so
that
pet
labels
are
pet
--
pet-ritz
and
swiss
miss
and
bel-air
so
far
as
its
packed
for
safeway,
for
safe
--
that
the
bel-air
label
belong
to
the
safeway
company
rather
than
to
the
--
rather
than
to
the
manufacturer.
now,
on
the
--
on
the
safeway
discrimination,
incidentally,
you
have
a
difference
of
about
a
dollar
and
fifty
four
per
dozen,
that
much,
77
cents
for
case
or
a
dollar
fifty
four
per
doz
--
dozen.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
utah
pie
made
some
price
concessions
in
the
record.
this
is
the
basis
on
which
it
was
found
to
have
violated
section
2
(a)
itself.
there
were
some
price
concession
made
but
they
were
minimal
in
terms
of
its
total
business.
actually,
the
price
--
actually
it
sold
generally
on
the
basis
of
the
plant
fast
break,
that
there
was
some
concessions
made
in
order
to
get
the
business.
but
that
--
but
those
concessions
were
not
lower,
if
that
all
and
the
concessions
that
were
being
made
by
the
--
by
the
pet
company.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
was
a
general
pricing
policy
of
the
petitioner
as
distinguished
from
the
respondents
who
had
delivered
price
systems
within
zones
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
as
distinguished
from.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
they
had
a
--
they
have
a
california
zone
in
northwest
--
a
northwest
zone
and
intermountain
zone.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
there
was
a
uniform
--
there
was
a
uniform
delivered
price
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
within
the
zone
and
sometimes
within
two
zones.
and
they
made
concessions
off
of
that.
so
it
is
rather
that
the
lower
prices
were
in
the
utah
trading
area
and
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
country
as
i
say
was
in
salt
lake
city.
the
lowest
price
to
that
is
the
continental
price
is
$2.55
which
precipitated
the
loss.
that's
why
we
brought
the
lawsuit.
now
with
respect
to
the
pet
--
pet-ritz,
bel-air
discrimination
that
is
the
safeway
discrimination,
the
court
of
appeals
gets
around
that
by
making
what
i
--
what
i
think
that
great
difference
can
only
be
described
as
findings
of
facts.
it
says
that
the
safeway
price
discrimination
was
cost
justified.
actually,
the
evidence
showed
a
cost
--
even
an
attempted
cost
justification
for
only
a
minor
part
of
the
period.
and
that
cost
justification
included
among
other
things
the
advertising
justification
which
this
court
rejected
in
the
recent
borden
case.
this
notion
that
there's
a
--
that
there's
a
real
cost
differential
just
because
you
put
the
canned
milk
in
borden
--
borden
can
in
one
instance
and
in
a
private
label,
the
safeway
private
label
in
another
instance.
so
there
was
a
very
great
conflict
in
the
evidence
on
cost
justification
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
to
handle
this
statement
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
i
think
frank
in
saying
that
you
could
misconstrue
the
evidence
unless
you
put
an
improper
perspective,
proper
focus
for
the
language
used.
i
submit
that
that
basically
is
a
jury
question,
putting
the
evidence
in
a
perspective.
that
is
a
finding.
the
inferences
you
derive
from
the
evidence.
but
then
secondly,
and
this
one
will
hurt
a
little
bit,
the
court
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
anyway
because
safeway
was
unwilling
to
buy
from
utah
pie
because
of
the
unwillingness
of
utah
pie
to
put
in
certain
quality
controls.
i
just
--
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
evidence
except
in
terms
of
(inaudible).
on
this
one
i
wanted
to
just
talk
a
little
bit
about
it.
that
you
can
see
what
happened
to
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
says
flatly
safeway
was
unwilling
to
buy
from
you.
i
think
it's
what
the
evidence
showed.
that
sends
its
manager
of
the
frozen
food
division
down
to
salt
lake
city.
it
has
a
meeting
with
some
competitors
in
the
warehouse
down
by
the
railroad
somewhere.
and
he
decides
to
sneak
into
the
plant
of
the
petitioner
by
posing
as
a
broker
from
the
northwest
who
was
interested
in
distributing
the
products
of
the
petitioner
in
the
northwest.so
we
showed
at
the
plant
on
that
--
on
that
basis
and
gain
his
business
to
the
plant.
this
is
the
manager
of
the
frozen
food
division
of
the
pet
company.
he
is
admitted
to
the
pet
plant.
while
he
is
in
there,
he
was
writing
a
report
of
what
he
sees
and
he
said,
"this
is
a
great
plant.
it's
efficiently
managed.
it
has
all
of
the
sanitation.
and
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
a
very
serious
competitor
with
it,
with
a
substance
up
for
the
safeway
business."
then
he
goes
on
further
to
say,
"i
can
see
why
safeway
regards
this
company
as
the
only
plant
that
can
pack
for
it
other
than
ourselves."
i
remember
the
court
of
appeal
said,
safeway
was
unwilling
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
they
had
bought
mince
and
--
and
pumpkin.
there's
a
seasonal
pie,
a
holiday
pie,
not
the
fruit
pie.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
pet
manager
acknowledges
that
safeway
had
finally
told
him
that
this
was
a
one
plant
that
could
compete
for
the
business,
the
petitioner
testified
that
two
days
before
the
surreptitious
plant
visit,
he
had
talked
to
the
safeway
buyer
who
told
him,
"you're
going
to
get
the
business,
go
out
and
buy
the
fruit,"
apples
in
this
case
to
count
through
about
50%
of
the
market.
and
he
said
he
went
out
and
bought
the
apples
on
the
basis
of
that
representation.
the
safeway
buyers
couldn't
understand
and
he
is
asked
whether
or
not
he
in
fact
told
the
pet
people
what
the
memorandum
showed.
that's
its
question
of
word
against
word
or
even
uncontradicted
word
is
a
memorandum,
a
contemporaneous
memorandum
against
what
he
was
going
to
say.
he
said,
"no,
that
isn't
so."
then
at
the
trial
itself
we're
able
to
get
out
of
the
brief
case
of
one
of
the
witnesses
another
memorandum
that
wasn't
produced
during
the
production
period
which
says
about
this
safeway
buyer
whose
credibility
the
court
accepted
as
against
all
of
its
conflict.
this
is
kind
of
a
peculiar
buyer
really,
says,
this
man
young
will
act
as
a
door
opener
for
us,
for
our
sales
personnel.
in
addition,
it
says,
he
is
going
to
send
us
inter-office
memoranda
of
the
safeway
company
but
we
must
never
disclose
that
we
got
it
from
you.
and
these
inter-office
memoranda
will
point
the
way
as
to
the
approach
you
should
make
to
the
safeway
people.
we
ask
the
man
who
wrote
the
memorandum
whether
he
agreed
with
the
buyer
about
that,
his
own
memorandum,
he
said,
"no."
in
other
words,
he
denied
his
own
memorandum.
we
asked
the
safeway
man,
"did
you
make
these
agreements
to
send
your
own
inter-office
memorandum
to
these
people
to
help
them
make
the
sales?"
he
denied
it.
now,
with
that
kind
of
conflict
and
i
say
that
--
did
that
the
--
that
the
inference
is
almost
inevitable.
that
that
was
done
the
court
of
appeals
is
very
gladly
says,
safeway
wasn't
in
a
fight
from
them
anyway.
now,
quality
control
doesn't
mean
sanitation,
it
doesn't
mean
anything
like
that,
it
simply
means
the
bookkeeping
system
to
know
when
a
particular
pie
was
produced.
i
apologized
to
going
into
that
kind
of
detail
but
this
is
one
clear
episode
and
there
are
about
10
of
them
like
this
where
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
the
word
of
a
man
against
the
contemporaneous
documents.
and
this
was
a
very
real
issue
before
the
jury.
we
attacked
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses
and
it
was
argued
by
the
--
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
pet
and
it
was
argued
by
us.
and
we
said
they
ought
to
believe
the
evidence
of
the
documents
and
the
evidence
of
the
plaintiff
who
said
that
safeway
was
going
to
deal
with
it.
well,
in
any
event
they
lost
that
safeway
business.
now,
they
lost
it
in
circumstances
where
there
was
a
contract
between
pet
and
say
"well,
which
we
said
was
the
total
requirements
contract,
this
guy
for
causing
illegal
features.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
they
didn't
get
to
repeat
business
on
it.
they
got
it
once.
but
in
any
event
i
--
i
don't
say
you
have
to
accept
all
our
inference.
this
is
--
all
you
have
to
do
is
see
that
this
was
this
serious
conflict
where
there
obviously
greater
weight
of
evidence
was
on
our
side.
and
of
course
the
breaking
into
plant,
this
was
in
the
burglary
case
or
false
entry
case.
we
claim
to
the
jury
that
they
will
not
be
suede
by
that
fact
that
they
could
use
it
in
terms
of
the
determining
whether
there
was
predatory
intent
against
this
particular
petitioner
and
whether
the
activity,
price
activities
were
motivated
by
that
predatory
intent
because
the
existence
of
the
predatory
intent
is
itself
significant
evidence
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prohibited
effect
was
brought
about.
now,
in
addition
before
leaving
pet,
in
addition
to
the
men
and
the
obvious
men
of
the
station
with
the
predatory
intent,
we
think
they
use
the
swiss
miss
as
kind
of
a
fighting
brand.
but
we
were
accused
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
the
jury
as
simply
using
anti-trust
clichés
as
they
were
called.
and
they
called
this
business
about
breaking
into
the
plant.
the
industrial
espionage
was
in
essence
with
the
word
that
implied
by
the
jury,
we
didn't
make
this
fact.
the
fact
was
made
by
their
own
plant
manager.
now,
so
far
as
swiss
miss
is
concerned,
and
the
court
inquired
about
that
on
a
national
basis
they
sold
their
quality
pie
greatly.
they
volume
of
the
quality
pie
was
greatly
over
the
quality
of
this
swiss
miss
which
was
a
price
pie
of
pure
ounce
of
(voice
overlap)
in
effect,
so
then.
in
this
market,
in
this
trading
area,
now
i'm
talking
about
the
heart
of
the
trading
area,
in
this
market,
swiss
miss
sold
13
to
1
as
against
the
quality
pie.
we
said
they
were
simply
using
it
as
a
fighting
brand
in
that
particular
area.
now,
that
the
jury
have
the
right
to
believe
it
that
way
and
i
say
factual
question
in
any
event
and
right
or
wrong,
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
it
just
in
those
figures.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
and
i
think
the
jury
has
the
right
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
i
think
that's
true
but
when
you're
talking
about
--
when
you're
quality
pies,
i
think
these
were
unlabeled,
there
is
room
to
argue
that.
when
you're
talking
about
these
pies,
price
pie,
the
fact
that
you
have
a
13
to
1
volume
in
this
trading
area
where
they're
carrying
out
all
of
these
other
activities,
don't
view
it
as
an
isolation,
where
they
carry
out
all
of
these
other
activities,
i
think
it's
evident
that
they
are
using
it
as
a
fighting
brand
at
least
the
jury
was
invited
to
conclude
it
was
and
it
was
a
factual
basis
in
which
they
made
that
conclusion.
sure
there
might
be
conflicting
evidence.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
--
that's
the
concept,
it's
true.
they
--
and
then
you
have
to
get
them
here.
they
use
this
cheap
pie
to
get
them
where
they
couldn't
sacrifice
the
quality
pie
too
much.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
--
i
think
there's
some
evidence
of
price
variation
on
swiss
miss
but
not
a
great
deal.
there
is
some
but
--
but
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
use
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
and
the
figures
i
think
show
it
and
there's
nothing
in
the
taste,
the
survey
made
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
matter
of
just
local
practice.
in
any
event
there
were
conflicting
facts
that
the
jury
should
have
made
the
determination
from.
i
don't
say
that
their
facts
were
100%
on
our
side,
there
are
conflict
in
the
evidence.
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
conceding,
that
if
the
verdict
had
been
the
other
way,
i
think
that
we
would
have
had
difficulty
arguing
that
there
was
completed
sufficiency
of
evidence.
it
is
a
matter
of
who
determines
the
factual
question.
somebody
who
sits
and
tries
to
put
things
in
perspective
in
a
library
or
the
jury
that
looked
at
that
safeway
buyer
to
determine
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth
as
against
the
contemporaneous
memorandum
and
as
against
the
--
the
behavior
of
the
pet
witnesses
on
that
stand.
now,
so
far
as
carnation
is
concerned,
carnation
went
into
the
business,
and
i'll
discuss
the
content
of
the
facts
in
a
moment
as
to
all
of
them.
so
far
as
carnation
is
concerned,
it
went
into
the
business
by
again
acquiring
an
independent,
and
that
independent
was
acquired
in
1955
and
it
had
simple
simon,
simple
simon
label.
it
had
a
plant
in
california.
now,
unlike
the
other
two,
it
didn't
sound
nationally
but
it
sold
all
the
way
through
the
mississippi
river
and
some
place
within
the
east,
that's
the
only
distinction
between
the
two
in
terms
of
national
selling
area.
the
lowest
profit
in
any
of
these
years
with
the
carnation
company
was
$18
million
but
it
lost
money
in
the
distribution
of
its
frozen
foods
in
this
area,
so
just
as
pet,
this
is
in
the
case
of
pet,
they
have
multimillion
dollar
profits
but
a
lost
in
this
particular
area
and
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
frozen
foods,
frozen
foods
generally,
frozen
foods
generally
of
which
pies
were
a
substantial
factor.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
is
on
the
frozen
foods.
now,
so
far
as
price
discrimination
is
concerned,
you
will
find
a
tabulation
at
pages
36
and
37
of
the
brief.
not
to
go
into
detail
on
it
because
here
again,
the
price
difference
is
conceded.
you
find
that
tabulation
covering
a
period
from
november
1959
to
september
of
1961,
the
date
we
filed
this
complaint.
and
you
find
that
tabulation
compares
the
northern
california
price,
their
plant
was
located
in
california,
as
against
the
salt
lake
city
area
prices
and
you'll
see
very
substantial
discriminations.
we
also
at
page
39
have
shown
the
number
of
days
of
this
price
discrimination
between
northern
california
and
the
salt
lake,
salt
lake
city
area.
now,
the
carnation
sales
were
at
a
lost,
but
more
than
that
they
were
planned
at
a
lost.
now,
there's
been
some
discussion
about
that
and
i
just
like
to
say
a
word
on
them.
they
say
well
that
if
you're
budget
loses,
that's
simply
somebody
trying
to
make
an
actual
statement
as
what's
likely
to
happen
in
this
market.
on
the
other
hand,
the
jury
can
say
that
they
intentionally
sold
at
a
loss
to
get
a
foothold
and
were
prepared
to
subsidized
those
loses
from
their
overall
price.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
it
is
not
necessary
it's
just
plus
or
velvet
when
you
have
it,
when
you
do
have
the
elements
of
the
intent.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
have
a
specific
intent
to
get
this
particular
competitor
or
a
even
a
specific
intent
to
injure
competition.
if
you
have
the
price
difference
and
the
reasonable
possibility
of
the
effect
is
there,
then
you
don't
need
an
intent.
but
when
you
have
intent
it
would
tend
to
support
the
reasonable
possibility
of
competitive
injury.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
our
view
is
that
they
did
it
both
with
the
intent
and
the
effect
that
the
intent
wasn't
necessary
and
on
a
specific
question
as
to
whether
a
large
conglomerate
company
can
say,
"well,
i'd
like
to
get
in
to
that
area.
so
i'm
going
in
at
a
much
lower
price
and
i
have
at
my
plan.
now,
they're
going
to
transport
of
750
miles
and
go
in
to
the
much
lower
price.
now,
that
lower
price
doesn't
have
to
be
at
a
loss.
but
in
this
case
if
you
prove
it
here
that's
a
loss
i
think
this
is
just
precisely
what
that
section
means
if
the
company
can't
do
it,
if
there's
a
strong
independent
located
in
that
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
is
what
i
think
it
means,
yes.
now,
with
a
conglomerate
company
if
it
goes
into
an
area
and
it
knows
that
there's
an
independent
in
that
area,
they
are
distinguished
from
competing
with
pet
or
as
distinguished
from
competing
with
continental
and
it
knows
that
the
effect
of
what
its
doing
say
as
to
put
that
company
out
of
business
even
or
to
injure
it
or
to
impair
its
capital
structure,
i
see
this
is
exactly
what
2
(a)
means
that
you
can't
do
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
the
original
one,
just
to
compare
to
the
original
2
(a)
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
you
pointed
out
in
our
lower
courts,
2
(a)
involved
and
attempt
to
get
what
was
disclosed
in
the
tobacco
and
standard
oil
cases
of
this
overtrading
by
a
large
national
company
or
a
company
with
great
financial
resources
in
a
local
area
where
the
price
is
cut
just
at
that
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
the
difference
in
prices
in
two
--
a
territorial
one
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
is
a
primary
line
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
in
the
primary
line
cases
that
price
difference
is
a
price
in
california,
that's
a
price
against
salt
lake
city.
and
nobody
was
trying
to
insulate
this
up
which
they
claim
as
the
court
of
appeals
claim
from
competition.
anybody
was
privileged
to
go
up
there
and
build
a
plant
or
to
compete
in
any
other
way
but
i
think
the
statute
says
you
can't
go
in
there
and
sell
at
a
loss
to
the
--
where,
where
the
effect
is
to
injure
that
independent.
so
incidentally
their
own
--
their
own
economic
witness,
dr.
anderson
that
the
sales
by
a
large
conglomerate
corporation
a
loss
planned
in
advance
was
evidence
about
ulterior
motive
as
he
put
it,
evidence
of
less
than
perfect
competition
or
unnatural
pricing
as
he
also
put
it.
and
he
also
said
that
the
lower
price
could
be
predatory
"as
one
of
the
possibility".
he's
their
own
witness.
i
say
this
evidence
was
before
that
jury.
now,
with
respect
to
continen
--
i'll
carry
along
with
that
and
get
to
the
procedural
problem.
continental
as
the
other
two
got
into
the
business
by
buying
an
independent
in
1955.
the
sales
of
this
company
in
the
period
of
1958
to
1961,
the
overall
sales
were
in
excess
of
a
half
billion
dollars.
the
profits
were
$75
million
but
it's
sold
at
a
loss
in
the
utah
trading
area.
now,
pet
and
continental
were
the
two
largest
sellers
in
the
united
states.
in
continental,
there
was
an
evidence
that
continental
was
a
price
leader.
from
1958
to
1961,
its
frozen
foods
department
operated
a
loss
despite
these
other
process
and
specifically
what
prospective
--
that
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
united
states
as
the
evidence
showed
was
by
continental
in
salt
lake
city.
continental
had
its
plant
in
virginia,
they
had
a
plant
in
iowa,
it
have
a
custom
packing
arrangement
in
california.
continental
too
sold
on
a
deliberate
price
basis
within
geographic
zones.
now,
with
respect
to
predatory
intent
and
this
again,
the
court
of
appeals
treats
us
though
there
wasn't
any
conflict
in
the
evidence.
the
broker
of
continental
told
the
petitioner
that
i
am
going
to
run
you
out
of
business,
broker
of
continental,
only
that
i
do
that.
and
then
shortly
after
telling
that
for
a
period
from
june
16
to
august
12
of
1961
continental
instituted
the
lowest
price
in
the
entire
united
states
on
frozen
pies
in
a
transaction
with
the
safeway
company
which
is
extended
to
us.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
accepts
the
statement
made
by
a
respondent
that
this
was
just
a
two-week
deal.
that
this
needs
a
little
analysis,
first
of
all
it
wasn't
two
weeks,
that
that
price
of
$2.55
admittedly
below
cost
or
at
least
substantial
evidence
that
it
was
below
cost.
that
price
lasted
from
june
16
to
august
12,
and
was
the
thing
that
precipitated
this
lawsuit.
when
you
sell
a
six-week
supply
and
the
evidence
was
that
even
though
there
were
two
sales,
it
was
a
six-week
supply,
when
you
sell
a
six-week
supply
simply
like
the
safeway
company,
you
don't
have
a
six-week
effect
on
the
price
structure.
it
may
take
a
year
to
get
over
the
injury
that
a
six-week
price
with
the
safeway
company
can
bring
about.
and
this
was
argued
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
was
invited
to
assess
this
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
injury
to
the
competition.
this
price
incidentally
was
35%
lower
than
the
price
the
same
company
sold
in
california
at
the
same
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
it
was
that
at
the
end
safeway
or
morton.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
period.
morton
kind
of
stayed
out
of
these
markets
for
awhile.
it
was
in
1958,
it
kind
of
stayed
out
and
then
after
this
broker
had
this
conversation,
they
came
in
with
this
low
price.
now,
there's
admittedly
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
broker
was
employed
by
continental
at
the
time
of
the
conversation
where
he
told
the
plaintiff
he
was
going
to
get
them.
but
there's
a
conflict.
the
written
document
shows
that
he
was,
the
oral
testimony
says
he
was
not,
he
was
employed
a
few
weeks
later.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
actually.
but
there
was
a
conflict
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
resolved
that
conflict,
it
was
for
the
jury
to
resolve.
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
wholesale
elimination
from
this
evidence
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
is
the
1935
amendment,
that
last
portion
you've
read.
we
are
claiming
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
of
injury
to
competition
under
the
incipiency
test.
that
was
all
that's
required.
now,
later
on
for
treble
damage
purposed
you
do
have
to
show
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
(voice
overlap)
-
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
relying
on
that
last
clause,
that
in
other
words
we
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
here
of
injury
to
com
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
except
that
under
the
general
injury
to
competition,
we
claim
that
we
were
unable
to
get
the
safeway
contract
because
of
these
price
discriminations.
we
were
unable
to
expand
into
the
--
into
the
denver
area
over
and
above
what
we
did
there,
unable
to
expand
into
the
northwest
area.
but
i
think
that
the
test
so
far
as
the
primary
line
is
concerned,
the
test
is
far
and
this
is
the
test
we
submitted
to
the
jury
in
--
that
proposed
in
the
instructions
which
the
court
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
test
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
court
--
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
this
--
this
question
is
whether
there
has
to
be
injury
to
competition
or
injury
to
a
competitor.
it
is
you
know
a
question
that's
presently
engaging
the
courts.
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
in
this
--
in
this
situation.
for
this
reason,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it's
quite
obvious
that
injury
to
this
plaintiff
is
injury
to
competition
because
this
plaintiff
is
the
only
substantial
independent
competitor
in
the
area.
it's
the
only
one.
there
aren't
any
others.
so
that
injury
to
this
plaintiff
is
substantial
injury
to
competition.
now,
the
court
properly
instructed
that
its
injury
to
competition
you
must
find,
not
just
injury
to
a
competitor.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i
don't
think
in
the
con
--
i
think
that
could
be
so
in
another
case
but
not
in
the
context
of
the
facts
we
have
here.
the
areas
we're
talking
about,
the
--
the
injury
--
the
injury
to
this
particular
competitor
resulted
in
an
erosion
of
its
price
structure,
that's
one.
but
more
importantly,
it
precluded
here
from
expanding
his
distribution
in
the
northwest
area,
it
precluded
him
from
expanding
his
distribution
in
the
denver
area.
now,
on
--
with
specifically
with
respect
to
the
denver
area
which
the
court
of
appeals
read
out
of
the
case
entirely
or
just
let
me
say
a
word
on
that
because
i
think
it
fits
in
with
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white.
the
pretrial
order
in
this
case
was
very
explicit
on
the
back
that
we
were
talking
about
colorado.
here
it
was
not.
there
was
price
discrimination
in
the
record
as
you
will
see
in
appendix
c
in
the
brief
between
denver,
colorado
and
areas
and
other
areas
for
the
morton
company,
very
clear
price
discrimination.
we
introduced
that
evidence.
it
was
argued
to
the
jury.
we
had
information
on
damages;
on
our
damage
exhibit,
we
had
damages
for
the
denver
area.
we
have
a
witness
who
examined
on
the
denver
area.
the
counsel
for
continental
cross-examined
that
damage
witness
on
the
denver
area.
i
argue
that
to
the
jury,
they
argued
it
to
the
jury.
the
form
of
the
verdict
simply
said,
utah
trading
area
and
throughout,
we
have
talked
about
that
meaning
as
the
area
in
which
the
plaintiff
distributes
or
sells
its
pies
despite
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
denver
wasn't
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
possibly
come
to
that
conclusion.
when
judge
wheeler
framed
his
decree,
this
is
how
much
he
thought
that
was
in
the
case.
he
says
that
the
violation
occurred
in
the
plaintiff's
trading
area
(utah,
idaho,
washington,
montana,
and
colorado,
as
against
california),
where
the
defendant's
production
facilities
are
located.
and
then
he
decree
that
there
should
be
no
lower
prices
in
utah,
idaho,
washington,
montana,
and
colorado
than
in
california
or
in
the
case
of
continental
for
the
state
of
colorado
the
prices
charged
in
iowa.
now,
how
in
the
line
of
that
record,
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
that
denver
wasn't
in
this
case
when
it
states
it.
it
specifically
says
that
because
now
the
damage
exhibit
1
to
that
jury
and
judge
told
the
--
told
the
jury
consider
that
damage
exhibit
with
denver
on
it
and
was
cross-examined
because
the
form
of
verdict
said
utah
trading
area,
the
judge
says
that
means
the
state
of
utah
in
effect
or
the
immediate
area
upon.
and
i
submit
in
any
event
that
--
that
that
the
trial
court
understood
it
differently.
obviously,
counsel
for
the
respondents
understood
it
differently,
he
crossed-examined
on
that
damage
exhibit
relating
to
denver.
the
denver
invoices
are
in
the
record,
they
are
in
evidence
and
on
that
basis,
i
submit
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
point
simply
couldn't
put
that
denver
picture
in
into
perspective
or
focus
as
we
call
it
and
eliminated
the
whole
sale
from
the
case.
now
the
--
finally,
we
think
the
evidence
showed
injurious
impact,
i
think,
were
required
in
the
private
damage
action
to
show
the
elements
of
violation
of
injurious
impact
and
not
that
economic
evidence
in
this
record
to
justify
the
damage
awards,
and
i
think
the
damage
awards
are
rather
conservative
in
this
case.
there
was
a
price
erosion
from
a
$4
level
to
a
$3
level
in
the
period
of
time
that
was
before
the
jury
and
whether
this
price
erosion
was
the
effect
of
the
competitive
practices
of
the
respondents
was
for
the
jury
to
say
and
the
jury
found
it
our
way,
in
that
respect.
there
were
reduced
volumes.
it
started
out
with
its
prime
advertised
brand
at
70%
in
1958.
the
court
of
appeals
made
several
marks
about
this
almost
approaching
monopoly,
but
in
the
regional
if
you
have
a
regional
company,
the
only
plant
in
the
area
you
would
expect
that
volume
immediately
around
its
plant
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
but
its
market
share
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
went
down
from
70
if
you
say
what
happened
to
it,
went
down
from
70
to
58
to
40
to
33
on
the
advertised
brands.
and
we
asked
the
economic
witness
of
respondents,
don't
you
think
that
that
kind
of
a
loss
on
the
advertised
brand
is
a
competitive
injury?
does
the
--
the
--
the
manufacturer's
advertised
brand?
and
they
said,
"yes,
it
was."
and
those
figures
were
in
that
record.
and
its
overall
share
declined
from
66
to
34
to
45,
45
in
a
four-year
period
at
a
percentage
arrangement.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
level
is
actually
below
the
$3
level.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
when
continental
came
in
with
a
very
lowest
price
that
was
ever
charged
anywhere
in
the
entire
united
states,
we
came
down
and
met
that
price.
at
the
time
that
it
was
charging
this
$2.55
price,
to
use
the
actual
figures
in
salt
lake
city
had
this
--
in
a
california
sale
of
about
the
same
day
maybe
even
the
same
day
or
the
day
after
it
was
charging
$4
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
there
was
some
evidence
that
--
well,
the
--
the
$4
price
was
there
in
the
fax
mar
--
in
the
fax
market
invoice
in
california
in
1961.
they
may
have
been
other
places
in
the
country
where
there
was
a
lower
price
but
in
california
where
the
plant
was
located
that
$4
price
is
still
obtained.
now,
one
of
the
ways
that
the
court
gets
around
that
is
by
saying,
"well
they
were
advertising
allowances
which
we
are
going
to
regard
as
a
price
cut."
there
was
substantial
evidence
by
the
respondents
if
their
advertising
allowances
were
in
price
cuts,
if
they
got
a
quid
pro
quo
for
their
advertising
allowance.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
in
the
case
of
that
--
when
we're
talking
about
the
comparison
of
the
$2.55
price
against
the
$4
price,
there
were
$2.55
price
which
then
involved
advertising
allowances.
it
was
just
a
price
cut.
now,
that
$4
price
may
have
had
some
advertising
allowances
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
and
that
would
standardized
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
it's
not
subject
to
reduction
if
it's
an
advertising
allowance.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
mean
it's
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
if
you
--
if
you
say
that
the
advertising
allowance
is
a
price
cut,
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
if,
as
the
evidence
shows
and
there
was
--
and
there
was
not
much
conflict
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
with
respect
to
specific
invoices
of
the
periods
that
time,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
don't
recall
that
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
from
special
promotions,
some
of
the
carnation
did
but
10
to
20
cents
a
case
was
a
little
more
logical.
now,
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
the
--
just
let
me
say
including
this
whole
matter
that
--
there
was
this
abundant
evidence
here
of
predatory
intent,
that
this
prices
were
aimed
specifically
at
these
company,
the
--
the
fraudulent
entry
into
the
plant,
the
transactions
with
the
safeway
company,
there
was
a
permanent
diversion
of
business
here,
evidence
of
a
permanent
diversion
of
business
as
a
substantial
disparity
inside
the
courts
between
them.
there
were
sales
below
cost,
there's
abundant
evidence
here
to
define
predatory
intent
and
i
think
therefore
abundant
evidence
in
the
light
of
the
injurious
impact
on
this
petitioner
and
the
only
independent
in
the
whole
area,
abundant
evidence
of
the
prohibited
effect.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
oh!
yes.
we
very
seriously
challenge
a
great
number
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
there
are
--
there
are
some
factual
inaccuracies
which
we
have
noted
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
your
assumption
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
yes.
this
is
one
of
--
this
is
one
of
them.
i
--
i
would
say
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i
would
put
it
this
way
with
justice
black
by
and
large
i
think
the
facts
stated
by
the
court
are
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
not
when
you
come
to
the
safeway
transactions,
no.
not
when
you
come
to
the
pet-safeway
transactions
except
for
that
--
except
for
the
denver
i
think
then
substantially
yes.
so,
on
the
pet-safeway
transactions,
no.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
no,
no.
first
of
all
there
are
abundant
omissions,
if
--
if
your
question
comprehends
to,
mr.
justice
black,
omissions.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i
would
say
that
you'd
have
because
they
were
substantial
omissions,
we
think
the
fact
that
are
just
plain
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that
the
facts
stated
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
the
facts
stated
are
substantially
correct
except
for
the
safeway
transaction,
the
denver
transaction,
and
the
fact
that
there
are
substantial
omissions,
for
example,
this
decline
in
market
share
on
the
private
brands
doesn't
appear
in
the
court's
opinion.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
substantial
omission,
very
substantial
omission.
what
went,
well
--
well,
we
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
--
the
inference
or
competitive
injury
here
is
the
--
and
of
course
there's
a
substantial,
i
must
say
again
that
when
the
court
comes
to
say
what
the
absolute
prices
are,
their
substantial
difference
on
a
factual
basis
because
of
the
advertising
allowance
problem,
substantial
difference
on
that.
i
was
about
to
come
to
the
procedural
questions
involved
in
this
--
in
this
case.
what
happened
to
--
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
was
requested
in
the
trial
court
and
a
new
trial
was
requested
and
it
was
denied.
on
appeal,
the
court
said
that
the
judgment
n.
o.
v.
should
have
been
granted.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
--
upon
the
procedural
point
relating
to
a
new
trial.
i
am
afraid
that
the
law
in
this
general
area
at
the
moment
is
such
that
when
you
look
at
slocum,
at
redmond,
at
cone,
and
then
at
hennegan,
that
the
bar
and
perhaps
the
bench
could
be
a
little
bit
confused
and
under
the
general
rules
that
ordinarily
the
trial
court
has
to
obey
the
dictate
of
a
--
of
a
court
of
appeals,
the
trial
court
in
this
instance
may
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
cannot
grant
a
new
trial.
but
i
think
obviously
it
should
be
permitted
to
do
so.
now,
we
have
this
anomaly
if
in
terms
of
practical
courtroom
mechanics,
we
have
this
anomaly
in
the
law.
we've
won
this
verdict,
let's
take
this
case.
we
won
the
verdict,
the
judgment
was
entered.
they
made
a
proper
motion
n.
o.
v.
it
was
denied.
if
it
had
been
granted
at
the
trial
level,
we
could
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
nobody
would
question
that.
now,
then
if
instead
of
being
granted
at
the
trial
level,
it's
granted
at
the
appellate
level
then
it's
the
contention
of
the
other
side
and
we
submit
it's
wrong
that
we
can't
have
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
by
winning
below,
we're
prejudiced,
now
that
--
it
doesn't
seem
that
it
ought
to
be
right.
it
is
on
our
position
that
this
court
can
make
all
of
these
cases
consistent
by
simply
saying
that
of
course
the
trial
court
must
obey
the
dictates
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
enter
its
judgment
n.o.v.
but
once
it
has
done
so,
there
ought
to
be
no
difference
on
the
new
trial
procedure
whether
that
judgment
was
entered
on
the
initiative
of
the
trial
court
or
on
the
initiative
of
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
i
think
clearly
indicates
there's
justice
in
letting
the
trial
court
make
that
final
determination.
one
of
the
usual
grounds
for
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
newly
discovered
evidence.
that
evidence
could
be
discovered
even
after
the
court
of
appeals
comes
down
with
a
direction
to
enter
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
and
there's
no
reason
why
within
the
ten-day
period,
the
loser
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
that
ground
or
any
other
ground
that
is
available
to
him.
we
know
of
no
case,
and
i
submit
those
cited
by
respondents
don't
really
hit
this
point.
and
we
know
of
no
statute
which
expressly
precludes
the
trial
court
from
granting
a
new
trial
after
it
enters
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
we
know
of
no
case
that
does
it.
the
original
judicial
coach
here
gives
the
court
of
appeals
power
and
authority
to
reverse
a
judgment.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
can't
add
to
that
judgment
and
you
may
not
in
any
circumstance
grant
a
new
trial.
it
doesn't
say
that,
it
just
says
that
you
can
reverse.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
you
appear
to
have
done
that
of
course
in
hennegan
and
this
i
think
it
was
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
confusion.
i
think
if
you
take
the
literal
language
of
50
(c)
(2)
that
the
answer
would
be
yes.
in
the
final
analysis
it's
not
this
court
that
enters
that
judgment
n.
o.
v.
or
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
that
trial
court.
he
finally
said
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct,
alright.
now,
then
50
(c)
(2)
makes
no
distinction
at
least
in
its
language
regardless
of
what
those
framers
intended
makes
no
distinction
between
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
entered
on
the
initiative
of
the
trial
court
or
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
entered
at
the
direction
of
an
appellate
court.
it
makes
no
distinction
at
all,
so
i
say
the
language
covers
it.
now,
to
be
true
those
notes
indicate
that
their
talking
about
a
judgment
n.
o.
v.
entered
by
the
trial
courts
before
there
has
been
any
appeal.
but
if
you
look
at
that
language,
the
trial
court
does
not
inhibit
it
nor
should
it
be.
but
--
but
i
think
it
needs
a
clear
direction
now
from
this
court
saying
that
of
course
a
trial
court
has
to
obey
the
court
of
appeals
and
does
when
it
enters
the
judgment
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
would
think
so
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
had
the
option
to
say
new
trial
and
didn't
take
it.
and
this
is
why
we
answered
the
question,
no.
but
we
agree
that
it
should
be
that
the
final
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
new
trial,
should
be
in
that
trial
court.
i
--
i
think
they're
wrong,
carnation
says,
"well,
there's
going
to
be
some
kind
of
a
guerilla
war
there
between
the
two
of
course."
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
to
deny
appeal
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
on
the
motion
granting,
granting
a
new
trial,
the
general
rule
is,
it's
not
an
appealable
order.
is
that
what
your
honor
is
getting
at?
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
alright,
it's
not
--
it's
not
an
appealable
order.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
even
though
there's
a
decision,
determination
that
you
must
enter
judgment
n.
o.
v.
against
the
winner,
it
seems
to
me
as
the
trial
judge
ought
to
make
the
last
determination
as
to
whether
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
now,
in
making
that
determination
of
course,
he's
bound
by
the
law
enunciated
by
the
court
of
appeal
that
there's
nothing
to
indicate
except
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
passed
on.
he
probably
will
deny
the
trial,
but
in
the
final
analysis
that
judgment
ought
to
be
made
by
the
trial
court
and
not
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
there
--
there
can
be
a
lot
of
reasons
where
in
a
new
trial
you
will
have
new
evidence.
for
example,
in
the
protracted
case
like
this,
this
is
a
practical
matter
that
the
plaintiff's
counsel
may
determine
not
to
offer
all
of
his
evidence
in
the
interest
of
streamlining
the
case.
he
thinks
he
has
enough.
then
somebody
picks
a
segment
out
of
this
case
in
some
manner
which
he
couldn't
possibly
foresee.
he
ought
not
to
be
foreclosed
from
thereon
in
as
apparently
this
court
tried
to
do
in
its
direction.
so
that
he
should
be
foreclosed
and
we
believe
that
50
(c)
(2)
literally
permits
but
which
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
say
so
explicitly
before
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
believe
it.
but
that
literally
permits
the
court
to
grant
a
new
trial
even
after
entering
the
judgment
n.
o.
v.
at
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that's
of
course
the
way
it
should
be
as
a
matter
of
simple
justice,
we
ought
not
to
have
this
anomaly
where
you
worst
off
for
winning.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
i
think
that
that
--
that
i
think
that
that
rule
specifically
permits
that
he
has
to
grant
new
trial
was
to
direct
the
trial
court
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
don't
know
which
had
had
first
cracked
out
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
trial
court
as
a
practical
matter
should
have
the
last
backup.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
now,
this
is
going
to
be
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
ask
the
trial
court
for
a
new
trial
but
presumably
the
trial
court
is
going
to
deny
that
the
only
grounds
for
your
new
trial
are
those
already
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
for
example
that
in
--
in
the
example
you
are
using
suppose
after
we
get
down
the
newly
discovered
evidence
is
--
is
brought
to
light.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
i
don't
know
why
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
that's
a
little
more
difficult.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
however,
it
doesn't
work
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
but
--
but
i
don't
know
why
we
should
be
proposed
from
having
a
59
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
because
at
some
juncture,
at
some
juncture
if
you
--
if
you
win
the
trial
at
the
court
of
appeals,
still
they're
going
to
review
that
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
no,
i
think
that
generally
held
to
be
non-appealable.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
not
done,
you
won't
review
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
but
you
review
the
matter
after
the
trial
has
been
handed
if
any
injunctions
have
been
done.
and
then
you
can
reach
the
determination.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
our
view
is
that
that
does
not
preclude
the
trial
judge
from
acting
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
even
though
he's
directed
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
yes,
but
we
agree
that
it
doesn't
deny
and
in
fact
that
it
doesn't
is
pretty
coaching
evidence
that
the
last
words
should
be
held
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
question
of
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
we
agree
with
that
means.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
well,
the
appellate
court
--
well
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
it
may
order
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
i
think
the
question
is,
i
think
the
question
is
however
may
it
preclude
the
trial
court
from
acting
if
it
doesn't
order
a
new
trial.
mr.
joseph
l.
alioto
and
we
say
it
ought
not
to.
