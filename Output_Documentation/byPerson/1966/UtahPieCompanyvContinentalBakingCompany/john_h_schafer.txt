mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
thought
after
what
had
transpired
in
the
neely
case
that
we
would
not
be
discussing
the
merits
of
these
cases.
the
counsel
has
a
great
length
--
at
a
great
length
discussed
and
i
of
course
will
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
i
do
submit
to
the
court
however,
that
this
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
neely
case
and
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
get
into
this
15-volume
record
to
determine
the
questions
which
brought
this
case
to
this
court
which
were
the
procedural
questions.
in
terms
of
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
i
would
like
to
just
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
text
of
your
grant
mr.
justice
fortas
was
in
the
same
term
as
basically
in
both
cases,
the
neely
case
and
in
our
case.
the
order
which
we
receive
said
in
effect,
in
addition
they're
urging
that
the
petitioners
raise
to
discuss
these
questions.
the
court
as
i
understood
that
in
terms
of
neely
case
that
construed
that
to
mean
what
we
--
that
you
really
only
wanted
to
hear
your
argument.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
heard
some
colloquy
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
it's
not
necessary,
necessarily
necessary
to
consider
the
merits
in
order
to
consider
the
procedural
questions
that
brought
it
here.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
can
assume
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
i'm
just
saying
that
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
it.
you
don't
have
to
necessarily
have
to
get
into
this
long
record.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
white
that
as
you
have
another
area
mr.
justice
white,
in
other
cases
you
have
taken
a
case
on
simply
the
procedural
question
putting
aside
the
all
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
didn't
do
it
here.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
in
effect
you
can
say
it
seems
to
me
without
using
this
language
perhaps.
but
you
can
say
that
on
the
merits
it's
not
necessary
to
review
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
certainly
am.
i
have
very
limited
time.
i
do
want
to
say,
however,
that
we
did
oppose
producing
this
entire
record
different.
we
did
not
--i
think
it
has
to
be
printed.
the
case
against
continental
baking
company
for
whom
i
am
speaking
and
only
continental,
concerns
salt
lake
city.
in
june
of
1961,
the
continental
baking
company
was
selling
about
2%
or
1%
of
the
pies
in
salt
lake
city
market.
in
june
of
1961,
the
utah
pie
company
was
selling
about
60%
of
the
pies
in
that
market,
continental
baking
company
was
producing
selling
a
22-ounce
pie.
utah
pie
company
was
producing
and
selling
a
24-ounce
pie.
the
continental
baking
company
had
been
in
effect
excluded
from
the
salt
lake
city
market
in
prior
years
by
reason
of
inability
to
remain
price
competitive
with
the
utah
pie
company.
it
didn't
even
have
a
sales
agent
in
the
market.
in
late
october,
1960
they've
had
achieved
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
did
not
--
they
had
plant
in
watsonville.
it
started
the
plant
in
watsonville,
california.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
justice
fortas
it
did
not
get
the
watsonville
plant
in
the
operation
until
late
1960s.
and
it
was
at
that
time,
in
late
1960s
the
continental
started
trying
again
to
get
into
the
salt
lake
city
market
and
to
make
some
sales.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
they
had
a
co-packing
operation
in
california
for
a
time
in
1959.
that
was
not
economically
run.
they
abandoned
it.
for
a
time,
they
can
only
serve
the
western
markets
from
the
webster
city,
iowa
plant
or
the
crozet,
virginia
plant
and
was
only,
this
watsonville
plant
in
late
1960.
my
point
is
there
was
only
one.
they
got
this
plant
in
operation
which
was
again
the
co-packing
operation,
that
they
were
able
to
achieved
cost.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
didn't
really
mean
to
say
anything
more
than
that.
the
story
begins
in
1957.
for
awhile
even
with
these
other
plants,
continental
could
be
--
was
competitive.
the
utah
pie
company
entered
this
market
after
continental
was
in
it,
after
car
--
carnation
were
in
it.
it
started
a
price
competition
which
made
it
uneconomical,
continental
couldn't
any
longer
compete.
about
1959,
it
withdrew
in
effect
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
because
as
you
say
its
plants
did
not
permit
it
to
achieve
competitive
cost
in
salt
lake
city.
and
then
in
1960,
late
1960
it
got
this
new
plant
in
operation
and
had
achieved
this
declining
cost
picture
which
i
think
is
very
basic
to
an
understanding
what's
going
on
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
says
in
appendix
ii
of
my
brief
mr.
chief
justice.
is
at
the
record
also
at
page
5450.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
cost,
the
laid
down
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
laid
down
cost,
the
continental
in
salt
lake
city
market.
this
is
the
price
of
a
pie,
this
is
what
happens
to
the
price
--
the
cost.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
cost
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
from
any
plant.
from
the
plant
that
was
at
that
time
serving
salt
lake
city
market.
these
plants
over
this
four-year
period
are
unchanged.
there
were
three
already,
webster
city,
then
turlock,
california,
and
then
only
significant
one
in
terms
of
its
cost
was
watsonville.
i
don't
mean
--
perhaps,
i
mislead
you.
i
don't
mean
to
put
any
particular
emphasis
in
terms
of
legal
impact
on
this.
i'm
just
trying
to
describe
(voice
overlap)
what
occurred
in
june
of
1961.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
no.
i'm
just
trying
to
show
what
continental
pic
--
position
was
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
it
was
initially
one
of
being
uncompetitive
and
starting
in
october
1960,
it
became
competitive.
it
appointed
this
broker
about
which
you
heard
this
morning.
he
tried
for
seven
or
eight
months,
he
tried
to
make
some
sales,
so
that
brings
--
and
it
was
unsuccessful.
in
june
of
1961
it
was
determined
that
in
order
to
get
some
sales
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
it
was
necessary
to
quote
a
price
which
was
competitive
with
the
price
being
charged
by
the
utah
pie
company,
the
dominant
seller
in
the
market.
utah
price
--
pies
i
should
say
was
bigger,
8%
bigger
than
continental's
pies.
utah
pie
sold
its
pies
for
$3.10
a
dozen,
continental
quoted
the
price
at
$2.85
a
dozen.
that's
on
a
weight
basis.
on
an
ounce
basis
that's
the
pre-size
arithmetical
equivalent
at
this
price
which
is
offered
for
two
weeks
and
once
renewed
the
offer
was
again
renewed
for
two
weeks
in
august.
continental
sold
a
few
pies
basically
the
safeway
stores,
which
was
at
that
time
buying
only
from
pet
and
not
utah
pie,
sold
a
few
pies.
shortly
after
that
this
complaint
was
filed.
and
that's
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
utah
pie
case
against
continental
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
that's
all
of
it.
that's
in
fact
the
only
time
in
which
this
record
shows
that
continental
was
selling
at
a
higher
price
any
place
else.
he
didn't
even
bother
to
try
to
prove
discrimination
any
other
time
because
this
is
the
only
time
they
sell
it,
that
this
price
he's
complaining
about,
this
is
the
whole
lawsuit.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
a
two-week
price
discrimination
even
if
it
is
a
discrimination
which
it
isn't
when
you
compute
advertising
loses.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
he
said,
your
honor
that
the
quotation
lasted
for
two
weeks
but
safeway
bought
a
six-week
supply.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
assuming
it's
true.
as
a
legal
matter
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
law
cannot
proscribe
a
2%
seller
in
the
market
making
a
promotional
price
offer
lasting
for
two
weeks
even
if
the
effect
of
that
is
that
one
buyer
in
that
market,
one
of
about
four
major
ones,
one
buyer
buys
pie
for
six-week
supply.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
nothing.
the
price
will
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
stayed
in
the
market
quoting
an
unrealistically
high
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
is
right
after
this
$2.85
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
everybody
sir.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
basically,
bought
sir.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
one
safeway
division
which
encompasses
all
of
its
stores
into
the
salk
lake
city
market,
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
to
get
into
that
sir,
i
better
explain
to
you
that
the
way
the
competitor
works
in
this
industry
is
you
have
an
unrealistically
high
list
price
then
everybody
quotes
short-term
price
promotions
off
that
list
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
so
that
the
answer
is
yes,
it
went
back
to
the
list
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry,
it
went
back
to
the
list
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
right,
so
the
brought
it
back
automatically
because
there
was
only
a
two-week
offer.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
what
i'm
going
to
say.
utah
pie
as
soon
as
they
heard
about
continental's
$2.85price
on
a
22-ounce
pie
immediately
dropped
its
price
on
a
24-ounce
pie
to
$2.75.
this
effectively
precluded
any
further
sales
by
continental
in
the
market.
the
only
reason
safeway
bought
was
as
a
matter
of
honor.
they
already
permitted
the
sales
in
one
or
two
of
the
deals.
but
utah
pie
dropped
its
price
on
a
larger
pie
below
net
--
arithmetically
below
continental's
price.
and
that
was
the
end
of
continental
in
this
market.
it
didn't
sell
anymore
and
the
complaint
came
down
in
september.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
utah,
mr.
justice
white
never
had
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
utah
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
see
these
record
stops
in
september
1961,
almost
immediately
after
this
little
promotion
period.
and
what
--
what
goes
on
after
that
i
can't
tell
you.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
continental
made
this
two-week
offer
in
june
of
1961
to
all
buyers
in
the
market,
safeway
was
the
only
major
one
that
bought
and
safeway
at
that
time
was
buying
from
the
pet
milk
company,
not
on
any
contractual
service
but
just
buying
because
it
shows
to
buy
and
promote
those
brands.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
$2.85
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry.
our
price
was
$2.85,
his
price
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct,
on
a
22-ounce
pie.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
in
fact
you
have
for
a
full
truck
price
mr.
justice
douglas,
its
$2.85
per
lesser
quantities,
a
quarter
truck
prices
would
be
$2.89.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
if
--
when
continental
quoted
that
price
utah
pies
price
for
a
larger
pie
was
$3.10.
immediately
after
utah
--
continental
quoted
its
price,
utah
pie
price
drops
from
$3.10
down
to
$2.75.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
safeway
had
--
had
permitted
itself
to
buy
a
truckload
from
continental
at
the
time
that
safeway
heard
through
the
marketplace
that
utah
pie
had
a
lower
price.
safeway
went
to
continental
and
try
to
give
me
the
price
down
further
to
continental.
continental
said,
"no,
we
can't
do
it.
we
can't
make
any
money
with
that.
we're
not
going
to
get
any
lower
than
$2.85.
you
can
get
out
of
the
deal
if
you
want
to."
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
thrust
--
the
thrust
of
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
robinson-patman
act
in
proscribing
price
discriminations
which
may
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
does
not
proscribe
a
two-week
price
discrimination
by
a
marginal
seller
trying
to
get
some
business
entered
--
and
enter
that
market
and
to
create
competition.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
there
are
cases
on
that,
your
honor.
there
is
the
anheuser-busch
case
which
was
before
this
court
on
legal
question
and
went
back
on
a
much
longer
price
discrimination,
the
seventh
circuit
said,
no
that's
not
a
discrimination.
and
that's
not
the
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
this
court
has
never
decided
on
its
merits
in
the
area
by
discrimination
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
precisely.
and
that's
what
the
com
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i'm
not
saying
there's
so
much
meaning,
i'm
just
saying
this
kind
of
--
of
a
flurry,
a
promotional
flurry
doesn't
--
doesn't
--
is
not
proscribed
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
that's
what
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
basically
held
here.
that
on
this
limited
time
of
a
situation
you
don't
have
a
--
a
violation.
i
want
--
would
like
in
terms
of
has
this
court
have
decided
this
matter,
of
course,
the
answer
is
no,
but
the
federal
trade
commission
recently
in
the
dean
milk
case
stated
in
terms
which
i
think
are
quite
close
in
what
the
limitations
of
robinson-patman
act
have
to
be
when
--
when
applied
to
and
area
of
price
discrimination
case
because
it's
obviously,
it
only
in
--
in
this
situation,
if
the
--
if
the
act
is
applied
indiscriminately
that
you're
going
to
eliminate
price
competition
which
of
course
is
the
very
thing
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
which
respondents
are
trying
to
do.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
no,
it
didn't
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
very
definitely,
i
ask
about
the
instructions
which
were
taken
out
of
the
language
of
the
cases
which
said
in
effect
that
short
terms
sporadic
price
discriminations
are
not
un
--
are
not
unlawful.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
oh!
everyone
turned
down
in
the
trial
court,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
oh!
no.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
just
said
there's
no
evidence
here
sufficient
to
sustain
petitioner's
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
reasonably
likely
an
adverse
competitive
effect
by
reason
of
this
two-week
price
discriminations.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
under
the
law
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
2
(a)
mr.
justice
fortas
is
aimed
at
not
the
protection
of
individual
competitors.
the
cases
make
that
clear.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
appellate
courts
have
said
that.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
would
adopt
the
appellate
court's
interpretation
of
section
2
(a)
which
says
we
are
--
the
statute
is
aimed
at
protection
of
competition
genuine.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
individual
competitor
may
sink
or
swim
in
the
competitor
prices.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
you
--
you
got
to
distinguish
the
situation
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
you
got
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes
your
honor,
except
for
something
like
that
maryland
baking
case
applies.
now
there,
a
long-term
discrimination
was
applied
against
the
defendant's
only
competitor
in
that
market
with
the
effect
finally
after
four
years,
finding
that
the
effect
of
driving
that
fellow
out
of
the
business,
thereby
creating
monopoly
in
the
discriminating
sort.
now
i'm
not
trying
to
assert
you
that
that
situation
doesn't
make
out
a
2
(a)
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
no.
i
think
instead
of
a
short-term,
two-week
price
difference
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
with
--
with
the
effect,
excuse
me,
with
the
effect
of
creating
monopoly
as
a
result?
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
you're
assuming
sir
that
there
were
13
sellers
in
this
market
before
the
two-week
discrimination,
there
are
13
sellers
in
the
market,
after
this
two-week
discrimination,
yes.
i
think
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no.
well,
the
appellant
would
come
in
with
the
two
weeks,
replaces
the
one
that
went
out.
that's
my
assumption.
continental
comes
in
with
two-weeks.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it's
not
--
and
before
that
it's
not
in
the
market.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
on
--
on
a
two-week,
yes,
that
my
position
is
that.
yes.
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
--
i
mean
we're
going
far
beyond
the
case
here
because
this
competitor
flurries
during
this
time.
his
sales,
his
profits
his
--
his
payments
of
bonuses
and
salaries
to
his
offices,
everything
went
up
sharply.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
anything,
remotely
resembling
the
facts
as
raised
that
you
hypothesized.
in
--
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
appellate
court
did
that
there
was
no
evidence
here
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
reasonable
likelihood
and
adverse
competitive
effect
and
--
and
we
submit
to
you
that
this
--
in
doing
so
the
appellate
court
has
simply
fulfilled
the
usual
function
of
the
appellate
courts
in
reviewing
records
to
determine
their
legal
sufficiency.
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
this
case.
i
don't
think
frankly
that
it
belongs
here
for
that
reason,
now
the
courts
both
day
in
and
day
out
do
this
and
of
course
in
terms
of
the
expediting
act
this
court
is
precluded
in
having
the
benefit
of
that
kind
of
review
and
many
courts
and
many
justices
on
this
bench
have
said
that
we
think
it's
a
mistake.
the
appellate
courts
in
government
cases
are
--
are
not
able
to
give
us
the
benefit
of
their
--
of
their
appraisal
of
the
record.
this
is
what's
happened
here
and
i
don't
think
on
a
two-week
price
discrimination
of
the
situation
such
as
this
one
there
could
be
any
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
here,
evidence
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
substantive
core
of
the
patman
act
in
area
price
cases.
you're
always
in
this
industry.
you're
going
to
have
price
difference,
because
the
markets
are
unrelated.
but
to
say
that
a
price
difference
without
more
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
for
the
--
in
the
two-week
period
time?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
you
assume
that
advertising
allowances
are
not
price
cuts,
this
$4
of
invoice
just
show
a
price
discrimination.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
those
$4
everybody
who
bought
that
$4
pie
in
california
could
buy
50,000
dozens,
could
run
an
ad
in
a
newspaper,
one
newspaper,
the
size
of
my
thumb,
one
time
and
get
a
dollar
fifteen
off
of
it.
and
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
sure.
i
--
i'm
assuming
for
purpose
of
this
argument
mr.
justice
white
that
that
there
was
a
price
discrimination
for
two
weeks
time.
assume
that.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
yes.
assume
that
even.
but
that's
not
prima
facie
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
that's
what
the
appellate
court
held
as
i
read
their
opinion,
it
assumed
for
purposes
of
argument
that
for
two
weeks
some
place
in
the
country,
continental
baking
company
was
selling
at
higher
price
than
$2.85.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
that
was
basically
a
conspiracy
case.
he
tried
that,
he
tried
the
conspiracy
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no
we
have
to
prove
that
the
discrimination
charged
by
continental
had
certain
effects.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
a
mere
price
is
going
down
isn't
a
proof
of
that
adverse
competitive
effect.
the
important
fact
is
he
sold
more
pies
in
this
period
of
time
than
he
sold
like
before.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
a
mere
fact
that
price
is
going
down
is
usually
considered
to
be
competitive,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
--
no,
if
you're
talking
about
damage
to
him
that's
after
he
proves
a
violation
of
law
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
schafer
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
that's
true.
but
i'm
talking
about
is
--
is
a
decrease
in
price
by
itself,
evidence
of
an
adverse
competitive
effect
proscribed
by
the
statute.
and
generally
speaking,
i
think
you
have
to
say
that
at
lower
price
is
consistent
with
competition.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
it
--
it's
not
impossible
justice
white
but
in
second
--
even
in
secondary
level
cases
where
of
course
the
competitive
effect
is
much
more
likely
to
be
shown
because
one
could
--
one
competitor
who
was
buying
for
resale,
he's
buying
at
a
higher
price
than
this
competitive
right
across
the
street.
he's
going
to
be
hurt.
but
even
in
--
in
those
situations
the
appellate
courts
have
held
that
that
too
temporary,
too
sporadic
to
be
the
kind
of
adverse
competitor
effect
which
statute
is
the
same
them.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
basically,
that's
what
they
said.
well,
they
--
they
limited
their
holdings
to
those
--
the
fact
situations
in
those
cases.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
where
you're
getting
with
secondary
level
case
were
compete
--
an
injury
to
competition
almost
assumed
that
that
those
cases
are
a
fortiori
to
the
situation
here.
and
i
think
you're
going
to
have
aptly
reluctant
to
write
up
any
rule
that
says
immediately
upon
there
being
a
price
difference
between
unrelated
markets
between
bangor,
maine
and
albuquerque,
new
mexico,
that
even
though
the
albuquerque
price
drives
down
as
the
competitor's
prices
for
few
weeks,
it
seems
to
me
very
awfully
reluctant
to
say
that
that's
the
kind
of
prescription
written
in
the
--
into
the
section
2
(a),
and
then
in
your
own
decision
in
the
anheuser-busch
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
did
not
construe
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
section
2
(a)
in
an
area
case
to
proscribe
your
price
differences.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
actually,
the
kind
of
case
that
to
do
it
that
you'll
be
able
to
get
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
but
of
course
we
--
we
presented
argument,
that
was
the
heart
of
our
motion
for
directive
verdict,
it
was
the
heart
of
our
motion
for
judgment
n.
o.
v.
we
also
argued
that
the
petitioner
had
never
proved
any
impact,
even
assuming
a
violation
of
law
then
convenient
to
his
business
or
property.
and
of
course
he
hasn't,
as
a
review
of
this
record
will
show
you.
but
that
was
the
second
basic
ground
for
our
--
for
our
directive
verdict
motions
and
our
n.
o.
v.
motions.
i
see
my
time
is
practically
up.
in
terms
of
the
denver
case
which
he
also
argues
alternatively
all
you
can
do
there
is
read
the
--
read
the
charge
that
went
to
the
jury
speaking
only
of
utah,
only
of
salt
lake
city
and
quite
clearly
that
charge
do
not
tell
that
jury
to
make
any
determination
as
the
denver
facts
and
that
the
chart
is
in
the
--
is
in
the
record
and
they
will
--
they
will
explain
it
to
you
the
propriety
of
that
holding
of
law
made
by
the
appellate
court.
now
on
the
procedural
questions,
i
--
i
have
only
about
five
minutes,
both
sides
have
agree
in
their
brief
that
the
court
of
appeals
met
to
foreclose
a
new
trial.
and
we
submit
to
you
that
the
authority,
it's
clearly
there,
it's
not
in
rule
50
(d)
or
any
place
else.
it's
in
the
statute
2106,
it's
been
in
the
statute
since
1789
and
you
can
trace
it
through
as
i
have
in
my
brief.
now,
50
(d)
doesn't
add
towards
the
track
down
of
that
statute,
the
--
the
section
20
--
section
2072
of
the
u.s.
code
would
not
per
--
permit
a
rule
of
procedure
that
it
finds
on
appellate
courts
that
is
enabling
act
itself
is
limited
to
promulgation
of
rules
for
district
courts,
practices
and
procedures
in
district
courts.
one
reason
i
think
that
50
(d)
doesn't
say
and
this
appellate
court
may
deny
instead
to
do
so
is
beyond
the
scope
of
--
of
enabling
act.
now,
the
reason
that
says
that
it
may
grant,
i
think,
is
purely
permissive
language.
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
cases
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
impact
of
redmond
was
and
whether
or
not
the
appellate
courts
could
in
addition
the
granting
n.
o.
v.
and
directing
judgment
below,
if
they
also
could
grant
new
trial
and
some
of
the
cases
we've
cited
expressed
some
concern,
now
that
maybe,
i
don't
know
i
can't
tell
the
court.
definitely,
but
that
maybe
the
reason
why
50
(d)
is
written
the
way
it
is,
i
don't
know.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
of
these
other
cases,
redmond,
slocum,
hennegan,
all
endorsed
the
proposition
that
section
2106
gives
the
appellate
courts
the
authority,
gives
them
authority
to
enter
any,
physically,
any
order
that
is
just
to
require
here
any
order
that
is
just.
now,
when
the
cone
decided
the
--
the
holding
in
cone
and
in
effect
limited
2106
and
in
that
way
tended
to
--
well,
cone
said
in
certain
circumstances
the
appellate
courts
may
not
order
judgment
be
entered
below.
but
the
reason
you
had
to
say
that
was
to
protect
the
force
and
efficacy
of
--
of
the
debate.
what
you
had
to
do
was
to
prevent
an
appellant
having
a
choice
between
which
court
is
he
going
to
ask
for
new
trial.
now,
if
you
let
him
get
away
with
what
he
try
to
do
in
cone
and
in
fact
what
he
does
is
withhold
this
motion
for
judgment
n.
o.
v.
in
the
trial
court
then
present
it
to
the
appellate
court
on
a
theory
that
maybe
--
on
a
theory
that
maybe
this
court
is
must
apt
to
foreclose
a
new
trial.
now,
in
order
to
avoid
that
kind
of
forum
shopping
here
you've
got
to
hold
that
this
court,
any
appellate
court
has
the
authority
to
make
the
new
trial
decision,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
does
in
my
judgment.
it
can
review
and
reverse
grants
of
new
trials
fairmont
--
your
own
fairmont
case
makes
that
clear
and
if
you're
going
to
say
to
this
petitioner
in
effect
why
you
didn't
ask
for
a
new
trial
in
the
appellate
court
but
that
doesn't
preclude
you
from
going
back
to
the
trial
court
to
ask
for
it.
you
just
obviously
give
and
clearly
he
can
ask
the
appellate
court
first
because
that's
right
in
rule
50
(d).
and
to
say
to
him,
"well,
you
can
have
your
choice.
if
you
think
the
trial
court's
more
apt
to
give
you
a
new
trial
withhold
your
motion
from
the
appellate
court.
and
then
go
to
the
trial
court
for
it
--
with
it,"
but
that
can't
be
a
reasonable
rule
of
law.
there's
no
--
there's
no
reason
for
that.
moreover,
the
common
rationale
is
that
we're
going
to
make
you
follow
this
strictest
rule
of
50
(d)
because
if
you
do
it,
if
you
make
your
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
n.
o.
v.
in
the
trial
court,
you're
going
to
get
that
judge
to
correct
the
errors
he
may
have
made
and
you're
going
to
get
a
chance
on
a
new
trial
for
a
fresh
appraisal
of
the
witnesses
in
the
evidence,
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
but
you
don't
have
that
in
the
case
like
this
where
the
trial
judge
is
insistent
upon
entering
judgment
on
the
verdict
and
denying
a
new
trial.
you're
not
--
he
doesn't
have
any
opportunity
to
correct
his
errors.
he's
--
he's
going
to
insist
on
these
errors
if
there
were.
and
he's
got,
when
this
case
goes
back
after
a
lengthy
appeal,
two
years,
three
years,
he's
got
no
fresh
appraisal
of
--
of
the
witnesses
or
the
evidence
to
bring
to
bear
on
this
matter
or
should
have
been
a
new
trial.
he
may
not
even
be
sitting
for
all
we
know.
but
in
any
event
the
case
is
stayed
by
then.
and
there's
no
reason
that
i
can
think
of
why
we
should
be
more
interested
in
his
--
his
single
individual
exercise
of
discretion
in
this
context
than
the
exercise
of
discretion
if
you
will
by
three
judges
on
an
the
appellate
court
county.
let
the
appellee
follow
the
dictates
the
rule
50
(d),
make
the
motion
that's
required
under
that
rule.
let
the
appellate
court
while
the
case
is
overly
there.
let
it
decide,
is
there
any
ground
for
a
new
trial.
if
--
if
the
ground
were
--
i've
got
some
new
evidence,
make
them
determine
that.
this
petitioner
doesn't
say
it
has
any
new
evidence.
he
just
wants
to
go
back
and
have
ano
--
not
to
go
with
denver.
well,
if
he
made
that
motion
in
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
could
have
--
could
have
decided
that
matter
just
as
well
his
judgment
occurred
and
there's
nothing
--
we
think
there
should
be
a
flexible
rule.
we
don't
say
that
in
every
instance
the
appellate
court
need
make
it
and
foreclose
trial
court
discretion.
there
would
be
some
instances
where
it
should
be
sent
back
as
the
rule
50
(d)
makes
it
perfectly
clear.
but
there
ought
to
be
a
flexible
rule,
for
instance
in
the
area
of
--
of
judicial,
of
--
of
equity
judges
writing
decrees,
shaping
their
own
decrees,
there's
nothing
more
sink
or
swim,
that's
the
discretionary
with
them
and
yet
there
are
instances
such
as
the
el
paso
case
where
the
court,
in
that
case
this
court,
say,
we're
not
going
to
leave
divestiture,
we're
not
going
to
leave
relief
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
this
instance.
we're
going
to
order
in
this
instance,
we're
going
to
order
that
divestiture
be
accomplished.
and
that's
perfectly
proper.
it
should
be
a
flexible
rule.
we
can't
write
a
rule
that's
going
to
apply
to
all
situations,
there
should
be
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
mr.
justice
warren,
i
firmly
believe
as
i
argued
in
my
brief
that
if
the
appellate
court
was
asked
to
decide
the
merit,
it
would
hold
that
on
the
law
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
an
adverse
competitive
effect
in
the
denver
market
because
there's
nothing
shown
there
--
it's
just
a
pure
legal
question
in
other
words,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
and
they
can
make
that
decision.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
they
have
to
read
the
record
anyway
in
connection
with
their
--
with
their
whole
appellate
process.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
have
submitted
to
you
that
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
because
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into
all
of
those
facts.
but
i'm
not
saying
to
you
that
you
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
denver
facts.
you
may
do
so
of
course,
but
i
don't
it's
necessary.
you
can
affirm
the
appellate
court
in
this
situation
simply
on
it's
reading
of
the
charge
that
went
to
the
jury,
and
it's
not
necessary
for
you
to
read
these.
and
the
alternative
argument
we
made
in
the
denver
court
and
in
this
court
that
in
any
event
even
if
that
case
did
go
to
the
jury,
it
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
and
judgment
n.
o.
v.ought
to
have
be
granted
on
the
denver
market.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
none,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
thought
after
what
had
transpired
in
the
neely
case
that
we
would
not
be
discussing
the
merits
of
these
cases.
the
counsel
has
a
great
length
--
at
a
great
length
discussed
and
i
of
course
will
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
i
do
submit
to
the
court
however,
that
this
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
neely
case
and
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
get
into
this
15-volume
record
to
determine
the
questions
which
brought
this
case
to
this
court
which
were
the
procedural
questions.
in
terms
of
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
i
would
like
to
just
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
text
of
your
grant
mr.
justice
fortas
was
in
the
same
term
as
basically
in
both
cases,
the
neely
case
and
in
our
case.
the
order
which
we
receive
said
in
effect,
in
addition
they're
urging
that
the
petitioners
raise
to
discuss
these
questions.
the
court
as
i
understood
that
in
terms
of
neely
case
that
construed
that
to
mean
what
we
--
that
you
really
only
wanted
to
hear
your
argument.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
heard
some
colloquy
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
it's
not
necessary,
necessarily
necessary
to
consider
the
merits
in
order
to
consider
the
procedural
questions
that
brought
it
here.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
can
assume
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
i'm
just
saying
that
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
it.
you
don't
have
to
necessarily
have
to
get
into
this
long
record.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
white
that
as
you
have
another
area
mr.
justice
white,
in
other
cases
you
have
taken
a
case
on
simply
the
procedural
question
putting
aside
the
all
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
didn't
do
it
here.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
in
effect
you
can
say
it
seems
to
me
without
using
this
language
perhaps.
but
you
can
say
that
on
the
merits
it's
not
necessary
to
review
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
certainly
am.
i
have
very
limited
time.
i
do
want
to
say,
however,
that
we
did
oppose
producing
this
entire
record
different.
we
did
not
--i
think
it
has
to
be
printed.
the
case
against
continental
baking
company
for
whom
i
am
speaking
and
only
continental,
concerns
salt
lake
city.
in
june
of
1961,
the
continental
baking
company
was
selling
about
2%
or
1%
of
the
pies
in
salt
lake
city
market.
in
june
of
1961,
the
utah
pie
company
was
selling
about
60%
of
the
pies
in
that
market,
continental
baking
company
was
producing
selling
a
22-ounce
pie.
utah
pie
company
was
producing
and
selling
a
24-ounce
pie.
the
continental
baking
company
had
been
in
effect
excluded
from
the
salt
lake
city
market
in
prior
years
by
reason
of
inability
to
remain
price
competitive
with
the
utah
pie
company.
it
didn't
even
have
a
sales
agent
in
the
market.
in
late
october,
1960
they've
had
achieved
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
did
not
--
they
had
plant
in
watsonville.
it
started
the
plant
in
watsonville,
california.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
justice
fortas
it
did
not
get
the
watsonville
plant
in
the
operation
until
late
1960s.
and
it
was
at
that
time,
in
late
1960s
the
continental
started
trying
again
to
get
into
the
salt
lake
city
market
and
to
make
some
sales.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
they
had
a
co-packing
operation
in
california
for
a
time
in
1959.
that
was
not
economically
run.
they
abandoned
it.
for
a
time,
they
can
only
serve
the
western
markets
from
the
webster
city,
iowa
plant
or
the
crozet,
virginia
plant
and
was
only,
this
watsonville
plant
in
late
1960.
my
point
is
there
was
only
one.
they
got
this
plant
in
operation
which
was
again
the
co-packing
operation,
that
they
were
able
to
achieved
cost.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
didn't
really
mean
to
say
anything
more
than
that.
the
story
begins
in
1957.
for
awhile
even
with
these
other
plants,
continental
could
be
--
was
competitive.
the
utah
pie
company
entered
this
market
after
continental
was
in
it,
after
car
--
carnation
were
in
it.
it
started
a
price
competition
which
made
it
uneconomical,
continental
couldn't
any
longer
compete.
about
1959,
it
withdrew
in
effect
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
because
as
you
say
its
plants
did
not
permit
it
to
achieve
competitive
cost
in
salt
lake
city.
and
then
in
1960,
late
1960
it
got
this
new
plant
in
operation
and
had
achieved
this
declining
cost
picture
which
i
think
is
very
basic
to
an
understanding
what's
going
on
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
says
in
appendix
ii
of
my
brief
mr.
chief
justice.
is
at
the
record
also
at
page
5450.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
cost,
the
laid
down
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
laid
down
cost,
the
continental
in
salt
lake
city
market.
this
is
the
price
of
a
pie,
this
is
what
happens
to
the
price
--
the
cost.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
cost
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
from
any
plant.
from
the
plant
that
was
at
that
time
serving
salt
lake
city
market.
these
plants
over
this
four-year
period
are
unchanged.
there
were
three
already,
webster
city,
then
turlock,
california,
and
then
only
significant
one
in
terms
of
its
cost
was
watsonville.
i
don't
mean
--
perhaps,
i
mislead
you.
i
don't
mean
to
put
any
particular
emphasis
in
terms
of
legal
impact
on
this.
i'm
just
trying
to
describe
(voice
overlap)
what
occurred
in
june
of
1961.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
no.
i'm
just
trying
to
show
what
continental
pic
--
position
was
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
it
was
initially
one
of
being
uncompetitive
and
starting
in
october
1960,
it
became
competitive.
it
appointed
this
broker
about
which
you
heard
this
morning.
he
tried
for
seven
or
eight
months,
he
tried
to
make
some
sales,
so
that
brings
--
and
it
was
unsuccessful.
in
june
of
1961
it
was
determined
that
in
order
to
get
some
sales
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
it
was
necessary
to
quote
a
price
which
was
competitive
with
the
price
being
charged
by
the
utah
pie
company,
the
dominant
seller
in
the
market.
utah
price
--
pies
i
should
say
was
bigger,
8%
bigger
than
continental's
pies.
utah
pie
sold
its
pies
for
$3.10
a
dozen,
continental
quoted
the
price
at
$2.85
a
dozen.
that's
on
a
weight
basis.
on
an
ounce
basis
that's
the
pre-size
arithmetical
equivalent
at
this
price
which
is
offered
for
two
weeks
and
once
renewed
the
offer
was
again
renewed
for
two
weeks
in
august.
continental
sold
a
few
pies
basically
the
safeway
stores,
which
was
at
that
time
buying
only
from
pet
and
not
utah
pie,
sold
a
few
pies.
shortly
after
that
this
complaint
was
filed.
and
that's
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
utah
pie
case
against
continental
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
that's
all
of
it.
that's
in
fact
the
only
time
in
which
this
record
shows
that
continental
was
selling
at
a
higher
price
any
place
else.
he
didn't
even
bother
to
try
to
prove
discrimination
any
other
time
because
this
is
the
only
time
they
sell
it,
that
this
price
he's
complaining
about,
this
is
the
whole
lawsuit.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
a
two-week
price
discrimination
even
if
it
is
a
discrimination
which
it
isn't
when
you
compute
advertising
loses.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
he
said,
your
honor
that
the
quotation
lasted
for
two
weeks
but
safeway
bought
a
six-week
supply.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
assuming
it's
true.
as
a
legal
matter
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
law
cannot
proscribe
a
2%
seller
in
the
market
making
a
promotional
price
offer
lasting
for
two
weeks
even
if
the
effect
of
that
is
that
one
buyer
in
that
market,
one
of
about
four
major
ones,
one
buyer
buys
pie
for
six-week
supply.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
nothing.
the
price
will
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
stayed
in
the
market
quoting
an
unrealistically
high
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
is
right
after
this
$2.85
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
everybody
sir.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
basically,
bought
sir.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
one
safeway
division
which
encompasses
all
of
its
stores
into
the
salk
lake
city
market,
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
to
get
into
that
sir,
i
better
explain
to
you
that
the
way
the
competitor
works
in
this
industry
is
you
have
an
unrealistically
high
list
price
then
everybody
quotes
short-term
price
promotions
off
that
list
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
so
that
the
answer
is
yes,
it
went
back
to
the
list
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry,
it
went
back
to
the
list
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
right,
so
the
brought
it
back
automatically
because
there
was
only
a
two-week
offer.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
what
i'm
going
to
say.
utah
pie
as
soon
as
they
heard
about
continental's
$2.85price
on
a
22-ounce
pie
immediately
dropped
its
price
on
a
24-ounce
pie
to
$2.75.
this
effectively
precluded
any
further
sales
by
continental
in
the
market.
the
only
reason
safeway
bought
was
as
a
matter
of
honor.
they
already
permitted
the
sales
in
one
or
two
of
the
deals.
but
utah
pie
dropped
its
price
on
a
larger
pie
below
net
--
arithmetically
below
continental's
price.
and
that
was
the
end
of
continental
in
this
market.
it
didn't
sell
anymore
and
the
complaint
came
down
in
september.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
utah,
mr.
justice
white
never
had
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
utah
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
see
these
record
stops
in
september
1961,
almost
immediately
after
this
little
promotion
period.
and
what
--
what
goes
on
after
that
i
can't
tell
you.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
continental
made
this
two-week
offer
in
june
of
1961
to
all
buyers
in
the
market,
safeway
was
the
only
major
one
that
bought
and
safeway
at
that
time
was
buying
from
the
pet
milk
company,
not
on
any
contractual
service
but
just
buying
because
it
shows
to
buy
and
promote
those
brands.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
$2.85
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry.
our
price
was
$2.85,
his
price
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct,
on
a
22-ounce
pie.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
in
fact
you
have
for
a
full
truck
price
mr.
justice
douglas,
its
$2.85
per
lesser
quantities,
a
quarter
truck
prices
would
be
$2.89.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
if
--
when
continental
quoted
that
price
utah
pies
price
for
a
larger
pie
was
$3.10.
immediately
after
utah
--
continental
quoted
its
price,
utah
pie
price
drops
from
$3.10
down
to
$2.75.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
safeway
had
--
had
permitted
itself
to
buy
a
truckload
from
continental
at
the
time
that
safeway
heard
through
the
marketplace
that
utah
pie
had
a
lower
price.
safeway
went
to
continental
and
try
to
give
me
the
price
down
further
to
continental.
continental
said,
"no,
we
can't
do
it.
we
can't
make
any
money
with
that.
we're
not
going
to
get
any
lower
than
$2.85.
you
can
get
out
of
the
deal
if
you
want
to."
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
thrust
--
the
thrust
of
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
robinson-patman
act
in
proscribing
price
discriminations
which
may
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
does
not
proscribe
a
two-week
price
discrimination
by
a
marginal
seller
trying
to
get
some
business
entered
--
and
enter
that
market
and
to
create
competition.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
there
are
cases
on
that,
your
honor.
there
is
the
anheuser-busch
case
which
was
before
this
court
on
legal
question
and
went
back
on
a
much
longer
price
discrimination,
the
seventh
circuit
said,
no
that's
not
a
discrimination.
and
that's
not
the
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
this
court
has
never
decided
on
its
merits
in
the
area
by
discrimination
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
precisely.
and
that's
what
the
com
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i'm
not
saying
there's
so
much
meaning,
i'm
just
saying
this
kind
of
--
of
a
flurry,
a
promotional
flurry
doesn't
--
doesn't
--
is
not
proscribed
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
that's
what
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
basically
held
here.
that
on
this
limited
time
of
a
situation
you
don't
have
a
--
a
violation.
i
want
--
would
like
in
terms
of
has
this
court
have
decided
this
matter,
of
course,
the
answer
is
no,
but
the
federal
trade
commission
recently
in
the
dean
milk
case
stated
in
terms
which
i
think
are
quite
close
in
what
the
limitations
of
robinson-patman
act
have
to
be
when
--
when
applied
to
and
area
of
price
discrimination
case
because
it's
obviously,
it
only
in
--
in
this
situation,
if
the
--
if
the
act
is
applied
indiscriminately
that
you're
going
to
eliminate
price
competition
which
of
course
is
the
very
thing
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
which
respondents
are
trying
to
do.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
no,
it
didn't
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
very
definitely,
i
ask
about
the
instructions
which
were
taken
out
of
the
language
of
the
cases
which
said
in
effect
that
short
terms
sporadic
price
discriminations
are
not
un
--
are
not
unlawful.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
oh!
everyone
turned
down
in
the
trial
court,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
oh!
no.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
just
said
there's
no
evidence
here
sufficient
to
sustain
petitioner's
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
reasonably
likely
an
adverse
competitive
effect
by
reason
of
this
two-week
price
discriminations.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
under
the
law
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
2
(a)
mr.
justice
fortas
is
aimed
at
not
the
protection
of
individual
competitors.
the
cases
make
that
clear.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
appellate
courts
have
said
that.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
would
adopt
the
appellate
court's
interpretation
of
section
2
(a)
which
says
we
are
--
the
statute
is
aimed
at
protection
of
competition
genuine.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
individual
competitor
may
sink
or
swim
in
the
competitor
prices.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
you
--
you
got
to
distinguish
the
situation
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
you
got
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes
your
honor,
except
for
something
like
that
maryland
baking
case
applies.
now
there,
a
long-term
discrimination
was
applied
against
the
defendant's
only
competitor
in
that
market
with
the
effect
finally
after
four
years,
finding
that
the
effect
of
driving
that
fellow
out
of
the
business,
thereby
creating
monopoly
in
the
discriminating
sort.
now
i'm
not
trying
to
assert
you
that
that
situation
doesn't
make
out
a
2
(a)
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
no.
i
think
instead
of
a
short-term,
two-week
price
difference
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
with
--
with
the
effect,
excuse
me,
with
the
effect
of
creating
monopoly
as
a
result?
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
you're
assuming
sir
that
there
were
13
sellers
in
this
market
before
the
two-week
discrimination,
there
are
13
sellers
in
the
market,
after
this
two-week
discrimination,
yes.
i
think
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no.
well,
the
appellant
would
come
in
with
the
two
weeks,
replaces
the
one
that
went
out.
that's
my
assumption.
continental
comes
in
with
two-weeks.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it's
not
--
and
before
that
it's
not
in
the
market.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
on
--
on
a
two-week,
yes,
that
my
position
is
that.
yes.
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
--
i
mean
we're
going
far
beyond
the
case
here
because
this
competitor
flurries
during
this
time.
his
sales,
his
profits
his
--
his
payments
of
bonuses
and
salaries
to
his
offices,
everything
went
up
sharply.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
anything,
remotely
resembling
the
facts
as
raised
that
you
hypothesized.
in
--
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
appellate
court
did
that
there
was
no
evidence
here
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
reasonable
likelihood
and
adverse
competitive
effect
and
--
and
we
submit
to
you
that
this
--
in
doing
so
the
appellate
court
has
simply
fulfilled
the
usual
function
of
the
appellate
courts
in
reviewing
records
to
determine
their
legal
sufficiency.
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
this
case.
i
don't
think
frankly
that
it
belongs
here
for
that
reason,
now
the
courts
both
day
in
and
day
out
do
this
and
of
course
in
terms
of
the
expediting
act
this
court
is
precluded
in
having
the
benefit
of
that
kind
of
review
and
many
courts
and
many
justices
on
this
bench
have
said
that
we
think
it's
a
mistake.
the
appellate
courts
in
government
cases
are
--
are
not
able
to
give
us
the
benefit
of
their
--
of
their
appraisal
of
the
record.
this
is
what's
happened
here
and
i
don't
think
on
a
two-week
price
discrimination
of
the
situation
such
as
this
one
there
could
be
any
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
here,
evidence
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
substantive
core
of
the
patman
act
in
area
price
cases.
you're
always
in
this
industry.
you're
going
to
have
price
difference,
because
the
markets
are
unrelated.
but
to
say
that
a
price
difference
without
more
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
for
the
--
in
the
two-week
period
time?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
you
assume
that
advertising
allowances
are
not
price
cuts,
this
$4
of
invoice
just
show
a
price
discrimination.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
those
$4
everybody
who
bought
that
$4
pie
in
california
could
buy
50,000
dozens,
could
run
an
ad
in
a
newspaper,
one
newspaper,
the
size
of
my
thumb,
one
time
and
get
a
dollar
fifteen
off
of
it.
and
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
sure.
i
--
i'm
assuming
for
purpose
of
this
argument
mr.
justice
white
that
that
there
was
a
price
discrimination
for
two
weeks
time.
assume
that.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
yes.
assume
that
even.
but
that's
not
prima
facie
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
that's
what
the
appellate
court
held
as
i
read
their
opinion,
it
assumed
for
purposes
of
argument
that
for
two
weeks
some
place
in
the
country,
continental
baking
company
was
selling
at
higher
price
than
$2.85.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
that
was
basically
a
conspiracy
case.
he
tried
that,
he
tried
the
conspiracy
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no
we
have
to
prove
that
the
discrimination
charged
by
continental
had
certain
effects.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
a
mere
price
is
going
down
isn't
a
proof
of
that
adverse
competitive
effect.
the
important
fact
is
he
sold
more
pies
in
this
period
of
time
than
he
sold
like
before.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
a
mere
fact
that
price
is
going
down
is
usually
considered
to
be
competitive,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
--
no,
if
you're
talking
about
damage
to
him
that's
after
he
proves
a
violation
of
law
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
schafer
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
that's
true.
but
i'm
talking
about
is
--
is
a
decrease
in
price
by
itself,
evidence
of
an
adverse
competitive
effect
proscribed
by
the
statute.
and
generally
speaking,
i
think
you
have
to
say
that
at
lower
price
is
consistent
with
competition.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
it
--
it's
not
impossible
justice
white
but
in
second
--
even
in
secondary
level
cases
where
of
course
the
competitive
effect
is
much
more
likely
to
be
shown
because
one
could
--
one
competitor
who
was
buying
for
resale,
he's
buying
at
a
higher
price
than
this
competitive
right
across
the
street.
he's
going
to
be
hurt.
but
even
in
--
in
those
situations
the
appellate
courts
have
held
that
that
too
temporary,
too
sporadic
to
be
the
kind
of
adverse
competitor
effect
which
statute
is
the
same
them.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
basically,
that's
what
they
said.
well,
they
--
they
limited
their
holdings
to
those
--
the
fact
situations
in
those
cases.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
where
you're
getting
with
secondary
level
case
were
compete
--
an
injury
to
competition
almost
assumed
that
that
those
cases
are
a
fortiori
to
the
situation
here.
and
i
think
you're
going
to
have
aptly
reluctant
to
write
up
any
rule
that
says
immediately
upon
there
being
a
price
difference
between
unrelated
markets
between
bangor,
maine
and
albuquerque,
new
mexico,
that
even
though
the
albuquerque
price
drives
down
as
the
competitor's
prices
for
few
weeks,
it
seems
to
me
very
awfully
reluctant
to
say
that
that's
the
kind
of
prescription
written
in
the
--
into
the
section
2
(a),
and
then
in
your
own
decision
in
the
anheuser-busch
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
did
not
construe
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
section
2
(a)
in
an
area
case
to
proscribe
your
price
differences.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
actually,
the
kind
of
case
that
to
do
it
that
you'll
be
able
to
get
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
but
of
course
we
--
we
presented
argument,
that
was
the
heart
of
our
motion
for
directive
verdict,
it
was
the
heart
of
our
motion
for
judgment
n.
o.
v.
we
also
argued
that
the
petitioner
had
never
proved
any
impact,
even
assuming
a
violation
of
law
then
convenient
to
his
business
or
property.
and
of
course
he
hasn't,
as
a
review
of
this
record
will
show
you.
but
that
was
the
second
basic
ground
for
our
--
for
our
directive
verdict
motions
and
our
n.
o.
v.
motions.
i
see
my
time
is
practically
up.
in
terms
of
the
denver
case
which
he
also
argues
alternatively
all
you
can
do
there
is
read
the
--
read
the
charge
that
went
to
the
jury
speaking
only
of
utah,
only
of
salt
lake
city
and
quite
clearly
that
charge
do
not
tell
that
jury
to
make
any
determination
as
the
denver
facts
and
that
the
chart
is
in
the
--
is
in
the
record
and
they
will
--
they
will
explain
it
to
you
the
propriety
of
that
holding
of
law
made
by
the
appellate
court.
now
on
the
procedural
questions,
i
--
i
have
only
about
five
minutes,
both
sides
have
agree
in
their
brief
that
the
court
of
appeals
met
to
foreclose
a
new
trial.
and
we
submit
to
you
that
the
authority,
it's
clearly
there,
it's
not
in
rule
50
(d)
or
any
place
else.
it's
in
the
statute
2106,
it's
been
in
the
statute
since
1789
and
you
can
trace
it
through
as
i
have
in
my
brief.
now,
50
(d)
doesn't
add
towards
the
track
down
of
that
statute,
the
--
the
section
20
--
section
2072
of
the
u.s.
code
would
not
per
--
permit
a
rule
of
procedure
that
it
finds
on
appellate
courts
that
is
enabling
act
itself
is
limited
to
promulgation
of
rules
for
district
courts,
practices
and
procedures
in
district
courts.
one
reason
i
think
that
50
(d)
doesn't
say
and
this
appellate
court
may
deny
instead
to
do
so
is
beyond
the
scope
of
--
of
enabling
act.
now,
the
reason
that
says
that
it
may
grant,
i
think,
is
purely
permissive
language.
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
cases
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
impact
of
redmond
was
and
whether
or
not
the
appellate
courts
could
in
addition
the
granting
n.
o.
v.
and
directing
judgment
below,
if
they
also
could
grant
new
trial
and
some
of
the
cases
we've
cited
expressed
some
concern,
now
that
maybe,
i
don't
know
i
can't
tell
the
court.
definitely,
but
that
maybe
the
reason
why
50
(d)
is
written
the
way
it
is,
i
don't
know.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
of
these
other
cases,
redmond,
slocum,
hennegan,
all
endorsed
the
proposition
that
section
2106
gives
the
appellate
courts
the
authority,
gives
them
authority
to
enter
any,
physically,
any
order
that
is
just
to
require
here
any
order
that
is
just.
now,
when
the
cone
decided
the
--
the
holding
in
cone
and
in
effect
limited
2106
and
in
that
way
tended
to
--
well,
cone
said
in
certain
circumstances
the
appellate
courts
may
not
order
judgment
be
entered
below.
but
the
reason
you
had
to
say
that
was
to
protect
the
force
and
efficacy
of
--
of
the
debate.
what
you
had
to
do
was
to
prevent
an
appellant
having
a
choice
between
which
court
is
he
going
to
ask
for
new
trial.
now,
if
you
let
him
get
away
with
what
he
try
to
do
in
cone
and
in
fact
what
he
does
is
withhold
this
motion
for
judgment
n.
o.
v.
in
the
trial
court
then
present
it
to
the
appellate
court
on
a
theory
that
maybe
--
on
a
theory
that
maybe
this
court
is
must
apt
to
foreclose
a
new
trial.
now,
in
order
to
avoid
that
kind
of
forum
shopping
here
you've
got
to
hold
that
this
court,
any
appellate
court
has
the
authority
to
make
the
new
trial
decision,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
does
in
my
judgment.
it
can
review
and
reverse
grants
of
new
trials
fairmont
--
your
own
fairmont
case
makes
that
clear
and
if
you're
going
to
say
to
this
petitioner
in
effect
why
you
didn't
ask
for
a
new
trial
in
the
appellate
court
but
that
doesn't
preclude
you
from
going
back
to
the
trial
court
to
ask
for
it.
you
just
obviously
give
and
clearly
he
can
ask
the
appellate
court
first
because
that's
right
in
rule
50
(d).
and
to
say
to
him,
"well,
you
can
have
your
choice.
if
you
think
the
trial
court's
more
apt
to
give
you
a
new
trial
withhold
your
motion
from
the
appellate
court.
and
then
go
to
the
trial
court
for
it
--
with
it,"
but
that
can't
be
a
reasonable
rule
of
law.
there's
no
--
there's
no
reason
for
that.
moreover,
the
common
rationale
is
that
we're
going
to
make
you
follow
this
strictest
rule
of
50
(d)
because
if
you
do
it,
if
you
make
your
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
n.
o.
v.
in
the
trial
court,
you're
going
to
get
that
judge
to
correct
the
errors
he
may
have
made
and
you're
going
to
get
a
chance
on
a
new
trial
for
a
fresh
appraisal
of
the
witnesses
in
the
evidence,
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
new
trial.
but
you
don't
have
that
in
the
case
like
this
where
the
trial
judge
is
insistent
upon
entering
judgment
on
the
verdict
and
denying
a
new
trial.
you're
not
--
he
doesn't
have
any
opportunity
to
correct
his
errors.
he's
--
he's
going
to
insist
on
these
errors
if
there
were.
and
he's
got,
when
this
case
goes
back
after
a
lengthy
appeal,
two
years,
three
years,
he's
got
no
fresh
appraisal
of
--
of
the
witnesses
or
the
evidence
to
bring
to
bear
on
this
matter
or
should
have
been
a
new
trial.
he
may
not
even
be
sitting
for
all
we
know.
but
in
any
event
the
case
is
stayed
by
then.
and
there's
no
reason
that
i
can
think
of
why
we
should
be
more
interested
in
his
--
his
single
individual
exercise
of
discretion
in
this
context
than
the
exercise
of
discretion
if
you
will
by
three
judges
on
an
the
appellate
court
county.
let
the
appellee
follow
the
dictates
the
rule
50
(d),
make
the
motion
that's
required
under
that
rule.
let
the
appellate
court
while
the
case
is
overly
there.
let
it
decide,
is
there
any
ground
for
a
new
trial.
if
--
if
the
ground
were
--
i've
got
some
new
evidence,
make
them
determine
that.
this
petitioner
doesn't
say
it
has
any
new
evidence.
he
just
wants
to
go
back
and
have
ano
--
not
to
go
with
denver.
well,
if
he
made
that
motion
in
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
could
have
--
could
have
decided
that
matter
just
as
well
his
judgment
occurred
and
there's
nothing
--
we
think
there
should
be
a
flexible
rule.
we
don't
say
that
in
every
instance
the
appellate
court
need
make
it
and
foreclose
trial
court
discretion.
there
would
be
some
instances
where
it
should
be
sent
back
as
the
rule
50
(d)
makes
it
perfectly
clear.
but
there
ought
to
be
a
flexible
rule,
for
instance
in
the
area
of
--
of
judicial,
of
--
of
equity
judges
writing
decrees,
shaping
their
own
decrees,
there's
nothing
more
sink
or
swim,
that's
the
discretionary
with
them
and
yet
there
are
instances
such
as
the
el
paso
case
where
the
court,
in
that
case
this
court,
say,
we're
not
going
to
leave
divestiture,
we're
not
going
to
leave
relief
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
this
instance.
we're
going
to
order
in
this
instance,
we're
going
to
order
that
divestiture
be
accomplished.
and
that's
perfectly
proper.
it
should
be
a
flexible
rule.
we
can't
write
a
rule
that's
going
to
apply
to
all
situations,
there
should
be

mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
mr.
justice
warren,
i
firmly
believe
as
i
argued
in
my
brief
that
if
the
appellate
court
was
asked
to
decide
the
merit,
it
would
hold
that
on
the
law
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
an
adverse
competitive
effect
in
the
denver
market
because
there's
nothing
shown
there
--
it's
just
a
pure
legal
question
in
other
words,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
and
they
can
make
that
decision.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
they
have
to
read
the
record
anyway
in
connection
with
their
--
with
their
whole
appellate
process.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
have
submitted
to
you
that
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
because
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into
all
of
those
facts.
but
i'm
not
saying
to
you
that
you
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
denver
facts.
you
may
do
so
of
course,
but
i
don't
it's
necessary.
you
can
affirm
the
appellate
court
in
this
situation
simply
on
it's
reading
of
the
charge
that
went
to
the
jury,
and
it's
not
necessary
for
you
to
read
these.
and
the
alternative
argument
we
made
in
the
denver
court
and
in
this
court
that
in
any
event
even
if
that
case
did
go
to
the
jury,
it
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
and
judgment
n.
o.
v.ought
to
have
be
granted
on
the
denver
market.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
none,
your
honor.
