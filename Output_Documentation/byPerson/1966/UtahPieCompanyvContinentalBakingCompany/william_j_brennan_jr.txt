justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
though,
does
that
have
to
be
determined
as
each
individual
defendant
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
in
other
words
--
and
in
other
words,
if
you
are
right
that
the
court
of
the
appeals
were
wrong,
it
would
require
us
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
each
individual
case
which
may
mean
they
might
conclude
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
as
to
one,
but
wrong
as
to
two.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
was
fair
to
try
this
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
a
--
then
a
record
desires
this
table
in
this
picture.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
to
read
all
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
curious,
why
was
it
necessary
to
go
to
the
expense
of
cleaning
such
an
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
issues
for
us
don't
require
us
to
examine
all
that
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
i
--
if
understand
you
correctly,
it's
because
the
issue
with
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
that
the
appellant
should
felt
that
you
could
not
risk,
not
putting
the
entire
record
even
though
you
think
yourself
and
the
appellate
court
doesn't
have
to
examine
the
entire
record
to
pass
on
the
issues.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
that
says
that
that
should
be
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
why
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
once
you
got
them
in
why,
why
couldn't
the
original
invoices
have
been
just
filed
here
or
below
without
putting
in
or
having
it
more
reproduced.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
prepared
40
copies
of
these
damages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
carried
and
applied
to
the
court
for
permission
to
do
it,
without
trying
to
overcome
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
frankly
i
am
concerned
with
the
expense
of
the
litigation
are
just
getting
out
of
hand
anyway.
and
when
we
get
the
record
as
high
as
this
table
as
we
do
in
this
case,
when
you
tell
us
that
really
we
don't
have
to
consult
it
i
just
think
there's
something
wrong
about
our
rules
or
something
that
they
should
do
that
for
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
the
plant's
fast
break
was
that
--
that
was
the
identi
?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gat
--
i
gathered
on
for
example,
pet,
was
california
one
zone
and
salt
lake
was
another
zone
for
pet
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
suppose
midwest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
was
no
uniform
--
no
uniform
price
then
among
zones,
was
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
such
as
that
denver
was
out
of
the
case
we're
in
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
such
as
that
denver
is
out
of
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
a
rule
65
to
know
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree
but
you
would
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
would
have
at
least.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aren't
you
really
saying
that
you
think
that
the
last
word
on
the
disposition
of
the
case
should
be
less
than
the
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
is
it
then
if
under
the
rule
that
the
appellate
court
may
say
and
you
must
allow
a
new
trial.
how
does
that
give
you
the
trial
court
the
last
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
rule
the
appellate
court
may
say,
may
it
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
language
of
the
rule
and
by
way
reverse,
there
shall
be
a
new
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
goes
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
suggest
that
justice
black's
question
requires
an
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
you
get
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not
--
i
thought
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
--
that
the
issue
of
the
merits
was
not
before
us
under
our
grants.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
are
the
carnation
products?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.

william
j.

may
