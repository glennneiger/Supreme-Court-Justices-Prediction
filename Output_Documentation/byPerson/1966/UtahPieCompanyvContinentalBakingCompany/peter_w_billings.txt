mr.
peter
w.
billings
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
carnation
company,
the
second
of
the
three
individual
defendants
against
whom
these
individual
robinson-patman
act
charges
were
brought.
my
task
this
afternoon
is
to
outline
the
different
facts
with
respect
to
carnation
as
compared
with
the
facts
as
to
the
other
two.
i'm
starting
out
by
saying
a
particular
answer
to
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
this
court
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
several
feed
of
record
here
with
so
far
as
carnation
is
concern.
i
understand
mr.
alioto's
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
that
data
doesn't
particularly
question
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
of
the
facts
as
to
sales,
prices,
volume,
profit,
market
share,
the
key
issues
in
this
case
so
far
as
carnation's
concern,
so
that
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no
sir,
i
do
not.
and
i
think
that
so
far
as
carnation
and
the
kicker
with
respect
to
carnation,
this
court
need
look
no
further.
mr.
alioto
took
exception
with
two
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals
statements,
one
having
to
do
with
bel-air
which
doesn't
concern
carnation.
the
other
had
to
do
with
the
denver
market
which
does
not
concern
carnation.
i
think
all
this
court
need
look
at
is
the
statement
of
facts
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
volume
15
of
the
record.
so
that
--
so
far
it's
concern,
the
task
is
relatively
simple.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
was
correct
in
its
disposition
of
the
case
so
far
as
carnation
is
concerned.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
didn't
mean
to
skip
that
over
rapidly,
your
honor.
what
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
as
i
understand
that
both
petitioner
here
and
the
respondent
carnation
agree
that
the
facts
of
the
evidence
as
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
carnation
is
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that
is
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
oh!
i'm
sure
your
honor
that
if
the
counsel
for
petitioner
thought
that
there
were
some
facts
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
overlooked,
he
have
been
quick
to
point
them
out.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
but
not
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
true
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
those
do
not
concern
carnation
and
that
my
task
here
this
afternoon
is
to
point
out
to
you
why?
that
the
points
which
concern
carnation,
i.e.
the
--
the
prices
of
which
these
frozen
pies
were
sold,
the
volume
which
were
sold
by
each
of
the
parties.
the
profits
which
were
made,
the
market
share
which
was
gain
by
each
of
the
parties
are
not
questioned.
the
evidence
if
in
effect
was
stipulated,
both
parties
introduced
the
market
share
study
for
example.
and
what
i
want
to
do
now,
if
i
may,
would
be
to
turn
to
what
those
facts
on.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
would
say
this
your
honor
that
so
far
as
--
as
the
carnation's
concern
that
reading
any
further
in
this
record
with
respect
to
it
would
not
aid
the
court
in
--
in
determining
that
particular
issue.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
alright,
now
if
i
may,
i'll
turn
then
to
the
facts
with
respect
to
carnation
on
this
key
--
key
argument.
and
i
think
perhaps
maybe
the
best
way
to
do
it
might
be
with
respect
to
taking
it
on
a
year-by-year
basis.
carnation
entered
this
business
in
1955.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
simple
simon,
the
red
line.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
and
it
had
been
in
the
utah
market
since
1955.
in
19
--
late
1957,
early
1958,
the
petitioner
utah
pie
company
entered
the
market
at
this
level
substantially
below
the
level
in
which
carnation
was
selling
its
pies.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
fresh
pie.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
not
the
frozen
pie,
just
the
fresh
pie
market,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
selling
in
grocery
stores
and
so
on.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct.
the
--
the
record
shows
that
they
were
losing
substantial
sums
of
money
in
their
fresh
pie
business
and
that
probably
it
was
one
of
the
motivating
factors
which
why
they
went
in.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
they
came
in
and
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
might
say
why
we're
talking
about
that.
that's
our
position
and
this
is
the
only
relevant
market
concerned
here,
that
of
the
petitioner
sales
there
were
only,
there
was
one
costumer
in
spokane,
washington
as
to
which
it
--
the
--
the
utah
pie
company
sold
f.
o.
b.
in
salt
lake
city
on
a
special
label
basis,
the
sonny
boy
label.
the
other
--
only
other
customer
it
had
of
any
size
or
toll
or
any
volume
outside
of
this
--
in
salt
lake
area
with
which
it
should
be
utah
and
southern
idaho
where
--
where
one
period
in
1959
when
it
sold
some
substantial
sales
of
pumpkin
and
mince.
i
didn't
have
the
record
that
shows
that
about
98%
of
all
their
sales
were
in
the
submitted
area
and
that's
the
area
i'm
talking
about,
that's
what
the
chart
for
example
refers
to,
that's
what
the
market
share
study
refers
to
and
so
on.
as
a
result
of
coming
in
at
this
level,
utah
pie
captured
66%
of
the
market
in
the
salt
lake
area
that
first
year.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
--
it's
like
--
this
is
indulged
in
the
case.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
a
little
about
$2
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
there
are
six
pies
to
a
case.
so
that
two
cases
to
a
dozen
in
effect.
and
that
could
show
the
only,
the
first
prize
cut
being
made
was
right
here
in
1958
and
at
this
time
our
prices
were
way
up
here.
at
that
time
our
prices
were
the
same
in
salt
lake
as
in
san
francisco
and
the
los
angeles.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
los
angeles.
we
only
have
one
plant
your
honor,
in
los
angeles.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
now,
with
respect
to
discrimination
which
is
half
of
the
elements
of
a
violation
statute,
i
think
the
most
illustrative
aspect
of
what
carnation
was
doing,
it's
contained
them
the
exhibits
which
are
in
pages
57,
68
and
so
on
in
volume
50
and
on
bond
50
in
this
record,
and
as
i
have
the
one
here
for
southern
california
and
this
is
the
relationship
chart.
the
red
line
b
whether
the
price
in
another
market
this
one,
northern
california
was
higher
or
lower
than
the
mar
--
than
the
price
in
salt
lake
city
which
is
the
center.
it
doesn't
mean
that
salt
lake
city
price
was
constant,
it
was
varied.
but
the
--
the
relationship
was
varied.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
carnation
found
that
it
couldn't
maintain
list
prices,
there's
own
prices
in
any
market
that
within
a
week
or
so
after
they've
published
their
out
of
dates.
so
it
finally
it
just
left
its
list
prices
as
they
were
and
in
each
market,
the
relatively
short
period
would
come
up
with
a
particular
deal
or
special
offering
for
that
particular
period
to
meet
whatever
the
situation
was
in
that
particular
market.
so
in
every
market
around
in
the
whole
west
of
united
states
where
carnation
was
selling,
it
was
selling
at
different
prices
at
different
times
but
there's
no
pattern
of
any
sustained
discrimination
with
price
differences
between
anyone
in
the
market
and
any
other
market.
now
--
now
with
the
situation
all
through
1958,
so
after
when
this
price
cut
came
the
--
our
prices
were
identical
in
salt
lake
and
in
the
other
market.
in
1959,
carnation
lost
even
more
volume
that
it
had
lost
in
1950
to
the
petitioner,
utah
pie,
in
a
cut
of
66%.
the
--
and
utah
pie
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
$2
a
case.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's'
correct
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
this
is
the
59,
this
is
58,
this
is
66.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
january,
april,
july,
october
january,
in
other
words
this
is
supposed
to
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
--
impact
to
space
out
the
months.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i'm
sure
this
is
number
one.
it's
kind
of
this
way,
implied
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
it's
not
shown,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
it
shown
map
on
page
25
of
my
brief.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
price
is
on
page
13
and
14,
these
would
reflect
the
deals.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
this
would
be
our
net
price
in
each.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
don't
understand
what
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
we
sold
your
honor
the
same
price
to
everyone.
we
had
four
volume
brackets
but
there
was
no
difference
as
between
anybody
and
anyone
who
could
qualify,
got
that
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
only
made
one
sale
at
the
lowest
bracket
in
the
entire
period
in
salt
lake
because
of
the
prices
which
the
plaintiff
was
offering
to
apply
to
these
large
buyers.
we
weren't
able
to
sell
it
to
any
large
buyers,
our
sales
--
sales
roll
to
small
buyers
at
the
higher
price
bracket.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
we're
talking
your
honor
at
the
net
price
at
which
the
pies
were
sold
in
each
market
at
all
particular
time.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
every
market
including
salt
lake,
from
time
to
time
carnation
would
have
promotional
deals
offered.
so
somebody
sends
of
per
case
for
advertising
allowance
and
with
respect
to
--
to
utah,
it
was
called
an
--
an
invoice
allowance
because
utah
has
peculiar
sales
below
con
statute,
but
that
--
and
the
prices
is
shown
on
this
chart.
the
prices
which
are
shown
in
our
brief
are
those
net
prices.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct
sir,
in
each
time.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
and
the
only
time,
the
record
will
show,
the
only
time
we
ever
approach
utah
pie
as
we
--
and
--
in
february
or
march
of
1960
after
we
have
had
two
successive
years
of
potential
losses
of
volume
and
losses
of
markets.
for
1959
we
had
all
--
all
time
law
in
market
sharing.
we
tried
for
a
couple
of
weeks
in
1960,
come
down
to
this
price
level.
it
wasn't
successful
amount
and
what
this
chart
shows
our
prices
then
trended
upwards
during
the
balance
of
a
four-year
period
covered
by
this
lawsuit.
so
that
by
--
in
the
latter
part
of
1960
to
most
of
1961
we
were
entirely
out
of
the
market,
and
the
market
shares
figure
show
that.
all
during
this
period,
the
utah
pie
company
substantially
increased
its
volume
of
the
market
share
primarily
by
the
lower
price
charged
for
it's
utah
brand
secondarily
by
its
special
label
frost
'n
flame
which
came
in
below
any
other
pie
in
the
market
and
captured
one
of
the
largest
buyers
and
it
completely
exclude
us
from
that
particular
market.
now
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no
sir,
you
--
they
are
not.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
there
was
--
there
was
your
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
from
time
to
time
there
was.
our
point
is
that
time
of
any
price
cuts
by
utah
pie
company
there
was
none,
and
our
prices
in
every
market
were
varying
at
all
times
because
--
resulting
from
whatever
particular
competitive
situation
there
was
in
that
particular
market.
and
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
figures
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
figures
at
one
and
two
your
honor
are
--
these
are
also
like
market
prices,
all
through
these
tables
and
they
are
taken
from
actual
invoices.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
doubt
that
that
would
be
so.
the
problem
is
your
honor
and
the
reason
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
question
is
that
the
plaintiff
here
didn't
introduce
any
invoices
with
respect
to
carnation.
it
did
with
respect
to
morton
and
pet,
that's
why
this
record
is
so
long.
all
were
going
to
do
with
respect
to
carnation
were
pricelists
and
then
these
filling
out
since
which
we
made
to
dealers
or
buyers
which
show
that
for
two-week
period
during
march
the
price
be
22
cents
off
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
--
and
from
that
we
were
able
to
compute
what
the
prices
were,
offering
prices
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
particular
sale
at
any
particular
time
by
carnation
in
the
salt
lake
market
or
any
other
markets.
so
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
only
evidence
of
any
price
difference
is
again,
these
list
prices
and
this
deal
offerings
and
all
of
these
other
markets,
there's
no
evidence
of
any
particular
se
--
two
contemporaneous
sales
and
two
different
markets
at
any
price.
one
has
to
sort
of
assume
from
that,
to
that
price
which
these
price
were
sold.
and
that
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
that.
the
point
i
want
to
make
was
that
there
was
no
extended
period
of
price
differences
between
salt
lake
and
any
other
market
for
any
particular
period
of
time.
that
there
was
no
relationship
between
salt
lake
market
and
any
market
because
each
market
our
pies
were
priced
meet
the
competitive
situations
in
that
particular
market.
now,
i
just
want
to
advert,
because
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up
to
the
procedures
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that
may
or
may
not
have
happened.
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
oh,
i
won't
question
that.
as
i
understand
this
court's
statement
that
(voice
overlap)
a
discrimination
within
section
2
(a)
is
a
difference.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
we
don't
--
there
wasn't
an
issue
about
cost
justification,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
in
that
particular
market,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct
sir.
and
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
peter
w.
billings
by
meeting
competition
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
we're
meeting
the
general
market
level
in
each
particular
market.
now,
some
of
these
deal
sheets
which
came
out
which
were
issued
by
the
company
indicated
that
in
market
saint
louis
when
you
pick
for
example,
a
pack
less
introducing
an
offer
in
such
and
such
price
and
so
we
would
come
out
with
such
and
such
a
proposal
which
would
bring
us
down
to
a
point
where
we'll
be
competitive
with
pet
for
that
two
or
three-week
period.
that's
the
type
of
pricing
and
marketing
we
do.
that's
correct.
but
there
was
no
--
as
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
as
i
understand
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
as
i
understand
if
you're
meeting
competition
you
extend
your
market.
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
that
we
were
doing
--
now,
what
we
are
doing
in
--
in
this
case
was
trying
to
stay
in
the
market.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
in
each
projector
market.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
or
to
retain
the
customers
you
have.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
in
each
market
the
customers,
where
evidence
shows
shift
back
and
forth
because
there's
no
brand
loyalty
on
that
being
this
is
purely
a
price
item
and
these
are
all
temporary
price
adjustments
and
they
bounce
from
time
to
time.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired,
i
just
want
to
say
one
--
one
thing
with
respect
to
the
procedural
matter,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
they
did
not
intend
to
leave
any
discretion
with
--
to
the
trial
court
with
respect
to
a
new
trial
and
they
did
it
because
on
this
record
it's
obvious
that
the
petitioner
here
had
every
break
in
the
trial
court.
the
instructions
went
on
his
way,
the
treatment
of
the
evidence
went
on
his
way,
there
was
nothing
that
they
--
and
there's
no
contention
with
respect
to
carnation
that
there
was
any
part
of
this
case
that
was
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
carnation
company,
the
second
of
the
three
individual
defendants
against
whom
these
individual
robinson-patman
act
charges
were
brought.
my
task
this
afternoon
is
to
outline
the
different
facts
with
respect
to
carnation
as
compared
with
the
facts
as
to
the
other
two.
i'm
starting
out
by
saying
a
particular
answer
to
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
this
court
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
several
feed
of
record
here
with
so
far
as
carnation
is
concern.
i
understand
mr.
alioto's
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
that
data
doesn't
particularly
question
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
of
the
facts
as
to
sales,
prices,
volume,
profit,
market
share,
the
key
issues
in
this
case
so
far
as
carnation's
concern,
so
that
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no
sir,
i
do
not.
and
i
think
that
so
far
as
carnation
and
the
kicker
with
respect
to
carnation,
this
court
need
look
no
further.
mr.
alioto
took
exception
with
two
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals
statements,
one
having
to
do
with
bel-air
which
doesn't
concern
carnation.
the
other
had
to
do
with
the
denver
market
which
does
not
concern
carnation.
i
think
all
this
court
need
look
at
is
the
statement
of
facts
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
volume
15
of
the
record.
so
that
--
so
far
it's
concern,
the
task
is
relatively
simple.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
was
correct
in
its
disposition
of
the
case
so
far
as
carnation
is
concerned.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
didn't
mean
to
skip
that
over
rapidly,
your
honor.
what
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
as
i
understand
that
both
petitioner
here
and
the
respondent
carnation
agree
that
the
facts
of
the
evidence
as
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
carnation
is
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that
is
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
oh!
i'm
sure
your
honor
that
if
the
counsel
for
petitioner
thought
that
there
were
some
facts
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
overlooked,
he
have
been
quick
to
point
them
out.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
but
not
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
true
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
those
do
not
concern
carnation
and
that
my
task
here
this
afternoon
is
to
point
out
to
you
why?
that
the
points
which
concern
carnation,
i.e.
the
--
the
prices
of
which
these
frozen
pies
were
sold,
the
volume
which
were
sold
by
each
of
the
parties.
the
profits
which
were
made,
the
market
share
which
was
gain
by
each
of
the
parties
are
not
questioned.
the
evidence
if
in
effect
was
stipulated,
both
parties
introduced
the
market
share
study
for
example.
and
what
i
want
to
do
now,
if
i
may,
would
be
to
turn
to
what
those
facts
on.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
would
say
this
your
honor
that
so
far
as
--
as
the
carnation's
concern
that
reading
any
further
in
this
record
with
respect
to
it
would
not
aid
the
court
in
--
in
determining
that
particular
issue.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
alright,
now
if
i
may,
i'll
turn
then
to
the
facts
with
respect
to
carnation
on
this
key
--
key
argument.
and
i
think
perhaps
maybe
the
best
way
to
do
it
might
be
with
respect
to
taking
it
on
a
year-by-year
basis.
carnation
entered
this
business
in
1955.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
simple
simon,
the
red
line.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
and
it
had
been
in
the
utah
market
since
1955.
in
19
--
late
1957,
early
1958,
the
petitioner
utah
pie
company
entered
the
market
at
this
level
substantially
below
the
level
in
which
carnation
was
selling
its
pies.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
fresh
pie.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
not
the
frozen
pie,
just
the
fresh
pie
market,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
selling
in
grocery
stores
and
so
on.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct.
the
--
the
record
shows
that
they
were
losing
substantial
sums
of
money
in
their
fresh
pie
business
and
that
probably
it
was
one
of
the
motivating
factors
which
why
they
went
in.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
they
came
in
and
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
might
say
why
we're
talking
about
that.
that's
our
position
and
this
is
the
only
relevant
market
concerned
here,
that
of
the
petitioner
sales
there
were
only,
there
was
one
costumer
in
spokane,
washington
as
to
which
it
--
the
--
the
utah
pie
company
sold
f.
o.
b.
in
salt
lake
city
on
a
special
label
basis,
the
sonny
boy
label.
the
other
--
only
other
customer
it
had
of
any
size
or
toll
or
any
volume
outside
of
this
--
in
salt
lake
area
with
which
it
should
be
utah
and
southern
idaho
where
--
where
one
period
in
1959
when
it
sold
some
substantial
sales
of
pumpkin
and
mince.
i
didn't
have
the
record
that
shows
that
about
98%
of
all
their
sales
were
in
the
submitted
area
and
that's
the
area
i'm
talking
about,
that's
what
the
chart
for
example
refers
to,
that's
what
the
market
share
study
refers
to
and
so
on.
as
a
result
of
coming
in
at
this
level,
utah
pie
captured
66%
of
the
market
in
the
salt
lake
area
that
first
year.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
--
it's
like
--
this
is
indulged
in
the
case.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
a
little
about
$2
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
there
are
six
pies
to
a
case.
so
that
two
cases
to
a
dozen
in
effect.
and
that
could
show
the
only,
the
first
prize
cut
being
made
was
right
here
in
1958
and
at
this
time
our
prices
were
way
up
here.
at
that
time
our
prices
were
the
same
in
salt
lake
as
in
san
francisco
and
the
los
angeles.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
los
angeles.
we
only
have
one
plant
your
honor,
in
los
angeles.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes.
now,
with
respect
to
discrimination
which
is
half
of
the
elements
of
a
violation
statute,
i
think
the
most
illustrative
aspect
of
what
carnation
was
doing,
it's
contained
them
the
exhibits
which
are
in
pages
57,
68
and
so
on
in
volume
50
and
on
bond
50
in
this
record,
and
as
i
have
the
one
here
for
southern
california
and
this
is
the
relationship
chart.
the
red
line
b
whether
the
price
in
another
market
this
one,
northern
california
was
higher
or
lower
than
the
mar
--
than
the
price
in
salt
lake
city
which
is
the
center.
it
doesn't
mean
that
salt
lake
city
price
was
constant,
it
was
varied.
but
the
--
the
relationship
was
varied.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
carnation
found
that
it
couldn't
maintain
list
prices,
there's
own
prices
in
any
market
that
within
a
week
or
so
after
they've
published
their
out
of
dates.
so
it
finally
it
just
left
its
list
prices
as
they
were
and
in
each
market,
the
relatively
short
period
would
come
up
with
a
particular
deal
or
special
offering
for
that
particular
period
to
meet
whatever
the
situation
was
in
that
particular
market.
so
in
every
market
around
in
the
whole
west
of
united
states
where
carnation
was
selling,
it
was
selling
at
different
prices
at
different
times
but
there's
no
pattern
of
any
sustained
discrimination
with
price
differences
between
anyone
in
the
market
and
any
other
market.
now
--
now
with
the
situation
all
through
1958,
so
after
when
this
price
cut
came
the
--
our
prices
were
identical
in
salt
lake
and
in
the
other
market.
in
1959,
carnation
lost
even
more
volume
that
it
had
lost
in
1950
to
the
petitioner,
utah
pie,
in
a
cut
of
66%.
the
--
and
utah
pie
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
$2
a
case.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's'
correct
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
this
is
the
59,
this
is
58,
this
is
66.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
january,
april,
july,
october
january,
in
other
words
this
is
supposed
to
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
--
impact
to
space
out
the
months.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i'm
sure
this
is
number
one.
it's
kind
of
this
way,
implied
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
it's
not
shown,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
it
shown
map
on
page
25
of
my
brief.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
price
is
on
page
13
and
14,
these
would
reflect
the
deals.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
this
would
be
our
net
price
in
each.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
don't
understand
what
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
we
sold
your
honor
the
same
price
to
everyone.
we
had
four
volume
brackets
but
there
was
no
difference
as
between
anybody
and
anyone
who
could
qualify,
got
that
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
only
made
one
sale
at
the
lowest
bracket
in
the
entire
period
in
salt
lake
because
of
the
prices
which
the
plaintiff
was
offering
to
apply
to
these
large
buyers.
we
weren't
able
to
sell
it
to
any
large
buyers,
our
sales
--
sales
roll
to
small
buyers
at
the
higher
price
bracket.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
we're
talking
your
honor
at
the
net
price
at
which
the
pies
were
sold
in
each
market
at
all
particular
time.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
every
market
including
salt
lake,
from
time
to
time
carnation
would
have
promotional
deals
offered.
so
somebody
sends
of
per
case
for
advertising
allowance
and
with
respect
to
--
to
utah,
it
was
called
an
--
an
invoice
allowance
because
utah
has
peculiar
sales
below
con
statute,
but
that
--
and
the
prices
is
shown
on
this
chart.
the
prices
which
are
shown
in
our
brief
are
those
net
prices.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct
sir,
in
each
time.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
and
the
only
time,
the
record
will
show,
the
only
time
we
ever
approach
utah
pie
as
we
--
and
--
in
february
or
march
of
1960
after
we
have
had
two
successive
years
of
potential
losses
of
volume
and
losses
of
markets.
for
1959
we
had
all
--
all
time
law
in
market
sharing.
we
tried
for
a
couple
of
weeks
in
1960,
come
down
to
this
price
level.
it
wasn't
successful
amount
and
what
this
chart
shows
our
prices
then
trended
upwards
during
the
balance
of
a
four-year
period
covered
by
this
lawsuit.
so
that
by
--
in
the
latter
part
of
1960
to
most
of
1961
we
were
entirely
out
of
the
market,
and
the
market
shares
figure
show
that.
all
during
this
period,
the
utah
pie
company
substantially
increased
its
volume
of
the
market
share
primarily
by
the
lower
price
charged
for
it's
utah
brand
secondarily
by
its
special
label
frost
'n
flame
which
came
in
below
any
other
pie
in
the
market
and
captured
one
of
the
largest
buyers
and
it
completely
exclude
us
from
that
particular
market.
now
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
no
sir,
you
--
they
are
not.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
there
was
--
there
was
your
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
from
time
to
time
there
was.
our
point
is
that
time
of
any
price
cuts
by
utah
pie
company
there
was
none,
and
our
prices
in
every
market
were
varying
at
all
times
because
--
resulting
from
whatever
particular
competitive
situation
there
was
in
that
particular
market.
and
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
figures
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
the
figures
at
one
and
two
your
honor
are
--
these
are
also
like
market
prices,
all
through
these
tables
and
they
are
taken
from
actual
invoices.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
i
doubt
that
that
would
be
so.
the
problem
is
your
honor
and
the
reason
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
question
is
that
the
plaintiff
here
didn't
introduce
any
invoices
with
respect
to
carnation.
it
did
with
respect
to
morton
and
pet,
that's
why
this
record
is
so
long.
all
were
going
to
do
with
respect
to
carnation
were
pricelists
and
then
these
filling
out
since
which
we
made
to
dealers
or
buyers
which
show
that
for
two-week
period
during
march
the
price
be
22
cents
off
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
--
and
from
that
we
were
able
to
compute
what
the
prices
were,
offering
prices
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
particular
sale
at
any
particular
time
by
carnation
in
the
salt
lake
market
or
any
other
markets.
so
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
only
evidence
of
any
price
difference
is
again,
these
list
prices
and
this
deal
offerings
and
all
of
these
other
markets,
there's
no
evidence
of
any
particular
se
--
two
contemporaneous
sales
and
two
different
markets
at
any
price.
one
has
to
sort
of
assume
from
that,
to
that
price
which
these
price
were
sold.
and
that
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
that.
the
point
i
want
to
make
was
that
there
was
no
extended
period
of
price
differences
between
salt
lake
and
any
other
market
for
any
particular
period
of
time.
that
there
was
no
relationship
between
salt
lake
market
and
any
market
because
each
market
our
pies
were
priced
meet
the
competitive
situations
in
that
particular
market.
now,
i
just
want
to
advert,
because
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up
to
the
procedures
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that
may
or
may
not
have
happened.
your
honor.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
oh,
i
won't
question
that.
as
i
understand
this
court's
statement
that
(voice
overlap)
a
discrimination
within
section
2
(a)
is
a
difference.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
we
don't
--
there
wasn't
an
issue
about
cost
justification,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
that
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
in
that
particular
market,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
that's
correct
sir.
and
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
peter
w.
billings
by
meeting
competition
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
we're
meeting
the
general
market
level
in
each
particular
market.
now,
some
of
these
deal
sheets
which
came
out
which
were
issued
by
the
company
indicated
that
in
market
saint
louis
when
you
pick
for
example,
a
pack
less
introducing
an
offer
in
such
and
such
price
and
so
we
would
come
out
with
such
and
such
a
proposal
which
would
bring
us
down
to
a
point
where
we'll
be
competitive
with
pet
for
that
two
or
three-week
period.
that's
the
type
of
pricing
and
marketing
we
do.
that's
correct.
but
there
was
no
--
as
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
as
i
understand
--
mr.
peter
w.
billings
as
i
understand
if
you're
meeting
competition
you
extend
your
market.
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
that
we
were
doing
--
now,
what
we
are
doing
in
--
in
this
case
was
trying
to
stay
in
the
market.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
in
each
projector
market.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
or
to
retain
the
customers
you
have.
mr.
peter
w.
billings
well,
in
each
market
the
customers,
where
evidence
shows
shift
back
and
forth
because
there's
no
brand
loyalty
on
that
being
this
is
purely
a
price
item
and
these
are
all
temporary
price
adjustments
and
they
bounce
from
time
to
time.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired,
i
just
want
to
say
one
--
one
thing
with
respect
to
the
procedural
matter,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
they
did
not
intend
to
leave
any
discretion
with
--
to
the
trial
court
with
respect
to
a
new
trial
and
they
did
it
because
on
this
record
it's
obvious
that
the
petitioner
here
had
every
break
in
the
trial
court.
the
instructions
went
on
his
way,
the
treatment
of
the
evidence
went
on
his
way,
there
was
nothing
that
they
--
and
there's
no
contention
with
respect
to
carnation
that
there
was
any
part
of
this
case
that
was
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
