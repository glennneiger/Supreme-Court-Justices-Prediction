mr.
george
p.
lamb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
the
pet
milk
company,
i
would
like
to
focus
two
of
the
important
issues
which
have
been
made
by
the
utah
pie
company
in
this
case.
they
contend
that
because
pet
occasionally
had
a
different
price
between
california
and
salt
lake
city,
utah
even
though
they
never
met
the
utah
price
or
never
beat
the
utah
price,
that
fact
is
a
violation
of
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
utah
pie
company
says
secondly,
that
if
the
pet
milk
company
has
desires
of
selling
frozen
fruit
pies
in
salt
lake
city
at
a
lower
price
than
it
sells
in
los
angeles
or
san
francisco
that
it
must
build
a
plant
in
salt
lake
city.
now
these
two
issues
were
before
the
jury
and
they
were
contested
by
virtue
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
they
were
before
the
tenth
circuit.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
decided
that
there
was
an
insufficiency
of
evidence,
these
two
points
were
passed
over.
consequently,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
evidence,
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
or
this
court
itself
should
answer
those
two
questions
in
order
that
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
to
try
the
case
again,
we
will
know
precisely
what
the
law
is
on
those
two
questions.
now
briefly,
that
the
pet
milk
company,
in
about
1954
when
their
sales
of
evaporated
milk
were
going
downhill
in
due
--
due
to
the
change
of
economics
in
this
country,
they
started
too
diversify
their
products
and
they
were
looking
around
for
products
would
get
what
they
called
convenience
foods.
and
they
started
applying
the
frozen
fruit
pie
which
was
a
brand
new
product.
this
was
being
manufactured
in
beulah,
michigan
by
a
man,
by
the
name
of
pet
ritz,
that's
where
the
name
pet-ritz
comes
from.
he
was
making
frozen
cherry
pies
in
beulah,
michigan,
the
president
of
the
pet
milk
company
had
a
summer
home
up
there
and
he
bought
one
of
these
pies
and
found
what
a
delicious
pie
it
was,
what
a
great
idea
it
was
to
have
frozen
fruit
pies.
he
acquired
the
beulah
plant,
moved
it
the
frankfort,
michigan,
used
the
test
market
in
chicago,
detroit,
toledo,
and
milwaukee
and
found
that
there
was
tremendous
acceptance
for
this
high
quality
eight-inch,
24-ounce
pie.pet
being
a
company
that
dealt
in
national
distribution,
it
immediately
established
a
plant
with
the
chambersburg,
pennsylvania
and
in
fresno,
california
in
order
to
serve
the
entire
market
throughout
the
united
states.
now,
pet
had
been
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
for
many,
many
years,
selling
ice
creams,
selling
evaporated
milk,
selling
dairy
products,
they
weren't
new
in
the
salt
lake
market.
they
entered
the
salt
lake
market
1955
with
this
frozen
fruit
pie,
two
years
before
the
utah
pie
company
ever
went
in
the
frozen
pie
business.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
utah
pie
company
was
in
the
fresh
pie
business
from
1927
up
to
the
latter
time.
now,
the
utah
pie
company
entered
the
frozen
pie
business
in
late
1957
which
is
two
years
after
pet
had.
now,
when
pet
went
into
this
frozen
pie
business
it
did
precisely
what
most
progressive
companies
do
when
they
enter
a
market
with
the
new
product.
they
engaged
in
some
very
costly
advertising
and
promotion.
in
the
first
year,
1957,
they
spent
over
$900,000
on
television
and
radio
programs
and
in-store
promotions.
the
following
year,
they
spent
some
over
$800,000.
they
went
along
for
about
three
years
and
the
first
thing
you
know
they
noticed
that
that
small
fresh
fruit
pie
companies
throughout
the
entire
united
states
could
enter
this
business
with
practically
no
difficulty
whatsoever.
as
a
consequence,
it
was
extremely
hard
for
them
to
bring
themselves
into
a
profit
position
because
they
were
spending
so
much
on
a
promotion.
now,
they
didn't
do
anything
differently
than
ford
motor
car
company
did
when
they
spend
$160
million
to
tool-up
on
the
mustang
and
a
million
dollars
in
the
advertising
in
the
first
13
weeks
when
they
put
that
car
up.
if
you
wanted
to
buy
a
mustang
at
cost,
it
would
probably
cost
you
about
a
$150,000
if
you
bought
the
first
car
up
the
line.
i
can
remember
about
a
number
of
years
ago,
i
asked
an
executive
friend
of
mine
in
westinghouse,
if
he'd
get
me
a
colored
television
at
the
said
cost,
he
said
"well,
i'll
have
a
little
difficulty
getting
it
--
getting
you
one
at
this
price.
but
i'm
sure
the
company
will
be
delighted
to
sell
you
what
it
cost
because
they're
costing
us
$49,000
a
piece
as
they're
coming
off
of
the
line
at
this
time."
pet's
cost
in
introducing
the
frozen
fruit
pie
throughout
the
united
states
where
prohibiting
in
these
first
years
and
this
small
independent
fresh
pie
companies
that
ought
to
get
into
the
business
got
in
after
the
consumer
acceptance
had
been
build
up
at
a
very
high
cost,
then
immediately
brought
one
of
its
top
executive
in
to
examine
this
situation
to
find
out
if
they
could
bring
in
into
a
proper
position.
they
cut
this
out
a
thousand
cost
from
$900,000
to
$42,000.
they
had
a
market
shares
study
done
by
the
market
research
corporation
of
chicago
and
that
company
advised
them
that
they
have
to
get
into
an
economy
pie,
if
the
american
public,
the
housewife
wanted
a
quality
pie
and
an
economy
pie
as
a
consequence
pet
got
into
the
swiss
miss
with
a
20-ounce
pie
as
distinguished
from
a
24-ounce
pie.
in
addition,
they
discover
that
the
competition
at
the
chain
store
level
is
so
great
that
they
have
to
get
into
the
private
label
business
that
they
therefore
started
negotiations
with
safeway
to
build
a
manufacture
for
them
frozen
pies
under
the
bel-air
label
which
gives
a
label
that's
owned
by
safeway
stores.
now,
after
the
utah
pie
company
went
into
the
frozen
pie
business,
what
happened
to
it?
their
first
full
year
in
the
business,
they
sold
69,000
dozen
frozen
fruit
pies
in
the
salt
--
salt
lake
city
market.
they
increase
their
sales
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
until
1961
that
the
utah
pie
company
sold
248,000
cases
of
frozen
fruit
pies.
they
had
a
loss
in
1957
of
$5400.
in
1961,
they
increased
the
profits
of
the
utah
pie
company
to
$30,000.
they
have
nine
member
of
the
rigby
family
working
at
the
small
plant.
they
increased
their
salaries
from
1961
from
$57,000
to
$82,000.
they
have
a
great
successful
frozen
fruit
pie
business
in
the
salt
lake
markets.
they
made
one
mistake
as
judge
phillips
said
in
his
opinion.
they
were
the
arch
price
cutter
in
the
market.
rather
than
going
in
with
promotion
methods
taking
advantage
of
their
utah
brand
name
which
was
known
in
that
market,
doing
in-store
promotions
rather
than
merchandising
their
product,
they
decided
that
the
way
to
get
their
business
was
to
do
it
by
cut
prices
and
by
severe
cut
prices.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
not
what
pet
did
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
yes,
brought
out
the
swiss
miss
pie
which
was
a
20-ounce
pie,
it
was
of
different
quality
and
it
was
priced
in
relation
to
the
20
ounces
as
against
the
24
ounces.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
the
market
research
corporation
of
chicago
made
a
study
recommended
to
pet
that
if
they're
going
to
stay
in
the
frozen
pie
business
and
get
into
the
proper
position
they
have
to
make
two
pies
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
one
of
an
eight-inch,
24-ounce
pie
and
two,
an
eight-inch,
20-ounce
pie.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
--
get
sufficient
volume
and
then
probably,
and
reduce
their
advertising
cost
and
add
innovation
such
as
--
of
trade
problems
combining
our
shipments
and
so
forth
and
reduce
their
cost
such
as
was
done
in
the
balian
ice
cream
case
and
they
would
bring
themselves
back
into
a
proper
position.
now,
in
the
lower
court,
your
honors,
i
introduced
--
i
have
a
study
made
by
drs.
lambourne
and
anderson
who
are
the
economist
at
utah
state
university,
and
my
appellant
here
mr.
alioto,
seized
my
market
share
study
and
introduced
it
for
me,
got
in
the
evidence
before
i
had
a
chance
to
introduce
it
myself.
my
chart
here
838
was
introduced
by
mr.
alioto
and
also
the
market
share
study
was
introduced
by
him
and
it's
him
who
gets
in
the
record
and
shows
you
the
relative
position
of
these
three
respondents
and
of
the
utah
pie
company.
now,
each
case
has
six
parts.
now,
this
--
this
chart
shows
the
purple
line
here
is
the
pet-ritz
pie
which
is
the
24-ounce,
eight-inch
pie
manufactured
by
the
pet
milk
company.
the
red
line
is
the
simple
simon
pie
manufactured
by
carnation.
the
orange
line
here
is
the
utah
pie
line.
the
dotted
purple
line
is
the
bel-air
pie
and
the
swiss
miss,
purple
is
the
20-ounce
pet
pie
and
across
to
the
plain,
orange
is
the
utah
private
labeled
pie
and
the
green
is
the
continental
pie.
now,
this
bel-air
is
a
misleading
situation.
the
safeway
company
purchases
its
frozen
fruit
pies
from
an
f.
o.
b.
mail
basis.
therefore,
if
you
are
to
get
a
true
picture
of
a
bel-air
price,
you
have
to
have
add
the
freight
from
fresno,
california
to
salt
lake.
all
of
the
rest
of
these
pies
are
sold
on
a
delivery
price
basis.
ironically,
i
have
had
an
overlay
made
to
show
what
happens
when
you
add
up
--
add
the
freight
to
the
bel-air
price.
well,
i
use
16
cents
which
is
a
mean
between
32
and
35
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
alioto's
expert
witness,
an
accountant
said
that
the
price
per
dozen
from
fresno
to
salt
lake
city
was
48
cents.
i
use
the
smaller
figure
of
16
cents.
now,
when
you
add
the
16
cents
to
the
price
of
bel-air
pies,
you
will
see
that
the
price
of
the
bel-air
safeway
pie
is
above
the
utah
brand
pie,
it's
also
above
the
frost
'n
flame
pie.
now,
your
honors
when
this
study
was
made
by
professors
lambourne
and
anderson.
they
collected
actual
invoices
of
the
sales
made
to
the
leading
wholesalers
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
these
are
actual
prices
taken
from
invoices
of
each
one
of
the
--
of
pet,
carnation,
continental
and
utah.
as
a
consequence,
you
have
a
picture
here
which
shows
in
relation
to
the
pet
case
that
pet
never
at
any
time
lowered
its
price
even
equal
to
utah
much
less
bidding.
now,
one
addition
in
order
to
factor
out
the
20-ounce
pie
to
a
24-ounce
pie,
i
have
had
an
overlay
here
which
shows
when
the
swiss
miss
is
made
into
a
24-ounce
pie,
the
line
goes
above
the
utah
brand
label
and
all
go
above
the
frost
'n
flame
label.
as
a
consequence,
pet
never
meant
and
never
beat
the
utah
prices
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
now,
this
is
very
important
as
far
as
robinson-patman
act
case
is
concerned,
we're
going
to
talk
about
a
primary
line
case,
the
main
primary
line
cases
which
we
have
are
the
mead
versus
moore,
atlas
building
block,
maryland
baking,
what
happened
if
those
predatory
price
discrimination
did
wrap
up
the
cases,
was
a
severe
price
dive
that
went
below
and
stayed
below
and
drove
the
object
of
that
price
cut
out
of
business
or
diverted
substantial
business
from
that
individual,
that
was
not
the
case
in
the
case
of
utah.
the
case
was
exactly
the
opposite.
the
utah
pie
company
thrived.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
no
damage
done
to
utah,
no
damage
done
to
the
competition.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
and
therefore,
no
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
p.
lamb
there
was
a
difference
in
price
and
based
on
the
definition
of
anheuser-busch
of
this
court,
you
could
call
it
a
discrimination.
but
as
far
as
it
is
being
a
--
an
illegal
discrimination
under
section
2
(a)
of
robinson-patman
act,
it
was
not.
it
neither
injured
a
competitor
nor
did
it
injure
competition.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that
this
was
their
fight
brand.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well
they
had
a
--
sonny
boy,
your
honor
up
in
the
northwest
and
then
their
utah
brand
here,
this
brand.
this
--
this
is
an
eight-inch,
24-ounce
pie,
a
quality
pie
which
is
directly
competitive
with
the
pet-ritz,
with
the
bel-air,
and
with
carnation,
directly
competitive.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well,
that
was
a
private
labeled
manufactured
by
utah
for
associated
groceries.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well,
this
is
one
of
them,
frost
'n
flame,
and
the
sonny
boy
was
another
one
and
may
fresh
was
another
one.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
as
far
as
the
utah
pie
company
was
concerned.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
talking
about
the
whole
line.
talking
about
their
whole
line,
as
far
as
our
situation
is
concerned
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
correct.
well
three,
swiss
miss,
bel-air
and
pet-ritz.
we
sold
this
to
the
private
labeled
safeway,
bel-air.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
no.
bel-air
is
the
exactly
comparable
to
pet-ritz.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
it's
an
eight-inch,
24-ounce
quality
pie.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
made
--
made
to
the
specifications
of
the
safeway.
that
i
might
say
here
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
utah
was
24-ounce,
swiss
miss
was
20-ounce.
and
--
and
swiss
miss
was
not
the
same
quality
either,
it
had
less
fruits.
and
it
was
a
--
it
was
definitely
an
economy
pie
and
was
priced
low
for
the
economy
market.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
when
you
factor
those
out
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
--
it
goes
up
here.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
it's
just
like
saying
whether
or
not
you
know
the
difference
between
a
cadillac
and
a
chevrolet.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
i
think
--
i
think
you
have
to.
i
think
--
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
injury
proving
the
competition
or
an
injury
to
the
competitor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well,
i
think
that's
an
important
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
not
--
not
always
true.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
for
a
few
moments
to
the
predatory
tactics
referred
to
by
mr.
alioto.
first
of
all,
for
a
guy
who
did
a
visit
to
the
utah
pie
company
and
we
certainly
don't
condone
that
was
a
highly
unfortunate
thing,
it
was
an
isolated
instance,
it
was
only
done
once,
has
no
comparison
with
a
long
planned
efforts
that
were
made
in
standard
oil,
american
tobacco,
and
so
forth.
it
was
certainly
then
advised
and
the
young
man
who
did
it
was
severely
chastised
for
it.
if
you
read
our
footnote
8
on
page
59,
i
put
the
whole
report
in
my
brief
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
doubt
about
what
he
said.
it's
complimentary
whether
than
anything
else.
it
was
--
it
was
never
used
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
young,
the
chief
buyer
for
safeway,
according
to
mr.
deitman,
the
chief
contract
officer
for
pet,
it
was
never
used
in
any
respect
to
--
to
dan
--
endanger
the
utah
pie
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
this
question
to
safeway
sales
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that
was
the
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine,
yes
your
honor.
it
was.
i
do
think
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
--
in
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
i
think
that
such
as
in
the
--
in
the
general
electric
case
there
is
some
discussion
of
this
type
of
--
of
strong
competition
and
i
think
your
honor
that
this
is
certainly
wasn't
an
unfortunate
incident.
it
was
only
one
incident,
it
was
isolated
and
i
think
it's
been
blown
of
all
out
of
proportions
in
this
case.
but
nevertheless,
under
matters
of
circumstances
most
companies
that
gives
exchange
visits
back
and
forth
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
yes
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
true,
that
it
could
have
impressed
the
jury.
well,
i
brought
mr.
shank,
the
man
who
did
it.
i
put
him
on
as
my
witness
and
gave
mr.
alioto
full
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
and
introduce
the
whole
thing
in
evidence,
so
it
was
clear
open
book.
i
told
the
jury
precisely
what
happened,
what
an
unfortunate
thing
it
was.
i
think
actually
if
the
two
companies
that
said
let's
exchange
visits
to
our
respective
plants
that
would
have
been
done
that
way.
because
that's
more
modern
and
it
is
something
that
i
think
it's
going
to
be
blown
out
of
proportion.
now,
on
its
investment
spending
that
mr.
alioto
speaks
to,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
i
think
that
this
is
partially
what's
done
in
introducing
new
products
in
the
market.
there
has
to
be
research
and
development
cost,
there
has
to
be
promotion
cost,
and
so
on.
the
swiss
miss
brand
was
not
a
fighting
ship.
the
swiss
miss
brand
was
an
attempt
to
meet
a
demand
in
--
in
the
marketplace.
now,
your
honors,
in
summary,
in
so
far
as
the
procedural
question
is
concerned.
i'd
like
to
say
this
that
mr.
alioto
lost
on
the
conspiracy
count
below.
he
was
asking
for
$750,000
from
pet
treble
and
he
got
$44,000
treble.
mr.
alioto
is
one
of
the
most
skillful
line
cost
lawyers
in
the
country.
now,
his
--
his
utah
pie
company
was
very
ably
represented
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
judge
sustained
him
a
187
times
and
sustained
the
defendants
in
this
case
15
times.
that
the
--
mr.
--
mr.
alioto
if
--
if
he
had
any
idea
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
needed
a
new
trial
on
this
conspiracy
count,
he
would
have
made
a
motion
to
that
effect.
he
did
not
do
that
because
of
the
disparity
in
the
--
in
the
verdict,
the
$750,000
versus
$44,000.
i'm
sure
if
he
had
thought
he
had
grounds
a
new
trial,
he
would
have
made
it
and
then
he
had
another
chance
to
make
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
didn't
make
any
motion
for
a
new
trial
there.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
2106
has
the
power
as
this
court
does
and
we
do
not
think
that
if
litigation
is
going
to
be
ultimately
ended
that
rule
50
(d)
has
to
be
construed
by
this
court
or
it
has
to
be
amended,
changed
and
clarified
in
order
to
make
sure
that
litigation
stops
some
place
and
we
think
under
the
circumstances
in
that
respect
that
as
far
as
the
procedural
question
is
concerned
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
right
to
do
what
they
did
and
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
entered
for
--
for
the
pet
milk
company
as
--
as
directed
by
the
tenth
circuit.
now,
we
think
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
that
the
court
can
conclude
that
certiorari
in
the
pet
case
was
improperly
granted
and
can
reverse
itself
on
certiorari
and
allow
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
to
stand.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
the
pet
milk
company,
i
would
like
to
focus
two
of
the
important
issues
which
have
been
made
by
the
utah
pie
company
in
this
case.
they
contend
that
because
pet
occasionally
had
a
different
price
between
california
and
salt
lake
city,
utah
even
though
they
never
met
the
utah
price
or
never
beat
the
utah
price,
that
fact
is
a
violation
of
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
utah
pie
company
says
secondly,
that
if
the
pet
milk
company
has
desires
of
selling
frozen
fruit
pies
in
salt
lake
city
at
a
lower
price
than
it
sells
in
los
angeles
or
san
francisco
that
it
must
build
a
plant
in
salt
lake
city.
now
these
two
issues
were
before
the
jury
and
they
were
contested
by
virtue
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
they
were
before
the
tenth
circuit.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
decided
that
there
was
an
insufficiency
of
evidence,
these
two
points
were
passed
over.
consequently,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
evidence,
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
or
this
court
itself
should
answer
those
two
questions
in
order
that
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
to
try
the
case
again,
we
will
know
precisely
what
the
law
is
on
those
two
questions.
now
briefly,
that
the
pet
milk
company,
in
about
1954
when
their
sales
of
evaporated
milk
were
going
downhill
in
due
--
due
to
the
change
of
economics
in
this
country,
they
started
too
diversify
their
products
and
they
were
looking
around
for
products
would
get
what
they
called
convenience
foods.
and
they
started
applying
the
frozen
fruit
pie
which
was
a
brand
new
product.
this
was
being
manufactured
in
beulah,
michigan
by
a
man,
by
the
name
of
pet
ritz,
that's
where
the
name
pet-ritz
comes
from.
he
was
making
frozen
cherry
pies
in
beulah,
michigan,
the
president
of
the
pet
milk
company
had
a
summer
home
up
there
and
he
bought
one
of
these
pies
and
found
what
a
delicious
pie
it
was,
what
a
great
idea
it
was
to
have
frozen
fruit
pies.
he
acquired
the
beulah
plant,
moved
it
the
frankfort,
michigan,
used
the
test
market
in
chicago,
detroit,
toledo,
and
milwaukee
and
found
that
there
was
tremendous
acceptance
for
this
high
quality
eight-inch,
24-ounce
pie.pet
being
a
company
that
dealt
in
national
distribution,
it
immediately
established
a
plant
with
the
chambersburg,
pennsylvania
and
in
fresno,
california
in
order
to
serve
the
entire
market
throughout
the
united
states.
now,
pet
had
been
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
for
many,
many
years,
selling
ice
creams,
selling
evaporated
milk,
selling
dairy
products,
they
weren't
new
in
the
salt
lake
market.
they
entered
the
salt
lake
market
1955
with
this
frozen
fruit
pie,
two
years
before
the
utah
pie
company
ever
went
in
the
frozen
pie
business.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
utah
pie
company
was
in
the
fresh
pie
business
from
1927
up
to
the
latter
time.
now,
the
utah
pie
company
entered
the
frozen
pie
business
in
late
1957
which
is
two
years
after
pet
had.
now,
when
pet
went
into
this
frozen
pie
business
it
did
precisely
what
most
progressive
companies
do
when
they
enter
a
market
with
the
new
product.
they
engaged
in
some
very
costly
advertising
and
promotion.
in
the
first
year,
1957,
they
spent
over
$900,000
on
television
and
radio
programs
and
in-store
promotions.
the
following
year,
they
spent
some
over
$800,000.
they
went
along
for
about
three
years
and
the
first
thing
you
know
they
noticed
that
that
small
fresh
fruit
pie
companies
throughout
the
entire
united
states
could
enter
this
business
with
practically
no
difficulty
whatsoever.
as
a
consequence,
it
was
extremely
hard
for
them
to
bring
themselves
into
a
profit
position
because
they
were
spending
so
much
on
a
promotion.
now,
they
didn't
do
anything
differently
than
ford
motor
car
company
did
when
they
spend
$160
million
to
tool-up
on
the
mustang
and
a
million
dollars
in
the
advertising
in
the
first
13
weeks
when
they
put
that
car
up.
if
you
wanted
to
buy
a
mustang
at
cost,
it
would
probably
cost
you
about
a
$150,000
if
you
bought
the
first
car
up
the
line.
i
can
remember
about
a
number
of
years
ago,
i
asked
an
executive
friend
of
mine
in
westinghouse,
if
he'd
get
me
a
colored
television
at
the
said
cost,
he
said
"well,
i'll
have
a
little
difficulty
getting
it
--
getting
you
one
at
this
price.
but
i'm
sure
the
company
will
be
delighted
to
sell
you
what
it
cost
because
they're
costing
us
$49,000
a
piece
as
they're
coming
off
of
the
line
at
this
time."
pet's
cost
in
introducing
the
frozen
fruit
pie
throughout
the
united
states
where
prohibiting
in
these
first
years
and
this
small
independent
fresh
pie
companies
that
ought
to
get
into
the
business
got
in
after
the
consumer
acceptance
had
been
build
up
at
a
very
high
cost,
then
immediately
brought
one
of
its
top
executive
in
to
examine
this
situation
to
find
out
if
they
could
bring
in
into
a
proper
position.
they
cut
this
out
a
thousand
cost
from
$900,000
to
$42,000.
they
had
a
market
shares
study
done
by
the
market
research
corporation
of
chicago
and
that
company
advised
them
that
they
have
to
get
into
an
economy
pie,
if
the
american
public,
the
housewife
wanted
a
quality
pie
and
an
economy
pie
as
a
consequence
pet
got
into
the
swiss
miss
with
a
20-ounce
pie
as
distinguished
from
a
24-ounce
pie.
in
addition,
they
discover
that
the
competition
at
the
chain
store
level
is
so
great
that
they
have
to
get
into
the
private
label
business
that
they
therefore
started
negotiations
with
safeway
to
build
a
manufacture
for
them
frozen
pies
under
the
bel-air
label
which
gives
a
label
that's
owned
by
safeway
stores.
now,
after
the
utah
pie
company
went
into
the
frozen
pie
business,
what
happened
to
it?
their
first
full
year
in
the
business,
they
sold
69,000
dozen
frozen
fruit
pies
in
the
salt
--
salt
lake
city
market.
they
increase
their
sales
in
the
salt
lake
city
market
until
1961
that
the
utah
pie
company
sold
248,000
cases
of
frozen
fruit
pies.
they
had
a
loss
in
1957
of
$5400.
in
1961,
they
increased
the
profits
of
the
utah
pie
company
to
$30,000.
they
have
nine
member
of
the
rigby
family
working
at
the
small
plant.
they
increased
their
salaries
from
1961
from
$57,000
to
$82,000.
they
have
a
great
successful
frozen
fruit
pie
business
in
the
salt
lake
markets.
they
made
one
mistake
as
judge
phillips
said
in
his
opinion.
they
were
the
arch
price
cutter
in
the
market.
rather
than
going
in
with
promotion
methods
taking
advantage
of
their
utah
brand
name
which
was
known
in
that
market,
doing
in-store
promotions
rather
than
merchandising
their
product,
they
decided
that
the
way
to
get
their
business
was
to
do
it
by
cut
prices
and
by
severe
cut
prices.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
not
what
pet
did
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
yes,
brought
out
the
swiss
miss
pie
which
was
a
20-ounce
pie,
it
was
of
different
quality
and
it
was
priced
in
relation
to
the
20
ounces
as
against
the
24
ounces.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
the
market
research
corporation
of
chicago
made
a
study
recommended
to
pet
that
if
they're
going
to
stay
in
the
frozen
pie
business
and
get
into
the
proper
position
they
have
to
make
two
pies
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
one
of
an
eight-inch,
24-ounce
pie
and
two,
an
eight-inch,
20-ounce
pie.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
--
get
sufficient
volume
and
then
probably,
and
reduce
their
advertising
cost
and
add
innovation
such
as
--
of
trade
problems
combining
our
shipments
and
so
forth
and
reduce
their
cost
such
as
was
done
in
the
balian
ice
cream
case
and
they
would
bring
themselves
back
into
a
proper
position.
now,
in
the
lower
court,
your
honors,
i
introduced
--
i
have
a
study
made
by
drs.
lambourne
and
anderson
who
are
the
economist
at
utah
state
university,
and
my
appellant
here
mr.
alioto,
seized
my
market
share
study
and
introduced
it
for
me,
got
in
the
evidence
before
i
had
a
chance
to
introduce
it
myself.
my
chart
here
838
was
introduced
by
mr.
alioto
and
also
the
market
share
study
was
introduced
by
him
and
it's
him
who
gets
in
the
record
and
shows
you
the
relative
position
of
these
three
respondents
and
of
the
utah
pie
company.
now,
each
case
has
six
parts.
now,
this
--
this
chart
shows
the
purple
line
here
is
the
pet-ritz
pie
which
is
the
24-ounce,
eight-inch
pie
manufactured
by
the
pet
milk
company.
the
red
line
is
the
simple
simon
pie
manufactured
by
carnation.
the
orange
line
here
is
the
utah
pie
line.
the
dotted
purple
line
is
the
bel-air
pie
and
the
swiss
miss,
purple
is
the
20-ounce
pet
pie
and
across
to
the
plain,
orange
is
the
utah
private
labeled
pie
and
the
green
is
the
continental
pie.
now,
this
bel-air
is
a
misleading
situation.
the
safeway
company
purchases
its
frozen
fruit
pies
from
an
f.
o.
b.
mail
basis.
therefore,
if
you
are
to
get
a
true
picture
of
a
bel-air
price,
you
have
to
have
add
the
freight
from
fresno,
california
to
salt
lake.
all
of
the
rest
of
these
pies
are
sold
on
a
delivery
price
basis.
ironically,
i
have
had
an
overlay
made
to
show
what
happens
when
you
add
up
--
add
the
freight
to
the
bel-air
price.
well,
i
use
16
cents
which
is
a
mean
between
32
and
35
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
alioto's
expert
witness,
an
accountant
said
that
the
price
per
dozen
from
fresno
to
salt
lake
city
was
48
cents.
i
use
the
smaller
figure
of
16
cents.
now,
when
you
add
the
16
cents
to
the
price
of
bel-air
pies,
you
will
see
that
the
price
of
the
bel-air
safeway
pie
is
above
the
utah
brand
pie,
it's
also
above
the
frost
'n
flame
pie.
now,
your
honors
when
this
study
was
made
by
professors
lambourne
and
anderson.
they
collected
actual
invoices
of
the
sales
made
to
the
leading
wholesalers
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
these
are
actual
prices
taken
from
invoices
of
each
one
of
the
--
of
pet,
carnation,
continental
and
utah.
as
a
consequence,
you
have
a
picture
here
which
shows
in
relation
to
the
pet
case
that
pet
never
at
any
time
lowered
its
price
even
equal
to
utah
much
less
bidding.
now,
one
addition
in
order
to
factor
out
the
20-ounce
pie
to
a
24-ounce
pie,
i
have
had
an
overlay
here
which
shows
when
the
swiss
miss
is
made
into
a
24-ounce
pie,
the
line
goes
above
the
utah
brand
label
and
all
go
above
the
frost
'n
flame
label.
as
a
consequence,
pet
never
meant
and
never
beat
the
utah
prices
in
the
salt
lake
city
market.
now,
this
is
very
important
as
far
as
robinson-patman
act
case
is
concerned,
we're
going
to
talk
about
a
primary
line
case,
the
main
primary
line
cases
which
we
have
are
the
mead
versus
moore,
atlas
building
block,
maryland
baking,
what
happened
if
those
predatory
price
discrimination
did
wrap
up
the
cases,
was
a
severe
price
dive
that
went
below
and
stayed
below
and
drove
the
object
of
that
price
cut
out
of
business
or
diverted
substantial
business
from
that
individual,
that
was
not
the
case
in
the
case
of
utah.
the
case
was
exactly
the
opposite.
the
utah
pie
company
thrived.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
no
damage
done
to
utah,
no
damage
done
to
the
competition.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
and
therefore,
no
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
p.
lamb
there
was
a
difference
in
price
and
based
on
the
definition
of
anheuser-busch
of
this
court,
you
could
call
it
a
discrimination.
but
as
far
as
it
is
being
a
--
an
illegal
discrimination
under
section
2
(a)
of
robinson-patman
act,
it
was
not.
it
neither
injured
a
competitor
nor
did
it
injure
competition.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that
this
was
their
fight
brand.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well
they
had
a
--
sonny
boy,
your
honor
up
in
the
northwest
and
then
their
utah
brand
here,
this
brand.
this
--
this
is
an
eight-inch,
24-ounce
pie,
a
quality
pie
which
is
directly
competitive
with
the
pet-ritz,
with
the
bel-air,
and
with
carnation,
directly
competitive.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well,
that
was
a
private
labeled
manufactured
by
utah
for
associated
groceries.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well,
this
is
one
of
them,
frost
'n
flame,
and
the
sonny
boy
was
another
one
and
may
fresh
was
another
one.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
as
far
as
the
utah
pie
company
was
concerned.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
talking
about
the
whole
line.
talking
about
their
whole
line,
as
far
as
our
situation
is
concerned
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
correct.
well
three,
swiss
miss,
bel-air
and
pet-ritz.
we
sold
this
to
the
private
labeled
safeway,
bel-air.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
no.
bel-air
is
the
exactly
comparable
to
pet-ritz.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
it's
an
eight-inch,
24-ounce
quality
pie.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
made
--
made
to
the
specifications
of
the
safeway.
that
i
might
say
here
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
utah
was
24-ounce,
swiss
miss
was
20-ounce.
and
--
and
swiss
miss
was
not
the
same
quality
either,
it
had
less
fruits.
and
it
was
a
--
it
was
definitely
an
economy
pie
and
was
priced
low
for
the
economy
market.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
when
you
factor
those
out
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
--
it
goes
up
here.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
it's
just
like
saying
whether
or
not
you
know
the
difference
between
a
cadillac
and
a
chevrolet.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
i
think
--
i
think
you
have
to.
i
think
--
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
injury
proving
the
competition
or
an
injury
to
the
competitor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
well,
i
think
that's
an
important
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
not
--
not
always
true.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
for
a
few
moments
to
the
predatory
tactics
referred
to
by
mr.
alioto.
first
of
all,
for
a
guy
who
did
a
visit
to
the
utah
pie
company
and
we
certainly
don't
condone
that
was
a
highly
unfortunate
thing,
it
was
an
isolated
instance,
it
was
only
done
once,
has
no
comparison
with
a
long
planned
efforts
that
were
made
in
standard
oil,
american
tobacco,
and
so
forth.
it
was
certainly
then
advised
and
the
young
man
who
did
it
was
severely
chastised
for
it.
if
you
read
our
footnote
8
on
page
59,
i
put
the
whole
report
in
my
brief
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
doubt
about
what
he
said.
it's
complimentary
whether
than
anything
else.
it
was
--
it
was
never
used
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
young,
the
chief
buyer
for
safeway,
according
to
mr.
deitman,
the
chief
contract
officer
for
pet,
it
was
never
used
in
any
respect
to
--
to
dan
--
endanger
the
utah
pie
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
this
question
to
safeway
sales
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
that
was
the
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine,
yes
your
honor.
it
was.
i
do
think
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
--
in
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
i
think
that
such
as
in
the
--
in
the
general
electric
case
there
is
some
discussion
of
this
type
of
--
of
strong
competition
and
i
think
your
honor
that
this
is
certainly
wasn't
an
unfortunate
incident.
it
was
only
one
incident,
it
was
isolated
and
i
think
it's
been
blown
of
all
out
of
proportions
in
this
case.
but
nevertheless,
under
matters
of
circumstances
most
companies
that
gives
exchange
visits
back
and
forth
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
yes
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
george
p.
lamb
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
true,
that
it
could
have
impressed
the
jury.
well,
i
brought
mr.
shank,
the
man
who
did
it.
i
put
him
on
as
my
witness
and
gave
mr.
alioto
full
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him
and
introduce
the
whole
thing
in
evidence,
so
it
was
clear
open
book.
i
told
the
jury
precisely
what
happened,
what
an
unfortunate
thing
it
was.
i
think
actually
if
the
two
companies
that
said
let's
exchange
visits
to
our
respective
plants
that
would
have
been
done
that
way.
because
that's
more
modern
and
it
is
something
that
i
think
it's
going
to
be
blown
out
of
proportion.
now,
on
its
investment
spending
that
mr.
alioto
speaks
to,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
i
think
that
this
is
partially
what's
done
in
introducing
new
products
in
the
market.
there
has
to
be
research
and
development
cost,
there
has
to
be
promotion
cost,
and
so
on.
the
swiss
miss
brand
was
not
a
fighting
ship.
the
swiss
miss
brand
was
an
attempt
to
meet
a
demand
in
--
in
the
marketplace.
now,
your
honors,
in
summary,
in
so
far
as
the
procedural
question
is
concerned.
i'd
like
to
say
this
that
mr.
alioto
lost
on
the
conspiracy
count
below.
he
was
asking
for
$750,000
from
pet
treble
and
he
got
$44,000
treble.
mr.
alioto
is
one
of
the
most
skillful
line
cost
lawyers
in
the
country.
now,
his
--
his
utah
pie
company
was
very
ably
represented
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
judge
sustained
him
a
187
times
and
sustained
the
defendants
in
this
case
15
times.
that
the
--
mr.
--
mr.
alioto
if
--
if
he
had
any
idea
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
needed
a
new
trial
on
this
conspiracy
count,
he
would
have
made
a
motion
to
that
effect.
he
did
not
do
that
because
of
the
disparity
in
the
--
in
the
verdict,
the
$750,000
versus
$44,000.
i'm
sure
if
he
had
thought
he
had
grounds
a
new
trial,
he
would
have
made
it
and
then
he
had
another
chance
to
make
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
didn't
make
any
motion
for
a
new
trial
there.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
2106
has
the
power
as
this
court
does
and
we
do
not
think
that
if
litigation
is
going
to
be
ultimately
ended
that
rule
50
(d)
has
to
be
construed
by
this
court
or
it
has
to
be
amended,
changed
and
clarified
in
order
to
make
sure
that
litigation
stops
some
place
and
we
think
under
the
circumstances
in
that
respect
that
as
far
as
the
procedural
question
is
concerned
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
right
to
do
what
they
did
and
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
entered
for
--
for
the
pet
milk
company
as
--
as
directed
by
the
tenth
circuit.
now,
we
think
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
that
the
court
can
conclude
that
certiorari
in
the
pet
case
was
improperly
granted
and
can
reverse
itself
on
certiorari
and
allow
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
to
stand.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
