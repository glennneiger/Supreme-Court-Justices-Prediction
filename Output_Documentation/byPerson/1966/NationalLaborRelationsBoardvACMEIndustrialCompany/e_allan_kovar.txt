mr.
e.
allan
kovar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
rather
intrigued
with
the
theory
advanced
counsel
for
the
board
which
apparently
sounded
something
like
what's
good
for
general
motors
is
good
for
the
nation.
i
had
assumed
that
that
theory
had
been
made
unpopular
some
years
back.
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
evidence
alluded
to
in
respect
to
general
motors
being
first
brought
forth
in
the
interveners
brief
in
this
matter
is
totally
irrelevant
and
inapplicable
to
the
case
here
involved.
what
is
here
involved
is
a
small
employer
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
tools
and
metal
products
in
the
city
of
chicago.
what
is
here
involved
is
that
somewhere
for
example
between
1954
and
1956,
this
employer
last
used
a
chucker
machine.
it
was
eight
to
ten
years
before
the
grievances
been
filed
that
we're
involved
herein
that
the
member
of
the
union
last
used
this
piece
of
equipment.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
a
chucker
machine.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
c-h-u-c-k-e-r,
i
believe.
in
1964,
the
company
removed
this
chucker
from
its
plant.
eight
to
ten
years
after
it
was
last
used
by
a
member
of
this
union.
the
union
of
course
knew
that
the
chucker
was
removed.
this
was
not
general
motors.
this
was
acme
industrial
where
a
little
more
than
a
100
employees
were
involved.
and
the
movement,
the
removal
of
this
piece
of
equipment
last
used
eight
to
ten
years
prior
was
noticed
by
union
officials
and
a
grievance
was
filed.
one
month
later,
the
union
with
regard
of
this
chucker
as
well
as
several
other
pieces
of
equipment
wrote
the
company
asking
for
the
date
it
was
removed,
the
location
to
which
it
was
removed,
the
purpose
of
the
removal
and
whether
it
was
used
for
production
elsewhere.
the
case
that
we
are
dealing
here
amongst
other
pieces
of
equipment
dealt
with
these
questions
with
respect
to
a
piece
of
equipment
last
used
eight
to
ten
years
prior
thereto.
a
company
demurred
to
that
request
of
information.
and
now
close
to
three
years
later,
we
are
here
arguing
whether
or
not
this
employer
violated
the
federal
labor
law
by
refusing
to
tell
the
union
where,
when
and
why
a
piece
of
equipment
was
removed,
a
piece
of
equipment
last
used
ten
to
12
years
ago.
with
all
due
deference,
i
would
note
as
applicable
hereto
(inaudible)
thought
that
absurdity
is
the
privilege
of
no
living
creature
but
man
only.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
i
think
as
this
court
stated
in
the
truitt
case
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
quote,
"the
inquiry
must
always
be
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
the
statutory
objective
to
bargain
in
good
faith
has
been
met
so
that
what
applies
in
the
general
motor
situation
may
or
may
not
apply
in
the
acme
industrial
situation."
and
the
study
--
and
each
case
must
be
as
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
whether
the
statutory
obligation
the
bargain
has
been
met.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
poses
and
impossible
situation
while
the
treasurer
of
acme
industrial
would
no
doubt
enjoy
status
of
being
equal
to
general
motors
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
general
motors
cannot
be
acme
industrial.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
under
the
same
circumstances,
exactly
yes.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
but
there
cannot
be
the
same
circumstances
of
course
because
the
two
companies
are
so
totally
dissimilar
in
size
if
nothing
else
that
one
would
have
to
look
in
to
the
relationship
with
the
parties.
one
would
have
to
look
into
the
knowledge
under
the
facts
concerns
as
to
whether
this
information
was
relevant
to
the
union's
bargaining
position.
i
think
by
looking
at
the
questions
here
involved
and
looking
at
them
with
respect
to
this
particular
piece
of
equipment,
we
can
reveal
quite
clearly
i
believe
the
total
irrelevance
of
the
information
requested.
and
the
fact
that
that
irrelevance
was
known
by
the
company,
the
fact
that
the
company
knew
that
the
union
had
all
the
information
it
needed
to
know
whether
there
was
any
valid
grievance
or
not.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
no,
sir.
there
were
number
of
pieces
of
equipment.
one
of
them
had
been
used
two
to
three
years
prior
thereto
which
was
before
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved
had
been
executed.
another
had
not
been
used
during
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
another
had
been
--
two
pieces
had
been
removed
but
they
have
been
replaced
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
grievances.
another
had
been
used
by
employees
in
another
classification
although
that
work
was
still
being
done.
another
equipment,
grinding
and
slotting
type
of
work
can
be
done
on
several
different
pieces
of
equipment.
in
any
case,
not
one
piece
of
equipment
which
is
removed
resulted
in
the
downgrading
or
layoff
of
a
single
employee
and
the
union
knew
that.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
sir.
the
company
wrote,
replied
to
the
union
saying
that
as
it
understood
the
request
for
information,
it
related
to
article
vi,
section
10
of
the
contract
which
provision
as
counsel
for
the
labor
board
has
indicated
to
you,
related
to
the
transfer
of
equipment
from
the
plant.
the
company
said
in
his
letter,
we
understand
this
request
for
information
relates
to
that
provision
and
that
provision
cannot
be
involved
with
the
removal
of
equipment
because
as
you
very
well
know,
no
employee
has
been
laid
off
or
downgraded.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
fortas
because
the
record
shows
that
the
union
was
aware,
had
the
informations
supplied
to
it
by
the
company
as
to
whether
any
employee
had
been
laid
off
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
and
as
to
whether
any
employee
had
been
downgraded
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
and
the
record
attempted
to
show
that
the
union
knew
this
fact.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
the
union
already
knew
the
name
of
the
piece
of
equipment
be
--
the
request
as
for
that
so
the
company
could
not
tell
it,
what
it
already
knew
there.
the
union
already
knew
the
date
that
the
piece
of
equipment
had
been
removed
so
the
company
could
not
tell
it
when
it
--
need
not
tell
it
when
it
have
been
removed.
the
company
did
not
engage
in
useless
acts.
it
did
not
give
the
union
information
which
they'd
already
had.
the
additional
union
information
which
the
company
did
not
give
the
union
and
the
reason
why
we're
here
was
that
information
which
the
company
felt
to
be
totally
irrelevant
to
the
administration
of
the
contract
in
which
the
company
told
the
union
it
did
not
need
because
it
had
sufficient
information
to
administer
the
contract
under
its
terms.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
the
motivation
of
the
company
is
indicated
in
the
record
and
i
can
surmise
a
number
of
reasons.
but
let
me
suggest
this
that
where
a
union
asked
for
information
concerning
the
removal
of
a
piece
of
equipment
last
used
eight
to
ten
years
before
the
request,
the
company
might
well
surmise
that
the
information
request
was
nothing
but
an
attempt
to
get
before
the
labor
board.
as
the
company
indicated
in
its
letter
to
the
union
that
what
it
felt,
the
company
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
black
we
did
that.
and
the
letter
so
indicates
which
is
in
the
record
to
this
day.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
it's
a
secret
to
me
where
the
relevance
can
be
found
through
the
information
requested.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
oh,
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
secret.
i
don't
know
that
the
matter
however
is
one
of
this
record.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
can
do
so
although
the
matter
is
not
a
matter
of
record
before
this
court.
the
reason
that
the
company
refused
to
give
this
information
was
that
knowing
very
well
that
the
union
had
all
the
information
it
wanted
and
knowing
that
the
union
was
requesting
by
way
of
its
grievances
the
right
to
bargain
concerning
the
removal
of
any
equipment
as
is
indicated
in
the
record
as
is
written
in
some
of
the
--
specifically
in
some
of
the
grievances
at
the
union
filed.
the
company
having
already
bargained
that
matter
decided
that
bargaining
was
through
for
the
term
of
the
contract
and
it
was
not
going
to
continue
bargaining
with
the
union
concerning
that
matter.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct.
the
question
here
involved
is
whether
the
employer
is
in
violation
of
the
law.
the
question
is
not
whether
it
would
hurt
the
employer
to
give
this
information.
now
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
that
giving
the
union
information
concerning
where
equipment
might
go
might
well
give
the
union
an
opportunity
to
attempt
to
follow
whether
it
had
any
contractual
right
to
do
so
and
engage
the
employer
in
an
organizational
campaign
elsewhere.
i
don't
believe
that
the
employer
is
obligated
under
any
provision
of
the
law
to
supply
the
union
with
such
information.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
there
are
a
number
of
potential
answers
i
presume
which
the
employer
might
have
given
the
union
which
would
have
not
injured
the
union.
the
question
here
involved
is
whether
the
employer
violated
its
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
by
refusing
to
give
the
information
which
it
knew
very
well
was
totally
irrelevant
to
the
union
bargaining
function.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
not
at
all
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
open
the
door
to
any
request
for
information
must
therefore
be
given.
there
has
been
no
suspicion
thus
far
that
the
request
for
information
must
be
accorded
that
type
of
recognition.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
as
to
that
is
that
with
respect
to
one
grievance,
the
union
president
and
vice
president
said
that
they
knew
where
the
piece
of
equipment
was
going
and
why
it
was
going.
this
was
the
only
time
that
they
raised
the
issue
in
any
of
the
upper
level
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure.
the
record
still
shows
that.
the
record
also
shows
that
that
union
president
and
vice
president
were
present
at
the
hearing
and
there
was
never
any
denial
of
that
fact.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
i
would
think
so.
i
think
i
would
refer
you
to
the
statement
of
the
national
academy
of
arbitrators
who
indicated
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
their
statement
of
what
i'm
going
to
say
might
add
some
substance
to
it.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
mr.
chief
justice,
is
--
as
to
how
the
union
might
get
necessary
relevant
information
under
the
grievance
procedure
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
arbitrators,
the
professional
arbitrators
who
have
been
interpreting
and
handling
grievances
for
a
number
of
years
know
very
well
that
when
information
is
solely
in
the
hands
of
a
company
that
the
burden
falls
upon
the
company.
and
the
company's
refusal
to
give
such
information
would
lead
to
a
decision
contrary
to
the
company's
interest.
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
a
litigious
situation,
a
single
situation
of
adversary
litigation.
we
are
dealing
with
a
continuing
relationship
between
the
parties.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
as
we
go
back
to
the
case
at
hand,
the
union
knew
that
the
piece
of
equipment
involved
hadn't
been
used
for
ten
years.
the
union
knew
that
the
no
employee
had
been
laid
off
or
downgraded
as
a
result
of
the
removal
of
that
equipment.
the
union
knew
that
there
are
only
two
clauses
potentially
available
to
it.
one,
which
said
not
that
the
company
agreed
not
to
subcontract
but
would
said
if
you
will
note
that
it
was
a
company's
policy
not
to
subcontract
or
if
normally
performed
by
bargaining
union
employees.
now
if
anyone
can
possibly
say
that
a
machine
which
had
not
been
used
for
eight
to
ten
years
could
be
involved
with
work
normally
performed
by
bargaining
union
employees,
i
need
that
type
explanation
because
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
it
in
the
three
years
of
litigation
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
was
--
certainly
they
were
and
one
of
those
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
because
the
board
mad
no
distinction.
the
board's
rule
would
apply
to
that
piece
of
equipment
as
well
as
the
others
and
knowing
that
the
information
requested
was
for
all
of
those
pieces,
it
became
apparent
to
the
employer
what
was
being
sought
and
i
think
it
is
apparent
now
or
should
be
apparent
now
what
the
board
is
seeking.
that
any
information
related
no
matter
how
tenuously
related
to
a
contract
provision
it
must
be
the
information
concerning
it
must
be
given
to
the
union.
if
you
recall,
i
think
that
this
court
said
that
any
matter
which
is
claimed
to
be
a
contract
violation
is
arbitrable.
and
if
the
term
grievable
is
identical
to
arbitrable
as
it
seems
to
me
it
must
be
that
any
matter
which
the
union
claims
to
be
a
violation
to
contract
is
grievable
is
arbitrable
whether
it
would
be
a
meritorious
claim
or
not.
now,
it
seems
to
me
then
what
this
board
is
saying
that
any
information
which
may
be
related
somehow
to
a
claim
which
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
contract
must
be
given.
and
i
see
nothing
in
section
8
(a)
(5).
i
see
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
amended
which
would
open
to
the
union
the
doors
of
the
employer's
file
for
any
and/or
request
of
information
that
it
might
seek.
it
seems
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
when
we
get
to
the
second
point
which
is
a
legal
point,
yes
it
would
be.
i
think
the
absurdity
of
the
case
however
is
revealed
by
the
kind
of
factual
situation
were
dealing
with
here.
our
second
point
is
that
any
information
which
is
related
to
the
contract
which
is
dependent
for
its
relevance
upon
the
contract
should
not
be
the
subject
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation.
that
what
the
parties
bargained
for
was
the
administration
and
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
according
to
the
terms
that
they
set
forth
and
whether
or
not
those
terms
provided
for
arbitration.
they've
--
they
determined
a
method
by
which
the
parties
would
settle
their
disputes
during
the
term
of
their
contract
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--
whether
it
be
by
way
of
the
301
or
arbitration.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
under
the
force
the
national
labor
relations
act,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
is
the
essence
of
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
first
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
not,
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
the
legal
proposition
would
determine
this
case,
yes.
but
i
think
even
if
that
legal
issue
were
determined
against
us,
it
still
would
be
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
employer
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
that
factual
determination
goes
beyond.
i
think
the
legal
principle
as
to
the
union
or
the
board's
power
here
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
after
this
company
has
been
in
litigation
for
almost
three
years
i
would
certainly
hope
that
that
would
not
be
the
result
of
this
court's
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
that
the
record
will
clearly
show
that
this
employer
attempted
in
every
way
it
could
in
the
hearing
before
the
trial
examiner
to
get
all
the
information
concerning
the
relevance
or
more
accurately
the
irrelevance
of
the
information
requested.
and
that
the
general
counsel
upon
whom
the
burden
of
proof
falls
in
any
unfair
labor
practice
refused
to
consider
that
aspect
and
said
no
such
allegations
were
being
made.
to
now
attempt
to
put
this
employer
in
the
position
of
going
back
what
it
attempted
to
do
three
years
ago
would
seem
to
me
would
be
a
most
unjust
result.
i
would
think
that
in
this
particular
situation,
the
only
thing
that
is
really
happen
in,
say
the
last
20
to
21
years
of
the
federal
labor
legislation
is
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
no
uncertain
terms
the
desirability
of
parties'
private
problem
determination
and
has
indicated
therefore
example
that
arbitration
is
the
process
which
the
party
should
engage
in.
that
--
this
court
also
indicated
in
the
trilogy
cases
as
i
recall
it
that
under
the
guise
of
determining
arbitrability,
the
courts
may
not
determine
the
merits
of
a
particular
grievance.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
labor
board
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
that
under
the
guise
of
determining
relevance
it
is
in
fact
issuing
a
judgment
as
to
how
valid
or
how
invalid
a
grievance
is.
if
it
is
not
doing
that,
if
the
labor
board
is
not
doing
that
and
if
it
is
only
saying
that
any
request
for
information
related
to
a
contract
provision
must
be
given
then
i
think
that
the
labor
board
is
throwing
out
the
test
of
relevance
for
information
is
saying
to
you
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
any
request
for
information
which
may
be
related
to
a
contract
must
be
given.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
request
--
that
that
type
of
position
has
no
foundation
in
the
law
and
runs
contrary
to
the
type
of
relationship
which
the
law
has
attempted
to
establish
between
union
and
employer.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
believe
that
section
10
(a)
relates
to
the
board's
power
to
determine
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
threshold
question
is
to
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
can
be
found
to
exist
where
the
basis
of
the
claim
rest
within
the
four
corners
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
initial
threshold
question
must
first
to
be
determined
before
section
10
(a)
has
any
application
whatsoever.
now
if
for
example
under
section
8
(d)
(4)
where
the
definition
of
collective
bargaining
is
given,
if
one
were
to
presume
that
a
union
claim
for
an
amendment
of
a
contract
were
involved.
it
might
be
settled,
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
their
refusal
to
bargain
under
the
definition
to
8
(d)(4).
if
the
union
were
to
claim
that
it
was
not
attempting
to
amend
the
contract
but
under
the
contract
in
fact
had
the
right
to
make
the
claim
it
was
making
then
you
would
come
to
the
question
of
the
balance
it
seems
to
me
between
the
board's
authority
and
the
authority
of
the
parties
to
determine
their
own
private
method
of
solution.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
and
i
would
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes.
yes,
indeed
it
is
but
the
question
is
as
to
whether
that
power
exists.
whether
the
power
exist
to
determine
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
involved
where
the
issue
is
one
of
contract
interpretation.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
saying
the
10
(a)
applies
we
assume
a
way
the
real
issue.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
would
think
that
in
the
event
of
a
discharge
of
an
employee
that
the
union
claim
to
be
a
violation
of
section
7
and
8
(a)
(3)
that
this
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
to
which
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
claim
information
without
any
regard
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
whatsoever.
i
think
in
fact,
the
position
that
we
take
is
that
where
information
is
relevant
to
the
bargaining
function
without
relation
to
the
existence
of
the
bargaining
agreement
that
information
falls
under
the
general
rules
which
have
applied
and
that
were
relevant
to
the
function
and
were
needed
and
where
there
aren't
affirmative
defenses
available
then
it
would
have
to
be
given.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
not
necessarily
i
think
of
course
that
any
union
claim
which
claims
a
violation
of
contract
constitutes
a
grievance.
i
think
that
if
there
were
no
employees
affected
thereby,
that
the
employer
would
not
have
to
give
information.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
for
example,
this
court
might
take
judicial
notice
when
an
employer
is
out
on
a
strike,
the
customers
can
be
lost.
and
the
record
does
not
show
as
counsel
for
the
labor
board
would
indicate
that
employees
were
laid
off
at
the
commencement
of
this
contract
as
an
affirmative
act.
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
--
in
fact
those
employees
were
not
called
back
to
work
after
the
strike
because
of
the
lost
of
the
work.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
so.
for
example,
8
(a)
(1)
interference,
8
(a)
(2)
domination,
8
(a)
(3)
discrimination,
8
(a)
(4)
interfering
with
the
testimony
or
witnesses
to
a
board
proceeding
are
particular
prohibitions
of
the
act
which
whether
or
not
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
nevertheless
be
cognizable
by
the
labor
board.
the
board
would
retain
its
power
whether
or
not
the
contract
has
anything
to
do
with
that.
but
8
(a)
(5)
deals
with
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
8
(a)
(5)
it
seems
to
me
must
involve
two
types
of
bargaining.
one,
pre-contract
bargaining
and
two,
post-contract
bargaining
and
it
is
our
contention
that
post-contract
bargaining
is
not
the
same
as
pre-contract
bargaining
that
the
parties
do
have
the
right
to
channel
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
them
during
the
term
of
that
agreement.
that
that
parties
do
have
a
right
to
determine
both
the
substance
as
well
as
the
procedure
of
collective
bargaining
during
the
terms
of
that
agreement.
and
if
this
not
be
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
in
this
and
in
the
companion
case
is
to
declare
that
an
employer
may
not
act
unilaterally
even
during
the
term
of
the
contract
unless
that
contract
specifically
allows
it
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
this
board
is
attempting
to
instill
in
the
labor
management
relationship
picture
in
this
country
is
the
idea
that
an
employer
may
not
act
unilaterally
without
prior
union
approval.
and
if
that
be
the
case
then
i
say
that
the
american
industrial
set
up
is
in
dire
jeopardy.
this
is
not
a
totally
unimportant
case
involving
just
a
hundred
employees
to
the
extent
that
that
issue
is
involved.
it
involves
all
of
american
industry.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
rather
intrigued
with
the
theory
advanced
counsel
for
the
board
which
apparently
sounded
something
like
what's
good
for
general
motors
is
good
for
the
nation.
i
had
assumed
that
that
theory
had
been
made
unpopular
some
years
back.
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
evidence
alluded
to
in
respect
to
general
motors
being
first
brought
forth
in
the
interveners
brief
in
this
matter
is
totally
irrelevant
and
inapplicable
to
the
case
here
involved.
what
is
here
involved
is
a
small
employer
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
tools
and
metal
products
in
the
city
of
chicago.
what
is
here
involved
is
that
somewhere
for
example
between
1954
and
1956,
this
employer
last
used
a
chucker
machine.
it
was
eight
to
ten
years
before
the
grievances
been
filed
that
we're
involved
herein
that
the
member
of
the
union
last
used
this
piece
of
equipment.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
a
chucker
machine.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
c-h-u-c-k-e-r,
i
believe.
in
1964,
the
company
removed
this
chucker
from
its
plant.
eight
to
ten
years
after
it
was
last
used
by
a
member
of
this
union.
the
union
of
course
knew
that
the
chucker
was
removed.
this
was
not
general
motors.
this
was
acme
industrial
where
a
little
more
than
a
100
employees
were
involved.
and
the
movement,
the
removal
of
this
piece
of
equipment
last
used
eight
to
ten
years
prior
was
noticed
by
union
officials
and
a
grievance
was
filed.
one
month
later,
the
union
with
regard
of
this
chucker
as
well
as
several
other
pieces
of
equipment
wrote
the
company
asking
for
the
date
it
was
removed,
the
location
to
which
it
was
removed,
the
purpose
of
the
removal
and
whether
it
was
used
for
production
elsewhere.
the
case
that
we
are
dealing
here
amongst
other
pieces
of
equipment
dealt
with
these
questions
with
respect
to
a
piece
of
equipment
last
used
eight
to
ten
years
prior
thereto.
a
company
demurred
to
that
request
of
information.
and
now
close
to
three
years
later,
we
are
here
arguing
whether
or
not
this
employer
violated
the
federal
labor
law
by
refusing
to
tell
the
union
where,
when
and
why
a
piece
of
equipment
was
removed,
a
piece
of
equipment
last
used
ten
to
12
years
ago.
with
all
due
deference,
i
would
note
as
applicable
hereto
(inaudible)
thought
that
absurdity
is
the
privilege
of
no
living
creature
but
man
only.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
i
think
as
this
court
stated
in
the
truitt
case
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
quote,
"the
inquiry
must
always
be
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
the
statutory
objective
to
bargain
in
good
faith
has
been
met
so
that
what
applies
in
the
general
motor
situation
may
or
may
not
apply
in
the
acme
industrial
situation."
and
the
study
--
and
each
case
must
be
as
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
whether
the
statutory
obligation
the
bargain
has
been
met.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
poses
and
impossible
situation
while
the
treasurer
of
acme
industrial
would
no
doubt
enjoy
status
of
being
equal
to
general
motors
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
general
motors
cannot
be
acme
industrial.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
under
the
same
circumstances,
exactly
yes.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
but
there
cannot
be
the
same
circumstances
of
course
because
the
two
companies
are
so
totally
dissimilar
in
size
if
nothing
else
that
one
would
have
to
look
in
to
the
relationship
with
the
parties.
one
would
have
to
look
into
the
knowledge
under
the
facts
concerns
as
to
whether
this
information
was
relevant
to
the
union's
bargaining
position.
i
think
by
looking
at
the
questions
here
involved
and
looking
at
them
with
respect
to
this
particular
piece
of
equipment,
we
can
reveal
quite
clearly
i
believe
the
total
irrelevance
of
the
information
requested.
and
the
fact
that
that
irrelevance
was
known
by
the
company,
the
fact
that
the
company
knew
that
the
union
had
all
the
information
it
needed
to
know
whether
there
was
any
valid
grievance
or
not.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
no,
sir.
there
were
number
of
pieces
of
equipment.
one
of
them
had
been
used
two
to
three
years
prior
thereto
which
was
before
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved
had
been
executed.
another
had
not
been
used
during
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
another
had
been
--
two
pieces
had
been
removed
but
they
have
been
replaced
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
grievances.
another
had
been
used
by
employees
in
another
classification
although
that
work
was
still
being
done.
another
equipment,
grinding
and
slotting
type
of
work
can
be
done
on
several
different
pieces
of
equipment.
in
any
case,
not
one
piece
of
equipment
which
is
removed
resulted
in
the
downgrading
or
layoff
of
a
single
employee
and
the
union
knew
that.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
sir.
the
company
wrote,
replied
to
the
union
saying
that
as
it
understood
the
request
for
information,
it
related
to
article
vi,
section
10
of
the
contract
which
provision
as
counsel
for
the
labor
board
has
indicated
to
you,
related
to
the
transfer
of
equipment
from
the
plant.
the
company
said
in
his
letter,
we
understand
this
request
for
information
relates
to
that
provision
and
that
provision
cannot
be
involved
with
the
removal
of
equipment
because
as
you
very
well
know,
no
employee
has
been
laid
off
or
downgraded.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
fortas
because
the
record
shows
that
the
union
was
aware,
had
the
informations
supplied
to
it
by
the
company
as
to
whether
any
employee
had
been
laid
off
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
and
as
to
whether
any
employee
had
been
downgraded
during
the
term
of
the
agreement.
and
the
record
attempted
to
show
that
the
union
knew
this
fact.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
the
union
already
knew
the
name
of
the
piece
of
equipment
be
--
the
request
as
for
that
so
the
company
could
not
tell
it,
what
it
already
knew
there.
the
union
already
knew
the
date
that
the
piece
of
equipment
had
been
removed
so
the
company
could
not
tell
it
when
it
--
need
not
tell
it
when
it
have
been
removed.
the
company
did
not
engage
in
useless
acts.
it
did
not
give
the
union
information
which
they'd
already
had.
the
additional
union
information
which
the
company
did
not
give
the
union
and
the
reason
why
we're
here
was
that
information
which
the
company
felt
to
be
totally
irrelevant
to
the
administration
of
the
contract
in
which
the
company
told
the
union
it
did
not
need
because
it
had
sufficient
information
to
administer
the
contract
under
its
terms.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
the
motivation
of
the
company
is
indicated
in
the
record
and
i
can
surmise
a
number
of
reasons.
but
let
me
suggest
this
that
where
a
union
asked
for
information
concerning
the
removal
of
a
piece
of
equipment
last
used
eight
to
ten
years
before
the
request,
the
company
might
well
surmise
that
the
information
request
was
nothing
but
an
attempt
to
get
before
the
labor
board.
as
the
company
indicated
in
its
letter
to
the
union
that
what
it
felt,
the
company
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
black
we
did
that.
and
the
letter
so
indicates
which
is
in
the
record
to
this
day.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
it's
a
secret
to
me
where
the
relevance
can
be
found
through
the
information
requested.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
oh,
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
secret.
i
don't
know
that
the
matter
however
is
one
of
this
record.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
can
do
so
although
the
matter
is
not
a
matter
of
record
before
this
court.
the
reason
that
the
company
refused
to
give
this
information
was
that
knowing
very
well
that
the
union
had
all
the
information
it
wanted
and
knowing
that
the
union
was
requesting
by
way
of
its
grievances
the
right
to
bargain
concerning
the
removal
of
any
equipment
as
is
indicated
in
the
record
as
is
written
in
some
of
the
--
specifically
in
some
of
the
grievances
at
the
union
filed.
the
company
having
already
bargained
that
matter
decided
that
bargaining
was
through
for
the
term
of
the
contract
and
it
was
not
going
to
continue
bargaining
with
the
union
concerning
that
matter.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct.
the
question
here
involved
is
whether
the
employer
is
in
violation
of
the
law.
the
question
is
not
whether
it
would
hurt
the
employer
to
give
this
information.
now
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
that
giving
the
union
information
concerning
where
equipment
might
go
might
well
give
the
union
an
opportunity
to
attempt
to
follow
whether
it
had
any
contractual
right
to
do
so
and
engage
the
employer
in
an
organizational
campaign
elsewhere.
i
don't
believe
that
the
employer
is
obligated
under
any
provision
of
the
law
to
supply
the
union
with
such
information.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
there
are
a
number
of
potential
answers
i
presume
which
the
employer
might
have
given
the
union
which
would
have
not
injured
the
union.
the
question
here
involved
is
whether
the
employer
violated
its
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
by
refusing
to
give
the
information
which
it
knew
very
well
was
totally
irrelevant
to
the
union
bargaining
function.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
not
at
all
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
open
the
door
to
any
request
for
information
must
therefore
be
given.
there
has
been
no
suspicion
thus
far
that
the
request
for
information
must
be
accorded
that
type
of
recognition.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
as
to
that
is
that
with
respect
to
one
grievance,
the
union
president
and
vice
president
said
that
they
knew
where
the
piece
of
equipment
was
going
and
why
it
was
going.
this
was
the
only
time
that
they
raised
the
issue
in
any
of
the
upper
level
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure.
the
record
still
shows
that.
the
record
also
shows
that
that
union
president
and
vice
president
were
present
at
the
hearing
and
there
was
never
any
denial
of
that
fact.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
i
would
think
so.
i
think
i
would
refer
you
to
the
statement
of
the
national
academy
of
arbitrators
who
indicated
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
their
statement
of
what
i'm
going
to
say
might
add
some
substance
to
it.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
mr.
chief
justice,
is
--
as
to
how
the
union
might
get
necessary
relevant
information
under
the
grievance
procedure
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
arbitrators,
the
professional
arbitrators
who
have
been
interpreting
and
handling
grievances
for
a
number
of
years
know
very
well
that
when
information
is
solely
in
the
hands
of
a
company
that
the
burden
falls
upon
the
company.
and
the
company's
refusal
to
give
such
information
would
lead
to
a
decision
contrary
to
the
company's
interest.
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
a
litigious
situation,
a
single
situation
of
adversary
litigation.
we
are
dealing
with
a
continuing
relationship
between
the
parties.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
as
we
go
back
to
the
case
at
hand,
the
union
knew
that
the
piece
of
equipment
involved
hadn't
been
used
for
ten
years.
the
union
knew
that
the
no
employee
had
been
laid
off
or
downgraded
as
a
result
of
the
removal
of
that
equipment.
the
union
knew
that
there
are
only
two
clauses
potentially
available
to
it.
one,
which
said
not
that
the
company
agreed
not
to
subcontract
but
would
said
if
you
will
note
that
it
was
a
company's
policy
not
to
subcontract
or
if
normally
performed
by
bargaining
union
employees.
now
if
anyone
can
possibly
say
that
a
machine
which
had
not
been
used
for
eight
to
ten
years
could
be
involved
with
work
normally
performed
by
bargaining
union
employees,
i
need
that
type
explanation
because
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
it
in
the
three
years
of
litigation
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
was
--
certainly
they
were
and
one
of
those
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
because
the
board
mad
no
distinction.
the
board's
rule
would
apply
to
that
piece
of
equipment
as
well
as
the
others
and
knowing
that
the
information
requested
was
for
all
of
those
pieces,
it
became
apparent
to
the
employer
what
was
being
sought
and
i
think
it
is
apparent
now
or
should
be
apparent
now
what
the
board
is
seeking.
that
any
information
related
no
matter
how
tenuously
related
to
a
contract
provision
it
must
be
the
information
concerning
it
must
be
given
to
the
union.
if
you
recall,
i
think
that
this
court
said
that
any
matter
which
is
claimed
to
be
a
contract
violation
is
arbitrable.
and
if
the
term
grievable
is
identical
to
arbitrable
as
it
seems
to
me
it
must
be
that
any
matter
which
the
union
claims
to
be
a
violation
to
contract
is
grievable
is
arbitrable
whether
it
would
be
a
meritorious
claim
or
not.
now,
it
seems
to
me
then
what
this
board
is
saying
that
any
information
which
may
be
related
somehow
to
a
claim
which
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
contract
must
be
given.
and
i
see
nothing
in
section
8
(a)
(5).
i
see
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
amended
which
would
open
to
the
union
the
doors
of
the
employer's
file
for
any
and/or
request
of
information
that
it
might
seek.
it
seems
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
when
we
get
to
the
second
point
which
is
a
legal
point,
yes
it
would
be.
i
think
the
absurdity
of
the
case
however
is
revealed
by
the
kind
of
factual
situation
were
dealing
with
here.
our
second
point
is
that
any
information
which
is
related
to
the
contract
which
is
dependent
for
its
relevance
upon
the
contract
should
not
be
the
subject
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation.
that
what
the
parties
bargained
for
was
the
administration
and
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
according
to
the
terms
that
they
set
forth
and
whether
or
not
those
terms
provided
for
arbitration.
they've
--
they
determined
a
method
by
which
the
parties
would
settle
their
disputes
during
the
term
of
their
contract
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--
whether
it
be
by
way
of
the
301
or
arbitration.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
under
the
force
the
national
labor
relations
act,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
is
the
essence
of
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
first
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
not,
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i
think
that
the
legal
proposition
would
determine
this
case,
yes.
but
i
think
even
if
that
legal
issue
were
determined
against
us,
it
still
would
be
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
employer
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
that
factual
determination
goes
beyond.
i
think
the
legal
principle
as
to
the
union
or
the
board's
power
here
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well,
after
this
company
has
been
in
litigation
for
almost
three
years
i
would
certainly
hope
that
that
would
not
be
the
result
of
this
court's
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
that
the
record
will
clearly
show
that
this
employer
attempted
in
every
way
it
could
in
the
hearing
before
the
trial
examiner
to
get
all
the
information
concerning
the
relevance
or
more
accurately
the
irrelevance
of
the
information
requested.
and
that
the
general
counsel
upon
whom
the
burden
of
proof
falls
in
any
unfair
labor
practice
refused
to
consider
that
aspect
and
said
no
such
allegations
were
being
made.
to
now
attempt
to
put
this
employer
in
the
position
of
going
back
what
it
attempted
to
do
three
years
ago
would
seem
to
me
would
be
a
most
unjust
result.
i
would
think
that
in
this
particular
situation,
the
only
thing
that
is
really
happen
in,
say
the
last
20
to
21
years
of
the
federal
labor
legislation
is
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
no
uncertain
terms
the
desirability
of
parties'
private
problem
determination
and
has
indicated
therefore
example
that
arbitration
is
the
process
which
the
party
should
engage
in.
that
--
this
court
also
indicated
in
the
trilogy
cases
as
i
recall
it
that
under
the
guise
of
determining
arbitrability,
the
courts
may
not
determine
the
merits
of
a
particular
grievance.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
labor
board
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
that
under
the
guise
of
determining
relevance
it
is
in
fact
issuing
a
judgment
as
to
how
valid
or
how
invalid
a
grievance
is.
if
it
is
not
doing
that,
if
the
labor
board
is
not
doing
that
and
if
it
is
only
saying
that
any
request
for
information
related
to
a
contract
provision
must
be
given
then
i
think
that
the
labor
board
is
throwing
out
the
test
of
relevance
for
information
is
saying
to
you
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
any
request
for
information
which
may
be
related
to
a
contract
must
be
given.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
request
--
that
that
type
of
position
has
no
foundation
in
the
law
and
runs
contrary
to
the
type
of
relationship
which
the
law
has
attempted
to
establish
between
union
and
employer.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
believe
that
section
10
(a)
relates
to
the
board's
power
to
determine
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
threshold
question
is
to
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
can
be
found
to
exist
where
the
basis
of
the
claim
rest
within
the
four
corners
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
initial
threshold
question
must
first
to
be
determined
before
section
10
(a)
has
any
application
whatsoever.
now
if
for
example
under
section
8
(d)
(4)
where
the
definition
of
collective
bargaining
is
given,
if
one
were
to
presume
that
a
union
claim
for
an
amendment
of
a
contract
were
involved.
it
might
be
settled,
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
their
refusal
to
bargain
under
the
definition
to
8
(d)(4).
if
the
union
were
to
claim
that
it
was
not
attempting
to
amend
the
contract
but
under
the
contract
in
fact
had
the
right
to
make
the
claim
it
was
making
then
you
would
come
to
the
question
of
the
balance
it
seems
to
me
between
the
board's
authority
and
the
authority
of
the
parties
to
determine
their
own
private
method
of
solution.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
and
i
would
--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes.
yes,
indeed
it
is
but
the
question
is
as
to
whether
that
power
exists.
whether
the
power
exist
to
determine
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
involved
where
the
issue
is
one
of
contract
interpretation.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
saying
the
10
(a)
applies
we
assume
a
way
the
real
issue.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
would
think
that
in
the
event
of
a
discharge
of
an
employee
that
the
union
claim
to
be
a
violation
of
section
7
and
8
(a)
(3)
that
this
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
to
which
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
claim
information
without
any
regard
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
whatsoever.
i
think
in
fact,
the
position
that
we
take
is
that
where
information
is
relevant
to
the
bargaining
function
without
relation
to
the
existence
of
the
bargaining
agreement
that
information
falls
under
the
general
rules
which
have
applied
and
that
were
relevant
to
the
function
and
were
needed
and
where
there
aren't
affirmative
defenses
available
then
it
would
have
to
be
given.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
not
necessarily
i
think
of
course
that
any
union
claim
which
claims
a
violation
of
contract
constitutes
a
grievance.
i
think
that
if
there
were
no
employees
affected
thereby,
that
the
employer
would
not
have
to
give
information.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
for
example,
this
court
might
take
judicial
notice
when
an
employer
is
out
on
a
strike,
the
customers
can
be
lost.
and
the
record
does
not
show
as
counsel
for
the
labor
board
would
indicate
that
employees
were
laid
off
at
the
commencement
of
this
contract
as
an
affirmative
act.
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
--
in
fact
those
employees
were
not
called
back
to
work
after
the
strike
because
of
the
lost
of
the
work.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
so.
for
example,
8
(a)
(1)
interference,
8
(a)
(2)
domination,
8
(a)
(3)
discrimination,
8
(a)
(4)
interfering
with
the
testimony
or
witnesses
to
a
board
proceeding
are
particular
prohibitions
of
the
act
which
whether
or
not
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
nevertheless
be
cognizable
by
the
labor
board.
the
board
would
retain
its
power
whether
or
not
the
contract
has
anything
to
do
with
that.
but
8
(a)
(5)
deals
with
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
8
(a)
(5)
it
seems
to
me
must
involve
two
types
of
bargaining.
one,
pre-contract
bargaining
and
two,
post-contract
bargaining
and
it
is
our
contention
that
post-contract
bargaining
is
not
the
same
as
pre-contract
bargaining
that
the
parties
do
have
the
right
to
channel
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
them
during
the
term
of
that
agreement.
that
that
parties
do
have
a
right
to
determine
both
the
substance
as
well
as
the
procedure
of
collective
bargaining
during
the
terms
of
that
agreement.
and
if
this
not
be
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
in
this
and
in
the
companion
case
is
to
declare
that
an
employer
may
not
act
unilaterally
even
during
the
term
of
the
contract
unless
that
contract
specifically
allows
it
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
this
board
is
attempting
to
instill
in
the
labor
management
relationship
picture
in
this
country
is
the
idea
that
an
employer
may
not
act
unilaterally
without
prior
union
approval.
and
if
that
be
the
case
then
i
say
that
the
american
industrial
set
up
is
in
dire
jeopardy.
this
is
not
a
totally
unimportant
case
involving
just
a
hundred
employees
to
the
extent
that
that
issue
is
involved.
it
involves
all
of
american
industry.
thank
you
very
much.
