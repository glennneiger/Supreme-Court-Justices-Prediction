justice
abe
fortas
and
i
supposed
all
that
this
assumes
is
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
order
that
information
be
given
to
the
union
as
ancillary
to
a
grievance
--
to
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
suppose
when
that
--
can
i
ask
you,
is
there
any
doubt
that
the
board
has
a
power
to
order
a
company
to
give
the
union
information
as
ancillary
to
collective
bargaining?
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
clarify
this
for
myself
in
a
kind
of
a
simple
way.
let's
assume
that
these
were
--
clearly
everybody
agreed
that
what's
involved
here
is
a
grievance,
nothing
more.
then
would
the
board
have
jurisdiction
order
that
the
company
give
the
union,
information
related
to
that
grievance
no
question
as
to
--
it's
being
possibly
relevant
to
collective
bargaining.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
we
have
here
the
hard
question
as
to
whether
the
board
has
a
power
under
the
statutory
scheme,
the
order
of
the
company
to
give
the
union
information
relating
to
a
grievance
not
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
in
either
sense,
either
in
the
sense
of
making
the
agreement
or
the
administration
of
the
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
cut
right
into
the
bone
with
that
analysis
because
doesn't
the
statute
say
that
the
boards
for
now
in
effect
that
the
boards
have
no
jurisdiction
to
what,
construe
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
--
if
you
want
on
just
the
statute,
section
10
(a)
of
the
statute
which
is
set
forth
on
page
37
of
the
board's
brief,
says
that
the
board
is
empowered
as
here
and
after
provided
to
prevent
any
person
from
engaging
in
any
unfair
labor
practice
affecting
commerce.
this
power
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
that
has
been
or
maybe
established
by
agreement,
law
or
otherwise.
now
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
company
sent
the
union
a
letter
and
say,
"in
response
to
your
request
we
call
your
attention
to
the
following
facts."
and
then
tell
them
what
you've
just
told
us?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it's
not
what
i
asked
you.
now,
i
asked
you
whether
the
company
wrote
the
union
the
facts.
you're
telling
us
some
facts
here.
i'm
asking
you
whether
the
company
supplied
at
least
that
much
information
to
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
but
still,
that
wasn't
what
i
asked
you,
i
asked
you
whether
the
company
supplied
the
union
the
information
about
this
equipment
or
whether
the
company
would
--
it
decided
to
stand
on
what
it
considered
to
be
of
strict
legal
rights,
and
then
tell
me,
didn't
give
the
union
any
information.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
--
can
you
think
of
any
grievance
that
might
arise
between
the
company
and
the
union
in
which
the
board
would
have
jurisdiction
to
order
the
company
to
supply
information
to
the
union
on
your
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
a
company
moved
out
two
thirds
of
its
plant
equipment
and
the
union
asked
for
information
about
that.
i
--
i
assumed
that
would
be
a
grievance
at
the
very
least
but
if
they
get
the
--
company
would
have
to
supply
that
information?
justice
abe
fortas
let
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
what
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
there
are
some
types
of
situations
in
which
a
grievance
exist
between
the
company
and
the
union
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
the
nature
of
the
dispute
as
such
that
also
stands
directly
from
certain
provisions
in
the
statute
and
then
the
latter
cases,
the
board
processes
are
appropriate
to
require
the
company
to
give
the
union
information.
justice
abe
fortas

i
