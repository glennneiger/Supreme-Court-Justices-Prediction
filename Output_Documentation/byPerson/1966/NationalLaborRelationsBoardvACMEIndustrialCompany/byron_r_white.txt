well,
mr.
come
with
that
letter
of
the
company
accurately
as
saying
that
no
matter
what
we're
doing,
no
employee
is
being
laid
off,
no
employee
is
being
discharged
because
there's
no
basis
for
a
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
taking
the
position
then
that
even
if
no

an
issue
whether
that
the
refusal
to
supply
the
information
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice

even
though
the
arbitrator
might
reach
the
conclusion
that
under

the
no
employees
are
affected.

to
supply
information
for
the
purpose
of
processing
grievances
shall
be
a
matter
exclusively
for
the
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
and
that
neither
party
may
result
to
any
other
provision
of

or
otherwise.
