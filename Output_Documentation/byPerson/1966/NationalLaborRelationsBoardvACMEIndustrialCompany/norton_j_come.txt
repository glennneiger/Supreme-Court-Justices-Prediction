mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
a
board
order
requiring
the
company
to
furnish
certain
information
to
the
union
which
the
union
requested
in
connection
with
the
processing
of
grievances.
and
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
--
where
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
parties
has
a
standard
type
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
which
i
will
detail
in
a
moment.
this
necessarily
has
the
effect
of
channeling
all
requests
for
grievance
information
into
that
procedure
and
thereby
preempting
the
power
that
the
board
would
ordinarily
have
to
remedy
refusals
to
furnish
such
information
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relationship
act.
now
the
underlying
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
maybe
summarized
as
follows.
in
april
of
1963,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
strike,
the
company
which
is
a
manufacturer
of
tools
and
metal
products
in
chicago
and
the
union,
local
310
of
the
autoworkers
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
at
the
company's
laflin
street
plant
chicago.
the
company
has
several
other
plants
in
addition.
there
are
two
substantive
provisions
of
the
contract
which
are
relevant
here.
there
is
article
1,
section
(3)
which
is
set
forth
at
page
96
of
the
record,
which
is
the
so-called
subcontracting
clause.
under
this
clause
in
relevant
part,
the
company
agreed
not
to
subcontract
work
which
is
normally
performed
by
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
where
this
will
cause
the
layoff
of
employees
or
prevent
the
recall
of
employees
who
would
normally
perform
this
work
for
the
company.
the
second
clause
is
the
so-called
work
transfer
clause
which
is
article
6,
section
(10)
set
forth
at
page
102
of
the
record
and
that
provides
that
in
the
event
the
equipment
of
the
plant
or
of
any
department
is
hereafter
moved
to
another
location
of
the
company.
employees
working
in
the
laflin
street
plant
were
subject
to
layoff
or
reduction
and
classification
as
a
result
of
this
transfer
but
have
a
right
to
follow
the
machinery
to
the
new
location
unless
of
course
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
that
location
that
would
provide
otherwise.
now
in
addition
to
these
two
substantive
provisions,
this
contract
also
contained
a
procedure
for
the
processing
of
grievances
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
98
to
a
hundred
of
the
record
which
is
a
first
of
all
a
grievances
defined
as
a
difference
of
opinion
with
respect
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
and
then
you
have
three
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure
and
if
the
grievance
is
not
settled
at
the
end
of
the
third
step,
then
the
union
has
a
right
to
take
it
to
binding
arbitration.
and
the
arbitration
clause
which
is
set
forth
at
page
100
of
the
record
again
points
out
that
the
arbitrator's
authority
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement
which
ties
in
with
the
way
the
grievance
is
defined
which
i
pointed
out
earlier
as
being
a
difference
of
opinion
with
respect
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
the
subcontracting
provision
which
is
at
page
96,
the
substantive
terms
of
which
i
read
specifically
states
that
violation
of
the
above,
namely
the
subcontracting
clause
will
be
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure.
now,
in
january
of
1964
some
months
after
this
contract
was
executed,
the
union
discovered
that
machinery
was
being
moved
from
the
laflin
street
plant.
and
there
was
no
dispute
in
the
record
that
machinery
was
being
moved.
union
stewards
asked
the
foremen
why
the
machinery
was
being
removed
and
where
it
was
being
relocated.
because
under
the
work
transfer
clause
if
it
was
going
to
another
plant
of
the
company,
the
employees
here
of
they
--
or
losing
jobs
a
result
of
this
had
a
right
to
follow
it.
also,
if
the
machinery
was
going
to
some
other
plant
which
would
then
be
doing
production
work
that
this
plant
was
doing
under
the
subcontracting
clause,
employees
who
are
--
or
affected
or
were
in
layoff
would
have
a
right
to
grieve
about
that.
and
i
might
add
that
the
record
shows
that
during
this
period
it
was
not
only
the
machinery
being
moved
but
you
had
in
layoff
a
substantial
number
of
employees.
it
fluctuated
from
35
at
one
time
to
as
high
as
70.
also
you
had
employment
dropping
in
the
plant,
it
was
a
190
at
the
end
of
the
strike
and
it
got
down
to
a
115.
so
there
was
some
basis
for
the
union's
suspicions
that
something
was
occurring
here.
so
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
company
had
other
plants
in
the
area.
this
contract
however
covered
only
the
laflin
street
plant.
so
the
union
stewards
ask
the
foremen
why
the
machinery
was
being
removed
and
where
it
was
being
relocated.
the
foremen
said
they
would
have
to
check
it
out.
they
went
to
the
industrial
relations
department
and
then
they
came
back
with
the
answer
that
since
there
had
been
no
violation
of
the
contract,
the
company
was
not
obliged
to
furnish
the
union
with
any
information.
this
occurred
several
times,
several
different
foremen
got
the
same
response.
the
union
then
invoking
the
contract
grievance
machinery
filed
11
grievances
charging
that
the
company
by
removing
machinery
from
the
plant
had
deprived
the
employees
of
job
rights
and
employment
in
violation
of
the
subcontracting
and
work
transfer
clauses
of
the
contract
which
i
outlined
at
the
outset.
without
the
information
understandably
the
union
couldn't
get
too
far
in
the
grievance
procedure.
so
in
april
of
64,
while
these
grievances
were
pending
some
on
the
first
step
and
some
on
the
second
step
of
the
grievance
procedure,
the
president
of
the
union
wrote
a
letter
to
the
company
which
is
set
forth
at
page
a
124
of
the
record
requesting
five
specific
pieces
of
information,
information
as
to
the
date
on
which
each
piece
of
equipment
was
moved
from
the
plant.
the
place
to
which
the
equipment
was
moved
whether
it
was
a
facility
owned
or
controlled
by
the
company.
the
number
of
machines
or
equipment
moved.
the
reason
for
the
move
and
whether
or
not
the
machinery
was
being
used
for
production
purposes
elsewhere.
the
letter
concluded
with
the
statement
that
this
information
is
essential
to
the
union
for
the
servicing
and
administration
of
the
current
contract.
the
company
flatly
declined
the
union's
request
in
a
letter
at
page
125
of
the
record
stating
among
other
things
that
the
union
had
available
all
the
information
it
needed
and
that
its
questions
were
indicative
of
officiating
and
harassment
expedition.
well,
the
union
thereupon
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
relations
board
alleging
that
the
company's
refusal
to
furnish
this
information
constituted
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively
in
violation
of
section
88
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
--
that
is
what
they
are
saying
however,
our
position
is
that
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
grievance
and
not
to
the
union's
right
to
obtain
information.
the
information,
in
fact
verified
this
--
the
union
might
not
process
the
grievance
further.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
because
the
union
first
of
all
thought
that
there
were
some
employees
affected.
that
is
an
issue
of
fact
for
the
arbitrator.
secondly,
under
the
subcontracting
clause
as
i
indicated
at
the
out
set
there
were
employees
in
layoff
and
they
would
have
a
right
to
be
recalled
from
the
layoff
if
there
were
illegal
subcontracting
going
on.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
the
question
that
i
intend
to
get
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
i
think
we
can
start
with
two
principles
as
to
which
there
is
no
doubt.
(a)
that
the
duty
to
bargain
imposed
by
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(d)
of
the
act
extends
beyond
the
mere
negotiation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
applies
to
the
administration
of
the
agreement
as
well.
the
second
principle
that
--
well,
we
can
start
with
is
that
ordinarily
the
duty
to
bargain
comprehends
the
obligation
to
furnish
information
that
is
relevant
to
the
discharge
of
the
union's
bargaining
function.
be
it
--
they
admitted
--
be
it
a
negotiation
of
the
contract
or
the
administration
of
the
contract.
the
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
it
can
properly
be
said
that
when
the
parties,
the
union
and
the
company
have
negotiated
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
sets
forth
a
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
such
as
we
have
here
which
is
limited
to
questions
of
interpretation
arising
under
the
agreement.
it
can
be
said
that
they
have
not
only
channeled
the
substantive
grievance
to
arbitration
but
also
information
request
that
are
relevant
to
the
processing
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
would
your
honor
and
i
think
that's
the
--
that
is
this
case
is,
as
we
view
it
because
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
although
the
company
in
it's
brief
attempts
to
raise
some
question
as
to
whether
this
is
really
a
grievable
matter
under
the
contract.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
there
is
not
question
that
in
this
case
the
matters
complained
of
are
grievable
matters.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
with
this
footnote
that
i
would
interpolate
that
the
processing
of
grievances
is
regarded
as
part
of
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
so
that
in
discharging
that
function,
the
union
is
engaging
in
collective
bargaining.
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made
that
perfectly
clear,
of
course
the
parties
can
by
agreement,
a
channel,
certain
rights
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
board
was
warranted
in
construing
this
kind
of
a
grievance
procedure
that
way
it
did.
and
i
would
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
says
that
in
so
many
words
and
i
might
say
that
this
issue
is
--
in
our
view
is
going
to
be
presented
in
sharper
focus
in
the
case
that
follows.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
and
start
out
with
the
outset
by
saying
that
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
case
than
this
one.
my
position
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
my
position
would
be
that
under
10
(a)
the
board
would
have
power
but
nevertheless
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
situation
that
you're
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
situation
you're
presenting,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
may
not
be
here
not
for
the
reason
that
the
board
would
not
have
power
but
as
your
honor
is
aware,
the
board
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
discretion
thus
differ
to
arbitrable
arrangements
and
adjustments
and
whether
that
sort
of
a
situation
would
be
an
appropriate
one
for
board
deferral
would
be
the
question.
i
don't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
position
on
that.
but
in
any
event,
we
do
not
have
that
case
here
for
the
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
get
to.
before
i
do
so,
i
just
like
to
back
up
to
make
a
--
to
fill
in
a
part
of
the
chronology
which
i
think
is
fairly
obvious
but
i
left
off
my
factual
account
by
saying
that
the
union
had
filed
the
charge
with
the
board,
a
complaint
was
issued.
the
board
found
that
the
information
was
relevant
to
the
union's
representative
function
under
the
contract
that
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
the
union's
right
to
obtain
such
information
in
advance
of
arbitration
under
this
type
of
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
and
the
board
issued
an
appropriate
bargaining
order.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
essentially
along
the
lines
that
you
were
suggesting
mr.
justice
fortas
in
the
--
that's
why
we
are
here.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
heart
of
our
legal
position
here.
as
i
pointed
out
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provision
here
and
the
board
so
found
does
not
say
anything
about
request
for
information.
it
talks
only
about
questions
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
agreement.
there
is
no
provision
in
this
agreement
dealing
with
information.
in
short
it's
the
standard
type
of
what
this
court
referred
to
in
the
trilogy
cases
as
the
standard
type
of
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
and
therefore
a
dispute
over
information
as
such
would
not
fall
within
the
normal
meaning
of
the
terms
--
questions
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
now,
furthermore
we
submit
and
the
board
found
that
it
is
reasonable
and
indeed
would
aid
the
efficient
operation
of
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
to
construe
at
least
the
standard
type
of
arbitration
provision
is
not
encompassing
information
request.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
information
is
needed
at
the
outset
of
a
grievance
procedure
to
enable
the
union
to
determine
whether
the
grievance
is
worth
processing
further.
as
i
pointed
out,
this
grievance
procedure
like
most
of
them
has
got
three
steps
before
you
ever
get
to
arbitration.
arbitration
is
the
last
and
most
costly
step
in
the
grievance
procedure.
now,
if
the
union
gets
the
information
at
the
outset,
it
may
decide
to
drop
the
grievance
because
the
information
persuades
it
that
there
is
no
merit
to
the
grievance.
or
it
might
be
able
to
persuade
the
employer
to
adjust
the
grievance
without
embarking
in
the
costly
informal
course
of
arbitration.
i
was
looking
at
some
statistics
of
the
federal
mediation
conciliation
service
and
they
pointed
out
that
the
average
cost
of
a
one
day
arbitration
hearing
just
taking
into
account
the
cost
of
the
arbitrator,
the
attorney's
fees
and
of
the
court
reporter
leaving
out
such
things
as
travel
expense
and
things
of
that
sort,
came
to
about
$1600.00.
now,
on
the
other
hand
to
hold
that
the
information
request
must
be
presented
to
the
arbitrator
means
that
the
union
or
either
--
well
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
sepner
case,
it
will
be
--
it
will
have
to
play
a
game
of
blind
men's
bluff.
i
mean,
either
they
will
have
to
take
all
grievances
and
arbitration
which
means
that
a
lot
of
them
are
going
to
go
there
that
the
information
would
to
be
unmeritorious?
the
union
would
have
to
grope
through
the
arbitration
proceeding
itself
they
all
prepared
or
it
will
just
have
to
arbitrarily
drop
a
lot
of
grievances
that
information
would
have
shown
to
be
meritorious.
the
first
form
of
the
dilemma
is
only
joined
to
make
the
grievance
procedures
which
have
already
been
criticized
as
being
too
cumbersome,
plugged,
protracted
even
more
so.
the
other
form
of
the
dilemma
is
going
to
mean
that
the
union
could
not
adequately
discharge
its
representative
function
at
least
in
an
intelligent
manner.
what
i
have
been
saying
about
the
grievance
procedure
being
plugged
is
not
sheer
speculation.
i
think
the
union
in
its
brief
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
points
out
that
under
the
uaw
general
motors
contracts
for
example
in
the
year
of
1964,
a
168,000
--
158,000
written
grievances
were
filed.
now
about
67%
of
them
were
settled
at
the
initial
step,
25%
at
the
second
step
and
less
than
1%
went
to
arbitration.
now
under
that
contract,
they
get
the
information
in
advance
indeed
the
union
has
set
up
a
screening
procedure
before
they
reached
the
final
stage
of
arbitration
in
which
they
sift
out
many
of
these
grievances.
so
in
the
light
of
this
practical
considerations
we
submit
that
the
board
is
reasonable
in
concluding
that
the
standard
type
of
arbitration
should
not
be
construed
as
a
waiver
of
the
union's
right
to
get
the
information
in
advance
of
having
to
go
--
to
arbitration.
and
that
such
an
interpretation
far
from
being
contrary
to
the
difference
which
this
court
in
the
trilogy
has
shown
for
the
arbitral
process
would
facilitate,
enhance
the
arbitral
process.
now,
i
want
to
point
that
there's
no
answer
to
suggest
that
the
union
could
go
to
an
arbitrator
in
advance
and
get
--
have
him
require
the
production
of
this
data.
in
most
jurisdictions,
the
arbitrator
does
not
have
subpoena
power.
secondly
even
where
he
does
and
the
company
points
out
that
he
does
under
the
uniform
arbitration
act
in
illinois,
the
arbitrator
still
sets
to
handle
grievances
that
are
unresolved
by
the
earlier
stages
in
the
grievance
procedure.
he
is
not
the
administrator
of
the
machinery.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
this
contract
as
--
is
typical
of
most,
you
cannot
go
to
the
arbitrator
until
you
have
exhausted
the
other
three
stages
of
the
grievance
procedures
so
that
the
union
would
still
have
to
go
through
what
might
well
be
the
useless
and
burdensome
act
of
going
through
three
stages
of
the
grievance
procedure
before
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
arbitrator
and
ask
him
for
a
pretrial
order.
secondly,
where
you
have
a
setup
as
you
have
here
whether
there's
no
permanent
arbitrator
and
you
have
only
an
ad
hoc
one
established
as
the
need
arises
you
have
to
go
through
the
further
formal
step
of
getting
one
selected
and
all
of
that.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
i
just
like
to
close
with
the
point
that
the
company
in
its
brief
discusses
a
lot
--
a
lack
of
merit
to
the
grievance
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
goes
--
the
merits
of
the
underlying
grievance
which
they
give
perfectly
agreed
to
submit
to
the
arbitrator.
the
information
indeed
might
have
resulted
in
their
washing
out
of
grievance.
if
it
has
no
merit
and
there
is
certainly
no
harm
in
furnishing
the
information
to
substantiate
that
point.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
the
usual
procedure
as
i
understand
it
has
been
to
supply
this
information.
i
think
that
since
this
court's
decision
in
the
trilogy
cases,
there
has
been
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration
didn't
extend
so
far
as
to
cover
even
this
information
matter
is
and
therefore
we
have
been
getting
cases
that
have
raised
the
problem.
and
i
think
that
what
for
the
trilogy
cases
there
probably
would
have
been
a
little
question
that
the
information
would
be
produceable
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
substantive
grievance
would
have
to
go
up
through
the
grievance
procedure.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
a
board
order
requiring
the
company
to
furnish
certain
information
to
the
union
which
the
union
requested
in
connection
with
the
processing
of
grievances.
and
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
--
where
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
parties
has
a
standard
type
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
which
i
will
detail
in
a
moment.
this
necessarily
has
the
effect
of
channeling
all
requests
for
grievance
information
into
that
procedure
and
thereby
preempting
the
power
that
the
board
would
ordinarily
have
to
remedy
refusals
to
furnish
such
information
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relationship
act.
now
the
underlying
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
maybe
summarized
as
follows.
in
april
of
1963,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
strike,
the
company
which
is
a
manufacturer
of
tools
and
metal
products
in
chicago
and
the
union,
local
310
of
the
autoworkers
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
at
the
company's
laflin
street
plant
chicago.
the
company
has
several
other
plants
in
addition.
there
are
two
substantive
provisions
of
the
contract
which
are
relevant
here.
there
is
article
1,
section
(3)
which
is
set
forth
at
page
96
of
the
record,
which
is
the
so-called
subcontracting
clause.
under
this
clause
in
relevant
part,
the
company
agreed
not
to
subcontract
work
which
is
normally
performed
by
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
where
this
will
cause
the
layoff
of
employees
or
prevent
the
recall
of
employees
who
would
normally
perform
this
work
for
the
company.
the
second
clause
is
the
so-called
work
transfer
clause
which
is
article
6,
section
(10)
set
forth
at
page
102
of
the
record
and
that
provides
that
in
the
event
the
equipment
of
the
plant
or
of
any
department
is
hereafter
moved
to
another
location
of
the
company.
employees
working
in
the
laflin
street
plant
were
subject
to
layoff
or
reduction
and
classification
as
a
result
of
this
transfer
but
have
a
right
to
follow
the
machinery
to
the
new
location
unless
of
course
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
that
location
that
would
provide
otherwise.
now
in
addition
to
these
two
substantive
provisions,
this
contract
also
contained
a
procedure
for
the
processing
of
grievances
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
98
to
a
hundred
of
the
record
which
is
a
first
of
all
a
grievances
defined
as
a
difference
of
opinion
with
respect
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
and
then
you
have
three
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure
and
if
the
grievance
is
not
settled
at
the
end
of
the
third
step,
then
the
union
has
a
right
to
take
it
to
binding
arbitration.
and
the
arbitration
clause
which
is
set
forth
at
page
100
of
the
record
again
points
out
that
the
arbitrator's
authority
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement
which
ties
in
with
the
way
the
grievance
is
defined
which
i
pointed
out
earlier
as
being
a
difference
of
opinion
with
respect
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
the
subcontracting
provision
which
is
at
page
96,
the
substantive
terms
of
which
i
read
specifically
states
that
violation
of
the
above,
namely
the
subcontracting
clause
will
be
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure.
now,
in
january
of
1964
some
months
after
this
contract
was
executed,
the
union
discovered
that
machinery
was
being
moved
from
the
laflin
street
plant.
and
there
was
no
dispute
in
the
record
that
machinery
was
being
moved.
union
stewards
asked
the
foremen
why
the
machinery
was
being
removed
and
where
it
was
being
relocated.
because
under
the
work
transfer
clause
if
it
was
going
to
another
plant
of
the
company,
the
employees
here
of
they
--
or
losing
jobs
a
result
of
this
had
a
right
to
follow
it.
also,
if
the
machinery
was
going
to
some
other
plant
which
would
then
be
doing
production
work
that
this
plant
was
doing
under
the
subcontracting
clause,
employees
who
are
--
or
affected
or
were
in
layoff
would
have
a
right
to
grieve
about
that.
and
i
might
add
that
the
record
shows
that
during
this
period
it
was
not
only
the
machinery
being
moved
but
you
had
in
layoff
a
substantial
number
of
employees.
it
fluctuated
from
35
at
one
time
to
as
high
as
70.
also
you
had
employment
dropping
in
the
plant,
it
was
a
190
at
the
end
of
the
strike
and
it
got
down
to
a
115.
so
there
was
some
basis
for
the
union's
suspicions
that
something
was
occurring
here.
so
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
company
had
other
plants
in
the
area.
this
contract
however
covered
only
the
laflin
street
plant.
so
the
union
stewards
ask
the
foremen
why
the
machinery
was
being
removed
and
where
it
was
being
relocated.
the
foremen
said
they
would
have
to
check
it
out.
they
went
to
the
industrial
relations
department
and
then
they
came
back
with
the
answer
that
since
there
had
been
no
violation
of
the
contract,
the
company
was
not
obliged
to
furnish
the
union
with
any
information.
this
occurred
several
times,
several
different
foremen
got
the
same
response.
the
union
then
invoking
the
contract
grievance
machinery
filed
11
grievances
charging
that
the
company
by
removing
machinery
from
the
plant
had
deprived
the
employees
of
job
rights
and
employment
in
violation
of
the
subcontracting
and
work
transfer
clauses
of
the
contract
which
i
outlined
at
the
outset.
without
the
information
understandably
the
union
couldn't
get
too
far
in
the
grievance
procedure.
so
in
april
of
64,
while
these
grievances
were
pending
some
on
the
first
step
and
some
on
the
second
step
of
the
grievance
procedure,
the
president
of
the
union
wrote
a
letter
to
the
company
which
is
set
forth
at
page
a
124
of
the
record
requesting
five
specific
pieces
of
information,
information
as
to
the
date
on
which
each
piece
of
equipment
was
moved
from
the
plant.
the
place
to
which
the
equipment
was
moved
whether
it
was
a
facility
owned
or
controlled
by
the
company.
the
number
of
machines
or
equipment
moved.
the
reason
for
the
move
and
whether
or
not
the
machinery
was
being
used
for
production
purposes
elsewhere.
the
letter
concluded
with
the
statement
that
this
information
is
essential
to
the
union
for
the
servicing
and
administration
of
the
current
contract.
the
company
flatly
declined
the
union's
request
in
a
letter
at
page
125
of
the
record
stating
among
other
things
that
the
union
had
available
all
the
information
it
needed
and
that
its
questions
were
indicative
of
officiating
and
harassment
expedition.
well,
the
union
thereupon
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
relations
board
alleging
that
the
company's
refusal
to
furnish
this
information
constituted
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively
in
violation
of
section
88
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
--
that
is
what
they
are
saying
however,
our
position
is
that
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
grievance
and
not
to
the
union's
right
to
obtain
information.
the
information,
in
fact
verified
this
--
the
union
might
not
process
the
grievance
further.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
because
the
union
first
of
all
thought
that
there
were
some
employees
affected.
that
is
an
issue
of
fact
for
the
arbitrator.
secondly,
under
the
subcontracting
clause
as
i
indicated
at
the
out
set
there
were
employees
in
layoff
and
they
would
have
a
right
to
be
recalled
from
the
layoff
if
there
were
illegal
subcontracting
going
on.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
the
question
that
i
intend
to
get
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
i
think
we
can
start
with
two
principles
as
to
which
there
is
no
doubt.
(a)
that
the
duty
to
bargain
imposed
by
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(d)
of
the
act
extends
beyond
the
mere
negotiation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
applies
to
the
administration
of
the
agreement
as
well.
the
second
principle
that
--
well,
we
can
start
with
is
that
ordinarily
the
duty
to
bargain
comprehends
the
obligation
to
furnish
information
that
is
relevant
to
the
discharge
of
the
union's
bargaining
function.
be
it
--
they
admitted
--
be
it
a
negotiation
of
the
contract
or
the
administration
of
the
contract.
the
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
it
can
properly
be
said
that
when
the
parties,
the
union
and
the
company
have
negotiated
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
sets
forth
a
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
such
as
we
have
here
which
is
limited
to
questions
of
interpretation
arising
under
the
agreement.
it
can
be
said
that
they
have
not
only
channeled
the
substantive
grievance
to
arbitration
but
also
information
request
that
are
relevant
to
the
processing
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
would
your
honor
and
i
think
that's
the
--
that
is
this
case
is,
as
we
view
it
because
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
although
the
company
in
it's
brief
attempts
to
raise
some
question
as
to
whether
this
is
really
a
grievable
matter
under
the
contract.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
there
is
not
question
that
in
this
case
the
matters
complained
of
are
grievable
matters.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
with
this
footnote
that
i
would
interpolate
that
the
processing
of
grievances
is
regarded
as
part
of
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
so
that
in
discharging
that
function,
the
union
is
engaging
in
collective
bargaining.
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made
that
perfectly
clear,
of
course
the
parties
can
by
agreement,
a
channel,
certain
rights
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
board
was
warranted
in
construing
this
kind
of
a
grievance
procedure
that
way
it
did.
and
i
would
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
says
that
in
so
many
words
and
i
might
say
that
this
issue
is
--
in
our
view
is
going
to
be
presented
in
sharper
focus
in
the
case
that
follows.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
and
start
out
with
the
outset
by
saying
that
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
case
than
this
one.
my
position
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
my
position
would
be
that
under
10
(a)
the
board
would
have
power
but
nevertheless
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
situation
that
you're
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
situation
you're
presenting,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
may
not
be
here
not
for
the
reason
that
the
board
would
not
have
power
but
as
your
honor
is
aware,
the
board
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
discretion
thus
differ
to
arbitrable
arrangements
and
adjustments
and
whether
that
sort
of
a
situation
would
be
an
appropriate
one
for
board
deferral
would
be
the
question.
i
don't
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
position
on
that.
but
in
any
event,
we
do
not
have
that
case
here
for
the
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
get
to.
before
i
do
so,
i
just
like
to
back
up
to
make
a
--
to
fill
in
a
part
of
the
chronology
which
i
think
is
fairly
obvious
but
i
left
off
my
factual
account
by
saying
that
the
union
had
filed
the
charge
with
the
board,
a
complaint
was
issued.
the
board
found
that
the
information
was
relevant
to
the
union's
representative
function
under
the
contract
that
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
the
union's
right
to
obtain
such
information
in
advance
of
arbitration
under
this
type
of
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
and
the
board
issued
an
appropriate
bargaining
order.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
essentially
along
the
lines
that
you
were
suggesting
mr.
justice
fortas
in
the
--
that's
why
we
are
here.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
heart
of
our
legal
position
here.
as
i
pointed
out
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provision
here
and
the
board
so
found
does
not
say
anything
about
request
for
information.
it
talks
only
about
questions
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
agreement.
there
is
no
provision
in
this
agreement
dealing
with
information.
in
short
it's
the
standard
type
of
what
this
court
referred
to
in
the
trilogy
cases
as
the
standard
type
of
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
and
therefore
a
dispute
over
information
as
such
would
not
fall
within
the
normal
meaning
of
the
terms
--
questions
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
now,
furthermore
we
submit
and
the
board
found
that
it
is
reasonable
and
indeed
would
aid
the
efficient
operation
of
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
to
construe
at
least
the
standard
type
of
arbitration
provision
is
not
encompassing
information
request.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
information
is
needed
at
the
outset
of
a
grievance
procedure
to
enable
the
union
to
determine
whether
the
grievance
is
worth
processing
further.
as
i
pointed
out,
this
grievance
procedure
like
most
of
them
has
got
three
steps
before
you
ever
get
to
arbitration.
arbitration
is
the
last
and
most
costly
step
in
the
grievance
procedure.
now,
if
the
union
gets
the
information
at
the
outset,
it
may
decide
to
drop
the
grievance
because
the
information
persuades
it
that
there
is
no
merit
to
the
grievance.
or
it
might
be
able
to
persuade
the
employer
to
adjust
the
grievance
without
embarking
in
the
costly
informal
course
of
arbitration.
i
was
looking
at
some
statistics
of
the
federal
mediation
conciliation
service
and
they
pointed
out
that
the
average
cost
of
a
one
day
arbitration
hearing
just
taking
into
account
the
cost
of
the
arbitrator,
the
attorney's
fees
and
of
the
court
reporter
leaving
out
such
things
as
travel
expense
and
things
of
that
sort,
came
to
about
$1600.00.
now,
on
the
other
hand
to
hold
that
the
information
request
must
be
presented
to
the
arbitrator
means
that
the
union
or
either
--
well
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
sepner
case,
it
will
be
--
it
will
have
to
play
a
game
of
blind
men's
bluff.
i
mean,
either
they
will
have
to
take
all
grievances
and
arbitration
which
means
that
a
lot
of
them
are
going
to
go
there
that
the
information
would
to
be
unmeritorious?
the
union
would
have
to
grope
through
the
arbitration
proceeding
itself
they
all
prepared
or
it
will
just
have
to
arbitrarily
drop
a
lot
of
grievances
that
information
would
have
shown
to
be
meritorious.
the
first
form
of
the
dilemma
is
only
joined
to
make
the
grievance
procedures
which
have
already
been
criticized
as
being
too
cumbersome,
plugged,
protracted
even
more
so.
the
other
form
of
the
dilemma
is
going
to
mean
that
the
union
could
not
adequately
discharge
its
representative
function
at
least
in
an
intelligent
manner.
what
i
have
been
saying
about
the
grievance
procedure
being
plugged
is
not
sheer
speculation.
i
think
the
union
in
its
brief
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
points
out
that
under
the
uaw
general
motors
contracts
for
example
in
the
year
of
1964,
a
168,000
--
158,000
written
grievances
were
filed.
now
about
67%
of
them
were
settled
at
the
initial
step,
25%
at
the
second
step
and
less
than
1%
went
to
arbitration.
now
under
that
contract,
they
get
the
information
in
advance
indeed
the
union
has
set
up
a
screening
procedure
before
they
reached
the
final
stage
of
arbitration
in
which
they
sift
out
many
of
these
grievances.
so
in
the
light
of
this
practical
considerations
we
submit
that
the
board
is
reasonable
in
concluding
that
the
standard
type
of
arbitration
should
not
be
construed
as
a
waiver
of
the
union's
right
to
get
the
information
in
advance
of
having
to
go
--
to
arbitration.
and
that
such
an
interpretation
far
from
being
contrary
to
the
difference
which
this
court
in
the
trilogy
has
shown
for
the
arbitral
process
would
facilitate,
enhance
the
arbitral
process.
now,
i
want
to
point
that
there's
no
answer
to
suggest
that
the
union
could
go
to
an
arbitrator
in
advance
and
get
--
have
him
require
the
production
of
this
data.
in
most
jurisdictions,
the
arbitrator
does
not
have
subpoena
power.
secondly
even
where
he
does
and
the
company
points
out
that
he
does
under
the
uniform
arbitration
act
in
illinois,
the
arbitrator
still
sets
to
handle
grievances
that
are
unresolved
by
the
earlier
stages
in
the
grievance
procedure.
he
is
not
the
administrator
of
the
machinery.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
under
this
contract
as
--
is
typical
of
most,
you
cannot
go
to
the
arbitrator
until
you
have
exhausted
the
other
three
stages
of
the
grievance
procedures
so
that
the
union
would
still
have
to
go
through
what
might
well
be
the
useless
and
burdensome
act
of
going
through
three
stages
of
the
grievance
procedure
before
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
arbitrator
and
ask
him
for
a
pretrial
order.
secondly,
where
you
have
a
setup
as
you
have
here
whether
there's
no
permanent
arbitrator
and
you
have
only
an
ad
hoc
one
established
as
the
need
arises
you
have
to
go
through
the
further
formal
step
of
getting
one
selected
and
all
of
that.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
i
just
like
to
close
with
the
point
that
the
company
in
its
brief
discusses
a
lot
--
a
lack
of
merit
to
the
grievance
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
goes
--
the
merits
of
the
underlying
grievance
which
they
give
perfectly
agreed
to
submit
to
the
arbitrator.
the
information
indeed
might
have
resulted
in
their
washing
out
of
grievance.
if
it
has
no
merit
and
there
is
certainly
no
harm
in
furnishing
the
information
to
substantiate
that
point.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
the
usual
procedure
as
i
understand
it
has
been
to
supply
this
information.
i
think
that
since
this
court's
decision
in
the
trilogy
cases,
there
has
been
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration
didn't
extend
so
far
as
to
cover
even
this
information
matter
is
and
therefore
we
have
been
getting
cases
that
have
raised
the
problem.
and
i
think
that
what
for
the
trilogy
cases
there
probably
would
have
been
a
little
question
that
the
information
would
be
produceable
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
substantive
grievance
would
have
to
go
up
through
the
grievance
procedure.
thank
you.
