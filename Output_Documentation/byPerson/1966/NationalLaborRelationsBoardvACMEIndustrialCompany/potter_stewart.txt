the

judgment
of
the

is
national
labor
relations
board
against
acme
industrial
company.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
the
c
&
c
plywood
case
which
i
just
announced,
we
dealt
with
one
aspect
of
an
employer's
duty
to
bargain
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
this
case
another
aspect
of
that
problem
is
involved,
involving
the
obligation
to
furnish
information
that
allows
the
union
to
make
an
informed
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
process
grievances.
the
board
filed
that
the
information
which
the
union
requested
of
the
employer
was
necessary
in
order
to
enable
the
union
to
evaluate
intelligently
the
grievances
it
had
filed.
and
the
board
pointed
out
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
contained
no
provision
by
which
the
union
waived
any
statutory
rights
to
the
information
that
requested
and
accordingly
board
upheld
a
charge
of
the
employers'
violation
of
a
duty
under
section
8
(a)(5)
of
the
act
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order,
but
did
not
question
the
relevance
of
the
information
which
the
union
had
requested,
nor
did
it
question
the
board's
finding
that
the
union
has
not
waived
its
right
to
the
information
but
the
court
ruled
that
the
existence
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
a
provision
for
binding
arbitration
of
differences
concerning
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
agreement
foreclose
the
board
absolutely
from
exercising
its
statutory
power.
those
reasons
discussed
in
the
written
opinion,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
and
remand
the
