chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
come,
may
i
ask,
has
this
been
the
usual
procedure
in
recent
years
in
the
labor
movement
to
do
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kovar.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
kovar,
i
supposed
though
that
in
this
principle
as
applied
to
your
small
company,
it
would
also
be
applied
to
general
motors,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
that
if
the
facts
were
the
same
in
the
general
motors
case
as
it
is
in
the
acme
case
that
there
would
be
a
different
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i'm
not
--
we're
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
not
talking
about
that
but
if
the
machinery
was
moved
from
general
motors
under
the
same
conditions
that
it's
moved
here,
wouldn't
the
same
principle
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
is
all
i
want
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
union
know
where
this
machinery
was
transferred
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this,
supposed
there
was
a
disagreement
as
there
is
in
this
case
between
the
union
and
the
company
as
to
whether
this
is
relevant
or
not.
i
suppose
there
must
be
some
procedure
by
which
the
union
can
have
that
question
determined.
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
that
procedure
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
isn't
(voice
overlap)
--
that
isn't
the
law.
can't
you
give
us
something
better
than
a
national
academy
of
arbitrators?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
all
you
have
which
--
because
if
that's
all
you're
going
to
quote
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
will
--
how
would
they
know
what
the
facts
were
in
order
to
enable
them
to
determine
whether
they
should
litigate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
that
the
only
machine
that's
involved
or
those
other
machines
that
you
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
were
they
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
do
you
put
it
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
machine
that
hadn't
been
used
for
ten
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
are
--
if
the
ten
years
inoperative
machine
had
not
been
amongst
the
other
machinery
that
was
involved
in
the
case,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
