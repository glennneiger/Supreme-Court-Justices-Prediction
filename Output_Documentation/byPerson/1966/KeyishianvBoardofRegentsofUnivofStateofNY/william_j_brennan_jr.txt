justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
make
the
issue
here
different
than
it
was
in
adler?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
gather
this
what
you've
just
said
would
be
the
predicate
of
an
argument
which
you
don't
have
to
overrule
adler
defined
for
you
as
to
college
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
issues
refer
this
to
212
or
it's
fully
at
125?
is
that
one
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
one
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
but
this
not
the
three-judge
court
here
say
that
the
reach
of
the
decisions
of
the
new
york
courts
was
to
commit
the
charge
for
mere
knowing
members.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
they
don't
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
what
the
decisions
of
new
york
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
confused
now.
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
it.
you
start
out
with
a
finding
that
the
two
organizations,
new
york
and
united
states
advocate
and
preach
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
finding
that's
been
made
under
the
civil
service
law,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
under
the
civil
service
law,
a
disqualification
--
this
general
disqualification
not
only
for
teaching
but
for
all
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
only
of
those
persons
who
personally
advocate
knowing
overthrow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
you
have
such
persons
even
though
they
are
not
members
of
these
or
the
other
two
organizations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
go
on
and
say
under
105
that
if
one
--
there
is
a
presumption
that
if
one
is
a
member
of
a
particular
of
one
of
the
two
organizations,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
--
so
you
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
he
is
an
individual
who
advocates
violent
overthrow
on
the
basis
of
a
presumption
from
his
membership
in
one
of
the
two
organizations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
he
doesn't
do
so?
that's
the
question.
just
take
justice
white's
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
105
does
him
no
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
must
not
--
must
that
not
that
that
procedure
is
a
practical
matter
in
the
situation
that
justice
white
pointed
out.
you'd
have
no
alternative
on
one
basis
or
another
but
to
terminate
him,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
when
they'd
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
thought,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
sanction
of
one
action
from
the
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
criminal
penalty
for
cancelling
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
take
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
in
the
course
of
situation
where
he
has
to,
where
he
takes
the
stand
that
he
said
“i
am
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
i
don't
deny
it
but
i
do
not
agree
with
its
policy
of
overthrowing
the
government.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
agree
with
the
social
security
and
all
the
other
objectives.
that's
all
i
agree
with
but
i
am
a
member
of
the
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
whichever
is
subject
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
same
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
the
other
side
of
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
get
t
hide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
that
suppose
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
another
case
that
we
have
to
decide
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
a
quite
few
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
make
the
issue
here
different
than
it
was
in
adler?
justice
william
j.

yes,
but
i

the

where

william
j.

and?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now
but
this

justice
william

that's
because
he
doesn't
do
so?
that's
the
question.
just
take
justice
white's
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

then
105
does
him
no
