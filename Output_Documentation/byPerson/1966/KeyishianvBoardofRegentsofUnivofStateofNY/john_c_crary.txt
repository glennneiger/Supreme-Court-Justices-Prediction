mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
am
counsel
two
and
represent
the
state
university
of
new
york.
i
distinguish
the
state
university
of
new
york
from
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
because
there
is
often
confusion
about
it
even
in
new
york.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
the
board
of
regents
is
the
governing
board
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
is
a
corporation
which
has
existed
since
1784
which
is
the
head
of
new
york
education
department
under
the
new
york
constitution
and
which
in
that
capacity
have
supervisory
and
regulatory
authority
overall
education
public,
private,
elementary,
secondary
and
higher
in
the
state.
the
state
university
of
new
york
on
the
other
hand
is
a
corporation
created
in
the
education
department.
a
public
corporation
in
the
year
1948
for
the
purpose
of
administering
state
operated
and
supported
higher
education
in
the
state.
it
is
the
board
of
trustees
of
that
corporation
which
i
represent
and
which
administered
these
statutes
in
the
manner
which
had
brought
this
case
to
this
court.
the
--
i
also
represent
administrative
officers
of
the
university
including
its
new
president,
samuel
b.
gould
who
took
off
as
of
1964
after
this
case
had
risen.
i
apologize
for
my
cold.
my
concern
is
to
--
we
rely
upon
the
attorney
general's
position,
who
has
the
duty
of
defending
the
validity
of
new
york
statutes
and
we
rely
upon
and
support
the
position
which
the
attorney
general
has
taken
in
this
case
in
support
of
this
statute.
my
concern
here
is
to
attempt
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the
university
in
carrying
out
the
duties
which
became
imposed
upon
it
by
virtue
of
those
statutes
has
carried
them
out
in
accordance
with
their
valid
purpose
and
without
imposing,
super
imposing
upon
them
any
requirements
which
in
and
of
themselves
could
be
construed
as
being
beyond
the
needs
of
the
statutes
or
in
any
way
unreasonable
or
violated
of
personal
rights.
in
1953
after
this
court's
decision
in
adler,
the
board
of
regents
proceeded
as
the
statute
required
it
to
do
to
hold
hearings
upon
others
and
to
make
listings
of
those
organizations
which
you'd
found
to
be
subversive
within
the
meaning
of
the
new
york
statute
then
12-a
of
the
civil
service
law
now
section
105
because
the
only
thing
which
the
feinberg
law
did
was
to
implement
that
statute.
the
feinberg
law
itself
did
not
make
any
definition
of
subversion.
it
merely
provided
a
procedure
for
implementing
that
disqualification
for
employment
by
the
state
of
new
york
which
had
long
been
contained
of
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
law
and
it
did
interest
this
court
knows
from
its
consideration
in
the
adler
case
by
providing
or
upon
notice
in
hearing
listing
of
organizations
found
to
support
those
illegal
objectives
of
force
to
overthrow
the
government.
after
the
hearing,
the
listing
--
the
organizations
listed
were
two,
the
communist
party
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
the
regents
duly
listed
them,
promulgated
them,
put
it
in
their
circular
in
which
the
feinberg
law
was
explained
to
the
schools
to
which
it
applied
and
thereafter
the
presumption
which
adler
had
said
was
proper.
it
was
proper
to
infer
the
fact
from
the
facts
found,
the
ultimate
fact
from
the
facts
found.
thereafter
there
was
a
presumption
under
the
new
york
statute
that
those
organizations
--
that
member
--
knowing
membership
in
those
organizations
disqualified
â€“
this
knowing
membership
disqualified
for
employment
in
the
public
schools.
now
in
as
much
to
answer
one
of
your
honors
question,
in
as
much
as
all
the
feinberg
law
does
is
implement
the
civil
service
law
and
the
civil
service
law
itself
requires
knowing
advocacy
by
the
individual.
my
own
feeling
and
i
think
the
university's
construction
of
the
statute
has
not
been
that
mere
membership
susceptible
of
being
innocent
is
sufficient.
it
must
be
a
membership
which
presumptively
supports
the
objective,
the
illegal
objectives
of
the
party
but
in
which
the
member
individually
shares
because
that's
what
the
civil
service
law
dis
--
that's
the
disqualification
of
the
civil
service
law
individual
advocacy
of
the
violence
or
otherwise
unlawful
overthrow
of
government.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
the
finding
not
made
by
my
university
but
by
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
for
all
public
employees.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
knowingly,
deliberately
the
unlawful
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
knowing
of
its
objectives,
he
presumptively
supports
those
objections.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
yes,
and
because
this
is
a
presumption
and
only
a
presumption,
it's
susceptible
of
being
overcome
and
in
the
thompson
against
wallin
case
which
was
one
of
those
affirmed
in
adler,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
specifically
said,
because
it's
only
prima
facie,
this
imports
the
hearing
at
which
the
countervailing
evidence
can
be
given.
and
it
says
that
countervailing
evidence
goes
forth,
the
presumption
disappears.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
the
presumption
then
would
prevail.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
if
there
were
affirmative
evidence
on
his
part
to
that
effect,
then
i
think
thompson
against
wallin
says
he
has
overcome
the
presumption
and
the
presumption
disappeared
but
then
if
he
is
still
declared
ineligible
to
be
appointed
or
is
then
held
to
the
--
is
then
discharged
because
of
this,
the
burden
he
is
then
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
section
105
of
the
civil
service
law
which
is
expressly
provided
for
him
by
that
statute
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
the
burden
is
on
the
removing
officer
to
show
that
he
is
disqualified
and
i
think
that
to
show
that
he
was
disqualified
would
require
showing
that
he
did
those
things
which
you
proscribe
by
105
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
namely
person
--
what
if
--
as
i
read
thompson
against
wallin,
this
court
of
appeals
has
said,
the
presumption
arises
once
it
appears
that
he
is
a
knowing
member
of
the
organization
and
when
it
arises,
it
imports
--
one
is
relying
on
the
statutory
hearing
under
105,
it
imports
a
right
to
a
hearing
at
which
he
may
produce
evidence
to
overcome
the
presumption.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
if
he
does
so
and
if
he
is
still
discharged
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
then
i
think
--
then
i
think
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
--
that
the
new
york
statute
with
its
presumption
which
presumes
the
fact,
which
disqualifies
him
and
he
doesn't
overcome
it
and
because
this
court
has
i
submit
said
the
presumption
is
valid,
he
may
permissibly
be
discharged.
now,
i'm
coming
your
honor
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
university
employees
who
even
despite
this
could
not
be
discharge
where
they
have
tenure
under
university
procedure
--
university
policies
even
so
they
could
only
be
discharged
by
being
--
by
the
procedure
provided
in
the
university's
policies
for
terminating
a
tenure
as
follows.
and
that
so,
they
--
i
want
to
say
this
before
my
time
expires.
they
were
not
threatened
with
immediate
dismissal.
the
only
thing
that
was
ever
said
was
that
here
is
the
thing
which
the
university
has
the
procedure
it
has
done
to
comply
with
its
own
statutory
duties
under
a
statute
of
new
york.
you
are
asked
to
comply
with
it,
to
give
us
the
information
we
need
to
determine
whether
you
are
qualified.
when
we
get
this
information
then
either
we
can
find
that
you
are
qualified
or
we
can
make
the
further
inquiry
which
may
be
necessary
and
give
you
the
opportunity
to
furnish
us
any
further
information
which
you
may
wish
to
but
unless
you
give
it
to
us,
we
cannot
comply
with
our
statutory
duty
and
what
was
said
to
them
was
if
you
do
not
do
this
then
we
will
have
to
make
charges
against
him
of
insubordination
and
refusing
to
comply
with
the
university
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
well,
he
would
have
--
the
thing
i
think
i
am
trying
to
make
clear
here
is
that
those
faculty
employees
who
had
tenure
either
term
or
continues
would
have
a
hearing
and
before
a
university
body
in
which
if
they
chose
to
refuse
to
reply
and
they
could
explain
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
--
they
could
explain
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
if
your
honor
please
the
only
other
thing
that
i
would
wish
to
add
is
that
the
university
having
adopted
this
procedure
in
1956.
there's
been
no
precipitant
haste
by
the
university
here.
there's
been
no
drastic
action
that
it
has
weighed
its
procedures
carefully.
it's
done
so
in
an
effort
to
comply
with
the
state
law
by
which
its
administrative
officers
by
their
own
knows
their
bound
and
it
had
done
so
not
by
asking
any
oath
because
the
certificate
is
not
an
oath.
it's
an
oath
at
all.
it
didn't
ask
anyone
to
forswear
his
beliefs.
it
didn't
ask
him
to
conform
to
any
vaguely
specify
to
ask
him
the
very
thing
which
the
new
york
statute
of
the
regents'
procedure
may
have
reckoned
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
yes.
yes,
there
would
be
your
honor
because
i
think
under
the
university
procedures
which
provide
for
hearing
in
the
dismissal
only
upon
notice
of
hearing
which
i
have
notice
some
hearing
in
the
event
of
those
who
have
tenure
and
temporary
in
terms
--
temporary
employees
do
not,
term
employees
do.
they
would
get
a
hearing,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
just
to
two
persons
under
the
new
york
statute
but
if
he
lied,
i
think
this
would
be
misconduct
of
the
time
which
warrant
is
removed.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
just
like
to
think
that
the
university
officials
would
ever
be
arbitrary
but
let's
assume
actually
that
your
honor's
question
that
they
were.
if
that
happened
then
i
think
105
of
the
civil
service
law
itself
say,
if
he
is
dismissed
on
that
ground
that
he
is
a
subversive
then
105
says
that
he
can
go
into
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
bring
in
a
proceeding,
have
that
decision
reviewed
and
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is
disqualified
is
on
the
university.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
without
a
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
assuming
that
he
has
before
the
university
brought
forth
countervailing
proof.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
it
must
be
evidence
in
some
proof
your
honor
and
not
any.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
of
course
the
state
of
his
mind
is
only
he
knows
but
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
he
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
he
might
be
subject
to
some
probing
of
the
validity
of
that
statement
but
ones
that
stood
under
it
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
well,
here
of
course
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
--
i'm
bound
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
thompson
against
wallin
and
what
it
seems
to
me
to
say
and
again,
i
point
out
that
the
attorney
general
is
here
taking
the
position
that
he
takes
in
support
of
this
statute
but
i
read
thompson
against
wallin
that
say
that
the
prima
facie
nature
of
the
assumption
imports
a
hearing
in
which
proof
can
be
brought
forth
and
that
when
any
proof
is
brought
forth
to
overcome
that
presumption
that
disappeared.
that's
what
i
read
out
--
that's
what
i
read
in
thompson
against
wallin.
of
course,
the
court
only
--
the
court
knows
precisely
what
it
meant
but
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
with
that
i
prefer
to
let
the
attorney
general
speak
for
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
would
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
am

i
distinguish
the

had

i
apologize
for
my

my

is
to
--
we
rely
upon
the
attorney
general's
position,
who
has
the
duty
of
defending
the
validity
of

we
rely
upon
and
support
the
position
which
the

has
taken
in
this
case
in
support
of
this

my
concern
here
is
to
attempt
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the

in
carrying
out
the

found
to

within
the
meaning
of
the
new

then
12-a
of
the
civil

now
section

because
the
only
thing
which

did

the

the
feinberg
law
was
explained
to
the
schools
to
which
it
applied
and
thereafter
the
presumption
which
adler
had
said
was
proper.
it
was
proper
to
infer
the
fact
from
the
facts
found,
the
ultimate
fact
from
the
facts
found.
thereafter
there
was
a
presumption
under
the
new
york
statute
that
those
organizations
--
that
member
--
knowing
membership
in
those
organizations
disqualified
â€“
this
knowing
membership
disqualified
for
employment
in
the
public
schools.
now
in
as
much
to
answer
one
of
your
honors
question,
in
as
much
as
all
the
feinberg
law
does
is
implement
the
civil
service
law
and
the
civil
service
law
itself
requires
knowing
advocacy
by
the
individual.
my
own
feeling
and
i
think
the
university's
construction
of
the
statute
has
not
been
that
mere
membership
susceptible
of
being
innocent
is
sufficient.
it
must
be
a
membership
which
presumptively
supports
the
objective,
the
illegal
objectives
of
the
party
but
in
which
the
member
individually
shares
because
that's
what
the
civil
service
law
dis
--
that's
the
disqualification
of
the
civil
service
law
individual
advocacy
of
the
violence
or
otherwise
unlawful
overthrow
of
government.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
the
finding
not
made
by
my
university
but
by
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
for
all
public
employees.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
knowingly,
deliberately
the
unlawful
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
knowing
of
its
objectives,
he
presumptively
supports
those
objections.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
yes,
and
because
this
is
a
presumption
and
only
a
presumption,
it's
susceptible
of
being
overcome
and
in
the
thompson
against
wallin
case
which
was
one
of
those
affirmed
in
adler,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
specifically
said,
because
it's
only
prima
facie,
this
imports
the
hearing
at
which
the
countervailing
evidence
can
be
given.
and
it
says
that
countervailing
evidence
goes
forth,
the
presumption
disappears.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
the
presumption
then
would
prevail.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
if
there
were
affirmative
evidence
on
his
part
to
that
effect,
then
i
think
thompson
against
wallin
says
he
has
overcome
the
presumption
and
the
presumption
disappeared
but
then
if
he
is
still
declared
ineligible
to
be
appointed
or
is
then
held
to
the
--
is
then
discharged
because
of
this,
the
burden
he
is
then
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
section
105
of
the
civil
service
law
which
is
expressly
provided
for
him
by
that
statute
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
the
burden
is
on
the
removing
officer
to
show
that
he
is
disqualified
and
i
think
that
to
show
that
he
was
disqualified
would
require
showing
that
he
did
those
things
which
you
proscribe
by
105
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
namely
person
--
what
if
--
as
i
read
thompson
against
wallin,
this
court
of
appeals
has
said,
the
presumption
arises
once
it
appears
that
he
is
a
knowing
member
of
the
organization
and
when
it
arises,
it
imports
--
one
is
relying
on
the
statutory
hearing
under
105,
it
imports
a
right
to
a
hearing
at
which
he
may
produce
evidence
to
overcome
the
presumption.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
if
he
does
so
and
if
he
is
still
discharged
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
then
i
think
--
then
i
think
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
--
that
the
new
york
statute
with
its
presumption
which
presumes
the
fact,
which
disqualifies
him
and
he
doesn't
overcome
it
and
because
this
court
has
i
submit
said
the
presumption
is
valid,
he
may
permissibly
be
discharged.
now,
i'm
coming
your
honor
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
university
employees
who
even
despite
this
could
not
be
discharge
where
they
have
tenure
under
university
procedure
--
university
policies
even
so
they
could
only
be
discharged
by
being
--
by
the
procedure
provided
in
the
university's
policies
for
terminating
a
tenure
as
follows.
and
that
so,
they
--
i
want
to
say
this
before
my
time
expires.
they
were
not
threatened
with
immediate
dismissal.
the
only
thing
that
was
ever
said
was
that
here
is
the
thing
which
the
university
has
the
procedure
it
has
done
to
comply
with
its
own
statutory
duties
under
a
statute
of
new
york.
you
are
asked
to
comply
with
it,
to
give
us
the
information
we
need
to
determine
whether
you
are
qualified.
when
we
get
this
information
then
either
we
can
find
that
you
are
qualified
or
we
can
make
the
further
inquiry
which
may
be
necessary
and
give
you
the
opportunity
to
furnish
us
any
further
information
which
you
may
wish
to
but
unless
you
give
it
to
us,
we
cannot
comply
with
our
statutory
duty
and
what
was
said
to
them
was
if
you
do
not
do
this
then
we
will
have
to
make
charges
against
him
of
insubordination
and
refusing
to
comply
with
the
university
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
well,
he
would
have
--
the
thing
i
think
i
am
trying
to
make
clear
here
is
that
those
faculty
employees
who
had
tenure
either
term
or
continues
would
have
a
hearing
and
before
a
university
body
in
which
if
they
chose
to
refuse
to
reply
and
they
could
explain
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
--
they
could
explain
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
if
your
honor
please
the
only
other
thing
that
i
would
wish
to
add
is
that
the
university
having
adopted
this
procedure
in
1956.
there's
been
no
precipitant
haste
by
the
university
here.
there's
been
no
drastic
action
that
it
has
weighed
its
procedures
carefully.
it's
done
so
in
an
effort
to
comply
with
the
state
law
by
which
its
administrative
officers
by
their
own
knows
their
bound
and
it
had
done
so
not
by
asking
any
oath
because
the
certificate
is
not
an
oath.
it's
an
oath
at
all.
it
didn't
ask
anyone
to
forswear
his
beliefs.
it
didn't
ask
him
to
conform
to
any
vaguely
specify
to
ask
him
the
very
thing
which
the
new
york
statute
of
the
regents'
procedure
may
have
reckoned
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
yes.
yes,
there
would
be
your
honor
because
i
think
under
the
university
procedures
which
provide
for
hearing
in
the
dismissal
only
upon
notice
of
hearing
which
i
have
notice
some
hearing
in
the
event
of
those
who
have
tenure
and
temporary
in
terms
--
temporary
employees
do
not,
term
employees
do.
they
would
get
a
hearing,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
just
to
two
persons
under
the
new
york
statute
but
if
he
lied,
i
think
this
would
be
misconduct
of
the
time
which
warrant
is
removed.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
just
like
to
think
that
the
university
officials
would
ever
be
arbitrary
but
let's
assume
actually
that
your
honor's
question
that
they
were.
if
that
happened
then
i
think
105
of
the
civil
service
law
itself
say,
if
he
is
dismissed
on
that
ground
that
he
is
a
subversive
then
105
says
that
he
can
go
into
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
bring
in
a
proceeding,
have
that
decision
reviewed
and
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is
disqualified
is
on
the
university.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
without
a
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
assuming
that
he
has
before
the
university
brought
forth
countervailing
proof.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
it
must
be
evidence
in
some
proof
your
honor
and
not
any.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
of
course
the
state
of
his
mind
is
only
he
knows
but
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
he
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
he
might
be
subject
to
some
probing
of
the
validity
of
that
statement
but
ones
that
stood
under
it
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
well,
here
of
course
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
--
i'm
bound
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
thompson
against
wallin
and
what
it
seems
to
me
to
say
and
again,
i
point
out
that
the
attorney
general
is
here
taking
the
position
that
he
takes
in
support
of
this
statute
but
i
read
thompson
against
wallin
that
say
that
the
prima
facie
nature
of
the
assumption
imports
a
hearing
in
which
proof
can
be
brought
forth
and
that
when
any
proof
is
brought
forth
to
overcome
that
presumption
that
disappeared.
that's
what
i
read
out
--
that's
what
i
read
in
thompson
against
wallin.
of
course,
the
court
only
--
the
court
knows
precisely
what
it
meant
but
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
with
that
i
prefer
to
let
the
attorney
general
speak
for
it.
mr.
john
c.
crary,
jr.
i
would
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed,
your
honor.
