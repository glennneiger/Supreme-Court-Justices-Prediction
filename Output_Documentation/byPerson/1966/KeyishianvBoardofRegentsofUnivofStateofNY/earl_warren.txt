i
just
like
to
ask
one
question
mr.

suppose
he
admits
his
membership
in
a
communist
party
and
you
rely
--
relying
on
the
presumption,
require
him
to
show
that
to
overcome
it
that
he
isn't
a
knowing
member
in
the
sense
that
he
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
he
takes
the
stand
and
says,
well,
i
did
belong
--
i
did
belong
to
it
but
i
didn't
subscribe
to
those
things.
i
just
don't
belong

are
certain
things
in

party
that
i
agreed
with

the
board
just
said
to
him,
well,
we
don't
believe
you.
you're
discharged
now.
is
it
susceptible
to
that
kind
of
action?
i
don't
accuse
the
university
of
doing
it,
but
could
it
be
done
in
that
way
without
anymore
testimony
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

he
goes
before
the
civil
service
commission,
what
--
and
has
this
hearing,
what
do
you
reply
upon
to
say
that
the
state
no
longer
can
use
the
presumption
against
him
but
must
prove
its
case
affirmatively.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
finish
i
would
like
to
ask
ms.
iles
if

is
the
position
of
the
attorney
general.
though,
i
do
not
want
to
hurry.
chief
justice

can
be
sustained,just
